ABSTRACT
Thalidomide, a drug known for its teratogenic side-effects, is used successfully to
treat a variety of clinical conditions including leprosy and multiple myeloma. Intense
efforts are underway to synthesize and identify safer, clinically relevant analogs. Here,
we conduct a preliminary in vivo screen of a library of new thalidomide analogs to
determine which agents demonstrate activity, and describe a cohort of compounds
with anti-angiogenic properties, anti-inflammatory properties and some compounds
which exhibited both. The combination of the in vivo zebrafish and chicken embryo
model systems allows for the accelerated discovery of new, potential therapies for
cancerous and inflammatory conditions.

Thalidomide possesses anti-angiogenic actions in the
rabbit corneal micropocket assay [10], the rat aortic ring assay
(in the presence of human liver microsomes), and in in vitro
cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs),
[6, 11–15]. This action has been linked to the damage to
embryos following thalidomide exposure [3, 6, 8, 10].
Thalidomide also possesses immunomodulatory characteristics
[16, 17]. The immunological basis for the clinical efficacy of
thalidomide lies in its ability to inhibit the synthesis of tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), a major inflammatory cytokine
[17, 18]. Thalidomide’s combined anti-angiogenic and antiinflammatory properties likely lead to its anti-cancer effects
and efficacy in the treatment of multiple myeloma [19, 20] as
well as documented activity in other cancers [21].
Given the efficacy of thalidomide analogs and
expanding clinical use, developing safer thalidomide
analogs with improved activity and less toxicity is a
continuing research effort. The novel analogs used in
the current study were designed around the tricyclic ring
structure of thalidomide. A library of 81 structural analogs

INTRODUCTION
Thalidomide was first marketed in Germany in 1957
as a non-barbiturate, non-addictive, non-toxic sedative
which was also used to treat morning sickness in pregnant
women [1–4]. It was withdrawn from the world market
in late 1961 after it was found to be a potent teratogen
[2–4] having caused birth defects in over 10,000 children.
These children showed similar anatomical limb reduction
malformations including phocomelia, an absence or
reduction of the long bones in the forelimb, or amelia, a
complete absence of the forelimb [2, 4, 5]. Other commonly
seen phenotypic malformations were also documented
including eye, ear, heart, gastrointestinal and kidney
defects [2, 6–8]. The thalidomide disaster emphasized the
importance of thorough drug screening and the potential for
drug species specificity, as rodents were not susceptible to
thalidomide. As a direct result new candidate drugs are now
tested in at least two animal species (one of which must be
non-rodent) before clinical testing [9].

were chemically synthesized and screened in the zebrafish
embryo and chicken embryo model systems. Our study
utilizes two established transgenic zebrafish reporter lines,
fli1:EGFP and Tg(mpo::EGFP)114, to identify potential
anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory compounds,
respectively [12, 22-25]. Here we describe the 13 lead
compounds that exhibit either anti-angiogenic, antiinflammatory, or both, properties. The multiple zebrafish
assays, used in conjunction with the in ovo chicken
embryo assay, also help to provide a potential teratogenic
profile for each lead compound.

with the drug (Figure 2A). Compounds C4, C18, C81,
C82, C83 and C84 exhibited anti-angiogenic activity, as
indicated by loss of ISVs or inhibition of ISV outgrowth
in fli1:EGFP zebrafish embryos (Figure 2B–2C). We
also observed that the potency of each compound varied.
Table 1 shows the lowest effective concentration of each
compound exhibiting a response. For example, C4 was
anti-angiogenic at 1.5 μg/mL (4.9 μM), as determined by
inhibition of vessel outgrowth and number. In contrast C81
only showed inhibitory activity at 50 μg/mL (161.07 μM).

Anti-inflammatory thalidomide analogs reduce
neutrophil migration in response to injury in the
Tg(MPO::EGFP)114 zebrafish

RESULTS
Anti-angiogenic thalidomide analogs disrupt
vessel formation in fli1:EGFP zebrafish embryos

To assess the immunomodulatory effects of the
thalidomide analogs across the concentration range
used in the previous assay, the transgenic zebrafish line
Tg(MPO::EGFP)114 was used. These embryos express GFP
tagged myeloperoxidase, marking neutrophils during the
inflammatory response, for example following injury [23,
24]. The inflammatory response in zebrafish embryos is
active from 3 days post fertilization [24] and can clearly
be demonstrated following removal of the dorsal third of
the tail fin. This allowed us to subsequently assess the antiinflammatory activity of each compound by immersing
embryos in the test drug or vehicle. The embryos were

To determine if our novel thalidomide analogs
(Figure 1) had any effect on in vivo angiogenesis,
we used fli1:EGFP embryos which express green
fluorescent protein (GFP) on endothelial cells throughout
development [22]. Embryos were allowed to develop for
24 hours, then exposed to either vehicle or a compound
of interest at the concentration range of 1 to 200 μg/mL.
During this time the vasculature is rapidly expanding and
developing new, naive intersegmental vessels (ISVs).
The embryos were imaged after 24 hours of incubation

examined for migration of neutrophils to the wound site.
In comparison to control embryos (Figure 3A) compounds
with anti-inflammatory properties had reduction of at
least 50% of neutrophils recruited to the wound site
(Figure 3). Compounds C2, C7, C24, C29, C58, C59 and
C86 reduced neutrophil migration. We also screened the
previously identified six anti-angiogenic compounds of
interest in the Tg(MPO::EGFP)114 line. C18 and C82 were
seen to significantly reduce neutrophil migration, and thus
were classified as having both anti-angiogenic and antiinflammatory properties in these assays (Figure 3B).

and digit defects (compound C82), and hemorrhaging
(compounds C4, C81, C83, C84, C24) (Table 2, Figure 4).
Chicken embryos treated with these compounds often had
abnormal blood vessels and necrotic-like regions in the
surrounding yolk sac membrane (compounds C4, C18,
C83, C24).
To determine the effects of the lead candidate
compounds on embryonic development, compounds were
tested in the developing zebrafish model during a stage
of rapid organogenesis (24 hpf) [23]. Anti-angiogenic
compounds caused developmental issues in the zebrafish
embryo, including reducing eye diameter (Figure 4C,
Figure 4G), pectoral fin outgrowth malformations (Figure
4D, Figure 4H) and twisted spines (Figure 4C).
Of the lead anti-inflammatory compounds, compounds
C24 and C29 exhibited developmental defects in chicken
embryos causing hemorrhaging and necrotic-like damage in
the YSM. Compounds C2, C7, C58, C59 and C86 had no
effect on chicken embryo development.

All anti-angiogenic and some anti-inflammatory
compounds are teratogenic in the developing
chicken and zebrafish model systems
Compounds of interest were screened in chicken
and/or zebrafish embryos (Figure 4), to determine if
these compounds are teratogenic. The chicken embryo
is well established as a model to determine the action
of compounds upon development [6, 12, 23, 25–27].All
the identified anti-angiogenic compounds (Structures
in Supplementary Table S1) caused defects to the
embryos. Teratogenicity in the chicken embryo included
microphthalmia (compound C81), reduced body size
compared to control embryos (compound C18), limb

DISCUSSION
Thalidomide and its analogs are currently under
investigation for the treatment of a range of auto-immune
and inflammatory conditions, as well as certain cancers
[28]. The continued use of thalidomide has emphasized

model systems. Utilizing these assays we have screened 81
compounds and shown that a subset of analogs displayed
desirable actions at low concentrations in vivo. We have
selected 13 lead candidate compounds from these cohorts
based on their activity profiles.
Compounds C4, C18, C81, C82, C83 and C84 were
found to decrease vessel length or the number of sprouting
vessels at relatively low concentrations (1.5 μg/mL - 100 μg/
mL), similar to concentration ranges used in other screening
studies [23, 25, 33]. Some compounds with anti-angiogenic
actions were found to induce death and defects within the
treated embryos, reflecting the importance of vascular
development for embryogenesis. This complements other
studies that suggest a primary cause of thalidomide-induced
birth defects may be incorrect patterning of the vasculature
in affected tissues [6, 12].
We identified several analogs with potent activity
against the inflammatory response in vivo at low
concentrations compared to previous studies of other
thalidomide analogs [23]. Of these compounds, C2, C7,
C58, C59 and C86 were found to be anti-inflammatory
without anti-angiogenic activities and were nonteratogenic in these assays, and thus may be acting
independently of the mechanism that induces defects
in the developing embryo. Importantly, we cannot rule
out that at higher concentrations, or in other animal
models, they could be teratogenic. C58 was the most
effective analog at inhibiting the inflammatory response,
decreasing the migration of neutrophils to 10% of the
control (Figure 3). Interestingly, the structure of C58
(5-Aza-thalidomide) is very similar to pomalidomide, a
derivative of thalidomide with potent immunomodulatory
actions [34, 35]. However, unlike pomalidomide, C58
includes a pyridine ring. Whether this analog shares a
similar mechanism of action to pomalidomide remains to
be determined. Of additional note, C2 (2,3-dihydro-2-(2oxo-6-thioxo-3-piperidinyl)-3-thioxo-1H-isoindol-1-one)
also possessed significant anti-inflammatory action. This
agent, also known as 3,6′-dithiothalidomide, has been
shown to potently lower lipopolysaccharide (LPS)induced elevations in TNF-α in cultured RAW 264.7 cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as well as in the plasma and brain of rats challenged with
systemic LPS [33, 36]. The compound also dramatically
mitigates neuroinflammation and improves outcome
measures in animal models of traumatic brain injury [37],
stroke [38], Alzheimer’s disease [33, 39, 40] and aneurysm
[41]. Together, these prior studies cross-validate the antiinflammatory actions evident within the present study.
While most anti-inflammatory compounds did not induce
embryonic defects, C24 and C29 caused some effects in
the developing chicken embryo including twisted spinal
cords, necrotic-like damage in the YSM and high death
rates. Thalidomide inhibits TNF-α expression which is
vital for the induction of an inflammatory response [42].
Given that TNF-α can be protective to rodent embryos
exposed to teratogenic insults [43] it may also be that a
reduction of TNF-α somehow impedes the development
of the chicken and zebrafish embryos. Further studies
elucidating this developmental mechanism would aid in
the use of chicken and zebrafish embryos for the screening
of developmental toxicity and embryotoxic potency of
compounds (e.g. other TNF-α inhibitors) during early drug
development. Reports on the risk of birth defects after
embryonic exposure to TNF-α inhibitors are contradictory,
with some indicating they may be teratogenic [44] and
other studies reporting their safety [45, 46]. It is important
to point out that thalidomide exerts its anti-inflammatory
effects through multiple pathways including TNF-α
and COX-2 inhibition. The fact that our current study
identified some anti-inflammatory thalidomide analogs
that produced mild defects (compared with thalidomide
embryopathy in humans) suggests that the effects of
thalidomide and its analogs on the embryos may involve
multiple targets. Using our screening models, we can
identify those that are potently anti-inflammatory analogs
but are non-teratogenic. Given the species specificity
of thalidomide and that animal studies do not always
correlate to human responses, extrapolation of this data
should be carried out with caution.
Several compounds from our library, such as C18
and C82, exhibited both anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties in our assays (structures found in
33241

Oncotarget

Supplementary Table 3). Tumors require a blood supply
to survive [47] and the tumor microenvironment includes
a high level of cytokine activity (including COX-2, TNF-α
and interleukins). Therefore, compounds inhibiting both
vessel formation and the inflammatory response may be
beneficial for anti-cancer therapy [48, 49].
The effects of novel thalidomide analogs in this
study provide primary data as evidence for their clinical

potential. Studies are underway in our laboratory for
further testing in in vitro cellular and in vivo animal
models of various disease states as well as to delineate
the molecular mechanisms of the lead compounds. In
particular, if the compounds act by binding to cereblon,
a recently established molecular target of thalidomide,
lenalidomide and pomalidomide [50, 51]. Given that
these compounds could be divided into distinct cohorts

based on their activities we hypothesized there may be
some correlation between the structural modifications
and their activity in these assays. To assess this across the
library of compounds we are conducting structure-activity
relationship studies. Due to the range of teratogenicity
seen in the developing chicken model system with some of
these thalidomide-related compounds, it will be interesting
to assess whether or not the compounds have a direct effect
on cells or if the anti-cancer action is purely mediated by
the inhibition of angiogenesis. While it has been shown in
previous studies that thalidomide exhibits multiple effects
[52], the compounds screened here will require additional
characterization to establish if they also exert sedative or
neurotoxic effects in addition to their anti-inflammatory
or anti-angiogenic properties. The iterative process of
continued synthesis and screening of thalidomide analogs
increases the chances of finding a form of the drug that
acts with tissue specificity, increased potency and reduced
unwanted effects.

All embryo work was fully licensed and carried
out with ethical review permissions and following all
regulatory guidelines.

Thalidomide analogs
A broad series of novel thalidomide-based
compounds were chemically synthesized (WL, NHG
and WDF, NIH), dissolved in DMSO, stored in stock
concentrations between 10-100 mg/mL, and used at a
final working DMSO concentration of 0.1%. The chemical
structures of lead compounds of interest were confirmed
by chemical characterization (purity >99.5%). Compounds
were screened across a range of concentrations from 1-200
μg/mL to determine the lowest effective concentration.

Imaging and analysis
Imaging was performed using a Nikon MZ1500
fluorescent stereomicroscope with a Nikon DS-5 digital
camera and analyzed using Adobe photoshop and Image
J. Analysis was conducted using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA) and statistical significance was
assessed using two-tailed Student’s t tests or ANOVA
analyses. Error bars represent standard error of the mean.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Zebrafish embryology
Zebrafish embryos were treated with analogs as
previously described [23]. Briefly, fli1:EGFP embryos
were collected and embryos were allowed to develop
for 24 hours. Embryos were dechorionated manually
and exposed to test compounds or vehicle control (0.1%
DMSO) for a further 24 hours. Embryos were anesthetized
with 0.05% MS222 (Tricaine) (Sigma Aldrich) and live
visualization of blood vessels was carried out.
Tg(MPO::EGFP)114 embryos were tail fin clipped
as previously detailed [23, 24] and incubated with
test compounds or vehicle control at 72 hpf. Fish
were imaged at 24 hours and the number of migratory
neutrophils present at the wound site were counted.
Compounds inducing an at least 50% reduction of
neutrophils to the wound site were considered to have
anti-inflammatory properties in this system.All larvae
were assessed for viability and morphological integrity.
A minimum of 10 embryos were used per concentration
per drug. Error bars represent standard error of the
mean.
