ABSTRACT
Background: A germline deletion in the BIM (BCL2L11) gene has been shown
to impair the apoptotic response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in vitro but its
association with poor outcomes in TKI-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

patients remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on
both aggregate and individual patient data to address this issue.
Results: In an aggregate data meta-analysis (n = 1429), the BIM deletion
was associated with inferior PFS (HR = 1.51, 95%CI = 1.06–2.13, P = 0.02). Using
individual patient data (n = 1200), we found a significant interaction between the
deletion and ethnicity. Amongst non-Koreans, the deletion was an independent
predictor of shorter PFS (Chinese: HR = 1.607, 95%CI = 1.251–2.065, P = 0.0002;
Japanese: HR = 2.636, 95%CI = 1.603–4.335, P = 0.0001), and OS (HR = 1.457,
95% CI = 1.063–1.997, P = 0.019). In Kaplan-Meier analyses, the BIM deletion was
associated with shorter survival in non-Koreans (PFS: 8.0 months v 11.1 months,
P < 0.0005; OS: 25.7 v 30.0 months, P = 0.042). In Koreans, the BIM deletion was
not predictive of PFS or OS.
Materials and Methods: 10 published and 3 unpublished studies that reported
survival outcomes in NSCLC patients stratified according to BIM deletion were
identified from PubMed and Embase. Summary risk estimates were calculated from
aggregate patient data using a random-effects model. For individual patient data,
Kaplan-Meier analyses were supported by multivariate Cox regression to estimate
hazard ratios (HRs) for PFS and OS.
Conclusions: In selected populations, the BIM deletion is a significant predictor of
shorter PFS and OS on EGFR-TKIs. Further studies to determine its effect on response
to other BIM-dependent therapeutic agents are needed, so that alternative treatment
strategies may be devised.

INTRODUCTION

polymorphism appeared to occur at a frequency of 12.3%
in East Asians but was absent in Caucasian populations
[22]. When introduced into NSCLC cell lines, the deletion
resulted in an increase in the production of non-apoptotic
isoforms at the expense of apoptotic isoforms, and relative
resistance to EGFR-TKIs [22]. Importantly, it has also
been shown that resistance conferred by the deletion
could be overcome in vitro with HDAC inhibitors [23],
and BH3 mimetics [22]. It was therefore hypothesised that
the BIM deletion would have an impact on the sensitivity
of EGFR-addicted tumors to EGFR-TKIs, and indeed the
polymorphism was associated with shorter progressionfree survival (PFS) in a retrospective EGFR-TKI-treated
NSCLC cohort from Singapore and Japan [22].
Since then, other centers across East Asia, including
China and Taiwan, have investigated the association
between the BIM polymorphism and treatment outcome
in both prospective and retrospective TKI-treated NSCLC
patient cohorts, with conflicting results [24–30]. Notably,
the two studies that reported a lack of association
originated from South Korea, raising the question if the
effect of the deletion may be modulated by ethnicity.
Furthermore, although the BIM deletion was initially
thought to be exclusive to East Asian populations, it has
been recently reported in a Columbian population [31].
Hence, an understanding of the true effect of the deletion
on TKI treatment outcomes in different ethnic populations
is important for predicting response and guiding treatment
strategies in East Asian populations, and potentially
beyond East Asian populations.
A number of aggregate data meta-analyses that have
been published have suggested that the BIM polymorphism

While sensitizing mutations in the EGFR gene
predict very high response rates among patients with
NSCLC [1–3], up to 30% of such patients fail to
experience optimum responses [4, 5]. The identification
of factors which predict patient response is important for
both clinical and economic reasons [6-8], and is especially
relevant for East Asian populations where the incidence
of EGFR-mutated NSCLC is at least 4-fold higher than
among non-East Asian populations [9].
Several mechanisms to explain the heterogeneity
of TKI responses have been previously described
[10–13]. In particular, impaired expression/function of
BIM (BCL2L11), resulting in failure of TKI-induced
apoptosis has been associated with TKI resistance in
preclinical models [14–18]. BIM is a pro-apoptotic
protein that is upregulated upon TKI treatment and
binds to pro-survival BCL-2 family members via its
BH3 domain, thereby initiating programmed cell death
[19]. Accordingly, BIM expression has been found to
represent a key node in determining responses to cancer
drug therapy in general [20]. Of note, recent data from the
European Tarceva (EURTAC) trial demonstrated poorer
outcomes in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients with low BIM
expression, further supporting the importance of intact
apoptotic machinery in such populations [21]. Together,
these studies highlight BIM function as a critical factor in
determining patient responses to cancer therapies.
Recently, a 2.9kb intronic deletion in the BIM
gene that biases splicing towards non-apoptotic isoforms
lacking the BH3 domain was discovered [22]. This deletion

Progression-free survival on EGFR-TKIs in
patients with and without the BIM deletion

is indeed associated with shorter PFS on EGFR-TKIs
[32–35]. However, these meta-analyses were limited by
the use of summary statistics from published studies. The
alternative approach, based on individual patient data,
offers several clinical and statistical advantages [36]. In
this collaborative study, we used individual patient data
from published and unpublished studies to perform a
meta-analysis on the effect of the BIM polymorphism on
PFS and OS in EGFR-TKI-treated NSCLC patients as the
primary aim.

We first performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis on the
pooled individual patient dataset (n = 1200) to determine
the PFS on EGFR-TKIs of patients segregated according
to previously reported prognostic factors, in particular,
the BIM deletion. We found that patients with the BIM
deletion had a significantly shorter median PFS of 9.2
months compared to 11.0 months in those without the
deletion (P = 0.002) (Figure 2A). As expected, log-rank
p values for Kaplan-Meier analyses were also significant
for well-validated predictors of survival such as histology
(P = 0.001), EGFR phenotype (P < 0.0005), gender
(P < 0.0005), smoking history (P = 0.024), and stage
(P < 0.005). In addition, country (P < 0.0005), center
(P < 0.0005), ethnicity (P < 0.0005) also emerged as
significant predictors of PFS (data not shown).
Considering that ethnicity subsumes center and
country, we focussed on investigating the effect of the BIM
deletion stratified by ethnicity (Supplementary Figure 1),
and found that Korean patients with and without the
deletion—contrary to the other ethnicities—had similar
PFS (11.9 v 10.9 months; P = 0.474) (Figure 2C). In
contrast, an analysis of non-Korean patients showed
a significant difference in PFS in patients with and
without the BIM deletion (8.0 v 11.1 months; P < 0.0005)
(Figure 2E).
To support our findings from the Kaplan-Meier
analysis, we used Cox regression analysis to identify
significant factors associated with shorter PFS in patients
on EGFR-TKI treatment. Here, the BIM deletion emerged
as a significant risk factor for reduced PFS in both the
univariate (HR = 1.323, 95% CI = 1.108–1.581, P = 0.002)
and stepwise multivariate Cox regression analyses (HR
= 1.406, 95% CI = 1.174–1.684, P < 0.0005) (Table 2).
To explore the extent to which ethnicity moderated
the effect of the BIM deletion on PFS, an interaction
term (BIM deletion x ethnicity) was incorporated into
the Cox regression model (Table 3). This analysis
yielded significant main effects for the BIM deletion
(P = 0.0002) and ethnicity (P = 0.0020), as well as a
significant interaction between BIM deletion and ethnicity
(P = 0.0023). The effect of the BIM deletion differed
according to ethnicity, as it was a significant risk factor
for reduced PFS in Chinese (HR = 1.607, 95% CI =
1.251–2.065, P = 0.0002) and Japanese (HR = 2.636, 95%
CI = 1.603–4.335, P = 0.0001), but not Korean patients
(HR = 0.919, 95% CI = 0.668–1.264, P = 0.603) (Table 3).

RESULTS
Search strategy
Figure 1 illustrates the search strategy used to
identify studies that investigated the association of the
BIM deletion with responses among individuals with
EGFR-mutant NSCLC. A total of 2187 unique articles
were identified from PubMed and Embase after removing
duplicate abstracts. 13 articles were selected for fulltext review after inclusion and exclusion criteria were
applied. 10 studies were eventually identified and the
corresponding authors were contacted. We received
individual patient data for 7 of these studies [22, 25–28,
30, 37]. Authors of 3 studies did not reply (n = 502)
[24, 29, 31]. Published data was supplemented with 3
additional unpublished datasets from China, Japan and
Singapore (SL, SY, WTL).
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the 13
studies we identified. In total, individual patient data from
1324 patients was received. We excluded patients if they
were not treated with TKIs, the treatment period was < 2
weeks, or BIM deletion status was unknown. Duplicate
patients were also excluded (Supplementary Table 1).
Eventually, data from 1200 NSCLC patients (representing
90.6% of the total number of patients) was used for a
pooled individual patient data meta-analysis, to determine
PFS and OS on EGFR-TKIs in the whole cohort.

Baseline characteristics of patients with and
without the BIM deletion
Baseline characteristics of the cohort as a whole, and
segregated according to BIM deletion status, are detailed in
Supplementary Table 2. Patients with or without the BIM
deletion did not differ significantly (defined as p > 0.05) in
terms of the characteristics examined, including established
prognostic factors for EGFR-mutant NSCLC [38]. All the
studies used for this pooled analysis used data from stage
III/IV NSCLC patients on EGFR-TKI monotherapy. The
majority of patients (96.4%) were treated with standard
doses of either gefitinib or erlotinib. Although the TKI
used differed according to each country’s practices,
similar outcomes have been reported in earlier studies that
compared gefitinib to erlotinib [39, 40].

Korean ethnicity. We found that the Korean and nonKorean cohorts differed in terms of ECOG status,
histology, EGFR mutation, TKI used and line of treatment
(Supplementary Table 3). We then performed subgroup
Kaplan-Meier analyses using only data from patients who
had 1) ECOG status 0 or 1, 2) adenocarcinoma histology,
3) TKI-sensitizing EGFR mutations, 4) gefitinib and/or
erlotinib treatment or 5) first-line treatment with TKIs
(Supplementary Table 4). In these subgroup analyses, the
BIM deletion remained a significant predictor of shorter
PFS in only the non-Korean patients, and not the Korean
patients. Hence, it is unlikely that these differences in
baseline characteristics contribute to the discordant effects
of the deletion on PFS in Korean and non-Korean patients.

Aggregate data meta-analysis
In view of potential study heterogeneity, and in
order to include as many studies as possible (including
the authors who did not reply to requests for IPD), we
performed a meta-analysis using a random effects model
based on aggregate patient data (n = 1429). Consistent
with results from the pooled IPD analysis, the presence of
the BIM deletion was associated with a significant overall
increase in the risk of progression compared to individuals
without the BIM deletion (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.06–2.13,
P = 0.02) in an aggregate data meta-analysis (Figure 3).
However, because there was significant
heterogeneity within the combined group (I2 = 70%,
P = 0.0001) (Figure 3), and because the 2 studies to
date that reported a lack of association between the BIM
deletion and treatment outcome originated from Korean
centers, we tested the possibility that the heterogeneity
arose from differences in non-Korean v Korean groups.
Consistent with this notion, the non-Korean groups
were found to be homogenous when analyzed separately
(I2 = 41%, P = 0.10) (Figure 3). Importantly, and consistent
with the results from the individual patient data-based
analysis, we also found that the summary HR for risk of
shorter PFS was significant in patients with the deletion in
the non-Korean studies (HR = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.42–2.50,

Overall survival on EGFR-TKIs in patients with
and without the BIM deletion
In earlier studies, there had been conflicting results
as to whether the BIM deletion predicted poorer overall
survival [27, 28, 30]. Here, for the cohort as a whole,
there was no significant difference in OS in patients with
the BIM deletion compared to those without for whom
overall survival data was available (n = 830) (26.1 v 28.9
months, P = 0.115) (Figure 2B). However, when stratified
by Korean ethnicity, there was a significant difference
in OS amongst non-Koreans with and without the BIM
deletion (25.7 v 30.5 months, P = 0.042) (Figure 2F) but
not amongst Koreans (28.2 v 27.2 months, P = 0.585)
(Figure 2D). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, the

P < 0.0001), whereas the deletion was not a significant

CI = 0.30–1.53, P = 0.35) (Figure 3).

random-effects model (Figure 3), and the use of individual
patient data has been invaluable in allowing a more
accurate quantification of the effect of the BIM deletion
on PFS according to ethnicity (Table 3).
Several possibilities may account for the
discordant effects of the deletion between Korean and nonKorean populations. Firstly, the discordant effects seen in
different ethnic populations may be a result of differences
in treatment protocols between countries, rather than
ethnicity (Korean v non-Korean) per se. However, this
is unlikely, as to our knowledge, EGFR-TKI treatment
protocols of Korean and non-Korean centers are relatively
similar. Although the Korean and non-Korean populations
differed in terms of other baseline characteristics other
than ethnicity (Supplementary Table 3), subgroup analysis
using only patients who had the same ECOG status,
histology, sensitizing EGFR mutations, TKI used and line
of treatment showed a significantly shorter PFS in nonKorean patients with the BIM deletion, but not Korean
patients.
If the discordant effect of the deletion truly arises
from differences in genetic makeup between non-Koreans
and Koreans, a possible explanation is the existence of
other genetic factors in linkage disequilibrium with
the BIM deletion that has occurred only in Korean
populations through the process of genetic drift and
divergence from the other East Asian populations. Such
factors may modulate the effect of the deletion on TKI

DISCUSSION
In the current work, we have used both pooled
individual patient data as well as aggregate patient
data to show that the germline BIM deletion, like TKIresistant EGFR mutations, predicts inferior outcomes in
selected populations. Our findings indicate that Chinese
and Japanese patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who
carry the BIM deletion polymorphism have an inferior
progression-free survival compared to those who do
not (Chinese: HR = 1.607, 95% CI = 1.251–2.065,
P = 0.0002; Japanese: HR = 2.636, 95% CI = 1.603–4.335,
P = 0.0001). Importantly, this remains the only germline
variant known to reproducibly affect clinical outcomes
in EGFR-mutant NSCLC across multiple studies [41].
In contrast, several germline polymorphic variants in
ABC transporter genes which may influence EGFR-TKI
pharmacokinetics have not carried the same effect [42].
To assess the impact of the deletion in the Korean
population, we combined individual patient data from two
Korean studies [25, 30], as well as an additional cohort
(n = 18) from another Korean center [37]. The lack of
effect of the deletion in the Korean studies could account
for some of the statistical heterogeneity seen in our

responses, and may also include Korean-specific single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BIM itself that
counter the effects of the BIM deletion. Of relevance to
this discussion, functional polymorphisms in BIM besides
the deletion polymorphism have been reported in other
populations [43, 44]. It is also possible that functional BIM
SNPs may exist at varying frequencies between different
East Asian populations, as has been reported for functional
SNPs affecting genes other than BIM [45].
Another factor we could not correct for despite the
availability of individual patient data is the frequency of
radiological imaging used to determine tumor response
or progression. In this instance, length time bias may be
introduced by differences in the frequency of imaging, and
can only be properly addressed through large prospective
studies employing imaging at regular and pre-defined
intervals [46].
In addition to kinase inhibitors, the effect
of the BIM deletion could potentially extend to
chemotherapeutics. This possibility is consistent
with the superior overall survival we observed in
non-Korean patients without the deletion (Figure 2F
and Table 4) since patients would very likely have
received chemotherapy during the course of their
disease. Importantly, this clinical finding is supported
by preclinical data demonstrating that sensitivity to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

taxanes and vinca alkaloids, which are commonly used
in the treatment of NSCLC patients, depends on BIM
expression [47, 48]. It would therefore be interesting in
future studies to examine the effect of the BIM deletion
on PFS on chemotherapy. If the BIM deletion did indeed
influence treatment outcomes beyond TKIs, genotyping
for the BIM deletion may be a recommendation for
any therapeutic strategy that depends on BIM function
for efficacy. Furthermore, a recent Japanese study has
highlighted a correlation between the BIM deletion and
relapse-free survival in patients with early-stage resected
lung cancer [49], suggesting possible implications of the
BIM deletion on adjuvant therapy in early-stage lung
cancer, where vinorelbine is widely used.
Knowledge about EGFR-TKI resistance has
evolved since the discovery of the BIM deletion and the
understanding that low frequency MET amplification
(< 5%) [50] and de novo T790M mutations (1–2%) [51]
contribute to a small percentage of intrinsic resistance.
These areas are not addressed in this meta-analysis
because presence of these resistance mechanisms in
individual patients is not routinely assessed in clinical
practice as yet. Nevertheless, apoptosis remains the final
common pathway by which inhibitors of MET or EGFR
work, hence assessment of the BIM deletion status in
populations where it is common remains relevant. Indeed,

ongoing clinical trials are currently testing the hypothesis
that combination therapy using EGFR TKIs and HDAC
inhibitors will restore TKI sensitivity to patients with the
BIM deletion polymorphism [23].
There is also preliminary evidence suggesting that
the impact of our results may extend beyond East Asian
populations. The BIM deletion has been reported to be

present in a South American population at a frequency of
15.3% [31]. Accordingly, the effect of the BIM deletion
among the South American population should also be
examined, particularly since the EGFR mutation rate
and therefore proportion of EGFR-TKI-responsive lung
cancers in South American populations is higher than
reported in European studies [52].

In conclusion, our analysis confirms that patients
with EGFR-mutant NSCLC harboring the BIM deletion
are at higher risk for reduced progression-free survival
compared to those without the deletion. In addition, the
association is strongest among Chinese and Japanese
individuals for whom the BIM deletion also predicts a
reduction in overall survival. Accordingly, testing for the
presence of the BIM deletion among patients of Chinese or
Japanese ancestry with EGFR-mutant NSCLC may have
prognostic utility. Finally, ongoing trials (clinicaltrials.gov/
ct2/show/NCT02151721) are testing the hypothesis that
combination therapy with HDAC inhibitors and EGFRTKIs will overcome inferior outcomes conferred by the
BIM deletion. If positive, such studies will support the use
of the BIM deletion as a biomarker for combination therapy.

Two authors (SXS and WTL) independently
screened the title and abstract of retrieved articles. Articles
were included if they met the following criteria: 1) study
design: prospective or retrospective cohort studies, 2)
population: patients with advanced stage (IIIA/B/IV) or
postoperative relapsed NSCLC and known BIM deletion
status, 3) intervention: EGFR-TKI monotherapy and 4)
primary outcome: PFS and/or OS. Meta-analyses, case
studies, reviews, commentary articles and replies were
excluded from the analysis. Studies that cleared the title
and abstract screening stages were selected for full-text
review. Disagreements were resolved by discussion
between the two reviewers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature search and data extraction

Quality and bias assessment

A bibliographic search with no language
restrictions was made on PubMed and Embase to identify
eligible studies. As the first paper to describe the BIM
polymorphism was published in 2012, the search was
restricted to papers published in or after 2012, up to
September 21, 2015. The search strategy was developed
by FJS, and was run using terms related to lung cancer
(“Lung Cancer” or “Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung”
or “Lung Neoplasms” or “Lung Adenocarcinoma” or
“EGFR lung cancer” or “EGFR mutant lung cancer”),

We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool to assess
the quality of the studies included (Supplementary
Table 5). The quality of the study was regarded as high if
all aspects were assessed favorably.
To minimize publication bias, and as suggested
by the Cochrane Handbook of Systemic Reviews of
Interventions [53], we have taken the following measures.
First, we performed a comprehensive search on PubMed
and Embase with no language restrictions, and used

Figure 3: Cumulative meta-analysis of published and unpublished data of the association between the BIM deletion
polymorphism and progression-free survival in EGFR-TKI-treated NSCLC patients. Estimates were adjusted for age, sex,

smoking history, stage, ECOG status, histology, EGFR mutation and line of treatment. Zhong J et al. was omitted from this figure as both
summary statistics and individual patient data (IPD) were not available. * indicates IPD was unavailable, † indicates summary HRs were

we did not find evidence that the effect of BIM deletion
on PFS was modulated by the type of TKI-sensitizing
EGFR mutation in a Cox regression model incorporating
type of EGFR mutation, BIM deletion and an interaction
term EGFR mutation x BIM deletion (P = 0.906), for
our analyses, we grouped the patients into those with
sensitizing mutations, and those without. EGFR phenotype
was defined as sensitizing if mutations in exon 18, 19 and
21 were present, and resistant if EGFR was wildtype or
contained non-synonymous mutations in exon 20.
Univariate HRs were calculated for the following
factors: age, gender, smoking history, stage of disease,
histology, EGFR phenotype (sensitizing or resistant), line
of treatment, ECOG status and BIM genotype. Owing to
the exploratory nature of the analysis, significant factors
(P < 0.2) were entered into a multivariate Cox regression
analysis using a forward stepwise selection method
and adjusted HRs and 95% CIs were obtained for the
association between the BIM deletion and PFS.
To make the most of the available evidence in the
absence of individual patient data for some of the studies,
an aggregate data meta-analysis was also carried out.
Adjusted HRs reported in the original papers were used
when available. For the remaining studies, adjusted
HRs for the BIM deletion were calculated using a
Cox proportional hazards model that incorporated the
following factors if significant (P < 0.2): age, gender,
smoking history, stage of disease, histology, EGFR
phenotype (sensitizing or resistant), line of treatment,
and ECOG status (Supplementary Tables 6 to 11). In
anticipation of heterogeneity in exposure and treatmentrelated variables, a random-effects model was employed
to calculate summary HRs and 95% CIs for PFS.

multiple synonyms of search terms. Secondly, and because
the research topic here is a highly specialized one with
only a small community of researchers in East Asia who
are known to each other, we were able to obtain data from
3 unpublished studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis.

Individual patient data collection
Following ethics approval by the SingHealth
Institutional Review Board (IRB), invitations to participate
in the meta-analysis were sent to all investigators of
the primary studies identified through the literature
search. Corresponding authors were responsible for their
individual IRB approvals. Each author was requested to
submit anonymized individual patient data in a Microsoft
Excel template which included the following fields: age
at diagnosis, gender and ethnicity of the patient, smoking
history, tumor stage at diagnosis, histology, BIM deletion
status, EGFR mutation, EGFR-TKI used, line of treatment,
ECOG status, date TKI was started/stopped, reason TKI
was stopped, PFS, date of diagnosis, date of last followup, date of death, and OS. Any inconsistencies that were
identified were resolved through email correspondence
with the respective corresponding authors.

Definition of outcomes
The primary outcome, PFS, was defined as the
length of time from the date TKI was started to either
the date TKI was stopped or date of tumor progression,
depending on availability of data. PFS data was considered
‘mature’ if treatment was stopped because of progression,
and ‘censored’ if TKI treatment was stopped due to sideeffects or was ongoing. The secondary outcome, OS,
was defined as the length of time from the date first-line
therapy (chemotherapy or TKI) was initiated for advanced
disease until death from any cause. OS data was censored
if the patient was still alive on the date of last follow-up.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses were carried out using SAS
Version 9.3 (SAS® Cary, NC, USA), SPSS Version 20
(IBM, NY, USA) and Review Manager (RevMan) Version
5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The
Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). Differences in baseline
characteristics of patients with and without the deletion,
or with and without Korean ethnicity, were assessed
using two-sample t-tests, Fisher’s exact test and Pearson
Chi-Square test where appropriate. Kaplan-Meier curves
for factors reported in the literature to have an impact
on survival were compared using the log-rank test. In
addition, to evaluate potential differences possibly arising
from including patients from different centers, survival
was assessed among countries, centers, and ethnicities. As
