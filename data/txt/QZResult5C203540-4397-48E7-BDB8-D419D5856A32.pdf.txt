BACKGROUND: Sequential treatment with azacitidine can induce re-expression of epigenetically silenced genes
through genomic DNA hypomethylation and reverse carboplatin resistance of epithelial ovarian cancer cells. A phase
1b-2a clinical trial of this sequential combination of azacitidine and carboplatin was initiated in patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS: Patients with pathologically confirmed intermediate-grade or high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer who developed disease progression within 6 months
(resistant disease, n ¼ 18 patients) or during a platinum-based therapy (refractory disease, n ¼ 12 patients) were eligible. All patients had measurable disease. RESULTS: Thirty patients received a total of 163 cycles of treatment. This
regimen produced 1 complete response, 3 partial responses (overall response rate [ORR], 13.8%), and 10 cases of stable disease among 29 evaluable patients. For those patients who achieved clinical benefits, the median duration of
the treatment was 7.5 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for all patients
were 3.7 months and 14 months, respectively. Patients with platinum-resistant disease achieved an ORR of 22%, with
a median PFS of 5.6 months and a median OS of 23 months. The predominant toxicities were fatigue and myelosuppression. Correlative studies indicated that DR4 methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes was decreased during
treatment in 3 of 4 objective responders (75%), but in only 5 of 13 nonresponders (38%). CONCLUSIONS: To the
authors’ knowledge, the results of the current study provide the first clinical evidence that a hypomethylating agent

DNA methylation have been observed in cancer cells3:
global hypomethylation across the genome and localized
hypermethylation at specific CpG islands within the gene
promoter regions of certain genes. Decreased methylation
resulting from global hypomethylation may permit the
expression of previously quiescent proto-oncogenes and
pro-metastatic genes and promote tumor progression.
Alternatively, an aberrant increase in methylation patterns
at previously unmethylated sites, such as the promoter
regions of tumor suppressor genes, may result in transcriptional silencing and an inability to control tumor development.4-8
Methylation microarray analyses of late-stage ovarian cancers identified 2 distinct groups based on tumor
methylation levels that appeared to have prognostic significance.9 Progression-free survival (PFS) after chemotherapy was found to be significantly shorter for patients with
higher levels of methylation (8 months) compared with
those with lower levels (12 months; P < .001), suggesting that a higher degree of CpG island methylation is
associated with early disease recurrence and/or chemotherapy resistance.
Azacitidine is a hypomethylating agent that has been
shown to induce the re-expression of hMLH1 in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines, leading to resensitization of treated cells to carboplatin.10 Studies with
clonogenic assays as well as human tumor xenografts have
shown that the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian
cancer cells with hypomethylating agents such as decitabine or azacitidine increases sensitivity to platinum compounds, including carboplatin and cisplatin, in addition
to other chemotherapeutic agents.11,12 Our preclinical
studies revealed that in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer
cells, sequential treatment with azacitidine followed by
carboplatin produced synergistic cytotoxicity. In addition,
azacitidine enhanced the sensitivity of platinum-resistant
ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin associated with a DR4mediated caspase 8-dependent apoptosis.13 In the current
trial, we assessed the safety and efficacy of a sequential regimen in which azacitidine has been used to reverse resistance to carboplatin in patients with platinum-resistant or
platinum-refractory epithelial ovarian cancer. The choice
of this design is based on the finding that platinum is the
most effective chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of
human epithelial ovarian cancer,14-17 on previous clinical
experience that reversal of epigenetic changes can overcome chemotherapy resistance in other tumor types,18,19
and on our own preclinical data with ovarian cancer cell
lines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patients were eligible to participate in this trial if they had
a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of intermediategrade or high-grade epithelial cancers of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum that were considered platinum
refractory (progressive disease [PD] while receiving or persistent disease after platinum-based therapy) or platinum
resistant (PD within 6 months of treatment with a platinum-based regimen). Patients were at least aged 18 years
and had measurable disease by imaging studies that had
progressed within 3 months of study entry. All participants had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2. Additional eligibility criteria
included adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count >1500/lL, hemoglobin >9.0 g/dL, and
platelet count >75,000/lL), renal function (serum creatinine <1.5 mg/dL or a calculated creatinine clearance of at
least 60 mL/minute), and hepatic function (serum total
bilirubin <2.0 mg/dL and alanine aminotransferase <3fold of the upper limit of normal). Patients were excluded
if they had advanced hepatic metastases that occupied
>75% of the hepatic parenchyma or if they had undergone high-dose chemotherapy for ovarian cancer.
Study Design
This study was a prospective, open-label, phase 1b-2a
clinical trial of a sequential regimen using azacitidine to
reverse resistance to carboplatin in patients with platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory epithelial ovarian
cancer. The study was conducted at The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) after
the approval by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). All
patients provided written informed consent before study
entry using forms approved by the IRB. This study
included a dose-escalation phase based on the classical ‘‘3
þ 3’’ design and an expansion phase at the recommended
phase 2 dosages. The primary goal of the current study
was to define the safety and clinical responses of this
regimen.
Treatment Plan
Treatment was administered on an outpatient basis at
MDACC. Patients received azacitidine at a dose of 75
mg/m2 subcutaneously daily for 5 days20 and carboplatin
at either an area under the curve (AUC) of 4 or an AUC
of 5 intravenously over 1 hour on Day 2 every 28 days.
Chemotherapeutic agents were reconstituted according to
the manufacturers’ manuals. All patients received

antiemetics according to best local practice. Patients with
evidence of response or those without PD after the first 8week treatment cycle were eligible to receive further treatment until prohibitive toxicity or PD developed.
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as a platelet count <20,000/lL, an absolute neutrophil count
<500/lL for >7 days, neutropenic fever, or a delay of >7
days in the initiation of the next cycle at 100% dosage
because of inadequate hematological parameters, as well
as any grade 3 or greater nonhematological toxicity other
than nausea, vomiting, or fatigue occurring during the
first cycle of treatment. Carboplatin dosage was calculated
using the Calvert formula ¼ AUC  (GFR [glomerular
filtration rate] þ 25), in which the GFR was calculated
by stable serum creatinine based on the Cockcroft-Gault
equation.21,22
Safety and Efficacy Evaluation
All patients underwent evaluation including complete
medical history, physical examination, and laboratory
tests. Radiographic imaging studies (helical computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging scan)
were obtained to assess measurable disease whereas serum
CA 125 was obtained to assess biochemical responses.
Before each treatment, laboratory assessment, physical examination, ECOG functional status, toxicities, and concomitant medications were documented. The severity of
adverse events was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).
Efficacy endpoints included response rate, PFS, and
overall survival (OS). All patients were observed until
June 2008, when this protocol was closed, or until death.
The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease
(SD), and PD were used to characterize tumor responses.
Tumor size was determined by the product of 2 perpendicular diameters of marker lesions applied at the widest
portion of the tumor. All the measurable lesions were evaluated every 2 cycles. Serum CA 125 levels were measured
at baseline and before each cycle. The CA 125 response
criteria of 50% (4 samples) and 75% (3 samples) reduction were used as a supplementary assessment of possible
antitumor activity. To be evaluable for treatment
response, a patient must have received at least 2 cycles of
treatment.
DNA Extraction and Methylation Analysis
Blood samples from patients were collected into ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) vials at that time of

Cancer

enrollment and before each cycle of treatment. Plasma
was separated by centrifugation and leukocytes were separated on Ficoll-Hypaque gradients and stored at 20 C
until analyzed.
DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from patients at different
time points before and after treatment using standard phenol-chloroform extraction. It should be noted that this
will represent DNA from lysed normal blood cells as well
as tumor cells.23 Methylation analysis was performed
using a methylation kit (EZ-96 gold; Zymo Research, Orange, Calif). MethPrimer software was used for the prediction of CpG island of DR4 (ACCESSION EF064713;
GI: 117606477) and the design of methylation-specific
primers. The sequence of primers for methylated DR4
promoter was forward, TTGGAGCGTAATGGTTTTATTTC; reverse, AATACCTATAATCCCAACCA
CTCG, and that for unmethylated DR4 promoter was
forward,
GTTGGAGTGTAATGGTTTTATTTTG;
reverse, AATACCTATAATCCCAACC ACTCAA. The
methylation-specific (MSP) polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) conditions were 94 C for 5 minutes with hot start,
then 94 C for 30 seconds, 58 C or 60 C for 30 seconds,
and 72 C for 1 minute repeated for 40 cycles. Universal
methylated and unmethylated control DNAs were used
for the positive control (Chemicon International, Temecula, Calif). All MSP PCRs were repeated twice separately. Methylated DR4 was normalized by both
unmethylated DR4 and b-actin. Image analysis (Scion
Image for Windows, Frederick, Md) was used for semiquantitative measurement of methylated and unmethylated DR4. We defined at least 10% of DR4 methylation
changes as a cutoff value.
The hMLH1 methylation status in plasma DNA
was determined by MSP PCR using a CPGWIZ hMLH1
amplification kit (Chemicon International) based on the
manufacture’s instructions.
Statistical Analysis
This study was divided into 2 parts: dose escalation was
based on the standard 3 þ 3 design and dose expansion
was based on the Simon optimal 2-stage designs to enroll
27 patients assuming a p0 of 20%, a p1 of 35%, an a of
.1, and a b of .1. Descriptive summary statistics were
described as estimated proportions with 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs). Continuous variables not meeting
the assumptions of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) as well
as nonparametric data were compared using the Fisher
exact test. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population was

1663

Original Article

defined as all patients who were enrolled and received at
least 1 partial dose of therapy, whereas the evaluable population was defined as patients who completed at least 2
cycles of therapy. WHO criteria for efficacy were used to
estimate the overall response rate (ORR; CR þ PR). All
efficacy and safety analyses were conducted on an ITT basis. PFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method and log-rank test. PFS was defined as the interval
from the first day of treatment with the study drug until
documented PD or death due to any cause while the
patient was on study or during the long-term follow-up
period. OS was defined as the time period from the first
day of treatment with the study drug until death. The
association between the DR4 methylation in responders
and nonresponders was analyzed using the chi-square test.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 30 patients (median age, 63 years; range, 37-73
years) who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were
recruited onto this study. Among these patients, 7 patients
were enrolled during the dose escalation phase (with 1
early withdrawal) and 23 patients were enrolled during
the expansion phase. Twenty-nine patients had received
2 cycles of therapy, whereas 1 patient voluntarily withdrew from the study during dose escalation and was
replaced. She was evaluable for toxicity because she completed 1 cycle of therapy. The characteristics of these
patients are listed in Table 1. It was noted that 18 patients
had platinum-resistant and 12 had platinum-refractory
ovarian cancer. Twenty patients had received 3 types of
systemic chemotherapy.
Antitumor Activity
Of 29 evaluable patients who received 2 cycles of treatment, 11 received 6 cycles of treatment and 6 patients
received 10 cycles of treatment. One patient discontinued treatment because of intermittent rectal bleeding
caused by tumor necrosis after having completed 21
cycles. The ORR was 13.8% (4 of 29 patients; 95% CI,
10.1%-17.5%): 1 patient achieved a clinical CR, 3
patients achieved a clinical PR, and 10 patients had SD as
shown in Table 2. For those patients who achieved clinical
benefits, the median duration of the treatment was 7.5
months. The median PFS was 3.7 months, whereas the
median OS was 14 months (Fig. 1). Among 27 patients
who were eligible for CA 125 response evaluation, 5
patients achieved a CR, 6 patients achieved a PR, and 10
patients had SD. Although not preplanned, subgroup

analyses revealed that patients with platinum-resistant disease achieved an ORR of 22%, a median PFS of 5.6
months, and a median OS of 23 months, whereas patients
with platinum-refractory disease achieved an ORR of 0%,
a median PFS of 1.9 months, and a median OS of 10
months.
Toxicity
All 30 patients were evaluable for toxicity. No DLTs or
treatment-related deaths were observed. The most common adverse events included fatigue and myelosuppression. Grade 2 or higher toxicities are summarized in Table
3. Side effects included neutropenia, anemia, fatigue, nausea, and pain/irritation at the injection sites. No greater
toxicities were observed with sequentially administered
azacitidine and carboplatin than would be expected from
single-agent carboplatin based on historical experiences in
a similar cohort of patients.

PCR of DNA extracted from PBMC sampled from
patients before and after carboplatin and azacitidine treatment or plasma DNA from patients before carboplatin
and azacitidine treatment. When the dynamic changes of
DR4 methylation in PBMC were analyzed in an objective
responder (Fig. 2), we found that DR4 methylation
decreased slightly during the first cycle, reached a nadir
during the second cycle by approximately 50%, and then
increased slightly after several cycles of treatment. In contrast, no difference in the hMLH1 methylation of plasma
DNA was observed between objective responders and
nonresponders (Fig. 3). In these heavily pretreated
patients, hMLH methylation was found in 11 patients
(Patients 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 20, 23, and 30) of 26
patients examined (42%), supporting the hypothesis that
chemotherapy increased hMLH1 methylation.23

DNA methylation compared with baseline levels as
detected by image analysis of methylated and unmethylated DR4 (Fig. 4). Only 5 of 13 nonresponders (38%)
demonstrated similar decreases in the DR4 methylation
levels, suggesting that DR4 hypomethylation is more frequently noted in patients who respond to azacitidine followed by carboplatin.

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study provides
the first clinical evidence that a hypomethylating agent
may be able to partially reverse platinum resistance in
patients with ovarian cancer. In addition, the current
study included several interesting observations. First, several cycles of sequential therapy were required to reverse
carboplatin resistance, which was supported by our observation that patients with platinum-refractory epithelial

ovarian cancer achieved no clinical response and were
removed from the study after 2 cycles of treatment for
PD. Second, patients who achieved a clinical benefit displayed mixed responses, suggesting tumor and response
heterogeneity to the hypomethylating agent. The third
observation is that hepatic metastases generally failed to
respond to this sequential regimen, which might be
caused by hepatic inactivation of azacitidine. Finally, no
additional chemotherapy-related toxicities were observed
in this small cohort of patients, indicating that the low
dose of azacitidine that was sufficient to induce target
hypomethylation did not augment the toxicity profile of
chemotherapeutic agents when used in combination.

Platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory epithelial
ovarian cancer was chosen as a model for the following 4
reasons: advanced epithelial ovarian cancer displays multiple hypermethylation phenotypes involving known tumor
suppressor genes; carboplatin has significant efficacy in
treating ovarian cancer, although single-agent carboplatin
induces minimal to no clinical response in patients with
recurrent platinum-resistant and platinum-refractory
ovarian cancer; and pretreatment with hypomethylating
agents is able to reverse platinum resistance in platinumresistant epithelial ovarian cancer cell models.24-28
The first retrospective study conducted at MDACC
revealed that carboplatin retreatment resulted in a 21%
PR rate in 33 patients with platinum-resistant epithelial
ovarian cancer (79% had a platinum-free interval of at
least 12 months and 2 patients were potentially sensitive
to platinum). No patients with a platinum-free interval
<12 months achieved an objective response.29 It is interesting to note that a recent retrospective study at the same
center identified 34 similar patients who received carboplatin retreatment. The median platinum-free interval
from the time platinum was last received to retreatment

1667

Original Article

with carboplatin was 15.2 months. Only 2 patients
achieved a PR (5.9%) whereas 21 patients achieved SD
(61.7%).30 Another retrospective study from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center identified 30 platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients with a median
platinum-free interval of 16.2 months from July 1997
through June 2001. At the time of platinum retreatment,
20 patients received single-agent platinum and 10
received platinum combinations with newer agents. Only
2 of 21 patients achieved a PR (9.5%) based on Response
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) by CT
scans.31 Moreover, in a phase 1 trial of bortezomib and
carboplatin in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian
cancer, 8 of 18 patients achieved SD, whereas 10 patients
had PD.32 Taken together, these data suggest that retreatment with carboplatin induces a very small percentage of
objective responses (<10%). In the current study, treatment with azacitidine and carboplatin achieved an ORR
of 22% based on the WHO criteria in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, whereas no objective
responses were observed in patients with platinum-refractory ovarian cancer. It was noted that 2 of 4 responders
had a platinum-free interval of <12 months.
The pathogenesis of ovarian carcinoma is poorly
defined partly because of the lack of a tumor progression
model as well as heterogeneous histological types.33,34
Gene expression profiling of malignant ovarian cancer
demonstrated that a significant number of hypermethylated
genes were down-regulated.35 A novel microarray system to
assess gene expression, DNA methylation and histone acetylation in parallel, and to dissect the complex hierarchy of
epigenetic changes has been developed using human ovarian
cancer cell lines.36 Aberrant CpG island methylation was
found to be a major pathway leading to the inactivation of
tumor suppressor genes and the development of cancer.37-39
Further studies revealed that changes in DNA methylation
were cumulative with PD.8,40
It is important to note that agents inducing hypomethylation do not benefit all patients with ovarian cancer.
Therefore, the additional identification of predictive and
surrogate biomarkers is needed for better management of
this disease. Given our previous in vitro data that azacitidine enhanced the sensitivity of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells to carboplatin through reactivation of
DR4 and induction of caspase 8-mediated apoptosis,13
we tested whether a similar mechanism might exist in a
patient population. Although the number of patients
studied was small and differences did not achieve statistical significance, combining azacitidine with carboplatin

was found to decrease DR4 methylation more frequently
in patients who responded to this treatment than in those
who did not, which is consistent with the possibility that
reactivating silenced genes may be required for response.
The basal methylation levels of the DR4 and hMLH1
gene promoters do not appear to be critical for predicting
the response to this treatment strategy.27,41
The results of the current study suggest that a hypomethylating agent may enhance the response to platinum
in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The
impact of epigenetic therapy might be further enhanced
by the concomitant or sequential use of a hypomethylating agent and a histone deacetylase inhibitor before platinum treatment. Alternatively, it may be possible to
maximize the therapeutic potential of epigenetic treatments through prolonged exposure to epigenetic agents,
while concurrently administering a series of chemotherapeutic or biological agents.24 Additional larger studies of
the combination of azacitidine and carboplatin in patients
with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer are warranted.
