Abstract
Sarcomas are rare malignant mesenchymal tumors for which
there are limited treatment options. One potential molecular
target for sarcoma treatment is the Src tyrosine kinase.
Dasatinib (BMS-354825), a small-molecule inhibitor of Src
kinase activity, is a promising cancer therapeutic agent with
p.o. bioavailability. Dasatinib exhibits antitumor effects in
cultured human cell lines derived from epithelial tumors,
including prostate and lung carcinomas. However, the action
of dasatinib in mesenchymally derived tumors has yet to be
shown. Based on our previous findings of Src activation in
human sarcomas, we evaluated the effects of dasatinib in 12
cultured human sarcoma cell lines derived from bone and
soft tissue sarcomas. Dasatinib inhibited Src kinase activity
at nanomolar concentrations in these sarcoma cell lines.
Downstream components of Src signaling, including focal
adhesion kinase and Crk-associated substrate (p130CAS), were
also inhibited at similar concentrations. This inhibition of Src
signaling was accompanied by blockade of cell migration and
invasion. Moreover, apoptosis was induced in the osteosarcoma and Ewing’s subset of bone sarcomas at nanomolar
concentrations of dasatinib. Inhibition of Src protein expression by small interfering RNA also induced apoptosis,
indicating that these bone sarcoma cell lines are dependent
on Src activity for survival. These results show that dasatinib
inhibits migration and invasion of diverse sarcoma cell types
and selectively blocks the survival of bone sarcoma cells.
Therefore, dasatinib may provide therapeutic benefit by
preventing the growth and metastasis of sarcomas in patients.

Introduction
Sarcomas comprise a relatively rare and diverse group of
malignant tumors that arise from mesenchymal tissues, including
bone, fat, and muscle. There are more than 50 different subtypes of
sarcomas, with f11,000 new cases diagnosed nationwide each
year (1, 2). Although this represents a small fraction of all cancers

diagnosed in the United States,8 sarcomas account for f20% of
newly diagnosed pediatric solid tumor malignancies9 and are
among the cancers that pose the greatest risks of mortality and
morbidity in children and young adults (3–6).
Histologically, sarcomas are divided into two main subgroups:
soft tissue sarcomas and bone sarcomas (1). Genetically, sarcomas
also fall into two subgroups: those with complex karyotypes
characteristic of severe genomic instability and those with simple
karyotypes that are near diploid. The documented defects of
sarcomas with simple karyotypes usually include chromosomal
translocations, such as those involving ETS family genes. Sarcomas
with complex karyotypes have high frequencies of p53 and RB
mutations as well as impairments in DNA repair and show
chromosomal abnormalities. This latter group of sarcomas
includes many of the more commonly diagnosed sarcomas.
Sarcomas that fall into both histologic and genetic subgroups also
frequently possess abnormalities in growth factor receptor
signaling pathways. Protein tyrosine kinases make up the majority
of defective signaling pathways in sarcomas, including plateletderived growth factor receptor, c-KIT, c-MET, and insulin-like
growth factor-I receptor (1).
A common point of signal convergence downstream of many of
the defective receptor tyrosine kinase pathways in sarcomas is Src
kinase. Notably, Src is the oncoprotein encoded in the first solid
tumor virus to be reported, Rous sarcoma virus, which induces
sarcomas in chickens (7–9). The cellular counterpart of viral Src,
denoted as c-Src, was the first proto-oncogene to be identified
(10–13). As one of nine members of the Src family kinases (SFK),
Src was also the first protein tyrosine kinase to be described (7, 14).
Src kinase is regulated by growth factors, cytokines, cell adhesion,
and antigen receptor activation (15, 16) and is involved in controlling a myriad of fundamental cellular processes, including cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and survival (15). Among other
critical cellular substrates, Src kinase phosphorylates and thereby
activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK; refs. 17, 18). Significantly,
overexpression and/or activation of Src and FAK correlate with
cancer development and progression (19–21).

Dasatinib Inhibits Human Sarcoma Cells

Dasatinib was originally selected as a Src kinase inhibitor and
then shown to inhibit Bcr-Abl as well as other tyrosine kinases.
There have been several studies showing the activity of dasatinib
against Bcr-Abl–positive leukemic cell lines as well as epithelial
tumor cell lines (22–27). In addition, early-phase clinical trials have
established the safety and efficacy of dasatinib for treatment of
imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However,
the responses and mechanisms of action of dasatinib in mesenchymally derived tumor cell lines have not been described
previously. We report that dasatinib inhibits Src and downstream
FAK signaling at nanomolar concentrations, blocks cell migration
and invasion in many diverse human sarcoma cell lines, and
induces apoptosis in the bone sarcoma subgroup. Furthermore,
knockdown of Src expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in
bone sarcoma cells also induces apoptosis, suggesting that the
observed response to dasatinib in these cells is conveyed through
inhibition of Src-mediated signaling. Together, these findings
indicate that dasatinib is a promising therapeutic agent for
preventing growth and metastasis of a wide diversity of soft tissue
and bone sarcomas.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents. SaOS-2, U-2 OS, MG-63, SK-ES-1, A673, RD, SK-LMS-1,
and HT-1080 sarcoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The LM2 and LM7 osteosarcoma cell
lines were provided by Dr. Eugenie S. Kleinerman (M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center, Houston, TX). The TC-71 Ewing’s sarcoma cell line was provided by
Dr. Timothy Triche (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA).
The SaOS-2, MG-63, LM2, LM7, TC-71, SK-LMS-1, and HT-1080 cell lines
were maintained in MEM supplemented with Eagle’s salts, 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 2-fold MEM vitamins, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 1 mmol/L
nonessential amino acids, and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. The SK-ES-1 and U-2
OS cell lines were maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with
10% FBS. The A673 cell line was maintained in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS. The RD and RD18 cell lines were maintained in DMEM/F12 (1:1)
supplemented with 10% FBS. All cells were maintained at 37jC in 5% CO2.
All experiments were done using exponentially proliferating cells unless
otherwise noted.
Polyclonal antibodies to phosphorylated Src (Y419), phosphorylated FAK
(Y576/Y577), phosphorylated p130CAS (Y410), and total FAK and poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) proteins were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology (Cambridge, MA). Polyclonal antibodies to p130CAS and h-actin
were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies to total Src (clone GD11) and hILP/XIAP were obtained
from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and BD Biosciences
(San Diego, CA), respectively. Dasatinib was provided by Bristol-Myers
Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Princeton, NJ). Dasatinib was
synthesized by the addition of methylpyrimidine to the 2-amino group of
thiazole followed by a reaction with hydroxyethyl piperazine (28).
Preparation of cell extracts and Western blotting. Adherent sarcoma
cells were washed with ice-cold 1 PBS followed by washing and scraping
from plates in ice-cold 1 PBS containing 5 mmol/L sodium fluoride
and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate (1 PBS + inhibitors). Cells were
harvested by centrifugation, washed with 1 PBS + inhibitors, and
harvested again by centrifugation. Pellets were resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, NaF,
DTT, and 1:100-fold dilution of protease inhibitor cocktail obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Samples were vortexed for 30 min at 4jC,
and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. For Western blotting,
50 Ag protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Blots were blocked in 1 TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 and
5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibody in
1 TBS containing 0.01% Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich overnight at 4jC with rocking. Protein-bound primary

antibodies were detected using respective horseradish peroxidase–coupled
secondary antibodies (Amersham anti-rabbit for polyclonal and anti-mouse
for monoclonal, obtained from GE Healthcare Unlimited, Buckinghamshire,
United Kingdom) diluted 1:10,000 in 1 TBS containing 0.01% Tween
20 and 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.
Bound secondary antibodies were detected using Amersham ECL Plus
Western blotting detection reagents obtained from GE Healthcare
Unlimited. Densitometry was done on phosphorylated Src (Y419) Western
blots done for dose responses in each of the cell lines and then analyzed
using ImageQuant 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) software.
Percentage inhibition of Src kinase activity as measured by Src (Y419)
phosphorylation was determined by nonlinear regression analyses, and data
were reported as the inhibitory concentration required to achieve 50%
inhibition relative to control reactions (IC50) in Table 1. Data are the
averages of triplicate determinations.
Immunohistochemistry. Human tissues were obtained through the
Moffitt Cancer Center Tumor Bank using Institutional Review Board–
approved protocols. Tissues were fixed in formalin within 15 to 20 min
from the moment of surgical excision to preserve the phosphorylation
status of proteins, such as Src. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections of 3-Am thickness were deparaffinized by an initial warming to
60jC followed by two xylene changes of 10 min each, two series of 30 dips
in absolute alcohol, 30 dips in 95% alcohol, and 20 dips in deionized water.
Slides were placed for 5 min in TBS/Tween 20 and processed on a DAKO
Autostainer using the DAKO LSAB+ peroxidase detection kit (DAKO,
Carpinteria, CA). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% aqueous
hydrogen peroxide followed by 20 dips in deionized water. The anti–
phosphorylated Src (Y419) was applied at 1:100 dilution for 30 min after
microwave antigen retrieval with 0.1 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0; Emerson
1,100 W microwave, high to boiling, then 20 min on power level 5). The
chromogen 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine was used for detection. Counterstain
was done with modified Mayer’s hematoxylin. Slides were dehydrated
through graded alcohol, cleared with xylene, and mounted with resinous
mounting medium.
Wound-healing assay for cell migration. Cells were plated in 24-well
tissue culture plates, grown to confluency, and serum starved in 0.1% FBS
overnight. Monolayer wounds were produced using a pipette tip scratched
through the center of the well. Photomicrographs were taken of the initial
wound for comparison. Cells were then treated with either DMSO alone as
vehicle control or escalating doses of dasatinib and allowed to migrate into
the denuded areas for 24 h. Following incubation, cells were briefly stained
with Coomassie blue. Cell migration was visualized at 10 magnification
and digitally photographed. The distance of migration was measured as
pixel units and compared with time 0. The average number of pixel units
measured in the denuded area was determined from wound-healing assays
for dose responses in each of the cell lines analyzed. Percentage inhibition
of migration was determined by nonlinear regression analyses, and data
were reported as the inhibitory concentration required to achieve 50%
inhibition relative to control reactions (IC50). Data are the averages of
triplicate determinations.
Cell invasion assay. Cell invasion assays were done following the
BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers protocol obtained from BD Biosciences (Bedford, MA). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and washed once with
1 PBS and twice using serum-free medium. Cell suspensions were
prepared at 5  104 cells/mL in 0.5 mL containing DMSO alone as vehicle
control or escalating doses of dasatinib in serum-free medium and added to
the chamber insert. Chambers were incubated for 22 h at 37jC and 5% CO2.
Following incubation, noninvading cells were removed using a cottontipped swab. The cells that invaded to the lower surface of the membrane
were stained using a Diff-Quick Staining kit from Fisher Scientific
(Pittsburgh, PA), digitally photographed, and counted. Each experiment
was completed in triplicate.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling assay. Apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the In
Situ Cell Death Detection kit obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals
(Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were

NOTE: Summary of responses to dasatinib in human sarcoma cell lines. With the exception of one soft tissue sarcoma cell line (HT-1080), all of the cell
lines examined respond to dasatinib by inhibition of Src phosphorylation on Y419 and migration at IC50 values consistent with Src kinase inhibition. A
subset of bone sarcoma cell lines responds to dasatinib treatment by induction of apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis was not observed in the soft tissue
sarcoma cell lines and in one osteosarcoma (MG-63) cell line. +/ depicts relative phosphorylated Src (Y419) expression.

dasatinib for 48 h.
siRNA transfections. siRNA directed specifically against c-Src and a
nontargeting siRNA control were obtained from Dharmacon RNA
Technologies (Chicago, IL). Cells were plated on 6-cm tissue culture plates
in complete medium (5  105 per plate) and allowed to attach overnight.
siRNA was transfected in escalating doses (50 and 100 nmol/L) using
Oligofectamine obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The transfection incubation
time for the siRNA/Oligofectamine complexes was 24 h, and total incubation time before harvesting cell lysates was 72 h.
Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics, such as mean values and SD,
were calculated for the biological effects of dasatinib on invasion by dose
levels (nmol/L). To determine statistical significance between pairwise dose
levels, the exact Wilcoxon two-sample test was used, considering the small

sample sizes. One-sided tests at a significance level of 0.05 were examined.
All data were analyzed using the Statistical Analysis System software version
9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Results
Src kinase is activated in human sarcomas and sarcoma cell
lines. Immunohistochemistry was done on human sarcoma
specimens for activated Src protein using antibodies to phosphorylated Src. Levels of phosphorylated Src on tyrosine residue 419
(Y419) due to autophosphorylation reflect Src kinase activities in
intact cells and tissues. Results show activated Src in sarcomas
of diverse subtypes (Fig. 1), including leiomyosarcoma (Fig. 1A),

Dasatinib Inhibits Human Sarcoma Cells

Figure 2. Dasatinib inhibits Src activation and downstream signaling in whole cells. A and B, SaOS-2 and U-2 OS cells were treated with dasatinib in a dose-dependent
manner for 6 h. Cell-free extracts were immunoblotted with antibodies specific to phosphorylated Src (Y419) and total Src. C, U-2 OS cells were treated with
100 nmol/L dasatinib in a time-dependent manner. Western blot analysis was done as described. DMSO was used as a vehicle control, and h-actin was immunoblotted
for as a loading control in all experiments. D, dasatinib specifically blocks tyrosyl phosphorylation of FAK (Y576/Y577 and Y925) and p130CAS (Y410) but not FAK
(Y397). SaOS-2 cells were treated with dasatinib for 6 h in a dose-dependent manner. Cell-free extracts were immunoblotted with antibodies specific to phosphorylated
FAK (Y397, Y576/Y577, and Y925; p-FAK ), total FAK, p130CAS, and phosphorylated p130CAS (Y410; p-p130CAS ).

high-grade osteosarcoma (Fig. 1B), and liposarcoma (Fig. 1C).
Because autophosphorylated Src was found in a majority of the
human sarcomas examined, including diverse soft tissue and bone
sarcomas (data not shown), we determined the level of Src
activation in a panel of human sarcoma cell lines by Western blot
analysis for phosphorylated Src (Y419) and total Src protein levels.
Src was detectably activated in all but one (HT-1080) of the cell
lines examined, albeit to different extents (Fig. 1D). Total Src
protein expression does not correlate with levels of phosphorylated
Src in every case, indicative of different levels of Src kinase
activation among the sarcoma cell lines. In addition, the level to
which Src kinase is activated (phosphorylated Src levels) does not
correlate with specific sarcoma histologic subtypes (Fig. 1; Table 1).
Dasatinib inhibits Src kinase activity in human sarcoma cell
lines. Dasatinib has previously been shown to directly inhibit
the kinase activity of purified Src protein in vitro with an IC50 of
3 nmol/L (24). To evaluate the effect of dasatinib on Src kinase
activity in intact sarcoma cells, we treated the above cell lines with
escalating doses of dasatinib (30, 100, 300, and 1,000 nmol/L) for
6 h and Western blot analysis was done to evaluate phosphorylated
Src levels. Dose-response results for the two representative cell
lines (SaOS-2 and U-2 OS) are shown in Fig. 2A and B. The IC50
values for inhibition of phosphorylated Src by dasatinib range from
3 to 68 nmol/L for all cell lines analyzed (summarized in Table 1).
Time course experiments were done to determine the kinetics at
which Src phosphorylation is inhibited by dasatinib. As shown in

www.aacrjournals.org

representative results with U-2 OS cells, inhibition of Src
phosphorylation is complete by 15 min following treatment with
100 nmol/L dasatinib and persists for at least 24 h (Fig. 2C).
Interestingly, total Src protein expression was increased in a doseand time-dependent manner in a subset of the cell lines treated
with dasatinib. In particular, all but one bone sarcoma cell line
(MG-63) produced increases in total Src protein expression, yet
this effect was not observed in the soft tissue sarcoma cell
lines (Fig. 2A–C; data not shown). These data suggest a positive
feedback mechanism for compensation of Src kinase inhibition
with increased levels of Src protein expression in the bone sarcoma
cells.
Dasatinib selectively blocks Src downstream signaling. Src
kinase has been shown to regulate cellular activities through
several downstream signaling pathways. One such pathway is FAK,
which is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that has been found to be
increased in a variety of epithelial cancers, including prostate,
cervical, and colon carcinomas (29–32). Furthermore, increased
FAK expression is associated with tumor progression in a mouse
model of skin carcinogenesis (33). FAK, in turn, has been implicated in the activation of Crk-associated substrate, p130CAS, which,
together with Src and FAK, plays a vital role in cell adhesion,
migration, proliferation, and survival (34). To investigate the effect
of dasatinib on these Src downstream signaling pathways, sarcoma
cell lines were treated in culture with escalating doses of dasatinib
for 6 h. As representative results using SaOS-2 cells, Fig. 2D shows

Western blot analysis done using antibodies to total FAK
protein, phosphorylated FAK (Y397, Y576/Y577, and Y925),
p130CAS, and phosphorylated p130CAS (Y410). The IC50 values for
inhibition of phosphorylated FAK (Y576/Y577 and Y925) and
p130CAS were between 30 and 100 nmol/L, consistent with the IC50
values for inhibition of Src kinase activity in these cells (Fig. 2;
Table 1). FAK autophosphorylation (Y397) was not substantially
inhibited until higher doses of dasatinib (1,000 nmol/L), indicating
that dasatinib does not directly inhibit FAK kinase activity.
Surprisingly, total p130CAS protein was diminished with dasatinib
treatment, whereas total FAK protein was not affected (Fig. 2D),

suggesting that p130CAS protein is subject to negative feedback
regulation in these cells. By contrast, dasatinib did not inhibit
signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)
signaling in sarcoma cell lines (data not shown), another signaling
pathway that has been shown to act downstream of Src in cells of
other tumor types (35). Thus, dasatinib selectively blocks FAK and
p130CAS signaling downstream of Src in sarcoma cell lines.
Dasatinib blocks cell motility and invasion by sarcoma cells.
Both FAK and p130CAS activities are involved in regulating cell
migration and invasion downstream of Src kinase. The effect of
dasatinib on cell migration was evaluated using ‘‘wound-healing’’

Figure 3. Dasatinib inhibits cell motility
and invasion. A, wound-healing assays
were done to determine the effects of
dasatinib on inhibiting cell migration.
SaOS-2 cells were plated in 12-well tissue
culture plates, grown to confluency, and
serum starved overnight in medium
containing 0.1% FBS. Wounds were
introduced on cell monolayers using a
pipette tip. Cells were washed with
1 PBS to remove nonadherent cells and
treated with DMSO or dasatinib in a
dose-dependent manner for 24 h. Cell
migration was visualized at 10
magnification by light microscopy and
photographed with a digital camera.
B, width of voided area versus dasatinib
dose concentration was graphed to
express the degree of inhibition of cell
migration. The number of pixels within the
denuded area was the units used to show
inhibition of cell migration induced by
dasatinib. *, P < 0.001; n = 3. C, Matrigel
invasion chambers were used to measure
dasatinib inhibition of cellular invasion.
SaOS-2 (black columns ) and U-2 OS
(gray columns ) were treated with dasatinib
in a dose-dependent manner. Cells were
diluted in 500 AL of serum-free medium
and placed over the inner chamber of the
insert in a 24-well tissue culture plate, and
500 AL of complete medium were placed in
the lower chamber of the insert. After
incubating for 22 h, cells that invaded
through the Matrigel were stained,
visualized using light microscopy,
photographed, and counted. Each
experiment was done in triplicate. The
mean values of invasive cells were
graphed versus dasatinib concentration.

dose-dependent manner with dasatinib
for 24 h. Greater than 90% of the cells
were viable after dasatinib treatment
(data not shown).

Figure 4. Dasatinib induces apoptosis in bone sarcoma cell lines. A and C, dasatinib induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. SaOS-2 and U-2 OS cells
were treated with dasatinib for 72 h with escalating doses. Cell-free extracts were immunoblotted with antibodies specific to XIAP and PARP. B, SaOS-2 cells were
treated with 100 nmol/L dasatinib in a time-dependent manner and immunoblotted with an antibody specific for PARP. D, apoptosis was further verified by TUNEL
assay as described. SaOS-2 cells were plated in 12-well tissue culture plates and treated with dasatinib for 48 h in a dose-dependent manner. After completing
the TUNEL assay, cells were visualized using light microscopy and photographed at 20 magnification.

assays (by scratching cell monolayers with a pipette tip) and
treating with drug. Cells were plated in 0.1% serum medium before
inducing the wound to ensure that migration rather than cell
growth was measured. The width of the wound was determined at
T 0, and then, cells were treated with escalating doses of dasatinib
in 0.1% serum medium for 24 h. Representative results are shown
with the SaOS-2 cells, which were digitally photographed, and the
width of denuded area in the wound was measured in pixels
(Fig. 3A and B). Wound healing was dramatically inhibited by
dasatinib in a dose-dependent manner, with detectable inhibition
at 30 nmol/L dasatinib and substantial inhibition at 100 nmol/L
dasatinib. To evaluate the effect of dasatinib on cell invasion,
SaOS-2 and U-2 OS cells were treated with dasatinib in a doseresponse manner for 22 h in Matrigel invasion chambers. Dasatinib
significantly inhibited cellular invasion in both cell lines (Fig. 3C).
The SaOS-2 cell line was more sensitive to inhibition of invasion by
dasatinib compared with the U-2 OS cell line. The IC50 values for
inhibition of tumor cell invasion in this assay ranged from 30 to
100 nmol/L. These IC50 values for blockade of cell migration and
invasion are consistent with the IC50 values for inhibition of Src
kinase as well as downstream FAK and p130CAS signaling (compare
with Table 1 and Fig. 2D).
Dasatinib induces apoptosis of bone sarcoma cell lines. To
determine the effect of dasatinib on sarcoma cell survival, we did
growth curve analyses in cell lines treated with increasing
concentrations of dasatinib. These assays suggested that the subset
of cell lines derived from bone sarcomas responded to dasatinib by

induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (data not
shown). To further validate the induction of apoptosis in this
subset of cell lines, Western blot analysis was done for apoptotic
markers. SaOS-2 and U-2 OS cells were treated with escalating
doses of dasatinib for 72 h, and PARP cleavage and XIAP expression
were evaluated in both cell lines (Fig. 4A and C). PARP cleavage, an
indicator of apoptosis, is evident at 30 nmol/L dasatinib and
increased with escalating doses of dasatinib. Furthermore, expression of XIAP, an inhibitor of apoptosis, was diminished by dasatinib
treatment with IC50 values ranging from 30 to 100 nmol/L (Fig. 4A
and C). A time course analysis with 100 nmol/L dasatinib was done
in the SaOS-2 cell line to determine when apoptosis was induced
as measured by PARP cleavage. PARP cleavage is evident as early as
6 h following treatment with dasatinib and increased with time
(Fig. 4B). Moreover, TUNEL assays done on SaOS-2 cells confirmed
that increasing numbers of the cells were undergoing apoptosis by
48 h after treatment with escalating doses of dasatinib (Fig. 4D).
Therefore, dasatinib induces apoptosis in the bone sarcoma subset
with IC50 values corresponding to those of inhibition of Src kinase
and downstream signaling by dasatinib (Table 1).
Src is required for survival of bone sarcoma cell lines. To
determine if inhibition of Src kinase by dasatinib is sufficient to
induce apoptosis in the bone sarcoma cell lines, we transfected
these cell lines with siRNA to c-Src. Two representative bone
sarcoma cell lines, SaOS-2 and U-2 OS, underwent induction of
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as measured by PARP
cleavage in response to siRNA against c-Src but not to control

siRNA. Src protein expression was inhibited by transfection with
50 and 100 nmol/L of siRNA against c-Src, corresponding to
induction of PARP cleavage in both cell lines (Fig. 5A and B).
MG-63, an osteosarcoma cell line that does not undergo apoptosis
when treated with dasatinib, also does not undergo apoptosis when
transfected with siRNA to c-Src (data not shown). These data show
that a subset of the bone sarcoma cell lines relies on Src kinase for
survival, indicating that inhibition of Src kinase activity by
dasatinib is sufficient to induce apoptosis in these cells.

Discussion
After nearly a century since the discovery of the Rous sarcoma
virus, which subsequently was shown to induce sarcomas by
capturing and mutationally activating the cellular gene encoding
the Src tyrosine kinase, targeted Src kinase inhibitors are now
entering clinical trials for solid tumors. Sarcomas comprise a highly
diverse set of human tumors that frequently occur among pediatric
cancer patients and for which there are limited treatment options.
Based on our observation of Src kinase activation in sarcoma
clinical specimens, we sought to determine the action of dasatinib,
a potent and p.o. bioavailable inhibitor of Src kinase, on human
sarcoma cell lines.
Our findings show that dasatinib inhibits Src kinase activity, as
measured by autophosphorylation at Y419, in a dose-dependent
manner in sarcoma cells. Furthermore, in 11 of 12 sarcoma cell
lines examined, dasatinib inhibits cell migration and invasion. The
single cell line that did not respond to dasatinib (HT-1080) was also
the only one that lacked detectable Src kinase activity in this panel
(Table 1). Moreover, suppression of cell migration and invasion was
associated with inhibition of downstream Src signaling through
FAK and p130CAS, proteins known to be involved in mediating
these cellular processes (17, 36–38). The IC50 values for inhibition
of Src/FAK/p130CAS signaling as well as migration and invasion are
all in the range of approximately 30 to 100 nmol/L regardless of
histologic type (Table 1). Taken together, our findings suggest a
model for the mechanism of dasatinib action in which blockade of
Src and downstream signaling suppresses migration and invasion
of sarcoma cells (Fig. 5C).
Significantly, dasatinib induces apoptosis in the majority of bone
sarcoma cell lines, including osteosarcoma and Ewing’s sarcoma,
but not in any of the soft tissue sarcoma cell lines in our panel.
Genetic inhibition of Src using siRNA also induced apoptosis in
bone sarcoma cell lines that respond to dasatinib with apoptosis
but not in the only osteosarcoma cell line (MG-63) in which
dasatinib did not induce apoptosis. Thus, dasatinib induces
apoptosis in bone sarcoma cell lines dependent on Src kinase for
survival. A major Src signaling pathway involved in preventing
apoptosis in other cellular contexts is STAT3 (39, 40). Whereas
most of the sarcoma cell lines in this study harbor activated STAT3,
with the sole exception of SK-ES-1, dasatinib did not inhibit STAT3
activation, indicating that this pathway is not involved in the
dasatinib-mediated apoptosis response in sarcomas.10 On the other
hand, the IC50 values for induction of apoptosis by dasatinib are in
the same range required for blockade of FAK and p130CAS signaling
in these cell lines. Because FAK and p130CAS have been implicated

Figure 5. A and B, siRNA to c-Src induces apoptosis in bone sarcoma
cell lines. SaOS-2 (A ) and U-2 OS (B ) cells were plated in 6-cm tissue
culture plates, transfected with 50 and 100 nmol/L of siRNA to c-Src (si Src ),
and harvested after 72 h. Cell-free extracts were immunoblotted with
antibodies specific for Src and PARP to measure the efficiency of knockdown
by siRNA and to determine if apoptosis was induced on depletion of Src
protein expression. C, Src activation and signaling are inhibited by dasatinib.
Inhibition of Src signaling by dasatinib prevents cellular migration and
invasion in sarcoma cell lines. On inhibition of Src phosphorylation or c-Src
expression, a subset of bone sarcoma cell lines undergoes an induction
of apoptosis.

Dasatinib Inhibits Human Sarcoma Cells

in tumor cell survival, in addition to cell migration and invasion, it
is possible that these pathways are involved in dasatinib-mediated
apoptosis in sarcoma cells.
It is notable that levels of Src activation do not correlate with
IC50 values of dasatinib responses in terms of cell migration,
invasion, or apoptosis (Table 1). This finding may be explained by
the possibility that low levels of Src kinase activation are sufficient
to induce these biological properties. Alternative explanations are
the possibilities that other SFK members or unidentified targets are
involved in the responses to dasatinib. Similar results have been
observed for other molecular-targeted therapeutic agents, such as
Iressa, where clinical response to this epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) inhibitor is not correlated with levels of EGFR
expression or activation (27). In the specific case of Iressa, EGFR
mutations have been shown to influence response to Iressa;
however, mutations in the c-Src gene are extremely rare in human
cancers (41). Thus, selection of patients for dasatinib treatment
based on Src expression or activation levels may not predict the
optimal clinical responses. It remains to be determined whether
any of the known genetic subtypes of sarcomas are more sensitive
to dasatinib than others.
Earlier preclinical laboratory studies pointed to the promise of
dasatinib in the treatment of Gleevec-resistant CML, a prediction
that has been borne out in clinical trials (26, 42–47). Based on more

recent preclinical laboratory studies, several human solid tumor
sites have shown promise for clinical trials, including prostate,
lung, pancreatic, and head and neck cancers (23, 24, 27). We have
established that Src is activated in a wide variety of human
sarcoma clinical specimens, including soft tissue and bone
sarcomas. Furthermore, our data show that dasatinib inhibits Src
kinase and downstream signaling, leading to blockade of cell
migration and invasion of sarcoma cell lines of diverse origins. In
the subset of bone sarcomas, dasatinib also induces apoptosis.
Taken together, our results suggest that dasatinib will provide
clinical benefit to soft tissue and other sarcomas by preventing
metastasis, which may be further augmented in bone sarcomas by
induction of apoptosis.
