BACKGROUND: More reliable clinical outcome prediction is required to better guide more personalized treatment for patients with
primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The objective of this study was to identify a microRNA expression signature to improve outcome prediction for patients with primary GBM. METHODS: A cohort of Chinese patients with primary GBM (n ¼ 82) was analyzed
using whole-genome microRNA expression profiling with patients divided into a training set and a testing set. Cox regression and
risk-score analyses were used to develop a 5-microRNA signature using 41 training samples. The signature was validated in 41 other
test samples, in an independent cohort of 35 patients with GBM, and in the Cancer Genome Atlas data set. RESULTS: Patients who
had high risk scores according to the 5-microRNA signature had poor overall survival and progression-free survival compared with
patients who had low risk scores. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that the 5-microRNA signature was an independent prognostic
biomarker after adjusting for other clinicopathologic and genetic factors, such as extent of resection, temozolomide chemotherapy,
preoperative Karnofsky performance status score, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation, and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-microRNA signature was identified as an independent risk
predictor that identified patients who had a high risk of unfavorable outcome, demonstrating its potential for personalizing cancer
management. The authors concluded that this signature should be evaluated in further prospective studies. Cancer 2013;119:814-24.

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant brain tumor in the central nervous system. Primary GBM, which
accounts for >90% of glioblastomas, occurs de novo without any evidence of a less malignant precursor. The median survival of patients with primary GBM is approximately 1 year, but it varies remarkably from <1 week to >3 years after diagnosis,1 suggesting the limitations of the current clinicopathologic determinants of prognosis and in the choice of better
therapeutic strategies.
The introduction of molecular biomarkers in the management of patients with cancer may improve their clinical
outcomes. Many biomarker candidates have been generated by high-throughput technologies such, as microarray gene
expression profiling.2 Recent reports suggest that microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles be more effective for tumor
classification than protein-coding gene expression profiles.3-5 Several advantages have been demonstrated for miRNAs
over messenger RNAs (mRNAs) as biomarkers. It is predicted that the human genome has nearly 1000 miRNAs and
>40,000 protein-coding genes. Accordingly, genome-wide gene expression data are much more extensive than miRNA
expression data. Therefore, it is more workable to identify reliable miRNA biomarkers from genome-wide miRNA expression data than from genome-wide gene expression data. Furthermore, miRNAs are subjected relatively less to degradation
and, thus, are more applicable to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.

5-MicroRNA Signature and GBM Outcomes/Zhang et al

MicroRNAs are approximately 22-nucleotide long,
single-stranded, noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate the expression of hundreds of genes by translational repression or transcript degradation, thereby
modulating a variety of biologic functions.6 Several miRNAs reportedly have been associated with clinical outcomes in some cancers, such as chronic lymphocytic
leukemia,7 lung cancer,8 pancreatic cancer,9 and colon adenocarcinoma.10 However, whether an miRNA signature
is able to predict clinical outcomes in patients with primary GBM has not been reported in the Chinese population. Therefore, we performed miRNA expression
profiling in a cohort of 82 primary GBMs and identified a
5-miRNA prognostic signature, which was revalidated in
an independent cohort of 35 primary GBMs and in the
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Samples

In total, 117 eligible patients who had primary GBM histologically diagnosed according to the 2007 World
Health Organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system were included in this study (82
patients from Beijing Tiantan hospital [the Tiantan
cohort] and 35 patients from Jiangsu Provincial People’s
Hospital and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin
Medical University [the independent cohort]). The
patients underwent surgical resection and then received
radiation therapy and alkylating agent-based chemotherapy. Tumor tissues were obtained by surgical resection.
Five control brain tissue samples from areas surrounding
arteriovenous malformations were collected from Tiantan
Hospital.
The tissues were immediately snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen after resection. Hematoxylin and eosin staining
of tissue sections was conducted to assess the percentage of
tumor cells. Only samples that contained >80% tumor
cells were selected. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating hospitals, and
written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
The clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients are
listed in Table 1. The TCGA data set also was used to validate the miRNA signature.
MicroRNA Expression Profiling

Total RNA (tRNA) was extracted from frozen tissues by
using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Inc.,
Austin, Tex), and its concentration and quality were
determined with the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, Del).

P values were determined using a 2-sided chi-square test or a 1-way
analysis of variance.

The miRNA expression profiling was performed using
the human v2.0 miRNA Expression BeadChip (Illumina,
Inc., San Diego, Calif) with 1146 miRNAs covering 97%
of the miRBase 12.0 database according to the manufacturer’s instructions.11 All data were deposited in Chinese
Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA).

Pyrosequencing for Isocitrate Dehydrogenase
1 Mutation and O-6-Methylguanine-DNA
Methyltransferase Promoter Methylation

Pyrosequencing of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1)
mutation and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) promoter methylation was performed on a
PyroMark Q96 ID System (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). For
IDH1 mutation, the primers 50 -GCTTGTGAGTGGATGGGTAAAAC-30 and 50 -biotin-TTGCCAACATG
ACTTACTTGATC-30 were used for PCR amplification,
and the primer 50 -TGGATGGGTAAAACCT-30 was used
for pyrosequencing. For MGMT promoter methylation,
bisulfite modification of the DNA was performed using
the EpiTect Kit (Qiagen). The primers 50 -GTTTYGGAT
ATGTTGG GATA-30 and 50 -biotin-ACCCAAACACTC
ACCAAATC-30 were used for PCR, and the primer
50 -GGATATGTTGGGATAGT-30
was
used
for
pyrosequencing.
Statistical Analysis

Arrays were scanned with the Illumina BeadArray Reader,
and images were analyzed using Illumina BeadStudio software. Average values of replicate spots for each gene were
background subtracted, normalized against the total
expression from the chip, and subjected to further analysis. The microarray data set was deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) (accession number
GSE25632) according to ‘‘minimum information about a
microarray experiment’’ (MIAME) guidelines. Differences in clinicopathologic characteristics were evaluated by
using a chi-square test or a 1-way analysis of variance
among the training set, the testing set, and the independent cohort. The 82 patients with primary GBM in the
Tiantan cohort were assigned randomly to a training set
(n ¼ 41) and a testing set (n ¼ 41). In total, 1146 probe
sets (actually, 1145 probes were identified in the Illumina
BeadChip) were first filtered to select for a coefficient of
variation >0.2, allowing us to have most of the variations
in miRNA expression across the samples in the training
set. In this step, 311 probes were filtered out, and 834
probes remained. Then, permutation tests were performed to identify miRNAs that were associated significantly with overall survival (OS). The permuted P value
for each miRNA was corrected by multiple comparison
correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery
rate (FDR). The miRNAs with corrected permutation P
values < .01 were selected as the candidate miRNAs. In
this step, 825 probes were filtered out, and 9 probes (miR816

NAs) remained. Finally, 5 of the 9 remaining probes
(miRNAs) with fold changes >1.5 between GBM and
normal brain were identified as miRNAs that were associated significantly with survival. Protective or risky miRNAs were defined as those with hazard ratios for death <1
or >1.
To assess the miRNAs that were identified for survival prediction, a risk-score formula for predicting survival was developed based on a linear combination of the
miRNA expression level weighted by the regression coefficient derived from the univariate Cox regression analysis.12,13 The risk score for each patient was calculated as
follows: risk score ¼ (0.00281  expression level of miR181d) þ (0.00045  expression level of miR-518b) þ
(0.05976  expression level of miR-524-5p) þ (0.00079
 expression level of miR-566) þ (0.00472  expression
level of miR-1227). Patients with high risk scores are
expected to have poor survival.
According to the risk score (cutoff value, 2.29),
patients in the training set were stratified into a high-risk
group and a low-risk group. The risk-score threshold was
determined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
analysis with an area under the curve of 0.773. The same
threshold was applied to the testing set and the independent cohort. The differences in OS and progression-free
survival (PFS) between high-risk patients and low-risk
patients were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier
method and 2-sided log-rank tests. Cox proportional
hazards regression analyses were performed to assess the
independent contribution of the miRNA signature and
clinicopathologic variables to survival prediction.
By using the same method that was used for the
profiling data, we developed the risk score formula using
the RT-PCR data normalized against U6 rRNA. The risk
score was calculated as follows: risk score ¼ (14.692 
expression level of miR-181d) þ (3.434  expression level
of miR-524-5p) þ (16.1  expression level of miR-1227)
þ (12.797  expression level of miR-518b) þ (12.109 
expression level of miR-566).
All statistical analyses were performed with MATLAB software (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Mass), and
SPSS 13.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill) was
used to conduct survival analyses. All tests were 2-tailed,
and the significance level was set at P < .05.

miRNA expression profiles in patients with glioblastoma multiforme, the rows represent risky and protective miRNAs, and the columns represent patients. The black dotted lines on the top in A and B represent the miRNA signature cutoff.

There was no significant difference in clinicopathologic features between the 2 sets (Table 1). We used Cox regression
to analyze each of 1145 miRNAs in the training set and
identified 5 miRNAs (miR-181d, miR-518b, miR-524-5p,
miR-566, and miR-1227) that were associated significantly
with OS (P < .01) and had expression levels with a 1.5fold difference between GBM and brain control.
We then applied the 5 miRNAs to develop a signature using the risk-score method. The 5-miRNA signature
risk score was calculated for each of the 41 patients in the
training set and then was used to divide them into a highrisk group and a low-risk group based on the cutoff value.
We observed that patients with a high-risk miRNA signature had shorter median OS and PFS than patients with a
low-risk signature: 381 days versus not reached (P ¼
.002) (Fig. 1A) and 218 days versus 516 days (P ¼ .006),
respectively (Fig. 1B).
Validation of the 5-MicroRNA Signature for
Survival Prediction in the Testing and
Combined Sets

We used the same risk-score formula and cutoff value
obtained from the training set for 41 patients in the testing set and 82 patients of in the combined set. Similarly,
patients with a high-risk miRNA signature had shorter
median OS than patients with a low-risk miRNA signature: 382 days versus 563 days (P ¼ .029) for the testing
set (Fig. 1C) and 382 days versus 591 days (P < .001) for
the combined set (Tiantan cohort) (Fig. 1E). Also,
patients with a high-risk signature had a shorter median
PFS than patients with a low-risk signature: 257 days ver818

sus 325 days P ¼ .068; marginally significant) for the testing set (Fig. 1D) and 226 days versus 459 days (P ¼ .001)
for the combined set (Fig. 1F).
The distribution of patient risk scores, OS, and
miRNA expression in GBM is illustrated in Figure 2 for
the training set and the testing set (Fig. 2). Patients with
high risk scores appeared to express higher levels of risky
miRNAs (miR-518b and miR-566), and patients with
low risk scores tended to express higher levels of protective
miRNAs (miR-181d, miR-524-5p, and miR-1227).
Patients with low risk scores survived longer than those
with high risk scores.
Additional Validation of the 5-MicroRNA
Signature in an Independent Cohort and
in the Cancer Genome Atlas Data Set for
Survival Prediction

First, to confirm whether changes in expression levels of the
5 miRNAs measured both by profiling and by quantitative
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis were consistent and convertible, we randomly selected 3 patients from each of the highrisk group and the low-risk group in the Tiantan cohort and
measured the expression of the 5 miRNAs in those 6 patients
by using qRT-PCR. We observed consistent changes in
expression levels of the 5 miRNAs using both methods.
Next, we applied qRT-PCR to validate the 5miRNA signature in the independent cohort. Because, in
general, no ‘‘housekeeping’’ miRNAs were available to
make the profiling data and qRT-PCR data convertible,
to use the same cutoff value from the profiling data, we
normalized the qRT-PCR data against the average

expression of the 5 miRNAs in the 6 patient samples by
qRT-PCR and then normalized against the average
expression of the 5 miRNAs in the same 6 samples by
profiling. After normalizing, expression levels of the 5
miRNAs were used to calculate patient risk scores. The
patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups
based on the same cutoff point that was determined in the
training set. The patients with high-risk signatures had
significantly shorter median OS and PFS than the patients
with low-risk signatures (OS: 263 days vs not reached; P
¼ .005 [Fig. 3A]; PFS: 151 days vs 366 days; P ¼ .002
[Fig. 3B]), consistent with findings in the Tiantan cohort.
To determine whether the method of miRNA measurement could affect patient stratification according to the
risk-score method, we used the independent cohort to compare profiling data and qRT-PCT data from the 5 miRNAs
for patient stratification. By using the risk-score formula
based on qRT-PCR data, we calculated the risk score for
each patient. At a cutoff score of 0.79 (AUC, 0.738), the
patients with a high-risk signature had significantly shorter
median OS and PFS than the patients with a low-risk signature (OS: 263 days vs not reached; P ¼ .005 [Fig. 3C];
PFS: 211 days vs 366 days; P ¼ .009 [Fig. 3D]). Thirtythree of 35 patients (94.3%) were classified concordantly
classified into a high-risk group and a low-risk group based
on either the profiling data (Fig. 3A,B) or the qRT-PCR
data (Fig. 3C,D), with disagreement for 2 patients between
the 2 types of expression data (1 patients who had shorter
survival was misclassified into the low-risk group by profiling, and another patient who had longer survival was misclassified into the high-risk group by the qRT-PCR data).
Patient distribution is illustrated in Figure 3 according to
the risk-score analysis based on profiling values (Fig. 3E)
and qRT-PCR values (Fig. 3F).
In the TCGA data set, we observed 3 of 5 miRNAs
that were present in the TCGA set (miR-181d, miR518b, and miR-566) and used that 3-miRNA subset to
validate 345 GBMs from the TCGA data set. First, we
performed Z-score transformation on expression levels
across the GBMs for each of the 3 miRNAs; then, we
summed the Z-score–transformed expression levels of
the 3 miRNAs into 1 score for each sample. Univariate
Cox regression analysis indicated that the 3-miRNA subset was associated significantly with OS (P ¼ .003). By
using the median value of the scores as the threshold, we
divided GBMs into a high-risk group and a low-risk
group. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the 3miRNA subset significantly classified the patients with
GBM into a high-risk group and a low-risk group (P ¼
.003) (Fig. 4).

The 5-MicroRNA Signature and Patient Survival
Independent From Other Clinicopathologic
Factors

We conducted univariate Cox regression analysis using clinical and genetic variables for the Tiantan cohort (Table 1)
and observed that the variables 5-miRNA signature (risk
score), extent of tumor resection, receipt temozolomide
(TMZ) therapy, preoperative KPS score, and IDH1 mutation status were associated statistically with OS and PFS;
however, the variables sex, age, and MGMT promoter methylation status were not associated with OS or PFS (Table 2).
A multivariate Cox regression analyses with stepwise
variable selection in the Tiantan and independent cohorts
indicated that the 5-miRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor in the Tiantan cohort (OS: HR,
1.41; 95% CI, 1.19-1.66; P < .001; PFS: HR, 1.31; 95%
CI, 1.12-1.53; P ¼ .001) (Table 2) and in the independent cohort (OS: HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.35-4.92; P ¼ .004;
PFS: HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.05-1.89; P ¼ .025) (Table 3).
TMZ therapy also was verified as an independent prognostic factor, because better survival was associated with
the receipt of TMZ treatment (Tables 2 and 3).

prediction and observed that patients who had low risk
scores and received TMZ treatment had the best survival,
and patients who had high risk scores without receiving
TMZ treatment had the worst survival (OS: not reached
vs 281 days; P < .001 [Fig. 5E]; PFS, 630 days vs 193
days; P < .001 [Fig. 5F]). There were no significant differences in survival benefit between patients with low risk
scores who did not receive TMZ treatment and patients
with high risk scores who did receive TMZ treatment
(OS: 591 days vs 526 days, respectively; P ¼ .613 [marginally significant] [Fig. 5E]; PFS: 349 days vs 350 days,
respectively; P ¼ .603 [marginally significant] [Fig. 5F]).
DISCUSSION
The survival of patients with GBM varies from 1 week to
a few years, suggesting that the clinical prognostic factors
reach their limit in identifying prognostic subgroups for
personalized treatment. This study, we investigated Chinese patients with GBM to identify an independent prognostic miRNA signature. Patients who had high risk
scores for the signature had shorter OS and PFS compared
with patients who had low risk scores.
The current results indicate that both the 5-miRNA
signature and TMZ therapy were independent prognostic
factors, and patients who had low risk scores and received
TMZ treatment had better survival. This association may
help predict the clinical outcome of patients with GBM
who receive TMZ treatment according to their 5-miRNA
signature, it may identify patients who are candidates for
more aggressive therapy. Thus, the combination of the 5miRNA signature and TMZ treatment may be the best
predictor of survival for patients with GBM.
A recent study mined expression data based on 305
miRNAs from 222 GBMs in the TCGA data set and identified a 10-miRNA prognostic signature.16 We did not observe
any overlapped miRNAs between those 10 miRNAs and our
5 miRNAs. Seven of the 10-miRNAs that were identified in
our data set were used to validate our data set in a hierarchic
clustering analysis and did not significantly classify GBMs
into high-risk and low-risk groups, possibly because only 7 of
the 10 miRNAs were covered in our data set.
Although the 2 studies applied similar statistical
methods, such as risk scoring, identification of the 2 different miRNA signatures may be contributed by a few differences in terms of the materials and methods used. The
Agilent human 8x15k miRNA has 470 miRNAs, and the
Illumina human v2.0 BeadChip has 1146 miRNAs. In
the 10-miRNA study, 164 of 470 miRNAs were filtered
out that were not detected, and the remaining 305 miRNAs were used for further analysis. We are not sure how

many miRNAs overlapped between the 305 miRNAs
(not available) and the 1146 miRNAs. Also, the 2 GBM
sources were derived from different ethical populations.
Evaluation of an miRNA signature in patients using
qRT-PCR may be a practical procedure, because qRT-PCR
generally produces accurate and reproducible results in
RNA quantification when only a small amount of fresh or
paraffin-embedded specimens are avaliable.17,18 This is
especially clinically useful for tissues sampled from the brain.
We used qRT-PCR to validate our 5-miRNA signature in
our independent cohort of 35 patients and obtained results
that were consistent with those from the Tiantan cohort.
Among our 5 miRNAs, only the miR-181 family
was studied relatively more in glioma. The human miR181 family includes 6 members (miR-181a-1, miR-181a2, miR-181b-1, miR-181b-2, miR-181c, and miR-181d)
that are brain-enriched miRNAs.19 MiR-181a and miR181b are down-regulated in gliomas and inhibit cell
growth, proliferation, and invasion, and they trigger apoptosis as tumor suppressors.20-22 MiR-181a has been correlated with the sensitivity of glioma cells to radiotherapy,
and miR-181b has been associated with prognosis and
therapeutic response in patients with glioma.23-25 To our
knowledge, there have been no functional studies of miR181d, miR-518b, miR-524-5p, miR-566, or miR-1227
in cancer. Therefore, when a larger, prospective validation
of the 5-miRNA signature for predicting outcomes in
patients with primary GBM is warranted, functional and
mechanistic studies on the 5-miRNA signature should be
carried out to further support its clinical application in
primary GBM.
