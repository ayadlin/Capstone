ABSTRACT
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy with increasing
incidence worldwide.
The majority of thyroid cancer cases are well differentiated with favorable
outcome. However, undifferentiated thyroid cancers are one of the most lethal human
malignancies because of their invasiveness, metastatization and refractoriness even
to the most recently developed therapies.
In this study we show for the first time a significant hyperactivation of ROCK/
HDAC6 pathway in thyroid cancer tissues, and its negative correlation with p53 DNA
binding ability.
We demonstrate that a small compound, SP600125 (SP), is able to induce cell
death selectively in undifferentiated thyroid cancer cell lines by specifically acting
on the pathogenic pathways of cancer development. In detail, SP acts on the ROCK/
HDAC6 pathway involved in dedifferentiation and invasiveness of undifferentiated
human cancers, by restoring its physiological activity level. As main consequence,
cancer cell migration is inhibited and, at the same time, cell death is induced through
the mitotic catastrophe. Moreover, SP exerts a preferential action on the mutant
p53 by increasing its DNA binding ability. In TP53-mutant cells that survive mitotic
catastrophe this process results in p21 induction and eventually lead to premature
senescence. In conclusion, SP has been proved to be able to simultaneously block cell
replication and migration, the two main processes involved in cancer development
and dissemination, making it an ideal candidate for developing new drugs against
anaplastic thyroid cancer.

worldwide [1-3]. Although well-differentiated cancers

mortality due to thyroid cancer [1, 4].
The pathogenesis of thyroid cancers is characterized
by sequential accumulation of different genetic alterations.
In particular, development of either PDTCs or ATCs
results from genomic instability and accumulation of
multiple aberrations leading to cell cycle deregulation
and acquisition of anchorage-independent growth. These
alterations are known to be responsible for the aggressive
clinical features of these lethal tumors that are resistant to
radioiodine, to conventional chemotherapy and external
radiation, and even to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) [1,
5-7].
In the last decades, numerous alterations in proteins
involved in thyroid cancer dedifferentiation process,
including RAS, ALK, β-catenin and p53, have been
identified [8-10]. In particular, mutations in β-catenin and
p53 genes are almost absent in WDTCs but can be found
respectively in up to 60% and 80% of ATCs [5].
In the present study, we explore the efficacy of a
small compound, SP600125 (SP) in counteracting the
aggressive tumorigenic behavior of undifferentiated
thyroid cancer cells.
SP is a reversible ATP-competitive multikinase
inhibitor with recently discovered intriguing anticancer
properties. It was shown that SP modifies cell cycle
progression and causes endoreduplication with preferential
activity against p53 null cells [11-13], induces p53independent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [14-15] and
increases cell sensitivity to various anti-proliferative drugs
[16-17]. All of the reported mechanisms of action make SP
an ideal candidate for developing new therapies against
aggressive cancers, such as ATCs. However, most of the
previously described SP actions imply a lack of target
specificity that would undermine any further clinical
development as anticancer treatment.
Here we describe for the first time a remarkable
SP selectivity against cancer cells harboring TP53 point
mutations and concomitant hyper-activation of Rho
associated kinase (ROCK). We demonstrate that SP
induces cell death and migration inhibition through the
activation of mutant p53 and concomitant ROCK/HDAC6
pathway inhibition.
Moreover we provide new insights about the
relationship between p53 inactivation and ROCK
hyperactivation in thyroid cancer.
It has recently been reported tha loss of p53 results
in hyperactivation of RhoA/ROCK pathway and this can
lead to increased invasiveness [18-20]. In agreement
with these findings our results shows for the first time an
increase of ROCK activity in PTDCs and a strong inverse
correlation between p53 DNA binding ability and ROCK
activity in thyroid cancer tissues and cell lines.
The relevance and the potential impact of our
findings are underlined by recent studies emphasizing
the importance of p53 targeted therapy both in preclinical
and clinical settings [21-23]. Furthermore they highlight
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the role of ROCK kinases in cancer cell invasion, in
accordance with the recent clinical trials with ROCKtargeting compounds [24-26].

RESULTS
SP inhibits cell proliferation in a p53 dependent
way
SP anti-proliferative effects were assessed in vitro
on a normal thyroid derived cell line and seven thyroid
cancer cell lines (Figure 1A) with genetic alterations
typical of different thyroid cancer subtypes such as
BRAFV600E variant, RET/PTC translocation, PI3K
pathway hyperactivation and TP53 point mutations (see
Supplemental Material and Methods). In accordance
with previously published data [13], analysis of growth
inhibition curves revealed that, at concentrations equal
or higher than 30 μM, SP is highly effective against
poorly differentiated cells that lack p53 activity (Figure
1B). Moreover we show for the first time a preferential
activity of low dose SP treatment on cells with missense
inactivating TP53 alterations versus TP53-null ones. The
selectivity against p53 mutant cells became even more
apparent at concentrations of 10 μM or lower (Figure
1B). The relative amounts of p53 protein in our cell lines
was confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure 1C).
Importantly, no significant association between BRAF or
PI3K pathways hyperactivation and SP antiproliferative
effects was found (Supplementary Table 1).
The concentrations of 10 and 20 μM were thus
chosen for further investigations.

SP induces premature senescence through the
p53/p21 pathway
Up to date, there are contrasting reports about p53
involvement in the SP mechanism of action [11, 13-15,
27]. To elucidate this point, three cell lines representing
different TP53 status were chosen for further examination:
the TP53 wild-type TPC1, the TP53 p.P152L mutant HTC/
C3, and the p53 pseudo-null SW1736.
The investigation of p53 levels and post-translational
modification showed that 10 μM SP treatment leads to p53
phosphorylation at Serine 15 and acetylation at Lysine 382
only in HTC/C3 cells whereas no significant modifications
were detected in TPC1 cells; a significant increase in p53
levels, compatible with p53 activation and stabilization,
was detected in HTC/C3 cells (Figure 2A and 2B), as these
modification deeply affect p53 half-life and activity [28];
the fact that after SP treatment they were induced only in
the p53 mutated cell lines made this pathway noteworthy
of further investigations.
One of the main mechanisms of mutant p53

inactivation is the retention in cytoplasm, as most of p53
post-translational modifications take place in the nucleus
[28]. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that 10
μM SP treatment leads to p53 nuclear translocation only
in HTC/C3 cells whereas no significant translocation
could be detected in TPC1 cells (Figure 2C). In HTC/C3
cells these results were confirmed by cellular fractioning
experiments, showing a significant increase in the p53
nuclear fraction (Figure 2D). Moreover, a significant
increase in p53 Serine 15 phosphorylation and Lysine
382 acetylation was found only in the nuclear fraction
of HTC/C3 cells (Figure 2D and 2E). In accordance with
the detected post-translational modifications, an increase
in p53 DNA binding activity was detected in HTC/C3
cells after SP treatment, whereas no similar changes were
observed in TPC1 cells (Figure 2F).
These results suggested that not only SP treatment
is able to induce nuclear translocation of the mutant p53,
but also promotes its functional activation. Therefore, the
effects of SP treatment on the p53-downstream effector
p21 were investigated either without or in the presence
of Ischemin. This is a synthetic suppressor of p53
transcriptional activity through the inhibition of its binding
to the cofactor CBP after Lysine 382 acetylation [29].

We found that exposure to SP leads to a significant
increase in p21 level only in HTC/C3 cells. This increase
is, at least partially, dependent on p53 activity, as preincubation with Ischemin significantly reverted p21
induction (Figure 3A). Moreover, inhibition of p53 activity
partially reduced the anti-proliferative effect of SP on
HTC/C3 cells (Figure 3B), supporting the involvement of
p53/p21 pathway modulation in SP mechanism of action.
In order to investigate the unknown mechanisms of
p21 induction after SP treatment [11, 14, 30], 43 kinases
and 2 related total proteins were simultaneously analyzed
with Human Phospho-Kinase Antibody Array in HTC/
C3 cells. Significant changes in the level of β-catenin
and other proteins involved in cell migration and growth
control were detected after 60 hours of incubation with
10 μM SP (Supplementary Figure 1, Supplementary
Table 2). After 96 hours of treatment, the only
modifications conserving the level of significance were
p53 phosphorylation at Serine 15, FAK phosphorylation
at Tyrosine 397 and β-catenin increases (Supplementary
Figure 1, Supplementary Table 2).
One of the main consequences of p53/p21 pathway
activation is the induction of cellular senescence. In fact

cytoplasmic vacuoles and dishomogeneous content.
Up to 20% of the surviving HTC/C3 cells showed the
senescence-specific X-gal staining. These effects were
abolished by inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity
through Ischemin pre-treatment (Figure 3C).
The presence of nuclear abnormalities such as
heterochromatic foci, multinucleation and nuclear
blebbing, lysosomal compartment expansion and positive
γ-H2A.X staining in a large fraction of SP treated HTC/

C3 cells (Supplementary Figure 2) confirmed the presence
of cellular senescence [31-32]. To date, increases in cell
dimensions and in p21 expression following SP treatment
have been occasionally reported [27, 33]. On the other
hand, SP-induced p53-dependent premature senescence
has never been reported. These data support that mutant
p53 reactivation and senescence induction may contribute
to the overall antiproliferative effect of SP.

SP induces cell death through mitotic catastrophe

SP on the microtubule network organization of the cells
was examined. A semi-quantitative tubulin fractionation
assay revealed that SP induces a significant increase in
tubulin polymerization in p53-mutant and pseudo-null
cells (Figure 5A and C) together with a consistent increase
in its acetylation at Lysine 40 (Figure 5A and B). This
modification is usually found on stable microtubules but
can result in mitosis block or abnormal chromosome
segregation, when present at supraphysiological levels.
Confocal microscopy revealed a complete upheaval of
normal microtubule architecture in HTC/C3 cells. While
the typical polarized acetylated fibers emerging from
the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) were clearly
recognizable in untreated cells, the microtubules appeared
thicker, bundle-like, widespread through the cytosol
without an organizing center and completely unrelated
to the nucleus after SP treatment. Importantly, only
minor alterations were detected in TPC1 cells while an
intermediate effect was detected in SW1736 cells (Figure
5D) Therefore, alterations in tubulin dynamics may
represent one of the main effects of SP, and elucidation of
the exact mechanisms by which SP induces microtubule
alterations represents a key point for its further
development as anticancer drug.

The activation of p53/p21 pathway is responsible
for SP cytostatic action by inducing premature senescence
in cells which survived SP treatment; however the
exact mechanism by which low doses of SP exert
cytotoxic actions remains elusive. It has been reported
previously that SP inhibits distinct kinases involved in
cell cycle regulation and endoreduplication [11-12, 34].
We investigated whether SP is able to induce mitotic
alterations in our cell lines.
Our results show that SP significantly affects mitosis
in HTC/C3 cells and, to a lesser extent, in SW1736 cells,
starting from 48 hours of incubation. In addition to the
reduction in the frequency of mitotic cells (Figure 4A),
morphological analysis of mitotic figures revealed an
increase in the percentage of abnormal and multipolar
mitotic forms (Figure 4B and 4C), defects that usually
lead to mitotic slippage and aberrant division. No similar
alterations were detected in TPC1 cells. Considering that
aberrant mitosis and unbalanced DNA content can lead
to death through mitotic catastrophe or to premature
senescence, we hypothesize that mitotic cell death is the
main anti-proliferative mechanism of SP, while induction
of premature senescence in cells surviving the cytotoxic
action is a later event and a crucial additional property
that starts configuring SP as a pleiotropic anticancer agent.

SP exerts its main effects through direct inhibition
of ROCK/HDAC6 pathway

SP effects are the result of alterations in
microtubules network

In a previous screening, SP significantly inhibited
the activity of ROCK [38], a kinase recently described
to control tubulin and β-catenin stability through their
main deacetylating enzyme HDAC6 [39-41]. Importantly,
both enzymes are involved in cancer invasiveness and
metastasization, and their activity was found to be
increased in several undifferentiated cancers [24-25, 4245].
Therefore, we first confirmed the dose dependent

High concentrations SP were shown to induce
tubulin polymerization in vitro [33]. Microtubule poisons
are well known anticancer drugs causing primary failure in
mitosis progression and mitotic cell death with a stronger
effect in p53 deficient cells [35-37]. Hence the effect of

inhibitory effect of SP on the ROCK activity in a cellfree enzyme inhibition assay (Figure 6A). Subsequently,
basal ROCK activity was examined, showing that cell
lines derived from undifferentiated thyroid cancers
have a significantly higher activity than those derived
from thyrocytes, a tendency accurately reflected by our
model cell lines (Figure 6B). Noticeably, in HTC/C3 and
SW1736 cells 10μM SP could counteract and reduce
the ROCK activity to the level of WDTCs, whereas the
inhibition was considerably lower in TPC1 cells (Figure
6C).
As a second step, we examined whether these
results were reflected by the downstream pathway. Indeed,
variations in cytoplasmic HDACs activity reflected the
ROCK ones. The basal cytoplasmic HDACs activity in
HTC/C3 and SW1736 was higher than in TPC1, and SP
treatment exerted a significant inhibitory effect (Figure
6D).
In particular, ROCK regulates the activity of
HDAC6 through direct phosphorylation of TPPP1. TPPP1/

HDAC6 interaction results in the inhibition of HDAC6
activity while TPPP1 phosphorylation causes HDAC6
release and activation. HDAC6 then regulates microtubule
and β-catenin stability [40].
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed
that SP treatment significantly increases the interactions
between TPPP1 and HDAC6 (Figure 6E), a modification
accompanied by a significant enhancement of the
acetylation of β-catenin (Figure 6E) and tubulin
(previously reported in Figure 5A, 5B and 5D).
In addition, further important consequences of
the ROCK/HDAC6 pathway inhibition include the
impairment of cell migration and invasiveness [39-40,
46-47]. Therefore we examine if SP treatment influences
these processes.
A Wound-Healing assay revealed that SP is able
to actively inhibit undifferentiated cancer cell migration.
After SP treatment, TPC1 cells replenished the scratch
whereas no progression toward the free edge was achieved
by HTC/C3 cells and only partial replenishment was seen

correlation with p53 activity

in SW1736 cells at 16 hours post wound (Figure 7A and
7D). In agreement with these data, an invasion assay
showed a significant inhibition by SP of cell invasivity
potential in HTC/C3 and SW1736, while TPC1 showed
a lower but unaltered invasiveness (Figure 7B and 7E).
As last step, we investigated β-catenin localization
because it can act as pro-proliferative factor when it
is cleaved from the cell membrane and relocated to the
nucleus. In both resting and migrating HTC/C3 cells,
β-catenin is localized at the cell membrane (Figure 7C,
arrowheads). Moreover, SP treatment enhanced β-catenin
signal and inhibited its relocation from the intercellular
adhesion surface toward the leading edge of cell migration
as indicated by arrowheads (Figure 7C). Noteworthy, in
none of the cited conditions we observed an increased
nuclear staining for β-catenin.

Since no data about ROCK involvement in
thyroid cancer development are currently available, we
collected 12 tissue samples from patients that underwent
thyroidectomy for compressive multinodular goiter,
PTC or PDTC (Table 1). Genetic screening revealed that
patient 9 is heterozygous for TP53 c.920-2A > G, a variant
causing alternative splicing of exon 9 and premature stop
codon, while patients 5, 6, 8 and 10 resulted heterozygous
for BRAFV600E variant, and patient 8 carried C228T TERT
promoter mutation.
Western blot analysis of protein extracts showed
variable alterations in p53 levels in all cancer samples,
with significant increases at densitometry in PDTCs ones
compared to goiters ones (7.671±1.198 vs. 1.989±0.2921,
respectively, p < 0.01). Low molecular weight bands of
approximately 40-46 kDa were detected only in PDTCs

truncated forms of p53 that are known to be overexpressed
in a significant fraction of undifferentiated cancer cells
[48-49].
Interestingly, the highest phosphorylation levels
of a direct ROCK substrate, MYPT, were detected in the
patient harbouring the p53 mutation.

anticancer agent.
SP appears highly effective against ATCs
and PDTCs in vitro, two histotypes of highly lethal
malignancies characterized by local invasion, regional and
distant metastases, disease recurrence and refractoriness
to currently available anticancer therapies, including
conventional and new-generation compounds [1, 4].
Importantly, we show that SP is highly effective in
blocking thyroid cancer cell growth and migration and
in the induction of mitotic catastrophe through direct
inhibition of ROCK, a kinase involved in the regulation
of cell migration, microtubule dynamics and β-catenin
turnover [39-40, 46, 50]. This mechanism of action may
be particularly important in anticancer therapy considering
that Rho/ROCK pathway is hyperactivated in different
human neoplasia and its activity correlates with metastatic
disease [24-25, 42-43, 51-52]. No data on Rho/ROCK
activation in thyroid cancer were available until now as
the only previous study claiming a possible involvement
of this pathway was performed on ARO cells [53],

DISCUSSION
In the present study we provide preliminary data
on ROCK pathway alterations in thyroid cancer and we
prove that SP retains an intriguing pleiotropic potential as

which are now known not to be of thyroid origin [54].
Here we show for the first time that ROCK pathway is
hyperactivated in PDTCs with defective p53 activity. In
fact those derived from PDTCs had the highest levels of
ROCK activity, which was reduced to the level of WDTCs
upon SP treatment.
In accordance with a previous work [39], inhibition
of ROCK affected HDAC6 function. Here we show
that this is mediated by an enhanced TPPP1-HDAC6
interactions. These alterations can account for the
observed tubulin hyperstabilization and consequent
mitotic abnormalities. The inability to proceed through
the mitotic process is one of the known possible causes of
cell death, mainly through mitotic catastrophe induction,
and possibly accounts for the largest part of the antioncogenic effects of SP here described (Figure 9). Since
an increasing literature background [24, 26, 39] report
a strict relation between the inhibition of ROCK/TPP1/
HDAC6 pathway and cell motility alterations, it is likely
that this inhibition can account for the inhibition of cell
migration and invasion observed after SP treatment.
In addition, we provide new insights about the
relationship between p53 inactivation and ROCK
hyperactivation in thyroid cancer. In fact the highest
ROCK activity was detected in the only PDTC with
TP53 mutation. Interestingly, this tumor was particulartly
aggressive (Table 1). Our results demonstrate a strong

inverse correlation between p53 DNA binding ability
and ROCK activity in both tissue samples and cell lines.
These findings are in agreement with previous reports
of RhoA/ROCK pathway hyperactivation and increased
invasiveness in cells with loss of p53 activity [18, 20].
Thus, the SP strong inhibitory effect against ROCK can
be considered as the sum of direct inhibition through
kinase binding and indirect inhibition through p53
pathway restoration. This perspective can also explain
the differences observed among p53 mutated and p53 null
ones, as in the latter the second mechanism of action is
not possible.
We also show here that premature senescence
is induced by SP in the HTC/C3 cells harboring TP53
inactivating missense mutations. Since premature
senescence appears at later time points than mitotic
catastrophe and affect SP survived cells, one hypothesis
can be that it is a secondary mechanism developed
by cells surviving the SP-induced polyploidy and cell
death (Figure 9). It is conceivable that the nodal point
of this event is its dependence on the reactivation of the
expressed p53 variants. The reactivation process restores
cell responsiveness to chromosomal aberrations induced
by microtubule alterations and results in senescence
induction. On the other hand, the reactivation of p53
activity can trigger the so-called Oncogene-Induced
Senescence (OIS). It has been demonstrated that the

Figure 9: Proposed schematic representation of SP action. The scheme shows SP effects on sensitive cancer cells and supposed

mechanisms of action as derived from the integration between experimental data and literature background. The alteration of ROCK/
HDAC6 pathways leads to tubulin abnormalities and this could be responsible of mitotic catastrophe in the major part of treated cells (~80
%). Longer incubation with SP leads to induction of premature senescence through p53/p21 pathway activation in a significant amount of
surviving cells (~15 %).

constant MAPK intracellular signaling induced by RAS
or RAF mutations causes OIS rather than malignant
transformation when not accompanied by other
fundamental alterations that disrupt cell cycle control. The
restoration of p53 activity can thus inhibit cell proliferation
by allowing the activation of OIS [32]. Interestingly, these
processes have been demonstrated also in thyroid cancer
models, mainly in relation to the presence of BRAFV600E
alteration, one of the main target of new TKI anticancer
therapies [7, 55-57]. The speculation about OIS induction
after p53 activity restoration by SP is supported by the
selectivity against cell lines harbouring p53 mutations and
the lack of effects on wild type or p53 pseudo-null ones.
Although the exact mechanism by which SP
influences p53 activity still needs to be clarified, the
differences in the growth inhibition may be partially
dependent on the greater ROCK inhibition observed in
HTC/C3 cells versus the p53 pseudo-null ones. In fact,
as ROCK activity is enhanced by p53 alterations [18, 20],
the restoration of p53 activity can negatively influence
the ROCK one. The induction of senescence in HTC/
C3 surviving clones in contrast to the maintenance of
the proliferation phenotype in SW1736 ones then adds
further difference to the final growth inhibitory result of
SP treatment.
In conclusion, our studies brought new evidence of
ROCK/HDAC6 pathway involvement in thyroid tumors
aggressiveness.
By targeting this pathway and the well known p53
alterations, SP inhibits cell replication and migration at
the same time, the two major processes involved in cancer
development and dissemination thus revealing novel
anticancer effects of SP in highly aggressive thyroid
cancer cells. These effects may render SP a potential
therapeutic agent in undifferentiated malignancies.
