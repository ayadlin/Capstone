ABSTRACT
Deubiquitinases are deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which remove ubiquitin
from proteins, thus regulating their proteasomal degradation, localization and activity.
Here, we discuss DUBs as anti-cancer drug targets.

code, in which the different chain topologies have distinct
signaling functions [4]. The removal of ubiquitins or
polyubiquitin chains from the target protein is catalyzed
by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Therefore, DUBs
reverse the function of E3 ubiquitin ligases [5]. The
human genome encodes approximately 100 DUBs that are
subdivided into 5 families based on sequence and structural
similarity: ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), ubiquitin
carboxy-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), ovarian-tumor
proteases (OTUs), JAMM Motif Proteases (JAMMs),
Machado-Joseph disease protein proteases (MJD) [5].
Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small, highly conserved protein
that is added onto primary amino groups of the acceptor
protein through an enzymatic cascade involving sequential
actions of E1, E2, and E3 conjugating proteins. It is the
E3s that are primarily involved in substrate recognition,
and, accordingly, there are more E3s than their E1 and E2
counterparts. The E3s can be subdivided into the really
interesting new gene (RING) family (~300 in the human
genome) and the homologous E6-associated protein
carboxy terminus (HECT) family (28 in the human
genome) [6]. Both types of E3 link E2 enzymes with
substrates, but they differ in that RINGs do not themselves
directly transfer ubiquitin, whereas the HECT family
forms an intermediate thioester linkage with the ubiquitin
C terminus. Although the RING-E2 interaction occurs at
some distance from the E2 catalytic site, it is proposed to
facilitate ubiquitin transfer from the E2 by an allosteric
mechanism [7, 8].

INTRODUCTION
Posttranslational modification of proteins by
ubiquitin is a key regulatory event, and the enzymes
catalyzing these modifications have been the focus of
many studies. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), which
mediate the removal and processing of ubiquitin, might
be functionally important but are less well understood.
Approximately 100 human DUBs have been identified,
over 90% of which are cysteine-proteases whose catalytic
sites contain conserved cysteine (C), histidine (H) and
aspartate (D) residues [1]. By regulating the ubiquitin
system, DUBs play important roles in multiple biological
processes including the cell-cycle, DNA repair, chromatin
remodeling, and a wide range of signaling pathways.
Ubiquitylation is reversible process by which
ubiquitins are attached to proteins, either singly or in
chains. The ubiquitination pathway includes ubiquitinactivating (E1s), ubiquitin-conjugating (E2s) and
ubiquitin ligase enzymes (E3s), ultimately responsible
for the conjugation of ubiquitin to protein substrates (for
reviews see [2, 3]). Ubiquitin can be attached to substrate
proteins as a single moiety or in the form of polymeric
chains in which successive ubiquitin molecules are
connected through specific isopeptide bonds. These bonds
can be formed on any of the eight primary amines of
the ubiquitin molecule (linear/amino (N) terminus/M1,
K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48 and K63) and thus can
achieve a remarkable complexity, termed the ubiquitin

Deubiquitinases as emerging
targets for anticancer
therapeutics

Deubiquitylation and ubiquitylationare dynamic
and reversible post-translational modifications that are
involved in the regulation of various cellular pathways.
For a long time, functional studies of ubiquitylation
have focused on the function of ubiquitylating enzymes,
especially the E3 ligases, rather than deubiquitylating
enzymes (DUBs) that hydrolyze ubiquitinchains. One
reason may be the smaller number of DUBs in the human
genome compared to the larger number of E3 ligases,
implying broader substrate specificities of DUBs and
difficulties identifying the indirect targets. However,
recent studies have revealed that DUBs also actively
participate in controlling cellular events in cancer. DUBs
are also essential for processing ubiquitin precursors and
are important for recycling ubiquitin molecules from
target protein prior to their degradation and maintaining
the free ubiquitin pool in the cell. Here, we will discuss
the five different DUB families (USP, UCH, JAMM, OTU,
and MJD) and their known biochemical and physiological
roles in cancer. In this review, we examine these recent
insights, and attempt to provide a comprehensive overview
of what is known about this emerging post-translational
modification in cancer. In addition, we will propose some
directions for future studies.

Targeted the inhibition of ubiquitin-conjugating
enzymes and ligases could offer another therapeutic
modality. In addition, screening analyse of ubiquitin ligases
reveals G2E3 as a potential target for chemosensitizing
cancer cells [10]. Inhibition of NEDD8-related E1 enzyme
by MLN4924, E2 enzyme hCdc34 by CC0651, and E3
ligase MDM2 by RITA (NSC652287) and MI-219 reflects
this ongoing effort [11]. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) are
another class of emerging anticancer target that regulate
specific substrate proteins by reversing their ubiquitination
through the hydrolysis of isopeptide or a-peptide bonds
linking ubiquitin to the target protein [12]. If the target
protein is an oncogene, the associated DUB might stabilize
its cellular expression, which supports the identification
of DUB inhibitors that could reestablish normal protein
turnover, location, or activity [12]. Auranofin (Aur) inhibits
proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (DUBs) UCHL5
and USP14 rather than the 20S proteasome; inhibition
of the proteasome-associated DUBs is required for
Aur-induced cytotoxicity; and Aur selectively inhibits tumor
growth in vivo and induces cytotoxicity in cancer cells from
patients with acute myeloid leukemia [13]. This approach
might also avoid the deleterious side effects associated
with direct targeting of the proteasome. Genetic and/or
functional analysis have revealed DUBs in the category of
cancer-associated proteases, and their unique biochemical
structures have made them desirable targets for anticancer
therapies. In recent studies, more than 40 DUBs have been
involved in cancer directly or indirectly. These numbers
are not surprising, considering the various critical cellular
functions regulated by different DUBs and the diversity of
substrates used and regulated by them. A comprehensive list
of DUBs altered in different cancers is provided in Table 1.

Ubiquitin proteasome
system-targeted anticancer
therapeutics
Covalent attachment of ubiquitin, a highly conserved
protein, to a target protein is a means of regulating protein
half-life, localization, and activity. Because protein
homeostasis is essential for the survival of all cells, but
more essential to cancer cells, modulation of individual
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) components
might present an opportunity for therapeutic targeting.
Consequently, many compounds with proteasome
inhibitory activity have been developed, including
bortezomib ( Velcade; Millenium Pharmaceuticals), which
is a synthetic dipeptide boronic acid that reversibly inhibits
the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S enzymatic
core of the proteasome and induces apoptosis in several
malignancies. Velcade is approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients
with mantle cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma, even
those resistant to doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, melphalan,
and dexamethasone, and is commonly used in combination
with many of these agents [9]. Amplified protein synthesis
(immunoglobulin) in many myeloma cells might
underlie their clinical sensitivity to bortezomib and other
proteasome inhibitors, because solid tumors do not have
a similar commitment to elevated protein synthesis and
are not clinically responsive to these drugs. This narrow
therapeutic application, combined with some toxicity
(sensory neuropathy), might be circumvented by novel
proteasome inhibitory molecules [9].

Deubiquitinases in cancer
It is now well known that DUBs have significant
impacts on the regulation of multiple biological processes
such as cell-cycle control, DNA repair, chromatin
remodeling and several signaling pathways that are
frequently altered in cancer [5, 14] (Table 1). As a result,
different DUB functions are directly and indirectly
involved in tumorigenesis.

DUB-associated mutations in cancer
Recurrent mutations of DUBs are rare in cancer
with the exception of CYLD. Germline mutations of the
tumor-suppressor gene CYLD are prevalent in familial
cylindromatosis, a genetic condition that leads to a
predisposition for developing multiple skin tumors [15].

a USP is the fusion of the promoter of CDH11 to the
full-length USP6 gene leading to upregulated
transcript levels of USP6 [16]. The USP1 amino acid motif
420–520 is necessary and sufficient for UAF1 binding.
USP1 autocleavage can occur in cis, and can be altered by
a cancer-associated mutation [17].

cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis [25]. Some DUBs
such as CYLD, USP5, USP13, USP15, USP17, USP37,
USP39 and USP44 are essential regulators of events
occurring in mitosis. As a consequence, CYLD is crucial
for timely entry into mitosis through the regulation of
polo-like kinase 1 [26, 27]. USP5 in melanoma suppressed
cell growth by reinforcing the S/G2-M checkpoint,
enhancing extrinsic caspase activation through modulation
of p53 and FAS levels and amplifying the apoptotic
activity of kinase inhibitors [28]. Moreover, USP13 is
recruited by the ubiquitin-recognition protein Ufd1 to
antagonize anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C)-Cdh1mediated ubiquitylation of Skp2, thereby accumulating
the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 and causing a
concomitant cell-cycle delay [29]. USP15 stabilizes newly
synthesized RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) and
rescues its expression at the mitotic exit [30]. Moreover,
USP17 was differentially expressed during the cell cycle,
and it was discovered that USP17-knockdown caused
a G1 cell cycle block and inhibited the proliferation of
tumor-derived cell lines by attenuating GTPase signaling,
and that USP17 is tightly regulated during cell division
and its expression is necessary to coordinate cell cycle
progression [30, 31]. Deubiquitinase USP37 is activated
by CDK2 to antagonize APC(CDH1) and promote S
phase entry [32]. USP39 is essential for mitotic spindle
checkpoint integrity and depletion of USP39 in mRNA
processing contributes to a specific reduction in Aurora
B-mRNA levels [33]. USP44 prevents the premature
activation of APC/C by stabilizing the APC/C-inhibitory
Mad2–Cdc20 complex through deubiquitylation which
contributes to the generation of the switch-like transition
controlling anaphase entry [34]. In contrast, USP50 is
involved in the G2/M checkpoint and serves as a regulator
of HSP90-dependent Wee1 stability to suppress entry into
mitosis [35]. Furthermore, USP17L2 (known as DUB3)

Development of small molecule inhibitors
against DUBs
DUBs, as therapeutic targets in cancer and other
diseases [14, 18, 19], and DUBs play important roles in
recycling ubiquitin monomers to prevent proteasomal
degradation of proteins tagged with ubiquitin, and in
trimming ubiquitin from tagged proteins [20, 21]. DUBs
have been described as a class of anticancer targets; inhibitors
of these enzymes were discussed above in the Proteasome
section. It is the second function, sparing of target proteins
by the removal of conjugated ubiquitin, that has made DUBs
attractive targets for cancer and other diseases [20]. In the
past decade, tool compounds and/or preclinical development
candidate small molecule DUB inhibitors have been
reported; these compounds were identified as inhibitors of
several DUBs and have a range of reported selectivities with
respect to other DUBs and other cysteine proteases [22–24].
Some examples of these inhibitors are given below; their
story is a chronicle of the state of DUB-based anticancer
drug development up to the present time (Table 2).

Cell-cycle regulation
Many facts have revealed that DUBs play a critical
role in cell-cycle progression since several DUBs are
integral components of the core cell-cycle machinery
and cell-cycle checkpoints. Functional studies have
demonstrated that USP28 play an important part in
regulating the stability of c-Myc, a central modulator of

deubiquitylates and is responsible for the stabilization of
Cdc25A to promote oncogenic transformation in human
breast cancers. In addition, USP17L2 is an example of
a transforming ubiquitin hydrolase that subverts a key
component of the cell cycle machinery [36]. Moreover,
USP2 directly interacts with cyclin D1 and promotes
its stabilization by antagonizing ubiquitin-dependent
degradation. In addition, targeting USP2 is an effective
approach to induce growth suppression in cancer cells
with aberrant overexpression of cyclin D1 [37]. USP19
regulates cell proliferation and p27(Kip1) levels in a cell
context-dependent manner through both E3 ligase KPC1dependent and KPC1-independent mechanisms [38].
Likewise, USP7 (a mdm2 regulator of p53 function) is
essential in cell proliferation and differentiation, through
its regulatory activity on phosphatase and tensin homolog
and FOXO localization [39, 40]. Moreover, CSN5/
Jab1 acts as a modulator of the mammalian cell cycle,
preventing senescence and endocycle as well as the proper
progression of the somatic cell cycle [41]. Finally, BAP1
forms complexes with the transcription factors Yin Yang 1
(YY1) and host cell factor 1 (HCF-1), and controls cellcycle progression at G1/S by co-regulating transcription
from HCF-1/E2F-governed promoters [42, 43].

damage checkpoint signaling through the deubiquitination
and stabilization of claspin and enhances the activation of
ATR-Chk1 [53]. Moreover, USP28 is required to stabilize
Chk2 and 53BP1 in response to DNA damage; both
USP28 and Chk2 are required for DNA-damage-induced
apoptosis, and they accomplish this in part through the
regulation of the p53 induction of proapoptotic genes
such as PUMA [54]. USP34 promotes a feed-forward
loop to enforce ubiquitin signaling at DNA doublestrand breaks (DSBs), and highlights the critical roles
of ubiquitin dynamics in genome stability maintenance
[55]. Finally, USP47 has been identified as the enzyme
responsible for the deubiquitylation of the base excision
repair DNA polymerase (Polβ), thus playing an important
role in regulating DNA repair and maintaining genome
integrity [56]. In the last decade, protein alterations, such
as deubiquitination, have emerged as key modifications
in the control of DNA damage response (DDR) signaling.

Chromatin remodeling
Some DUBs interact with histones, predominately
H2A and H2B, the post-translational modifications of
which control chromatin structure dynamics and gene
expression, which are processes that are frequently
altered in cancer. To the best of our knowledge, there
are at least eight DUBs that can deubiquitylate histones
including BAP1, USP3, USP7, USP16, USP21, USP22,
MYSM1 and BRCC36 [57–60]. Both H2A and H2B
are deubiquitylated by these DUBs, although H2A is
preferentially targeted [61]. MYSM1, USP7, USP22 and
BRCC36 are part of the 2A-DUB, polycomb-repressive
complex 1, SAGA and BRCA1-A multisubunit complexes,
respectively [62–65]. However, studies have not identified
USP3 and USP16 as being involved in any of these
complexes, suggesting that their chromatin-regulatory
mechanisms might be different. Apart from histones, gene
transcription can be regulated by the deubiquitylation of
other chromatin-associated substrates. Therefore, USP22
regulates the protein stability of telomeric-repeat binding
factor 1 [66]. Nevertheless, MEL18 and BMI were
deubiquitylated by USP7 and USP11, two chromatinbound components of polycomb-repressive complex 1
complex components that influence the transcriptional
regulation of p16INK4a [65]. Furthermore, UCHL5, the
activation of which is crucial for the proteasome, also
interacts with the human lno80 chromatin-remodeling
complex [67]. Finally, as a result, BAP1 deubiquitylates
the chromatin-related protein host cell factor 1, which
regulates transcription by linking histone-modifying
enzymes to a subset of transcription factors [43].

DNA damage repair
The link between DNA damage repair and tumor
development is demonstrated by the increased cancer rates
reported for those disorders involving deficient DNA repair
mechanisms, such as Fanconi anemia. USP1 is responsible
for DNA damage repair by regulating Fanconi anemia
protein (FANCD2) through deubiquitylation and the
subsequent stabilization of checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1)
[44, 45]. Furthermore, USP1 controls proliferating
cell nuclear antigen ubiquitylation, a safeguard factor
against error-prone DNA translesion synthesis that is
ubiquitylated and responsible for genotoxic stress [46].
As a result, USP1 forms a complex with U2 small nuclear
ribonucleoparticle auxilliary factor 1 and promotes doublestrand break repair through homologous recombination
[47]. Moreover, DUB UCHL5 regulates DNA doublestrand breaks (DSBs) resection and repair by homologous
recombination through protecting its interactor, NFRKB,
from degradation [48]. Dub3 controls DNA damage
signaling by directly deubiquitinating H2AX [30]. Other
DUBs are implicated in the regulation of DNA repair.
Thus, BRCC36, Dub3, USP3, USP16, USP44 and OTUB1
participate in regulating the RNF8/RNF168 pathway of
double strand breaks repair [49], and USP5 links the
suppression of p53 and FAS levels in melanoma to the
BRAF pathway [50]. USP11 is involved in the cellular
response to mitomycin C-induced DNA damage within
the BRCA2 pathway signaling [51]. USP20 is a novel
regulator of ATR-dependent DNA damage [52]. USP20
serves as a novel regulator of ATR-dependent DNA

Signaling pathways
Recent studies have recognized the fact that
it is more important to focus on signaling pathway
rather than on individual genes altered in cancer [68].

the same cancer-relevant signaling pathway have been
demonstrated in many tumors and are known to have
similar functional effects, providing a wide range of drug
targets [69]. Some signaling pathways are recurrently
altered in many cancers, as those involving p53, NF-kB,
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), Wnt, transforming
growth factor-b (TGF-β) IFN and Akt, which are
significantly influenced by the activity of DUBs.

signaling by acting on several components of the pathway
[80]. A20 and CYLD regulate levels of ubiquitin related
to TRAF6. Furthermore, CYLD is also associated with
the deubiquitylation of TGF-B-activated kinase 1 [81],
B-cell CLL/lymphoma 3 (Bcl-3) [82] and mitogenactivated protein kinases [83], whereas A20 promotes
the degradation of TRAF2 in lysosomes by means of
its own E3 ligase activity [84]. A20 also potentiates
the proteasomal degradation of RIPK1 through Lys48
polyubiquitylation, whereas its OUT domain removes
Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains of RIPK1, leading to the
downregulation of NF-kB signaling [85]. The interactions
between CYLD and OTU deubiquitinases with linear
linkage specificity (OTULIN) and the linear ubiquitin
chain assembly complex (LUBAC ) ligase are involved in
controlling the extent of TNF-a-induced NF-kB activation
in cells by fine-tuning the generation of linear ubiquitin
chains by LUBAC [86]. MCPIP1 negatively controls
c-Jun N-terminal kinase and NF-kB activity through
deubiquitylation of TRAF2, TRAF3 and TRAF6, thus
playing an essential role in the regulation of inflammatory
signaling [87]. USP2 has been reported as a regulator
of TNFα-induced NF-kB signaling, and is required for
Ikb phosphorylation, NF-kB nuclear translocation and
NF-kB-dependent target genes expression [88]. USP4 also
plays an essential role in the downregulation of TNFainduced NF-kB activation through deubiquitylation of
TGF-b-activated kinase 1 [89]. Furthermore, OTUD5
deubiquitylates TRAF3 resulting in diminished type I
interferon and interleukin-10 responses [90]. Moreover,
USP15 stabilizes IkBa by inhibiting its degradation by the
proteasome [1] and USP11 interacts with IkB kinase a, an
inhibitor of NF-kB, upon induction by TNFα [1]. USP21
inhibits NF-kB activation through the deubiquitylation
of RIPK1 [91]. Likewise, Cezanne suppresses
NF-kB nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity
by deubiquitylating RIPK1 signaling intermediaries
and interacting with DJ-1 [92, 93]. USP34 silencing
spared upstream signaling but led to a more pronounced
degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα, and culminated
in an increased DNA binding activity of the transcription
factor [94].

The p53 signaling pathway
p53 is, a tumor suppressor that is well studied
because it has critical functions in maintaining cellular
homeostasis and is frequently mutated in most tumors
[70]. To date, research studies have reported many DUBs
that are associated with p53 regulation: USP2, USP4,
USP5, USP7, USP10 and USP29. USP7 is involved
in the dynamic regulation of the p53-MDM2 pathway
by controlling the stability of both p53 and MDM2, a
ubiquitin ligase that also contributes to the maintenance of
p53 ubiquitylation levels [71, 72]. Therefore, USP7 can be
regarded as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor depending
on whether it mainly deubiquitylates MDM2 or p53,
respectively. Similarly, USP2 influences the stabilization
of MDM2, but in contrast to USP7, does not deubiquitylate
p53 [73]. USP10 is also associated with regulation of p53
localization and stability, however, unlike USP2 and USP7,
it does not interact with MDM2 [74]. Otub1, a DUB from
the OTU-domain containing protease family abrogates
p53 ubiquitination and stabilizes and activates p53 in
cells independent of its deubiquitinating enzyme activity
[75]. Interestingly, USP10 can stabilize both mutated and
wild-type p53, thus having a dual role in tumorigenesis
depending on p53 status. Likewise, USP5 has been
identified as a potential target for p53 activating therapeutic
agents for the treatment of cancer [76]. Moreover, USP29
deubiquitylates and stabilizes p53 in response to oxidative
stress [77]. Furthermore, USP4 interacts directly with and
deubiquitinates ARF-BP1, leading to the stabilization of
ARF-BP1 and subsequent reduction of p53 levels [78].
Taken together with the finding that USP4-deficient
murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit retarded
growth, premature senescence, hyperactive DNA damage
checkpoints and resistance to oncogenic transformation,
thus suggesting that USP4 is a potential oncogene [78].

RTK signaling pathways
Recent studies have found that the relevance
of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated signal
transduction pathways (RTKs) in several human
tumor types is reflected by multiple abnormalities in
RTK-dependent pathways [95]. To date, numerous
oncogenic mechanisms are known to interfere with
RTK internalization. There are at least five DUBs:
USP8, USP17, USP18, AMSH and POH1-that affect
the trafficking of RTKs including epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), Met and ErbB2. USP8 has
an important role in the stabilization of RTKs through

The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) signaling
pathway
It is well-known that the nuclear factor-kappa
B (NF-kB) signaling pathway has multiple roles in
cancer progression including anti-apoptosis, cell cycle,
angiogenesis and metastasis [79]. Several DUBs  such
as A20, CYLD, MCPIP1, USP2, USP4, USP11,
USP15,USP21 and USP34 are involved in NF-kB

deubiquitylation, allowing their recycling to the plasma
membrane [96]. USP8 depletion might reflect the loss of
ESCRT-0 components which associate with the retromer
components Vps35 and SNX1, whereas failure to deliver
lysosomal enzymes efficiently might also contribute to the
observed block in receptor tyrosine kinase degradation
[97]. Furthermore, the endosome-associated AMSH (also
known as STAMBP) promotes EGFR recycling at the
expense of lysosomal sorting [98, 99]. Moreover, USP18
has been identified as a new regulator of EGFR synthesis
by controlling its translation [100]. Recent research has
shown that USP18 controls EGFR expression and cancer
cell survival depending on the transcriptional activation
and mRNA stabilization of miR-7 host genes [101].
Finally, another RNA interference screen has identified
POH1 as a regulator of ubiquitylated ErbB2 levels,
although it is not associated with its turnover [102].

early stages and promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition at later stages [111]. To date, many DUBs have
been reported to be involved in the regulation of the TGFβ
pathway, including USP4, USP11, USP15, USP18, USP9X
and CYLD. The UCH member UCH37, OTU members
A20 and OUTB1 and JAMM/JPN+ member AMSH,
are also reported to regulate the TGFβ pathway. USP9X
positively regulates TGF-β signaling by deubiquitylating
SMAD4 and promoting its association with SMAD2
[112]. USP9X regulates cell polarity and proliferation
and modulates their phosphorylation and activation by
LKB1 through deubiquitylation of the AMPK-related
kinases NUAK1 and MARK4 [113]. Finally, AMSHLP and UCHL5 promote TGF-β responses through their
interaction with inhibitory I-SMADs [113, 114].

The Wnt signaling pathway

The IFN immune system consists of type I, II, and
III IFNs, signals through the JAK-STAT pathway, and
plays a central role in host defense against viral infection.
Posttranslational modifications like ubiquitination regulate
diverse molecules in the IFN pathway. USP13 was the
first DUB identified to modulate STAT1 and play a role
in the antiviral activity of IFN against DEN-2 replication
[115]. USP2b negatively regulates IFN-β signaling and the
antiviral immune response by deubiquitinating K63-linked
polyubiquitin chains from TBK1 to terminate TBK1
activation [116].

The IFN pathway

The Wnt signaling pathway is required for
regulation of embryonic development and is frequently
activated in cancer [103]. To date, there are at least eight
DUBs involved in this pathway, including CYLD, USP4,
USP7, USP14, USP15, USP34, TRABID and OTULIN.
In fact, CYLD serves as a negative regulator of Wnt
signaling and β-catenin activation by deubiquitylating
the cytoplasmic effector Dishevelled (Dvl) [104]. USP4
negatively regulates Wnt signaling by interacting with
Nemolike kinase [105] and USP15 promotes β-catenin
degradation through the stabilization of adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC), a negative regulator of Wntmediated transcription [106]. USP7 interacts with RNF220
by stabilizing β-catenin, leading to the RNF220/USP7
complex deubiquitinating β-catenin and enhancing
canonical Wnt signaling [107]. USP14 functions as a
positive regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. Tissue
microarray analysis of colon cancer has consistently
revealed a strong correlation between the levels of USP14
and β-catenin, which suggests an oncogenic role for
USP14 via the enhancement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
[108]. In contrast, USP34 serves as a positive modulator
of Wnt signaling by inhibiting β-catenin-dependent
transcription [109]. Furthermore, TRABID is a DUB
that is critically involved in T-cell factor (TCF)-mediated
transcription of Wnt genes by deubiquitylating APC [110].
The interaction of HOIP with OTULIN is also involved
in OTULIN suppressing the canonical Wnt signaling
pathway activation by LUBAC [86].

The Akt pathway
USP12, in complex with Uaf-1 and WDR20, directly
deubiquitinates and stabilizes the Akt phosphatases
PHLPP and PHLPPL resulting in decreased levels of
active pAkt. Depleting USP12 sensitizes prostate cancer
cells to therapies aimed at Akt inhibition irrespective of
their sensitivity to androgen ablation therapy [117].

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION
Conclusively, there is accumulating experimental
evidence that a large number of DUBs play important role
in several stages of cancer development and progression.
The potential to influence processes including signal
transduction, proliferation and apoptosis by affecting
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of key
regulators is both promising and exciting. DUBs are
more likely drug candidates than E3 ligases due to the
lack of defined catalytic residues in the latter. Most DUBs
are cysteine enzymes, which should be easy to use as
target drugs, particularly if using compounds containing
Michael acceptors. Furthermore, many DUBs show
profound changes in their expression levels in different
malignant tumors. As a result, together with the recent
success of clinically targeting the ubiquitin proteasome

system in cancer, DUBs have emerged as appealing
targets in the development of novel specific therapies
against human malignancies. To date, no DUB-targeted
strategies have reached clinical trials and many challenges
remain before translating this information into clinical
benefits for cancer patients. In addition, DUBs could
be targeted for anticancer therapeutics. Early evidence
for antitumor efficacy with the currently available DUB
inhibitors is more than encouraging and sets the stage
for the development of selective, as well as partially
selective, small-molecule DUB inhibitors. Moreover,
the assignment of oncogenic or tumor-suppressive roles
to certain DUBs is still due to the cellular context and
further analysis will be required for functional and clinical
validation of DUBs as drug targets. Bioavailability is a
hurdle that needs to be overcome, but if progress can
be made in this area molecules containing functional
dienones as well as other types of compounds might be
developed into useful cancer therapeutics. Finally, the
generation of gain- or loss of- function animal models
for selected DUB family members will likely contribute
to clarify the relative relevance of individual DUBs and
their alterations in tumorigenic progression. Hopefully,
our review derived from many studies will provide novel
insights into the multiple questions associated with DUBs
and lead to the introduction of DUB-targeting therapy in
cancer treatments and crucial components of molecular
therapies against cancer.
