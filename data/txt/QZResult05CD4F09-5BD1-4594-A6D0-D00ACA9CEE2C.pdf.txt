ABSTRACT
The bispecific antibody is a novel antibody, which can target two different
antigens and mediate specific killing effects by selectively redirecting effector cells to
the target cells. Here, we designed and synthesized a bispecific antibody (BsAb) that
can bind cellular-mesenchymal to epithelial transition factor (c-MET, overexpressed
in several human solid tumor), and programmed death-1 (PD-1, involved in cancer
cell immune evasion) with high affinity and specificity. We found that BsAb can induce
the degradation of c-MET protein in cancer cells, including MKN45, a gastric cancer
cell line, and A549, a lung cancer cell line. BsAb inhibited hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF)-mediated proliferation, migration, and antiapoptosis, and downregulated
HGF-stimulated phosphorylation of c-MET, protein kinase B (AKT), and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). BsAb can also rescue T cell activation. Furthermore,
xenograft analysis revealed that BsAb markedly inhibits the growth of subcutaneously
implanted tumors and chronic inflammation. On the basis of these results, we have
identified a potential bispecific drug, which can effectively target c-MET and PD-1 for
the treatment of human solid cancers.

stimulate lymphangiogenesis, leading to lymph node
metastasis [11]. Consequently, c-MET has become a leading
target candidate for cancer therapy. Currently, commercial
c-MET inhibitors used in second-line treatment in phase
2 clinical trials significantly prolong progression time and
survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [12, 13].
However, several in vivo studies published showed that
some c-MET inhibitors carry potential side effects, such as
heart rate acceleration, cardiac muscle denaturation, renal
toxicity, and body weight reduction [14–16]. Following
clinical trials, monoclonal antibodies against growth factors
or their receptors have been approved for cancer therapy.
Nevertheless, targeting c-MET with monoclonal antibodies
has proved difficult because most antibodies have intrinsic
agonistic activity [17, 18].

INTRODUCTION
Cellular-mesenchymal to epithelial transition factor
(c-MET) is confirmed as the only high affinity receptor
that binds hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) [1], which
mediates cell morphogenesis, mitogenesis, angiogenesis,
and cytoprotection in vitro [2, 3]. c-MET is overexpressed
in a broad spectrum of human solid tumors [2, 4], and once
activated, promotes tumor progression, invasion, metastasis,
and angiogenesis [5]. c-MET is also overexpressed in
human glioblastomas, and expression levels correlate
with glioma malignancy grade and vascularity, promoting
glioma growth and angiogenesis in vivo [5–10]. Activation
of the HGF/c-MET pathway in various solid tumors can

Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is an immunoglobulin
superfamily member expressed on activated and exhausted
T cells, which can also recruit regulatory T (Treg) cells [19].
Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), the primary ligand
for PD-1, is broadly expressed by most cell types, including
dendritic cells (DCs), as well as by tumor cells [20–22].
Upon ligation, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway recruits Src
homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2) to
control peripheral tolerance [19, 23]. PD-L1 is upregulated
in the tumor microenvironment in response to inflammatory
stimuli, and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway can inhibit T cellmediated anti-tumor responses [23, 24]. Monoclonal
antibodies blocking coinhibitory immune checkpoint
receptors (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1) show remarkable efficacy
against many cancers. For example, anti-PD-1 antibody
produced objective clinical responses in approximately 2025% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
melanoma, and renal-cell cancer [25, 26], and anti-PD-1/
PD-L1 showed objective responses in NSCLC as a
monotherapy, with evidence for markedly increased overall
survival in second-line treatment reported in patients with
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [27–30].
Recently, the FDA approved two agents blocking PD-1
(nivolumab and pembrolizumab) for the treatment of
metastatic melanoma [31, 32]. Ipilimumab, a monoclonal
antibody that works to activate the immune system by
targeting CTLA-4, combined with nivolumab attained
intense and synergistic therapeutic effects in the treatment
of a deadly form of skin cancer [33–34]. Ipilimumab
combined with chemotherapy showed a modest degree of
clinical activity in the treatment of patients with metastatic
NSCLC [35]. However, it has to be noted that systemic
administration of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies carries
potential side effects, such as persistent high fever and
breakdown of peripheral tolerance [36].

In the present study, a novel targeted c-MET and
PD-1 BsAb was developed in our laboratory, that can bind
human c-MET and PD-1 with high affinity and specificity,
and induce the degradation of c-MET in multiple cancer
cell types, including MKN45, a gastric cancer cell line, and
A549, a lung cancer cell line. Our BsAb can inhibit HGFinduced growth and migration of c-MET-addicted tumor
cells, promote the apoptosis of tumor cells, and rescue IL-2
secretion of Jurkat T cells. BsAb can also inhibit HGFstimulated c-MET autophosphorylation of Tyr1234/1235 in
the activation loop, which activates downstream molecules,
such as protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK). We have further identified that our
BsAb could potently inhibit tumor growth and inflammatory
factor secretion in vivo, implicating its immunotherapeutic
potential in human solid tumor treatment.

RESULTS
Expression of c-MET and PD-L1 by tumor cells
First, we evaluated c-MET and PD-L1 mRNA
expression in eight human cancer cell lines using realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). All
eight cell lines expressed c-MET at a relative high levels,
but only four (MKN45, MDA-MB-231, A549, and IM95)
expressed PD-L1 at a relative high levels (Figure 1A). Next,
we detected c-MET protein expression by western blot. The
results showed that all eight cancer cell lines also expressed
c-MET protein at a relative high levels (Figure 1B). Finally,
we determined whether the above eight cancer cell lines can
produce xenografts in NOD/SCID mice. Three of the eight
cell lines produced xenografts well (MKN45, A549, and
IM95) (data not shown), hence, MKN45 and A549 cell lines
were selected for use in this study, both of which express

c-MET rescued apoptosis in renal cancer cells [37],
and inhibition of c-MET signaling increased mitochondrial
release of cytochrome C and the Bax/Bcl2 ratio [38]. We
therefore evaluated the effect of BsAb on c-MET-mediated
signaling in the regulation of cancer cell death. Tumor cells
were treated with BsAb for 8 h or JNJ for 2 h, and then
treated with combinations of HGF and rapamycin (RAPA)
for 48 h. Cells were stained with annexin V and propidium
iodide (PI), and analyzed by flow cytometry to measure the
apoptotic index. HGF significantly rescued RAPA-induced
cellular apoptosis (Figure 2C, left), with a reduction from
20.67% to 9.43% in MKN45 cells; nevertheless, our BsAb
markedly inhibited this effect. With BsAb pre-treatment,
the percentage of RAPA-induced apoptotic MKN45 cells
increased from 9.43% to 17.17%. JNJ produced the same
effect as BsAb, and the same phenomenon was shown in
A549 cells (Figure 2C, right). Altogether, our results indicate

BsAb inhibits HGF-stimulated cancer cell
proliferation, migration, and antiapoptosis
Our BsAb has two targets, and can block c-MET and
PD-1. To test the effect of BsAb targeting of c-MET on
tumor cells growth, tumor cells were treated with or without
BsAb for 8 h and JNJ 38877605 (JNJ, a known c-MET
inhibitor) for 2 h before HGF treatment. Cell viability was
then measured using the MTS assay. BsAb significantly
inhibited cancer cell growth, and had the same effect as
JNJ (Figure 2A). In migration assays, BsAb significantly
inhibited MKN45 and A549 cells migration (Figure 2B). The
same effect was observed in JNJ treated group (Figure 2B).

inhibitor of cancer development, via c-MET targeting.

BsAb promotes IL-2 production by Jurkat T
cells

BsAb inhibits HGF-triggered c-MET
downstream molecules and promotes c-MET
degradation

Cytokine secretion is an important criterion for
evaluating T cell function. To assess the effect of MKN45
and A549 cell expression of PD-L1 on T cell function,
Jurkat T cells were cocultured with IFN-γ-pretreated
MKN45 and A549 cells at different E:T proportions in
the presence of PHA for 48 h, and then tested for IL-2
production by ELISA. Jurkat T cells were shown to
express PD-1 at low levels, however, approximately 36%
of Jurkat T cells expressed PD-1 after stimulation with
PHA (1 μg/mL) for 48 h (Figure 5A). The relative mRNA
expression of PD-L1 upregulated with IFN-γ stimulation
for 48 h (Figure 5B).
MKN45 and A549 cells cocultured with Jurkat T
cells at an E:T of 5:1 significantly reduced Jurkat T cell
IL-2 production (Figure 5C, 5F). In a co-culture system,
MKN45 and A549-associated inhibition of IL-2 secretion
was shown to be cell-contact-dependent; IL-2 levels were
significantly inhibited in Jurkat T cells cocultured in
contact with MKN45 and A549 cells (P<0.01), compared
to those in separated coculture. At the same time, the
transwell coculture of cancer cells and Jurkat T cells also
inhibited the secretion of IL-2 at lower levels (Figure 5D,
5G).

The HGF/c-MET signal pathway plays a significant
role in tumor development and metastasis [39], often
through activation of downstream molecules, including
AKT and ERK1/2 pathways. In the present study, we
found that HGF-mediated upregulation of p-c-MET in
MKN45 and A549 cells was completely inhibited with
BsAb treatment, even more profoundly efficiency than
JNJ treatment (Figure 3). Upregulation of p-AKT was
observed in response to HGF stimulation that was also
inhibited by BsAb and JNJ. Furthermore, upregulation of
p-ERK1/2 was also inhibited by BsAb and JNJ treatment.
Quercetin and anti-c-MET antibodies can inhibit
HGF/c-MET signaling by promoting c-MET protein
degradation [40]. To clarify whether BsAb could induce
c-MET degradation, western blot analysis was performed
to assess c-MET stability. BsAb strongly downregulated
c-MET protein expression in both dose- and timedependent manners in the two cancer cell lines (Figure
4A, 4B). However, there was no effect on c-MET mRNA
expression, assessed by qPCR (Figure 4C, 4D). These
results suggest that the AKT and ERK1/2 pathways play
an essential role in cancer cell proliferation, migration,

In order to verify that the cell-contact-dependent
inhibition of IL-2 secretion was due to PD-L1:PD-1
interaction, BsAb or IgG4 controls were added to the
coculture systems. BsAb restored the secretion of IL-2 by
Jurkat T cells by more than 40%. However, addition of
IgG4 control had no effect on IL-2 secretion by Jurkat T
cells (Figure 5E, 5H).
From above results, we concluded that our BsAb
can restore cytokine secretion by activated T cells, via
interaction with PD-1, which may occur by blocking the
PD-L1:PD-1 pathway.

increase binding specificity by interacting with two
different cellular surface antigens instead of one [41].
BsAb are a promising way of enhancing anti-tumor
immunity in immunotherapy with the goal of achieving
synergistic effects. BsAb can interfere with multiple
surface receptors or ligands associated with cancer cell
proliferation or inflammatory processes. For example,
BsAb simultaneously targeting EGFRx c-MET produced
synergies that inhibited tumor proliferation and metastasis
more effectively [42–44]. With the development of genetic
engineering utilizing recombinant DNA technology, more
than 30 BsAbs have so far been exploited in a clinical
setting. Currently, two of the front-runners have been
approved for the market by the FDA for the treatment
of pro-B cell acute lymphocyte leukemia (ALL) and
malignant ascites, and several more are in clinical trials
[45, 46].
A novel, targeted c-MET and PD-1 humanized
bispecific monoclonal antibody was developed in our
laboratory, which can bind both c-MET and PD-1 cellular
surface antigens with high affinity and specificity.
Theoretically, our BsAb could inhibit tumor progression,
migration, metastasis, and angiogenesis by blocking
c-MET, and can also rescue systemic T cell function by
blocking PD-1 in cancer cells overexpressing c-MET and
PD-L1. Moreover, our BsAb could form a bridge between
T cells and tumor cells, allowing the T cells to target the
tumor cells directly.
Previous attempts to target c-MET with antibodies
have met with difficulty, because most antibodies have
intrinsic agonistic activity [47, 48], and the effects
of individual antibodies were minimal. The divalent
structure of antagonistic antibodies directed to c-MET
often activates c-MET signaling pathway via receptor
dimerization and cross-activation, which appear to
function as agonists. Recently, however, a novel onearmed variant of the c-MET antibody 5D5 (OA5D5)
was developed by Genentech (South San Francisco,
CA), which acts as a pure antagonist, and can inhibit
the growth of cells dependent on HGF/c-MET autocrine
and paracrine signaling, and inhibit glioma growth in an
orthotopic model in vivo [49, 50]. The monovalent format
antibodies proved to be necessary against the agonistic
activity [51]. In the present study, we have successfully
developed a novel BsAb targeting c-MET and PD-1, using
monovalent forms of anti-c-MET and anti-PD-1, which
can avoid inducing c-MET receptor dimerization, and the
intrinsic agonistic activity, just as OA5D5 can.
In vitro, our BsAb inhibited HGF-induced growth
and migration of c-MET-addicted tumor cells (Figure
2A, 2B), and promoted apoptosis in tumor cells (Figure
2C), even more effectively than JNJ, a known c-MET
inhibitor. BsAb also inhibited HGF-stimulated c-MET
autophosphorylation of Tyr1234/1235 in the activation
loop, which activates downstream molecules, such as
AKT and ERK1/2 (Figure 3). It is well known that

BsAb inhibits tumor development and
inflammatory cytokine secretion in vivo
Finally, we evaluated the effect of BsAb on
tumor development by heterotopic xenograft analysis
in vivo. NOD/SCID mice were subcutaneously injected
with MKN45 cells. After 7 days, BsAb and IgG4 were
administered twice a week for 3 weeks. PBMC were
injected the first and fourth time drugs were administered
through the tail vein. BsAb significantly inhibited MKN45induced tumor growth compared to IgG4, reducing the
tumor volume by nearly 60% (Figure 6A), and inhibited
tumor weight by approximately 50% (Figure 6B). The
body weight change of mice was not significant difference
(data not shown). Moreover, immunohistochemical
analysis showed that BsAb significantly reduced Ki67, VEGF-A, and MMP-9 staining (Figure 6C), which
indicates it may inhibit cell proliferation, angiogenesis,
and metastasis in vivo. In addition, we found that BsAb
reduced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in vivo
(including IL-6, but not TNF-α) compared with control
mice (Figure 6D), which suggests that BsAb treatment can
inhibit chronic inflammation in vivo.

BsAb inhibits tumor development beyond PD-1
antibody blockade in vivo
The therapeutic efficacy of BsAb against MKN45
cell xenograft tumors was explored, and compared with
PD-1 antibody and a one arm c-MET antibody. Mice were
treated with IgG4, BsAb, PBMC iv + PD-1 ip antibody,
or PBMC iv + BsAb ip. As shown in Figure 7A, PBMC
+ BsAb treatment significantly inhibited tumor size
compared to treatment with BsAb alone (P=0.005), or
PBMC + PD-1antibody (P=0.037). These data collectively
suggest BsAb is a more potent inhibitor of tumor growth
in vivo than PD-1 or one arm c-MET antibody.

DISCUSSION
BsAb can redirect specific immune cells to tumor
cells to enhance tumor killing, enablethe simultaneous
blocking of two different antigens that exert unique or
overlapping roles in pathogenesis, and can potentially

phosphorylated AKT and ERK1/2 are the two major
c-MET downstream oncogenic signaling proteins [52].
PI3K/AKT signaling activation, shown to mediate
essential anti-apoptosis signals, has also been reported to
be critical for cell dissociation [53, 54], and p38MAPK,
along with ERK1/2, promoted HGF-mediated cornea
epithelial cell migration [55]. Therefore, we could
conclude that BsAb inhibits the pathways of c-MET,
including AKT and ERK1/2, which may contribute to the
antigrowth, antimigration, and proapoptosis effects. At
the same time, analysis of the effect of BsAb on c-MET
protein levels suggests that BsAb can induce protein
degradation, in both dose- and time-dependent manners,
in cancer cells (including MKN45 and A549 cells). We
also found that BsAb didn’t affect the c-MET mRNA
expression levels in the two cell lines (Figure 4C, 4D),
which suggested that the c-MET protein degradation may
result from BsAb-mediated receptor internalization in
post-transcription. However, the molecular mechanisms
by which pathways promote BsAb-mediated degradation
of c-MET protein require further clarification in cancer
cells. In sum, these data support the conclusion that BsAb
neutralizes c-MET activation, not only by blocking c-MET
downstream oncogenic signaling activation, but also by
reducing c-MET protein levels.
Effectively activated tumor reactive T cells, and
suppressed checkpoint inhibitors, have resulted in prolonged
tumor regression and improved overall response rates
in melanoma, renal cell cancers, and lung cancers [56].
Recently, immunotherapy by checkpoint blockade directed
against the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has shown remarkable
antitumor responses in patients with advanced melanoma,
lung cancer, and other cancers with durable clinical
responses [23, 25, 57, 58]. T cells activated in the absence
of PD-L1/PD-1 costimulation are functionally activated,
and produce higher levels of Th1 cytokines, in particular IL2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ [59]. IFN-γ could upregulate PD-L1
expression on many cell lines. In our study, we described,
for the first time, a new approach to inhibit PD-1/PD-L1
costimulation by directly targeting PD-1 expression in
Jurkat T cells using our BsAb. We observed that Jurkat T
cells express PD-1 at low levels, but approximately 36%
of Jurkat T cells expressed PD-1 after stimulation with
PHA for 48 h (Figure 5A), and we have also observed that
MKN45 and A549 cells retained remarkably upregulation
PD-L1expression when stimulated with IFN-γ (Figure 5B).
The results showed that our BsAb can significantly rescue
Jurkat T cell IL-2 production, which is a key cytokine
indispensable to the proliferation and survival of activated
T cells. In addition, cancer cells pretreated with IFN-γ
obviously inhibited IL-2 secretion by Jurkat T cells. It is well
known that cancer cells might encounter IFN-γ produced by
activated T cells in the tumor’s local microenvironment,
and thus could respond by upregulating PD-L1 on their cell
membrane to suppress T cell secretion of IL-2. Our results
demonstrate that BsAb can rescue PD-L1/PD-1-mediated
inhibition of IL-2 in a tumor microenvironment, which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

may play an important role in activating effector T cells by
blocking PD-L1/PD-1 signaling.
At the end of the study, we examined the effect
of our novel humanized BsAb on tumor growth in vivo
using a xenograft model. Our results demonstrated
that BsAb effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo,
it reduced the tumor volume and weight near 60%
(Figure 6A, 6B). We also found that BsAb can reduce
the expression of proliferation, angiogenesis, migration,
and invasion-related proteins, including Ki-67, VEGF-A,
and MMP-9, which indicates its potent ability to inhibit
cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, and
invasion in vivo. TNF-α, and IL-6 are produced in
the microenvironment of the tumor as a result of the
nonspecific inflammatory response, which appears to
increase c-MET expression [60]. Further investigation
showed that BsAb could strongly inhibit inflammatory
factor production in vivo compared with control mice,
including IL-6, although TNF-α was not reduced by
BsAb, which may alleviate chronic inflammation during
the progress of tumor treatment.
Our BsAbs can simultaneously bind human c-MET
and PD-1 with high affinity and specificity, which should
achieve synergistic effects. In this study, we found that
BsAb + PBMC treatment is superior to anti-PD-1 +
PBMC treatment at inhibiting tumor growth in vivo
(Figure 7A) (P=0.037). We also explored the effect of
c-MET antibody in the inhibition of tumor growth in
vivo, however, it proved difficult (data not shown), which
might be due to intrinsic agonistic activity. NOD/SCID
mice are deficient of humanized PD-1 highly expressing
T cells, so our BsAb targeting the PD-1 pathway may be
useless in treating mice alone. In order to simulate c-MET
antibody effects, BsAb was used alone in treating NOD/
SCID mice, which may simulate a monovalent form of
c-MET antibody, similar to OA5D5. The results showed
that BsAb + PBMC treatment is superior to BsAb alone
at inhibiting tumor growth in vivo (P=0.005) (Figure 7A,
7B). At the same time, the safety of c-MET/PD-1 BsAb
in HUVEC cell viability was done by MTS assay. There
were no significant difference between BsAb and IgG4
treatment (Supplementary Figure 1).
Nevertheless, our study did not directly address
the effects of BsAb comparing with one-armed c-MET
antibody in vivo. Only through comparing with the
antibody, could we conclude that the BsAb is indeed
superior to the one-armed c-MET antibody. Further
studies are necessary to explore the hypothesized
superiority of BsAb over c-MET antibody in vitro and in
vivo. In addition, our observation of BsAb treatment was
only limited to c-MET and PD-L1-positive tumor cells,
however, we do not know whether BsAb has effects in
c-MET and PD-L1-negative tumor cells. In order to obtain
large numbers of humanized PD-1 highly expressing T
cells, reconstituting the immune systems, human PBMC
were transplanted into NOD/SCID mice by tail vein
injection. However, the mice may have developed host

versus graft disease (HVGD), which may influence the
effect of BsAb treatment in mice.
In conclusion, BsAb treatment strongly inhibited the
growth of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, more effectively
than PD-1 antibody or simulated one-armed c-MET
antibody. Mechanisms responsible for this antitumor
effect include inhibition of tumor cell proliferation,
migration, angiogenesis, and proinflammatory cytokine
secretion, as well as proapoptotic effects, which may block
c-MET downstream signaling in the AKT and ERK1/2
signaling pathways, and the PD-L1/PD-1 signaling
pathway. Therefore, our studies identified BsAb to be a
potential antitumor agent that may be able to effectively
complement immunotherapy strategies in future.

Master Mix (KAPA). The primer pairs used were: c-MET,
forward 5’-TTC-ACC-GCG-GAA-ACA-CCC-ATC-3’,
reverse 5’-GTC-TTC-CAG-CCA-GGC-CCA-3’; PD-L1,
forward 5’-TGG-CAT-TTG-CTG-AAC-GCA-TTT3’,
reverse 5’-GTG-GTG-GTC-TTA-CCA-CTC-AGG3’;
GAPDH, forward 5’-CAT-CTC-TGC-CCC-CTC-TGCTGA-3’, reverse 5’-GGA-TGA-CCT-TGC-CCA-CAGCCT-3’. ΔCT (cycle threshold) values were calculated
based on the mean CT values of the target genes and mean
CT values of the reference control gene GAPDH, using
the following formula: ΔCT = Mean CT for Target Gene
– Mean CT for GAPDH. Relative gene expression levels
were calculated using ΔΔCT analysis. ΔΔCT = ΔCT of
Sample – ΔCT of Calibrator. Relative Gene Expression
= 2-(ΔΔCT).

Cell lines and cell culture conditions

Cell viability and apoptosis assay

MKN45, A549, HT-29, MDA-MB-231, 769P, and
Jurkat T cells were obtained from the ATCC; IM95 cell
line was obtained from JCRB Cell Bank; HN30 was a gift
from the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial-Head and
Neck Oncology (Shanghai Jiao Tong University School
of Medicine, China); Human uveal melanoma 92.1 was a
gift from the Institute of Eye Vision, Shanghai Jiao Tong
University School of Medicine. HN30, 92.1, MKN45,
A549, HT-29, MDA-MB-231, 769P, and IM95 were
cultured in DMEM (IM95 containing 1% insulin) and
Jurkat T cells cultured in RPMI- 1640 supplemented with
10% FBS (GIBCO) and of 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(GIBCO). Cells were incubated at a 37°C humidified
incubator containing 5% CO2.

Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 1×104 each
hole overnight and were grown in the presence of IgG4
(control) and BsAb for 8 h and JNJ for 2 h, then were
treated with HGF. After 3 day, 20 μl MTS (Sango, China)
was added to each sample and incubated for 4 h. The
absorbance of solution was recorded at 490 nm with a
thermo microplate reader. The results of the MTS assay to
reflect cell viability.
Apoptotic cells were measured by flow cytometry
as follows: cells were harvested and washed with PBS,
resuspended in pre-diluted binding buffer, and stained with
annexinV-FITC (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) for 30 min
at room temperature. After being washed and resuspended
in PI binding buffer, the cells were immediately subjected
to apoptosis analyses by flow cytometry using Cell Quest
Software.

Reagents and antibodies

In vitro scratch wound healing migration assay

Human recombinant HGF, PHA, and IFN-γ were
purchased from GenScript (Nanjing, China). The c-MET
kinase inhibitors JNJ38877605 and rapamycin were
obtained from Selleckchem (Houston, TX). Antibodies
used include: c-MET mAb (#8198), phospho-MET
(Tyr1234/1235) mAb (#3077), AKT mAb (#9272),
phospho-AKT (Ser473) mAb (#4060), p44/42 MAP kinase
mAb (#4696), phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr202/
Tyr204) mAb (#4376), GAPDH mAb (#2118). Anti-mouse
IgG, HRP-linked antibody (#7076), anti-human IgG4 was
used as control, HRP-linked antibody (#7074) were used as
secondary antibodies. All antibodies were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. PE-labled mouse antihuman PD-1antibody was purchased from Abcam.

MKN45 or A549 cells were plated in a 6-well plate.
After overnight a sterile 10 μl pipette tip was used to
make a wound across a cell culture monolayer. Cells were
incubated in DMEM-0% FBS in the presence of BsAb for
8 h and JNJ for 2 h, then were treated with HGF (100
ng/mL). Multiple photographs of the wound were taken
immediately after wounding 0 h and 24 h under a phasecontrast microscopy. The efficiency of the wound healing
process was determined by calculating the area of the
cell gap at the indicated times (0 and 24 h), using ImageJ
software. Three random images were used for each wound
at each experimental point. The results are expressed as
percentage of healing at 24 h with respect to zero time.

Extraction (Pierce). Proteins were quantified by the BCA
Protein Assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Samples containing a total of 50 μg protein
were incubated at 100°C for 5 min, separated by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subsequently
electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane. Essential component detection in the cells was
performed with antibody at overnight incubation at 4°C,
and then HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000
dilution; Pierce Chemical) was added for 1 h at room
temperature, followed by the development of reactions in
a chemiluminescent detection system. GAPDH antibody
was used as the control.

-80°C for further analyses. Mice were then sacrificed for
the collection of tumors.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Tumor samples were fixed in 4% formalin,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 4-μm-thickness
slices. After dewaxing, tissues sections were processed
by antigen retrieval, followed by the quenching of
endogenous peroxidase activity using hydrogen
peroxide. PBS (0.1% Tween 20) containing anti-goat
serum was used to block non-specific binding sites.
Slides were incubated with polyclonal antibodies against
Ki-67 or VEGF-A or MMP-9 (in 1:100 dilution, CST,
US). After washing with PBS, slides were incubated
with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody followed by
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. After
developing in DAB substrates (Invitrogen, US), 5 highmagnification fields were randomly selected in each
slide, and the numbers of positive cells in each field
were counted (each group=4) by the image analysis
system (Image-Pro Plus).

Human PBMC preparation and transplantation
Blood from healthy volunteers was collected in
heparinized tubes. For the isolation of PBMCs, blood
was diluted 1:1 with RPMI1640 medium (vol/vol)
prior to transferring into the leucosep tube. Following
centrifugation (20 min, 2000 rpm), the PBMC layer was
pooled and transferred into a 15 ml falcon tube. The
sample was washed with 10 ml phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and centrifuged again for 10 min at 1500 rpm. The
obtained cell pellet was resuspended in PBS. A total of
1×108 PBMCs per mouse were injected into NOD/SCID
mice through tail vein for the reconstitution of immune
system.

ELISA
The cytokines levels of IL-2 (culture supernatants),
TNF-a, and IL-6 (mice serum) were measured using
the specific ELISA kits (R&D Systems) following the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Tumor xenograft study

Statistical analysis

Approximately 5- to 6-week male NOD/SCID
mice (about 20 g) were obtained from SLAC Laboratory
Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and were kept in a
specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility. They are absent of T,
B lymphocytes, and NK cells. All animal treatment were
in accordance with international ethics guidelines and the
National Institutes of Health Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. This study was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Fudan University.
MKN45 cells (5×106cells) were subcutaneously injected
into the right flank region of mice. After 7 days,
allowing the tumors to grow to about 50 mm3, mice
were randomized into control and treatment groups. For
MKN45 xenograft, mice were treated as follows: BsAb
(10 mg/kg, twice per week), IgG4 and anti-PD-1 (5 mg/
kg, twice per week); PBMCs (1×108) were injected the
first and fourth time drugs were administered through
via tail vein. Each group consisted of 5-6 mice. At the
same time, body weight and tumor size were measured
using an electronic balance and a vernier caliper. Tumor
volume was calculated using the formula: volume =
(length × width2))×0.5. After the endpoint (28 days after
the implantation), blood was collected from the aorta
abdominalis and the serum was separated and frozen at
