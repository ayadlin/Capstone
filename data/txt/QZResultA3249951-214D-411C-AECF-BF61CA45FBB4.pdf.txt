ABSTRACT
In proliferating cells, mTOR is active and promotes cell growth. When the cell cycle
is arrested, then mTOR converts reversible arrest to senescence (geroconversion).
Rapamycin and other rapalogs suppress geroconversion, maintaining quiescence
instead. Here we showed that ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors (Torin1 and
PP242), which inhibit both mTORC1 and TORC2, also suppressed geroconversion.
Despite inhibition of proliferation (in proliferating cells), mTOR inhibitors preserved
re-proliferative potential (RP) in arrested cells. In p21-arrested cells, Torin 1
and PP242 detectably suppressed geroconversion at concentrations as low as
1-3 nM and 10-30 nM, reaching maximal gerosuppression at 30 nM and 300 nM,
respectively. Near-maximal gerosuppression coincided with inhibition of p-S6K(T389)
and p-S6(S235/236). Dual mTOR inhibitors prevented senescent morphology and
hypertrophy. Our study warrants investigation into whether low doses of dual mTOR
inhibitors will prolong animal life span and delay age-related diseases. A new class
of potential anti-aging drugs can be envisioned.

INTRODUCTION

It is difficult to predict the outcome of life-long
administration of dual mTOR inhibitors in animals. On
one hand, they inhibit both rapamycin-sensitive and
-insensitive functions of mTOR and thus might extend life
span extensively. Yet, the role of rapamycin-insensitive
functions in aging is unknown. Furthermore, potential
toxicity due to lack of selectivity toward TOR may
preclude antiaging effects. Fortunately, a simple cellular
model is available to investigate anti-aging activity in cell
culture. In proliferating cells, mTOR is active and drives
cellular growth. When the cell cycle is forcefully arrested,
but mTOR is still active (as in proliferating cells), then
mTOR drives “senescence” [49, 50].
In other words, mTOR drives conversion from
reversible cell cycle arrest to senescence (geroconversion)
and rapamycin suppresses or decelerates geroconversion
[51-79].
Senescent cells cannot restart proliferation (reproliferation), even when the arrest is lifted and cells
re-enter the cell cycle. In the presence of active mTOR,
p21- or p16-arrested cells lose their re-proliferative
potential (RP). In the presence of rapamycin [54, 55, 62]
and everolimus [61], cells maintain RP during cell cycle

Aging is driven by conservative genetic pathways
[1-21]. These pathways converge at TOR (target of
rapamycin) [22-26]. Allosteric mTOR inhibitors known
as rapalogs such as rapamycin (Sirolimus), everolimus,
deforolimus and temsirolimus are available in the clinic
[27-33].
Rapamycin and other rapalogs inhibit some, but
not all, mTOR functions [34-43]. Rapalogs bind FKBP12
and this complex in turn inhibits mTOR complex 1
(mTORC1). In most conditions, rapamycin does not
inhibit mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Inhibition of
phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates by rapamycin
is concentration-dependent [41]. At clinicallyrelevant concentrations, rapamycin does not inhibit
phosphorylation of 4EBP1 at T37/46, while inhibiting
S6K/ S6 pathway [34-44]. In contrast, direct inhibitors
of the TOR kinase (non-rapalogs) abrogate all activities
of mTORC1 and mTORC2 [39, 45-48]. These ATPcompetitive inhibitors of the TOR kinase are not selective
and at higher concentrations inhibit PI3K, ATM and some
other kinases.

arrest and can re-proliferate, when the arrest is lifted. Also,
rapalogs moderately suppress cellular hypertrophy and
beta-Gal-positive senescent morphology. Here we tested
whether non-rapalog mTOR inhibitors such as Torin 1 and
PP242 can suppress geroconversion.

PP242 (Fig. 1A). We also tested deforolimus, a rapalog
also known as ridaforolimus. To measure cytostatic
effects, proliferating HT-p21 cells were treated with these
inhibitors (Fig. 1). After a 3-day treatment, drugs were
washed out and cells were incubated in fresh medium
for another 3-6 days. Colonies were stained with Crystal
Violet. TOR inhibitors decreased size of colonies but
not their number. This is consistent with reversible
inhibition of proliferation in the presence of inhibitors
(Fig. 1). Cells retained their re-proliferative potential and
resumed proliferation when the inhibitors were removed.
Therefore, the number of colonies remained the same as
in control but their size became progressively smaller
with increasing concentrations of inhibitors (Fig.1, see

RESULTS
mTOR inhibitors suppress geroconversion
We compared gerosuppressive and anti-proliferative
(cytostatic) effects of dual mTOR inhibitors, Torin 1 and

Figure 1: Cytostatic and gerosuppressive effects. A. Schema of experiment; B. Cytostatic and gerosupressive effects of deforolimus,

Torin 1 and PP242 in HT-p21 cells. Cells were treated with serial dilutions of deforolimus, PP242 or Torin 1 as depicted in schema in (A).
To determine cytostatic activity, cells were treated with drugs for 3 days, then drugs were washed out and cells were allowed to recover in
drug-free medium. Colonies were stained after 5 days of regrowth. To investigate drug effects on geroconversion, HT-p21 cells were treated
with IPTG in the presence of serial dilutions of the drugs. After 3-day treatment, drugs were washed out and colonies were allowed to form
for 9 days, then stained and counted in triplicates. Data are mean ± SD.

“cytostatic” panels).
To investigate effects of the drugs on
geroconversion, we induced ectopic p21 in HT-p21 cells
by treating them with IPTG [62, 80, 81]. These cells
undergo senescence when p21 is turned on by IPTG and
lose their re-proliferative potential (RP). When IPTG is
washed out, the senescent cells can re-enter the cell cycle
but cannot proliferate [63].
Suppression of geroconversion was evaluated
by the ability of IPTG-treated HT-p21 cells to
resume proliferation after IPTG was removed (Fig. 1,
gerosuppression). Treatment with IPTG alone decreased
the number of colonies, (Fig. 1B; no drug). This is
consistent with irreversible senescence in most IPTGtreated cells, so only a few cells were quiescent and
retained RP. Treatment of IPTG-arrested cells with
deforolimus, Torin 1 or PP242 increased the number of
colonies. These colony-forming cells were in quiescent
state and retained potential to re-proliferate. Cells resumed
proliferation once IPTG and drugs were removed. In
summary, the effects of mTOR inhibitors on proliferation
(cytostatic effect) and re-proliferative potential

(gerosuppressive effect) were opposite. While decreasing
the size of colonies in first case, mTOR inhibitors
increased the number of colonies in second case (Fig. 1B).
At concentrations shown in Figure 1B,
gerosuppressive effect of Torin 1 was maximal at
the lowest concentration shown (100 nM). At higher
concentrations (> 300 nM), the gerosuppressive effect
of Torin 1 was partially lower (Torin 1 partially canceled
its gerosuppressive effect) and colonies became smaller.
Therefore, we next titrated concentrations down (Fig.
2A). IPTG-arrested HT-p21 cells were treated with
a range of concentrations from 1 nM to 3000 nM,
according to experimental schema shown in Fig. 1A.
Gerosuppressive effect of Torin 1 was shifted toward
lower concentrations compared to that of PP242 (Fig. 2A).
Minimal concentrations that suppressed geroconversion
were 1 nM and 10 nM for Torin 1 and PP242, respectively.
Maximum effects of Torin 1 and PP242 were observed at
concentrations 30 nM and 300 nM, respectively, indicating
that Torin 1 is overall 10 times more potent than PP242.
Therefore, 10-fold lower concentrations of Torin 1 than
PP242 could be used to achieve equipotent effect.

cells, as shown in Figure 1A. Cells plated at low density were treated with IPTG in the presence of serial dilutions of inhibitors. After 3
days, IPTG and inhibitors were washed out and cells were incubated in drug-free medium. Then colonies were stained with Crystal Violet
and counted. Data are mean number of colonies per a sector of a well ± SD. B. Immunoblot analysis. HT-p21 cells were treated with IPTG
in combination with Torin 1 or PP242 for 24 h and lysed. Rapamycin (R) at 500 nM was included as additional control. Immunoblotting
was performed with the indicated antibodies. Note: IPTG-induced p21 is highly expressed in all samples, confirming that the inhibitors do
not interfere with p21 induction by IPTG and cell cycle arrest.

Correlation between gerosuppression and mTOR
inhibition

Finally, like rapamycin, Torin 1 and PP242 did
not decrease p21 levels, so they did not abrogate IPTGinduced arrest. At equipotent concentrations both mTOR
inhibitors decreased cyclin D1, a marker of senescent
hyper-mitogenic cell cycle arrest [63]. Hyper-elevated
cyclin D1 is a common marker of senescent phenotype
[63].

We next investigated inhibition of the mTOR
pathway by Torin 1 and PP242. Consistent with
gerosuppressive effects (Fig. 2A), Torin 1 inhibited
phosphorylation of S6 kinase (target of mTORC1) and its
downstream target phospho-S6 at concentrations 10 times
lower than PP242 (Fig. 2B). The inhibition of the S6K/S6
axis corresponded to concentrations at which preservation
of RP (gerosuppression) was observed. The S6K/S6 axis
is a major target of rapamycin.
At higher concentrations, at which gerosuppression
was already near-maximal, Torin 1 and PP242 exerted
rapamycin-resistant effects: namely, inhibition of
phosphorylation of 4EBP1 (T37/46) and Akt (S473).
Equipotent concentrations were approximately 10 times
higher for PP242 than for Torin 1.

mTOR kinase inhibitors prevent senescent
morphology
Treatment with IPTG resulted in a large flat cell
morphology and beta-Gal-positivity (Fig.3A). Enlarged
cell size was due to hypertrophy as indicated by increased
amount of protein per cell (Fig. 3B, compare control and
IPTG). Torin 1 or PP242 prevented senescent morphology
and decreased cell size. As it has been previously
shown, rapamycin partially decreased beta-Gal staining.

IPTG. A. Cells were treated with IPTG (I) in the presence of Torin 1, PP242 or Rapamycin (R) for 4 days and stained for beta-Gal. Bar –

far more potent in suppressing senescent morphology and
hypertrophy, compared with rapamycin.

treatment caused large flat and beta-gal positive
morphology in WI38t cells. In etoposide- and doxorubicintreated cells, co-treatment with either Torin 1 or PP242
prevented senescent morphology. Furthermore, when
WI38t cells were pre-treated with either senescing-drug
(etoposide or doxorubicin) alone, most of the cells lost
the ability to re-proliferate after drugs were removed. Cotreatment of cells with senescing-drugs and either Torin 1
or PP242 preserved RP after removal of the drugs. In other
words, treatment of cells with etoposide in the presence of
either Torin 1 or PP242 preserved some cells in reversible
quiescence instead of irreversible senescence. mTOR
inhibitors also prevented senescent morphology of SKBR3
cells undergoing senescence by treatment with PMA (Fig.
4C), a model of senescence described previously [82].

of Torin 1 and PP242 is not cell-type specific, we next
examined their effect on senescent morphology and RP
in WI38t fibroblasts undergoing senescence by treatment

As shown in Fig. 4A, both etoposide and doxorubicin

DISCUSSION

toxic, given the delicate mechanism of cellular division.
Still, mTOR inhibitors are cytostatic. Therefore, for
their clinical development as anti-aging drugs, it would
be important to determine balance between cytostatic
vs gerosuppressive effects. mTOR inhibitors also vary
in their affinity to mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes,
as well as by their off-target effects. Therefore, a
larger variety of inhibitors should be further tested at a
wider range of concentrations for their effects on cell
proliferation vs geroconversion. Optimal gerosuppressive
concentrations of various mTOR inhibitors should be
selected (Oncoscience, 2015, in press).

Rapamycin and other rapalogs are anti-inflammatory
and anti-aging drugs [83, 84]. Rapamycin slows down
aging, prevents age-related diseases and extends life span
in all species tested, including mice [85-104].
On cellular level, rapamycin and other rapalogs
inhibit geroconversion from cell cycle arrest to
senescence [51, 50]. In the organism, geroconversion
drives hyperfunctions, slowly causing age-related
pathologies [22, 105-107]. Suppression of geroconversion
(gerosuppression) by rapalogs is a surrogate of their antiaging effects. Therefore, to evaluate whether dual mTOR
inhibitors are potential anti-aging drugs, we investigated
gerosuppression in cell culture.
Loss of re-proliferative potential (RP) is a
quantitative marker of geroconversion. Non-senescent
(quiescent) cells retain RP, meaning that they can re-start
proliferation (re-proliferation), when arrest is reversed.
In contrast, senescent cells lack RP. We found that in the
presence of Torin 1 and PP242, arrested cells retained
RP. Like rapalogs, these pan-mTOR inhibitors prevented
loss of RP during cell cycle arrest caused by p21 and
etoposide. Importantly, mTOR inhibitors suppressed
geroconversion despite their intrinsic anti-proliferative
effect (in proliferating cells).
The ability of mTOR inhibitors to preserve RP
indicates that (at gerosuppressive concentrations)
mTOR inhibitors are not harmful in any way; otherwise
cells would not resume proliferation and would not
form colonies. In fact, at high concentrations, the
gerosuppressive effect, measured as preservation of RP,
decreased and even disappeared.
Gerosuppression coincided with inhibition of the
mTORC1/S6K/S6 axis. The maximal gerosuppression, as
measured by RP, was similar for rapalogs and pan-mTOR
inhibitors.
PP242 was 10 times less potent but it was also less
cytostatic and inhibited mTORC1/S6K/S6 at 10-fold
higher concentrations. We conclude that their effects are
almost identical at equipotent concentrations. At high
concentrations, Torin 1 and PP242 were more efficient
than rapamycin in suppressing cellular hypertrophy and
senescent morphology. This indicates that morphology
and hypertrophy depend in part on rapamycin-insensitive
functions of mTOR.
Rapamycin and other rapalogs have been safely
used even in daily high doses for many years in patients
[108-110], so their use as anti-aging drugs (intermittent
schedules) is expected to be without significant side
effects. Dual mTOR inhibitors have all activities of
rapamycin plus other effects and therefore must have
more side effects by definition. Still, our study indicates
that, at low concentrations, they may be considered as
potential anti-aging drugs because they can preserve reproliferation, which would be impossible if the drugs were

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
HT-p21 cells, derived from HT1080 human
fibrosarcoma cells, in which p21 expression can be turned
on and off using IPTG (isopropyl-thio-galactosidase)
were described [80, 81, 62]. HT-p21 cells were cultured in
DMEM/10% FC2 serum (HyClone FetaClone II; HyClone
Laboratories, Inc, Logan, UT), Immortalized WI38t human
fibroblasts, described previously [111], and SKBR3,
breast adenocarcinoma cell line (ATCC, Manassas, VA),
were maintained in DMEM/10% FBS. Rapamycin was
purchase from LC Laboratories (Woburn,MA). Torin 1
and PP242 were from Selleckchem (Houston, TX). Stock
solutions were prepared in DMSO.

Re-proliferative potential (RP)
Cells were plated at low densities and treated with
senescence-inducing agents as described in figure legends.
After 3-4-day treatment drugs were washed out and cells
were allowed to regrow in drug-free medium for a few
days as indicated in figure legends. Colonies were stained
with 1% Crystal Violet (Sigma-Aldrich) and counted.

Immunoblot analysis
Whole cell lysates were prepared using boiling
lysis buffer (1%SDS, 10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.4). Equal
amounts of proteins were separated on 10% or gradient
polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF
membranes [111]. Primary antibodies for the following
proteins were used: rabbit antibodies for phosphop70S6K(T389), phospho-pS6(S235/236), phospho4EBP1(T37/46), phospho-AKT(S473), AKT and mouse
antibody for S6 – from Cell Signaling Technology
