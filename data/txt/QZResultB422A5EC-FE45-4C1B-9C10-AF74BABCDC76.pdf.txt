Abstract
BCR-ABL plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) and some cases of acute lymphocytic
leukemia (ALL). Although ABL kinase inhibitors have shown
great promise in the treatment of CML, the persistence of
residual disease and the occurrence of resistance have
prompted investigations into the molecular effectors of BCRABL. Here, we show that BCR-ABL stimulates the proteasomedependent degradation of members of the forkhead family of
tumor suppressors in vitro, in an in vivo animal model, and
in samples from patients with BCR-ABL–positive CML or ALL.
As several downstream mediators of BCR-ABL are regulated
by the proteasome degradation pathway, we also show that
inhibition of this pathway, using bortezomib, causes regression of CML-like disease. Bortezomib treatment led to
inhibition of BCR-ABL–induced suppression of FoxO proteins
and their proapoptotic targets, tumor necrosis factor–related
apoptosis-inducing ligand and BIM, thereby providing novel
insights into the molecular effects of proteasome inhibitor
therapy. We additionally show sensitivity of imatinib-resistant
BCR-ABL T315I cells to bortezomib. Our data delineate the
involvement of FoxO proteins in BCR-ABL–induced evasion of
apoptosis and provide evidence that bortezomib is a candidate therapeutic in the treatment of BCR-ABL–induced
leukemia. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6546–55]

Introduction
The BCR-ABL oncoprotein plays a central role in the pathogenesis of virtually all chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and 15% to
30% of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cases (1–3). As a
constitutively active tyrosine kinase, BCR-ABL induces the hyperactivation of various signaling pathways that promote cell growth

and suppress apoptosis, ultimately resulting in leukemogenesis
(2, 4). In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in
the treatment of myeloproliferative diseases, especially with the
development of the ABL kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate
(Gleevec, STI-571; refs. 5, 6). Whereas clinical data from imatinib
treatment seem promising, the development of resistance due
to primary or acquired point mutations in BCR-ABL (7, 8) is a
growing problem. Although highly potent kinase inhibitors, such as
AMN107 (9) and BMS-354825 (10), have been recently developed to
target imatinib resistance, these compounds do not inhibit all
possible imatinib-resistant mutants of BCR-ABL [i.e., a commonly
occurring threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at residue 315 (T315I),
located within the kinase domain of BCR-ABL]. Alternative
strategies, such as Aurora kinase inhibitor, VX680, which also
targets ABL, as well as combination therapies using chemotherapeutic agents and imatinib have shown some success in the
treatment of the T315I mutant (11, 12). However, because these
strategies also target the ABL kinase, a genetic pressure may
promote the emergence of additional resistant mutants. Therefore,
the identification of novel strategies for the treatment of leukemia
is of high priority (13).
As an alternative to targeting the ABL kinase, a promising
approach involves the inhibition of downstream cellular pathways
critical for BCR-ABL–mediated leukemogenesis. The activation of
the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway plays a
significant role in BCR-ABL–mediated leukemogenesis (14). One
class of PI3-K/Akt effectors that are key regulators of cellular fate is
the FoxO subfamily of forkhead transcription factors, consisting of
FoxO3a, FoxO1, FoxO4, and FoxO6 (15–18). Recent evidence
suggests that FoxO proteins function as tumor suppressors (19)
and promote their growth-suppressive effects by up-regulating the
expression of cell cycle inhibitory genes and proapoptotic genes,
such as FasL (18) tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL; refs. 20, 21), and BIM (22–24). Therefore, the
transcriptional activity of FoxO3a is inhibited by Akt-dependent
phosphorylation, which causes retention of FoxO3a in the
cytoplasm (25). We and others have previously shown that BCRABL expression promotes FoxO3a phosphorylation at Akt consensus sites, leading to its persistent localization in the cytoplasm and
evasion of apoptosis (20, 23). The expression of a FoxO3a triple
mutant, in which all three Akt phosphorylation sites have been
mutated, results in constitutive activity of FoxO3a and promotes
the death of BCR-ABL–transformed cells (20, 23). Further, it has
been shown that silencing of FoxO3a in BCR-ABL–transformed
cells prevents apoptosis induced by imatinib, thereby providing

Proteasome Inhibition and Regression of Ph+ Leukemia

additional evidence toward the significance of FoxO3a inhibition in
BCR-ABL transformation (23).
Here, we test the hypothesis that BCR-ABL stimulates the
proteasome-dependent inhibition of members of the forkhead
family of tumor suppressors. Consequently, as FoxO proteins and
several other downstream mediators of BCR-ABL are regulated by
the proteasome degradation pathway, we investigate whether the
inhibition of the proteasome pathway, using bortezomib (Velcade,
PS-341), causes regression of leukemia. Overall, our results provide
novel evidence toward the involvement of the proteasome pathway
in the inhibition of FoxO tumor suppressors in the context of
leukemogenesis and show for the first time using an in vivo model
that the proteasome pathway plays a role in BCR-ABL–mediated
leukemogenesis. Our results also further indicate the potential for
proteasome inhibition therapy in the context of imatinib-resistant
BCR-ABL mutations.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids and cell lines. pMSCV-IRES-GFP and pMSCV-BCR-ABL-IRESGFP have been described in our previous work (26). BaF3 cells containing
either the control vector pMSCV neomycin resistance or pMSCV-BCR-ABL
(P210) neomycin resistance were provided by Dr. David Baltimore
(California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA). BaF3/BCR-ABL T315I
cells were provided by Drs. Azam Mohammad and George Daley (Children’s
Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA).
Reagents. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI-571, Novartis) and bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341, Millennium Pharmaceuticals) were purchased from
the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Pharmacy approved for research
purposes only. Antibodies include FKHRL-1 (FoxO3a), 4G10 phosphotyrosine, and HSP-90 (Upstate Biotechnology); h-actin (Sigma); phospho-FKHR
(FoxO1; Thr24)/FKHRL1 (FoxO3a; Thr32) and phospho-Akt (Ser473; Cell
Signaling Technology); c-Akt and c-ABL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and
BIM (Affinity Biolabs). Additional antibodies used for immunohistochemistry are TRAIL (ICL Labs, Inc.), BIM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and
myeloperoxidase (DAKO).
Bone marrow transduction, bone marrow transplantation, and
bortezomib treatment. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was carried
out according to standard protocols (27, 28). Ten days after BMT, treatments
via tail vein injection with either vehicle control (0.9% saline) or bortezomib
were done twice weekly. Blood was obtained from the tail vein and blood
smear slides were prepared with Wright-Giemsa stain solution HEMA-QUIK
II (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
S.c. xenograft tumor model and treatment. BaF3-BCR-ABL or BaF3BCR-ABL (T315I) cells were mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at 1:1
(v/v), and 100 AL of the mixture containing 5  106 BaF3/p210 or 5  106
BaF3/p210 (T315I) cells were injected s.c. into the right flank of nu/nu mice
(8 wk old, female; Charles River Laboratories, Inc.). When tumor volumes
reached 150 to 200 mm3, mice were randomized to obtain 12 mice into each
treatment group. Imatinib was dissolved in distilled water and delivered at
100 mg/kg in 100 AL by gavage twice a day. Bortezomib was dissolved in
0.9% saline and delivered at 0.8 mg/kg in 100 AL by tail vein (i.v.) injection
twice weekly. Tumor volume was measured using calipers in two
dimensions and calculated using the formula (width2  length)/2.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed as
described previously (29).
Patient sample isolation and analysis. Discarded whole blood samples
(8 cm3) from CML and ALL patients or from healthy individuals were
collected in heparin vacutainer tubes. Mononuclear cells were separated
using 4 mL of Ficoll-Paque gradient using standard procedures.

Results
FoxO tumor suppressors are down-regulated in BCR-ABL–
transformed cells. Studies in mice with different levels of FoxO
deficiency showed that germ-line and somatic FoxO null mutations

www.aacrjournals.org

of up to five alleles result in mild neoplastic phenotypes (19, 30).
Thus, an oncogenic challenge may be necessary to reveal the
transformation-promoting effects of an incomplete loss of FoxO.
The inhibition of FoxO activity constitutes an important mechanism by which BCR-ABL suppresses apoptosis and induces
transformation (20, 23). Therefore, it is essential to determine the
molecular mechanisms by which BCR-ABL negatively regulates
FoxO proteins. In these studies, we will primarily show our data
with FoxO3a; however, in some key studies, we also provide data for
other members of this family.
Phosphorylation of FoxO proteins at their Akt consensus sites
inhibits their activity. BCR-ABL–transformed BaF3 cells maintain
FoxO3a phosphorylation at an Akt-mediated phosphorylation site
(Thr32) despite the absence of interleukin (IL)-3 (Fig. 1A). In
contrast, nontransformed BaF3 cells (dependent on IL-3 for
survival) lose this phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Additionally, an
approximate 60% decrease in total FoxO3a protein expression
levels is detected in BCR-ABL–transformed compared with nontransformed BaF3 cells (Fig. 1A). Therefore, the inhibition of
FoxO3a in BCR-ABL–transformed cells extends beyond phosphorylation and also results in the suppression of FoxO3a protein
expression. Consistent with this observation, treatment of BaF3/
BCR-ABL cells with imatinib resulted in increased expression of
FoxO3a (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B), indicating that suppression of FoxO3a expression is, at least in part, dependent on BCRABL kinase activity.
To determine whether BCR-ABL–induced inhibition of FoxO3a
expression is a primary event in response to BCR-ABL expression,
we transduced primary murine BM cells with retroviruses
containing either control IRES-GFP or BCR-ABL-IRES-GFP. Cells
were subsequently sorted for GFP expression via flow cytometry,

and their GFP positivity was ascertained with fluorescence
microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S2). Notably, FoxO3a expression
was suppressed by f87% in BCR-ABL-BM cells compared with
vector control BM cells (Fig. 1B). Importantly, both types of cells
were grown in the presence of growth factors, yet FoxO3a
expression remained higher in control BM cells than in BCRABL-BM cells. These data indicate that normal growth factor
receptor signaling does not reduce the levels of FoxO3a expression
to that observed in BCR-ABL–expressing cells and thereby support
a role for BCR-ABL–induced suppression of FoxO3a expression. In
addition to FoxO3a, we also observed attenuation of FoxO1 and
FoxO4 expression in BCR-ABL–transformed cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3).
The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib restores FoxO3a
expression in BCR-ABL–transformed cells. Phosphorylation of
substrates by activated Akt leads to their degradation via the
proteasome (31). The constitutive activation of the PI3-K/Akt
pathway has been well established in BCR-ABL transformation
(14, 32, 33). We observed that FoxO3a suppression in BCR-ABL–

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

transformed cells is dependent on the activation of the PI3-K
pathway, as chemical inhibition of this pathway with LY 294002 not
only reduced FoxO3a phosphorylation but also restored FoxO3a
protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Such observations
suggested that FoxO3a down-regulation in BCR-ABL–transformed
cells could be proteasome dependent. To test this hypothesis, we
investigated whether the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib can
reverse BCR-ABL–induced suppression of FoxO3a.
Bortezomib is the first highly potent inhibitor of the proteasome
to enter the clinic and is Food and Drug Administration approved
for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma
(34–36) as well as relapsed and refractory mantle cell lymphoma
(37). Treatment of BaF3/BCR-ABL cells with bortezomib showed a
dose-dependent increase in apoptosis, as measured by Annexin
V-phycoerythrin (PE)/7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining
(Fig. 2A). Bortezomib treatment showed a dose-dependent increase
in FoxO3a protein expression as early as 3 hours (Fig. 2B).
In addition, even at the lowest concentration (10 nmol/L) used in
these studies, bortezomib resulted in an f5-fold increase in

FoxO3a expression over a 24-hour time course (Fig. 2C). We
confirmed proteasome inhibition–induced increases in FoxO3a
protein expression by treatment with another proteasome inhibitor,
epoxomicin (Supplementary Fig. S4). Taken together, these results
show that inhibition of the proteasome induces apoptosis and
up-regulates FoxO3a levels in BCR-ABL–transformed cells.
Because Akt-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO3a targets it for
proteasomal degradation (31), we expected that proteasome
inhibition in BaF3/BCR-ABL cells would result in accumulation
of phosphorylated FoxO3a. Phosphorylated FoxO3a levels initially
increased after bortezomib treatment, but by 24 hours, the increase
in total FoxO3a expression exceeded the increase in phosphorylated FoxO3a (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that bortezomib
treatment promotes the accumulation of nonphosphorylated
FoxO3a, which is localized in the nucleus, where it can serve its
transcriptional inducing activity. We therefore analyzed FoxO3a
expression in nuclear extracts from cells treated with bortezomib.
In contrast to untreated controls, FoxO3a significantly accumulated in the nucleus of bortezomib-treated BaF3/BCR-ABL cells
(Fig. 2D).
To assess the effect of bortezomib on proapoptotic factors
downstream of FoxO3a, we analyzed the expression of BIM, which
is regulated by FoxO3a (22) and is suppressed in a FoxO3adependent manner in BCR-ABL–transformed cells (23). We
observed that BIM expression increased in response to bortezomib
(Fig. 2C ). Because BIM is also regulated by proteasomal
degradation, the observed increase in BIM protein expression
could be due to both FoxO3a-dependent and FoxO3a-independent
effects. TRAIL is another target of FoxO3a that is suppressed in

BCR-ABL–transformed cells (20). We found that bortezomib
treatment of BaF3/BCR-ABL cells led to a modest but statistically
significant increase in TRAIL mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Therefore, the apoptosis-inducing effects of bortezomib treatment
in BCR-ABL–transformed cells are, at least in part, caused by an
increase in the expression of the proapoptotic factors BIM and
TRAIL, a likely consequence of the restoration of nuclear FoxO3a.
BCR-ABL–expressing primary BM cells are highly sensitive
to bortezomib. As several downstream mediators of BCR-ABL,
including FoxO proteins, are regulated by proteasomal degradation,
we then hypothesized that inhibition of the proteasomal degradation pathway could suppress BCR-ABL–induced leukemia. Tumor
cells have been shown to display greater sensitivity to the effects of
bortezomib than normal cells (38, 39). One explanation for this
differential sensitivity is that cancer cells rely on the proteasome
to a greater extent than normal cells to perturb the expression of
proteins involved in regulating the cell cycle and apoptosis (40).
We investigated whether bortezomib selectively affects BCR-ABL–
expressing cells over normal primary BM cells. Importantly, BCRABL–expressing BM cells (Fig. 3A) treated with 10 nmol/L
bortezomib showed a significant reduction in survival compared
with vector control cells. This was observed by the significant
reduction in GFP-positive cells, which correlates with the
appearance of dead BCR-ABL–expressing BM cells (Fig. 3B). To
quantify these differences, we measured cell viability in response to
bortezomib treatment over a 0 to 10 nmol/L range in both normal
and BCR-ABL–expressing primary BM cells and observed that
BCR-ABL–expressing cells are approximately thrice more sensitive
to bortezomib than normal cells (Fig. 3C).

Figure 4. Treatment of BCR-ABL–transduced mice with bortezomib decreases signs of CML-like illness and prolongs survival. A, Wright-Giemsa staining of blood
smears from vehicle-treated vector control, vehicle-treated BCR-ABL, and bortezomib-treated BCR-ABL–transduced mice (on day 21 after BMT, and after four
treatments of 0.8 mg/kg bortezomib) shows an excess of granulocytes (dark purple ) in BCR-ABL mice but decreased staining of granulocytes in bortezomib-treated
BCR-ABL–transduced mice comparable with vector control mice. Original magnification, 200. B, bortezomib treatment reduces splenomegaly in
BCR-ABL–transduced mice. Spleens were isolated on day 21 after BMT and 4 bortezomib treatments (left) and on day 42 after BMT and 11 treatments (right ).
Groups treated with vehicle only are marked as , and groups treated with bortezomib are marked as +. Spleen weight was indicated at the bottom of each group.
The statistical significance of differences among various groups of spleen weight was determined by ANOVA. n = 3 for all groups. Significant values are as follows:
P < 0.001 for day 21 BCR-ABL group treated with vehicle only versus all other groups (including day 42 groups), P < 0.05 for day 21 BCR-ABL group treated
with bortezomib versus control groups, and P < 0.05 for day 42 BCR-ABL group treated with bortezomib versus day 21 BCR-ABL group treated with bortezomib.
C, H&E staining of spleen samples obtained from the same groups of mice described in B shows reduced myeloid infiltration in the spleens of BCR-ABL–transduced
mice treated with bortezomib. D, bortezomib treatment prolongs survival of BCR-ABL–transduced mice. BCR-ABL–transduced mice were treated with either
vehicle (0.9% saline) or bortezomib (0.8 mg/kg). Survival of mice was plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method (nonparametric cumulated survival fraction plot), and
statistical comparison between the curves was obtained using the log-rank test. P < 0.01 for BCR-ABL group treated with bortezomib (n = 15) versus BCR-ABL
group treated with vehicle only (n = 14).

Bortezomib inhibits CML-like disease and prolongs survival
in a BCR-ABL murine BM transplant model. Human CML can
be faithfully modeled in mice by retroviral transduction of the BCRABL oncogene into mouse BM cells followed by transplantation
into irradiated syngeneic recipient mice (27, 28). Mice that receive
BCR-ABL–transduced BM develop a fatal CML-like myeloproliferative disease in 3 to 4 weeks. This system has been useful both
in determining molecular mechanisms by which the BCR-ABL
oncogene acts in the pathogenesis of CML and for the testing of
potential therapies (2, 9, 28, 41).
We used this model to test whether inhibition of the proteasome
degradation pathway by bortezomib can reverse BCR-ABL–induced

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

CML progression. Previous studies have reported the effectiveness
of bortezomib at doses ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg (42–45). To
determine the optimal dose for our studies, we generated vector
control and BCR-ABL–transduced mice and treated the mice twice
weekly with 0 mg/kg (vehicle), 0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, or 1.0 mg/kg
of bortezomib. After three treatments, we observed maximal suppression of splenomegaly, or the enlarged spleen that is typically
observed in this CML model, from mice treated with bortezomib at
1.0 mg/kg (n = 3; Supplementary Fig. S6). As previous studies have
found 0.8 mg/kg to be optimal (43, 45), we also tested this dose and
found a similar response as with 1.0 mg/kg (Fig. 4B). Therefore, we
chose 0.8 mg/kg for the following studies.

Proteasome Inhibition and Regression of Ph+ Leukemia

Either vehicle control (0.9% saline) or bortezomib (0.8 mg/kg)
was administered by i.v. injection into BCR-ABL–transduced mice
10 days after BM transplantation (BMT) and continued on a twice
weekly treatment schedule. Blood samples were collected on day 21
after BMT and also after each of four bortezomib treatments to
determine the level of leukocytes. In contrast to vector control
mice, BCR-ABL–transduced mice had an excess of leukocytes
detected by Wright-Giemsa staining of peripheral blood smears
(Fig. 4A). However, bortezomib-treated BCR-ABL–transduced mice
had fewer leukocytes, resembling vector control mice (Fig. 4A).
Similarly, the complete blood count showed a statistically
significant (P = 0.019, two-tailed Student’s t test) increase in
WBC count among the BCR-ABL–transduced (untreated) mice
(range, 11.48–34.56  103cells/AL; n = 3) compared with vehicle
only control or BCR-ABL mice treated with bortezomib (n = 13;
range, 2.14–9.18  103 cells/AL; one outlier at 26.18  103 cells/AL
was also included in the analysis). The normal reference range at
the laboratory tested is 5.4 to 16  103 cells/AL.

Yet another significant symptom of CML-like disease in this
model is splenomegaly, and by 21 days after BMT, we clearly
observed splenomegaly in vehicle-treated BCR-ABL–transduced
mice but not in vector control mice. Bortezomib treatment
significantly reduced splenomegaly in BCR-ABL–transduced mice
(P < 0.001) by day 21 and resulted in further reduction by day 42
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4B). On examination of the spleen tissue by H&E
staining, we found that spleen samples from BCR-ABL mice treated
with vehicle control displayed heavy infiltration of myeloid cells
(Fig. 4C). In contrast, bortezomib-treated BCR-ABL spleen samples
showed little myeloid infiltration (Fig. 4C). We also observed
similar pathologic changes in the liver (data not shown).
We next determined whether the attenuation of CML-like
pathophysiology in the BCR-ABL–induced CML mouse model
correlated with increased survival. BCR-ABL–transduced mice
treated with vehicle control began to die as early as 16 days after
BMT, but the majority of mice in this group died during the 3rd and
the 4th weeks after BMT (n = 14; Fig. 4D, broad solid line). In the

Figure 6. Imatinib-resistant T315I BCR-ABL–transformed cells are sensitive to bortezomib. A, representative flow cytometry dot plots [Annexin V-PE (X axis )
and 7-AAD (Y axis ) staining] comparing BaF3/BCR-ABL and BaF3/BCR-ABL T315I cells, treated for 24 h with 50 nmol/L bortezomib, and showing significant induction
of apoptosis (cells represented in the left right, top right , and top left quadrants). Imatinib resistance is confirmed in T315I cells. B, Western blot indicating an
increase in FoxO3a expression on bortezomib treatment of BaF3/BCR-ABL T315I cells. C, bortezomib inhibits both BaF3-BCR-ABL and BaF3-BCR-ABL (T315I)
xenograft tumor growth, whereas BaF3/p210 (T315I) tumors do not respond to imatinib inhibition.

bortezomib-treated BCR-ABL group, 47% of the mice had survived
at the end of 1 month after BMT, and the last mouse in this
group died by day 49 after BMT (n = 15; Fig. 4D, fine solid line).
These data show that the survival of bortezomib-treated, BCR-ABL–
transduced mice was significantly prolonged (P < 0.01). Finally, we
determined that bortezomib treatment did result in a molecular
regression of leukemia, as quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
analysis of BM cells on day 21 revealed that the normalized copy
number of BCR-ABL in bortezomib-treated mice was significantly
reduced compared with that of an untreated mouse (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Bortezomib treatment of BCR-ABL–transduced leukemic
mice restores normal expression of FoxO3a and its targets
TRAIL and BIM. We analyzed the effect of bortezomib treatment
on FoxO, TRAIL, and BIM expression. We could barely detect FoxO3a
protein in the BCR-ABL–transduced mice, whereas moderate
expression was found in control mice, providing further support for
inhibition of FoxO3a tumor suppressor by the BCR-ABL oncogene
(Fig. 5A). The positive staining of myeloperoxidase in vehicle-treated
BCR-ABL mice confirmed that overall protein expression was not
affected in these mice (Fig. 5A). Bortezomib treatment completely

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

restored FoxO3a protein expression to a level comparable in vehicletreated control mice (Fig. 5A and B). We observed similar results
in the marrow where FoxO3a protein expression was virtually absent
in vehicle-treated BCR-ABL–transduced mice but was restored in
response to treatment with bortezomib (Fig. 5B). Taken together,
these results provide novel in vivo evidence that greatly diminished
protein expression of FoxO3a tumor suppressor is associated with
BCR-ABL–mediated leukemogenesis.
Given that the phosphorylation of FoxO3a is an important
mechanism for its negative regulation (25, 31), we compared
FoxO3a phosphorylation in control and BCR-ABL–transduced mice
using an antibody that detects the phosphorylated forms of FoxO3a
(Thr32) as well as that of the FoxO family member FoxO1 (Thr24).
This analysis indicated that BCR-ABL mice express phosphorylated
FoxO3a and FoxO1, albeit at low levels, whereas similar or slightly
higher levels were observed in control mice (Fig. 5C). Consistent
with our in vitro findings (Fig. 1A), these results suggest that the
lower level of FoxO3a that is present in BCR-ABL mice is
predominantly phosphorylated and is therefore inactive.
We also observed that the expression of the FoxO3a targets,
observed TRAIL, and BIM was greatly diminished in leukemic

BCR-ABL mice, in contrast to vector control mice (Supplementary
Fig. S8B and C). Importantly, bortezomib-treated BCR-ABL–
transduced mice indicated a clear restoration of expression of
these proteins to the levels found in control mice (Supplementary
Fig. S8B and C).
Bortezomib restores expression of FoxO3a in imatinibresistant T315I cells. The T315I BCR-ABL mutation frequently
occurs in CML patients that are resistant to imatinib (11) and even
remains refractory to the more potent second-generation kinase
inhibitors (9–11). Bortezomib treatment of imatinib-resistant BCRABL T315I cells significantly reduced cell survival and induced
apoptosis, as measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Supplementary Fig. S9A) and
Annexin V-PE/7-AAD staining, respectively (Fig. 6A). By 48 hours of
bortezomib treatment, both BaF3/BCR-ABL and BaF3/BCR-ABL
T315I cells showed similar percentages of predominantly late
apoptotic cells (Supplementary Fig. S9B).
Similar to imatinib-sensitive BCR-ABL cells (Fig. 2C), FoxO3a
protein expression was also restored in T315I cells on treatment
with bortezomib (Fig. 6B). As an indicator of downstream
apoptotic events in response to bortezomib treatment, the protein
expression of BIM (particularly the extra long splice variant) was
increased on bortezomib treatment (Fig. 6B). These results indicate
that FoxO3a is repressed in imatinib-resistant T315I cells and that
proteasome inhibition restores FoxO3a and induces apoptosis.
FoxO3a depletion via small interfering RNAs resulted in a partial
rescue against bortezomib sensitivity in BCR-ABL T315I cells,
suggesting that FoxO3a activity in part contributes to the effects of
bortezomib (Supplementary Fig. S9C and D). We then examined
the effect of bortezomib on BCR-ABL (T315I)–expressing tumors
in vivo. BaF3-BCR-ABL or BaF3-BCR-ABL (T315I) cells were used
to generate xenograft tumor in nude mice by s.c. injection.
Either imatinib or bortezomib treatment resulted in inhibition of
wild-type BCR-ABL–expressing tumors as early as 1 week (Fig. 6C).
Twenty days of imatinib or bortezomib treatment caused
significant inhibition of tumor growth compared with vehicle
group (P < 0.001 for imatinib versus vehicle and P < 0.001 for
bortezomib versus vehicle, by one-way ANOVA). In the BaF3-BCRABL (T315I) tumors, bortezomib treatment started to show tumor
inhibition as early as 1 week after treatment (Fig. 6C), whereas
imatinib did not show any effect. By 20 days after treatment,
bortezomib caused significant inhibition on tumor growth
compared with vehicle group and imatinib group (P < 0.001 for
bortezomib versus vehicle and P < 0.01 for bortezomib versus
imatinib, by one-way ANOVA). These results show that although
BaF3-BCR-ABL (T315I) xenograft tumors are resistant to imatinib,
their growth can be significantly inhibited by bortezomib.
FoxO3a expression is suppressed in Philadelphia chromosome–positive CML and ALL patients. To investigate whether
FoxO3a protein expression is also lost in Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph+) leukemia patients, we analyzed the peripheral
blood samples of several CML and ALL patients. Peripheral
blood was obtained from newly diagnosed CML patients (P1, P2,
and P3) who had not yet initiated any therapy. We also obtained
peripheral blood from an ALL patient (P4) who was failing the
standard therapy for ALL. Fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) confirmed that these patients carried the BCR-ABL
translocation (Supplementary Fig. S10A and B). Western blot
analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell preparations showed
a significantly reduced expression of FoxO3a in leukemic samples,
in contrast to healthy individuals (N; Fig. 5D). H&E staining of the

www.aacrjournals.org

diagnostic BM biopsy from the ALL patient shows a massive blast,
with few normal hematopoietic cells (Supplementary Fig. S10C).
Immunohistochemical analysis of the BM biopsy shows that
FoxO3a is mainly expressed in normal hematopoietic cells and
not in the blast cells. These observations provide evidence that
FoxO3a is suppressed in these hematologic malignancies, whereby
loss of its expression is correlated with the leukemic disease.

Discussion
An understanding of the molecular basis for the survival of
tumor cells through resistance to apoptosis is critical for the
development of rational and suitably targeted antineoplastic
therapies. An increasing number of studies have shown that
activation of the PI3-K/Akt survival pathway plays an important
role in BCR-ABL–mediated leukemogenesis. More recently, the
significance of Akt activation in CML was investigated in the
context of imatinib resistance. Interestingly, whereas the BCR-ABL
T315I imatinib-resistant mutation is refractory to the combination
of imatinib and numerous compounds, inhibition of Akt signaling
with a phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 inhibitor, OSU-03012,
synergizes with imatinib to induce apoptosis in BCR-ABL T315I
cells (46). These studies suggest that Akt activation is an important
event even in imatinib-resistant CML.
The FoxO3a transcription factor represents a critical substrate
that is inhibited by Akt during growth factor–induced survival (25).
We and other groups have previously shown that BCR-ABL imposes
negative regulation of FoxO3a by promoting its constitutive
phosphorylation and retention in the cytoplasm. Indeed, expression
of a FoxO3a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated results in
apoptosis of BCR-ABL–transformed cells (20, 23). Therefore, FoxO3a
acts as a tumor suppressor, and its negative regulation is an important aspect of BCR-ABL–induced leukemia. In this study, we
report that FoxO3a protein levels are greatly suppressed in BCRABL–transformed cells and BCR-ABL–expressing primary BM cells
as well as in a BCR-ABL murine BM transplant model for CML.
Importantly, we also observed this dramatic reduction in FoxO3a
in newly diagnosed (before any treatment) CML patients and a
BCR-ABL–positive ALL patient. We show that treatment with
bortezomib restores normal FoxO3a expression, and this restoration of FoxO3a was associated with a significant reduction of CMLlike illness and prolonged survival of BCR-ABL–transduced mice.
Constitutive FoxO3a inhibition via phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention in BCR-ABL–transformed cells leads to the suppressed
expression of proapoptotic genes, such as BIM and TRAIL, and is
therefore an important mechanism for BCR-ABL transformation
(20, 23). Our in vitro findings revealed that bortezomib treatment led
to the nuclear accumulation of FoxO3a, which correlated with an
increase in the expression level of the FoxO3a gene targets TRAIL
and BIM and the induction of apoptosis in BCR-ABL–transformed
cells. As TRAIL is a key mediator of tumor surveillance, the BCRABL–induced suppression of FoxO3a and TRAIL could interfere with
tumor surveillance and thereby promote tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, our findings that BIM expression is normalized in
response to bortezomib treatment of BCR-ABL–transduced mice is
consistent with a recent report that showed BIM as an important
mediator of apoptosis induced by the combination of paclitaxel and
bortezomib in epithelial tumor cells (47). In general, our demonstration that FoxO3a, TRAIL, and BIM suppression in BCR-ABL–
induced leukemogenesis is abrogated by proteasome inhibition in
cell culture studies and in an in vivo mice model reveals novel

mechanistic insights into the molecular effects and mechanisms
of action of the antineoplastic proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
not only in leukemia but also potentially in other malignancies.
Our studies also reveal that FoxO3a is also suppressed in BCRABL T315I cells and show that proteasome inhibition with
bortezomib reverses FoxO3a suppression as well as potently
induces apoptosis in these cells. Given that FoxO3a is emerging
as a potential tumor suppressor, with its inactivation recently
observed in several transformed cell lines and cancers (19, 48–50),
it remains possible that FoxO3a activation is one of the important
mechanisms for the antineoplastic activity of bortezomib in other
cancers as well. In the future, it will be important to determine the
role of additional signaling pathways that contribute toward the
effects of bortezomib against BCR-ABL–transformed cells.
Therefore, these results, in principle, show the ability of a clinically
approved proteasome inhibitor to reduce the burden of BCR-ABL–
induced leukemic disease and carry important therapeutic implications regarding the management of resistance to imatinib therapy.
