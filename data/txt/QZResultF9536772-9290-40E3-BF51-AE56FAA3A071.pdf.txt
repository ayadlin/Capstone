Abstract
The tumor suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin
homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) plays an
important role in intestinal cell proliferation and differentiation and tumor suppression by antagonizing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Despite its importance, the molecular
mechanisms regulating PTEN expression are largely undefined. Here, we show that treatment of the colon cancer cell
line HT29 with the differentiating agent sodium butyrate
(NaBT) increased PTEN protein and mRNA expression and
induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Inhibition of JNK by chemical or genetic methods attenuated NaBTinduced PTEN expression. In addition, our findings showed a
cross-talk between nuclear factor KB (NF-KB) and JNK with
respect to PTEN regulation. Overexpression of the NF-KB
superrepressor increased PTEN expression and JNK activity,
whereas overexpression of the p65 NF-KB subunit reduced
both basal and NaBT-mediated JNK activation and PTEN
expression. Moreover, we showed that overexpression of PTEN
or treatment with NaBT increased expression of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 in HT29 cells; this
induction was attenuated by inhibition of PTEN or JNK
expression or overexpression of p65. Finally, we show a role
for PTEN in NaBT-mediated cell death and differentiation. Our
findings suggest that the JNK/PTEN and NF-KB/PTEN pathways play a critical role in normal intestinal homeostasis and
colon carcinogenesis. [Cancer Res 2007;67(16):7773–81]

Introduction
The tumor suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) antagonizes the activity
of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by dephosphorylating the
D3-phosphate group of lipid second messengers, thus serving as a
negative regulator of the PI3K pathway (1). PTEN inhibits
downstream functions mediated by the PI3K pathway, such as cell
growth and survival, cell migration, and invasion (2), and cell cycle
progression through the regulation of the expression of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor protein p27kip1(3), which is induced by
PTEN in various cells (4, 5). Previously, we showed that inhibition
of PI3K or overexpression of PTEN significantly enhances intestinal
cell differentiation either spontaneously or induced by the shortchain fatty acid sodium butyrate (NaBT; ref. 6), a histone
deacetylase inhibitor produced in the colon by breakdown of

dietary fiber (7). PTEN expression correlates with expression of
Cdx-2, a homeodomain protein required for intestinal epithelial cell
differentiation, along the length of the murine colon (8). Moreover,
PTEN stimulates Cdx-2 protein expression and the transcriptional
activity of the Cdx-2 promoter, thus further indicating a role for
PTEN in the process of intestinal differentiation. Despite the
importance of PTEN in apoptosis and differentiation, little is
known about the regulation of PTEN expression.
Nuclear factor nB (NF-nB) is a heterodimer consisting of the
DNA binding subunit p50 and the transactivation subunit RelA/
p65. The activation pathway of NF-nB is regulated by an
endogenous cytoplasmic inhibitor, InB, which, in response to
certain stimuli, is phosphorylated and degraded, leaving NF-nB to
translocate into the nucleus (9). NF-nB is a central regulator of
the transcriptional activation of a number of genes involved in
apoptosis, differentiation, and growth; induction of these genes in
intestinal epithelial cells by activated NF-nB profoundly influences
mucosal inflammation, repair, and inflammation-associated gastrointestinal cancers (10, 11). Recently, we have showen a novel
feedback regulation of PTEN through tumor necrosis factor a
(TNFa)–mediated NF-nB activation (12). In agreement with our
findings, Vasudevan et al. (13) reported a suppressive effect of
NF-nB activation on PTEN expression and the prevention of
apoptosis. Given the roles of PTEN in antagonizing PI3K-mediated
cell survival and tumorigenesis, these findings suggest that PTEN
plays an important role in NF-nB function.
c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK) is a subfamily of the
mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily (14). JNK has three
isoforms (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3). Among them, JNK1 and JNK2 are
ubiquitously expressed whereas JNK3 is mainly expressed in
neuronal tissues and in the heart (15). JNK was originally identified
by its ability to specifically phosphorylate the transcription factor
c-Jun on its NH2-terminal transactivation domain. The JNK
pathway and NF-nB play important roles in numerous physiologic
processes (16). For example, the balance between NF-nB and JNK
activity controls dendritic cell survival (17). JNK inhibition results
in NF-nB activation in multiple myeloma cell lines (18), and NF-nB
activation induces MUC2 transcription whereas JNK activation
inhibits this induction in human colon epithelial cells (19).
Previously, we found that induction of intestinal cell differentiation
is associated with increased JNK activity and c-Jun phosphorylation
(20). In agreement with these findings, inhibition of JNK has been
shown to attenuate intestinal cell differentiation (21).
The purpose of our present study was to determine the role of
JNK in the regulation of PTEN expression. Here, we show that NaBT
induces NF-nB inhibition and JNK activation, leading to PTEN
expression in intestinal cells. Interestingly, our findings show a
cross-talk mechanism between the NF-nB and JNK pathways on
PTEN regulation. Moreover, NaBT induces p27kip1 expression
through the JNK/PTEN and NF-nB/PTEN pathways. Our results

identify PTEN as a downstream target of the JNK pathway. In
addition, our findings suggest that the JNK/PTEN signaling
pathway may regulate intestinal cell differentiation through the
regulation of p27kip1 expression.

pooled SMARTselection-designed siRNAs: JNK2 siRNA1 (5¶-GGAAAGAGCUAAUUUACAA-3¶), JNK2 siRNA2 (5¶-AAAGAGAGCUUAUCGUGAA-3¶),
JNK2 siRNA3 (5¶-CAAGAUGUGUAUUUGGUUA-3¶), and JNK2 siRNA4
(5¶-GAUGAUAGGUUAGAAAUAG-3¶). All siRNAs were synthesized with UU
as a 3¶-overhang on each strand. Adenovirus vectors encoding h-gal (AdCALacZ; control) and PTEN (AdCA-PTEN) were from Dr. Akira Horii (Tohoku
University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan). Adenovirus vector encoding
hemagglutinin-tagged InB-a superrepressor (Ad5InB-AA) and its control
vector (Ad5GFP) were gifts from Dr. Christian Jobin (University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The adenovirus vector encoding NF-nB p65
subunit (Ad5p65) and its control vector (Ad5GFP) were from Dr. Craig
Logsdon (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). [g-32P]ATP
(3,000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Total RNA was
isolated using Ultraspec RNA (Biotecx Laboratories). Polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes for Western blots were from Millipore Corp.,
and X-ray film was purchased from Eastman Kodak. The enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) system for Western immunoblot analysis was

(RT-PCR) reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other
reagents were of molecular biology grade and purchased from Sigma.

Cell culture and treatments. The human colon cancer cell lines HT29
and Caco-2 and human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MA). Rat intestinal
epithelial (RIE-1) cells were obtained from Dr. Kenneth D. Brown
(Cambridge Research Station, Babraham, Cambridge, United Kingdom).
HT29 cells were maintained in McCoy’s 5A supplemented with 10% FCS.
Caco-2 cells were incubated in MEM supplemented with 15% fetal bovine
serum. HEK293 and RIE-1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% FCS. Cells were infected with adenovirus vectors at 10 plaque-forming
units/cell as previously described (22) and incubated for 24 h before
initiating treatment. JNK inhibitor, SP600125, was initially dissolved in
DMSO, and effects were compared with cells treated with DMSO at the
same final concentration.
Transient transfection and luciferase assays. The JNK1, JNK2, and
nontargeting control siRNA SMARTpool duplexes were introduced into cells by
electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) as we have previously described (23).
siRNA SMARTpool, consisting of four siRNA duplexes, was designed using an
algorithm composed of 33 criteria and variables that effectively eliminate
nonfunctional siRNA (24). For luciferase assay, HT29 cells were seeded at
1  105 into 24-well plates in triplicate 24 h before transfection. Cells were then
transiently transfected with 0.5 Ag of NF-nB reporter plasmid and 0.05 Ag of
Renilla reporter pRL-null to normalize for variation in transfection efficiency,
using LipofectAMINE Plus transfection agent following the manufacturer’s
recommended protocol. Cells were harvested for measurement of firefly and
Renilla luciferase activities using the dual luciferase assay system. Firefly
luciferase activity was determined by subtracting background signal and
normalized to the Renilla activity.
JNK activity assay. Cell lysates were incubated with 1.5 Ag of anti-JNK1 or
anti-JNK2 antibody overnight at 4jC. Immune complexes were recovered
with protein A-Sepharose beads, then washed twice with lysis buffer and
once with kinase buffer. Pellets were resuspended in 40 AL of kinase buffer
[25 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 mmol/L
MgCl2, and 5 ACi of [g-32P]ATP] containing c-Jun protein at 30jC for 30 min
as previously described (20). The kinase reaction was terminated by addition
of SDS sample loading buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 6.8), 100 mmol/L DTT,
2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol]. The samples were then
heated to 95jC for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and
the phosphorylated protein was visualized by autoradiography.
RNA isolation, RT-PCR, and Northern blot analysis. RNA was isolated
from cells using Ultraspec RNA reagent according to the manufacturer’s
protocol and as we have previously described (25). Total RNA (5 Ag) was reverse
transcribed with Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and PCR

A, HT29 cells were pretreated with a
specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125, for
30 min followed by treatment with NaBT
for 4, 8, or 24 h. Total protein was extracted
and Western blot was done for analysis of
PTEN protein expression. B, HT29 cells

Whole-cell protein was extracted for
immunoprecipitation with anti-JNK1 or
anti-JNK2 antibody. JNK1 and JNK2
activity was assessed by an in vitro
kinase assay using GST-c-Jun protein as
substrate. D, HT29 cells were transfected
with siRNA directed to JNK1 or JNK2 or
control siRNA. Cells were harvested
12 or 24 h after transfection (left ), or
24 h after transfection, cells were treated
with NaBT for an additional 24 h
(middle and right ). Whole-cell protein was

was done using the following two primers: 5¶-ACAGGCTCCCAGACATGACA-3¶,
which spans nucleotides 1,018 to 1,037 of human PTEN mRNA sequence, and
5¶-TCAGACTTTTGTAATTTGTGTATG-3¶, which is complementary to nucleotides 2,217 to 2,240 of the mRNA sequence (25). The PCR product was
sequenced for confirmation and used as a probe for Northern blot. RNA (30 Ag)
was run in 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to supported
nitrocellulose. Membranes were hybridized to a random-primed 32P-labeled
PTEN cDNA probe. After hybridization with the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe, a control for equality of RNA loading,
membranes were washed again and signals detected by autoradiography.
Protein preparation, Western immunoblot, and enzymatic assay.
Western immunoblot analyses were done as previously described (26).
Briefly, cells were lysed with TNN buffer at 4jC for 30 min. Lysates were
clarified by centrifugation (10,000  g for 30 min at 4jC) and protein
concentrations determined using the method of Bradford (27). Total protein
(100 Ag) was resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF
membranes. Filters were incubated overnight at 4jC in blotting solution
(Tris-buffer saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20).
Expressions of PTEN, JNK1, JNK2, hemagglutinin-tagged InB-AA, p50, InBa,
ERK1, p65, and p27kip1 were detected with specific antibodies after blotting
with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody and
visualized by ECL detection. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity was
detected with an intestinal alkaline phosphatase kit from Sigma as we have
previously described (6).
Preparation of nuclear extracts and electrophoretic mobility shift
assays. The nuclear extracts were prepared from HT29 cells according to
the procedure previously described (28) with minor modifications. Nuclear
extracts (10 Ag) were incubated with 40,000 cpm of 32P-labeled NF-nB
consensus oligonucleotide (5¶-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3¶) and 2 Ag
of poly(deoxyadenylate-deoxythymidylic acid) in a buffer containing 8%

phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a final volume of 20 AL, for 15 min at room
temperature. The complexes were fractionated on 6% native polyacrylamide
gels, run in 1 Tris-borate EDTA buffer (89 mmol/L Tris, 89 mmol/L boric
acid, and 2.0 mmol/L EDTA), dried, and exposed to Kodak X-AR film at
70jC. Competition binding experiments were done by the addition of the
nonradioactive oligonucleotide, in 100-fold molar excess, at the time of
addition of the labeled probe.
DNA fragmentation assay. Cells were plated in 96-well plates 24 h before
treatment. After treatment, DNA fragmentation was evaluated by
examination of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes) using Cell Death Detection ELISAPlus
kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and as we have previously described (29).
Statistical analysis. Due to heterogeneous variability among treatment
groups, the data in Fig. 4C were transformed using logarithm to the base 10
and analyzed using the two-way classification ANOVA. The Fisher least
significant difference procedure was used for multiple comparisons with
Bonferroni adjustment for the number of comparisons. Data were assessed
at the 0.05 level of significance.

Results
NaBT increases PTEN expression in HT29 cells. Treatment with
NaBT induces intestinal cell differentiation, whereas overexpression of PTEN enhances this process (6). To better delineate
upstream signaling pathways responsible for PTEN induction, we
used the human colon cancer cell line HT29, which has wild-type
(i.e., nonmutated) PTEN (30). HT29 is used extensively as a model

of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation (31).
Cells were treated with NaBT (5 mmol/L) for various times and
protein was extracted. Western blotting showed a NaBT-mediated
increase in PTEN expression, which was apparent by 8 h after
treatment and continued for the 48-h time course (Fig. 1A). To
examine whether the induction of PTEN protein was associated
with an increase in mRNA expression, HT29 cells were treated with
NaBT (5 mmol/L) over a time course, and total cellular RNA was
extracted for analysis of PTEN expression by Northern blot. As
shown in Fig. 1B, NaBT increased PTEN mRNA levels compared
with vehicle control, which was apparent by 4 h after treatment
and continued for the 48-h time course. Together, these results
identify induction of PTEN mRNA and protein levels with NaBT
treatment. In spite of the increased mRNA and protein levels in
NaBT-treated cells, a time-dependent decrease of PTEN protein
levels was noted in control cells, which we speculate may be due to
decreased serum concentration over the incubation period (32–34).
To determine whether this induction of PTEN is limited to HT29
cells or occurs in other cells, human colon cancer cell line Caco-2,
normal rat intestinal epithelial cell line RIE-1, and human

embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 were incubated in the presence
or absence of NaBT for 24 h (Fig. 1C). Induction of PTEN protein
expression was noted in all cells. These results confirm our findings
in HT29 cells and, moreover, suggest a general regulation of PTEN
expression by NaBT.
Inhibition of JNK attenuates PTEN induction by NaBT.
Previously, we have shown that treatment with NaBT increased JNK
activity and c-Jun phosphorylation, which was associated with
enterocyte-like differentiation in Caco-2 intestinal cells (6, 20). In
agreement with our results, Orchel et al. (21) have shown that
inhibition of JNK attenuated NaBT-induced differentiation in HT29
cells. To investigate the possible regulatory effect of JNK on PTEN
expression, HT29 cells were pretreated with a selective JNK
inhibitor, SP600125 (35), followed by treatment with NaBT for
4, 8, or 24 h as early as 4 h after treatment with maximal induction
at 24 h. As expected, NaBT increased PTEN protein expression
(Fig. 2A) and mRNA expression (Fig. 2B); this induction was
dramatically attenuated by pretreatment with SP600125. These
results suggest that NaBT-induced PTEN expression requires JNK
activation. Previously, we showed that NaBT increased JNK1

Figure 4. Cross-talk between JNK and NF-nB activation.
A and B, HT29 cells were infected with control adenovirus
encoding GFP or an adenovirus encoding the NF-nB
superrepressor InB-AA (A ) or the p65 NF-nB subunit (B).
After incubation for 24 h, cells were treated with or
without NaBT for an additional 24 h. Whole-cell protein was
extracted for immunoprecipitation with anti-JNK1 or
anti-JNK2 antibody. JNK1 or JNK2 activity was assessed
by an in vitro kinase assay using GST-c-Jun protein as
substrate. JNK1 or JNK2 expression levels were assessed
by Western blotting. C, HT29 cells were transfected with a
NF-nB-luciferase reporter plasmid. Twenty-four hours
after transfection, cells were pretreated with the JNK
inhibitor SP600125 for 30 min followed by treatment with
NaBT for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested and
luciferase activity was assayed. D, HT29 cells were
transfected with siRNA directed to JNK1 plus siRNA
directed to JNK2 or control siRNA. Twenty-four hours after
siRNA transfection, cells were transfected with a
NF-nB-luciferase reporter plasmid. Twenty-four hours
later, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was
assayed. Columns, mean; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05, versus

activity at 8 h and sustained for 72 h after treatment in Caco-2 cells.
To determine if NaBT increases JNK1 and JNK2 activity, HT29 cells
were treated with NaBT and then harvested for in vitro kinase
assays using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-c-Jun as substrate
(Fig. 2C). Increased JNK activity was noted for both JNK1 and JNK2
over the time course (4–48 h).
To further show the role of JNK in NaBT-mediated PTEN
induction, we transfected cells with siRNA directed to either JNK1
or JNK2 to suppress JNK1 and JNK2 expression, respectively. First,
the efficacy of JNK siRNA inhibition was analyzed. JNK1 and JNK2
expression was decreased by f30% at 12 h after transfection with
JNK1 or JNK2 siRNA, respectively, and a 65% decrease was noted
24 h after transfection (Fig. 2D, left). Transfection with siRNA
directed to JNK1 or JNK2 did not affect expression of JNK2 or JNK1,
respectively. Based on these results, we then treated cells with
NaBT 24 h after transfection with siRNA. Suppression of JNK
attenuated NaBT-mediated PTEN induction in HT29 cells as
compared with cells transfected with nontargeting control siRNA
(Fig. 2D, middle and right). Immunoblotting analysis confirmed
that expression of JNK1 or JNK2 was significantly inhibited by JNK1
or JNK2 siRNA for 48 h after transfection. Increased JNK2
expression was noted with NaBT treatment. Transfection of cells
with nontargeting control siRNA had no effect on PTEN expression
(data not shown). Together, our data indicate that JNK1 and JNK2
are important regulators of PTEN expression.
NF-KB regulation of NaBT-mediated PTEN expression in
HT29 cells. We have previously shown an important role for NF-nB
in PTEN regulation (12). We next determined the effect of NaBT on
NF-nB activity. Cells were treated with a single dose of NaBT
(5 mmol/L) and analyzed over a time course; nuclear protein was
extracted and analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA). Treatment with NaBT increased PTEN mRNA expression
from 2 to 48 h after treatment; however, results from EMSA showed
no change in NF-nB binding activity from 2 to 8 h after NaBT
treatment (Fig. 3A, left) and inhibition of NF-nB binding activity
after 24 h (Fig. 3A, right). The specificity of DNA binding was

confirmed by competition assays using unlabeled probe in molar
excess. To further assess the mechanisms involved in NaBTmediated inhibition of NF-nB binding activity, HT29 cells were
treated with NaBT for 24 or 48 h; cytosolic and nuclear protein
were extracted and p65, p50, and InBa expression was detected by
Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3B, the decreased level of p50
expression was noted in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions with no
change in either of p65 or InBa expression. These data indicate
that NaBT inhibition of NF-nB binding activity may be due to
decreased levels of nuclear p50.
To assess the involvement of NF-nB in NaBT-mediated PTEN
regulation, an adenovirus expressing the superrepressor of InB-a
(InB-AA) was used (12). HT29 cells were infected with either the
adenovirus encoding hemagglutinin-tagged InB-AA or the adenoviral control vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP).
Infection was carried out for 1 h followed by the replacement of
fresh medium. After incubation for 24 h, cells were treated with
NaBT for an additional 24 h. As expected, InB-AA overexpression
alone increased PTEN expression and enhanced NaBT-mediated
PTEN induction (Fig. 3C, top); InB-AA expression was confirmed by
Western blot (Fig. 3C, bottom). The inhibition of NF-nB activation
was confirmed by EMSA (data not shown). Conversely, we analyzed
the effect of the expression of the p65 subunit of NF-nB after
infection with the recombinant adenovirus Ad5p65. We found that
overexpression of p65 protein decreased PTEN expression and
attenuated NaBT-induced PTEN expression (Fig. 3D, top); p65
overexpression was confirmed and h-actin expression was
constant, indicating equal protein loading (Fig. 3C, middle and
bottom, respectively). Consistently, NaBT-mediated NF-nB inhibition was reversed by p65 overexpression as shown in Fig. 3E. These
results provide evidence for the involvement of NF-nB in the
regulation of NaBT-mediated PTEN induction.
Cross-talk between JNK and NF-KB in HT29 cells. Next, we
assessed whether NF-nB affects JNK activity in HT29 cells. HT29
cells were infected with adenovirus encoding InB-AA (Fig. 4A),
adenovirus encoding p65 (Fig. 4B), or the adenoviral control vector

adenovirus encoding PTEN. After incubation for 24 h, whole-cell protein was extracted and Western blot was done for analysis of PTEN and p27kip1 protein expression.
B, HT29 cells were transfected with PTEN siRNA or control siRNA duplexes. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with NaBT for an additional
24 h. Whole-cell protein was extracted and Western blot was done for analysis of PTEN and p27kip1 protein expression. C, HT29 cells were infected with an adenovirus
encoding the p65 NF-nB subunit or control adenovirus encoding GFP. After incubation for 24 h, cells were treated with NaBT for an additional 24 h. Total protein was
isolated and Western blot was done for analysis of PTEN protein expression. D, HT29 cells were transfected with JNK1 or JNK2 siRNA. Representative of three
independent experiments.

encoding GFP. Activity of JNK1 or JNK2 was examined using
GST-c-Jun protein as the substrate. NF-nB inhibition by overexpression of InB-AA increased JNK1 and JNK2 activity in HT29
cells, as shown in Fig. 4A. Consistent with these results, NF-nB
activation by overexpression of p65 in HT29 cells decreased basal
JNK1 activity and attenuated NaBT-mediated JNK activation
(Fig. 4B). JNK1 and JNK2 expression levels were not altered with
the transfections as noted in the Western blot (Fig. 4B, bottom).
Because JNK inhibition results in NF-nB activation in multiple
myeloma cell lines (18), we next determined the effect of JNK
inhibition on NF-nB activation by transfection of the NF-nB-luciferase
plasmid, which contains four tandem copies of the NF-nB consensus
sequence. Twenty-four hours after transfection, HT29 cells were
pretreated with or without SP600125 (10 Amol/L) for 30 min followed
by combination treatment with NaBT (5 mmol/L) for an additional
24 h. Treatment with NaBT decreased NF-nB transactivation
compared with control (Fig. 4C). Moreover, treatment with the JNK
inhibitor SP600125 significantly increased NF-nB reporter activity but
only partially attenuated the NaBT-mediated NF-nB repression. NF-nB
activation by JNK inhibition was further confirmed by the increased
NF-nB reporter activity in cells transfected with JNK1 and JNK2 siRNA
as compared with control siRNA transfection (Fig. 4D). Together,
these results identify a negative regulation between JNK and NF-nB
signaling, which plays an important role in the regulation of basal
PTEN expression in HT29 cells.
Regulation of p27kip1 expression through the JNK/PTEN
pathway in NaBT-treated HT29 cells. PTEN increases p27kip1
expression in various cells (4, 5, 36). We have shown that NaBT
increases p27kip1 expression in intestinal cells (37). We next
determined whether elevated PTEN expression contributed to the
increase of p27kip1 expression. First, we assessed the expression of
p27kip1 in HT29 cells overexpressing PTEN. Cells were infected with
adenovirus vectors encoding h-gal (AdCA-LacZ; control) or PTEN
(AdCA-PTEN). Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were lysed
and p27kip1 expression was analyzed by Western blotting. As shown
in Fig. 5A, overexpression of PTEN increased p27kip1 expression. To

further confirm the role of PTEN in p27kip1 regulation, HT29 cells
were transfected with nontargeting control siRNA or siRNA
directed to PTEN. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were
treated with NaBT for an additional 24 h, and PTEN and p27kip1
expression was determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5B ).
Treatment with NaBT increased PTEN and p27kip1 expression. In
agreement with the induction of p27kip1 by overexpression of PTEN,
transfection with PTEN siRNA completely blocked PTEN expression and attenuated p27kip1 induction by NaBT, suggesting a role
for PTEN in p27kip1 regulation in intestinal cells. Knockdown of
PTEN did not completely block NaBT-induced p27kip1 expression,
suggesting that a PTEN-independent pathway(s) is involved in
NaBT-induced p27kip1 expression. In preliminary findings, we have
shown that NaBT treatment increases expression of the forkhead
transcription factor FOXO1; knockdown of FOXO1 attenuated
NaBT-induced p27kip1 expression, suggesting that NaBT regulation
of p27kip1 is through PTEN as well as FOXO1.3
We have shown that NF-nB activation decreased PTEN
expression (12). To determine the effect of NF-nB activation on
p27kip1 expression, HT29 cells were infected with adenovirus
vectors encoding GFP (Ad5GFP; control) or p65 (Ad5p65). Twentyfour hours after infection, cells were treated with NaBT for an
additional 24 h, and p27kip1 expression was analyzed by Western
blot. In agreement with the inhibition of PTEN expression,
overexpression of p65 decreased basal expression of p27kip1 and
attenuated NaBT-induced p27kip1 expression (Fig. 5C).
Given that inhibition of JNK attenuated PTEN expression, we
next determined the effect of JNK knockdown on p27kip1
expression. HT29 cells were transfected with nontargeting control
siRNA or siRNA specifically directed to JNK1 or JNK2. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, cells were treated with NaBT for an
additional 24 h, and JNK1, JNK2, and p27kip1 expression was
assayed by Western blot (Fig. 5D). Treatment with NaBT increased

p27kip1 expression. Transfection with either JNK1 or JNK2 siRNA
attenuated NaBT-mediated p27kip1 induction; the knockdown of
JNK1 or JNK2 was confirmed after treatment with JNK1 or JNK2
siRNA, respectively. Taken together, our findings show that NaBT
induced PTEN through JNK activation and NF-nB inhibition, which
was associated with the induction of p27kip1.
PTEN function in NaBT-induced differentiation and apoptosis. Because PTEN is a potential tumor suppressor for
colorectal cancer (1) and inhibition of PI3K enhances NaBTmediated intestinal cell differentiation (6), we analyzed the role of
PTEN in NaBT-induced differentiation in HT29 cells. Treatment
with NaBT increased intestinal alkaline phosphatase activity
(Fig. 6A), a differentiation marker for intestinal cells (6), and this
increase was attenuated by transfection of siRNA directed to PTEN,
suggesting a role for PTEN in NaBT-mediated differentiation.
Previously, we have found that inhibition of PI3K enhances
NaBT-mediated apoptosis in human colon cancer cells (29). Next,
we accessed the effect of PTEN knockdown on NaBT-induced HT29
cell death. NaBT induced obvious cell death as shown by increased

or control siRNA duplexes. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were
treated with NaBT for an additional 40 h. Whole-cell proteins were extracted
and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP ) enzymatic activities in the HT29 cells
with or without doxycycline were analyzed. B, after transfection with PTEN
siRNA or control siRNA, HT29 cells were treated with NaBT (5 mmol/L) for 24 h.

DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6B), and this increase was attenuated by
knockdown of PTEN using PTEN siRNA transfection. Collectively,
our results suggest that PTEN plays a role in NaBT-mediated
intestinal cell death and differentiation.

Discussion
In previous studies, we showed enhanced intestinal cell
differentiation by PTEN (6) and defined a novel feedback regulation
of PTEN by NF-nB activation (12). In the present study, we further
delineated the signaling pathways involved in this regulation. We
show that NaBT, which induces intestinal cell differentiation,
increased PTEN expression. This NaBT-mediated PTEN induction
was a consequence of NF-nB inhibition and JNK activation. Finally,
we show that NaBT increased p27kip1 expression, a downstream
target of PTEN by regulation of NF-nB and JNK. Importantly,
our findings identify regulation of PTEN by JNK and NF-nB in
intestinal cells.
Recently, we have shown that treatment with NaBT induced
intestinal cell differentiation, which was associated with the
activation of JNK (20). Conversely, inhibition of JNK attenuated
NaBT-induced intestinal cell differentiation (21). JNK activity has
been associated with intestinal cell death. For instance, TNFainduced apoptosis in IEC-6 intestinal cells was accompanied by the
activation of JNK, and inhibition of JNK protected against TNFainduced apoptosis (38). Inhibition of JNK attenuated hydrogen
peroxide–induced cell death in HT29 cells (39). Consistently, our
previous results showed that overexpression of PTEN enhanced
intestinal cell differentiation (6). Overexpression of PTEN in
colorectal cancer cells resulted in cell cycle arrest and enhanced
cell death through inhibition of PI3K (40). Our observation that the
blockade of the JNK pathway by pharmacologic (i.e., SP600125) or
genetic (i.e., transfection with JNK siRNA) mechanisms attenuated
NaBT induction of PTEN strongly argues for a functional role for
JNK activation in PTEN induction in intestinal cells.
Although in some cells (e.g., leukemia cells), histone deacetylase
inhibitor exposure has been associated with NF-nB activation (41),
several reports have shown inactivation of NF-nB by NaBT in
intestinal epithelial cells (42, 43). In agreement with these reports,
we also showed an inhibitory role of NaBT in NF-nB activity in
HT29 cells. Although NaBT has been shown to decrease p50 in
nuclear but not in cytosolic fractions of HT29 cells 12 h after NaBT
treatment (44), our results showed that NaBT reduced p50 in both
nuclear and cytosolic fractions with NaBT treatment for 48 h. NaBT
inhibits TNFa-induced NF-nB activation, in part, by preventing the
complete degradation of InBa by reducing proteasome activity
(42); however, our results showed that NaBT alone did not affect
InBa expression in HT29 cells. Because NF-nB inhibition resulted
in the induction of PTEN expression, our results strongly suggest
the involvement of NF-nB inhibition in NaBT-mediated PTEN
induction.
Several studies have reported a cross-talk between the NF-nB
and JNK pathways (45, 46). The NF-nB–mediated inhibition of
JNK signaling is crucial for numerous physiologic processes, such
as the response of the liver to injury and the survival of cells
during an inflammatory reaction, as well as for chronic
inflammatory diseases and cancers (16). In contrast, it has been
reported that inhibition of NF-nB leads to JNK activation and
potentiates the lethality of certain apoptotic stimuli (e.g., TNFa;
ref. 47). The importance of this antagonistic cross-talk between
NF-nB and JNK has also been documented recently in animal

models (44). In agreement with these findings, we showed that
inhibition of NF-nB or treatment with NaBT resulted in JNK
activation. Activation of NF-nB decreased JNK activity, whereas
inhibition of JNK increased NF-nB activity. Therefore, our results
reveal a possible cross-talk mechanism by NF-nB and JNK on
PTEN regulation in intestinal cells. Nevertheless, this mechanism
may not contribute completely to NaBT-induced PTEN expression because our results show that JNK inhibition does not
reverse NaBT-mediated NF-nB inhibition. Furthermore, NaBT
increased JNK activity and, at the same time, did not affect NF-nB
binding activity from 2 to 8 h. These results suggest that NF-nB
and JNK are differentially involved in the regulation of NaBTmediated PTEN expression. Our results show that JNK is involved
at early time points and, together with NF-nB, at later stages in
the regulation of NaBT-mediated expression.
NaBT induces intestinal cell differentiation associated with the
induction of p27kip1 expression (37). The function of p27kip1 is
required for intestinal cell differentiation (48). Overexpression of
PTEN or inhibition of PI3K increased p27kip1 expression in various
cells (4, 5). Considering that intestinal cell differentiation was
enhanced by PTEN overexpression, we determined whether JNK
activation increased p27kip1 and, if so, whether this effect was
through JNK-dependent PTEN expression. We found that overexpression of PTEN or treatment with NaBT increased p27kip1
expression in HT29 cells; this induction was attenuated by
transfection with PTEN siRNA, activation of NF-nB, or inhibition
of JNK by transfection with JNK1 or JNK2 siRNA. Our findings show
that NaBT increased p27kip1 expression through PTEN induction,
which was mediated by JNK activation and NF-nB inhibition.

Previously, we showed that inhibition of PI3K or overexpression of
PTEN increased TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)
expression in intestinal cells (22); TRAIL treatment results in
increased intestinal cell differentiation and p27kip1 expression (49).
Recently, Yanase et al. (50) showed that activation of JNK leads to
TRAIL induction in Daudi B lymphoma cells. Our future studies
will determine the regulation of TRAIL expression by the JNK/
PTEN pathway and the possible relationship to intestinal cell
differentiation.
In summary, our current study provides important insights
about the signaling mechanisms regulating PTEN expression and
function in intestinal cells. Our results identify PTEN as a
downstream target of the JNK and NF-nB pathway. Given the
importance of p27kip1 in intestinal cell differentiation, JNK/PTEN
and NF-nB/PTEN pathways may alter intestinal cell differentiation
through the regulation of p27kip1 expression. Collectively, our
results have important implications for normal intestinal homeostasis and colon carcinogenesis.
