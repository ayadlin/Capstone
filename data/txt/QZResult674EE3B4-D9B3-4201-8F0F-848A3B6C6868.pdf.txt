ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is known as a common malignant neoplasm worldwide.
The role of EGFR/HER2 in CRC is unclear. Afatinib is an irreversible EGFR/HER2
inhibitor. There were few studies of afatinib on CRC. Here, we investigated the protein
levels/expressions of HER2 in sera and tumors from CRC patients and the therapeutic
effect of afatinib on HER2-overexpressed CRC in vitro and in vivo. The increased
HER2 levels were detected in the collected sera and tumors of patients with CRC.
The serological HER2 levels were correlated with the tumor HER2 expressions in
patients. Afatinib also inhibited the HER2-positive tumor cell growth and caused
apoptosis in HER2-overexpressed human colorectal cancer HCT-15 cells but not in
low HER2 expressed human gastric cancer MKN45 cells. In vivo study showed that
afatinib reduced tumor growth in HER2-overexpressed xenografts. Moreover, afatinibencapsulated micelles displayed higher cytotoxic activity in HCT-15 cells and were
more effective for tumor growth suppression in HCT-15-induced tumor xenografts
than afatinib performance alone. Taken together, these findings suggest that higher
serum HER2 levels reflect the higher HER2 contents in tumors of CRC patients, and the
improved afatinib-encapsulated micelles possess high therapeutic efficacy in HER2overexpressed CRC in vitro and in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

for tumor therapy, but is still not capable of preventing
recurrence of CRC in patients [4]. Monoclonal antibodies
and other biologicals, targeting tumor-associated proteins
and blocking essential processes of the tumor, were
extensively studied. A crucial step in this process is
the identification of tumor specific proteins that can be
targeted by these compounds.
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/
ErbB2) is a receptor tyrosine kinase member of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family [5, 6].
HER2/ErbB2 contains an extracellular ligand binding

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major worldwide
health problem with high incidence and mortality [1-3]. In
present, CRC accompanied with higher mortal­ity is due to
the disease that is frequently diagnosed in the advanced
stage without reliable biomarkers. In order to decrease
the mortality of CRC, searching for CRC biomarkers is
urgent and important. In advance, developing targeted
therapy can also effectively reduce mortality. In the past,
chemotherapy has been shown to be an efficient strategy

domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular
tyrosine kinase domain [7]. Kinase activity of HER2 is
activated upon receptor dimerization, either with the
homo- or hetero-dimerization [8]. Till now, the specific
biological ligands to HER2 have not been identified yet.
The conformational change and auto-phosphorylation
of the intracellular domain of HER2 can lead to
downstream signaling via mitogen-activated protein
kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phospholipase C,
protein kinase C, and signal transducer and activator of
transcription for mediating tumor growth, differentiation,
and survival [9-13]. HER2 overexpression leads to
increased proliferation, angiogenesis, and reduced
apoptosis. The overexpressed HER2 has been discovered
in a number of human cancers, including in breast
cancer [14-16], gastric cancer [17], ovarian cancer [18],
and salivary gland carcinoma [19]. HER2 has attracted
considerable attention in breast cancer and gastric cancer,
where it has been targeted successfully in the treatment
of patients with advanced stage [20, 21]. In both cancers,
trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, has
been shown to significantly improve therapeutic efficacy
and survival in patients with HER2-postive tumors [20,
21]. However, HER2 as a therapeutic target in CRC has
been investigated with controversial results [22-25]. The
role of EGFR/HER2 in CRC still remains to be clarified.
Afatinib (BIBW 2992), an irreversible EGFR/
HER2 inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in the
elimination of cancer cells with HER2 gene mutations
in preclinical lung cancer models [26]. Several clinical
trials of afatinib have been investigated in patients
with advanced solid tumors [27]. In a clinical trial, the
clinical activity of afatinib has been shown in patients
with lung adenocarcinoma with HER2 gene mutation
[28]. However, the therapeutic potential of afatinib on
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HER2-overexpressed CRC remains to be clarified. In
this study, we aimed to investigate the levels of HER2 in
sera and tumors from CRC patients and the therapeutic
effects of afatinib on CRC with high HER2 expression
in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, nanoparticulate drug
delivery systems have attracted increasing attention for
diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancers [29,
30]. Nano-carriers enable the preferential delivery of
chemotherapeutic agents into the tumor foci due to the
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) [31]. Micelles
are of particular interest in tumor applications due to their
suitable size, biocompatibility, and hydrophobic core,
which is emerging as powerful drug delivery vehicles
for loading hydrophobic drugs [32]. Here, we also tried
to test whether afatinib-encapsulated polymeric micelles
(afatinib/micelles) can increase the therapeutic effect of
afatinib in HER2-overexpressed tumors.

RESULTS
HER2 levels in serum and tumor tissue of CRC
patients
There were about 25% (8/31) of CRC patients
showing high-level sHER2 more than the average of
HER2 concentration in disease group (Figure 1A),
which was consistent with the results found in breast
cancer patients [14-16]. The clinical characteristics of
CRC patients were shown in Table 1. Moreover, protein
expressions of HER2 in tumor tissues from patients with
low- and high-level sHER2 were detected. As shown in
Figure 1B, the protein expressions of HER2 in tumors
were higher in patients with high-level sHER2 than in
4869

patients with low-level sHER2. The protein expressions of
HER2 were also measured in tumor and non-tumor tissues
from patients with high-level sHER2. The results showed
that higher HER2 expressions were observed in tumor
tissues than in non-tumor tissues (Figure 1C). We also
observed that the levels of sHER2 are positively correlated
with that of tumor HER2 in CRC patients (p<0.05, Figure
1D), considering that measurement of sHER2 may be
used to reflect the levels of HER2 in tumors as a reference
during cancer therapy.

whereas MKN45 as a low-expression HER2 model.
Compared to MKN45 cells, the tumor cell viabilities
were significantly decreased by lower concentrations of
afatinib (10 ng/ml-10 μg/ml) in HER2-overexpressed
HCT-15 and AGS cells (Figure 2B). The cell viabilities
of AGS and HCT-15 were significantly decreased by
10 μg/ml of afatinib about 20% and 40%, respectively
(Figure 2C). Moreover, afatinib significantly increased
cell apoptosis in HCT-15 cells as compared with MKN45
cells determined by Annexin V-FITC/PI double-labeled
flow cytometry (Figure 3A) and TUNEL assay (Figure
3B). Then, we further observed whether mitochondrial
dysfunction resulted in afatinib-induced apoptosis.
Because the majority of ATP production takes place in
the mitochondrial the ATP production is an indicator for
detecting mitochondrial function. As shown in Figure 3C,
intracellular ATP levels were significantly decreased in
afatinib-treated HCT-15 cells.

Cytotoxic effects of afatinib on tumor cells with or
without HER2 overexpression
In order to establish an HER2-overexpressed cell
model, the protein expressions of HER2 were detected in
several kinds of cancer cells, including breast (MCF-7),
prostate (PC-3), gastric (AGS and MKN45), colorectal
(HCT-15), lung (A549), hepatocellular (HepG2), and
esophageal (Yen4) tumor cells. As shown in Figure 2A,
overexpressed HER2 was found in MCF-7, PC-3, HCT-15,
HepG2, AGS, and Yen4 cells. To investigate the specific
therapeutic effects of afatinib in tumors, AGS and HCT15 cells were chosen as high-expression HER2 models,

Next, the images of HER2 expression were detected
in MKN45- and HCT-15-induced xenografts in mice.

Afatinib encapsulated by polymeric micelles
increases the therapeutic efficacy of afatinib

The fluorescence signals were significantly increased
in the HCT-15-induced xenograft mice as compared
with MKN45-induced xenografts (Figure 4A). The
distributions of HER2 in several organs of HCT-15induced xenografts were also detected. Tumor tissue
possessed higher fluorescence signal as compared with
other organs (Figure 4B). The protein overexpression of
HER2 was also observed in tumor tissue determined by
Western blotting, which was consistent with the results
of fluorescence imaging (Figure 4C). Furthermore, to
evaluate the antitumor effect of afatinib in vivo, the
xenograft mouse model transplanted with HCT-15 cells
(high-expression HER2) or MKN45 cells (low-expression
HER2) was established. Afatinib had no inhibitory effect
on the tumor growth of MKN45-induced xenografts
(Figures 5A and 5C). However, the tumor growth of HCT15-induced xenografts was significantly inhibited by
afatinib treatment (Figures 5B and 5C). The tumor volume
was also significantly decreased by 60% in afatinib-treated
HCT-15-induced xenografts; whereas no effect of afatinib
was observed in MKN45-induced xenografts (Figure 5D).

In order to improve the therapeutic efficacy of
afatinib, the polymeric micelles-encapsulated drug
system consisting of amphiphilic block copolymers and
afatinib (afatinib/micelles) was synthesized (Figure 6A).
The sizes of afatinib/micelles were 160 ± 32 nm and
determined by a dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Figure
6B). To detect the stability of afatinib/micelles, the size
of afatinib/micelles in various pH conditions (pH = 5.5,
7.4, and 9) was measured. The result indicated that the
size of afatinib/micelles was no difference for 3 days and
were decreased significantly after 4 days (Figure 6C). To
observe the in vitro release kinetics of afatinib/micelles,
the modified dialysis method was performed. The results
showed that free afatinib exhibited a very fast release
rate, whereas afatinib/micelles showed sustained release
behavior (Figure 6D). In the first 24 hours, 85.2 ± 5.3%
and 24.9 ± 4.6% of afatinib were released from the free
afatinib and afatinib/micelles groups, respectively (P <

0.05). Furthermore, the measurement of afatinib/micelles
release behavior showed that a time for 50% of afatinib
release (t1/2) was approximately at 72 h and the majority of
drug (>80%) was released in a 144-hour period.
Afatinib/micelles treatment showed higher
decrease in cell viability of HCT-15 cells than afatinib
alone treatment (Figure 7A). However, the micelles
alone treatment showed non-cytotoxicity in HCT-15 as
compared to PBS treatment (Figure 7B). Furthermore, a
flow cytometric analysis was performed to observe the
level of apoptosis after afatinib/micelles or afatinib alone
treatment in HCT-15 cells. The results indicated that cell
apoptosis was significantly increased in afatinib/micellestreated tumor cells as compared with afatinib alone
treatment (Figure 7C). To understand the distribution of
afatinib/micelles in in vivo xenografts, a fluorescent dye
DiR, was encapsulated in micelles (DiR/micelles). The
fluorescence images showed that micelles are accumulated
in tumor of HCT-15-induced xenograft as compared with
control mice (Figure 7D). The micelles alone treatment
indicated that the growth of tumor tissues was no
difference in HCT-15-induced xenografts as compared
with PBS treatment (Figure 7E). Afatinib/micelles

treatment could also significantly increase the inhibition of
tumor growth in HCT-15-induced xenografts as compared
with afatinib alone treatment (Figure 7F). These results
indicated that micelles can carry afatinib into tumor tissues
and consequently improve the therapeutic efficacy.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we first evaluated HER2 as a CRC
biomarker and found that serological HER2 (sHER2)
levels are correlated with tumor tissue HER2 levels
in clinical CRC patients. We also found that afatinib
effectively inhibits tumor cell growth of CRC with
high-expression HER2 in vitro and in vivo. Afatinib
could cause cell apoptosis in HER2-overexpressed CRC
cells through the induction of mitochondrial toxicity.
In addition, afatinib-encapsulated polymeric micelles
significantly increased the therapeutic efficacy of afatinib
on HER2-overexpressed CRC in vitro and in vivo. These
findings suggest that afatinib effectively inhibits HER2overexpressed CRC cell growth and the afatinib/micelles
significantly increase the accumulation of afatinib in tumor
tissues and improve the therapeutic efficacy of afatinib in

HER2-overexpressed CRC tumors.
HER2 is known as a critical target in therapy and
diagnosis for breast cancer, which occurs in 20-30% of
the breast cancer population. The levels of serum HER2
as well as tumor tissue HER2 have been detected to be
increased in the patients with breast cancer [33]. In clinical
practice,immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence
in situ hybridisation (FISH) are the suggested methods
to determine HER2 status in cancer specimens [33, 34].
Currently, FDA has approved several kits or assays of
IHC or FISH to determine HER2 expression. Even though
the techniques present highly standardized and semiquantitative assay, IHC has been shown to have numerous
limitations, including operative and illustrative difficulties
without quantitative measurements, which may lead to the
low reproducibility and accuracy. Moreover, the procedure
of IHC is complicated and time-consuming, which are
undesirable for detection in a lot of clinical samples. FISH
is considered to be a “gold standard” technique with high
sensitivity and accuracy in recognize HER2 expression in
tumor samples, but it is expensive and lacks standardized
quantitative system for distinguishing HER2 expression.
In this study, we observed that the average serological
HER2 (sHER2) levels are increased in CRC patients
(~25% above average), which are correlated with tumor
tissue HER2 expressions. These results implied that the
serum HER2 levels determined by ELISA assay may
be a profitable and invasive tool for diagnosing HER2
expression in CRC patients.
Afatinib is known as a first-line FDA-approved
drug for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations, which is a
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) not only against EGFR
mutations but also inhibit HER2-overexpressed breast
cancer. Lin et al. observed that there are about 46%
patients with overexpressed HER2 achieving benefit
from afatinib treatment in the phase II and III trials [35].
Moreover, a previous study has shown that afatinib causes
antitumor activity in HER2-overexpressed gastric cancer
in vivo [36]. Li et al. have indicated that afatinib shows
lower half-maximal inhibitory concentrations for in vitro
potency against HER2 than that of lapatinib, another dual
tyrosine kinase inhibitor [26]. In this study, we observed
that afatinib causes cytotoxicity in HER2-overexpressed
HCT-15 cell, and suppressed HCT-15-induced tumor
growth in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, afatinib may be a
potential agent in Her2-postive colorectal cancer therapy.
In this study, we showed that afatinib can induce
cell apoptosis in HER2-overexpressed human colorectal
cancer cells, which is consistent with the results in HER2postive gastric and breast cancer cells [36, 37]. Lapatinib
has been shown to inhibit the HER2 downstream signaling
pathways RAF/MEK/ERK (ERK cascade) and PI3K/
AKT/mTOR and lead to up-regulations of BIM (BCL2–interacting mediator of cell death) and BID (BCL-2
antagonist of cell death) in HER2-overexpressed breast
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer cells [38]. In addition, lapatinib also induced
reactive oxygen species-dependent endoplasmic reticulum
stress to decrease mitochondrial function in breast cancer
cells [38]. Our results also showed that afatinib causes
the mitochondrial toxicity in HER2-overexpressed
human colorectal cancer cells (HCT-15). As we know,
the mitochondrial toxicity could induce permeabilization
of the mitochondrial outer membrane and then triggers
cytochrome c release for apoptosis induction.
Another goal in this study was to create the micellescarried afatinib to improve the therapeutic efficacy of this
drug. We found that afatinib encapsulated with polymeric
micelles (afatinib/micelles) can improve the therapeutic
efficacy in HER2-overexpressed HCT-15-induced
tumors. Micelles have emerged as an important potential
drug delivery vehicle for chemotherapy drugs and small
molecule compounds in tumor therapy application. The
therapeutic efficacy of these agents can be significantly
improved when their circulation longevity and tumor site
accumulation properties are increased through micelles
encapsulation. The biocompatible micelles were suitable
to carry hydrophobic drug such as afatinib for tumor
therapy. Blanco et al. have demonstrated that β-lapachone
encapsulated with polymeric micelles (β-lapachone/
micelles) significantly suppress tumor volume and
increase survival in a lung cancer model [39]. Currently,
several polymeric micelles-formulated antitumor drugs
were investigated in clinical trials, including paclitaxel,
cisplatin, doxorubicin, and SN-38 [40-43]. Previous study
has indicated that tumor vessels have large endothelial
fenestrations ranging in size from 100 to 600 nm [44].
However, the large particle size (>220) will not be able
to pass through the fenestrations between the tumor
endothelial cells [45] and small particles (<10 nm) are
rapidly excreted by the kidney [46]. The size of afatinib/
micelles is about 92 nm, which accumulated in tumor
tissues. Interestingly, we observed that afatinib/micelles
(1-5 μg/ml) reveal more cytotoxicity than afatinib alone
in vitro. The micelles may increase the uptake of afatinib
through endocytosis in tumors, whereas afatinib may
enter into tumor cells through diffusion [47]. Moreover,
nanoparticles can reduce the drug resistance, hence to
increase the therapeutic effect [48]. Therefore, in this
study, afatinib/micelles produced not only the increased
afatinib solubility in biology, but also the enhanced
accumulation in tumors. Therefore, afatinib/micelles may
be a potential drug system for HER2-overexpressed CRC
therapy in clinical.
In this study, the micelles distribution imaging
showed that afatinib/micelles accumulated not only
in tumors but also in liver and spleen. Moreover, it has
been indicated that nano-size particles such as liposome,
dendrimer, and gold nanoparticle have been proposed
to occur by uptake of the carrier by the mononuclear
phagocyte system (MPS)/reticuloendothelial system
(RES) recognition [49]. Even though the MPS uptake of
4875

Cell lines

nanoparticle caused rapid removal from the blood and
accumulated in liver irreversibly, afatinib/micelles showed
a less cytotoxicity response in normal liver cells and the
expression of HER2 in liver was lower than in tumors
(data not shown). The histological examination revealed
that normal morphology in liver treated with afatinib/
micelles was observed. Therefore, we considered that the
afatinib micelles are less cytotoxicity in liver tissue.
The strength of this manuscript might be enhanced
considerably if the studies focused on the clinical
responses of the colorectal cancer patients to afatinib
with some mechanistic details. However, at present, Food
and Drug Administration in Taiwan has not yet permitted
afatinib treatment in CRC patients. Therefore, it’s difficult
to acquire the afatinib-treated samples from CRC patients
for studying the mechanism on clinical responses of CRC
patients to afatinib. Our in vitro study indicated that HER2
expression was significantly decreased in afatinib-treated
HCT-15 cells (data not shown). Therefore, we suggested
that afatinib might inhibit HER2 expression for decreasing
cell proliferation in CRC cells and tumors. In this study,
we attend to detect the efficiency of afatinib and afatinib/
micelle in Her2-overexpressed CRC cells and tumors for
a pre-clinical feasibility study.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that HER2 is a
CRC therapeutic target, and the measurement of serum
HER2 may be a potential tool for detecting HER2
expression in CRC. Afatinib can specifically inhibit
HER2-overexpressed CRC cell growth in vitro and in vivo.
Afatinib-encapsulated micelles displayed higher cytotoxic
activity in HCT-15 cells and were more effective for tumor
growth suppression in HCT-15-induced tumor xenografts
than afatinib performance alone. Regarding afatinib/
micelles as an anti-tumor drug in HER2-overexpressed
CRC therapy, other HER2-overexpressed cancer such as
gastric or ovarian tumor could be a candidate in the future.

Human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549),
human breast cancer cells (MCF7), human prostate
cancer cells (PC3), rat pancreatic tumor cells (AR42J),
human gastric cancer cells (MKN45), human colorectal
carcinoma cells (HCT-15), human hepatocellular
carcinoma cells (HepG2), human gastric adenocarcinoma
cells (AGS) were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in ATCC’s
recommended culture medium with 10% of fetal bovine
serum. The esophageal cancer cells (Yen4) were obtained
from Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taiwan and cultured
in DMEM medium with 10% of fetal bovine serum. All
cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2.

Animals
Male nude mice were obtained from National
Laboratory Animal Center, Taiwan. The 8-week-old mice
were selected and housed on a 12-h light cycle at 22 °C
and given food (mouse standard diet) or water ad libitum.
All animal studies were approved by the institutive ethical
review committee and were carried out in accordance
with government regulations and NIH guidelines on the
care and welfare of laboratory animals. All animals were
sacrificed and then isolated the organs including brain,
heart, liver, kidney, spleen, stomach and intestines after
measuring body weight and tumor volume.

Human Serum HER2 assay
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
system (eBioscience, USA) was performed to measure the
human serum HER2 (sHER2) levels in the clinical serum
samples (31 colorectal cancer patients and 26 control
participants). Measurements were performed strictly
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and quality
control was ensured.

METHODS
Acquisition of the tissues of colorectal cancer

Cellular viability assay

Clinical samples were obtained from Cheng Hsin
General Hospital, Taiwan and written informed consent
and previous approval by the Institutional Review Board
(CHGH-IRB-(240) 100-01) from CRC patients (n =
31) and healthy volunteer (n = 26). The pairs of tissues
including tumors (T) and adjacent non-tumors (NT) from
the individuals of CRC were captured followed by surgery.
Tumor histopathology, grade, and stage were assigned
according to the rules of American Joint Commission on
Cancer Staging (AJCCS) system.

Cellular viability was determined by using WST8 assay (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). The cells were cultured
in 96-well plates at 37°C and 5% CO2. After 24 hours
pre-incubation, each well (1×104 cells) was treated with
afatinib or afatinib-encapsulated polymeric micelles
(afatinib/micelles) or micelles alone for 24 hours and then
10 μl of WST-8 solution was added to each well. After 3
hour-incubation at 37°C, the samples were measured using
a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA).

TUNEL assay

20 mM propidium iodide (PI) for 30 min. Apoptosis was
evaluated by Annexin V-FITC staining with or without
propidium iodide (PI). The cells were washed and
harvested for flow cytometric analysis by FACSCalibur
Flow Cytometer (BD Bioscience, USA).

Cells were seeded in Millicell EZ slide (8 well)
(Merck Millipore, Germany) with cultured medium for 12
hours at 37°C and 5% CO2. Then the cells were treated
with afatinib or afatinib/micelles for 24 hours in 37°C
and 5% CO2. After cell fixation, the cell apoptosis was
measured by using the TUNEL assay system (Promega,
USA) according to a manufacturer’s instruction.

Afatinib/micelles synthesis and characterization
The 1,1’-dioctadecyltetramethyl indotricarbocyanine
iodide (DiR) is a lipophilic carbocyanine dye. DiR-loaded
micelles (DiR/micelles) were prepared via the co-solvent
evaporation method as previously described [50]. Briefly,
a mixture of 54 mg of MPEG-PCL and 6 mg of MalPEG-PCL in a ratio of 9:1 was dissolved in acetone with
3 mg of DiR dye (D/P = 1/20), and then added into saline
while stirring with a rotor-stator device (VARIOMAG
POLY 15, H+P Labortechnik AG, Germany). The organic
solvent was evaporated while stirred overnight and then
filtered through a Millex GS filter (pore size 0.22 μm) to
remove non-incorporated drug crystals and copolymer
aggregates. To produce afatinib/micelles, 10 mg of
afatinib was dissolved in 1 mL of acetone and 20 μL of
triethylamine (TEA) and stirred overnight. The afatinib
solution was then mixed with 90 mg of MPEG-PCL and
10 mg of Mal-PEG-PCL (afatinib/PPLA ratio = 1/10). The
mixed solution was added into saline, and the procedure
described for making nanoparticles was performed. The
mean diameters and polydispersity of micelles were
measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS, DelsaTM
Nano Particle Analyzer, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA,
USA). The free DiR and afatinib were removed through a
Sephadex G-25 column and eluted with 0.15 M of NaCl
buffer (pH = 7). The particle average size distribution of
prepared afatinib/micelles was characterized by using a
dynamic light scattering (DLS, DelsaTM Nano Particle
Analyzer, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).

Mitochondrial function assay
Measurement of tumor cell mitochondrial function
was performed in triplicate using the luminescence ATP
detection system (PerkinElmer, USA). It is a cell-based
assay method that employs a sequential addition to
measure ATP as an indicator of mitochondrial function
for predicting potential mitochondrial dysfunction as
a result of xenobiotic exposure. Cells were cultured in
96-well plates at 37°C and 5% CO2. After 24 hours preincubation, each well (1×104 cells) was treated with 10
μg/ml of afatinib for 24 hours. Cells were then lysed and
used for ATP concentration measurements according to a
manufacturer’s instruction. Results were normalized to
protein content.

Immunoblotting
Cells and tissues were lysed in the buffer containing
150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH8.0). The 15 g of protein samples was diluted in 2X
Laemmli sample buffer (final concentrations: 75 mM Tris
pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% SDS (w/v), 0.002% (w/v)
bromophenol blue) and separated by the 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and
then transferred onto the Immobilon P membranes (Merck
Millipore, Germany). These membranes were blocked in
blocking buffer (Goal Bio, USA) in for 1 min at room
temperature. Membranes were incubated with primary
antibodies overnight at 4°C, and then washed four times
in Tris buffered saline with 0.1 % tween-20 (TBST) for
10 min. After washing, membranes were incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(diluted 1: 3000) for 1 hour at 4°C. The immunoreactive
complexes were detected by ECL (Bio-Rad, USA) and
monitored with a LAS-4000 mini (Fuji Film, Japan).

Afatinib/micelles stability and afatinib release in
vitro
To investigate the stability of afatinib/micelles, the
size distribution of afatinib/micelles was measured to
observe the variation of particles diameter based on pH
of the solvent. Briefly, the freeze-dried afatinib/micelles
were dissolved in aqueous solvent with different pH: 5.5,
7.4, and 9 at 37°C. Then, we measured the changes in
the diameter of afatinib/micelles in an aqueous solution
over time (up to 4 days). Samples (300 μl) were collected
from the stock solution and analyzed by using DLS. For
afatinib release assay, one mg of freeze-dried afatinib/
micelles were dissolved in PBS buffer (1 ml) and injected
into a dialysis bag with the molecular weight cutoff value
of 1 kDa, and dialyzed against 15 ml absolute alcohol and
shaken at 37°C. The outer solution containing released
afatinib was collected at predetermined time points

Flow cytometry (FCM) analysis
MKN45 and HCT-15 cells were seeded at 8 × 105
cells/ml in 6-cm dish, which were incubated either alone
or in the presence of afatinib or afatinib/micelles at 10 μg/
ml for 24 hours. After 24-hour incubation, media were
removed and washed with PBS, and then incubated with

and replaced with 15 mL of fresh absolute alcohol. The
amount of the released afatinib was measured using UVVis spectrophotometer (V-650, JASCO, USA) at a 289 nm
wavelength and calculated on the basis of a calibration
curve using different concentrations of free afatinib in
absolute alcohol. The experiment was carried out in
triplicate.

three groups: vehicle control (n = 5), afatinib (n = 5), and
afatinib/micelles (n = 5) in HCT-15 cell inoculated mice.
Mice were treated once for every three days with either
vehicle (normal saline), afatinib (5 mg/kg body weight,
i.v.), and afatinib micelles (5 mg/kg body weight, i.v.) for
9 days. Tumor growth was externally measured using a
digital caliper, and tumor volumes were calculated using
the formula (width2 × length), where the width represents
the smaller tumor diameter. Tumors were expatriated
from mice at the end of the study and tumor weight was
recorded.

In vivo HER2 and micelles distribution imaging
The HER2 and micelles distribution imagings
were performed in MKN45 or HCT-15 xenograft model.
MKN45 or HCT-15 cells (2 × 106) were subcutaneously
(s.c.) inoculated into the right flank of nude mice (n
= 5 per each group). Tumors were established for
10 days before the imaging assay. For in vivo HER2
imaging assay, the HER2-detected agent labeled with
fluorescent (HER2SenseTM 645, PerkinElmer, USA) was
intravenously (i.v.) injected into tail vein of MKN45 or
HCT-15 xenograft model for 24 h. For in vivo micelles
imaging assay, the DiR/micelles were intravenously
injected into tail vein of HCT-15 xenograft mouse for 24
hours. In vivo imaging system (IVIS, PerkinElmer, USA)
was performed to capture the imaging for detecting HER2
or micelles distribution. After whole body imaging assay,
all animals were sacrificed and then isolated the organs
including tumor, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, stomach
and intestines for IVIS detection. Then all organs were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were stored
at -80°C and analyzed for Western blotting within 3 days.

Statistical analysis
The Western blotting bands were quantified by
densitometric analysis using Multi Gauge v3.2 software.
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
V5.01 software (GraphPad Software, Inc. USA). All
analyses of rodent data with more than two groups were
performed by ANOVA followed by post hoc analysis with
Bonferroni’s test. Student’s t test was used to compare
two groups where appropriate. Data were presented as
mean ± SD. Differences between means were considered
signification when p value <0.05.

REFERENCES

In vivo antitumor effects of afatinib or afatinib/
micelles were observed on male BALB/c Nude mice,
which subcutaneously inoculated with MKN45 or HCT15 cells (2 × 106 /ml). Body weight and tumor appearance
were observed once for every three days for 14 days. For
the effect of afatinib on HER2 expression, mice were
randomly distributed into two groups: vehicle control
(n = 5) and afatinib (n = 5) in MKN45 or HCT-15 cell
inoculated mice. Mice were treated once for every three
days with either vehicle (normal saline) or afatinib (5
mg/kg body weight, i.v.) for 9 days. To detect the effects
of micelles alone on CRC tumor growth, mice were
randomly distributed in two groups: vehicle control (n =
5) and micelles alone (n = 5) in HCT-15 cell inoculated
mice. Mice were treated once for every three days with
either vehicle (normal saline) and micelles (5 mg/kg body
weight, i.v.) for 9 days. Tumor growth was externally
measured using a digital caliper, and tumor volumes
were calculated using the formula (width2 × length),
where the width represents the smaller tumor diameter.
For comparing antitumor effects between afatinib and
afatinib/micelles, mice were randomly distributed in
