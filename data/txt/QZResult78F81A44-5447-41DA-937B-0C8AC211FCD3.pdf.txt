ABSTRACT
The p53/MDM2 interaction has been a well-studied target for new drug design
leading to the development of the small molecule inhibitor Nutlin-3. Our objectives
were to combine Nutlin-3 with cisplatin (CDDP), a well-known activator of the p53
pathway, in a series of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines in order to increase the
cytotoxic response to CDDP. We report that sequential treatment (CDDP followed by
Nutlin-3), but not simultaneous treatment, resulted in strong synergism. Combination
treatment induced p53’s transcriptional activity, resulting in increased mRNA and
protein levels of MDM2, p21, PUMA and BAX. In addition we report the induction of a
strong p53 dependent apoptotic response and induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest. The
strongest synergistic effect was observed at low doses of both CDDP and Nutlin-3,
which could result in fewer (off-target) side effects while maintaining a strong
cytotoxic effect. Our results indicate a promising preclinical potential, emphasizing
the importance of the applied treatment scheme and the presence of wild type p53
for the combination of CDDP and Nutlin-3.

INTRODUCTION

Preclinical studies have become increasingly important
in this setting. They allow to determine new combination
strategies of these targeted agents with conventional
chemo- and/or radiotherapeutics, but also to unravel
the underlying molecular mechanisms and to define the
optimal treatment schemes.
A well-know mechanism driving tumor formation
is the disruption of the tumor suppressor protein p53.
The protein plays an important role in the response to a
variety of cellular stress signals by the induction of cell
cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis. The p53 pathway is
disturbed in most cancers either by inactivating mutations,
which occur in approximately 50% of all tumors, or by

In recent years, cancer therapy has evolved
from general treatment strategies to more specific
targeted therapies, based on the genetic profile of
individual tumors. Important progress has been made in
understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms that
drive tumorigenesis. These new findings have led to the
discovery of new therapeutic targets, and consequently the
development of new-targeted therapeutics. These tailormade treatment modalities might improve the efficiency of
cancer treatment, reduce common side effects by avoiding
unnecessary toxicity and improve general outcome.

other mechanisms, suppressing p53 levels in the cancer
cell. This makes the altered p53 pathway an attractive
target for novel cancer therapies [1-5].
An interesting strategy is to target the interaction
between p53 and its main negative regulator, the ‘murine
double minute-2’ (MDM2) protein. MDM2 is part of a
negative feedback loop in which p53 acts as a transcription
factor for MDM2, that in turn acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase
targeting p53 for proteasomal degradation. Overexpression
of MDM2 interrupts the well-controlled balance between
p53 and MDM2, leading to malignant transformation of
the cell. Increased MDM2 levels can result from MDM2
gene amplification, which is assumed to occur in 10%
of human tumors [6], or from the presence of a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP309) in the promoter
region of the MDM2 gene [7]. Inhibiting the interaction
between p53 and MDM2 might therefore restore the
normal p53 function. In 2004, Vassilev et al. identified
Nutlin-3, a small molecule inhibitor of the MDM2-p53
interaction with in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity
[8]. The molecule is able to induce the activation of p53
downstream targets, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [9].
Cancer cells with MDM2 gene amplification were most
sensitive to Nutlin-3 in vitro and in vivo, but Nutlin-3 also
showed good efficacy against tumors with normal MDM2
expression. This shows that a wide array of patients with
wild type p53 could benefit from the treatment with
antagonists of the p53-MDM2 interaction [4].
Although Nutlin-3 shows a good efficiency as a
single agent, the anti-tumoral effect might be enhanced
when it is administered in combination with DNAdamaging agents in p53 wild type tumors. In this study,
we focused on the combination of Nutlin-3 with CDDP
(cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II); cisplatin), a wellknown activator of the p53 pathway, in a series of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with different
p53 background (Figure 1). We selected the commonly
used A549 cell line based on its genotype (p53 wild
type, EGFR/ALK/ROS1 negative) and suitability as
transduction host, for which we used a vector containing
anti-p53 specific shRNA. In addition, CRL-5908 was used,
harboring the R273H p53 hotspot mutation, resulting in a
conformational change in the p53 protein and inhibiting its
transcriptional activity. Currently, CDDP treatment is used
in platinum doublet therapy for the treatment of late stage
EGFR/ALK/ROS1 negative tumors. However, tumor cells
lacking functional p53 are prone to be more resistant to
CDDP treatment [10]. Increasing functional p53 levels
by Nutlin-3 could enhance the cytotoxic effect of CDDP.
This combination regimen has been shown to be beneficial
in both sarcoma cell lines and CDDP resistant ovarian
cancer cell lines [9, 11]. On the other hand, Nutlin-3
is able to protect both normal and tumor wild type p53
cells from mitotic inhibitors like paclitaxel by inducing
G1 and G2 phase arrest [12-15]. Therefore, we studied
the effect of the treatment schedule for the combination
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of Nutlin-3 with CDDP by administrating these drugs
either simultaneously or sequentially (CDDP followed by
Nutlin-3). Prior treatment with Nutlin-3 would activate
p53 in a non-genotoxic way resulting in cell cycle arrest
rather than apoptosis; extending time for DNA repair
mechanisms to take place in response to CDDP induced
DNA damage before progression through critical phases
of the cell cycle [16, 17]. Therefore, prior treatment with
Nutlin-3 was not tested in this study. As regions with
reduced oxygen levels often characterize tumors, a part
of the study was performed under both normoxic and
hypoxic (<0.1% O2) conditions.

RESULTS
The role of wild type p53 in the response to
Nutlin-3 monotherapy
To determine the role of the p53 status in the
cytotoxic effect of Nutlin-3, cells with a different p53
background were treated with 0-50 μM Nutlin-3 for 24
hours. The p53 wild type cell line A549 and its nontemplate control A549-NTC were clearly more sensitive
to Nutlin-3 (IC50: 17.68 ± 4.52 μM and 19.42 ± 1.96 μM,
respectively), with an IC50 value significantly lower than
the isogenic p53 deficient cell line A549-920 (33.85 ±
4.84 μM; p-value: 0.002) and p53 mutant cell line CRL5908 (38.71 ± 2.43 μM; p-value < 0.001) (Figure 2A). To
obtain a better insight in the underlying mechanisms, all
cells were treated with 5 μM, 10 μM or 25 μM Nutlin-3
(corresponding with the IC20, IC40 and IC60 value in the
p53 wild type cell line A549) and p53 expression levels
were assessed. In contrast to the p53 deficient or mutant
cell lines, increasing p53 protein levels were observed
in accordance with increasing levels of Nutlin-3 in the
p53 wild type cell lines (Figure 2B). Lower levels of
p53 and p21 were observed for CRL-5908 treated with
10 μM Nutlin-3 due to a lower concentration of protein
loaded, corresponding with β-actin control levels. Nutlin-3
treatment led to the activation of wild type p53, resulting
in increased protein levels of its main transcription targets
PUMA, BAX, p21 and MDM2 (Figure 2B), which in turn
led to a significant increase in annexin V positive cells
(Figure 2C) in the p53 wild type cell lines, but not in the
p53 deficient and mutant cell lines. A significant G2/M
phase arrest was observed in A549 and A549-NTC at 25
μM Nutlin-3 treatment, but also in the p53 deficient cell
line A549-920, due to the presence of residual p53 and
p21 protein. The p53 mutant cell line did not show any
significant change in G2/M phase arrest (Figure 2D).

thereby inducing the activation of ATM/ATR. The latter are able to activate p53 by phosphorylation and the formation of a p53 tetramer,
which acts as a transcription factor for among others MDM2 (negative regulation), BAX and PUMA (apoptosis) and p21 (cell cycle arrest).
The inhibition of MDM2 by Nutlin-3 results in a high increase in p53 levels in response to CDDP treatment resulting in a synergistic
cytotoxic effect.

Nutlin-3 strongly synergizes with CDDP after
sequential combination therapy

(<CI> = 0.990 for CDDP + 5 μM Nutlin-3) was found
(Figure 3A).
The induction of a hypoxic environment led to a
noticeable decrease in CDDP IC50-value when sequentially
combined with 5 μM Nutlin-3, although not significant
(6.73 ± 0.30 vs. 4.69 ± 0.85 μM, p-value = 0.100). In
this hypoxic environment, sequential therapy induced a
synergistic effect, yet slightly weaker than the synergism
observed under normoxic conditions (<CI> = 0.625 vs.
<CI> = 0.486). As hypoxic conditions did not inhibit the
synergistic effect we conducted the following experiments
under normal oxygen levels.

Cell survival and synergism
To investigate the potential interaction between
Nutlin-3 and CDDP in the p53 wild type NSCLC cell line
A549, tumor cells were incubated with 0-20 μM CDDP
combined with either simultaneous or sequential treatment
of 0 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM or 25 μM Nutlin-3 for 24 hours. A
clear difference was observed between the two treatment
schemes, supported by the data in Table 1 and Figure
3. After sequential treatment, the strongest synergistic
effect was observed in the lowest concentrations ranges
of both Nutlin-3 and CDDP (<CI> = 0.486 for CDDP
-> 5 μM Nutlin-3) (Figure 3B), resulting in a significant
reduction in CDDP IC50-value (6.28 ± 1.62 vs. 2.52 ± 0.57
μM, p-value = 0.003). On the contrary, Nutlin-3 seemed
to protect cells from the cytotoxic effect of medium
to high concentrations of CDDP when administrated
simultaneously, resulting in an antagonistic effect at higher
concentrations of CDDP. However, a weak synergistic
effect at low concentrations of both Nutlin-3 and CDDP

Activation of wild type p53
The p53 protein levels strongly increased after
sequential combination therapy, even at a low dose of
Nutlin-3, compared to CDDP and Nutlin-3 monotherapy
(Figure 4A). After simultaneous treatment this effect was
only observed at higher concentrations of Nutlin-3.
Next, the activation status of p53 was determined
by determining the mRNA and protein levels of its main
transcription targets MDM2, PUMA, BAX, and p21
as well as their downstream effects, namely apoptosis
(PUMA and BAX) and cell cycle arrest (p21).

Negative regulation: induction of MDM2

mRNA levels. A similar effect was observed after
simultaneous and sequential combination therapy, for
which a significant effect was observed after treatment
with 10 and 25 μM Nutlin-3 in combination with 2 µM
CDDP (Figure 5A). This effect was translated to the
PUMA protein levels (Figure 5B). Despite these similar
effects after simultaneous and sequential therapy, a
significant increase in BAX mRNA levels was observed
only after sequential combination therapy, but not after
monotherapy or simultaneous combination therapy (Figure
5A). Again, this was also reflected at the BAX protein
levels (Figure 5B).
As both PUMA and BAX are able to induce p53
dependent apoptosis, the percentage of Annexin V
positive cells and PI positive cells was determined (Figure
5C). Sequential treatment led to a significant increase
in Annexin V positive cells even at low concentration

The mRNA levels of MDM2 were markedly
increased after sequential treatment, but not after
simultaneous treatment, compared to both CDDP and
Nutlin-3 monotherapy (Figure 4C) although a statistically
significant increase was only observed when CDDP was
combined sequentially with 25 μM Nutlin-3 (Figure 4C,
Figure 4D). At the MDM2 protein level, a noticeable
increase was seen earlier with a lower dose of Nutlin-3
(5 μM) for the sequential treatment compared to
simultaneous treatment. At higher doses of Nutlin-3, no
difference was seen between sequential and simultaneous
treatment (Figure 4B).
Induction of apoptosis
Treatment with Nutlin-3 led to a moderate (5 μM
and 10 μM) to significant (25 μM) increase in PUMA

the sequential combination therapy.

Duration of the cytotoxic effect

Cell cycle distribution
By monitoring the proliferation rate of A549 in realtime using the xCELLigence system, a better insight in
the duration and persistence of the cytotoxic effect after
sequential treatment has been acquired. Figure 7A shows
the growth curve after sequential treatment with CDDP
followed by Nutlin-3. All curves were normalized at the
end of treatment 1 (24h CDDP). Figure 7B shows the
corresponding cell survival at 1, 6, 12, 48, 72, 96 and
120 hours after the start of treatment 2 (24h Nutlin-3).
Treatment with 2 μM CDDP had only a minor effect
on overall cell survival over time. On the other hand,
treatment with 5 μM Nutlin-3 showed an increase of the
cell index in the first 48 hours after the start of treatment,
after which the number of cells gradually decreased.
Sequential combination therapy showed a substantial
decrease in the number of cells compared to the vehicle
treated sample starting within 6 hours after treatment
with Nutlin-3. After 96 hours, this decrease stagnated.
These results indicate that the cytotoxic effect is clearly
dependent on the addition of Nutlin-3, and is persistent
over time, up to 96 hours after wash out of the drugs.

P21 is an important transcription target of p53, able
to induce cell cycle arrest. The mRNA levels of p21 were
determined after both mono- and combination therapy. A
strong and significant increase in p21 mRNA levels was
observed after monotherapy with 25 μM Nutlin-3, and
after sequential treatment with 5, 10 and 25 μM Nutlin-3
(Figure 6A). Again, a significant effect was not present
after simultaneous treatment (Figure 6A). Similarly, the
highest levels of the p21 protein were observed after
sequential combination therapy (Figure 6B).
Since therapy seemed to induce a strong
activation of the downstream target p21, the cell cycle
distribution after both mono- and combination therapy
was investigated, resulting in a very strong significant
G2/M phase arrest after sequential therapy, even at
low concentrations of Nutlin-3 and a markedly but not
significant increase after monotherapy and simultaneous
combination therapy (Figure 6C). Again, the sequential
combination therapy was clearly more favorable over
monotherapy or simultaneous combination therapy.
Therefore, for the following experiments we focused on

The role of wild type p53

any significant changes in cell cycle distribution (Figure
8D). Finally, the induction of apoptosis was similarly
dependent on the p53 status of the cell. A significant
increase in apoptotic cells was only observed in the p53
wild type cell lines, but not in the p53 mutant and deficient
cell line. Nevertheless, the A549-920 cell line did show an
identifiable increase in apoptotic cells (Figure 8C).

To determine the role of wild type p53 in the
observed cytotoxic effect of the synergistic combination
therapy (2 μM CDDP treatment followed by 5 μM
Nutlin-3), a similar experimental setup was used for the
A549 non-template control (A549-NTC), p53 deficient
(A549-920) and p53 mutant cell line (CRL-5908). All cell
lines were compared to the wild type p53 cell line A549.
There was no significant difference between the
CDDP IC50-values in A549 and A549-NTC cells (IC50:
5.51 ± 0.72 vs. 4.63 ± 0.39, p-value = 0.066), while the
p53 deficient cell line A549-920 was significantly less
sensitive to CDDP (IC50: 8.72 ± 0.86, p-value = 0.000) as
for the p53 mutant cell line CRL-5908 (IC50: 9.60 ± 0.63,
p-value = 0.000) compared to A549 (table 2). A strong
to moderate synergistic effect was only observed in the
p53 wild type cell line A549 and A549-NTC (CI = 0.486
± 0.138; CI = 0.785 ± 0.370, respectively), which was
strongest at low concentrations of CDDP. A549-920 was
characterized by an overall antagonistic effect, but slightly
synergistic at certain CDDP concentrations (CI = 1.906
± 2.147). For CRL-5908 cells, no synergistic effect was
observed at any CDDP concentration (CI = 1.453 ± 0.447).
A more detailed overview of these results is given in Table
2 and Figure 8A.
Next, the p53 protein levels were studied. The
strongest increase was observed after combination therapy
in the p53 wild type cell lines. The transduced A549920 cell line expressed some residual levels of p53 after
CDDP and combination therapy, but markedly lower than
the parental cell line A549 and its negative control A549NTC. CRL-5908 showed high levels of mutant p53, which
were strongest after CDDP treatment and independent of
Nutlin-3 treatment (Figure 8B).
Corresponding with the p53 levels, the protein levels
of p53’s main transcription targets (MDM2, PUMA, BAX
and p21) increased in the p53 wild type cell lines, with
the most noticeable increase after combination therapy.
None of these targets were observed in the p53 mutant
cell line CRL-5908. As mentioned before, A549-920
cells expressed some residual p53 protein, resulting in
an increased expression of MDM2 and p21 after CDDP
treatment or combination therapy, but not after Nutlin-3
monotherapy. This effect in A549-920 was much less
pronounced for the apoptotic related proteins PUMA, for
which no increase was observed after combination therapy,
and BAX, whose levels slightly increased after CDDP
and combination therapy (Figure 8B). In the same way,
combination therapy influenced the cell cycle distribution
dependent on the p53 status of the cell. The wild type p53
cell lines A549 and A549-NTC, but also the p53 deficient
cell lines A549-920 responded by a significant G2/M
phase arrest. However, the arrest induced in A549-920 was
significantly less than this induced in the parental cell line
A549 (p = 0.015). The p53 mutant cell line did not show

DISCUSSION
CDDP is the first line treatment for a selected
NSCLC patient population administrated as platinum
doublet therapy. The induction of CDDP dependent DNA
damage triggers the DNA damage response activated by
the ATR-Chk2 pathway resulting in p53 activation and
apoptosis [18]. Tumor cells lacking functional p53 were
more resistant to CDDP therapy, which was reversed upon
reconstitution with wild type p53 [10]. In addition, TP53
mutations seem to negatively influence the response to
CDDP therapy as a significant better overall survival and
response rate was observed in TP53 wild type patients
compared to TP53 mutant patients [19-21]. As the p53
pathway clearly plays an important role in the response
to CDDP, the presence of adequate levels of functional
wild type p53 is a necessity. By targeting the MDM2-p53
interaction in wild type p53 tumors, the p53 levels can be
increased and the cytotoxic response to CDDP might be
improved.
In this study, we hypothesized that the combination
of CDDP with the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 could result
in a synergistic cytotoxic response in p53 wild type cell
lines. We focused on the sequence of administration, since
Nutlin-3 is able to induce cell cycle arrest, which possibly
could protect the cells from CDDP damage. Consistent
with previous studies, our study showed that the response
to Nutlin-3, in particular the induction of apoptotic cell
death and cell cycle arrest, is p53 dependent, as only a
minor cytotoxic effect was observed in the p53 deficient
and mutant cell lines at high concentrations of Nutlin-3 [9,
22, 23]. Although the p53 wild type cells were sensitive
to Nutlin-3 monotherapy, the apoptotic response and
induction of cell cycle arrest were limited, possibly due
to the lack of an activation signal of the p53 pathway,
for example the induction of DNA damage by CDDP
treatment.
This hypothesis was confirmed in our results
indicating that the cytotoxic effect of CDDP was
synergistically increased when combined with Nutlin-3.
Our results are similar to those of previous studies in
CDDP sensitive and resistant ovarian cancer cell lines
or sarcoma cell lines, in which a low dose of CDDP
was combined simultaneously with Nutlin-3 [9, 11].
We are the first to show that the sequential treatment of
CDDP followed by Nutlin-3 resulted in the most potent
synergistic effect compared to simultaneous treatment,
both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, in NSCLC.

This effect was reflected at both the p53 protein level as
well as its activity. Treatment resulted in a significant
increase in p53’s transcriptional targets at both mRNA
and protein level and the resulting induction of G2/M
cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death. In this study
we looked at the expression levels of the pro-apoptotic
proteins PUMA and BAX. PUMA localizes to the
mitochondria and inhibits the anti-apoptotic proteins
Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, resulting in BAX activation. BAX
is a transcriptional target of p53 and is able to induce
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, resulting
in the release of cytochrome c and induction of apoptotic
caspase pathway [24]. For PUMA mRNA levels, similar
results were observed after simultaneous versus sequential
treatment although protein levels differed. On the contrary
BAX mRNA levels were only significantly increased after
sequential therapy, which resulted in a strong difference
in BAX protein levels, compared to simultaneous therapy.

The capability of sequential treatment to induce a stronger
BAX upregulation might explain the difference seen in the
apoptotic response between simultaneous and sequential
combination therapy.
In addition, drug dose largely affected synergism.
Although combination treatment with higher doses of
Nutlin-3 resulted in an increased transcription of p53
target genes and consequently increased protein levels,
this did not result in a stronger synergistic effect. Adequate
levels of p53 protein and its target proteins to induce their
effect on cell cycle distribution or apoptosis seem to be
reached at the combination of low doses. This effect was
not improved by augmenting the dose of Nutlin-3 as seen
in Figures 5 and 6. This could explain why the synergistic
effect was strongest at low doses of CDDP and Nutlin-3.
The reduction of this response in the p53 deficient
cell line, that still expressed low levels of p53, and the
absence of a response in the mutant cell line indicates

that this effect is strongly p53 dependent, implicating that
only patients harboring wild type p53 would benefit from
this combination. However, newly developed molecules
like APR-246 (reactivation of mutant p53) could be able
to overcome this limitation [25]. The observation that
the combination therapy led to a significant G2/M phase
arrest, but not to a significant increase in apoptotic cells
in the transduced cell line is consistent with the view that
low levels of p53 induce cell cycle arrest, whereas higher
levels are needed to induce apoptosis [17]. Hence, the
high levels of wild type p53 expressed after the sequential
combination therapy in the parental cell line are at least
partly responsible for the significant increase in apoptotic
cell death compared to monotherapy.
Previous studies have also shown a p53 independent
effect, likely through the inhibition of the p73-MDM2
binding or by activating E2F1 [9, 26, 27]. However, p53
independent effects only occurred at higher concentrations
of Nutlin-3, which could greatly increase side effects.
We did not observe a synergistic effect when combining
CDDP with high concentrations of Nutlin-3 in p53
deficient/mutant cell lines (data not shown).
An important feature of newly developed
therapeutics is the effect on non-malignant cells, and
in general unwanted side effects in patients, especially
when these new drugs are combined with commonly used
chemotherapeutics [15]. Several studies have shown a
cytoprotective effect of Nutlin-3 in normal cells, not only
by inducing cell cycle arrest but also by blocking BAX and
BAK activation in mitochondria and thereby preventing
apoptotic cell death [12, 15]. We observed a similar
antagonistic effect in cancer cells when administrating
higher concentrations of CDDP simultaneously with
Nutlin-3, but not after sequential therapy, stressing the
importance to determine if the sequential combination
therapy is well tolerated by normal cells in vivo.
Currently, several Nutlin-3 analogues like RG7112
or RG7388 are in clinical trials as monotherapy or in
combination therapy [17, 28-30]. These compounds are
mostly tested in sarcoma patients, eg. well-differentiated
and dedifferentiated liposarcomas, because MDM2 gene
amplification occurs in about 20% of all cases, making
them adequate study subjects [6, 28, 31]. However, our
results show that other types of cancer, like NSCLC, could
also benefit from MDM2-inhibitor combination strategies
independent of the MDM2 expression status, by enhancing
the expression and activation of wild type p53 in response
to CDDP treatment.
Our results point to an optimal combination therapy,
being the induction of DNA damage by CDDP, followed
by an increase in p53 levels by Nutlin-3. A lower dose of
CDDP could be used, potentially reducing side effects for
NSCLC patients and improving overall prognosis. This
effect was strongly dependent on the presence of wild
type p53. It would be interesting to extend this research
in vivo, comparing Nutlin-3 with newly developed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MDM2 inhibitors currently in clinical development, in
combination with CDDP and possibly initiate a clinical
trial. The focus should be on the ideal time point for
the sequential administrating of both drugs in NSCLC
patients, the administrated dose and the tumors p53 status.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
The NSCLC adenocarcinoma cell lines used in
this study were the parental p53 wild type A549 cell
line (p53 WT, ECACC, Salisbury, England), and its
isogenic derivatives A549-NTC (non-template control,
p53 wild type) and A549-920 (p53 shRNA, lentiviral
vector) obtained after transduction using the GIPZ
lentiviral shRNA VGH5526-EG7157 viral particle set
(Thermoscientific, Waltham, USA). In order to obtain
a stably transduced cell line, cells were maintained in
medium containing 5 μg/ml puromycin. CRL-5908
(ATCC, Rockville, USA) was used as p53 mutant cell line
(R273H). Cells were cultured according to the distributor’s
instructions.
Cells were grown as monolayers and cultures
were maintained in exponential growth in 5% C02/95%
air in a humidified incubator at 37°C to obtain normoxic
conditions and in a humidifier Bactron IV anaerobic
chamber (Shel Lab, 0% O2, 5% CO2, 95% N2) to obtain
hypoxic conditions (<0.1% O2). Hypoxic conditions were
initiated after first treatment. All cell lines were free from
mycoplasma contamination.

Monotherapy
Cells were plated in 96 well plates at concentrations
of approximately 1800 cells/well for A549, A549-NTC,
A549-920 and 2500 cells/well for CRL-5908. Cells were
incubated overnight and treated for 24 hours with CDDP
(0-20 µM) or Nutlin (0-50 µM) as single agents. Fortyeight hours after treatment, cell survival was determined
using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as previously
described [32].

Combination therapy and criteria for synergism
The combination therapies were performed in 96
well plates as described above. A549 cells were treated
with CDDP (0-20 µM), combined with Nutlin-3 (5, 10, 25
µM), either simultaneous or sequential (CDDP followed
by Nutlin). A549-NTC, A549-920 and CRL-5908 cells
were only treated with the most optimal combination
therapy. Cell survival was determined by the SRB assay.
To determine the presence of a possible synergistic

effect the combination index (CI) was calculated by the
Chou-Talalay Method using the CalcuSyn software. A
combination index CI < 1 indicates synergism, CI = 1 an
additive effect and CI > 1 an antagonistic effect [33].

Cambridge, UK, no. ab109199), rabbit monoclonal
anti-PUMA (1:2000, Abcam no. ab33906) and rabbit
monoclonal anti-BAX (1:2000, Abcam no. ab32503).
Mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin was used as internal
standard (1:5000, Sigma Aldrich, Diegem, Belgium). Antimouse and anti-rabbit HRP-labeled secondary antibodies
were used (1:2000, Cell Signaling no. 7076S and no.
7074S) and chemiluminescent detection was performed
using the WesternBrightTM Quantum Western blotting
detection kit (Advansta, Temse, Belgium).

XCELLigence real-time cell analysis (RTCA)
Real-time monitoring of cell viability was performed
on an xCELLigence RTCA DP instrument (ACEA
Biosciences, San Diego, USA). A detailed description of
this method can be found in previously published work
from our group [34]. Cells were plated in a 16-well E-plate
and treated with 2 μM CDDP, and previously described
Nutlin-3 concentrations. Cell viability was monitored
for a period of approximately 144 hours, with kinetic
measurements programmed every 15 minutes.

Flow cytometry
Cells were plated in a 6-well plate as described
above. Samples were analyzed using a FACScan flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Each sample was analyzed
using 10.000 events/sample acquired. Data was analyzed
using FlowJo V10. Induction of apoptotic cell death
in the wild type A549 cell lines was investigated using
the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Becton
Dickinson Pharmingen, Erembodegem, Belgium)
according to the manufacturers instructions. Green
(Annexin V-FITC) and red (PI) fluorescence was analyzed
using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
Data was presented as dot plots (Annexin V plotted
against PI staining). Apoptosis was determined as Annexin
V positive cells, i.e. UR + LR. The number of apoptotic
cells in the transduced cell lines A549-NTC and A549920 were determined using Annexin V-PerCP-CyTM5.5
(BD pharmingen) due to the interference of FITC with the
transduction control protein TurboGFP. Annexin V-PerCPCyTM5.5 was also used with A549 and CRL-5908 in order
to compare the results.
Cell cycle distribution was monitored according to
the Vindelov method, as describe previously [36]. Data
was presented as histograms of DNA content to determine
cell cycle distribution (G0/G1, S and G2/M).

RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR
A549 cells were plated in a 6-well plate at
concentrations of 6.5 x 104 cells/well. Total RNA was
extracted using the TRIzol® method (Life Technologies,
Ghent, Belgium) after lysis. Total RNA-yield and quality
were measured using the NanoDrop® ND-1000 (Thermo
Scientific, Erembodegem, Belgium) and stored at -80°C.
RT-PCR was performed using the Power SYBR
Green RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems, Ghent,
Belgium) on the LightCycler480 (Roche, Vilvoorde,
Belgium) according to the manufacturers instructions with
a total of 30 ng RNA. The optimal number and type of
housekeeping genes (GAPD, RPLA13, and SDHA-1) were
determined using the qbasePLUS software (Biogazelle,
Zwijnaarde, Belgium). Relative gene expression levels
were calculated according to the comparative Ct method
using the same software and plotted against the untreated
sample. A panel of targets was selected based on
interesting transcription targets of p53, namely PUMA and
BAX (apoptosis), p21 (cell cycle arrest), MDM2 (negative
feedback loop). Primers are available on request.

Statistical analysis

Western blot

All experiments were performed at least three times.
Results, if not otherwise stated, are presented as mean ±
standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance in table
one and two was determined using the Mann-Whitney
U test between each group and the untreated control.
Statistical significance for apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and
mRNA levels was determined by a two-way ANOVA test,
followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test for the comparison
with the untreated sample or CDDP treated sample, using
SPSS 22.

Cells were plated in a 6-well plate as described
above. Cells were lysed on plates in TNN buffer. After
centrifugation (5 minutes, 800rpm) the supernatants
containing the isolated proteins was kept at -80°C. Protein
concentrations were determined using the Pierce® BCA
protein assay kit (ThermoScientific). Western blot analysis
was performed as described previously [35].
Following antibodies were used: rabbit monoclonal
anti-p53 (1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology, Leiden, the
Netherlands, no. 9282); mouse monoclonal anti-MDM2
(3G9) (1:1000, Millipore, Overijse, Belgium, no. 041555), rabbit monoclonal anti-p21 (1:2000, Abcam,
