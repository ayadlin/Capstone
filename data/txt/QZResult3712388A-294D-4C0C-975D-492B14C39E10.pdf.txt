ABSTRACT
While metastasis, the main cause of lung cancer-related death, has been
extensively studied, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. A previous
clinicogenomic study revealed that expression of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase
(GalNAc-T14), is highly inversely correlated with recurrence-free survival in those
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the underlying molecular
mechanism(s) has not been determined. Here, we showed that GalNAc-T14 expression
was positively associated with the invasive phenotype. Microarray and biochemical
analyses revealed that HOXB9, the expression of which was increased in a GalNAcT14-dependent manner, played an important role in metastasis. GalNAc-T14 increased
the sensitivity of the WNT response and increased the stability of the β-catenin
protein, leading to induced expression of HOXB9 and acquisition of an invasive
phenotype. Pharmacological inhibition of β-catenin in GalNAc-T14-expressing cancer
cells suppressed HOXB9 expression and invasion. A meta-analysis of clinical genomics
data revealed that expression of GalNAc-T14 or HOXB9 was strongly correlated with
reduced recurrence-free survival and increased hazard risk, suggesting that targeting
β-catenin within the GalNAc-T14/WNT/HOXB9 axis may be a novel therapeutic
approach to inhibit metastasis in NSCLC.

unknown, and therefore, putative molecular targets remain
to be identified.
Wnt signaling, one of the most well-characterized
signaling pathways in cancer metastasis [3], is activated
by Wnt ligand binding to the Frizzled receptor, which
stabilizes β-catenin. β-catenin, in turn, associates with
the T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancing factor
(LEF) transcription factors to induce the expression of
a number of genes involved in cancer cell proliferation,

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is not only the most commonly
diagnosed cancer but also the leading cause of cancerassociated death, due to its poor prognosis and active
metastasis to other organs after diagnosis [1]. Suppression
of metastasis are therefore being investigated as future
therapeutic strategies [2]. However, the molecular
mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis are largely

survival [4], and metastasis [5]. For example, HOXB9,
a class 1 homeobox gene associated with tumorigenesis,
metastasis, and poor prognosis [6, 7], is upregulated by
Wnt signaling and promotes lung cancer metastasis [8].
Therefore, targeting β-catenin to inhibit cancer growth
and metastasis has been extensively studied, and several
small molecule inhibitors of β-catenin are in clinical trials
[9, 10].
The N-acetyl-galactosaminyl-transferases (GalNAcTs or GalNTs) are responsible for synthesizing the
Thomsen-nouvelle antigen (Tn), one of cancer-associated
O-glycans [11, 12], whose expression is positively
associated with many types of cancer and correlates with
metastasis and even poor survival [13–16]. Thus, GalNAcTs such as GalNAc-T2 [17–19], T13 [20], and T14 [21]
were shown to induce metastatic potential. Of interest,
GalNAc-T isoenzymes produce unique O-glycoproteomes
of signaling molecules such as a death receptor [22, 23],
implying that GalNAc-Ts expression in cancer cells may
affect the cellular response to external stimuli such as
growth factors, cytokines to determine cancer-associated
phenotypes.
Previously, we reported that expression of
GalNAc-T14 (or GALNT14) was highly associated
with poor recurrence-free survival in a clinicogenomics
study with 138 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients [24]. However, the molecular mechanism for
the significant difference in poor recurrence-free survival
remained undetermined. Here, we show that GalNAc-T14
increases β-catenin protein stability and the subsequent
Wnt target gene response, particularly the induction
of HOXB9, the expression of which is critical for the
invasive properties of lung adenocarcinoma. In addition,
pharmacological inhibition of β-catenin significantly
suppressed invasive features, suggesting that treatment
of GalNAc-T14-expressing lung cancers with a β-catenin
inhibitor would be a valid therapeutic approach to reduce
their metastatic potential.

cells (shGal#1 and shGal#3; shGal-H460) (Fig. 1B). As
expression of GalNAc-T14 is most significantly high in
patients with lung cancer recurrence [24], we hypothesized
that GalNAc-T14 expression may promote lung cancer
metastasis. As predicted, the migration capacity of both
the shGal#1 and shGal#3-H460 cell lines, determined
by measuring the recovery area in a scratch assay, was
markedly decreased compared to the control (Fig. 1C),
while the cell proliferation rate remained unaltered in the
shGal-H460 lines (Fig. S1B). In addition, cell migration
of confluent cells grown on a coverslip toward the empty
area of the cell plate was also significantly weakened in
the shGal#3 cell line (Fig. 1D). As not only the movement
on 2D surface but also the infiltration through 3D matrix
is critical capacity of tumor cells to promote metastasis,
the invasive characteristics of the cell lines were compared
in a two-chamber invasion assay. As shown in Fig. 1E,
lack of GalNAc-T14 also reduced the invasive properties
of H460 cells. Taken together, these data imply that
GalNAc-T14 expression increases the metastatic potential
of lung cancer cells.

GalNAc-T14 controls Wnt responsiveness
Next, to examine the molecular mechanism
through which GalNAc-T14 controls metastatic potential,
a microarray analysis was performed to compare gene
expression in the two shGal-H460 cell lines compared
to the parental control cells (Fig. S2A). The commonly
altered gene set in the two shGal-H460 cell lines was
analyzed by both gene ontology and gene card analysis.
Of interest, 29.1% of altered genes in both shGal#1 and #3
are related to metastasis (i.e., invasion and migration),
supporting the results in Fig. 1 that GalNAc-T14
expression is linked to metastatic potential (Fig. S2).
To identify a signaling pathway governing GalNAcT14-dependent metastatic potential from among a number
of signaling pathways underlying metastasis [25, 26], the
altered gene expression profile was carefully reanalyzed.
Of note, the two main sets of genes altered by the lack
of GalNAc-T14 are those involved in metastasis (29.1%)
and stemness (20.6%) (Fig. S2B). Therefore, we focused
on the NF-kB [27], Notch [28], and Wnt [29] signaling
pathways, which are implicated in cancer stemness as well
as metastasis. Through analysis of the altered gene set in
the microarray data (Fig. 2A) and following assessment
of reporter activity (Fig. 2B and S3A/SB), we concluded
that Wnt activity was most significantly reduced by
GalNAc-T14 knock-down. As shown in Fig. 2B, Wnt
reporter activity in both shGal#1 and shGal#3 was
markedly reduced upon Wnt3a supplementation [Wnt3a
conditioned medium (Wnt3a CM)] compared to controls.
Similarly, dose-dependent Wnt reporter activity in the
absence of GalNAc-T14 was also notably decreased
compared to the control (Fig. 2C). It is noteworthy that

RESULTS
Loss of GalNAc-T14 results in retarded
migration and invasiveness
To investigate the role of GalNAc-T14 in lung cancer
metastasis, the GalNAc-T14 expression levels in NSCLC
cell lines was first compared. As shown previously [23],
H460 expressed a higher level of GalNAc-T14 compared
to H1975 (Fig. 1A). Thus, GalNAc-T14 knockdown cells
were generated by the stable expression of GalNAc-T14
shRNA (shGalNAc-T14; shGal) in H460 cells. Among
the five shRNAs for GalNAc-T14, two independent
shRNAs (#1 and 3) suppressed GalNAc-T14 efficiently
(Fig. S1A), and stable expression of each shRNA
produced two clones of GalNAc-T14 knockdown H460

Wnt responsiveness, shown in Fig. 2C, appeared to be
adversely correlated with the level of GalNAc-T14 shown
in Fig. 1B (i.e., higher knockdown efficiency in shGal#3
than in shGal#1), suggesting that GalNAc-T14 expression
may be important for increased Wnt responsiveness.
As Wnt responsiveness results from accumulation of

Moreover, HOXB9 was also found to be the most
significantly increased gene in a microarray database
of PC9-BrM3 cells (GSE14107), which are derived
from the PC9 lung adenocarcinoma cell line and form
brain metastases with close to 100% efficiency (Figs 3C
and S4B). Of note, GalNAc-T14 expression was also
highly expressed in the same database (Fig. S4B). In a
previous study, a total of 138 NSCLC tumor samples were
analyzed by microarray, and GalNAc-T14 was the most
significant gene out of 20 genes that were highly expressed
in lung cancer patients with a high risk of recurrence
[24]. Thus, an appealing hypothesis is that HOXB9
expression may be caused by increased Wnt activity due
to high GalNAc-T14 expression in lung cancer, and is
responsible for the increased metastatic potential. To test
this hypothesis, the dependency of HOXB9 expression
on GalNAc-T14 was first confirmed by siRNA, to rule
out any possible non-specific response in shGal-H460
cells. As shown in Fig. 3E, knockdown of GalNAc-T14
by siRNA significantly lowered HOXB9 expression in
control H460 cells but not in shGal#3 cells. Considering
the positive correlation between GalNAc-T14 and HOXB9
in a cell model (Figs 3E and S4B), the potential positive
correlation between GalNAc-T14 and HOXB9 expression
was examined in other lung cancer cell models and in
cancer tissue. To this end, we took advantage of multiple
open access databases (http://www.nextbio.com and
http://cancergenome.nih.gov) for cancer cell line and
cancer tissue analysis, respectively. Intriguingly, a close
positive correlation between HOXB9 and GalNAc-T14
was observed both in 31 NSCLC cell lines (top panel)
and in 23 lung adenocarcinoma patients (bottom panel)
(Fig. 3F), implying that GalNAc-T14 expression is closely
associated with HOXB9 expression in lung cancer. More
importantly, GalNAc-T14 was evidently responsible for
Wnt responsiveness, resulting in HOXB9 induction upon
Wnt supplementation (Fig. 3G).

shGal-H460 cells was markedly lower than that of control
(Fig. 2D and S3C). Of note, GalNAc-T14 was dominantly
located in Golgi complex stained with GM130 unlike
ABC in the plasma membrane (Fig. S3D). In support of
this result, unphosphorylated β-catenin, recruited to the
plasma membrane upon Wnt3a treatment, contributing to
Wnt downstream gene response [31], was clearly reduced
by GalNAc-T14 knockdown (Fig. 2E, white arrows). As
the APC destruction complex recognizes phosphorylated
β-catenin for degradation, the protein stability of β-catenin
in shGal#3 cells was significantly reduced, whereas cyclin
D1 protein stability appeared to be equivalent regardless
of GalNAc-T14 expression (Fig. 2F). These data
suggest that weakened Wnt responsiveness induced by
GalNAc-T14 knockdown would result in lower expression
of a metastasis mediator(s) in our model system.

HOXB9 expression is regulated by GalNAc-T14
through the Wnt pathway
To identify a putative metastasis mediator, we
searched for commonly altered genes in shGal-H460 cells
that are not only downstream of the Wnt/TCF pathway
but are also associated with metastasis. Among 62
genes, those whose expression was significantly altered
in both shGal#1 and #3 cells (cutoff range: greater than
1.8 and less than 0.55), and that are downstream of
Wnt and involved in metastasis (including invasion and
migration), as defined by either gene ontology, gene
card analysis, or literature search, were further selected.
Only four genes, follistatin (FST), versican (VCAN),
amphiregulin (AREG), and homeobox B9 (HOXB9), were
found to satisfy these criteria (Figs 3A and S4A). The
decreased levels of these four genes in shGal#3 cells were
further validated by real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 3B).
Amphiregulin (AREG), a well-characterized prognostic
and metastatic biomarker of various types of cancers
[32, 33], has been extensively studied in malignancy and
metastasis [34], validating our approach to identify genes
putatively involved in metastasis. To further determine a
key target governing GalNAc-T14-dependent metastatic
potential, multiple lung cancer clinicogenomics databases
for patient overall survival (GSE36471) (Fig. 3C) and
cancer stage and recurrence (GSE31210 and GSE8894)
(Fig. 3D) were examined. As shown in Fig. 3C, of the
four gene candidates, high HOXB9 expression was found
to be the most significantly correlated with reduced
patient survival in lung adenocarcinoma, according
to at least one publically available clinicogenomics
database (GSE36471, http://www.bioprofiling.de/GEO/
DRUGSUR V/index. html) [35]. Interestingly, in two
independent clinicogenomics studies (GSE31210 and
GSE8894), HOXB9 expression was most significantly
altered in patients with high-grade tumors (GSE31210)
and in recurrent lung cancer (GSE8894), respectively.

HOXB9 expression is responsible for the invasive
properties conferred by GalNAc-T14
As HOXB9 was the most promising Wnt
downstream target to account for the induction of
metastatic potential by GalNAc-T14, HOXB9 knockdown
cells were next generated (Fig. S5A), and migration
capability with or without GalNAc-T14 expression was
monitored. Cell migration (Fig. 4A) but not proliferation
capability (Fig.  S5B) was significantly suppressed by
HOXB9 knockdown in control H460 cells but not in
shGal#3 cells, where HOXB9 expression was already
reduced (Fig. 3B). Similar results were achieved
with independent knockdown of HOXB9 with siRNA
(Fig. S5C). In addition, cell mobility from the confluent
cell front to the empty area was noticeably decreased by
downregulation of HOXB9, and was completely inhibited

by dual knockdown of HOXB9 and GalNAc-T14 (Fig. 4B).
Not only migration capacity but also invasive property
was significantly impaired by HOXB9 knockdown (Fig.
S5D). To finally confirm the effect of GalNAc-T14 and
HOXB9 expression in metastasis in vivo, established cell
lines, which were further labeled with EGFP for tracking
purposes, were injected i.v. into mice. Whereas tumor
formation was observed at the dorsal area and forelimbs of
the control group (two out of three mice), none of the mice
that received either the shGal#3 or the shHOXB9 cell line
developed tumors (Fig. 4C). All tumor tissues, isolated
from the shCont group showed clear green fluorescence
(Fig. 4D, top panel). In special, tumor isolated from the
forelimbs showed clear bone metastasis (Fig. 4D, bottom
panel). Collectively, these results indicate that HOXB9
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and GalNAc-T14 expression are strongly correlated with
metastatic tumor formation.

Targeting β-catenin for suppressing metastasis
through repression of HOXB9
HOXB9, a putative downstream target of Wnt/TCF
signaling that was dependent on GalNAc-T14 expression,
contributed to metastatic tumor formation (Figs 3 and 4).
These results indicated that using a pharmacological
inhibitor to target β-catenin, whose protein stability was
clearly increased by GalNAc-T14, would be a valid
approach to inhibit HOXB9-dependent metastasis. To this
end, ICG-001, a pharmacological inhibitor of β-catenin,
an analog which is currently in clinical trials [9],

was used in the lung cancer cell model. Suppression of
Wnt reporter activity under Wnt supplementation was
evident in the controls, but not in shGal#3 cells (Fig. 5A).
Consequently, HOXB9 expression was also suppressed in
an ICG-001 dose-dependent manner in the control cells,
but HOXB9 remained low in shGal#3 cells (Fig. 5B). The
migration rate, as determined by wound healing array,
was significantly repressed by ICG-001 treatment
(Fig.  5C). Similarly, cell migration from confluent
cells grown on a coverslip was remarkably reduced by
ICG-001 treatment of control cells and reduced to a lesser
degree in shGal#3 cells (Fig. 5D). These data strongly
suggest that targeting β-catenin in lung cancer with high
expression of GalNAc-T14, which sensitizes lung cancer
cells to Wnt, leading to HOXB9 expression, would be a
valid approach to suppress HOXB9-dependent metastatic
potential.

A few small molecules are currently in clinical trials [9].
For successful targeted therapy of lung cancer with a
Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor, a particular lung tumor, which
is influenced by Wnt/β-catenin needs to be identified.
However, due to the lack of a clear marker for aberrance
[e.g., a high β-catenin expression level is paradoxically
associated with improved clinical outcome [39, 40]], as
well as the diversity of main effectors in Wnt/β-catenin
signaling, it will be critical to properly diagnose Wnt/βcatenin dependency for optimal therapeutic selection, as
suggested previously [38, 41]
Herein, we demonstrated that GalNAc-T14, the
expression of which has been previously correlated with
lung cancer recurrence, promoted metastatic potential
through Wnt/β-catenin-dependent HOXB9 expression.
Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of β-catenin, in
order to block transcriptional factor complex formation,
significantly attenuated the metastatic properties of
GalNAc-T14-expressing cells (Fig. 5). Given that
GalNAc-T14 expression in lung cancer is readily
detectable by immunohistochemistry (IHC) [42], GalNAcT14-positive cells (i.e., the possible metastatic population)
would be a valid target for anti-Wnt/β-catenin therapy in
order to suppress possible metastasis.
Previously, GalNAc-T14 was shown to promote
apoptosis induced by a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) by increasing
GalNAc modification of the death receptor (DR), which
leads to an increase in death complex formation [23].
As the addition of an N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)
moiety onto a signaling molecule such as DR4 by the
enzymatic activity of GalNAc-T14 is responsible for
altering cellular signaling toward apoptosis [23], it
will be important to identify the molecular target of
GalNAc, which results in increased Wnt/β-catenin
activity and may account for its ability to increase
metastatic potential. We also examined the GalNAc
status of a number of positive mediators of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling. Given that increased GalNAc-T14-dependent
Wnt responsiveness was apparent under conditions
of Wnt3a supplementation (Figs 2B and 2C), we are
currently investigating the possibility that GalNAc status
of Wnt receptor/co-receptor by GalNAc-T14 may be
responsible for altered Wnt responsiveness, using lectin
co-immunoprecipitation experiment, which was used for
detecting the alteration of O-glycans of epithelial growth
factor receptor by GalNAc-T2 [17] (data not shown).
Currently, the identification of a putative GalNAc-T14
target molecule(s) that links GalNAc-T14 to the Wnt/βcatenin/HOXB9 axis is under investigation.
We also assessed the prognostic significance
of GalNAc-T14 and HOXB9 in patients with lung
adenocarcinoma. In a large data set (461 cases for the
TCGA), GalNAc-T14 and HOXB9 expression was
apparently associated with an increased risk of poor overall
survival and high recurrence in lung adenocarcinoma

Prognostic significance of the expression of
GalNAc-T14 and HOXB9 in lung cancer
To investigate the prognostic significance of
GalNAc-T14 and HOXB9, a survival analysis was
performed with large clinical data sets, The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). TCGA data was generated
with about 500 lung adenocarcinoma samples using
RNA-Seq. In the data set, a considerable number of the
cancer samples showed highly increased expression of
GalNAc-T14 or HOXB9 compared to the normal samples,
but there were no differences between normal and tumor
samples in the expression of the other three candidate
genes, FST, VCAN, and AREG (Fig. S6). For survival
analysis, the samples were divided into two groups, low
and high, according to the expression of GalNAc-T14
and HOXB9 in normal samples (Figs 6A and 6B). By
Kaplan–Meier analysis, the group expressing high levels
of GalNAc-T14 (Fig. 6A) or HOXB9 (Fig. 6B) showed
significantly worse outcomes for both overall and relapsefree survival than the low-expressing groups. Moreover,
multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the
expression level of GalNAc-T14 and HOXB9 retained
their significance as independent prognostic factors for
both overall survival (GalNAc-T14: hazard ratio = 1.731,
p = 0.003; HOXB9: hazard ratio = 1.532, p = 0.016) and
recurrence (GalNAc-T14: hazard ratio = 1.487, p = 0.033;
HOXB9: hazard ratio = 1.381, p = 0.089) (Table A and
B for GalNAc-T14 and C and D for HOXB9). Taken
together, expression level of GalNAc-T14 and HOXB9 are
each associated with the risk of poor overall survival and
high recurrence in lung adenocarcinoma patients.

DISCUSSION
Pharmacological approaches targeting Wnt or
β-catenin signaling are being extensively studied for
the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis [36–38].

patients, indicating a possible clinical relevance for their
involvement in metastasis.
Taken together, we showed evidence that
GalNAc-T14 expression is responsible for Wnt/βcatenin-dependent HOXB9 expression, which was
critical for increased metastatic potential in lung
adenocarcinoma. Thus, targeting β-catenin with a small
molecule in GalNAc-T14- and HOXB9-expressing
lung cancers may be an effective therapy to suppress
metastatic properties.

Migration assay

GRANT SUPPORT

For wound healing assay, after cells were packed in
the 6well plate, media was changed without FBS for 24 hrs.
A scratch was made on a uniform layer of cells using sterile
micropipette tip. Cell migration was monitored daily using
microscope and live image were taken by using Incucyte
cell live image system (Essen instruments, WelWyn
Garden City,UK). For migration assay, coverslip on which
cells were plated compactly was transfer to empty 6well
plate as previously described [43]. After 4 days cells,
which migrated off coverslip were photographed. The pixel
count of area of cell migration was obtained with ImageJ
software (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).

This research was supported by grants
(No. 2014R1A2A2A01005970, 2011-0030043 and
HI14C3365) from the National Research Foundation of
Korea (NRF) and the Korea Healthcare technology R&D
Project, Ministry for Health & Welfare Affairs.

Survival analyses were performed with TCGA (The
Cancer Genome Atlas, http://cancergenome.nih.gov/)
database and on-line survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier
plotter and DRUGSV [44]). TCGA is the RNA-Seq V2
data of lung adenocarcinoma. For TCGA data, the number
of reads mapping to genes (raw_counts) was normalized
using edgeR package with statistical software R (http://
www.r-project.org/), then the normalized read counts were
converted to log2 RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript
per Million mapped reads) values [45, 46]. Kaplan-Meier
and Cox regression analyses were performed using
survival package.
