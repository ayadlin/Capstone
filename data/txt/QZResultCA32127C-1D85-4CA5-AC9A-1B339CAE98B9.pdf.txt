Abstract
The discovery of oncogenic driver mutations and the subsequent developments in targeted therapies have led to improved
outcomes for subsets of lung cancer patients. The identiﬁcation of
additional oncogenic and drug-sensitive alterations may similarly
lead to new therapeutic approaches for lung cancer. We identify
and characterize novel FGFR2 extracellular domain insertion
mutations and demonstrate that they are both oncogenic and
sensitive to inhibition by FGFR kinase inhibitors. We demonstrate
that the mechanism of FGFR2 activation and subsequent

transformation is mediated by ligand-independent dimerization
and activation of FGFR2 kinase activity. Both FGFR2-mutant
forms are predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum
and Golgi but nevertheless can activate downstream signaling
pathways through their interactions with ﬁbroblast growth factor
receptor substrate 2 (FRS2). Our ﬁndings provide a rationale for
therapeutically targeting this unique subset of FGFR2-mutant
cancers as well as insight into their oncogenic mechanisms. Cancer

beneﬁt from targeted therapy could have signiﬁcant clinical
relevance.
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) is a member of
the FGFR family. FGFRs have a core structure containing an
extracellular domain (ECD), a hydrophobic transmembrane
domain, and an intracellular kinase domain. FGF ligand binding
results in FGFR dimerization, followed by receptor autophosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling, playing
key roles in multiple biologic processes such as tissue repair,
angiogenesis, and embryonic development (5). Aside from their
normal physiological roles, aberrant FGFR signaling has been
implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancers (6). The
FGFR signaling pathway can be activated in various ways.
Ampliﬁcation of FGFR1 and mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3
have been identiﬁed in squamous cell lung carcinomas (7, 8).
Recently identiﬁed FGFR gene rearrangements, involving FGFR1,
FGFR2, and FGFR3, occur in diverse cancers, including in glioblastomas, cholangiocarcinomas, and cancers of the bladder,
thyroid, mouth, breast, head and neck, and lung (9–11).
These FGFR genetic alterations are oncogenic and sensitive to
FGFR-TKIs, suggesting that a new subset of cancers might be
treatable with FGFR-targeted therapies.
In this study, we identify and study novel FGFR2 extracellular
domain insertion mutations. We characterize both the oncogenicity and FGFR inhibitor sensitivity of cells harboring these
mutations. Finally, we evaluate the underlying mechanism supporting oncogenic signaling.

Materials and Methods

The discovery of oncogenic driver genes has helped identify
druggable targets and the subsequent development of new therapies using small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for a
broad range of cancers. Detection of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
rearrangements in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is currently standard of care, leading to dramatically improved outcomes in patients with these genetic alterations when treated with
an EGFR or ALK TKIs, respectively, as compared with systemic
chemotherapy (1, 2). A number of new potentially targetable
oncogenic gene alterations have been further characterized in
recent years (3). However, even with recent intense research
efforts, there still remain a signiﬁcant proportion of cancer
patients whose cancers do not harbor any known oncogenic
alterations. Given the fact that cancer is the leading cause of death
worldwide and accounts for 8.2 million deaths annually (4),
identifying even a small subpopulation of patients who might

at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI)/Brigham and Women's
Hospital undergoing routine NGS (15) provided informed consent as part of an Institutional Review Board approved institutional wide sequencing effort.
For detection of FGFR2 mutations in the 96 tumors from never
smokers, DNA was extracted from parafﬁn-embedded or frozen
tissues using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen) or the
DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen), respectively, and was
ampliﬁed via PCR. Primers used for the ampliﬁcation are: forward
primer 50 -ACTGACAGCCCTCTGGACAACAC-30 , reverse primer
50 -ACCCCAGTTGTGGGTACCTTTAGA-30 .
Cell culture and reagents
NIH-3T3 cells were purchased from the ATCC in 2010. Authentication of the cell line was performed using karyotyping at the
Brigham and Women's CytoGenomics Core Laboratory in May
2015. The cells with or without each gene alteration were maintained in DMEM medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/
mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. BGJ398 was
obtained from ChemieTek and ponatinib from Selleck Chemicals.
FGF-1 ligand and Endo Hf were purchased from R&D Systems and
New England Biolabs, respectively.
Expression constructs and lentiviral infection
Full-length FGFR2 cDNA from DF/HCC DNA Resource Core
was cloned into pDNR-Dual (BD Biosciences) as described previously (16). To generate FGFR2 mutants, A266_S267ins,
A266_S267ins K517R, 290_291WI>C, T730S, or V755I were
introduced using site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent) with
mutant-speciﬁc primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. FGFR2–TACC3 fusions were created via a two-step PCR
reaction (Phusion Kit, NEB). TACC3 and FGFR2 sequence fragments were ampliﬁed from existing A549 (ATCC: CCL-185)
cDNA and a pDNR-dual plasmid stock respectively under the
manufacture's recommended conditions. Anticipated amplicon
fragments for each gene were gel puriﬁed, combined, and reampliﬁed to create FGFR2–TACC3. The PCR primers are available
upon request. All constructs were conﬁrmed by DNA sequencing.
Retroviral infection and culture of NIH-3T3 cells were done using
previously described methods (17). Polyclonal cell lines were
established by puromycin selection.
Soft-agar colony formation assay
Two milliliters of 0.5% noble agar (Sigma Aldrich Co.) and
media were plated in each well of a six-well plate and allowed to
solidify. A total of 1  104 cells were suspended in a ﬁnal
concentration of 0.35% agar with or without drug and plated
onto the solidiﬁed bottom layer in triplicate. Plates were incubated for 21 days, then the colonies were stained with 0.005%
crystal violet, and the numbers of colonies were counted.
Antibodies
Anti-phospho-FGFR (Tyr653/654), anti-phospho-FRS2
(Tyr436), anti-phospho Akt (Ser473), anti-total Akt, and
anti-a-tubulin were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.
Total ERK1/2 and phopho-ERK1/2 (pT185/pY187), Alexa Fluor488, and Alexa Fluor-549 antibodies were from Invitrogen. Antibodies against total FRS2, FGFR2 (C-17 and H-80), calnexin,
GM130, and HSP90 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-Flag was obtained from Sigma Aldrich Co.

Western blotting
Cell lysis and western blotting were done as previously
described (17). Visualization of unreduced dimers was done
using previously described methods (8). For ligand stimulation condition, cells expressing FGFR2 wild-type were cultured
for 8 hours in the presence of FGF-1 (40 ng/mL) and heparin (100
ng/mL). For EndoHf digestions, 20 mg of lysate were subjected to
digestion according to the manufacture's recommendations.
Xenograft experiment
All care of experimental animals were in accordance with
Harvard Medical School/DFCI institutional animal care and
followed committee guidelines. Nu/Nu mice were purchase from
Charles River Laboratories International Inc. and housed in a
DFCI animal facility. The expression level of FGFR2 in each NIH3T3 cell line was conﬁrmed by Western blot. Mice were injected
subcutaneously with 1  106 cells per shot, two to three spots/
mouse. The experimental mice were divided into two groups
according to the injected cell lines: (i) FGFR2 A266_S267ins,
Parental 3T3, FGFR2 wild-type and (ii) FGFR2 A266_S267ins,
FGFR2 A266_S267ins K517R, ﬁve mice per group. After 2 weeks of
implantation, tumors were monitored twice weekly and volumes
were calculated with the formula: (mm3) ¼ length  width 
width  0.5. Standard deviations were calculated using Graphpad
Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Cell surface protein isolation and immunoprecipitation
Cell surface protein isolation was done using a biotinylationbased assay using the Pierce Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Flow-through lysates were examined by
immunoprecipitation as previously described (18) using an
anti-Flag-tag antibody.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized
in 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated in the
indicated primary antibodies for 1 hour, followed by incubation
with ﬂuorescent conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour.
Nuclei were counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.
Cells were visualized and photographed on a Nikon ECLIPSE 80i
using NIS-Elements AR software (Nikon Instruments Inc.).

Results
Novel FGFR2 gene alterations detected in solid tumors
We ﬁrst studied the tumor of a 37-year-old male never smoker
with advanced NSCLC. The patient received two cycles of cisplatin
and etoposide as ﬁrst-line systemic therapy but developed progressive disease. While sequencing was being performed, he was
treated with second-line docetaxel chemotherapy. The patient had
a dramatic response to docetaxel lasting over 8 months. A biopsy
of a bone metastasis revealed NSCLC with neuroendocrine features. The tumor contained prominent glandular differentiation
with mucin production and positive staining by IHC for CD56
and TTF-1 and was negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin
(Supplementary Fig. S1 and data not shown). Further analysis by
targeted NGS revealed the presence of a novel insertion in FGFR2.
This insertion mutation, A266_S267insSTVVGGD, is a duplication of 21 bp in the ECD of FGFR2 (Fig. 1A and B) and is somatic
as determined by analyzing saliva extracted DNA (data not
shown). No other genomic alteration was detected in this

patient's sample using targeted NGS. We next analyzed 96 additional NSCLCs (18 tumor samples that were either carcinoids (n ¼
13) or NSCLCs with neuroendrocrine features (n ¼ 5) and 78
adenocarcinomas from never smokers with no known oncogenic
alterations (13, 14) for mutations in FGFR2 ECD but did not
identify any additional insertion mutations. We further queried a
DFCI/Brigham and Women's Hospital database of all cancer
patients who had undergone targeted NGS for presence of FGFR2
ECD mutations. Among 2,500 patients sequenced, we identiﬁed
21 with FGFR2 mutations (Supplementary Table S1). One of the
patients, with cholangiocarcinoma, had an FGFR2 ECD mutation
(290_291WI>C) and was chosen for further study. In addition,
two patients with NSCLC had T730S and V755I mutations located
within the kinase domain of FGFR2 (Fig. 1A). We used an FGFR2–
TACC3 fusion gene, recently discovered in cholangiocarcinoma
(19), with most of tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR2, fused to the
coiled-coil domain of TACC3 (Fig. 1A), as a control in our studies.
FGFR2 A266_S267ins, FGFR2 290_291WI>C, and FGFR2–
TACC3 are oncogenic and sensitive to FGFR-TKIs
To determine whether these FGFR2 mutations are oncogenic, we
expressed each gene alteration in NIH-3T3 cells and evaluated
resultant growth in soft agar. FGFR2 A266_S267ins, FGFR2
290_291WI>C, and FGFR2–TACC3 signiﬁcantly increased colony
formation in anchorage-independent conditions as compared with
wild-type FGFR2 (Fig. 2A), whereas this effect was not observed in
cells expressing FGFR2 T730S or those with V755I (Fig. 2A).

further evaluated the effect of BGJ398 on signal transduction in

these cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed greater phosphorylation
of the FGFR2 substrate FRS2 in cells expressing FGFR2
A266_S267ins, FGFR2 290_291WI>C, or FGFR2–TACC3. BGJ398
inhibited phospho-FRS2, accompanied by a concomitant inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in these cells. On the
contrary, FRS2 activation was hardly observed in cells expressing
wild-type FGFR2, T730S, or V755I (Fig. 2C). A pan-FGFR inhibitor
AP24534 (ponatinib) also had signiﬁcant inhibitory effects on
phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-AKT as well as phospho-FRS2 in
FGFR2 A266_S267ins, FGFR2 290_291WI>C, and FGFR2–TACC3
cells, but not in FGFR2 wild-type cells, T730S or V755I cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2). These data suggest that cells expressing
FGFR2 A266_S267ins, FGFR2 290_291WI>C, and those with
FGFR2–TACC3 are dependent on FGFR signaling. Consistently,
cells expressing the kinase dead version of FGFR2 A266_S267ins,
FGFR2 A266_S267ins K517R, formed fewer colonies (Fig. 2D). We
further conﬁrmed that FGFR2 A266_S267ins is sufﬁcient to induce
tumor formation in vivo using xenografts, whereas cells expressing
FGFR2 A266_S267ins K517R had signiﬁcantly smaller tumors
(Fig. 2E), additionally conﬁrming FGFR kinase-dependent
oncogenicity.
Given that both FGFR2 A266_S267ins and FGFR2
290_291WI>C alterations reside in the Ig3 ligand-binding
domain of ECD, we further evaluated the effect of FGF stimulation
in FGFR2 A266_S267ins compared with cells expressing wild-type
FGFR2. In FGFR2 A266_S267ins cells, elevated basal FRS2 phosphorylation levels precluded further increases following FGF
stimulation as compared with cells expressing wild-type FGFR2
(Supplementary Fig S3A). We also observed greater colony formation with FGF stimulation in FGFR2 wild-type cells, whereas
FGF had little additional effect in cells with FGFR2 A266_S267ins,

these data suggest that FGFR2 A266_S267ins leads to FGF-independent oncogenic transformation with little, if any, additional
effect from exogenous FGF.

TACC3 form dimers
To identify the mechanistic basis for the oncogenicity of these
mutant FGFR2 proteins, we examined whether the receptors
dimerize in a ligand-independent fashion. Immunoblot analysis
in nonreducing condition revealed that FGFR2 A266_S267ins
and FGFR2 290_291WI>C form dimers as detected using either an
anti-FLAG antibody or an anti-FGFR2 antibody (Fig. 3). FGFR2

sure (Fig. 3). In cells expressing FGFR2–TACC3, dimer bands were
observed only with the anti-FLAG antibody, but not with the antiFGFR2 antibody as this fusion protein lacks the C-terminal
portion of FGFR2 that is recognized by this FGFR2 antibody.
These data suggest that FGFR2 A266_S267ins, FGFR2

indicated genetic alterations were probed for the formation of receptor dimerizations. For the ligand stimulation experiments, cells with FGFR2 wild-type were
stimulated with FGF-1 and heparin for 8 hours before harvest. Open arrows, monomer bands; solid arrows, dimers.

A266_S267ins and FGFR2 290_291WI>C were found to show
higher expression levels of the lower band (open arrow)
detected by either an anti-FGFR2 antibody or an anti-FLAG
antibody, compared with FGFR2 wild-type and the other mutations or translocations evaluated in this study (Fig. 4A). To
prove that the higher expressed lower band in cells with ECD
mutations was due to a partially processed receptor, cell lysates
were digested with endoglycosidase (Endo Hf), which is speciﬁc for the high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides characteristic of proteins that have not completed Golgi-mediated
maturation of glycosylation. Endo Hf digestion results in a shift
in molecular mass from a primarily 110-kDa to a primarily 85kDa band (open arrow) in both FGFR2 A266_S267ins cells and
FGFR2 290_291WI>C cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that FGFR2
receptors with those ECD mutations mainly exist as partially
glycosylated forms.
FGFR2 A266_S267ins, FGFR2 290_291WI>C, and FGFR2–
TACC3 express in cytoplasm and colocalize with Golgi and ER
markers
To determine whether the FGFR2 mutations lead to altered
cellular localization of FGFR2 proteins, we evaluated the cellular
localization using an immunoﬂuorescence assay. In FGFR2
wild-type cells, immunoﬂuorescence signals detected by both
an anti-FGFR2 and anti-Flag antibodies were detected primarily
in the plasma membrane and also perinuclearly to a lesser

degree (Fig. 5A). However, in cells with FGFR2 A266_S267ins,
FGFR2 290_291WI>C, or FGFR2–TACC3, the staining was
localized primarily in a perinuclear pattern (Fig. 5A). Given
this cytoplasmic distribution pattern, we next performed a coimmunoﬂuorescence assay using antibodies against the ER
marker, calnexin, and the Golgi marker, GM130. The FGFR2
immunoﬂuorescence performed in cells with FGFR2
A266_S267ins, FGFR2 290_291WI>C, and FGFR2–TACC3
demonstrated colocalization with calnexin (Fig. 5B) and
GM130 (Fig. 5C), suggesting that these mutant FGFR2 proteins
predominately localize in the ER/Golgi. In contrast, colocalization with calnexin and GM130 was not observed in cells
expressing wild-type FGFR2. We next used biotin labeling as
a complementary method to determine the cellular location of
wild-type and mutant FGFR2 proteins. Biotinylation and the
subsequent isolation of cell surface proteins revealed that
FGFR2 wild-type is mainly present at the cell surface, whereas
FGFR2 A266_S267ins and FGFR2 290_291WI>C in the cytoplasm (Fig. 6A). The speciﬁcity of cell surface labeling by
biotinylation was conﬁrmed by the immunoblots for the cytoplasmic protein, HSP90. Cells with FGFR2–TACC3 translocation also showed cytoplasmic expression of FGFR2 (Fig. 6A).
We ﬁnally evaluated whether these ER/Golgi-located mutant
FGFR2 proteins are functional and can initiate signaling. We
performed immunoprecipitation with the ﬂow-through lysates
from the cell surface protein isolation assay, which contain

Targetable FGFR2 ECD Gene Alterations in Solid Cancer

Discussion
Aberrant FGFR signaling has been implicated in the development of several cancer types, including FGFR1 ampliﬁcation in
lung squamous cell carcinoma (7, 21), FGFR3 mutations in
urothelial carcinomas (22), and recently reported fusions of FGFR
family kinases with TACC or other genes in several cancer types
(9, 11, 23, 24). In this study, we identify novel, albeit rare, FGFR2
genetic alterations that are oncogenic and can be targeted with
FGFR inhibitors in solid tumors, including lung cancer.
FGFR2 point mutations have been well described in studies of
different diseases, such as craniosynotosis syndrome, gastric cancer, and endometrial carcinomas (6, 25–27). Furthermore, recent
studies suggest that FGFR2 might deﬁne a molecular subset in
other cancers as well, including NSCLC (8, 10, 19). FGFR2

290_291WI>C found in a cholangiocarcinoma patient localize to
the ECD of FGFR2. Although mutations in the ECD does not seem
to promote direct activation of FGFR2 kinase activity, they could
be oncogenic by changing the afﬁnity to ligand (28, 29), or lead to
ligand independent dimerization and subsequent activation of
FGFR2 signaling (8, 30, 31). In this study, we detected elevated
basal phosphorylation of FGFR and that of FRS2 in cells expressing these ECD mutations accompanied by dimer formation.
Together with the in vivo results, our data indicate that FGFR2
A266_S267ins and FGFR2 290_291WI>C are oncogenic mutations through dimer formation as a possible mechanism, but in a
ligand-independent manner.
We found that FGFR2 A266_S267ins and FGFR2 290_291WI>C
have altered receptor subcellular localization. Increased expression
levels of the incompletely glycosylated receptor support this ﬁnding since the full N-glycosylation of FGFR2 is considered to be
involved in normal trafﬁcking of the receptor to the cell surface
(32). Immunoﬂuorescent costaining for ER or Golgi markers
showed that these mutated receptor forms are predominantly
located within these intracellular compartments, whereas such
colocalization was not detectable in cells expressing wild-type
FGFR2. Similar to our observation, other FGFR2 ECD mutations
have been reported to lead to diminished FGFR2 glycosylation,
accompanied with altered localization of FGFR2 (32, 33). A crystal
structure study revealed that FGFR2 ECD mutation G271E can
cause local structure perturbations and destabilization, which
could interfere with dimers or receptor mislocalization by interfering with the correct receptor maturation and trafﬁcking (33). A
previous study has shown that incompletely glycosylated FGFR2
ECD mutations are able to dimerize (8) and activate signal transduction in the ER/Golgi (32), consistent with our ﬁnding. Furthermore, we showed that FGFR2–TACC3 localizes primarily in the
cytoplasm, and more precisely in the ER/Golgi. Although the
papers reporting FGFR–TACC fusions are still limited, it has been
shown that FGFR3–TACC3 fusion results in enhanced expression
of this fusion gene (23) and that FGFR3–TACC3 localizes in the
cytosol, in mitotic spindle polls (9). Conventional cell signaling
models involve initiation of signaling cascades of receptor tyrosine
kinases by ligand binding at the cells surface; however, recent
ﬁndings suggest that some of these signaling pathways can be
initiated within internal compartments (34, 35). Thus, an altered
expression or localization pattern of FGFR2 protein could be
involved in oncogenic mechanisms in addition to forming dimers.
Taken together, our data suggest that these novel FGFR2 ECD
mutations, A266_S277ins and 290_291WI>C, form dimers in a

ligand-independent fashion and activate signaling possibly
through diminished glycosylation of the receptor and altered
localization in the ER/Golgi. However, it remains to be elucidated
whether increased proportion of incompletely glycosylated FGFR2
results either from less efﬁcient trafﬁcking to the cell surface or from
more rapid endocytosis and degradation after trafﬁcking to the cell
surface. Moreover, the mechanism by which glycosylation is
involved in receptor trafﬁcking remains unclear, with further
investigations needed.
In summary, we have identiﬁed and characterized several drugsensitive FGFR2 gene alterations, providing a rationale for FGFRtargeted therapy in solid cancer. Reports of FGFR2 gene alterations,
especially in NSCLC, are still limited. There are 314 FGFR2 mutations from 87 published studies in cBioPortal for cancer genomics
and one W290C mutation has been reported in a lung squamous
cell carcinoma patient (36). Furthermore, recent study also reported
W290C mutation in lung squamous cell carcinoma (8). These data
support a rationale to investigate the frequency of these ECD
alterations together with the related clinic-pathologic features. Given
the number of cancer patients all over the world, identifying even a
small subpopulation of patients who may respond to targeted
therapy can have signiﬁcant therapeutic relevance.
