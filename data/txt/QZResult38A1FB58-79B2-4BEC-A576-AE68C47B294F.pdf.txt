BACKGROUND. Therapy for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with
hypomethylating agents, like decitabine and 5-azacitidine, has produced favorable results. In this study, the authors update their experience with decitabine in
MD

patients with MDS and analyze the cytogenetic response patterns and prognostic
factors associated with decitabine therapy.

METHODS. One hundred fifteen patients with higher risk MDS who received treatment with decitabine were reviewed. Patients received decitabine 100 mg/m2 per
course every 4 weeks in 3 different schedules: 1) 20 mg/m2 intravenously daily  5,
2) 20 mg/m2 subcutaneously daily  5, and 3) 10 mg/m2 intravenously daily  10.
Decitabine was given for a median of 7 courses (range, 1–23 courses).

RESULTS. Overall, 80 patients (70%) achieved a response according to the modiDepartment of Leukemia, The University of Texas
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

fied International Working Group criteria (IWG): complete response (CR), 40
patients (35%); partial response, 2 patients (2%); bone marrow CR with or without other hematologic improvements (HI), 26 patients (23%); and other HI, 12
patients (10%). Cytopenias were improved in 50% of patients. The median remission duration was 20 months, and the median survival was 22 months. Mortality
was 3% at 6 weeks and 7% at 3 months. In a multivariate analysis, poor prognostic factors for achieving IWG CR were MDS (vs chronic myelomonocytic leukemia), longer duration of MDS, and prior MDS therapy. For survival, independent
adverse prognostic factors were chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities, older
age, and prior MDS therapy (excluding growth factors).

CONCLUSIONS. The longer term experience with decitabine in MDS was favorable.

5-azacytidine have produced positive results in patients
with MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
(CMML).10–12 Both agents have received the approval of
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment
of MDS and CMML. They are considered lower intensity
therapies and have been associated with low myelosuppression-related treatment mortality. In this report, we
update our experience with decitabine in 115 patients
with MDS and CMML, analyze details of treatment
results and patterns of cytogenetic responses, and evaluate the prognostic factors associated with response and
survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Decitabine Study Group and Therapy
Adults who had a diagnosis of MDS or CMML who were
referred to The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center from November, 2003 through July, 2006
were offered decitabine therapy on the study after
informed consent was obtained according to institutional guidelines. Eligibility criteria included 1) age 16
years; 2) a diagnosis of IPSS intermediate- or high-risk
MDS or a diagnosis of CMML; 3) normal organ function, including creatinine 2 mg/dL and bilirubin
2 mg/dL. Patients who had received prior intensive
chemotherapy with cytarabine 1 g/m2 were not
eligible. The diagnosis of CMML was based on the typical morphologic picture, unexplained leukocytosis
>12  109/L that lasted 3 months, exclusion of other
myeloproliferative disorders, and the presence of
109/dL monocytes.
Patients were randomized to receive decitabine
in 1 of 3 schedules: 1) 20 mg/m2 intravenously over
1 hour daily  5, 2) 20 mg/m2 daily  5, given in 2
subcutaneous doses daily, or 3) 10 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour daily  10. All patients received
the same decitabine total dose per course, 100 mg/m2.
Preferential randomization to the arm that demonstrated a higher complete response (CR) rate started
after the 45th patient. Courses of decitabine were
given every 4 weeks, at least in the first 3 courses,
regardless of the counts, as long as 1) there were no
significant myelosuppressive, life-threatening complications with a particular course, such as pneumonia,
severe infection or bleeding, or severe organ damage;
and 2) there was evidence of persistent disease.
Therefore, bone marrow aspirations and biopsies
(including cytogenetics, if they were abnormal before
therapy) were performed before every course to
decide whether to deliver the courses every 4 weeks,
until CR, or for the first 3 courses (whichever came
first), then every 2 or 3 courses. Patients were considered not to have responded only after they received

3 courses of therapy unless prohibitive toxicities,
clear progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
or patient request did not allow delivery of such
therapy. Thus, timely and repeated courses of decitabine every 4 weeks (rather than 6 to 8 weeks, as in
previous studies) for a minimum of 3 courses was an
important feature of the decitabine dose-schedule
delivery in this study.
No dose escalations were considered. Dose
reductions by 25% to 30%, rounded to 15 mg/m2,
10 mg/m2, 7.5 mg/m2, and 5 mg/m2, were allowed for
grade 3 and 4 nonmyelosuppressive toxicities, for
severe myelosuppression-associated complications
(infections, bleeding), or for prolonged myelosuppression, which was defined as a hypocellular bone marrow (5% cellularity) without evidence of disease for
6 weeks after the start of a course of therapy. Other
dose modifications, eg, 50% dose reductions, were
considered occasionally for severe complications if
they were deemed to be in the best safety interest of
the patient. The use of erythropoietin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor were allowed as indicated by the clinical condition. Antibiotic prophylaxis
and therapy for fever of infections was used according
to institutional guidelines. In general, subcutaneous
erythropoietin (40,000 units weekly) was allowed for
red cell transfusion dependence or for a hemoglobin
level <10 g/dL. Subcutaneous granulocyte-colony
stimulating factor (300–480 mcg) was given if the
granulocyte count was <109/L in the setting of a febrile episode or documented infection or in a patient
who was in CR but with a granulocyte count <109/L
prior to the initiation of the next course of decitabine. The details of the study have been reported
previously.12
The study group has accrued a total of 115
patients. The characteristics of patients are shown in
Table 1.

Response Criteria and Statistical Considerations
At the time of the study design, the criteria for a CR and
a partial response (PR) were identical to those used in
patients with AML, ie, they did not require a durability
of response 4 weeks. The criteria for hematologic
improvements (HI) also were similar but, again, did not
require a response durability 8 weeks.13 The adaptive
randomization was based on the incidence of CR in
the 3 schedules.12,14 When the International Working
Group (IWG) response criteria gained acceptance and
were modified, we recoded responses according to
the modified IWG criteria15,16 to allow comparisons
of the decitabine results with other agents and/or
regimens.

IPSS indicates International Prognostic Scoring System; MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome.

Response criteria of the IWG for CR and PR were
similar to those used for AML but required response
durability for 4 weeks and improvement of hemoglobin to 11g/dL. A CR required normalization of
the bone marrow and peripheral counts with 5%
bone marrow blasts, a granulocyte count 109/L,
and a platelet count 100  109/L that lasted for
4 weeks. A PR was similar to a CR except for persistent bone marrow blasts >5% that were reduced by
50%. A bone marrow CR referred to reduction in
bone marrow blasts to 5% without normalization of
peripheral counts.16
All HI was coded according to the modified IWG
criteria: HI-E referred to a hemoglobin increase by
1.5g/dL or transfusion independence; HI-P referred
to an absolute increase in the platelet count from

267

<20  109/L to >20  109/L and by 100% or, if the
pretreatment platelets were >20  109/L, by an absolute increase 30  109/L; and HI-N referred to a
granulocyte increase of 100% and by an absolute
increase of 0.5  109/L. HIs were required to last for
2 months. Persistence of dysplastic changes in CR
was allowed.16
Cytogenetic responses were defined as reported
previously16: a cytogenetic CR referred to disappearance of the cytogenetic abnormality, and a cytogenetic
PR referred to a reduction 50% in the cytogenetic abnormality. Response duration was dated from the first
evidence of a response until disease progression, as
defined by the IWG. Survival was dated from the start
of therapy. The time to transformation was dated from
the start of therapy until increased blasts 30%.
The statistical design of the decitabine study used
on adaptive randomization with the Bayesian method
of Berry,14 as described previously.12 In total, we
planned to treat up to 95 patients. After the 65th
patient, the 5-day intravenously schedule was selected
as optimal, and the remaining 30 patients were treated
on this arm. Because of the activity of this schedule, the
study was amended to increase the number up to 120
patients. Toxicities were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute/Common Toxicity Criteria
guidelines, version 3.
Survival and response duration probabilities were
calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in CR rates and survival were compared
according to pretreatment characteristics and therapies by using subgroups of clinically relevant categories. Differences in CR rates were compared by using
the chi-square test. Comparison of survivals used the
log-rank test.17 Factors that were significant in the univariate analysis (P<.05) were considered for inclusion
in multivariate models. Multivariate analyses were
conducted using a logistic regression model for CR
rates and the Cox proportional-hazards model for
survival.18,19

RESULTS
The characteristics of the decitabine study group are
detailed in Table 1. Their median age was 64 years,
and 70% of patients were aged 60 years. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 60% of patients.
The median duration of MDS was 3 months. Bone
marrow blasts >10% were present in 43% of patients,
and various degrees of cytopenias were present in
47% to 76% of patients. Prior therapy had been
received by 60% of patients. Secondary MDS was
noted in 30%. IPSS risk was not categorized in 45 of
115 patients, because they had secondary MDS or

noteworthy that the original IPSS analysis study targeted primary newly diagnosed MDS. The implication is that prior therapy was not allowed, although
65 of 816 patients (8%) in that study had received
minimal prior therapy.5

Overall Response to Decitabine by the Modified
IWG Criteria
Responses according to the modified IWG criteria are
summarized in Table 2. Overall, 40 patients (35%)
achieved a CR, and 80 patients (70%) had an objective response. The CR rates by decitabine schedule
are shown in Table 2. An adaptive randomization
design14 was used to select the schedule of decitabine 20 mg/m2 intravenously daily  5 days after the
65th patient, because it was the schedule associated
with a higher CR rate, as discussed above and
reported previosuly.12
The median follow-up on the decitabine study
was 14 months (range, 1–32 months), and the median number of decitabine courses was 7 (range, 1–
23 courses). Thirty-four of 115 patients continued on
decitabine therapy. Among 74 patients who were
entered on the study for 6 months, the median
number of courses was 10 (range, 2–23 courses),
and only 2 of those patients (3%) received <3 courses
of decitabine.
The median survival was 22 months, and the estimated 2-year survival rate was 47%. The median time
to development of AML was not reached (Fig. 1). The
2-year survival rate was 40% among patients aged
60 years versus 63% in younger patients (Fig. 2).

FIGURE 2. Survival with decitabine by age 60 years and age <60
years.

Among 87 patients who had red cell transfusion
dependence or hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL, 40
patients (46%) improved their hemoglobin levels by
1.0 g/dL or became transfusion independent.
Response of thrombocytopenia was particularly relevant. Among 83 patients who had pretreatment platelet
counts <100  109/L, 41 patients (49%) ultimately
achieved platelet counts 100  109/L. Such responses
were noted in 5 of 19 patients (26%) who had pretreatment platelet counts <20  109/L, in 17 of 35 patients
(48%) who had platelet counts from 20  109/L to
50  109/L, and in 19 of 29 patients (66%) who had platelet counts from 51  109/L to 99  109/L. The estimated 2-year survival rates in the 3 groups were 19%,
46%, and 48%, respectively. The 1-year survival rate
dated from 3 months into therapy according to platelet

responses (>100  109/L) was 88% for responders and
63% for nonresponders (P ¼ .001). According to the
IWG response criteria, 50 of 83 patients (60%) with pretreatment platelet counts <100  109/L had an HI-P
response, either an increase from < 20  109/L to
>20  109/L and at least a 100% increase (10 of 19
patients; 53%) or an absolute increase in the platelet
count 30  109/L (40 of 64 patients; 62%) that lasted
for 2 months.

Cytogenetic Responses
Pretreatment cytogenetic abnormalities were present
in 69 of 115 patients who received decitabine
(Table 3). A cytogenetic CR was observed in 24 of 69
patients (35%), including 14 of 21 patients who had a

morphologic CR, 8 of 28 patients who had other
responses, and 2 patients without any IWG response.
A cytogenetic PR was noted in 11 additional patients
(16%). At first documentation of morphologic CR, 11
of 21 patients still had persistence of chromosomal
abnormalities; these disappeared with continued
decitabine therapy in 4 of 11 patients (36%; or 4 of
21 patients overall; 19%).
Cytogenetic responses and estimated survival in
patients with different chromosomal abnormalities
are shown in Table 3. Table 4 cross-tabulates morphologic and cytogenetic responses by IWG criteria.

Prognostic Factors for Response and Survival
With Decitabine
To investigate whether select patients may benefit
preferentially from decitabine therapy, we used univariate (Table 5) and multivariate (Table 6) analyses
to evaluate the prognostic factors associated with CR
and with survival on decitabine therapy. The CR rates
were higher in patients who had IPSS intermediate-1
risk disease, but the trend was not significant considering the small numbers of patients. Survival was
better, as expected, in intermediate-risk versus highrisk IPSS groups (Fig. 3). In the multivariate analysis,
the selected, independent, poor prognostic factor for
IWG CR were prior therapy for MDS (P ¼ .02), MDS
rather than CMML (P ¼ .02), and longer duration of
MDS disease (P ¼ .03). Patients with none or 1, 2, or
3 adverse factors had CR rates of 53%, 16%, and 7%,
respectively (Table 6).
The multivariate analysis of prognostic factors
for survival selected the following as independent,
poor prognostic factors: chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities (P < .01); older age (P ¼ .01), and prior MDS

were fever of unknown origin in 3% of courses, documented bacterial infections in 4% of courses, pneumonias in 2.5% of courses, confirmed or suspected
fungal infections in 0.7% of courses, grade 1 and 2
bleeding in 5% of courses, and grade 3 and 4 bleeding in 1% of courses. Hospitalization for complications was required in 14% of courses. With a median
of 7 courses, 39 of 115 patients (34%) never
required any hospitalization. Mortality was very low
in the first 3 months and was attributed mostly to
myelosuppression-related complications or disease
progression.

DISCUSSION
In this study, lower intensity therapy with decitabine
appeared to be associated with a favorable outcome.
The CR rate was 35% with decitabine therapy, and the
overall response rate was 70%. The adaptive randomization Bayesian design14 selected the decitabine
schedule of 20 mg/m2 intravenously daily  5 as the
schedule associated with the higher CR rate. The early
(6-week) mortality (3%) and the 3-month mortality
(7%) were lower than those reported in previous studies with intensive chemotherapy.7 This resulted in
a favorable overall survival with decitabine (median

survival, 22 months) (Fig. 1). Survival was worse in
older patients than in younger patients (Fig. 2), as
expected. These data suggest a potential role of decitabine as maintenance postintensive chemotherapy in
patients with higher risk MDS or AML as part of noncross-resistant, sequential combination strategies.
The median number of courses was 7; among
patients who were entered on the study for 6 months
of follow-up, the median number of courses was 10.
This suggests that, as the learning curve improves
regarding the management of MDS and cytopenias,
with the knowledge of the need for multiple courses
to achieve CR, most patients (97%) should receive 3
courses of therapy to optimize their treatment and
evaluate their response.
These results compare favorably with the results
reported with either decitabine or 5-azacitidine in
the previous randomized trials.10,11 The CR rate with
decitabine on the current study was 35% (median,
7 courses): It was 9% in the decitabine randomized
study (median, 3 courses) and 6% with 5-azacitidine
(median, 9 courses).20 This may reflect the dose intensity of the current decitabine approach versus the
decitabine randomized study. However, the higher
CR rate with decitabine in the current study versus
5-azacitidine, considering a comparable number of
courses and the finding that intermediate 2-high risk
IPSS was noted in 45% of patients on this study
versus 28% of patients on the azacitidine study, suggests a possible therapeutic advantage with decitabine. This may also be explained by differences in

study groups, dose-intensity of therapy (courses every 4 weeks versus every 6–8 weeks), or other factors.
This issue needs to be evaluated in a randomized
trial of decitabine versus 5-azacitidine in MDS.
The pattern of cytogenetic responses on decitabine also was of interest. With intensive chemotherapy, a morphologic CR occurs rapidly (within 1 or 2
courses) and almost always is associated with an early
cytogenetic CR. The median number of courses to CR
with decitabine was 3 (range, 1–9 courses). Among 69
patients who had chromosomal abnormalities prior to
decitabine, 52% had persistent chromosomal abnormalities in first documented morphologic CR that disappeared with continued therapy in an additional
19% of patients. It is noteworthy that the cytogenetic
CR rate was 44% with lenalidomide, whereas the morphologic CR rate was only 27% in patients with MDS
and chromosome 5q abnormalities.21 This suggests
that some patients may not be evaluated as being in
CR because of persistent dysplastic changes, which
may be subjective or therapy-induced rather than
caused by persistent disease.
The prognostic factors associated with CR and
survival with decitabine were identified in multivariate analyses. These factors help to estimate different
rates for CR (range, 7–53%) and survival (range of
estimated 1.5-year survival rates, 33–82%) and to
advise patients on their expected outcome with decitabine versus other therapies.
Patients who are referred to The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center usually have a
worse outcome than newly diagnosed patients with
MDS. This probably is because their referral was
prompted, during the course of the disease, by events/
factors that necessitated an opinion or change of therapy (eg, worsening cytopenias, progression on supportive care measures, failure of prior therapy). For
example, the median survival of patients with IPSS intermediate-1 risk is 1.2 years in patients who are
referred to our institution7 versus 3.6 years in the original IPSS study.5 The IPSS model excluded patients
who received prior therapies (only 65 of 816 patients
[8%] had received minimal prior therapies). Prior therapy for MDS was received by 61% of our patients.
These patients usually have a significantly worse prognosis (as indicated by our multivariate analysis) and
cannot be compared with untreated patients. Moreover, the IPSS model excludes patients who have secondary MDS and CMML with a white blood cell count
>12  109/L. Thus, the application of the IPSS model
to current trials may be limited by the fact that most
patients may have received prior therapies and that
30% may have secondary MDS. The application of a
modified IPSS model that accounts for duration of

MDS, extent of prior therapy, and secondary MDS may
help to assess the prognosis for all patients with MDS
at any point during the course of their disease.
The toxicity profile with decitabine was reasonable. Extramedullary toxicities were uncommon. The
myelosuppression-associated complications were acceptable. The incidence of hospitalization for febrile
episodes was 14% per course. The possible occurrence of a 1-time hospitalization event per patient
increases as more courses of effective therapy are
delivered. Thus, with a median of 7 courses, 66% of
patients have required a 1-time hospitalization. The
reported incidence of severe (mostly myelosuppressive-related) complications in the azacitidine study
was 60%,20 similar to our experience.
In summary, the current analysis showed a favorable longer term outcome with decitabine as a lower
intensity hypomethylating strategy in patients with
higher risk MDS. It also identified prognostic factors
that predict for different risks for achieving CR and
for survival.
