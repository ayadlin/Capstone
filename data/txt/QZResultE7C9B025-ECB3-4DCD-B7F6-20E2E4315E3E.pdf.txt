ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) retain the capacity to propagate themselves through
self-renewal and to produce heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells constituting the
tumor. Novel drugs that target CSCs can potentially eliminate the tumor initiating cell
population therefore resulting in complete cure of the cancer. We recently established
a CSC-like model using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to reprogram
and partially differentiate human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. Using the
induced CSC-like (iCSCL) model, we developed a phenotypic drug assay system to
identify agents that inhibit the stemness and self-renewal properties of CSCs. The
selectivity of the agents was assessed using three distinct assays characterized by
cell viability, cellular stemness and tumor sphere formation. Using this approach,
we found that withaferin A (WA), an Ayurvedic medicine constituent, was a potent
inhibitor of CSC stemness leading to cellular senescence primarily via the induction of
p21Cip1 expression. Moreover, WA exhibited strong anti-tumorigenic activity against
the iCSCL. These results indicate that our iCSCL model provides an innovative high
throughput platform for a simple, easy, and cost-effective method to search for novel
CSC-targeting drugs. Furthermore, our current study identified WA as a putative drug
candidate for abrogating the stemness and tumor initiating ability of CSCs.

INTRODUCTION

treatments such as chemotherapeutic agents and radiation
therapy resulting in treatment failure [5, 6]. In order to
overcome this treatment limitation, novel therapeutic
strategies should aim to eliminate CSCs which should
effectively eradicate the cancer initiating cell population
within tumor tissues [7].
The development of new treatment strategies
that target CSCs is one of the main goals of anticancer therapy. However, in general, a large-scale drug
screening process requires a large supply of stable and
homogeneous cells to ensure reproducibility of the assay
[8]. It is necessary to separate a sufficient number of
CSCs from tumor tissue, to amplify the CSCs while stably

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are defined as transformed
stem cells that possess characteristics associated with
normal stem cells, specifically the ability to self-renew
and to form hierarchical cancer tissues [1]. Accumulating
evidence has shown that CSCs reside in various solid
tumors where they function as a sub-population that plays
a critical role in tumor initiation, progression, metastasis,
and recurrence [2, 3]. Therefore, CSCs are considered
to be a source of the tumor initiation and dissemination
as well as the acquisition of malignant properties [4].
CSCs are commonly resistant to conventional anti-cancer

maintaining them in an undifferentiated state in vitro. To
date, the optimal cell culture conditions for amplifying
pure CSC populations remain undefined. In fact, in vitro
amplified CSCs are largely incompatible with the in
vivo tumor microenvironment resulting in cell death or
dormancy [9]. Moreover, cellular heterogeneity of bulk of
CSC populations may reduce the fidelity and feasibility
of drug screening assays [10]. Recently, several research
groups attempted to establish new human CSC models
[11, 12]. Currently, separation and purification of cancer
stem-like cells from some cancer cell lines is the most
common and easy method. Cancer stem-like cells can
be enriched by collecting cells expressing CSC markers
such as CD133 and CD44 [13, 14]. ALDEFLUOR™ is
a non-immunological method that identifies human stem/
progenitor cells based on their aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) activity [15]. Interestingly, co-expression of
CD133+ and CD44+ with high ALDH activity identified
an enriched CSC-like population within established
cancer cell lines [16]. An alternative approach for the
enrichment of CSCs is the use of transformed cancer
cell lines that were forced to undergo the tumor sphere
formation or the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) [17, 18]. These cells expressed surrogate CSC
markers and displayed putative tumorigenic properties
in vivo, which highlights the potential suitability of this
model for the discovery of compounds that can selectively
target CSCs [19]. Despite the advances in modeling CSCs,
the genetic variability with chromosomal instabilities in
over-passaged cell lines remains a limitation that prevents
consistent findings in large-scale drug screening assay.
Furthermore, tumor sphere culture cannot always enrich
cancer stem-like cells from cancer cell lines [20].
To overcome the aforementioned caveats, we
recently developed a novel method of inducing cancer
stem-like cells through the reprogramming and partial
differentiation of the immortalized human mammary
epithelial MCF-10A cell line which has a low genetic
mutation rate [21]. These cells, termed induced cancer
stem cell-like 10A (iCSCL-10A), express cancer stem
markers (CD44, CD133 and ALDH1) and show much
higher sphere forming ability than conventional cancer
cell lines even in regular cell culture media supplemented
with fetal bovine serum [22]. Furthermore, only several
hundreds of iCSCL-10A cells can form hierarchicallyorganized tumors in immunosuppressed mice in a short
period [22]. In our current study, we utilized iCSCL-10A
cells to identify agents that selectively prohibit the traits
of CSCs. Rather than simply identifying drugs that kill
CSCs, we sought to identify compounds that interfere with
the self-renewal and pluripotent properties of CSCs [23].
We found that Withaferin A (WA) was a putative anti-CSC
drug candidate that altered the tumorigenic properties of
CSC via the induction of cellular senescence. Our current
approach can thus provide an useful option for future
development of anti-CSC drugs.

Development of a drug screening assay system
based on CSC properties
We recently established a new CSC-like model,
iCSCL-10A cells, via the introduction of defined
reprogramming factors and subsequent partial cell
differentiation from MCF-10A cells [22, 24]. These
proliferating CSC-like cells express characteristic CSC
markers, display a malignant phenotype in vitro and
form tumors of multiple lineages following injection into
immunocompromised mice (Figure 1A) [25]. We utilized
iCSCL-10A cells for our high-throughput drug screening
assay to monitor phenotypic traits of CSCs in the presence
of various compounds. We aimed to identify compounds
that selectively target CSCs by monitoring the specific
properties of CSC, such as self-renewal and stemness,
without prominent cell toxicity. The activity/selectivity of
the agents was assessed using three distinct assays: 1) cell
viability assay for cell toxicity, 2) alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) assay for cellular stemness, and 3) tumor sphere
forming assay for self-renewal. The assays were designed
using the 96-well platform for large-scale drug screening
(Figure 1B).

Selection of drugs targeting CSC phenotype
As an initial trial, we plated the iCSCL-10A cells
in 96-well plates and tested 73 organic compounds
using our three assays in parallel (Figure 2A). We used
the compounds at relatively lower concentration (1 μM)
in order to avoid redundant cytotoxicity. The selective
toxicity against CSC-like cells was then determined using
the WST-8 assay to monitor cell viability (Figure 2B).
Cellular stemness was measured by monitoring expression
of the stem cell marker ALP (Figure 2C). Interestingly, we
found that a single compound (No. 36) drastically reduced
the number of ALP-positive cells with limited cytotoxicity
at 1 μM where cell viability was greater than 80%. The
compound was identified as Withaferin A (WA) (Figure
2B and C). We next conducted a high-throughput tumor
sphere formation assay. We designed a platform of tumor
sphere formation for as short as 48 hrs to maximize the
rapidity of the assay. We also noticed that WA significantly
suppressed tumor sphere formation highlighting its
function to abrogate the self-renewal ability of iCSCL10A cells (Figure 2D). Based on our initial finding, WA
was selected for further characterization.
We conducted parallel experiments using varying
concentrations of WA. Our results revealed that the
stemness of iCSCL-10A cells was abrogated at 0.25 μM
of WA as observed using the ALP assay, while the cell
viability was inhibited at concentrations greater than
8666

2μM of WA (Figure 3A,B). Tumor sphere formation was
inhibited at concentrations as low as 0.125 μM (Figure
3C, D). Collectively, these results indicate that WA could
selectively inhibit the stemness of iCSCL-10A cells at
relatively low concentrations compared to its impact on
cell viability at 10-fold to 15-fold higher concentrations.
We hereafter used 1μM WA in our further studies since the
effect of WA was prominent at this concentration despite
of the minimum cytotoxicity.
WA is the most abundant constituent of Withania
somnifera, also known as Ashwagandha, which has been
studied extensively for its biologically active constituents,
steroidal lactones and withanolides [26]. To further
explore the anti-CSC function of WA, we next investigated
the activity of three WA compound analogues, Withanone,
Withanolide A and 12-Deoxywithastramonolide (12DWS) (Figure 4A). The parallel experiments for ALP
staining and the tumor sphere assays revealed that none of
the WA analogues abrogated the stemness and self-renew

ability of iCSCL-10A cells (Figure 4B-E), suggesting that
the anti-CSC properties were specific to WA.

WA reduces the expression of stem cell and EMT
markers
We further examined the effects of WA on the
expression of stem cell markers on iCSCL-10A as measure
of stemness. It has been well established that the CD44+/
CD24low fraction identifies the CSC population in solid
tumors [13]. WA treatment significantly reduced for
this fraction of iCSCL-10A cells (Figure 5A). Reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis
demonstrated that the expression of stem cell markers,
ALDH1A1 and Nanog, were prominently reduced in
iCSCL-10A cells treated with WA as compared with
DMSO-treated control cells (Figure 5B). Concomitantly,
WA reduced the expression of specific stem cell markers

lineages. (B) Schematic of our drug screening method. To identify compounds with a low cytotoxicity and that abrogated CSC stemness,

SOX2 and Nanog as measured by immunoblotting (Figure
5C). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is closely
associated with the properties of CSCs [18]. We then
assessed whether WA treatment modulated the expression
of EMT regulators. WA treatment downregulated the
major EMT markers, Twist and Slug (Figure 5C).
Therefore, WA seems to play a dual role in iCSCL-10A
cells by suppressing the expression of both stem cell and
EMT markers.

profoundly inhibits the tumor invasion and migration
properties of CSCs.

WA disrupts the microenvironment of CSC-like
spheres
To examine the effect of WA on CSC
microenvironment, pre-formed tumor spheres were treated
with either WA or DMSO followed by morphological and
cell viability analyses (Figure 6A). It was notable that
WA significantly reduced the viable cell numbers forming
tumor spheres. Concomitantly, tumor spheres exhibited
irregular morphology with notched structure around the
rims upon WA treatment while no such inhibitory effect
was observed in cells treated with DMSO (Figure 6B, C).
These results suggest that WA can penetrate into tumor
spheres and may disrupt the microenvironment that can be
important for the maintenance of CSC stemness.

WA inhibits cell migration and invasion of iCSCL10A
A key property of CSCs is its invasive ability. To
examine the effect of WA on the invasion of CSCs, we
performed a chamber invasion assay using matrigel-coated
transwells. We found that WA treatment in iCSCL-10A
cells resulted in a markedly reduced capacity for the cells
to undergo invasion (Figure 5D).
Another important feature of CSCs is their increased
mobility. To evaluate whether WA affects CSC migration
in this context, wound-healing assays were performed. WA
treatment significantly inhibited the wound healing ability
of iCSCL-10A cells (Figure 5E). Therefore, WA treatment

experiments, iCSCL-10A cells were treated with varying
concentrations of WA in vitro for 72 hrs prior to injection
into immunosuppressed mice. We observed that iCSCL10A had a strong tumorigenic property forming tumor
mass for only 10 to 12 days as shown in DMSO-treated
control cells (Figure 6D). On the other hand, the pretreatment of WA had a dose-dependent anti-tumor effect
on iCSCL-10A cells in both tumor initiation and tumor
size (Figure 6D, E).

Next, we assessed the optimal duration for WA pretreatment for inhibiting tumor formation of CSCs. iCSCL10A cells were treated with 1.5 μM of WA for varying
hours prior to being injected into immunosuppressed
mice. WA pre-treatment for more than 24 hrs significantly
decreased both the tumor initiation and the tumor-forming
ability of iCSCL-10A cells (Figure 6F, G). Taken together,
these results indicate that the pre-treatment with WA can
abrogate the tumorigenic properties of iCSCL-10A cells.

phosphorylated H2AX foci in the WA treated cells but not
in the DMSO-treated cells (Figure 7B). However, DNA

revealed by comet assay (Figure 7C) [28]. These results
strongly indicate that the abrogation of CSC properties in
iCSCL-10A cells is mediated by WA-induced senescence.

kinase (pErk1/2), as a marker of MAPK activity, were
highly expressed in WA-treated cells during the course
of senescence (Figure 7D). Moreover, there was no
prominent cleavage of PARP (Figure 7D), strongly
suggesting that the cells underwent senescence rather than
apoptosis.

the biological functions of CSCs sought to overcome these
limitations by utilizing an iPSC technology for cellular
reprogramming and subsequent partial differentiation
of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells [24].
Although our technique manipulates iPS-like cells with
further differentiation and transformation, the cells
express CSC markers and retain the ability to differentiate
into multiple lineages of cancer cells following in vivo
transplantation into immunosuppressed mouse [22].
Forming the self-niche, cells can be maintained in regular
cell culture medium without the need for co-culturing
feeder cells to maintain the stemness. Our CSC-like model
system improves the ease of characterization of cancer
stem cells by enabling the examination of CSC-specific
functions, such as self-renewal and tumor-initiating
properties.
In our current study, we utilized three different
assays, cell viability, tumor sphere formation and
differentiation assays. Using our approach, we directly
analyzed stemness and tumorigenic properties of CSClike cells by monitoring their phenotypic features.
WA was identified as a potential anti-CSC compound
using our assay system, and was further validated with
subsequent biological analyses. In fact, WA abrogated
the maintenance of stemness and tumorigenicity via the
induction of cellular senescence. Given the selectivity
of our assay, future studies may be performed to identify
additional compounds that prohibit CSC properties in
large-scale analyses. In this regard, our approach would
be useful not only for the identification of new targets for
cancer therapy but also to improve the understanding of
molecular pathways involved in the maintenance of CSCs.
We demonstrate here that WA can abrogate the
tumorigenicity of CSC-like cells. WA is a steroidal lactone
that is extracted from traces in all parts of Withania
somnifera except its leaves [35]. Withania somnifera is
one of the most ancient herbs that is used as a medicine
and a dietary supplement [26]. Several previous studies
illustrated the anti-cancer activity of WA both in vitro and
in vivo [36, 37]. In fact, WA has been shown to induce
apoptosis of human leukemia cells via inhibition of JNK
and AKT signaling as well as inhibition of NF-κB activity
[38]. WA also inhibited the growth of breast cancer
cells by reducing the levels of Notch family proteins in
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells [39]. WA has been also
shown to induce mitotic catastrophe and growth arrest in
prostate cancer cells [40]. These results indicate that WA
may target distinct signaling molecules for its anti-cancer
activity depending on the type of cancer cell. Notably,
Kim et al. recently reported that WA treatment inhibited
the mammosphere formation in MCF-7 and SUM159
human breast cancer cell lines as well as mammary
epithelial cells derived from MMTV-neu mice [41]. In
addition to this, we here revealed a distinct function of WA
to target and disrupt self-renewal pathways of CSC via
inducing p21Cip1 and suppressing Twist thereby inducing

Ectopic p21Cip1 expression largely recapitulates
WA treatment in iCSCL-10A cells
In our iCSCL-10A cells, WA induced p21Cip1
during the course of cellular senescence. In previous
studies, expression of p21Cip1 was tightly linked to cellular
senescence [28, 32]. Therefore we evaluated whether
p21Cip1 played a role in WA-induced senescence and
resultant abrogation of CSC tumorigenicity. To test this
hypothesis, iCSCL-10A cells were transduced with the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 (CDKN1) encoding
p21Cip1 using a retrovirus vector followed by selection with
puromycin. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the stable
expression of the ectopic p21Cip1 in CDKN1-transduced
cells (Figure 8A). CDKN1-transduced cells, but not
control vector transduced cells, exhibited a flattened,
enlarged, and heterogeneous cell morphology which was
characteristic of cells in senescence (Figure 8B). These
cells also expressed SABG, which was not observed
among the control vector transduced cells (Figure 8B).
Concomitantly, the CD44+CD24low fraction within the
CSC population was significantly reduced in the CDKN1transduced cells (Figure 8C). Furthermore, CDKN1
transduction significantly reduced the rate of tumor sphere
formation (Figure 8D).
On the contrary, the targeted depletion of
endogenous p21Cip1 by two different forms of siRNA
prominently prohibited the WA-induced cellular
senescence in iCSCL-10A cells as revealed by SABG
staining in line with the suppression of WA-induced p21Cip1
expression (Figure 8E, F). Taken together these results
indicate that the expression of p21Cip1 can abrogate the
CSC properties of iCSCL-10A cells through the induction
of cellular senescence.

DISCUSSION
In our current study, we developed and used
an in vitro CSC-like model for the identification and
characterization of novel agents targeting CSCs based
on phenotypic properties. Several recent studies have
attempted to use cell sorting to enrich a subpopulation
of cancer cell lines as a potential CSC-like model
[33]. However, a major limitation of these studies is
the use of cell surface markers that may or may not be
restricted to CSCs, and in some cases may be improved
when combined with other properties [34]. Our current
approach for creating a CSC-like cell population to assay

cellular senescence program possibly via cell cycle arrest
and subsequent geroconversion (Figure 9). An improved
understanding of the molecular link between WA and its
regulation of CSC properties as revealed by in the current
study may shed new light on the molecular signature of
CSCs. Moreover, the identification of WA as a novel drug
that targets CSCs may validate the feasibility of our assay
system for anti-CSC drug discovery.
We show here that p21Cip1 plays a crucial role in
the abrogation of the malignant properties of CSCs via
the induction of senescence. p21Cip1 is a potent cyclindependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that functions as a
downstream effector of tumor suppressors including p53
and FOXO1 [32, 42]. Recent reports indicated crucial
roles of p21Cip1 not only in cell cycle regulation but also
in the maintenance of normal and cancer stem cells. In the
absence of p21Cip1, hematopoietic stem cell proliferation
and their absolute number were increased under normal
homeostatic conditions [43]. Therefore, p21Cip1 is regarded
as a molecular switch governing the entry of stem cells
into the cell cycle, and in its absence, increased cell
cycling leads to stem cell exhaustion. p21Cip1 has been
also shown to attenuate Ras- and c-Myc-dependent breast
tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem
cell gene expression in vivo [44]. Our current study also
uncovered that p21Cip1 plays a crucial role for cellular
senescence in iCSCL-10A cells there by leading to the
abrogation of their tumor-initiating properties. Moreover,
constitutive activation of mTOR and/or MEK signaling
also contributes to the geroconversion of iCSCL-10A cells
toward cellular senescence [28, 30].
Activation of the senescence program in cancer
cells is an attractive approach for the treatment of cancer
[45]. In fact, cellular senescence has been recognized as
a critical process in mammalian cells for the suppression

of tumorigenesis and malignant transformation [46]. It is
now clear that cellular senescence is a crucial anticancer
mechanism that prevents the growth of cells at risk for
neoplastic transformation into tumor initiating cells [47].
This crucial event can lead to the inhibition of metastatic
dissemination, therapeutic resistance and generation of
tumor cells with stem/progenitor cell properties [48, 49].
We clearly show here that WA promotes the senescence
of CSC-like cells and limits their tumorigenicity and
malignant characteristics. Indeed, only 48 hrs of WA
treatment was sufficient to induce senescence-like
morphological changes and SABG expression in iCSCL10A cells. WA treatment increased the levels of p21Cip1
in iCSCL-10A cells undergoing senescence. Targeted
depletion of endogenous p21Cip1 could block the WAinduced senescence. On the other hand, the ectopic
expression of p21Cip1 largely recapitulated the induction
of senescence and loss of CSC properties observed in
WA-treated iCSCL-10A cells. These results strongly
suggest that p21Cip1 plays a major role in inducing cellular
senescence leading to the abrogation of the malignant
nature in WA-treated CSCs.
WA suppressed the expression of EMT-related
transcription factors including Twist. Twist plays a role
in overcoming cellular senescence and in generating
tumorigenic cancer stem cells [50, 51]. Indeed, Twist
can abrogate oncogene-induced senescence and triggers
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Overexpression
of Twist was shown to completely abrogate p16Ink4a and
p21Cip1 induction in Ras-iuduced premature senescence
[52], suggesting that Twist is important for overriding
cellular senescence in cooperation with oncogenes [53]. In
our current study, WA strongly suppressed the expression
of Twist which was in line with its induction of p21Cip1.
EMT is a process that is closely associated with the

presentation depicting how Withaferin A (WA) can prevent CSC stemness and tumor progression. WA enhances p21Cip1 expression and
suppresses the expression of an EMT-related transcription factor Twist. This event initiates cellular senescence program in CSC-like cells.
In addition, the persistent activation of mitogenic pathways such as mTOR and/or MAPK/MEK may drive geroconversion from cell cycle
arrest to senescence. Consequently, WA can abrogate CSC properties including tumor-initiating ability.

acquisition of invasive properties in cancer progenitor or
pre-cancerous cells [54]. Our current findings highlight the
potential therapeutic benefits of WA treatment as a primary
safe-guard system against malignant transformation,
namely, the prevention of the EMT-mediated malignant
conversion of pre-cancerous cells into invasive cancer
stem-like cells via the activation of senescence program
[55].
Herein, we developed a simple, easy, cost-effective,
and highly reproducible assay system that is applicable
to large-scale drug screenings. Our optimized drug
screen for CSC differentiation and stemness provides
excellent consistency and reproducibility for the complex
biological process of CSCs. Furthermore, this drug
screen can be applied to a larger number of compounds
to determine more selective and effective inhibitors of
CSCs. This current approach holds great promise for
future development of novel drugs to eliminate CSC and
hopefully provide a complete cure for tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Tumor sphere formation assay
Cell culture

Cells were seeded in 96-well ultra low-attachment
surface plates (Corning) at a density of 5x103 cells/well
and cultured in serum-free DMEM-Ham’s F12 nutrient
mixture (1:1, v/v) supplemented with 5 mg/mL insulin, 0.5
mg/mL hydrocortisone, 2% B27, and epidermal growth
factor (20 ng/ml).

iCSCL-10A cells were generated and maintained
as described previously [22]. Cells were cultured
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin.

Cell invasion assay

Chemicals
Phytochemical compounds library used in this study
were purchased from TOKIWA PYTOCHEMICAL Co.,
Ltd (Chiba, Japan). Chemicals were diluted in DMSO to
10 mM without further purification.

Cell invasion assays were performed using 24well transwell inserts coated with 1 mg/ml matrigel (BD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Invasive cells in the lower
chamber were counted and scored in triplicate as described
previously [22].

Alkaline Phosphatase assay

Wound healing assay

iCSCL-10A cells (5x103 cells/well) were plated in
100 ml/well in 96-well plates. After 24 hrs, 1 mM of each
compound was added to the appropriate wells. Alkaline
Phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured after 48 hrs
using the TRACP & ALP Assay Kit (TaKaRa, Shiga,
Japan). For microscopic examination, cells were stained
using the VECTOR Red Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate
Kit (VECTOR Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Cells were grown as a monolayer and a wound was
made along the central axis of the plate using a pipette
tip. The migration of cells into the wound was observed
after 6 hrs in six randomly selected microscopic fields
[56]. Wound closures were quantified using the image
processing and analysis software program Image J 1.40g.
