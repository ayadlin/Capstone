Inhibition of Tumor Cell Migration by LD22-4, an N-Terminal
Fragment of 24-kDa FGF2, Is Mediated by Neuropilin 1
Ling Zhang1, Graham C. Parry2, and Eugene G. Levin1,2

Abstract
LD22-4, an 86-amino acid fragment of the basic ﬁbroblast growth factor, is an inhibitor of cell migration. LD22-4
inhibits the migration of various tumor cells, endothelial cells, and ﬁbroblasts in vitro and suppresses tumor
growth and angiogenesis in vivo. LD22-4 is effective in the presence of multiple growth factors, either alone or in
combination, as well as haptotactic factors. LD22-4 inhibits the rate of malignant gliomas prepared from U87MG
cells in an orthotopic mouse model by 90% compared with untreated mice. Using U87MG cells, we identiﬁed the
LD22-4 membrane receptor as neuropilin 1 (NRP1). The identiﬁcation of NRP1 as the LD22-4 receptor was based
upon mass spectrometric analysis of proteins that bind to LD22-4, immunoprecipitation of an NRP1–LD22-4
complex formed during incubation of LD22-4 with U87MG cells, LD22-4-NRP1 coimmunoprecipitation studies,
and binding of LD22-4 to HEK293 cells expressing NRP1. In contrast, NRP1 binding of an inactive mutant of LD224 was substantially reduced. As is typical of NRP1-binding proteins, LD22-4 itself binds to heparin and requires
heparan sulfate for binding to cells. The addition of heparin to migration assays increased the inhibitory activity of
LD22-4. In addition to a heparin-binding region, LD22-4 contains a 5-amino acid C-terminus that matches an
NRP1 consensus binding sequence. Thus, direct binding experiments, dependence on heparan sulfate, and the
presence of a NRP1 consensus binding sequence indicate that NRP1 is the binding site of LD22-4 and mediates
inhibition of cell migration. Cancer Res; 73(11); 3316–25. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
LD22-4 (previously referred to as ATEþ31), an 86-amino
acid N-terminal fragment of the basic ﬁbroblast growth factor
(bFGF2), is an inhibitor of cell migration (1, 2). LD22-4 inhibits
the migration of tumor cells, endothelial cells, and ﬁbroblasts
in vitro and is effective in the presence of various growth factors
that promote enhanced migration [VEGF, insulin-like growth
factor (IGF), EGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)],
complex mixtures of growth factors and cytokines (serum),
as well as haptotactic factors (ﬁbronectin). LD22-4 suppresses
tumor growth and angiogenesis by more than 90% in animal
models using breast, prostate, and lung carcinoma-derived
tumors (1, 2). LD22-4 is not cytotoxic, does not induce apoptosis, and does not have a signiﬁcant effect on proliferation
rates of endothelial cells and tumor cells. LD22-4 has a highly
basic N-terminal domain containing 3 clusters of 3 arginines
each, and arginine to alanine substitution in the amino terminal 2 clusters diminishes LD22-4 activity. Mechanistically,
LD22-4 blocks focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation in
response to growth factors, speciﬁcally the phosphorylation of
Tyr407-FAK and Ser732-FAK (3). FAK-tyr407 is required to recruit

paxillin and vinculin to FAK and to ensure formation of focal
adhesions (4). LD22-4 does not affect the phosphorylation of
FAK-tyr861, tyr925, tyr577, or tyr397 nor the phosphorylation of
PYK2, src kinases, Erk1/2, or AKT following growth factor
treatment (3–5). Thus, LD22-4 seems to target a highly speciﬁc
phosphorylation event necessary for cell migration. The failure
of growth factors to phosphorylate FAK-tyr407 in the presence
of LD22-4 occurs simultaneously with the failure of FAK, focal
adhesion plaques, and actin stress ﬁbers to redistribute within
the cell cytoplasm and periphery, suggesting that LD22-4
causes a systemic failure in the mechanisms promoting cell
migration (3).
Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein with multiple ligands (6–8). The primary role of NRP1 is
the regulation of cell motility, particularly with respect to
neural and vascular development (7–12). NRP1 forms a coreceptor complex with VEGFR2 through the bridging of the 2
receptors by VEGF (6, 9, 13–16). NRP1–VEGF–VEGFR2 complex formation leads to enhanced VEGFR2 activation, actin
reorganization, and the stimulation of cell migration, and
blocking VEGF binding to NRP1 diminishes the rate of cell
migration although it has no effect on cell growth (9, 17). Thus,
NRP1 has been associated with the VEGF-dependent stimulation of cell migration. Blocking VEGF binding to NRP1 does
not affect VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 or Akt,
indicating that NRP1 is not required for the activation of all of
the VEGF signaling pathways and that some occur exclusively
through VEGFR–VEGF interaction (17). In addition to VEGF,
NRP1 also interacts with other growth factors including
bFGF2, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/SF), PDGF, and

placental growth factor (PlGF; refs. 10, 18–22). The NRP1binding sites for bFGF2 and HGF are distinct from that of
VEGF; an antibody that blocks VEGF binding to NRP1 and
does not interfere with cell migration promoted by FGF2 or
HGF (22). NRP1 is also required for p130cas phosphorylation
in response to HGF and PDGF in malignant glioma cells
(10).
NRP1 is expressed by human tumor cell lines and tumor cells
derived from lung, breast, prostate, pancreatic, and colon
carcinomas, but is not found in the corresponding normal
tissues (7, 17, 23–26). Clinical studies suggest that NRP1 plays a
role in tumor growth and disease progression. It is preferentially expressed in metastatic cells, and is associated with
invasive behavior and metastatic potential. Overexpression of
NRP1 in prostate and colon cancer cells enhances angiogenesis
and tumor growth in animals. We present here evidence that
NRP1 acts as the receptor for LD22-4, and that the binding
characteristics and subsequent effects are consistent with
those deﬁned for protein–NRP1 interaction.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
U87MG and HEK293 cell lines were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection and cultured according to
the supplier's instructions. U87MG cells expressing luciferase
(U87MG-luc) were provided by Dr. Patrick McConville (Molecular Imaging, Inc.). The cell lines used in this study have not
been tested or authenticated.
Puriﬁcation and biotinylation of LD22-4
LD22-4 was prepared as described previously (2). Biotinylation of LD22-4 was carried out with 0.8 mg/mL LD22-4
in the presence of 5 mmol/L Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (EZ-Link
Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin; Pierce) with PBS for 1 hour at room
temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of
100 mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, and the reaction mixture was
dialyzed against PBS. LD63-6, a functionally deﬁcient
mutant of LD22-4 in which the arginines within the ﬁrst
22 amino acids are converted to alanines, was prepared and
biotinylated in the same way. Both LD22-4 and LD63-6 were
generated with a His-tag inserted at the C-terminal end to
allow for immunodetection with equal avidity.
Migration assay
Cell migration assays were conducted using modiﬁed Boyden chambers with a 6.5-mm diameter and a 8.0 mm pore size
polycarbonate membrane separating the 2 chambers (Nalge
Nunc International) as described previously (1). Both sides of
the membrane were coated with vitronectin at 1 mg/mL for
2 hours at room temperature. The results were expressed as
a percentage of the number of cells migrating in the presence
of PDGF alone  SD. All experiments were conducted in
triplicate.
Binding experiments
U87MG cells (5  104 cells) were plated on glass coverslips
(18 mm) coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma) incubated with 2.5
mmol/L biotinylated LD22-4 or biotinylated LD63-6 in PBS,

ﬁxed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and incubated with
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–streptavidin.
Fractionation of U87MG plasma membrane and
isolation of LD22-4–binding proteins
U87MG glioma cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization, and centrifuged at 800 g for 20 minutes to remove the
nuclear fraction. The remaining cell lysates underwent centrifugation at 45,000  g for 20 minutes at 4 C, and the pellet
was resuspended in 1 mL of lysis buffer containing 1% octyl
glucoside (OG) for 2 hours at 4 C. The remaining insoluble
material was removed by centrifugation at 45,000  g for 20
minutes at 4 C. To isolate LD22-4–binding proteins, LD22-4 or
LD63-6-Sepharose was incubated with 100 mL U87MG membrane extract for 2 hours at 4 C. The Sepharose–protein
complex was removed from the reaction mixture by centrifugation, and treated with 5 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol and
mass spectroscopy (MS)-grade trypsin (Invitrogen) overnight
at 37 C. Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation and
the digest was analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) on an LTQ Mass Spectrometer at The Scripps Research Institute Center for Mass
Spectrometry. The raw data were screened using the MASCOT
NCBInr Homo Sapiens database.
Generation of HEK293 cells expressing NRP1
HEK293 cells were transfected with a plasmid consisting of
the full-length human NRP1 cDNA in a pENTR221 mammalian
expression vector (GeneCopoeia, Inc).
LD22-4-NRP1 coimmunoprecipitation analysis
Binding of LD22-4 to NRP1 was analyzed by 3 methods: (i)
U87MG cells were treated with 2.5 mmol/L LD22-4 or LD63-6
for 10 minutes at 37 C, washed with cold PBS twice, and lysed
with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% OG plus protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein were treated
with anti-neuropilin-1 antibody overnight at 4 C, the immune
complexes were precipitated with protein A/G agarose (Calbiochem), and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting with biotinylated anti-His antibody; (ii) Cell
membrane extracts were prepared and 2.5 mmol/L LD22-4Sepharose or LD63-6-Sepharose was incubated with 100 mL
U87MG membrane extract for 4 hours at 4 C. The complexes
were removed by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotting with a-NRP1 antibodies; (iii) U87MG cell
membrane extracts were prepared and 100 mL incubated with
a-NRP1-agarose conjugates overnight at 4 C. The NRP1a-NRP1-agarose was incubated with 2.5 mmol/L LD22-4 or
LD63-6 for 4 hours at 4 C. Complexes were precipitated by
centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a-His and a-NRP1 antibodies.
In vivo analysis of LD22-4 activity
All experiments were conducted with 6- to 7-week-old CD-1
nu/nu female mice. All procedures carried out in this experiment were conducted in compliance with all the laws, regulations, and guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
and with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use

Little difference in the inhibitory activity between biotinylated
LD22-4 and unlabeled LD22-4 was observed (Fig. 1C).
The effect of LD22-4 on the growth of malignant gliomas was
tested in an orthotopic mouse model. Animals were treated
with 0, 0.44 (17.6 mg/kg), or 4.4 mg (176 mg/kg) LD22-4 (Fig. 2A)
and tumor growth was measured by BLI every 7 days (arrows).
In all 3 cohorts, tumor growth remained static for 20 days
followed by a comparable increase from 20 to 27 days (Fig. 2A).
Tumor size continued to increase in the untreated and 0.44 mg
LD22-4–treated animals, but animals treated with 4.4 mg LD224 showed no further increase in mean BLI intensity; at day 35,
the average tumor size in these animals was only 21  4% that
of the control group (P ¼ 0.016). Tumors in the group treated
with 0.44 mg were 65  16% that of the untreated group
although this decrease was not statistically signiﬁcant (P ¼
0.29). The group medians were 13% and 84% of the control
group in the animals treated with 4.4 and 0.44 mg LD22-4,
respectively (Fig. 2B). The experiment was repeated with 4.4 mg
LD22-4 and similar results were observed (Fig. 2C); at day 35,

Committee. Each animal underwent surgery for implantation
of a stainless steel cannula (13-mm long and 0.635 mm in
diameter) 3 mm into the right frontal brain. Animals were
allowed to recover from surgery for 1 week before tumor cell
inoculation. Mice were treated with 0, 0.44, or 4.4 mg LD22-4
every 4 days and bioluminescence imaging (BLI)was carried
out every 7 days.

Results
Inhibition of glioma migration and tumor growth by
LD22-4
LD22-4 inhibited U87MG cell migration in a dose-dependent
manner with maximum inhibition (26.2  8.5% residual activity) occurring at 2.5 mmol/L (Fig. 1A). No further inhibition
occurred at higher concentrations of LD22-4. This maximum
inhibition is consistent with that observed with all cell types
and chemoattractants in previous studies (1–3). LD 63-6, the
LD22-4 mutant containing arginine to alanine substitutions in
the N-terminus (1), was less effective in inhibiting cell migration than LD22-4, reducing migration by only 20% (to 80.3 

deaths occurred during the study, and changes in the weights
of control and LD22-4–treated animals were similar (data
not shown). Histologic analysis of the brains at day 35
conﬁrmed the BLI results (Fig. 2D); 4.4-mg LD22-4–treated
animals showed only traces of residual tumor (circled area)
compared with the large tumors present in the brains of

LD22-4 binding to U87MG cells
U87MG cells were incubated with 2.5 mmol/L biotinylated
LD22-4 in the presence or absence of unlabeled LD22-4 (Fig. 3).
LD22-4 was uniformly distributed throughout the cell surface
(Fig. 3A). To verify that binding was speciﬁc, unlabeled LD22-4
at a 20- (Fig. 3B) and 60-fold (Fig. 3C) molar excess was
included in the binding solution. A 20-fold excess of unlabeled

LD22-4 signiﬁcantly reduced ﬂuorescence intensity, whereas
little detectable ﬂuorescence remained at 60-fold excess. In
contrast, binding of LD63-6 was signiﬁcantly reduced, but not
completely eliminated (Fig. 3D, control; 3E, LD63-6). No binding was observed with trypsin-treated biotinylated LD22-4
indicating that the positive signals were not due to the biotinylation of cell surface molecules by residual biotin reagents
(data not shown).
Identiﬁcation of the LD22-4–binding protein
Isolation of an LD22-4 cell surface-binding protein was
carried out by subjecting U87MG cell membrane extracts to
afﬁnity chromatography on LD22-4-Sepharose and LD63-6Sepharose, digestion of bound proteins trypsinization, and the
digest analyzed by MS-based proteomics. Among the proteins
binding speciﬁcally to LD22-4, only 1 was identiﬁed as a known
surface receptor with a transmembrane sequence and a

biologic role in the regulation of cell migration, NRP1. Table 1
lists the peptides corresponding to NRP1 that were obtained
when the LD22-4-binding proteins were subjected to MS.
Conﬁrmation that LD22-4 speciﬁcally bound to NRP1 was
obtained with HEK293 cells expressing human NRP1 (HEK293NRP1; Fig. 4). Expression of NRP1 by the HEK293-transfected
cells was validated by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis of cells transfected with the NRP1 gene (Fig.
4B, a-NRP1). For LD22-4-binding studies, 0, 100, and 1,000
nmol/L biotinylated LD22-4 were incubated with HEK293 or
HEK293-NRP1; no binding of LD22-4 was observed at 100
nmol/L, whereas 1,000 nmol/L LD22-4 caused a shift in ﬂuorescence, showing that the presence of NRP1 on the cell surface
promotes LD22-4 binding. Binding of LD22-4 to HEK293-NRP1
but not HEK293 parental cells was also shown by immunohistochemical analysis and ﬂuorescent microscopy (Fig. 4A).
Further evidence that LD22-4 binds to NRP1 was sought by
coimmunoprecipitation experiments using U87MG membrane
NRP1. Three approaches were taken: (i) LD22-4-Sepharose or
LD63-6-Sepharose was incubated with U87MG cell membrane
extracts, and the presence of NRP1 was evaluated by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). NRP1 in crude membrane extracts
appeared as a doublet with an top band representing a
molecular weight of 130 kDa, the deﬁned molecular weight
of NRP1, and a lower band of approximately 110 kDa. NRP1 has
also been observed as a doublet in extracts of U87MG cells,

smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and tissue removed
from glioma tumors in previous studies (10, 19, 27). No
explanation of the source of the lower band has been presented, and it is unclear whether it is the result of proteolytic
cleavage or regulated transcriptional or translational modiﬁcation. Immunoblot analysis of LD22-4- and LD63-6-Sepharose-binding proteins showed NRP1 had associated with both,
although a much smaller amount was observed in samples
containing LD63-6-Sepharose (Fig. 5A). However, only the top
NRP1 band of the doublet was observed in both samples. As it is
not clear whether the difference in molecular weight is due to
protein size or posttranslational modiﬁcation, the apparent
difference in afﬁnity cannot be explained. (ii) Formation of an
NRP1-LD22-4 complex was evaluated by isolating NRP1 from
U87MG membrane extracts with a-NRP1-agarose and then
incubating the immune complex with LD22-4 or LD63-6 (Fig.
5B). Immunoblot analysis of the resulting agarose-aNRP1–
associated proteins revealed the presence of LD22-4. LD63-6
was also detected, but at lower levels than LD22-4. To ensure
that the bound NRP1 was presented to LD22-4 and LD63-6 in
equal amounts, aliquots of agarose-aNRP1 were removed after
incubation with the membrane extracts and the relative
amount of NRP1 was determined. The results showed little
difference in the amount of NRP1 available to LD22-4 and
LD63-6 (Fig. 5B, right). (iii) Direct cell surface binding experiments were conducted by incubating LD22-4 or LD63-6 with

LD22-4 binds heparin
Heparin plays a crucial role in the interaction between NRP1
and its binding proteins. VEGF, FGF2, PDGF, and HTLV all
bind to heparin and removal of heparan sulfates from the cell
surface limit the binding of the proteins to NRP1 (21, 22, 28, 29).
To determine whether LD22-4 has an afﬁnity for heparin,

binding experiments were conducted with LD22-4 and heparin–agarose (Fig. 6). Under physiologic salt concentrations,
LD22-4 bound to heparin–agarose and was only partially
eluted with 350 mmol/L NaCl. Complete elution of the protein
from heparin required 500 mmol/L NaCl (Fig. 6A). Elution of
LD22-4 from the heparin–agarose could also be achieved with
free heparin with 50% removal at 125 mg/mL heparin and
complete removal at 625 mg/mL. (Fig. 6B, left). Little binding of
LD63-6 to heparin was observed (Fig. 6B, right), suggesting that
the arginine-rich N-terminus of LD22-4 is required for heparin
binding. Heparinase treatment before addition of the protein

resulted in a decline in LD22-4 binding, which was not further
reduced with additional lyase. To determine whether cell
surface heparan sulfate was required for LD22-4 binding to
U87MG cells, cells were treated with heparitinase I (Fig. 6C and

Immunologic detection showed that heparan sulfate could not
be detected on the cell surface following digestion (Fig. 6E).
Finally, to metabolically block the sulfation of GAGs, cells were

treatment was 85  6%.
The functional effect of heparin on LD22-4 activity was
assessed by treating glioma cells with LD22-4 in the presence
or absence of 10 mg/mL heparin (Fig. 6G). Heparin itself at a
concentration of up to 625 mg/mL had no effect on U87MG cell
migration (data not shown). However, when cells were treated
with 2.5 mmol/L LD22-4 and 10 mg/mL heparin, the rate of cell
migration declined from 17.5 þ 6.6% to 6.6 þ 4.3% of untreated
cultures.

Discussion
In this report, we identify NRP1, a growth factor coreceptor linked to the control of cell migration, as a cell
surface binding site for LD22-4. This conclusion is supported
by MS analysis of proteins that bind to LD22-4, immunoprecipitation of an NRP1–LD22-4 complex formed during
incubation of U87MG cells with LD22-4, coimmunoprecipitation of the 2 proteins, and binding of LD22-4 to HEK293
cells expressing NRP1.
There are several characteristics of LD22-4 that are consistent with a protein that binds to NRP1. One of the most striking
is the C-terminal sequence of LD22-4. Studies using phage
display screens to identify a class of peptides that induce cell
binding and internalization showed that those with the greatest binding afﬁnity had a terminal consensus R/KXXR/K
sequence (30). Most efﬁcient were peptides with a C-terminal
arginine residue preceded by an arginine or lysine. Optimum
binding afﬁnity occurred when 2 non-basic amino acids separated the R/K at either end of the consensus sequence. For
example, a peptide containing the sequence TKPPR (enhanced
tuftsin) binds to endothelial cells approximately 20-fold more
avidly than the peptide TKPR (tuftsin; ref. 31). NRP1 was
identiﬁed as the receptor for the peptides containing this motif.
VEGF165 interacts with NRP-1 through a C-terminal consensus-like sequence (CRCDKPRR) and tuftsin, enhanced tuftsin,
and A7R (ATWLPPR), compete with VEGF165 for NRP-1 binding (31–33). This occurred in tumor cell lines, vascular endothelial cells, and in cells isolated from normal mouse organ. In
addition, this consensus sequence is found within the HTLV
surface unit, and is required for virus binding to NRP1. The Cterminus of LD22-4, KDPKR, is identical to the consensus
binding sequence deﬁned by this class of NRP1 binding proteins. Thus, it is likely that LD22-4 is 1 of a class of proteins that
binds to NRP1 through this speciﬁc sequence. In fact, deletion
mutagenesis studies showed that the absence of the C-terminal
11 amino acids of LD22-4 (which includes the KDPKR
sequence) reduced the inhibition of cell migration by half.
Therefore, we propose that maximum binding of LD22-4 to
NRP1 is dependent on both the C-terminal sequence and the
heparin-binding region.
Heparin binding to growth factors and NRP1 itself is an
essential part of NRP1 interaction, dimerization, and signal
transduction (6, 21, 22, 32, 34). Both VEGF165 and NRP1 bind
heparin and heparan sulfate that enhance the interaction
between the 2 proteins by 100-fold. LD22-4–heparin-binding
studies show that the protein has an afﬁnity for heparin that
withstands salt concentrations greater than physiologic

www.aacrjournals.org

levels, and requires an excess of heparin for dissociation.
The reduction of LD22-4 binding following heparinase digestion of the cell surface and the increased inhibition of
migration in the presence of added heparin indicates that
LD22-4-heparin binding has a functional consequence leading to increased LD22-4 activity. Heparan sulfates on the cell
surface also seem to play some role in LD22-4 binding
because enzymatic digestion by heparitinase reduces
LD22-4 binding. The apparent difference in binding of
LD22-4 following digestion with each lyase is probably due
to differing requirements for the speciﬁc GAGs affected by
the enzymes. In both cases of GAG degradation, LD22-4
binding is not completely eliminated, suggesting that there
are multiple factors required for optimum binding. The
NRP1 C-terminal consensus binding sequence is a likely
candidate for a secondary binding site that acts in concert
with the GAGs.
The arginine rich N-terminal sequence on LD22-4 is
consistent with a heparin-binding site. The consensus sites
in many glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins have been
deﬁned as arrays of basic amino acid clusters (arginine,
lysine, and/or histidine) with arginine-containing peptides
having the greatest afﬁnity for heparin. The most commonly
observed spacing pattern is a single non-basic amino acid
between basic amino acid clusters (35). The LD22-4 Nterminus contains 3 regions of 3 arginines apiece with each
arginine separated by a glycine. The failure of the mutant
(LD63-6) to bind heparin and its reduced inhibitory activity
suggests that the arginine-rich region of LD22-4 is responsible for heparin binding and is associated with maximum
inhibition of migration.
The mechanism by which LD22-4 blocks cell migration
through NRP1 binding remains to be elucidated. Simple competition for growth factor binding to NRP1 would involve
LD22-4 blocking the interaction of multiple growth factors,
which do not bind to the same locus on NRP1. In addition,
neither IGF-I nor ﬁbronectin have been found to bind to NRP1.
An alternative to directly interfering with growth factor binding is blocking the transmission of signals that promote
migration. Proteins involved in the formation of signaling
receptor complexes are often single transmembrane domain
proteins that form homo- or heterodimers and oligomeric
complexes that are crucial for signal transduction (36–38).
NRP1 ﬁts this description and has a putative dimerization
motif found in the transmembrane domain (39, 40). If NRP1
signaling is dependent on the formation of NRP1 dimers or
oligomers as this model predicts, then LD22-4 could disrupt
NRP1 function by interfering with NRP1 dimerization or its
interaction with other membrane receptors. Finally, the interaction between LD22-4 and NRP1 may directly interfere with
signal transduction by suppressing the association of NRP1
with cytoplasmic proteins that initiate intracellular signaling
pathways. There are also studies that suggest that NRP1does
not necessarily function solely as a coreceptor, but can signal
independently of growth factor receptor interaction through
NRP1 cytoplasmic domain interaction with nonreceptor intracellular proteins (8, 10, 16, 41, 42). Deletion mutagenesis studies
show that the 3 amino acids in the C-terminal, serine–glutamic

acid–alanine, are essential for NRP-1–mediated HUVEC
migration and that this involves the RGS–GAIP-interacting
protein that binds to NRP1 through the SEA-COOH motif
(16, 43). Thus, another mechanism by which LD22-4 may
inhibit migration is through interference or disruption of
interaction between the NRP1-cytoplasmic domain and
intracellular proteins.
Taken together, the data presented in this study are consistent with NRP1 acting as the cell surface receptor for LD22-4.
The fact that NRP1 regulates cell migration is also consistent
with it being the target of a protein such as LD22-4 that acts as
an inhibitor of cell motility. The efﬁcacy of LD22-4 in the
presence of various growth factors and the identiﬁcation of
NRP1 as the target for LD22-4–cell interaction suggest that
there is a binding site on NRP1 for LD22-4 that can be exploited
to inhibit cell migration regardless of its stimulus. Identiﬁcation of the precise binding site on NRP1 and the mechanism
by which it effects migration will allow for development of
more efﬁcacious compounds to control tumor growth and
angiogenesis.
