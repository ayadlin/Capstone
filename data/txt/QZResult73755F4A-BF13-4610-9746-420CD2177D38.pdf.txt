ABSTRACT
The novel, chemically stabilized disorazole analog, (-)-CP2-disorazole C1 (1)
displayed potent anti-proliferative activity against a broad-spectrum of human
colorectal cancer cells. HCT15 and H630R1 cell lines expressing high basal levels
of the ABCB1 protein, known to cause multi-drug resistance, were also sensitive
to growth inhibition by 1 but were resistant to both vincristine and docetaxel, two
commonly used microtubule inhibitors. Compound 1 exhibited strong inhibition of
tubulin polymerization at a level comparable to vincristine. In addition, treatment with
1 resulted in decreased protein levels of β-tubulin but not α-tubulin. An analysis of
cellular proteins known to interact with microtubules showed that 1 caused decreased
expression of c-Myc, APC, Rb, and additional key cellular signaling pathways in CRC
cells. Treatment with compound 1 also resulted in G2/M cell cycle arrest and induction
of apoptosis, but not senescence. Furthermore, endothelial spheroid sprouting assays
demonstrated that 1 suppressed angiogenesis and can, therefore, potentially prevent
cancer cells from spreading and metastasizing. Taken together, these findings suggest
that the microtubule disruptor 1 may be a potential drug candidate for the treatment
of mCRC.

and in the sea is emerging. In addition to biosynthetic
approaches and the manipulation of gene clusters [5, 6],
the synthesis of novel natural product-like compounds
offers interesting new opportunities to augment traditional
natural product extract collections [7–9]. An alternative
discovery strategy involves the structural modification
of natural products with the goals of enhancing physicochemical properties and target selectivity, while reducing
complexity and facilitating scale-up. However, this
approach is often limited by narrow structure-activity
relationships and significant reductions in potency for
even slightly modified structural variants [10–12].

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 30% of all anticancer drugs used
globally are derived from plant and/or animal sources.
In spite of a recent focus in the pharmaceutical industry
on biological agents as well as chemical lead structures
identified in screens of large heterocyclic compound
libraries, natural products continue to play a significant
role as a potential source of antitumor agents [1–4]. Since
the isolation of novel lead compounds has become more
time- and resource-intensive, a critical need to develop
alternative strategies to traditional prospecting on land

The disorazoles comprise a group of approximately
30 structurally closely related polyene macrodiolides, first
isolated from the mycobacterium Sorangium cellulosum
in 1994 [13–15]. A major fermentation product, disorazole
A1, blocked cancer cell proliferation at picomolar
concentrations and inhibited in vitro polymerization of
tubulin. Since the highly electrophilic divinyl oxirane
moiety of A1 is not considered to be a pharmacologically
desirable drug-like moiety, we selected a minor
fermentation component, disorazole C1, which lacked the
reactive epoxide component, as a higher priority target for
chemical synthesis [16]. Subsequent biological studies
indicated that the vinyl oxirane moiety was not critical
for antiproliferative activity as disorazole C1 maintained
low nanomolar anticancer properties, which were also
correlated with microtubule destabilization [17–20].
Furthermore, our group recently succeeded in the synthesis
of a bis-cyclopropyl analog of disorazole C1, (-)-CP2disorazole C1 (1), that retained low-nanomolar biological
activity similar to what was observed with the parent
compound (Figure 1) [21]. We speculated that replacement
of the central (Z)-alkene in the (Z,Z,E)-triene subunit of
disorazole C1 with a cyclopropane moiety would generate
an even more chemically stable analog with minimal
perturbation of the conformation of the macrocycle that
was still capable of engaging the biological target [22, 23].
Herein, we conducted a series of experiments to further
evaluate the biological effects and potential mechanism of
action of (-)-CP2-disorazole C1 (1) in human colon cancer
cells.

in both p53+/+ and p53-/- HCT116 cells, suggesting that
the cytotoxic effect of this disorazole analog was mediated
through p53-independent pathways. This phenomenon has
been demonstrated previously for agents that destabilize
microtubules [24, 25]. HCT116 p21-/- cells, which are
p21 deleted, were slightly more sensitive to growth
inhibition with 1, but this effect was not statistically
significant. Interestingly, HCT15 and H630R1 cells
were both sensitive to growth inhibition by 1, but were
significantly more resistant to vincristine and docetaxel,
two anti-microtubule inhibitor agents that are commonly
used in clinical practice to treat a broad range of human
cancers. An immunoblot analysis revealed that these two
cell lines expressed relatively high basal levels of the
ABCB1 protein (Supplementary Figure S1), which is
known to mediate multi-drug resistance. In contrast, RKO
and HCT116 cells had undetectable levels of ABCB1.
Increased expression of ABCB1 has been identified as
a resistance mechanism to disorazoles C1 and A1 as well
as to the vinca alkaloids and paclitaxel [17, 26–28]. This
result suggests that the structural modifications to 1 may
have overcome this potential resistance mechanism. We
observed no detectable levels of ABCG2 protein in the
human CRC cell lines. Other ABC-related genes such as
ABCC1 were not investigated given that cells remained
sensitive to 1. Of note, we were unable to determine an IC50
value for 1 in normal colon epithelial 841 and FHC cells
suggesting that this analog does not have cytotoxic effects
against normal cells and that it displays an expanded
therapeutic window. However, these normal cells were
also resistant to vincristine- and docetaxel-mediated
growth inhibition. To determine whether 1 could inhibit
the ability of CRC cells to repopulate from single cells, we
tested the effects of 1 on colony formation. As shown in
Table 2, 1 effectively inhibited clonogenic growth in all the
CRC cell lines tested. The ABCB1-overexpressing cells
lines, while still sensitive to 1, had IC50 values significantly
higher than the ABCB1-negative cell lines.

RESULTS
Anti-proliferative activity of (-)-CP2-disorazole
C1 (1) against a broad spectrum of human
colorectal cancer cells
We previously showed that 1 had significant antiproliferative activity against human colon cancer RKO,
HCT116, and H630 cells. In contrast, the cyclic monomer
2 had no inhibitory effect on cell growth at concentrations
up to 1,000-fold higher [21]. In the present study, we
further investigated the growth inhibitory effect of 1
in various human CRC cell lines with different genetic
backgrounds. As shown in Table 1, IC50 values for 1
ranged from 4 to 26 nM. Growth inhibition was similar

Compound 1 inhibited tubulin polymerization
To investigate the direct interaction between
tubulin and the disorazole analog 1, a cell-free tubulin
polymerization assay was used. Tubulin polymerization
was monitored by the incorporation of a fluorescent
marker into microtubules. As recombinant tubulin protein

Effect of compound 1 on expression of tubulin
and its subtypes
Microtubules are heterodimers composed of
combinations of eight α- and seven β-tubulin isotypes
[2, 29]. Class I and IV have been identified as the major
β-tubulin isotypes present in colon tumors and colon
cancer cell lines with minor expression of class III and V
[30, 31]. Using isotype-specific antibodies, we were able
to detect class I, III, and IV β-tubulin proteins in human
CRC cells (Figure 4A). These isotypes were expressed at
similar levels in all cell lines except for class III, which
was highly expressed in HCT116 cells. At the mRNA level,
the class I isotype comprised the majority of β-tubulin
mRNA with class III and class IV expressed at 100-fold
and 1,000-fold lower levels, respectively (Figure 4B). We
then evaluated the expression level of these isotypes after
treatment with 1. Exposure of CRC cell lines to 1 for 24 h
resulted in decreased levels of total β-tubulin protein but
not α-tubulin (Figure 4C). The inactive cyclic monomer 2,
used as a control compound to highlight the specificity of
1, had no effect on β-tubulin expression (Supplementary
Figure S2). Treatment with 1 resulted in decreased
expression of β-I tubulin protein in RKO, HCT15, and
H630R1 cells. Isotype β-III tubulin was decreased only
in RKO cells, while β-IV tubulin was decreased in RKO
and HCT15 cells. Exposure to 1 had a differential effect on
tubulin mRNA expression as β-I tubulin mRNA decreased
significantly while there was a paradoxical increase in
β-III tubulin mRNA expression (Figure 4D). We next
determined the time-dependent effect of 1 on β-tubulin

polymerized, it showed a pattern of nucleation, growth,
and eventual steady-state equilibrium (Figure 2). In the
presence of docetaxel, a microtubule stabilizing molecule
[1], the nucleation period was vastly decreased, the growth
rate faster, and the final polymer mass was greater. In the
case of the microtubule disrupting agent, vincristine,
there was a decrease in the growth rate and a significant
reduction in the final polymer mass. Compound 1
exhibited inhibition of microtubule formation in a manner
comparable to vincristine, suggesting that 1 possesses
strong anti-tubulin polymerization activity. In contrast,
the inactive disorazole analog 2 had absolutely no effect
on tubulin polymerization.
We next investigated the effect of 1 on tubulin
organization in intact cells and the microtubule structure of
cells was visualized via immunocytochemistry. As shown
in Figure 3, both α-tubulin and β-tubulin microtubules
formed an intact network of tubules extending into the
lamellipodium in untreated cells. Treatment of H630 and
H630R1 cells with 1 resulted in significant disruption

expression. After 4 h, total β-tubulin expression decreased
significantly in H630 cells but not in H630R1 cells (Figures
5A, 5B). However, by 8 h, tubulin expression was similarly
suppressed in H630R1 cells. Levels of β-I tubulin and β-IV
tubulin decreased rapidly and remained suppressed for 24
h. Of note, expression of β-III tubulin decreased initially
but returned to baseline levels by 24 h. This finding
coincides with the observed induction of β-III tubulin
mRNA (Figure 4D). To investigate the mechanism by
which tubulin levels were decreased, expression of tubulin
was determined in the presence of the protein synthesis
inhibitor cycloheximide. As shown in Figure 6, treatment
with 1 resulted in a rapid decrease in β-tubulin expression.
However, after 12 h, no further decrease was observed
suggesting that compound 1 did not alter the stability of
tubulin after the initial loss of protein.

disorazole C1 analog can potentially suppress the ability of
cells to invade and metastasize.

Effects of compound 1 on microtubule-related
proteins
A large number of cellular proteins are known to
associate with microtubules [29, 32]. We next determined
whether the decrease in β-tubulin expression resulting
from treatment with 1 was associated with altered
expression of these microtubule-associated proteins. The
c-Myc transcription factor has been shown to interact and
bind α-tubulin [33]. Exposure to compound 1 resulted
in significant reduction in c-Myc protein expression in
all cell lines (Figure 8). The Adenomatous Polyposis
Coli (APC) tumor suppressor is also known to bind
microtubules and β-catenin. Treatment with 1 resulted
in decreased expression of the truncated mutant form of
APC in HCT15, H630, and H630R1 cells. We were unable
to detect full-length APC in RKO and HCT116 cells. We
observed significant reduction in p-ERK signaling in
all cell lines with total ERK remaining unchanged. The
effects of 1 on other microtubule-interacting proteins were
cell-line specific. Expression of cyclin D1 decreased in
RKO, HCT15, and H630 cells, while it was increased in
HCT116 and H630R1 cells. We observed that expression
of the heat shock protein HSP27 decreased in RKO and
HCT15 cells, remained unchanged in HCT116 cells,
and was undetectable in H630 and H630R1 cells. The
retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb), like c-Myc, was

Effect of compound 1 on migration
In addition to regulating cell proliferation,
microtubules play a key role in cell migration. With this
in mind, in vitro endothelial spheroid sprouting assays
were performed to test the effect of 1 on the angiogenesis
of the microvascular endothelial cells. After spheroid
formation and embedding into collagen gel, the spheroids
were treated with compound 1 for 24 h. In the untreated
spheroids, sprouts grew out around the spheroid at the
frequency of 24 sprouts/spheroid (Figure 7). Treatment
with 1 significantly reduced the number of sprouts by
50% to 12 sprout/spheroids. This finding suggests that this

In contrast to the parent compound, we were unable
to detect positive β-galactosidase staining in RKO and
HCT116 cells upon exposure to 1 (data not shown). We
then determined whether the modified disorazole might

interact with microtubules, HSP90, was unchanged in all
the CRC cell lines after treatment with 1 (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

this field as new analogs and derivatives are continuously
being developed. In the present study, we characterized the
growth inhibitory effects and the biological mechanisms
of action of (-)-CP2-disorazole C1 (1), a bis-cyclopropane
stabilized analog of the antimitotic natural product
disorazole C1 [21], against human colorectal cancer
cells (CRC). Our results demonstrate that 1 inhibited
cell proliferation of a wide range of human CRC cells
including ABCB1-overexpressing cells resistant to both
vincristine and paclitaxel. The microtubule-stabilizing
agents, such as epothilones, have demonstrated similar
activity in ABCB1-overexpressing cells [26, 37].

Inhibitors of tubulin polymerization based on natural
products have played a key role in cancer treatment since
the anti-microtubule inhibitor vincristine, isolated from
the Madagascar periwinkle plant, was FDA-approved in
1963 [34, 35]. The mechanisms of resistance to this class
of compounds include overexpression of the drug efflux
pump protein ABCB1, microtubule cytoskeletal changes,
and overexpression of specific β-tubulin isotype and
microtubule-associated proteins [36]. To overcome these
resistance mechanisms, research has remained active in

Treatment of cells with 1 also led to a disruption in
microtubule formation and blocked tubulin polymerization
in vitro, suppressed protein expression of β-tubulin
subtypes in a time-dependent manner, altered expression
of microtubule-related proteins, induced apoptosis, and led
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to G2/M cell cycle blockade. Taken together, these findings
suggest that the novel microtubule disruptor 1 may be a
potential drug candidate for treatment of mCRC.
While the highly electrophilic disorazole A1 is
not favorable from a therapeutic perspective, a minor

component of the isolate, disorazole C1, which does not
contain the reactive vinyl oxirane moiety, was chemically
synthesized [16] and subsequently found to also disrupt
microtubule integrity and inhibit cell proliferation, albeit
at higher concentrations compared to A1. Because the
triene subunit of C1 is labile and biologically vulnerable,
isosteric bis-cyclopropanes were designed within the triene
structure as they also mimic the structure of the oxirane in
disorazole A1. Preliminary data with (-)-CP2-disorazole
C1 (1) revealed that that this molecule maintained
cellular cytotoxicity against a series of human CRC cell
lines [21]. Herein, we demonstrate that 1 is similar to
its parent disorazole C1 in that it disrupts microtubule
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

formation, displays potent nanomolar cytotoxicity against
a panel of human CRC cell lines, and blocks the cell
cycle in the G2/M phase. However, we did not observe
senescence as had been detected previously after C1
treatment. Interestingly, analog 1 caused DNA damage
as measured through induction of γ-H2AX whereas the
parent disorazole C1 did not. Thus, it is conceivable that a
structural change related to the bis-cyclopropane insertion
may have altered the binding mode of the modified
disorazole to β-tubulin resulting in subsequent changes on
downstream signaling pathways.
Disorazoles are thought to bind β-tubulin uniquely
among known microtubule destabilizers such as

vinblastine and dolastatin [18]. While all tested family
members have demonstrated the ability to disrupt
microtubule formation, we show that treatment with 1
also resulted in the loss of all three β-tubulin isotypes
identified in human CRC cells with no effect on
α-tubulin expression. Interestingly, expression of β-III
tubulin returned to baseline levels after 24 h, which
also coincided with an increase in the respective mRNA
levels. Overexpression of β-III tubulin in various solid
tumors may predict poor patient outcome suggesting
that upregulation of β-III tubulin mRNA may represent
a potential resistance mechanism to TBAs. In addition
to altering tubulin expression, we observed significant
effects on proteins known to associate with microtubules.
Previous studies have shown c-Myc to bind α-tubulin
and to co-localize in the cytoplasm [33]. Bourgarel-Rey
et. al. demonstrated that supra-high levels of vinblastine
(10 μM) can reduce c-Myc mRNA levels in HT29-D4
cells [38]. In sharp contrast, compound 1, at nanomolar
concentrations, potently suppressed c-Myc protein
expression in all human CRC cell lines. Similarly, APC
was decreased in these cells following treatment with 1.
APC, known for its role in regulating the Wnt signaling
pathway, is an RNA binding protein that binds to the
3′-UTR of several tubulin subtypes directing mRNA
localization and synthesis in the vicinity of microtubule
ends [39]. In a similar manner, the tumor suppressor p53
protein also binds and travels along tubulin. Previous
studies have shown that TBAs disrupt p53 nuclear
accumulation [40]. However, treatment with 1 resulted in
an increased expression of p53 in p53 wild-type cell lines.
Disorazole C1 was also able to increase p53 expression,
which was attributed to induction of senescence. Other
microtubule-associated proteins such as pERK, HSP27,
cyclin D1, and Rb, were similarly decreased after
treatment with 1. These alterations in protein expression
confirm recent studies demonstrating that TBAs may
function by inhibition of trafficking of DNA repair
proteins to the nucleus [41]. However, further studies
are needed to clarify the subset of cellular proteins that
are directly altered by loss of β-tubulin and those that are
down-regulated as a result of apoptotic processes.
In summary, our studies have shown that the
bis-cyclopropane disorazole 1 is highly effective
at suppressing proliferation in human colon cancer
cells through disruption of microtubules. Cell lines
overexpressing ABCB1 retain complete sensitivity to
compound 1. The resistance of normal colon epithelial
cells to the cytotoxic effects of 1 suggests that this class of
compounds may have an expanded therapeutic window.
The ability of 1 to reduce endothelial spreading further
suggests that this compound may also prevent spreading
and metastasis of primary tumors. Future studies will
focus on simplifying the chemical synthesis to permit
a scale-up of 1 for evaluation in in vivo animal tumor

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

models to determine the antitumor activity and toxicity
profile of this class of molecules.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
(-)-CP2-disorazole C1 (1) and 2 were synthesized as
previously described (Figure 1) [21]. Vincristine sulfate
and docetaxel were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St.
Louis, MO). For in vitro use, compounds were resuspended
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma) and the DMSO
concentration never exceeded 0.1% in any experiment.

Cell culture
The human colon cancer RKO and HCT15 cells and
normal human colon epithelial CCD841 CoN and FHC
cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). The parental HCT116 and subclone HCT116 p53/- and HCT116 p21-/- cell lines were kindly provided by Dr.
B. Vogelstein. H630 and H630R1 cell lines were originally
obtained from Dr. Adi Gazdar [42] and maintained in our
laboratory. All cells (except FHC cells) were maintained in
RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) with 10%
(V/V) fetal bovine serum at 37°C in a humidified incubator
with 5% CO2. FHC cells were maintained according to
ATCC guidelines. Human microvascular endothelial
cell line (HMEC-1) were cultured in MCDB-131 (Life
Technologies) growth medium supplemented with 10%
(v/v) FBS (Corning), 1 μg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma),
10 mM L-Glutamine (Life Technologies) and 10 ng/mL
EGF (Life Technologies). Cells were tested monthly for
mycoplasma by the MycoAlert Mycoplasma detection
assay (Cambrex BioScience; Rockland, ME).

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density
of 1000 cells/well. On the following day, cells were
incubated with 1, vincristine, and docetaxel for at least
three cell doublings (72 to 120 h). Normal epithelial cells
were incubated with these same agents for 7 days. Cell
proliferation was quantified by the WST-1 assay (Roche;
Indianapolis, IN).

Clonogenic assay
Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of
400 cells/well. On the following day, cells were treated
with 1 for 24 h, after which time, the growth medium was
replaced. After 8 days, cell colonies were fixed with trypan
blue solution (75% methanol/25% acetic acid/0.25%
trypan blue), washed, and air-dried before counting
colonies >50 cells.

Tubulin polymerization assay

anti-pSer139-H2AX (#2577, Cell Signaling), antiH2AX (#7631; Cell Signaling), anti-PARP (#9542, Cell
Signaling), anti-ABCB1 (#517310, Calbiochem). After
TBST washes (1X Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20),
membranes were incubated with corresponding
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were
detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method
(SuperSignal West Pico substrate; Pierce; Rockford, IL).

Tubulin polymerization assays were conducted
using the Tubulin Polymerization Assay Fluorescence
kit (cat#BK011P, Cytoskeleton Inc.; Denver, CO)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
100 μg of the reconstituted tubulin protein was added
to each well of a pre-warmed 96-well plate and exposed
to vehicle (0.1% DMSO), vincristine, docetaxel, 1, or
2. The absorbance excitation 360 nm and emission 450
nm was recorded every min for 1 h using a TECAN
Safire II microplate reader (TECAN U.S. Inc., Research
Triangle Park, NC) at 37°C. The dose-response curves
were plotted using Prism 3 (Graphpad Software Inc.;
San Diego, CA).

Stability of tubulin protein
H630 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. Cells were
treated with cycloheximide (10 mg/mL) and/or 1 (10 nM)
for various times before being harvested for immunoblot
analysis.

Immunofluorescence microtubule detection

Spheroid sprouting assay

H630 and H630R1 cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were
plated on glass coverslips in 12-well plates and allowed
to attach overnight. After treatment with 1 or 0.1%
DMSO for 18 h, cells were rinsed twice, fixed with
2% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X-100. After blocking with 2% BSA for 45 min,
coverslips were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibodies: anti-α-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody
(EMD Biosciences; San Diego, CA), and anti-β-tubulin
rabbit monoclonal antibody (# 2128, Cell Signaling, San
Francisco, CA). After washing, cells were incubated
with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Nuclei were
visualized by inclusion of Draq5 (Thermo Scientific;
Waltham, MA). Coverslips were mounted using AntiFade Fluoromount (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL),
and the images were taken using an Olympus FluoView
1000 confocal microscope with 63 × 1.45 numerical
aperture objective magnification and 565- and 488-nm
laser wavelengths.

A total of 500 HMEC-1 cells were suspended
in culture medium containing 0.25% (w/v)
carboxymethylcellulose and seeded in non-adherent roundbottom 96-well plates [43]. Cells were allowed to aggregate
for 24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. To perform the 3D collagen gel
sprouting assay, type I collagen gel was made with 1 mg/mL
collagen (Millipore), 0.25% (w/v) methylcellulose solution,
10% FBS and pH was adjusted to 7.4 with 5 M NaOH.
Spheroids were collected and mixed with chilled type I
collagen solution containing 2 nM 1. Collagen containing
approximately 6–10 spheroids was added into a pre-warmed
24-well plate and allowed to polymerize at 37°C for 1 h.
MCDB-131 growth medium (200 μL) containing 2 nM
1 was pipetted on the top of gel and incubated at 37°C in
5% CO2. The number of sprouts per spheroid was counted
manually under the microscope.

Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as the mean ± S.D.
and represent data from at least three independent
experiments. Student’s t-tests (two-tailed) were used to
analyze differences between two groups, and P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Immunoblot analysis
Protein concentrations of cell lysates were
determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad;
Hercules, CA). Equal amounts of protein (20 μg)
from each cell lysate were resolved on Criterion TGX
precast gels and transferred onto 0.45 μm nitrocellulose
membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked and
incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies:
anti-total-β-tubulin (#2128; Cell Signaling), anti-β-Itubulin (#T7816, Sigma), anti-β-III-tubulin (#MMS435P, Covance), anti-β-IV-tubulin (#T7941, Sigma),
anti-APC (#OP44, Calbiochem; San Diego, CA), anti-Rb
(#9313, Cell Signaling), anti-pTyr204-ERK (#SC-7383,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA), anti-ERK1
(#SC-94, Santa Cruz), anti-Cyclin D1 (#2978, Cell
Signaling), anti-Hsp27 (#2402, Cell Signaling),
