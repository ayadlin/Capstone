Abstract:

Recent studies indicate the importance of the ubiquitin ligase Siah2 in control of more
aggressive prostate tumors – namely, neuroendocrine (NE) prostate tumors and
prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) harboring neuroendocrine lesions. Siah2-dependent
expression and activity of HIF-1α regulate its availability to form a transcriptional
complex with FoxA2, resulting in expression of specific target genes, including Hes6,
Sox9 and Jmjd1a, whose co-expression is sufficient for formation of NE tumors and NE
lesions in PCa. These studies provide novel markers to diagnose and monitor formation
of NE lesions and NE tumors. Furthermore, defining the regulatory axis consisting of
Siah2 and HIF-1α/FoxA2 cooperation suggests novel therapeutic modalities to treat
these most aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Here we review current understanding
of Siah role in control of hypoxia and prostate tumor development and highlight
potential approaches for targeting components along Siah-regulated pathways.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah and
its role in hypoxia

binding. Siah can elicit ubiquitination and degradation of
PHD1/3 and FIH, thus stabilizing HIF-α and promoting
its transcriptional activity [9, 10]. In addition, Siah has
been shown to regulate the stability of HIPK2 [11, 12], a
transcriptional repressor of the HIF-1α gene [13]. Thus,
via three independent pathways, Siah contributes to
HIF-α transcription, stability and activity. Consistently,
cancer cells lacking Siah or expressing a Siah inhibitory
peptide exhibit reduced levels and activity of HIF-α [7,
8].

Siah is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that
mediates ubiquitination and degradation of substrates
important in stress-activated signaling pathways [1, 2].
In humans, Siah has two isoforms, Siah1 and Siah2,
which usually target similar substrates. Siah consists of
an N-terminal RING finger domain, a central cysteinerich domain and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain
[3]. The important role played by Siah in progression
of multiple types of cancer, including lung, pancreatic,
breast, prostate and melanoma, is evidenced by inhibition
of these tumors in experimental models following
attenuation of Siah activity [4-8].
HIF, the master regulator of hypoxia responses,
controls diverse transcriptional programs under hypoxic
conditions. HIF consists of a heterodimer between
α-subunit (HIF-1α or HIF-2α) and β-subunit (HIF-1β).
HIF-α levels are regulated by PHD (prolyl-hydroxylase)mediated hydroxylation of two proline residues that
leads to VHL-dependent degradation. In addition HIF-α
activities are regulated by FIH (factor inhibiting HIF1α)-mediated asparagine hydroxylation that inhibits
HIF transcriptional activity by disrupting p300/CBP

cancer
development and progression
Prostate cancers are the most common malignancy
in American men [14]. Hence, understanding mechanism
underlying the development and progression of prostate
cancers offers possible means for monitoring and therapy.
Our recent study demonstrates the importance of the
Siah-HIF axis in development of prostate NE tumors and
NE lesions in human prostate adenocarcinomas, which
are among the more aggressive prostate tumors. Although
prostate NE carcinomas are rare (< 5%), over 30% of
human prostate adenocarcinomas show expression of
NE markers (e.g. NSE, chromogranin), often referred to

as NE differentiation (NED) or the NE phenotype. NED
of prostate cancers is associated with tumor progression,
resistance to therapy (such as androgen-deprivation
therapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), and poor prognosis
[15-18].
To evaluate a potential role for Siah in prostate
tumor progression, we crossed Siah-deficient (Siah2-/- or
Siah1a+/-::Siah2-/-) mice with the TRAMP mouse model.
Prostate-specific expression of SV40 T antigen in the
TRAMP mice leads to formation of two major types of
lesions: prostate NE carcinoma and atypical hyperplasia
(AH). Siah-deficiency significantly reduced formation
of prostate NE carcinoma in TRAMP mice, while AH
lesions were less affected. Siah-deficient TRAMP NE
tumors showed reduced HIF-1α levels, decreased cell
proliferation, increased cell death, but no apparent effect
on vascular density. To confirm that impaired NE tumor
formation is due to Siah’s effect on HIF, we transfected
TRAMP cells with a Siah inhibitory peptide and observed
reduced HIF-1α levels and inhibited tumor formation
in nude mice. Conversely, forced re-expression of HIF1α in TRAMP cells expressing Siah inhibitory peptide
partially restored these cells’ ability to form xenograft
tumors, indicating that Siah regulation of HIF is essential
for development of NE prostate tumors in the TRAMP
model. Consistent with our study, AhR (aryl hydrocarbon
receptor)-null TRAMP mice showed increased formation
of NE carcinoma but not of AH [19]. Since HIF-1β
dimerizes with both AhR and HIF-1α, lack of AhR may
promote the formation of HIF-1α/HIF-1β dimers, thereby
enhancing HIF activity and formation of NE carcinoma
[20]. These observations underscore the importance of
HIF in the development of prostate NE carcinoma in the
TRAMP model.
The finding that NE tumors can no longer develop in
the absence of Siah, combined with observation of reduced
HIF-1α expression, led us to explore the possibility that
HIF-1α activity is required for the formation of NE
phenotypes. In addition to HIF-1β, HIF-α can also interact
with other transcription factors such as β-catenin, Notch,
c-Myc [21-24]. Thus, we tested the possibility that HIF
may elicit a tissue-specific transcriptional program by
interacting with factors expressed in NE tumors. Among
transcription factors that are important for the formation
of NE tumors in the TRAMP model is FoxA2 [25], a
member of the Fork-head family of transcription factors
consisting of FoxA1, FoxA2 and FoxA3 [26]. Although
FoxA1 is expressed in both NE tumors and AH, FoxA2
is only expressed in NE tumors in the TRAMP or LADY
model [25, 27]. Using an HRE-luciferase assay that serves
as a marker for HIF activity, we discovered FoxA2/HIF
transcriptional synergy [7]. Notably, FoxA2 interacted
with HIF-1α via the N-terminal domains of each protein,
promoting recruitment of p300 to specific HIF target genes
and activating transcription. Consistent with the possibility
that p300 can be recruited by specific HIF transcriptional
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

program to induce a select set of proteins is the reports
that MEFs isolated from mice harboring a mutant form of
p300/CPB, which cannot interact with HIF-α, or MEFs
derived from FIH KO mice showed impaired expression
of only a subset of HIF target genes under hypoxia [28,
29], supporting the notion that p300/CBP is required
for expression of specific HIF target genes. Cooperation
between FoxA2 and HIF-1α resulted in transcriptional
activity that was substantially greater than that seen by HIF
alone. Microarray analyses identified approximately 40
genes (such as, Hes6, Sox9, Jmjd1a, and Plod2) that were
co-regulated by HIF and FoxA2 in TRAMP cells, pointing
to a specific transcriptional program that is regulated by
this cooperation. Notably, some of the proteins that are
regulated by HIF-1α-FoxA2 cooperation were reported
to be HIF targets. In addition, FOXA binding sites have
been found in some of the genes co-regulated by HIF and
FoxA2 [7], providing additional explanation for HIF/
FoxA2 synergy on specific HIF targets.
Following the identification of HIF/FoxA2 target
genes, we assessed their importance in development of
prostate NE tumors. In these studies we have focused
on assessing three genes: Hes6, Sox9 and Jmjd1a, which
were implicated in prostate tumors, and were shown
(by us and others) to be regulated by HIF. To this end,
TRAMP cells were engineered to express Siah-inhibitory
peptide or FoxA2 shRNA. These modified cells showed
reduced tumor-forming capacity in an orthotopic prostate
tumor model. Significantly, co-expression of Hes6,
Sox9 and Jmjd1a partially rescued tumorigenic capacity
in the presence of Siah-inhibitory peptide, confirming
the significance of the pathway in prostate NE tumor
development. Notably, re-expression of Hes6, Sox 9
or Jmjd1a individually was not sufficient to rescue
tumorigenesis in TRAMP cells in which either HIF or
FOXA2 was inhibited, indicating that multiple genes
regulated by HIF/FoxA2 are required for development
of prostate NE tumors. We expect that co-expression of
additional genes identified to be regulated by the HIF/
FoxA2 program will increase the rescue of these tumors.

Siah controls the formation of
NE lesions in adenocarcinoma of
the prostate.
The specific transcriptional program mediated by
HIF and FoxA2 also plays a key role in development of
NE lesions (aka NED or NE phenotype) in human prostate
adenocarcinoma. As a model to study NE phenotype in
vitro we used the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell
line CWR22Rv1. Notably, when maintained under
hypoxia for few days these cells show upregulation
of the NE marker NSE and protrusion of neurite-like
structures [7]. Correspondingly, orthotopic prostate
tumors formed in mice by these human PCa cells exhibit
high NSE levels in necrotic regions, which are known to

Importantly, the incidence of NED is elevated in prostate
cancer patients after androgen deprivation therapy [37].
Androgen deprivation causes damage of blood vessels in
the prostate or prostate tumors with a consequent increase
in hypoxia [38-40], which may contribute to the NED of
prostate cancers. This possibility is consistent with our
observation that NED occurs primarily in more hypoxic
regions.
Recent evidence indicates the presence of a small
population of self-renewing and multipotent cells within
solid tumors, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs) or tumorinitiating cells [41]. These cells share many features with
somatic and embryonic stem (ES) cells and are believed
to drive tumor progression, metastasis and resistance to
therapy. NED lesions of prostate cancers have been shown
to express the stem cell marker Oct4A and the CSC marker
CD44 [42, 43], implying that the NED lesions may harbor
prostate cancer stem cells. In the TRAMP model, prostate
NE tumors are believed to be derived from prostate stem
cells in the mouse proximal prostate gland [25, 44]. The
importance of Siah/HIF/FoxA2 axis in the formation of
TRAMP NE tumor and NED of human prostate cancers
suggests this signaling pathway may play a key role in the
prostate stem cell function.

be highly hypoxic. Thus, hypoxia appears to be important
for prostate cancer NE phenotypes in vitro and in vivo.
The in vitro NE phenotype of the CWR22Rv1 cells was
Siah/HIF and FoxA2 dependent and could be rescued
upon co-expression of the Hes6, Sox9 and Jmjd1a genes.
Orthotopic injection of CWR22Rv1 cells expressing
Siah-inhibitory peptide or FoxA2 shRNA did not alter
their ability to develop tumors but rather abolished their
propensity to metastasize and inhibited the appearance
of NE phenotypes. Co-expression of Hes6, Sox9 and
Jmjd1a was sufficient to rescue metastasis, indicating the
importance of the NE phenotype the metastatic capacity
of CWR22Rv1 cells. Consistent with these observations,
immunohistochemistry staining of a prostate cancer
TMA and analysis of a microarray data revealed higher
levels of Siah2, FoxA2, Hes6, Sox9, Jmjd1a and NSE in
high-grade human PCa (Gleason score 4 and 5) and in
metastatic prostate cancers [7]. These findings underscore
the importance of the Siah2/HIF/FoxA2 axis in PCa NE
phenotype, tumor progression and metastasis.
Among other PCa cells that exhibit NED in culture
are LNCaP cells. Although diverse stimuli, such as IL-6,
radiation, or androgen deprivation, can induce NED in
cultured LNCaP cells [30-32], androgen deprivation is
the main inducer of NED in the mouse model [33-36].

NED lesions in the PCa. Arrows point to components in this pathway that can be used for diagnosis and therapeutic targeting.

provide tools necessary to assess treatment efficacy. The
availability of novel NED markers should also promote
research into different types of NED (i.e., staining of the
NE markers in single cells, cell clusters, or diffuse areas
within PCa) and facilitate characterization of possible
prostate CSCs within these lesions.

A. Diagnostics
Based on our identification of novel proteins
associated with the NE lesions and NE prostate tumors we
assessed expression of Hes6 and Sox9 in tissue specimens.
These studies, performed by IHC, demonstrated the
ability to detect NE lesions in the high-grade prostate
cancers. Given the difficulty of detecting NE lesions, the
availability of new markers should promote development
of additional antibodies and improved methods to detect
these lesions, which are associated with poor prognosis.
The ability to better define NE tumors and lesions at early
disease stages should also impact treatment options and

B. Therapeutic Strategies
As shown in Fig 1, the findings that Siah controls levels
and activity of HIF-1α, which cooperates transcriptionally
with FoxA2 to promote NE tumor development or
formation of NED of human prostate cancers, provide a
rationale for targeting the Siah/HIF/FoxA2 axis as a new
therapeutic modality. Such an approach is supported by the
following: (1) the presence of NED in PCa is associated
with resistance to current therapies, including androgen
deprivation therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy; and
(2) androgen deprivation therapy or radiotherapy may
induce NED of prostate cancers. Therefore, targeting the
Siah/HIF/FoxA2 axis should inhibit the NE phenotype,
sensitizing tumors to traditional prostate cancer therapy.
Three components in the newly discovered pathway
could be targeted as potential therapies. Of the three,
Siah is likely the best candidate, since its loss abolishes
formation of TRAMP NE tumors and restoring HIF
expression in such tumor cells only partially (30%) rescues
formation of NE tumors. Notably, FoxA2 inhibition is less
effective in attenuating NE tumor formation. As a RING
finger E3 ubiquitin ligase Siah could be targeted in several
ways. The least favorable is targeting its RING domain,
given its similarity with the RING domain present in
other E3 ligases. A Siah domain that would allow more
specific inhibition is the substrate-binding groove,
which is required for binding with adaptors or substrates
containing a peptide motif RPVAxVxPxxR, that mediates
the interaction of Siah protein with a range of protein
partners [45, 46]. A high-affinity interaction with a peptide
from the cytoskeletal protein plectin-1 (residues 95–117)
was identified with an apparent Kd of about 29 nM [45].
Given availability of structural data concerning the Siah2adaptor binding complex, and given the available crystal
structure of Siah2 one can envision use of structurebased design of peptides and peptide-mimetics that
selectively interfere with Siah2 association with selective
substrates or adaptor proteins (Figure 2). Structurebased design combined with high throughput screening
may allow identification of small molecules to block the
Siah substrate-binding domain (SBD). Supporting this
approach is the observation that a 22 aa Siah inhibitory
peptide can bind to the Siah SBD and reduce HIF levels
under hypoxia [47]. A structure-based approach may be
complemented by assessing the effect of inhibitors on
Siah2 self-ubiquitination, a property inherent to RING
finger E3 ligases. As a proof of principle, we recently
established a Meso-Scale-based assay and, out of 2000

compounds, identified Menadione as a Siah2 inhibitor.
Menadione treatment inhibited HIF levels in cultured
cells, increased expression of direct Siah2 targets, and
inhibited formation of melanoma xenografts [48]. Given
that inhibition of Siah2 provides an unprecedented
opportunity for the discovery of novel anti-cancer agents
we believe that further drug discovery efforts are justified.
Several inhibitors directed against HIF have been
recently developed [49-51]. It is of importance to assess
their effects in prostate tumor models, including those
used in our recent studies. A more specific target emerging
from our studies, however, is the HIF/FoxA2 structural
interface. The crystal structure of this complex or domain
should provide information required to develop highly
specific inhibitors. Although these inhibitors may not be
as potent as HIF or Siah inhibitors, they could be more
specific to the NE phenotype. Notably, targeting proteinprotein interaction has been a less favorable approach
for drug design; thus development of more advanced
technologies is required to make this task more feasible.
Structure-based approaches will likely dominate the
search for Siah and HIF/FoxA2 inhibitors.
Inhibiting specific HIF-FoxA2 targets is also a
possibility. Some of these proteins identified in our
studies, such as Jmjd1a and Plod2, exhibit intrinsic
enzymatic activity. Studies are underway to assess the
consequence of their selective inhibition on NE tumors
and NED lesions in culture and in vivo. Of consideration
is the notion that unless inhibitors are targeted specifically
to NE cells, blocking these enzymes might promote
pleiotropic effects.
Targeting components along the newly discovered
Siah/HIF/FoxA2 axis, which functions in formation
of prostate cancer NE phenotypes and is potentially
associated with the prostate cancer stem cells, should
complement current diagnosis and therapies for prostate
cancer patients whose tumors harbor NE markers.
