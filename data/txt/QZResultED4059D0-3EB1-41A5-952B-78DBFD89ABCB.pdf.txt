BACKGROUND: Efatutazone (CS-7017), a novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARc) agonist, exerts anticancer
activity in preclinical models. The authors conducted a phase 1 study to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of efatutazone. METHODS: Patients with advanced solid malignancies and no curative therapeutic options
were enrolled to receive a given dose of efatutazone, administered orally (PO) twice daily for 6 weeks, in a 3 þ 3 intercohort doseescalation trial. After the third patient, patients with diabetes mellitus were excluded. Efatutazone dosing continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, with measurement of efatutazone pharmacokinetics and plasma adiponectin levels. RESULTS:
Thirty-one patients received efatutazone at doses ranging from 0.10 to 1.15 mg PO twice daily. Dose escalation stopped when maximal impact on PPARc-related biomarkers had been reached before any protocol-defined maximum-tolerated dose level. On the basis
of a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis, the recommended phase 2 dose was 0.5 mg PO twice daily. A majority
of patients experienced peripheral edema (53.3%), often requiring diuretics. Three episodes of dose-limiting toxicities, related to fluid
retention, were noted in the 0.10-, 0.25-, and 1.15-mg cohorts. Of 31 treated patients, 27 were evaluable for response. A sustained
partial response (PR; 690 days on therapy) was observed in a patient with myxoid liposarcoma. Ten additional patients had stable
disease (SD) for 60 days. Exposures were approximately dose proportional, and adiponectin levels increased after 4 weeks of
treatment at all dose levels. Immunohistochemistry of archived specimens demonstrated that PPARc and retinoid X receptor
expression levels were significantly greater in patients with SD for 60 days or PR (P ¼ .0079), suggesting a predictive biomarker.
CONCLUSIONS: Efatutazone demonstrates acceptable tolerability with evidence of disease control in patients with advanced maligC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors.1-4 There are 3 PPAR isoforms, a, b/d, and c, all of which heterodimerize with the retinoid-X
receptors (RXRs) to modulate DNA transcription. The PPARs play a variety of roles in cellular metabolism and inflammation, but the profound prodifferentiation and proapoptotic effects of the PPARc agonists led to further exploration of
their potential as anticancer agents.5-7 PPARc agonists reduce cell growth and induce differentiation in several cancer cell
lines.3-11 In vivo, PPARc agonists slow the growth of tumors in rodents, both in carcinogen-induced tumor models and in
ectopically implanted cancer cell lines.4,12

Figure 1. Multiple antitumor mechanisms of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARc) agonists are shown.
AMPK, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; COX-2, cyclooxygenase 2; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EMT,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IL, interleukin; NF-jB, nuclear factor kappa B; PGE2,
prostaglandin E2; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue; RXR, retinoid-X receptor; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor; VEGF,
vascular endothelial growth factor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; mTor, mammalian target of rapamycin; pAKT, phospho-protein
kinase B.

Mechanistically, PPARc agonists inhibit tumorigenesis through several pathways (Fig. 1). They prevent
cell-cycle progression via up-regulation of cell cycle inhibitors (eg, p18, p21, p27)13-19; decrease angiogenesis and
inflammation via the cyclooxygenase 2 and prostaglandin
E2 pathway20; induce autophagy via the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and mammalian target
of rapamycin complex 1 pathway21; reduce production of
cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 via nuclear
factor kappa B22; disrupt tumor-stromal interactions
required for metastasis through phosphatase and tensin
homologue (PTEN) and phosphorylated protein kinase B
(pAKT)20,22; prevent cell migration by suppressing Snail
and upregulating E-cadherin22; and inhibit cell growth
through inhibition or down-regulation of the mitogenactivated protein extracellular regulated kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade.23
Endogenous PPAR ligands include fatty acids and
eicosanoids,3 but their normal biological function is not
5404

well defined. Several synthetic ligands,2-4 including the
thiazolidinediones (eg, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone), are
potent PPARc agonists. Rosiglitazone (Avandia, GSK)
and pioglitazone (Actos, Takeda) are US Food and Drug
Administration-approved treatments, used extensively by
patients with diabetes because of their effects of enhancing
glucose metabolism; however, clinical data on the use of
the PPARc agonists as anticancer agents are limited. In a
small percentage of prostate cancer patients, rosiglitazone
either decreased or prolonged the stabilization of prostatespecific antigen levels.24 Patients with recurrent metastatic
liposarcoma treated with pioglitazone had prolonged disease stabilization.25 In a large epidemiologic study of
87,678 patient records, a statistically significant 33%
reduction in lung cancer risk among thiazolidinedione
users versus nonusers was observed.26

subtypes. Efatutazone is at least 50 more potent than
rosiglitazone and 500 more potent than troglitazone at
PPAR response element activation and inhibition of cancer cell growth.27 Efatutazone inhibits proliferation of
human pancreatic and anaplastic thyroid tumor-cell cultures, as well as growth of human colorectal tumor xenografts in nude rodents.28 The antitumor activity of
efatutazone in vivo may be enhanced in combination with
cytotoxic agents including gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and irinotecan.27 A phase 1 study evaluating pharmacokinetics
and safety of single-dose efatutazone concluded that doses
of 0.04 mg and 0.08 mg were well tolerated (data on file,
Daiichi Sankyo Pharmaceutical Development). On the
basis of these data, we have conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation study of oral efatutazone administered by continuous twice-daily dosing. The objectives were to determine
the recommended phase 2 dose for efatutazone, the safety
profile, preliminary antitumor effects, and pharmacokinetics, and to explore potential predictive biomarkers of
efatutazone activity and clinical benefit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Eligible patients had histologic or cytologic evidence of
metastatic or advanced solid malignancy that had either
progressed on standard therapies and/or for which no curative therapy exists. Patients were aged 18 years, had an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
score of 2, and had adequate organ and bone marrow
function (hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL, absolute neutrophil
count 1.5  109/L, platelet count 100  109/L, serum creatinine level <1.5 mg/dL, total bilirubin level
1.5  upper limit of normal [ULN], and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels within normal limits
of patients with no liver metastases and 1.5  ULN in
patients with liver metastases). Patients were excluded if
they had any of the following: pre-existing fluid retention
(defined as clinically significant pleural or pericardial effusions, as determined by the investigators); prior treatment
with efatutazone or other thiazolidinediones; chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, any investigational
agent, or minor surgery within 4 weeks before study entry;
or mitomycin C, immunotherapy, biological therapy, or
major surgery within 6 weeks before study entry. In the
final protocol, amended after the third patient was enrolled,
patients with diabetes mellitus were also excluded. The
study protocol, amendments, informed consent/assent
form(s), and information sheets were approved by the
appropriate and applicable independent ethics committees

or institutional review boards. Investigators obtained
informed consent from each participant or their guardian.
Study Design and Treatment Schedule

This was a 2-center, phase 1, open label, dose-escalation
study of oral efatutazone administered twice daily for 21
days per cycle. Patients were treated in cohorts of 3 to 6 at
dose levels of 0.10, 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.15
mg twice daily. Initial dosing was based on animal toxicology studies and set to target an area under the curve
(AUC) of 1% of the lethal AUC in monkeys (data on file,
Daiichi-Sankyo Pharmaceutical Development). Safety
assessments were performed weekly, and dose escalation
was continued until determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD; defined as 1 dose level below the dose
that induced a drug-related dose-limiting toxicity [DLT]
during the first 3 weeks of therapy in 2 of 6 patients) or
until the recommended phase 2 dose was established by
the investigators. DLTs were defined by the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 as follows: grade
3 pleural effusion or pericardial effusion; grade 3 peripheral edema or ascites that is unresponsive to therapy;
other grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities except alopecia, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, or fever without neutropenia; failure to recover to baseline toxicity (except alopecia)
after delaying the next dose by >2 weeks; 3  ULN for
AST/ALT in combination with a total bilirubin 2 
ULN; grade 3 or 4 neutropenia complicated by fever
38.5 C or infection, or grade 4 neutropenia of 7 days
duration; and grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or grade 3
thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage. Tumor
response was assessed radiographically every 2 cycles using
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
version 1.0. Electrocardiograms were performed at screening and after each cycle per protocol, and echocardiograms were performed at baseline, at the end of cycle 1
(week 3), and at the end of cycle 2 (study week 6), then every 6 weeks, to assess for any evidence of cardiac dysfunction. Study treatment was continued without interruption
in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease (PD).
Pharmacokinetic and Activity Biomarker
Analysis

Blood samples for pharmacokinetics were obtained at
baseline and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 to 10 hours after the
first dose on day 1 of cycles 1 and 2. A validated liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was
used to measure efatutazone (R-150033) plasma concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters included AUC,

tissues were evaluated to establish immunoreactivity and
assay specificity. Intra-assay and interassay performance
were also evaluated as components of the validation procedure. Staining for each biomarker was described as strong
(3þ), moderate (2þ), weak (1þ), or absent (0), and the
percentage of positively stained tumor cells was also
reported. Patients were grouped into those showing clinical benefit (those with stable disease [SD] for 60 days or
a partial response [PR]) versus those showing no clinical
benefit (those with PD or SD for <60 days).

and time of maximum plasma drug concentration. Pharmacokinetic variables were computed using WinNonlin
Professional or other appropriate software.
Adiponectin is a marker of PPARc activation. Blood
samples for adiponectin measurement were obtained at
baseline (before cycle 1) and every 3 weeks thereafter. Adiponectin levels were measured using a solid phase quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay kit (Quantikine;
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn).
Immunohistochemical Analysis

Freshly cut slides were used to perform immunohistochemical analysis of several key proteins, including
PPARc, RXR, ERK1, ERK2, phospho-ERK, AKT, phospho-AKT, survivin, and PTEN using validated assays.
The immunohistochemical staining was performed and
validated for detecting PPARc or RXRc protein expression at a central laboratory (Esoterix, Austin, Tex). The
PPARc or RXRc assays were developed using a PPARcspecific mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif) or an RXRc-specific rabbit
antibody (Spring Bioscience, Pleasanton, Calif) on the
Ventana Benchmark XT automated staining platform,
using the ultraVIEW Universal DAB detection system
(Vantana Medical Systems, Inc.). The verification of
staining performance was confirmed on a series of cancer
tissue samples. In addition, a series of normal, nontumor

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

A total of 32 patients were enrolled in the study, 31
patients were treated, and 27 were evaluable for response;
1 patient withdrew before starting therapy. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Colorectal carcinoma was the most common tumor type among patients
(n ¼ 12). Most patients (84%) had received prior cancer
therapy, with an average of 5.2 lines of prior therapy
(range, 0-15). Thirty patients received prior surgery, and
16 received prior radiation.
Safety

All 31 treated patients were evaluable for safety analysis.
Dosing with efatutazone was overall tolerable, with fluid
retention as a common adverse event (AE), manageable
by diuretics. All treated patients experienced at least 1 AE,
regardless of attribution. Table 2 summarizes efatutazonerelated treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) observed in
5% of patients. Overall, 31 patients (100%) experienced at least 1 treatment-related AE, the most common
being peripheral edema (51.6%), weight increase
(54.8%), anemia (38.7%), and fatigue (45.2%). No
patient experienced grade 4 edema. Three DLTs related
to fluid retention were observed, but were not dose
dependent.
One patient in the 0.10-mg cohort, with a history of
pleural effusion, edema, congestive heart failure, and current insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus experienced
increased pleural effusion and dyspnea requiring treatment suspension. The effusion resolved upon withholding
efatutazone dosing, but recurred with resumed efatutazone dosing despite a dose reduction. On the basis of the
increased risk of clinically significant fluid retention for
patients on thiazolidinediones with concurrent insulin
therapy, the protocol was amended after the DLT in
Patient 3 to exclude patients with diabetes mellitus. One
patient each in the 0.25- and 1.15-mg cohorts also experienced grade 3 edema requiring treatment to be

Approximately 16 months after the first patient enrollment, study sites were requested to immediately administer diuretics if a patient experienced a 2-kg weight
increase from baseline. Treatment included 20 mg/d of
furosemide and 25mg/d of spironolactone. Dosages were
doubled for each 2-kg weight gain from baseline, up to
maximum dosages of 80 mg/d for furosemide and 100

Two patients experienced grade 4 TEAEs; 1 patient
experienced bronchospasm not likely to be related to efatutazone, and 1 patient experienced hypercholesterolemia
and hypertriglyceridemia probably related to efatutazone.
There was no apparent relation between treatment dose
level and grade 3 or 4 TEAE (no grade 5 events) incidence, and the MTD was not reached. Dose escalation
was stopped at 1.15 mg of efatutazone because data indicated no additional dose-related effect on serum adiponectin levels, a sensitive biomarker of PPARc activity

(Fig. 2). Thus, the recommended phase 2 oral dose was
determined to be 0.5 mg twice daily, the dose at which
biomarker activity (ie, plasma adiponectin levels)
plateaued.
Pharmacokinetics

After oral administration of efatutazone, the drug is converted to the active metabolite R-150033. In plasma, the
peak concentrations of R-150033 were observed at 2 to 3
hours postdose (Fig. 3). The mean apparent half-life
ranged from 5.7 to 14 hours and appeared to be similar
across all dose levels. After single and multiple doses of
efatutazone, the increase in exposure (AUC and Cmax) of
R-150033 appears to be dose proportional over the investigated dose range of 0.10 to 1.15 mg twice daily (Fig. 4
and Table 3). On the basis of trough plasma concentrations, efatutazone twice daily appeared to reach steadystate levels by week 1 of cycle 2. Accumulation with multiple dosing to steady-state was approximately 140% to
180% across all doses, which is consistent with the halflife and dosing regimen.
Activity Biomarker Analyses

Efatutazone administration increased plasma adiponectin
levels 6- to 14-fold at all dose levels of 0.10 to 1.15 mg
twice daily (Fig. 2). Although the increase in adiponectin
appeared to be dose dependent, because of the small sample size (3-6 patients) and high interpatient variability, a
definitive conclusion is not possible, and statistical analysis revealed no significant dose-dependent effect on the
efatutazone-mediated increase in plasma adiponectin
levels.

for patients with SD or PR was 126 days (range, 66-690
days). There was no relation between duration of SD and
dose level (Table 5). The median overall survival and time
to disease progression were 283 days and 51 days,
respectively.
Patient 20 is a 44-year-old man with metastatic
myxoid liposarcoma with a confirmed rearrangement of
the DDIT3 gene at chromosome 12q13 (Mayo Medical
Laboratories, Rochester, Minn) who was initially diagnosed in July 2006, and had 2 prior major resections and
stereotactic radiosurgery at 3 sites of recurrence. He was
started on oral efatutazone at 0.75 mg twice daily in April
2008, and exhibited a RECIST-defined PR to therapy by
July 2008, with further decrease in tumor volume and a
nadir reduction in tumor size of approximately 49% in
June 2009. A positron emission tomography/computed
tomography scan performed in November 2008 revealed
no fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the remaining tumors.
Interestingly, this patient, who had no prior history of
hypercholesterolemia/triglyceridemia, by cycle 3, day 1
had a dramatic increase (to CTCAE grade 4) in serum
cholesterol (peak 515 mg/dL) and triglycerides (peak
4525 mg/dL). His dose of efatutazone was held, and his
hypercholesterolemia/triglyceridemia recovered to baseline. However, upon restarting therapy and later despite
dose reduction to 0.5 mg twice daily, he had a renewed
increase to grade 3 requiring the addition of pravastatin
(ultimately up to 80 mg daily). He was finally able to tolerate a dose of efatutazone of 0.5 mg daily by cycle 7, and
remained on study (with a continued decrease in tumor
volume despite dose reduction) for 690 days. Of note, no
other patient in this trial had an increase in serum cholesterol or triglycerides. The patient subsequently underwent
surgical resection of his 4 residual tumors; 3 demonstrated
no evidence of viable disease, whereas the fourth demonstrated persistent myxoid liposarcoma. The patient
remains alive and without any evidence of disease recurrence as of June 2011.
Pretreatment Immunohistochemical Analysis

Archived tumor tissue was available for 21 of the 31
study patients. Freshly cut slides were used to perform
immunohistochemical analysis of several key proteins
(Fig. 6). Recognizing that the formation of a bimolecular complex of PPARc and RXR requires both analytes
to be present in the same cell, we compared the product
of the expression frequencies (determined as the percentage positive cells) of PPARc and RXR in tumor specimens (an indirect approximation to the percentage of
cells actually expressing both receptors) in those who

(ROC) analysis of sensitivity versus specificity of the comparison, as a function of the cutoff value between predicted clinical benefit and lack of clinical benefit. On the
basis of limited data, the optimal cutoff (closest distance
to the point of 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity) is
10, corresponding to a sensitivity of 0.83 and a specificity
of 0.91. The area under the ROC curve was 0.89,

DISCUSSION
For years, preclinical evidence has suggested that PPARc
agonists may have activity as anticancer agents. In preclinical models and in vitro, thiazolidinedione and nonthiazolidinedione PPARc agonists have demonstrated
significant anticancer activity.3-12 The activation of
Cancer

PPARc results in cell-cycle arrest, inhibition of angiogenesis, induction of apoptosis, and, in some cases, cellular
redifferentiation. These effects are typically induced by
direct modulation of gene transcription through activation of peroxisome proliferator response elements in the
promoter regions of several key genes. PPARc-activation
results in cell-cycle arrest through direct transcriptional
down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression and up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitors p18, p21, and p27.13-19
Also, nontranscriptional mechanisms for the activity of
PPARc exist, including the proteosomal degradation of
b-catenin.29 Despite these pleiotropic effects, as in the
case with other nuclear hormone receptor agonists such as
the vitamin D analogs and the retinoids, the promise of
the PPARc agonists as effective anticancer agents in
humans has yet to be realized. Several clinical trials have
failed to demonstrate any substantial anticancer benefit
with thiazolidinediones,24,30 although a large retrospective study suggests benefit with the thiazolidinediones as
chemopreventative agents.26 In this context, efatutazone
may have greater anticancer activity than previously studied thiazolidinediones, perhaps as a result of increased potency and specificity as a PPARc agonist.
This study demonstrates that efatutazone can be
administered safely in doses at which PPARc-responsive
gene expression is induced. Efatutazone was tolerated and
no measurable cardiotoxicity was recorded. Fluid retention, an expected thiazolidinediones class effect, was a

common side effect but was manageable with diuretics. A
protocol for controlling fluid retention, including the
addition of the diuretics furosemide and spironolactone,
was added after it was noted that several patients experienced rapid weight gain. Anemia was another common
side effect, typically associated with the thiazolidinedione
class of drugs. Traditionally this class effect was believed
to be a result of the increased intravascular volume causing
a relative hemodilution. However, this prevailing view has
been questioned,31 and no definitive mechanism has yet
been established.
An effect of efatutazone on the PPARc-regulated
gene product adiponectin was observed. Adiponectin
gene activation occurred even at lower dose levels of efatutazone, with maximal activation occurring in the range of
0.35 to 1.15 mg twice daily. A population-based pharmacokinetic/adiponectin modeling analysis, using data from
every patient, established a dose-response relation, and
identified an optimal dose corresponding to a predicted
>90% increase in adiponectin expression levels relative to
pretreatment. On the basis of these results, oral efatutazone 0.5 mg twice daily was chosen as the recommended
phase 2 dose.
Efatutazone also showed signs of possible antitumor
activity. In particular, 1 patient with metastatic myxoid
liposarcoma had a sustained PR. Myxoid liposarcomas are
characterized by the chromosomal translocation
t(12;16)(q13;p11), which produces the chimeric FUS5412

DDIT3 oncogene.32 Expression of this fusion oncoprotein results in a block of adipocyte differentiation that can
be overcome by increasing expression of PPARc, resulting
in terminal differentiation. We speculate that efatutazone,
as a highly potent PPARc agonist, was able to activate
even the very low levels of PPARc expressed in this
patient’s myxoid liposarcoma sufficiently to induce terminal differentiation of the tumor cells. Furthermore, it is
unlikely that there was any combined anticancer efficacy
with pravastatin, because the patient had a PR before
starting pravastatin.
In addition to 1 sustained PR, demonstration of
prolonged SD occurred in 10 patients (37%). Importantly, disease stabilization was observed in the diverse tumor histologies accrued to this phase 1 trial, suggesting a
benefit of PPARc agonism across tumor types. PPARc
and RXR expression frequencies may predict clinical benefit for efatutazone treatment. The product of the percentage of cells that express PPARc and RXR may be the best
classifier, but classifiers that include expression levels and/
or direct measures of coexpression should also be evaluated. These data, although preliminary, fit with the proposed mechanism of action of PPARc agonists.
Subsequent validation of PPARc and RXR expression frequency as a predictive marker is warranted in large trials.
Finally, preclinical data with PPARc agonists as single agents most often demonstrate disease stabilization,
which was also primarily observed in this phase 1 study.
Significant tumor regression is typically seen in combination with other anticancer agents, including traditional
cytotoxic and newer molecularly targeted therapies. For
this reason, several disease-specific trials of efatutazone in
combination with other agents have been initiated.
