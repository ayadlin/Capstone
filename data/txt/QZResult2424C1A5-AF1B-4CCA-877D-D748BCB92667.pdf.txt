BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder in patients with cancer has implications for outcomes. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of the type and timing of substance use on outcomes in elderly Medicare recipients with advanced prostate cancer.
METHODS: This was an observational cohort study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked data
from 2000 to 2009. Among men who were diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer between 2001 and 2004, we identified those
who had a claim for substance use disorder in the year before cancer diagnosis, 1 year after cancer diagnosis, and an additional 4
years after diagnosis. The outcomes investigated were use of health services, costs, and mortality. RESULTS: The prevalence of substance use disorder was 10.6%. The category drug psychoses and related had greater odds of inpatient hospitalizations (odds ratio
[OR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-2.8), outpatient hospital visits (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.9-3.6), and emergency room visits (OR,
1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4). Substance use disorder in the follow-up phase was associated with greater odds of inpatient hospitalizations
(OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.8-2.2), outpatient hospital visits (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.7-2.4), and emergency room visits (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-2.1). Compared with men who did not have substance use disorder, those in the category drug psychoses and related had 70% higher costs,
and those who had substance use disorder during the follow-up phase had 60% higher costs. The hazard of all-cause mortality was
highest for patients in the drug psychoses and related category (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7) and the substance use disorder in
treatment phase category (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7). CONCLUSIONS: The intersection of advanced prostate cancer and substance use disorder may adversely affect outcomes. Incorporating substance use screening and treatments into prostate cancer care

INTRODUCTION
The number of Americans aged >65 years is expected to double between 2000 and 2050. Because prostate cancer incidence increases exponentially with advancing age, there may be a surge in the number of older patients with prostate cancer,1 which will pose a challenge to our health care system. Like most elderly patients, those with prostate cancer likely will
acquire a higher number of maladies, both physical and psychosocial, with advancing age. Substance use disorder is an important comorbidity. An estimated 23.9 million individuals in the United States were current drug users in 2012.2 Prescription drug use is a recent trend in substance use in the United States and is now the second most common form of
illegal substance use.2 The exact prevalence of substance use disorder in the elderly is uncertain. However, estimates indicate that, by 2020, there will be approximately 4.5 million older adults with substance use disorder.3,4 Health problems
related to substance use disorder can reach unprecedented levels in the Baby Boomer generation as it reaches Medicare eligibility. For the first time, compared with younger adults, the proportion of older adults seeking treatment for substance
use disorder is on the rise.5
Despite these trends, the issue of substance use disorder remains understudied in cancer treatment,6 and patients’
alcohol and drug use assessments continue to be sketchy.7 Advanced prostate cancer care involves combinations of drugs,
surgery, radiation therapy, and palliative care.8 Many patients with advanced prostate cancer experience cancer-related
pain and impaired outcomes.9,10 The intersection of aging and advanced disease stage may exacerbate the potential for
substance use, leading to adverse outcomes.3,6,11-14 The objective of this study was to analyze the prevalence and modifying effects of substance use disorder on the use of health services, the cost of care, and mortality in elderly, fee-for-service

Medicare patients with advanced prostate cancer. We
hypothesized that the timing and the type of substance use
disorder would have varying effects on outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data

The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-Medicare data are the linkage of 2 large,
population-based data sources and provide detailed information about Medicare beneficiaries with cancer. The
SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute collects
data on cancer incidence, treatment, and mortality from
16 SEER sites and encompasses 26% of the US population. Of individuals aged 65 years diagnosed with
cancer who are enrolled in SEER registries, 93% have a
match in Medicare enrollment records.15
Study Cohort

For this retrospective case-control study, we used SEERMedicare–linked data to create a cohort of men aged 66
years who were diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer
between 2001 and 2004. The local institutional review
board approved this study. Patients with advanced prostate cancer were identified from the SEER Patient Entitlement and Diagnosis Summary (PEDSF) file by selecting
regional or distant codes for the variable summary stage
2000 (summ2k1). The summary stage variable is derived
from collaborative stages for 2004 and later and, before
that, from extent of disease and is used in most SEER publications.16 We excluded men who were aged <66 years at
the time of diagnosis to ensure there were sufficient claims
for medical care before the diagnosis of prostate cancer,
because these claims were necessary to adjust for prediagnosis comorbidity. With the date of prostate cancer diagnosis as the anchor, we defined the following phases of
care: the prediagnosis phase is defined as the year before
prostate cancer diagnosis, the cancer treatment phase is the
1-year period after prostate cancer diagnosis, and the
follow-up phase is the period up to 4 years beyond the
treatment phase.
Type of Substance Use Disorder

The key independent variable in our analyses was substance use disorder. Substance use disorder was defined
using International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition
(ICD-9) codes 291.xx (alcoholic psychosis and related),
292.xx (drug psychoses and related), 303.xx (alcohol dependence syndrome), 304.xx (drug dependence), and
305.xx (nondependent use of drugs). Among our cohort
of patients with advanced prostate cancer, we identified
Cancer

those who had at least 1 Medicare inpatient or outpatient
claim for any of these codes.
Timing of Substance Use Disorder

We created 3 exclusive categories based on the time that
substance use disorder was identified: the prediagnosis
phase, the treatment phase, and the follow-up phase.
Outcomes

The main outcomes of our study were the use of health
services, the cost of care, and mortality. The SEERMedicare–linked data yield information on inpatient hospitalization, outpatient hospital visits (including emergency room [ER] visits), physician or provider services,
durable medical equipment, home health services, skilled
nursing facility use, and hospice care. For this study, we
defined health service use as the number of inpatient hospitalizations, outpatient hospital visits, and ER visits. We
operationalized the cost of care as reimbursements
received from Medicare.17-19 Total costs were calculated
as the sum of reimbursements from inpatient hospitalizations, outpatient hospital visits, physician or provider
services, durable medical equipment, home health services, and hospice care. Using the SEER PEDSF file, we
obtained all-cause mortality data reported by both SEER
and Medicare. For SEER-reported mortality, we obtained
the date of death using the SEER month of death and the
SEER year of death. Because SEER does not report the
day of death, we assigned the middle of the month (ie, the
15th) as the day of death. For Medicare-reported mortality, the Medicare day, month, and year of death yielded
the date of death. A patient was coded as dead if SEER
and/or Medicare reported that the patient had died. The
time to death was calculated as the time between prostate
cancer diagnosis and death. We censored those patients
who were alive at the end of 5-year follow-up. The
variable SEER cause-specific death classification was used to
establish whether the death was prostate cancer-specific.
Covariates

From the PEDSF file, we used sociodemographic characteristics, disease severity, medical comorbidity, and type
of prostate cancer treatment to adjust our measures of
association. The Elixhauser comorbidity index was
derived using Medicare inpatient claims for the 1-year
period before prostate cancer diagnosis.20 The procedure
codes helped identify prostate cancer treatments from
Medicare claims and lead to following the exclusive treatment categories: surgery, radiation therapy, multimodal
therapy, and no treatment/watchful waiting.

Statistical Analysis

First, we tested for differences in the demographic and
clinical characteristics of patients with and without substance use disorder from our cohort of elderly patients
with advanced prostate cancer using t tests and chi-square
tests, as appropriate. For assessing health service use, negative binomial models were used.21 The dependent variables were the number of total inpatient hospitalizations,
outpatient hospital visits, and ER visits. To analyze the
association of substance use disorder with the cost of care,
we used a 2-part model. The first part consisted of logistic
regression to model the odds of incurring any cost. For
the second part, we used nonzero costs to model the association between substance use and cost using a generalized
linear model with log-link and gamma distribution variance function.21 For analyzing the association between
substance use disorder and mortality, we used Cox regression models. We used 3 sequential sets of models to study
the effect of substance use disorder on health service use,
cost of care, and mortality. In Model 1 we estimated the
unadjusted association of substance use disorder with outcomes. In Model 2, we adjusted for sociodemographic
attributes and Elixhauser comorbidity score.20,22 The type
of treatment for prostate cancer may affect outcomes; however, in our assessment of the relation between substance
use disorder and outcome, treatment assignments were
nonrandom. To minimize the bias caused by type of prostate cancer treatment, we used propensity score analysis.
Using multinomial logistic regression, we estimated the
propensity of receiving a particular prostate cancer treatment for each patient as a function of demographic and
clinical characteristics.23 We compared the t statistics for
these covariates before and after adjusting with the propensity score to observe the extent to which the different prostate cancer treatment groups matched. In Model 3, we
used type of treatment and the propensity score as additional covariates. In all our analyses, the reference category
was ‘those without a substance use disorder.’ We used the
software package Statistical Analysis System (SAS), version
9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) for data analysis.
RESULTS
We identified 14,277 fee-for-service Medicare patients
aged 66 years who were diagnosed with advanced-stage
prostate cancer between 2001 and 2004. From this
cohort, we identified 1509 patients (10.6%) who had a diagnosis of substance use disorder. The prevalence of substance use disorder was 1.8% in the pretreatment phase,
4.2% in the cancer treatment phase, and 4.6% in the
follow-up phase. Because the frequencies of 2 categories
3340

of substance use disorder—alcoholic psychosis and related
and drug dependence—were very small, we excluded them
from analysis. Therefore, the 3 major categories of substance use disorder that were used in our analysis were:
drug psychoses and related (n5136), alcohol dependence syndrome (n5142), and nondependent use of drugs (n51201).
In Table 1, we present the comparison between
patients with and without substance use disorder in our
cohort of men with advanced prostate cancer. Compared
with patients who did not have a substance use disorder,
those with a substance use disorder were younger (mean
age6standard deviation: 74.565.6 years vs 72.465.6
years) and included a greater proportion of African Americans (11.3% vs 17.6%). Those with substance use disorder were less likely to be married and to be from a
metropolitan area. The comparison of clinical characteristics indicated that those with substance use disorder had
more medical comorbidities and were more likely to have
a higher grade of prostate cancer compared with those
who did not have a substance use disorder. Finally, those
with a substance use disorder were more likely to have
received multimodal treatment and were less likely to
have undergone surgery alone compared with those who
did not have a substance use disorder.
Table 2 details the unadjusted outcomes across different categories of substance use disorder. The highest
proportion of patients in the drug psychoses and related category had used both inpatient services and outpatient
services. This group also had more inpatient and outpatient episodes, higher costs of care, higher all-cause mortality, and higher prostate cancer-specific mortality.
Conversely, those in the nondependent use of drug category
had higher ER use.
Association Between Substance Use Disorder
and Health Service Use
Inpatient hospitalizations

Compared with patients who did not have a substance use
disorder, all types of substance use categories were associated with higher inpatient use, as indicated in Table 3. In
particular, patients in the drug psychoses and related category had the most inpatient hospitalizations (odds ratio
[OR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-2.8). Those
who had substance use disorder during the follow-upphase had the most inpatient hospitalizations (OR, 2.0;
95% CI, 1.8-2.2).
Outpatient hospital visits

For outpatient hospital visits, we observed a pattern similar that for inpatient hospitalizations. Patients in the drug

ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using negative binomial models.
b
For all models, the reference category is those without a substance use disorder.

ER visits

Compared with patients who did not have a substance use
disorder, those in the drug psychoses and related category
had more ER visits (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.4). Patients
who had substance use disorder in the follow-up phase
had the most ER visits (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5-2.1).
Association Between Substance Use Disorder
and Cost of Care

Table 4 presents results from the 2-part models for cost of
care. Part 1 consists of logistic models in which the binary
dependent variable was any cost. Compared with the reference category of those without a substance disorder, those
with all types of substance use disorder had higher odds of
incurring any cost. In particular, the categories alcohol dependence syndrome and nondependent use of drugs had 4
times higher odds of incurring any cost. With regard to
timing, substance use disorder in the cancer treatment
phase had very high odds of incurring any cost (OR, 7.6;
95% CI, 4.7-12.0).
Part 2 consists of generalized linear model models
with log-link and gamma distribution for those with nonzero costs. Costs were higher for all types of substance use.
3342

Patients in the drug psychoses and related category had 70%
higher costs that those without a substance use disorder.
In addition, patients who had substance use disorder in
the follow-up phase had 60% higher costs compared with
those in the reference category.
Association Between Substance Use Disorder
and Mortality
All-cause mortality

Kaplan-Meier survival curves are provided in Figures 1
and 2. The log-rank statistic (P<.0001) indicates a difference in survival probabilities between various substance
use categories. Similarly, log-rank statistics indicate differences in the probability of survival according to the timing
of substance use disorder (P<.0001). The category of
drug psychoses and related had the highest hazard of allcause mortality (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7). The hazard
of mortality was lower for the category nondependent use of
drugs (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.96). The hazard of mortality also was high for substance use disorder in the pretreatment phase and in the treatment phase (hazard ratio:
1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.4] and 1.5 [95% CI, 1.3-1.7], respectively). We observed comparable results from an analysis

DISCUSSION
Our results provide important evidence regarding the
intersection of age, advanced prostate cancer, and substance use disorders. The prevalence of substance use disorder in our cohort of elderly fee-for-service Medicare
patients with advanced prostate cancer was 10.6%.
Another important observation was that the type and timing of substance use disorder had a strong association with
outcomes. Although it was not observed most frequently,
the category drug psychoses and related had the strongest
association with health service use, cost of care, and allcause mortality. In addition, substance use disorder identified after the diagnosis of prostate cancer had the highest
impact on health service use and cost of care. One possible
explanation is that pain and psychiatric comorbidities,
especially anxiety and depression, may influence subCancer

stance use during this period, and the interaction of these
factors ultimately may affect outcomes.24-26 Past and current substance use disorder in cancer patients can affect
their treatment and pain management and, thus, complicate the management of their disease.14,27 A study of substance use disorder in patients with chronic myelogenous
leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome indicated that lifetime cocaine use was associated with a 6-fold increased
risk of death.6
We note some limitations of our study. SEERMedicare–linked data have been used to study cancerrelated health services and costs, including for prostate
cancer.15,17,18 In our study, the sample consisted only of
men aged 66 years who lived in a SEER region and were
fee-for-service Medicare enrollees. The SEER-Medicare–
linked database does not include patients with Medicare
Advantage or Part C coverage. Furthermore, although the
age and sex distribution for individuals aged 66 years is
comparable to that of older adults in the United States,

challenges to the delivery of effective and efficient care.
Substance use disorder can be multifaceted and chronic;
therefore, it demands intense management similar to that
for cancer. There is an urgent need to identify the missed
opportunities for identifying and treating substance use
disorder among elderly men with prostate cancer. As a
first step, guidelines for prostate cancer care can incorporate screening for substance use disorder as a recommendation. Enhanced screening and coordinated care may
help with the early identification of elderly prostate cancer
patients who have substance use disorder, facilitate appropriate treatments and clinical management, and, thus lead
to improved outcomes.

the SEER regions have a higher proportion of nonwhite
individuals. Mortality rates derived from SEER data may
not be representative of national data on cancer mortality
rates.15 Administrative data have become an important
source of information for public health and health services
research but are subject to error.28 Our sample did not
capture men from the group ages 50 to 64 years, who also
are at risk for prostate cancer. We also did not include surrogate alcohol disorders as part of our substance use disorder group. Finally, substance use disorder may be
underreported in the Medicare claims, leading to conservative estimates of the association of substance use disorder
with health services use, costs of care and mortality.
In conclusion, substance use disorder among elderly
Medicare patients with prostate cancer can pose unique
