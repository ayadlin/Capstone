BACKGROUND: Although the combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP)
is considered standard therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), patterns of use and the impact of R-CHOP on survival in patients aged >80 years are less clear. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare
database was used to characterize presentation, treatment, and survival patterns in patients with DLBCL who were diagnosed
between 2002 and 2009. Chi-square tests compared characteristics and initial treatments among patients with DLBCL who
were aged >80 years and 80 years. Multivariable logistic regression models examined factors associated with treatment selection in patients aged >80 years; standard and propensity score-adjusted multivariable Cox proportional hazards models examined relationships between treatment regimen, treatment duration, and survival. RESULTS: Among 4635 patients with DLBCL,
1156 (25%) were aged >80 years. Patients aged >80 years were less likely to receive R-CHOP and more likely to be observed or
receive the combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (P<.0001 for both). Marital status, stage of
disease, disease site, performance status, radiotherapy, and growth factor support were associated with initial R-CHOP in
patients aged >80 years. In propensity score-matched multivariable Cox proportional hazards models examining relationships
between treatment regimen and survival, R-CHOP was the only regimen found to be associated with improved overall survival
(hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.62) and lymphoma-related survival (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: Although patients with DLBCL who were aged >80 years were less likely to receive R-CHOP, this
regimen conferred the longest survival and should be considered for this population. Further studies are needed to characterize the

INTRODUCTION
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed in the
Western world.1 It is also a disease of the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years2 and an incidence that rises
with increasing age.3 As the US population ages, the percentage of the population aged 65 years is projected to increase
from 14.8% in 2015 to 20.3% in 2030.4 Moreover, the number of individuals aged 80 years in the United States is
expected to increase from 11.5 million in 2010 to 12.8 million by 2020.5 An aging population coupled with an ageassociated increase in the incidence of DLBCL will lead to a greater need for the management of DLBCL in the very elderly, defined in the current study as individuals aged >80 years.
This expected increase in DLBCL in the very elderly warrants a determination of current treatment patterns and the
most effective management strategies for this population. Although to the best of our knowledge patients with DLBCL
who are aged >80 years are rarely included in studies, there is some evidence that standard-of-care treatment with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) as defined for younger patients should be

used for patients in this age group.6-13 The current study
sought to determine presentation, treatment, and survival
patterns in a large US population-based cohort of very elderly patients with DLBCL. Previous studies have identified DLBCL treatment disparities based on race and
insurance status,14,15 but to our knowledge age-related
disparities have not been studied as comprehensively. The
current study investigated whether there is a relation
between patient age and receipt of R-CHOP in a cohort
of patients with DLBCL who were all insured by Medicare. Specifically, we investigated factors associated with
treatment selection and examined the impact of age and
treatment regimen on overall survival (OS) and
lymphoma-related survival (LRS). We hypothesized that
patients aged >80 years were more likely to have comorbidities and poor performance status, and thus were more
likely to undergo initial observation. Among patients
receiving chemoimmunotherapy, we hypothesized that
patients aged >80 years were less likely to receive RCHOP. We also hypothesized that very elderly patients
who received R-CHOP would have superior OS and
LRS, even after controlling for demographic and clinical
factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) registry linked to Medicare claims data to examine elderly patients with DLBCL who were diagnosed
between 2002 and 2009. The National Cancer Institute
(NCI) SEER program collects and reports cancer incidence and survival data from US registries, covering
approximately 28% of the population as of 2014.16 Data
collected by SEER include patient demographics, tumor
histopathology, disease stage, primary site of tumor, initial treatment, and date of death.
The linkage of SEER with Medicare claims data
allows for the identification of specific treatments received
by elderly patients with cancer. Among individuals aged
65 years, 97% are eligible for Medicare and 93% who
are listed in SEER are linked to the Medicare enrollment
file.17 At the time of the current study, the SEERMedicare database included all Medicare-eligible individuals who appeared in SEER through 2009, and their
Medicare claims through 2010. Because the SEERMedicare database does not include patient identifiers,
this study did not require Institutional Review Board approval; however, a data use agreement was signed before
the current study was initiated.

Eligibility Criteria

Patients were eligible for analysis if they were diagnosed
with DLBCL between January 1, 2002 and December 31,
2009 and were aged 66 years at the time of diagnosis.
The minimum required age was 66 years to ensure that
patients had been enrolled in Medicare for 12 months
before diagnosis. DLBCL cases were identified using the
World Health Organization International Classification of
Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition histology codes 9680
and 9684.18 Exclusion criteria are shown in Figure 1.
Treatment regimens were limited for these analyses to
examine factors associated with the use of anthracyclines
(eg, doxorubicin); all first-line regimens received by
patients with DLBCL in the SEER-Medicare database
from 2002 through 2009 are listed in Supporting Information Table 1.

Patient Characteristics

Patients were stratified into two groups by age at diagnosis
(aged 66-80 years or aged >80 years). Self-reported race
was classified as white, African American, or “other”; in
SEER data, “other” most commonly refers to those of
Asian, Native American, Pacific Islander, or Alaska Native
ancestry.19 The SEER-Medicare data set uses information
from the 2000 US Census regarding the characteristics of
the census tract in which each patient lives (percentage of
residents living in poverty and percentage with only a high
school education) as surrogates for socioeconomic status,
as described in other SEER-Medicare studies.20-22 Other
demographic variables included in the current study were
sex, marital status, and type of geographical area (less
urban/rural, urban, or metropolitan).
Patients were also classified with regard to the following: Ann Arbor stage of disease (I/II, III/IV, or
unknown), primary site of disease (lymph node or extranodal), presence of B symptoms, receipt of radiotherapy
beyond 6 months after diagnosis, receipt of granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Healthcare Common Procedure
Coding System codes J1440, J1441, and J2820), performance status, NCI Comorbidity Index score (0, 1, or
2), and year of diagnosis. We classified performance status as poor if a patient had claims for any of the following:
hospice care, home health agency, skilled nursing facility,
oxygen, or wheelchair or related supplies. Similar claimsbased measures of performance status have been used in
other cancer studies.23-26 We calculated NCI Comorbidity Index scores using the Deyo adaptation of the Charlson Comorbidity Index to identify from Medicare claims

prednisone). Patients with the same claims who also
received rituximab were categorized as receiving R-CHOP
and R-CVP, respectively. The treatment duration for each
regimen was categorized as either 4 or >4 cycles. To
examine treatment-related toxicities, we searched inpatient
and emergency room claims from the date of treatment
initiation to 1 year past diagnosis. We identified
treatment-related toxicities using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes or Medicare Provider
Analysis and Review claims for the following conditions:
anemia, thrombocytopenia, febrile neutropenia, infections, cardiovascular disease, and any hospitalization.
For mortality classification, we used SEER date and
cause of death. Because SEER only reports the month and
year of diagnosis, the date of diagnosis for survival analyses was assigned as the 15th day of the reported month of
diagnosis. Patients were followed until death, enrollment
in a health maintenance organization, or last date of available Medicare claims. Two different survival endpoints
were examined: OS measured from the date of diagnosis
until death censored at the date of last follow-up and LRS
measured from the date of diagnosis until death from lymphoma censored at the date of last follow-up or death
from other causes. Because the SEER date of death was
only complete through December 31, 2009, patients
diagnosed in 2009 were excluded from the LRS analysis
to allow for a minimum follow-up of 1 year.
Statistical Analysis

Patients aged >80 years were compared with patients
aged 66 to 80 years using chi-square tests, which were also
used to compare R-CHOP toxicity in these two age
groups. Multivariable logistic regression models were used
to investigate the relations between patient characteristics
and initial observation or R-CHOP, and odds ratios
(ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Multivariable regression models were adjusted
for the following demographic and clinical variables: sex,
race, marital status, percentage in census tract living in
poverty, percentage in census tract with only a high school
education, type of geographical area, receipt of radiotherapy, growth factor support, stage of disease, primary site
of disease, presence of B symptoms, NCI Comorbidity
Index score, performance status, and year of diagnosis.
The goodness of fit of the logistic regression model was
assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and was found
to fit the data well.
Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to examine
the effectiveness of initial management strategies in
patients aged >80 years and the effect of age on OS and

LRS. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the effect
of treatments on OS and LRS. Cox models were adjusted
for the same variables described above. The global proportional hazards assumption was tested with the Wald test.
Proportional hazards assumptions for individual covariates were tested by assessing the Schoenfeld residuals. No
violations were detected. Sensitivity analyses were performed using propensity score methods to adjust for
imbalances in observable covariates between treatment
groups. Two propensity score adjustment methodologies
were applied: the first adjusted for propensity by matching
the R-CHOP and R-CVP groups with the observation
group and the second estimated the Cox proportional hazards models with inverse probability weighting.29,30
Because only one patient in the observation group
received growth factors, growth factor use was excluded in
the calculation of propensity scores. We set an a value of
.05 to determine statistical significance, and all P-values
were two-sided. Data were analyzed using SAS statistical
software (version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and
Stata 13 statistical software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

We identified a cohort of 4635 patients with DLBCL
including 1156 individuals (25%) who were aged >80
years at the time of diagnosis. In the cohort of patients
aged >80 years, the median age at the time of diagnosis
was 84 years and the mean age at the time of diagnosis was
85 years (standard deviation, 3 years). Characteristics of
patients in each age category are shown in Supporting Information Table 2. Compared with patients aged 80
years, those aged >80 years were more likely to be female,
widowed, live in a metropolitan area, have extranodal disease, have poor performance status, and be diagnosed after
2004; patients aged >80 years were less likely to live in a
lower socioeconomic status census tract, have stage III/IV
disease, have B symptoms, and be treated with radiotherapy or growth factors (all P<.05).
Treatment Selection

Compared with patients aged 66 to 80 years, those aged
>80 years were more likely to undergo observation and
were less likely to receive R-CHOP or CHOP (P<.0001)
(Table 1). Patients aged >80 years were more likely to
receive CVP or R-CVP (P<.0001). Among patients aged
>80 years, the initial receipt of R-CHOP was more commonly associated with being married (OR, 1.67; 95% CI,
1.04-2.69), having stage III/IV disease (OR, 1.36; 95%

2.87; 95% CI, 2.07-4.00) (see Supporting Information
Table 3). The initial receipt of R-CHOP was less commonly associated with extranodal disease (OR, 0.68; 95%
CI, 0.52-0.88) and poor performance status (OR, 0.64;
95% CI, 0.48-0.85). Patients with poor performance status were more likely to undergo observation (OR, 2.03;
95% CI, 1.46-2.84). Among patients aged >80 years who
underwent observation, approximately 80% had 1
comorbidity, 40% had a poor performance status, and
only 6% ultimately received radiotherapy (see online supporting information Table 4).
Survival and Treatment Toxicity

Kaplan-Meier survival curves shown in Figure 2 illustrate
that among patients initially treated with R-CHOP,
increasing age category was associated with decreased OS
and LRS. In patients aged >80 years, R-CHOP was associated with the longest OS and LRS (Fig. 3).
In multivariable Cox regression models, treatment
with R-CHOP for >4 cycles was associated with the most
favorable OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.330.58). Patients with stage III/IV disease experienced similar outcomes when treated with R-CVP for >4 cycles
(OS: HR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.16-0.65] and LRS: HR, 0.16
[95% CI, 0.05-0.57]) or R-CHOP for >4 cycles (OS:
HR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.25-0.62] and LRS: HR, 0.35 [95%
CI, 0.18-0.72]) (Table 2). Propensity score-adjusted HRs
1804

were similar in magnitude and statistical significance,
demonstrating that R-CHOP was the only regimen associated with improved OS (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33-0.62)
and LRS (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38-0.88) (see supporting
information Table 5; inverse probability weighting results
are not shown but are comparable). In comparison with
patients aged 66 to 80 years, those aged >80 years who
received R-CHOP had an increased risk of hospitalization
after treatment (74.9% vs 66.2%; P 5 .0001) and a
decreased risk of developing febrile neutropenia (5.6% vs
8.6%; P 5 .0250).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study of treatment patterns and outcomes in patients with DLBCL
who are aged >80 years is one of the most comprehensive
published to date, examining a large national cohort
treated with modern chemoimmunotherapy. An unexpected finding was that standard-of-care therapy with RCHOP was the most common initial management strategy among patients in this age group. These data indicate
the broad application of the best available evidence for
DLBCL to the very elderly population after the 2002 publication of a randomized controlled trial demonstrating
the superiority of R-CHOP over CHOP in patients aged
>60 years.31 However, approximately 25% of patients
aged >80 years had no initial therapy recorded within the
6 months after diagnosis. This is somewhat surprising
because <50% had a poor performance status and only

selection of this strategy.

very elderly patients with DLBCL to receive standard
treatment is associated with clinical factors, but also may
vary across demographic factors such as marital status.
This may reflect bias in the use of R-CHOP in very elderly
patients that is not based on clinical parameters. Our

observation that married patients were more likely to
receive R-CHOP might be explained by an assumption
that married patients enjoy a stronger support system,32
potentially leading to an increased willingness to undergo
and adhere to treatment. Indeed, several studies have
found an association between being married and
decreased mortality from cancer, including DLBCL.32-35
Our observation of a survival benefit among patients
initially treated with R-CVP is supported by previous
studies describing improved survival in elderly patients
with DLBCL who were treated with non-anthracyclinebased chemoimmunotherapy. Prior SEER-Medicare
studies found that among patients with DLBCL who were
aged >65 years, those who received non-anthracyclinebased chemoimmunotherapy had 3-year OS that was sim1806

ilar to that of patients who received anthracycline-based
chemotherapy without rituximab.36,37 The current study
adds to these findings by using a more recent SEERMedicare data set, controlling for performance status,
examining the effect of treatment duration on survival,
and delineating a specific chemotherapy regimen with
similar outcomes to R-CHOP in very elderly patients. We
also compared the toxicity of R-CHOP across age categories, and found that patients aged >80 years were less
likely to develop febrile neutropenia but were more likely
to be hospitalized after treatment. These findings may be
explained by the decreased use of intensive regimens and
worse performance status in very elderly patients,
respectively.
Although DLBCL treatment patterns and outcomes
in very elderly patients have not been well characterized
previously, there is some evidence from prior studies that
this group may benefit from standard treatment. A 1999
study found no difference in 5-year OS rates between
patients with DLBCL who were aged 80 years and
younger patients.6 A phase 2 study found that among
patients with DLBCL who were aged >80 years and had
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status of 0 to 2, low-dose R-CHOP conferred a survival
benefit and was well tolerated.7 A 2012 study demonstrating markedly improved survival in patients with DLBCL
who were aged 80 years in the rituximab era furthered
the notion that this population may benefit from chemoimmunotherapy.8 Recently, investigators compared
patients with DLBCL who were aged 80 years (40
patients) with those aged 20 to 79 years and found that
the former group was significantly less likely to be treated
with standard therapy and had significantly lower 1-year
OS and event-free survival.9 This study also found that
patients aged 80 years who received standard therapy
had significantly improved OS compared with those who
received no therapy, with the majority of untreated
patients dying of lymphoma. Another recent study found
that among 103 patients with DLBCL who were aged
75 years, those who completed chemotherapy had a 2year OS rate of 70%, compared with 28% for those
receiving incomplete chemotherapy and 21% for those
receiving supportive care.10 Other studies examining outcomes in very elderly patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma emphasized that standard treatments should be
considered in this population to improve survival.11-13 In
the current study, R-CHOP for >4 cycles produced a median OS of >6 years among patients aged >80 years and
yielded optimal survival, even after controlling for comorbid diseases, performance status, and stage of disease.

The strengths of the current study include a large
national cohort of patients with DLBCL with validated
SEER demographic and clinical information. It is important to note that using claims data only may overestimate
the percentage of patients who undergo observation,
because some of these patients may have instead received
oral chemotherapy or other regimens not captured by
their Medicare claims data. Thus, our use of patients
receiving observation as a reference group for the OS and
LRS Cox proportional hazards models provides a conservative estimate of the relative benefits of the treatment regimens. In contrast to our prior National Cancer Data Base
study concerning the diffusion of chemoimmunotherapy
over time,14 the current study contains more detailed information regarding the type of chemoimmunotherapy
given and provides a more complete capture of rituximab
use.
The current study also has limitations. First, we used
claims data to indirectly assess comorbidity, performance
status, and treatment, and we lacked direct clinical data
regarding treatment dose and referral to hospice care.
However, we did examine the effectiveness of standard
treatment versus abbreviated treatment cycles in our survival analysis, indicating that generally the receipt of more
cycles of therapy was associated with a better outcome. In
addition, we assumed that patients received prednisone
when their claims data contained the other components of
CHOP or CVP. This assumption may be inaccurate,
especially given the toxicities associated with prednisone
in elderly individuals. Despite these assumptions, the
findings of the current study regarding the outcomes associated with anthracycline-based versus non-anthracyclinebased chemoimmunotherapy regimens still hold. Of the
patients excluded from the current study population due
to death within 6 months of diagnosis, 48% were aged
>80 years. This represents 44% of the original population
of individuals aged >80 years. Thus, these results may not
be generalizable to patients aged >80 years with the most
advanced disease or the most severe comorbidity profile.
The results of the current study found that, in comparison with younger patients, those aged >80 years were
less likely to receive R-CHOP and were more likely to
undergo observation or receive R-CVP (P<.0001). RCHOP was associated with the best survival outcomes in
patients aged >80 years with all stages of disease, as has
been demonstrated in younger patients in randomized
controlled trials. These findings indicate that very elderly
patients with DLBCL who can tolerate R-CHOP should
be treated with this regimen. R-CVP also appeared to be
an effective treatment in patients with DLBCL who were

aged >80 years, particularly those with stage III/IV disease, and can be considered a viable alternative with similar outcomes to R-CHOP in very elderly patients with
advanced-stage DLBCL. These data also establish a rationale for comparing a non-anthracycline-based regimen
with R-CHOP in a randomized controlled trial involving
previously untreated elderly patients with DLBCL. Data
from ongoing studies examining the role of bendamustine
and rituximab in very elderly patients with DLBCL (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01990144 and NCT01234467) may
provide a foundation for such a trial in the future. Clinicians should consider functional status and comorbidities
when making treatment decisions for individual patients.
Further studies are needed to characterize the impact of
DLBCL treatment on quality of life and to determine
optimal R-CHOP dosing for very elderly patients.
