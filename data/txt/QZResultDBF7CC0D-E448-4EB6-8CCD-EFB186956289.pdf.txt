ABSTRACT
The molecular co-chaperone CDC37 is over-expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) cells, where it functions with HSP90 to regulate the activity of protein kinases in
multiple oncogenic signaling pathways that contribute towards hepatocarcinogenesis.
Disruption of these signaling pathways via inhibition of HSP90/CDC37 interaction is
therefore a rational therapeutic approach. We evaluated the anti-tumor effects of
celastrol, pristimerin, and two novel derivatives (cel-D2, and cel-D7) on HCC cell lines
in vitro and on orthotopic HCC patient-derived xenografts in vivo. All four compounds
preferentially inhibited viability of HCC cells in vitro, and significantly inhibited the
growth of three orthotopic HCC patient-derived xenografts in vivo; with the novel
derivatives cel-D2 and cel-D7 exhibiting lower toxicity. All four compounds also
induced cell apoptosis; and promoted degradation and inhibited phosphorylation of
protein kinases in the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. We
demonstrated that HSP90/CDC37 antagonists are potentially broad spectrum agents
that might be beneficial for treating the heterogeneous subtypes of HCC, either as
monotherapy, or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.

INTRODUCTION

therapeutic agent superior to sorafenib, which was FDA
approved as the standard of care for advanced HCC
[5]. Sorafenib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits
cell proliferation via disrupting the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway, and that blocks angiogenesis via inactivating the
functions of VEGFR and other growth factor receptors
[6]. However, sorafenib only modestly improves overall
survival of HCC patients by less than three months
[5]. Due to recent emergence of resistance to sorafenib
(7), second-line therapies targeting other key signaling
pathways in HCC, such as the EGFR, WNT, and PI3KAKT-mTOR pathways [7], are highly desirable.
The chaperone-kinome pathway is particularly
attractive as a therapeutic target in cancer [8, 9]. In this
pathway, the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) cooperates
with its molecular co-chaperone CDC37 to regulate the
folding, maturation, stabilization, and phosphorylation
of a wide array of protein kinases, which are important
mediators of signal transduction and cell growth in

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common
adult liver malignancy, is the seventh most common cancer
and the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death
worldwide [1]. Most of the burden (80%) of HCC is borne
in the developing world, such as Eastern and Southeast
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where the dominant risk
factor is chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV),
together with exposure with aflatoxin B1. In developed
countries, including North America, Europe, and Japan,
the dominant risk factor is chronic infection with hepatitis
C virus [2].
HCC has a poor prognosis, partly due to late
diagnosis of the disease and lack of effective therapeutic
options [3]. Most patients remain asymptomatic until the
disease is advanced. Although more than 50 drugs that
target different biomarkers or signaling pathways are in
clinical trials for HCC treatment [4], as yet there is no

human cancers [10]. HSP90 has been recognized as a
key facilitator of oncogene addiction and a promising
therapeutic target in cancers [11], with several HSP90
inhibitors in preclinical and clinical evaluation for cancer
therapy [12, 13]. Current HSP90 inhibitors interact with
the N-terminal ATP-binding pocket and block ATP binding
to stop the chaperone cycle, thereby leading to client
protein degradation [11]. Despite encouraging preclinical
efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors, clinical translation is likely
limited due to the activation of the heat shock transcription
factor HSF1 [14], which induces the expression of HSP70
and HSP23 to protect tumor cells from apoptosis [13-15].
On the contrary, targeting of the co-chaperone
CDC37 have several advantages over targeting HSP90
[10]. Firstly, it obviates the undesirable induction of the
anti-apoptotic heat shock response seen with HSP90
inhibition, and additionally inhibits the HSF-1 activity
and HSP70 expression [16, 17]. Secondly, CDC37 is the
key permissive factor in cell transformation caused by
oncogenic protein kinases [8, 10, 18]. Crystal structure
studies suggest that the central segment of CDC37
associates with the N-terminal ATPase domain of
HSP90 [19], whereas the N-terminal segment of CDC37
associates with its client protein kinases [20]. Many of
its client protein kinases are dysregulated or activated
in HCC, including Cdk4, EGFR, AKT, MEK1/2 and
Raf family proteins [21-24]. Thirdly, over-expression
of CDC37 has been reported in various cancers such as
prostate cancer [25], multiple myeloma [26], anaplastic
large cell lymphoma [27], acute myelocytic leukaemia
[28], and HCC [29]. In prostate epithelial cells, the
aberrant expression of CDC37 contributes towards
carcinogenesis by stabilizing and activating its client
protein kinases, thereby promoting cell proliferation and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

survival [30]. Lastly, CDC37 expression is increased in
proliferating tissues and is heavily expressed in certain
cancers (due to the increased need of over-expressed
protein kinases that mediate their growth); whereas most
normal tissues do not proliferate or appear to require
CDC37 [10, 31]. This specificity of CDC37 for malignant
cells potentially offers a greater therapeutic window for
CDC37-based therapeutics.
Given the contributory roles of multiple protein
kinases in hepatocarcinogenesis, we hypothesized that
disrupting the HSP90 and CDC37 chaperone complex
may achieve anti-tumor effects in HCC, by inducing
degradation and inhibiting phosphorylation of their client
proteins kinases [16, 32, 33]. We therefore evaluated the
recently identified HSP90/CDC37 antagonist, celastrol
[34], for its anti-tumor activity in HCC cell lines and
patient-derived xenografts. We additionally synthesized
three derivatives of celastrol and compared their safety
and anti-tumor activity profiles in HCC patient-derived
xenografts, providing a clinically relevant model for
evaluating the performance of these potential therapeutic
compounds.

RESULTS
Synthesis and characterization of celastrol
derivatives that disrupt HSP90/CDC37 complexes
The chemical structures of celastrol and its
derivatives are shown in Table 1. All chemical structures
were confirmed by analyses using 1H (Supplementary Fig.
1 for cel-D2; Supplementary Fig. 2 for cel-D7) and 13C

NMR (Supplementary Fig. 3 for cel-D2; Supplementary
Fig.4 for cel-D7), and high resolution mass spectrometry
(Supplementary Fig. 5 for cel-D2; Supplementary Fig. 6
for cel-D7).
To confirm that these derivatives of celastrol
retain the ability to disrupt HSP90/CDC37 interaction,
we first did Western blot analysis of HSP90 after
immunoprecipitation of CDC37 from HepG2 cell lysates,
which demonstrated that immunoprecipitation of CDC37
pulled down HSP90 as expected. Treatment of HepG2
cells for 6 hours with celastrol or its three derivatives
at 5 µM each decreased the amount of HSP90 in the
immunoprecipitated CDC37 complex. Our results showed
that HSP90 and CDC37 formed a complex in vitro and
that all four chemicals disrupted their direct interaction.

microscopic examination demonstrated greater toxicity
towards HCC cells compared to normal hepatocytes
(representative images for treatment with cel-D7 are
shown in Fig. 2B). Each of these compounds also induced
apoptosis in HCC cell lines (representative images for
Huh7 cells are shown in Fig. 2C). Our data indicate that
modification of the carboxylic acid group of celastrol
retained HSP90/CDC37 antagonist activity, as well as
anti-tumor activity in HCC cell lines. Notably, celastrol
and pristimerin, both with non-aromatic substituents,
show greatest activity against HCC cells, and are also
considerably more toxic against normal hepatocytes.
Cel-D2 and cel-D7, with aromatic phenyl substituents,
exhibited reduced activity against HCC cells; with cel-D7
being the least toxic against normal hepatocytes.

Celastrol and its derivatives preferentially
inhibited viability of HCC cells compared to
normal hepatocytes

Celastrol and its derivatives induced degradation
and inhibited phosphorylation of HSP90/CDC37
client protein kinases in HCC cell lines

To test our hypothesis that HSP90/CDC37
antagonists are feasible anti-tumor agents in the treatment
of HCC, we first tested their selective cytotoxicity against
HCC cells (HepG2, Huh7, and Hep3B) compared to
normal hepatocytes (Hu8114, Hu4175, and Hu8130,
obtained from three donors with non-diseased liver).
Western blot analysis confirmed that only HCC
cells express high levels of CDC37, whereas normal
hepatocytes express undetectable levels of CDC37 (Fig.
2A). Accordingly, treatment of these HCC cell lines and
normal hepatocytes with celastrol or its derivatives for 3
days showed greater inhibition of cell viability in HCC cell
lines compared to normal hepatocytes, with several folds
lower IC50s in HCC cell lines than in normal hepatocytes
for each compound (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 7). Light

To study the molecular events resulting from
treatment with celastrol and its derivatives, we detected
the levels and phosphorylation status of several HSP90/
CDC37 client protein kinases that are known to be highly
activated in HCC, including the Raf family proteins, AKT,
MEK1/2, CDK4, and EGFR. Treatment of HepG2, Huh7,
and Hep3B cells with celastrol and its derivatives for 6
hours reduced the protein levels and phosphorylation levels
of all the HSP90/CDC37 client protein kinases studied,
compared to DMSO control (Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Fig. 8). These effects were dose-dependent, with 10
µM concentration of each compound causing greater
reductions in expression and phosphorylation levels for
almost all protein kinases compared to treatment with 1
µM of each compound. EGFR was not detected in HepG2
cells, but showed decreased levels after treatment with
all compounds in Huh7 cells (with dose-dependence seen
only with pristimerin and cel-D7). CDC37 levels did not
change after treatment with any compound.

Celastrol and its derivatives inhibited growth of
orthotopic HCC patient-derived xenografts
We next evaluated the anti-tumor effects of celastrol
and its derivatives in orthotopic HCC patient-derived
xenografts. Tumors from three HCC patients (HCC1, HCC-2, and HCC-3) were confirmed to express high
levels of CDC37 compared to their matched non-tumor
liver tissues (Fig. 4A). Preliminary limited toxicity studies
in NSG mice suggested the maximum tolerate dose was 4
mg/Kg for celastrol; 1 mg/Kg for pristimerin; 8 mg/Kg for
cel-D2; and 8 mg/Kg for cel-D7. At these respective doses,
all four compounds did not result in significant toxicity
or any noticeable discomfort to the mice, suggesting
that these doses were well tolerated. We therefore used

interaction in HCC cells. HepG2 cells were incubated with
5 µM of each compound and the same volume of DMSO as
negative control for 6 hours. HSP90/CDC37 complex was then
pulled down by anti-CDC37 antibody in the cell lysates. AntiHSP90 antibody was used to detect the HSP90 protein in the
complex. The lysates were used to detect HSP90, CDC37, and
GAPDH (loading control).

these doses for treatment, which was initiated within one
week after orthotopic transplant of the xenografts stably
expressing the luciferase reporter gene.
Based on weekly monitoring of luciferase signal in
vivo, all four compounds significantly inhibited growth of
all three orthotopic HCC xenografts (compared to saline
treated controls) at the end of the 3-weeks treatment
period (Fig. 4B-D; Supplementary Fig. 9). Measurement
of final tumor volumes at the end of the treatment period
consistently showed that all compounds caused significant
reductions in tumor volumes in all three orthotopic HCC
xenografts (when each treatment group is separately
compared to saline control group) (Fig. 4E; P < 0.05).
On average across all three HCC xenografts, celastrol
reduced tumor volumes by 2-5 folds; pristimerin by 5-7

folds; cel-D2 by 1.5-3.5 folds; and cel-D7 by 1.8-3.2 folds.
Our in vivo data were consistent with our in vitro data,
with celastrol and pristimerin showing greater anti-tumor
activity than cel-D2 and cel-D7. Of note, tumor mass was
absent from one of five mice in the group with HCC-1
xenografts after celastrol treatment, and from one of five
mice in all three groups with HCC-1, HCC-2, or HCC-3
xenografts after pristimerin treatment.
In vivo toxicology analysis revealed that celastrol
and pristimerin caused slight decreases in the body weight
of treated mice, whereas cel-D2 and cel-D7 did not
affect body weight of treated mice (compared to saline
treated controls) (Fig. 4F and Supplementary Table 3A).
In addition, white blood cells were elevated by about
2.5-folds in the celastrol treatment group (16.32 ± 3.23 K/

µL) as compared to the saline control group (6.34 ± 2.34
K/µL). Correspondingly, mice treated with celastrol have
enlarged spleens (Supplementary Table 3A). We also noted
that pristimerin treatment significantly elevated the blood
AST and ALT level as compared to saline control group
(Supplementary Table 3B), suggesting that pristimerin
may negatively impact liver functions. However, cel-D2
and cel-D7 treatments did not result in any significant
changes in body weight or blood chemistries. These in
vivo observations were consistent with our in vitro data
that celastrol and pristimerin are more toxic to normal

hepatocytes.

Celastrol and its derivatives induced apoptosis
and degradation of HSP90/CDC37 associated
client protein kinases in orthotopic HCC patientderived xenografts
Similar to our in vitro observations with HCC cell
lines, all four compounds induced cell apoptosis in all the
orthotopic HCC xenografts when harvested tumors were
analyzed by TUNEL staining (representative images for

HCC-3 xenografts are shown in Fig. 5). Celastrol and
pristimerin showed more extensive staining of apoptotic
cells than cel-D2 and cel-D7, consistent with the greater
anti-tumor activities observed with the former two
compounds. Western blot analysis of HSP90/CDC37 client
protein kinases demonstrated that all four compounds
induced degradation and inhibited phosphorylation of most
of the studied kinases (representative images for HCC3 are shown in Fig. 6). Pristimerin in particular showed
strongest effects on AKT, MEK1/2 and EGFR, whereas
celastrol showed strongest effect on B-Raf. CDC37
expression in these xenografts were maintained (compared
to original HCC tumor levels), and expression levels were
unaffected by treatment with all four compounds.

other) pathways simultaneously, offering the benefit of
treating a larger percentage of HCC patients without the
need to administer chemotherapeutic cocktails that would
also increase side effects.
An additional benefit resulting from simultaneous
inhibition of a wide array of oncogenic kinase pathway
is the potential to help overcome drug resistance that
are often associated with the activation of one or more
of these pathways. For example, acquired drug resistance
to sorafenib (targeting angiogenesis and Raf/MEK/ERK
signaling pathways) have been attributed to the activation
of PI3K/AKT and EGFR [41, 42]; adaptive drug resistance
to EGFR-targeted therapies have been associated with
activation of PI3K/AKT pathway [43]; whereas therapies
targeting AKT/mTOR leads to Raf/MEK/ERK pathway
activation through a PI3K-dependent feedback loop
[44]. Thus, the use of HSP90/CDC37 antagonists either
by themselves or in combination therapy with other
pathway-specific inhibitors may potentially circumvent
the development of acquired drug resistance by inhibiting
multiple pathways simultaneously, and at the same time
increase drug sensitivity. This is particularly beneficial
for HCC, which is highly resistant to currently used
chemotherapeutic drugs, making successful treatment a
clinical challenge.
In our attempt to develop new and more efficacious
derivatives of celastrol, we synthesized a total of seven
derivatives (cel-D1 to cel-D7, with cel-D5 being
pristimerin) by introducing different substituents
(aromatic or non-aromatic) via amide or ester bond to the
chemically active carboxylic acid group of celastrol. The
structures and IC50s of all seven derivatives are shown in
Supplementary Table 1. We selected celastrol, pristimerin,
cel-D2 and cel-D7 for further studies based on their
greater preferential activities against HCC cells compared
to normal hepatocytes. Among them, our data suggest that
celastrol and pristimerin have greater anti-tumor efficacy
but also greater toxicity both in vitro and in vivo (observed
as lower IC50 to normal hepatocytes in vitro and greater
weight loss in vivo); whereas cel-D2 and cel-D7 have
slightly reduced anti-tumor efficacy and reduced toxicity
(observed as higher IC50 to normal hepatocytes in vitro
and absence of weight loss in vivo). Celastrol treatment
also caused enlarged spleen and elevated white blood
cells; whereas pristimerin treatment caused significant
liver impairment (elevated AST and ALT level). At the
molecular level, celastrol and pristimerin showed greatest
inhibitory effects on the client protein kinases, which may
underlie their greater apoptotic effects to both malignant
and normal hepatocytes. Our limited structure-activityrelationship (SAR) study suggests that modifications of
the carboxylic acid group of celastrol do not drastically
affect their ability to disrupt HSP90/CDC37 inhibition;
however, derivatives with aromatic phenyl substituents
(cel-D2 and cel-D7) appear to induce less marked
apoptosis and may therefore be less toxic to normal cells

DISCUSSION
HSP90 and its co-chaperone CDC37 are key factors
in the chaperone-kinome pathway that is recognized
to play permissive roles in the oncogenesis of multiple
types of tumors, including HCC [10]. The inhibition
of HSP90 or CDC37 alone (by RNA interference or
by small molecule inhibitors of HSP90) has shown
encouraging anti-tumor effects in cell-based studies of
multiple tumors, which are associated with enhanced
degradation and decreased phosphorylation of oncogenic
HSP90/CDC37 client protein kinases [11, 16, 17, 33].
Based on the established role of these client protein
kinases in hepatocarcinogenesis, we hypothesized that
the direct disruption of HSP90 interaction with CDC37
by the small molecule celastrol would achieve desirable
anti-tumor effects. Indeed, celastrol and three of its
derivatives were successfully shown to disrupt HSP90
and CDC37 interaction in HCC cells; to inhibit the growth
of secondary HCC cell lines in vitro; and to inhibit the
growth of orthotopic HCC patient-derived xenografts in
vivo.
The observed anti-tumor activities of celastrol
and its derivatives both in vitro and in vivo promoted
degradation and decreased phosphorylation of protein
kinases that are known to be highly activated in HCC
cells, such as Raf family proteins, AKT, MEK1/2,
CDK4, and EGFR. This ability to simultaneously disrupt
multiple oncogenic signaling pathways suggests that
these HSP90/CDC37 antagonists are potentially broad
spectrum inhibitors that would be beneficial for treating
the heterogeneous subtypes of HCC. In particular, the
Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways are
both critically involved in hepatocarcinogenesis [3538]. Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is activated in more than
50% of HCC [39], whereas PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
is activated in about 40-50% of HCC [23, 35, 40]. The
inhibition of both these pathways by molecules specifically
targeting each pathway have successfully suppressed
HCC growth [35, 36, 38]. Our results suggest that HSP90/
CDC37 antagonists can effectively inhibit both these (and

compared to derivatives with non-aromatic alkyl groups.
The clinical translation of celastrol and pristimerin may be
limited due to their toxicity, and further pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics evaluation of cel-D2 and cel-D7
are warranted before determining their suitability for use
in human patients. It is likely that detailed SAR studies
may lead to the identification of other derivatives which
may have an improved therapeutic window.
The use of orthotopic patient-derived xenografts
in our study provides a fairly high predictive value
of the response of HCC patients to celastrol and its
derivatives. The human origin of these xenografts more
accurately reflect the response rates; in fact, responses to
chemotherapy in patient-derived xenografts have been
reported to resemble the response rates of monotherapy
in clinical trials [45]. Orthotopic models have also been
shown to be more predictive of a patient’s response to
chemotherapy [46]. Our xenografts are established from
HCC patients with over-expression of CDC37, which
we confirmed to be maintained in the xenografts. In our
experience, we observed that not all HCC patient tumors
can establish xenografts in immunocompromised mice;
of those that successfully engrafted, the expression of
CDC37 and its related protein kinases were found to
be consistently high, suggesting that these proteins and
their associated signaling pathways are critical factors in
allowing engraftment. The maintenance of these molecular
features in our patient-derived xenografts is especially
relevant in the evaluation of the efficacy of celastrol
and its derivatives. Thus, in future preclinical or clinical
studies of HSP90/CDC37 antagonists, it is recommended
to screen tumor models or patients for the expression of
CDC37 and its client protein kinases before considering
treatment with these agents.
In summary, we demonstrated that HSP90/CDC37
antagonists are promising agents for the treatment of HCC,
which are typically resistant to standard chemotherapeutic
agents. They are potentially broad spectrum agents,
being able to simultaneously disrupt multiple oncogenic
pathways that are critical in development of the
heterogeneous subtypes of HCC. Thus, HSP90/CDC37
antagonists may be effective as monotherapy or as
combination therapy with other conventional agents,
with the additional potential to sensitize HCC cells and
circumvent the development of acquired resistance to
these agents. Our data suggest that celastrol in itself might
be too toxic for clinical use, but that two of its derivatives
with reduced toxicity might be considered for further
preclinical evaluation or structure-activity optimization.
We conclude that targeting the chaperone-kinome pathway
is a promising approach for the treatment of HCC.

Synthesis of celastrol derivatives
Celastrol and pristimerin were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Two other celastrol
derivatives, cel-D2 and cel-D7, were synthesized
using celastrol as the starting material, using chemicals
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Synthetic schemes for
cel-D2 and cel-D7 are shown in Supplementary Fig.
10. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using
the Varian 300 MHz or 400 MHz magnetic resonance
spectrometer. High resolution mass spectrometric (MS)
analyses of the compounds were performed at the Mass
Spectrometry Facility at Stanford University. For cel-D2,
celastrol (20.5 mg, 0.045 mmol) was dissolved in
dimethylformamide (2 mL), DIPEA (20 µL, 0.12 mmol)
and PyBOP (50 mg, 0.096 mmol) were then added into the
solution, followed by 2-phenylethylamine (10 µL, 0.079
mmol). After stirring for 24 hours at room temperature,
deionized water (15 mL) was added and the reaction
mixture was extracted by ethyl acetate (3 X 15 mL).
The combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO4,
filtered and concentrated via a rotary evaporator to yield a
dark red oil. Reversed phase (RP)-HPLC (Dionex HPLC
System; Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) using a C18
column (Phenomenax, 5 μm, 4.6 x 250 mm or Dionex, 5
μm, 21.2 x 250 mm) and an acetonitrile-water gradient
mobile phase (flow of 1 or 12 mL/minutes) afforded
cel-D2 as an orange solid (17.2 mg, 68.0% yield), with
m/z 554.3621 (M+H).
For cel-D7, celastrol (20.2 mg, 0.045 mmol) was
dissolved in dimethylformamide (2 mL), followed by
addition of sodium bicarbonate (21.5 mg, 0.256 mmol)
and benzyl bromide (8 µL, 0.067 mmol). After stirring for
24 hours at room temperature, deionized water (15 mL)
was added and the reaction mixture was extracted by ethyl
acetate (3 X 15 mL). The combined organic extracts were
dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated via a rotary
evaporator to yield a dark red oil. RP-HPLC purification
on a C18 column with an acetonitrile-water gradient
afforded cel-D7 as an orange solid (14.0 mg, 57.4% yield),
with m/z 541.3306 (M+H).
Detailed characterization data of cel-D2 and cel-D7
are provided in Supplementary Figs. 1-6.

a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The HepG2 and
Hep3B cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) in 2008. The Huh7 cell
line was a gift from Dr. Mark Kay (Stanford University,
CA) in 2003. All cell lines were last authenticated in June
2013, by the short tandem repeat profiling method at the
Johns Hopkins Genetic Resources Core Facility. And
all cell lines used were tested regularly for mycoplasma
contamination.
Cryopreserved normal human hepatocytes and all
special media and plates needed for their culture were
received from CellzDirect/Invitrogen (Durham, NC).
Characteristics of the three hepatocyte lots are shown in
Supplementary Table 2A. Thawing and culture of primary
hepatocytes were as described previously [47].

that inhibits cell growth by 50%) were calculated as an
estimate of the cytotoxic effects of the four compounds.
Three independent experiments were done, each in
triplicates.

Apoptosis analysis
Terminal dUTP-mediated nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) assays (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) were
performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, HepG2 cells were seeded in 8-chamber BD tissue
culture slides (BD Bioscience Labware, Bedmord, MA) at
10% confluency. Celastrol or its derivatives were added to
the culture medium at final concentrations of 5 µM. After
6 hours incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS,
and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 25 minutes.
Fixed cells were washed twice in PBS with 0.1% Triton
X-100, and then incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture
for 60 minutes at 37°C. After washing with 2xSSC, slides
were immersed in PBS (with 5 µg/ml DAPI) for 5 minutes
in the dark, and then washed with PBS. Fluorescence
labeling was visualized and photographed (100x
magnification) with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon
Eclipse 80i, Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and with
a digital camera (Nikon DXM1200f, Nikon Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan). For TUNEL staining of the patient-derived
xenografts, 6-µm tissue sections were stained using the
ApopTag Peroxidase in Situ Oligo Ligation Apoptosis
Detection Kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Protein extraction, Western blotting, and coimmunoprecipitation
Total protein was extracted from tissues or
harvested cells using T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction
Reagent (Pierce; Rockford, IL), and protein concentration
was determined with BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce,
Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of protein (10 μg)
were electrophoresed on 4% to 12% polyacrylamide
gels (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA), and transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 10%
nonfat milk for at least 1 hour, and probed with primary
antibodies against CDC37 (ab61773) from Abcam
(Cambridge, MA); HSP90 (SC-59577), B-Raf (SC-166),
GAPDH (SC-365062) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA); CDK4 (2906), EGFR (2232), MEK1/2
(9122), AKT (9272), A-Raf (4432), C-Raf (9422),
p-A-Raf (s299, 4431), p-B-Raf (s445,2696), p-C-Raf
(s289/296/301, 9431), p-AKT (s473, 4058s), p-MEK1/2
(s217/221, 9121) from Cell Signaling ( Danvers, MA).
The specific proteins were detected with HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa
Cruz, CA) and SuperSignal West Pico or West Femto
Maximum Sensitivity substrate from Pierce (Rockford,
IL). Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using Protein
A/G agarose (SC-2003, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions, with
anti-CDC37 antibody (ab61773, Abcam, Cambridge, MA)
for pull-down, and anti-HSP90 antibody (SC-59577, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for immunoblotting.

Establishment of orthotopic HCC patient-derived
xenografts
HCC tissues were collected from HCC patients who
had undergone liver resection as part of their treatment.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at Stanford University for the use of human subjects
in medical research, and informed consent was obtained
from each patient prior to liver resection. Animal studies
were carried out in compliance with Federal and local
institutional rules for the conduct of animal experiments.
Characteristics of the three HCC patients are
shown in Supplementary Table 2B. HCC specimens were
mechanically and enzymatically dissociated in HBSS
containing 0.1% collagenase, 0.01% hyaluronidase and
0.002% deoxyribonuclease at 37°C to obtain single
cell suspensions [48]. Cells were then passed through
a 70-μm ﬁlter, centrifuged at 100 g for 10 minutes and
resuspended in Freezing Medium (FBS containing 10%
DMSO) for storage at -80°C overnight, and transferred
to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. Thawed cells
were suspended in BEGM medium mixed with 50%
Matrix Matrigel (Becton Dickinson; Franklin Lakes,
NJ) and injected subcutaneously into 4 week old (20 g

Cell viability assay
Test compounds were added at desired final
concentrations, and further incubated for 72 hours
before cell viability was assessed using CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega; Madison,
Wisconsin) as previously described [47] . The 50%

(Nod-SCID-Gamma; NSG). Mating pairs of NSG mice
were originally purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar
Harbor, MA), and bred according to approved institutional
protocols. Once the subcutaneous xeongrafts reached
1 cm in diameter, they were harvested for dissociation
as described above. Single cell suspensions were then
transduced with self-inactivating lentivirus carrying an
ubiquitin promoter driving a trifusion reporter gene,
which harbors a bioluminescence (Luc2), a fluorescence
(egfp), and a positron emission tomography reporter gene
(ttk) at a multiplicity of infection of 5 [49]. High titer
lentiviral vectors were produced using a modified version
of a previous protocol [50]. Tumor cells were stained with
Pacific BlueTM anti-mouse CD45, Pacific BlueTM antimouse H-2Kd, and Pacific BlueTM anti-mouse CD31
(BioLegend; San Diego, CA). Stable expressors were
isolated by sorting as eGFP positive and Pacific Blue
negative cells performed on a BD FACSAria (Becton
Dickinson; Franklin Lakes, NJ).
To generate orthotopic HCC patient-derived
xenografts, single tumor cells labeled with luciferase gene
were suspended in BEME medium containing 50% Matrix
Matrigel, and then subcutaneously injected into 4–8
week old male NSG mice (20-25 g body weight). Tumor
development was monitored daily. Once the subcutaneous
xenograft reached 1 cm in diameter, it was removed and
cut into 2 mm3 pieces and surgically implanted into the
left lobe of the liver of another group of 6 weeks old NSG
mice [49]. Tumor growth was monitored once a week
using the Xenogen IVIS in vivo imaging system (Caliper
Life Sciences, Hopkinton, CA). Firefly luciferase imaging
was acquired with D-Luc saline solution (150 mg/Kg body
weight) via intraperitoneal injection.

Animal treatment
derivatives

with

celastrol

and

were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for
evaluation of cell morphology and apoptosis as described
above.

In vivo toxicity studies of celastrol and its
derivatives
BALB/cJ mice (6-8 weeks old) were randomized
into groups (n = 4 each) to be intravenously injected with
saline only (control); celastrol (4 mg/Kg); pristimerin (1
mg/Kg); cel-D2 (8 mg/Kg); or cel-D7 (8 mg/Kg) (each
diluted in saline) three times per week. At the end of the
administration period, mice in each group were euthanized
and their bodies and harvested organs were weighed. In
addition, blood was collected for whole blood complete
blood counts (CBC) and plasma chemistry analysis at
the Stanford Animal Diagnostic Laboratory. The normal
ranges of CBC and plasma chemistry panel are obtained
from the Mouse Phenome Database of the Jackson
Laboratory.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were done using the SPSS
version 15.0 software package (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL).
Statistical significance was determined by independent
samples t-test. P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 were considered
statistically significant and highly significant, respectively.

cel-D7 (8 mg/Kg) (each diluted in saline) three times per
week. Tumor growth was monitored weekly using the
Xenogen IVIS in vivo imaging system, and growth curves
were plotted using average bioluminescence within each
group. Body weight was also measured weekly. After 3
weeks treatment, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors
and normal livers harvested. Tumor size was measured
with digital calipers and tumor volume was calculated
using the formula π/6 x larger diameter x [smaller
diameter]2. Liver and tumor tissues were fixed in formalin
and embedded with paraffin. The 6-µm tissue sections
