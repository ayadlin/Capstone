BACKGROUND: Sunitinib and sorafenib are tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have important antitumor activity in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Hypothyroidism constitutes a commonly reported side effect of both drugs, and
particularly of sunitinib. The objective of this analysis was to investigate whether the occurrence of hypothyroidism
during treatment with sunitinib and sorafenib affects the outcome of patients with mRCC. METHODS: Eighty-seven
consecutive patients with mRCC who were to receive treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib were included in a prospective analysis. Thyroid function was assessed in each patient every 4 weeks during the first 2 months of treatment
and every 2 to 4 months thereafter. Assessment included serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), tri-iodthyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4). Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as an increase in TSH above the upper
limit of normal (>3.77 lM/mL) with normal T3 and T4 levels. RESULTS: Subclinical hypothyroidism was evident in 5
patients at baseline and occurred in 30 patients (36.1%) within the first 2 months after treatment initiation. There was
a statistically significant correlation between the occurrence of subclinical hypothyroidism during treatment and the
rate of objective remission (hypothyroid patients vs euthyroid patients: 28.3% vs 3.3%, respectively; P < .001) and the
median duration of survival (not reached vs 13.9 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval,
0.14-0.85; P ¼ .016). In multivariate analysis, the development of subclinical hypothyroidism was identified as an independent predictor of survival (hazard ratio, 0.31; P ¼ .014). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that hypothyroidism may serve as a predictive marker of treatment outcome in patients with mRCC. Thus, the interpretation of
hypothyroidism during treatment with sunitinib and sorafenib as an unwanted side effect should be reconsidered.

Antiangiogenic agents have led to clinically meaningful advances in the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Among these novel therapeutic agents, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) sunitinib and
sorafenib were the first to be approved for the treatment of mRCC. Both inhibit tyrosine kinases of growth factor receptors, the most important of which are the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), the platelet-derived
growth factor receptor (PDGFR), the stem cell factor KIT receptor (a cytokine receptor), the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3
(FLT3) receptor, and the protein product of the ret oncogene.1,2 Compared with interferon-alpha, first-line treatment
with sunitinib reportedly improved the objective remission rate (ORR) significantly (31% vs 6%; P < .001) along with
progression-free survival (PFS) (11 months vs 5 months; P < .001).3 On the basis of these findings, sunitinib has been
considered the new standard first-line treatment in mRCC. Sorafenib, apart from being a VEGFR TKI and a PDGFR
TKI, also inhibits RAF, an important member of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Signal transduction mediated by this pathway is important for tumor progression.4 In patients who fail on immunotherapy, sorafenib reportedly

provided a statistically significant benefit in PFS compared with placebo (5.5 months and 2.8 months, respectively; P < .01).5 Thus, sorafenib is the recommended
standard of care in this patient population.6
Common toxicities reported from these agents are
hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, stomatitis, hypertension,
and fatigue.3,5,7,8 These observations have been made in
patients with RCC and in patients with gastrointestinal
stroma tumors. The frequency of patient-reported fatigue
prompted several investigators to monitor thyroid function in these patients to rule out hypothyroidism. Both
sunitinib and sorafenib reportedly induced subclinical or
overt hypothyroidism in up to 85% and 21% of patients,
respectively.3,9-11 The mechanism through which these
TKIs cause changes in thyroid function is not entirely
understood. Explanations include TKI-induced inhibition of VEGFR tyrosine kinases on thyroid cells, resulting
in capillary regression12,13; inhibition of the protein product of the ret proto-oncogene14; and inhibition of iodine
uptake15 or of peroxidase activity.16 Finally, the kinases
that are inhibited by sunitinib and sorafenib regulate
growth and function in both normal and neoplastic thyroid cells.17 Thus, it has been demonstrated that these
agents induce clinical responses in patients with thyroid
carcinoma.18
Drug-induced hypothyroidism may not necessarily
be perceived as an unwanted, detrimental toxicity. Thyroid hormones reportedly increased the growth of glioma
cells,19 whereas hypothyroidism inhibited the growth of
lung, prostate, hepatocellular, and mammary tumors in
animal models.20-22 Hypothyroidism was associated with
improved outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer,23 glioblastoma,24 and metastatic breast cancer.25 In
patients with mRCC, the association between hypothyroidism and survival has been controversial: High thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) levels before treatment with
interleukin-2 were associated with poor survival,26
whereas the therapeutic induction of hypothyroidism
reportedly favored a response to interleukin-2
treatment.27
Reports of sunitinib with induced and sorafenibinduced hypothyroidism in patients mRCC were consistent with our own observations and prompted us to establish the regular monitoring of thyroid function in all
patients who were receiving either drug. The objective of
the current prospective, explorative study was to investigate whether hypothyroidism has an impact on the outcome of patients with mRCC who receive sunitinib or
sorafenib.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eighty-seven consecutive patients who were considered
for treatment with a TKI for mRCC were included in this
exploratory study. These patients had either progressed on
cytokines and/or had received a TKI or monoclonal antibody before the current analysis was initiated. The choice
to prescribe sunitinib or sorafenib was based on the availability of each agent and, subsequently, on the results
from the pivotal trials.3
Sunitinib or sorafenib was prescribed at a dose of 50
mg daily (on a 4 weeks on/2 weeks off schedule) or 800
mg daily (continuously), respectively. Staging investigations were performed at baseline and every 12 weeks
thereafter and included computed tomography scans and/
or magnetic resonance imaging as indicated. Objective
remission was assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).28
Blood cell counts and serum chemistry were assessed
at baseline, every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of
treatment, and once monthly thereafter. Thyroid function
was assessed at baseline, monthly during the first 2
months of treatment, and every 2 to 4 months thereafter
and included serum levels of TSH and the thyroid hormones tri-iodthyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Before
treatment, all patients were analyzed for the presence or
history of thyroid dysfunction. According to our institutional laboratory, the following serum levels related to
thyroid function were considered normal: TSH, from
0.44 to 3.77 lU/mL; T4, from 58 to 124 ng/mL; and T3,
from 0.8 to 1.8 ng/mL. Subclinical hypothyroidism was
defined as TSH serum levels above the upper limit of normal with normal T4 and T3 serum concentrations.29
Clinical symptoms were assessed every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment and once monthly
thereafter. Thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine was initiated based on the intensity of clinical symptoms reported by the patient. An informed consent was not
required; because, after the first reported occurrence of
hypothyroidism in patients who were receiving sunitinib or
sorafenib, a thyroid function assessment was considered
part of the routine test battery in our department. The
institutional ethics committee provided written approval
for this procedure and agreed on publication of the data.

Statistical Methods
Progression-free survival (PFS) was computed as the time
from treatment initiation to disease progression or death,

535

Original Article

and overall survival (OS) was computed as the time from
treatment initiation to death. Survival to the end of the
observation period was considered a censored observation.
To model a possible time-dependent effect of an early
TSH increase (>3.77 lM/mL), survival analyses were
performed with different starting times: at the initiation
of therapy, 1 month after therapy initiation, and 2 months
after therapy initiation (eg, for the latter starting time,
only those patients who were observed for at least 2
months were included). This analysis strategy allowed us
to use common Kaplan-Meier curves in a time-dependent
manner. All reported survival times were computed from
the date therapy was initiated. Log-rank tests and Cox
proportional hazards models were used for univariate and
multiple assessments of prognostic factors. A 2-tailed significance level of 5% was assumed. Because the study was
exploratory rather than confirmatory, no adjustment for
multiple testing was done.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The baseline characteristics of all patients are presented in
Table 1. Between August 2006 and September 2008, 87
consecutive patients with a median age of 64 years were
included in this analysis. Of these, 82.8% of patients had an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, and most (71.3%) were classified with
intermediate-risk disease according to the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk group assessment.30 Previous treatments included cytokines (63.2% of
patients) and TKIs (sunitinib, 13.8%; sorafenib, 10.3%;
and/or bevacizumab, 9.2%), and 5.7% of patients also had
undergone (incomplete) metastasectomy before treatment.
Thyroid Function at Baseline
Seventy-eight of 87 patients were evaluable for thyroid
function assessment at baseline. Fourteen patients had a
history of hypothyroidism with associated levothyroxine
treatment. TSH levels at baseline (TSH0) were below or
above the normal range in 4 patients (4.6%) and 5
patients (5.7%), respectively. No association was observed
between the type of previous treatment and TSH0 levels
(P ¼ .16; chi-square statistic, 2.3).

Hyperthyroidism was defined as a TSH level >3.77 lM/mL

of patients (sunitinib, n ¼ 12; sorafenib, n ¼ 18), respectively, whereas T4 and T3 concentrations were within
normal ranges during the entire treatment period. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism was associated with fatigue in
21 patients. Hormone replacement was initiated in 16
patients and led to TSH normalization in 4 patients,
whereas 12 patients remained hypothyroid, although they
had lower TSH levels than before they received hormone
replacement. Seven patients who were treated for hypothyroidism before they started treatment with sunitinib or
sorafenib required an increase in their levothyroxine dose.
Treatment with levothyroxine did not alter the incidence
or severity of fatigue. The incidence of fatigue in hypothyroid and euthyroid patients was 70% and 58.5%, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed
in the incidence of fatigue (chi-square statistic, 1.08; P ¼
.35) or the severity of fatigue (chi-square statistic, 0.329;
P ¼ .55) between those 2 groups.
No statistically significant association was observed
between the occurrence of hypothyroidism and previous
treatment (chi-square statistic, 1.604; P ¼ .21) and the
dose or schedule of sunitinib or sorafenib (chi-square statistic, 1.66; P ¼ .255). Moreover, we observed no association between the development of hypothyroidism and
patient age and or sex (patients ages 18-49 years vs

Remissions
Eleven patients who were receiving sunitinib and 5
patients who were receiving sorafenib achieved either
complete remission (n ¼ 3) or partial remission (n ¼ 8),
for an ORR of 19.3%, as outlined in Tables 2 and 3. Fifteen of those 16 patients were diagnosed with (subclinical)
hypothyroidism during sunitinib or sorafenib treatment.
There was a statistically significant correlation between
the occurrence of hypothyroidism and the achievement of
remission (ORR: hypothyroid patients, 28.3%; euthyroid
patients, 3.3%; P < .001).
Progression-Free Survival
The median PFS was 11.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.0-14.9 months), as outlined in Table 4.
Patients who had a TSHmax1 >3.77 lM/mL had a longer
PFS (17.0 months) than patients who had a TSHmax1
3.77 lM/mL (10.4 months; P ¼ .29; hazard ratio
[HR], 0.71). The impact of hypothyroidism on PFS was
particularly pronounced in the sorafenib treatment group

3.77 lM/mL: PFS, 5.5 months; HR, 0.46; 95% CI,
0.20-1.07; P ¼ .065). A similar difference was observed
for patients who had a TSHmax2 >3.77 lM/mL compared with patients who had a TSHmax2 3.77 lM/mL
(entire cohort: PFS, 17 months and 10.8 months, respectively; HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.47-1.48; P ¼ .53; sorafenib
treatment group: 17.5 months and 7.1 months, respectively; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.23-1.20; P ¼ .12.
Overall Survival
The median OS was 25.4 months (95% CI, 13.9 months
to not reached) for the entire patient population, 25.4
months for patients in the sunitinib treatment group, and
not reached for patients in the sorafenib treatment group.
Patients with hypothyroidism at baseline survived
longer than patients without hypothyroidism at baseline
(Fig. 1a). Patients who had hypothyroidism within the
first month of treatment (TSHmax1) had a statistically significant longer survival than patients who had normal

Hypothyroidism as a Predictor
of Progression-Free Survival and
Overall Survival
Several clinical and laboratory variables were tested for
their impact on PFS (Table 5) and OS (Table 6), including the time from diagnosis to the development of metastatic disease (<1 year or 1 year), ECOG performance
status (0 vs 1), the number of metastatic sites (1 vs 2 vs
3), the types of metastatic sites (lung, liver, bone, central
nervous system), types of previous treatments (cytokines,
anti-VEGF-based) MSKCC risk group, TSH0 (>3.77
lM/mL or 3.77 lM/mL), TSHmax1 (>3.77 lM/mL or
3.77 lM/mL), and TSHmax2 (>3.77 lM/mL or 3.77
lM/mL). None of these factors were associated with PFS

on univariate or multivariate analysis. In contrast, when
we tested these factors for their impact on OS, TSHmax1
and TSHmax2 3.77 lM/mL were associated with worse
survival on univariate analysis (P ¼ .044 and P ¼ .016,
respectively). On multivariate analysis, only a TSHmax2
increase >3.77 lM/mL was an independent predictor of
survival (P ¼ .014; HR, 0.31).

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective
analysis to demonstrate that hypothyroidism, which is a
frequent side effect from treatment with sorafenib and
sunitinib, predicts the course of the disease in patients
with mRCC. We observed that patients who had subclinical hypothyroidism during treatment with sunitinib or
sorafenib had a significantly greater probability of
responding to treatment. Moreover, an increase in TSH
within 2 months of starting treatment was associated with
significantly longer survival compared with the survival of
patients without hypothyroidism. Finally, the development of hypothyroidism within 2 months of treatment
was an independent predictor of survival. Our data are
supported by the preliminary findings of Wolter, who
reported that patients with thyroid function abnormalities
who received sunitinib had a longer PFS than patients
without such abnormalities.31 In contrast to hypothyroidism, the classic MSKCC30 prognostic criteria did not
reach statistical significance in our population, which may
have been related to the smaller number of patients in our
trial compared with larger study populations.
In clinical oncology, correlations between hypothyroidism and outcomes occasionally have been
observed.19-25,27 It has been suggested that the thyroid
hormone itself, by stimulating other growth factors, may
represent a growth-stimulating signal in various tumor
types.32 Thus, a hypothyroid state appears to constitute an
advantage for cancer patients. In this context, it is interesting to note that, in our current study, the few patients
who had baseline hypothyroidism had a longer survival
than the patients without baseline hypothyroidism.
Because hypothyroidism is uncommon in the general population,33 it is possible that patients with cancer may benefit from drugs that induce changes in thyroid function.
It is unclear whether the induction of hypothyroidism is part of the mode of action of sunitinib and
sorafenib or whether it merely represents a pharmacokinetic epiphenomenon that results from a more appropriate individual dose. Hypothyroidism per se may lead to

542

the modulation of paracrine growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor,34 insulin-like growth factor-I,35
and others.36 Berg et al36 have reported that the membrane protein integrin (amb3) contains a cell surface receptor site for thyroid hormone that is linked to the
activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
and angiogenesis. In addition, others have demonstrated
that neoangiogenesis may be decreased by hypothyroidism. The occurrence of hypothyroidism also may reflect
differences in pharmacokinetics, affinity to receptor tyrosine kinases, and individual dose. TKIs are prescribed
independently from the weight and height of patients
and have demonstrated high interpatient pharmacokinetic variability.37 In our study, the median PFS of
euthyroid patients who received sorafenib patients was
consistent with previous reports (5.5 months),5 whereas
hypothyroid patients who received sorafenib achieved a
median PFS of 19 months. This may reflect a better
individual pharmacokinetic profile. Therefore, we
believe that both drug-induced hypothyroidism per se
and interpatient pharmacokinetic variability may explain
our results.
Receptor-TKIs represent a considerable improvement for the majority of patients with RCC; however, not
all patients respond to treatment, and some may benefit
more from other novel therapeutic strategies. To optimize
and individualize treatment in mRCC, predictive factors
are urgently required. To date, in the case of novel agents,
only a few predictive factors have been reported: It has
been proposed that the expression patterns of hypoxia-inducible factor alpha 1 and 2—intracellular proteins that
are up-regulated differentially in RCC—may facilitate the
selection of targeted therapy.38 However, such analyses
might not be feasible in routine clinical practice. In contrast, the ability of a drug to rapidly induce hypothyroidism might serve as a broadly available surrogate
biomarker. The practicability of clinical biomarkers also
has been described by Rini et al, who reported that the
induction of a diastolic blood pressure increase predicted
survival in patients who received treatment with axitinib.39 Moreover, a biomarker could serve as an additional
criterion for assessment of response to these TKIs.
RECIST criteria are not appropriate for assessing response
in the case of targeted agents, because cavitation and necrosis often are observed before a decrease in tumor volume can be detected.40 Thus, together with radiologic
findings, the occurrence of hypothyroidism may facilitate
the decision to continue treatment by reflecting more
accurately the true therapeutic benefit.

Impact of Hypothyroidism/Schmidinger et al

Our findings raise 4 major questions: First, the
swiftness with which hypothyroidism develops needs to
be clarified. In our analysis, the time of TSH assessment
was chosen arbitrarily and represented a snap-shot of the
thyroid function during treatment. In our series, all hypothyroid patients were diagnosed with increased TSH
within the first 8 weeks of treatment. Those who had no
increase within 2 months remained euthyroid for the
entire treatment period. However, some patients may
present with hypothyroidism later, and these patients may
benefit like the patients who have hypothyroidism diagnosed earlier. In contrast, TSH also may be increased already within the first 1 or 2 weeks, thereby allowing for an
early change in treatment. Second, it remains unclear
whether the degree of TSH increase is relevant for treatment outcome. We did not observe a correlation between
TSH levels and outcomes; however, this might be related
to the relatively small number of patients in the current
analysis. Third, the role of thyroid hormone-replacement
therapy remains to be determined. If induction of hypothyroidism is part of the mode of action of sunitinib and
sorafenib, then levothyroxine may undermine the antitumor efficacy of these agents. In our cohort, levothyroxine
treatment did not have an impact on outcome, but most
of our patients remained in a hypothyroid state despite
replacement therapy. Fourth, it is unclear whether an
increased TKI dose might lead to hypothyroidism (and,
possibly, to an associated response) in patients who do not
present a priori with hypothyroidism at the standard dose.
In conclusion, the current results indicated that
sunitinib and sorafenib induced hypothyroidism in a large
number of patients. Hypothyroidism no longer should be
perceived as an unwanted side effect of treatment but,
rather, as predictive marker for treatment outcome in
patients with mRCC. To define the full potential of this
biomarker compared with other prognostic and predictive
factors, future studies should include a larger number of
patients. Moreover, the role of this phenomenon should
be investigated in other types of cancer.
