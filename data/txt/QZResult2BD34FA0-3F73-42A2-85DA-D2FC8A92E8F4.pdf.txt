Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an invariably fatal plasma cell
malignancy, primarily due to the therapeutic resistance which
ultimately arises. Much of the resistance results from the
expression of various survival factors. Despite this, the
ribonucleoside analogue, 8-chloro-adenosine (8-Cl-Ado), is
cytotoxic to a number of MM cell lines. Previously, we
established that the analogue incorporates into the RNA and
inhibits mRNA synthesis. Because 8-Cl-Ado is able to
overcome survival signals present in MM cells and inhibits
mRNA synthesis, it is likely that the drug induces cytotoxicity
by depleting the expression of critical MM survival genes. We
investigated this question using gene array analysis, real-time
reverse transcription-PCR, and immunoblot analysis on 8-ClAdo–treated MM.1S cells and found that the mRNA and
protein levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET decrease
prior to apoptosis. To determine MET’s role in 8-Cl-Ado
cytotoxicity, we generated MM.1S clones stably expressing a
MET ribozyme. None of the clones expressed <25% of the basal
levels of MET mRNA, suggesting that a threshold level of MET
is necessary for their survival. Additionally, the ribozyme
knockdown lines were more sensitive to the cytotoxic actions
of 8-Cl-Ado as caspase-3 activation and the induction of polyADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage were more pronounced and evident 12 h earlier than in the parental cells.
We further established MET’s role in MM cell survival by
demonstrating that a retroviral MET RNA interference
construct induces PARP cleavage in MM.1S cells. These results
show that MET provides a survival mechanism for MM cells.
8-Cl-Ado overcomes MM cell survival by a mechanism that
involves the depletion of MET. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9913–20]

Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a progressive, debilitating, and
uniformly fatal B cell disorder typified by the accumulation and
dissemination of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow which
subsequently induce bone lesions (1). With established therapies,
f50% of the patients with MM show an initial response, but
ultimately develop drug resistance (2). Much of the difficulty in
effectively treating this disease is due to the indolent nature and
longevity of these cells (3); their low proliferative index deters the

effectiveness of DNA-directed therapies, and the presence of
multiple antiapoptotic signals allows for their inherent as well as
escalating resistance (4, 5).
Overcoming the cell survival mechanisms is imperative for
effectively treating MM. This can be achieved by inhibiting the
expression of key components of the antiapoptotic signaling
pathways. Agents directed at RNA synthesis offer an effective
approach for abrogating survival signaling (6, 7). Although these
agents globally affect RNA synthesis, their activities are more
pronounced against transcripts with faster turnover rates. Typically, short-lived transcripts are encoded by oncogenes as well as
regulators of other key processes such as cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, and cell survival. Therefore, treatments that impede
mRNA synthesis would be expected to selectively hinder their
expression and be detrimental to neoplastic cells that are
dependent on their presence. This may be especially true for
indolent cancer cells that are highly dependent on antiapoptotic
signals as is evident in studies on chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL). Flavopiridol, a cell cycle and transcription inhibitor, as well
as the transcription inhibitors, 8-chloro-adenosine (8-Cl-Ado) and
8-amino-Ado, all showed potent cytotoxic activity in noncycling
CLL cells in vitro and encouraging results were seen in clinical
trials for patients with CLL treated with flavopiridol (8–11). In
addition to exploiting the tumor cells’ dependency on short-lived
transcripts, RNA-directed agents also take advantage of the
selective sensitivity that transformed cells have against the
inhibition of RNA polymerase II activity that is not seen in
nontransformed cells (7, 12), further underscoring the therapeutic
effectiveness of these agents.
The ribonucleoside analogue, 8-Cl-Ado, exhibits a strong
potential for use as an effective therapeutic agent in MM as it
mediates cytolysis in a variety of MM cell lines, including lines
which are resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents
(13, 14). In contrast to the dual actions of flavopiridol, which
inhibits both RNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, the only
known mode of action of 8-Cl-Ado in MM cells is RNA synthesis
inhibition. Additionally, we have shown that 8-Cl-Ado cytotoxicity
is contingent on its intracellular phosphorylation to 8-Cl-AMP by
adenosine kinase (14), which is followed by the formation of 8-ClATP. Due to adenosine kinase’s high specific activity and
substantial substrate specificity for 8-Cl-Ado, 8-Cl-ATP accumulates to near millimolar levels in MM cells. Parallel to 8-Cl-ATP
accumulation, the endogenous ATP pool decreases, resulting in a
high ratio of 8-Cl-ATP to ATP. The net effect of this is a decline in
RNA synthesis (14). The RNA synthesis inhibition is caused by the
analogue incorporating into RNA and prematurely terminating
transcription (15). Of the various types of transcripts, mRNA
synthesis is inhibited the most due to the preferential incorporation by RNA polymerase II into the body of the mRNA and the
likely detrimental effects on polyadenylate polymerase (16).

Although the metabolism of 8-Cl-Ado and its actions on RNA
synthesis are well established, little is known about the corollary of
this action. Because 8-Cl-Ado is able to overcome strong survival
signals present in MM cells and inhibits mRNA synthesis, it is likely
to induce cytotoxicity by diminishing the expression of short-lived
transcripts critical for MM survival. To decipher possible
alterations in survival signaling induced by this analogue, in the
present study, we used cDNA arrays for the identification of
maximally affected transcripts in MM cells and assessed the role of
the depletion of a candidate survival gene, MET, in MM cell survival
and 8-Cl-Ado cell killing.

Materials and Methods
Materials and vectors. 8-Cl-Ado was obtained from Dr. V. Rao at the
Drug Development Branch of the National Cancer Institute. The MET
ribozyme and control plasmids were obtained from John Laterra, Kennedy
Krieger Research Institute, The Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine, Baltimore, MD (17). Briefly, the MET 560 ribozyme construct
containing U1snRNA, MET antisense sequence, and a hammerhead
ribozyme that targets MET mRNA at residue 560, was subcloned into a
modified pZeo plasmid containing a zeocin-selectable marker. The design
of the viral construct, MET-shRNA, was based on the small interfering RNA
(siRNA) positioned at MET nt 3310 described by Shinomiya et al. (18). The
hairpin siRNA–encoding DNA sequences were generated using the Insert
Design Tool (Ambion). The sense and antisense strands (respective
sequences: 5¶-GATCCGTGCAGTATCCTCTGACAGTTCAAGAGACTGTCAGAGGATACTGCACTTTTTTGGAAA-3¶ and 5¶-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGTGCAGTATCCTCTGACAGTCTCTTGAACTGTCAGAGGATACTGCACG-3¶)
were annealed and subcloned into the RetroVector pSilencer 5.1-H1 Retro
vector (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell culture, transfection, and viral infection. The MM.1S and MM.1R
cell lines were obtained from the laboratory of Drs. Nancy Krett and
Steven Rosen (Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) and the RPMI 8226 and the U-266 cell lines
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection maintained in
RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the
presence of 5% CO2 at 37jC. Cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma
infection using a commercially available kit (Invitrogen). Doubling times
were measured in cultures seeded <1  105 cells/mL and duplicate
aliquots were each counted twice on a Z2 Coulter Counter (Beckman
Coulter, Inc.) daily until reaching a plateau of f1  106 cells/mL.
Doubling times were calculated using Prism software (GraphPad Software)
and expressed as a mean of triplicate analyses. Cell cycle profiles were
determined as described (14).
A 0.3% stable transfection rate was estimated for MM.1S cells after
nucleofection of 1  106 cells with 2 Ag of linearized enhanced green
fluorescent protein plasmid (BD Bioscience) using Nucleofector Kit V,
program T-16 (Amaxa Biosystems) and 45 days of selection with G418.
MM.1S cells stably expressing the ribozyme or control constructs were
similarly generated by nucleofection with 2 mg linearized ribozyme or
control plasmid. The cells were then diluted and f3,000 cells were plated in
100 AL of culture media containing 200 Ag/mL of Zeocin (Invitrogen) for
selection per well of a 96-well plate.
The MET-shRNA and the empty vector viral constructs were packaged in
the BD RetroPack PT67 cells (Clonetech) and viral stocks were obtained
from culture supernatants filtered through a 0.22-Am filter. Infections were
done by inoculating MM1.S cells with the viral stocks for 12 h in the
presence of 4 Ag/mL of Sequa-brene (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.) followed by the
addition of a f10-fold volume of fresh media.
cDNA array analysis. 32P-labeled cDNA generated from the mRNA,
isolated with the FastTrack 2.0 mRNA Kit (Invitrogen), was used to screen
the Atlas Human Cancer cDNA Expression Arrays (BD Bioscience)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer and quantitated with a
Storm 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Changes in gene expression
were calculated using the AtlasNavigator software (BD Bioscience).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Exponentially
growing MM.1S cells were harvested after treatment with 10 Amol/L of
8-Cl-Ado for various amounts of time, and the RNA was isolated with the
RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen S.A.) with three to six replicates for each time point.
The gene expression levels were measured on an ABI prism 7900 Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using one-step real-time TaqMan
RT-PCR. The MET, TXN2, and 12 S mitochondrial RNA TaqMan primers
and probes (Sigma GenoSys) were designed with PrimerExpress software
(Applied Biosystems) and their sequences are presented in Supplementary
Table S1. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers
and probe mix was purchased from Applied Biosystems ‘‘Predeveloped Assay
Reagents.’’ The relative gene expression levels were quantitated using
standard curves generated from known dilutions of untreated MM.1S cell
RNA or the MET-expressing colon cancer cell line, KM-20, and normalized
with GAPDH levels in studies not involving drug treatment. Because of their
relatively long half-lives, mitochondrial 12 S and TXN2 (19, 20) were used to
normalize MET expression in experiments involving 8-Cl-Ado treatment.
Each RNA sample was assayed in triplicate and the results are presented as
a percentage of the MET expression level in untreated MM.1S cells.
Immunopreciptiation and Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed,
electrophoresed, and transferred as described (9) or electrophoresed on
Criterion Bis-Tris gels using the XT MOPS buffer kit (Bio-Rad). For detection
of MET, 1 to 2 mg of lysate was immunoprecipitated with a 1:50 dilution
of the rabbit polyclonal MET antisera, C12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as
described (21) prior to electrophoresis. The membranes were then probed
with anti-MET mouse monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology)
or anti-MET rabbit polyclonal antibody (Assay Designs). Other primary
antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal antibodies to BCL-2, MCL-1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), and survivin (R&D Systems Inc.), and mouse
monoclonal antibodies to h-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.), poly-ADP-ribose
polymerase (PARP; C2-10), BCL-XL, XIAP, (BD Bioscience), and to GAPDH,
6C6 (Abcam, Inc.). The blots were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce)
or with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). MET
levels were quantitated using Kodak 1D Image Analysis software (Eastman
Kodak Company), normalized to controls, and presented relative to intensity.
Caspase-3 activity. Exponentially growing MM.1S cells were harvested
after treatment with 10 Amol/L of 8-Cl-Ado for various amounts of time,
lysed, and assessed using a caspase-3 fluorometric assay (R&D Systems Inc)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

Results
8-Cl-Ado inhibits gene expression. Previously, we showed that
treatment of MM.1S cells with 5 to 10 Amol/L of 8-Cl-Ado rapidly
inhibits mRNA synthesis within 4 h (15) and initiates apoptosis by
24 h (13). Because these cells are known for their multiple antiapoptotic signals and 8-Cl-Ado is able to overcome these strong
survival signals to induce apoptosis, it is likely that the analogue
induces cytotoxicity by diminishing the expression of critical MM
survival genes. To determine if the mRNA synthesis inhibition affects
the expression of genes involved in cell survival, cDNA arrays were
screened to assess changes in gene expression after treatment of
MM.1S cells with 8-Cl-Ado. Of the genes probed on the array, eight
showed a decrease in expression levels z3-fold after an 8-h treatment
with 10 Amol/L of 8-Cl-Ado (Fig. 1A; Supplemental Table S2).
Intriguingly, of these eight, one has been shown to be involved in
the pathobiology of MM and encodes the MET receptor tyrosine
kinase (22–26). MET was first discovered as an oncogene and
subsequently found to be the receptor for hepatocyte growth
factor/scatter factor (HGF). As an oncogene, MET has been shown
to be involved in the growth, survival, and metastasis of numerous
forms of cancers (27, 28). In both primary MM cells and cell lines,
MET is typically found in an autocrine loop with HGF (25) and
HGF/MET signaling has been shown to promote MM cell growth
(22, 29). In accord with the concept that short-lived transcripts are

the definitive target of transcription inhibitors, the half-life of the
MET transcript has been reported to be <30 min (30). By using the
AtlasNavigator software to compare the changes in the hybridization levels on the cDNA arrays, the expression level of MET was
determined to be decreased by f80% (Fig. 1B).
Interestingly, in contrast to reports on the effects of other
transcription inhibitors in MM cells (31–34), the expression of
the antiapoptotic gene, MCL-1, did not significantly change
after 8-Cl-Ado treatment (Fig. 1A), which was confirmed and
the analysis was expanded over a 24-h period by real-time
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)4 and Western blot analysis
(Fig. 2A). Additionally, we also examined the effects on other
short-lived antiapoptotic molecules (BCL-XL, BCL-2, XIAP, and
survivin) by real-time RT-PCR4 and/or Western blot analysis and
found no significant effects on their expression (Fig. 2A).
8-Cl-Ado inhibits MET expression. Because of the apparent
involvement of HGF/MET signaling in MM, we wanted to further
explore the effects and possible role of MET in 8-Cl-Ado–mediated
cytotoxicity. To examine the effects of 8-Cl-Ado on MET expression
and to quantitate the inhibition kinetics, MM.1S cells were treated
with 10 Amol/L of 8-Cl-Ado for 24 h and MET mRNA levels were
measured by real-time RT-PCR after various times of treatment
(Fig. 2B). The results showed that there was an initial decrease in
the MET expression levels within 4 h of treatment and continued to
decrease up to 60% by 24 h. 8-Cl-Ado has been found to be
cytotoxic to all MM cell lines tested including RPMI 8226, U-266,
and MM.1R4 (13). We also examined these three MM cell lines and
showed a similar time-dependent depletion of MET mRNA upon
treatment with 10 Amol/L of 8-Cl-Ado (Fig. 2C).

Additionally, a block in MET mRNA synthesis would be expected
to instigate a decrease in MET protein levels as its also has a short
half-life (35). To determine this, MET was immunoprecipitated
from cell extracts prepared from MM.1S cells after various times of
8-Cl-Ado treatment and the levels were measured by immunoblot
analysis. The analysis revealed that the MET protein levels diminish
with the appropriate delayed kinetics as compared with the mRNA
inhibition kinetics (Fig. 2D), indicating a temporal relationship
between these events. Overall, these results show that 8-Cl-Ado
treatment diminishes the expression levels of MET mRNA and
protein in MM cells.
Generation of MET knockdown cell lines. Our hypothesis,
based on the sequel regarding the 8-Cl-Ado–induced decline in
MET transcript and proteins, is that the loss of MET results in the
death of MM cells or sensitizes the cells to 8-Cl-Ado killing. To
assess the effects of MET expression in MM cells, we used a
chimeric U1snRNA/ribozyme construct designed to specifically
target and knock down MET levels (17). MM.1S cells were stably
transfected with the MET ribozyme or the pU1 control plasmid and
subsequently screened for MET mRNA levels by real-time RT-PCR.
The levels of MET transcript in 28 of 29 pU1 control-transfected
clones were very comparable to mRNA levels in wild-type cells. In
contrast, the MET transcript levels in 15 out of 30 MET ribozyme
knockdown clones were at least 50% or less of the levels in the
parental cells (Fig. 3A ) with the lowest expressing clones
containing f25% of the parental cells’ level of MET.
MET expression promotes cell growth. The MET inhibitor,
PHA-665752, inhibits the growth of MM cells (29). To determine the
effects of reduced MET expression on cell growth, doubling times
were calculated on exponentially growing clones and parental
MM.1S cells using Prism software and presented as a fold change
over the parental MM.1S cell (Fig. 3B). The results showed that
whereas the doubling time for the control clone, pU1-C6, did not
significantly vary from the f40 h MM.1S doubling time, the
doubling time for both MET ribozyme clones, MM.D6 and MM.F2,
were significantly prolonged to 1.29 (P = 0.003) and 1.66 (P = 0.014)
times longer, respectively. These results indicate that MM cells with
lower levels of MET grow at a slower rate. To assess the basis of the
diminished growth in the cells expressing the MET ribozyme, the
cell cycle profile of the ribozyme lines, MM.D6 and MM.F2, were
examined and compared with the MM.1S parental cells and the
pU1 vector control line (Fig. 3C). The levels of the sub-G1
population of cells, reflecting the level of endogenous cell death,
in the parental MM.1S cells and the vector control cells were f5%.
In both MET knockdown cell lines, the levels were more than
double this value, f11%, but this difference was not statistically
significant.
8-Cl-Ado further inhibits MET expression in the MET
ribozyme clones. To compare the effects of 8-Cl-Ado on MET
expression, the parental, control, and MET ribozyme knockdown
cells were treated with 10 Amol/L of 8-Cl-Ado for 24 h and the
levels of MET mRNA was measured by real-time RT-PCR after
various times of treatment (Fig. 4A). In the pU1-C6 control cells,
the level of MET expression decreased with a similar kinetics as
seen in the MM.1S cells. As expected, both MM.D6 and MM.F2 cells
started with a lower level of MET mRNA, which was further
reduced with 8-Cl-Ado treatment. In addition, immunoblot analysis
of the MET protein levels in MET immunoprecipitates from the cell
lysates also showed that the loss of MET mRNA synthesis
translated into a decrease in MET protein levels (Fig. 4B) similar
to what is seen in the parental MM.1S cells.

Depletion of MET accelerates 8-Cl-Ado–induced cytotoxicity.
Although we found that 8-Cl-Ado treatment inhibits MET
expression prior to the induction of cytotoxicity, it is uncertain
if this is merely a casual association or if it is causative. If the
decline in MET expression plays a role in the cytotoxic actions of
8-Cl-Ado, then upon treatment, the onset of apoptosis in cells
with lower basal levels of MET should be quicker and more
pronounced as the minimal threshold level of MET would be
attained faster. To address this question, parental, control, and
MET ribozyme knockdown cells were treated with 10 Amol/L of
8-Cl-Ado and the degree of PARP cleavage, a marker of apoptosis,
was assessed at various times by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5A).
In both the parental MM.1S cells and in the pU1-C6 control
cells, the induction of PARP cleavage was not detected until a
minimum of 24 h of 8-Cl-Ado treatment. In contrast, 8-Cl-Ado
induced PARP cleavage in both of the MET ribozyme lines, MM.D6
and MM.F2, within half this time, f12 h earlier than in MM.1S
cells.
The enhanced induction of apoptosis by 8-Cl-Ado in the MET
ribozyme knockdown clones was further confirmed with a
fluorometric caspase 3 assay. This apical caspase was found to
be activated earlier and to a greater extent in 8-Cl-Ado–treated
MET ribozyme line, MM.D6, as compared with MM.1S cells or the
pU1-C6 control cells (Fig. 5B). These results show that MM cells
with lower basal levels of MET are more sensitive to the cytotoxic
activities of 8-Cl-Ado and further implies that MET signaling is
necessary for the survival of MM cells. These results also confirm
our hypothesis that 8-Cl-Ado induces apoptosis by diminishing the
expression of survival genes.
Depletion of MET is cytotoxic for MM cells. The finding that
none of the 30 stable MET ribozyme clones expressed MET at levels
<25% of the parental cells suggests that MM cells are dependent on
MET and lose their survival advantage when MET levels fall below a
minimal threshold level. To further address this question, we
infected MM.1S cells with MET-shRNA or the vector control
retrovirus. Interestingly, cells infected with the control virus
showed f1.5-fold increase in MET transcript levels as compared
with untreated MM.1S cells (Fig. 6A). In contrast, as compared with
the untreated MM.1S cells, cells infected with the MET siRNA–
producing retrovirus depleted the MET transcript levels by f35%,
80%, and 95% by 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Immunoblot analysis
of PARP in the infected cells showed that PARP cleavage was
readily detected by 48 h in the cells infected with MET-shRNA but
not in the untreated or the vector control–infected MM.1S cells
(Fig. 6B); thus, conclusively showing that MM.1S cells are
dependent on MET for survival.

We show that 8-Cl-Ado induces the depletion of MET expression
and that this attenuation promotes the analogue’s cytotoxic
activities. These results show that 8-Cl-Ado induces apoptosis in
MM cells by diminishing the expression of genes consequential for
their survival.
In recent years, it has become apparent that transcription is a
potential target for cancer therapeutics as RNA-directed agents
exploit the tumor cells’ dependency or addiction (36, 37) on shortlived oncogenes, growth regulators, and survival factors (6, 7).
These short-lived transcripts contain specific sequence elements
that signal their rapid degradation. The most common determinant
of RNA stability in mammalian cells are adenylate/uridylate-rich

Because the analogue does not completely stop RNA synthesis, the
levels of MET mRNA present during treatment would reflect its
decay rate plus the limited amount of its production. Additionally,
because 8-Cl-Ado prematurely terminates transcription, total RNA
would contain full-length as well as partial transcripts. Using realtime RT-PCR, we determined that the MET transcripts decrease by
60% after 24 h of 8-Cl-Ado treatment (Fig. 2B). In contrast, using
cDNA arrays, the levels were measured to diminish by 80% after 8 h
(Fig. 1B). One reason for this difference is that for the cDNA arrays,
MET mRNA levels were measured in poly(A+)-selected RNA;
therefore, only mRNA that were fully transcribed through the
adenylate-rich 3¶-untranslated region as well as polyadenylated
would be detected. Total RNA was used for the real-time RT-PCR
and the MET primers, and the probe spanned the boundary of

elements commonly termed AREs (38). There are multiple
potential ARE-like motifs present in the MET mRNA sequence.
The possibility that these regions might be functional AREs is
consistent with the short half-life (<30 min) of the MET mRNA (30).
Previously, we found that mRNA synthesis was inhibited by
f50% in MM.1S cells treated with 10 Amol/L of 8-Cl-Ado (15).

exons 20 and 21; thus, any prematurely terminated transcripts that
included this sequence as well as full-length transcripts would be
detected. Another reason for the discrepancy is the normalization
methods used in the two procedures. For the cDNA arrays, the
signal value of the entire array was used by the Atlas software to
globally normalize gene expression levels. With real-time RT-PCR,
the MET gene expression levels were normalized to TXN2 and to
MT-RNR1 transcript levels, both of which also would decrease but
with a much slower decay rate. Although, real-time RT-PCR is
generally a highly accurate way to measure gene expression, in this
particular study, it is likely that it underestimated the extent to
which 8-Cl-Ado inhibits gene expression.
Our finding that MET depletion plays a role in the cytotoxic
activities of 8-Cl-Ado in MM cells complements what is already
known about the cellular function of MET and its role in MM.
Typically, in both primary MM cells and cell lines, MET is found in
an autocrine loop with HGF (39, 40), and MM cells are able to
proteolytically convert HGF into its active form (41). HGF/MET
signaling promotes the growth of MM cells (22, 29, 42) and boosts
MM cell adherence to the bone marrow matrix, which would
enhance the survival and drug resistance of MM cells in vivo (24).
This correlates with the finding of higher HGF serum and bone
marrow levels in advanced stages of MM (23, 26, 43, 44). Moreover,
the median survival time in patients with high serum HGF has
been shown to be shorter than in patients with low serum HGF

levels (45–47), further establishing the significance of HGF/MET
signaling in MM.
MET signaling has been shown to be sufficient for rescuing MM
cells from serum starvation (22), but it is uncertain if MET is
necessary for survival. Of the 30 MET ribozyme knockdown clones
that we analyzed, none expressed MET at <25% of the levels found
in the parental MM.1S cells. These results might be an indication
that there is a minimum level of MET that is required for MM cell
survival and any clones that expressed MET at levels lower than
this minimum did not survive selection. Similar to our results,
Herynk et al. found that the selection of colon cancer cells stably
transfected with the same ribozyme only generated clones with a
minimal reduction of MET expression (21). Using the pU1-MET
ribozyme in an adenovirus construct and measuring cell survival
with a colony-forming assay, they were able to show that a greater
reduction of MET in colon cancer cells is lethal. In contrast, in cells
that are not dependent on MET for survival, this same ribozyme
knocks down MET expression f100-fold (17, 27). In these studies,
which used either glial, prostate, and breast cancer lines, the cells
also lost their tumorigenic phenotype, but unlike the colon cancer
cells, they were able to endure selection with very low levels of
MET. Additionally, we showed that MET depletion enhances 8-ClAdo cytotoxicity, further suggesting that MET signaling is necessary
for the survival of MM cells; although it is possible that the
depletion of MET in MM cells does not invoke cell death, but
increases the sensitivity of the cells to additional activities of the
analogue. To conclusively address this question, we generated a
MET siRNA–producing retroviral construct, which would enable a
greater reduction of MET levels in MM cells without encountering
the difficulties imposed by selection. These results showed that this
level of MET depletion is cytotoxic to MM.1S even in the absence of
8-Cl-Ado.
Much of the work on MM cell survival has focused on the IL6–dependent activation of signal transducers and activators of
transcription 3, which in turn, induces the expression of MCL-1
(48). It is interesting to note that although IL-6 signaling is able
to rescue MM cells from common MM therapeutic agents such
as dexamethasone, IL-6 does not rescue MM cells from 8-Cl-Ado
(13). Our finding of the lack of involvement of MCL-1 may
explain this.

Myeloma Cell Killing by MET Depletion

There is increasing evidence that HGF and MET play an
instrumental role in the dissemination of MM cells in the bone
marrow, which would lead to escalating resistance and the
progression of this debilitating bone disease. In general, similar
to other cytokine receptors, activation of MET induces proliferation, migration, differentiation, and protection from apoptosis; but
uniquely, it also signals a morphogenic invasive-growth program
(28). This invasive-growth program allows cells to migrate through
the surrounding environment such as in the stimulated release of
reticulocytes from erythroid-containing stem cell colonies. HGF/
MET signaling stimulates MM cell secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and promotes endothelial cell–stimulated MM cell
invasion (49). In addition, MET signaling boosts MM cell adherence
to the bone marrow matrix (24) and induces angiogenesis by
stimulating the production of vascular endothelial growth factor
and inhibiting thrombospondin 1 expression (50). Thus, METdirected agents are anticipated to alleviate the debilitating bone
disease brought on by MM cells (29) as well as being detrimental to
their survival.
In conclusion, we used cDNA arrays to analyze the effects of
8-Cl-Ado on gene expression in MM cells. In doing so, we identified

eight genes that were down-regulated by 8-Cl-Ado, including the
MET oncogene. By stably transfecting MM.1S cells, we showed that
this attenuation accelerates the analogue’s cytotoxic activities,
demonstrating that 8-Cl-Ado induces apoptosis in MM cells by
hindering the expression of genes consequential for their survival.
These results provide further evidence for the efficacy of 8-Cl-Ado
as a chemotherapeutic agent in MM and suggests that the analogue
may also be beneficial for the alleviation of the bone disease. In
addition, our results show that 8-Cl-Ado is an effective agent for
targeting MET expression. Finally, we showed that MET expression
is required for MM cell survival even in the absence of 8-Cl-Ado.
