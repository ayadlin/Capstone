Abstract
Persistent DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) may determine the antitumor effects of ionizing radiation (IR)
by inducing apoptosis, necrosis, mitotic catastrophe, or permanent growth arrest. IR induces rapid modification of megabase chromatin domains surrounding DSBs via poly-ADP-ribosylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, and protein assembly. The dynamics of these IR-induced foci (IRIF) have been implicated in DNA damage
signaling and DNA repair. As an IRIF reporter, we tracked the relocalization of green fluorescent protein fused
to a chromatin binding domain of the checkpoint adapter protein 53BP1 after IR of breast cancer cells and
tumors. To block DSB repair in breast cancer cells and tumors, we targeted poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) with ABT-888 (veliparib), one of several PARP inhibitors currently in clinical trials. PARP inhibition
markedly enhanced IRIF persistence and increased breast cancer cell senescence both in vitro and in vivo,
arguing for targeting IRIF resolution as a novel therapeutic strategy. Cancer Res; 70(15); 6277–82. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Small molecules targeting cellular responses to DNA
damage have long been considered an attractive strategy to
improve the effectiveness of genotoxic cancer therapy (1). An
early event in the double-strand break (DSB) response is
rapid recruitment and activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), resulting in polymerization of poly(ADP
ribose) into PARP1 itself, histones, and other proteins at
DSBs and in the recruitment of macroH2AX to sites of
DNA damage to stimulate chromatin remodeling and DNA
repair (2–4). PARP activity is required for normal DNA
damage tolerance. Whereas most attention has been paid
to their potential in targeting malignancies defective in homologous recombination (5), PARP inhibitors are also promising as sensitizers for genotoxic agents and ionizing
radiation (IR; refs. 6, 7).
Coincident with PARP1 recruitment, ATM-dependent
phosphorylation of histone H2AX to form γH2AX at DSBs
promotes further chromatin modifications and assembly of

proteins at IR-induced foci (IRIF), such as MRE11/RAD50/
NBS1, MDC1, 53BP1, and BRCA1 (8, 9). Tracking the accumulation and dispersal of IRIF proteins offers complementary
reporters for checkpoint signaling and repair.
Herein, by exploiting green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused
to the chromatin-binding domain of 53BP1 as a live-cell imaging reporter for DSB repair, we monitored the effects of
PARP inhibition on irradiated breast cancer cells both in vitro
and in vivo. ABT-888 blocked IRIF resolution and cell proliferation, driving tumor cells toward accelerated senescence
and suppressing tumor regrowth compared with IR alone.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and constructs
GFP fused to the human 53BP1 IRIF binding domain (10)
was cloned into the pLVX-Tight-Puro lentiviral vector (Clontech), transduced into the MCF7 Tet-On Advanced cell line
(Clontech), and cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen)
with 10% Tet system-approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech). MCF7 Tet-On Advanced is certified by Clontech as derived from MCF7 (American Type Culture Collection) by viral
transduction and was used without further authentication.
After induction for 48 hours with 1 μg/mL doxycycline
(Sigma), GFP-positive cells were sorted to establish a stable
MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD cell line.
Xenograft tumors
17β-Estradiol pellets (1.7 mg; Innovative Research of
America) were implanted in female athymic nude mice (Harlan) 7 days before s.c. injection of 1 × 107 MCF7Tet-On GFPIBD cells in 100 μL of PBS. Once tumors grew to 300 mm3,
2 mg/mL doxycycline with 1% sucrose was added to the

of ABT-888 in water twice daily by oral gavage 48 hours before IR and thereafter as indicated.

camera controlled by Slidebook v4.2 software or Zeiss Axiovert
200M and a Hammatsu Orca ER FireWire digital monochrome
camera controlled by OpenLab software. For IRIF imaging in
tumors, we used a Leica SP5 Tandem Scanner Two-Photon
Spectral Confocal System controlled by LAS-AF 2.0 software.

(8). The functional elements of the 53BP1 IRIF binding domain
are a dimerizing domain, paired Tudor domains that recognize the stable histone marks H4-diMeK20 and/or H3diMeK79, and a nuclear localization signal (10, 11). Cells
lacking PARP activity display a delay in H2AX phosphorylation
and persistence of γH2AX foci (12). 53BP1 binding at IRIF is
partly dependent on H2AX phosphorylation and chromatin remodeling, also influenced by PARP activity. Thus, to examine
PARP inhibitor effects on IRIF kinetics in living cells, we placed
GFP fused to the 53BP1 IRIF binding domain (10) under tetracycline-inducible control (GFP-IBD; Supplementary Fig. S1) in
a lentiviral vector. We transduced MCF7 Tet-On Advanced
(MCF7 Tet-On, Clontech), which is a cell line derived from
MCF7, a p53-positive, caspase-3–negative, and apoptosisresistant human breast cancer–derived cell line that stably
expresses the Tet-On Advanced transactivator.
Following induction with doxycycline, unirradiated
MCF7Tet-On cells expressing inducible GFP-IBD (MCF7Tet-On
GFP-IBD) displayed pan-nuclear fluorescence, with only
rare nuclear foci (mean, 0.4 ± 0.7 per cell). Consistent with
previous reports, the GFP-IBD reporter relocalized within
minutes after IR to form nuclear foci that colocalized with
γH2AX, endogenous 53BP1, and MDC1 proteins (Supplementary Fig. S2). The GFP-IBD foci then slowly resolved
over the next 24 hours. The ATM kinase inhibitors
KU-55933 and CGK733 decreased GFP-IBD foci formation
(data not shown). In turn, shRNA knockdown of proteins

required for 53BP1 relocalization to IRIF, including ATM,
MDC1, and RNF8, blocked the formation of GFP-IBD foci
after IR (Fig. 1A). Significantly, knockdown of endogenous
53BP1 increased the number of GFP-IBD foci in unirradiated cells and slowed their resolution after IR, indicating
that 53BP1 remains active in MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD cells.
We examined IRIF formation and resolution in relation to
IR dose and time in MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD cells in vitro (Fig. 1B
and C). Most GFP-IBD foci resolved by 24 hours at doses up
to 8 Gy. For 2 Gy, the mean of 47 ± 13 IRIF at 3 hours decreased to 3.2 ± 1.7 at 24 hours, whereas for 8 Gy, the mean of
55 ± 15 IRIF at 3 hours decreased to 12 ± 6 at 24 hours. After
12 Gy, the mean of 53 ± 14 IRIF at 3 hours decreased only to
37 ± 18 at 24 hours. The increased IRIF persistence with higher IR dose suggests saturation of repair capacity or other
damage responses. Indeed, doses above 6 Gy had greater effects on clonogenicity, a likely consequence of persistent
DNA damage (Fig. 1D).

PARP1 inhibitor ABT-888 markedly enhances IRIF
persistence, suppressing cell proliferation
Treating MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD cells with IR in the presence
of the PARP1 inhibitor ABT-888 (veliparib; 2-[(R)-2-methylpyrrolidin-2-yl]-1H-benzimidazole-4-carboxamide; ref. 13)
prevented PARP activation (Supplementary Fig. S3) and
markedly increased residual IRIF at 3 and 24 hours (Fig. 2A
and B). Neither the GFP-IBD reporter nor ABT-888 seemed to
alter γH2AX localization or the recruitment of MDC1 and endogenous 53BP1 to IRIF (Fig. 2B). Time-lapse live-cell imaging of GFP-IBD revealed that in cells treated with 6 Gy, IRIF
appeared within 15 minutes and began to decrease noticeably by 60 minutes (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S4). However,
after 6 Gy + ABT-888, IRIF continued to appear up to 60 minutes, perhaps via conversion of single-strand breaks to DSBs
(7), but remained largely unchanged thereafter. Previous data
suggest that the growth of IRIF might maintain DNA damage
signaling from unrepaired DSBs (14). Whereas the mean size

of IRIF formed in cells treated with ABT-888 was clearly smaller (Supplementary Fig. S5), the total volume of IRIF per cell at
24 hours with IR + ABT-888 (187 ± 11/μm3) was significantly
greater than that with IR alone (87 ± 10/μm3; P = 0.005, t test).
ABT-888 alone slightly decreased colony formation at
10 μmol/L (100 ± 1% for control versus 88 ± 0.6% for ABT888), but significantly reduced colony formation following
2 Gy (29.7 ± 1.5% for IR alone versus 11.3 ± 0.6% for IR +
ABT-888; P < 0.001, t test), with similar fold reductions at each
IR dose up to 6 Gy. We next examined the potential mechanisms of growth suppression after IR + ABT-888. PARP inhibition did not dramatically affect MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD cell
death after IR. Even 7 days later, few cells exhibited propidium
iodide permeability, suggesting that PARP inhibition might
induce MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD cell cycle arrest rather than apo-

ptosis or necrosis. This is consistent with the previous observation that inhibition of ADP-ribosylation could block
apoptosis, and a transient burst of PARP activity was required
for apoptosis (15). Indeed, whereas ABT-888 alone did not appreciably decrease proliferating cells at 24 hours (58 ± 1%
BrdUrd+ for control versus 56 ± 1% for ABT-888; not shown),
the antiproliferative effects of 3 Gy (41 ± 1%) were enhanced by
ABT-888 (27 ± 1%). In turn, MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD cells treated
with 3 or 6 Gy alone showed a higher recovery of proliferative
capacity compared with IR + ABT-888 (Fig. 2D).

proliferative capacity (16–18). Accelerated senescence following IR has been observed in MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD cells both
in vitro and in vivo (19, 20). At 4 days after IR + ABT-888, cells
displaying persistent GFP-IBD foci began to exhibit a morphology characteristic of senescence. At 7 days, surviving
cells remained adherent, became enlarged with a flat morphology, and displayed multiple nuclear GFP-IBD foci
(Fig. 3A). We investigated other hallmarks of accelerated senescence (16, 17), including SA-βGal staining (Fig. 3B) and
increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
p21Cip1/WAF1 (Fig. 3C). After 6 Gy + ABT-888, 76 ± 4% of surviving cells showed SA-βGal staining compared with 1.2 ±
1.0% for ABT-888 and 2.5 ± 2.0% for 6 Gy (P < 0.001), and
p21Cip1/WAF1 gene expression was significantly upregulated
following IR + ABT-888 compared with IR alone (P < 0.02,
t test). Immunocytochemistry suggested that the accumulation of p21Cip1/WAF1 was greatest in cells with persistent IRIF
(Fig. 3D). Accelerated senescence following IR and ABT-888
treatment was not limited to cells with wild-type p53, as we
observed the same phenotype in MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD cells
treated with p53 inhibitor pifithrin (data not shown), as well
as in breast and other cancer cell lines with mutations in p53
(Supplementary Fig. S6).

ABT-888 accelerates the senescence and suppresses the
growth of irradiated MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD tumors
To visualize IRIF in vivo, MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD cells were injected into nude mice to form xenograft tumors. Imaging of
GFP-IBD by two-photon microscopy revealed that the kinetics of IRIF formation and resolution in tumors were comparable to that observed in MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD cells in vitro
(Fig. 4A). When mice were treated with ABT-888 twice daily
for 2 days before IR and then twice daily thereafter, we observed no increase in IRIF number at early time points but
the number of cells with residual IRIF increased at 24 hours.
Twenty-two percent of tumor cells treated with 3 Gy exhibited ≥4 IRIF/cell whereas 42% of tumor cells with 3 Gy +
ABT-888 had ≥4 IRIF/cell (P < 0.001, t test; Fig. 4B). To evaluate DNA damage–induced senescence in vivo, we examined
SA-βGal staining in frozen tumor sections at 7 days (Fig. 4C).
ABT-888 alone slightly enhanced SA-βGal staining above
background but markedly increased staining when combined
with IR. To compare in vivo growth delay with that observed
in vitro, we performed a tumor regrowth experiment. Mice
bearing MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD tumors were treated with ABT888 for 2 days before a single 6-Gy dose and then only for 2 days
after IR. This short course of PARP inhibition significantly

slowed MCF7Tet-On GFP-IBD tumor regrowth compared with
6 Gy alone [day 9, P = 0.021; day 12, P = 0.013; day 14, P = 0.001
(t test); Fig. 4D].
Our data confirm previously reported enhancement of IR
effects by PARP inhibition (6, 11) and implicate IRIF persistence as a potential mechanism of accelerated tumor cell
senescence. Persistent cell cycle arrest and accelerated senescence are ascribed to accumulation of unrepaired DNA
damage and chromatin perturbation, among other inducers
(17, 18). We speculate that the efficacy of PARP inhibitors toward homologous recombination–deficient BRCA1-, BRCA2-,
or PTEN- negative cancer cells (21) may similarly reflect a cellular response to accumulation of unrepaired endogenous
DNA damage. Indeed, preliminary analysis of the PTEN mutant cell line PC-3 suggests that ABT-888 accelerates senescence, particularly in combination with radiation. Whereas
it remains a dogma that IR and genotoxic agents mediate their
lethal effects via enhanced apoptosis, necrosis, or mitotic catastrophe, senescence is an alternative terminal phenotype
that may be highly relevant as a determinant of outcomes
for cancer treatment (16, 22, 23). Alone or in combination with
other epigenetic drugs such as histone deacetylase inhibitors

that promote IRIF persistence and accelerated senescence
(24), PARP inhibitors may have a significant effect by inducing
senescence as a novel mechanism for sensitization to radiation and chemotherapy.
