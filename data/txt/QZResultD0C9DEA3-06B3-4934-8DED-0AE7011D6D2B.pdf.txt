BACKGROUND. There is paucity of data from developing countries on the efficacy
and safety of imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The primary
DMRT

objective of this study was to document complete and partial cytogenetic
responses to imatinib in all phases of CML. Secondary objectives included
evaluations of complete hematologic response, safety, time to progression, and

survival.

METHODS. Two hundred seventy-five patients in all phases of CML who received
treatment with imatinib from January 2001 to December 2005 were included in
the study. All patients had either Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) on bone marrow
or BCR-ABL positive in peripheral blood by polymerase chain reaction.

RESULTS. After a median follow-up of 18 months, major cytogenetic responses
(Ph < 35%) in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP), and blastic phase (BP)
were documented in 61%, 57%, and 28% of patients, respectively. A complete
cytogenetic response was observed in 39.4%, 35.7%, and 14.3% of patients in
CP, AP, and BP, respectively; and a complete hematologic response was observed
in 90%, 86%, and 30%, respectively. The median time to progression at 18
months was 91% in CP and 68% in AP. The overall survivals in CP, AP, and BP at
18 months was 92%, 74%, and 38%, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS. Impressive hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses to
imatinib were observed, similar to the responses reported in patients from
Western countries. Patients had good compliance, toxicity was limited, and overall quality of life was improved markedly. The results indicated that the biology
of CML is not different in patients from developing countries.

C

hronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a pluripotent stem cell
disorder that is characterized by myeloid hyperplasia in the
bone marrow, leukocytosis in the peripheral blood, and splenomegaly.1–3 The disease progresses through 3 distinct phases—initial chronic
phase (CP), progressing to accelerated phase (AP), and terminating in
blastic phase (BP) and death.4
The hallmark of CML is the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and
its molecular counterpart, the BCR-ABL fusion gene.5,6 This fusion
oncogene generates a protein with tyrosine kinase activity, resulting
in deregulated signal-transduction pathways and causing abnormal
cell cycling, the inhibition of apoptosis, and increased proliferation

of cells.7,8 In CML, Ph chromosome-positive cells
constitute the major portion of all hematopoietic
cells. However, there is also a pool of normal Ph-negative cells.2,9,10 The primary objective of treatment
for CML is eradication of the Ph chromosome-positive clone and restoration of normal Ph-negative
hematopoiesis.
Hydroxyurea previously was the cornerstone of
treatment for CML in CP. It resulted in complete
hematologic response in 50% to 75% of patients and
improved the quality of life, but it did not eliminate the
Ph chromosome-positive clone.11 The median survival in these patients was from 3 years to 6 years.
Interferon a (IFN-a) was used later either alone
or in conjunction with low-dose cytarabine for patients with CML in CP. It produced major cytogenetic
responses in 15% to 25% patients and complete
cytogenetic responses in 10% of patients.12–16
The median survival of patients who received IFN-a
was prolonged to approximately 7 years.17–19 Recent updates from several studies reported 9- or 10year overall survival (OS) rates that ranged from 27%
to 35%.20–24 The superiority of IFN-a over hydroxyurea and busulphan made it the standard of
care.12–14,25–27 However, treatment with IFN was
associated with severe side effects.13,19,28 Allogeneic
stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the only potentially
curative treatment for this disease but is associated
with significant morbidity and mortality (10–
40%).2,13,29 SCT is recommended in young patients
with poor Sokal scores who have a human leucocyte
antigen (HLA)-matched sibling. Data on 10-year follow-up of patients who receiving allogeneic-hematopoietic SCT (allo-HSCT) in first CP had an OS rate of
60% and an event-free survival rate of 50%.21,30,31
Imatinib mesylate is a potent, selective, oral
BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor that has shown substantial activity in all phases of CML 32–36 It functions
through competitive inhibition at the adenosine
triphosphate binding site of the enzyme, which
leads to the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins involved in BCR-ABL signal transduction. 37,38 This results in elimination of the Phpositive clone. Imatinib has highly specific biochemical activity and a safe toxicity profile. Several studies
have now confirmed the superiority of imatinib over
IFN-a,33,39 and it has become the initial standard
of care for all phases of CML in the developed
countries.
There is paucity of data on the clinicoepidemiologic features, response to treatment, and survival in
patients from countries with limited resources who
receive imatinib. Two hundred seventy-five consecutive patients with CML in all disease phases who

1139

participated in our expanded-access imatinib program were included in the current study. The primary
objective of the study was to evaluate complete and
partial cytogenetic responses in patients who received
imatinib. Secondary objectives included evaluations
of complete hematologic response (CHR), safety, time
to progression (TTP), and survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
All patients who presented from January 2001 to
December 2005 were included in the study. Written
informed consent was obtained prior to the start of
the treatment with imatinib. The study was approved
by the institutional ethics committee.
Detection of the Ph chromosome in bone marrow aspirate or a positive BCR-ABL result from a
nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of
peripheral blood or bone marrow was essential prior
to inclusion in the study. Eligibility criteria included
all phases of CML: CP, AP, and BP. All patients who
were diagnosed within 18 months of starting on imatinib were evaluable. Patients were eligible if they had
received prior treatment with hydroxyurea or IFN/
low-dose cytarabine.
All patients underwent a complete history and
physical examination. Laboratory data included complete blood counts with differential, hepatic and renal
profiles, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
Bone marrow for Ph chromosome or BCR-ABL by
nested PCR analysis of peripheral blood or both
were performed at a single laboratory both initially
and on follow-up. Cytogenetics were repeated at
6 months and after 1 year. If the patient had a major
cytogenetic response, then a repeat cytogenetic evaluation was done after 12 to 18 months. Radiology
examination included abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography scanning to determine spleen
size.
The patients were followed at 4-week intervals
with complete blood counts. Women of childbearing
age were required to have a negative pregnancy test.
All patients were required to use barrier contraception
during treatment.
CP was defined by the presence of <5% blasts,
15% to 29% basophils, <30% blasts and promyelocytes in peripheral blood, and no extramedullary
blastic disease. AP was defined as 15% to 20% blasts
in peripheral blood or bone marrow, 20% basophils
in peripheral blood, thrombocytopenia <100,000/
mm3, and 30% blasts and promyelocytes in bone
marrow. BP was defined as 30% blasts in the bone
marrow or extramedullary disease.

Treatment
Imatinib was started with single, daily dose of 400 mg
orally in CP. Dose escalation to between 600 mg and
800 mg daily was carried out in nonresponders or in
patients who had a minor or minimal cytogenetic
response after 6 months. In patients who presented
with CML in AP or BP, the initial starting dose was
600 mg daily up to a maximum of 800 mg. Response
to the treatment was evaluated by physical examinations and complete blood counts every 4 weeks.
Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies for cytogenetics
and morphology were performed initially after 6
months and from 12 months to 18 months thereafter.
Primary Endpoint
The primary study endpoint was the rate of complete/
major cytogenetic response. A complete cytogenetic
response was defined as 0% Ph chromosome-positive
cells in metaphase in bone marrow, and a partial
cytogenetic response was defined as from 0% to
35% Ph chromosome-positive cells in bone marrow.
Other categories included minor responses (36–65%
Ph chromosome-positive cells in bone marrow) and
minimal responses (66–95% Ph chromosome-positive
cells in bone marrow).
Secondary Endpoints
Secondary study endpoints included CHR, TTP, and
OS. A CHR required the disappearance of all signs
and symptoms related to disease, including normalization of blasts counts in the peripheral blood and
bone marrow (5% bone marrow blasts); leucocytes
counts <10,000; normal differential counts without
blasts, promyelocytes, or myelocytes; platelet counts
from 150,00/mm3 to 450,000/mm3; and no evidence
of extramedullary disease.
TTP was defined by any of the following events,
which ever occurred first, from the start of treatment
with imatinib to either death from any cause or disease progression in either AP or BP of CML. Survival
(OS) was calculated from the beginning of treatment
with imatinib to death from any cause.
Hematologic and nonhematologic grades 1 to 4
toxicities were evaluated at each follow-up. Quality
of life was measured by a very basic questionnaire
that included the initial performance status (PS) and
the patient’s ability to go back to the original workplace. It was filled out before the start of imatinib,
then at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months.
Statistical Analysis
SPSS software (version 13.0) was used to perform the
statistical analysis. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used
to calculate the survival curves in all phases of CML,

and the curves were compared by using the log-rank
test. A Sokal score calculator was used to subcategorize the patients into groups with low, intermediate,
and high scores. Linear regression by Pearson correlation was performed to evaluate the following risk
factors in relation to major cytogenetic response and
survival in patients with CML in CP prior to the start
of imatinib: age, white blood cells >100,000/mm3,
platelets <100,000/mm3, spleen size, initial hemoglobin <10 g/dL, the presence of peripheral blasts, basophil level, prior treatment, and Sokal score.

RESULTS
Two hundred seventy-five patients with CML in CP, AP,
and BP were included as part of our expanded-access
imatinib program from January 2001 to December
2005. The patients’ demographic data are provided in
Table 1. The median age of our patients at presentation was 35 years. The ratio of men to women was
approximately 2:1. Two hundred forty patients presented with CML in CP. Prior treatment with IFN and

Treating CML in the Imatinib Era/Aziz et al.

hydroxyurea had been received by 141 patients. The
median duration of follow-up was 18 months (range,
2–45 months). The initial PS ranged between 2 and 3
in 78% patients and was 4 in 20% of patients.
In 66 patients, we were unable to determine the
cytogenetic response because of financial constraints.
These patients were continued on imatinib, because
they had achieved complete hematologic and clinical
responses.
Currently, 237 patients (86.1%) remain alive and
are receiving imatinib. Thirty-three patients have
died, including 22 deaths from progressive disease
and 11 deaths from infections, bleeding, and other
causes.
Figure 1 illustrates the survival of patients with
CML in CP, AP, and BP. The OS rates at 12 months
and 18 months were 95% and 92%, respectively, for
patients in CP and 85% and 74%, respectively, for
patients in AP; 38% of patients in BP remained alive
at 18 months.

Chronic Phase
Two hundred forty patients presented with CML in
CP. They were divided in 2 groups: One group had
received prior treatment with hydroxyurea and/or
IFN, and the second group was comprised of newly
diagnosed patients. Table 2 shows major cytogenetic
responses (complete and partial responses) and CHR
in the 2 groups. We were able to perform cytogenetic
analysis on 188 patients. Figure 2 shows the survival
of all patients in CP according to cytogenetic

response. Major cytogenetic responses were observed
in 78.9% patients with newly diagnosed CML compared with only 44.9% of patients who had received
prior treatment. Similarly, in patients who had lower
Sokal scores, higher major cytogenetic response rates
(70.3%) were observed compared with patients who
had intermediate (56.1%) and high (43.8%) Sokal
scores. Only 10 patients who had a complete cytoge-

netic response underwent testing for BCR-ABL by
nested PCR, and 9 of those patients had a complete
molecular response.
Figure 2 compares the survival of 209 patients
in all phases of CML who underwent cytogenetic
evaluation. Survival was improved significantly in
patients who achieved complete and partial cytogenetic responses (P ¼ .001). At 18 months, 92% of
patients remained alive in CP.
Figure 3 shows the TTP in 240 patients with
CML in CP. At 12 months and 18 months, 94% and
91% of patients, respectively, were free of disease
progression.
Figure 4 shows TTP in chronic phase according
to cytogenetic response. At 12 and 18 months, 99%
and 98% patients who had complete and major cytogenetic responses were free of disease progression
(P ¼ .008).
Significant predictive factors in the linear regression analysis for major cytogenetic response were
splenomegaly (P ¼ .006), initial hemoglobin (P ¼ .03),
white blood count (P ¼ .02), Sokal score (P ¼ .001),
and prior treatment (P ¼ .001). For survival in CP,
the important predictive factors were prior treatment
(P ¼ .05), hemoglobin (P ¼ .007), cytogenetic response (P ¼ .001), and Sokal score (P ¼ .05). For TTP,
the significant predictive factors were prior treatment
(P ¼ .01), cytogenetic responses (P ¼ .004), and hemoglobin (P ¼ .05).
Quality of life was gauged according to the initial
PS and the patient’s ability to go back to their workplace. Twelve months after starting imatinib, the
PS improved to 0 or 1, and 90% of patients went

back to their workplace. No patient underwent
allogeneic SCT or was willing to undergo allogeneic
SCT.

Accelerated Phase
Twenty-two patients (8.1%) presented with CML in AP,
including 19 patients who had a CHR. In 14 patients, a
cytogenetic response was determined. Complete and
partial cytogenetic responses were observed in
5 patients (35.7%) and 3 patients (21.4%), respectively.

each. In 5 patients who received 800 mg of imatinib,
treatment had to be withheld and was resumed at
400 mg once the counts improved. Significant grade
3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities were myalgias/
cramps (25.7%) and nausea/vomiting (20.0%). No
dose reductions/modifications were required for nonhematologic toxicities.

DISCUSSION

CP indicates chronic phase; AP, accelerated phase; BP, blastic phase.

At 18 months, 68% of patients still had not progressed
to blast crisis, and 74% patients remained alive and still
had not reached their median survival.

Blastic Phase
There were 13 patients who presented in blast crisis.
Of these, 4 patients achieved a CHR. Cytogenetic
analyses were performed in 7 patients, and only 1
patient had a complete cytogenetic response. A partial response was observed in 1 patient. At 18 months,
38% patients remained alive. For patients in blast crisis, the median survival was 10 months (95% confidence interval, 7–12.9 months); at 18 months, 38% of
patients remained alive.
Safety Profile
Imatinib was generally well tolerated in our patients.
The frequencies of grade 1 through 4 adverse events
that were attributable to imatinib are summarized in
Table 3, which shows that no grade 3 or 4 hematologic or nonhematologic toxicities were observed in
patients with CML in CP who received imatinib at a
dose of 400 mg. There were no dose discontinuations
or modification in these patients.
Among patients in AP/blast crisis and patients
who received from 600 mg to 800 mg of imatinib,
grade 1 and 2 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were observed in 17.1%, 28.5%, and 34.2% of
patients, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 anemia was
observed in 5.7% patients, whereas neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia were observed in 14.2% of patients

Because of the paucity of data from developing countries, we conducted the current study to determine
the efficacy and safety of imatinib in our patients
with CML. Secondary endpoints of the study were
TTP and survival. Impressive responses with imatinib
mesylate were documented at hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular levels in all disease phases.
No reports are available from developing countries on the clinicoepidemiologic features, cytogenetic
responses, and survival of patients with CML who
receive hydroxyurea or interferon. We could identify
only 1 study from Brazil that reported results on imatinib in patients with CML.40
Our patient population is not a selective population, because >95% of patients with CML across our
country participate in 4 expanded-access programs.
Most of our patients on IFN were unable to tolerate
the recommended doses because of severe side
effects. None of these patients had a cytogenetic response before they started imatinib.
There were some differences between our patient
population and the patients reported in Phase II and
III studies from developed countries. Unlike reports
from high-resource countries,33,39 the median age of
our patients was only 35 years, which was similar to
the median age of patients in the Brazilian study.40
Shorter life expectancy in developing countries41 or
under diagnosis in the geriatric population may
account for the younger age of our patients.
Major cytogenetic responses on the order of
61.2% were noted in patients with CML in CP, and
those results were in concordance with the results of
Kantarjian et al.32 Similar to other reports,34,42 newly
diagnosed patients and patients with low Sokal scores
had superior major cytogenetic responses (Table 2);
however, because of the short duration of follow-up,
we were unable to comment on progression-free
survival and OS.
Because of the financial constraints of our patients, molecular remissions were documented by
BCR-ABL in only 9 of 10 patients who achieved a
complete response. Significant predictive factors for
major cytogenetic responses were Sokal score, initial
hemoglobin splenomegaly, white blood count, and

1144

prior treatment. For survival in CP, significant predictive factors were prior treatment, hemoglobin, cytogenetic response, and Sokal score. For TTP, significant
predictive factors were prior treatment, cytogenetic
responses, and hemoglobin.
In the patients with CML in AP and BP, major
cytogenetic responses and superior survival were
similar to those reported by others.34,40,43 Our higher
response rates in patients with blast crisis may have
been because of small patient numbers, younger age,
early presentation, and less clonally evolved disease.
Consistent with the report by Drucker et al,36
grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities were observed
in patients who received imatinib at a dose of
800 mg. This probably reflects severely compromised
bone marrow function. Frequent grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicity were nausea, vomiting, and
edema. Despite these toxicities, we were able to treat
most patients on an outpatient basis, which probably
contributed to markedly improved quality of life and
satisfaction.
Imatinib was tolerated well in our patients with
good compliance. We were able to give 400 mg
imatinib to all of our patients in CP with no dose
interruptions or modifications. No grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities were observed in CP. Some
reasons may be the younger ages of our patients and
their limited access to our cancer clinics, because
>50% of patients live 150 kilometers from our center, which may cause patients to report toxicities to
their local physicians. Overall quality of life is improved markedly, as also reported by the International Randomized Interferon versus ST1571 Study
Group.44 Greater than 90% of patients with CML in
CP have gone back to work. Patients in AP started
working once they achieved CHR and a good PS. No
patient with CML in BP has gone back to work.
In our patient cohort, no patient underwent or is
likely to undergo allo-HSCT because of economic
hardship. The significant post-transplantation morbidity and mortality from overcrowding, poor hygienic conditions, access to the treatment center, and
limited finances do not allow us to recommend alloHSCT to the vast majority of our patients, even if an
HLA-identical donor is available. The limited availability of treatment options will allow us to document the natural disease progression of our patients
who are receiving imatinib over time. In addition,
the duration of follow-up is too short for us to comment on the survival of our patients.
We realize that our study has several weaknesses,
because we were unable to document molecular
remissions in most of our patients. We also were
unable to perform PCR on our patients with mole-

cular remissions for levels of BCR-ABL transcripts to
evaluate disease prognosis,45 because this test was
not available. Cytogenetic studies could not be done
in 24% patients to assess response because of financial problems. However, our report is one of the few
reports from a developing country on the efficacy
and survival of patients with CML on imatinib. Our
results show that the biology of this disease is not
different in patients from developing countries, and
the response to imatinib in these patients is similar
to that observed in patients from high-resource
countries.
