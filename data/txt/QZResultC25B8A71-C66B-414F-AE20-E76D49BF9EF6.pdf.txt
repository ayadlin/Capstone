Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Breast carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide with an
estimated 1.38 million new cases and 458,000 deaths in 2008 alone1. This malignancy represents a
heterogeneous group of tumours with characteristic molecular features, prognosis, and responses
to available therapy2–4. Recurrent somatic alterations in breast cancer have been described
including mutations and copy number alterations, notably ERBB2 amplifications, the first
successful therapy target defined by a genomic aberration5. Prior DNA sequencing studies of
breast cancer genomes have revealed additional candidate mutations and gene
rearrangements 6–10. Here we report the whole-exome sequences of DNA from 103 human breast
cancers of diverse subtypes from patients in Mexico and Vietnam compared to matched-normal
DNA, together with whole-genome sequences of 22 breast cancer/normal pairs. Beyond
confirming recurrent somatic mutations in PIK3CA11, TP536, AKT112, GATA313, and MAP3K110,
we discovered recurrent mutations in the CBFB transcription factor gene and deletions of its
partner RUNX1. Furthermore, we have identified a recurrent MAGI3-AKT3 fusion enriched in
triple-negative breast cancer lacking estrogen and progesterone receptors and ERBB2 expression.
The Magi3-Akt3 fusion leads to constitutive activation of Akt kinase, which is abolished by
treatment with an ATP-competitive Akt small-molecule inhibitor.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Breast cancers are classified according to gene-expression subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B,
Her2-enriched, and basal-like14. Luminal subtypes are associated with expression of
estrogen (ER+) and progesterone (PR+) receptors and differentiated luminal epithelial cell
markers. The subtypes differ in genomic complexity, key genetic alterations, and clinical
prognosis2–4,15. To discover genomic alterations in breast cancers, we performed wholegenome and whole-exome sequencing of 108 primary, treatment naive, breast carcinoma/
normal DNA pairs from all major expression subtypes (Table 1; Supplementary Table 1–3),
17 cases by whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, 5 cases by whole-genome
sequencing alone, and 86 cases by whole-exome sequencing alone.
In total, whole-exome sequencing was performed on 103 tumour-normal pairs, 54 from
Mexico and 49 from Vietnam, targeting 189,980 exons comprising 33 megabases of the
genome and with a median of 85.1% of targeted bases covered at least 30-fold across the
sample set. This analysis revealed a total of 4,985 candidate somatic substitutions (see

and insertions/deletions (indels: see https://confluence.broadinstitute.org/display/CGATools/
Indelocator for methods) in the target protein-coding regions and the adjacent splice sites,
ranging from 14 to 307 putative events in individual samples (Supplementary Table 4).
These mutations represented 3,153 missense, 1,157 silent, 242 nonsense, 97 splice site, 194
deletions, 110 insertions and 32 other mutations (Supplementary Table 5). The total
mutation rate was 1.66 per Mb (range 0.47–10.5) with a non-silent mutation rate of 1.27 per
Mb (range 0.31–8.05), similar to previous reports in breast carcinoma6–9. The mutation rate
in breast cancer exceeds that of hematologic malignancies and prostate cancer but is
significantly lower than in lung cancer and melanoma10,16–19. The most common mutation
events observed are C to T transition events in CpG dinucleotides (Figure 1, Supplementary
Figure 4).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We performed validation experiments on 494 candidate mutations (representing all
significantly mutated genes and genes in significantly mutated genesets) using a
combination of mass-spectrometric genotyping, 454 pyrosequencing, Pacific Biosciences
sequencing, and Illumina sequencing of matched formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue,
and confirmed the presence of 94% of protein-altering point mutations (Supplementary
Table 4, Supplementary Figure 5); this validation rate is consistent with previous results that
95% of point mutations can be validated with orthogonal methods16,17. Only 18 of 39 (46%)
indels among significantly mutated genes were confirmed.
Six genes were found to be mutated with significant recurrence in the 103 whole exome
sequenced samples, by analysis with the MutSig algorithm16,17 (https://
confluence.broadinstitute.org/display/CGATools/MutSig) at a False Discovery Rate (FDR)
<0.1 after correction for multiple hypothesis testing (Supplementary Table 6A), manual
review of reads, and subsequent orthogonal confirmation of somatic events (Figure 1,
Supplementary Figure 6). One gene, CBFB is identified for the first time as a significantly
mutated gene in breast cancer or any other epithelial cancer, to our knowledge, while the
other 5 genes (TP53, PIK3CA, AKT1, GATA3, and MAP3K1) have previously been reported
as mutated in breast cancer7,10,13. This significantly mutated genes list, as any list produced
by a statistical method, is likely incomplete and reflects the statistical power of our cohort
size -- larger sample sets will provide further statistical power.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Somatic mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA were each present in 27% of samples, consistent
with published frequencies10,20 (Figure 1). TP53 mutations occur in samples with a higher
mutation rate (T-test p = 0.0079 comparing samples with mutation rates greater than or less
than the median 1.66 mutations/Mb) and were distributed across the gene in sites reported in
COSMIC (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/). Also, using the ABSOLUTE
algorithm for determining allele-specific copy number (Carter et al. manuscript submitted),
we observed that 21 of 31 TP53 mutations were homozygous (Supplementary Table 4).
PIK3CA mutations were clustered in the helical (amino acids 542/545; 40%) and kinase
domains (amino acid 1047; 47%)20. Six samples harboured the AKT1 E17K mutation that
alters the pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain and leads to activation of the kinase12. AKT1
and PIK3CA mutations, which activate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway,
were mutually exclusive in our dataset. MAP3K1, recently reported as mutated in ER+ breast

cancers10, harboured 5 mutations in 3 patients with ER+ disease, and followed a pattern
consistent with positive selection for recessive inactivation of the gene. In total, 2
frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 1 missense mutation combined with a homozygous deletion
spanning the coding region were observed. Although the point mutations appeared to be
heterozygous by copy-number analysis, two patients harboured dual mutations, consistent
with compound heterozygous inactivation, although confirmatory phasing data were not
available. The GATA3 transcription factor gene harboured mutations in 4 patients with
luminal tumours, including 3 novel frameshift mutations near the 3′-end of the coding
sequence. We also identified one previously described splice-site mutation that disrupts
zinc-finger domains in Gata3 required for DNA binding13.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CBFB, encoding the core-binding-factor beta subunit, was mutated in 4 ER+ samples, with
one nonsense mutation and three truncating frameshift mutations (Figure 2A). CBFB
somatic mutations have been noted in isolated cases of breast cancer6,10. This is the first
report of these mutations recurring at a significant rate above background; the sample size is
not sufficient to determine whether these mutations are specific for ER+ subtypes. CBFB
encodes the non-DNA binding component of a heterodimeric protein complex, together with
the DNA-binding RUNX proteins encoded by RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3. Copy-number
analysis, using the ABSOLUTE algorithm (Carter et al., manuscript submitted), provides
further evidence for loss of function of the Runx1/Cbfb complex in breast cancer: the cases
with CBFB mutations appear to have hemizygous deletions of one parental allele while two
additional cases harbour homozygous deletions of RUNX1 (Figure 2B, 2C, Supplementary
Figures 7,8). Oncogenic rearrangements of RUNX1 or CBFB are common in acute myeloid
leukemia21,22 (including the CBFB-MYH11 translocation believed to have dominant
negative function21). This is to our knowledge the first report of inactivation of this
transcription factor complex in epithelial cancers.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Significance analysis restricted to somatic mutations in genes reported in COSMIC revealed
3 significantly mutated genes, including PIK3CA, TP53, and ERBB2, the latter below the
significance threshold in the complete analysis (Supplementary Table 7). ERBB2 contained
somatic mutations in three samples, with two being identical S310F mutations (these two
samples are distinct based on their germline and somatic genotypes.) The S310F mutation
can activate ERBB2 and is transforming in vitro (personal communication from H.
Greulich). Neither sample with the S310F activating mutation has ERBB2 amplification
(Supplementary Figure 9). The two samples belong to the Her2-enriched and Luminal B
subtypes, which typically have ERBB2 amplification; this supports the notion that the
observed mutations have a driving role in these tumours10,23.
To identify candidate genomic rearrangements, we applied the dRanger algorithm16,17 to the
22 cases with paired tumour/normal whole-genome sequencing data (Supplementary Table
8). The rate of rearrangements ranged from a median of 30 rearrangements per sample in the
Luminal A subtype (range 0–218) to the basal-like and Her2-enriched subtypes with a
median of 237 and 246 rearrangements, respectively (Supplementary Figure 10); the rates
are similar to a recent report15. We performed PCR amplification on a subset of the
candidate rearrangements (Supplementary Methods) and confirmed 89 of 165 events (54%).
No rearrangement was seen in more than one sample (Supplementary Table 8). In addition,

we did not identify rearrangements previously observed by DNA sequencing15 nor by
cDNA-sequencing, including MAST and Notch family-gene fusions24.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The discovery of recurrent driver rearrangements in other epithelial cancers25,26 led to a
closer examination of the list of confirmed rearrangements. In a triple-negative, basal-like
subtype tumour, we observed a rearrangement between the genes MAGI3 (membrane
associated guanylate kinase, WW and PDZ domain containing 3) on chromosome 1p and
AKT3 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 3) on chromosome 1q, resulting in a
balanced translocation from intron 9 in MAGI3 to intron 1 of AKT3 (Figure 3A). The novel
fusion genes were confirmed in tumour DNA by sequencing the product of PCR
amplification (Figure 3B). The MAGI3 disruption is complemented by a hemizygous
deletion of the other allele (Supplementary Figure 11A). The expression levels of individual
exons of MAGI3 and AKT3 correspond to the predicted 5′-MAGI3-AKT3-3′ fusion
(Supplementary Figure 11B), with this sample having the highest AKT3 expression in the
dataset. Expression of the fusion gene was confirmed in the tumour sample by PCR
amplification of the cDNA (Figure 3B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The rearrangement produces an in-frame fusion gene with a predicted Magi3-Akt3 fusion
protein that combines Magi3 lacking the second PDZ domain, reported to bind to Pten and
be required for Pten’s inhibitory effect on the PI3K pathway27, together with an Akt3 region
that retains an intact kinase domain but has a disruption of the pleckstrin homology domain
prior to the glutamate at position 17 (Figure 3C). AKT3 shares significant homology to
AKT1 and is reported to be the dominant AKT family member expressed in hormone
receptor negative breast cancers28. Together, the MAGI3-AKT3 translocation and deletion of
MAGI3 could result in the combined loss of function of a tumour suppressor gene (PTEN)
and activation of an oncogene (AKT3).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To evaluate oncogenic activity of the MAGI3-AKT3 fusion, we expressed the fusion gene
ectopically in ZR-75 cells. The Magi3-Akt3 fusion protein is constitutively phosphorylated
at serine 473 in the Akt3 kinase domain (numbered according to the wild-type protein) in the
absence of growth factors (Figure 3D); ectopically expressed Akt1 with an engineered E17K
mutation is likewise constitutively phosphorylated (Figure 3D), as previously reported12.
Constitutive activation of the Magi3-Akt3 kinase in turn activates downstream pathways as
demonstrated by phosphorylation of GSK3β, an Akt substrate (Figure 3D). Phosphorylation
of GSK3β by the MAGI3-AKT3 fusion can be inhibited with an ATP-competitive small
molecule Akt inhibitor, GSK-690693, but not with an allosteric Akt inhibitor, MK-2206,
that interacts with the PH domain of Akt (Figure 3D). Over-expression of the MAGI3-AKT3
fusion gene in Rat-1 fibroblast cell lines led to loss of contact inhibition and focus formation
(Figure 3E).
We screened 235 additional breast cancer samples for the presence of the 5′-MAGI3AKT3-3′ fusion event by RT-PCR of cDNA followed by Sanger sequencing of breakpoints.
The fusion was present in 8 of the 235 samples, including 5 out of 72 triple negative
(ER−/PR−/Her2−) samples, (Supplementary Figure 12).

The power provided by whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of a relatively large
and diverse breast cancer sample set has enabled several significant discoveries including
the identification of recurrent inactivating mutations in CBFB and of a recurrent
translocation of MAGI3-AKT3. The mutations in CBFB, RUNX1 and GATA3 suggest the
importance of understanding epithelial cell differentiation and its regulatory transcription
factors in breast cancer pathogenesis. The recurrent genomic fusion involving AKT3
suggests that the use of ATP-competitive Akt inhibitors should be evaluated in clinical trials
for the treatment of fusion-positive triple-negative breast cancers, a subtype where limited
therapeutic options exist beyond systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Methods Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All samples were obtained under institutional IRB approval and with documented informed
consent. Breast cancer specimens from Mexico were paired with peripheral blood normal
DNA while the Vietnamese samples were paired with DNA from normal adjacent breast
tissue. Tumour RNA for each case was analysed on exon arrays to determine breast cancer
expression subtype using the PAM50 classification method, while tumour/normal DNA
pairs were analysed for copy number, allelic imbalance, and ancestry using SNP arrays. A
total of 108 samples, 17 both WGS and WES, 86 WES only, and 5 WGS only, passed initial
qualification metrics, library construction, and successfully achieved desired sequencing
depth (100X WES; 30X WGS) on the Illumina sequencing platform (Supplementary Figures
1–3; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Tumour-specific point mutations, small insertions/
deletions (indels), and rearrangements were detected by comparing tumour DNA to its
paired normal DNA and using a series of algorithms to identify somatic events
(Supplementary Figure 2)16,17. Additional mutation calling was performed separately on
tumour and normal DNA to identify germline mutation events that may confer susceptibility
to breast carcinoma. Allele-specific copy number of each gene/mutation was determined
using the HAPSEG and ABSOLUTE analysis methods. Confirmation of point mutations
and indels was performed using mass spectrometry based genotyping and orthogonal nextgeneration sequencing methods, whereas putative in-frame genomic rearrangements were
PCR amplified from DNA to confirm the presence of the event.

Figure 1. Most significantly-mutated genes in breast cancer as determined by whole exome
sequencing (n=103)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Upper histogram: rates of sample-specific mutations (substitutions and indels), green =
synonymous, blue = non-synonymous.
Left histogram: number of mutations per gene and percentage of samples affected (colour
coding as in upper histogram).
Central heatmap: Distribution of significant mutations across sequenced samples (“Other
non synonymous” mutations = nonsense, indel, splice-site).
Right histogram: -log10 score of MutSig q value. Red line at q = 0.1.
Lower chart: top - rates of non-silent mutations within categories indicated by legend;
bottom - key molecular features of samples in each column (Expression subtypes: “Lum” =
luminal. Histology: “Duct.” = Infiltrating ductal carcinoma, “DCIS” = Ductal carcinoma in
situ, “Lob.” = Infiltrating lobular carcinoma).

Figure 2. CBFB mutations and RUNX1 deletions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A. CBFB coding region diagram: RUNX binding domain in green. Mutations identified in
this study (red bullets), previously identified mutations6,10 (black bullets), and known
CBFB-MYH11 fusion indicated.
B. Allelic copy ratios for the 3 Mb region surrounding RUNX1 in samples BR-M-045 and
BR-M-174. Dots indicate copy-ratios for individual SNP alleles: Red = higher copy-ratio
allele for informative SNPs that are heterozygous in matched normal DNA; Blue = lowercopy ratio SNPs; Grey = uninformative SNPs (homozygous in matched normal).
Lines indicate inferred segmental copy-ratios. Red = higher copy segment; Blue = lower
copy segment; Purple = equal copy segment.
C. Histogram depicting bins of segmented copy number (y-axis), with inferred integral
copies shown by dotted lines; the length of each horizontal block corresponds to the fraction
of the haploid genome at the copy number level, or “genomic fraction” (x-axis).
