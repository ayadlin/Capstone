Oxidation-Mediated DNA Cross-Linking Contributes to the
Toxicity of 6-Thioguanine in Human Cells
Reto Brem and Peter Karran

Abstract
The thiopurines azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine have been extensively prescribed as immunosuppressant
and anticancer agents for several decades. A third member of the thiopurine family, 6-thioguanine (6-TG), has
been used less widely. Although known to be partly dependent on DNA mismatch repair (MMR), the cytotoxicity
of 6-TG remains incompletely understood. Here, we describe a novel MMR-independent pathway of 6-TG toxicity.
Cell killing depended on two properties of 6-TG: its incorporation into DNA and its ability to act as a source of
reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS targeted DNA 6-TG to generate potentially lethal replication-arresting DNA
lesions including interstrand cross-links. These triggered processing by the Fanconi anemia and homologous
recombination DNA repair pathways. Allopurinol protected against 6-TG toxicity by acting as a ROS scavenger
and preventing DNA damage. Together, our ﬁndings provide mechanistic evidence to support the proposed use of
thiopurines to treat HR-defective tumors and for the coadministration of 6-TG and allopurinol as an immunomodulation strategy in inﬂammatory disorders. Cancer Res; 72(18); 4787–95. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The clinical effectiveness of the immunosuppressant, antiinﬂammatory and anticancer thiopurines: azathioprine, 6mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG) relies on
their ability to selectively kill dividing immune effector or
cancer cells. Surprisingly, despite successful use for over 50
years (1), the mechanisms by which they cause the death of
their target cells are still incompletely understood. Thiopurines
are prodrugs. They are metabolized to the 6-TG nucleotides
(TGN) that early studies identiﬁed as important determinants
of toxicity. TGN are substrates for incorporation into DNA and
the accumulation of DNA 6-TG is a major factor in thiopurine
toxicity. Other contributors include the formation of toxic
thiopurine metabolites and oxidation of DNA 6-TG by exogenous chemicals or ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation (for review
see ref. 2).
The most widely prescribed thiopurines, 6-MP and its
prodrug azathioprine, are converted to TGN in several steps
(for review see ref. 3). Conversion is counteracted by the
activities of 3 enzymes: thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT),
which inactivates thiopurines by methylation (4), xanthine
oxidase (XO), which catabolizes 6-MP and azathioprine to
inactive thiouric acid, and the MRP4 transporter protein that

exports thiopurine mononucleotides from cells (5). TPMT
expression is an important determinant of the clinical effectiveness of thiopurines. Polymorphic TPMT variants with
signiﬁcantly reduced activity are associated with high TGN
levels and extreme, potentially lethal, thiopurine toxicity. High
TPMT activity is associated with lower intracellular TGN
concentrations and reduced clinical efﬁcacy (6). Prevention
of cell proliferation by limiting the supply of purine nucleotides
that are essential for DNA and RNA synthesis is another
potential contributor to thiopurine toxicity. In this case, TPMT
methylates thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP), a metabolite
of azathioprine and 6-MP, to generate methyl-TIMP, a powerful inhibitor of the ﬁrst enzyme in the de novo pathway of
purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Purine nucleotide depletion
does not explain all thiopurine cytotoxicity, however, (7) and
the potently cytotoxic 6-TG is metabolized to TGN by a
different route that does not generate TIMP.
The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system is also a major
contributor to thiopurine toxicity. DNA 6-TG deceives MMR
into a potentially lethal intervention and, as a consequence
MMR-defects confer signiﬁcant thiopurine resistance (for
review see ref. 8). MMR-deﬁcient cells do, however, retain a
susceptibility to killing by high thiopurine concentrations,
indicating the existence of MMR-independent thiopurine cytotoxicity (9).
DNA 6-TG is also implicated in a cytotoxic pathway, which
involves oxidative DNA damage. Cells containing DNA 6-TG
are hypersensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated
chemically, biologically (10), or photochemically by UVA (11).
ROS inﬂict widespread DNA damage. In addition to the wellcharacterized DNA 8-oxoGuanine (12), they cause oxidation of
DNA 6-TG itself. Among these oxidation products, guanine-6
sulfonate (GSO3; ref. 11) and guanine-sulﬁnate (GSO2; ref. 13),
DNA interstrand cross-links (ICL; ref. 14), and DNA-protein

cross-links (15) have been identiﬁed as replication-blocking
and potentially cytotoxic DNA lesions.
Here we describe 6-TG-mediated cytotoxicity that requires
the incorporation of 6-TG into DNA but is independent of
MMR, exogenous sources of ROS, and of UVA. It does require an
oxidizing environment, however, and we show that 6-TG itself
provides this by depleting endogenous antioxidant defenses
and thereby increasing steady-state ROS levels. Cell killing
reﬂects the formation of potentially lethal DNA lesions that
inhibit replication. Its effects are particularly marked in cells
with defects in the Fanconi anemia (FA) and homologous
recombination (HR) pathways and cells with defects in either
pathway are extremely sensitive to 6-TG (9, 14, 16). Together
the FA and HR pathway protect cells against DNA damage that
arrests replication (reviewed in ref. 17). FA-deﬁcient cells are
typically hypersensitive to killing, chromosome breakage and
particularly to radial chromosome induction by agents that
cause DNA ICLs. They exhibit a similar pattern of sensitivity to
6-TG (14), and we show that ICLs are among the DNA lesions
that efﬁciently block DNA replication in cells treated with 6-TG.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The MMR-defective human leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM
was grown in RPMI, all other cells in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum. The Fanconi anemia (FANCA/) and wild-type
(FANCAþ/þ) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) have been
described (18). Their status was conﬁrmed by isoenzyme
analysis and DNA ﬁngerprinting (January 2010). MSH2-defective (HeLa-MSH2) and their control transfectant HeLa SilenciX
(HeLa-SX) cells (tebu-bio Cat Nr 01-00023) were cultured in the
presence of hygromycin B. Nontransfected HeLa and MLH1deﬁcient colon cancer cells HCT116 were obtained from
Cancer Research UK Central Cell Services. Their identity was
conﬁrmed by isoenzyme analysis and short tandem repeat
proﬁling (March 2011) and skin ﬁbroblasts derived from a
Lesch-Nyhan syndrome patient (GM03467) (isoenzyme analysis November 2010) were obtained from The Coriell Institute
(Camden, NJ).
ROS and glutathione detection
To measure ROS, trypsinized cells were washed once in PBS
and incubated in 5 mmol/L CM-H2DCFDA (Invitrogen) in PBS
for 20 minutes at 37 C. They were then washed twice in PBS
and green ﬂuorescence was analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Total
and oxidized levels of glutathione (GSH) were measured using
the Glutathione Assay (Trevigen) according to the manufacturer's protocols.
Immunoblotting
Whole cell extracts were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Proteins (50 mg) were separated on 3%
to 8% Tris-acetate polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). After
transfer, membranes were probed with antibodies against
FANCD2 (Novus Biologicals), MSH2 (BD Pharmingen), or XO
(Abcam). Antigen–antibody complexes were visualized using
ECL blotting detection agent (GE Healthcare).

RNA interference
The siRNA duplex smart pools were purchased from Dharmacon. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Invitrogen) or Dharmafect (Dharmacon) according to the
manufacturers' instructions, with a ﬁnal siRNA concentration
of 50 nmol/L. Cells were subcultured into normal medium 24
hours after transfection.
Cell survival, comet assay, 3H-thymidine incorporation
To determine cell survival, treated cells were seeded into 96well plates (1,000 cells per well) in normal medium. Viability
was assayed 5 days later using the MTT assay. For clonal
survival, 500 cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates and
colonies were counted 7 to 10 days later. Each analysis was
carried out in triplicate.
DNA interstrand cross-linking was determined by the comet
assay. Cells were grown in the presence of 6-TG for 48 hours.
They were then irradiated with 5 Gy IR and lysed. Following 2
hours digestion at 37 C with 1 mg/mL Proteinase K (Roche)
they were analyzed by the alkaline comet assay as described
(19).
DNA replication was assessed by measuring [3H]-thymidine
incorporation. Cells were treated with 6-TG and then pulsed
with [50 3H]thymidine (1 mCi/mL, 511 GBq/mmol) in normal
medium for 30 minutes. Trichloroacetic acid insoluble radioactivity in duplicate samples of 2  106 cells was determined by
scintillation counting.

Results
MMR-independent 6-TG sensitivity
Cells derived from FA patients are surprisingly sensitive to
thiopurines (16). An early study (20) reported that FANCGdefective Chinese hamster ovary cells are even more sensitive
to 6-TG than to acknowledged ICL-inducing agents such as
mitomycin C and diepoxybutane. This extreme 6-TG sensitivity
was also apparent in FANCA/ MEFs that were more than
four-fold more sensitive to 6-TG than their FANCAþ/þ counterparts (Fig. 1A). FA-defective human cells were also hypersensitive to 6-TG. siRNA-mediated depletion of FANCD2, a key
component of the FA pathway, signiﬁcantly increased 6-TG
sensitivity of HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). Importantly, FANCD2 silencing in MMR-deﬁcient HCT116 cells also resulted in 6-TG
hypersensitivity (Fig. 1C), indicating that the FA pathway
provides protection against the cytotoxicity of 6-TG that is
partly independent of MMR.
MMR-independent activation of the FA pathway by 6-TG
Monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein is a sensitive
indicator of FA pathway activation by replication-arresting
DNA damage. Western blotting revealed that 6-TG treatment
induced this FANCD2 modiﬁcation in both MMR-proﬁcient
and MMR-defective cells. FANCD2 monoubiquitination was
apparent in MMR-defective HeLa-MSH2 and HCT116 cells
following treatment with 6-TG concentrations of 0.8 mmol/L
and above—approximately 2- to 3-fold higher than the concentrations required to trigger FANCD2 activation in MMRproﬁcient HeLa-SX cells (Fig. 2). We conclude that 6-TG
treatment activates the FA pathway and that activation is

6-TG sensitivity and FA activation: the role of ROS
FACS analysis of cells stained with CM-H2DCFD, a reporter for ROS, revealed that 6-TG treatment induced a dosedependent increase in intracellular ROS (Fig. 3A). The purine

www.aacrjournals.org

catabolizing enzyme XO detoxiﬁes mercaptopurine in a
reaction that generates ROS, although its role in 6-TG
catabolism is less clear. We investigated whether XO was
the source of the ROS produced by 6-TG. When HCT116 cells
were treated with 6-TG in the presence of allopurinol, an
acknowledged XO inhibitor (21), ROS levels declined to those
of untreated cells (Fig. 3B). The lower ROS levels in allopurinol-treated HCT116 cells were associated with a signiﬁcantly reduced 6-TG sensitivity. Whereas treatment with 0.8
mmol/L 6-TG for 48 hours reduced cell viability to <50%,
inclusion of allopurinol reversed this toxicity and cell survival was comparable to that following treatment with
allopurinol alone (Fig. 3C). Allopurinol also signiﬁcantly
increased the concentration of 6-TG required to trigger
MMR-independent FANCD2 ubiquitination. In the absence
of allopurinol, monoubiquitinated FANCD2 was detectable
in extracts of HCT116 cells treated with 0.4 mmol/L 6-TG.
When 6-TG treatment was carried out in the presence of
allopurinol, FANCD2 was not detectably ubiquitinated even
after treatment with 1.2 mmol/L 6-TG (Fig. 3D). Allopurinol
also protected MSH2-deﬁcient CCRF-CEM cells against
FANCD2 activation (data not shown).
Allopurinol is a powerful XO inhibitor at micromoles per
liter concentrations. In our experiments, however, protection
against 6-TG toxicity and FANCD2 modiﬁcation required its
inclusion at millimoles per liter levels. This suggested that
its effect was not a consequence of XO inhibition. To examine
this possibility, cells were treated with 6-TG in the presence or
absence of an alternative XO inhibitor, febuxostat (22). Febuxostat concentrations up to 200 mmol/L had no detectable effect
on ROS levels, FANCD2 ubiquitination or HCT116 cell survival
(data not shown), conﬁrming that XO was not the source of
ROS. In addition, Western blotting and direct assays of XO
activity indicated that, with the exception of HeLa cells, XO was
undetectable in cultured cells including HCT116, CCRF-CEM
and several lymphoblastoid cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1).
These ﬁndings indicate that allopurinol protection against
6-TG is independent of its ability to inhibit XO. It therefore
most likely reﬂects the ability of allopurinol to act as a ROS
scavenger.
Because 6-TG metabolism by XO was excluded as a possible
source of ROS, we examined whether 6-TG increased ROS
levels by depleting antioxidant protection. GSH is one of the
most important cellular antioxidants. Figure 4A shows that
6-TG induces a dose-dependent reduction of GSH levels in both
HCT116 and HeLa-MSH2 cells. The depletion was exacerbated
by cotreatment with buthionine sulfoxide (BSO), a GSH
synthesis inhibitor that prevents GSH replenishment. BSO and
allopurinol had opposite effects. In HeLa-MSH2 cells, BSO
potentiated 6-TG mediated ROS formation (Fig. 4B). It was
associated with FANCD2 monoubiquitination at lower 6TG concentrations (Fig. 4C) and an enhanced sensitivity to
killing by 6-TG (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained in
HCT116 cells (data not shown). We conclude that 6-TG treatment increases steady-state ROS levels by depleting the levels
of protective GSH. The ensuing oxidative stress results in the
formation of potentially lethal DNA lesions that activate the
FA pathway.

cells also induced ROS (Fig. 5A). The survival of GM03467
cells was completely unaffected by 6-TG concentrations
that induced ROS at levels that caused signiﬁcant lethality
in HCT116 cells indicating that 6-TG-induced oxidative
stress is insufﬁcient in itself to cause cell death. Importantly, 6-TG treatment did not induce detectable activation
of FANCD2 in GM03467 cells—even at extremely high
concentrations. The FA pathway was functional in these
cells, however, and FANCD2 ubiquitination was detectable
following mitomycin C treatment (Fig. 5B). Conﬁrmation
that DNA damage derived from incorporated 6-TG is
required to trigger the FA pathway and is responsible for
6-TG induced cytotoxicity, was provided by GM03467 cells
in which FANCD2 was down-regulated by RNA interference.
Abrogation of the FA pathway did not detectably alter their
6-TG sensitivity. It did, however, signiﬁcantly sensitize them
to mitomycin C (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these ﬁndings
indicate that both DNA 6-TG and ROS are required to
generate potentially lethal DNA lesions that activate the
FA pathway.
The lethal DNA 6-TG lesions
The FA pathway is activated by replication-arresting DNA
lesions. 6-TG treatment induced a dose-dependent inhibition
of DNA replication as assessed by [3H]-thymidine incorporation into nascent DNA (Fig. 6A). Inhibition occurred in a

www.aacrjournals.org

MMR-independent manner and was observed in HCT116 and
HeLa-MSH2 cells. Replication arrest was signiﬁcantly alleviated by treatment with allopurinol indicating that it was
dependent on ROS and not simply a consequence of 6-TG
incorporation into DNA.
Defects in the FA pathway are particularly associated with
sensitivity to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. In a
previous publication (14) we reported that the ROS produced when DNA 6-TG is activated by UVA induce ICLs and
the chromosome aberrations that are typically associated
with these DNA lesions. To investigate whether 6-TG
induced ICLs independently of UVA activation, cells were
treated with 6-TG and the introduction of ICLs was analyzed
by the Comet assay. By comparing ICL formation in cells
treated with 6-TG in the presence or absence of allopurinol,
the contribution of ROS was also assessed. Cell lysates were
extensively digested with proteinase K before electrophoresis to remove any DNA–protein cross-links. Figure 6B shows
that 6-TG treatment reduced the comet tail moment produced by IR consistent with the formation of ICLs. ICL
induction was 6-TG dose dependent and was largely abolished when allopurinol was present during incubation with
6-TG. We conclude from these data that 6-TG incorporated
into DNA is a target for damage by ROS induced by the 6-TG
treatment itself and that oxidation of DNA 6-TG results in
the formation of ICLs.

Discussion
Our ﬁndings deﬁne a novel mechanism of 6-TG toxicity that
does not rely on MMR. Both pathways require incorporation of
6-TG into DNA and its post-incorporation modiﬁcation. One
important difference is that MMR intervention is triggered by
S-methylation of DNA 6-TG rather than the oxidation that is
implicated in MMR-independent cell killing. In both cases,
toxicity is counteracted by HR. The 2 pathways contribute to 6TG toxicity in MMR-proﬁcient cells. They are illustrated schematically in Fig. 7.
The FA pathway comprises 14 known FANC proteins that
coordinate the sensing and repair of DNA lesions, including
ICLs, that arrest replication (for review see ref. 17). Current
models of lesion processing invoke damage recognition and
recruitment of a ubiquitinated FANCD2:FANCI heterodimer to
sites of DNA damage by the FA "core" complex. Subsequent
nuclease-mediated incisions generate DNA double-strand
breaks that are then directed towards HR for resolution. The
FA pathway provides signiﬁcant protection against the lethal

effects of agents that cause replication stalling and FA-defective cells are very sensitive indicators of the presence of a
variety of DNA lesions that block advancing replication forks.
Some time ago, FANCG-defective hamster cells were reported
to be unusually sensitive to 6-TG (20). We conﬁrmed this
hypersensitivity in FANCA-deﬁcient MEFs and showed that
abrogation of the FA pathway also confers 6-TG sensitivity in
human cells. Importantly, this sensitivity is independent of
MMR indicating that it represents a novel mechanism of 6-TG
toxicity. Taken together with a previously noted hypersensitivity of HR-defective xrcc2 cells (14) and the recently reported
6-TG sensitivity of cells deﬁcient in the BRCA2 (also known as
FANCD1) or BRCA1 proteins (9), these ﬁndings ﬁrmly implicate the FA and HR pathways in preventing some of the
potentially lethal effects of 6-TG.
The observations reported here deﬁne 2 properties of 6-TG
that are necessary and sufﬁcient for MMR-independent cytotoxicity. The ﬁrst is its ability to increase intracellular ROS
by depleting antioxidant levels. This is probably a general
property of thiopurines. Consistent with our observations,

Figure 7. Mismatch repair-independent and repair-dependent pathways
of 6-TG cytotoxicity. Purine salvage by HPRT (1) leads to the
incorporation of 6-TG into DNA. DNA 6-TG is a substrate for damage (2)
by methylation or by ROS generated from 6-TG–mediated depletion of
cellular antioxidants. DNA 6-TG oxidation causes DNA replicationblocking lesions, including ICLs (3). These are lethal unless correctly
processed by the FA and HR DNA repair pathways (4). Base pairs
containing methylated DNA 6-TG are recognized by MMR, which
processes them into potentially lethal DNA lesions (5). Survival may be
increased by HR processing of DNA breaks resulting from the
intervention of MMR.

both 6-MP and azathioprine have been shown to deplete
reduced GSH in cultured human cells (23). ROS scavenging
abrogated both 6-TG-mediated replication inhibition and FA
pathway activation. The second essential property for toxicity
is the provision, in the form of DNA 6-TG, of a DNA target for
damage by ROS. Our ﬁndings indicate that the FA and HR
pathways process the potentially lethal oxidized DNA 6-TG
lesions that are generated by these reactions.
HR is also implicated in reversing MMR-dependent 6-TG
toxicity (9). In that case, by analogy to MMR involvement in
methylating agent toxicity (24), HR processing lies downstream of MMR-induced DNA breakage and replication fork
disruption most likely after incision at me6-TG:T mismatches
(8, 25). TGN are good substrates for incorporation into DNA
(26) and unmodiﬁed DNA 6-TG is not a replication block in
vitro (27). The strict requirement for both 6-TG and ROS
indicates that replication disruption in the MMR-independent
pathway is caused by oxidized DNA 6-TG lesions.
The complete absence of detectable toxicity in L-N cells is
eloquent testimony to the requirement for DNA substitution by
6-TG in both MMR-dependent and MMR-independent killing.
The oxidation potential of 6-TG is lower than that of canonical
DNA bases (28) and the well-documented oxidation of DNA 6TG to lesions that inhibit replication is consistent with involvement of the FA and HR pathways. The extreme vulnerability of

www.aacrjournals.org

FA cells to crosslinking drugs reﬂects their inability to process
ICLs correctly (17). UVA activation of DNA 6-TG produces ROS
that contribute to the formation of ICLs (14). The ﬁnding that
ROS-dependent DNA cross-linking occurs even in unirradiated
cells treated with 6-TG is surprising but is, however, consistent
with our previous observations of 6-TG-induced chromosome
aberrations. FA cells are hypersensitive to the induction of
chromosomal aberrations, breaks and radials, by UVA activated DNA 6-TG (14). Importantly, that study also revealed that 6TG induced the same spectrum of aberrations in unirradiated
cells. This pattern of chromosomal damage—generally associated with ICLs—is consistent with ICL formation by UVAdependent and UVA-independent mechanisms. In our experiments, 6-TG-induced ICLs were detected by the comet assay
and inferred from FANCD2 activation. These are both extremely sensitive indicators of DNA damage and probably reﬂect
relatively rare DNA lesions. It is also important to note that the
FA pathway is activated as a general response to stalled
replication and its function seems to be to direct processing
of replication-related DNA breaks away from the alternative
nonhomologous end joining pathway (29). It is likely that other
DNA 6-TG oxidation products such as GSO2, GSO3, or DNAprotein crosslinks also engage the FA pathway in 6-TG treated
cells.
Our experimental ﬁndings have implications for the clinical
use of thiopurines. Azathioprine and 6-MP are widely used to
treat leukemia and, increasingly, inﬂammatory bowel disease.
6-TG has been less frequently prescribed. Its limited use seems
to stem from its liver toxicity (30) although this seems somewhat controversial (discussed in ref. 31). 6-TG is now considered a viable alternative for inﬂammatory bowel disease
patients who fail to respond to azathioprine or 6-MP (32),
however. Indeed, in view of its more direct metabolism to TGN,
appropriate doses of 6-TG may offer a more predictable and
generally better treatment option than 6-MP or azathioprine.
The effectiveness of thiopurines is thought to reﬂect the ratio
between 2 principal metabolites, the TGNs and methylmercaptopurine (MMP) ribonucleotide. TGNs, the precursors of
DNA 6-TG, are regarded as the pharmacologically active
metabolites whereas the therapeutically inactive TPMTderived MMP contributes to the dose-limiting hepatotoxicity
(30). Direct conversion of 6-TG to TGN avoids the generation of
6-MMP and would therefore seem to be therapeutically advantageous. Indeed, 6-TG is particularly efﬁcacious in a subgroup
of patients for whom 6-MP or azathioprine treatment is
associated with subtherapeutic TGN, high MMP levels and
severe hepatotoxicity.
The effectiveness of azathioprine or 6-MP is improved by
coadministration of the XO inhibitor allopurinol (33). By
preventing the catabolism of a signiﬁcant fraction of these
drugs to inactive thiouric acid, XO inhibition increases the
availability of thiopurines for conversion to TGN. When combined with an appropriately reduced thiopurine dose, allopurinol permits the attainment of therapeutic TGN levels. This is
accompanied by a surprising and dramatic reduction in the
levels of methylated intermediates (33), which may be a reason
for the less severe adverse side effects of combined treatment.
Coadministration of allopurinol also alleviates some of the side

effects of 6-TG treatment. Unlike 6-MP, 6-TG is not a substrate
for XO and it can be administered with allopurinol without
dose reduction. In our experiments, allopurinol protected cells
against 6-TG toxicity by acting as a ROS scavenger and preventing DNA 6-TG oxidation. It is possible that these scavenging properties contribute to ameliorating toxic side effects in
patients and that some of the beneﬁcial effects of allopurinol in
combination with azathioprine and 6-MP may also stem from
its antioxidant properties.
In summary, we show that the cytotoxicity of 6-TG partly
reﬂects its accumulation in DNA where it serves as a target for
the intracellular ROS that are present at increased levels
because 6-TG also depletes antioxidant defences. The cytotoxic
effects of oxidized DNA 6-TG are independent of MMR and
reﬂect the formation of DNA lesions, including ICLs that
require processing by the FA and HR DNA repair pathways.
These properties of 6-TG suggest that it may be particularly
efﬁcient in the treatment of tumors with inactive BRCA1 or
BRCA2 (9) that are defective in these pathways. Our ﬁndings
also provide support, and a mechanistic rationale, for the

possible clinical effectiveness of combined 6-TG and allopurinol in certain patient groups.
