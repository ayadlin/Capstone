Abstract
The rapid proliferation of cancer cells mandates a high
protein turnover. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is intimately involved in protein processing. An accumulation of
unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER leads to a cascade of
transcriptional and translational events collectively called the
unfolded protein response (UPR). Protein disulfide isomerase
(PDI) is one of the most abundant ER proteins and maintains
a sentinel function in organizing accurate protein folding.
Treatment of cells with O 2-[2,4-dinitro-5-(N-methyl-N-4carboxyphenylamino)phenyl]1-(N,N-dimethylamino)diazen1-ium-1,2-diolate (PABA/NO) resulted in a dose-dependent
increase in intracellular nitric oxide that caused S-glutathionylation of various proteins. Within 4 h, PABA/NO activated
the UPR and led to translational attenuation as measured by
the phosphorylation and activation of the ER transmembrane
kinase, pancreatic ER kinase, and its downstream effector
eukaryotic initiation factor 2 in human leukemia (HL60) and
ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3). Cleavage of the transcription
factor X-box protein 1 and transcriptional activation of the ER
resident proteins BiP, PDI, GRP94, and ERO1 (5- to 10-fold
induction) also occurred. Immunoprecipitation of PDI showed
that whereas nitrosylation was undetectable, PABA/NO treatment caused S-glutathionylation of PDI. Mass spectroscopy
analysis showed that single cysteine residues within each of
the catalytic sites of PDI had a mass increase [+305.3 Da]
consistent with S-glutathionylation. Circular dichroism confirmed that S-glutathionylation of PDI results in alterations in
the A-helix content of PDI and is concurrent with inhibition of
its isomerase activity. Thus, it appears that S-glutathionylation of PDI is an upstream signaling event in the UPR and may
be linked with the cytotoxic potential of PABA/NO. [Cancer Res
2009;69(19):7626–34]

Introduction
Protein S-glutathionylation is increasingly recognized as an
important mechanism underlying redox regulation of signaling
pathways with downstream effect on numerous cell functions
(1, 2). Cysteine residues localized in a basic environment (vicinal to
Lys, Arg, or His) can have low pK a values, making them targets for

the addition of glutathione (GSH), that is, can be S-glutathionylated. This modification adds f305 Da and introduces a net
negative charge to the protein (as a consequence of the addition of
Glu). Critical in ascribing any regulatory function to this process is
the reversibility of S-glutathionylation by small-molecule proteins
such as glutaredoxin and sulfiredoxin (3–5). Our recent studies
suggest that glutathione S-transferase k is involved in mediating
the forward reaction of this cycle (6). Glutaredoxin is reportedly
involved in both forward and reverse steps (7). Protein disulfide
isomerase (PDI) is a CXXC motif–containing protein implicated
(albeit in a minor role) in deglutathionylation (8). PDI is a 57-kDa
member of the thioredoxin superfamily organized into five
domains (a, b, b¶, a¶, and c) with a COOH-terminal KDEL sequence
that targets it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER; ref. 9), where it is
involved in protein folding through disulfide bond formation and
isomerization. PDI contains two active sites in the a and a¶
domains, each having two conserved cysteine residues within the
motif CGHC that cycle between oxidized (disulfide) and reduced
(dithiol) states (10). PDI has enzymatic functions that facilitate
correct folding of proteins in the ER, for example, isomerase
activity that catalyzes the rearrangement of incorrectly formed
disulfide bonds and oxidase activity that introduces disulfides into
proteins. PDI can also participate in multimeric protein clusters as
a subunit of prolyl-4-hydroxylase and microsomal triglyceride
transfer protein. In addition, cell surface PDI can be involved in
cellular entry antigen processing (11), complexes with integrin
receptor in regulating cell adhesion (12), glioma cell invasion (13),
attachment and infectivity of Chlamydia (14), promotion of
disulfide bond rearrangements in HIV-1 envelope protein that
accompanies viral entry (15), and may even be a determinant of
drug resistance in malignant B lymphocytes (16).
O 2-[2,4-dinitro-5-(N-methyl-N-4-carboxyphenylamino)phenyl]1(N,N-dimethylamino)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (PABA/NO) is among
a series of prodrugs that incorporate diazeniumdiolate anions that
release nitric oxide (NO) in a kinetically favorable manner resulting
in nitrosative stress in cells (17, 18). Although NO has significantly
broad biological consequences in mammalian cells, we have been
interested in its capacity to induce S-glutathionylation of proteins.
Moreover, PABA/NO has antitumor potential both in vitro and in
mice (19), suggesting that there is value in developing this agent as
a chemotherapeutic. As such, there is a need to understand how its
pharmacologic effects may confer cytotoxicity.
Many anticancer drugs have electrophilic centers that can cause
direct and indirect oxidative or nitrosative stress. These agents
tend to have relatively nonspecific intracellular targets that when
affected result in apoptotic cell death. Recently, a new consensus is
emerging that the ER may be a common target for unrelated
electrophilic species (1). Dysregulation of ER homeostasis may

Protein Disulfide Isomerase S-Glutathionylation

cause a disruption of protein folding with the consequence that
misfolded proteins may accumulate in the ER lumen and trigger
activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Drug-induced
disruption of the components of the various steps that constitute
this pathway may play a pivotal role in inducing cell death,
particularly in tumor cells. As a consequence, there is a need to
clarify those molecular events that may link drug effects with
aberrations in the UPR and produce cytotoxicity.
Stress emanating from the ER results in the accumulation of
unfolded or misfolded proteins such that hydrophobic amino acid
side chains are exposed on the protein’s surface. This ‘‘misfolding’’
can result in a protein that does not maintain native interactions
or, alternatively, forms insoluble aggregates. Protein folding in the
ER is a crucial process and multiple signaling pathways have
evolved to ensure quality control. The UPR leads to a cascade of
transcriptional and translational events that include three
mechanisms: transcriptional activation of UPR-induced proteins
(including PDI and other chaperones), translational attenuation to
decrease the flux of nascent polypeptides imported, and ERassociated degradation of terminally misfolded proteins via
translocation to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation. The
ER membrane contains three signal-transducing proteins that
modulate the UPR: pancreatic ER kinase (PERK), activating
transcription factor, and inositol requirement 1 (IRE1). Each is
negatively regulated during homeostasis by a glucose-regulated
protein 78/BiP through protein-protein interactions. An accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins results in the dissociation
of BiP and activation of the membrane proteins. PERK activates an
immediate response to ER stress that results in a transient attenuation of mRNA translation through phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF2. PERK is associated with activation of
two transcription factors, activating transcription factor 4 and
NF-E2–related factor, which regulate downstream UPR genes and
antioxidant cellular defense pathways. IRE1 is a site-specific endonuclease that cleaves a small intron in the mRNA of X-box protein
1 (XBP-1), a bZIP transcription factor, leading to mRNA stabilization. Both IRE1 and activating transcription factor 6 mediate
the UPR through regulation of gene products with ER and
antioxidant stress response elements.
When the UPR is unable to counterbalance the protein folding
capacity, apoptotic pathways are activated (20). UPR-induced
apoptosis involves activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)
and dissociation of the TRAF2-apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1
complex and transcriptional activation of the gene for C/EBP
homologous protein (CHOP). IRE1 and activating transcription
factor 6 bind to the promoter of the apoptotic protein, CHOP.
CHOP is a 29-kDa protein that was also described as growth
arrest– and DNA damage–inducible gene 153. CHOP can be
phosphorylated and activated on Ser79 and Ser82 by the p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase family and leads to cell cycle
arrest (21). Overexpression of CHOP leads to Bax translocation
from the cytosol to the mitochondria. IRE1 has also been shown to
be activated itself by proapoptotic Bcl-2 members, Bax and Bak,
through protein-protein interactions in the cytoplasmic domain
(22). Bax and Bak have been localized in the mitochondria and
ER membrane where they are proposed to contribute to membrane
permeability (23).
Using a broad-spectrum proteomic approach, we have shown
previously that PDI is S-glutathionylated when HL60 cells are
exposed to PABA/NO (24). In the present study, we examine the
specific susceptible molecular targets within PDI and how they

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Reduced GSH, oxidized GSH, and the MTT reagent were
purchased from Sigma. 3-Amino-4-aminomethyl-2,7-difluorofluorescein
diacetate was purchased from Invitrogen. Thapsigargin was purchased
from Calbiochem. PABA/NO was a gift from Dr. Larry Keefer (Chemistry
Section, Laboratory of Comparative Carcinogenesis, National Cancer

phospho-specific PERK, and eIF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and antiJNK1/2, BiP, CHOP, and LC3 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen).
Cell lines and cell culture. The human ovarian (SKOV3) and leukemia
(HL60) cancer cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection and grown as recommended by the supplier. Cells were
maintained in RPMI (HL60) or McCoy’s (SKOV3) containing 10% FCS,
100 Ag/mL streptomycin, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 2 mmol/L

were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific
binding was reduced by incubating the membrane in blocking buffer
[20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 Amol/L
protease inhibitors, 5 mmol/L NaF, and 1 mmol/L Na3VO4] containing 10%
nonfat dried milk for 1 h. Membranes were incubated with the indicated
antibody (blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat dried milk) at stated
dilutions overnight at 4jC, washed three times with PBS for 15 min, and
incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase for 1 h. The membranes were washed three times
and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents
(Bio-Rad). The blots were scanned with a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc system
and visualized with a transilluminator. The images were stored in a TIFF
format. The relative intensity of bands was evaluated using Quantity
One software (version 4.5.2; Bio-Rad) and plotted as arbitrary units in
relation to actin.
Immunoprecipitation of PDI. SKOV3 cells were treated with 0 or
25 Amol/L PABA/NO for 4 h. Cell lysates (500 Ag) from control and treated
cells were precleared with protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) in the presence or absence of nonspecific IgG. PDI was
precipitated with the anti-PDI antibody (1:100) at 4jC overnight. Before
SDS-PAGE, the samples were heated to f95jC for 10 min in nonreducing
sample loading buffer.
In vitro S-glutathionylation of PDI. Recombinant human PDI in the
expression vector pET-28a was provided by Dr. Lana Lee (University of
Windsor) and expressed using the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3)
as described previously (25). PDI (2 mg/mL; >95% homogeneous) in
20 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was incubated for 1 h at room
temperature as follows: (a) control, (b) 25 Amol/L PABA/NO and 1 mmol/L
GSH, (c) 25 Amol/L PABA/NO, and (d) 1 mmol/L GSH. Excess PABA/NO
and GSH were eliminated through Biospin-6 size exclusion micro-spin
columns (Bio-Rad) with 20 mmol/L PBS. Nitrosylation and S-glutathionylation were detected by immunoblot. Control and drug-treated samples
were evaluated by mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, and fluorescence
scanning.

Identification of the target cysteine modifications of PDI. PDI from
control and drug-treated cells were separated by SDS-PAGE under
nonreducing conditions. Protein bands of interest were excised and subject
to LysC digestion. The peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry at the
Proteomics Core Facility of the Medical University of South Carolina. The
digested fragments were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography and 20 AL of the digested sample were injected with a Famous
autosampler (LC Packings) onto a 75 Am Microtech Scientific C18 RP
column. The peptides were eluted during a 30 min gradient from 2% to 70%
AcN with 0.2% formic acid using a 180 nL/min flow rate with an Ultimate
pump (LC Packings). The eluted peptides were detected on a Finnigan LTQ
linear ion trap mass spectrometer operated in data-dependent acquisition
mode with dynamic exclusion enabled. Protein identification was done
using software from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
protein database.
Spectroscopic analysis of PDI in vitro . The effect of PDI
S-glutathionylation on enzyme secondary structure was examined by
circular dichroism where measurements were carried out on a 202 AVIV
Associates using a semi-micro quartz rectangular 1  10  40 mm cuvette.
Native and S-glutathionylated PDI samples were maintained at 22jC using
a Pelletier element. Spectra were recorded while scanning in the far-UV
region (190-260 nm), with bandwidth of 1.0 nm, step size of 1.0 nm,
integration time of 30 s, and with three repeats. The output of the circular
dichroism spectrometer was recalculated according to the protein
concentration, amino acid content, and cuvette thickness into molecular
ellipticity units (degrees/cm2/dmol). Protein tryptophan fluorescence was
recorded on a F 2500 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi) using 10  10  40 mm
quartz cuvette, excitation and emission slits were 2.5 and 5.0 nm,
respectively. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm to minimize an effect
of protein tyrosines and phenylalanines. Background spectra were
subtracted from final emission of the protein.
NO measurement. Cells (5.0  105/mL) were incubated with 5 Amol/L
3-amino-4-aminomethyl-2,7-difluorofluorescein diacetate for 1 h in complete
medium at 37jC. The labeled cells were washed three times with PBS. The
dynamics of intracellular NO changes were measured using a Modulus

72 h with the MTT assay (A). Cells were labeled with
5 Amol/L 3-amino-4-aminomethyl-2,7-difluorofluorescein
diacetate to detect NO. NO generation was assessed
following 0 to 50 Amol/L PABA/NO treatment (B ). At
various time points, cells were harvested and analyzed by
immunoblot for S-glutathionylation (C). SKOV3 cells were
treated with 25 Amol/L PABA/NO for 4 h. PDI was
immunoprecipitated from 500 Ag lysate and separated
under nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE (D ). Specific
antibodies were used to detect S-glutathionylation of PDI
and, subsequently, the membrane was stripped and probed
for PDI. Mean F SD for three independent experiments.

Protein Disulfide Isomerase S-Glutathionylation

Figure 2. Active site cysteines in hPDI are targets for S -glutathionylation. hPDI was treated with 1 mmol/L GSH and/or 25 Amol/L PABA/NO for 1 h. S-glutathionylation
or nitrosylation of PDI was detected by immunoblot (A). To identify specific cysteine residues that are targets for S-glutathionylation, control and PABA/NO-treated
hPDI were digested with LysC under nonreducing conditions and analyzed by tandem mass spectroscopy. Two fragments corresponding to the active sites
(43-57 and 387-401) were detected in the treated samples (B and C, respectively). Each result was consistent with a single S-glutathionylated modification [+305.6]
with a probability of 8.7e-002 and 7.4e-002, respectively.

Microplate Multimode Reader (Turner BioSystems) with a ‘‘Blue’’ optical kit
(excision = 490 nm, emission = 510-570 nm) and standard kinetics mode. The
measurements were done at room temperature in 96-well Fluotrac
200 black microplates (VWR, Greiner Bio-One North America). The starting
point for the kinetic experiments began f2 min after the addition of PABA/
NO (e.g., the time necessary for additions of drug to all wells). All fluorescent
measurements were corrected using the following controls: fluorescence of
unlabeled cells, fluorescence changes in labeled cells without any addition of
PABA/NO, and the effect of addition of solvents on the cellular fluorescence
without probes.
PDI activity assay. PDI was incubated with various concentrations of
PABA/NO (0-100 Amol/L) and 1 mmol/L GSH for 30 min at 37jC. The
activity of PDI was monitored using the turbidimetric assay of insulin
disulfide reduction. Briefly, 0.25 Amol/L purified human PDI was added
to a solution of insulin (0-250 Amol/L) and GSH (500 Amol/L) in a
0.1 mol/L K2HPO4 containing 2 mmol/L EDTA (pH 7.0). The increase in
turbidity was monitored (k = 630) at 30 s intervals for 30 min. Three
independent experiments were conducted. Mean F SE was computed for
each group.
Cytotoxicity assays. Ten thousand cells were seeded in 96-well plates in
50 AL medium. Increasing drug concentrations were added to a final
volume of 100 AL and maintained in drug for 72 h. Following drug exposure,
cell viability was assayed by the MTT conversion assay. Each drug
concentration was represented in quadruplicate and three independent
experiments were conducted. Mean F SE was computed for each group.

RNA isolation and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR.
Total RNA was isolated and DNase I treated using the RNeasy mini kit
according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA was prepared
using either the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) or the RT2 First Strand
Kit (SABiosciences) according to the protocols of the manufacturers. All
quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR were done using the MyiQ
system (Bio-Rad) and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) or SYBR Green/
fluorescein PCR Master Mix (SABiosciences) according to the protocols of
the manufacturers. Actin mRNA levels were used to normalize differences in
cDNA levels and the data are expressed using the DDCt method (26).
Primers were designed using Primer3 software (27) and primer sequences
are listed in Table 1. All reactions were done in triplicate and data were
analyzed using the 2 DDCT method (26). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase and actin was used as a gene control to normalize
differences in cDNA between groups.
Statistical analysis. Mean, SD, and SE for at least three experiments
were calculated for each treatment group. These data were analyzed for
statistically significant differences between groups with Student’s t test
using SigmaStat 3.5 (Systat Software). Differences were considered
statistically significant if P < 0.05.

antitumor activity in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant
ovarian cancer xenografts (19). The following studies were designed
to validate that PDI is a pharmacodynamic marker of PABA/NO
in ovarian cancer cells. Figure 1 shows that PABA/NO treatment
leads to dose-dependent cytotoxicity and NO generation in human
ovarian cancer cells, SKOV3 (Fig. 1A and B). We have reported
previously that the toxic effects of PABA/NO treatment are
attributed to S-glutathionylation of cellular proteins in HL60 cells,
among which is PDI (24). Consistent with these findings, PABA/NO
treatment caused S-glutathionylation of several proteins in SKOV3
cells (Fig. 1C). One of the high molecular weight proteins had
a mobility characteristic of PDI. Immunoprecipitation of PDI
followed by immunoblot for S-glutathionylated moiety confirmed
that PDI is S-glutathionylated (Fig. 1D). Lane 4 shows that PABA/
NO treatment enhanced the extent of PDI S-glutathionylation in a
manner that was reversible by the reducing agent DTT (lane 5).
The bottom panel shows that PDI itself was present only in lanes
1, 4, and 5.
Active site cysteines in hPDI are targets for S-glutathionylation. Using human full-length PDI, we confirmed via immunoblot
and mass spectroscopy that drug treatment leads to S-glutathionylation of cysteine residues. PDI (1 Amol/L) was incubated in
50 mmol/L NaPO4 (pH 7.4) at 37jC for 30 min with 100 Amol/L
PABA/NO or 10 mmol/L GSH or both. The samples were separated

by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The gels were
transferred overnight to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and
immunoblotted with anti-S-glutathionylation (Fig. 2A), anti-Snitrosylation, and anti-PDI antibodies. Nitrosylation was not
detected by Western blot. Native and S-glutathionylated PDI was
subjected to LysC digestion, the resultant fragments analyzed
under nonreducing conditions by tandem mass spectroscopy.
Within two distinct peptides (residues 43-57 and 387-401), a mass
increase of 305.6 was consistent with the S-glutathionylation of one
cysteine residue in each fragment (see Fig. 2B, asterisks).
S-glutathionylation of the active site cysteines on PDI alters
structure. We evaluated the effects of S-glutathionylation of PDI
on its secondary structure. The circular dichroism spectrum
(200-240 nm) of S-glutathionylated PDI was quite similar to native
protein (Fig. 3A) but consistent with a small decrease in the a-helix
content (206-220 nm) of the protein. Based on the crystal structure
of PDI, the sulfhydryls of cysteine residues 61 and 64 are proximal
to a tryptophan at position 60. Consistent with the known
quenching effect of a disulfide bond on adjacent tryptophanyl
fluorescence, the intrinsic tryptophanyl fluorescence of PDI was
measured (6). Our data showed a substantial PDI tryptophanyl
fluorescence decrease corresponding with S-glutathionylation
(Fig. 3B). These results indicate the dynamic nature of Sglutathionylation resulting in spatial disulfide/sulfhydryl equilibria.

Figure 3. S -glutathionylation of the active site cysteines on PDI alters protein structure. Spectroscopic analysis of native (red ) and PABA/NO + GSH–treated (green )
PDI in vitro was done using circular dichroism (A ) and tryptophanyl fluorescence (B ) of purified protein. The enzymatic activity of PDI was assessed using the
insulin turbidity assay (C ). Mean F SD for three independent experiments. According to the published crystal structure (39), the relative positions of the PDI C61 and 64
and W60 are depicted using RasMol 2.7.4.2 (http://rasmol.org; D ).

Protein Disulfide Isomerase S-Glutathionylation

Figure 4. S -glutathionylation of PDI is concurrent with activation of the UPR in SKOV3 cells. Thapsigargin (TG ) was used as a positive control to induce ER
stress and activation of the UPR. SKOV3 cells were treated with 20 Amol/L PABA/NO or 0.45 Amol/L thapsigargin for 0 to 24 h. Translational attenuation through
activation of PERK and eIF2 was evaluated in SKOV3 cells following drug treatment (A ). Protein lysate (50 Ag) was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by
immunoblot for levels of JNK, PERK, and eIF2. The membranes were stripped and probed for total levels of phosphorylated proteins. Activation of XBP-1 was detected
by PCR (B). RNA was extracted at various time points and analyzed with primers specific to XPB-1. A 398-bp fragment corresponds to the cleaved and active
form of XBP-1. Transcriptional activation of ER stress proteins was evaluated with SYBR Green reverse transcription-PCR methods (C ). SKOV3 cells treated with
20 Amol/L PABA/NO for 0 h (white columns), 6 h (gray columns ), or 24 h (black columns ). The relative quantity was measured as the ratio of the mRNA expression of
the target gene to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the protein levels of UPR-inducible genes are also
elevated following treatment with PABA/NO for 0-24 h (D ). Mean F SD for three independent experiments.

Moreover, a hypsochromic shift of emission maximum f4 nm
after protein S-glutathionylation indicates some shielding of Trp38
from a polar environment through Cys61 and/or Cys64 S glutathionylation (Fig. 3D). The possible disulfide that may form
at positions Cys90 and Cys97 is too distal from the tryptophan
residue to have an effect. These fluorescent analyses confirm that
S-glutathionylation affects the tertiary structure of PDI.
PDI reductase activity was assessed by insulin turbidity assay
(Fig. 3C). Native and S-glutathionylated PDI were applied to Micro
Bio-Spin columns to remove excess PABA/NO and GSH. PDI
proteins (250 nmol/L) were then incubated at 25jC with 1 mg/mL
insulin in NaPO4 in the presence of 1 mmol/L DTT. The precipitation
of reduced insulin was recorded every 2 min for 30 min at 650 nm.
After subtracting the basal rate of DTT-mediated insulin reduction,
the specific activity of native PDI in this assay was 1,518 F 258 (units/
min/mgP). Moreover, the catalytic activity of PDI is diminished in a
dose-dependent manner following PABA/NO treatment (Fig. 3C).
We propose that S-glutathionylation of PDI may be an upstream
event that is sufficient to contribute to the accumulation of unfolded
proteins and thereby trigger activation of the UPR.
S-glutathionylation of PDI is concurrent with activation of

stress and is mediated by phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2. By
treating SKOV3 cells with either PABA/NO or the UPR-inducing
agent, thapsigargin, at approximate IC50 concentrations (Fig. 4A),
it was possible to show that cytotoxic effects were temporally
accompanied by increases in phosphorylation of JNK, PERK, and
eIF2. Total protein levels of these products were unaffected
(Fig. 4B).
Paradoxically, transcriptional activation and translation of UPR
genes also occurs under ER stress. We monitored drug-induced
changes in transcript levels for several UPR genes at 0, 4, and
24 h following PABA/NO treatment. Cleavage of the transcription
factor XBP-1 was detected as early as 2 h following treatment
(Fig. 4B). Using real-time PCR, it was possible to quantitate a timedependent transcriptional activation of the ER resident proteins
BiP, GRP94, ERO1, and PDI, all of which showed between 5- and
10-fold induction (Fig. 4D). PABA/NO is cytotoxic to cancer cells
and we show a 9-fold induction of the proapoptotic transcription
factor, CHOP, which is also a UPR effector. Using immunoblot
analysis, we confirm that the protein levels for BiP and CHOP are
up-regulated (Fig. 4D).
In the preclinical characterization of PABA/NO, we discovered
that PDI is S-glutathionylated in HL60 cells following treatment

(24). These studies showed that PDI is a molecular target of PABA/
NO in SKOV3 cells and suggest that the mechanism of cell death is
attributed to activation of the UPR. These studies were extended to
HL60 cells and it is illustrated in Fig. 5 how PABA/NO treatment
can lead to nitrosative stress and cell death through induction of
the UPR.

Discussion
In designing these investigations, we have sought to link the
mechanism of cytotoxic action of a NO-releasing drug with the
induction of an ER stress response in target cells. At the same time,
drug-induced S-glutathionylation of PDI regulates its activity and
facilitates upstream regulation of the UPR. It seems plausible that
this post-translational modification of PDI may contribute to how
the ER detects stress and may determine whether a cell survives a
treatment that can produce a UPR event. Activation of the UPR is
mediated by at least three ER proximal sensors (IRE1, PERK, and
activating transcription factor 6) and our data show that PABA/NO
affects the expression of each of these. The coordination of the PDI
and downstream signaling events provides an integration point for
the functional determination of cell survival pathways. Several
recent reports have suggested that cancer pathology and the

response of cancer cells to drugs may be dependent on an
integration of ER stress response pathways (28). It is also worth
noting that PDI can have important chaperone functions that
depend on formal protein-protein interactions (29, 30).
When S-glutathionylation and PERK activation by PABA/NO
were compared to a known ER stress–inducing agent thapsigargin,
some significant similarities were observed. The mechanism of
action of thapsigargin is attributed to inhibition of the Ca2+ pump
protein located in ER membranes (SERCA; ref. 31). As such, it is
intriguing that thapsigargin induces S-glutathionylation with
kinetics similar to PABA/NO, notably with proteins in the 50 to
60 kDa range. This is consistent with the hypothesis that Sglutathionylation is an important signaling event associated with
stress emanating from the ER. A significant pool of PDI in SKOV3
cells undergoes S-glutathionylation in a time-dependent manner
following PABA/NO. Immunoblots detected three bands in the
PABA/NO-treated sample that correspond to monomeric PDI,
suggesting that multiple sites on the protein may be modified.
Interestingly, larger molecular weight species were also present,
suggesting that multimers might undergo redox modification.
The cytotoxic effect of PABA/NO-induced nitrosative stress has
been linked to JNK activation that leads to apoptosis (24). Our
present studies provide further insight into the mechanism and

Figure 5. Mechanism of PABA/NO-induced antitumor activity is attributed to activation of the UPR. The mechanistic studies were extended to HL60 cells in
which S-glutathionylation of PDI was originally identified following PABA/NO treatment. HL60 cells were treated with 0 to 50 Amol/L PABA/NO for 1 h. Translational
attenuation through activation of PERK was evaluated in HL60 cells following drug treatment (A). Protein lysate (50 Ag) was separated by SDS-PAGE and
analyzed by immunoblot for levels of JNK and PERK. The membranes were stripped and probed for total levels of phosphorylated proteins. Activation of XBP-1 was
detected by PCR (B). RNA was extracted at various time points and analyzed with primers specific to XPB-1. A 398-bp fragment corresponds to the cleaved and active

cells were treated with 25 Amol/L PABA/NO for 4 to 6 h (white columns ) or 24 h (gray columns ). The relative quantity was measured as the ratio of the mRNA expression
of the target gene to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Mean F SD for three independent experiments.

suggest that nitrosative stress elicits cell damage through ER stress.
To show mechanism, two of the three signaling events that initiate
the UPR, PERK, and IRE1 activation were up-regulated by PABA/
NO. An accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins leads to
the dissociation of BiP from PERK and IRE, allowing phosphorylation and activation of both proteins. The kinase activity is
dependent on conformational changes that occur when PERK is
phosphorylated and this occurred in a dose- and time-dependent
manner in SKOV3 cells following PABA/NO. Validation that PABA/
NO activates UPR responsive genes was provided by the 2- to 10fold increased expression of PDI, ERO1, BiP, and CHOP. Collectively,
these data suggest that S-glutathionylation of PDI diminishes the
folding capacity within the ER and mediates the UPR.
The link between S-glutathionylation of PDI and the UPR
presents an important mechanistic connection with respect to
cellular cytotoxic effects of PABA/NO and thapsigargin. We
envision the following model for how PABA/NO may induce
cytotoxic effects. Activation of PABA/NO occurs intracellularly in
the presence of GST and GSH (17, 32). This releases NO that
through nitrosative stress causes direct or indirect S-glutathionylation of several protein clusters, among which are those involved
in protein folding (1). By comparing PABA/NO with thapsigargin, it
is possible to draw parallels between the mechanisms of action of
the two drugs. Recently, we have shown that thapsigargin and
PABA/NO share the capacity to alter calcium flux from the ER to
cytosol.3 Thapsigargin has been categorized as an inhibitor of
SERCA, but there is no obvious metabolite of the drug that is likely
to produce either oxidative or nitrosative stress (33). Thus, it is
unexpected that thapsigargin causes S-glutathionylation and has
implied a cause-effect relationship of this post-translational
modification and calcium homeostasis, a subject of another study.3
Implications for PDI function should also consider that our
present study has not drawn distinction between the cellular
localization of PDI. Although the majority of PDI is located in the
ER, there are reports that PDI may also regulate the cell surface

redox environment (16, 34). This can be important in cell adhesion,
antigen processing, or viral entry (11, 12, 15). S-glutathionylation of
cell surface proteins by oxidized GSH alters both extracellular and
intracellular redox homeostasis in HL60 cells (35).
PDI is involved in both rapid metabolism of GSNO and
intracellular NO delivery, and during this process, PDI is itself
altered by thiol modification (36). Following treatment of cells with
diethylamine-NO, PDI was shown to be subject to nitrosylation
(37). Although we did not detect nitrosylation of PDI following
PABA/NO (data not shown), such a modification may readily be
subject to rapid conversion to S-glutathionylation (2, 38). The
functional implication of this post-translational modification is
that PDI has a reduced activity for the period that the cysteine
residue is S-glutathionylated. Our previous results estimate that the
half-life of the S-glutathionylation modification is f3 h (6). In
cataloguing existing literature, at least six clusters of proteins seem
to be subject to S-glutathionylation, cytoskeletal/structural, energy
metabolism/glycolysis, calcium homeostasis, signaling kinases and
phosphatases, redox homeostasis, and protein folding (1). Similar
to phosphorylation, cysteine modification is critical to normal
cellular signaling and its dysregulation is linked with multiple
diseases. From this perspective, there may well be a general link
between diseases associated with ER stress and the accumulation
of S-glutathionylated PDI. Finally, it is worth noting that drugs such
as Velcade essentially have an indirect effect on the UPR through
interference with the proteasomal machinery. It appears that
PABA/NO has a mechanism of action that induces a UPR cell death
more directly through PDI as an intermediary.
