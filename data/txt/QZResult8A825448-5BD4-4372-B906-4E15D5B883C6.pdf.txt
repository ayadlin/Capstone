SDF-1 is widely expressed by stromal cells from various tissues
including dendritic cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts,
and vascular smooth muscle cells from the skin; osteoblasts
and endothelial cells from the bone marrow; and astrocytes and
neurons from the brain (3–6). Two SDF-1 isoforms, SDF-1a and
SDF-1h, have been identified in human and mouse. These two
isoforms arise from a single gene through alternative splicing and
the only difference is that SDF-1h contains a four amino acid
COOH-terminal extension (7). SDF-1 is highly conserved between
species. Human and mouse SDF-1a and SDF-1h are 99% and 97%
identical in amino acid sequences, respectively. No differences have
been reported between SDF-1a– and SDF-1h–regulated expression
and biological activity.
SDF-1 binds primarily to CXCR4 cytokine receptor and the SDF1-CXCR4 axis has a prominent role in regulating leukocyte and
hematopoietic progenitor cell functions, including the survival and
migration of hematopoietic progenitor cells to the bone during
embryonic development (8, 9). Recent research has shown that SDF1-CXCR4 axis also plays an important role in tumorigenesis by
regulating tumor cell proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion
(1, 10, 11). It has been shown that CXCR4 protein expression
correlates with tumor grade in human prostate cancer and SDF-1
mRNA expression is elevated in metastatic prostate tumors
although not in benign or localized tumors (12). Particular attention
has been paid to the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis in prostate cancer bone
metastasis, as SDF-1 is able to significantly increase the adhesion of
human prostate cancer cells to the osteoblast and endothelial cell
culture models, and to enhance their migration and invasion (13).
In vivo, administration of a CXCR4-neutralizing antibody or
blocking peptides significantly reduces the ability of PC-3 prostate
cancer cells to metastasize and grow in bone (14). SDF-1 is also
important in angiogenesis where it promotes vascular endothelial
cell migration and induces capillary tube formation (15, 16).
Previously, we and other groups have shown that the aberrant
expression of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) is linked to
prostate cancer progression and bone metastasis, and that BMP
can promote prostate cancer cell survival and invasion, and
stimulate angiogenesis (17–21). Thus far, however, these studies
have been limited to the tumor cells only. In this study, we focus on
the BMP signaling in the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and
their heterotypic interactions in prostate cancer where BMP is
found to be highly up-regulated and seem to facilitate both
paracrine and autocrine circuits.

Abstract
We examined the effect of the extracellular bone morphogenetic
protein (BMP) 2 and 7, which are up-regulated in the prostate
adenocarcinomas of the conditional Pten deletion mouse
model, on primary cultures of cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAF) derived from these tumors. In the CAF, we show that
BMP2 or BMP7, but not transforming growth factor B-1, can
strikingly stimulate secretion of stromal cell–derived factor-1
(SDF-1), also known as CXCL12. The CAF cells express type I and
type II BMP receptors as well as the receptor for SDF-1, CXCR4.
SDF-1 activation is associated with BMP-induced Smad
phosphorylation, and the stimulatory effect is blocked by BMP
antagonist, noggin. The findings that BMP treatment can
increase SDF-1 pre-mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner
and actinomycin D treatment can abolish stimulatory effect of
BMP suggest a transcriptional modulation of SDF-1 by BMP
signaling. Using a human microvascular endothelial cell line, we
show that SDF-1 present in the conditioned medium from the
stimulated CAF can significantly induce tube formation, an
effect relating to angiogenic function. Furthermore, we found
that BMP2 can also protect the CAF from serum starvation–
induced apoptosis independent of SDF-1, implying that BMP
may induce other factors to sustain the survival of these cells. In
short, this report establishes a novel BMP-SDF-1 axis in the
prostate tumor along with a new prosurvival effect of BMP that
when considered together with our previously described
oncogenic properties of BMP indicate a circuitry for heterotypic cell interactions potentially critical in prostate cancer.

Introduction
The stromal microenvironment of the tumor plays a critical role
in support of the growth, survival, and dissemination of tumor
cells. The majority of the stromal cells are fibroblasts and among
them, the myofibroblasts or so-called ‘‘activated fibroblasts’’, which
are characterized by expression of a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA),
are most prominent in prostate cancer. The enriched population of
myofibroblasts in the tumor stroma is associated with the
production of increased levels of stromal cell–derived factor-1
(SDF-1), also called CXCL12 ligand (1, 2).

crossed scalpels (size 11 blades), and cultured in Bfs medium: DMEM
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% Nu serum
(BD Biosciences), 0.5 Ag/mL R1881 (PerkinElmer), 5 Ag/mL insulin (SigmaAldrich), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. After 1 week of culturing, cells
that migrated from the tissue clumps were trypsinized, transferred to
new culture dishes, and allowed for surface attachment for a short
period of time, varying from 1 to 10 min. Cells that were not attached
were then removed, and the dishes with firmly attached cells were
washed with PBS to further eliminate loosely attached cells. Based on the
observations of the cell morphology, the cultures that contained most
homogenous fibroblastic-like cells were expanded and used for experiments within 12 passages. The dorsolateral lobes of the prostate from
littermate controls were similarly processed to obtain normal prostate
fibroblast cultures.
Cell culture, recombinant proteins, SDF-1 neutralizing antibody,
and conditioned medium. CAF cells were cultured in the same Bfs
medium that was used to isolate them. Human microvascular endothelial
cells (HMVEC) were cultured in Medium 131 with Microvascular Growth
Supplement (Cascade Biologics) in 0.1% gelatin coated dishes. The human
recombinant proteins BMP2, BMP7, transforming growth factor (TGFh-1),
and noggin, and SDF-1 neutralizing antibody were purchased from R&D
Systems, Inc. The recombinant murine SDF-1a was purchased from
PeproTech, Inc. To collect the conditioned medium from the CAF, cells
were washed with PBS and incubated with the serum-free medium (SFM)
with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 Ag/mL insulin, and 0.5 Ag/mL R1881 for
24 h. The debris in the conditioned medium was separated by centrifuge,
and the aliquots of the supernatant fluid were stored at 80jC. The SFM
with the same supplements indicated above was used to serum starve the
CAF for the apoptosis experiments.
Immunofluorescence analysis. Cells cultured on 4-well chamber slide
(Nalge Nunc International) were washed with PBS twice, fixed with 4%
(weight/volume) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and permeabilized by
0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After washing with PBS twice, slides
were incubated in the TBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween and 3% normal
horse serum for 30 min. Monoclonal SMA-Cy3 antibody (Sigma) was added
at 1:200 dilution and allowed to bind at room temperature for 1.5 h. The
chamber slides were then washed in PBS thrice and mounted with
Vectorshield mounting medium containing nucleus staining solution 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories).
Western blot analysis. The tissue lysates and whole cell lysates were
prepared as described before (18). The antibodies used in the Western blot
experiments were goat anti-BMP2/4 (R&D Systems), rabbit anti-Smad5,
anti–phospho-Smad1,5,8, (Cell Signaling Technology), and goat anti-actin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
SDF-1 ELISA. The mouse SDF-1a concentration in the conditioned
medium from CAF was measured using a commercially available SDF-1
ELISA kit (R&D Systems). Because the number of the CAF cells and the
volume of SFM used for conditioned medium preparation varied in different
experiments, the ELISA results were further normalized by cell number
and presented as total amount of SDF-1a secretion per one million cells
(ng/million cells).
RNA preparation, semiquantitative, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen,
Inc.) or RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) after the protocols recommended by the
manufacturers. DNaseI (Ambion) was used to remove contaminants of
genomic DNA in the RNA samples. The RNA (2 Ag) was reverse transcribed
by using iScript DNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The synthesized cDNA was
subjected to PCR with the primers described in Supplementary Table S1.
The optimal cycle that can reflect the amount of original template was
determined and used in the semiquantitative PCR experiment at the
indicated annealing temperatures. Real-time PCR was carried out using
13 AL of 2 Brilliant SYBER Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene) with 1 AL
of cDNA in a total volume of 25 AL. The PCR conditions were as follows:
1 cycle of 95jC for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95jC for 30 s, 55jC for 1 min, and
72jC for 30 s; and 1 cycle of 95jC for 1 min and 55jC for 30 s. Reactions
were carried out with the Stratagene Mx3000P PCR machine, and the cycle
thresholds were determined with its accompanying software. Actin was

Supplementary Table S1.
Tube formation assay. Forty-eight–well plates were coated with 150 AL
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at 4jC and were incubated for 1 h at 37jC.
HMVEC cells (2  104) were added to the Matrigel-coated wells in 0.5 mL
SFM or conditioned medium from fibroblasts. After 24-h incubation, cells
were photographed under phase-contrast microscopy, and tubes were
counted at low-power magnification from five randomly chosen fields in
each well.
Apoptosis analysis (TUNEL). Cellular apoptosis was assayed using
APO-BRDU kit (Phoenix Flow Systems) following the instructions of the
manufacturer.
Statistical analysis. All experiments were performed in triplicates
and repeated at least twice. Statistical comparisons were made using an
unpaired, two-tailed t test.

Results
BMP2 is overexpressed in prostate adenocarcinomas.
Previously, we reported that BMP7 was strikingly up-regulated
with the growth of primary prostate tumors (18) in the conditional
Pten deletion (cPten / ) mouse model (23, 24). Here, we analyzed
the expression levels of two other BMPs, BMP2 and BMP4. We
extracted proteins from the anterior lobe, the ventral lobe, and the
dorsolateral lobes of tumor-harboring cPten / or cPten / L mice
and the corresponding normal tissues of their littermate controls.
In preliminary experiments, we found that the presence of the

reporter gene in cPten / L model did not significantly affect any of
the expression analyses we described for the cPten / model.
Considering this matter, we interchangeably used tissues from
either of these models for this work. Western blot analysis of
the dorsolateral lobes with antibodies that recognize both BMP2
and BMP4 revealed progressive overexpression of these proteins
in parallel to tumor development. As shown in Fig. 1A, at age
1.5 months, when tumors are yet to form (18), there was no
significant difference in the BMP2/4 protein level between the
prostates from the experimental mice and their littermate controls.
At age 3 months, BMP2/4 protein levels increased in tumors
as illustrated for dorsolateral lobes. In a 12.5-month-old mouse,
BMP2/4 protein expression was strongly up-regulated in tumors of
all lobes (Fig. 1B). Because the antibody used in the Western blot
was not able to distinguish between BMP2 and BMP4 protein, we
used semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to
detect the specific transcripts for BMP2 and BMP4 individually in
a 13-month-old mouse model and its littermate control. As shown

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (1). January 1, 2008

in Fig. 1C, BMP2 mRNA expression was consistently higher in every
lobe of the tumor model compared with the normal prostate. No
increase in BMP4 mRNA levels was detected in any of the tumorbearing lobes of the prostate. Together, the results support a
pattern of BMP2 overexpression, similar to that of BMP7, with the
growth of primary prostate tumors.
CAF cells express A-SMA, BMPs, and BMP receptors. We
derived two primary cultures of CAF, CAF-1 and CAF-2, from
tumors of cPten / L mice of two different ages, 4.5 and 7.5 months,
respectively. The cultured CAF cells, exhibited fibroblastic cell
morphology, and most cells were strongly positive for a-SMA
(Fig. 2A). In addition to the expression of BMP members (BMP2,
BMP4, and BMP7), the expression of the three type I and three type
II receptors was also examined by RT-PCR assays. A representative
pattern of expression is shown in Fig. 2B. In both CAF-1 and CAF-2,
mRNAs corresponding to BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7, and all six BMP
receptors, were readily detected, although CAF-1 and CAF-2 varied
in the expression levels of specific receptors. Although CAF-1

(Fig. 3B, a and C, a). Although CAF-1 and CAF-2 seemed to
respond similarly to BMP treatment, the basal level of SDF-1 was,
however, determined to be 3- to 4-fold higher in CAF-1 compared
with CAF-2. To test whether SDF-1 can also be up-regulated in the
fibroblasts from normal prostate tissue, we tested a primary
fibroblast culture from a normal control mouse and observed a
very similar effect of BMP2 and BMP7 on these fibroblasts. The
SDF-1 secretion is increased by BMP2 or BMP7 treatment in
a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by phosphorylation
of Smad that could also be blocked by noggin (Supplementary
Fig. S1).
BMP2 transcriptionally up-regulates SDF-1 expression.
When we measured the levels of SDF-1 mRNA by quantitative
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), BMP2 treatment for 24 h was found to increase
the level by 1.9-fold in CAF-1 and 1.7-fold in CAF-2 (Fig. 4A). This
indicated a transcriptional regulation. However, an alternative
could be that the increased SDF-1 expression was due to mRNA
stabilization. We addressed this issue by measuring the effect of
BMP2 on SDF-1 pre-mRNA, which provides a close estimate of the
transcription rate of the gene. Therefore, the SDF-1 transcripts
were analyzed by qRT-PCR using primers that spanned an exonintron boundary of this gene. DNaseI treatment and appropriate

displayed a relatively higher level of BMPRIB, CAF-2 expressed
more ActRI and ActRIIB.
BMP2 and BMP7 stimulate SDF-1 secretion in CAF. We
examined the RNA expression of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in the CAF and
in HMVEC and found that all of these cell cultures express SDF-1
and CXCR4 constitutively (Fig. 2C). To test a possible relationship
between BMP and SDF-1 signaling in CAF, we measured SDF-1
secretion in our two CAF cultures after treatment with BMP2 or
BMP7 or other extracellular signaling molecules that may
potentially influence SDF-1 secretion, namely TGFh-1, interleukin
8 (IL-8), and osteopontin. BMP2 or BMP7 was found to strongly upregulate SDF-1a secretion in both CAF-1 and CAF-2 in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3A, a and C, a). The effect of BMP2 was
stronger, with 6-fold up-regulation observed at the 200 ng/mL
concentration (Fig. 3A, a). This was paralleled by phosphorylation
of BMP-Smads, where BMP2 again was more effective than BMP7
(Fig. 3A, b and C, b). TGFh-1 (Fig. 3A, a and C, a), IL-8, and
osteopontin (data not shown), which were tested at various
concentrations, could not significantly affect SDF-1a secretion. In
the presence of noggin, which abolished the ability of BMP2 and
BMP7 to cause Smad phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, b and C, b), the
stimulatory effect on SDF-1 secretion was also similarly nullified

Figure 3. BMP2 and BMP7 stimulate SDF-1 secretion and induce Smad phosphorylation in CAF-1 and CAF-2 cells. A (a), B (a), and C (a), conditioned medium
(CM) from CAF-1 or CAF-2 cells with different 24 h treatments as indicated in the charts were assayed for SDF-1a concentration by ELISA, and the level of
secreted SDF-1a, represented as nanogram per one million cells (ng/million cells ), was compared among different groups by normalization with conditioned medium
volume and cell number. A (b), B (b ) and C (b), the same CAF cells that are used for ELISA were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis to detect Smad
phosphorylation and the expression of Smad5. Analysis of actin was used as a loading control.

Figure 4. BMP2 transcriptionally up-regulates SDF-1 in CAF. A, RNA was extracted from CAF-1 and CAF-2 cells with or without BMP2 (100 ng/mL) treatment for
24 h and used to determine the SDF-1a RNA quantity by real-time RT-PCR. The quantity for control cells was adjusted to 1 and the results are shown by the fold
increase. Bottom, the results of semiquantitative RT-PCR for SDF-1a and actin by using the same cDNA. B, the pre-mRNA levels of SDF-1a were measured by
real-time RT-PCR using the RNA samples from CAF-1 treated with BMP2 (100 ng/mL) at the indicated time periods. Primers were designed to span an exon-intron
boundary, and absence of genomic DNA was confirmed by eliminating the reverse transcription step (data not shown). C, conditioned medium from CAF-1 cells in
the absence or presence of BMP2 (100 ng/mL), with or without pretreatment of actinomycin D (10 Ag/mL), was measured for SDF-1a level by ELISA. D, RNA
extracted from the same CAF-1 cells with the different treatments indicated above was subjected to semiquantitative RT-PCR for SDF-1a.

that actinomycin D was able to suppress BMP2 stimulated SDF-1
secretion (data not shown).
Increased SDF-1 secretion by BMP2 treatment enhances the
ability of CAF to stimulate microvascular tube formation.
Using a human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line, HMVEC,
recombinant murine SDF-1a, and BMP2 were examined for their
ability to stimulate HMVEC tube formation. As shown in Fig. 5A
and B, BMP2 could not stimulate more tube formation than the
SFM, whereas low concentrations (1 to 10 ng/mL) of SDF-1
increased the tube formation in a dose-dependent manner. At high
concentrations (100 ng/mL), SDF-1 however displayed a rather
inhibitory effect (data not shown). It would be important to note
that the concentrations of SDF-1 (as determined by ELISA) in the
conditioned medium from CAF in our experiments ranged from
0.2 to 0.6 ng/mL at basal level and to 1 to 6 ng/mL after BMP2/7
stimulation (data not shown). We then used the conditioned
medium from the variously treated CAF-1 for the HMVEC tube
formation assay. The conditioned medium from CAF-1 with
BMP2 treatment, which contained a higher level of SDF-1,
stimulated relatively more tube formation (45%) than the
conditioned medium from nontreated or noggin-treated CAF-1

controls without reverse transcription verified that genomic DNA
was excluded from our RNA preparations (data not shown). As
shown in Fig. 4B, BMP2 treatment increased the SDF-1 pre-mRNA
level in a time-dependent manner, with a 2-fold stimulation
observed after a short treatment for a period of 2 h. These results
suggest direct effect of BMP2 on SDF-1 expression at the level of
transcription. To further confirm that BMP2 regulates SDF-1 at
the transcriptional level, we measured the effects of BMP-2 on
SDF-1 mRNA and SDF-1 secretion in transcriptionally arrested
CAF-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, pretreatment with the
transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D abolished the stimulatory
effect of BMP2 on SDF-1 secretion. Consistent with the ELISA
results, the SDF-1 RNA level did not change significantly when the
cells were pretreated with actinomycin D before exposure to
BMP2 as shown in Fig. 4D. Interestingly, actinomycin D itself
seemed to slightly stimulate SDF-1 expression (Fig. 4C and D), an
effect that could possibly be due to suppression of one or more
negative regulatory mechanisms of SDF-1 expression. In fibroblasts from normal prostate tissue, it was also shown that the
SDF-1 mRNA level was increased by BMP2 and BMP7 by both
semiquantitative PCR and qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2), and

BMP Promotes SDF-1/CXCL12 Expression and Secretion

Discussion

cells, and this stimulatory effect was reversed when CAF cells were
cotreated with BMP2 and noggin (Fig. 5A and C). The stimulatory
effect was also abolished, as shown in Fig. 5D, when the HMVEC
cells were cotreated with SDF-1–neutralizing antibody (20 Ag/mL).
BMP2 protects CAF from serum starvation induced apoptosis. To examine whether BMP might confer survival advantage
to CAF, we serum starved the CAF-1 and CAF-2 with or without
BMP2 treatment and measured the apoptotic rate in these cells. As
shown in Fig. 6A, serum starvation for 4 days induced 15%
apoptosis in CAF-1, whereas BMP2 treatment significantly reduced
this apoptotic rate to only 6%. At days beyond 4 days, most of these
cells underwent apoptosis irrespective of the presence or absence
of the added BMP in the medium. In CAF-2, which was found to
be more resistant to serum starvation compared with CAF-1, the
experiment could be extended to 6 days. The reasons for
differences in the sensitivity for apoptosis between CAF-1 and
CAF-2 are not clear at this time. Under serum starvation for 6 days,
the apoptosis was 80% for CAF-2 but reduced to only 29% in the
presence of BMP2 (Fig. 6B). This protective effect of BMP2 is
independent of SDF-1 up-regulation, as SDF-1 alone could not
significantly enhance the survival of CAF cells (Fig. 6A and B).

Previously, we showed that BMP7 expression increases progressively with the growth of the prostate adenocarcinoma in the
conditional Pten deletion mouse model (18). Here, we show that
BMP2 expression is also increased during the progression of
prostate tumor in this model. This new observation is consistent
with the findings that describe elevated expression of BMP2 in
human prostate cancer (20, 25–27). The most exciting finding in
this report, however, is the observation that BMP can strongly
induce in CAF the expression of SDF-1, a chemokine that functions
as both chemoattractant for cell migration and mitogen for cell
proliferation and survival. By using two different CAF primary
cultures, CAF-1 and CAF-2 isolated from 4.5- and 7.5-month-old
animals, respectively, we have shown a similar response. Both CAF
cultures exhibit myofibroblastic traits and a major difference
between them is the basal level of SDF-1, which is higher in CAF-1
relative to CAF-2. They also differ in their sensitivity to serum
starvation, CAF-1 being more susceptible to apoptosis. In contrast
to BMP, we show that TGFh-1, representing a major member
of the superfamily to which BMP belongs, practically lacks the
ability to induce SDF-1 in CAF. CAF cells are critical in prostate

SDF-1 (1 or 10 ng/mL). The tube numbers were counted from five randomly selected fields at high power (20), and the number shown in the chart represents
the sum of these counts. C, HMVEC cells were treated with conditioned medium from control CAF-1 cells and CAF-1 cells that were treated with 1 Ag/mL noggin,

were treated with conditioned medium from control CAF-1 or CAF-1 cells treated with 100 ng/mL BMP2 for 24 h, in the absence or presence of 20 Ag/mL SDF-1
neutralizing antibody.

increase in extracellular BMP is likely to positively induce SDF-1
expression in the prostate tissue microenvironment.
We show that supernatants from CAF cells treated with BMP2
correlated with increased in vitro capillary tube formation by
human microvascular endothelial cells. Many previous studies have
shown that SDF-1 induces tube-like structure formation in
endothelial cells such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells,
murine brain capillary endothelial cells, and endothelial progenitor
cells (6, 15, 35). In our study, the increased level of SDF-1 secreted
by CAF after BMP exposure is indeed shown to be a major
contributory factor in tube formation, implying that BMP signaling
in the fibroblasts may be an important factor for angiogenesis in
the prostate tumor.
Another function of BMP observed in this study is that BMP2
can protect CAF cells from serum starvation–induced apoptosis.
This effect seems to be practically independent of SDF-1. We have
reported previously that BMP7 is able to inhibit serum starvation–
induced apoptosis in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and, more
remarkably, in its bone metastatic variant C4-2B, through upregulation of survivin expression and c-Jun-NH2-kinase activation
(19). Further investigation will be needed to determine if a similar
or a different mechanism is involved in this protection of the CAF
cells by BMP.
One important issue arising from this study is whether BMP
functions in a paracrine or an autocrine fashion or both for the
induction of SDF-1. Based on our results that were reported
previously and studies from other groups, it is clear that prostate
cancer cells do generally express high levels of BMP. Although we
show that CAF cells also express detectable levels of BMP, we did
not observe any significant inhibition of the basal level of SDF-1 by
noggin treatment, indicating that the endogenous functional levels
of BMP in CAF may not be sufficient to enhance SDF-1 expression.
However, noggin treatment was found to induce increased
apoptosis in CAF under the serum starvation condition (data not
shown), which may suggest a possible protective mechanism of the
endogenous BMP in relation to antiapoptosis signaling in the CAF.
As CXCR4 is found to be present in the CAF, whether SDF-1 may
also have autocrine effects on CAF is still another point that
remains to be defined.
Taken together, the evidence for strong induction of SDF-1 by
BMP in CAF along with the demonstrated expression of BMPR and
CXCR4 in both prostate cancer and CAF cells, and expression of
CXCR4 in endothelial cells seem to indicate potentially important
heterotypic cell-cell interactions driven by both autocrine and
paracrine mechanisms in prostate cancer. This newly identified
BMP-SDF-1 axis as well as the SDF-1–independent protective
function of BMP on the CAF that we describe highlight novel BMP
signaling variables in the prostate cancer microenvironment. These
results further underscore the contention that the intervention of
BMP signaling activity may lead to a potential therapeutic
treatment for prostate cancer.

Figure 6. Assessment of the apoptotic percentage in CAF cells with BMP2
or SDF-1 treatment after serum starvation. A and B, CAF-1 and CAF-2 cells
were cultured in SFM in the absence or presence of 100 ng/mL BMP2, or in the
presence of 10 ng/mL SDF-1 for 4 d and 6 d, respectively, and collected for
TUNEL assay. N.S., not statistically significant.

tumorigenesis, a point that was originally shown by the potency of
human prostatic CAF, but not normal prostatic fibroblasts, to
induce tumor formation from initiated, nontumorigenic human
prostatic epithelial cells (28, 29). Of the multiple mechanisms by
which CAF may support tumor growth, secretion of elevated levels
of proteases, growth regulators, and extracellular matrix proteins
have been implicated to date (30). In human breast and prostate
cancer, several studies have shown that SDF-1 is overexpressed
in CAF and can contribute to both tumor growth and angiogenesis
(1, 30, 31).
The pivotal role of SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in tumor progression and
metastasis has been widely recognized. However, the current
knowledge on how SDF-1 may be regulated, especially in tumors, is
very limited. It is reported that IL-17 induces the production of
SDF-1, as well as the expression of SDF-1 mRNA, in cultured
Rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner (32).
Interestingly, in a murine bone stromal cell line, SDF-1 expression
is found to be down-regulated by TGFh-1, both at the mRNA level
and at the protein level (33). In dermal wound healing, it has also
been shown that IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor–a inhibit the
expression of SDF-1 by human fibroblasts in vitro (34). The SDF-1
induction by BMPs that we describe in our study is not confined to
only CAF. A similar effect is observed in the fibroblasts derived
from normal prostate tissues. These results imply that regardless of
the origin of the prostate fibroblasts, and despite the variation of
the constitutive levels of SDF-1 in these cell populations, any
