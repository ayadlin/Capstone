ABSTRACT
TGF-β pathway is generally associated with the processes of metastasis,
angiogenesis and EMT in cancer. Very little is known, however, about the role of TGF-β
in cancer drug resistance. In this work, we show a specific activation of the TGF-β
pathway in consequence of chemotherapeutic treatment in in vivo and in vitro models
of colorectal carcinoma. 5-Fluorouracil (5FU) was able to stimulate the activation of
SMAD3 and the transcription of specific genes such as ACVRL1, FN1 and TGFB1. On
the other hand, the specific inhibition of TGF-βRI was able to repress the 5FU-induced
genes transcription and to restore the sensitivity of chemoresistant cells to the toxic
action of the drug, by decreasing the expression of BCL2L1 and ID1 genes. The role
of the TGF-β molecule in the chemoresistant colon carcinoma cells’ response to 5FU
was further demonstrated by conditioned medium (CM) experiments: CM from 5FUtreated chemoresistant cells was able to protect chemosensitive cells against the toxic
action of 5FU. In conclusion, these findings showed the pivotal role of TGF-β pathway
in colon cancer mechanisms of drug resistance suggesting new possible approaches
in diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer patients.

receptor SMADs (SMAD2/3) form a complex with
co-SMAD (such as SMAD4) and translocate to the
nucleus  to  regulate transcription of target genes [5, 6].
In the non-canonical SMAD-independent pathways,
TGF-β can activate or suppress a plethora of alternative
signaling pathways, such as p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT,
Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) and Rho GTPases.
SMAD and non-SMAD pathways activation is strongly
dependent on physiological or pathological cellular subset
in which TGF-β exerts its action [7–9].
In epithelial tumors, TGF-β paradoxical role is due
to the loss of the anti-proliferative effects of the TGF-β
pathway in the first stages of tumor development and the
consequent exacerbation of tumor-promoting effects [10].

INTRODUCTION
TGF-β is known to have paradoxical roles in
carcinogenesis and cancer development: in the early
stages of oncogenesis TGF-β pathway activation is
generally associated with oncosuppression [1], whereas in
the more advanced stages of tumor development TGF-β
promotes metastasis, angiogenesis, immunosuppression
and Epithelial to Mesenchymal transition (EMT) [2, 3].
TGF-β ligands bind type 2 TGF-β receptor (TGFβR2), which dimerize with an other TGF-βR2; the
such formed dimer forms then a tetramer with a type 1
TGF-β receptor (TGF-βR1) dimer, causing TGF-βR1
phosphorylation [4]. TGF-βRI activates downstream
pathways via the canonical SMAD pathway, in which

For example, ATF3-mediated ID1 repression is one of
the tumor suppressor arms of TGF-β signaling [11], but
in patient-derived metastatic breast cancer cells TGF-β
causes an aberrant increase of ID1 expression promoting
lung metastasis [12].
In colon cancer models, TGF-β pathway hyper
activation can eventually lead to the expression of
PAI-1, and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in cancer
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) [13] by creating a positive
loop of TGF-β production and a tumor promoting
microenvironment. TGF-β is also associated with tumor
progression, neo-angiogenesis and lymph-node metastases
in colorectal cancer, and it has been suggested as a possible
biomarker for cancer progression and aggressiveness [14].
In addition, TGF-β is able to recruit macrophages to
the tumor site and direct their response to a M2 phenotype,
which is immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenetic [15,
16]. In spite of plenty of literature about the pivotal role
of TGF-β in colon cancer, very little is known about
the molecular mechanisms activated by TGF-β in colon
cancer drug resistance. Recent findings showed that
MED12 (Mediator Complex Subunit 12) expression
was able to modulate TGF-β signaling and to influence
chemotherapeutic response in colorectal cancer cells
[17, 18]. However, this kind of induced resistance is
generically associated to the acquisition of a mesenchymal
phenotype by cancer cells, and not to a TGF-β-specific
response to chemotherapeutic administration.
The aim of this work was to deepen the molecular
aspects of TGF-β signaling in a colorectal cancer model
of reversion of chemoresistance [19]. The translational

relevance of this study is highlighted by the finding
that TGF-β pathway was up-regulated in consequence
of chemotherapeutic administration, and that specific
inhibition of TGF-β signaling was able to restore drug
sensitivity in colorectal cancer cells, in in vivo and in vitro
models.

RESULTS
5-fluorouracil treatment causes an activation of
TGF-β pathway in vivo
We previously set up a xenograft model of colon
cancer chemoresistance reversion and in this model we
reported that Lithium (LiCl), which inhibits glycogen
synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), administration was able
to re-sensitize chemoresistant colon cancer cells to
5-Fluorouracil (5FU) chemotherapeutic action [19].
Since it has been reported a relationship between GSK3
and TGF-β pathways in tumor progression of different
carcinomas [20, 21] and it has been demonstrated the
relationship between chemoresistance and TGF-β in colon
cancer [17], we investigated how the TGF-β pathway
could contribute to the chemoresistance/chemoreversion
phenomenon in our model. Immunohistochemistry
analysis of TGF-βRI on xenografted tumor masses
indicated that LiCl administration caused a significant
downregulation of this receptor kinase expression,
independently from 5FU administration in chemoresistant
xenograft tumors (Figure 1A and 1B, upper panels).
On the other hand, 5FU treatment increased nuclear

translocation of SMAD3 as compared to control group,
whereas LiCl was able to restore basal levels of nuclear
SMAD3 (Figure 1A and 1B, middle panels). As a result,
LiCl-mediated TGF-βRI downregulation was able to
contrast the 5FU-induced SMAD3 increased activation.
Since the TGF-β pathway has a pro-angiogenic effect
[22–24], we analyzed the microvasculature of the
xenografted tumors in our model and we found a dramatic
increase of tumor vascularization in consequence of
5FU administration (75mg/kg/d twice a week), whereas
the combination of LiCl (160 mg/kg/d) and 5FU was
able to significantly decrease the vasculature density,
restoring the basal value (Figure 1A and 1B, bottom
panels). Noteworthy, no significant changes in TGF-βRI
expression, in SMAD3 localization nor in vascularization,
were observed in chemosensitive HCT116 xenograft
tumor sections (Supplementary Figure S1), suggesting
that the observed molecular events are selective for
chemoresistant tumors. Taken together, these findings
indicated that LiCl and 5FU exert opposite effects on
TGF-β signaling pathway and that such regulations are
exclusive for chemoresistant cells.

(Supplementary Figure S3A, S3B) nor in 3D-cultured
tumor cells (Supplementary Figure S3C). On the basis of
these results, we hypothesized an involvement of the TGFβRI in the chemoresistant cells response to 5FU. In order
to verify if the LiCl-mediated TGF-βRI downregulation
was an off-target effect or a specific molecular regulation
involved in chemoresistance, we inhibited the TGFβRI by using SB431542, a well-known inhibitor of
this serine/threonine kinase receptor [12, 25, 26].
Proliferation analysis showed that SB431542 treatment
was able to dramatically decrease Ki67 expression in
combination with 5FU, in HCT116p53KO cells (Figure 3).
Furthermore, cell death analysis by the Propidium Iodide
(PI) incorporation assay revealed that the co-treatment
with 5FU and SB431542 was able to significantly
increase the number of cells in sub G0/G1 cell cycle
phase (apoptotic or dead cells) not only in HCT116p53KO
but also in HT-29 cells, another chemoresistant colon
cancer cell line (Figure 4). Taken together these data
suggested that the TGF-βRI modulation is involved in the
chemoresistance/chemoreversion phenomenon.

5FU modulates TGF-β target genes expression in
chemoresistant colon carcinoma cells

TGF-βRI inhibition reduces proliferation
and increases cell death of chemoresistant
cancer cells

In order to better elucidate which TGF-β signaling
pathway molecules are possibly involved in the colon
cancer chemoresistance, we analyzed the expression levels
of 84 different genes known to be fundamental players
in TGF-β signaling. To this extent, HCT116p53KO
3D-cultured cells were treated with vehicle, 5FU, LiCl,
SB431542 or a combination of 5FU and LiCl or 5FU and
SB431542 and the corresponding RNA samples were
analyzed by quantitative RT2-PCR Profiler Array (Qiagen).
Expression array analysis revealed a strong up-regulation
of TGF-β target genes in consequence of 5FU treatment:
52 genes were found to be up-regulated, 10 didn’t
reveal any change and 12 genes were downregulated
(Supplementary Figure S4). Among the analyzed genes,
4 were selected for their significant modulation and
biological function and further validated (Table 1):
ACVRL1 (Activin A receptor type II-like 1), known
to be involved in angiogenesis and tumor growth; FN1
(Fibronectin-1), a master regulator of ECM remodeling
and cell-matrix adhesion; ID1 (Inhibitor of DNA binding
1), which promotes cells proliferation and migration;
BCL2L1 (BCL-2 like 1), encoding for a well known antiapoptotic protein. ACRVL1 and FN1 were found to be
significantly upregulated by 5FU administration, whereas
LiCl or SB431542 treatments inhibited such increased
gene transcription (Figure 5). On the other hand, ID1
and BCL2L1 did not show any significant change in
cells treated with 5FU alone, whereas LiCl or SB431542
co-treatments with 5FU strongly downregulated the
expression of these two genes (Figure 5). Consistently
with all previous data, LiCl and SB431542 had similar

In order to better characterize the molecular aspects
of TGF-β pathway regulation by 5FU and LiCl, we
established an in vitro 3D model of colon carcinoma cells.
The 3D model consisted of a gelled extracellular matrix
(ECM) bed, on which colorectal cancer cells were seeded
at low density; cells were then cultured in a gradient of
ECM and reduced serum condition (See Materials and
Methods). The aim of this model was to reproduce, as
much as possible, the tri-dimensional structure of an
epithelial tumor.
Consistently to our findings in the in vivo model,
immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis of 3D
cultured chemoresistant cells treated with 5FU, LiCl
or a combination thereof revealed a downregulation
of TGF-βRI exerted by LiCl (Figure 2A, 2C, 2E).
Moreover, it was observed a strong SMAD3 nuclear
translocation in consequence of 5FU treatment (Figure
2B and 2D) which was abolished when cells were cotreated with 5FU and LiCl. To further support these
findings, immunoblot analysis for pSer204-SMAD3 was
performed on HCT116p53KO cells. As shown in Figure
2F, 5FU administration caused a significant increase in
SMAD3 phosphorylation, which was abolished by LiCl
administration. No significant changes in SMAD3 nuclear
translocation or TGF-βRI expression were detected in
chemosensitive HCT116 cells (Supplementary Figure
S2). The downstream activation of SMAD3 did not
involve regulation of SMAD4, as expression levels of this
protein did not change in any treatment nor in xenograft

cells. Taken together, these results suggested that, in
chemoresistant colon carcinoma cells exposed to 5FU,
the chemotherapeutic agent stimulates proliferative
and pro-migratory signaling, whereas 5FU and LiCl or

SB431542 co-treatments were able to abolish the 5FUactivated pathway. Furthermore, the 5FU and LiCl or
SB431542 co-treatments were also able to inhibit the prosurvival signals in chemoresistant cells, thus re-sensitizing
HCT116p53KO cells to the chemotherapeutic action.

TGF-β1 exerts a protective action against
5-fluorouracil treatment

TGF-β1 on HCT116p53KO xenografted tumors, revealed
an increased protein expression in consequence of 5FU
administration. Once more, LiCl administration was able
to impair TGF-β1 increased levels (Figure 6B, 6C). This
finding led us to speculate a kind of autocrine signal
operated by chemoresistant cells in presence of 5FU.
We then investigated if TGF-β1 could be a protective
factor against 5FU toxicity. To this extent, we treated
chemosensitive colon carcinoma HCT116 cells with
TGF-β1 in combination with standard 5FU treatment
and cell proliferation and death were measured. HCT116
cells, treated with both TGF-β1 and 5FU, did not show
any decrease in Ki67 expression as compared to the 5FUtreated cells without TGF-β1 treatment (Figure 7A, 7B).

The observation of increased activation of SMAD3
and the strong modulation of TGF-β target genes in
consequence of 5FU treatment in chemoresistant colon
carcinoma cells, led us to hypothesize a possible role of
the TGF-β molecule in the cell response to 5FU. To verify
this hypothesis, we investigated the expression levels
of TGF-β1 in HCT116p53KO cells. Interestingly, we
found that TGF-β1 expression was significantly increased
by  5FU treatment and, oppositely, LiCl or SB431542
co-treatments with 5FU were able to restore basal levels
of TGF-β1 (Figure 6A). Moreover, IHC analysis for

These findings, consistently with previous observations,
suggested that TGF-β1 treatment was able to protect
chemosensitive cells against the action of 5FU. To
further support the hypothesis of an autocrine protective
loop of TGF-β1, we administered 5FU to HT-29 and
HCT116p53KO cells, and then we added such conditioned

medium to 5FU-treated chemosensitive cells. As shown
in Figure 8, the medium conditioned from chemoresistant
HT-29 or HCT116p53KO cells was able to protect
chemosensitive cells from the chemotherapeutic toxicity.

chemoresistant cells were simultaneously added to

reversion of this phenotype, we investigated, in an in
vitro model, the molecular events occurring in colon
carcinoma cells exposed to 5FU. To better recapitulate
the tumor tissue architecture and some microenvironment
features in vitro, we used an established 3D-model
[28, 29] mimicking a three-dimensional structure of a
tissue. In this model, the down-regulation of TGF-βRI in
LiCl-treated cells was confirmed (Figure 2A, 2C, 2E). The
5FU-induced SMAD3 nuclear translocation, as well as its
inhibition due to LiCl treatment, was observed through
immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses (Figure
2B, 2D, 2F). Since TGF-β pathway activation induces
Ser204-SMAD3 phosphorylation, in TGF-βRI-dependent
manner [30], we analyzed the p-Ser204-SMAD3 levels
in 3D-cultured cells and found an activation consistent
with the nuclear translocation of SMAD3 (Figure 2F).
Noteworthy, it has been reported that LiCl treatment was
able to inhibit pSer204-SMAD3 levels [30] and SMAD3/
SMAD4 transactivation via the cAMP– protein kinase
A (PKA), AKT–GSK3β, and CRE-dependent signaling
pathways [31]. No previous literature reports LiClmediated TGF-βRI downregulation. In order to exclude
a LiCl off-target effect on TGF-βRI, we specifically
inhibited TGF-βRI by using SB431542, a well-known
TGF-βRI inhibitor [12, 25, 26]. We observed that TGFβRI specific inhibition in combination with 5FU was able
to re-sensitize chemoresistant cells to chemotherapeutic
action, in terms of inhibition of proliferation (Figure 3)
and induction of cell death (Figure 4). These findings
excluded the possibility of an off-target effect of LiCl on
TGF-βRI, and confirmed the active involvement of the
TGF-β pathway in the phenomenon of chemoresistance.
Trying to unravel which molecules could be
involved in the TGF-β pathway modulation in colon
cancer chemoresistance, we performed a gene profiling
by analyzing 84 TGF-β target genes: chemoresistant
colon carcinoma cells that received 5FU showed an upregulation of 52 out of 84 genes analyzed (Supplementary
Figure S4). More interestingly, SB431542 and LiCl
treatments were both able to inhibit 5FU-induced TGF-β
target genes expression profiles. Among the analyzed
genes, four were selected on the basis of significance and
biological function and were further validated. ACRVL1,
a receptor known to have role in neo-angiogenesis [32,
33] and tumor cell proliferation [34, 35] was found to be
up-regulated by 5FU administration, while its expression
was reduced in cells co-treated with 5FU with LiCl or
SB431542 (Figure 5). 5FU alone also strongly induced
FN1, a protein involved in ECM reorganization and cell to
matrix adhesion processes [36, 37], but FN1 up-regulation
was abolished by the co-treatment of 5FU and LiCl or
5FU and SB431542 (Figure 5). The expression levels of
BCL2L1 (a gene encoding for anti-apoptotic proteins [38,
39]) were found to be consistent with cell death evaluated
by PI incorporation assay (Figure 4): as expected, in

chemosensitive cells, the protective effect of conditioned
medium was impaired, and chemosensitivity restored
(Figure 8).

DISCUSSION
The results presented in this work showed that
the TGF-β pathway has a pivotal role in colon cancer
models of chemoresistance. TGF-β is known to be a
main player in the processes of tumor development,
metastasis and angiogenesis [1–3, 14, 27]; the TGF-β
pathway has been recently associated to drug resistance
[17], but very little is known about TGF-β pathway
specific activation in the context of chemotherapeutic
administration in colon carcinoma. We recently reported
that LiCl, which inhibits GSK3, administration was
able to re-sensitize chemoresistant colon cancer cells
to 5FU chemotherapeutic action, in vitro and in vivo
[19] and we used this model of chemoresistance to
investigate a possible involvement of TGF-β pathway in
this phenomenon. We observed that LiCl administration
to xenografted tumors-bearing mice significantly
downregulated TGF-βRI expression in chemoresistant
tumors (Figure 1). A non-significant reduction was also
observed in 5FU treated tumors that was not confirmed by
any other findings and was probably due to the intrinsic
variability of the xenograft model. SMAD3 is one of the
main effectors downstream the TGF-βRI activation and the
immunohistochemistry analysis of this marker surprisingly
revealed that 5FU dramatically increased SMAD3 nuclear
translocation, suggesting an activation of the TGF-β
pathway (Figure 1). The treatment with LiCl abolished
this induction, preventing SMAD3 to enter the nucleus
even if the 5FU had been administered together with
LiCl (Figure 1), suggesting that the inhibition of GSK3
pathway could switch off the TGF-β pathway activation
induced by 5FU. Moreover, the LiCl-induced impairment
of SMAD3 nuclear translocation was consistent with TGFβRI downregulation observed in tumors from LiCl-treated
mice. As TGF-β is known to be a main player in the neoangiogenesis and vascular sprouting processes [22–24],
we investigated if the observed modulation of TGF-βRI
and SMAD3 molecules correlated with modifications in
the microvasculature of the xenografted tumors. Again,
consistently with a hypothesis of a specific modulation
of TGF-β pathway induced by 5FU and LiCl treatments,
we observed that the group of tumors that received
5FU showed increased vascularization as compared
to control group (Figure 1). Furthermore, the number
of microvessels was restored to basal levels by LiCl
administration. Noteworthy, no significant changes were
observed in chemosensitive tumors in SMAD3, TGF-βRI
or vasculature modulation (Supplementary Figure S1).

chemoresistant cells, 5FU treatment did not induce any
significant change in expression of an anti-apoptotic gene
(Figure 5). On the other hand, the expression of BCL2L1
was significantly reduced in cells co-treated with 5FU and
LiCl or SB432541 (Figure 5). Interestingly, the inhibition
of TGF-βRI (LiCl- or SB431542-mediated) in combination
with 5FU, was able to significantly repress the expression
of ID1 (Figure 5), which is a strong promoter of TGF-βmediated cell proliferation and migration [40–42].
Taken together, these findings suggested that the
activation of TGF-β pathway was specifically induced
by 5FU treatment in chemoresistant colon carcinoma
cells, and that the target genes modulated during this
phenomenon are involved in the regulation of surrounding
microenvironment as well as in cell mechanisms of death
and proliferation. In addition, the inhibition of TGF-β
pathway not only was able to counteract 5FU-induced
genes modulation, but it restored some of the mechanisms
generally lost in chemoresistant cells (BCL2L1 and ID1).
The increase in nuclear localization of SMAD3
in our in vivo and in vitro models of chemoresistance
together with the modulation of TGF-β target genes
only in chemoresistant, 5FU-treated, colon carcinoma
cells led us to hypothesize a possible role of the TGF-β
molecule in the response to 5FU. TGF-β1 was found
to be upregulated by chemotherapeutic treatment and
restored to basal levels by co-treatment of 5FU with LiCl
or SB431542 in HCT116p53KO cells in vitro and ex vivo
(Figure 6). This finding suggested a sort of autocrine loop:
the chemoresistant cells increase SMAD3 signaling, which
increases TGF-β1 expression, which in turn increases
SMAD3 signaling again. In fact, TGF-β1 is known to be
the main inducer of TGF-β1 itself [43, 44]. In our model,
the loop would be interrupted by TGF-βRI inhibition, as it
is the receptor which is up-stream of the whole signaling
pathway.
To support this hypothesis, we then investigated if
TGF-β1 could be a protective factor against 5FU toxicity
in chemosensitive colon carcinoma cells, HCT116. As
expected, we observed that TGF-β1 treatment was able
to protect HCT116 (chemosensitive) cells to the action
of 5FU (Figure 7); in order to further demonstrate that
the protection against 5FU is induced in chemoresistant
cells exposed to 5FU, we treated chemoresistant colon
carcinoma cell lines (HT-29 and HCT116p53KO) with
5FU and used such conditioned medium to protect
HCT116 chemosensitive cells from 5FU-induced toxicity.
Consistently, HCT116 showed an increased protection
against 5FU action when treated with chemoresistantcells-conditioned medium (Figure 8). Noteworthy, the
main genetic difference between chemosensitive HCT116
and chemoresistant HCT116p53KO cell lines is the
knocking out of TP53 gene in the latter, and this raises the
question on the possible role of p53 in the 5FU-induced
TGF-β pathway activation, which would need further
investigations.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated for the first
time that the 5-fluorouracil treatment activated the TGF-β
pathway in drug resistant colorectal carcinoma cells
in in vivo and in vitro models. The specific abrogation
of TGF-β pathway was able to restore sensitivity to
chemotherapeutic action by specifically modulating the
gene expression profile. The TGF-β pathway activation
of 5FU-stimulated chemoresistant cancer cells conferred
protection, by modulating surrounding microenvironment
as well as cell mechanisms of death and proliferation
genes, against 5FU toxicity.

as previously reported [19]. Briefly, HCT116p53KO
chemoresistant cells were subcutaneously injected into
the left flank of the mouse and HCT116 chemosensitive
cells were injected into the contralateral flank, when the
tumors reached the average volume of 100mm3, animals
were randomized and distributed in the 4 treatment groups.

After 21 days of treatment, animals were sacrificed and
xenografted tumors collected. Resected tumors were put in
formalin. Sections were then dehydrated, diafanized with
xylene, put in paraffin, sectioned with microtome and put
on slides. After deparaffinization, citrate based antigen
retrieval was performed. Blocking was performed using
Normal Horse Serum (ImmPRESS Reagent Kit, Vector
Labs). Slides were then incubated with specific primary
antibody diluted in PBS-Tween 0.1% for 1 hour in a humid
chamber, avoiding drying of specimens. Slides were then
incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary
antibody. For the detection of mouse microvasculature,
after deparaffinization, slides were blocked with CarboFree™ Blocking Solution (Vector Laboratories) and
incubated with Biotinylated GSL I –isolectin B4 (10
μg/ml, Vector Laboratories). VECTASTAIN® ABC
peroxidase was then applied to the specimens.
Processed slides were finally added with
3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector Laboratories) to
develop the chromogenic reaction, and counter-stained
with Hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories). Coverslips
were mounted after de-hydration of the sections, using
Permanent Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories).
Images were digitally acquired with ScanScope (Aperio)
and quantified using ImageScope software (Aperio). The
quantification was performed on the whole tumor section
excluding necrotic areas and using Positive Pixels Count
or Nuclear algorithm (Aperio), on the basis of the antigen
localization.

medium  containing 5-Fluorouracil (5FU, 200 μM) and
Lithium, SB431542 or TGF-β1 was added and maintained
for 72 hours. For conditioned medium experiments,
3D-cultured HT-29 and HCT116p53KO cells were treated
with vehicle or 5FU, and after 48h of conditioning,
chemoresistant cells conditioned medium was used to treat
3D-cultured HCT116 cells for 72h. SB431542, when used,
was added simultaneously to the conditioned medium.

Immunofluorescence
For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were seeded
in 8-well chamber slides (LabTek Chamber slides, Thermo
Fisher Scientific), cultured and treated as described
in the previous section. At the end of treatments cells
were fixed with 4% Formaldehyde and, for intracellular
antigens detection, permeabilized with Triton X-100
0.5% in PBS. Blocking with BSA 3% was performed
to prevent non-specific binding of the antibodies. Cells
were then incubated with primary antibody diluted in
BSA 3% for 1 hour and for 30 minutes with appropriate
secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted on slides
using ProLong Gold mounting medium with DAPI (Life
Technologies). Slides were imaged with a Zeiss Axioskope
2 microscope (Zeiss) equipped with fluorescence lamp and
filters and a high-resolution digital camera (C4742–95,
Hamamatsu Photonics). Single channel grey-scale images
were quantified using ImageJ Software [46]. Threshold
was fixed and applied to all images stained with the same
antibody. For nuclear antigens, images were processed
and threshold was fixed in order to measure only
nuclear staining signal. Obtained fluorescence intensity
measurements were normalized to DAPI fluorescence
signal. The images were then processed with Adobe
Photoshop CS6 software for color assignation to the
corresponding fluorescence signal.

Cell lines, 3D cell culture and treatments
HCT116 and HCT116p53KO colon carcinoma
cell lines were a kind gift of Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns
Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), HT-29 cells
were from American Type Culture Collection (LGC
Standards, Sesto San Giovanni, Italy). All cell lines were
authenticated by STR analysis at Promega. Upon arrival,
cells were expanded and frozen as a seed stocks of first or
second passage. All cells were passaged for a maximum
of 4 weeks, after which new seed stocks were thawed
for experimental use. HCT116, HCT116p53KO and HT29 cells were grown in McCoy’s 5A-Glutamax medium
with 10% FBS (Gibco, not Heat Inactivated), 100 U/ml
Penicillin and 100 μg/ml Streptomycin. All cells were
maintained in a 37°C incubator at 5% CO2.
For 3D culture, cells were seeded at a density
of 1*105/ml on a gelled bed of Extracellular Matrix
(Cultrex®, Trevigen) in McCoy’s 5A-Glutamax medium
supplemented with 4% FBS (Gibco), 100 U/ml Penicillin
and 100 μg/ml Streptomycin and 2% of Cultrex®, in
order to create an Extracellular Matrix (ECM) gradient,
modified from Debnath et al [45]. Three days after
seeding, cells were pre-treated with LiCl (10mM) or with
SB431542 (10μM) or TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). After 24 hours
of pre-treatment, old medium was discarded and fresh

Cell lysis, SDS-PAGE and western blotting
At the end of the treatments, cells were detached
from gelled ECM using CellSperse™ (Trevigen) solution.
Collected cells were lysed with a modified RIPA buffer:
TrisHCl 50mM, NaCl 500mM, EDTA 1mM, EGTA 1mM,
DTT 1mM, Protease inhibitor cocktail, Phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail #2, Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
#3. Total protein extracts were quantified by Bradford
assay (Sigma Aldrich), following manufacturer’s
instructions. Protein extracts were then processed to be
loaded on NuPAGE Bis-Tris pre-casted mini gels (Life
Technologies) following manufacturer instructions.
Blotting onto nitrocellulose membrane (Life Technologies)
was performed using iBlot System 2 (Life Technologies).
After blocking, membranes were incubated with the
selected primary antibody and then with the appropriate
secondary antibody. Super Signal West Dura Extended
duration substrate (Thermo Scientific) was added to the

GRANT SUPPORT

RNA extraction, RT2 array and single gene
validation

This work was supported by grants from MIUR
[PON01_02782 to M.L.], Ministry of Health [RF-20102305526 to M.L.] and University of Milano-Bicocca
[F.A.R. to M.L. and R.G.].

CellSperse™ solution was used to recover cells
grown on Cultrex®, following manufacturer instructions.
RNeasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used to extract RNA from
cells grown on a thin layer of Cultrex®. RNA samples were
treated with DNase to ensure elimination of genomic
DNA. At the end of the procedure, the RNA concentration
was measured with Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific)
and samples were checked for RNA quality and integrity
by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in denaturing
conditions. One microgram of extracted RNA was then
converted to cDNA by using the RT2 First Strand Kit
(Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
The expression of 84 Human TGF-β Signaling
Targets genes was analyzed by RT2 profiler PCR
array (PAHS-235ZA, Qiagen) using the StepOne
Plus instrument (Applied Biosystems) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Two independent experiments
were performed for each group of treatment. Untreated
cells were used as reference control sample. The mRNA
expression levels of each gene in each cell treatment were
normalized using the expression of the housekeeping
genes B2M, GAPDH, RPLP0, HPRT1 and ACTB. The
results were confirmed by qRT-PCR experiments on
selected genes by using StepOne Plus instrument (Applied
Biosystems). At least three independent experiments were
performed for each single gene validation. The primers
used for qRT-PCR were selected from PrimerBank
[49–51] and are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Data,
normalized for B2M gene, are expressed as fold change
value respect to the untreated cells according to the 2-ΔΔCt
algorithm. The array data discussed in this publication
have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus
[52] and are accessible through GEO Series accession
