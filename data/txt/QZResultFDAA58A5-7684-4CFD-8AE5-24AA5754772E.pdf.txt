ABSTRACT
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase
(PI3K) pathways are often aberrantly activated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
and play critical roles in proliferation and survival of leukemia cells. We provide
evidence that simultaneous targeting of mTOR complexes with the catalytic mTOR
inhibitor OSI-027 and of the p110α subunit of PI3K with the specific inhibitor BYL719 results in efficient suppression of effector pathways and enhanced induction of
apoptosis of leukemia cells. Importantly, such a combined targeting approach results
in enhanced suppression of primitive leukemic progenitors from patients with AML.
Taken together, these findings raise the possibility of combination treatments of
mTOR and p110α inhibitors as a unique approach to enhance responses in refractory
AML.

INTRODUCTION

role in regulating initiation of mRNA translation and
autophagy through its downstream targets 4E-BP1, S6K
and ULK1 [9-11]. Activation of mTORC2 (a complex
formed by mTOR, RICTOR, SIN1, mLST8, PROTOR
and DEPTOR) regulates the pro-survival family of AGC
kinases, including the kinase AKT, leading to effects on
cell metabolism, survival, proliferation, and cytoskeletal
rearrangement [9-11]. Specific mTORC1 inhibition has
been extensively studied using rapamycin, however,
recent evidence suggests the existence of rapamycininsensitive mTORC1 complexes [12-15]. More recently,
a new generation of catalytic mTOR inhibitors has been
developed to target both mTOR complexes [12, 13,
16]. These mTOR inhibitors act by binding to the ATPbinding site of mTOR and thus block the activities of both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 [12, 13, 16]. We have previously
reported that dual targeting of mTORC1 and mTORC2
with OSI-027 results in enhanced antileukemic responses
as compared to treatment with the classic mTORC1
inhibitor, rapamycin [17].

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly fatal
disease, as many patients do not respond to therapy or
eventually relapse [1-3]. For older patients or patients with
co-morbities who cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy,
the treatment options are particularly limited [4]. There
is undoubtedly a need for new therapeutic regimens and
innovative approaches to overcome resistance in AML.
The disease has been associated with dysregulation
and constitutive activation of the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)
signaling pathways, which promote aberrant cell growth
and survival, and induce anti-apoptotic responses [5-8].
mTOR exists in two distinct complexes, mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).
Each complex has distinct characteristics and downstream
effectors, resulting in distinct functional outcomes.
Activation of mTORC1 (a complex composed of mTOR,
Raptor, PRAS40, mLST8 and DEPTOR) plays a central

PI3K has also been identified as an important target
for the treatment of several types of cancer, including
AML [18-23]. Abnormal activation of the PI3K signaling
pathway has been directly correlated to oncogenic activity,
due to its prominent role in mediating cellular growth and
survival [18, 20, 22]. There are three known classes of
PI3K [22, 24]. Class-IA PI3K are heterodimers composed
by a regulatory subunit, p85, and a catalytic subunit p110
[22, 24, 25]. Mutations leading to constitutive activation
of the p110α subunit have been found in several types of
cancer [18-22, 24]. PI3K is activated in AML, however,
the mechanism is unknown, as mutations in PI3K isoforms
have not been found [23, 26]. BYL-719 is a specific classIA PI3K inhibitor, which acts by binding the ATP binding
domain of the p110α subunit [27]. Recently, BYL-719 has
been reported to have significant activity against tumors
carrying mutations in the p110α subunit of PI3K [28, 29].

However, BYL-719 has achieved only modest effects as a
single agent in malignancies with non-mutated PI3K [21,
29-31].
In the present study, we sought to evaluate the
effects of combined targeting of AML cells, using a dual
mTOR inhibitor, OSI-027, and a p110α subunit inhibitor,
BYL-719. Our studies provide evidence that the OSI-027/
BYL-719 combination induces potent and synergistic
anti-leukemic responses in several AML cell lines with
diverse molecular characteristics and in primary leukemic
progenitors (CFU-L) from AML patients.

RESULTS
In initial studies, we examined the effects of
BYL-719 and OSI-027, alone and/or in combination, on

combination for 90 minutes. Equal amounts of total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against
the phosphorylated forms of AKT (pSer-473), rpS6 (pSer-235/236), and 4E-BP1 (pThr-37/46), as indicated. The corresponding blots were
stripped and reprobed with antibodies against total AKT, rpS6, and 4E-BP1, as indicated.

the phosphorylation of PI3K and mTOR downstream
targets. Using different AML cell lines (U937, MM6
and Kasumi-1), we analyzed the effects of these agents
on the phosphorylation of AKT on serine 473 (Ser473),
a marker of mTORC2 activity, and the phosphorylation
of S6 ribosomal protein (rpS6) and eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), markers
of mTORC1 activity. Treatment of cells with BYL719 or OSI-027 alone resulted in a decrease in the
phosphorylation levels of AKT, rpS6, and 4E-BP1 in
most cases (Fig. 1A, 1B and 1C). Addition of BYL-719
did not result in significant differences from the OSI-027dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of rpS6 in U937

or MM6 cells (Fig. 1A and 1B). However, in most cases,
combined treatment with BYL-719 and OSI-027 resulted
in more potent reduction of the phosphorylation levels of
the different proteins (Fig. 1A, 1B and 1C), indicating a
synergistic effect on these effectors of the PI3K/mTOR
pathways. Notably, in Kasumi-1 cells neither BYL-719
nor OSI-027 alone suppressed phosphorylation of AKT on
serine 473, but the combination of the two agents resulted
in potent suppressive effects (Fig. 1C).
In subsequent experiments we evaluated the
effects of combination treatment with BYL-719 and
OSI-027 versus single-drug treatments on viability/cell
proliferation of AML cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2, single-

drug treatments resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation.
However, combination treatment with BYL-719 and OSI027 strongly enhanced the growth inhibitory effects of
each drug alone in all AML cell lines. The half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) and the combination index
(CI) values were calculated for the combination and
single-drug treatments. CI values lower than 1.0 indicate
synergistic effects against proliferation by the combination
treatment, values greater than 1.0 indicate antagonistic
effects, and values equal to 1.0 indicate additive effects.
The IC50 of BYL-719 and OSI-027 on U937 cells were
4.55μM and 0.98μM, respectively, whereas the IC50 of
the combination treatment was 0.43μM (Fig. 2A). The
CI for the combination treatment was 0.54, indicating
a synergistic effect against proliferation of U937 cells.
Similar results were observed for the MM6 (Fig. 2B) and
Kasumi-1 (Fig. 2C) cell lines subjected to single-drug
and combination treatments. The IC50 for BYL-719 and
OSI-027 on the MM6 cell line were 2.43μM and 0.57μM,
respectively, while the combination treatment resulted in
an IC50 of 0.21μM and a CI value of 0.45 again showing
synergism (Fig. 2B). Treatment of Kasumi-1 cells revealed
an IC50 of 0.69μM for BYL-719, 0.26μM for OSI-027,
and 0.15μM for the combination treatment (Fig. 2C). The
CI value on this cell line was 0.78, which also indicates
synergism between BYL-719 and OSI-027.
To determine whether the potent and synergistic
effects of the combined treatment with BYL-719 and OSI027 correlated with induction of pro-apoptotic responses,
we next measured the induction of cellular apoptosis using
flow cytometry analysis for double staining with annexin
V/DAPI. The combination treatment of BYL-719 and
OSI-027 resulted in a statistically significant increase in
the percentage of apoptotic cells, when compared to either
inhibitor alone, in all AML cell lines (Fig. 3) .
To evaluate the anti-leukemic effects induced by the
combination treatment with BYL-719 and OSI-027 in a
more pathophysiologically relevant system, we assessed
effects on leukemic progenitors (CFU-L) using clonogenic
assays in methylcellulose. The combined treatment of
BYL-719 and OSI-027 resulted in greater inhibition of
CFU-L colony growth of leukemic precursors in all lines
(Figs. 4A, 4B, and 4C). Importantly, the combination
resulted in enhanced suppression of primary leukemic
precursors from patients with AML (Fig. 4D), suggesting
that the combination of these agents may provide a better
strategy to target primitive leukemic precursors.

established that catalytic mTOR inhibition enhances the
suppressive effects of cytarabine [17], while other studies
have shown that catalytic mTOR inhibitors are potentially
less immunosuppressive than rapamycin [32]. Taken
together, the results of these studies have suggested that
catalytic mTOR inhibitors may be more optimal agents
for the treatment of malignancies as compared to rapalogs,
exhibiting more potent antineoplastic effects and less
immunosuppression.
Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K using the
LY294002 inhibitor was shown to block proliferation of
primary AML blasts through inhibition of AKT-induced
survival pathways [33]. LY2940002, however, has limited
clinical potential due to toxicity problems and off-target
effects [34]. Inhibition of PI3K by BYL-719 showed
limited efficacy as a single agent in a RAS-driven model
of AML [21]. Here, we present data that BYL-719 has
modest antileukemic effects as a single agent on AML
cells. The relative modest effects of PI3K inhibition alone
can be in part explained by the fact that although PI3K

activity is inhibited, activation of its downstream effectors,
including AKT and mTORC1, is not completely blocked
[28]. This could be explained via engagement of mTOR
by signaling loops that circumvent the inhibition of PI3K
by BYL-719 [28]. Notably, in pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors targeting of both PI3K and mTOR was required
to generate inhibitory effects on cells that were resistant
to the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001 [31]. Regarding
limitations of single mTOR or PI3K targeting in AML
cells, it has been previously demonstrated that mTOR
inhibition leads to activation of PI3K signaling via
upregulation of IGF-1 [35]. Additionally, combinations
of specific mTORC1 inhibitors with PI3K inhibitors may
not be effective as a potential feedback loop involving
mTORC2 activation by growth factors may contribute to
survival of cancer cells [9-11]. Inhibition of mTORC1 or
PI3K alone also effects cytokine production by AML cells
that may induce negative feedback loops [36]. In addition,
mTORC1 inhibition can result in activation of MAPK
signaling, independently of PI3K [37]. Thus, combined

targeting using PI3K and catalytic mTOR inhibitors
provides a better strategy to prevent activation of feedback
loops that lead to resistance to treatment. It should be
noted that AML cells always express the PI3K isoform
p110δ and heterogeneously express p110α and p110β
[23]. Previously, p110δ selective inhibitors exhibited
significant anti-leukemic effects on primary AML patient
samples [38, 39]. Hence, future studies should assess the
differences between targeting p110α and p110δ isoforms
in terms of anti-oncogenic activity in AML. These
studies should also address if inhibition of one isoform
results in leukemic cell survival mechanisms involving
compensation by activation of the other isoforms.
In the present study, we provide evidence that
combination of BYL-719 and OSI-027 results in
more potent inhibition of phosphorylation of mTOR
downstream targets and in synergistic inhibition of
leukemic cell viability and induction of apoptosis. In
addition, we establish that combination of BYL-719
with OSI-027 is much more effective than treatment with
each inhibitor alone in blocking the survival of primitive
leukemic progenitors from AML patients in vitro. Studies
from other groups have shown that dual PI3K-mTORC1/2
inhibitors exhibit antileukemic properties in AML [40-42],
and are consistent with our findings. Altogether, the results
of our studies support the combination of PI3K and mTOR
inhibitors as a potential novel approach for the treatment
of AML that warrants clinical study.

minutes, at final concentrations of 0.25µM and 0.15µM,
respectively.

Clonogenic leukemic progenitor assays in
methylcellulose

MATERIALS AND METHODS

These assays were performed as described in
previous studies [17, 43]. Briefly, peripheral blood or
bone marrow samples were obtained from patients with
AML after obtaining informed consent approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Northwestern University.
Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque
(Sigma Aldrich) sedimentation. To assess the effects of
drugs on leukemic progenitor (CFU-L) colony formation,
cells were plated in methylcellulose (MethoCult™ H4534
Classic without EPO, Stem Cell Technologies), in the
presence of BYL-719 or OSI-027 alone or in combination,
at a final concentration of 1µM. For cell line-derived
CFU-L colony formation, U937 and Kasumi 1 cells were
incubated in methylcellulose with BYL-719 or OSI-027
alone or in combination, at final concentrations of 1µM
and 5µM, respectively. MM6 cells were incubated in
methylcellulose with BYL-719 or OSI-027 alone or in
combination, at a final concentration of 1µM.

Cells and reagents
The U937 and Kasumi-1 human AML cell lines
were purchased from American Type Cell Culture (ATCC).
MM6 cells were purchased from DSMZ. U937 cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), while the Kasumi-1 cell line
was cultured in ATCC modified RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 20% FBS. MM6 cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 µg/ml human
insulin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 mM nonessential amino
acids, and 10% FBS. BYL-719 and OSI-027 were both
purchased from ChemieTek.

Cell lysis and immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer
(50 mM HEPES, pH 7.9; 150 mM NaCl; 4 mM Na
Pyrophosphate; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0; 10 mM NaF;
0.5% Triton-X 100; 10% glycerol) with 1 mM PMSF,
