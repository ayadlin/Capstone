ABSTRACT
Atherosclerosis is known to be the primary underlying factor responsible for
the development of cardiovascular diseases. Suppression of AMP-activated protein
kinase stimulates arterial deposition of excess lipids, resulting in the development
of atherosclerotic lesions. In this study we successfully developed the disease
model of mice and mimicked the therapeutic effect, for that we chose three different
AMP-activated protein kinase activators (IMM-H007, A-769662 and Metformin) to
identify which one has a superior effect in the atherosclerosis model. We combined
the transcriptomes of four groups of mice liver including high-fat diet group and the
experimental groups treated with different AMP-activated protein kinase activators.
We analyzed the increased genes to candidate metabolic and disease pathways.
Compared to the high-fat diet group, a total of 799 differentially expressed genes were
identified in treatment groups. There were 291, 473, and 323 differentially expressed
genes in H007, Metformin, and A-769662 group respectively. And seven statistically
significant pathways were observed in both H007 and Metformin groups. We expect
that gene expression profiling in the mice model would extend our understanding of
atherosclerosis in the molecular level. This study provides a fundamental framework for
future clinical research on human atherosclerosis and new clues for developing novel
drugs for the treatment of atherosclerosis.

INTRODUCTION

injury. It has been reported that genetic variation of apo-E
is linked to plasma lipid levels, which is an independent
risk determinant of atherosclerosis and coronary heart
disease [3]. Atherosclerosis is also a major cause of
ischemic stroke. Although carotid artery plaques and
cardiogenic emboli have been observed as the embolic
sources in patients with cerebral infarction, severe aortic
arch atherosclerotic (AAA) plaques may be detected in
ischemic stroke patients for whom no embolic source has
been identified [4].
AMPK is activated in response to a variety of
conditions that deplete cellular energy levels, such
as nutrient starvation (especially glucose), hypoxia
and exposure to toxins that inhibits the mitochondrial
respiratory chain complex-1, 2. AMPK is a serine/
threonine protein kinase complex consisting of a catalytic

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide and atherosclerosis
is known to be the primary underlying factor responsible
for the development of these diseases [1]. Individuals
with comorbidities such as diabetes and dyslipidemia are
prone to develop pathological changes in the arterial wall,
in such individuals there are chances that may lead to a
state of chronic low grade inflammation and may promote
obesity-linked metabolic disorders and cardiovascular
disease such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome
and atherosclerosis [2]. Atherosclerosis is a complex
inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation
of lipid rich plaques in arterial walls, which is mediated
largely by recruitment of macrophages to the site of

α-subunit (α1 and α2), a scaffolding β-subunit (β1 and β2)
and a regulatory γ-subunit (γ1, γ2 and γ3) [5]. AMPK has a
key role in maintaining the balance between anabolic and
catabolic programs for cellular homeostasis in response to
metabolic stress. Given the functional attributes of AMPK
in glucose/lipid homeostasis, body weight, food intake,
insulin signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis, AMPK
is considered to be a major therapeutic target for the
treatment of metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes
and obesity [6], hence atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis
is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease of
the arterial vessel wall characterized by the thickening
of intima primarily due to monocyte recruitment into
the sub endothelial space [7]. AMPK activators can
effectively inhibit PMA-induced monocyte-to-macrophage
differentiation. Also Vascular suppression of AMPK
stimulates arterial deposition of excess lipids, resulting in
the development of atherosclerotic lesions [8].
In this present study, we chose three different AMPK
activators (IMM-H007, A-769662 and Metformin).
IMM-H007 (triacetyl-3-hydroxyphenyladenosine) is a
derivative of cordycepin, which is an adenosine analog [9].
IMM-H007 was observed to stimulate the phosphorylation
of AMPK and to decrease lipid biosynthesis [10]. It has
been observed to increase the circulating HDL level, and
the cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL, and it can also
enhance in vivo reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) from
macrophages to the plasma, liver, and feces. Furthermore,
recent studies showed that ABCA1 suppression by
IMM-H007 can reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation
in apoE-/- mice [11]. A-769662 is another new activator
of AMPK which increase AMPK activity directly through
the β1 subunit drug binding site [12]. Metformin is an antidiabetic drug which activates AMPK indirectly. It affects
lipid metabolism, lowering plasma triglycerides and free
fatty acids. It was also found to activate the AMPK in
intact cells and in vivo [13]. Based on the previous reports
and studies, we adjusted the dosages of the three AMPK
activators. And he three AMPK agonist lead to the similar
comparable effects by different mechanisms.
There are many advantages of using mice for
experimental atherosclerosis research. For their generation
time is only about 9 weeks [14]. A chronological analysis
of atherosclerosis in the apoE deficient mouse has shown
that the sequential events involved in lesion formation are
strikingly similar to those in well-established larger animal
models of atherosclerosis and in humans [15].
In this study we first established mice models of
atherosclerosis, which were fed with high fat-diet and
combined with the above mentioned AMPK activators
separately. The purpose of this study was to identify which
AMPK activator has a superior effect in the treatment of
atherosclerosis. Since liver is the major organ for drug and
lipid metabolism, systematic studies of gene expression in
hepatic cells treated with high-fat diet and drugs will provide
abundant biomarkers for understanding the basic molecular

mechanism of drug metabolism and protection against
atherosclerosis using AMPK activators. In recent years, global
gene expression analysis approaches based on microarray
and RNA sequencing has been widely applied in various
biomedical studies. For analysis of these transcriptome data
(especially in cancers and cardiovascular diseases), biological
pathways or networks contributes an important role for
connecting different genes and understanding the molecular
mechanisms of various pathophysiological processes [16, 17].
Thus, based on high-throughput sequencing technology, we
constructed and combined the transcriptomes of four groups
of mice liver including high-fat diet group (the control group)
and three experimental groups treated with different AMPK
activators. Then, we mapped the increased genes to candidate
metabolic and disease pathways and systematically compared
the differences of these gene between different experimental
groups.
Gene-expression profiling of atherosclerosis has
recently been used to identify genes and pathways relevant
to vascular pathophysiology. This study will help us to
broaden our knowledge in the molecular mechanism of
drug metabolism and protection against atherosclerosis
using different AMPK activators, and this will also provide
new clues for developing novel drugs for the treatment of
atherosclerosis.

RESULTS

high-fat diet and three AMPK activators
A flow chart representing the experimental design
and model construction was shown in (Figure 1A) at first
mice were fed with high fat diet and 3 different AMPK
activators separately, after the 10 weeks treatment,
mice were killed and their aorta were obtained, then
RNA sequencing was done, further identified DEGs
(differentially expressed genes) between experimental
and control groups (Figure 1B) the whole aorta was
obtained for staining, where we found maximum lesion

apoE-/- mice were measured by Western blot. The Thr-172
phosphorylation of AMPK, which reflects AMPK activity,
was increased by 26% in the IMM-H007 group, by 19% in
the Metformin group, and by 33% in the A-769662 group,
versus the control group. And the structures of these three
drugs were shown in Figure 1H.

group respectively. Cluster analysis of DEGs showed that
all three treatment groups displayed distinct expression
patterns compared to Model group (Figure 2B). However,
we also observed that the expression levels of many
DEGs were different between replications (within the
same group), which indicated that obvious biological
variations were existed in mice liver. We further compared
the composition of DEGs between three treatment groups
(Figure 2C–2D). We observed that all treatment groups
have more up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes.
In addition, we noted that H007 and Metf shared many
DEGs (including 137 up-regulated genes and 23 down
regulated genes), which could partially explain that these
groups are not clustered within replications.
Experimental evidences showed that all the three
AMPK activators can rescue the pathological changes of
atherosclerosis (Figure 1B–1F). Thus, RNA-seq analysis
was applied to discover molecular biomarkers that may
contribute to this treatment effect. Then we evaluated
the feasibility of RNA-seq analysis for identifying
bonafide biomarkers using known genes that associated

Global gene expression analysis of mouse liver
by RNA-seq
Combining the results of two experimental
replications, a total of 20047 unique genes were identified
in mouse liver treated with different AMPK activators
(Supplementary Information 1). The correlation analysis
showed that the overall expression levels are similar
between two replications or different groups, which
also indicated the high quality of RNA-seq analysis
to some extend (Figure 2A). Compared to the control
group (Model), a total of 799 DEGs were identified in
treatment groups (Supplementary Information 2). There
are 291, 473, and 323 DEGs in H007, Metf, and A-76

with atherosclerosis. We systematically annotated DEGs
based on MGI phenotype annotation. We focused on five
types of phenotypes including atherosclerosis, artery,
cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and lipid
metabolism. A total of 46 DEGs were mapped to 49
subclasses of phenotypes (Supplementary Information 3).
We constructed the gene-phenotype relation networks for
the three treatment groups separately (Figure 3A–3C).
Consistent with the overall number of DEGs, H007
and Metf shared more genes than any other group
pairs (Figure 3D, including 8 up-regulated and 2 down
regulated). All three groups have DEGs annotated with
artery, cholesterol metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and
lipid metabolism phenotypes (Figure 3E). However, only
Metf and A-76 group identified DEGs directly associated
with atherosclerosis (only two gene were involved,
including Tnfsf4 and Olr1). Actually, these DEGs were
identified from liver tissue, thus it is reasonable that
DEGs are more directly associated with liver metabolism
rather than artery and atherosclerosis. Nevertheless,

the present RNA-seq analysis did identified known
biomarkers that directly associated with liver metabolism
or atherosclerosis. Many novel key genes may be hidden
in the list of DEGs that associated with atherosclerosis
via liver metabolism. Thus, the DEGs can provide rich
resource for interpreting and comparing the molecular
mechanisms of treatment with different AMPK activators.

Screening of significant biomedical pathways
among DEGs
After treating the mice with high-fat food
and AMPK activators, we systematically annotated
potential biomedical pathways that could be associated
with atherosclerosis based on KEGG database
(Supplementary Information 4). Liver is the target
organ for drug metabolism and lipid metabolism. Thus,
various pathways could be involved in the pathogenesis
or treatment of atherosclerosis via liver functions. We
classified these biomedical pathways into 14 classes,

including environmental Information processing (signal
transduction and signaling molecules and interaction),
diseases (cancers, cardiovascular diseases, endocrine and
metabolic diseases, and immune diseases), metabolism
(carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, glycan
biosynthesis and metabolism, lipid metabolism, and
metabolism of cofactors and vitamins), and organismal
systems (digestive system, endocrine system, and immune
system). In summary, a total of 168 KEGG pathways
were annotated for the expression of DEGs, the detailed
pathway information (including the numbers of the
total pathways and enriched pathways in three groups)
for each class are shown in Figure 4A. The DEGs of
three experimental groups were mainly observed to be
enriched in 21 KEGG pathways (Table 1). Consistent
with the results of phenotype analysis, seven statistically
significant pathways were observed in both H007 and
Metf groups (including calcium signaling pathway,
dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy,
oxytocin signaling pathway, leukocyte trans-endothelial
migration, and regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes).
All the three drugs were AMPK activators, though
AMPK signaling pathway is not identified as a significant
pathway. There were only 4 and 2 DEGs observed in
AMPK signaling pathways for H007 and Metf group
respectively (Figure 4B). Since AMPK signaling
pathway is highly associated with kinase activities and

phosphorylation levels, it was impossible for RNA-seq
analysis to discover post-translational or protein changes.
Therefore, our study was aimed to identify DEGs that are
responsible for atherosclerosis at the level of transcripts.
It should be noted that pathway enrichment analysis may
also miss some important information for interpreting the
mechanism which could be solved by proteomics analysis
in the future. For example, although lipid metabolism
pathways were not identified as statistically significant,
15 DEGs were distributed in five lipid metabolism
pathways (including steroid biosynthesis, arachidonic
acid metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, fatty
acid elongation, glycerophospholipid metabolism and
glycerolipid metabolism).
In the present study, we mainly focused on the
statistically enriched pathways since more DEGs are
involved. Among these pathways, some pathways are
known to possess important roles in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis. For example, calcium signaling pathway
is enriched in both Metf and H007 group (Figure 5A),
microarray analysis of gene expression revealed that
mouse aorta also enriched this pathway [18]. Following
experiments further verified that calcium signaling pathway
is the major controlling factor underlying atherosclerotic
lesion development and involved in the inflammatory
process of atherogenesis [19, 20]. Although KEGG does not
contain pathway that directly associated with atherogenesis,
many other diseases could provide indirect pathways

regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes could be a new target
for atherogenesis. Besides gene difference in the same
pathway, there also exists interesting pathway difference
between different groups. For example, compared to other

γ subunits, is considered to be a major therapeutic target
for the treatment of metabolic diseases including type 2
diabetes, obesity and atherosclerosis [6]. The anti-diabetic
drug metformin activates AMPK indirectly. It is a derivative
of guanidine acts by promoting insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake in muscle and lowers hepatic glucose output, it also
affects lipid metabolism, lowering plasma triglycerides
and free fatty acids, the latter possibly due to inhibition of
catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis [22–24]. A-769662 can
promote whole-body fat oxidation in mice acts by directly
binding on the AMPKβ1 subunits [12], while our previous
work showed that triacetyl-3-hydroxyphenyladenosine
(IMM-H007) activates AMPK by directly binding to
the γ subunit [10]. Although all of these activities have
atheroprotective effects, the importance of AMPK and
the mechanism of AMPK activation for atheroprotection
are not fully understood. Thus, in this study we chose
three different AMPK activators (IMM-H007, A-769662
and Metformin) to compare the effects and discover the
molecular mechanism of the treatment of atherosclerosis
using these activators.
From the graphical representation of lesion
area in the aortic root of control group and drugstreated apoE-/-  mice, with maximum of 353.8682 (units)
for control group and 202.6138 (units), 193.4254 (units)
and 214.2085 (units) for IMM-H007, Metformin and
A-769662 respectively. And from graphical representation
of CD68 positive area in cryosection of aorta determined
by software ImageJ analysis revealed, that 27.7% positive
area for the control group and 14.2%,17.6% and17.5% for
IMM-H007, Metformin and A-769662 respectively.
Our results suggested that all three AMPK activators
were found to have good effect in treating atherosclerosis,
since comparing with the control group the AMPK treated
group was able to demonstrate noticeable difference in the
lesion areas, in both whole aorta and cryosections staining.
We were successfully able to develop the disease model
and mimic the therapeutic effect and identify the known
atherosclerosis related markers through the transcriptional
group. Our study had limitations in many aspects including
the transcription levels of protein and metabolic group,
wherefore more elaborated studies should be conducted
in the future to provide new clues for developing novel
drugs which may provide new markers and mechanisms
to access and treat atherosclerosis.

controlled temperature. They were treated with CMC-Na
as the control group, A-769662 (30 mg/kg, i.p.), Metformin
(260 mg/kg, i.g.), and IMM-H007 (200 mg/kg, i.g.) once
daily. We recorded the weight and food intake every week. All
procedures were performed in accordance with the regulations
of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences and Peking Union Medical College (Beijing, China).

Evaluation of aortic atherosclerotic lesion
formation
To assess the differences in atherosclerotic lesions
size between the experimental and control groups, en face
lesion analysis was carried out after 10 weeks treatment
with high fat diet (HFD) or AMPK activators, the whole
aorta and 7 μm-thick frozen section of aortic sinus were
obtained and stained with Oil Red O. The mice aorta
preparation and the quantification of atherosclerosis
lesions were conducted as previously described [25].
Lesion areas were marked using ImageJ software.

Atherosclerosis analysis
To induce atherosclerosis in apoE-/- mice, they were
fed with western diet (containing 1.25% cholesterol)
and libitum for 10 weeks. Mice aorta preparation and
atherosclerosis quantification were conducted with
modifications as previously described [25]. The entire
aorta was stained with Oil Red O for En face analysis
and the images were captured with a Nikon D600 digital
camera. Aortic roots were frozen in OCT, and 7-μm-thick
sections were stained with Oil Red O for lipid content and
anti-CD68 antibody for macrophage analysis. Lesion areas
were quantified with ImageJ software.

Western blot analysis
The proteins in apoE-/- liver were lysed in RIPA
buffer containing a cocktail of protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Roche). After quantified with BCA protein assay
kit (MACGENE, China), proteins were electrophoresed by
SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and transferred to PVDF membrane
(Millipore). The 5% BSA was used to block PVDF
membranes. Then membranes were incubated with antibodies
antibodies aganist p-AMPK, AMPK, β-actin (all from Cell
Signaling Technology). Membranes were subsequently
incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibodies (ZSGB-BIO, China) and SuperSignal West Pico
chemiluminescent substrate (Millipore).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal model
In this experiment we used Male apoE-/- mice on the
C57BL/6 background, weighing between 20–25 g. All
mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal
Technology Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). Mice were fed with
high fat diet (10% lard, 1.2% cholesterol) in a pathogen-free
animal environment with 12 h light/12 h dark cycles under

Illumina RNA-Seq and data analysis
The entire RNA was treated with RQ1 DNase
(promega) to remove DNA. The quality and quantity
of the purified RNA were determined by measuring

the absorbance at 260 nm/280 nm (A260/A280) using
smartspec plus (BioRad). RNA integrity was further
verified by 1.5% Agarose gel electrophoresis. Then for
each sample, 10 μg of total RNA was used for RNA-seq
library preparation. Polyadenylated mRNAs were purified
and concentrated with oligo (dT)-conjugated magnetic
beads (invitrogen) before they were used for directional
RNA-seq library preparation. Purified mRNAs were iron
fragmented at 95°C followed by end repair and 5′ adaptor
ligation. Then reverse transcription was performed with
RT primer harboring 3′ adaptor sequence and randomized
hexamer. The cDNAs were purified and amplified and the
PCR products corresponding to 200–500 bps were also
purified and quantified and were stored at –80°C until
used for sequencing. For high-throughput sequencing,
the libraries were prepared following the manufacturer’s
instructions and applied to illumina NextSeq 500 system
for 151 nt pair-end sequencing by ABlife. Inc. (Wuhan,
China). Following analysis of raw data (Fastq files) was
obtained by ABlife Inc. using a similar workflow as
previously described [26]. The accurate readings were
aligned in the Ensembl Mus musculus genome using
TopHat2 software [27]. Then, gene expression levels
were calculated using FPKM (reads per kilobase per
million mapped reads) method, which considered the
length and read counts uniquely mapped to each gene.
The edgeR software was used to further identify DEGs
between experimental and control groups [28]. Genes with
P value less than 0.01 and fold change larger than 2 were
considered statistically significant.

Statistical analysis
Correlation analysis of experimental replications
and groups were performed by the R soft, while clustering
analysis was performed by the MeV toolkit [29]. For both
correlation and clustering analysis, Pearson method was
applied. The known phenotype information were obtained
from the MGI (Mouse Genome Informatics) database [30].
The gene-phenotype relation network was constructed using
the Cytoscape software (Version: 3.2) [31]. Biomedical
pathways were based on the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes) database [32]. For enrichment
statistics, the whole genes identified in the RNA-seq
analysis was set as background. Pathways with P value
(by Fisher’s exact test) less than 0.05 and fold change larger
than 2 were considered statistically significant.
