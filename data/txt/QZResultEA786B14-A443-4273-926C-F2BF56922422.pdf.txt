ABSTRACT
Galectin-1 is a β-galactoside binding protein secreted by many types of
aggressive cancer cells. Although many studies have focused on the role of galectin-1
in cancer progression, relatively little attention has been paid to galectin-1 as an
extracellular therapeutic target. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying
galectin-1-mediated cancer progression, we established galectin-1 knock-down
cells via retroviral delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against galectin-1 in two
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T. Ablation of
galectin-1 expression decreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and doxorubicin
resistance. We found that these effects were caused by decreased galectin-1-integrin
β1 interactions and suppression of the downstream focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/cSrc pathway. We also found that silencing of galectin-1 inhibited extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
signaling, thereby down-regulating survivin expression. This finding implicates STAT3
as a transcription factor for survivin. Finally, rescue of endogenous galectin-1 knockdown and recombinant galectin-1 treatment both recovered signaling through the
FAK/c-Src/ERK/STAT3/survivin pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that
extracellular galectin-1 contributes to cancer progression and doxorubicin resistance
in TNBC cells. These effects appear to be mediated by galectin-1-induced up-regulation
of the integrin β1/FAK/c-Src/ERK/STAT3/survivin pathway. Our results imply that
extracellular galectin-1 has potential as a therapeutic target for triple-negative breast
cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Galectin-1, encoded by the LGALS1 gene, was first
identified as a β-galactoside binding protein [4]. Galectin-1
has a conserved carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD)
consisting of about 130 amino acids that mediates binding
to carbohydrate-rich regions of cell surface proteins
[4, 5]. Moreover, galectin-1 is involved in cell
transformation via direct interactions with cell surface
oncogenic proteins such as integrins, laminin, and
fibronectin, leading to subsequent cancer progression
[6–8]. In addition, many studies have investigated
the function of galectin-1 in the immunosuppressive

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are defined
as a subset of breast tumors with absent or low levels
of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR),
and HER2 expression [1]. Since they lack expression of
these three receptors, patients with TNBC have limited
treatment options and short life expectancies and are
associated with poor prognosis [2, 3]. Therefore, there is
an urgent need to identify new target molecules for more
effective and sustainable therapies for treating TNBC.

mechanisms of human melanoma [9], neuroblastoma [10],
and pancreatic carcinoma [11]. However, few reports have
investigated the potential of galectin-1 as an extracellular
therapeutic target, primarily because galectin-1 is
predominantly a secretory protein. Therefore, we were
motivated to investigate the potential of galectin-1 as a
TNBC-specific extracellular therapeutic target molecule,
even though galectin-1 is a typical secretory protein.
Integrins are typical cell adhesion receptors related
to cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion
in various cancer cells [12–15]. The integrin family
consists of 24 αβ heterodimeric groups. The α subunit
determines the binding specificity of a given integrin
to its cognate ligands, whereas the β subunit drives
numerous downstream signaling through interactions
with the cytoskeleton [16]. Interestingly, the integrin
β1 subunit has been reported to bind galectin-1 directly
and to activate cytoskeletal-associated focal adhesion
kinase (FAK) [7]. Activation of FAK, in turn, induces
downstream c-Src or ERK signaling-mediated cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion in
various cancer cells [17–20].
The transcription factor signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is well known to play
crucial roles in immunosuppression and tumorigenesis
[21–25]. STAT3 is activated by diverse growth factors,
hormones, and cytokines. After phosphorylation of
Tyr705, STAT3 forms a dimer and translocates to the
nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor [26].
Tyr705 phosphorylation of STAT3 is mediated by
tyrosine kinases such as EGFR [27], JAK [28], and c-Src
[29] and activation of downstream signaling results in
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion [30]. Nuclear
STAT3 binds to the consensus sequences of promoter
regions of target genes such as c-Fos, HIF-1α, c-Myc,
Twist, and survivin, thereby driving their transcription
[30–35]. STAT3 can also be phosphorylated at Ser727
by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which
augments the effect of Tyr705 phosphorylation [36].
However, the precise role of Ser727-phosphorylated
STAT3 remains controversial.
Survivin is a 16.5 kDa protein that is classified as a
member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family
of anti-apoptotic proteins [37]. Survivin can bind caspase-3,
a protease effector of cell death, thereby inhibiting its
activity [38]. Survivin has been shown to be abundantly
expressed in many human cancers [37], and its expression
is increased by many transcription factors, including Sp1
[39], HIF-1α [40], Egr-1 [41], and STAT3 [35].
We found that galectin-1 drives doxorubicin
resistance via direct interaction with integrin β1, which
in turn activates FAK/c-Src/ERK/STAT3 signaling.
This phenomenon culminates in nuclear translocation of
STAT3, a transcription factor driving survivin expression,
in triple-negative breast cancer cells.

Galectin-1 is overexpressed in patients with
triple negative breast cancer and ablation of
galectin-1 decreases secretion and cell surface
level of galectin-1
To investigate the effect of galectin-1 ablation on
breast cancer cells, we established galectin-1 knockdown cells using two shRNA constructs recognizing
different target sequences (Gal-1 sh1 and Gal-1 sh2).
Cells expressing scrambled shRNA were used as controls
(Cont sh). We observed higher levels of galectin-1 in
the two triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines,
MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T, than in non-TNBC cell lines
(Figure 1A). Based on this observation, we knocked down
galectin-1 in MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells. We then
confirmed that the amount of secreted galectin-1 was
decreased in the culture medium of galectin-1 knockdown cells (Figure 1B, 1C). The cell surface protein
biotinylation assay also showed that the level of cell
surface galectin-1 was decreased in the galectin-1 knockdown cells. Cytosolic ERK was not detected by both cell
surface labeling experiments (Figure 1D). In addition,
flow cytometry analyses confirmed the decreased labeling
of FITC in the cell surface of galectin-1 knock-down cells
compared to control shRNA cells (Figure 1E). The results
indicate that galectin-1 attached to other cell surface
receptor protein after secretion.
Galectin-1 expression is elevated in highly
metastatic human breast tumors [42] and has been shown
to be correlated with poor prognosis in patients with
aggressive breast cancer [43]. To confirm this relationship,
we analyzed galectin-1 expression in breast cancer tissue
specimens by western blotting (Supplementary Table 1).
Galectin-1 was significantly up-regulated in patients with
TNBC compared to patients with non-TNBC (Figure 1F).
However, we could not observe galectin-1 expression in
normal breast tissues obtained from non-TNBC or TNBC
patients (Supplementary Figure 1).

Ablation of galectin-1 decreases cell migration
and invasion
Based on previous work demonstrating that
galectin-1 can activate cell migration and invasion in
various cancer cell lines [44, 45], we investigated the
effect of galectin-1 knock-down on the migration and
invasion of human breast cancer cells. Figure 2A and 2B
indicate that ablation of galectin-1 resulted in significant
inhibition of cell migration of galectin-1 knock-down cells
compared to control cells. The healed rate of the wounded
area was reduced by 50% and 40% in MDA-MB-231
galectin-1 shRNA cells and Hs578T galectin-1 shRNA
cells respectively, compared to each control shRNA cells

with different human galectin-1-targeting sequences was confirmed by western blot analysis (MDA-MB-231, Gal-1 sh1 and Gal-1 sh2;

(Figure 2A). The ability to migrate through the transwell
was also decreased in galectin-1 knock-down cells by
more than 50% (Figure 2B). In addition, we could observe
significant reduction of cell invasion (90% in MDAMB-231 and 50% in Hs578T) galectin-1 knock-down cells
compared to each control shRNA cells (Figure 2C).

test whether the extracellular domain of galectin-1 affects
survivin expression, control cells were subjected to cotreatment with doxorubicin and anti-galectin-1 antibodies,
which can neutralize extracellular galectin-1. Interestingly,
when cells were co-treated with doxorubicin and antigalectin-1 antibodies, the presence of the anti-galectin-1
antibodies accelerated the suppression of survivin
expression and induction of caspase-3 activity (Figure
4C, 4D). Moreover, when cells were co-treated with
doxorubicin and recombinant human galectin-1, survivin
expression was rescued, and the increased caspase-3
activity was attenuated by recombinant human galectin-1
in galectin-1 knock-down cells (Figure 4E, 4F). To
confirm that extracellular galectin-1 up-regulates survivin
expression, BT474, MCF7, and KPL4 cells (which express
low levels of galectin-1) were co-treated with doxorubicin
and recombinant human galectin-1 (Figure 4G, 4H). We
found that treatment with recombinant human galectin-1
induced expression of survivin mRNA, up-regulated
survivin protein level, and potentiated doxorubicin
resistance (MCF7 cells do not express caspase-3). These
results suggest that ablation of galectin-1 attenuates
doxorubicin resistance via down-regulation of survivin
expression.

Galectin-1 silencing promotes doxorubicininduced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells
To determine the effect of galectin-1 silencing on
the drug sensitivity of human breast cancer cells, we
induced apoptosis by treatment with doxorubicin, which
damages cellular DNA. The results shown in Figure 3A
and 3B indicate that treatment of doxorubicin resulted in
massive cell death of galectin-1 knock-down cells in a
dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, whereas cell
death in control shRNA cells was relatively attenuated
compared with galectin-1 knock-down cells. After
doxorubicin treatment for 72 h, growth was inhibited
by approximately 98% in galectin-1 knock-down cells,
whereas growth was inhibited by only 79% in control cells
(Figure 3B). To further confirm the effect of galectin-1
ablation on drug sensitivity, we analyzed the cell cycle
by flow cytometry. We found that the sub-G1 apoptotic
fraction was significantly higher in galectin-1 knock-down
cells after doxorubicin treatment than in control shRNA
cells (Figure 3C, Supplementary Figure 2). These results
suggest that silencing of galectin-1 enhanced drug-induced
cell death by increasing apoptosis.

Galectin-1-induced chemoresistance by survivin
is mediated by the FAK/c-Src/ERK/STAT3
signaling pathway
Based on our finding that galectin-1 ablation
inhibited survivin expression in human breast cancer
cells, we investigated the mechanism by which galectin-1
promotes survivin expression. Previous reports have
indicated that survivin expression is increased by
various transcription factors, such as Sp1 [39], HIF1α [40], Egr-1 [41], and STAT3 [35]. To determine the
transcriptional regulator of survivin in our system, we
performed cell fractionation experiments to determine the
effect of galectin-1 silencing on the nuclear localization
of candidate translocation factors that could potentially
decrease survivin expression. As shown in Figure  5A
and Supplementary Figure 3, only STAT3 nuclear
translocation was blocked by galectin-1 silencing. We also
observed reductions in nuclear translocation of Tyr705phosphorylated and Ser727-phosphorylated STAT3 in
galectin-1 knock-down cells. Phosphorylation of these two
residues has been shown to be required for STAT3 nuclear
translocation [26, 48]. In addition, consistent with results
obtained in cells with stably silenced galectin-1-expression,
control cells treated with anti-galectin-1 antibodies
exhibited decreased level of STAT3 (Figure 5B). When the
galectin-1 knock-down cells were treated with recombinant
human galectin-1, nuclear translocation of Tyr705-and
Ser727-phosphorylated STAT3 was restored to normal
levels (Figure 5C). These results suggest that extracellular
galectin-1 increases survivin expression by regulating

Silencing of galectin-1 enhances sensitivity
to doxorubicin by down-regulating survivin
expression
Survivin is a well-known member of the IAP
(inhibitor of apoptosis protein) family, whose members
can disrupt apoptotic signaling pathways, resulting in cell
survival [46]. Motivated by the recent finding that survivin
expression is up-regulated in TNBC cells [47], we analyzed
survivin expression in breast cancer tissue specimens by
western blotting. We found that survivin expression was
significantly elevated in patients with TNBC compared
with patients with non-TNBC breast cancer (Figure 1F).
However, in normal breast tissues, we could not
observe survivin expression (Supplementary Figure 1).
To investigate whether the increase of doxorubicininduced apoptosis in galectin-1 knock-down cells was due
to the change in survivin expression, cells treated with
doxorubicin were analyzed by western blotting and qRTPCR. Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in significant
reduction of survivin expression in galectin-1 knock-down
cells, whereas survivin expression was suppressed to a
lesser extent in control cells (Figure 4A, 4B).
Galectin-1 is a secreted protein that binds to
carbohydrate-rich regions of cell surface proteins [4, 5]. To

STAT3 nuclear translocation. Since previous publications
have reported that STAT3 is physically associated with
the survivin promoter region (-1231/-1009) [35], we
tested whether changes in survivin level by galectin-1
ablation might be mediated by STAT3. The results in
Supplementary Figure 3B indicated that the association of
STAT3 with the survivin promoter region was decreased
in galectin-1 shRNA cells compared to control shRNA
cells, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays. These results indicate that silencing of galectin-1
suppresses STAT3 binding to survivin promoter via
reduction of STAT3 nuclear translocation.
To confirm the effect of STAT3 phosphorylation
on survivin expression, cells were treated with S3I-201,
a STAT3 inhibitor, to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation
and nuclear translocation [49]. Cells treated with S3I201 exhibited decreased survivin mRNA and protein
levels compared to non-treated control cells (Figure 5D,
Supplementary Figure 3C). In addition, doxorubicin and
S3I-201 synergistically reduced cell survival and survivin
protein level in galectin-1 knock-down cells, whereas
the magnitudes of their synergistic effects were reduced
in control cells (Figure 5E). We also observed enhanced
levels of caspase-3 cleavage in galectin-1 knock-down
cells co-treated with doxorubicin and S3I-201 (Figure 5E).
Residue Ser727 on STAT3 has been reported to
be phosphorylated by ERK [50]. When we treated cells
with U0126, a MEK inhibitor, we observed decreased
Ser727 phosphorylation in STAT3 and decreased survivin
expression (Figure 5F, Supplementary Figure 3D). To
further confirm the effect of the ERK pathway on DNA
damage-induced apoptosis, we determined the effect of
U0126 on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. As shown in
Figure 5G, galectin-1 knock-down cells co-treated with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

U0126 and doxorubicin exhibited significantly reduced
survival and survivin level, whereas caspase-3 activity
was enhanced. Less prominent decreases were observed
in control cells (Figure 5G). Taken together, these
observations suggest that galectin-1-dependent modulation
of doxorubicin resistance is enhanced by survivin via
ERK-induced STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation, at least in
the cell lines examined here.
Based on our finding that ERK phosphorylates
STAT3 on Ser727, we investigated whether Tyr705
phosphorylation of STAT3 is stimulated by galectin-1.
One previous study reported that Tyr705 phosphorylation
of STAT3 is mediated by a tyrosine kinase, c-Src [29].
Moreover, c-Src is known to act as a central molecule
that up-regulates the ERK pathway [51]. Therefore,
we hypothesized that galectin-1-induced doxorubicin
resistance via regulation of survivin expression might be
mediated by c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr705
and the ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser727 in
STAT3. To verify this in our cell lines, we transfected cells
with HA-tagged c-Src or treated cells with the Src kinase
inhibitor PP2 and examined the levels of downstream
signaling molecules. Overexpression of HA-tagged c-Src
increased the levels of phosphorylated c-Raf, MEK1/2,
and ERK and also increased the phosphorylation of STAT3
on Tyr705 and Ser727. c-Src expression also increased
survivin levels in our cell lines (Figure 6A, Supplementary
Figure 3E). Accordingly, treatment with PP2 resulted in
decreased c-Raf, MEK1/2, and ERK phosphorylation,
decreased STAT3 Tyr705/Ser727 phosphorylation,
and decreased expression of survivin in our cell lines
(Figure 6B, Supplementary Figure 3F). In addition,
in doxorubicin-treated galectin-1 knock-down cells,
c-Src overexpression increased cell viability, increased

expression were attenuated, whereas caspase-3 cleavage
was increased (Figure 6D). These results collectively
suggest that ablation of galectin-1 decreases doxorubicin

resistance via down-regulation of the c-Src/ERK/STAT3/
survivin pathway.

human galectin-1 (lanes 9, 10, Figure 7C). To confirm
the role of integrin β1-galectin-1 binding in survivinmediated doxorubicin resistance, MDA-MB-231 cells
and Hs578T control cells were transfected with siRNA
targeting integrin β1. Upon siRNA-mediated silencing
of integrin β1, downstream FAK/c-Src activities were
decreased. These effects were followed by reduced c-Raf,
MEK1/2, ERK, and STAT3 phosphorylation and reduced
survivin expression on both the protein and mRNA levels
(Figure 7D, 7E). Also, treatment with doxorubicin resulted
in massive cell death, decreased survivin expression, and
greater caspase-3 cleavage in integrin β1 knock-down cells
compared to non-transfected control cells (Figure 7F).
These results suggest that galectin-1 inhibits drug-induced
apoptotic cell death by directly binding to cell surface
integrin β1, thereby modulating the downstream FAK/cSrc/ERK/STAT3/survivin pathway.

Galectin-1 binding to integrin β1 potentiates
doxorubicin resistance by driving the FAK/c-Src/
ERK/STAT3/survivin pathway
We previously demonstrated that galectin-1
enhances doxorubicin resistance via modulation of
the c-Src/ERK/STAT3/survivin pathway. Galectin-1 is
present in both intracellular and extracellular space and
the functions of secreted galectin-1 are mediated by its
binding to various cell surface proteins such as integrin
β1 [7]. This interaction activates cytoskeletal-associated
proteins, FAK, and downstream c-Src/ERK pathways. To
verify this interaction in our cell lines, we investigated
whether galectin-1 binds directly to integrin β1 on the cell
surface using a cross-linking reagent, BS3. As shown in
Figure 7A, galectin-1 binds directly to integrin β1 on the
cell surface. Moreover, ablation of galectin-1 decreased
its binding to integrin β1. Interestingly, galectin-1-integrin
β1 cross-linked bands migrated at an apparent molecular
weight 30 kDa larger than that of integrin β1 bands in
input samples. These results indicate that the dimeric form
of galectin-1 (28 kDa) was bound to integrin β1.
Based on these results, we treated cells with
anti-galectin-1 antibodies to neutralize the actions
of extracellular galectin-1. Alternatively, we treated
cells with recombinant human galectin-1 to mimic the
effects of secreted galectin-1. We observed inhibition
of galectin-1-integrin β1 binding in control cells treated
with anti-galectin-1 antibodies (lane 6, Figure 7B). We
also observed induction of galectin-1-integrin β1 binding
in galectin-1 knock-down cells treated with recombinant

Rescue of galectin-1 ablation recovers
doxorubicin resistance via restoration of the

Based on our finding that galectin-1 down-regulates
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by directly binding to
integrin β1, thereby activating the downstream FAK/c-Src/
ERK/STAT3/survivin pathway, we next examined whether
galectin-1-mediated chemoresistance is mediated by the
FAK/c-Src/ERK/STAT3/survivin pathway. Recombinant
human galectin-1was prepared (Supplementary Figure 4A)
and used to treat galectin-1 knock-down cells and BT474,

of galectin-1. Upon treatment with recombinant human

and STAT3 phosphorylation. This treatment also downregulated survivin levels in our cell lines (Figure 8B).
To further assess the effect of galectin-1 on FAK/cSrc/ERK/STAT3 activity and survivin expression, we
reintroduced a shRNA-resistant version of the pSuper
galectin-1 construct into MDA-MB-231 cells. We also
introduced Hs578T pSuper galectin-1 shRNA clone 1 into
cells (Figure 8C, Supplementary Figure 4D). We found
that reintroduction of galectin-1 restored phosphorylation
of FAK, c-Src, c-Raf, MEK1/2, ERK, and STAT3 in
galectin-1 knock-down cells. The results shown in
Figure 8 collectively suggest that silencing of galectin-1
efficiently decreases integrin β1 downstream signaling.

Based on our finding that galectin-1 is effectively secreted
from TNBC cells, we focused on the extracellular action
of secreted galectin-1 on TNBC cells. We found that
extracellular galectin-1 suppressed doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis by regulating integrin β1 downstream signaling,
suggesting that galectin-1 is a novel molecular therapeutic
marker.
We also found that galectin-1 was overexpressed
in TNBC cell lines compared to non-TNBC cell lines.
In addition, galectin-1 expression was significantly upregulated in patients with TNBC compared with patients
with non-TNBC. Moreover, we confirmed the binding
of galectin-1 to the cell surface via its interaction with
integrin β1, indicating that galectin-1 is a potential
TNBC-specific cell surface marker. Using a combination
of galectin-1 silencing, treatment with anti-galectin-1
antibodies, and treatment with recombinant galectin-1, we
found that galectin-1 plays a seminal role in TNBC cells
by regulating FAK/c-Src/ERK/STAT3 signaling.
Survivin, a member of the IAP family [38, 47], is
a well-known cell cycle regulatory protein that interacts
with mitotic spindle microtubules during mitosis [53].
Previous study has reported that survivin down-regulates
the activity of caspase-3/7/9 and survivin overexpression
enhances resistance to apoptosis induced by cell death
signaling [54]. We found that survivin was overexpressed
in TNBC cell lines compared to non-TNBC cell lines, and
that ablation of galectin-1 attenuated doxorubicin-induced
survivin expression, leading to enhanced apoptotic cell
death. We conclude that the increase in doxorubicininduced apoptotic cell death in galectin-1-silenced cells is
due to suppressed survivin level.
STAT3 is thought to drive the transcription of
various genes that up-regulate angiogenesis, cell cycle
progression, and cell survival [30–35]. Among these

DISCUSSION
Among the various breast cancer subtypes, TNBC is
distinguished by its highly aggressive phenotype and poor
prognostic features [2, 3]. Hence, intense attention has
focused on finding therapeutics for TNBC. Since TNBC
cells lack the HER2 cell surface receptor and nuclear
hormone receptors, targeted therapeutics such as herceptin
(which targets HER2) and estrogen receptor-targeting
drugs are not suitable [42, 43]. Therefore, much effort has
been spent in the identification of a specific therapeutic
marker that can be used as a TNBC target molecule. As
part of this effort, we focused on galectin-1. This focus
was motivated by the recent finding that galectin-1
expression is significantly up-regulated in TNBC cells
[52]. We established galectin-1 knock-down cell lines
using two TNBC cell lines that endogenously express
galectin-1, MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T, and determined
the effects of galectin-1 silencing in these cell lines.
To date, many studies have indicated that intracellular
galectin-1 promotes cancer progression [44–46, 48, 51].

resulted in suppression of survivin expression. We also
observed that pharmacological inhibition of MEK or
c-Src activity decreased survivin expression. These
results suggest that galectin-1-mediated modulation of
survivin expression results from activated c-Src and ERK
signaling, leading to phosphorylation of STAT3 on Tyr705
and Ser727 and subsequent translocation of STAT3 to the
nucleus, where it drives the transcription of survivin.
Galectin-1 is a commonly secreted protein that
interacts with various extracellular matrix proteins [4, 5].
Integrins are glycoproteins with galactosyl residues and
β1 subunit of integrin was reported to directly interact
with galectin-1 [7]. In agreement with previous studies,
we confirmed that galectin-1 binds to integrin β1. We
also found that the FAK/c-Src/ERK/STAT3/survivin
pathway, which is downstream of integrin β1, is inhibited
by galectin-1 silencing. In addition, after treatment
with doxorubicin, cell viability and survivin expression
were further decreased in integrin β1-knock-down cells
compared to control cells. This finding suggests that
integrin β1 mediates galectin-1 signaling.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that galectin-1
plays a pivotal role in the regulation of key processes
in cancer cells, such as migration, invasion, and
chemoresistance, by modulating FAK and ERK signaling
and survivin level. We propose that silencing of galectin-1
attenuates survivin expression by decreasing the interaction
of survivin with integrin β1. This decreases FAK and c-Src
phosphorylation, which in turn inhibits phosphorylation
of STAT3 on Tyr705. As a result of the decrease in c-Src
phosphorylation, downstream ERK signaling is attenuated,
and ERK-induced STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation is
decreased. Since STAT3 activity is suppressed, STAT3
does not dimerize or translocate to the nucleus, resulting
in decreased survivin expression. We propose that cell
surface-bound galectin-1, which up-regulates intracellular
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

signaling culminating in survivin expression and resistance
to doxorubicin, is a promising TNBC-specific therapeutic
target (Supplementary Figure 5).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids
shRNA constructs targeting different sequences of
human galectin-1 and scrambled shRNA constructs were
kindly donated by Dr. Gabriel A. Rabinovich (Buenos
Aires University, Buenos Aires, Argentina). Constructs
driving the expression of FLAG-tagged galectin-1 and
HA-tagged c-Src were kindly provided by Dr. Kuo-I Lin
(National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan) and Dr.
Wook Jin (Gachon University, Incheon, Korea). Using
the galectin-1-WT construct as a backbone, an shRNAresistant galectin-1 construct harboring a wobble mutation
was produced by a two-step PCR procedure employing
the overlap extension PCR method. Briefly, in the first
step, two PCR reactions were performed. One reaction
was performed with primers 1 and 2; the other reaction
was performed with primers 3 and 4. Amplifications were
performed using a Pfu DNA polymerase kit (Elpis Biotech,
Daejeon, Korea). The two products from the first set of
PCR reactions were mixed in equimolar concentrations

replenished with fresh medium. After 24 h, the medium
was harvested and mixed with 100% trichloroacetic acid
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at a ratio of 4:1 (v/v). After 15
min incubation on ice, the mixture was centrifuged for
10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4°C. After completely removing
the supernatant, 1 ml of ice cold acetone was added, after
which the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000
rpm at 4°C. TCA was removed by adding 500 mM TrisHCl. The gel-like precipitates were lysed, resuspended
in 1× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, resolved by
SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by western blotting.

Cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates and
incubated until reaching approximately 90% confluency,
after which they were serum starved overnight. Wounded
areas were generated by scraping the plate monolayer with
a pipette tip and cells were treated with cycloheximide (10
μM) to inhibit protein synthesis. After 24 h, wound closure
was analyzed under a microscope. The wound closure
rate was calculated using the following formula: (width
of initial wounded area – final width of wounded area) /
width of initial wounded area × 100 (%).

Cell surface labeling

Transwell migration and invasion assays

Cells were detached with diluted trypsin/EDTA,
after which DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to
inactivate the trypsin. The detached cells were washed
with PBS and incubated with galectin-1 antibodies (10 μg/
ml, R&D systems) in 3% (w/v) BSA/PBS for 1 hour. The
cells were then washed three times with PBS and filtered
through a cell strainer. Cell surface-associated fluorescence
measurements were performed using a FACScan flow
cytometer (Becton & Dickinson Biosciences). Data were
analyzed using Cell Quest software.

Cell migration assays were performed using 8 μm
pore size transwell chambers (Corning, NY, USA). The
lower chamber was filled with normal culture medium
(DMEM with 10% FBS). Cells were suspended in DMEM
with 1% FBS and seeded in the upper chamber. After
18 h, cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and the
number of cells on the bottom surface of the polycarbonate
membrane was counted using an optical microscope. The
same procedure was used for cell invasion assays, except
that the upper chamber was filled with matrigel.

Cell proliferation and viability assays

Western blot analyses

For cell proliferation assays, cells were seeded
at 2 × 104 cells per well in 12-well culture plates. Cells
were harvested by trypsinization every 24 h for 4 days,
resuspended in 1 ml of medium, and counted in triplicate
using a hemocytometer.
For cell viability assays, cells were seeded at 5 ×
103 cells per well in 96-well plates and exposed to the
indicated concentrations of doxorubicin. Cell viability
was measured by adding 20 μl of 10 mg/ml MTT
(3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to 100 μl of culture
medium and incubating the mixture for an additional 3 h
at 37°C. Next, the medium was removed, and the resultant
formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(Sigma). The optical density of each solution was assessed
at 590 nm using a Multiscan EX spectrophotometer
(Thermo, Vantaa, Finland).

Cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in
lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM EDTA, 150
mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 20
mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 1× protease inhibitor (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland)]. The proteins in the resultant extracts
were boiled for 10 min in SDS sample buffer, separated
on SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Whatman, Dassel, Germany). After blocking
with 5% skim milk in TBS-T for 1 h, the membranes were
incubated overnight with the appropriate primary antibodies.
Membranes were then washed once with TBS-T and
incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibodies for 2 h. Immunoreactive bands were
visualized with the WEST-ZOL-plus Western Blot Detection
System (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea).

Immunoprecipitation assays

Cell cycle analyses by flow cytometry

For immunoprecipitation (IP) assays, 300 µg of
total protein lysate was incubated overnight with antigalectin-1 antibody (1µg/ml) at 4°C. Protein G Sepharose
4 Fast Flow 50% slurry (w/v) (GE Healthcare, Piscataway,
NJ, USA) was then added, after which the reactions were
incubated for 3 h at 4°C. The resultant immunoprecipitates
were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. After
complete removal of the supernatants, the beads were
resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 10 min,
resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by western blotting.

Cells were harvested with trypsin, washed with
PBS, and fixed in 100% ice cold methanol overnight at
-20°C. Fixed cells were incubated in 50 μg/ml of
propidium iodide (PI) in PBS supplemented with 1 mg/
ml RNase for 30 min. Cell cycle analyses were performed
using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton & Dickinson
Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using Cell Quest
software. All experiments were repeated at least three
times.

(RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR)

Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA), after which bound
GST-tagged protein was eluted in elution buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 10 mM reduced glutathione). To remove
the reduced glutathione from the eluate, the buffer was
replaced with PBS during concentration. Next, 10 μl (10
units) of thrombin solution was added for each mg of
tagged protein in the eluate, after which the mixture was
incubated at room temperature for 24 h. Once digestion
was completed, GST was removed using a glutathione
Sepharose 4B column (BIO-RAD).

RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (MRC,
Cincinnati, OH), and subsequent RT-PCR was carried out
using ReverTra Ace® qPCR RT Master Mix (TOYOBO).
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with a SYBR
FAST qPCR kit (KAPA) in a Thermal Cycler Dice (Takara,
Otsu, Shiga, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The C(t) value was normalized using GAPDH
as a control. The following primers were used: GAPDH
(FWD: 5′-TCA GTG GTG GAC CTG ACC TGA CC-3′,
RV: 5′-TGC TGT AGC CAA ATT CGT TGT CAT ACC3′), galectin-1 (FWD: 5′-CAA CCC TCG CTT CAA CGC
CCA CG-3′, RV: 5′-CGT ATC CAT CTG GCA GCT TGA
CGG-3′), and survivin (FWD: 5′-CTT GGA GGG CTG
CGC CTG CAC CC-3′, RV: 5′-CTG GCT CCC AGC CTT
CCA GCT CCT TG-3′).

Cell surface protein biotinylation assays
For cell surface protein biotinylation assays, cells
were grown to 80% to 90% confluence in 100-mm dishes,
washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and incubated for 15 min
in ice-cold PBS. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated
by incubating cells in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml of EZLinkNHS-SS-Biotin (Thermo Scientific) for 30 minutes
at 4°C. Biotinylated cells were washed twice with PBS
and lysed. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated from
the lysates using streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads
(Invitrogen) and analyzed by western blotting with the
indicated antibodies. To control for non-specific labeling
of intracellular proteins, biotinylated cells were washed
with 100 mM glutathione (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 minutes
at 4°C.

Cell fractionation
For cell fractionation assays, cells were seeded at
a density of 1 × 106 cells in 100-mm dishes. Cells were
harvested in cytoplasmic extraction buffer [10 mM
HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM
EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5 mM PMSF]
and incubated for 15 min on ice. The cells were then
agitated for 10 min at 4°C, and NP-40 was added to a
final concentration of 0.5%. The resultant lysates were
clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The
supernatants were collected as the cytosolic fractions. The
nuclear pellets were washed three times with cold PBS and
resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer [20 mM HEPES
(pH 7.9), 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA,
1mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF], after which the homogenates
were incubated for 15 min on ice. The nuclear extracts
were agitated for 10 min at 4°C and then centrifuged
at 13,000 rpm at 4°C. The resulting supernatants were
collected as the nuclear fraction.

Tumor tissue collection
The expression levels of galectin-1 and survivin
were evaluated in 24 primary invasive breast cancer tissue
samples from different individuals. Tissue specimens
were randomly selected from the tissue archives of the
Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University. All
tumors had been excised between 2004 and 2006, and
were histopathologically confirmed. Informed consent
was obtained from all participants before operation, and
the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of Seoul National University Hospital (H-0512-502-163).

Purification of recombinant human galectin-1

Statistical analyses

Using the galectin-1-WT construct as a backbone, a
plasmid driving the expression of a GST-galectin-1 fusion
protein (pGEX-4T-3-galectin-1) was produced using the
following primers: FWD, 5′-CTA GGA TCC ATG GCT
TGT GGT CTG GTC GC-3′; RV, 5′-CGC GTC GAC GTC
AAA GGC CAC ACA TTT G-3′. E. coli BL21 (DE3)
cells were then transformed with the resulting construct.
Growing E. coli cells were then induced to produce
protein by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl 1-thio-β-Dgalactopyranoside and the cells were harvested after 4 h
of growth and lysed by sonication. Clarified supernatants
were loaded onto a glutathione Sepharose 4B column (GE

All experiments were performed in triplicate.
