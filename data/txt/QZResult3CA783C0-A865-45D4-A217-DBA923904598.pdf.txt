p66Shc Is Indispensable for Phenethyl Isothiocyanate–
Induced Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer Cells
Dong Xiao and Shivendra V. Singh

Abstract
Naturally occurring phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) selectively inhibits growth of cancer cells by causing
apoptosis, but the mechanism of cell death induction is not fully understood. We now show, for the first time,
that growth factor adapter protein p66Shc is indispensable for PEITC-induced apoptosis. Mouse embryonic
fibroblasts derived from p66Shc knockout mice were significantly more resistant to PEITC-mediated growth
inhibition, cytoplasmic histone-associated apoptotic DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation compared
with wild-type fibroblasts. The PEITC treatment resulted in induction as well as increased Ser36 phosphorylation of p66Shc in PC-3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Knockdown of p66Shc protein conferred significant protection against PEITC-mediated cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation as well as
production of reactive oxygen species in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells. The PEITC-treated PC-3 and LNCaP cells
exhibited increased binding of p66Shc with prolyl isomerase Pin1, a protein implicated in translocation of
p66Shc to mitochondria. Consistent with these results, treatment of PC-3 cells with PEITC resulted in translocation of p66Shc to the mitochondria as judged by immunoblotting using cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions and immunofluorescence microscopy. Growth suppression and apoptosis induction in tumor xenografts
in vivo by oral administration of PEITC to the PC-3 tumor-bearing male athymic mice were accompanied by
statistically significant increase in the level of Ser36-phosphorylated p66Shc. Collectively, these results provide
novel insight into the critical role of p66Shc in regulation of PEITC-induced apoptotic cell death in human
prostate cancer cells. Cancer Res; 70(8); 3150–8. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Despite continuous evolution of targeted therapies and
significantly improved screening efforts (e.g., digital rectal
examination and screening for prostate-specific antigen),
prostate cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related
deaths among men in the United States (1). Because many
of the risk factors associated with prostate cancer development (e.g., genetic predisposition and age) are not modifiable,
novel agents to prevent and treat this devastating disease are
highly attractive to reduce disease-related cost, morbidity, and
mortality for a large segment of population. Natural products
have received increasing attention in recent years for discovery of novel cancer chemopreventive/therapeutic agents (2).
Epidemiologic studies have suggested that dietary intake
of cruciferous vegetables may lower the risk of different

malignancies, including cancer of the prostate (3–5). For example, a multicenter case-control study of African-American,
white, Japanese, and Chinese men (n = 1,619) with histologically
confirmed prostate cancer and matched controls (n = 1,618;
matched by ethnicity, age, and region of residence) showed
an inverse association between intake of cruciferous vegetables and the risk of prostate cancer (4).
Anticarcinogenic effect of cruciferous vegetables is credited to naturally occurring chemicals with an ITC moiety
(—N=C=S), which are produced by myrosinase-mediated hydrolysis of corresponding glucosinolates (6, 7). Phenethyl ITC
(PEITC) is one such naturally occurring ITC compound that
has garnered tremendous research interest for a variety of
reasons, including anticancer effect and favorable safety profile
(8–13). For example, PEITC is a potent inhibitor of pulmonary
tumorigenesis in rats induced by tobacco-specific carcinogen
4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (8, 9). The
PEITC administration was shown to offer significant protection against diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular
adenoma development in mice (10). The PEITC-mediated prevention of N-nitrosobenzylmethylamine–induced esophageal
cancer in rats was associated with modulation of carcinogeninduced gene expression (11, 12).
More recent studies, including those from our laboratory,
have revealed that PEITC has the ability to suppress growth
of cancer cells in culture and in vivo (14–19). Mechanism behind anticancer effect of PEITC is not fully understood, but
known cellular responses to this promising agent include

p66Shc Is Essential for PEITC-Induced Apoptosis

c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase–mediated and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase–mediated apoptosis induction (14,
15), G 2 -M–phase cell cycle arrest (16), suppression of
NF-κB–regulated gene expression (17), inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro and ex vivo (20), and Atg5-mediated autophagy
(21). We have also shown previously that oral administration
of PEITC significantly retards growth of PC-3 human prostate
cancer cells s.c. implanted in male athymic mice without
causing weight loss or any other side effects (19, 21).
Previous studies have indicated that the PEITC-mediated
proapoptotic signal transduction is intimately linked to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS; refs. 19, 22). However,
the molecular circuitry of PEITC-mediated ROS production
and apoptotic cell death is still not fully understood. We
now show, for the first time, that growth factor adapter protein p66Shc is essential for PEITC-induced ROS production as
well as apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. PEITC (purity, >99%) was purchased from SigmaAldrich. Reagents for cell culture were purchased from
Life Technologies. Hydroethidine and 5-(and-6)-carboxy2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester
(CDCFDA) were purchased from Molecular Probes. The
p66Shc-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) was procured
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and a nonspecific control
siRNA was from Qiagen. A kit for quantitation of cytoplasmic
histone-associated DNA fragmentation was from Roche Diagnostics. Antibodies against p66Shc, phospho-(Ser36)-p66Shc,
and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; an antibody against prolyl isomerase (Pin1)
was from Cell Signaling Technology; anti–cytochrome c oxidase
IV (COXIV) antibody was from Molecular Probes; and an antibody against actin was from Oncogene Research Products.
Caspase-3 activation was measured by flow cytometry using a
kit from Cell Signaling Technology. Protein kinase Cβ (PKCβ)–
selective inhibitor [3-(1-(3-imidazol-1-ylpropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl)4-anilino-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione; hereafter abbreviated as
PKCβ-I] was purchased from EMD Biosciences.
Cell lines and cell culture. The PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
and validated by analysis of known markers (e.g., expression
of p53 and androgen responsiveness). Monolayer cultures of
PC-3 (an androgen-independent cell line lacking functional
p53) and LNCaP cells [an androgen-responsive cell line with
wild-type (WT) p53] were maintained as described by us previously (15, 23). Immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEF) derived from WT and p66Shc−/− mice were generously
provided by Drs. T. Finkel and S. Nemoto (NIH, Bethesda,
MD) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, 0.1 μmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics.
Western blotting. Stock solution of PEITC was prepared in
DMSO and diluted with complete medium immediately before use. An equal volume of DMSO (final concentration,
<0.1%) was added to the controls. Cell lysates were prepared
as previously described by us (15, 24). Cytosolic and mito-

www.aacrjournals.org

chondrial fractions from DMSO-treated control and PEITCtreated cells were prepared using a kit from BioVision according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Immunoblotting
was performed essentially as described by us previously (24).
Cell viability assay and measurement of apoptosis. The
effect of PEITC treatment on cell viability was determined by
trypan blue dye exclusion assay as described by us previously
(25). Apoptosis induction by PEITC was assessed by analysis
of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation using
a kit from Roche Diagnostics. Activation of caspase-3 was
determined by flow cytometry using a kit from Cell Signaling
Technology as recommended by the supplier.
RNA interference of p66Shc. The PC-3 or LNCaP cells (1 ×
5
10 ) were seeded in six-well plates and allowed to attach by
overnight incubation. The cells were transfected with
200 nmol/L of a control nonspecific siRNA or p66Shc-targeted
siRNA using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours
after transfection, the cells were treated with DMSO (control)
or specified concentration of PEITC for desired time period.
The cells were collected, washed with PBS, and processed for
immunoblotting or analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated
DNA fragmentation and ROS production as described previously (25, 26).
Analysis of interaction between p66 Shc and Pin1 or
HSP70. Aliquots containing 300 μg of total lysate protein
or mitochondria-enriched fractions from PC-3 or LNCaP cells
treated with DMSO (control) or 5 μmol/L PEITC (8-h treatment) were incubated overnight at 4°C with 6 μg of antip66Shc antibody. Protein G–agarose beads (50 μL; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) were then added to each sample, and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer
and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-Pin1 antibody (total lysate) or anti-HSP70 antibody
(mitochondria-enriched fraction).
Immunocytochemical analysis for mitochondrial
localization of p66Shc. The PC-3 cells (1 × 105) were plated
on coverslips and treated with 5 μmol/L PEITC or DMSO
(control) for 8 h. The cells were then treated with 200 nmol/L
MitoTracker Red at 37°C for 30 min to stain mitochondria.
After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 10 min. The cells were washed with PBS,
blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, and
incubated with anti-p66Shc antibody overnight at 4°C. The cells
were then washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor
488–conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for
1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were washed
with PBS and treated with 10 ng/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole for 5 min at room temperature to stain nucleus.
The cells were washed twice with PBS and examined under a
Leica fluorescence microscope at ×1,000 magnification.
Immunohistochemical analyses for total and phosphorylated p66Shc and Pin1 in PC-3 tumor xenografts. We used
tumor tissues from a previously published xenograft study
(21) to determine in vivo effect of PEITC administration on
expression of total and Ser36-phosphorylated p66Shc and Pin1.
Tumor tissues from the control and PEITC-treated mice

were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4- to 5-μm thickness.
Immunohistochemistry was performed as described by us
previously (27). At least three nonoverlapping images from
each tissue section were captured and analyzed using
Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics).
Statistical analysis. Each experiment was repeated at
least twice to ensure reproducibility of the results. Paired
t test or one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple
comparison test was used to determine significance of difference in measured variables between groups. Difference was
considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results
p66Shc deficiency conferred resistance toward PEITCinduced apoptosis. We have shown previously that the
PEITC-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cell line is intimately linked
to the production of ROS (19). Because electron transfer between cytochrome c and p66Shc, which is a splice variant of
cytoplasmic adapter proteins p52Shc/p46Shc that are involved
in signal transduction from activated tyrosine kinases to Ras
(28), has been shown to cause ROS-dependent mitochondrial
apoptosis (29), we raised the question of whether PEITCinduced apoptosis was mediated by the p66Shc protein. Initially,
we used MEFs derived from WT (p66-WT) and p66Shc knockout (p66-KO) mice to test possible involvement of this protein
in PEITC-induced apoptosis. Immunoblotting confirmed absence of the p66Shc isoform (but not p52Shc or p46Shc) in p66KO MEFs (Fig. 1A). Exposure of MEFs derived from p66-WT
mice to PEITC resulted in a concentration-dependent and statistically significant decrease in cell viability (Fig. 1B). The
MEFs derived from the p66-KO mice were statistically significantly more resistant to PEITC-mediated growth retardation

compared with p66-WT cells (Fig. 1B). The PEITC-mediated
suppression of p66-WT MEF viability correlated with apoptosis induction as evidenced by cytoplasmic histone-associated
DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1C) and caspase-3 activation
(Fig. 1D). In agreement with cell viability data (Fig. 1B), the
p66-KO MEFs were protected against PEITC-mediated cytoplasmic histone-associated apoptotic DNA fragmentation
(Fig. 1C) as well as caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1D) in comparison with p66-WT MEFs.
We raised a question of whether p66Shc dependence of
PEITC-induced apoptosis was unique to this compound.
We addressed this question using benzyl ITC, a structural analogue of PEITC. The MEFs derived from p66-KO mice were
significantly more resistant to benzyl ITC-mediated growth
inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S1A) as well as cytoplasmic
histone-associated DNA fragmentation (Supplementary Fig.
S1B) compared with p66-WT MEFs. These results indicated
that involvement of p66Shc in apoptosis regulation is not
unique to the PEITC.
PEITC-induced apoptosis and ROS production were
inhibited by RNA interference of p66Shc. Next, we determined
the effect of PEITC treatment (5 μmol/L, 24 hours) on levels
of total and Ser36-phosphorylated p66Shc because oxidative
stress–induced Ser36 phosphorylation of p66Shc is critical
for its translocation to mitochondria after recognition by
Pin1 (30). The PEITC-treated PC-3 cells exhibited a modest
yet marked increase in protein level of total p66Shc, which
was accompanied by ∼2.5-fold increase in level of Ser36phosphorylated p66Shc over DMSO-treated control (Fig. 2A).
Next, we used siRNA technology to directly test contribution
of p66Shc in regulation of PEITC-induced apoptosis. As can be
seen in Fig. 2B, the level of p66Shc protein was decreased by
∼60% by transient transfection of PC-3 cells with p66Shctargeted siRNA compared with cells transfected with a

control nonspecific siRNA. Similar to untransfected cells
(Fig. 2A), the PEITC treatment (5 μmol/L, 24 hours) caused
an increase in levels of total and Ser36-phosphorylated p66Shc
in comparison with DMSO-treated control in PC-3 cells
transfected with the nonspecific siRNA. The PEITC-mediated
induction as well as Ser36 hyperphosphorylation of p66Shc
were markedly suppressed in PC-3 cells transfected with
the p66Shc-targeted siRNA (Fig. 2B). Twenty-four–hour exposure of nonspecific control siRNA–transfected PC-3 cells to
5 μmol/L PEITC resulted in ∼2.8-fold increase in cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation compared with
DMSO-treated control (Fig. 2C). The p66Shc-depleted cells
were nearly completely resistant to PEITC-induced apoptotic
DNA fragmentation compared with cells transfected with
control siRNA (Fig. 2C). Because PEITC-mediated apoptosis
correlates with ROS production (19, 22), we also determined
ROS generation by PEITC treatment (5 μmol/L, 4-hour
treatment) in cells transfected with control siRNA and
p66Shc-targeted siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2D, the PEITCmediated oxidation of CDCFDA (a measure of peroxide
production) over DMSO-treated control was observed in
nonspecific siRNA-transfected PC-3 cells but not in the
p66Shc-depleted cells.

We raised the question of whether involvement of p66Shc
protein in regulation of PEITC-induced apoptosis was unique
to the PC-3 cell line or influenced by androgen responsiveness
and p53 status. We addressed these questions using LNCaP
cell line. The p53 connection was particularly intriguing because p66Shc protein is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53 (31). Similar to PC-3 cells, the PEITC treatment
(5 μmol/L, 24 hours) resulted in induction as well as increased
Ser36 phosphorylation of p66Shc in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3A). Moreover, a 50% depletion of p66Shc protein level by transient transfection of LNCaP cells with the p66Shc-targeted siRNA (Fig. 3B)
caused statistically significant protection against PEITCinduced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 3C) as well as peroxide
production (Fig. 3D) compared with cells transfected with
nonspecific siRNA. Collectively, these results indicated that
the p66Shc protein was essential for apoptosis resulting from
PEITC treatment in prostate cancer cells irrespective of their
androgen responsiveness or the p53 status. Based on these
results, we also conclude that the p66Shc protein functions upstream of ROS production in the molecular circuitry of PEITCinduced apoptosis.
PEITC-induced apoptosis was inhibited by pharmacologic
inhibition of PKCβ. We used a cell-permeable pharmacologic

inhibitor of PKCβ to determine its role in PEITC-mediated
increase in Ser36 phosphorylation of p66Shc. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A, increased Ser36 phosphorylation of p66Shc
resulting from PEITC exposure (5 μmol/L, 24 hours) was significantly inhibited in the presence of PKCβ-I in PC-3 cells.
Moreover, cotreatment of PC-3 cells with PKCβ-I conferred
statistically significant protection against PEITC-induced cytoplasmic histone-associated apoptotic DNA fragmentation
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). These results indicated that the
PEITC-mediated Ser36 hyperphosphorylation of p66Shc was
mediated by PKCβ.
PEITC treatment promoted mitochondrial translocation
of p66Shc. Prolyl isomerase Pin1 has been shown to play an
important role in mitochondrial translocation of p66Shc (30).
Initially, we determined the effect of PEITC treatment on
protein level of Pin1 by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). The protein level of Pin1 was decreased by about 30% to 80% by a
24-hour treatment of PC-3 and LNCaP cells with 2.5 and
5 μmol/L PEITC (Fig. 4A). Despite reduction in Pin1 protein
level, the PEITC treatment (5 μmol/L, 8 hours) resulted in
increased binding of p66Shc protein with Pin1 in both cell
lines as revealed by immunoprecipitation using anti-p66Shc
antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-Pin1 antibody (Fig. 4B). The blot was also probed with anti-p66Shc
antibody to ensure equal immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4B).
Next, we proceeded to test whether PEITC treatment
caused mitochondrial translocation of p66Shc by immunoblotting using isolated cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions
from PC-3 cells. As can be seen in Fig. 4C, the p66Shc protein

was detectable in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions
of DMSO-treated control PC-3 cells. However, the mitochondrial level of p66Shc protein was increased by ∼2.8-fold on
8-hour treatment of PC-3 cells with 5 μmol/L PEITC compared with DMSO-treated control (Fig. 4C, top). Probing of
the blot with anti-COXIV antibody confirmed purity of the
mitochondrial fraction. The PEITC-mediated translocation
of p66Shc to the mitochondria was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4C, bottom). The intensity of the
p66 Shc -associated green fluorescence was very weak in
DMSO-treated control PC-3 cells. On the other hand, 8-hour
treatment of PC-3 cells with 2.5 μmol/L PEITC resulted in
marked increase in green fluorescence due to induction of
the p66Shc protein (Fig. 4C), which was consistent with the
immunoblotting data shown in Fig. 2A. Moreover, the
PEITC-treated PC-3 cells exhibited increased mitochondrial
localization of p66 Shc as evidenced by appearance of
yellow-orange color due to the merging of MitoTrackerassociated red fluorescence and p66Shc-associated green fluorescence (Fig. 4C, bottom). Collectively, these results indicated
that PEITC treatment caused increased interaction of
p66Shc with Pin1 and resulted in mitochondrial translocation
of p66Shc.
PEITC treatment inhibited interaction between p66Shc
and mitochondrial HSP70. Previous studies have shown
that mitochondrial p66Shc complexes with HSP70, and disruption of this interaction is necessary for regulation of
transmembrane potential (32). We therefore tested the
possibility whether PEITC treatment affected interaction

between p66Shc and HSP70. As can be seen in Fig. 4D, the
p66Shc-HSP70 complex was detectable in DMSO-treated
control PC-3 cells as evidenced by immunoprecipitation
using anti-p66Shc antibody followed by immunoblotting
with the anti-HSP70 antibody (Fig. 4D). The level of
p66Shc-HSP70 complex was decreased by ∼80% on 8-hour
treatment of PC-3 cells with 5 μmol/L PEITC (Fig. 4D).
These results showed that PEITC treatment disrupted interaction between p66Shc and HSP70.
Oral administration of PEITC increased Ser36 phosphorylation of p66Shc in PC-3 xenografts. We have shown previously that oral administration of PEITC inhibits growth
of PC-3 cells implanted in male athymic mice in association
with apoptosis induction (21). The average tumor volume on
the day of sacrifice (38 days after tumor cell implantation) in
mice gavaged with 9 μmol PEITC was lower by ∼48% compared with the vehicle-treated control mice (21). Fraction of
apoptotic bodies was ∼4-fold higher in tumor sections from
PEITC-treated mice compared with control tumors (21). In
the present study, we used tumor sections from these mice

www.aacrjournals.org

to determine in vivo significance of our cellular findings. As
shown in Fig. 5A, the tumor sections from PEITC-treated
mice exhibited statistically significant increase in the level
of Ser36-phosphorylated p66Shc compared with control tumor
sections, which was consistent with data in cultured PC-3
cells (Fig. 2A). Although PEITC treatment resulted in a modest increase in the level of total p66Shc (Fig. 5B), the difference did not reach statistical significance. In agreement with
cellular data (Fig. 4A), the level of Pin1 protein was ∼50%
lower (P < 0.05, compared with control by paired t test) in
the tumor sections from PEITC-treated mice compared with

oral administration of PEITC resulted in increased Ser36
phosphorylation of p66 Shc as well as downregulation of

Discussion
Previous studies have shown that cells lacking p66Shc protein resist oxidation of ROS-sensitive chemical probes and

display reduced accumulation of endogenous oxidative stress
marker 8-oxo-guanosine (31, 33). Furthermore, the p66Shc KO
mice exhibit diminished levels of systemic (isoprostane) as
well as intracellular (8-oxo-guanosine) markers of oxidative
stress (31, 33, 34). Genetic deletion of p66Shc in cells also
confers protection against apoptosis induced by UV radiation, staurosporine, and growth factor deprivation (32, 35, 36).
Moreover, the p66Shc KO mice are resistant to apoptosis induction by paraquat and ischemia (34, 35, 37). Because proapoptotic effect of PEITC in cancer cells is linked to ROS production
(19, 22), we raised the question of whether molecular circuitry
of PEITC-induced apoptosis was dependent on p66Shc. Results
presented herein indicate that the p66Shc protein is indeed
essential for PEITC-induced apoptosis. This conclusion is substantiated by the observed resistance of immortalized MEFs
derived from p66Shc−/− mice to growth suppression and apoptosis induction by PEITC compared with WT fibroblasts.
Moreover, knockdown of p66Shc protein by RNA interference
significantly inhibits PEITC-induced apoptosis in PC-3 and
LNCaP cells. Another important conclusion from the present
study is that the p66Shc protein functions upstream of ROS production in execution of PEITC-induced apoptosis. Previous
studies have shown that electron transfer between cytochrome c and p66Shc leads to production of hydrogen peroxide
(29). It is probable that PEITC treatment promotes p66Shcmediated oxidation of reduced cytochrome c to trigger ROS
production in our model. Further work is needed to directly
test this possibility.
The PC-3 and LNCaP cells were used in the present study
not only to authenticate generality of the p66Shc dependence
of PEITC-induced apoptosis but also to determine possible

influence of p53 in this response. The p53 status is known
to influence stability of the p66Shc protein in response to
treatment with UV and hydrogen peroxide (31). The
PEITC-mediated induction of p66Shc protein expression was
relatively more pronounced in the LNCaP cell line with intact
p53 compared with PC-3 cells lacking functional p53. Because PEITC treatment results in modest induction of
p66Shc protein in the PC-3 cell line, we can conclude that
the induction of p66Shc protein in our model is not solely dependent on the p53 status. The LNCaP cell line is relatively
more sensitive to PEITC-mediated apoptotic DNA fragmentation compared with PC-3 cells. On the other hand, the PC-3
cells express ∼4-fold higher level of p66Shc protein compared
with LNCaP C-33 cells (38). A role for p66Shc and ROS in
androgen-induced prostate cancer cell proliferation has also
been documented by the same group of investigators (39).
Because the p66Shc protein promotes PEITC-induced apoptosis in our model, we conclude that differential sensitivity of
PC-3 and LNCaP cells to proapoptotic effect of PEITC per se
is not related to difference in p66Shc protein level.
PKCβ-mediated Ser36 phosphorylation of p66Shc has been
documented to promote its mitochondrial accumulation in a
pro-oxidant environment, although this protein lacks conventional mitochondria-targeting sequence (30). Instead, the
oxidative stress–induced (e.g., H2O2) mitochondrial enrichment of p66Shc is facilitated by interaction with peptidylprolyl isomerase Pin1 (30). The precise mechanism to explain
Pin1-dependent mitochondrial import of p66Shc is still not
clear. The present study reveals that PEITC treatment not
only intensifies Ser36 phosphorylation of p66Shc in prostate
cancer cells but also increases its binding with Pin1

been shown to facilitate cytokine-induced survival of eosinophils by suppressing Bax activation (40). It is plausible that
downregulation of Pin1 contributes to Bax activation in
PEITC-induced apoptosis. This possibility is likely because cell
death resulting from PEITC exposure is inhibited in cells lacking Bax (18).
In vivo validation of the cellular mechanistic observations
is critical for identification of biomarker(s) of response potentially useful in future clinical trials. Biomarker discovery
is especially critical because cancer incidence is too rigorous
of an end point for chemoprevention trials. We found that
oral administration of PEITC to the PC-3 xenograft-bearing
male athymic mice not only retards tumor growth in association with apoptosis induction (21) but also increases Ser36
phosphorylation of p66Shc and downregulates Pin1 protein
level (present study). These observations suggest that Ser36phosphorylated p66Shc and Pin1 protein level may be viable
biomarkers of PEITC response.
In conclusion, as summarized in Fig. 6, the results presented herein indicate that PEITC treatment enhances
PKCβ-mediated Ser36 phosphorylation of p66Shc, which increases its binding with Pin1. The binding of p66Shc with
Pin1 promotes translocation of p66Shc to the mitochondria.
The p66Shc protein localized to the mitochondria is released
from HSP70 and causes ROS production, leading to caspase-3
activation and apoptotic cell death.
