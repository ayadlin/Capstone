Activation Status of the Pregnane X Receptor
Inﬂuences Vemurafenib Availability in
Humanized Mouse Models

Abstract
Vemurafenib is a revolutionary treatment for melanoma,
but the magnitude of therapeutic response is highly variable,
and the rapid acquisition of resistance is frequent. Here, we
examine how vemurafenib disposition, particularly through
cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation pathways, could potentially inﬂuence these outcomes using a panel of knockout and
transgenic humanized mouse models. We identiﬁed CYP3A4
as the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of vemurafenib in in vitro assays with human liver microsomes. However, mice expressing human CYP3A4 did not process vemurafenib to a greater extent than CYP3A4-null animals, suggesting that other pregnane X receptor (PXR)–regulated pathways
may contribute more signiﬁcantly to vemurafenib metabolism

in vivo. Activation of PXR, but not of the closely related
constitutive androstane receptor, profoundly reduced circulating levels of vemurafenib in humanized mice. This effect
was independent of CYP3A4 and was negated by cotreatment
with the drug efﬂux transporter inhibitor elacridar. Finally,
vemurafenib strongly induced PXR activity in vitro, but only
weakly induced PXR in vivo. Taken together, our ﬁndings
demonstrate that vemurafenib is unlikely to exhibit a clinically
signiﬁcant interaction with CYP3A4, but that modulation of
bioavailability through PXR-mediated regulation of drug transporters (e.g., by other drugs) has the potential to markedly
inﬂuence systemic exposure and thereby therapeutic outcomes.

Introduction

problem. The magnitude of initial response to vemurafenib is
highly variable (5–7). Although approximately half of patients
meet the RECIST threshold for an objective response after 14 weeks
of therapy, the remainder occupy a spectrum from nonobjective
response to disease progression, suggestive of varying degrees of
innate resistance (7). Moreover, the median duration of response is
only 6.7 months due to the acquisition of resistance (6). A large
number of potential mechanisms of both innate and acquired
resistance have been identiﬁed, most of which invoke the plasticity
of signaling networks within the tumor to circumvent blockade to
BRAFV600E function (9, 10). The majority of these studies have been
conducted in cultured cell lines and tumor biopsy samples. There
has been comparatively little effort to investigate whether the high
interindividual variability in drug exposure at steady state, with
coefﬁcients of variation of both Cmax and AUC of 30% to 40%, is a
determinant of therapeutic outcome and/or resistance, despite the
trends toward an exposure–response relationship in both overall
and progression-free survival identiﬁed by population pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses (11–13), is a determinant of therapeutic
outcome and/or resistance, with the notable exception of a recent
study in which low circulating vemurafenib concentrations were
associated with disease progression (14).
During preclinical development, vemurafenib was found to be
a substrate and possible inducer of CYP3A4, which was the major
enzyme involved in its metabolism in vitro (11, 12, 15). Moreover,
CYP3A4-generated monohydroxy-vemurafenib (OH-vemurafenib) was detected in a mass balance analysis in patients at steady
state (11, 12, 15). In this latter study, OH-vemurafenib levels were
low compared with the parental compound but, as the absolute
bioavailability of vemurafenib is unknown, it is impossible to
draw any conclusions as to the relative contribution of metabolism in general, and CYP3A4 in particular, to elimination of the

The BRAF gene is mutated in approximately 50% of all malignant melanomas (1). In three quarters of these cases, mutation
results in a valine to glutamic acid substitution at codon 600
(V600E), conferring an enhancement of kinase activity that promotes cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis (1–4). Vemurafenib (RG7204, PLX4032) was the ﬁrst therapeutic agent clinically
approved for the treatment of BRAFV600E-positive malignant
melanoma. A highly speciﬁc inhibitor of the mutant kinase,
vemurafenib elicits an objective tumor response in 48% of all
patients with BRAFV600E-positive metastatic melanoma when
given as a single agent, with increases in both overall and progression-free survival when compared with conventional chemotherapy with dacarbazine (5–7).
Vemurafenib is both a revolutionary treatment for melanoma
and, along with the companion diagnostic assay (8), a widely cited
example of the potential for therapeutic stratiﬁcation based on
mutational analysis. However, as with many recently developed
clinically approved kinase inhibitors, drug resistance is a major

drug. Therefore, if only a small percentage of vemurafenib reaches
the systemic circulation, metabolism may yet constitute a major
route of elimination and an important determinant of drug
exposure. In addition to these metabolic considerations, postapproval studies using knockout mouse lines have identiﬁed
phase III drug efﬂux transporters as critical determinants of
vemurafenib bioavailability (16, 17).
CYP3A4 shows high inter- and intraindividual variation in expression, with differences in excess of 100-fold (18). The primary mode
of CYP3A4 regulation is transcriptional, with activation of two
nuclear hormone receptors in particular, pregnane X receptor (PXR)
and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), by exogenous ligands,
endogenous ligands, or upstream signaling pathways known to
increase its levels (19). In the present study, we have assessed the
role of these metabolic factors in mediating vemurafenib disposition
in both in vitro assays and in humanized mouse models in vivo. We
have compared the relative contributions of metabolic and efﬂux
pathways with vemurafenib PK, and have investigated the potential
of vemurafenib to inﬂuence its own disposition.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents
Crystalline vemurafenib and PLX4720 were purchased from
Selleck chemicals. Microprecipitated bulk powder (MBP) vemurafenib was obtained through the Genentech Research Projects and
Reagents Program (Genentech). Klucel LF Pharm was obtained
from Ashland Inc. Elacridar hydrochloride was purchased from
Sequoia Research Products. NADPH was purchased from Melford
laboratories (Ipswich, UK). Protease inhibitors (cOmplete
ULTRA, EDTA-free) were obtained from Roche. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Animal lines and husbandry
The generation and characterization of Cyp3aKO/Cyp3a13þ/þ,
huCYP3A4/3A7, huPXR/huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7, and huPXR/
huCAR mice have been described previously (20, 21). Brieﬂy,
the Cyp3aKO/Cyp3a13þ/þ line bears a deletion of seven of the
eight murine Cyp3a genes and exhibits low and uninducible
oxidative metabolism of the CYP3A4 probe substrates triazolam,
dibenzylﬂuorescein, and midazolam (20). The huCYP3A4/3A7
line carries a large genomic insertion of human CYP3A4 and
CYP3A7 in place of the Cyp3a locus (20). In this line, CYP3A4 is
maintained at a low basal level, but can be upregulated following
ligand-activated nuclear translocation of the transcription factor,
Pxr, most effectively with a synthetic glucocorticoid, 5-pregnenolone-3b-ol-20-one-16a-carbonitrile (PCN; ref. 20). The huPXR/
huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7 line has been similarly humanized for
CYP3A4/3A7, with additional humanizations for Pxr/PXR and
Car/CAR (20). In this line, CYP3A4 can be induced by rifampicin
(RIF), a ligand activator of human PXR (20). The huPXR/huCAR
line carries the human transcription factors, but retains the murine
Cyp3a cluster (21). All animals were maintained under standard
animal house conditions, with free access to food (RM1 diet,
Special Diet Services) and water, and a 12-hour light/12-hour dark
cycle. All animal work was carried in accordance with the Animal
Scientiﬁc Procedures Act (1986) and after local ethical review.
Subcellular fractionation
Livers were excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for
storage at 80 C until processing. Brieﬂy, samples were thawed

4574 Cancer Res; 75(21) November 1, 2015

by the addition of 3 volumes of KCl buffer (1.15% w/v potassium
chloride, 10 mmol/L potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) and homogenized by rotor-stator. Debris was pelleted by centrifugation
(11,000  g at 4 C for 15 minutes) and the supernatant withdrawn for ultracentrifugation (100,000  g at 4 C for 60 minutes). After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was retained and the pellet (microsomal fraction) was
resuspended in KCl buffer containing 0.25 mol/L sucrose. Protein
content of microsomal and cytosolic fractions was quantiﬁed by
Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).
In vitro studies
All in vitro analyses were carried out with crystalline vemurafenib in 50 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.4 containing 30 mmol/L
MgCl2. Incubations were initiated ay the addition of NADPH to
a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mmol/L and terminated by the addition
of 1x volume of ice cold acetonitrile. Microsomal stability assays
were performed in triplicate with 1 mmol/L compound and 0.2
mg/mL pooled human liver microsomes (HLM, 150 donors; Life
Technologies) with or without NADPH for a period of up to 50
minutes. HLM and mouse liver microsome (MLM, pooled from 3
wild-type mice) incubations for formation of the OH-vemurafenib metabolite contained 0.4 mg/mL microsomal protein and 60
mmol/L vemurafenib. Incubations with HLM from individual
donors for Spearman's rank correlation were performed with
50 mmol/L vemurafenib and 0.1 mg/mL protein for 6 minutes.
Initial incubations with recombinant P450s were carried out with
60 mmol/L compound and 400 pmol/mL enzyme for 15 minutes.
Assays to determine the apparent kinetic parameters of OHvemurafenib formation in HLM and MLM were performed in
triplicate under conditions of linearity for time and protein: 10
minutes at 0.2 mg/mL for HLM, 15 minutes at 0.4 mg/mL for
MLM, 6 minutes at 160 pmol/mL for recombinant CYP3A4, and 9
minutes at 160 pmol/mL for CYP2C9. For inhibition studies,
pooled HLM were incubated at 0.2 mg/mL with 60 mmol/L
vemurafenib for 10 minutes in the presence of 1 mmol/L ketoconazole, 2 mmol/L sulfaphenazole, or both together. Inhibition of
7-benzyloxy quinolone (BQ) turnover by vemurafenib was measured using a BQ concentration of 30 mmol/L and 0.2 mg/mL
HLM with increasing concentrations of vemurafenib, and the
ﬂuorescent product measured using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL
ﬂuorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
PXR-transactivation assay
Cells stably transfected with the PXR gene and a reporter
construct with luciferase under the control of PXR-responsive
elements of the CYP3A4 promoter (DPX2 cells; Puracyp Inc.)
were treated with a range of concentrations of vemurafenib (0.06,
0.17, 0.51, 1.54, 4.62, 13.89, 41.67, and 125 mmol/L) in triplicate
for 48 hours and assayed for luminescence and ﬂuorescence as per
the manufacturer's instructions. The top two concentrations of
vemurafenib were highly toxic so data from these points were
excluded from the analysis. PXR activation (fold change) was
calculated by dividing luminescence by ﬂuorescence and normalizing to vehicle control.
In vivo studies
All animal work was carried out on 8- to 12-week-old male
mice (except for those shown in Fig. 7, where female mice were
used). PCN was suspended in corn oil at 1 mg/mL for administration by i.p. injection at 10 mg/kg (10 mL/g body weight).

Vemurafenib Pharmacokinetics in Humanized Mice

RIF was administered in the same way at 60 mg/kg. Phenobarbital
(PB) was dissolved in PBS for i.p. administration at 80 mg/kg. For
PK analyses, crystalline vemurafenib was ﬁrst dissolved in DMSO
and then further diluted in a mixture of Polysorbate 80, ethanol,
and water (20:13:67) for immediate administration by oral
gavage at a ﬁnal dose of 50 mg/kg, as described by Durmus and
colleagues (16). The same method was used for administration of
elacridar at 100 mg/kg (16). For sample collection, 10 mL of whole
blood was withdrawn from the tail vein at the indicated time
points. Samples were immediately added to a tube containing
heparin solution (10 mL and 15 IU/mL) and stored at 20 C until
processing. For induction studies, MBP vemurafenib was suspended in water containing 2% Klucel LF Pharm, which had been
adjusted to pH 4.0 by the addition of hydrochloric acid, and
administered twice daily (8 hours apart) by oral gavage, as
described by Yang and colleagues (22).
Sample processing for LC-MS/MS
Water (100 mL) containing 100 mg/mL internal standard
(PLX4720) was added to in vitro and in vivo samples, followed
by 500 mL of diethyl ether (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). This mixture
was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with gentle
mixing. Samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 16,000  g
and the organic solvent phase withdrawn to a fresh tube for drying
under a vacuum (20 minutes at 30 C). The dried extract was
redissolved in 100 mL of acetonitrile (Sigma) at 37 C with agitation for 5 minutes and samples were added to 96-well plates for
LC-MS/MS.
LC-MS/MS
Analysis of in vitro incubation and in vivo blood PK samples was
carried out on a Waters Acquity UPLC and Micromass Quattro
Premier mass spectrometer (both Micromass). LC separation was
performed on a Kinetex 1.7m C19 100A; 50  2.1 mm column
(Phenomenex) at a temperature of 45 C with an injection volume
of 5 mL and ﬂow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Mobile phases were water
containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (A) and acetonitrile containing
0.1% (v/v) formic acid (B). Isocratic elution was carried out at
35%/65% A/B for 1 minute. Multiple reaction monitoring data in
ESI-positive mode were acquired for vemurafenib [490.10 >
255.04, cone voltage (CV) ¼ 65 V, collision energy (CE) ¼ 40
kV), OH-vemurafenib (505.99 > 255.24, CV ¼ 65 V, CE ¼ 40 kV]
and PLX4720 (414.20 >306.97, CV ¼ 60 V, CE ¼ 37 kV). Acquired
data were analyzed in Quanlynx relative to analyte standard
curves spanning the range of concentrations under study.
Data analysis
In vitro data exhibited non-Michaelis–Menten kinetics, and
therefore was ﬁtted with the Hill equation using GraFit version
5 (Erithacus Software). Standard deviations given are from the ﬁt
of the calculated curve. PK parameters of in vivo data were
calculated with a simple non-compartmental model using WinNonLin software, v4.1 (Pharsight) and are shown with SDs.
P values were calculated using an unpaired t test.
Western blotting
Microsomal and cytosolic samples were adjusted to 1 mg/mL in
LDS sample buffer (Life Technologies) for electrophoresis
through 10% acrylamide gels for 1 hour at 150 V, followed by
transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Primary antibodies used

www.aacrjournals.org

for immunoblotting included anti-CYP3A4 (458234; BD Biosciences), Cyp1a, Cyp2b, Cyp2c, Cyp3a/CYP3A, and Por (23, 24).
Anti-GRP78 (ab21685; Abcam) and anti-GAPDH (G9545;
Sigma) were used as loading controls for microsomal and cytosolic fractions, respectively. In blots for Cyp3a/CYP3A and
CYP3A4, pooled HLM material was the same as used in microsomal incubations, whereas individuals with low, medium, and
high expression were taken from the panel of 15 characterized
donors based on testosterone 6b-hydroxylation activity.
mRNA analysis
Total RNA was isolated from snap-frozen small intestinal samples using TRizol (Life Technologies). The purity of this RNA was
increased by processing with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) followed by treatment with RG1 DNase (Promega). Conversion to
cDNA was carried out using the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription
System with random primers (Promega). The relative levels of
mRNA species were determined by TaqMan RT-PCR (Life Technologies) using the following assays: Abcb1a (Mm00440761_m1),
Abcb1b (Mm00440736_m1), Abcg2 (Mm00496364_m1), and
CYP3A4 (Hs00604506_m1). Fold changes were calculated by the
comparative Ct method with 18S rRNA as an endogenous control
(4319413E; Life Technologies).

Results
Vemurafenib is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro
Metabolic stability of vemurafenib was assessed in pooled HLM
(Fig. 1A). At 1 mmol/L, the compound was highly stable in both
the presence and absence of NADPH; however, formation of OHvemurafenib was detectable in the presence of NADPH (Fig. 1B).
Apparent kinetic parameters of OH-vemurafenib formation by
HLM and MLM were found to be sigmoidal, and therefore were
ﬁtted using the Hill equation. The Vmax for HLM was approximately 10-fold higher than that observed in MLM (4879  108 vs.
467  54 peak area/min/mg, respectively) whereas the S50 was
similar (23.2  0.8 vs. 23.8  4.9 mmol/L, respectively, Fig. 1C).
Hill coefﬁcients are detailed in Supplementary Table S1, alongside
parameters calculated using the Michaelis–Menten model. In a
panel of HLM from 15 donors that had been characterized by the
vendor with regard to their activity with probe substrates for
individual CYP isoforms, formation of OH-vemurafenib correlated most strongly with that of 6b-hydroxy-testosterone, the
marker for CYP3A4 (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 1D). There
was also a strong correlation with CYP2A6 activity (Supplementary
Table S2), but this was deemed artefactual as CYP3A4 and CYP2A6
probe activities within the HLM panel correlate (data not shown),
an observation that has previously been made in a separate batch of
samples (23). Indeed, in incubations with recombinant CYP
containing high concentrations of both protein and substrate,
OH-vemurafenib was formed by CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and, to a lesser
extent, by CYP2C8 and CYP1A1, but not by CYP2A6 (Fig. 1E). The
in vitro apparent kinetics of OH-vemurafenib formation by
CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 were, similarly to HLM and MLM, sigmoidal
in nature. CYP3A4 had a 2-fold higher afﬁnity for vemurafenib
(S50: 10.0  0.9 vs. 20.4  1.7 mmol/L) and a 3.4-fold higher Vmax
(11693  471 vs. 3,481  216 peak area/min/nmol) than
CYP2C9. As with the hepatic microsomal preparations, Hill coefﬁcients and Michaelis–Menten analyses for recombinant P450s are
detailed in Supplementary Table S1. In pooled HLM, coincubation
with the CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, signiﬁcantly inhibited

OH-vemurafenib formation (Fig. 1G). The CYP2C9 inhibitor,
sulfaphenazole, effected a partial decrease in OH-vemurafenib
formation. As expected, coincubation with both inhibitors
completely ablated OH-vemurafenib formation. Also in pooled
HLM, vemurafenib inhibited the activity of the CYP3A4 probe drug
substrate BQ with an IC50 value of 14.9 mmol/L (Fig. 1H).
Single-dose vemurafenib is not extensively metabolized by
CYP3A4 in vivo
To study the contribution of CYP3A4 to metabolism of vemurafenib in vivo, Cyp3aKO/Cyp3a13þ/þ and huCYP3A4/3A7 mice
were administered either PCN or vehicle (CO) alone for 3 days
before administration of vemurafenib, as described in Materials

4576 Cancer Res; 75(21) November 1, 2015

and Methods. Twenty-four hours after the third dose of PCN,
CYP3A4 is expressed in the liver of huCYP3A4/3A7 at a level
similar to that observed in pooled HLM (data not shown). As
stated above, Cyp3aKO/Cyp3a13þ/þ mice are essentially null for
Cyp3a/CYP3A activity, both basal and in response to activation of
Pxr. Therefore, any difference in the PK of vemurafenib between
huCYP3A4/3A7 PCN and Cyp3aKO/Cyp3a13þ/þ PCN is attributable to the activity of CYP3A4. Although not statistically signiﬁcant, there was a decrease in both Cmax and AUCall, and an
increase in CL, in the huCYP3A4/3A7 PCN group, relative to the
Cyp3aKO/Cyp3a13þ/þ PCN group (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table
S3). More pronounced, however, were these same changes in the
PCN groups of both genotypes, relative to their respective vehicle
control groups. The fact that PCN treatment enhanced clearance
equally well in Cyp3a null and huCYP3A4/3A7 animals suggests
that PXR-regulated pathways other than CYP3A4 predominate in
the clearance of vemurafenib in vivo. Immediately after the ﬁnal
blood sample collection, livers were harvested and Western blotting carried out to conﬁrm that CYP3A4 had been effectively
induced by PCN in the huCYP3A4/3A7 mice (Fig. 2B). Because of
this harvest occurring 48 hours after the last dose of PCN, CYP3A4
expression was lower than in pooled HLM due to turnover of the
enzyme.
Exposure to vemurafenib is decreased following activation of
Pxr/PXR, but unaffected by activation of CAR
As PCN pretreatment decreased the systemic concentration of
vemurafenib independently of CYP3A4 (Fig. 2A; Supplementary
Table S3), we further investigated the role of nuclear hormone
receptor activity in mediating disposition to vemurafenib. HuPXR/
huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7 mice were pretreated with RIF, a potent
activator of human PXR, and thus inducer of CYP3A4, leading to a
marked reduction in the AUCall of vemurafenib from 432  169 to
121  18 hmg/mL (P ¼ 0.0106, Fig. 3A; Supplementary Table S4).

analysis of Abcb1a, Abcb1b, and Abcg2 mRNA levels in whole small intestine of
huPXR/huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7 mice dosed with vehicle or RIF.

Western blotting conﬁrmed induction of CYP3A4 in the liver and,
due to the high initial magnitude of this induction, CYP3A4 levels
remained several fold higher than pooled HLM (and equivalent to
HLM expressing high CYP3A4) despite 48 hours having elapsed
after administration of the ﬁnal dose of RIF (Fig. 3B). In addition,
we observed a 4.7-fold increase in mRNA for Abcb1a, but no change
for Abcb1b or Abcg2, in the small intestine of huPXR/huCAR/
huCYP3A4/3A7 mice treated with RIF (Fig. 3C). Activation of PXR
in the huPXR/huCAR mouse line led to a similar decrease in AUCall
of vemurafenib from 349  24 to 75  33 hmg/mL (P ¼ 0.0003,
Fig. 3A; Supplementary Table S4).
To determine whether CAR might play a role in modulating
vemurafenib disposition, huPXR/huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7 mice
were dosed for 3 days with PB, a CAR activator (25), before
vemurafenib administration. This had no effect on any of the
kinetic parameters assessed (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S5).
Western blotting of liver samples demonstrated induction of the
well-characterized CAR target protein, Cyp2b10, conﬁrming the
effective activation of CAR by PB (Fig. 4B).
Activation of PXR reduces vemurafenib exposure through
induction of efﬂux transporters
Activation of PXR by RIF in huPXR/huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7
mice decreased the AUCall of vemurafenib (Figs. 3A, 4A,

www.aacrjournals.org

and 5A; Supplementary Tables S3–S5). This decrease was
almost completely ablated by pretreatment of mice, 90 minutes
before administration of vemurafenib, with elacridar, an effective inhibitor of Abcb1 and Abcg2, but not CYP3A4, at the dose
used (100 mg/kg orally, Fig. 5A; refs. 16, 26, 27). Relative to
mice dosed with RIF alone, AUCall of vemurafenib increased
from 90  13 to 330  85 hmg/mL (P ¼ 0.0085) in animals
dosed with RIF followed by elacridar, whereas Cmax increased
from 11.1  1.8 to 21.3  2.2 mg/mL (P ¼ 0.0032; Supplementary Table S6). Moreover, huPXR/huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7
mice, which had been predosed with vehicle (CO) alone, were
subject to a similar magnitude of increase in exposure to
vemurafenib following elacridar pretreatment, with AUCall
increasing from 391  112 to 684  85 hr mg/mL (P ¼
0.0224) and Cmax increasing from 29.1  4.3 to 37.8  3.5
mg/mL (P ¼ 0.0507, Fig. 5A). Again, effective activation of PXR
by RIF was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis of CYP3A4 in
liver samples (Fig. 5B).
Vemurafenib is a strong inducer of PXR in vitro
We tested the capacity of crystalline vemurafenib to activate a
PXR-driven luciferase reporter construct in the DPX2 cell line
(Puracyp Inc.). The reported aqueous solubility of this form is in
the range of 0.01 to 10 mg/mL (approximately 20 to 20 mmol/L) at
physiologic pH (12). An EC50 value of 8.13 mmol/L and an Emax of
8.54-fold (Fig. 6) was determined. The positive control, rifampicin, gave an EC50 value of 1.01 mmol/L and an Emax of 14.10-fold
(data not shown).

Vemurafenib is a revolutionary treatment for advanced melanoma and, along with the companion diagnostic test for BRAF mutation (8), is a successful example of cancer therapy stratiﬁcation based
on molecular-level information. As with other oncogenic kinases,
however, clinical response to inhibition of BRAFV600 is highly
variable, and the acquisition of resistance in patients initially
responsive to therapy is usually rapid (5–7). A wide variety of
mechanisms of innate and acquired resistance have been identiﬁed,
most of which are a function of the redundancy of the pro-proliferative signaling cascade being targeted (9, 10, 28). Data generated
during the preclinical development of vemurafenib suggested several points of interaction with proteins involved in xenobiotic
metabolism. These have the capacity to alter PK parameters, and
hence the therapeutic effectiveness of this agent (11, 12).
In agreement with the preclinical data (11, 12), we found that
CYP3A4 was the major CYP isoform involved in vemurafenib
metabolism in vitro, but that the rate of metabolism was low. We

Vemurafenib Pharmacokinetics in Humanized Mice

also found that vemurafenib has the capacity to inhibit CYP3A4,
with an IC50 value for BQ activity of 14.9 mmol/L. In addition, and
in conﬂict with the manufacturer's ﬁndings (11, 12), we identiﬁed
a minor role of CYP2C9 in generating OH-vemurafenib,
evidenced by a small but statistically signiﬁcant decrease in
OH-vemurafenib in pooled HLM coincubated with the 2C9speciﬁc inhibitor, sulfaphenazole.
In a previous study, mass balance analysis in 7 patients at steady
state found that, in serum samples withdrawn up to 48 hours after
administration of a radiolabeled dose of vemurafenib, 95% of
recovered radioactivity was in the parental form (11, 12, 15).
There was an increase in (the CYP3A4-generated form of) OHvemurafenib from 0.5% to approximately 4% over this time
period. It took 18 days for 95% of the radioactive dose to be
recovered; 94% in feces, 1% in urine (15). Metabolic proﬁling was
carried out on the 68.5% of the total dose that was recovered
within the ﬁrst 96 hours. Over the 0- to 48-hour period, 94% of
the radioactivity recovered was in the parental form. Over the 48to 96-hour period, however, this value decreased to 55.5% 
20.1%. OH-vemurafenib accounted for 13.7% of the radioactivity
recovered from the 48- to 96-hour samples (3.4% of the total
dose). Conjugated (glucosylated and glucuronidated) forms of
vemurafenib were the only other metabolites deﬁnitively identiﬁed in these samples (11, 12, 15). Although the percentage of
vemurafenib excreted in the form of metabolites was low relative
to the parent compound, it was acknowledged that a large
proportion of the parent compound eliminated during the ﬁrst
48 hours might constitute drug that had not been absorbed, and a
signiﬁcant proportion of the vemurafenib excreted during the 48to 96-hour post-dose period might have been generated by
hepatobiliary recirculation. Indeed, it was also reported that
metabolites predominated over the parent compound in a bile
sample from one of the patients receiving vemurafenib (15). As
the absolute bioavailibility of vemurafenib is unknown, and
hence the contribution of metabolism to its elimination cannot
be calculated, phase IV clinical trials assessing the effect of an
inhibitor and an inducer of CYP3A4 in the PK of vemurafenib
have been requested by both the FDA and EMA. At present, an
inhibitor (ketoconazole) study (NCT01765556) has been withdrawn and an inducer (rifampicin) study (NCT01765543) is
recruiting (clinicaltrials.gov). Despite the occurrence of CYPdependent hydroxylation of vemurafenib in vitro, we found that
the in vivo effect of CYP3A4 in modulating the systemic levels of a
single dose of the compound in humanized mice was small. Far
more apparent was a decrease in AUCall following activation of
Pxr, which was independent of CYP3A4 as it occurred in both the
Cyp3aKO/Cyp3a13þ/þ and huCYP3A4/3A7 lines. This decrease
was even more pronounced following activation of PXR in the
huPXR/huCAR and huPXR/huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7 mouse lines
with RIF. The likely explanation for the differing magnitudes of
this decrease is that, at the doses used, PCN-mediated activation of
mPxr (and thereby induction of the downstream effector proteins) is less effective than RIF-mediated activation of hPXR (20).
Preincubation of vemurafenib-resistant clones of the
BRAFV600E-positive A375 melanoma cell line with verapamil, an
ABCB1 inhibitor, partially increased their sensitivity to the drug
(29). Studies with the MDCK-ABCB1 cell line demonstrated that
vemurafenib was both an ABCB1 substrate and inhibitor (12),
and a post-authorization report mentions evidence of an interaction with ABCG2 (30). These observations have been conﬁrmed
independently, and studies in mice nulled for these transporters

www.aacrjournals.org

either separately or in combination have found that they modulate both intestinal bioavailability and permeability at the
blood–brain barrier (16, 17, 31). This synergistic interaction of
Abcb1 and Abcg2 is a phenomenon that has been shown to
modulate the bioavailability of other therapeutics (32). ABCB1
is a transcriptional target of PXR in human cells (33, 34), and this
interaction is thought to be conserved for Abcb1a in the mouse
(35, 36). There is some evidence that Pxr also regulates Abcg2
(37). Our measurements of Abcb1a, Abcb1b, and Abcg2 mRNA
levels in the small intestine of huPXR/huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7
mice demonstrate that, of these, only the ﬁrst was induced
following RIF treatment. Activation of CAR by PB induced
Cyp2b10 to the same extent as activation of PXR by RIF, while
also weakly inducing CYP3A4, but this pretreatment had no effect
on the PK parameters of vemurafenib. Taken together, these
observations suggest that the Pxr/PXR-dependent modulation of
vemurafenib PK is likely to be due to the upregulation of Abcb1a,
and hence a decrease in the bioavailability of vemurafenib, rather
than to induction of drug metabolism enzymes. Although PXR
regulates the transcription of other drug-metabolizing enzymes in
humanized mice, such as UDP-glucuronsyltransferases (UGT) of
the 1a subfamily (38), our contention that the observed effects are
due to the modulation of transport are supported by the ﬁnding
that administration of the Abcb1/Abcg2 inhibitor, elacridar, 90
minutes before administration of vemurafenib completely ablated the effect of RIF pretreatment in huPXR/huCAR/huCYP3A4/
3A7 mice. Furthermore, elacridar pretreatment of uninduced (i.e.,
not pretreated with RIF) huPXR/huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7 mice
increased AUCall of vemurafenib by a degree comparable with
pretreatment of induced mice, suggesting that inhibition of efﬂux
transporters in the basal state can profoundly increase vemurafenib bioavailability. It should be noted that, although elacridar is
often cited as a speciﬁc inhibitor of ABCB1/Abcb1 and ABCG2/
Abcg2, this is not the case. At the dose used in this study, the
predicted plasma concentration of elacridar is an order of magnitude below the IC50 value for CYP3A4 and other P450s (26, 27).
However, this compound is known to inhibit SLCO1B1 (39) and
is highly likely to inhibit other transporters (40). Therefore,
although we cannot conclusively state that PXR-directed modulation of Abcb1a level in the small intestine is the pivotal determinant of AUCall of vemurafenib, this remains the most likely
explanation. In support of this, studies in the Abcb1a/b and Bcrp
knockout mouse lines suggested a predominant role for the
former transporter (16). Increased drug efﬂux mediated by ABC
transporter proteins in the cancer cell is a mechanism of multidrug
resistance that has been understood for nearly 40 years (41). As a
class of therapeutics, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, are no less vulnerable to this process than conventional
chemotherapeutics (42). The demonstration that drug transporters can markedly affect in vivo vemurafenib PK implies that
changes in their expression in the tumor itself will also be a factor
in drug response. Surprisingly, to date, this possibility has not
been investigated.
During preclinical development, it was posited that decreases
in the steady-state blood plasma concentrations of vemurafenib
in dogs on a twice-daily dosing regimen between 29 and 92 days
might be due to the induction of metabolism (11). Furthermore,
in patients at steady state, vemurafenib decreased AUC0-last of the
CYP3A4-speciﬁc probe, midazolam, by 39%, increased AUC0-last
of the CYP1A2 probe, caffeine, by 160%, and increased AUC0-last
of the CYP2D6 probe, dextromethorphan, by 47% (11, 12). This

deﬁned vemurafenib as an inducer of CYP3A4, a moderate
inhibitor of CYP1A2 and a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. In agreement with these ﬁndings, we observed strong induction of
CYP3A4-promoter–driven luciferase activity in a cell line–based
reporter assay for PXR with crystalline vemurafenib. During the
phase I clinical trial, vemurafenib was reformulated from a
crystalline to an MBP form to improve bioavailability (5). With
this formulation, AUC0–24 is proportional to doses of between
240 and 960 mg twice daily (2, 5, 43). In the present study, we
administered MBP vemurafenib to huPXR/huCAR/huCYP3A4/
3A7 mice to assess the drug–drug interaction potential of this
compound in this mouse model in vivo. Moreover, the AUCall of
1,142  242 hmmol/L observed at this dose is approximately four
times the AUC0–24 of 300 hmmol/L cited as being necessary to
effect regression of COLO205 xenografts (44) and, with twicedaily dosing, was considered to be sufﬁciently representative of
the steady state level of exposure in humans (AUC0–24 ¼ 1,741 
639 hmmol/L; ref. 5). In addition, the Cmax of this single dose, at
121.7  19.7 mmol/L, is above the mean value of 86  32 mmol/L
reported in patients at steady state (5). With these parameters, in
silico analysis predicted that steady-state concentrations in mice
would be achieved within approximately 32 hours (i.e., with the
fourth dose) on a schedule of two doses per day, 8 hours apart
(data not shown). Under these conditions we observed induction
of CYP3A4 in the liver of huPXR/huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7 mice
administered a high dose of the MBP formulation twice daily for 4
days, although the level of this induction was slight and highly
variable. Nevertheless, our in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate
that vemurafenib has the capacity to induce CYP3A4. In addition,
we observed induction of Cyp1a and Cyp2b proteins in huPXR/
huCAR/huCYP3A4/3A7 mice. These effects may, in part, be due to
activation of PXR, but are likely also due to the activation of one or
more additional transcription factors, such as the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (45). In addition to possible overall effects on drug
PK, the capacity of vemurafenib to activate transcription factors
involved in drug disposition raises the possibility that it may
induce its own metabolism and efﬂux in tumor cells. This could
potentially be a signiﬁcant factor in the acquisition of drug
resistance. Similar effects might also be invoked by comedications
that activate these transcription factors.
In conclusion, we have found that vemurafenib interacts with
the P450 system in vitro, but that PXR-directed regulation of efﬂux

transporters and the consequent modulation of bioavailability
are likely to be a more important factor in deﬁning disposition in
vivo. In addition, we have demonstrated that vemurafenib has the
capacity to activate PXR, and potentially other transcription
factors, at clinically relevant concentrations. Taken together, our
observations support the case for therapeutic monitoring of
vemurafenib levels in patients over the course of therapy to
evaluate whether low systemic drug concentrations coincide with
innate or acquired resistance, and to determine whether modulators of PXR/CYP3A4/ABCB1 activity inﬂuence the outcome of
vemurafenib therapy.
