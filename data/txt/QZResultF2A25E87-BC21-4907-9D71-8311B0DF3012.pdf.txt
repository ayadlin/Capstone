Abstract
The ability of tumor cells to adapt to therapeutic regimens by
activating alternative survival and growth pathways remains a
major challenge in cancer therapy. Therefore, the most effective
treatments will involve interactive strategies that target multiple
nonoverlapping pathways while eliciting synergistic outcomes
and minimizing systemic toxicities. Nanoliposomal irinotecan is
approved by the FDA for gemcitabine-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer . However, the full potential of irinotecan treatment
is hindered by several cancer cell survival mechanisms, including
ATP-binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) transporter-mediated irinotecan efﬂux from cells. Here, we demonstrate that benzoporphyrin
derivative-based photodynamic therapy (PDT), a photochemical
cytotoxic modality that activates the apoptotic pathway, reduced

ABCG2 expression to increase intracellular irinotecan levels in
pancreatic cancer. Moreover, we show that PDT inhibited survivin
expression. Although PDT potentiated irinotecan treatment, we
also demonstrate that irinotecan reduced the tumoral expression
of monocarboxylate transporter 4, which was upregulated by
PDT. Notably, using orthotopic xenograft models, we demonstrate that combination of single low-dose PDT and a subclinical
dose of nanoliposomal irinotecan synergistically inhibited tumor
growth by 70% for 3 weeks compared with 25% reduction after
either monotherapies. Our ﬁndings offer new opportunities for
the clinical translation of PDT and irinotecan combination therapy for effective pancreatic cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 76(5);

Introduction

to topoisomerase–DNA complexes, preventing DNA religation,
causing DNA-strand breaks, and leading to cell death (3). In a
recent phase III trial for patients with gemcitabine-refractory
metastatic pancreatic cancer, a nanoliposomal irinotecan formulation (MM-398) combined with ﬂuorouracil and leucovorin
extended the median overall survival (OS, primary endpoint) to
6.1 months, compared with 4.2 months for the ﬂuorouracil and
leucovorin control (4, 5). This marginal improvement in OS was
viewed as a signiﬁcant breakthrough, highlighting the dismal
nature of pancreatic cancer, and reafﬁrming the need for alternative, intelligently designed interventions.
Although efforts have been made to develop chemotherapeutic
and biologic cocktails to address challenges, such as multidrug
resistance and upregulation of survival pathways, these attempts
have largely been hindered by high toxicities associated with these
agents adding to the already toxic regimens. It is, therefore,
important to devise combinations that complement each other
mechanistically to abrogate resistance pathways, while minimizing systemic toxicities.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a well-established photochemistry-based approach where a noncytotoxic agent (i.e., photosensitizer) is excited by appropriate wavelength light to generate
cytotoxic molecular species, killing or modulating cells (6). PDT
uniquely stimulates cell death by directly activating apoptosis,
and therefore bypasses many cell death signaling pathways
required for chemoradiation to be effective. Kessel and colleagues
ﬁrst report that PDT-induced mitochondrial photodamage results

Cancer cells can ingeniously adapt themselves to therapeutic
insults by adjusting their growth and survival signaling circuitry
through cross-talk loops (1). Thus, there is an increasing focus on
combination therapies that offer enhanced effects by imparting
damage to different cellular compartments and molecular pathways (2). Besides their therapeutic beneﬁts, these combinations
are more attractive and viable for translation if the agents are
approved by the FDA and have nonoverlapping side effects (2).
Irinotecan, a camptothecin derivative, is approved for treatment of pancreatic and other cancers. This S-phase–speciﬁc chemotherapeutic agent inhibits topoisomerase I action by binding

PDT Modulates Molecular Targets to Potentiate Irinotecan

in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, destruction of
mitochondria-associated Bcl-2, release of cytochrome c and
subsequent apoptosis initiation (7), a ﬁnding conﬁrmed by
Xue and colleagues (8). This direct induction of apoptosis
makes PDT effective even against chemo/radio-resistant cancers
with defective signaling pathways (9). Several studies have also
shown that the unique mechanisms of cell death activated by
PDT can resensitize drug-resistant cells (10) and synergize with
both chemo and biologic therapies, such as receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (11, 12). Gallagher-Colombo and colleagues
showed that priming PDT with EGFR inhibitor erlotinib
improved treatment efﬁcacy in non–small cell lung carcinoma
xenografts, even in erlotinib-resistant tumors (11). Our group
has demonstrated that PDT cooperates mechanistically with
anti-EGFR antibody, Erbitux, to synergistically increase survival
in disseminated ovarian cancer models (12). In the context
of chemotherapeutic combinations, Duska and colleagues
showed that PDT via photoimmunoconjugates enhanced the
cytotoxicity of cisplatin in ovarian cancer, and such enhancement is also synergistic on platinum-resistant cells (10). PDT,
which has received regulatory approval worldwide, is already a
successful adjuvant therapy in clinical trials for several malignancies where most therapies have failed. For pancreatic cancer,
Bown and colleagues showed that chlorin-based PDT improved
the median survival from 6–10 to 12.5 months in locally
advanced pancreatic cancer patients (13). Our phase I/II trial
reafﬁrms that benzoporphyrin derivative (BPD)-based PDT
consistently induced tumor necrosis at 40 J/cm in patients with
localized pancreatic cancer (14).
Here, we demonstrate multiple cooperative mechanistic interactions between PDT and irinotecan, showing for the ﬁrst time
that PDT reduces ATP-binding cassette G2 (ABCG2) efﬂux transporter expression to increase intracellular irinotecan concentrations and that PDT inhibits survivin expression to enhance
apoptosis. We also show that irinotecan reduces the tumoral
expression of the monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT-4), a
biomarker that was upregulated by PDT. The combination of
PDT and irinotecan is also attractive for cancer treatment due to
their nonoverlapping side effects. The systemic toxicities associated with irinotecan include grade 3–4 diarrhea and neutropenia
(4), and patients often require dose reduction or preemptive
management. In contrast, PDT is well tolerated in pancreatic
cancer treatment and the only major adverse event of "mild"
abdominal pain can be alleviated using analgesics (14). Therefore,
we hypothesize that a low-dose PDT and irinotecan combination
(12- to 20-fold lower than equivalent clinical effective doses;
Supplementary Table S1) would be more tolerable and synergistic
due to the unique counterbalancing mechanisms.
Advances in nanoliposomes have provided the means to preferentially deliver chemotherapeutic agents or photosensitizers to
tumors, reducing systemic toxicities and improving outcomes
(15). Clinically, nanoliposomes improved the pharmacokinetics
and biodistribution of irinotecan, minimizing side effects (4).
Non-pegylated nanoliposomal BPD (Visudyne) is approved by
the FDA for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration,
and used in pancreatic cancer clinical studies (14). Encouraged by
these clinical advances, and motivated by the need for innovative,
easily translatable treatments, we hypothesized that the distinct
mechanisms of PDT and irinotecan, combined with mutually
reinforcing molecular responses, would provide synergistic outcomes. Using nanoliposomal formulations of BPD and irinote-

can, we investigated the antitumor efﬁcacy of low-dose combination therapy in orthotopic MIA PaCa-2 and AsPC-1 tumor
models.

Materials and Methods
Nanoliposome preparation and characterization
Nanoliposomal BPD (L-BPD) and nanoliposomal irinotecan
(L-IRI) were prepared via freeze–thaw extrusion (Supplementary
Methods; ref. 15). Zetasizer NanoZS (Malvern) measured particle
size and zeta potential. Concentrations of BPD and irinotecan
were determined based on their absorbance spectra in DMSO
using established molar extinction coefﬁcients (BPD: e ¼ 34,895
M1cm1 at 687 nm; Irinotecan: e ¼ 21,835 M1cm1 at 384
nm). Entrapment efﬁcacy is deﬁned as the molar ratio of drug
entrapped into nanoliposomes to total drug added initially.
Loading capacity is determined on the basis of the ratio of ﬁnal
drug weight to overall weight of the nanoliposomes. BPD quenching, photobleaching, and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation were
studied in 96-well plates. L-BPD and singlet oxygen sensor green
(SOSG) at 5 mmol/L were irradiated with 690-nm light at different
ﬂuences (0–75 J/cm2, 50 mW/cm2, Intense-High Power Devices,
Series-7401). A microplate reader (Molecular Devices) acquired
ﬂuorescence signals of BPD (Ex/Em:422/650–750 nm) or SOSG
(Ex/Em:504/525 nm) before and after irradiation. Drug release
was studied in 10% human serum at 37 C using dialysis.
In vitro molecular characterization post-PDT
MIA PaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells were obtained from ATCC
between 2012 and 2015, cultured as per manufacturer's instructions, and tested for mycoplasma contamination. A total of
150,000 cells grown overnight were incubated with L-BPD
(250 nmol/L) for 1 hour. Before PDT, L-BPD–containing medium
was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were irradiated with
690-nm light at different ﬂuences (0.5–5 J/cm2, 50 mW/cm2).
At 1, 6, or 24 hours post-PDT, detached cells were removed via
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) washes and remaining cells
assessed for viability (MTT assay, Invitrogen) or biomarkers
(ABCG2, survivin) by immunoﬂuorescence and immunoblotting
(Supplementary Methods).
Evaluation of intracellular irinotecan accumulation
post-PDT
A total of 250,000 cells grown overnight were incubated in
medium containing L-BPD (250 nmol/L) and L-IRI (0.24 mg/mL)
for 1 hour. Before PDT (690 nm, 0.5 J/cm2), the medium was
replaced with either L-IRI–containing medium or "drug-free"
medium. At 1 or 6 hours post-PDT, cells were washed and lysed
with Solvable. A microplate reader (Molecular Devices) measured
ﬂuorescence signal from irinotecan (Ex/Em:355/460 nm) and its
metabolite SN-38 (Ex/Em:355/538 nm). Readouts were normalized to protein concentration (Pierce BCA Protein Assay).
Orthotopic mouse model
Animal protocols were approved by MGH Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Orthotopic MIA PaCa-2 or
AsPC-1 tumors were established in male athymic (nu/nu) Swiss
mice (4–6 weeks old). A 1-cm incision on the left abdominal ﬂank
was made to exteriorize the pancreas of ketamine/xylazine–anesthetized mouse. Cancer cells (1  106) suspended in 50 mL

medium-Matrigel mixture, were injected into the pancreas, and
the incision was sutured aseptically.
Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of L-BPD and L-IRI
Tumor-bearing mice received intravenous injection of L-IRI (20
mg/kg) and L-BPD (0.25 mg/kg). Blood, tumor, and tissues were
collected 10 minutes, 1, 4, 12, and 24 hours postinjections. BPD
and irinotecan were extracted from tissue samples (Supplementary Methods), and then quantiﬁed via liquid chromatography/
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS, Agilent) for the determination of %ID/g (percentage injected dose per gram tissue).
In vivo combination treatment
Treatments were initiated 9 days postimplantation when
tumors reached approximately 25 mm3 (Supplementary Fig.
S1A). One hour post-intravenous injection of low-dose L-BPD
(0.25 mg/kg) and L-IRI (20 mg/kg), an incision was made on the
left abdominal ﬂank to exteriorize the tumor of anesthetized mice.
A vertical light beam was focused on the tumor, and cloth was

used to protect animal skin from light exposure. PDT was performed with a 690-nm laser (75 J/cm2, 100 mW/cm2). Light
irradiation coincides with the BPD Q-band absorbance (Fig.
1A, arrow) without overlapping with irinotecan absorbance.
Posttreatment, incisions were sutured. Tumor growth in every
animal was longitudinally monitored every 3 to 5 days using
noninvasive ultrasound imaging (Supplementary Methods). At
each time point, tumor volume was calculated using ellipsoid
estimation (width  length  height  p/6), which was validated
against the three-dimensional volume reconstruction algorithm
of the Vevo2100 software (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C).
Animals were euthanized on day 30. Collected tissues were
processed for (i) histologic (hematoxylin and eosin stain, H&E)
analysis of necrosis and (ii) immunoﬂuorescence analysis of
microvessel density (MVD, CD31 vascular endothelial marker)
and proliferation (Ki-67; Supplementary Methods). In a small
group of animals, tumors were excised at 24 hours posttreatment
to analyze hypoxia (pimonidazole) and biomarker (MCT-4;
Supplementary Methods and Table S2). H&E and immunoﬂuorescence slides were imaged using a whole slide scanning ﬂuorescence imaging system (Hamamatsu) or a confocal microscope
(Olympus; Supplementary Methods). In a separate study, mice
were treated with two cycles of combination therapy on days 9 and
27 postimplantation.

Statistical analysis
To compare treatment responses, one-way ANOVA statistical
tests were carried out to avoid type-I error (GraphPad Prism).
Synergy between PDT and L-IRI is determined to be signiﬁcant via
random slopes model (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table S3). Results are presented in mean  SEM.

Synthesis and characterization of nanoliposomes
For L-BPD and L-IRI syntheses, lipid compositions of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine-methoxy polyethylene glycol were used on the
basis of clinically approved formulations (15). Both L-BPD and
L-IRI were grafted with 3 mol% of polyethylene glycol and are
approximately 120 to 135 nm with a narrow size distribution
(polydispersity index, PdI < 0.1; Supplementary Table S4). The
surface charge of nanoliposomes was engineered to be neutralto-slightly cationic (þ12 mV), by introducing dioleoyltrimethylammoniumpropane (8 mol%) to the lipid composition,
to balance toxicity, circulation, and tumor accumulation (15).
Concentrations of BPD or irinotecan in nanoliposomes were
determined on the basis of their respective absorbance spectra
in DMSO (Fig. 1A). BPD was loaded in the lipid-bilayer via
hydrophobic and ionic interactions (16) at entrapment efﬁciency of 70.7  8%. Hydrophilic irinotecan was encapsulated
in the aqueous core through passive equilibration (17) at a
lower entrapment efﬁciency of 56.6  4%. L-IRI loading capacity (10.2  1%) was higher than that of L-BPD (0.42  0.05%)
due to the high aqueous-to-lipid compartment volume ratio of
nanoliposomes (18). This corresponded to approximately
14,000 irinotecan molecules per L-IRI, and 600 BPD molecules
per L-BPD. Our long-term stability study suggested that 4month dark storage at 4 C did not affect overall size or
monodispersity of nanoliposomes (Fig. 1B and C).

PDT Modulates Molecular Targets to Potentiate Irinotecan

Drug release proﬁles of L-BPD and L-IRI were evaluated under
biologically relevant conditions (37 C, 10% serum). At 1 hour
postincubation, approximately 10% and 30% of BPD and irinotecan were released from nanoliposomes, respectively (Fig. 1D).
Relatively fast drug release from L-IRI (t1/2 ¼ 2 hours) compared
with L-BPD (t1/2 ¼ 48 hours) suggests that irinotecan will be
readily available to tumors when PDT is in action.
Our in vivo pharmacokinetic study (Fig. 1E) shows that plasma
clearance of L-IRI (clearance rate, pCL: 0.61L/kg  hour; AUC:
32.52 mg  hour/mL) is faster than that of L-BPD (pCL: 0.06 L/kg
 hour; AUC: 4.267 mg  hour/mL). It is important to note that
plasma clearance of L-IRI is still signiﬁcantly slower than that of
free irinotecan (pCL: 2.61 L/kg  hour; AUC: 7.65 mg  hour/mL;
ref. 19). This suggests that nanoliposomes improve the circulation
proﬁle of irinotecan, an important factor in the cytotoxicity of
irinotecan. At 1 hour post-intravenous injection, accumulation of
irinotecan was higher in tumor (15.3  2.2%ID/g) than in normal
pancreas (3.4  0.3%ID/g). Liver and spleen were organs of major
L-BPD and L-IRI accumulation, respectively (Fig. 1F).
Photostability and photoactivity of L-BPD
Nanoliposomes have been shown to maintain the stability and
photoactivity of photosensitizers in biologically relevant environments for effective PDT (20). However, photosensitizers could
also be prone to self-quenching when packed in lipid bilayers at
high concentrations (16). Here, we evaluated the photostability
and quenching of free BPD and L-BPD by monitoring changes in
BPD absorbance and ﬂuorescence before and after dissolution in
different solvents. In our BPD stability studies, the absorbance
value at 690 nm for free BPD in PBS was reduced by 81.3  3%
compared with free BPD fully dissolved in DMSO, indicating a
rapid aggregation of free BPD molecules in PBS (Fig. 2A). Aggregation of free BPD in PBS led to a nearly complete (95%)
ﬂuorescence quenching compared with free BPD in DMSO (Fig.
2B). In contrast, nanoliposomes facilitated monomerization of
photosensitizers. Up to 75% "recovery" of BPD's 690 nm peak was
restored by the nanoliposomes (Fig. 2C). The BPD's ﬂuorescence
emission was restored by 40% in PBS (Fig. 2D).
We further tested whether L-BPD can be photoactivated to
generate cytotoxic 1O2 in serum-containing medium. Upon
light-activation of L-BPD, we observed a light-dose–dependent
decrease of BPD ﬂuorescence due to photobleaching of BPD
(Fig. 2E). Approximately 20% of BPD molecules in nanoliposomes were photobleached at 75 J/cm2, and this was found
similar to the photobleaching of free BPD molecules that are
well dispersed in DMSO. Subsequently, the formation of 1O2
upon light-activation of L-BPD was monitored using SOSG
sensors. During light irradiation of L-BPD, we observed a dosedependent increase of SOSG ﬂuorescence intensity, which was
markedly higher than that generated by free BPD under the
same conditions (Fig. 2F). These data suggested that nanoliposomes retain a signiﬁcant portion of BPD in their monomeric
photoactive form. Therefore, L-BPD could effectively produce
cytotoxic 1O2 upon photoactivation.
Photodestruction of ABCG2 increases intracellular irinotecan
A major obstacle encountered in cancer chemotherapy is multidrug resistance, a process mediated by ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transmembrane transporters that utilize energy from
ATP-binding/hydrolysis to actively pump chemotherapeutic
agents out of cells (21). Overexpression of ABCG2 confers che-

moresistance to pancreatic cancer cells and limits irinotecan
efﬁcacy (22). Several ABC transporter inhibitors have been investigated, but their drug–drug interactions with chemotherapeutic
agents and toxicities limited their clinical usage (23). It is known
that BPD is a substrate for ABCG2 (24), and others have suggested
the possibility of photochemical destruction of "ABCG2-rich"
extracellular vesicles (25). Here, we demonstrated that noncytotoxic low-dose PDT at 0.5 J/cm2 (Supplementary Fig. S2A and
S2B) signiﬁcantly reduced the ABCG2 immunoﬂuorescence signal from MIA PaCa-2 by approximately 70% at 1 and 6 hours
post-PDT (Fig. 3A). Western blots conﬁrmed decreased protein
levels of ABCG2 at these time points in MIA PaCa-2 cells following
the same PDT dose (Fig. 3B). Similar changes were observed in
AsPC-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C–S2E).
Given this PDT-based modulation of ABCG2, for which irinotecan is a known substrate, we subsequently tested whether PDTmediated ABCG2 reduction could affect intracellular irinotecan
accumulation. We observed that MIA PaCa-2 cells treated with
combination of PDT and L-IRI showed 28%  7% and 49%  2%

PDT Modulates Molecular Targets to Potentiate Irinotecan

increases in intracellular irinotecan concentrations at 1 and 6
hours post-PDT, compared with cells treated with L-IRI alone (Fig.
3C). MIA PaCa-2 treated with both PDT and L-IRI also showed
statistically signiﬁcant enhancement in intracellular SN-38 (an
active metabolite of irinotecan) over cells treated with L-IRI at 1hour post-PDT. Increase in intracellular SN-38 was not significant at 6 hours post-PDT (Fig. 3D). This saturation of SN-38 is
presumably due to a limited intracellular concentration of the
carboxylesterase enzyme (26), which is responsible for conversion of irinotecan to SN-38. L-BPD alone (without light) did not
increase intracellular concentrations of irinotecan and SN-38. In
a separate study, L-IRI was removed from the media immediately before PDT, such that there is no contribution from uptake
of L-IRI due to PDT. Higher intracellular levels of irinotecan
were observed 1 hour post-PDT, suggesting that higher amounts
of irinotecan were "retained" in cells (Fig. 3E). Similar enhancements of intracellular irinotecan and SN-38 concentrations postPDT were observed in AsPC-1 (Supplementary Fig. S2F and
S2G). These promising results prompted us to determine whether the combination would improve irinotecan accumulation in
vivo. Indeed, the combination signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) increased
intratumoral irinotecan levels by 3.2-fold and 2.4-fold at 12 and
24 hours post-PDT, respectively, as compared with L-IRI alone
(Fig. 3F and G).
Irinotecan downregulates tumoral MCT-4 expression
upregulated by PDT
Sections from MIA PaCa-2 tumors, excised 24 hours posttreatment, were stained with (i) CD31 (white) to identify vasculature;
(ii) pimonidazole (green), a bioreductive chemical probe that
forms protein adducts in viable hypoxic cells with partial oxygen
pressure (pO2) less than 10 mmHg in tumors; (iii) MCT-4 (red), a
lactate efﬂux pump that allows cancer cells to utilize aberrant
glycolytic metabolism and can be inﬂuenced by abnormal tumor
microenvironment such as that caused by hypoxia (27); and, (iv)
DAPI (blue) to mark nuclei. Figure 4 shows representative immunoﬂuorescence images for these biomarkers in MIA PaCa-2
tumors at 24 hours posttreatment, as well as the corresponding
quantiﬁcation of MCT-4 expression, a biomarker that has been
linked with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer (28). In determining the treatment-induced changes in MCT-4 expression, we
separately analyzed pimonidazole positive and pimonidazole
negative regions, as pimonidazole only stains distinct regions
with pO2 below 10 mmHg. These areas are typically adjacent to
necrotic zones that are chronically and severely depleted of
oxygen and, thus, could potentially exhibit a differential response
proﬁle from other regions. The MCT-4 intensity was normalized
to DAPI intensity in either pimonidazole negative regions only
(Fig. 4A and C) or the whole cross-tumor section irrespective of
pimonidazole status (Fig. 4D).
We demonstrated in vivo that L-IRI reduced the immunoﬂuorescence signal of MCT-4 by approximately 52% at 24 hours
postinjection compared with no-treatment controls in pimonidazole-negative regions, while PDT increased MCT-4 staining
compared with no-treatment (Fig. 4A and C). In the combination
group, MCT-4 signiﬁcantly decreased (P < 0.001) in non-pimonidazole–stained areas compared with no-treatment controls.
Similarly, when both pimonidazole-positive and -negative
regions were considered, a decrease (P < 0.05) in MCT-4 signal
was also observed in L-IRI and combination groups (Fig. 4B
and D). However, this magnitude of difference is less pronounced,

www.aacrjournals.org

suggesting that MCT-4 expression may be harder to affect in
regions with low pO2 (	10 mmHg). Overall, these results indicate that in combination, L-IRI acts to reduce the expression of
MCT-4, which we observe to be upregulated by oxygen-consuming BPD-PDT.
Survivin-downregulating PDT in combination with L-IRI
enhances apoptosis in vivo
Survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis, plays an essential role
in regulating apoptosis by inhibiting caspases (29). Decreased
survivin expression has been shown to enhance the efﬁcacy of
camptothecin analogues for several cancers (30). Gomer and
colleagues and others demonstrated that PDT can regulate
survivin expression in cancers, and such apoptotic modulation is dependent on photosensitizer and cell type (31). At 24
hours post-PDT, we observe that PDT decreased survivin
expression in MIA PaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells, both in vivo and
in vitro (Fig. 5A–C). In addition, immunoblots of MIA PaCa-2
tumors show that survivin expression remained low in vivo
at 24 hours after the combination treatment (Fig. 5C). In
these same tumors, we observe a concomitant increase in
tumoral expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP
overall. Together, the low expression of survivin and increased
levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 suggest that
the combination enhances apoptosis in vivo, relative to the
monotherapies.
Combination treatment enhances tumor growth inhibition
The above mechanistic insights provided us a compelling
rationale to assess the combination of PDT and L-IRI in orthotopic mouse models of MIA PaCa-2 and AsPC-1. Metastasisderived AsPC-1 tumors exhibited faster growth rates than MIA
PaCa-2 (Supplementary Fig. S3), in accordance with previous
reports citing differences in tumorigenicity, immunocytochemistry, and histology for these cell lines (32). A single low-dose
combination of PDT (L-BPD: 0.25 mg/kg) and L-IRI (20 mg/kg)
demonstrated superior MIA PaCa-2 tumor volume growth
inhibition by approximately 70% for at least 3 weeks, compared with <25% reduction after monotherapies (Fig. 6A). The
slope of linearized growth curves for the combination group
(PDTþL-IRI) was signiﬁcantly lower (P ¼ 0.0191) than the
"sum" of the slopes for both monotherapies (PDT alone and LIRI alone), suggesting the combination is synergistic (Supplementary Table S3).
At 3 weeks posttreatment (30 days postimplantation),
tumor weights in the combination group (195  30 mg)
were signiﬁcantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of no-treatment
(373  45 mg) and L-BPD groups (399  30 mg; Fig. 6B).
There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in tumor
weight between the L-IRI (314  24 mg) and L-BPDþL-IRI
groups (318  57 mg), suggesting that L-BPD alone without
light is not tumoricidal. Although tumor weights in the
combination group (195  30 mg) were lower than that in
the L-IRI group (314  24 mg), this was not statistically
signiﬁcant. Given this observation, we also compared changes
in tumor volume at 2 weeks posttreatment (i.e., right before
tumor regrowth was observed in the combination group; Fig.
6C). Interestingly, at 2 weeks posttreatment, the fold-increase
in tumor volume for the combination group (1.8-fold) was
found to be signiﬁcantly lower than the L-IRI group (5.2fold), L-BPDþL-IRI group (5.1-fold), and no-treatment

group (5.9-fold), but not signiﬁcantly different than the
PDT group (3.3-fold). These data suggest that this combination balances the initial PDT actions with the sustained
irinotecan therapeutic effects. In vivo efﬁcacy of the combination regimen was further evaluated in AsPC-1 tumors. At 3
weeks posttreatment, a single combination treatment cycle
reduced AsPC-1 tumor volume (Fig. 6D) and weight (Fig. 6E)
by an average of 66.6% and 58.1%, respectively, compared
with no-treatment. In contrary, tumor weights and volumes in
the PDT (e.g., 260  86 mm2) and L-IRI groups (e.g., 219 
28 mm2) were not signiﬁcantly different from no-treatment
(e.g., 302  48 mm2).
For both MIA PaCa-2 and AsPC-1, tumor regrowth was

tion treatment. A second cycle of low-dose combination therapy
prolonged the inhibition of MIA PaCa-2 tumor growth up to 42
days postimplantation (Fig. 6F). No animal death or changes in
mouse weight were observed (Supplementary Fig. S4). General
behavior and physiologic activities of mice were normal as per
IACUC guidelines.
Effect of PDT and L-IRI on tumor-related biomarkers
Studies show that MVD estimation is a promising treatment
response indicator (33). Here, we evaluate MVD via CD31-staining of vascular endothelial cells to determine tumor vascularization. Confocal images of MIA PaCa-2 cross-sections at 3-weeks

PDT Modulates Molecular Targets to Potentiate Irinotecan

lower in the combination group compared with no-treatment
(Fig. 7A). White arrows indicate microvessels, which are clearly
smaller post-combination therapy. Quantitative analyses
revealed that the combination resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease
(P < 0.05) in MVD by approximately 30%, whereas suboptimal
PDT alone or L-IRI alone did not reduce tumoral MVD (Fig. 7C).
Consistent with this antivascular effect, quantitative analyses
revealed a dramatic (P < 0.05) reduction of Ki-67-staining by
>60% in tumors receiving the combination treatment, compared with no-treatment (Fig. 7D). Supporting the synergistic
impact of the treatments on proliferation and vasculature
destruction, we observed enhanced necrotic volumes in combination-treated tumors compared with all other groups (Fig.
7B and E). A low-dose combination treatment provided sustained tumor growth inhibition but did not eradicate the tumor
completely. Indeed, H&E images of tumors in combination
treatment group (Fig. 7B) show a viable rim of tumor 3 weeks
posttreatment, indicating the necessity of multiple treatments
for potentially complete treatment.

Discussion
The uniqueness of the PDT and L-IRI combination is that they
mechanistically cooperate with each other, beyond their individual tumor destruction pathways, to enhance reduction in tumor
burden with nonoverlapping toxicities. Here, three cooperative
pathways are demonstrated to elucidate the synergism: (i) PDT
reduces ABCG2 expression, thereby increasing intracellular irinotecan and SN-38 levels; (ii) irinotecan reduces tumoral expression
of MCT-4, which is upregulated by PDT; (iii) PDT downregulates

survivin expression, and ampliﬁcation of the apoptotic and antiproliferative effects was observed in the combination. The dramatic enhancement in tumor growth inhibition by the combination treatment conﬁrms the strength of developing mechanistically cooperative combinations, where each monotherapy
enhances and beneﬁts from the other, for difﬁcult-to-treat diseases, such as pancreatic cancer.
Late diagnosis and limited effectiveness of standard treatments
have resulted in a 5-year survival rate of 	5% in pancreatic cancer
patients (34). Pancreatic cancer is notoriously resistant to chemoradiotherapies, partly attributable to inherent genetic complexities and abnormal microenvironment (35). Several combination therapies have been clinically evaluated for pancreatic
cancer, but most were abandoned due to ineffectiveness and high
toxicities (36). Recently, Abraxane plus gemcitabine showed
modest 2-month improvements in median OS compared with
gemcitabine alone (37). FOLFIRINOX, a combination of four
chemotherapeutic agents (leucovorin, ﬂuorouracil, irinotecan,
oxaliplatin), generated much excitement after extending the
median OS from 6.8 to 11.1 months (38). However, FOLFIRINOX is limited to a small proportion of healthy patients due to
high toxicities. Against this background, PDT is emerging as a
clinically promising locoregional therapy for pancreatic cancer
(13, 14), given its efﬁcacy against gemcitabine-insensitive cells
(39), synergism with chemo/biologic agents, and low incidence of
mild adverse events clinically (14). PDT has also been shown to
induce antitumor immunity in various immunocompetent cancer
models (40).
Driven by this concept of developing rapidly translatable
combinations where each component reinforces the other, our
study is motivated by advances in nanoliposomal BPD-based PDT
(phase I/II) and the recently FDA-approved nanoliposomal irinotecan (Onivyde) for pancreatic cancer (4, 14, 41). In this study,
nanoliposomes improved the photochemical stability of BPD and
the circulation proﬁle of irinotecan, supporting the reduced
systemic toxicity, and increased efﬁcacy of nanoliposomal BPD
and irinotecan that have been established (20, 42). In our in vivo
combination, L-BPD and L-IRI were administered intravenously
simultaneously and PDT was performed 1 hour postinjection,
when both agents were readily available at the tumor for their
cooperative therapeutic actions.
Here, sublethal PDT reduced ABCG2 expression and increased
intracellular concentrations of irinotecan and SN-38 by up to
approximately 50% 6 hours posttreatment (Fig. 3C and D),
whereas L-BPD alone does not interfere with intracellular irinotecan accumulation. Moreover, PDT-mediated ABCG2 reduction
was sustainable for up to 24 hours (Fig. 3B). Studies have shown
that durable maintenance of high intratumoral irinotecan and
SN-38 levels is a critical determinant of antitumor activity (43).
Therefore, a sustained window of ABCG2-reduction could be
important for enhanced irinotecan efﬁcacy. It should be noted
that at 24 hours, expression of ABCG2 appears to recover (Fig. 3B),
although remaining lower than pre-PDT levels. This observation
suggests that subsequent treatments of PDT and future optimization of PDT dose may be warranted for prolonged ABCG2
reduction.
In vivo, PDT (one-hour L-BPD-light interval) enhanced intratumoral irinotecan accumulation by more than 3-fold at 12 hours
posttreatment, compared with L-IRI alone. Our previous work
demonstrated that PDT with 1-hour BPD-light interval targets
both tumor cells and vasculature (44). Therefore, it is important to

note that, besides the reduction of cellular ABCG2 expression,
other mechanisms could also contribute to PDT-mediated
enhancement of intratumoral drug accumulation. Previous studies have shown that BPD-PDT at a short photosensitizer-light
interval of 15 minutes mainly causes vascular permeabilization,
which leads to a modest enhancement (	2-fold) of macromol-

(including ABCG2 photodestruction) and vascular permeabilization for maximal drug accumulation are merited. Although many

with small-molecule inhibitors, most studies have failed due to
drug interactions and systemic toxicities (23). PDT, an FDAapproved regimen with nonoverlapping toxicities, provides a
unique opportunity for inhibition of irinotecan efﬂux transporters, while avoiding those toxicity-related pitfalls.
Several studies have shown that oncogenic Ras-driven signals in
pancreatic cancer cells can propel abnormal metabolic alterations,
such as dependence on glycolysis. MCT-4 is a critical component
in the glycolytic metabolism of pancreatic cancer cells, and can be
further upregulated via several tumor microenvironmental
changes such as hypoxia (27). Studies have shown that high
MCT-4 expression is a poor prognostic indicator in pancreatic
cancer and that inhibition of MCT-4 leads to tumor growth
suppression and increased cellular apoptosis (28). PDT can create
tumor hypoxia when oxygen is depleted by photochemical consumption or when oxygen supply is compromised by microvascular damage (46). These hypoxic conditions can stimulate metabolic alterations, harbor treatment resistant cells, and drive the
cells towards metastatic invasion through activation of pathways,
such as HIF1a (47). A unique feature of our combination is that
irinotecan alleviates a compensatory response elicited by PDT. We
show that although PDT elevates MCT-4 expression, the irinotecan component of the combination mitigates this increase and
reduces MCT-4 to levels comparable with irinotecan treatment
alone (Fig. 4). This observed effect, in accordance with the ability

www.aacrjournals.org

of irinotecan to downregulate HIF1a as reported by others (48),
may also reduce metastatic dissemination of the disease in the
combination treatment, and is currently being investigated. A
sustained decrease in MVD is observed with the combination
treatment compared with other groups at 3-weeks posttreatment
(Fig. 7). Although chronic vascular damage likely contributes to
enhanced growth arrest, nutrient depletion and reduced blood
supply could potentially lead to further hypoxia and corresponding survival signals. These conditions suggest that multiple irinotecan cycles may further enhance the two therapies' synergism,
through its effect on hypoxia-induced markers. Although reduction of blood supply may have been a concern for delivery of
subsequent treatments, a second dose of the combination at 27
days postimplantation continues to exhibit synergistic efﬁcacy
and prolongs signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition (Fig. 6F).
Reduction in systemic toxicity is another attractive feature of
PDT and L-IRI combination. Clinically, irinotecan can be prescribed for up to 12 cycles. However, due to its signiﬁcant systemic
toxicities (grade 3–4 diarrhea and neutropenia), patients receive
an average of six cycles and often require dose reductions,
compromising the chemo-effectiveness. PDT is associated with
low incidence of mild abdominal pain, which can be relieved with
analgesia. Normal pancreatic tissue healing has been shown after
interstitial PDT without signiﬁcant impact to structure or function
(14). In addition to nonoverlapping side effects, the combination

Huang et al.

of PDT and L-IRI is signiﬁcant in that enhanced cytotoxic efﬁcacy
can be achieved using drug doses at 12- to 20-fold lower than
equivalent clinical doses (Supplementary Table S1). In this study,
we demonstrated that a single cycle, low-dose combination
dramatically inhibited tumor volume growth by 70%, while
others demonstrated that ﬁve doses of standard gemcitabine
(250 mg/kg) is ineffective against orthotopic MIA PaCa-2 tumors
(49). A second cycle of combination therapy further prolonged
MIA PaCa-2 tumor growth inhibition, and was well tolerated by
mice. This compares favorably with the modest (30%) tumor
weight reduction of orthotopic pancreatic cancer tumors after six
cycles of 25 mg/kg irinotecan (50).
In summary, this study shows that low-dose combination of
PDT and L-IRI synergistically enhanced tumor growth inhibition
compared with either treatment alone and was more effective than
reported outcomes with a standard chemotherapeutics for pancreatic cancer (49, 50). Given the clinical promise of the individual therapies, this combination is easily translatable for clinical
management of pancreatic cancer and other cancers. Further
studies using multicycle dosing for durable response, and evaluating metastasis control and survival enhancement are merited.
