ABSTRACT
Chk1 kinase is a critical component of the DNA damage response checkpoint
especially in cancer cells and targeting Chk1 is a potential therapeutic opportunity for
potentiating the anti-tumor activity of DNA damaging chemotherapy drugs. Fragment
elaboration by structure guided design was utilized to identify and develop a novel
series of Chk1 inhibitors culminating in the identification of V158411, a potent ATPcompetitive inhibitor of the Chk1 and Chk2 kinases. V158411 abrogated gemcitabine
and camptothecin induced cell cycle checkpoints, resulting in the expected modulation
of cell cycle proteins and increased cell death in cancer cells. V158411 potentiated
the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine, cisplatin, SN38 and camptothecin in a variety of p53
deficient human tumor cell lines in vitro, p53 proficient cells were unaffected. In
nude mice, V158411 showed minimal toxicity as a single agent and in combination
with irinotecan. In tumor bearing animals, V158411 was detected at high levels
in the tumor with a long elimination half-life; no pharmacologically significant in
vivo drug-drug interactions with irinotecan were identified through analysis of the
pharmacokinetic profiles. V158411 potentiated the anti-tumor activity of irinotecan in
a variety of human colon tumor xenograft models without additional systemic toxicity.
These results demonstrate the opportunity for combining V158411 with standard of
care chemotherapeutic agents to potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of these agents
without increasing their toxicity to normal cells. Thus, V158411 would warrant further
clinical evaluation.

INTRODUCTION

especially those actively replicating. Therefore, such
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents lack tumor cell
specificity. Administration is usually at the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) resulting in a narrow therapeutic
index and toxicity to normal tissue, especially those
within an actively dividing cell component such as the
gastrointestinal tract and the hematological system.
Acquired or intrinsic resistance can further limit the
usefulness of these agents, making many patients’ tumors
refractory to the drug. Multiple mechanisms can contribute
to acquired resistance including reduced cellular levels of

DNA damaging cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
agents and ionizing radiation are the mainstay of current
cancer treatment regimens. These therapies are effective,
especially when administered in combinations, against a
wide variety of neoplasms and are likely to remain the
standard of care for cancer treatment in the foreseeable
future. Due to their mechanism of action, these agents
have limitations which restrict their overall effectiveness.

active drug (through increased metabolism, detoxification
or active efflux), increased DNA repair, loss of p53 or
attenuation of apoptotic signaling.
Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin,
irinotecan or gemcitabine induce DNA damage, especially
DNA strand breaks, through multiple mechanisms (e.g.
topoisomerase inhibition, direct DNA alkylation or
reduction of deoxyribonucleotides). These strand breaks
activate cell cycle checkpoints resulting in cell cycle arrest
and activation of DNA repair [1, 2]. Cell cycle checkpoints
exist to protect the fidelity of DNA replication and
division, and ensure the correct timing of cell cycle events.
As DNA cannot be replaced, these pathways are critical
in protecting genomic integrity and preventing the onset
of cancer. Checkpoints exist at multiple phases of the
cell cycle and can be activated during the G1-, S- or G2phases in response to DNA damage [3-6]. In addition, the
mitotic checkpoint is activated by improper chromosome
attachment to a bipolar spindle, to protect against
inaccurate chromosome segregation and aneuploidy [7].
In mammalian cells, the key effector proteins are p53 and
the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 [3, 6]. A large
proportion of human cancers are defective for the p53
pathway in some form, thereby lacking a functional G1
checkpoint. Therefore, these human tumors are highly
reliant on the Chk1 kinase to protect them in response to
DNA damage [4, 5].
DNA damage sensing by either the Mre11
complex (Mre11, Rad50 and Nbs1), that recognizes
double strand breaks, or the Rad17 and Rad9-Hus1Rad1 complex that recognizes replication stress, activate
the central transducing kinases ATM and ATR. In turn,
these kinases directly activate the effector kinases Chk1
and Chk2. Chk1 is predominantly activated by three
phosphorylation events; on S317 and S345 by ATR [8, 9]
and autophosphorylation on S296 [10]. Chk1 and Chk2
negatively regulate the Cdc25 family of phosphatases
thereby preventing cell cycle progression as well as
directly modulating repair proteins, resulting in increased
lesion repair [11]. Biochemical and genetic studies have
demonstrated Chk1 to be indispensable for the S- and
G2-M checkpoints [4, 12].
Chk1 inhibition, therefore, represents a novel
therapeutic strategy to increase the cytotoxicity of DNAdamaging chemotherapeutic drugs in p53 pathway
defective cancers [13, 14]. Abrogation of the Chk1
dependent checkpoint should result in increased tumor cell
death. This approach should increase the therapeutic index
of a chemotherapeutic drug, as normal cells should remain
protected by their functional p53 pathway. This approach
is under evaluation with several small molecule inhibitors
of Chk1 in Phase I (AZD7762, PF-477736, GDC-0425
and GDC-0575) or Phase II (LY2603618 and MK-8776
(SCH 900776)) trials in combination with gemcitabine,
irinotecan, pemetrexed and cytarabine [15-18]. Chk1 may
also function in the mitotic spindle checkpoint [19] and the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Chk1 inhibitor PF-477736 has demonstrated potentiation
of docetaxel-induced efficacy in xenografts [20]. The
status of these clinical trials has been summarized [14, 21].
The present work describes the use of structureguided fragment evolution [22] in the identification and
subsequent pre-clinical characterization of V158411,
a novel, potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of
Chk1. V158411 potently inhibited Chk1 and Chk2
kinases and abrogated DNA damage induced S- and
G2-phase checkpoints. The in vitro cytotoxicity of
gemcitabine, cisplatin, SN38 and camptothecin was
potentiated by V158411 in p53 deficient, but not in p53
proficient, human tumor cell lines. In vivo, V158411
exhibited good pharmacokinetic properties, showed
minimal toxicity and potentiated the anti-tumor activity
of irinotecan in human tumor xenograft models without
additional systemic effects. These results demonstrate
the potential of combining V158411 with standard of
care chemotherapeutic agents to enhance the therapeutic
efficacy of these agents, without increasing their toxicity
to normal cells.

RESULTS
Identification and elaboration of a fragment core
using structure guided drug design to generate a
novel series of potent Chk1 inhibitors
The commercially available benzimidazole-1Hpyridin-2-one fragment (VER-154637) was identified as
a weak, but ligand efficient, binder to the Chk1 kinase
(Figure 1A, IC50 ≈ 100 μM, LE > 0.30). The X-ray
structure of VER-154637 bound to the ATP-binding site
of Chk1 showed that the two rings of the fragment were
coplanar and made the expected hydrogen-bonds with
the hinge motif of the kinase domain (Figure 2A). The
benzimidazole core was replaced by an isomorphous
indole ring, with the possible advantage that there is only
one possible tautomer for the polar hydrogen of the indole
ring. The indolyl-pyridone core bound to Chk1 like the
parent fragment, and formed the basis for subsequent
molecular modeling and compound elaboration.
The crystal structure (Figure 2A) demonstrated
that substituents added at the pyridone position 6 (Figure
1A) would likely clash with the Chk1 gatekeeper residue
Leu84. Conversely, the indole vectors C5─H and C6─H
point towards a solvent-exposed part of the bindingsite, with limited opportunities for tight contacts with
the protein. In addition, computational conformational
analysis suggested that derivatization from the indole
position 3 or the pyridone position 4 would sterically
twist those rings out of coplanarity, in turn disrupting
hydrogen-bonds to the kinase hinge. Thus, the initial
chemistry efforts concentrated on growing the fragment at

the pyridone position 5. The corresponding C5─H vector
was in the vicinity of the three buried water molecules,
which are usually conserved in X-ray structures of Chk1.
Molecular modeling suggested that the well-defined
orientation of the Chk1 side-chains and backbone around
these water molecules probably results in a particular
predominant hydrogen-bond network between the waters

and residues Glu55, Asn59, Val68, Asp148 and Phe149
(Figure 2A). It implies a strong orientational preference
for these water molecules, such that the water closest to
the ligand would act mostly as a hydrogen-bond donor
towards the compound. Modeling suggested that an
amide linker grafted on the pyridone position 5 would
offer its carbonyl group as hydrogen-bond acceptor

complementary to the hydrogen-bond donor character of
the contacting water (Figure 2A-2B). This prediction was
born out crystallographically, following the introduction
of a small amide at the C-5 pyridin-2-one (VER-154931,
Figure 2B). VER-154931 was a low μM inhibitor which

maintained the ligand efficiency of the parent fragment.
The amide nitrogen offered the opportunity to grow
towards the largely buried and structurally restrained sidechain amino group of Lys38 (Figure 2B). To this end, the
amide linker was extended with several hydrogen-bond-

accepting groups of approximately the desired length.
A methylated pyrazole was shown to bridge to Lys38
by X-ray crystallography, although with a disappointing
affinity (VER-155175, Figure 2C). Yet, benzylation of the
pyrazole led to a potency breakthrough (VER-155422,
IC50 0.017 μM, LE 0.35). The X-ray structure of VER155422 bound to Chk1 (Figure 2D) showed that the
benzyl tucks underneath the flexible glycine loop, burying
the apolar benzyl away from water, which presumably
explains the associated affinity gain. It was then noted that
reversing the intramolecular direction of the amide linker
could maintain its hydrogen-bond with the conserved
water, while also keeping the desired compound length for
binding to Lys38. Inversion of the amide linker in VER155991 (Figure 2E) gave a 2-fold increase in potency (IC50
0.0076 μM).
Much of the subsequent medicinal chemistry
concentrated on improving the compounds physicochemical and ADMET properties. This was done by
varying substituents at the solvent-exposed 5 position of
the indole ring which, from a structural point of view, can
tolerate a broad range of substituents, largely unhindered
from specific interactions with the protein. No attempt was
made to design compounds which would be selective for
Chk1 over Chk2. This led to V158411 (Figure 2F), which
had the desired kinase selectivity profile and showed
promising biological activity.

are detectable, but this is rapidly increased in HT29 cells
treated with etoposide (Figure 3A). V158411 reduced
pChk1 (S296) and pChk2 (S516) levels in a concentration
dependent fashion in cells treated with etoposide with IC50s
of 48 nM for Chk1 and 904 nM for Chk2; i.e. a cellular
selectivity of 19-fold for Chk1 versus Chk2. Inhibition
of Chk1 following DNA damage leads to checkpoint
failure, an increase in DNA strand breaks and subsequent
activation of H2AX via phosphorylation on S139, a marker
of DNA strand breaks [24, 25]. Using an ELISA assay
specific for pH2AX (S139), V158411 in combination with
gemcitabine induced H2AX phosphorylation with an EC50
of 51 nM, in close agreement with its ability to suppress
Chk1 auto-phosphorylation. Treatment of HT29 cells with
either gemcitabine or camptothecin likewise led to an
increase in pChk1 (S296) that could be effectively blocked
by V158411 in a concentration dependent fashion (Figure
3B) with complete ablation achieved at concentrations of
V158411 between 100 and 200 nM. Abrogation of Chk1
phosphorylation correlated with increased phosphorylation
of Histone H2AX on S139. Maximal induction of H2AX
phosphorylation, as determined by western blotting,
occurred at concentrations between 100 and 200 nM
V158411. In cell culture, V158411 appeared to exhibit
a long residency time on the Chk1 protein. Treatment of
HT29 cells with V158411 for 1 hour resulted in Chk1
inhibition (as measured by phosphorylation of Chk1 at
S296) for at least 24 hours after the removal of V158411
from the culture media (Figure 3C). Treatment of HT29
cells with camptothecin followed 16 hours later by a 2
hour pulse of V158411 followed by a 22 hour washout
period resulted in the same degree of Chk1 inhibition
and induction of pH2AX (S139) as a continual exposure
to V158411 (Figure 3D) for 24 hours. DNA damage
induced by cytotoxic drugs such as gemcitabine or
camptothecin activates cell cycle checkpoints and cell
cycle arrest. These changes are detectable by measuring
the expression levels and phosphorylation status of cell
cycle proteins. The arrest of cells in S- or G2/M phase
by gemcitabine and camptothecin was evidenced by the
increase in Cdc2 Y15 phosphorylation and cyclin B1
levels and a decrease in Histone H3 phosphorylation
(pHH3 (S10) (Figure 3B). V158411 was able to alleviate
this cell cycle block decreasing Cdc2 phosphorylation and
cyclin B1 levels as wells as increasing pHH3 (S10) in a
concentration dependent manner. Abrogation of these cell
cycle blocks correlated closely with decreased Chk1 S296
phosphorylation and increased H2AX phosphorylation
(Figure 3B). Similar results were obtained in Colo205 and
SW620 cells treated with gemcitabine or camptothecin
(Supplementary Figure 1). In these two cell lines,
V158411 reduced gemcitabine and camptothecin induced
S296 Chk1 phosphorylation and increased S139 H2AX
phosphorylation. These changes correlated with a
decrease in Cdc2 Y15 phosphorylation and an increase in
pHH3 (S10). These results provide strong evidence that

V158411 is a potent and selective inhibitor of
checkpoint kinases
V158411 potently inhibited the kinase activity of
full length Chk1 and Chk2 with IC50s of 4.4 and 4.5 nM
respectively and, importantly, was more than 10 000fold selective for CDK1 (Figure 1B). Selectivity against
the cell cycle kinase CDK1 is considered critical for the
pharmacological activity of Chk1 inhibitors as inhibiting
it would prevent the G2 checkpoint abrogation and entry
into mitosis; critical for the potentiation of cytotoxic DNA
damage [23]. Against a panel of 386 kinases in a wide
panel binding assay, V158411 inhibited the activity of
one kinase (Chk1) in the range 99-100%, three kinases
90-99% and 19 kinases 65-90% at 50 nM (Supplementary
Table 1). V158411 demonstrated little activity as a single
agent against a panel of human cancer cell lines inhibiting
cell proliferation with GI50s between 0.50 and 9.5 μM
(Supplementary Table 2).

inhibition of Chk1 with V158411 results in abrogation of
cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damaging agents and
increased DNA damage.
The ability of V158411 to abrogate gemcitabine
induced S-phase arrest was further characterized using
a checkpoint abrogation assay. Cells were pre-treated

with gemcitabine for 16 hours followed by increasing
concentrations of V158411 in the presence of nocodazole,
an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization, for a further
24 hours. Mitotic cells were then scored for pHH3
(S10) expression. p53 defective HT29 cells exposed
to gemcitabine, which induces arrest in S-phase, were

negative for pHH3 (S10) staining. V158411 treatment
abrogated the gemcitabine induced S-phase arrest
allowing cells to progress through into mitosis where they
were trapped by nocodazole. These cells stained positive
for pHH3 and are indicative of checkpoint abrogation.
V158411 abrogated the gemcitabine induced S-phase
arrest with an EC50 of 79 nM and maximal abrogation at
around 300 nM (Figure 1B).

The combination of 100 mg/kg intraperitoneal irinotecan,
followed 2 hours later by 30 mg/kg intravenous V158411,
had no major effect on the plasma pharmacokinetics of
irinotecan and SN38 (Figure 5B). Conversion of irinotecan
to SN38 was not affected by the combination dosing. Coadministration of irinotecan and V158411 resulted in a
small decrease in the clearance and subsequent increase
in the exposure of V158411 (2.2 fold increase in AUClast).
The mechanism underlying this effect is unknown. A
pharmacokinetic study in HT29 tumor bearing mice
demonstrated that V158411 rapidly distributes out of
the plasma into the tumor. Following IV administration
at 30 mg/kg, V158411 has a low plasma clearance (24
mL/min/kg) and a moderate volume of distribution (2.5
L/kg), resulting in a long half-life (4.1 h). V158411
rapidly distributes out of the blood and into tissues:
tumor exposure was considerably higher than plasma as
quantified by a tissue/ plasma AUC0-24h ratio of 4.7. In the
tumor, V158411 has a considerably longer elimination
half-life (22 hours) than observed in the plasma (Figure
5C).

V158411 potentiates cytotoxic agents in p53
defective cancer cell lines
The ability of V158411 to potentiate the cytotoxicity
of a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed across
a panel of cell lines. V158411 potentiated the growth
inhibitory activity of a wide variety of chemotherapeutic
agents across a panel of p53 defective but not p53proficient cell lines (Figure 4A and 4B). The agents
tested are representative of chemotherapeutic agents
currently in clinical use with differing modes of action
including antimetabolites (gemcitabine), topoisomerase
I inhibitors (camptothecin and SN38) and platinating
agents (cisplatin). The concentration of V158411 used
to potentiate the cytotoxic activity of these agents had no
activity as a single agent (Supplementary Table 2). As has
been seen with other Chk1 inhibitors [15, 16, 26, 27], the
most robust potentiation was observed with gemcitabine.
With gemcitabine, V158411 decreased the overall cell
viability, in addition to reducing the GI50 of gemcitabine.
The ability of V158411 to increase the cytotoxicity
of gemcitabine, camptothecin or SN38 was confirmed
using colony formation assays. Treatment of HT29 cells
with gemcitabine, camptothecin or SN38 in combination
with V158411 significantly increased the fraction of
cells killed by all three agents (Figure 4C). Comparison
of two different dosing regimens, co-dosing or cytotoxic
agent followed by V158411, indicated little schedule
dependence for camptothecin or SN38. However, for
gemcitabine, schedule dependence was observed.
Sequential administration of V158411 24 hours after
gemcitabine appeared more effective than co-treatment.

V158411 potentiates the anti-tumor activity of
irinotecan in human xenograft models
Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of V158411
and the need to combine with a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
agent, a once weekly IV dosing schedule was initially
selected. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of V158411
as a single agent was determined following administration
of 60 to 100 mg/kg q7d for 21 days to female nude mice
in groups of five animals (Figure 6A). V158411 had no
effect on body weight loss, and no treatment related deaths
occurred at doses up to 100 mg/kg. Higher doses could not
be tested due to compound solubility and dosing volume
limitations. V158411 caused some acute, dose-related
effects (flushing, tachycardia, exophthalmos) that were
self-limiting and could be minimized by administering
the compound by slow infusion. We further confirmed
that V158411 did not increase the systemic toxicity of
the cytotoxic agent irinotecan in nu/nu mice. Irinotecan
is a pro-drug of SN38, which inhibits the activity of
topoisomerase I, and a semi-synthetic analogue of
camptothecin and is currently used clinically for the
treatment of colon cancer. Administration of the MTD of
irinotecan in combination with doses of V158411 up to
100 mg/kg did not result in increased irinotecan toxicity
(Figure 6A).
The ability of V158411 to potentiate the anti-tumor
efficacy of irinotecan in vivo was assessed in mouse colon
carcinoma xenograft models. Colo205 tumor bearing mice
were treated with combinations of irinotecan and V158411
once weekly for 3 weeks until the mean tumor volume
reached 750 mm3 or 60 days post the first treatment had
elapsed. In the absence of any treatments, the median

In vivo pharmacokinetics of V158411 in preclinical
species
Administration of V158411 to three pre-clinical
species resulted in comparable plasma pharmacokinetics
following a single IV bolus of 10 mg/kg. In all three
species V158411 demonstrated low plasma clearance and
moderate volumes of distribution resulting in reasonably
long plasma half-lives (Figure 5A). The pharmacokinetics
of irinotecan, its’ active metabolite SN38, and V158411,
were determined in mice following single doses and in
combination. The combination dose regimen mimicked an
efficacious dosing regimen from xenograft studies in vivo.

time to endpoint (TTE) was 19.8 days (Figure 6B).
Treatment with 60 mg/kg V158411 monotherapy was
inactive with a median TTE of 22.3 days. In comparison,
75 mg/kg irinotecan monotherapy significantly reduced
tumor growth compared to vehicle alone (P < 0.001). The
median TTE was extended to 35.4 days equating to a 79%
tumor growth delay (TGD). Addition of 30 mg/kg or 60
mg/kg V158411 2 hours post 75 mg/kg irinotecan to the
treatment regimen significantly decreased tumor burden
and slowed time to endpoint compared to irinotecan
therapy alone (Figure 6B). In the mice treated with 30
mg/kg V158411, the median TTE was extended to 45.4
days corresponding to a 129% TGD (P < 0.01). At 60 mg/
kg V158411, the median TTE was further extended to 60
days with a 203% TGD (P < 0.001, Figure 6C). There
was no additional systemic toxicity associated with the

combination therapy with no animal deaths observed and
a mean body weight nadir on day 4 of -2.7% (Figure 6B).
The potentiation of irinotecan anti-tumor efficacy
by V158411 was confirmed in a SW620 colorectal mouse
xenograft model. This model grows more rapidly than
the Colo205 model, reaching a median tumor volume of
1500 mm3 (the endpoint in these studies) in 13.3 days.
V158411 did not inhibit tumor growth in this model
when administered as a monotherapy. Administration
of irinotecan on a once weekly for 3 weeks schedule
significantly reduced SW620 tumor growth with a median
TTE of 24.1 days (P < 0.001) equating to a TGD of
81% and 75% respectively (Figure 6C). V158411, when
administered at 30 or 60 mg/kg 2 hours after irinotecan
significantly increased the tumor growth delay compared
to irinotecan therapy alone. Median TTEs were increased

DISCUSSION

to 28.8 and 35.1 days for 30 and 60 mg/kg V158411
respectively (Figure 6C) equating to 117 and 154% TGD
(P < 0.01). Irinotecan and the combination treatment
were again well tolerated in the SW620 animal model.
The mean body weight nadir for irinotecan alone was
-8.6% on day 4 and -13.3% on day 5 for the combination
group with 60 mg/kg V158411. No treatment-related
animal deaths were observed in any treatment group.
In summary, a single IV dose of V158411 administered
2 hours after irinotecan significantly increased the antitumor activity of irinotecan in two different human colon
cancer xenograft models without increasing the systemic
toxicity of irinotecan.

Chk1 is a key component of the DNA damage
response pathway and is activated in response to intrinsic
DNA damage induced by normal cellular processes such
as replication fork collapse or in response to DNA damage
induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. Chk1
inhibitors represent a new molecularly targeted class of
chemopotentiators that could increase the therapeutic
activity of standard of care cytotoxic drugs whilst sparing
the normal tissues from increased systemic toxicity. This
hypothesis is currently being tested in the clinic with the
IV inhibitors LY2603618 (Phase II) and MK-8776 (Phase
II) and the oral inhibitors GDC-0425 and GDC-0575 (both
Phase I) [28, 29] (http://clinicaltrials.gov/).

V158411 is a novel inhibitor of the Chk1 kinase
discovered through structure-based elaboration of a
fragment core designed for binding at a kinase ATPbinding site. In an in vitro assay against recombinant
human Chk1, V158411 inhibited the phosphorylation of a
substrate peptide with an IC50 of 4.4 nM. This is below the
lower theoretical limit of the assay (6.25 nM, half enzyme
concentration in the assay) suggesting that V158411 may
inhibit Chk1 with greater potency than detected in this
assay. Cross screening against the functionally related
Chk2 kinase revealed little selectivity between Chk1 and
Chk2 at the enzyme level. The clinical and therapeutic
relevance of inhibiting Chk2 is still unclear [30] and Chk1
versus Chk2 selective (PF-477736 and MK-8776) [16,
17] and non-selective (AZD7762) [15] inhibitors have
undergone clinical evaluation. Against a wide panel of
diverse kinases, V158411 exhibited > 100-fold selectivity
for Chk1 over the majority of the kinases in the panel
at pharmacologically relevant doses. Selectivity against
the cell cycle kinase CDK1 (> 10 000-fold selective) is
considered critical for the pharmacological activity of
Chk1 inhibitors as inhibiting it would prevent the G2
checkpoint abrogation and entry into mitosis; critical for
the potentiation of cytotoxic DNA damage [23]. V158411
exhibited very little single agent activity against a diverse
panel of human cancer cell lines inhibiting proliferation
with GI50s in the range 0.5 to 9.5 µM, further evidence of
the selectivity of V158411 for Chk1 kinase.
Chk1 and Chk2 undergo autophosphorylation on
serine 296 and on serine 516 respectively in response to
DNA damage [9, 31, 32]. In HT29 colon cancer cells,
V158411 blocked etoposide induced autophosphorylation
of Chk1 with an IC50 of 48 nM and Chk2 with an IC50
of 904 nM suggesting that the apparent selectivity of
V158411 for Chk1 over Chk2 is closer to 19-fold in
cells. This difference in selectivity cannot be attributed to
differences in the ATP Km and is likely due to the kinases
being present in dynamic, multi-protein complexes. This
highlights the risk of relying solely on isolated enzyme
assays to determine kinase selectivity.
Abrogation of gemcitabine induced cell cycle arrest
was determined using a high content assay to measure
mitotic cells following trapping with nocodazole and flow
cytometry. In both assays, V158411 inhibited gemcitabine
induced checkpoint activation in a concentration range
that correlated closely with inhibition of Chk1 kinase
activity (as determined by inhibition of Chk1 S296
phosphorylation). Abrogation of DNA damage induced
cell cycle checkpoints resulted in increased DNA damage
as determined by an increase in H2AX phosphorylation on
S139. This increase in H2AX phosphorylation correlated
with Chk1 kinase inhibition and DNA damage induced
checkpoint abrogation. The IC50 for inhibition of Chk1
autophosphorylation and the EC50 for induction of H2AX
phosphorylation by V158411 was around 10-fold lower
in HT29 cells than the single agent GI50 suggesting that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

achieving a reasonable therapeutic index should be
possible. The ability of V158411 to potentiate the in vitro
cytotoxicity of a range of cytotoxic agents of differing
mechanism of actions was determined in a panel of
p53 wild type and mutant cancer cell lines. Substantial
potentiation of the anti-tumor activity of gemcitabine
(anti-metabolite), camptothecin and SN38 (topoisomerase
I inhibitors), and cisplatin (DNA alkylator) by V158411
was observed in all five p53 mutant cancer cell lines but
not in the three p53 wild type cell lines. Whilst we have
been unable to conduct studies on isogenic cell lines, these
results suggest that the enhanced cytotoxicity observed
with V158411 will be dependent on the p53 status.
Previous studies have suggested p53 mutant status to be
important for the overall response to combinations with
some agents but does not predict synergy in all cases [26].
This further supports the notion that V158411 should have
a good therapeutic index in man. As has been observed
with other Chk1 inhibitors [15, 16, 26, 27] gemcitabine
cytotoxicity was potentiated the greatest by V158411.
Interestingly, this was the only chemotherapeutic agent
where V158411 not only increased the anti-proliferative
effect (as determined by a decrease in GI50) but reduced
the viability of the cells treated with the cytotoxic agent.
Whether gemcitabine is the best drug to combine with
Chk1 inhibitors in the clinic still remains to be determined.
When administered via the intravenous route,
V158411 exhibited good plasma exposure and a high
volume of distribution resulting in a reasonable half-life of
4.1 hours. V158411 rapidly distributed to tumors resulting
in higher exposure than in the plasma with an AUC ratio of
4.7. Selective retention of V158411 in the tumor resulted
in a longer elimination half-life of 22 hours and extended
tumor exposure. Comparable pharmacokinetic properties
were observed across the three pre-clinical toxicology
species (mouse, rat and dog) studied. In combination
pharmacokinetic studies, V158411 did not alter the
exposure or metabolism of either irinotecan or its active
metabolite SN38 suggesting that any increased efficacy
observed between irinotecan and V158411 is not due to a
drug-drug interaction.
When administered either once or twice weekly as
an IV bolus, V158411 showed minimal toxicity at doses up
to 100 mg/kg. Doses beyond this could not be investigated
due to dosing volume and V158411 solubility limitations,
and the maximum tolerated dose of V158411 has yet to
be found. Administration of V158411 in combination
with the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan did not
affect the toxicity of irinotecan. The long tumor half-life
of V158411 predicted that a single IV dose of V158411
should be sufficient to potentiate the anti-tumor activity
of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents in vivo. Dose
dependent potentiation of irinotecan therapy was observed
in two colon cancer models. In these models, V158411 was
administered as a single IV bolus 2 hours after irinotecan
therapy. Further studies identified a window of between
35808

Cell culture and cytotoxicity assay

2 and 24 hours after irinotecan as being optimal for the
administration of V158411 in order to obtain therapeutic
benefit (data not shown). Importantly, V158411 exhibited
no single agent activity in either Colo205 or SW620
tumor bearing mice. The ability to administer a single IV
infusion of a Chk1 inhibitor closely after administration of
a cytotoxic agent could have significant patient benefits.
Such a regimen would reduce the amount of time spent by
the patient at the hospital and hopefully improve patient
compliance. To the best of our knowledge, V158411 is
the only Chk1 inhibitor under pre-clinical development
with such an in vivo activity profile. All other inhibitors in
development either require multiple doses to see efficacy
or require administration 24 hours after the cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic agent [27, 33, 34].
In summary, these preclinical studies demonstrate
that V158411 is a potent, selective inhibitor of Chk1 that,
in vivo, is well tolerated and enhances the anti-tumor
activity of irinotecan therapy with a schedule that will
be easily transferable to the clinic. These observations
suggest that further clinical evaluation of V158411 is
warranted.

All cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and maintained as low passage stocks.
Cells were routinely cultured in DMEM or RPMI1640
containing 10% FCS and 1% penicillin / streptomycin
(Invitrogen). The cytotoxicity of V158411 was determined
following exposure of cells in 96 well plates using a
10-point titration for 72 hours. Cell proliferation was
determined using sulphorhodamine B staining following
protein precipitation with 10% TCA.

pH2AX ELISA
1 x 104 HT29 cells were seeded per well of a 96 well
plate and treated with a combination of 50 nM gemcitabine
plus increasing concentrations of V158411 for 24 hours.
Following fixation with methanol, pH2AX was detected
with a mouse monoclonal antibody (JBW301, Millipore)
and a europium-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody.

Antibodies and western blotting

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Anti-pHistone H3 (S10) was obtained from
Millipore; pCdc2 (Y15), pCdc25C (S216), Chk1, pChk1
(S317), pChk2 (S516), Cyclin B1, pH2AX (S139),
GAPDH and Actin from Cell Signaling Technologies and
pChk1 (S296) from Abcam. Treated and untreated cells
were washed once with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer
containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Protein concentration was determined using BCA
kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of lysate were separated by
SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis conducted using the

Synthesis of V158411
V158411 was synthesized according to Scheme
1 (Figure 7). A detailed description of the synthesis of
V158411 can be found in the supplemental information.

X-ray crystallography
X-ray crystallography was as previously described
[35]. In brief, structures were obtained following soaking
of apo Chk1 crystals at 18°C for 16 hours. Diffraction data
was collected at the DLS synchrotron (Oxfordshire, UK)
at the I02 beamline, equipped with the ADSC Q315 ccd
detector. PDB ID: 5DLS (www.rcsb.org).

Potentiation assays
5 x 103 cells per well were seeded in 96-well
plates and incubated overnight. Cells were treated with
a 10-point titration of gemcitabine, camptothecin, SN38
or cisplatin in the presence of a fixed concentration of
V158411 for 72 hours. The effect on cell proliferation was
determined using a CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (MTS, Promega).

Molecular modeling
Compound modelling was performed with software
from CCG (http://www.chemcomp.com/) and from
Schrödinger (http://www.schrodinger.com/).

Clonogenicity assay

In vitro kinase assays

HT29 cells were plated at a density of 300 cells per
well in 6-well plates and allowed to attach for 4 hours.
Cells were treated with gemcitabine, camptothecin or
SN38 in the absence or presence of V158411 for 24
hours followed by drug free media for a further 14 days.
Resulting colonies were stained and fixed with 0.1%

In vivo studies

Xenograft models in athymic nude mice
Animals

Xenograft studies were undertaken by Charles
River Laboratories Discovery Services, North Carolina.
On the day of tumor cell implant, Colo205 cells were
harvested and resuspended in 50% Matrigel matrix (BD
Biosciences) in PBS at a concentration of 5 x 106 cells/mL.
Each test mouse received 1 x 106 Colo205 cells implanted
subcutaneously (SC) in the flank of female athymic
nude mice (HRLN or NCr nu/nu), and tumor growth
was monitored as the average size approached 100-150
mm3. The SW620 tumor line was maintained by serial SC
transplantation in female athymic nude mice (HRLN nu/
nu). Tumor fragments, approximately 1 mm3 each, were
implanted SC into the right flank of each animal and
allowed to grow towards a target size of 100-150 mm3. On
day 1 of the study, tumors were randomized into treatment
groups before compound administration.

Animals were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories or Harlan. All procedures were conducted
in accordance with the Institute for Laboratory Animal
Research Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (USA) or Guidance on the Operation of the
Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (UK).

Pharmacokinetics of V158411
Dosing of animals and collection of samples was
conducted by Quotient Bioresearch (Rushden) Ltd, UK.
V158411 was administered by intravenous (IV) bolus
injection to female Balb/C mice, male Sprague-Dawley
rats or male beagle dogs. Plasma samples were prepared
by protein precipitation with acetonitrile containing
internal standard (IS; dextromethorphan, 0.5 μg/mL); the
analysis plate was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes
at 4°C. Calibration lines (1-5,000 ng/mL) were prepared in
plasma for quantitation of V158411, irinotecan and SN38.
Supernatant was analyzed by liquid chromatography
combined with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
for V158411, irinotecan, SN38 and dextromethorphan. The
ratios of analyte against IS peak areas were calculated, and
concentrations derived from calibration lines generated by
Quanlynx (Waters Ltd.).

Antitumor efficacy studies
Irinotecan (Camptostar, Pharmacia and Upjohn)
was diluted in 5% dextrose in deionised water (D5W) and
administered via the intraperitoneal (IP) route. V158411
was formulated in D5W and administered via IV injection
into the tail vein. Cyclic treatment regimens were followed
and treatment ranged from 2-3 cycles. MTD (100 mg/kg)
irinotecan was administered once per week for 3 weeks
in combination with V158411 2 or 24 hours after the
irinotecan dose.
Tumor size was measured with electronic calipers
and tumor volume calculated according to the formula
((width x width) x length) /2.
The study endpoint was defined as a tumor volume
of 750 mm3 for Colo205 or 1500 mm3 for SW620, or day
60, whichever came first. Each animal was euthanized
when its' tumor reached this endpoint. The time to
endpoint (TTE) for each mouse was calculated from the
equation TTE = (log10(endpoint volume)-b)/m where b is the
intercept and m the slope of the line obtained by linear
regression of a log-transformed tumor growth data set.
Animals that did not reach the end point were assigned a
TTE value equal to the last day of the study.

Calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters
Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using
the software package WinNonLin (Pharsight Corp.).
Data was analyzed using noncompartmental analysis
and fitted using plasma concentration versus time curves.
Irinotecan and SN38 - non-compartmental model 200,
linear trapezoidal (Linear Interpolation) method; V158411
- non-compartmental model 201, linear trapezoidal (Linear

Tolerability of V158411
Tolerability studies were undertaken by Charles
River Laboratories Discovery Services, North Carolina in
female HRLN nu/nu mice. Animals were weighed daily
for the first five days then twice weekly thereafter for the
duration of the study. The mice were observed frequently
for overt signs of any adverse, treatment-related side
effects, and clinical signs of toxicity recorded. Toxicity
