ABSTRACT
Bone homeostasis critically relies on the RANKL-RANK-OPG axis which can be
targeted by the fully human monoclonal antibody denosumab in conditions with
increased bone resporption such as bone metastases. The binding site and therefore
the molecular mechanism by which this antibody inhibits RANKL has not been
characterized so far. Here, we used random peptide phage display library screenings
to identify the denosumab epitope on RANKL. Alignments of phage derived peptide
sequences with RANKL suggested that this antibody recognized a linear epitope
between position T233 and Y241. Mutational analysis confirmed the core residues as
critical for this interaction. The spatial localization of this epitope on a 3-dimensional
model of RANKL showed that it overlapped with the major binding sites of OPG and
RANK on RANKL. We conclude that denosumab inhibits RANKL by both functional and
molecular mimicry of the natural decoy receptor OPG.

INTRODUCTION

recently been solved by co-crystallization [3-5]. At the
molecular level, soluble or membrane-anchored RANKL
forms a homotrimer [6, 7] that either trimerizes the RANK
receptor inducing downstream signaling [8] or interacts
with three OPG monomers [3], which prevent further
interaction with RANK. In osteoporosis as well as in
many solid tumors with bone metastases this equilibrium
of RANKL, RANK and OPG is tilted towards increased
levels of RANKL leading to bone resorption, pathological
fractures and pain.
Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal RANKL
directed antibody, prevents RANK receptor binding
thereby decreasing osteoclast induced bone resorption.
It is approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [9], for the prevention of skeletal-

Bone health relies on homeostasis of bone
formation and resorption which is critically regulated
by the receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand
(RANKL), its signaling receptor RANK and its decoy
receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG) [1]. The binding of
osteoblast-derived RANKL to RANK expressed by
osteoclast precursors promotes osteoclast differentiation
and activation [2]. OPG is secreted by osteoblasts and
has a very similar architecture as the RANK ectodomain
[3]. It acts as a decoy receptor by binding RANKL and
thereby prevents osteoclastogenesis. The structures of the
RANKL-RANK and the RANKL-OPG complexes have

related events in patients with bone metastases [10-12] and
as a preventive measure in patients undergoing hormonedeprivation in the treatment of breast and prostate cancer
[13, 14]. New potential fields of application continue to
arise such as the prevention of metastatic spread to the
bone [1]. Despite its widespread clinical application, the
precise binding site of denosumab has remained unknown.
Here, we set out to determine the denosumab
epitope on RANKL to explore its mechanism of action at
the molecular level. Since OPG serves as a natural decoy
receptor for RANKL, we wished to establish the spatial
relationship between the antibody’s epitope, the OPG
binding site and the critical residues for RANK binding
on RANKL.

Random peptide phage display library screenings
reveal a peptide motif specifically binding to
denosumab
Linear 12mer and cyclic 7mer random peptide
phage display libraries were screened on denosumab
for epitope-mimicking peptides. Over three consecutive
panning rounds, selectively binding phage were enriched
(Figure 1A). Subsequently, single phage clones interacting
specifically with denosumab were identified (Figure
1B). Overall, the sequenced phage clones showed a
common consensus motif (Table 1). The most dominant
clone CTHYMQLAC which made up 50% of sequences
displayed strongest binding to denosumab and was
therefore considered to mimic most reliably the presumed
denosumab epitope on RANKL.

Denosumab epitope-mimicking peptides are
homologous to a linear peptide strand on RANKL

either a linear or conformational epitope. The software
suggested a high degree of homology to a linear strand
between T233 and Y241 of the protein. The presumed
antibody’s epitope sequence not only shared sequence
homology to the most dominant epitope mimic but also
to most of the remaining epitope mimics identified by our

Therefore, we cloned and expressed the wt RANKL
protein in its membrane-bound form in eukaryotic
293T cells by lentiviral transduction. Both a polyclonal
RANKL antibody and denosumab bound selectively to
the transfected 293T cells (Figure 2). The core amino
acid positions L336/Q237/L238 of the presumed epitope
were then mutated to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis
using the primers displayed in Supplementary Table

1. While a polyclonal RANKL directed antibody still
recognized mutant RANKL, suggesting that the protein
was displayed correctly on the cell surface, binding of
denosumab to mutant RANKL was completely abrogated
(Figure 2). In the RANKL control mutant (R191A/G192A/
W193A), denosumab binding was preserved (Figure 2).
This mutational analysis substantiated our hypothesis
that (233)TEYLQLMVY(241) is the epitope targeted by
denosumab.

motif with RANKL suggested that the antibody targets a
short linear epitope which could be confirmed by binding
studies of mutant RANKL. Interestingly, we found that
the epitope overlaps with critical amino acids within the
previously characterized binding sites of OPG and RANK
on RANKL. Importantly, denosumab targets amino acid
residues located in one of the two OPG binding sites
previously identified by co-cristallization [3]. This binding
site II has been found to be especially critical for OPG
binding and largely overlaps with the RANK-RANKL
interaction site underlining the significance of this region
for therapeutic targeting.
In addition to complementing our knowledge about
ligand-receptor-antibody interactions, our data may
be seen in the context of novel (preventive) targeting
strategies for osteopenic conditions. Since the currently
established passive targeting with RANKL directed
antibody warrants continuous antibody application, direct
immunization using immunogenic peptides which mimic
RANKL peptide strands involved in RANK recognition
could be an attractive alternative treatment strategy. Our
peptide CTHYMQLAC may be suitable for this purpose
since it mimics the denosumab epitope proven to be
appropriate for therapeutic targeting. Such approaches,
however, have to bear in mind potential pitfalls such
as the natural tolerance of the immune system towards
self proteins and the pronounced immunosuppression in
patients with advanced cancer possibly impairing efficient
humoral immune responses.
Taken together, these data reveal the structural basis
for the inhibition of RANKL by denosumab and show that
this therapeutic antibody functionally and molecularly
mimics the naturally occuring RANKL antagonist OPG.

Critical amino acid residues of the denosumab
epitope overlap with the major binding site II of
OPG on RANKL
Since RANKL has been crystallized in complex
with OPG (structural model shown in Figure 3A) and the
two binding sites of this natural antagonist of RANKL
are known, we wished to explore the spatial relationship
between the denosumab epitope and the OPG binding site
on RANKL. We therefore displayed both OPG interaction
sites on a 3-dimensional model of RANKL (Figure 3B).
Interestingly, we found that the denosumab epitope
overlapped with the major binding site (binding site II) of
OPG on RANKL which corresponds to the major binding
site of the RANK receptor on RANKL (Figure 3C). This
suggested that denosumab mimics the natural decoy
receptor OPG at the molecular level and thereby prevents
RANK binding and subsequent bone loss.

DISCUSSION
The RANKL-RANK-OPG molecular triad critically
regulates bone homeostasis and is therefore considered
an attractive target for the treatment of osteopenic
conditions. While a number of potential targeting
approaches are under investigation (RANK-Fc, OPGFc, OPG peptidomimetics, RANKL vaccination) [16],
the monoclonal RANKL inhibiting antibody denosumab
is currently the most established targeted agent and has
been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone
metastases. Moreover, denosumab prevents osteopenia in
patients undergoing hormone-deprivation therapy in breast
and prostate cancer and potential new fields of application
are currently under investigation.
Here, we analyzed the so far unexplored molecular
interaction between denosumab and RANKL by using
random peptide phage display library screenings.
This is an elegant technical tool to recover epitopemimicking peptide sequences, which may be used to
deduce the exact binding site of a given antibody within
the parental antigen. This technology is particularly
useful in identifying linear epitopes, but may also be
used to explore discontinuous, structural epitopes if
complemented with structural mapping software tools [15,
17, 18]. Alignment of our phage display derived peptide

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Random peptide phage display screening
The cyclic 7mer and linear 12mer libraries were
purchased from New England Biolabs. Screenings on
denosumab (Xgeva®, Amgen) were performed after twofold negative selection on polyclonal IgG (Intratect®,
Biotest) essentially as previously described [19-21].
Random clones were amplified after three selection rounds
and tested for selective binding to denosumab by Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as suggested
by the manufacturer. Selectively binding phage were
sequenced (Seqlab). Phage displaying the random peptide
YMTPPLSSQQKS were used as control.

CellQuestTMPro software (BD Biosciences, Version 5.2.1).

The MIMOX algorithm was used to align the most

3-dimensional models of the RANK-RANKLOPG-denosumab interaction

Cloning of membrane-bound RANKL into
lentiviral vector

The model of the human RANKL-OPG complex
was adapted from Luan et al. [3], the model of the murine
RANKL-RANK complex from Nelson et al. [4]. Pdbfiles were downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/structure. All illustrations were created with the
ViewerLite software (Accelrys®, Version 4.2).

Human RANKL cDNA (codon optimized for
eukaryotic expression) was purchased from Invitrogen,
digested with NotI (NEB) and EcoRI (NEB) and cloned
into the third-generation self-inactivating HIV-1 derived
lentiviral vector LeGO-iG3, a derivative of LeGO-iG2
[20]. The integrity of the fragment in the final vector was
verified by sequencing. LeGO-G2 encoding only enhanced
green fluorescent protein (eGFP) served as control.

Transduction of 293T cells
Viral particles were produced as cell-free
supernatants by transient transfection of 293T packaging
cells as described [22]. To generate cell lines stably
expressing the human RANKL wild-type (wt) or RANKL
mutants, 293T cells (ATCC® CRL-3216) were plated at a
density of 5×104 in 500 µl medium and transduced with
the corresponding lentiviral vector. The lentiviral vectors
LeGO-iG3-RANKL-wt, LeGO-iG3-RANKL-mutant and
the control vector LeGO-G2 were added to the cells at
equal multiplicity of infection to ensure comparable
transduction rates of about 60 to 80%, as determined
by FACS analysis. Transduced cells were maintained in
DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin/streptomycin.
