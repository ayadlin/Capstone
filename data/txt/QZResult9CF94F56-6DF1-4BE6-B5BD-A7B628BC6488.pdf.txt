Abstract
We have investigated interferon-κ (IFN-κ) regulation in the
context of human papillomavirus (HPV)–induced carcinogenesis using primary human foreskin keratinocytes (HFK),
immortalized HFKs encoding individual oncoproteins of
HPV16 (E6, E7, and E6/E7), and cervical carcinoma cells.
Here, IFN-κ was suppressed in the presence of E6, whereas
its expression was not affected in HFKs or E7-immortalized
HFKs. Transcription could be reactivated after DNA demethylation but was decreased again upon drug removal. Partial
reactivation could also be accomplished when E6 was
knocked down, suggesting a contribution of E6 in IFN-κ
de novo methylation. We identified a single CpG island near
the transcriptional start site as being involved in selective
IFN-κ expression. To prove the functional relevance of IFN-κ
in building up an antiviral response, IFN-κ was ectopically
expressed in cervical carcinoma cells where protection
against vesicular stomatitis virus–mediated cytolysis could
be achieved. Reconstitution of IFN-κ was accompanied by an
increase of p53, MxA, and IFN-regulatory factors, which was
reversed by knocking down either IFN-κ or p53 by small interfering RNA. This suggests the existence of a positive feedback
loop between IFN-κ, p53, and components of IFN signaling
pathway to maintain an antiviral state. Our in vitro findings
were further corroborated in biopsy samples of cervical cancer patients, in which IFN-κ was also downregulated when
compared with normal donor tissue. This is the first report
showing an epigenetic silencing of type I IFN after HPV16
oncogene expression and revealing a novel strategy on how
high-risk HPVs can abolish the innate immune response in
their genuine host cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(22):8718–25]

Introduction
It is currently well accepted that “high-risk” human papillomaviruses (HPV) are etiologically involved in the development of
cervical cancer (1). Although cancer can be induced by various
mechanisms, the immune system is a common and indispensable
border of defense against the development of malignant tumors.

According to the immunosurveillance concept of cancer (2), arising tumors are eradicated by immunologic effector cells or, conversely, immunocompromised individuals should exhibit higher
rates of malignancies (3). Indeed, population-based studies show
that immunodeficient women have a higher risk to get cervical
cancer than age-matched controls (4). This indicates that high-risk
HPVs take advantage of a dysfunctional innate and adaptive immunologic surveillance (4–6) to exert their tumorigenic potential.
Considering innate immune evasion strategies, several studies
claimed that viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 of high-risk HPVs can
potentially target type I interferon (IFN) signal transduction.
HPV18 E6 impairs Jak-STAT1/2 tyrosine phosphorylation (7),
whereas HPV16 E6 physically interacts with the IFN-regulatory factor (IRF)-3, a central transcription factor in the primary antiviral
response (8). However, there is still a matter of controversy because these results do not explain why exogenously added IFN-α
or IFN-β induces an antiviral state or why RNA virus infection can
activate IRF-3 and, in turn, an immediate-early IFN response in
cervical carcinoma cells despite E6 and E7 expression (9, 10).
Although much is known about the function of IFN-α/β in
innate and acquired immunity (11, 12), the role of IFN-κ in HPVmediated pathogenesis is still not defined. IFN-κ shows a very
restricted pattern of expression, which is mostly limited to keratinocytes but can be also detected in dendritic cells. IFN-κ strongly
binds to heparin, suggesting that it is retained at the local site of
production and activates signaling pathways by cell-to-cell contact
(13). Because human keratinocytes are the main targets of HPV
(1), we have studied the regulation of IFN-κ in the context of
HPV-induced carcinogenesis. Evidence is provided that in HPV16
E6-encoding cells, IFN-κ expression is suppressed by de novo methylation within a CpG-rich area near the transcriptional start site.
Conversely, ectopic expression of IFN-κ in cervical carcinoma cells
reconstitutes an antiviral state, which is accompanied by an increase of p53, IRFs, and MxA. Because IFN-κ is the only keratinocytespecific IFN involved in innate immunity, abrogation of this pathway
may represent an early and central key event in the development
of cervical cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell treatment. Primary human foreskin keratinocytes
(HFK) were immortalized with E6, E7, or E6/E7 oncogenes of HPV16
(14). Normal and HPV-positive HFKs were maintained in keratinocyte
growth medium. CaSki, SiHa, HeLa, and C33a cells were cultured as described (15). 5′-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-dAza-C; Calbiochem) was dissolved
in 50% acetic acid. Treatment was done using 2.5 to 10 μmol/L as indicated. Sodium butyrate (Sigma) was freshly dissolved in culture medium
and trichostatin A (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO (Merck).

IFN-κ Regulation in HPV16-Positive Cells
Cell extracts and Western blot analysis. Total cell extracts for
Western blot analyses were prepared as reported previously (16). Membranes were probed with the following antibodies: IFN-κ (Abnova); IRF-1,
IRF-7, and p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); IRF-9 (Transduction Laboratories); MxA (kindly obtained from Otto Haller, University Freiburg); and
actin (ICN Biomedicals).
RNA analysis and real-time PCR. Total RNA from cells or snap-frozen
biopsies was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). For reverse transcription, 1 μg DNase-treated RNA was prepared as described previously (9).
PCR was performed using the 2× green master mix (Promega) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. For PCR, the following IFN-κ primers
were used: sense 5′-ATGCTTGGAGGAAGACGAGA-3′ and antisense
5′-TTGCGTAGCCACAATCTCTG-3′. Conditions for IFN-κ PCR were as follows: 3 min at 94°C followed by 30 cycles for 30 s at 94°C, 1 min at 58°C, 30 s
at 72°C, and 10 min at 72°C. For HPV16, the following primers were used:
E6 sense 5′-ACTGCAATGTTTCAGGACCC-3′ and antisense 5′-TCAGGACACAGTGGCTTTTG-3′ and E7 sense 5′-CCCAGCTGTAATCATGCATG-3′ and
antisense 5′-TGCCCATTAACAGGTCTTCC-3′. PCR was performed as
mentioned above using an annealing temperature of 60°C. Glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) primers were sense 5′-TGGATATTGTT ‐
GCCATCAATGACC-3′ and antisense 5′-GATGGCATGGACTGTGGTCATG-3′;
amplification was made at 65°C. The PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels.
Quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative PCR was performed using a
TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan-specific
probes for IFN-κ (Hs00737883-m1) and TATA box binding protein
(Hs00427620-m1; Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, quantitative PCR was carried out using a real-time PCR
(RT-PCR) system (ABI PRISM 7700; Applied Biosystems). The data correspond to the mean from three independent experiments, normalized to
TATA box binding protein as reference gene.
McrBC methylation-sensitive PCR. DNA methylation analysis was performed with genomic DNA digested overnight with 10 units McrBC/μg
DNA (New England Biolabs; ref. 17). Cleaved DNA was amplified by PCR
using 2× green master mix (Promega) with the following IFN-κ primers:
region A sense 5′-TTCTAGGATTCAACCTCAAAGC-3′ and antisense 5′TTCGTCTGGCATAACTGCTG-3′, region B sense 5′-CCATGCCAGGGAAATAAGAA-3′ and antisense 5′-ATGGCTGCACATTTGGCTAT-3′, region C
sense 5′-TGCATGGCTGAAAATACAGG-3′ and antisense 5′-TTTTCTGTGGTGAGCAAGTA-3′, region D sense 5′-CAACTGATTGGAACTGAGCC3′ and antisense 5′-TGGAAGAATAATGGGTGGTTTT-3′, region E sense
5′-GCCATGTTTGTGGAACTGTG-3′ and antisense 5′-TTGACCAAATAACCTTCCTCTGA-3′, and region F sense 5′-TCCTTTTCCCTCGAAATCT-3′ and antisense 5′-TTGCGTAGCCACAATCTCTG-3′. PCR
conditions were as follows: 3 min denaturation at 94°C followed for
30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 1 min at 58°C, 1 min at 72°C, and 10 min at 72°C.
IFN-κ cloning and transfection of SiHa cells. Human IFN-κ gene
(Genbank NM_020124) was amplified by PCR with final blunt-end sites using Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and subcloned into
the pCMV3tag vector (Stratagene). Human IFN-κ pCMV3tag was transfected using the Fugene-HD reagent (Roche). Selection was done in the
presence of 0.5 mg/mL G418 (Invitrogen). G418-resistant colonies were
pooled and analyzed.
Antiviral titration assays and Sendai virus infections. Cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) using multiplicities of infections as described (9). For Sendai virus infection, serum-free medium
and Sendai virus (Cantell strain) were added using 32 hemagglutinating
units per 4.0 × 105 cells. After 1 h of viral adsorption, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum.
Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the IFN-κ promoter. Computer analysis was done using the Methyl Primer Express program (Applied Biosystems). Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy kit (Qiagen) and
subjected to bisulfite treatment using the EpiTect Bisulfite kit (Epigentek).
DNA was purified and amplified by PCR with the Phusion DNA polymerase
(New England Biolabs): One amplified fragment covered a CpG island
containing 18 CpG sites localized from positions −2371 to −2115. For amplification, the following primers were used: position −2371 sense 5′-TATTAAATAAGAAATATTTGGTTAGGTATA-3′ and position −2115 antisense

5′-TCACAAATAACTAAAATTACAAACAC-3′. The second amplified fragment covered a stretch of 5 CpG sites located adjacent to the 5′-side of
the transcription start site (−276 to −128). For PCR, the following primers
were used: position −276 sense 5′-TGTTGGGGATGGATTATTTAGGTATT3′ and position −128 antisense 5′-TTCAACAAAAAAAATTTTCTCATTC-3′.
The amplified fragments were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification
kit (Qiagen), cloned into the pJet system (Fermentas), and sequenced.
IFN-κ and p53 small interfering RNA. IFN-κ was targeted with ONTARGETplus SMART pool L-013217, p53 was targeted with ON-TARGETplus SMART pool L-00332900, and the negative control was targeted with
the Nontargeting pool D-001810-10-05 (all obtained from Dharmacon).
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes (40 nmol/L) were transfected
into HPV16 E7 HPKs using HiPerFect (Qiagen). Cells were harvested after
72 h (for RNA extraction) and 96 h (for protein extraction) and analyzed
as described above.
Immunohistochemical analysis of IFN-κ expression on tissue
sections. Tissue sections (4–5 μm) were cut from formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded biopsies of normal cervical mucosa and cervical carcinoma. Sections were deparaffinized and incubated in 3% H2O2 in PBS for 10 min to
block endogenous peroxidase. For antigen retrieval, the sections were heated in a pressure cooker in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 1 min.
Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubating with 2.5% normal
horse serum. The sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with IFN-κ antibody. For detection, the ImmPRESS peroxidase detection kit was used
(Vector Labs). Sections were washed in bi-distilled water, briefly soaked
in Meyer's hematoxylin, washed again for 10 min, and dehydrated in ascending ethanol. Xylene was applied twice and the slides were mounted
with Eukitt. Consecutive sections to those stained for IFN-κ were stained
for the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and p16INK4a using routinely employed staining protocols as described previously (18).

Results
IFN expression in primary and immortalized human keratinocytes. RT-PCR analyses showed that E7-immortalized cells
maintain similar IFN-κ steady-state levels as primary human keratinocytes, whereas IFN-κ was significantly diminished in cells harboring the E6 oncoprotein or in HPV16-positive cervical carcinoma
cell lines CaSki and SiHa (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the reduction of
IFN-κ on the transcriptional level, there was also an absence of the
corresponding protein (Fig. 1B).
Together with IFN-α/β, IFN-κ belongs to type I IFNs, which
transmit their signal through the same receptor complex (19). Similar to IFN-κ (Fig. 1A), we showed previously that cervical carcinoma cells also lacked or have reduced IFN-β expression (9, 10).
Although it has been reported that HPV16 E7 inhibits TLR9 transcription (20), IFN-β can be alternatively induced through the RIG1/Mda5–dependent pathway (21) when cells were infected with
RNA viruses (22). Because both pattern recognition receptor genes
were expressed in our cell systems (Supplementary Fig. S1), we
infected cells with Sendai virus known to activate the IRF-3 (22).
Figure 1C shows that infection strongly induced IFN-β expression
in all cells tested. In contrast, IFN-κ transcription could not be
activated, suggesting either the lack of specific transcription factors or due to silencing through a cis-regulatory mechanism.
Restoration of IFN-κ expression upon demethylation. Considering the latter case, cells were incubated either with inhibitors
blocking the activity of histone deacetylases (sodium butyrate or
trichostatin A) or with the demethylating agent (5-dAza-C). As depicted in Fig. 2A, none of the histone deacetylase inhibitors were
able to increase IFN-κ in E6 or E6/E7 cells, indicating that this kind
of treatment was not sufficient to reconstitute a functional IFN-κ
pathway. Moreover, consistent with previous results (23), type I
IFN signaling requires histone deacetylation because the IFN-κ

steady-state level was even reduced in E7-immortalized keratinocytes in the presence sodium butyrate and trichostatin A. In contrast, treatment with 5-dAza-C resulted in a reactivation of the
IFN-κ gene in E6- and E6/E7–positive cells (Fig. 2B, top), suggesting
that the IFN-κ promoter is hypermethylated.
To analyze whether reactivation could also be achieved in cervical carcinoma cell lines, CaSki and SiHa cells were incubated
with different concentrations of 5-dAza-C alone or in combination
with histone deacetylase inhibitors. Figure 2B (bottom) shows that
5-dAza-C provoked reexpression of IFN-κ in CaSki cells but not
when sodium butyrate was added 24 hours before harvesting. Conversely, no reactivation could be observed in SiHa cells. Decreased
stability or inefficient incorporation of the drug cannot account
for this because the DNA of both cell lines were demethylated (see
Fig. 3D). Sequencing the upstream region of IFN-κ failed to show any
structural rearrangements or mutations between positions −1964 to
−1 relative to the transcriptional start site and corresponds to the
Genbank sequence (see NM_020124). Whether there is another
mechanism of IFN-κ silencing in SiHa cells remains to be elucidated.
IFN-κ could be also induced by 5-dAza-C in HPV18-positive HeLa
cervical carcinoma cells, but not in C33a cells, where p53 is found
to be mutated (ref. 24; Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Nonetheless, there was even a counterselection against 5-dAzaC–mediated IFN-κ reactivation because withdrawal of the drug
again resulted in >10-fold reduction of IFN-κ expression as determined by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 2C, bottom). This indicates that
IFN-κ and HPV16 E6 expression seems to be mutually exclusive.

Mapping CpG-rich islands within the IFN-κ regulatory
region. Computational analysis of the IFN-κ upstream region
(positions −5135 to +1634) revealed two CpG-rich islands located
between positions −2371 to −2115 and positions −276 to −128 relative to the transcriptional start site (Fig. 3A). To verify their presence in vivo, a strategy was applied to scan distinct regions for the
presence of methylated DNA (25). Taking advantage of McrBC, a
restriction endonuclease that only cleaves DNA when methylated
CpG residues are present (17), the appearance of PCR products
can be used as indicator for the absence of methylation. The whole
upstream region, including parts of the IFN-κ gene, was dissected
into six fragments (Fig. 3A), where PCR products should selectively
disappear or be diminished when hypermethylation occurred.
Figure 3B shows that fragments A, B, C, and F persisted, excluding
extensive methylation (see also Supplementary Fig. S2D). However,
differences became evident when fragments D and E were compared (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S2D). Here, region D was
cleaved in all cells (lanes 3, 6, and 9, respectively), whereas the fragment covering region E could still be amplified in E7-immortalized
keratinocytes (bottom, lane 3) but was completely absent in SiHa
and CaSki cells (bottom, lanes 6 and 9). This indicates that the CpG
region was not methylated in E7-immortalized keratinocytes. As
shown above (Fig. 2B), 5-dAza-C incubation can restore IFN-κ
transcription in CaSki but not in SiHa cells. Hence, to perform
the reverse experiment, one can predict that demethylated DNA
should be protected again from McrBC cleavage when DNA of
5-dAza-C–treated cells is examined. This was indeed the case.
Figure 3C shows that PCR fragments reappeared and were no
longer cleaved by McrBC (bottom, compare lanes 5 and 6 as well
as lanes 8 and 9).
Fine analysis after the bisulfite sequencing (26) indicated that
the methylation pattern within region D (positions −2371 to −2115)
was almost identical (Fig. 3D, left). In contrast, all cells lacking
IFN-κ expression revealed strong hypermethylation within region
E, whereas the corresponding DNA was almost methylation-free in
primary and E7-positive keratinocytes. Moreover, bisulfite sequencing after 5-dAza-C treatment (Fig. 3D, right) also showed that
despite differences in IFN-κ reactivation in SiHa and CaSki cells,
DNA became demethylated in both cell lines.
Reconstitution of IFN-κ restores antiviral activity. Because
our previous studies have shown that cervical carcinoma cells
are extremely sensitive to infection with VSV due to their lack
of type I IFN expression (9, 10), we next tested whether reconstitution of IFN-κ can protect malignant HPV16-positive cells
against viral infection. For this purpose, the cDNA of IFN-κ was
stably introduced in SiHa cells along with a dominant selection
marker. To avoid position effects of integrated DNA in individual
clones, G418-resistant cells were pooled and analyzed. Although
restored IFN-κ expression was not affecting the steady-state level
of viral E6/E7 transcription (Fig. 4A), the p53 protein level was
enhanced. Moreover, IFN-κ–positive SiHa cells also showed a
significant increase of IRF-1, IRF-7, and IRF-9, all key regulatory
proteins involved in immediate and delayed IFN response (27).
Concomitantly to p53 and IRFs, MxA as a central component of
an IFN-induced antiviral state (28) was also found to be upregulated (Fig. 4B).
To examine whether the IFN-κ–specific mRNA was translated
into functional protein to build up an antiviral response, protection assays against VSV-mediated cytolysis were carried
out (Fig. 4C). VSV is a member of the Rhabdoviridae RNA virus
family, being exceptionally sensitive to type I IFN (29). As already

IFN-κ Regulation in HPV16-Positive Cells

seen after staining (Fig. 4C, top), quantification reveals that IFN-κ–
positive SiHa cells were strongly protected against VSV infection
(bottom), clearly showing that reconstituted IFN-κ leads to an antiviral state.
Because enhanced p53 levels can improve the type I IFN response (30) and vice versa (31), we next asked whether knocking
down constitutive IFN-κ expression in E7-positive keratinocytes
had a reverse effect. As shown in Fig. 4D (top), siRNA directed
against IFN-κ significantly reduced p53, IRF-1, IRF-7, IRF-9, and
MxA, strongly supporting the notion that constitutive IFN-κ expression maintains threshold levels of p53, which, in turn, guarantees to conserve an alert antiviral state. A positive regulatory
circuit between IFN-κ and p53, as well as type I IFN downstream
targets, could also be shown when p53 was knocked down after
siRNA delivery (Fig. 4D, bottom).
IFN-κ is not expressed in cervical cancer biopsies. To estimate the clinical relevance of our in vitro data, RNAs from tumor
samples and normal biopsies were monitored by RT-PCR for the
presence of HPV16 E6 and IFN-κ. Figure 5A illustrates that, in con-

trast to HPV16-negative control tissues, cervical cancer samples
showed impaired IFN-κ expression, inversely correlating with viral
transcription. Immunohistochemical examination of tissue specimen from patients positive for HPV16 lacked IFN-κ staining in
all cervical tumor sections examined thus far (10 of 10). Figure 5B
to D depicts a representative example of a HPV16-positive cervical
tumor section, where the overview showed histologically normal
squamous epithelium as well as features of a grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1). As shown in histologically normal mucosal areas, most of the cells in parabasal and suprabasal layers were
positive for IFN-κ, whereas there was weaker staining in CIN1, which
was absent in the corresponding tumor region. Control staining for
the pRb (Fig. 5C) illustrates decreased pRb with increasing progression of the lesions. Conversely, there was a strong increase of
p16INK4a (Fig. 5D), known to be negatively regulated by pRb (32).
In conclusion, these data indicate that the loss of IFN-κ expression
is an early event in HPV-induced carcinogenesis, the absence of
which could be considered as an additional marker for progressing
lesions.

Discussion
Our data show that primary human keratinoyctes, as well as immortalized cells only encoding the HPV16 E7 oncoprotein, maintain constitutive IFN-κ expression, whereas the gene is strongly
suppressed in E6- and E6/E7–positive cells as well as in HPV16/
18 cervical carcinoma cell lines (Fig. 1A; see Supplementary

Fig. S2). Notably, IFN-κ expression already becomes downregulated
during initial immortalization in vitro even in the absence of
any immunomodulatory environment. IFN-κ reduction occurred
2 weeks after HPV16 E6 delivery through amphotropic retroviruses
(Supplementary Fig. S2B), supporting the idea that IFN-κ dysregulation can be considered as an early event in virus-induced

carcinogenesis. This is further substantiated by the finding that
IFN-κ is also diminished in precursor lesions and finally absent
in cervical cancer samples (Fig. 5).
The development of cancer can be regarded as an evolutionary
process (33), in which genes that are not compatible with cell
proliferation are turned off either by irreversible genetic loss or
by reversible downregulation through epigenetic means (34).
Moreover, there even exists a cross-talk between cis- and transregulatory mechanisms because decreased transcriptional activity
due to the presence/absence of a putative trans-repressor/activator can trigger epigenetic alterations (35, 36). Such a situation
marks promoter sequences for histone modifications and de novo
methylation, finally leading to suppression of the respective gene
(37–39).
HPV16/18 apparently act through both of these mechanisms.
As shown previously, cervical carcinoma cells lack the ability to
express IFN-β on TNF-α treatment, which was mainly attributed
to the absence of the IRF-1, an important trans-acting activator of

www.aacrjournals.org

the IFN-β promoter (9, 10). However, IFN-β as intermediate-early
IFN (40) can be reactivated after infection with RNA viruses
(21, 22), where IRF-3 is replacing IRF-1 in building up the IFN-β
enhanceosome (41). This efficiently operates for IFN-β but not
for IFN-κ (Fig. 1C), which we considered as experimental hint that
the gene might be locked by a cis-regulatory mechanism (Figs. 2 and 3).
In fact, as revealed by PCR-based “bisulfite sequencing” (42), there
is a 148-bp DNA sequence (positions −276 to −128) close to the
transcriptional start site that is hypermethylated in E6- and E6/
E7–immortalized HFKs as well as in cervical carcinoma cells but
not in E7-expressing cells or primary HFKs (Fig. 3D). IFN-κ transcription, however, could be reconstituted when the cells were
treated with 5-dAza-C (Fig. 2B). Apparently, there is even a counterselection against functional reactivation of IFN-κ because
withdrawal of 5-dAza-C again reduced expression (Fig. 2C). Hence,
continuous expression of HPV16 E6 seems to be necessary to maintain IFN-κ suppression because siRNA directed against E6 lead to a
reactivation of IFN-κ after 72 hours (Supplementary Fig. S2C).

In contrast, no reactivation could be achieved when cells were
treated with inhibitors of histone deacetylases (Fig. 2A and B).
Although histone deacetylases are known to act as corepressors
instead of coactivators in modulating gene expression, their
function as positive regulators of IFN signaling is well established
(23, 43, 44).
Transcriptional silencing of proinflammatory cytokines by
hypermethylation is not without precedence. Considering IFN-γ
for instance, there is differential cytokine expression in naive
versus memory CD8 T cells, which is controlled by epigenetic
mechanisms. Whereas the hypermethylated IFN-γ gene is only
induced after longer incubation with 5-dAza-C in naive T-cells,
the regulatory region of IFN-γ in memory cells is demethylated
within hours after antigen exposure (45). Referring to our system,
continued demethylation is necessary for transcription, suggesting
that activation of IFN-κ required cell division and chromatin remodeling before the gene could be transcribed (46). Although E7 of
HPV16 can interact with and activate DNA methyltransferase
Dnmt1 (47), this kind of interaction cannot account for gene silencing because IFN-κ transcription is not biased in E7-positive
cells (Fig. 1A).

Of note is the finding that reexpression of IFN-κ in SiHa cells
(Fig. 4A) leads to an induction of an antiviral state by upregulation
of p53, IRFs, and MxA (Fig. 4B), resulting in a protective effect
against VSV infection (Fig. 4C). Here, p53 is increased without
changes in the viral splicing pattern of E6 in favor to E6*, known
to counteract p53 degradation (48). This supports the previous
finding of a functional cross-talk between type I IFN signal transduction and p53 upregulation (49). Consequently, increased levels
of p53, in turn, seem to enhance the IFN response in a way that an
antiviral alert is induced (30). Considering this scenario in terms of
the ectopic reconstitution of IFN-κ in SiHa cells (Fig. 4A) and the
siRNA knockdown experiments of IFN-κ and p53 in E7-expressing
HFKs (Fig. 4D), the following model can be envisioned: high-risk
HPV E6 expression leads to both p53 degradation (48) and de novo
methylation of IFN-κ in the host cells (Fig. 3). This interferes with
an apparent cross-talk between IFN-κ and p53 (and vice versa),
which consecutively affects the expression of IRF-1, IRF-7, IRF-9,
and MxA (Fig. 4), all known to be p53-responsive genes (30). p53
can be also induced by type I IFN through IFN-stimulated response
element–like sequences within the promoter and the first intron
regions (19), which may, in turn, activate constitutive IFN-κ

IFN-κ Regulation in HPV16-Positive Cells

expression by a positive regulatory circuit (Fig. 4B and D).
Although only reported up to now in rodent cells, constitutive
activation of type I IFN can prevent cellular transformation (50),
which may be also true for human keratinocytes (Fig. 1A). An
explanation of how E6 is mediating IFN-κ silencing could be
through downregulation of IRF7 (Fig. 4D), which has a potential
in silico binding site within the proximal CpG island (positions
−118 to −98), targeted by de novo methylation (Fig. 3D). Reduced
transcriptional activity as a consequence of IRF-7 reduction could
mark this region for epigenetic modification, which is otherwise
counterbalanced by constitutive IFN-κ expression through the
above-mentioned positive regulatory loop.
The situation deduced from cell culture studies seem to be valid
also for the in vivo situation. Downregulation of IFN-κ was evident
already in tumor-adjacent cervical mucosa displaying CIN1 morphology (Fig. 5), which is in analogy to immortalized keratinocytes
grown under in vitro conditions (Fig. 1).

In conclusion, these data identify the IFN-κ gene as a novel
target of high-risk HPVs, where the genuine host innate immune
response becomes suppressed by an epigenetic mechanism.
