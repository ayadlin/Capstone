ABSTRACT
Despite advances in treatment, multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable. Here
we propose the use of STK405759, a novel microtubule targeting agent (MTA) and
member of the furan metotica family for MM therapy.
STK405759 inhibited tubulin polymerization in a cell-free system and in
myeloma cells. This molecule had potent cytotoxic activity against several MM cell
lines and patient-derived MM cells. Moreover, STK405759 demonstrated cytotoxicity
against drug-resistant myeloma cells that overexpressed the P-glycoprotein drugefflux pump. STK405759 was not cytotoxic to peripheral blood mononuclear cells,
including activated B and T lymphocytes. This compound caused mitotic arrest
and apoptosis of myeloma cells characterized by cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase-1 and caspase-8, as well as decreased protein expression of mcl-1.
The combination of STK405759 with bortezomib, lenalidomide or dexamethasone
had synergistic cytotoxic activity. In in vivo studies, STK405759-treated mice had
significantly decreased MM tumor burden and prolonged survival compared to
vehicle treated- mice.
These results provide a rationale for further evaluation of STK405759 as
monotherapy or part of combination therapy for treating patients with MM.

alternative next generation therapeutic agents remains
critically important.
MTAs function by affecting microtubules assembly/
disassembly and have been shown to induce apoptosis in
a wide variety of cancer cells, demonstrating a potent
antitumor activity. The anti-mitotic drugs in current
clinical use, including taxanes, epothilones and vinca
alkaloids are all MTAs. However, the use of these
compounds is limited primarily due to intrinsic or acquired
resistance, usually correlated with overexpression of
P-glycoprotein (Pgp) [6–8].
Recently, a novel set of MTAs named furan metotica
has been described [9–10]. This group comprises a new

INTRODUCTION
MM is characterized by clonal expansion of
malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow leading
to multiple bone lesions, anemia, renal injury and
immunodeficiency [1]. MM represents 1% of all cancer
diagnoses and comprises 2% of all cancer deaths.
Autologous stem cell transplantation together with novel
anti-MM agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide (LEN),
bortezomib (BTZ) and their analogues, has improved
clinical outcomes. However, the development of drug
resistance is universal and MM continues to be mostly
an incurable disease [2–5]. Thus, the pursuit of newer

chemotype that bind to tubulin in a unique manner. They
prevent the outer kinetochore Ndc80 complex and the
microtubule plus-end tracking protein CLIP-170 from
binding to the taxol-stabilized microtubules. Until now,
five members of this family have been shown to act as
microtubule depolymerizing agents. Their advantages
compared to other MTAs include their simple chemical
structure, potent antitumor activity and ability to overcome
drug-resistance.
This study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo antiMM activity of STK405759, a novel member of the furan
metotica family, and tested its potential as a MTA in
preclinical models of human MM.

STK405759 reduces viability of MM cells
STK405759 significantly decreased survival of
several human MM cell lines in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner. Its cytotoxicity included MM cell
lines resistant to anti-MM agents currently in use, such as
RPMI-MR20 (mitoxantrone-resistant cells), RPMI-LR5
(melphalan (MEL)-resistant cells) and RPMI-DOX40
(doxorubicin (DOXO)-resistant cells) (Figure 1A-1B).
The IC50 value after 48 h of treatment was less than 50
nM for each cell line tested. STK405759 also had selective

evaluation. G. B and T lymphocytes from healthy donors (n=3) were isolated and cultured in the presence of mitogens and STK405759 for
7 days. Cell viability was analyzed by flow cytometry. Each treatment was performed in triplicate in three independent experiments (cell

cytotoxic activity on affinity-purified CD138+ MM cells
from bone marrow samples of 2 MM patients. In contrast,
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the
same patients and from healthy donors were not affected
by the cytotoxic effect of STK405759. In particular, there
was no decrease in viability of cultured B lymphocytes,
T lymphocytes and NK cells after 48h of STK405759
exposure (Figure 1E-1F). Similarly, the viability of T and
B cells stimulated with mitogens did not decrease after
7 days of exposure to STK405759 at 20, 40 and 60 nM
(Figure 1G).
STK405759 caused cell death of RPMI-S cells cocultured with HS-5 BMSCs (Figure 2A-2B). In contrast
to Dexamethasone (DEX) [11–13], neither IL-6 nor IGF1

prevented STK405759 induced apoptosis of MM cells
(Figure 2C-2F).

STK405759 inhibits tubulin polymerization
in vitro and decreases the insoluble fraction of
microtubules mass in MM cells
Given the similar chemical structure to that of
STK405759 and the furan metotica MTAs family [9,
10], (Figure 3A), STK405759 was evaluated as a MTA.
It inhibited the rate and extent of tubulin polymerization
in a concentration-dependent manner in an in vitro cellfree system (Figure 3B) and in MM cells. We used Western
blot to analyze the amounts of soluble and polymerized

forms of tubulin in MM cells. STK405759 treatment
of RPMI-S cells decreased their levels of polymerized
tubulin respective to the free soluble tubulin fraction in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C) in as soon as 30 min
and reached a maximum after 24 h of treatment (Figure
3D). This effect was reversible, since when RPMI-S cells
were treated with STK405759, then washed and grown
in medium without STK405759 for 24 h, the level of
polymerized tubulin returned to that of untreated cells at

the different time intervals tested (Figure 3D). As a control,
treatment of MM cells with paclitaxel, an inhibitor of
tubulin depolymerization, was associated with an increase
in polymerized tubulin whereas treatment with nocodazole,
a tubulin depolymerizing agent, was associated with a
decrease in polymerized tubulin (Figure 3E).
Most of the tubulin protein was found in
insoluble fractions in the different MM cell lines tested,
including those resistant to mitoxantrone, MEL and

STK405759 also reduced the level of polymerized

treatment but had no effect on OcyM5 and MM cell lines
resistant RPMI-LR5, RPMI-MR20 and RPMI-DOX40.

cells displayed abnormal chromosome and spindle

STK405759 disrupts the morphology of mitotic
spindles

To determine whether STK405759 interrupted
mitosis, the DNA content of MM cells was analyzed by
flow cytometry after STK405759 treatment at various
intervals within a 24 h period. STK405759 increased the
percentage of RPMI-S cells in G2/M phase (Figures 5A5B) as early as 3 h, and reached a maximal peak between
6 and 12 h of treatment. After 24 h of exposure, most of
RPMI-S cells were at sub G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle,
indicative of cell death.
To distinguish between distribution of G2 and M
phases, cells were incubated with the MPM-2 antibody

RPMI-S cells treated with 70 nM STK405759 for
12 h were fixed, stained for microtubules with anti-tubulin
antibody and for chromatin with DAPI, and examined
by confocal microscopy. There was no observable
difference in the morphology of the microtubules during
interphase between control and STK405759 treated
cells. During mitosis, control RPMI-S cells presented
a normal bipolar mitotic spindle with all chromosomes
assembled in a compact central region between the two

nuclear location and integrity was conducted during the sealing of the slides with antifade. Slides were examined using an inverted confocal
microscope (Zeiss LSM780 Inverted Confocal Microscope – with multi-photon capabilities).

that detects proteins phosphorylated at the onset of
mitosis [14]. Compared to control RPMI-S cells,
STK405759 treated cells showed increased MPM-2
protein levels that reached a maximum at 15 h and then
declined through 24 h of treatment (Figure 5C).
As mitotically arrested cells frequently undergo
apoptosis, it was considered of interest to examine
whether this was the cytotoxic mechanism of
STK405759. STK405759 increased apoptosis of MM
cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner
(Figure 5D). The induction of apoptosis was supported

by the cleavage of caspase-8 and poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) in MM treated cells (Figure 5E)
and by the decreased in myeloid cell leukemia-1 (mcl-1)
protein level. Treatment with the apoptotic inhibitor Z-VADFMK prevented STK405759 induced cell death and the
changes induced by STK405759 in the expression of the
apoptotic related proteins mcl-1 and PARP (Figure 5F-5G).
STK405759 reduced the expression of pAKT/AKT
and pCREB/CREB in a time-dependent manner in MM
treated cells without changing the level of MEK protein
(Figure 5G).

Sensitivity of MM cells to MTAs

All MTAs tested killed 50% of MM cells at
nanomolar range concentration emphasizing the high
responsiveness of MM cells (Figure 6B). RPMI-DOX40
cells which overexpress Pgp, [15, 16] remained fully
sensitive to STK4057579 (Figure 1B), as did nocodazole
and podophyllotoxin (Figure 6B) but were resistant to
vincristine, taxol and colchicine treatment. Therefore,
compare to other MTAs, STK405759 cause similar
morphologic changes and potent cytotoxic activity on MM
cells but overcame some forms of resistance.

The morphology of cells treated with
STK405759 and other MTAs was evaluated by optical
microscopy (Figure 6A). Each of the MTAs tested,
including vincristine, taxol, colchicine, nocodazole,
podophyllotoxin and STK405759 elongated the
cytoplasm on MM cell lines (RPMI-S, OPM2 and CAG
cells), that was visible after 12-18 h of treatment and then
disappeared (Figure 6A).

and presented as mean ± SE. Photomicrographs were examined using an Olympus IX-70 microscope and images were processed using

STK405759 enhances cytotoxicity of
conventional and novel anti-MM therapies

STK405759 showed synergistic, cytotoxic activity in
MM cells when combined with BTZ, LEN or DEX. In
an in vivo xenograft mice model of MM, STK405759
induced a significant reduction in tumor burden and
prolonged overall survival. Taken together, these results
show that STK405759 has potent and selective cytotoxic
activity in preclinical models of MM.
STK405759 prevented tubulin polymerization in
a cell-free system and in viable MM cells. MTAs have
been suggested as potential MM drugs [19–26]. However,
the use of plaquitaxel and docetaxel was shown to be
ineffective in relapsing refractory MM [19, 21] and the
effectiveness of thalidomide and vincristine was limited
by toxicity and development of drug resistance [22, 28]. In
MM, Pgp overexpression was associated with vincristine,
DOXO, etoposide, glucocorticoid and carfilzomib
resistance [16, 29–32]. We showed that RPMI-DOX40,
the Pgp-positive multidrug resistant subline, remained
fully sensitive to STK405759 cytotoxicity. In agreement
with our results, other members of the furan metotica
family have also been shown to evade Pgp activity in
drug-resistant cancer cells [10]. Compare to flubendazole
and nocodazole, MTAs that also overcame Pgp- drug
resistance, STK405759 had the lowest IC50 value and
required a lower dose to decrease tumor burden in mice
[33, 34].
The disruption of microtubules dynamics caused by
STK405759 treatment led to mitotic cell arrest as soon
as 3 h after treatment and inactivation of AKT signaling
(following 14 hours of treatment; data not shown). Cell
death was triggered by activation of pro-apoptotic proteins
(caspase-8 and PARP) and by decreased levels of the mcl1 anti-apoptotic protein (following 24 hours of treatment).
Constitutive activation of the AKT kinase is
considered a key oncogenic signal in MM and is
associated with poor patient prognosis and drug resistance

The response of RPMI-S and MM.1S cells
to STK405759 treatment in combination with BTZ,
LEN, DEX, MEL and DOXO was evaluated by
XTT assay (Table 1). The data obtained indicated
that STK405759 triggered a synergistic effect when
combined with LEN, DEX and BTZ (CI<1). The cotreatment of STK405759 with MEL or DOXO had an
antagonist cytotoxic effect (CI >1) according to the
Chou-Talalay method [17, 18].

STK405759: in vivo anti-myeloma efficacy
STK405759 inhibited tumor growth (P<0.0005,
t-test, Figure 7A) and increased the overall survival
of treated mice (P = 0.0001, log rank, Figure 7B) as
compared to control mice. No significant changes in
weight or other signs of potential toxicity were observed
during STK405759 treatment (Figure 7C). Sections
from tumors of treated mice showed increased apoptosis
compared to controls confirming the previously discussed
in vitro results (Figure 7D).

DISCUSSION
The current study showed that STK405759 is a
novel MTA that induced MM cytotoxicity in vitro and
in vivo. STK405759 was active at low concentrations
against a broad range of MM cell lines and patientderived MM cells, regardless of their sensitivity to
conventional and novel therapies. This compound
was not toxic towards PBMCs, including activated
B and T cells. STK405759 treatment overcame MM
cells resistance mediated by the presence of BMSCs.

[35, 36]. STK405759 induced significant inhibition of
AKT activity and expression in MM cells. Localization of
AKT to microtubules sustains its activity, while disruption
of microtubules attenuates AKT signaling independently
of its initial activation [37]. Thus, the decreased AKT
signaling observed following STK405759 treatment might
be a consequence of tubulin destabilization.
Mcl-1 is over-expressed in cells from MM
patients, acts as a survival protein, and correlates with
relapse and short survival [38–40]. Accumulation of
mcl-1 triggered by proteasome inhibition confers MM

cell resistance to BTZ-induced lethality [41]. Thus,
STK405759 treatment, may play a role as a single agent
against myeloma cells that depend on decreased mcl1 for survival, and in combination with other drugs
where mcl-1 overexpression is the main mechanism of
resistance.
In summary, the advantages of STK405759 as a
MTA include the simplicity of its chemical structure
which may help prevent acute toxicity, its potent ability to
overcome drug resistance and its ability to decrease AKT
and mcl-1 expression.

cells per 96 well and exposed to different concentrations
of STK405759 for 48h. The cells were resuspended in Cell
Staining Buffer, incubated with CD3, CD20 and CD56
antibodies (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA) and stained with PI to distinguish live from nonviable cells. Data were collected using FACS Calibur
and analyzed with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Compounds
STK405759 was synthesized and provided
by Vitas-M Laboratory (Apeldoorn, Netherlands).
MEL, DEX, DOXO, vincristine, colchicine, taxol,
nocodazole and podophyllotoxin were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). LEN and BTZ
were provided by Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA).
Z-VAD–FMK was purchased from Apexbio Technology,
Houston, TX, USA.

B and T lymphocytes stimulation
PBMC were isolated from heparinized venous
blood by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. B cells were
isolated with anti-CD19 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). B and T cells were
cultured (2.0 x 10 6 cell/ml) with RPMI-1640 medium
containing 10% fetal calf serum, L-glutamine, penicillin/
streptomycin (Gibco/BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), 1%
HEPES buffer and β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA). Purified B lymphocytes cultures
were stimulated with pokeweed mitogen (PWM, 10
μg/mL), PMA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate;
10 ng/mL) and calcium ionophore (1 μg/mL). T cells
were stimulated with IL-2 (10 ng/ml, PeproTech, Rocky
Hill, NJ, USA), PMA (10 ng/mL) and ionomycin (1 μg/
mL; all Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The cells
were treated with STK405759 20, 40 and 60 nM during
7 days. The medium and reagents were replenished
every 48 h. Viability of the cells was quantitated by
flow cytometry staining with fluorochrome-conjugated
monoclonal antibodies (aCD20 for B cells and aCD3 for
T cells) and PI.

Cell lines
Human MM cell lines RPMI 8226 (RPMI-S),
MM.1S, U266 and the human BM stromal cell (BMSCs)
line HS-5 were purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA,
USA. The RPMI sublines RPMI-MR20, RPMI-LR5 and
RPMI-DOX40 and the CAG, OPM1 and OPM2 cell
lines were kindly provided by Jana Jakubikova (DanaFarber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA). MM cell
lines were grown in RPMI-1640 medium and HS-5
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco/BRL,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA), both supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum and antibiotics (Biological Industries,
Beit Haemek, Israel).

Cell viability assay

Co-culture experiments

MM cell lines were plated at 1-2 x104 cells per
96-well and treated with different concentrations of
STK405759. For patient samples, bone marrow aspirates
were collected after obtaining signed informed consent
in accordance with regulations of Chaim Sheba Medical
Center, Tel Aviv, Israel. Bone marrow and peripheral
blood were processed by lymphoprep (Axis-Shield
PoC, Oslo, Norway) to isolate mononuclear cells and
myeloma cells were purified using CD138 microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Cell
viability was measured using XTT cell proliferation Kit
(Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Recombinant human
interleukin 6 (IL-6) and insulin-like growth factor 1
(IGF1) (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) were used in
cultures of RPMI-S cells, as indicated.

RPMI-S cells, previously stained with CFSE
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA),
were added to wells seeded with HS-5 BMSCs and
exposed to STK405759 treatment for 48 h. Then, the
cells were collected and stained with PI. Data were
collected using FACS Calibur and analyzed with
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA).

Cell-free tubulin polymerization assay
This
assay
was
performed
following
manufacturer’s instructions (Cytoskeleton, Denver,
CO). The reaction was conducted in the presence
of 15% glycerol and 3 mg/ml tubulin. Drugs were
dissolved in DMSO and added to the reaction mixtures;
the final concentration of DMSO was <2%. Tubulin
polymerization was monitored by measuring OD340
at 37 °C in a Synergy 4 microplate reader (BioTek
Instruments, Winooski, USA).

antibiotics. STK405759 (70 nM) was added for various
time intervals. Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer
containing 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 5 mM sodium fluoride, 5 g/ml aprotinin, 5
g/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Proteins were
separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
and immunoblotted with anti- caspase-3, caspase-8,
caspase-9, PARP (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA, USA), mcl-1 phospho AKT (Ser473), AKT, MEK,
gapdh and actin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA, USA) and phospho Ser/Thr-Pro mitotic protein
(MPM-2) antibody (Millipore). Immunoreactive bands
were detected by Western Blot chemiluminescence
reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Waltham, MA
USA) and exposed on X-Ray film (Fujifilm Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan).

RPMI-S cells were exposed to STK405759 for
varying intervals. Cells were lysed in microtubules
stabilizing buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 0.14M
NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.4
μg/ml paclitaxel, protease inhibitor mixture (Complete;
Roche Diagnostics), protease inhibitor cocktail 1 and
3 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 12,000
rpm for 10 min. The supernatants containing soluble
tubulin and the pellets containing polymerized tubulin were
collected and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antitubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and antiactin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) antibodies.

Immunofluorescence staining
RPMI-S cells were exposed to 70 nM STK405759 for
12 h and fixed in PBS containing 4% formaldehyde for 15
minutes, washed in PBS and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton
X-100/PBS (10 minutes at 37°C and 10 minutes at 4°C).
After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, the
samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated
antibody against β-tubulin overnight at 4°C. While sealing
the slides with antifade, they were counterstained with
DAPI for nuclear location and integrity. Slides were
examined using an inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss
LSM780 Inverted Confocal Microscope).

Xenograft murine model
Male CB-17/IcrHsd-Prkdc-scid mice (6-8 weeks
old) were maintained in accordance with Institutional
Animal Care Use Committee guidelines. Mice were
housed in the Animal Research Facility of Chaim
Sheba Medical Center and experiments were performed
in accordance with approved protocols. During the
experiment, the mice were gamma-irradiated (150
rads) using Cs137 γ-irradiator source and 24 h postirradiation, injected subcutaneously with 7 x106
RPMI-S cells suspended in PBS. Two weeks later, when
tumors reached 40-70 mm3, mice were randomized
into two groups (10 mice/group), and the following
treatment protocol was implemented. Group 1: control
(DMSO) administered intraperitoneally (ip) 5 days a
week throughout the duration of experiment. Group
2: STK405759 (0.5 mg/kg (administered ip 5 days a
week throughout the duration of experiment. Changes
in body weight and tumor burden were evaluated every
2 to 3 days. Tumor volumes were measured by a caliper
every other day and calculated using the following
formula: length x width2 x 0.5. Mice were sacrificed in
accordance with institutional guidelines when tumors
reached 1.5 cm3 or if the mice appeared moribund, to
prevent unnecessary morbidity to the mice. Tumors were
immediately collected from the mice and analyzed by
histochemistry.

Cell cycle analysis
RPMI-S cells were exposed to 70 nM STK405759 for
varying intervals, permeabilized by 70% ethanol at -20°C
overnight and incubated with 50 μg/ml PI (Becton Dickinson
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and 20 units/ml RNase-A
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). DNA content
was analyzed by flow cytometry. Data were collected
using FACS Calibur and analyzed with CellQuest software
(Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).

Flow cytometry analysis of apoptosis
RPMI-S cells were treated with 40 and 70 nM
STK405759 for 0, 24 and 48 h. For evaluation of
apoptosis, cells were processed using an Annexin V/
PI kit (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Data
were collected using FACS Calibur and analyzed with
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San
Jose, CA, USA).

Histochemistry
The tumors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 24 h (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA),
washed with PBS, dehydrated in increasing alcohol
concentrations and embedded in paraffin blocks.
Sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, treated
with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) for 15 min and washed
in PBS. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3%

Immunoblotting analysis

associated with apoptosis in histological sections was
labeled in situ with digoxigenin-deoxyuridine (dUTP),
introduced by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
(TdT), using ApopTag® peroxidase in situ apoptosis
detection kit according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Intergen, Oxford, England, UK). The reaction was
terminated using the ApopTag® stop buffer followed
by anti-digoxigenin-peroxidase application and the
labeled nuclei were detected with ACE substrate as
the chromogen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
The slides were examined using an Olympus BX-43
microscope, and images were processed using cellSens
entry digital imaging software.
