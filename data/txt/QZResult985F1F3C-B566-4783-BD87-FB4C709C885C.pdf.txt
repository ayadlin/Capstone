Abstract
Overexpression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) increases multidrug
resistance (MDR) in many cancer cells. However, its mechanism is unknown. The aim of
the present study is to detect the association of methylation at the GCS gene promoter
with its expression and MDR in invasive ductal breast cancer. 40 cases GCS-positive
and 40 cases GCS-negative primary breast carcinoma samples, three drug-sensitive
breast cancer cell lines and one multidrug-resistant breast cancer cell line were used.
Immunohistochemistry, methylation-specific PCR (MSP), quantitative real-time (qPCR),
westernblot and cytotoxicity assay techniques were employed. Thwe results revealed
that there was a statistically negative correlation between GCS CpG islands methylation
and GCS phenotype in patients with breast cancer. GCS CpG islands methylation was
negatively associated with high ER, meanwhile positively with high HER-2 status.
Similar results were obtained from the analysis of breast cancer cell lines. Treatment
with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dc) changed the GCS
promoter methylation pattern in three sensitive cells and also caused increased drug
resistance of them. These results suggested that the changes of DNA methylation
status of the GCS promoter correlates with multidrug resistance in breast cancer.

Introduction

GCS enzymatic activity and resulted in resistance to
doxorubicin [9]. A number of methods that suppress the
expression of GCS, such as specific inhibitors, antisense
oligonucleotides and short interfering RNA, render MDR
cells chemosensitive [10, 11]. Hence, understanding of
the mechanism of GCS expression in breast cancer cells
is essential to discover novel chemotherapy targets and
improve the efficacy of chemotherapy treatment.
Genetic abnormalities are insufficient to explain the
mechanism of carcinogenesis. Epigenetics is becoming an
important field of cancer research. DNA methylation is
the predominant epigenetic modification that inhibits gene
expression [12]. Mammalian DNA is heavily methylated at
cytosine residues within CpG dinucleotides, with 60–80%
of such residues being methylated [13]. Various genes
show an inverse relationship between DNA methylation

Breast cancer, the leading cause of death among
women in most countries worldwide, is rapidly increasing
in China [1, 2]. Despite the development of novel
treatment strategies for some malignances, chemotherapy
continues to be the standard therapy for most human
cancers. Multidrug resistance (MDR) remains to be a
serious obstacle in breast cancer treatment [3, 4]. Recently,
accumulating evidence has indicated the important role of
glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) in MDR [5, 6]. GCS
is a transmembrane protein encoded by the UGCG gene
in humans. It can transfer UDP-glucose to ceramide to
form glucosylceramide, and allow cells to escape from
ceramide-induced cellular apoptosis [7, 8]. Liu et al.
introduced GCS cDNA into MCF-7 cells, which increased

and transcription in normal and malignant cells [14].
Growing evidence indicates that DNA methylation status
might be involved in MDR. The MDR1 promoter contains
a CpG island that may be inhibited by methylation
[15, 16, 17]. The breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP)
has a promoter with the similar CpG island that has been
shown to inhibit gene expression via methylation [18].
The human GCS protein is a glycoprotein containing 394
amino acids encoded by 1182 nucleotides. GCS includes
a G + C rich 5′ untranslated region of 290 nucleotides,
containing a CpG island [19]. These findings suggested
that DNA methylation might also be involved in inhibiting
GCS expression. No research has determined the role of
DNA methylation in the transcriptional regulation of GCS
in breast cancer cells. This study aimed to rectify this
omission from the literature.

parameters, including age, histological stage, tumor size,
nodal stage or Ki67 (Table 1).

GCS promoter methylation correlates negatively
with GCS expression in breast cancer cells
To explore the possibility that DNA methylation
inhibits GCS, the methylation status of GCS in four human
breast cancer cell lines was detected by MSP. Complete
methylation was observed in the MDA-MB-231 cell
line, partial methylation in MCF-7 and T47D cell lines,
but unmethylation in the MCF-7/ADM cell line PCR
(Figure 2A).
To evaluate the relationship between different
degrees of methylation of the GCS promoter and its
expression, GCS mRNA expression was detected in breast
cancer cells by quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 2B). The
relative mRNA expression of GCS in the MDA-MB-231
cell line was significantly lower than that in the other
three cell lines (p < 0.05).The relative mRNA expression
of GCS in the MDR breast cancer cells MCF-7/ADM was
significantly higher than that in the other three cell lines
(p < 0.05). The protein expression of GCS was also
detected simultaneously in the breast cancer cells by
westernblot (Figure 2C, 2D); the results coincided with
the mRNA expression.

Results
GCS promoter methylation associates with its
expression and clinicopathological parameters
In primary human invasive ductal carcinoma
tissues, GCS expression was mainly observed in the
cytoplasm of cancer cells. Immunohistochemistry
analysis revealed GCS-negative and GCS-positive
(Figure 1A) expression.MSP was used to measure the
methylation status of GCS. T1 and T2 are representative
of unmethylation status, T3 and T4 are representative
of methylation status (Figure 1B). Among 40 cases
of GCS-positive breast cancer tissues, 25% (10/40)
presented a methylated GCS promoter. Meanwhile
87.5% (35/40) presented a methylated GCS promoter in
40 cases of GCS-negative group (Table 1). A significant
difference appeared comparing the two groups. This
result suggested that methylation of the GCS promoter
was inversely associated with the GCS expression
(r = −0.63, p < 0.01).
Correlation analysis was also performed between
the promoter methylation status and clinicopathological
parameters. Compared with the ER negative group of
61.5% (16/26) methylation levels of GCS CpG islands,
the ER positive group exhibited lower methylation levels
of 35.2% (19/54) (r = −0.249, p = 0.026). Compared
with the HER-2 receptor positive group of 77.8% (21/27)
methylation levels of GCS CpG islands, the HER-2
receptor negative group exhibited lower methylation
levels of 45.3% (24/53) (r = 0.31, p = 0.006). Thus, GCS
methylation status was negatively correlated with ER
positivity, but positively with HER-2 positivity (Table 1).
There was no statistical significance in the relationship
between GCS methylation and other clinicopathological

Reversal of the methylation status in breast
cancer cells by 5-Aza-dc
The high correlation between GCS promoter
methylation and lack of gene expression prompted
us to further explore the role of epigenetics in GCS
gene expression. Previous reports demonstrated that
treatment with the demethylating agent 5-Aza-dC, a
DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitor, could
restore silenced gene expression. Thus, we explored the
responsiveness of the four breast cancer cell lines to 5-AzadC. In MDA-MB-231 cells, methylated GCS gene bands
disappeared and non-methylated GCS bands appeared
(Figure 3A–3A1). In MCF-7 and T47D cells, methylated
bands were still present, but became increasingly weaker
(Figure 3A–3A2, 3A–3A3). However, no change was
found in MCF-7/ADM cells (Figure 3A–3A4).
Treatment with 5-Aza-dC resulted in a significant
enhancement in GCS mRNA (Figure 3B) and protein
expression (Figure 3C, 3D), relative to untreated cells,
in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, T47D cells (p < 0.05).
However, in the corresponding MDR cell line MCF7/ADM, which initially displayed substantial GCS
overexpression, there was no significant change in GCS
gene expression before or after 5-Aza-dc treatment
(p > 0.05).

Discussion

The changes of drug resistance in breast cancer
cells by 5-Aza-dc

The development of a malignant disease occurs via
a multistage process, including genetic and epigenetic
modifications. Epigenetics is a kind of inheritable
gene expression mechanism that does not change
the DNA sequence, and involves DNA methylation,
histone acetylation and chromatin remodeling [20].
DNA methylation is important in various biological
processes, such as genomic imprinting, inactivation of X
chromosomes, cell differentiation and development [21].
Increasing research has focused on the relationship
between DNA methylation and MDR. DNA methylation
is far more vulnerable than the DNA sequence to
external factors. DNA methylation changes can occur
rapidly, resulting in resistance arising quickly following
chemotherapy treatment [22, 23]. Demethylation of CpG
islands in the MDR1 promoter region is a mechanism of
chemoresistance, which induces the expression of P-gp
and the MDR phenotype [24].
Intensive investigations have been performed
regarding correlations between protein expression of
GCS and MDR [9, 10, 11]. However, the mechanism of

Doxorubicin is a common drug for many
carcinomas. The results demonstrated that IC50 for
doxorubicin significantly increased from 0.089 ±
0.002 μmol/L to 2.678 ± 0.267 μmol/L in MDA-MB-231
cells after treated with 5-Aza-dc (p < 0.01).In MCF-7 and
T47D cells, the IC50 also increased (p < 0.05).However,
there was no significant change in the cell line MCF-7/
ADM (Figure 4A, 4B).

Expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a protein in
breast cancer cells
In order to detect the mechanisms of methylation of
GCS promoter, we analyzed the expression of DNMT1and
DNMT3a protein in each cell line. The results displayed
that all the cells expressed the DNMT1 and DNMT3a
protein. The expression of DNMT1 was no significant
difference. However the expression of DNMT3a protein
is highest in MDA-MB-231and that is lowest in MCF-7/
ADM (Figure 5A, 5B).

protein expression by promoter methylation of GCS is
not completely understood. To date, most studies have
focused on the association with GCS and its downstream
effectors. And many results have been obtained. Gouaze
et al. [25] suggested that GCS blockade resensitizes MDR
breast cancer cells to anticancer drugs via downregulation
of MDR1. Liu et al. [26] further demonstrated that
GCS upregulates MDR1 expressions through cSrc and
beta-catein signaling. Zhang et al. showed that GCS
can increase the expression of MDR1 through NF-κ B
signaling in K562/AO2 cells [27]. No relevant research
on upstream effectors that regulate GCS expression has
been reported. The GCS promoter also contains a potential
CpG island; thus, epigenetic changes might regulate
its expression. The purpose of the present study was to
determine whether epigenetic changes influence GCS

expression in breast cancer. To reach this aim, we used
MSP to map the methylation status of CpG sites in the
GCS promoter and then analyzed its association with
GCS expression. The results showed that in breast cancer
tissues, DNA methylation could inhibit GCS expression.
Methylation of the GCS promoter was inversely associated
with GCS expression. The conclusions were similar to a
previous investigation: Lincke et al. demonstrated a rough
correlation between hypomethylation and transcription of
the 5′end of the MDR1 and MDR3 genes [28]. Hirofumi
et al. suggested that methylation status of BCRP was
inversely correlated with its expression in lung cancer cells
[29], multiple myeloma [30] and pancreatic cancer [31].
We also analyzed the correlation between
methylation status of the GCS promoter and
clinicopathological parameters. The results indicated

correlation between methylation status and GCS gene
expression in breast cancer cells.
CpG island hypermethylation and consequent
gene silencing in cancer was found to be induced by
the deregulation of DNMTs [36]. The DNMT inhibitor,
5-Aza-dc, could reactivate silenced genes and has
become a relevant molecular therapy, currently used to
treat hematological malignancies [37, 38]. To further
explore the relationships among DNA methylation, GCS
expression and MDR, 5-Aza-dc was used to treat breast
cancer cells. 5-Aza-dc could reverse GCS promoter
methylation and induced re-expression at the messenger
RNA and protein levels in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7 and
T47D cell lines.
The correlation between GCS CpG islands
methylation and chemotherapy drug sensitivity was
assessed by MTS. The IC50 value of MDA-MB-231,
MCF-7 and T47D increased significantly after treated
with 5-Aza-dc. This suggested that demethylation of
GCS resulted in an apparent increase in the generation
of multidrug-resistant clones. No change was found in
MCF-7/ADM cell lines, which suggested that restoration
of GCS gene expression was caused by transcriptional
upregulation rather than by changed GCS mRNA stability.
In order to explore the mechanisms of GCS methylation,
we detected the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a
of the four cell lines by western blot, we can see that
the DNMT1 protein of the four cell lines didn’t have
significant differences, but the expression of DNMT3a
protein is highest in MDA-MB-231and that is lowest in
MCF-7/ADM. From the result, we can deduce that GCS
methylation is related to the expression of DNMT3a.
These findings suggested that promoter methylation
is responsible for transcriptional silencing of GCS in
patient plasma cells and in cell lines. Demethylation
of the promoter was necessary for GCS re-expression

that methylation of the GCS promoter was negatively
associated with ER positivity, but positively associated
with HER-2 positivity. The results were consistent with
our previous study, in which the expression of GCS
in invasive ductal breast cancer correlated with high
ER and low HER-2 status [32].  Although the study of
Liu demonstrated that GCS overexpression is highly
associated with ER-positive and HER-2-positive breast
cancers that have metastasized, this was a small study [33].
And the correlations between GCS promoter methylation
and ER or HER-2 status need to be further investigated in
future studies. GCS methylation was not correlated with
tumor size, lymph metastasis or histological stage in this
study, suggesting that GCS methylation would not be a
good prognostic indicator for breast cancer.
The presence of a methylated sequence in the
5′regulatory regions of certain genes appears to determine
the level of transcription [34], and DNA methylation
often induces gene inactivation in in vitro transcription
assays [35]. In a recent publication, hypermethylation
of CpG dinucleotides in the MDR1 promoter region also
contributed strongly to differences in gene expression
in related cell lines [15]. To investigate whether certain
distinct DNA methylation patterns were associated with
the GCS phenotype of breast cancer cells, we analyzed
the methylation status and the expression of GCS by
MSP, qPCR and westernblot. We observed that DNA
methylation existed in breast cancer cells, and that
methylation of GCS repressed the gene expression. We
examined the methylation status of the GCS promoter
region in four breast cancer cell lines that differed in
their respective GCS expressions. We found that the
promoter of very low level expressing cells was almost
completely methylated, whereas high and medium GCS
expressions were either completely or almost completely
unmethylated. The results clearly indicated an inverse

and for GCS-induced MDR. CpG island methylation
can cause repression of gene expression either directly
through transcription factors [39] or indirectly through
recruitment methyl-binding proteins [40, 41]. Whether
recruitment of methyl-binding proteins is involved in
the case of the GCS gene remains to be determined. The
mechanism by which DNA methylation controls gene
expression in this model requires further evaluation and
a more detailed understanding of the molecular basis of
the MDR phenotype may provide further opportunities for
subsequent clinical intervention.

and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and T47D were maintained in
L-15(Gibco, USA). All cells were cultured in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Immunohistochemical analyses
Immunohistochemical staining was carried out using
the DAKO Envision detection kit (Dako, Carpinteria,
CA, USA). In brief, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks
were sectioned (4 μm-thick), dried, deparaffinized
and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed in a
microwave oven for 15 min in 10 mM citrate buffer
(pH 6.0). Then cells were embedded in 4% neutral
formaldehyde for 2 h. For all samples, endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked with a 3% H2O2-methanol
solution. The slides were blocked with 10% normal goat
serum for 10 min and incubated with an appropriately
diluted primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The slides were
then probed with an HRP-labeled polymer conjugated
to an appropriate secondary antibody for 30 min. The
antibodies against estrogen receptor (ER, Product No
E07165), progesterone receptor (PR, Product No E06575),
HER-2 (No E07758) and Ki67 (Product No E07806) were
purchased from Roche, Switherland and are all work fluid
and the GCS antibody was purchased from Bioss, Beijing,
China (diluted 1:300, Product No bs-0701P ).
Staining results were interpreted by two breast
pathologists who were blinded to patient outcomes.
Tumors with 1% or more positively stained nuclei were
considered positive for ER and PR expression. Ki67
staining was determined to be positive when more than
14% of the nuclei were stained [32, 42]. HER-2 was
scored by counting the number of positively stained
cells on the membrane and expressed as a percentage of
total tumor cells according to the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American
Pathologists (CAP) guidelines using the following
categories: 0, no immunostaining; 1+, weak, incomplete
membranous staining in any proportion of tumor cells;
2+, complete membranous staining, either non-uniform
or weak in at least 10% of tumor cells; and 3+, uniform,
intense membranous staining in > 10% of tumor cells.
HER-2 results were considered positive in cases with
3 + membranous staining of IHC or gene amplification by
fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) irrespective of
IHC results using the diagnostic criteria described [43].
A dual semi-quantitative scale combining staining
intensity and percentage of positive cells was used to evaluate
GCS protein staining. The staining intensity of the cell
plasma was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate)
or 3 (strong). The percentage of positive cells was scored as
follows: 0, no staining or staining in < 5% of tumor cells; 1,
staining in 5% to 25% of cells; 2, staining in 26% to 50%
of cells; 3, staining in 51% to 75% of cells; 4, staining in >
75% of cells. For GCS, cytoplasmic staining was considered
positive with an immunohistochemical score ≥ 2, or negative
with an immunohistochemical score < 2 [32].

Materials and Methods
Clinical samples
Tissue samples from 150 patients with primary
invasive ductal breast carcinoma who underwent complete
dissection of the breast and axillary lymph nodes were
collected at the Yuhuangding Hospital affiliated to
Qingdao University, China, between Jan 2011 and
Jun 2012. No patients had preoperative chemotherapy
and informed consent for pathological evaluation
was obtained from all patients prior to surgery. Then
immunohistochemical analyses were adopted to detect
the expression of GCS protein and the methods will be
described in Immunohistochemical analyses. Then 40
cases GCS-positive and 40 cases GCS-negative cases were
selected for our following research.
Patient and tumor characteristics of the 40 GCSpositive and 40 GCS-negative cases are summarized
in Table 2. The use of these tissues was approved by the
Research Ethics Committee of Yuhuangding Hospital, and
we obtained informed written consent for pathological
evaluation from all participants involved in our study.

Ethics statement
The work was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained
from all the patients in this study. All patients signed the
informed consent for use of specimens, and the study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board (Medical
Ethics Committee of Yuhuangding Hospital).

Cell culture
Three drug-sensitive breast cancer cell lines,
MCF-7 (ER-positive, PR-positive, HER-2-negative),
MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative) and T47D (ER-positive,
PR-positive, HER-2-negative), were obtained from the
American National Cancer Institute. The multidrugresistant breast cancer cell line, MCF-7/ADM, was selected
from MCF-7 with doxorubicin treatment in stages [6].
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7/ADM were maintained
in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, USA) medium supplemented with

-3′ (UF), 5′-CCAAACTACAAACTACAAT AACACA-3′
(UR). The size of the non-methylated PCR product was 185
bp and the methylated PCR product was 187 bp. Each MSP
reaction included approximately 100 ng of bisulfite-treated
DNA, 25 pmoles of each primer, 100 pmoles dNTPs, 2.5 μl
10 × PCR buffer and 1 unit of Taq Polymerase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a final reaction volume of 25 µl.
The PCR reaction was as follows: initial denaturation
for 5 min at 94°C; followed by 35 cycles of denaturation
for 30s at 94°C, primer annealing for 30s at 60°C, and
polymerization for 30s at 72°C; and final extension for
10 min at 72°C. MSP products were analyzed by 2%
agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide.
In invasive ductal breast cancer, the MSP products in the M
lanes were scored as methylation, and those in the U lanes

Genomic DNA from 40 paired GCS-positive and GCSnegative cases of primary invasive ductal breast carcinoma
patients and four breast cancer cell lines, was isolated by
proteinase K method. The genomic DNA was modified
with the CpGenomeTM Direct Prep Bisulfite Modification
kit (Millipore, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. MSP primers were designed online (http://
www.urogene.org/methprimer/index1.html).
Primers
were synthesized (Sangon, Shanghai, China) to detect
bisulfate-induced changes affecting methylated (M) and
unmethylated (U) alleles. The MSP primer sequences were
as follows: 5′-TTTTGGTTAATAAGGT GAATTTCG-3′
(MF), 5′-AACCGAACTACGAACTACAATAAC G -3′
(MR) and 5′-GGTT AATAAGGTGAAATTTTGTGCT

were scored as unmethylation [44, 45]. In breast cancer
cells, cells were scored as unmethylation when bands were
present only in the unmethylated DNA lane and as complete
methylation when bands were present in the methylated
DNA lane. Bands present both methylated and unmethylated
lanes were scored as partial methylation [46].

experiments.

5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dc) treatment
Breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
T47D and MCF-7/ADM) were split into low density (30%
confluence) 12 h before treatment. Cells were treated with
5-Aza-dc (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a concentration
of 5 µM for 72 h. At the end of treatment, RNA was
extracted from the cells as described above.

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR
(qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol-Reagent
(Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer,
and quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect
GCS mRNA. qPCR was performed using a SYBR
Green Real-time PCR MasterMix (TOYOBO, Japan).
The primers for GCS were as follows : sense: 5-CCTT
TCCTCTCCCCACCTTCCTCT-3′, antisense:  5′-GGTT
TCAGAAGAGAGACACCTGGG-3′ [47]. The expression
of the β-actin (sense: 5′-ACCCCCACTGAAAAAG
ATGA-3′, antisense: 5′-ATCTTCAAACCTCCATGA
TG-3′) gene was used as an internal control set. The final
volume was 25 µl, and an iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR
Detection System (Bio-Rad) was used for qPCR. The
qPCR reaction was as follows: initial denaturation for
5 min at 94°C; followed by 35 cycles of denaturation
for 30s at 94°C, primer annealing for 30s at 60°C, and
polymerization for 30s at 72°C; and final extension for
10 min at 72°C. The relative mRNA expressions were
calculated using the 2−ΔΔCq method, where ΔΔCq = target
Cq - control Cq; ΔΔCq = ΔCq target - ΔCq calibrator (Cq,
cycle threshold).

Cytotoxicity assay for cell survival (MTS)
The MTS assay was used to assess the effect of
methylation of GCS promoter on the chemosensitivity
of breast cancer cells to anticancer drug [49]. In brief,
cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 5 × 103
cells per well for 24 h, and then incubated with different
concentrations of doxorubicin (Dalian Meilunbio Co.,
Ltd., China) for 24 h. Then 20 μl of MTS was added to
each well and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Optical densities
(ODs) were detected using a spectrometric absorbance of
570 nm against a background of 630 nm on a Bio-Rad
microplate reader (Hercules, CA, USA). The value of
(A570 anticancer drug +/A570 anticancer drug−) × 100%
indicated cell viability. Dose-response curves were plotted
from three independent experiments. The relative drug
resistance was determined by comparing the IC50 (drug
concentration causing 50% inhibition of cell growth) from
growth inhibition curves.

Statistical analysis

Western blot

All calculations were performed using the SPSS16.0
for windows statistical software package (SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA). Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests, and
Pearson correlation coefficient, were used to analyze the
relationship between the expression of GCS and each
histopathological variable. Cellular data were presented
as the mean ± standard deviation. One-way ANOVA
and Dunnett’s T3 tests were used to determine statistical
significance. P-values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

Cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline
and lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaF, fresh
100 μM Na3VO4 and l mM dithiothreitol). Cell lysates were
centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g. Using a previously
described method [48], equal amounts of protein (100 μg)
were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and
transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane. The membranes were blocked with fat-free
milk (5%) in Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween 20 (10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) at room
temperature for 2 h. The membrane was immunoblotted
with rabbit polyclonal against human GCS antibody
(Santa Cruz, USA, diluted 1;1,000) in 5% fat-free milk
in Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween 20. As a control for
equivalent protein loading, the filters were simultaneously
incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody against human
β-actin (diluted 1:1,000). Detection was performed using
enhanced chemiluminescence (Millipore, USA). All
analyses were performed in triplicate in three separate
