Abstract
An interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in the
formation of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein is involved in
the pathogenesis of imatinib-sensitive chronic eosinophilic
leukemia. The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of disease are largely undefined. Human CD34+
hematopoietic progenitor cells were used to investigate the
role of FIP1L1-PDGFRA in modulating lineage development.
FIP1L1-PDGFRA induced both proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils, neutrophils, and erythrocytes in the
absence of cytokines, which could be inhibited by imatinib.
Whereas expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA in hematopoietic stem
cells and common myeloid progenitors induced the formation
of multiple myeloid lineages, expression in granulocytemacrophage progenitors induced only the development of
eosinophils, neutrophils, and myeloblasts. Deletion of amino
acids 30 to 233 in the FIP1L1 gene [FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA]
gave rise to an intermediate phenotype, exhibiting a dramatic
reduction in the number of erythrocytes. FIP1L1-PDGFRA and
FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA both induced the activation of p38 and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in myeloid
progenitors, whereas signal transducers and activators of
transcription 5 (STAT5) and protein kinase B/c-akt were
only activated by FIP1L1-PDGFRA. Dominant-negative
STAT5 partially inhibited FIP1L1-PDGFRA–induced colony
formation, whereas combined inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and ERK1/2 significantly reversed FIP1L1PDGFRA–induced colony formation. Taken together, these
results suggest that expression of FIP1L1-PDFGRA in human
hematopoietic progenitors induce a myeloproliferative phenotype via activation of multiple signaling molecules including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, ERK1/2, and STAT5. [Cancer

Introduction
Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndromes are a rare heterogenous
group of hematologic disorders characterized by an unexplained
persistent eosinophilia exceeding 1.5  109 eosinophils per liter for
more than 6 months in combination with symptoms of organ
damage resulting from eosinophil infiltration (1). Recent studies, in
a subgroup of patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome, identified
a specific interstitial 800 kb deletion on chromosome 4q12
[del(4)(q12g12)], resulting in the formation of a fusion protein

between a previously uncharacterized gene, FIP1-like 1 (FIP1L1)
and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (PDGFRA; ref. 2).
Sequencing of the fusion gene in several patients revealed that the
breakpoint in the PDGFRA gene is conserved and is located in a
small region in exon 12, thereby deleting the extracellular and
transmembrane domain of the receptor. The breakpoint in FIP1L1,
however, is variable and spreads from exon 7 to exon 10 (2, 3),
resulting in fusion proteins differing more than 120 amino acids in
length. The clinical implications of this variability are thus far
unknown.
Chromosomal deletion resulting in the formation of FIP1L1PDGFRA has been observed in 14% to 60% of patients with
hypereosinophilic syndrome (2–7). These patients were diagnosed
with chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) according to the WHO
disease classification criteria and were treated with imatinib, which
results in complete remission in many patients with CEL (8–10).
Imatinib is a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative designed to
inhibit BCR-ABL by association with ATP-binding sites. Imatinib
not only inhibits BCR-ABL, but also inhibits the activity of other
kinases including c-Kit, c-fms, and PDGFR (2, 11–13). Although it
has been shown that FIP1L1-PDGFRA acts as a constitutively active
tyrosine kinase resulting in the activation of signal transducers and
activators of transcription 5 (STAT5; ref. 2), the molecular
mechanisms underlying FIP1L1-PDGFRA–mediated CEL, including
the relevance of STAT5 activation, are at the moment, incompletely
understood.
Recent studies showed that transplantation of interleukin (IL)-5
transgenic mouse hematopoietic progenitors ectopically expressing
FIP1L1-PDGFRA induces a CEL-like phenotype in mice, including
tissue eosinophilia, as observed in humans (14). However, these
studies focused on the effect of expression of the fusion protein on
murine hematopoietic progenitors rather than human hematopoietic progenitors, and did not identify the molecular mechanisms
underlying the development of disease.
We have therefore investigated whether the expression of
FIP1L1-PDGFRA in primary human hematopoietic progenitors
was sufficient to induce hypereosinophilia. In addition, we have
investigated which signal transduction pathways are aberrantly
regulated in primary human hematopoietic progenitors expressing
FIP1L1-PDGFRA and whether these molecules are critical for the
transforming capacity of this fusion protein. Our data shows that
expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA induces the activation of multiple
signaling pathways including STAT5, extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK)1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and
protein kinase B (PKB/c-akt), resulting in cytokine-independent
colony formation. Deletion of amino acids 30 to 233 of FIP1L1
prevents the activation of PKB and STAT5, resulting in an
intermediate phenotype, suggesting that FIP1L1 may play an
important role in the regulation of disease phenotype. These data
have implications for the development of novel therapies targeting
imatinib-resistant CEL.

Isolation and culture of human CD34 cells. Mononuclear cells were
isolated from human umbilical cord blood by density centrifugation over a
Ficoll-Paque solution (density, 1.077 g/mL). MACS immunomagnetic cell
separation (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA) using a hapten-conjugated
antibody against CD34, which was coupled to beads, was used to isolate
CD34+ cells. CD34+ cells were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s
medium (Life Technologies, Paisley, United Kingdom) supplemented
with 8% FCS, 50 Amol/L of h-mercaptoethanol, 10 units/mL of penicillin,
10 Ag/mL of streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L of glutamine at a density of
0.3  106 cells/mL. Cells were cultured either in the presence of stem cell
factor (SCF; 50 ng/mL), and FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3) ligand
(50 ng/mL), or in the presence of SCF (50 ng/mL), FLT-3 ligand (50 ng/mL),
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; 0.1 nmol/L),
IL-3 (0.1 nmol/L), and IL-5 (0.2 nmol/L) to induce eosinophil differentiation.
Retroviral transduction experiments were done 2 days after isolation. Cord
blood samples were collected from healthy donors after informed consent
was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Protocols were
approved by the local ethics committee of the University Medical Center in
Utrecht.
Viral transduction of CD34+ cells. Bicistronic retroviral DNA
constructs were used coexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein
(eGFP) and either FIP1L1-PDGFRA, fusing the NH2-terminal 233 amino
acids of FIP1L1 to the COOH-terminal 523 amino acids of PDGFRA, or
FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA, a fusion gene in which amino acids 30 to 233 of
FIP1L1 were deleted (15). Retrovirus was produced by transient transfection
of the retroviral packaging cell line, Phoenix-ampho, by calcium phosphate
coprecipitation. Cells were plated in 6 cm dishes, 24 h before transfection. A
total of 10 Ag of DNA was used per transfection. Medium was refreshed 16
h after transfection. After an additional 24 h, viral supernatants were
collected and filtered through a 0.2-Am filter. CD34+ cells were transduced
in 24-well dishes precoated with 10 Ag/cm2 of recombinant human
RetroNectin (Takara, Otsu, Japan) for 2 h. Transduction was done with the
addition of 0.5 mL of viral supernatant to 0.5 mL of medium containing 0.5
 106 cells. Twenty-four hours after transduction, 0.7 mL of medium was
removed from the cells and 0.5 mL of fresh virus supernatant was added
together with 0.5 mL of fresh medium.
Isolation of myeloid progenitors. Hematopoietic progenitors were
isolated as described by Manz et al. (16). In short, CD34+ cells were isolated
as described above and cultured for 1 day in the presence of SCF and FLT-3
ligand. Cells were subsequently washed and resuspended in PBS/5% FCS
and incubated for 30 min on ice with a mixture of antibodies (all from
Becton Dickinson, Alphen a/d Rijn, the Netherlands). Lineage markers
included CD2, CD3,CD4, CD7, CD8, CD14, and CD235a. Myeloid progenitors
are negative for these lineage markers. The lineage negative (Lin ), CD34+,
and CD38 populations consist of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Lin ,
CD34+, CD38+, CD123+, and CD45RA cells are common myeloid
progenitors (CMP), whereas Lin , CD34+, CD38+, CD123+, and CD45RA+
cells are granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMP). HSCs, CMPs, and
GMPs were sorted using a FACS ARIA ( from Becton Dickinson). Isotype
antibody staining was used to ensure sorting of the correct population.
Sorting of the different progenitor populations was confirmed by culture of
the individual populations in the presence of SCF, FLT3L, GM-CSF, IL-3,
IL-5, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and erythropoietin to allow
differentiation of all lineages in a colony-forming assay as described below.
Colony-forming unit assay. Retrovirally transduced cells were sorted
from not-transduced cells by flow cytometry and used in colony-forming
unit (CFU) assays. CD34+ cells were plated in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s
medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 35.3% FCS (Hyclone, Logan,
UT), 44.4% methylcellulose-based medium called Methocult (StemCell
Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), 11.1 Amol/L of h-mercaptoethanol, 2.2
units/mL of penicillin, 2.2 Ag/mL of streptomycin, and 0.44 mmol/L of
glutamine at a density of 1,250 cells/well. CFU assays were done either in
the absence of cytokines or in the presence of SCF (50 ng/mL), FLT-3 ligand
(50 ng/mL), GM-CSF (0.1 nmol/L), IL-3 (0.1 nmol/L), and IL-5 (0.2 nmol/L).
Colonies were scored after 12 days of culture. CFU-GEMM (granulocyte/

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

erythrocyte/monocyte/megakaryocyte), CFU-GM (granulocyte/macrophage), CFU-E (erythrocyte), and CFU-Eo (eosinophil) were scored by
May-Grunwald Giemsa staining of cells derived from individual colonies.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was done using standard
techniques. In brief, differentiating granulocytes were lysed in Laemmli
buffer [0.12 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.05 Ag/AL
bromophenol blue, and 35 mmol/L h-mercaptoethanol], and boiled for
5 min. Equal amounts of total lysate were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE.
Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P and incubated with blocking
buffer (TBS/Tween 20) containing 5% low-fat milk for 16 h at 4jC before
incubating with antibodies against either PDGFRA (Santa Cruz, Inc., Santa
Cruz, CA), phosphorylated PKB (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA),
phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated
STAT5a (Cell Signaling Technology), phosphorylated p38MAPK (Cell
Signaling Technology), or an antibody against tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich,
Zwijndrecht, the Netherlands) overnight in the same buffer. Subsequently,
blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for
1 h. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used as a detection method
according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia,
Amersham, United Kingdom).
Statistics. A Levene’s test for equality of variances was done in all
experiments. Subsequently, an independent sample t test was done to
compare the differences in colony numbers, between the controls and cells
transduced with FIP1L1-PDGFRA or FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA. P V 0.05 was
considered significant.

Results
FIP1L1-PDGFRA induces cytokine-independent proliferation and differentiation. To determine whether expression of
the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene is sufficient to recapitulate the
development of CEL in human hematopoietic progenitors,
bicistronic retroviral DNA constructs were used coexpressing eGFP
and either FIP1L1-PDGFRA, or FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA (15), in
which the amino acids 30 to 233 of FIP1L1 were deleted (2). Retrovirus was generated and used to transduce umbilical cord blood–
derived CD34+ cells. Transduced cells were plated in CFU assays,
and colony formation was analyzed after 12 days. The expression of
FIP1L1-PDFGRA in human CD34+ cells dramatically induced
colony formation in the absence of cytokines, whereas the addition
of IL-3 and IL-5, normally required to induce eosinophil differentiation (17), did not further enhance colony numbers (Fig. 1A). The
expression of both FIP1L1-PDGFRA and FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA
induced not only the development of eosinophils but also of
erythrocytes and neutrophils both in the absence of cytokines or in
the presence of IL-3 and IL-5 (Fig. 1B–D), indicating that expression
of the fusion protein itself induces a myeloproliferative phenotype
rather than CEL, this suggests that additional factors are required for
the development of the observed clinical phenotype.
Although the expression of the fusion proteins rendered the cells
cytokine-independent, the cells remained, at least in part, cytokineresponsive. Stimulation of cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRA with
IL-3 and IL-5 induced the number of CFU-Eo colonies (Fig. 1D)
without affecting total colony numbers (Fig. 1A), indicating that IL5 was still important for the induction of eosinophil development
in FIP1L1-PDGFRA–expressing cells.
The role of FIP1L1 in the regulation of FIP1L1-PDGFRA–
mediated transformation is, at the moment, incompletely understood. Whereas previous studies show that fusion of the first 29
amino acids of FIP1L1 to the intracellular domain of the PDGFRA
gene is both necessary and sufficient to induce cytokineindependent proliferation in Ba/F3 cells (2), recent studies suggest
that FIP1L1 is not required to induce cytokine-independent
proliferation of these cells (15). To investigate whether expression

Figure 1. Ectopic expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA and FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA induces cytokine-independent proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils,
neutrophils, and erythrocytes. CD34+ cells were cultured either in the absence of cytokines or in the presence of IL-3 and IL-5 to induce eosinophil differentiation. Cells
were retrovirally transduced to ectopically express FIP1L1-PDGFRA or FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA. A, transduced cells (1,250) were plated into methylcellulose
and colony formation was analyzed after 12 d of culture. The total number of colonies was scored. The total number of erythrocyte colonies (CFU-E; B),

of the FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA fusion protein in human CD34+ cells
gives rise to a similar phenotype compared with the expression of
FIP1L1-PDGFRA, CD34+ cells were retrovirally transduced to
ectopically express either FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA or FIP1L1PDGFRA. Transduced cells were plated in CFU assays, and colony
formation was analyzed after 12 days. Although expression of
FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA in primary human hematopoietic progenitors also induced colony formation in the absence of cytokines, the
number of colonies was reduced compared with cells expressing
FIP1L1-PDGFRA (Fig. 1A), which was predominantly caused by
a significant reduction in the number of erythrocyte colonies
(Fig. 1B). No significant difference was observed in both CFU-GM
and CFU-Eo numbers (Fig. 1C and D).
Partial deletion of FIP1L1 resulted in reduced erythrocyte
development compared with FIP1L1-PDGFRA, suggesting that
FIP1L1 itself is important in the development of the myeloproliferative phenotype observed.
Imatinib inhibits FIP1L1-PDGFRA–induced colony formation, enabling cells to undergo normal differentiation. Patients
diagnosed with FIP1L1-PDGFRA–mediated CEL are currently
treated with imatinib, often resulting in complete remission. In

order to investigate whether imatinib inhibits FIP1L1-PDGFRA–
mediated induction of colony formation, CD34+ cells were
retrovirally transduced to ectopically express FIP1L1-PDGFRA.
Transduced cells were plated into CFU assays either in the absence
or presence of imatinib, and colony formation was analyzed after
12 days. Treatment of human hematopoietic progenitors expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRA with imatinib completely blocked colony
formation in the absence of cytokines, but not in the presence of
IL-3 and IL-5 (Fig. 2A). Normal eosinophil development was
observed in FIP1L1-PGFRA expressing cells cultured in the
presence of IL-3, IL-5, and imatinib compared with control cells
cultured under the same conditions (Fig. 2D). This indicates that
imatinib treatment, rather than inducing apoptosis of transduced
cells, enables cells to normally respond to cytokines. Surprisingly,
the formation of granulocyte-macrophage colonies from CD34+
cells was also inhibited upon treatment with imatinib, suggesting
that long-term treatment of patients might also affect normal
hematopoiesis.

hematopoietic progenitors induces a myeloproliferative phenotype
rather than a phenotype resembling CEL. The cell surface
sialomucin-like adhesion molecule CD34 is expressed on early
hematopoietic cells and is generally used as a marker for HSCs (18).
However, CD34 is not exclusively expressed on HSCs, but is also
expressed in more committed cells such as CMP, GMP, and
megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (16). To investigate whether the expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA in different hematopoietic
progenitor populations gives rise to different phenotypes, hematopoietic progenitors, including HSCs, CMPs, and GMPs were
sorted from CD34+ cells by flow cytometry (16), and subsequently
retrovirally transduced to ectopically express FIP1L1-PDGFRA.
Transduced cells were plated into CFU assays without any
cytokines and colony formation was analyzed after 12 days
(Fig. 3A). Sorting of the different progenitor populations was
confirmed by culturing the individual populations in the presence
of SCF, FLT3L, GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-5, granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor, and erythropoietin to allow differentiation of all lineages in
a colony-forming assay (data not shown). The expression of
FIP1L1-PDGFRA in HSCs and CMPs resulted in the formation of all
myeloid lineages in the absence of cytokines including high

numbers of erythrocyte colonies, whereas expression of the fusion
protein in a Lin , CD34+, CD38+, CD45RA , CD123lo GMP (16)
population only resulted in high numbers of myeloblasts,
neutrophils, and eosinophils (Fig. 3B). This supports the idea that
for FIP1L1-PDGFRA to induce CEL, the translocation is more likely
to occur in a more committed population such as the GMP.
FIP1L1-PDGFRA–induced activation of multiple signal
transduction pathways. The observed differences in FIP1L1PDGFRA and FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA–mediated colony formation
and lineage development suggests differences in activation of
intracellular signal transduction pathways. It has previously been
shown that FIP1L1-PDGFRA induces the activation of STAT5 in
Ba/F3 cells, whereas ERK1/2 did not seem to be a downstream
target of FIP1L1-PDGFRA in this cell line (2). To investigate which
signal transduction pathways are aberrantly regulated in FIP1L1PDGFRA expressing human CD34+ cells, and to better understand
the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed differences in
lineage development caused by the deletion of amino acids 30 to
233 in FIP1L1, CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors were retrovirally
transduced to ectopically express FIP1L1-PDGFRA or FIP1L1(1–
29)-PDGFRA. Transduced cells were sorted from nontransduced

and colony formation was analyzed after 12 d of culture. The total number of colonies was scored. The total number of erythrocyte colonies (CFU-E; B),
granulocyte-macrophage colonies (CFU-GM; C ), and eosinophil colonies (CFU-Eo; D ) were scored.

cells and cell lysates were prepared. Expression of FIP1L1-PDFGRA
induced phosphorylation of STAT5a, ERK1/2, p38MAPK, and PKB
in the absence of cytokines (Fig. 4). Interestingly, whereas
expression of FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA resulted in the activation of
ERK1/2 and p38MAPK, STAT5a and PKB were not, or were
undetectably phosphorylated, providing a potential mechanism for
the differences observed in colony formation between both fusion
proteins.
STAT5 is necessary but not sufficient for FIP1L1-PDGFRA–
induced colony formation. To investigate whether activation of
STAT5a in CD34+ cells ectopically expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRA
plays an important role in the induction of cytokine-independent
colony formation, CD34+ cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRA were
retrovirally transduced with STAT5aD750, a dominant-negative
STAT5a (19). FIP1L1-PDGFRA–mediated colony formation was
inhibited upon the expression of STAT5aD750 (Fig. 5A), however,
dominant-negative STAT5a was insufficient to completely block
colony formation, suggesting that other signal transduction
pathways may play a critical role. This is supported by the
observation that whereas FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA does not activate
STAT5, it is still able to induce some degree of myeloproliferation.
Several studies have shown that activation of STAT5a was
critical for the induction of differentiation in various hematopoietic
lineages including eosinophils, neutrophils (20), and erythrocytes
(21). To investigate whether constitutive activation of STAT5a was
indeed sufficient to induce cytokine-independent colony formation
from hematopoietic progenitors, CD34+ cells were retrovirally
transduced to ectopically express constitutively active STAT5a
(STAT5a1*6; ref. 22) or eGFP as a control. Transduced cells were
sorted from the nontransduced cells and plated in methylcellulose

www.aacrjournals.org

in the absence of cytokines. Constitutive activation of STAT5a
induced the number of colonies (Fig. 5B), including erythrocyte
colonies (Fig. 5C). Colony size, however, was dramatically reduced
compared with FIP1L1-PDGFRA–expressing colonies (data not
shown), suggesting that although STAT5a can play a role in FIP1L1PDGFRA–induced colony formation, the activation of additional
signaling molecules is required for the myeloproliferative phenotype observed.
Combined inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and
ERK1/2 blocks FIP1L1-PDGFRA–induced colony formation. To
investigate whether inhibition of additional signaling pathways
could rescue the FIP1L1-PDGFRA–mediated phenotype, CD34+
cells were retrovirally transduced to express FIP1L1-PDGFRA.
Transduced cells were plated in methylcellulose medium either in
the absence or in the presence of LY294002, SB203580, and U0126,
pharmacologic inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K),
p38MAPK, and ERK1/2, respectively. Whereas colony formation of
FIP1L1-PDGFRA–expressing cells was unaffected by the inhibition
of p38MAPK, inhibition of either PI3K or ERK1/2 modestly
decreased colony numbers both in presence or absence (Fig. 6B)
of IL-3 and IL-5 (Fig. 6A). Importantly, combined inhibition of both
signaling pathways dramatically reduced colony formation, suggesting that combined activation of PI3K, ERK1/2, and STAT5a is
critical for FIP1L1-PDGFRA–mediated cytokine-independent lineage development.

Discussion
In this study, we have investigated for the first time, the
molecular mechanisms underlying FIP1L1-PDGFRA transforming
ability in human hematopoietic progenitor cells. Our data show
that expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA in human hematopoietic
progenitors induces not only eosinophil differentiation, but also
the development of other myeloid lineages including erythrocytes
and neutrophils, resembling a myeloproliferative phenotype.

antibodies against PDGFRA, tubulin phosphorylated PKB, phosphorylated
STAT5, phosphorylated ERK1/2, and phosphorylated p38MAPK.

the presence of IL-5 (Fig. 1F), suggesting that IL-5 may help induce
the phenotype, but is not sufficient.
Besides prolonged hypereosinophilia resulting in end-organ
damage, patients with CEL also show increased serum tryptase
levels and increased levels of atypical mast cells, distinct from
systemic mastocytosis. In addition, distinct features including
anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, splenomegaly, marrow
hypercellularity, and early myeloid precursors in peripheral blood
smear have been observed in these patients (23, 24). Our
experiments show that expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA in HSCs
and CMPs results in the formation of all myeloid lineages, whereas
expression of the fusion protein in a Lin , CD34+, CD38+, CD45RA ,
and CD123lo GMP (16) population only resulted in high numbers
of myeloblasts, neutrophils, and eosinophils without inducing
erythrocyte development (Fig. 3). This supports the idea that the
leukemic stem cell for CEL resides in a more committed population
such as the GMP. However, it has recently been described that the
FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene can be found in both myeloid and

Recently, it has been shown that transplantation of mouse
hematopoietic progenitors from IL-5 transgenic mice ectopically
expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRA induces hypereosinophilia in mice
including organ infiltration (14). In contrast, transplantation of
normal mouse hematopoietic progenitors expressing FIP1L1PDGFRA induces a myeloproliferative phenotype, suggesting that
IL-5 is critical for induction of CEL. In contrast to these
observations, although the addition of IL-5 induced eosinophil
differentiation of human CD34+ cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRA in
our experiments, the total number of eosinophil colonies was
actually slightly decreased compared with control cells cultured in

FIP1L1-PDGFRA Induces Myeloproliferation

lymphoid cells (25), indicating that the initial mutation resulting in
the expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA may also occur in HSCs. Our
experiments suggest that chromosomal translocation resulting in
the expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA would not be sufficient to
induce CEL in the absence of secondary factors or mutations.
Interestingly, others have shown that in a mouse transplantation
model, serial transplantation of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA–mediated
disease was only successful using high cell numbers, suggesting
that the expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA does not induce selfrenewal of hematopoietic progenitors (14). This suggests that
although the initial mutation in patients may occur in HSCs,
secondary mutations resulting in increased self-renewal capacity
should occur in Lin , CD34+, CD38+, CD45RA , and CD123lo GMP
cells or even more committed eosinophil progenitors. Interestingly,
Krivtsov et al. recently described that expression of the MLL-AF9
fusion protein in a committed GMP progenitor was sufficient to
induce leukemia in mice. Although retaining their normal GMP
phenotype, the self-renewal capacity of these cells was induced on
the expression of MLL-AF9, suggesting that reactivation of selfrenewal in committed progenitors is both possible and sufficient to
induce leukemia (26).
Patients diagnosed with FIP1L1-PDGFRA–mediated CEL are
currently treated with imatinib. Although imatinib results in
complete remission in many patients (8–10), clinical observations
suggest that imatinib also affects normal hematopoiesis. For
example, grades 3 to 4 neutropenia has been observed in 14% of
Philadelphia chromosome–positive patients treated with imatinib,
whereas thrombocytopenia and anemia has been observed in 8%
and 3% of these patients, respectively (27). Several in vitro studies
confirm that imatinib can affect normal hematopoiesis. For
example, both differentiation of dendritic cells from mobilized
peripheral blood–derived CD34+ cells (28), as well as proliferation
of T cells (29), are inhibited by imatinib. The normal expansion of
CD34+ cells is also inhibited upon treatment with imatinib (30, 31).
Imatinib, in our experiments, does not induce the apoptosis of
FIP1L1-PDGFRA–expressing cells, but apparently inactivates the
constitutively active tyrosine kinase, enabling cells to undergo
normal differentiation (Fig. 2). This is important for current clinical
therapies and indicates that imatinib treatment should be
continued on remission to prevent relapse of the disease. However,
we also observed that the formation of granulocyte-macrophage
colonies from normal CD34+ cells was inhibited on treatment with
imatinib (Fig. 2), suggesting that long-term treatment of patients
with CEL using imatinib may ultimately result in the development
of additional hematological disorders in these patients.
Expression of FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA in primary human hematopoietic progenitors induced colony formation in the absence of
cytokines, however, the number of erythrocyte colonies was
reduced (Fig. 1). No differences were observed in granulocytemacrophage and eosinophil colony formation. This indicates that
FIP1L1 plays a role in cytokine-independent development of some,
but not all, myeloid lineages. Previous studies showing that FIP1L1
was dispensable for cytokine-independent proliferation were done
in Ba/F3 cells, a mouse pro-B cell line (15).
The function of FIP1L1 is incompletely understood. It could be
hypothesized that FIP1L1 plays an important role in the regulation
of dimerization of the intracellular PDGFRA domain, normally
required for activation, resulting in constitutively active fusion
protein. Dimerization effects, however, are unlikely because a lack of
dimerization would reduce the activation of all signaling pathways.
We have shown that both ERK1/2 and p38MAPK are activated upon

www.aacrjournals.org

expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA and FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFR, whereas
STAT5a and PKB are only activated upon the expression of FIP1L1PDGFRA but not FIP1L1(1–29)-PDGFRA (Fig. 4).
Interestingly, a recent study showed that truncation of the first
tryptophan residue in the juxtamembrane domain of PDGFRA was
sufficient to induce cytokine-independent proliferation of Ba/F3
cells, suggesting that FIP1L1 does not play a role in FIP1L1PDGFRA–mediated transformation (15). This seems to be in
contrast with earlier studies showing that deletion of amino acids 6
to 233 of FIP1L1 results in the expression of a protein unable to
induce cytokine-independent transformation of Ba/F3 cells (2). In
addition, whereas the expression of a PDGFRA deletion mutant
consisting of one tryptophan residue was sufficient to induce
cytokine-independent proliferation, the level of proliferation of
these cells was reduced compared with cells expressing FIP1L1PDGFRA. This suggests that truncation of the juxtamembrane
domain is involved in the induction of transformation, but that
FIP1L1 may be critical for disease pathogenesis in CEL.
Furthermore, although it is evident that the breakpoint in PDGFRA
is located in the juxtamembrane region of most patients, deleting
one tryptophan residue, one patient has been described with a
breakpoint located before the juxtamembrane domain leaving both
tryptophan residues intact (3), suggesting that truncation of
PDFGRA is not always sufficient to induce CEL. Interestingly, a
novel t(4;17)(q12;q21) translocation has recently been discovered in
a case of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia resulting in the
formation of a FIP1L1-RARa fusion protein (32). Because the
dimerization capacity of previously described RARa fusion
partners seems to be critical for the induction of leukemic
transformation, it is likely that FIP1L1 also plays an important role
in the development of disease.
We and others have previously shown that STAT5 plays an
important role in the regulation of the development of various
myeloid lineages (20). In this study, we have shown that STAT5 is
sufficient to induce the development of granulocyte-macrophage
colonies, erythrocyte colonies, and eosinophil colonies in the
absence of cytokines (Fig. 5). Colony size, however, was
dramatically reduced compared with FIP1L1-PDFGRA–expressing
cells, indicating that other signal transduction pathways play an
important role in the regulation of progenitor expansion. Indeed,
combined inhibition of the PI3K and ERK1/2 pathway dramatically reduced FIP1L1-PDGRFA–induced colony numbers (Fig. 6),
suggesting that these pathways play an important role in
controlling FIP1L1-PDGFRA–mediated progenitor expansion. Our
data suggests that although activation of STAT5 may result in
cytokine-independent differentiation, PI3K and ERK1/2 are
needed for the expansion of transformed colonies. Indeed, both
PI3K-PKB and ERK1/2 have been clearly shown to play critical
roles in the regulation of proliferation in a variety of cell systems
(33, 34).
Taken together, our results show that an interstitial deletion on
chromosome 4q12, resulting in the expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA
in human hematopoietic progenitors is sufficient to induce
cytokine-independent myeloproliferation in human CD34+ progenitors. Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying
FIP1L1-PDGFRA–mediated lineage development revealed that
combined activation of multiple signaling molecules including
PI3K, ERK1/2, and STAT5a plays an important role in the induction
of cytokine-independent colony formation.
Imatinib inactivates FIP1L1-PDGFRA, enabling cells to undergo
normal differentiation, indicating that imatinib treatment should

be continued upon remission to prevent relapse of the disease.
However, colony formation of control cells was also inhibited by
imatinib, suggesting that long-term treatment of patients with CEL
using imatinib affects normal hematopoiesis, which may ultimately
result in the development of additional hematologic disorders in
these patients. It is therefore important to develop alternatives for
treatment with imatinib. Because cancer cells become highly
dependent on aberrantly regulated intracellular signaling pathways,
inhibition of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA–induced signaling pathways
might provide future alternative therapies for patients with
