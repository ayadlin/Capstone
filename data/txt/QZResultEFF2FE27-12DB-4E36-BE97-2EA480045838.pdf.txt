Abstract
CD151, a master regulator of laminin-binding integrins (A6B4,
A6B1, and A3B1), assembles these integrins into complexes
called tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. CD151 protein
expression is elevated in 31% of human breast cancers and
is even more elevated in high-grade (40%) and estrogen
receptor–negative (45%) subtypes. The latter includes triplenegative (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2
negative) basal-like tumors. CD151 ablation markedly reduced
basal-like mammary cell migration, invasion, spreading, and
signaling (through FAK, Rac1, and lck) while disrupting
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-A6 integrin collaboration. Underlying these defects, CD151 ablation redistributed A6B4 integrins subcellularly and severed molecular links
between integrins and tetraspanin-enriched microdomains.
In a prototypical basal-like mammary tumor line, CD151
ablation notably delayed tumor progression in ectopic and
orthotopic xenograft models. These results (a) establish that
CD151-A6 integrin complexes play a functional role in basallike mammary tumor progression; (b) emphasize that A6
integrins function via CD151 linkage in the context of
tetraspanin-enriched microdomains; and (c) point to potential relevance of CD151 as a high-priority therapeutic target,
with relative selectivity (compared with laminin-binding
integrins) for pathologic rather than normal physiology.

Introduction
CD151 (SFA-1, PETA-3), one of 33 proteins in the mammalian
tetraspanin protein family (1), is widely expressed on the surface of
many cell types, where it associates strongly with laminin-binding
integrins (a3h1, a6h1, a6h4, and a7h1) and more weakly with a
few additional integrins (2). Hence, CD151 is well positioned to
modulate integrin-dependent cell spreading, migration, signaling,
and adhesion strengthening (3–5). CD151 may function by linking
laminin-binding integrins to other tetraspanins (e.g., CD9,
CD81, CD82, and CD63), signaling molecules (phosphatidylinositol

4-kinase and protein kinase C), and other proteins within
tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (1, 6).
CD151-associated integrins (a3h1, a6h1, and a6h4) play critical
roles in kidney and skin development (7). CD151 itself may support
kidney and skin development and other functions in humans (8).
Mice lacking CD151 are viable and fertile, with no obvious
developmental defects (9) or showing kidney defects (10), depending on genetic background. Under pathologic conditions, CD151null mice showed in vivo defects in wound healing (11) and
angiogenesis (12). Ex vivo analyses of CD151-null cells and tissues
revealed selected alterations in cell outgrowth, migration, aggregation, proliferation, morphology, and signaling (9, 12, 13).
Whereas other tetraspanins suppress tumor cell invasion and
metastasis (14), CD151 promotes tumor malignancy (15), and the
CD151 gene is up-regulated in human keratinocytes during
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (16). In addition, CD151 expression correlated with poor prognosis, enhanced metastasis, or
increased motility in several cancer types (e.g., ref. 17). Removal of
CD151 by antisense, siRNA knockdown, or knockout may affect
the phosphatidylinositol 3¶-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and Rac1 pathways
(12, 18). In addition, CD151 depletion may either increase (12, 19)
or decrease (12, 20) cell motility, whereas effects on cell adhesion
vary from minimal to substantial (12, 13, 20, 21), perhaps due to
effects on integrin activation (21) and/or internalization (20). Thus,
CD151 has diverse and unpredictable functions in different cellular
environments.
At present, little has been done about CD151 in breast cancer.
The a6h4 integrin (after disconnection from hemidesmosome
intermediate filaments) promotes mammary tumor cell motility
and invasion by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway or small GTPase
Rac1/nuclear factor nB (22, 23). a6h4 may also promote mammary
tumorigenesis by amplifying signaling of ErbB family members (24).
In human breast cancers, expression of integrin a6 and/or h4 is
associated with the estrogen receptor–negative basal-like subtype,
high tumor grade, and increased mortality (25–27). Given the
CD151 association with laminin-binding integrins, we hypothesized
that CD151 influences mammary tumor progression. Indeed, we
found elevated CD151 in high-grade and estrogen receptor–
negative tumors, including the ‘‘triple-negative’’ (estrogen receptor,
progesterone receptor, and HER2 negative) basal-type human
breast cancers. CD151 ablation yielded marked alterations in
integrin-mediated cell invasion, migration, and/or spreading in
mammary cell lines (MCF-10A and MDA-MB-231) with basal-like
gene expression patterns (28). We also gained new insights into
CD151 effects on integrin signaling, distribution, and collaboration
with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Supporting the
relevance of these findings, CD151 ablation delayed human mammary tumor progression in mouse xenograft models.

CD151 and a6 Integrins in Breast Cancer

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. The majority of studies were carried out
using immortalized MCF-10A and malignant MDA-MB-231 cells. The
former are well suited for analysis of CD151 effects on migration of
confluent cell monolayers and integrin organization in cell monolayers. The
latter are better suited for studies of cell invasion, epidermal growth factor
(EGF)–stimulated responses, signaling, and tumor progression. Both cell
types are useful for studies of CD151 contributions to integrin molecular
complexes. A few other cell mammary cell lines are also included to
illustrate the generality of the findings. Human basal-like mammary
epithelial cell lines (MCF-10A, MDA-MB-231, BT549, and Hst578; ref. 28)
and J110 (estrogen receptor–positive metastatic mouse mammary line;
ref. 29) were cultured in DMEM or RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS (Life
Technologies, Inc.), 10 mmol/L HEPES, and antibiotics (penicillin and
streptomycin). A Hoechst dye effluxing mammary cell subline (s-MCF-7)
was selected for high sensitivity to EGF. In vivo passaged p-MDA-MB-231
cells were from nude mouse tumors and were treated with control siRNA
(clones C1 and C2) or CD151 siRNA (clones K1, K2, and K3).
Anti-CD151 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) include 5C11, 1A5 (15), and
FITC-conjugated IIG5a (GeneTex, Inc.). Anti-CD9 mAb MM2/57 (unconjugated
and FITC conjugated) was from Biosource. mAbs to tetraspanins CD81
(M38) and CD82 (M104); mAbs to integrin a2 (A2-IIE10), integrin a3
(A3-X8), integrin a6 (GöH3), integrin h1 (TS2/16), and integrin h4 (3E1,
ASC-8); and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the integrin a3A and a6A
cytoplasmic domains were referenced elsewhere (5, 12). Anti-h1 mAb 9EG7
was from PharMingen. Antibodies to FAK, Y397-phosphorylated FAK,
Fyn, Src, and p130Cas were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies
to phosphorylated Src, Lck, and FAK (Y925) were from Cell Signaling
Technology. PI3K inhibitor (Ly294002) was from Calbiochem and mitomycin C was from Sigma.
Human tissue array analyses. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor
samples annotated with pathologic and prediagnosis clinical data were
obtained under an Institutional Review Board (IRB)–approved protocol
(Partners IRB #2000-P-001448) from Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Immunohistochemistry was done on four paraffin tissue microarrays of
124 primary human breast tumors containing two representative 0.6-mm
cores of each tumor and representative cores of normal breast tissues. For
CD151 immunohistochemistry, primary antibody (clone RLM30, Novacostra) was used at 1:50 dilution and detected using DAKO EnVision+ System
(DAKO). Immunoreactivity was scored semiquantitatively by a breast
pathologist (A.R.) using a scale of 0 to 3+, where 1+ staining approximates
that in normal breast myoepithelial cells. Each single intensity score is
based on two tissue cores, with 0 to 1+ indicating low, and 2 to 3+ indicating
high/overexpressed.
siRNA and shRNA targeting. siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon
and used to target human CD151 (#4, GCAGGUCUUUGGCAUGA; #2,
CCUCAAGAGUGACUACAUCUU), a6 integrin (CAAGACAGCUCAUAUUGAUUU), a3 integrin (UUACAGAGACUUUGACCGAUU), CD9 (CCAAGAAGGACGUACUCGAUU), CD81 (CCACCAACCUCCUGUAUCUUU), and CD82
(a pool of four siRNAs). Cells were seeded (1.0  105/mL, 12–20 h) before
siRNA transfection using Lipofectamine 2000. To enhance knockdown, cells
were typically transfected again 2 d later.
For stable knockdown of human CD151, oligo AGTACCTGCTGTTTACCTACA (20) was cloned into lentivirus expression vector plenti-U6BX
(Cellogenetics, Inc.) and verified by DNA sequencing. Viral titers were
determined by HEK 293T cell infection. Infected cells were sorted by flow
cytometry (with mAb 5C11) for CD151 absence.
Matrigel invasion, migration, and spreading assays. To assess
invasion, cells were detached using nonenzymatic EDTA-containing
dissociation buffer (Life Technologies). Then, cells (3  104–5.0  104) in
serum-free DMEM with 0.02% bovine serum albumin (BSA) were added to
transwell chambers containing 8-Am membranes precoated with Matrigel
(BD Biocoat). Chamber bottoms contained serum-free medium F 10 ng/mL
EGF. After invasion through Matrigel (12–18 h, 37jC), membranes were
washed, dried, fixed, and stained (Giemsa, Sigma), and then cells were
counted.

For monolayer scratch assays, 20% to 30% confluent cells in 24-well
plates were transfected with siRNA for 5 d. Confluent cells were starved
for f12 h and gaps were scratched by pipette tip. After removing loose
cells, DMEM/F12 was added, which contained MCF-10A–specific supplement at 1% dilution, F 10 ng/mL EGF. Cell images were acquired with
a monochrome charge-coupled device camera (RT SPOT, Diagnostic
Instruments) on an Axiovert 135 inverted microscope (Zeiss Co.) and
were controlled by IP Lab software (Scanalytics) running on a G4 Macintosh computer. Cell gaps were quantitated using Scion Image vs.62 (Scion
Corp.). For spreading assays, cells (suspended at 37jC, 45 min) were plated
onto 48-well plates precoated with extracellulae matrix substrates and
photographed after 45 min, as indicated above. Cells defined as spread
showed a flattened morphology that was not phase bright by light
microscopy.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. For confocal analyses, cells cultured
on coverslips were treated with siRNAs (5–6 d), stained with various
primary antibodies, then incubated with secondary antibody (FITC- or
Alexa 594–conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rat) alone or combined
(Molecular Probes). Cells were visualized under a Zeiss LSM 510 laserscanning confocal microscope. Using LSM510 Meta software, z-axis images
were acquired at 0.5- to 1-Am increments.
Immunoprecipitation, [3H]-palmitate labeling, and signaling assays.
For metabolic labeling, siRNA-treated cells (80–90% confluent) were washed
in PBS, serum starved (3–4 h), pulsed for 1 to 2 h in medium containing
0.2 to 0.3 mCi/mL [3H]-palmitic acid plus 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum,
and then lysed in 1% Brij-96 for 5 h at 4jC. Immunoprecipitation and
detection of [3H]-palmitate–labeled proteins was as described (12, 30, 31).
To assess protein phosphorylation, cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS),
and then phosphorylated proteins were either immunoprecipitated and
blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, UBI) or directly blotted
in cell lysates using phospho-specific antibodies. Rac1 activation was
assessed with a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PBD pull-down assay kit
(UBI).
Nude mouse xenograft assays. For ectopic analysis, five nude mice
were each injected s.c. at two sites with MDA-MB-231 cells (1  106 per
site). For orthotopic analysis, MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into
mammary fat pads of 10 nude mice (two sites each, 7.5  105 cells
per site). Tumor sizes were measured with calipers and volumes were
calculated (L  W  H  0.52). Animals were maintained until tumors
reached a width of 2 cm or mice became moribund. Apoptotic index
was determined by terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, using the DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega Co.), on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tumor sections.

Results
CD151 in normal and malignant human mammary epithelial cells. Samples of normal and malignant human breast
tissues were analyzed for CD151 protein expression (Fig. 1A).
In normal breast tissue, CD151 was in the basal-myoepithelial
cell layer surrounding both ducts and lobular alveolae (Fig. 1Aa, b). Staining was predominantly cytoplasmic with regions of
basal or basolateral membrane accentuation. By comparison, a
range of CD151 patterns were seen in human breast tumor tissue microarray samples. Some tumors showed absent (score 0,
Fig. 1A-c) or only modest CD151 protein (score 1+, Fig. 1A-d).
Others showed moderate to high CD151 (score 2+, Fig. 1A-e, f; score
3+, Fig. 1A-g, h). CD151 localization varied from predominantly
membranous (Fig. 1A-e, g ) to mostly cytoplasmic (Fig. 1A-f, h).
CD151 was overexpressed in 31% of invasive breast tumors
and significantly correlated with high tumor grade and estrogen
receptor negativity (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1). Estrogen

CD151 effects on mammary cell invasion and motility. For
CD151 functional studies, we focused mostly on two distinct, but
prototypical, myoepithelial-basal derived mammary cell lines:
immortalized MCF-10A and malignant MDA-MB-231. Treatment
with siRNA reduced CD151 protein levels by >90% in MCF-10A
cells, as seen by blotting (Fig. 2A, right), metabolic labeling
(Fig. 5B), or flow cytometry (data not shown). Mobilization of
MCF-10A cells into a gap (scratched into a confluent cell
monolayer) was reduced by nearly 50% for CD151 siRNA–treated

cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2A). Similar results were
obtained when CD151 was stably silenced (>95%) by stable shRNA
expression in MCF-10A cells (data not shown). Knockdown of
integrin a6, but not integrin a3, essentially eliminated motility
(data not shown). Because a6 mostly associates with h4 in
MCF-10A cells (data not shown), motility in Fig. 2A must depend
on integrin a6h4. Neither proliferation nor survival of MCF-10A
cells was affected by CD151 silencing (data not shown).
CD151 was also silenced in MDA-MB-231 cells (>80–90%; Fig. 2B,
right), resulting in 78% reduction of invasion through Matrigelcoated transwell chambers (Fig. 2B). Stable silencing of MDA-MB231 CD151 (by shRNA) yielded similar results (data not shown).
By contrast, silencing of tetraspanins CD82 and CD9 minimally
reduced invasion (Fig. 2B). Although CD9 silencing slightly elevated
MDA-MD-231 invasion (Fig. 2B and C), silencing of CD9 and CD151
together mimicked the CD151 effect (Fig. 2C), suggesting that
CD151 silencing is dominant. We also silenced CD151 (by f90%)

in malignant mouse breast cancer J110 cells. Again, invasion
through Matrigel was significantly reduced (Fig. 2D). Knockdown
of a6 integrin protein (by 80–90%; data not shown) also caused a
>50% reduction in invasion by J110 cells (Fig. 2D), and a6 integrin
silencing caused a >47% decrease in invasion by MDA-MB-231 cells
(data not shown). Hence, CD151 contributes considerably to a6
integrin–dependent motility and invasion in multiple mammary
cell lines.
CD151 effects on integrin-dependent cell spreading and EGF
stimulation. MDA-MB-231 cells spread on laminin-1 in an
integrin-dependent manner (i.e., spreading was blocked by anti–
integrin a6 antibody; data not shown). This spreading was
increased (f31–63%) on stimulation with EGF, which can activate
integrin functions (Fig. 3A and B). By contrast, cells lacking CD151
showed lower initial spreading (f8%) that was not stimulated by
EGF (Fig. 3A and B). CD151 ablation did not affect cell spreading
on fibronectin (Fig. 3C), and MDA-MB-231 cells did not spread on

Figure 2. CD151 supports mammary
epithelial cell migration and invasion. A, after
treatment with siRNAs, MCF-10A cells, grown
to confluence, were then incubated in a 24-well
plate with serum-free medium containing
10 Ag/mL mitomycin C at room temperature for

monolayers, 0.5 mL of serum-free medium
containing 10 ng/mL EGF was added, and
gaps were evaluated after 0 and 18 h at 37jC.

CD151 (mAb 1A5) and h-actin. B, after

(5  104) in serum-free medium containing

Serum-free medium (0.75 mL) containing
10 ng/mL EGF and 0.1% BSA was added to the

Figure 3. CD151 effects on EGF-stimulated
mammary cell spreading and invasion. A, after
siRNA treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells were
suspended in serum-free medium at 37jC for
45 min, and then plated onto laminin-1– or
fibronectin (Fn )-coated 24-well plates with or
without EGF (10 ng/mL). After 45 min,
representative fields were photographed.
B, percentages of spread cells were
determined (n = 4). Note: No cell spreading
was observed on plastic surfaces coated with
BSA (data not shown). C, invasion was also
analyzed (as in Fig. 2B) with or without EGF
(10 Ag/mL) added to the bottom of the invasion
chamber. After tumor formation in nude mice,
MDA-MB-231 cells were reisolated (now called
p-MDA-MB-231). These passaged sublines
were isolated from tumors originating from
MDA-MB-231 cells that had been treated with
control shRNA (C1 ) or CD151 shRNA (K1 and
K2; see also Fig. 6C ). D, a subline of MCF-7
was enriched for Hoechst dye exclusion and
elevated EGFR (now called s-MCF-7) and was
analyzed for invasion as in C .

BSA-coated surfaces (data not shown). EGF stimulation also failed
to rescue defective Matrigel invasion caused by CD151 ablation, as
seen in p-MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3C), s-MCF-7 (Fig. 3D), and BT549
(data not shown) cells. In these multiple mammary cell lines,
invasion was stimulated by EGF when CD151 was present, but was
not stimulated when CD151 was ablated. Two additional
stimulators, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and insulinlike growth factor I (which also activate integrins via inside-out
signaling), showed similar inability to overcome CD151 depletion
effects on MDA-MB-231 cell invasion and spreading (data not
shown).
CD151 affects cell signaling. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells
with 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)-pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine, a specific inhibitor of Src family kinases, completely
abolished cell spreading on laminin-1 substrate (data not shown),
suggesting a role for Src family kinase–mediated tyrosine
phosphorylation. Within 30 to 60 minutes after plating on
laminin-1, CD151-silenced MDA-MB-231 cells showed reduced
tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 4A), a kinase crucial for
tumor invasion (32). Surprisingly, CD151 ablation did not affect
activation of src (which typically modulates FAK), as assessed
by blotting with anti-pY416 (present in Src, Fyn, and Yes kinases),
after cell plating on laminin-1 or fibronectin (data not shown).
Phosphorylation of FAK-Y925, which is mediated by Src (33), was
also unaffected (data not shown), although overall FAK tyrosine

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

phosphorylation was diminished (Fig. 4A). However, CD151
ablation did diminish activation (at Y505) of lck, an Src family
kinase member implicated in mammary tumor progression (ref. 34;
Fig. 4A, bottom).
The Rac and Akt signaling pathways exert major influence on
cell morphology, motility, and migration (35, 36). Consistent with
this, CD151 ablation markedly reduced integrin-dependent Rac1
activation in MDA-MB-231 cells plated on Matrigel for 30 minutes
(Fig. 4B). However, Akt activation was not notably altered in
CD151-silenced cells plated on Matrigel (Fig. 4B), although CD151
and associated integrins modulate Akt activation in other cell
types (see Discussion) and the PI3K/Akt pathway is critical for
MDA-MB-231 cell invasion (37).
CD151 affects integrin subcellular distribution, but not
expression levels. We assumed that the CD151 effects seen in
Figs. 2–4 arise due to CD151 effects on laminin-binding integrins.
However, silencing of CD151 did not affect either the surface
expression or activation of a6h1, a3h1, or a6h4 on either MCF-10A
or MDA-MB-231 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, amounts
of a3 and a6 integrins were unchanged, as seen by biosynthetic
labeling and immunoblotting (Fig. 5B). Hence, although CD151
can closely associate with laminin-binding integrins such as a3h1
and a6h4, it is not required for their expression or activation.
Next, we analyzed CD151 ablation effects on integrin distribution
in MCF-10A cells. As seen in ventral sections, integrin a6 and

CD151 are present in broad patches aligned near cell-cell
boundaries (Fig. 5A, a–c). However, CD151 depletion markedly
diminished this pattern of staining as bands of a6 became thinner
and more proximal to cell-cell boundaries, whereas CD151 staining
itself was greatly diminished (Fig. 5A, d–f ). By contrast, CD151
depletion minimally affected integrin a3 staining (Fig. 5A, compare
g–i with j–l) and did not affect integrin a2 staining (Fig. 5A-m, n).
Hence, CD151 markedly affects the subcellular distribution of a6
integrins (which in this case is mostly a6h4).
CD151 affects integrin associations with other proteins.
CD151 may link laminin-binding integrins to other proteins within
the plasma membrane (38, 39). Hence, we tested whether CD151
depletion would disconnect a3 and a6 integrins from cell-surface
partners. Metabolic labeling with [3H]-palmitate was carried out
because tetraspanins and many of their partner proteins are
typically palmitoylated, and this method of labeling has proved to
be more informative than other types of labeling (12, 30, 31). From
[3H]-palmitate–labeled MCF-10A lysate, recovery of a6h4 integrin
was not diminished on ablation of CD151 [Fig. 5B, lanes 5–7; see
h4 (top) and a6 immunoblot (third row)]. However, recovery was

diminished for CD151 itself, tetraspanins CD9 and CD81, and at
least five other proteins (white arrowheads, lane 6). Similarly,
immunoprecipitation of a3 integrin was not diminished (Fig. 5B,
second row, lanes 2–4), but levels of CD151 and nearly all other
associated proteins were decreased (Fig. 5B, top, lane 3 ).
Diminished recovery of CD9 as an integrin partner, due to CD151
ablation, was confirmed by CD9 immunoblotting (see Figs. 5B,
bottom, lanes 2, 3 and 5, 6). In addition, immunoprecipitation of a6
integrin yielded a small amount of a3 (Fig. 5B, second row, lanes 5
and 7), which was lost when CD151 was ablated (lane 6), whereas
a2 integrin yielded no prominent proteins, consistent with a2 not
associating with tetraspanins (Fig. 5B, lane 1). As shown here for
MCF-10A cells (Fig. 5B), a3 and a6 integrin complexes were
similarly disrupted on CD151 ablation in MDA-MB-231 cells (data
not shown). Together, these results strongly support a critical role
for CD151 in linking a3 and a6 integrins to multiple components
within tetraspanin-enriched microdomains.
CD151 accelerates MDA-MB-231 tumor progression in vivo.
Soft agar assays were carried out using 5,000 and 10,000 MDA-MB231 cells per 60-mm dish. No differences were observed in colony
numbers, size of colonies, or rate of colony development between
control and CD151-knockdown cells. Next, we tested whether
CD151 affects tumor progression in vivo, using MDA-MB-231 nude
mouse xenograft models. In a preliminary ectopic (s.c.) injection
experiment, nude mice were injected with MDA-MB-231 cells
expressing either control shRNA or CD151 shRNA. Tumors arising
from control MDA-MB-231 cells appeared by 8 to 9 weeks, whereas
CD151-ablated cells did not yield detectable tumors until 11 to
12 weeks (Fig. 6A). MDA-MB-231 cells were also injected into
mammary fat pads, and primary tumor growth was analyzed
(Fig. 6B). Again, tumor appearance and growth were markedly
delayed (by 4–5 weeks) in mice injected with CD151-ablated cells.
However, analysis of H&E-stained slides from several tumors
revealed no obvious morphologic differences between tumors
formed from CD151-positive and CD151-ablated MDA-MB-231
cells. In addition, from several representative tumors, formalinfixed paraffin-embedded slides were prepared, and TUNEL staining
was carried out to detect apoptotic cells. Although there was a
trend toward a higher apoptotic index in CD151-ablated tumors,
results did not reach statistical significance (data not shown). In
addition, cells were recovered from independent MDA-MB-231
tumors from both control mice (C1 and C2) and CD151-knockdown
mice (K1, K2, and K3) and then cultured in vitro. Blotting of CD151
confirmed that control MDA-MB-231 cells indeed contained
abundant CD151, whereas CD151-ablated cells expressed little or
no CD151 (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Figure 4. Impact of CD151 ablation on integrin-mediated tyrosine
phosphorylation cascade. A, after siRNA treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells were
detached, washed, and suspended in serum-free DMEM containing 0.1%
BSA. Cells were then kept in suspension for 45 min at 37jC to remove residual
growth factor effects before being plated on laminin-1. At the indicated times,
cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. After immunoprecipitation of FAK from
MDA-MB-231 cells, we analyzed FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (mAb 4G10) and
total FAK by immunoblotting. Total cell lysates were also probed for activated
Lck (p-Y505-Lck), total Src, and tubulin. B, to assess activation of small GTPase
Rac1, cell lysates (prepared as in A ) were incubated with GST-PBD beads
(45 min, 4jC) to recover activated Rac1 (Rac1-GTP form). Beads were washed
and boiled, and released proteins were blotted with anti-Rac1 antibody (top ).
Total Rac1 protein in lysates was also blotted to serve as a control (bottom ). Note
that the observed increase in total Rac1 is due to unequal dilution of starting
lysates; the actual amount of Rac1 is unchanged. Activated Akt (p-Akt) and total
Akt were also blotted with antibodies to phospho-Akt (p-S473) and total Akt.

A role for CD151 in breast cancer had not previously been
shown. Here we show that CD151 overexpression occurs, at least
to some extent, in all subtypes of human breast cancer, with
expression most significantly elevated in patient tissue samples
that were of high grade and/or of the estrogen receptor–negative
type. Among estrogen receptor–negative samples, CD151 was
elevated most frequently in triple-negative basal-like tumors. Here
we focused mostly on the role of CD151 in basal-like cells. Its role
in other types of mammary cells and tumors will be addressed
elsewhere.
Not only is CD151 significantly up-regulated in basal-like human
breast cancer samples but it also seems to play a functional role.

CD151 depletion, via RNA interference, caused a marked delay in
tumor formation by MDA-MB-231 cells, as seen in both ectopic and
orthotopic xenograft models. Hence, CD151 seems to accelerate
mammary tumor progression in this basal-type cell line. Elevated
CD151 expression was previously linked to poor prognosis in
human lung (40) and prostate cancers (17). However, CD151 had
not previously been shown to promote in vivo tumor progression in
breast cancer or in any other type of cancer. Depletion of CD151
had no effect in vitro on proliferation or survival of MDA-MB-231
cells. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that MDA-MB-231
tumor morphology was not altered, and apoptosis was not
significantly increased in tumors formed from CD151-ablated cells.
Hence, CD151 most likely affects the early stages of MDA-MB-231
tumor formation, in which cells initially encounter the extracellular
matrix and invade into surrounding mammary fat pad tissue.

Consistent with this, CD151 indeed affected the invasion and
migration by basal-like mammary cells.
To learn how CD151 functions, we carried out in vitro studies
using two different human basal-like mammary cell lines
(immortalized MCF-10A and malignant MDA-MB-231 cells), with
supporting results obtained using a few other cell lines. On ablation
of CD151, but not other tetraspanins, MDA-MB-231 cell invasion
through Matrigel was decreased by >80%. Support of invasion by
CD151 is consistent with in vitro results seen in other tumor cell
types (17, 40). In MCF-10A cells, removal of CD151 markedly
impaired cell migration, consistent with a promigratory role for
CD151 in epidermal carcinoma cells (20) but contrasting with
antimigratory roles for CD151 in other cells (12, 19). CD151 is
known to support adhesion strengthening (5), and cell migration is
biphasic with respect to adhesion strength. Hence, we suggest that

Figure 5. CD151 affects the molecular organization of integrins. A, MCF-10A cells were initially seeded onto coverslips and treated with siRNAs for 5 d. Live MCF-10A
cells were incubated with primary anti-integrin antibodies for 1 h at 4jC and then stained with Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated secondary antibody. After washing,
cells were further stained with FITC-conjugated CD151 antibody. After staining, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (20 min, 4jC) and mounted on slides
using Prolong antifade solution (Molecular Probes) and then ventral sections were visualized by confocal miscopy. Antibodies used were mAb GoH3 (integrin a6; a and
d), mAb X8 (integrin a3; g and j), mAb IIE10 (integrin a2; m and n), and mAb 5C11 (CD151; c, f, i, and l). Right, merged green and red staining. Ventral sections of
cells were visualized by confocal microscopy. a–c, g, h, and m, treated with control siRNA; d–f, j–l, and n, treated with CD151 siRNA. Bar, 50 Am. B, MCF-10A
cells were treated with siRNAs, labeled with [3H]-palmitate, and then lysed in 1% Briji-96 buffer. Immunoprecipitations of a2, a3, and a6 integrins and CD151 were carried
out with mAbs IIE10, X8, GoH3, and 5C11. Note that the integrin h1 subunit does not appear because it does not undergo palmitoylation. Bottom, immunoblots for a3,
a6, and CD9, present in the immunoprecipitated complexes. The identity of CD81 (top ) was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). We assume that the
band just below CD81 is claudin-1 because it is known to be palmitoylated and it associates closely with CD9 (50) and thus would be recruited via CD151 into a complex
with a3 and a6 integrins.

CD151 and a6 Integrins in Breast Cancer

Figure 6. CD151 accelerates tumor formation in vivo.
A, MDA-MB-231 cells expressing either control or CD151
shRNA were then injected s.c. into nude mice, and
tumor formation was monitored. B, MDA-MB-231 cells
expressing shRNA were injected into mammary fat pads
of nude mice. Mice were terminated when they became
moribund or when tumors reached 2 cm (in any
dimension). Statistical significance was analyzed with
the log-rank test. C, after tumor formation in nude mice,
MDA-MB-231 cells were reisolated and cultured in vitro .
From these sublines (C1 and C2 from control-shRNA
expressing cells; K1, K2, and K3 from CD151-knockdown
cells), cell lysates were prepared and blotted for CD151
(with mAb 1A5) and integrin a3 (with rabbit polyclonal
antibody).

removal of CD151 may either impair or enhance cell migration
depending on whether initial adhesion strength conditions are
optimal or excessive, respectively.
CD151 closely associates with laminin-binding integrins (a3h1,
a6h1, and a6h4) and affects their functions (3–5). Using mammary
cell lines, we found CD151 association with a3h1, a6h1 and a6h4
integrins, and silencing of CD151 affected cell migration, invasion,
spreading, and signaling on laminin, but not fibronectin. In our
studies, depletion of CD151 from MDA-MB-231 cells mostly
modulated a6 integrin functions. Elsewhere, MDA-MB-231 invasion
and migration were shown to be a6h4 dependent (e.g., ref. 41).
However, we cannot rule out contributions also from a3h1. Like
CD151, laminin-binding integrins play a functional role in
mammary tumors (24, 42). Furthermore, like CD151, lamininbinding integrins are elevated in human breast cancer (26), with
a6h4 being a major marker of estrogen receptor–negative basal-like
mammary tumors (25, 43).
Thus far, little insight has emerged about the mechanisms by
which CD151 affects integrins. Although CD151 expression might
affect integrin turnover (20), neither we nor others (12, 20, 21)
observed any effect on integrin expression levels. Results elsewhere
have suggested that the effects of CD151 on a3h1 integrin
activation might underlie its effects on cell adhesion (21). However,
removal of CD151 did not diminish an integrin h1 epitope
commonly associated with integrin activation (data not shown).
Here we show that CD151 affects the distribution and biochemical
organization of a6 integrins on mammary cell lines. On MCF-10A
cells, removal of CD151 altered a6 integrin localization to the cell
periphery. Removal of CD151 also diminished the associations of
a6 and a3 integrins with at least five other proteins, including other
tetraspanins (CD9 and CD81). These results are consistent with
CD151-integrin complexes functioning in the context of a larger
constellation of proteins known as tetraspanin-enriched micro-

www.aacrjournals.org

domains (1, 6). Major alterations in the integrin microenvironment,
due to CD151 depletion, help to explain changes in integrin-dependent cell migration, invasion, spreading, and signaling.
On CD151 silencing, we observed diminished signaling through
Rac1 and FAK in MDA-MB-231 cells plated on laminin-1. Because
Rac1 and FAK typically play critical roles during invasion and
migration, these results are consistent with CD151 silencing
affecting mammary cell invasion and migration. Laminin-binding
integrins and CD151 itself (12) can also markedly affect signaling
through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Indeed, treatment of MDA-MB-231
cells with PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 almost completely abolished
spreading and migration on laminin-1 substrate (data not shown).
Hence, it was surprising that CD151 depletion did not decrease Akt
signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells. One possibility is that the
abundance of constitutively activated Ras found in MDA-MB-231
cells (44) maintains Akt in an activated state regardless of CD151.
In an unexpected finding, CD151 ablation decreased activation of
Lck but not Src (or Fyn or Yes). Although Src typically contributes
to FAK signaling, Lck can also contribute (45), suggesting that
CD151 depletion in MDA-MB-231 cells may impair Lck-FAK rather
than Src-FAK signaling. Lck was recently implicated as playing a
role during mammary tumor progression (34). Thus, decreased
signaling through Lck may also contribute to the functional effects
of CD151 depletion on MDA-MB-231 cells.
Functional and physical collaboration between a6 integrins and
ErbB receptors has been noted (46, 47). For example, EGF
stimulation of epithelial cells disrupts hemidesmosomes, releasing
a6h4 to participate in cell motility and invasion (46, 48). We have
not observed direct physical association of a6 integrins with ErbB
receptors. Nonetheless, three results suggest that CD151 depletion
disrupts integrin collaboration with EGFR: (a) Ablation of CD151
diminished EGF-dependent MCF-10A cell migration. (b) CD151
removal caused cell invasion and spreading deficits (in three

different cell types) that could not be overcome by adding EGF,
and in fact, (c) EGF no longer stimulated cell spreading and/or
migration at all in CD151-silenced cells. These results are
particularly relevant for basal-like mammary tumors because they
tend to show elevated EGFR (25). Phorbol ester treatment also did
not overcome CD151-knockdown effects on cell invasion and
spreading (data not shown). Impaired responses to EGF and PMA,
arising from CD151 silencing, again may be due to disruption of
the a6 integrin microenvironment. In this regard, EGFR and
protein kinase C (a target of PMA) have previously been linked to
tetraspanins such as CD82, CD81, and CD9 (1, 49). Hence, ablation
of CD151 may lead to diminished integrin proximity for these other
tetraspanins and their associated signaling molecules.
In conclusion, we show here that CD151 is significantly elevated
in multiple subtypes of breast cancer, including the basal-like
subtype. Using prototype basal-like mammary cell lines, we show
that CD151 contributes to mammary tumor progression. Whereas
we mostly focused on basal-like mammary cells, CD151-depletion
also affected invasion and/or EGF responsivity for two estrogen
receptor–positive mammary cell lines [murine J110 cells (29) and
an EGF-sensitive subline of MCF-7]. These results suggest that

CD151 can also contribute to other types of breast cancer. In terms
of mechanism, CD151 determines the molecular organization of
laminin-binding integrins on the cell surface, thereby affecting
integrin-dependent mammary cell morphology, migration, invasion, adhesion, signaling, EGFR cross talk, and ultimately, tumor
progression in vivo. A previous study showed that CD151 could
enhance tumor progression by supporting pathologic angiogenesis
in host mice (12). Now we show that tumor cell CD151 also plays a
key role, thus pointing to multiple levels of CD151 contributions,
and emphasizing that CD151 may be a high-priority therapeutic
target in certain breast cancers.
