ABSTRACT
Overcoming platinum drug resistance represents a major clinical challenge in
cancer treatment. We discovered a novel drug combination using cisplatin and a class
of thioquinazolinone derivatives including mdivi-1 (mitochondrial division inhibitor-1),
that induces synergistic apoptosis in platinum resistant tumor cells, including those
from cisplatin-refractory endstage ovarian cancer patients. However, through study
of the combination effect on Drp1 (the reported target of mdivi-1) knockout MEF
cells and the functional analysis of mdivi-1 analogs, we revealed that the synergism
between mdivi-1 and cisplatin is Drp1-independent. Mdivi-1 impairs DNA replication
and its combination with cisplatin induces a synergistic increase of replication stress
and DNA damage, causing a preferential upregulation of a BH3-only protein Noxa.
Mdivi-1 also represses mitochondrial respiration independent of Drp1, and the
combination of mdivi-1 and cisplatin triggers substantial mitochondrial uncoupling
and swelling. Upregulation of Noxa and simultaneous mitochondrial swelling causes
synergistic induction of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP),
proceeding robust mitochondrial apoptotic signaling independent of Bax/Bak. Thus,
the novel mode of MOMP induction by the combination through the “dual-targeting”
potential of mdivi-1 on DNA replication and mitochondrial respiration suggests a
novel class of compounds for platinum-based combination option in the treatment of
platinum as well as multidrug resistant tumors.

INTRODUCTION

neck cancers [1]. The major limitations for the clinical
application of these platinum drugs are their inherent
toxicities, as well as, the high incidence of intrinsic and
acquired drug resistance by tumors [2, 3]. Development
of cisplatin resistance is often associated with multidrug
resistant phenotype. In particular for ovarian cancer,
which is the leading cause of death from gynecologic

cisplatin and carboplatin, are currently among the most
potent and widely used chemotherapeutic agents. They

malignancies, platinum compounds-based therapies
are the current global standard [4]. The initial treatment
response rate to cisplatin in ovarian cancer patients can
be up to 70% [5]. Unfortunately, 70% of those patients
who responded to cisplatin experience disease recurrence
and eventually develop resistance to therapy, resulting in
incurable disease [6]. Platinum resistance is the single
most important factor after stage in determining prognosis.
The anticancer activity of cisplatin appears to rely
on multiple mechanisms. The uptake of cisplatin by
cells is believed to occur by both passive diffusion and
a transporter-mediated process such as through copper
transporter 1 (CTR1) [7]. Once inside the cell cisplatin
undergoes a series of aquation reactions, in which one
or both its cis-chloro ligands are replaced by water
molecules due to the relatively low concentration of
intracellular chloride ions, leading to the generation of
positively charged highly reactive aquated cisplatin [8].
Aquated cisplatin is prone to interact with a number of
intracellular macromolecules, and the most prominent
mechanism underlying cisplatin-induced cell death has
been demonstrated to be through formation of cisplatinDNA adducts. The platinum atom binds to the N7
position of adjacent purines, primarily guanine to form
1, 2 intrastrand cross-links (PtGpGs), leading to the
generation of DNA inter- and intra-strand adducts as well
as DNA-protein complexes [8]. Cisplatin-induced intrastrand adducts are recognized and removed by nucleotide
excision repair (NER) [9]. Cisplatin-induced DNA damage
activates ATR (ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)- and
RAD3-related protein), leading to cell cycle arrest in
the G2 phase [1]. When DNA damage is extensive and
persistent, cells may undergo mitochondria-mediated
apoptotic cell death [2]. The molecular mechanisms of
platinum drug resistance have not been fully elucidated.
It is generally considered that the resistance has multiple
mechanisms depending on cell types and commonly more
than one resistance mechanism is involved [1]. Cisplatin
resistance can be the result of alterations in any of the
steps required for cisplatin action, and has been attributed
to reduced cellular accumulation of cisplatin, enhanced
repair activities against cisplatin-DNA adducts, increased
tolerance to cisplatin-induced DNA damage, and failure of
apoptotic pathway.
Small molecule inhibitors such as ATR and PARP
inhibitors, which prevent repair of cisplatin-induced
DNA lesions, when combined with cisplatin have shown
promise both preclinically and clinically [10, 11]. As
chemosensitizers, such small molecules provide vital
therapeutic approach in managing certain types of tumors.
We have shown previously that mdivi-1, an inhibitor
of mitochondrial division protein Drp1, induces gross
genome instability in tumor cells [12]. Mdivi-1 has been
reported to block the self-assembly of Drp1 and retard
apoptosis by preventing Bax/Bak-dependent mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) [13]. Due to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

its safety and protective benefits that have been shown
in vitro and in vivo [14-17], mdivi-1 represents a novel
class of therapeutics for stroke, myocardial infarction and
neurodegenerative diseases [13].
In this study, we present a novel finding that the
combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1 possesses unusual
anticancer potency by acting synergistically in inducing
robust apoptosis in cisplatin and multidrug resistant
tumor cells, in a Drp1-independent manner. We identified
that mdivi-1 directly causes replication stress and
mitochondrial dysfunction. In combination with cisplatin,
these effects were greatly enhanced leading to synergistic
induction of MOMP independent of Bax and Bak. Since
loss of Bax and Bak causes complete resistance to cisplatin
[18], the ability of our combination strategy in inducing
MOMP in a Bax/Bak-independent manner appears to be
a crucial mechanism in overcoming cisplatin resistance.

RESULTS
Combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1 produces a
synergistic pro-apoptotic effect in tumor cells that
have inherent or acquired resistance to cisplatin
We have shown previously that mdivi-1 induces
genome instability in several types of cancer cells
including MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells [12].
MDA-MB-231 cells are hormone receptor- and ERBB2negative “triple negative” and multidrug resistant [19].
Currently no tailored therapy exists for such type of cancer
[11]. We therefore used MDA-MB-231 cells as a model
to identify chemotherapeutic agents that when combined
with mdivi-1 are able to reverse the drug resistance in
these cells. By using a caspase-3/7 activity assay, we
tested the effect of combining mdivi-1 with a series of
clinically highly significant drugs with disparate actions,
and found that cisplatin is a unique agent whose effect can
be greatly enhanced by mdivi-1 (Fig. 1).
In order to understand the interactions between
cisplatin and mdivi-1, we performed a thorough
characterization of their combination effect. Mdivi-1
alone inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells with an
IC50 of 55.93 ± 1.92 μM (Fig. 2A). The IC50 of cisplatin
for MDA-MB-231 cells is 14.29 ± 1.03 μM (Fig. 2B). In
the presence of mdivi-1, the survival curve was shifted
towards the left dose-dependently compared to cisplatin
alone treatment (Fig. 2B), indicating that mdivi-1 is able
to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin and reduce the doses of
effective cisplatin into low micromolar range. The nature
of the interactions between cisplatin and mdivi-1 was
further evaluated based on the median-effect principle of
Chou and Talalay [20]. The value of the combination index
(CI), which is 0.42 for the drugs combined at their IC50
and 0.18 at 0.5 fold of their IC50 (Fig. 2C), indicated that

effect. Furthermore, a short-term two-hour exposure
of cells to the combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1 is
sufficient to dramatically decrease cell number within 24
h (70% reduction compared to cisplatin alone treatment)
(Fig. 2D), indicating rapid induction of cell death. This
is in sharp contrast to the two-hour exposure of cells to
cisplatin alone, which only caused a slight delay in cell
growth. Cleavage of caspase-3 was then used to quantify
apoptotic cell death. A 20 h treatment with the combination
of cisplatin and mdivi-1 at 1:1 ratio at 20 μM or higher
triggered a dramatic increase in the number of apoptotic

cells (Fig. 2E). It is also noteworthy that the synergism
we observed in MDA-MB-231 cells is highly significant
compared to certain known platinum-based combinations,
as those cells are also resistant to the combination of
cisplatin with promising molecular targeted strategies
such as inhibition of ATR and PARP (Supplemental Fig.
1). The synergistic effect was also demonstrated by a dose
matrix response assay in MDA-MB-231 cells and other
types of cancer cells with inherent cisplatin resistance,
such as non-small cell lung carcinoma H1299 cells (Fig.
2F), glioblastoma, head and neck, and melanoma cells
(Supplemental Fig. 2). Furthermore, another platinum

measuring the activity of caspase-3/7. The drugs tested were platinum agent, cisplatin; antifolate agent, methotrexate; topoisomerase II

analog carboplatin was also found to have similar
combination effect with mdivi-1 (Supplemental Fig. 3).
We also found that the combination effect is not dependent
on p53 status of the cells (Supplemental Fig. 4).
Since acquired cisplatin resistance is also a major
obstacle to successful platinum-based therapy, we next
tested the effect of the combination on tumor cells with
acquired cisplatin resistance. The A2780cis ovarian cancer

cell line (left panel of Fig. 3A) is a cisplatin-resistant
A2780 derivative, established by chronic exposure of the
parental cisplatin-sensitive A2780 cell line (established
from ovarian epithelial tumor tissue from an untreated
patient) to increasing concentrations of cisplatin. A2780cis
is also cross-resistant to melphalan, adriamycin and
irradiation. Similarly as we observed in Fig. 2B, mdivi-1
greatly increased cisplatin efficacy in A2780cis cells (right

panel of Fig. 3A). Ovarian cancer patients with ascites are
more frequently platinum resistant than patients without
ascites [21]. The ex vivo drug sensitivity assay using
tumor cells isolated from patient ascites is capable of
predicting outcomes of patients and assisting oncologists
in making treatment decision selecting assay-sensitive
agents [22]. We thus tested the effect of the combination
of cisplatin and mdivi-1 on primary epithelial ovarian
cancer (EOC) cells derived from patient ascites fluids. In
Fig. 3B, primary EOC cells were isolated from the ascites
of a patient who had not been treated with cisplatin but
showed relative resistance to cisplatin (IC50 ≈ 7.97 μM).
In Fig. 3C, primary EOS cells were isolated from a patient

who had developed clinically-defined cisplatin resistance
due to previous treatments (IC50 ≈ 11.64 μM). Both the
caspase-3/7 activity assay and MTS assay revealed that the
combination with mdivi-1 dramatically enhanced cisplatin
efficacy (Fig. 3B and C). It is also noteworthy that the
doses of cisplatin we tested in our ex vivo analysis are
clinically relevant, since they are in the range achievable
by intraperitoneal cisplatin administration [23, 24].
Intraperitoneal administration has been shown to increase
patient survival compared with intravenous administration,
as peritoneal cavity is the main site of disease in ovarian
cancer [24].

effects of mdivi-1, including inhibition of cell proliferation
(Fig. 4C) and mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 4D). We
further evaluated the combination effect of cisplatin
with a series of mdivi-1 analogs that have been reported
to have differential potency in inhibiting Drp1 (Fig. 4E
and F). Compound B was reported to have full efficacy
as mdivi-1 (compound A) in inhibiting Drp1 [13], but
our caspase-3/7 activity assay showed that compound B
only had limited effect when combined with cisplatin in
enhancing apoptosis, indicating that while the i-Propyl
group does not affect the efficacy on Drp1 inhibition, this
group diminishes the potential for the synergism with
cisplatin. Compounds C and D were described both as

To investigate whether the synergistic effect of
the combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1 is dependent
on the inhibition of Drp1 by mdivi-1, we evaluated
the combination effect on Drp1 wild-type (WT) and
knockout (KO) SV40-transformed MEF cells (Fig.
4A). Surprisingly, after treatment with the combination,
both Drp1 WT and KO cells showed similar increase in
apoptosis (Fig. 4B), indicating that the synergism is Drp1independent. We also identified other Drp1-independent

having moderate efficacy in inhibiting Drp1. However,
we found that only compound D when combined with
cisplatin had similar activity as compared to mdivi-1.
Blocking SH group with methyl in compound F abolished
the synergism with cisplatin, indicating the SH group is
necessary for both inhibiting Drp1 and the synergism with
cisplatin. Thus, the structure activity relationship (SAR)
of mdivi-1 and analogs with respect to the synergism with
cisplatin is not consistent with the SAR for inhibiting
Drp1. Taken together, these data indicate that midiv-1
enhances cisplatin efficacy through Drp1-independent
mechanisms.

We then sought to understand the mechanism
underlying the synergistic effect of the combination.
Since one of the crucial mechanisms of cisplatininduced cell death is through replication stress-related
DNA damage, we examined the DNA damage response
following combination treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells.
Chk1, Chk2, and ATM were phosphorylated in response

to cisplatin alone (Fig. 5A). However, the combination
with mdivi-1 preferentially induced dose-dependent
increased phosphorylation of Chk1 (Fig. 5A), suggesting
that the enhanced replication stress is an early event upon
combination treatment. Notably, mdivi-1 alone at 50 μM
also induced activation of Chk1 that is similar to the effect
of 20 μM cisplatin alone. This indicates that mdivi-1
alone interferes with replication, and its combination with
cisplatin triggers a synergistic induction of replication
stress. We then analyzed the effect of the combination on
cell cycle. After 20 h treatment, cisplatin alone abolished
the uptake of BrdU (Fig. 5B). But rather than a G2
arrest as reported previously [25], the majority of cells
accumulated in the next round of G1 phase. In contrast,
the combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1 resulted in an
increase of G2 phase cells (30.75% compared to 18.97%
in cells treated with cisplatin alone). Despite a slight
decrease in the number of S phase cells following mdivi-1
treatment (44.23% compared to 50.84% in DMSO-treated
cells) (Fig. 5C), the amount of BrdU that was incorporated
into DNA (BrdU intensity) was substantially decreased
(Fig. 5D), further indicating that mdivi-1 has direct and
profound impact on DNA replication. Thus, the enhanced
replication stress by the combination during S phase

caused a more efficient G2 arrest. DNA strand breaks are
also enhanced, as shown by the high level of γ-H2AX in
the combination-treated cells (Fig. 5E).

The combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1
preferentially upregulates Noxa, and through
promoting mitochondrial dysfunction and
swelling enhances MOMP and mitochondrial
apoptotic signaling in a Bax/Bak-independent
manner
Activation of mitochondria-initiated intrinsic
apoptotic signaling by cisplatin-induced DNA damage
is another critical mechanism of cisplatin action [2].
We thus focused on the role of mitochondrial pathway
in the combination-induced apoptosis. Caspase-9 was
cleaved only upon the combination treatment (Fig. 6A).
There was also a time-dependent release of cytochrome
c from mitochondria (Fig. 6B), indicating the occurrence
of MOMP. We then analyzed the expression of several
anti-apoptotic as well as pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins. We found that the pro-apoptotic BH3-only
protein Noxa was specifically and highly induced upon

combination treatment (Fig. 6C), which was accompanied
with the cleavage of its binding partner Mcl-1 (Fig. 6C).
Cycloheximide treatment revealed that the increased
level of Noxa is not due to post-translational regulation
(Fig. 6D). Knockdown of Noxa reduced the release of
cytochrome c and the cleavage of caspase-9 and -3 (Fig.
6E). However, the relative high knockdown efficiency of
Noxa, in conjunction with the relative small reduction in
cytochrome c release and caspase cleavage, suggested the
activation of additional pathways that trigger MOMP.
Since Noxa promotes MOMP through Bax or Bakmediated mechanisms [26], we next investigated the role
of Bax and Bak in the induction of MOMP following
the combination treatment. It is interesting to note that
mdivi-1 has been shown to prevent MOMP through a Bax/

Bak-dependent pathway by inhibiting Drp1 [13]. Loss of
both Bax and Bak was known to render cells completely
resistant to cisplatin-induced apoptosis [18]. In order to
understand the role of Bax and Bak in the activation of
MOMP induced by the combination, we employed Bax/
Bak double knockout (DKO) SV40-transformed MEF
cells. In agreement with the previous report [18], loss of
both Bax and Bak rendered MEF cells resistant to cisplatin
(Fig. 7A), as evidenced by the absence of cleavage of
caspase-9 and -3 following 20 h treatment of cisplatin
alone in Bax/Bak DKO cells. However unexpectedly, the
combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1 induced the cleavage
of caspase-9 and -3 in both Bax/Bak WT and DKO cells
within 8 h (Fig. 7B and C). Furthermore, similar number
of Annexin V-positive apoptotic cells (Fig. 7D) and the

release of cytochrome c (Fig. 7E) were observed in both
Bax/Bak WT and DKO cells following the combination
treatment. These results indicated that the combination
enhances MOMP bypassing Bax/Bak-dependent
mechanisms.
In order to understand the nature of the Bax/Bakindependent MOMP triggered by the combination, we
performed a detailed analysis of mitochondrial function.

No changes in intracellular ATP levels were observed
in both combination and drug alone treated cells (Fig.
8A). Mdivi-1 alone suppressed mitochondrial respiration
(Fig. 8B), which is consistent with the result shown
in Fig. 4D. Following combination treatment, oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) was decreased, but maintained
at higher level than in mdivi-1 treated cells (Fig. 8B).
Also intriguingly, the combination-treated cells did not

respond to oligomycin, indicating significant proton leak
and mitochondrial uncoupling (Fig. 8B). Both mdivi-1
and the combination treatment enhanced the extracellular
acidification rate (ECAR) (Fig. 8C), further indicating
mitochondrial dysfunction that caused the shift of cellular
energy production from mitochondria to glycolysis. We
observed a large increase in mitochondrial membrane
potential only upon combination treatment (Fig. 8D),
which can be prevented by an uncoupler FCCP (Fig. 8E).
We also observed an enhanced production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) after combination treatment
(Fig. 8F and G). Furthermore, fluorescence (Fig. 8H)
and electron microscopy (Fig. 8I) revealed that the
combination treatment led to increased mitochondrial
size and loss of mitochondrial matrix density, indicating
pronounced mitochondrial swelling, regardless of the
status of Bax and Bak. These observations suggest that
mitochondrial swelling and subsequent physical rupture
of mitochondrial outer membrane contribute to the
induction of Bax/Bak-independent MOMP in response to
the combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1. Since Bax/Bakdependent MOMP is required for the action of cisplatin
alone, the ability of the combination of cisplatin and
mdivi-1 in inducing MOMP in a Bax/Bak-independent
manner appears to be crucial in overcoming cisplatin
resistance.

clinical challenge. In this study, we have discovered that
mdivi-1, a thioquinazolinone compound, when combined
with cisplatin is able to efficiently overcome platinum
drug resistance. We also revealed novel mode of action
of mdivi-1, which manifested as inhibition of DNA
replication and mitochondrial respiration. The combined
effect of cisplatin and mdivi-1 leads to enhanced
DNA damage, upregulation of Noxa and simultaneous
mitochondrial dysfunction, which result in the induction
of Bax- and Bak-independent MOMP, proceeding strong
activation of mitochondrial apoptotic cascade (Fig.
9). Thus, mdivi-1 and its derivative thioquinazolinone
compounds represent a novel class of agents for platinum
drug based combination therapies.
Mdivi-1 inhibits DNA replication leading to
replication stress. The combination of cisplatin and
mdivi-1 thus synergistically provokes robust replication
stress-mediated signaling events, which include a more
efficient G2 cell cycle arrest. G2 arrest has been shown
required for engaging cell death and is thus related with
cisplatin sensitivity [27, 28]. Further studies are warranted
to understand the mechanism of mdivi-1 alone and its
combination with cisplatin on DNA replication.
Cisplatin-DNA lesions activate DNA damage
response, which eventually leads to permeabilization
of the outer mitochondrial membrane via activation of
the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members including Bax
and Bak [18]. Abrogation of mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway is related with acquired multidrug resistance
[29]. Noxa, a member of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only
Bcl-2 protein family, can be induced by cisplatin [30],
and promotes MOMP through Bax or Bak-mediated
mechanisms [26]. The level of Noxa has been shown to
be a central determinant of hypersensitivity to cisplatin

DISCUSSION
Despite the extensive efforts that have been made
to understand the complex mechanism underlying
cellular resistance to platinum-based anticancer drugs,
to date, overcoming this type of drug resistance by
pharmacological manipulation still represents a major

Figure 9: Proposed model on the mechanism underlying strong induction of apoptosis by the combination of cisplatin and
mdivi-1. Cisplatin alone induces DNA damage resulting in Bax/Bak-dependent apoptosis. The combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1 is

able to enhance DNA damage, upregulate Noxa expression and trigger mitochondrial swelling, which together causes co-initiation of Bax/
Bak-dependent and -independent mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), overcoming potential block in mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway occurred in cisplatin resistant cells, thus triggering strong apoptosis.

in testicular germ cell tumors [31]. In addition, induction
of Noxa is able to enhance the sensitivity of ovarian
cancer cells to cisplatin [32]. Our results showed that
the selective induction of Noxa is a key event for the
enhanced activation of mitochondrial apoptotic signaling
by the combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1. The
induction of Noxa by the combination seemed to be a
result of increased DNA damage response through a p53independent mechanism, since H1299 cells are p53-null.
Though mdivi-1 has been shown to block tBid-activated
and Bax/Bak-mediated MOMP by inhibiting Drp1 [13],
the selective induction of Noxa is able to bypass the
inhibitory effect of mdivi-1 on Drp1-related MOMP, and
thus contribute to the enhancement of MOMP induced by
the combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1.
While Noxa plays important roles in the induction of
MOMP, Noxa-mediated pathway is not a sole determinant
for the combination-induced apoptosis, indicating the
combination of cisplatin and mdivi-1 overcomes cisplatin
resistance through targeting multiple mechanisms.
We found that mdivi-1 is able to inhibit mitochondrial
respiration and enhance extracellular acidification.
Cisplatin is also known to inhibit the enzymatic
activities of mitochondrial electron transport chain and
cause depletion of mitochondrial reduced equivalents
[33]. When cisplatin and mdivi-1 are combined, we
observed a hyperpolarization of mitochondria, which
was accompanied with mitochondrial uncoupling and
generation of ROS. During apoptosis the closure of
voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) was proposed
to be related with the mitochondrial hyperpolarization,
which is then followed by osmotic imbalance, physical
rupture of mitochondrial outer membrane and consequent
release of intermembrane space (IMS) proteins [34].
Consistent with this model, we observed extensive
mitochondrial swelling and subsequent cytochrome
c release independent of Bax and Bak following
combination treatment.
In platinum resistant tumors, both cisplatin and
mdivi-1 provoke apoptotic signaling to the extent that
by each compound alone is not able to achieve efficient
cell killing. In combination, however, they act in a
complementary manner on the induction of MOMP
by simultaneous targeting two crucial mechanisms of
cisplatin action through inhibiting both DNA replication
and mitochondrial function to amplify apoptotic signaling,
thus producing synthetic lethal effects. This mechanism
is able to bypass Bax- and Bak-mediated pathway, whose
deficiencies are often seen in platinum resistant tumors.
The “dual-targeting” mechanism of our combination
strategy thus confers superior pro-apoptotic activity than
conventional chemosensitizers that target mostly one
single mechanism, such as blocking DNA repair enzymes
to enhance DNA damage.
Our results elucidated pharmacologic effect of our
combination strategy, thus providing a firm molecular
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

basis for the use of mdivi-1 and its analog compounds
as valuable therapeutic adjuvants. Given the organ safety
and protective effect of mdivi-1 already known in small
animals [35], our present work should expedite the
repurposing, exploration, and development of mdivi-1 and
its derivatives for combination therapies with platinum
drugs in the treatment of drug resistant tumors.

UK). Other reagents, unless specified, were from SigmaAldrich.

Total cellular ATP content was determined using a
luminescent ATP detection kit, ATPlite (PerkinElmer Life
Sciences, Boston, MA), according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. The luminescence intensity was measured
using a microplate reader, Synergy 2 (BioTek instruments,
Winooski, VT).

Cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay
Cell proliferation was determined using a
CyQUANT Direct Cell Proliferation Assay kit
(Invitrogen), the activity of caspase-3/7 was measured
using a Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay Systems (Promega,
Madison, WI), and the MTS colorimetric survival assay
was performed using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One

control cells at 100%. The data were plotted and curve
fitted using GraphPad Prism software. The cytotoxic
interactions between the two drugs was determined using
the method of Chou and Talalay [20]. The combination
index (CI) was determined using a computer program
CompuSyn. A CI < 1 indicates synergy, CI > 1 indicates
antagonism, and CI = 1 indicates additivity. To quantify
the number of cells with active caspase-3, cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron microscopy
sciences, Hatfield, PA), stained with Alexa Fluor-488
conjugated antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175)
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) followed by
flow cytometry. An FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection
Kit (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was used to
quantify apoptotic cells, according to the manufacturer’s

Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular
acidification rate (ECAR) were measured using a Seahorse
XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience,
North Billerica, MA), as previously described [37]. Cells
were seeded in XF24 cell culture plates at 4×104 cells/well
and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37°C. Prior to the analysis,
cells were washed and growth medium was replaced with
bicarbonate-free medium. Cells were then incubated for
another 60 min in a 37°C incubator without CO2, followed
by simultaneous OCR and ECAR measurements.

To measure mitochondrial membrane potential and
intracellular generation of ROS, cells were incubated
with 50 nM of TMRM (Invitrogen) and 10 µM DCFDA (Sigma) for 20 min at 37°C after drug exposure. To
measure mitochondrial generated ROS, cells were preincubated with 5 µM of MitoSox (Invitrogen) for 30
min at 37°C then followed by drug exposure. After wash
with PBS, cells were trypsinized and suspended in HBSS
containing 1% BSA. The fluorescence intensity of TMRM,
DCF, and MitoSox were analyzed using a CyAn ADP
Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) or an Accuri C6
flow cytometer (BD Accuri Cytometers, Ann Arbor, MI).

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were treated with 20 μM cisplatin, 20 μM
mdivi-1, or the combination of 20 μM cisplatin and 20
μM mdivi-1 for 20 h. S phase cells were then pulselabeled with 10 μM BrdU for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were
trypsinized, fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and incubated
overnight at 4°C. DNA was denatured in 2 N HCl
containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and neutralized with 0.1
M Na2B4O7. Cells were then stained with FITC-labeled
anti-BrdU antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). To
determine the number of cells in mitosis, cells were then
stained with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated phospho-Histone
H3 (Ser 10) antibody (Cell signaling technology). To
measure DNA content, cells were incubated in PI solution
(PBS containing 50 µg/ml of PI and 40 µg/ml of RNase A)
