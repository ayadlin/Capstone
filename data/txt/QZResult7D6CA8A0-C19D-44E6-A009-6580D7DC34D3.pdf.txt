Abstract
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) may serve as a useful target for drug
development in non-diabetic diseases. However, some colorectal cancer cells are resistant to
PPARγ agonists by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Here we provide the first evidence
that elevated PPARδ expression and/or activation of PPARδ antagonize the ability of PPARγ to
induce colorectal carcinoma cell death. More importantly, the opposing effects of PPARδ and
PPARγ in regulating programmed cell death are mediated by survivin and caspase-3. We found
that activation of PPARγ results in decreased survivin expression and increased caspase-3 activity,
whereas activation of PPARδ counteracts these effects. Our findings suggest that PPARδ and
PPARγ coordinately regulate cancer cell fate by controlling the balance between the cell death and
survival and demonstrate that inhibition of PPARδ can reprogram PPARγ ligand-resistant cells to
respond to PPARγ agonists.

Introduction
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear
hormone receptor superfamily and are also ligand-dependent transcription factors. To date,
three mammalian PPARs have been identified and are referred to as PPARα (NR1C1),
PPARδ/β (NR1C2) and PPARγ (NR1C3), respectively. It is well established that modulation
of PPAR activity maintains cellular and whole-body glucose and lipid homeostasis. Hence,

great efforts have been made to develop drugs targeting these receptors. For example,
PPARγ synthetic agonists, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are anti-diabetic agents which
suppress insulin resistance in adipose tissue, while a PPARδ agonist are currently being
evaluated for treatment of dyslipidemias, obesity, and/or Type-2 diabetes. Recent studies
suggest that PPARγ and PPARδ may play an important role in modulating colorectal
carcinogenesis as well as other types of cancer (Cellai et al., 2006; Gupta et al., 2004;
Panigrahy et al., 2005; Takayama et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2004; Yin et al., 2005).

Cellular transformation and tumor progression involve cooperative interactions between
signaling pathways that affect both tumor cell proliferation and death. Dysregulation of
apoptosis with increased resistance to cell death is a common feature of malignant cells and
represents a significant obstacle to successful cancer therapy. A growing body of evidence
has shown that PPARγ agonists exhibit antitumor and apoptosis-inducing effects in a broad
range of human malignancies. In cell culture studies, activation of PPARγ results in tumor
cell growth arrest through induction of apoptosis and/or differentiation in many cell types,
including colorectal carcinoma cells. In animal models, activation of PPARγ inhibits
colorectal tumor growth in xenograft studies and in azoxymethane (AOM)-treated mice
(Osawa et al., 2003; Sarraf et al., 1998). However, PPARγ agonists have been reported to
have tumor-promoting effects in the ApcMin/+ mice (Lefebvre et al., 1998; Pino et al., 2004;
Saez et al., 1998). These divergent effects of PPARγ might be related to drug doses and
bioavailability and/or animal models employed. These paradoxic observations appear to
have been resolved by genetic studies showing that the heterozygous disruption of PPARγ is
sufficient to increase tumor number(s) in AOM-treated mice and that ligand-activation of
PPARγ inhibits tumor growth only in the presence of functional APC but not in cells with
loss of APC function (Girnun et al., 2002). The ApcMin/+ mouse contains an inherited
mutation in one allele of Apc gene and eventually develop intestinal adenomas (Williams et
al., 1996). These results suggest that loss of APC may alter the normal response of intestinal
epithelial tumor cells to PPARγ agonists. This is consistent with the negative outcome of
clinical trials examining the efficacy of PPARγ agonists in humans with advanced colorectal
cancer (CRC) (Burstein et al., 2003; Kulke et al., 2002) since an APC mutation occurs in
about 85% of human CRCs. Loss of APC function results in upregulation of PPARδ through
β-catenin/Tcf cascade (He et al., 1999). Therefore, one potential mechanism by which
colorectal carcinoma cells become resistant to PPARγ agonists could include antagonism by
PPARδ.
The role of PPARδ in cancer biology remains unclear since results generated by different
groups do not agree. One study showed that deletion of PPARδ exon 8 enhances polyp
growth in ApcMin/+ and AOM-treated mice (Harman et al., 2004). On the other hand, the
studies from our group and others revealed that loss of PPARδ by deletion of its exons 4-5
or 4 attenuated both small and large intestinal adenoma growth in ApcMin/+ mice and AOMtreated mice (Wang et al., 2006b; Zuo et al., 2009). Moreover, our results revealed that
activation of PPARδ accelerates intestinal tumor growth by promoting cell survival in vitro
and in vivo (Gupta et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004). These studies indicate that PPARγ and
PPARδ have opposing effects on CRC progression. Hence it is critical to evaluate the

relationship between PPARγ and PPARδ in CRC in order to develop strategies for cancer
prevention and treatment and further establish their respective roles in cancer biology.

Survivin is a unique member of the IAP family since it is overexpressed in almost every
human tumor that has been studied, but is barely detectable in most normal adult tissues
(Altieri, 2003). Overexpression of survivin is associated with poor clinical outcome with
reduced tumor cell apoptosis in patients with CRC (Kawasaki et al., 1998; Sarela et al.,
2001). Moreover, high expression of survivin correlates with resistance to certain anticancer
agents and radiation therapy (Asanuma et al., 2000; Zaffaroni and Daidone, 2002). In
contrast, inhibition of survivin expression or interference with survivin function inhibits
tumor cell growth, induces apoptosis, and sensitizes tumor cells to radiation or
chemotherapy (Kuo et al., 2004; Olie et al., 2000).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that PPARδ causes colorectal carcinoma cells
to become resistant to PPARγ–mediated apoptosis and to explore how PPARδ and PPARγ
regulate tumor cell death. Here we report that overexpression of PPARδ or activation of
PPARδ by its agonists attenuates the ability of PPARγ agonists to induce apoptosis. One
intriguing finding is that treatment with a PPARγ agonist reduces survivin expression, which
in turn induces apoptosis via increased caspase-3 activity. In contrast, treatment of PPARδ
ligands protects cancer cells from PPARγ-induced apoptosis by inhibiting induction of the
survivin-caspase-3 apoptotic pathway. Consistent with these findings, we also observed that
PPARδ expression correlates well with survivin levels in human CRC specimens.
Collectively, our results identify PPARδ as an anti-apoptotic gene that contributes to the
resistance of CRC cells to the PPARγ agonist-induced apoptosis.

PPARδ contributes to resistance of PPARγ ligand-induced apoptosis

To investigate whether PPARδ confers resistance to cell death induced by PPARγ, we first
measured the relative levels of PPARγ and PPARδ in a panel of eight colorectal carcinoma
cell lines. As shown in Figure 1a, all cell lines expressed fairly equivalent levels of PPARγ
protein. In contrast, HCT-116 cells exhibited higher PPARδ expression than the other lines
tested (Figure 1a). Since LS-174T and HCT-116 cells have been carefully evaluated to
understand the anti-apoptotic effects of PPARδ (Gupta et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2004), we
examined the ability of PPARγ agonists to induce apoptosis in these two cell lines by
annexin V-FITC assay. Treatment of LS-174T cells with a selective synthetic PPARγ
agonist GW7845 at 5 μM for 1, 2, and 3 days. The peak of apoptotic rate induced by
GW7845 was observed in 2-day's treatment (Figure 1b, left panel). The treatment of
GW7845 at 5 or 10 μM for 2 days resulted in a significant apoptosis (42% to 56%)
compared to controls (DMSO) (Figure 1b, right panel). The pro-apoptotic effect of GW7845
in LS-174T cells was also confirmed by DNA fragment assays (Figure 1c). Furthermore, our
results showed that blocking of PPARγ activation by treatment with its antagonist
(GW9662) inhibited GW7845-induced apoptosis in LS-174T cells (Figure 1d), suggesting
that PPARγ mediates the effect of GW7845 on induction of apoptosis. In contrast, HCT-116
cells with high PPARδ expression are more resistant to the PPARγ agonist GW7845 than
LS-174T cells (Figure 1b and 1e). Similar results for the specificity of GW7845 in the

HCT-116 cells were observed as well (data not shown). In addition, the results from cell
viability assays with treatment of GW7845 at 10 μM revealed that viable LS-174T cells
significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner, whereas the viable HCT-116 cells only
reduced in day 3 but increased in day 5 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The clonogenic cell
survival assays further showed that all LS-174T cells were killed after 5-day's treatment,
whereas HCT-116 cells formed colonies after 9-day's treatment (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
These results demonstrate that HCT-116 cells are more resistant to the PPARγ agonist
GW7845 than LS-174T cells. Since both cell lines express similar levels of the PPARγ
receptor but have different amounts of PPARδ, these results suggest that PPARδ may be
involved in protecting cancer cells from PPARγ-induced apoptosis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To directly study the function of PPARδ in PPARγ-induced apoptosis, we determined
whether overexpression or deletion of PPARδ in cancer cells affects the ability of PPARγ
agonist (GW7845) to induce apoptosis. Overexpression of PPARδ in LS-174T cells
significantly reduces GW7845-induced apoptosis, as compared to control cells (Figure 2a,
left panel). The level of PPARδ expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Figure
2a, right panel). In contrast, genetic disruption of both PPARδ alleles in HCT-116 cells
(PPARδ-/-) by targeted homologous recombination restored the ability of PPARγ to induce
apoptosis (Figure 2b). The HCT-116/PPARδ-/- cells don't express both PPARδ mRNA and
protein (Figure 2b, right panel). These results demonstrate that PPARδ is responsible for
colorectal carcinoma cells resistance to PPARγ ligand-induced apoptosis.
Activation of PPARδ inhibits PPARγ ligand-induced apoptosis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Amplification of PPARδ expression or deletion of PPARδ gene could have multiple
biological effects independent of endogenous PPARδ activity. To overcome these
limitations, we assessed whether PPARδ agonists inhibit the pro-apoptotic activity of
PPARγ via the endogenous PPARδ receptor. LS-174T cells were treated with a selective
PPARδ agonist GW501516 and/or PPARγ agonist GW7845. GW501516 attenuated
GW7845-induced apoptosis to basal levels (DMSO) (Figure 3a). Similarly, an endogenous
PPARγ ligand 15-PGJ2 induced apoptosis at a much lower concentration in LS-174T cells,
while a PPARδ ligand cPGI2 inhibited 15-PGJ2-induced apoptosis (Figure 3b). To further
confirm the specificity of PPARδ agonists, we examined the anti-apoptotic effects of PPARδ
agonists in parental and PPARδ-deficient HCT-116 cells. Treatment of parental HCT-116
cells with GW501516 or cPGI2 significantly suppressed PPARγ-induced apoptosis in a
dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the anti-apoptotic effect of PPARδ agonists was not
seen in PPARδ-deficient HCT-116 cells, demonstrating that the effects of these PPARδ
ligands are due to specific activation of PPARδ (Figure 3c-d). These results demonstrate that
ligand-activated PPARδ inhibits PPARγ-induced apoptosis.
Survivin is a down-stream target of PPARγ
To further investigate PPARγ/δ-regulated intracellular events in apoptotic cascades, we first
examined whether activation of PPARγ modulates genes involved in regulating cell
apoptosis in CRC, such as Bcl-2, PTEN, and survivin. Treatment with the PPARγ agonist
GW7845 decreased survivin expression but did not affect Bcl-2 and PTEN levels in
LS-174T cells (Figure 4a). In addition, treatment of GW7845 did not affect the levels of

phosphorylation of histone H3 (p-H3), indicating that PPARγ reduction of survivin is not
due to a lack of G2 or/and M phase cells in GW7845-treated population. The PPARγ
mediated downregulation of survivin was also seen in HCT-116 cells at a higher dose
(Figure 4b). However, GW7845 failed to affect survivin expression at the mRNA level
(Figure 4c), suggesting that PPARγ downregulates survivin protein expression via a posttranslational modification mechanism. Since degradation of survivin protein is controlled by
ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent destruction in the cells, we examined whether
treatment of LS-174T cells with a proteasome inhibitor (MG-132) blocks GW7845-induced
downregulation of survivin. MG-132 inhibits the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated
proteins in cells. Indeed, treatment of MG-132 restored the survivin expression from 24 h to
48 h, suggesting that PPARγ downregulates survivin protein expression via enhancing its
protein degradation (Figure 4d). Furthermore, forced-expression of survivin completely
inhibits GW7845-induced apoptosis in LS-174T cells (Figure 4e). These results demonstrate
that PPARγ induces cell death through downregulation of survivin.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, we investigated whether ligand-activated PPARδ attenuates the effect of PPARγ on
downregulation of survivin. As shown in Figure 4f, treatment of PPARδ agonist GW501516
partially overcomes the effect of PPARγ ligand on survivin expression in both dose- and
time-dependent manner. These results indicate that survivin is a downstream target for both
PPARγ and PPARδ in regulating cell survival and death.
Caspase-3 mediates the effects of PPARγ and PPARδ in modulating apoptosis
We further examined whether PPARγ/δ affects caspase activity. Our results showed that a
general caspase inhibitor (zVAD-fmk) reduced PPARγ agonist-induced apoptosis,
suggesting that caspases are also downstream targets of PPARγ (Figure 5a). Furthermore,
the PPARγ agonist GW7845 increased caspase-3 activity in both a dose- and timedependent manner (Figure 5b). The activation of caspase-3 in turn resulted in cleavage of its
target gene PARP in LS-174T cells (Figure 5b). Consistent with above results, PPARδ
agonists (GW501516 and cPGI2) inhibited PPARγ-enhanced caspase-3 activity in LS-174T
cells (Figure 5d-f). The ability of cPGI2 to inhibit 15-PGJ2-induced caspase-3 activity was
observed in parental HCT116 cells, but not in PPARδ-deficient cells (Figure 5f),
demonstrating that PPARδ mediates this effect of cPGI2. Taken together, these results
support our hypothesis that activation of PPARδ inhibits the pro-apoptotic effects of PPARγ.

Survivin expression correlates with PPARδ expression in human colorectal cancer
To determine the clinical relevance of our in vitro results, we examined whether survivin
expression correlates with PPARδ in human colorectal carcinoma tissues. The analysis of
Real-Time quantitative PCR revealed that the levels of survivin mRNA in all human colon
carcinomas at grade II-III are elevated as compared to the matched normal tissues (Figure
6a). Similarly, PPARδ mRNA is also elevated in 8 of 12 (67%) cancer specimens (Figure
6b). The spearman rank coefficient was utilized to test if the correlation was significant in
all 12-paired samples. A positive correlation of survivin and PPARδ is found in these
samples (r=0.538, p=0.0066). Consistent with the above results, the positive correlation of
survivin and PPARδ is also observed in eight CRC cell lines at both mRNA (Figure 6c, left
panal) and protein levels (Figure 6c, right panal). Furthermore, our preliminary studies

showed that ApcMin/+ mice treated with a PPARδ agonist (GW501516) exhibited higher
survivin mRNA expression levels in the small intestine than control mice (Data not shown).
These observations indicate that the anti-apoptotic effect of PPARδ correlate well with
survivin expression in vivo.

Discussion
The conflicting results regarding the effect of PPARδ on intestinal tumorigenesis in
ApcMin/+ and AOM-treated mice may be related to differences in the specific targeting
strategy employed to delete PPARδ. Deletion of PPARδ exon 4 and/or 5, which encode an
essential portion of the DNA binding domain, is thought to disrupt PPARδ function as a
nuclear transcriptional factor and to inhibit tumorigenesis. The deletion of exon 8, the last
PPARδ exon, is postulated to generate a hypomorphic allele, which retains some
aporeceptor function. Indeed, the observation that the high rates of embryonic mortality,
subsequent to abnormal trophoblastic giant cell differentiation and abnormal placental
development occurred in deletion of PPARδ exon 4-5, but not in deletion of PPARδ exon 8
mice supports this hypothesis (Nadra et al., 2006; Peters et al., 2000).

In a mouse mammary tumor model, treatment with the PPARδ agonist GW501516
accelerated tumor formation, while a PPARγ agonist GW7845 delayed tumor growth (Yin et
al., 2005). This observation suggests that there are distinct mechanistic differences between
PPARγ and PPARδ in regulating tumor progression. Since the beneficial effect of PPARγ
agonists in clinical trials for patients with CRC and in ApcMin/+ mice has not been observed,
a potential explanation for these observations could be related to PPARδ. Here we present
evidence demonstrating that overexpression of PPARδ or activation of endogenous PPARδ
counteracts the pro-apoptotic effect of PPARγ ligands, while disruption of PPARδ restores
the ability of PPARγ to induce apoptosis in colorectal carcinoma cells (Figure 2-3). These
results may explain the discrepancies of PPARγ anti-tumor effects in different intestinal
tumor animal models and confirm that PPARγ may actually serve as a tumor suppressor.
Furthermore, our data also provides important evidence that could enable the design of
novel strategies for CRC prevention and/or treatment. For example, combinational treatment
of PPARγ agonists with PPARδ antagonists will overcome resistance to cell death and
restore the sensitivity to PPARγ agonists. Understanding the mechanism(s) by which
colorectal carcinoma cells are resistant to PPARγ agonist is of great interest and potential
clinical value.
Although it has been established that activation of PPARγ induces tumor cell apoptosis, the
downstream mediators of these effects are not well defined. Recent emerging data indicates
that PPARγ agonists can modulate the expression of several apoptotic activators and
suppressors, such as PTEN, Bcl-2, and NF-κB. For example, PPARγ agonists induce PTEN
expression in pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and breast cancer cells
(Farrow and Evers, 2003; Han and Roman, 2006; Teresi et al., 2006), while these agonists
inhibit Bcl-2 expression in neuroblastoma and lung cancer cells (Kim et al., 2003; Li et al.,
2005) and NF-κB expression in thyroid cancer (Kato et al., 2006). Microarray studies with
colorectal carcinoma cells have led to the identification of a number of PPARγ target genes
that could serve in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and adhesion (Gupta et al.,

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 August 02.

2001). However, the function of these genes in regulating colorectal tumor cell apoptosis has
not been fully investigated. Here, we present data showing that PPARγ agonists at a relative
low dose do not significantly affect PTEN and Bcl-2 expression in CRC cells (Figure 4a),
although a high dose of PPARγ agonists do inhibit Bcl-2 expression (data not shown).
Survivin is one of eight members of the IAP family, including the most studied XIAP, cIAP1, c-IAP2, and survivin. The IAP gene family encodes proteins which inhibit cellular
apoptosis by binding to caspases and inhibiting their activity (Salvesen and Duckett, 2002).
Survivin expression is elevated in almost every human tumor that has been studied and is
associated with poor clinical outcome with reduced tumor cell apoptosis in patients with
CRC, but is barely detectable in most normal adult tissues (Altieri, 2003; Kawasaki et al.,
1998; Sarela et al., 2001). Although increased survivin expression is an important event in
tumorigenesis, the mechanisms responsible for survivin regulation are not fully understood.
Specifically, it is not clear which chemotherapeutic agents might target survivin. We show
here for the first time that survivin is a downstream target of PPARγ agonists (Figure 4) and
it mediates PPARγ-induced apoptosis (Figure 5A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The dysregulation of survivin in cancer cells depends on its gene transcription and posttranslational modification that affect its stability, such as phosphorylation. For example,
survivin transcription is repressed by wild-type p53 (Hoffman et al., 2002) and likely
upregulated by Wnt-β-catenin signaling (Zhang et al., 2001). However, activation of PPARγ
did not affect survivin mRNA levels (Figure 4c), suggesting that these effects occur posttranslationally. During cell cycle progression, rapid degradation of survivin protein is
controlled by ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent destruction in interphase cells (Zhao
et al., 2000), while phosphorylation of survivin on Thr34 by CDC2–cyclin-B1 has been
associated with increased protein stability at metaphase (O'Connor et al., 2002). Our data
reveals that inhibition of protease activity PPARγ reduces survivin phosphorylation at Thr34
and its expression in CRC cells (Figure 4d), indicating that activation of PPARγ may affect
survivin degradation. Understanding the precise mechanism by which PPARγ affects the
phosphorylation state of survivin will be addressed in future studies.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A more complete understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which
activation of PPARδ protects against apoptosis induced by PPARγ is of critical importance.
PPARδ has been shown to promote cell survival in the kidney following hypertonic stress
(Hao et al., 2002) and the skin following wound injury (Di-Poi et al., 2003; Di-Poi et al.,
2002). Our previous studies also showed that activation of PPARδ protects against colorectal
carcinoma cell apoptosis induced by serum deprivation (Gupta et al., 2004). In this study,
our results present the first evidence showing that ligand-activated PPARδ attenuates the
pro-apoptotic effect of PPARγ (Figure 3). More importantly, we reveal that activation of
PPARδ partially reverses the effect of PPARγ on survivin phosphorylation and expression
(Figure 4f). Furthermore, PPARδ agonists inhibit PPARγ-enhanced caspase-3 activity
(Figure 5c-d), which is dependent on the presence of the PPARδ receptor (Figure 5e). In
addition, there is a positive correlation between PPARδ and survivin expression in human
colorectal tumor tissues and cell lines (Figure 6). Thus, the precise mechanism(s) by which
PPARδ inhibits the pro-tumor effect of PPARγ requires further investigation.

In summary, data obtained from this study supports a concept that differential activation of
PPARγ or PPARδ tilts the balance between cell death and cell survival. PPARδ confers
resistance to PPARγ-induced apoptosis. Thus, activation of PPARδ promotes survival
advantages and supports tumor progression, while inhibition of PPARδ would overcome
resistance and restore sensitivity to agents that stimulate cell death.

Phoenix eco cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were transfected with 20 μg of MIEG3 vector,
survivin, pBMN-IRES-EGFP vector, or PPARδ plasmid by FuGENE 6 according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, IN). Virus-containing
medium was collected 48-72 h later and passed through a 45-μm filter. LS-174T cells were
infected with the retrovirus supernatant containing MIEG3 vector, human survivin
(MIEG3), pBMN-IRES-EGFP vector, or human PPARδ (pBMN-IRES-EGFP) as described

The LS-174T cells (4 × 105/each well), HCT-116 (1.3 × 105/each well) were plated in 6well plates. After culture 24 h the cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated in
0.5% fat-free FBS medium containing either vehicle or GW7845 for indicated days. The
viable cells were determined by trypan blue exclusion assays using Vi-Cell™XR (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA). The colonies were formed in 9 days and stained by crystal violet.

Caspase-3 activity
The caspase-3 activity was measured by using a Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assay kit (R&D,
Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells (2 × 106)
were treated indicated concentration of GW7845, 15-PGJ2, or/and GW501516 or cPGI2 in
0.5% fat-free medium for 1 day and then harvested. Cell lysates were subjected to Caspase-3
colorimetric assay.
