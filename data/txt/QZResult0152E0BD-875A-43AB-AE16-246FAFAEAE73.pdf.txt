Abstract
Schwannomas are tumors of the nervous system that occur
sporadically and in patients with the cancer predisposition
syndrome neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Schwannomas
and all NF2-related tumors are caused by loss of the tumor
suppressor merlin. Using our human in vitro model for
schwannoma, we analyzed extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and AKT signaling pathways, their
upstream growth factor receptors, and their role in schwannoma cell proliferation and adhesion to find new systemic
therapies for these tumors that, to date, are very difficult
to treat. We show here that human primary schwannoma
cells show an enhanced basal Raf/mitogen-activated protein/
ERK kinase/ERK1/2 pathway activity compared with healthy
Schwann cells. Due to a strong and prolonged activation of
platelet-derived growth factor receptor B (PDGFRB), which
is highly overexpressed, ERK1/2 and AKT activation was further increased in schwannoma, leading to increased proliferation. Using specific inhibitors, we discovered that ERK1/2
activation involves the integrin/focal adhesion kinase/Src/Ras
signaling cascades and PDGFRB-mediated ERK1/2 activation
is triggered through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein
kinase C/Src/c-Raf pathway. Due to the complexity of signals
leading to schwannoma cell proliferation, potential new
therapeutic agents should target several signaling pathways.
The PDGFR and c-Raf inhibitor sorafenib (BAY 43-9006; Bayer
Pharmaceuticals), currently approved for treatment of advanced renal cell cancer, inhibits both basal and PDGFRBmediated ERK1/2 and AKT activity and decreases cell
proliferation in human schwannoma cells, suggesting that
this drug constitutes a promising tool to treat schwannomas.
We conclude that our schwannoma in vitro model can be used
to screen for new therapeutic targets in general and that
sorafenib is possible candidate for future clinical trials.

Schwannomas are purely derived from Schwann cells and lack the
tumor suppressor protein merlin (1). Merlin is structurally related
to the ERM family proteins (ezrin, moesin and radixin; refs. 2, 3)
that act as linkers between the actin cytoskeleton and the cell
membrane (4). Using our in vitro model for human schwannoma,
we have previously shown that merlin loss leads to enhanced
proliferation and decreased apoptosis (5), increased cell-matrix
adhesion (due to the overexpression of integrins; ref. 6), and
decreased cell-cell adhesion (7). The RhoGTPases Rac1 and Cdc42
and their downstream effector p21-activated kinase (PAK) are
activated in human primary schwannoma cells and have been
linked to the aforementioned characteristics of schwannoma cells
(8, 9). PAK inhibits merlin in a negative feedback loop (10, 11),
and PAK inhibition leads to decreased proliferation rates and
ruffling in merlin-deficient cell lines (12). PAK can cross-talk with
the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling
pathway. The ERK1/2 signaling pathway is involved in rat
Schwann cell dedifferentiation (13), integrin-mediated cell motility, adhesion (14), and proliferation (15). ERK1/2 that is activated
in mouse and rat schwannoma cell lines (16) is inhibited by
merlin in different cell lines (17). We therefore analyzed ERK1/2
pathway in human primary schwannomas and assessed its role
in cell proliferation and adhesion to identify potential therapeutic
targets for the treatment of schwannomas. Merlin additionally
inhibits the AKT signaling pathway (18, 19), which is important
for rat Schwann cell survival (20).
Activation of ERK1/2 and AKT cascades is triggered by surface
receptors, such as integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases (21). One
candidate is platelet-derived growth factor receptor h (PDGFRh),
wherein internalization and degradation is merlin-dependent in
human schwannoma cell line HEI 193 (18). Moreover, PDGFRh
interacts directly with integrins (22), which are overexpressed in
human primary schwannoma cells (6). We thus investigated the
role of PDGFRh and other growth factor receptors acting upstream
of the ERK1/2 and AKT pathways in human primary schwannoma
cells. We show that ERK1/2 and subsequent enhanced proliferation
occur through a strong and prolonged activation of PDGFRh after
stimulation of human primary schwannoma cells with the
PDGFRh-specific agonist, platelet-derived growth factor-DD
(PDGF-DD). In addition, schwannoma cells display an enhanced
basal ERK1/2 activity compared with Schwann cells. Strong AKT
activity was also observed in schwannoma cells upon stimulation
with PDGF-DD. Using specific inhibitors, we characterized the
mechanisms of ERK1/2 and AKT activation. Basal ERK1/2
activation involves the integrin/focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Src/
Ras signaling cascade, and PDGFRh-mediated ERK1/2 activation
involves the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase C
(PKC)/Src/c-Raf pathway. Cross-talk between ERK1/2 and AKT
cascades was also observed. Based on our data, we conclude that

multiple cascades underlie schwannoma development and therefore suggest that potential therapeutic agents should target several signaling pathways. We therefore tested the PDGFR and c-Raf
inhibitor sorafenib (BAY 43-9006; Bayer Pharmaceuticals), currently
approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell cancer (RCC;
ref. 23). We here show that sorafenib inhibits both basal and
PDGFRh-mediated ERK1/2 and AKT activity and decreases
proliferation of human schwannoma cells, suggesting that this
drug could be a useful tool in the treatment of schwannomas.

Materials and Methods
Isolation and culture of human Schwann and schwannoma cells.
Human Schwann cells from healthy nerve donors and schwannoma cells
from patients with NF2 (after informed consent) were isolated, as previously
described (24, 25). Diagnosis of NF2 was established by clinical criteria (26).
Cell were harvested and resuspended in proliferation medium (GFM):
DMEM, 10% FCS, 0.5 Amol/L forskolin, 10 nmol/L h heregulin, 0.5 mmol/L
3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and 2.5 Ag/mL insulin, as described in
ref. 25.
Chemicals. GF109203X, LY294002, SU6656, U0126 (kindly supplied by
Prof. Jyrki Kukkonen, University of Helsinki), IPA-3 (kindly supplied by
Dr. Jeffrey R Peterson, Fox Chase Cancer Center), AG1296, 5-bromo-2¶deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and FTI-277 were from Calbiochem. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), GW5074, t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol
(Triton X-100), polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), insulin,
and IBMX were from Sigma. Wortmannin (kindly supplied by Prof. Jyrki
Kukkonen, University of Helsinki) was from Tocris Cookson Ltd., PDGFDD from R&D Systems. Hoechst 33352 was from Molecular Probes
(Eugene), and sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) was kindly supplied by Bayer
Pharmaceuticals (West Haven). All inhibitors were added 30 min before
PDGF-DD stimulation.
Immunoblotting. Cells were cultured in precoated 35-mm plates to
f70% confluency, serum-starved for 24 h, stimulated, and lysed (5). The
immunoblotting was performed, as described in refs. 8, 9. Membranes
were incubated with antiactive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK;
anti-pThr183-pTyr185-ERK1/2; 1:2,000; Promega), anti–phosphorylated AKT
(Ser473; 1:500; Cell Signaling), anti–phosphorylated MAPK/ERK kinase 1/2
(MEK1/2) (Ser298; 1:500; Cell Signaling), anti–phosphorylated MEK1/2
(Ser217/221; 1:500; Cell Signaling), anti–phosphorylated c-Raf (Ser338; 1:500;
Cell Signaling), anti–phosphorylated FAK (p-FAK; Y925; 1:500; Cell
Signaling), anti–p-FAK (Y861; 1:500; Stressgen), and anti–p-FAK (Y397;
1:200: Chemicon) primary antibodies, followed by incubation with
appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies
(Bio-Rad). Enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) was used for
detection. RhoGDI was used as a loading control, as it has previously been
shown not to be regulated in our system (27) in contrast to standard loading controls. Densities of bands were quantified using FluorS-Multi-Imager
(Bio-Rad). After stripping and blocking total ERK, MEK, FAK, and AKT
levels were determined using anti–total MAPK (ERK1/2, 1:500; Promega),
MEK1/2 (1:500; Cell Signaling), FAK (1:500; Upstate), and AKT (1:500; Cell
Signaling) antibodies. The expression levels of PDGFRh, epidermal growth
factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR), ErbB2, and ErbB3 were detected using antiPDGFRh (1:500) and anti-EGFR (1:500; Cell Signaling), anti-ErbB2 (NeuC18;
1:1000), and anti-ErbB3 (1:1000) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Ras pull-down. Cells were grown until f70% confluence, starved for
24 h, stimulated with 100 ng/mL of PDGF-DD for 3 min in the presence or
absence of the Ras inhibitor FTI-277 and lysed. Ras pull-down experiments
were performed using the EZ-Detect Ras activation kit (Promega) according
to manufacturer’s protocol. Western blotting was performed, as described
above, using an anti-Ras antibody (1:500; Promega).
Immunocytochemistry. Cells were serum starved for 24 h before
stimulation, and immunocytochemistry was performed, as described in
refs. 8, 9. Anti–active MAPK (anti-pThr183-pTyr185-ERK1/2; 1:2,000;
Promega) and anti–p-FAK Y397 antibodies were used for detection of active
ERK1/2 and FAK, respectively. Appropriate Cy3 or ALEXA Fluor 488–
labeled secondary antibodies were used (1:500; Sigma).

Adhesion assay. Cells were seeded onto precoated 24-well plates for
3 h (28) using different conditions: DMEM, 100 ng/mL PDGF-DD, and GFM.
Adhesion assay was performed as described (6).
BrdUrd incorporation and nuclear staining for cell growth. Cells
were cultivated on 96-well plates (Nunc) for 72 h, labeled with 10 Amol/L
BrdUrd for 24 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated with
2 mol/L HCl. Cells were blocked in 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and
incubated with anti-BrdUrd (1:100; Calbiochem) followed by ALEXA Fluor
488–labeled secondary antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes). Nuclei were
stained with 5 Ag/mL Hoechst 33342 for 30 min. Dividing cells (BrdUrd
positive) and total cell numbers (Hoechst 33342) were manually counted.
All inhibitors were added 30 min before stimulation.
Data analysis. Student’s two-tailed t test was used for pairwise
comparisons and ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, was used for
multiple comparisons. All the experiments were performed minimum in
triplicates, wherein at least three independent batches of cells from
different individuals were used. For cell counting, all cells in the well
were counted. ns means (not significant) P > 0.05, * indicates P < 0.05;
** indicates P < 0.01, and *** indicates P < 0.001. Significant values are
indicated only for the data in which the results are not self-evident. In
figures, mean F SE is given.

Results
Strong Activation of ERK1/2 in Human Primary
Schwannoma Cells
Incubation of serum-starved cells with complete medium (GFM)
for 10 minutes, 3 hours, and 24 hours produced a higher
phosphorylation/activation intensity of ERK1/2 in schwannoma
cells compared with Schwann cells (Fig. 1A). In addition to bands
at 42/44 kDa, we also observed weak but specific bands (confirmed
by library searches of the recognized epitope using Phospho.ELM
screening) at f300 kDa, which displayed the same pattern of
activity as the lower molecular weight bands. The data in Fig. 1A
represent total ERK1/2 activity in cells (combined data of 42/44 kDa
and 300 kDa bands). Maximal phosphorylation of ERK1/2
occurred in both cell types 10 minutes poststimulation and
was 3-fold higher in schwannoma cells than in Schwann cells.
Furthermore, we stimulated schwannoma cells with various
components present in GFM and observed that serum phosphorylated ERK1/2 to the levels comparable with GFM, whereas
insulin, forskolin, IBMX, and h-heregulin evoked only weak to
moderate signals even when used at high concentrations (Fig. 1B
and C). Stimulation of schwannoma cells with 100 ng/mL
PDGF-DD increased levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 by 7-fold
compared with basal, the same magnitude as serum and GFM
(Fig. 1B and C). 100 ng/mL of EGF and fibroblast growth factor
acidic (FGFa), whose functionality was tested in NIH3T3 and
PC12 cells, did not trigger ERK1/2 activation in schwannoma
cells (Fig. 1C). In line with this, schwannoma cells show no
expression of EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, Schwann
and schwannoma cells express similar levels of ErbB2 and ErbB3
receptors (Fig. 1D) and h heregulin even at high concentrations
(100 nmol/L) displayed much lower potency toward ERK1/2
activation than PDGF-DD (100 ng/mL; Fig. 1B and C).

PDGF-DD (100 ng/mL) induced strong and long-lasting MEK1/2

(p-ERK1/2) bands were also observed at 300 kDa. The 300-kDa

bands were stronger upon PDGF-DD stimulation than upon GFM
stimulation and displayed higher ERK1/2 activity in schwannoma
cells compared with Schwann cells already 10 minutes after
stimulation in contrast to 42/44 kDa bands where the significant
difference was seen only after 1 hour (Fig. 2A, compare rows 2 and 3,
top). The specificity of 300-kDa bands was estimated by Phospho.ELM screening and by using 2 Amol/L TPA. Despite strong
ERK1/2 activity at 42/44 kDa, no band at 300 kDa was observed upon
TPA stimulation, suggesting that 300 kDa bands are specific for
PDGF-DD stimulation (Fig. 2B). Thus, to show total ERK activity
in cells, Fig. 2A (bottom) shows combined data from 42/44 kDa and
300 kDa bands. Maximal MEK1/2/ERK1/2 phosphorylation occurred
10 minutes after stimulation and persisted at least up to 1 hour at
60% to 70% (MEK1/2) and 40% (ERK1/2) of maximal response and
declined to basal levels after 24 hours. In comparison, Schwann cells
displayed a weaker and only transient activity, which declined to
almost basal levels already within 1 hour after stimulation.

AKT is Strongly Activated in Schwannoma Cells upon
PDGFRB Stimulation
AKT showed strong and sustained phosphorylation/activation at
Ser473 in schwannoma cells upon stimulation with 100 ng/mL
PDGF-DD (Fig. 2C) and was observed only at its expected
molecular weight size (60 kDa).
Maximal activity was reached 10 minutes poststimulation and
remained higher than basal up to 24 hours. Schwann cells in

contrast displayed much weaker (maximal response was approximately twice lower than in schwannoma cells) and transient AKT
activity, which decreased to basal levels at already 1 hour poststimulation. Total MEK1/2, ERK1/2, and AKT expression remained
unchanged during all this conditions, and no difference between
schwannoma and Schwann cells was detected (Fig. 2A, middle and
bottom and Fig. 2C, bottom).

PDGFRB is Overexpressed in Schwannoma Cells
PDGFRh is overexpressed in schwannoma cells (f2-fold)
compared with Schwann cells (Fig. 3A). Also, schwannoma cells
display postponed and impaired PDGFRh degradation as its levels
were decreased only by f35% within 1 hour of stimulation and by
f65% after 24 hours (Fig. 3B) in contrast to Schwann cells where
the decrease was more pronounced (f85%; Fig. 3C and D). The
decrease in PDGFRh phosphorylation was slightly faster than its
degradation: it decreased by f50% ( from maximum) 1 hour after
stimulation and was abolished 24 hours poststimulation (Fig. 3B)
following the same pattern as phosphorylated MEK1/2 (p-MEK1/2)
and p-ERK1/2 activation course (see Fig. 2C, middle and bottom).

A PDGFRB-Independent Pathway Contributes to
ERK1/2 Activation in Schwannoma Cells
In addition to PDGF-DD mediated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2
activation, our data (Fig. 2A; 0 hours) also shows increased basal
levels of phosphorylated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in schwannoma cells

compared with Schwann cells. Because both MEK1/2 and ERK1/2
are equally expressed in Schwann and schwannoma cells (see
Fig. 2A), we can exclude MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 overexpression
as a reason for enhanced activity and tested the following
possibilities: (a) cross-talk of the Rac/PAK pathway with c-Raf/
MEK1/2/ERK1/2 and (b) involvement of integrins which are
overexpressed and activated in schwannoma cells (6) and have
been reported to lead to the activation of ERK1/2 via the FAK/Src/
Ras pathway (29).
The Rac/PAK pathway is not involved in the increased basal
activity of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in schwannoma cells. In
basal conditions, c-Raf was only faintly phosphorylated at PAK
phosphorylation site (Ser338; Fig. 4A, top). MEK1/2, however,
was phosphorylated at Ser298 (PAK phosphorylation site) in
both Schwann and schwannoma cells, but no difference in
the phosphorylation intensity was observed between these two
cell types (Fig. 4A, middle). Additionally, PAK inhibitor IPA-3 did
not decrease basal ERK1/2 activity. The ERK1/2 activity was

www.aacrjournals.org

instead potentiated, which possibly occurred due to cellular stress
(Fig. 4A, bottom) as has been observed previously (30). Thus, it is
unlikely that PAK contributes to the enhanced basal ERK1/2
activation.
Increased basal MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity in schwannoma cells is mediated via the integrin/FAK/src/Ras pathway.
We thus looked at the FAK/Src/Ras pathway. Increased Ras-GTP
levels, indicative for Ras activity, were detected by Ras pull-down
analyses in serum-starved schwannoma cells compared with
Schwann cells (Fig. 4B). To couple basal MEK1/2 activity to Ras
and Src, we used H-Ras inhibitor farnesyl protein transferase
inhibitor FTI-277 and selective Src family kinase inhibitor SU6656
(4 Amol/L). Both inhibitors decreased significantly basal p-MEK1/2
levels, suggesting Ras and Src to be involved in the pathway toward
basal MEK1/2 activation (Fig. 4C).
FAK is overexpressed and displays strong basal activity in
schwannoma cells. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a tyrosine
kinase that is activated after integrin-mediated attachment of the

cells to the extracellular matrix and plays an essential role in
integrin signaling and tumorgenesis (31). Upon the interaction of
integrins with the extracellular matrix, FAK is autophosphorylated
at Y397. If further phosphorylated by Src at Y925, FAK is linked to the
Ras/Raf/MEK1/2/ERK1/2 pathway (30), and at Y861, its autophosphorylation is enhanced (32).
Overexpression and increased basal activity of FAK were
observed in schwannoma cells compared with Schwann cells
(Fig. 4D). FAK was strongly phosphorylated at Y397 (Fig. 4D, second,
third, and fourth panels), Y861, and Y925 (Fig. 4D, second and third
panels) in schwannoma cells. The phosphorylation intensity of
FAK at all sites investigated was not affected by PDGF-DD (Fig. 4D,
third panel).
To further investigate the relationship between FAK activation,
integrins, and basal ERK1/2 activity, we analyzed the cellular
localization of p-ERK1/2 and p-FAK using immunofluorescence
double labeling. p-ERK1/2 and p-FAK Y397 colocalize at focal
adhesions in schwannoma cells (Fig. 4D, fourth panel), suggesting
that the basal ERK activation is due to integrin-mediated activation
of the FAK/Src/Ras pathway.

PDGFRB-Mediated ERK1/2 Activation Employs PKCSrc-c-Raf and Involves Two Different Compartments
To define a specific mediator in the PDGFRh-mediated signaling
cascades toward ERK1/2 and AKT activation in schwannoma cells,
we performed a dissection of these pathways by using a variety of
different specific inhibitors. The specificity of signaling upon
PDGF-DD stimulation was confirmed by using the PDGFRh
inhibitor AG1296 (20 and 40 Amol/L; Fig. 5B).

We first focused on 42/44 kDa bands. Ras often plays an essential
role in the activation of the ERK1/2 via different mediators (33);
however, the main pathways are either via direct coupling to c-Raf
or via indirect c-Raf activation through the PI3K/phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate–dependent kinase-1 (PDK1)/PKC cascade (34).
The addition of PDGF-DD (100 ng/mL) for 3 minutes did not
further enhance Ras activity (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S2A,
compare rows 1 and 2), despite strong ERK1/2 activation at that
time point (data not shown). Additionally, FTI-277 (30 Amol/L)
did not inhibit PDGF-DD–mediated ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 5B, top,
row 9 and Supplementary Fig. S3, compare rows 2 and 3), suggesting that in schwannoma cells Ras is activated independently
of PDGFRh. The proper function of the FTI-277 is shown via Ras
pull-down (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B).
We next investigated the involvement of PI3K, which acts either
via Ras or via direct coupling to phosphorylated PDGFR (35),
resulting in elevated phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate levels, PKC activation via PDK1, and finally ERK1/2 activation. The
nonsubtype-selective PI3K inhibitors wortmannin (300 nmol/L)
and LY294002 (10 Amol/L; ref. 36) reduced PDGF-DD–mediated
ERK1/2 activation by 40% to 60% (Fig. 5B, top, columns 6 and 7).
In the PI3K-mediated cascade toward activation of ERK1/2, PKC
can be one of the mediators. We assessed the role of PKC using the
inhibitor of the classic and the novel PKC isoenzymes GF109203X
(37) and by prolonged exposure of the cells to the PKC activator
TPA (38). Both GF109203X (10 Amol/L) and TPA (100 nmol/L)
strongly inhibited PDGF-DD–mediated ERK1/2 activation by
f60% and 40%, respectively (Fig. 5B, top, columns 4 and 5).

Dissecting and Targeting ERK Pathway in Human Schwannoma

Figure 4. Dissection of the signaling pathway toward basal ERK1/2 activation in schwannoma cells. The following molecules were investigated: PAK (A) Ras
(B and C ), Src (C ), and FAK (D ). In all experiments, the cells were serum starved for 24 h, followed by stimulation for 10 min with complete medium (GFM; A) and 100
ng/mL PDGF-DD (D, third panel ). Western blot method was used in all experiments but D (fourth panel ), Ras pull-down was used in B, and immunocytochemistry
in D, fourth panel . A, PAK is not involved in ERK1/2 activation in basal conditions. Schwannoma cells were starved for 24 h and stimulated with GFM for 10 min.
The basal- and GFM- stimulated phosphorylation of c-Raf Ser338 (PAK phosphorylation site) and basal levels of phosphorylated MEK1/2 Ser298 (PAK phosphorylation
site) in schwannoma cells were estimated by Western blot (A, top and middle ). Cells were pretreated with the PAK inhibitor IPA-3 (20 Amol/L) for 10 min and
lysed, and the levels of basal ERK1/2 were determined (A, bottom ). B, Ras is strongly activated in schwannoma cells in serum-free conditions. Active Ras (Ras-GTP)
levels in Schwann (NF2+/+) and schwannoma (NF2 / ) cells were estimated by Ras pull-down and Western blot after the cells were serum starved for 24 h.
C, Ras and Src are involved in MEK1/2 activation in basal conditions. Cells were pretreated with farnesyl protein transferase inhibitor FTI-277 (30 Amol/L) and with Src
inhibitor SU6656 (4 Amol/L) for 30 min, and the level of phosphorylated MEK1/2 was determined. D, FAK is overexpressed and strongly activated in schwannoma
cells. FAK expression in Schwann (NF2+/+) and schwannoma (NF2 / ) cells was estimated by Western blot after the cells were serum starved for 24 h (first panel ). FAK
is strongly phosphorylated/activated in schwannoma cells (NF2 / ) compared with Schwann cells (NF2+/+). The cells were serum starved for 24 h, and the
levels of phosphorylated/activated FAK (Y397, Y861, and Y925) in Schwann and schwannoma cells were estimated by Western blot (second panel ). Basal FAK
activity is not further regulated by PDGF-DD. The cells were serum starved for 24 h and stimulated for 10 min with 100 ng/mL PDGF-DD. The basal- and
PDGF-DD–stimulated levels of p-FAK (Y397, Y861, and Y925) in schwannoma cells were estimated by Western blot (third panel ). Phosphorylated ERK1/2 and p-FAK
colocalize at focal adhesions in schwannoma cells. The colocalization of p-FAK with phosphorylated ERK1/2 in focal adhesions was performed after cells were
serum starved for 24 h. White arrowheads, colocalizing p-ERK1/2 and p-FAK Y397 in the focal adhesions (fourth panel ). B and D (first and second panels ),
data are normalized to NF2+/+. C and D (third panel ), data are normalized to the basal (nonstimulated cells). Dotted lines in C, noninhibited basal response and
comparisons to noninhibited response (100%). All Western blot data are corrected to loading control RhoGDI.

Src family protein kinases interact with the ERK1/2 pathway via
phosphorylation and activation of c-Raf or PKCy (39). Our data
show that PDGFRh activation in schwannoma cells leads to the
phosphorylation of c-Raf at the Src phosphorylation sites Y340/341

(data not shown). We thus investigated the involvement of Src in
PDGF-DD–mediated ERK1/2 activation using the selective Src
family kinase inhibitor SU6656 (4 Amol/L) that strongly inhibited
ERK1/2 activity (Fig. 5B, top, column 8).

Cancer Research

Additionally, we explored the involvement of c-Raf using the
specific inhibitor GW 5074 (5 Amol/L) that decreased ERK1/2
activity by 80% (Fig. 5B, top, column 2). PAK is not involved in
PDGFRh-mediated ERK1/2 activation in schwannoma cells, as
PDGF-DD treatment did not lead to phosphorylation of either
c-Raf at the PAK phosphorylation site (Ser338) or MEK1/2 at the
PAK phosphorylation site (Ser298; Fig. 5C, first and second panels).
Moreover PAK inhibitor IPA-3 displayed no effect on PDGFDD–stimulated activity of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 (Fig. 5C, third
panel, lines 1 and 3) excluding PAK as a mediator of this ERK1/2
cascade activation.
Using the same inhibitors as for investigation of the ERK1/2
pathway, we show that PDGF-DD–mediated AKT activation follows
the traditional pathway engaging PI3K since the inhibitors wortmannin (300 nmol/L) and LY294002 (10 Amol/L) strongly inhibited AKT
phosphorylation (Ser473; Fig. 5B, bottom, columns 7 and 8).
Thus, PDGFRh-mediated ERK1/2 activation displayed at the 42/44
kDa level is independent of Ras and PAK but uses PI3K-PKC-Src-cRaf–dependent pathway and cross-talk with AKT at the level of PI3K.

Despite similarities, such as involvement of c-Raf, PKC, and Src
(Fig. 5B, compare top and middle, columns 2, 4, 5, and 8) and
bypassing Ras (Fig. 5B, compare top and middle, column 9) the
activity of the ERK1/2 pathway at 42/44 kDa and 300 kDa differ
regarding the involvement of MEK1/2, PI3K (Fig. 5B, compare top
and middle, columns 3, 6, and 7), and PAK (Fig. 5C, third panel,
lines 2 and 3). In contrast to ERK1/2 activation at the 42/44 kDa
level that depends on PI3K and MEK1/2, the 300-kDa bands are
independent from those kinases. The engagement of PAK also
differs because PDGF-DD mediated ERK1/2 activity at the 300-kDa
level is almost completely inhibited by the PAK inhibitor IPA-3
(Fig. 5C third panel, line 2) whereas this, at 42/44 kDa, was
unaffected (Fig. 5C, third panel, line 3). Additional data obtained
by immunocytochemistry showed that IPA-3 completely abolished
the ERK1/2 activity in focal adhesions and membrane and also
eliminated the p-ERK1/2 clustering in the dot-like structures in
the cytosol. However, the total ERK1/2 activity in the cytosol was
unaffected, thus confirming Western blot data and suggesting PAK
acting as a scaffold in a complex containing ERK (Fig. 5C, fourth

cells. The ERK1/2 signaling pathway was
investigated by analyzing the involvement of
Ras (A and B); MEK1/2, PKC, PI3K, and
Src (B); PDGFRh and c-Raf (B and D);
and PAK (C). The AKT signaling pathway
was investigated by analyzing the
involvement of MEK1/2, PKC, PI3K, and
Src (B) and PDGFRh and c-Raf (B and D).
In all experiments, the cells were serum
starved for 24 h before the stimulation
with PDGF-DD (100 ng/mL; A–D) or
complete medium (GFM; C, first panel)
for 10 min (A; 3 min). The detection of
phosphorylated/activated proteins was
performed by Western blotting in all
experiments but C (fourth panel), where
immunocytochemistry method was used.
In A, Ras pull-down was performed before
Western blotting. In B, the cells were
pretreated with PDGFh inhibitor (AG1296),
c-Raf inhibitor (GW5074), MEK1/2 inhibitor
(U0126), PKC inhibitor (GF109203X), or
with PKC activator TPA, PI3K inhibitors
(Wortmannin and LY294002), Src inhibitor
(SU6656), and farnesyl protein transferase
inhibitor (FTI-277) before stimulation.
C, coupling of PAK to ERK1/2 cascade was
estimated using anti-phosphorylated c-Raf
Ser338 (first panel), anti–p-MEK1/2 Ser298
(second panel) antibodies, and PAK
inhibitor IPA-3 (20 Amol/L; third and fourth
panels). Fourth panel, the cells were
stimulated with PDGF-DD (100 ng/mL) for
10 min with and without IPA-3 (20 Amol/L)
and stained for p-ERK1/2 (green) and
paxillin (a focal adhesion marker, red).

Dissecting and Targeting ERK Pathway in Human Schwannoma

Figure 6. Signaling pathways involved in
the enhanced proliferation of schwannoma
cells. A, Schwann (NF2+/+) and
schwannoma cells(NF2 / ) were cultured
for 72 h with or without PDGF-DD. Total
cell amount was estimated by nuclear
staining with 5 Ag/mL Hoechst 33342 and
cell counting. B and C, schwannoma
cells were incubated with U0126 (MEK1/2
inhibitor), AG1296 (PDGFRh inhibitor),
and U0126 together with AG1296 (B ) and
sorafenib (PDGFRh and Raf inhibitor; C )
with and without PDGF-DD for 72 h.
BrdUrd (10 Amol/L) was added during the
last 24 h of the experiment. The amount
of proliferating cells (BrdUrd-positive)
was assessed by cell counting. In all
experiments, the data are normalized
to the basal level (nonstimulated cells).
D, signaling pathways targeted by
sorafenib in schwannoma cells. Merlin
deficiency leads to the activation of Ras,
overexpression and activation of integrins,
and overexpression and postponed
degradation of PDGFRh. Ras and integrins
trigger basal ERK1/2 activity via FAK,
which is strongly overexpressed and
phosphorylated/activated by Src. Basal

panel). Thus, our data indicate that PDGF-DD–mediated ERK1/2
activation at the 300-kDa level engages c-Raf, PKC, src, and PAK
and localizes to the different cellular compartments than active
ERK1/2 observed at the 42/44 kDa level.
In summary, we found two major mechanisms converging
toward ERK1/2 activation in schwannoma cells: (a) basal
activation via integrins/src/FAK/Ras and (b) PDGFRh-mediated
via the PI3K-PKC-c-Raf and PKC-PAK-c-Raf pathways were the first
mentioned cross talk with and strongly activate AKT (Fig. 6D).
We thus chose sorafenib (1 and 10 Amol/L), an inhibitor of
PDGFR and c-Raf (Fig. 6D) already used in clinic, which efficiently
inhibited both basal- and PDGF-DD–stimulated ERK1/2 and AKT
activity (Fig. 5D), suggesting that this compound has a potential
therapeutic effect on schwannoma.

PDGFRB Induces Enhanced Cell Proliferation, but not
Adhesion, via ERK1/2 in Schwannoma Cells
We next assessed the functional role of PDGFRh-mediated
ERK1/2 activation in schwannoma cells.
Adhesion. First, we performed an adhesion assay (6) where cells
were cultured in three different conditions: DMEM only, DMEM
with 100 ng/mL PDGF-DD, and complete medium (GFM). Only
GFM but not PDFG-DD alone induced schwannoma cell adhesion
(data not shown); thus, it is unlikely that PDGFRh alone play a role
in this process.
Proliferation. We have previously shown that schwannoma cells
display an increased proliferation rate compared with Schwann
cells (40). As PDGF is a potent growth factor in several cell types,

www.aacrjournals.org

we tested its mitogenic potency in our in vitro model. The addition
of 100 ng/mL PDGF-DD for 72 hours resulted in an increase of total
cell number (determined by Hoechst 33342 staining of the nucleus)
by f40% in schwannoma cells, whereas no mitogenic effect on
Schwann cells was detected (Fig. 6A) under our culture conditions.
Additional experiments measuring BrdUrd incorporation revealed
that schwannoma cells displayed basal proliferation activity,
which was strongly potentiated by PDGF-DD by f80% (Fig. 6B
and C), indicating that PDGF-DD is a potent mitogen for human
primary schwannoma cells. Both MEK1/2 and PDGFR inhibitors
U0126 (1 Amol/L) and AG1296 (20 Amol/L), respectively, strongly
reduced PDGF-DD–mediated as well basal cell proliferation
(Fig. 6B), suggesting that the ERK1/2 pathway is involved in
PDGFRh-mediated proliferation in schwannoma cells. Next, we
tested sorafenib (0.1, 0.5, and 1 Amol/L), a PDGFR and c-Raf
inhibitor that is currently approved for clinical use in advanced
RCC. Interestingly, 0.5 Amol/L sorafenib effectively inhibited PDGFDD but not basal and 1 Amol/L inhibited both PDGF-DD–mediated
and basal proliferation in schwannoma cells (Fig. 6C), suggesting
that this component could be used for schwannoma treatment.

Discussion
We show strong and prolonged ERK1/2 pathway activation in
human primary schwannoma cells compared with primary
Schwann cells. PDGFRh is strongly overexpressed in human
primary schwannoma cells in agreement with a previous
observation in human schwannoma tissue (18). Insulin and h

heregulin activate ERK1/2 only weakly, even when used at high
concentrations. FGFa and EGF fail to activate ERK1/2. Additionally,
the expression levels of ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors are equal in
human schwannoma and Schwann cells. EGFR is present in the rat
schwannoma cell line RT4 (data not shown), but not in human
primary Schwann and schwannoma cells. Thus, PDGFRh is a
crucial receptor signaling through ERK1/2 pathway in human
schwannoma.
In addition to the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, PDGF-DD
also evokes a strong and prolonged AKT response in schwannoma
cells compared with Schwann cells. Although PDGFRh is important
for the activation of the AKT pathway, as shown here, we cannot
exclude that, in different physiologic milieu, other growth factors
could also be involved in activation of this pathway.
PDGFRh displays a postponed degradation in schwannoma cells
compared with Schwann cells, in agreement with a previous study
on human schwannoma cell line HEI193 (18). The receptor activity
is prolonged and, 1 hour after stimulation, decreased only by
50% of maximum response. The kinetics of PDGFR deactivation
is usually much faster, as shown in fibroblasts, where already
20 minutes after stimulation the activity dropped by 75% (41). Our
data suggest that one of functions of merlin is to regulate the
receptor activity. PDGFRh phosphorylation/activity display the
same pattern as MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity, but diverge from
AKT, which exhibit strong activity even 24 hours after stimulation.
Thus, in schwannoma cells, AKT activation is regulated not only at
the PDGFRh level but possibly also by positive feedback
mechanisms downstream of the receptor, e.g., saturation of PI3K
activity (41), prolongation of signaling in endosomes (42), or
activation of phosphatase inhibitors (43). These human data
extend the observations made in the rat schwannoma cell line RT4
and in a mouse NF2 / Schwann cell line, where receptor expression and function were not affected by merlin (16). In addition to
strong and long-lasting PDGF-DD–mediated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2
activity, schwannoma cells display stronger basal activity of these
kinases compared with Schwann cells. This could involve either
Rac/PAK or integrin-mediated pathways. PAK can be excluded
as an activator of ERK1/2 at 42/44kDa level, which is the main
ERK1/2 band in basal conditions, as c-Raf is not phosphorylated
at its PAK phosphorylation site (Ser338) and analysis of the PAKdependent phosphorylation site on MEK1/2 (Ser298) shows that
schwannoma and Schwann cells display similar phosphorylation
levels. Also, the PAK inhibitor IPA-3 inhibited neither basal- nor
PDGF-DD–stimulated MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 activity. This is an
unexpected finding because the Rac1/PAK pathway is strongly
up-regulated in schwannoma cells (8) and PAK is known to act
as a scaffold to enhance ERK1/2 activity (44). However, we found
instead that ERK1/2 activity at the 300-kDa level, prominent after
PDGF stimulation, is dependent from PAK that likely acts as a
scaffold. Moreover, the activation of the ERK1/2 at the 300-kDa
level displays also other differences from this at 42/44 kDa, as it
bypasses PI3K and MEK1/2. A potential explanation could be
hidden binding sites for those inhibitors caused by complex
formation. Immunocytochemistry also show the differential
distribution of p-ERK1/2 in schwannoma cells (nucleus, cytosol,
membrane, and focal adhesions). Our data thus suggest that PDGFDD mediates the activation of ERK1/2 in different cellular
compartments which display different molecular background. We
next tested the role of integrins that are up-regulated in
schwannoma (6) and may activate ERK1/2 via the FAK/src/Ras
pathway (29). We detected enhanced basal activity of Ras, MEK1/2,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

and ERK1/2 and increased expression and activation of FAK in
schwannoma cells. Additionally, p-FAK colocalizes with p-ERK1/2
in focal adhesions. Moreover, blocking of Ras and Src inhibit basal
MEK1/2 activity. Taken together, these results indicate that integrins are likely to contribute to ERK1/2 activation in schwannoma
cells via the FAK/src/Ras pathway under basal conditions. We
think that in basal conditions schwannoma cells display activation
of the integrin/FAK/Src cascade, as well as increased levels of
active Ras, which, upon coupling to p-FAK (Y925), leads to
activation of ERK1/2.
As the stimulation of PDGFRh strongly potentiates ERK1/2 and
AKT activity, we consider that this receptor and its downstream
signaling pathways is important for schwannoma development. To
define a potential therapeutic target for schwannoma treatment,
we performed a dissection of the cascades downstream of PDGFRh
in addition to basal activation. Our data suggest cooperation
between PI3K, PKC, and Src in PDGF-DD–mediated ERK1/2
activation. Although Ras is strongly activated in schwannoma cells
and implicated in basal signaling toward ERK1/2 activation, it is
not further activated by PDGF-DD and is not involved in the
PDGFRh-mediated pathway. This could be explained by a possible
uncoupling of Ras from the receptor. Different Ras isoforms
localize to distinct microdomains within plasma membrane and
different intracellular compartments leading to diverse signal
outputs despite interaction with similar activators and effectors
(45). Ras insensitivity to PDGF-DD could also be explained by
either saturated basal activity of Ras or a negative feedback from
basal ERK1/2 to Grb2-Sos (Ras-GEF; ref. 46). Our data somehow
contradicts previous findings, showing Ras involved in PDGFRhmediated ERK1/2 activation (16). This discrepancy may be down to
the use of rat schwannoma cell line caused by different mutation
and displaying malignant properties by Morrison and colleagues,
whereas we focused our study on primary human schwannoma.
We show that PDGF-DD engages different pathways to activate
ERK1/2 that is localized to different intracellular compartments
and detected at different molecular weight levels by Western blot.
The p-ERK1/2 pathway at 42/44 kDa (cytosol) favors a model in
which c-Raf is activated by Src and PKC, where the later is
activated by PI3K (via PDK1), which directly binds to phosphorylated/activated PDGFRh (Fig. 6D; refs. 47, 48). PI3K acts also as a
convergence point to the activation of AKT (Fig. 6D). The p-ERK1/2
pathway at 300-kDa level ( focal adhesions) engages c-Raf, PKC, Src,
and PAK. Our data thus fit to previous observations showing that
ERK1/2 activity is tightly regulated by merlin (17) and involved in
rat Schwann cells dedifferentiation (13) and integrin-mediated cell
motility and adhesion (14), which is dramatically disregulated in
merlin-deficient schwannoma cells (6).
Whereas transient ERK1/2 activity is important for normal cell
function, a strong and long-lasting ERK1/2 activation can be
mitogenic (49, 50). We show increased proliferation of schwannoma
cells upon stimulation with PDGF-DD, whereas no effects were
observed in Schwann cells. This could be explained either by the
short and weak ERK1/2 activity in those cells or a requirement
for additional factors in the culture medium, such as insulin-like
growth factors (51). Inhibition of MEK1/2 decreases PDGF-DD–
mediated proliferation to basal levels, suggesting that ERK1/2 pathway is involved in this process. Additionally, both MEK1/2 and
PDGFRh inhibition significantly inhibited basal cell proliferation,
suggesting that both the integrin/FAK/src/Ras cascade and
PDGFRh-mediated signaling, possibly via autocrine mechanisms,
are involved in schwannoma cell proliferation.

Dissecting and Targeting ERK Pathway in Human Schwannoma

Based on this evidence, we consider PDGFRh-mediated signaling
to be involved in schwannoma development. Additionally, the
integrin-mediated FAK/src/Ras cascade contributes to basal ERK1/2
activity, thereby potentiating the PDGFRh-specific pathway (Fig. 6D;
ref. 16).
Because different pathways are involved in schwannoma cell
proliferation, we suggest that a combined therapy targeting different
proteins might be appropriate for treating schwannoma. Promising
therapeutic agent include sorafenib, a PDGFR and Raf inhibitor
already approved for use in patients with advanced RCC, as it inhibits
efficiently both basal and PDGF-DD–mediated ERK1/2 and AKT
activation and proliferation in human primary schwannoma cells.
