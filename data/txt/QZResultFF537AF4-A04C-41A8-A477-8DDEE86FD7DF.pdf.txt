BACKGROUND: The objective of identifying protein biomarkers for patients with stage III and IV colorectal cancer is
to improve risk stratification and, thus, to identify patients in the postoperative setting who may benefit from more
targeted treatment. The objective of the current study was to determine the prognostic value of 19 protein markers
assessed in primary tumors and matched lymph node (LN) metastases from patients with stage III and IV colorectal
cancer. METHODS: Matched primary tumors and LN metastases from 82 patients with stage III and IV colorectal cancer were mounted onto a multiple-punch tissue microarray and were stained for 19 protein markers involved in tumor
progression (b-catenin, E-cadherin, epidermal growth factor receptor, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated
kinase [pERK], receptor for hyaluronic acid-mediated motility, phosphorylated protein kinase B, p21, p16, B-cell lymphoma 2, Ki67, apoptotic protease activating factor 1, mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1, Raf kinase inhibitor protein,
vascular endothelial growth factor, ephrin type-B receptor 2, matrix metalloproteinase 7, laminin5c2, mucin 1 [MUC1],
and caudal-related homeobox 2). The prognostic effects of biomarkers in both primary tumor and positive LNs were
assessed. RESULTS: MUC1, pERK and p16 in LN (P ¼ .002, P ¼ .014, and P ¼ .002, respectively) had independent
prognostic value. In patients with stage III disease who received adjuvant treatment, negative p16 expression was
associated with highly unfavorable outcomes overall (hazard ratio [HR], 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1-0.6; P
¼ .005) when the analysis was stratified by pathologic tumor classification (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7; P ¼ .005), age
(HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.1-0.6; P ¼ .004), and LN ratio (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7; P ¼ .007); and, in multivariate analysis, it
was associated with performance status and the receipt of folic acid treatment (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.89; P ¼
.03). CONCLUSIONS: The loss of p16 in LN metastases contributed to adverse outcomes in adjuvantly treated patients with
stage III colorectal cancer independent of pathologic tumor classification, age, LN ratio, performance status, or folic acid
treatment. The current results support the investigation of p16 as a prognostic and potential predictive biomarker for future

Lymph node metastasis is considered the most important prognostic factor for patients with colorectal cancer.1 Studies
have confirmed that a lymph node yield of a minimum of 12 lymph nodes is critical for the accurate staging of patients.
Despite these guidelines, striking differences in the numbers of lymph nodes retrieved have been reported between institutions2; in particular, approximately 50% of Dukes B colorectal cancers appear to be under staged,3 and inadequate lymph

node sampling has been discussed as a ‘‘high-risk’’ feature
for patients with TNM stage II disease.4 The lymph node
ratio (LNR), which is defined as the total number of positive/total number of lymph nodes collected, also has been
highlighted as an important prognostic factor for patients
with stage III (including stage IIIB and IIIC) colon cancer.5-8
In patients with metastatic lymph node disease, adjuvant therapy has become the standard of care.9 However, it is recognized that patients within this same
disease stage may experience different clinical outcomes.10
The objective of identifying protein biomarkers for
patients with stage III and IV colorectal cancer is to
improve risk stratification and, thus, to identify patients
in the postoperative setting who may benefit from more
targeted treatment. To date, this goal largely has not been
reached, although a series of markers has been associated
with a greater probability of observing lymph node metastasis and has sparked interest as a possible indicator
of poor outcome in patients with lymph node-negative
disease.11-15
Prognostic biomarker studies in colorectal cancer
clearly focus on the expression of proteins in primary tumor and correlating that expression with clinical endpoints. However, to date, very few reports have focused
on the comparison of protein markers between primary
tumor and corresponding lymph nodes,16 and a systematic evaluation of prognosis based on lymph node expression of protein markers has yet to be performed.
The first step in such an investigation is the retrospective study of potential biomarkers in tissues from
patients with known outcomes.17 To this end, we evaluated 19 protein markers in both primary tumor and
matched lymph node metastases from 82 patients with
stage III and IV colorectal cancer. With patients stratified
by disease stage and treatment, the objective of this study
was to compare the prognostic performance of these
markers according to tissue type and, thus, to identify
prognostic and potential predictive biomarkers in patients
who received adjuvant therapy. Protein markers were
selected to represent the most important signaling pathways and cellular processes that contribute to colorectal
cancer progression, prognosis, and response to therapy.
For example, it has been demonstrated that the inactivation of Wnt signaling is linked to epithelial mesenchymal
transition and is characterized by the overexpression of
nuclear b-catenin and loss of membranous E-cadherin
expression, both of which are studied here.18 RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/MAPK) signaling and

protein kinase B/phosphatase and tensin homolog (AKT/
PTEN) signaling are key regulators of colorectal progression.19 Most recently, mutations in key components of
these pathways, including v-Ki-ras Kirsten rat sarcoma
viral oncogene homolog (K-RAS), v-raf murine sarcoma
viral oncogene homolog B1 (B-RAF), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic a polypeptide (PIK3CA) have
been linked to nonresponsiveness in patients with metastatic disease who received antiepidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) therapy.20 Therefore, in the current
study, we evaluated EGFR, phosphorylated extracellular
signal-regulated protein kinase (pERK), receptor for hyaluronic acid-mediated motility (RHAMM), and phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) for their prognostic
effects in primary tumor and lymph nodes.21 Proteins
involved in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, or proliferation (p21, p16, B-cell lymphoma 2 [Bcl-2], Ki67, apoptotic protease activating factor 1 [APAF-1], and mammalian
sterile 20-like kinase 1 [MST1]) can have a major effect
on patient response to chemotherapeutic agents22;
whereas proteins like Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP),
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), ephrin type-B
receptor 2 (EphB2), matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7),
laminin5c2 (lam5c2), mucin 1 (MUC1), and caudalrelated homeobox 2 (CDX2) are linked to angiogenesis,
lymph node positivity, or distant metastasis.23-27 To
account for possible heterogeneity in tumor protein
expression, multiple-punch tissue microarrays (TMAs)
were used.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Eighty-two nonconsecutive patients with primary colorectal cancer and TNM stage III or IV disease who were
treated at the Fourth Department of Surgery, University
of Athens Medical School between 2004 and 2006 were
entered into the study. All histomorphologic data were
reviewed from the corresponding hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained slides, and clinical data were obtained
from corresponding reports. Clinicopathologic information for all 82 patients included sex, age, greatest tumor
dimension, histologic subtype, tumor location, pathologic
tumor (pT) classification, pathologic lymph node (pN)
status, pathologic metastasis (pM) status, vascular and
lymphatic invasion, survival, and postoperative therapy.
For 72 of the 82 patients, information also was available
for chemotherapy regimen, performance status, and folic
acid intake. Characteristics of the patients with matched

Specimen Characteristics
Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of primary tumors and
corresponding positive lymph nodes were retrieved from
the Second Department of Pathology, University of Athens Medical School (Attikon University Hospital),
Greece. The use of this material was approved by the local
ethics committee of the University of Athens. Two TMAs
from these patients were constructed. For each patient,
the H&E-stained slides of the primary tumor and lymph
nodes from the corresponding whole tissue sections were
evaluated, and representative areas of tissue were marked
using a felt-tip pen for easy detection. To exclude bias
because of possible tumor heterogeneity, each patient had
multiple tissue and tumor punches taken from formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded blocks using a tissue cylinder
with a diameter of 0.6 mm, and the punches subsequently
were transferred into 1 recipient paraffin block (3  2.5
cm) using a homemade, semiautomated tissue arrayer.
Tissues were obtained from the tumor center, the invasive
tumor front, the normal adjacent mucosa (if available),
and the transitional zone (the region where tumor and adjacent normal tissue coincide), if available. Each patient
on average had 5.1 tissue punches included on this array,
including 4 tumor punches (2 from the tumor center and
2 from the invasive tumor front). The second TMA
included single punches from matched metastatic lymph
nodes in all 82 patients. Only 1 punch from affected
lymph nodes was taken, and this was considered sufficient
to study the expression of biomarkers in these affected tissues; the size and the distribution of tumor within the
lymph nodes suggested that variations in protein expression were minimal.
Assay Methods
Five-micrometer TMA sections were dewaxed and rehydrated in distilled water. Endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked using 0.5% H2O2. After pressure cookermediated antigen retrieval in 0.001 M ethylene diamine
tetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 8.0, the sections were incubated with 10% normal goat serum (DAKO, Carpentaria,
Calif) for 20 minutes. To determine mismatch-repair status, the tumor samples were incubated with primary antibody for mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) (clone MLH-1; BD
Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif; dilution,
1:100), mutS homolog 2 (MSH2) (clone MSH-2; BD

(polyclonal; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY; di8ution, 1:1000), and VEGF (clone A20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif; dilution, 1:100). Subsequently,
the sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DakoCytomation) for 30
minutes at room temperature. For visualization of the antigen, the sections were immersed in 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole plus substrate/chromogen (DakoCytomation) for 30
minutes and counterstained with Gill hematoxylin. The primary antibody was omitted for negative controls and was
replaced by buffer. For a positive control, a TMA with various tissue samples was stained in parallel and included 30
carcinoma tissues (10 breast cancers, 10 prostate cancers, and
10 colon cancers) and 80 normal tissues (4 adrenal gland tissues; 8 colon tissues; and 4 tissues from normal endometrium, epidydymis, heart, kidney, lung, pancreas, parotid
gland, placenta, prostate, skin, spleen, stomach, striated muscle, thymus, thyroid gland, lymph node, and tonsil).
Immunohistochemistry was evaluated by semiquantitatively assessing the percentage of positive cells per
TMA punch. Because multiple tissue punches were
obtained for all primary tumors, the average protein
expression was obtained across all punches per patient and
per tumor localization. For the matched positive lymph

as those from the transitional zone were not included in
the analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Differences in the median protein expression for all
markers between primary tumors and matched lymph
nodes were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
To exclude the probability of observing a chance association because of multiple testing, a Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons was performed. To reject the
null hypothesis of no difference in survival time, only
markers that resulted in survival with P values <.003 were
considered significantly different. Negative and positive
protein expression was assigned by classifying patients
around the median expression value for primary tumors
and lymph nodes. Differences in the length of survival
were illustrated using the Kaplan-Meier method and were
analyzed using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis was carried out to determine prognostic differences between negative and positive protein
expression after testing the proportional hazards assumption. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were obtained. Baseline hazards of 1.0 consistently
were attributed to negative staining. Therefore, an HR
>1.0 indicates a detrimental effect of positive staining on
prognosis, whereas an HR <1.0 suggests a beneficial effect
of positive staining on outcome. Multiple regression

analysis of the markers that were identified as significant
in univariate analysis was performed by including metastasis and adjuvant therapy. Next, these independent
markers were entered into a multiple regression analysis
using a forward selection process and a Type I error of a
¼ .01. All P values were 2-sided. Analyses were performed
using SAS software (version 9; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Prognostic Differences in Primary Tumor and
Matched Lymph Node Metastases
The expression of 3 proteins in primary tumors resulted
in prognostic differences. A poorer outcome was observed
for patients with tumors that had positive MUC1 expression (P ¼ .048), positive pERK expression (P ¼ .017),
and loss of RKIP expression (P ¼ .05) (Fig. 2). However,
only pERK and RKIP were identified as independent
prognostic factors after adjusting for the presence of distant metastasis and adjuvant therapy (pERK, P ¼ .012;
RKIP, P ¼ .009) (Table 3).
The expression of 4 markers in lymph node metastases led to significant differences in prognosis. Poorer outcome was observed for patients who had lymph nodes
with positive MUC1 expression (P ¼ .03) and positive
pERK expression (P ¼ .049), whereas a more favorable
prognosis was attributed to positive expression of p16 (P
¼ .014) and E-cadherin (P ¼ .013) (Fig. 3). In a multivariate analysis of each marker that included distant metastasis and adjuvant therapy, only MUC1 (P ¼ .002), pERK
(P ¼ .014), and p16 (P ¼ .002) were identified as independent prognostic factors.

RESULTS
Association Between Clinicopathologic
Features and Survival in Univariate Analysis
Survival information was available for 81 of 82 patients.
The 5-year survival rate for the entire cohort was 38.9%
(Fig. 1). Significantly poorer outcomes were observed for
patients who had more advanced pN status (P ¼ .006), M
status (P < .001), vascular invasion (P < .001), lymphatic
invasion (P ¼ .008), adjuvant therapy (P < .001), chemotherapy regimen (P < .001), and higher performance status (P < .001); whereas marginal differences were noted
for patients stratified according to histologic diagnosis (P
¼ .056) and folic acid intake (P ¼ .056). No differences
in prognosis were observed according to sex, tumor location, pT classification, or tumor grade.

Comparison of the Prognostic Performance
of Proteins in Primary Tumor and Lymph
Node Metastases
To determine the most competitive protein marker
expressed in primary tumor, multivariate survival analysis
was performed by including into the model the following
variables: pERK, RKIP, MUC1, metastasis, and adjuvant
therapy (Table 4). By using a forward selection procedure,
positive expression of pERK and adjuvant treatment
maintained their significant effects on outcome. By using
the same approach for protein expression in the lymph
nodes and including p16, MUC1, pERK, metastasis, and
adjuvant therapy in the multivariate analysis, we observed
that all 5 variables independently predicted prognosis.
When comparing the HRs, loss of p16 expression in positive lymph nodes was attributed to a 5.56-fold greater risk
of death compared with positive p16 expression when the
model was adjusted for all remaining prognostic factors,
indicated that p16 was the most competitive prognostic
marker in positive lymph nodes. Furthermore, we compared differences in survival according to pERK

In primary tumors, the expression of pERK and RKIP were independent

38 of 51 patients (74.5%) who were positive (10%
staining in tumor cell nuclei) for p16 in lymph node metastases (Fig. 5). These included 24 patients who received
combined capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX); 8
patients who received combined folonic acid (leucovorin),
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX); 2
patients who received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab; 8
patients who received 5-FU plus folic acid (FUFA); 4
patients who received FUFA plus irinotecan; 2 patients
who received combined capecitabine, irinotecan, and bevacizumab; and 4 patients who received capecitabine. The
overall survival for these patients is illustrated in Figure
5A. The highly unfavorable impact of negative p16
expression in lymph node metastases on outcome for this
group was underlined by an HR of 0.26 (95%CI, 0.1-0.6;
P ¼ .005) (Fig. 5B).
This result was maintained again when T classification was considered (HR, 0.25; 95%CI, 0.1-0.7; P ¼
.005) (Fig. 5C,D). Because p16 expression reportedly is
modified by patient age, we evaluated the independent
prognostic effect of p16 expression adjusting for age at diagnosis. Both p16 (HR, 0.24; 95%CI, 0.1-0.6; P ¼ .004)
and patient age (HR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.88-0.99; P ¼ .045)
were significant independent prognostic indicators for
patients with stage III disease who received adjuvant
therapy.
A multivariate analysis of p16 expression was performed again that included both performance status and
folic acid intake in the model. Negative expression of p16
remained an independent prognostic factor (HR, 0.29;
95%CI, 0.09-0.89; P ¼ .03), whereas performance status
and folic acid intake no longer were linked significantly to
outcome (P ¼ .184 and P ¼ .295, respectively). This
effect is illustrated in Figure 5E-G. Because only 3
patients with a performance status of 0 were negative for
p16 expression, no survival analysis could be performed.
The adverse effect of p16 expression was maintained after
adjusting for the LNR (HR, 0.26; 95%CI, 0.1-0.7; P ¼
.007). Finally, p16 negativity led to a poorer outcome in
patients who received either XELOX (P ¼ .009) or chemotherapy other then XELOX (P ¼ .046) (Fig. 5H,I).

DISCUSSION
The major findings of this study indicate that negative
lymph node expression of p16 in patients with stage III
disease who receive adjuvant therapy is a highly adverse
prognostic factor in this subgroup. Moreover, the prognostic effect of p16 on outcome was independent of pT

classification, patient age, LNR, performance status, treatment with folic acid, and chemotherapy regimen, underlining its value as a prognostic indicator.
In a first step, we investigated differences in the protein expression of 19 markers between primary tumors
and matched lymph node metastases; and we identified
RHAMM, Ki67, pAKT, VEGF, APAF-1, and MST1 as
significantly decreased in lymph node metastases. It is
noteworthy that all of these proteins play crucial roles in
proliferation or apoptosis and are implicated directly both
in the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway and in the pAKT
signaling pathway.19,29-31 Differences in protein expression between primary tumors and matched lymph nodes
rarely have been documented. However, Deng and colleagues recently published their TMA work evaluating

Cancer

EGFR expression in both matched primary tumors and
lymph nodes.16 Those authors reported no effect of
EGFR expression in primary tumors on survival in
patients with stage III or IV disease but noted an adverse
prognostic effect with high EGFR expression in lymph
node metastases. We could not confirm those findings in
the current study despite the use of a similar sample size
and similar methodology. This discrepancy is likely
because of the different methods that were used for protein marker evaluation (semiquantitative scoring vs composite scoring system). A representative immunostain is
shown in Figure 6.
Although significant differences between primary
tumor and lymph node metastases were observed for 6
protein markers, none of these had effects on outcome

when they were assessed in either sample type. Positivity
for pERK and loss of RKIP in the primary tumor were
linked to poorer survival independent of the presence of
distant metastasis and adjuvant therapy. These findings
are in agreement with several larger colorectal cancer prognostic studies.23,32-34 Lymph node expression of pERK
and MUC1 and loss of p16 expression also were identified
as independent features of poor outcome. In particular,
p16 appeared to play a more important role in predicting

prognosis than any other marker, including pERK, in
both primary tumors and lymph node metastases.
A member of the INK4 class of cell-cycle inhibitors,
p16 functions as a tumor suppressor gene that is active in
cell-cycle regulation and in the angiogenic switch.35 The
main mechanism of p16 inactivation is promoter hypermethylation, which can be detected in 12.5% to 47% of
colorectal cancers and appears to be age-dependent.36-41
In lymph node metastases, aberrant activation of p16 by
methylation reportedly occurs in 14% of patients.42 Hypermethylation of p16 has important implications for
prognosis, is linked to colorectal cancers with high microsatellite instability, and also is considered among the elements of a classic panel for detection of the CpG island
methylator phenotype.37,40,43-49 The methylation of p16,
as evaluated in DNA extracted from primary tumors, peritoneal lavage fluid, and serum from patients with colorectal cancer, has been related to more advanced tumor
stage and to significantly poorer overall and disease-free
survival rates.37,45,50,51 It is noteworthy that protein
expression of p16 is correlated inversely with the degree of
methylation, supporting the argument that immunohistochemistry for the protein could be used as a surrogate
marker for p16 epigenetic silencing.47 Furthermore, the
use of p16 protein expression has been suggested as a
screening tool for the selection of patients who undergo
genetic testing for Lynch syndrome.47 Few studies have
assessed the potential predictive value of p16 in colorectal
cancer in vitro and in vivo.52,53 However, Kamoshida and
colleagues compared p16 and thymidylate synthase
expression in preoperative biopsies and postsurgical

resection specimens and observed significant overexpression of p16 in resection specimens from patients who had
a response to 5-FU-based chemotherapy compared with
nonresponders and controls.54 Our major novel findings
suggest that negative p16 expression evaluated in lymph
nodes, rather than in primary tumors, from patients with
stage III disease who received adjuvant therapy is a highly
adverse prognostic indicator. In fact, negative p16 expression was related to worse survival in both pT3 and pT4
disease and was independent of patient age, LNR, performance status, treatment with folic acid, and chemotherapy regimen.
In this study, we used the TMA technique with multiple tissue punches per patient to account for possible
heterogeneity in terms of protein expression in the primary tumor. Each patient had an average of 4 tumor
punches taken, including 2 samples from the tumor center
and 2 from the tumor border, where changes in certain
protein markers can be most prevalent. Therefore, tumor
heterogeneity was minimized by such sampling and by
evaluating the average protein expression across the total
number of samples. Our results fulfilled the requirements
set by Goethals and coworkers, who recommend taking at
least 3 or 4 punches of primary tumor to account for possible biases in protein evaluation.55 For lymph nodes, the
issue of heterogeneity is likely to be substantially less important because of the size and distribution of tumor
within the lymph node itself. The evaluation of H&Estained slides before TMA construction allowed us to distinguish positive lymph nodes from unaffected lymph
nodes, to sample the most representative affected lymph
nodes, and to identify the specific areas to be punched.
Therefore, only a single punch of a lymph node was
obtained and evaluated for protein marker expression.
However, our study was limited to a relatively small number of patients with stage III and IV colorectal cancer who
had matched primary tumors and lymph nodes (n ¼ 82),
and only a single tissue punch was obtained from the
lymph nodes.
The current results provide evidence supporting the
investigation of potential prognostic biomarkers in lymph
node metastases from patients with stage III and IV colorectal cancer. Moreover, our findings indicate that, in
patients with stage III disease and lymph node metastases
who receive treatment with adjuvant therapy, negative
expression of p16 is an independent prognostic factor in
the postoperative setting. Although our current study did
not allow us to determine the predictive value of lymph
node p16 expression regarding response to adjuvant ther-

issue in randomized controlled trials is warranted.
