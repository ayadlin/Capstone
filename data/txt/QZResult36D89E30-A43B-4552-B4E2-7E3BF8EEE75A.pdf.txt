BACKGROUND: Patients with early-stage, nonbulky classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) undergo intensive posttreatment radiologic surveillance despite having a low risk of disease recurrence. The current study attempted to evaluate the risk of disease recurrence and
the value of radiologic surveillance in patients treated with the combination of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine
(ABVD) alone who achieved a complete remission (CR) as noted on posttreatment positron emission tomography (PET). METHODS:
Forty-seven patients who underwent therapy with interim and/or posttreatment PET scans were evaluated for disease recurrence
during  24 months of follow-up. Their presenting characteristics and imaging results were assessed and interpreted in relation to
clinical outcome. RESULTS: All 47 patients were eligible for analysis. The majority of patients were female (35 patients) with a median
age of 28 years (range, 17 years-65 years.). The nodular sclerosing subtype was the predominant histology (41 patients). A total of 34
patients were staged with IIA disease, 6 with IA disease, 6 with IIB disease, and 1 with IIEA disease (lung) (according to Cotswolds
modification of the Ann Arbor staging system). All patients completed 6 cycles of planned ABVD therapy and achieved a CR. Two
had a positive PET scan (1 interim scan and 1 posttreatment scan); both were biopsy-proven sarcoidosis. Two patients developed disease recurrence at 7 months and 24 months, respectively, after negative interim and posttreatment imaging. One case of recurrence
was identified through surveillance imaging and the other was identified simultaneously by the patient and surveillance scan. A total
of 45 patients experienced a durable CR; 21 had additional unscheduled imaging/workup during surveillance to investigate symptoms
or imaging signs of concern. CONCLUSIONS: Because of a low risk of disease recurrence, posttreatment radiologic surveillance
appears to be unnecessary in patients with early-stage, nonbulky (CD20 negative) cHL who achieve a PET-detected CR with the
ABVD combination alone. This will reduce cumulative radiation exposure and health care costs in a predominantly young patient popC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
The goal of treatment in patients with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is cure and impressive 5-year overall survival
rates of 90% have been reported in patients with early-stage disease.1 To minimize late treatment-related effects, research
has now turned toward risk stratification and reducing treatment to improve mortality and morbidity without compromising outcome. Accordingly, there has been a shift in the treatment paradigm toward using chemotherapy alone2-4 or
reducing the number of chemotherapy cycles and/or the radiation dose/field in combined modality treatment (CMT)5 in
patients with early-stage, nonbulky cHL.
Paradoxically, although reductions in therapeutic radiation exposure in patients with cHL are currently being made,
the use of diagnostic imaging to evaluate disease has grown with the advent of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG), computed tomography (CT), and radiographs. Although posttherapy imaging is justified to manage patients with early disease recurrence using salvage therapy, there are concerns regarding
cumulative radiation exposure and the potential risks.6 This is pertinent in cases of early-stage, nonbulky cHL because
patients are usually young with a low risk of disease recurrence.5 Moreover, evidence suggests that most cases of disease
recurrence are identified independently of imaging7-11 and the benefit for earlier disease detection is minimal,12 leading
some clinicians to call for a reduction in the use of imaging, with European guidelines recommending no routine CT follow-up altogether.13

Original Article

Based on the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center (MSKCC) report demonstrating the equivalence
of ABVD with CMT,2 patients with early-stage, nonbulky cHL have been treated, off protocol, with 6 cycles
of the combination of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) alone since 2004. In this
retrospective study, we assessed their outcome within the
context of radiographic findings throughout treatment
and follow-up to identify whether a complete remission
(CR) noted on PET scan after ABVD alone can predict a
durable remission and obviate the need for further posttherapy follow-up imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

We queried the MSKCC institutional database Webbased data search engine (DAVInCI) to identify patients
who were treated with 6 cycles of ABVD without
radiotherapeutic consolidation from January 1, 2002 to
December 31, 2008. DAVInCI is an MSKCC Webbased application that enables independently run data
queries. Patients were eligible if they met the following
criteria: early stage (IA to IIB), nonbulky (single lymph
node mass measuring <10 cm or a mediastinal mass
33% of the maximum transverse transthoracic diameter on a standard posteroanterior chest radiograph at the
level of the T5-T6 intervertebral disk) cHL of any subtype; had completed 6 cycles of ABVD successfully at
MSKCC (and not at an external facility); received a staging PET scan before treatment; and underwent interim
or posttreatment PET restaging and appropriate followup (24 months posttreatment or until evidence of
treatment failure). Pediatric patients or any patients
demonstrating CD20-positive cHL (who will likely
benefit from rituximab-based therapy14 and have been
managed separately at MSKCC15), composite lymphoma,
multiple malignancies, human immunodeficiency virus
infection, or refractory disease during 6 cycles of ABVD
were excluded (Fig. 1).
Nuclear Imaging

All scans were performed on PET/CT cameras, including
Discovery LS, Discovery ST, and Discovery STE (all
manufactured by GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wis) or
Biograph LSO-16 (Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern,
PA), without preference. Patients fasted for 6 hours before
undergoing an 18-FDG PET/CT scan; the liberal intake
of water was encouraged. Blood glucose was measured at
the time of arrival with an institutional cutoff of 200 mg/
dL. Approximately 12 to 15 millicuries (mCi) of 18-FDG

was injected intravenously. During the subsequent uptake
period of 60 to 90 minutes, patients also drank diluted
oral contrast medium (diatrizoate meglumine, 2.5% solution, 1000 mL; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY)
while resting quietly in a reclined chair. Low-dose CT
(120-140 kilovolt, 80 milliampere) and PET emission
images were obtained from the base of the skull to the
middle of the thigh. All PET, CT, and fusion images were
reviewed on a workstation integrated with a picture
archiving and communication system (Volume Viewer 2,
AW Suite, version 2.0; GE Healthcare) that allowed multiplanar image reformatting.
All PET scans were reviewed by MSKCC boardcertified nuclear medicine personnel before management
decisions were made. Each PET scan was reevaluated for
the current study by 2 nuclear medicine physicians (H.S.
and R.C.L.). Patients were required to have received a
pretreatment PET scan (from any institution) to act as a
baseline for future studies (to assess 18F-FDG avidity of
disease) and for that pretreatment PET scan to have
abnormal 18-FDG uptake that was indicative of disease.
On-treatment and end-of-treatment scans were performed at MSKCC or a local imaging facility that followed the MSKCC PET scanning protocol, thereby
minimizing test variability. Patients who received only
gallium scans were excluded.
Clinical Data

Using the DAVInCI search results, the medical records of
all eligible patients were accessed to ascertain their

presenting signs and symptoms, pathology, staging, laboratory values, chemotherapy regimen, follow-up (including imaging) and clinical outcome. This retrospective
review was approved by the Institutional Review Board;
patient consent was not required. Patient characteristics
are outlined in Table 1.
Staging

At the time of presentation to MSKCC, all patients
received a workup including history and physical examination, blood tests, biopsy review, and CT and PET scans
if not already completed at a prior institution. All outside
pathologic and radiologic information was submitted and
reviewed by MSKCC physicians before treatment planning. All patients were staged according to the Cotswolds
modification of the Ann Arbor staging system.16
Treatment

All eligible patients received ABVD according to MSKCC
guidelines (Fig. 2). Doses of chemotherapy were as follows: doxorubicin at a dose of 25 mg/m2, bleomycin at a
dose of 10 units/m2, vinblastine at a dose of 6 mg/m2, and
dacarbazine at a dose of 375 mg/m2 administered intravenously on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for a total of 6
cycles. Dose modifications, discontinuance of bleomycin,
and growth factor support were as per MSKCC
guidelines.
Follow-Up Imaging

All patients were placed on surveillance and imaged, after
treatment, in accordance with standard MSKCC and
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
guidance, using chest radiographs and CT (1 per year)
(Fig. 3). Further imaging (outside of and in addition to
this guidance, including CT and PET scans) was
requested on an individual basis and in accordance with
clinical need.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

A total of 337 patients were identified as having received
treatment with the ABVD regimen at MSKCC; 47
patients were eligible for the study. Patients were deemed
ineligible because of 1) advanced stage of disease, 2)
planned consolidative radiotherapy or other treatment, 3)
incomplete imaging/medical records, 4) bulky disease, 5)
pediatric cases and inadequate follow-up, 6) other medical
conditions or recurrent disease after undergoing primary
irradiation, or 7) CD20-positive cHL (Fig. 1).
The majority of patients were female (35 patients)
and young, with a median age of 28 years (range, 17
years-65 years). Forty-four patients were aged < 45 years.

Nodular sclerosing subtype was the predominant histology (41 patients), with 2 patients presenting with mixed
cellularity and 1 with lymphocyte-rich disease. The histologic subtype in 3 patients was unspecified. A majority of
the patients (34 patients) were staged as having IIA disease, 6 patients were staged as having IA disease, 6 patients
were staged as having IIB disease, and 1 patient was staged
as having IIEA disease (lung). The majority of patients
presented with favorable disease as per NCCN guidelines
(34 patients with 1 NCCN risk factor). Ten patients
had >3 lymph node sites and 1 patient had extranodal
1206

All patients had abnormal 18-FDG uptake noted on
their pretreatment PET scans. Interim restaging was performed after cycle 4B in the majority of patients (40
patients): 39 patients underwent PET scans and 8 patients
underwent CT scans only (Table 2). Thirty-eight of the
39 interim PET scans were negative and 1 scan was positive (biopsy-proven sarcoidosis). All 8 patients who
underwent interim CT scanning demonstrated a significant response to chemotherapy with either no evidence of,
or a marked reduction in, adenopathy.
Posttreatment imaging (either PET or CT) took
place approximately 4 weeks (median, 2.71 weeks; range,
1 week-12 weeks) after treatment with ABVD. Thirtythree patients had post-ABVD PET scans and 14 underwent CT after a negative interim PET scan (Table 2); 32
of 33 PET scans were negative and 1 was positive (biopsyproven sarcoid). All 14 patients who underwent CT scans
after therapy with ABVD demonstrated either no evidence of disease or stable/shrinking lymph nodes in areas
of prior PET-negative disease. One patient had significant
thymic hyperplasia. The patient with a previously positive
interim PET scan because of sarcoidosis was found to
have stable mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Both patients who developed disease recurrence

after ABVD therapy had negative interim PET scans and
a negative posttreatment PET or CT.
Follow-Up

Patients were monitored for 24 months after postABVD restaging (median: 5 months; range, 24 months95 months) and underwent radiographic surveillance with
chest radiographs and/or CT scans according to standard
MSKCC practice and NCCN guidelines (Fig. 3).
Disease Recurrences

Two patients developed disease recurrence after
treatment. One patient developed disease recurrence at 7
months with progressive lymphadenopathy in previous
and new sites of disease, all of which were detected on
follow-up CT. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy
and the patient was asymptomatic with normal blood
work. For the second patient, disease recurrence was
confirmed at 24 months after presentation with neck
lymphadenopathy, dysphagia, and fatigue. There were
no B symptoms and blood work was normal. Concurrent
surveillance CT and a subsequent PET scan confirmed
enlarging, 18-FDG–avid lymphadenopathy. Although a
surveillance scan conducted 6 months prior had demonstrated enlarging lymphadenopathy, a subsequent PET
scan was interpreted as negative by an outside institution. Retrospective image review by MSKCC staff,
performed as part of the current analysis, revealed
abnormal 18-FDG uptake in lymph nodes in the upper
mediastinum, which increased on follow-up scan
6 months later.
Remissions: Further Imaging

Twenty-one patients underwent further imaging/
evaluation in addition to the standard MSKCC routine
surveillance imaging protocol. Reasons included:

•

Five patients underwent additional PET follow-up to
confirm continued CR.
Sixteen patients had abnormal routine surveillance imaging or symptoms that required further evaluation. The
majority resolved with observation or antibiotics. Three
patients had thymic rebound (identified on surveillance
imaging 5 months-7 months after therapy with ABVD
and resolving 24 months-58 months after ABVD) and 3
had sarcoidosis (2 of which were diagnosed during treatment with ABVD and 1 of which was diagnosed after
treatment during surveillance follow-up).

The remaining 24 patients had an uncomplicated
follow-up. All 45 patients remained in CR at the time of
last follow-up.

DISCUSSION
The objective of the current study was to examine whether
radiologic surveillance during follow-up in patients with
early-stage, nonbulky, CD20-negative cHL who are
treated with ABVD alone may be unnecessary because of
effective therapy, a predicted low risk of disease recurrence, and low recurrence detection rates with standard
imaging. In keeping with the literature, the findings of the
current study demonstrate that 45 of the 47 eligible
patients achieved durable CRs after ABVD alone. These
results reinforce the excellent outcomes with combination
chemotherapy reported in other, albeit larger, clinical
studies.2-4,17,18 We also excluded patients with bulky
disease, CD20-positive cHL, and refractory cHL during
ABVD therapy from this analysis, thus improving the
expectation of a good outcome (Fig. 1).
The standard of care for patients with early-stage,
nonbulky cHL has generally been CMT (ABVD plus
involved-field radiotherapy) with either 2 or 4 chemotherapy cycles depending on clinical features and initial
response. The majority of centers in Europe and the
United States have opted for CMT based on randomized
trials.5,19-22 At MSKCC, 6 cycles of ABVD alone has
been a treatment option for all appropriate patients with
early-stage, nonbulky cHL since our 2004 study comparing ABVD with ABVD plus extended field radiotherapy,
which indicated no significant differences in freedom
from disease progression.2 Other studies have supported
the role of chemotherapy alone in the treatment of
patients with early-stage cHL and most recently, reported
a survival advantage for this treatment strategy when compared with CMT.3,4,17,18
The cHL recurrence rate ranges from 10% to 15%
in its early stages.23 Recurrence is most likely to occur in
original or new, adjacent sites,24 with the highest risk of
disease recurrence existing in the first year. In the current
series, the median follow-up was 55 months (range, 24
months-95 months), and thus was sufficient to capture
disease recurrences occurring after therapy with ABVD.
The identification of recurrences during posttherapeutic
surveillance is important but evidence to support imaging
as the key intervention is poor. Patterns of disease recurrence suggest that imaging may be of limited value 2 years
after therapy.25 Radford et al demonstrated that the
majority of disease recurrences (81%) were identified by
the patient, with only 2 cases identified from an abnormal
radiograph.9 This has been corroborated by a Canadian
study that found 71% of recurrences in patients with HL
were identified by the patient.7 It has also been stated that
follow-up imaging contributes to earlier disease detection
1207

Original Article

in only 2% of patients.12 These findings have been echoed
in subsequent studies.8,10,11 Of the 2 patients who developed disease recurrence in the current study, 1 was identified via scheduled imaging and the other was
simultaneously identified by the patient and scheduled
imaging. It is difficult to determine whether the first case
of disease recurrence would have been identified by the
patient or on examination, but research suggests that the
method of detecting recurrence may have little impact on
progression-free or overall survival.7,26
The US NCCN guidelines for HL recommend
imaging on an annual or biannual basis for the first 2 to
5 years of follow-up.27 The 2010 American College of
Radiology appropriateness criteria for follow-up also
recommends CT imaging for the first 5 years.28 The
objective benefit to the patient of surveillance imaging
appears to be limited. Although patients can be reassured
by a negative imaging scan, they can equally suffer undue
distress waiting for results and undergo invasive
procedures after a false-positive result. Research has
found CT scans to be of little benefit to patients,29,30
with hypothetical cost-benefit analyses demonstrating
CT follow-up to be of minimal survival benefit for
patients with all stages of disease and to be associated
with a reduction in quality-adjusted life expectancy for
those with early-stage disease.29 There are also legitimate
concerns regarding the unregulated and cumulative ionizing radiation exposure, particularly in the younger population.7 Nevertheless, it would be understandable if some
patients felt a degree of anxiety if they underwent only observation with no surveillance imaging performed at all.
In the current series, 21 patients received further
workup and/or imaging (in addition to ‘‘standard’’
MSKCC imaging surveillance practice) because of concerns. At the time of last follow-up, none had developed
disease recurrence. Unfortunately, objective assessment of
imaging after therapy is compounded by uncertainty
regarding residual mediastinal masses, which can represent thymic ‘‘rebound’’/hyperplasia; necrotic tissue; or
active, refractory disease. Therefore, patients are referred
for further imaging or biopsy to rule out disease. In the
current series, thymic hyperplasia/rebound, sarcoidosis,
infection, or a reactive process was found to be largely
responsible for abnormal imaging/lymphadenopathy and
3 patients underwent a biopsy to rule out disease
recurrence. However, the results of the current study can
provide reassurance that in this specific patient population, unusual 18F-FDG avidity, lymphadenopathy, or
symptoms are unlikely to represent a case of disease
recurrence.
1208

Although it is recognized that interim 18-FDG and
end-of-therapy PET scans can provide prognostic information in patients with cHL,31,32, surveillance patterns
vary. Moreover, early disease recurrence within the setting
of a negative interim PET scan has been reported.33 However, the pretest probability for disease recurrence in
patients with nonbulky cHL is low, and we and others34
have shown that the incidence of recurrence in patients
with early-stage nonbulky cHL after a negative posttreatment PET scan is very low. Therefore, in those patients
with early-stage, nonbulky cHL, PET scanning could
assist clinicians in delineating those who require intensive
radiologic surveillance and those who do not. The results
of the current study, in conjunction with the growing concerns about radiation from medical imaging, suggest that
surveillance imaging in this subset of patients treated with
ABVD alone could be ceased altogether.
The results of the current retrospective study indicate that a PET-detected CR noted in patients with earlystage, nonbulky, CD20-negative cHL who are treated
with ABVD alone (excluding patients who develop refractory disease during therapy) is predictive of a low risk of
disease recurrence and that follow-up imaging studies
appear unnecessary. This strategy will reduce cumulative
radiation exposure and health care costs in a predominantly young patient population.
