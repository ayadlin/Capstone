patients were more likely to have chemotherapy initiated in their patients. The
authors developed a conceptual model of the process pathway experienced by
patients with stage III colon cancer to demonstrate areas of potential underuse
of chemotherapy. Nearly half of patients with stage III chemotherapy in the US
do not receive chemotherapy. Although many patients are too old or frail to benefit appropriately, for many patients chemotherapy is simply not initiated. Attention needs to be focused on systematic approaches to prevent systems failures
that result in underuse. Guidelines regarding chemotherapy use in elderly
patients are especially important. Cancer 2008;113:3279–89.  2008 American

arcinoma of the colon and rectum is the second leading cause
of cancer-related mortality in the US. In 2007, an estimated
150,000 individuals will have been diagnosed with the disease
and 52,000 will have died of causes related to colon and rectal
cancer.1
For colon cancer, the primary treatment is surgical, and the
need for adjuvant therapy depends largely on the extent of the disease as determined at the time of surgical resection. The National
Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus guidelines published in 1990
advocated the use of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for
patients with stage III colon cancer.2 More recent findings have confirmed the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a 6-month regimen of 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in improving rates of
disease recurrence (by 34%) and overall survival (by 24%).3,4 Over

the last 20 years, significant advances have been
made in the efficacy of chemotherapeutics and more
therapeutic options are available, but the core
recommendations are unchanged. Recent professional recommendations from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network maintain the same practice
guidelines initially coalesced by the NIH in 1990.5
Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that a
significant proportion of patients with stage III colon
cancer do not receive standard adjuvant therapy.6,7
In this study, we sought to systematically review
existing knowledge regarding the use of chemotherapy for patients with stage III colon cancer in the
community. Our specific objectives were to 1) obtain
an estimate of the rates of adjuvant therapy use
across different populations, 2) catalog the factors
that are associated with use, and 3) identify directions in which health services research may be directed to improve appropriate use of adjuvant therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A systematic search strategy was constructed to identify existing literature. Broadly, we sought reports of
the rates at which patients with stage III colon cancer receive postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Only studies analyzing the use of chemotherapy in
patients diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in the
US were included for review. At a minimum, studies
needed to define 1) a cohort of patients (including
sample size) with stage III colon cancer based on
established cancer staging practices, 2) the population from which the cohort was identified, and 3) the
proportion of patients in the cohort that either
received or was offered chemotherapy. In an initial
review, we found several analyses of the rates at
which patients are evaluated by medical oncologists,
which is a subtly different endpoint. To augment
understanding of potential barriers to care, we
allowed our search strategy to encompass analyses
using this auxiliary endpoint. The results of these
analyses are reported separately.
We included only studies analyzing the care of
patients treated since the publication of the 1990
NIH consensus guidelines. Studies that did not differentiate between colon and rectal cancer were
excluded whenever this lack of distinction precluded
the assessment of chemotherapy use for patients
with stage III colon cancer (separate from stage II or
III rectal cancer). If possible, data present in studies
were used to calculate rates of standard adjuvant
therapy, even when it was not explicitly reported. For

example, to report rates of chemotherapy use in
patients aged 75 years, we combined patient counts
from groups of patients ages 75 to 79 years, 80 to 84
years, and 85 years. Studies in which the cohort of
interest was developed based on survey response
were excluded. Investigations published in letter or
abstract form were not included.

Search Method
A comprehensive literature search was performed to
identify any relevant publications. This search was
comprised of a 3-staged approach. First, we deployed
a keyword search strategy with the search terms
(‘‘colonic neoplasms’’ OR ‘‘colorectal neoplasms’’ OR
‘‘antineoplastic agents/therapeutic use’’ AND ’’chemotherapy, adjuvant’’ OR ‘‘combined modality therapy’’
OR ‘‘colonic neoplasms/therapy’’ OR ‘‘colorectal neoplasms/therapy’’). This search strategy was applied
to the PubMed database, with limits including English language studies, human studies, and studies
published since 1990 (4468 unique references). Of
these 4468 references, we identified 15 studies that
met our inclusion criteria. Second, the bibliographies
of each of these 15 studies were collected and combined into a single list of references. This yielded 98
studies, of which 1 additional study met inclusion
criteria. Third, using Web of Science, we performed a
reverse literature search to identify studies that had
cited any of the 16 studies identified in the previous
2 search strategies. This final step yielded 340 studies, and 5 additional studies meeting our inclusion
criteria. Our search therefore yielded a total of 22
publications. We used PubMed/MEDLINE and library
resources to access abstracts and, when necessary,
the full text of any study that was published in 1990
or later. Searches were performed during the week of
September 24 through September 28, 2007.
Analytic Methods
We used a systematic review method instead of a
meta-analytic approach because of the heterogeneity
of the existing literature. Many of the studies we analyzed used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results-Medicare (SEER-Medicare) data source.
These studies varied somewhat in terms of the time
periods of analysis, and with regard to the details of
their multivariate models and inclusion/exclusion
criteria, but several studies used the same source
data. Meta-analytic methods would be inappropriate
in the context of these overlapping analyses. In addition to analyzing rates of adjuvant therapy use, we
gathered information regarding patient, provider, and
environmental factors that are associated with use.
We only reported those factors that were analyzed

Chemotherapy for Stage III Colon Cancer/Etzioni et al

within the context of a multivariate model predicting
use of chemotherapy. Studies in which analyses did
not distinguish between stage III colon cancer and
stage II or III rectal cancer were excluded. We did
not specifically analyze the type or duration of chemotherapy administered because this was not reported
in the majority of studies analyzed.

RESULTS
Studies Reviewed
Of the 22 studies that met our criteria, 20 were population-based6-25 and 2 were hospital-based.26,27 The
majority of the population-based studies used data
from either SEER9-13,15,16,18-23 or the National Cancer
Database6,14; 6 other studies used specific regional
cancer registries as the basis for identifying a study
cohort.7,8,17,24,25,27 Many of these studies analyzed
overlapping populations of patients, especially the
studies based on SEER-Medicare datasets. We did
not, therefore, calculate the overall size of the cohort
of patients considered in the studies we reviewed.
Study Methodology
The quality of the 22 studies was generally good,
with the endpoint of interest clearly stated in each.
In most of the studies, the stated endpoint was
defined as the initiation of any adjuvant chemotherapeutic regimen. For 3 of the 22 studies, the outcome
variable of interest was defined as whether chemotherapy was offered, recommended, refused, or
administered.19,24,27 Population inclusion and exclusion criteria were clearly defined within each study.
Several of the studies conducted multivariate analyses on populations that included patients with either
colon or rectal cancer.8,10,19 To minimize heterogeneity, these studies were not included in our review of
predictors of chemotherapy use. However, each of
these studies did report absolute rates of chemotherapy use in patients with stage III colon cancer, and
these results were included for analysis.
The statistical techniques used within these studies were appropriate. None of the 11 studies reporting multivariate analyses was based on data sources
with stratified sampling methods and therefore
weighted analytic techniques (eg, SUDAAN) were not
used.7,9,13,15-17,21,22,24-27 With the exception of 2 studies, each of the studies used multivariate logistic
regression for significance testing. One study used
Poisson regression,15 and another used a hierarchical
generalized linear regression model to analyze the
nested effects of patient and surgeon characteristics.16

3281

The hypotheses driving each of the 11 studies
were not always clearly defined. In 6 of these studies,
the specific aims of the studies were primarily exploratory, seeking to analyze a broad range of factors
that might be associated with rates of chemotherapy
use9,17,22,24,25,27 The remaining 5 studies were targeted more at specific testable hypotheses.7,13,15,16,21

Overall Results
The rates of chemotherapy use varied from 39% to
71% (Table 1).6-27 A total of 12 multivariate analyses
were present in 11 different studies. Of these 12 analyses, 10 examined receipt (initiation) of chemotherapy as the outcome of interest7,9,13,15,17,21,22,24,25,27
and 2 examined evaluation by a medical oncologist
as the designated outcome.15,16 The results of these
different multivariate analyses are summarized in
Tables 2 and 3.
Patient Characteristics
Age
In the studies we reviewed, older patients received
adjuvant chemotherapy significantly less often than
younger patients. Unadjusted rates for patients aged
65 to 75 years ranged from 70% to 76% but dropped
sharply in older age groups, to 8% to 10% in patients
aged 85 years.11,18,21-23 Within the reviewed literature, age was modeled both as a categoric variable9,16,21,22,24,25 and as a continuous variable7,15,27 in
multivariate analyses. In each of these models,
advanced age was found to be a significant predictor
of failure to be evaluated by medical oncologists
and/or failure to initiate chemotherapy.
Sex
Ten studies analyzed the role of sex in predicting the
receipt of chemotherapy, and 3 of these studies
reported statistically significant findings.7,15,17 Mahoney et al, using a single-institution study (n 5 69
patients), found women were less likely to receive
adjuvant treatment than men (adjusted odds ratio of
5.8) based on a statistical model that adjusted only
for age.17 In a larger study using California Cancer
Registry data and hospital discharge records (n 5
13,231 patients), McGory et al found male patients
were more likely to receive chemotherapy than
females (adjusted odds ratio of 1.11).7 Luo et al
found that women with stage III colon cancer were
slightly more likely than men (adjusted relative risk
of 1.042) to be evaluated by a medical oncologist.15
Race/ethnicity
Potential racial/ethnic disparities in the use of chemotherapy were investigated in most of the studies we

reviewed. Of 9 studies that analyzed race using multivariate models, 7 found some evidence of disparity.
When present, disparity was present when comparing black, African-American, or nonwhite patients
with white patients.9,15,16,21,22,25,27 The most focused
of these studies was published by Baldwin et al in
2005, who found that among patients ages 66 to 70
years, black patients received chemotherapy at a rate
that was slightly less than that of white patients
(adjusted relative risk of 0.88).9 Their model adjusted
for a broad range of patient factors, social factors,
and environmental factors and still found a statistically significant effect based on race. Two studies
found race/ethnicity to be nonpredictive of the use
of chemotherapy.7,25 McGory et al examined a large

cohort of patients (n 5 13,231 patients), but did not
control for as diverse a range of environmental factors (eg, characteristics of the treating oncologist and
hospital).7 Wu et al used a variable classification that
categorized race and sex into 4 categories (white
males, white females, black males, and black
females), with nonsignificant results.25

Marital status
In 3 studies, married patients demonstrated higher
rates of chemotherapy use than nonmarried patients.
Studies analyzing rates of evaluation by oncologists15,16 and initiation of chemotherapy9,15 found
marital status to be a significant predictor of chemotherapy use. The impact of marital status on chemo-

therapy use was small, however, with an adjusted
relative risk of 1.16 (for married vs unmarried
patients) in the largest of these studies.15

Comorbidity
The effect of comorbidity on the likelihood of receiving chemotherapy was analyzed in 9 studies.7,9,13,15,16,21,22,25,27 The majority of studies
modeled comorbidity based on the Charlson system,
stratifying patients into 3 or 4 levels based on historical diagnoses. Seven of these 9 studies found increasing comorbidity to be predictive of a lower likelihood
of receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.7,9,13,15,16,21,22
The 2 studies that did not find a correlation were
likely limited by small sample size.25,27 The magnitude of the effect of comorbidity was large. For the
most comorbid patients (Charlson level 21 or 31),
the odds ratios (relative to a Charlson level of 0) for

receiving chemotherapy were 0.39 in the analysis of
the California Cancer Registry by McGory et al7 and
0.38 to 0.44 in SEER-Medicare data.21,22
Each of the 9 studies controlled for age, but
none investigated an interaction term between age
and comorbidity. Length of inpatient hospitalization
after surgical resection and postoperative rehospitalization were found to be negative predictors of the
use of chemotherapy.9 A recent study by Gross et al
found that specific chronic illnesses (congestive
heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes) were associated with a
decreased likelihood of initiating adjuvant chemotherapy.13 Of these specific comorbidities, congestive heart failure was the most powerful negative
predictor for initiating chemotherapy, with an
adjusted odds ratio of 0.49, compared with 0.81 and
0.83, respectively, for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and diabetes.

§State insurance was used as a proxy measure for low income in this study.

Socioeconomic status
The impact of socioeconomic status (SES) on the use
of chemotherapy was examined in 7 studies.7,9,15,16,21,24,25 Each of these studies was based on
cancer registry data, linked either to Medicare or
hospital discharge data. SES variables were constructed by linking to a median income within a
patient’s census tract, and stratified either by quartile, as poverty versus nonpoverty area (if 20% of
residences were below the poverty level), or as a percentage of patients in the census tract living below
200% of the poverty level. Three studies found disparities based on these constructed variables,7,16,24
whereas other authors found no significant impact of
SES on the use of chemotherapy.9,15,21,25 The magnitude of the effect of SES was quite small in the study
by McGory et al (adjusted odds ratio of 0.991 for likelihood of receiving chemotherapy among patients living below 200% poverty threshold),7 but was much
larger in the study by VanEenwyk et al (adjusted odds
ratio of 2.3 for failure to receive adjuvant treatment
among patients in the lowest income quartile).24 One
study used enrollment in state insurance plans as a
proxy for low income, and found enrollees to be less
likely to be evaluated by oncologists (adjusted odds
ratio of 1.54 for those not on state insurance plans).16
Tumor Characteristics
Number of positive lymph nodes
Four studies found that patients with more positive
lymph nodes had a greater overall use of chemotherapy.15,16,21,22 These studies found a higher rate of

evaluation by oncologists as well as the more frequent initiation of chemotherapy among patients
with a higher number of positive lymph nodes.

Tumor grade/size
Only 1 study, by Luo et al, analyzed tumor grade,
and this study found it to be a nonsignificant predictor of evaluation by an oncologist.15 Tropman et al
investigated whether tumor size (stratified as >3 or
<3 cm) was predictive of the use of chemotherapy.27
In their analysis, which controlled for no other
tumor-related factors (except for stage III colon cancer as an inclusion criteria), tumor size was not
found to be a significant predictor.

Provider Characteristics
Surgeon
Luo et al analyzed variations in the use of chemotherapy related to the patient’s surgeon.16 They found
that 20% of the variation in rates of evaluation could
be attributed to the surgeon, and that patients treated by surgeons who had graduated more recently,
higher volume surgeons, and those practicing within
a major teaching hospital were more likely to be
evaluated for chemotherapy. This study did not estimate the magnitude of this effect.
Oncologist
The role of the oncologist in driving chemotherapy
use was analyzed in 1 study by Baldwin et al.9 In their
study, they found that patients treated by oncologists

Chemotherapy for Stage III Colon Cancer/Etzioni et al

3285

who had been in practice for a longer period (>10
years), oncologists with a higher annual volume of
consultations for colon/rectal cancer, and oncologists
who practiced in the hospital in which the surgical
resection took place were all more likely to receive
chemotherapy. Other factors related to the medical
oncologist, including board certification in internal
medicine and whether the medical oncologist admits
patients to the hospital in which the surgical resection was performed, were both found to be nonpredictive of the use of chemotherapy.

Hospital
Hospital factors were analyzed in 3 of the studies we
reviewed.9,16,25 Baldwin et al found that patients treated at teaching hospitals were less likely to receive
chemotherapy (adjusted odds ratio of 0.77).9 In contrast, Luo et al found that patients treated by surgeons affiliated with a teaching hospital were more
likely to be evaluated by an oncologist (adjusted
odds ratio of 1.3).16 Wu et al found that patients treated in hospitals with cancer programs approved by
the American College of Surgeons’ Commission on
Cancer were more likely to receive chemotherapy
(adjusted odds ratio of 2.0).25
Insurance coverage
Half of the studies reviewed were based on SEERMedicare data, and in these studies insurance coverage was homogenous. The type of insurance was
specifically analyzed in 3 studies, each of which was
based on state cancer registries with information
regarding insurance coverage obtained through a
linkage to hospital discharge data.7,24,25 McGory
et al7 found a lower use of chemotherapy in patients
covered by Medicaid or private plans compared with
patients covered by Medicare (adjusted odds ratio of
0.65), whereas VanEenwynk et al24 found higher rates
of use in patients covered by private plans (adjusted
odds ratio of 2.2). Wu et al noted no significant differences between patients with public insurance or
who were uninsured versus those with private insurance.25
Year of Diagnosis
Five studies used multivariate techniques to determine whether chemotherapy use increased over time
since the introduction of the NIH consensus guidelines.7,15,21,22,27 In 3 of these studies, SEER-Medicare
data were used to analyze patients diagnosed
between 1992 and 1999, and in each of these analyses chemotherapy use was found to be more frequent in more recent years.15,21,22 Luo et al
investigated temporal trends in the rates at which

oncologists, and found evaluation to be more likely
to occur in the more recent years of their study period.15 McGory et al used California Cancer Registry
data, and stratified the year of diagnosis into 1997
through 2001 versus 1994 through 1996.7 Based on
this demarcation, they found no significant difference in receipt of chemotherapy. Tropman et al, with
a sample size of 80 patients, found the use of chemotherapy to be no different in 1996 compared with
1991.27 Several other studies analyzed temporal
trends in the use of chemotherapy without multivariate analysis.6,10,19 Based on data from the National
Cancer Data Base, Jessup et al noted an increase in
chemotherapy use from 39% in 1990 to 64% in
2002.6 Potosky et al19 and Cronin et al10 reported
improvements across 3 time periods (1991, 1995, and
2000) using data from a SEER patterns of care study,
although they did not specifically state the magnitude of these changes. Unadjusted rates of use for all
studies reporting rates of chemotherapy are displayed in a bubble plot shown in Figure 1 (Fig. 1).

FIGURE 2. Conceptual model of the pathway of adjuvant care experienced
by patients with stage III colon cancer. As a first step, referral for oncologic
evaluation is initiated. This referral then needs to be accepted/kept by the
patient. Next, consultation with a medical oncologist occurs. If chemotherapy
is deemed appropriate, is then initiated. Finally, the chemotherapy regimen
itself needs to be maintained until therapy is complete.

SEER area (Detroit) had a higher rate of medical oncology evaluation compared with the majority of
other SEER areas.15 The magnitude of this regional
effect is difficult to interpret because the Detroit
region was the reference group in the multivariate
analysis.

DISCUSSION
Our review found that the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage III colon cancer has
been well-studied. We identified 22 studies analyzing
the care provided to different populations of patients,
and estimated that rates of chemotherapy use vary
from 39% to 71%, with the most recent reports showing rates of 48% to 62%. Within these studies, 12
separate multivariate analyses were performed, identifying a broad range of factors that are at least
somewhat responsible for variations and significant
rates of nonuse.
The appropriate use of adjuvant therapy is the
end result of a process pathway involving multiple
steps. Luo et al proposed a 2-step pathway consisting
of 1) referral to medical oncology followed by 2) use
(or nonuse) of chemotherapy.16 Based on our analysis, we sought to expand on this model in a way that
would add structure to future efforts aimed at
improving the rates of appropriate use of adjuvant
therapy (Fig. 2).
In the model proposed by Luo et al, the first step
in the pathway for the adjuvant treatment of a
patient with stage III colon cancer is consultation
with a medical oncologist.16 It is important to realize,
however, that this first step encompasses 2 distinct
processes of patient care: the initiation of a referral
and the propensity of a patient to accept and follow
through with an evaluation. Our review found evidence that problems may exist in both of these pro-

cesses. Mahoney et al17 examined a population of 35
patients with stage III colon cancer who did not
receive chemotherapy. For 12 of these patients (34%),
they found no evidence that chemotherapy was
offered or discussed. They also found that 11 patients
(31%) either refused a referral or failed to follow up
with an appointment.17 In a similar study, Wu et al
found that of 101 patients who did not receive chemotherapy, nearly 40% had no identifiable reason.25
Using a SEER-Medicare dataset, Luo et al examined
whether the surgeon plays a role in determining
whether patients are evaluated by an oncologist.16
They found that surgeons bear responsibility for
approximately 20% of the variations in whether
patients are seen by a medical oncologist. Taken together, these studies hint at what is potentially significant underuse.
Despite these issues, the vast majority of patients
with stage III colon cancer undergo oncologic evaluation (Table 2). Based on SEER-Medicare data,
Baldwin et al and Luo et al found that 78% to 82% of
patients with stage III colon cancer are evaluated by
medical oncologists.9,15,16 However, such an evaluation is not a guarantee that a patient with stage III
colon cancer will receive standard adjuvant therapy,
because these same studies reported that 27% to
31% of patients evaluated by an oncologist did not
receive chemotherapy.9,15 To our knowledge, the
most important study examining reasons for the
nonuse of standard adjuvant therapy was conducted
by Ayanian et al using data from the California Cancer Registry.8 In this study, provider surveys were
used to identify the reasons why adjuvant chemotherapy was not offered to eligible patients with colorectal cancer. Patient refusal accounted for 29.6% of
nonuse, comorbid illness for 21.6%, and advanced
age for 11.4%. The most illuminating finding from
this study, however, was that for 14.8% of patients,
‘no reason’ was listed, and ‘not clinically indicated’
was the reason given for another 21.6% of cases of
nonuse. Similar research into the care of patients
with breast cancer has shown that 32% of cases of
failure to use appropriate adjuvant therapy have no
definable reason other than system failure.28
The last step in the process pathway for patients
with stage III colon cancer is the continuation and
completion of adjuvant treatment. Although this was
not a focus of the current review, 2 recent analyses
used SEER-Medicare data to analyze the duration of
adjuvant therapy received by patients with stage III
colon cancer. These studies found that 22% to 31%
of patients were unable to complete a course of
treatment, and that the mortality rate was 20% to
47% lower among patients who completed therapy

Chemotherapy for Stage III Colon Cancer/Etzioni et al

versus those who were unable. In addition to age
and frailty, no clear reasons for these failures could
be determined.11,18
In summary, our conceptual model categorizes 4
specific processes within which patients are at risk
for failing to receive appropriate adjuvant therapy: 1)
referral to an oncologist, 2) acceptance and follow
through with evaluation, 3) oncologic consultation/
evaluation, and 4) the ability of patients to maintain
a regimen of chemotherapy. We have found evidence
pointing to issues regarding the nonuse of standard
adjuvant therapy related to each of these processes.
In what directions should efforts be made to address
these shortcomings?
Quality assurance efforts need to be aimed at
identifying and promoting key process measures. On
several fronts, this is already happening. The American College of Surgeons has worked through its own
Commission on Cancer to develop quality-of-care
measures for breast and colorectal cancer, and these
measures were endorsed by the National Quality Forum in April 2007. One of these measures is that
postoperative chemotherapy be considered or administered within 4 months of diagnosis in patients
aged <80 years with colon cancer that involves regional lymph nodes. In a similar vein, the Medicare
Quality Improvement Community, through its Physician’s Quality Reporting Initiative, is advocating a
quality measure, namely the proportion of patients
with stage III colon cancer who were ages 18 to 80
years and were prescribed chemotherapy. These
efforts, although important, need to be expanded in
a way that improves their usefulness. Simply knowing that a patient did not receive adjuvant therapy
does not necessarily indicate substandard care. Our
model classifies failure to receive appropriate adjuvant therapy into 1 of several domains. Patient factors, such as noncompliance and refusal of care,
could have a dramatic impact on rates of evaluation
by oncologists and the use of chemotherapy. Similarly, a patient who is evaluated for adjuvant chemotherapy and documented as refusing care may
actually have received inadequate communication
regarding the role of therapy. The next generation of
quality indicators should evolve to consider these
possibilities, and report them in a way that enables
targeted efforts at quality improvement.
Process-oriented approaches to assessing patterns of treatment are clearly important, but attention also needs to be paid to environmental
conditions that foster evidence-based quality of care.
Environments in which surgeons, oncologists, and
other physicians work collaboratively are intuitively
more likely to result in an improved quality of care.

The existing literature has touched on this concept.
Two of the studies we reviewed analyzed whether
patients treated in teaching hospitals were more
likely to be evaluated by a medical oncologist, and
these studies yielded conflicting results.9,16 Baldwin
et al found that patients treated at teaching hospitals
were less likely to initiate chemotherapy, whereas
Luo et al found that patients treated by surgeons
affiliated with a teaching hospital were more likely to
be evaluated by an oncologist.9,16 Wu et al found that
treatment in a hospital approved by the American
College of Surgeons’ Commission on Cancer was
associated with a greater use of chemotherapy.25 Collaborative models for the delivery of care have great
appeal, but have not yet achieved their potential.
Furthermore, although a multidisciplinary model of
care may be an important step, it is unlikely that all
patients with colon cancer will be cared for in these
types of systems. Alternative approaches should be
investigated, with an eye toward empowering hospitals, cancer registries, and payor systems to assist in
coordinating services. Research should also be directed toward those barriers faced by patients to identify and address problems with access to care. To our
knowledge, relatively little is known regarding the
impact of financial, personal, and pragmatic (eg,
transportation, scheduling) considerations on uptake
of care. One novel approach is to identify dedicated
‘navigators’ to advocate for patients during their cancer treatment program.29,30 These types of systems
have the potential to significantly improve the quality of care delivered to all patients, especially to vulnerable populations and those with cultural/
language barriers.
Finally, focused attention should be directed toward fostering evidence-based standards of care
regarding the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in elderly patients. A significant body of research suggests
that chemotherapy is well-tolerated and efficacious
in an elderly patient population.4,31-36 Undoubtedly,
there are patients who are poor candidates for adjuvant therapy, either because of frailty or comorbidity.
Of the 22 articles we reviewed, none included an
assessment of functional status, and this is a significant shortcoming of the research in this area. In considering the appropriateness of chemotherapy,
physicians are asked to weigh factors related to age,
comorbidity, and functional status. The extent to
which these factors determine the relative risks and
benefits of adjuvant therapy needs to be examined
closely. Advances in chemotherapy medications,
especially the introduction of oral chemotherapeutics, make ongoing research in this area even more
important.

Nearly 20 years have passed since the publication of the 1990 NIH consensus guidelines. Although
much has changed, much has remained the same.
Approximately 40% of patients with stage III colon
cancer fail to receive standard adjuvant therapy, even
though the weight of evidence strongly supports its
use. Earlier work by Hodgson et al reviewed the
knowledge base regarding the relation between provider factors and a broad range of treatment-related
processes and outcomes.37 They found significant
variations in terms of the patterns of treatment
experienced by patients with colorectal cancer. In the
current study, we chose to focus on 1 specific process of care-the receipt of chemotherapy for stage III
colon cancer-and found significant problems in
terms of its uniform use for eligible patients. Despite
the impressive amount of research performed on this
topic to date, there is still significant room for
improvement in assuring that patients with colon
cancer receive appropriate adjuvant therapy.
