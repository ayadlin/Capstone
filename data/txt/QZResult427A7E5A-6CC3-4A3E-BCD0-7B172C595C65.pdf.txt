Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Trisomy for chromosome 7 is frequently observed as an initiating event in sporadic colorectal
cancer. Although unstable chromosome numbers and recurrent aneuploidies drive a large fraction
of human cancers, targeted therapies selective to pre-neoplastic trisomic cells are non-existent. We
have previously characterized a trisomy 7 cell line (1CT + 7) spontaneously derived from normal
diploid human colonic epithelial cells that aberrantly expresses the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR, chromosome 7p11). Recent studies identified AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside) as a pharmacological inhibitor of aneuploid murine fibroblast
proliferation. Here, we report that AICAR induces profound cytostatic and metabolic effects on
1CT + 7 cells, but not on their isogenic diploid counterpart. Dose–response experiments indicate
that 1CT + 7 cells are fourfold preferentially sensitive to AICAR compared to diploid cells.
Unexpectedly, treatment of 1CT + 7 cells with AICAR led to a reversible 3.5-fold reduction (P =
0.0025) in EGFR overexpression. AICAR-induced depletion of EGFR protein can be abrogated
through inhibition of the proteasome with MG132. AICAR also heavily promoted EGFR
ubiquitination in cell-based immunoprecipitation assays, suggesting enhanced degradation of
EGFR protein mediated by the proteasome. Moreover, treatment with AICAR reduced EGFR
protein levels in a panel of human colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in xenograft tumors in vivo.
Our data collectively support the pharmacological compound AICAR as a novel inhibitor of
EGFR protein abundance and as a potential anticancer agent for aneuploidy-driven colorectal
cancer.

tumorigenic stages. Aneuploidy arises when chromosomes fail to segregate properly during
mitotic cell division.1 Although there is debate as to whether aneuploidy drives or merely
serves as a consequence of cancer progression,2 targeting cells with an inappropriate number
of chromosomes may be a practical chemopreventive or therapeutic approach.3,4 Tumors
typically acquire non-random gains, losses or translocations of chromosomes that may
permit selective benefits that are currently not well understood.5 One of the most common
and recurrent cytogenetic alterations in sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) is the appearance
of trisomy for chromosome 7, detected in approximately 40% of early-staged adenomas and
increases with disease progression.6,7 Although aneuploidy has been extensively studied in
yeast and some mammalian cells, selective therapies targeting cells with such chromosomal
abnormalities have only recently been explored.8

We have previously described the spontaneous generation of a trisomy 7 cell line (1CT + 7)
derived from originally diploid (46,XY karyotype) human colonic epithelial cells (HCEC
1CT).9 The HCEC 1CT line, which is stably diploid when propagated in 2% serum,
originated from non-malignant tissue of a previous CRC patient undergoing routine
colonoscopy and immortalized with ectopic expression of CDK4 and hTERT.10 Under
defined, serum-free culture conditions, HCECs with the acquisition of a third copy of
chromosome 7 emerged from the diploid 1CT line, thus representing an isogenic model to
examine the effects of trisomy 7 in vitro. Such isogenic cell lines can serve as useful cellular
reagents to identify antigrowth or apoptosis-inducing compounds specific to aneuploid
human cells. Interestingly, 1CT + 7 HCECs (along with trisomy 7 cells derived from
breast,11 brain12 and esophageal13 tissue) aberrantly overexpresses the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR),9 conveniently located on chromosome 7p11.
EGFR, a membrane-localized receptor tyrosine kinase, becomes activated in the presence of
EGF ligands14 and promotes cell proliferation through a cascade of signal-transduction
events. Upon ligand binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor, autophosphorylation
of C-terminal tyrosine residues (Y1173) initiates EGFR activation and internalization
through endocytosis. These events lead to the recycling of receptors back to the cell surface
for re-use or receptor degradation by the ubiquitin– proteasome and/or ubiquitin–lysosomal
pathways.15–18 As many types of human cancers display overexpression19 or mutations in
the EGFR gene, a number of antibody-based therapies targeting EGFR are currently utilized
for therapeutic purposes.20 For example, the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab is used in the
treatment of metastatic colorectal and head/neck cancers. We have previously shown that
cetuximab (trade name Erbitux) is more effective at inhibiting HCEC 1CT+7 proliferation
compared to karyotypically normal cells, suggesting that cells with trisomy 7 also acquire an
increased dependency on EGFR signaling.9

The adenoside analog compound AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-Dribofuranoside) has recently been found to elicit a selective apoptotic response in trisomic
mouse embryonic fibroblasts and CIN-driven CRC lines,21 as well as anti-growth responses
in EGFR-vIII-mutated glioblastoma cells.22 Immunocompromised mice treated daily with
AICAR also displayed reduced xenograft tumor volume using a variety of karyotypically
abnormal human cancer cell lines.21 The canonical effects of AICAR include a cellular
energy stress response that induces AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation
(T172) by the kinase LKB1 and subsequent inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).
AMPK and ACC phosphorylation halts cell proliferation through inhibition of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.23 For these reasons, AICAR has been
extensively studied as a potential anticancer drug.
In this study, we tested the effects of AICAR on the growth of diploid versus trisomic
HCECs. We found that AICAR is selectively and potently cytostatic towards 1CT + 7 cells,

but largely ineffective against diploid 1CT cells. Surprisingly, treatment of 1CT + 7 cells
dramatically reduced EGFR overexpression and inhibited proliferation in an EGF-dependent
manner. We propose that AICAR accelerates ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of
EGFR in 1CT + 7 cells through an AMPK phosphorylation-independent mechanism.
AICAR-mediated depletion of EGFR proteins is further confirmed in vitro with a panel of
human CRC cells as well as in xenograft tumor models in vivo. Taken together, the
anticancer properties of AICAR may be potentially beneficial as a chemopreventive agent to
patients predisposed to sporadic CRC through the proliferative inhibition of trisomy 7 cells.

Results
AICAR induces selective cytostatic and metabolic effects on HCEC 1CT + 7

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Previous studies indicate that mouse embryonic fibroblasts harboring one additional
chromosome are more sensitive to apoptosis induced by AICAR exposure compared to
diploid mouse embryonic fibroblasts.21 To determine whether 1CT (diploid) or 1CT + 7
(trisomy 7) HCECs are preferentially sensitive to treatment with AICAR, cells were cultured
in increasing concentrations of AICAR for 5 days. This dose–response experiment revealed
a fourfold lower EC50 value for 1CT + 7 cells compared to 1CT (0.225 and 1.026 mM,
respectively) (Figure 1a). The growth inhibitory potency of 0.25 mM AICAR was further
evaluated over a 6-day period by collecting sequential cell counts every 3 days after
treatment. We found that AICAR completely prevented the proliferation of 1CT + 7, but not
1CT cells, compared to vehicle control (Figure 1b). This block in cell cycling could be
attributed to an increase in the S-phase arrest in asynchronous cells (Supplementary Figure
S1). Treatment with AICAR did not induce apoptosis, as all cells remain attached to the
culture plate. When cells were plated at clonal density, AICAR completely and potently
abolished the clonogenic potential of 1CT + 7 cells compared to 1CT cells (Figures 1c and
d).
As the metabolic effects of AICAR on mammalian cells have previously been
investigated,24 we next inquired whether AICAR can selectively perturb critical metabolic
processes in either of the HCEC lines. 1CT and 1CT + 7 cells were treated with vehicle or
AICAR-containing medium for 48 h and cell culture supernatants were collected for
analysis. We found that treatment with AICAR selectively decreased both the consumption
of glucose (Figure 2a) and the production of lactate (Figure 2b) in 1CT + 7 cells, whereas no
significant effects were observed in diploid cells. Furthermore, 1CT + 7 cells have a
noticeably higher basal rate of both metabolic processes compared to diploid cells, similar to
observations published elsewhere.25

AICAR negatively regulates EGFR protein levels in 1CT + 7 HCECs As 1CT + 7 cells
express high levels of EGFR compared to 1CT cells, we tested whether the mechanism by
which AICAR inhibits 1CT + 7 proliferation could be mediated through EGFR. Both 1CT
and 1CT + 7 cells were treated for 24 h with 0.25 mM AICAR and whole cell lysates were
probed for EGFR by western blot analyses. Surprisingly, we show that AICAR treatment led
to a 3.5-fold decrease in 1CT + 7 EGFR levels, but had only marginal effects on diploid 1CT
cells (Figures 3a and b). Phosphorylation of well-known AICAR targets, such as AMPK
(Supplementary Figure S2), ACC and mTOR (Figure 3a), were negligible between control
and compound-treated cells (with slight increases in ACC phosphorylation in the presence
of AICAR). To determine whether LKB1, the kinase responsible for AMPK activation
during energy stress, is required for EGFR depletion, 1CT + 7 cells were transfected with
control or LKB1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) for 3 days to deplete endogenous LKB1
levels. siRNA-transfected 1CT + 7 cells were then treated with vehicle or AICAR for 24 h
and whole-cell lysates were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). We show that AICAR-induced EGFR depletion is

independent of LKB1, as knockdown of LKB1 has no effect on EGFR levels regulated by
AICAR treatment (Supplementary Figure S3). In addition, treatment with AICAR for a
short-term period (30 min) also did not alter EGFR levels in HCECs (Supplementary Figure
S4), suggesting that AICAR does not facilitate rapid EGFR turnover through ligandindependent receptor activation. The depletion of EGFR proteins is further verified by
immunofluourescent staining on AICAR-treated 1CT + 7 cells (Figure 3c).
To determine whether depletion of EGFR by AICAR is a permanent or transient effect,
HCECs were treated with AICAR for 24 h, washed and replaced with serum- and AICARfree culture medium for the indicated time points. The 24 h release of cells from AICAR
resulted in the restoration of EGFR expression (Figure 3d) by western blot analysis. AICAR
also did not affect c-MET protein levels; another chromosome 7-located receptor tyrosine
kinase overexpressed in 1CT + 7 cells. These results support EGFR specificity rather than a
global repression of receptor tyrosine kinases.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To establish whether AICAR reduces EGFR at the transcriptional level, we examined
steady-state EGFR mRNA transcripts by semiquantitative reverse transcription–polymerase
chain reaction. Total RNA isolated from cells treated with AICAR was reverse transcribed
and the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain was detected by polymerase chain reaction. EGFR
transcripts were unaltered in both cell types following treatment with AICAR
(Supplementary Figure S5), suggesting a regulation at the protein level.
AICAR treatment induces ligand-dependent EGFR degradation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We subsequently asked whether the availability of EGF ligands is required for AICARinduced EGFR depletion in 1CT + 7 cells. To determine if the presence of EGF is necessary
for this mechanism of action, we measured EGFR protein levels in 1CT + 7 cells treated
with AICAR with and without 20 ng/ml EGF. Culturing cells in the absence of EGF
abolished EGFR depletion induced by AICAR, indicating a requirement for EGF ligand and
most likely EGFR activation/turnover (Figure 4a). Ligand stimulation is known to induce
EGFR internalization, followed by either receptor recycling or degradation.26 To establish
whether AICAR can induce EGFR degradation due to ligand stimulation, we conducted a
time-point experiment in which EGF-starved 1CT + 7 cells were stimulated with EGF ligand
to follow receptor degradation kinetics. In Figure 4b, we show that 48 h EGF-starved 1CT +
7 cells treated with vehicle induced only a slight degree of EGFR degradation due to EGF
stimulation for the indicated time points. However, EGF-starved 1CT + 7 cells treated with
AICAR for 24 h before ligand stimulation provoked rapid and potent EGFR degradation
(Figure 4b). These results suggest that AICAR treatment leads to accelerated EGFR
degradation in a ligand-dependent manner in contrast to receptor recycling back to the cell
surface.
We next examined whether AICAR treatment led to an increase in proteasomal-mediated
degradation of EGFR protein. 1CT + 7 cells were pre-treated with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 (10 μM) for 1 h before 24-h AICAR treatment and collection of lysates at the
indicated time points. MG132 pre-treatment resulted in a rescue of EGFR levels (Figure 4c),
suggesting that AICAR-induced EGFR depletion may be, at least partially, attributed to an
increase in protein degradation by the proteasome (at a time frame between 12 and 24 h
post-treatment). Although the majority of EGFR proteins is stabilized because of
proteasome inhibition in the presence of AICAR, the slight decrease in EGFR levels
following 24-h AICAR exposure in MG132-treated 1CT + 7 cells may be attributed to the
contributions by the lysosomal degradative pathway. To determine if AICAR enhances
ubiquitination of EGFR, we performed an ubiquitination assay in 24-h AICAR-treated 1CT
+ 7 cells transiently expressing hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged ubiquitin. MG132 was
used to prevent EGFR degradation and lysates were immunoprecipitated with an EGFR

agarose-conjugated antibody. We observed a considerable increase in EGFR ubiquitination
(most likely polyubiquitination as indicated by an HA-positive smear) following AICAR
treatment (Figure 4d).
Next, HCECs were cultured with increasing concentrations of EGF to determine if AICAR
can prevent growth stimulated by EGF ligands. Our data indicate that AICAR selectively
inhibits EGF-induced proliferation in 1CT + 7 cells (Figure 4e), but not in diploid 1CT cells.
These results demonstrate that EGF ligands contribute to the specific antiproliferative effects
of AICAR on aneuploid human cells. Treatment of 1CT cells with 10 ng/ml EGF induced an
approximate 2.6-fold growth response compared to a 4.3-fold increase in 1CT + 7 cells.
However, 1CT + 7 cells treated with AICAR resulted in only a 2.5-fold increase in
proliferation, reducing EGF-induced growth rates closer to those of diploid cells.
Comparably, knockdown of EGFR in 1CT + 7 cells with siRNAs causes a growth inhibitory
effect similar to AICAR treatment (data not shown).
Downregulation of EGFR by AICAR in human CRC cells in vitro and in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if AICAR-induced depletion of EGFR is specific towards HCECs, we treated
a panel of CIN and microsatellite unstable (MIN) human CRC cell lines with increasing
concentrations of AICAR for 36 h. A dose-dependent downregulation of EGFR upon
treatment with AICAR was observed (Figure 5a) in five out of six cancer cell lines tested.
This effect also appears to be independent of CIN (SW480, HT29) versus MIN (HCT116,
LoVo, DLD-1) status as EGFR downregulation was observed in cancer cells of both genetic
backgrounds, although similar results were not detected in the pseudodiploid cell line
HCT15. As shown previously,21 AICAR effectively reduces tumor volume in mouse
xenograft models using CRC cell lines compared to mice treated with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) control. Daily intraperitoneal injection of AICAR for 18 days reduces
xenograft tumor volume by roughly 33 and 45% compared to vehicle-treated mice using the
CRC cell lines LoVo and HT29, respectively.21 These tumors were then harvested, fixed
and histologically sectioned for EGFR analysis by immunohistochemistry. In agreement
with our in vitro data, AICAR treatment reduced the intensity of EGFR staining in xenograft
tumors in vivo compared to control-injected animals (Figure 5b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It is important to note that most MIN cell lines also display some degree of aneuploidy,
amplifications and/or chromosomal rearrangements.27 As the sensitivity of cell lines to
AICAR does not appear to strongly correlate with EGFR expression levels or modal number
of chromosomes per cell (Supplementary Figure S6), further studies are required to more
carefully evaluate the mechanisms involved in AICAR sensitivity and EGFR regulation. As
reported previously21 and in this study, the increased sensitivity of non-transformed mouse
and human cells to AICAR appears to correlate with an additional gain of a single
chromosome (trisomic, 2n + 1), whereas cancer cells represent a plethora of chromosomal
abnormalities and other genetic alterations. Nonetheless, these data serve as initial
observations in the use of AICAR as a chemopreventive or therapeutic agent against trisomy
7 cells through EGFR downregulation and perhaps in combination with AMPK activation.

Discussion
The discovery of aneuploid-specific compounds for the treatment of CIN-driven cancers is
reliant on useful models to recapitulate the aneuploid state. We have employed an isogenic
HCEC line that is distinctive at the karyotypic level: normal diploid versus trisomy 7
derived from identical cell populations. In this study, we provide data supporting AICAR as
a prospective chemopreventive compound and further reveal for the first time that EGFR is
a major target of AICAR in a trisomic, yet otherwise normal, non-malignant human

epithelial cell line. Whether or not AICAR may be an effective therapeutic agent against
EGFR-driven cancers (for example, lung cancers) remains unknown.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Under optimal growth conditions, aneuploidy has been shown to be detrimental to cellular
fitness in terms of proliferation rates compared to diploid cells.25,28 Evidence suggests that
aneuploid cells develop an intrinsic stress response, independent of the alteration to a
specific chromosome, which may assist them in thriving under selective pressures.29 One
hypothesis to explain impaired proliferation is that additional chromosomes generate excess
proteins30 that in turn induce proteotoxic stress.28 These proteomic changes could therefore
lead to compensatory genetic alterations in protein degradation pathways (for example, the
ubiquitin–proteasome pathway) to counteract the effects of imbalanced protein levels. In
budding yeast, aneuploid strains develop mutations in the deubiquitinating enzyme UBP6 to
compensate for the increased intracellular protein composition and this alteration is
sufficient to improve their proliferation.31 In this work, it is plausible that AICAR treatment
may also be attenuating similar protein degradation pathways to revert overexpressed
proteins generated by extra chromosomes to either normal or low levels that would
otherwise provide proliferative cues (for example, EGFR).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Figure 6 illustrates our current working model on the mechanism behind AICAR-induced
growth inhibition. We have previously reported an enhanced dependency of 1CT + 7 cells
on EGFR signaling compared to diploid cells.9 In the proposed schematic, EGF-ligandinduced receptor activation and internalization is required for the intracellular activity of
AICAR. Upon ligand binding and receptor sorting by endosomes, we hypothesize that
AICAR indirectly accelerates EGFR ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis. This reduces
the recycling of receptors back to the cell surface and therefore diminishes sensitivity to
EGF ligand. Further biochemical analysis is required to elucidate the exact mechanism of
action and to uncover any unidentified pathways that may be involved in these events. It is
also currently unclear the extent of which the lysosomal degradative pathway contributes to
AICAR-mediated downregulation of EGFR.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As trisomy 7 is found in a large fraction of premalignant lesions and in the vast majority of
human colorectal carcinomas, we hypothesized that 1CT cells cultured under defined,
serumdepleted conditions acquired a third copy of chromosome 7 and upregulated EGFR
levels, supporting a clonal expansion of ‘EGFR-addicted’ 1CT + 7 cells. Therefore, a more
potent cytostatic effect is observed when inhibiting EGFR in oncogene-addicted cells32 (that
is, the effect of cetuximab on 1CT + 7 cells compared to 1CT). Interestingly, ectopic
overexpression of EGFR in both normal human bronchial epithelial cells33 or in HCEC 1CT
is insufficient to sensitize cells to AICAR (Supplementary Figure S7). These results suggest
that AICAR is more effective against EGFR-dependent cells and/or perhaps those that
endogenously overexpress EGFR.
Cells typically respond to AICAR through phosphorylation and subsequent activation of
AMPK, the best-known target of AICAR.34 Although Tang et al.21 provided evidence of an
AMPK-dependent cytostatic effect in aneuploid mouse embryonic fibroblasts, they did not
observe similar specificity when activating AMPK through an alternative method, such as
treatment with the compound metformin, an indirect AMPK activator. We also observed
that metformin did not specifically sensitize 1CT + 7 cells (Supplementary Figure S8a),
suggesting that the specificity of AICAR may be independent of AMPK function.
Furthermore, both HCEC lines were similarly responsive to mTOR repressionmediated
growth inhibition using the compound Torin1 (Supplementary Figure S8b), indicating that
the sensitivity of trisomy 7 cells to AICAR is also not regulated through the canonical
mTOR pathway. EGFR degradation induced by AICAR could be either dependent on
AMPK (treatment with AICAR leads to AMPK activation by LKB1 leading to EGFR

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 April 11.

depletion) or independent of AMPK (treatment with AICAR affects another pathway that
leads to EGFR depletion). Although we have no direct experimental evidence whether the
effects of AICAR on EGFR are dependent on AMPK, we hypothesize that AMPK, like
LKB1, is not required for EGFR degradation as T172 activation of AMPK is dependent on
LKB1.35 Because AMPK activation requires LKB1 and our data indicate that LKB1 is not
required for EGFR degradation (Supplementary Figure S3), these results altogether suggest
that AICAR-induced EGFR depletion is independent of AMPK activation. Although
activation of AMPK may play a large role in reducing cell proliferation induced by AICAR
in some cells, our data indicate that EGFR depletion may be an alternative mechanism of
growth inhibition. AMPK activation and targeted proteolysis of EGFR could also be
working collectively to reduce the growth of aneuploid cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our findings describe AICAR as a novel compound in regulating EGFR protein levels in
both non-malignant and malignant genomically unstable cells, a potential therapeutic
strategy in the chemoprevention of aneuploidy-driven CRC. AICAR selectively inhibits
proliferation of 1CT + 7 HCECs, whereas diploid cells are largely unaffected. Furthermore,
these effects are reversible (Figure 3c) and EGFR levels are restored upon 24-h washout.
These results indicate that AICAR may be effective in treating patients with colonic
adenomas driven by aneuploidy with minimal toxicity to normal epithelial tissue. As the
human colon constantly undergoes rapid turnover, AICAR may be used to prevent the
spontaneous growth of aneuploid cells until they are shedded at the apex of the colonic
crypt.36 Upon turnover-mediated abolishment of aneuploid cells from the colonic
epithelium, AICAR treatment may be discontinued and EGFR levels will presumably be
restored in normal tissue. Also worth noting is that AICAR efficacy is dependent on the
presence of EGF ligand, thus only affecting cycling cells in a mitogen-containing
environment.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To conclude, we have identified AICAR as a novel regulator of EGFR signaling that
potently prevents proliferation of a minimally aneuploid (trisomy 7) HCEC line. The
downregulation of EGFR protein levels can be attributed to increased ubiquitination and
proteasomal-mediated degradation in an EGF-dependent manner. We propose that this
negative regulation of EGFR (in possible combination with AMPK activation) inhibits the
growth of both malignant and non-malignant human colonic cells with unstable
chromosome numbers. Future studies involve testing the effects of AICAR on a diverse set
of aneuploid cancer cell lines, further elucidating the mechanism of preferential sensitivity
to cells with genomic instability, and to determine critical pathways involved in AICARmediated EGFR regulation. Further analyses on a broad panel of aneuploid, non-transformed
human cell lines are also unquestionably needed, although the field is currently limited by
the lack of these cell-based models. Therefore, the development of new aneuploid systems
using human cells or mouse models is of utmost importance towards therapeutic discovery
in exploiting the aneuploid state for clinical benefit. This study provides further rationale for
the potential clinical utility of AICAR as a chemopreventive compound to patients
predisposed or recurring from sporadic CRC or as a therapeutic agent to those currently
diagnosed with CRC.

experiments are performed in serum-free, defined conditions in the presence of EGF, unless
otherwise stated. Human CRC cell lines are cultured with 10% serum. The identity of all cell
lines were verified by DNA fingerprinting.
AICAR (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, ON, Canada), metformin (Sigma, St Louis,
MO, USA) and MG132 (Torcris Biosciences, Bristol, UK) were dissolved in
dimethylsulfoxide. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction primers for EGFRtyrosine kinase domains were previously described elsewhere.9 siGENOME siRNAs
targeting LKB1 or non-targeting controls were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO,
USA) and reverse transfections were performed using RNAiMAX transfection reagent
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) under the manufacturer's instructions.
Growth assays
Cells (2 × 103) were seeded in 96-well clear-bottom plates in serum-free medium for 24 h
before the addition of vehicle or drug-containing medium. At 5 days post-drug treatment,
CellTiter-Glo (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) reagent is added to each well as per the
manufacturer's instructions and shaken. Luminescent ATP levels were detected by an
Envision plate reader (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and cell numbers are normalized
to control wells.

For colony formation assays, cells were plated at clonal density (200–400 cells per 10cm2
dish) in 2% cosmic calf serum to promote low-density cell adhesion to plates. After 24 h,
cells were washed with PBS and replaced with either vehicle or 0.25 mM AICAR in serumfree medium. At 15 days post-treatment, colonies were washed with PBS and stained with
6% glutaraldehyde/0.5% crystal violet solution for 30 min and counted.
Metabolic analysis
HCECs were seeded in six-well dishes at various densities (1–5 × 103 cells) in 2 ml serumfree medium and replaced with 1 ml vehicle or AICAR-containing medium 24 h later. Cell
culture supernatants were collected 48 h post-treatment and centrifuged to exclude debris.
Supernatants were analyzed using a BioProfile Basic-4 Automated Analyzer (Nova
Biomedical, Waltham, MA, USA) and values were normalized to cell-free medium
incubated alongside drug-treated cells. Glucose consumption and lactate production is then
normalized to the relative sum of total cell counts per hour over a 48-h treatment period.

Whole cell lysates were collected in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled. Equal amount of
lysates were resolved on 4–15% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Membranes were then probed with the following
primary antibodies: anti-EGFR (sc-03; Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-Met
(L41G3; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-RalA (610221; BD Biosciences), antiLKB1 (27D10; Cell Signaling) and anti-HA (C29F4; Cell Signaling). Anti-phospho-AMPK,
phospho-ACC and phospho-mTOR are from the AMPK and ACC sampler kit (9957; Cell

antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) were detected by
SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate kit (Thermo Scientific) and imaged
on a G:Box (Syngene, Frederick, MD, USA) gel documentation system. Bands were
quantified using the GeneTools (Syngene) software and normalized to loading controls.
Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry
For immunofluorescence, cells cultured in chamberslides were fixed in 4%

diluted 1:50 in blocking solution and applied for 1 h, followed by goat-anti-rabbit
fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary for 1 h. Cells were then stained for 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole, mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), and observed at

Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5-μm paraffin-embedded sections of Bouin-fixed
HT29 and LoVo xenografted tumors following heat-induced antigen retrieval with 0.01 M

immunocompromised mice was previously described elsewhere.21 Anti-EGFR primary

HCEC 1CT + 7 (106) were reversed transfected with 1μg HA-tagged ubiquitin plasmid
using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions in 2% serum medium. The next day, cells were washed with
PBS and replaced with serum-free medium containing 0.25 mM AICAR and 10μM MG132.
After 24 h, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, collected in IP buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM
NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween-20, protease/phosphatase inhibitors) and lysed for 30 min at
4°C, followed by passage through a 27.5 G needle. Lysates were then immunoprecipitated
with EGFR agaroseconjugated antibody (sc120AC; Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 4°C, followed by
three washes. Samples were then boiled in the presence of SDS and resolved by 4–15%
SDS–PAGE. Membranes were probed using anti-EGFR and anti-HA antibodies.

AICAR accelerates ubiquitination and ligand-dependent degradation of EGFR. (a) 1CT + 7
cells were treated with AICAR in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml EGF for 24 h and
lysates were analyzed by SDS–PAGE. In the absence of EGF ligand, AICAR has no effect
on EGFR protein levels. (b) EGF-starved 1CT + 7 cells were treated with AICAR for 24 h,
followed by 20 ng/ml EGF stimulation for the indicated time points. AICAR accelerates
ligand-induced receptor degradation compared to vehicle-treated cells. (c) 1CT + 7 cells
were incubated with 10 μM of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 1 h before AICAR
treatment for the following time points. Whole cell lysates were collected and analyzed by
SDS–PAGE and probed for EGFR. (d) 1CT + 7 cells were transfected with HA-tagged
ubiquitin and treated with 10μM MG132 and 0.25 mM AICAR for 24 h. Lysates were
subjected to immunoprecipitation with an EGFR agarose-conjugated antibody and analyzed
by SDS– PAGE. (e) HCECs were treated with AICAR in increasing EGF concentrations for
5 days and cell numbers were assessed by CTG assay. AICAR selectively prevents EGFinduced proliferation in 1CT + 7 cells. Columns represent mean ± s.e.m. (***P<0.0001, by

lines were treated with increasing doses of AICAR (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mM) for 36 h and
lysates were probed for EGFR. Bands were normalized to loading control and quantified
relative to non-treated (NT) cells. (b) Xenograft tumors were established from HT29 and
LoVo cells and mice were treated daily with PBS vehicle or AICAR for 18 days after
injection. Representative images of harvested tumor sections stained for EGFR by

Proposed model for AICAR-induced EGFR depletion and growth inhibition. In the presence
of EGF ligand, EGFR becomes autophosphorylated and internalized for sorting (endocytic
pathway not shown for purpose of clarity). Rather than recycling receptors to the cell
surface, we propose that AICAR promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR via
the proteasome, leading to subsequent growth inhibition. The increased dependency of
trisomy 7 cells on EGFR signaling may result in a differential toxicity to AICAR.
