Eritoran Suppresses Colon Cancer by Altering
a Functional Balance in Toll-like Receptors That
Bind Lipopolysaccharide
Wei-Ting Kuo1, Tsung-Chun Lee1,2, and Linda Chia-Hui Yu1

Abstract
Colorectal carcinogenesis is affected by overexpression of the
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptors CD14 and TLR4, which antagonize each other by affecting epithelial cell proliferation and
apoptosis. Eritoran is an investigational drug for sepsis treatment
that resembles the lipid A moiety of LPS and therefore acts as a
TLR4 inhibitor. In the present study, we explored the potential
therapeutic uses and mechanisms of action of eritoran in reducing
colon cancer progression. Eritoran administration via intracolonic, intragastric, or intravenous routes signiﬁcantly reduced tumor
burden in a chemically induced mouse model of colorectal
carcinoma. Decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis were
observed in mouse tumor cells after eritoran treatment. In vitro
cultures of mouse primary tumor spheroids and human cancer

cell lines displayed increased cell proliferation and cell-cycle
progression following LPS challenge. This effect was inhibited
by eritoran and by silencing CD14 or TLR4. In contrast, apoptosis
induced by eritoran was eliminated by silencing CD14 or protein
kinase Cz (PKCz) but not TLR4. Lastly, LPS and eritoran caused
hyperphosphorylation of PKCz in a CD14-dependent and TLR4independent manner. Blocking PKCz activation by a Src kinase
inhibitor and a PKCz-pseudosubstrate prevented eritoraninduced apoptosis. In summary, our work offers a preclinical
proof of concept for the exploration of eritoran as a clinical
treatment, with a mechanistic rationale to reposition this drug
to improve the management of colorectal cancer. Cancer Res; 76(16);

Introduction

plasmic signaling, resulting in the production of proinﬂammatory cytokines, such as myeloid differentiation factor (MyD88),
MAPK, and inhibitor of kB (IkB)/nuclear factor-kB (NFkB;
refs. 11, 12). Accumulating evidence suggests that LPS receptors
are involved in the dysregulation of epithelial apoptosis and
proliferation that predisposes the tissue of the colon to tumorigenesis. Previous animal studies have indicated that TLR4/
MyD88 signaling causes tumor cell hyperproliferation via pathways dependent on cyclooxygenase (COX), EGFR, and b-catenin (5, 13–15). In vitro studies have shown a direct effect of LPS
via TLR4/MD2 signaling on the stimulation of intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and a resistance to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–induced apoptosis (16–18).
Our recent study demonstrated a functional antagonism
between CD14 and TLR4 in the regulation of epithelial apoptosis and intestinal carcinogenesis (19). TLR4 counteracted
CD14-dependent epithelial apoptosis and promoted survival
in developing cancer cells (19–21).
Eritoran (E5564) is an investigational drug for the treatment of
severe sepsis that functions as a TLR4 inhibitor because of its
structural similarity to the LPS lipid A moiety, which is composed
of 6 acyl chains (22, 23). Recent advances have been made in
understanding the interaction between LPS and its receptor based
on studying the crystal structures of TLR4/MD2 complexed with
LPS or eritoran (24). It is recognized nowadays that LPS binding to
CD14 leads to ligand transfer onto the TLR4/MD2 complex,
which dimerizes to initiate downstream signaling (11, 25, 26).
However, eritoran (with only 4 acyl chains) does not induce
TLR4/MD2 complex dimerization or cytoplasmic signaling
(27). Animal studies using eritoran have demonstrated an inhibition of proinﬂammatory TLR4 signaling, improvement of

Colorectal carcinoma is characterized by unlimited cell proliferation and resistance to cell death. This is in contrast to
normal intestinal tissue, which has a balanced epithelial turnover that is maintained by crypt renewal and surface/villus
apoptosis (1, 2). The development of colon cancer has been
linked to the aberrant recognition of enteric bacterial byproducts through both myeloid and epithelial immune receptor
signaling (3, 4). The surface of the intestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to a large amount of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Upregulated expression of the LPS receptor complex, CD14/Toll-like receptor (TLR4)/MD2, has been identiﬁed
in the intestinal mucosa of animal models and patients with
inﬂammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancers (5–8).
The binding of LPS to CD14 on the lipid raft domain
activates a cascade of lipid messengers and protein kinase Cz
(PKCz) to recruit TLR4 to form a complex with CD14 (9, 10).
The transfer of LPS to TLR4/MD2 subsequently initiates cyto-

Tumor Progression by Dysregulated LPS Signaling

intestinal microcirculation, and higher survival rates in endotoxemic rodents (22, 28) and in inﬂuenza- and syncytial virus–
infected mice (29, 30). However, whether eritoran binds to CD14
and triggers CD14-mediated apoptosis in colon cancer cells
remains unclear.
The aim of our study was to investigate whether the administration of eritoran inhibits colorectal carcinoma development in
mouse models. In the current study, we explored the potential
therapeutic use of eritoran in tumor reduction and examined its
underlying anticancer mechanisms using primary mouse tumor
spheroids and human adenocarcinoma cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Animals
BALB/c mice 7 to 10 weeks of age were used in this study.
Experimental procedures were approved by the Laboratory Animal Care Committee of the National Taiwan University College of
Medicine.
Antibodies
All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology,
except otherwise stated. Primary antibodies included mouse antihuman PCNA (1:2,000), phospho (p)- and total (t)-IkB
(1:2,000), p- and t-ERK1/2 (1:4,000), p- and t-JNK (1:2,000),
p- and t-Akt (1:2,000), p-PKCz (Thr410; 1:2,000), p-PKCz
(Thr560; 1:5,000; Abcam Epitomics), t-PKCz (1:2,000), p-tyrosine (1:2,000; EMD Millipore), CD14 (1:50 for immunoﬂuorescence and 1:2,000 for Western blot; R&D Systems), TLR4 (1:100
for immunoﬂuorescence and 1:2,000 for Western blot; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), TLR2 (1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
MyD88 (1:2,000), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 1:200; Abcam),
mouse IgG1 and IgG2a isotype controls (R&D Systems), rat IgG2a
isotype controls (Abcam), and b-actin (1:10,000; Sigma; refs. 19,
31). The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse IgG
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000), and to Alexa 594
or 488 (1:1,000; ThermoFisher).
Models of chemically induced colorectal carcinoma
Mouse models of colitis-associated colorectal carcinoma
were prepared according to previously established methods
(19). Brieﬂy, mice were injected i.p. with azoxymethane (AOM;
10 mg/kg body weight; Sigma) at the beginning of the experiment (day 0). After 7 days, 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS;
MP Biomedicals) was administered via the drinking water for 4
days, and this was followed by 3 days of regular water. This
cycle of AOM/DSS was performed 3 times. Body weight was
measured every week, and the animals were sacriﬁced on day 84
for macroscopic inspection and histologic analysis. The numbers of tumors were determined macroscopically under a dissecting microscope, and the area covered by tumors was measured using an imaging software (AxioVision, Zeiss). Parafﬁnembedded tissues were used for histologic assessment and
tumor grading by a pathologist blinded to mouse treatment
groups. Four to 6 tumors per mouse and 10 mice per group
were examined.
Administration of eritoran
Eritoran tetrasodium, a TLR4 inhibitor (a kind gift from Eisai
Inc.), was administered intracolonically, intragastrically, and
intravenously after the induction of colorectal carcinoma. Colon

tumor formation was clearly observed on day 63 following the
start of the AOM/DSS protocol (19), and eritoran was given on
days 63, 70, and 77. Based on pilot studies, the intracolonic (i.c.)
dose of eritoran was 10 mg dissolved in 150 mL of PBS per bolus per
mouse. For intragastric (i.g.) administration, 500 mg of eritoran
was dissolved in 250 mL of PBS per bolus per mouse. For
intravenous (i.v.) administration, mice were injected with 5,
10, or 20 mg/kg of eritoran dissolved in 250 mL of PBS per bolus
per mouse (22, 28, 29).
Measurement of cell apoptosis
Intestinal sections were stained using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) detection kit (Merck). The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells was
calculated, normalized, and expressed per 1 mm2 from 10 tumor
sections from each group of mice. In addition, cancer cells were
homogenized, and the supernatant was measured for DNA fragmentation by using a cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche;
refs. 19, 20, 31, 32).
Primary intestinal spheroid cultures
Colonic tumors were cultured in vitro as spheroids following
previously methods (33, 34) with modiﬁcation. Brieﬂy, intestinal
fragments with tumors were incubated in a chelation buffer for 60
minutes on ice to remove most of the normal epithelial cells.
Tumor fractions were then incubated in a digestion buffer with
collagenase and dispase for 2 hours at 37 C. After counting
isolated single tumor cells, approximately 10,000 cells were
plated in 300 mL of ice-cold Matrigel (BD Biosciences; 3:1 ratio
with crypt culture medium) per well in 24-well plates. After
Matrigel polymerization, 300 mL of crypt culture medium was
overlaid. The overlaying medium was refreshed every 2 to 3 days,
and images were captured under a light microscope. Spheroids
were collected by dissolving the Matrigel with a recovery solution
(BD Biosciences).
Spheroids grown for 5 days were challenged by adding LPS
(from E. coli O26:B6; Sigma) or eritoran to the overlaying medium, and the effects this had on cell proliferation and cell death
were measured. Spheroid area was determined using imaging
software (AxioVision Rel. 4.8). Alternatively, time lapse imaging
for spheroid growth was performed using a real-time cultured cell
monitoring system (ASTEC Co.).
Cell lines
All cells were purchased from the ATCC/Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC), and STR-PCR proﬁle was
performed by BCRC. Human colon adenocarcinoma HT29
and Caco-2 cells were exposed to LPS or eritoran for 48 or
24 hours, and the effects of this exposure on cell proliferation
and cell death, respectively, were measured (20, 35). In some
experiments, cells were pretreated with inhibitors 30 minutes
prior to challenge. These inhibitors included 1 mmol/L Src
inhibitor-1 (Sigma), 20 mmol/L inhibitory PKCz-pseudosubstrate (Merck), and 120 mmol/L z-DEVD-FMK (Calbiochem).
In other settings, cells were challenged with lipoteichoic acid
(LTA), which is a TLR2 ligand (36) for 48 hours to assess
proliferation levels.
Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells were transfected
with a huCD14 plasmid (see below) prior to eritoran challenge to
analyze cell death response and signaling pathways.

Tumor Progression by Dysregulated LPS Signaling

Evaluation of cell-cycle progression
Cell cycle was assessed by using a BrdUrd incorporation and
propyl iodide assay. Brieﬂy, cells challenged with LPS or eritoran
for 48 hours were incubated with 10 mmol/L BrdUrd during the
last 2 hours at 37 C, and then ﬁxed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for
24 hours. Cells were denatured with 2N HCl and incubated with
anti-BrdUrd for 1 hour followed by secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 488. Finally, cells were incubated with propyl
iodide for 30 minutes and analyzed by a ﬂow cytometry with
FlowJo Software (Treestar). The percentage of cells in the G0–G1,
S, and G2–M phases was determined using Mod Fit LT cell cycle
analysis software (Verity Software).
siRNA-mediated knockdown
Gene silencing by siRNA was conducted before the challenge with LPS or eritoran. Spheroids were transfected with 50
nmol/L siRNA oligonucleotides from a pool of four targetspeciﬁc 20- to 25-nt siRNAs for CD14, TLR4, MyD88, PKCz,
or scrambled controls (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Life Technologies) in a serumfree basal medium for 6 hours. The basal medium was
replaced with a serum-containing complete medium for 2
days prior to the challenge. Human cell lines were transfected
with 50 nmol/L of siRNA as described above. After 24 hours,
cells were trypsinized and reseeded in culture plates for 2 days
prior to challenge (19).
Plasmid constructs and cell transfection
The expression vectors pMyc-CMV1-huTLR4 and pcDNA3huCD14 were kind gifts from Dr. Douglas T. Golenbock in the
University of Massachusetts Medical School. Cells were transfected with pMyc-CMV1-huTLR4 or pcDNA3-huCD14 plasmids
or respective plasmids for 24 hours. Cells were trypsinized and
reseeded into cell culture plates for 2 days prior to challenge with
LPS or eritoran (19).
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as the mean  SEM. Data that met
the assumptions of normality were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA followed by the Student–Newman–Keuls post-hoc
test for multiple comparisons. Signiﬁcance was established
at P < 0.05.
Detailed information on the animals, histopathologic examination and tumor grading, primary intestinal spheroid cultures,
human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, siRNA-mediated knockdown, plasmid constructs and cell transfection, RT-PCR, Western
blotting, and immunoﬂuorescent staining is provided in the

Results
Suppression of colon tumor burden by eritoran correlates with
inhibition of cell proliferation and augmentation of cell
apoptosis
A colorectal carcinoma mouse model administering three
cycles of AOM/DSS was utilized to evaluate the anticancer
effects of eritoran through i.c., i.g., and i.v. administration.
Eritoran was administered on days 63, 70, and 77 after the
ﬁrst AOM injection, and mice were sacriﬁced on day 84
(Fig. 1A). A signiﬁcant decrease in tumor cell multiplication
and tumor area were observed in mice treated with eritoran
via i.c., i.g, or i.v. routes (Fig. 1B–D). Colon tumor stages in
mice administered eritoran were less advanced and were
mostly present as low-grade dysplasia (Fig. 1E and F). The
doses used for the i.c. and i.g. routes were based on our pilot
studies, which showed no animal mortality, and the i.v.
concentrations were based on results obtained from experimental models of endotoxemia. A dose-dependent inhibitory
response in tumor growth with i.v. injection of eritoran was
observed (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Tumor cell proliferation was signiﬁcantly lower after eritoran
treatment, as measured by immunoblotting of the proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Fig. 1G). Using the TUNEL assay to
determine cell apoptosis, we observed higher numbers of TUNELpositive cells per area of cancerous tissue in mice treated with
eritoran compared with those administered the vehicle (Fig. 1H
and I).
LPS/TLR4-induced epithelial proliferation is prevented by
eritoran in primary mouse tumor spheroids
To clarify whether eritoran has a direct effect on colonic
cancer cells or an indirect effect by altering the tumor microenvironment, primary cultures of colonic tumor spheroids in
the absence of immune/myeloid cells were developed (Fig. 2A).
Transcripts of Lgr5 (a marker of stem cells), CD14, TLR4, and
MD2 were identiﬁed in colonic tumor spheroids (Fig. 2B).
Absence of CD68 (a macrophage marker) and CD3 (a T-cell
marker) was also conﬁrmed in primary cultures of tumor
spheroids (Fig. 2B).
Tumor spheroids were challenged with various concentrations
of LPS and eritoran to determine a nonapoptotic dose and to
examine parameters of cell proliferation. No signs of cell apoptosis were observed at any test dose of LPS (Fig. 2C). In contrast,
eritoran triggered cell death at a concentration of 10 to 50 mg/mL
but not at 1 mg/mL (Fig. 2C). Therefore, 1 mg/mL of LPS or eritoran
was used to assess proliferation, and 50 mg/mL was used in the cell
death experiments.
Mouse tumor spheroids treated with 1 mg/mL of LPS showed a
2-fold increase in spheroid area (Fig. 3A and B). Addition of

eritoran inhibited the increase of spheroid growth caused by LPS
challenge (Fig. 3A and B). The 48-hour time lapse imaging of
spheroid growth is shown in Supplementary Videos S1–S3. Gene
silencing of CD14 or TLR4 also diminished the LPS-induced
spheroid growth (Fig. 3B). The knockdown efﬁciency in spheroid
cultures was conﬁrmed by a decrease in protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Cell-cycle analysis by PI nuclear staining revealed that a higher
proportion of cells were in the S and G2–M phases following the
challenge with LPS but not following an eritoran challenge (Fig.
3C). The ratio of S–G2–M to G1–G0 cells was signiﬁcantly greater
in spheroids challenged with LPS compared with the ratio in
untreated controls or in the eritoran-treated group (Fig. 3D).
Similarly, increased percentage of cells in the S phase by LPS
challenge was shown by using a BrdUrd incorporation assay (Fig.
3E and F). The LPS-induced acceleration of cell-cycle progression
was prevented by the addition of eritoran (Fig. 3D and F).
Moreover, a challenge with LPS caused increased PCNA levels in
spheroid cultures. This increase was inhibited by the addition of
eritoran (Fig. 3G).
Furthermore, the activation of signaling molecules downstream of TLR4 was conﬁrmed, which demonstrates an increased
phosphorylation of MAPKs, IkBa, and Akt following LPS challenge (Fig. 3H). Addition of eritoran or gene silencing of MyD88
ablated LPS-induced TLR4 signaling and cell proliferation in
mouse tumor spheroids (Fig. 3H and I).
Eritoran-induced apoptosis is dependent on CD14/PKCz, but
not on TLR4, in mouse tumor spheroids
Primary mouse colonic tumor spheroids showing TLR4 and
CD14 expression were subjected to multiple gene knockdowns
to evaluate the molecules involved in the eritoran-induced cell
death response. Previous studies have indicated that the binding of LPS to CD14 activates a cascade of lipid messengers and
protein kinase Cz (PKCz) prior to the recruitment of TLR4 into
lipid rafts (9, 10). Single and double gene silencing of TLR4,
CD14, and/or PKCz in spheroids was speciﬁc and did not alter
any proteins other than the target molecules (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Compared with scrambled controls, the knockdown of
TLR4 or MyD88 did not affect the levels of cell death in tumor
spheroids following eritoran treatment. In contrast, the silenc-

4688 Cancer Res; 76(16) August 15, 2016

ing of CD14 or PKCz eliminated eritoran-induced cell apoptosis (Fig. 4A). Apoptotic levels in double knockdowns of TLR4/
CD14 or TLR4/PKCz were comparable with those in scrambled
controls (Fig. 4A).
PKCz is composed of a catalytic enzymatic site and an autoregulatory domain with a pseudosubstrate sequence (37, 38).
Previous studies have demonstrated that lipid messengers simultaneously induce the removal of pseudosubstrate-dependent
autoinhibition and the phosphorylation of the catalytic loop at
Thr410, which then causes Thr560 autophosphorylation (37). In
addition, Src kinase–activated Tyr428 phosphorylation may be
lipid-independent (39). Phosphorylation of Thr410/Thr560 or
Tyr428 is crucial for the complete activation of the enzymatic
domain of PKCz (37, 39). Our results demonstrated an increased
phosphorylation of PKCz at Thr410, Thr 560, and Tyr sites
following eritoran treatment in tumor spheroids, which was
attenuated by CD14, but not by TLR4 or MyD88 knockdown
(Fig. 4B).
Additional transfection experiments were conducted on
HEK293T cells (CD14- and TLR4-negative cells) to conﬁrm that
induced expression of CD14 is sufﬁcient to cause a cell death
response following eritoran challenge, in the absence of TLR4 (Fig.
4C). Moreover, increased phosphorylation of PKCz at Thr410, Thr
560, and Tyr sites after eritoran treatment was observed in the
CD14-transfected HEK cells (Fig. 4D).
Eritoran exposure inhibits LPS/TLR4-induced cell proliferation
in human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines
Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines were used to
further investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the
eritoran-induced antiproliferation and proapoptotic effects. Distinct expression patterns of LPS receptor subunits were detected in
HT29 and Caco-2 cells (Fig. 5A). The receptor expression in HT29
cells (CD14þTLR4þ) resembles that of human cancerous tissues,
whereas Caco-2 cells (CD14þTLR4) resemble normal colonocytes (6, 19, 40).
Human cell lines were challenged with a nonapoptotic dose of
LPS to examine cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression (Supplementary Fig. S3). HT29 showed a higher proportion of cells in
the S–G2–M phase following LPS challenge, whereas no changes in
cell-cycle phases were observed in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 5B and C). The

Other than TLR4, TLR2 also activates MyD88-dependent signaling pathways and increases epithelial cell proliferation (36, 41,
42). Bacterial cell wall products, such as LTA and peptidoglycan,
activate TLR2 signals upon initial binding to CD14 (43, 44).
Therefore, we also examined whether eritoran counteracts TLR2
signaling and cell proliferation in Caco-2 cells (CD14þTLR4).
Our results showed that LTA stimulation increased the proportion
of cells in the S–G2–M phase and the PCNA levels, which were
reduced by gene silencing of TLR2, MyD88, or CD14 (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). LTA-induced phosphorylations of IkB
and Akt were prevented by knockdown of TLR2, MyD88, or CD14
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). Addition of eritoran ablated the
increase of cell proliferation and downstream signaling induced

TLR4, inhibited the eritoran-induced cell death in HT29 cells (Fig.
5D). Knockdown of CD14 or PKCz eliminated the eritoraninduced cell death in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 5E). In addition, eritoran-induced phosphorylation of PKCz at Thr410, Thr 560, and
Tyr sites was diminished by knockdown of CD14 in both HT29
and Caco-2 cells (Fig. 5F and G).
Furthermore, Caco-2 cells (CD14þTLR4) pretreated with SrcI1 (a Src kinase inhibitor), PKCz-ps (a PKCz pseudosubstrate), or
z-DEVD-FMK (a caspase-3 inhibitor) displayed a reduction in
eritoran- and LPS-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6A). Inhibition of Src
kinase attenuated the phosphorylation of PKCz at Thr410,
Thr560, and Tyr sites. This suggests that Src kinase is upstream
of PKCz activation (Fig. 6B).

the activation of MAPKs, IkBa, and Akt pathways (Fig. 7),
which correlated to the reduction in tumor burden.

Discussion
Suppression of colonic tumor growth following eritoran
treatment is a combination of effects caused by a reduction
of TLR4-dependent cell proliferation and an elevation of
CD14-dependent cell apoptosis. These dual modes of action
by eritoran involve changes in the functional antagonism
between LPS receptors (CD14/TLR4) on colon cancer cells.
Our ﬁndings indicate that dysregulation of the LPS receptor
subunits is involved in tumorigenesis and that strategic manip-

ulation of the functional antagonism by eritoran exerts anticancer effects.
In the present study, eritoran (a putative TLR4 inhibitor)
signiﬁcantly reduced the tumor burden in the mouse colon.
Our results are in agreement with previous studies showing that
TLR4 is involved in colon cancer growth (5, 13–15, 45). We
concluded that the anticancer effect of eritoran in in vivo animal
models is predominantly via direct actions on tumorous epithelial cells. Nevertheless, a minor role of eritoran inhibition
on myeloid/immune cells cannot be ruled out. An elegant study
using bone marrow chimera of wild-type and TLR4-mutant
mice indicated that TLR4-dependent signaling originating from
epithelial cells plays a more dominant role than that from

Tumor Progression by Dysregulated LPS Signaling

(15). However, mucosal macrophages are involved in the
synthesis of amphiregulin (an EGFR ligand) following COX2/PGE2 activation, and hence, indirectly promoting neoplasia
(47). Taken together, epithelial TLR4 plays a key role in driving
carcinogenesis and is the dominant site for eritoran-induced
suppression in vivo.
In primary tumor spheroid studies in vitro, the proliferative
and death response caused by LPS or eritoran represented a
direct effect on epithelial cells because myeloid cells were
absent in the culture. The ﬁndings in primary spheroids and
cell lines provide evidence that TLR4/MyD88-dependent colorectal tumor proliferation can be uncoupled from immune cell
activation.
Blocking TLR4 by eritoran not only inhibited cell proliferation but also triggered apoptosis in mouse and human
colon tumor cells. Previous studies in our laboratory have
shown that, in the absence of TLR4 signaling, LPS exposure
caused epithelial cell death in a CD14-dependent manner
(19). Moreover, TLR4 overexpression counteracted epithelial
apoptosis induced by its coreceptor, CD14 (19). Other
reports have shown that LPS/TLR4-dependent NFkB activation confers resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human
colon cancer cells (18, 48), suggesting that TLR4 signaling
inhibits various types of stimuli for cell death. Signaling
molecules downstream of TLR4/MyD88, such as MAPK and
IKK/IkB/NFkB, and noncanonical Akt pathways, have been
associated with hyperproliferative, prosurvival, and antiapoptotic effects (13, 49–51). In the current study, eritoran induced
CD14/Src/PKCz-mediated cell apoptosis in primary spheroid
cultures and in human adenocarcinoma cells, and it caused
tumor regression in the mouse colon, which further supports
the hypothesis that changes in CD14/TLR4 antagonism exert
anticancer effects.
Compared with the extensively studied TLR4 pathways,
signals mediated by CD14 are not well understood. Due to
its lack of a cytoplasmic tail, the membrane-bound CD14 has
traditionally been regarded as merely a binding component for
the transfer of LPS to TLR4/MD2. Other studies indicate
that CD14 is also the binding component for bacterial cell
wall products (e.g., LTA) for subsequent transfer to TLR2mediated signals (43, 44). Similar to the ﬁndings in TLR4,
epithelial-speciﬁc deletion of TLR2 or MyD88 markedly
reduced colon tumor formation (52). In the present study, we
demonstrated that eritoran ablated MyD88 signaling and cancer cell proliferation induced by LPS and LTA. The results
suggested that eritoran suppressed tumorigenesis by inhibition
of TLR4- and TLR2-activated cell proliferation, partly through
competitive binding to CD14. Furthermore, biochemical studies have shown that LPS/CD14 binding initiates the production
of lipid messengers, such as sphingolipids and ceramide, and
the activation of PKCz prior to TLR4 recruitment to lipid rafts
(9, 10). Our results from mouse colon tumors and from human
cell lines demonstrate that eritoran is capable of binding to
CD14 and triggering PKCz activation in a TLR4-independent
manner. Moreover, Src kinase, a tyrosine kinase to phosphorylate Tyr 428 on PKCz, may also act upstream of its serine/
threonine phosphorylation sites. Our ﬁndings are in agreement
with previous reports showing that Src kinase also phosphorylates 3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1;
ref. 53), which is responsible for the phosphorylation of
Thr410/560 in PKCz. Taken together, eritoran-induced CD14

www.aacrjournals.org

activation induces tumor cell apoptosis via the Src/PKCz signaling pathways.
It is worth noting that the i.v. dose of eritoran needed to
suppress colon cancer was higher than the amount administered to endotoxemic animals to inhibit proinﬂammatory
signaling and cytokine production (22, 28). The massive loads
of enteric bacteria and LPS produced in the gut lumen
may account for this discrepancy. The basal level of LPS
(1.8 mg/mL) documented in the luminal content of rodent
intestines is much higher than the blood concentration that
has been reported to stimulate monocyte cytokine production
and septic responses (10 ng/mL). Therefore, the high dose of
i.v. eritoran needed for cancer suppression might reﬂect the
concentration necessary for effective competitive binding to
epithelial receptors in the presences of high levels of enteric
bacterial LPS.
In addition to i.v. injection, topical administration of eritoran,
either intracolonically or intragastrically, caused tumor regression
in the present study. The i.c. dose needed to achieve tumor
suppression was signiﬁcantly lower than the amount required
when it was delivered intravenously. Intracolonic application
may be beneﬁcial for limiting unwanted nonepithelial effects.
Moreover, the bioactivity of eritoran appears to withstand the
low pH and enzymatic degradation that could occur with i.g.
administration.
Eritoran, acting as a CD14 agonist and TLR4 antagonist, may
be clinically useful in blocking aggressive tumor growth and
extraintestinal metastasis. A previous study showed that the
intrasplenic injection of eritoran in nude mice inhibited liver
metastasis of colorectal cancer cells (54). Other studies in
human colorectal and esophageal cancer cell lines have indicated that eritoran blocks LPS-induced TLR4 signaling for b1
integrin– and selectin-dependent cell adhesion and that it
inhibits their migratory capability (54, 55). Furthermore, eritoran has previously been shown to inhibit monocytic inﬂammatory responses in endotoxemic rats and virus-infected mice
(22, 29, 30). The possibility that the inhibitory effect of
eritoran on inﬂammatory cytokine production may help suppress tumor malignancy cannot be ruled out. Overall, our
ﬁndings demonstrate that eritoran may serve as a novel immunotherapeutic agent for colorectal cancer, with a signiﬁcant
advantage over other treatments because of its multiple modes
of action for inducing apoptosis and for its antiproliferative
and anti-inﬂammatory effects.
In conclusion, the progression of bacterial LPS-induced
colon cancer was inhibited by eritoran treatment through dual
mechanisms involving the induction of CD14/Src/PKCz-mediated apoptosis and the blockade of TLR4-dependent proliferation. Eritoran-induced changes in the functional antagonism
of epithelial LPS receptors represent a novel therapeutic
approach for the suppression of colorectal cancer.
