Abstract
The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family
plays an important role in cell survival and proliferation,
and is implicated in oncogenesis. Overexpression of HER2 is
associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2
and has proven survival benefit for women with HER2positive early and metastatic breast cancer. Pertuzumab, another monoclonal antibody, is a HER2 dimerization inhibitor
that binds to a different epitope on HER2 than trastuzumab
and inhibits HER2 dimer formation with other HER family
members such as HER3 and HER1. We investigated the antitumor activity of these agents alone and in combination in
HER2-positive breast and non–small cell lung cancer xenografts. Our data show that the combination of trastuzumab
and pertuzumab has a strongly enhanced antitumor effect
and induces tumor regression in both xenograft models,
something that cannot be achieved by either monotherapy.
The enhanced efficacy of the combination was also observed
after tumor progression during trastuzumab monotherapy.
Near-IR fluorescence imaging experiments confirm that pertuzumab binding to tumors is not impaired by trastuzumab
pretreatment. Furthermore, we show by in vitro assay that
both trastuzumab and pertuzumab potently activate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, our data suggest
that the strongly enhanced antitumor activity is mainly due to
the differing but complementary mechanisms of action of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, namely inhibition of HER2 dimerization and prevention of p95HER2 formation. [Cancer Res

Materials and Methods

Introduction
The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family comprises HER1, HER2, HER3, and HER4. These proteins are capable of
forming heterodimers and homodimers, which activate signal
transduction pathways that regulate many cellular processes, including growth, proliferation, and survival (1). As such, the HER
proteins have been implicated in oncogenesis (2); in particular, tumors that overexpress the HER2 protein or have amplification of
the HER2 gene are associated with aggressive disease and poor
prognosis (3–6). HER2 overexpression has been identified in

numerous tumor types, including 20% to 25% of breast cancers (7–
10), 4% to 6% of non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC; refs. 3, 11),
and 20% to 24% of gastric cancers (5, 12).
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a humanized monoclonal antibody
that binds to the extracellular domain of HER2, inhibiting HER2mediated proliferation by activating antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC; refs. 13, 14), preventing formation of p95HER2
(a truncated and constitutively active form of HER2; ref. 15), blocking ligand-independent HER2 signaling (16), and inhibiting HER2mediated angiogenesis (17). Trastuzumab has a proven survival
benefit for women with HER2-positive breast cancer both in
advanced metastatic disease and in early disease when administered
for 1 year as adjuvant therapy (18–22). A number of phase II clinical
trials have also been carried out in patients with HER2-positive
NSCLC with some success, although the number of patients in these
trials has been small (23–25).
Pertuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is the first in a
new class of HER2 dimerization inhibitors that block HER2 dimerization with other HER family members, thus inhibiting the downstream signaling processes that are associated with tumor growth
and progression (26–28). Trastuzumab and pertuzumab bind to
distinct epitopes on the HER2 extracellular domain, and it has
been hypothesized that a combination of the two agents might
provide a more effective inhibition of tumor growth than either
agent alone (27, 29). Initial in vitro data suggest that this hypothesis
is correct, although in vivo data have been lacking (30). The aim of
this study was to investigate the antitumor effect of the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab in HER2-overexpressing
NSCLC (Calu-3) and breast cancer (KPL-4) xenograft models.

Cell lines and culture. Calu-3 cells were obtained from Chugai Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. KPL-4 cells were provided by Professor J. Kurebayashi
(Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan). The cells were cultured as
previously described (31).
Tumor xenografts. To initiate tumor xenografts, 5 × 106 Calu-3 cells
were injected s.c. into BALB/c nu/nu female mice and 3 × 106 KPL-4 cells
were implanted orthotopically into the right penultimate inguinal mammary fat pad of female severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) beige mice.
Tumors were allowed to establish growth (21 d for Calu-3 and 20 d for KPL4) after implantation before initiation of treatment.
Treatment of animals. Calu-3 or KPL-4 tumors (100 mm3) were treated
with trastuzumab (30 mg/kg loading dose, then 15 mg/kg weekly), pertuzumab (30 mg/kg loading dose, then 15 mg/kg weekly), or both, administered i.p. for the duration of the study. Tumor volumes and body weights
were measured twice weekly. For the acute study, advanced Calu-3 tumors
of ∼400 mm3 were treated once with trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab at a
dose of 30 mg/kg. Samples were harvested 7 d later for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blot analysis.

Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab: Enhanced Antitumor Activity
Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, protein lysates (20 μg
protein/lane) were electrophoresed on TRIS NuPage Ready-Gel (1.0 mm;
Invitrogen) for 1 h at 60 V, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond
enhanced chemiluminescence, Amersham) and incubated with a polyclonal
rabbit anti–human c-erbB2 antibody (Dako) at 1 μg/mL. HER2 protein was
detected using a labeled secondary antibody diluted at 1:5,000 (goat antirabbit POD labeled; Bio-Rad Laboratories GmbH) and Lumi-Light Western
Blotting Substrate (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). The Odyssey detection system (LI-COR Bioscience) was used for quantification.
For control of siRNA experiments (Fig. 5), 60 μg protein/lane was electrophoresed and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). Polyclonal rabbit anti-human ErbB-3 antibody (C-17, sc-285, Santa
Cruz) at 1 μg/mL and polyclonal rabbit anti-human epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) antibody (06-847, Upstate) at 1 μg/mL were used.
Anti-rabbit IgG-HRP–linked antibody (7074, Cell Signaling) was used as
secondary antibody at 1:2,000 dilution. Luminescence was detected with
Lumi-Light Western Blotting Substrate on the LumiImager Instrument
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH).

Assessment of metastases by quantification of human DNA. Genomic
DNA was isolated using the High Pure PCR Template Preparation kit (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH) and quantified using the PicoGreen Quantification kit
(Molecular Probes). Primers for human Alu repeats were synthesized by TIB
MOLBIOL GmbH and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the LightCycler System (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), as previously described (32).
Near IR fluorescence imaging in vivo. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab
were labeled with the fluorescent dye Cy5 (General Electric) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The labeling ratio was 5:1 (Cy5/antibody).
When KPL-4 tumors reached a volume of 200 mm3, mice were injected i.v.
with a single 50-μg dose of either trastuzumab-Cy5 or pertuzumab-Cy5.
Near IR fluorescence (NIRF) measurements were performed using the BonSAI Imaging System (Siemens Medizintechnik) equipped with an inhalation
mask for anesthesia. Fluorescence acquisition time was 4 s for all experiments. For the evaluation of binding competition, mice were injected i.v.
with a single dose of trastuzumab (30 mg/kg). After 48 h, Cy5-labeled trastuzumab or pertuzumab (50 μg/mouse) was injected i.v. NIRF signals were
measured as described above.

ADCC assays. Twenty-four hours before the assay, effector cells [peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)] were prepared from a healthy blood
donor by Ficoll gradient centrifugation. PBMCs were diluted to a final concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/mL in RPMI/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
cultured overnight. The following day, the target KPL-4 and Calu-3 cells
grown in RPMI/10% FBS were detached using Accutase (PAA Laboratories),
sedimented by centrifugation, and resuspended in RPMI/10% FBS at a final
concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL. Cells were labeled by adding 1 μL bis
(acetoxymethyl) 2,2: 6,2-terpyridine-6,6-dicarboxylic acid (Perkin-Elmer
LAS GmbH) per milliliter cell suspension, mixing carefully and incubating
for 25 min at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were washed thrice with 10 mL cell
culture medium and diluted to 1.0 × 105 cells/mL.
To perform the assay, 50 μL of serial dilutions of either trastuzumab or
pertuzumab was added to each well of a 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One
GmbH). To test the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, 25 μL
of each antibody were added instead. Thus, the final total concentration of
the antibody mixture was the same as in the single antibody experiments.
Fifty microliters of target cells and PBMCs were added, resulting in a
final antibody concentration that ranged from 0.4 to 50 ng/mL and
an effector/target ratio of 25:1. Controls included effector cells alone,
only target cells and effector cells, and target cells with 3% Triton X-100.
Plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°C and 5% CO2, and centrifuged at
200× g for 5 min, then 20 μL of each supernatant was transferred into
an OptiPlate-96 F (Perkin-Elmer LAS GmbH). After addition of 200 μL
Europium solution (Perkin-Elmer LAS GmbH) to each well, the plates were
incubated for 15 min on a shaker. Fluorescence was measured using the
Victor2 plate reader (Perkin-Elmer LAS GmbH) according to the Eu-TDA
protocol (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 615 nm; delay, 400 μs). The percentage of specific release was determined using the following formula: (experimental release − spontaneous release)/(maximum release − spontaneous
release) ×100.
siRNA experiments. Calu-3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) and KPL-4 cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen), both were supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were transfected according to the
DharmaFECT 2 reverse transfection protocol (Dharmacon). siRNAs for
HER3 and EGFR were purchased from Dharmacon and used at a concentration of 50 nmol/L per well. siRNAs against Eg5 and luciferase were used
as positive and negative controls, respectively.
For checking cell proliferation, 1 × 104 cells were seeded in normal
(Calu-3) or polyhema-coated (KPL-4) 96-well microtiter plates. After 4 d,
cells were incubated with CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega). Luminescence
was measured in a Tecan Reader (Tecan Deutschland GmbH). Mocktreated cells were taken as 100%.
For Western blot and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), 1 × 106 cells
were seeded in normal (Calu-3) or polyhema-coated 6-well microtiter plates.
For quantitative real-time PCR, cells were harvested at 24 h after
transfection. RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) with
on-column DNase treatment. First-Strand cDNA was produced with Transcriptor First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH).
Primers and probes were designed with the Universal Probe Library Assay

design center (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Quantitative RT-PCR was
performed using LightCycler 480 Probes Master in duplex PCR with the
recommended housekeeping genes (UPL #50 with β-actin for EGFR, UPL
#37 with hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase for HER3) on a LightCycler 480 II System (Roche Diagnostics GmbH).
Cells for Western blot analysis were harvested at 48 h after transfection.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 8.1 (SAS, Inc.) and the TUMGRO module according to Fieller
(33), and Munzel and Hothorn (34). Relative tumor growth inhibition was
calculated according to the formula (1−[(T−T0)/(C−C0)]) × 100.

Results
Antitumor Activity of Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab
Both Alone and in Combination
Trastuzumab in combination with pertuzumab has strongly
enhanced antitumor activity. We investigated the efficacy of
trastuzumab and pertuzumab in Calu-3 and KPL-4 tumor xenografts. Mice were treated with either: vehicle control, pertuzumab
or trastuzumab alone, or trastuzumab and pertuzumab in combination. In Calu-3 NSCLC xenografts, monotherapy with pertuzumab or trastuzumab was able to significantly inhibit tumor
growth, with treatment-to-control ratios (TCR) of 0.23 and 0.27, respectively. The combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab produced a dramatically enhanced antitumor activity compared with
single-agent treatments (TCR 0.05; Table 1; Fig. 1A], resulting in
tumor regression and, in 3 of 10 animals, complete tumor remission (Supplementary Fig. S1; Table 1).
Treatment of KPL-4 breast cancer xenografts with either trastuzumab or pertuzumab inhibited tumor growth with TCRs of 0.67
and 0.65, respectively. Again, combining trastuzumab and pertuzumab induced strongly enhanced antitumor activity compared with
either agent alone (TCR 0.04; Table 1; Fig. 1B], resulting in tumor
regression and, in 6 of 10 animals, complete tumor remission
(Table 1).
Combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab can inhibit
metastatic tumor spread. Genomic DNA from lung samples of
host animals with KPL-4 xenografts was analyzed by qPCR to investigate if the tumor had metastasized to the lung. Monotherapy
with either trastuzumab or pertuzumab did not prevent metastases forming in the lungs of the mice by day 43; however, no human
DNA was detected in the lungs of mice treated with the combination of both trastuzumab and pertuzumab, even at day 99, suggesting that this combination completely prevented metastatic tumor
spread to the lungs of these animals (Fig. 1C). Findings for the liver
were similar (data not shown).

Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab: Enhanced Antitumor Activity

Pertuzumab maintains antitumor activity after progression
on trastuzumab. To investigate the combination of trastuzumab
and pertuzumab after progression on trastuzumab, SCID mice
bearing KPL-4 xenograft tumors were treated with trastuzumab
(30 mg/kg loading dose followed by 15 mg/kg weekly) until progression (day 35). At this point, mice either continued treatment
with trastuzumab alone or with trastuzumab in combination with
pertuzumab. The combination of the two agents was sufficient to
inhibit tumor growth and, indeed, reduce tumor mass for a further
45 days (Fig. 1D). A similar result was obtained using the Calu-3
xenograft model: addition of pertuzumab to continued trastuzumab treatment–induced tumor shrinkage despite progressive
growth on trastuzumab single-agent treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
Trastuzumab with pertuzumab induces tumor cell loss. To
determine how trastuzumab and pertuzumab were inhibiting tumor growth, an acute study, using just one dose of either trastuzumab and pertuzumab monotherapy or combination therapy,
was performed in mice with advanced Calu-3 xenograft tumors.
Western blot analysis of HER2 protein levels in tumor lysates
showed that both trastuzumab and pertuzumab as single agents
reduced HER2 protein levels significantly (TCR, 0.48 and 0.56,
respectively). However, combination of trastuzumab with pertuzumab was clearly superior [TCR, 0.17 (confidence interval, 0.00–
0.39); Fig. 2A]. Similar protein decreases were found for HER1,
HER3, phosphoHER2, and downstream signaling components
(data not shown). A single treatment with combined trastuzumab

and pertuzumab using NIRF technology. Comparable NIRF signals were
obtained at the tumor site when KPL-4 xenograft–carrying mice were treated
with either (A) trastuzumab-Cy5 or (B) pertuzumab-Cy5. When mice were
pretreated with unlabeled trastuzumab, no tumor staining was seen with (C)
trastuzumab-Cy5, whereas (D) pertuzumab-Cy5 treatment showed similar
staining intensity to tumors not pretreated with trastuzumab.

and pertuzumab resulted in a more than additive effect on the
level of HER2 protein (Fig. 2A). IHC analysis of tumor tissue confirmed that the reduction in HER2 was due to tumor cell loss and
not downregulation of HER2 from the cell surface, as the remaining Calu-3 cells were still HER2 positive (Fig. 2B). IHC analysis also
revealed that the space generated by loss of tumor cells was partially filled by mouse stromal cells, which explains the relative loss
of HER2 protein with respect to total protein levels shown by
Western blotting (Fig. 2A).
In vivo visualization of trastuzumab and pertuzumab binding to xenograft tumors. Using NIRF optical imaging, we showed
that single-agent trastuzumab-Cy5 and pertuzumab-Cy5 were able
to bind to KPL-4 tumors in vivo with equal intensity (Fig. 3A and B,
respectively). To investigate if trastuzumab and pertuzumab could
bind simultaneously to xenograft tumors in vivo, mice were pretreated with unlabeled trastuzumab then with either trastuzumab-Cy5 or pertuzumab-Cy5. Pretreatment with unlabeled
trastuzumab inhibited trastuzumab-Cy5 NIRF, indicating receptor
saturation (Fig. 3C). Treatment with pertuzumab-Cy5 resulted in a
similar staining intensity as in tumors not pretreated with unlabeled trastuzumab (Fig. 3D), indicating that binding of pertuzumab is not impaired by trastuzumab.

ADCC assays with trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab. To
identify the mechanism of action for the strongly enhanced activity
of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, we performed in vitro ADCC
assays using human PBMCs (effector cells) and either cultured
Calu-3 or KPL-4 cells (target cells). Both trastuzumab and pertuzumab applied as single agents effectively activated ADCC against
Calu-3 (Fig. 4A) and KPL-4 cells (Fig. 4B) with equal potency. However, there was no increased ADCC efficiency observed when both
agents were used in combination.
HER1, HER2, and HER3 expression in human NSCLC and
breast cancer cell lines used for xenograft models and siRNA
downregulation of HER1 and HER3. The HER2-positive cell lines
KPL-4 and Calu-3 were analyzed for HER-family receptor expression by Western blotting. Whereas Calu-3 showed strong HER1
and moderate HER3 coexpression, KPL-4 cell lysates produced a
very strong HER3 and strong HER1 band (see Fig. 5B and D).
To confirm the HER2 status according to clinical standards, IHC
was performed on Calu-3 and KPL-4 xenograft tumors. Both Calu-3
and KPL-4 xenograft tumors were strongly positive for HER2 staining (IHC 3+ using the HercepTest scoring recommendations).
Because HER2 dimerization with either HER1 or HER3 can promote cell survival and proliferation, and act as a potential escape
mechanism from trastuzumab inhibition, we performed a knockdown of HER1 and HER3, respectively, and investigated the effect
on proliferation of Calu-3 and KPL-4 cells. Calu-3 and KPL-4 cells
were transfected with siRNAs targeting either HER1 or HER3, and
proliferation was measured. HER1 and HER3 targeting siRNAs
effectively downregulated expression of the respective mRNAs
roughly by about 60% to 80% in both cell lines (Fig. 5A and C).
Western blot data confirmed that HER1 and HER3 protein expression was effectively reduced after siRNA treatments (Fig. 5B and
D). In Calu-3 cells, HER1 siRNA treatment inhibited cell growth
by ∼30%, whereas downregulation of HER3 reduced growth only
by ∼7%, an effect that was no longer statistically significant
(Fig. 5A). Both results on Calu-3 cell growth are consistent with
the relative coexpression of HER1 and HER3 in this HER2-positive

cell line. In KPL-4 cells, HER3 expression turned out to be more
important for cell growth than HER1: whereas HER1-specific
siRNA reduced cell growth by ∼10%, HER3 siRNA treatment
entailed ∼25% growth inhibition (Fig. 5C). Again, this result is
consistent with the relative coexpression of HER1 and HER3 in
the HER2-positive cell line KPL-4.

Discussion
This study has shown that monotherapy with either trastuzumab or pertuzumab has a moderate growth inhibitory effect on
NSCLC (Calu-3) and breast (KPL-4) xenograft tumors. The combination treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab induced a
strongly enhanced antitumor activity in both Calu-3 and KPL-4
xenograft models, resulting in tumor regression and a complete inhibition of metastatic tumor spread in host animals. Moreover,
addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab therapy enhanced antitumor activity in KPL-4 and Calu-3 xenograft tumors that had progressed on trastuzumab. Reduction in the levels of HER2 protein
following treatment with trastuzumab and/or pertuzumab was
due to a loss of cells expressing HER2 rather than a downregulation of HER2 protein at the cell surface.
The synergistic action of trastuzumab and pertuzumab combination treatment was previously shown in vitro (30) using the calculation of the combination index as outlined by Chou and Talalay
(35, 36). In the present work, combination treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab dramatically enhanced the antitumor
effect compared with each drug alone: whereas single agent treatments could only delay tumor growth (transiently in KPL-4), the
combination treatment induced effective tumor regressions and
cures in both xenograft models. We believe that this qualitative
difference in antitumor efficacy is a consequence of the synergistic
action of both antibodies described in vitro.
In vitro studies investigating the mechanism of action of trastuzumab and pertuzumab have shown that these agents bind to
different epitopes on the HER2 protein (27, 37); however, concomitant

binding to HER2-positive tumors has not been shown in vivo. Using
NIRF imaging, we show for the first time that in vivo binding of trastuzumab and pertuzumab is not mutually exclusive. Similar
amounts of pertuzumab and trastuzumab, respectively, can bind
to HER2-positive tumors when used either in monotherapy or in
combination.
Activation of ADCC has been described as a major mechanism
of action of trastuzumab (13, 14, 38) and the present study confirms that this is also a property of pertuzumab. Since trastuzumab
and pertuzumab are able to bind simultaneously to tumors in vivo,
we investigated if the strongly enhanced antitumor effect of these
two agents was due to enhanced ADCC. Each antibody alone mediated a strong activation of ADCC, reaching comparable levels of
maximal specific target cell lysis. The combination of trastuzumab
and pertuzumab (final total antibody concentration identical to
those in the single antibody assays) resulted in dose-response
curves indistinguishable from those obtained with the single antibodies. Thus, the simultaneous binding of trastuzumab and pertuzumab onto target cells mediates an additive but not synergistic
effect on ADCC. The combination of both agents at receptorsaturating concentrations did not enhance this immune effect.
This is likely explained by the high receptor density in HER2-overexpressing target cells, which leads to an antibody load that is
more than sufficient to elicit the maximum activation of immune

www.aacrjournals.org

effector cells. In this respect, the situation is expected to be similar
in vivo because plasma concentrations obtained by therapeutic dosages are above the 20-μg/mL threshold, which ensures HER2
binding saturation with trastuzumab. These data suggest that enhanced ADCC is unlikely to be the mechanism by which the
strongly enhanced activity of trastuzumab and pertuzumab, observed in vivo, is mediated. However, as HER2 overexpression is
not lost after treatment with either trastuzumab or pertuzumab,
ADCC may still provide a mechanism by which both trastuzumab
and pertuzumab can continue to provide an antitumor effect even
after progression on trastuzumab, as observed in recent clinical
trials (39–41). These trials and our data suggest that patients who
progress on trastuzumab therapy may still benefit from continued
trastuzumab and that acquired resistance to trastuzumab is not
equivalent to traditional mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance.
The strongly enhanced activity of trastuzumab and pertuzumab is likely attributable to their alternative, differing mechanisms of action. Previous studies have reported that trastuzumab
can sterically inhibit access for the proteases that cleave the extracellular domain and, therefore, prevent the formation of
p95HER2, the truncated and very active form of HER2 (15,
42). However, trastuzumab is unable to prevent ligand-activated
HER2/HER3 or HER2/HER1 heterodimerization, which may provide tumor cells with an escape mechanism from the inhibitory
effects of trastuzumab. In the current study, downregulation of
HER3 and HER1 mRNA and protein reduced the proliferation
of both Calu-3 and KPL-4 cells. This illustrates the importance of
these pathways in the propagation of HER2-positive tumors and
they may even become more important when ligand-independent
HER2 activation is inhibited by trastuzumab. Pertuzumab prevents
the HER2 protein from dimerizing with HER3 and/or HER1 (26, 27,
29, 43), thus blocking these potential escape pathways. Alternatively, pertuzumab monotherapy can obstruct ligand-activated
HER2 dimerization and signaling but would be unable to prevent
formation of p95HER2, which is readily achieved by trastuzumab.
Thus, the differing mechanisms of action of trastuzumab and
pertuzumab can act in a complementary fashion to provide a more
complete blockade of HER2-mediated signal transduction than
either agent alone.
In the clinical setting, dramatically enhanced antitumor activity of trastuzumab and pertuzumab has been shown in a phase
II clinical trial that investigated the efficacy and safety of a trastuzumab/pertuzumab combination in 66 patients with HER2positive metastatic breast cancer whose disease had progressed
during trastuzumab therapy. Of these patients, 8% had a complete response, with an overall response rate of 24.2% and a
clinical benefit rate of 50% (39). Data from the current study
also indicate a potential role for pertuzumab and trastuzumab
in HER2-positive NSCLC, although it should be noted that HER2
overexpression is rare in NSCLC.

Conclusions
Trastuzumab and pertuzumab in combination have a strongly
enhanced antitumor effect and promote tumor regression in xenograft models of HER2-positive breast cancer and NSCLC. Although
both agents potently activate ADCC, this is unlikely to be the main
mechanism by which the strongly enhanced effects of this combination are mediated. Instead, the differing but complementary
mechanisms of action of trastuzumab and pertuzumab may explain the significantly enhanced antitumor activity produced by

agents may prove to be of substantial benefit to patients who currently respond suboptimally to trastuzumab therapy; further trials
are warranted.
