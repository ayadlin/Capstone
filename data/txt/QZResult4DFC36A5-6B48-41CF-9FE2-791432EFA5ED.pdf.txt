Abstract

Author Manuscript

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) are promising anticancer therapies and have been clinically
used for the treatment of hematological malignancy. However, their efficacy in solid tumors is
marginal and drug resistance hampers their further clinical utility. To develop novel strategies for
the HDI-based anticancer therapeutics in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in the present
study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying resistance to HDI treatment in NSCLC cells.
We show the STAT3-mediated IGF2/IGF-1R signaling cascade as a key modulator for both
acquired and primary HDI resistance. Treatment with HDI up-regulated IGF2 transcription in
NSCLC cells carrying intrinsic or acquired drug resistance via direct binding of STAT3 in IGF2 P3
and P4 promoters. Acetylated STAT3 emerged upon HDAC inhibition was protected from the
proteasome-mediated degradation of STAT3 and functioned as a direct transcription factor for
IGF2 expression. Genomic or pharmacological strategies targeting STAT3 diminished the HDIinduced IGF2 mRNA expression and overcame the resistance to HDI treatment in HDI-resistant
NSCLC- or patient-derived tumor xenograft models. These findings provide new insights into the
role of acetylated STAT3-mediated activation of IGF2 transcription in HDI resistance, suggesting
IGF2 or STAT3 as novel targets to overcome HDI resistance in NSCLC.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDIs) have been anticipated to exert substantial
anticancer activity by selectively inducing transcriptional restoration of epigenetically
silenced tumor suppressor genes through transcription-dependent and transcriptionindependent mechanisms involving hyperacetylation of histones and non-histone proteins27.
Indeed, a small subset of patients with solid or hematologic malignancies enrolled in clinical
trials have shown encouraging responses to vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid),
the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved class I and II HDI5, 9, 29, 30, 42.
However, drug resistance is a major concern for the use of HDIs in anticancer
therapeutics7, 18. Among various potential mechanisms underlying HDI resistance, DNA
hypermethylation represents a mechanism of resistance uniquely relevant to HDIs.
Combining two epigenetic drugs targeting DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and HDAC with
chemotherapy has shown clinical benefit for the treatment of hematologic malignancies14.
However, the mechanism of HDI resistance in solid tumors has been poorly investigated.

Deregulated expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and activation of the type 1
IGF receptor (IGF-1R) signaling network have been implicated in cell proliferation,
survival, and maintenance of self-renewal of cancer stem cells, contributing to resistance to
several types of anticancer regimens2, 3, 6, 11, 36, 44. Overexpression of IGF2 is frequently
due to loss of imprinting (LOI)15, 32, 40, in which methylation of the imprinting control
region (ICR)1, 10, 31 abrogates the binding of zinc finger protein CTCF, which acts as an
insulator that sequesters enhancers downstream of H19 to suppress IGF2 transcription34.
IGF2 expression may be also deregulated by transcription factors, such as E2f3 and
ZFP5722, 41. However, the transcriptional modulation of IGF2 besides genomic imprinting
still needs to be investigated.
In a previous study, we demonstrate that activation of IGF-1R signaling is associated with
primary vorinostat resistance in NSCLC13. According to the previous results, in the present
study, we report the novel finding that deregulated IGF2 overexpression through a novel
mechanism that involves STAT3 mediates intrinsic and acquired resistance to HDI.
Mechanistically, acetylation (K685)-mediated stabilization of STAT3 protein upon HDAC
inhibition cause a transcriptional up-regulation of IGF2. Targeting STAT3 effectively
overcame vorinostat resistance in NSCLC cells and in NSCLC- or patient-derived tumor
xenografts. Our results suggest that targeting the STAT3-IGF2 axis is an effective strategy to
overcome HDI resistance in NSCLC.

Results

The IGF-1R pathway is directly involved in primary and acquired vorinostat resistance in
NSCLC cells
In our previous report, we differentiated a panel of 12 human NSCLC cells based on the cell
response to vorinostat treatment. In the current study, we chose 3 vorinostat-sensitive cells
(H1944, H322, H358 cells) and generated their sublines (VoR) carrying acquired drug
resistance to vorinostat by treating the cell lines with increasing doses of vorinostat for > 6
months. The VoR sublines displayed significantly increased viability (Figure 1a), anchorage-

independent colony-forming ability (Figure 1b), and markedly decreased caspase-3 cleavage
(Figure 1c) upon vorinostat treatment, suggesting successful acquisition of drug resistance.
Notably, a VoR subline H1944R showed a cross resistance to another HDI, romidepsin
(depsipeptide) (Figure 1d). We investigated the mechanisms involved in acquired resistance
to vorinostat. Consistent with our previous results in NSCLC cells with primary resistance to
vorinostat13, treatment with vorinostat induced a dose-dependent up-regulation of IGF-1R
phosphorylation in the VoR sublines but not in the parental vorinostat-sensitive cells (Figure
1e). Moreover, the inhibitory effects of vorinostat on the colony-forming ability of the VoR
cells were significantly enhanced by treatment with an anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody
(mAb) (Figure 1f). Together with our previous observation, these results suggest that the
IGF-1R signaling pathway plays a key role in both primary and acquired vorinostat
resistance.

resistance

Recruitment of STAT3 to the P3 and P4 promoters plays a crucial role in IGF2 transcription
upon HDAC inhibition

Author Manuscript

We investigated the mechanisms underlying vorinostat-induced IGF-1R activation. Because
the vorinostat-induced IGF-1R activation was not followed by an increase in IGF-1R
expression (Figure 1e), we analyzed the effects of vorinostat treatment on IGF1 and IGF2
expression in the vorinostat-sensitive parent cells and their sublines. Vorinostat treatment
was found to induce significant increases in the transcription of IGF2, but not IGF1, in the
VoR sublines compared with their parental cells (Figure 2a). Vorinostat-induced IGF2
transcription was also observed in various cell lines with primary vorinostat resistance
(Figure 2b). An elevated IGF2 secretion upon vorinostat treatment was confirmed with
supernatants from representative primary (H226B) or acquired (H1944R and H322R)
vorinostat resistant cells (Figure 2c). Notably, silencing IGF2 expression by siRNA
transfection (Figure 2d) prevented vorinostat-induced IGF-1R activation (Figure 2e) and
restored vorinostat sensitivity in vorinostat-resistant cells, which was comparable with the
effect of vorinostat on H1944 cells at the same concentration (Figure 2f), suggesting the
involvement of IGF2 in both primary and acquired resistance against vorinostat.

Human IGF2 transcription is modulated by four alternate promoters (P1—P4)28, 43, of
which P3 and P4 are predominant in most tissues43. RT-PCR using 5’ primers specific for
each of the four IGF2 promoters, which gives distinct transcript variants of IGF2, and a
common 3’ primer on exon 7 (Figure 3a) revealed that P3 and P4 promoters directed the
vorinostat-induced IGF2 transcription in NSCLC cells with acquired or primary vorinostat
resistance (Figure 3b). Luciferase reporter assays further confirmed vorinostat-induced
activation of the P3 and P4 promoters (Figure 3c). The P3 and P4 promoters were also
employed for the IGF2 transcription by other clinically available HDIs, including entinostat,
panobinostat, and romidepsin, in both primary (H226B) and acquired (H1944R) vorinostatresistant NSCLC cells (Figure 3d). These findings suggest that P3 and P4 promotermediated IGF2 transcription is a general response to HDAC inhibition and is closely related
to the resistance to HDIs.

STAT3 induces HDI-induced IGF2 expression, eventually leading to resistance to HDI
treatment in NSCLC

Author Manuscript

We assessed the factors responsible for IGF2 transcription upon HDAC inhibition. In light of
our recent finding on the association of STAT3 with IGF2 expression19, the implication of
STAT3 in IGF2 transcription in myoblasts45, and the suggested association of STAT3 with
HDI resistance in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma8, we postulated the implication of STAT3 in
IGF2 transcription and vorinostat resistance. Indeed, genomic (siRNA) (Figure 4a) or
pharmacological (Stattic35) (Figure 4b) inactivation of STAT3 significantly attenuated the
vorinostat-induced IGF2 transcription, especially those directed by the P3 and P4 promoters
(Figure 4c). The P3 and P4 promoter activities were also significantly suppressed by the
Stattic treatment (Figure 4d). These findings indicated the involvement of STAT3 in IGF2
transcription through P3 and P4 promoters. The inhibitory effects of vorinostat on the
anchorage-dependent colony formation (Figure 4e) and tumor growth (Figure 4f) were
significantly enhanced when STAT3 expression was silenced by the STAT3-specific shRNA.
Moreover, significant combinatory antitumor effects of vorinostat and Stattic were observed
in NSCLC patient-derived xenograft tumors (PDXs) (Figure 4g). These data suggest that
increased STAT3 activity plays a key role in IGF2 transcription and vorinostat resistance.
STAT3 directly binds to P3 and P4 promoter of IGF2 gene, leading to HDI-induced IGF2
transcription

Author Manuscript

We investigated whether STAT3 directly binds to IGF2 promoter for the transcriptional
regulation of the gene. Indeed, the JASPAR database predicted one (P3-S1) and six (P4-S1
to P4-S6) potential STAT3-binding sites in the IGF2 P3 and P4 promoters, respectively
(Figure 5a). The colorimetric DNA-binding ELISA (DELISA) using DNA sequences that
encompass the seven potential STAT3-binding regions within the promoters revealed that
vorinostat treatment significantly increased STAT3 binding to the P3-S1, P4-S3/4, and P4S5/6 (Figure 5b). The specificity of this binding was confirmed by competition assay using
excess wild-type (WT) but not mutant (M) oligomers (Figure 5c). The ChIP assay also
demonstrated the STAT3 occupancy to the potential sites (Figure 5d). Moreover, mutation of
potential STAT3 binding sites resulted in significant ablation of vorinostat-induced
activation of IGF2 P3 and P4 promoters (Figure 5e). These results indicate the direct binding
of STAT3 in IGF2 P3 and P4 promoters, thereby leading to increase IGF2 transcription and
subsequent drug resistance upon vorinostat treatment.
STAT3 protein acetylation upon HDAC inhibition is crucial for its stabilization and thus for
IGF2 expression

Author Manuscript

We determined the mechanisms by which STAT3 mediates vorinostat-induced IGF2
transcription. Notably, vorinostat treatment increased expression and acetylation (K685), but
not phosphorylation (Y705), of STAT3 protein in both vorinostat-sensitive H1944 cells and
all of vorinostat-resistant cells (Figure 6a). We then assessed the impact of acetylation on
STAT3 function by employing H1299 cells, in which endogenous STAT3 was stably
depleted by shRNA transfection and then wild type (WT) or acetylation-null mutant STAT3
(K685R) were introduced. Vorinostat treatment induced time-dependent increases in both
total and acetylated STAT3 (Ac-STAT3) primarily in the nuclear compartment (Figure 6b),

which were abrogated by the STAT3 mutation (K685R) (Figure 6c). In line with the
findings, vorinostat-mediated increases in transcription (Figure 6d) and P3 and P4 promoter
activities (Figure 6e) and secretion (Figure 6f) of IGF2 were attenuated by the STAT3
mutation. Immunofluorescence staining further confirmed markedly decreased IGF2
expression and nuclear Ac-STAT3 contents by the STAT3 mutation (Figure 6g). Moreover,
abrogation of STAT acetylation substantially enhanced vorinostat’s effects on apoptosis
(Figure 6h) and colony formation (Figure 6i). These results suggest that IGF2 expression
upregulated by increased STAT3 acetylation is crucial for vorinostat resistance.

Author Manuscript

Intriguingly, the STAT3 mutation decreased both Ac-STAT3 and STAT3 levels (Figures 6c
and 6h). Hence, we addressed the effects of the mutation (K685R) on half-life of STAT3.
Surprisingly, the half-life of STAT3 protein was dramatically decreased by the mutation
(Figure 6j). Moreover, treatment with a proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased the levels of
ubiquitinated form of the STAT3 mutant. The mutant STAT3 protein levels were also
increased by the MG132 treatment (Figure 6k). These data suggest that increased STAT3
activity through the acetylation-mediated protein stabilization from proteasome-mediated
degradation plays a key role in IGF2 transcription and vorinostat resistance.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Despite considerable enthusiasm about the use of HDIs as an anticancer therapy, several
clinical trials have shown poor responses to these drugs. However, molecular determinants
of resistance to HDIs, especially those responsible for acquired resistance due to chronic
exposure to HDIs, are poorly understood. Understanding the mechanisms that determine
resistance to HDIs would grant the basis for therapeutic combinations with improved clinical
efficacy. In the current study, we show that transcriptional up-regulation of IGF2 via
acetylated STAT3 play a key role in both de novo and acquired resistance to HDIs. We
propose that HDAC inhibition increases functional STAT3 levels in the nuclear compartment
through acetylation-mediated protein stabilization, leading to P3/P4 promoter-mediated
IGF2 transcription. We also show that blockade of STAT3 effectively suppresses the HDIinduced IGF2 transcription and potentiates the therapeutic efficacy of HDIs in human
NSCLC cells and PDXs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the
deregulated function of STAT3 through acetylation as a determinant of IGF2 transcription
and HDI resistance.

HDIs are known to alter function of various proteins, thereby regulating expression of tumor
suppressor genes and interfering with cancer cell proliferation and survival. However, cancer
cells are highly adjustable - a feature that enables them to cope with such inhibitory
constraints and thus contributes to the development of drug resistance. Here we demonstrate
that, in both acquired and de novo HDI-resistant tumors, transcriptional increase in IGF2
plays a universal role in activation of the IGF-1R pathway and thus mediating resistance to
HDIs. We show that: 1) various HDIs led to the transcriptional increase in IGF2 expression
in both primary and acquired HDI-resistant NSCLC cells through P3- and P4-directed
promoter activities; and 2) knock-down IGF2 expression sensitized both primary and
acquired vorinostat-resistant cells to the drug treatment, indicate an IGF2 dependency of
NSCLC for HDI resistance. These findings are in line with the previous report showing

ineffectiveness of HDIs to induce apoptosis through activation of the Akt pathway13, 24.
Under that scenario, one could design approaches targeting IGF-1R as a therapeutic option
to overcome HDI resistance. However, IGF-1R targeting by monoclonal antibody (mAb) or
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has been challenging due to weak efficacy and drug
resistance through various mechanisms26, 37, 38. Thus, we propose that, instead of targeting
IGF-1R, understanding the IGF2 biology and identifying the key factors involved in HDIinduced IGF2 transcription would be practical to develop therapeutic strategies overcoming
the HDI resistance.

Author Manuscript

Previously, STAT3 has been suggested as a factor for HDI resistance in hematologic cancer8.
However, functional significance, downstream effectors, and therapeutic merits of targeting
STAT3 in HDI resistance have been elusive. Our IGF2 promoter studies both primary and
acquired HDI-resistant cells reveal a direct binding of STAT3 to the P3/P4 IGF2 promoters
and the STAT3 dependency of the NSCLC cells for the HDI-induced IGF2 transcription.
Moreover, genomic and pharmacologic approaches targeting STAT3 effectively suppressed
the HDI-induced IGF2 transcription and restored drug sensitivity in both primary and
acquired HDI-resistant cells. Most importantly, inactivation of STAT3 universally suppresses
the vorinostat-induced IGF2 gene expression and restores vorinostat sensitivity in both
primary and acquired HDI-resistant NSCLC cells and PDXs. These findings indeicated the
universal role of STAT3 in NSCLC cells’ resistance to HDIs.

Author Manuscript

In our study, HDAC inhibition was found to cause a rapid STAT3 acetylation (K685),
protecting STAT3 from the proteasome-mediated degradation, and increase in its nuclear
localization and the activity as a transcriptional factor. Previous studies have demonstrated
STAT3 acetylation by histone acetyltransferase p30017, 48. The role of STAT3 acetylation at
at a single lysine residue (K685) in its dimerization has been reported17, 48, 49. Therefore, it
is likely that HDAC inhibition results in stabilization of STAT3 through acetylation, leading
to increases in its dimerization and activity as a transcription factor. These results support
the role of STAT3 as a direct transcription factor for IGF2 expression, placing it as a key
node for HDI resistance. In addition to the IGF2-IGF-1R pathway, STAT3 modulates
numerous genes thereby playing diverse roles in cancer cell proliferation, survival, and
metastasis4. Together, these findings endorse the broad clinical utility of the combinatorial
therapy with HDI and STAT3 in HDI-based clinical trials. However, increases in both total
and acetylated STAT3 were also found in vorinostat-sensitive cells (Figure 6a), implying the
existence of an additional factor associated with vorinostat resistance. Further studies are
underway to investigate additional determinants of vorinostat resistance.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, we reveal the role of the STAT3-IGF2 axis in both de novo and acquired
resistance to HDIs. The combinatorial regimens of HDIs with STAT3-targeted drugs are
effective in both primary and acquired HDI resistance. As some STAT3 inhibitors and IGF2
neutralizing antibodies have been recently investigated in clinical trials46, 47, our findings
will have a direct impact on the relevant clinical trials with HDIs. In addition, considering
the immunomodulatory properties of HDIs20, understanding the properties of the IGF2IGF-1R axis in compromising the antitumor effects of HDIs would be also important for
combinatorial anticancer therapeutics using HDIs and other anticancer agents including

the novel combinatorial strategies are warranted.

Establishment of vorinostat-resistant cell Lines

Author Manuscript

For generating H1944R cells, H1944 cells were exposed to 0.2 μM vorinostat for 48 h in
RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, washed, and then cultured in drug-free medium
until the surviving population of cells re-established 80% confluence. The process was
repeated for 2 months with sequentially increased dosages of vorinostat (0.5-5 μM). The
established resistant cell line (H1944R) was maintained by culture in a medium containing 5
μM vorinostat. In addition, vorinostat-resistant H358 and H322 cells (designated ‘R’) were
established as follows. H358 and H322 cells were treated with gradually increasing
concentrations of vorinostat (0.1 to 2 μM) for more than 6 months. For all the in vitro
studies, the resistant cells were cultured in drug-free medium for at least 1 week to eliminate
the effects of vorinostat.
Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded into 96 well plates at a density of 1-2 × 103 cells/well. Cells were treated
with vorinostat for 3 days. Cells were incubated with the MTT solution (final 200-500
μg/ml) for 3 h at 37°C. The formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO and the absorbance
was measured at 570 nm.

Total cell lysates were prepared with modified RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4],
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaF,
1mM Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN,
USA]). To prepare cytosolic and nuclear fractions, we used buffer A (10 mM HEPES [pH
7.9], 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, and protease inhibitor cocktail)
and buffer C (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 420 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, and
protease inhibitor cocktail), respectively.
Equal amounts of lysates were subjected to 8–10% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were
transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
Membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (5% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20
[PBST]) for 1 h at room temperature (RT) and followed by incubation with primary
antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (1:1,000) overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed
with PBST and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies diluted in 3% non-fat
dry milk in PBST (1:5,000) for 1–2 h at RT. Membranes were washed with PBST and were
visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Thermo Fisher

Transfections

Author Manuscript

For knockdown of IGF-1R, IGF2, or STAT3 expression, cells were transiently transfected
with either scrambled small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Shanghai GenePharma, Shanghai,
China) or siRNAs targeting IGF2 or STAT3 (Dharmacon [Lafayette, CO, USA] or Shanghai

Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR)

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated using a phenol-chloroform extraction, reverse-transcribed, and
analyzed by RT–PCR or a SYBR Green-based real-time PCR (LightCycler 480 real-time
PCR system, Roche). The thermocycler conditions for RT–PCR were as follows: initial
denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; 28–35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55-60°C for 30 s, and 72°C
for 30 s; final elongation at 72°C for 5-7 min. The thermocycler conditions for real-time
PCR were as follows: pre-incubation at 95°C for 5 min, 50 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for
10 s, and 72°C for 10 s, and melting curve analysis for determining reaction specificity. In
addition, the promoter (P1–P4)-specific transcripts of the IGF2 gene were analyzed as
described in the previous report16. PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis and visualized using a Gel Doc EZ System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA, USA). Relative quantification of mRNA expression was performed by the comparative
CT (cycle threshold) method as described previously21. The primer sequences used for the
PCR and the real-time PCR are described in Supplementary Tables S1-S3.
IGF2 ELISA
IGF2 ELISA was performed using a commercially available IGF2 ELISA kit (catalog #

Determination of protein stability and ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal degradation

Author Manuscript

To determine the impact of STAT3 acetylation on STAT3 protein stability, H1299 cells
expressing WT or mutant STAT3 were treated with cycloheximide (CHX; 50 μg/ml) for 3, 6,
and 9 h, and the level of total and acetylated STAT3 was determined by Western blot
analysis. In addition, to examine the involvement of ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
degradation of STAT3 in the STAT3 destabilization, cells were exposed to MG132 (10 μM)
for 6 h. Total STAT3 expression was determined by Western blot analysis. In addition,
lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies, followed by Western blot
analysis to detect the level of ubiquitination using anti-ubiquitin antibodies.
Immunofluorescence

Author Manuscript

Immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously12 using the antibodies
against IGF2 and Ac-STAT3. Briefly, cells were seeded onto coverslip and treated with
vorinostat for 2 days. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Coverslips were
incubated with the blocking buffer (5% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 in TBS), and then
incubated with anti-Ac-STAT3 or anti-IGF2 (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) primary
antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. After washing, coverslips were incubated with the
corresponding FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed, and then mounted with a
mounting solution containing DAPI. The fluorescence was observed under the fluorescent
microscope.
DNA ELISA

Author Manuscript

DNA ELISA was performed as described previously25 with some modifications. ELISA
plates pre-coated with annealed oligonucleotides corresponding to predicted STAT3-binding
regions at the IGF2 P3 and P4 promoters, identified using the JASPAR database23, using
React-Bind DNA coating solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc, Grand Island, NY, USA)
for 1 h at RT. After blocking with the blocking buffer (4% BSA in PBS), nuclear extracts (5
μg/well), diluted in the dilution buffer (12 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 60 mM KCl, 0.4 mM
EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 12% glycerol, 35 μg/ml poly (dI-dC)), were added and incubated for 3
h at 4°C. After washing with TBST, primary antibodies (200 ng/ml anti-STAT3 antibodies in
4% BSA in PBS) were added to the plates and incubated for 1 h at RT. After washing with
TBST, secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit-HRP [Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX,
USA]; diluted in 1:20,000) were added to the plates and incubated for 30 min at RT. After
washing with TBST, 50 μl of 3,3’,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution (Sigma-Aldrich)
was added to each well and incubated for 20 min at RT. After adding stop solution (50 μl of
0.1 N HCl), absorbance was measured at 450 nm.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
ChIP was performed using the SimpleChIP enzymatic chromatin IP kit (Cell Signaling
Technology) according to the manufacturer’s provided protocol. In brief, the chromatin
cross-linked to proteins was digested with micrococcal nuclease. The digested chromatin
was immunoprecipitated with control IgG or anti-STAT3 (Santa Cruz or Cell Signaling)
antibodies. The DNA-protein cross-links of immunoprecipitants were reversed and then
DNA was purified. The association between STAT3 and the potential STAT3-binding

regions at the IGF2 P3 and P4 promoters, identified using the JASPAR database23, was
analyzed by PCR. The PCR primers used for ChIP are described in Supplementary Table S4.
PCR products were subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized using a Gel
Doc EZ System (Bio-Rad).
Animal Studies

Author Manuscript

All animal procedures were performed using a protocol approved by the Seoul National
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. H1299 (stably transfected with
shRNAs targeting STAT3) cells (5 × 106 cells/spot) were subcutaneously injected into the
flanks of a 5–6-week-old female NOD/SCID mice. For PDX, small pieces of tumors derived
from NSCLC patients were subcutaneously inoculated into the flanks of 5–6-week-old
female NOD/SCID mice. After the tumor volume reached 50–150 mm3, mice were
randomly grouped to give equal mean tumor size and body weight in each group and
intraperitoneally treated with vehicle (distilled water containing 10% DMSO and 45%
polyethylene glycol 400) or drugs, alone or in combination, six times per week for 18 days
in an unblinded fashion. Tumor growth was determined by measuring the short and long
diameters of the tumor with a caliper, and body weight was measured twice per week to
monitor toxicity. The tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: tumor
volume (mm3) = (short diameter)2 × (long diameter) × 0.5.
Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

The data are presented as the mean ± SD. All in vitro experiments were independently
performed at least twice, and a representative result is presented. We assessed the outcome
of data in a blinded fashion. We carried out Student’s t-test (unpaired, two-sided) using
Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) to analyze the statistical
significance of difference of in vitro data. We assumed the equal variance of each data in the
statistical analysis using Student’s t-test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by Newman-Keuls post hoc test using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla,
CA, USA) was performed to analyze the statistical significance of difference of in vivo data.
We could not analyze normal distribution of data using D’Agostino and Pearson normality
test due to sample size. We did not perform power analysis to estimate sample size. The total
sample size (‘n’) and statistical method are indicated in figure legends. P values less than
0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Figure 5. Direct binding of STAT3 to IGF2 P3 and P4 promoters

Author Manuscript

(a and c) Schematic of the seven potential STAT-binding sites in IGF2 P3 and P4 promoters
(P3-S1 located in promoter 3 and P4-S1 to P4-S6 located in promoter 4) predicted by the
JASPAR database. (c) The wild-type (WT) and mutant (M) DNA sequences for the putative
STAT3-binding sites in IGF2 P3 and P4 promoters. #1 and #2 indicate the mutation of each
potential STAT3 binding site of P4-S3/4 and P4-S5/6 in (e). Locations were determined by
comparison with the GenBank sequence database (Chromosome 11; the reference genome
assembly: GRCh38.p2) using BLAST. (b-d) Direct STAT3 binding to the putative STAT3binding sites after treatment with vorinostat (5 μM) for 2 days, evaluated by the DNA
ELISA assay (b) using the oligomers carrying the DNA sequences indicated in (c) (n = 3)

and by ChIP assay (d) using the PCR primers encompassing the putative STAT3-binding
sites indicated in (a) by arrows. Specificity of the binding in the ELISA assay was
determined by pre-incubating the cell lysates with 2- and 5-fold excess amounts of WT or
mutant (M) STAT3 oligomers (c, right). (e) Luciferase reporter assay evaluating the effects
of vorinostat (5 μM) on IGF2 promoters 3 and 4 carrying WT or mutations in the putative
STAT3-binding sites described in (c) (n = 3). Cells were treated with vorinostat for 2 days. *:

Figure 6. Acetylated STAT3 by vorinostat treatment leads to stabilization, thereby mediating
vorinostat-induced IGF2 transcription

Author Manuscript

(a) Immunoblots evaluating the expression of acetylated, phosphorylated, and total STAT3 in
indicated cells treated with vorinostat (5 μM) for 2 days. (b) Immunoblots evaluating the
expression of acetylated (Ac-STAT3), phosphorylated (pSTAT3), and total STAT3 in the
cytosol or nuclear compartments of H1299 cells upon vorinostat treatment for the indicated
time periods. The numbers below STAT3 blots indicate densitometry of STAT3 blots
normalized by loading controls (nuclear compartment: PARP, cytosolic compartment:
tubulin). Densitometric analysis was performed using Image J software. (c) Immunoblots
evaluating nuclear (NE) and cytosolic (CE) expression of STAT3 and Ac-STAT3 after the
vorinostat treatment (5 μM) in H1299 cells expressing WT or mutant (K/R) STAT3 for 36 h.

days. (d) RT–PCR analysis evaluating the vorinostat-mediated IGF2 mRNA expression in
H1299 cells expressing WT or mutant (K/R) STAT3. (e) Activation of IGF2 P3 (left) and P4
(right) promoters was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay after vorinostat treatment (n =
3). (f) The IGF2 secretion in CMs obtained from vorinostat-treated cells was determined by
ELISA (n = 3). (g) Immunofluorescence staining of Ac-STAT3 and IGF2 after vorinostat
treatment. (h) Western blot analysis evaluating total and acetylated STAT3 expressions and
PARP cleavage in H1299 cells expressing WT or mutant (K/R) STAT3 after treatment with
vorinostat (5 μM) for 2 days. (i) Enhanced inhibitory effects of vorinostat (1 μM) on the
anchorage-dependent colony formation of H1299 cells expressing stably depleted STAT3
levels (n = 3). (j) Immunoblots evaluating the half-life of wild type (WT) and mutant (K/R)
STAT3 protein after treatment with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for the indicated time points.
(k) The level of wild type (WT) and mutant (K/R) STAT3 ubiquitination in H1299 cells was
determined by immunoprecipitation (IP) with a GFP antibody and western blot analysis
(WB) with an antibody against ubiquitin. Immunoblots determining the STAT3 expression in
whole cell lysates (WCL) are included. ***: P < 0.001, analyzed by two-sided Student’s ttest. Vo: vorinostat. RLU: relative luminescence units. Ub: ubiquitin.
