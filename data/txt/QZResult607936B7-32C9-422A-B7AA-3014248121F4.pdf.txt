ABSTRACT:
	
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer, accounting
for 90% of primary liver cancers. In the last decade it has become one of the most
frequently occurring tumors worldwide and is also considered to be the most lethal
of the cancer systems, accounting for approximately one third of all malignancies.
	
Although the clinical diagnosis and management of early-stage HCC has
improved significantly, HCC prognosis is still extremely poor. Furthermore, advanced
HCC is a highly aggressive tumor with a poor or no response to common therapies.
Therefore, new effective and well-tolerated therapy strategies are urgently needed.
	
Targeted therapies have entered the field of anti-neoplastic treatment and
are being used on their own or in combination with conventional chemotherapy
drugs. Molecular-targeted therapy holds great promise in the treatment of HCC. A
new therapeutic opportunity for advanced HCC is the use of sorafenib (Nexavar).
On the basis of the recent large randomized phase III study, the Sorafenib HCC
Assessment Randomized Protocol (SHARP), sorafenib has been approved by the FDA
for the treatment of advanced HCC. Sorafenib showed to be able to significantly
increase survival in patients with advanced HCC, establishing a new standard of care.
Despite this promising breakthrough, patients with HCC still have a dismal prognosis,
as it is currently the major cause of death in cirrhotic patients. Nevertheless, the
successful results of the SHARP trial underscore the need for a comprehensive
understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this devastating disease.
	
In this review we summarize the most important studies on the
signaling pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC, as well as
the newest emerging drugs and their potential use in HCC management.

INTRODUCTION

the world, as important differences have been noted
between countries, with most cases occurring in Eastern
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, while low rate areas are
in North America, northern Europe and Australia [3,
4]. Changes in liver cancer incidence are beginning
to be reported, namely a certain degree of reduction in
the high-rate areas, particularly in China, thanks to the
implementation of universal hepatitis B virus vaccination
and limitation to aflatoxin B1 exposure [5, 6], while

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most
common liver cancer, accounting for 90% of primary
liver cancers. In the last decade it has become one of the
most frequently occurring tumors worldwide and is also
considered to be the most lethal of the cancer systems,
accounting for approximately one third of all malignancies
[1, 2]. Distribution, however, is not homogeneous around

increasing incidences are being reported in low-rate areas,
particularly in the United Kingdom and Australia [7].
By far the most frequent risk factor for HCC is liver
cirrhosis (LC), this underlying disease being present
in a variable proportion of cases, reaching a 90% rate
in western countries [8]. The main etiological agents of
LC are the hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV)
viruses, which together account for three quarters of all
HCC cases worldwide. The diffusion of these viruses in
the world reflects regional differences in the quantitative
and qualitative (etiological) pattern of HCC. Other risk
factors include aflatoxin B1 intake, alcohol consumption,
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and some
hereditary diseases, including hereditary hemochromatosis
[9]. In the last few years a great body of evidence has been
reported about the possibility that some severe forms of
NAFLD may progress to HCC. NAFLD is usually part of
the metabolic syndrome, found namely in patients with
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity and
insulin resistance, which is becoming very frequent in
western populations, due to their life style (sedentariness)
and diet. It has also been called into question in many
cases of HCC of “cryptogenetic” origin [10-12]. In
particular, several studies suggest that obese patients are
also at increased risk for several types of cancer, including
HCC. Recently, a meta-analysis found that the relative
risks (RR) for liver cancer were higher in obese (Body
Mass Index, BMI 30) than in overweight subjects (BMI
= 25–30) [13].
HCC predominantly affects males, with a male to
female ratio averaging 2:1 and 4:1 [9], although after the
menopause no significant differences have been reported
between the sexes [14]. For this reason sex hormones
have been thought to play a possible role in neoplastic
degeneration and various therapeutic evaluations based
on anti-androgen or anti-estrogen agents have been
performed, albeit with disappointing results [15].
We can therefore state that the pathogenesis of
HCC is very complex and not completely clear. As in
most cancers, HCC pathogenesis is a multistep process,
involving sequential events such as chronic inflammation,
hyperplasia and dysplasia and ultimately malignant
transformation. It is a very long process, which usually
takes even up to 30 years and during these years there are
a number of epigenetic and genetic alterations, ultimately
leading to an alteration in the molecular pathways.
Several results indicate that there is no dominant pathway
specifically altered in HCC [16]. Indeed, there are several
subclasses of tumors presenting distinct molecular
aberrations responsible for cell proliferation and survival,
while other alterations present in almost all tumors
involve limitless replicative potential, neoangiogenesis,
and insensitivity to antigrowth signals and checkpoint
disruption [16]. Recent discoveries in the complex
networks involved in HCC proliferation, progression and
survival have created many opportunities for targeted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drugs and new therapeutic approaches to this disease.
These new targets include signal transduction pathways,
oncogenes and growth factors and their receptors.
In this review we will focus on the most frequently
dysregulated signaling pathways implicated in the
pathogenesis of HCC, as well as the newest emerging
drugs and their potential use in the management of HCC.

SIGNALING PATHWAYS
The key signal transduction pathways that have
been implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC include
those mediated by epidermal growth factor (EGF)/EGF
receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF)/PDGF receptor (PDGFR), insulinlike growth factor (IGF)/IGF receptor (IGFR), and the
Ras/Raf/mitogen-extracellular activated protein kinase
kinase (MEK)/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK), Wnt/β-catenin, and phosphatidylinositol-3kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted
on chromosome ten (PTEN)/Akt/mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways (Figures 1-3).
Further attention is required to determine the relevance
and therapeutic potential of other pathways involved in
liver carcinogenesis, such as the interleukin 6 (IL-6),
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and
Hedgehog signaling pathways.
Activation of these pathways will eventually lead to
resistance to apoptosis, cell proliferation, the stimulation
of angiogenesis, invasiveness and metastasis. In the
past decade there has been significant breakthroughs in
the discovery of interacting pathway components and
insights into how mutations of these components can
lead to aberrant signaling, uncontrolled proliferation and
even sensitivity/resistance to targeted therapy [17-19].
Research has resulted in to the development of inhibitors
that specifically target critical elements of these pathways
as well as the concept that mutations at one signaling
molecule in the pathways (e.g., EGFR, Ras, B-Raf) may
prevent sensitivity to an inhibitor targeting a downstream
component (e.g., Raf, MEK or PI3K) [20-25]. These
studies indicate that the mutational status of key genes in
the pathway (e.g., Ras, B-Raf) will have to be determined
in cancer patients before applications of targeted therapy
[17]. While sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors in non small
cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) is often due to mutations
(L858R) or small deletions in exon 19 in the kinase
domain, initial sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors may be
lost due to subsequent mutations in the kinase domain.
Other mutations in the kinase domain of EGFR prevent
the induction of pro-apoptotic Bim in response to EGFR
inhibitors. In some cases of NSCLC which have become
resistant to EGFR inhibitors, they over express the c-Met
proto-oncogene. Finally K-Ras mutations confer resistance
to EGFR inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib or antibodies such
237

as cetuximab). In some cases resistance to either Raf/
MEK or PI3K may occur as some upstream mutations
(e.g., EGFR mutations) activate both Raf/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Treatment
of cells with Ras mutations with certain mutant allele
selective B-Raf inhibitors can result in Raf-1 activation.
Dominant negative B-Raf mutations can still bind and
activate Raf-1 if the cell has a mutant Ras allele. Finally
some B-Raf inhibitor resistant cells overexpress various
critical cell cycle regulatory molecules such as cyclin D.
The various mechanisms of inhibitor resistance involving
other components in these pathways are explained in more
detail in McCubrey et al. [17]. Many recent studies are
directed at increasing cancer patient survival by targeting
these and other pathways in cancer cells.
Illustrations of the most important receptors and
intracellular molecular signaling pathways, as well as
sites of intervention with small molecule inhibitors
and monoclonal antibodies are presented in Figures
1-2. Certain molecular-targeted agents are actually
promiscuous (e.g. sorafenib, regorafenib, sunitinib,
brivanib and others), i.e. they simultaneously target
more than one molecule and this multiple targeting could
enhance their therapeutic efficacy, while others act on a
single target (e.g. AZD6244, AZD8055, everolimus and

others) (Figure 1).

EGF/EGFR PATHWAY
The EGFR (also known as ErbB1 and Her1) belongs
to the ERB family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
which includes ErbB2 (also known as Her2), ErbB3
(also known as Her3) and ErbB4 (also known as Her4).
The members are all endowed with tyrosine kinase (TK)
activity, with the exception of ErbB3. All members
share a common structure, showing an extracellular
ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an
intracellular domain where the tyrosine kinase activity
resides. EGFR forms homo- or heterodimers upon ligand
binding. Dimerization results in auto-phosphorylation
of EGFR with the subsequent activation of a number of
downstream signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR and the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways (Figure 2).
With the exception of ErbB2, which has no ligand, all
the other members can bind a family of growth factors.
Ligands for EGFR are EGF, TGF-α, epigenin (EPG),
amphiregulin (AREG), heparin-binding-EGF (HB-EGF),
epirugulin (EREG) and β-cellulin (BTC) and the last
three ligands are also able to bind to ErbB4/Her4. The

nucleotide polymorphism in the EGF gene, involving A to
G transition at position 61 in the 5′ untranslated region of
the EGF gene (SNP rs4444903). The transcript of patients
with SNP exhibited more than a 2-fold longer half-life
than those from the wt allele and serum EGF levels were
1.8-fold higher in G/G patients than A/A patients, while
liver EGF levels were 2.4-fold higher in G/G patients than
in A/A patients. Whether higher EGF levels are associated
with a greater risk of developing cirrhosis and a shorter
time taken to develop cirrhosis were aspects not addressed
by this study. However, the observation that the severity
of cirrhosis did not differ between A/A, A/G, and G/G
patients argues against this possibility [32].

neuregulin (NRG) ligands NRG-1 and NGR-2 bind to both
ErbB3/Her3 and ErbB4/Her4, whereas NGR-3 and NGR-4
only recognize ErbB4/Her4.
The receptor most studied in HCC is EGFR/
ErbB1. The rationale for targeting the EGFR pathway
comes from the following observations: there is a high
frequency of EGFR overexpression in HCC [26-29],
and this overexpression has been associated with latestage disease, increased cell proliferation and degree of
tumor differentiation [28-30]. In addition, activation of
the EGFR pathway is a prognostic predictor of survival
in patients with HCC [31]. Therefore, EGFR represents a
good potential molecular target for the biological therapy
of HCC.
The importance of EGF/EGFR signaling in the
development of HCC has been confirmed in two recent
studies showing that cirrhotic patients with high levels
of serum and tissue EGF have a higher adjusted risk of
developing HCC compared to cirrhotic patients with
EGF levels comparable to healthy subjects [32, 33].
High levels of EGF are due to the presence of a single-

RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK PATHWAY
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, also known as the
MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway, is a
signaling pathway consisting of a kinase cascade regulated
by phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation by specific
kinases and phosphatases as well as GTP/GDP exchange

Deregulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway
plays a key role in the pathogenesis of several human
cancers [17, 41, 42], including HCC [21, 43-48].
Although mutations of Ras and Raf occur infrequently in
HCC, a recent study demonstrated that activation of the
Ras pathway was observed in 100% of HCC specimens
analyzed when compared with non-neoplastic surrounding
tissue and normal livers. This increased expression of
Ras coincided with the decreased expression of genes
which serve to inhibit Ras expression, namely the Rasassociation domain family 1A (RASSF1A) and the
novel Ras effector 1A (NORE1A). These genes may be
suppressed due to aberrant methylation of their promoters
[49]. In addition, activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway in HCC may be due to the down-regulation of
Ras inhibitors Sprouty and Sprouty-related protein with
Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology-1
domain (Spred-1) and Spred-2 [50, 51]. It has been
shown that the expression of Spred-1 and -2 in human
HCC tissues is frequently lower than in the adjacent nontumor tissue and inversely correlates with the incidence
of tumor invasion and metastasis [51]. Moreover, forced
expression of Spred inhibited HCC cell proliferation both
in vitro and in vivo, which was associated with reduced
ERK activation, suggesting that Spred could be not only
a novel prognostic factor but also a new therapeutic target
for human HCC [51]. Recently, studies have also shown
that down-regulation of Raf kinase inhibitor protein
(RKIP) expression is a major factor in the activation of the
ERK/MAPK pathway during human liver carcinogenesis
[52, 53].
Deregulation of the ERK pathway has clinical
importance in HCC. Activation of the ERK signaling
pathway predicts poor prognosis in hepatocellular
carcinoma [54]. The important role of ERK signaling
has also been suggested for HCC progression in obese
patients. A possible explanation for an associated risk for
obesity and HCC comes from the study of Saxena et al.,
which for the first time demonstrated that leptin, a key
molecule involved in the regulation of energy balance
and body weight control, promotes HCC growth and
invasiveness through activation of ERK signaling [55].
Other well known risk factors for HCC such as HBV
and HCV infection also seem to utilize the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway for the control of hepatocyte survival and viral
replication [56, 57]. HBx, one of the four proteins encoded
by the HBV genome, has been reported to be involved
in liver carcinogenesis, with HBx expression activating
the Ras, Raf, MAP kinase signaling cascade [56, 58-60].
Among the HCV components, the core protein has been
reported to activate the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and
thereby might contribute to HCC carcinogenesis [57, 61,
62]. Therefore, these studies suggested the possible use
of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway as a target in therapeutic

proteins, adaptor proteins and scaffolding proteins (Figure
2). In response to a variety of cellular stimuli, including
growth factor-mediated activation of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs), Ras assumes an activated GTP-bound
state, leading to recruitment of Raf from the cytosol to
the cell membrane, where it becomes activated, likely via
a Src-family tyrosine kinase [20, 21, 34-36]. Activated
Raf causes the phosphorylation and activation of MAP
kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2
(MEK1/MEK2), which in turn phosphorylate and activate
extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/
ERK2) at specific Thr and Tyr residues [37]. Activated
ERK can translocate into the nucleus and phosphorylate
additional transcription factors, such as Elk-1, CREB,
Fos and globin transcription factor 1 (Gata-1) as well as
others, which bind promoters of many genes, including
growth factor and cytokine genes, which are important
in promoting growth and preventing the apoptosis of

approaches for the treatment of HCC resulting from HBV
and HCV infection. Taken together, these data suggest that
the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway may represent an important
therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC in patients
with differing etiologies that lead to the development of
this aggressive tumor.
Activation of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling in HCC
may result from up-regulation of IGF [63], aberrant
upstream EGFR signaling [64] and other receptor signaling
(i.e. VEGFR and PDGFR). An effective blockade of the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway can be achieved using small
molecules, such as lonafarnib, sorafenib, regorafenib,
AZD6244 and others (Figures 1 and 2). Drugs inhibiting
components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, with the
exception of sorafenib, are still in the pre-clinical phase
or in phase I/II clinical trials for HCC therapy (Table 1).

accomplished through the action of the PTEN tumor
suppressor protein. PTEN in turn dephosphorylates PIP3,
thus inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway.
Activation of PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling
through the mutation, inactivation or silencing of pathway
components occurs in various malignancies, including
HCC [78]. Deregulation of this pathway has been
documented to have clinical importance in HCC. For
example, recent data from a genomic sequence of HCC
samples identified mutations in PIK3CA, an upstream
regulator of Akt, in 50% of patients with poor prognosis
and survival length < 3 years following partial liver
resection, whereas only 10% of the HCC patients with a
good prognosis had a mutation in PIK3CA [79]. Activation
of Akt is a risk factor for early disease recurrence and
poor prognosis in patients with HCC [54, 80]. Several
mechanisms may be responsible for the activation of
Akt. The high frequency of PIK3CA mutations and/or
its upregulation in patients with a shorter survival might
be responsible for the Akt hyperactivation found in HCC
with poor prognosis [80]. Selective epigenetic silencing
of multiple inhibitors of the Ras pathway also seems to be
responsible for the activation of Akt found in HCC [78].
Moreover, impaired expression of PTEN is involved in
the regulation of Akt activity. Activation of Akt signaling
and a reduced expression of PTEN has been reported in
40–60% of human HCC [80].
The best evidence strongly supporting the connection
between PTEN suppression and liver carcinogenesis
comes from genetic studies. All mice with PTEN-deficient
hepatocytes exhibited liver adenomas and 66% of them
developed HCC [81]. In these mice, hepatocytes were
hyperproliferative and displayed an abnormal activation
of Akt [81]. Furthermore, although mutations in the PTEN
gene rarely occur in HCC, frequent loss of heterozygosity
of the PTEN allele has been identified in 20–30% of
HCC patients [82-85]. In addition, downregulation of
PTEN expression may be partly due to PTEN promoter
methylation [86]. Recent studies have also demonstrated
that PTEN expression plays a critical role in HCC
progression and patient survival. Patients with a high
PTEN expression had a significantly better overall survival
than patients with a low expression [87, 88].
An important role of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
pathway has been suggested for HCC progression in
obese patients. In the study by Saxena et al., leptin not
only promoted HCC growth and invasiveness through
activation of ERK pathway, but also through activation
of PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling [55]. The other wellknown risk factors, HBV and HCV, also seem to utilize
the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway to control hepatocyte
survival and viral replication [89, 90]. It has been reported
that HBx expression downregulated PTEN expression in
hepatocytes [91]. In contrast, PTEN expression in liver
cells downregulated HBx-induced PI3K and Akt activities
[92]. Therefore, these studies suggest the possible use of

PI3K/PTEN/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY
The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway is another key
pathway in HCC, its activation inducing cell proliferation
and increasing survival. This pathway is activated after
the binding of different growth factors to specific cell
surface receptors, such as EGFR and IGF-1R (Figure 2).
PI3K is a heterodimeric protein with an 85-kDa regulatory
subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (PIK3CA).
PI3K serves to phosphorylate a series of membrane
phospholipids including PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2,
thereby forming the second messenger lipids PtdIns(3,4)
P2 (PIP2) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3). PIP3 then activates
the phosphotidylinositide-dependent kinases (PDKs)
which are responsible for activation of serine-threonine
kinase Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) (Figure 2). Once
activated, Akt leaves the cell membrane to phosphorylate
intracellular substrates, including caspase-9 [65], the
pro-apoptotic molecule BAD [66, 67], GSK-3β [68],
and kinase IκB (IKK) [69]. When these targets are
phosphorylated by Akt, they may either be activated or
inactivated (e.g. phosphorylated BAD is inactive), but
the final result is to promote cell survival. As well as
intracellular substrates, Akt is able to target a number of
transcription factors. In fact, after activation Akt is able
to translocate into the nucleus [70] where it affects the
activity of a number of transcriptional regulators, such as
cAMP response element-binding (CREB) [71], E2F [72,
73], NF-κB (via IKK) [69], and the forkhead transcription
factors [74-77].
Activated Akt positively modulates mTOR function.
mTOR phosphorylates components of the protein
synthesis machinery, such as the serine-threonine kinase
p70S6 (40S ribosomal protein kinase) and the translation
repressor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1
(4E-BP1), both regulating the translation of important
factors involved in cell proliferation (such as c-myc, cyclic
D1 and pRb) and angiogenesis (such as HIF1-α).
Negative regulation of the PI3K pathway is primarily

PTEN as a target in therapeutic approaches, at least for the
treatment of HCC caused by HBV infection.
Recent studies have demonstrated that mTOR
inhibition shows a remarkable activity against a wide
range of human cancers in vitro and human tumor
xenograft models. The mTOR pathway is known to be
upregulated in a subset of HCC patients [93]. In this
study 15% of HCC displayed overexpression of phosphomTOR, whereas 45% of HCC had increased expression
of p70 S6K, which correlated with tumor nuclear grade.
The importance of the mTOR pathway in HCC was
confirmed by Llovet’s group in a comprehensive study
with 314 HCC and 37 non-tumor tissues using a series
of molecular techniques to assess mutation, DNA copy
number changes, messenger RNA and gene expression,
as well as protein activation [94]. Aberrant activation of
mTOR signaling (p-RPS6) was present in half of the cases
and was associated with IGF pathway activation, EGF
up-regulation, PTEN dysregulation and chromosomal
gains in the rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR
(RICTOR) (25% of patients). Furthermore, positive
p-RPS6 staining correlated with HCC recurrence after
resection [94]. Overall, these data support efforts to target
mTOR signaling in liver cancer patients.
Taken together, these data suggest that the PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway may represent an important
therapeutic target for HCC treatment in patients with

differing etiologies that lead to the development of this
aggressive tumor.

IGFR PATHWAY
The IGF-I receptor (IGFR) signaling system consists
of circulating ligands – IGF-I and IGF-II – interacting
with a membrane receptor, such as type I IGF receptor
(IGF-1R). The IGF-1R is a heterotetramer consisting of
two extracellular ligand-binding α subunits and two β
subunits with transmembrane and TK domains (Figure 1).
Upon ligand binding IGF-1R undergoes conformational
changes and phosphorylation, leading to the recruitment
of insulin-receptor substrates (IRS) and/or Src homology 2
domain-containing (Shc) proteins, with the consequential
activation of pathways also common to EGFR, including
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR-axis and the Ras/MEK/ERKpathway (Figure 2).
Constitutive activation of the IGF-signaling axis is
frequently observed in a wide variety of tumors, including
HCC [95, 96]. The overexpression of IGF-II, IGF-1R,
and IRS contributes to cell proliferation and the inhibition
of apoptosis, as well as increasing invasive behavior in
HCC [97]. In HCC the reactivation of IGF-signaling
predominantly occurs at the level of IGF-II expression
[98, 99], but not of IGF-I. Overexpression of IGF-II has
been observed in 16-40% of human HCC and around

30% of HCC cases overexpress IGF-1R [99, 100]. IGF-II
overexpression is mainly due to altered methylation of the
IGF-2 gene promoters P1-P4 [101]. Furthermore, in HBVand HCV-associated HCC, the HBV-derived HBx protein
and HCV-derived core gene product have been reported
to facilitate IGF-II overexpression [102, 103]. Moreover,
in animal models of HCC the IGF signaling system also
seems to be responsible for the development of HCC
in obese and diabetic mice. Since obesity and diabetes
are clearly associated with an increased risk of cancer
in humans [104, 105], these observations highlighted
the pivotal role of IGF signaling system in these patient
categories.

to 40% of cases) [109, 113], whereas in HCC occurring
in HBV patients β-catenin activation is induced in a
mutation-independent manner by the expression of HBx
protein [114, 115]. However, in the absence of β-catenin
gene mutations, aberrant activation of β-catenin has been
identified in a significant subset of HCC patients with
mutations in axin1/2 (5%) [116]. The observation that
expression of the wild-type AXIN1 gene by adenovirus
mediated gene transfer induced apoptosis in HCC cells,
which had accumulated β-catenin as a consequence of
either APC, CTNNB1 or AXIN1 gene mutation, highlights
the fact that axin may be an effective therapeutic molecule
for suppressing HCC growth [116]. Recently, since axin
is the concentration-limiting component of the β-catenin
destruction complex, stabilization of axin by inhibiting
the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase 1 and
tankyrase 2 with small molecule inhibitor XAV939 has
been presented as a new avenue for targeted Wnt/β-catenin
pathway therapies [117].
Moreover, accumulation of β-catenin in human
HCC tumors containing the wild-type β-catenin gene
has been observed in the context of up-regulation of the
FZD7 receptor, which has been found up-regulated in
90% of human HCC [118-120], suggesting that FZD7
gene expression is the most common abnormality
observed in HCC and consequently activation of Wnt/
Frizzled-mediated signaling plays a key role in liver
carcinogenesis. Accordingly, Nambotin et al. demonstrated
that pharmacological inhibition of FZD7 displayed anticancerous properties against HCC in vitro (on a panel of
human HCC cell lines) and in vivo (on the SV40–TAg
transgenic mouse model of HCC) [121]. Therefore,
these observations suggest that the Wnt/β-catenin signal
transduction pathway is much more commonly involved
in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC than previously
recognized. Although no clinical studies are available,
a preclinical study in which β-catenin suppression was
achieved by antisense modalities has shown that β-catenin
is essential for the survival and growth of hepatoma
cells, independently of mutations in the β-catenin gene,
and therefore this provides a proof of principle for the
significance of the therapeutic inhibition of β-catenin in
HCC [122].

WNT/Β-CATENIN PATHWAY
The Wnt gene family encodes secreted glycoproteins
involved in cell growth, differentiation, organogenesis,
and oncogenesis. In a normal steady state (in the absence
of Wnt proteins) β-catenin, the central player in the
canonical Wnt pathway, is phosphorylated at aminoterminal serine and threonine residues by casein kinase
1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β).
β-catenin phosphorylation is facilitated by the scaffolding
proteins axin and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC).
Phosphorylated β-catenin is targeted for ubiquitination
and protein degradation by the proteasome (Figure 3).
Wnt signaling events are initiated by the binding of Wnt
proteins to the seven-pass transmembrane Frizzled (FZD)
receptor and the coreceptor low-density lipoprotein–
related protein (LRP) 5/6. Then, Dishevelled (Dvl) is
recruited to the FZD receptor, and the FZD/Dvl complex
subsequently relocates axin to LRP5/6. The recruitment of
axin to LRP5/6 is mediated by phosphorylation of LRP5/6
on key residues by the kinases CK1 and GSK-3β, which
ultimately leads to GSK-3β inactivation. The absence of
β-catenin phosphorylation releases it from the degradation
complex composed of APC, axin, GSK-3β and CK1,
resulting in an accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm,
since it cannot be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway. As a consequence, β-catenin translocates into
the nucleus where it binds to the lymphoid enhancer
factor (LEF) or T-cell factor (TCF) transcriptional
factors, displacing the transcriptional inhibitor Groucho,
and in complex with LEF/TCF activates the expression
of different genes which regulate cell proliferation and
apoptosis (Figure 3).
A role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCC was
discovered over a decade ago [106]. Activating mutations
in the β-catenin gene (CTNNB1) were found in different
human HCC cell lines and in HCC clinical samples in
around 20%-40% of all cases [106-112]. These mutations
impair the GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of the
protein at serine and threonine residues in its N-terminus
region. Intriguingly, HCC occurring in HCV patients
showed a high incidence of β-catenin gene mutations (up

HEDGEHOG PATHWAY
The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is essential for
embryonic development, tissue polarity and cell
differentiation [123-125]. This pathway is critical in
the early development of the liver and contributes to
differentiation between hepatic and pancreatic tissue
formation [126]. It remains inactive in healthy adult liver
tissue, except during tissue regeneration and remodeling
tissue repair, and Hh signaling may also play a role in
primary liver cancers, such as cholangiocarcinoma and
HCC [127, 128]. The Hh signaling pathway is complex
244

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 236-260

and requires two cellular receptors, Patched-1 (Ptch-1)
receptor and Smoothened (Smo), a 7-transmembranous
domains protein receptor. In the absence of ligand, Ptch1 represses Smo, thereby silencing the Hh signaling
pathway. Binding of the Hh ligands - Sonic Hedgehog
(Shh), Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh)
- to Ptch-1 liberates Smo from Ptch-1-mediated inhibition,
thus initiating the propagation of an intracellular
signaling cascade that leads to the activation and nuclear
translocation of glioma-associated oncogene homologue
(Gli) family transcription factors (Gli1, Gli2, Gli3)
which regulate the expression of Gli-target genes [129].
The different Gli proteins show activating or repressing
transcriptional activators depending on proteolytic
cleavage of the full-length proteins. Gli1 and Gli2 mainly
act as transcriptional activators, whereas in the absence or
inhibition of Hh signaling processing of Gli3 produces a
repressor form (Gli3R).
Hh has emerged as a critical mediator in the
development of various diseases, including cancer, when
aberrantly activated [130].
Although the study of Hh signaling in liver cells is in
its infancy, some studies have shown that activation of the
Hh pathway is involved in liver carcinogenesis [131-136].
Therefore, blockade of the Hh signaling pathway may be
a potential new therapeutic strategy in HCC.
The relevance of blocking the Hh pathway for HCC
treatment can be further supported by the evidence that this
pathway can cross-talk with the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway, a well-known oncogenic pathway implicated in
HCC development [137, 138]. Taken together, these data
suggest that inhibition of the Hh pathway may provide a
useful therapeutic option for the treatment of HCC.

IL-6 responses has been the identification of a soluble
form of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) [144]. When the
IL-6/sIL-6R complex associates with the membranebound signal-transducing chain, it can induce the signal
transduction cascade, acting as an agonist and stimulating
a variety of cellular responses including the proliferation,
differentiation and activation of inflammatory processes.
A large body of evidence has been accumulating
in recent years which indicates that IL-6 is involved in
liver carcinogenesis [143, 145]. In this line, Michael
Karin’s group showed that IL-6 participates in
hepatocarcinogenesis, using diethylnitrosamine (DEN)induced murine HCC models [146]. They also showed
that estrogen-mediated inhibition of IL-6 production by
Kupffer cells reduces liver cancer risk in females and these
findings not only may be used to prevent HCC in males,
but also may be a possible clue for the enigma of gender
difference in HCC occurrence found in epidemiologic
data [147]. Recently, a retrospective cohort study was
conducted to examine whether the results observed in
the mouse models were applicable to human HCC [148].
No significant difference in serum IL-6 levels was found
between female and male chronic hepatitis C patients.
Unexpectedly, in a multivariate analysis higher serum IL-6
level was an independent risk factor for HCC development
in female but not in male chronic hepatitis C patients.
Therefore, the gender disparity in liver carcinogenesis
in humans cannot be attributed solely to the difference
in IL-6 levels. Interestingly, a recent report suggested
that Foxa factors (Foxa 1 and Foxa2) and their targets
are central for the sexual dimorphism of HCC [149].
The mechanism of gender disparity remains to be further
investigated.
Nevertheless, many works have reported high serum
levels of IL-6 in various liver diseases, including HCC.
Serum IL-6 levels are significantly higher in patients with
HCC than in healthy individuals [150-152] and higher
levels of IL-6 have been correlated with tumor mass and
cancer invasiveness [150, 153]. Moreover, IL-6 is much
higher in stage III HCC patients than in stage I and II
patients [151]. As regards sIL-6R, although no significant
difference in sIL-6R levels were observed between control
subjects and patients with HCC, sIL-6R levels resulted
higher in patients with a more advanced stage of disease
[151, 154].
STAT3 is the major mediator of IL-6 and growth
factor (e.g. EGF, PDGF and HGF) signaling, transmitting
signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus. STAT3
activation requires phosphorylation of a critical tyrosine
residue (Tyr705), which mediates its dimerization, which
is a prerequisite for nucleus entry and DNA binding. The
phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 is most commonly
mediated by Janus kinases (JAKs), especially JAK2.
Activated STAT3 can mediate oncogenic transformation
in cultured cells and promote tumor formation in nude
mice, thus qualifying STAT3 as a proto-oncogene [155].

INFLAMMATORY PATHWAY (IL-6/STAT3,
TNF-α, NF-κB, COX-2)
The link between inflammation and cancer was
first suggested by Rudolph Virchow in 1863, and is now
a widely-accepted paradigm of carcinogenesis [139,
140]. Nowadays epidemiological data have undoubtedly
demonstrated a clear association between chronic
inflammation and tumor development, including HCC
[141-143]. Although the molecular mechanisms by which
chronic inflammation increases the risk of HCC are not
completely known, compelling evidence gathered over the
past few years has demonstrated the roles of inflammatory
factors, such as IL-6, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)/
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and tumor necrosis factor α
(TNF-α) in HCC development [142].
IL-6 mediates its diverse biological effects by
interacting with a receptor complex consisting of a
specific ligand-binding protein (IL-6R, gp80) and a
signal transduction protein (gp130) and regulates the
JAK/STAT3, Ras/MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways.
A key feature in our understanding of the regulation of

STAT3 is constitutively activated in human HCC tissues,
but not in adjacent non-tumor liver parenchyma or normal
liver tissue [156, 157]. A recent report demonstrated that
the STAT3 signaling pathway is very complex and may
participate in HCC genesis and development by regulating
the protein expression of other signaling pathways,
telomerase, apoptosis, the cell cycle and angiogenesis
[158]. Targeting STAT3 as a potential cancer therapy
has been extensively investigated [159], and recently
new small-molecule inhibitors have been developed
which show to inhibit IL-6-induced STAT3 activation
and nuclear translocation in HCC cells [160]. Therefore,
targeting IL-6/STAT3 seems to be a promising strategy for
HCC therapy.
An inducible enzyme with carcinogenic properties
that is active within inflamed and malignant tissues is
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The COX enzymes (COX-1
and COX-2) are well-known targets of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Many epidemiological
studies have demonstrated that treatment with
NSAIDs reduces the incidence and mortality of certain
malignancies, especially gastrointestinal cancer [161].
However, conventional NSAIDs non-selectively inhibit
both the constitutive form COX-1, and the inducible
form COX-2. Recent evidence indicates that COX-2 is
an important molecular target for anticancer therapies.
Its expression is undetectable in most normal tissues,
and is highly induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines,
mitogens, tumor promoters and growth factors. It is now
well-established that COX-2 is chronically overexpressed
in many premalignant, malignant, and metastatic cancers
[162], including HCC [163-165]. Overexpression of
COX-2 in patients with HCC is generally higher in welldifferentiated HCCs compared with less-differentiated
HCCs or histologically normal liver, suggesting that
COX-2 may be involved in the early stages of liver
carcinogenesis [163-165] and increased expression of
COX-2 in noncancerous liver tissue has been significantly
associated with postoperative recurrence and shorter
disease-free survival in patients with HCC [166, 167].
In tumors, overexpression of COX-2 leads to an increase
in prostaglandin levels, which affect many mechanisms
involved in carcinogenesis, such as angiogenesis,
inhibition of apoptosis, stimulation of cell growth as well
as the invasiveness and metastatic potential of tumor cells
[168].
The availability of novel agents that selectively
inhibit COX-2 (COXIB) has contributed to shed light on
the role of this molecule. Experimental studies on animal
models of HCC have shown that NSAIDs, including
both selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors, exert
chemopreventive as well as therapeutic effects [169-172].
However, the key mechanism by which COX-2 inhibitors
affect HCC cell growth is as yet not fully understood.
Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of molecular
targets other than COX-2 in the anti-proliferative effects of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

COX-2 selective inhibitors, including the MAPK cascade
[173, 174], PI3K/Akt pathway [175] and its upstream
kinase PDK-1 [176], the anti-apoptotic proteins survivin,
Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 [177, 178], cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitors and cyclins [179], as well as the sacroplasmic/
endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase SERCA [180].
Interestingly, COX-2-independent effects of celecoxib
have also been observed during liver carcinogenesis
in vivo. In the study by Marquez-Rosado [169] neither
COX-2 expression nor PGE2 production were altered by
celecoxib treatment, suggesting that celecoxib effects are
mediated by COX-2/PGE2-independent mechanisms.
Therefore, COX-inhibitors may use both COX2-dependent and COX-2-independent mechanisms to
mediate their antitumor properties [174, 181, 182],
although their relative contributions toward the in vivo
effects remain less clear.
Interestingly, celecoxib also inhibits IL-6/IL-6
receptor-induced JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation in human
HCC cells [183].
The NF-κB pathway has also been recognized
as an underlying link between inflammation and
malignancy [184]. The transcription factor NF-κB is a
ubiquitous transcription factor present in all cell types. In
unstimulated cells, NF-κB resides in the cytoplasm as a
heterotrimer consisting of p50, p65, and IκBα. The binding
of a ligand, such as cytokines or lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
to a receptor leads to the recruitment and activation of
an IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of IKKα
and/or IKKβ catalytic subunits and two molecules of
NEMO. Phosphorylation of serine residues of IκB
by IKK leads to IκB ubiquitination and subsequent
proteosomal degradation. p50 and p65 are then released
and translocated into the nucleus, where gene expression
is activated. Most genes linked with tumorigenesis
are regulated by NF-κB, such as those mediating
inflammation, cell survival, cell proliferation, invasion,
angiogenesis, and metastasis.
In recent years, several results have established
strong support for the critical role of NF-κB in many
types of cancer, including HCC [185, 186]. NF-κB is
aberrantly expressed and activated in both human HCC
tissue and HCC cells [187-189]. Several preclinical
studies have shown that inhibition of NF-κB signaling
by pharmacological or genetic approaches [189-192]
results in an antitumor effect in HCC, suggesting that
NF-κB is a potential molecular target for HCC therapy.
Worthy of note is the observation that celecoxib potently
inhibits the nuclear translocation and activation of NFκB by COX-2-dependent and -independent mechanisms
[169, 181, 193, 194]. Interestingly, we recently reported
that combination of celecoxib with the novel NF-κB
inhibitor dehydroxymethyl-epoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ)
synergistically inhibits cell growth, NF-κB p65 DNAbinding capacity, and cell proliferation in human HCC
cells [195], providing a rational basis for the clinical use
246

of this combination in the treatment of liver cancer.
The important role of inflammatory pathways in liver
carcinogenesis is further reinforced by recent studies by
Michael Karin’s team, published in Cell in 2010 [196].
Park et al. demonstrated that either dietary or genetic
obesity is a potent bona fide liver tumor promoter in mice.
Obesity-promoted HCC development was dependent on
the production of the tumor-promoting cytokines IL-6 and
TNF-α, which cause hepatic inflammation and activation
of the oncogenic transcription factor STAT3. The chronic
inflammatory response caused by obesity and enhanced
production of IL-6 and TNF-α ma also increase the risk
not only of HCC but of other cancers [105, 196].

time to progression (TTP), with a median of 5.5 months
in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo
group. On the basis of these findings, the FDA, European
Medicine Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities
in the world have approved sorafenib for advanced HCC
treatment. However, although sorafenib is well tolerated,
concern for its safety has been expressed. Most common
adverse events reported in the SHARP trial were diarrhea
and hand-foot skin reactions [211]. Sorafenib is currently
undergoing investigation in a phase III study - the
STORM trial - in HCC patients as an adjuvant therapy
for the prevention of recurrence following surgery
or local ablation (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT00692770).
In addition to sorafenib other molecular targeting
agents have been used in clinical trials for advanced
HCC treatment (Table 1). However, most of them have
demonstrated very low responses. The low response
rate associated with monotherapy indicates the need to
explore combinations of different molecular targeting
agents, but also combinations of a single agent with
conventional cytotoxic drugs. In this context, a phase
II trial demonstrated that the addition of sorafenib to
doxorubicin improves progression-free and overall
survival of patients with advanced HCC [212]. Moreover,
a phase II trial is currently recruiting patients to determine
the progression-free survival of sorafenib plus tegafur/
uracil (UFUR) for the treatment of advanced or metastatic
HCC (NCT00464919).
In addition to Raf inhibition, preclinical studies have
demonstrated the potential of MEK inhibition to suppress
hepatoma cell proliferation and tumorigenicity [44, 46,
213-216]. Huynh et al. recently reported that treatment of
human HCC xenografts with AZD6244 (ARRY-142886,
Selumetinib), a selective MEK inhibitor, blocked ERK1/2
activation, reduced in vivo tumor growth and induced
apoptosis [44]. Targeting MEK with the selective MEK
inhibitor PD0325901, a derivative of CI-1040, had in
vivo chemopreventive effects on HCC development
in an animal model employing TGF-α-transgenic
mice with liver cancers induced by diethylnitrosamine
treatment [217]. In addition, a combination of the MEK
inhibitor AZD6244 and the conventional cytostatic
drug doxorubicin enhanced the antineoplastic activity
of the respective monotherapeutic HCC treatment with
doxorubicin alone [218]. MEK inhibitors have also been
shown to potentiate the antitumor activity of selective
COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors in suppressing growth and
inducing apoptosis in human liver cancer cells [174].
Taken together, the in vitro and preclinical in vivo
data show that MEK inhibitors are promising agents for
HCC treatment. However, a multicenter phase II clinical
study failed to demonstrate a clinical benefit for AZD6244
as a single agent in patients with advanced HCC [219].
This result suggests that inhibition of MEK signaling
alone is not sufficient to successfully treat advanced-stage

OTHER POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC
TARGETS IN HCC
As stated above, during the multistep biological
process involved in the development of HCC several
genetic and epigenetic alterations occur and various
pathways are involved, including transforming growth
factor (TGF)-β [197], hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/
c-MET [198-200], Hyppo [201] and Notch [202, 203]
signaling. These molecules may represent critical
therapeutic targets for HCC intervention as well as for
other cancers.

MOLECULAR-TARGETED THERAPY IN
HCC
Several recent reviews have been published
describing in detail the results of clinical trials of
molecular-targeted agents for the treatment of HCC [204208]. Here, we briefly review only some of them, whereas
an updated list of data accessed up to February 2012 by
searching the clinicaltrials.gov website on ongoing clinical
trials in HCC patients is reported (Table 1).

The Raf kinase inhibitor sorafenib (Nexavar,
BAY43-9006) is currently the most promising molecular
targeting drug for HCC. Sorafenib, is a multikinase
inhibitor, which in addition to targeting Raf kinases
also inhibits VEGFR-2/-3, PDGFR-β, Flt-3 and c-Kit
[42, 209, 210] (Figure 1). On the basis of the recent
large randomized phase III study, the Sorafenib HCC
Assessment Randomized Protocol (SHARP), Sorafenib
has been approved by the United States (US) Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients
with advanced HCC [211]. In the SHARP trial median
overall survival (OS) increased from 7.9 months in the
placebo group to 10.7 months in the sorafenib group.
Sorafenib showed a significant benefit also in terms of

AZD6244 in HCC patients with less severe disease, i.e.
moderate liver dysfunction, and also in association with
sorafenib (Table 1).

Taken together, the in vitro and preclinical in
vivo data, as well as the clinical trials, conducted so far
demonstrate that mTOR inhibitors are promising agents
for HCC treatment, particularly in combination with
conventional chemotherapeutic drug therapy.

PI3K/AKT/MTOR

TARGETING THE VEGF/VEGFR, FGF/
FGFR AND PDGF/PDGFR PATHWAYS

The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway appears to be
one of the major contributors to the development and
maintenance of HCC. Although some preclinical studies
have demonstrated that PI3K inhibitors such as perifosine,
LY29004 and wortmannin have anti-HCC activity, no
studies have been conducted so far at the clinical level.
A phase II Study of MK-2206 (a novel oral potent
allosteric Akt inhibitor) in advanced HCC patients who
have not responded or are intolerant to one previous line
of anti-angiogenic therapy is currently recruiting patients
(NCT01239355). Of interest, a recent study showed that
the combination of sorafenib and MK-2206 overcomes
the resistance of HCC cells to sorafenib at clinically
achievable concentrations, suggesting the potential use of
this treatment in HCC patients [220].
Evidence from in vitro experiments, as well as from
preclinical in vivo data, indicated that mTOR inhibition
by rapamycin and its analogues everolimus (RAD001)
significantly reduced the growth of HCC cells and
improved survival primarily via antiangiogenic effects
[221-224].
A pilot study conducted on 21 patients with advanced
HCC indicated that sirolimus (rapamycin) was a promising
drug for the treatment of HCC and a randomized phase
I/II trial evaluating the rapamycin analog RAD001
(everolimus) for advanced HCC is currently recruiting
patients (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00516165).
Other clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate dose
limited toxicity and efficacy in advanced HCC patients
treated with the mTOR inhibitor Torisel (temsirolimus).
Furthermore, a phase I/II multicentre study to assess the
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary
efficacy of AZD8055, a novel ATP-competitive inhibitor
of mTOR kinase, is recruiting Asian patients with
advanced stage HCC (Table 1).
A topic of considerable current interest concerns
the signal transduction pathways and molecular
mechanisms linked to the chemoresistance of tumor
cells to conventional anticancer drugs. In this context,
a combination of rapamycin with the conventional
cytostatic drugs doxorubicin and vinblastine enhances the
antineoplastic activity of the respective monotherapeutic
HCC treatment with either doxorubicin or vinblastine
alone [225, 226].
In addition to studies on the combination of mTOR
inhibitors with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, two
phase I/II clinical studies are currently recruiting patients
with advanced HCC to determine the safety/toxicity

HCC is a hypervascular tumor mainly supplied by
the hepatic arteries and secretion by HCC cells, tumorinfiltrating inflammatory cells and hepatic stellate cells of
factors such as VEGF, bFGF, angiopoietins, PDGF and
others promotes the sprouting of new vessels from nearby
existing vessels.
VEGF, is one of the strongest stimulatory angiogenic
factors, and is up-regulated in most human tumors,
including HCC [227, 228]. In a recent systemic review
and meta-analysis study, the prognostic role of VEGF as
a predictor of survival in patients with treated HCC was
established [229]. High tissue VEGF levels predicted poor
overall (HR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.26-3.68) and disease-free
(HR=1.69, 95% CI: 1.23-2.33) survival. Similarly, high
serum VEGF levels predicted poor overall (HR=2.35, 95%
CI: 1.80-3.07) and disease-free (HR=2.36, 95% CI 1.763.16) survival. Therefore, the inhibition of angiogenesis
may represent a potential therapeutic target in HCC,
and many antiangiogenic agents are under evaluation in
clinical trials in HCC.
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized
monoclonal antibody against VEGF which has been used
either as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic
or other targeted agents in several clinical studies already
concluded in patients with advanced HCC [230-236],
whereas others are still recruiting patients (Table 1).
Overall, the concluded studies demonstrated that although
bevacizumab is a well-tolerated agent, the side effects
associated with its administration, including bleeding,
hypertension, proteinuria, and thromboembolic events,
warrant further evaluation.
Other multiple RTK inhibitors that target VEGF are
under investigation, including brivanib, linifanib (formerly
ABT-869), vandetanib, and pazopanib.
Recently, in a phase II trial brivanib, a selective dual
inhibitor of VEGF and FGF signaling, was evaluated as
a first-line therapy in patients with unresectable, locally
advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. The
study showed a median OS of 10 months. Brivanib was
generally well tolerated; the most common adverse effects
included fatigue, hypertension, and diarrhea [237]. Based
on these results a randomized, double-blind, multi-center
phase III study of brivanib versus sorafenib as first-line
treatment is currently testing the OS of patients with
advanced HCC who have not received prior systemic

therapy (NCT00858871), whereas another phase III trial,
the BRISK PS Study (Brivanib Study in HCC Patients
at Risk Post Sorafenib), is evaluating brivanib plus
best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC in
subjects with advanced HCC who have not responded or
are intolerant to sorafenib (NCT00825955).
Linifanib (ABT-869) is a novel orally active, potent
and selective inhibitor of the VEGF and PDGF receptor
tyrosine kinases. A phase II study on 44 patients with
advanced HCC showed a response rate of 7%, a median
PFS of 3.7 months and median survival of 9.3 months
[238]. This study concluded that linifanib is clinically
active in advanced HCC, with an acceptable safety profile.
On the basis of these results, a phase III study of linifanib
versus sorafenib is ongoing.
A phase II, placebo-controlled study of vandetanib
(ZD6474), which targets VEGFR, EGFR and RET
signaling, showed activity in patients with inoperable HCC
but failed to meet its primary aim of tumor stabilization
[239]. However, the PFS and OS results suggest that
vandetanib has clinical activity in this patient population
that may warrant further investigation.
Finally, a report from a phase I dose-ranging study of
pazopanib (GW786034), an oral inhibitor targeting VEGF,
PDGF and c-kit, showed evidence of antitumor activity
[240].

906) and monoclonal antibodies (such as IMC-A12 and
AVE-1642) targeting IGF signaling are under evaluation
in clinical trials in HCC patients (Figure 1 and Table 1).
Pre-clinical evidence obtained in vitro in HCC
cells showed that IMC-A12 decreased cell viability
and proliferation and blocked ligand-induced IGF1R activation. In vivo A12 delayed tumor growth and
prolonged survival, reducing proliferation rates and
inducing apoptosis [247]. Therefore, these data suggest
that IMC-A12 effectively blocks IGF signaling, thus
providing the rationale for testing this therapy in clinical
trials. Indeed, an initial phase I study of IMC-A12
(cituxumumab) yielded a partial response in HCC [248],
however a subsequent phase II study in patients with
advanced HCC showed that IMC-A12 is inactive as a
monotherapy in HCC [249].
AVE1642 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that
specifically blocks IGF-1R signaling. A phase I study
showed that AVE1642 can be safely combined with
active doses of sorafenib, and the pharmacokinetics of
both AVE1642 and sorafenib were not modified at the
concentrations tested. Interestingly, long-lasting disease
stabilizations were observed in most patients with
progressive disease [250].
Recently, OSI-906, a novel orally-efficacious
small-molecule dual IGF-1R/Insulin receptor (IR) kinase
inhibitor has been isolated and is being evaluated as a
therapeutic agent for HCC [251]. OSI-906 is currently
being tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled, doubleblinded phase 2 study of second-line treatment in patients
with advanced HCC after failure of first-line treatment
with sorafenib (NCT01101906; Table 1).

TARGETING THE EGFR PATHWAY
Another promising target in HCC is the EGFR
pathway. As mentioned above, EGFR and its ligand EGF
play an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Two
therapeutic approaches are currently being employed
in clinical trials in HCC patients, by using either a
monoclonal antibody neutralizing the EGFR (cetuximab)
or three small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the
EGFR (erlotinib, gefinitib and lapatinb). Overall, the
results have been disappointing. Indeed, in phase II clinical
trials in which erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib and cetuximab
were assessed in patients with advanced HCC response
rates (RR) varied in the range of 0%–9%, the median PFS
time reported was approximately 1.4–3.2 months and OS
ranged 6.2-13 months [241-244]. Consequently, several
ongoing clinical trials are combining EGFR inhibitors
with another therapeutic modality such as cytotoxic drugs
and other molecular-targeted agents [235, 236, 245, 246]
(Table 1).

CONCLUSIONS
The recent identification of several key molecular
pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of HCC has
led to the development of new targeted therapies for this
devastating disease. Targeting the various effectors of
these pathways with pharmacologic inhibitors may inhibit
HCC cell growth and angiogenesis. Several promising
novel anticancer agents are currently under investigation
for the treatment of HCC. Ongoing clinical trials are
offering hope to improve the progression-free survival of
patients with advanced HCC.
The specific action of the new molecular-targeted
agents minimizes the toxicity typical of systemic
chemotherapy, although attention needs to be paid to the
onset and management of side effects related to treatment
with these new agents.
Combination therapy with either conventional
cytotoxic drugs or another inhibitor which targets a
specific molecule in a different signal transduction
pathway is also a key approach for improving the
effectiveness and usefulness of new molecular-targeted
agents. This avenue of investigation has not been pursued

TARGETING THE IGF PATHWAY
Constitutive activation of the IGF-signaling axis
is frequently observed in HCC [95,96]. In HCC the
activation of IGF-signaling has antiapoptotic and growthpromoting effects and acts through multiple signaling
cascades, including the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways.
As for other pathways, small molecules (such as OSIwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as rigorously as it could be, often due to the conflicting
interests of the pharmaceutical companies, since different
companies will often have competing interests for the
different inhibitors/chemotherapeutic drugs. Nevertheless,
the field of molecular-targeted therapy in cancer therapy
has already come a long way. It is not hard to see an even
brighter future on the horizon. However, many additional
clinical trials, as well as the development of novel,
innovative approaches to cure or suppress the further
development of HCC need to be performed and developed
to improve therapy in HCC patients.
