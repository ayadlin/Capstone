to Oxidative Stress

Abstract
Quinolinic acid is a product of tryptophan degradation and may serve as a precursor for NADþ, an
important enzymatic cofactor for enzymes such as the DNA repair protein PARP. Pathologic accumulation of
quinolinic acid has been found in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer and Huntington disease,
where it is thought to be toxic for neurons by activating the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and
inducing excitotoxicity. Although many tumors including gliomas constitutively catabolize tryptophan, it is
unclear whether quinolinic acid is produced in gliomas and whether it is involved in tumor progression. Here,
we show that quinolinic acid accumulated in human gliomas and was associated with a malignant phenotype.
Quinolinic acid was produced by microglial cells, as expression of the quinolinic acid-producing enzyme 3hydroxyanthranilate oxygenase (3-HAO) was conﬁned to microglia in glioma tissue. Human malignant glioma
cells, but not nonneoplastic astrocytes, expressed quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) to use
quinolinic acid for NADþ synthesis and prevent apoptosis when de novo NADþ synthesis was blocked.
Oxidative stress, temozolomide, and irradiation induced QPRT in glioma cells. QPRT expression increased
with malignancy. In recurrent glioblastomas after radiochemotherapy, QPRT expression was associated with
a poor prognosis in two independent datasets. Our data indicate that neoplastic transformation in astrocytes
is associated with a QPRT-mediated switch in NADþ metabolism by exploiting microglia-derived quinolinic
acid as an alternative source of replenishing intracellular NADþ pools. The elevated levels of QPRT expression
increase resistance to oxidative stress induced by radiochemotherapy, conferring a poorer prognosis. These
ﬁndings have implications for therapeutic approaches inducing intracellular NADþ depletion, such as
alkylating agents or direct NADþ synthesis inhibitors, and identify QPRT as a potential therapeutic target
in malignant gliomas. Cancer Res; 73(11); 3225–34. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Constitutive catabolism of trp has been observed in various
types of cancers where it contributes to the suppression of
antitumor responses (1). Thus, this trp pathway driven by the
rate-limiting enzyme, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1),

has evolved as a therapeutic target in cancer-associated
immunosuppression and both cancer- and autoimmunemediated inﬂammation (2–6). Inhibitors of IDO-1 have
already entered clinical trials (7, 8). Others and we recently
showed that tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), which has
previously been described as liver and neuron speciﬁc, is
expressed in certain cancers (9) such as gliomas and constitutively generates kynurenine (kyn). Glioma cell-derived
kyn promotes tumor cell survival, motility, and immune
escape (10). Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of TDO
enhances the efﬁcacy of cancer vaccination in preclinical
models (11). Although kyn accumulates in glioma cell cultures, the downstream kyn catabolite quinolinic acid was
detectable in human glioma tissue (10) indicating that trp is
further catabolized in gliomas in situ, possibly by inﬁltrating
monocytic cells, which display the enzymatic ability to
convert trp and/or kyn to quinolinic acid (12). Quinolinic
acid accumulates in neurodegenerative and inﬂammatory
central nervous system (CNS) diseases and has chieﬂy been
studied as an endogenous ligand of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (13, 14) where it induces neuronal
loss through excitotoxicity (15). In contrast, monocytic cells,

such as macrophages and microglia, induced to catabolize
trp convert quinolinic acid to NADþ (12).
The capability to prevent hypoxia- or DNA damage-induced
cell death despite high proliferative activity is a crucial characteristic of cancer cells (16). NADþ plays a key role as a
substrate and cofactor maintaining cellular integrity under
these conditions. In cancer cells, NADþ is depleted by insufﬁcient NADþsynthesis and NADþ consumption by PARPmediated DNA repair or under hypoxic conditions (17). Therefore, deprivation of NADþ has evolved as a target in tumor cellspeciﬁc experimental therapies (18). For instance, pharmaceutical targeting of the de novo NADþ synthesis pathway by
FK866, an inhibitor of the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), sensitizes tumor cells for apoptosis and is
currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials in patients
with cancer (19–21). Although the results of therapeutic NADþ
depletion are promising, the effect of inhibiting NAMPT may be
compromised by the activity of quinolinic acid- and nicotinic
acid-dependent NADþsynthesis pathways. Both quinolinic
acid and nicotinic acid can serve as alternative substrates for
NADþ synthesis (22).
As induction of oxidative stress and consecutive NADþ
depletion are major effects of irradiation and alkylating agents
such as temozolomide, we set out to investigate the role of
quinolinic acid and the key enzyme for quinolinic acid usage,
quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), in human
glioma under oxidative stress induced by irradiation and the
alkylating agent temozolomide and to delineate the role of this
pathway in the resistance to these therapeutic approaches,
which constitutes a major problem in the therapy of these
tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
A172, LN-18, U87MG, LN-229, T98G, and LN-319 human
glioma cells and CRL-8621 human astrocytes were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; distributed by
LGC Standards) between 2007 and 2012. In addition to the
tandem repeat analyses at ATCC, cells were tested by multiplex
human cell authentication as part of a routine procedure in the
German Cancer Research Center (Heidelberg, Germany). The
last test was conducted in 2011. Human microglial cells were
purchased from Clonexpress. All glioma cells and astrocytes
were cultured in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle medium (DMEM;
Invitrogen), and microglia was incubated in DMEM:F12 (Invitrogen), each supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Quinolinic acid (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), FK866 (Axon Medchem), and nicotinic acid
(Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Roth).
A172 shQPRT cells were generated by transfection with the
Origene shQPRT vector (Origene). T325 glioma-initiating cells
were generated as described previously (23). HA1800 primary
astrocytes were obtained from ScienCell.
Western blot analysis
Twenty micrograms of protein diluted in NuPAGE sample
buffer and reducing reagent (Invitrogen) were denatured at

95 C for 5 minutes and electrophoretically separated on readyto-use 4% to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen)
at 1.5 mA/cm2 for 1.5 hour. After blocking in 0.5 mol/L Tris–
Base, pH 7.4, 5% milk powder, 1.5 mol/L NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20,
the membranes were incubated with anti-3-HAO (1:300;
Abnova), anti-QPRT (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-PARP
(1:300; Cell Signaling), anti-cleaved PARP (1:300; Cell Signaling), anti-caspase-3 (1:200; Cell Signaling), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:200; Cell Signaling), or anti-survivin (Cell Signaling)
antibody overnight at 4 C. Staining with anti-rabbit or antimouse secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies at dilutions of 1:4,000 (both Cell Signaling), was followed by
immunodetection with LumiGLO Chemiluminescent Substrate (KBL).
NADþ quantiﬁcation
Intracellular NADþ and NADH levels were measured using
the NADþ/NADþH Assay Kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, 250,000 cells were seeded and
harvested at the endpoint of the respective experiment. Pellets
were washed with cold PBS. Then, cells were extracted with
NADH/NADþ Extraction Buffer by 2 freeze/thaw cycles (20
minutes on dry ice, then 10 minutes at room temperature).
Total NADþ and NADH were detected following the instructions in a 96-well plate. Color reaction was read with a 450 nm
ﬁlter (BMG Omega reader; BMG Labtech).
Quinolinic acid quantiﬁcation
Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) was conducted to determine the levels of quinolinic acid and picolinic
acid in the supernatant of growing cells in culture. The GC/MS
method used for the analysis of picolinic acid and quinolinic
acid has been described previously (24). Brieﬂy, the internal
standards used were picolinic acid conjugated with deuterium
D4 picolinic acid and quinolinic acid conjugated with deuterium D3 quinolinic acid (Medical Isotopes). Protein in culture
supernatants was precipitated by the addition of an equal
volume of 10% trichloracetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:1) and
centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes. For the derivatization
procedure, standards and sample solutions (100 mL) were then
transferred to glass tissue culture vials (100  10 mm) with the
addition of 10 mL picolinic acid and 10 mL quinolinic acid
internal standards and then evaporated to dryness using the
SpeedVac. A total of 60 mL of triﬂuoroacetic anhydride (SigmaAldrich) and 60 mL of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaﬂuoro-2-propanol were
then added to the residues. The glass vials were then capped
and sealed immediately and heated at 60 C for 30 minutes to
produce the hexaﬂuoroisopropyl ester of the respective acids.
The ester products were then dissolved in 180 mL of toluene,
washed with 5% sodium bicarbonate (1 mL) and water (1 mL),
dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (500 mg), and transferred to autosampler vials before injection (1 mL) into the GC/
MS via 7683 Autosampler (Agilent). Standard solutions of
quinolinic acid and picolinic acid for calibration curves were
prepared from stock solutions. The ﬁnal concentrations of
unknowns were calculated by interpolation of the standard
curves.

Human tissue samples and immunohistochemistry
Sixty formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded glioma tissue samples and 2 cortex control tissues were obtained from the
Department of Neuropathology, Institute of Pathology, (Heidelberg, Germany) banked in the Department of Neuropathology, and administered by the tissue bank of the German
National Center for tumor diseases (Heidelberg, Germany)
tissue bank. Tissue analyses were approved by local and
national authorities. Sections cut to 3 mm were incubated and
processed with anti-QPRT, anti-3-HAO, anti-CD68, antiquinolinic acid (1:25; Abcam), or anti-GFAP (Dako) on a VentanaBenchMark XT immunostainer (Ventana Medical Systems).
The Ventana staining procedure included pretreatment with
cell conditioner 2 (pH 6) for 60 minutes, followed by incubation
with the primary at 37 C for 32 minutes. Incubation was
followed by Ventana standard signal ampliﬁcation, UltraWash,
counterstaining with one drop of hematoxylin for 4 minutes
and one drop of bluing reagent for 4 minutes. For visualization,
ultraViewUniversal DAB Detection Kit (Ventana Medical Systems) was used. QPRT expression was scored according to the
H-Score described by Bruna and colleagues (25). Quinolinic

Statistical analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel
2003 (Microsoft) or provided directly by the analysis tools of
the expression data platforms. Student t test (2 tailed) was
applied for analyses of 2 subsets or one-way ANOVA of larger
series. Survival data were analyzed by log-rank tests. P values <
0.03 were considered signiﬁcant, whereas P < 0.01 were highly
signiﬁcant. Immunoblot quantiﬁcation was conducted applying ImageJ version 1.44 (rsbweb.nih.gov). Statistical testing of
gene expression data obtained from the R2 platform (http://

High levels of quinolinic acid in gliomas correlated with the
expression of TDO (Fig. 1A and B) and were associated with a
malignant phenotype (Fig. 1A and C). These data indicated that
TDO-mediated trp catabolism not only promotes kyn accumulation (10) but also accumulation of quinolinic acid in
glioma tissue. As described previously (10), IDO-1 expression
in malignant gliomas was conﬁned to inﬁltrating leukocytes
and endothelial cells but largely absent in tumor cells (Supplementary Fig. S1E).
Quinolinic acid constitutes a NADþ salvage pathway in
gliomas and protects from stress-induced apoptosis
As quinolinic acid may serve as a precursor for NADþ (22),
which in turn may protect tumor cells from oxidative stress
(17), we next assessed the functional consequences of quinolinic acid for NADþ-mediated cytoprotection in malignant
gliomas. Blocking the de novo NADþ synthesis using the
NAMPT-inhibitor, FK866, signiﬁcantly reduced NADþ levels
in glioma cells and in nonneoplastic astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Viability of astrocytes but not glioma cells was
reduced by NAMPT inhibition alone, whereas FK866 treatment
strongly reduced cell viability in both astrocytes and glioma
cells subjected to oxidative stress induced by subtoxic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; Fig. 2A and B), indicating that both astrocytes and glioma cells require NAMPTmediated NADþ synthesis for the protection from oxidative

stress. Quinolinic acid restored cell viability induced by combined oxidative stress and NAMPT inhibition in glioma cells
(Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2A) but not in astrocytes (Fig.
2B and Supplementary Fig. S2B), indicating that glioma cells
speciﬁcally used quinolinic acid to replenish NADþ stocks. In
fact, NADþ levels in FK866-treated A172 cells increased by
addition of quinolinic acid (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Conversely, nicotinic acid restored cell viability in stressed and
NADþ-depleted astrocytes but not in glioma cells (Fig. 2A and
B and Supplementary Fig. S2). These data indicate that the
quinolinic acid-fed but not the nicotinic acid-fed NADþ salvage
pathway is active in gliomas, whereas astrocytes use the
nicotinic acid-fed rather than the quinolinic acid-fed salvage
pathway to protect themselves from the functional consequences of oxidative stress in conditions of reduced NADþ
availability. Quinolinic acid-mediated rescue of cell viability in
gliomas was associated with suppression of apoptosis as
evidenced by cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 and reduction
of survivin (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these data suggest that
malignant transformation of astrocytes is associated with a
switch from the nicotinic acid salvage pathway to the quinolinic acid salvage pathway to synthesize NADþ to protect
glioma cells from cell death induced by oxidative stress and
NADþ depletion. To address the effect of quinolinic acid in
response to current therapeutic settings, we analyzed the effect
of quinolinic acid supplementation to cells treated with

glioma cells (Fig. 2D). Quinolinic acid restored viability of
cells treated with temozolomide and FK866 (Fig. 2D), indicating that quinolinic acid accumulation in gliomas leads to
resistance to alkylating chemotherapy in NADþ-depleted
conditions.
QPRT is expressed in malignant gliomas and responsible
for NADþ synthesis
To identify the enzymatic requirements for quinolinic
acid-mediated protection of glioma cells, we analyzed the
expression of QPRT, the enzyme that is responsible for the
generation of NADþ from quinolinic acid. Glioma cells
express high levels of QPRT, whereas it is virtually absent
in astrocytes. In contrast, astrocytes show high expression of
nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), whereas
it is low to absent in glioma cells (Fig. 3A). These differences
in the expression of NADþ salvage pathway enzymes may

explain why glioma cells use the quinolinic acid pathway,
whereas nonneoplastic astrocytes rely on the nicotinic acid
pathway. To characterize QPRT expression in vivo, we analyzed human glioma tissue. QPRT was weakly expressed in
low-grade gliomas, whereas gliomas of higher malignancy
exhibited strong expression as detected by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3B and E). In line with the virtually
exclusive expression of NAPRT in nonneoplastic astrocytes
in vitro, staining of NAPRT was conﬁned to reactive astrocytes in glioma tissue and not observed in tumor cells (Fig.
3C). Analysis of expression data of World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2–4 glioma from the German Brain Tumor
Network (26) yielded higher levels of QPRT with increasing
malignancy (Fig. 3D). Moreover, Western blot analysis
showed higher QPRT expression in glioblastoma than in
low-grade glioma samples (Fig. 3F). Of note, no upregulation
of expression with malignancy was seen for NAPRT conﬁrming the immunohistochemistry data, which show that
NAPRT is conﬁned to nonneoplastic tissue (ref. 27; Supplementary Fig. S4).
QPRT protects glioma cells from oxidative stress and
confers an unfavorable prognosis
Our results indicate that QPRT expression is involved in
protecting gliomas from oxidative stress induced by alkylating agents. Thus, we evaluated whether cytoprotective QPRT
is upregulated by gliomas cells in response to oxidative
stress measures. Expression analyses by qRT-PCR showed
that temozolomide, irradiation, and H2O2 treatment dose
dependently induced the expression of QPRT (Fig. 4A). To
assess this effect on the protein level in vivo, we analyzed
matched pairs of tumor tissue resected before and after
radiochemotherapy. Tumor tissue resected after radiochemotherapy showed higher expression of QPRT compared
with samples before treatment (Fig. 4B; for patient characteristics see Supplementary Table S1). To analyze the
functional consequences of QPRT in gliomas, we generated
stable knockdown cells using short hairpin RNA (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Silencing of QPRT abrogated the protective effects of quinolinic acid from NADþ depletion in
gliomas cells (Fig. 4C). Biostatistical testing for correlation
between QPRT expression and survival based on REpository
for Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa (REMBRANDT;
rembrandt.nci.nih.gov) showed that high QPRT expression
in gliomas tissue is associated with an unfavorable prognosis
(Fig. 4D). Moreover, QPRT expression also stratiﬁes for
survival within the subgroup of patients with glioblastoma
in an independent dataset (ref. 28; Supplementary Fig. S6).
Collectively these data indicate that in gliomas, QPRT is
upregulated in response to oxidative stress imposed by

the presence of quinolinic acid using GC/MS (24). We used
glioma cells, which we have previously shown to catabolize trp
constitutively through the enzymatic activity of TDO (10).
Quinolinic acid is converted from the kyn metabolite 3-hydroxyanthranilate by 3-HAO (27). All but one trp-catabolizing
glioma cell line lacked 3-HAO expression explaining the inability of these cells to generate quinolinic acid (Fig. 5A). However,
Western blot analyses of glioma tissue revealed strong expression of 3-HAO in glioblastoma, but not in low-grade glioma
tissues (Fig. 5B). Glioblastomas are frequently inﬁltrated by
high numbers of microglial cells, which may account for almost
50% of the total cellular mass in these tumors and may promote
rather than inhibit tumor growth by various mechanisms (29).
Microglial cells have been shown to be capable of generating
quinolinic acid (30, 31). In line, microglia supernatant showed
the highest levels of quinolinic acid compared with glioma cells
and astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S7). Indeed, immunohistochemistry showed that 3-HAO is strongly expressed in cells
that also express the microglia marker CD68 (Fig. 5C). Immunoﬂuorescent double labeling conﬁrmed coexpression of the
microglia markers CD68 or CX3CR1, respectively, and 3-HAO
and colocalization of CD68þ and quinolinic acid in glioma

tissue (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S5B). To analyze the
inﬂuence of quinolinic acid-producing microglial cells, we used
primary human cultured microglia capable of generating
quinolinic acid (Supplementary Fig. S7). Quinolinic acid-containing microglial supernatant increased viability of QPRTproﬁcient but not QPRT-deﬁcient glioma cells in a NADþ
-depleted condition (Fig. 5E). These data indicate that microglial cells contribute to the resistance of gliomas to oxidative
stress induced by radiochemotherapy by converting gliomaderived kyn to quinolinic acid, which in turn is used by gliomas
cells to replenish depleted intracellular NADþ pools (Fig. 6).

Discussion
Resistance toward radiochemotherapy constitutes a major
problem in the therapy of malignant gliomas. Although irradiation plus concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with
temozolomide represents the standard of care for patients with
glioblastoma (32), resistance to these therapies is encountered
during primary therapy, particularly in elderly patients (33), or
in the recurrent setting despite considerable efforts to intensify
chemotherapeutic regimens with the aim at overcoming

primary or secondary resistance (34). Although the activities of
methyltransferases, particularly MGMT, have evolved as major
factors predicting response to alkylating agents in the primary
setting (35), the factors, which are induced by primary therapeutic measures and constitute resistance in the recurrent
setting beyond functional alterations in DNA mismatch repair
capabilities (36), are incompletely understood. We provide
here, evidence for a novel therapeutic pathway, which confers
resistance of malignant gliomas to radiochemotherapy involving the synthesis of NADþ from quinolinic acid via QPRT, an
enzyme that is induced in recurrent malignant gliomas and
associated with poor prognosis in these tumors (Figs. 3B
and 4D and Supplementary Fig. S6). The main ﬁnding of this
study is that microglial 3-HAO activity in gliomas is capable of
providing the NADþ precursor quinolinic acid, which confers
resistance to oxidative stress as invoked by, for instance,
irradiation or temozolomide. These results suggest that microglial cells contribute to the chemo- and radio-resistant phe-

notype of gliomas. Previous studies reported correlation of
microglial invasion with aggressiveness and poor prognosis in
gliomas by releasing growth promoting, angiogenic, and
immunosuppressive factors (37–40). Our results suggest that
inﬁltrating microglial cells may shape the tumor microenvironment to not only negatively inﬂuence the natural course of
disease but also the response to therapy. The mechanism
involved in this host-mediated resistance pathway involves
the catabolism of the essential amino acid trp. Trp metabolism
has thus far chieﬂy been viewed as a metabolic pathway used
by various types of cancer to suppress antitumor immune
responses (18). A measure of catabolic activity of cancerderived IDO-1 or TDO has consistently been the depletion of
trp and the accumulation of kyn, both of which, through the
activation of amino acid starvation and receptor-mediated
pathways, respectively, result in suppression of T-cell
responses (10, 41). However, it has long been known that
metabolites further downstream of kyn, such as kynurenic

acid, 3-hydroxy-kynurenine, and 3-hydroxy-anthranilic acid,
may suppress T-cell immunity (6, 42, 43). Here, we explored the
relevance of trp catabolism in malignant gliomas beyond
immunoactive metabolites and addressed the relevance of
quinolinic acid for stress resistance. Quinolinic acid has previously mainly been studied as a neurotoxin accumulating in
the CNS of patients with neurodegenerative diseases where it
causes excitotoxicity by binding and activating the NMDA
receptor (44–47). Its physiologic relevance as a NADþ precursor has received much less attention possibly because it has
been viewed as a less relevant NADþ synthesis pathway
compared with the de novo NADþ synthesis pathway through
NAMPT or the NADþ-recycling pathway through NAPRT.
However, tryptophan catabolism appears in principle capable
of replenishing depleted intracellular NADþ stores and protecting cells from oxidative stress as evidenced by in vitro
studies (48–51). These studies also showed that nicotinic acid
is a preferred route of NADþ synthesis in murine astrocytes in
line with our ﬁndings in human cells and tissue (50). Our results
indicate the speciﬁc capability of glioma cells to use the trp
metabolite quinolinic acid as a NADþ precursor, whereas
nonneoplastic astrocytes use nicotinic acid. Although we did
not detect QPRT in 2 independent astrocyte cells, previous
studies found strong induction of QPRT and subsequent
degradation of quinolinic acid in cultured astrocytes in
response to tryptophan metabolites and proinﬂammatory
cytokines (52).
The enrichment of quinolinic acid-metabolizing QPRT in
glioma cells (Fig. 3A), its induction by radiochemotherapeutic
treatment measures (Fig. 4A and B), and its association with
higher malignancy and poor prognosis in gliomas (Figs. 3B and
D and 4D) signify its biologic relevance as opposed to the
nicotinic acid-metabolizing NARPT, which is conﬁned to
reactive astrocytes (Fig. 3C), not associated with malignancy
(Supplementary Fig. S4), and not speciﬁc for neoplastic glial
cells (Fig. 3A). It is tempting to speculate that malignant
transformation and therapeutic measures such as radiation

3232

therapy and (alkylating) chemotherapy result in nicotinic acid
depletion in the tumor microenvironment, which in turn
induces a selection pressure for tumor cells capable of using
quinolinic acid as an alternative source of NADþ. Still, this
switch relies on the presence of inﬁltrating microglial cells as a
provider of quinolinic acid. Studies in monocytic cells including microglial cells have indicated their capability of accumulating quinolinic acid after induction of IDO-1 by inﬂammatory
mediators (12, 53, 54). Our results indicate that glioma cells
themselves are not capable of metabolizing tryptophan to
quinolinic acid as they lack the key enzyme 3-HAO (Fig. 5A
and B). Hence, local inﬂammation may create an environment
in the tumor, which results in the attraction and activation of
quinolinic acid-producing microglial cells, may enable trpmetabolizing tumor cells to defend themselves from oxidative
stress. In this respect, the function of microglial cells may be
similar to neurodegenerative diseases where quinolinic aciddegrading microglial cells seem to prevent neurotoxicity (55).
In addition to suppressing antitumor immune responses and
promoting cell survival and cell motility, trp metabolism may
thus also constitute a novel metabolic mechanism to confer
resistance of tumor cells to radiochemotherapy. This metabolic pathway may explain why NADþ-depleting agents, such
as FK866, are of limited efﬁcacy in some tumors such as
malignant gliomas and neuroblastomas, where quinolinic acid
has been shown to be proproliferative (56, 57). The resistance
mechanism, as suggested by our data, seems to be regulated at
the level of QPRT, which is why this enzyme may be a novel
therapeutic target in malignant gliomas. Of note, association of
high QPRT expression and unfavourable clinical course is not
limited to glioma but also indicated by expression data from
acute myeloid leukemia (58). Although currently available
substances, which inhibit QPRT, such as phtalic acid, are
unspeciﬁc, the rational design of QPRT inhibitors may lead
to a novel pharmacologic approach to target resistance of
tumors to radiochemotherapy.
