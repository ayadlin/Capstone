BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the tolerability and antitumor activity of AMG 386, a peptibody (a peptide Fc fusion)
that neutralizes the interaction of angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 with Tie2 (tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and
EGF-like domains 2), plus sorafenib in patients with clear cell metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) in a randomized controlled
study. METHODS: Previously untreated patients with mRCC were randomized 1:1:1 to receive sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily plus
intravenous AMG 386 at 10 mg/kg (arm A) or 3 mg/kg (arm B) or placebo (arm C) once weekly (qw). Patients in arm C could receive
open-label AMG 386 at 10 mg/kg qw plus sorafenib following disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free
survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were randomized. Median PFS was 9.0, 8.5, and 9.0 months in arms A, B, and C,
respectively (hazard ratio for arms A and B vs arm C, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-1.30; P ¼ .523). The objective response
rate (95% CI) for arms A, B, and C, respectively, was 38% (25%-53%), 37% (24%-52%), and 25% (14%-40%). Among 30 patients in arm
C who had disease progression and subsequently received open-label AMG 386 at 10 mg/kg qw, the objective response rate was
3% (95% CI, 0%-17%). Frequently occurring adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea (arms A/B/C, 70%/67%/56%), palmar-plantar
erythrodysesthesia syndrome (52%/47%/54%), alopecia (50%/45%/50%), and hypertension (42%/49%/46%). Fifteen patients had
grade 4 AEs (arms A/B/C, n ¼ 3/7/5); 4 had fatal AEs (n ¼ 2/1/1), with 1 (abdominal pain, arm B) considered possibly related to AMG
386. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mRCC, AMG 386 plus sorafenib was tolerable but did not significantly improve PFS compared

Upregulation of proangiogenic factors in response to inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene is a critical component in the development and progression of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC).1 Several inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with metastatic
RCC (mRCC).1 However, because almost all patients ultimately develop resistance to therapy, combination treatment
strategies that may result in more complete angiogenesis inhibition are of interest.2
The angiopoietin-1/angiopoietin-2 and Tie2 (tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 2)
receptor axis may be a legitimate target for inhibiting angiogenesis in mRCC. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that
its components are regulated by VHL and are dysregulated in RCC cell lines.3 Plasma angiopoietin-2 concentrations are
significantly elevated in patients with mRCC (compared with localized disease or healthy controls), and increase at the
time of disease progression.4 Concurrent blockade of the angiopoietin and VEGF pathways augments inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth in tumor xenograft models.5 Hence, combinations of angiopoietin/Tie2 inhibitors and VEGF
inhibitors might induce clinically meaningful activity.

AMG 386 Plus Sorafenib in Renal Cell Cancer/Rini et al

AMG 386 is an investigational recombinant peptide-Fc fusion protein that neutralizes the receptor-ligand
interaction between Tie2 and angiopoietin-1/2.5 In
Colo205 xenograft models, simultaneous antagonism of
angiopoietin-1/2 with AMG 386 suppressed tumor
growth more effectively than did selective inhibition of
angiopoietin-1 or angiopoietin-2 alone.5 Interim results
of a phase 1b study suggested that treatment of patients
who have mRCC with sorafenib or sunitinib plus AMG
386 had an acceptable toxicity profile, distinct from that
of VEGF inhibitors, and may have antitumor activity.6
We evaluated in a phase 2 study the tolerability and antitumor activity of AMG 386 plus sorafenib in previously
untreated patients who have clear cell mRCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Eligible patients (18 years) had previously untreated,
histologically confirmed mRCC with a clear-cell component; good/intermediate risk per Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic classification;
1 unidimensionally measurable lesion per Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version
1.0; complete radiologic assessment and tumor measurement 28 days before randomization; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1; had not
received systemic therapy for mRCC; and had adequate
hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. Key exclusion
criteria were unresected primary tumor; history of brain
metastases; arterial or venous thrombosis within 6
months; bleeding diathesis or significant bleeding within
14 days; uncontrolled hypertension (>90/>150 mm
Hg); focal radiation within 14 days or radiation-induced
toxicity; and ongoing pancreatitis. Patients provided written, informed consent. Study procedures were approved
by an institutional review board or independent ethics
committee.
Study Design and Treatment

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
phase 2 study was conducted at 41 centers in North America and Europe. Patients received sorafenib 400 mg orally
twice daily (bid) and were randomly assigned 1:1:1 using
an interactive voice response system to also receive AMG
386 at 10 mg/kg qw (arm A) or 3 mg/kg qw (arm B), or
placebo qw (arm C), by intravenous infusion over 30 to
60 minutes. Randomization was stratified by MSKCC
risk (good versus intermediate). Treatment continued
until disease progression, clinical progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Investigators and patients were blinded
Cancer

to treatment assignments until disease progression. After
disease progression and unblinding, patients in arm C
who continued to meet eligibility criteria could choose to
receive open-label AMG 386 at 10 mg/kg qw plus sorafenib. Doses of AMG 386 could be withheld and doses of
sorafenib could be withheld/modified per protocol-specified rules. Dose modifications for AMG 386 were not
permitted.
Study Endpoints

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS)
per investigator assessment defined as the time from randomization to disease progression per RECIST or death.
Independent centralized radiologic review (RadPharm,
Princeton, NJ) to confirm PFS and objective response rate
(ORR) was a protocol-specified option. Secondary endpoints included: overall survival (time from randomization to death), ORR, duration of response, change in
tumor burden, incidence of adverse events (AEs), antiAMG 386 antibody formation, and pharmacokinetics
(AMG 386 and sorafenib). Pharmacodynamic biomarkers
were exploratory endpoints.
Assessments

Disease status and progression according to RECIST version 1.0 was assessed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
every 8 weeks and during long-term follow-up of patients
who discontinued treatment before disease progression.
Follow-up was up to 48 months after randomization.
All AEs occurring from randomization to safety follow-up were recorded, classified, and graded according to
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.
Anti-AMG 386 antibodies and AMG 386
concentrations in the serum were analyzed using previously described techniques.7 Plasma sorafenib concentrations were determined using a validated liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method.
Serum concentrations of pharmacodynamic biomarkers
were assessed by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay or multiplexed sandwich immunoassays as
described.8
Statistical Analysis

The intent of the primary statistical analysis was to estimate the treatment effect on PFS of AMG 386 (at 2
doses) combined with sorafenib compared with placebo
plus sorafenib. A minimum of 150 patients were needed
for a hypothesized AMG 386/placebo PFS hazard ratio
(HR) of 0.79 and a 2-sided 80% confidence interval
(CI) with a maximum half-width of 0.23 (comparing

arms A and B combined versus arm C) to generate estimates of the treatment effect. The primary analysis was
planned at 113 PFS events. The study had approximately 49% power for a 2-sided 20% significance level
log-rank test of the treatment effect for arms A and B
versus arm C (HR for PFS of 0.79).
Efficacy endpoints were analyzed for the intent-totreat population. Analyses of AEs included all randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of AMG 386
or sorafenib. The Cox regression model stratified by
MSKCC risk was used to estimate HRs and 2-sided
80% and 95% CIs (calculated post facto) for comparisons between treatment arms. Tarone’s test stratified by
MSKCC risk was used to descriptively assess increasing
trends in PFS among the treatment arms. Kaplan-Meier
estimates for the medians for PFS and overall survival
were derived according to a previously described
method.9 Exact binomial 95% CIs were calculated for
ORR. Wilson’s score method with continuity correction
6154

was used to calculate 95% CIs for the differences in
ORR between arms.
RESULTS
Patients

Between May 2007 and November 2008, 152 patients
were randomized (arms A/B/C, n ¼ 50/51/51) and
received at least 1 dose of treatment; 1 patient
randomized to placebo (arm C) withdrew from the
study before having received any treatment. Demographics and baseline clinical characteristics were generally consistent across treatment arms (Table 1).
However, the proportion of patients with >3 sites of
metastasis (arms A/B/C, 22%/24%/12%) was higher
and the sum of longest diameters of target lesions was
greater among patients randomized to AMG 386,
compared with those receiving placebo.
At the time of analysis, 19 patients continued to
receive treatment (arms A/B/C, n ¼ 9/6/4; Fig. 1). The

most common reasons for treatment discontinuation
were disease progression and AEs. Patients in arms A, B,
and C received a median (range) of 35 (2-108), 31 (1115), and 34 (2-101) infusions of AMG 386 or placebo,
respectively. The overall median (range) follow-up time
was 75 (1-124) weeks. Thirty patients in arm C received
open-label AMG 386 (10 mg/kg qw) after disease progression, 11 of whom continued to receive AMG 386 at
the time of analysis.
Efficacy

At the analysis cutoff time, 34 patients in arm A, 38 in
arm B, and 39 in arm C have had disease progression. Median PFS time was similar across treatment arms (9.0, 8.5,
and 9.0 months in arms A, B, and C, respectively; Fig. 2).
The HR for arms A and B combined versus arm C was
0.88 (95% CI, 0.60-1.30; P ¼ .52). There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship across the 3 treatment arms (Tarone’s test, P ¼ .195). A protocol-specified
sensitivity analysis that used an independent centralized
read of all images showed a median PFS of 9.0 months
(95% CI, 5.4-15.0 months) in arm A, 9.0 months (5.414.4 months) in arm B, and 7.2 months (5.4-12.8
months) in arm C. Eleven months after the primary analysis, 38% of patients in arm A, 45% in arm B, and 55% in
Cancer

December 15, 2012

arm C had died. Interim median (95% CI) overall survival was 29.2 months (22.2-NE [not estimable]) in arm
B and 27.1 months (19.7-NE) in arm C but was not yet
reached in arm A (95% CI, 24.3-NE).
The confirmed ORR in arms A, B, and C was 38%,
37%, and 25%, respectively (Table 2). The confirmed
ORR per independent radiologic review in arms A, B, and
C was 22%, 22%, and 18%, respectively. The mean maximum reduction from baseline in the sum of longest diameters of target lesions was 34.3% in arm A, 29.2% in
arm B, and 23.8% in arm C.
Open-Label AMG 386

Thirty patients in arm C received open-label AMG 386 at
10 mg/kg qw plus sorafenib after disease progression. One
patient, who had a best response of stable disease during
the blinded study period, achieved a partial response with
a 40% reduction in tumor burden (small-volume lung
metastases) after initiation of open-label treatment. Seventeen (57%) patients achieved stable disease and 11
(37%) had progressive disease after crossover; 31% of
patients had some reduction in tumor burden. Among the
30 crossover patients, 6 initially had had partial responses
during the blinded study period with median (range)
reductions in tumor burden of 45% (39%-48%). Of
those, 5 achieved stable disease after open-label treatment

the exception of 1 grade 3 event in arm A). Three patients
had gastrointestinal perforations (Table 3). A grade 3 anal

There were 34 on-study deaths; most were
attributed to disease progression (arms A/B/C, n ¼ 7/

(cardiopulmonary failure and sudden death) and 1
each in arm B (abdominal pain considered possibly
related to AMG 386) and arm C (general physical
health deterioration). Serious AEs occurred in 36%,
49%, and 28% of patients in arm A, B, and C,
respectively. Those that were reported in 3 patients
who received AMG 386 at either dose included myocardial infarction (arm A/B/C, n ¼ 3/2/2), abdominal

pain (n ¼ 0/3/0), and pyrexia (n ¼ 1/2/0). The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment
because of AEs were 12%/18%/8%.
Among patients with available postbaseline immunoassay samples, 3 of 96 receiving AMG 386 and 3 of
46 receiving placebo developed anti–AMG 386 binding
antibodies. In each treatment group (AMG 386 versus
placebo), 2 patients had transient anti–AMG 386 antibodies (ie, the assay was negative at the last time point
tested). No AMG 386–neutralizing antibodies were
detected during the study.
Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers

Eight serum biomarkers were tested; pharmacodynamic changes are shown for 5 biomarkers (Fig. 3).
Placental growth factor (PLGF) was notably increased
above baseline in all 3 treatment arms, with the largest increase seen in arms A and B, suggesting an additive effect of AMG 386. Soluble vascular cell
adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) showed a similar
6158

but less pronounced response pattern, specifically at
early time points. Pharmacodynamic changes in soluble VEGF receptor 2, VEGF, and soluble Tie2 were
small in magnitude regardless of treatment. Levels of
serum soluble VEGF receptor 1, soluble Kit, and
soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1)
did not change with treatment (data not shown).
Pharmacokinetics

AMG 386 had dose-proportional pharmacokinetic properties, and Cmin and Cmax were comparable to the phase 1
monotherapy study,7 except for Cmin values at 10 mg/kg.
In the 3 mg/kg arm, median AMG 386 Cmax and Cmin
values were 81.0 and 6.85 lg/mL, respectively (week 5),
and 88.3 and 9.52 lg/mL, respectively (week 9). In the 10
mg/kg arm, median AMG 386 Cmax and Cmin values were
284 and 24.3 lg/mL, respectively (week 5), and 295 and
30.7 lg/mL, respectively (week 9). The median values of
sorafenib Cmin at week 5 were 6.91, 5.97, and 8.69 lg/
mL in arms A, B, and C, respectively.

DISCUSSION
In this estimation study of previously untreated
patients, sorafenib plus AMG 386 was tolerable without evidence of pharmacokinetic interactions, and
there was no enhanced treatment effect as measured
by PFS. However, there appeared to be an effect on
ORR and tumor burden with AMG 386 treatment,
particularly with 10 mg/kg qw dosing. Among
the 30 patients in the placebo arm who elected to
receive AMG 386 at 10 mg/kg qw after disease progression, 1 patient (3%) demonstrated an objective
response and 31% had a reduction in tumor
burden. These results suggest that mRCC treatment
strategies incorporating dual inhibition of angiopoietin/Tie2 and VEGF signaling pathways may be
feasible.
Both median PFS (9.0 months) and ORR (25%)
in the placebo plus sorafenib arm were higher than
reported in a randomized phase 2 study of first-line
treatment of RCC with sorafenib or interferon
alpha,10 as well as in a phase 211 and a phase 3
study12 of previously treated patients receiving sorafenib (median PFS times, 5-6 months; ORR, 5%-10%).
However, one other study group reported phase 2
results similar to ours (median PFS, 7.39 months;
ORR, 30%).13 In subsequent independent radiologic
review of our own study data, median PFS and ORR
in the placebo plus sorafenib arm remained higher
(7.2 months and 18%, respectively) than most of the
reported historical data. It is notable that some baseline disease characteristics were imbalanced across
arms, a chance consequence of small study size. Specifically, the proportion of patients with >3 metastatic
sites was greater among those randomized to AMG
386, as was baseline tumor burden. Whether this may
have affected the PFS outcome is unknown. Alternatively, outcomes in arm C may simply be a result of
the small study size. The efficacy of sorafenib as
monotherapy in the first-line setting is currently being
assessed in 2 phase 3 studies (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT00678392, NCT01030783).
Toxicities in our study were consistent with those
anticipated for AMG 386 and sorafenib as monotherapy. The incidence and severity of specific AEs that
have previously been reported with AMG 386 treatment, such as peripheral edema and proteinuria, were
consistent with that described in earlier studies.7,14,15
Dose-related trends in toxicity were not apparent.
Adverse events known to occur among mRCC patients
receiving sorafenib10-12 (including hypertension, rash,
Cancer

and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome) were
balanced across the treatment arms. Gastrointestinal
perforations have been previously reported with sorafenib16,17 and other VEGF pathway inhibitors in
mRCC.18-20 In this study, 1 placebo-treated and 2
AMG 386–treated patients (both received 10 mg/kg
qw) had gastrointestinal perforations (ie, anal fistulae
or abscesses). Four patients had fatal AEs; 3 received
AMG 386 treatment, but only 1 AE (abdominal pain,
arm B) was considered possibly related to AMG 386.
Recent phase 1 studies have reported exacerbated toxicity in patients with mRCC receiving combinations
of 2 VEGF pathway inhibitors, such as bevacizumab
plus sunitinib21 or bevacizumab plus sorafenib,22 suggesting that extensive blockade of VEGF signaling
may not be tolerable in this setting. Our phase 2
study shows that concomitant administration of the
angiopoietin-1/2 inhibitor AMG 386 and sorafenib
appears feasible. This is consistent with early data
from a phase 1b study that tested AMG 386 plus sorafenib or sunitinib in mRCC.6
Two of the circulating biomarkers we analyzed
underwent notable pharmacodynamic changes. Increases
from baseline in PLGF and sVCAM-1 were greater in
the AMG 386 plus sorafenib arms compared with placebo (plus sorafenib), suggesting an additive effect of
AMG 386 on these markers. Both PLGF and sVCAM-1
have important roles in tumor angiogenesis and have
been proposed as potential prognostic markers for outcome.23,24 VCAM-1 is highly expressed in endothelial
cells, is up-regulated in immune-resistant RCC cell lines,
and is also thought to be involved in immune escape.25
Levels of sVCAM-1 have been shown to increase in
RCC patients receiving sunitinib26 and in breast cancer
patients receiving bevacizumab.27,28 Further investigation will be required to establish clinical utility of these
pharmacodynamic markers.
AMG 386 pharmacokinetics showed that median
Cmin values in the 10 mg/kg arm at week 5 and subsequent time points were approximately 2-fold higher than
those reported in the phase 1 monotherapy study,7 which
was confirmed using population pharmacokinetics modeling (data not shown). These results suggest slightly
higher AMG 386 exposure in patients with RCC, consistent with the hypothesis that AMG 386 may be, at least in
part, cleared through the kidney, because creatinine clearance is significantly associated with AMG 386
clearance.29
The study was limited by its small size, chosen to
provide an estimate of efficacy as measured by PFS; it was

not designed to formally compare outcomes across study
arms. AMG 386 was only tested at a dose of up to 10 mg/
kg qw; however, the possibility that higher doses might
improve outcomes, as suggested by an exposure-response
analysis of the AMG 386 phase 2 ovarian cancer
study,15,29 cannot be excluded. AMG 386 at doses up to
15 mg/kg qw in combination with sunitinib (a standardof-care therapy in mRCC) is currently being investigated
in a phase 2 open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov,
NCT00853372).
In summary, AMG 386 plus sorafenib was tolerable.
The effect of treatment on PFS was estimated to be similar
in the AMG 386 and placebo arms. Results for ORR and
tumor burden reduction with AMG 386 treatment were
encouraging and suggestive of antitumor activity. Outcomes among patients randomized to placebo plus sorafenib who received AMG 386 plus sorafenib after disease
progression may provide insight into resistance to VEGF
receptor inhibitor therapy in mRCC.
