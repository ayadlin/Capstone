Abstract
Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ)
and yes-associated protein (YAP) are equivalently placed downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway with oncogenic roles in
human cancers. However, the expression proﬁles of TAZ/YAP
differ depending on the cancer cell type, suggesting that these
proteins have different roles during cancer progression, yet no
studies have examined the biologic signiﬁcance of the balance
between TAZ and YAP expression levels. Here we examined the
functional roles of TAZ/YAP in hepatocellular carcinoma progression. We found that TAZ, but not YAP, was predominantly
expressed in HCC. TAZ knockdown under normal conditions
attenuated cell growth in HCC cells; however, TAZ knockdown
combined with 5-ﬂuorouracil treatment signiﬁcantly increased
chemoresistance compared with control cells. Notably, TAZ
knockdown induced compensatory YAP expression and was

accompanied by upregulation of CD90, a HCC–speciﬁc cancer
stem cell marker. Continuous treatment with 5-ﬂuorouracil
also induced YAP expression and promoted tumor formation
in vivo. Conversely, double knockdown of TAZ/YAP reduced
chemoresistance and tumorigenicity. Moreover, YAP knockdown aggravated HCC cell growth to a greater degree than
TAZ knockdown, and YAP overexpression was strongly associated with poor prognoses in patients with HCC. Collectively,
these studies demonstrate that TAZ and YAP exhibit different
functional roles in cancer progression, and a shift to predominant YAP expression upon TAZ depletion conferred cancer
stem cell–like properties including chemoresistance and
tumorigenicity in HCC. Therefore, targeting of both TAZ/YAP
will be required for a complete antitumor response in HCC.

Introduction

threonine kinase (MST) 1/2 in mice, induce the hyperactivation
of Hippo downstream effectors, such as transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and yes-associated protein
(YAP), and result in liver outgrowth and the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; refs. 5–7). This is consistent
with results obtained in YAP overexpression transgenic mice
(8). Several studies have demonstrated the overexpression of
TAZ or YAP in human cancers, including HCC (9–17). Thus,
accumulating evidence has suggested that TAZ/YAP have oncogenic roles in human cancers, supporting the potential applications of pharmacologic inhibitors of TAZ or YAP activity in
anticancer therapy. However, although TAZ and YAP are equivalently placed as downstream effectors in the Hippo pathway, it
is unclear whether they have similar or different functional
roles in cancer progression.
In the current study, we found that the expression proﬁles of
TAZ and YAP differed among various types of gastrointestinal
cancer, suggesting that these proteins may have different functional roles during cancer progression. However, the relevance
of the balance between TAZ and YAP expression and the
biologic signiﬁcance of this balance during cancer progression
are unknown.
In this work, we aimed to investigate the functional roles of TAZ
and YAP and their interaction during cancer progression in HCC,
which typically develop following breakdown of the Hippo
pathway.

Contact inhibition of proliferation is crucial for well-controlled organogenesis, and disruption of this process results in
sustained cell proliferation, which is a hallmark of solid
tumors. The Hippo pathway is a highly conserved cascade from
yeast to man, and many studies have linked the regulation of
organ size, cell contact inhibition, and stem cell function to the
Hippo pathway (1–4). Indeed, defects in the Hippo pathway,
such as double knockout of mammalian Ste20-like serine/

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human HCC cancer cell lines (HepG2, HLE, HLF, Huh1, Huh7,
PLC/PRF/5, and SK-Hep1), colon cancer cell lines (HCT116,
HT29, and SW620), gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, Kato III, and
NUGC4), and esophageal cancer cell lines (TE-1 and TE-11) were
used. A normal ﬁbroblast cell line (Hs68) was also used. The cells
were routinely maintained in medium supplemented with 10%
FBS (HyClone Laboratories, Inc.). All cell lines were maintained at
37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 and passaged for less
than 3 months after receptor resuscitation. The cell lines were
tested and authenticated by means of GenePrint 10 System
(Promega) in June 2015.
RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative reverse
transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) were carried out as previously
described (18–20). Further details and the primers used in this
study were summarized in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Protein sample preparation and Western blot analysis
Protein extraction from cultivated cells or human liver tissue
and subsequent Western blot analyses were carried out as previously described (18–20). Further details were summarized in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Extraction of cytoplasmic and nuclear protein proteins
The cells were washed by PBS and lysed by hypotonic buffer on
ice for 10 minutes. The lysate were centrifuged at 1,500  g for 5
minutes at 4 C, and the supernatants were collected and used as
the cytoplasmic fraction. The cytoplasmic protein was extracted by
hypotonic buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mmol/L KCl, 1
mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol]. The pellets
were washed twice in hypotonic buffer, centrifuged at 5,000  g
for 5 minutes at 4 C, and lysed by RIPA buffer on ice for 15
minutes. The lysate were centrifuged at 21,000  g for 10 minutes
at 4 C, and the supernatant were collected and used as the nuclear
fraction. All buffers contained protease phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Immunohistochemistry and immunocytoﬂuorescence
Sample processing and immunohistochemical procedures
were carried out as described previously (18–21). Further details
were summarized in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Antibodies and reagents
The primary antibodies used in this study were summarized in
Supplementary Materials and Methods. Fluorouracil (5-FU) was
purchased from Kyowa Hakko. Hydrogen peroxidase (H2O2) at
30% strength was purchased from Wako.
TAZ and YAP suppression with siRNA duplex oligonucleotides
Silencing of TAZ and YAP suppression was carried out using
siRNA and Stealth RNAi siRNA duplex oligonucleotides (Invitrogen). Cells were plated in a 6-well culture plate. Duplex siRNA was
transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Whole cell lysates
were made 24 or 48 hours after transfection. Three different
siRNAs were designed and purchased for each target gene (Stealth

4986 Cancer Res; 75(22) November 15, 2015

RNAi siRNA; Invitrogen), and the most effective siRNA was used
in subsequent experiments (Supplementary Fig. S1). The most
effective sequences were: siTAZ (WWTR1), 50 -CCCAGACAUGAGAUCCAUCACUAAU-30 , YAP: 50 -GGAAGGAGAUGGAAUGAACAUAGAA-30 , and the complementary sequences of each oligo.
The negative control siRNA was Stealth RNAi Negative Control
Duplexes (Medium GC Duplex; Invitrogen).
TAZ and YAP overexpression using plasmid vector
The cDNA corresponding to human TAZ or YAP1 was introduced into the pIRESpuro3 Vector (631619; TaKaRa). TAZ or YAP
was transiently overexpressed by transfection with the resulting
plasmid vectors into PLC/PRF/5 or HuH1 cells, which exhibit low
TAZ/YAP expressions, using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen).
Cells subjected to mock transfection were used as a control.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
To elucidate whether the correlations between TAZ and YAP are
direct or indirect using SimpleChIP Plus Enzymatic Chromatin
IP Kit (Magnetic Beads; #9005; Cell Signaling Technology) and
TAZ antibody (V386; #4883; Cell Signaling Technology) for
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay according to the
manufacturer's instructions, SK-Hep1 cells were subjected to
immunoprecipitation assay with anti-Histone 3 antibody (positive control), rabbit anti-TAZ antibody, or normal rabbit IgG
(negative control), and thereafter the immunoprecipitated chromatins were decross-linked. According to the manufacturer's
instructions, recruited DNA was subjected to real-time PCR reaction using ChIP primer sets, which were designed to include the
ortholog, promotor, exon1, or intron1 for YAP1. Human RPL30
primer was used for positive control in real-time PCR reaction.
Normoxia and hypoxia in monocultures
SK-Hep1 and HLF cells were cultured in 6-well plates under
normoxic conditions for 24 hours to allow attachment to the
dishes and then switched to hypoxic conditions (1% O2, 5% CO2)
for 48 hours. Total RNA or whole cell lysate from cell lines
cultured under normoxia or hypoxia were extracted for semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. Cobalt chloride
(CoCl2), a chemical hypoxia-inducing agent purchased from
Sigma, was also used to induce hypoxia in SK-Hep1 cells. SKHep1 cells were cultured in 6-well plates in a normoxic environment for 24 hours to allow attachment to the dish and were then
treated with CoCl2 (50–200 mmol/L) for 48 hours before collection and preparation of cell lysates.
Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation assays were carried out in 96-well plates, and
living cells were counted at each time point using WST-8 assays
with a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Laboratories) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance was measured at 450
nm. HepG2, HLF, SK-Hep1, and SW620 cells were transfected
using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). TAZ and/or YAP
expression were transiently downregulated using a predesigned
siRNA duplex directed against TAZ/YAP. A nontargeting siRNA
was used as a negative control. Various doses of 5-FU (KYOWA)
and curcumin (cat. no. 038-04921; Wako) were added to the cells
48 hours after seeding. The medium was changed daily. The ﬁnal
concentration of DMSO did not exceed 0.1% (v/v) in each
experiment.

Different Functional Roles of TAZ/YAP in HCC

Animal studies
All animal studies were conducted according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kumamoto
University (approval number D26-087). Six-week-old male
nude mice (BALB/cSlc-nu/nu; n ¼ 6 for each group) were
subcutaneously inoculated in the right and left ﬂanks with 1 
101 to 1  104 SK-Hep1 cells 48 hours after transfection with
siControl, siTAZ, siYAP, or siTAZ/YAP in 50 mL medium containing 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Tumor formation was
evaluated 8 weeks after inoculation. For in vivo analysis of the
shift from TAZ expression to YAP expression, 6-week-old male
nude mice (BALB/cSlc-nu/nu) were subcutaneously inoculated
in the ﬂanks with 2  106 SK-Hep1 cells in 50 mL medium. Mice
were then treated with 5-FU (35 mg/kg/d) or control (saline)
intraperitoneally for 7 days.
Patients and tissue samples
Parafﬁn-embedded sections and frozen tissues were obtained
from patients with HCC who underwent hepatic resection at the
Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Kumamoto University Hospital from January 2004 to December 2008. The study was
approved by the medical ethics committee of Kumamoto University (Project No. 770), and written informed consent was
obtained from the human subjects.
Curcumin
To investigate whether curcumin affected TAZ/YAP expression
and cell proliferation, HepG2, SK-Hep1, and SW620 cells were
plated in 96-well plates at 5,000 to 10,000 cells per well and
allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then treated with curcumin at concentrations ranging from 20 to 40 mmol/L under
standard culture conditions.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean  SD. Data analysis was performed
with SPSS 12.0.1 for Windows (SPSS Inc.). Statistical analyses
were performed using the c2 test or Student t tests. Overall survival
was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared
using the log-rank test. Differences with P values of 0.05 or less
were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Expression proﬁles of TAZ and YAP in gastrointestinal cancers
and predominant expression of TAZ as a prognostic factor in
HCC
In HCC tissues, overexpressed TAZ/YAP proteins was detectable in 54% of 100 samples, with 9% exhibiting strong positive
expression as measured by immunohistochemical staining
(Fig. 1A). Positive expression of TAZ/YAP was signiﬁcantly
associated with high proliferative activity, as assessed by Ki67 staining (P < 0.01; Fig. 1B). Interestingly, gastrointestinal
cancer cell lines exhibited different TAZ and YAP expression
proﬁles (TAZ > YAP, TAZ ¼ YAP, or TAZ < YAP; Fig. 1C). These
ﬁndings suggested that certain characteristics of gastrointestinal
cancer cells were dependent on the balance between TAZ and
YAP expression. Furthermore, these data implied that TAZ and
YAP may have different roles in cancer progression. In contrast
to other gastrointestinal cancer cells, TAZ was expressed at
higher levels than YAP in all seven HCC cell lines and human
HCC samples (Fig. 1D), indicating that TAZ was a predominant

www.aacrjournals.org

proﬁle while YAP was a minor protein in these cells under
normal culture conditions.
To assess the clinical relevance of TAZ expression in HCC, we
examined the expression levels of TAZ mRNA in HCC specimens
by real-time PCR (characteristics of patients from which the
samples were collected are shown in Supplementary Table S1).
These analyses showed that high TAZ mRNA expression was
signiﬁcantly associated with large tumor size and shorter overall
survival (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Table S2). These ﬁndings
indicated the applicability of TAZ mRNA level as a prognostic
factor in HCC and suggested that TAZ played a crucial role as a
pro-growth factor in HCC progression. Interestingly, although
YAP was expressed at low levels under normal conditions, high
YAP mRNA expression was also signiﬁcantly associated with
shorter overall survival (Fig. 1E). However, YAP expression was
not signiﬁcantly associated with clinical factors such as tumor size,
multiple tumor, and tumor marker expression (Supplementary
Table S2).
TAZ knockdown attenuated cancer cell growth by inactivating
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
We further assessed the biologic signiﬁcance of TAZ expression
in HCC cell lines by silencing of TAZ expression. In HepG2 cells,
which exhibit high endogenous TAZ expression, TAZ knockdown
using siRNA depleted TAZ protein expression, but not YAP protein
expression, at 24 hours after transfection (Fig. 2A). To validate
TAZ knockdown, we conﬁrmed the decreased expression levels of
cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) and connective
tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA, which are both well-known
downstream targets of TAZ/YAP (Fig. 2A). In HCC cell lines (HLF
and HepG2, which exhibit high endogenous TAZ expression),
TAZ knockdown decreased cell growth (Fig. 2B), which was
further conﬁrmed by decreased c-myc and cyclin D1 mRNA expressions (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S2). In contrast, TAZ
knockdown in HCC cell lines with low endogenous TAZ expression (HuH1 and HuH7) did not show such inhibitory effects on
cell growth and cyclin D1 mRNA expression (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2).
We next attempted to identify the intracellular signaling pathways regulated by TAZ. TAZ knockdown attenuated the phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6 but not that of Erk1/2 in HCC cells
(Fig. 2D). Conversely, TAZ overexpression upregulated the phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6 in PLC/PRF/5 cell (Fig. 2E). These
ﬁndings showed that TAZ promoted cancer cell growth by activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, and suggested that TAZ may
be a useful therapeutic target in HCC cells exhibiting with high
TAZ expression.
Functional roles of TAZ and YAP in chemoresistance
While several previous studies have reported that YAP plays an
important role in cancer chemoresistance (22, 23), the role of TAZ
in chemoresistance remains unclear. In addition, the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway has been reported to play a crucial role in
chemoresistance (24). 5-FU is a key drug used in chemotherapy
in various cancers including HCC. Treatment with 5-FU reduced
TAZ protein and phosphorylated p70S6 expressions in a concentration-dependent manner at 48 hours in SK-Hep1 cells (Fig. 3A).
Next, we examined whether TAZ played a role in chemoresistance
during HCC progression and whether 5-FU treatment plus TAZ
knockdown could accelerate the anticancer effects in HCC. Unexpectedly, TAZ knockdown plus 5-FU treatment (500 mmol/L)

blot analysis was performed. Intriguingly, while TAZ protein
expression was completely diminished by 5-FU plus TAZ knockdown at 48 hours, a shift to YAP expression was observed, which
resulted in increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Fig. 3C). Moreover, double knockdown of TAZ and YAP blocked the enhanced
chemoresistance induced by TAZ knockdown under 5-FU treatment in HLF and Sk-Hep1 cells (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, YAP
overexpression suppressed the expression of cleaved caspase-3
and cleaved PARP induced by treatment with 5-FU (500 mmol/L)
and resulted in enhanced chemoresistance in HuH1 cells (Fig.
3E). These ﬁndings suggested that HCC cells led to a shift to YAP
expression in response to downregulation of TAZ and promoted
chemoresistance to anticancer drugs. In HepG2 cells, treatment
with 5-FU reduced TAZ/YAP protein expressions in a concentration-dependent manner at 48 hours (Fig. 3F). However, the shift
to YAP expression was not observed in HepG2 cells in response to

www.aacrjournals.org

TAZ knockdown and 5-FU treatment (Fig. 3G). In HepG2 cells,
TAZ knockdown plus 5-FU treatment (500 mmol/L) successfully
enhanced the anticancer effects of 5-FU treatment alone (Fig. 3G).
These ﬁndings suggested that TAZ inhibition enhanced anticancer
effects under certain conditions, without stimulating a shift to
YAP expression in response to TAZ inhibition. However, in certain
HCC cell lines, TAZ and YAP could coordinately promote chemoresistance by switching an expression proﬁle dominated by
YAP expression. Under such conditions, a monotherapy targeting
TAZ during chemotherapy paradoxically caused chemoresistance
by compensatory YAP upregulation. Thus, this shift to YAP
expression played a major role in chemoresistance in HCC,
whereas TAZ played a role in chemoresistance under certain
conditions without a shift to YAP expression. Therefore, a multitarget strategy against TAZ and YAP is required for effective HCC
treatment during chemotherapy.

Different Functional Roles of TAZ/YAP in HCC

A shift to increased YAP expression in response to TAZ
downregulation could also be induced under normal culture
conditions
We further investigated whether this switching mechanism
between TAZ and YAP expressions occurs speciﬁcally under
chemotherapy treatment. Interestingly, under normal conditions in the absence of chemotherapy, TAZ knockdown also
led to compensatory YAP upregulation at a later phase (48
hours) in HLF and SK-Hep1 cells (Fig. 4A). Nuclear localization of YAP was increased by TAZ knockdown compared with
that in the control (Fig. 4A), and resulted in increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (Fig. 4B). YAP overexpression also
increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in HuH1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). Indeed, in HCC cell lines (SK-Hep1 and HLF)
exhibiting a shift to YAP expression in response to TAZ downregulation, the antiproliferative effects of TAZ knockdown was
modest (Fig. 4C). In contrast, YAP knockdown resulted in
dramatic anticancer effects equivalent to those of double
knockdown of TAZ/YAP, despite the low expression of YAP
compared with that of TAZ (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, the compensatory YAP upregulation in response to TAZ knockdown
also occurred in a normal ﬁbroblast cell line (Hs68) and
SW620 colon cancer cell line (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the
switching between TAZ and YAP may be an adaptive process in
normal cells and other types of cancer cells. In contrast to TAZ
knockdown, YAP knockdown did not induce compensatory
TAZ upregulation in HCC cell lines (HLF and SK-Hep1), and
additionally attenuated TAZ expression (Fig. 4E). In other
gastrointestinal cell lines (SW620 and TE-1 cells) exhibiting
high YAP expression, YAP knockdown did not induce compensatory TAZ upregulation, and attenuated the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 at 48 hours (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus,
YAP could rescue the antiproliferative effects induced by TAZ
downregulation, whereas TAZ could not compensate for the
loss of YAP expression. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggested
that YAP may be more critical and stand on upper level of
hierarchy than TAZ does in HCC progression, despite the lower
expression of YAP compared with that of TAZ under normal
conditions. On the other hand, such a shift into YAP expression in response to TAZ knockdown was undetectable in HuH7
and HepG2 cells, and the antiproliferative effects by TAZ
knockdown and YAP knockdown were additive, supporting
that a multi-target strategy against TAZ and YAP was required
for effective HCC treatment (Fig. 4F). To further analyze the
interaction between TAZ and YAP, ChIP assay was performed
(Fig. 4G). Then, the immunoprecipitated chromatin by anti-

body against TAZ revealed low YAP expression levels in similar
level to the negative control (Rabbit IgG), suggesting the
indirect interaction between TAZ and YAP.
A shift into YAP expression resulted in upregulation of cancer
stem cell markers and promotion of tumorigenicity
Chemoresistance is one of the cancer stem cell–like features.
In HCC cells with mesenchymal features (i.e., HLF and SKHep1 cells), in contrast to HCC cells with epithelial features (i.
e., HuH7 and HepG2 cells; refs. 20, 25), a shift into YAP
expression in response to TAZ inhibition resulted in upregulation of CD90, a HCC-speciﬁc cancer stem cell marker (26, 27),
at 48 hours (Fig. 5A). In SK-Hep1 cells, CD13mRNA expression
was also signiﬁcantly upregulated at 48 hours in response to
TAZ inhibition (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, in HuH7 and
HepG2 cells, which did not exhibit the ability to shift into YAP
expression in response to TAZ inhibition, CD13 and CD90
mRNA expression levels were not changed (Fig. 5A). Other
stem cell markers, such as EpCAM, CD133, and CD44, did not
show signiﬁcant changes in response to TAZ knockdown at 48
hours in HuH7, HepG2, HLF, and SK-Hep1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). High YAP mRNA expression in HCC tissue was
signiﬁcantly associated with high CD90 mRNA expression in
the clinical samples (Fig. 5B). In vivo, TAZ knockdown conferred increased capacity for tumor formation compared with
the control, whereas double knockdown of TAZ and YAP
reduced tumor formation capacity (Fig. 5C). Thus, the shift
from TAZ into YAP expression upregulated cancer stem cell
markers, such as CD90 and CD13, and conferred cancer stem
cell–like properties represented by tumorigenicity and chemoresistance in HCC.
Next, we investigated whether chemotherapy could induce a
shift into YAP expression in HCC cell, which was shown to play
an important role in chemoresistance. Continuous 5-FU treatment (500 mmol/L) for 96 hours decreased TAZ protein expression and induced a shift to YAP expression accompanied by
elevated CD90 mRNA expression (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, in
xenograft model, HCC cell–derived tumors in mice treated
daily with 5-FU displayed high YAP expression compared with
control mice treated with saline for 7 days (Fig. 5E). These
ﬁndings provided evidence that cancer cells exhibited a shift
from TAZ into YAP expression to escape and survive from
cellular stress, such as chemotherapy.
The tumor microenvironment is also a crucial factor responsible for maintain or obtaining cancer stem cell–like properties,
and hypoxic conditions have been reported to induce cancer

Different Functional Roles of TAZ/YAP in HCC

stemness (28). Thus, we examined whether hypoxic conditions
could induce a shift into YAP expression and CD90 mRNA
upregulation. Interestingly, when cultured under hypoxic conditions or following treatment with a chemical hypoxia inducer
(CoCl2), cells exhibited YAP upregulation and enhanced nuclear localization, although TAZ expression was also upregulated
(Fig. 5F). While CD90 mRNA level was increased in response to
TAZ knockdown under normoxic or hypoxic culture conditions, CD90 expression was not affected by hypoxic conditions
in both HLF and SK-Hep1 cells (Fig. 5G). CD13 mRNA level
was also not affected by hypoxic conditions in SK-Hep1 cells
(Fig. 5G). These ﬁndings suggested that a shift from TAZ into
YAP expression, rather than TAZ/YAP coexpression, played a
crucial role in the upregulation of cancer stem cell markers,
such as CD90 and CD13, in HCC. In addition, hypoxic conditions alone were not sufﬁcient to induce such a shift.
Curcumin suppressed TAZ/YAP expression and exerted
anticancer effects
As shown above, TAZ and YAP coordinately promotes cell
growth, chemoresistance, and tumorigenicity during cancer progression by switching the predominant coactivator (TAZ or YAP).
These ﬁndings indicated that TAZ/YAP coinhibition may be a
promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC. We then
found that curcumin, a major component of turmeric, suppressed
TAZ and YAP expressions and exerted anticancer effects in HCC
cell lines (HepG2 and HLF, which exhibited high TAZ expression)
and colon cancer cell line (SW620, which exhibited high YAP
expression; Fig. 6A and B). Interestingly, 20 mmol/L curcumin
suppressed YAP expression and induced compensatory upregulation of TAZ in SW620 colon cancer cell lines, but not in HCC cells,
although cell growth was markedly suppressed in SW620 cells
(Fig. 6A and B). This ﬁnding suggested that TAZ could be upregulated in response to YAP downregulation under selective conditions in SW620 cells, which exhibited high YAP expression, but
the rescue effect on cell survival was less than that of YAP.
Treatment with a high concentration of curcumin (40 mmol/L)
abolished abolished TAZ/YAP expressions and blocked cell
growth (Fig. 6A and B). Curcumin also could induce a shift into
YAP expression in HLF cells, which was suppressed by treatment
with a high concentration of curcumin (40 mmol/L). Furthermore,
curcumin treatment could attenuate the shift into YAP expression
in response to TAZ knockdown in HCC cells (Fig. 6C). Thus,

curcumin may exert powerful anticancer effects through suppression of TAZ/YAP expressions in HCC.

Discussion
Although TAZ and YAP have often been described to equivalent
factors downstream of the Hippo pathway, TAZ initially exhibited
higher expression than YAP in HCC, and TAZ overexpression at
the mRNA level was a prognostic factor predicting poor outcomes
in the current study. The inhibition of TAZ could reduce cell
growth by deactivating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
and could enhance anticancer effects induced by chemotherapy in
select HCC cells. Thus, although TAZ appeared to be a therapeutic
target in HCC, YAP could compensate for loss of TAZ expression
and confer cancer stem–like properties (such as chemoresistance
and tumorigenicity) with elevated expression of cancer stem cell
markers, such as CD90 and CD13, in certain HCC cells. Thus, a
shift from TAZ into YAP expression may play a crucial role in the
acquisition of cancer stem–like properties to escape from cell
death during cancer progression. Indeed, in microarray analyses
using embryonic, neural, and hematopoietic stem cells, YAP has
been reported to be enriched in all three stem cells (29). In the
current study, continuous treatment with 5-FU induced a shift
into YAP expression with elevated CD90 expression in HCC cells.
Hashimoto and colleagues reported that cancer stem–like sphere
cells displayed chemoresistance to 5-FU in HCC cell lines (i.e., SKHep1 and HLF cells; ref. 30). In terms of cancer stem cell markers
in HCC, Yamashita and colleagues (25) reported that EpCAMpositive cells (i.e., HuH1 and HuH7 cells), which exhibit epithelial features, and CD90-positive cells (i.e., HLF and SK-Hep1
cells), which exhibit mesenchymal features, were independently
and distinctively expressed in different cellular lineages. In addition, the existence of CD90-positive cells in HCC tissues has been
shown to be associated with a high incidence of distant organ
metastasis within 2 years after surgery. CD13 has also been
reported to be a marker of tumor-initiating and potentially
dormant cancer stem cells in HCC cell lines (26). In the current
study, a shift into YAP expression upregulated CD90 expression in
HCC cells with mesenchymal features (i.e., HLF and SK-Hep1
cells). In SK-Hep1 cell, CD13 was also induced in response to TAZ
inhibition. In contrast to HCC cells with mesenchymal features
(i.e., HLF and SK-Hep1 cells), the shift into YAP expression in
response to TAZ inhibition was not detectable in HCC cells with

epithelial features (i.e., HuH7 and HepG2 cells). Furthermore, in
HCC cells with epithelial features, cancer stem cell markers, such
as EpCAM, CD13, CD44, CD90, and CD133, did not show any
changes. Collectively, our data supported that the shift into YAP
expression was a key step conferring cancer stem–like properties,
including chemoresistance and tumorigenicity, in certain HCC
cells with mesenchymal features. The current study provides
important insights into the complementary molecular dynamics

between TAZ and YAP in cancer progression and into when and
how cancer cells acquire cancer stem–like properties to escape cell
death.
Intriguingly, YAP could be induced to compensate for
decreased TAZ expression, whereas TAZ did not display such
compensatory expression following silencing of YAP in HCC
cells. Such a shift into YAP expression was thought to be the
cause of the modest antiproliferative effects achieved by targeting

TAZ alone because double knockdown of YAP and TAZ enhanced
the anticancer effects of single knockdown in the current study. In
HCC cells with the ability to shift into YAP expression in response
to TAZ inhibition, YAP knockdown dramatically exerted anticancer effects equivalently to those in double knockdown of TAZ/
YAP, despite the low expression of YAP relative to that of TAZ.
These ﬁndings suggested that YAP was more critical and stood on
upper level of hierarchy than TAZ in HCC cancer progression.
Indeed, in Tet-On inducible YAP transgenic mice under control of
the apolipoprotein E promoter, YAP overexpression in hepatocytes drives cell proliferation and confers potent resistance to
apoptosis, resulting in widespread development of HCC throughout the liver, even at only 3 months (8). Hence, both TAZ and YAP
are key therapeutic targets, despite the differences in their expression levels in HCC.
In the current study, we found that continuous 5-FU treatment
could induce a shift into YAP expression with upregulated CD90
expression in HCC. However, one limitation of our current study
was that it was unclear whether the tumor microenvironment
(niche) induced such a shift into YAP-dominant expression under
conditions without chemotherapy. As a clue, although hypoxic
conditions could increase YAP and TAZ expressions, such conditions failed to induce CD90 upregulation. Thus, hypoxic conditions alone may be insufﬁcient to induce a shift into YAP expression in HCC. Future studies are required to characterize the
complicated tumor microenvironment that induces a shift into
YAP-dominant proﬁle in HCC.
In the current study, curcumin, a major component of turmeric
and an old Indian spice, successfully suppressed TAZ/YAP expressions and exerted anticancer effects in HCC cell lines. Curcumin
and its analogs have been previously shown to exhibit anticancer
effects in HCC via a variety of biologic mechanisms in vitro and in
vivo (31, 32). The inhibition of TAZ and YAP may be one of the
biologic anticancer mechanisms of curcumin in HCC. Indeed, in
an epidemiological survey, the mortality rates in patients with
HCC in India are very low (4%) and less than those in the United
States or Europe (33), despite the relatively high carrier rate (3%)
of hepatitis B virus in India, accounting for nearly 10% of hepatitis
B virus carriers worldwide (34). Further studies (i.e., epidemio-

logical surveys or randomized control trials) are needed to elucidate the biological and clinical roles of curcumin in HCC.
Collectively, TAZ and YAP coordinately participate in cancer
progression, affecting tumor growth and cancer stem–like properties (chemoresistance and tumorigenicity). HCC exhibited a
TAZ-dominant expression proﬁle rather than a YAP-dominant
expression proﬁle under normal conditions, and a switch into
YAP-dominant expression may be a key step to behave a cancer
stem–like property in HCC. Therefore, a multitarget strategy
against TAZ and YAP is required for effective HCC treatment.
Curcumin may be an effective anticancer agent, as it can suppress
TAZ/YAP expressions and a shift into YAP expression in HCC.
