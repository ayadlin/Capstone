ABSTRACT
CML is effectively treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the
efficacy of these drugs is confined to the chronic phase of the disease and development
of resistance to TKIs remains a pressing issue. The anti-inflammatory COX2 inhibitor
celecoxib has been utilized as anti-tumour drug due to its anti-proliferative activity.
However, its effects in hematological malignancies, in particular CML, have not been
investigated yet. Thus, we tested biological effects and mechanisms of action of
celecoxib in Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) CML and ALL cells.
We show here that celecoxib suppresses the growth of Ph+ cell lines by increasing
G1-phase and apoptotic cells and reducing S- and G2-phase cells. These effects were
independent of COX2 inhibition but required the rapid activation of AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) and the consequent inhibition mTORC1 and 2. Treatment
with celecoxib also restored GSK3β function and led to down-regulation of β-catenin
activity through transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms, two effects likely
to contribute to Ph+ cell growth suppression by celecoxib.
Celecoxib inhibited colony formation of TKI-resistant Ph+ cell lines including
those with the T315I BCR-ABL mutation and acted synergistically with imatinib in
suppressing colony formation of TKI-sensitive Ph+ cell lines. Finally, it suppressed
colony formation of CD34+ cells from CML patients, while sparing most CD34+
progenitors from healthy donors, and induced apoptosis of primary Ph+ ALL cells.
Together, these findings indicate that celecoxib may serve as a COX2-independent
lead compound to simultaneously target the mTOR and β-catenin pathways, key
players in the resistance of CML stem cells to TKIs.

cancer [1-3] by inhibiting the COX2-dependent secretion of
prostaglandin E2 by adenomatous cells.
Nevertheless, several reports indicate that celecoxib
exerts cell-autonomous anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects also in cancer cell lines that do not
express COX2 [4,5]. In line with these findings, dimethylcelecoxib, a close structural analogue of celecoxib that
lacks anti-COX2 activity (“non-COXib”), mimics the antitumor effects of celecoxib [6-8].

INTRODUCTION
Celecoxib is a sulfonamide COX2 inhibitor (COXib)
used in the therapy of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
In addition to its anti-inflammatory activity, celecoxib exerts
anti-proliferative effects on transformed cells, as shown in
some solid tumors. In particular, it is the only COXib used
for the therapy of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)
patients with the goal to prevent its evolution toward colon

Alternative targets of celecoxib are at present
elusive although recent reports have focused on PDK1,
SERCA, carbonic anhydrase, NFκB, and survivin [9,10],
all of which are typically inhibited at concentrations higher
than those usually required for COX2 inhibition [8,11,12].
Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a
myeloproliferative disorder caused by the BCR-ABL1
oncoprotein, is an ideal model to dissect COX2-dependent
and COX2-independent mechanisms of celecoxib growth
inhibition because the role of many signal transduction
pathways in CML cell proliferation and survival is
well established, allowing the effects of celecoxib to be
linked to the modulation of specific BCR-ABL-regulated
pathways. Moreover, drugs not previously known to play
a role in CML, such as the anti-diabetic drug pioglitazone,
appear to have important and unexpected effects in CML
[13], raising the possibility that growth-inhibitory effects
of celecoxib in Ph+ cells may be therapeutically relevant.
In CML, the BCR-ABL chimeric oncoprotein
which functions as a constitutively active tyrosine kinase
is also necessary for disease maintenance; thus, CML
provides an ideal model for testing the effects of “targeted
therapies”. Indeed, treatment with imatinib or secondgeneration tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has markedly
improved the survival of CML patients; however,
individual intolerance to these inhibitors, the emergence
of clones with TKI-resistant BCR-ABL mutations,
and the observation that leukemia-initiating/stem cells
are intrinsically resistant to these drugs, in part due to
overacting PI3K/AKT/mTOR and β-catenin pathways,
support the ongoing search for new drugs targeting CML
stem cells [14,15].
We show here that celecoxib, at concentrations near
those required for its anti-inflammatory effects, suppresses
proliferation and colony formation of imatinib-sensitive
and resistant Ph+ cell lines and primary cells, including
CD34+ CML cells. Of greater importance, celecoxib had
only modest effects on colony formation of normal CD34+
progenitors. Mechanistically, the effects of celecoxib
appear to be COX2-independent through AMP-dependent
kinase regulation of mTOR and β-catenin, two important
mediators of TKI resistance in CML stem cells.

a decrease in EC50s (e.g. for 6 days 8.2 µM for LAMA-84
and 23.8 µM for JURL-MK1; Supplementary Figure S1).
Then, we assessed whether the anti-proliferative effect of
celecoxib was due to COX2 inhibition. Immunoblots of
cell lysates revealed that the three cell lines express very
low levels of COX1, which is not targeted by celecoxib,
whereas expression of COX2 was not detectable
(Figure 1B). We also assessed the anti-proliferative effects
of dimethyl-celecoxib, an analogue unable to inhibit
COX2 [11] and of rofecoxib, a structurally distinct COX2
inhibitor. Dimethyl-celecoxib exhibited an EC50 of 16.8
µM in LAMA-84 at 24 hours. By contrast, rofecoxib had
no effect, even at the highest concentration (25 µM) tested
for 72 hours (Figure 1C).
The therapeutic potential of putative anti-leukemia
drugs is best measured by evaluating how efficiently
they suppress colony formation in a semisolid medium.
When cells were grown in culture media containing
80% methylcellulose, celecoxib or dimethyl-celecoxib
suppressed colony formation in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 1D) and, as expected, their activity was
not due to inhibition of COX2 since rofecoxib had no
effect. Again, LAMA-84 cells were the most sensitive to
treatment with celecoxib or dimethyl-celecoxib; however,
the EC50 of celecoxib calculated on the basis of the
methylcellulose assay (0.5 µM; Figure 1D) was markedly
lower than that based on the MTT assays (8.2 µM, after 6
days; Supplementary Figure S1).
As shown in Figure 1A, celecoxib, at concentrations
lower than 25 µM, has a cytostatic rather than a cytotoxic
effect, as MTT absorbance at 24 hours is not inferior to
that at the zero time-point. This was confirmed when cell
counts were used as a direct measure (data not shown).
Single cell DNA content analysis of propidium
iodide-stained nuclei showed that celecoxib (25 µM)
caused a marked increase in the G1 fraction (78.5 %
vs. 51.2 % of controls) of LAMA-84 cells (Figure 2A)
paralleled by a marked decrease of S (15.4 % vs 26.0 %
of controls) and G2 phase cells (6.1 % vs 22.8 %). Yet,
trypan blue exclusion data (Figure 2B) and microscopic
counting of fragmented nuclei stained with Hoechst-33258
(Figure 2C) revealed that treatment with 25 µM celecoxib
caused also the death of about 15-20 % of the cells.

RESULTS

Celecoxib impairs the activity of the β-catenin/
Tcf/Lef axis

Celecoxib impairs proliferation and induces cell
death of CML cell lines in a COX2-independent
manner

A great deal of attention has recently been paid
to the role of signal transduction pathways involved in
maintaining the self-renewal of leukemic cells. CML
stem cells appear to rely, among others, on the β-catenin/
Tcf-Lef-dependent transcription program [16]. This
pathway is aberrantly activated in CML mononuclear
cells both in the chronic phase and the blast crisis stage
[17]. In particular, BCR-ABL can inhibit glycogen
synthase kinase 3-Beta (GSK3β) that regulates

The effect of celecoxib on CML viability was
assessed in three Ph+ CML-blast crisis cell lines (K562,
LAMA-84, JURL-MK1) treated for 24 hours (Figure 1A).
Inhibition of proliferation was especially evident in the
LAMA-84 cell line (EC50 of approximately 23.8 µM),
while the JURL-MK1 cell line was the least responsive
(EC50 of 75.2 µM). Longer exposures to celecoxib led to

ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation
of β-catenin; in addition, BCR-ABL may directly
activate the transcriptional function of β-catenin by
phosphorylating it on tyrosine residues [18,19]. Thus, we
tested the hypothesis that celecoxib may exert its effect

on CML cells through negative modulation of β-catenin.
Indeed, celecoxib (25 µM) caused a marked decrease
of β-catenin protein expression in LAMA-84 cells
treated for 2-24 hours. This effect was already visible
after 2 hours and peaked after a 16-hours treatment

(Figure 3A). We next assessed whether the effect was
due to transcriptional regulation of β-catenin expression.
Indeed, treatment with celecoxib for 2 hours led to a
marked decrease (almost by 75%) of β-catenin mRNA
levels as measured by RT-PCR, an effect that lasted for
24 hours after a single drug treatment (Figure 3B).

We also assessed whether inhibition of proteasome
activity by treatment with MG132 could restore the
effect of celecoxib on β-catenin expression. Cells were
exposed to celecoxib only for 2 hours in order to limit
its transcriptional effects, although still ensuring a 20%
reduction of β-catenin levels. As shown in Figure 3C,

MG132 treatment alone caused a seven-fold increase of
β-catenin protein levels in comparison to control treatment
(0.1% DMSO) but, more importantly, this effect was also
detected in cells treated with celecoxib.
A pre-condition for the proteasome-dependent
degradation of β-catenin is its N-terminal phosphorylation
by GSK3β. To monitor the activity of GSK3β in
celecoxib-treated cells, we measured the levels of ser-9

phosphorylation, which denotes the inactive form of the
kinase [20]. As shown in Figure 3D, celecoxib inhibited
the phosphorylation of this kinase, already after a 4-h
treatment. Further proof that GSK3β reactivation played
a role in the celecoxib-induced proteasomal degradation
of β-catenin was obtained upon treatment with the GSK3β
inhibitor BIO (10 µM); exposure to this inhibitor caused,
on its own, a fourteen-fold increase of β-catenin levels

as compared to mock treatment (0.1% DMSO), an effect
which was not blocked by simultaneous administration of
celecoxib (Figure 3E).
Previous studies have shown that cytosolic
stabilization of unphosphorylated β-catenin allows its
translocation to the nucleus [21,22]. Thus, immunoblotting
of lysates of LAMA-84 cells with an antibody recognizing
only the unphosphorylated form of β-catenin (actβcat), revealed that celecoxib reduced the levels of
this transcription-competent isoform in a time- and
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4A and 4B,
respectively).
The β-catenin/Tcf/Lef complex trans-activates
genes with growth-promoting or anti-apoptotic activity.
One of such target genes is the c-myc oncogene; thus,
quantitative RT-PCR analysis of c-myc mRNA levels in
LAMA-84 cells treated with 25 µM celecoxib (for 2, 8 or
24 hours) revealed a marked decrease (more evident after
8 hours) in the levels of c-myc transcripts (Figure 4C) and
protein levels (Supplementary Figure S2), consistent with
inhibition of active β-catenin.
Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin impairs the
transcription of the CDKN2A gene, which encodes the
p16INK4a tumour suppressor protein, with an inhibitory
effect on cell cycle progression [23,24]. RT-PCR of
p16INK4a mRNA levels assessed after treatment with
25 µM celecoxib revealed a significant increase of
these transcripts, although only after a 24-h treatment
(Figure 4C).
To establish a correlation between the effect
of celecoxib on β-catenin protein stability and on
proliferation/colony formation of Ph+ CML cells, we
generated a LAMA-84 parental cell line expressing a
constitutively active mutant form of β-catenin (β-catenin
S33Y) that cannot be targeted to the proteasome because
it is not phosphorylated by GSK3β [25,26]. As expected,
cells expressing the degradation-resistant form of
β-catenin were significantly more resistant than parental
cells to either acute (Figure 4D, upper panel) or chronic
(Figure 4D, lower panel) exposure to celecoxib.

In agreement with these findings, treatment with
celecoxib reduced the phosphorylation of S6 Kinase (p70S6K) and eIF4E binding protein (4E-BP1), the two most
important mTORC1 targets, as demonstrated by use of
phospho-specific antibodies directed against thr-389 of
p70S6K and the N-terminal domain of 4E-BP1 (Figure
5B). Similarly, celecoxib caused also a decrease in the
phosphorylation of ser-473 Akt, which is the immediate
target of mTORC2 (Figure 5B).
Since p70-S6K can negatively modulate GSK3β via
phosphorylation of ser-9, it is possible that celecoxib-induced
re-activation of GSK3β might be either the reason and/or
the consequence of an impairment of mTORC1 function.
Therefore, we used rapamycin (50 nM) to block mTORC1
activity and assessed whether this treatment recapitulates
the effects induced by celecoxib. Surprisingly, although
treatment with 50 nM rapamycin was as effective as 25 µM
celecoxib in causing a time-dependent reduction of GSK3β
phosphorylation on ser-9 (with a peak after 4 hours of
treatment), it did not modify the levels of β-catenin (Figure
5C). On the other hand, colony formation assays of LAMA84 cells treated with rapamycin (50 nM) and/or celecoxib (10
µM) yielded similar inhibition of GSK3β phosphorylation
while the combination was much more potent (86.04±3.45%
reduction vs control) than either drug used alone (celecoxib:
59.98±3.61%; rapamycin: 67.74±2.04%) (Figure 5D).

The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
contributes to the effects of celecoxib through a
Ca2+-dependent mechanism
The re-activation of GSK3β induced in CML cells
by both celecoxib and rapamycin suggested that it might
be the consequence of mTORC1 inhibition rather than its
cause. Moreover, the inability of rapamycin to entirely
recapitulate the effects of celecoxib suggested that the
molecular mechanisms linking treatment with celecoxib
to impaired mTORC1 activity remain unclear.
It is known that AMPK activity precedes that
of GSK3β in the inhibition of mTORC1 complex, thus
placing this complex under the control of both metabolic
stress and growth factors [30-32]. With this in mind, we
tested whether celecoxib inhibited mTORC1, primarily
through the activation of AMPK, an event that may be
reinforced by re-activation of GSK3β.
As shown in Figure 6A, celecoxib treatment
increased AMPKα thr-172 phosphorylation, the active
form of the catalytic subunit, in a concentrationdependent manner (upper panel) as early as 15 min after
treatment.
AMPK is switched-on not only in response to a
metabolic demand, represented by a relative increase of
AMP over ATP concentration, but also after an increase
of intracellular calcium, through the Ca2+/calmodulindependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) [29,32]. Thus, we
investigated which of the two pathways mediates the

Celecoxib inhibits the activity of mammalian
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and 2
(mTORC2)
Since GSK3β causes the disassembly of mTORC1
[27], we next investigated the effect of celecoxib on
mTOR and its downstream targets.
Figure 5A shows that celecoxib induced a timedependent decrease of ser-2448 phosphorylation, an
effect that was maximal within 4 hours of treatment.
Surprisingly, phosphorylation of mTOR on ser-2481 was
also diminished, although transiently, suggesting that, in
contrast to rapamycin and its congeners, celecoxib exerts
its inhibitory activity on both mTORC1 and mTORC2
complexes [28,29].

effect of celecoxib on AMPK using the HeLa human
cell line that lacks expression of LKB1, the kinase
responsible of AMP-dependent activation of AMPKα
[31]. As shown in Figure 6B, phosphorylation of AMPKα
on thr-172 was induced after treatment with celecoxib,
suggesting that LKB1 is dispensable for this effect of
the drug. Conversely, co-administration of the CaMKK
specific inhibitor, STO-609 (2.5 µg/mL), completely
abolished the phosphorylation of AMPKα (Figure 6B).
These effects were also observed in LAMA-84 cells
(Figure 6B).
The involvement of CAMKK-induced activation of
AMPK in mediating the effect of celecoxib was further
supported by MTT assays, where STO609, albeit having

some intrinsic activity, partially reversed the effect of
celecoxib (Figure 6C).
To provide conclusive proof for the role played
by AMPK in the anti-leukemic effect of celecoxib, we
reduced the expression of its α- catalytic subunit generating
LAMA-84 cells with low (highGFP; approximately 63%
reduction; Supplementary Figure S3) or normal (lowGFP)
levels of AMPKα using RNAi (see methods). Colony
assays showed that decreased expression of this kinase
was associated with decreased sensitivity to celecoxib
treatment (Figure 6D). Moreover, in highGFP cells
(with low levels of AMPKα), celecoxib failed to downregulate both GSK3β and β-catenin expression (Figure
6E), indicating that activation of AMPK is essential for

development for the treatment of lymphoma patients and
has been described as PDK1 inhibitor [33,34], reproduced
the effects of celecoxib (Supplementary Figure S4),

suggesting that activation of AMPK might be also relevant
for the effects of this compound.

pioglitazone [13] has demonstrated that such treatments
may be identified among those originally validated
for diverse applications. A drug that may have similar
behaviour is celecoxib since, in addition to its COX2dependent anti-inflammatory activity, it is the only COXib
that suppresses proliferation of cancer cells through
unclear mechanisms. Indeed, celecoxib induces similar
growth-inhibitory effects in COX2(+/+), COX2(+/-) and
COX2(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts, as well as in COX2negative hematopoietic cell lines, including the K562 line
[38-40], raising the question of which ones are the relevant
targets of celecoxib in cancer cells.
We show here that the growth suppression of
Ph+ CML and ALL cells by celecoxib treatment is due
primarily to a COX2-independent mechanism based on the
rapid activation (within minutes) of AMPK, most likely
through Ca2+-dependent induction of the upstream kinase,
CaMKK. The involvement of the latter kinase would be
in partial agreement with Pyrko and colleagues [10], who
demonstrated that celecoxib is able to induce Ca2+ release
from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. However, in
contrast to Pyrko and colleagues, we were unable to detect
activation of ER stress response following celecoxib
treatment in LAMA-84 cells (data not shown).
Activation of AMPK seems to precede mTORC1
and mTORC2 inhibition, restoration of GSK3β activity,
β-catenin down-regulation and the impairment of CML
cell proliferation. Accordingly, partial knock-down of
AMPKα expression is sufficient to restrain the molecular
events described above as well as the anti-leukemic effect
of celecoxib. In support of the central role of AMPK in the
molecular and biological events triggered by celecoxib,
other groups have demonstrated that activation of AMPK,
in presence of functional p53, may activate the G1/S
checkpoint, leading to replicative senescence of cancer
cells [41]. In line with this observation, we demonstrated
that celecoxib is able to increase the transcription of
p16INKa, a prototypical marker of senescence [42].
Activation of AMPK would also explain the
ability of celecoxib to impair at least mTORC1, since
AMPK restores the inhibitory action of Rheb onto this
protein complex. Moreover, inhibition of mTORC1,
on its own, is likely to cause GSK3β re-activation
due to the suppression of S6K kinase, which normally
phosphorylates GSK3β [25,43]. Thus, it was not
surprising that there was a similar decrease in colony
formation of CML cells after treatment with celecoxib or
the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin. However, co-treatment
experiments revealed more effective inhibition of CML
colony formation, suggesting non-redundant mechanisms
of action of these two drugs. Indeed, celecoxib, but not
rapamycin, impaired Akt phosphorylation, most likely
via inhibition of mTORC2. Moreover, only celecoxib
caused down-regulation of β-catenin, an event that is
highly relevant for its anti-leukemic activity. In this

Effects of celecoxib, alone or with imatinib, on
colony formation of Ph+ cell lines (TKI-sensitive
or resistant) and primary CD34+ CML and acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells
TKIs are the cornerstones of current CML therapy,
although resistance to these drugs is frequently observed.
Thus, we tested the effect of celecoxib in imatinib-resistant
CML-blast crisis cells. As shown in Figure 7A, 25 µM
celecoxib or dimethyl-celecoxib, but not indomethacin
(a COX1 and COX2 inhibitor), completely eradicated
colony formation of three Ph+ TKI-resistant cell lines
(BV173R, K562R, KCL22R; for details see the paragraph
dedicated to in vitro cell lines in “materials and methods”).
We also tested whether imatinib and celecoxib
have additive effects on the clonogenicity of TKIsensitive LAMA-84 CML-blast crisis cells. As shown
in Figure 7B, celecoxib, although used at a sub-optimal
concentration (10 µM), potentiated the inhibitory effect
of a therapeutic dose of imatinib (1 µM). Importantly,
the Combination Index (CI) of the celecoxib/imatinib cotreatment, calculated on the inhibition of colony formation
obtained by crossing four different concentrations of the
two drugs (corresponding, respectively, to their EC20, 40,
60, 80), was less than one, indicating that this drug-drug
interaction is synergistic according to Loewe’s rule [36].
To determine whether celecoxib affects also the
proliferation and survival of primary CML blasts, we
performed colony assays of CD34+ cells from four chronicphase CML patients. Strikingly, treatment with 25 µM
of either celecoxib or dimethyl-celecoxib suppressed
almost entirely CML cell colony formation (Figure 7C,
white columns). By contrast, these treatments spared a
sizable number of colonies derived from normal CD34+
progenitors (Figure 7C, black columns), demonstrating a
relative selectivity of celecoxib and dimethyl-celecoxib
toward BCR-ABL-expressing cells.
Finally, treatment with celecoxib or its dimethyl
derivative suppressed the proliferation of Ph+ blasts
isolated from ALL patients, including one resistant to
imatinib and ponatinib, as assessed by means of cell
counting (Supplementary Figure S6). Of note, this
effect was associated with a significant increase of
apoptosis, as indicated by detection of caspase 3 activity
(Supplementary Figure S6).

DISCUSSION
The evidence that TKI-based therapies are unable
to eradicate CML stem cells supports the ongoing search
for novel treatments that, by targeting these cells, may
prevent disease relapse or transition to blast crisis [37]. A

regard, several groups have demonstrated that activation
of the Wnt/β-catenin/Tcf-Lef pathway is essential for
maintaining the self-renewal of leukemic stem cell
(LSC) [22]. Moreover, it is becoming clear that aberrant
activation of the β-catenin/Tcf-Lef axis promotes the
transition of CML from chronic phase to blast crisis
[19,21,22]. Indeed, BCR-ABL enables β-catenindriven transcription independently of Wnt stimulation,
since: i) it inhibits the GSK3β-dependent degradation of
β-catenin; and ii) facilitates the interaction of β-catenin
with Tcf/Lef [44]. Based on these observations, Heidel
and colleagues [19] hypothesized that inhibition of
canonical Wnt signalling would hamper CML resistance
to imatinib, thereby maximizing the therapeutic benefit
of a co-treatment with TKIs. In agreement with this
concept, celecoxib reduced the clonogenic potential of
TKI-resistant CML cells (including cell lines carrying the
T315I BCR-ABL mutation) and synergized with imatinib
upon co-treatment of TKI-responsive cells. Intriguingly,
induction of β-catenin degradation by celecoxib has been
previously reported in human colon carcinoma [45].
In favour of a possible therapeutic use of celecoxib
in the management of CML patients, we found that, in
contrast to what described for TKIs [46,47], this drug
does not activate autophagy despite its ability to impair
mTORC1 (data not shown); although this may seem
contradictory, it is known that mTORC1 inhibition does
not invariably induce the autophagic response, as already
shown for rapamycin [48].
Even more translationally-relevant, celecoxib also
suppressed proliferation and colony formation and induced
apoptosis of CD34+ CML cells and primary Ph+ ALL cells,
respectively; this effect appears to be relatively selective
as it was significantly less pronounced in normal CD34+
progenitors from healthy donors.
The argument most commonly used against the
specificity of COX2-independent, anti-proliferative,
effects of celecoxib is that they were observed at drug
concentrations higher than 100 µM. In this regard, most
of our experiments were performed at a concentration
of 10-25 µM and the colony assays demonstrated that
celecoxib may be active even at lower concentrations,
with an EC50 of 0.5 µM in the LAMA-84 cell line. These
data are important since it was shown that, at least in
mice, plasmatic concentrations as high as 45 µM are well
tolerated in vivo [49]. Noteworthy, due to the lipophilic
nature of celecoxib, this drug is concentrated three to
four times more in the bone marrow than in plasma [49];
therefore, a concentration of 25 µM celecoxib in the
hematopoietic compartment can be achieved at a dose of
950 mg, not too far from the daily dose commonly used
in the treatment of FAP patients (800 mg, divided in two
administrations).
We have shown that celecoxib is able to inhibit CML
blast proliferation and survival, in vitro and in patientderived cells, at therapeutically-relevant concentrations,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

through AMPK-dependent impairment of mTOR and
β-catenin activity. This mechanism is COX2-independent
and is mimicked by dimethyl-celecoxib and OSU03012,
a drug currently being examined in clinical trials, but
not by rofecoxib and indomethacin, two COX2-specific
inhibitors. Given the good tolerability of celecoxib and
OSU-03012, these findings support further investigations
of these agents for the treatment of Ph+ hematological
malignancies.

(all obtained through the Open Biosystems library of the
University College of London Cancer Institute) were used
to knock-down expression of AMPKα in LAMA-84 cells.
Viruses were prepared as described in the supplementary

western blotting with anti-AMPKα rabbit polyclonal
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers,
MA, USA). Flow cytometry and cell sorting by means
of green-fluorescence intensity (the FL1-A parameter,
BioRad S3) were used to dissect high-expressing (top10%
of the FL1-A channel, indicated as highGFP) from low
expressing (bottom 10%, indicated as lowGFP) cells.
HighGFP cells, having the least AMPKα expression,
were routinely compared to lowGFP cells, which express
AMPKα at levels comparable to wild-type LAMA-84
cells.
