BACKGROUND: Predicting survival is uniquely difficult in patients with pancreatic cancer who receive chemotherapy. The authors
developed a systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) based on peripheral neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts and
evaluated the ability of the SIRI to predict the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer who received chemotherapy. METHODS:
The SIRI was developed in a training set of 177 patients who had advanced pancreatic cancer and received palliative chemotherapy.
The ability of the SIRI to predict a patient’s survival after chemotherapy was validated in 2 independent cohorts (n 5 397). RESULTS:
Compared with patients who had an SIRI <1.8, patients in the training cohort who had an SIRI 1.8 had a shorter time to progression
(TTP) (hazard ratio [HR], 2.348; 95% confidence interval, 1.559-3.535; P 5 .003) and shorter overall survival (OS) (HR, 2.789; 95% confidence interval, 1.897-4.121; P < .001). Comparable TTP and OS findings were observed in 2 independent validation cohorts. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the SIRI was an independent prognostic factor for both TTP and OS. In addition, compared with no
change, an increase in the SIRI at week 8 was associated with poor TTP and OS, whereas a decrease in the SIRI was associated with
improved outcomes. In addition, high SIRI scores were correlated with higher serum levels of interleukin 10, C-C motif chemokine
ligand 17 (CCL17), CCL18, and CCL22 and with a shortened TTP. CONCLUSIONS: The SIRI can be used to predict the survival of
patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas who receive chemotherapy, potentially allowing clinicians to improve treatment outcomes

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death and has an overall 5-year survival rate of <5%.1 Surgical resection is the only curative treatment option, but >80% of patients are diagnosed at late, inoperable stages.2
Gemcitabine-based or FOLFIRINOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy has prolonged
patient survival and is approved as a first-line of treatment for metastatic pancreatic cancer, among which, gemcitabinebased chemotherapy using gemcitabine monotherapy or couplets such as gemcitabine with albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel has been widely used both in China and abroad.3-5 However, most patients with pancreatic cancer do not respond to
treatment, and only a few achieve disease stabilization or a partial response to treatment.3-5 Therefore, it is important to
identify a prognostic tool that can predict patient survival and allow the tailoring of future therapies for those patients who
would have a worse outcome.
Cancer-related inflammation has been suggested as the seventh hallmark of cancer.6 Recent studies have identified
the roles of local immune response and systemic inflammation in cancer progression and patient survival.7 Systemic
inflammation involves immune cells, cytokines, and small inflammatory proteins that are present and detectable in the
systemic circulation.7 The routine indicators of the systemic inflammatory response are circulating white cells and acutephase proteins. It has been reported that white cell counts, which include neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts,
and levels of acute-phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein, have prognostic value in many types of cancer, including

pancreatic cancer, as do the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio
(NLR), the platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and the
Glasgow prognostic score.8-12 Several studies have indicated that an elevated NLR or C-reactive protein level is a
poor prognostic marker for patients who have operable or
metastatic pancreatic cancer.9,13,14
Systemic inflammation may also affect a patient’s
response to chemotherapeutic agents. A recent study of
pancreatic cancer in a mouse model revealed that systemic
inflammation diminished the beneficial effects of gemcitabine.15 Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which are
abundant in pancreatic cancer tissue, induce gemcitabine
resistance in pancreatic cancer cells.16 Therefore, systemic
inflammation may alter the response to chemotherapeutic
agents and affect patient survival. However, the correlation
between the systemic inflammatory response and survival
after chemotherapy has not been evaluated in patients with
pancreatic cancer. In addition, an integrated signature
based on clinically available peripheral neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts, which may better reflect
the local immune response and systemic inflammation, has
not yet been reported in patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer who receive gemcitabine.
Therefore, in this study, we developed a systemic
inflammation response index (SIRI) based on peripheral
neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts. We evaluated the ability of the SIRI to predict the survival of patients
with pancreatic cancer who were receiving gemcitabinebased chemotherapy in 3 independent cohorts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Clinical Specimens

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (Shanghai,
China), and written informed consent was obtained from
each participant in accordance with institutional guidelines.
We retrospectively recruited 574 patients who had
pathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic
pancreatic adenocarcinoma from the Fudan University
Shanghai Cancer Center. The criteria for locally advanced
disease included tumor invasion of the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, or both, corresponding to stage III
pancreatic cancer according to the International Union
Against Cancer TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors
(sixth edition). The standard radiologic studies performed
included contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or magnetic
resonance cholangiopancreatography. Clinical variables,
including demographic data, complete blood counts,

were collected. Patients who had acute infectious diseases,
including acute pancreatitis, cholangitis, or other active
concomitant infections, within the past month were
excluded from all of the analyses.
Our analyses involved 3 separate patient cohorts.
The training cohort consisted of 177 patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer who were recruited between
January 2009 and December 2010 and were reported in a
previous study17; validation cohort 1 consisted of 321
patients who were recruited between January 2011 and
August 2013; and validation cohort 2 consisted of 76
patients from prospective, randomized controlled trials of
palliative gemcitabine chemotherapy in patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer (National Clinical Trials identifier NCT00837239).18 Patients received gemcitabine
monotherapy (gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 weekly for 7
weeks and, after a 1-week rest, on days 1, 8, and 15 every
4 weeks), or gemcitabine-based combination chemotherapy, including GEMOX (gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on
day 1 plus oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 on day 2 every 14 days),
or GP (gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 25 mg/m2
on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks). The treatment details
are provided in Table 1. Treatment response was evaluated as previously reported.18 Briefly, tumor assessments
with a chest roentgenogram, computed tomography, or
magnetic resonance imaging study within the month
before the start of treatment were required. Response
assessment, including radiographic assessment, was performed approximately every 8 weeks. Follow-up was terminated on April 27, 2012, in the training cohort, on
May 16, 2014, in validation cohort 1, and on August 24,
2010, in validation cohort 2.
Blood samples (2 mL) were obtained for neutrophil,
monocyte, platelet, and lymphocyte counts, which were
measured in the laboratory 1 week before initiating chemotherapy. The NLR was calculated by dividing the absolute
neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count. An
NLR 5 was considered elevated, as previously described.9
The same calculation was used to derive the PLR, with a
PLR of 150 as the cutoff for positivity in accordance with
previously published literature.9 The primary endpoint of
the study was the time to progression (TTP). Because there
is no consensus regarding the optimal cutoff value for tumor progression after chemotherapy for the lymphocyte/
monocyte ratio (LMR), the optimal LMR cutoff value was
calculated by applying receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) analysis, which revealed an optimal LMR cutoff of
3 in the training cohort. Therefore, an LMR of 3 was chosen as the cutoff value for all subsequent analyses. Blood

samples used for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) analysis were collected at the same time. Each participant donated 5 mL of venous blood. The blood was collected in tubes with an ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid
anticoagulant and was separated into serum and cellular
fractions within 4 hours of sample collection. The serum
was then stored immediately at 2808C until analysis.

ELISA

Serum levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), C-C motif
chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17), CCL18, and CCL22
were measured using an ELISA. The blood samples were
stored at room temperature for 30 minutes, centrifuged
(312,000g) for 15 minutes, and then cryopreserved at
2808C. The cytokine concentrations were measured
using a sandwich ELISA kit (DuoSet; R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, Minn).

The SIRI

The SIRI was defined as follows: SIRI 5 N 3 M/L, where
N, M, and L are the pretreatment peripheral neutrophil,
monocyte, and lymphocyte counts, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study was the TTP. The optimal
SIRI cutoff values for tumor progression after chemotherapy in the training cohort were calculated with an ROC
analysis. The Youden index (sensitivity 1 specificity 2 1)
was used to select a threshold to estimate sensitivity and
specificity. The results of the ROC analysis revealed an
optimal SIRI cutoff point of 1.8 3 109 in the training
cohort (Supporting Fig. 1; see online supporting information). Consequently, SIRI scores were classified as <1.8
or 1.8 for all subsequent analyses.
Statistical Analyses

Our primary outcome of interest was TTP. The secondary
outcome was overall survival (OS). The TTP was defined

as the time from the start of chemotherapy to the first
report of progression. Progression was defined as an
increase 20% in the sum of the greatest dimensions of
target lesions or the appearance of any new lesion. Patients
who had not experienced progression at the time of death
or last follow-up were censored. The TTP was censored
on the date of death or last follow-up.18 OS was defined as
the interval between the initiation of chemotherapy and
death. For patients who had not died at the time of last
follow-up, OS was censored at the date of the last followup. Analyses of variance and Pearson chi-square tests were
used to assess any associations between variables. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the TTP and
OS in the different groups, and the log-rank test was used
to estimate the differences in survival. Multivariate Cox
regression analysis using a backward stepwise approach
was performed to determine whether the SIRI was an independent prognostic indicator of TTP and OS. All statistical calculations were performed using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows,
version 17 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). ROC curves were
used to compare the sensitivity and specificity of survival
prediction. Two-tailed P values < .05 were considered
significant.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Clinical Features

In total, 574 patients were enrolled in the study. Table 1
lists the clinical characteristics of patients in the training
and independent validation cohorts. All clinical variables
were measured at baseline, which was defined as 1 week
before the initiation of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.
In the training cohort, patients received a median of
Cancer

3 treatment cycles (range, 0-14 treatment cycles), and the
median TTP and OS were 123 days and 258 days, respectively. At the last follow-up, 101 patients (57.1%) in the
training cohort had confirmed disease progression after
chemotherapy, and 139 (78.5%) had died. In independent validation cohort 1, patients received a median of
2 treatment cycles (range, 0-12 treatment cycles), and
the median TTP and OS were 96 days and 232 days,
respectively. At the last follow-up, 256 patients (79.8%)
in independent validation cohort 1 had confirmed cancer
progression after chemotherapy, and 249 (77.6%) had
died. In independent validation cohort 2, patients
received a median of 2 treatment cycles (range, 0-10 treatment cycles), and the median TTP and OS were 106 days
and 160 days, respectively. At the last follow-up, 40
patients (52.6%) in independent validation cohort 2 had
confirmed cancer progression after chemotherapy, and
65 (85.5%) had died.
Correlations between the SIRI and clinical patient
variables are summarized in Supporting Table 1 (see online
supporting information). We observed that the clinical
patient characteristics were similar in the 3 cohorts.
TTP Analysis

In the training cohort, the median TTP for patients with
SIRI scores <1.8 was 158 days compared with 68 days for
those with SIRI scores 1.8 (log rank, 17.775; P < .001)
(Fig. 1A). The correlation between the SIRI and the TTP
was further confirmed in the 2 independent validation
cohorts. We observed that patients with SIRI scores <1.8
had a longer median TTP than those with SIRI scores
1.8 (validation cohort 1: log rank, 29.885; P < .001;
validation cohort 2: log rank, 19.282; P < .001) (Fig. 1B,C).

Univariate analysis of the training cohort indicated
that the SIRI score, the NLR, cancer stage, and CA 19-9
levels had a statistically significant association with TTP
and survival; whereas age, sex, tumor location, prior surgery, prior chemotherapy, the PLR, and the LMR had no
prognostic significance for TTP (Table 2). A low SIRI
score was associated with prolonged TTP (hazard ratio
[HR], 2.348; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.559-3.535;
P 5 .003). Univariate analyses of the validation cohorts
confirmed that the SIRI was associated with TTP (validation cohort 1, P < .001; validation cohort 2, P < .001)
(Table 2). We also noted that, although the NLR was correlated with TTP both in the training cohort and in validation cohort 1, its prognostic significance could not be
2162

verified in validation cohort 2. An additional multivariable analysis confirmed the SIRI as a significant independent factor for TTP (Table 3).
In the ROC analysis comparing the sensitivity and
specificity of predicting survival, the SIRI was a better predictor of survival and TTP than cancer stage or CA 19-9
in the training and validation cohorts (Fig. 3A and Supporting Fig. 2A,C; see online supporting information).

Prognostic Value of Changes in the SIRI

Patients who had baseline and week-8 SIRI measurements
were included in the analyses to assess the prognostic value of
changes in TTP and OS. Baseline and week-8 SIRI measurements were available for 64 patients from validation cohort 2
(from a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of gemcitabine palliative chemotherapy in patients with advanced
pancreatic cancer). A landmark analysis at week 8 was done
to assess the role of changes in the SIRI, calculated as the percentage change (calculation 5 [(SIRI week 8/SIRI baseline)
2 1] * 100) and subsequently grouped into 5 groups (>75%
decrease, 25%-75% decrease, no change [from <25%

observed that, compared with no change (from <25%
decrease to <25% increase [reference category]), increases
from 25% to 75% and >75% in the SIRI were associated
with poor TTP (HR, 1.47 [95% CI, 0.93-2.06] and HR,
1.96 [95% CI, 1.44-2.79], respectively) and poor OS (HR,
1.64 [95% CI, 1.18-2.87] and HR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.653.76], respectively) (Fig. 4A,B). By contrast, decreases from
25% to 75% and >75% in the SIRI were associated with
improved outcomes (TTP: HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.62-1.15]
and HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.54-0.85], respectively; OS: HR,

Correlation Between SIRI and Cancer-Related
Inflammatory Cytokines

We further evaluated the correlation between the SIRI
and the cancer-related inflammatory cytokines and chemokines IL-10, CCL17, CCL18, and CCL22. The distribution of serum inflammatory cytokine and chemokine
levels and SIRI scores in 200 patients derived randomly
from validation cohort 1 is illustrated in Figure 5. Patients
who had high SIRI scores tended to have higher serum
inflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels and a shortened
TTP compared with those who had low SIRI scores (data
not shown). We also observed that patients who had high
serum IL-10, CCL18, and CCL22 levels could have pro2164

longed TTP and OS, but we did not identify the effects of
serum CCL17 levels on TTP or OS in patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer (Supporting Fig. 3; see online
supporting information).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we developed an SIRI based on peripheral
neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts and confirmed that this SIRI can be used to predict the survival of
patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma after
gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. In addition, we confirmed that the SIRI was able to reflect the status of the
local immune response and systemic inflammation.
Systemic inflammation is the product of circulating
immune cells, cytokines, and inflammatory proteins.7
The tumor-derived secretome can condition the bone
marrow to increase myelopoiesis. In the context of inflammation, neutrophil precursors, such as myelocytes and
promyelocytes, might be released, thus leading to an
increase in circulating granulocytes.19 The prognostic and
predictive usefulness of circulating neutrophils is apparent
as an independent measure or as part of the NLR in many
types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. Studies have
consistently demonstrated decreased survival in patients
who present with a high peripheral absolute neutrophil
count or NLR.9,13 Likewise, high numbers of circulating
monocytes or platelets have been associated with increased
tumor progression and poorer survival in many types of

human cancers.11,20,21 In the current study, we have demonstrated that our novel SIRI is able to predict the survival
of patients with pancreatic cancer who received gemcitabine chemotherapy in 3 independent cohorts. The predictive ability of this tool was greater than that of the NLR,
the LMR, or other conventional predictors, such as tumor
stage and CA 19-9 levels. We also observed a correlation
between SIRI scores and cancer stage or CA 19-9 levels.
Because both cancer stage and CA 19-9 suggest tumor
burden (Supporting Table 1; see online supporting information), a late cancer stage and a high CA 19-9 level usually indicate a large tumor burden.22 Although the
inflammatory status of the patient may be a reflection of
overall disease burden, the SIRI reflected the status of systemic inflammation, and a change in the SIRI score was
correlated with clinical outcomes, suggesting that the
Cancer

SIRI could reflect tumor burden. Therefore, our results
may indicate that patients with SIRI scores 1.8 would
have a worse outcome after chemotherapy compared with
those with SIRI scores <1.8, a finding that allows clinicians to potentially improve treatment outcomes by identifying candidates for aggressive therapy.
The hallmarks of cancer-related inflammation
include the presence of inflammatory cells and inflammatory mediators (ie, chemokines, cytokines, etc) in tumor tissues.23 A leukocyte infiltrate is present in most tumors. The
components of such infiltrates include TAMs and related
cell types, mast cells, and T cells. Of these cell types, macrophages are essential components of the inflammatory
microenvironment of tumors.24-26 The TAMs located in
human tumors generally have an M2 phenotype, which is
oriented toward promoting tumor growth, remodeling tissues, promoting angiogenesis, and suppressing adaptive immunity; the presence of these cells also alters responses to
chemotherapeutic agents.27,28 More specifically, proinflammatory, tumor-derived soluble factors (eg, IL-1b,
IL-6) and cytokines released by activated T cells (eg, IL-4,
IL-10) initiate immunosuppressive pathways and promote
myeloid-derived suppressor cell differentiation into immunosuppressive macrophages.28-30 The chemokines derived
from various cell types in the tumor microenvironment
contribute to leukocyte recruitment, angiogenesis, and
tumor promotion.31 It has been demonstrated that TAMderived inflammatory chemokines, including CCL17,
2165

Original Article

CCL18, and CCL22, promote tumor progression by interacting with chemokine receptors that are up-regulated in
highly invasive tumor cells.31-33 In the current study, we
also evaluated the correlation between serum inflammatory
cytokine/chemokine levels and TTP and survival in
patients who received gemcitabine therapy. Patients with
high serum levels of IL-10, CCL18, and CCL22 had shortened TTP and OS. Most important, we identified a good
association between the SIRI and serum inflammatory
cytokine/chemokine levels: patients who had high SIRI
scores exhibited increased serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokine/chemokines and shortened TTP and survival, suggesting that SIRI was able to reflect the status of
the local immune response and systemic inflammation.
Therefore, SIRI may serve as an “immunologic signature”
in pancreatic cancer and potentially could be used to predict response to immunotherapy, which would allow clinicians to tailor future therapies for those patients who would
benefit most from immunotherapy.
The strength of this study lies in our validation of
the predictive value of the SIRI in 3 independent cohorts.
Most important, the SIRI exhibited better predictive ability for TTP and OS compared with conventional clinical
factors, such as cancer stage, CA 19-9 levels, or other
inflammatory markers (NLR or LMR). Another strength
is that the current study was focused on patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer. Most studies of pancreatic
cancer have focused on patients with resectable tumors
and on identifying molecular markers in tumor tissue;
however, resection is possible in only a minority of
patients, because patients usually have advanced-stage disease at the time of diagnosis.2 Safely obtaining sufficient
quantities of pancreatic tumor tissue for the identification
of prognostic markers is difficult in unresectable tumors.
In contrast, the SIRI is based on routine measurements of
total peripheral neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte
counts in the clinical setting, thus providing a noninvasive, easily accessible, reproducible, cost-effective and
(most important), feasible approach for predicting the
survival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer after
chemotherapy.
There are limitations to this study as well, mainly in
the design, which included retrospective data collection;
however, we have now validated the value of the SIRI in 1
prospective, randomized controlled trial of gemcitabine
palliative chemotherapy for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (validation cohort 2). Second, because of its
retrospective nature, the gemcitabine-based chemotherapy regimens in our study were not uniform. The treatment may have been gemcitabine monotherapy or
2166

couplets, such as gemcitabine with cisplatin/oxaliplatin. It
is difficult to determine whether the chemoresistance was
specific to gemcitabine alone or to the couplets. Finally,
there are new standard-of-care regimens in pancreatic cancer that were not included in this study. FOLFIRINOX
has been considered a standard treatment option for
patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.5 However,
patients who receive FOLFIRINOX may experience more
severe side effects than those who receive gemcitabine
alone, so this combination is usually given to patients who
are healthy enough to tolerate the potential side effects.
Therefore, FOLFIRINOX is not widely used for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer in China. This is also
the case at our institution, and very few patients in the 3
cohorts received FOLFIRINOX. Also, albumin-bound
paclitaxel (ABRAXANE) has been approved for use in
combination with gemcitabine as first-line treatment for
metastatic pancreatic cancer.4 Whether the SIRI could be
used for predicting survival in this situation remains
unclear because of limited clinical data. However, we
agree that this remains a valuable question to be addressed
in our future study.
In summary, despite the acknowledged limitations,
our data suggest that the SIRI qualifies as a noninvasive,
easily accessible, cost-effective, and universally available
method for predicting the survival of patients with
advanced pancreatic cancer after chemotherapy. Monitoring the SIRI can provide useful knowledge about the status of the local immune response and systemic
inflammation.
