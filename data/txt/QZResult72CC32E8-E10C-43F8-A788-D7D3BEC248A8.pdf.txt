portrayed as the ultimate effectors of a transcriptional program that commit cells to enter and
progress through S phase1, 2. Using a panel of tissue-specific cre-transgenic mice and conditional
E2f alleles we examine the effects of E2f1, E2f2 and E2f3 triple deficiency in murine ES cells,
embryos and small intestines. We show that in normal dividing progenitor cells E2F1-3 function
as transcriptional activators, but contrary to current dogma, are dispensable for cell division and
instead are necessary for cell survival. In differentiating cells they function in complex with Rb as
repressors to silence E2F targets and facilitate exit from the cell cycle. The inactivation of Rb in
differentiating cells resulted in a switch of E2F1-3 from repressors to activators, leading to the
superactivation of E2F responsive targets and ectopic cell divisions, and loss of E2f1-3 completely
suppressed these phenotypes. This work contextualizes the activator versus repressor functions of
E2F1-3 in vivo, revealing distinct roles in dividing versus differentiating cells and in normal
versus cancer-like cell cycles in vivo.

E2Fs function as transcription factors, with E2F1-3 as activators and E2F4-8 as repressors3–
8. Although it is a maxim of mammalian cell cycle regulation that the E2F1-3 activator
subclass is required for cell proliferation, the evidence for this is based almost exclusively
on in vitro studies using cells derived from murine and human tissues or on the in vivo
analysis of Rb mutant mice1, 2. Other experiments, however, suggest that these E2Fs can
also function as repressors in complex with Rb9–11, yet the relative contribution of
activation version repression and the physiological contexts in which these contrary E2F
functions are employed remain unclear.

To explore the functions of the E2F activator subclass, we derived
E2f1−/−;E2f2−/−;E2f3LoxP/− ES cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a, 1b) and compared the
consequences of inactivating the conditional E2f3LoxP allele in these cells versus in
E2f1−/−;E2f2−/−;E2f3LoxP/LoxP MEFs. The expression of E2f1, E2f2 and E2f3 in wild type
ES cells was generally higher than in MEFs and the loading of E2F3 protein on classic E2F
target promoters was comparable between the two proliferating cell types (Supplementary
Fig. 2a-c). Consistent with previous observations, the ablation of E2f1-3 in MEFs with
standard cre-expressing vectors led to the induction of p53 activity, the loading of E2F4p130 repressor complexes on E2F target promoters and a marked decrease in E2F target
expression (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 3a–c)5–7. Consequently, triply deficient MEFs
underwent a complete cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1b)5–7. In contrast,
E2f1−/−;E2f2−/−;E2f3Δ/−(TKO) ES cells failed to activate p53 or form E2F4/p130 repressive
complexes, and as a result, E2F target expression was unaffected and cells proliferated
equally well as E2f1−/−;E2f2−/−;E2f3LoxP/− (DKO) control cells (Supplementary Fig. 3a-c).
We then evaluated whether triply-deficient ES cells could proliferate in vivo. Subcutaneous
injection of TKO ES cells into athymic nude mice yielded efficient teratoma formation,
producing mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm at a rate similar to DKO ES lines (Fig. 1c,
Supplementary Fig. 4a, 4b). Moreover, from E2f1+/−;E2f2−/−;E2f3+/− intercrosses we

recovered the expected number of live TKO embryos as late as E9.5, but none were
recovered past E11.5 (Fig. 1d, and data not shown). The live E9.5 TKO embryos appeared
morphologically normal by gross and histological examination (Fig. 1e and data not shown).
While cell proliferation was normal in most tissues, there was evidence of decreased
proliferation and increased apoptosis in the myocardium and the first branchial arch of TKO
embryos (Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). These latter observations are consistent with heart
defects found in E2f3 singly-deleted adult mice12.

To explore whether E2F1-3 might have cell cycle-related functions in tissues that arise later
in embryonic and postnatal development, we exploited the highly organized cellular
architecture of the small intestine. Maintenance of structural and functional integrity of the
small intestine requires continuous epithelial regeneration13. Intestinal stem cells are housed
at the base of crypts of Lieberkühn and give rise to transit-amplifying cells. As these cells
migrate up from the base and into the finger-like extensions called villi, they exit the cell
cycle and differentiate13. Western blot assays showed that E2f1, E2f2 and both isoforms of
E2f3 (E2F3a and E2F3b) are expressed in the crypt and villus (Supplementary Fig. 6). We
used Ah-cre mice14 to ablate E2f1-3 in the small intestine in utero or in adult mice (Ahcre;E2f1−/−;E2f2−/−;E2f3LoxP/LoxP, TKO). Induction of Ah-cre expression by intraperitoneal
injection of β-napthoflavone (β-NF) led to the efficient deletion of E2f3LoxP in crypt stem
cells and transit-amplifying cells by one day post-injection, and in the entire intestinal
epithelium within 3–4 days (crypt and villus; Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Loss of E2f1-3 did
not result in a compensatory increase of other E2F family members, except for a modest
increase in E2f8 (Supplementary Fig. 7d). Whether E2f3LoxP was deleted in utero at E15.5
or in the adult at 2 months of age, the architecture of TKO small intestines remained
relatively intact and animals were asymptomatic for 90 days following β-NF administration
(Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 8a, 8b). Cell-type specific marker analysis demonstrated that
all differentiated epithelial cell-types were appropriately represented in TKO small intestines
(Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 9). Remarkably, cell proliferation was identical in TKO and
control intestines (Fig. 2c), however, we noted a marked increase in γ-H2AX and PATM1981 staining in TKO crypts and villi (Fig. 2d, 2e, Supplementary Fig. 10a). A parallel
analysis of retinal (Chen et al, accompanying manuscript) and lens (P.W. unpublished
observations) progenitors also revealed increased γ-H2AX staining in TKO samples
(Supplementary Fig. 10b, 10c). Together, these observations suggest that counter to current
dogma, E2F1-3 are dispensable for the proliferation of embryonic stem cells and their
mesodermal, endodermal, and ectodermal derivatives, and cells in at least some adult
tissues.

Close examination of H&E-stained slides revealed increased numbers of pyknotic nuclei in
TKO crypts (data not shown). TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 assays confirmed the presence
of apoptotic cells in crypts of TKO intestines (Fig. 2f). We also observed increased p53
immunoreactivity in TKO crypts (Supplementary Fig. 11a), which was reminiscent of
previous work showing exquisite sensitivity of this cellular compartment to oncogene- and
radiation-induced p53 responses15. While p53 was elevated in TKO crypts, we failed to
detect any significant increase in the expression of p53-responsive genes and moreover, the
conditional ablation of p53 (Ah-cre;E2f1−/−;E2f2−/−;E2f3LoxP/LoxP;p53LoxP/LoxP) did not

suppress the apoptosis caused by E2f1-3 deficiency (Supplementary Fig. 11b, 11c).
Together, these surprising observations suggest that E2F1-3 are dispensable for cell division
in the adult and that at least in the small intestine, they function in a p53-independent
manner to maintain DNA integrity and cell survival.

To understand the underlying mechanism for these unexpected results, we isolated crypt and
villus cell populations from control and E2f1-3-deficient (TKO) small intestines and
analyzed global gene expression profiles. Sample preparation and processing of the
Affymetrix oligo-arrays are described in the Methods section. We utilized an unbiased
method similar to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to identify genes that were differentially
expressed16. Two variables contributed to the observed gene expression changes, cell
compartment (crypt vs. villus) and genotype (TKO vs. control). The cell compartment
analysis compared gene expression in crypts and villi of the same genotype (Fig. 3a). For
control small intestines, this revealed that among the ~45K genes queried, 1207 genes were
upregulated and 2363 genes were downregulated as progenitor cells in the crypt migrated up
into the villus and exited the cell cycle (>1.5-fold, p<0.0001; Supplementary Fig. 12a,
Supplementary Table 1). As expected, the expression of most known E2F targets, as defined
by previous gene expression17, reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays18
(Supplementary Fig. 12b), was markedly higher in control crypts than in associated villi
(Fig. 3a, left panel), consistent with the proliferative status of crypts. For TKO small
intestines, the expression of E2F targets in crypts was only marginally higher than in their
associated villi (Fig. 3a, right panel), suggesting that expression of these genes were either
reduced in crypts, elevated in villi, or both.

The genotype analysis compared gene expression in TKO vs. control samples of the same
cell compartment. This comparison revealed a modest but significant downregulation of E2F
targets in progenitor cells of TKO crypts, which included many but not all known classic
targets such as Cdc6, Cyclin A2, Cyclin E2, Top2, and Hmgb2 (Fig. 3b–c, left panels,
Supplementary Fig. 13a). We suspect that continued proliferation of TKO progenitors in the
small intestine when E2F targets are limiting likely contributes to replicative stress, DNA
damage and the observed increase in γ-H2AX labeling in these cells. Whether these aberrant
processes are linked to the death of TKO progenitor cells remains to be rigorously evaluated.
The genotype comparison also revealed a remarkable upregulation of a large number of E2F
targets in differentiated cells of the TKO villus (Fig. 3b–c, right panels, Supplementary Fig.
13a). Western blot assays and IF staining showed that the accumulation of two of these E2F
target gene products, Mcm3 and Pcna, was widespread throughout the TKO villus (Fig. 3d,
Supplementary Fig. 13b). Similarly, there was increased expression of E2F targets in
differentiated TKO cells of the retina and lens (Supplementary Fig. 13c; PW unpublished
observations), suggesting a general role for E2F1-3 in transcriptional repression in postmitotic cells in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using villus-enriched
lysates derived from control and TKO small intestines showed that E2F3 occupies E2F
binding sites on classic E2F-target promoters (Fig. 3e). Importantly, coimmunoprecipitation
assays using intestinal epithelial cells derived from E2f3−/−, E2f3a−/− and E2f3b−/− villi
showed that both E2F3a/b isoforms19–21 participate in a complex with the Rb protein (Fig.
3f). Consistent with this, Rb was found to be hypophosphorylated in the villus

(Supplementary Fig. 14a). Together, these data suggest that E2F1-3 act as transcription
activators in dividing progenitors, and as repressors (in complex with Rb) in differentiating
cells of the small intestine.

On the surface, the observation that E2F1-3 repress E2F targets and are dispensable for cell
proliferation contradict previous findings from the analysis of Rb/E2f double knockout
animals1, 2, 8. Therefore, to thoroughly explore the mechanistic relationship between Rb
and E2F1-3, we used the small intestine as an in vivo system where results could be
uniformly compared across different genetic configurations. The Ah-cre mediated
inactivation of Rb in utero or in adult mice resulted in increased proliferation of cells in the
villus compartment but not in the crypt (Fig. 4a, 4b, Supplementary Fig. 14b–e), indicating
that Rb-deleted transit-amplifying cells failed to appropriately exit the cell cycle. There was,
however, no concomitant increase in apoptosis or defect in cell differentiation
(Supplementary Fig. 15a, 15b), and as a result, Rb-deficient villi appeared uniformly
hyperplastic. The combined ablation of the three E2fs completely suppressed the
unscheduled proliferation and hyperplasia caused by Rb deficiency (QKO; Fig. 4a, 4b,
Supplementary Fig. 16a). Importantly, the basal levels of proliferation in QKO crypts were
indistinguishable from control or TKO samples (Supplementary Fig. 16b), consistent with
the rather normal development of E2f1-3 deficient small intestines containing an intact Rb
gene.

The selective requirement for E2f1-3 in the proliferation of Rb-deficient cells provided an
opportunity to dissect possible cancer-specific mechanisms of E2F in cell cycle control. We
therefore compared global gene expression programs in control, RbKO, TKO and QKO
intestinal epithelia. Several important insights came from this analysis. First, there were
expansive gene expression differences between control and RbKO villi (1290 upregulated
and 487 downregulated genes; Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 2), but relatively minor
differences in their associated crypts (Supplementary Fig. 17a, 17b). Gene Ontology
algorithms22 identified a bias for differentially expressed genes involved in the regulation of
transcription, DNA metabolic processes and cell cycle (Supplementary Table 3). IF and
quantitative RT-PCR assays confirmed the dramatic accumulation of most E2F-target genes
in RbKO villi (Supplementary Fig. 17c–d). From these data we conclude that Rb is critical
for the repression of E2F targets at a time when progenitor cells commit to exit the cell cycle
and terminally differentiate. Second, hierarchical clustering of all data sets showed that TKO
and QKO tissues clustered together in a separate group from control and RbKO tissues
(Supplementary Fig. 18), suggesting that some functions coordinated by E2F1-3 may be Rbindependent. Finally and most importantly, the expression levels of E2F targets in TKO and
QKO villi were equivalent, and while higher than in control villi, they were substantially
lower than in RbKO villi (Fig. 4c). Quantitative RT PCR assays confirmed the relative
expression of E2F targets to be: control < TKO = QKO ≪ RbKO (Fig. 4d). From these data,
we conclude that the supra-elevated expression of E2F targets observed in RbKO villi is due
to both ‘derepression’ (lacking intact Rb/E2F1-3 repressor complexes) and E2F1-3 mediated
‘hyper-activation’. In the absence of E2F1-3 mediated hyper-activation, cells in QKO villi
fail to hyper-activate and thus do not accumulate sufficient levels of E2F targets to undergo

‘ectopic’ cell proliferation (this threshold level of expression is illustrated as a red dotted
line in Fig. 4d).
We provide overwhelming evidence showing that normal cell proliferation in mice can be
maintained in the absence of activator E2Fs. We conclude that E2F1-3, like G1 Cdk’s23–25,
are not as critical for normal cell proliferation in mammals as original studies implied3, 4,
26–29. However, not all is well in the absence of E2F1-3, since TKO dividing progenitors in
the small intestine undergo apoptosis. A prosurvival role for E2F1-3 was also evident in
retinal progenitor cells of the mouse (Chen et al., accompanying paper), however, in the
retina cell death was p53 dependent whereas in the small intestine it was p53 independent.
Thus, the sensitivity of cells to p53 activation varies considerably across tissue types.

The findings presented here also expose dual functions for E2F1-3 in transcription activation
and repression in vivo. In dividing progenitor cells, when Rb is inactive
(hyperphosphorylated), free E2F1-3 are employed to optimally activate the expression of
target genes. The inability to do so in E2f1-3 deficient tissues still permits cells to replicate
their DNA and divide, but at the cost of increased DNA damage and cell death. As cells
commit to a terminally differentiated fate, P-Rb is dephosphorylated and forms a physical
complex with E2F1-3 proteins. We propose that this is not to just sequester E2F activators
but rather, to form the first repressive complex that is necessary to downregulate E2F targets
and usher transit-amplifying cells out of the cell cycle. Once cells exit the cell cycle, other
professional repressor complexes accumulate, including p130/E2F4 and p107/E2F4, to more
permanently enforce the repression of E2F targets. Given that inactivation of Rb, but not
p107 or p13030, induces ectopic cell divisions in the small intestine, we suggest that Rb has
a unique role in transit-amplifying cells that is dependent on its ability to associate with
E2F1-3. Maintenance of quiescence in terminally differentiated cells of the villus, however,
is a function that is shared among all members of the Rb family30. In summary, this work
challenges the current paradigm of cell cycle control and provides, for the first time, a
unified molecular view of how the dual functions of E2F1-3 in transcriptional activation and
repression are employed in vivo to control normal versus Rb-mutant or cancer cell cycles.

METHODS SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Mice (E2f1−/−, E2f2−/−, E2f3f/f, Ah-cre and Rbf/f) used for the studies were in mixed
background (129SvEv, C57BL/6NTac and FVB/NTac). β-napthoflavone (sigma;
N3633-5G) was administered into 2 month old Ah-cre mice three times within 24 hours as
described previously14 and mice were harvested 7 or 90 days later. β-napthoflavone was
also injected into pregnant female mice at 15.5 days postcoitum for analysis of embryos at
E18.5. Villus and crypt fractions were isolated as previously described8. Three independent
samples from each genetic group were used for gene expression analysis by Affymetrix
microarray. Analysis of gene expression data were performed using BRB-array tools
developed by Dr. Richard Simon and Amy Peng Lam of the National Cancer Institute. Gene
Ontologies were predicted by DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery) Bioinformatics Resources at the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious diseases, NIH. X-gal staining, real-time RT-PCR, BrdU, ChIP and TUNEL assays
were performed as previously described8, 19. Primers for ChIP, real-time RT-PCR and

a Expression of E2F-regulated genes was measured by real-time RT-PCR in proliferating
ES and MEFs cells with the indicated genotypes (primer information is provided in
Supplementary Fig. 19). b. Growth curves of two sets of DKO and TKO ES cell clones (A
and B) and DKO and TKO MEFs. c. DKO and TKO ES cells were injected underneath the
skin of athymic nude mice and teratomas were harvested, sectioned and stained with H&E.
Representative tissues of DKO and TKO teratomas include muscle (mesoderm), respiratory
epithelium (endoderm), skin and neural cells (ectoderm). d. Embryos derived from
intercrosses between E2f1+/−;E2f2−/−;E2f3+/− mice were collected at various timepoints
during pregnancies. e. Representative E9.5 embryos were photographed immediately upon
collection; E2f2−/− (SKO), E2f2−/−;E2f3−/− (DKO), and E2f1−/−E2f2−/−E2f3−/− (TKO)
embryos.
