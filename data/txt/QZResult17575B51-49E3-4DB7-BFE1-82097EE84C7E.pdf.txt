BACKGROUND: Metastatic colorectal cancer is frequently treated with irinotecan, a topoisomerase-I inhibitor. The
UGT1A1 gene encodes for an enzyme that metabolizes irinotecan, and its genetic variants were shown to be associated with increased drug toxicity. We evaluated clinical outcomes associated with the UGT1A1*28 variant. METHODS:
The study included 329 colorectal cancer patients from the Israeli population-based Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study who were treated with a chemotherapy regimen that included irinotecan. Patients with metastases or disease recurrence were followed up for a median period of 2 years after occurrence of the event. Study end
points were appearance of grade 3-4 hematological and gastroenterological toxicity, hospitalization due to toxic
events (mostly neutropenia, fever, diarrhea, or vomiting), length of hospitalization, and overall survival. UGT1A1*28
was genotyped from peripheral blood DNA by fragment analysis and reported as number of TATA sequence repeats
in the promoter of the gene. RESULTS: The 7/7 variant of UGT1A1*28 was detected in 11.9% of the 329 participants.
Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity was significantly higher in 7/7 carriers compared with 6/7 and 6/6 carriers
(48.0%,10.2%, and 7.7% respectively; P < .001), as was the risk of toxicity-related hospitalization (45.8%, 25.3%, and
14.4% respectively; P ¼ .001). Both short-term death within 2 months of treatment start (12.8%, 5.2%, and 2.9%,
respectively) and median overall survival (1.6, 2.0, and 2.4 years, respectively; P ¼ .01) were significantly worse in the
7/7 carriers. The age/stage-adjusted hazard ratio for patients with the 7/7 genotype compared with 6/6 was 1.7 (95%
confidence interval, 1.1-2.3). CONCLUSIONS: The UGT1A1*28 7/7 genotype is strongly associated with severe hematological toxicity and higher hospitalization rate and predicts lower survival of colorectal cancer in users of irinotecan.

KEYWORDS: irinotecan, colorectal cancer, UGT1A1, toxicity, survival.

Metastatic colorectal cancer is frequently treated with irinotecan (CPT-11), a topoisomerase-I inhibitor.1 The gene
UGT1A1 encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the glucuronidation of the active irinotecan metabolite SN-38, which is eliminated in the liver by metabolic alteration to an inactive form SN-38G.2 Irinotecan toxicity is observed relatively commonly, and myelosuppression (neutropenia) and diarrhea are the most commonly reported dose-limiting toxicities.3,4
Homozygosity for the UGT1A1*28 allele (7/7) has been shown to be associated with irinotecan-related hematological5-13
or gastrointestinal11,14-16 toxicity. These findings led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005 to require that
gene-related information be added to the drug product label.17 It is as yet unclear if carriers of the different genetic variants
also have a different prognosis7,8,18,19 or differ in number or length of hospitalizations.11 We retrospectively evaluated the
association between UGT1A1 genetic variation, prevalence of severe toxicity, and survival of irinotecan-treated colorectal
cancer patients in a large cohort of consecutive patients.

newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients in Northern
Israel. A total of 2135 patients from phase 1 of the study,
which took place in 1998-2004, served as the source for
the patients participating in the current analysis. The
study was approved by the institutional review board
committees of Carmel Medical Center (Haifa, Israel) and
the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI).
The methods of the MECC study have been
described previously.20 In brief, patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer and their population-based,
randomly selected, age/sex/residence/ethnicity-matched
controls were identified. After signing a consent form, the
patients were interviewed using an extensive questionnaire
and gave a venous blood sample, which was further separated into DNA, serum, and lymphocytes.
Baseline clinical information included data extracted
from pathology reports of all patients (stage at diagnosis,
grade, tumor location in the colon, histological type).
Follow-Up
The medical records of 2135 patients with colorectal cancer recruited in phase 1 of the MECC study were sought.
Of these, 2039 (95.5%) were retrieved with either full
follow-up data (n ¼ 1762) or partial follow-up data
(n ¼ 277). Ninety-six records could not be found, either
because the patient was diagnosed at a very early stage and
did not undergo oncological surveillance or because the
patient died shortly after diagnosis. Medical records were
extracted to provide information about events of tumor
recurrence, appearance and location of metastases,
appearance of second primary tumors in or outside the
colon, as well as detailed treatment information. Date of
death and cause of death were available from the Israeli
population register.
Among the 2039 MECC patients, 387 patients were
identified as having been treated with irinotecan-based
chemotherapy and serve as the study group for this report.
Blood samples were available for genetic analysis for 329
(85.0%) patients. The time of first evidence of an event
(metastasis or local recurrence) was recorded or imputed
as the time of start of treatment if the time of the event
was missing in the record (in 23 [5.9%] patients). Records
of 214 (65.0%) patients with genetic analyses could be
retrieved and were studied for evaluation of events of
hematological or nonhematological toxicity.
Laboratory Assays
Genomic DNA extracted from blood was used for genotyping either via simple determination of the TATA box

sequence in patient DNA or via implementation of fragment analysis. Isolation of the UGT promoter region,
which carries the *28 mutation, was performed using the
following primers: 50 -TTC CAG CCA GTT CAA CTG
TTG-30 (forward), 50 -GCC TTT GCT CCT GCC AG30 (reverse). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products
underwent a sequencing PCR reaction using BigDye Terminator reagents (Applied Biosystems). Forward primer
was used for reaction initiation. Products were purified
using a BigDye XTerminator purification kit (Applied
Biosystems) and were sequenced with the 3130xl Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Fragment analysis was
performed by isolating the UGT promoter region via
PCR reaction with the following FAM labeled primers: 5FAM0 -AAA TTC CAG CCA GTT CAA CTG TTG TT30 (forward), 50 -GCC TTT GCT CCT GCC AG-30
(reverse). PCR products were diluted at 1:20, and 1 lL
was added to a reaction solution containing 8.5 lL formamide and 0.5 lL GeneScan-500 ROX Size Standard
(Applied Biosystems). Fragment analysis was performed
with the 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. The polymorphism
UGT1A1*28 is characterized by the presence of an additional TA repeat in the TATA sequence of the UGT1A1
promoter [(TA)7TAA, instead of (TA)6TAA]. Fragment
analysis determines fragment size with a 211-nucleotide
fragment for the 6 TA repeats and a 213-nucleotide fragment for the 7 TA repeats. Genotype data were available
for 329 patients.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analysis included an analysis of the risk of
severe adverse effects in irinotecan-treated colorectal cancer patients and an analysis of the survival of irinotecantreated patients. The adverse effects analysis included 214
patients with full treatment information and genotype
who were also among the 329 patients included in the
survival analysis genotype data. The association between
UGT1A1*28 genotypes and demographic variables were
tested using chi-square tests (exact test when appropriate).
The association between UGT1A1*28 genotype and
the incidence of grade 3-4 toxicities were tested using
Armitage test for trend. Similarly, the association with
toxicity-related hospitalization mortality (death within 2
months of treatment initiation) was assessed. Overall survival was calculated from the date of first metastases (or recurrence) diagnosis to date of death or final date of study
participation. Overall survival was presented using
Kaplan-Meier curves and was compared using a log-rank
test. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to

2). However, the 6/6 genotype tended to be diagnosed
with a lower proportion of stage 4.
Treatment Characteristics
Treatment protocols in our series included FOLFIRI
(38%), IFL (41%), and other regimens (XELIRI, TEGAFIRI [21%]). No difference in treatment protocols was
noted between the groups with different genotypes (Table
3). In the overall irinotecan-treated series, treatment was
initiated at a median time of 48 weeks after initial diagnosis, and 12 weeks from diagnosis of metastases or recurrence with a wide time range. Patients with the 6/6
genotype had a significantly longer time to treatment start

than patients with the 6/7 or 7/7 genotype (62 weeks versus 39 weeks and 42 weeks, respectively) (Table 3). This
longer time was a reflection of a significantly longer time
to development of metastases/recurrence and was not due
to differences in time of treatment initiation after metastases were detected.
Drug Toxicity
Among the 214 patients who had detailed treatment and
toxicity information, a total of 164 grade 3-4 toxicity
events were reported in 98 (46.9%) patients. The most
common toxicity events were diarrhea (22.4%), vomiting
(9.8%), leucopenia (9.3%), neutropenia (8.9%),

Original Article

infection (5.1%), neutropenic fever (3.7%), and mucositis (1.4%) (Table 4).
The median (interquartile range) time from start of
treatment to appearance of the first event of grade 3-4
toxicity was 5.9 (2.1-8.6) weeks for the UGT1A1*28 6/6
genotype and 3.1 (2.1-5.9) weeks for the 6/7 genotype,
and the shortest time was 2.1 (1.2-3.1) weeks for patients
with the 7/7 genotype (P ¼ .016).
Hematological toxicity was significantly more common in patients with the 7/7 genotype, (48% compared
with 10.2% and 7.7% in the 6/7 and 6/6 genotypes; P
for trend <.001). A similar elevated event rate was
observed for leucopenia, neutropenia, and neutropenic
fever (Table 4).
There were no significant differences between
patients with the genetic subtypes in the rate of nonhematological grade 3-4 toxicities, although vomiting was
found to be significantly increased with an additional
copy of a 7 allele.
Hospitalization due to toxicity was recorded in 48
patients (23%). The frequency of hospitalization was significantly higher among the 7/7 genotype group (45.8%)
compared with the 6/6 group (14.4%) and 6/7 group
(25.3%) (P for trend ¼ .01). The median number of hospitalization days, for patients who were hospitalized, was
similar across genotype groups (6, 5, and 5 for the 6/6, 6/
7, and 7/7, respectively).
The pattern of increased toxicity and increased hospitalization rate among patients with the 7/7 genotype was
noted in all treatment protocol types (data not shown).
When toxicity analysis was stratified by ethnicity,
the apparent association of the 7 allele with increased
hematological grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in both
Jewish and non-Jewish patients (data not shown).
Seventeen deaths were observed in the 2-month period after the start of irinotecan-based treatment. Death
rates significantly increased with an additional copy of the
7 allele (2.9%, 5.2%, and 12.8% for the 6/6, 6/7, and 7/7
genotypes, respectively; P for trend ¼ .027).
Overall Survival
Among the 329 patients available for this analysis, a total
of 286 deaths of any cause (86.9%) occurred during the
follow-up period, which started at the date of first metastasis or local recurrence event. The median follow-up period (from event) was 2 years (6 years for patients who
were alive at the end of the follow-up period).
The median overall survival for the 3 genotype
groups was significantly different (2.4, 2.0, and 1.6 years

patients with the 7/7 genotype and the 6/6 genotype,
when adjusted for age and stage at diagnosis (stage 4 vs
other), was 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.5).
When analysis was stratified according to ethnicity, the
adjusted HR comparing the 7/7 genotype with the 6/6 genotype was 1.6 (95% CI, 1.0-2.5) for Jewish patients and
2.2 (95% CI, 0.99-5.0) for non-Jewish patients. The age/
stage/ethnicity-adjusted HR for death in patients with the
7/7 genotype compared with the 6/6 genotype was 1.7
(95% CI, 1.1-2.3; P ¼ .010).
Analysis of survival from time of initial diagnosis
yielded similar results, with worse survival for the 7/7 genotype (median survival time of 3.5, 2.8, and 2.1 years for
the 6/6, 6/7, and 7/7 genotypes, respectively; P ¼ .003
[log-rank test]) (Figure 2) and an elevated age/stage/ethnicity-adjusted HR for death for the 7/7 genotype of 1.6
(95% CI, 1.1-2.4; P ¼ .015).

DISCUSSION
Our data suggest a significantly higher rate of complications and worse survival among irinotecan-treated
patients with advanced colorectal cancer who carry the
7/7 variant of UGT1A1*28.
Our finding of a higher rate of grade 3-4 toxicity in
irinotecan-treated patients who were carriers of the 7/7
variant is in line with findings in most other studies with
different treatment protocols.5-16 A previously reported

interval, 1.1-2.4; P ¼ .015).

meta-analysis11 suggested that such higher toxicity of at
least hematological adverse effects is only seen when treatments with doses >150 mg/m2 were employed. Although
we were unable to retrospectively calculate the exact doses
given to our patients, the treatment protocols used in our
study suggest that most patients were likely within the
range of commonly used low-dose therapeutics. The
many different irinotecan treatment regimens (eg, IFL,
capecitabin/irinotecan, raltitrexed/irinotecan, FOLFIRI,
FOLFOXIRI) used in the different trials included in the
meta-analysis could make it difficult to compare their
results with ours.
In our data, no events of neutropenic fever were
noticed among individuals with the 6/6 variant. This is in
line with a recent UGT1A1 genotype-driven phase 1 study
of irinotecan18 that demonstrated the possibility of irinotecan dose escalation in patients with UGT1A1 wild-type
homozygous TA6/TA6 of up to 370 mg/m2 every 2
weeks. We see great importance in further investigation of
the UGT 1A1 genotype dose-response relationship, evaluation of the clinical effectiveness, and use of UGT1A1
genotyping as related to true clinical benefit of different
irinotecan protocols.
Whereas most irinotecan pharmacogenetic trials
have focused on the predictive role of UGT1A1 variants
on toxicity, only a few trials have evaluated the prognostic
value of these genetic markers.7,8 Our study demonstrated
a clear survival advantage for wild-type variants among
patients who were treated with irinotecan of any regimen.

A prospective study7 with a comparable study population
reported limited higher hematological toxicity in 22 FOLFIRI-treated carriers of the 7/7 variant and found that
these patients also had a higher response rate but no significant survival difference. However, their median follow-up time was only 15 months, within which only 52%
of the participants died. A second retrospective smaller
study8 in a Chinese population did not detect any association between the genetic status and progression-free or
overall survival, but had only 6 patients with the 7/7 variant. Our much longer follow-up time, with a median
overall survival as high as 2.4 years, together with our
larger number of participants (especially carriers of the 7/7
variant), could explain the difference between our findings
and the findings of other studies. Possible explanations for
a survival disadvantage in 7/7 carriers of the UGT1A1
gene include suboptimal treatment due to the severity of
adverse effects and discontinuation of treatment. In addition, the mutation that influences glucoronidation processes in the liver could be of wider importance, because
the liver is not only the leading site of metastases development in colorectal cancer patients, it is also the metabolic
site of many other chemotherapeutic agents. If these factors are of importance, a survival disadvantage of 7/7 carriers would also be expected in patients who have not
been treated with irinotecan-based regimen. To our
knowledge, such data have not yet been reported yet.
The source of data for these analyses was a comprehensive population-based series of colorectal cancer
patients diagnosed in Israel over the past decade. In this
sense, these data represent a real-life experience of patients
not involved in clinical trials, but rather being treated
according to commonly used protocols. Therefore, our
retrospective data might have a certain level of selection
bias, because decisions about treatment initiation and
type of treatment could differ between doctors and
patients. This is a possible explanation for different irinotecan administration protocols in our study population.
Another possible weakness of studies performed outside a
trial setup could be a difference in quality of collected
data. We had to rely on data that appeared in the medical
records, but we were also able to rely on electronic records
that have a close to absolute validity for events such as
death, hospitalization, length of hospitalization, and
more. Regardless of the possibility of selection bias and information bias, there is no reason to expect them to differentially influence our results, because the genetic status
of the involved patients was not known to the treating
physicians or study researchers at time of treatment. In

addition, the prevalence of the 7/7 variant in our series
was similar to the prevalence of the variant reported in
other Caucasian populations. Genotyping for UGT1A1
was not incorporated into clinical practice or treatment
choices for the patients included in our population-based
study, thus the total proportion of patients with the 7/7
variant treated with irinotecan-based regimens is similar
to the overall prevalence of the variant. Chemotherapy
regimens and dosages were not influenced by genotype at
the time these patients were treated.
UGT1A1*28 7/7 genotype is strongly associated
with severe toxicity and hospitalizations and with lower
overall survival in patients with advanced disease treated
with irinotecan. These data support the US Food and
Drug Administration’s recommendation and product
labeling to tailor treatment plans for patients with colorectal cancer.
