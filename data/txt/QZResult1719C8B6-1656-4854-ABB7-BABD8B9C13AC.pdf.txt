ancer chemotherapy or ‘chemical therapy’ in the narrowest
sense is used to refer to genotoxic drugs that were developed in
the 1940s for the treatment of cancer. Breakthroughs in molecular
biology and the widespread adoption of bioinformatics and highthroughput ‘-omic’ (eg, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, etc)
approaches have shed some light into the search for distinctive molecular signatures pertinent to ‘rational’ therapy against targets that
are relevant in various disease processes such as cancer. In this
review, we present a concise summary of systemic cancer therapy
over the last 60 years focusing in detail on the au courant paradigm
in cancer therapeutics that continues to evolve in the new millennium.

Brief History
The concept of treating cancer with drugs goes back more than 500
years when preparations of mercury, silver, and zinc were used. The
first documented case of cancer chemotherapy, however, was by Lissauer in 1865.1 He gave Fowler solution (potassium arsenite) to a
patient with leukemia with ‘beneficial effects.’ A precursor of current
targeted cancer therapy is another 19th century discovery that laid

the groundwork for antiestrogen therapies in breast
cancer when Schinzinger first proposed surgical
oophorectomy in 1889 as a treatment for breast cancer.2 Historic credit for this intervention has been
accorded subsequently to Beatson, who first reported
in 1896 the complete remission of a patient with
advanced breast cancer after bilateral oophorectomy.3
The modern era of chemotherapy started when
the war gas sulfur mustard was used in patients in
1931,4 first topically and then by direct intratumoral
injection, but was believed to be too toxic for human
use. The second-generation mustard, nitrogen mustard, was tested subsequently by Gilman et al, first in
mice and then in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the 1940s, extrapolating from the autopsy
findings of lymphoid hypoplasia and myelosuppression in soldiers who had been exposed to the sulfur
mustard gas during the First World War.5 Further
investigation of the mustard agents defined the
mechanism of action based on alkylation of DNA,
thus spurring the subsequent development of newer
generation alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil. Closely after along the trail
of discovery were the antimetabolites, with the antifolates aminopterin and methotrexate representing
the first agents in this class of drugs to show therapeutic efficacy by inducing remission in children
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) based on
the observation that folate supplementation accelerated the proliferation of leukemic cells in children
with ALL.6,7
From these beginnings arose the enthusiasm in
promoting drug discovery for cancer. In 1950, anthracyclines that possessed antibacterial activity were
isolated from a soil streptomycete, although their
clinical use was limited because of toxicity.8 Screening of soil isolates subsequently was pursued formally in the search for anticancer compounds
derived from antimicrobial antibiotics. In the ensuing
2 decades, testing of natural products from plant and
marine sources led to the discovery of agents such as
the vinca alkaloids, the taxanes, and camptothecins.9
Then, it was demonstrated that cisplatin had antitumor activity in the 1960s, a discovery that arose from
a series of experiments prompted by a serendipitous
finding that electrical fields were inhibiting the cell
division of Escherichia coli.10
In conjunction with drug discovery were investigations on tumor growth kinetics, which constitute
the theoretic framework of cancer chemotherapy.
Skipper et al demonstrated the exponential (logarithmic) growth of tumor cells and, conversely, proposed
the log kill hypothesis that drug therapy will elimi-

nate a constant proportion rather than a constant
number of tumor cells regardless of the initial size of
the tumor.11 If sufficient drug is administered, then a
cure is attained when less than 1 tumor cell remains.
Those investigators also provided the hypothetical
groundwork for high-dose chemotherapy (with bone
marrow/stem cell transplantation as rescue) in the
cure of refractory malignancies based on the doseresponse antitumor effect of conventional cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic drugs. Indeed, clinical aspects
underlying the principles of chemotherapy, such as
the intermittent use of drugs, the use of agents with
nonoverlapping toxicities, and the practice of administering the maximum tolerated dose of a specific
anticancer drug, rest on this dose-response relation.
Although the work is seminal, the log kill model
described by Skipper et al is applicable largely only
to malignancies in which the proliferating fraction of
cells constitutes the bulk or entirety of the malignant
process, such as leukemias. For solid tumors, experimental data support the Gompertzian model of sigmoidal tumor growth. This relies on the NortonSimon hypothesis that log kill will be greatest when
tumor burden is at a minimum, as in micrometastatic states.12 However, because tumor growth likewise is fastest in this setting, tumor eradication is
difficult and is achieved best by minimizing the time
interval between drug therapies, thus giving rise to
dose-dense regimens. In the North American Intergroup factorial trial design (Cancer and Leukemia
Group B trial 9741), the concept of dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy was tested in patients with
lymph node-positive breast cancer. In keeping with
the prediction based on the Norton-Simon hypothesis, the dose-dense schedule proved superior to the
standard schedule.13
Another core concept is the importance of combination chemotherapy using agents with different
mechanisms of action and resistance. This is based
in part on the hypothesis of Goldie and Coldman
that drug resistance can arise from spontaneous
mutations and will occur inevitably with cell proliferation and that these mutations occur at a rate of 1
of 105 cells. If 1 gram of tumor contains 109 cells,
then 104 clones that are resistant to any given drug
will be present. However, resistance to 2 drugs would
be observed in fewer than 1 cell in 1010 (10 g) tumor.14 Combination chemotherapy became an established practice when more patients were cured
successfully of lymphomas and leukemias using regimens that consisted of multiple drugs, whereas most
remissions previously were short-lived after singleagent therapies and were limited to few tumors (eg,
choriocarcinomas, Burkitt lymphoma). Conversely,

Novel Systemic Cancer Therapies/Dy and Adjei

the use of alternating regimens in theory would be a
superior strategy over a sequential use of different
regimens based on this hypothesis if all potential
combination of drugs were used early upfront to
minimize the emergence of drug resistance. However,
the converse was demonstrated in the study reported
by Bonadonna et al comparing alternating and sequential dose schedules of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) given
simultaneously in combination with doxorubicin
(A) for patients with high-risk stage II breast cancer.
A sequential regimen consisting of 4 courses of
doxorubicin followed by 8 courses of CMF
(A 3 4?CMF 3 4) resulted in better long-term disease-free and overall survival (OS) compared with an
alternating regimen of 2 courses of CMF followed by
1 course of doxorubicin, repeated for 4 cycles
([CMF2?A] 3 4).15,16 It is interesting to note that, in
some fashion, that the sequential approach produced
superior results is predicted by the Norton-Simon hypothesis, because 4 consecutive administrations of
doxorubicin, which is believed to be more effective
than CMF, take less time and thus are more ‘dosedense’ than an alternating approach.

The 21st Century
Signaling networks as targets
The past decade marked the beginning of a transitional era in cancer therapy from DNA/mitosis-based
mechanisms to strategies manipulating the dysregulated molecular pathways that characterize the malignant phenotype. Indeed, this ‘targeted’ approach is
not an entirely novel concept and has its roots in the
hormonal interventions for the treatment of breast,
prostate, and neuroendocrine cancers. Moreover, the
seminal concept of the contribution of the tumor
stroma and microenvironment to carcinogenesis first
proposed in the late 19th century finally has gained
widespread acceptance; thus, therapeutic interventions to manipulate processes such as angiogenesis,
cell adhesion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition are being studied.
Because there exist complex, nonlinear interactions with multiple redundant, hierarchical intersections and feedback loops occurring among the key
targets in signaling pathways, targeted agents commonly affect multiple aspects of cancer biology
simultaneously. Thus, it is not surprising to find that
the drugs that modulate signal transduction affect
not only the primary biologic pathway of their respective targets, whether those targets include the
induction of cell cycle arrest, antiangiogenesis, or apoptosis, but they often yield a combination of effects.
A comprehensive discussion of each relevant signal-

1859

ing pathway is beyond the scope of this review;
therefore, we refer interested readers to reviews
detailing the basic biology of the various signaling
networks. Figure 1 is a simplified diagram encapsulating the key ‘nodes’ in the signaling networks
against which several drugs already are in clinical
use or in late stages of clinical development. Table 1
summarizes the findings in the pivotal trials of the
novel agents discussed in this review.

Approaches to Target Modulation
In discussing novel agents that have been introduced
into the clinic over the last decade, it is important to
distinguish drug targets from the methods and technologies that have been used to inhibit these targets.
There are 3 broad categories of technologies used in
the rational design of new drugs that modulate target
protein interactions in tumors: 1) immunologic, 2)
nucleic acids, 3) and small molecules. Table 2 lists
the context-dependent advantages and disadvantages
with the clinical application of each approach. The
immunologic approach currently is dominated by
the use of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), typically
to disrupt ligand-receptor interactions. A major obstacle encountered in the early phases of development included the development of neutralizing
antibodies and hypersensitivity reactions because of
the murine derivation (-momab) of the initial compounds. These problems essentially are circumvented
with techniques to reduce immunogenicity through
chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab), or fully
human MoAbs (-mumab).
Surface-expressed tumor-associated antigens
have been exploited therapeutically using MoAb
strategy. However, it is important to recognize that
many of the purported tumor-derived proteins are in
fact lineage-specific differentiation antigens that are
observed in normal tissues.17 Therefore, targeting
such markers is complicated by effects on tumor
cells as well as normal cells. Moreover, tumor cells
are predisposed toward dedifferentiation and thus, in
fact, may express less surface receptors, such as the
expression of CD20 in B cells.18 Nonetheless, this
approach has been successful in the treatment of hematopoietic tumors, as exemplified by rituximab, a
chimeric monoclonal anti-CD20 immunoglobulin G1
(IgG1) used in the treatment of B-lymphoproliferative
malignancies. Other examples are listed in Table 3.
The high degree of target specificity of antibodies
counterbalances inherent undesirable pharmaceutical properties, such as structural complexity, large
molecular weight, physiologic barriers to intratumoral uptake, and heterogeneous antibody distribution within tumors, enough to make them one of the

success stories in novel drug development for solid
tumors, as exemplified by cetuximab and trastuzumab.19 Moreover, antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-mediated cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis are nontarget
mechanisms that can contribute to the antitumor efficacy of MoAbs.20,21 In addition, MoAbs can be labeled readily or conjugated with other biologic
agents for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. However, because of the challenges associated with
achieving satisfactory tissue distribution and intratumoral concentrations, MoAb strategies most likely
will not be as effective against bulky lesions, as
demonstrated by the clinical experience with alemtuzumab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in
which patients with leukemic-phase disease respond
better than patients with bulky adenopathy.22,23 This
also is applicable to radioimmunotherapy, although
the ability to effect additional nontarget events, such
as the radiobiologic bystander effect, confers an

additional advantage against tumor cells that otherwise would have escaped immunotargeting alone.
Antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and aptamers
constitute the major technologies in cancer therapeutics that use the nucleic acid approach. An ASO
is a single-stranded, chemically modified, DNA-like
molecule 17 to 22 nucleotides in length that can
selectively inhibit posttranscriptional gene expression
through complementary nucleic acid hybridization,
thus sterically hindering the translation of a specific
gene messenger RNA (mRNA) and/or, through
recruitment of RNase H, to cleave the target
mRNA.24 Subcategories of the nucleic acid technology include the catalytic sequence-specific RNA and
DNA enzymes (ribozymes and DNAzymes, respectively), which cleave target RNA substrates, and
short-interefering RNA molecules, which degrade target mRNA through a multicomponent enzyme complex.25 Because multiple copies of a protein are
produced by each mRNA molecule, targeting mRNA

rather than the protein itself is potentially a more efficient approach to modulate protein function by
altering its levels, particularly of targets that cannot
be manipulated directly by MoAbs or small molecule
inhibitors, such as transcription factors. However,
there remain several technical obstacles to the successful clinical application of this technology in
terms of sequence design and delivery (eg, a platform providing efficiency of cell uptake and metabolic stability against degradation by ubiquitous
nucleases), including the stimulation of nontarget
effects, perhaps the most significant of which is the
unintended stimulation of proinflammatory and
immune responses presumably through Toll-like receptor activation,26 although this last finding has
opened up new avenues for modulation of the
immune system. More recently, despite the theoretical advantages of RNA interference (RNAi) technology, reports of fatal hepatotoxicity in mice have led
to safety concerns for therapeutic applications of
RNAi.27 A lesson learned from this as well as from
the disappointing clinical results using antisense
technologies against targets that otherwise have
demonstrated their relevance using other approaches, such as the vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor (VEGFR) mRNA ribozyme Angiozyme,
is that clinical failure of a new drug does not necessarily mean that the target is not ideal for cancer
therapeutics.
Whereas ASO and RNAi strategies alter target
protein levels, aptamers, which are synthetic, short
nucleic acid ligands made from RNA and DNA generated by in vitro systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment technology that can fold into
stable, 3-dimensional structures, possess binding
affinities and specificities that are comparable to or
even better than MoAbs28 and, thus, may interact at
the ligand-receptor interface as well. Similarly, aptamers may be engineered to act as ‘escorts’ delivering
radionuclides, etc, for diagnostic and therapeutic
purposes.29 Moreover, the small size of aptamers
facilitates tissue penetration. On the basis of lessons
learned from ASO, most aptamers currently possess
structural features to enhance nuclease resistance.
Another important feature is that they essentially are
nonimmunogenic even when administered in excess
of therapeutic doses. Nevertheless, for intracellular
targets, effective intracellular delivery remains a significant challenge in common with other nucleic
acid technologies.
The clinical success of small molecule inhibitors
parallels that of MoAbs in cancer therapy. The ability
to modulate intracellular targets confers a distinct
advantage over MoAbs, for instance, in situations in

1861

which the small molecule inhibitors can block the
catalytic activity of mutant receptor kinases that lack
an extracellular domain and are active constitutively
in a ligand-independent fashion, eg, the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant EGFRvIII in
glioblastomas.30,31 These versatile molecules are well
suited to alter target intracellular or extracellular proteins either qualitatively or quantitatively. Target protein activity can be affected either directly, such as
inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, or indirectly
by affecting posttranslational modification of the target protein, such as farnesylation of ras. Conversely,
target protein levels may be altered by several
means, such as through epigenetic regulation (eg, inhibition of histone deacetylases [HDACs]) or through
degradation pathways either directly by modulating
proteasomal activity (eg, bortezomib) or indirectly
through interference with chaperone functions (eg,
17-allylamino demethoxygeldanamlycin) of heat
shock protein 90 (HSP90), which then lead to degradation of target HSP90 client proteins by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway.
Imatinib was the prototype small molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase (TK) domains of c-kit,
platelet-derived growth factor (PDFR) receptor
(PDGFR), and c-abl. Druggable molecular targets
that are amenable to modulation by drugs (as
defined by the Lipinski rule of 5) are gene products
largely dominated by protein kinases, and 518 of
those kinases have been described to date in the
human kinome.32 Although the concept of ‘druggability’ is distinct and separate from the validity of a
chosen drug target, both are necessary considerations in drug development. Because protein kinases
are involved in a variety of intracellular signaling
processes crucial for biologic functions, such as apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cell cycle regulation, enthusiasm continues for the development of protein
kinase inhibitors as cancer therapy.
Although initial designs for small molecules
were focused on achieving high target specificity
based on the rationale of minimizing off-target side
effects, subsequent experience revealed that ‘promiscuous’ drugs, such as adenosine triphosphate
(ATP)-mimetic drugs, with pleiotropic targets arising
from close homology between related protein kinases, in fact, possess a favorable efficacy profile
over a wider spectrum of malignant disorders. This is
not entirely surprising because of the well known, inherent redundancy and overlap in biologic response
pathways and because the ‘mono-oncogenic’ model
of carcinogenesis is restricted to only a few examples.
This pleiotropism in fact has led to several serendipitous clinical findings, such as the case of sorafenib,

Ligand-Receptor Interface
EGFR-mediated pathway
Mirroring the drug developmental path after the discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML), the discovery by Cohen
et al in the 1950s of epidermal growth factor (EGF)
and subsequently, the establishment of the pathogenic role in neoplastic diseases of the EGF signaling
pathway catalyzed efforts to develop EGFR-directed
therapies. Because it is the most studied, we select
the EGFR TK system as a prototype to demonstrate
the highly regulated nature of signaling networks. It
is characterized by an hourglass or bow-tie architecture,34 whereby multiple inputs (13 growth factor
ligands with conserved EGF domains) received by a
permutation of dimeric receptors arising from 4 distinctive receptors of the erBb family (EGFR, HER-2,
HER-3, and HER-4), are funneled through second
messengers and transcription factors that amplify the
signals through multiple pathways, such as Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), toward a wide base of myriad biologic processes. A key feature integral to the understanding of
the therapeutic manipulation of the EGFR pathway is
that EGFR, in its typical unligated form, is in an

autoinhibited ‘closed’ conformation.35,36 Growth factors function to unfurl the receptor into an ‘open’
conformation that can dimerize through the exposed
dimerization arm at domain II of the extracellular
region.37 Another important finding to recognize is
that HER-2, despite its lack of ligand-binding activity
and autonomous function, is the preferred heterodimeric partner of the 3 other receptors.38 This is
because of the structural nature of HER-2, which
constitutively assumes a receptive, ‘open’ conformational structure with an extended domain II arm that
mimics the ligand-bound state of EGFR. These heterodimers induce greater mitogenic effects because
of higher ligand affinity and evasion of receptor degradation, in contrast to ligand-induced receptor
endocytosis with subsequent endosomal degradation
of EGFR dimers.39
Cetuximab is a chimeric MoAb that avidly competes with and sterically blocks access of growth factors to a key ligand-binding region of EGFR. It is
approved for treatment, either alone or in combination with irinotecan, in patients with irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancers (CRCs).40 In patients with
recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancers,
cetuximab is approved as a single agent after failure
of prior platinum-based therapy.41 It increases firstline response rates and, in combination with cisplatin, survival was not improved; however, the study
was not powered adequately, and crossover was
allowed.42,43 A larger study subsequently demon-

strated a survival advantage 43 On the basis of preclinical evidence that demonstrated synergistic activity
with ionizing radiation and a subsequent phase 3
trial that demonstrated a survival benefit, currently,
cetuximab also is approved in combination with
radiotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with
locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of
the head and neck.44,45
Cetuximab currently is undergoing further evaluation in combination with chemotherapy given in
the adjuvant setting to patients with CRC. First-line
combination with systemic chemotherapy and bevacizumab therapy also is being tested in ongoing ran-

domized phase 3 trials. Because of favorable activity
in early phase 2 studies in nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer, several randomized
phase 3 trials were conducted. An open-label phase
3 study that included >600 patients from the US
and Canada tested the combination of cetuximab
plus a taxane and carboplatin in the first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC. This trial did not meet
its primary endpoint of progression-free survival
(PFS), as assessed by an independent radiology
review committee (IRRC). However, key secondary
endpoints of the study, including response rate as
assessed by the IRRC and PFS as assessed by clinical

1868

CANCER Supplement

October 1, 2008 / Volume 113 / Number 7

investigators, were statistically significant and
favored the cetuximab-containing arm.46 Similarly,
analysis of the Southwest Oncology Group phase 3
randomized study that enrolled >700 patients
demonstrated no significant difference in outcomes
when cetuximab was added to gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine alone in the first-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.47 Data from
phase 3 trials investigating first-line treatment of
cetuximab with cisplatin/vinorelbine in advanced
EGFR-expressing NSCLC, as well as irinotecan and
docetaxel with or without cetuximab in patients
with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, are
eagerly awaited.
Whereas nontarget immunologic effects (eg,
ADCC) may be mediated by cetuximab because of its
IgG1 isotype, the IgG2 isotype used in the fully
humanized panitumumab precludes immunologic
mechanisms contributing to its efficacy. It is more
potent and does not require prophylaxis against
hypersensitivity reaction; and, because of its longer
half-life, it may be given on a biweekly schedule. It
also has shown single-agent activity in metastatic
CRC after failure of standard chemotherapy compared with best supportive care, although the crossover design likely accounted for the lack of an OS
advantage.48 However, the phase 3 Panitumumab
Advanced Colorectal Cancer Evaluation trial in firstline metastatic CRC testing the combination of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin (FOLFOX) plus
bevacizumab with or without panitumumab was discontinued in March 2007, because a preplanned interim efficacy analysis revealed PFS in favor of the
control arm.49
Gefitinib is the first EGFR TK inhibitor (TKI) that
has received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) based on encouraging phase 2 data results, with the stipulation that
postmarketing trials be conducted, including the
Iressa Survival Evaluation in Lung Cancer study, a
randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study that
was designed to assess the survival advantage of
gefitinib versus best supportive care in patients
with advanced NSCLC who were refractory to or
intolerant of their latest chemotherapy regimen.50
Preplanned subgroup analyses demonstrated heterogeneity in survival outcome, such that survival was
better in the gefitinib group than in the placebo group
among never-smokers and among patients of Asian
origin in contrast to the similar outcomes between
treatment and placebo among smokers or patients of
non-Asian origin. These were similar to the findings
with the phase 3 data from the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group Study BR.21 using

erlotinib, another oral EGFR TKI.51 Unlike erlotinib,
however, primary survival endpoints were not met in
the gefitinib trial. An explanation often repeated is that
gefitinib dosing was suboptimal in contrast to the
counterpart trial in erlotinib that used dosing at the
maximum tolerated dose level. A phase 3 survival
study (the Iressa NSCLC Trial Evaluating Response and
Survival Against Taxotere or INTEREST study), however, recently demonstrated noninferiority of gefitinib
compared with docetaxel with superior safety on the
gefitinib arm.52,53
Overexpression or gene amplification of Her-2/
neu, which occurs in 20% to 30% of breast cancers,
predicts for a poor clinical outcome and for resistance to chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Trastuzumab is an HER-2 MoAb that exhibits single-agent
activity, either as first-line54 or salvage therapy,55 and
also has synergistic activity with chemotherapy in
metastatic breast cancers that over express Her2/
neu.56 More recently, enthusiasm for this drug was
enhanced by the stunning survival outcomes confirmed by several phase 3 trials, B-31, N9831, and
Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA), which incorporated trastuzumab maintenance for 1 to 2 years in the adjuvant treatment setting in breast cancer.57,58 Even
more compelling was the observation from the joint
analysis that demonstrated the virtual elimination of
the early peak in recurrences generally observed during the first 2 to 3 years after a breast cancer diagnosis.57 Although the risk of cardiotoxicity seems lower
with the sequential administration of trastuzumab
and chemotherapy, optimal timing of trastuzumab
therapy (sequential vs concurrently with paclitaxel)
has yet to be determined. An intriguing finding from
the Finland Herceptin (FinHer) study, another randomized phase 3 trial that introduced a twist in the
schedule of trastuzumab therapy, was that survival
outcomes from the subset of patients with HER-2/
neu-overexpressing breast cancer were superimposable with those from the collective data reported by
Romond et al despite a shorter course (9 weekly
doses) of trastuzumab preceding administration of
an anthracycline-containing regimen.57,59 The early
results from that study suggest that a shortened duration of trastuzumab therapy before anthracycline
exposure may limit cardiotoxicity without compromising efficacy. Definitive answers regarding the timing and duration of trastuzumab therapy hopefully
will be available with more mature data from these
trials in the ensuing years.
However, not all Her2/neu-overexpressing breast
cancers respond to trastuzumab, which most likely is
a function of the weak inhibitory activity of trastuzumab against the formation of HER-2 heterodimers,

Novel Systemic Cancer Therapies/Dy and Adjei

as in the kinase-defective HER-3, which, in turn, activates the PI3K signaling pathway.60 Emerging crystallographic data revealed the structural mechanism
that may explain this finding. Because trastuzumab
binds to domain IV of the extracellular region, the
dimerization domain II arm of Her2 is left exposed
and poised for coupling.60,61 Pertuzumab, conversely,
binds to domain II and, thus, disrupts heterodimerization and subsequent signaling activity.60 Because
trastuzumab and pertuzumab have nonoverlapping
effects on receptor shedding and endocytosis, these
2 MoAbs in combination provide complementary
action, as evident in the synergistic activity
observed.62 Preliminary results from a phase 2 trial
investigating this combination in 42 patients with
HER-2-positive metastatic breast cancer who progressed after trastuzumab therapy indicated promising results, including complete responses, which
have led to an ongoing phase 3 trial of the combination in this patient population.63 Also of interest is
that, although HER-2 overexpression/gene amplification in ovarian/primary peritoneal cancer is low and
trastuzumab has marginal value as monotherapy,
early exploratory analysis of data from 130 patients
enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, placebocontrolled phase 2 trial of gemcitabine with or without pertuzumab for women with platinum-resistant
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer
indicated improved overall PFS among the patients
who received the combination.64 Although the data
are immature, there are promising correlative data
that may help identify the appropriate patient population for treatment, because patients with higher
HER-2 to HER-3 gene expression ratios appeared to
derive a significant PFS benefit from this combination therapy.
We can surmise from the discussion above of the
EGFR family of receptors that simultaneous inhibition of EGFR and HER-2 may be a suitable approach
for drug therapy. Indeed, abundant preclinical evidence set the stage for the development of the dual
TK inhibitor lapatinib (GW572016). Unlike erlotinib,
which dissociates rapidly upon binding to the active
conformation of EGFR, lapatinib has a slow dissociation rate after it is bound, and the lapatinib/EGFR
complex is characterized as in an inactive-like conformation.65 Results from an international, randomized phase 3 study that compared capecitabine
with or without lapatinib in patients who had disease
progression after trastuzumab treatment were disclosed early after interim analyses showed that the
primary time-to-progression (TTP) endpoint was
exceeded favorably, as determined by independent
reviewers. The median TTP was 8.4 months in the

1869

combination therapy group compared with 4.4
months in the monotherapy group.66 Because that
study was halted early, and crossover was allowed
subsequently, the actual survival benefit may have
been obscured. Although there were no serious toxic
or symptomatic cardiac events reported, definite
conclusions regarding cardiotoxicity are premature at
this juncture. An interesting observation, although
limited by the small number of events, was that
brain metastases developed in fewer women who
received the lapatinib combination compared with
women in the monotherapy group. A phase 2 study
of lapatinib for brain metastases in patients with
HER-2-positive breast cancer, although it did not
meet its primary endpoint of objective response
(defined by Response Criteria in Solid Tumors), provided evidence that lapatinib induced a volumetric
reduction of brain metastases.67 The latest results
from the extension trial involving 49 patients in
which capecitabine was added to lapatinib when
brain metastases progressed on lapatinib monotherapy demonstrated that 37% of patients experienced a
volumetric decrease 20%, and patients who
received combination therapy experienced a volumetric reduction 50% in measurable brain metastases.68,69 Lapatinib currently is being studied in
several other randomized phase 3 breast cancer
trials, including first-line therapy in combination
with paclitaxel or antiangiogenic agents, such as
pazopanib for metastatic disease; in the adjuvant setting with trastuzumab; and neoadjuvantly with
chemotherapy or hormone therapy using letrozole.
Conversely, there is a limited role for lapatinib in
prostate cancer, gastric cancer, and renal cell cancer
(RCC).70-72 Subset analyses from an RCC trial, however, demonstrated that patients who had tumors
that overexpressed EGFR derived a benefit from lapatinib compared with hormone therapy. This finding
will require further investigation.

The tenets surrounding the role of the tumor microenvironment started from the ‘seed-and-soil’ hypothesis described by Paget in 1889 and are supported by
evidence in recent times demonstrating the interdependent roles of cancer cells, neighboring stromal
cells, tissue macrophages, and the intercellular matrix. The purification of VEGF-A a century later in
198973 and subsequent preclinical evidence that targeting this ligand74 can suppress angiogenesis and
tumor growth in preclinical models led to the recognition of the crucial role played by underlying vasculature and angiogenesis in carcinogenesis. Similar to
the EGF system, multiple signal inputs are mediated

through 5 distinct receptors in the VEGFR system.
Although VEGF165 is the isoform implicated most in
angiogenesis and vascular permeability, other isoforms, such as VEGF121 and VEGF110, are potent
permeability factors, and blocking these isoforms
likely will contribute to greater efficacy. This is supported by the clinical findings that an Fab fragment
that binds to all isoforms of VEGF-A potentially is
more effective than pegaptanib, an aptamer against
VEGF165, in age-related macular degeneration.75
Bevacizumab is a humanized MoAb against all
isoforms of VEGF-A that is the first antiangiogenic
agent to be approved for therapeutic use. Despite the
concern that antiangiogenic agents will impede drug
delivery by their very mechanism of action, in fact,
preclinical evidence indicates that, with normalization of aberrant vessels that are often leaky, reduction in vascular permeability and intratumor pressure
leads to improved drug delivery.76 It has shown
improved survival in combination with standard
therapy in patients with CRC, lung cancer, and (most
recently) RCC.77-81 Early phase 2 studies in recurrent
ovarian cancer, either as a single-agent or in combination with chemotherapy, have produced promising
results tempered by a higher than expected incidence
of bowel perforation.82-84 Nonetheless, the limited efficacy as monotherapy, the context-dependent clinical benefit with combination regimens (a survival
benefit in either the first-line or second-line setting
in CRC but a TTP benefit only in the first-line setting
in breast cancer; no benefit in the first-line setting in
pancreatic cancer85) the survival benefit in RCC
observed in patients with favorable-risk and intermediate-risk features (Motzer criteria) raises more questions than answers. Multiple phase 3 trials
incorporating bevacizumab in combination with various chemotherapy, antiestrogen, or novel agents (eg,
imatinib) in the metastatic setting and in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting are ongoing or soon will be
initiated.
Although the potential therapeutic use of antiVEGF therapies against RCC first was demonstrated
clinically using bevacizumab, based on the observation that mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)
gene that cause the over secretion of VEGF occur frequently in clear cell RCC, randomized phase 3 results
demonstrating efficacy in RCC were reported first in
multitargeted TKIs. Moreover, there is phase 2 clinical evidence that multitargeted agents may be effective in bevacizumab-resistant RCC.86 Sunitinib
(SU11248), a compound that simultaneously targets
several RTKs, including VEGFR, PDGFR, Kit, and
FMS-like TK3 (FLT3), received approval for the treatment of advanced RCC after the confirmation of an

improvement in PFS among patients with low- and
intermediate-risk features (Motzer criteria) in a phase
3 study.87 Sorafenib (BAY43-9006), another multikinase inhibitor, was approved based on the clinical
activity demonstrated in a phase 3 study in the treatment for RCC patients with low- and intermediaterisk features who received previous biologic therapy.88 It also was approved recently for the treatment
of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.235 Although it was developed originally as an
inhibitor of the RAF serine/threonine kinases (RAF-1,
wild-type BRAF, V600E BRAF mutant), subsequent
studies revealed that it also inhibits VEGFR, PDGFR,
Kit, and FLT3,89 which currently is believed to be the
main mechanism by which sorafenib exerts its antitumor activity. It is also a potent inhibitor of the oncogenic RET kinase, and further studies may enlarge
its repertoire of tumor activity to include RET-positive medullary thyroid tumors. Despite similarity in
drug targets between sorafenib and sunitinib, the
higher tumor response rate observed with sunitinib
is attributed to its stronger binding affinity to the
involved kinases compared with sorafenib.90 Moreover, sunitinib prolonged survival compared with
placebo among patients with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).91
A Combination of EGFR and VEGFR blockade
has been investigated with variable results. Erlotinib
does not improve the efficacy of bevacizumab in
RCC,92 whereas the combination produced encouraging results in NSCLC.93 Whether TKIs with activity
against both targets, such as ZD6474 (EGFR, VEGFR,
RET) and AEE788 (EGFR, HER-2, VEGFR2, c-Src) will
exhibit a similar spectrum of clinical utility currently
is being investigated.
Originally developed as a sedative, thalidomide
had a tainted history in pharmacotherapy because of
unexpected teratogenicity that arose from its use in
pregnant women. Now, it is experiencing a ‘renaissance,’ because its antiangiogenic effect has been
recognized as a valid platform for cancer therapy.
Thalidomide down-regulates the expression of VEGF
and basic fibroblast growth factor apart from suppressing the production of tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a) and modulating cytokine responses.94-96
However, its clinical benefit is limited by cumulative
and dose-dependent toxicities of neuropathy, fatigue,
constipation, and sedation that often preclude prolonged administration. Lenalidomide is an orally
bioavailable thalidomide analog with 100-fold to
1000-fold greater potency than its parent compound
in promoting T-cell activation, inhibiting neoangiogenesis, and suppressing the production of TNF-a
and other inflammatory cytokines. It lacks the seda-

Novel Systemic Cancer Therapies/Dy and Adjei

tive properties of thalidomide but exhibits more
myelosuppression. Lenalidomide has remarkable activity in the subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS) with an interstitial deletion of chromosome
5q.97 Its karyotype-dependent mechanism of action
is supported by correlative biomarker studies, in
which direct cytotoxicity predominates in del(5q)
MDS, whereas proliferation arrest is observed predominantly in lenalidomide-induced responses in nondel(5q) MDS.98

Class III RTKs: PDGFR/c-kit/FLT3-mediated pathways
The Class III RTKs, such as PDGFR, c-kit, and FLT3,
are characterized by the presence of 5 Ig-like
domains in the extracellular region and by the
separation of the catalytic TK domain in 2 parts by
the insertion of a specific hydrophilic ‘interkinase’
sequence of variable length. The split TK feature
separates this class from other RTKs, a notable characteristic that is shared by VEGFRs. Therefore, it was
not surprising to find eventually that ATP mimetics
that initially were designed to inhibit PDGFR also
inhibited c-kit and FLT3 activity and, with more versatile multitargeted TKIs, inhibited the activity of
VEGFR as well.
Stem cell factor (SCF) (also called steel factor or
mast cell growth factor) is the ligand of the c-Kit TK
receptor that is expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells, normal mature mast cells, Cajal cells, melanocytes, and germ cells. Receptor dimerization
activates multiple downstream substrate proteins,
such as PI3K and src family kinases.99
Gain-of-function mutations of c-kit occur in several human neoplasms, including mastocytosis
(>90%), GISTs (90%), sinonasal T-cell lymphomas
(17%), seminomas/dysgerminomas (9%), and acute
myelogenous leukemia (1%).100 There is an apparent
association between the type of c-kit mutation and
specific disease groups. In the majority of adult systemic mastocytosis, the most frequent mutation in
the activation loop is D816V, whereas GISTs typically
are negative for D816V and commonly exhibit activating mutations at the regulatory juxtamembrane
region in exon 11 instead.101 The PDGFR/PDGF system includes 2 receptors (PDGFRa and PDGFRb) and
4 ligands (PDGF-A, PDGF-B, PDGF-C, and PDGF-D).
It is involved in angiogenesis and in the regulation of
vascular permeability and interstitial fluid pressure.
It can become active constitutively in a variety of
ways. Cytogenetic abnormalities arising from reciprocal translocations or interstitial deletions in hematopoietic malignancies give rise to activated PDGFR
fusion proteins.102 Moreover, gain-of-function mutations occur in positions analogous to those observed

1871

with c-kit in patients with GISTs. Although they are
mutually exclusive, oncogenic mutations in PDGFRA
and c-KIT result in the activation of common signaling pathways. FLT3 expression in the hematopoietic
system, conversely, is restricted to CD34-positive
stem/progenitor cells. FLT3 mutations are the most
frequent genetic alteration reported in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) to date. Internal tandem duplication
(FLT3/ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain-coding
sequence and mutations of D835 within the activation loop of the kinase domain are the most common causes of constitutive activation of FLT3
encountered among patients with AML.103,104 Imatinib is an inhibitor of several TKs that include c-KIT
and PDGFR. It is effective in gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (GIST) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and is the treatment of choice for patients with
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) harboring the activating translocations involving the PDGFb
receptor locus on chromosome 5q33.105 Conversely,
structural changes induced by the D816V mutation
prevents imatinib binding and limits the use of imatinib in mastocytosis to cases in which the D816V
mutation is absent or FIP1L1/PDGFRA gene rearrangements are present.

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated
antigen 4-mediated pathway
Intratumoral T cells may modify tumor stroma or tumor cells in ways that modulate the metastatic
potential of tumor cells. For example, the type, density, and location of immune cells within tumor samples were identified as better predictors of patient
survival than the histopathologic methods currently
used to stage CRC.106 Over the past decade, cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte (CTL)–associated antigen 4 (CTLA4)
has been established as a critical element in the
homeostatic mechanism of immunosuppression and
T-cell regulation. It is a transmembrane protein
expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes and
monocytes. For weak antigens, such as tumor-associated antigens, the activation of antigen-specific Tcell responses through interaction with T-cell receptors relies on nonantigen-specific signals generated
when CD28 on the T-cell binds to B7 on antigen-presenting cells. Once this occurs, CTLA4 subsequently
becomes expressed on the T-cell surface within 2 or
3 days of T-cell activation.107
CTLA4 exhibits a higher binding affinity to B7,
out competing its prior interaction with CD28, thus
abrogating the immune response,108 including
decreased interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor
expression.109 Treatment leading to decreased CTLA4
expression in patients with melanoma also was cor-

related with improved outcomes.110 CTLA4 blockade
also has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in murine
models of prostate cancer, colon cancer, fibrosarcoma, and melanoma.111
Trelimumab, a fully human IgG2 MoAb, and ipilimumab, a fully human IgG1 MoAb, are 2 of the
CTLA4-blocking agents that are in advanced stages
of clinical development. Both bind to the CTLA-4
molecule, resulting in the inhibition of B7-CTLA4–
mediated down-regulation of T-cell activation. Promising results in melanoma patients in early clinical
trials have led to the design of ongoing phase 3 clinical trials to confirm the role of CTLA4 blockade in
the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Phase 2 trials
in patients with prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer,
and colon cancer also are ongoing.

Intracellular Signaling Interface
Ras pathway
The RAS gene superfamily encodes guanosine triphosphate hydrolases (GTPases), which transduce
signals that regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival.112 Activating Ras mutations are observed in approximately 30% of human
cancers. Farnesyl transferase (FT) inhibitors (FTIs)
were developed ostensibly to block the posttranslation modification of Ras, an essential step for membrane anchorage to allow the initiation of
downstream target activation (for targets such as Raf,
mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, and extracellular
signal-regulated kinases). Aside from Ras, posttranslation farnesylation is necessary for the activation of
numerous regulatory proteins, such as rho, lamin,
centromere-associated protein, protein tyrosine
phosphatases.113 The finding that FTIs exert antitumor activity regardless of ras mutation status and
retention of ras oncogenic function attests to the
relevance of proteins other than Ras in mediating
FTI-induced inhibition of angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and survival.114 In addition, FTIs can rapidly
trigger the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) independent of its effect on FT. The genotoxic
stress arising from ROS initiates various DNAdamage responses that lead to apoptosis.115 Tipifarnib and lonafarnib are the most widely studied FTIs.
However, with several negative phase 3 studies, the
development of these agents has been discontinued.116,117 Currently, it is unclear when second-generation agents will become available for testing.
Abl pathway
Imatinib, as discussed above, exhibits plurality in its
effects. The targets of its inhibition include the nonreceptor TK abl, which, in oncogenic form as a

fusion protein with bcr in CML, constituted its first
validation as a targeted therapy. However, primary
and secondary resistance to imatinib is common. To
address this, second-generation bcr/abl drugs have
been developed, such as dasatinib and nilotinib.
Nilotinib exhibits increased affinity for wild-type bcrabl by 20- to 30-fold compared with imatinib while
retaining similar activity against PDGFR and c-kit.118
Dasatinib, conversely, binds to its targets with greater
affinity than either imatinib or nilotinib, making it
300-fold more potent than imatinib against abl kinase and 20-fold more potent against wild-type ckit.119 Unlike imatinib, dasatinib is not a substrate of
multidrug
P-glycoprotein
efflux
pump.120,121
Both nilotinib and dasatinib have demonstrated impressive clinical activity in dose-escalation phase 1
studies involving patients with imatinib-resistant
CML.122,123 Unlike nilotinib, dasatinib has dual specificity for both abl and src family kinases and remains
effective in both imatinib-resistant and nilotinib-resistant CML, eg, CML arising from the overexpression
of src family kinases (eg, LYN).124 In contrast, complete response rates with both agents were <10% in
patients with systemic mastocytosis despite promising preclinical data.125,126

Proteasome pathway
The systematic regulation of protein synthesis and
degradation is essential for normal cellular function.
For example, the Cbl E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitylates
active EGF receptors and other RTKs, which results
in down-regulation of these transmembrane receptors as they are targeted for endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. The loss of Cbl binding observed in
several oncogenic variants of EGFR, c-Met, and c-Kit
leads to their accumulation at the plasma membrane
and sustained signaling.127
The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediates
protein degradation in a stepwise fashion. Proteins
become tagged with ubiquitin polypeptides during
ubiquitination, which targets them for degradation
by the multienzyme proteolytic complex 26S proteasome. in an ATP-dependent manner.128 The substrates for proteasomal degradation include proteins
that mediate various cellular functions, such as transcription, stress response, cell cycle regulation, oncogenesis, ribosome biogenesis, cellular differentiation,
angiogenesis, and DNA repair, which are dysregulated in neoplastic cells.128 The differential increased
susceptibility of malignant cells to proteasome inhibition compared with normal cells purportedly arises
from a greater reliance of malignant cells on proteasomal degradation of a higher proportion of
mutated, misfolded proteins, which threaten cell via-

Novel Systemic Cancer Therapies/Dy and Adjei

bility. Results of preclinical and clinical studies of
proteasome inhibitors indicate that their antitumor
effects are associated with increased expression of
several
cell-cycle–regulatory/inhibitory
proteins
(such as p27/ KIP1 and p21/WAF1), caspase activation, and blockade of the nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)
proliferative pathway, which overcomes bcl-2mediated resistance to apoptosis and results in the
reversal of chemoresistance and radioresistence and
the inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis.129
The 26S proteasome contains proteolytic core
20S and 19S regulatory subunits. Bortezomib, a
dipeptide boronate, potently binds to a single threonine in the chymotrypsin-like site of the 20S proteasome and dissociates slowly, reversibly inhibiting the
proteasome.130 Recent studies demonstrated that
selective inactivation of the chymotrypsin-like site is
inadequate, inhibiting protein breakdown by only
10% to 30%.131 Newer inhibitors are being developed
to inhibit both the caspase-like and tyrpsin-like proteolytic activities of the proteasome that may be
effective in cells resistant to bortezomib.132 Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor to enter clinical
development and is approved for the treatment of
multiple myeloma. It also has demonstrated remarkable clinical activity in mantle cell lymphoma,
another disease entity in which cyclin D1 is overexpressed. Ongoing studies are investigating bortezomib in combination with chemoradiation in lung
cancer with cytotoxic chemotherapy as well as targeted therapy, such as erlotinib.

PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway
The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway is one of the best characterized pathways mediating oncogenic signaling
inputs from various sources, such as receptor TKs
(RTKs). Constitutive activation is demonstrated in
malignancies, such as small cell lung cancer, resulting in cell proliferation, cell survival, and chemoresistance. Development of PI3K inhibitors and Akt
inhibitors for clinical use has lagged behind that of
mTOR inhibitors, which found their initial pharmacologic niche in transplantation medicine. Although
immunosuppressive drug therapy using calcineurin
inhibitors has been implicated in the increased incidence of and deaths from malignancies in solid
organ transplantation recipients, maintenance
immunosuppression with mTOR inhibitors (eg,
sirolimus and everolimus) was associated with a significantly reduced risk of developing post-transplantation malignancies.133 This finding, coupled
with preclinical rationale, spurred the development of
mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of malignancies.

1873

mTOR, also referred to as sirolimus effector
protein, FK506-binding protein (FKBP12)-rapamycin–associated protein, rapamycin and FKBP12 target, rapamycin-associated protein, or rapamycin
target, is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase
that acts as the ‘hub’ to relay signals coming in
from 2 major pathways. mTOR is activated by PI3K/
Akt through growth factor stimulation, whereas it is
inhibited by the serine/threonine kinase 11 (LKB1)/
AMP-activated kinase pathway in response to nutrient status (ie, amino acids, ATP levels).134 mTOR
exists in 2 complexes: the raptor-mTOR complex
(mTORC1) is rapamycin sensitive, and the rictormTOR complex (MTORC2) is rapamycin resistant.135 This is important to remember, because the
mTOR2 complex is responsible for the full activation of Akt135 and may be responsible in part for
mTOR resistance. Indeed, rapamycin-induced feedback activation of Akt has been demonstrated preclinically.136,137 Nonetheless, because activation of
mTOR releases translational repression and promotes mRNA translation and protein synthesis, inhibition of mTORC1 reduces the levels of oncogenic
proteins, such as c-Myc, hyopxia-inducible factor
1a (HIFa), VEGF, and cyclin D1.138 Moreover, prolonged treatment with rapamycin can potentially
inactivate mTORC2 in some cases.139
Temsirolimus (cell cycle inhibitor 779) is the
third drug to receive approval from the FDA, after
sunitinib and sorafenib, for the treatment of RCC.
This approval was based on results from a large
phase 3 trial in patients with previously untreated,
poor-prognosis, metastatic RCC. Those results demonstrated that temsirolimus alone improved OS
compared with interferon a (IFN-a).140 The addition
of temsirolimus to IFN did not improve survival
compared with IFN alone, and the authors attributed
that result to the increased toxicities arising from the
combination therapy. Several features of this drug
are noteworthy. Unlike sunitinib and sorafenib,
which block VEGFR, representing the distal/receptor
arm of the angiogenesis-promoting VHL/hypoxiaHIF axis, temsirolimus inhibits the VHL/HIF axis
proximally by decreasing HIFa and VEGF levels
through mTOR kinase inhibition.141 This is interesting, because the majority of RCCs are the clear cell
type, which characteristically is associated with loss
of function of the VHL gene and the up-regulation of
HIF1/2a, leading to VEGF overproduction.142 It is
also the only targeted agent to date that has demonstrated a statistically significant, albeit modest
improvement in OS in poor-risk patients. It has
demonstrated promising activity in patients with
mantle cell lymphoma and sarcomas.

Transcriptional regulation pathways
Epigenetic pathway. Epigenetic changes refer to heritable changes in gene expression that do not arise
from mutations or polymorphisms in the nucleotide
sequence. The best described epigenetic changes
refer to promoter region CpG dinucleotide hypermetylation and histone deacetylation, both of which
result in transcription repression. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) catalyze the transfer of a methyl
group to the cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides,
which tend to cluster in promoter regions of genes.
DNMT1 is the most abundant and important in
maintaining methylation of the CpG islands that
result in transcriptional silencing of gene expression,
tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair genes in
malignancies.143 5-Azacitidine and 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (decitabine) are demethylating agents that originally were developed as cell-cycle, S-phase–specific
nucleoside analogues and were administered in high
doses as classic cytotoxic agents for the treatment of
myeloid malignancies. Further investigation revealed
that, even at low concentrations, when these agents
are incorporated into DNA, they covalently bind and
trap DNMT enzymes, depleting the intact enzymes
and causing passive demethylation.144 Hypomethylation of p15 is a representative event that often occurs
after treatment with these demethylating agents, and
consequent increased expression appears to correlate
with clinical response in patients with MDS,
although this is not a consistent finding.145 Both
agents are approved for the treatment of MDS. Other
mechanisms of action include restoration of the
expression of major histocompatibility Class I molecules and cancer testis antigens on tumor cells, rendering the tumor cells susceptible to CTL attack.146
Moreover, demethylation and re-expression of the tumor-suppressor gene that encodes death-associated
protein kinase can restore the IFNg-mediated apoptotic cell-death pathway in leukemia cells.147 Both
agents require prolonged intravenous or subcutaneous administration; thus, research to develop oral
DNMT inhibitors continues.
DNA methylation alone is insufficient to repress
transcription. Acetylation and deacetylation of histones further regulate transcription events in eukaryotic cells, with acetylation promoting transcriptional
activation because of relaxation of the chromatin
structure. Histone acetyltransferases add acetyl
groups, whereas HDACs remove acetyl groups from
lysine residues.148 Classified into 4 major classes,
there are multiple isoforms of HDACs, and 18 have
been identified in humans to date that are not
redundant in function.149 Class I and II HDACs share
conserved catalytic residues, and it has been demon-

strated that they are overexpressed and mutated in
cancer. Class III HDACs differ from Class I and II
HDACs in their catalytic site and are not inhibited
by compounds like trichostatin A or vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or SAHA).150 HDAC
inhibitors act as transcriptional repressors by promoting chromatin condensation, altering a relatively
small proportion of expressed genes (2-10%) in
transformed cells. This paradoxically represses as
many genes as are induced.150 The cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 are among the more
common genes induced by HDAC inhibition, which
results in cell cycle G1 and G2 arrests. Moreover,
because HDACs have multiple nonhistone substrates, such as hormone receptors, chaperone proteins, signal-transduction mediators, cytoskeletal
proteins, etc, inhibition of HDACs also can alter cellular
processes
by
transcription-independent
mechanisms.149 All of these actions can lead to cell
differentiation, apoptosis and growth arrest. Inhibition of angiogenesis also occurs by reduced expression of HIF-1 and VEGF.151
Cell death induced by HDAC inhibitors, by both
intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways and by
autophagy, occurs preferentially in transformed cells,
because normal cells are relatively resistant to HDAC
inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity.152-154 Vorinostat is a
pan-HDAC inhibitor and is approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). It is
currently undergoing phase 3 evaluation for treatment of mesothelioma. Clinical development of this
class of drugs emphasize combinatorial strategies
with both cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents as well
as other novel anticancer agents to circumvent
mechanism of resistance, such as demethylating
agents, inhibitors of NF-kB, and the bcl-2 antiapoptotic pathway.155
Retinoid pathway. Retinoids modulate gene expression by activating nuclear retinoic acid receptors
(RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which are
transcription factors that act predominantly as RARRXR heterodimers affecting cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.156 In the absence of ligands,
RAR-RXR heterodimers form multiprotein complexes
with transcriptional corepressors, such as HDACs, to
silence gene expression.157 All-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA), an RAR-specific ligand, constitutes the backbone of therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL), which is characterized by the promyelocytic
leukemia (PML)-RAR-a fusion gene resulting from
the chromosomal translocation t(15;17). The oncogenic activity of the fusion protein arises from the
disruption of PML function as transcription coactivator of the tumor suppressor p53. Moreover, PML-

Novel Systemic Cancer Therapies/Dy and Adjei

RAR-a exhibits a higher affinity for HDACs, which
then ‘superrepresses’ RAR-a signaling, thus suppressing the ability of myelopoietic cells to differentiate
into mature neutrophils.158
Bexarotene, a synthetic retinoid analogue,
belongs to a class of drug known as rexinoids that
specifically activates RXRs and has a lower affinity
for the RARs. It is an oral noncytotoxic drug and is
the first of its class to be approved for the treatment
of refractory CTCL. It has been demonstrated that
bexarotine induces apoptosis in various types of malignant cells through caspase-3 activation in association with the down-regulation of RXR-a and RARa.159 However, it failed to improve OS in 2 phase 3
trials when it was combined with first-line chemotherapy administered for advanced NSCLC.160,161

Apoptotic Pathways
The prevalent dogma indicates that inactivation of
apoptosis, 1 of various modes of cellular death that
may occur with chemotherapy, is central not only to
the development of cancer but also to treatment resistance.162 The 2 main pathways of apoptosis, the
intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, analogous to the
convergence on a common pathway observed with
the dichotomous complement and coagulation cascades, ultimately result in the activation of effector
caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, to execute
the programmed cell death. The extrinsic pathway is
triggered by the ligation of receptors of the TNF
superfamily that contain functional cytoplasmic
death domains (DD), such as Fas/apoptosis inducing
ligand-like protein 1 (Apo1), death receptor 4 (DR4)/
TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand-like receptor
1 (TRAILR1)/Apo2, and DR5/TRAILR2, by specific
ligands. The intrinsic pathway is mediated by mitochondria with the release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins, such as cytochrome c, and is
regulated in part by the bcl-2 family of proapoptotic
and antiapoptotic proteins.
Arsenic trioxide (ATO) promotes caspase-dependent apoptosis, disruption of mitochondrial respiration, and depletion of cellular organic thiols. ATO
can induce dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in
activated endothelial cells and can inhibit VEGF production.163 In the Far East, arsenic was the mainstay
for the treatment of leukemia since the 1700s. In the
18th century, Thomas Fowler developed a potassium
bicarbonate-based solution of ATO called ‘Fowler solution’, a tonic that was prescribed for the treatment
of many diseases, including cancer, in the 18th and
19th centuries.164
When ATO was used in different types of leukemia, consistent responses occurred only in APL.

1875

ATO degrades this fusion protein in a proteolytic
pattern different from that of ATRA, thus negating
the suppressive effect of the PML-RAR-a protein.165,166 At low concentrations (0.1-0.5 mM), ATO
induces differentiation of malignant promyelocytes
through inactivation of the PML-RARa fusion protein; whereas, at high concentrations (0.5-2 mM), it
triggers apoptosis of the promyelocytes and other
cancer cells.167 It is important to understand that
PML-RAR-a is not required for the apoptotic
response of APL cells to ATO.168 Induction of apoptosis is related to the generation and accumulation
of high intracellular levels of ROS,169 which affect
sulfhydryl-rich proteins, including enzymes that catalyze protein tyrosine phosphorylation and other
proteins crucial in cytokine-mediated signal-transduction pathways.170,171
Antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, often are overexpressed
in many human cancers and contribute to tumor development and treatment resistance. G3139 (oblimersen), or Genasense, is an 18-base antisense
phosphorothioate oligonucleotide complementary to
the bcl-2 mRNA. Its binding to the cognate sequence
of bcl-2 mRNA results in inhibition of mRNA translation and RNase H-mediated mRNA degradation.172
Oblimersen down-regulated bcl-2 protein in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and demonstrated preclinical evidence of activity in CLL. A
randomized, multicenter, phase 3 study comparing
chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with or without oblimersen among patients
with relapsed or refractory CLL demonstrated superior survival in the subset of patients who achieved
an objective tumor response from therapy, although
there was no significant difference in the TTP or OS
in the by intention-to-treat analysis.173,174 These
results were deemed insufficient for drug approval by
the FDA.
Similarly tantalizing, results from a phase 3
trial of dacarbazine alone or in combination with
oblimersen in 771 patients with advanced malignant melanoma, although it did not achieve a statistical difference in the primary endpoint of OS,
demonstrated a significant increase in PFS (2.6
months vs 1.6 months; P < .001) and objective
response rates (13.5% vs 7.5%; P 5 .007) favoring
the treatment arm that contained oblimersen.175
Retrospective analysis of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at study entry suggested that the
benefit from oblimersen was limited to patients
with normal serum LDH levels. This spurred the
implementation of an ongoing phase 3 randomized
trial of dacarbazine with or without oblimersen in

1876

chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced melanoma and low-normal LDH levels (the AGENDA
trial). A potential criticism against that study, in
which future results turned out to be nonsignificant, was the lack of patient selection, which limited inclusion to patients with tumors that
overexpressed bcl-2.
Oral small molecule inhibitors of BCL-2 modeled after the naturally occurring bcl-2 inhibitor,
BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID), are in
early-phase clinical studies. These include AT-101
(gossypol), ABT-263, and ABT-737, which inhibit
both bcl-2 and related apoptotic inhibitors bcl-X
and bcl-W.

Toxicities
Although targeted therapies ideally should have a
better therapeutic index than conventional cytotoxic
chemotherapy because of the premise that the
selected targets are expressed differentially in tumor
cells compared with normal tissues, the finding that
the various signaling networks discussed above are
involved in the physiology and homeostasis of normal cells inevitably leads to mechanism-based class
effects. Nonspecific symptoms of fatigue and gastrointestinal complaints are common. Oncologists, thus,
ear encountering more complex issues related not
only to drug-induced morbidities and mortalities but
also to quality of life and long-term maintenance
treatment using these agents.
Cardiovascular
Hypertension and proteinuria are now well established phenotypic manifestations attributable to endothelial dysfunction arising from manipulation of
the VEGF signaling pathway. A severe clinical presentation related to endothelial dysfunction in malignant hypertension is posterior reversible
encephalopathy syndrome or PRES, which has been
reported with bevacizumab176,177 and with small
molecule inhibitors, such as vatalanib.178 Moreover,
because normal functions of the endothelium
encompass both anticoagulant and procoagulant
activities critical for physiologic maintenance of
normal hemostasis and VEGF has direct hemostatic
effects on the endothelial cells, both thrombotic
events (eg, deep vein thormobosin) and hemorrhagic events (eg, epistaxis) are increased with antiVEGF therapy, as demonstrated in the early bevacizumab trials in CRC and lung cancer and in the
thalidomide/lenalidomide trials in multiple myeloma. Syncopal episodes arising from bradyarrhythmias are unique to thalidomide because of its
vagolytic effect.179

Heart rate corrected QT (QTc) interval prolongation is recognized increasingly as a potential sequelae with any pharmacologic agent. The most
common side effects of ATO in patients with APL are
electrocardiograph changes, especially a delayed cardiac repolarization manifested by prolongation of the
QT interval and the QTc interval.180 In patients
receiving HDACs and drugs with EGFR-inhibitory activity, dose-related QTc prolongation has been documented. QTc prolongation also was observed in
patients who received an early-generation FTI, L778,123.181 Although they mostly have been asymptomatic and without clinical sequelae, fatal arrhythmias have been reported.182 The mechanism for this
toxicity is unknown, although drug interactions with
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors taken by some
of these patients cannot be excluded. Other forms of
cardiotoxicity have been reported with other agents,
such as sunitinib, in which left ventricular dysfunction is described in 11% to 15% of patients treated,
and imatinib, in which a murine model demonstrated that c-abl inhibition mediated the toxic cardiomyopathy that this drug induced.183 Fluid
retention resulting in pleural effusions or peripheral
edema are observed with dasatinib and imatinib
therapy. It is believed that the this is caused by inhibition of the TKs responsible for capillary integrity,
such as PDGFR-b, a receptor expressed in pericytes
that regulate vascular permeability and interstitial
fluid pressure.184
The best-established model of drug-induced
cardiomyopathy associated with novel therapies is
that induced by long-term trastuzumab. The manifestations are similar to the congestive heart failure
observed with anthracycline therapy. A retrospective analysis of data collected from over 1000
women who participated in phase 2 and 3 trastuzumab trials indicated that the incidence of Class III
or IV cardiac dysfunction was 2% for patients who
were receiving first-line trastuzumab, 4% for
patients who were receiving trastuzumab in the refractory setting, 2% for patients who were receiving
concurrent paclitaxel plus trastuzumab, 1% for
patients who were receiving paclitaxel alone, 16%
for patients who were receiving concurrent doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) plus trastuzumab, and 4% for patients who were receiving AC
alone.185 Prior or concomitant therapy with an
anthracycline, age, and underlying cardiac disease
were independent risk factors.

Immunologic
Many of the novel therapies selectively target the
cells involved in immune system regulation. Target-

Novel Systemic Cancer Therapies/Dy and Adjei

ing CTLA4 is rational, because CTLA4-expressing regulatory T cells restrain the immune system from
attacking cancer cells. Conversely, because it serves a
crucial role in immune tolerance, thereby dampening
the immune response in general, the expected consequence of CTLA4 blockade is treatment-induced
autoimmunity manifested in diverse fashion that
includes enterocolitis, dermatitis, hypophysitis, uveitis, hepatitis.186-188 On the basis of preclinical testing,
a way to reduce such autoimmune response is by the
administration of a vaccine together with anti-CTLA4
therapy to direct immune responses toward target
antigens. This strategy currently is being explored in
clinical trials.
On the opposite extreme, an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-like immunodeficiency state
maybe induced by the administration of alemtuzumab, which causes a profound and long-lasting
depletion of mature B- and T-lymphocytes, natural
killer cells, and monocytes.189 This abnormality
may persist for >1 year; thus, routine prophylaxis
against important bacterial, viral, and fungal infections are included in the treatment of patients
receiving alemtuzumab.190 Similarly, T-cell function
may be affected by TKIs. Murine models also reveal
that imatinib selectively impair the expansion of
memory CTLs.191 Dasatinib as well as high doses of
imatinib suppresses T-cell proliferation and activation, presumably through inhibition of the lymphocyte-specific protein TK LCK.192,193 These effects
are context-dependent (eg, local drug concentration, duration of drug exposure), because immunostimulatory natural killer-cell activation194,195 has
been observed in vivo and is believed to mediate
the antitumor effects in patients with GISTs who
have no KIT or PDGFRA mutation and who still
respond to imatinib mesylate. It has been demonstrated that retinoids such as ATRA enhance IFN-g
and IL-12 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells, induce cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and
stimulate natural killer activity in vivo.196,197
A reminder that there potentially could be serious, unanticipated toxicity from these ‘targeted’
agents is the recent events surrounding the development of immunomodulatory drugs. TGN1412, a
humanized MoAb that binds to the CD28 receptor of
T cells, possessed superagonistic properties to fully
activate T cells without the need for additional antigen-receptor stimulation. In a highly sensationalized
phase 1 trial involving healthy volunteers, 4 of 6
patients who received the drug suffered multiorgan
failure arising from severe hypersensitivity reaction.198 This triggered the temporary suspension of

1877

clinical trials involving immunomodulatory drugs in
the UK in early 2006.
A cloud also was cast over the development of
natalizumab, a recombinant MoAb against a4 integrins used in multiple sclerosis, which was withdrawn
from the market after several reports of progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The risk of developing this complication was estimated at 1 in 1000
patients who received treatment for an average of 18
months.199 It is hypothesized that blockade of integrin function is restricted immune cell migration that
otherwise would have restricted the reactivation of
dormant JC polyomavirus. Whether other drugs that
target integrins will encounter a similar toxicity is yet
to be demonstrated.

Metabolic
Metabolic derangements mimicking the lipid and
glucose abnormalities observed with insulin resistance in diabetic patients are not unexpected with
agents affecting the insulin-like growth factor/Akt/
mTOR pathway. Hyperlipidemia, and severe hypertriglyceridemia in particular, has been associated with
drug-induced pancreatitis. Hyperlipidemia (hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia) also is a well
known complication of retinoid and rexinoid therapy.
It is believed that this process is mediated by
increased plasma apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III)
concentrations as a consequence of induction of hepatic apoC-III gene expression at the transcriptional
level through an RXR-mediated mechanism.200 Reversible central hypothyroidism with profound suppression of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone
levels also is a well documented and anticipated
adverse event of rexinoids that is mediated primarily
through RXR.201 Hypothyroidism itself can contribute
to the mechanistic explanation for the hyperlipidemia observed with this class of drug. In contrast,
subclinical primary hypothyroidism is the form
observed in a small proportion of patients who
receive agents with antiangiogenic properties, specifically sunitinib, thalidomide, lenalidomide, and cediranib.
Asymptomatic hyperamylasemia, hyperlipasemia,
and hypophosphatemia have been observed in 30%
to 45% of patients treated with sorafenib. Conversely,
severe hypomagnesemia in 10% to 15% of patients
has been reported with cetuximab.202 It has been
postulated that interference with proteins involved in
the active transport of magnesium in the nephron is
a possible mechanism.202 However, this toxicity is
not observed with EGFR TKI therapy; thus, the true
explanation is unclear.

Pulmonary
Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) can be
progressive and fatal and, although it is rare, has
been attributed causally to several novel therapies.
Reversible ILD has been reported with mTOR inhibitors and imatinib therapy. Gefitinib induces ILD
changes that mimic the changes induced by conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy.203 Although EGF signaling most likely represents a potential mechanism
of protection from lung injury by maintaining barrier
integrity,204 it is possible that EGFR inhibition may
impair the ability of pneumocytes to respond to lung
injury. Pharmacogenetic markers of susceptibility
may account for the higher incidence rates noted in
East Asian patients, and particularly in Japanese
patients, compared with the incidence rates among
patients who were treated in North America. The
apparently disproportionately increased risk of ILD
among Japanese patients also was observed with
leflunomide205 and bortezomib therapy.206 Among
patients with NSCLC who receive bevacizumab, lifethreatening hemoptysis may occur. This has been
correlated with the presence of a cavitating central
lesion or squamous histology, although the latter
most likely is a confounding variable because of its
frequent occurrence in central airways.
Hematologic
Prolonged circulation time of radioimmunoconjugated MoAbs results in radiation exposure of normal
organs and tissues, particularly tissue retention in
the reticuloendothelial system and kidneys. Consequently, myelosuppression is a well known toxicity,
especially among patients with hematologic disorders, either because of direct bone marrow involvement or because of prior extensive exposure to
myelotoxic therapies.207 Although lower molecular
weight fragments reduce bone marrow exposure
because of faster blood clearance, reduction in tumor
uptake is a trade-off.
Dose-dependent myelosuppression may be
observed with many targeted agents, such as FTIs,
abl/src kinase inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, sunitinib,
bortezomib, and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs)
(lenalidomide more than thalidomide). Severe neutropenia is observed with gemtuzumab, an expected
sequelae of its lineage-specific mechanism of targeting myeloid cells. Cylic thrombocytopenia is a frequent complication from treatment with bortezomib
and is more pronounced among patients with hematologic disorders, because of either bone marrow
involvement or extensive prior chemotherapies.208
Thrombocytopenia is transient and usually decreases
approximately 60% regardless of baseline parameters

during the first 10 days of each cycle, recovering toward baseline during the rest period between
cycles.209 It is believed that this arises from reversible
inhibition of platelet budding from megakaryocytes
that, in turn, is a tightly regulated process, which
depends in part on the activity of NF-kB, a target of
proteasome inhibition.210

Neurologic
Painful length-dependent sensorimotor peripheral
neuropathy caused by axonal damage and selective
loss of large-diameter myelinated fibers may be
observed with thalidomide.211 This usually occurs after prolonged administration of thalidomide, and the
risk increases with cumulative doses exceeding 50 g,
thus affecting up to 70% of patients who are treated
for >6 months.212 Similar to other toxic neuropathies, this may improve but not completely resolve
with drug cessation. Serial electrophysiologic studies
to monitor sensory nerve action potential amplitudes
and/or somatosensory evoked potential latencies
have been advocated as sensitive tests to gauge the
severity of neuropathy; however, there is insufficient
evidence to suggest that these are useful for early
detection.213 A pharmacogenetic explanation for susceptibility to neurotoxicity from thalidomide may be
provided by the acetylator status of an individual
patient, with the ‘slow acetylators’ at increased risk
for neuropathy because of slower excretion of the
drug.214 The incidence of neuropathy with lenalidomide, in contrast, is reduced markedly (<10%).
Similar to thalidomide, bortezomib also causes a
length-dependent, axonal, small- and large-fiber
polyneuropathy that predominantly is sensory in nature in approximately 33% of treated patients.215
Other drugs that induce sensory neuropathy,
although at a lower frequency, include sorafenib, the
FTI tipifarnib, and vandetanib. A shared attribute
among these drugs is their potential antiangiogenic
property, which may provide a mechanistic explanation for the neuropathy induced. Indeed, currently, it
is believed that the neuropathic effect of antitumor
drugs occurs through damage to vasa nervorum endothelial cells, in part through a VEGF-mediated
mechanism.216 This is plausible, because the role of
VEGF-dependent neuroprotection has been implicated previously in various neurodegenerative disorders.217 Loss of VEGF-mediated neuroprotection also
may explain in part the increased incidence of neuropathy reported with the combination of bevacizumab with either oxaliplatin79 or paclitaxel,218
although this commonly is ascribed to the longer duration of therapy that patients received because of

Novel Systemic Cancer Therapies/Dy and Adjei

delayed disease progression compared with the treatment regimens without bevacizumab.

Others
Certain dermatologic manifestations, such as hair
and/or skin depigmentation (sunitinib, sorafenib,
lapatinib, imatinib), are related to c-kit or PDGFRb
effects based on observations in murine models of
pigmentation disorders.219-221 Hand-foot skin reactions in up to 33% of patients who received sorafenib
(fewer patients with sunitinib) also have been
described, although the underlying mechanism is
poorly understood. Subungual splinter hemorrhages
that occur with these drugs are asymptomatic and
idiopathic in nature. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and
toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in
conjunction with thalidomide therapy, although
these are rare, because the most common dermatologic toxicity associated with IMiDs is a pruritic truncal and appendicular maculopapular rash. Skin
eruptions caused by EGFR-directed therapies are
characterized by interfollicular and intrafollicular
papulopustules and usually are evident during the
first 2 weeks of treatment. Polymorphic variations in
the target, such as the CA repeats in intron 1 of the
HER1/EGFR gene, may underlie the susceptibility to
develop rash and tumor response.222
Diarrhea may occur in tandem with skin rash as
part of the mucocutaneous toxicity experienced by
patients receiving sorafenib, FTI, or EGFR-related
therapy and also can occur independent of skin toxicities, such as with bortezomib therapy. Although
mucositis is observed rarely with treatment using signal-transduction agents, oral stomatitis (generally
mild) is commonplace among patients receiving
mTOR inhibitors. Whereas reversible elevation of
liver enzymes of various degrees may be observed in
most of the targeted agents, to date, veno-occlusive
disease has been associated uniquely with gemtuzumab.223 Bowel perforation and fistulae formation are
dreaded complications arising from anti-VEGF therapy, particularly with bevacizumab, predominantly in
patients with intra-abdominal/pelvic tumors such as
those encountered in clinical trials involving patients
with CRC, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer.
This is likely a function of multiple interdependent
conditions that impair mucosal healing, such as preexisting abnormalities in intestinal vasculature from
prior surgery, radiation and/or atherosclerotic disease, location of underlying disease, or typhlitis-like
manifestation of myelosuppression with combination
regimens. Although this complication arises infrequently (1.5% in patients with CRC), incidence has

1879

been reported as high as 11% in patients, particularly
among women with ovarian cancer.82,84,85,224

Conclusions
Over the last 60 years, the development of cancer
therapeutics has evolved from DNA/mitosis-directed
cytotoxic agents to targeting aberrant pathways, dysregulated signaling molecules, and tumor-specific
antigens. Although some successes have been
obtained, considerable refinement still is needed in
our approach. It has become clear that, because of
the redundancy in signaling pathways and survival
mechanisms, narrowly targeted agents are not as
effective as multitargeted agents, with the occasional
exceptions (as exemplified by CML or GIST) of dependence on a dominant aberrant signaling node for
which narrowly targeted agents can be successful.
Further research to ascertain determinants of drug
sensitivity conceptually would lead to a plethora of
anticancer agents with clinical use based on pathway-driven selection, akin to antibiotic therapy.
Moreover, the current research interest in combining
various ‘targeted’ agents recapitulates the leitmotif
with the use of traditional chemotherapy agents.
Advancing the field of systemic cancer therapy
requires sustained efforts in refining the molecular
classification and diagnosis of cancer to complement
traditional anatomic pathologic classification. We
envision dynamic decision algorithms for therapy in
the future based on molecular signatures unique to
each individual patient and his/her cancer. Nonetheless, therapeutic manipulation of various signaltransduction pathways will be at a stalemate despite
an extensive knowledge of the small-world network
of intracellular signals and the dynamics of target
activation and processing in the absence of concomitant improvement in drug design and delivery.
