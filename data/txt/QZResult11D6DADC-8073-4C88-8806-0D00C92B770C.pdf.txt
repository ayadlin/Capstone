Abstract
Abnormal cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, yet there is an absence of quantitative methods to
dynamically image this powerful cellular function. Optical metabolic imaging (OMI) is a noninvasive, highresolution, quantitative tool for monitoring cellular metabolism. OMI probes the ﬂuorescence intensities and
lifetimes of the autoﬂuorescent metabolic coenzymes reduced NADH and ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide. We
conﬁrm that OMI correlates with cellular glycolytic levels across a panel of human breast cell lines using standard
assays of cellular rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion (P < 0.05, r ¼ 0.89). In addition, OMI resolves
differences in the basal metabolic activity of untransformed from malignant breast cells (P < 0.05) and between
breast cancer subtypes (P < 0.05), deﬁned by estrogen receptor and/or HER2 expression or absence. In vivo OMI is
sensitive to metabolic changes induced by inhibition of HER2 with the antibody trastuzumab (herceptin) in
HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer xenografts in mice. This response was conﬁrmed with tumor growth
curves and stains for Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3. OMI resolved trastuzumab-induced changes in cellular
metabolism in vivo as early as 48 hours posttreatment (P < 0.05), whereas ﬂuorodeoxyglucose-positron emission
tomography did not resolve any changes with trastuzumab up to 12 days posttreatment (P > 0.05). In addition,
OMI resolved cellular subpopulations of differing response in vivo that are critical for investigating drug resistance
mechanisms. Importantly, OMI endpoints remained unchanged with trastuzumab treatment in trastuzumabresistant xenografts (P > 0.05). OMI has signiﬁcant implications for rapid cellular-level assessment of metabolic
response to molecular expression and drug action, which would greatly accelerate drug development studies.

Introduction
Cellular metabolism produces energy and macromolecules necessary for cell survival. Abnormal metabolism is
involved in many of the diseases that cause the greatest
burden of morbidity and mortality in the developed world.
Many malignant cancer cells maintain high rates of glycolysis in the presence of oxygen (1) and oncogenic transformation is linked with changes in metabolic rates. For
example, the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase, which is ampliﬁed in about 20% of invasive breast cancer, potently activates the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR
pathway, a master regulator of glucose metabolism (2, 3).

with more aggressive disease and generally have a poor
prognosis (4). HER2 inhibitors such as the antibody trastuzumab (herceptin) provide substantial clinical beneﬁts.
However, the action of HER2 inhibitors is limited because
of innate and acquired drug resistance (5).
Clinically and in preclinical drug development, there is a
need for high-resolution, noninvasive, functional imaging
tools to monitor and predict drug efﬁcacy versus lack of
efﬁcacy. In cancer research, the primary endpoint of drug
efﬁcacy is tumor regression. However, cellular and molecular
changes precede changes in tumor size. If these molecular
endpoints could be identiﬁed and measured, they would
provide biomarkers predictive of drug response or drug
resistance. Cellular metabolism is particularly sensitive to
upstream molecular interventions and therefore may be a
powerful biomarker of early-drug response. The HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab, for example, inhibits PI3K-mediated glucose metabolism (6–8). Current preclinical and clinical
methodologies to assess metabolic state in tumors in situ
include ﬂuorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography
(FDG-PET), immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment of
levels of metabolic regulators, and metabolic ﬂux analyses
(7, 9–13). Yet each of these techniques fails to capture
dynamic changes in metabolic state and poorly reﬂect
sensitivity to drug efﬁcacy (7, 9, 14–18).

Metabolic Imaging Identiﬁes Early Cancer Treatment Response

Optical metabolic imaging (OMI) exploits the autoﬂuorescent properties of reducedNADH and ﬂavin adenine
dinucleotide (FAD), two metabolic coenzymes. We use multiphoton ﬂuorescence and time-correlated single photon counting to measure the optical redox ratio and ﬂuorescence
lifetimes of NADH and FAD in living cells and tissues. The
optical redox ratio is the ratio of NADH ﬂuorescence intensity
divided by FAD ﬂuorescence intensity (19) and provides a
dynamic measure of cellular metabolism (8, 19–21). The ﬂuorescence lifetime, the time a molecule remains in the excited
state, is independent of inter- or intrainstrument variability,
resolves free and bound protein conﬁgurations, and is inﬂuenced by preferred protein-binding of the molecules and
proximity to quenchers (e.g., oxygen; ref. 22). NADH and
FAD each have two-component ﬂuorescence decays. For
NADH, the short lifetime (t 1) corresponds to NADH free in
solution, whereas the long lifetime (t 2) corresponds to proteinbound NADH (23). Conversely, protein-bound FAD corresponds to the short lifetime, whereas free FAD corresponds
with the long lifetime (24). The shorter ﬂuorescence lifetimes
of both protein-bound FAD and free NADH are due to dynamic quenching by the adenine moiety (22, 25). The mean
ﬂuorescence lifetime (t m) is the weighted average of the
short and long lifetime components, t m ¼ a1t 1 þ a2t2, where
a1 and a2 are the fractional contributions of the short and long
lifetimes, respectively.
The images acquired by OMI provide sufﬁcient resolution
and contrast to distinguish the cellular and extracellular
tissue compartments, as the collagen-enriched ECM generates
a strong second harmonic signal that has a lifetime and
spectral emission distinct from cellular NADH and FAD
(26). Resolution is adequately high to isolate single cells,
allowing identiﬁcation of inﬂammatory inﬁltrates in the stroma and tumor epithelia. This single cell-level resolution may be
useful for identifying resistant subpopulations of cells that
preexist in the tumor and are responsible for cancer relapse.
Because OMI is inexpensive, fast, and directly measures
dynamic changes in cellular metabolism that reﬂect glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolic enzyme
microenvironment interactions, we investigated the potential of OMI as a tool for monitoring metabolic response to
targeted therapies in human breast cancer cells and xenografts. OMI was validated by measuring metabolic inhibition
by cyanide, and in comparison with standard assays of
glycolytic metabolism. The sensitivity of OMI to breast
cancer subtypes was conﬁrmed. Finally, the OMI-measured
response of mouse xenograft models treated with trastuzumab was compared with FDG-PET, IHC, and tumor size
measurements. This work represents a signiﬁcant advancement in the tools available to study cellular metabolism and
tumor response to treatment in living systems.

Materials and Methods
Fluorescence lifetime instrumentation
A custom built, commercial multiphoton ﬂuorescence
microscope (Prairie Technologies) was used to acquire ﬂuorescence images. A 40X water-immersion objective (1.15 NA) or
a 40X oil-immersion objective (1.3 NA) coupled the excitation

www.aacrjournals.org

and emitted light through an inverted microscope (TiE, Nikon).
A titanium:sapphire laser (Coherent Inc.) was tuned to 750 nm
for excitation of NADH and 890 nm for FAD excitation. The
average laser power was 7.5 to 7.8 mW for NADH and 8.4–to 8.6
mW for FAD. A pixel dwell time of 4.8 ms was used. A GaAsP
PMT (H7422P-40, Hamamatsu) detected emitted photons. A
400 to 480 nm bandpass ﬁlter isolated NADH ﬂuorescence. A
500 nm high pass dichroic mirror and a 500 to 600 nm bandpass
ﬁlter isolated FAD ﬂuorescence.
Fluorescence lifetime images were acquired using time
correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) electronics
(SPC-150, Becker and Hickl). TCSPC uses a fast detector PMT
to measure the time between a laser pulse and ﬂuorescence
event. Each image of 256  256 pixels was acquired using an
integration time of 60 seconds. No change in the photon count
rate was observed, ensuring that photobleaching did not occur.
The instrument response function (measured from the second
harmonic generated signal of urea crystals excited at 900 nm)
full width at half maximum was measured to be 260 ps. The
single-component ﬂuorescence lifetime of a ﬂuorescent bead
(Polysciences Inc.) was measured daily. The measured ﬂuorescence lifetime of the bead was 2.1  0.08 ns (n ¼ 18), which is
consistent with published studies (20, 27).
Cell culture
All cell lines were acquired from the American Type Culture
Collection except the HR6 cell line (28), which was provided by
the Arteaga Laboratory. The noncancerous mammary epithelium cell line, MCF10A, was cultured in MEBM (Lonza) supplemented with cholera toxin, penicillin: streptomycin, bovine
pituitary extract, hydrocortisone, insulin, and human epidermal growth factor. All malignant cell lines were grown in
DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin: streptomycin. The growth media for the HR6 cell line was further
enhanced with 25 mg/mL trastuzumab (Vanderbilt Pharmacy).
For ﬂuorescence imaging, cells were plated at a density of 106
cells per 35 mm glass-bottom imaging dish (MatTek Corp.) 48
hours before imaging.
The MCF10A cell line was used as a daily ﬂuorescence
standard for the redox ratio and imaged each day measurements were acquired. All other cell lines were imaged on at
least two different days. A total of 18 different locations were
imaged for each cell line (58 for MCF10A cells) from six
different dishes (three images were acquired from each dish,
see Supplementary Table S1).
Cyanide experiment
NADH and FAD ﬂuorescence lifetime images of three locations of three dishes were acquired. Media of two of the
MCF10A dishes was removed and replaced with cyanide
supplemented MCF10A growth media (4 mmol/L NaCN, Sigma). The cells were allowed 5 minutes for the cyanide to react
and post-cyanide NADH and FAD ﬂuorescence images were
acquired from three unique locations from each dish.
Trastuzumab perturbation
The effect of HER2 inhibition by trastuzumab was tested in
HER2-overexpressing cells. The cells were plated at a density of

106 cells per imaging dish, 48 hours before imaging. At 24 hours
before imaging, the growth media was exchanged for growth
media containing 25 mg/mL trastuzumab. This dose of trastuzumab, 25 mg/mL, was chosen to mimic therapeutic drug
dosage in patients (29).
Mouse xenografts
This study was approved by the Vanderbilt University
Animal Care and Use Committee and meets the NIH guidelines
for animal welfare. MDA-MB-361 cells (106), BT474 cells (108),
or HR6 cells (108) in 100 mL Matrigel were injected in the
inguinal mammary fat pads of female athymic nude mice (J:NU;
Jackson Laboratories). Tumors were allowed to grow to
approximately 150 mm3. Tumor-bearing mice were treated
with trastuzumab (Vanderbilt University Medical Center pharmacy) or control human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 10 mg/kg
twice weekly for two weeks. This dose of trastuzumab was
chosen to mimic therapeutic drug dosage in patients (30).
OMI xenograft imaging
Isoﬂurane-anesthetized mice were used for vital imaging, by
removing the skin overlying the tumor, overlaying the tumor
with a coverslip, and placing the mouse on the microscope
stage. NADH and FAD ﬂuorescence lifetime images of three
different tumor locations were acquired each day. After imaging, mice were humanely euthanized while under anesthesia.
Each OMI group contained 3 mice, each with 2 tumors for a
total n of 6 tumors at each time point.
FDG-PET imaging
The FDG-PET protocol follows published methods
(7, 31, 32). The mice were fasted overnight and allowed to
acclimate to the PET facility for 1 hour on a warm water pad.
A single retroorbital injection of approximately 200 mCi (100
mL) of [18F]FDG was administered. Following a 40-minute
distribution period, 20-minute static PET scans were collected on a Concorde Microsystems microPET Focus 220
(Siemens), whereas mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane.
PET images were reconstructed using the ordered subsets
expectation maximization algorithm (33). FDG-uptake
values were obtained by isolating the uptake of each tumor
volume and correcting for the injected dose. Each FDG-PET
group contained 5 mice, each with 2 tumors for a total n
of 10 tumors.
Quantiﬁcation of the optical redox ratio
The optical redox ratio was computed from the NADH
and FAD ﬂuorescence lifetime data. The photons detected
at each pixel in an image were integrated over time to
compute the sum of photons per pixel. The total number
of NADH photons was divided by the total number of FAD
photons at each pixel to create a redox ratio image
(MATLAB, MathWorks). The redox ratio image was thresholded to remove background and nuclear ﬂuorescence
and the average redox ratio for the remaining cell cytoplasms was computed. This approach has been conﬁrmed
to be consistent with redox ratios obtained with steady-state
detection (8, 21).

Quantiﬁcation of ﬂuorescence lifetime components
For each image, a threshold was selected to eliminate
background and nuclear ﬂuorescence (SPCImage, Becker
and Hickl). A binning of nine surrounding pixels was used.
Then, the ﬂuorescence lifetime components were computed
for each pixel by deconvolving the measured system
response and ﬁtting the resulting exponential decay to a
two-component model, IðtÞ ¼ a1 expt=t1 þ a2 expt=t2 þ C,
where I(t) is the ﬂuorescence intensity at time t after the
laser excitation pulse, a1 and a2 are the fractional contributions of the short and long lifetime components, respectively (i.e., a1 þ a2 ¼ 1), t 1 and t 2 are the ﬂuorescence
lifetimes of the short and long lifetime components, and
C accounts for background light. A two-component decay
was used to represent the lifetimes of the free and bound
conﬁgurations of NADH and FAD (20, 23, 24). The average
lifetime component values and a mean ﬂuorescence lifetime
ðt m ¼ a1 t 1 þ a2 t 2 Þ for each image were computed in
MATLAB.
Statistical analysis
A rank sum test of means was used to test for signiﬁcant
differences due to cyanide. A Bonferroni correction for multiple-comparisons was used on rank sum tests of means of the
metabolic values from the panel of cell lines. A rank sum test of
means was used to identify signiﬁcant differences when cell
lines were treated with trastuzumab and to ﬁnd differences in
the in vivo xenograft experiments. A Student t test of means
tested for signiﬁcantly different FDG-uptake values between
control and trastuzumab-treated xenografts. For all statistical
tests, an asigniﬁcance level of 0.05 was used and the test was
assumed to be two-way.
Spearman rank correlation coefﬁcient was used to identify
correlations. Both a correlation coefﬁcient (r) and a P value
were computed. An a level of less than 0.05 signiﬁed signiﬁcance. Scatterplots of the signiﬁcant correlations conﬁrmed
that the correlation was due to data trends and not a single
outlier.
Computation of intra- and intercellular variation
Intercellular variation was visualized by histogram representation of the mean metabolic measure (optical redox ratio,
NADH t m, or FAD t m) for all cells. The histogram was ﬁt to one,
two, and three component Gaussian curves to determine the
number of modes within the data. The ﬁt with the lowest
Akaike information criterion was selected to represent the
probability density function of the histogram (34). Intracellular
variation was computed as the average coefﬁcient of variation
(SD divided by mean) for each cell and averaged over all cells.
Percentage of mitotic cells
The percentage of proliferating cells was measured by ﬂow
cytometry. Cells were plated at a density of 106 cells per 35 mm
dish. After 48 hours, the cells were labeled with PhosphoHistone H3 (Ser10) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology)
and a secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit
IgG (Invitrogen) enabled detection of labeled cells by ﬂow
cytometry.

Glycolytic index
Media glucose and lactate concentrations were measured using standard assay kits [Amplex Red Glucose/Glucose
Oxidase Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and L-Lactate Assay Kit (Eton
Bioscience Inc.)]. Concentrations of glucose and lactate
in the cell growth media were determined at the time of
plating (0 hour) and at the time of imaging (48 hour). The
"glycolytic index" was computed as the moles of glucose
consumed within 48 hours divided by the moles of lactate
produced in 48 hours.
Histologic analysis
Tumors were collected and placed in buffered formalin,
parafﬁn embedded, sliced, and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin stain. Additional slides were stained for Ki-67 and
cleaved caspase-3. Staining protocols were veriﬁed in positive control samples. The percentage of positively stained
cells was quantiﬁed from ﬁve ﬁelds of view from three
tumors in each group.

Results
Figure 1A shows the relationship between HER2 and the
ﬂuorescent molecules NADH and FAD. HER2 activation
drives an increase in glycolysis, which generates NADH.
The pyruvate produced in glycolysis can enter the mitochondria as a reactant in oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation consumes NADH and produces FAD. A
net gain of NADH relative to FAD is observed with HER2
activation due to a relative increase in glycolysis.
Validation
Chemical inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation affects
the relative ﬂuorescence intensities of NADH and FAD in a
cell (35), so this perturbation was used to validate the optical
imaging approach (Fig. 1B–D, Supplementary Fig. S1). Cyanide
(which disrupts the electron transport chain) induced the
predicted trends 23, 27): an increase in the optical redox ratio
and a decrease in NADH t m. Unreported until now, FAD t m
increased with cyanide treatment.
Metabolic proﬁling of breast cancer cells
High-resolution images (Fig. 2) allowed visualization of
cellular morphology and cell-to-cell variability of the optical redox ratio and NADH and FAD ﬂuorescence lifetimes
for human breast cell lines (Supplementary Table S1). Cellular ﬂuorescence localized to the cytoplasm of cells. ERþ/
HER2 cells displayed increased redox ratios over that seen
in triple-negative cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 3A), and the greatest
redox ratios were measured in HER2 gene-ampliﬁed cells
(P < 0.001). To account for any differences in cellular proliferation rates among the cell lines and show that the redox ratio
is not a reporter of cellular proliferation (Supplementary
Fig. S2A), we normalized the redox ratio to the percentage
mitotic cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B) and found similar
trends, increased redox ratio/percentage mitotic cells in
ERþ cells and the greatest redox ratio/percentage mitotic cells
in HER2þ cells.

exhibited the shortest NADH t m. Reduced-free and proteinbound NADH lifetimes (t 1 and t 2) were observed in the triplenegative and ERþ cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). The
portion of free NADH (a1) was decreased in the HER2þ cells
compared with the nonmalignant cells (Supplementary Fig.

increased in all malignant cells (P < 0.001), with the longest

acquired resistance to trastuzumab in vivo (28). The redox
ratio (P < 0.05), NADH t m (P < 0.05), and FAD t m (P < 0.001)
of BT474 cells decreased upon trastuzumab treatment for
24 hours (Fig. 4A–C). Lifetime component analysis showed
signiﬁcant increases in the portions of free NADH (a1) and
bound FAD (a1) of BT474 cells treated with trastuzumab
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Similarly, the redox ratio of the
MDA-MB-361 cells decreased (P < 0.05) with trastuzumab
treatment (Fig. 4A). The high-resolution OMI enabled analysis of cellular heterogeneity in response to trastuzumab
(Fig. 4D, Supplementary Fig. S6). Distribution modeling of
cellular redox ratios of MDA-MB-361 cells revealed two
subpopulations characterized by differing redox ratios (Fig.
4D). The mean redox ratio of the ﬁrst population, representing 70% of cells, showed no change (1.34 to 1.31) upon
trastuzumab treatment (P ¼ 0.07), suggesting that trastuzumab did not affect metabolic processes in the majority of
MDA-MB-361 cells. However, 30% of the cells responded
to trastuzumab with a mean redox ratio that decreased from
1.89 to 1.65 (P < 0.001).
HR6 cells are a trastuzumab-resistant BT474-derived subline that retains HER2 overexpression. Previous studies have
shown maintenance of HER2 overexpression and PI3K/Akt
signaling in trastuzumab-treated HR6 cells (28). Consistent
with this observation, the redox ratio remained unchanged
upon treatment with trastuzumab, as was FAD t m. NADH
t m decreased in HR6 cells upon treatment with the antibody

(P < 0.05; Fig. 4A–C). An increased portion of free NADH
(a1) contributed to the decreased NADH t m observed in
the HR6 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
In vivo xenografts
To verify the OMI response observed in cultured cells, we
conducted OMI on HER2-overexpressing xenografts and compared these ﬁndings with tumor size, IHC, and FDG-PET
measurements. Established BT474 xenografts treated with
control IgG continued to grow throughout the course of the
experiment while the trastuzumab-treated tumors decreased
in size (Fig. 5A). IHC staining conﬁrmed lower rates of proliferation and higher rates of apoptosis in the trastuzumabtreated group (Fig. 5B and C). A representative FDG-PET image
displays the location of the tumors in the mammary fat near
the hind limbs and shows increased FDG-uptake in the tumors
compared with the surrounding tissue (Fig. 5D). FDG-uptake
increased in the control mice between days 2 and 12 posttreatment; however, no difference was observed between
control and trastuzumab-treated tumors at any time point
(day 2, 5, or 12 posttreatment; Fig. 5E). OMI imaging of an
identical cohort of tumors allowed cellular-level visualization
of metabolism (Fig. 5F) and resolved metabolic differences in
the redox ratio (Fig. 5G), NADH t m (Fig. 5H, Supplementary Fig.
S7A–S7C), and FAD t m (Fig. 5I, Supplementary Fig. S7) between
control and trastuzumab-responding tumors as early as 2 days
after the ﬁrst dose of trastuzumab.

was observed between control and trastuzumab-treated
tumors at any time point; however, the FDG-uptake was
increased in the control mice at 12 days compared with 2
days (Fig. 6E). No difference was observed in the redox ratio
between control and treated HR6 tumors at any time point
(Fig. 6F and G). NADH t m decreased in the HR6-treated tumors
relative to controls at 2 days posttreatment, but was similar
to controls at days 5 and 14 (Fig. 6H, Supplementary Fig. S8).
No change in FAD tm was observed at any time point (Fig. 6I,
Supplementary Fig. S8).
The redox ratio (P < 0.05), NADH t m (P < 0.05), and FAD t m
(P < 0.05) decreased in trastuzumab-treated MDA-MB-361
xenografts as compared with IgG-treated controls (Fig. 7A–
D; Supplementary Fig. S9) 2 days after treatment. Modeling
of the optical redox ratio and FAD t m values on a cell-by-cell
basis (intercell variability) identiﬁed two subpopulations
of tumor cells in trastuzumab-treated animals, whereas an
unimodal cellular distribution was identiﬁed for NADH t m
(Fig. 7E–G). High-resolution analysis revealed that intracellular variability in redox ratios and FAD t m increased

(P < 0.05) in trastuzumab-treated samples (Fig. 7H). These
results fully characterize OMI and show its potential for
monitoring early-drug response in cell culture and mouse
xenografts on a single-cell level.

Discussion
OMI is advantageous for live cell and animal imaging due to
several features, including direct and dynamic assessment of
cellular metabolism in vivo, cellular and subcellular resolution
imaging capabilities, rapid acquisition, low-cost, use of intrinsic signals (no contrast agents, no radioactivity), and high
sensitivity to metabolic changes. Our results have signiﬁcant
implications for rapid assessment of drug action in preclinical
models, which would greatly accelerate drug development
studies.
These results are the ﬁrst to correlate OMI with a standard
assay of metabolic behavior. Although the optical redox ratio
is inferred from theory as the relative rates of glycolysis and
oxidative phosphorylation within cells, we conﬁrm a strong

positive correlation (r ¼ 0.89, P ¼ 0.03) with a standard
measure of cellular glycolytic levels (Fig. 3). In contrast, NADH
t m and FAD t m are not correlated with the glycolytic index
(Supplementary Table S2). The proportion of free NADH (a1)
has been interpreted as an analog to the optical redox
ratio (27); however, we did not ﬁnd a correlation between the
optical redox ratio and NADH a1 (Supplementary Table S2).
Given the physical nature of these ﬂuorescence lifetime measurements, which are sensitive to protein-binding, relative
fractions of free and bound components, and proximity to
quenchers, it is not surprising that they are sensitive to more
cellular processes than just glycolysis. For example, changes
in the distribution of NADH and FAD enzyme–binding sites
associated with preferred metabolic pathways in breast
cancer subtypes may be responsible for the changes in protein-bound lifetimes between cell lines (36). The changes in
the lifetimes of the free components of NADH and FAD may
reﬂect changes in dynamic quenching (22). Taken together,
the data (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S2) indicate that the
redox ratio, NADH, and FAD lifetimes provide independent
measures of cellular metabolism and the molecular microenvironment. The varied dynamics of these endpoints due to
HER2 inhibition suggest that all three OMI endpoints provide
added value when measured together.
We used these tools to differentiate breast cancer cells by
subtype, deﬁned by ER, and/or HER2 expression or absence
(Fig. 3). OMI is sensitive to metabolic behaviors caused by ER
and HER2 (Fig. 3), known oncogenic drivers of glycolytic
metabolism in breast cancer cells (3, 8, 37, 38). ER regulates
gene expression of glucose transporter proteins and proteins
involved in oxidative phosphorylation and the citric acid
cycle such as isocitrate dehydrogenase, which actively reduces
NADþ to NADH (37, 39–41). HER2 mediates metabolism
through signaling of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which
directs transcription of glycolytic enzymes (2, 3). When combined, the redox ratio and NADH lifetime fully separate the
distinct subtypes of breast cancer (Fig. 3D), indicating that
the complementary measures of the redox ratio and ﬂuorescence lifetime allow robust characterization of cellular metabolism and molecular microenvironments associated with
breast cancer subtypes.
We further show that the OMI endpoints optical redox ratio,
NADH t m, and FAD t m, reﬂect impaired metabolic activity in
trastuzumab-responsive BT474 cells (Fig. 4) in vitro, suggesting
a large metabolic response of HER2-ampliﬁed cells to trastuzumab. Only one of the OMI endpoints, NADH t m, decreased
in the trastuzumab-resistant HR6 cells (Fig. 4). Although HR6
cells maintain HER2-overexpression and PTEN and P-Akt
protein levels in the presence of trastuzumab, blockage of
HER2 with trastuzumab may affect internal signaling (28).
Because of its highly sensitive nature, NADH t m may be
reporting such minute metabolism differences.
A subset of variables also resolved metabolic changes
induced by trastuzumab in poorly responsive HER2-ampliﬁed
cells (MDA-MB-361) in vitro (Fig. 4). Behavioral heterogeneity
inherent to the MDA-MB-361 cell line suggests that 25% of
the overall population would be growth inhibited by trastuzumab in vitro (42). Our data detected a 30% subpopulation

6172

Cancer Res; 73(20) October 15, 2013

within MDA-MB-361 cells that responded to trastuzumab
through decreased redox ratios (Fig. 4D), suggesting correlative evidence that high-resolution optical imaging is capable
of detecting responders and nonresponders at the single-cell
level in the context of a heterogeneous tumor cell population
with a mixed response. The complementary metabolic information gained from the OMI endpoints allowed identiﬁcation of a large metabolic response to trastuzumab (BT474)
but also resolved negative (HR6) and partial (MDA-MB-361)
responses, showing high sensitivity and resolution of OMI.
Finally, we measured the in vivo metabolic response to
trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing mouse xenografts. Trastuzumab-induced metabolic repression in BT474 and MDAMB-361 tumors was detected by 48 hours posttreatment (Figs.
5 and 7). The redox ratio and FAD t m did not change in
trastuzumab-resistant HR6 tumors treated with the antibody
(Fig. 6). However, NADH t m decreased in trastuzumab-treated
HR6 tumors compared with controls at 48 hours (Fig. 6), which
was consistent with the in vitro results (Fig. 4). Modeling of the
intercellular variation of MDA-MB-361 xenograft tumors identiﬁed two subpopulations in response to trastuzumab for the
optical redox ratio and FAD t m (Fig. 7), suggesting in vivo cellto-cell heterogeneity. This heterogeneous in vivo response is
consistent with the in vitro results (in Fig. 4). We attempted to
include only tumor cells in our image analysis, by evaluation of
the cell morphology with respect to histology, but acknowledge
that nontumor cell populations could have been included in
this analysis. We speculate the greater intracellular variation of
both the redox ratio and FAD t m observed in the MDA-MB-361
tumors treated with trastuzumab (Fig. 7H) is due to heterogeneous responses of individual mitochondria (43). Elucidation of this possibility will require additional research.
The tumor size measurements and IHC analysis of cellular
proliferation and apoptosis were consistent with an antitumor
effect of trastuzumab against BT474 tumors and a lack of an
effect against HR6 tumors (Figs. 5 and 6). Tumor size measurements ﬁrst identiﬁed a difference in control versus trastuzumab-treated BT474 tumor size at 8 days after treatment was
initiated (Fig. 5A), 6 days later than the ﬁrst signiﬁcant change
in OMI endpoints between control and trastuzumab-treated
tumors (day 2, Fig. 5G). Although Ki67 staining of BT474
tumors identiﬁed reduced proliferation in BT474 tumors treated with trastuzumab at 2 and 5 days posttreatment, OMI is
advantageous over IHC as a measure of tumor response
because OMI provides a dynamic measure of cellular metabolism and can be conducted in vivo and over time within the
same animal. Although in vivo OMI data are presented here,
OMI endpoints remain robust measures of metabolism in
freshly excised tissues (21) allowing implementation of this
metabolic imaging technique in situations when in vivo measurements are not feasible.
FDG-PET has also been explored as a potential tool for
assessing response to therapeutic agents. Consistent with a
prior study (7), in this study, FDG-PET failed to identify a
metabolic difference between control and trastuzumab-treated BT474 tumors (Fig. 5). FDG-uptake did increase over time
as the control tumors continued to grow. Unlike OMI, PET
cannot resolve cellular subpopulations of differing response

that are critical for investigating drug resistance mechanisms
(7, 13–17, 44). Furthermore, PET requires large upfront and
continued costs due to radiolabeled tracers, whereas OMI can
be implemented in low-cost, wide-ﬁeld, or confocal microscopes without the need for external dyes (45–47). In addition,
OMI allows for fast, accurate, dynamic in vivo monitoring of
early-therapeutic response, potentially reducing time and animals required for drug development. Our studies have focused
on breast cancer and HER2 inhibition, but the methods developed are also applicable to the array of diseases that are treated
with metabolism-modulating drugs (48–50).
The results of this study validate OMI as a powerful tool for
quantifying cellular metabolism, which is an active area of
investigation across multiple diseases. As we show using
human breast cancer cells and xenografts, optical metabolic
measurements are sensitive to distinct tumor cell subtypes. In
addition, we present signiﬁcant ﬁndings suggesting that OMI
can be used as an early indicator of metabolic response to
treatment with a targeted therapy, both in cell culture and in
vivo. These results represent the culmination of multiple
imaging technologies, analysis tools, and their validation with
standard assays and FDG-PET. The results in breast cancer
cells and xenografts provide the ﬁrst direct measurements
relating cellular metabolism, HER2 expression, HER2 inhibition, and resistance to HER2 inhibitors in live cells and tissues.
In addition, these methodologies are potentially broadly applicable outside the cancer and imaging communities, including
those in drug development and metabolism research across
multiple diseases. Although we see OMI as an immediately
powerful tool in preclinical models, it also may directly impact
patient care as an adjunct to current practice, either on freshly

excised tissue (21) or through in vivo endoscopes adapted for
ﬂuorescence imaging.
