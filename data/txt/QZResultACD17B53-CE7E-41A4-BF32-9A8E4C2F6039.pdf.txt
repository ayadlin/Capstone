ABSTRACT
Prostate apoptosis response-4 (PAR-4) is considered as a tumour suppressor due
to its ability to selectively induce cell apoptosis in most cancer cells. However little
is known about the role of PAR-4 in ovarian cancer. In this study, we investigated
for the first time the role of PAR-4 in ovarian carcinogenesis. We showed that PAR-4
mRNA level is not significantly different between healthy and cancer ovarian cells.
Immunohistochemistry on ovarian tissue showed that ovarian cancer cells are
positive for PAR-4 nuclear and cytoplasmic staining whereas ovarian healthy cells
are negative for PAR-4 nuclear staining. We then studied the role of PAR-4 in cell
apoptosis. We determined that PAR-4 induces cell apoptosis in response to stimuli,
in vitro, but is also involved in the relocation of GRP78 from endoplasmic reticulum
to the cell surface of ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV-3 cells). In ovo, PAR-4 decreases
ovarian tumour development and increases the response to taxol treatment. These
observations suggest that PAR-4 is a very interesting therapeutic target against
ovarian carcinogenesis.

apoptosis induction in cancer cells (SAC domain)
[4–6]. PAR-4 is mainly localized in the cytoplasm but
it can also be translocated into the nucleus in cancer
cells upon cleavage by caspase-3. Once in the nucleus
is inhibits NF-kB activity and activates the caspasedependent apoptotic pathway. [7]. PAR-4 can also bind
to kinases such as PKCζ or Akt and inactivate their
ability to promote NFкB activation [8, 9]. It has also
been shown that PAR-4 interacts with the transcription
factor Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) causing the transcriptional
repression of B-cell lymphoma-2 (bcl-2) [10]. Moreover,
recent findings showed that secreted PAR-4 can induce
apoptosis by interacting with cell surface Glucose
regulated protein 78 (GRP78) in prostate cancer cells
[11]. GRP78, also known as BiP, is an endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) heat shock protein in ER but it is also
observed at the cell surface in many types of cancer
cells [12]. Interestingly, PAR-4 itself is involved in the
relocation of GRP78 from ER to the cell surface [11, 13].
The presence of GRP78 at the cell surface is extensively
described in cancer cells where membranous GRP78 has

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death for
gynaecological cancers and the seventh highest cause of
cancer death in women [1]. The International Federation
of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classifies ovarian
cancer in 4 main stages which progressively increase
in severity [2]. This disease is generally detected late at
stages 3 and 4 due to poor specificity of early detection
methods. The standard treatment combines surgical
cytoreduction with a combination of chemotherapies.
Despite this aggressive approach, the 5 year survival
rate is around 30% for all stages involved [3]. In order
to develop new therapeutic approaches, it is important to
better understand the pathological mechanisms involved in
ovarian tumorigenesis.
PAR-4 is a 40kDa protein expressed in various
tissues and is generally considered as a tumour
suppressor [4]. This protein contains three domains:
1) two putative nuclear localization sequences, 2) a
leucine-zipper domain and 3) a selective domain for

functions in enhancing cell invasion, proliferation and
migration in cancer cells [14, 15].
In cancer cells, the downregulation of PAR-4
activity can either be due to a decrease in mRNA levels
in the cell or to the inhibition of its activity. [9, 16, 17].
In general a couple of different factors can be responsible
for the inactivation of PAR-4 expression such as point
mutations or promoter methylation [4]. In cancer
cells, PAR-4 activity can be inhibited by 1) preventing
phosphorylation, which is necessary for its proapoptotic
activity [4], 2) sequestration of PAR-4 in the cytoplasm
by association with Akt1 or 3) reducing caspase-3
mediated PAR-4 cleavage and preventing apoptosis [7,
18]. Therefore, different studies have sought to prevent
the inhibition of PAR-4 activity. It has been shown that
treatment of mice with Akt inhibitors can activate PAR-4
and reduce tumour growth [19]. Further, another study has
demonstrated that the use of Bcl-2 or Src kinase inhibitors
results in the activation of PAR-4 and thus of the inhibition
of cell growth in pancreatic and colon cancer cells [20,
21]. Moreover, it has been shown that if PAR-4 expression
is increased in cancer cells, apoptosis is induced [22] and
there is a greater response to therapeutic agents and thus
tumour progression is reduced [23].
These properties of PAR-4 raise questions about its
role in ovarian cancer cell apoptosis and suggest PAR4 as a potential target for new therapeutics. However, it
has been demonstrated that PAR-4 could be involved in
GRP78 relocation from ER to the cell surface in prostate
cancer cells and trophoblastic cells [11, 13] supposing
also a potential role in GRP78 relocation in ovarian
cancer cells. At the moment, no previous work has been
performed on the role of PAR-4 in ovarian carcinogenesis
but PAR-4 has been observed in the ovary and in

human ovarian cancer cell lines [7, 24]. Thus, here, we
investigated for the first time the expression of PAR-4 in
serous ovarian cancer cells compared to healthy ovarian
cells. We explored its involvement in paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis, in GRP78 relocation from ER to ovarian cancer
cell surface. We finally investigated the role of PAR-4 in
tumour development in ovo.

RESULTS
Presence of PAR-4 in healthy and cancer tissues
We first examined PAR-4 mRNA expression in both
healthy (n = 12) and ovarian cancer cells (n = 18) by qRTPCR. As shown in Figure 1A, PAR-4 mRNA expression
doesn’t significantly differ between cells purified from
healthy and cancer tissues. We then evaluated the PAR4 location in healthy and cancer tissues (Figure 1Ba and
1Bb). The intensity of staining of cytoplasm and nucleus
is scored as absent (0), weak (1), moderate (2) and intense
(3) (Figure 1Bc). As shown in Figure 1B, PAR-4 is mainly
immunolocalised in the cytoplasm in healthy tissues
whereas it is found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm
in high grade serous ovarian cancer tissues.

Effect of PAR-4 on apoptosis
Based on previous studies showing that PAR-4 is
involved in apoptosis [4], we decided to investigate the
effect of PAR-4 on apoptosis of an ovarian cancer cell
line SKOV-3 under normal conditions or after paclitaxel
treatment. Under basal condition, PAR-4 levels do not
influence the activity of caspase-3/7 (Figure 2A), the
active caspase-3 level staining (Figure 2B) or the level

of cleaved PARP (Figure 2C). However, under taxol
treatment, PAR-4 overexpression increases the activity
of caspase3/7 (Figure 2A), active caspase-3 staining
(Figure 2B) and the cleaved-PARP expression (Figure 2C).
Similarly when PAR-4 expression is decreased, the
activity of caspase3/7 (Figure 2A) and the cleaved-PARP
expression (Figure 2B) were decreased. These results are
confirmed in another ovarian cancer cell line, A2780 cell
line (Supplementary Figure S1).
In addition, we observe that PAR-4 is mainly
localised in cytoplasm in non-treated cells and is found
in cytoplasm and nuclei after taxol treatment (Figure 2B).
Based on a study that showed the secreted form
of PAR-4 could bind membranous GRP78 and induce
apoptotic pathway [11], we assessed the effect of secreted
PAR-4 on cell apoptosis in presence of anti-PAR-4 and
anti-GRP78 antibodies (N20) (Figure 2D). Anti-N20
antibody is used to compete with secreted PAR-4 for
the binding to membranous GRP78 [11]. Under taxol
treatment, the activity of caspase-3/7 does not significantly
change between cells treated with anti-PAR-4 antibodies
or control mouse IgG in both the cells transfected with
the control plasmid and the PAR-4 expression plasmid
(Figure 2D). The treatment of SKOV-3 cells with antiGRP78 antibodies (N20) does not influence the activity
of caspase-3/7 for SKOV-3 cells transfected with control
plasmid or PAR-4 plasmid compared to untreated cells or
IgG treated cells respectively (Figure 2D).

To complete this finding, we tested the effect of
secreted PAR-4 using PAR-4 conditioned media on
SKOV-3 cell apoptosis. In order to do this, SKOV-3
cells were transfected with PAR-4 plasmid or control to
prepare conditioned medium. SKOV-3 cells in which
PAR-4 and GRP78 expression were increased were treated
with control or PAR-4 conditioned medium. Then, ICC
for active caspase-3 was performed to detect apoptosis.
PAR-4 conditioned medium has no effect on SKOV-3
cells apoptosis compared to the control medium either in
presence of taxol or not (Figure 2E).
These results suggest that secreted PAR-4 is not
involved in SKOV-3 cells apoptosis.

Colocalization of PAR-4 and GRP78
Previously, it has been shown that PAR-4 could
form a complex with GRP78 in the ER of prostate
cancer cells [11]. Here, we decided to confirm the
possibility that PAR-4 could bind to GRP78 in SKOV3 cells by co-immunoprecipitation and western
blot analysis (Figure 3A). We then investigated the
colocalization of PAR-4 and GRP78 in SKOV-3 cells
by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure 3B). PAR4 and GRP78 are mainly present in the cytoplasm. The
colocalized signal in yellow (Figure 3Bd) is found in the
cytoplasm and mainly in perinuclear region.

Effect of PAR-4 on GRP78 relocalization at the
ovarian cancer cell surface

First, PAR-4 silencing efficiency in SKOV-3
cells is evaluated by Western Blot (Figure 5A). Then,
tumours are observed by a haematoxylin and eosin (HE)
staining and the decrease in PAR-4 level in the shPAR-4
tumours compared to shControl tumours are checked by
immunohistochemistry (Figure 5B).
We first compared tumour size of shControl and
shPAR-4 at embryonic development day (EDD) 15. As
shown in Figure 5C, tumours with decreased PAR-4 level
are significantly larger than control tumours.
We then examined the effect of taxol on shControl
tumours or shPAR-4 tumours (Figure 5B). In presence of
25 μM of taxol, the size of shControl tumours decrease
about 40% while PAR-4 tumours doesn’t change in size
despite taxol treatment (Figure 5E).

We first determined that PAR-4 has no impact on
GRP78 expression or secretion (Supplementary Figure
S2). Then, we evaluated whether an increase or decrease
in PAR-4 levels could affect the location of GRP78 in
SKOV-3 cells. Figure 4A shows that overexpression
of PAR-4 increases the membranous level of GRP78 in
SKOV-3 compared to control plasmid transfected cells.
Similarly, a decrease in PAR-4 expression leads to a
decrease in cell surface expression of GRP78 (Figure 4B).
Glucose regulated protein 94 (Grp94), an ER molecular
chaperone, is not present at the cell surface in both
conditions suggesting that PAR-4 is involved in GRP78
relocation but not in the relocation of all ER proteins.

DISCUSSION

Role of PAR-4 on tumour development

PAR-4 is a tumour suppressor with intracellular
functions in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus [4]. In
cytoplasm, PAR-4 can bind protein kinases and inhibit
cell survival pathways [4]. Furthermore, PAR-4 can be
translocated to the nucleus where it inhibits the NF-ĸBmediated transcription of survival genes or the action of
TOPO1 [4]. However, PAR-4 mediated-apoptosis could

We then examined the role of PAR-4 on tumour
development using a CAM model (Figure 5). We have
established a stable SKOV-3 cell line where Par-4 is
diminished to investigate the effect of endogenous PAR-4
on tumour development and the response of the tumour to
taxol treatment.

be impeded in cancer cells either by a downregulation of
PAR-4 expression and/or by decreased activity of PAR-4
due to its non-phosphorylation or its sequestration in
cytoplasm preventing its entry into the nucleus [4].
Here, we examined, for the first time, the levels of PAR4 mRNA and its location in both healthy and high grade
serous cancerous human ovarian tissues. The levels of
PAR-4 mRNA and protein expression do not significantly
differ between healthy and high grade serous ovarian
cancer cells. It is mainly localized in the cytosol in
healthy ovarian tissues while its expression is seen in both
cytoplasm and nucleus of ovarian cancer cells suggesting
that PAR-4 could have a pro-apoptotic activity in ovarian
cancer cells as shown in different cancer cells.
Thus, we decided to explore the role of PAR-4 in
apoptosis of ovarian cancer cell lines. In contrast to most
cancer cell lines in which ectopic PAR-4 translocates
to the nucleus and induces apoptosis, in ovarian cancer
cell lines ectopic PAR-4 is mainly localized to the
cytoplasm and does not induce apoptosis. However, upon
taxol treatment, PAR-4 translocates to the nucleus and
increases taxol response in SKOV-3 cells suggesting that
taxol-induced apoptosis may be a result of the movement
of PAR-4 into the nucleus. The “apoptosis-sensitizing”
function of PAR-4 has already been described in hormonewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

responsive cancer cells [5]. It is generally attributed to its
sequestration in the cytoplasm. However, treatment with
apoptosis inducer translocates PAR-4 into the nucleus and
induces apoptosis. In taxol-treated SKOV-3 cells, nuclear
localization of PAR-4 is associated with increased caspase
3 activity. This is in accordance with the hypothesis that
caspase 3 is responsible for PAR-4 cleavage and thus its
entry into nucleus to induce apoptosis [7].
These observations made in ovarian cancer cell lines
suggest that nuclear location of PAR-4 in tissue could be
due to a stress activating a pathway leading to entry of
PAR-4 into the nucleus in vivo. It is also possible that
these ovarian cancer cell lines are not fully representative
of serous ovarian cancer.
We then investigated the role of secreted PAR-4 in
apoptosis of SKOV-3 cells. In some cancer cells, it was
shown that interaction of extracellular PAR-4 with cellsurface GRP78 induces apoptosis in a FADD-dependent
manner [11]. However, in SKOV-3 cells, and despite the
fact that ectopic PAR-4 increases GRP78 relocation at
the cell surface, treatment of SKOV-3 cells with PAR-4
conditioned medium does not induce apoptosis, even in
taxol treated cells. Moreover, the use of GRP78 or PAR-4
antibodies in culture medium to interfere within the
interaction between secreted PAR-4 and membranous

GRP78 does not impact PAR-4 induced apoptosis in taxoltreated cells suggesting that secreted PAR-4 does not play
a significant role in “apoptosis-sensitizing” function of
ovarian cancer cells.
We also investigated the role of endogenous PAR4 in the relocation of GRP78 from the ER to the cell
surface as it was described in other cancer cells [11, 13].
In physiological conditions, GRP78 is present in ER
and facilitates the folding and the assembly of newly
synthesized proteins, prevents protein aggregation during
stress conditions and participates in the regulation of
calcium homeostasis [12]. Although GRP78 has been
described as an ER luminal protein, it can also be found
in other cellular locations. In stressed cells or in most
cancer cells (including ovarian cancer cells [12]), GRP78
is overexpressed and found at the cell surface. At the
cell surface, it can bind other proteins such as alpha-2macroglobulin or cripto and thus induces signal pathways
involved in tumorigenesis [25, 26]. Membranous GRP78
has also the potential to form a complex with PAR-4 or
Kringle 5 resulting in the induction of the apoptosis
pathway [11, 27]. However, in this study, we demonstrate
that membrane GRP78 does not seem to play a major
role in PAR-4-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells.
Considering the significance of cell surface GRP78, it
was important to investigate the role of endogenous
PAR-4 in GRP78 relocation at cell surface of ovarian
cancer cells.
Thus, we first determined that PAR-4 and GRP78
colocalize in the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3
by immunofluorescence and further substantiated a
possible interaction between PAR-4 and GRP78 by
immunoprecipitation. It is found that neither increasing
nor decreasing PAR-4 expression has an impact on
total GRP78 levels indicating that GRP78 expression
is independent of PAR-4. Thus, we focused on the role
of PAR-4 in GRP78 relocation, and find that PAR-4 is
involved in the relocation of GRP78 from ER to the cell
surface in SKOV-3 cells, as indicated by the decreased
amount of membranous GRP78 with the decreased
PAR-4 expression. To supplement this finding, we
observed a significant correlation between levels of PAR4 mRNA and membranous GRP78 expression in purified
ovarian cells strengthening the hypothesis that PAR-4
participates in the GRP78 transport in ovarian cancer cells
(Supplementary Figure S3). It has also been shown that
GRP78 could be secreted into human peripheral circulation
and activates pro-survival pathways [28, 29]. We analysed
the secreted form of GRP78 in relation to the amount of
PAR-4 expressed in the cells and saw that changes in PAR4 expression don’t influence the level of secreted GRP78
suggesting that the role of PAR-4 in GRP78 relocation is
limited to its transport to the cell membrane.
PAR-4 could be a potential therapeutic target in
ovarian cancer due to its important role in apoptosis in
vitro. On the other hand, it could also induce relocation of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

GRP78 to cell surface where this last protein could mediate
some signalling pathways involved in tumorigenesis
[29]. To support PAR-4 as a potential therapeutic target
in ovarian cancer, we decided to investigate the role of
endogenous PAR-4 on ovarian tumour development using
a shPAR-4 SKOV-3 cell line and the in ovo CAM-assay.
We found that the downregulation of PAR-4 increased
ovarian tumour growth. It also reduces the effect of taxol
treatment on tumours. These results support the essential
role of PAR-4 in apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells.
In summary, our study suggests that PAR-4 triggers
apoptosis under apoptosis stimuli but also participates in the
relocation of GRP78 to the cell surface in ovarian cancer
cells. Using an in ovo model, we demonstrate that reducing
PAR-4 increases ovarian tumour development and decreases
the response to taxol suggesting that PAR-4 overexpression
could be an interesting pathway to target apoptosis and to
decrease tumour development in ovarian cancer.

for 8 minutes. The pellet was resuspended and cells were
counted and seeded in 3 cm dish.

Immunohistochemistry
Ovarian cancer tissues were rapidly washed with
0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 and
fixed for 4–12 hours in 4% buffered formalin at 4°C. The
specimens were then dehydrated in ethanol and embedded
in paraffin wax.
5 sections of human healthy ovarian tissue
and 5 sections of human ovarian cancer tissue were
deparaffinised and rehydrated through graded ethanol.
Antigen retrieval was performed by microwave pretreatment in 10 mmol/l citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5
minutes four times, followed by cooling in a cold water
bath. Non-specific binding was blocked with 3% (v/v)
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 30 minutes at
room temperature. The sections were incubated with
polyclonal rabbit anti-human PAR-4 (R-334) or with
control IgG (dilution 1/500 in 3% BSA-PBS) overnight
at 4°C. Sections were then washed with PBS and
incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (dilution 1/500)
for 1 hour. After washing, sections were stained with
diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen system (Dako, Baar,
Switzerland). The stained tissue was scored independently
by 2 experts. The intensity of cytoplasm and nucleus
staining was scored as absent (0), weak (1), moderate (2)
and intense (3).

Purification of cancer and healthy cells
Ovarian tissue (n = 15) was digested with 4 mg/ml
dispase (Gibco, Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) in HBSSHepes (filtered on 22 μm) containing 1 μg/ml Dnase
(Roche, Diagnostics GmbH, USA) for 30 minutes at 37°C.
Ovarian tissue and supernatant were put in 10 cm dish and
tissue was scrubbed with a scalpel. Then, the supernatant
was collected, neutralized with 5% FBS, filtered through
a 100 μm mesh (BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA) and
centrifuged at 800 g for 8 minutes. The resulting pellet
was resuspended in DMEM-10%FBS-0.05 mg/ml gen­
tamicin and cells were seeded in 3 cm dish. Cells were
characterized by PCR (CD90, HE4, PAX8, cytokeratin 8,
cytokeratin 19, cytovillin) and by immunocytochemistry
(cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 19, vimentin,
p53). Cells were used before passage 5.

Cell culture
SKOV-3 human ovarian cancer cells (ATCC
HTB-77TM) A2780 human ovarian cancer cells (ECACC
93112519) were cultured at 37°C under 5% CO2 in
Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (RPMI
1640, Gibco, Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) containing
10% fetal bovine serum and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin
(Gibco, Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland).

qRT-PCR
Expression of PAR-4 mRNA has been investigated
on purified cells from borderline tumor (n = 3), ovarian
healthy (n = 12) and high grade serous ovarian cancer
(n = 18) tissues or ascites. Reverse transcription was

Transfection

(dilution 1:800). The day after, cells were washed three
times in PBS and blocked again with PBS-3%BSA for
30 minutes. Cells were incubated for 1 hour with Alexa
Fluor-488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor-568
donkey anti-goat IgG or Alexa Fluor-568 donkey antimouse IgG. Cells were washed 5 times in PBS before
the addition of mounting medium containing DapiFluoromount-GTM (SouthernBiotech, Birmigham, USA).
A glass coverslip was put on slide and the sample was
analysed with LSM 510 META (Carl Zeiss Microscopy,
LLC, USA).
To evaluate the number of apoptotic cells,
an activated caspase-3 labeling apoptotic index
was performed. For each condition, 2 fields with a
magnification of 200 were counted for DAPI staining
and active caspase-3 staining. Then, the percentage of
apoptosis is calculated as follows: number of cells with
positive active caspase-3 staining over total number of
cells (DAPI staining) X100.

For siRNA transfection, 1.2 × 106 SKOV-3 or
A2780 cells were plated in a 10 cm dish and immediately
transfected with 10 nM of control or PAR-4 siRNA. 16
hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded
for 48 hours for cell ELISA, cell viability, invasion
assays as well as apoptosis analysis. Transfection was
performed using INTERFERin (Polyplus, Illkrich, France)
following the reverse transfection protocol provided by
the manufacturer. For plasmid transfection, 1.2 × 106 cells
were plated and incubated at 37°C for 16 hours. Cells were
transfected with control or PAR-4 expressing plasmid
or GRP78 expressing plasmid using jetPEI (Polyplus,
Illkrich, France) following the manufacturer instructions.
16 hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized, seeded
in appropriate dish and incubated for 48 hours. The
experiment was carried out in triplicate.

Establishment of stable cell lines

Co-immunoprecipitation

8 × 105 SKOV-3 cells were seeded in 6 cm dish. The
next day, the SKOV-3 cells were transfected with control
or PAR-4 shRNA plasmid using jetPEI reagent following
the manufacturer’s instructions. At 48 h post-transfection,
SKOV-3 cells, which have integrated plasmid, were
selected with RPMI-1640 complemented with 4 ug/ml of
puromycin (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Every 2
days, the medium was changed to select transfected cells.

2 × 106 SKOV-3 cells were plated in 10 cm-dish for
24 hours before being lysed in a buffer containing 10 mM
Tris-HCl, 1% Triton, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 0.5%
NP-40, and protease inhibitors cocktail (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland). Protein concentration was determined by
BioRad assay (BioRad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France).
400 μg of total proteins were subjected to preclearing
with 1 μg of IgG antibodies and 10 μL of red protein G
sepharose beads (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA)
for 1 hour. The sample was centrifuged at 8000 g for
5 minutes. Then, the lysate was immunoprecipitated
overnight at 4°C with 4 μg of antibodies against target
protein or IgG control antibodies. Then, 50 μL of red
protein G sepharose beads were added for 1 hour. The
immunoprecipitate was washed with lysis buffer and the
entire volume was subject to Western blotting analysis.

Activity of caspase-3/7
Transfected cells were seeded at 3 × 104 cells/well
in a 96-well plate for 24 hours. Cells were then treated
or not with 100 nM of taxol and incubated with 2.5 ug/
ml of anti-PAR-4 antibodies, anti-GRP78 antibodies
(N20) or control IgG for 24 hours. The activity of
caspase-3/7 was measured with a Caspase-GloR 3/7
Assay kit (Promega, Madison, USA), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions, using GloMaxTM 96
Microplate Luminometer (Promega, Madison, USA). The
experiment was carried out in triplicate.

Western blot
Proteins (8 μg for subcellular fraction or 20 μg for
total proteins) were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblot
analysis using mouse monoclonal anti-PAR-4 antibodies
(3G9H7, dilution 1:3000), rabbit polyclonal anti-GRP78
antibodies ( Gl19, dilution 1:3000), mouse monoclonal
anti-actin antibodies (dilution 1:5000) or mouse
polyclonal anti-GAPDH antibodies (dilution 1:5000).
Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse-HRP (dilution
1:3000) and anti-rabbit-HRP (dilution 1:3000). All
primary antibodies were diluted in 5% PBS-milk and
incubated overnight at 4°C for and secondary antibodies
were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Specific
signal was detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL
kit (GE Healthcare, Zurich, Switzerland). The experiment
was carried out in triplicate.

Immunofluorescence and apoptosis scoring
SKOV-3 cells were seeded into Lab-tek chamber
slide 8 wells (2 × 104 cells/well) and cultured as described
above. After 24 hours, cells were washed in Phosphate
Buffer Saline (PBS), fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for 15 minutes and washed 3 times in PBS. Cells
were permeabilized with ice cold methanol for 3 minutes
and washed again three times in PBS. Afterwards, nonspecific sites were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 30
minutes and incubated overnight at 4°C with polyclonal
rabbit antibodies against PAR-4 (R-334, dilution 1:100) or
polyclonal goat antibodies against GRP78 (C-20, dilution
1:100) or human/mouse active caspase-3 antibodies

Subcellular fractionation

On EDD4, rotation was stopped and eggs were
drilled at their narrow apex. The hole was closed with
adhesive tape. Incubation was carried out until use.
On EDD8, the hole at the apex was enlarged
and after gently scratching of the membrane with a
needle tip, a silicon O-ring (Apple Rubber products
inc., Lancaster, USA) was placed onto a blood
vessel crossing. SKOV-3 cells were resuspended at
2 × 106cells in 35ul of a mixture containing 50% of
RPMI-1640 (containing 10% fetal bovine serum and
0.05 mg/ml gentamicin) and 50% of BD Matrigel TM as
a basement membrane matrix (BD biosciences, Bedford,
USA). Then, this suspension was placed into the silicon
O-ring. The hole in the egg shell was hermetically
covered with Parafilm® and eggs were returned to the
incubator.
On EDD 15, tumor growth was monitored using
a Lumenera INFINITY2–1 CDD camera with Infinity
Capture Software. Then, tumor was treated topicallywith
25 μl of 25 μM taxol diluted in complete medium for 2
days into the incubator.
On EDD 17, tumor growth was again monitored.
The size of tumor was analyzed with the ImageJ
software.

1 × 106 SKOV-3 cells were plated into 10 cm dish and
transfected as described above. After 48 hours, cells were
harvested in 0.5 ml lysis buffer and cell lysate was passed
through a 25 G needle 10 times and centrifuged at 720 g
for 5 minutes to obtain the pelleted nuclear fraction. The
supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10 000 g for
10 minutes to get the pelleted mitochondrial fraction. At this
step, the supernatant contained both cytosolic and membrane
fractions. To separate these two fractions, the supernatant was
centrifuged at 40 000 g for 1 hour. The resulting pellet was
the membrane fraction and supernatant was the cytosolic one.
All fractions, except the cytosolic one, were washed
with subcellular fraction buffer (250 mM Sucrose, 20
mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT and protease
inhibitors cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)) and
passed through a 25 G needle 10 times. The different
fractions were centrifuged again and resuspended in lysis
buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol and 0.1% SDS.
The cytosolic fraction was concentrated on a centricon
(Millipore, Zug, Switzerland). The protein concentration
in each fraction was determined by BioRad assay. The
experiment was carried out in three times.

Statistical analysis

Cell ELISA

Data were expressed as mean ± SEM for n different
samples. P values were calculated using the Student’s
t test and the p value < 0.05 was considered significant. A
Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the
correlation between PAR-4 mRNA and relative expression
of membrane GRP78.

Transfected SKOV-3 cells or purified ovarian cells
were seeded at 2 × 104 and 3 × 104 cells/well respectively
in a 96-well plate. Cells were either incubated directly
with the primary antibodies or washed, fixed (3% PFA in
PBS), washed, permeabilized (0.2% triton in PBS) and
pre-incubated with culture medium (30 minutes) before
incubation with anti-GRP78 antibodies (Sigma Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA) for 45 minutes (dilution : 1/200). To
remove the unbound antibodies, cells were washed four
times in culture medium, and then incubated 30 minutes
at 4°C with HRP conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody
(dilution : 1/500). After incubation, cells were washed as
described above and the substrate 3, 3′, 5, 5′- tertramethyl
benzidine (MTT) (R&D systems, Minneapolis, USA)
was added. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.2 M
sulphuric acid. Absorbance was read at 450 nm on a
microplate reader. These experiments were carried out in
triplicate, three times.
