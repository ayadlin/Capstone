Abstract
Toll-like receptors (TLR) are expressed by a variety of cancers, including melanoma, but their functional
contributions in cancer cells are uncertain. To approach this question, we evaluated the effects of stimulating or
inhibiting the TLR/IL-1 receptor-associated kinases IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 in melanoma cells where their functions
are largely unexplored. TLRs and TLR-related proteins were variably expressed in melanoma cell lines, with 42%
expressing activated phospho-IRAK-1 constitutively and 85% expressing high levels of phospho-IRAK-4 in the
absence of TLR stimulation. Immunohistochemical evaluation of melanoma tumor biopsies (n ¼ 242) revealed
two distinct patient populations, one that expressed p-IRAK-4 levels similar to normal skin (55%) and one with
signiﬁcantly higher levels than normal skin (45%). Levels of p-IRAK-4 levels did not correlate with clinical stage,
gender, or age, but attenuated IRAK-1,-4 signaling with pharmacologic inhibitors or siRNA-enhanced cell death
in vitro in combination with vinblastine. Moreover, in a xenograft mouse model of melanoma, the combined
pharmacologic treatment delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival compared with subjects receiving single
agent therapy. We propose p-IRAK-4 as a novel inﬂammation and prosurvival marker in melanoma with the
potential to serve as a therapeutic target to enhance chemotherapeutic responses. Cancer Res; 72(23); 6209–16.

leukin (IL)-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) signaling
(8–10). IL-1, IL-18, and IL-33 can also activate IRAK signaling. IRAK-4 kinase activity is regulated by autophosphorylation (Ser346, Thr342, and Thr34; refs. 8–11), which in turn
can activate IRAK-1. IRAK-4,-1 activation results in the
downstream activation of various kinases and transcription
factors including JNK, AP-1, NF-kB, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), leading to the production of a
mixture of chemokines and proinﬂammatory cytokines
including TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 (12). IRAK signaling
can also induce the expression of several proteins involved in
cell survival and division (13).
In the current study, we examined the TLR and TLR signaling-related protein expression proﬁle on various melanoma
cell lines as well as the expression of the activated (phosphorylated) form of IRAK-4 on patient biopsies. Cytokine production and cell survival in response to stimulating or inhibiting
IRAK-1,-4 in melanomas were examined in vitro. In vivo, the
therapeutic efﬁcacy of combinatorial treatment with IRAK-1,-4
inhibitor plus chemotherapy was investigated in mice with an
established human melanoma tumor.

Materials and Methods

The incidence of melanoma has been on the rise in the
United States and worldwide over the last 30 years and has the
fastest rising cancer incidence in the United States (1–3).
Melanoma is the 5th/6th most common cancer in men and
women, respectively (1–3). The median survival of patients
with advanced disease is approximately 6 months and the
survival rate at 5 years is 6% and 45% for Stage III patients (1, 2).
Treatment failure is largely attributed to melanoma's resistance to all existing forms of cancer therapies.
Recent reports indicate that Toll-like receptors (TLR)
signaling within nonimmune cells, including several types
of human cancers, can contribute to cancer progression
(4–7). TLRs recognize infectious microorganisms as well as
endogenous signals released by dying or stressed cells. The
engagement of all known TLRs, except TLR3, initiates inter-

Melanoma cell lines
Human melanoma cell lines were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) within 2 years of manuscript
submission. Melanoma cell lines were initially expanded and
cryopreserved within 1 month of receipt. Cells were typically
used for 6 months, at which time a fresh vial of cryopreserved
cells was used. Malme-3M cells were maintained in Iscove's

Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium, and G361 in McCoy's 5a
Medium Modiﬁed. All media were purchased from Invitrogen
Life Technologies and supplemented with FBS, penicillin, and
streptomycin according to culture media recommended by
ATCC.
Western blotting and immunohistochemical staining
Total cell extracts were prepared from melanoma cells.
Proteins (20–30 mg/lane from cell lines) were resolved in
Tris-glycine SDS gels and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes. The membrane was blocked for 4 hours with
5% milk in PBS and 0.05% Tween-20, followed by incubation
with antibodies against TLR1 (N-23), phosphorylated (p)IRAK-1 (Ser 376), total IRAK-1 (H-273; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, TLR9, TRIF, IRAK-M, IRAK-4, Tollip,

TLR6 (3D10H11), TLR8 (44C143), TLR10, MyD88 (Abcam),
PARP, caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), overnight at 4 C and, subsequently, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody, and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Melanoma tissue arrays were purchased from US Biomax, Inc. For
immunohistochemical staining, samples were stained with
mouse monoclonal anti-human phosphor-IRAK-4 antibody
(Abnova; dilution, 3.5 mg/mL) or normal mouse serum. Tissue
histology sections (5-mm-thick) were deparafﬁnized, hydrated,
heated in boiling 10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH 6.0), for
antigen retrieval, for 30 minutes, and washed in Tris buffer.
Peroxide blocking was done with 3% H2O2 in methanol at room
temperature for 15 minutes, followed by 10% FBS in TBST for
30 minutes at room temperature. Primary antibody incubation
was done overnight at 4 C. Secondary antibody incubation
with horse anti-mouse (1:200; Vector Laboratories) was done
for 1 hour, followed by application of diaminobenzidine chromogen for 5 minutes. The slides were then counterstained
with haematoxylin and topped with a coverslip. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) specimens were analyzed using "quick
score" system in which the intensity of the immunohistochemical reaction was scored by multiplying the intensity 1 (weak), 2
(moderate), and 3 (strong) and the proportion of cells staining
positively 0 (<10%), 1 (10%–25%), 2 (26%–50%), 3 (51%–75%), or
4 (>75%). In some experiments, A375 cells were transfected via
electroporation (Amaxa, Program X-001, Lonza buffer L) with
siRNA-hIRAK-1 and siRNA-hIRAK-4 (5 mg/mL; InVivogen).
A375 melanoma xenograft model
NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ IL2RG (NSG) mice (Jackson
Laboratories) were subcutaneously injected with 2.5  106
A375 melanoma cells delivered in PBS. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved use of mice. When
tumors reached a size of approximately 50 mm2 mice were
injected intratumorally with 35 mg/kg of IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor or
an equal volume of vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO). Mice
were injected via intraperitoneal injection with vinblastine
(0.25 mg/kg) every 2 days for 5 days starting on the same day

that mice received with IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor. Tumor sizes were
analyzed using a mixed model approach for repeated measurements and mouse survival data were analyzed with the exact
log-rank test.
TLR agonists, IRAK inhibitor, chemotherapies, and ﬂow
cytometry
The TLR1-TLR2 ligand tripalmitoyl-S-(bis(palmitoyloxy)
propyl)-Cys-Ser-(Lys)3-Lys (Pam3CysK4) was purchased from
Invivogen. In some experiments we used the IRAK-1/4 inhibitor (EMD Millipore), which is a cell-permeable benzimidazole
compound that selectively inhibits IRAK-1 and -4 and exhibits
little activity against a panel of 27 other kinases. In some
experiments cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor and vinblastine, cisplatin, and 5ﬂuorouracil (Sigma-Aldrich), and apoptosis was quantitated by
ﬂow cytometry after staining cells with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Annexin-V (BD Pharmingen) and propidium
iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich).

Results and Discussion
TLR expression proﬁles on melanoma cell lines
Previous reports have shown the presence of TLR mRNA
transcripts and a limited number of TLRs by ﬂow cytometry
on human melanomas (4, 6). We examined in greater detail
the expression proﬁle of TLR1 through TLR10 and several
TLR-related signaling proteins on various melanoma cell
lines by Western blotting. With the exception of C32 and
Malme-3M, all melanoma cells expressed relatively high but
variable levels of TLR1 (Fig. 1A). Appreciable levels of TLR2
and TLR3 were detected in SK-Mel-2 and A375. TLR3 was
also moderately expressed on RPMI-7951 and G361 cells.
Most cell lines expressed variable levels of TLR4 and TLR7.
TLR5 was strongly expressed on SK-Mel, WM115, and A375,
moderately expressed on G361 and Malm-3M, but weakly
detected on C32 and RPMI-7951. TLR8 levels were low on
SK-Mel-2 and A375. TLR9 was strongly expressed on SK-Mel2 and WM115 and moderately expressed on Malm-3M and
G361. TLR10 expression was weak and variable on the
different cell lines. All cell lines expressed the TLR adapter
molecules MyD88 and TRIF.
IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 play a central role in TLR-mediated
signaling. All of the melanoma lines expressed high levels of
IRAK-4 and variable levels of IRAK-1 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly,
total IRAK-1 as well as the activated form of IRAK-1 (phosphorylated at serine 376; p-IRAK-1) was strongly expressed in
Malme-3M, SK-MEL-2, and A375, speciﬁcally in the absence of
exogenous TLR agonists. Similarly, variable levels of p-IRAK-4
(at threonine 345) were detected in melanoma cells (Fig. 1A).
We also examined whether TLR stimulation could augment pIRAK levels in cells that expressed IRAK or induce p-IRAK in
cells deﬁcient in this protein. However, p-IRAK levels in A375
cells, which express relatively high p-IRAK-1 and p-IRAK-4,
remained unchanged following TLR1-TLR2 stimulation suggesting that phosphorylated levels may already be at or near
the maximum, Supplementary Fig. S5B. In G361 cells, which
express low levels of p-IRAK-1 (and which express TLR5),
neither TLR1-TLR2 agonist (Pam3CysK4) nor TLR5 (Flagellin)

Figure 1. TLR and TLR signaling-related protein expression proﬁles on melanoma cell lines. A, the expression levels of TLR1-TLR10 and various TLR-related
proteins were examined by Western blotting in samples from human melanoma cell lines. These data are representative of more than 3 independent
experiments, each showing similar trends. B, the TLR1-TLR2 ligand Pam3CysK4 (2.5 mg/mL) was added to A375 cells for 48 hours. Cytokine and chemokine
production was determined using a Milliplex cytokine/chemokine array. C, IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor or vehicle alone (DMSO) was added to
melanoma cells for 48 hours. The level of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated p65 subunit of NF-kB was determined by Western blotting. D,
cytokine and chemokine levels in the supernatant A375 cell culture were examined using a Milliplex cytokine/chemokine array 48 hours after adding IRAK-1,
-4 inhibitor or DMSO. These data are representative of at least 3 experiments, each showing similar trends. ANOVA;   , P < 0.001;  , P < 0.05.

stimulation increased or induced p-IRAK-4 or p-IRAK-4
expression levels. Inexplicably, however, the TLR5 agonist
ﬂagellin reduced total and p-IRAK-4 levels in both cell lines.
This is the ﬁrst report showing the expression of constitutively phosphorylated IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 on human cutaneous melanoma cells. These data also represent a comprehensive protein expression proﬁle of TLRs and TLR-signaling
proteins on melanoma cells and highlight the differences in
the expression of these proteins in different melanoma lines. It
is worth noting however, that Western blotting was used to
detect total TLR proteins levels versus ﬂow cytometry, which
detects surface TLRs.
Cytokine/chemokine production by melanoma cells
following activation or inhibition of IRAK-1,-4
The stimulation of TLR-MyD88 or IL-1/18/33–MyD88 activates IRAK-1,-4 resulting in the expression of various chemokines and cytokines involved in cell survival and division as well

as factors capable of promoting tumor growth such as angiogenenic and inﬂammatory cytokines. We compared the cytokine/chemokine proﬁle between A375 cells stimulated with the
TLR1-TLR2 agonist Pam3CysK4 and untreated cells. TLR stimulation signiﬁcantly augmented the production levels of various factors including those associated with angiogenesis such
as VEGF, the melanoma growth factor chemokine ligand-1
(CXCL1), and IL-8, which promote cell survival and proliferation (Fig. 1B; P < 0.05; ANOVA; refs. 14–16). The levels of
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
and IP-10 were also increased following addition of the TLR1TLR2 agonist (Fig. 1B; P < 0.001; ANOVA). TLR1-TLR2 also
increased MCP-1 and IL-6 levels but appeared to reduce
fractalkine concentrations. To further conﬁrm that the TLRIRAK signaling pathway was intact in melanoma cells and that
changes in cytokines/chemokines are a result of activating this
pathway, we transiently overexpressed IRAK-1 in G361 melanoma cells and compared changes in cytokine/chemokine

levels with control G361 cells. Overexpressing IRAK-1
increased the levels of various cytokines/chemokines including
VEGF, CXCL1, G-CSF, and IL-12p40. IRAK-1 expression also
induced the expression of IP-10, G-CSF, and PDGF-AA but had
no effect on EGF production, as shown in Supplementary Fig.
S1. Collectively, these data indicate that melanoma cells
express a functional TLR-IRAK signaling pathway and that
the activation of this pathway might play a role in promoting
cell survival or proliferation in part through the production and
chemokines/cytokines.
On the basis that melanoma cells exhibited increased levels
of phosphorylated IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 and IRAK signaling
results in the activation of various transcription factors, we
examined the outcome of inhibiting IRAK signaling in melanoma cells. Melanoma cells cultured in the presence of an
IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor showed marked reduction of phosphorylated NF-kB (p-NF-kB) in all 4 melanoma cell lines tested as
compared with cells treated with vehicle alone (DMSO), Fig.
1C. Furthermore, IRAK-1,-4 inhibition reduced the production
of VEGF more than 90% and diminished CXCL1, monocyte
chemotactic protein-1 (MCP1), platelet-derived growth factor
alpha (PDGF-A), and ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF-2) levels in
A375 cells (Fig 1D, P < 0.05). The fact that that IRAK-1,-4
inhibition reduced the levels of these molecules in the absence
of exogenous TLR agonists, suggests that IRAK-1,-4 contributes
greatly to cell function through the production of various
factors. It is worth highlighting that the addition of IRAK-1,4 inhibitors also decreased the effects of TLR1-TLR2 agonist
(Supplementary Fig. S2), further conﬁrming that changes in
chemokines/cytokines occurred in a TLR-MyD88-IRAK
fashion.
Collectively, these ﬁndings support the contention that the
activation of IRAK-1,-4 signaling on melanoma cells in vivo
might contribute to cancer progression by inducing the expression of various chemokines and cytokines beneﬁcial to cancer
cell survival, division, and/or angiogenesis. Furthermore, the
inhibition of IRAK-1,-4 drastically reduced the production of
several cytokines/chemokines, highlighting the possibility that
IRAK-1,-4 signaling plays a central role in cytokine/chemokine
production even in absence of exogenous TLR agonists. However, these data do not exclude the possibility that TLRs
recognize endogenous TLR agonists or that other cytokines
produced in response to IRAK signaling might further potentiate this signaling pathway.
Combining IRAK inhibition with certain chemotherapies
augments melanoma cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo
Melanoma cells become resistant to a variety of chemotherapies by altering their survival signaling pathways
during cancer progression (17). Various studies have documented the prosurvival effects that TLR signaling have on
different cell types (13). Considering the impact that inhibiting
IRAK-1,-4 had on NF-kB activation and chemokine/cytokine
production, we examined whether IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor might
be used as a means to augment the toxic effects of certain
chemotherapies, which alone are not very effective. The melanoma cell lines A375 and Malme-3M were cultured in the
presence of IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor and various concentrations of

6212

Cancer Res; 72(23) December 1, 2012

vinblastine, 50 ﬂuorauracil, and cisplatin. The data in Fig. 2A
show increased sensitivity of both cell lines to vinblastine
(left panels). The addition of 50 -ﬂuorouracil and IRAK-1,-4
inhibitor also appeared to enhance the apoptosis of Malme3M cells but had no effect on A375 cells (Fig. 2A, middle
panels). IRAK-1,-4 inhibition did not increase cisplatin's
cytotoxicity of either cell line (Fig. 2A, right panels). We
examined in greater detail the role that IRAK had in mediating the chemoprotective effects. A375 cells engineered to
knockdown IRAK-1 expression were treated with vinblastine, and apoptosis was measured 48 hours later. psi-RNA
reduced IRAK protein levels more than 95%; a representative
image is shown in Fig. 2B. Reducing IRAK-1 or IRAK-4
expression levels augmented the toxic effects of vinblastine,
as compared with cells transfected with the control
plasmid, Fig. 2B (right panel). Cells coexpressing psi-RNAhIRAK-1 and -4 exhibited a higher percentage of death than
cells expressing either of these vectors alone, Fig. 2B (right
panel). It is worth noting that IRAK inhibitor alone or cells
expressing psiRNA-IRAK moderately increased melanoma
apoptosis (in the absence of vinblastine), suggesting that
IRAK signaling plays an important role in cell survival.
IRAK-1,-4 inhibition resulted in reduced levels of activated
NF-kB (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we examined whether IRAK–NFkB signaling is linked to chemoresistance by treating A375
melanoma cells with and without NF-kB inhibitor and in the
absence and presence of vinblastine. Interestingly, NF-kB
inhibition did not alter A3750 s sensitivity to vinblastine
(Supplementary Fig. S3A; P ¼ 0.14). Furthermore, because
the toxic effects of doxorubicin have been shown to involve
NF-kB signaling, we also examined the effects of inhibiting
NF-kB in A375 melanoma cells (18). In sharp contrast to the
combinatorial effects of NF-kB inhibition plus vinblastine,
NF-kB inhibition increased the toxic effects of doxorubicin
on A375, Supplementary Fig. S3A. These data suggest that
although TLR-IRAK signaling can activate NF-kB and inhibiting IRAK signaling can reduce p-NF-kB levels, the chemoprotective effects observed appear to be mediated via a
mechanism independent of NF-kB. Because IRAK signaling
results in the activation of various transcription factors
including c-jun/Fos, Elk-1, and cAMP-responsive element
binding protein (CREB), we postulate that perhaps IRAK
signaling is linked to chemoresistance via the activation of
one of these factors. The possibility that these transcription
factors could impart melanoma cells a prosurvival signal is
substantiated by several studies highlighting that these
transcription factors play a critical role in melanoma progression (19–22).
Alternatively, cytokines/chemokines produced in response
to TLR-IRAK signaling might also contribute to the chemoprotective effects observed. Therefore, supernatant from
TLR1-TLR2-stimulated or unstimulated A375 melanoma cells
was added to the C32 melanoma cells in the presence or
absence of vinblastine. Another group of cells were treated
with TLR1-TLR2 ligand and apoptosis was examined by ﬂow
cytometry. The Supplementary Fig. S3B show that supernatant
from TLR-stimulated A375 cells moderately reduced vinblastine-induced apoptosis as compared with untreated cells (P <

Furthermore, neither IL-1 or CXCL1 appeared to be the cytokines responsible for the observed chemoprotective effects,
Supplementary Fig. S3C. These data suggest that cytokines/
chemokines produced in response to TLR-IRAK stimulation
can contribute to cell survival; however, other IRAK-mediated
factors appear to play a more important role. It is also worth
noting that different melanoma cell lines might be more or less
responsive to factors produced in response to TLR-IRAK
stimulation based on the expression levels of different cytokine/chemokine receptors.
As an independent biochemical assay to conﬁrm that
A375 melanoma cells triggered apoptosis, we also conducted
Western blot analysis using antibodies speciﬁc for caspase-3
and PARP. Active caspase-3, which is cleaved to yield catalytically active subunits, was detected following the addition of 10 mmol/L IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor (Fig. 2C). Enhanced
accumulation of cleaved PARP, which is targeted for caspase-dependent proteolysis, was also observed in IRAK-1,-4
inhibitor-treated cells. Increased levels of cleaved PARP and
caspase-3 occurred in a concentration-dependent manner
(Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2D, the combination of vinblastine
and IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor also increased the levels of cleaved

without 2.5 mmol/L of IRAK-1,-4 and
in the presence or absence of
vinblastine for 48 hours. PARP and
caspase-3 levels were determined by
Western blotting.

IRAK-4 Signaling and Melanoma Progression

PARP and caspase-3. In contrast, treatment with vinblastine
or IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor alone had little effect on the levels of
these molecules.
We also sought to determine whether inhibitor-treated cells
exhibited changes in the levels of apoptosis-related molecules.
We compared the expression of various apoptosis-related
genes in A375 melanoma cell line treated with DMSO vehicle
(control), IRAK inhibitor, and vinblastine and observed a gene
proﬁle that favored apoptosis in the presence of inhibitor alone
or vinblastine (Supplementary Fig. S4). Taken together with
data presented in Fig. 2, these gene array data conﬁrm that
inhibiting the IRAK pathway in melanoma cells is important
for their survival and indicate that interfering with this pathway can sensitize melanoma cells or at lease function in
concert with certain chemotherapies to enhance their toxic
effects. These data also show that some chemotherapeutic
drugs, such as vinblastine, that have been deemed ineffective
might be rendered therapeutically useful when combined with
a TLR/IRAK inhibitor.
The antitumor effects of combinatorial therapy using vinblastine and IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor were tested in vivo. A375 cells
were subcutaneously injected into NSG mice and grown to 30
to 50 mm2. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with

Figure 3. Treatment with IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor enhances the therapeutic effects of vinblastine in mice with an established human melanoma tumor. NSG mice
2
(n ¼ 5) were injected subcutaneously with A375 melanoma cells. When tumors reached a size of approximately 50 mm , mice remained untreated or were
injected intraperitoneally with vinblastine (0.25 mg/kg; administered every 2 days for 10 days) or peritumorally with IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor (35 mg/kg) or with
vinblastine plus IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor. Tumor sizes were calculated by measuring perpendicular by longitudinal diameter.  , P < 0.05. Mouse survival data were

vinblastine or intratumorally with IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor (35
mg/kg) or with vinblastine or IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor alone. Mice
receiving IRAK-1,-4 inhibitors plus vinblastine showed a
marked reduction in tumor growth and improved mouse
survival (median survival: 38 days) as compared with mice
receiving vehicle (DMSO) plus vinblastine (median survival: 22
days) or mice receiving IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor (median survival: 19
days), Fig. 3A and B. Mice receiving single therapy for IRAK-1,-4
inhibitor or vinblastine showed modest tumor growth delay
but similar survival as compared with control mice (median
survival: 17 days). Despite a tumor growth delay, mice receiving
IRAK-1,-4 inhibitors plus vinblastine succumbed to tumor
challenge 40 days after initiation of treatment. Nonetheless,
these results emphasize the antitumor effects of combinatorial
therapy and highlight the need for further optimization. Identifying novel signaling pathways that can improve the efﬁcacy
of chemotherapeutic drugs to treat melanoma patients is
critical, considering that advanced melanoma is highly resistant to all known chemotherapies (17). The synergistic effects
of IRAK-1,-4 inhibitor and vinblastine may reside in the mechanism of action by vinblastine. Whereas, vinblastine kills cells
by suppressing microtubule dynamics, cisplatin and
50 ﬂuorouracil damage DNA by inducing DNA (and protein)
cross-linking, and by irreversibly inhibiting thymidylate
synthase, respectively. Ongoing studies by our group are
focused on identifying additional chemotherapeutic drugs that
are enhanced when used in combination with IRAK-1,-4
inhibitor.
Altogether, these ﬁndings corroborate a link between IRAK1,-4 signaling in melanoma cells and survival and suggest a
phenotype supportive of melanoma progression in cancer
patients. The importance of IRAK-1/IRAK-4 signaling and cell
survival is further highlighted in immune cells in which TLR
engagement enhances the expression of various antiapoptotic
genes (13).
Phosphorylated IRAK-4 in melanoma biopsies
Phosphorylated IRAK-4 expression was analyzed by IHC in
normal skin and in melanoma tissue derived from patients at

6214

various clinical stages. Although little staining was observed in
normal skin, p-IRAK-4 was highly expressed in melanoma
samples (representative staining are shown in Fig. 4A). We
sought to determine the association between p-IRAK-4 expression and the clinical stage. As shown in Fig. 4B, p-IRAK-4 levels
were not linked to melanoma stage nor was there a correlation
between p-IRAK-4 levels and metastasis. Unexpectedly, however, quantiﬁcation of the staining revealed 2 distinct groups in
melanoma samples in all clinical stages; one group of melanoma samples expressed p-IRAK-4 levels similar to those on
normal skin, and another group expressed signiﬁcantly higher
p-IRAK-4 levels (Fig. 4B; P < 0.005; ANOVA). Samples from stage
I through IV melanoma also showed a distinct division
between high and low/no expression of phosphorylated
IRAK-4 (Fig. 4B; P < 0.05; ANOVA). Of the 242 melanoma
samples analyzed, nearly half expressed elevated levels of pIRAK-4. It is worth noting that the elevated levels of p-IRAK-4 in
melanoma patients did not correlate with patient age or
gender (Fig. 4C).
Currently, there is no effective cure for patients with
advanced melanoma. This is due in large part to their high
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Ongoing studies by our
group are focused on identifying the association between total
and phosphorylated IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 expression levels with
clinical outcome including response to treatment and survival.
The immunohistochemical data presented here are in line with
the Western blotting data showing that a subset (42%; 3 of 7) of
melanoma cell lines express p-IRAK. Ongoing studies are
focused on determining the use of total and/or p-IRAK-1,-4
as biomarkers for prediction of therapy resistance and patient
survival. It is important to note that recent studies support our
contention that IRAK signaling contributes to cancer progression. Boukerche and colleagues found that IRAK-1 gene transcript levels in melanoma patients were associated with highly
metastatic melanoma individuals, whereas Li and colleagues
observed that reexpression of miR-146a in pancreatic cancer
lines downregulated IRAK-1 expression as well as NF-kB
activity that blocked pancreatic cancer cell invasiveness and
metastasis (23, 24).

The studies presented here highlight the possibility of
identifying new chemotherapeutic agents that might be
currently in use to treat other cancers or other disorders
but might be repurposed against melanoma when joined
with IRAK inhibitors. Although new drugs such as vemurafenib (BRAF enzyme inhibitor), ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4),
BMS-936558 (anti-PD1), and BMS-663513 (anti-CD137;
ref. 25) show antitumor activity, the effects are quite moderate, prolonging survival 2 to 6 months. In addition,
patients eventually develop a resistance to vemurafenib.
For this reason, Plexxikon and Roche are currently testing
vemurafenib in combination with other signaling pathway
inhibitors such as mitogen-activated protein inhibitors in an
attempt to prevent the development of tumor chemoresistance. Unfortunately, no other therapies to date have proven
effective at improving overall survival of these patients
(3, 26, 27), and the development of new therapeutic agents
has not kept up with the increased melanoma incidence
(28). We propose that understanding how IRAK inhibition
sensitizes melanoma to chemotherapies (or augments their
toxic effect) might provide novel insights and allow the
