ABSTRACT
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
erlotinib has been approved based on the clinical benefit in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients over the past decade. Unfortunately, cancer cells become resistant
to this agent via various mechanisms, and this limits the improvement in patient
outcomes. Thus, it is urgent to develop novel agents to overcome erlotinib resistance.
Here, we propose a novel strategy to overcome acquired erlotinib resistance in NSCLC
by inhibiting glutaminase activity. Compound 968, an inhibitor of the glutaminase
C (GAC), when combined with erlotinib potently inhibited the cell proliferation of
erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells HCC827ER and NCI-H1975. The combination of
compound 968 and erlotinib not only decreased GAC and EGFR protein expression
but also inhibited GAC activity in HCC827ER cells. The growth of erlotinib-resistant
cells was glutamine-dependent as proved by GAC gene knocked down and rescue
experiment. More importantly, compound 968 combined with erlotinib down-regulated
the glutamine and glycolysis metabolism in erlotinib-resistant cells. Taken together,
our study provides a valuable approach to overcome acquired erlotinib resistance by
blocking glutamine metabolism and suggests that combination of EGFR-TKI and GAC
inhibitor maybe a potential treatment strategy for acquired erlotinib-resistant NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations [8– 10]. However,
almost all tumors acquire resistance to EGFR-TKIs after
varying periods of treatment time [11, 12]. Although the
occurrence of genetic alterations such as T790M second
mutation, MET amplification, hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF) overexpression have been implicated [13–16], the
precise mechanisms responsible for the acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKIs still not well understood.
Malignant tumor cells exhibit considerably
different metabolic requirements involved in glycolysis
and glutamine metabolism compared to adjacent normal
cells [17–19]. The earliest and best-known cancer
metabolic anomaly is Warburg effect characterized by
increased glycolysis and lactate production regardless of
oxygen availability [20]. Therefore, targeting the peculiar
metabolic pathways in cancer might be an effective
strategy for cancer therapy. Recently, it was reported that
enhanced glutamine metabolism as well as the expression
of GLS occurred in both patients and cell lines resistant to
EGFR-TKIs [21, 22]. Therefore, inhibition of glutamine
metabolism may be a potential strategy against NSCLC.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide, accounting for nearly 1.4–1.6 million
deaths in each year [1–3]. In 2014, the overall estimation
of 224,210 new cases is diagnosed, and 159,260 cases
are estimated to finally die of lung cancer, accounting
for 27.2% of all the cancer-related death in the United
States [4]. In many countries, the mortality related to lung
cancer continues to rise. The two main classification of
lung cancer based on tumor histology are small cell lung
carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) [5]. Non-small cell lung cancer, which mainly
includes squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma,
and adenocarcinoma, accounts for nearly 85% of all cases
of lung cancer [6].
Approximately 20% lung cancer patients occupy
EGFR mutations that promote cancer cell growth [7].
This makes EGFR an important therapeutic target for the
treatment of NSCLC. EGFR-TKIs, such as gefitinib and
erlotinib, were reported to have therapeutic effects against

Glutamine is the most abundant and versatile
nutrient that plays a vital role in multiple metabolic
processes and signaling in human cells. For glutamine
metabolism, GLS is the key enzyme in the conversion of
glutamine to glutamate and is expressed in many tissue
cells and cancer cells [23–25]. GLS has two isoforms in
human cells: GLS1 (known as kidney glutaminase) and
GLS2 (known as liver glutaminase). GLS1 is a phosphateactivated enzyme with two major splice variants: a long
form (KGA) and a short form (GAC) [26]. It was reported
that GAC knocking-down resulted in more cell growth
reduction than KGA knocking-down in several lung
cancer cell lines indicating that GAC is the more essential
GLS1 splice variant in NSCLC [27].
In our pervious study, we found a novel GAC inhibitor,
named 968 (5-(3-bromo-4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-2,2dimethyl-2,3,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[α]- phenanthridin-4(1H)one). It blocked breast cancer cell proliferation, migration,
invasion and the growth of tumors in mouse xenograft model
but no inhibitory effects on normal cells [28]. Therefore,
in the present study, we try to explore whether compound
968 can overcome the resistance to erlotinib in NSCLC by
blocking glutamine metabolism, and to identify the effects
of combined therapy of compound 968 and erlotinib on
NSCLC.

HCC827 and HCC827ER cells, we detected cell growth
in the medium with or without glutamine. HCC827 and
HCC827ER cells were incubated in glutamine free RPMI
1640 medium, and cell numbers were counted from 1 to
6 days. The cell number of HCC827 decreased from
approximately 100% on day 1 to 18% on day 6 (Figure 2A,
***P < 0.001), and the similar results were observed for
HCC827ER cells. These results indicate that the growth of
both cells has great dependency on glutamine.
To further confirm the glutamine-dependency for both
cell lines, we knocked down GAC by siRNAs in HCC827
and HCC827ER cells, and performed cell proliferation
assays. As shown in Figure 2B and 2C, knocking down
GAC by siRNA1 and siRNA2 significantly suppressed cell
growth for both HCC827 (Figure 2B, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01)
and HCC827ER (Figure 2C, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001)
on day 4 and 6. The expressions of GAC was showed in
Figure 2D. To further prove the important role of GAC played
in the regulation of acquired resistance, we knocked down
GAC, and then transfected GAC plasmid into the cells for a
rescue experiment. The rescue efficiency in HCC827ER was
much higher than that in HCC827 cells (Figure 2E and 2F).
All these results indicate that the growth of HCC827
and HCC827ER cells is glutamine dependent, and GAC
plays a central role in regulating cell proliferation in
erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cells.

RESULTS

Combination of compound 968 and erlotinib has
synergized inhibitory effects on the growth of
HCC827ER cells

The effects of erlotinib on human NSCLCHCC827 and HCC827ER cells
Human NSCLC cell lines HCC827 (EGFR exon
19 deletion [delE746-A750]) and erlotinib-resistant
HCC827ER cells harboring MET gene amplification
were used in this study. We first confirmed the resistance
of HCC827ER cells to erlotinib. As shown in Figure 1A,
the growth of HCC827ER cells was not inhibited by
erlotinib even at the concentration up to 2 μmol/L.
However, HCC827 cells were unable to grow under these
conditions, only 10% of parental HCC827 cells survived
after exposure to 10 nmol/L erlotinib (***P < 0.001).
To investigate the anchorage independent growth
of malignant cells, the soft agar assay was performed. For
HCC827ER cells, they formed big colonies whether treated
with or without 1 μM erlotinib. However, for HCC827 cells,
they formed colonies, but colonies disappeared after treatment
with 1 μM erlotinib (**P < 0.01, Figure 1B and 1C). These
results further confirm that HCC827ER cells were resistant
to erlotinib.

Glutaminolysis and glutaminase (GLS) have been
showed to be indispensable for cancer development and
progression. Glutaminase C (GAC), a splice variant
of kidney-type glutaminase, has been demonstrated to
be the major form of GLS in tumor cells [22, 24]. In
our previous study, we found a novel GAC inhibitorcompound 968 and proved that compound 968 had a
potent inhibitory effect on the growth of breast cancer
cells [23]. In present study, we already proved that the
growth of HCC827 and HCC827ER cells is dependent on
glutamine. We were wondering whether compound 968
had effects on the growth of HCC827 and HCC827ER
cells. As shown in Figure 3A, compound 968 treatment
at different concentrations significantly inhibited the cell
growth of both HCC827 and HCC827ER cells (*P < 0.05,
**P < 0.01) in saturation density assay. There was no
significant difference statistically between HCC827 and
HCC827ER cells for the inhibitory effects of compound
968, suggesting that compound 968 suppressed NSCLC
cell proliferation through a pathway distinguished from
erlotinib.
The effects of compound 968 combined with
erlotinib on the growth of HCC827 and HCC827ER cells
were further investigated by cell growth assay. The cell
numbers for both HCC827 and HCC827ER cells decreased

by 20% comparing with the control cells when treated
with compound 968 for 48 hours. However, the growth
of HCC827ER cells was inhibited potently when treated
with the combination of compound 968 and erlotinib
(Figure 3B, ***P < 0.001) indicating that compound 968
not only overcomes acquired erlotinib resistance but also
restore sensitivity of HCC827ER cells to erlotinib.
To further investigate the mode of action for
compound 968 combined with erlotinib on the growth of
HCC827ER cells, we did cell growth assay by changing
the concentration of one regent with the concentration of
another one fixed. As shown in Figure 3C, HCC827ER
cells were treated with increasing concentrations of
compound 968 (5, 10, 20, and 40 μM) combined with
1 μM erlotinib for 48 hours. The cell growth decreased
in a compound 968 dose dependent manner, and the cell
number was reduced by 72% compared to untreated
control cells at the concentration of 40 μM (Figure 3C,
*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). However, when HCC827ER cells
were treated with increasing concentrations of erlotinib
(0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 μM) combined with 10 μM compound
968, the growth of HCC827ER cells did not decrease in an
erlotinib dose dependent manner (*P < 0.05).

Time-course experiments were also performed.
HCC827ER cells were treated with erlotinib, compound
968, or compound 968 combined with erlotinib for 0, 12,
24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours respectively. Treatment with
either erlotinib (1 μM) or compound 968 (10 μM) alone
slightly or modestly suppressed the growth of HCC827ER
cells. However, the combination of compound 968 (10 μM)
and erlotinib (1 μM) potently inhibited the growth of
HCC827ER cells in a time-dependent manner (Figure 3D).
The cell numbers for combined group decreased from 100%
to 38% compared to the control group (***P < 0.001).
In order to test whether compound 968 sensitized
cancer cells to other anticancer drugs except erlotinib,
gefitinib (the first selective inhibitor of EGFR) and cispatin
(the first member of a class of platinum-containing anticancer drugs) were used for the evaluation. As shown in the
Figure S1, compound 968 sensitized cancer cells to gefitinib
at a high concentration, and the sensitization efficiency was
lower than that to erlotinib. Furthermore, compound 968
had a weak effect on the cell sensitization to cispatin.
These findings suggest that compound 968 plays
critical role in reversing acquired erlotinib and Gefitinib
resistance for HCC827ER cells.

Combination of compound 968 and erlotinib also
decreases the growth of other NSCLC cell lines

(Figure 4B). Furthermore, compound 968 showed much
stronger inhibitory effect on NCI-H1975 than A549 cells.
The effects of erlotinib combined with compound
968 on the three NSCLC cell lines were also investigate.
As shown in Figure 4C, NCI-H1650, NCI-H1975 and
A549 cells were treated with increasing concentrations
of compound 968 (5, 10, and 20 μM) combined with
1 μM erlotinib for 48 hours. The growth of NCI-H1975
cells decreased in a compound 968 dose dependent
manner, and the cell number was decreased by 70%
compared to untreated control cells at the concentration
of 20 μM (Figure 4C, ***P < 0.001). The growth of
A549 cells decreased moderately at the concentration of
20 μM. However, the growth of NCI-H1650 cells did not
decrease significantly. When those cell lines were treated
with increasing concentrations of erlotinib (0.01, 0.1, 1.0,
and 2.0 μM) combined with 10 μM compound 968, the

To investigate whether similar phenomenon can be
observed for other human NSCLC cell lines, three new
cell lines (A549, NCI-H1975, and NCI-H1650) were used
for cell proliferation assay. Among them, A549 cells were
EGFR wild type, NCI-H1975 and NCI-H1650 cells were
EGFR mutants with the same kinase domain mutation
(L858R and ΔE746-A750). They also have additional
changes such as T790M in NCI-H1975 and PTEN loss in
NCI-H1650 [30, 31]. Erlotinib did not inhibit significantly
the growth of all these cell lines even at the concentration
of 2 μM indicating that all these cell lines were insensitive
to erlotinib (Figure 4A). However, compound 968
suppressed the cell proliferation of A549 and NCI-H1975
cells but had no effects on the growth of NCI-H1650 cells

such condition.
T790M mutation in EGFR is detectable in
approximately 50% of patients with NSCLC who relapse
after an initial response to TKIs. It is regarded as a marker
for acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Our results suggest
that compound 968 combined with erlotinib can overcome
the acquired resistance to erlotinib in NSCLC especially
with EGFR (T790M) mutation.

the expressions of EGFR and GAC in both HCC827
and HCC827ER cells with compound 968 treatment.
Compound 968 decreased the expression of EGFR and
GAC in HCC827 cells in a dose- and a time-dependent
manner (Figure 5A). Intriguingly, although the expression
of GAC was inhibited by compound 968 in HCC827ER,
the EGFR expression in HCC827ER cells was not
decreased by compound 968 treatment even at the highest
concentration (10 μM) and with longest treatment time
(48 h) (Figure 5B). We further evaluated the effects of
compound 968 combined with erlotinib on EGFR and
GAC expressions in both HCC827 and HCC827ER
cells. The expression level of EGFR in HCC827 cells
(Figure 5C, left panel) was higher than that in HCC827ER

of GAC was reversed. Although the expression of EGFR

Combination of compound 968 and erlotinib
decreases glutamine and glycolysis metabolism
in HCC827ER cells

by compound 968 or erlotinib treatment alone, it was
inhibited obviously by the combination of compound 968
and erlotinib (Figure 5C, right panel). This combination
also decreased the expression level of GAC in HCC827ER
cells. Statistical analysis of band intensities was showed
in Figure S2.
To understand the molecular mechanism that
compound 968 reverses acquired erlotinib resistance in
HCC827ER cells, we tested the enzyme activity of GAC
in human NSCLC cells (Figure 5D). The GAC activity in
HCC827ER cells was slightly higher than that in HCC827
cells. Compound 968 treatment alone decreased the GAC
activity of HCC827ER cells by about 40% compared with
untreated cells, however, combination of compound 968 and
erlotinib inhibited the GAC activity by approximately 70%
compared with untreated cell (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
All these results indicate that the combinatorial treatment
potently reverses the acquired erlotinib resistance by
suppressing the expressions of EGFR and GAC, and further
GAC activity.

To explore the metabolomic profiles of erlotinibresistant NSCLC cells and understand the metabolic
adaptation of the cells, we performed 1H 1D NMR
experiments to analyze metabolites changes in these
cells. Results from metabolic profiling of HCC827 and
HCC827ER cells identified the metabolites responsible
for the different phenotypes between HCC827 and
HCC827ER cells (Figure 6). The glutamine and glycolysis
metabolism were significantly up-regulated in HCC827ER
cells compared to HCC827 cells. The concentration of
metabolites including glutamine (Figure 6A, **P < 0.01),
glutamate (Figure 6B, *P < 0.05), glucose (Figure 6C,

of the landmark targets for NSCLC therapy. However,
almost all the patients with initial dramatic responses to
gefitinib or erlotinib ultimately become resistant to them
mostly within 6–12 months, which has been defined as
“acquired resistance” [12]. Thus, there is an urgent need
to develop effective strategies to overcome the resistance.
In the present study, we explored a new way to
overcome acquired erlotinib resistance in NSCLC by
inhibiting the glutamine metabolism. The enhanced
glutamine metabolism in cancer cells has already been
exploited for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Because of this,
the enzyme GLS has become a key target for small molecule
therapeutic intervention in recent years [35]. Several
glutaminase inhibitors were designed and synthesized for
targeting glutamine metabolism in cancer therapy. However,
because toxicity, side-effects, they still have not used in
cancer treatment [34–36]. In our previous work, when we
studied Rho GTPases regulated cellular transformation,
we found a novel glutaminase inhibitor-compound 968, it
inhibited potently the growth of breast cancer cell, however,
no effects on the growth and morphology of normal human
mammary epithelial cells and 3T3 cells [23]. To check
whether compound 968 has side effects on lung cell lines,
we used primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells to
do experiments described in Supplementary methods. The
results demonstrated that compound 968 did not influence

for cell metabolism (Figure 6E, ***P < 0.001), and the
concentration of ATP decreased greatly from 29.8 μM to
4.1 μM (**P < 0.01) when HCC827ER cells were treated
with compound 968 combined with erlotinib. Total 64
metabolites detected by 1H NMR analysis were presented
in Table S1. A simple pathway map of metabolites from
glycolysis and glutamine metabolism was showed in
Figure 6F. These results indicate clearly that the glycolysis
and glutamine metabolism are enhanced in HCC827ER
cells compared with HCC827 cells. Taken together, we can
conclude that compound 968 reverses acquired erlotinib
resistance in non-small cell lung cancer by inhibiting not
only glutamine metabolism but also glycolysis.

DISCUSSION
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a kind of
tyrosine kinase receptors, plays a critical role in regulating
multiple cellular processes, including proliferation,
survival and apoptosis. It is a member of the HER family,
which also includes HER2 (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3),
HER4 (ErbB4) [32, 33]. The constitutive activation of
EGFR signaling pathway, caused by gene mutations or by
gene amplification or both, has been demonstrated to have
close connection with the initiation, progression and poor
prognosis of NSCLC [34]. Therefore, EGFR becomes one

the cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle of HBE cells
even at the concentration of 40 μM (Figure S3), suggesting
that compound 968 also has low or no toxic effects on
normal lung cells.
Recently, researchers found that glutamine uptake
and GAC expression is markedly enhanced not only
in NSCLC cells sensitive to erlotinib, but also in cells
resistant to erlotinib [21, 22]. Similar results were
observed in our study, we found that GAC expression was
much higher in HCC827ER cells than that in HCC827
cells. We also found that compound 968 inhibited the cell
growth of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC cell line HCC827ER,
suggesting compound 968 re-sensitized HCC827ER
cells to erlotinib in vitro. To figure out the molecular
mechanism for compound 968 re-sensitizing HCC827ER
cells to erlotinib, we checked EGFR expression levels for
different treatments. Although erlotinib or compound 968
treatment alone had no or weak effect on the expression
of EGFR, the combination of compound 968 and erlotinib
decreased the expression of EGFR obviously. This can
explain why combination of compound 968 and erlotinib
has synergized inhibitory effects on the growth of
HCC827ER cells because they inhibited not only GAC
but also EGFR.
Mutations that substitute methionine for threonine at
position 790 (T790M) in the EGFR kinase domain seems
to occur in approximately 50% of lung adenocarcinomas

from patients with acquired resistance to the EGFRTKIs [13, 36, 37]. Therefore, the T790M mutation in
EGFR is regarded as a marker for acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKIs. Another mechanism by which patients
develop acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitor occurs
via the amplification of the MET oncogene [38, 13].
Approximately 5–20% of the NSCLC patients undergo
amplification of the MET after long period under the
EGFR-TKI treatment [39]. In 2010, Kenichi Suda et al
reported that HCG827ER, a cell line with acquired
resistance to erlotinib derived from HCC827, had
MET amplification without EGFR T790M mutation
[40]. Therefore, targeting T790M mutant and MET
amplification may be a potential strategy to overcome
acquired resistance of EGFR-TKIs. In our experiments,
several typical human NSCLC cell lines associated with
EGFR mutant were used to investigate the cell growth
inhibition by compound 968 and erlotinib. Compound
968 combined with erlotinib significantly decreased
cell proliferation of HCC827ER cells harboring MET
amplification and NCI-H1975 cells with T790M mutant.
It also moderately suppressed the growth of A549 cells
with EGFR wild type. However, the combination of
compound 968 and erlotinib did not block the cell
proliferation of NCI-H1650 cells with PTEN mutant.
These results indicate that the combination of compound
968 and erlotinib can reverse acquired erlotinib resistance

in NSCLC with EGFR (T790M) mutant and MET
amplification. This combination should be a promising
therapeutic strategy for treatment of acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC.
The metabolic characteristics of cancer cells
were distinguished from that of normal cells, and the
identification of metabolic profiles relevant to erlotinibresistant HCC827ER cells was helpful to understand
the metabolic adaptation of the cells. The glutamine and
glycolysis metabolism was enhanced in HCC827ER
cells compared to that in HCC827 cells, which was
consistent with previous reports [21]. It was interesting
that compound 968 combined with erlotinib suppressed
not only glutamine metabolism, but also glycolysis. These
results indicate that the combination of compound 968 and
erlotinib inhibits the growth of erlotinib-resistant NSCLC
cells by suppressing whole cellular metabolism, not just
glutamine pathway alone.
All these results indicate that both EGFR and GAC
play crucial roles in regulating cancer cell function.
Treatment with EGFR inhibitors, such as erlotinib and
gefitinib, may cause several types of side effects, including
skin rash, acute lung disease, and diarrhea [44, 45]. The
combination of an EGFR-TKI and a GAC inhibitor may
optimize both antitumor efficacy and safety, and provide
a new therapeutic strategy for the EGFR-TKI resistant
NSCLC.

HCC827ER cells were developed by chronic exposure
HCC827 cells to erlotinib at increasing concentrations as
described previously [40]. Wild type (A549) and mutated
[NCI-H1975 (L858R, T790M), NCI-H1650 (phosphatase
and tensin homologue loss)] EGFR-expressing cell lines
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI- 1640
medium, supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C in a
humidified 5% CO2 incubator.

Cell proliferation assay
HCC827, HCC827ER, NCI-H1975, NCI-H1650,
and A549 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a
density of 2,000 cells per well in 0.5 ml of media. For
erlotinib resistance assay, cells were treated with series
of concentrations of erlotinib (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and
2 μM). For erlotinib and compound 968 combination
assay, cells were treated with compound 968, or erlotinib,
or compound 968 combined with erlotinib, respectively.
After 48 h incubation, cells were fixed in 10% formalin
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Dye was extracted
with 10% acetic acid and the relative proliferation was
determined at 595 nm.

Soft agar assay
HCC827 and HCC827ER cells were trypsinized
and counted, 1 × 104 cells were resuspended in 0.3%
agar medium containing 10% FBS with erlotinib (1 μM)
or DMSO. The mixture was plated on top of a solidified
layer of RPMI-1640 supplemented with 0.5% agarose and
10% FBS. Cells were fed weekly by adding 1 ml of 0.3%
agar medium containing 10% FBS with erlotinib (1 μM)
or DMSO. After 2 weeks, colonies larger than 50 μm were
scored and the cell growth in soft agar was calculated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
Compound 968 was purchased from Calbiochem
(Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Erlotinib
hydrochloride was obtained from Biovision Inc.
Compound 968, erlotinib, gefitinib, and cisplatin
were dissolved in DMSO, and used at the indicated
concentrations. Antibodies against β-actin and secondary
antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA, USA). Mouse monoclonal EGFR antibody
was obtained from Becton, Dickinson and Company.
Rabbit polyclonal GAC antibody was made in a company.
RPMI 1640 Medium (with 300 mg/L L-Glutamine) and
Advanced RPMI 1640 Medium (without L-Glutamine)
were purchased from GIBICO (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Crystal violet and other analytical grade chemicals were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Growth in glutamine free medium
HCC827 and HCC827ER cells were seeded into
12- well culture plates (1 × 105 cells per well) and allowed
to adhere to the wells overnight. Media were changed
with advanced RPMI 1640 medium without L-Glutamine
(300 mg/L). Cells were cultured from day 1 to day 6, and
the cell growth was determined by cell proliferation assay.

Knockdown and transfection
For knockdown experiments, the cells were
seeded the day before siRNA transfection to reach 50%
confluency at the time of transfection. Three distinct
Stealth siRNAs of GAC (Invitrogen, Cat.HSS104192;
HSS104193; HSS178458) were used as described previous
[28]. A nonspecific oligonucleotide was used as a negative
control and the knockdown efficiency was determined by
Western blot. Cell proliferation after GAC knockdown was

determined by crystal violet staining at day 2, 4, and 6. For
plasmid-based transfections, cells transfected with GAC
siRNA for 24 h were seeded the day before to reach 80%
confluency at the day of transfection. Then, cells were
transfected with 2 μg pCDNA 3.1-V5-GLS [28]. The
rescue efficiency was determined by Western blot and cell
proliferation was determined by crystal violet staining at
day 2, 4, and 6.

Metabolomic profiles were obtained to assess the
relative distribution of various cellular metabolites of
HCC827 and HCC827ER cells. Cells were collected and
quickly frozen. Further sample preparation, metabolic
profiling, peak identification and curation were performed
by Anachro Technologies Inc. (Wuhan, China) using their
described methods [48, 49]. All NMR experiments were
carried out on an Agilent DD2 600 MHz spectrometer
(1H resonance frequency) equipped with a triple-resonance
cryoprobe. Identification of the metabolites in the cells
was carried out from the 1D NMR data using the software
Chenomx NMR Suite 8.0 (Chenomx Inc., Edmonton,
Canada).

Saturation density assay
Saturation density assay was conducted as
previously described [46]. Briefly, cells with 70% to 80%
confluence were trypsinized and plated into 12-well culture
plates (1 × 105 cells per well) in 1 mL of media. Cells were
allowed to adhere to the wells overnight and then counted
(day 0). Media were changed every 2 days by fresh media
containing compound 968(0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μM). Cells
were counted at the 6 days by a hemocytometer.

Statistical analysis
Results are represented by mean ± S.D. Metabolite
concentrations were exported from the Chenomx software
and prinicipal component analysis (PCA) was conducted
on all data sets initially to evaluate overall patterns and
check for outliers. Statistical significance was tested
by one-way ANOVA, with P-value of less than 0.05
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were conducted using GraphPad Prism 5.0.

Glutaminase activity assay
Glutaminase activity was determined as previously
described [28, 47] with some modification. Isolated
mitochondria were incubated with 57 mM Tris-acetate
(pH 8.6) and 0.225 mM EDTA by rotating at 37°C, in
a final volume of 110 μL and a final concentration of
17 mM. The reaction proceeded for 1 hr and stopped by
adding 10 μL of ice-cold 3M hydrogen chloride (HCl).
An aliquot of the quenched reaction mixture (10 μL)
was added to an incubation containing 114 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 9.4), 0.35 mM adenosine diphosphate (ADP), 1.7 mM
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), and 6.3 U/ml
glutamate dehydrogenase to give a final volume of 446 ml.
The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature
for 45 min. The absorbance of each sample was read at a
wavelength of 340 nm and the glutaminase activity was
calculated.
