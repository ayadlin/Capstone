ABSTRACT
Inactivating mutations in ARID1A are found in a broad spectrum of cancer types,
with the highest frequency in gynecologic cancers. However, therapeutic strategies
targeting ARID1A-mutant cancer cells remain limited. In this study, we aimed to
identify drugs sensitivities in ARID1A-mutant cancer cell lines. By analyzing the
Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, we found that ARID1A-mutant
cancer cell lines were more sensitive to treatment with the reactive oxygen species
(ROS)-inducing agent elesclomol. In a panel of 14 gynecologic cancer cell lines,
treatment with elesclomol inhibited growth and induced apoptosis more potently
in ARID1A-mutant cells. Knockdown of ARID1A in RMG1 and OVCA432 ovarian
cancer cells resulted in increased sensitivity to elesclomol, whereas restoration of
ARID1A expression in TOV21G ovarian cancer cells resulted in increased resistance
to elesclomol. Furthermore, we found that knockdown of ARID1A expression resulted
in increased intracellular ROS levels. In ovarian clear cell carcinoma patient samples,
low expression of ARID1A correlated with high expression of 8-hydroxyguanosine, a
marker for oxidative stress. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that loss
of ARID1A leads to accumulation of ROS and suggest that elesclomol may be used to
target ARID1A-mutant gynecologic cancer cells.

deficiency leads to sensitization to several inhibitors [10,
11, 13], therapeutic strategies that target ARID1A-mutant
cancers remain limited.
Compared with normal cells, cancer cells have
higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species
(ROS) due to aberrant metabolic activity, oncogene
activation, and the tumor microenvironment [14–17].
Although a moderate increase in ROS level can promote
cell proliferation and survival [18–21], high ROS levels
lead to activation of senescence and cell death [22–25].
To prevent intracellular levels of ROS from reaching
toxic levels, cancer cells are dependent on an up-regulated
antioxidant system and sensitive to further increases in
ROS levels [14–16]. Several studies have demonstrated

INTRODUCTION
Subunits of SWI/SNF are frequently inactivated
in a variety of cancer types [1, 2]. In particular, AT-rich
interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) is
the most frequently mutated SWI/SNF subunit in cancer
[2], with the highest mutation frequency in gynecologic
cancers, i.e. ovarian clear cell carcinomas, ovarian
endometrioid carcinomas, and endometrial endometrioid
carcinomas [3–7]. Recent studies demonstrated that
ARID1A has tumor suppressive functions, such as
regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, p53
activity, the PI3K pathway, EZH2 targets, and DNA repair
[8–13]. Although it has been demonstrated that ARID1A

that treatment with agents that increase ROS can inhibit
growth and induce apoptosis in cancer cells [26–29].
However, what predicts the sensitivity of cancer cells to
ROS-inducing agents is not completely clear.
Previous studies demonstrated that SWI/SNF is
required for oxidative stress resistance in different model
organisms. In Caenorhabditis elegans, SWI/SNF is a cofactor for DAF-16 and required for DAF-16 functions,
including longevity and resistance to oxidative stress [30].
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a genetic screen revealed
that deletion of several SWI/SNF subunits resulted in
increased sensitivity to oxidative stress [31]. Given
that SWI/SNF is evolutionary conserved across several
species, it is possible that SWI/SNF is also required for
oxidative stress resistance in mammalian cells.
In this study, we sought to determine whether loss
of ARID1A expression leads to increased sensitivity to
a particular drug. We analyzed the Genomics of Drug
Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database [32] and found that
ARID1A-mutant cancer cell lines were more sensitive to
the ROS-inducing agent elesclomol than were ARID1Awildtype cancer cell lines. Using gynecologic cancer cells,
we validated that ARID1A deficiency led to increased
sensitivity to treatment with elesclomol. Subsequently, we
found that loss of ARID1A was associated with increased
oxidative stress in vitro and in ovarian clear cell carcinoma
patient samples. Taken together, our findings suggest that
ARID1A protects cells against oxidative stress and ROSinducing agents may be used to target ARID1A-mutant
gynecologic cancer cells.

The majority of drugs that exhibited significant
differences (P < 0.05) in sensitivity between ARID1Amutant and ARID1A-wildtype cancer cell lines were
enriched in 1) inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway
(AZD8055, NVP-BEZ235, MK-2206, and GDC-0941) or 2)
agents that induce DNA damage or inhibit the DNA damage
response (cisplatin, KU-55933, and NU-7441) (Table 1). We
noted that these enrichments are consistent with previously
published data that ARID1A deficiency resulted in increased
sensitivity to PI3K/AKT inhibitors [10] and agents that
induce DNA double-strand breaks [12, 13].
Interestingly, we found that elesclomol, which
potently induces ROS formation by disrupting the electron
transport chain in the mitochondria [34], exhibited the
greatest difference in sensitivity between the ARID1Amutant and ARID1A-wildtype cancer cell lines (Table 1).
As it has not been demonstrated that ARID1A is required
to protect cells against oxidative stress in mammalian cells,
we decided to focus on elesclomol for further validation.

Elesclomol inhibits growth and induces apoptosis
more potently in ARID1A-mutant than ARID1Awildtype ovarian cancer lines
To validate the findings from the GDSC database,
we examined a panel of 14 ovarian and endometrial cancer
cell lines. We first determined ARID1A mutation statuses
in these cell lines using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
database [33], DNA sequencing, and western blot analysis
(Table 2 and Figure 1a). We found that the ARID1A-mutant
cancer cell lines had significantly lower IC50s of elesclomol
than did the ARID1A-wildtype cancer cell lines (P = 0.034)
(Figures 1b and 1c). Interestingly, we noted that ARID1Awildtype COV362 cells were very sensitive to treatment
with elesclomol, which may be due to harboring a truncating
mutation in BRCA1. A previous study has demonstrated that
loss of BRCA1 results in increased ROS accumulation and
sensitivity to oxidative stress in breast cancer cells [35].
Treatment with elesclomol at 10 and 20 nM also induced
apoptosis more potently in ARID1A-mutant cancer cells
than in ARID1A-wildtype cancer cells (P = 0.0227 and
P = 0.0057, respectively) (Figure 1d). We confirmed that
elesclomol exerted its effects through increasing ROS as
addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could
abrogate the effects of elesclomol (Figure 2). Taken together,
these results demonstrated that ARID1A-mutant cancer cell
lines are more sensitive to treatment with elesclomol.

RESULTS
ARID1A-mutant cancer cell lines are more
sensitive than ARID1A-wildtype cancer cell
lines to treatment with the ROS-inducing agent
elesclomol
To identify drug targets for ARID1A-mutant cancer
cells, we analyzed the publicly available GDSC drug
database [32] and compared the drug sensitivities of
ARID1A-mutant and ARID1A-wildtype cancer cell lines.
The GDSC database contains drug responses of more than
700 cancer cell lines of different cancer types to about 140
drugs. First, we determined the ARID1A mutation statuses
of all the cancer cell lines using the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia database [33]. We excluded cell lines with
no mutation or copy number alteration data from further
analysis. We placed the remaining cell lines into ARID1Awildtype (no detectable ARID1A mutations, n = 347) and
ARID1A-mutant (ARID1A nonsense mutations, frameshift
mutations, or deep deletions, n = 74) groups. We also
excluded cell lines with ARID1A missense mutations,
in-frame insertions/deletions, or splicing mutations from
further analysis because the effect of these mutations on
ARID1A protein expression and function is unclear.

OVCA432 ovarian cancer cells resulted in increased
sensitivity to elesclomol (Figure 3a). Although RMG1
cells were intrinsically highly resistant to treatment with
elesclomol, depletion of ARID1A sensitized the cells
to elesclomol in the micro-molar range (Figure 3a). In

addition, we found that knockdown of the SWI/SNF
core subunits BRG1 and SNF5 also resulted in increased
sensitivity to elesclomol in RMG1 cells (Figure 3b). Downregulation of ARID1A, BRG1, and SNF5 expression by
siRNA were confirmed by western blot (Figure 3c).

To show that this effect was not limited to elesclomol,
we also examined the sensitivity of these cells to treatment
with another ROS-inducing agent, piperlongumine [27]. We
found that ARID1A depletion in RMG1 cells also led to
sensitization of the cells to piperlongumine (Supplementary
Figure S1a and S1b). Similar to elesclomol, we found that
piperlongumine inhibited growth by increasing ROS as
treatment with NAC reversed the anti-proliferative effects
of the drug (Supplementary Figure S1c).

in TOV21G cells after transfection with the pCI-neoARID1A vector (Figure 4c).

Depletion of ARID1A leads to increased
intracellular ROS level and cell proliferation
Next, we asked that whether ARID1A affects
intracellular ROS levels. We found that depletion of
ARID1A resulted in an increase in intracellular ROS
levels in RMG1 and OVCA432 cells by measuring
2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA) fluorescence
(Figure 5a). We asked if the increase in intracellular ROS
affects cell growth in ARID1A-knockdown cells. Upon
ARID1A depletion, cell growth in RMG1 and OVCA432
cells was increased by 23% and 90% respectively
(Figure 5b). Addition of NAC was able to fully inhibit
the increase in cell growth upon ARID1A depletion in
RMG1 cells and partially in OVCA432 cells (Figure 5b).
These data suggests that up-regulation of ROS has growth
promoting effects upon ARID1A depletion.

Re-expression of ARID1A increases the
resistance of ovarian cancer cells to treatment
with elesclomol
To complement the siRNA experiments, we
transiently re-expressed ARID1A in ARID1A-mutant
TOV21G ovarian cancer cells and found that ARID1A
re-expression resulted in increased resistance of the cells
to treatment with elesclomol (Figure 4a and 4b). Western
blot analysis confirmed that ARID1A was re-expressed

Ovarian clear cell carcinoma patient samples
with low expression of ARID1A display higher
levels of oxidative stress

in cancer [8–13], whether ARID1A regulates ROS has not
been reported. In the present study, we demonstrate for the
first time that loss of ARID1A leads to accumulation of
ROS in gynecologic cancer cells. Consistent with our in
vitro findings, we found that ovarian clear cell carcinoma
patient samples with low ARID1A expression exhibited
increased oxidative stress. We also found that the increase
in ROS is fully required for growth promotion upon
ARID1A depletion in RMG1 and partially required in
OVCA432 cells. An increase in ROS levels can activate
signaling pathways, transcription factors, and growth
promotion [18–21, 36, 37], however, excessive ROS can
cause oxidative damage to macromolecules and cell death
[26, 38]. Therefore, we propose a model in which ARID1A
loss leads to an increase in ROS that promotes cell growth,
but renders the cells vulnerable to further oxidative stress.
Further studies will be required to identify ROS-regulating
genes that are affected by loss of ARID1A.
In our study, we also found that depletion of the SWI/
SNF core subunits BRG1 and SNF5 also led to increased
sensitivity to elesclomol in RMG1 cells, suggesting that

To demonstrate the biological significance of
our in vitro findings, we examined the expression of
8-hydroxyguanosine (8OHdG) as a marker of oxidative
stress in ovarian clear cell carcinoma patient samples.
Representative images are shown in Figure 6. We found
that samples with lower expression of ARID1A (Figure 6,
samples 5-8) were associated with higher expression of
8OHdG compared to samples with higher expression
of ARID1A (Figure 6, samples 1-4). Together with our
in vitro data, these results show that loss of ARID1A is
associated with increased oxidative stress.

DISCUSSION
ROS has important roles in tumor development and
progression [10, 14–16]. Although it has been demonstrated
that ARID1A has important tumor suppressive functions

other subunits of SWI/SNF are required for protection
against oxidative stress. Previous studies also support this
notion. In the Supplementary Data of the study of Du et al.,
knockdown of BRG1 led to increased sensitivity to H2O2
in lymphoblasts [39]. In C. elegans, SWSN-1, SWSN-3,
and SWSN-8 (orthologs of human BAF155/170, BAF57,
and ARID1A respectively) are co-factors of DAF-16 and

required for DAF-16 mediated oxidative stress resistance
[30]. A genetic screen in S. cerevisiae found that deletion
of SNF2 (ortholog of human BRG1), SNF5, SNF6, and
SWI3 (ortholog of human BAF155/170) resulted in
increased sensitivity to oxidative stress [31]. As SWI/SNF
subunits other than ARID1A are also frequently inactivated
in cancer [1, 2], cancer cells with SWI/SNF mutations may

be more sensitive to oxidative stress and ROS-inducing
agents may be used to target these cancers.
Interestingly, previous studies have found that
antioxidant activity is up-regulated in ovarian clear cell
carcinomas. HNF1β, which is highly expressed in ovarian
clear cell carcinomas, was found to reduce intracellular
ROS levels and enhance oxidative stress resistance [40].
In addition, the NRF2 antioxidant pathway is activated in
ovarian clear cell carcinomas, possibly due to mutations
in the NRF2 negative regulator KEAP1 [41]. It is possible
that up-regulation of the antioxidant system is required to
combat the increase in ROS caused by loss of ARID1A. As
up-regulation of antioxidant activity is associated with poor
survival and resistance to chemotherapy [41–44], therefore,
further understanding in how ARID1A regulates ROS levels
and its possible co-operation with antioxidant pathways will
be clinically relevant.

In summary, we found that loss of ARID1A leads to
higher levels of ROS and sensitivity to the ROS-inducing
agent elesclomol. Our study suggests a novel therapeutic
strategy for ARID1A-mutant gynecologic cancer cells by
inducing oxidative stress.

The drug sensitivities of cancer cell lines were
downloaded from the GDSC database (release 4, March
2013) [32]. Mutation statuses and copy numbers of
ARID1A in cancer cell lines were obtained from the
Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database using the
56939

cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (www.cbioportal.
org) [33]. Cell lines with no mutation or copy number
alteration data were excluded from further analysis. Based
on ARID1A mutational status, cell lines were placed into
ARID1A-wildtype (no detectable ARID1A mutations, n =
347) or ARID1A-mutant (ARID1A nonsense mutations,
frameshift mutations, or deep deletions, n = 74) groups.
In addition, cells lines with missense mutations, in-frame
insertions/deletions, or splicing mutations in ARID1A were
excluded from further analysis because the effect of these
mutations ARID1A expression and function are unclear.
To detect differences in drug sensitivity between
ARID1A-mutant and ARID1A-wildtype cell lines, permutation
tests were performed using the marker selection function of
the GENE-E matrix visualization and analysis platform (www.
broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/). For each drug,
a test statistic was calculated to assess the difference in drug
response between ARID1A-mutant and ARID1A-wildtype
cell lines. Next, the significance of the test statistic score was
estimated in 1000 permutations. Multiple hypothesis testing
was corrected by computing both the false discovery rate
and the family-wise error rate. A two-tailed t-test was used to
calculate significance. A negative t-test score plus a significant
P-value suggested that ARID1A-mutant cancer cell lines were
more sensitive to the corresponding drug than ARID1Awildtype cancer cell lines.

lines were maintained for 20-30 passages.

PCR amplification of ARID1A
Genomic DNA was harvested from cells using the
PureLink Genomic DNA mini kit (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
The sequences of PCR primers and PCR cycling conditions
used to amplify exons 1-20 of ARID1A were previously
described [4]. PCR was performed in 50 μL reactions
containing MyTaq Red Mix (Bioline, Taunton, MA, USA),
1.5 μM of forward primer, 1.5 μM of reverse primer, 6%
DMSO and 20 ng of DNA. PCR reactions were purified
using the PureLink PCR purification kit (Life Technologies).
Purified PCR products were sent to the MD Anderson
Sequencing and Microarray Core for Sanger sequencing.

Western blot analysis
Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and
scraped on ice in ice-cold RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein lysates were
collected after centrifuging the cells at 13,000 rpm for
10 min at 4 °C. For each sample, 25 μg of protein was
loaded onto a SDS-PAGE gel. After transferring the
protein to a nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane
was incubated with primary antibodies against ARID1A
(Sigma-Aldrich), BRG1 (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA), SNF5 (Cell Signaling Technology),
and vinculin (Cell Signaling Technology). Then, the
membrane was incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology). The bands on the membrane were visualized
using enhanced chemiluminescence plus western blotting
reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK).

each sample, at least 20,000 cells were analyzed using a
Gallios Flow Cytometer and the cells were gated to include
live and single cells only. The Kaluza Anlaysis Software was
used to analyze the mean fluorescence.

Cells were treated with the indicated drugs for 72 h
and collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 4
°C. The cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and resuspended
in annexin binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl,
2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4; Life Technologies). For each sample,
1 × 105 cells were stained in 100 μL of annexin binding buffer
with 5 μL of annexin V-APC (BD Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA, USA) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Prior
to analysis, 400 μL of annexin binding buffer and 100 ng/
mL propidium iodide (BD pharmingen) were added to each
sample. For each sample, at least 10,000 cells were analyzed
using a Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea,
CA, USA). Cells were gated to include single cells only. Data
analysis was performed using the Kaluza Analysis software
(version 1.3, Beckman Coulter). The annexin V-positive cells
included both annexin V/PI double-positive and annexin
V-positive/PI-negative cell populations.

Immunohistochemistry staining
Paraffin-embedded sections from patients with
ovarian clear cell carcinomas were obtained from
the archives of the Department of Pathology at The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. All
cases were reviewed and confirmed as ovarian clear cell
carcinomas by a gynecologic pathologist (J.S.C.). All
tissue specimens were collected and archived previously
under protocols approved by the institutional review
board. Immunohistochemistry staining of the sections
was performed as previously described [46]. Slides were
stained with anti-8OHdG (1:200, EMD Millipore) and
anti-ARID1A antibodies (1:100, Sigma-Aldrich).

siRNA transfection

Statistical analysis

Cells were transfected with 20 nM siGENOME
SMARTpool ARID1A, SNF5, and BRG1 siRNAs
(Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) and Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Control cells were transfected with
siGENOME non-targeting siRNA pool #2 (Dharmacon).
For cell growth assays, cells were transfected for 24 h and
then treated with the indicated drugs for 72 h.

Values are presented as the means and error bars
represented the standard deviation. Unless otherwise
stated, P-values were determined using the Student t-test.
P-values of <0.05 were considered significant.

Re-expression of ARID1A
The pCI-neo-ARID1A vector was a gift from Dr.
Weidong Wang (National Institutes of Health) and has
been described previously [45]. Due to several nonsynonymous mutations in the ARID1A open reading frame
in the original vector, mutagenesis was carried out in the
Custom Cloning Core at Emory University to restore the
ARID1A open reading frame to the wild-type sequence.
Cells were plated in a 6-well plate and transfected with
2 μg of pCI-neo-ARID1A vector and Lipofectamine
3000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Control cells were transfected with empty
pCI-neo vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells
were trypsinized and re-plated for subsequent experiments.
