BACKGROUND. Hypomethylating agents have activity in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and have received approval for the treatment of both MDS and
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The specific efficacy in CMML has
not been detailed in a large number of patients. The aim of the study was to
evaluate the activity and safety of decitabine in CMML.

METHODS. Nineteen adults with a diagnosis of CMML treated on decitabine studies were analyzed. Decitabine was given at 100 mg/m2 per course every 4 weeks.
The median number of courses given was 9 (range, 1–18).

RESULTS. Overall, 11 patients (58%) achieved complete response (CR) and 2
(11%) had hematologic improvement (HI), for an overall response rate of 69%
according to the modified International Working Group (IWG) criteria. Median
survival was 19 months. Severe (grade 3–4) extramedullary side effects were rare.

CONCLUSIONS. Decitabine is active in CMML. Studies of combinations of decitabine with topoisomerase I inhibitors or other active anti-CMML agents are indicated. Cancer 2007;109:713–7.  2007 American Cancer Society.

hronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a hybrid disorder
characterized by proliferation of the myeloid series and dysplasia of the erythroid-megakaryocytic series.1 CMML is now categorized as a separate entity from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).2 It
is often considered as an overlap between MDS and myeloproliferative disorders, and can be divided into low- and high-grade subtypes, based essentially on the percent of marrow blasts and the
degree of anemia and thrombocytopenia.1 CMML affects older individuals (median age, 60–65 years), predominantly men. Presenting
features include fatigue and anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and bleeding, and splenomegaly. The median survival in CMML
is 18 to 20 months. Commonly used approaches to treat CMML
include supportive care, growth factors, hydroxyurea, topotecan and
cytarabine or intensive acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-type therapies, splenectomy (refractory splenomegaly and hypersplenism/
cytopenias), and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).3–5 The
only approved therapies for CMML are 5-azacitidine and decitabine,
the approval by the US Food and Drug Administration being part of
the blanket approval for MDS, rather than an expanded specific
study in CMML. The approval was for MDS based on the FrenchAmerican-British (FAB) classification, which included CMML. CMML
is now considered separate by the World Health Organization (WHO)
classification.2 Fewer than 10 patients with CMML were treated in
each of the 2 pivotal studies.6,7

Prior therapy for CMML

Secondary CMML

CMML indicates chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
* One patient had a splenectomy prior to decitabine therapy.

A subset (1%–2%) of patients with MDS or CMML
have chromosomal abnormalities involving translocations between chromosome 5q33 and other chromosomes, eg, t(5;12)(q33;p12-13). They respond well to
imatinib mesylate therapy, which has been recently
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
this uncommon disorder.
In this analysis, we review our experience with
decitabine therapy in CMML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
Adults with a diagnosis of CMML treated on decitabine studies were analyzed. Informed consent was
obtained according to institutional guidelines. Eligibility criteria required an age 16 years old, adequate performance status of 0 to 2 (ECOG scale), and
adequate liver (bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL) and renal functions (creatinine 1.5 mg/dL). Patients were required
not to have received more than 1 prior regimen or biological therapy, prior high doses of cytarabine (1 g/m2
daily), or chemotherapy for at least 2 weeks before
receiving decitabine, and to have recovered from
the side effects of prior therapy. Nursing females were
excluded and patients of child-bearing potential were
required to practice effective birth control measures.

IWG indicates International Working Group; CR, complete response.

The diagnosis of CMML included patients with confirmed morphologic disease with monocytosis of 8% or
more in the blood and marrow, as well as an absolute
monocyte count of 109/L or above, regardless of the
white blood cell (WBC) cutoff of 12 3 109/L.3–5,8
Patients received decitabine in a Bayesian randomized design detailed elsewhere,9 in 1 of 3 schedules:
1) 20 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) over 1 hour daily 3 5;
2) 20 mg/m2 daily 3 5, given in 2 subcutaneous (s.c.)
doses daily; or 3) 10 mg/m2 i.v. over 1 hour daily 3 10.
All patients received the same decitabine total dose
per course, 100 mg/m2. The final results and outcomes by schedule were previously detailed.9 Courses
of decitabine were given every 4 weeks, at least in the
first 3 courses, regardless of the counts, as long as
there were no significant myelosuppressive life-threatening complications with a particular course, such as
pneumonia, severe infection or bleeding, or severe
organ damage; and there was evidence of persistent
disease. Timely and repeated courses of decitabine
every 4 weeks (rather than 6–8 weeks as in previous
studies) for a minimum of at least 3 courses was important for the decitabine dose-schedule delivery.
No dose escalations were considered. Dose reductions by 25% to 30%, rounded to 15, 10, 7.5,
and 5 mg/m2, were allowed for grade 3–4 nonmyelosuppressive toxicities, for severe myelosuppressionassociated complications (infections, bleeding), or for
prolonged myelosuppression defined as a hypocellular marrow (5% or less cellularity) without evidence
of disease for 6 weeks or more after the start of a
course of therapy. Other dose modifications, eg, 50%
dose reductions, were occasionally considered for
severe complications, if judged in the best safety interest of the patient. Use of erythropoietin and GCSF were allowed as indicated by the clinical condition. Antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy for fever of
infections was according to institutional guidelines.9
Patient responses were evaluated by the new proposed International Working Group (IWG) criteria.10

drug-related myelosuppression, infections, or other
factors known to cause myelosuppression did not
interrupt evaluation of response duration. Response
criteria of the IWG for complete response (CR) and
partial response (PR) were similar to the ones used
for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but required
response durability for at least 4 weeks and improvement of hemoglobin to 11 g/dL or above. A CR
required normalization of the bone marrow and
peripheral counts with 5% or less marrow blasts, a
granulocyte count 109/L or above, hemoglobin level
11 g/dL or above, and a platelet count 100 3 109/L or
above, lasting for at least 4 weeks. A PR was similar to
CR except for persistent marrow blasts above 5%, but
which were reduced by 50% or more. A marrow CR
referred to reduction of marrow blasts to 5% or less
without normalization of peripheral counts. In addition, a CR required disappearance of palpable splenomegaly if present and a PR required reduction of
palpable splenomegaly by at least 50%. A complete
cytogenetic response referred to disappearance of the
cytogenetic abnormality; partial cytogenetic response
referred to 50% or more reduction of the cytogenetic
abnormality.10
Hematologic improvements (HIs) were coded by
the IWG criteria: HI-E referred to a hemoglobin
increase by at least 1.5 g/dL or transfusion independence; HI-P referred to an absolute increase of platelet
counts from less than 20 to more than 20 3 109/L

and by at least 100%, or if more than 20 3 109/L, by an
absolute increase of at least 30 3 109/L; HI-N referred to a
granulocyte increase by at least 100% and by an absolute
increase of at least 0.5 3 109/L. HIs were required to
last for at least 8 weeks. Persistence of dysplastic
changes in CR were allowed.
Survival was dated from the start of therapy. Survival curve was according to the Kaplan-Meier method.

RESULTS
A total of 19 patients with CMML were treated from
February, 2004, to October, 2005. Their median age
was 66 years (range, 44–82 years); 5 (26%) patients
were females. The characteristics of the study group
are detailed in Table 1. Splenomegaly was present in
22%, anemia in 53%, thrombocytopenia in 63%, and
chromosomal abnormalities in 31%. Secondary MDS
was present in 16% of patients (Table 1). The number of patients treated on each schedule was: 1) i.v.
daily 3 5, 16 patients; 2) s.c. daily 3 5, 1 patient; 3)
i.v. daily 3 10, 2 patients.
Overall, 11 patients achieved CR (58%), and 2
(11%) had hematologic improvement (1 HI erythroid þ platelet, 1 HI platelet), for an overall
response rate of 68%. Splenomegaly was reduced by
more than 50% in 3 of the 4 patients with initial palpable splenomegaly (1 CR, 2 HIs). The response data
are detailed in Tables 2 and 3. The CR rate by sched-

daily 3 5, 0 CR/1 ¼ 0%; 3) i.v. daily 3 10, 1 CR/
2 ¼ 50%. In the overall study evaluation the i.v. daily
3 5 schedule was selected as the one associated with
the highest CR rate, as detailed in a previous report.9
The median number of courses given was 9 (range,
1–18). The median number of courses to achieve CR was
3 (range, 1–6). The 2-year survival rate was 48% (Fig. 1).

Side Effects
Nonhematologic side effects were minimal (Table 4).
Myelosuppression-associated complications occurred
in 8% of courses. Drug-related myelosuppression requiring dose reductions was noted in 17% of courses.
There were no deaths associated with adverse events.

DISCUSSION
Studies of the efficacy of novel therapies for CMML
are scarce. Most such studies combine MDS with
CMML, and very few evaluate the benefits of such
regimens selectively in CMML. Whereas decitabine
and 5-azacitidine have received approval for the
treatment of CMML, very few patients with CMML
had in fact been treated with either agent.6,7 This is
the first study to report on a relatively sizable number of patients with CMML treated with a specific
therapy, decitabine in this case.
In this study decitabine showed positive activity
in CMML. The response rate with decitabine was
68% (CR rate 58%). Nonhematologic side effects were
minimal and myelosuppression-associated complications acceptable. There were no drug-related mortalities. Seventeen (89%) patients received at least 3
courses. Thus, the profiles of efficacy and side effects

of decitabine appear favorable and suggest the need
to pursue the activity of decitabine in CMML, a disease with few treatment options.
Topotecan, and other topoisomerase I inhibitors,
have demonstrated activity in MDS and CMML.3,11
As a single agent, topotecan induced complete remissions in 28% of patients with CMML.3 These
results were with a continuous administration schedule of topotecan. In a Phase I study of oral topotecan
for patients with MDS, CMML, or AML, responses
were observed in 42% of patients, including CR in
17%.12 Future studies may consider combining decitabine and topotecan for the treatment of CMML.
The criteria for initiation of therapy in CMML are
not clearly defined and are often based on the patient
symptoms, involvement of organs by CMML (eg, skin
disease, renal dysfunction, leukostasis), and the physician’s experience. In general, therapy is initiated for: 1)
increased signs or symptoms of CMML such as fever,
weight loss, symptomatic splenomegaly, hyperleukocytosis; 2) worsening cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytopenia, need for transfusions); 3) CMML organ involvement
(skin, renal dysfunction, pulmonary symptoms); or 4)
increasing blasts (usually to more than 5% to 10%).
Allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) is the only
curative modality for CMML but is risky. A search for
a donor should be initiated at the time of diagnosis of
CMML. The timing of allogeneic SCT is based on
patient age, donor source (related vs unrelated) and

degree of matching, and expected prognosis. It should
be performed under optimal conditions of minimal
CMML disease (possibly optimized safely with preSCT use of hypomethylation strategies) and when the
patient is still in a good health status (good performance status and organ functions, no infections).
In summary, decitabine has shown encouraging
activity in the specific subset of CMML, and should
be further investigated in combination therapies.
