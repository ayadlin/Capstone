BACKGROUND: A study was undertaken to investigate the detection of relapse and survival outcomes in patients
with cervical cancer treated with curative intent chemoradiotherapy, and evaluated with a post-therapy 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan. METHODS: Between January 2002 and June 2007,
105 consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled into a registry study designed to assess outcomes of chemoradiotherapy. A FDG-PET scan was performed between 3 and 12 months (median, 4.9 months) post-treatment at clinician discretion. Tumor response was graded as complete metabolic response, partial metabolic response, or
progressive metabolic disease. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 36 months. At post-therapy FDG-PET, 73 (70%)
patients had complete metabolic response, 10 (9%) had partial metabolic response, and 22 (21%) had progressive
metabolic disease. Overall survival at 3 years was 77% in all patients, and 95% for those with complete metabolic
response. On multivariate analysis, complete metabolic response (P < .0001) and pretreatment tumor volume (P ¼
.041) were strong predictors for overall survival. The number of involved lymph nodes (P < .005) and International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (P ¼ .04) were predictive of relapse-free survival. In total, 18 patients
relapsed at a single site, and 13 underwent salvage, with a 3-year survival of 67%. Patients with complete metabolic
response had a distant failure rate 36-fold less than those with partial metabolic response (P < .0001). After complete
metabolic response, only 1 patient (1.6%) relapsed without symptoms and was detected through physical examination. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a complete metabolic response at post-therapy FDG-PET is a powerful predictor for survival after chemoradiation. The very low rate of recurrence in patients with a complete metabolic response
justifies a conservative follow-up approach for these patients, because relapse is usually symptomatic and not

Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer diagnosed in women worldwide, and is the fifth most common
cancer overall.1 It accounts for approximately 150,000 deaths annually.2 Surgery is the primary treatment modality of
early stage disease, but many women present with locally advanced disease and are optimally treated with combination
chemoradiotherapy.3 Despite the burden of disease, there is no clear consensus among clinicians as to the optimal posttreatment surveillance.4 In a recent review of the literature,5 only 2 studies were identified that demonstrated a survival
benefit as a result of post-treatment surveillance of patients with cervical cancers, both of which were retrospective.6,7 Current follow-up practices include serial physical examinations with pelvic examinations, often in addition to cervical cytology (Papanicolaou test). However, routine surveillance with cervical cytology in these women has not been shown to be
helpful for detecting recurrent disease.8 It has been observed that 59% of patients treated for gynecological cancer report
increased anxiety before their hospital review,9 which may be attributable in part to the pelvic examination.

Original Article

Our institution has previously reported a 5-year
local control rate of 87% after curative intent chemoradiotherapy for patients with cervical cancer.10 Only 4% of
patients had an isolated local failure at the time
of their first relapse. We hypothesized that in the era of
post-therapy 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
tomography (FDG-PET) scanning, of those patients who
achieved a complete metabolic response, very few would
recur with a local first site of recurrence. We predicted
that in those patients who achieved a complete metabolic
response, the clinical utility of pelvic examinations would
be low. If our hypothesis is robust, it follows that a complete metabolic response may obviate the need for invasive
serial pelvic examinations conducted in the hospital clinic
setting. This study was designed to investigate the patterns
of failure, survival, and salvage outcomes after curative
chemoradiation of cervical cancer in relation to a single
surveillance FDG-PET scan performed between 3 and
12 months post-therapy. The primary objective was to
test the hypothesis that the asymptomatic relapse rate at
5 years (detected by clinical examination) would be less
than the arbitrary value of 5%, a rate we considered clinically significant. Secondary objectives were to characterize
pretreatment prognostic factors, patterns of failure (local,
nodal, and distant), cause-specific survival, and overall
survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
An independent human ethics board ratified this research.
Informed consent was obtained in all patients. One hundred five consecutive patients from January 2002 to June
2007 were enrolled into a prospective tumor registry
designed to assess outcomes to curative intent chemoradiotherapy. Patient characteristics (Table 1), staging,
treatment, toxicities, and follow-up details were prospectively recorded. As the optimal timing of post-therapy surveillance FDG-PET was unknown, a single post-therapy
FDG-PET scan was performed between 3 and 12 months
at clinician discretion. Irradiation techniques have been
previously described.11 During the study period, external
beam radiotherapy was delivered to the pelvis to a dose of
40 grays (Gy) in 2 Gy fractions or 45 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions. If pelvic nodes were involved, then nodes were
boosted to a total dose of 50 to 50.4 Gy. Concurrent
weekly cisplatin chemotherapy to a dose of 40 mg/m2 was
administered during the external beam component of
radiotherapy. Within 10 days of completion, a high-dose
rate intracavitary brachytherapy boost was delivered twice

weekly to a dose of 28 Gy in 4 fractions (or equivalent, to
a total tumor dose of 80 Gy). All radiotherapy was completed within 7 weeks.
All patients had histologically confirmed carcinoma
of the uterine cervix, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage Ib to IVa, and Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status 2 or less. Staging included pelvic examination under
anesthesia, whole body FDG-PET/computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis, and
routine blood counts.
FDG-PET scans were performed using GE Discovery LS and GE Discovery STE dedicated PET/CT scanners with 4- and 8-slice multidetector CT, respectively
(GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wis). Patients fasted
for at least 6 hours before intravenous injection of 370
MBq of fluorodeoxyglucose F-18. After the patient rested
supine for 60 minutes, a PET/CT scan was acquired.
Patients were routinely catheterized, hydrated, and diuresed. Metabolic changes post-therapy was scored as either
complete metabolic response, partial metabolic response,
or progressive metabolic disease.12
Clinical follow-up of patients including thorough
medical history and physical examination was performed

at 4 weeks post-therapy; every 3 months until 2 years
post-therapy; every 6 months in years 3, 4, and 5; then
yearly thereafter.
Statistical Methods
Times to events were measured from the date of the posttherapy PET. The asymptomatic relapse-free survival was
characterized using the (nonparametric) Kaplan-Meier
product limit method. The null hypothesis of a true
asymptomatic relapse proportion of 0.05 was tested
against the 2-sided alternative, and a P value for this
hypothesis was calculated.
The association between metabolic response on posttherapy FDG-PET and each of several failure types (local,
nodal, and distant) were tested using Cox proportional
hazards models, using post-treatment metabolic response as
a 3-level ordinal explanatory variable with values of complete metabolic response, partial metabolic response, or progressive metabolic disease. Likelihood ratio and Wald tests
were used to test the significance of the association.
To characterize potential prognosticators for survival,
a multifactor Cox proportional hazards model was built
with overall survival as the response event. FIGO stage,
tumor volume, number of pretreatment involved nodes,
and the presence of complete metabolic response at posttreatment FDG-PET were used as candidate explanatory
variables. Nonsignificant explanatory variables were eliminated from the model using stepwise backward elimination
with a significance level of .05. The model was repeated to
test for an association with relapse-free survival. To reduce
bias, post-therapy metabolic response was excluded, as this
variable was not independent of relapse. In the model for
relapse-free survival, times to events were measured from
the start date of radiotherapy. A noncancer-related death
was considered a censoring event for cause-specific survival.
The Kaplan-Meier product limit method was used to characterize the cause-specific survival and overall survival rates,
and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all
patients, for the subsets of patients who achieved and those
who did not achieve a complete metabolic response, and for
those patients who had a single site of recurrence and subsequently underwent salvage based on the results of the posttherapy FDG-PET. Log-rank tests using chi-square statistic
on 1 degree of freedom were used to test for equivalence.

RESULTS
The median time between the end of radiotherapy and
the patient’s post-therapy PET scan was 4.9 months. The

PET was performed between 1 and 3 months in 23
patients, between 4 and 6 months in 53 patients, between
7 and 9 months in 26 patients, and between 10 and 12
months in 3 patients (Fig. 1). The median follow-up of
living patients was 3.0 years (range, 0.8-6 years). At the
close-out date of February 2009, 78 patients were alive,
25 patients were dead, and 2 were lost to follow-up. At the
time of post-therapy FDG-PET, 73 (70%) patients had a
complete metabolic response, 10 (9%) patients had a partial metabolic response, and 22 (21%) patients had progressive metabolic disease. A summary of findings at posttherapy FDG-PET is found in Table 2.
Rate of Asymptomatic Recurrences
Of the 73 patients with a complete metabolic response at
post-therapy FDG-PET, 6 patients relapsed. The 5-year
relapse rate for patients with a complete metabolic response
was 0.097 (95% CI, 0.02-0.168). There was only 1 asymptomatic relapse detected by physical examination among the
patients with a complete metabolic response. This patient
relapsed at the primary site 1.65 years after the post-therapy
PET. The estimated asymptomatic relapse rate at 5 years is
0.016 (95% CI, 0-0.046), significantly less than the nominated threshold rate of 0.05 (P < .03).
Patterns of Failure
At the time of the post-therapy FDG-PET, there were 96
patients who had no distant disease. Of these 96 patients,

10 went on to have distant failures. There was strong evidence of an association between post-therapy metabolic
response and distant failure rate (P < .0001). Patients
with a partial metabolic response had a hazard rate for distant failure 36 times (95% CI, 7-191) the hazard rate of
patients with a complete metabolic response (P < .0001).
On multifactor Cox proportional hazards model analysis,
the pretreatment number of involved nodes (P < .005)
and FIGO stage (P ¼ .04) were both associated with
relapse-free survival, whereas tumor volume was not.
Patients with involved nodes had a 2.53-fold increase in
risk of relapse per unit of time over patients without nodal
involvement (95% CI, 1.32-4.86). On average, each additional positive lymph node increased the risk of relapse by
a factor of 1.29 (95% CI, 1.17-1.42).
Five (7%) of 73 patients with a complete metabolic
response and 1 (25%) of 4 patients with a partial metabolic response subsequently had a nodal relapse. There
was evidence of an association between post-therapy metabolic response and nodal failure rate (P ¼ .024). Patients
with a partial metabolic response had a hazard rate for
nodal failure that was 51 times (95% CI, 3-846) the rate
of patients with a complete metabolic response (P ¼
.0061). On multifactor Cox proportional hazards model
analysis, complete metabolic response at post-therapy
FDG-PET and pretreatment tumor volume remained significant variables after the process of eliminating nonsignificant variables.
Survival Outcomes

The overall survival rates for all patients at 3 years
and 5 years were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.69-0.86) was 0.69
(95% CI, 0.57-0.82), respectively (Fig. 2). The cause-specific survival rates for all patients at 3 years and 5 years
were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.73-0.90) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.600.85), respectively (Fig. 3). There was a large survival dif-

ference noted between patients who achieved complete
metabolic response at post-therapy FDG-PET and those
who did not (see Figs. 4 and 5). For patients with a complete metabolic response, the 3-year and 5-year overall
survival rates were 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89-1) and 0.91 (95%
CI, 0.82-1), respectively, and the 3-year and 5-year causespecific survival rates were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.93-1) and
0.93 (95% CI, 0.85-1). In contrast, patients without a
complete metabolic response had a 3-year overall survival
rate of 0.36 (95% CI, 0.21-0.60) and 3-year cause-specific
survival rate of 0.40 (95% CI, 0.24-0.66) (Figs. 4 and 5).
Achieving a complete metabolic response at posttherapy FDG-PET was a strong independent prognostic

factor for overall survival. Patients with complete metabolic response had a hazard rate 30-fold (95% CI, 9-105)
less that of those patients without a complete metabolic
response (P < .0001). Tumor volume was associated with
overall survival (P ¼ .046). Every 10-mL increase in tumor volume was associated with a 4% increase in rate of
death. Forty-three (41.0%) patients had involved lymph
nodes before treatment. Neither the pretreatment number
of involved nodes nor FIGO stage was found to have an
association with overall survival (P ¼ .47 and P ¼ .27
before elimination from the model). However, both the
pretreatment number of involved nodes and FIGO stage
were associated with relapse-free survival (P < .005 and
P ¼ .04, respectively). Patients with positive nodes had
risk for relapse 2.53-fold (95% CI, 1.32-4.86) higher
than lymph node-negative patients, with each additional
positive lymph node increasing this risk by a factor of
1.29 (95% CI, 1.17-1.42).
Salvage Outcomes
Eighteen of the 32 patients who did not achieve a complete metabolic response had a single site of failure (local,
nodal, or distant) at the post-therapy FDG-PET (Table
2). The estimated cause-specific survival rates at 1 and 2
years for this subset were 77% and 45%. Ten of these

response, 2 recurrences were symptomatic, and 1 was
asymptomatic. In total, the 13 patients undergoing salvage therapy had 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates of
89% and 67%, respectively, at a median follow-up of 1.6
years (range, 0.1-3.6 years). Eleven patients received salvage chemoradiotherapy for isolated nodal recurrences,
and 2 patients received salvage surgery for isolated pelvic
recurrences. Of the 3 patients who had an initial complete
metabolic response and subsequently had an isolated failure amenable to salvage, 2 of the patients were successfully
salvaged without further evidence of disease, including the
patient who relapsed asymptomatically.

DISCUSSION
Our institution has previously reported a strong correlation with metabolic response and prognosis after chemoradiation in a variety of cancer sites, including nonsmall
cell lung cancer,12 head and neck cancer,13 esophageal
cancer,14 and rectal cancer.15 FDG-PET has been
reported to be a powerful and highly sensitive imaging
modality in the detection of primary and recurrent cervical cancer.16 In the post-therapy setting in cervical cancer,
metabolic response on surveillance FDG-PET has been
shown to prognosticate survival.17-19 Grigsby et al.20
reported a retrospective cohort of 152 women in which
metabolic response at 3-month post-therapy FDG-PET
was the most significant independent predictor of survival
(P < .01). Women with no metabolic activity at the posttherapy FDG-PET had a 5-year cause-specific survival of
80% and a 5-year overall survival of 92%. Our series
reports similar results, with a 5-year cause-specific survival
of 98% and a 5-year overall survival of 91% in patients
with a complete metabolic response. Patients without a
complete metabolic response fared vastly worse (P <
.0001); corresponding 3-year cause-specific and 3-year
overall survival were 40% and 36%, respectively.
Our patterns of failure analysis also revealed that
metabolic response was strongly associated with outcomes. There was evidence of strong association between
post-therapy metabolic response with nodal failure rate
(P ¼ .024) and distant failure rate (P < .0001). Patients
with a partial metabolic response had a relative risk of
nodal failure 51 times that of patients with a complete
metabolic response (P ¼ .0061). Patients without a complete metabolic response at post-therapy FDG-PET were
36-fold more likely to develop metastatic disease (P <
.0001) than those who did not have a complete metabolic
response. When considering overall survival, the presence

3986

of a post-therapy complete metabolic response (P <
.0001) and pretreatment tumor volume (P ¼ .046) were
favorable and unfavorable prognostic variables, respectively, whereas FIGO stage and number of involved nodes
were not prognostic (P ¼ .27 and P ¼ .47, respectively).
Similar to our previously reported cohort,10 FIGO stage
and nodal involvement were strongly associated with
relapse-free survival (P ¼ .04 and P < .005). With respect
to overall survival, it may be that the inclusion of the
powerful prognostic factor of post-therapy metabolic
response may have masked any association of the expected
prognostic variables of FIGO stage and nodal
involvement.
After curative treatment, only a small proportion of
patients have a single site of failure suitable for salvage
therapy. The majority of patients (70%) treated at our
institution during this period achieved a complete metabolic response. Of the 32 (30%) patients who did not
achieve a complete metabolic response, 9 underwent salvage chemoradiotherapy, 1 underwent salvage pelvic
exenteration, and 22 were managed with palliative intent
(Table 2). Pelvic examination did not add incremental
benefit above FDG-PET; palpable disease was detected in
3 patients, all of whom had had multiple sites of metabolic
disease not amenable to salvage. Twenty died from cancer,
and 3 died from other causes. In total, 38 patients in our
study failed treatment, with 18 patients presenting with a
single site of failure (local, nodal, or distant), of whom 13
were suitable for salvage therapy. Of these 13 patients, 10
had isolated disease at the post-therapy FDG-PET,
whereas 3 relapsed after an initial complete metabolic
response. Historically, salvage hysterectomy after radiotherapy has been reported21 to show a 5-year actuarial survival rate of 49%. In the present study, 4 of 13 patients
were successfully salvaged without further evidence of disease. Two of these 4 patients had an initial complete metabolic response at the post-therapy FDG-PET, 1 of whom
was symptomatic at the time of relapse; the other was not
and was detected through physical examination. Because
of the low event rate, it is difficult to draw meaningful
conclusions regarding salvage outcomes in patients with a
complete metabolic response at a single post-therapy
FDG-PET. Nevertheless, successful salvage could be
achieved in patients presenting both symptomatically or
asymptomatically.
The results of the post-therapy FDG-PET impacted
highly on management decisions. Our previously published series of 249 patients suggests that selection of
patients for salvage with conventional follow-up alone

Cancer

was unsatisfactory11; 15 salvage hysterectomies were performed, with only 5 having pathological confirmed disease and with only 2 remaining free of disease. Salvage
hysterectomy in this series was associated with significant
morbidity. Thirteen patients in the current report were
included in that series, of whom none had salvage hysterectomies. On the basis of our previous results, we did not
routinely offer salvage therapy during the early follow-up
period unless isolated disease was demonstrated by the
surveillance FDG-PET.
It is unclear whether early detection of recurrence
translates to a survival benefit.22 There are no randomized
prospective trials addressing survival benefit or cost-effectiveness of surveillance strategies. In a retrospective study
of 583 consecutive patients, Morice et al.23 could not find
a survival difference in those patients with recurrence
detected symptomatically versus asymptomatically. Intensification of surveillance through serial FDG-PET examinations has recently been reported to have favorable
outcomes in patients with early asymptomatic relapses.19,24,25 However, lead-time bias is a potential confounder, by which patients may appear to have an
artificially longer survival from time of diagnosis of recurrence within the context of a shorter disease-free interval.
Length-time bias, where less aggressive slow-growing disease is identified by the surveillance protocol and associated with better outcomes, is another potential
confounder.
To consider whether serial physical (including pelvic) examinations could be omitted in patients who
achieved a complete metabolic response at post-therapy
FDG-PET, we tested whether asymptomatic relapses
would be detected at a rate <5%, a threshold that we considered to be clinically significant. The majority (70%) of
treated patients achieved a complete metabolic response.
In this cohort, we detected a very low rate (1.6%) of
asymptomatic relapses despite rigorous clinical follow-up.
The findings of this study give strong evidence against the
null hypothesis that the true asymptomatic relapse rate is
equal to 5% (P ¼ .03).
Our results indicate that post-therapy FDG-PET is
a powerful prognostic tool after curative intent chemoradiotherapy of patients with cervical cancer. Recurrences
after complete metabolic response at post-therapy FDGPET are infrequent and very rarely detected through serial
physical and pelvic examinations. Our findings suggest
that patients who relapse after an initial complete metabolic response can be successfully salvaged when their recurrence is detected after the appearance of symptoms. In

Cancer

the context of the majority of patients who achieve a complete metabolic response at a single post-therapy FDGPET (70%), the authors call into question the utility of
follow-up with serial physical examinations. This study
suggests that in this patient cohort, the exploration of less
invasive and resource-intensive follow-up away from the
hospital setting (such as telephone-based follow-up) without serial pelvic examinations may be warranted. A single
post-therapy FDG PET may potentially be a cost-effective
strategy affording greater convenience and less anxiety for
patients, with reduced ongoing costs of outpatient services
for healthcare providers.
The main limitation of this study is that it is a single-institutional study, and the results are not externally
validated. However, our results are consistent with the
survival data reported based on metabolic response that
have previously been reported by Grigsby et al.20 and
Schwarz et al.17 Another limitation of this study is that the
optimal timing for the post-therapy FDG-PET cannot be
concluded from our data. Patients in this study had FDGPET scans at a median interval of 4.9 months after completion of therapy. In the setting of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, there is evidence to suggest a high
rate of false positives when a post-therapy FDG-PET is
performed at 3 months.26 It is now our current practice to
perform the post-therapy FDG-PET at 6 months after
completion of irradiation. This strategy may reduce the
likelihood of false positives by ensuring adequate time for
resolution of metabolic activity, and may reduce false negatives by allowing time for population of micrometastatic
disease to within the limits of spatial PET resolution. The
disadvantage of this strategy is that early asymptomatic
recurrences may be missed, but the impact of asymptomatic relapse detection for patient outcomes in this setting
is as yet unknown. Further research with a well-designed
case-controlled trial may aid in assessing the cost-effectiveness of post-therapy FDG-PET. In conclusion, a single
post-therapy FDG-PET may obviate the need for serial
pelvic examinations in the cohort of patients who achieve
a complete metabolic response.
