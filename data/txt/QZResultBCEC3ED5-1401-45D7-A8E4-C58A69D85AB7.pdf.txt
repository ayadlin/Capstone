Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable partly because no
effective cell cycle–based therapy has been available to both
control tumor cell proliferation and synergize with cytotoxic
killing. PD 0332991 is an orally active small molecule that
potently and specifically inhibits Cdk4 and Cdk6. It has been
shown to induce rapid G1 cell cycle arrest in primary human
myeloma cells and suppress tumor growth in xenograft
models. To improve therapeutic targeting of myeloma
progression, we combined tumor suppression by PD 0332991
with cytotoxic killing by bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor
widely used in myeloma treatment, in the immunocompetent
5T33MM myeloma model. We show that 5T33MM tumor cells
proliferate aggressively in vivo due to expression of cyclin D2,
elevation of Cdk4, and impaired p27Kip1 expression, despite
inhibition of Cdk4/6 by p18INK4c and the maintenance of a
normal plasma cell transcription program. PD 0332991
potently inhibits Cdk4/6-specific phosphorylation of Rb and
cell cycle progression through G1 in aggressively proliferating
primary 5T33MM cells, in vivo and ex vivo. This leads to tumor
suppression and a significant improvement in survival.
Moreover, induction of G1 arrest by PD 0332991 sensitizes
5T33MM tumor cells to killing by bortezomib. Inhibition of
Cdk4/6 by PD 0332991, therefore, effectively controls myeloma
tumor expansion and sensitizes tumor cells to bortezomib
killing in the presence of an intact immune system, thereby
representing a novel and promising cell cycle–based combination therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(14):5519–23]

Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable plasma cell (PC)
malignancy, is characterized by the accumulation of malignant
PCs in the bone marrow (BM), secretion of large amounts of
monoclonal antibody, and bone lesions. Unlike normal PCs, MM
cells retain their self-renewing potential due to deregulation of
the cell cycle, which is particularly relevant during the aggressive
phase of the disease and relapse (1). Progression through the cell
cycle is driven by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) in cooperation
with cyclins and opposed by Cdk inhibitors (2). Aberrant
coactivation of Cdk4-cyclin D1 or Cdk4/Cdk6-cyclin D2 precedes
proliferation of MM cells, demonstrating that deregulation of Cdk4

and Cdk6 is central to the loss of cell cycle control in MM (3).
PD 0332991 is an orally active small molecule that potently and
specifically inhibits Cdk4/6 in a reversible manner (4). It has
emerged as a promising agent for cell cycle–based therapy owing
to its ability to rapidly and specifically inhibit Cdk4 and Cdk6
(IC50, f60 nmol/L) in primary human MM cells (5), as observed in
solid tumor cell lines (4) and confirmed in mantle cell lymphoma
cells and acute myloid leukemia cells (6, 7). This leads to exclusive
G1 arrest and marked tumor suppression in nonobese diabetes
severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) xenografts (5).
However, the antimyeloma activity of PD 0332991 in the presence
of an intact immune system is unknown.
To optimize therapeutic targeting of Cdk4/6 with PD 0332991,
we investigated the efficacy of PD 0332991 in inhibiting Cdk4/6
and controlling aggressive tumor growth in the immunocompetent
5T33MM model. Unlike the conventional NOD-SCID xenografts,
the 5T33MM tumors are maintained by serial transfer into
syngeneic immunocompetent C57BL/KaLwRij mice. Tumors develop in the BM microenvironment, thus uniquely recapitulating
the properties of human myeloma (8). Furthermore, the rapid
tumor development (within 4 weeks) is reminiscent of a relapsed
disease, suggesting that the 5T33MM model is particularly suited
for the development of a cell cycle–based therapy in the presence
of an intact immune system. Here, we show that inhibition of
Cdk4/6 by PD 0332991 induces G1 cell cycle arrest in primary
5T33MM cells in vivo and ex vivo, and suppresses tumor
progression. In combination with the cytotoxic drug bortezomib
(Velcade), PD 0332991 both inhibits cell proliferation and enhances
bortezomib killing. Combining inhibition of Cdk4/6 by PD 0332991
and cytotoxic killing by bortezomib, therefore, is a promising cell
cycle–based combination therapy in myeloma.

Materials and Methods
5TMM models. C57BL/KaLwRij mice were purchased from Harlan
(Horst) and used at ages 6 to 10 wk. They were housed and maintained
following the conditions approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal
Experiments, Vrije Universiteit Brussels (license no. LA1230281). The animal
ethics meet the standards required by the United Kingdom Coordinating
Committee on Cancer Research Guidelines (UKCCCR, 1998).
5TMM tumor cell isolation and analysis. The 5T33MM cells originated
spontaneously in elderly C57BL/KaLwRij mice and have since been
propagated in vivo, by i.v. transfer of the diseased marrow into young
syngeneic mice (9). The development of myeloma was assessed by the level
of monoclonal antibody present in the serum (paraprotein) by protein
electrophoresis. When the paraprotein concentration reached 10 mg/mL,
the mice were sacrificed and the BM was flushed out of femurs and tibiae
and crushed out of the vertebrae. The BM cells were suspended in
supplemented serum-free medium [RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies)]. The
5T33MM cells with >95% viability and >70% purity (assessed by staining
with anti-idiotype antibodies) were enriched by Lympholyte M (Cedarlane)

gradient centrifugation at 1,000 g for 20 min. Ex vivo and in vitro
experiments were performed in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS (Fetal
Clone I; Hyclone). The 5T33MMvt line, clonally identical to the 5T33MM
tumor cells but stroma independent, is maintained in RPMI supplemented
with 10% FCS (Fetal Clone I). PD 0332991 (Pfizer Global Research and
Development) and bortezomib (Millennium Pharmaceuticals) were added
at indicated concentrations and times.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Isolation of total RNA from
splenic resting B cells, PCs, and 5T33MM cells and cDNA synthesis were
performed as described (10). Samples were subjected to real-time PCR
analysis by using Assays-on-Demand gene expression mixes specific for mouse
cyclin D1 (Mm00432359), cyclin D2 (Mm00438071), Cdk4 (Mm01624002),
Cdk6 (Mm00438163), p18 (Mm00483243), p27 (Mm00438168), BLIMP-1
(Mm00476128), IRF-4 (Mm00516431), Bcl-6 (Mm00477633), Pax-5
(Mm0043501), CD138 (Mm00448918), and h-Actin (Mm00607939). Reactions
were carried out in the ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems). The relative amount of products was determined
by the comparative threshold cycle method according to the instructions
of Applied Biosystems.
Immunoblotting. Preparation of whole cell lysates and immunoblotting
were performed as previously described (10), using the following antibodies:
mouse Mabs to Cdk4 (Cell Signaling), Rb, actin (BD PharMingen); rabbit
polyclonal antibodies to pSRb807/811 (Cell Signaling), p27, cyclin D2, and
Cdk6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were developed with the SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology).
The signals were determined by densitometry analysis.
BrdUrd-uptake in vivo and in vitro. For pulse labeling of 5¶-bromo-2¶deoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma), BrdUrd was injected intraperitoneally into
mice 2 h before sacrifice, or added to the cultures in vitro 2 h before
analysis. To assay BrdUrd uptake by immunofluorescence staining, the cells
were spun onto slides, fixed, and incubated with a FITC–anti-BrdUrd
antibody (Roche Diagnostics) and Rhodamine–anti-mouse total IgG
(Southern Biotec), as previously described (11). To measure BrdUrd-uptake
by flow cytometry, cells were stained with the same FITC–anti-BrdUrd
antibody (Roche Diagnostics) and a phycoerythrin-rat anti-mouse IgG Mab
(BD PharMingen). Flow cytometry was performed using a fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) Calibur and the CellQuest software (BD
PharMingen).
Apoptosis assays. DNA content per cell was determined by FACS
immediately after the addition of propidium iodide (PI; 1 Ag/mL). To detect
mitochondrial depolarization, cells were incubated with Mitotracker
(330 nmol/L; Invitrogen) at 37jC for 30 min. The retention of Mitotracker
was assayed by FACS according to the manufacturer’s specification.
Kaplan-Meier curve. After transplantation of the 5T33MM tumors, mice
(n = 9) were treated with vehicle or PD 0332991 (4, 5) between days 7 and
19 in the single-agent study, or treated with vehicle or PD 0332991 between
days 4 and 11 and with bortezomib between days 12 and 24 in combination

therapy (n = 10). Additional naive mice were included as negative controls.
Animals were sacrificed when they showed signs of morbidity, namely hind
limb paralysis.
Statistical analysis. For statistical analysis of the in vitro data, the
Student’s t test was used. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine
the effect of treatment on the survival of the mice. P values of V0.05 were
considered significant.

Results and Discussion
Elevation of Cdk4 and impaired p27Kip1 expression in
5T33MM cells. Loss of G1 cell cycle control precedes unrestrained
proliferation in primary human BM myeloma cells (3). To
determine the basis for the rapid growth of 5T33MM tumors, we
characterized the expression of core G1 cell cycle regulators in
primary BM 5T33MM tumor cells by quantitative real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Compared with resting mouse B cells,
which are positioned at the G0-G1 boundary, normal mouse PCs
isolated from an antibody response expressed cyclin D2 but not
cyclin D1, and Cdk4 but not Cdk6 (Fig. 1A). However, normal PCs
are arrested in early G1 because of increases in p18INK4c, a specific
inhibitor of Cdk4 and Cdk6 (12, 13), and p27Kip1, which inhibits
cyclin E-Cdk2 in late G1 and early S phase (Fig. 1A; refs. 14, 15).
Primary 5T33MM cells expressed comparable levels of cyclin D2
and p18INK4c mRNA but 4-fold higher Cdk4 mRNA and less than
half of p27Kip1 mRNA relative to PCs (Fig. 1A). This is reminiscent
of findings in aggressively growing primary human BM MM cells
(3). Collectively, these results suggest that together with cyclin D2
expression, overexpression of Cdk4 and insufficient p27Kip1
expression in 5T33MM tumor cells overrides inhibition by p18INK4c
to promote cell cycle progression through G1 and S phase entry.
The PC transcription program is maintained in 5T33MM
cells. Aberrant expression of cell cycle genes in 5T33MM cells may
stem from an impaired PC transcriptional program. Apart from
expressing a high level of CD138, PCs were elevated in the
expression of Blimp-1 (16) and IRF-4 (17), two transcription factors
required for PC differentiation, and reduced in Bcl-6 (18) and Pax-5
(19), targets of Blimp-1 repression, when comparing with resting B
cells (Fig. 1B). CD138, Blimp-1, and IRF-4 were similarly elevated,
and Bcl-6 and Pax-5 were accordingly reduced in primary 5T33MM
tumor cells. The appropriate expression of key PC transcription
factors in 5T33MM cells suggests that the PC transcriptional
program is maintained and that deregulation of the cell cycle is due
to inappropriate Cdk4 and p27 expression.

previously described (10). The data are

PD 0332991 for 36 h. BrdUrd was given

5 Ag/mL (ex vivo ) or 40 mg/kg (in vivo ).

and anti-BrdUrd–FITC (green ). D, PI
staining of 5T33MM cells treated in vivo
with vehicle or PD 0332991 (150 mg/kg).
E, Kaplan Meier survival curve. Mice
were treated daily by gavage with either
150 mg/kg PD 0332991 or the vehicle
(lactate buffer; ref. 5) between the 7th and
19th day after injection with 5T33MM cells.
The onset of morbidity in the vehicle
group was on the 22nd day. On average,
the PD 0332991 group lived 10 d longer
(25 versus 35 d; P < 0.003). The data are
representative of two independent
experiments.

PD 0332991 inhibits Cdk4/6 and G1 progression in 5T33MM
cells in vivo and ex vivo. The ability of PD 0332991 to inhibit Cdk4
in 5T33MM cells was determined by assaying Cdk4/6-specific
phosphorylation of Rb on serine807/811 (pSRb; ref. 3). PD 0332991
(1 Amol/L) inhibited pSRb in primary 5T33MM cells ex vivo within
16 hours while maintaining the levels of cyclin D2, Cdk4, and Cdk6
(Fig. 2A).
Phosphorylation of Rb by Cdk4 and Cdk6 in early G1 and cyclin
E/Cdk2 in late G1 facilitates the release of E2F transcription factors
necessary for S phase entry (2). To determine whether inhibition of
Cdk4 by PD 0332991 leads to G1 arrest in 5T33MM cells, BrdUrduptake during the last 2 hours of PD 0332991 treatment (14–16
hours) ex vivo was measured by flow cytometry. Although 5T33MM

cells survive and cycle only for a limited period of time ex vivo, the
uptake of BrdUrd was reduced by 40% (5 versus 3%) after PD
0332991 treatment (Fig. 2B). Validating this result, treating
terminally diseased mice with PD 0332991 (150 mg/kg) for
36 hours led to a 35% reduction of BrdUrd uptake (27 versus
18%) in the 5T33MM tumor cells in vivo (Fig. 2B). Corroborating
the FACS analysis, dual immunofluorescence staining shows a
similar reduction in the proportion of BrdUrd-positive cells among
the IgG-positive tumor cells (Fig. 2C). Because BrdUrd was present
in vivo only for the last 2 hours before analysis, the high rate of
BrdUrd-uptake further showed that 5T33MM tumor cells cycled at
an extraordinarily high rate in vivo, thereby resembling relapsed
disease. PD 0332991 did not induce cell death at the time and

4 times with 0.4 mg/kg bortezomib (s.c. in physiologic water) every 3 d. The onset of morbidity in the vehicle group was on the 17th day. On average, the PD

concentration used based on the analysis of DNA fragmentation
(Fig. 2D). Together, these data show that PD 0332991 induces G1
arrest in the rapidly cycling 5T33MM tumor cells, ex vivo and
in vivo.
Inhibition of Cdk4/6 by PD 0332991 prolongs the survival
of 5T33MM diseased mice. To examine whether inhibition of
Cdk4/6 by PD 0332991 in 5T33MM cells could suppress tumor
progression and prolong survival, mice were inoculated with
5  105 5T33MM cells and treated for 2 weeks with 150 mg/kg
PD 0332991 daily by gavage after the onset of disease (fday 7).
PD 0332991 treatment led to a significant increase in survival, to a
mean of 35 days in the PD 0332991–treated mice compared
with 25 days in vehicle-treated mice (n = 9; P < 0,003; Fig. 2E). No
severe side effects from the PD 0332991 treatment were observed,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (14). July 15, 2008

although tumor growth resumed after discontinuation of the
treatment because PD 0332991 acts reversibly (4). Thus, by
targeting Cdk4 and Cdk6, PD 0332991 suppressed tumor growth
in the aggressive, immunocompetent 5T33MM model and significantly improved the survival of the diseased mice.
Inhibition of Cdk4/6 by PD 0332991 sensitizes 5T33MM
cells to killing by bortezomib. We then asked whether targeting
Cdk4/6 by PD 0332991 would also enhance cytotoxic killing of
5T33MM cells. As a proof of concept, we chose the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib, which is widely used in myeloma treatment
but as a single agent effective in only f30% of cases. pSRb was
reduced in primary 5T33MM tumor cells by 16 hours of ex vivo
treatment with PD 0332991 (1 Amol/L) or bortezomib (3 nmol/L)
alone, and further reduced by PD 0332991 and bortezomib

combined. Although the cyclin D2 level remained unchanged after
PD 0332991 treatment ex vivo, as observed (Fig. 2A), it was
drastically reduced by bortezomib treatment (Fig. 3A). The uptake of
BrdUrd in 5T33MM cells ex vivo was reduced proportional to
inhibition of pSRb in the PD 0332991 response but reduced further
in the bortezomib response (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results
confirm that Cdk4 phosphorylation of Rb is a major determinant for
G-S transition in primary 5T33MM tumor cells and suggest that
reduction of pSRb by bortezomib was due to preferential killing of
S phase cells, whereas that by PD 0332991 was a consequence of
inhibition of Rb phosphorylation.
The possibility that inhibition of Cdk4/6 and induction of G1
arrest may enhance the killing of tumor cells by bortezomib was
then addressed in the 5T33MMvt cells, which are clonally identical
to the 5T33MM tumor cells. Treatment of 5T33MMvt cells with
bortezomib (2–10 nmol/L) alone led to a dose- and time-dependent
reduction of live 5T33MMvt cells, as shown by the profound cell
death (DNA fragmentation) in cells treated with 5 nmol/L of
bortezomib (Fig. 4A–B). The combination of PD 0332991 with
bortezomib induced synergistic apoptosis, which prevented the
accumulation of live cells by 48 hours at low bortezomib
concentration (2–5 nmol/L) and led to eradication of live cells at
10 nmol/L bortezomib. Accordingly, mitochondrial depolarization
indicated by the loss of retention of the Mitotracker dye was
increased by treatment with PD 0332991 and bortezomib compared
to bortezomib alone (Fig. 4C). Thus, inhibition of Cdk4/6 by PD
0332991 leads to G1 arrest and enhances the killing of 5TMM cells
to bortezomib through increased mitochondrial depolarization.
These results are similar to those reported by Huang and colleagues
(20) in primary human BM MM cells.
To determine if the enhanced killing in vitro could lead to prolonged survival in vivo, mice were treated earlier in tumor
development with 150 mg/kg PD 0332991 for 7 days instead of
12 days, and then with a suboptimal concentration of bortezomib
(0.4 mg/kg), 4 times in 12 days (Fig. 4D). With the reduced schedule,
the PD 0332991 treatment still led to a modest prolongation in
survival (a mean of 24 days compared with 20 days in vehicle treated
mice; P < 0,05). At the suboptimal concentration, bortezomib also led
to a mean survival of 23 days. The mice tolerated the PD 0332991/
bortezomib combination therapy and survived even longer (mean of

27 days) than those treated with either agent alone, although this
difference failed to reach statistical significance. In addition, it seems
that there is an initial survival advantage after the combination
treatment, which however is not sustained. This is not surprising
given that PD 0332991 acts reversibly (4), and suggests that repetitive
cycles of alternating PD 0332991 and bortezomib treatments might
be necessary to achieve optimal therapeutic effects. This observation notwithstanding, our data provide evidence in an immunocompetent myeloma model that PD 0332991 can enhance the
antimyeloma effect of bortezomib in combination therapy in vivo.
This study defines the cell cycle defects in 5T33MM cells, and
provides the first direct evidence that PD 0332991 potently inhibits
Cdk4/6 and cell cycle progression through G1 in rapidly cycling
myeloma tumor cells in the presence of an intact immune system.
PD 0332991 is orally bioavialable and acts reversibly. The substantial
improvement in the survival of the PD 0332991–treated mice and the
absence of overt side effects show that PD 0332991 is a powerful
cytostatic agent when used alone. When combined with a cytotoxic
agent such as bortezomib, targeting Cdk4 and Cdk6 with PD 0332991
enhanced the killing of tumor cells by bortezomib both in vitro
and in vivo, in part through induction of mitochondrial depolarization. Taken together, our findings suggest that combining tumor
suppression by targeting Cdk4 and Cdk6 with cytotoxic killing is a
promising strategy for developing an effective cell cycle–based
combination therapy in myeloma. This would be greatly accelerated
by further preclinical studies in the immunocompetent myeloma
models such as the 5T2MM and 5T33MM models.
