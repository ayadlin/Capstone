Abstract
Preclinical studies have shown that hypomethylating agents reverse platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. In
this phase II clinical trial, based upon the results of our phase I dose deﬁning study, we tested the clinical and
biologic activity of low-dose decitabine administered before carboplatin in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer
patients. Among 17 patients with heavily pretreated and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, the regimen induced
a 35% objective response rate (RR) and progression-free survival (PFS) of 10.2 months, with nine patients (53%)
free of progression at 6 months. Global and gene-speciﬁc DNA demethylation was achieved in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and tumors. The number of demethylated genes was greater (P < 0.05) in tumor biopsies from
patients with PFS more than 6 versus less than 6 months (311 vs. 244 genes). Pathways enriched at baseline in
tumors from patients with PFS more than 6 months included cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, drug
transporters, and mitogen-activated protein kinase, toll-like receptor and Jak-STAT signaling pathways, whereas
those enriched in demethylated genes after decitabine treatment included pathways involved in cancer, Wnt
signaling, and apoptosis (P < 0.01). Demethylation of MLH1, RASSF1A, HOXA10, and HOXA11 in tumors positively
correlated with PFS (P < 0.05). Together, the results of this study suggest that low-dose decitabine altered DNA
methylation of genes and cancer pathways, restoring sensitivity to carboplatin in patients with heavily pretreated
ovarian cancer and resulting in a high RR and prolonged PFS. Cancer Res; 72(9); 2197–205. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Women with advanced stage ovarian cancer have a 5-year
survival rate of less than 25% (1). Although most patients
respond to platinum-based chemotherapy, relapses are common, leading to platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, which is
uniformly fatal (2). Similar to other malignancies, ovarian
cancer progression is associated with accumulation of aberAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center, Indiana

rant gene promoter methylation (3, 4), leading to transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSG). Like genetic
changes that affect TSGs to promote tumorigenesis through
deletions or mutations, aberrant epigenetic modiﬁcations also
act as inactivating "hits" during cancer initiation and/or progression (5). In ovarian cancer, speciﬁcally, epigenetic silencing
is known to repress the expression of TSGs such as RASSF1A,
BRCA1, DAPK, and OPCML, and development-associated transcription factors such as HOXA10 and HOXA11 (4, 6, 7), and
such changes are associated with both ovarian cancer initiation and progression to chemotherapy resistance (4, 8).
In-depth characterization of the cancer epigenome during
the past decade has shown that DNA hypomethylating or
histone deacetylation-inhibiting agents can restore the expression of epigenetically silenced TSGs, resulting in antitumor
activity (5, 9). This concept was ﬁrst validated in hematologic
malignancies, for which 2 hypomethylating agents are U.S.
Food and Drug Administration–approved and clinically active
as monotherapy. Although single-agent hypomethylation
strategies have proven disappointing in clinical trials of solid
tumors (10), preclinical studies strongly support the use of
combination regimens, showing the hypomethylating agents
azacitadine and decitabine to restore platinum sensitivity in
chemoresistant ovarian cancer cell lines and xenografts (11–
14). On the basis of this rationale, we conducted a phase I, dose
deﬁning study, combining low-dose decitabine with carboplatin (15). Repetitive, low-dose decitabine has shown improved
clinical activity over bolus administration in hematologic
malignancies (9, 16). We therefore hypothesized that this
schedule of administration over 5 days before platinum would

more effectively induce DNA hypomethylation and TSG reexpression (9, 16), as compared with bolus administration of
higher (and more toxic) doses of decitabine previously tested
(17). We further reasoned that the repetitive administration of
decitabine (a DNA replication-dependent nucleoside analog)
and the time delay to the delivery of the chemotherapeutic
would allow cancer cells to undergo several cycles of division,
thus permitting greater incorporation of decitabine (and inhibition of DNA methyltransferases) and subsequent activation
of chemotherapy response TSGs (18). Our previous trial
showed tolerability of decitabine at a dose of 10 mg/m2 daily
for 5 days preceding carboplatin administration on day 8 in
ovarian cancer patients (15). Pharmacodynamic analyses using
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and DNA
extracted from plasma showed that the regimen was biologically active, as evidenced by global and gene-speciﬁc DNA
hypomethylation (15), setting the stage for this phase II trial.
Here, we report the results of a phase II trial measuring the
clinical and biologic activity of this regimen in patients with
recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We show that
low-dose decitabine alters global and gene-speciﬁc DNA methylation, yielding a high response rate (RR) and prolonged
progression-free survival (PFS) in this patient population.
Decitabine-induced hypomethylation of several ovarian cancer–associated TSGs in tumors positively correlated with PFS,
indicating convergence of biologic and clinical endpoints.

Materials and Methods
Patient population
Patients with ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal carcinomatosis who progressed during or recurred within 6 months
after platinum-based chemotherapy were eligible. Eligibility
included both measurable and detectable disease. Measurable
disease was deﬁned according to Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumor (RECIST 1.0; ref. 19). For patients with nonmeasurable disease, clinically or radiographically detectable
disease, and a pretreatment serum CA-125 level at least twice
the upper limit of normal were required. All patients were at
least 18 years old with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 1, had a life expectancy
of 3 months or more, and were willing to undergo tumor biopsy
or ascites collection before and after decitabine treatment.
Eligibility allowed unlimited number of prior cytotoxics,
required adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function,
and the presence of either ascites or tumor implants that could
be biopsied using imaging-guided techniques. Two core biopsies were required for each time point. Key exclusion criteria
included carboplatin hypersensitivity, brain metastases, grade
2 or more neuropathy, or uncontrolled medical problems. All
patients signed informed consent and the protocol was
approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board.
Treatment plan
Treatment consisted of the DNA hypomethylating agent
decitabine (Eisai) at 10 mg/m2 given intravenously daily for 5
days, and carboplatin (Bristol Meyers Squibb) administered
intravenously on day 8 for an area under the curve of 5, based

2198

on the results of our phase I trial (15). To prevent prolonged
myelosupression (observed during phase I), peg-ﬁlgastrim
(Amgen) was administered on day 9. Each cycle was 4 weeks
and treatment continued until disease progression (PD) or
intolerable toxicity.
Efﬁcacy and toxicity assessments
Adverse events (AE) were assessed on day 1 of each cycle and
graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for AEs,
National Cancer Institute (NCI-CTCAE), v3. Tumor burden was
evaluated radiographically at baseline, before each odd cycle,
when clinically indicated, and at the end of treatment. Investigator-determined best overall response was deﬁned using
RECIST1.0 criteria for patients with measurable tumors. CA125 measurements were obtained from all patients on day 1 of
each cycle and modiﬁed Rustin criteria were used to assess
response only for those patients with detectable disease (20).
Blood, tumor biopsies, and/or ascites collection
For cycles 1 and 2, blood was collected on EDTA at baseline
(pretreatment) and on day 8 (before carboplatin administration), and centrifuged to separate plasma from PBMCs. Ascites
ﬂuid or tumor material were obtained through core biopsies
under radiographic guidance on days 1 (pretreatment) and 8
(before carboplatin) during cycle 1 from all enrolled patients.
After ascites collection, cells were pelleted by centrifugation
and snap frozen.
DNA extraction and bisulphite conversion
DNA was extracted from 200 mL of buffy coat, 1 mL of
plasma, 25 mg tumor tissue, or 200 mL ascites using QIAmp
DNA Blood Mini Kits (Qiagen), as we have previously described
(15). Sodium bisulﬁte conversion of genomic DNA and cleanup
were done using EZ DNA Methylation kits (Zymo Research),
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Methylation assays by Inﬁnium HumanMethylation27
BeadChip hybridization
After bisulﬁte treatment, each sample was whole-genome
ampliﬁed, enzymatically fragmented, and then applied to
Inﬁnium HumanMethylation27 BeadChips (Illumina) using
Illumina-supplied reagents and conditions at the Cleveland
Clinic Genomics Core (Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland,
OH). Details of hybridization and data analysis [including
clustering, functional pathway prediction, and gene ontology
(GO)] are presented online. The Inﬁnium analysis results are
available for download at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
data repository at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) under the accession number GEO31826.
DNA methylation analysis by pyrosequencing
To validate the Inﬁnium bead array results, methylation
levels of candidate-speciﬁc genes were determined by PCR
ampliﬁcation of bisulphate-converted DNA with speciﬁc primers (Supplementary Table S1). Methylated CpG sites in
sequencing reactions were detected using a pyrosequencing
system (Qiagen; ref. 21). Pyro Mark Assay Design and Pyro QCpG software were used for primer design and data analysis,

respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Average methylation levels of individual CpG sites for each
DNA sample were calculated.
Statistical analysis
This was an open-label, single-center phase II study. The
primary objectives were RR, deﬁned as complete response
(CR) or partial response (PR), by either RECIST or modiﬁed
Rustin criteria. Secondary endpoints were clinical beneﬁt
rate, deﬁned as the sum of CRs, PRs, and stable disease (SD)
lasting more than 3 months, PFS, safety, and overall survival
(OS). Translational objectives included measurement of the
regimen's biologic activity as hypomethylation of target
sequences. The optimal 2-stage design was used to test the
null hypothesis H0 that RR  0.050 versus Ha RR  0.250 with
power ¼ 81% and type I error rate ¼ 0.047. The expected
sample size was 12 and the probability of early termination
of 0.630. The design tested the drug combination on 9
patients in the ﬁrst stage, with the expectation that stage
1 would be terminated if no response were recorded. If not
terminated, additional patients were to be recruited (second
stage) to reach a total of 17. H0 would be rejected if more
than 2 of 17 patients responded.
Demographic and baseline characteristics were summarized using medians (with ranges) for continuous variables,
counts, and proportions for categorical variables. Toxicity was
measured by the frequency/percentage and severity of AE.
Paired t tests were used to compare global or gene-speciﬁc
methylation levels. To account for the correlation of measurements from the same subject, methylation data were also
analyzed using linear random–effect models. Factors included
in the model were days and cycle number. Marginal effects
were estimated by averaging over other factors. The Kaplan–
Meier method was used to estimate PFS for different groups
and log-rank test was used to compare the PFS curves of
different groups. Pathway and function analysis was carried
out using DAVID (22) or Pathway Express (23). Normal approximation with 2-sample Z test was used to compare proportions.
A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were done using SAS 9.2 (SAS Inc.) and R
software.

Results
Patients
Eighteen patients consented and 17 were enrolled and
treated, with one woman not meeting the eligibility criteria
(see Methods). As shown in Table 1, 16 patients had measurable and one had detectable disease, whereas 15 women had
platinum-resistant and 2 had platinum-refractory ovarian
cancer. The median age was 60 (range 45–83) and serous
papillary carcinoma was the most common histology (15
patients). The group was heavily pretreated with a median of
5 prior regimens (range 1–10).
Treatment administration and safety
The median number of treatment cycles administered was 6
(range 2–26þ). Causes for treatment discontinuation were

Follow-up (mo)

additional GCIC-deﬁned CR (one patient with detectable
disease who experienced resolution of ascites and normalization of CA125) was recorded, for a RR of 35% [conﬁdence
interval (CI): 14–62, P ¼ 0.0001). Six additional patients had SD
as best response lasting more than 3 months, yielding a clinical
beneﬁt ratio of 70% (95% CI: 44–90). Five patients experienced
progressive disease at ﬁrst assessment. At 6 months, 9 patients
(53%) were without progression. Median PFS was 10.2 months
(95% CI: 1.9–14.8 months, Fig. 1B). The median OS was 13.8
months (95% CI: 10.3 months inﬁnity).
Pharmacodynamic activity
To evaluate biologic effects of the regimen, demethylating
activity in vivo was assessed. PBMCs (n ¼ 17), plasma (n ¼ 17),
paired (pre-/posttreatment) tumor biopsies (n ¼ 10) or ascites
(n ¼ 6) were collected on days 1 and 8 of cycle 1 (tumor biopsies
were attempted but could only be obtained from one patient).
As a surrogate for decitabine-induced global demethylation,
methylation of LINE1 (long interspersed) repetitive elements
in PBMCs DNA was assessed by pyrosequencing. PBMCs
LINE1 methylation levels of all patients analyzed showed
reduced (P < 0.001) DNA methylation on day 8 as compared
with day 1 (Fig. 2A), returning to baseline values by end of study
(in most instances, coinciding with PD). However, signiﬁcant
global demethylation was not observed in tumor biopsies (Fig.
2B). The data, separated by PFS more than 6 or less than 6
months, are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Global, CpG
island DNA methylation was also measured by Inﬁnium bead
arrays, with methylation changes deﬁned based on the b value:
b greater than 0.5 for patients within a group for gene hypermethylation and b less than 0.5 for hypomethylation (i.e.,
demethylation). The overall number of demethylated genes,
as well as genes that remained hypermethylated in PBMCs and
in tumors after decitabine therapy is illustrated using Venn
diagrams (Fig. 2C and D) and correlated with duration of PFS
(>6 or <6 months). The number of demethylated genes (in all
responding patients) was greater in core biopsies obtained
from patients with PFS more than 6 versus less than 6 months
(311 vs. 244 genes) and also in PBMCs (630 genes vs. 474 genes,
PFS > 6 vs. < 6 months). These results, showing a very large
number of shared decitabine-induced demethylated genes in
responders, suggested that treatment-induced gene hypomethylation contributes to the reversal of platinum resistance.

Baseline methylation differences in patients with PFS more
than 6 versus less than 6 months are illustrated by heat maps.
Before decitabine treatment on day 1, substantial differential
methylation was observed between the 2 groups, with 842
genes and 283 hypermethylated genes in PFS more than 6
versus less than 6 months, respectively (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2). Functional clustering analysis of each differentially hypermethylated gene cluster in the 2 groups was done
by GO term enrichment, using DAVID (22). Enrichment (geometric P values < 0.01) of 10 functional clusters was observed
(Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table S2), and 4 clusters were shared
between the 2 patient groups. The top-ranked GO biologic
processes in PFS more than 6 versus less than 6 months were
defense response, inﬂammatory response, and cytokine–cytokine interaction versus immunoglobulin family, immune
response, and cell adhesion (Supplementary Table S2).
To further investigate the potential function of the differentially hypermethylated genes before (day 1) and after (day 8)
decitabine administration, as well as their possible relationship
to clinical responses, pathway enrichment analyses (PathwayExpress; ref. 23) was done. The most signiﬁcant pathway in the
patients with PFS more than 6 months was cytokine–cytokine
receptor interaction (impact factor 14.6; Fig. 3C). Other signaling pathways enriched at baseline in PFS more than 6
months, included ABC transporter, mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), toll-like receptor, and Jak-STAT signaling
pathways. After decitabine treatment, one cluster (Src homology-3 domain) was enriched (geometric P values < 0.01) in
tumors from patients with PFS more than 6 months (of 280
demethylated genes; Supplementary Fig. S3A), compared with
15 enriched clusters in patients with PFS less than 6 months (of
213 genes; Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Fig.
S3A). The pathways most enriched with unique demethylated
genes after decitabine in PFS more than 6 months were pathways in cancers, Wnt signaling pathway, apoptosis, and MAPK
signaling pathway (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
We also used pyrosequencing to assess methylation
changes of speciﬁc ovarian cancer–associated genes in
plasma (cell free) DNA (presumably shed by tumor cells;
ref. 24) and tumors. Selection of speciﬁc genes was based on
the Inﬁnium array results and our previous studies (13–15),
in addition to other reports describing their positive contributions to DNA damage–associated apoptosis and/or

ovarian cancer prognosis/outcome (7, 25–27). Of the 12
genes examined (see Supplementary Table S2), demethylation of 2 tumor suppressors, MLH1, RASSF1A, was observed
on cycle 2, day 8 (Fig. 4A and B). Although the magnitude of
demethylation for the 2 genes is small, both reached statistical signiﬁcance (P < 0.05). In addition, demethylation (P <
0.01) of AKT1S1, a subunit of the mTORC1 that regulates cell
growth and survival, was seen on day 8 for both cycles (Fig.
4C). Furthermore, sustained AKT1S1 demethylation was
apparent, as methylation levels on cycle 2 day 1 were lower
(P < 0.01) compared with cycle 1 day 1.
We also correlated baseline and decitabine-altered tumor
methylation levels for 5 genes in patients having a PFS of longer
or shorter than 6 months. We observed demethylation of
RASSF1A, AKT1S1, and MLH1 (in plasma), in all the patients,
while decitabine demethylation of HOXA10 (Fig. 4E) and
HOXA11 (Supplementary Fig. S4B) speciﬁcally correlated with
a PFS more than 6 months (P < 0.05). Moreover, baseline tumor
methylation levels for the tumor suppressor RASSF1A and the
differentiation-associated genes HOXA10 and HOXA11 (from
tumor/ascites) correlated with PFS more than 6 months (P <

0.05, Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S3). These results pointed
to a potential panel of genes that can be further studied as
prognostic biomarkers for hypomethylating strategies in ovarian cancer.

Discussion
This phase II trial represents a proof-of-principle for the
concept that epigenetic modulation restores sensitivity to
platinum in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer,
resulting in signiﬁcant clinical activity, as measured by high RR
and prolonged PFS. Here, we show that these effects are
modulated through DNA hypomethylation and identify candidate genes and methylation proﬁles correlating with clinical
outcome. These ﬁndings justify further investigation of the
current decitabine/carboplatin combination in ovarian cancer
or other rationally designed epigenetic strategies in solid
tumors.
Toxicities observed in this trial were mild and consistent
with other studies testing hypomethylating agents. More pronounced rates of myelosuppression were recorded in previous

trials examining decitabine-based combinations in lung (28),
ovarian (29), and cervical cancer (30). We attribute the
improved hematopoietic tolerance to the chosen schedule of
low-dose decitabine administration (daily for 5 days) and to
growth factor support provided in our study. Indeed, in recent
studies for malignancies, the repeated low-dose strategy has
shown improved tolerability as compared with bolus administration of higher decitabine doses (16, 17).
Consistent with our previous phase I trial, we observed a
high rate of carboplatin hypersensitivity (36%). Most events
consisted of ﬂushing, rash, and mild respiratory distress, and
responded to steroids and antihistaminics. Subsequent
retreatment with carboplatin was possible by using slower
rates of infusion and steroid premedication (31). Also, the rate

2202

Cancer Res; 72(9) May 1, 2012

of allergic reactions observed here appears higher than previously reported with reexposure to carboplatin (32), suggesting
decitabine may elicit an immunologic response. Indeed, one
hypothesis of allergy development is a failure to epigenetically
silence fetal genes contributing to IgE synthesis and action,
thus favoring Th2- over Th1-mediated immune responses (33).
It has also been reported that hypomethylating agents could
unmask antigens repressed in ovarian cancer (34), thus triggering immune reactions. Interestingly, among the pathways
enriched with hypermethylated genes in patients achieving
PFS more than 6 months, the toll-like receptor and the JakSTAT pathways were identiﬁed (Fig. 3C). Although toll-like

inﬂammatory responses, activating oncogenic pathways such
as NF-kB and MAPK (36). The Jak-STAT pathway mediates
IFN-regulated events and antiproliferative responses, regulates
cytokine signaling, and has been associated with drug resistance (37). Whether immune reactivation plays a role in the
clinical activity of this regimen remains speculative.
The high clinical activity observed in our study is consistent
with recently published results from a trial using the ribonucleoside analog, 5-azacytidine (Celgene) in combination with
platinum. In that study (38), a higher dose (75 mg/m2/d) of the
hypomethylating agent was administered, largely necessary
because of diminished stability of azacytidine caused by additional incorporation into RNA. That combination induced a RR
of 22% and a median PFS of 5.6 months. As treatment with
single-agent carboplatin in this patient population induces
only a small percentage of objective responses (<10%; ref. 39),
which are generally short lived, our study and the recent report
from Fu and colleagues (38) advance the concept and show
that pretreatment with a hypomethylating agent could reverse
platinum resistance in ovarian cancer.
In vivo biologic activity was shown by LINE1 and speciﬁc
gene hypomethylation. Although LINE1 demethylation was
clearly achieved in PBMCs, it did not correlate with tumor
LINE1 methylation. We reasoned that tumor sampling may
have occurred too early during treatment (cycle 1), with

insufﬁcient exposure to decitabine in the tumor milieu, as
compared with the exposure of PBMCs. It is also possible that
tumor LINE1 elements are less sensitive to demethylation,
compared with PBMCs, given the lower percent methylation
of LINE1 in the biopsy (Fig. 2A vs. Fig. 2B). Although PBMC DNA
methylation may not be a reliable surrogate for tumor methylation (40), for one patient who remained on treatment with a
sustained PR more than 2 years, continued hypomethylation of
LINE1 was observed in PBMCs and ascites pellet at 2 years
compared with baseline and earlier cycles (P < 0.01, not
shown), suggesting that PBMC methylation has the potential
to provide tumor-related information, in agreement with a
previous study showing a distinct PBMC "epigenetic signature"
for ovarian cancer (41).
The mechanism underlying restoration of platinum sensitivity by epigenetic intervention is probably linked to a complex signaling program (42). Our global DNA methylation
analyses point to several pathways differentially methylated
in patients who beneﬁted from the regimen. Platinum response
has been hypothesized to involve DNA damage leading to
mitochondrial-activated apoptosis pathways. We observed
demethylation of several genes associated with mitochondrial
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2B), whose reexpression may
associate with decitabine-mediated platinum resensitization.
Another such pathway involves ABC transporters, membrane

proteins that efﬂux chemically diverse compounds across the
plasma membrane (43). ABC transporters have been implicated in the development of drug resistance in cancer cells (44). In
this study, 6 ABC transporter genes (ABCA8, ABCA9, ABCB5,
ABCC10, ABCG1, and ABCG4) were hypermethylated at baseline and after decitabine treatment in patients reaching a PFS
more than 6 months, and this pathway was not identiﬁed as
signiﬁcantly hypermethylated in patients with PFS less than 6
months. These ﬁndings are in agreement with previous observation linking ABCG2 promoter hypomethylation to chemoresistance (45, 46).
Members of the MAPK family play a prominent role in
sensitivity to chemotherapy in many cancers, including ovarian cancer (47), and 16 genes in the MAPK signaling pathway
were hypermethylated in patients with PFS more than 6
months (Fig. 3). These results concur with previous ovarian
cancer studies showing MAPK signaling as an inducer of the
apoptosis-initiating Fas ligand, in response to cisplatin and
other chemotherapeutics (48, 49). Indeed, we did observe
signiﬁcant demethylation of the FASLG in patients with PFS
more than 6 months, in addition to other members of death
receptor pathways, and correlations between FASLG expression and ovarian cancer chemoresponse have also been
reported (50).
In summary, this study provides strong clinical and biologic
evidence supporting further investigation of hypomethylating
strategies in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We identiﬁed a

panel of decitabine-hypomethylated genes, pathways linked to
chemotherapy response, and gene sets whose baseline methylation levels associate with clinical outcome. These data
suggest that not one gene but rather complex genetic machinery involved in drug sensitivity/resistance mechanisms needs
to be reactivated/deactivated to successfully enable resensitization of tumors to platinum. We show that this can be
achieved in vivo by using decitabine, a global DNA hypomethylating agent.
