tumor development and progression and have assigned these
diverse influences to particular subsets of inflammatory cells,
cancer stages, and target tissues (1). Furthermore, controversy
exists regarding the relative importance of interactions of tumorstromal inflammatory cells versus the role of soluble mediators
released during those interactions (2, 3). Many of these insights
have been derived from studies of squamous cell tumor induction
by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) application on mouse skin. For
example, mice deficient for tumor necrosis factor a or its receptors
are resistant to chemically induced skin carcinogenesis (4, 5), a
result attributed to decreased inflammation in the dermis, notably
neutrophil recruitment. Furthermore, skin resident ahT cells and
gyT cells have opposite effects on the sensitivity to DMBA/TPA
chemical skin carcinogenesis (6). In the K14-HPV16 mouse skin
cancer model, B lymphocytes recruit mast cells where they
contribute to the angiogenic response of the stroma (7). The
facilitating role of neutrophils and macrophages on tumor
angiogenesis has also been reported in a matrix inserted surface
transplantation model using oncogene transformed HaCat cells (8).
The recruitment of leukocytes is critically regulated by small
cytokine–like soluble proteins called chemokines under both
homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Mouse neutrophils
express a receptor homologous to human interleukin (IL)8 (CXCL8) receptor or CXCR2. Mouse CXCR2 binds several
CXCL-8 such as CXC chemokines most notably KC (CXCL1) and
macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2/CXCL2/3) and GCP-2
(CXCL6). KC and MIP-2 are related to the three human GRO
chemokines (CXCL1/3). We and others have previously shown that
transgenic mice that overexpress the conventional PKCa in basal
keratinocytes exhibit an acute intraepidermal inflammatory
response when mice were topically exposed to the PKC activator
TPA (9, 10). Driving the inducible cutaneous inflammation is a
PKCa-dependent up-regulation of CXCR2 ligands attracting
neutrophils into the epidermis, forming intraepidermal neutrophilic microabscesses, sloughing of the epidermis and a regenerative hyperplastic response emanating from the intact hair follicle
epithelium (9, 11).
This model system of inducible cutaneous inflammation offered
an opportunity to address several questions related to tumor
development. The relatively pure neutrophilic infiltration provided
an opportunity to address the role of that cell type in the
regenerative response. Epidermal regeneration from hair follicle
cells tested the source of initiated cells. The dependence of the
model on CXCR2-mediated responses provided a setting to
question the function of this receptor and its ligands in tumor
formation. The results indicate that CXCR2 and its ligands
contribute to neoplastic development unexpectedly through an
autocrine response loop that may prove a novel target for
therapy.

Abstract
Transgenic mice that overexpress PKCA in the epidermis
(K5-PKCA mice) exhibit acute CXCR2-mediated intraepidermal neutrophilic inflammation and a strong epidermal
hyperplasia in response to application of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We now show that hyperplasia is
independent of infiltrating neutrophils. Furthermore, when
K5-PKCA mice were initiated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)annthracene (DMBA) and promoted with a low dose of TPA, 58%
of K5-PKCA mice developed skin papillomas that progressed
to carcinoma, whereas wild-type mice did not develop tumors.
We confirmed that CXCR2 is expressed by keratinocytes and
showed that transformation by oncogenic ras (a hallmark of
DMBA initiation) or TPA exposure induced all CXCR2 ligands.
Ras induction of CXCR2 ligands was mediated by autocrine
activation of epidermal growth factor receptor and nuclear
factor-KB, and potentiated by PKCA. Oncogenic ras also
induced CXCR2 ligands in keratinocytes genetically ablated
for CXCR2. However, ras transformed CXCR2 null keratinocytes formed only small skin tumors in orthotopic skin grafts
to CXCR2 intact hosts, whereas transformed wild-type
keratinocytes produced large tumors. In vitro, CXCR2 was
essential for CXCR2 ligand-stimulated migration of ras-transformed keratinocytes and for ligand activation of the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt pathways.
Both migration and activation of ERK and Akt were restored
by CXCR2 reconstitution of CXCR2 null keratinocytes. Thus,
activation of CXCR2 on ras-transformed keratinocytes has
both promigratory and protumorigenic functions. The upregulation of CXCR2 ligands after initiation by oncogenic ras
and promotion with TPA in the mouse skin model provides a
mechanism to stimulate migration by both autocrine and
paracrine pathways and contribute to tumor development.

ready DNA was made using the Sigma GenElute HP maxiprep kit in the
Protein Expression Laboratory (Core Facility of NCI-Frederick). Adenoviruses were amplified in the Viral Technology Laboratory (Core Facility of
NCI-Frederick). The InBaSR adenovirus was introduced into primary
keratinocytes using an adenoviral construct driven by a cytomegalovirus
(CMV) promoter and empty adenovirus was used as control (A-CMV).
Adenoviruses were amplified using QBI 293 cells. Virus was purified over
two CsCl gradients and dialyzed against a buffer containing Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 1 mmol/L MgCl2. Keratinocytes were infected
for 30 min in serum-free medium with a MOI of 5 and 10 viral particles
per cell (InBasr and CXCR2-EGFP, respectively) and 4.0 Ag/mL of Polybrene
(Sigma) to enhance uptake. Serum containing medium was added to the
cells for the next 16 or 48 h after the infection (CXCR2-EGFP and InBasr,
respectively).
Immunoblotting. Cultured keratinocytes transduced with either control
or mCXCR2-GFP adenovirus or an aliquot of cultured cells used for grafting
experiments were lysed in MPER lysis buffer (Pierce) supplemented with
200 Amol/L NaVO3, 10 mmol/L NaF, and Complete Mini tablets (Roche).
Proteins were quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) and separated
by 10% or 18% SDS-PAGE for Akt/ERK or H-ras blotting, respectively. Akt
and phospho-Akt antibodies (Cell Signaling) were used at 1:1,000 overnight,
ERK and phospho-ERK antibodies (Cell Signaling) were used at 1:2,000
for 2 h at room temperature, and H-ras antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) was used at 1:500 overnight at 4jC. ECL SuperSignal (Pierce)
system was used for detection. The intensities of immunoblots were
quantified using ImageJ (NIH), and the relative expression of targeted
proteins was normalized.
In vitro migration assay. On day 3 in culture, CXCR2+/+ and CXCR2/
primary keratinocytes were infected with the v-ras Ha retrovirus then used
for migration assay on day 7. Keratinocytes were trypsinized and
resuspended in ice-cold 0.2% serum culture medium. Cells (5  105) were
plated in the top chamber of noncoated polyethylene terephthalate
membranes Biocoat control inserts (24-well plate insert with a pore size
of 8.0 Am; BD Biosciences). MIP-2 (R&D systems) or transforming growth
factor a (TGFa; R&D systems) were added to the bottom well in 0.2%
serum culture medium at the concentration indicated. The CXCR2 smallmolecule antagonist was synthesized by Dr. Victor E. Marquez and
Krishnan Malolanarasimhan (Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, NCI,
Bethesda, MD) based on the structure previously reported (17). CXCR2
antagonist was added concomitantly to the cells in the top chamber. The
cells were incubated for 24 h, and those that did not migrate through
the pores in the membrane were removed by scraping the membrane
with a cotton swab. Cells on the underside of the membrane were
stained with Diff-Quick (Dade Behring). Cells migrating across the filters
were counted under light microscopy after coding the samples. The
results were expressed as chemotaxis index, which represents the fold
increase in the number of migrated cells in three 40 fields in response
to MIP-2 or TGFa over the spontaneous cell migration in response to
control medium.
Time-lapse-microscopy studies. Keratinocytes were seeded on 12-well
plates. On day 3 in culture, CXCR2+/+ and CXCR2/ primary keratinocytes
were infected with the v-ras Ha retrovirus then used for imaging on day 7 as
described previously (18). Briefly, imaging was performed on an Olympus
IX81 research microscope (Olympus America), equipped with a Proscan
motorized stage (Prior Scientific Instruments Ltd.), and placed in a
temperature-and CO2-controlled chamber (LiveCell Incubation System;
Neue Biosciences). Using relief-contrast optics, 10 images were taken of
each well every 10 min until 100 images were captured. For each variable,
triplicate wells were tracked and images managed using Slidebook 4.0
Digital Microscopy Solutions software (Intelligent Imaging Inovations).
Images were transferred to a workstation equipped with Metamorph image
analysis software (Molecular Devices Corp.), where velocities were
calculated using the track cell module. Per well, 20 keratinocytes were
tracked over the entire time period. From each cell tracked, an average
velocity was calculated.
Proliferation (Thymidine incorporation). Keratinocytes were plated
in 24-well tissue culture trays at 5  104 cells per well. Cells were treated

Materials and Methods
Mice and treatments. Mouse studies were performed under a protocol
approved by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and NIH Animal Care
and Use Committee. The construction and characterization of K5-PKCa
mice on an FVB/N background were previously described (9). K5-PKCa
mice were crossed to homozygous mice deficient in CXCR2. F1 mice K5PKCa/CXCR2+/ were backcrossed to CXCR2+/ to generate K5-PKCa
mice deficient for CXCR2 (11). TPA (Calbiochem) was dissolved in
acetone, and 1 Ag was applied in 200 AL to the shaved dorsal skin of
experimental animals.
Purified rat anti-mouse Ly-6G and Ly-6C (Gr-1, IgG2b, n isotype) and
purified rat IgG2b, n isotype–matched control antibody were purchased
from BD Biosciences. Mice were injected i.p. with 100 Ag of the anti-Gr1
antibody or isotype control 16 h before TPA application. Depletion of
neutrophils reported earlier (12) was confirmed by differential white blood
counts 12 h after TPA (Supplementary Fig. S1A), myeloperoxydase
immunostaining of skin sections collected at 12 and 24 h after TPA
(Supplementary Fig. S1B) and H&E staining of paraffin-embedded skin
sections (data not shown). Approximately 1 h before sacrifice, animals were
injected with 250 to 300 AL of a 3 mg/mL solution of BrdUrd in sterile PBS.
Samples were fixed in formalin or IHC zinc fixative (BD Biosciences) and
embedded in paraffin for H&E analysis and immunohistochemistry. For
BrdUrd staining, sections were treated as recommended by manufacturer
(Roche) using anti–bromodeoxyuridine-POD antibody (clone BMG 6H8).
Apoptosis and CD31 staining were performed by the Pathology/Histotechnology Laboratory (NCI core facility) using, respectively, ApopTag kit
(Millipore), anti–platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1/CD31
antibody (Santa Cruz; sc-1506) and antimyeloperoxidase (DAKO) on zincfixed sections. The microvascular density was determined by counting the
number of CD31-stained cells in at least 5 fields (400 magnification; Nikon
Eclipse E400) per tumor originating from CXCR2 wild-type (WT) or CXCR2
KO v-rasHa–transduced keratinocytes. The antibodies against the mouse
filaggrin and loricrin have been described previously (13).
Tumor induction experiments. The backs of 7-wk-old mice were
shaved 2 d before initiation with DMBA. Initiation was accomplished by a
single topical application of 100 Ag DMBA in 0.2 mL acetone. Promoter
treatments with TPA [1 Ag (1.6 nmoles) in 0.2 mL acetone, twice weekly]
were begun 1 wk after initiation and continued for 20 wk. Skin tumors
induced by the initiation-promotion protocol were removed and both
frozen and formalin fixed at times from 20 to 52 wk after initiation. Tumor
type [squamous papilloma or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)] was verified
by examination of H&E-stained sections of tumors.
Nude mouse grafting. On day 3 in culture, CXCR2+/+ and CXCR2/
primary keratinocytes were infected with the v-ras Ha retrovirus, and
trypsinized and used for grafting on day 8 as described previously (14). Two
million keratinocytes were mixed with 5 million SENCAR mouse dermal
fibroblasts (cultured for 1 wk) and grafted onto the back of nude mice on a
prepared skin graft site (14). Tumor dimensions were measured weekly
using calipers, and approximate tumor volumes were determined by
multiplying tumor height  length  width.
Cell culture. Primary mouse keratinocytes and hair follicle buds were
isolated from newborn transgenic and WT littermate epidermis as
described (14). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-deficient keratinocytes were isolated from pups obtained from EGFR heterozygous
breeding pairs (15).
Retroviral and adenoviral constructs. The v-ras Ha replication
defective ecotropic retrovirus was prepared using c2 producer cells (16).
Retrovirus titers were routinely 1  107 virus/mL. Keratinocytes were
infected with v-ras Ha retrovirus (oncogenic ras) on day 3 at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 1 in medium containing 4 Ag/mL Polybrene (Sigma). The
mouse CXCR2 cDNA cloned into pEGFP-N1 vector (Clonetch) was a kind
gift of Dr. Gao (Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, Bethesda, MD). The Entry clone for
CXCR2-eGFP was transferred to the vector pAd/CMV/V5-DEST (Invitrogen) using Gateway LR recombination per the manufacturer’s protocols.
Adenoviral clones were verified by restriction analysis, and transfection-

with varying concentrations of MIP-2 or PBS for 16 h while pulsed for
the last 4 h with 1 ACi of [3H]-thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech). Cells were fixed using methanol and acetic acid (in a 3:1 ratio),
solubilized in 5 N NaOH, and incorporated counts measured using a
scintillation counter.
Transfection and luciferase reporter. The nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)luciferase plasmid DNA was a gift from Dr. Zheng-Gang Liu (NCI, NIH,
Bethesda, MD). Primary keratinocytes were transfected using Lipofectamine
2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Three days after
ras transduction, transient transfection was carried out for an additional 48
h. Cells were then rinsed twice in PBS and harvested in reporter lysis buffer
(BD Biosciences Clontech). Luciferase activity was measured by using the
luciferase reporter assay kit (BD Biosciences Clontech) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Results were normalized to the total protein
content.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. RNA was isolated from cultured
cells with Trizol after manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis
and real-time PCR analysis was previously described (11). The primer

Results
PKCA overexpression in basal keratinocytes and hair
follicles sensitizes mice to skin carcinogenesis. Application of
TPA to the skin of K5-PKCa mice causes a neutrophilic infiltrate
into the epidermis (9, 11). K5-PKCa mice and their WT littermates
(WT) were compared for susceptibility to 100 Ag DMBA initiation
followed by 1 Ag (1.6 nmoles) TPA twice weekly for 20 weeks of
promotion. By week 21, 58% of the K5-PKCa mice developed
tumors (with an average tumor multiplicity of 4.6 tumors per
tumor-bearing animal), whereas all WT mice were tumor-free
(Table 1A; Fig. 1A). None of the mice in control groups (initiation
or promotion only) developed tumors. Sixty eight percent of
papillomas converted to carcinomas by week 50 (Table 1A)
reflecting the genetic predisposition for malignant skin tumor
development on an FVB/N background (19). Previous studies have
indicated that mice overexpressing PKCa in the epidermis on a
C57/Bl6 background (10) or FVB/N background (20) are not more
susceptible to tumor induction than their WT counterpart.
Although those results seem contradictory with the one we are
currently reporting, they can be explained by the TPA regimen used
for promotion. We have use a much lower dose (1.6 nmoles TPA
twice a week), whereas the study on FVB/N mice used 5 nmoles
TPA twice a week (20) and 3 nmoles TPA thrice a week for the

studies have shown that the intraepidermal neutrophilic infiltration after a single TPA treatment of K5-PKCa mice is followed by a
prominent regenerative epidermal hyperplasia (9). To test the
contribution of neutrophils in the epidermal hyperplasia, K5-PKCa
mice were depleted of their circulating neutrophils using Ly-6G
antibodies. Ly-6G treatment of K5-PKCa mice prevented the
systemic neutrophilia and the subsequent neutrophil infiltration
and microabscess formation in the skin after TPA (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B). After a single TPA application, epidermal
hyperplasia and BrdUrd labeling in neutrophil depleted K5-PKCa
mice and K5-PKCa mice receiving isotype control antibody were
identical (Fig. 1B, C, and D). Collectively, these results show that
PKCa activation causes epidermal hyperplasia independently of
acute infiltration by neutrophils.
Oncogenic ras up-regulates CXCR2 ligands in keratinocytes
through activated PKCA and EGFR. The induction of the CXCR2
ligand CXCL8 by H-rasV12 in HeLa cells has been reported
previously (21). In the DMBA/TPA skin carcinogenesis model,
virtually all tumors are initiated through mutational activation of
H-ras raising the possibility that initiated cells could contribute to
the chemokine milieu in the skin tumor microenvironment and
thus to tumor formation. As seen in Fig. 2A, introduction of
oncogenic ras into keratinocytes up-regulates mRNA expression of
all three CXCR2 ligands (KC, MIP-2, and GCP-2). Keratinocytes also
express the receptor CXCR2 itself, although oncogenic ras does not
enhance the expression of the receptor CXCR2 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Upregulation and secretion of these ligands by TPA has been shown to
be mediated through PKCa and NF-nB (11, 22). Oncogenic ras also
increased the secretion of MIP-2 (Fig. 2B) and KC (data not shown)
by keratinocytes. Blocking NF-nB transcriptional activity by
introducing a dominant negative InB adenovirus reduced the
v-ras mediated secretion of MIP-2 (Fig. 2B). PKCa overexpression
also enhanced oncogenic ras-mediated MIP-2 secretion, and this
was also regulated by NF-nB. Blocking NF-nB did not affect CXCR2
mRNA expression (data not shown).
Previous studies have shown that oncogenic ras establishes an
autocrine loop through the EGFR in murine keratinocytes by upregulating EGFR ligands (23). To test whether EGFR autocrine
signaling contributes to PKCa-mediated induction of CXCR2
ligands in v-ras transformed keratinocytes, we used keratinocytes
from mice genetically ablated for the EGFR (15). Disruption of
autocrine EGFR signaling abolished the induction of MIP-2 and
strongly reduced the induction of KC (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these
result suggest that ras-induced expression of CXCR2 ligands
requires EGFR signaling and PKCa mediated activation of NF-nB.
CXCR2-deficient keratinocytes are defective in tumor
formation. We have reported that the cutaneous inflammation
in response to PKCa activation is ablated in the absence of CXCR2
(11). The functional significance of CXCR2 expression by keratinocyte during skin carcinogenesis was tested by transducing primary
keratinocytes from CXCR2 null mice with the v-ras Ha retrovirus
and transplanting transduced tumorigenic cells to a prepared
orthotopic graft site on nude mice that are otherwise CXCR2 intact.
By this approach, tumor formation is dependent solely on the
grafted keratinocyte CXCR2 as the host is competent for CXCR2
expression. As shown in Fig. 3A, tumor growth is retarded in the
absence of keratinocyte CXCR2 relative to CXCR2 WT keratinocytes. Furthermore, tumor latency was greater and fewer mice
hosting grafts lacking CXCR2 formed tumors than intact controls
(Table 1B). The expression of rasHa was similar among the two
keratinocyte genotypes as shown by Western blot from an aliquot

other study (10), conditions that were favorable for tumor
development in WT mice. Our results show that PKCa overexpression in basal keratinocytes and potentially the consequent
acute inflammation sensitize mice to skin carcinogenesis using a
limiting DMBA initiation-TPA promotion protocol.
PKCA activation causes epidermal hyperplasia independently of acute neutrophil infiltration in the skin. Previous

pattern (Fig. 3D), and microvasculature density was the same
among the two groups (Fig. 3D), therefore, it is unlikely that the
tumor growth difference was related to a defective paracrine
angiogenic response by the host. Collectively, these results suggest
that an autocrine/paracrine activation of keratinocyte CXCR2
contributes to the tumorigenic properties of Ras transformed
keratinocytes.
CXCR2 deficiency impairs the migratory properties of
transformed keratinocytes. The small size of tumors from
v-ras Ha keratinocytes lacking CXCR2 strongly suggested a functional role for CXCR2 on keratinocytes and their transformed

of grafted cells (Fig. 3A, insert). Proliferation in tumors arising from
CXCR2-deficient v-ras keratinocytes was reduced by 31% when
assayed by BrdUrd staining (Fig. 3B). The number of apoptotic cells
detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase–mediated dUTP
nick-end labeling staining was similar in tumors originating from
either genotype (Fig. 3C). ELR+ chemokines have been shown to
have a direct proangiogenic activity on CXCR2 expressing
endothelial cells. Because oncogenic ras induces CXCR2 ligand
(MIP-2, KC, and GCP-2) expression similarly in primary keratinocytes from both genotypes (Supplementary Fig. S2) and CD31

cultured ras transformed keratinocytes. Similarly, cell proliferation
was identical in CXCR2-deficient v-ras Ha–transformed keratinocytes and their WT counterpart (Supplementary Fig. S3B),
suggesting that the reduction of proliferation observed in the
tumors in vivo might be a secondary event to CXCR2 deficiency. 3(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays
revealed a similar TPA dose-dependent loss of cell viability in
CXCR2-deficient v-ras Ha–transformed keratinocytes and their WT
counterpart (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Because activation of
CXCR2 on hematopoietic cells results in a migratory response,
we considered that the receptor on keratinocytes might have a
similar function. Using Transwell inserts, we documented a
chemotactic response of v-ras Ha–transformed WT keratinocytes
toward a MIP-2 gradient and that response was absent in CXCR2deficient v-ras keratinocytes (Fig. 4A). Treatment of CXCR2 WT
v-ras keratinocytes with a CXCR2 antagonist prevented their
migratory response to MIP-2 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, keratinocytes of
both genotypes migrate similarly in response to TGFa (Fig. 4A).
Basal cell motility (measured by tracking cell movement) was
identical in CXCR2 WT (0.42 F 0.07 Am/min.) and CXCR2-deficient
v-ras keratinocytes (0.49 F 0.07 Am/min.). These observations
suggest that the lack of chemotaxis in CXCR2-deficient v-ras
keratinocytes was not due to defective cell motility. These data
support a primary autocrine role for CXCR2 on the migration of
transformed keratinocytes that in turn may be required for their
tumorigenic outgrowth.
CXCR2 deficiency has previously been shown to delay skin
wound healing after excisional punch biopsy, owing to a migration
defect of CXCR2-deficient keratinocytes (24). A single low-dose TPA
exposure on K5-PKCa skin causes sloughing of the epidermis
followed by complete regeneration (9). We tested whether
migration secondary to CXCR2 expression would contribute to
the epidermal regenerative response. In crosses of K5-PKCa/
CXCR2 KO mice, the skin is normal (Fig. 4B, Day 0). Two days after
TPA treatment, a nascent regenerative hyperplasia is observed in
K5-PKCa/CXCR2 WT mice and a well-organized stratification of
the hyperplastic epidermis is evident at day 3. In contrast,
regeneration and hyperplasia are delayed in K5-PKCa/CXCR2 KO
mice, and the epidermis that forms is deficient in the late
epidermal differentiation markers loricrin and filaggrin at day 3
(Fig. 4C) in contrast to mice expressing CXCR2. By day 5, both
differentiation markers are properly expressed in K5-PKCa/CXCR2
KO mice and hyperplasia is maximal. This delay in regenerative
hyperplasia and expression of differentiation markers likely reflects
the importance of CXCR2 in regulating keratinocyte migration both
in vitro and in vivo.
To further show that CXCR2 is directly involved in keratinocytes
migration, CXCR2-deficient v-ras keratinocytes were transduced
with an adenovirus encoding for mouse CXCR2. As shown on
Fig. 5A, CXCR2 reconstitution restored the chemotactic response to
MIP-2. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) pathways are two major signal
transduction pathways activated by CXCR2 in response to its
ligands (25, 26). We tested the ligand-induced phosphorylation of
ERK and Akt as indicators of MAPK and PI3K pathways activation
in ras transformed keratinocytes. As shown in Fig. 5B both MAPK
and PI3K pathways are activated by MIP-2 when CXCR2 null rastransformed keratinocyte are reconstituted with CXCR2 but not in
the absence of reconstitution. TGFa activated similarly those
pathways in both CXCR2-deficient and CXCR2-reconstituted rastransformed keratinocytes. Whether those two pathways are

Protumorigenic Function of Keratinocyte CXCR2

The skin carcinogenesis model has been particularly useful for
illuminating the contribution of immune/inflammatory components for tumor development (4, 5, 7, 30). These studies have
revealed often opposing influences on tumor growth, immune
surveillance, and angiogenesis of both humoral and cellular factors
that are present in the tumor microenvironment. They have also
emphasized crosstalk between tumor cells and the stroma to create
the proper microenvironment. Less focus has been directed at
potential tumor-tumor autocrine consequences of factors in the
microenvironment. The current studies suggest how potential
autocrine interactions can influence tumor development. The
development of K5-PKCa mice that exhibit cutaneous inflammation in response to TPA provided an inducible system for the
recruitment of neutrophils to the skin that specifically depends on
keratinocyte-derived CXCR2 ligands (9, 11). TPA also causes
epidermal desquamation on K5-PKCa mice that is independent
of CXCR2 ligands (11). We now show that K5-PKCa mice exhibit
increased sensitivity to tumor formation in the two-stage skin
carcinogenesis model. Because recovery from epidermal desquamation occurs through migration and proliferation of hair follicles
keratinocytes, we conclude that the initiated cells in this model

functionally linked to the chemotactic response in ras-transformed
keratinocytes require further pharmacologic and genetic analysis.
Thus, two essential signaling pathways, linked to skin tumor
formation, are downstream from the interaction of keratinocyte
CXCR2 and its ligands.

Discussion
Cutaneous SCC is the second most common cancer in the
United States after basal cell carcinoma. Activating mutations in
ras genes are observed in human SCC (27) and in experimental
cutaneous SCC induction in mice (28), and in the absence of
mutations, human SCCs frequently show increased Ras activity and
MAPK activation (29). Although many downstream effectors of
active ras have been delineated, those most critical for cutaneous
SCC development remain obscure. Our current study shows that
CXCR2 ligands are transcriptional targets of oncogenic ras in
primary keratinocytes. We further show that CXCR2 ligand
induction by oncogenic ras requires intact NF-nB nuclear
translocation, is potentiated by PKCa, and is mediated through
the EGFR. These findings connect three essential pathways in
experimental skin carcinogenesis.

keratinocytes. A, 5 d after v-rasHa

tumor growth in our grafts of CXCR2 null–transformed keratinocytes cannot be explained by defective angiogenesis. The CXCR2
null tumor cells express abundant CXCR2 ligands (resulting from
intact NF-nB activity in those cells; see Supplementary Fig. S3E),
the host endothelial cells were CXCR2 competent, and blood vessel
density was similar in tumors from CXCR2 null and intact
keratinocytes.
What then are the consequences of ligand activation of
keratinocyte CXCR2? BrdUrd labeling shows a modest reduction
in the number of proliferative cells in tumors derived from CXCR2
null keratinocytes, but, in vitro, CXCR2 ligands did not stimulate
keratinocyte proliferation nor did oncogenic ras have a differential
effect on proliferation of the two genotypes. Our studies indicate
that CXCR2 activation mediates the migration of transformed
keratinocytes in vitro, and migration is delayed in CXCR2 null
epidermis after TPA-imposed epidermal desquamation. This result
is consistent with the slow migration seen in CXCR2 null epidermis
during cutaneous wound repair (24) and could perhaps impede cell
turnover in tumors. Keratinocyte migration in response to autocrine
or paracrine CXCR2 activation could provide the initiated cells with
an advantage particularly during the early steps of tumor
development when forming a critical clone size is necessary to
expand in the context of a tightly regulated epithelial compartment
(37). This assumption is consistent with the finding that CXCR2
deficiency did not alter the malignant conversion rate of grafted
tumor cells, which occurs as a late event in tumor progression.
Previously, CXCR2 ligands have been shown to enhance proliferation of human cancer cell lines (38, 39), but in the transformation of
lining epithelial cells, migration may be particularly important to
expand the zone of early transformants (37). Crosstalk between
CXCR1/2 with EGFR has also been reported in human ovarian
cancer cells (40), and we considered that the smaller tumor size
could be related to changes in EGFR responses. However, the
migratory response (Fig. 4) and proliferative response (data not
shown) to exogenous TGFa in both CXCR2 WT and KO
keratinocytes were similar. MAPK activity was increased in
response to TGFa in CXCR2-deficient and CXCR2 reconstituted
transformed keratinocytes (Fig. 5) although MAPK was not
activated in CXCR2-deficient cells by CXCR2 ligands. Our reconstitution studies show that activation of both MAPK and Akt are
downstream of CXCR2 activation in transformed keratinocytes.
These two pathways have been linked to CXCR2 mediated cell
migration in several cell lines (25, 26), but recent studies suggest the
association is more complex and involves additional pathways (41).
Further studies will be required to understand how signaling
through CXCR2 in transformed keratinocytes regulates migration
and how this migratory pathway contributes to tumor formation.
In human keratinocytes, EGFR activation causes a strong upregulation of IL-8 (42, 43). Similarly, oncogenic ras induces
transcripts of the EGF ligand family (namely TGFa, betacellulin,
amphiregulin, and HB-EGF) and therefore contributes to the
establishment of an autocrine loop (23, 44, 45). We have shown
previously that papillomas expressing v-ras but deficient for EGFR
are growth impaired, but the proliferative pool of cells is not
reduced. Instead, the tumor cells show altered migration and
premature differentiation (46). Our current study reveals that
autocrine stimulation of EGFR is necessary for oncogenic ras–
mediated induction of CXCR2 ligands. This result suggests that
up-regulation of CXCR2 ligands cannot be directly compensated by
the constitutively active viral ras protein, and autocrine-activated
EGFR is an essential mediator of this pathway in keratinocytes.

Figure 5. Reconstitution of CXCR2 KO keratinocytes with CXCR2 restores
chemotaxis and signaling after MIP-2 treatment. On the 4th day after v-ras
transduction, CXCR2 null primary keratinocytes were transduced with an empty
adenovirus (control Ad ) or CXCR2 expressing adenovirus (CXCR2 Ad) for an
additional 24 h and assayed for their ability to migrate in response to MIP-2
using the Transwell assays (A ) as described in Fig. 4 or (B) stimulated with
200 ng/mL MIP-2 or 10 ng/mL TGFa for 5 min. Western blots were performed for
total and phospho-ERK 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and total and phospho-Akt (p-Akt) as
described under Materials and Methods. Relative levels of phospho-Akt and
phospho-ERK are indicated in each figure normalized to the PBS-treated cells.

must reside in the hair follicle compartment (31, 32). Our results
also link CXCR2 on keratinocytes to tumor formation in vivo.
Specifically, when CXCR2-deficient v-ras–transformed primary
keratinocytes are grafted orthotopically to CXCR2 competent
hosts, tumor growth is severely retarded.
CXCR2 is strongly expressed by leukocytes, but it is also present
on endothelial cells and embryonic and adult keratinocytes (24, 33).
Our study also shows that secreted CXCR2 ligands from rastransformed keratinocytes could not only recruit immune cells into
the tumor microenvironment but could also promote angiogenesis
and act directly on neoplastic keratinocytes in an autocrine/
paracrine manner. It is also likely that transformed keratinocytes
could respond to CXCR2 ligands produced by neutrophils and
endothelial cells present in the stroma (34). CXCR2 ligands are
proangiogenic in xenografts (21), grafted murine SCC cells (35), and
models of lung and pancreatic cancers (36). However, retarded

site. That therapeutic approach would also benefit from the
blockade of keratinocyte CXCR2 as our results suggest that it
contributes important autocrine/paracrine function during skin
carcinogenesis.

The K5-PKCa mouse model has proven useful for addressing
other consequences of inflammation in skin tumor development.
For example, it has been proposed that the inflammatory infiltrate
contributes to the sustained hyperplasia associated with tumor
promotion. However, neutrophil depletion in K5-PKCa mice using
an anti– Gr-1 antibody had no overt consequence on skin
hyperplasia after TPA application. Because an anti-Gr1–based
approach allows only for a temporary depletion of neutrophil as it
is followed by a rebound in granulocytes counts (47), it therefore
does not allow for the study of the contribution of neutrophils
during a complete promotion stage. Interestingly, the pioneer work
of the Schreiber’ group showed that elimination of Gr-1+ leukocytes
in athymic nude mice slowed the growth of a variant of a UV light–
induced tumor (48). Activation of CXCR2 on Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid
cells (also called myeloid-derived suppressor cells) was recently
shown to mediate their recruitment to mammary carcinoma (49).
Gr1+CD11b+ cells can contribute to tumor immune evasion ( for
review see ref. 50), angiogenesis, but also tumor invasion and
metastasis (49). Therefore blocking CXCR2 seems as an attractive
target to prevent the recruitment of Gr-1+ leukocytes to the tumor
