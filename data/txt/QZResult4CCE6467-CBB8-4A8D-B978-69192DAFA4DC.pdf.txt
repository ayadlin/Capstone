ABSTRACT
The role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cancer has been studied in
detail, and ER stress is known to increase tumor cell apoptosis, and thus, reduce
tumor growth. However, in our study, persistent ER stress induced by multiple
administrations of low-dose thapsigargin (Tg) accelerated tumor growth in mice.
Tg-mediated ER stress increased the generation of Ly6G+CD11b+ myeloid cells, but
did not alter anti-tumor effector T cells. 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), a chemical
chaperone widely used as an ER stress reducer, attenuated Tg-induced myeloidderived suppressor cell (MDSC) expansion and tumor growth. Tg-mediated ER stress
enhanced the immunosuppressive capacity of tumor-infiltrating MDSCs by increasing
expression of ARG1, iNOS, and NOX2, although splenic MDSCs were not affected.
Consistent with these results, 4-PBA restored the anti-tumor immune response by
regulating inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and CXCL1/KC, and activated tumorinfiltrating CD8+ T cells that were inhibited by Tg-mediated ER stress. These results
suggest that significant ER stress in a tumor-bearing host might induce tumor growth
mediated by enhancement of MDSC-mediated suppression. Therefore, ER stress
reducers such as 4-PBA could restore anti-tumor immunity by inhibiting suppressive
MDSCs that are exacerbated by ER stress.

of Tg induced non-selective apoptosis of host cells,
including proliferative and quiescent cells [2], indicating
that Tg might not be a good candidate anticancer drug
for systemic administration. To overcome this limitation,
targeted delivery of Tg has been evaluated in several
murine cancer models [1, 3].
Although direct induction of apoptotic death in
cancer cells may be critical for therapeutic antitumor

INTRODUCTION
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induction in
cancer cells was once a promising strategy for efficiently
inducing apoptosis of cancer cells, and several ER stress
inducers, including thapsigargin (Tg), a sarcoplasmic/
endoplasmic Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor, were evaluated as
anticancer drugs [1]. However, systemic administration

against cancer cells has also been shown to efficiently
inhibit tumor growth and eradicate residual tumor cells.
In this regard, Tg-induced cell death could beneficially
induce tumor-specific immunity following phagocytosis
by dendritic cells [1]. We as well as other researchers have
provided evidence supporting the combined therapeutic
strategy of apoptosis induction by anticancer drugs and
activation of the host immune system to remove residual
cancer cells [4].
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are
heterogeneous cell populations consisting of immature
myeloid cells including immature macrophages,
granulocytes, and dendritic cells. They are found in the
blood, liver, and spleen, as well as in tumor cells [5, 6].
More importantly, it has been suggested that tumorassociated suppressor cells, including MDSCs, inhibit the
tumor-specific immune response, and inflammation caused
by non-selective ER stress-mediated cell death could be
associated with the induction of MDSC-like cells [7].
Here we investigated the effect of ER stress induced
by treatment with Tg, an ER stress inducer, on tumor
growth. Surprisingly, systemic administration of Tg did
not inhibit tumor growth, but instead, increased tumor
growth. Although the role of ER stress in cancer has
been studied in detail, the effects of ER stress on tumorassociated immune cells, especially MDSCs, have not
been reported. Thus, we studied the effect of ER stress
on MDSC generation after Tg administration in vivo.
Interestingly, persistent and systemic ER stress induced
by low dose and long-term administration of Tg increased
MDSC generation in the spleens of tumor-bearing mice.
More importantly, the immunosuppressive function
of MDSCs, which is mediated by ARG1, iNOS, and
NOX2, was also significantly increased by Tg treatment.
Alleviation of ER stress by the administration of 4-PBA,
a chemical chaperone used as an ER stress reducer [8],
effectively restored the level of MDSCs and ameliorated
their suppressive function in the tumor tissues, but had
no effect on MDSCs in the spleen. Consistent with these
results, accelerated tumor growth triggered by Tg was
inhibited by 4-PBA treatment. These results suggest that
ER stress in a tumor-bearing host might induce tumor
growth by reinforcing the suppressive function of MDSCs
within the tumor microenvironment.

apoptosis in both proliferative and quiescent cells,
it cannot be administered systemically because of
host toxicity that is related to its non-selectivity [11].
However, several reports have shown a direct anticancer
activity in vivo using a targeted Tg delivery system
[3, 11]. Thus, we assessed the anticancer activity of Tg
in a murine colon cancer model. To reduce systemic
and acute host toxicity, we adopted a low dose and
long-term Tg treatment regimen. Groups of mice
were subcutaneously administered 1 × 106 CT26 cells
expressing HER2/neu (HER2/CT26 cells), and 100 μg/kg
of Tg was intraperitoneally injected daily starting when
tumor sizes reached 50-100 mm3. To our surprise, tumor
growth was significantly increased in mice treated with
Tg as compared with mice treated with the vehicle control
(Figure 1A). When isolated tumor masses were analyzed,
Tg treatment was significantly associated with increased
tumor weight (Figure 1B). These results suggest that ER
stress induction by systemic low dose Tg treatment can
enhance tumor growth in vivo.

Tg evoked ER stress and cell death in
HER2/CT26 cells in vitro
To verify ER stress in tumor and immune cells in
the tumor microenvironment, we assessed the ER stress
response and the subsequent cell death in HER2/CT26
cells and splenocytes 24 h after Tg treatment. We first
confirmed the influence of Tg treatment on the ER stress
response in HER2/CT26 tumor cells by measuring ER
stress-induced XBP1 mRNA splicing [12]. XBP1 slicing
was detected when HER2/CT26 cells were treated with
100 nM Tg (Figure 1C). Tg treatment mediated the ER
stress response by transcriptional activation of several ER
stress-related genes, including BiP, TNF-α, Erdj4, CXCL1,
and ATF4 (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure 1).
Activation of the PERK-eIF2α pathway is another
characteristic of the ER stress response. Tg treatment
increased protein expression of ATF4 and Chop and
phosphorylation of eIF2α, PERK, and IKBalpha,
suggesting activation of the PERK-eIF2α pathway
(Figure 1E). These results clearly show that Tg treatment
induced ER stress in HER2/CT26 cells. We then evaluated
whether ER stress induced by Tg treatment influences cell
death. Tg treatment at concentrations lower than 10 nM
did not reduce cell viability in HER2/CT26 cells or
splenocytes (Figures 1F and 1G). However, concentrations
of Tg greater than 100 nM induced significant cell death in
HER2/CT26 cells and splenocytes.
These results suggest that Tg treatment at high
concentrations induces ER stress and cell death. In
contrast, 10 nM Tg induced the ER stress response
and increased transcriptional activation of Bip, protein
expression of ATF4, and phosphorylation of PERK
without inducing significant cytotoxicity. However,
considered together with tumor growth observations, these

antigens. Although there was a significant decrease in
the percentage of CD8+ T cells in the spleens of mice

mice (Figure 2A), the absolute number of splenic CD8+
T cells was not changed (Figure 2B). In addition, memory

reduces the tumor antigen-specific CTL response by in
vivo CTL analysis. There was no significant decrease in
the HER2/neu-specific CTL response after Tg treatment in
tumor-draining LNs or in the spleen (Figures 2D and 2E).
We also examined the population of CD4+ T cells.
Similar to CD8+ T cells, the percentage of CD4+ T cells
was decreased (Figure 2F), but there was no significant
decrease in the number of CD4+ cells after Tg treatment
(Figure 2G). These results indicate that the acceleration
of tumor growth produced by Tg treatment might not
be attributed to inhibition of antitumor effector T cells.
In addition, there appeared to be no significant systemic
impairment in the tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic activity

as compared with vehicle control mice (7.0 ± 1.28%,
Figure 3A and 3B). In the absence of tumor, percentages
of splenic Ly6G+CD11b+ MDSCs were low regardless
of Tg treatment. Previously, it was reported that
Ly6G+CD11b+ MDSCs consisted of more than 2 major
subsets, including monocytic Ly6Chigh Ly6Gintermediate
CD11b+ and granulocytic Ly6Cintermediate Ly6Ghigh CD11b+
cells. Thus, we investigated changes in the subpopulations
of CD11b+ MDSCs in mice after Tg treatment. In spite
of the expansion of Ly6G+CD11b+ MDSCs, the relative
abundance of each population was not significantly
changed by Tg treatment (Figures 3C–E). These results
suggest that Tg treatment might enhance tumor growth via
modulation of MDSCs.

Because percentages of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
were decreased in mice with larger tumor mass after

myeloid cells might have been expanded. Tg treatment
significantly increased Ly6G+CD11b+ MDSCs in the
spleen of HER2/CT26-bearing mice (16.4 ± 2.58%),

Tumor ER stress was recently suggested to be
linked to the generation of tumor-infiltrating inflammatory
myeloid cells [14]. Thus, we hypothesized that the
increased ER stress in the tumor microenvironment could
lead to induction of MDSCs in vivo, and therefore mediate
tumor growth enhancement. To test this hypothesis,

4-PBA was used to attenuate Tg-induced ER stress in
tumor-bearing mice. 4-PBA is a chemical chaperone
that can decrease the ER stress response and act as a
histone deacetylase inhibitor [8]. When the growth of
HER2/CT26 tumors was monitored, we found that the
increased tumor growth induced by Tg treatment was
dramatically inhibited by coadministration of 4-PBA
(Figure 4A). In another tumor model using TC-1 cells,

Tg-induced tumor growth was also significantly inhibited
by coadministration of 4-PBA (Figure 4B). In addition,
the survival of Tg-treated mice was significantly
increased by 4-PBA, compared to vehicle treatment group
(Supplementary Figure 2).
To assess the potential of 4-PBA to reduce MDSC
generation induced by ER stress, we examined splenic
MDSCs. Treatment with Tg significantly increased

Ly6G+CD11b+ MDSCs in the spleen, and coadministration
of 4-PBA significantly reduced the percentage and absolute
number of Ly6G+CD11b+ MDSCs, as compared with
those of Tg-treated tumor-bearing mice (Figure 4C-E).
However, in contrast to the results in splenic MDSCs,
when tumor-infiltrating MDSCs were examined in tumorbearing mice, we found that neither the percentage nor
the absolute number of Ly6G+ MDSCs was increased
(Supplementary Figures 3A-C). The subpopulation of
CD11b+ MDSCs, including Ly6Ghigh Ly6Cint and Ly6Gint
Ly6Chigh cells, showed a similar profile, except for an
increased Ly6Ghigh Ly6Chigh population in the presence of
ER stress (Supplementary Figure 3D-G). These results
suggest that 4-PBA mitigates ER stress in the tumor
microenvironment, leading to reduced tumor growth,
and inhibits the expansion of splenic, but not tumorinfiltrating, Ly6G+CD11b+ MDSCs.

These results suggest that Tg-mediated ER stress enhances
the immunosuppressive capacity of MDSCs at the local
tumor site, which was mitigated by 4-PBA treatment.

4-PBA restored anti-tumor immunity via
dampening suppressive MDSCs exacerbated
by ER stress
Previously, we reported the conversion of
immunosuppressive MDSCs into immunogenic Agpresenting cells (APCs) using activated invariant NKT
cells, and that immunogenic APCs converted from
MDSCs expressed significantly increased levels of
costimulatory molecules, including CD40 and CD86 [5].
When we measured the expression of costimulatory
molecules in MDSCs, CD40 and CD86 expression on
splenic MDSCs was not changed by treatment with Tg or
4-PBA (Supplementary Figure 4).
To identify factors associated with the Tg-mediated
increased immunosuppressive function of tumor-resident
MDSCs, we first assessed levels of hypoxia inducible
factors (HIFs), which have been shown to induce
tumor angiogenesis and to be increased in the tumor
microenvironment [19]. Increased levels of HIFα proteins
activate PI3K-AKT-mTOR-STAT3 signaling [20] and thus
could enhance the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs
in tumors. We found that Tg-mediated ER stress induced
expression of HIF transcription factors (Supplementary
Figure 5). Tg-mediated increases in HIF-1α and HIF-2α
in the tumor microenvironment were attenuated by 4-PBA.
In addition, NF-κB-dependent inflammatory
cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and CXCL1/KC have been
linked with the enhanced immunosuppressive activity of
tumor-infiltrating MDSCs [14, 21]. Expression of these
proinflammatory cytokines was enhanced by Tg-mediated
ER stress, and this increased expression was attenuated
by 4-PBA treatment (Figure 6A-C). Finally, we found that
the abundance and activation status of tumor-infiltrating
CD8+ T cells were restored by 4-PBA, which might be
ascribable to attenuated suppressive capacity of MDSCs
by reduced ER stress (Figure 6D-G). On the contrary,
tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells showed no significant
differences regardless of treatment. Taken together, these
results show that 4-PBA restored anti-tumor immunity by
dampening the ER stress-exacerbated suppressive capacity
of MDSCs.

ER stress reinforced immunosuppressive
function of MDSCs within tumor
microenvironment
MDSCs are known as tumor-associated suppressor
cells and produce immunosuppression in opposition to
various types of immune cells, including CD4+ T cell,
CD8+ T cell, and NK cells [15, 16]. Thus, we compared
the suppressive function of MDSCs in the spleen and in
the tumor tissue after Tg and/or 4-PBA treatment. MDSCs
isolated from the spleen or from tumors were cocultured
with OT-II peptide-pulsed splenic DCs and CFSE-labeled
OT-II CD4+ T cells to determine T cell activation status.
Despite the increased number of MDSCs in the spleen, we
found no differences in the suppressive function of splenic
MDSCs among vehicle, Tg, and Tg/4-PBA-treated mice
(Figure 5A and 5B). In contrast, tumor-infiltrating MDSCs
showed significantly increased immunosuppressive
function after Tg treatment, as compared with vehicle
treatment (Figure 5A and 5C). Treatment with 4-PBA
significantly inhibited the suppressive function of
tumor-infiltrating MDSCs under ER stress conditions
(Figures 5A and 5C).
Several previous studies suggested that the
immunosuppressive function of MDSCs was partly
mediated by arginase-1 (ARG1) [17], iNOS [17], and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by NOX2
[6, 15, 18]. Therefore, we assessed the transcription
levels of ARG1, iNOS, and NOX2. Although there
were no significant changes in the mRNA levels of
NOX2 and ARG1 in splenic MDSCs among groups,
the expression levels of NOX2, ARG1, and iNOS were
significantly increased in tumor-infiltrating MDSCs after
Tg treatment, as compared with the vehicle control group
(Figures 5D-I). Surprisingly, Tg-induced up-regulation of
ARG1, Nox2, and iNOS in tumor-infiltrating MDSCs was
significantly inhibited by 4-PBA treatment (Figure 5G-I).

DISCUSSION
In the current study, ER stress induced by long-term
Tg treatment of tumor-bearing mice accelerated tumor
growth, as compared with that of vehicle-treated mice.
Relief of ER stress by 4-PBA reduced the tumor growth
to the level observed in non-treated mice. The tumor

microenvironment leads to hypoxia, glucose and amino
acid insufficiency, and ER biosynthesis malfunctioning
[14, 22]. Thus, there must be an elevation of ER stress
and the unfolded protein response within tumor cells, and
tumor-infiltrating cells, including MDSCs, might also be

under ER stress. However, because 4-PBA alone could
not induce tumor regression (Supplementary Figure 6),
we concluded that tumor tissue may possess intrinsic
mechanisms to cope with ER stress in hypoxic conditions,
which mimic the effect of 4-PBA.

How systemic ER stress affects MDSC in vivo?
Enhanced ER stress by Tg treatment increased the number
and the suppressive function of MDSCs whereas reduced
ER stress by 4-PBA treatment significantly reduced
them (Fig 4D-E and supplement Fig 3G). However, Tg
treatment did not increase the proliferation of CT26
tumor cells in vitro (Fig 1F). Therefore, we expected that
ER stress might be able to directly stimulate MDSCs
expansion and enforce their suppressive activity. On the
other hand, the larger tumor had more hypoxic condition
inside the mass than smaller tumor, and consequently can
influence on the further expansion of MDSCs in vivo. Our
results showed that ER stress by Tg did not increase the
proliferation of CT26 cells consistent with several other
reports (Figure 1F). However, recent studies suggested
that ER stress can induce GSK-3β activation  [23], and
their activation plays an important role in the proliferation
of human ovarian and colorectal cancer cells [24, 25].
Therefore, we could not rule out the possibility that
enhanced ER stress could make tumor growth faster,
which could increase the proliferation and suppressive
function of MDSCs.
The immunosuppressive function of MDSCs has
been shown to be dependent on several mechanisms, such
as arginine and cysteine metabolism and reactive oxygen
species generation [18, 22]. The expression of iNOS and
ARG1 in MDSCs has been shown to be especially critical
for the suppression of T cell function in an antigenindependent manner [15, 26]. In addition, HIF-1α induced
under hypoxic conditions was involved in the up-regulation
of iNOS and ARG1 in MDSCs [22]. HIF-1α  induced
proangiogenic factors such as VEGFR1, PDGF-B,
and angiopoietins, and HIF-1α expression in MDSCs,
was associated with immunosuppressive function and
tumor progression [22, 27]. In contrast, splenic MDSCs,
which have high levels of NOX2, increased production
of reactive oxygen species, but failed to suppress
antigen-independent T cell activation [22]. In addition,
differences have been reported in the compositions
of MDSC subsets in the spleen and in tumors [28, 29].
Granulocytic MDSCs in the spleen produce high levels
of ROS via NOX2 [18], whereas up-regulated ARG1 and
iNOS in tumor-infiltrating MDSCs was reported to be
critical for their suppressive function [17]. In the current
study, we found that the level of NOX2 was much higher
in splenic MDSCs than in tumor-infiltrating MDSCs.
However, levels of ARG1 and iNOS were significantly
increased by Tg treatment in tumor-infiltrating MDSCs,
but not in splenic MDSCs. These results suggest that the
expression of ARG1 and iNOS in MDSCs is critical for
their suppressive function, and could be increased by
Tg-mediated ER stress under hypoxic conditions within
tumor tissue, because in MDSCs their expression was
correlated with immunosuppressive capacity against
CD4+ T cells. Recently, we also showed that Myd88, an
adaptor molecule critical for the activation of ARG1 and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NOX2 expression, was critical for the immunosuppressive
function of MDSCs [6].
The induction of ER stress in cancer cells by
oxaliplatin or anthracyclines has been shown to induce
calreticulin (CRT) localization outside the cell membrane,
which mediates immunogenic apoptosis to stimulate
tumor-specific CD8+ T cell responses [30]. Tg treatment
in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) and neuroblastoma
cells stimulated CRT cell surface exposure through
ER Ca2+ depletion, and also promoted phagocytosis of
apoptotic bodies [1]. However, we could not find any
evidence of increased antitumor immune response caused
by systemic administration of Tg. Instead, Tg treatment
accelerated tumor growth as compared to vehicle
treatment. Thus, ER Ca2+ depletion induced by Tg might
not be sufficient to induce antigen presentation, even
though phagocytosis of CRT-exposing apoptotic cancer
cells was increased. To efficiently induce a tumor-specific
CD8+ T cell response, an antigen needs to be presented by
MHC class I molecules after phagocytosis [5]. However,
this process could be hampered by multiple prerequisite
steps for successful antigen presentation. Most importantly,
lysosomal degradation must occur for antigen loading
into the MHC class I pocket. Degradation of intracellular
protein or organelles via lysosomal fusion during
autophagy could increase lysosomal antigen degradation
for MHC class I presentation [31]. Erp57, an ER-resident
thiol disulfide oxidoreductase that forms a complex
with CRT, was recently reported to modulate STAT3
signaling [32]. Because STAT3 activity is negatively
regulated by Erp57 and dependent on the formation
of Erp57-CRT complexes [32], Tg-induced ER stress
might induce Erp57 malfunction by disassociating it with
CRT. A further explanation for enhanced Tg-mediated
tumor growth is its known function as a tumor promoter
in certain circumstances via the Src-MAP kinase
pathway [33], and PI-3 kinase-mediated activation of the
serine/threonine protein kinase protein kinase B (PKB) by
Tg treatment may enhance survival and proliferation of
some cell types [34].
4-PBA has been used for the treatment of urea cycle
disorders in children because of its function as an ammonia
scavenger [35]. In addition, 4-PBA has also been studied
as a potential treatment for several cancers, including
human solid malignant tumors and recurrent malignant
gliomas [36]. The inhibition of histone deacetylation by
4-PBA can repress gene expression, including that of genes
related to tumor suppression, and represents an alternative
treatment for cystic fibrosis [37]. The histone deacetylation
inhibition activity of 4-PBA also resulted in decreased
cancer proliferation [36]. More importantly, the chemical
chaperone function of 4-PBA, which mimics intracellular
protein chaperones and promotes protein folding in the
ER, has been suggested as a means to treat pathological
conditions related to several abnormal protein localization
and aggregation disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease

MATERIALS AND METHODS

[38], amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [39], and lysosomal
storage diseases. Indeed, recent studies showed that ER
stress attenuation by 4-PBA restored glucose homeostasis
in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes and alleviated colitis
in mice [40, 41]. Although in this study we focused
on the function of 4-PBA as a chemical chaperone
to facilitate the correction of unfolded and misfolded
proteins in the ER, tumor regression could be partially
mediated by the inhibitory effect of 4-PBA on histone
deacetylation [42]. Thus, the effect of butyrate on tumor
growth after Tg treatment should be assessed, because
it does not possess chemical chaperone activity, but can
induce histone hyperacetylation by inhibiting histone
deacetylation [43].
Several cytokines secreted by MDSCs inhibit
the function of CTLs [44]. Accordingly, we found that
Tg-mediated ER stress decreased the number and the
activation of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, and 4-PBA
treatment restored these parameters (Figure 6E and 6G)
although the number and the activity of CD4+ T cell and
CD8+ T cells in the spleen and lymph node were not
affected by ER stress (Figure 2). Therefore, we suggest
that ER stress reduction by 4-PBA treatment could
overcome the immunosuppressive environment produced
by MDSCs, particularly in tumors with excessive ER
stress induced by Tg treatment, to restore anti-tumor
immunity nearby tumor mass.
Recent studies showed that ER stress induced by
Tg in prostate cancer cells up-regulated lipocalin 2 in an
NF-κB-dependent manner, because ER stress inhibition
by 4-PBA and NF-κB inhibition by BAY11-7082 inhibited
lipocalin 2 induction [16]. Thus, combination of 4-PBA
with NF-κB inhibitors such as MG132 and BAY11-7082
might reduce ER stress-mediated tumor progression in
our model. As another possible way to reduce ER stress,
we and others have examined the consequences of
activation of autophagy [45, 46]. Autophagy, especially
macroautophagy, is a lysosomal-dependent degradation
pathway that removes unnecessary cytosolic proteins and
organelles, and is activated, at least partly, for the resolution
of ER stress [47]. Several methods of autophagy activation,
including treatment with rapamycin, salubrinal, and
α-mangostin, represent candidates for ER stress reduction
in cancer models via repression of the immunosuppressive
function of MDSCs [45, 48, 49]. In addition, lithium
chloride, a GSK-3β inhibitor, could attenuate Tg-mediated
enhanced tumor growth, because Tg-induced apoptosis
was prevented by GSK-3β inhibition [23].
Collectively, in our study, enhanced ER stress in
tumor-bearing hosts increased tumor growth. Acceleration
of tumor growth by ER stress was mediated by modulating
the levels of ARG1 and iNOS in tumor-infiltrating MDSCs,
which enhanced their immunosuppressive function.
Therefore, ER stress reducers such as 4-PBA could restore
anti-tumor immunity by dampening immunosuppressive
MDSCs that are exacerbated by ER stress.

Mice
All experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Kangwon
National  University. Wild-type BALB/c and C57BL/6
mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories
(Orient Bio Inc., Sungnam, Korea). OVA-specific
OT-II (C57BL/6 background) TCR transgenic mice
were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor,
ME). All mice used in the experiments were purchased
at 6 weeks of age. The mice were kept in the Animal
Center for Pharmaceutical Research at Kangwon National
University. To establish tumors, mice were subcutaneously
(s.c.) injected with 106 tumor cells on the left flank.

Cell line
Human HER2/neu-expressing CT26 cells (hHER2/
CT26) [4, 5, 50] and mouse TC-1 cervical cancer cells
were used as tumor cells in these studies. To establish
tumors, 106 HER2/CT26 or TC-1 tumor cells were injected
s.c. into the left flank of BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice,
respectively. Tumor growth was measured by calipers
3 times per week.

Reagents and antibodies
Mice were treated with 100 μg/kg Tg (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) and 10 mg/kg sodium 4-phenylbutyrate
(Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) every day. All antibodies
used for flow cytometry analysis were purchased from BD
Biosciences (San Jose, CA).

Isolation of tissue-infiltrating MDSCs
To obtain tissue-infiltrating MDSCs, tumor tissue
was gently homogenized with a MACS dissociator
(Miltenyibiotec, Germany) and treated with 0.5 mg/mL
collagenase type IV (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)
for 30 min. Cells were harvested by gentle pipetting and
exposed to a 40–70% percoll gradient to enrich mononuclear
cells. To isolate MDSCs, cells were treated with an antiCD11b+ microbead and isolated by MACS cell separation.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from 106 MDSCs using
the RNA Extraction Mini Kit (iNtRON, Korea).
Reverse transcription was performed using the cDNA
Synthesis Mini Kit (iNtRON), and quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted using
THUNDERBIRD™ SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo, Japan).
The following primers were used:

(103/well), and cocultured with MDSCs (2 × 105/well) for
72 h. CFSE dilutions of OT-II CD4+ T cells were analyzed
using flow cytometry.

Total protein lysates from tumor cells or tissue were
prepared by sonication in lysis buffer (iNtRON). Equal
amounts of lysates were boiled at 100°C and resolved
using 8–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Proteins were transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) that were blocked with 5% milk in
tris-buffered saline and Tween 20 and incubated overnight
with the primary antibody, and proteins were detected with
an horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology). Membranes were developed
by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method using
femtoLUCENT™ PLUS-HRP (G-Biosciences, St. Louis,
MO, USA)

In vivo cytotoxicity assay
The in vivo cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells was
assessed as described previously [6, 51]. Briefly, syngeneic
splenocytes and lymph node (LN) cells were divided
into 2 fractions of equal number that were either loaded
with 1 μg/mL of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope
peptide (human HER2/neu p63 [TYLPTNASL]) or left
unpulsed. Peptide-pulsed cells were labeled with 10 μM
CFSE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and unpulsed cells were
labeled with 1 μM CFSE. Equal numbers of CFSEhigh and
CFSElow cells were mixed and injected intravenously into
mice. After 24 h, the splenocytes from treated mice were
analyzed to assess antigenic peptide-specific target lysis.
The specific lysis was calculated as follows:
r (ratio) = (%CFSElow/%CFSEhigh)
% lysis = (1 - [runprimed /rprimed]) × 100
