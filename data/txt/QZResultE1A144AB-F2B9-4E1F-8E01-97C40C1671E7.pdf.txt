Abstract
In recent years, several molecularly targeted therapies have been approved for clear cell renal cell carcinoma
(ccRCC), a highly aggressive cancer. Although these therapies significantly extend overall survival, nearly all
patients with advanced ccRCC eventually succumb to the disease. To identify other molecular targets, we
profiled gene expression in 90 ccRCC patient specimens for which tumor grade information was available. Gene
set enrichment analysis indicated that cell-cycle–related genes, in particular, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), were
associated with disease aggressiveness. We also carried out RNAi screening to identify kinases and phosphatases
that when inhibited could prevent cell proliferation. As expected, RNAi-mediated knockdown of PLK1 and other
cell-cycle kinases was sufficient to suppress ccRCC cell proliferation. The association of PLK1 in both disease
aggression and in vitro growth prompted us to examine the effects of a small-molecule inhibitor of PLK1, BI 2536,
in ccRCC cell lines. BI 2536 inhibited the proliferation of ccRCC cell lines at concentrations required to inhibit
PLK1 kinase activity, and sustained inhibition of PLK1 by BI 2536 led to dramatic regression of ccRCC xenograft
tumors in vivo. Taken together, these findings highlight PLK1 as a rational therapeutic target for ccRCC. Cancer

Introduction
In 2010, in the United States, an estimated 58,000 people will
be diagnosed with, and 35,000 deaths will be attributed to,
cancers of the kidney and renal pelvis (1). Kidney cancer can
be divided into several histologic subtypes, but the majority of
the cases (about 75%) are of the clear cell renal cell carcinoma
(ccRCC) subtype (2). Surgery offers the best opportunity to
cure localized ccRCC. However, most patients who experience
recurrence after surgery or who have metastatic disease at the
time of diagnosis will ultimately succumb to the disease.
Immunotherapy with agents such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) has
been the only choice for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
patients, with 7-8% of individuals showing complete remission
following treatment (3, 4), but IL-2 is beneficial to only a small
number of patients. New agents such as sunitinib, sorafenib,

and pazopanib, which target the receptor tyrosine kinases of
vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived
growth factor, have recently been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration for ccRCC therapy, but the
responses are usually partial and most patients eventually
experience progression (5, 6). Therapies directed against the
mTOR have also been used to treat advanced disease, but
again most patients have disease progression (7). Thus, there
remains a critical need for effective and specifically targeted
therapies for ccRCC.
Gene expression profiling has been successfully used to find
genes that are differentially expressed among RCC subtypes,
correlated with chromosomal abnormalities, or correlated
with deregulated oncogenic pathways (8–10). However, finding therapeutic targets from those lists of genes is still
challenging. Genes whose expression varies with clinical parameters such as tumor grade, stage, or survival duration may be
more helpful in identifying molecular targets, but they require
additional validation (11, 12).
The discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) and the advance
of technologies for using RNAi on large sets of genes in
mammalian cells—either siRNA or short hairpin RNA
(shRNA)—allow us to systematically interrogate gene functions at high throughput (13–16). Such an approach has
proven successful in the discovery of genes that were components of the p53 tumor-suppressor pathway (13), of genes that
when knocked down sensitize resistant cells to chemotherapeutic agents (15, 16), and of genes essential to the proliferation of human mammary and colon cancer cells (17, 18).

Here, we expand upon previous partial kinase library
screening of ccRCC (19) by examining the effects on cell
proliferation within the whole library of kinases and phosphatases. In addition, we used expression profiling data
carried out on 90 ccRCC samples for which we had tumor
grade information. Combining these results identified a class
of cell-cycle kinases, such as Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), as
potential therapeutic targets for ccRCC.

Materials and Methods
Tissue collection and gene expression profiling
Gene expression profiles from 90 ccRCC tumors and 13
normal kidney samples were produced as previously described
(10, 20). This data has been deposited at the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GSE 17895). The kidney samples were obtained
from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network, and approval
was obtained from the Van Andel Research Institute Institutional Review Board to study the samples. Gene expression
analysis was conducted as previously described (21, 22).
The genes differentially expressed between the weakly
aggressive group of tumors (grades I and II) and the highly
aggressive tumors (grade IV) were identified using the function of the linear model for a series of arrays (lmFit) as stated
in the limma package (23).
For Gene Ontology (GO) gene enrichment analysis, significant GO terms were calculated using the Fisher test (raw P
value) or elim Fisher test (adjusted P value) as stated in the top
GO package (24).
Survival analysis
Gene expression profiles from 179 ccRCC tumors, with
following survival duration after surgery, were used to carry
out survival analysis as previously described (25).
Statistical analysis
For all statistical analyses, values were expressed as mean
 SD, except that the relative gene expression values from
microarrays were expressed as median  median absolute
deviation (MAD; ref. 26). Values were compared using
Student's t-test; P < 0.05 was considered significant.
siRNA library screening and target identification
Custom siRNA human kinase and phosphatase library sets
were designed and synthesized as previously described (15).
Our validation data showed greater than 93% transfection
efficiency in ccRCC cell lines, and this library has been
observed to induce, on average, greater than 80% knockdown
for each mRNA target species in our previously published
study (15) and this article.
786-O cells (WT2 or RC3) were seeded onto 96-well plates at
1,000 cells per well. Twenty-four hours later, 10 mL of siRNA
and lipid (Oligofectamine; Invitrogen) mix was added to each
well. Cell viabilities were analyzed 4 days after transfection
using the CellTiter 96 AQueous assay (MTS assay; Promega).
For proliferation analyses, B-score normalization was
applied to primary screening MTS OD values to eliminate
plate-to-plate variability and well-position effects (26).

Cells and cell culture
The A498, ACHN, Caki-1, and 786-O RCC cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. SN12C
cells were kindly provided by Dr. George Vande Woude (Van
Andel Research Institute). 786-O cells (WT2, VHLþ) and 786-O
cells (RC3, VHL) were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Ohh
(University of Toronto). The cells were maintained in
Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100
mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator
containing 5% CO2 at 37 C.
Viability staining
786-O cells were plated at 2,000 cells per well in a 96-well
plate, and to 4 different wells were added 1 of 4 siRNAs
targeting a single gene. At 24 hours after transfection, the
cells were trypsinized and then transferred to a 6-well plate,
where the cells were cultured for another 8 to 10 days. Finally,
the cells were fixed and stained with 1.5% (w/v) crystal violet
(15).
Cell proliferation assay
Cells were plated under the same conditions as the primary
screening. Twenty-four hours later, cells were either transfected with siRNAs or treated with BI 2536. Cells were further
cultured for another 4 days and then cell proliferation was
assessed using either the MTS assay or the CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent assay (Promega).
Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
Total RNA was isolated from 786-O cells 48 hours after
transfection, followed by reverse transcription to cDNA using
universal primers and a TaqMan Gene Expression Cells-to-CT
kit (Applied Biosystems). The reverse transcriptase PCR (RTPCR) reaction was carried out as previously described (15).
Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were incubated with either 10, 20, or 40 nmol/L BI
2536; 1:1,000 dilution of 0.1 N HCl (vehicle); or were left
treatment naïve for 24 hours. Cell-cycle profiles were determined by flow cytometric analysis as previously described
(27). Nocodazole (0.1 mmol/L) was used as a positive control
for cell-cycle arrest at the G2–M phase.
Immunofluorescence of cultured cells
Cell lines were grown on coverslips (Nunc Lab-Tek II
Chamber Slide) for 24 hours and treated the same as in
cell-cycle analysis. The cells were stained with mouse antia-tubulin antibody (1:500; Sigma) followed by addition of a
Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated (1:200) antibody to mouse IgG.
40 ,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 300 nmol/L) was used
to highlight DNA. Fluorescently labeled cells were visualized
using a confocal or fluorescence microscope.
Cell lysate and Western blotting analysis
Cell lysates were prepared by washing cells with PBS and
then following published methods (28), Western blotting
was conducted as previously described (28), except that the

primary antibody was mouse antiphosphorylated histone H3
(Ser10).
Xenograft models
All animal studies were in compliance with VARI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) policies. Sixweek-old female BALB/c nu/nu nude mice (Charles River)
were given subcutaneous injections of 3  106 786-O, A498,
Caki-1, or SN12C cells in the right flank. Tumor size was
measured as previously described (27).
Tumor growth study
When tumors had grown to an average volume of 200 to 300
mm3, mice were separated into 2 groups of 5 animals. For 1
treatment cycle, 1 group received an intratumoral injection of
BI 2536 either once or twice per day on 2 consecutive days per
week, at a dosage of 50 mg/kg per injection; the vehicle control
group received 0.1 N HCl. The mice received 3 to 4 treatment
cycles before sacrifice.
Target modulation study
When tumors had grown to an average volume of 400 to 500
mm3, tumor-bearing mice were separated into 2 groups of 5
animals. Then, the mice were treated twice on the first day and
once on the following day by intratumoral injection of BI 2536
(50 mg/kg per injection) or of 0.1 N HCl. Six hours after the
third treatment, the mice were sacrificed.
Immunohistochemical staining for phosphorylated histone
H3 (Ser10) was carried out as described (20). Phosphorylated
histone H3 (Ser10) antibody (Cell Signaling) was used at a
dilution of 1:50. The quantification of proliferation index was
also carried out as previously described (20).

Results
Genes associated with aggressive ccRCC
Gene expression profiling was carried out on 90 ccRCC
patient samples for which tumor grade information was
available (Supplementary Table S1). To identify individual
genes whose expression is associated with tumor aggressiveness, we first filtered out genes that did not show much
difference among the patients, using 1.414 (log2 value <0.5)
as the cutoff for interquartile expression levels. This left about
half the genes (9,824/18,185) as candidates for further analysis.
Then, we classified the patients into 2 groups, weakly aggressive (grades I and II) and highly aggressive (grade IV). A linear
model was used to identify genes differentially expressed
between these 2 groups. We identified 1,159 genes as being
significantly associated with aggressiveness when highly
expressed [False Discovery Rate (FDR) <0.2 and fold change
>1; Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S2].
High expression of cell-cycle–related kinases is
associated with tumor aggressiveness
To place the individual genes into biological context, a gene
enrichment analysis approach based on GO was used (29).
When the Biological Process GO categories were examined, 6
out of the top 10 GO terms were associated with the cell cycle,

www.aacrjournals.org

for example, the GO terms "mitosis" (GO:0007067, raw P ¼
4.30  1013, adjusted P ¼ 4.30  1013) and "cell-cycle
phase" (GO:0022403, raw P ¼ 1.60  1013, adjusted P ¼
0.024; Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Fig. S1).
The GO term "cell cycle" (GO:0007049) was the highest level
of parent node for these 6 related significant nodes, and it
was itself also significantly related to aggressiveness (raw
P ¼ 2.3  1012, adjusted P ¼ 0.11; Supplmentary Fig. S1
and Supplementary Table S3). Within the GO term "cell
cycle," 117 genes were identified as being associated with
aggressiveness, representing 10.1% (117/1,159) of the aggressiveness-related genes (Fig. 1A). Thus, genes associated
with the cell cycle were strongly associated with ccRCC
aggressiveness.
When the analysis was conducted using the Molecular
Function GO categories, one of the significant related nodes
was the GO term "kinase activity" (GO:0016301; raw P ¼ 4.14 
103, adjusted P ¼ 0.19), which is the parent node of GO terms
of "protein kinase activity" (GO:0004672, P ¼ 5.97  103,
adjusted P ¼ 0.38) and "protein serine/threonine kinase
activity" (GO:0004674, raw P ¼ 3.35  103, adjusted P ¼
3.35  103). Another significant enriched GO term was "ATP
binding" (GO:0005524, raw P ¼ 3.61  103; adjusted P ¼ 4.30
 103), which includes 661 kinases (Supplementary Table S4
and Supplementary Fig. S2). Seventy-two genes in the GO term
"kinase activity" were identified as being associated with
aggressiveness, representing 6.21% (72/1,159) of the aggressiveness-related genes (Fig. 1A). These results highlight the
importance of kinases in ccRCC aggressiveness.
There was an overlap of 101 genes between the "cell cycle"
and the "kinase activity" GO terms. Of the overlapped genes,
19.8% (20/101) were significantly related with disease aggressiveness, and 85% (17/20) of those were serine/threonine
kinases (Supplementary Fig. S3). In particular, PLK1, Aurora
kinase B (AURKB), and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) are
3 representatives of these 20 cell-cycle–related kinases (CCRK;
Fig. 1B). The significance of these kinases is supported by
patient survival analysis using another cohort of 179 patients
(Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S4).
Importance of cell-cycle kinases for ccRCC cell line
proliferation in vitro
We used a cell-based assay to identify genes that were
essential to ccRCC cell proliferation, and we carried out a
high-throughput siRNA screen targeting the whole kinome and
phosphatome using an isogenic pair of ccRCC cell lines, 786-O
(RC3, VHL) and 786-O (WT2, VHLþ; ref. 30), trying to find
targets specific required for VHL-mutated cell proliferation.
Each cell line was transfected with 4 unique siRNA duplexes
targeting each of 678 known and putative kinases and 198
known and putative phosphatases in a 1-gene/1-well format on
96-well microtiter plates. The transfection efficiency was
greater than 93% (Supplementary Fig. S5). At 96 hours after
transfection, cell proliferation was measured using an MTS
assay, which measures the activity of reductase enzymes
in living cells (31). Raw absorbance values were normalized
to internal reference control samples on each plate to permit
plate-to-plate comparisons, and each well was assigned a

Figure 1. Increased expression of CCRK is associated with advanced ccRCC. A, schematic showing the gene selection criteria to identify classes
of genes associated with high-grade ccRCC. On the basis of gene expression profiling data, genes that were upregulated in ccRCC relative to

B-score after normalization of the position effects (26).
Although we started with the idea of finding synthetic lethal
genes, we did not find such targets except for the genes which
have been reported before (19). Next, we used the average Bscore from these 2 cell lines to choose positive hits regardless of
VHL status (Supplementary Table S5).
In this screen, siRNAs having an average B-score of less than
3 were defined as proliferation genes for ccRCC (Fig. 2A).
Overall, we identified 35 kinases, including PLK1, nonmetastatic cells 3 (NME3), CCRK, NAD kinase (NADK), and
PCTAIRE protein kinase 3 (PCTK3), as well as 2 phosphatases,
protein phosphatase 1 regulatory (inhibitor) subunit 3F
(PPP1R3F) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2). To get a functional overview of these
data, the genes were classified according to function; the
majority of hits were metabolic and cell-cycle kinases and
phosphatases (Fig. 2B).
A subset of these genes was selected for further study. To
rule out potential off-target and cell line effects of the siRNA
screen, each gene was targeted with 4 different siRNAs indi-

vidually in the 786-O, A498, ACHN, Caki-1, and SN12C cell
lines. To rule out potential assay effects, proliferation rates
were measured by quantitation of ATP levels (CellTiter-Glo)
rather than by reductase activity (32). All ccRCC cell lines
showed a similar requirement, regardless of VHL status, for
the NME3, PLK1, CCRK, NADK, PCTK3, deoxyguanosine kinase
(DGUOK), and glucokinase (GCK) genes for cell survival in vitro
(Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S6A).
To confirm these results, 786-O cells were transfected with 4
siRNAs individually targeting 1 of 5 different kinases. The cells
were transferred to 6-well plates and allowed to grow for 8 to
10 days and then were stained with crystal violet to visualize
the relative number of cell colonies (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S6B). At the same time, the mRNA levels for the
kinases were measured using quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) following knockdown by single siRNAs (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S6C). The results were consistent, showing that the
effective siRNAs were targeting their specific targets and that a
decrease of candidate gene expression was associated with
decreased cell proliferation. In summary, we identified 37

Figure 2. siRNA screen to identify kinases and phosphatases important for ccRCC proliferation. A, 786-O (RC3, VHL) and 786-O (WT2, VHLþ) cells
were transfected with siRNAs directed against known and putative human phosphastases (n ¼ 198) and kinases (n ¼ 678). Cells were incubated for
96 hours and proliferation was measured using the MTS assay. The B-score for each siRNA is plotted (see Materials and Methods). The top 37 genes
are shown in light grey. B, The 37 top genes are classified by their known functions (left), and the B-scores for groups with more than 4 genes are graphed;
the median B-score is indicated by the bar. C, proliferation of human ccRCC cell lines was measured using a CellTiter-Glo assay with a nonsilencing
scrambled siRNA control (S) and 4 different siRNA duplexes (1, 2, 3, and 4) targeting the indicated gene. The relative numbers of cells were normalized
to lipid-only controls (not plotted). *, P < 0.05. D, 786-O cell proliferation was measured 8 to 10 days after the introduction of a lipid-only control
(C), a nonsilencing scrambled control (S), or an siRNA duplex (1, 2, 3, or 4) targeting the indicated gene. Cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet.
E, 786-O cells were treated as in D. After 48 hours, total RNA was isolated, and primers were designed to specifically amplify the indicated genes.
Q-PCR reactions used TaqMan Gene Expression assays and the comparative Ct method for relative expression. The data were normalized to the expression
of nonsilencing scrambled siRNA controls (S).

genes, including PLK1, that are important to ccRCC cell line

Inhibition of PLK1 function suppresses ccRCC cell
proliferation in vitro
The combined results of the aggressiveness analysis and the
cell line proliferation screening indicated that cell-cycle–
related genes were important to both disease progression
and cell proliferation. Specifically, we found that 3 kinases
(AURKB, PLK1, and JAK3) were identified in both data sets

www.aacrjournals.org

(Supplementary Fig. S7). We previously examined the role of
the Aurora kinases in ccRCC, showing that inhibition of this
class of kinases suppresses the growth of ccRCC (25). Here, we
used the small-molecule inhibitor of PLK1, BI 2536, which has
recently become available, to examine the effects of PLK1
inhibition on ccRCC. The cell lines 786-O, A498, ACHN, Caki-1,
and SN12C were treated for 96 hours with concentrations of BI
2536 from 5 to 80 nmol/L (Fig. 3A). These concentrations were
previously reported to inhibit PLK1 kinase activity in vitro (33,
34). BI 2536 suppressed the proliferation of the ccRCC cell

Figure 3. Inhibition of PLK1 by the drug BI 2536 suppresses in vitro cell proliferation. A, the indicated ccRCC-derived cell lines were treated with BI 2536
for 96 hours, and proliferation was measured using the CellTiter-Glo assay. At least 3 experiments were run, each in triplicate. Results are expressed
as a percentage of the proliferation of control cells treated with vehicle (1:1,000 dilution of 0.1 N HCl in medium). B, effects of BI 2536 on cell-cycle
distribution. The cells were treated with medium alone (control); a 1:1,000 dilution of 0.1 N HCl in medium (buffer); 10, 20, or 40 nmol/L BI 2536; or nocodazole
(0.1 mmol/L) for 24 hours. *, P < 0.05. C, BI 2536 induced an M-phase block. Control, buffer, and BI 2536 treatments were as in B; other treatments were
medium with only 0.1% FBS (Starve); 1 mmol/L hydroxyurea (Hydr); or 0.5 mmol/L aphidicolin (Aph) for 24 hours. The positive control for phosphorylated
histone H3 was 0.1 mmol/L nocodazole (Noc). D, effects of BI 2536 on chromosome alignment. Cells were treated as in B but without nocodazole. Cell
response was analyzed by confocal imaging following staining for a-tubulin (red) and DNA (blue). The photos show images of the aberrant alignment of
chromosomes ("Polo") after treatment with 40 nmol/L BI 2536. Scale bars, 5 mm. The graph shows the percentage of cells with aberrant chromosome
alignment relative to all of the M-phase cells in each treatment. All error bars are standard deviations from 3 independent experiments.

lines in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 2 to 20
nmol/L, which are consistent with the values found for other
cell lines (33, 34).
PLK1 has been shown to be critical for mitotic entry,
centrosome maturation, and cytokinesis (35). The loss of
PLK1 function (via either knockdown or small-molecule inhibitors) results in a metaphase block in which cells fail to
assemble a functional bipolar spindle; instead, mitotic chromosomes become arranged in a circular fashion around a
monopolar spindle, termed a "Polo" spindle (33, 35, 36). To
confirm that BI 2536 was inhibiting PLK1 function at concentrations that inhibited in vitro proliferation, cells were

treated for 24 hours with 10, 20, or 40 nmol/L BI 2536, stained
with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flowcytometry for
effects on the cell cycle (Fig. 3B). Cells treated with nocodazole
were used as a control population blocked at G2–M phase.
As expected, the cells treated with BI 2536 accumulated at
G2–M, which is consistent with the function of PLK1 in early
mitotic entry. Sustained evidence indicates that the level of
histone H3 phosphorylated on serine 10 (pH3) correlates with
proliferation rate and that the intracellular pattern of pH3
staining differentiates between stages of mitosis (37), so next
we examined both pH3 levels and the chromosome orientation. Compared with either nontreated or buffer controls, BI

Figure 4. Inhibition of PLK1 by BI 2536 suppressed in vivo tumor growth. A, BI 2536 inhibited the growth of 786-O xenograft tumors. When xenograft tumors
were 200 to 300 mm3, they were treated with vehicle (0.1 N HCl, filled squares) or 50 mg/kg BI 2536 (empty triangles) by intratumoral injection (arrows). The
treatment cycle was 1 injection per day for 2 consecutive days each week for 2 weeks; it then changed to 2 injections per day for 2 consecutive days each week
for another 3 weeks. B, BI 2536 treatment at 2 injections per day for 2 consecutive days inhibited the growth of A498 xenograft tumors. C, when 786-O tumors
were 400 to 500 mm3, they were injected (intratumorally) either with vehicle control (0.1 N HCl) or 50 mg/kg BI 2536 3 times, twice the first day and once the
following day. The treated tumor tissues were excised 6 hours after the final injection, and either immunostained with antibodies to the mitotic marker
phosphorylated histone H3 or stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Cells with aberrant alignment chromosomes are indicated by arrows. Scale bars, 20
mm. Boxes at the lower left of the bottom images are enlargements of the small box in each image. D, mitotic cells (as described in C) positive for
phosphorylated histone H3, were calculated using 5 fields from each of 3 separate tumors. **, P < 0.01.

2536-treated cells had increased levels of pH3, reaching the
level found in cells treated with nocodazole (Fig. 3C). Cells
were also stained with a-tubulin, followed by secondary antibody conjugated with Rhodamine Red-X, and chromosomes
were visualized with DAPI. Confocal images of the cells
treated with BI 2536 showed the Polo chromosomal phenotype. The number of cells with the Polo phenotype was
substantially increased in the BI 2536 treatment group relative
to controls, indicating that the inhibition of PLK1 function
results in an M-phase block that is associated with decreased
cellular proliferation (Fig. 3D).
Sustained inhibition of PLK1 function inhibits ccRCC
tumor growth in vivo
786-O, A498, Caki-1, or SN12C cells were subcutaneously
implanted in nude mice and treated with BI 2536. Following
the published literature (34), we initially used intravenous
injection of 50 mg/kg BI 2536 and a "2 days on, 5 days off"
weekly dosing schedule; we observed only minor inhibition
effects on Caki-1 and SN12C xenograft tumors and no effects
on 786-O and A498 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S8).
Then, we used the same treatment schedule, but we applied
BI 2536 to 786-O xenografts by intratumoral injection. Under

5232

this protocol, tumors were allowed to grow to 200 mm3,
and then 50 mg/kg BI 2536 was injected intratumorally
according to the dosing schedule. After 2 cycles of treatment,
no effect on tumor growth was observed. We speculated that
the tumor was not responsive because of the incomplete
inhibition of PLK1 function. Thus, in subsequent treatments,
50 mg/kg of BI 2536 was injected twice a day (100 mg/kg total
per day), once at 7:00 AM and then at 5:00 PM, for 2
consecutive days in a week. Somewhat surprisingly, the
tumors significantly regressed upon this BI 2536 treatment
(Fig. 4A), and we repeatedly observed similar effects on both
786-O (data not shown) and A498 ccRCC xenografts (Fig. 4B).
To confirm that BI 2536 inhibited PLK1 function using the
twice-a-day schedule in vivo, a target modulation study was
carried out. 786-O cells were subcutaneously implanted in
nude mice, tumors were allowed to grow to 400 to 500 mm3,
and then the mice were treated by intratumoral injection 3
times, twice in the first day and once in the following day,
using 50 mg/kg BI 2536 per injection. The mice were sacrificed
6 hours after the final injection. The tumor tissues were
collected and examined for pH3 and for chromosome alignment (Fig. 4C and D). Compared with the vehicle control
group, pH3 and aberrations in chromosome alignment were

Inhibition of PLK1 Suppressed the Growth of ccRCC

increased in BI 2536-treated cells. Together, these results
showed that sustained inhibition of the PLK1 function in vivo
by BI 2536 can suppress ccRCC tumor growth.

Discussion
This study integrated both gene expression profiling and
RNAi screening data to identify genes involved in ccRCC
development and progression. Consistent with cancer being
a disease of uncontrolled proliferation, we found an enrichment of cell-cycle–related processes when genes associated
with tumor grade were examined for deregulated biological
pathways. However, the appearance of kinase-related genes in
the molecular function analysis was not initially expected,
because ccRCC renal tumors have not been reported to
contain specific kinase-associated pathway activation induced
by either gene mutation or focal amplification (33, 38, 39).
On the basis of the gene expression results and the generation of several potent small-molecule kinase inhibitors, we
carried out an RNAi screen to identify kinases and phosphatases that were required for the growth of ccRCC cell lines.
Both our expression analysis and our siRNA proliferation
screen highlighted the importance of cell-cycle–related genes
like PLK1 and AURKB in ccRCC. PLK1 is a serine–threonine
kinase that plays a key role in mitotic entry, centrosome
maturation, and cytokinesis (35). Consistent with our finding
that PLK1 is overexpressed in high-grade kidney cancers,
PLK1 has been found overexpressed in many other solid
tumor types (40), including breast cancer (41) and colorectal
cancer (42). As we report here for ccRCC, preclinical studies
have also shown promising results in other solid cancers,
including breast cancer and colorectal cancer (34, 43), by
either knocking down PLK1 via siRNA/shRNA or inhibiting
PLK1 function via small-molecular inhibitors. Several PLK1
inhibitors have been evaluated or ongoing against solid
tumors in the clinical setting (44, 45). Our data reported here
and previously (25) clearly show that inhibition of PLK1 or
AURKB function can suppress ccRCC tumor growth both

in vitro and in vivo. However, one of the most notable results
of this work was that a twice-a-day schedule is required for the
in vivo effects of BI 2536. This result may indicate that for cellcycle kinase inhibitors to cause ccRCC tumor regression, the
function of the kinases needs to be inhibited for a longer
duration than is needed by, for example, receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitors. We speculate that to induce cell death or
apoptosis in ccRCC, the function of PLK1 needs to be suppressed for a certain period, highlighting the need for careful
selection of delivery schedules for this class of drugs in clinical
trials for ccRCC.
We also indentified a series of proliferation genes for ccRCC;
in particular, NME3 (also known as DR-nm23) seemed to
potently suppress the growth of these cells when knocked
down. NME3 belongs to the nm23 gene family having a
common nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity (46). NME3
has been shown to either inhibit or promote cell differentiation or apoptosis when highly expressed in different cell types
(47). Genes from the same family have been shown to be
closely related to metastasis (48). Whether the kinase activity
of NME3 is required for ccRCC cell proliferation could be a
fruitful area for further study.
