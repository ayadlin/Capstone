Abstract
Breast cancer stem–like cells (BCSC) have been implicated in tumor growth, metastasis, drug resistance, and
relapse but druggable targets in appropriate subsets of this cell population have yet to be identiﬁed. Here we identify
a fundamental role for the prolyl isomerase Pin1 in driving BCSC expansion, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity,
deﬁning it as a key target of miR200c, which is known to be a critical regulator in BCSC. Pin1 overexpression
expanded the growth and tumorigenicity of BCSC and triggered epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Conversely,
genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Pin1 reduced the abundance and self-renewal activity of BCSC. Moreover,
moderate overexpression of miR200c-resistant Pin1 rescued the BCSC defect in miR200c-expressing cells. Genetic
deletion of Pin1 also decreased the abundance and repopulating capability of normal mouse mammary stem cells.
In human cells, freshly isolated from reduction mammoplasty tissues, Pin1 overexpression endowed BCSC traits to
normal breast epithelial cells, expanding both luminal and basal/myoepithelial lineages in these cells. In contrast,
Pin1 silencing in primary breast cancer cells freshly isolated from clinical samples inhibited the expansion,
self-renewal activity, and tumorigenesis of BCSC in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our work demonstrated that Pin1 is a
pivotal regulator acting downstream of miR200c to drive BCSC and breast tumorigenicity, highlighting a new
therapeutic target to eradicate BCSC. Cancer Res; 74(13); 3603–16. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related
death in women in the United States, and most deaths are
because of cancer metastasis or recurrence. Although cells in a
tumor have traditionally been regarded to be biologically
homogenous and highly proliferative, it has become evident
that breast cancer is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous
disease (1, 2). Recent studies suggest that breast cancers follow
the cancer stem cell model (2), although the topic is of
considerable controversy. In this model, cancer is hierarchically organized into tumorigenic and nontumorigenic components, and only a limited, although not necessarily small,
number of cancer stem–like cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating
cells (TIC) can proliferate extensively and give rise to both

more CSCs as well as nontumorigenic cancer cells (2). Breast
cancer stem–like cells (BCSC) are thought to be responsible for
tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, relapse, and drug
resistance (2, 3). Thus, the elucidation of regulatory mechanisms of BCSCs and identiﬁcation of druggable targets to
eradicate the BCSC compartment in a tumor may be essential
to achieve long-term remission of breast cancer (3).
Recently, microRNAs (miRNA) have been identiﬁed as major
regulators of BCSCs (4, 5). Notably, miR200c is downregulated
in cancers (6) and strongly inhibits the function of both BCSC
and normal stem cells (4). Moreover, miR200c has further been
shown to regulate the BCSC stemness and EMT via the
downstream transcription factors Bmi1 and Zeb1/Zeb2
(4, 7, 8). However, so far nothing is known whether miR200c
would have any effects on the regulators of upstream signal
pathways in BCSCs.
Protein phosphorylation on certain serine or threonine
residues preceding a proline (pSer/Thr-Pro) is a central signaling mechanism in diverse cellular processes, especially cell
proliferation and transformation (9). We have previously
shown that certain pSer/Thr-Pro motifs exist in two distinct
conformations, cis and trans, and identiﬁed a unique prolyl
isomerase Pin1, which binds to and catalyzes cis/trans isomerization of speciﬁc pSer/Thr-Pro motifs, catalytically inducing
conformational changes following phosphorylation (10). Such
conformational changes can have profound effects on phosphorylation signaling by regulating a spectrum of Pin1 substrate activities, thereby playing an important role in many
cellular events (10). Importantly, Pin1 is tightly regulated

normally at multiple levels and its deregulation contributes to
the pathogenesis of human disease, notably cancer (10).
Pin1 is overexpressed and/or activated in human cancers,
including breast cancer, with upregulation being correlated
with poor prognosis (11, 12). In contrast, the Pin1 polymorphism that reduces Pin1 expression is associated with reduced
risk for multiple cancers including human breast cancer (13,
14). Pin1 activates numerous oncogenes and also inactivates
many tumor suppressors (10, 15). Notably, although Pin1
overexpression causes cell transformation and tumorigenesis,
Pin1 knockdown (KD) inhibits breast cancer cell growth in
vitro and in vivo (16, 17). Pin1 knockout (KO) mice fail to
undergo massive mammary hyperplasia during pregnancy,
and develop widespread premature aging phenotypes (18,
19). Moreover, these mice are fully resistant to breast
tumorigenesis induced by overexpressing oncogenes, such as
MMTV-Neu/ErbB2 or -Ras (20). Thus, Pin1 is pivotal for the
development of breast cancer. However, although Pin1 has
been shown to increase protein stability of Nanog in embryonic
stem cells (21) and Oct4 in induced pluripotent stem cells (22),
so far little is known about its role in BCSCs.
In this article, we show that as an important target of
miR200c, Pin1 plays a pivotal role in driving human BCSCs
and tumorigenesis as well as regulating normal mouse mammary stem cells (MaSC). The clinical signiﬁcance of these novel
ﬁndings are further substantiated in human primary normal
and cancerous breast tissues by the demonstrations that Pin1
overexpression endows BCSC traits to normal breast epithelial
cells, whereas Pin1 knockdown potently inhibits the expansion
and tumorigenesis of BCSCs in vitro and in vivo. These results
have not only provided novel insight into breast cancer development, but also might have novel therapeutic implications
because Pin1 inhibitors, which are being developed actively,
might be used to overcome cancer resistance to current
therapies.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Pin1 KO mice are in the C57/BL6J background. As Pin1þ/
heterozygous mice are indistinguishable from Pin1þ/þ mice,
we focused on the phenotypes on Pin1/ mice (19). All
studies involving mice were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center and performed in accordance with the
relevant protocol.
Cell culture
The immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMLE)
and the transformed cells (HMLE-Ras) were kindly provided by
Dr. R.A. Weinberg (Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Cambridge, MA), and maintained as described (1). MCF10A
mammary epithelial cells (MEC) were cultured as previously
described (2). For PiB treatment, cells were exposed to 1 mmol/L
PiB for 3 days. Freshly sorted primary mouse MECs were
cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL
of EGF, 10 mg/mL of insulin, 0.5 mg/mL of hydrocortisone, 1%
bovine serum albumin, and 2% calf serum (3). Freshly isolated

3604

Cancer Res; 74(13) July 1, 2014

primary normal human MEC or breast cancer cells were cultured in MEGM with supplements (4).
Generation of stable cell lines
For overexpression, Pin1 CDS were subcloned into the
pBabe retroviral vector or pBybe lentiviral vector. Speciﬁc
point mutations were introduced using the Quickchange Kit
(Stratagene) and sequences were veriﬁed. All lentiviral shRNA
constructs were provided by Dr. W.C. Hahn, Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, Boston, MA. The production of retroviruses
or lentiviruses as well as the infection of target cells was
described previously (5). Following infection, the cells were
selected using hygromycin or puromycin. Cells were used
immediately following selection and for up to 3 weeks after
selection. Fresh stable cell lines were made before each group
of experiments and experiments were performed following at
least two separate infections.
miRNA-related analysis
Total RNA was isolated from miRNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and
reversely transcribed by miScript PCR Starter Kit. Qiagen's
miScript PCR system was used to detect miR200c and
miR15a transcription. miR200c was cloned into pLVX-puro
(Clonetech) for inducible expression. Cells were exposed to
doxycline at ﬁnal concentration of 4 mg/mL to induce
miR200c expression.
In vitro miRNA binding assay was performed as described
(23). In short, Bluescript plasmid containing the Pin1 30
untranslated region (UTR) was used as template in PCR.
Forward primer located at the vector. Reverse primer is from
the DNA sequence of miR200c. The parameters for the PCR
reaction were: 1 cycle at 95 C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles at 95 C
for 1 minutes, 37 C for 1 minutes, 72 C for 1 minutes; and a
ﬁnal elongation step at 72 C for 10 minutes. The PCR products
were then visualized with a 1.5% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide.
For the reporter assay of Pin1 30 UTR by miR200c, wild-type
(WT) and mutant Pin1 30 UTR was cloned into a luciferase
construct psiCHECK2 (Promega). Cells were harvested and
luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega).
Flow cytometry and the ALDEFLUOR assay
Freshly isolated mouse mammary cells were incubated with
biotinylated anti-CD31, CD45, and Ter119 cocktail and the
labeled Linþ cells were removed by EasySep magnet (StemCell
Technologies). The Lin cells were incubated with ﬂuorescence-conjugated antibodies, including CD24-PE, CD29-APC,
and CD49f-FITC antibodies (all from Biolegend), as described
(24, 25). For human cell lines, CD24-PE and CD44-APC antibodies (eBioscience) were used to fractionate the BCSCenriched population, as described (26). Isotype antibodies were
used as negative controls. Sorting for BCSCs freshly isolated
from human breast cancers was performed with Epics Altra
ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). To deplete nontumor cells
from primary cancer samples, a cocktail of lineage marker
antibodies including CD2, CD3, CD10, CD16, CD18, CD31,
CD64, and CD140b (PharMingen) were used, whereas to

deplete nontumor cells from mouse specimens, anti-H2 Kd
antibody was used.
The ALDEFLUOR Kit (StemCell Technologies) was used to
isolate the population with a high ALDH enzymatic activity, as
described (27). As negative control, for each sample of cells an
aliquot was treated with a speciﬁc ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB).
Cleared fat pad transplantation
Fresh Lin MECs from Pin1 KO and WT mice were isolated
and injected into cleared inguinal fat pads of 3-week-old syngeneic mice at limiting dilutions (28). Ten weeks after transplantation mammary glands were harvested and processed for
whole mount staining. An outgrowth is deﬁned as a branched
structure comprising multiple ducts emanating from a central
point, with lobules and terminal end buds (24, 25).
Primary human specimens
All studies involving human subjects were approved by the
Institutional Review Board at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center or Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, and performed in
accordance with the relevant protocol. Normal tissues were from
two cases of reduction mammoplasty. Tumors were from surgical resections of 8 patients with breast carcinomas (Supplementary Table). All patients received no treatment before
surgery.
Tumor implantation and serial transplantation assay
Aliquots of indicated numbers of HMLER cells were injected
into 5-week-old BALB/c nude mice (Jackson Laboratories), as
described (28). The tumor incidence was monitored by palpation and determined at 2 months after injection, with the same
tumor incidence at 6 months postinjection. After tumors were
detected, tumor size was measured every 3 days.
LinCD24CD44þ cells were sorted from eight breast cancer specimens and cultured as single cell suspension in ultralow attachment dishes, and then infected with lentivirus
expressing control vector or Pin1 shRNA. After puromycin
selection, 2,000 transduced cells from each patient were
injected into the mammary fat pads of 5-week-old nude mice.
For serial passaging, cells from the primary tumors were sorted
again for LinCD24CD44þ cells. Among the six primary
tumors formed in the shCtrl group, four tumors were randomly
selected and passaged into 8 mice (two mice per tumor). For
the one tumor formed from shPin1 cells, tumor cells were
injected into 8 mice for serial passaging. The same procedure
was applied to the second passage of xenograft cells. The size of
tumors was measured every 3 days by calipers, and tumor
volumes were calculated as volume (mm3) ¼ L  W2  0.4, as
described (5).
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as the mean  SD, followed by
determining signiﬁcant differences using the 2-tailed t test or
ANOVA test. Limiting dilution data were analyzed by the
single-hit Poisson model using a complementary log–log generalized linear model (29) with L-Calc Software (Stemcell
Technologies). All tests of signiﬁcance were set at P < 0.05.

Results
Pin1 is a major miR200c downstream target in regulating
BCSCs
miR200c has been reported to regulate the self-renewal and
tumorigenicity of BCSCs (4). Interestingly, we found Pin1 might
be a potential target for miR200c, by using the miRNA target
prediction programs PicTar (30) and TargetScan (31) to search
for miRNA binding sites in the Pin1 mRNA sequence. We found
evolutionarily highly conserved binding sites for miR200c in
the 30 UTR of Pin1 (Fig. 1A), suggesting a possible biologic
signiﬁcance. To test if miR200c would indeed target Pin1, we
ﬁrst performed a PCR-based miRNA binding assay, as
described (23). We found that miR200c bound to Pin1 30 UTR
and generated expected PCR products of about 100 bp, whereas miR15a, a control miRNA that is not expected to bind to Pin1
30 UTR, did not produce any PCR products (Fig. 1B). Regulation
of Pin1 by miR200c was further evaluated by luciferase reporter
assay, as described (4). Luciferase constructs bearing wild-type
or mutated miR200c binding site of Pin1 30 UTR were cotransfected with miR200c expression construct. We observed that
miR200c suppressed the luciferase activity of the vector with
wild-type Pin1 30 UTR by about 50%, whereas mutation of
miR200c seed region in Pin1 30 UTR abolished the regulating
effects of miR200c on Pin1 30 UTR (Fig. 1C). A random fragment
of E-cadherin coding region of approximately 500 bp containing no miR200c binding site was cloned into luciferase construct to serve as control.
To conﬁrm that miR200c indeed regulates Pin1 expression,
we generated tetracycline-inducible miR200c-expressing lentiviruses, followed by stable infection of immortalized human
breast epithelial HMLE cells and breast cancer cell lines BT474
and MCF7. The expression of miR200c with or without the
inducer doxycycline was conﬁrmed by RT-PCR, with miR15a
being using as a control (Fig. 1D). Protein expression of Pin1
was monitored together with BMI1 and E-cadherin, which are
downstream molecules of miR200c (4, 8), by Western blot
analysis. Both Pin1 and BMI1 level decreased whereas Ecadherin expression increased speciﬁcally after the induction
of miR200c by doxycycline treatment (Fig. 1E). These results
together indicate that Pin1 is indeed a miR200c downstream
target.
Given that miR200c regulates BCSCs (4), we next examined
whether Pin1 is a key mediator for miR200c in this function. We
stably and moderately overexpressed a miR200c-resistant Pin1
coding sequence using a retroviral construct in HMLE cells
that already stably expressed tetracycline-inducible miR200c.
As expected, induction of miR200c expression by addition of
tetracycline reduced BCSC-enriched CD24CD44þ population
by 10 folds and mammosphere formation, a property associated with mammary stem cells, by about 50%. These stem cell
phenotypes were fully restored by expression of miR200cresistant Pin1 (Fig. 1F and G). Moreover, miR200c expression
in Pin1 KD cells could not further decrease CD24CD44þ
population or mammosphere forming capacity, suggesting
that Pin1 is a functionally critical target of miR200c for
conferring stem cell traits. Thus, Pin1 is a key miR200c downstream gene in regulating BCSCs.

Figure 1. Pin1 is a major miR200c target in regulating BCSCs. A, bioinformatic analyses point to Pin1 as a promising target of miR200c. The seed-pairing
target sites of miR200c within the 30 UTR of Pin1 are evolutionarily conserved across mammals as highlighted. Capitalized letters are conserved binding
nucleotides that directly interact with miR200c. B, miR200c binds to the Pin1 30 UTR. In vitro miRNA binding assay showed that miR200c binds to
Pin1 30 UTR, forming a PCR product of the expected size, whereas control miR15a does not generate any visible products. C, miR200c reduces expression
of the Pin1 30 UTR. Luciferase constructs bearing an unrelated fragment (Control), Pin1 30 UTR (WT), or Pin1 30 UTR containing mutated binding site of
miR200c (Mut) were cotransfected with miR200c. Results showed that miR200c reduces luciferase activity by 50%, but its inhibition was abolished when
miR200c binding site on Pin1 30 UTR was mutated. D, tetracycline-inducible miR200c expression in HMLE, BT474, and MCF7 cells. Cells were stably infected
with lentiviruses expressing tetracycline-inducible miR200c, followed by conﬁrmation of miR200c expression using RT-PCR after doxycycline treatment for
48 hours. Expression of miR15a was monitored to serve as a control. E, inducible miR200c expression downregulates Pin1 and BMI1 expression, but
upregulates E-cadherin expression, as detected by immunoblotting analysis. Actin served as loading control. F and G, Pin1 is a major miR200c target in
BCSCs. Expression of miR200c-resistant Pin1 fully rescues the ability of inducible miR200c expression to inhibit the mammosphere-forming capability (F) and

forming capability (F) and reduces the CD24 CD44 population (G) in HMLE cells, and these effects remain the same when the two are combined together,
indicating that they both act in the same pathway. In all panels, bar graphs present mean  SD of three independent experiments.

Pin1 overexpression potently drives the expansion and
tumorigenicity of BCSCs
We have previously shown that Pin1 is commonly overexpressed in human breast cancer tissues and cell lines (11, 12).
To directly examine the role of Pin1 in BCSCs, we ﬁrst carried
out gain-of-function experiments in HMLEs, which have been
immortalized by serial transfection with hTERT and SV40 (32)

and widely used to study BCSCs. We stably infected HMLE cells
with retroviruses expressing Pin1, which moderately overexpressed Pin1 at 2 to 3 times above the endogenous level in
HMLE cells (Fig. 2A). Compared to HMLEs expressing empty
vector, Pin1-overexpressing cells formed more and bigger
mammospheres (Fig. 2B and C). Moreover, Pin1 overexpression drastically increased the population of BCSC-enriched

Transformed HMLE (HMLE-Ras)
cells stably infected with control
vector and Pin1 were injected into
subcutaneous sites of nude mice in
limiting dilutions. Two months
later, mice were sacriﬁced and
evaluated for tumor weight (F) and
frequency (G). Pin1overexpressing HMLE-Ras cells
exhibited signiﬁcantly much higher
tumor incidence and grew much
faster than control cells. In all
panels, error bars represent SD.

CD24CD44þ cells by 8 to 9 folds above that of the vector
control infected HMLE cells (Fig. 2D and E). To conﬁrm the
BCSC properties of the CD24CD44þ population in Pin1expressing HMLE cells, we sorted the CD24CD44þ and
non-CD24CD44þ fractions from Pin1-expressing HMLE cells.
The CD24CD44þ cells formed mammospheres efﬁciently,
whereas the non-CD24CD44þ fraction barely formed mammospheres (data not shown). Importantly, the promoting
effects of Pin1 on BCSCs were dependent upon its prolyl
isomerase function because the Pin1 point mutants either in
the WW domain (W34A) or the PPIase domain (K63A), which
cannot bind to or isomerize pSer/Thr-Pro motifs, respectively
(17), failed to increase the mammosphere formation or the
CD24CD44þ population (Fig. 2B–E), as shown for many other
known Pin1 cellular functions (10). Thus, moderate Pin1 overexpression in HMLE cells results in enrichment of cells with
BCSC properties.
To assess whether the gain of BCSC properties of Pin1overexpressing HMLE cells could enhance tumorigenicity, we
performed tumor-seeding experiments at limiting dilutions in
nude mice. We overexpressed Pin1 in HMLER cells, HMLE cells
transformed with V12H-Ras, which is needed to enable Snail or
Twist-overexpressing HMLE cells to form tumors in nude mice
(28, 32). Pin1-overexpressing and control HMLER cells were
injected in limiting dilutions subcutaneously in nude mice. 1 

www.aacrjournals.org

104 Pin1-expressing HMLER cells formed tumors in 4 of 6 mice,
whereas no tumors formed when an equal number of cells
expressing a control vector were injected into mice (Fig. 2F
and G). In fact, 105 of control cells were required to initiate
tumors, and even then, only 2 of 8 injected hosts develop
tumors. However, 105 of Pin1-overexpressing cells formed
tumors in 7 of 8 mice. Hence, Pin1 overexpression potently
increases the BCSC frequency more than 30-folds in HMLER
cells (P ¼ 0.0001). Thus, moderate Pin1 overexpression
potently drives the expansion and tumorigenicity of BCSCs
in vitro and in vivo.
Moderate Pin1 overexpression in HMLEs induces
epithelial–mesenchymal transition
Overexpression of Twist or Snail in HMLE cells also induces
an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which may be
linked to BCSC properties (28). Given the effects of Pin1
overexpression on BCSCs, we examined whether Pin1 might
activate EMT. Pin1-overexpressing cells, which had a much
higher percentage of the CD24CD44þ population and mammosphere-forming activity, developed a ﬁbroblast-like
appearance, suggesting a transition to a mesenchymal phenotype (Fig. 3A). Neither W34A nor K63A Pin1 point mutant
induced such morphologic changes, consistent with their
failure to promote BCSC properties (Fig. 3A). To conﬁrm

that Pin1-overexpressing cells have undergone EMT, we
analyzed epithelial and mesenchymal markers using qRTPCR and Western blot analysis. Indeed, Pin1 overexpression
drastically downregulated mRNA levels of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin, but upregulated expression of
mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin, vimentin, and
ﬁbronectin (Fig. 3B). These results were further conﬁrmed by
the ﬁndings that Pin1-overexpressed cells had decreased
protein levels of E-cadherin, increased protein levels of Ncadherin, Zeb1, and vimentin, whereas W34A or K63A
mutants had no effect (Fig. 3C; ref. 28). Moreover, ectopic
Pin1, but not W34A or K63A mutant expression caused an
increase in cell migration, a property associated with EMT, as

3608

measured by wound-healing assay (Fig. 3D and E) and transwell assay (Fig. 3F and G). Thus, moderate overexpression of
Pin1, but not its inactive mutants, potently coinduces BCSC
and EMT properties, as did Twist or Snail (28).
To further conﬁrm the role of Pin1 in EMT, we silenced Pin1
expression using shRNA in MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
The control MCF7 cells displayed an elongated spindle shape,
whereas Pin1 KD cells exhibited more epithelial-like cobblestone morphology (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Pin1 KD also
increased the expression of E-cadherin and decreased the
expression of Zeb1 and vimentin (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Therefore, Pin1 is critical for the EMT process in breast cancer
cells.

Pin1 inhibition by chemical compound, shRNA, or
miRNA suppresses the BCSC-enriched population
Given the dramatic effects of Pin1 overexpression on promoting BCSC expansion, we wondered whether endogenous
Pin1 is required for maintaining the BCSC population. To
address this question, we ﬁrst inhibited Pin1 function by
treating HMLE cells with PiB, a chemical compound that
selectively inhibits the parvulin family of prolyl isomerases
that include Pin1 (33). A 4 to 5 time reduction of the CD24
CD44þ population was detected 72 hours after PiB treatment
(Fig. 4A and C). We then evaluated the ALDHþ population,
which is enriched in normal stem cells, luminal progenitor
cells, and/or BCSCs, using the ALDEFLUOR assay (27). PiB
treatment also signiﬁcantly reduced ALDHþ population by 4
times in HMLE (Supplementary Fig. S1A). We also treated
MCF10A cells and found PiB treatment led to about 4 times

www.aacrjournals.org

decrease of CD24CD44þ population and more than one half
loss of ALDHþ population (data not shown). The ability of PiB
to inhibit the BCSC population is consistent with the above
ﬁndings that the catalytically inactive Pin1 mutant fails to
regulate BCSCs (Fig. 2B–E).
Given that PiB is not a very potent or speciﬁc Pin1
inhibitor, it can also inhibit Par14, another member of the
parvulin family (33), we used Pin1 KD to conﬁrm the role of
endogenous Pin1 in sustaining the population of BCSCs.
Pin1 was effectively and stably silenced using lentiviruses
expressing a validated Pin1 shRNA in HMLE, BT474, and
MCF7 cells (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S1B), as shown
(34). Importantly, silencing Pin1 reduced the size of CD24
CD44þ population about 30 to 50 times in HMLE (Fig. 4B and
C) and about 2 to 6 times in BT474 and MCF7 cells (Fig. 4F
and G). Similar results were observed in ALDHþ population

as well (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Consistently, Pin1 KD cells
formed fewer and smaller mammospheres than the control
cells in HMLE (Fig. 4D and E) and BT474 and MCF7 cells
(Fig. 4H). Thus, either chemical or genetic inhibition of Pin1
potently decreases the BCSC-enriched population.
To investigate the effects of Pin1 inhibition by miR200c in
breast cancer cells, we examined the CD24CD44þ population
and mammosphere formation in BT474 and MCF7 cells
infected with tetracycline-inducible miR200c lentiviruses. As
shown in HMLE cells (Fig. 1F and G), induction of miR200c
expression by adding tetracycline decreased Pin1 expression
(Supplementary Fig. S1B) and reduced CD24CD44þ population and mammosphere formation in these breast cancer cell
lines (Fig. 4F–H). To further conﬁrm that Pin1 mediates the
BCSC effects of miR200c in breast cancer cells, we moderately
expressed the miR200c-resistant Pin1 coding sequence using a
retroviral construct in BT474 and MCF7 cells that already
stably expressed tetracycline-inducible miR200c (Supplementary Fig. S1B), as did in HMLEs (Fig. 1F). Indeed, moderate
expression of miR200c-resistant Pin1 fully rescued the BCSC
phenotypes inhibited by miR200c expression in both BT474
and MCF7 cells (Fig. 4F–H). Thus, Pin1 is a critical mediator of
miR200c to regulate BCSCs in breast cancer.
Pin1 knockout decreases the abundance and
repopulating capability of normal MaSCs
BCSCs share some characteristics and regulatory pathways
with normal mammary stem cells (MaSCs; 1, 4, 27). Expression
of genes that modulate stem cells is also associated with poor
prognosis in cancer, suggesting that CSCs may require stem
cell functions for tumor initiation, growth, and/or metastasis
(35, 36). Therefore, we evaluated whether Pin1 regulates normal MaSCs.
To address this question, we ﬁrst performed ﬂow cytometry
analysis of MECs isolated from 10-week-old Pin1 KO and
wild-type littermates at the proestrus stage of the estrous
cycle for cell surface markers, LinCD24þCD29þ and Lin
CD24medCD49fhi, which have been widely used to enrich for
stem cell populations in mammary tissues (24, 25). MaSCenriched LinCD24þCD29þ and LinCD24medCD49fhi populations were dramatically reduced in mammary glands in Pin1
KO mice, as compared with those in Pin1 WT littermates (Fig.
5A–C). Moreover, mammosphere formation assays also
showed that Pin1 KO Lin MECs formed fewer and smaller
mammospheres than wild-type controls (Fig. 5D and E).
Although mammosphere assays are a powerful surrogate
method to evaluate stem cells, not all mouse-derived mammosphere-forming cells contain regenerative stem cell activity.
Therefore, we performed functional limiting dilution transplantation experiments to determine the effects of Pin1 deletion on the repopulating capability of MaSCs, as described (24,
25). Freshly dissociated Lin Pin1 WT or KO MECs were
transplanted into cleared fat pads of syngeneic mice at
decreasing cell numbers. Pin1 KO had dramatically decreased
repopulating capability (Fig. 5F and G). Based on a single-hit
Poisson distribution, the mammary repopulating unit (MRU)
was determined to be 1 MRU per 16,733 cells in Pin1 WT MECs,
whereas the frequency decreased about 6-fold in Pin1 KO cells

3610

Cancer Res; 74(13) July 1, 2014

(Fig. 5G). Importantly, mammary fat pad reconstitution was
severely impaired in outgrowths of Pin1 KO MECs (Fig. 5F and
G). These in vitro and in vivo results together indicate that Pin1
deletion in MECs leads to reduced MaSC frequency and
repopulating activity. These results are consistent with our
previous ﬁndings that MECs in Pin1 KO MECs fail to undergo
massive proliferation during pregnancy in mice (19), a major
function of MaSCs (24, 25).
Pin1 promotes the expansion of BCSC-enriched
populations, as well as basal/myoepithelial and luminal
progenitors in primary normal human MECs
To extend our ﬁndings in cell lines and animal models, we
test the inﬂuence of Pin1 expression on the stem cell–enriched
population in normal primary human MECs. We ﬁrst sorted
LinMECs isolated from reduction mammoplasty tissues, and
then infected them with lentiviruses expressing Flag-Pin1 or
control vector (Fig. 6A and B). Pin1-overexpressing cells
showed increased mammosphere formation in all of the three
cases tested (Fig. 6C). Moreover, Pin1 overexpression led to 6to 10-fold increase in the CD24CD44þ population (Fig. 6D and
Supplementary Fig. S3A). Thus, Pin1 confers stem cell–related
properties on normal human MECs.
Increasing evidence shows that human mammary epithelium is organized in a hierarchical manner. Taking advantage of the fact that primary MECs may contain the cell types
of both luminal and basal/myoepithelial lineages, we
attempt to determine the effects of Pin1 overexpression on
these 2 lineages. We found that Pin1-overexpressing cells
have higher percentage of the EpCAM MUC1 CD10þ
CD49fþ population (Fig. 6E and Supplementary Fig. S3B),
which enriched basal/myoepithelial progenitors (37). As
ALDH activity is also a marker of luminal progenitors
(37), we measured the ALDHþ population in these primary
MECs and found that Pin1 overexpression increased the
abundance of ALDHþ cells (Fig. 6F and Supplementary Fig.
S3C). These data suggest that Pin1 not only promotes the
expansion of stem cell populations, but also the basal/
myoepithelial and luminal progenitors.
Pin1 is required to sustain tumorigenic potential of
human primary BCSCs
In above experiments, we have demonstrated that endogenous Pin1 is required for the BCSC maintenance in cell lines (Fig.
4). To further assess whether Pin1 is critical for the tumorigenesis of BCSCs in primary breast cancers, we sorted Lin
CD24CD44þ cells from freshly isolated human breast cancer
cells of 8 patients (Fig. 7A and B and Supplementary Table), and
then evaluated the impact of Pin1 on BCSCs in vitro and in vivo.
We ﬁrst examined the expression of Pin1 in Lin
CD24CD44þ, Linnon-CD24CD44þ cancer cells, and normal MECs from patients. Compared with those in normal
MECs, Pin1 mRNA levels were 5 times higher in Lin-nonCD24-CD44þ cancer cells and more than 30 times higher in
BCSC-enriched LinCD24CD44þ cells in case 2 (Fig. 7C). Pin1
protein was also markedly upregulated in the Lin
CD24CD44þ cells infected with shCtrl, compared with
non-CD24CD44þ cells in this case (Fig. 7D). This upregulation

in BCSC-enriched population was consistent with the role of
Pin1 in promoting the BCSC expansion.
Given that Pin1 is highly expressed in the BCSC-enriched
population, next we tested whether endogenous Pin1 was
required to maintain the BCSC population in the primary
breast cancer by transducing LinCD24CD44þ primary
breast cancer cells with lentivirus expressing Pin1 or control
shRNA. Pin1 was efﬁciently silenced after 3 days of puromycin
selection (Fig. 7D). As we cultured the sorted CD24CD44þ
cells in ultra-low attachment dishes, the cells infected with
control shRNA still had a high percentage of CD24CD44þ cells
after selection (Fig. 7E), as shown (5). However, this population
was signiﬁcantly reduced in Pin1 KD cells, being only one ﬁfth
of the control cells in case 2 (Fig. 7E). Pin1 KD also signiﬁcantly
decreased the mammosphere-forming activity of the CD24
CD44þ cells in this case (Fig. 7F). Thus, Pin1 plays an important

www.aacrjournals.org

role in sustaining the BCSC properties in human primary
breast cancer cells.
We ﬁnally investigated whether Pin1 was required for the
tumorigenicity of the BCSC-enriched LinCD24CD44þ population. We injected 2,000 control and Pin1 shRNA-transduced
LinCD24CD44þ cells, or Linnon-CD24CD44þ cells isolated from 8 patients with breast cancer into 8 nude mice, using
the same procedure as that described previously (5).
Although no tumors developed in mice injected with the
cells that were not CD24CD44þ, 2,000 control cells from
same patients generated 6 tumors in 8 injected mice (P0
tumors; Fig. 7G). However, lentivirus-mediated KD of Pin1
not only drastically reduced tumor incidence (Fig. 7G), but
also potently reduced tumor growth, as measured by tumor
volumes and weights (Fig. 7H and I). We further dissociated
the tumors and sorted again for CD24CD44þ cells for the

serial transplantation. We randomly selected 4 P0 shCtrl
tumors, and passaged each one into two nude mice for the
next generation of xenografts (P1). For the one P0 shPin1
tumor, we passaged it into 8 mice for P1 xenografts. When
2,000 control cells were passaged in nude mice, they could be
serially transplanted at least for two more passages (P1 and
P2) without reduced tumorigenicity (Fig. 7G), as described
(5). However, 2,000 Pin1 KD cells had substantially decreased
frequency of tumor formation and reduced tumor growth
through passages (Fig. 7H and I). Thus, expression of Pin1 is
highly enriched in primary human BCSCs and silencing Pin1
strongly interferes with the expansion and tumorigenesis of
human primary BCSCs in vitro and in vivo.

Discussion
We uncover that as an important target suppressed by
miR200c, Pin1 drives the expansion, invasiveness and tumor-

igenicity of human BCSCs, as well as enhances the abundance and repopulating capacity of normal mouse MaSCs.
Expression of Pin1 is highly enriched in human primary
BCSCs, and overexpression of Pin1 endows BCSC traits
normal human primary breast epithelial cells, whereas KD
of either gene potently inhibits human primary BCSCs and
tumorigenesis. Thus, miR200c/Pin1 signals a pivotal pathway that regulates BCSCs and offers promising new drug
targets in BCSCs.
miR200c has been shown to regulate CSC function and EMT
through repressing Bmi1, Zeb1/Zeb2 (4, 7, 8). Here we showed
that miR200c directly bound to a highly conserved region in
the 30 UTR of Pin1. Mutations in this region abolished the
repressing effect of miR200c on Pin1 transcription. Moreover,
in the presence of miR200c overexpression, recovering
Pin1 expression by a miR200c-resistant construct could fully
rescue the BCSC phenotypes repressed by miR200c, such as

mammosphere formation and CD24CD44þ population size.
Consistently, Pin1 KD could completely mimic the BCSC
phenotypes, which were induced by miR200c overexpression.
In primary human breast cancer samples, we have shown that
Pin1 expression markedly increased in the BCSC-enriched
population, which is consistent with the ﬁnding that miR200c
is speciﬁcally downregulated in BCSCs in comparison to nontumorigenic cancer cells (4). These data demonstrate that Pin1
is a functionally important target of miR200c in BCSC
maintenance.
Pin1 is overexpressed and plays a critical role in the development of breast cancer, but its role in BCSCs is unknown. We
found that Pin1 overexpression dramatically increased the
BCSC-enriched CD24CD44þ population and mammosphere
formation, as well as induced EMT and enhanced tumorigenic
potential in human breast cell lines, whereas inhibiting Pin1 by
chemical inhibitor or gene silencing potently decreased the
BCSC-enriched population and mammosphere formation. The
signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings is further substantiated by the
demonstrations that Pin1 expression was highest in BCSCs
among human primary breast tumor cells or normal breast
epithelial cells, that Pin1 overexpression in primary human
normal MECs increased the CD24CD44þ population and
mammosphere formation, and that Pin1 KD in primary human
breast cancer cells reduced the population, mammosphere
formation, and tumorigenesis of BCSCs. Thus, Pin1 drives the
expansion and tumorigenesis of BCSCs not only in human
breast cell lines, but also in primary human normal and breast
cancer cells.
We have demonstrated that Pin1 KO reduced the abundance and repopulating activity of normal MaSC-enriched
populations in mice, indicating that Pin1 is also required to
sustain MaSCs in normal mammary glands. It is worth
noting that CSCs share many characteristics of normal stem
cells (35, 36). The tightly regulated process of normal stem
cell expansion is dysregulated in CSCs because of transforming events, resulting in an unrestricted expansion of selfrenewing cells in cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that
BCSCs are likely regulated by some important components
present in normal stem cells (4, 27). The miRNA expression
proﬁle of BCSCs and normal mammary stem cells is remarkably similar (4). miR200c is poorly expressed in both normal
and tumorigenic stem cells and inhibits the function of both
normal MaSCs and BCSCs (4), consistent with our ﬁndings
that Pin1 promote the expansion of normal MaSCs and
BCSCs but is inhibited by miR200c. Moreover, expression
of normal human MaSC signature correlates with high-grade
breast cancers, which also have higher frequencies of BCSCs
(1). Our data suggest that Pin1 is a pivotal regulator shared
by both MaSCs and BCSCs.
The concept of CSCs has important therapeutic implications
because current therapies have been developed to decrease
tumor size and, albeit they may produce dramatic responses,
are not likely to result in stable, long-lasting remission if the
rare CSCs are not targeted too. In this regard, Pin1 may offer a
promising target for cancer therapy, because Pin1 not only
promote the growth of regular breast cancer cells, but also the
expansion and tumorigenicity of BCSCs. The following prop-

3614

Cancer Res; 74(13) July 1, 2014

erties make Pin1 a particularly attractive candidate as a new
anticancer target (10). First, it is an enzyme with high substrate
speciﬁcity and a well-deﬁned active site structure (38). Second,
Pin1 is often overexpressed and/or activated in human cancers
and its expression strongly correlates with poor patient outcome (12, 39). Reducing Pin1 expression by SNP is associated
with reduced cancer risk for a wide range of cancers, including
for breast cancer (13, 14, 40, 41). Although Pin1 overexpression
causes cell transformation and tumorigenesis (16, 17), Pin1 KD
inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in vivo (42). Moreover, Pin1
KO mice, which develop normally, are fully resistant to tumorigenesis induced by MMTV-Neu/ErbB2 or -Ras (20). Third,
Pin1 activates numerous oncogenes and also inactivates a large
number of tumor suppressors (10). As a results, inhibiting Pin1
may have the unique and desired feature to block many other
oncogenic pathways as well as to restore the function of tumor
suppressors. Finally, and most importantly, Pin1 drives the
expansion, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity of BCSCs. The
inhibitory effects of Pin1 inhibition on BCSCs were not only
demonstrated in cell lines, but also veriﬁed in freshly isolated
primary human breast cancer cells, suggesting that Pin1
inhibitors may have the potential to restrict or even eradicate
CSCs. Thus, Pin1 inhibitors, which are under active development (33, 38, 43–50), might have the unique properties to
inhibit the growth of regular breast cancer cells, and also to
suppress the expansion and tumorigenicity of BCSCs, which
are resistant to current therapies.
