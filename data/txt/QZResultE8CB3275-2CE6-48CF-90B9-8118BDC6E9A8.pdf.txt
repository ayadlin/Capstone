Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cellular senescence has been recently shown to play an important role in opposing tumour
initiation and promotion. Senescence induced by oncogenes or loss of tumour suppressor genes is
thought to critically dependent on the induction of the p19Arf-p53 pathway. The Skp2 E3ubiquitin ligase can act as a proto-oncogene and its aberrant overexpression is frequently observed
in human cancers. Here we show that although Skp2 inactivation on its own does not induce
cellular senescence, aberrant proto-oncogenic signals as well as inactivation of tumour suppressor
genes do trigger a potent, tumor-suppressive senescence response in mice and cells devoid of
Skp2. Notably, Skp2 inactivation and oncogenic stress driven senescence neither elicits activation
of the p19Arf-p53 pathway nor DNA damage, but instead depends on ATF4, p27, and p21. We
further demonstrate that genetic Skp2 inactivation evokes cellular senescence even in oncogenic
conditions in which the p19Arf/p53 response is impaired, whereas a Skp2-SCF complex inhibitor
can trigger cellular senescence in p53/PTEN deficient cells and tumour regression in preclinical
studies. Our findings therefore provide proof of principle evidence that Skp2 pharmacological
inhibition may represent a general approach for cancer prevention and therapy.

Cellular senescence represents an irreversible form of cell-cycle arrest that can be triggered
by a variety of insults. Induction of cellular senescence (for example, by oncogenic Ras)
results in p19Arf (encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus, also known as Cdkn2a locus) and p53
accumulation, which is critical for this senescence response. Recent studies suggest that
cellular senescence can act as an important tumour-suppressive mechanism to restrict
tumour development in vivo1-7.
Inactivation of PTEN functions is frequently observed in human cancers8-10. Although
PTEN negatively regulates cell proliferation and survival, we surprisingly discovered that
acute Pten inactivation triggers the accumulation of p19Arf–p53 and cellular senescence2.
Concomitant inactivation of p53 (also known as Trp53 in mice, and TP53 in humans) and
Pten abrogates this senescence response, in turn promoting invasive and lethal prostate
cancer2. Although these findings further underscore the critical importance of the cellular
senescence Arf–p53 failsafe pathway, the frequent loss or mutation of ARF or P53 in human
cancers would compromise the tumour-suppressive efficacy of this response, thereby
limiting therapeutic potential.

Skp2 is a critical component of the Skp2–SCF complex, which acts as an E3 ligase to target
p27 and other substrates for ubiquitylation and degradation11,12. Recent studies suggest that
Skp2 may have oncogenic activity13-16. Notably, SKP2 overexpression is frequently
observed in human cancer11,12,17, strongly suggesting that SKP2 overexpression may
contribute to tumorigenesis. Skp2-knockout mice are viable and fertile18. Hence, specific
inactivation of Skp2 may represent an appealing therapeutic modality. Here we show that
Skp2 inactivation profoundly restricts tumorigenesis by eliciting cellular senescence only in
oncogenic conditions. Remarkably, this senescence response is triggered in a p19Arf–p53independent manner. Skp2 pharmacological inactivation may therefore represent a general
approach towards a ‘pro-senescence’ therapy for cancer prevention and treatment.

Skp2 loss restores cellular senescence by Ras and E1A
Skp2 deficiency delays cell cycle progression11,12. We therefore asked whether Skp2
deficiency would trigger cellular senescence. We isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) from wild-type and Skp2−/− mice and determined cellular senescence in these cells
by senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining. Although Skp2−/− MEFs
proliferated less than wild-type MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 1d)11,12, cellular senescence in
Skp2−/− MEFs was comparable to that in the wild-type MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In
contrast, acute inactivation of Pten in MEFs markedly increased cellular senescence as
previously reported (Supplementary Fig. 1a)2. Thus, Skp2 deficiency by itself does not elicit
cellular senescence.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Ectopic overexpression of proto-oncogenic Ras (H-RasV12) in MEFs elicits cellular
senescence through the p19Arf–p53 pathway19,20. Simultaneous co-expression of E1A and
Ras in MEFs overcomes Ras-induced senescence by preventing activation of the p19Arf–p53
pathway and resulting in oncogenic transformation20. Thus, E1A enables Ras to overcome
the cellular senescence response. As Skp2 also cooperates with oncogenic Ras to induce cell
transformation13, it is conceivable that Skp2 might also display its oncogenic activity by
antagonizing Ras-induced cellular senescence. On this basis, we tested whether endogenous
Skp2 activity is required for cellular transformation induced by Ras and E1A. Although
cellular senescence was not observed in wild-type MEFs after Ras and E1A overexpression,
Skp2 deficiency triggered cellular senescence (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). We also found
that the ability of Ras to induce cellular senescence was far greater in Skp2−/− MEFs than in
wild-type MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). It should be noted that the induction of p19Arf
and p53 protein levels in Skp2−/− MEFs by Ras was comparable if not lower than that of

wild-type MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Moreover, Skp2 inactivation profoundly restricted
cell proliferation and transformation after Ras and E1A overexpression (Supplementary Fig.
1e, f) Thus, Skp2 inactivation triggers cellular senescence in the presence of powerful
oncogenic signals, even when the p19Arf–p53 response is evaded.

Skp2 loss causes senescence in Pten+/− and Arf−/− mutants

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We assessed whether Skp2 inactivation would trigger cellular senescence even when cells
experience loss of major tumour-suppressive networks such as those controlled by Pten and
p19Arf–p53. To this end, we crossed Skp2−/− mutants with Pten+/− and Arf−/− mutants. The
resulting compound mice were further intercrossed to generate MEFs of different genotypes
for cell proliferation and senescence assays. As aforementioned, Skp2−/− MEFs grew much
slower than wild-type MEFs, whereas wild-type and Pten+/− MEFs grew comparably
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). No obvious cellular senescence was observed in wild-type, Pten+/−
and Skp2−/− MEFs (Fig. 1a) Surprisingly, Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs had a slower growth rate
than Skp2−/− MEFs and exhibited full-blown characteristics of cellular senescence such as
flattened large cells and positive SA-β-gal staining (Fig. 1a and Supplementary 2a). We also
detected cellular senescence in Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs under hypoxic conditions
(Supplementary Fig. 2b). We did not see cooperation between Pten inactivation and Skp2
deficiency in triggering apoptosis, although Skp2−/− MEFs had a higher rate of apoptosis
than wild-type MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 3a)18. However, the apoptosis rate in the prostate
of Pten+/− Skp2−/− mice was higher than in wild-type, Pten+/− and Skp2−/− mice (see later
and Supplementary Fig. 3b).
As cellular senescence is largely dependent on activation of the p19Arf–p53 pathway in
MEFs2,21,22, we determined whether this pathway is activated in Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs.
Notably, we found that p19Arf and p53 protein levels in Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs were
comparable to levels in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting that
the p19Arf–p53 pathway may not be involved in the senescence response in Pten+/− Skp2−/−
MEFs. To test this hypothesis further, we exposed MEFs of various genotypes to two wellestablished p53-inactivating tools: a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against p53 (ref. 23) or a
dominant-negative p53 mutant (p53-DN)24. Notably, in both conditions cell growth was
promoted in wild-type and Pten−/− MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b), but neither of them
overcame the cellular senescence nor the growth arrest in Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs (Fig. 1c
and Supplementary Fig. 5c), suggesting that Skp2-deficiency cooperates with Pten
inactivation to trigger a new senescence response by a p19Arf–p53-independent pathway.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

p19Arf induction is required for cellular senescence in MEFs in the context of acute Pten
inactivation25, whereas loss of p19Arf leads to cell immortalization2,21,22. We investigated
whether Skp2 inactivation could elicit cellular senescence in an Arf-deficient genetic
background. Notably, Arf−/− Skp2−/− MEFs showed massive cellular senescence similar to
Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs (Fig. 1d). Moreover, p53 expression was not induced in Arf−/−
Skp2−/− MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 6a). This cellular senescence profoundly suppressed the
growth of Arf−/− MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 6b). Skp2 deficiency also induced cellular
senescence after p53 inactivation (Supplementary Fig. 6c, d).
DNA damage has been recently associated with cellular senescence26-28. However, we
found no evidence of DNA-damage-response activation in Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs, as
determined by the levels of phosphorylated-(S15)-p53 and -γ-H2ax (also known as γ-H2afx)
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Collectively, these results support the notion that Skp2 inactivation
can trigger a new type of cellular senescence that does not involve DNA damage and can
suppress transformation even when the p19Arf–p53 response is impaired.

p27, p21 and ATF4 induction contribute to senescence
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next examined the molecular mechanism by which Skp2 deficiency synergizes with
oncogenic insults to trigger cellular senescence. Although p53 and p19Arf levels remained
unchanged, we found that Skp2 deficiency cooperated with Pten inactivation or Arf loss to
induce p27 expression (Fig. 2a, b). p21 expression was also increased in Pten+/− Skp2−/−
and Arf−/− Skp2−/− MEFs (Fig. 2a, b). E2F1, cyclin D1 and Cdt1, involved in cell cycle
progression and DNA replication, are also targets for Skp2 (refs 12, 29). We found that
cyclin D1, but not E2F1 and Cdt1, were induced in Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs (Supplementary
Fig. 7a). Because cyclin D1 promotes cell cycle progression, its upregulation is unlikely to
be involved in mediating senescence in Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress proteins such as BiP (also known as Hspa5 or GRP78),
phospho-Perk (p-Perk), and ATF4 are induced after oncogenic insults and have an important
role in cellular senescence30. We did not find a significant increase in BiP or p-Perk
(Supplementary Fig. 7b and data not shown) in Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs. In contrast, ATF4
was markedly induced in Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs (Fig. 2a). Likewise, we also observed a
marked increase in ATF4 protein levels, but not p-Perk, in Arf−/− Skp2−/− MEFs (Fig. 2b
and Supplementary Fig. 7c). The induction of ATF4 protein levels in Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs
was not accompanied by messenger RNA upregulation, nor by the enhanced ATF4 protein
stability (Supplementary Fig. 8 and data not shown). Instead, we observed an increase in
phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α; also known as p-Eif2s1) in Pten+/− Skp2−/− and Arf−/−
Skp2−/− MEFs compared to wild-type cells (Fig. 2a, b). Because p-eIF2α positively
regulates ATF4 translation31, our results indicate that ATF4 upregulation is probably
triggered by the enhancement of p-eIF2α levels.
As p27, p21 and ATF4 were induced in both Pten+/− Skp2−/− and Arf−/− Skp2−/− MEFs, we
next determined whether their upregulation contributes to senescence. p27 (also known as
cdkn1b) shRNA efficiently abrogated p27 expression and partially rescued growth arrest and
cellular senescence in Pten+/− Skp2−/− MEFs (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs 9a, b and
10a). Similarly, knockdown of Atf4 or p21 (also known as Cdkn1a) in these cells also
partially reversed cellular senescence and cell arrest (Fig. 2e–h and Supplementary Figs 9c
and 10b, c). Concomitant knockdown of Atf4, p21 and p27 in these cells reversed cellular
senescence more efficiently than their individual knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 10d). In
contrast, in Skp2−/− MEFs, p27 knockdown accelerated growth whereas Atf4 knockdown
did not (Supplementary Fig. 10e, f). These results strongly indicate that the concomitant
upregulation of p27, p21and ATF4 is a required and powerful engine for the induction of
cellular senescence upon Skp2 inactivation.

Skp2 loss restricts tumorigenesis independently of Arf-p53
We found that inactivation of Skp2 in the presence of an oncogenic stress results in the
induction of cellular senescence that opposes transformation in vitro even when the p19Arf–
p53 response is impaired. We next determined whether Skp2 loss restricts tumorigenesis in
vivo through similar mechanisms and first analysed tumorigenesis in Skp2−/− Pten+/−
compound mutants (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Although Pten heterozygous inactivation
reduced lifespan in mice, compound Skp2 deficiency prolonged overall survival (Fig. 3a).
Pten+/− mice develop lymphadenopathy and adrenal tumours (pheochromacytoma) at
complete penetrance32,33. As expected, Pten+/− mice developed adrenal tumours with 100%
penetrance by 1 year of age, whereas Skp2 loss remarkably abrogated adrenal tumour
formation in compound mutants (P < 0.0001; Fig. 3b, top, c and Supplementary Fig. 11b).
Pten protein expression in adrenal tissues was comparable between wild-type, Pten+/− and
Pten+/− Skp2−/− mice, before or after tumour occurrence, suggesting that there is no loss of

heterozygosity at the Pten locus in the adrenal tissues in any of these mutants and conditions
(Supplementary Fig. 11c). Lymphadenopathy after Pten inactivation was also profoundly
inhibited by Skp2 loss (P < 0.01; Fig. 3b, top, and Supplementary Fig. 11d). Tumorigenesis
was also markedly suppressed in other organs (for example, in the prostate, where the
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) incidence was profoundly restricted by Skp2
inactivation; data not shown).
To determine whether Skp2 inactivation along with Pten inactivation would trigger cellular
senescence in vivo, we performed SA-β-gal staining in the few hyperplastic lymphoid
lesions still identified in Pten+/− Skp2−/− mice (see, for example, Supplementary Fig. 10d).
We observed both cellular senescence and p27 induction in the lymphoid tissues from
Pten+/− Skp2−/−− mice (Fig. 3d, e and Supplementary Fig. 12), which inversely correlated
with cell proliferation (Fig. 3f).
We then examined whether Skp2 inactivation would also restrict tumorigenesis after Arf loss
by crossing Skp2−/− with Arf−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 13). Skp2 inactivation markedly
prolonged the overall survival of Arf−/− mice (Fig. 4a). Around 33% of Arf−/− mice
developed sarcoma and/or lymphoma within 1 year (Fig. 4b–d)34,35. In contrast, none of the
Arf−/− Skp2−/− compound mutant mice showed signs of tumour formation (P < 0.02; Fig.
4b–d).

Senescence after Pten and Skp2 inactivation in the prostate
Complete Pten inactivation in the prostate triggers a tumour-suppressive cellular senescence
response2. We therefore examined whether this response could be further potentiated by
Skp2 loss and affect tumorigenesis after complete Pten inactivation in the prostate. For
prostate-specific inactivation, we made use of Cre-loxP mediated recombination and
probasin (Pbsn, also known as PB)-Cre4 transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase
after puberty in the prostatic epithelium2. We obtained PtenloxP/loxP;PB-Cre4 and
PtenloxP/loxPSkp2−/−;PB-Cre4 compound mutant mice, hereafter referred to as Ptenpc−/− and
Ptenpc−/− Skp2−/− mice, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 14a). Although complete Pten
inactivation in mouse prostates leads to invasive prostate cancers, it does not affect overall
survival2. We did not detect a difference in overall survival between Ptenpc−/− and Ptenpc−/−
Skp2−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 14b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Prostate cancer development in these mice was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and histopathological analysis. Consistent with our previous findings2, MRI analysis
showed prostate tumour masses in Ptenpc−/− mice at 6 months of age, which were
significantly reduced in Ptenpc−/− Skp2−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 14c). The average size
of the prostate in Ptenpc−/− mice was tenfold larger than in wild-type mice, whereas
complete Skp2 loss markedly reduced tumour weight after complete Pten inactivation (Fig.
5a). Histological analysis showed that Skp2 loss inhibited invasive prostate cancer after Pten
inactivation, albeit PIN lesions were still observed in Ptenpc−/− Skp2−/− mice
(Supplementary Fig. 14d, e). Furthermore, this suppressive effect by Skp2 loss was
persistent, as we also observed a profound reduction in tumour weight and invasive prostate
cancer in Ptenpc−/− Skp2−/− mice at 15 months of age (Supplementary Fig. 14f, g).
We next investigated, in vivo, the molecular basis for tumour suppression elicited by Skp2
inactivation. We found that p27 protein expression was synergistically induced in prostates
from compound mutants, as determined by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis
(Supplementary Fig. 15a, b), whereas p53 expression was comparably induced in Ptenpc−/−
and Ptenpc−/− Skp2−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 15c). Skp2 deficiency profoundly enhanced
cellular senescence upon Pten inactivation (Fig. 5b). This was observed at earlier time points
and inversely correlated with cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 16a, b). Notably, this

response was also sustained over time. We could detect massive β-gal positivity in prostates
from Ptenpc−/− Skp2−/− mice even at 15 months of age, whereas β-gal positivity was barely
detected at that age in prostates from Ptenpc−/− mice (Fig. 5c). Thus, Skp2 inactivation
potentiates and sustains over time the senescence response elicited by an oncogenic
stimulus, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of Skp2 may be used as a powerful prosenescence approach for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.

Skp2–SCF complex inactivation triggers senescence

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To corroborate the potential use of such an approach for cancer therapy, we determined
whether pharmacological inactivation of the Skp2–SCF complex induces cellular senescence
in p53-deficient cells and, importantly, suppresses the growth of the pre-formed tumours. To
this end, we took advantage of MLN4924 (ref. 36)—an inhibitor for the neddylation of
cullin 1, which is a component of Skp2–SCF complex. We used PC3 prostate cancer cells
for this preclinical analysis because these cells are both p53-null and PTEN-null, hence
representing one of the most aggressive genetic states encountered in human cancer.
Remarkably, treatment of MLN4924 in PC3 cells triggered cellular senescence (Fig. 5d).
Moreover, the growth of PC3 tumours treated with MLN4924 in vivo was also suppressed
(Fig. 5e). Coherent with these findings, Skp2 silencing in PC3 and in DU145 prostate cancer
cells, which have also evaded the p53 response, triggered cellular senescence and
cooperated with the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin to induce cellular senescence and
growth arrest (Supplementary Fig. 17). These results demonstrate the critical role of Skp2
inactivation in the induction of cellular senescence not only in mouse cells, but also in
human cancer cells experiencing failure of p53 and other major tumour suppressive
networks.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

On the basis of our results, we propose a working model for the role of Skp2 inactivationinduced cellular senescence in tumour prevention and suppression in vivo (Fig. 5f). This
model rests on three new and unexpected findings with important therapeutic implications.
First, Skp2 inactivation does not trigger cellular senescence in vivo or in vitro on its own, but
rather elicits a senescence response after oncogenic stress. This response is critically
dependent on p27, p21 and ATF4 induction. Our results are supported by recent reports
showing that acute inactivation of the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor in vitro
or overexpression of the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax triggers Skp2
downregulation and cellular senescence37,38. Second, we show that cellular senescence
driven by Skp2 inactivation along with oncogenic insults takes place without the activation
of the p19Arf–p53 failsafe pathway. Although senescence is also observed in p53/PTEN-null
cells such as PC3, it will be important to determine the specific genetic states that favour
evasion of this failsafe mechanism, also in a cell-type-specific manner. For instance, loss or
constitutively low expression of p27, p21 and ATF4 could impair this response. This
knowledge will in turn identify new pharmacological nodes of tumour-type-specific
intervention. Third, we show that Skp2 deficiency in conjunction with oncogenic signals
elicits a senescence response that profoundly restricts tumorigenesis in vivo in numerous
mouse models in which tumour suppressor networks are faulty or inactive. Our findings are
consistent with a recent report demonstrating that mice transplanted with BCR–ABLtransduced Skp2−/− bone marrow cells show a delayed onset of a myeloproliferative
syndrome39.
As Skp2 can in principle be subjected to specific pharmacological inhibition because of its
enzymatic activity, our results call for the development and optimization of Skp2 small
molecule inhibitors. Skp2 pharmacological inhibition could be particularly appealing and

effective in view of the fact that complete Skp2 inactivation in the mouse is compatible with
life, whereas cellular senescence is only triggered by Skp2 inactivation in conjunction with
oncogenic conditions.

METHODS SUMMARY
PtenloxP/loxP, Arf−/− and Skp2−/− mice were generated as described previously2,18,35.

was determined by assessing SA-β-gal activity, and the in vivo cell proliferation assay was
performed by Ki67 staining on the paraffin tissue sections. The cell transformation assay
was determined by the soft agar assay. p53 shRNA is from S. W. Lowe and the pBabe-p53

Cell proliferation, transformation and senescence

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Primary MEFs were isolated from individual embryos of various genotype at passage 2,
infected with retroviruses or lentiviruses expressing GFP shRNA, p27 shRNA or Atf4
shRNA for 2 days, selected with 2 μg ml−1 puromycin for 4 days, and plated for the cell
proliferation and senescence assay. For cell proliferation assay, 2 × 104 MEFs were seeded
in 12 wells in triplicate, collected, and stained with trypan blue at different days. Numbers of
viable cells were directly counted under the microscope. To determine cellular senescence,
MEFs were plated at 104 cells per well of a 6-well plate in triplicate, and after 4 days SA-βgal activity was measured using the senescence detection kit (Calbiochem) and quantified
(around 100–200 cells per well). For in vivo cellular senescence, frozen sections 6-μm thick
were stained for β-gal as described earlier. For in vivo cell proliferation, the paraffin section
was used for Ki67 staining, and the percentages of Ki67-positive cells (around 500 cells)
from each sample were counted. For transformation assay, wild-type and Skp2−/− MEFs (3
× 104) infected with RasG12V and E1A were suspended in a medium containing 0.3% agar
onto solidified 0.6% agar per well of a 6-well plate, and the number of colonies was counted
after 21 days.

Nude mice bearing PC3 xenograft tumours (around 300 mm3) were treated with vehicle or
90 mg kg−1 MLN492. Tumour weight was measured at the time of collection after 15 days
of treatment with a scheduling regimen of 3 days of treatment followed by 3 days off
treatment for a total of three courses.
