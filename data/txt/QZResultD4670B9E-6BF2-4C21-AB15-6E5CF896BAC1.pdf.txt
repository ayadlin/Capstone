BACKGROUND: The current study compared the incidence of vascular thromboembolic events (VTEs) in patients with metastatic or
unresectable urothelial carcinoma (UC) who were treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin (GCb); gemcitabine, carboplatin, and
bevacizumab (GCbBev); or gemcitabine and cisplatin (GCis). METHODS: Patients with UC who were treated with GCbBev on protocol
were analyzed prospectively and 2 contemporary control cohorts receiving GCb or GCis were evaluated retrospectively. VTE was
defined as either venous or arterial (myocardial infarctions or cerebral vascular accidents) thrombosis. VTEs were considered to be
related to treatment if they occurred during treatment or within 4 weeks of the completion of treatment. Associations with chemotherapy regimen were tested using either the Fisher exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test. Clinical factors associated with VTEs were analyzed using conditional logistic regression stratified by treatment regimen. RESULTS: Among 198 patients, VTEs occurred in 13 of 51
patients treated with GCbBev (26%), 22 of 92 patients treated with GCb (24%), and 8 of 55 patients treated with GCis (15%). Patient
characteristics were significantly different between the treatment cohorts in terms of age, prior cystectomy, tumor location near pelvic vessels, Khorana risk group, and receipt of antiplatelet therapy. The incidence of VTE and type of VTE (arterial vs venous) did not
differ by type of chemotherapy. Prior cystectomy was associated with an increased risk of VTE (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-4.9 [P 5.047]). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VTE in Cis-treated patients was similar to prior reports. However, the VTE
rate in Cb-treated patients was > 20%, a figure not previously defined in patients with UC and higher than expected. This high incidence of both Cis-related and Cb-related VTEs warrants greater awareness by treating physicians and deserves further study. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Cancer and cancer therapy, including chemotherapy and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted
therapies, have been associated with an increased incidence of vascular thromboembolic events (VTEs): deep venous
thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolus (PE), arterial thrombosis and embolus, cerebrovascular accident, and unstable
angina (UA)/myocardial infarction (MI). A population-based case-control study showed that VTE risk was increased
7-fold in patients with cancer.1 Patients with metastatic disease and those undergoing chemotherapy are at highest risk
of VTEs1-5 and these events can be a leading cause of death in patients with cancer.4,6,7 The hypercoagulable and
thrombotic state in patients with cancer may be due to multiple mechanisms, including activation of the coagulation
cascade through the release of tissue factors and other procoagulants, changes in cellular blood components, increased
platelet aggregation, and endothelial cell damage by tumor cells.8 Chemotherapeutics may magnify this effect and
promote VTEs by worsening endothelial damage, enhancing platelet aggregation, and increasing oxidative damage
leading to vascular toxicity.9
The cancers believed to have highest risk of chemotherapy-related VTEs are gastric and pancreas adenocarcinomas,
with thoracic, lymphoma, gynecologic, bladder, and testicular cancers considered to have a moderate risk.10 Among
platinum-based chemotherapy agents, cisplatin (Cis) is reported to have a high incidence of treatment-related VTE.9,11-14
In a retrospective study of 932 patients with various tumor types who were treated with Cis-based chemotherapy, 18%

developed VTEs during treatment.15 A separate metaanalysis revealed a significantly increased risk of VTEs
associated with Cis-based regimens (relative risk, 1.67;
95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.25-2.23
[P 5 .01]).16
Cis-based chemotherapy combinations are standard,
first-line treatment in patients with metastatic or unresectable urothelial carcinoma (UC); one study reported a
13% rate of VTEs during treatment.17
Although Cis is the treatment of choice in the neoadjuvant,18,19 adjuvant,20 and American Joint Committee on
Cancer stage IV metastatic or unresectable UC disease settings,21 patients are often ineligible for the drug due to
comorbid factors such as older age, renal insufficiency, cardiac complications, and hearing loss.22 Carboplatin (Cb),
another platinum-based agent, is frequently substituted for
Cis based on a more favorable side effect profile. The clinical risk of VTEs in the elderly patient population with cancer who are treated with chemotherapy has been well
described,9 and in one study the use of platinum analogues
was found to have the second highest incidence of VTEs of
all chemotherapy drugs evaluated.13 To our knowledge to
date, the clinical impression is that the incidence of VTEs
associated with Cb therapy for patients with UC is quite
low, supported by the fact no VTEs were reported among
238 patients with stage IV metastatic or unresectable UC in
a phase 2/3 study of 2 different Cb-based regimens.23
Gemcitabine is also frequently used in patients with UC in
combination with Cis or Cb.21,24-28 Gemcitabine in combination with a platinum-agent has been associated with
increased thrombotic and vascular side effects14,29-31 in
contrast to studies regarding its use as a single agent in the
treatment of UC.27,32,33
In the treatment of stage IV metastatic or unresectable cancers, VEGF inhibitors have been added to standard chemotherapy agents to improve overall survival,
albeit at the expense of an apparent increased incidence of
VTEs. A large meta-analysis (7956 patients) demonstrated higher rates of all-grade (11.9%) and high-grade
(6.3%) VTEs in patients treated with the VEGF inhibitor
bevacizumab (Bev) compared with non-VEGF controls.34
Another pooled analysis of patients with breast, colon,
and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients demonstrated an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic
events.35 Other VEGF-targeted therapies (sunitinib, sorafenib) also have been associated with an increased incidence of arterial thromboembolism.36
The role of Bev in VTE risk in patients with stage IV
metastatic or unresectable UC and other cancers is controversial. A phase 2 study in 43 chemotherapy-naive
Cancer

patients treated with gemcitabine, Cis, and Bev (GCisBev) reported an overall response rate of 72% and a median overall survival of 19.1 months,37 both of which are
improvements to historical data.21 However, the rate of
DVT/PE was 41% in the initial 17 patients, with an additional patient experiencing sudden cardiac death. After a
protocol amendment reduced the gemcitabine dose from
1250 mg/m2 to 1000 mg/m2, the DVT/PE rate in the
remaining patients decreased to 8%, resulting in a final
overall rate of DVT/PE of 21%. To our knowledge, the
largest published trial to date exploring gemcitabine, Cb,
and Bev (GCbBev) was a phase 3 randomized controlled
trial among women with platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancers. In this trial of
484 women, the VTE rates of GCb with or without Bev
were 6.9% and 3.5%, respectively.38 In contrast, a prospective phase 2 study of GCbBev in patients with stage
IV metastatic or unresectable UC who were considered
unfit for Cis-based therapy reported a DVT/PE incidence
of 20%.39
The concerning rate of VTEs in patients with UC,
specifically those treated with platinum analogs and
VEGF-targeted therapies, prompted us to conduct the
current study. The primary objective of this analysis was
to determine the incidence of VTE in patients with UC
who were treated with platinum agents (Cis or Cb) alone
or in combination with Bev.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The study design, data ascertainment, and data analysis
are outlined in a Consolidated Standards of Reporting
Trials (CONSORT) diagram (Fig. 1). Data from previously untreated patients with stage IV metastatic or unresectable UC who were prospectively registered to an
Institutional Review Board-approved protocol of
GCbBev from June 2006 to November 2010 were
reviewed Table 1. The treatment schedule was 1 loading
dose of Bev of 10 mg/kg followed 2 weeks later by 6 cycles
of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 on day 1 and day 8) plus
Cb (area under the curve [AUC] of 5 or 4.5 based on physician determination of patient ability to tolerate higher
doses of drug) and Bev at a dose of 15 mg/kg on day 1 every 21 days followed by maintenance Bev at 21-day intervals for 1 year. Two contemporary chemotherapy-naive
control groups with stage IV metastatic or unresectable
UC who received GCb or GCis for a planned 6 cycles
were retrospectively identified. The contemporary control group’s chemotherapy dosing (dose levels,

Statistical Analysis

Associations between chemotherapy regimen cohort and
categorical characteristics were analyzed using the Fisher
exact test. The number of metastatic sites and Khorana
risk score were treated as continuous variables, and their
associations with chemotherapy regimen cohort were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Because there were
differences in patient characteristics by chemotherapy regimen received, risk factors associated with VTE were analyzed using conditional logistic regression, with the
chemotherapy regimen cohort as the stratification variable. Statistical significance was defined as a P value < .05.
Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software
(version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Characteristics of the 198 patients by treatment group are
shown in Table 2. The majority of patients were treated
with Cb-based therapy (143 patients) in contrast to Cisbased therapy (55 patients). As expected, most primary
tumors were in the bladder for all cohorts (60.8%-76.4%)
and the majority of patients had pure transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) histology (61.8%-80.4%). Differences in
age distributions were observed among the 3 treatment
groups. The GCb cohort included the highest percentage
of patients aged 65 years (81.5%), followed by the
GCbBev cohort (60.8%), with substantially fewer
patients of that age noted among those treated with GCis
(38.2%) (P < .001).

When comparing baseline characteristics of patients
treated with the 3 chemotherapy regimens, age (65 years
vs > 65 years; P<.001), prior cystectomy (P<.001), tumor near pelvic vessels (P 5 .027), Khorana risk group
(P 5 .025), and receipt of antiplatelet therapy (P 5 .036)
were found to be significantly associated with chemotherapy regimen, reflecting cohort-specific differences. In contrast, other baseline characteristics including race, sex,
KPS, bladder (vs nonbladder) primary tumors, and pure
TCC versus TCC with foci of mixed histologies did not
differ by treatment type.
All patients in the current study had stage IV metastatic and/or unresectable UC. Differences existed with
regard to the percentage of patients who had undergone a
prior cystectomy and then developed disease recurrence
with stage IV metastatic disease versus those who presented de novo with unresectable or metastatic disease. A
prior cystectomy had been less frequently performed in
the cohort treated with GCis (5.5%). Consequently,
there was a higher rate of existing tumors near pelvic vessels before chemotherapy in this group of patients
(69.1%). In contrast, greater than one-half of the patients
on the prospective trial of GCbBev (64.7%) had undergone prior surgery. Although the reasons for this difference in prior cystectomy rates are unknown, it is likely a
consequence of the nature of the study selecting all
patients during a specific window of time during which
the GCbBev trial was conducted (Fig. 1). Although an
analysis of time from prior cystectomy was not performed, we did collect data regarding pelvic surgery
within 3 months of the initiation of chemotherapy and

found no significant difference between treatment groups
or an association with VTE. The majority of patients had
either 1 or 2 MSKCC poor-risk features, and the rate of a
KPS 70 ranged from 11.8% to 23.9% in the treatment
groups; neither factor differed by treatment group
(P 5 .225 and P 5 .124, respectively).
The Khorana risk score is a validated prediction
model designed to risk-stratify patients with cancers
undergoing systemic chemotherapy for their treatmentrelated thrombosis risk (Table 3).5,10 The score is derived
using 5 predictive variables: site of cancer, platelet count
350,000, hemoglobin < 10 g/dL and/or use of ESAs,
white blood cell count >11,000, and a body mass index
35 kg/m2. The majority of patients in each cohort were
categorized as Khorana risk group 1 or group 2 with
80.4%, 72.7%, and 69.6% of patients, respectively, in the
GCbBev, GCis, and GCb categories. At least one-half of
all patients had been exposed to ESAs and/or had central
venous access devices. Finally, the use of antiplatelet therapy was unevenly distributed across the 3 groups, with
approximately 50% fewer patients in the GCis cohort
receiving therapy compared with either of the other
cohorts (P 5 .036).
The incidence of VTEs with each chemotherapy regimen is shown in Table 4. VTEs occurred in 13 of 51
patients treated with GCbBev (26%), 22 of 92 patients
treated with GCb (24%), and 8 of 55 patients treated
with GCis (15%). The combined VTE incidence in
patients treated with Cb was 24%. The number of VTEs
that were subclinical and identified on routine computed
tomography (CT) scanning were 6 of 13 in patients
treated with GCbBev, 8 of 22 in patients treated with

dence of VTE (P 5 .300) or type of VTE (P 5 .111) did
not appear to differ by treatment type on univariate analysis (Table 4). We also evaluated associations between
patient characteristics and VTEs using conditional logistic
regression (Table 5). The only factor found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of VTE was a history of prior cystectomy (odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.014.86 [P 5 .047]).
DISCUSSION
Although VTEs may lead to increased rates of morbidity
and mortality in patients with solid tumors who are
undergoing systemic chemotherapy, stage IV metastatic
or unresectable UC is associated with only a moderate risk
of VTE. Based on the incidence of VTE in patients treated
on an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol of
GCbBev, which was found to be higher than the incidence historically observed in patients treated with
standard-of-care GCis chemotherapy,39,40 we sought to
further characterize the incidence of VTEs in patients
with UC receiving platinum-based chemotherapy. The
current study observed a continued high incidence of
VTEs regardless of the platinum analog used, with a particularly high incidence noted among those who received
Cb-based treatment (24%). Although the VTE incidence
noted with Cb-based therapy (24%) was not statistically
different from that of patients treated with Cis-based regimens (15%), it does raise clinical concerns. VTEs were
not reported as common adverse events in patients treated
with Cb in what to our knowledge was the largest Cbbased phase 2/3 trial focused on severe acute toxicity using
the Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 (death, grade 4
thrombocytopenia with bleeding, grade 3 renal toxicity,
neutropenic fever, or grade 3 mucositis) in patients with
UC performed to date. Since that trial did not report any
VTEs among 238 patients treated with 2 different Cb regimens, the impression has been that VTEs with Cb-based
therapy are not common.23

The frequency of VTEs associated with gemcitabine
dose, Cb, and the addition of Bev is controversial. The
VTE impact of Bev in ovarian cancer has been determined. A phase 3 trial in 484 patients with ovarian cancer
treated with GCb with or without Bev (gemcitabine at a
dose of 1000 mg/m2 per dose and Cb at an AUC of 4)
reported a 3.5% VTE rate in the 2-drug arm and a 6.9%
VTE rate in those receiving all 3 drugs, suggesting that
Bev does not increase the risk of VTEs when patients with
ovarian cancer are treated with this 3-drug regimen.38
Some studies have suggested that higher doses of gemcitabine result in higher rates of VTE. A small trial in patients
with NSCLC used a dosing regimen (gemcitabine at
1000 mg/m2 and Cb at an AUC of 5) similar to the current study’s trial of GCbBev and reported a VTE rate of
2.1%.41 In contrast, another NSCLC trial used a gemcitabine dose of 2000 mg/m2 and a Cb dose of AUC of 3 every other week and reported a 17.1% incidence.42 A
higher gemcitabine dose causing a higher rate of VTEs in
patients with UC was raised in the phase 2 trial of GCisBev.37 DVT/PEs at a gemcitabine dose of 1250 mg/m2
were noted among 7 of the initial 17 patients (41%).
However, some of these were asymptomatic, incidental
PEs that were observed on posttreatment CT scans of the
chest. Nonetheless, this observation prompted the investigators to reduce the dose of gemcitabine from 1250 mg/
m2 per dose to 1000 mg/m2 per dose, after which they
observed a much lower rate of VTEs of 8% in the remaining 36 patients. The overall rate for the 43 patients,
including both incidental and clinically apparent VTEs,
was 21% and thus was similar to the incidence noted in
other studies as well as ours. Similar to that trial, the current study also identified subclinical PEs on routine CT
scanning of the chest performed after chemotherapy. In
addition to differences in disease states and chemotherapy
doses, reported VTE rates also may suffer from methodological and reporting differences. The GCisBev study
reported all VTE events, the ovarian study reported only
those that were  grade 3, and a review of methods from
various studies have demonstrated that it is inconsistently
Cancer

VTE in Urothelial Cancer/Tully et al

reported whether VTEs include those from all causes
while receiving treatment (such as the current study) or
only those that are deemed specifically related to treatment. Fortunately for patients with UC, both the definitive impact of Bev on the risk of VTEs and the baseline
incidence of VTEs in patients with UC treated with
standard-dose Cis and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2/dose)
will be addressed by an ongoing randomized trial of GC
with or without Bev in patients with unresectable or metastatic disease.37
Although urothelial, thoracic, and gynecologic
malignancies treated with systemic chemotherapy are
believed to have a similar risk of VTE,10 this generalization may be inaccurate. The reported VTE incidence in
patients with UC treated with Cb reported in the current
study is to the best of our knowledge the highest reported
incidence of VTE among patients treated with this therapy, and is in fact higher than that noted in patients with
NSCLC and ovarian cancer at routine doses of gemcitabine and Cb. It could be hypothesized that the higher
incidence of VTEs noted in patients with UC in contrast
to those with NSCLC is due to higher rates of pelvic surgery. Patients with ovarian cancer also undergo pelvic surgery before chemotherapy, suggesting that surgery alone
does not explain these findings. Methodologic considerations also may play a role. Whether posttreatment CT
scanning of the chest was performed routinely in ovarian
cancer studies is also not routinely reported, thus potentially missing subclinical PEs. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that UC may have a higher intrinsic VTE rate than
other solid tumors when treated with chemotherapy.
Previous radical cystectomy was found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of VTE (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.01-4.86) in an analysis stratified by
chemotherapy regimen; this observation raises questions
regarding the thrombogenic nature of cystectomy. Radical
cystectomy may increase local prothrombogenic factors
and increase the propensity for VTEs. Although we would
not use this finding to recommend empiric VTE prophylaxis in patients who have undergone a radical cystectomy
and are receiving platinum-based treatments, future
research into whether the postsurgical state enhances VTE
risk in platinum-treated patients is warranted.
The Khorana risk score, a predictive model for
chemotherapy-associated thrombosis, was not found to be
associated with the odds of VTE in this study.10 This lack
of an impact may have been the result of different patient
populations in the 2 studies. The study by Khorana et al
included only patients who received a maximum of 4
cycles of chemotherapy (in contrast to 6 cycles in the curCancer

March 1, 2016

rent study), evaluated patients with different cancers (of
which gastrointestinal and lung were most frequent),
included only venous thromboembolic events (vs both venous and arterial events), and had differences in baseline
risk classifications. Although approximately 27% of
patients were considered low risk (Khorana score of 0) in
the study by Khorana et al,5 there were no low-risk
patients in the current study population due to the finding
that all patients had urothelial primary tumors (which are
scored as high-risk sites of disease in the predictive
model). This lack of low-risk patients in the MSKCC
study resulted in a higher incidence of high-risk patients
(26.8% vs 11%) and intermediate-risk patients (73.2% vs
60%), respectively, compared with the patient population
in the study by Khorana et al.5
A clear limitation of any retrospective analysis across
chemotherapy regimens is the potential baseline differences between cohorts and as-yet unknown risk factors. As
was demonstrated in Table 3, age, prior cystectomy, tumor near pelvic vessels, Khorana risk group, and baseline
antiplatelet therapy were all significantly associated with
treatment cohort (all P<.05). Given the heterogeneity of
the cohorts, other potential contributing factors may have
played a role in the development of VTEs, including
inflammation associated with malignancy that can result
in changes in the coagulation cascade such as fibrinogen,
von Willebrand factor, or factor VIII.43 These considerations raise the issue of clinical recommendations for the
high rate of VTE noted in this patient population as a
consequence of the findings of the current study and
whether all patients should receive prophylactic anticoagulation. Such an approach may be problematic in
patients with UC. Frequently, these patients experience
hematuria from ongoing primary tumors that may be
worsened with anticoagulation. Prophylaxis for all
patients may be cost-prohibitive given the potential benefit for only a minority of patients. Our group is now seeking to identify “high-risk” patients on a genetic basis in
whom earlier intervention may be possible. We currently
are funded to perform a genome-wide association study
examining for germline variations that may predispose a
patient toward an enhanced risk of VTE. This genomewide association study will be performed in approximately
800 patients with UC, including both a larger group of
patients at MSKCC as well as patients with UC participating in the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology cancer cooperative group study of GC plus Bev
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00942331).

chemotherapy are at high risk of VTE. The incidence of
VTE observed with Cb therapy was higher than expected
given the limited information from the existing Cb literature and a contemporary prospective study in ovarian cancer. Any impact of Bev on the incidence of VTE will be
addressed by the Alliance phase 3 trial comparing GCis
with GCis plus Bev. These observations add to our understanding of the adverse effects associated with platinumbased therapy for patients with advanced UC, although
the causes and impact of chemotherapy-associated VTEs
warrant further investigation.
