Summary
Synthetic and collateral lethality have provided conceptual frameworks to identify cancer-specific
vulnerabilities1–3. Here, we explored an approach to identify potential synthetic lethal interactions
through screening mutually exclusive deletion patterns in cancer genomes. We sought to identify
‘synthetic essential’ genes, which might be occasionally deleted in some cancers but almost
always retained in the context of a specific tumor suppressor deficiency, and posited that such

synthetic essential genes would be therapeutic targets in cancers harboring specific tumor
suppressor deficiencies. In addition to known synthetic lethal interactions, this approach
uncovered the chromatin helicase DNA-binding factor CHD1 as a putative synthetic essential gene
in PTEN-deleted cancers. In PTEN-deleted prostate and breast cancers, functional analysis
showed that CHD1 depletion profoundly and specifically suppressed cell proliferation, survival
and tumorigenic potential. Mechanistically, functional PTEN stimulates GSK3β-mediated
phosphorylation of CHD1 degron domains, which promotes CHD1 degradation via β-TrCPmediated ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Conversely, PTEN deficiency results in CHD1
protein stabilization, which in turn engages the H3K4me3 mark to activate transcription of the protumorigenic TNFα/NF-κB gene network. Together, this study identifies a novel PTEN pathway in
cancer and provides a framework for the discovery of trackable targets in cancers harboring
specific tumor suppressor deficiencies.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United
States, with 220,800 new cases and 27,540 deaths annually (NCI SEER 2015). Up to 70% of
primary prostate tumors show loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the PTEN locus4. In mouse
models, prostate-specific Pten deletion (Ptenpc−/−) results in prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (PIN) that may progress to high-grade adenocarcinoma after a long latency5, a
pattern consistent with loss of PTEN as a key initiation event in PCa development. To date,
therapeutic targeting of the PTEN-PI3K-AKT pathway has yielded meager clinical benefit,
prompting continued effort to identify obligate effectors of this important pathway in order
to illuminate effective therapeutic targets for PTEN-deficient cancers.

The notion of targeting synthetic lethal vulnerabilities in cancer has been validated in the
treatment of cancers harboring specific loss-of-function mutations1,6. One celebrated
example is the effectiveness of poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in BRCA
deficient tumors2,7. More recently, collateral lethality has emerged as another target
discovery strategy for cancers harboring tumor suppressor gene deletions that also delete
neighboring genes encoding functionally redundant essential activities thereby creating
cancer-specific vulnerabilities3,8. Genomic analyses have also been helpful in establishing
functional interactions of components in specific pathways that show mutually exclusive
patterns of genomic alterations. Such epistatic patterns include components of the RB or p53
pathways, where alterations in one gene of the pathway typically alleviates genetic pressure
to alter another driver in the same pathway consistent with minimal additional selective
advantage to the cancer cell9,10.

Taking advantage of the vast publically available cancer genome database, we sought to
establish and validate an approach to identify potential synthetic lethality interactions in
cancer via screening for mutually exclusive deletion patterns in the cancer genome. More
specifically, we searched for genes that might occasionally be deleted in some cancers (i.e., a
non-essential gene) but always retained in the context of deletion of a specific tumor
suppressor, reasoning that the retained gene might be required for executing the cancer
promoting actions in the context of a specific tumor suppressor deficiency (i.e., a ‘synthetic
essential’ gene). By extension, we posited that inhibition of such synthetic essential genes
would impair the survival and tumorigenic potential of cancer cells harboring the specific

tumor suppressor deficiency. Here, we focused on PCa due to the frequent and early deletion
of the PTEN tumor suppressor and the paucity of actionable ‘oncogene’ targets in PCa.

The well-established synthetic lethal interaction of BRCA1/PARP1 provides a measure of
validation for our approach since a mutually exclusive deletion pattern of BRCA1 and
PARP1 is readily observed in the PCa TCGA database (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Along
similar lines, and consistent with preclinical and clinical studies suggesting PTENdeficiency sensitizes prostate, colorectal and endometrial cancer cells to PARP
inhibitors11,12, we observed a synthetic essential relationship between PTEN and PARP1
(Extended Data Fig. 1b). Another mutually exclusive deletion pattern in PCa points to an
interaction between PTEN and polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). This
observation aligns well with the single-agent antitumor activity of the PLK4 inhibitor,
CFI-400945 and its capacity to induce significant regression of PTEN-deficient cancers,
compared with PTEN-intact cancer cells13. Together, these circumstantial data prompted us
to speculate that druggable essential dependencies (synthetic essential genes) of specific
tumor suppressor gene deficiencies might be uncovered by scanning the patterns of cancer
genome deletions.

Large-scale genomic analyses of the TCGA and other PCa databases identified CHD1 (5q21
locus) as a locus that is deleted in some human PCa cases (7–10%)14–16 yet consistently
retained in PTEN-deleted PCa (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1c). Additionally, the
significant mutually exclusive pattern with PTEN deletion was only observed with CHD1
but not other CHD homologues (Extended Data Fig. 1d). The PTEN/CHD1 relationship was
reinforced by a strong negative correlation between CHD1 and PTEN expression in 127
prostatic hyperplasia and cancer TMA samples by immunohistochemistry analysis (P=0.001,
Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a–b). CHD1 deletion per se does not appear to play a
significant role in PCa development as suggested by the lack of neoplasia in a tissue
recombinant model using mouse prostate epithelial progenitor/stem cells with CHD1
deletion17. Rather, CHD1 expression correlates positively with a high Gleason Grade
(p=0.006, Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2c) and is increased in neoplastic Pten-deleted
murine prostatic epithelium compared to wild type controls (Extended Data Fig. 2d–e).
Collectively, these observations prompted us to consider the possibility that CHD1 may be
required for the progression of PCa driven by loss of PTEN.

To test the above hypothesis, shRNA-mediated depletion or CRISPR-directed nullizygous
mutation of CHD1 was performed in 4 PTEN deficient PCa cell lines (shRNA: human
LNCaP and PC-3 PCa cell lines, and mouse Pten/Smad4-null and PtenCaP8 PCa cell lines;
CRISPR: human LNCaP cell line). In these models, CHD1 suppression inhibited colony
formation and induced cell death (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2f–j), yet had minimal
impact on cell migration (Extended Data Fig. 2k). Moreover, CHD1 depletion attenuated
tumor growth of PC-3 and LNCaP in vivo (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2l–m) and,
correspondingly, these tumors exhibited a striking reduction in cell proliferation (Ki67) and
increase in apoptosis (Caspase-3) (Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 2n). Similarly,
administration of siCHD1 in established PTEN-deficient patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
tumors attenuated tumor progression (Extended Data Fig. 2o–p). However, CHD1 depletion
had minimal impact on colony formation or tumor growth of the PTEN-intact PCa cell lines-

22Rv1, RWPE-2 and DU145 (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3a–d). In sharp contrast,
CRISPR-mediated knockout of PTEN in DU145 cells sensitized these cells to CHD1
depletion both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 3c–d). Together, these
data support the view that CHD1 is a synthetic essential gene required for tumor growth of
PTEN-null PCa, – a functional relationship consistent with the mutually exclusive pattern of
PTEN and CHD1 deletions.

Exploration of the functional relationship between PTEN and CHD1 revealed that PTEN reexpression in PTEN-null PCa cell lines led to a significant decrease in CHD1 protein, but
not mRNA, levels (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3e). Correspondingly, transient ectopic
expression of GFP-PTEN suppressed CHD1 in PC-3 cells at the single cell level (Fig. 2b).
Time course studies revealed that AKT inhibitor (MK2206) treatment reduced CHD1
protein levels over a 6-hour period (Fig. 2c) and that PTEN re-expression reduced the halflife of CHD1 protein (Extended Data Fig. 3f), supporting a role for the PTEN-AKT axis in
the control of CHD1 protein levels. Moreover, compared to PTEN-intact cells, CHD1 was
observed to be more stable in PTEN-deficient cells (Extended Data Fig. 3f–h). To explore
the mechanisms governing CHD1 protein levels, we treated the PTEN wild-type benign
prostatic hyperplasia epithelial cell line, BPH1, with the proteasome inhibitor MG132,
resulting in marked accumulation of CHD1 in a time dependent manner (Fig. 3a). Moreover,
endogenous CHD1 was modified by ubiquitination (Extended Data Fig. 4a), and PTEN
over-expression dramatically enhanced CHD1 ubiquitination (Fig. 3b). Together, these data
raise the possibility that CHD1 degradation is controlled via the ubiquitination-proteasome
pathway in a PTEN-dependent manner.

To identify a specific E3 ligase governing CHD1 protein stability, consensus sequence
scanning of multiple E3 ligase interaction domains revealed two evolutionarily conserved
putative β-TrCP consensus-binding motifs (DSGXXS) at the N-terminal of CHD1- residues
23–28 (motif 1, DSGSAS) and 53–58 (motif 2, DSGSES) (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig.
4b). β-TrCP is an F-box protein, and acts as the substrate recognition subunit for the
SCFβ-TrCP (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligases, which mediate the
ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of various substrates including β-catenin, Yap
and IKB, among others18–20. The CHD1-β-TrCP link was fortified by documentation of the
endogenous interaction of CHD1 and β-TrCP using co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3d) and
by β-TrCP over-expression resulting in reduced CHD1 protein levels and enhanced CHD1
ubiquitination (Fig. 3e–f and Extended Data Fig. 4c). Conversely, shRNA-mediated
depletion of β-TrCP caused CHD1 accumulation and inhibited its ubiquitination (Extended
Data Fig. 4d–e). To investigate whether the β-TrCP binding motifs of CHD1 were indeed
involved in the regulation of CHD1 protein stability, wild-type V5-tagged CHD1 and two βTrCP binding motif mutants (DAGXXA) were introduced into BPH1 cells, followed by
analyses of CHD1 half-life, ubiquitination and β-TrCP interaction. These experiments
established that the motif 2 (DSGSES) serves as the major β-TrCP binding motif that
contributes to CHD1 ubiquitination and degradation (Extended Data Fig. 4f–h).
β-TrCP is known to specifically recognize and interact with phosphorylated substrates21.
Our analysis of CHD1 identified that both β-TrCP binding motifs harbor a GSK3β
consensus sequence-SXXXS (Extended Data Fig. 4i). Since GSK3β is a direct target of

AKT kinase and is inhibited upon AKT activation, it would be anticipated that PTEN loss
would impair GSK3β, resulting in decreased CHD1 phosphorylation and subsequent
ubiquitination. In line with this possibility, overexpression of GSK3β and its constitutively
active mutant (S9A) in LNCaP cells increased phosphorylation of CHD1 (Fig. 3g),
consistent with the role of GSK3β as a CHD1 kinase. This connection was reinforced by
documented endogenous interaction between GSK3β and CHD1 (Extended Data Fig. 4j) as
well as decreased CHD1 levels with enforced expression of GSK3β (Fig. 3h). Finally,
treatment with CHIR, an inhibitor of GSK3β, decreased CHD1 ubiquitination (Fig. 3i) and
blocked the negative effect of PTEN expression on CHD1 protein stability (Extended Data
Fig. 4k). Together, these data establish that the PTEN-AKT-GSK3β pathway regulates
CHD1 degradation via the β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination-proteasome pathway.

Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is known to be associated with
transcriptional activation, and CHD1 is known to selectively recognize and bind to
H3K4me3 to activate gene transcription22. In addition, CHD1 is involved in the maintenance
of open chromatin and cooperates with H3K4me3 to control pluripotency of murine
embryonic stem cells23. Correspondingly, co-IP studies in BPH1 cells confirmed that CHD1
binds to H3K4me3 (Extended Data Fig. 5a) and CHD1 depletion in LNCaP and PC-3 cells
revealed a significant reduction in the H3K4me3 mark (Extended Data Fig. 5b–c). To
determine the downstream transcriptional targets and pathways of CHD1 and H3K4me3 in
PTEN-null PCa cells, ChIP-seq was performed in control versus CHD1 knockdown PC-3
cells. ChIP-seq identified a total of 8,468 CHD1-binding sites and 26,826 H3K4me3enriched regions in control PC-3 cells, with 58.6% of CHD1 peaks overlapping with
H3K4me3 peaks (Fig. 4a). Confirming our experimental methodology, 81.4% of CHD1
binding sites showed reduced peak values in CHD1-depleted PC-3 cells (Fig. 4b and
Extended Data Fig. 5d). And, notably, 77.5% of H3K4me3 enriched regions’ peak values
concomitantly diminished in CHD1-depleted PC-3 cells as well (Fig. 4b and Extended Data
Fig. 5d), strongly supporting an unanticipated role for CHD1 in H3K4me3 maintenance in
PCa. In addition, pathway analysis of either the concomitantly regulated genes by CHD1/
H3K4me3 or the genes whose promoters are bound by CHD1 revealed a significant
enrichment of genes involved in the TNFα/NF-κB network (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig.
5e; Supplemental Table 1–2).

Next, microarray analysis was performed in CHD1-depleted PC-3 and LNCaP cells
(Supplemental Table 3–4). These expression profiles aligned with the above ChIP-seq data,
confirming TNFα/NF-κB as the top down-regulated hallmark pathway in CHD1-depleted
cells (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 5f–g). Among the Top 30 down-regulated genes in
shCHD1 PC-3, 10 were target genes of NF-κB (Extended Data Table 1). Notably, pathway
enrichment analysis uncovered that the TNFα/NF-κB pathway is activated in PTEN null
mouse prostate tissue (Extended Data Fig. 5h), suggesting that TNFα/NF-κB network
regulation is linked to the PTEN-CHD1 axis.
NF-κB is a key regulator of inflammation and plays important roles on PCa initiation and
progression24. Blockade of NF-κB alone or in combination with anti-androgen suppresses
the tumor growth and metastasis of PCa25,26. Those down-regulated genes in the TNFα/NFκB pathway identified by microarray analysis included genes that control tumor cell

proliferation (PTGS2/COX-2) and anti-apoptosis (IER3, BCL2 and SOD2), as well as
multiple cytokines that remodel the tumor microenvironment (CXCLs, IL1 and IL6)24
(Extended Data Fig. 5i). These gene expression results were further validated by qRT-PCR
(Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 5j) and, upon analysis of clinical samples in the TCGA PCa
database, expression of these TNFα/NF-κB pathway genes correlated positively with CHD1
expression (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Interestingly, although many direct target genes of NFκB were identified, we did not observe changes in total or activated NF-κB p65 when CHD1
was depleted (Extended Data Fig. 6b and Fig. 4h). Based on CHD1/H3K4me3 ChIP-seq
data, all 90 down-regulated genes in the TNFα/NF-κB pathway can be subdivided into three
categories: (a) genes bound by CHD1 and marked by H3K4me3 (41.1%), consistent with
direct transcriptional control of these genes by CHD1 presumably via its interaction with the
H3K4me3 mark; (b) genes not bound by CHD1 but showing decreased H3K4me3
enrichment upon CHD1 depletion (47.8%), possibly reflecting CHD1-directed maintenance
of H3K4me3 mark which activates target transcription; and (c) genes neither bound by
CHD1 nor marked by H3K4me3 (~10%), suggesting that they are indirectly regulated by
CHD1 and H4K4me3 (Extended Data Fig. 6c and Table 2). Thus, the majority (88.9%) of
down-regulated TNFα/NF-κB pathway genes are transcriptionally controlled by CHD1
directly or via its maintenance of the H3K4me3 mark. Finally, consistent with PTENCHD1-NF-κB pathway epistasis, enforced addition of several CHD1 target genes, such as
PTGS2 (PGE2), BMP2 and CSF2, rescued colony formation in PCa cells deficient for both
PTEN and CHD1 (Extended Data Fig. 6d).

Together, our data demonstrate that the epigenetic regulator CHD1 represents a prime
therapeutic target candidate in PTEN-deficient PCa, validating our in silico approach to
identifying synthetic essential genes. Furthermore, our study identified a novel PTEN
pathway linking PTEN and chromatin-mediated regulation of the cancer-relevant NF-κB
network. Specifically, mechanistic analyses identified PTEN → AKT → GSK3β → βTrCP-mediated degradation of CHD1 via the ubiquitination-proteasome process (Extended
Data Fig. 7a). In cancer, PTEN deficiency stabilizes CHD1, which engages and maintains
the H3K4me3 mark to activate cancer promoting gene expression including the NF-κB
network, which is known to promote PCa progression (Extended Data Fig. 7b). In addition
to PCa, the mutually exclusive deletion pattern of PTEN and CHD1 is also present in breast
and colorectal adenocarcinoma (Extended Data Fig. 7c). To evaluate potential roles for
CHD1 in breast cancer, shRNA-mediated depletion was introduced into two PTEN-deficient
(BT-549 and MDA-MB-468) and two PTEN-intact (MDA-MB-231 and T47D) breast cancer
cell lines. Consistent with the observation in PCa, suppression of CHD1 inhibited PTENdeficient breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth (Extended Data Fig. 7d–f), but
had minimal impact on PTEN-intact breast cancer cells (Extended Data Fig. 7g–h). One
caveat concerning CHD1 is its potential role as a key driver of carcinogenesis in some
cancer types regardless of PTEN status. In such cancers, one would expect consistent
retention of CHD1 across genotypes.
Finally, we explored the generality of the ‘synthetic essentiality’ concept. To that end, we
searched in silico for additional examples of candidate synthetic essential genes that might
serve an obligate role in effecting carcinogenesis and tumor maintenance. Analysis of the
PCa TCGA database revealed a number of additional candidates that are rarely deleted but

typically show increased expression in the context of a specific tumor suppressor gene
alteration, such as PTEN, TP53, SMAD4 and RB1 (Extended Data Table 3). Previous
studies have shown that inhibiting these putative synthetic essential genes could reduce cell
proliferation or lead to tumor regression in PCa and other cancer types, indicating their
potential roles in synthetic lethal interaction with putative tumor suppressors in a given
cancer type. Further functional analyses will be needed to verify synthetic essentiality of
these genes in cancer cells harboring specific tumor suppressor deficiencies, as well as to
determine potential regulatory interactions and cell essential mechanisms.

Author Manuscript

Although most synthetic lethal interactions often involve two genes in parallel pathways that
converge on the same essential biological process (e.g., convergence of BRCA and PARP on
DNA repair processes), the PTEN/CHD1 example indicates that genetic interactions can
also reside between components in the same pathway and that, in the case of the synthetic
essential gene CHD1, such genes can serve as an essential downstream effector for a specific
tumor suppressor gene deficiency. Together, our study provides a framework for the
discovery of targetable vulnerabilities in cancers harboring specific tumor suppressor
deficiencies.

Concerning reviewer’s comments “restoration of PTEN to ‘rescue’ the lethality of CHD1

model. Cancer cells (2 × 106) in PBS/Matrigel mixture were injected subcutaneously into 5week old male nude mice (Taconic) or NOD/SCID mice (Charles River) under deep
anesthesia. The sizes of resulting tumors were measured twice a week. Once the largest
tumor diameter reached the maximal tumor diameter allowed under our institutional
protocol, all mice were sacrificed and tumors were harvested and weighed. For patientderived xenograft (PDX) model, a PTEN-deficient PDX line (MDA-PCa-183, generated by
Dr. Nora M. Navone28) was selected from 7 candidates through detecting PTEN expression
and pAKT levels in tumor lysate by immunoblot. Patient-derived tumor fragments (3–
4mm3) were surgically xenografted under the skin of male SCID mice. When tumors
reached approximately 100 mm3, mice were assigned randomly into one of two treatment
groups. Each tumor was treated weekly (3 times total) with 12 μg control siRNA or siRNA
targeting CHD1 using MaxSuppressor™ In Vivo RNA-LANCEr II (Bioo Scientific,
#3410-01) following the standard protocol. Tumor volume was measured before first
treatment (start point) and 3 days after third treatment (end point). Both negative siRNA
control (#VC30002) and human CHD1 siRNA (SASI_Hs02_00331472; 00203194;
00203195) were HPLC purified and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All mouse experiments
were performed with the approval of the MD Anderson Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) under protocol number 1069. The maximal tumor diameter allowed by
IACUC is 1.5cm.
Immunoprecipitation (IP) and Immunoblot
For CHD1-IP, cells were lysed in a NP-40 buffer containing 50mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
150mM NaCl, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell
lysates (500 μl) were incubated with anti-CHD1 antibody (Cell signaling #4351S) or control
IgG overnight at 4°C. Magnetic or agarose beads (10μl, Novex, # 10003D) were added to

each sample. After 3 h, the beads were washed three times with NP-40 buffer, followed by
immunoblot. For V5-IP, cell lysates were incubated with anti-V5-tag mAb-Magnetic beads
(MBL International, #M167-9) for 3 h at 4°C. For ubiquitination assay, 48h after
transfection, cells were lysed in 1% SDS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1
mM DTT) and boiled for 15 min, followed by dilution of 5-fold in 50mM Tris-HCl buffer
and IP. Proteins were blotted following standard protocol. Antibodies specific for CHD1
(Cell Signaling, #4351S), PTEN (Cell Signaling, #9188S), S473P-AKT (Cell Signaling,
#3787S), β-TrCP (Cell Signaling, #4394S), H3K4me3 (Cell Signaling, #9751S), Flag
(Sigma, #F7425), HA (Santa Cruz, #sc-7392), GSK3β (Cell Signaling, #12456P), and βactin (Sigma, #A3854) were purchased. Phos-tag SDS PAGE (Wako Chemicals, SuperSep™
Phos-tag™, #192-17401) was used to detect phosphorylation of CHD1 following the
standard protocol.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Immunofluorescence (IF)

Author Manuscript

Eighty cases of human prostate hyperplasia and cancer samples were purchased from US
Biomax (PR807b) and the rest of the samples were acquired from the Prostate Tissue Bank
of MD Anderson Cancer Center (total N=127). IHC was performed as previously
described27. A pressure cooker (95°C 30 min followed by 120°C 10 sec) was used for
antigen retrieval using Antigen unmarking solution (Vector Laboratories). Antibodies
specific to CHD1 (Sigma, #HPA022236) and PTEN (Cell Signaling, #9188S) were
purchased. The human tissue sections were reviewed and scored in a blinded manner for
staining intensity 0–2 by a pathologist, Dr. Wenting Liao. For CHD1, high expression means
a staining score of 2, while low expression includes both staining scores 0 and 1. Slides were
scanned using Pannoramic 250 Flash III (3DHISTECH Ltd.) and images were captured
through Pannoramic Viewer software (3DHISTECH Ltd.). The procedures related to human
specimens were approved by MD Anderson’s Institutional Review Board under protocol
number #PA14-0420; human samples were obtained from MD Anderson tissue banks which
consented the patients for tissue collection for research purposes. PC-3 cells were infected
with GFP-PTEN lentiviral particles for 72 h, fixed and stained using CHD1 antibody
(Sigma, #HPA022236) following the standard protocol. Images were captured using a
fluorescence microscope (Leica DMi8).
Migration assay
Prostate cancer cells (1×104) were suspended in serum-free culture medium, and seeded into
24-well Transwell® Inserts (8.0 μm). Medium with serum was added to the remaining
receiver wells. After 24 h, the inside of each insert was gently swabbed, and crystal violet
solution was added for 1 hour staining.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq)
ChIP was performed as described29. Briefly, chromatin from formaldehyde-fixed cells
(control and CHD1 knockdown PC-3 cells, 10 ×106 cells for CHD1 antibody and 1×106
cells for H3K4me3 antibody) were cross-linked using 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes
and reactions were quenched by 0.125 M glycine for 5 minutes at room temperature. Cells
were lysed with ChIP lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 140
mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid) for 30 minutes on ice.

Chromatin fragmentation was performed using a Diagenode Bioruptor®Pico sonicator (30
secs on and 30 secs off for 45 cycles) to achieve a DNA shear length of 200 to 500
basepairs. Solubilized chromatin was then incubated overnight with their respective
antibody-Dynabead (Life Technologies) mixture (CHD1 antibody: Bethyl, #A301-218A;
H3K4me3 antibody: Abcam #ab8580). Immune complexes were then washed 3 times with
RIPA buffer, once with RIPA-500 (RIPA with 500 mM NaCl), and once with LiCl wash
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 250 mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5%
deoxycholic acid). Elution and reverse crosslinking were performed in direct elution buffer
(10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 5 mM EDTA, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS) with proteinase K (20
mg/ml) at 65°C overnight. Eluted DNA was purified using AMPure beads (BeckmanCoulter). Libraries were prepared using NEBNext Ultra DNA Library kit (E7370).
Sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument to generate a dataset
GSE91401. Reads were aligned to reference genome (hg 19) using BWA (Burrows-Wheeler
Aligner). Reads mapping to more than two genomic loci were ignored.
mRNA Expression Analysis and Microarray

Author Manuscript

Cells were lysed in TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen; #15596-026), followed by total RNA
isolation using the standard protocol. The RNA was further purified using RNeasy
(QIAGEN) according to manufacturer’s protocols, and reverse transcribed into cDNA using
the SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Quantitative Real-time
PCR was performed for target gene expression analysis using the SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems) and indicated primers as listed in Supplemental Table 5.
Microarray analysis was performed on RNA prepared from control and CHD1 knockdown
PC-3 or CHD1 knockout LNCaP cells (biological triplicates for control and each CHD1
shRNA or CHD1 KO) at the MD Anderson Microarray Core facility using the GeneChip®
Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) to generate a dataset GSE84970.
Differentially expressed genes between control and CHD1 depleted groups were subjected
to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The
GSE25140 dataset of wild-type and Pten deletion mouse prostate tissues was downloaded
from the NCBI GEO database repository, published in 201127. The raw data were processed
and analyzed by GenePattern using Expression File Creator Module (version 12.3) and
GSEA module (v17). The default GSEA basic parameters were used and t test was used as
the metric for ranking genes.
Computational Analysis of Human Prostate TCGA Data

Author Manuscript

A list of 60 down-regulated genes (fold change >2) in the TNFα/NF-κB pathway identified
by microarray analysis was generated as Extended Data Table 2. The mRNA expression zScores of each gene in 498 TCGA prostate cancer samples were downloaded from http://
www.cbioportal.org. The two-tailed Pearson correlations between CHD1 expression and
indicated genes were calculated using SPSS Statistics software (IBM), and p values were
determined by two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. The gene list was then ranked by Pearson’s
correlation with CHD1 expression. The heat map was generated using Microsoft Excel
Graded Color Scale function with a 3-color scale set at number of −1, 0, and 1. For the
analysis of mutual exclusiveness and gene expression listed in Extended Data Table 3, the

Statistics

Author Manuscript

Images of genomic alterations in TCGA database were captured from http://
www.cbioportal.org. Estimations of sample size were done taking into consideration
previous experience with animal strains, assay sensitivity and tissue collection methodology
used. The two-tailed Pearson correlation between CHD1 and PTEN or Gleason grades was
calculated using SPSS Statistics software (IBM), and P values were determined by twotailed Fisher’s exact test. The Student t test assuming two-tailed distributions was used to
calculate statistical significance between groups (GraphPad Prism 6 or Microsoft Excel). N
represents biological replicates. Error bars indicate standard deviation (S.D.). The P values
shown in tumor growth plot indicate the differences of tumor sizes at end-point. * P<0.05;
** P<0.01; *** P<0.001. For IPA analysis, we included all 50 “hallmark” gene sets of the
Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) as described30 as customized pathways. Then the
gene fold-change list generated from Microarray (Supplemental Table 3) or the peak-score
list generated from ChIP (Supplemental Table 1 or 2) was uploaded for IPA Core Analysis.
The filter threshold of microarray data was Fold changes (Ctrl vs. shCHD1) >1.5.

Gene B Description

NMT1 activity and protein expression were higher in human
colorectal cancer, gallbladder carcinoma and brain tumors.
NMT1 inhibition reduces cell proliferation and induces
apoptosis in melanoma cell lines and also blocks tumor
growth in vivo.

GALNT3 overexpression in multiple cancers, including
gastric, ovarian, pancreatic and lung. GALNT3 knockdown
in epithelial ovarian cancer cells led to sharp decrease of
cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

High rates of Pol III transcription are necessary for cancer
cells to sustain growth, and requires TFIIIB. BDP1 is a
component of TFIIIB.

Overexprssed in colon and breast cancer; Depletion of
RAD17 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells are highly
dependent on CDK7, and CDK7 inhibitor blocks tumor
growth in TNBC PDX model; A covalent CDK7 inhibitor,
THZ1, strongly reduces the proliferation and cell viability
of T-ALL cell lines.

NQ01 is expressed at high levels in numerous human
cancers, including breast, colon, cervix, lung, and pancreas;
NQ01 has potential as a therapeutic target for cancer
therapy.

MY06 overexpressed in prostate cancer and multiple cancer
types; MY06 knockdown attenuates prostate cancer cell
migration; shMY06 reduced cell growth and increased
apoptosis in colorectal cancer.

DHFR is essential for DNA precursor synthesis, thus it was
the first enzyme to be targeted for cancer chemotherapy.

HDAC2 is often significantly overexpressed in solid tumors;
its inactivation resulted in regression of tumor cell growth
and activation of cellular apoptosis.

PLK4 knockdown decreases in vivo growth of breast cancer
xenografts. PLK4 inhibitor, CFI-400945, had single-agent
antitumor activity in vivo, and induced significant
regression of PTEN-null TNBC and colon cancer,
suggesting PLK4 may be a PTEN-null therapeutic target.

PARP1 has a role in repair of single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) breaks. PARP1 is overexpressed in a number of
cancer types. PARP1 inhibitors prove highly effective
therapies for cancers with BRCAness.

Function in cancer

Gene A (PTEN, TP53, SMAD4 and RB1) represents the most common altered tumor suppressors in PCa. For each gene in the Gene B list the table shows
(1) mutual exclusiveness score (odds ratio score) with Gene A; (2) Gene B expression in Gene A deleted PCa samples (P<0.1); and (3) proposed functions
in cancer progression. P values were determined by two-tailed t-test.

Gene B Description

Author Manuscript

Gene B

SKA1 is overexpressed in gastric cancer and promotes cell
growth; SKA1 overexpression promotes prostate
tumourigenesis; SKA1 is required for metastasis and
cisplatin resistance of non-small cell lung cancer.

PATZ1 binds to other DNA binding structures to play an
important role in chromatin modeling and transcription
regulation; PATZ1 is overexpressed in colon carcinomas; Its
silencing inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation or increases
sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli of glioma cells; The
development of B-cell lymphomas, sarcomas, hepatocellular
carcinomas and lung adenomas in Patzl-knockout mice
supports its tumor suppressor function.

MBD2 is a very attractive target for cancer prevention and
treatment; Mbd2 deficiency dramatically reduces adenoma
burden and extends life span in a gene dosage- dependent
manner in mouse model.

XBP1 is activated in TNBC and has a pivotal role in the
tumorigenicity and progression of this human breast cancer
subtype; Depletion of XBP1 inhibited tumor growth and
tumor relapse.

ACLY is upregulated or activated in several types of
cancers, and its inhibition is known to induce proliferation
arrest in cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.
