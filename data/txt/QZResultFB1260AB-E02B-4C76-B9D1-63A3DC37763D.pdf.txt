BACKGROUND: A previous phase 3 trial demonstrated noninferiority in terms of overall survival for combined S-1 (an oral fluoropyrimidine) and carboplatin compared with combined paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line treatment for advanced nonâ€“small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). In the current study, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of combined S-1, carboplatin, and bevacizumab
followed by maintenance with S-1 and bevacizumab in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. METHODS:
Patients received carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve, 5 mg mL21 per minute) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) on day
1 plus oral S-1 (80 mg/m2 per day) on days 1 through 14 every 21 days for up to 6 cycles. For patients without disease progression, S-1
and bevacizumab were continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity developed. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were
enrolled in the phase 2 study; of these, 35 patients (72.9%) completed at least 4 cycles. Most toxicities of grade 3 were hematologic,
and no increase in relative incidence associated with maintenance with S-1 and bevacizumab was observed. The objective response
rate was 54.2% (95% confidence interval, 39.2%-68.6%), and the median progression-free survival was 6.8 months (95% confidence
interval, 4.3-8.2 months). CONCLUSIONS: The regimen of combined S-1, carboplatin, and bevacizumab followed by maintenance with
S-1 and bevacizumab was active and feasible as first-line treatment for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Cancer 2013;119:2275-81.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of death related to cancer worldwide, with nonâ€“small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 85% of lung cancer cases.1 For individuals with advanced or metastatic NSCLC, platinum-based chemotherapy is
the mainstay of first-line treatment2,3 on the basis of the moderate improvement in survival and quality of life it affords
compared with best supportive care alone.4
A phase 3 study, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E4599 trial, demonstrated that bevacizumab, a
humanized monoclonal antibody specific for vascular endothelial growth factor,5 given with paclitaxel and carboplatin
resulted in significant improvements in the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in individuals with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.6 A Japanese phase 2 study also indicated that bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin improved the ORR
and PFS compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin alone.7 In a confirmatory phase 3 study (the Avastin in Lung [AVAiL]
trial), the addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin and gemcitabine resulted in a significant improvements in the ORR and
PFS.8,9 These observations provide a rationale for combining bevacizumab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in individuals with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.

Original Article

S-1 (TS-1; Taiho Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) is an oral fluoropyrimidine agent that consists of tegafur (a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil), 5-chloro2,4-dihydroxypyridine, and potassium oxonate.10 It has
demonstrated activity and acceptable tolerability in phase
2 studies of patients with advanced NSCLC.11 Our previous phase 3 study demonstrated the noninferiority in
terms of OS as well as a favorable toxicity profile for S-1
and carboplatin compared with standard paclitaxel-carboplatin as first-line treatment for patients with advanced
NSCLC.12 Thus, our results indicated that the combination of S-1 and carboplatin is a valid option for the firstline treatment of such patients.
In addition to the enhanced efficacy of cytotoxic
chemotherapy observed with bevacizumab, preclinical
studies indicate that the combination of bevacizumab
with 5-fluorouracil derivatives results in increased antitumor activity.13,14 Therefore, we have now performed a
multicenter phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of S-1 and carboplatin in combination with bevacizumab followed by maintenance therapy with S-1 and
bevacizumab alone in chemotherapy-naive patients with
advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility

Eligible patients were required be aged 20 years and to
have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB
or IV nonsquamous NSCLC (diagnosed according to the
seventh edition of the International Union Against Cancer cancer staging manual) or recurrence of this condition
after surgery. The patients also were required to have
measurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1);
adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function; an
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1; and no tumor invasion into the trachea, main bronchi, or major vessels.
Exclusion criteria included hemoptysis (>2.5 mL of red
blood per episode), radiologic evidence of tumor invasion
or tumor abutting of major blood vessels, evidence of a
brain metastasis >1 cm, current or recent use of full-dose
anticoagulants, medically uncontrolled hypertension or a
history of thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorders, interstitial pneumonia recognized on a chest x-ray, supporting
radiation therapy occupying the pulmonary region in the
3 months before enrollment, and major surgery within
28 days before enrollment. The study was performed
according to good clinical practices and ethical principles
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each
2276

participating center, and all patients signed written
informed consent forms before enrollment. The trial has
been registered under University Medical Hospital Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry Identifier UMIN 000003698.
Study Design and Treatment

The study was designed as a prospective, multicenter,
single-arm phase 2 trial of first-line combination therapy
with S-1, carboplatin, and bevacizumab followed by
continuous maintenance therapy with S-1 and bevacizumab. The primary endpoint was treatment efficacy
measured as the ORR in patients who received at least 1
course of the initial combination therapy. OS, PFS, the
disease control ratio, and adverse events also were evaluated as secondary endpoints.
Patients received S-1 orally at a dose of 80 mg/m2
per day on days 1 through 14 as well as carboplatin at a
dose calculated to produce an area under the concentration-time curve of 5 mg mL21 per minute and bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion on
day 1. The combination therapy was repeated every 21
days for up to 4 to 6 cycles unless there was evidence of
disease progression or intolerance of the study treatment.
After 4 to 6 cycles of treatment with S-1, carboplatin,
and bevacizumab, patients who attained a complete
response (CR), a partial response (PR), or stable disease
(SD) continued to receive cycles of maintenance therapy
with S-1 and bevacizumab every 21 days until they had
evidence of disease progression or developed unacceptable toxicity. Administration of S-1 during the maintenance phase was interrupted if patients developed grade
4 neutropenia, a platelet count <50,000/lL, a serum
creatinine concentration 1.5 mg/dL, a serum total bilirubin concentration 2.0 mg/dL, a putative infection
with fever of at least 38 C, or severe diarrhea or stomatitis (grade 2 or higher). Treatment with S-1 and bevacizumab was resumed if the neutrophil count was 1500/
lL, the platelet count was 100,000/lL, the serum total
bilirubin concentration was <1.5 mg/dL, there was no
infection with fever of at least 38 C, and diarrhea or stomatitis was grade 1 or lower.
Subsequent cycles of treatment were withheld until
the following criteria were satisfied: neutrophil count,
1500/lL; platelet count, 100,000/lL; performance
status, 0 to 2; serum total bilirubin concentration,
1.5 mg/dL; weight loss, grade 2 or lower abnormal
electrolytes, peripheral nerve damage, and hepatotoxicity
(based on aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels); grade 3 or lower

hypertension; grade 2 or lower proteinuria; grade 0
hemoptysis or bleeding; and no infection with fever of
at least 38 C. The study therapy was stopped if grade 2
or higher hemoptysis developed or if bleeding persisted
after treatment of hemorrhage. Patients also were to be
removed from the study if the next treatment cycle had
not started within 42 days of the previous dosing as a
result of toxicity.
Baseline and Treatment Assessments

Baseline evaluations included medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, ECOG performance status, and laboratory analyses. Computed tomography
(CT) scans of the chest and abdomen, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) studies of the brain, and bone scintigraphy or positron emission tomography (PET)-CT studies
were performed for tumor assessment within 28 days of
initiation of the study treatment. CT scans of the chest
and abdomen were repeated every 2 cycles, brain MRI
studies were repeated every 3 months or on the appearance of any neurologic symptoms, and bone scintigraphy
or PET-CT studies were performed every 6 months or on
the appearance of any bone-related symptoms. All treatment responses were defined according to RECIST version 1.1. If a patient had a documented a CR or a PR,
then the respective response had to be confirmed 4 weeks
later. A patient was considered to have SD if their
response was confirmed and sustained for at least 6 weeks.
PFS was calculated from the date of enrollment to the
date of confirmation of progressive disease or the date of
death from any cause. PFS from the start of maintenance
therapy was calculated by subtracting the period of the
initial combination therapy from overall PFS. OS was calculated from the date of initial treatment to the date of
death from any cause. For patients with unknown death
status, OS was censored at the last date the patient was
known to be alive. Patients were assessed for toxicity
according version 4.0 of the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria.
Statistical Analysis

We assumed that an ORR of 50% for the study regimen
in eligible patients would indicate potential usefulness,
whereas an ORR of 30% would be the lower limit of interest. On the basis of these assumptions, our study was
designed to have a power of 80% and a 1-sided level of
type I error of 0.05, resulting in a requirement for 45
patients. A Simon 2-stage design (MiniMax) was adopted.
Nineteen patients were to be initially assessed for
response, and if more than 6 patients manifested a PR or a
Cancer

June 15, 2013

CR, then 26 additional patients would be added to the
assessment. Efficacy and safety analyses were planned for
patients who received at least 1 cycle of the treatment.
PFS and OS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier
method to estimate the median points with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Between April 2010 and October 2011, a total of 48
patients with recurrent or newly diagnosed, advanced
nonsquamous NSCLC were enrolled at 3 participating
centers. The baseline characteristics of all assigned patients
are provided in Table 1. The median age for the treated
patients was 65.5 years (range, 35-77 years), 33 patients
(68.8%) were men, 42 patients (87.5%) had adenocarcinoma histology, 40 patients (83.3%) had stage IV disease,
and 16 patients (33.3%) were never-smokers. Epidermal
growth factor receptor mutation status was evaluated in
42 patients (87.5%), and 4 individuals had activating
mutations identified.
Treatment Delivery

Patient disposition is illustrated in Figure 1. Overall, 35
patients (72.9%) completed at least 4 cycles of S-1 and
carboplatin combined with bevacizumab, and 29 patients
(60.4%) were shifted to subsequent maintenance therapy
with S-1 and bevacizumab and received a median of 4
cycles (range, 1-18 cycles). In the initial combination
phase, 13 of 48 patients (27.1%) experienced dose

myelosuppression. Among the 29 patients who received
maintenance therapy with S-1 and bevacizumab, 2 individuals (6.9%) underwent a dose reduction, and 20 individuals (69%) had a treatment delay.
Efficacy

Forty-eight patients were deemed eligible for evaluation
of treatment response. Twenty-six patients attained a PR,
and no patients attained a CR, yielding an ORR of 54.2%
(95% CI, 39.2%-68.6%) (Table 2). Eleven patients
(22.9%) had SD, yielding a disease control ratio
(CR 1 PR 1 SD) of 77.1% (95% CI, 67.2%-88%).
Eleven patients (22.9%) had progressive disease as their
best response. At a median follow-up of 13.9 months

months). Thirty-seven patients (77.1%) received subsequent chemotherapy regimens as poststudy treatment.
Safety Analysis

All 48 patients who received the study treatment were
deemed eligible for safety analysis. The major adverse
events for each treatment phase (initial and maintenance

3 and higher hematologic toxicities included neutropenia
(31.3%), thrombocytopenia (16.7%), anemia (10.5%),
and leukopenia (8.3%). Among the 29 patients who continued with S-1 plus bevacizumab during the maintenance phase, 4 patients (13.8%) had grade 3 neutropenia,
and 1 patient (3.4%) had grade 3 anemia during the period. Most nonhematologic adverse events were of mild to
moderate intensity (grade 1 or 2); those that were grade 3
or higher during the initial phase of the study treatment
included hypertension (8.3%), appetite loss (6.3%), diarrhea (6.3%), fatigue (2.1%), and intestinal perforation
(2.1%); whereas those during the maintenance phase
included proteinuria (6.9%), mucositis (3.4%), and diarrhea (3.4%). There were no clinically relevant bleeding
events during either treatment phase for any patient, and
there were no treatment-related deaths.
DISCUSSION
This multicenter phase 2 study is the first to evaluate the
efficacy and safety of a new regimen, S-1 and carboplatin
combined with bevacizumab followed by maintenance S1 and bevacizumab, for first-line treatment of patients
with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. We observed that
the combination was active, with an ORR of 54.2% (95%
CI, 39.2%-68.6%), which met the primary objective of
the study. At a median follow-up of 13.9 months, the median PFS was 6.8 months, and the median OS was 22.8
months. Our previous phase 3 study demonstrated that
the combination of S-1 and carboplatin was not inferior
relative to a standard paclitaxel-carboplatin regimen in
Cancer

terms of OS for chemotherapy-naive patients with
advanced NSCLC.12 The ORR for S-1 and carboplatin,
however, was significantly lower than that for paclitaxelcarboplatin (20.4% vs 29%; P 5 .019). This difference in
ORR also was apparent for patients who had nonsquamous NSCLC (18.8% vs 27.6%; P 5 .027).15 It is
believed that bevacizumab is targets the tumor vasculature, reducing interstitial pressure and increasing vessel
permeability, thereby resulting in enhanced tumor sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy.16,17 Although there are
limitations to comparisons of results among different
studies, the ORR (54.2%) obtained in the current trial is
indicative of increased antitumor activity of S-1 and carboplatin with the addition of bevacizumab.
Our trial also indicates a favorable toxicity profile
for the study treatment. All toxicities were manageable
with symptomatic treatment and dose reduction or interruption. In our previous phase 3 study, the combination
of S-1 and carboplatin was associated with significantly
lower rates of neutropenia, leukopenia, and febrile neutropenia compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin.12 Consistent with these results, most patients enrolled in the
current study had only mild hematologic toxicities, and
no cases of febrile neutropenia occurred. Thus, no obvious
exacerbation of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression
by the addition of bevacizumab to S-1 and carboplatin
was apparent. There also was no increase in the relative
incidence of hematologic toxicities associated with maintenance therapy with S-1 and bevacizumab. With regard
to nonhematologic toxicities, there were no grade 3 or 4
2279

Original Article

toxicities encountered in >10% of patients throughout
the study treatment. Mild or moderate fatigue and gastrointestinal adverse effects were the most frequent nonhematologic toxicities, consistent with findings from
previous studies with combined S-1 and carboplatin.12
Hypertension and proteinuria have been associated with
bevacizumab administration6,8 and also were observed in
the current study. Two patients experienced grade 3 proteinuria in the maintenance period; however, both cases
were fully reversible without dose reduction or cessation
of treatment. Because clinically significant (grade 3)
hemoptysis was observed in 0.9% to 1.9% of patients
who received bevacizumab in the ECOG E4599 and
AVAiL trials,6,8 the lack of fatal bleeding events and treatment-related deaths in the current study also is noteworthy. Patients with brain metastases have been excluded
from most clinical trials of bevacizumab for fear of intracranial hemorrhage.6,8 However, recent data suggest that
the risk of developing intracranial hemorrhage is independent of bevacizumab therapy in patients with NSCLC
who have brain metastases.18 Conversely, another study
suggested that intracranial hemorrhage is more likely to
become clinically symptomatic in larger (>2 cm) brain
metastases.19 On the basis of these data, patients with
brain metastases that measured <1 cm were eligible for
the current study. Indeed, 2 patients who had asymptomatic, small (<1 cm) brain metastases were enrolled in the
study, but no intracranial hemorrhage was observed.
Bevacizumab is used in the maintenance setting for
patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC on the basis of the results from the ECOG E4599 and AVAiL trials,
in which bevacizumab monotherapy after induction therapy with bevacizumab plus platinum doublets was administered until patients developed disease progression.6,8
More recently, a large phase 3 trial (PARAMOUNT)
demonstrated that maintenance therapy with pemetrexed
after induction therapy with pemetrexed and cisplatin
resulted in a significant improvement in PFS and OS.20
Furthermore, an ongoing ECOG phase 3 trial is comparing bevacizumab alone, pemetrexed alone, and the pemetrexed-bevacizumab combination for maintenance
therapy after initial therapy with paclitaxel, carboplatin,
and bevacizumab (National Clinical Trials identifier
NCT01107626). Thus, extensive efforts are under way to
examine the effects of the combination of bevacizumab
and chemotherapy during the maintenance phase of treatment for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. On the basis
of the low level of toxicity accumulation for S-1,21 we
explored the efficacy and feasibility of continued maintenance therapy with S-1 and bevacizumab in the current
2280

study. The favorable tolerability profile of maintenance
with S-1 and bevacizumab after induction therapy with S1, carboplatin, and bevacizumab is reflected in out observation that 60% of patients were able to continue on S-1
and bevacizumab for a median of 4 cycles (range, 1-18
cycles). Among the 29 patients who received maintenance
therapy with S-1 and bevacizumab, the median PFS of 8.2
months (95% CI, 7.4-9.6 months) from the beginning of
induction treatment is encouraging and compares favorably with that of 6.9 months reported in the PARAMOUNT study for maintenance with pemetrexed
monotherapy. Despite the limitations to comparisons of
results from different studies, these data may stimulate
further interest in the clinically relevant efficacy of maintenance therapy with S-1 and bevacizumab.
In conclusion, here, we have presented results from
the first phase 2 study of combined S-1, carboplatin, and
bevacizumab followed by maintenance therapy with S-1
and bevacizumab. Although our study was not randomized, the promising efficacy and favorable toxicity profile
of the study treatment justify further development of regimens that contain S-1 and bevacizumab. A large randomized phase 3 trial comparing single-agent S-1 with
docetaxel in previously treated patients with advanced
NSCLC in Asian countries is currently under way (JPRNJapicCTI-101155). We believe that further randomized
trials are warranted comparing S-1, carboplatin, and bevacizumab with the current standard of care (paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab) in previously untreated
patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC.
