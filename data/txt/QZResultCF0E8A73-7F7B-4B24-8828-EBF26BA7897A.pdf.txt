Summary
Following the discovery of BRD4 as a non-oncogene addiction target in acute myeloid leukemia
(AML)1,2, BET inhibitors are being explored as promising therapeutic avenue in numerous
cancers3–5. While clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced hematologic
malignancies6, mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly
understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukemia, we
performed a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in a sensitive MLL/AF9; NrasG12D -driven AML

model, and investigated dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistant murine and
human leukemias. Our screen reveals that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in
other contexts, promotes BET inhibitor resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does not directly
affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates the remodeling of regulatory
pathways that restore the transcription of key targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition
triggers acute MYC repression in human leukemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant
leukemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC transcription. This
process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT signaling components, which compensate
for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance in various cancer models. Dynamic ChIP- and STARRseq enhancer profiles reveal that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodeled regulatory
landscapes, involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in
response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT signaling as a driver
and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET resistance in leukemia, and implicate the
rewiring of transcriptional programs as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET
inhibitors and, potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies.

BRD4 is a chromatin reader that regulates transcription through linking histone acetylation
and core components of the transcriptional apparatus7. Recent studies suggest that BRD4
regulates distinct gene sets through interacting with context-specific enhancers and
transcription factors8,9. However, the mechanisms underlying the wide range of sensitivity
to BET inhibition remain elusive, and so far no predictive biomarker could be identified.
Towards understanding these mechanisms, we sought to functionally identify chromatin
factors that are required for rendering AML cells sensitive to JQ1, a well-known BET
inhibitor10. To this end, we constructed a microRNA-embedded short hairpin RNA
(shRNAmir) library covering 626 chromatin regulators and screened it in the same MLL/
AF9;NrasG12D-driven model that led to the identification of BRD4 as a candidate target1
(Fig. 1a). Deep-sequencing following transduction (T0) and seven days of selection (T1)
identified chromatin-associated dependencies, including Smarca4 and Brd4 as top hits
(Extended Data Fig. 1a-c). To control for unspecific events, we mixed the GFP+ library
population with mCherry+ control cells, and subsequently treated with DMSO or JQ1. While
mCherry+ cells disappeared over time (Fig. 1b), GFP+ cells survived and eventually grew in
the presence of 50 nM JQ1 (corresponding to an IC70 dose; Extended Data Fig. 1d),
indicating that resistance emerged from shRNA-mediated effects. Four shRNAs showed an
outstanding enrichment that was consistent between replicates, despite almost five weeks of
independent culture (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 1a,e). These included two shRNAs
targeting Suz12, one targeting Psip1, and one previously characterized potent Dnmt3a
shRNA11. All four shRNAs strongly suppressed their target mRNA (Extended Data Fig.1f),
and validated to promote JQ1 resistance in single assays (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 2a).
The finding that suppression of Suz12, a component of the PRC2 complex, promotes
resistance to JQ1 was surprising in two ways. First, a recent report, based on studies in nerve
sheath tumors, has implicated Suz12 deficiency as a condition that sensitizes to BET
inhibition12. Second, several studies (including work from our group) have characterized
PRC2 as a requirement in MLL/AF9-driven AML13,14. Interestingly, the most potent Suz12
shRNA in previous studies (Suz12.1676) did not score in the pooled screen and validated to

strongly inhibit proliferation in our model (Fig. 1e). However, when we added JQ1,
Suz12.1676-expressing cells rapidly enriched, indicating that Suz12 deficiency turns from a
detrimental into a favorable condition. Similar effects were observed using potent shRNAs
targeting Ezh2 and Eed, two other PRC2 components (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2b). We
also validated this phenomenon using Tet-regulatable RNAi, where we included a validated
Myc shRNA15 to rule out that resistance is merely a consequence of reduced proliferation
(Extended Data Fig. 2c). Resistant cells generated through Suz12 suppression showed a
global loss of H3K27me3 (Fig. 1f), and were also refractory to the effects of JQ1 in methylcellulose assays (Extended Data Fig. 2d) and in vivo (Fig. 1g). While recipient mice of
Suz12-deficient cells, consistent with previous observations14, showed a delayed disease
progression, JQ1 had no anti-leukemic effects in this context (Fig. 1g). Together, these data
demonstrate that loss of Suz12 impairs rather than promotes BET sensitivity in AML,
revealing another scenario where PRC2 plays opposing roles in different cancers.
To search for underlying mechanisms, we investigated whether our hits affected the
regulation of BRD4-dependent transcripts, and found that the acute response to JQ1 is
largely unchanged in the absence of Suz12, Dnmt3a or Psip1 (Fig. 2a). However, under
long-term treatment 60-80% of JQ1-induced changes reverted and transcription of the key
target Myc1,3 was restored (Fig. 2a-c; Extended Data Fig. 2e). To investigate this rebound
phenomenon, we focused subsequent analyses on PRC2, a writer of repressive H3K27me3
marks16. Based on recent reports showing that BRD4 interacts with WHSC1L117, a writer
of H3K36 methylation marks that can recruit PRC218, we wondered whether PRC2 is
involved in repressing BRD4 targets following BET inhibition. However, ChIPseq analysis
before and after JQ1 treatment showed no increase in H3K27me3 at Brd4 occupancy sites
(Extended Data Fig. 2f,g), which together with RNAseq studies suggests that PRC2 does not
regulate these genes directly.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Next, we investigated whether the rebound of BRD4 targets is associated with changes in the
enhancer landscape. Under long-term JQ1 treatment, resistant cells showed a global loss of
enhancer-associated H3K27ac marks, which was reversible upon drug withdrawal (Extended
Data Fig. 3a). At the level of Myc, the loss of H3K27ac was most prominent at a 3’-cluster
of lineage-specific enhancers known to be required for Myc transcription19 (Fig. 2d). In
parallel, we observed a strong focal gain of H3K27ac in the first intron of Pvt1 (a lncRNA 3’
of Myc), which was the tenth most prominent of only 119 genomic regions that gained
H3K27ac in resistant cells (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Together, these findings reveal
that BET resistance is associated with profound changes in the enhancer landscape.
To probe regulatory pathways involved in the re-expression of Brd4 targets, we analyzed the
transcriptomes of sensitive and resistant cells generated using three independent PRC2
shRNAs (Fig. 2e). Gene set enrichment analysis20 identified alterations in five major
signaling pathways (Fig. 2f). Almost half of the genes associated with upregulated pathways
harbor H3K27me3 marks in sensitive cells (Extended Data Fig. 3d-f), indicating that loss of
PRC2 can facilitate their transcriptional activation. The most significant alteration was an
upregulation of genes associated with Wnt signaling, which can drive Myc transcription21
and has important functions in normal and leukemic stem cells (LSC)22,23. Of note,
resistant cells in our model were not enriched for LSC-associated surface markers and

expression signatures (Extended Data Fig. 4a-c), which does not exclude a role of LSC in
resistance. Collectively, our findings suggest that loss of PRC2 promotes resistance through
facilitating the derepression of compensatory pathways that restore the transcription of
critical BRD4 target genes.

Given this complexity, we sought to explore whether any phenomena in our model of
acquired resistance are also associated with primary BET resistance. To this end, we
determined the JQ1 sensitivity in 246 human cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 5a), and selected
3 sensitive and 3 resistant lines from 3 cancer subtypes for dynamic transcriptional profiling.
While RNAseq profiles distinguished cancer subtypes as expected, sensitive and resistant
contexts could not be differentiated, neither through their steady-state transcriptomes, nor
through comparing JQ1-induced changes (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). In fact, BET inhibition
triggered highly distinct responses regardless of whether MYC is affected, and even cancers
of similar tissue and sensitivity profile do not share greater overlaps (Fig. 3a, Extended Data
Fig. 5d-f). To test whether this heterogeneity is associated with differential functions of JQ1
targets, we used Tet-regulated shRNAmirs to profile BRD2/3/4-dependent transcripts in
sensitive and resistant leukemia cells. In both cases, JQ1-induced changes showed the largest
overlap with BRD4-knockdown profiles (Extended Data Fig. 6a-d), indicating that
suppression of BRD4 dominates the effects of BET inhibition in leukemia.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Despite this heterogeneity, a closer look at the few commonly regulated genes (Extended
Data Fig. 6e) revealed two interesting findings: (1) One of two transcripts commonly
induced by JQ1 was HEXIM1, which we found upregulated in all analyzed cancers
(Extended Data Fig. 6f), indicating that it could serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker. (2)
Surprisingly, one of three transcripts repressed after 2h of JQ1 in both sensitive and resistant
leukemias was MYC. In sensitive leukemias, this repression was durable and led to strong
suppression of the MYC protein (Fig. 3b), while all resistant leukemias showed a rapid
rebound of MYC transcription and, consequently, only minimal protein suppression. Similar
effects were observed in a larger panel of hematopoietic cell lines (Fig. 3c, Extended Data
Fig. 6g), indicating that primary BET resistance is not due to BRD4-independent regulation
of critical targets, but driven by compensatory mechanisms that rapidly restore their
transcription.
To investigate how this rebound phenomenon is encoded in the enhancer landscape, we
performed H3K27ac ChIPseq, which revealed that resistant K-562 cells harbor several
H3K27ac peaks around MYC that are missing in sensitive MOLM-13 cells. These include a
strong occupancy in the first intron of PVT1 (Fig. 3d), the same region that gained H3K27ac
in our mouse model (Fig. 2d). To systematically analyze how these putative MYC enhancers
change their activity upon BET inhibition, we performed STARR-seq (a new method for
high-throughput functional enhancer analysis24) using a library covering 3.1 MB
surrounding MYC (Extended Data Fig. 7a). While the PVT1 element had little activity in
DMSO-treated K-562 cells, its enhancer activity strongly increased after 24h of JQ1
treatment (Fig. 3e) and defined the single strongest gain in the entire region (Fig. 3f). We
confirmed this effect in conventional reporter assays using a minimal MYC promoter (Fig.
3g) and found that it does not correlate with PVT1 transcription (Extended Data Fig. 7b),
indicating that this element primarily acts as a MYC enhancer. Collectively, our results

suggest that the rebound of MYC is driven by a focal enhancer that is formed during
acquired resistance and pre-established in primary resistant cells.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To search for regulatory pathways driving primary resistance, we compared steady-state
transcriptomes of sensitive and resistant leukemias. Among only 38 genes consistently
upregulated in resistant leukemias, we identified 17 genes previously implicated as Wnt
signaling targets (Fig. 4a), which together with findings in our mouse model (Fig. 2f)
pointed at Wnt signaling as a candidate driver of BET resistance. From these 17 genes, we
selected two well-established Wnt targets, IGF2BP125 and TCF426, to test whether they
contribute to the resistant state of K-562 cells. Suppression of TCF4 or IGF2BP1 increased
the JQ1 sensitivity and diminished transcriptional rebound phenomena in K-562 cells (Fig.
4b,c; Extended Data Fig. 8a), while overexpression of TCF4 in MOLM-13 cells reduced
their sensitivity (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c).

To investigate whether resistant cells engage Wnt transcriptional machinery following BET
inhibition, we performed ChIP assays for TCF7L2, a Wnt-dependent transcription factor
known to drive MYC and other Wnt targets in complex with CTNNB121. Following JQ1
treatment, established Wnt target genes showed a marked increase in TCF7L2 binding,
which was particular prominent at the PVT1 element 3’ of MYC (Extended Data Fig. 8d),
suggesting that this site acts as a Wnt-dependent MYC enhancer. To test whether Wnt
activation drives denovo resistance, we transduced cells of our sensitive AML mouse model
with validated shRNAs targeting Apc (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f), a negative regulator of Wnt
signaling, or active mutants of Ctnnb1. While Wnt activation had no or slightly detrimental
effects in untreated cells, JQ1 treatment led to a rapid outgrowth of cells expressing two
independent Apc shRNAs or Ctnnb1 harboring 4 activating mutations (Ctnnb1.4x) (Fig.
4d,e; Extended Data Fig. 8g). Single-mutant Ctnnb1 had milder effects, indicating that the
degree of BET resistance depends on Wnt activation levels. Ctnnb1.4x also completely
blunted the response to JQ1 in vivo, and promoted resistance in two independent leukemia
models (Extended Data Fig. 8h,i).
After demonstrating that Wnt activation drives resistance in leukemia, we wondered whether
our Wnt expression signature would be more generally associated with BET resistance.
Through integrating sensitivity profiles of 246 cell lines with available transcriptome
data27,28, we found that expression of this gene set is significantly increased in JQ1resistant contexts (Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). As a first step towards probing Wnt as BET
resistance driver in other cancers, we found that suppression of Apc promotes resistance in a
mouse model of pancreatic cancer, while treatment with the Wnt inhibitor Pyrvinium29
synergizes with JQ1 in this model and highly resistant ASPC-1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 9ce). To probe whether Wnt-signaling is associated with BET resistance in primary human
leukemia, we quantified 9 Wnt-associated transcripts in sensitive and resistant patientderived samples (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Remarkably, three of these transcripts (i.e. TCF4,
CCND2 and HOXB4) were significantly overexpressed in resistant samples (Fig. 4f), while
others showed a similar trend (Extended Data Fig. 10b). To reduce context-specific biases of
single markers, we used the three significant transcripts to establish a simple “resistance
index”, which strongly correlated with IC50 values (Extended Data Fig. 10c) and may
provide a first step towards developing a predictive biomarker.

Through integrative profiling and functional genetics in mouse and human leukemia, our
study reveals that BRD4 regulates a remarkably specific and diverse set of target genes.
Leukemia cells, through an adaptation process that is facilitated by inactivation of PRC2,
can become resistant to BET inhibition by rewiring the transcriptional regulation of key
BRD4 targets such as MYC (Fig. 4g). Interestingly, a recent study found that in Tlymphoblastic leukemia MYC transcription can switch from a NOTCH1-dependent to a
BRD4-dependent mode under treatment with γ-secretase inhibitors30. Our study reveals
that the BRD4-dependency of MYC can be overcome through engaging a focal enhancer
and, together with another report31, establishes WNT signalling as a major driver and
candidate biomarker of BET resistance in leukaemia. These findings highlight that the
heterogeneity and plasticity of transcriptional machinery plays a major role in promoting
resistance to chromatin-targeted therapies.

Pooled shRNAmir screening

An shRNA library targeting 626 chromatin-associated mouse genes (Supplementary
Information; shRNAs prim. screen performance) was assembled in pLMN15 by combining
an existing chromatin-focused library (243 genes, 1094 shRNAs)1 and 1793 additional
shRNAs that were designed based on optimized Sensor rules32,33, and cloned, sequenceverified and pooled as previously described1. After spiking in several control shRNAs at
equimolar ratios, the final pool of 2917 pLMN-shRNAs was transduced in triplicate into the
same MLL-AF9/NrasG12D driven model that we had previously used to identify BRD4 as a
target in AML2. To ensure library representation a total of 60 million cells were infected
with 5% transduction efficiency using conditions that predominantly lead to a single
retroviral integration and represent each shRNA in a calculated number of >800 cells.
Throughout G418 drug selection (1 mg ml−1) more than 50 million cells were maintained at
each passage to preserve library representation. Two days after infection T0 samples were
acquired (6 million GFP+ cells per replicate) using a FACS AriaII (BD Biosciences) and
deep sequencing analysis confirmed that the library was well represented in all replicates.
After G418 drug selection for 7 days, T1 samples were obtained using FACS (6 million
GFP+ cells per replicate), and cells were subsequently cultured in the presence of 0.5 mg
ml−1 G418 (15 million cells per replicate were maintained at each passage). To control for
unspecific clonal events during the JQ1 resistance screen, stably selected cells were mixed in
4:1 ratio with G418-selected cells expressing an empty miR-30 cassette, mCherry and NeoR
(pMSCV-miR30.empty-PGK-NeoR-IRES-mCherry). Replicates were subsequently treated
for 4 days with 100 nM JQ1 followed by 50 nM JQ1 for 22 days. Culture medium was
exchanged every two days until cells proliferated comparable to wild type cells and
afterwards passaged 7 times. Three replica cultured in the presence of vehicle (0.033%
DMSO) were maintained in parallel. After 22 days (T2), about 6 million shRNA-expressing
(GFP+) cells were sorted for each replicate by FACS. While mCherry+ cells completely
disappeared over time, GFP+ cells survived and eventually grew in the presence of 50 nM
JQ1 (corresponding to an IC70 dose in this model), indicating that resistance did not emerge
from random clonal events, but from shRNA-mediated effects. Genomic DNA from T1 and
T2 samples was isolated by two rounds of phenol extraction using PhaseLock tubes
(5PRIME), followed by isopropanol precipitation. Deep sequencing libraries were generated
by PCR amplification of shRNA guide strands using primers that tag the product with
standard Illumina adapters (p7+Loop:
CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGATAGTGAAGCCACAGATGT; p5+PGK:
AATGATACGGCGACCACCGATGGATGTGGAATGTGTGCGAGG). For each sample,
DNA from at least 5 × 106 cells was used as template in multiple parallel 50-μl PCR
reactions, each containing 0.5 μg template, 1× AmpliTaq Gold buffer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP,
2 mM MgCl2, 0.3 μM of each primer and 2.5 U AmpliTaq Gold (Life Technologies), which
were run using the following cycling parameters: 95°C for 10 min; 35 cycles of 95°C for 30
s, 52°C for 45 s and 72°C for 60 s; 72°C for 7 min. PCR products (340 bp) were combined
for each sample, column purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and
further purified on a 1% agarose gel (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Qiagen). Libraries were
analyzed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 deep sequencer; 22 nucleotides of the guide strand
were sequenced using a custom primer (miR30EcoRISeq,

detecting shRNA depletion in experimental samples, we aimed to acquire >500 reads per
shRNA in the sequenced shRNA pool to compensate for variation in shRNA representation
inherent in the pooled plasmid preparation or introduced by PCR biases. With these
conditions, we acquired baselines of >500 reads for all 2917 shRNAs. Sequence processing
was performed using a customized Galaxy platform34. For each shRNA and condition, the
number of matching reads was normalized to the total number of library-specific reads per

(detailed protocols available upon request). Emerging tumors were characterized to harbor
histological features of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma and used to derive a cell line
(KRPC2), which was cultured in DMEM (Gibco-Invitrogen) with 10% FBS, 20 mM
Glutamate, 10 mM sodium pyruvate 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin.

Retroviral packaging was performed using Platinium-E cells (Cell Biolabs) according to
established protocols11. In brief, for each calcium phosphate transfection, 10‐20 μg plasmid
DNA and 5 μg helper plasmid (pCMV-Gag-Pol, Cell Biolabs) were used. Transduction
efficiencies of retroviral constructs were measured 48h post infection by flow cytometry
(Guava easyCyte, Millipore). Transduced cell populations were usually selected 48h post
infection using 500 μg/ml G418 (Gibco, Life Technologies). To generate resistant MLLAF9/NrasG12D murine leukemia, cells were transduced with retrovirally delivered shRNAs
or cDNAs at a transduction efficacy between 5-15% (predominantly yielding single viral
integrations per cell). JQ1 treatment was started post infection and medium was carefully
exchanged every two days to maintain a 50 nM JQ1 concentration until cells were
proliferating normally and daily passaging was required. The starting point of JQ1 treatment
is critical and can vary between different targets and shRNAs since the effect is dependent
on shRNA potency, protein half-life of the respective target and the half-life of the
associated chromatin mark. In case of strong detrimental effects the optimal start of JQ1
treatment needs to be determined for every target.
MOLM-13 and K-562 cells were modified to express the ecotropic receptor and rtTA3 using
retroviral transduction of pMSCV-RIEP (pMSCV-rtTA3-IRES-EcoR-PGK-Puro) or
lentiviral transduction of pWPXLd-RIEP (pWPXLd-rtTA3-IRES-EcoR-PGK-Puro)
followed by puromycin selection (0.5 and 1 ug ml−1 for 1 week, respectively). Derived cell
lines were subsequently transduced with ecotropically packaged retroviruses.

For flow cytometry immunophenotyping, cultured cells were collected and stained using the
indicated antibodies (two million cells in 100 μl FACS buffer: PBS, 5% FCS, 0.005%
sodium acetate, and human or mouse TruStain fcX Fc-receptor blocking agent (Biolegend)
for 20 min at 4°C. Antibodies were diluted 1:400. Stained samples were analyzed on an LSR
Fortessa (BD) flow cytometer. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software
(Treestar). Cell viability assays for drug IC50 and GI50 determination were performed using
Alamar blue staining according to manufacturer’s guidelines, or by counting the increase in
viable cell numbers over 72h in the presence of different JQ1 concentrations. Dead cells
were excluded using propidium iodide (PI) staining. Measurements of cell concentration
were performed on a Guava easyCyte (Millipore), gating only viable cells (FSC/SSC/PI−).
Synergy was evaluated using Chou-Talalay Combination Index (CI), calculated with the
CompuSyn program (ComboSyn, Inc.)39. GI50 values for all tested cell lines are provided in
Supplementary Information; JQ1 profiled cell lines.
Competitive proliferation assays using shRNAs in pLMN, pLENC, pLMP or pRT3GENmir30/RT3GEN vectors were performed as described previously1,40. Briefly, for assays
involving Tet-regulated shRNA expression vectors, Tet-on competent MLL-AF9/NrasG12D
mouse AML cells40 or Tet‐on competent derivatives of human leukemia cell lines were
transduced with the respective plasmid at infection rates of <5% to ensure single‐copy
integration. For constitutive shRNA expression (pLMN) cells were analyzed for GFP+
expression 1 day post infection. pRT3GEN transduced cells were selected for 7 days using
G418 (0.5 mg/ml), mixed with 10% uninfected cells, and shRNA expression was induced
through addition of doxycycline (DOX) to a final concentration of 1 μg ml-1. The percentage
of shRNA‐expressing cells (turboGFP+ or GFP+) was measured daily using flow cytometry.

All values were normalized to day 1. Once the percentage of viable cells was below 20%,
measurements were discontinued (indicated in the graph by the discontinuation of the
respective sample). Sequences for all shRNAs used in single assays are provided in

Colony forming assays were performed in Methocult (Stemcell Technologies, Cat. No.
M3231). 1000 AML cells (in 100 µl standard medium) were added to 900 µl Methocult
supplemented with 1 µl of DMSO or JQ1 (to a final concentration of 200 nM). After 7 days
the types of colonies were enumerated and normalised to input.
Gene expression and protein level analysis
RNA was prepared using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). Synthesis of cDNA was
performed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) or Taqman reverse
transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) with random hexamers. Quantitative PCR analysis
was performed on an ABI 7900HT with SYBR green (ABI). All signals were quantified
using the ΔCt method and were normalized to the levels of β-Actin or GAPDH. All primer
used in this study are presented in Supplementary Information; Primer.
For immunoblotting of Suz12, Histone H3K27me3, BRD4, TCF4, IGF2BP1 and MYC, 20
μg of whole-cell lysate (lysis buffer: 50 mM TRIS pH 8, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 5 mM
EDTA) were loaded onto each lane. Protein extracts were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose for blotting.
Preparation of RNA-Seq libraries

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

RNA from human cell lines or mouse AML cells was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini
Kit (Qiagen). mRNA was obtained using two rounds of poly(A) selection using the
Dynabeads mRNA purification kit (Invitrogen) and subsequently fragmented by incubation
at 94°C for 3 min (fragmentation buffer: 40 mM Tris base adjusted to pH 8.2 with glacial
acetic acid, 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM magnesium acetate in DEPC-treated H2O).
Cell lines infected with shRNA expressing vectors were FAC-sorted for shRNA expression
(GFP+) prior to RNA extraction. The fragmented mRNA was used as template for firststrand cDNA synthesis with random hexamers and a NEBNext DNA Library Prep Master
Mix Set for Illumina Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The second-strand cDNA was synthesized
with 100 mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dUTP in the presence of RNase H, E. coli DNA
polymerase I and DNA ligase (Invitrogen). The incorporation of dUTP allowed elimination
of the second strand during library preparation (described below) and thus preservation of
strand specificity.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and ChIP-Seq library construction
ChIP assays were performed exactly as described14 in two to three independent biological
replicates. Crosslinking was performed with sequential EGS and formaldehyde or with
formaldehyde alone. All samples were quantified by quantitative PCR performed using
SYBR green (ABI) on an ABI 7900HT after crosslik reversal. Each immunoprecipitate
signal was referenced to an input standard-curve dilution series (immunoprecipitate/input) to
normalize for differences in starting cell number and for primer amplification efficiency and

normalized to a control region. Two independent biological replicates were performed for
each ChIP-seq experiment.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For ChIP-Seq library construction, 1 x 107 leukemia cells were crosslinked using 1%
formaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature. After purifying immunoprecipitated
DNA using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN), ChIP-Seq libraries were constructed
using the TruSeq ChIP Sample Prep Kit (illumina) following manufacturer’s instructions
with the following exceptions: Following adapter ligation, libraries were amplified for 15
cycles. Briefly, purified ChIP DNA was repaired to blunt ends followed by dA-tailing
process to ligate adapters for multiplex-based sequencing. Size-selection of adapter-ligated
ChIP-DNA was performed with agarose-gel based selection of DNA size ranged from 200 to
350 bp. The final libraries were amplified for 15 cycles, and size-selected with SPRI cleanup by using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Library quality was determined using a
Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Libraries sizes ranged from 250 to 300 bp. ChIP-Seq libraries were
sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Barcoded libraries were sequenced in a
multiplexed fashion with two to six libraries at equal molar ratio, with single-end reads of 50
bases.
Illumina deep sequencing

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

2–5 ng of cDNA or DNA precipitated by ChIP was used as starting material for the
generation of single-end sequencing libraries as described in Illumina’s ChIP Sequencing
sample preparation protocol. DNA fragments of the following sizes were selected for these
experiments: 200–350 bp for ChIP-Seq, 150–700 bp for RNA-Seq. For strand-specific RNASeq, the uridine residues present in one cDNA strand were digested with uracil-Nglycosylase (New England Biolabs), followed by PCR amplification. Completed libraries
were quantified on a Bioanalyzer using the dsDNA 1000 assay kit (Agilent) and the qPCR
NGS library quantification kit (Agilent). Cluster generation and sequencing was performed
using a HiSeq 2000 system with a read length of 50 or 100 nucleotides according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines (Illumina).
Analysis of RNA-seq data
The calculation of RNA expression values was based on the RefSeq database, which was
downloaded from UCSC on January 10th, 2014. Genes with overlapping exons were flagged
and double entries (i.e. exactly the same gene at two different genomic locations) were
renamed. Identical genes with more than one assigned gene symbol were flagged. Genes
with several transcripts were merged to consensus-genes consisting of a union of all
underlying exons using the fuge software (I. Tamir, unpublished), which resulted in 25,098
gene models. Gene names and accession numbers of identical genes are presented in
Supplementary Information; refseq.hg19.2014_0110.imp.map.
Paired-end and single-read fragments were trimmed on their 5’ end (6 cycles PE100, 2
cycles SR50 NEB RNA sample prep protocol), adaptors were removed using cutadapt
v1.4.241 and reads with a length of less than 18 bp in any read of the pair were discarded.
The trimmed and adaptor-free reads were aligned against rDNA of the respective organism
using bowtie2 v2.0.242 for paired-end and bowtie v0.12.543 for single-end reads. The rRNA

cleaned paired-end reads were aligned against the transcriptome to estimate the fragment
size and the standard deviation of the fragment size using bwa v0.6.244. The rRNA cleaned
reads were aligned to the genome with the TopHat splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq
reads45. The uniquely aligning reads were used for counting per gene with htseq-count v
0.6.1p46 with the overlap-resolution mode option set to ‘union’ using the processed RefSeqannotated gene database. Reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) values for
all samples were calculated following Mortazavi A., et al. 200847. Read counts for all
samples were normalized using the median-of-ratios method implemented in DESeq2,
version 1.2.1048. Counts were transformed for PCA using DESeq2’s variance stabilizing
transformation. For both the resistant and sensitive groups, three independent RNA-Seq
experiments on different leukemia cell lines were available. The edgeR R package version
3.4.249 was utilized to calculate the significance of difference in expression of resistant and
sensitive leukemia cell lines (DMSO treated) in Figure 4a. For this, raw counts were
normalized using the “relative log expression” method analogous to DESeq2. Dispersions
were sequentially estimated with the default settings by first estimating a common
dispersion for the gene set and then ‘shrinking’ tagwise dispersion values towards that
dispersion trend. Statistical modeling and analysis was done by fitting a model taking the
separation into sensitive and resistant cell lines into account. Differential expression of genes
between those two groups was subjected to statistical analysis and resulting p-values were
adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction50. The resulting list
was further filtered by only considering genes which all have higher normalized counts in
the sensitive cell lines vs the resistant cell lines or vice versa.
GSEA analysis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Gene set enrichment analysis20 was performed using GSEA v2.07 software with 1,000 gene
set permutations. KEGG signaling gene sets and Wnt signaling associated gene sets were
obtained from the Molecular Signatures Database v4.0 (MSigDB, http://
www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). To perform GSEA with human gene
signatures, human-mouse homologs from the mouse gene sets were identified and converted
into human gene names using the NCBI homologene database (build68). Ambiguous
homolog mapping i.e. different mouse gene names pointing to the same human homolog
was excluded. A detailed description of GSEA methodology and interpretation is provided
at http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html. In brief, the
normalized enrichment score (NES) provides ‘the degree to which a gene set is
overrepresented at the top or bottom of a ranked list of genes’. The nominal p value (Nom pval) describes ‘the statistical significance of the enrichment score’. The false discovery rate
q-value (FDR q-val) is ‘the estimated probability that a gene set with a given NES represents
a false positive finding’. ‘In general, given the lack of coherence in most expression datasets
and the relatively small number of gene sets being analyzed, an FDR cutoff of 25% is
appropriate.’ All gene sets used in this study are provided in Supplementary Information;
GSEA gene sets.
ChIP-Seq data analysis
Adaptors of the single-read fragments were removed using cutadapt v1.4.241 and reads with
a length of less than 18bp in any read of the pair were discarded. The remaining reads were

aligned to the genome (mouse: mm10, human: hg19) using Bowtie v1.0.043. Reads with
same start and end position on the same strand were removed from the alignment. To
identify ChIP-Seq peaks, we used the MACS2 v2.1.0.20141030 (https://github.com/taoliu/
MACS/) peak finding algorithm. A 3-fold enrichment relative to input control samples was
used for peak calling as well as the option to call broad peaks. Building a shifting model was
disabled and the small nearby and large nearby region parameters were set to 5,000 and
20,000 respectively. The extension size was set to the respective median insert size of the
ChIP-Seq treatment sample for paired-end data and the estimated fragment size for singleend data. Read numbers for the resulting peaks were quantified using the BEDTools suite51
and normalized to total mapped reads. The Brd4 ChIP-Seq track was obtained from
published data sets19 (GEO sample GSM1262345). Peaks were assigned to modified
versions of the RefSeq database (GRCh37/hg19 downloaded on January 10, 2014 from
UCSC Table Browser and GRCm38/mm10 downloaded on June 30, 2014 from UCSC Table
Browser) by assigning peaks to the closest upstream/downstream TSS using BEDTools. For
these versions, overlapping genes were flagged and double entries (i.e. exactly the same
gene at two different genomic locations) were renamed. Identical genes with more than one
assigned gene symbol were flagged. For the density heatmaps, ChIP-Seq peaks were
identified using the MACS version 1.4.0beta (Model based Analysis of ChIP-Seq)52 peak
finding algorithm. A p value threshold of enrichment of 1 x 10-5, a false discovery rate
(FDR) of less than 1%, and a 5-fold enrichment relative to input control samples were used
for all peak calling. The Brd4 peaks were considered as promoter if the peak showed at least
1bp overlap within +/- 200bp of RefSeq gene TSSs. If Brd4-called peaks showed no overlap
within +/- 200bp of RefSeq gene TSSs, they were considered as enhancer-bound peaks.
Heatmap matrices were created by counting tags using 10kb window (+/- 5kb of the peak
summit) and 20bp bin size. Further visualization of heatmap matrices were done using Java
TreeView 1.1.6r4 (http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net). For comparing DMSO and JQ1 treated
ChIP-Seq datasets, heatmap matrices were normalized to total mapped reads counts before
visualization with Java TreeView.
STARR-seq screens
STARR-seq screens were done as described previously24, with the following exceptions.
DNA from 21 bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), which were available for the
extended MYC locus covering approximately 91% of the surrounding 3Mb of genomic
region, plus 25 genic control BACs, were used for library generation. The fragmented BAC
DNA was cloned into the human STARR-seq screening vector24 containing a minimal
MYC promoter. We transfected 500µg of this library into 1×108 K-562 cells per condition,
using a BTX Agile Pulse MAX system (Harvard Apparatus) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Electroporation conditions: two pulses at 750V for 0.5 ms (100 ms interval),
followed by 5 pulses of 250V for 2 ms (100 ms interval) in BTXpress cytoporation medium
T. After electroporation, the cells were grown at 37°C in RPMI-1640 containing either
DMSO or 250nM JQ1 and were harvested after 24h. For each screen we isolated poly-A
RNA and processed it as described before24, with a different extension time of 45s in the
final amplification of the cDNA and modified primers for the first cDNA amplification. All
BACs used for the STARR-seq screen are provided in Supplementary Information; STARRseq BACs.

STARR-seq deep sequencing and analysis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

All sequencing was performed as a 50-cycle paired-end run on an Illumina HiSeq2000
machine. STARR-seq and input read processing was performed as described24, with the
following exceptions. Libraries from different conditions were normalized to each other by
subsampling to 105 reads per condition using reservoir sampling. Peaks were called using
macs2 (v 2.1.0)52 with the input library as background. The peaks were then filtered for a
minimal fold enrichment of 3 and only peaks with at least 5 reads per kb were considered for
further analysis. Peak calling was performed for STARR-seq reads from both conditions
(DMSO and JQ1) and the resulting peaks were merged using bedtools merge51. STARR-seq
enrichment was calculated using bedtools coverage51. Differential fold enrichment was
calculated as the ratio between enrichments in JQ1 over DMSO and expressed in log2.
Luciferase assays and data analysis
Luciferase assays were done as described previously24, with the following exceptions.
Enhancer candidate regions were amplified from genomic DNA and shuttled into a modified
pGL4 luciferase reporter vector containing a minimal MYC promoter
(chr8:128,748,440-128,748,550). Each construct was tested by co-transfecting 106 K-562
cells with 45µg of the firefly luciferase construct and 5µg of a renilla luciferase control
plasmid (pGL4.75, Promega). After electroporation, the cells were grown at 37°C in
RPMI-1640 containing either DMSO or 250nM JQ1 and were harvested after 46h. Relative
luciferase signals (firefly/renilla) were normalized to signal from two negative background
sequences chosen based on their absence of STARR-seq signal and expressed as fold change
over background. We analyzed the statistical significance of differential luciferase signals
with or without JQ1 treatment using an unpaired t test with Welch’s correction for three
biological replicates. Primer sequences which were used to amplify the particular enhancer
regions are deposited in Supplementary Information; Primer.

Animal experiments
Mouse MLL-AF9/NrasG12D leukemia cells (RN2) were transplanted by tail-vein injection of
1 × 105 cells into sub-lethally (5.5 Gy) irradiated female B6/SJL (CD45.1) recipient mice at
the age of 6-10 weeks (n=5, for each individual experiment). For whole-body
bioluminescent imaging, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 50 mg kg−1 D-Luciferin
(Goldbio), and after 5 min analyzed using an IVIS Spectrum system (Caliper LifeSciences).
For JQ1 treatment trials, a stock of 100 mg ml−1 JQ1 in DMSO was 20-fold diluted by drop
wise addition of a 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin carrier (Sigma) under vortexing,
yielding a 5 mg ml−1 final solution. Mice were intraperitoneally injected daily with freshly
diluted JQ1 (50 mg kg−1) or a similar volume of carrier containing 5% DMSO. JQ1
treatment was started 3 days after transplantation of RN2 cells stably transduced with pLMN
shRen.713 and shSuz12.1676. Mice transplanted with RN2 cells expressing beta-catenin
cDNA or empty vector were treated with JQ1 daily starting 1 day after transplantation. All
animals were maintained in the pathogen-free animal facility of the Research Institute of
Molecular Pathology, and all procedures were carried out according to an ethical animal
license, which is approved and regularly controlled by the Austrian Veterinary Authorities.

Ten patients with AML (females, n=4; males, n=6) and two with CML blast phase (BP)
(males, n=2) were examined. Diagnoses were established according to the proposal of the
French-American-British (FAB) cooperative study group53,54 and the classification of the
World Health Organization (WHO)55. Informed consent was obtained prior to BM puncture
in each case. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (Ethics Committee)
of the Medical University of Vienna. Mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated using Ficoll
and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. After thawing the viability of cells ranged from 75%
to 85% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion.RNA was isolated from BM or peripheral blood
MNC using the RNeasy MinElute CleanupKit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized using RQ1
DNase buffer, RQ1 DNase and RQ1 DNase Stop Solution (Promega), Moloney murine

MNC were cultured in 96-well plates (TPP) in RPMI-1640 medium (Lonza) with 10% fetal
calf serum in the absence or presence of JQ1 (50–5,000 nM) at 37°C for 48 hours. AML
MNC were incubated with JQ1 in the presence of 100 ng/ml recombinant human (rh) GCSF (Amgen), 100 ng/ml rhSCF (Peprotech) and 100 ng/ml rhIL-3 (Novartis Pharma AG).
CML BP cells were incubated with JQ1 without cytokines. After incubation, 0.5 µCi 3Hthymidine (Perkin Elmer) was added for 16 hours. Cells were then harvested on filter
membranes in a Filtermate 196 harvester (Packard Bioscience). Filters were air-dried and the
bound radioactivity was measured in a Top-Count NXT β-counter (Packard Bioscience). All
experiments were performed in triplicates. Proliferation was calculated as percent of
medium control, and the inhibitory effects of JQ1 were expressed as IC50 values.
Statistical analyses
Results are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). If not stated otherwise
statistical significance was calculated by two-tailed unpaired t-test on two experimental
conditions with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Statistical significance level was
set as follows: ****, p<0.0001 ***, p<0.001, **, p<0.01, *, p<0.05. No statistical methods
were used to predetermine sample size.

context, while neither baseline nor dynamic expression analysis can accurately distinguish
sensitive and resistant contexts. d, MYC mRNA levels (RPKM) at different time points after
JQ1 treatment (200 nM) in indicated cell lines, relative to levels in DMSO-treated cells.
Individual cell line pairs are grouped for their tissue context and colored according to their
sensitivities (green, sensitive; red, resistant). e, Number of genes 2-fold up- or

proliferation assays in MOLM-13 cells functionally evaluating the potency of BRD2, BRD3
and BRD4 shRNAs over time using a Tet‐regulated vector (pRT3GEN) in presence of
doxycycline. Only shRNAs targeting BRD4 induce a proliferative disadvantage and lead to
rapid depletion of GFP+ cells over time. Red labels indicate most potent shRNAs based on
results obtained from reporter and competitive proliferation assay. c, Determination of
BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 mRNA levels in K-562 and MOLM-13 cells expressing the

treatment with 200 nM JQ1 for 24h. JQ1-induced expression changes show the largest
overlap with cells expressing a validated BRD4 shRNA, suggesting that suppression of
BRD4 is the key effector mechanism of JQ1 in leukemia. e, Venn diagrams showing the
overlap of genes commonly up- or down-regulated following 2h and 24h of JQ1 either in all
contexts, or specifically in sensitive or resistant leukemias. f, HEXIM1/Hexim1 expression

activate its own transcription from a minimal MYC promoter. mRNA corresponding to
active enhancer elements will therefore become more abundant among the cellular RNA
compared to inactive fragments. b, PVT1 mRNA levels (RPKM) at different time points
after JQ1 treatment (200 nM) in indicated cell lines, relative to levels in DMSO-treated cells.
PVT1 expression is generally reduced upon JQ1 treatment indicating no association with

using the CompuSyn software and percent inhibition (fraction affected, Fa) resulting from
combined action of the two drugs versus effects of either drug alone. CI values <1.0 indicate
synergism of the two agents. e, As in (d) cell viability was determined for human ASPC-1
pancreatic cancer cells following 5 days of treatment with Pyrvinium and/or JQ1 as

Figure 2. BET resistant AML cells restore the transcription of key Brd4 target genes through
remodeling of regulatory landscapes and pathways.

a, Heat map showing RPKM fold-change (FC) of 235 response genes in MLL/
AF9;NrasG12D leukemia cells expressing the indicated shRNAs after treatment with DMSO
or JQ1 (200 nM) for 2h or 24h, and after long-term (LT) JQ1 treatment (50 nM) for 6 weeks.
Response genes were defined based on JQ1-induced changes in Ren.713 expressing
leukemia cells (FC>2/<0.5 after 2h and FC>2/<0.33 after 24h). Samples are presented
according to non-hierarchical clustering; genes are grouped in up- or down-regulated targets

regions in sensitive AML cells (wt and Ren.713) and Suz12.1842-expressing resistant AML
cells under long-term (LT) treatment with JQ1 (50 nM). The H3K27ac profile in Ren.713
control AML cells is shown on top for the entire region (~2 MB), together with validated
transcript models from the mm10 genome assembly. Additional tracks are zoomed in on the
proximal region and a distal region containing an established cluster of enhancers (E1E5)19, as indicated (dotted lines). The y-axis reflects the number of normalized cumulative
tag counts in each region. e, Schematic of RNA-seq profiling in resistant AML cells
generated through expression of three independent shRNAs targeting Suz12 or Ezh2, which
are treated as biological triplicates and compared to triplicate control cells. f, Gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) of expression changes in 22 KEGG signaling pathways in
resistant AML cells generated as described in (e). Plotted are normalized enrichment scores
(NES) against nominal p-values; significantly altered gene sets (p<0.05) are indicated in the
graph.
