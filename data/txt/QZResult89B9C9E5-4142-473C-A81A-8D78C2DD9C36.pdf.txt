ABSTRACT
HNF1β is expressed exclusively in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) and not in
other ovarian cancers, regarded as a hallmark of this tumor. This implies its central
role in the unique character of OCCC, including resistance to chemotherapy, but its
exact role and influence in cancer biology or the molecular bases of its function
are largely unknown. Using comprehensive metabolome analysis of HNF1β_shRNAstable cell lines, we show here that HNF1β drastically alters intracellular metabolism,
especially in direction to enhance aerobic glycolysis, so called the “Warburg effect”.
The consequence of the metabolic change contributed cell survival under stresses such
as hypoxia and chemo-reagent, only when sufficient glucose supply was available.
Augmented cell survival was based on the reduced ROS activity derived from metabolic
alteration such as shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and increased
intracellular anti-oxidant, glutathione (GSH). One of the cystine transporters, rBAT
is likely to play a major role in this GSH increase. These data suggest that HNF1β,
possibly induced by stressful microenvironment in the endometriotic cyst, confers
survival advantage to the epithelial cells, which leads to the occurrence of OCCC,
a chemo-resistant phenotype of ovarian cancer.

free iron and consequently reactive oxygen species
(ROS), is extraordinarily stressful to epithelial cells
within the cyst [11]. ROS are one of the major causes of
cancer development, and at the same time, cancer cells
must cope with various external and internal ROS for
survival [12]. In addition to external ROS, an increased
requirement for energy accompanied by proliferative
tumor growth produces high levels of internal ROS
through the mitochondrial respiratory chain [13, 14]. To
avoid cell damage from these external and internal ROS,
cells possess scavenger systems to eliminate ROS and
minimize damage [15–18]. Indeed, the choice between
cell survival and death depends on the balance between
ROS production and potential for elimination.
We have also shown that OCCC has a unique
gene expression profile consisting of many stress-related
genes. Specifically, we suggested that the transcription

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a relatively
rare subtype among the ovarian cancers, but is a clinically
important entity because it is generally resistant to
chemotherapy and is known to have a worse prognosis
compared with other ovarian cancers [1–4]. Another
clinical feature of OCCC is its frequent occurrence in
endometriotic cysts, so called “chocolate cysts”. Studies
have indicated that approximately 1% of endometriotic
cysts give rise to ovarian cancer [5–9], and, unlike
common ovarian cancers, which are most frequently
serous carcinomas, cancers occurring from endometriotic
cysts are primarily clear cell and endometrioid carcinomas
[8–10]. However, the reason for this remains unclear.
We have shown previously that the microenvironment
within the “chocolate cyst,” which contains high levels of

factor HNF1β (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 homeobox B),
a gene specifically expressed in OCCC, distinguishes
this phenotype from other ovarian cancers [19, 20].
HNF1β is a transcription factor which shares strong
homology with HNF1α. Functionally, it is associated with
developmental process of liver, pancreas and kidney.
Clinically, heterozygous germline mutations in HNF1β
is responsible for a familial forms of type 2 diabetes
designated as maturity-onset diabetes of the young,
subtype 5 (MODY5), which is often associated with
congenital abnormalities such as polycystic kidney,
pancreatic hypoplasia and genital tract abnormality [21].
In addition, overexpression of HNF1β has been
reported in multiple malignancies including OCCC.
So far, reported function of HNF1β includes epithelial
morphogenesis and differentiation [22], regulation of urate
transporter and organic anion transporters [23]. Kornfeld
et. al. showed that HNF1β knockdown in mouse liver cells
caused gluconeogenesis [24], suggesting that HNF1β has
strong relation with glucose metabolism. However, precise
mechanism how HNF1β contributes cancer biology
remains to be elucidated.
We have previously demonstrated that HNF1β
activates glycolysis and increases lactate production
in OCCC cell line, RMG2 [25]. Regarding the unique
glucose metabolism in cancer, Otto Warburg reported in
1956 that cancer cells prefer to metabolize glucose by
glycolysis even in the presence of adequate oxygen [26].
This seemingly paradoxical phenomenon is called the
Warburg effect and is now known as a metabolic hallmark
of cancer cells, but its causal relationship with cancer
progression remains largely unknown [12, 27–29]. One
compelling explanation of the Warburg effect is that cancer
cells gain survival advantage, such as ROS resistance and
consequent apoptosis inhibition [12, 16, 27, 28], supply
of biosynthetic substrates [12, 15, 16, 28], and oxygenindependent energy production [12, 15, 16, 28].
In this study, we hypothesized that HNF1β, which is
expressed exclusively in OCCC confer anti-ROS activity
by altering glucose metabolism, thereby contributing to
carcinogenesis in high ROS environment of endometriotic
cysts and cell survival in OCCC. We attempted to explore
the full extent of the metabolic alterations caused by
HNF1β in OCCC using a comprehensive metabolic assay.
Additionally, we investigated the biological influences of
these alterations.

64 ovarian cancer clinical samples from Kyoto University
Hospital, and GSE6008, which contain 99 ovarian cancer
clinical samples [30]. The samples in each dataset were
divided into the OCCC group and the non-OCCC group,
and gene sets enriched in the OCCC group were extracted
and analyzed.
In GSE39204, 46 gene sets enriched in the OCCC
group contained 15 metabolic activity-related gene
sets. In GSE6008, 72 gene sets enriched in the OCCC
group contained 13 metabolic activity-related gene sets.
Among the 24 gene sets enriched both in GSE39204 and
GSE6008, 9 metabolic activity-related gene sets were
present. The ratio of metabolic activity-related gene sets
in these groups was significantly higher than the ratio in
the total gene sets (Msig DB C5_all v4.0) (GSE39204:
p < 0.0001, GSE6008: p = 0.0223, both: p < 0.0001)
(Fig. 1, detailed data are shown in Table S1a and S1b).
In addition, GSEA revealed that 2 transcription
motifs of HNF1 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1) and SF1
(splicing factor 1) were enriched in the OCCC group in
both GSE39204 and GSE6008 (Msig DB C3.tft.v4.0)
(Table S1c), which suggested that these transcription
factors may be associated with the unique metabolic
features of OCCC (Fig. 1).

HNF1β drastically changed intracellular glucose
metabolites
To explore the influence of HNF1β on metabolic
activity in OCCC, we performed comprehensive
in vitro analysis of intracellular metabolism in HNF1β
knockdown RMG2 cells (HNF1β_sh1) and control cells
(control) that were established as described [25]. A total
of 193 peaks were identified as candidate metabolites by
this assay, of which 88 metabolites were significantly
altered in HNF1β_sh1 cells. Of these, 52 metabolites
were decreased by at least 0.7-fold and 20 were increased
by at least 1.4-fold (Table S2a & S2b). Specifically,
lactic acid, the final product of anaerobic glycolysis,
was significantly decreased in HNF1β_sh1 cells. In
contrast, citric acid, the first metabolite of the TCA
cycle following integration of acetyl CoA into this cycle
from the glycolytic process, was significantly increased
in HNF1β_sh1 cells (p < 0.05 for both), and malic acid
that was to be converted to citric acid if pyruvic acid was
provided to the TCA cycle via acetyl CoA, was decreased,
suggesting that oxidative phosphorylation is more active
in these cells (or less active in HNF1β-high cells by
acetyl CoA supply stagnation) (Fig. 2a). Regarding as
lactic acid decrease in HNF1β_sh1 cells, there are other
mechanisms that could control the lactic acid level
such as lactic acid transporters and another lactic acid
synthesis pathway. However, in microarray analysis, the
expression of SLC16A1 that encodes lactic acid import
transporter MCT1 was high, and that of SLC16A3 that
encodes lactic acid export transporter MCT4 was low in

were enriched in both GSE39204 and GSE6008, in which 9 were metabolic activity-related. In addition, 2 transcription motifs of HNF1

HNF1β_sh1 cells and in non-clear cell samples (Fig. S1),
suggesting that lactic acid transporters expressed not to
decrease lactic acid, but to compensate it. With respect
to the pathway for lactic acid synthesis from pyruvate
via glucose-alanine cycle, in spite of low level of lactic
acid, both the alanine and pyruvate showed high level in
HNF1β_sh1 cells in the metabolome analysis (Fig. S2).
These results collectively suggested that lactic acid
accumulation in HNF1β-high control cells is derived from
increased glycolysis, but not from other mechanisms.
Conclusively, it is suggested that HNF1β causes a
metabolic shift from the TCA cycle to glycolysis. In
contrast, regarding the pentose-phosphate-pathway (PPP),
which is generally activated by aerobic glycolysis and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

thought to supply lipid and nucleotide substrates, neither
6 phosphogluconic acid (6 PG), the first metabolite of
PPP, nor NADPH, the key substrate of lipid synthesis,
were significantly changed (Fig. 2a). As for nucleotide
synthesis, uric acid, the last product of nucleotide
metabolism, increased significantly in HNF1β_sh1
cells (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2a), which might be the result
of significant G6PD increase. These data indicated
that HNF1β does not activate PPP even during aerobic
glycolysis. Likewise, regarding as the energy supply that
is thought to be supported by aerobic glycolysis under
certain conditions, neither ATP nor energy charge levels
((ATP+1/2ADP) / (ATP+ADP+AMP)) were significantly
changed (Fig. 2b).

HNF1β reduced intracellular ROS and
contributed to oxidative stress resistance

We also assessed the expression levels of the
HK1, G6PD, and LDHA genes, which are assumed to
be related to aerobic glycolysis. In HNF1β_sh1 cells,
the expression of HK1 and LDHA was significantly
decreased (p < 0.0001), but the expression of G6PD
was significantly increased (p < 0.0001) (Fig. S3a).
In addition, based on analysis of the clinical dataset
GSE39204, HK1 and LDHA were significantly higher
in the OCCC group than in the non-OCCC group, and
they were significantly correlated with the expression of
HNF1β (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference
in the expression of G6PD between the two groups
(Fig. S3b).

The oxygen independent nature of aerobic
glycolysis also provides an advantage by decreasing
oxidative phosphorylation in the TCA cycle, which is the
main source of intracellular ROS.
To explore whether HNF1β expression is associated
with ROS regulation and consequent resistance to
oxidative stress, we performed HNF1β redox functional
assays. HNF1β knockdown significantly increased
intracellular ROS activity levels in both RMG2 and
JHOC5 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5a & 5d). Moreover, when
these cells were cultured in conditions with extracellular
oxidative stress such as medium containing ferric
nitrilotriacetate (FeNTA), an iron chelate, or H2O2, a
well-known extra/intracellular oxidative agent, increase
in intracellular ROS activity was significantly more
prominent in HNF1β knockdown cells (p < 0.005)
(Fig. 5a – 5e). This consequently decreased the IC50 of
FeNTA in HNF1β knockdown cells (Fig. 5f).

HNF1β expression allowed OCCC cells to
survive in hypoxic conditions
We performed functional assays using 2 types of
HNF1β knockdown lines (HNF1β_sh1, sh2) of both
RMG2 and JHOC5 OCCC cells (Fig. S4a & S4b). To
explore whether HNF1β expression is associated with
cell adaptation to hypoxia, we performed WST assays
in both 2% and 20% O2. In RMG2 cell lines, the number
of live HNF1β knockdown cells significantly decreased
in 2% O2 compared to those in 20% O2. In contrast, in
both RMG2 and JHOC5 cell lines, HNF1β-high control
cells showed increased number of live cells in 2% O2
(Fig. 3a & 3b). We further assessed the chemo-resistance
of RMG2 and JHOC5 cells under hypoxic conditions.
Cell survival, which was assessed by the ratio of the
number of cells alive after 24 hours exposure to 20,
40, or 80 μM CDDP to the number of cells alive after
24 hours without CDDP, was significantly decreased
in HNF1β knockdown cells (p < 0.01 for both cell
types) (Fig. 3c & 3d). Furthermore, JHOC5 cells,
under  hypoxic  condition, showed significantly low
IC50 of CDDP in HNF1β knockdown cells (p < 0.02)
(Fig. 3e).

HNF1β expression was associated with
intracellular GSH levels
To elucidate ROS regulation by HNF1β, we further
evaluated the metabolism of intracellular glutathione
(GSH), a primary intracellular redox regulator.
Metabolome analysis in RMG2 cells showed that
intracellular GSH significantly decreased in HNF1β_sh1
cells (p < 0.0005) (Fig. 6a). In GSH substrates, cysteine,
which is the rate-limiting metabolite of GSH synthesis,
decreased, glutamate was not altered, and glycine
significantly increased in HNF1β_sh1 cells (HNF1β_
sh1 /control: 0.60 (p = 0.158), 097 (p = 0.470), 1.21
(p  <  0.001), respectively) (Fig. 6a). We confirmed the
results of the metabolome analysis by another method in
RMG2 and JHOC5. Using an enzyme recycling method,
we assessed total intracellular GSH and the ratio of
GSSG (the oxidized form of GSH) to total GSH. HNF1β
knockdown significantly decreased intracellular GSH and
increased the ratio of GSSG to total GSH (Fig. 6b & 6c).
These results indicate that HNF1β increases intracellular
GSH and, thus, enhances the redox potential of OCCC
cells.
Next, we investigated the mechanism by which
HNF1β increased intracellular GSH levels. Messenger
RNA expression levels of GSH synthesis-related
synthases, including glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory
subunit (GCLM), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic
subunit (GCLC), and glutathione synthase (GS), as well
as GSH transporters of the substrates glutamate, glycine,
and cysteine, were analyzed by microarray. Among the
synthase-coding genes, only GCLC expression was
significantly decreased in the RMG2 HNF1β_sh1 cells

HNF1β-induced cell survival was abrogated
under glucose deprivation
Control, HNF1β_sh1, and HNF1β_sh2 RMG2
cells were cultured in normal growth medium (glucose
(+) medium) and in glucose-deprivation medium
(glucose (−) medium) in normoxic condition, and cell
numbers were measured every 24 hours by WST-8 assay.
In glucose (+) medium, HNF1β_sh1, and HNF1β_sh2
RMG2 cells had similar number compared with control
cells (Fig. 4a). By contrast, in glucose (−) medium,
the number of live cells were significantly less in
control RMG2 which had high HNF1β expression
(Fig. 4b, 4c, & 4d), suggesting that HNF1β-induced
cell survival effect is highly dependent on the glucose
supply.

Most intracellular cysteine is taken into cells in its
oxidized form, cystine. Therefore, we investigated whether
the cystine supply altered intracellular GSH. Indeed,
decreasing the cystine supply by altering the cystine
concentration in the growth medium reduced intracellular
GSH (Fig. 7a).
The cystine supply is generally regulated by cystine
transporters in live cells. One of these transporters,
rBAT (related to b0,+ amino acid transporter), was
significantly decreased by HNF1β knockdown (p < 0.001)
(Fig.  6f  &  7b). Expression of rBAT protein was also
decreased by HNF1β knockdown in both RMG2 and
JHOC5 cells (Fig. 7c).
Based on these findings, we further investigated
whether induction of rBAT by HNF1β led to GSH synthesis,
using 2 types of rBAT knockdown lines (rBAT_sh1, sh2) of
both RMG2 and JHOC5 OCCC cells (Fig. S4c & S4d).
rBAT knockdown significantly reduced intracellular GSH

(p < 0.05) (Fig. 6d), whereas it was not significantly
associated with HNF1β expression in the clinical dataset
GSE39204 (Fig. 6e). Moreover, none of the synthases
displayed significantly higher expression in the OCCC
group (Fig. 6e). In contrast, among the GSH substraterelated transporter-coding genes, rBAT / SLC3A1, which
encoded a subunit of the b0,+ amino acid transporter, was
significantly decreased by HNF1β knockdown (p < 0.001)
(Fig. 6f). Furthermore, rBAT was significantly higher in
the OCCC group and was also significantly correlated with
HNF1β expression (p < 0.001) (Fig. 6g).

HNF1β induced rBAT expression increased
intracellular GSH in OCCC
In GSH synthesis, cysteine is known to be the ratelimiting substance because the total levels of cysteine are
much lower in cells than the levels of other molecules.

oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, which is called
the Warburg effect [27–29]. Although the Warburg effect
is a universally observed phenomenon in various types of
cancer cells [31–33], its causal relationship with cancer
biology remains unclear. We have previously shown that
HNF1β, a molecule that is expressed in high frequency
and specificity in OCCC, facilitates glucose uptake and
promotes concomitant glycolysis, leading to increased
lactic acid production [25]. In this study, we started by
confirming our previous observation [19, 20, 34] that
OCCC has a characteristic gene expression profile that
specifically includes enriched metabolism-related genes.
Indeed, HNF1 transcription motif and metabolism-related

DISCUSSION
It is well known that cancer cells have unusual
metabolic patterns relative to normal cells. A common
example of this is the intracellular metabolic shift from

gene sets were enriched in OCCC based on GSEA analysis
using ovarian cancer data sets GSE39204 and GSE6008
(Fig. 1 & Table S1a – S1c). These data led us to investigate
the broader spectrum of metabolic activity associated with
HNF1β, using a comprehensive metabolite analysis. In
addition, we attempted to elucidate the mechanism and
biological consequence of the unique metabolism caused
by HNF1β.
Comprehensive intracellular metabolites analysis
revealed that HNF1β dynamically altered intracellular
metabolism. First, we focused on glucose metabolism.
As we have previously reported [25], lactic acid, the
final product of anaerobic glycolysis, was significantly
decreased in HNF1β knockdown cells (Fig. 2a).
Supportively we confirmed that this lactic acid decrease
was not caused by altered lactic acid transport, or
another synthetic pathway. Although facilitated lactic
acid accumulation by lactic acid transporter MCTs
(Monocarboxylate Transporters) was reported in some
cancers [35, 36], the expression of lactic acid import
transporter MCT1 was low, and the lactic acid export
transporter MCT4 was high in HNF1β-high cells (Fig. S1).
Alanine or pyruvate, intermediates of another lactic acid
synthesis pathway, also did not increase in metabolome
assay in HNF1β-high cells (Fig. S2 & 2a). These results
indicated that HNF1β, by glycolysis, increased lactic
acid production and accumulation, which consequently
caused upregulation of lactic acid export. At the same
time, citric acid, the first metabolite of the TCA cycle
following integration of acetyl CoA into this cycle
from the glycolytic process, was significantly increased
(Fig. 2a). The process converting malic acid to citric acid
is impaired, leading to malic acid accumulation in HNF1βhigh OCCC cells (Fig. 2a). These results suggest that
HNF1β overexpression in OCCC leads to the metabolic
shift from oxidative phosphorylation in the TCA cycle to
glycolysis even in aerobic condition, namely, the Warburg
effect.
In addition to the results of metabolome analysis,
microarray data also indicated that key genes of the
Warburg effect, such as HK1(Hexokinase-1) that
supports glucose supply through phosphating glucose to
glucose-6-phosphate, and LDHA that supports conversion
pyruvate to lactic acid, [11, 37–39] were significantly
higher in HNF1β-high OCCC cells (Fig. S3a). In the
analysis of the clinical dataset GSE39204, HK1 and LDHA
were also expressed at higher levels in the OCCC group
than in the non-OCCC group. Expression levels of these
genes were correlated significantly to the expression of
HNF1β (p < 0.0001) (Fig. S3b). Collectively, these results
suggest that HNF1β contributes to enhance the Warburg
effect. There are reports indicating that activation of
specific genes, especially oncogenes such as Ras or Akt,
causes similar metabolic shift [28], suggesting that genetic
events associated with cancer development occasionally
accompany metabolic alteration.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Several advantages of the Warburg effect have
been proposed in cancer cells [12, 16, 26–28], one of
which is energy support. Although anaerobic glycolysis
is inefficient in energy production, it enables cells to
acquire needed energy more rapidly than with oxidative
phosphorylation in TCA cycle, both in aerobic and
anaerobic conditions as long as abundant glucose is
provided [12, 16]. Since a majority of the cancer cells
grow rapidly than normal cells, they usually require
excessive energy support. However, in this study, we
found no evidence that HNF1β increased intracellular
energy supplies at least under normoxic conditions
(Fig. 2b). A second possible advantage of the Warburg
effect is the supply of substrates, especially lipids and
nucleotides, which are required for cellular proliferation. It
is proposed that the Warburg effect activates the pentosephosphate-pathway which increases the supply of these
substrates [12, 16, 28]. However, HNF1β did not seem
to activate this pathway. Neither the levels of 6 PG, the
first metabolite of PPP nor NADPH, the key substrate
of lipid synthesis, were significantly changed (Fig. 2a).
Clinically, OCCC is known as a relatively slow-growing
tumor, which suggests that OCCC particularly does not
necessarily need to utilize these benefits of the Warburg
effect. These data are consistent with our previous report
that HNF1β, unlike oncogenes, decreases cell proliferation
of OCCC in normal oxygen condition [25]. The third
advantage of the Warburg effect is to support cell survival
with unstable oxygen supply in cancer microenvironments
[12, 16, 27, 28]. In this study, HNF1β-high OCCC cells
had a survival advantage especially under hypoxic
conditions (Fig. 3a & 3b). Furthermore, these cells were
also more resistant to CDDP treatment not in nomoxic
condition but in hypoxic conditions compared with
HNF1β knockdown cells (Fig. S5a, S5b, & 3c–3e). It is
notable that cell survival advantage was exerted only
under abundant glucose supply. Generally, glucose
dependency is thought to be one of the weak points of the
Warburg effect. Other groups have reported that glucose
deprivation is critical in cancers displaying the Warburg
effect [37, 47, 48]. On the other hands, it has been also
reported that some cancers compensate ineffective energy
production of glycolysis by energy production using
glutamine via glutaminolysis [49, 50]. In our metabolome
assay, however, HNF1β increased neither glutamate nor
α-ketoglutarate (2-OG) in the pathway of glutaminolysis
(Fig. 2a), suggesting that HNF1β does not facilitate
glytaminolysis. As expected, survival benefit of HNF1βhigh OCCC cells was significantly impaired in glucose
deprivation, suggesting that cell survival of HNF1β-high
OCCC cells is highly dependent on glucose uptake and
consumption (Fig. 4a - 4d).
Higher ROS activity readily leads to initiation
of apoptosis. Cell survival advantage by the Warburg
effect had been mostly ascribed to the detoxication of
intracellular ROS. Oxidative phosphorylation in the TCA
26012

Oncotarget

cycle is the primary source of intracellular ROS, and the
Warburg effect represses it by increasing the oxygenindependent glycolysis [14, 17, 40, 41]. Therefore, we
measured intracellular ROS activity in OCCC cells with
high and low HNF1β expression. Our results indicated
that, in normal medium, HNF1β-high OCCC cells
had lower levels of intracellular ROS (Fig. 5a & 5d),
suggesting that HNF1β expression is likely to reduce
intracellular ROS activity and thereby confers ROS
resistance in OCCC cells. Because OCCC is exposed to
free iron-induced external ROS in endometriotic cysts,
as we reported previously [11], we also examined the
effect of HNF1β expression under known extracellular
oxidative stressors such as ferric nitrilotriacetate (FeNTA)
or H2O2. Again, under such oxidative stress, control
OCCC cells with high HNF1β expression had lower ROS
activity levels compared with their HNF1β knockdown
counterparts (Fig. 5a – 5e). These data suggest that,
HNF1β expression reduces intracellular ROS activity and
thereby confers ROS resistance in OCCC cells, maybe by
the direct consequence of the Warburg effect.
In addition to the suppression of oxidative
phosphorylation, our metabolome analysis also showed
that HNF1β knockdown is associated with a significant
decrease in intracellular GSH, a major regulator of
intracellular ROS (Fig. 6a - 6c) [41–43]. In addition,
the ratio of GSSG, an oxidized form of GSH, was also
high in HNF1β knockdown cells (Fig. 6b & 6c). This
suggests that active intracellular GSH is more abundant
in HNF1β-high OCCC cells, which may also contribute
to the ROS resistance of these cells. To explore the
mechanism of the higher GSH levels in HNF1β-high
OCCC cells, we measured GSS, GCLC and GCLM, the
enzymes that produce GSH, but found no significant
difference between HNF1β-high and low OCCC cells
(Fig. 6d & 6e). Recently, several reports have shown that
chemo-resistant tumor cells, including cancer stem cells,
increase intracellular GSH through the cystine transporter
xCT [17, 18, 44, 45]. In our experiment, cystine levels
were associated with the amount of GSH in OCCC cells
(Fig. 7a). However, we found no upregulation of xCT
expression in HNF1β-high OCCC cells. Instead, we found
that another cystine transporter, rBAT (Related to b0,+
Amino acid Transporter), was expressed at significantly
higher levels in these cells (Fig. 6f). rBAT is coded by
rBAT / SLC3A1 which is well known as the responsible
gene of type I cystinuria. Heterodimer of rBAT and
BAT1 (b0,+AT), which is coded by SLC7A9, transports
cystine and dibasic amino acids, such as lysine, arginine,
and ornithine, and thus is critical for reabsorption of these
amino acids in the proximal tubule. With regard to the
relation of HNF1β and rBAT, Sauert K. et al. reported that
HNF1β mutation decreased rBAT expression [46]. And
the results of our metabolome analysis that intracellular
lysine, arginine, and ornithine were significantly higher
in HNF1β-high cells (Fig. S2) is compatible for high
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expression of rBAT in HNF1β-high OCCC cells.
Furthermore, knockdown of rBAT by sh-RNA resulted
in decreased levels of intracellular GSH and increased
ROS activity both with and without oxidative stress
(Fig. 7d – 7f), suggesting that rBAT plays a major role in
HNF1β-triggered ROS resistance in OCCC cells. This is
the first report to show the importance of rBAT in survival
of cancer cells.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that HNF1β
drastically changes glucose and amino acid metabolism
and that it promotes cell survival in hypoxic conditions
under oxidative stress. These results are compatible with
the fact that most OCCCs originate in endometriotic cysts
and survive under severely oxidative conditions [11]. It
is well known that OCCC is resistant to conventional
chemotherapy and that a novel therapeutic modality is
needed. Our findings here may provide several new clues
to aid in the treatment of this disease (Fig. S6). First,
HNF1β-induced aerobic glycolysis increased stressresistance, hypoxia adaptation, and consequent survival
capacity of OCCC, but these effects are highly glucosedependent. In our assay, actually, the control RMG2 cells
with higher HNF1β expression were more sensitive to
glucose deprivation than were HNF1β knockdown cells,
indicating that glucose uptake and metabolism may be a
therapeutic target in OCCC. Secondly, HNF1β inhibition
with some type of inhibitor, such as the microRNA mir802 [51], may have a therapeutic effect by abrogating
ROS resistance in OCCC. Finally, an inhibitor of GSH
synthesis, such as buthionine sulfoximine [52, 53], or
inhibition of GSH synthesis by targeting the cystine
transporter rBAT, may enhance the effect of conventional
chemotherapy. Further study is needed to explore the
potential of these therapeutic applications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
The OCCC cell line RMG2 was kindly provided
by Dr. Aoki at Keio University, and the OCCC cell line
JHOC5 was purchased from the Riken BioResource
Center. Cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium
(Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biowest, Courtaboeuf Cedex,
France) and penicillin–streptomycin (Nacalai Tesque) in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C.
RMG2 and JHOC5 knockdown cells were
generated by lentiviral transfection using two
different GIPZ Lentiviral shRNAs and a nonsilencing
control RNA (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA)

TGTGACCGTGTCCGG, control/ RHS4348	). We used
10 μg /ml puromycin for selection and confirmed that
over 95% of cells were successfully transfected with RNA
based on GFP fluorescence by fluorescence microscopy.
We checked the transfection efficacies of HNF1β and
rBAT by RT-PCR and western blotting (Fig. S4a, S4b,
S4c, & S4d).

5% CO2 were washed by mannitol solution, quenched by
methanol and collected. Then, 5 × 106 cells from each
condition were diluted with 1000 μl chloroform and
400 μl distilled water, and then centrifuged at 2300 × g
for 5 minutes at 4°C. Replicate 400 μl aliquots of each
supernatant (for anion/cation) were centrifuged at 9100 × g
for 120 minutes at 4°C using a 5 kDa ultrafiltration
membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The supernatant
from each sample was solidified, re-diluted with 50 μl
distilled water, and measured by CE-TOFMS (Capillary
electrophoresis electrospray ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry). This measurement was performed by
Human Metabolome Technologies (HMT) Inc. (Yamagata,
Japan). Based on HMT’s database of the mass-to-charge
ratio (m/z) and the migration time (MT) of peaks detected
in CE-TOFMS, 193 peaks were assigned to candidate
metabolites. Of these 193 metabolites, 87 were quantified
using integrated peak areas obtained from measurements
of chemical standards that were analyzed in parallel with
experimental samples. Others were compared using their
relative peak areas. Data were analyzed using previously
reported methods [54, 55].

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan), treated with the PrimeScript™
RT reagent Kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan), and analyzed
using Light Cycler 480 Real-Time PCR system (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland). The HNF1β, rBAT and HPRT1
(housekeeping gene) primers and probes were designed
using Roche Universal ProbeLibrary Assay Design Center

Microarray analysis
GSE39204 [56], which contained clinical ovarian
cancer specimens from 64 patients (16 OCCC and 48
non-OCCC (29 serous, 13 endometrioid, 2 mucinous,
and 4 others)) who underwent primary surgery at Kyoto
University Hospital between 1997 and 2011, was used for
GSEA and analysis of metabolic-related gene expression.
GSE6008, which was uploaded to publicly
available online databases by Wu R et al. and contained
99 individual ovarian tumors (8 OCCC and 91 nonOCCC (41 serous, 37 endometrioid, 13 mucinous, and
4 individual normal ovary samples)) [30], was also used
for GSEA.
GSE37290 [25], a microarray dataset of
RMG2 HNF1β_sh1 cells and RMG2 control cells, was
also analyzed to evaluate the relevance of HNF1β to
metabolic function in OCCC.
Total RNA expression was analyzed on the HG U133
Plus 2.0 Array (Affymetrix) (GSE39204 and GSE37290)
and the HG_U133A array (Affymetrix) (GSE6008). The
expression intensities were normalized across all samples
using the robust multichip average algorithm [57]. Gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted using
GSEA software (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/
downloads.jsp).

Intracellular ROS analysis
Each cell culture, both with and without oxidative
stress, was washed twice with PBS and then stained with
5 μM CellROX® Deep Red Reagent (Life Technologies,
Japan, Tokyo) with complete medium at 37°C for
30 minutes. The cells were then harvested and washed
with PBS and analyzed using a FACSCalibur cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The results
were analyzed using FlowJo_V10 software. Differences
between groups were assessed based on the mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of FL4.

Intracellular GSH and GSSG analysis
GSH was measured using a GSH/ GSSG quantification assay kit (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan), based on
the enzymatic recycling method. Cultured cells were harvested, treated, measured by absorption spectrometer, and
quantified according to the manufacturer’s manual. (http://
www.dojindo.com/store/p/824-GSSG-GSH-Quantification-Kit.html).
