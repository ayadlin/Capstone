Abstract
MicroRNA dysregulation is observed in different types of
cancer. MiR-21 up-regulation has been reported for the
majority of cancers profiled to date; however, knowledge is
limited on the mechanism of action of miR-21, including
identification of functionally important targets that contribute to its proproliferative and antiapoptotic actions. In this
study, we show for the first time that miR-21 targets multiple
important components of the p53, transforming growth factorB (TGF-B), and mitochondrial apoptosis tumor-suppressive
pathways. Down-regulation of miR-21 in glioblastoma cells
leads to derepression of these pathways, causing repression
of growth, increased apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. These
phenotypes are dependent on two of the miR-21 targets
validated in this study, HNRPK and TAp63. These findings
establish miR-21 as an important oncogene that targets
a network of p53, TGF-B, and mitochondrial apoptosis
tumor suppressor genes in glioblastoma cells. [Cancer Res
2008;68(19):8164–72]

Introduction
With over 500 microRNA (miRNA) genes identified experimentally in the human genome and a plethora of computationally
predicted mRNA targets, it is believed that these small RNAs have
a central role in diverse cellular and developmental processes.
Therefore, aberrant expression of miRNA genes could lead to
human disease, including cancer (1–3). Several studies have
confirmed that miRNAs regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis
(2, 4, 5).
In recent years, several profiling studies have reported
dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer (6–8). The majority of these
profiling studies have reported increased levels of miR-21 in most
human cancers (6, 8–10). High levels of miR-21 were first reported
in glioblastoma tumors and cell lines (6). In the same study,
inhibition of miR-21 by LNA or 2¶O-Me-miR-21 led to increased
caspase-dependent apoptosis, suggesting that miR-21 could be
acting as an oncogene to inhibit apoptosis in glioblastoma cells
(6). Further studies showed that miR-21 had the same antiapoptotic role in other cancer types, such as cholangiocarcinomas
and breast cancer cells (10, 11). Recently, a study determined that
miR-21 knockdown in glioblastoma cells significantly repressed
tumor formation in vivo (12).

Gliomas are the most common primary tumors in the brain and
are divided into four clinical grades on the basis of their histology
and prognosis. Grade IV glioblastoma is the most malignant of all
brain tumors and is almost always fatal. Glioblastoma either arise
de novo or progress from lower grade to higher grade over time.
The treatment strategies for this disease have not changed
appreciably for many years, and most are based on a limited
understanding of the biology of the disease (13).
Although miR-21 is emerging as a novel oncogene, its
mechanism of action is largely unknown. Three miR-21 targets
have, thus far, been described: phosphatase and tensin homologue
(PTEN), programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) and Tropomyosin 1
(TPM1; refs. 10, 14–16). However, these targets do not fully
elucidate the antiapoptotic function of miR-21 in glioblastomas
and other types of cancer. PTEN, a well-studied tumor suppressor
gene is inactive in a large number of cancers where miR-21 is upregulated, including glioblastomas (17, 18). On the other hand,
knowledge is limited on the contribution of PDCD4 and TPM1 to
the malignant phenotype of glioblastomas.
The p53 tumor suppressor is at the center of many cellular
pathways that respond to DNA damage, improper mitogenic
stimulation, and cellular stress. p53 is activated by such signals and
can facilitate growth arrest, promote apoptosis, or mediate DNA
repair in a context-dependent manner (19). The importance of p53
in preventing tumor formation is indicated by the presence of
mutations in the p53 pathway in nearly all cancers (20).
Additionally, there are two homologues of p53, tumor protein p63
(TP73L) and tumor protein p73 (TP73), which also perform many
of the p53 functions (19). Studies have shown that p53 activation is
mediated by several different factors that respond to oncogenic
stimuli and assist p53 by either stabilizing it or acting as cofactors
in transcriptional activation or repression of certain genes to
promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (21). These factors include
tumor protein p53 binding protein 2 (TP53BP2), topoisomerase I
binding (TOPORS), junction-mediating and regulatory protein
(JMY), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRPK), and
death-associated protein 6 (DAXX; refs. 21–26). A recent publication revealed a correlation between miR-21 and some transcripts
that are up-regulated in response to p53 activation; however, they
failed to determine the mechanism of interaction between miR-21
and p53 (15).
Transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) is the quintessential
growth inhibitory cytokine that can also induce apoptosis. As a
mediator of growth arrest, it can activate the cyclin-dependent
kinase (CDK) inhibitor CDKN1A (p21) and repress the growthpromoting transcription factor c-MYC. In addition, DAXX has been
implicated as a mediator of TGF-h apoptotic signals by virtue of its
physical association with TGF-h receptor II/III (TGFBR2/3) and its
requirement for TGF-h–induced apoptosis (27). These various
components of the TGF-h apoptotic program ultimately couple the
TGF-h signal to the core components of the cell death machinery.

MiR-21 Targets a Tumor Suppressor Network

Recently, a computational study showed a correlation between
miR-21 and certain components of the TGF-h pathway in a model
of epithelial cell plasticity underlying epidermal injury and skin
carcinogenesis (28).
Cellular apoptosis to a large extent is mediated by a pathway of
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which involves
several proteins including voltage-dependent anion channel 1
(VDAC1) and peptidylprolyl isomerase F (PPIF), resulting in release
of cytochrome c. Cytochrome c interacts with cytosolic apoptotic
peptidase activating factor 1 (APAF1), which in turn activates
caspase-9 and subsequently caspase-3/7. This intrinsic mechanism
of apoptotic activation is disrupted in many cancers, which evade
apoptosis (29).
The goal of our study is to decipher the mechanism of action of
miR-21 in glioblastomas by identifying some of the most essential
tumor-suppressive targets of miR-21 in addition to observing
downstream effects with important functional implications. This
report is the first to show that miR-21 is in the nexus of direct and
indirect negative regulation of a plethora of genes involved in p53,
TGF-h, and apoptotic signaling, which establishes its function as
an oncogene.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies, reagents, and plasmids. The following antibodies were
used for immunoblotting: rabbit DAXX (Santa Cruz), h-actin (Sigma),
mouse APAF1 monoclonal (R&D Systems), and mouse p53 monoclonal
(BD Biosciences), rabbit polyclonal TAp63 (Biolegend), rabbit polyclonal
p21 (Santa Cruz), goat anti-TGFBR2 (Abcam). Secondary antibodies
used include goat anti-mouse secondary Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular
Probes), goat anti-rabbit IRDye 800CW, and donkey anti-goat IRDye 800CW
(LI-COR).
Plasmids for lentiviral preparation, pLVTHM, psPAX2, and pMD2.G, were
obtained from addgene (Trono Lab). Lentiviral production and titration
were performed, as previously published (30).
Doxorubicin (Calbiochem) was used at 1, 12.5, 25, and 50 Amol/L.
Nocodazole (Calbiochem) was used at 250 ng/mL.
Cell culture and Western blots. Human U251, U87, and HeLa cells were
grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomicyn
(Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37jC. Cells were lysed
using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Protein
concentration was estimated by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit
(Pierce). Protein was then separated on a 4% to 20% Novex tris-glycine gels
(Invitrogen), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with the
relevant antibodies, and detected with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies.
Bands were visualized using Li-Cor Odyssey IR imager (LICOR).
Transfections. To down-regulate miR-21 in U251 and U87 cells, we
used 30 pmol LNA-miR-21 (locked bases underlined) TCAACATCAGTCTGATAAGCTA (Sigma Proligo), 2¶-O-me-miR-21 (Anti-miR-21; Ambion),
or a respective nonsilencing scrambled sequence CATTAATGTCGGACAACTCAAT. Transfections were performed using Lullaby small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection reagent (OZ Biosciences) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. At 24 h later, cells were lysed for immunoblotting and/or RNA.
For siRNA/LNA dual transfections, we also used 30 pmol of siRNA and
LNA, respectively. siRNA target sequences HNRPK AAUAUUAAGGCUCUCCGUACA, TAp63 GAUGGUGCGACAAACAAGA, and Scramble UGCGGAUUCUAUCUGUGAU.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR analysis. RNA was extracted by
using the miRVana isolation kit (Ambion) followed by Turbo DNase
treatment (DNA-free, Ambion). For mRNA profiling, reverse transcription
(RT) was performed by using Superscript II first strand synthesis kit
(Invitrogen). Real-time PCR to assay mRNA levels was performed in an
Applied Biosystems PRISM 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System with SYBR
green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). To check miRNA levels, RT was

www.aacrjournals.org

performed using MMLV reverse transcriptase and the RT primers for miR21 and control RNU6B (Applied Biosystems). Taqman real-time PCR
reaction was performed using Fast TaqMan Universal Master Mix and the
TaqMan probe and forward primer for miR-21 or RNU6B. All primers were
provided by Applied Biosystems. All reactions were performed according to
manufacturer’s protocols. Normalizations for mRNA and miRNA real-time
PCR were performed using the Ct of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and RNU6B, respectively.
Dual luciferase assay. Firefly luciferase reporter vector pMIR-Report
(Ambion) was used for these experiments. Downstream of the luciferase
gene, we inserted a 60-bp sequence of the 3¶ untranslated region (UTR) of
the gene of interest containing the miR-21 predicted target site. Assay was
performed as previously published (31).
Cell growth assays. U251 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 8,000 per
well and transfected with 50 nmol/L of LNA-miR-21 (Sigma Genosys),
50 nmol/L of negative control LNA-scramble (Sigma Genosys), or transfection reagent alone. Cell Titer Glo (Promega) reagent was used to determine growth at days 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Results represent the means of three
separate experiments.
Apoptosis assays. For caspase-3/caspase-7 assays, U251 and U87 cells
were seeded in 96-well plates 72 h before assay and transduced using virusexpressing miR-21 or negative control scrambled. At 24 h later, three
different concentrations 0/12.5/25/50 Amol/L of doxorubicin were added to
the cells. At 24 h later, caspase-3/caspase-7 Glo (Promega) reagent was used
to determine relative apoptosis. Results represent the means of three
separate experiments.
For Annexin V assays, we harvested U251 and U87 cells 24 and 48 h
posttransfection and used the Annexin V-PE Apoptosis Detection kit
(Biovision) to detect Annexin V. Results were obtained using Guava
EasyCyte Flow Cytometer (Guava Technologies). The amount of Annexin V
is given as a fold change of the LNA-mir-21 treated relative to the LNA-scr
cells.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were transfected with 50 nmol/L LNA-scram
or LNA-miR-21. U251 and U87 cells were synchronized with nocodazole
(250 ng/mL) and/or doxorubicin (1 Aumol/L) 24 and 48 h posttransfection,
respectively. Cells were released 16 to 20 h later, and cell cycle distributions
were assayed by ethanol fixation overnight and propidium iodide (PI)
staining followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using Guava
EasyCyte Flow Cytometer (Guava Technologies).
Target prediction and network analysis. Conserved and nonconserved
targets of miR-21 were identified using TargetScan 3.1. List of predicted
targets was obtained from TargetScan data download.3 Total number of
human miR-21 targets from TargetScan 3.1 is 1,398, including duplicates.
The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis 3.0 (Ingenuity Systems4) was used to
analyze the list of predicted miR-21 targets. Filtering was performed to
remove duplicates and genes with no annotation in ingenuity pathway
analysis (IPA), resulting in a list of 765 network eligible genes. Each gene
identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the Ingenuity
Pathways Knowledge Base. Networks of genes were then algorithmically
generated. GO analysis was also performed using IPA.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was either determined by
ANOVA or Student’s t test. Statistical significance is displayed as P < 0.05
(*) or P < 0.01 (**).

Results
MiR-21 predicted targets form network of interactions.
Given the potential of miRNAs to regulate a large number of
cellular transcripts, we decided to take a broad approach to
identify targets and determine the mechanism by which miR-21
acts as an oncogene in cancer cells. We first chose to assemble a

Figure 1. MiR-21 predicted targets form a network of interactions. Network of interactions was constructed using IPA software. The input was all the TargetScan
predicted miR-21 targets (conserved and nonconserved) that had cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis annotations. The genes in bold circles are the predicted
targets. Dashed lines annotate unknown transitions in the interactions. Round, square, and solid triangles indicate TGF-h, p53, and mitochondrial apoptosis

list of miR-21 predicted targets using TargetScan 3.1, which
included both conserved and nonconserved targets in humans.
Using IPA, we performed GO analysis to identify the subset of
predicted targets (Supplementary Table S1) that are involved in
regulating growth or apoptosis. Interestingly, among the statistically significant annotations, we found headings for cell growth and
proliferation, cell death, cancer, and cell cycle (Supplementary
Table S1). We then chose the genes from the above annotations and
used IPA to determine whether these predicted targets formed a
network of interactions. To construct the network, we included
additional nodes which were not predicted as targets. Interestingly,
we observed that there were three distinct networks in the
interactome, which included genes from the TGF-h, p53, and
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Fig. 1).
Several genes within this TGF-h pathway were predicted targets
of miR-21, including TGFBR2, TGFBR3, and DAXX. The TGF-h
pathway is known to induce apoptosis in cancer cells and also
during development in response to TGF-h ligand binding to its
receptors, TGFBR2 and TGFBR3, which in turn can inhibit growth
and activate apoptosis either through activation of SMAD
transcription or DAXX, respectively (27).
p53 pathway predicted targets included the tumor-suppressive
homologue of p53, TP73L (TAp63), and activating cofactors of p53,
such as JMY, TOPORS, HNRPK, and TP53BP2 (19, 21–26). All the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

above genes are known to associate with p53 and assist in the
transcriptional activation of antiproliferative and proapoptotic
genes in response to DNA damage. Other p53-related targets
include genes transactivated by p53 in response to DNA damage.
The mitochondrial-apoptotic pathway genes included important
apoptotic inducers, such as APAF1, caspase-8, and proteins that
control mitochondria permeability and cytochrome c release, such
as VDAC1 and PPIF (29).
MiR-21 suppresses major components of key tumorsuppressive pathways. Often, miRNAs can reduce the level of
target transcripts (32, 33). Therefore, we assayed the mRNA levels
of miR-21 predicted targets and other genes in the network by
real-time PCR in response to miR-21 down-regulation (Supplementary Table S2). We chose to perform these experiments in
U251, a glioblastoma multiforme cell line that contains the highest
levels of miR-21 compared with all cancer cell lines that we assayed
by single-plex real-time PCR analysis (data not shown).
To observe changes in the transcripts of genes that are
repressed by miR-21 in U251 cells, we had to achieve a significant
down-regulation of miR-21 levels. To determine the best method
to down-regulate miR-21, we tested both 2¶-O-me-miR-21 and
LNA-miR-21 (Supplementary Fig. S1). We observed a much greater
knockdown with the use of LNA-miR-21 and decided to use it for
our further studies.

MiR-21 Targets a Tumor Suppressor Network

Upon down-regulation of miR-21 with LNA, we observed
significant increases ranging from 2-fold to 16-fold in the levels
of major components of the p53/TGF-h/apoptotic pathways,
including many of the predicted targets (Fig. 2). The p53 pathway
was derepressed to a great extent in response to miR-21
knockdown. Several p53 cofactors and activators, JMY, TP53BP2,
HNRPK, and TOPORS, which are predicted targets of miR-21,
increased significantly in addition to up-regulation of p53 and its
other two homologues, TP73L (TAp63) and TP73. Additionally,
we observed increases in several transactivation targets of p53,
such as IGFBP3, TNSFRSF10B, NOXA, p21 (CDKN1A), and
GADD45A, which are expected due to the increase of p53 and
its homologues (Fig. 2A; refs. 19, 34). However, some of this
deregulation may occur through direct targeting by miR-21, for
example, IGFBP3 contains a predicted miR-21 target site; therefore
up-regulation could occur because IGFBP3 is a direct target of
miR-21.
We observed significant changes in the levels of many TGF-h
pathway genes, including receptors TGFBR2/TGFBR3, their ligands
TGFB1/TGFB2, DAXX, and the transcription factor SMAD3, which
is activated in response to TGFB1/2 binding to the receptors

(Fig. 2B). In addition, PDCD4, which is involved in mediating TGFh–induced apoptosis, increased f8-fold (35). From these transcripts, only the two receptors and DAXX are predicted targets of
miR-21. The up-regulation of all these TGF-h pathway genes could
also explain the increase in p21, which is also transactivated by
SMAD2/3/4 (27).
Several of the genes involved in mitochondrial apoptosis were
also up-regulated in response to miR-21 down-regulation, including
APAF1, PPIF, and caspase-3 (CASP3). APAF1 and PPIF are both
predicted targets of miR-21 (Fig. 2C). Up-regulation of these
transcripts is significant because of their importance in mediating
mitochondrial apoptosis by cytochrome c release in response to a
large number of upstream apoptotic stimuli (29).
A subset of the derepressed transcripts, APAF1, BMPR2, PDCD4,
and p21 were reported to be up-regulated in MCF-7 breast cancer
cells with LNA-miR-21 treatment (15). This confirms that many of
the transcripts we identified may also be regulated by miR-21 in
other types of cancer.
MiR-21 target validation. A selection of candidate targets
whose mRNA levels were deregulated in response to miR-21 downregulation was validated by luciferase and Western blotting. To test

whether the regulation of the predicted target transcripts, whose
levels changed, was direct, we fused 60-bp sequences of the 3¶ UTR
from each candidate containing the predicted miR-21 target site to
a firefly luciferase gene. Cotransfection with pre-miR-21, but not
prescrambled sequence, specifically decreased luciferase levels of
the reporter of JMY, TGFBR2, TGFBR3, HNRPK, TP73L (TAp63),
APAF1, BMPR2, TOPORS, DAXX, TP53BP2, and PPIF (Fig. 3A–C).
On the other hand, we did not observe a change in luciferase levels
for IGFBP3. A positive control reporter bearing a sequence exactly
complementary to miR-21 exhibited a 70% decrease in luciferase
activity (positive anti–miR-21). Three base mutations within the
miR-21 binding site in the positive control reporter completely
abolished the effect of the miRNA (negative anti–miR-21). A known
target of miR-21, PDCD4, showed a f30% decrease in luciferase
activity (14, 15). An additional positive control required cotransfection of let-7a miRNA and its target, a lin-41 whole 3¶ UTR construct, which induced a 70% decrease in luciferase (36).
On transfection of LNA-miR-21 into U251 cells, we observed the
expected 2-fold to 3-fold increase in protein level of each target
examined (Fig. 4A). Therefore, the target validation and the changes
in transcript levels of the targets translate to changes in protein
levels. We also observed increases in proteins, such as p53, DNA
damage-activated p53 (Ser15), and p21, which are not targets but are
indirectly negatively regulated by miR-21 (Fig. 2).

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

To verify that the changes we observed in the targets were
not cell line or cancer type–specific, we overexpressed miR-21 in
HeLa cells where the levels of miR-21 are moderate compared with
U251 (data not shown). Upon ectopic overexpression of miR-21 by
a lentiviral system, we observed significant decreases in the levels
of APAF1, DAXX, TAp63 (TP73L), and TGFBR2 compared with
the empty vector negative control. However, we did not detect
any changes in p53 or its downstream target p21, which could
potentially be explained due to the effect of HPV-E6, a viral antigen
that inhibits p53 dissociation from MDM2 (37). Taken together,
miR-21 dysregulation significantly changes the protein levels of
its targets in both glioblastoma and cervical cancer cells.
MiR-21 is necessary for suppression of apoptosis in
glioblastoma cells. The antiapoptotic role of miR-21 has been
reported in several different studies. Our real-time PCR and protein
data suggest that, upon down-regulation of miR-21 in U251 cells,
the levels of targets in the TGF-h, p53, and apoptotic pathway,
which have known proapoptotic effects, increase significantly (19,
27, 29). Therefore, we tested the effect of miR-21 down-regulation
on the apoptosis of U251 and the additional glioblastoma cell line
U87. On transfection of LNA-miR-21 in U251 and U87 cells, we
observed 1.5-fold to 2-fold increase in the levels of an early marker of
apoptosis, Annexin V, after 24 and 48 hours, respectively, compared
with the negative control LNA-scrambled (Fig. 5A). Additionally, we

MiR-21 Targets a Tumor Suppressor Network

looked at the effect of 2¶-O-Me-mir-21 treatments on the levels of
Annexin V; however, the increase of apoptotic cells in this case was
significantly less when compared with the effect of LNA-miR-21
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). The increased apoptosis confirmed that
miR-21 is acting as a suppressor of cell death in glioblastoma cells.
Furthermore, the differential effect of 2¶O-Me-miR-21 and LNAmiR-21 indicated the necessity for a sufficient magnitude of
decrease in miR-21 levels to cause significant phenotypic effects.
We then tested whether some of the validated mir-21 targets
were required for the apoptotic phenotype, which we observe when
mir-21 is down-regulated by addition of LNA-mir-21 to U251 cells.
To test this, we performed siRNA against validated miR-21 targets
TAp63 and HNRPK, which were chosen based on their key position
in the network (Fig. 1). We used siRNA sequences that were
previously tested and published along with a scramble negative
control siRNA (22, 38). Once we confirmed that the siRNA
sequences were effective at down-regulating the mRNA of the
target genes (data not shown), we introduced the siRNA sequences
with LNA-mir-21 or LNA-scr in U251 cells and assayed the levels of
Annexin V 24 hours posttransfection. There was f25% decrease in
Annexin V induction in siRNA-TAp63 and siRNA-HNRPK–treated
cells (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that HNRPK and TAp63 are
essential for the antiapoptotic function of miR-21.
MiR-21 suppresses p53-mediated apoptosis in U251 cells.
The targeting of important p53 cofactors by miR-21 and the
up-regulation of essential mediators of p53 tumor suppression in
response to miR-21 knockdown led us to the hypothesis that
miR-21 may be inhibiting p53-mediated apoptosis. To test this

of miR-21 targets DAXX, APAF1, TAp63 (TP73L), TGFBR2, and nondirect
targets p53 and p21. B, changes in the protein levels of the indicated miR-21
targets were confirmed in HeLa cell lysates in response to miR-21 up-regulation

hypothesis, we compared apoptosis induction by addition of
different doses of doxorubicin (adriamycin), a chemotherapeutic
drug widely used to activate p53-mediated apoptosis by DNA
damage in the presence or absence of miR-21 overexpression (39).
For both U251 and U87 cell lines, cells expressing the scrambled
control showed a predicted dose-dependent increase in caspase-3/
caspase-7 activity, whereas the cells expressing miR-21 did not
respond to the drug treatment even at higher doses (Fig. 5C). This
result indicates that miR-21 up-regulation in cancer cells is
sufficient to inhibit p53-mediated apoptosis, thus protecting the
cells from p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage
induced by a chemotherapeutic agent.
MiR-21 knockdown suppresses growth of glioblastoma cells.
Our mRNA, protein, and luciferase data indicate a broad
dysregulation of many important tumor-suppressive genes with
known effects on cellular growth. The observed increase in TGF-h
pathway components in addition to p53, p21, and GADD45A
suggests a potential modulation of cell growth in addition to
apoptosis (Figs. 2 and 4A). To test the effect of miR-21 on the
growth of U251 and U87 cells, we knocked down miR-21 using
LNA-miR-21 in both U251 and U87 cells and assayed cell growth
over 4 days. Interestingly, we observed a significant suppression in
growth of cells in which miR-21 was knocked down compared with
negative controls, LNA-scrambled, and the mock (Fig. 6A). This
retarded growth continued throughout the 4 days with the most
significant difference observed on day 3. The negative control
LNA-scrambled and mock did not show any significant growth
difference, suggesting that the LNA treatment itself does not affect
growth. These results suggest that miR-21 plays an essential role in
the proliferative capacity of glioblastoma cells.
MiR-21 knockdown led to cell cycle arrest. To test whether
the effect on cell growth is occurring due to cell cycle arrest,
another hallmark of p53 function, we decided to see the effect that
miR-21 knockdown has on the cell cycle of U251 and U87 cells.
We transfected both cell lines with LNA-miR-21 or LNA-scr; 24 or
48 h later, cells were synchronized using doxorubicin (G2-M phase)
and nocodazole (M phase); and 20 to 24 h later, we performed cell
cycle analysis by PI staining. Addition of LNA-miR-21 (50 nmol/L)
caused a significant increase in the population of cells in G0-G1
phase compared with LNA-scr treatments in both U251 and U87
cells (Fig. 6B). For U251 cells, we observed a 21% and 25% increase
in cells arrested at G0-G1 with nocodazole and doxorubicin
synchronization, respectively, in the cells where miR-21 was
knocked down (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S2B). These
experiments show that miR-21 is required for progression through
the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle in glioblastomas cells.
To determine whether HNRPK and TAp63 contribute to the cell
cycle arrest observed in response to mir-21 down-regulation, we
used the same siRNAs previously tested in the Annexin V assays. At
24 h posttransfection of each siRNA with LNA-scr or LNA-miR-21,
we added nocodazole to synchronize cells. At 16 to 20 h later, we
harvested the cells and performed PI staining for cell cycle analysis.
In the presence of siRNA-HNRPK and siRNA-TAp63, we observed a
2-fold decrease in the proportion of cells arrested in G0-G1 in
response to miR-21 down-regulation. Therefore, HNRPK and TAp63
are important targets for miR-21–mediated cell cycle progression.

Discussion
The emerging significance of miRNAs in cancer has spiked major
interest in recent years resulting in numerous cancer profiling
studies. In this study, we have addressed the mechanisms by which

Figure 5. MiR-21 suppresses apoptosis in U251 cells. A, Annexin V
staining was performed 24 and 48 h posttransfection of U251 and
U87 cells with LNA-miR-21 (50 nmol/L) or negative control LNA-scr
(50 nmol/L). Detection was performed using flow cytometry. B, Annexin V

TAp63, and negative control scramble in the presence of LNA-scr or
LNA-miR-21. C, MiR-21 up-regulation suppresses p53-mediated
apoptosis. U251 and U87 cells were transduced with empty or
mir-21–expressing lentivirus. 48 h after transduction, cells were treated
with indicated doses of doxorubicin, and apoptosis was assayed 24 h later
by caspase-3/7 activity using the Caspase-3/7 Glo. Student’s t test
was performed. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.

miR-21 contributes to the transformed state of glioblastoma cells
by identifying targets in important tumor-suppressive pathways,
such as p53, TGF-h, and mitochondrial apoptosis. These data were
first reported in our poster at the miRNAs in Cancer Keystone
meeting (Papagiannakopoulos et al., 2007).
Our approach links putative targets around a function and
succeeds in identifying not only multiple targets but uncover an
entire network under miRNA control. One gets no sense of the
thematic relationship among targets from currently popular in silico
search algorithms for miRNA targets. Current methods tend to
identify targets one at a time, which leads to highly skewed misunderstandings of miRNA function and is a hopelessly exhaustive
task. We know that miRNAs have hundreds of targets; however,
this fact must be understood in the context of the somewhat
dichotomous observation that an miRNA sometimes seems to
have its predominant phenotypic effect on a single mRNA. First,
by getting a foothold on a functional network of genes, one can
systematically analyze each component of the network for direct
and indirect effects of the miRNA, which in our case was miR-21.
The miR-21 targets we identified included p53 homologue, p63,
p53 activators JMY, TOPORS, TP53BP2, DAXX, and HNRPK, which
can stabilize p53 protein levels by interfering with MDM2 and/or
act as p53 transcriptional cofactors, assisting p53 in transactivating
genes that can induce apoptosis and growth arrest (21–26). These
targets are required for p53 tumor-suppressive activity; therefore,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

by targeting these genes, miR-21 can impair p53 response to
stimuli, such as DNA damage. MiR-21 repressed p53-mediated
apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic (doxorubicin)–induced
DNA damage, therefore contributing to drug resistance in glioblastoma cells. MiR-21 suppression of the p53 response may take
place in most cancers where miR-21 is up-regulated, and this oncogenic mechanism may be even more significant contributor to
malignancy in tumors with wild-type p53. Regulation of these
p53-related targets by miR-21 may potentially explain previous
observations in breast cancer cells, where p53-transactivated genes
were up-regulated in response to miR-21 down-regulation (15).
The regulation of the TGF-h pathway is also critical for the
transformed state of glioblastomas, particularly due to the fact that
gliomas become resistant to TGF-h. This resistance may be partly
due to the negative regulation of multiple components of the
pathway of miR-21, including the indirect regulation of TGFB1/2
and the direct targeting of the receptors TGFBR2/3 and the
apoptotic mediator DAXX. DAXX, which can stabilize p53 in
addition to mediating TGF-h apoptosis, plays a role in both
pathways and, therefore, may be a key target in disrupting crosstalk between the two pathways (Supplementary Fig. S3). The
functional convergence of p53 and TGF-h pathways has been
previously reported by several studies, which reported assistance
and necessity of p53/p63/p73 for TGF-h–mediated transactivation
of certain antiproliferative and proapoptotic factors, such as p21

MiR-21 Targets a Tumor Suppressor Network

(40, 41). Interestingly, a transcriptional target of the functional convergence of these pathways is SERPINB5, the transcript most highly
up-regulated in response to miR-21 knockdown (Fig. 2A; ref. 42).
Derepression of the p53 pathway in response to miR-21 downregulation may assist in the derepression of the cytostatic response
of TGF-h signaling, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
We have shown that miR-21 regulates sets of genes, and the
regulation is direct through targeting of certain transcripts, and in
other cases, the effects are indirect. This finding is in agreement
with limited data from other laboratories that suggests that many
miRNAs have evolved to regulate multiple components of certain
pathways, thus mediating a more effective negative regulation on
those pathways (33). These data are also consistent with findings in
glioblastomas that significant effects of miRNAs occur indirectly
rather than by direct targeting (24, 43).
The phenotypic effects observed upon down-regulation of miR21 in glioblastoma cells reflect the significant repression of multiple
components of the p53, TGF-h, and apoptotic pathways by miR-21.
We were able to show these effects in two established glioblastoma
cells lines, U251 and U87. When miR-21 levels were decreased, we
observed a significant increase in apoptotic cells, as has been
previously reported (6). In addition, miR-21 down-regulation significantly represses growth and leads to cell cycle arrest at G0-G1,
which can be explained by the up-regulation of p21 (Figs. 2A
and 4A), a protein that is known to regulate cell cycle checkpoints

in response to its transactivation by p53. In accordance, we observe
a significant increase in the protein levels of p53 (Ser15; Fig. 4A),
which occurs in response to DNA damage and can mediate cell
cycle arrest at G0-G1 by transactivation of p21 (19). Both the
apoptotic and cell cycle phenotypes, which we observed in the
absence of miR-21, are partly dependent on two miR-21 targets,
HNRPK and TAp63. Both of these targets play an essential role in
the oncogenic function of miR-21. HNRPK is a known coactivator
of p53 in response to DNA damage, assisting in the transactivation
of p21 and GADD45A (22). TAp63 is a homologue of p53 and is
known to mediate both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (19, 38).
However, the inability of their knockdown to completely rescue the
proapoptotic and cell cycle arrest phenotypes, which are observed
in the absence of miR-21, suggests that there are other critical miR21 targets involved in mediating miR-21 oncogenic phenotypes.
The effects we describe when we knockdown miR-21 suggest
that miR-21 lies embedded in a nexus of tumor suppression genes
and has multiple specific targets in the network that lead to the
observed phenotypes. These broad effects enable miR-21 to act
as a key oncogene modulating cell growth, desensitizing cells to
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Supplementary Fig. S3). Cellular
mechanisms that control apoptosis, cell growth, and cell cycle
function as efficient fail-safe mechanisms to prevent cancer
development, despite the trillions of somatic cell divisions that
occur during a human lifetime. Cancer cells therefore only survive

Figure 6. MiR-21 knockdown suppresses U251 cell growth and leads to cell cycle arrest. A, U251 (black ) and U87 (gray ) cells were transfected with LNA-miR-21
(50 nmol/L) or LNA-scr (50 nmol/L) and mock with just transfection reagent. Cell growth was determined using Cell Titer Glo assay performed at day 0, 1, 2,
3, and 4. B, U251 cells were transfected with LNA-miR-21 (50 nmol/L) or LNA-scram (50 nmol/L), and cells were synchronized using nocodazole (250 ng/mL).
U251 (24 h) and U87 (48 h) cells were harvested for cell cycle analysis using PI staining 20 and 24 h, respectively, after addition of nocodazole. C, PI staining performed
24 h posttransfection of siRNA sequences for HNRPK, TAp63, and negative control scramble in the presence of LNA-scr or LNA-miR-21. Data represent proportion
of U251 cells in G0-G1. The amount of cells accumulating in G1 is given as a fold change of the LNA-mir-21 treated relative to the LNA-scr cells. Student’s t test
was performed. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01.

if the apoptotic response is dampened or disrupted, cell cycle
checkpoints are evaded, and unrestricted cell proliferation occurs
(44). Due to the functional relationship among miR-21 targets,
changes in the level of miR-21 is likely to dampen the robustness of
a highly interconnected tumor-suppressive network and result in
global regulation or dysregulation of the network functions. Our
data suggest that miR-21 up-regulation may be a key step leading
to oncogenesis in glioblastoma and other types of cancer.
Furthermore, targeted down-regulation of miR-21 in human tumors
and particularly glioblastoma, which are fatal, could prove of high
therapeutic value.
