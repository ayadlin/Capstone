ABSTRACT
Drug resistance remains the major clinical barrier to successful treatment
in epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) patients, and the evidence of microRNA
involvement in drug resistance has been recently emerging. Endothelin-1 (ET-1)/
ETA receptor (ETAR) axis is aberrantly activated in chemoresistant EOC cells and
elicits pleiotropic effects promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
the acquisition of chemoresistance. However, the relationship between ETAR and
miRNA is still unknown. Hence, in this study we evaluated whether dysregulation of
miRNA might enhance ETAR expression in sensitive and resistant EOC cells. Based on
bioinformatic tools, we selected putative miRNA able to recognize the 3′UTR of ETAR.
An inverse correlation was observed between the expression levels of miR-30a and
ETAR in both EOC cell lines and tumor samples. miR-30a was found to specifically
bind to the 3′UTR of ETAR mRNA, indicating that ETAR is a direct target of miR-30a.
Overexpression of miR-30a decreased Akt and mitogen activated protein kinase
signaling pathway activation, cell proliferation, invasion, plasticity, EMT marker levels,
and vascular endothelial growth factor release. Interestingly, ectopic expression
of miR-30a re-sensitized platinum-resistant EOC cells to cisplatinum-induced
apoptosis. Consistently, resistant EOC xenografts overexpressing miR-30a resulted
in significantly less tumor growth than controls. Together our study provides a new
perspective on the regulatory mechanism of ETAR gene. Interestingly, our findings
highlight that blockade of ETAR regulatory axis is the mechanism underlying the tumor
suppressor function of miR-30a in chemoresistant EOC cells.

is mandatory to achieve advancement in EOC therapy.
An aberrant activation of endothelin-1 (ET-1) axis, which
consists of the ligand ET-1 and its G-protein coupled
receptors (GPCR) endothelin A receptor (ETAR) and ETBR,
is now recognized as a common mechanism underlying
the progression of various solid tumors, including EOC
[3]. In particular, ETAR overexpression is associated with
the acquisition of chemoresistance and epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype of EOC [3–7].
The ET-1/ETAR interaction triggers the activation of the
survival pathways, such as phosphoinositide-3-kinase

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) accounts
for the highest tumor-related mortality in women with
gynecologic malignancy [1]. The current therapy for
advanced ovarian cancer is debulking surgery followed
by chemotherapy containing cisplatinum agent and
paclitaxel with the eventual addition of bevacizumab;
however, successful long-term treatment is prevented by
the development of drug resistance [2]. The identification
of the molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance

(PI-3K)/Akt and mitogen activated protein kinase
(MAPK), thus protecting EOC cells from drug-induced
apoptosis [4]. All these observations suggest that ETAR
expression may be a predictor of chemoresistance, and
that targeting ETAR could increase the sensitivity of EOC
tumors to therapeutic agents. In this regard, we recently
provide evidence that ETAR/β-arrestin-1 cooperates with
Wnt signaling to acquire a chemoresistant phenotype
through the amplification of ET-1 autocrine loop, thus
sustaining EMT, stemness features, cell invasion and
metastasis [8]. In addition to ETAR, ETBR also appears
to have important regulatory roles in angiogenesis,
lymphangiogenesis and evasion of the immune response
[3, 8–14], indicating that ETAR and ETBR could serve
as key targets for EOC. The dual receptor antagonist
macitentan, interfering with ETAR, and microenvironmentassociated elements expressing ETBR [12–15], inhibited
growth, vascularization, intravasation and progression in
EOC xenografts [8].
microRNA (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs
19-25 nucleotides in length. Mature forms of miRNA
silence gene expression by binding to the 3′ UTR of target
mRNA and initiate translational repression or cleavage
of cognate mRNA [16]. These molecules have been
recognized as critical regulators of tumor development
and progression, including EOC [17–20]. Moreover,
recent studies demonstrated the involvement of miRNA
in chemoresistance [21–24]. Despite the growing interest
around miRNA in tumor progression and chemoresistance,
currently there are no studies to clarify physiologic and
pathologic implications on ETAR regulation by miRNA.
In this study, we aimed to identify miRNA able to control
ETAR expression overcoming therapy resistance in EOC
cells. miR-30a has attracted much attention due to its
important role in various biological and pathological
processes, including EMT and tumor progression [25,
26]. However, whether miR-30a is involved in the
chemoresistance onset of EOC and the underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood. Employing the
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data [27], we found that
miR-30a downregulation in high-grade serous ovarian
cancer (HG-SOC), which reprents a large majority of EOC
cases, is downregulated compared to normal tissue and is
associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, we show that
miR-30a is downregulated in chemoresistant EOC cells.
Functional studies demonstrate that overexpression of
miR-30a decreases cellular vitality, invasion, plasticity
and EMT. ETAR is identified as a direct target of miR30a, and their expression is inversely correlated in EOC
cell lines and human tissue samples. Upregulation of miR30a re-sensitizes resistant EOC cells to cisplatinum by
binding ETAR. Overexpression of miR-30a inhibits tumor
growth in cisplatinum-resistant xenografts. Our findings
provide a new perspective on the regulatory mechanism
of endogenous ETAR gene at the post-transcriptional
level. Moreover, this study suggests that miR-30a/ETAR
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

axis regulates EOC chemoresistance onset and that
interfering with ETAR function could serve as an important
therapeutic approach for EOC.

RESULTS
miR-30a is downregulated in chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cells
In order to identify miRNA able to bind the ETAR
3′UTR, we performed a computational target prediction
analysis by using TargetScan [28], miRanda [29] and
miRDB [30] bioinformatic algorithms (Supplementary
Figure S1A). ETAR 3′UTR contained a perfect
complementary matching region at nucleotides 1327-1334,
2200-2205, 2321-2327 for miR-30 family (Supplementary
Figure S1B), consisting of six distinct mature miRNA
sequences: miR-30a/miR-30c-2, miR-30d/miR-30b, and
miR-30e/miR-30c-1. To search for the critical miR-30
family members involved in aberrant ETAR expression
reported in chemoresistant EOC cells [4, 8], we firstly
analyzed their expression levels in 2008 and A2780 human
cell lines and in their cisplatinum-resistant variants. Realtime PCR (qPCR) experiments demonstrated that miR-30a
resulted significantly downregulated in both 2008 CIS and
A2780 CIS cells (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure
S1C), expressing higher mRNA and protein levels of ETAR
compared to sensitive cells (Figure 1B and Supplementary
Figure S1D). It is notable that miR-30a expression was also
downregulated in paclitaxel-resistant A2780 cell line, which
overexpressed ETAR [4,8] (Supplementary Figure S1D
and S1E), demonstrating that overexpression of miR-30a
directly binds ETAR, which is responsible for regulating the
rate limiting of both paclitaxel and cisplatinum response.
In a panel of EOC cell lines, the expression of miR30a was substantially decreased and was associated with a
highy expression of ETAR (p = 0.02) (Figure 1B, 1C and 1D).
The ectopic introduction of miR-30a significantly reduced
ETAR protein levels, even in resistant cells expressing
low miR-30a and high ETAR (Figure 1B). miR-30a did
not affect the expression of ETAR mRNA (Supplementary
Figure S1F), indicating that it unlikely inhibits transcription.
Furthermore, we evaluated the expression of miR-30a by
qPCR in a cohort of 39 EOC human tumor samples, whose
clinical-pathological characteristics are summarized in
Supplementary Table S1, and in which the ETAR expression
has been previously examinated by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) [8]. As show in Figure 1E, we found a significant (p =
0.0081) inverse correlation between the expression levels of
ETAR and miR-30a. The median expression value of miR30a, normalized for RNU44 expression, was significantly
lower in tumors expressing high (n = 26) versus low (n = 13)
ETAR levels (median=8.4, range 0.3-21,203 vs median=54
range 3.3-4,045, respectively). These data suggest that
the regulation of miR-3oa/ETAR axis is involved in the
pathobiology of EOC.

directly decreases ETAR expression through sequencespecific binding with 3′UTR of ETAR mRNA. In order to
further confirm miR-30a specificity in ETAR regulation,
we transfected chemoresistant EOC cells with the
antago-miR-30a (anti-miR-30a), chemically engineered
oligonucleotides used to silence endogenous miR-30a.
Importantly, increased levels of ETAR protein was
observed in miR-30a-silenced cells compared to control

activity with ETAR 3′UTR possessing a mutation in the

Overexpression of miR-30a sensitizes EOC cells
to cisplatinum-induced apoptosis

introduction of miR-30a significantly decreased cell
vitality of both sensitive and resistant EOC cells. To
determine whether ETAR inhibition can recapitulate the
effects of miR-30a observed in EOC cells, we explored
molecular ETAR targeting treatment by using the small
molecule macitentan, a potent ETAR antagonist with
significant affinity for ETBR. Following treatment with
macitentan, the cell vitality was significantly decreased.
On the contrary, the silencing of miR-30a enhanced
the proliferation of these cells (Figure 2C). Silencing
of ETAR mimicked the effect of miR-30a inhibiting
cell vitality (Figure 2D and 2E). Importantly, ectopic
introduction of miR-30a in EOC cells overexpressing
ETAR, with an expression vector encoding ETAR
lacking 3′UTR, was unable to completely suppress
cell proliferation (Figure 2D and 2E). Altogether, these
findings demonstrate that miR-30a functionally binds the
ETAR 3′UTR, thereby inhibiting ETAR expression and
cell proliferation.

We next evaluated whether miR-30a could inhibit
the survival pathways activated by ET-1/ETAR axis to
protect tumor cells from drug-induced apoptosis [4].
miR-30a-mediated ETAR inhibition was accompanied
with reduced ET-1-induced phosphorylation of both p42/
p44 MAPK and Akt in A2780 sensitive and cisplatinumresistant cells (Figure 3A). The analysis of cell viability
(Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure S2A) and DNA
fragmentation (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure
S2B) showed that the addition of cisplatinum in cells
overexpressing miR-30a, lead to an enhanced sensitivity
to the chemotherapeutic drug not only in sensitive
but also in resistant cells. In line with these data, by
performing a TUNEL assay in A2780 CIS cells, we
observed a significant increase in the number of apoptotic
cells following the overexpression of miR-30a (46%)

(Figure 3D). Moreover, the addition of cisplatinum in
cells transfected with miR-30a sensitized chemoresistant
cells to cisplatinum-induced apoptosis (82%). As shown in
Figure 3E, overexpression of miR-30a in A2780 sensitive
and resistant cells enhanced the cleavage of poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-7, compared
to the control cells. Importantly, the activation of these
apoptotic markers was more pronounced in the presence
of cisplatinum. Together these results demonstrate that
overexpression of miR-30a re-sensitizes resistant EOC
cells to cisplatinum by targeting ETAR.

[4]. 2008 and A2780 resistant cells expressed enhanced
mRNA levels of Snail and vimentin, associated with a
concomitant decrease of E-cadherin expression (Figure 4A
and Supplementary Figure S3). The overexpression of miR30a restored E-cadherin levels, and inhibited the expression
of both vimentin and Snail (Figure 4A and Supplementary
Figure S3). As determined by western blotting analysis,
in resistant 2008 cells miR-30a overexpression enhanced
E-cadherin and reduced N-cadherin protein expression
(Figure 4B), indicating that this miRNA is able to revert the
EMT phenotype in EOC cells. In line with above results,
transfection with miR-30a resulted in a strong inhibition
of cell invasion of sensitive as well as chemoresistant
2008 cells (Figure 4C). Because in EOC cells, ET-1
through ETAR induces the release of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) [31], which has been reported to
have important regulatory role in drug-sensitivity [22],
we evaluated whether miR-30a was also able to modulate
the release of VEGF by EOC cells. Importantly, miR-30a

transfection in 2008 CIS cells reduced the basal, as well
as the ET-1-induced VEGF production (Figure 5A),
demonstrating that regulation of the miR-30a/ETAR axis
is also important in the release of the angiogenic factor
VEGF. Aggressive EOC cells, expressing high levels of
EMT associated markers, are capable to form vasculogenic
mimicry [32]. Consistently, we found that 2008 and
2008 CIS cells plated on matrigel formed a network of
interconnected tubules (Figure 5B and 5C). Notably,

quantification analysis demonstrated that the length of tubes
and the number of their intersections in chemoresistant
EOC cells increased significantly compared to sensitive
cells. Cells overexpressing miR-30a were unable to form
elongated structures and formed fewer intersections
(Figure 5B and 5C), indicating that ET-1/ETAR pathway
is implicated in the in vitro formation of vasculogenic-like
networks in chemoresistant EOC cells, and that miR-30a
inhibits EMT, cell invasion and plasticity.

faster growth rate. In parallel, western blotting analysis
showed lower levels of ETAR and a significant reduction
of MAPK and Akt activation in miR-30a overexpressing
mice compared with control (Figure 6C). These findings
demonstrate that overexpression of miR-30a results

cohort. We found a strong downregulation of miR-30a
when comparing tumoral (n = 567) and non tumoral (n
= 8) samples in this cohort (p = 0.003; Figure 7A). To
evaluate whether mir30a downregulation has a prognostic
value, we subdivided patients of TCGA cohort into low
or high miR-30a by using z-score higher than 1 (n = 112).
As shown in Figure 7B, low miR-30a expression was
documented in 57 HG-SOC patients (51%) and high miR30a expression in 55 HG-SOC patients (49%; p = 1.8e51). Of clinical relevance, the TCGA data set supported
the association between low miR-30a expression and
poor patient outcome (p = 0.01) (Figure 7C). Univariate
and multivariate analysis revealed the prognostic
role of low miR-30a expression that was independent
from other clinical variables (tumor stage, grade and
treatment response) (Figure 7C). Interestingly, ETAR gene

expression inversely correlated with miR-30a expression
in TCGA dataset. This anticorrelation was also present
when comparing sensitive (n = 229) and resistant (n = 26)
sample patients (Figure 7D). This might suggest that the
overexpression of ETAR due to the loss of miR-30a activity
might contribute to chemoresistance onset. In line with
these observations, we observed a negative correlation
between miR-30a and ETAR, evaluated by IHC in our
sample set of 39 EOC (p = 0.039; Supplementary Table

miR-30a expression groups by using the median value as
the cut-off. Next, we analyzed whether expression of miR30a could correlate with survival analysis in our sample
set. Recurrence/progression of disease was observed in
30 cases (76.9%), while death of disease was documented
in 26 patients (66.7%); Supplementary Figure S5 shows

promoting apoptosis. Importantly, we provide preclinical
experiments setting the scene for a novel miR-30a
function as a tumor suppressor in chemoresistant EOC by
targeting ETAR signaling axis. Abundant ETAR expression
and low expressed miR-30a enhance the acquisition of
an aggressive chemoresistant potential of EOC cells.
The investigation of the mechanism of miR-30a in EOC
reveals that ETAR can be post-transcriptionally regulated
by miR-30a. Several studies have demonstrated that ETAR
signaling contributes to the acquisition of chemoresistance
and EMT [3–5, 8, 33, 34]. In addition, ET-1 is present
at high levels in tumor ascites [35] and high grade
ovarian tumors overexpress ETAR [27, 36], thus making
it imperative to understand the effect of ET-1/ETAR axis
on ovarian tumor biology and the factors that regulate this

DISCUSSION
An in depth understanding of the molecular drivers
of EOC chemoresistance is of paramount importance
for improving the therapeutic regimens. We recently
reported that high levels of ETAR expression are
associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in
EOC [8], however, the molecular mechanisms mediating
chemoresistance remain poorly understood. In this study
we provide the first evidence that downregulation of
miR-30a is a feature of chemoresistant EOC cells. This
decrease is likely to contribute to the chemoresistance
by inhibiting chemotherapy-induced apoptosis through

signaling pathway. A comprehensive analysis recently
highlighted that ETAR overexpression is associated
with worse survival in the groups of proliferative and
mesenchymal HG-SOC [27]. In this context, we recently
reported that ETAR co-opts Wnt/ß-catenin signaling, which
is a critical driver of EOC chemoresistance [37], to acquire
a chemoresistant and mesenchymal phenotype, thus
sustaining tumor progression through a self-strengthening
feedback loop [8]. Here we have shown that miR-30a
inhibits EOC cell invasion, plasticity, and the release of
the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF, that characterize the
chemoresistant behavior and EMT (Figure 6D).
Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown
that miRNA can modulate the sensitivity of EOC to
chemotherapy [21–24]. The most frequently de-regulated
miRNA in chemoresistant EOC are involved in EMT,
as let-7 and miR-200 families [20], or in the receptor
signaling pathways, as miRNA-31 that targets MET [23].
High-throughput analysis of the miRNA profile in a panel
of drug-resistant EOC cells revealed that miR-30c, miR130a and miR-335 were downregulated [21]. Moreover, a
miRNA signature defines EOC chemoresistance through
modulation of angiogenesis, including miR-484 as
regulator of VEGF pathway [22].
miR-30 family members are located on human
chromosome 6q.13 and are among the most dysregulated
miRNA in metastatic cancer [38, 39]. Although recent
findings suggest that miR-30 family functions as tumor
suppressor in many human cancer, including gastric,
anaplastic thyroid, breast, and non-small-cell lung cancers
[25, 26, 40–42], its association with drug resistance has
not been elucidated. Our study highlights a hitherto
unappreciated role of miR-30a in EOC drug resistance
and EMT and defines a unique mechanism by which it
directly targets ETAR signaling axis and contributes to
poor patient outcome. In parallel, inhibition of ETAR
activity, by the approved small molecule macitentan
recapitulated the effect of miR-30a overexpression,
indicating that ETAR target therapy should represent a
novel strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance.
Consistent with in vitro results, we observed that
expression of miR-30a delayed tumor formation in
xenograft tumors, suggesting that miR-30a is one of the
tumor suppressor miRNA and that miR-30a-ETAR axis
plays a crucial role in EOC cell survival. Accordingly,
this miRNA was downregulated in tumor samples of the
TCGA HG-SOC cohort relative to non-tumoral ovarian
tissues. Of translational relevance, in this TCGA dataset
low miR-30a expression correlates with poor outcome.
Multivariante analysis showed that miR-30a expression
had predictive values for overall survival identifying
low expression of miR-30a as an independent prognostic
factor. In line with these results, analysis performed
in our set of EOC tissues suggest that low miR-30a is
associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, the inverse
correlation between miR-30a and ETAR expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

further highlights the pathobiologic relevance of miR-30/
ETAR axis in EOC. These findings are highly supported
by our previous analysis performed on the same cohort of
EOC patients demonstrating that the association between
ETAR expression and poor survival is to be ascribed to
the unfavorable prognostic role of ETAR in the subset of
platinum-resistant cases [8]. In conclusion, our results
reveal a novel mechanism in which miR-30a suppresses
EOC aggressiveness and chemoresistance by inhibiting
ETAR expression at the post-transcriptional level, and
widening the horizon about the regulatory mechanism
of ETAR. These findings also suggest that miR-30a/
ETAR axis may serve as possible target to improve EOC
therapeutic outcome. In light of our findings, the use of
miR-30a to predict prognosis and clinical response to
chemotherapy warrants future evaluation in a large cohort
of patients with EOC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and cell culture conditions
The human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780
was obtained from European Collection of Cell Cultures
(Salisbury, UK). To retain cisplatinum (CIS) and taxol
(TAX) resistance, 1 µM cisplatinum (Pfizer, Italy) and
50 nM paclitaxel (Bristol Myers, Italy) were added to the
culture medium A2780 CIS and A2780 TAX, respectively,
every two passages. The 2008 cell line and its cisplatinumresistant subclone 2008C13 (CIS) were kindly provided
by Dr. S.B. Howell (University of San Diego, La Jolla,
CA, USA). Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, HEY
and OVCA433 were kindly provided by Prof. G. Scambia
(Catholic University School of Medicine, Rome, Italy).
The SKOV-3 cell line was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (VA, USA). All cells, cultured as
previously described [4], were passed in our laboratory
for fewer than 3 months after resuscitation and were tested
routinely for cell proliferation as well as mycoplasma
contamination, and they showed similar growth rate and
negative mycoplasma during the experiments. Cells were
serum starved by incubation in serum-free medium for 24 h.
ET-1 was used at 100 nM and was purchased from Bachem
(Switzerland). Macitentan, also called ACT-064992 or N-(5[4-bromophenyl]-6-{2-[5-bromopyrimidin-2-yloxy]ethoxy}
pyrimidin-4-yl)-N’-propylsulfamide, was added 30 min
before ET-1 at a dose of 1 µM and was kindly provided by
Actelion Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. (Switzerland).

plasmid (Origene, MD, USA) or pGL3-Basic Control
plasmid (Promega, WI, USA) using Lipofectamine 2000
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Stable clones were generated by transfecting
cells with pCMV-miR vector control (Ctr) or miR-30a
expression vector (Origene) using Lipofectamine 2000
and cells were then selected with 700 μg/ml G418 sulfate
(Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corporation, CA, USA). The
exogenous miR-30a over the endogenous counterpart
(vector alone) was monitored by qPCR (Supplementary
Figure S3).

Luciferase reporter gene assay
Cells cultured in 12-well plate were transiently
transfected with 50 nM of mimic-miR-30a or miRnegative control together with 0.5 μg of ETAR 3′UTR
reporter plasmid (Origene) or its mutant (ETAR 3′UTR
1328-1332) by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Transfection efficiency was monitored by cotransfection
with 0.1 μg of pmiR-Report Beta-gal (Life Technologies),
which was used as an internal control. Reporter activity
was measured after 48h using the Luciferase assay
system (Promega) and normalized to β-galactosidase
activity. ETAR 3′UTR reporter plasmid mutagenesis
was performed using the QuikChange Site-Directed

Western blot analysis
Whole cell lysates were prepared using a modified
RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl,
1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1%
SDS) containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Total proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE,
and the antibodies (Abs) used for the study were as
follows: anti-ETAR and anti-β-actin (C-11), purchased
from Abcam (UK) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA,
USA), respectively; anti-p-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/
Tyr204), anti-p44/42 MAPK, anti-pAkt (S473), anti-Akt,
anti-cleaved-PARP (Asp214), and anti-cleaved-caspase
7 (Asp198), were from Cell Signaling Technology
(MA, USA). Anti-E-cadherin and anti-N-cadherin were
purchased from BD Biosciences (CA, USA). Western
blotting filters were developed using the ECL-plus
detection system or, otherwise, the SuperSignal West
Femto kit (Thermo Scientific, IL, USA). Western blots
for ETAR were quantified by densitometric analysis using
ImageJ software.

Cell viability analysis
Sensitive or cisplatinum resistant cells were seeded
in twelve-well plates in triplicate. After 24 h cells were
transfected with miRNA mimics (miR-negative control,
mimic-miR-30a, anti-mimic-miR-30a, si-ETAR or ETAR
plasmid) and/or treated with cisplatinum and macitentan.
After 48-72 h, cells were harvested and counted by using
trypan blue dye exclusion method.

Apoptosis assays
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed
using a commercial apoptosis detection kit (Roche,
Italy) according to the manufacturer’s suggestions.
Breafly, treated cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 4%
Paraformaldehyde (PFA), and permabilized with 0.1%
sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1xPBS for 2

minutes at 4°C. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector
Laboratories, CA, USA) and slides were mounted with
Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector
laboratories). Fluorescence signals were captured at
40X magnitude by using a Leica DMIRE2 microscope
equipped with a Leica DFC 350FX camera and elaborated
by a Leica FW4000 deconvolution software (Leica,
Germany). The percentage of apoptotic cells was
calculated by the ratio of TUNEL-positive nuclei and
total nuclei stained with DAPI. Quantitative detection of
apoptotic cells was also performed on 1x106 cells using
TiterTACS colorimetric apoptosis detection kit (Trevigen,
MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

injected subcutaneously into the flank of female athymic
(nu+/nu+) of 5 mice for group, 4–6 week of age (Charles
River Laboratories, Italy), following the guidelines for
animal experimentation of the Italian Ministry of Health.
Tumor volume was measured with caliper and was
monitored every 4 days and the tumor growth curves were
plotted. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula:
π/6 larger diameter x (smaller diameter)2. At the end of
experiments all the mice were euthanized, the site of
tumors was noted, and the removed tumors were frozen
and analyzed for western blotting.

Chemoinvasion assay

Human tumor and normal ovarian specimens were
kindly provided by Prof. G. Ferrandina from patients
admitted to the Gynecologic Oncology Unit, Catholic
University of Campobasso and Rome (Italy). Human
EOC specimens were collected at time of initial diagnosis
both in patients undergoing maximal cytoreduction and in
patients deemed unresectable and therefore triaged to neoadjuvant chemotherapy; therefore all tissues specimens
were naive to chemotherapy. Tissues specimens were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at
-80°C until the assay. Written informed consent to tumor
tissue collection was obtained by each patient according
to the research protocol approved by the local ethical
committee.

Samples from human EOC tissues

Chemoinvasion assays were carried out using
modified Boyden chamber consisting of transwell
membrane filter inserts with 8 μm size polycarbonate
membrane precoated with polymerized collagen placed in
a 24-well plate (BD Biosciences). The cells (5 × 105 cells)
were stimulated with serum-free RPMI, or RPMI containing
ET-1, added to the lower chamber. The cells were left to
migrate for 12 h at 37°C. Cells on the upper part of the
membrane were scraped and the migrated cells were fixed
in 3.7% PFA and stained with 0.4% Crystal Violet in 10%
ethanol. From every transwell, several images were taken
under a phase-contrast with Olympus Ix70 microscope
(Olympus Corporation, Japan) at 10x magnification and two
broad fields were considered for quantification.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical analysis of ovarian cancers
was performed on archival from 39 frozen tumors
collected from patient population above described.
Avidin-biotin indirect immunoperoxidase staining was
performed by using the polyclonal antibody anti-ETAR
(Abbott Laboratories, IL, USA). The avidin-biotin assays
were performed using the Vectastain Elite kit (Vector
Laboratories). Sections in which the incubation with
the primary Ab was substituted by isotype-matched
immunoglobulins were used as control. AEC was used
as chromogenic substrate and Mayer’s haematoxylin as
nuclear counterstain [8].

Tubule-like structure formation
The ability of tumor cells to form capillary-like
structure formation has been assessed on cells cultured on
Cultrex (basal membrane extract; Trevigen, MD, USA),
as previously described [32]. Images were analyzed with
ImageJ v.1.34s (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) for determining
the length of the tubes and the number of intersections.
Representative images were captured with Olympus Ix70
microscope at 20x magnification.

ELISA

Bioinformatic analysis

Cells were plated at 4 × 105 per 60 mm dish and
transfected for 48h with mimic-miR control or mimicmiR-30a in serum-free medium. Then, cells were treated
or not with ET-1 for 24h. The VEGF protein levels in the
cell-conditioned medium were determined in triplicate by
ELISA using the Quantikine human VEGF immunoassay
kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The
sensitivity of the assay is less than 5.0 pg/ml.

Normalized miRNA and gene expression were
obtained from TCGA of HG-SOC. Data from different
platforms were interrogated (Agilent, RNAseqv2
and Illumina miRNA-Seq). All the expression value
differences between subgroups of samples were evaluated
applying unpaired t-test and permutation test. A false
discovery rate procedure [44] was also included for
multiple comparisons. Pearson’s correlation coefficient
and Spearman coefficient were calculated between miRNA
and gene target expression. Survival and progression free
survival were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method [45] and

of the distance between curves [46]. The impact of clinical
variables on the survival curves was investigated by a
multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model
[47]. Subgroup of samples in survival analyses were
individuated basing on the z-scores of the signal, and
considering as the most separate subgroups of samples
those with absolute z-score higher than 1.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test (unpaired, two-tailed) was used
for comparing statistical differences. Differences were
considered statistically significant when p<0.05. The time
course of tumor growth was compared across the groups
using two-way ANOVA, with group and time as variables.
The χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test for proportion were
used to analyze the distribution of clinical-pathological
variables according to different subgroups. PFS was
calculated from the date of surgery to the date of relapse or
the date of the last follow-up. Medians and life tables were
computed using the product limit estimate by Kaplan–
Meier method. Statistical analysis was carried out using
SPSS (SPSS II, SPSS Inc., IL, USA), SOLO (BMDP
Statistical Software, CA, USA) and MATLAB (The
MathWorks, MA, USA) software. The Mann-Whitney’s U
test was used to analyze differences in miRNA expression
levels.
