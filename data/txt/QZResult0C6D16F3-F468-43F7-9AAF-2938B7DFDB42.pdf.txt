BACKGROUND: Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are noncoding genomic sequences that completely identical among human, mouse,
and rat species and harbor critical biologic functions. The authors hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within
UCEs are associated with clinical outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: Forty-eight SNPs within UCEs were
genotyped in 662 patients with stage I through III CRC. The associations between genotypes and recurrence and survival were analyzed in patients with stage II or III CRC who received fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy using a training and validation
design. The training set included 115 patients with stage II disease and 170 patients with stage III disease, and the validation set
included 88 patients with stage II disease and 112 patients with stage III disease. RESULTS: Eight SNPs were associated with clinical
outcomes stratified by disease stage. In particular, for patients with stage II CRC who had at least 1 variant allele of reference SNP
sequence 7849 (rs7849), a consistent association with increased recurrence risk was observed in the training set (hazard ratio [HR],
2.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-5.52), in the replication set (HR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.42-9.64), and in a meta-analysis (HR, 2.89;
95% CI, 1.54-5.41). Several other SNPs were significant in the training set but not in the validation set. These included rs2421099,
rs16983007, and rs10211390 for recurrence and rs6590611 for survival in patients with stage II disease; and SNPs rs6124509 and
rs11195893 for recurrence in patients with stage III disease. In addition, a significant cumulative effect was observed of multiple risk
genotypes and potential gene-gene interactions on recurrence risk. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study
to evaluate the association between SNPs within UCEs and clinical outcome in patients with CRC. The results suggested that SNPs
within UCEs may be valuable prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced CRC who receive 5-fluorouracil–based chemoC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Surgery is the primary treatment modality with curative intent for patients with localized colorectal cancer (CRC). However, approximately 50% of patients will develop recurrent or metastatic disease after undergoing radical resection.1
Administration of 5-fluorouracil (FU) may be considered in patients who have high-risk, stage II and III disease according
to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (version 6.0). Unfortunately, 40% to
50% of patients will not experience beneficial effects and will suffer from treatment-related toxicities.2 Recent studies have
demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can provide information for personalized chemotherapy.3
It has been estimated that there are perhaps 50,000 to 250,000 SNPs that confer a biologic effect, most of which are
distributed in and around the 30,000 genes.4 Therefore, we believed it would be advantageous to evaluate SNPs that are
more likely to be functional and to have a bearing in CRC recurrence.
Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are 200-base pair (bp) to 779-bp, absolutely conserved, noncoding sequences that
have 100% sequence identity among orthologous genomic regions of the human, mouse, and rat species.5 Recent studies
suggest that UCEs frequently are located at fragile sites and genomic regions involved in cancers6 and have important
functions in vertebrate genomes, such as serving as long-range enhancers of flanking genes7 and regulating splicing,8 epigenetic modifications,9 and transcriptional coactivation.10 Alleles derived from SNPs within conserved regions are rarer

than new alleles in nonconserved regions (P ¼ 3 
1018).11 The variants in these regions have been subjected to extreme evolutionary pressure and are conserved
in humans over long evolutionary periods, suggesting that
the few common SNPs within UCEs may harbor critical
biologic functions.12 Thus, these SNPs may be excellent
tools for studying cancer risk, treatment efficacy, and
patient prognosis. However, to our knowledge, only 1
study has been published that analyzed the association
between genetic polymorphisms within UCEs and cancer
risk, revealing the potential impact of 6 SNPs on familial
breast cancer risk.13 However, another study demonstrated that UCEs have distinct expression signatures in
CRC, and inhibiting overexpressed UCEs induced apoptosis,6 suggesting potential links between UCEs and
prognosis and treatment response in patients with CRC.
Therefore, we hypothesize that SNPs within UCEs
modulate the clinical outcomes of patients with CRC.
To test this hypothesis, we selected 48 potentially functional SNPs within UCEs and systematically evaluated
their individual and joint associations with the clinical outcomes of patients with locally advanced CRC
patients who received adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based
chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Epidemiologic Data

Six hundred sixty-two patients with histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled at The
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MD
Anderson) between March 1995 and May 2008. All
patients were diagnosed with stage I through III disease
according to the AJCC TNM classification (version 6.0),
and they all underwent radical surgery. There were no
recruitment restrictions on age, sex, ethnicity, or cancer
stage. Of all 662 patients, 435 patients had their disease
diagnosed within 1 year before recruitment, and these
patients were analyzed as the training set in this study.
The remaining 227 patients had a longer history (>1
year) of CRC before their referral to MD Anderson and
were used as the validation set. Each patient signed an
informed consent form and donated a 10-mL to 20-mL
peripheral blood sample for the isolation of DNA.
Epidemiologic data were collected using a structured
questionnaire, including questions about demographic
characteristics, smoking history, alcohol consumption,
medical history, and family history of cancer. Clinical and
follow-up data, including date of diagnosis, performance
status, clinical stage, tumor location, histologic grade, primary surgery, pathologic stage, chemotherapy, chemoCancer

were abstracted from the patients’ medical records. Information on vital status was obtained from the medical
records and from the Social Security Death Index. The
study was approved by Institutional Review Board of MD
Anderson.
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
Selection and Genotyping

Bejerano et al discovered 481 UCEs using a bioinformatic
comparison of the mouse, rat, and human genomes.14 All
ultraconserved sequences that were used in the current study
are available in their report (available at: http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/jill/ultra.html [accessed December 10, 2010])14 and
from the UCbase and miRfunc database (available at: http://
microrna.osu.edu/UCbase4 [accessed December 10,
2010]).15 For each UCE, we first selected haplotype-tagging
SNPs based on data from the International HapMap Project
(available at: http://www.hapmap.org [accessed January 2,
2012]), and we obtained a list of 141 SNPs. After filtering
the SNPs with the LD Select program (available at: http://
droog.gs.washington.edu/ldSelect.html [accessed January 2,
2010]) and the University of California, San Francisco
Golden Path Gene Sorter program (available at: http://
genome.ucsc.edu [accessed January 2, 2012]), we retained
54 SNPs on the basis of a linkage disequilibrium r2 threshold
of 0.8 and a minor allele frequency >0.05 in Caucasians.
The 54 SNPs were then submitted to Illumina (San Diego,
Calif) technical support, and those with low Illumina quality
design scores (<0.6) were excluded. Table 1 lists the 48
SNPs that we selected for genotyping in this study.
DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood samples using a QIAampDNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). SNP genotyping was conducted using an
Illumina VeraCode GoldenGate Assay kit. The BeadXpress Reader was used for microbead code identification
and fluorescent signal detection. Genotype clustering and
calling were performed using Illumina GenomeStudio
software. Ten duplicate DNA samples exhibited 100%
concordance. The mean call rate for the SNP array was
99.9%. One SNP, reference SNP sequence 4412572
(rs4412572) in chromosome 1 open reading frame 10
(C1orf110), failed in all samples because of low signals
and, thus, was discarded from further analysis.
Statistical Analysis

Chi-square tests were used to assess differences in the distributions of categorical variables, and Student t tests were
used to evaluate continuous variables. A Cox proportional
hazards model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs)
and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for multivariate

survival analyses, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking
status, and histologic grade. For each SNP, we tested 3
different genetic models: specifically, a dominant model,
a recessive model, and an additive model. The model with
the most significant P value was considered the best-fitting model. Fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analyses were used to calculate the pooled HRs. The Cochrane
Q statistics test was used to assess heterogeneity between
different data sets. When the Q test was significant, a random-effects model was used to accommodate the diversity
in the magnitude of treatment effects. Otherwise, the
pooled HR was estimated using the random-effects
model. The associations between genotype and survival
time were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and
were analyzed using the log-rank test. We also evaluated
the combined effects of the SNPs according to the number of genotypes identified from the main-effects analysis
of single SNPs. Higher order gene-gene interactions were
evaluated using survival-tree analysis, as implemented in
the STREE program (available at: http://masal.med.yale.edu/stree/ [accessed February 14, 2012]), which uses recursive partitioning to identify subgroups of individuals
with similar risk. All statistical analyses were performed
using STATA software (version 10; STATA Corporation,
College Station, Tex). All P values were 2-sided, and a P
value < .05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients
are presented in Table 2. Of the 435 patients in the training set, 352 (80.9%) were Caucasian, and 263 (60.5%)
were men. There were 61 patients with stage I disease,
171 patients with stage II disease, and 203 patients with
stage III disease. All patients underwent primary surgery
with curative intent. Of these 435 patients, we obtained
genotype data from a total of 285 patients (66%) who had
received fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, including 115 patients with stage II disease and 170 patients
with stage III disease. During the median follow-up of
45.1 months, there were 65 deaths and 93 recurrences.
Sex, race, smoking pack-years, tumor location, and histologic grade were not associated significantly with clinical
outcomes. AJCC stage was associated significantly with
both recurrence (P ¼ .005) and survival (P ¼ .02), and
age was correlated with survival (P ¼ .01).
Among the 227 patients in the validation set, 200
patients (88%) had received fluoropyrimidine-based
chemotherapy, including 88 patients with stage II disease
and 112 patients with stage III disease. Overall, there were
Cancer

December 15, 2012

124 deaths and 211 recurrences during the median
follow-up of 57.5 months. These patients were diagnosed
outside of MD Anderson at least 1 year before they
presenting to MD Anderson for treatment because of
potential tumor recurrence or progression; therefore, their
recurrence and death rates were higher than those for
newly diagnosed patients (Table 2).
Individual Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
and Clinical Outcomes

We assessed the association of each individual SNP with
disease recurrence and death using a multivariate Cox
model, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status,
and histologic grade. We identified eight genetic loci that
were associated with the clinical outcomes of patients who
received fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy stratified
by stage (Table 3). Next, we evaluated the associations
between genotype and clinical outcomes after fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy in patients with stage II and
III disease. We did not analyze the patients with stage I
disease, who typically undergo surgery alone and who
have an excellent prognosis, and there were very few recurrence or death events in our training set. Among the
patients with stage II disease who received fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (N ¼ 115), those with the
homozygous variant and heterozygous genotypes of
rs7849 had an increased risk of recurrence (HR, 2.39;
95% CI, 1.04-5.52; P ¼ .04) and a decrease in median recurrence-free survival (log-rank P ¼ .03) compared with
those who had the wild-type genotype. This association
was confirmed in the replication set (HR, 3.70; 95% CI,
1.42-9.64; P ¼ .007) and in the meta-analysis (HR, 2.89;
95% CI, 1.54-5.41; P ¼ .001). For other SNPs that were
significant in the training set, patients who carried a
homozygous variant genotype of rs10211390 had a significantly increased risk of recurrence (HR, 2.79; 95% CI,
1.16-6.71; P ¼ .02) and shorter median recurrence-free
survival (log-rank P ¼ .03) compared with those who had
the wild-type and heterozygous genotypes. A significant
increase in the risk of recurrence also was observed for
patients who had the homozygous variant and the heterozygous genotypes of rs2421099 (HR, 2.44; 95% CI,
1.08-5.51; P ¼ .03) and rs16983007 (HR, 2.81; 95% CI,
1.02-7.70; P ¼ .04). Moreover, patients who carried at
least 1 variant allele of rs16983007 had a significantly
shorter recurrence-free survival than those who had the
wild-type genotype (log-rank P ¼ .03). The variant alleles
for rs6590611 were associated with an increased risk of
dying in a dose-dependent manner (per-allele HR, 2.92;
95% CI, 1.22-7.02).

Original Article

For patients with stage III disease who received fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (N ¼ 170), a significantly
decreased risk of recurrence was observed for those with
the homozygous variant and heterozygous genotypes of
rs6124509 (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.16-0.91; P ¼ .03) and
rs11195893 (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.91; P ¼ .04),
whereas the homozygous variant genotype for
rs10211390 was associated with an increased risk of recurrence (HR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.12-6.50; P ¼ .03). In addition, patients who carried the homozygous variant
genotype of rs10211390 had a shorter recurrence-free
interval than those who carried the wild-type and heterozygous genotype (log-rank P ¼ .007). Patients who carried the homozygous variant genotype of rs9942838 also
were at an increased risk of death (HR, 3.23; 95% CI,
1.17-8.92; P ¼ .02). These SNPs in patients who had
stage III disease were not validated in the replication set.
Cumulative Effects of Unfavorable Genotypes
on Clinical Outcome

We defined those genotypes that were associated with
increased risks of disease recurrence or death as unfavorable genotypes. Next, we asked whether combining the
unfavorable genotypes would have an additive effect on
the clinical outcomes of patients who had received fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. We performed a jointeffect analysis using 4 SNPs that were associated significantly with recurrence risk in patients with stage II disease.
There was a significant dose-response trend toward an
increased risk of CRC recurrence with increasing number
of unfavorable genotypes. Compared with the low-risk
group (0-1 unfavorable genotypes), the medium-risk
group (2 unfavorable genotypes) and the high-risk group
(3-4 unfavorable genotypes) had a 4.36 times (95% CI,
1.66-11.47) and 9.67 times (95% CI, 2.99-31.25) higher
risk of recurrence, respectively (P for trend ¼ 1.78 
105). The median recurrence-free survival was >143.3
months, 30.2 months, and 16.8 months for patients in
the low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk groups, respectively (log-rank P ¼ 8.14  106) (Fig. 1A).
We also evaluated the combined effects of the 3
SNPs that were associated significantly with disease recurrence in patients with stage III disease. Compared with
the reference group (those with 0-1 unfavorable genotypes), the HRs for individuals with 2 and 3 unfavorable
genotypes were 3.21 (95% CI, 1.34-7.74) and 6.98 (95%
CI, 2.12-22.97), respectively (Ptrend ¼ .001). Cumulative
effect analysis also revealed a significant dose-dependent
effect on median recurrence-free survival (log-rank P ¼
.001) (Fig. 1B).

Single Nucleotide Polymorphism-Single
Nucleotide Polymorphism Interactions and
Clinical Outcomes

We next used survival tree analysis to further evaluate the
potential interactions among the SNPs that were associated significantly with recurrence in patients who had
stage II and III disease (Fig. 2A). For those with stage II
disease, the tree structure resulted in 4 terminal nodes,
ranging from low to high recurrence risk. The initial split
was rs2421099, suggesting its value as a prognostic marker
for patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy. When
using terminal lymph node A as the reference group
(wild-type genotypes of rs2421099 and rs16983007), the
HR was 1.46 (95% CI, 0.46-4.68) for terminal lymph
node B (heterozygous and homozygous variant genotypes
of rs2421099 and wild-type genotypes of rs7849), 3.18
(95% CI, 0.90-11.19) for terminal lymph node C (wildtype genotype of rs2421099 and heterozygous and homozygous variant genotypes of rs16983007), and 6.27 (95%
CI, 2.25-17.41) for terminal lymph node D (heterozygous and homozygous variant genotypes of rs2421099

and rs7849) (Ptrend ¼ .0004). The increase in recurrence
risk resulted in a decrease in median recurrence-free survival for subgroups corresponding to terminal nodes A, B,
C, and D (log-rank P ¼ 6.21  105) (Fig. 2B).
We performed a similar analysis for patients with
stage III disease. The analysis resulted in 3 terminal nodes,
with rs10221390 as the initial split. When using terminal
lymph node 1 (those with the wild-type and heterozygous
genotypes of rs10211390 and the heterozygous and
homozygous variant genotypes of rs6124509) as the reference group, the HRs for terminal lymph node 2 (those
with the wild-type and heterozygous genotypes of
rs10211390 and the wild-type genotype of rs6124509)
and terminal lymph node 3 (those with the homozygous
variant genotypes of rs10211390) were 3.75 (95% CI,
1.23-11.50) and 7.96 (95% CI, 2.07-30.65), respectively

DISCUSSION
We have completed a comprehensive study to identify
polymorphisms within UCEs that influence the clinical
outcomes of patients with locally advanced CRC who
received adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.
We identified 8 genetic loci that are most likely to have an
impact on the sensitivity to fluoropyrimidine agents.
These SNPs can be used as prognostic biomarkers to assist
in stratifying patients for fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. For patients with stage II disease, rs7849 consistently was associated with disease recurrence in the
training set, validation set, and meta-analysis. Moreover,
we demonstrated that the genotype-drug interaction was
6195

much more pronounced when multiple gene variants
were considered in combination.
Currently, chemotherapy is considered for patients
with AJCC high-risk stage II and stage III disease. Thus, it
is very important to define individual risk to determine
who may or may not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. In this study, rs10211390 allowed us to identify the
patients with stage II and III disease who had an increased
risk of recurrence after fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. The SNP rs10211390 affects the nonexonic element uc.54. It has been demonstrated that this category of
nonexonic elements acts as a long-range enhancer to control flanking gene expression.16,17 Such long-range
enhancers can act at distances >2630 kilo bases (kb) from
their target genes.16 An in vivo analysis confirmed that
45% of human conserved noncoding sequences, including uc.54, function as tissue-specific enhancers of gene
expression.7,18 The nearest gene downstream of
rs10211390 is Fanconi anemia, complementation group
L (FANCL), 1 of 13 known Fanconi anemia genes that are
705 kb from rs10211390. FANCL recently was identified
as the putative catalytic E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit of the
Fanconi anemia core complex, which monoubiquitinates
FANCD2 to allow proper repair of exogenous DNA damage.19,20 Moreover, cross-links between the Fanconi anemia core complex and the breast cancer susceptibility gene
BRCA2 appear to be involved with multiple DNA repair
mechanisms.21 Thus, the FANC protein network has an
important role in promoting chromosomal instability and
tumor development and determining the sensitivity of
cancer cells to chemotherapy.22,23 Recently, Zhang et al
reported that a splice variant of FANCL resulted in
decreased FANCL expression, which provided lung cancer
cells with a growth advantage.22 Nevertheless, the biologic
mechanisms that underlie the associations of rs10211390
with cancer and the function of uc.54 remain unclear and
need further research.
The receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy by all patients
with stage II disease remains controversial. Our results
suggest that individual outcomes after fluoropyrimidine
treatment can be determined based on the genotypes of
rs7849 and rs6590611. Notably, rs7849 was associated
consistently with an increased recurrence risk in both the
validation set and the combined set. The rs7849 SNP is
located in uc.298, which is 1 of 12 paralogous UCE sets.
The finding that paralogous sets have changed minimally
in the past 300 million years suggests that they have crucial functions. The nearest gene upstream of rs7849 is stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, a critical mediator of fatty acid
synthesis. It has been demonstrated that the rare allele of
6196

rs7849 has an effect on body mass index, waist circumference, and insulin sensitivity, suggesting its potential physiologic significance. Recently, Luyimbaz et al linked this
cell fat metabolism gene to the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) oncogenic cell signaling pathway.24 The
mTOR pathway functions through its effectors to mediate protein synthesis and cell cycle progression, and it is
involved in multiple anticancer drug resistance. The SNP
rs6590611 affects uc.334, which was included in the neurotrimin (HNT) intron, a cell adhesion molecule family
member. The intronic polymorphisms of HNT were
identified as possible susceptibility loci for immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephritis and Alzheimer disease.25,26 However, to our knowledge, no study has reported the genetic
effects of HNT polymorphisms on CRC treatment
response. It is noteworthy that HNT expression has been
associated with disease recurrence in patients with stage I
and II disease after surgery.27 Our results further suggest
that these patients may be good candidates for chemotherapy but may not benefit from the fluoropyrimidine
regimen.
Although a pooled analysis of fluoropyrimidinebased adjuvant therapy trials demonstrated a beneficial
treatment effect in patients with stage III disease,.28 we
observed that patients who had minor alleles of
rs9942838 had poorer survival. The rs9942838 genotype
is located in the intron of early B-cell factor 2 (EBF2).
The EBF family is a group of DNA-binding transcription
factors with a basic helix-loop-helix domain.29 Several
studies have indicated that EBF inactivation because of
genomic deletion, epigenetic silencing, or somatic point
mutations exists in several types of cancer, including leukemia, glioblastoma, and pancreatic cancer, supporting
the emerging roles of the EBF family in tumor suppression.30-32 Another study demonstrated that silencing
EBF2 led to a reduced resistance to apoptosis in chemotherapy-naı̈ve, tumor-derived cell populations from
patients diagnosed with sporadic osteosarcoma.33 However, to our knowledge, EBF2 has not been investigated
within the context of a fluoropyrimidine regimen.
To enhance the identification of patients with CRC
who would benefit from the fluoropyrimidine regimen,
we completed a combined-effects analysis of unfavorable
genotypes within the identified prognostic loci. A clear
and significant trend was evident for increased risk with
an increasing number of unfavorable genotypes. These
results suggest that the cumulative influence of multiple
genetic variants within the UCEs can further enhance the
separation of patients based on clinical outcome. Complex interactions between the SNPs could determine the

functional outcome more than the independent main
effects of any 1 susceptibility gene. We also performed an
exploratory analysis of the SNP-SNP interactions and
identified subgroups of patients with dramatically different recurrence-free survival after fluoropyrimidine treatment. However, statistical modeling of an interaction
does not amount to a true biologic interaction, and these
results should be interpreted with caution.
The current study has several strengths. First, we
reviewed and analyzed all variations within 481 UCEs
and reported systematic SNPs within the UCEs. Second,
this is the first study to date that was designed specifically
to identify the genetic effects of SNPs within UCEs in
patients with locally advanced CRC and their treatment
outcomes after adjuvant therapy. In addition, we have
comprehensive epidemiologic and clinical data for all
patients at our institution with locally advanced CRC
who had a prolonged period of surveillance. The main limitation of this study is that the replication set was not
comprised of newly diagnosed patients but of those
patients who came to MD Anderson mainly because of
potential recurrence or disease progression. Therefore,
there was an over-representation of recurrence and progression among patients in the replication set. The reason
for our current means of splitting the training and replication sets was to keep the training set as clean as possible to
identify promising and more reliable candidate SNPs for
further validations by us and other investigators in the
field. However, the relative small and heterozygous population in the replication set may result in false-negative
results. Another weakness was that, although the overall
patient cohort was large, we stratified our analysis by stage
and treatment to limit the confounding of stage and treatment on recurrence or survival, which caused smaller
numbers in the analyses and limited our power to detect
additional significant associations. Only 1 SNP, rs7849,
was validated in our replication set. Other SNPs were not
significant in the replication set, although several of them
exhibited a consistent trend and remained significant in
pooled analyses (eg, rs10211390 for recurrence in both
stage II and stage III patients and rs6590611 for survival
in stage II patients). In addition, given the multiple comparison issue, there is a possibility that the significant
results may have been caused by chance. Future validations with patient populations comparable to our training
set and larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our
results and validate more significant SNPs.
In conclusion, we have identified genetic variations
within UCEs as prognostic markers in patients with
locally advanced CRC who received fluoropyrimidineCancer

based adjuvant chemotherapy. The validation and incorporation of the identified SNPs and interactions with the
clinical variables may allow clinicians to stratify patients
for optimal adjuvant chemotherapy to achieve a step
forward in personalized cancer care.
