ABSTRACT:
Although p53 is found mutated in almost 50% of all cancers, p53 mutations in
leukaemia are relatively rare. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells employ other
strategies to inactivate their wild type p53 (WTp53), like the overexpression of the
p53 negative regulators Mdm2 and Mdm4. As such, AMLs are excellent candidates
for therapeutics involving the reactivation of their WTp53 to restrict and destroy
cancer cells, and the Mdm2 antagonist nutlin-3 is one such promising agent. Using
AML cell lines with WTp53, we identified stable and high levels of p53 in the OCI/
AML-2 cell lines. We demonstrate that this nutlin-3 sensitive cell line overexpressed
Mdm4 to sequester, stabilise and inhibit p53 in the cytoplasm. We also show that
elevated Mdm4 competed with Mdm2-p53 interaction and therefore extended p53
half-life while preventing p53 transcriptional activity. Our results provide biochemical
evidence on the dynamics of the p53-Mdm2-Mdm4 interactions in affecting p53
levels and activity, and unlike previously reported findings derived from genetically
manipulated systems, AML cells with naturally high levels of Mdm4 remain sensitive
to nutlin treatment.
Key Points
Endogenously high levels of Mdm4 inhibit and sequester p53 in AML.
High levels of Mdm4 do not block function of Mdm2 inhibitors in AML.

INTRODUCTION

p53 transactivation domain via its N-terminal domain
[5, 6]. Also, unlike Mdm2, Mdm4 expression levels are
not dependent on p53, though Mdm2 targets Mdm4 and
itself for proteasomal degradation [7]. Both Mdm2 and
Mdm4 are mutually dependent on each other to bring
about effective downregulation of p53 [8]. Mdm4 forms
heterodimers with Mdm2 through their RING domains,
and this stimulates the Mdm2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity,
heightening polyubiquitination of p53 [9].
Although more than 50% of solid tumours carry
TP53 mutations, TP53 mutations are rare in leukaemias
[10]. Instead, WTp53 in leukaemias is frequently
inactivated through abnormalities in Mdm2, and as much
as 50% of leukaemias are found to overexpress Mdm2
[11]. This block in p53 signalling contributes greatly to
the resistance of leukaemic cells towards apoptosis. An
effective therapeutic strategy is the restoration of WTp53
function, through the disruption of its interaction with

The guardian of the genome TP53 codes for a
transcription factor central in responding to a myriad of
stress stimuli whose activation results in the induction
of several genes to bring about DNA repair, metabolic
changes, anti-oxidant responses, cell cycle arrest,
apoptosis or senescence [1]. Cancers with aberrations in
p53 have either mutated p53, or have dysfunctional p53
regulation. The latter is commonly achieved through
Mdm2, which is responsible for nuclear export of p53
[2] and targeting p53 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
degradation [3]. Recent evidence implicates Mdm4, an
Mdm2 homologue, in the inactivation and degradation
of p53 [4]. Despite being highly homologous with Mdm2
and having a C-terminal RING domain, Mdm4 does not
have any E3 ligase activity. It is, however, capable in
suppressing p53 transcriptional activity by binding the

its negative regulators. The use of nutlin-3, the selective
and potent inhibitor of the p53-Mdm2 interaction, in
the treatment of WTp53 positive leukaemia is therefore
potentially very rewarding [12, 13].
Here, we examined an AML cell line, OCI/AML2, which harbours high basal levels of WTp53. Using
this AML line as a model, we sought to understand the
mechanics governing the constant maintenance of a
large pool of WTp53 without spontaneously undergoing
cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, and demonstrate that the
overexpression of Mdm4 is responsible for modulating
p53 localisation, half-life and activity. Moreover, unlike
previously reported observations, nutlin response is not
necessarily limited by the overexpression of Mdm4 in
AML cells.

AML2 cells are sensitive to nutlin-3, despite high
basal levels of WTp53
We looked into the effects of nutlin-3 on AML
cells by testing the sensitivities of three AML cell
lines OCI/AML-2 (AML2), OCI/AML-3 (AML3) and
MOLM13. All three cell lines were established from the
peripheral blood of AML patients and are wild type for
p53. A notable difference is that AML3 cells harbour the
cytoplasmic mutant NPM, while AML2 and MOLM13
cells are wild type for NPM [15, 16]. AML2 and AML3

and 48 hours). Thus despite having WTp53, the three cell
lines responded differently to nutlin-3 treatment.
In order to understand this discrepancy, we examined
the effect of nutlin-3 on p53 and p53-regulated expression.
Flow cytometry of p53 staining in the three AML cell lines
showed a higher level of p53 in untreated AML2 cells,
with p53 levels increasing even higher after nutlin-3
exposure (Figure 1B, 1C). In contrast, AML3 and MOLM13 displayed low basal levels of p53, only increasing upon
nutlin-3 induction. It is noted that in AML2 and AML3
induction by nutlin-3 results in ubiquitinated species of
p53, concordant with previously reported findings [18].
Interestingly, while high levels of WTp53 are normally
associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, the high

cells also carry DNMT3A mutations [17]. Apoptosis was
assayed by staining nutlin-3 treated cells with Annexin
V and analysing them using flow cytometry (Figure 1A).
MOLM13 cells were extremely sensitive to nutlin-3, with
almost all cells (92.3% and 99.2% after 24 and 48 hours)
undergoing apoptosis with treatment of 10µM nutlin-3.
AML2 cells were less sensitive compared to MOLM13
cells, exhibiting significant cell death after treatment with
10µM nutlin-3 (45.8% and 72.6% after 24 and 48 hours).
However, AML3 cells showed resistance towards nutlin-3,
exhibiting only a relatively small percentage of apoptotic
cells at 10µM nutlin-3 (11.3% and 21.9% after 24 and
48 hours), a rate lower than that achieved in AML2 cells
treated with only 2µM nutlin-3 (16.5% and 25.3% after 24

basal levels of p53 observed in untreated AML2 cells did
not result in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
To ensure that the p53 in these AML cell lines
was wild type and functional, the three cell lines were
treated with nutlin-3 and Mdm2 protein upregulation, an
indication of p53 activity, was observed (Figure 1C). In
addition, p53-regulated genes like Mdm2, p21 and NOXA
were upregulated at the RNA level in response to nutlin-3
induction in AML2 and AML3 cells (Figure 1D). The
abnormal level and activity of p53 in AML2 cells could
be a result of aberrations in p53 negative regulators, chief
among them are Mdm2 and Mdm4. Sequencing of cDNA
from AML2 cells revealed that there were no mutations
in either Mdm2 or Mdm4 (data not shown). To look for
other means of Mdm2 deregulation, we examined the
effect of ATM kinase on Mdm2, where ATM kinasemediated phosphorylation of S395 inhibits the Mdm2mediated degradation of p53 [19]. We used the ATM

inhibitor (ATMi) KU-55933 (Calbiochem, USA) to see
if the high level of p53 is due to ATM kinase activity.
Although treatment with the ATMi downregulated p53
levels in AML3 cells, the p53 levels in AML2 were largely
unchanged (Figure S1).
Similarly, we examined another critical regulator
of Mdm2, the tumour suppressor ARF. ARF binds to the
acidic region of Mdm2 and inhibits p53 ubiquitination
and degradation [20]. However, there are no significant
differences in ARF expression between AML2 and AML3,
indicating that ARF is probably not responsible for the
accumulation of p53 (Figure S1). In addition, we looked
into a few of the ubiquitin specific proteases (USPs) that
are known to affect p53. USP5 deubiquitinates p53 [21],
while USP2a acts on Mdm2 [22], and differences in the
levels of the two proteases can affect p53 levels. There
were no significant differences in the levels of these two
USPs between AML2 and AML3 cells, indicating that
they are not involved in mediating p53 accumulation
(Figure S1).
Mdm2 levels and response in AML2 cells were
similar to that seen in AML3 cells, albeit at a lower level
(Figure 1C). However, unlike Mdm2, the Mdm4 levels
in AML2 cells were much greater than in AML3 cells,

and remained high upon nutlin treatment (Figure 1C).
Comparatively, the Mdm4 levels in AML3 were lower and
dropped rapidly upon drug treatment. (Figure 1C). Given
that Mdm4 is known to bind and sequester p53 [23], and
that the overexpression of Mdm4 is exploited by several
cancers to deregulate p53 function [24-26], the high level
of Mdm4 is a likely candidate responsible for the high
basal p53 in AML2.

reinforced the observation of elevated Mdm4 in AML2
cells. β-actin was used as a loading control (Figure 2D).
A measure of p53 stability and Mdm2/Mdm4
activity can be observed by pre-treatment and withdrawal
of nutlin-3 [18]. CHX and MG132 were added to the
cells after nutlin-3 withdrawal to chart degradation and
accumulation. Cells treated with the Mdm2 antagonist
accumulate p53 and p53-responsive gene products rapidly,
and the withdrawal of nutlin-3 reverses the upregulation,
resulting in rapid degradation. Treatment with nutlin-3
resulted in massive upregulation of p53, but, unlike in
AML3, the p53 in AML2 was sustained at a high level
(Figure 2E). This observation was emphasised with the
use of CHX to inhibit protein synthesis, with p53 in AML3
diminishing rapidly, while the p53 in AML2 remained
high. The use of MG132 also showed that p53 in AML3
cells was highly ubiquitinated, exhibiting greater levels
of polyubiquitinated species of p53 compared to the p53
in AML2. This would explain the rapid loss of p53 in
AML3 cells, as polyubiquitinated p53 would be rapidly
degraded in proteasomes. Interestingly, the combination of
CHX and MG132 suggested that only newly synthesised

WTp53 in AML2 is stable but inactive at
physiological conditions
To understand the mechanism by which WTp53 in
AML2 cells are elevated at a basal level, we tracked the
amounts of p53, Mdm2 and Mdm4 present in both AML2
and AML3 cells at different intervals. The inhibitor of
translation, cycloheximide (CHX) and the proteasome
inhibitor MG132 were used to offer insights on the
half-life and ubiquitination of the proteins respectively.
Compared to AML3, the p53 in AML2 was not only
more abundant, but also exhibited a longer half-life,
evident after CHX treatment (Figure 2A). Further, there
was a greater amount of accumulation after proteasomal
inhibition, indicating that there was a higher basal level
of expression compared to AML3, where p53 hardly
accumulated. The combination of CHX and MG132
accurately showed the steady state level of p53 in the two
cell lines, potentially ruling out the involvement of other
non-proteasomal degradation pathways.
There were little differences between the two cell
lines in terms of Mdm2 levels and stability (Figure 2B). At
basal level, both AML2 and AML3 expressed low levels
of Mdm2, given the Mdm2-p53 negative feedback loop.
However, there were marked differences when comparing
Mdm4 in the two cell lines (Figure 2C). Although both
cell types expressed stable levels of Mdm4, the levels in
AML2 were significantly higher than that in AML3. This

Reduction of Mdm4 caused p53 reactivation in
AML2

p53 underwent ubiquitination. This implies that there
was a static pool of p53 in AML2 that was resistant to
degradation.
Mdm2 in both cell lines behaved as expected after
nutlin-3 withdrawal (Figure 2F). The half-lives of Mdm2
in both AML2 and AML3 were similar, and the level of
ubiquitination were comparable. However, the levels of
Mdm4 between the two cell lines were different, with
Mdm4 in AML3 being rapidly degraded (Figure 2G). On
the other hand, Mdm4 levels in AML2 remained steady
throughout the entire interval, even in the presence of
CHX and/or MG132. Figure 2H shows the β-actin loading
control.

To test the hypothesis that Mdm4 is responsible for
the accumulation and inactivation of p53 in AML2 cells,
siRNA against Mdm4 (siMdm4) was employed. Figure
5A demonstrates the successful knockdown of Mdm4
in AML2 and AML3 cells transfected with siMdm4,
compared to the control using a non-targeting siRNA
(siCtrl). Compared to AML3 cells, siMdm4-transfected
AML2 cells displayed a decrease in cell viability 24 hours
post-transfection, indicating that Mdm4 is required to
prevent cell death in AML2 (Figure 5B). This drop in cell
viability corresponded to an increase in PARP cleavage
(Figure 5A), implying caspase-mediated apoptosis. Put
together, the results suggest a reduction of the high levels
of Mdm4 brought about the prevention of p53 suppression
in AML2, leading to apoptotic signalling and cell death.
In order to ascertain that p53 was involved in
the loss in cell viability following Mdm4 knockdown,
siRNA against p53 (siP53) was co-transfected into
AML2 cells along with siMdm4. While siMdm4 resulted
in the loss of cell viability and decreased proliferation,
the concurrent knockdown of p53 abolished the effects
mediated by knocking down Mdm4 (Figure 6A and
6B). Closer examination of the molecular changes
following siMdm4 revealed that the reduction of Mdm4
resulted in an increase in p53 levels as well as p53
transcriptional activity, demonstrated by an increase in
the protein levels of the p53-transcribed genes mdm2,
p21, NOXA and PUMA (Figure 6C). This increase in
p53 activity was accompanied by the presence of PARP
and Lamin B cleavage, both of which indicate apoptosis.
These observations were abrogated with the concurrent
knockdown of p53, suggesting that p53 was involved
in mediating cell death induced by Mdm4 reduction.
Subcellular fractionation of AML2 cells indicated that
depletion of Mdm4 by siRNA resulted in the increase
in p53 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figure 6D),
suggesting that p53 could mediate apoptosis in both a
transcription dependent or independent manner. These
findings strongly suggest that Mdm4 is involved in
preventing p53 activation and that upon the removal of
Mdm4, p53 becomes active in causing cell death.

Stability of p53 is determined by ratio of p53Mdm2 to p53-Mdm4 interactions
In order to determine whether the stability of p53
in AML2 was conferred by sequestration by high levels
of Mdm4, we sought to quantify the interactions between
p53 and Mdm2, and p53 and Mdm4. An ELISA using
immobilised anti-p53 (Bp53 10.1) antibodies was used,
recognising and binding p53 at the C-terminus, away
from the Mdm2/Mdm4 binding site. Captured complexes
in cell lysates from AML2 or AML3 cells treated or
untreated with nutlin-3 were detected using a sandwich
assay. As expected, the amount of p53 captured in the
assay corresponded to the amount of p53 in each cell line,
with high basal levels of p53 in AML2 and low levels
in AML3, and both increased in response to nutlin-3
treatment (Figure 3A). The ELISA also showed that the
p53 in AML3 cells was mostly complexed to Mdm2
(Figure 3B), while the p53 in AML2 cells was mostly
bound to Mdm4 (Figure 3C). This suggested that while
p53 in AML3 had the propensity to be bound to Mdm2
and therefore subsequently degraded, p53 in AML2 was
bound to Mdm4 instead, and this interaction prevents p53
degradation as well as p53 activity.
To reaffirm the findings of a higher level of p53Mdm4 interaction in AML2, a proximity ligation in situ
assay (PLISA) for the interaction was performed (Figure
4). As each PLISA spot corresponds to an interaction
event, there was a greater amount of p53-Mdm4
interaction in AML2, with or without nutlin-3 treatment.
In contrast, the p53-Mdm4 interaction in AML3 was
exceedingly low, and only slightly increased in response to
nutlin-3 treatment. It is interesting to note that in AML2,
most of the interactions occur outside the nucleus in the
cytoplasm. This observation reinforces the hypothesis
that Mdm4 sequesters and inactivates p53 by localising
it in the cytoplasm, as observed by the overexpression of
nuclear localisation mutants of Mdm4 [23].

DISCUSSION
Cancers that retain WTp53 often carry mutations
in regulatory genes that dampen p53 activity, effectively
creating phenotypes similar to p53 mutations. Many of
these mutations affect the stability and degradation of
p53, governing the amount and/or localisation of p53
in the cancer cell. These mechanisms include Mdm2
overexpression [27], ARF ablation [28], loss of PTEN
expression [29], expression of HPV E6 protein in cervical

cancers [30], or p53 cytoplasmic sequestration [31]. Here,
we show that a leukaemia cell line, AML2, carries high
basal levels of WTp53, and an amplified level of Mdm4
effectively binds to and inhibits p53 activity.
High p53 levels in cells are frequently associated
with cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis, and it would be
seemingly paradoxical to observe high WTp53 levels in
actively dividing cancer cells. However, high WTp53
expression levels have been observed in melanomas [32]
and testicular cancers [33], and here, we report that a high
level of WTp53 is also detected in AML, as demonstrated
in the AML2 cell line.
Further investigation of the p53 in AML2 revealed
that it is mostly cytoplasmic and bound to Mdm4. While
Mdm4, together with Mdm2, is responsible for the
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of p53 [34],
Mdm4 overexpression was previously reported to inhibit
p53 activity by direct binding, sequestering the tumour
suppressor in the cytoplasm, outcompeting Mdm2-p53
interaction and protecting p53 against proteasomal
degradation [5, 23, 35, 36]. This coincides with the
observations reported here that p53 was kept inactive
in the cytoplasm at high levels by interactions with
Mdm4. Although high Mdm4 levels have been reported
in melanomas[26], retinoblastoma [25], head and neck
squamous cancers [37], the high levels of both p53 and
Mdm4 have not been described until now. In fact, Mdm4
has been reported to be amplified in a panel of leukemia
cell lines (Figure S2) [38]. Also, unlike in systems where
Mdm4 had been exogenously introduced [39-41], here
we demonstrate that endogenously high levels of Mdm4
can effectively inhibit p53 activity and sequester it in the
cytoplasm.
In the pulse chase experiments, it was observed
that only nascent p53 was ubiquitinated in AML2 cells
(Figure 5.6E). As p53 in AML2 was mostly bound to
Mdm4 but not Mdm2, the lack of p53 ubiquitination could
be due to Mdm4 out-competing Mdm2 for p53 binding,
preventing Mdm2 from ubiquitinating p53. This would
also explain the increased stability and longer half-life of
p53 observed in AML2 cells. Similarly, the high levels of
Mdm4 would also prevent Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination
and subsequent proteasomal degradation of Mdm4,
allowing the accumulation of Mdm4 in AML2 cells. These
observations highlight the importance of the stoichiometry
of p53, Mdm2 and Mdm4 in maintaining their stability
and degradation.
Unlike in model studies where Mdm4
overexpression blocked nutlin-induced apoptosis [39, 40],
the high levels of Mdm4 did not confer much resistance in
AML2 cells. AML2 cells, while being more sensitive than
AML3 cells, did not exhibit rapid cell death compared to
MOLM13 cells. It is speculated that nutlin-3 prevents the
degradation of newly-synthesised p53, thereby allowing
the accumulation of p53 beyond what can be sequestered
by Mdm4. Nonetheless, the loss of cell viability in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

response to the knockdown of Mdm4 indicated that
Mdm4 did indeed prevent cell death in AML2 cells. Since
the precarious balance of Mdm2 and Mdm4 determines
p53 stability and activity, it is feasible that disruption of
Mdm2-p53 interaction by nutlin-3, in a cell ‘addicted’
to Mdm4 as an oncogene, was sufficient to increase p53
levels beyond what can be sequestered by overexpressed
Mdm4, leading to apoptosis.
The knockdown of Mdm4 by siRNA in AML2 cells
resulted in cell death characterised by PARP cleavage. p53
nuclear accumulation was observed and p53-dependent
genes were upregulated, suggesting that the release of p53
from its inhibition by Mdm4 led to cell death in a p53
dependent manner. Canonically, p53-mediated apoptosis
requires the transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic
genes like PUMA, NOXA and Bax. However, recent
evidence implicate that the stress-induced cytoplasmic
and mitochondrial accumulation of p53 can lead to
the direct activation of Bax and/or Bak [42, 43]. These
pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family oligomerise
and form pores in the mitochondria outer membrane,
triggering the intrinsic apoptotic caspase cascade. This
p53-dependent role in apoptosis was found to be present
when p53 nuclear translocation was prevented [42] and
when transcription was inhibited [44], and the activation
of pro-apoptotic proteins by p53 was found to precede
p53-activated transcription [45]. Further investigation led
to the discovery that p53 can bind Bcl-2 [46] and BclxL [47], preventing their anti-apoptotic activities. The
findings of increased cytoplasmic p53 levels upon siMdm4
suggest the possibility of a transcription independent role
of p53 in mediating apoptosis in AML2 cells.
Anti-leukaemia chemotherapeutic drugs like AraC,
etoposide, daunorubicin and doxorubicin traditionally
target DNA replication because of the rapid proliferation
of leukaemia cells. However, these drugs also adversely
affect numerous other rapidly dividing cell types,
forming the basis of detrimental side effects. Treatment
of leukaemia therefore is a balance of destroying the
majority of leukaemic cells while killing as few normal
cells as possible. These drugs are also genotoxic in nature,
introducing the possibility of inducing further mutations
that potentially generate other cancers, or even result
in the induction of chemoresistance in the existing one.
In fact, a major cause of AML is the use of cytotoxic
drugs previously used to treat other forms of cancer. As
a specific inhibitor of Mdm2-p53 interaction, nutlin-3
offers advantages over traditional chemotherapeutic drugs
in that, at optimal doses, its apoptotic effect is selective
for tumour cells while normal cells undergo reversible cell
cycle arrest [48]. Moreover, since the mechanism of action
does not involve DNA intercalation or damage, nutlin-3 is
non-genotoxic [49]. Hence, the use of nutlin-3 in a WTp53
cancer like AML would be extremely suitable.
The differential response of AML cells to nutlin-3
demonstrates the need to understand the underlying causes

undergoing clinical trials, and in light of the data presented
here, cancers refractory to nutlin-treatment should not be
dismissed entirely without further investigation. Given
that there is evidence of Mdm4 overexpression in AML,
combinatorial treatments with Mdm2 and Mdm4 inhibitors
would allow lowered dosages and even fewer adverse
effects.

Quantitative real time PCR

Cell culture and siRNA transection

Total RNA was extracted from AML2 and AML3
cells with a Qiagen RNAeasy Kit. cDNA was obtained by
reverse transcription using random hexamers and 1µl (5%
of the reaction) was used as the template for subsequent
real time PCR with 2X iQ Supermix (Biorad) and 1µM
forward and reverse primers (Table 1). The reactions
were performed in triplicate in a 384-well format with
10µl reaction volume. The melt curve for each primer
set was verified to have a single distinct peak and gel
electrophoresis of the PCR products only produced one
clear band.

AML cell lines OCI/AML-2, OCI/AML-3 and
MOLM13 were cultured in Alpha Minimum Essential
Media supplemented with 20% foetal calf serum and
100U/ml penicillin and 100µg/ml streptomycin, as
previously described [14]. The Nucleofector system
(Amaxa; programme X-001) was used to transfect 2.5 x
106 cells with 1µM pooled non-targeting siRNA (siCtrl),
siRNA against Mdm4 (siMdm4) and/or siRNA against p53
(siP53) (Thermo Scientific). Cell viability and cell number
were assessed using the Adam automated cell counter
(Digital Bio).

For apoptosis assays, 2.5 x 105 cells were
resuspended in binding buffer (10mM HEPES pH 7.4,
140mM NaCl, 2.5mM CaCl2) with 1µl Annexin V-Cy5
(BioVision). After 15 minutes incubation at room
temperature, the cells were pelleted and resuspended
again in binding buffer for analysis. For immunostaining
assays, 2.5 x 105 cells were fixed and permeabilised in icecold 70% ethanol for 30 minutes at -20oC. The cells were
washed with PBS and stained with 1µg mouse anti-p53
(DO-1) or mouse isotype control antibody, washed thrice
with PBS and stained with 1µg goat anti-mouse Alexa488
(Invitrogen), and washed thrice again. Flow cytometry
analysis on single cells was performed with BD LSR II
(BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using
Flowing Software 2 (Turku Centre for Biotechnology).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
20µg/ml mouse anti-p53 (Bp53 10.1) was
immobilised onto high binding capacity polystyrene 96well plates (Corning) and incubated with lysates from 2
x 107 cells (lysis buffer: 50mM Tris Cl pH 8.0, 150mM
NaCl, 10mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 5mM NaF, 200µM
Na3VO4, 1mM dithiothreitol, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche)). After washing with PBS, protein complexes
were detected using HRP-conjugated mouse anti-Mdm2
(2A9), HRP-conjugated mouse anti-p53 (DO-1), or rabbit
anti-Mdm4 (Bethyl) with secondary swine anti-rabbit HRP
antibodies and TMB substrate (Bio-Rad). The reaction
was stopped with 1.0M H2SO4 and the absorbance at
450nm was measured using an EnVision Plate Reader
(Perkin Elmer).

Western blotting
Lysates were prepared by lysing cells in 95oC
SDS lysis buffer (20mM Tris Cl pH 8.0, 2% SDS, 10%
glycerol), and briefly sonicated to shear DNA. Equal
amounts of protein measured by BCA quantification
(Pierce), were loaded in SDS-PAGE gels and transferred
onto nitrocellulose with the iBlot system (Invitrogen).
The primary antibodies used were: mouse anti-p53
(DO-1; 1:5000), mouse anti-Mdm2 (2A9; 1:5000),

PLISA was performed using the Duolink In Situ Kit
(OLink Biosciences, Sweden) according to manufacturer’s
protocols. Cells smeared onto Polysine (Thermo Scientific)
glass slides were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in
PBS and permeabilised with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS,
blocked and incubated with 5 µg/ml of the following
antibodies: mouse anti-p53 (Bp53 10.1) and rabbit antiMdm4 (Bethyl), or mouse anti-Mdm2 (2A9) and rabbit
anti-p53 (CM-1). Images comprising 30 0.49µm-thick
z-stacks were obtained with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal
microscope with a 40X 1.3 NA objective.
