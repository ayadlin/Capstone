BACKGROUND: Evidence-based guidelines recommend routine surveillance, including office visits and testing, to detect new and
recurrent disease among survivors of breast and colorectal cancer. The extent to which surveillance practice is consistent with guideline recommendations or may vary by age is not known. METHODS: Cohorts of adult patients diagnosed with breast (n ¼ 6205) and
colorectal (n ¼ 2297) cancer between 2000 and 2008 and treated with curative intent in 4 geographically diverse managed care
environments were identified via tumor registries. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to describe time to initial and subsequent
receipt of surveillance services. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the relation between patient characteristics and receipt
of metastatic screening. RESULTS: Within 18 months of treatment, 87.2% of breast cancer survivors received recommended mammograms, with significantly higher rates noted for patients aged 50 years to 65 years. Among survivors of colorectal cancer, only 55.0%
received recommended colon examinations, with significantly lower rates for those aged  75 years. The majority of breast (64.7%)
and colorectal (73.3%) cancer survivors received nonrecommended metastatic disease testing. In patients with breast cancer, factors
associated with metastatic disease testing include white race (hazards ratio [HR], 1.13), comorbidities (HR, 1.17), and younger age (HR,
1.13; 1.15; 1.13 for age groups: <50, 50–64, and 65–74 respectively). In those with colorectal cancer, these factors included younger age
(HR, 1.31; 1.25 for age groups: <50 and 50–64 respectively) and comorbidities (HR, 1.10). CONCLUSIONS: Among an insured population, wide variation regarding the use of surveillance care was found by age and relative to guideline recommendations. Breast cancer
survivors were found to have high rates of both guideline-recommended recurrence testing and non–guideline-recommended metastatic testing. Only approximately 50% of colorectal cancer survivors received recommended tests but greater than 67% received

INTRODUCTION
In 2006, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended that cancer survivors receive ongoing surveillance care based
on a follow-up plan that is clearly and effectively explained.1 Evidence-based and consensus-based guidelines from
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN),2,3 the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO),4,5
and other specialty-oriented medical societies6-9 outline recommended schedules for ongoing surveillance care after
cancer treatment with curative intent. Although recommendations vary to some extent in terms of the type and timing of care, NCCN and ASCO guidelines for survivors of breast and colorectal cancer recommend a course that is
comprised of periodic physical examinations and screening for recurrent and metastatic disease via imaging and other
procedures.
To the best of our knowledge, relatively little is known regarding the quality of care delivered to cancer survivors.
Prior studies among survivors of breast and colorectal cancer have found deviations in surveillance care patterns relative to
evidence-based guidelines as well as variations in surveillance care use by patient sociodemographic characteristics, including race and income. However, such studies have been limited to survivors receiving care from 1 delivery organization10-16
or those enrolled in Medicare.17-21 As such, the care received by survivors who are aged  64 years is not well documented.
Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted since the IOM report was issued.
Using cohorts of breast and colorectal cancer survivors receiving care from 4 geographically diverse health maintenance organizations between 2000 and 2008, we evaluated the extent to which surveillance care use was consistent with
guideline recommendations. Of specific interest was the evaluation of the variability in surveillance care use by age at
diagnosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Setting

This study was conducted within 4 large, nonprofit, integrated health systems: Group Health Cooperative (Seattle, Wash), Health Alliance Plan/Henry Ford Health
System (Detroit, Mich), Kaiser Permanente Colorado
(Denver, Colo), and Kaiser Permanente Northwest (Portland, Ore). These plans are all members of the Cancer
Research Network (National Cancer Institute [NCI]
Cooperative Agreement No. U19 CA79689, Increasing
Effectiveness of Cancer Control Interventions), an initiative of the NCI designed to conduct research on cancer
prevention, early detection, treatment, long-term care,
surveillance, and cancer communication and dissemination and implementation research.
Data available from each organization’s tumor registry were used to identify patients aged  18 years who
were diagnosed between January 1, 2000 and December
31, 2008 with nonmetastatic breast (International Classification for Diseases for Oncology [ICD-O] codes C50.0C50.9) or colorectal (ICD-O codes C18.0-C18.9, C19.9,
C20.9, and C26.0) cancer. Patients eligible for study
inclusion were those continuously enrolled in the health
plan for the 1-year period preceding their date of cancer
diagnosis. Patients for whom no information regarding
stage of disease was available at the time of diagnosis were
excluded. Patients were also excluded if they had a previous diagnosis of invasive cancer, had distant metastases at
the time of diagnosis, or did not receive treatment with
curative intent (ie, surgery). The breast cancer cohort was
limited to females and excluded women who had undergone a bilateral mastectomy or 2 separate occurrences of a
unilateral mastectomy on different dates.
Sample patients were followed from an ‘‘index
date,’’ defined as 3 months after the last curative surgical
procedure, to the first of the following endpoints (‘‘end
date’’): death, tumor recurrence, diagnosis of a second primary tumor, health plan disenrollment 5 years after the
initial cancer diagnosis, or the end of the follow-up period
(December 31, 2008). Previous findings indicate that
altering assignment of the index date to exclude from consideration care received within the first 6 and 9 months
after surgical treatment (vs 3 months) does not alter results
or conclusions.13 Institutional Review Boards at each of
the 4 participating organizations approved all aspects of
the study protocol.
Data Sources and Measures

Automated electronic medical record (EMR) and claims
data linked to tumor registry data were accessed to obtain

patient demographic characteristics, date of cancer diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, and comorbidities within the
12-month period preceding diagnosis for each patient.
Patient demographics included age at diagnosis, gender,
and race (black, white, and other). Using the patient’s residential street address combined with 2000 US Census
tract data, we estimated the median household income for
each patient’s residential neighborhood. Clinical measures
included stage of disease at diagnosis, date of any cancer
recurrence(s) (defined as either local recurrence or the
occurrence of a second primary tumor) within 5 years of
the index date, and date of death. We measured recurrence(s) using the algorithm for measuring disease-free
survival described in Lamont et al.22 We summarized the
disease stages into 3 groups: in situ (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] general stage 0), localized
(AJCC general stage 1), and regional (AJCC general stages
2-5 [ie, regional by direct extension, lymph nodes, both,
or not otherwise specified]).
In addition to data available via the tumor registries,
EMR and claims data were reviewed between the patient’s
‘‘index date’’ and ‘‘end date.’’ For each organization, these
data sources contain comprehensive visit and procedure
information for any outpatient encounter to a physician,
laboratory, and imaging department. These data were
used to compute receipt of testing services and treatment
with surgery, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, radiation,
and combination therapies. The Deyo et al adaptation of
the Charlson comorbidity index and each of its component diagnostic subgroups was constructed using inpatient and outpatient diagnostic information available in
the 12-month period preceding diagnosis.23
Surveillance Care Receipt

The primary outcome of interest is the time to receipt of
recommended surveillance care. For both breast and colorectal cancer survivors, we observed 3 distinct types of
surveillance: physical examinations, testing for local recurrence, and testing for metastatic disease. Physical examinations performed by a primary care provider, medical
oncologist, radiation oncologist, general surgeon, or gastroenterologist (for patients with colorectal cancer only)
were included. For those with breast cancer, local recurrence tests included mammography, magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), and ultrasound, whereas for patients with
colorectal cancer, local recurrence tests included colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and barium enema. Procedures to
detect metastatic disease recurrence included chest radiograph; computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, or head; MRI of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, or head;

bone scan; gallium scan; liver/spleen scan; and abdominal
or pelvic ultrasound. Because surveillance care guidelines
recommend not only the type of care but also its timing,
we evaluated the frequency of care receipt and the time
interval between the initial and subsequent receipt of the
same type of examination/test.
Finally, we evaluated whether the patient received
NCCN and ASCO guideline-recommended surveillance
care. This was done by estimating the time (in days) from
the index date to the date by which a patient had received
the minimum amount and type of surveillance testing
recommended by the guideline. For patients with breast
cancer, this included 2 physical examinations and 1 mammogram, whereas for those with colorectal cancer, this
included 2 physical examinations and 1 complete examination of the colon. In addition to time, we also reported
the percentage of patients who received recommended
care within 18 months after treatment with curative
intent. This was done because care receipt in practice
rarely falls neatly within 12-month periods.

Analytical Approach

Because of the differing lengths of follow-up among sample members, we used Kaplan-Meier estimates to evaluate
the median time to initial and subsequent care receipt
by type of examination/test. We reported the percentage
of patients receiving care within the corresponding 18
months using actuarial results. Kaplan-Meier estimates
were also used to determine cumulative incidences of the
receipt of the minimum recommended surveillance care.
Estimates were evaluated for the entire population of survivors as well as separately for 4 age groups: those aged
< 50 years, those aged 50 years to 64 years, those aged 65
years to 74 years, and those aged  75 years. We plotted
values as the probability of the complement so that graphs
reflected time to receipt of care. We used Cox proportional hazards models, which also account for the differing
length of follow-up among sample members, to quantify
the effects of baseline clinical and sociodemographic
patient characteristics, including patient age group, on the
risk of receiving metastatic testing (a nonrecommended
care type) within the initial 18 months. In addition to age,
models were adjusted for the patient’s race, sex (only
for the colorectal cancer sample), stage, neighborhood
household income, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index,
and health plan. All analyses were performed using SAS
software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Statistical results achieving a P < .05 were considered to be
statistically significant.

RESULTS
Cohort Characteristics

The characteristics of the 6205 breast cancer patients and
2297 colorectal cancer patients by health plan are shown
in Table 1. The mean ages of the cohorts were 62.4 years
( 12.6 years) for patients with breast cancer and 68.6
years ( 12.2 years) for patients with colorectal cancer,
with 57% of the breast cancer patients aged < 65 years
and 35% of the patients with colorectal cancer aged < 65
years. Although the study included only female breast cancer patients, the gender distribution for colorectal cancer
was 49% male and 51% female. African Americans represented 8% of the breast cancer sample and 8% of the colorectal cancer sample. For breast cancer, the majority of
tumors were classified as being of local stage (80%),
whereas among the colorectal cancer group there was a

and regional disease (51%). Per study eligibility criteria,
all patients received curative surgical treatment. The overall median length of observation was 49.5 months for
patients with breast cancer and 40.9 months for patients
with colorectal cancer. Evidence of recurrent cancer or a
second primary tumor occurred in 13% of patients with
breast cancer and 22% of patients with colorectal cancer.
Nearly 96% of patients with breast cancer survived
through the end of follow-up, compared with 90% of
patients with colorectal cancer. This survival rate was 99%
for those with breast cancer who were aged < 65 years versus 91% for patients aged  65 years. In patients with
colorectal cancer, the survival rate for patients aged < 65
years was 97% compared with 86% for patients aged
 65 years. Survival differences by age group (aged < 65
years vs aged > 65 years) in both the breast and colorectal
cancer patient cohorts were statistically significant (data
not shown).

Receipt of Surveillance Care

Results from the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the
time to initial and subsequent receipt of specific examinations and procedures are shown in Table 2. These results
are presented for all ages combined, and separately for
each of the 4 aforementioned age groups. For both cancer
sites, the overwhelming majority of patients (97.1% of
patients with breast cancer and 98.2% of patients with
colorectal cancer) received the minimum recommended
number of physical examinations within the initial 18
months after treatment with curative intent. The median
time to receipt of the recommended physical examinations ranged from 1.6 months among patients with breast
cancer to 1.8 months among patients with colorectal
cancer. If we consider the time to subsequent receipt of
physical examinations, then a majority of cancer survivors
received at least twice the number of recommended physical examinations within the initial year after treatment.
Among both breast and colorectal cancer patients, the
5647

Original Article

median time to receipt of a subsequent physical examination was just over 2 months, suggesting that many patients
received 2 physical examinations within the initial 4
months after treatment.
Most breast cancer patients received recommended
local recurrence testing within 18 months. Among this
group, 87.2% of patients underwent mammograms
within 18 months of treatment, with a median of 7.2
months. Only 55% of colorectal cancer survivors received
a complete examination of the colon within the first 18
months. The median time to initial receipt of this test was
13.3 months. Table 2 also shows the relatively common
use of metastatic disease testing among cancer survivors.
Nearly 65% of breast cancer survivors and 73% of colorectal cancer survivors received some type of metastatic
disease testing within 18 months after treatment with
curative intent. The median time to the initial receipt
of metastatic testing in patients with breast cancer was
9.4 months, and was 6.1 months in patients with colorectal cancer.
When comparing the 4 age groups among breast
cancer survivors, the percentage of patients receiving a
mammogram within 18 months of treatment with curative intent was similar among the middle 2 age groups,
with 89% and 91%, respectively, but was significantly
lower in the group of patients aged < 50 years (82%) and
those aged  75 years (82%). Among colorectal cancer
survivors, the younger 3 age groups had similar rates of
colon examinations within 18 months of treatment with
curative intent, with 63%, 64%, and 62%, respectively,
but a significantly lower rate was noted among the survivors aged  75 years (41%). In the interim,, we observed
a small but significant increase in the receipt of metastatic
testing within the first 18 months after treatment with
curative intent associated with increasing age for both
breast and colorectal cancer survivors.
Figure 1 shows estimates of the time to minimum
guideline-recommended surveillance care during the initial year (ie, 2 physical examinations and 1 mammogram
for breast cancer survivors and 2 physical examinations
and 1 complete examination of the colon for colorectal
cancer survivors), stratified by age group. Overall, nearly
90% of breast cancer survivors received the recommended
surveillance care within 18 months of treatment with curative intent, although the rates are higher for those
patients aged 50 years through 74 years compared with
their younger and older counterparts. It is interesting to
note that, regardless of age, the overwhelming majority of
these patients received that care well before reaching the
12-month mark after their treatment with curative intent.
5648

Figure 1. The likelihood of initial 1-year minimum guidelinerecommended service receipt for survivors of breast and
colorectal cancer is shown.

Conversely, just greater than one-half of colorectal cancer
survivors received the recommended surveillance care
within 18 months of treatment with curative intent, with
all age groups having similar rates except for the patients
aged  75 years, who recorded significantly lower rates
of receipt.
Factors Associated With Metastatic Disease
Testing

Results of the Cox proportional hazards models for receipt
of metastatic disease testing within 18 months of treatment with curative intent among breast cancer patients
are presented in Table 3. As shown in the table, a diagnosis in any of the 3 younger age groups, compared with
those aged  75 years, was associated with a higher likelihood of receiving metastatic testing for patients aged
< 50 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13), for those aged 50
years to 64 years (HR, 1.15), and for those aged 65 years
to 74 years (HR, 1.13). The diagnosis of in situ
(HR, 0.31) or regional (HR, 0.57) disease decreased the

likelihood of receiving metastatic disease surveillance testing. White breast cancer survivors (HR, 1.13), those with
a higher Charlson-Deyo comorbidity index (HR, 1.17),
and those receiving care at health plan 1 (HR, 1.76) had a
greater likelihood of receiving metastatic testing. We also
found significant (P < .01) variation with regard to the
use of metastatic testing by health plan. Table 4 shows the
results of the Cox proportional hazards models for the
receipt of metastatic disease testing within 18 months of
treatment with curative intent among patients with colorectal cancer. Testing for metastatic disease was more
likely to occur among patients aged < 50 years (HR,
1.31), or those aged 50 years to 64 years (HR, 1.25), or
those aged 65 years to 74 years (HR, 1.11). Patients with
more comorbidities (HR, 1.10) were also more likely to
receive metastatic testing, but were less likely to do so if
they were diagnosed with in situ (HR, 0.30) or local (HR,
0.60) disease. Testing for metastatic disease also varied
significantly by health plan (P < .01).
DISCUSSION
Among geographically diverse cohorts of breast and colorectal cancer survivors, we found deviations in the surveillance care received relative to guideline recommendations
for physical examinations and local recurrence and metastatic disease screening. Although many cancer survivors
appear to be receiving the minimum recommended
surveillance care, a large number, regardless of age, are still
not receiving minimum care recommendations whereas

testing as well as recommended care at a greater frequency
than what is suggested.
In the integrated delivery systems studied in the
current study, the overwhelming majority of breast and
colorectal cancer survivors received the minimum recommended number of posttreatment physical examinations.
In fact, the majority of both breast and colorectal cancer
survivors, regardless of age or location of care, appear to
receive physical examinations more frequently than is recommended by national guidelines. However, despite such
examinations and national guideline recommendations,
nearly one-half of the colorectal cancer cohort failed to
receive a complete examination of the colon within 18
months of treatment. Conversely, the majority of breast
cancer survivors received recommended recurrence testing. Regardless of cancer site, greater than 67% of survivors, particularly those who were younger, received some
type of metastatic disease testing within 18 months, none
of which is recommended by evidence-based guidelines.
Furthermore, there were significant differences with
regard to the receipt of metastatic testing among health
plans that may be a result of regional and practice variations. In addition to these organizational differences, the
findings of the current study highlight the patient factors
associated with the use of metastatic disease testing. In
fact, very little is known about what clinical factors (such
as type and duration of treatment) clinicians might

consider when making surveillance care recommendations
to their patients. Clearly there is more to be understood
about not only the multilevel factors associated with the
receipt of undercare and overcare relative to guideline
recommendations, but also the health and economic
implications of such care use.
Compared with prior studies,10,12,14,16,18 the results
of the current study appear to illustrate an increase in the
receipt of recommended mammograms within 18 months
of treatment with curative intent, as well as a decline in
the use of nonrecommended metastatic testing among
survivors of both breast and colorectal cancer. However,
these improvements in care quality appeared to occur concurrently with a decrease in the receipt of recommended
colon examinations among patients with colorectal cancer. Furthermore, consistent with prior studies,10,15,21,24,25 we found that age, stage, race (in patients
with breast cancer only), and comorbidities at the time of
diagnosis impacted the receipt of metastatic disease testing. Additional clinical evidence is needed to justify
whether such variations reflect an opportunity for quality
improvement from a public health perspective.
The IOM recommends that all cancer survivors
receive a survivorship care plan that includes clear and
effective recommendations regarding preventive practices
and specific information concerning the timing and content of recommended follow-up.1 European studies have
highlighted that patients exhibit a positive attitude toward
follow-up care and want follow-up plans to be tailored to
their specific needs.26-29 There is growing evidence that
survivors in the United States have similar preferences,
and that they wish to collaborate with providers in making
medical decisions and want to receive care plan information directly.30-32 It remains unknown whether the patterns of follow-up care observed herein are consistent with
those preferences. However, because we have no evidence
that such plans were routinely used during the time of
observation in any of the organizations studied herein, it
is likely safe to assume that the observed patterns of
follow-up are as much a result of a lack of explicit followup planning and care coordination as a coordinated and
well-planned effort. Given that each of the participating
organizations is an integrated delivery system with a
comprehensive EMR system, and each routinely scores
well on publicly available quality metrics,33 it appears
clear that although substantive quality gains may have
been made at either end of the cancer care continuum, as
the IOM report points out, care delivered during the transition from cancer patient to cancer survivor more often
than not is inadequate.

The conclusions of the current study should be
interpreted in the light of several important limitations.
First, caution should be used when generalizing study
results and conclusions to other populations and settings.
Study cohort members were limited to insured individuals
who received their cancer care from 1 of 4 integrated
health care delivery systems. Although these samples are
generally similar to the general populations in their
respective communities in terms of demographics, they
may differ in other unmeasured respects. In particular,
care should be taken in generalizing the findings of the
current study to patients who are uninsured. Another
limitation is that we are unable to ascertain from EMR or
claims-based sources whether care received was for surveillance versus other purposes. Thus, our findings of surveillance care overuse may be partially explained by our lack
of information regarding symptoms and laboratory
findings and our inability to differentiate between procedures received for screening versus diagnostic purposes.
However, a prior study found that claims data capturing
procedures and visit use for characterizing guideline
adherence was comparable to documentation found in
the medical record, and that administrative data could be
used to describe patterns of follow-up care.13 A further
limitation stems from grouping patients, with heterogeneity in prognoses, into general disease stages. Patients
within these broad groups and the clinicians treating them
may resort to different surveillance practices based on perceived differences in prognosis. Yet it is important to note
that current guidelines do not differ in their recommendations for surveillance care based on these or other factors.
Compared with other phases of cancer control and
prevention, surveillance care among cancer survivors
appears to be understudied. The findings of the current
study highlight the wide variations that exist in cancer surveillance care among seemingly clinically similar patients
and across different age groups. This variation combined
with the overall lack of concordance with established clinical practice guidelines highlights the need for research
exploring both whether observed variations are driven by
patient preferences and reflect informed decision-making
and how survivorship planning as outlined by the IOM
can impact such variations. Furthermore, given the survival advantage for patients aged < 65 years, it is important to consider the care trajectory and its implications
among this subset of cancer patients.
