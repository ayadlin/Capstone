BACKGROUND: Despite targeted antiemetics, data support an unmet need related to the management of delayed nausea and vomiting (NV). Promising pilot data informed this phase III trial evaluating gabapentin for delayed NV from highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). METHODS: Participants were randomized to receive prophylactic treatment with 20 mg of dexamethasone and a 5HT3
receptor antagonist (RA) on the day of chemotherapy, followed by gabapentin 300 mg twice a day and dexamethasone (dex) or placebo and dex after HEC. Gabapentin/placebo was started the day of chemotherapy and continued through day 5 for the first chemotherapy cycle, whereas dex was titrated down on days 2-4. The primary end point was complete response (CR), defined as no emesis
and no use of rescue medications on days 2-6, using an NV diary. The percentages of those in each group with a CR were compared
by Fisher’s exact test. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty patients were enrolled in this study. Forty-seven percent of patients in the gabapentin arm and 41% in the placebo arm had a CR (P 5.23). Mean number of emesis episodes was <0.5 daily, and mean nausea severity was < 2 (mild). In both arms, patient satisfaction with NV control was greater than 8 (with 10 being perfectly satisfied). There were
no significant differences in unwanted side effects. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, gabapentin did not significantly improve delayed
NV. Patients were satisfied with the control of their nausea and vomiting irrespective of arm. The use of a 5HT3 RA and dexamethaC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Nausea and Vomiting in Chemotherapy

Nausea and vomiting have been long-standing, dreaded ill effects of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting (CINV) has been commonly cited by patients as among the “most unpleasant and distressing” side effects associated with chemotherapy.1 Consequences of CINV include dehydration, anorexia, weight loss, and fluid/electrolyte disturbances, some of which can be potentially life-threatening. These side effects can lead not only to significant decreases in
cancer patients’ quality of life, but also to dose reductions, treatment delays or discontinuation of treatment, threatening
the potential for a good outcome. In addition to the impact on individual patients, there remains a significant medical economic burden because of unplanned office or emergency visits and rescue therapies required as a result of uncontrolled
CINV.2-5
Delayed Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting

Two distinct forms of CINV have been recognized: acute and delayed. Acute nausea and vomiting occurs within the first
24 hours after chemotherapy administration. Delayed CINV has historically been defined as nausea and vomiting that
occurs greater than 24 hours after chemotherapy, lasting up to 5 days after chemotherapy administration.6 With the

evolution of 5HT3 receptor antagonists, control of acute
CINV has significantly improved. 5HT3 antagonists in
combination with corticosteroids have become the standard treatment for acute CINV for moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy (MEC) regimens, and newer agents have
become the standard for highly emetogenic chemotherapy
(HEC).7,8 Despite this, control of delayed nausea and
vomiting remains an important unmet need with more
than 50% of patients experiencing delayed nausea after
moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy and
30%-50% reporting delayed emesis.3,9
The pathophysiology of delayed CINV is poorly
understood. The binding of substance P to NK-1 receptors has been implicated in animal studies 10,11. Therefore, NK-1 receptor antagonists, such as aprepitant and
casopitant, were developed and have shown improvement
in rates of nausea and emesis control.12-16
Current American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) guidelines recommend dexamethasone plus a
5HT3 receptor antagonist and an NK-1 receptor antagonist for the prevention of CINV in chemotherapeutic regimens of high emetogenic potential.17 However, there are
2 significant issues that may limit the use of NK-1 receptor antagonists as widespread standard therapy. First,
there is a significant cost to the medication, which can
pose a financial burden to those without prescription drug
coverage. Second, aprepitant is metabolized by the P450
system, specifically CYP3A4, potentially causing significant interactions with a variety of common medications
metabolized through the same pathway. Thus, other effective options for delayed nausea and vomiting warrant further investigation.
The Role of Gabapentin in Delayed CINV

Gabapentin is structurally related to the neurotransmitter
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but does not bind
GABA-A or GABA-B receptors and may exert its effect
via the modulation of release of excitatory neurotransmitters. The potential role of gabapentin in reducing
delayed CINV was first noted anecdotally. Together with
a case report, Guttuso et al18 published an open-label
proof-of-concept study of 9 women being treated for
breast cancer with doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for 4
cycles.18 Guttuso et al theorized that gabapentin may mitigate tachykinin neurotransmitter activity and lead to
physiologic activity similar to that seen with NK-1 receptor antagonists, making it a potential intervention for
delayed nausea and vomiting. In fact, animal studies provide data to support the role of both central and peripheral
mechanisms involved in vomiting, and the relation of sub3576

stance P and tachykinin receptor involvement in this
physiology.10,19 Although the precise mechanism of action
of gabapentin remains elusive, some basic scientists concluded that gabapentin binding sites may be both pre- and
postsynaptic and are shared by NK-1 receptors.19 That hypothesis made gabapentin an interesting and promising
agent to evaluate for CINV. Three pilot studies20-22 provided data to support further evaluation of gabapentin to
reduce delayed nausea and vomiting, with only 1 study
being a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.20
Based on these promising pilot trials, we endeavored
to test gabapentin in a large, phase III trial for delayed
CINV. It could be argued that the best trial of gabapentin’s
efficacy for preventing delayed nausea and vomiting would
be a noninferiority design against aprepitant. However,
this design would be cost-prohibitive because of the price
of aprepitant. In addition, at the time this study was developed, aprepitant was not widely used in the community
setting. Therefore, we used a phase III, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study design to evaluate
the efficacy of gabapentin to reduce delayed CINV, to
assess its tolerability, and to study its effects on quality-oflife-related variables in patients undergoing chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria

Patients eligible for this study included adults with a performance status of 0-2 who were scheduled to receive
HEC . Participants must have been chemotherapy-naive
for highly and moderately emetogenic agents. Participants
needed to be able to provide written informed consent
and be able to swallow pills. Chemotherapy regimens
were required to include at least 7 days between cycles of
highly emetogenic chemotherapy administration;
multiple-day chemotherapy was permitted as long as the
chemotherapy drugs given on subsequent days had mild
or no emetogenic potential.
Exclusion criteria included current and prior use of
or sensitivity to gabapentin or other anticonvulsants and
current or planned use of lorazepam, diphenhydramine,
eszopiclone, and/or dronabinol during the 6 days of this
study, except for treatment of breakthrough nausea and
vomiting. In addition, previoius or planned use of aprepitant or any other NK-1 receptor antagonist was prohibited during the study. Patients were also excluded for any
of the following: having received pelvic or abdominal
radiotherapy within a week of randomization, having had
nausea or vomiting or having used antiemetics within 3
days prior to randomization, and having gastrointestinal

obstruction, active peptic ulcer disease, uncontrolled heartburn, or a history of nausea and vomiting related to any
chemotherapy.
Random Assignment

Participants were stratified according to several variables
that have been shown to be associated with the risk of nausea and vomiting.23,24 This included type of chemotherapy
regimen (cisplatin based versus other), sex, age (younger
than 50 versus 50 or older), or a history of alcoholism,
motion sickness, or pregnancy-induced nausea/vomiting.
Patients were randomized to either gabapentin or an identical placebo capsule, using the Pocock and Simon dynamic
allocation procedure, which balances the marginal distribution of the stratification factors between the treatment
groups.25 Both participants and medical personnel were
blinded to treatment assignments. Each participant signed
an institutional review board–approved, protocol-specific
informed consent in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines. This phase III therapeutic trial was monitored at least twice annually by the North Central Cancer
Treatment Group, now the Alliance, Data and Safety Monitoring Board, a standing committee composed of individuals from within and outside the cooperative group. Data
quality was ensured by review of data by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center and by the study chairperson following alliance policies. Data collection and statistical analyses
were conducted by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center.
Treatment Protocol

Patients took 1 tablet (gabapentin 300 mg or placebo) beginning on the evening of day 1 of their first chemotherapy cycle. On days 2 and 3, the dose was increased to 1
tablet gabapentin/placebo twice a day. On days 4 and 5,
patients could be titrated up to 1 tablet 3 times a day
(gabapentin/placebo) if the patient was not having the
response they desired. This dose was based on the positive
study by Sarkar and colleagues.21 All patients were treated
prophylactically for acute nausea and vomiting with a
5HT3 receptor antagonist of the provider/patient’s choice
and dexamethasone 20 mg on day 1. On days 2 through
4, participants were prophylactically treated with decreasing doses of dexamethasone (8 mg by mouth twice a day
on days 2 and 3, and 4 mg by mouth twice a day on day 4)
with or without a 5HT3 receptor antagonist per physician
preference for delayed nausea and vomiting, in accordance
with ASCO guidelines. At the time of this protocol,
ASCO guidelines did not recommend prophylactic treatment with a 5HT3 receptor antagonist for delayed nausea
and vomiting.17,26

The study encompassed the first cycle of chemotherapy only. The rationale for this was that if a patient developed delayed nausea and vomiting, there were other Food
and Drug Administration–approved treatments for
delayed CINV, and it would not be ethical to keep the
patient on something that was not helpful for an additional chemotherapy cycle when he/she could be switched
to another potentially helpful option.
Endpoints and Outcome Measures

Patients were instructed to keep a record of each emetic
episode as it occurred, a practice consistent with a majority of the seminal trials evaluating antiemetics.27-30 The
nausea and vomiting diary began the day of chemotherapy
and continued through day 6. The primary end point was
the percentage of those with a complete response (CR),
defined as no emesis and no rescue medications days 2-6
using a daily diary for nausea and vomiting. In addition,
participants recorded their average and worst levels of
nausea severity on a 0- to 10-point scale (with 10 being
the worst) as well as any rescue medication use, daily.
Daily rankings of treatment satisfaction and distress were
also recorded using questions with numeric analog scales
ranging from 0 to 10 (with 10 being high distress, high
satisfaction).
Secondary end points included the percentage of
complete responders, defined differently as 1) having no
emetic episodes and 2) no more than mild nausea (2.5
on a 0 to 10-point scale),30 and 3) no rescue medication
use on days 2-6, as captured using the daily diary. The secondary analysis also included adverse effects and tolerability, which were assessed using 2 measures, a self-report
numeric analog scale and NCI Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v3.0). Self-reported
side effects on questionnaires included drowsiness,
impaired concentration, diarrhea, fatigue, mood swings,
and loss of appetite, rated on a scale of 0 to 10 (with 10
being the most severe). These were completed on days 1
and 6. This scale was converted to a 0-100 scale for the
analysis, with higher numbers indicating better healthrelated quality of life. Providers graded dizziness, somnolence, ataxia, and edema using the CTCAE v3.0 on days
1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
An additional secondary end point evaluated function with the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE).31
This is a self-report scale to evaluate the impact of nausea
and vomiting on the patient’s daily function that has been
used in numerous trials evaluating antiemetic therapy.
There are 2 subscales, one for nausea and one for vomiting. The subscales can also be combined for a total score.

Figure 1. CONSORT diagram.

Total scores range from 18 to 126, with higher scores
indicating better health-related quality of life. Internal
consistency is reported with a Cronbach’s alpha of .79.
Construct validity is reported with correlations of items
within the nausea subscale of 0.84 to 0.95. These correlations are a bit weaker in the vomiting domain, ranging
from 0.52 to 0.76. Distress from nausea and vomiting
control was evaluated as part of the daily diary with
numeric analog scales with responses ranging from 0
(none) to 10 (as bad as it can be). Satisfaction with nausea
and vomiting control was assessed similarly, from 0 (not
at all satisfied) to 10 (totally satisfied).
Statistical Analysis

The primary analysis was intent to treat and used Fisher’s
exact test to compare the percentage of complete responders in the treatment groups (dexamethasone [dex]/gabapentin vs dex placebo). Patients who did not complete the
study or did not provide complete data were assumed to
be nonresponders. The study was powered to detect a
15% difference in responder rates17 between the treatment groups using a 2-tailed alternative, a 5% type I error
rate, and achieving 80% power. This required a minimum
of 378 patients, (189 per treatment arm). Target accrual
was inflated by 10% to account for ineligible and canceled
cases, thus making the total target accrual 416 patients.
For the secondary end points, total and subscale
scores of the FLIE were calculated as well as satisfaction
3578

ratings for nausea and vomiting. Mean values of groups
were compared using Kruskal-Wallis testing. Analysis of
differences with side effects on the self-report measure
involved calculating mean scores for each side effect and
comparing differences between groups using KruskalWallis testing. The incidence of toxicities rated using the
CTCAE v.3 were compared between groups using Fisher’s exact tests for incidence. All tests were 2-sided tests
with 5% type 1 error rate using SAS version 9.2.
RESULTS
Between May 1, 2009, and February 4, 2011, 430
patients were enrolled at 27 participating clinical sites, primarily community cancer centers. Data were frozen for
analysis on August 7, 2011. Patient participation and flow
are depicted in a CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1). Baseline
patient characteristics are shown in Table 1, illustrating
that all baseline factors were evenly distributed between
the 2 study arms.
Primary End Point

Ninety-seven of 207 patients (47%) in the gabapentin
arm and 84 of 206 patients (41%) in the placebo arm had
a complete response (CR; P 5 .23). The percent of responders by day is shown in Figure 2. When nausea severity 2.5 was included as part of the secondary analysis, 91
of those on gabapentin (44%) and 81 of those on placebo
(39%) had a CR (P 5 .37). At some time during the

toward less distress in the gabapentin arm (P 5 .06;
Table 5).
Dosing

The protocol allowed for titration of the study drug from
twice to 3 times per day, beginning on day 4, for inadequate control of nausea or vomiting. On day 4, 8% of
those in the gabapentin arm and 9% in the placebo arm
increased their daily dose. On day 5, 4% of the gabapentin
arm and 6% of the placebo arm reported taking study
drug 3 times per day. This was not statistically significantly different between arms.
DISCUSSION
The present study is the first large placebo-controlled
double-blind, randomized trial investigating the efficacy
of gabapentin in controlling delayed CINV. Despite
promising pilot study data and a rational physiologic hypothesis, the results of the current study did not provide
support for the use of gabapentin to reduce delayed CINV
beyond what is possible with dexamethasone.
Complete response rates were lower than what was
anticipated based on published literature. In the placebo/
corticosteroid group, a complete response rate of 50% was
expected based on the ASCO guideline summary of studies using dexamethasone alone as the control arm.17 The
complete response in clinical trials for aprepitant with
dexamethasone (defined as no emesis and no rescue agent)
is reported to be about 65% (average of 55% and 72%
CR).17 Curiously, however, mean nausea severity was
low, daily emesis was low, distress was low, satisfaction
was high, and the results for the FLIE indicate that nausea

and vomiting in this study did not negatively affect functioning. It is puzzling that fewer than one-third of the
sample experienced emesis, but a high number of patients
(45% and 53%) took rescue medication despite an overall
low mean nausea severity. One hypothesis as to why this
occurred is that patients might have taken rescue medications more prophylactically than for actual “rescue” of
moderate nausea and vomiting. Although the treatment
for CINV has improved drastically, it is still a side effect
dreaded by patients. It is possible that the fear of experiencing nausea and vomiting may trump all, causing
patients to take medications “just in case.”
It is important to highlight that according to published literature,3,32 the results of the FLIE indicate that
patients in this study did not experience a negative impact
on their daily functioning from nausea and vomiting.
Overall, scores of 108 or higher are indicative of no problems, and item scores of 6 or more indicate no problems.

shown in Table 4, each question in the vomiting subscale
had means and medians greater than 6. In the nausea subscale, 5 of 9 items had means slightly less than 6, but
medians were 6-7. The lack of problems with nausea and
vomiting is further supported by the very low distress rates

and high satisfaction with the control of nausea and vomiting. The use of evidence-based clinical guidelines for
prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting provides strong clinical guidance for effective treatment and clearly leads to
good patient outcomes.
It is noteworthy that the daily complete response
rates were significantly different, initially favoring gabapentin, on days 2 through 4, but then converging on
days 5 and 6. Day 4 was the last day dexamethasone
was given. This finding raises the question of whether
there may be synergy between dexamethasone and
gabapentin.
One limitation of this study was the initial twice-aday dosing. Although this was based on a previously positive study,21 other studies used 3-times-a-day dosing.20,22
Although this protocol allowed titration up to 3 times per
day on day 4, and only 9% of patients increased their dose
overall, it cannot be ruled out that starting with 3-times-aday dosing may have produced different results. A second
limitation is that the best study design for this trial might
have been a noninferiority design.
In summary, gabapentin did not improve delayed
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting beyond

what prophylactic dexamethasone provided. Overall, despite lower than expected complete response rates, the
number of emetic events was low, and nausea severity was
mild. Patients were quite satisfied with the control of their
nausea and vomiting irrespective of arm. The use of standard prophylactic guidelines that included a 5HT3 receptor agonist and dexamethasone provided good control of
nausea and vomiting for most patients. Although it is
acknowledged that delayed nausea and vomiting is less
well controlled than acute, these results support that it is a
minority of patients who have significant issues with nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy if standard guidelines are followed. Future studies should therefore focus
on identifying the approximately 25% of patients who
have moderate to severe nausea and emesis that affects
their functioning despite evidence-based prophylactic
treatment. Rather than designing studies for “all comers”
with respect to HEC, future studies might select for and
focus on this smaller subset who remain in critical need of
better management.
