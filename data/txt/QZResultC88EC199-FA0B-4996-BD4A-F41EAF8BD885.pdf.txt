ABSTRACT
The development of cancer is often accompanied by a loss of the primary cilium,
a microtubule-based cellular protrusion that functions as a cellular antenna and that
puts a break on cell proliferation. Hence, restoration of the primary cilium in cancer
cells may represent a novel promising approach to attenuate tumor growth. Using a
high content analysis-based approach we screened a library of clinically evaluated
compounds and marketed drugs for their ability to restore primary cilium expression
in pancreatic ductal cancer cells. A diverse set of 118 compounds stimulating cilium
expression was identified. These included glucocorticoids, fibrates and other nuclear
receptor modulators, neurotransmitter regulators, ion channel modulators, tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitors, antibacterial compounds,
protein inhibitors, microtubule modulators, and COX inhibitors. Certain compounds
also dramatically affected the length of the cilium. For a selection of compounds
(Clofibrate, Gefitinib, Sirolimus, Imexon and Dexamethasone) their ability to restore
ciliogenesis was confirmed in a panel of human cancer cell line models representing
different cancer types (pancreas, lung, kidney, breast). Most compounds attenuated
cell proliferation, at least in part through induction of the primary cilium, as
demonstrated by cilium removal using chloral hydrate. These findings reveal that
several commonly used drugs restore ciliogenesis in cancer cells, and warrant further
investigation of their antineoplastic properties.

INTRODUCTION

pathways including Wnt, planar cell polarity, and
Hedgehog signaling [2–4]. Defects that compromise
ciliary function contribute to specific disorders including
Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD), Birt-Hogg-Dubé
(BHD) syndrome, Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS)
and others. Interestingly, several of these syndromes
predispose affected carriers to the onset of cancer [5–7].

The primary cilium is a single, microtubulebased structure that protrudes from the surface of most
mammalian cells [1]. It functions as a cellular antenna
that captures signals from the environment and serves as
a hub of key developmental and homeostatic signaling

Moreover, an ever-increasing number of papers report on
a decrease, loss, or distortion of the primary cilium in a
variety of cancer types [8–11]. These include pancreatic
cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and prostate cancer. It
is commonly assumed that the cilium puts a break on cell
proliferation as it uses the same structural components
required for chromosome segregation [12–14]. Loss
of the cilium in cancer cells may, therefore, release this
break and, moreover, may contribute to distorted cellular
signaling, which is a hallmark of cancer. Hence, restoration
of the primary cilium in cancer cells may represent a novel
promising approach to attenuate cell proliferation and may
provide novel opportunities for therapeutic antineoplastic
intervention. However, so far few chemical compounds
are known that normalize ciliogenesis in cancer cells.
Here, we have established a high content analysisbased screening method to identify small molecules that
have the ability to restore the primary cilium in cancer
cells. Further application of this method to screen a
repurposing library composed of clinically evaluated
compounds and marketed drugs revealed that many
commonly used drugs restore the primary cilium in
cancer cells and attenuate cell proliferation. These findings
provide new insight into the spectrum of action of some
commonly used drugs and may promote the expedited
application of cilia-based therapies via repurposing of
existing drugs in the field of oncology and beyond.

the primary cilium signal (fluorescent dot) was enclosed
within the nuclear border of the segmented nuclei. If more
than one cilium-like dot was detected within the nuclear
border, the bigger dot was selected as the match. The
number of ciliated cells was then determined by counting
the total number of nuclei and linked cilia in 20 fields
in a single well. Compounds were considered ciliogenic
based on their ability to increase the percentage of ciliated
cells by at least 3 standard deviations compared to vehicle
control. Using this approach, 156 ciliogenic compounds
were identified in the initial screen. To eliminate false
positives, the initial hits were re-evaluated in triplicate
in a secondary screen using the same screening strategy.
In this screen 118 cilium-enhancing compounds were
confirmed. 110 of these compounds were found to increase
ciliogenesis by at least a factor 2 (Figure 3A). Besides
cilium-enhancing compounds, we identified 22 compounds
that decreased ciliogenesis by at least 2-folds. The
stimulatory compounds were categorized into 9 different
classes based on their potential molecular targets (Table 1).
More than one third of the positive compounds (49/118)
were classified as glucocorticoids, fibrates or other nuclear
receptor modulators (Figure 3B). 14/118 compounds
were categorized as neurotransmitter modulators. Other
classes included ion channel modulators, tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitors,
antibacterial compounds, protein synthesis inhibitors,
microtubule modulators, and COX inhibitors.

RESULTS

Confirmation of ciliogenic ability of
representative compounds by confocal
microscopy

High content analysis-based screening for
cilium-inducing compounds in pancreatic ductal
cancer cells

From the 118 cilium-enhancing compounds
identified in the IN Cell Analyzer screen, we selected 20
representative compounds from the different classes for
reconfirmation of their cilium modulating effect by a
more robust confocal fluorescence microscopy approach,
which also allowed assessment of changes in cilium length
(Figure  4). Clofibrate, Gefitinib, Sirolimus, Imexon,
Ciprofloxacin, and Dexamethasone were the most potent
inducers of cilia in terms of percentage of ciliated cells,
showing a statistically significant increase of 4-fold or
more, relative to control vehicle-treated cells (Figure 4A).
In terms of cilium length, Imexon, Clofibrate, and Xylazine
induced a significant increase of 4-fold or more, relative
to control conditions (Figure 4B). Some compounds like
Clofibrate and Imexon were potent inducers of both cilium
percentage and cilium length whereas other compounds
primarily enhanced cilium percentage (e.g. Gefitinib).
Figure 5A shows representative confocal microscopy
pictures of primary ciliation of cells treated with the most
potent compounds as revealed by staining for acetylated
tubulin. To confirm that genuine primary cilia are induced
by the drugs, cilia were stained for IFT88, an alternative
marker of the primary cilium (Figure 5B).

To screen a compound library for potential
modulators of ciliogenesis, we developed an immuno­
fluorescence microscopy-based phenotypic screening
strategy in a 96-well format using an IN Cell 2000 High
Content Analyzer (Figure 1). Pancreatic ductal cancer
cells were chosen as the prime biological model in view
of their well-documented loss of the primary cilium [10].
From a preliminary screening of a panel of human
pancreatic cancer cell lines, CFPAC-1 cells were selected
for the compound screening based on their ability to grow
as flat monolayers, which is a prerequisite for accurate
automated image acquisition, and for their inherent low
rate of ciliogenesis, even at a high confluence (Figure 2).
After incubation with 1600 different compounds from
the Pharmakon 1600 library (all drugs added at 10
micromolar in DMSO), the percentage of ciliated cells
was assessed in single wells by fluorescence microscopybased visualization of the primary cilium using antibodies
targeting cilium-associated acetylated tubulin. Nuclei were
stained with Hoechst-33258. Images were analyzed using
IN Cell Developer software according to the workflow
illustrated in Figure 2. A cell was considered ciliated when

results confirm the potential of the identified compounds
as cilium inducers in cancer cells.

To corroborate the ability of these compounds to
induce cilia in cancer cells, we tested a selection of the
most potent compounds (Clofibrate, Gefitinib, Sirolimus,
Imexon and Dexamethasone) in a panel of human
cell lines representing different cancer types: A549
(lung cancer), UMRC2 (kidney cancer), SUM159 (breast
cancer) and L3.6 (pancreatic cancer) cell lines. As shown
in Figure  6, all compounds significantly increased the
percentage of ciliated cells in all the four cell lines. These

Ciliogenic drugs attenuate cell proliferation at
least in part through induction of the primary
cilium
As the presence of the primary cilium is dependent
on the cell cycle and is most prominent in the G0/G1
phase, we examined the effect of the selected drugs on
the cell cycle using FACS analysis. Although under the
culture condition that we used, cultures were not highly

proliferative even in control conditions, most compounds
resulted in a further increase in the percentage of cells
in the G0/G1 phase, indicative of a further induction of
growth arrest (Figure  7A). In line with these findings,
most compounds attenuated cell proliferation as assessed
by a spheroid formation assay of L3.6 cells (Figure 7B)
and BrdU incorporation in CFPAC-1 cells (Figure 7C). To
explore to what extent primary cilium occurs secondarily
to the growth arrest or in fact actively contributes to the
observed attenuation of cell proliferation, we assessed
the effect of these compounds on cell proliferation in the
presence of the deciliation agent chloral hydrate, which

completely removed the cilium (Figure 7C). Interestingly,
in most cases deciliation largely restored cell proliferation
of compound-treated cells (Figure 7C), indicating that the
antiproliferative effect of these compounds is at least in
part caused by their ability to induce the primary cilium.

DISCUSSION
Building on the emerging concept that loss of the
primary cilium is linked to the development of several
tumor types and that re-establishing the expression of
this organelle may attenuate tumor growth, we have

developed a semi-high-throughput approach to identify
stimulators of ciliogenesis in cancer cells. Screening of
the Pharmakon 1600 library resulted in the identification
of 118 compounds that showed the ability to restore cilium
expression in cancer cell line models. Among these were
many glucocorticoids (43/118 hits or 43/47 glucocorticoids
in the entire library). A diverse set of other drugs was
identified including many neurotransmitter regulators and
ion channel modulators. Some of the compounds from our
screen such as dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, estradiol,
pargyline and lithium have previously been described
as enhancers of the percentage of ciliated cells and/or
of cilium length [15–19]. Others, like beclomethasone,
fluticasone, flunisolide, mannitol and arginine are known
to affect ciliary beat frequency (CBF), which in many

cases varies with dosage and length of treatment [20–23].
It has been suggested that beta-adrenergic receptor
modulators may have a therapeutic role in the treatment
of Primary Cilia Dyskinesia (PCD) [24, 25]. Pioglitazone
has been shown to have beneficial effects in the treatment
of Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) [26]. Ciliomodulatory activities have also been attributed to several
other compounds from our screen like triamcinolone,
budesonide, paroxetine, oxymetazoline and docetaxel
[23, 27–30]. Imexon, a potent enhancer of cilium length
as shown in our results, is a known inducer of apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest in pancreatic cancer cells [31].
For this reason it has been used in combination drug
trials along with gemcitabine for the treatment of patients
with advanced pancreatic cancer. The anti-diarrheal drug

loperamide, a good inducer of cilia in our models, has
been reported as a potential anti-tumor agent due to its
ability to induce apoptosis [32].
With respect to the mechanisms underlying the
cilium modulating effects of these compounds, many
of them (steroid receptor modulators, neurotransmitter
modulators, ion channel modulators) are known to
affect levels of cAMP, calcium or other ions, which are
established regulators of cilium expression and/or cilium
length [33–35] (Figure 8). Microtubule modulators may
affect the microtubule assembly and extension in the cilium

or may disturb the transport towards the cilium [36–38].
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may enhance ciliogenesis by
inhibiting ligand-dependent activation of cell-cycle entry
or by regulating the coordination of signaling events
linked to cilium-centrosome axis, that control cell cycle,
differentiation and migration [39, 40]. Ciliogenic effects
of sirolimus (rapamycin) might be mediated through
mTOR signaling which is known to modulate ciliary size
and function through translational regulation [41]. Others
(cephalosporins, DNA gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitors)
are known to affect Aurora kinases [42–44], which

are also well-established regulators of the primary
cilium [45–47]. Several compounds may affect the
cilium through extracellular ATP. Several studies show
a relationship between intracellular calcium levels and
extracellular ATP via the purinergic receptor [48–51]. Also
glucocorticoids promote ATP release from the cell [52].
Many of these compounds also affect cell proliferation as
known from the literature [31, 53–63] or as revealed in
our spheroid and BrdU assays. This effect was not always
proportional to the induction of ciliogenesis, which is
not surprising given the various mechanisms of action of
these compounds. The further characterization of these
mechanisms may be challenging in part because of the
incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of action
of some of these drugs and the processes involved in
ciliogenesis. Many of the compounds we identified cause
cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, which is known to
promote ciliogenesis [13], suggesting that the ciliogenic
effect of some of these compounds may be indirect and
may be downstream of cell cycle arrest. Nevertheless,
our findings that deciliation of compound-treated cells
restores cell proliferation strongly suggest that the
compound-induced ciliogenesis plays an active role in the
antiproliferative effects of these compounds.
Our findings that many common drugs have the
ability to restore the primary cilium in cancer cell line
models may provide interesting new insights in the
spectrum of actions of these compounds and may warrant
further investigation into application of some of these
compounds in future antineoplastic approaches. They
also promote the concept of harnessing the therapeutic
potential of existing drugs for a novel use, generally
referred to as drug repurposing [64–67]. Development
of a new drug is a complex, time-consuming and costly
process, mainly due to pharmacological hurdles like
bioavailability, solubility, stability, toxicity etc., which
form bottlenecks in the therapeutic development process.
This can be overcome by drug repurposing, a strategy that
reduces the time frame, decreases the costs and improves
the success rate by redirecting existing drugs for a new
indication. Most of the drugs from the Pharmakon 1600
Library have already been tested for safety in humans and
data is available on their pharmacology, formulation and
toxicity, paving the way for an accelerated development
of cilia-based therapeutics. The success of our screening
approach also sets the stage to screen other libraries of
new compounds and to establish these as potential novel
antineoplastic agents and/or agents exploitable in other
cilium-related diseases, including classical ciliopathies.

(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Life Technologies). CFPAC-1 (pancreatic cancer) cells
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% FBS. L3.6 (pancreatic cancer)
cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS and 2mM L-Glutamine (Life Technologies).
All cell lines were incubated in a humidified incubator at a
temperature of 37°C and 5% levels of CO2.

Compound library screening
CFPAC-1 cells were seeded in 96-well microplates
at a density of 10,  000 cells/well containing 200  μl
culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
incubated for 48 hours in a humidified incubator (37°C
and 5% CO2), after which medium was refreshed with
200 μl of RPMI-1640 medium containing 2% FBS. The
Pharmakon 1600 chemical library consisting of 1600
clinically evaluated compounds and marketed drugs was
procured from MicroSource Discovery Systems Inc.
(U.S.A). The compounds were dissolved as 10 mM stock
solutions in DMSO and added to culture medium to a
final concentration of 10 μM. Media and compounds were
refreshed on the fourth day after the initial addition of the
compounds. After 8 days of compound incubation, the cells
were chemically fixed and stained with anti-acetylated
tubulin antibody (Sigma, Cat No. T6793-.5ML), which
stains the ciliary axoneme. A fluorescent secondary
antibody (Life Technologies, AlexaFluor 488, Cat No.
A21145) was used against the primary antibody. The nuclei
were counterstained with Hoechst-33258 (Cat No: 382061,
Calbiochem). 20 randomized fields per well were imaged
at a single plane of focus at 20X magnification in DPBS
(Sigma) to reduce auto-fluorescence from the medium and
to minimize signal-to-noise ratio. Images acquired by the
IN Cell Analyzer 2000 (GE Healthcare) were analyzed
using IN Cell Developer software (GE Healthcare).

Confocal microscopy
CFPAC-1 cells were seeded on glass coverslips in
12-well plates containing 1 ml of culture medium per well.
At 30% confluency, cell media was replaced by low serum
medium containing 2% FBS. After 8 days of compound
treatment, cells were fixed with 4% Formaldehyde
(Merck), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X100 (Merck)
in DPBS, blocked with 1% BSA (Applichem) in DPBS,
and incubated with 1:1000 dilution of anti-acetylated
tubulin antibody or 1:500 dilution of anti-IFT88 antibody
(Cat. No. 13967–1-AP, Proteintech) for 1 h, followed by
incubation with 1:1000 dilution of fluorescent secondary
antibody for 1 h. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI
(Vector Laboratories, Vectashield (Cat. No. H-1500).
Images of primary cilia were captured by acquiring
Z-stacks using either a Bio-Rad Radiance or Nikon C2

groups, two-way ANOVA was used followed by Dunnett’s
multiple comparisons test. Differences with p values
of < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

Chemical deciliation

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

CFPAC-1 cells treated with ciliogenic compounds
were exposed to 4 mM chloral hydrate (Cat. No. C8383–
100G, Sigma) for 24 h to remove cilia [68]. Following
deciliation, chloral hydrate was washed out and the cells
were allowed to grow in fresh culture medium for 24 h
before BrdU addition and measurement of proliferation.

This work was supported by grant G0816.13 from
the Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO) (to J.S.) and by

Proliferation assays
Spheroid assay - Tumor spheroids were formed
on agarose-coated (1%) 96-well plates by seeding L3.6
pancreatic cancer cells in 200 μl of culture medium. The
plates were kept undisturbed in a humidified incubator
at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 4 days to facilitate spheroid
formation. Treatment with compounds was started when
the cells aggregated to form spheroids. Compounds
and 50% of the medium were refreshed every 4th day.
Images were captured at the beginning of treatment with
5X objective mounted on an inverted light microscope.
Imaging was done every 4 days for 20 days from the
start of treatment. The images were analyzed by ImageJ
software (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) to calculate the differences
in the volume of spheroids at different time points.
BrdU incorporation assay - BrdU incorporation assay
was performed using 5-Bromo-2-deoxy-uridine Labeling
and Detection Kit III (Cat. No. 11444611001, Roche)
