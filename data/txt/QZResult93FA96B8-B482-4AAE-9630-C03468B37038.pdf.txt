Targeting Quiescent Tumor Cells via Oxygen and IGF-I
Supplementation
Alastair H. Kyle, Jennifer H.E. Baker, and Andrew I. Minchinton

Abstract
Conventional chemotherapy targets proliferating cancer cells, but most cells in solid tumors are not in a
proliferative state. Thus, strategies to enable conventional chemotherapy to target noncycling cells may greatly
increase tumor responsiveness. In this study, we used a 3-dimensional tissue culture system to assay diffusible
factors that can limit proliferation in the context of the tumor microenvironment, with the goal of identifying
targets to heighten proliferative capacity in this setting. We found that supraphysiologic levels of insulin or
insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in combination with oxygen supplementation were sufﬁcient to initiate
proliferation of quiescence cells in this system. At maximal induction with IGF-I, net tissue proliferation increased
3- to 4-fold in the system such that chemotherapy could trigger a 3- to 6-fold increase in cytotoxicity, compared
with control conditions. These effects were conﬁrmed in vivo in colon cancer xenograft models with demonstrations that IGF-I receptor stimulation was sufﬁcient to generate a 45% increase in tumor cell proliferation, along
with a 25% to 50% increase in chemotherapy-induced tumor growth delay. Although oxygen was a dominant
factor limiting in vitro tumor cell proliferation, we found that oxygen supplementation via pure oxygen breathing
at 1 or 2 atmospheres pressure (mimicking hyperbaric therapy) did not decrease hypoxia in the tumor xenograft
mouse model and was insufﬁcient to increase tumor proliferation. Thus, our ﬁndings pointed to IGF-I receptor
stimulation as a rational strategy to successfully increase tumor responsiveness to cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Introduction
The microenvironment of solid tumors has long been identiﬁed as a source of resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Sustained expansion of the tumor cell population and
aberrant neovascularization leads to the creation of an environment that differs from normal tissues. Deregulated proliferation and survival of tumor cells result in increased separation of blood vessels (1, 2) and unstable perfusion (3–6), in turn
leading to poor efﬁciency in the distribution and removal of
molecules supplied by the blood (7–11). For example, tumor
cells can be located up to 15 to 20 cells away from the nearest
blood vessel (more in some cases), whereas in most normal
tissues cells are within just a few cell layers of a vessel (12). The
diffusion gradient of molecules supplied by the blood creates
subpopulations of cells within the tumor that will differ in
proliferation status and response to chemotherapy. This phenomenon is well illustrated in corded HCT116 xenografts,

when gradients in oxygenation and proliferation are mapped
in relation to tumor vasculature (13). As shown in Fig. 1A,
S-phase cells in HCT116 xenografts can be observed nearer to
blood vessels, whereas quiescent cells predominate in areas
further from vessels. Despite uncontrolled proliferation being a
hallmark of cancer, human tumors often exhibit proliferative
indices as low as 5% to 10% (14). Even micrometastases of a
quarter of a millimeter in size will possess regions of hypoxia
and nutrient deprivation leading to tumor cell quiescence
(10, 15). Previous studies examining the microregional activity
of paclitaxel and gemcitabine tissue mapping found that
quiescent cells located far from blood vessels recovered more
readily following treatment (13, 16).
Although numerous factors have been identiﬁed from in
vitro studies that modify tumor cell proliferation, their relative
importance in the context of the tumor microenvironment is
still poorly understood. Limitations in the supply of oxygen,
signaling molecules, and key nutrients such as glutamine as
well as tumor acidiﬁcation have all been implicated as causes
of tumor cell quiescence (17–19). Despite oxygen being a
critical factor in the regulation of proliferation and survival,
it is unclear whether other factors may initiate quiescence in
solid tumors prior to oxygen becoming limiting (15, 20, 21). To
date stimulating tumor cell proliferation for therapeutic gain
using strategies that focus on single factors has largely been
unsuccessful and it might be that identifying more than one
factor will be required (22–24). Tumor-derived quiescence is
likely due to the interrelation of many diffusible factors, an
issue that is compounded by the difﬁculty of independently

screen were evaluated both in terms of their ability to stimulate
proliferation and to resensitize quiescent cells to chemotherapy. Because any strategy that increased tumor cell proliferation between treatments would be more likely to fail, tumors
were transiently stimulated prior to chemotherapy. We hoped
that this approach would favorably alter the balance between
tumor debulking by chemotherapy and regrowth between
treatments. In theory, such a strategy would also maximize
an antiproliferative therapeutic ratio of drug, as normal tissues
are likely less responsive to stimulation because they possess
intact regulatory pathways controlling cell growth and, due to
their efﬁcient vasculature, they will already have access to the
diffusible molecules from which tumor cells have become
deprived.

Monolayer and 3D tissue disk culture
HCT116 and HT29 cells were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection in 2001, and cell type was conﬁrmed
for each experiment via 3D tissue morphology and architecture
as seen in histologic sections. Mycoplasma status was tested on
a monthly basis using Hoechst 33342 labeling of DNA. Cells
were cultured in MEM (HyClone) with 10% FBS (Gibco/BRL)
under 5% O2 and 5% CO2. Three-dimensional tissue disks were
grown by seeding 1  106 cells into collagen-coated tissue
culture inserts (CM 12 mm, pore size 0.4 mm; Millipore) as
previously described (26). Inserts were then incubated for 16
hours to allow cells to attach to the porous membrane prior to
being submerged in media and transferred to stirred growth
vessels (Fig. 1D).

3D tissue disks were transferred from growth vessels (Fig. 1D)
to penetration vessels (Fig. 1E) and immersed in stirred MEM
with 10% FBS. The growth media was then supplemented with
additional factors and the disks incubated for 24 hours. Supplemented factors included 22 mmol/L D-glucose (SigmaAldrich), 2 or 18 mmol/L L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.6
mmol/L L-arginine, 0.1 mmol/L uridine and inoline (SigmaAldrich), 1% ITS cocktail (10 mg/mL insulin, 5.5 mg/mL transferrin and 0.0067 mg/mL selenium; Gibco #41400) or 10 mg/mL

mmol/L pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe-1 Kit; Chemicon International Inc.) were added to the reservoir to label S-phase and
hypoxic cells. Tissue disks were frozen and embedded in O.C.T.
compound in preparation for cryosectioning. For cell survival
experiments, the 3D tissue disks were supplemented with 100
ng/mL LR3-IGF-I under normal or high oxygen conditions (5 or
95% O2) for 12 hours prior to a 6-hour cytotoxic chemotherapy
exposure. Following treatment, tissue disks were rinsed and
returned to fresh media and incubated for an additional 24
hours prior to dissociation using 0.25% trypsin EDTA (SigmaAldrich) for 15 minutes followed by 5-minute DNAase treatment (1.5 mg/mL deoxyribonuclease I from bovine pancreas;
Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then counted and plated for colonyforming assay.
Mice and tumors
Female NODCB17-Prkdcscid/J mice were bred and maintained in our institutional animal facility in accordance with
the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. Experiments
are approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University
of British Columbia. Mice were allowed free access to standard
laboratory rodent food and water and were used between 8 and
14 weeks of age, typically weighing between 20 and 30 g.
HCT116 cells (8  106 cells in 50 mL) or HT29 cells (5  106
cells in 50 mL) were implanted subcutaneously into the sacral
region and tumors grown to 150 mm3 as calculated from
caliper measurement of 3 orthogonal diameters (a, b, and c)
using the formula volume ¼ p/6(abc).
Tumor mapping experiments
Mice were administered with 1 mg/kg LR3-IGF-I by s.c.
injection at 0, 4, 8, and 12 hours alone or in combination with
pure oxygen breathing under 1 or 2 atmospheres pressure.
Hyperbaric work was carried out using a pressurized acrylic
chamber (27). At the 12-hour time point mice were administered 1,000 mg/kg BrdUrd (Sigma-Aldrich) and 60 mg/kg
pimonidazole by intraperitoneal injection and euthanized 2
hours later. Five minutes prior to carbon dioxide euthanasia
and tumor harvest mice were administered 35 mL of 0.6 mg/mL
DiOC7(3) (Sigma-Aldrich) in 25% dimethyl sulfoxide to demarcate perfused vessels. Tumors were then excised, weighed, and
immediately frozen.
Tumor growth delay experiments
Mice were administered 1 mg/kg LR3-IGF-I by subcutaneous injection at times 0, 4, 8, and 12 hours prior to cytotoxic
chemotherapy. Paclitaxel at 30 mg/kg or 120 mg/kg gemcitabine was then administered intraperitoneally. Both the LR3IGF-I and chemotherapy regimens were repeated once weekly
for 3 weeks, except paclitaxel in HCT116 which was administered for 2 weeks only. Tumor volumes were measured 3 times
per week.
Immunohistochemistry: DiOC7(3), CD31, pimonidazole,
and BrdUrd
Prior to immunostaining, slides were imaged for DiOC7(3)

then ﬁxed in a 1:1 mixture of acetone–methanol for 10 minutes

at room temperature. Vasculature was stained using a 1:400
dilution of anti-PECAM/CD31 (BD Pharmingen clone
MEC13.3) and 1:200 ﬂuorescent Alexa 546 anti-rat secondary
(Invitrogen). Hypoxia was detected via bound pimonidazole
adducts using a 1:400 polyclonal rabbit–anti-pimonidazole
(Hypoxyprobe-1 Kit; Chemicon International Inc.) and a
1:200 Alexa 488 anti-rabbit secondary. Slides were imaged for
ﬂuorescence and then transferred to distilled water for 10
minutes and then treated with 2 mol/L HCl at room temperature for 1 hour, followed by neutralization for 5 minutes in 0.1
mol/L sodium borate. Slides were then washed in distilled
water and transferred to a PBS bath, and BrdUrd incorporated
into DNA was detected using a 1:500 dilution of monoclonal
mouse anti-BrdUrd (clone BU33) followed by 1:200 dilution of
anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate antibody (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 1:10 dilution of metal enhanced 3,30 -diaminobenzidine
substrate (Pierce). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted using Permount (Fisher Scientiﬁc). For 3D tissue disks, the CD31 staining was skipped and a
ﬂuorescent secondary, anti-mouse Alexa 546 was used to
detect the BrdUrd primary. Tissue disks were stained with
Hoechst 33342 to label cell nuclei.
Image acquisition
The imaging system consisted of a robotic ﬂuorescence
microscope (Zeiss Imager Z1), a cooled, monochrome CCD
camera (Retiga 4000R; Q Imaging), a motorized slide loader
and x-y stage (Ludl Electronic Products) and customized
ImageJ software (public domain program developed at NIH)
running on a Macintosh computer (Apple). The robotic system
allowed for tiling of adjacent microscopic ﬁelds of view of
entire tumor cryosections up to 1 to 2 cm2 captured at a
resolution of 0.75 mm/pixel.
Image analysis of tumor xenografts
Using ImageJ and user-supplied algorithms, images of
DiOC7(3), CD31, BrdUrd, and pimonidazole staining from each
tumor section were overlaid and areas of necrosis and staining
artifacts manually removed. CD31-positive regions were identiﬁed by selecting all pixels 10 SD above the tissue background
levels. CD31-positive regions that were less than 10 mm2 in size
were considered artifacts and automatically removed from the
analysis. BrdUrd-positive staining was identiﬁed by selecting
pixels that were 5 SD above tissue background levels. Measuring the distance from each point in the tissue to the nearest
CD31-positive object and noting whether it was BrdUrd positive or negative was used to determine the relation between
proliferation and distance to the nearest detected blood vessel.
The data were tabulated so as to determine the fraction of
BrdUrd-positive pixels of the total number of pixels found at
each distance to a blood vessel. Pimonidazole staining was
assessed via similar methods, using average signal intensity
rather than the fraction of pixels above threshold.
Image analysis of 3D tissue disks
Using ImageJ and user-supplied algorithms, images of
BrdUrd, pimonidazole, and Hoechst staining from each tissue
section were overlaid and staining artifacts manually removed.

Tissue edges were traced manually and then BrdUrd and
pimonidazole were mapped in relation to distance from tissue
edges. Three tissue sections 5 to 7 mm in length were taken
from each disk.
Statistical analysis
One-way ANOVA tests were done using Prism software
(GraphPad). Signiﬁcance of differences between multiple
groups was compared using a Bonferroni posttest analysis.

Results
Activity-based screen using HCT116 3D tissue disks
identiﬁes that supraphysiologic insulin
supplementation can reverse diffusion-limited
proliferation
The ability of a selection of media supplements to sustain
proliferation on the temporarily closed-off side of 3D tissue
disks was assayed over a 24-hour period. Figure 1F shows
analysis of BrdUrd labeling in tissue located against the
clamped side of the disk, 75 to 150 mm in from the media side.
Prior to being closed off, the clamped side had access to media
and exhibited equal proliferation to the open side. Of the panel
of supplements tested, only the 1% ITS cocktail or 10 mg/mL
insulin alone was found to maintain active S-phase status in
the tissue on the closed side. Ten mg/mL insulin is approximately 100 times greater than physiologic blood concentrations, and at this level, it also acts to efﬁciently stimulate the

IGF-I receptor and downstream AKT/mTOR pathway leading
to proliferation (28–31). Follow-up studies revealed similar
activity after 100 ng/mL LR3-IGF-I stimulation. FBS, glucose,
glutamine, and DNA precursor supplements, uridine and inoline, were not able to sustain proliferation following the 24hour period of closure.
Supraphysiologic insulin in combination with oxygen
supplementation yields greatest increase in
proliferation in HCT116 3D tissue disks
A second screen was carried out to determine the effect of
supplements on cells in the normally quiescent zone of
thicker 3D tissue disks. HCT116 disks were grown to 200
to 300 mm and then, without closing off the disks, normal
growth conditions were supplemented with insulin, glucose,
amino acids, and oxygen (5%, 20%, and 95% O2) for a 24-hour
period. Immunostaining results for S-phase and hypoxic
proﬁles within tissue cryosections are shown in Fig. 2 (also
see Supplementary Data 1 for a comparison with IGF-I
stimulation). Figure 3 summarizes analysis of the interrelation of insulin, oxygen, glucose, and proliferation within the
disks. The maximum depth of proliferation within the disks
was seen to increase with increasing oxygen (Fig. 3A–C),
and stimulation following insulin was more effective at
higher oxygen levels (Fig. 3D–F). Results indicated that
maximal proliferation occurred when both oxygen and
insulin were supplemented. Under combined insulin and
oxygen supplementation, the high level of proliferation of

(Fig. 3H).
Time course of induction of proliferation following LR3IGF-I and oxygen supplementation
In preparation for translation of ﬁndings to tumor xenograft-based studies, work was carried out to look at the time
course of induction of proliferation in quiescent tissue using
LR3-IGF-I, a synthetic analogue of IGF-I which is not bound by
IGF-binding proteins in the blood and remains in an active
form (32, 33). Figure 4 shows the time course of stimulation in
oxygenated regions near the edge of tissue, 0- to 50-mm versus
50- to 100-mm intermediate zones and more hypoxic areas 100
to 150 mm into the tissue. As with previous work using insulin,
direct stimulation of the IGF-I receptor using LR3-IGF-I in
combination with oxygen supplementation was able to initiate
proliferation in normally quiescent areas. Maximal induction
occurred 16 to 24 hours after initiation, at which point overall
tissue proliferation increased 3-  0.4-fold (HCT116) and 4- 
1-fold (HT29), as measured using an S-phase endpoint (BrdUrd
incorporation). Under 5% oxygen, a transient increase in
proliferation occurred predominantly in regions 50 to 100 mm
from the edge of the tissue but not in more hypoxic areas
further inwards. This transient stimulation 8 to 16 hours after
media supplementation explains the increase in disk thickness
seen in Fig. 3H, despite which proliferation levels seemed
normal at 24 hours, as shown in Fig. 3G.

treated under normal versus oxygen and LR3-IGF-I supplemented conditions. Surviving fraction (SF) in chemotherapytreated disks was seen to decrease by approximately 6-fold
under combined stimulation compared with disks under normal conditions (SF 0.71  0.08 reduced to 0.10  0.03). Cell kill
was greater when chemotherapy was given 12 hours after
initiation of stimulation compared with when given simultaneously. Similar results were seen for treated HCT116 disks (SF
0.28  0.1 reduced to 0.046  0.007). The effect of LR3-IGF-I
prestimulation on cell kill for a panel of chemotherapy agents
in disks under 5% O2 is shown in Fig. 5B, in which surviving
fraction is seen to be decreased by 3- to 6-fold.
Effect of LR3-IGF-I and oxygen supplementation on
proliferation status in HCT116 tumor xenografts
LR3-IGF-I stimulation resulted in signiﬁcant induction of
proliferation in HCT116 xenografts, although attempts to
supplement oxygen via pure O2 breathing under normobaric
or hyperbaric conditions were not able to modify tumor
oxygenation status or proliferation levels. Figure 6A shows
proliferation and tissue oxygenation status in relation to tumor
vasculature in HCT116 cryosections. BrdUrd staining, indicating S-phase cells, showed a signiﬁcant increase after 12 hours of
LR3-IGF-I supplementation. In control tumors, proliferation
was seen to cluster around certain vessels whereas other

806

Cancer Res; 72(3) February 1, 2012

vessels exhibited low proliferation, and quiescence rates
gradually increased with distance from vessels. In contrast,
LR3-IGF-I–treated tumors exhibited more consistently high
proliferation rates near all vessels and proliferation tapered
off more abruptly on the border of hypoxic areas. Analysis of
average BrdUrd and pimonidazole staining of viable tissue
regions from whole cryosections (Fig. 6B) indicated that Sphase cells increased by 45% (from 19%  2% to 27%  5%;
mean  SD, n ¼ 6) in the LR3-IGF-I–treated group compared
with controls. Proliferation and hypoxia proﬁles in relation
to blood vessels following the various strategies to increase
proliferation are shown in Fig. 6C. Attempts to increase
tissue oxygenation via pure oxygen breathing under 1 or 2
atmosphere pressure for the duration of the 12-hour stimulation period, either alone or in combination with LR3-IGFI, were not effective at altering either ﬁnal tissue hypoxia or
proliferation status.
LR3-IGF-I supplementation increases response to
chemotherapy in tumor xenografts
The combination of IGF-I receptor stimulation with
paclitaxel or gemcitabine treatment was assayed in HCT116
and HT29 tumor xenografts. Tumor growth delay following
30 mg/kg paclitaxel (q7  2) in HCT116 xenografts with and
without a 12-hour LR3-IGF-I stimulation is shown in Fig. 7A.
Signiﬁcant increases in the delays in time to reach 3-fold
increase in volume were seen following LR3-IGF-I prestimulation for paclitaxel (48% increase in HCT116) and for gemcitabine (25% increase in HCT116 and 40% in HT29) as compared
with unstimulated mice (Fig. 7B). No signiﬁcant change in
mouse weight was seen between normal mice and stimulated
mice. On its own, LR3-IGF-I stimulation was not seen to alter
tumor growth rates, consistent with the transient nature of the
stimulation period of once per week for a 12-hour period (data
not shown).

Discussion
This study shows that IGF-I receptor stimulation could be
successfully used to increase response to chemotherapy,
though the presence of hypoxic cells within the tumors likely
remains a signiﬁcant barrier to full resensitization of the tissue.
A key to the success shown here seemed to be the determination of the appropriate conditions from studies using the
engineered 3D tissue model which replicated the gradients in
diffusible factors leading to tumor-derived quiescence
(13, 16, 26, 34, 35). HCT116 and HT29 colorectal cell lines were
chosen for this study as examples of related tumor types with
differing levels of contact inhibition. HT29 cells express a 3-fold
higher level of e-cadherin, a driver of contact inhibition of
proliferation (36). HT29 cells have also been shown to be more
resistant than HCT116 cells to strategies that use IGF-I receptor inhibition to control tumor cell growth (37). When grown as
solid tumors, both cell types exhibited regions of chronic
hypoxia in areas 100 to 150 mm from vessels, and both displayed
a reduction in proliferation with distance from blood vessels. A
comparison of these ﬁndings in other cancer types displaying
both differing microenvironmental proﬁles and growth factor

dependencies could help to determine the degree to which
these IGF-I ﬁndings are widely applicable.
The 3D tissue model used here consisted of cancer cells
grown into disks of tissue 30 to 40 cell layers thick to match
typical diffusion distances seen in solid tumors (35, 38). Disks
were grown in stirred media such that physiologic conditions
were maintained on the surfaces of each disk while gradients in
oxygen and nutrients formed with depth into the tissue from
either surface. Under these conditions comparable gradients in
proliferation were seen between the 3D tissue system and
tumor xenografts. The initial screen using 3D-tissue disks
showed that proliferation rates within tissue could be maintained by a combination of oxygen and supraphysiologic

insulin or LR3-IGF-I supplementation. Their combined supplementation was found to reverse tumor-derived quiescence
and resensitize the tissues to a panel of antiproliferative
chemotherapies. Other diffusible molecules such as amino
acids and glucose did not seem to limit proliferation when
physiologic levels were maintained at the surface of the disks.
However, supplementing glucose did increase the maximum
depth that cells could survive to before becoming necrotic.
Translation of in vitro ﬁndings from 3D tissue disks to the
xenograft systems indicated a good correlation between the
2 models. In both cases moderate increases in proliferation
status could be achieved via IGF-I receptor stimulation.
Consistent with published data (39), the 5% oxygen exposure

used for the 3D tissue disks appeared closest to actual tumor
oxygen levels as in both cases pimonidazole staining
increased dramatically 50 to 100 mm into the tissue. The
presence of unmapped blood vessels lying outside of the

tissue section may explain why this increase did not appear
as sharp in the tumors compared with the 3D tissue disks.
These unmapped vessels would act to skew the analysis of
the tissue oxygenation in regions that seemed to be distant
from mapped vessels but are actually close to unmapped
ones. In mice, pure oxygen breathing at 1 and 2 atmospheres
pressure did not alter hypoxia proﬁles or proliferation at the
end of the 12-hour stimulation period. Hence the larger
effects predicted from oxygen supplementation in disks
could not be achieved in the xenografts. Working above 2
atmospheres oxygen was not feasible in mice due to their
low tolerance compared with larger animals for prolonged
exposures to hyperbaric oxygen and induction of pulmonary
toxicity and bradycardia (40, 41).
Our results show that a signiﬁcant resensitization of
quiescent tumor cells to chemotherapy is achievable. A key
step toward the successful translation of these ﬁndings may
lie in follow-up studies to test hyperbaric oxygen strategies
in larger animal models. In addition, the ability to stimulate
proliferation on a repeating schedule may be highly dependant on the duration of activity of the antiproliferative drug
combination that is being used. Hence, further work looking
at a larger panel of drugs and over longer treatment schedules is necessary. Although a quiescent cell induction
strategy has the potential to affect the response of any
cancer, micrometastases might be a good target for future
development as the inherent difﬁculty of their detection
makes them less amenable to curative radiotherapy or
surgery.
