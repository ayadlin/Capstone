ABSTRACT
During the past decade, more than 10 targetable oncogenic driver genes have
been validated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) and ROS1 kinase are two new driver genes implicated in ALK- and ROS1rearranged NSCLC. Inhibition of ALK and ROS1 by crizotinib has been reported to be
highly effective and well tolerated in these patients. However, resistance to crizotinib
emerges years after treatment, and increasing efforts have been made to overcome
this issue. Here, we review the biology of ALK and ROS1 and their roles in cancer
progression. We also summarize the ongoing and completed clinical trials validating
ALK and ROS1 as targets for cancer treatment. In the last section of the review, we
will discuss the molecular mechanisms of crizotinib resistance and focus approaches
to overcome it. This review describes an exciting new area of research and may
provide new insights for targeted cancer therapies.

INTRODUCTION

NSCLC, crizotinib resistance inevitably occurs within
years of treatment [9]. Analogous to resistance to
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors,
crizotinib resistance often occurs as a result of resistant
mutations within the tyrosine kinase domains of ALK
and ROS1 [10]. Preclinical studies using patient-derived
cell lines have indicated that activation of bypass tyrosine
kinase signaling contributes to crizotinib resistance
[11]. Here, we review the discovery and biology of
oncogenic ALK and ROS1 rearrangement and summarize
several pivotal clinical trials that validated crizotinib as
a therapeutic agent for NSCLC. We also focus on the
established and ongoing research on crizotinib resistance.
Finally, we will discuss several promising strategies to
monitor and manage NSCLC patients in the clinic after
crizotinib treatment failure.

The discovery of the transforming echinoderm
microtubule-associated
protein-like
4-anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion gene in lung
cancer in 2007 revealed that ALK is not only a driver
gene for very rare types of hematological cancer but can
also serve as a therapeutic target for non-small cell lung
cancers (NSCLC) [1-4]. ALK is present in approximately
3% to 5% of NSCLC patients, turns approximately
8,000 patients each year in the US alone [5]. A couple
of months after the report of the ALK rearrangement in
NSCLC, scientists identified rearrangement of the ROS1
oncogene in NSCLC [6]. Crizotinib (PF02341066) is a
multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with high clinical
efficiency in NSCLC patients harboring ALK and ROS1
rearrangements [7, 8]. In light of its high efficiency and
safety in phase I and phase II clinical trials, crizotinib
has been granted accelerated approval by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) as a front-line treatment for
advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC.
Despite rapid and dramatic effects, a common
concern of targeted therapy is the development of
resistance. In the case of ALK- and ROS1-rearranged

DISCOVERY OF ONCOGENIC ALK AND
ROS1 FUSION GENES IN NSCLC
ALK is a highly conserved receptor tyrosine kinase
(RTK) and it belongs to the insulin receptor superfamily.
Like other RTKs, ALK is located in the cell membrane and

is comprised of an extracellular ligand-binding domain,
transmembrane domain and intracellular tyrosine kinase
domain. Upon binding to ligands (such as pleiotrophin
and midkine), ALK forms a homodimer, which enables
ALK phosphorylation and protein kinase activation
[12, 13]. ALK signaling has been implicated in central
nervous system development, and its expression is
significantly diminished after birth, except in rare scattered
neural cells, endothelial cells and pericytes in the brain,
suggesting a nervous system-specific distribution pattern
of ALK under physiological conditions [14]. However, a
variety of alterations in the ALK gene such as mutations,
overexpression, amplification, translocations, or other
structural rearrangements have been implicated in human
cancer tumorigenesis [15]. Neuroblastoma is a pediatric
cancer that possesses ALK abnormalities that arise from
gene amplification and activating mutations [16, 17]. Chen
and colleagues reported that ALK amplification together
with MYCN amplification contributes to the tumorigenesis
of neuroblastoma. DNA sequencing further revealed eight
ALK missense mutations in 13 of 215 excised tumors and
8 of 24 neuroblastoma-derived cell lines. These mutations
generate seven different amino acid substitutions at
five different positions [18]. Mutant ALK undergoes
autophosphorylation and has increased kinase activity
(this is known as a kinase activating mutation) compared
to wild-type ALK. Therefore, targeting kinase activating
mutant ALK using a molecular approach is expected to
improve the clinical outcomes of advanced ALK mutant
neuroblastoma [19]. In addition to neuroblastoma, ALK
amplification and mutation are reported in other types of
cancers, including esophageal cancer, inflammatory breast
cancer, colorectal cancer and rhabdomyosarcoma [20-23].
However, the most dominant ALK genomic
alterations in cancer are caused by chromosomal
rearrangement when different fusion partners and their
associated promoter regions fuse the upstream of the
ALK kinase domain leading to constitutive activation
of ALK and the downstream PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk
pathways. The first ALK rearrangement was described
in 1994 in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)
as a t(2;5)(p23;q35) rearrangement that fuses ALK
from chromosome 2 to nucleophosmin (NPM) from
chromosome 5. The NPM-ALK fusion gene consists of the
first four exons of NPM and the exons encoding the whole
entire tyrosine kinase domain of ALK, and it is present in
more than 50% of ALCL patients [1]. Other ALK fusion
patterns, such as tropomyosin 3 (TPM3), TRK-fused
gene (TFG) and tropomyosin 4 (TPM4), have also been
detected. However, ALK rearrangement in NSCLC was
not discovered until 2007 by Hiroyuki Mano’s research
group in Japan [4]. Mano and colleagues created a cDNA
library from a patient with lung adenocarcinoma and
identified a fusion gene consisting of the intracellular
tyrosine kinase domain of ALK and EML4, this fusion
gene was shown to have oncogenic activity in mouse
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

3T3 cells and nude mice. Furthermore, a EML4-ALK
K589M mutant with no kinase activity was incapable of
tumorigenesis. Treatment with the ALK tyrosine kinase
inhibitor WHI-P154 markedly inhibited the growth of
EML4-ALK-transformed Ba/F3 cells [4]. The oncogenic
potential of EML4-ALK in vivo was further highlighted
by the Mano group. In contrast to transgenetic mouse
models driven by other oncogenes that usually develop
tumors around 3 to 6 months after birth, the lung-specific
EML4-ALK transgenetic mice have develop multiple lung
cancer nodules in both lungs without latency after birth,
and inhibition of ALK leads to dramatic tumor regression
in vivo. [24]. A recent study using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
in vivo EML4-ALK engineering in mice also showed that
the mice expressing EML4-ALK were born with lung
cancer, indicating that EML4-ALK is definitely a strong
cancer promoter and a good therapeutic target [25].
In addition to EML4-ALK, other fusion patterns that
have been identified include KIF5B-ALK, KLC1-ALK
and TFG-ALK, and the most common fusion pattern is
EML4-ALK (Table 1). Depending on the proportion of the
EML4 gene that is fused to ALK, more than nine EML4ALK variants have been identified, and all of those ALK
variants show a remarkable response to ALK tyrosine
kinase inhibitors in vitro and in vivo [26, 27] (Figure 1A).
Therefore, the kinase function of ALK is critical for cell
transformation, and ALK fusion proteins are therapeutic
targets for NSCLC (discussed below).
Another insulin receptor superfamily, RTK ROS1
(chromosome 6q22), defines a unique molecular subset
of NSCLC. Unfortunately, very little is known about the
function of wild-type ROS1. Mice lacking ROS1 seem to
be healthy, although males display abnormalities in the
epididymis that prevent normal reproduction [28]. Ligands
for ROS1 have not yet been identified [29]. ROS1 somatic
mutations and focal amplification were reported at a very
low frequency in cancer, and the significance of these
genetic alterations is largely unknown. The first ROS1
fusion protein was discovered in the glioblastoma cell
line U118MG. The fusion gene was formed by a deletion
in chromosome 6 that resulted in fusion of the 3’ region
of ROS1 to the 5’ region of FIG (Table 1). Expression
of the FIG-ROS1 fusion protein results in anchorageindependent growth, foci formation, and tumorigenicity
[30, 31]. In addition, FIG-ROS1, SLC34A2-ROS1, CD74ROS1, EZR-ROS1, TPM3-ROS1 and SDC4-ROS1 and
related variants are recognized as new cancer driver genes
and are associated with sensitivity to ROS1 inhibition [3234] (Table 1). It is estimated that approximately 1% of
NSCLC harbor ROS1 rearrangement [35]. Interestingly,
a recent biochemical study revealed that ROS1 proteins
shares 77% amino acid sequence homology with ALK in
the ATP binding sites of the tyrosine kinase domain; this
leads to the observation that the ALK inhibitors crizotinib
and TAE684 profoundly inhibit ROS1 kinase activity and
lead to tumor regression [36]. The EGFR inhibitor gefitinib

was shown to sensitize ROS1 inhibition in HCC78 cells,
which harbor SLC34A2-ROS1, suggesting that ROS1
might cooperate with EGFR to promote proliferation in
this cell line [37]. In contrast, ROS1 rearrangement was
found to be mutually exclusive to ALK rearrangement
in NSCLC [38]. Although no ROS1 specific tyrosine
kinase inhibitors are currently in clinical trials, crizotinib
and other ALK inhibitors may also have activity against
ROS1. Recently, Pfizer has announced that crizotinib has
received Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA
for the potential treatment of ROS1-rearranged NSCLC.

immunohistochemistry are also feasible for pre-screening
tests before FISH [5, 40, 41]. While a large proportion
of biopsy samples are not suitable for the preparation
of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue for
these detection assays, it is important to note the distinct
clinicopathologic features of ALK- and ROS1-rearranged
patients. Unlike EGFR, the prevalence of ALK- and
ROS1-rearrangement is similar in Caucasians and Asians.
These patients tend to be younger at the time of diagnosis.
ALK and ROS1 alterations are also associated with never
smoking or having a light smoking history, female gender,
and adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell histology and
seem to be mutually exclusive to other oncogenic driver
genes [42-44]. However, recent studies have indicated that
8% of ALK-rearranged NSCLC are also positive for either
an EGFR or k-RAS activating mutation [45-48].
Crizotinib, a potent ATP-competitive type-II
aminopyridine tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits ALK,
has already been approved by the FDA for the treatment
of ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Interestingly, crizotinib was
initially designed to target the c-Met proto-oncoprotein
[49]. A kinase inhibition screening assay showed that
crizotinib inhibited the phosphorylation activities of up to
13 kinases (c-Met, ALK, RON, Axl, Tie-2, TrkA, TrkB,

CRIZOTINIB AS A NEW TREATMENT FOR
ALK- AND ROS1-REARRANGED CANCER
ALK and ROS1 rearrangement are detected
in approximately 5% and 1% of NSCLC patients,
respectively, which constitutes a great number of patients
worldwide. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
with break-apart probes is currently the most effective
diagnostic technology for the detection of chromosomal
rearrangement, and it has been approved for the
detection of ALK rearrangement in clinical settings [39].

Abl, IRK, Lck, Sky, VEGFR2 and PDGFRβ) among
102 kinases tested. Preclinical models of Met-amplified
NSCLC revealed showed that addition of crizotinib
results in regression of xenograft tumors [49-51]. These
findings have prompted clinical trials in patients with Met
amplifications (NCT01121575). Crizotinib also inhibits
proliferation of ALK-rearranged lymphoma cells with
IC50 of approximately 50 nM. In a xenograft model with
H3122 cells (a NSCLC cell line positive for EML4-ALK
variant 1 rearrangement), crizotinib treatment resulted in a
significant tumor regression [52] (Figure 1B). In addition
to crizotinib, GSK1838705A, TAE684, CEP-14083,
AP26113, ASP3026, NMS-E628 and other potent tyrosine
kinase inhibitors that can act against oncogenic ALK are
still under clinical development [53] (Table S1).
The potential clinical benefit of crizotinib in ALKrearranged NSCLC was quickly appreciated after an
open-label, multicenter dose-escalating phase I trial
(PROFILE 1001, NCT00585195) [8]. Of note, patients
were already being enrolled in the dose-escalation phase
of study of crizotinib before the discovery of EML4ALK in 2007 (Table 2). A total of 82 ALK-rearranged
NSCLC patients were enrolled in the PROFILE 1001
trial and treated with crizotinib. Crizotinib was started at
50 mg once daily, and then the dose was escalated. The
crizotinib dosage of 250 mg twice a day was reported
to achieve an overall response rate (ORR) of 57% with
mild manageable adverse effects, and it was defined as
the recommended phase II dose [8]. The updated results
of the PROFILE 1001 trial included a median progression
free survival (PFS) of 9.7 months and estimated overall
survival (OS) at 6 and 12 months of 87.9% and 74.8%,
respectively [54]. The phase II crizotinib trial (PROFILE
1005, NCT00932451) demonstrated an ORR of 60%
with a median PFS of 8.1 months [55]. Furthermore, a
phase III crizotinib trial (PROFILE 1007, NCT00932893)
compared crizotinib with pemetrexed or docetaxel as
single agent chemotherapy regimens in NSCLC patients
who had experienced disease progression after prior
platinum-based chemotherapy and showed that crizotinib
was superior to standard chemotherapy in ALK-rearranged
NSCLC patients, with a higher ORR (65% vs 20%, P <
0.001), longer PFS (7.7 vs 3.0 months, HR = 0.49, P <
0.001) and significant improvement in quality of life
[56]. Additionally, the very recently published PROFILE
1014 study (NCT01154140) demonstrated that crizotinib
was superior to standard first-line pemetrexed-platinum
chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated
advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC. The PFS was 10.9
months in the crizotinib group, which is significantly
longer than the PFS of 7.0 months in the chemotherapy
group (HR = 0.45, P < 0.001). The ORR was 74% in the
crizotinib group compared to 45% in the chemotherapy
group (P < 0.001), and crizotinib was associated with a
greater reduction of lung cancer symptoms and greater
improvement in quality of life [57]. The multi-center
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PROFILE 1029 study evaluating the safety and efficiency
of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged East Asian NSCLC
patients (NCT01639001) is currently ongoing (Table 2).
Unfortunately, OS was similar between the crizotinib
and chemotherapy groups in the PROFILE 1007 and
PROFILE 1014 studies. The striking clinical efficiency
of crizotinib has been tested in other ALK-rearranged
cancers. Preliminary studies showed that ALK-rearranged
advanced ALCL patients who relapsed after standard
chemotherapy have high and durable responses to
crizotinib. The ORR of crizotinib was 90.9% (10 out of
11), and 4 patients achieved a complete response. The
OS and PFS rates at 2 years were 72.7% and 63.7%,
respectively [58]. Shapiro and colleagues described
crizotinib treatment of ALK-rearranged inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) [59]. One IMT patient who
harbored an ALK rearrangement experienced a sustained
partial response to crizotinib, while the ALK-negative
IMT patient had no response. This suggests that the ALKrearranged IMT was addicted to ALK-mediated signaling,
making it a potential therapeutic target for this unique
molecular subtype of soft tissue tumors (NCT00585195).
Fortuitously, crizotinib is also a potent ROS1
inhibitor. Preliminary results in 14 ROS1-rearranged
NSCLC patients have been very impressive, with an
ORR of 57% and a disease control rate of 79% at 8
weeks [43]. A recently published study also showed
that crizotinib was highly effective in ROS1-rearranged
NSCLC (NCT00585195). That study enrolled a total of
50 advanced ROS1-rearranged NSCLC patients in an
expansion cohort of the PROFILE 1001 trial (Table 2).
Most of the patients had received prior standard therapy,
and they were treated with 250 mg of crizotinib twice a
day during the trial. The following findings of that study
are of particular interest: 3 patients achieved a complete
response, 33 patients achieved a partial response, 9
patients had stable disease and the ORR was 72%.
Crizotinib also had long-lasting clinical benefits, with an
estimated median response duration of 17.6 months and a
median PFS of 19.2 months [7]. The trial was still ongoing
at the time of publication of this review, and the median
OS had not yet been reached. Other kinase inhibitors,
such as AP26113, have been reported to be potent ROS1
inhibitors. A clinical trial of AP26113 in ROS1-rearranged
patients has been planned, and the results of that trial are
eagerly awaited (NCT01449461).
ALK and ROS1 inhibition share several similarities,
such as the time to first response (median 7.9 weeks for
both) and ORR (61% and 72%, respectively), and the
response of cancers to crizotinib were independent of
the specific ALK and ROS1 gene rearrangements they
possessed. One apparent difference between ALK and
ROS1-rearranged NSCLC patients is their PFS with
crizotinib treatment. The average PFS of patients treated
with crizotinib in the PROFILE 1007 and PROFILE
1014 trials was approximately 9.3 months (7.7 and

10.9 months, respectively). In contrast, the estimated
PFS in ROS1-rearranged patients was much longer at
19.2 months, and at the time of data cut-off, half of the
ROS1-rearranged patients were still being followed to
analyze disease progression. Therefore, the duration of
disease control by crizotinib seems to be much longer and
resistance to crizotinib seems to develop much later in
ROS1- than ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients. While the
FDA approval of crizotinib currently only covers ALKrearranged NSCLC, further clinical trials comparing
crizotinib to standard chemotherapy in ROS1-rearranged
patients are warranted.

C1156Y. Ectopic expression of L1196M and C1156Y leads
to resistance to crizotinib in EML4-ALK-transformed Ba/
F3 cells, indicating that these tumor-derived L1196M and
C1156Y mutations decrease the tumor’s sensitivity to
ALK inhibitors [62]. The underlying mechanisms have
been determined to a large extent. Similar to the T790M
mutation in EGFR, the “gatekeeper” L1196M mutation
adds new bulky residues to the ATP binding domain of
ALK kinase, which hinders crizotinib binding (Figure
2A). Although C1156Y is not a “gatekeeper” mutation,
it also causes the dislocation between crizotinib and
ALK and indirectly leads to conformational changes in
the binding cavity of ALK, which results in a marked
decrease in crizotinib sensitivity [63]. However, one
large difference between EGFR resistance and ALK
resistance is that multiple resistance mutations have
only been detected in ALK inhibitor resistant patients.
In addition to L1196M and C1156Y, G1202R, S1206Y,
F1174C, F1174L, D1203N, I1171T, 1151T-ins, L1152P
and G1269A mutations also confer crizotinib resistance [9,
64, 65]. To date, resistance mutations have been identified
in approximately 25% patients who failed on crizotinib
treatment. In 2013, resistance to crizotinib caused by
mutation was also reported in ROS1-rearranged patients.
Repeated biopsy specimens revealed a G2032R mutation
within ROS1, which was not detected in the pretreatment
specimen. After the patient died, the autopsy results
showed that all sites of disease had the G2032R mutation,
suggesting that the expansion and spread of G2032R
clones may have been responsible for crizotinib resistance

ALK/ROS1-DOMINANT CRIZOTINIB
RESISTANCE
Although most ALK- and ROS1-rearranged
NSCLC patients benefit substantially from crizotinib,
resistance to targeted therapy remains to be a common
clinical challenge. Resistance to EGFR inhibitors occurs
with the emergence of the “gatekeeper” T790M mutation
within the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; analogously
resistance to crizotinib partially arises from the emergence
of resistance mutations. T790M is present in one-half
of EGFR targeted resistant cases, and it is the most
commonly observed EGFR resistance mutation [60, 61].
The first ALK-rearranged NSCLC patient who relapsed
after crizotinib treatment was described in 2010. DNA
deep sequencing of a pleural effusion specimen from that
patient identified two additional mutations, L1196M and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in this patient. Unlike “gatekeeper” mutations in EGFR
and ALK, the G2032R mutation was located in the solvent
front of the ROS1 kinase domain and was analogous to the
G1202R resistance mutation in ALK [10, 66].
The above-mentioned resistance mutations
sometimes occur simultaneously with gene copy number
gain (CNG). H3122 CR0.6 cells, which are partially
resistant to crizotinib, only harbor the EML4-ALK CNG,
while the fully resistant cell line H3122 CR harbors
both the CNG and L1196M mutation, suggesting a
stepwise evolution of crizotinib resistance involving gene
amplification followed by mutation [67]. Fortunately,
H3122 CR cells are still addicted to ALK signaling and are
sensitive to ALK inhibition by molecular approaches, such
as siRNA. Thus, resistance to crizotinib driven by CNG
and additional mutations was defined as the ALK/ROS1dominant resistance mechanism [67]. Several second
generation ALK inhibitors have been developed and are
entering clinical trials. Ceritinib, also called LDK378, is
one such next generation ALK inhibitor. Unlike crizotinib,
ceritinib selectively inhibits ALK without acting on
c-Met. Ceritinib also inhibits ALK resistance mutations
[68]. Preclinical studies showed remarkable activity of
ceritinib against L1196M, G1269A, S1206Y and I1171T;
however, it had less activity against C1156Y, G1202R,
1151T-ins, L1152P, and F1174C. In crizotinib resistant
xenograft models and patient-derived cell lines, ceritinib
was found to be 20-fold more efficient than crizotinib [69].
Computationally molecular dynamics and crystal structure
analysis revealed that ceritinib showed increased potency
against these resistant mutations [70]. A phase I doseescalation trial showed that ceritinib has high efficiency in
ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients regardless of whether
they were previously treated with crizotinib. For 114
ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients who received at least
400 mg of ceritinib per day, the ORR was 58% and the
median PFS was 7.0 months. Responses to ceritinib were
also observed in patients with various ALK resistance
mutations, suggesting that sequential treatment with
ceritinib is a feasible method for overcoming crizotinib
resistance (NCT01283516) [71]. Moreover, sequential
crizotinib and ceritinib treatment has been shown to
extend PFS (15.5-19.4 months) and OS (35.5-63.1
months) in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients (n = 73)
(NCT01283516) [72]. Another encouraging property for
ceritinib is its intracranial efficacy [73]. An ORR of 54%
and a median PFS of 6.9 months was achieved in 124 brain
metastatic ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients treated with
ceritinib at the recommended dosage of 750 mg per day.
Among the 14 patients with measurable brain lesions at
baseline (10 crizotinib-pretreated and 4 crizotinib-naïve),
ceritinib treatment achieved an intracranial ORR of 50%
in all patients, 40% in crizotinib-pretreated patients and
75% in crizotinib-naïve patients [74]. Therefore, ceritinib
was granted accelerated approval by the US FDA in 2013
for the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for NSCLC patients who failed on or are intolerant to
crizotinib [75]. Other second generation ALK inhibitors,
including alectinib/CH5424802, ASP3026 and AP26113,
are under clinical development in ALK-rearranged patients
[53].
Ceritinib, ASP3026 and AP26113 also exhibit
activity against ROS1 kinase, but alectinib does not [53].
However, ceritinib, ASP3026 and AP26113 fail to inhibit
crizotinib-resistant ROS1, and more potent ROS1 tyrosine
kinase inhibitors are urgently needed. The multi-targeted
tyrosine kinase inhibitors foretinib and cabozantinib
exhibit more than 50-fold inhibition potency compared
with crizotinib in ROS1-transformed Ba/F3 cells.
Crizotinib-resistant G2032R mutants remain sensitive to
foretinib and cabozantinib [76, 77]. More recently, PF06463922 was reported to be the most potent ALK/ROS1
inhibitor with exquisite potency against ROS1 kinase.
PF-06463922 is 10-fold more potent than crizotinib and
foretinib and 100-fold more potent than ceritinib and
alectinib in inhibition of both ROS1-addicted cell growth
and ROS1 kinase activity. It inhibits cell proliferation
and induces apoptosis in HCC78 cells harboring the
SLC34A2-ROS1 rearrangement and in CD74-ROS1transformed Ba/F3 cells at concentrations less than 1
nM. In Ba/F3 cells engineered to express the crizotinib
L2026M “gatekeeper” and G2032R resistance mutations,
PF-06463922 demonstrated nanomolar potency against
both mutations in vitro and in vivo [78, 79] (Table S1).
In addition, PF-06463922 is able to penetrate the bloodbrain-barrier, and oral administration was found to be
effective in a mouse model of ROS1-driven malignant
glioma [80]. A phase I/II trial studying the safety and
efficacy of PF-06463922 in ALK/ROS1-rearranged
NSCLC was launched in January 2014; the trial will be
complete in October 2017 (NCT01970865).

ALK/ROS1 NON-DOMINANT CRIZOTINIB
RESISTANCE
A growing number of studies suggest that resistance
to targeted therapeutics is associated with reactivation of
key downstream signaling pathways that are independent
of the original oncogenic driver genes. This type of
resistance model was initially described in EGFR mutant
NSCLC, in which Met amplification reactivates PI3K/
Akt and MAPK/Erk signals despite EGFR inhibition
through the formation of Met-ErbB3 heterodimers.
Treatment with a combination of EGFR and Met inhibitors
efficiently diminished the constitutively activated PI3K/
Akt and MAPK/Erk signals and overcame the resistance to
gefitinib [81]. Clarification of such resistance mechanisms
is expected to improve the prognosis of ALK- and ROS1arranged patients. Sasaki and colleagues reported that
H3122 TR3 cells, which are resistant to the ALK inhibitor
TAE684, have a reduced ALK phosphorylation level in
comparison with H3122 parental cells. They also found
12296

Oncotarget

that H3122 TR3 cells secrete a greater amount of EGFR
ligands, which leads to increased autophosphorylation
of EGFR that cannot be inhibited by TAE684. Inhibition
of EGFR signaling led to a significant decrease in
proliferation and colony formation of H3122 TR3 cells,
but not H3122 cells. Additionally, treatment with a
combination of EGFR and ALK inhibitors led to complete
inhibition of colony formation [82, 83]. More strikingly,
increased EGFR phosphorylation was detected in 44% of
ALK-rearranged crizotinib-resistant patients and in ROS1rearranged crizotinib-resistant tumors, indicating that
this mechanism may mediate resistance in some patients
[11, 84]. Amplification of c-kit kinase also leads to
crizotinib resistance. c-kit amplification has been detected
in approximately 15% of crizotinib-resistant samples,
and combining crizotinib with imatinib overcomes this
resistance [11] (Figure 2B). More interestingly, RAS
mutations have been shown to cause crizotinib resistance
in both ALK- and ROS1-rearranged patients [85]. These
results indicate that the cancer cells may have evolved
to switch their dependence for survival from the original
oncogeneic drivers ALK and ROS1 to other oncogenic
drivers, including EGFR, kit and RAS. As the downstream
PI3K/Akt and MAPK/Erk pathways can be reactivated
despite ALK/ROS1 inhibition, a combinatorial treatment
strategy that acts against these pathways may help to
overcome resistance in ALK/ROS1 non-dominant settings.
One of the major concerns is to clearly identify the
precious bypass oncogenic drivers that drive resistance in
an individual patient. The preclinical resistant cell model
has been extensively described. However, lack of cancer
heterogeneity (high homogeneity of established parental
cell lines) and defects in the microenvironment (absence
of surrounding capillaries, immune cells, stromal cells,
extracellular matrix, etc.) with this model are major
concerns that limit the ability to translate laboratory
findings directly into clinical applications. Therefore, there
is an urgent need for more effective methods to identify
specific bypass tracks responsible for promoting resistance
in individual patients. In recent years, the patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) model has emerged as a powerful tool
for translational research, and it promises to enable a more
personalized approach to patient care [86]. PDXs have
significant similarities to their tumors of origin and are
physiologically relevant to human cancers, making them
ideal for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic agents
in vivo. Using the patient-derived model, the Engelman
group recently described a combination strategy to predict
resistance drivers and overcome resistance to targeted
therapies [87]. For example, patient-derived MGH1701BB cells, which are resistant to EGFR inhibitors, were
solely responsive to a combination of EGFR and Met
inhibitors among a panel of 76 targeted agents tested,
suggesting that Met emerged as the resistance driver in
this patient. Indeed, subsequent assessment of the patient
biopsy specimen and MGH170-1BB cells has confirmed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the presence of Met amplification. The MGH156-1A cells
derived from another EGFR inhibitor-resistant patient
were responsive to a combination of EGFR and fibroblast
growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitors; genetic analysis
of MGH156-1A cells and the corresponding specimen
revealed a Y649C mutation in the FGFR3 tyrosine kinase
domain. The combined use of a MAP kinase inhibitor
and ALK inhibitor resulted in robust tumor regression in
the ceritinib-resistant PDX. Next generation sequencing
of the patient-derived MGH034-2A cells revealed a
MAP2K1 K57N activating mutation, which underlies
the remarkable response of the MGH034-2A cells and
the PDX to simultaneous inhibition of ALK and MAP
kinase [87]. Therefore, functional assessment of patientderived models helps to identify resistance drivers. Using
a combination screening strategy is a feasible method to
predict resistance drivers and identify the most effective
combination treatment for each patient.

HSP90 INHIBITORS AS A POTENT
TREATMENT STRATEGY FOR ALKPOSITIVE NSCLC
Finally, another promising approach to treat ALKrearranged NSCLC is the use of heat shock protein 90
(Hsp90) inhibitors. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that
facilitates protein folding, maturation and stabilization.
Inhibition of Hsp90 disrupts protein stability and leads
to degradation of proteins, including the oncogenic ALK
fusion protein [88, 89]. Hsp90 inhibitors have been
shown to have single-agent activity in ALK-rearranged
NSCLC xenografts. Phase 2 trials have shown that
retaspimycin hydrochloride (IPI-504), ganetespib (STA9090) and AUY922 have Hsp90 inhibitory activity in
ALK-rearranged NSCLC (Table S1). The IPI-504 study
recruited 76 patients who failed on EGFR inhibitor
therapy, and 5 patients demonstrated a PR to IPI-504.
Of note, 3 patients harbored an ALK rearrangement, 2
of whom had a PR and one of whom had stable disease.
The estimated PFS for all the patients was 2.9 months,
whereas the PFS of the 3 ALK-rearranged patients was
7 months [90, 91]. Similarly, the ganetespib study was
not initially designed to evaluate the efficacy in ALKrearranged patients, but the post-hoc analysis showed that
a substantial proportion of ALK-rearranged patients had a
PR, which was not observed in the patients with EGFR and
RAS genotypes [92, 93]. Preliminary data from the phase
2 AUY922 trial showed an ORR of 29% (6 out of 21)
in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Of the 6 responders, 4 were
crizotinib-naïve and 2 had previously been treated with
crizotinib. The estimated median PFS rate was 42% at 18
weeks [94]. More strikingly, a preclinical study revealed
the crizotinib-resistant L1196M and F1174L mutants were
equally sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors as cancers without
those secondary mutations, and synergistic effects were
observed when crizotinib was combined with Hsp90
12297

Oncotarget

inhibitors in ALK- and Met-driven cancers [67, 91]. Thus,
the use of Hsp90 inhibitors is an optimal therapeutic
strategy for ALK-rearranged NSCLC and a promising
approach for overcoming crizotinib resistance. Multiple
clinical studies of Hsp90 inhibitors as a single-agent or in
combination with crizotinib or ceritinib in crizotinib-naïve
ALK-rearranged, crizotinib-resistant cancers are underway
(NCT01579994, NCT01712217, and NCT01772797).

9 GR) cells through chronic exposure to gefitinib and
isolated a panel of resistant clones. Direct sequencing
and amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)
assay showed that only half of the resistant clones had the
T790M resistance mutation, indicating that some resistant
clones may evade apoptosis through T790M-independent
mechanisms [99]. In support of this notion, we generated
PC-9 GR cells in our lab that did not have the T790M
resistance mutation, and xenograft histology and
immunohistochemistry showed that the cells underwent
small cell lung cancer transformation. The PC-9 GR
cells in our lab also underwent epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (unpublished data), which reflects cancer
heterogeneity during resistance to targeted therapeutics.
Moreover, using more sensitive methodology, cells with
T790M and Met amplification were found to preexist as
minor clones in EGFR-mutant NSCLC [100]. It is highly
likely that ALK/ROS1-dominant and non-dominant
resistant cells preexist in crizotinib-naïve patients as a
result of cancer heterogeneity, which would mean that the
so-called acquired resistance is not actually “acquired”
during treatment but is merely an outgrowth of preexisting
clones under drug selection. If this is the case, it would
have substantial clinical implications, as there would be
feasible methods (such as repeat biopsy and non-invasive
liquid biopsy) that could be implemented during the time
course of the disease to choose the most appropriate
targeted therapeutic agents.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
Extensive translational studies have demonstrated
that lung cancer is no longer a single disease, and the
“all-in-one-way” approach is no longer applicable.
To date, more than ten cancer driver genes have been
identified in lung adenocarcinoma. Therapeutic targets
in lung squamous cell carcinoma, including fibroblast
growth factor receptor (FGFR) and discoidin domain
receptor 2 (DDR2), are currently being investigated [9598]. However, the exact molecular drivers in nearly 50%
of NSCLC patients have not been identified, and not all
drivers can be targeted. For cases that the exact oncogenic
drivers are not known, standard chemotherapy remains the
foundation of treatment. However, The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) analysis and next generation sequencing
(NGS) may help to determine potential cancer drivers,
and the PDX model can be applied to determine the best
combination strategy for each patient.
In addition to the roles of ALK and ROS1 in
NSCLC, their roles in other solid tumors have attracted
increasing attention, indicating that one genomic alteration
may be responsible for a wide range of cancers (known
as pan-cancers). Furthermore, the similarities across
different cancer types offers the possibility of repurposing
targeted therapies directed by the molecular pathology
of the cancer in addition to clinical classification (Table
1). The innovative ongoing Basket trial (NCT01121588)
is evaluating the safety and activity of crizotinib in
ALK-rearranged pan-cancers (also termed ALKoma).
Reclassifying cancers based on genetic characters beyond
tissue origination, such as EGFRoma, ALKoma and
ROSoma, is promising, and these cancers could be treated
with corresponding tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including
gefitinib and crizotinib.
The origination of resistance mutations and bypass
signaling pathways during the development of targeted
therapy resistance are yet to be fully elucidated; however,
several lines of evidence suggest that cancer heterogeneity
is one of the driving forces. There is general consensusly
agreed that the established parental cell lines are highly
homologous; however, the derivative resistant cells are
believed to be heterogeneous. For example, the lung
adenocarcinoma PC-9 cells harboring the EGFR del
E746_A750 activating mutation and are frequently
used in studies of EGFR- targeted therapy. Zhang and
colleagues generated PC-9 gefitinib- resistant (PCwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
