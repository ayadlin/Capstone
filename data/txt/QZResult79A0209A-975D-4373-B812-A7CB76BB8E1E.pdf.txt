Abstract
Failure of chemotherapy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer is often due to resistance to therapy-induced
apoptosis. A major mechanism for such resistance is the expression and activity of inhibitors of apoptosis
proteins (IAP). Smac (second mitochondria–derived activator of caspase) is a mitochondrial protein that
inhibits IAPs. We show that JP1201, a Smac mimetic, is a potent enhancer of chemotherapy in robust mouse
models of pancreatic cancer. Combination of JP1201 with gemcitabine reduced primary and metastatic tumor
burden in orthotopic xenograft and syngenic tumor models, induced regression of established tumors, and
prolonged survival in xenograft and transgenic models of pancreatic cancer. The effect of JP1201 was phenocopied by XIAP small interfering RNA in vitro and correlated with elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor
α protein in vivo. The continued development of JP1201 and other strategies designed to enhance therapyinduced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer is warranted. Cancer Res; 70(7); 2852–61. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease with a dismal 5-year
survival (1). Surgery offers a chance for a cure; however, most patients have advanced disease, are not candidates for resection,
and must rely on chemotherapy. Resistance to chemotherapyinduced apoptosis is a significant factor contributing to poor
prognosis of these patients (2). Tumor cells often circumvent the
apoptotic cascade and proliferate in the face of apoptotic stimuli,
which facilitates tumor progression and metastasis (3). Thus,
restoring apoptotic response in tumor cells is an attractive strategy to improve the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients (2).
Two major pathways induce apoptosis: the extrinsic or
death receptor–mediated pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway (4). The extrinsic pathway is activated by
the binding of molecules such as tumor necrosis factor α
(TNFα)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or TNFα
to their cognate receptors (3). Members of the TNF receptor
superfamily induce apoptosis by recruitment of FADD and
formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (5). The
intrinsic pathway is initiated when cellular stress causes a change

in mitochondrial membrane permeability, which releases proteins such as cytochrome c and second mitochondria–derived
activator of caspase (Smac), resulting in the recruitment of
Apaf-1 and formation of the apoptosome (4). Executioner
caspases are activated by both pathways, resulting in subsequent cell death (5).
Chemotherapy and radiation ultimately cause tumor cell
death by inducing apoptosis (5), which is compromised by
tumor cell resistance to apoptosis (2). Many cancer cells express elevated levels of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP)
and escape apoptosis through the activity of IAPs (4). IAPs prevent the activation of caspases and, as such, block the extrinsic
and intrinsic apoptotic cascades (5). X-linked IAP (XIAP) is
one of the best characterized IAPs and is expressed at a higher
level in pancreatic cancer cell lines (n = 19; ref. 6) and pancreatic tumors (14 of 18) compared with normal pancreas (7, 8).
XIAP is an attractive target for anticancer therapy as it functions as a “gatekeeper” of caspase activation (4). The mitochondrial protein Smac inhibits IAPs, including XIAP, thus
promoting caspase activation and subsequent cell death. Smac
has been shown to bind to XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2, and Smac
mimetics sensitize tumors to programmed cell death (7, 9–11).
In this series of experiments, we explore the effect of a
novel Smac mimetic, JP1201, in combination with chemotherapy. We show that JP1201 enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy and improves survival in multiple animal models
of pancreatic cancer. These effects are mediated in part by
inhibition of XIAP and induction of TNFα.

were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
The murine pancreatic cancer cell line Pan02 (also known
as Panc02) was obtained from the National Cancer Institute
(NCI). Cell lines were confirmed to be pathogen-free and
human cell lines were authenticated to confirm origin before
use. Cell lines were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained at 37°C in a
humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% air.
In vitro cytotoxicity and drug response assay
Assays were performed in 96-well format as described (12).
Briefly, cells were plated on day 0 and the drug was added
on day 1 in 4-fold dilutions. For gemcitabine (Eli Lilly and Company) alone and the gemcitabine-JP1201 (100 nmol/L) combination, the highest dose of gemcitabine given was 2,000 nmol/L.
For JP1201 alone, the highest concentration given was
100 μmol/L. Relative cell number was determined by adding
MTS (Promega; final concentration, 333 μg/mL), incubating
for 1 to 3 h at 37°C, and reading absorbance at a 490-nm plate
reader (Spectra Max 190, Molecular Devices). Drug sensitivity
curves and IC50 values were calculated using in-house software.
Small interfering RNA and gemcitabine combination
therapy
For reverse transfection, 0.25 μL of 20 μmol/L stock of
each small interfering RNA (siRNA) in a volume of 19.75 μL
of serum-free DMEM was delivered to each well of a 96-well
plate. Dharmafect 1 (0.125 μL; Dharmacon) in 9.875 μL of
serum-free DMEM was then delivered into each well. RNAlipid complexes were allowed to form (20–30 min). Following
incubation, 8,000 cells were added to each well in DMEM
with 5% FBS, with a total volume per well of 100 μL. On
day 1, gemcitabine was added to each plate in DMEM with
5% FBS in 4-fold serial dilutions as described above. Plates
were read on day 5 using a MTS assay as described.
Animal studies
All animals were housed in a pathogen-free facility with
24-h access to food and water. Experiments were approved
by, and performed in accordance with, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas
Southwestern. Athymic nu/nu mice were purchased from
NCI, C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory, and severe combined immunodeficient mice were obtained from an on-campus supplier. At sacrifice, the pancreas
and tumor were excised and weighed en bloc to determine primary tumor burden. Metastases were identified through visual
inspection of the surface of the liver, diaphragm, peritoneal
surfaces, and lymph nodes. Samples were fixed in 10% formalin
(Sigma) or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for further studies.
Early intervention model. Six- to 8-wk-old athymic nu/nu
female mice were injected with MIA PaCa-2 cells (1 × 106) as
described (13). Animals were randomized following tumor
cell injection into treatment groups and therapy was initiated 1 wk following tumor cell injection. Therapy with TRAIL
(20 mg/kg) alone or in combination with JP1201 (0.2, 0.6, 2.0,
and 6.0 mg/kg) was given thrice weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) through the lateral tail vein for a total of six injec-

tions. All drugs were diluted in saline. Animals were sacrificed
2.5 wk after the cessation of therapy.
Late intervention model. On day 28 after tumor cell injection, therapy was initiated and continued for six doses. The
dosing was similar except that JP1201 was only given at
6.0 mg/kg and gemcitabine was dosed at 175 mg/kg on day
28 and at 100 mg/kg on days 30, 37, and 40. A replicate experiment with gemcitabine at 25 mg/kg given six times over 2 wk
was also performed. The animals were sacrificed on day 42, 2 d
following the last treatment.
Syngenic model. Pan02 cells were injected orthotopically into
C57Bl/6 mice, and therapy was initiated on day 21 after tumor
cell injection. Therapy consisted of saline, gemcitabine alone
(25 mg/kg), JP1201 (6.0 mg/kg), and the combination of gemcitabine and JP1201. The schedule of therapy was the same as above.
Survival study. MIA PaCa-2 tumors were established in
nude mice in an identical manner to the late intervention
study. Therapy was given on the same schedule with gemcitabine at 25 mg/kg. Following therapy, animals were weighed
thrice weekly and assessed for weight loss or ascites. Assessment of animals was done by an experienced observer
blinded to the treatment group. Animals were sacrificed for
humane purposes if weight loss was >15% of body weight or
if they had ascites and weight gain of >10%. These animals
were counted as a death on the day of sacrifice.
Transgenic model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
p48-Cre: KrasG12D: Ink4a/Arf lox/lox mice (14, 15) were genotyped shortly after birth, and therapy with saline, gemcitabine
(25 mg/kg), or JP1201 (6 mg/kg) combined with gemcitabine
was delivered by i.p. injection thrice weekly. End point and
survival studies were performed as described above.
Pharmacokinetics. MIA PaCa-2 tumor cells were implanted into the pancreas of athymic nu/nu mice. Forty-one
days later, the animals were placed in groups of three and
given gemcitabine alone (100 mg/kg to 2 mg total, i.p.),
JP1201 alone (6 mg/kg to 0.12 mg total, i.v.), or a combination
of gemcitabine and JP1201. Animals were sacrificed at varying
times after dosing (5 and 30 min, and 2, 8, 12, and 24 h), and
plasma and tumors were sampled. The processing and analytic methods used for the detection of gemcitabine (dFdC),
JP1201, and the gemcitabine inactive metabolite dFdU are
described in detail in the online Supplementary Material.
Histology
Formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned (10 μm) by the Molecular Pathology core at University
of Texas Southwestern Medical School where routine H&E
staining was also performed. Antibodies were used at 5 μg/mL
and included goat anti–proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA;
SC-9857, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-human TNFα
(ab6671, Abcam), and rat anti-mouse TNFα (506302, Biolegend).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).

Results
JP1201 + TRAIL slows the growth of orthotopic
pancreatic tumors
Smac mimetics induce apoptosis in vitro when combined
with TRAIL or TNFα (9). JP1201 did not induce apoptosis in
MIA PaCa-2 as a single agent in vitro; however, addition of
JP1201 decreased the IC50 of TRAIL from 4.5 to 1.2 nmol/L.
We assessed how JP1201 in combination with TRAIL affected
pancreatic cancer growth in vivo. In this early intervention
model, mice bearing MIA PaCa-2 tumors were treated with

saline, TRAIL, or TRAIL + JP1201 at 0.2, 0.6, 2, or 6 mg/kg
starting 1 week following tumor cell injection and sacrificed
2.5 weeks after the last dose of therapy (Fig. 1A). Therapy
with TRAIL + JP1201 at doses of 2 or 6 mg/kg reduced the
final size of pancreatic tumors by ∼50% (control, 0.46 g versus
0.23 and 0.24 g, respectively; Fig. 1B). TRAIL alone had a modest
effect on the size of xenografts compared with saline. Tumors
were removed en bloc. At the time of sacrifice, we observed
significantly less tumor burden and more residual normal pancreas in mice treated with TRAIL + JP1201. Histologic analysis
showed extensive tumor burden in saline-treated animals. In
contrast, mice treated with combination therapy using the
highest doses of JP1201 showed scattered foci of tumor growth
with a large amount of residual normal pancreas (Fig. 1C).

Figure 1. JP1201 in combination with TRAIL is effective in controlling pancreatic tumor xenografts. A, early intervention treatment algorithm. MIA PaCa-2
cells (1 × 106) were injected into mice on day 0. Therapy was initiated on day 7 after tumor cell injection (TCI). Therapy was given by i.v. or i.p.
injection every other day (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for 2 wk on the days indicated. Mice received saline, TRAIL (20 mg/kg), or TRAIL + JP1201
(JP, at 0.2, 0.6, 2.0, or 6.0 mg/kg). Animals were sacrificed 2.5 wk after the last dose of therapy (D36). B, a scatter plot of tumor weights at the time of

visible metastases. The data represent a single animal experiment with seven to nine animals in each treatment group.

NOTE: Cell growth assays were performed in 96-well format for 5 days (n = 8/condition/assay). On day 0, cells were plated; on day
1, drugs were added in 4-fold dilutions. The highest dose of gemcitabine was 2,000 nmol/L. The highest concentration of JP1201
alone was 100 μmol/L. On day 5, the relative cell number was estimated using MTS (Promega; final concentration, 333 μg/mL);
plates were incubated for 1 to 3 h at 37°C and read at 490 nm. Drug sensitivity curves and IC50 values were calculated using inhouse software. The number of independent assay performed and the median gemcitabine IC50 ± SD (nmol/L) for gemcitabine
alone and gemcitabine + JP1201, the fold reduction in gemcitabine IC50 in the presence of JP1201 (100 nmol/L), and sensitivity
to JP1201 alone are displayed. Shaded rows indicate cell lines that were tested in vivo.

In addition to controlling primary tumor burden, metastases were reduced by JP1201 + TRAIL. There were no metastatic
events in the TRAIL + JP1201 (6 mg/kg) group, compared with
15 total metastatic events in control animals (Fig. 1D). These
results show that JP1201 sensitizes pancreatic tumors to
therapy with the death receptor ligand TRAIL. Animals treated
with combination therapy did not display any weight loss
or other signs of systemic toxicity.
Inhibition of XIAP improves sensitivity to gemcitabine
Despite being the standard of care for pancreatic cancer,
gemcitabine is only minimally effective. Blocks in apoptosis,
including overexpression of IAPs, might mediate chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer (16). To determine if JP1201
affected the sensitivity in vitro to gemcitabine, we screened
a panel of cell lines against gemcitabine alone, JP1201 alone,
or the combination (Table 1). We found that in general, a
low dose (100 nmol/L) of JP1201 enhanced the sensitivity
of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine by ∼20-fold.
However, the range of fold reduction was wide, with two
cell lines showing no change in the IC50 of gemcitabine
(Capan-2 and Hs 766T), whereas PANC-1 cells showed a
170-fold reduction.
Because JP1201 binds to and inhibits IAPs, we hypothesized that siRNA-mediated knockdown of IAPs would increase sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine
similar to treatment with JP1201. We found that siRNAmediated knockdown of XIAP but not cIAP1 or cIAP2 sensitized MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 (Fig. 2) cells to treatment with
gemcitabine. The increase in sensitivity was similar to treatment with JP1201 (Fig. 2). These data expand the work in

other pancreatic cancer cell lines (8, 17), which show that resistance to chemotherapy is mediated in part by XIAP.
JP1201 + gemcitabine is efficacious for established
pancreatic tumors
A challenge in treating pancreatic cancer is the fact that
patients typically present at an advanced stage. To more
closely parallel human disease presentation, we performed
a late intervention study. MIA PaCa-2 tumors were grown
for 28 days (tumor burden, ∼500 mg) before the initiation
of therapy. Therapy was given as six doses over 2 weeks. A
cohort of animals from each group was sacrificed 24 hours
after the first dose of therapy (day 29) to acquire tissue for
histologic analysis (see below). The remaining animals were
sacrificed on day 42, 2 days following the end of treatment.
As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment with JP1201 + TRAIL or
gemcitabine reduced tumor weight significantly (***, P <
0.001 versus saline). JP1201 alone also had a significant effect
(*, P < 0.05 versus saline) on pancreatic tumor weight, despite
having little effect as a single agent in vitro.
Comparison of mean tumor weights on day 42 to the mean
weight of tumors harvested on at day 29 (mean of 15 tumors
harvested) shows that animals treated with JP1201 in combination with gemcitabine or TRAIL had reductions in mean
tumor size of ∼50%, whereas mice treated with saline or
gemcitabine had increased mean tumor weight by 150%
and 50%, respectively (Fig. 3B). Treatment with JP1201 alone
caused a cessation of tumor growth. These data strongly suggest that mice treated with combination therapy underwent
tumor regression rather than growth inhibition. To confirm
this robust effect, we performed histologic analysis, which

revealed large poorly differentiated tumor tissue in the
saline- and gemcitabine-treated animals with little evidence
of remaining normal pancreas tissue. However, treatment
with JP1201 alone or in combination with gemcitabine or
TRAIL revealed reduced primary tumor burden and an increase in the amount of residual normal pancreas (dark
purple), as seen by H&E analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1).
A replicate experiment revealed similar results (Fig. 3C). In
the replicate experiment, the dose of gemcitabine was decreased to 25 mg/kg. We also evaluated the response of
orthotopic BxPC-3 tumors using a similar dosing strategy
and found that treatment with JP1201 in combination with
gemcitabine was effective at controlling tumor size (saline,
0.94 g; combination therapy, 0.35 g).
Impaired drug delivery is proposed as a complicating factor in the poor response of pancreatic tumors to standard
therapy. With this in mind, we evaluated the general pharmacokinetic parameters of gemcitabine, its inactive metabolite
dFdU, and JP1201 in mice bearing large orthotopic MIA
PaCa-2 tumors (Supplementary Table S1). Fifty-four mice
with a mean ± SD pancreas/tumor of 0.47 ± 0.2 g were used
for the study. We found that the plasma half-life and area
under the curve of gemcitabine were elevated by combination
with JP1201; however, the their contribution to the dramatic
increase in response in mice treated with combination therapy
is unclear. We also identified a surprisingly long plasma and

tumor half-life of JP1201, 300 to 400 minutes and 900 to
1,000 minutes, respectively.
JP1201 maintains effectiveness as a chemosensitizer in
a syngenic model
To determine if JP1201 + gemcitabine remained effective
in a syngenic model of pancreatic cancer, we performed a
therapy experiment in C57Bl/6 mice using the murine pancreatic cancer cell line Pan02. Therapy was started 3 weeks
after tumor cell injection, and animals were sacrificed on
day 35. The combination of JP1201 + gemcitabine was effective at reducing tumor burden in this fully immunocompetent
model (Fig. 3D). Of note, 5 of 10 mice in the combination
therapy group had no identifiable tumor at the time of necropsy, whereas 100% of the saline-treated mice and mice
treated with single-agent therapy had significant pancreatic
tumor masses. We found in this model that gemcitabine
(25 mg/kg) induced splenomegaly, which was then exacerbated by the combination with JP1201 (spleen weight: saline,
0.11 g; gemcitabine, 0.19 g; JP1201, 0.11 g; JP1201/gemcitabine,
0.25 g).
JP1201 reduces metastatic disease
We assessed metastatic burden in the xenograft late interventions studies and found that overall metastatic incidence
was 55% in the saline-treated animals; this was reduced to 35%,

indicated target or JP1201 (100 nmol/L). Cell viability was
estimated 4 d after initiation of treatment by a MTS assay in
which each condition was replicated eight times. The data
shown are representative of three independent experiments.

there was an acute induction of apoptosis in the tumor following administration of JP1201 combined with gemcitabine.
However, after the full course of therapy, there was no difference in the TUNEL signal between any of the treatment
groups (Fig. 4A). We also evaluated cell proliferation by immunohistochemistry for PCNA. PCNA reactivity was elevated
in the combination (JP1201/gemcitabine) at the early time
point (day 29); however, single-agent and combination therapy
significantly reduced PCNA reactivity at the late time point
(Fig. 4B). Furthermore, cell proliferation in tumors treated
with JP1201 and the combination (JP1201/gemcitabine)

www.aacrjournals.org

were reduced significantly compared with treatment with
gemcitabine alone (Fig. 4B).
TNFα has been implicated in the response to Smac mimetics (18). Therefore, we evaluated the level of TNFα protein in tumors from each group at early (day 29) and late (day
42) time points. TNFα levels were increased modestly by
combination therapy at the early time point, but were elevated dramatically by JP1201 alone or in combination with
gemcitabine at the late time point (Fig. 4C and D). We believe
that the TNFα detected is of human tumor cell origin. Pan02
tumor tissue from controls and animals treated with JP1201
alone or in combination with gemcitabine revealed sparse reactivity with the rabbit anti-TNFα antibody used in Fig. 4
(Supplementary Fig. S2) and a rat anti-mouse TNFα antibody
(data not shown). These results are consistent with PCRbased analysis of Pan02 tumor tissue, which did not show
induction of TNFα (data not shown). Taken together, our
observations suggest that Pan02 cells do not produce
TNFα upon treatment with JP1201 and that the majority of

TNFα staining observed in MIA PaCa-2 xenografts is of

Additionally, we evaluated if TNFα induction was detectable in vitro after treatment with JP1201 or siRNA-mediated

Smac Mimetic Inhibits Pancreatic Tumors

Figure 5. Combination of JP1201 with gemcitabine enhances survival of mice with pancreatic cancer. A, mice bearing established MIA PaCa-2 tumors were
treated using the late intervention protocol described in Fig. 3A. Mice were treated with saline (black line), gemcitabine (GEM, 25 mg/kg; green line),
JP1201 (JP, 6.0 mg/kg; red line), or the combination of JP1201/gemcitabine (blue line) thrice weekly for 2 wk. Animals were monitored and sacrificed
when they showed objective signs of tumor burden or when they appeared moribund (as determined by a blinded observer). Rx, treatment; Ns, not
significant. B, p48-Cre:KRasG12D:Ink4a/Arflox/lox PDAC animals were treated with saline, gemcitabine, or the combination of JP1201/gemcitabine starting
at 4 wk of age. Therapy was delivered i.p. continuously thrice weekly until sacrifice. C, a second cohort of PDAC animals underwent 4 wk of therapy
(saline, n = 5; gemcitabine, n = 4; JP1201/gemcitabine, n = 6) and were sacrificed at 8 wk of age. Tumors were excised and weighed, and a scatter plot
showing mean ± SEM tumor weight is displayed. Compared with control (1.124 ± 0.1135 g), JP1201/gemcitabine significantly reduced tumor growth
(0.3833 ± 0.1492 g). **, P < 0.01. Each panel represents a single animal experiment.

and analyzed for TNFα levels by ELISA. These results show
that during this time frame, a single treatment with JP1201
or knockdown of XIAP does not consistently or robustly
induce TNFα expression in these cell lines.
JP1201 + gemcitabine prolongs survival in mice with
orthotopic pancreatic tumors
Animal models frequently show therapy-induced tumor
growth inhibition, but these drugs often fail to transition to
the clinical setting (19). Although we show tumor regression
in a model of advanced cancer, we investigated if the addition of JP1201 to gemcitabine would improve survival. The
use of objective end points, such as survival, may help to
improve the clinical success of agents validated in animal
models (19). Tumor establishment and dosing schedule were
identical to that in Fig. 3A. Following therapy, animals were
monitored until they met institutional criteria necessitating
human sacrifice. Figure 5A shows that animals bearing
orthotopic MIA PaCa-2 tumors treated with JP1201 and
gemcitabine had improved survival compared with saline
(P < 0.001) or treatment with gemcitabine alone (P < 0.05).
This supports our hypothesis that addition of JP1201 to standard gemcitabine therapy induces tumor regression, leading
to improvement in outcomes, such as survival.
JP1201 + gemcitabine is effective in an aggressive
transgenic model of pancreatic cancer
Improvements in mouse modeling may increase the rate of
successful transition of preclinical compounds into clinical

use. Genetically engineered mouse models represent one
such approach to improve mouse models of human disease.
We used a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic cancer
based on activating mutations of the oncogene Kras and
deletion of the tumor suppressor gene Ink4a (14, 20). Animals
with pancreas-selective activation of Kras and homozygous
deletion of Ink4a develop aggressive disease at ∼6 weeks of
age and die between 8 to 11 weeks after birth. Animals were
genotyped, placed randomly into treatment cohorts (saline,
gemcitabine, or JP1201 + gemcitabine), and therapy was initiated at ∼4 weeks of age. We performed survival (Fig. 5B)
and end point (Fig. 5C) studies. The results show that the combination of JP1201 + gemcitabine is superior to gemcitabine
alone (P < 0.05) in prolonging survival and that combination
therapy significantly reduces tumor burden (P < 0.01) after
4 weeks of therapy.

Discussion
The prognosis for patients with pancreatic cancer is poor
(1). Chemotherapeutic options are limited and the standard
of care, gemcitabine, improves survival only minimally (21).
Resistance to apoptosis is a critical event in tumorigenesis as
it allows for the development of mutations, survival in harsh
conditions, and proliferation in an anchorage-independent
fashion (22). Efforts to increase therapy-induced apoptosis
are appropriate and attractive for cancer chemotherapy
(5, 22). We show that JP1201, a novel Smac mimetic, robustly improves the efficacy of standard chemotherapy in

pancreatic cancer xenografts, syngenic tumors, and spontaneous transgenic tumors in mice. In vitro mechanistic
studies showed that inhibition of XIAP is critical for the
sensitization of MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Although
in vivo treatment with JP1201 resulted in induction of
TNFα, these data suggest that JP1201 promotes apoptosis
through two potential mechanisms that result in enhanced
activity of gemcitabine.
TRAIL is known to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell
lines and is currently being pursued as a potential cancer
therapy. We show here a moderate effect of TRAIL monotherapy in vivo and potent antitumor activity in animals
that were treated with the combination of JP1201 and
TRAIL. This mirrors the in vitro data with MIA PaCa-2
cells. Other studies in glioma (23) and pancreatic cancer
(10) models show that TRAIL alone is ineffective, but
TRAIL combined with inhibition of XIAP can induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth. These studies showed a
reduction in tumor burden and/or an increase in survival,
consistent with the results presented here. Thus, our data
support that Smac mimetics in combination with TRAIL is
a promising anticancer strategy.
Because gemcitabine is the standard of care for pancreatic
cancer, we determined if inhibition of XIAP would sensitize
tumors to gemcitabine therapy. We found that knockdown of
XIAP, but not related IAPs, using siRNA increases sensitivity
to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cell lines. These data expand the work on other pancreatic cancer cell lines, which
shows that resistance to chemotherapy is mediated in part
by XIAP (8, 17). We also show that the sensitization to gemcitabine with XIAP knockdown is strikingly similar to the
sensitization seen with JP1201 in vitro, supporting the concept that JP1201 sensitizes pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine
through inhibition of XIAP.
We also explored whether JP1201 would sensitize tumors
to gemcitabine treatment. We showed a significant decrease
in tumor weights in animals treated with the combination of
JP1201 and gemcitabine compared with saline in a late intervention model in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice. JP1201 sensitization was also evident at
lower doses of gemcitabine. In a separate experiment, this
effect translated into increased survival in tumor-bearing
animals. These data alone are very suggestive that Smac mimetics combined with standard therapy could greatly improve pancreatic cancer patient response to therapy. This
study adds to the growing body of literature that show
the potency of Smac mimetics in combination with various
standards of care, such as a study done in a glioblastoma
model in which Smac mimetics were shown to enhance tumor cell death after irradiation treatment (24). We further
explored the effect of combination therapy in an aggressive
transgenic model of pancreatic cancer and again saw increased survival.
We also found that treatment with JP1201 induced TNFα
in vivo. Previous reports (12, 25, 26) have shown that Smac
mimetic–sensitive cell lines produce TNFα, can be induced
to produce more TNFα after Smac mimetic treatment, and
are dependent on TNFα for Smac mimetic–induced cell

2860

death. However, there are currently no published data indicating that Smac mimetics induce TNFα in resistant cell
lines, such as MIA PaCa-2. Possible explanations the potential of prolonged treatment with JP1201 to induce TNFα production. Alternatively, the in vivo tumor microenvironment
may be required to facilitate TNFα production after treatment with JP1201 or other Smac mimetics. In that regard,
it is worth noting that although the pancreatic cell lines
showed in vitro resistance to JP1201, the xenografts showed
reduction of tumor burden with JP1201 as a monotherapy,
which might be linked to the production of TNFα. These observations suggest that alternative pathways that promote
cell death may be engaged. TNFα expression has been linked
to noncanonical activation of NF-κB as a result of cIAP1/2
degradation (25, 27). NF-κB can in turn stimulate autocrine
expression of TNFα (25, 26, 28, 29), which activates receptorinteracting protein kinase 1 through the TNF receptor and
subsequently induces caspase activation. In support of this,
preliminary studies suggest that NF-κB actively participates
in JP1201-mediated sensitization of pancreatic tumor cells,
as treatment of cells with gemcitabine, JP1201, and an IKK
inhibitor (SC-514) increased the IC50 for gemcitabine 3- to
13-fold compared with JP1201 + gemcitabine (data not
shown). Thus, JP1201 could promote apoptosis by inducing
the degradation of cIAP1/2, resulting in NF-κB activation,
and inhibiting the activity of XIAP; both could potentiate
the efficacy of gemcitabine (30).
In summary, resistance to therapy-induced apoptosis is a
major roadblock in the treatment of patients with pancreatic
cancer. Another significant challenge is the lack of predictive
power of preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. In an effort
to address both of these challenges, we have shown potent
antitumor activity of a unique Smac mimetic in animal models of pancreatic cancer that are robust and clinically relevant. We believe that our data support the development of
agents designed to sensitize pancreatic tumors to apoptosis
and suggest that JP1201 deserves serious consideration for
clinical investigation.
