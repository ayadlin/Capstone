Abstract
Cell signaling plays a central role in the etiology of cancer.
Numerous therapeutics in use or under development target
signaling proteins; however, off-target effects often limit assignment of positive clinical response to the intended target.
As direct measurements of signaling protein activity are not
generally feasible during treatment, there is a need for more
powerful methods to determine if therapeutics inhibit their
targets and when off-target effects occur. We have used the
Bayesian Decomposition algorithm and data on transcriptional regulation to create a novel methodology, Differential Expression for Signaling Determination (DESIDE), for inferring
signaling activity from microarray measurements. We applied
DESIDE to deduce signaling activity in gastrointestinal stromal tumor cell lines treated with the targeted therapeutic imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). We detected the expected reduced
activity in the KIT pathway, as well as unexpected changes in
the p53 pathway. Pursuing these findings, we have determined
that imatinib-induced DNA damage is responsible for the increased activity of p53, identifying a novel off-target activity
for this drug. We then used DESIDE on data from resected,
post-imatinib treatment tumor samples and identified a pattern in these tumors similar to that at late time points in the
cell lines, and this pattern correlated with initial clinical response. The pattern showed increased activity of ETS domain-containing protein Elk-1 and signal transducers and
activators of transcription 3 transcription factors, which are
associated with the growth of side population cells. DESIDE infers the global reprogramming of signaling networks during
treatment, permitting treatment modification that leverages
ongoing drug development efforts, which is crucial for personalized medicine. [Cancer Res 2009;69(23):9125–32]

Introduction
Our present understanding of cancer has shown the importance
of cell signaling processes in etiology and treatment response. As
signaling proteins, including those with gain-of-function and lossof-function mutations, provide a logical target for therapeutic intervention, numerous compounds targeting signaling proteins are

under development (1). The success of imatinib mesylate (IM) in
treating chronic myelogenous leukemia has greatly increased the
hope for targeted therapy and spurred further development of
BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors (2); however, the varying specificity of
the therapeutics and the potential for reprogramming of cell signaling in response to treatment make the discovery of predictive
biomarkers essential for drug development and patient treatment.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are mesenchymal digestive tract tumors (3). The most common primary sites are the
stomach (60–70%; ref. 4), small intestine (25–35%; ref. 5), and colon
and rectum (10%; ref. 6). These tumors contain smooth muscle and
neural elements and are thought to arise from the interstitial cells
of Cajal (7, 8). GISTs are clinically diagnosed by immunohistochemical KIT staining by the CD117 antibody. KIT is a receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) that can initiate RAS and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
signaling. The majority (∼70%) of GISTs possess gain-of-function
mutations in KIT, whereas ∼10% possess gain-of-function mutations in the RTK PDGFRA, with the rest having no such mutations
(wild type; refs. 9, 10). The primary treatment for GIST is surgical
resection; however, high-risk GIST has a high incidence of recurrence (11). Since 2002, IM has become a standard treatment for
patients with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST, with objective
responses or stable disease obtained in >80% of patients (12, 13).
The expected specific targeting of IM to KIT in GIST makes it an
ideal system for developing methods to understand therapeutics
that target cell signaling processes. The desired effect of a signaling
inhibitor, such as IM, is the loss of propagation of an aberrant signal through a pathway. The logical method to measure the effect of
this inhibitor is to look for changes in protein posttranslational
modifications upon treatment, because most signal propagation
involves protein phosphorylation. The ability to make these measurements is presently limited in vivo during treatment. In addition, such measurements target specific proteins, thus losing the
ability to identify off-target effects and unexpected activation of
other signaling processes.
An alternative approach is to use a mature technology capable of global measurements, such as microarrays, to obtain a full
picture of the cellular response. Because transcriptional changes
resulting from activation or suppression of transcriptional regulators are primary end points for many signaling processes, microarrays provide a potential tool for exploring signaling
globally. There are three primary impediments to this approach.
First, the “wiring diagrams” for cell signaling processes are not
fully determined and vary between cell types. Second, the transcriptional response to a signal is convoluted with the responses
to other biological drivers of transcription, with most if not all
genes under the control of multiple transcriptional regulators.
Third, a good statistic for measuring the probability of activity

of a regulator [or transcription factor (TF)] that accounts for the
multiple regulation of genes has not been developed.
Although the wiring diagrams defining cell signaling relationships (protein-protein interactions) are far from complete, several
core pathways affecting disease have been detailed, especially in
cancer studies (1, 14). The determination that these pathways play
critical roles in embryogenesis has led to a substantial knowledge
base for understanding basic signaling (15), and these can be specialized to cells of interest by manual review of the literature (16).
In this way, a core signaling network can be created for a system of
interest, with the critical pathways linked to TFs.
There has been intensive development of analysis methods to
address multiple regulation. Our own work on Bayesian Decomposition (BD) for spectroscopic imaging (17) and later for microarrays (18) was followed by nonnegative matrix factorization for
imaging (19) and later for microarrays (20, 21). Similar approaches
were developed in statistics (22) and machine learning (23). These
methods provide a set of tools for isolating transcriptional responses related to individual TFs or more accurately to sets of
TFs that are active in the same samples in the data, because these
approaches are data driven.
Statistical methods have been developed to look at enhancement of gene sets in microarray data. Initially, hypergeometric
tests were used to determine if a gene set (e.g., a gene ontology
category) was overrepresented in a sample (24). The development
of gene set enrichment analysis (25) allowed the overall ranks of
genes within a set to play a role in the statistic. However, these
methods do not handle multiple regulation or inclusion of uncertainty. As genes vary strongly in the degree of transcriptional regulation, there are order of magnitude differences in the variances
that transcript levels show related to phenotypic response (26). By
including uncertainty levels, this issue can be addressed, as we
have shown in this work.
We present here the results of the novel technique, Differential
Expression for Signaling Determination, for identifying changes in
signaling activity during intervention with targeted therapeutics.
Other modeling approaches to signaling are in use. These include
ordinary differential equation models (27) and reconstruction of
small networks from protein measurements (28) or prior data
(29). In contrast, we wish to estimate changes in signaling on a
larger network and confine our method by assuming the connectivity is known while minimizing the need for a large number of
biochemical constants. In addition, by focusing on downstream effectors of pathways and genome-wide microarray measurements,
we can discover novel signaling activity that is not initially in
the model and is beyond the capability of ordinary differential
equation and proteomics-based methods to discover due to limited coverage. Recent developments in generation of mRNA from
frozen core needle biopsies also suggest that routine clinical pathology can provide our method with the data needed to move into
clinical practice (30).

Materials and Methods
GIST-T1 cell culture and microarray hybridization. GIST-T1 cells
(31) were grown in triplicate cultures and treated with 10 μmol/L IM. Cells
were harvested at nine time points during treatment (details in Supplementary File 1), and total RNA was isolated from the samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Microarrays were processed using standard Agilent
protocols and using RNeasy from Qiagen.
Agilent microarray scanning and data preprocessing. Microarrays
were scanned using an Agilent G2505B Scanner, and Agilent summary files

were preprocessed with R/Bioconductor (version 2.4.1; ref. 32) using the
limma package (version 2.9.13). Standard limma normalization procedures
were performed, providing relative transcript levels for 44,000 probes
across 26 conditions, comprising triplicate measurements at all time points
except at 24 h, where only duplicate measurements were made.
Probes were assigned to Unigene clusters (33), using the ASAP annotation tool (34). At each time point, we combined all probes across the replicate arrays measuring the same Unigene gene, obtaining mean values and
SDs for 20,656 genes. We annotated all genes using TRANSFAC (35) version
2008.4 based on physical evidence of regulation, providing 1,363 genes
linked to TFs. Raw data is provided in the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GSE17018), and the processed data used for analysis are provided in Supplementary File 2.
Estimation of signaling activity. We estimated signaling activity by the
use of BD (see ref. 36 for a statistical or ref. 18 for a biology-focused description of the algorithm), production of a P value from a Z score for each
TF, and linking of signaling pathway activity to TF activity.
We applied BD to identify transcriptional signatures within the data. Our
data matrix, D, comprised 1,363 rows (genes) by 9 columns (time points)
and was factored into two lower dimensional matrices, a P matrix whose
rows provide P patterns, and an A matrix that apportions the behavior of
the genes to these patterns. Mathematically, BD performs a decomposition
using Markov chain Monte Carlo (37) as
p

Di j ¼ ∑ Aip Ppj

ð1Þ

p¼1

where the genes are indexed by i, the conditions by j, and the patterns by p.
As for PCA (38), issues remain in choosing P; however, we used our previously described approach to identify five patterns as suitable (39). We performed three separate runs of BD to address variability and potential lack
of convergence criteria.
For estimating TF activity, we introduced a Z score–based statistic that,
unlike a hypergeometric test, is independent of threshold and uses variance
measures. For each transcriptional regulator, we defined the gene set Gt
with gi ∈ Gt if and only if gi is regulated by the TF t. We then obtain a
statistic for the TF with R known targets,
Zt;p ¼

Arp
1
∑
R r∈Gt σrp

ð2Þ

where r indexes the target gene, t the TF, p the pattern; A is the mean in the
A matrix; and σ is the uncertainty on the mean. This provides a statistic for
the overrepresentation of target genes of a transcriptional regulator in a
pattern, which we converted to a p value through random sample tests
for each transcriptional regulator with more than five known targets. This
provided probability estimates of regulatory activity for 230 regulators in
each pattern.
To link the probability of TF activity to signaling, we created a simplified
model of KIT signaling in GIST, including insulin-like growth factor-I receptor, based on its role in GIST (40, 41). As multiple regulators lie downstream in these pathways, we interpreted the results across the three
varying patterns by visualizing p values. For display, we rescaled the values
such that p < 0.5 → 0–1 for overrepresentation and p < 0.5 → −1–0 for underrepresentation of TF targets.
Comet assays, quantitative reverse transcription–PCR, and western
blots. For the comet assay, GIST-T1 cells were treated with either 10 μmol/L
of IM for 48 h, 4 Gy of γ-irradiation followed by a 2-h recovery, or with IM
followed by irradiation. Standard comet assay protocols were followed to
obtain CometSlides (Trevigen). The DNA was stained with SYBR fluorescent dye and visualized with an immunofluorescent microscope. At least
75 comets were counted for each treatment, and at least three independent
comet assays were carried out. For quantitative reverse transcription–PCR
(qRT-PCR), RNA was isolated from GIST-T1 cell lines at six time points,
reverse transcribed to cDNA, and measured by real-time PCR for three target genes and the endogenous control gene, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). All data were normalized to HPRT expression. For

treatment show a decline with treatment, a transient peak at ∼9 to 18 h, and a rise with treatment beginning at ∼6 h.

immunoblotting, whole-cell extracts were prepared and the proteins were
evaluated as previously described (42).
Tumor samples and analysis. Sixty-three patients with primary or recurrent operable GIST were enrolled onto the Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group (RTOG) 0132 trial from 18 institutions (43). All patients signed informed consents following the Institutional Review Board approval for this
study. Tumor samples were obtained from the surgical specimens obtained
at the time of resection following neoadjuvant/preoperative IM. Fresh-frozen samples were collected from all participating institutions and shipped
to the RTOG tissue bank before evaluation. Total RNA was isolated from
frozen tissue samples using TRIzol reagent according to standard protocols. Due to patients leaving the study and poor RNA quality, only 22 sam-

ples were analyzed by microarray with 21 having initial tumor response
measurements.
BD analysis was performed on the microarray data from the 22 samples. Preprocessing as described above for the cell line data was used to
obtain data for the same 1,363 genes. Using the methodology described
above, we estimated 11 dimensions to fully describe the data. Analysis of
the patterns revealed three with significant correlation with volume of
initial tumor shrinkage. Significant correlation was defined as >1 SD away
from mean correlation with response across all 11 patterns (mean =
−1.4 × 10−3, SD = 0.28). To compare to clinical response, logistic regression was performed on these patterns in terms of initial clinical response,
as defined previously in ref. 44. These patterns were compared for TF

Results
Five transcriptional patterns capture all time-dependent
behavior in imatinib-treated GIST-T1 cells. We created a time
series cell line data set for analysis using the normalized Agilent
data for the IM treatment of GIST-T1 cells. Probes were combined
by Unigene ID, and we retained genes with a known TF in TRANSFAC Professional 2008.4. We analyzed these data of transcript levels for 1,363 genes across nine time points using BD, positing
three to seven patterns. We chose five patterns based on consistency, using methods developed previously (45). We then applied BD
thrice to these data generating 500,000 MCMC samples each time,
obtaining normalized χ2 fits of 19,246, 19,267, and 19,272.
The mean values for each of the three applications of BD for the
five patterns are pictured in Fig. 1. Error bars represent the SD
from the Markov chain sampling for the patterns varying during
IM treatment. Two patterns are basically constant across the time
points. The other three patterns varied with treatment: pattern 1,
decreasing with IM treatment and reaching a low at 24 hours; pat-

tern 2, transiently rising with a peak between 9 and 18 hours; and
pattern 3, rising continuously after 6 hours. For each pattern, there
is a strength of assignment of each gene, together with a SD on
that strength. Although we do not focus on behavior of individual
genes, we validated our microarray measurements by qRT-PCR
measurements at six time points on three well-studied targets of
the TFs of interest (CDC25A, JAK3, and SOCS3) in IM-treated
GIST-T1 cell culture, verifying that the arrays were correctly estimating relative expression levels (Supplementary File 4).
Statistical analysis identifies significant changes in transcription factor activities. To infer the activity of transcriptional
regulators, we generated a Z score for each regulator in TRANSFAC
that had more than five known targets (230 transcriptional regulators). We modified the TRANSFAC list for two TFs of special interest in our network model. For the FOXO family we combined all
members, because there is strong overlap in potential targets (46).
For cAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1), we combined the lists for CREB and CREB1, as these refer to the same
factor. First, a Z score for each gene in each pattern was generated.
Then, the Z score for a regulator was defined as the average Z
score of all targets of the regulator (Eq. 2), and statistical significance was determined by generating Z scores for random sets of
genes from the associated pattern. We performed 500 random

draws, thus permutation testing sets a limit of P ≥ 0.002. Because
the random samples provide a limit for both chance overrepresentation and underrepresentation of targets, comparison of the Z
score to the distribution from random draws provided an indication of increased or decreased activity (Fig. 2).

Figure 4. The results of IM treatment on DNA damage and repair pathway
response in GIST cells. A shows a comet assay to assess DNA damage to
GIST-T1 cells untreated, treated with 10 μmol/L IM for 48 h, treated with 4 Gy of
γ-radiation followed by recovery, or the combination of both. The data across
replicate measurements is summarized in B and confirms the prediction
based on p53 activity that DNA is damaged during IM treatment. To determine
whether DNA damage repair pathways are activated in response to IM-induced
DNA damage, immunoblotting of various pathway components was performed
after either IM treatment or IR exposure followed by recovery (positive control)
for the times indicated (C).

The results for TFs rated significantly greater than expected by
this procedure in two of the three BD analyses for a threshold α =
0.05 are presented in Table 1. The full list for each of the three runs
is presented in Supplementary File 5. We discuss the link to the
signaling network in detail in the next section; however, we note
that a number of key TFs related to signaling processes affected in
cancer are present. ETS domain-containing protein Elk-1 (ELK1),
the downstream effector of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathway, shows an initial decline and then recovery.
The oncogene MYC appears in the pattern declining with IM,
and it is not significantly represented in the pattern that rises later.
The DNA damage response regulator p53 is the strongest detection
in the transient response, although it also shows up in the pattern
that declines initially with IM treatment. Although not included
initially due to having too few known targets, we analyzed p63
and p73 by the same method. Both were significantly upregulated
in the transient pattern, but only p63 was significantly upregulated
in the decreasing pattern.
The transcriptional effectors of the signaling network
respond initially as expected to imatinib treatment. We estimate activity of signaling pathways by looking at the overall
changes of known downstream effectors of pathway activity, as
in Fig. 3, produced with Cytoscape (47). In the square boxes in
this figure, yellow represents TFs with a p value of close to 0 when
testing for overrepresentation of targets in the pattern, whereas blue
represents TFs with a p value of close to 0 when testing for underrepresentation of targets in the pattern. We have rescaled the values
such that p < 0.5 → 0–1 for overrepresentation and p < 0.5 → −1–0 for
underrepresentation. For each of the three patterns varying with IM
treatment, we show the values obtained from each of the three BD
analyses. The top three squares under each regulator are for pattern
1 (declining with IM treatment), the middle three are for pattern 2
(rising transiently with IM treatment), and the bottom three are for
pattern 3 (rising with IM treatment).
In pattern 1, which declines upon treatment with IM (top box),
the effectors of RAS-RAF signaling, ELK1 and MYC, show high activity. FOXO, the directly repressed target of AKT1, shows low activity, whereas the targets, effectively upregulated by AKT1
(through repression of the repressor GSK3B), E2F1, AP-1, and
CREB1, show high activity. Taken as a whole, this is consistent
with identifying pattern 1 as associated with active KIT signaling.
Because pattern 1 declines during IM treatment, this verifies that
the downstream effectors of constituitively activated KIT show declining activity with IM treatment, as expected.
The p53 transcription factor is highly active at 9 to 18 hours
and is responding to unexpected DNA damage. In pattern 2, the
transient response pattern (middle box), p53 shows a strong signal
for activity. The increased activity in p53 suggested a DNA damage
response, and we predicted therefore that IM unexpectedly damages DNA.
To validate our prediction that IM treatment of GIST-T1 cells
leads to DNA damage, we used comet assays on GIST-T1 cells treated with control, IM, radiation, and IM together with radiation, as
shown in Fig. 4A and B. The radiation is known to induce DNA
damage, so it functions as a positive control. The IM treatment
causes a somewhat larger although statistically similar amount
of damage as the radiation treatment, and there is some indication
of increased damage if both IM and radiation are used together,
suggesting possible sensitization of the cells by IM. It is clear that
IM induces DNA damage, as predicted by our analysis from the
microarray data.

Figure 5. The TF responses for tumors
compared with the increasing pattern in
the cell line. The three boxes on top give
the activity estimates for the cell line,
whereas the individual boxes give the
estimates for three of the patterns in
tumors. The top box has a pattern similar to
that of the cell line, except for SP-1 activity.
This pattern correlates with initial clinical
response with p = 0.06. The second and
third patterns do not correspond to cell
line patterns and are anticorrelated and
correlated respectively with initial tumor
response.

To verify that p53 response was generated via DNA damage,
we performed immunoblotting of p-H2AX, p-ATR, p-CHK2, and
p-p53 together with KIT and p-KIT. As shown in Fig. 4C,
the DNA damage response proteins rise following IM treatment
as p-KIT declines, with p-ATR peaking at 6 hours, immediately before our measured p53 transcriptional response. Other components remain phosphorylated, although the transcriptional
response declines.
The GIST-T1 cell line shows increased activity of ELK1 and
signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 within 24
hours of imatinib treatment. In pattern 3, which increases after
∼6 hours (bottom box), we see a return to high activity in ELK1,
although not in MYC nor in coordinated changes in targets of
AKT1 signaling. In addition, signal transducers and activators of
transcription 3 (STAT3) shows increased activity. Interestingly, activity of MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (and
thus, ELK1) and STAT3, coupled to mTOR (FRAP) activation,
which cannot be determined by this technique, have been identified as hallmarks of side population cells (48), which are considered highly enriched for stem cells. To verify the activation, we
performed immunoblotting of p-ELK1 and p-STAT3, which showed
increased phosphorylation beginning at 6 to 12 hours (see Supplementary File 6).
The strength of a pattern in tumors similar to the late time
point pattern in GIST-T1 cells correlates with initial tumor
response. Using BD and positing 11 patterns based on consistency, we analyzed the data from resected IM-treated patient tumors
collected in the RTOG 0132 trial. Three patterns showed significant
correlation with initial tumor shrinkage, defined as at least 1 SD of
correlation away from the mean for all 11 patterns. To determine
clinical significance, we used logistic regression in terms of clinical
initial response as defined in ref. 44. In Fig. 5, the results for these
three patterns are shown together with pattern 3 from the cell line

data (i.e., rising with IM treatment, rising with IM line in Fig. 1,
bottom row in Fig. 3).
The first pattern from the tumor samples is positively correlated
with initial response (r = 0.34, logistic p = 0.06) and is highly similar
to the pattern from the cell line data. The main differences are the
high activity of AP-1 in the tumors compared with the cell line and
slightly weaker activity in SP1 and MYC. Importantly, this pattern
shows high activity in ELK1 and STAT3, as would be expected if
side population cells were forming a significant percentage of harvested cells.
Other patterns for tumors showing correlation with initial
response are not similar to cell line patterns. The second pattern from the tumors shows negative correlation (r = −0.36, logistic
p = 0.17) with initial response, whereas the third pattern shows
positive correlation (r = 0.52, logistic p = 0.09). Neither shows
strong consistency with any cell line pattern. The second pattern
shows significantly lower activity in SP1 and E2F1, with no heightened activity from ELK1 or STAT3. The third pattern shows little
activity of any of the transcriptional effectors of the network, and it
likely represents a behavior unrelated to these signaling processes.
Plots of pattern strength against clinical response are shown in
Supplementary File 7.

Discussion
Cell signaling processes have been implicated in human disease etiology, and signaling proteins and their interactions have
become targets of therapeutic development. Presently, there are
hundreds of compounds in development, and high-throughput
searches for inhibitors of kinases, which often function in signaling pathways, are being undertaken (49). In vivo these compounds often hit multiple targets and sometimes do not affect
the intended target, either due to mutations in those targets or
delivery and competitive binding issues. This makes development

of methods to identify targets of new molecular medicines essential for drug development, personalized treatment, and development of combination therapies that can hit multiple pathways
simultaneously.
We have shown here the ability to use BD coupled to a novel
metric of enrichment of known transcriptional targets to infer
pathway activity that drives changes in the activity levels of transcriptional regulators. As these are often the primary effectors of
signaling processes, this approach allows us to infer when inhibitors have had the desired effect, turning off a pathway. With this
approach, we have shown that IM downregulates constituitively
activated KIT in GIST-T1 cells, including its downstream transcriptional effectors. Importantly, because we have used a global measure of transcriptional response, we have also identified
unexpected changes in signaling, including increased activity of
p53 after 9 to 18 hours of IM treatment. We predicted that this
increased activity was due to unexpected DNA damage from IM,
and we confirmed this by comet assay and immunoblotting.
In the late time points, increased activity of STAT3 and ELK1
appears, two hallmarks of side population cells enriched for cancer
stem cells. The third hallmark, upregulation of mTOR, cannot be
detected by our method. The MYC TF does not show a return to
high activity at late time points, which may be due to continued
suppression by the ongoing IM treatment. We also analyzed resected tumors from patients receiving presurgical IM treatment
to reduce tumor volume. We identified within these patients a pattern that is similar to this cell line pattern and that correlates with
initial clinical response during IM treatment. Although the analysis
did not reach standard statistical significance, this likely reflects
the very small sample size of postsurgical specimens. Importantly
the pattern includes increased activity of STAT3 and ELK1. This
suggests that tumors may respond well to initial treatment, but
that a reserve population of stem-like cells may then become active. This could explain the lack of correlation between initial tumor response and long-term progression-free survival observed in
RTOG 0132. We identified additional patterns that showed correlation with initial tumor shrinkage although poorer correlation
with initial clinical response, including one pattern that showed
very little increase or decrease in TF activity related to the core
signaling pathways.

The lack of an ability to determine mTOR activity here highlights the desirability of having multiple types of measurements
available in systems under study. Although we could look for side
population cells using targeted proteomics, that would only give a
partial picture. Measurements on the transcriptional regulators
through their targets by microarrays can provide information
on whether signals have been modified downstream of the protein whose state is measured directly. Overall, this suggests an
ideal study might be a mixture of targeted experiments to test
specific hypotheses and global measurements to identify unexpected behaviors.
Although we have used information from TRANSFAC to drive
our statistical analysis, this approach is also promising for inferring
regulation that is not yet identified in TRANSFAC or which contradicts such information. As transcriptional regulation of any gene is
likely to be context specific (e.g., cell line, present state of a cell,
etc.; ref. 50), we can use inconsistencies in prior information from
TRANSFAC to refine our knowledge of transcriptional regulation in
specific cases. This should lead directly to an ability to tailor treatments to specific individuals based on the signaling activity in individual tumors.
