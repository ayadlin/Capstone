Abstract
With recent approval of the ﬁrst dendritic cell (DC) vaccine for patient use, many other DC vaccine approaches
are now being tested in clinical trials. Many of these DC vaccines employ tumor cell lysates (TL) generated from
cells cultured in atmospheric oxygen (20% O2) that greatly exceeds levels found in tumors in situ. In this study,
we tested the hypothesis that TLs generated from tumor cells cultured under physiologic oxygen (5% O2) would
be more effective as a source for DC antigens. Gene expression patterns in primary glioma cultures established at
5% O2 more closely paralleled patient tumors in situ and known immunogenic antigens were more highly
expressed. DCs treated with TLs generated from primary tumor cells maintained in 5% O2 took up and presented
antigens to CD8 T cells more efﬁciently. Moreover, CD8 T cells primed in this manner exhibited superior
tumoricidal activity against target cells cultured in either atmospheric 20% O2 or physiologic 5% O2. Together,
these results establish a simple method to greatly improve the effectiveness of DC vaccines in stimulating the
production of tumoricidal T cells, with broad implications for many of the DC-based cancer vaccines being
developed for clinical application. Cancer Res; 71(21); 6583–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Therapeutic vaccination utilizing dendritic cells (DC) pulsed
with tumor-associated antigens is a promising approach for
cancer immunotherapy (1). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved a peptide-pulsed DC vaccine for
the treatment of prostate cancers resistant to hormone ablation (2, 3). Tumor cells are frequently used as a source of
antigen for DC-based vaccines. There are 385 clinical trials
currently registered that utilize tumor cells as the source of
vaccine antigen (4). Vaccines using tumor cells and tumor cell
lysates (TL) have several advantages including targeting multiple, patient-speciﬁc tumor antigens. Vaccination with TLpulsed DCs has shown encouraging results in early-stage
clinical trials in numerous malignancies, but there is clearly
a need for additional improvement (5).
It remains unclear how tissue culture might affect antitumor
immune responses evoked by tumor cell vaccines. Primary

human glioma cells cultured in serum-containing media were
genetically and phenotypically different from the primary
tumor; culture of the same cells in serum-free conditions more
closely reﬂected the primary tumor and enriched for a tumor
stem cell phenotype (6). Moreover, in a murine model, glioma
cell lysates generated in serum-free conditions were more
effective than those derived from serum-containing media
when employed for TL-pulsed DC vaccines (7). Traditionally,
tumor cell vaccines are derived from cultures maintained at
atmospheric oxygen (20.95%; hereafter 20% O2), far from the
average oxygen tension of less than 6% O2 (range, 0.1%–10%)
measured in glioblastoma in situ (8). Lowering oxygen causes
alterations in gene expression, cell metabolism, proliferation,
survival (9–12), and increases the expression of tumor stem cell
markers CD133, Nestin, and SOX2 (13–15). We previously
showed that glioma and breast carcinoma TL vaccines derived
at 5% O2 had superior therapeutic efﬁcacy relative to 20% O2 in
murine models. However, this previous study did not address
DC vaccines and it remained uncertain if the results would
translate to stimulating human leukocytes using primary
human tumors, which are often heterogeneous and unpredictable. We therefore investigated the mechanisms by which
oxygen may change the immunogenicity of serum-free glioma
cultures derived from glioblastoma patient surgical resections.

Materials and Methods
Glioma cell culture and lysates
Surgically resected glioblastomas (Supplementary Table S1)

serum. Unless noted, all tumors were initially grown in 20% O2
then subsequently moved to 5% O2 for a minimum of 30 days
prior to experiments as described previously (17). About 5% O2
was maintained by regulated nitrogen injection into a ThermoScientiﬁc Forma Series II incubator. Cultures were maintained
in the indicated oxygen tension uninterrupted for at least 48
hours prior to use. To generate TLs, cells were pelleted, washed
with PBS, then killed by 5 freeze thaw cycles, and complete lysis
was conﬁrmed by trypan blue exclusion.
Microarray
Total RNA was isolated from snap-frozen tissue at resection,
or cultured cells from the primary tumor at grown at 5% or 20%
O2. Expression levels of 18,401 genes were analyzed using a
Whole-Genome Gene Expression DASL assay (Illumina). For
detailed methods, see Supplementary Material.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Extracted RNA was analyzed by real-time PCR using SYBR
Green one step PCR master mix (Qiagen). The following
conditions were used for PCR in an ABI PRISM 7500 thermocycler: 95 C for 15 minutes; 94 C for 30 seconds, 55 C for 30
seconds, 68 C for 30 seconds in a total of 40 cycles; 72 C for 10
minutes; and 10 C until collected. Relative quantiﬁcation of
gene expression was calculated and normalized to glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase expression levels using the
2ðDDCt Þ method (18). Primers are listed in Supplementary
Table S2.
Flow cytometry
A total of 5  105 cells were stained with the following
antibodies: anti-CD133/2 (clone 293C3; Miltenyi), EphA2
(clone 371805), SOX2 (clone 245610), Nestin (clone
196909), HER-2/neu (clone 191924; R&D Systems), and
IL13Ra2 (clone B-D13; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Following
3 washes, CD133/2 was stained with a secondary antimouse-647; IL13Ra2 and EphA2 were stained with secondary anti-mouse-PE along with their respective isotype
control and analyzed using a FACSCanto II. For DC phenotyping, 5  105 DCs were stained with CD80-FITC (clone
L307.4), CD86-PE (clone IT2.2), CD83-PE (clone HB15E),
HLA-DR-APC (clone G46-6), and HLA-ABC-FITC (clone
W6132; BD Biosciences), incubated at 4 C for 30 minutes,
washed, ﬁxed, then analyzed on a FACSCalibur. Intracellular
staining was done according to the manufacturer's protocol
(BD Biosciences) using 2 mmol/L GolgiStop for 4 hours prior
to staining.
TL-pulsed DCs and DC uptake assay
Monocytes were puriﬁed using CD14 magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech) from the peripheral blood of healthy HLA-A2þ
donors (Supplementary Table S3), plated at a concentration of
5  105 in 24-well plates and matured as previously described
(19). On day 6, DCs were pulsed with whole TLs derived in
either 5% or 20% O2 containing 100 mg of protein and matured
prior to experiments. To assess TL uptake, tumor cells were
labeled with 10 uM carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester
(CFSE), lysed, and pulsed onto immature DCs harvested at

day 6 of culture. Twenty-four hours later later, DCs were
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte assays
A total of 1  106 HLA-A2þ peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) from normal donors were added to lysate-pulsed
DCs with 50 IU IL-2 and incubated for 7 days. For restimulation,
a second set of pulsed DCs was added to the coculture for 4
days. On day 11, PBMCs were cocultured with 2  104 CFSElabeled HLA-A2þ glioma cells cultured in 20% O2 for 6 hours,
then analyzed by ﬂow cytometry to determine cytotoxicity as
described (20). For the blocking assay, 1.25 mg anti-HLA-ABC
(clone G46-2.6) was added to target cells for 25 minutes before
washing and adding PBMCs. A competition cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay was also conducted whereby target cells
were precultured in 2 oxygen levels and pooled as follows: 1.5 
104 glioma cells cultured in 5% O2 were stained with 10 uM/mL
of CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen) and added to 1.5  104 glioma
cells cultured in 20% O2 stained with 10 uM/mL carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE). Pooled target cells were
cocultured with PBMCs in 20% O2 for 6 hours, then analyzed
by ﬂow cytometry whereby the targets were distinguished via
violet or CFSE.
CMV assay
A total of 5  105 HLA-A2þ immature DCs were pulsed with
whole TLs derived in 5% or 20% O2 TLs containing 100 mg of
protein with or without addition of 10 mg of pp65495–503
(NLVPMVATV) and matured as described above. Following
maturation, DCs were washed 3 times, and 5  105 PBMCs
from cytomegalovirus (CMV) sera-positive donors were added
to DCs. CMV sera-negative PBMCs were used as a control. Cells
were incubated for 48 hours, then supernatant was analyzed by
cytometric bead array (BD Biosciences) for IFNg. Cells were
cultured for an additional 24 hours, stained with anti-CD8,
HLA-A2 pp65(495-503) pentamer (ProImmune), and then
stained intracellularly for IFNg.
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons were made by ANOVA, followed by
posthoc comparisons using a 2-tailed t test. All tests were
conducted with Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Values of P < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.
See Supplementary Material for additional materials and
methods.

Results and Discussion
To compare tissue cultures to the primary tumor in situ,
mRNA expression levels were proﬁled in replicate from 2
glioblastomas and cultured cells derived from the same tumor
grown in 5% and 20% O2. There was a signiﬁcant difference in
the expression of 3,333 genes between the 20% O2 culture and
the in situ tumor in both patients (Supplementary Fig. S1). Of
these, 77 genes were differentially expressed between the 5%
and 20% O2 cultures (Fig. 1), trending towards expression levels
observed in situ in 5% O2 cultures. Differential expression of
CD133 (PROMININ-1) that was detected by microarray was

EphA2-reactive CD8 T cells have been documented in longterm survivors (23). Collectively, these experiments showed
that cells cultured in 5% O2 better reﬂect gene expression on
the tumor in situ, are enriched for markers of "stemness" and
higher expression of glioma-associated antigens.
We next asked if oxygen would alter the ability of TLs to
prime tumoricidal T cells. HLA-A2þ PBMCs from normal
donors were primed by autologous DCs pulsed with TLs
derived from 3 different glioma patients. Primed PBMCs were

further validated by PCR, ﬂow cytometric, and Western blot
analysis (Fig. 2A–C). It is uncertain that enrichment in CD133
expression reﬂected selective growth of CD133þ cells because
studies have shown that reducing oxygen rapidly induces
CD133 expression on CD133 cells (21). We also investigated
the expression of genes of interest that were not statistically
different by array analyses. A trend towards increased expression of stem cell markers SOX2 and Nestin was apparent in 5%
O2 but this failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 2B; P >
0.05). Importantly for immunotherapy, 5% O2 increased expression of EphA2 and IL13Ra2, both of which are overexpressed in
a high percentage of glioblastomas and seem viable as immunotherapeutic targets (Fig. 2A–C). Malignant glioma patients

assessed for their ability to lyse the same HLA-A2þ glioma cells
that were used for priming. PBMCs primed by 5% O2 TLs
showed superior tumoricidal activity against glioma target
cells cultured in standard 20% O2 in 3 of 3 patients (Fig. 3A).
Blockade of MHC I-TCR interactions by pretreatment of target
cells with an anti-MHC I antibody prevented speciﬁc lysis,
implicating CTLs as the main effectors in this assay (Fig. 3B).
A plausible explanation for the enhancement in CTL priming
would be improvement of DC maturation by 5% O2 TLs. The
expression of costimulatory and MHC molecules on DCs was
measured after pulsing with TLs from 20% or 5% O2. There
were no appreciable differences in expression of CD83, CD80,
CD86, HLA-ABC, or HLA-DR (Supplementary Fig. S2). The
levels of DC-elaborated IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12p70 were
measured 48 hours after lysate pulsing, revealing no signiﬁcant
differences between 5% and 20% O2 lysates (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Therefore, the adjuvant activity of 5% O2 TLs was not
likely due to enhancing DC maturation or cytokine expression,
suggesting other mechanisms.
We also interrogated the effect of oxygen on the target cells
by establishing a competitive cytotoxicity assay whereby CTLs
were cocultured with targets precultured in 5% and 20% O2.
Target cells cultured in 5% O2 were signiﬁcantly more resistant
to CTL killing than targets grown in 20% O2, only showing
susceptibility to CTLs primed with TLs from 5% O2 at high

effector:target ratios (Fig. 3C). We reproducibly observed suppression of the ability of CTLs primed by 20% O2 TLs to kill any
target in the presence of targets precultured in 5% O2
(compare Fig. 3A–C). We speculate that the target cells precultured in 5% O2 may have expressed factors that inhibited
CTL killing, which is supported by increased TGFb1/latentancy-associated peptide complex cell surface expression on a
subset of target cells cultured in 5% O2 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
The differences measured in target cell susceptibility to CTL
killing were not due to differential labeling efﬁciency (Supplementary Fig. S5). Despite the ability of target cells grown in 5%
O2 to directly suppress CTL killing, when these cells were lysed
and processed in DCs (wherein suppressive factors could be
degraded or overridden), they reproducibly primed CTLs with
enhanced ability to kill target cells at conventional and physiologic oxygen. Accordingly, CTLs primed by TLs from 5% O2
would be expected to have more tumoricidal function in vivo
where oxygen is limited.
Experiments were conducted to determine whether the
superior CTL priming achieved with 5% O2 TLs could be due
to changes in lysate uptake. Immature DCs were pulsed with
CFSE-labeled glioma TLs from cells grown in 5% or 20% O2.
Flow cytometry-based detection of CFSEþHLA-DRþ cells
(marking DCs loaded with lysate) revealed that 5% O2 TLs
were uptaken by a signiﬁcantly greater percentage of DCs

were used to control for CD8 T cell activation independent
of pp65495–503. Soluble IFNg in the tissue culture supernatant
was quantiﬁed as a measure of CD8 T cell activation (Fig. 4B).
There was no signiﬁcant difference in IFNg elaborated
between the nonpulsed and TL-pulsed PBMCs from serapositive donors, showing negligible reactivity to possible CMV
antigens in the TLs themselves (25). As expected, PBMCs from
sera-positive donors primed with pp65495–503 alone (no TLs)
elaborated IFNg at levels 10-fold above background, whereas
sera-negative donor PBMCs did not respond to pp65495–503.
PBMCs primed with pp65495–503 mixed with 5% O2 TLs

compared with TLs derived in 20% O2 (Fig. 4A). Thus, as of yet
unidentiﬁed factor(s) in the 5% O2 TLs increased the fraction of
DCs that engulfed TLs in tissue culture.
We then tested the hypothesis that 5% O2 TLs should exhibit
intrinsic adjuvant properties independent of glioma antigen
expression by mixing the lysates with pp65 derived from CMV.
CMV-derived pp65495–503 is an HLA-A2-restricted immunodominant epitope to which CMV sera-positive patients typically
have CD8 T cell memory responses (reviewed in 24). PBMCs
from sera-positive donors were cocultured with TL or TL/
pp65495–503 loaded DCs. PBMCs from sera-negative donors

that pp65-reactive CD8 T cells were the main source of IFNg,
ﬂow cytometry was conducted to assess IFNg expression
speciﬁcally in CD8þpp65-pentamerþ cells (Fig. 4C). Consistent
with measured soluble IFNg, CD8þpp65-pentamerþ cells
primed by 5% O2 TLs plus pp65495–503 produced more IFNg
on a per-cell basis relative to all other groups. Taken together,
these data show that 5% O2 TLs have intrinsic adjuvant activity
that is independent of the amount of glioma antigen expressed.
It is noteworthy that these ﬁndings paralleled what we recently
reported using established murine glioma cell lines; speciﬁcally
that 5% O2 TLs increased the presentation of exogenous
ovalbumin on MHC I and enhanced CD8 T cell activation,
whereas 20% O2 TLs were suppressive to CD8 T cell priming
and alternatively promoted antibody responses (17).
In summary, our data show that within tissue culture
oxygen functions as a master "immunologic switch" by simultaneously regulating the expression of glioma antigens and
factors that modulate DC-mediated priming of CD8 T cells.
Growing primary glioma cells in 1% to 7% O2 increased cancer
stem cell markers in several previous studies (13–15) and this
study, suggesting that the T cells primed might be better suited
to eradicate cancer stem cells in situ. By selecting for expression of glioma antigens that are more abundant on the tumor
in situ, we propose that oxygen can be exploited to prime CD8
T cells with greater speciﬁcity to antigens that are actually
presented MHC molecules in situ.
Most of the experiments conducted were done by reverting
cultures initially grown in 20% O2 to 5% O2, suggesting that the
immunogenicity of standard tumor cell vaccines could be
"rescued" by conversion to 5% O2. However, the enhancement
in immunogenicity afforded by low oxygen was not an artifact
of conversion from 20% O2 to 5% O2 because cells cultured
directly from surgical resections in 5% O2 exhibited, (i)
increased expression of CD133, IL-13Ra2, and Epha2 (Supple-

mentary Fig. S6) and (ii) enhanced uptake by DCs (Fig. 4A), and
intrinsic adjuvant activity as shown by increasing pp65495–503
cross-priming (Fig. 4B–C). The same trends in Fig. 4 were also
observed by reverting cultures initially grown in 20% O2 to 5%
O2 (data not shown). Thus, the changes in immunogenicity are
reversible and are present regardless of the initial oxygen
tension used to establish the cell culture. Tumor cells grown
in physiologic oxygen are inherently more capable of priming
CD8 T cells by a mechanism that seems independent of
increasing MHC I/II, CD80/83/86, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, or IL12p70
expression in DCs. A deeper investigation into the mechanisms
by which oxygen regulates tumor cell immunogenicity in the
context of T cell priming needs to be undertaken to establish a
molecular basis for our results. We propose that vaccines made
by expansion of primary tumor cells in physiologic oxygen will
serve as a powerful system to induce clinically useful antitumor
immune responses.
