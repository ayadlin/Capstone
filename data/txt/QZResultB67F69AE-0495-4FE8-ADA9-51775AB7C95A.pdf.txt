Abstract
Background & Aims: All-trans Retinoic acid (RA) regulates hepatic lipid and bile
acid homeostasis. Similar to bile acid (BA), RA accelerates partial hepatectomy (PHx)induced liver regeneration. Because there is a bidirectional regulatory relationship
between gut microbiota and BA synthesis, we examined the effect of RA in altering
the gut microbial population and BA composition and established their relationship
with hepatic biological processes during the active phases of liver regeneration.
Methods: C57BL/6 mice were treated with RA orally followed by 2/3 PHx. The
roles of RA in shifting gut microbiota and BA profiles as well as hepatocyte metabolism
and proliferation were studied.
Results: RA-primed mice exhibited accelerated hepatocyte proliferation revealed
by higher numbers of Ki67-positive cells compared to untreated mice. Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes phyla dominated the gut microbial community (>85%) in both control
and RA-primed mice after PHx. RA reduced the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes,
which was associated with a lean phenotype. Consistently, RA-primed mice lacked
transient lipid accumulation normally found in regenerating livers. In addition, RA
altered BA homeostasis and shifted BA profiles by increasing the ratio of hydrophilic
to hydrophobic BAs in regenerating livers. Accordingly, metabolic regulators fibroblast
growth factor 21, Sirtuin1, and their downstream targets AMPK and ERK1/2 were
more robustly activated in RA-primed than unprimed regenerating livers.
Conclusions: Priming mice with RA resulted in a lean microbiota composition
and hydrophilic BA profiles, which were associated with facilitated metabolism and
enhanced cell proliferation.

INTRODUCTION

is blocked from reaching the liver [6]. Furthermore, both
germ-free and LPS-resistant mice exhibit delayed liver
regeneration after liver resection, which can be rescued
by LPS administration [7]. In addition to proliferation,
the gut microbiota modulates host metabolic phenotype
and participates in microbial-host co-metabolism [8].
Alterations in gut bacterial communities are associated
with metabolic disorders [9], metabolic syndrome [10],
obesity [11-13], and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [14].
Taken together, there is a close relationship between
microbial-host metabolism and tissue injury as well as
regeneration [15, 16].
Besides LPS, another gut-derived signaling that
contributes to liver regeneration is bile acid (BA).
There is substantial metabolic demand during liver
regeneration, and proper function of intestinal nutrient
absorption-mediated by BAs is essential for normal liver

The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in promoting
cell proliferation. For examples, germ-free mice have
reduced intestinal epithelial cell turnover due to decreased
proliferation, apoptosis, and crypt-to-tip cellular migration
[1]. Gut microbiota-generated toll-like receptor signals
are required for injured tissues to regenerate and regain
homeostasis [2]. Moreover, conventional mice have
reduced cancer incidence compared with germ-free mice
[3], and an increased bacterial load is found in colonic
biopsies from patients with colorectal adenoma or cancer
[4]. One mechanism by which bacteria promote cell
proliferation is through the stimulatory effect of gram
negative bacteria-generated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
on DNA synthesis [5]. It has been shown in mice that
hepatic DNA synthesis is impaired when gut-derived LPS

repair. The hydrophobic nature of BAs facilitates lipid
absorption while conjugated hydrophilic BAs are more
effective in lipid emulsification [17]. Fine-tuned lipid
and BA homeostasis is important in supporting liver
regeneration. Steatosis dampens liver repair capability
[18, 19], and leptin-inhibited hepatic fat accumulation
also impairs partial hepatectomy (PHx)-induced liver
regeneration [20]. Additionally, BA overload induces
liver injury in regenerating liver and increases mortality
[21-23]. However, BA depletion by cholestyramine
reduces liver regeneration capability, and the restored
liver mass is reduced by 50% [24]. Together, maintaining
BA homeostasis is crucial for normal progression of liver
regeneration [15, 16].
Hepatic enzymes together with bacteria enzymes
are responsible for generating various kinds of BAs.
Microbiota plays a pivotal role in BA synthesis by
increasing BA composition diversity via de-conjugation,
dehydrogenation, dihydroxylation, and sulfation of
primary BAs in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [25].
Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) detected from Bacteroides,
Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus catalyzes the deconjugation of BAs to liberate free primary BAs.
Furthermore, several bacteria belonging to the
Firmicutes phylum have hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase,
which mediates BA oxidation and epimerization. The
compositions of BAs between germ-free and conventional
rats are markedly different [26]. A cross-sectional study of
patients with cirrhosis showed elevated primary BAs and
Enterobacteriaceae and diminished 7α-dehydroxylating
bacteria including Lachonospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae,
and Blautia, which convert free BAs to secondary BAs
[27]. Gut microbiota-generated deoxycholic acid (DCA)
and lithocholic acid (LCA) induce cell proliferation and
GI cancers [28]. These findings clearly indicate that gut
microbiota modulate host BA synthesis and diversity,
which in turn influence liver function.
Similar to BAs, all-trans retinoic acid (RA),
naturally presented in the GI tract, has a profound
effect in regulating lipid homeostasis [29, 30]. We have
previously shown that RA can facilitate PHx-induced
liver regeneration via inducing cell cycle gene expression,
which was comparable to the liver regeneration effect
of cholic acid (CA) [24, 31]. Because of the intimate
relationship between gut-derived signaling and liver
regeneration, we hypothesize that RA may regulate gut
microbiota and BA composition thereby promoting
hepatocyte proliferation in regenerating livers. To test
this hypothesis, we analyzed the gut microbiota and BA
composition to understand their potential role in PHxinduced liver regeneration in response to RA treatment.
Our data showed that priming mice with RA resulted in a
lean microbiota composition and hydrophilic BA profile,
which were associated with facilitated metabolism and
accelerated hepatocyte proliferation.

Wild type mice received an oral gavage of RA or
vehicle, and PHx was performed 48 hours later. RAprimed mouse livers had higher induction of cell cycle
gene expressions, including Cyclin D (0-1, 2 day), Cyclin
E (0-2 day), Cyclin A (0-1.5 day), and Cyclin B (0-2
day) (Figure 1A). The hepatic protein levels of CYCLIN
D (0-0.5 day) and CYCLIN A (0-1 day) also showed
increased induction (Figure 1B). RA-induced cell cycle
gene expression correlated with enhanced liver regrowth
and proliferation, as shown by greater liver-to-body
weight ratio and numbers of Ki67-positive cells at all
studied times (Figure 1C). Together, RA administration
accelerated liver regeneration. Interesting, lipid droplets,
usually occurring 1-1.5 day after PHx [18], were absent
in RA-primed mouse livers (Figure 1D), indicating a
regulatory effect on lipid metabolism by RA during liver
regeneration.

Priming mice with RA altered gut microbiota
during liver regeneration
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla dominated
the microbial community ( > 85%) in both control and
RA-primed mice during liver regeneration (Figure 2A).
In control mice, there was a transient increase in the
abundance of Verrucomicrobia which rose to 7% on day
1, continued increasing to 15% on day 1.5, and contracted
to 0.6% on day 2. However, in RA-primed mice, the
Verrucomicrobia increase was only detected on 1.5 day
after PHx (Figure 2A). RA-treated mice had a reduced
ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes 1 day after surgery
(2-fold increase in Bacteroidetes) (Figure 2B). The
Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae are two of the
most abundant families from the Firmicutes phyla found in
the mammalian intestine, and are associated with intestinal
health [32]. Higher levels of Ruminococcaceae (day
2) and Lachnospiraceae (0, 0.5, 2 days) were observed
in RA-primed mice (Figure 2C). At the genus level,
Akkermansia from the Verrucomicrobia phyla appeared on
day 1 (7%), increased to 14.6% on day 1.5, and became
undetectable on day 2 in the control mice. The appearance
of Akkermansia was delayed in RA-treated mice (Figure
2D). RA increased the abundance of genus Lactobacillus
by four folds on day zero (Figure 2D). The abundance
of Bifidobacterium was also dramatically higher in RAprimed mice on day zero and 1 day after PHx ( > 9 folds)
(Figure 2D).

RA regulates the expression of BA homeostasis
genes during liver generation

Ibabp (0-1 day) (Figure 3C). Organic solute transporter
beta (Ostβ), a basolateral BA efflux transporter, was also
induced in the ileum during liver regeneration, and its
induction was further enhanced by RA-priming (day 0.5)
(Figure 3C). RA had no effect in regulating ATP-binding
cassette, sub-family g, member 5 (Abcg5), Abcg8, Ostα,
and Abca1 expression. However, these genes were induced
in regenerating livers (Figure 3D).

Studies of the hepatic BA synthesis pathway
revealed that priming mice with RA reduced the expression
of hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) and sterol
12α-hydroxylase (Cyp8b1) on day zero. At the protein
level, RA reduced CYP7A1 (0-1 day) and CYP8B1 (0,
1, 2 day), but increased CYP8B1 on day 1.5 (Figure 3A).
In the ileum, PHx itself induced small heterodimer
partner (Shp) and fibroblast growth factor (Fgf15)
expression immediately after surgery (day 0.5) and this
induction was sustained throughout the active phase of
hepatocyte proliferation. Priming mice with RA further
increased the expression of Shp (0.5 day) and Fgf15
(0-0.5 day) indicating an effect of RA in modulating
BA-mediated FXR signaling in the ileum during liver
regeneration (Figure 3B). SHP and FGF15 protein levels
showed a consistent increase with the biggest difference on
0.5 day (Figure 3B). Similar patterns were also observed
for the expression of ileal organic anion transporting
polypeptide-2 (Oatp2), apical sodium-dependent bile
acid transporter (Asbt), and ileal bile acid-binding protein
(Ibabp). The expression of these transporters was induced
after PHx, indicating increased intestinal BA uptake
during liver regeneration [33]. Furthermore, RA enhanced
the expression of Oatp2 (0-0.5 day), Asbt (0.5, 2 day), and

RA alters hepatic BA profile during liver
regeneration
Hepatic BAs quantification showed that priming
mice with RA had no effect on the amount of total bile
acids (TBA) (Figure 4A). However, RA treatment
shifted the composition of free BAs (Figure 4B).
Tauro-conjugation of BAs increases their hydrophilic/
hydrophobic ratio, solubility and lipid emulsification
[17], and the taurocholic acid (TCA)/CA ratio was
significantly higher in RA-treated mice compared to
controls (Figure 4C). The tauro-β-muricholic acid (T-βMCA) to β-muricholic acid (β-MCA) ratio, associated
with increasing lipid emulsion efficiency [8, 17], was also
higher in RA-primed mice compared to controls on day
zero and 1 day after PHx (Figure 4D).

RA regulates energy homeostasis by inducing
FGF21 signaling

(Figure 5A). AMPK has been shown to induce NAD+dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activity (day 1
and 2), resulting in modulation of downstream targets
including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ
coactivator 1α (Pgc1α), carnitine acyltransferase 1 (Cpt1),
and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor
1c (Srebp1c) [35]. Increased FGF21 was accompanied
by elevated SIRT1, Pgc1α, and Cpt1 0-1 day after PHx
(Figure 5B). In addition, PHx did not affect the total
extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)
level, but rather induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which
was further increased by RA on day 0 and 0.5 day (Figure
5B).

Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a master
metabolic regulator that has a striking ability to reverse
obesity, diabetes, and injury as well as prolong life span
[34]. FGF21 is transiently induced during the early
phase of liver regeneration [23]. RA treatment resulted
in early induction of FGF21 mRNA and protein levels
after PHx (Figure 5A). Serine/threonine kinase 11
(LKB1), a downstream target of FGF21, also showed
earlier induction in RA-primed mice after PHx. FGF21
increases the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) through LKB1 [35]. Higher phosphoAMPK level was found in RA-treated mice on day 0, 0.5,
and 1.5, but RA did not alter total AMPK protein level

DISCUSSION

induction of SHP and Fgf15 has been shown to mediate this
suppression [30]. During liver regeneration, RA can boost
this Fxr-mediated pathway to further inhibit hepatic BA
synthesis. Asbt absorbs the majority of BAs available in
the adjacent lumen of the ileum and is critical for intestinal
BA reabsorption during enterohepatic recirculation [45].
Mutation or inhibition of Asbt causes BA malabsorption
and interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of BAs
resulting in chronic diarrhea, steatorrhea, and fat-soluble
vitamin malabsorption [45, 46]. In the intestines, BAs are
transported by Ibabp, after which they are secreted back
into circulation by several transporters including Ostα/β.
The up regulation of these genes found in regenerating
livers can accelerate BA circulation, thereby protecting
hepatocytes against high concentration of BAs. Together,
the presented data illustrated that in response to liver
resection, the enterohepatic recirculation adapted to the
immediate BA overload by inhibiting hepatic BA synthesis
and inducing intestinal BAs transporters, both of which
were enhanced by RA.
It is possible that through gut microbiota-modulated
BA composition, RA facilitated metabolism, which
contributed to accelerated liver regeneration. Metabolism
of BAs by gut microbes increases BA diversity, thus not
only affecting BA and lipid homeostasis, but also other
aspects of host health [8]. For example, BSH activity,
produced in significant amounts by Lactobacillus and
Bifidobacterium, could be a way for bacterial species
to detoxify BAs [8]. In addition, the dehydroxylation
of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) forms LCA, which
is toxic to hepatocytes and has been linked to colon
carcinogenesis [28]. Conversely, epimerization of
CDCA generates ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), which
is chemoprotective and is used to treat cholesterol
gallstone [47]. Furthermore, conjugated BAs reduce the
hydrophobic/hydrophilic ratio and are more effective in
lipid emulsification and micelle formation. The presented
data revealed a shift towards hydrophilic and conjugated
BAs in RA-treated mice. Together, RA treatment may
exert beneficial BA metabolism by intestinal microbes for
liver regeneration.
FGF21 is required for activation of hepatic lipid
oxidation, triglyceride clearance, and ketogenesis during
fasting [48]. Administration of FGF21 to rodents with
diet-induced or genetic obesity and diabetes resulted in
potent antihyperglycemic and triglyceride lowering effects
[35]. Forced FGF21 expression in partial hepatectomized
hPPARαPAC mice reduced hepatic steatosis, prevented
focal necrosis, and restored liver mass [23]. LKB1
and AMPK are required for FGF21-mediated energy
regulation of mitochondrial oxidative function [35] via
Pgc1α, Cpt1, and Srebp1c [49, 50]. Inhibition of AMPK
activity attenuated FGF21-stimulated increase in Cpt1 and
Pgc1α gene expression [35]. Both AMPK and SIRT1 act
together with Pgc1α, the master regulator of mitochondrial
biogenesis, to modulate energy homeostasis in response to

Emerging evidence indicates that bidirectional
communication exists between the gut microbiota and BAs
through a “gut-liver axis” [1, 25]. The gut microbiome has
increasingly been acknowledged as a novel contributor to
host metabolism [25, 27]. Mounting evidence in mice and
humans supports that the gut microbiota is linked with
metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity [1, 27].
Liver resection changes lipid and BA metabolism during
a period when increased energy production is needed to
meet the metabolic demands of cell proliferation [36].
We demonstrated, for the first time, that RA altered the
gut microbiota composition and BA profile, which was
accompanied by an increase in energy metabolism,
beneficial for liver regeneration.
Alterations in gut microbiota composition have been
implicated in metabolic disorders, and specific bacterial
phylotypes or metabolic activities may be beneficial or
detrimental to patients with obesity [1, 8]. Firmicutes and
Bacteroidetes are the two most dominant bacterial phyla
that affect the efficiency of host energy extraction and are
linked with excess adiposity in both mice and humans
[13, 37]. Obese mice have more Firmicutes and fewer
Bacteroidetes compared to lean mice. The role of RA in
regulating lipid homoestasis had been defined by genomic
binding and transcriptome profiling [29]. Decreased lipid
accumulation and the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes
presented in RA-primed mice are associated with
accelerated liver regeneration, indicating beneficial lipid
metabolism induced by RA during liver regeneration.
Phyla Verrucomicrobia is occasionally observed,
and is capable of pathogenic activity with growth
inhibition toward the host [38, 39]. Lachnospiraceae
and Ruminococcaceae are the most abundant Firmicute
families in the intestines, accounting for roughly 50% and
30% of phylotypes, respectively in healthy adults [40, 41].
Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, associated with
the production of butyrate necessary for colonic epithelial
health, have been shown to be depleted in inflammatory
bowel disease patients [42, 43]. The gut microbiota exerts
a strong influence on energy homeostasis due to bacteriaproduced butyrate which serves as an energy source for
colonocytes [44]. The increased Lachnospiraceae and
Ruminococcaceae due to RA treatment may increase
butyrate production, which may benefit liver regeneration.
BAs are efficiently conserved under normal
conditions by a process termed enterohepatic recirculation
[33]. Conjugated and unconjugated BAs are reabsorbed
by passive diffusion along the entire gut and by active
transport in the terminal ileum. BA overload has been
observed after liver resection, and Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1
inhibition indicate the necessity to down-regulate BA
synthesis during liver regeneration [23, 24]. Cyp7a1
expression can be regulated by a negative feedback loop
involving intestinal BA signaling [22, 33]. RA-mediated

environmental and nutritional stimuli [35]. The sustained
activation of ERK1/2, can also be regulated by FGF21 to
induce stimulatory cell cycle regulators [51]. Transient
accumulation of hepatocellular fat during the early stage
of liver regeneration has been proposed to serve as an
β-oxidation energy source for hepatocellular proliferation
[52]. Consistently, infusion of octanoylcarnitine, an
inhibitor of β-oxidation, decreased DNA synthesis and
energy charge levels in regenerating livers [53]. Mice
treated with RA seem to have increased efficiency in
lipid transport and metabolism, which is suggested by
a lack of lipid accumulation and accelerated hepatocyte
proliferation.
In summary, our data showed that RA-accelerated
liver regeneration was accompanied by a decreased ratio
of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, which is known to be
associated with a lean phenotype. Consistently, RA-primed
mice lacked the transient lipid accumulation normally
found in regenerating mouse livers. In addition, RA altered
BA signaling, enhanced enterohepatic recirculation of
BAs, and increased the hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio of
BAs in the regenerating livers, potentially yielding higher
solubility and lipid emulsification capability in RA-primed
mice. RA-priming afforded more efficient lipid circulation
and induction of the FGF21-LKB1-AMPK pathway,
which boosted the energy metabolism necessary for liver
regeneration. A better mechanistic understanding of the
proliferative effects exerted by RA through modulating gut
microbiota composition may allow for the development of
therapeutics to promote liver regeneration in the clinical
setting.

Cecal DNA was extracted using the MoBio power
soil kit (MoBio) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Multiplexed DNA libraries were prepared according to a
previously described protocol [56]. In brief, the V4 domain
was amplified using primers 515F and 806R, a set of
prokaryotic universal primers that was well-validated and
used as the standard protocol for the Earth Microbiome
Project (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/), with a unique
identifier sequence for each sample. Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) mixtures contained 1 Unit Kapa2G Robust
Hot Start Polymerase (Kapa Biosystems), 1.5 mM MgCl2,
10 pmol of each primer, and 2 ng of DNA. PCR included
95°C for 2 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 15
seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 45 seconds
and a final extension of 72°C for 3 minutes. The amplicon
libraries were sequenced using 2 × 250-bp paired-end
protocol on an Illumina Miseq system. Sequencing reads
were trimmed of their barcodes, demultiplexed and
combined using custom Perl scripts and aligned to the
Greengenes (release 13_5) database using Qiime with
default parameters.

Quantification of bile acids
BAs were analyzed using a ProminenceTM UFLC
system (Shimadzu, Kyoto) coupled to an API 4000
QTRAPTM mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, CA) operated in
negative ionization mode based on published methods [23,
57, 58]. Chromatography was performed on a Kinetex C18
column (50 mm X 2.1 mm, 2.6 μm) maintained at 40°C
preceded by high pressure column prefilter. The mobile
phase consisted of methanol gradient delivered at a flow
rate of 0.4 ml/min.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal
Male C57BL/6 mice (3-5 months old) were housed
in steel microisolator cages at 22°C with a 12-hour light/
dark cycle. Food and water were provided ad libitum
throughout study. RA (25 μg/gram of body weight, one
time) (Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) or vehicle
control (carboxymethyl cellulose) (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.,
St. Louis, MO) was administered to the mice by gavage.
Forty-eight hours after treatment, 2/3 PHx was performed
[31, 54, 55]. Mice were killed 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 days after
surgery (n = 4) covering the time when hepatocytes are
actively proliferating. Zero time point mice, which were
killed immediately after PHx, served as controls (0 day).
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals under protocols approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the University of California, Davis.
