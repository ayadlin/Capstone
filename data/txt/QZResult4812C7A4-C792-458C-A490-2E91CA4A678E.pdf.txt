Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Many
Treatments, Many Options, Many Challenges
Ahead
Jorge A. Garcia, MD, FACP and Brian I. Rini, MD, FACP

Although the long natural history of prostate cancer presents challenges in the development of novel therapeutics,
major contributions have been observed recently. A better understanding of the long-term complications of androgen deprivation has changed the initial approach to most patients with advanced disease. Specifically, recognition of
the limitations of prostate-specific antigen has driven the pursuit of new tools capable of becoming true surrogates
for disease outcome. Understanding the molecular biology of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has led to
a dramatic paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with metastatic disease where the androgen receptor becomes
a central therapeutic target. Specific adrenal inhibitors and engineered super androgen receptor inhibitors have
become the most promising agents in the disease. Novel immune therapies have been shown to improve survival in
selected patients with castration-resistant disease despite the inability to impact traditional markers of response.
Similarly, agents such as cabazitaxel and abiraterone acetate have demonstrated clinical benefit are now a standard
of care in docetaxel-refractory metastatic CRPC patients. All these changes have occurred in a relatively short period
and are likely to change the prostate cancer treatment paradigm. This review summarizes the current management

Although its timing remains controversial, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the standard initial therapy
for advanced prostate cancer. Testosterone suppression can be achieved either through surgical or medical castration. For
patients undergoing medical castration, ADT can be prescribed alone or in combination with an androgen receptor (AR)
antagonist.1 Although the majority of patients with advanced prostate cancer have an initial response to ADT, nearly all
patients will eventually progress to a ‘‘castration-resistant’’ state. The definition for castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) has been standardized and requires castrate levels of testosterone with either rising levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), radiographic progression, and/or worsening of symptoms.2,3 Treatment options for patients with metastatic
CRPC have evolved in recent years and include secondary hormonal manipulations, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy.3 In the castrate-resistant state, testosterone does not appear to be the major ligand capable of activating the AR. However, prostate cancer progression continues to be largely dependent on AR and AR-responsive pathways.3,4 In this review,
the current standard of care for CRPC patients, including recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
agents, as well as the new generation of compounds undergoing clinical development, are discussed.

Importance of the AR in Castration-Resistant Disease
The AR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor and modulates
the growth and development of prostate epithelial cells.5 The role of AR in CRPC has been extensively studied. Despite
initial data suggesting the loss of AR activity in this setting, AR overexpression in tissue specimens from castrate-resistant
tumors indicates the importance of this gene even in the context of a testosterone-deprived state.6 Although the true

biological mechanism responsible for the development of
CRPC is not well understood, some of the proposed
mechanisms include AR activation in a ligand-independent manner,6,7 changes in the level of intratumoral
ligands, AR gene amplification, changes in AR coregulatory molecules, and activating AR mutations.4,8-10
Additional Hormonal Manipulations in
Castration-Resistant Disease
Historically, second-line hormonal manipulations may be
broadly grouped into 1 of 4 categories: 1) antiandrogen
withdrawal; 2) deferred use of an antiandrogen after castration or use of a second-line antiandrogen; 3) adrenal
steroidogenesis inhibition with agents such as ketoconazole or aminogluthimide; or 4) the use of alternative hormones such as estrogens.
Antiandrogen Withdrawal
Over the last decade, it has been recognized that biochemical (PSA) responses as well as symptomatic and objective
responses can be achieved in CRPC patients upon withdrawal of antiandrogen therapy. This phenomenon was initially described with flutamide,11 as well as 2 other
nonsteroidal antiandrogens, bicalutamide12,13 and nilutamide.14,15 Responses have also been documented after removal of the steroidal antiandrogen, megestrol acetate,16
and estrogens such as diethylstilbestrol (DES).17 Antiandrogen withdrawal responses occur in 15%-30% of patients.
The average response duration is 3-6 months, although in
a minority of patients, responses can be durable for 2 years
or more.11-15 Antiandrogen withdrawal should be the first
intervention for patients with progressive CRPC while on
combined androgen blockade. This intervention is nontoxic, is required in CRPC clinical trials, and may provide
significant benefit to a small subset of patients.
Secondary Hormonal Manipulations
Despite exhibiting androgen deprivation, many patients
with progressive disease on ADT demonstrate AR promiscuity, whereby AR is activated by nontestosterone
ligands—thus the potential clinical use of other hormonal
maneuvers in this setting.
Antiandrogens

Second-line antiandrogen therapy is predicated on
the possibility that, despite their functional similarities,
different antiandrogens have a different mechanism of
interaction with the AR.18 For example, 20% of patients
with progressive disease treated with high-dose bicaluta-

2584

mide (150 mg/d) after initial androgen deprivation will
have a >50% decline in PSA, with most responses seen in
patients who have received prior flutamide therapy.19 Similar activity has been observed with the antiandrogen nilutamide when administered at 150 mg orally once
daily.20,21 It is unclear as to what is the most appropriate
dose of second-line bicalutamide therapy (50 mg vs 150
mg). However, 50 mg orally once daily is perhaps the
most common dosage used in the United States.
It is not clear why patients have higher response
rates, although it has been hypothesized that a mutant AR
induced by prior flutamide therapy may mediate a higher
response rate to salvage bicalutamide even when administered in the second or third-line setting.
Adrenal inhibitors

Although 5%-10% of circulating testosterone in
humans is synthesized in the adrenal glands, early adrenal
androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and 5-androstenediol can exceed
the concentrations of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone and therefore lead to direct activation of wild-type
and mutant AR.22,23 Indirectly, dehydroepiandrosterone
and androstenedione can also be metabolized and converted to dihydrotestosterone.24,25 These facts have led to
the testing of agents that inhibit adrenal steroidogenesis as
therapy for CRPC (Figure 1).
The clinical efficacy and safety of the antifungal
agent ketoconazole has been studied extensively.26-29
Treatment with ketoconazole leads to a PSA decline of
>50% in a large number of patients (46%-62%). These
responses are irrespective of the antiandrogen withdrawal
phenomenon. Ketoconazole inhibits the conversion of
cholesterol to pregnenolone and other cytochrome P-450
enzymes such as CYP17 and 11b-hydroxylase, an enzyme
responsible for cortisol synthesis. In 2004, the phase 3
study CALGB 9583 investigated the use of antiandrogen
withdrawal (AAWD) in patients with CRPC with or
without the addition of ketoconazole (400 mg orally three
times daily) and hydrocortisone.30 Results of this trial
found a PSA response of 50% in 27% of patients treated
with AAWD and simultaneous ketoconazole compared
with 11% of those treated with AAWD alone (P ¼ .002).
The corresponding objective response rate was 20% and
2%, respectively (P ¼ .02), and no difference in overall
survival (OS) was seen (15.3 months vs 16.7 months,
respectively; P ¼ .936).30 In this trial, the use of sequential
therapy with ketoconazole also led to PSA and ORR of 32
and 7% respectively. Adrenal insufficiency is one of the

major limiting adverse effects of ketoconazole treatment,
hence the need for steroid replacement in all patients. In
the CALGB 9583 trial, 21% of patients receiving ketoconazole had grade 3 or 4 toxicity, with neurotoxicity and
malaise/fatigue being most common.30 Despite this finding, ketoconazole is a good therapeutic option for patients
with CRPC with PSA progression-only disease or for
patients with no or minimal symptoms and low-volume
disease, because it provides selected patients the opportunity to maintain quality of life while still receiving an
active treatment for their disease.
Estrogenic therapies

Synthetic estrogens such as DES and synthetic progestins such as megestrol acetate have also been investigated as therapies for CRPC.31,32 In a phase 2 study,
Smith et al33 demonstrated PSA declines of >50% in
43% of patients (n ¼ 21) treated with 1 mg of DES daily.
Other studies have shown similar PSA responses (>50%)
that have ranged from 29% to 55% using dosages of up to
3 mg daily.34,35 The use of these agents, and DES in particular, has been limited by the incidence of cardiac toxicity and thromboembolic complications.34,35
Immunotherapy and Prostate Cancer
Although immunotherapy has gained momentum in
prostate cancer therapeutics, the vast majority of agents

tested in this disease have yielded disappointing results,
and in the case of anti-CTLA-4 and GVAX therapy, new
concerns of safety have been raised.36-40
Sipuleucel-T is an immunotherapeutic compound
designed to stimulate an immune response against CRPC.
In a small, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n ¼
127), sipuleucel-T was found to confer a significant survival benefit for men with CRPC over placebo (median
OS, 25.9 months vs 21.4 months; P ¼ .01).41 It is important to note, however, that OS was not the primary endpoint of this trial, and that the median PFS of sipuleucelT did not differ from that of the placebo group. An integrated analysis of 2 phase 3 trials also indicated a significant benefit of sipuleucel-T over placebo in median
survival (23.2 months vs 18.9 months; P ¼ .011), but not
in median time to progression (11.1 months vs 9.7
months; P ¼ .111).42 The results of the IMPACT
(Immunotherapy for Prostate Adenocarcinoma Treatment) trial—a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase 3 trial—were reported in 2010.36 This study
enrolled 512 men with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic metastatic CRPC and randomly assigned them 2:1
to either sipuleucel-T or placebo every 2 weeks for a total
of 3 infusions. The median OS was 25.8 months for
patients treated with sipuleucel-T compared with 21.7
months for patients receiving placebo (Figure 2), with an

adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death of 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.98), representing a relative
reduction in the risk of death of 22% (P ¼ .03). The
reduction in the risk of death from prostate cancer in the
sipuleucel-T group (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.61-0.98; P ¼
.04) was similar to the reduction in the risk of death from
any cause.43 When evaluating the impact of subsequent
therapy with outcome, the estimated effect of sipuleucelT treatment for those patients receiving subsequent docetaxel-based chemotherapy was consistent with the result
of the primary efficacy analysis (HR for death, 0.78; 95%
CI, 0.62-0.98; P ¼ .03). Additional results from the trial
showed no significant difference in median time to objective disease progression (14.6 weeks vs 14.4 weeks; HR ¼
0.95; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.17; P ¼ .63), or time to clinical
disease progression (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.75-1.12; P ¼
.40). Overall, therapy with sipuleucel-T was well tolerated.43 Almost all patients in the IMPACT trial received
all 3 planned infusions, and no patient discontinued the
study secondary to toxicity. The most common toxicities
were grade 1 and 2 and included chills, fever (pyrexia),
headache, influenza-like illness, myalgia, hypertension,
hyperhidrosis, and groin pain. Most of these adverse
events (AEs) occurred within 1 day after infusion and
resolved within 1-2 days. These AEs are consistent with
cytokine release as expected from immune therapy.
Although the immune effects of this product have
been characterized in some detail, the appropriate CRPC
patient who is likely to obtain the greatest benefit from
treatment with sipuleucel-T requires further investigation.
Current appropriate candidates for this agent include only
those with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (non–

2586

opioid-requiring cancer pain) disease. Clinically, one difficulty with sipuleucel-T is the lack of effect on PSA,
symptoms, or radiographic parameters. That is, benefit to
an individual patient is difficult to gauge, and the most
beneficial timing of when to initiate sipuleucel-T and any
subsequent therapy is still unknown.
Another vaccine approach undergoing further evaluation is PROSTVAC, a construct of fowlpox and vaccinia
vectors containing costimulatory molecules (intercellular
adhesion molecule 1, B7-1, and leukocyte function–associated antigen 3).44 Initial studies have not only defined
the safety profile of this compound, but also have suggested a possible OS improvement in the CRPC setting.45-47 A pivotal phase 3 trial of PROSTVAC-VF is
currently planned.
Despite the clinical and logistical challenges
involved with these approaches, immunotherapy will
likely continue playing a major role in prostate cancer
therapeutics especially as newer agents are developed and
the appropriate individual who can truly benefit from
these interventions is defined.
Chemotherapy for Metastatic CRPC:
Historical Development of Front-Line
Chemotherapy
Mitoxantrone-based chemotherapy

In the early 1990s, 2 studies that demonstrated a
benefit in pain control and quality of life led to the FDA
approval of mitoxantrone for use in patients with
CRPC.48,49 Both trials randomized patients to either a
corticosteroid alone or mitoxantrone plus prednisone
(M/P). A PSA decline of >50% was observed in 19% and
33% of CRPC patients who received therapy with mitoxantrone plus a corticosteroid, compared with 14% and
22%, respectively, for patients who received a corticosteroid only.48,49 The trial by Tannock et al48 also showed
that palliation of symptoms was greater in the chemotherapy arm (P ¼ .01) and response duration was also longer
with mitoxantrone (43 vs. 18 weeks, P<.0001). Although
no survival advantage was observed, these trials provided
the proof of principle that clinical benefit can be derived
from chemotherapy, and today mitoxantrone remains a
viable palliative and well-tolerated intervention, although
patient selection for this therapy and timing relative to
newer agents is yet to be established.
Docetaxel-based chemotherapy

regimens demonstrated a significant OS improvement in
castration-resistant disease.50,51 In the TAX 327 study, 2
schedules of docetaxel/prednisone (D/P) (75 mg/m2
thrice weekly or 30 mg/m2 once weekly) were compared
with the standard M/P regimen (12 mg/m2 every 3
weeks).50 A survival benefit was demonstrated for the
combined D/P group and the every 3 weeks D/P group
(but not the once weekly D/P group) relative to M/P. The
median survival was 18.9 months in the every 3 weeks D/
P group; 17.4 months with weekly docetaxel; and 16.5
months with M/P (Figure 3A).50 This OS improvement
translated into a 24% relative reduction in the hazard for
death (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.94; P ¼ .009). Measurable tumor response rates were low and comparable in all
arms. Significantly more patients in the every 3 weeks D/

P arm experienced a reduction in pain compared with M/
P (35% vs 22%, respectively; P ¼ .01). Nearly a quarter
of patients in each D/P arm (22% with every 3 weeks,
23% with weekly) had a significant improvement in quality of life compared with M/P (13%). The PSA response
rate was better in each D/P arm (45% with every 3 weeks
administration, 48% with weekly administration versus
32% with M/P). Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 32%
of patients treated with every 3 weeks D/P, 22% of
patients treated with M/P, and only 2% of patients treated
with weekly D/P.
In the SWOG 9916 phase 3 trial, 770 patients were
randomized to docetaxel plus estramustine (EMP) or M/
P.51 The median survival was significantly improved (Figure 3B), with the docetaxel/EMP combination (17.5 vs
15.6 months; P ¼ .02), the relative risk of death was
reduced by 20%; and the PSA response rate was significantly better (50% vs 27%; P<.001). Greater toxicity was
observed in the docetaxel/EMP arm, with grade 3/4 gastrointestinal (20% vs 5%), hematological (neutropenic
fever, 5% vs 2%), cardiovascular (15% vs 7%), metabolic
disturbance (6% vs 1%), and neurological (7% vs 2%)
events more frequent in the docetaxel/EMP arm.
Although the magnitude of improvement in survival demonstrated in the TAX327 and SWOG-9916 studies is
modest, it represented a significant advance in the management of CRPC and led to docetaxel’s approval as the
front-line agent of choice in patients with metastatic
CRPC. Nonetheless, questions about the appropriate timing for initiation of therapy and optimal number of cycles
of therapy remain unanswered. EMP has largely been
dropped from this approach given the added toxicity and
uncertainty about additional clinical benefit.
Novel docetaxel combinations

Based on initial results observed with docetaxelbased chemotherapy, and along with available preclinical
data suggesting the potential synergistic and/or additive
activity of other cytotoxic agents, a major focus of prostate
cancer research has shifted to the evaluation of novel combinations using docetaxel as the backbone of therapy. The
combination of docetaxel with other cytotoxic agents such
as gemcitabine have not proven to confer a useful benefit
compared with historical experience with docetaxel alone
in CRPC.52 Other studies have demonstrated the activity
and tolerability of other docetaxel combinations, which
remain to be more rigorously evaluated in phase 3 trials;
53-56
however, the early phase 1 and 2 studies of novel targeted agents used in combination with docetaxel have

2587

Review Article

generally been disappointing.57-70 For example, although
a randomized phase 2 study evaluating DN-101, a high
concentration oral formulation of calcitriol71 plus docetaxel against docetaxel plus placebo (ASCENT)72 originally suggested DN-101 treatment was associated with
improved survival in men with CRPC; ASCENT 2, a
randomized, open-label, phase 3 study of weekly docetaxel plus DN-101 versus standard every 3 weeks docetaxel therapy was halted after an interim analysis
demonstrated an increased number of deaths in the DN101 arm.73 Six months after study termination, the median OS was 16.8 months (95% CI, 15.8-19.3) for
patients treated with DN-101 and 19.9 months (95% CI,
18.6-22.7) for controls. In multivariate analyses adjusting
for baseline variables, treatment with DN-101 was associated with shorter survival (HR, 1.33; P ¼ .019). Although
the OS difference observed in this study could be related
to the weekly docetaxel schema used, DN-101 as currently
formulated did not augment the clinical activity of docetaxel in CRPC.73
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
phase 3 trial comparing docetaxel, prednisone, and placebo with docetaxel, prednisone, and the anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevacizumab in
men with metastatic CRPC (CALGB 90401) also failed
to demonstrate a survival benefit for the addition of bevacizumab to standard docetaxel.74 The median OS for the
combination was 22.6 months versus 21.5 months for the
placebo arm (P ¼ .18). The progression-free survival
(PFS) and response observed in the trial, however, did
favor the addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel (median
PFS, 9.9 vs 7.5 months, respectively [P<.0001]; overall
response rate [ORR], 53% vs 42% [P ¼ .0113]; PSA
decline 50%, 69.5% vs 57.9% [P ¼ .0002]). The use of
bevacizumab or other VEGF-targeting agents in CRPC
awaits further investigation.
Second-line chemotherapy

Until recently, the treatment of men with metastatic
CRPC progressing after docetaxel-based chemotherapy
was a therapeutic challenge, because no treatment had
demonstrated survival benefit. Mitoxantrone/prednisone
(M/P) had become the de facto second line of choice primarily for its palliative effects and improvement in quality
of life, which was initially observed in front-line studies.48,49,75 Other cytotoxics explored in the second-line
setting have included the epothilones and platinum compounds. Results of a phase 2 study evaluating the combination of M/P plus ixabepilone in docetaxel-refractory

2588

patients recently demonstrated a PSA decline 50% in
45% of patients.76 Among those with measurable disease,
the ORR was 22%. The median time to PSA or objective
progression was 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.5-5.6), and the
median PFS was also 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.0-6.0). The
observed median OS was 12.5 months (95% CI, 10.215.9). Although this combination led to grade 3 and 4
neutropenia, with 11% of patients developing neutropenic fever, a phase 3 study evaluating this combination is
planned.
Satraplatin, a third generation oral platinum has also
undergone evaluation in CRPC.77 The SPARC (Satraplatin and Prednisone against Refractory Cancer) trial was a
randomized (2:1 satraplatin/placebo), placebo-controlled
phase 3 trial designed to investigate the efficacy of satraplatin with prednisone in men (N ¼ 950) with metastatic
CRPC who had progressed after at least 1 chemotherapy
regimen.78 Although the primary endpoint of the study,
PFS, was significantly longer with satraplatin (11.1 vs 9.7
weeks; P<.001), there was no difference in OS (61.3 vs
61.4 weeks; HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.84-1.15; P ¼ .80);
consequently, satraplatin was not approved by the FDA.
Recently, cabazitaxel became the first FDAapproved agent for the management of patients with metastatic CRPC who have failed docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Cabazitaxel is a semisynthetic, tubulin-binding
taxane drug as potent as docetaxel in cell lines with demonstrated antitumor activity in models resistant to paclitaxel and docetaxel.79-81 Phase 1/2 clinical studies have
also demonstrated the maximum tolerable dosage and
safety of this compound and have shown that neutropenia
and diarrhea were the primary dose-limiting toxicities.82,83 These studies also suggested antitumor activity
in solid tumors including docetaxel-refractory metastatic
CRPC.
The clinical activity of cabazitaxel in the second-line
setting was evaluated in the phase 3 TROPIC trial.84 In
this randomized trial, 755 men with metastatic CRPC
who had disease progression during or after treatment
with docetaxel were randomly assigned to prednisone (10
mg/d) with either cabazitaxel (25 mg/m2) (C/P) or mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2) (M/P), with the primary endpoint of
OS. At a median follow up of 12.8 months, the median
OS was 15.1 months (95% CI, 14.1-16.3) in the C/P
group and 12.7 months (95% CI, 11.6-13.7) in the M/P
group (Figure 4). The HR for death of men treated with
C/P compared with those taking M/P was 0.70 (95% CI,
0.59-0.83; P<.0001). The median PFS was 2.8 months
(95% CI, 2.4-3.0) in the C/P group and 1.4 months (1.4-

1.7) in the M/P group (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.86;
P<.0001). The ORR for patients with measurable disease
was 14.4% versus 4.4% (P ¼ .0005). Equally, the PSA
response rate (PSA decline 50%) was 39.2% versus
17.8% (P ¼ .0002). Of concern was the high incidence of
grade 3 and 4 neutropenia observed in 82% of patients
receiving cabazitaxel. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 8% of
these patients, and diarrhea was reported in 6%. Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was uncommon (1% of patients in
each group). Whereas 18 patients in the C/P arm died from
treatment-related AEs, including neutropenic fever/sepsis (n
¼ 7), cardiac events (n ¼ 5), dehydration/electrolyte imbalance (n ¼ 1), renal failure (n ¼ 3), cerebral hemorrhage (n
¼ 1), and 1 patient died from unknown causes, only 1
patient in the M/P arm died from febrile neutropenia.
Although cabazitaxel is the first agent capable of
demonstrating OS benefit in this setting, the toxicity profile of this agent is noteworthy. Based on the hematological AEs observed in this study, the prophylactic use of
growth factors is recommended in patients with high risk
of developing neutropenia.85 Currently, a lower dose of
cabazitaxel (20 mg/m2) is undergoing testing in a phase 3
post-marketing study (NCT01308580). Similarly, a
phase 3 front-line study evaluating C/P against docetaxel
plus prednisone has been initiated (NCT01308567).
Novel Oral Agents in CRPC
Rationally developed therapeutic strategies in CRPC have
gained momentum with the recognition that the AR
remains a major player in disease progression. Abiraterone
acetate is a novel, selective, irreversible, oral inhibitor of
CYP17 (Figure 1) capable of significantly reducing andro-

genic steroid production downstream from CYP17.86 Initial phase 1/2 studies of abiraterone acetate in
chemotherapy-naı̈ve CRPC demonstrated the safety and activity of this agent in castration-resistant disease. No grade 3
or 4 toxicities were reported. All other toxicities were attributable to a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid excess
and included lower extremity edema, hypokalemia, and
hypertension.87 A significant number of patients enrolled in
these studies achieved a decline in PSA 50% when compared with baseline PSA values. Similarly, the ORR
observed in other trials has ranged from 25%-60%.87-89
Recently, the results of COU-AA301, a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone
in chemotherapy-refractory metastatic CRPC were
reported.90 Patients (N ¼ 1195) with docetaxel-refractory,
metastatic CRPC were randomized in a 2:1 fashion to
receive abiraterone acetate 1000 mg/d plus prednisone 5
mg twice a day (n ¼ 797) or placebo/prednisone (n ¼

months for the patients in the prednisone/placebo arm
(Figure 5; HR, 0.646; P<.0001). The PSA response rate
was 38% versus 10% favoring abiraterone acetate
(P<.0001). Equally, treatment with abiraterone acetate significantly delayed radiographic PFS (5.6 vs 3.6 months,
HR, 0.67; P<.0001). As observed in previous studies, AEs
were mainly related to the mineralocorticoid excess syndrome associated with this agent. In this study, 15% of
patients in the abiraterone acetate arm developed grade 3
and 4 AEs, including liver dysfunction, hypokalemia, fluid
retention, hypertension, and cardiac disorders.
Recently, abiraterone acetate gained regulatory approval in the United States and is currently considered a
standard second-line therapy in men with progressive

disease after docetaxel-based chemotherapy. The use of this
agent in early settings remains to be defined. COU-AA302, a study evaluating abiraterone acetate in asymptomatic
or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-naı̈ve metastatic
CRPC patients has recently completed accrual, and analysis
is underway. Trials evaluating the activity of this adrenal inhibitor in patients without metastatic disease are planned.
Orteronel, also known as TAK-700, is another novel
selective inhibitor of 17, 20 lyase that has shown acceptable toxicity and reduced in vivo levels of adrenal androgens with promising clinical activity, as demonstrated in a
recently reported phase 1/2 trial in patients with CRPC.91
Similar to other adrenal inhibitors of this type, the most
common treatment-related AEs observed included grade
1 fatigue, nausea, constipation, anorexia, and vomiting.
Among patients receiving TAK-700 at 300 mg per day for
3 or more consecutive cycles, 80% had a 50% decrease
in PSA; 27% had a 90% decrease. A phase 3 placebo-

controlled trial of TAK-700 in combination with prednisone in metastatic docetaxel-refractory CRPC patients is
currently underway.
MDV3100 is a small-molecule AR antagonist with a
novel mechanism of action that blocks nuclear translocation
of AR and DNA binding, and does not have agonist activity when AR is overexpressed. It was identified from a cellbased screen that mimics castration-resistant tumors with
overexpressed AR and is active in bicalutamide-resistant
prostate cancer models.92 Results of a phase 1/2 trial demonstrated a PSA response of 57% and 45% of chemotherapy-naı̈ve and chemotherapy-refractory metastatic CRPC,
respectively. These findings provided a basis for the
AFFIRM trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3
trial of oral MDV3100 in the docetaxel-refractory CRPC
setting. This trial has recently completed accrual, and results
are expected shortly. This compound is also undergoing
evaluation in the CRPC rising PSA-only disease setting.

Another young yet promising agent is TOK-001.
TOK-001 is capable of disrupting several processes responsible for progression in CRPC. It acts as an AR antagonist, a CYP17 lyase inhibitor, and directly leads to
decreased AR levels in prostate tumors.93 The ARMOR1
(Androgen Receptor Modulation Optimized for
Response) trial is a phase 1/2 study evaluating the safety
and MTD of daily treatment with TOK-001 in men with
CRPC. The second phase of the trial (ARMOR2) will
enroll approximately 40 CRPC patients who will receive
1 of 2 target dosing regimens as identified by the phase 1
results.
Summary and Future Directions
With antitumor activity demonstrated across a wide
mechanistic spectrum including novel hormonal maneuvers (Table 1), immunotherapy, and chemotherapeutics
(Table 2), the management of CRPC is currently undergoing significant transformation. Manipulation of the
hormonal axis remains the cornerstone of treatment, with
novel adrenal androgen inhibitors demonstrating robust
antitumor activity. These agents are now being tested in
earlier disease stages to hopefully augment existing
approaches. Immunotherapy still faces challenges with
regard to exact antitumor mechanism, patient selection,
and lack of intermediate clinical endpoints to inform clinical decision-making. As a result, a more precise mechanistic understanding of the antitumor effect of
immunotherapy is needed to advance this approach. New
chemotherapeutic approaches have demonstrated clinical
benefit, but with challenges remaining regarding the management of toxicity. As is true across solid tumor oncology, robust predictive biomarkers to select specific
patients for specific approaches based on anticipated benefit and/or risk is needed to further build upon the latest
wave of therapeutic advances.
