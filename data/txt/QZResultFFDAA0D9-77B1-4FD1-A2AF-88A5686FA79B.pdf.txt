BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to characterize trends and survival outcomes for chemotherapy in the definitive
and adjuvant treatment of hypopharyngeal cancer in the United States. METHODS: A total of 16,248 adult patients diagnosed with
primary hypopharyngeal cancer without distant metastases between 1998 and 2011 were identified in the National Cancer Data Base.
The association between treatment modality and overall survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and 5-year survival
rates. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed on a subset of 3357 cases to determine the treatment modalities that
predict improved survival when controlling for demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the use
of chemotherapy with radiotherapy both as definitive treatment (P<.001) and as adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with surgery (P5.001).
This was accompanied by a decrease in total laryngectomy/pharyngectomy rates (P<.001). Chemoradiotherapy was associated with
improved 5-year survival compared with radiotherapy alone in the definitive setting (31.8% vs 25.2%; log rank P<.001). Similarly, in
multivariateanalysis, definitive radiotherapy was found to be associated with compromised survival compared with definitive chemoradiotherapy (hazard ratio, 1.51; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Survival analysis revealed that overall 5-year survival rates were higher for
chemoradiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in the definitive setting, but were comparable between surgery with chemoraC 2016 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Hypopharyngeal cancers represent 3% to 4% of all cancers of the head and neck, with an estimated 3400 new cases arising
in the United States annually.1-3 Although relatively rare, the prognosis for patients with hypopharyngeal cancers is among
the worst for cancers of the head and neck.2-4 In the United States, these cancers are often not readily visualized or palpated
and can be asymptomatic until they reach advanced stages.5
Over the past 2 decades, the indications for the use of chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with hypopharyngeal cancer have shifted. The basis for this change was the results of several clinical trials, namely the Veterans Affairs trial
and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial 24891 in the definitive setting and
EORTC trial 22931 and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 9501 in the adjuvant setting.6-10 In response
to these trials, the inclusion of chemotherapy with radiotherapy has increasingly become the standard for locally advanced
hypopharyngeal cancers both in the definitive and adjuvant settings.11
In a previous study analyzing a cohort of 3958 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we confirmed an expected decrease in the rate of laryngopharyngectomies for
patients with hypopharyngeal cancers, accompanied by an increase in definitive radiation-based treatment.12 The changes
in treatment modality were not found to be associated with compromised survival, and we hypothesized that one contributing factor in survival trends was improved outcomes associated with the rise of chemotherapy. The objective of the current study was to characterize the frequencies and trends for chemotherapy when used with radiation as definitive therapy

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data originated from the National Cancer Data Base
(NCDB) from 1998 to 2011. The NCDB is a nationwide
clinical surveillance resource data set that includes approximately 70% of all newly diagnosed malignancies in the
United States from >1500 cancer programs. Begun in
1989, the NCDB is a joint project of the American Cancer Society and the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons. Data collection is performed
under the data use agreement between Commission on
Cancer-accredited hospitals and the American College of
Surgeons. This study was determined to be exempt from
institutional review by the Institutional Human Investigation Committee.
We identified cases of squamous cell cancer with a
primary site in the hypopharynx using International Classification of Disease for Oncology, 3rd Edition (ICD-O-3)
topography codes C12.9 to C13.9 and histology codes
8050 to 8089. We excluded patients if they were aged
<18 years at the time of diagnosis, had a primary tumor
1854

that could not be found, had had previous malignancies,
or had distant metastases, resulting in a cohort of 16,248
cases.
The demographic variables analyzed were year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, sex, race, insurance status, and
comorbidity. Age was stratified into aged 18 to 54 years,
aged 55 to 64 years, aged 65 to 74 years, aged 75 to 84
years, and aged 85 years. Race was stratified into white,
non-Hispanic; African/African American; Hispanic;
Asian/Pacific Islander; and unknown/other. Insurance
status was stratified into private insurance; Medicaid,
Medicare, or other government insurance; and no insurance. Comorbidity was measured by the Charlson/Deyo
Comorbidity Score, with 0 corresponding to no comorbidity; 1 to cardiovascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, rheumatologic disease, peptic ulcer
disease, mild liver disease, or diabetes; and 2 to diabetes
with chronic complications, hemiplegia or paraplegia, renal disease, moderate or severe liver disease, or the
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
The clinical variables analyzed were cancer stage and
treatment modality. Clinical cancer stage was classified by
tumor size (T1, T2, T3, T4, and Tis) and lymph node status (N0, N1, N2, and N3) according to the American

guidelines.13 For treatment modality, we defined definitive surgery as undergoing a pharyngectomy and/or laryngectomy and radiotherapy as receiving external beam
radiotherapy. Patients were considered to have received
chemotherapy if they received any chemotherapy as part
of their first course of therapy, regardless of the type or
number of agents used. The category of surgery with chemoradiotherapy included patients who received both
induction chemotherapy and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Induction chemotherapy was defined as chemotherapy that began >30 days before the initiation of
radiotherapy. Concomitant chemotherapy was defined as
chemotherapy that began within 30 days before or 45
days after the initiation of radiotherapy. Positive surgical
margins were defined as microscopic or macroscopic residual tumor. The primary outcome was survival time
from the date of diagnosis to the date the patient died or
the date of last contact up to December 31, 2011.
Statistical Analysis

The year of diagnosis and frequencies of treatment modalities were analyzed by linear regression to determine significant trends in treatments over time. Overall survival
was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank tests
for significant differences, as well as by 5-year survival
rates compared by 2-tailed Student t tests. Factors that
Cancer

June 15, 2016

were found to be significant on bivariate analyses were
included in a multivariate Cox regression to identify predictors of survival. The subset in the Cox regression analysis included 3357 cases from 2003 to 2006; this cohort
began in 2003 because it was the first year in which the
Charlson/Deyo Comorbidity Score was collected, and it
ended in 2006 so that patients with <5 years of follow-up
were not included in multivariate survival analysis. Statistical significance was determined at the P<.05 level. All
data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software (version 22.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).
RESULTS
Temporal Trends in Treatment Modalities

Approximately 6.4% of patients had distant metastases
and were excluded from analysis, resulting in a cohort of
16,248 patients with primary hypopharyngeal cancer; the
demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients
are described in Tables 1 and 2. The majority of patients
were male (78.8%) and white (74.8%), with a mean age
of 63.0 years. Human papillomavirus status was only
available for 2.5% of patients and was not included in the
analysis. The most common treatment modality was chemoradiotherapy (48.2%), followed by radiotherapy alone
(18.3%). Approximately 15.9% of patients received definitive surgery (Table 2).
Although the rate of radiotherapy remained relatively stable between 1998 and 2011 (P 5 .091), the rate
of surgery declined (P<.001) and the rate of chemotherapy at any point increased in frequency (P<.001) (see
online Supporting Information Fig. 1). This increase in
the use of chemotherapy was observed in both the definitive and adjuvant settings. When patients who received
noncurative treatment modalities (no treatment or chemotherapy alone) were excluded, there were significant
increases noted in the frequencies of chemoradiotherapy
(P<.001) and surgery with chemoradiotherapy (P 5
.001). Radiotherapy alone (P<.001), surgery alone (P 5
.001), and surgery with radiotherapy (P<.001) were
found to have decreased (Fig. 1).
Survival Rates for Chemotherapy in the
Definitive and Adjuvant Settings

The overall 5-year survival rate for the patients in the current study from 1998 to 2006 was 26.0%. When divided
into 3-year intervals, the 5-year survival rate was 34.2% in
2004 through 2006 compared with 26.5% in 1998
through 2000 (log rank P5.009) and 33.2% in 2001
through 2003 (log rank P5.065). Kaplan-Meier curves

are shown in Figure 2.
Survival for chemotherapy in the definitive and
adjuvant settings was further investigated. Overall, the
5-year survival rate for patients who received chemotherapy was 31.0% compared with 25.6% for patients who
did not (log rank P<.001). Of the patients who received
radiotherapy and chemotherapy, 22.1% received induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and 77.9%
1856

received concomitant chemoradiotherapy. The 5-year survival rate was not found to be significantly different
between the 2 categories (31.6% for those receiving
induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy vs 33.2%
for those receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy;
P 5 .857), and therefore these were grouped into 1 definitive chemoradiotherapy category in subsequent analysis.
The 5-year survival rate associated with definitive chemoradiotherapy was significantly higher compared with that
for radiotherapy alone (31.8% for chemoradiotherapy vs
25.2% for radiotherapy without chemotherapy; log rank
P<.001).
A total of 606 patients received surgery with chemoradiotherapy; of the 316 patients for whom the sequence
of therapy was known, approximately 15.8% of patients
received induction chemotherapy and 84.2% received
postoperative chemotherapy. Because these modalities
combined represented only 4.9% of the total number of
patients, they were grouped into 1 category of surgery
with chemoradiotherapy in subsequent analysis. No significant difference in 5-year survival rates was found
between surgery with chemoradiotherapy and surgery
with radiotherapy (33.6% vs 34.4%, respectively; log
rank P5.861) (Fig. 3).
Survival Analysis

A total of 4249 cases diagnosed between 2003 and 2006
were eligible for multivariate survival analysis, 3357 of
which did not have any missing values. The demographic
and clinical characteristics of this subset of patients are
shown in Tables 1 and 2. In bivariate analysis, year of

diagnosis, age, race, insurance status, comorbidity, T classification, and N classification were all found to have significantly increased hazard ratios (HRs) (Table 3). There
were no significant differences associated with survival
when comparing chemoradiotherapy with surgery, with
surgery with radiotherapy, or with surgery with chemoradiotherapy, but HRs were improved compared with radiotherapy alone, chemotherapy alone, and no treatment.
The variables that were found to be associated with
significant differences in survival were included in a multivariate Cox survival regression analysis (Table 3). Year of
diagnosis, insurance status, comorbidity, T classification,
and N classification were still found to be significantly
associated with increased HRs. When controlling for
these other factors, relative to chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy alone (HR, 1.51; P<.001), chemotherapy (HR,
1.90; P<.001), and no treatment (HR, 2.25; P<.001)
were all found to be associated with worse survival. There
was no significant difference with survival associated with
surgery alone (HR, 1.12; P 5 .402), whereas surgery with
radiotherapy (HR, 0.772; P 5 .028) and surgery with
chemoradiotherapy (HR, 0.693; P 5 .005) were found to
be associated with improved survival compared with chemoradiotherapy. When surgery with chemoradiotherapy
was used as the reference variable in a second analysis,
there was no significant difference in survival found to be
associated with surgery with radiotherapy and no chemotherapy (HR, 1.11; P 5 .529). A sensitivity analysis was
performed to confirm that a survival advantage was still
associated with adjuvant radiotherapy in the definitive setting when only including chemoradiotherapy performed

concomitantly, as well as in the subset of patients aged
<64 years.
Positive margins after surgery and extracapsular
extension are 2 indications for the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. Extracapsular extension was only known for
2.6% of patients and therefore was not evaluated. We
investigated whether there were differences in survival for
the 334 patients who had positive margins after surgery.
When survival curves were compared by the log-rank test,
improved survival was found to be associated with surgery
with radiation compared with surgery alone (P 5 .000),
but there was no significant difference noted between surgery with chemoradiation versus surgery with radiation
(P 5 .101). When controlling for surgical margin status,
age, T classification, N classification, and year of diagnosis
in Cox survival regression analysis, there was no significant difference in survival noted for surgery with radiotherapy compared with surgery with chemoradiotherapy
(HR, 0.991; P 5 .943), but these findings were likely limited by the small sample size.
DISCUSSION
In a previous study using SEER population-based data,
we demonstrated a decrease in laryngopharyngectomies
accompanied by an increase in radiation-based treatment,
without compromised survival outcomes.12 These findings were subsequently reported by others as well.14 However, the SEER database does not include chemotherapy
data, and therefore we were unable to evaluate the survival
outcomes for chemotherapy. In the current study, we
demonstrated that the increased use of radiotherapy is

primarily in conjunction with chemotherapy. Although
overall radiotherapy rates have generally been consistent,
there has been an increase noted in the use of chemotherapy
both in the definitive and adjuvant settings. Survival analysis revealed that overall 5-year survival rates were higher for
chemoradiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in
the definitive setting, but were comparable between surgery
with chemoradiotherapy and surgery with radiotherapy.
These findings were replicated when controlling for year of
diagnosis, age, insurance status, comorbidity, T classification, and N classification in multivariate analysis.

The increasing use of chemoradiotherapy for
patients with hypopharyngeal cancers has been driven by
clinical trial data supporting the use of definitive and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. In the definitive setting, the
1991 Veterans Affairs trial compared induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with surgery followed
by radiotherapy for patients with laryngeal cancer and
found comparable survival outcomes.10 Specifically
among patients with hypopharyngeal cancers, EORTC
trial 24891 also compared induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with surgery and similarly did not

find inferior survival with the organ-preserving
approach.6,7 RTOG trial 9111 then compared induction
chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with both concomitant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy alone in
patients with locally advanced laryngeal cancer, finding
that locoregional control was improved in the concomitant chemotherapy arm.15,16
In the adjuvant setting, EORTC trial 22931 and
RTOG trial 9501 resulted in improved outcomes for adjuvant chemoradiotherapy compared with adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with head and neck cancers.8,9 With
EORTC trial 22931, disease-free survival, overall survival,
and locoregional control were all improved in the adjuvant
chemoradiotherapy arm. In contrast, RTOG trial 9501
demonstrated improved locoregional control and diseasefree survival without an overall survival benefit. Further
analysis of both studies identified extracapsular extension
and positive surgical margins as the risk factors with significantly improved outcomes after adjuvant chemoradiation.17
Aggregating many trials, the Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC) group found
improved disease-free survival and lower locoregional failure
rates for concomitant chemoradiotherapy over induction
chemotherapy.18,19 In a follow-up analysis based on tumor
subsite, chemotherapy resulted in an improvement in
locoregional control for all tumor subsites, but the study
was only able to demonstrate a benefit for concomitant chemoradiotherapy in the larynx and oropharynx, not the oral
cavity or hypopharynx.20 It is interesting to note that hypopharyngeal cancers comprised a small percentage of patients
in the trials studying adjuvant chemoradiotherapy, representing 20% of patients in EORTC trial 22931 and 10% of
patients in RTOG trial 9501, and therefore these subset
analyses have limited power.
There are limitations inherent to a study that uses
secondary source data from a large database. Coding
errors are a concern, and several cases were excluded from
the multivariate analysis because of missing data values;
the effects of these missing data on the data set are
unknown. There are many centers and physicians represented in this data set and therefore there is likely variation
in how the surgery or chemoradiotherapy were performed. In particular, we were not able to distinguish
chemotherapy by the number of agents, types of agents,
or duration of treatment, nor did we have enough patients
to differentiate between induction and adjuvant chemotherapy in our analysis of patients who underwent surgery.
We also were only able to evaluate comorbidity using the
Charlson/Deyo Comorbidity Score, whereas clinical trials
usually rely instead on Karnofsky scores. Another limitaCancer

tion of the data set is that disease-specific survival and
locoregional failure rates were not assessed and therefore
the only primary outcome was overall survival; given the
elderly patient population, patients may have passed away
from unrelated causes.21-23 In addition, although we controlled for factors such as age, comorbidity, and disease
stage, specific indications for chemoradiation or radiation
alone may not have been captured (eg, extracapsular
extension in postoperative patients and unresectability in
definitive stages). Patients with several features of more
aggressive tumors were likely treated with chemoradiotherapy rather than radiotherapy in the postoperative setting, as per guidelines. The differential use of
chemotherapy by risk group and small sample size limits
the interpretability of the data concerning chemotherapy
in the postoperative setting.
The results of the current study provide further support for a survival benefit associated with chemotherapy
when added to radiotherapy in the definitive setting. We
were not able to detect a similar benefit for the addition of
chemotherapy to radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting.
The interpretation of the latter finding is limited by the
nonrandomized nature of the data used. Our current
understanding of hypopharyngeal cancer is that it represents a biologically heterogeneous group of tumors, and as
the importance of factors such as human papillomavirus,
ERCC-1, and epidermal growth factor receptor is elucidated, treatment modalities can continue to be tailored
and optimized.
