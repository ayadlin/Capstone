SUMMARY

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Ferroptosis is a form of nonapoptotic cell death for which key regulators remain unknown. We
sought a common mediator for the lethality of 12 ferroptosisinducing small molecules. We used
targeted metabolomic profiling to discover that depletion of glutathione causes inactivation of
glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) in response to one class of compounds and a chemoproteomics
strategy to discover that GPX4 is directly inhibited by a second class of compounds. GPX4
overexpression and knockdown modulated the lethality of 12 ferroptosis inducers, but not of 11
compounds with other lethal mechanisms. In addition, two representative ferroptosis inducers
prevented tumor growth in xenograft mouse tumor models. Sensitivity profiling in 177 cancer cell
lines revealed that diffuse large B cell lymphomas and renal cell carcinomas are particularly
susceptible to GPX4-regulated ferroptosis. Thus, GPX4 is an essential regulator of ferroptotic
cancer cell death.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells can undergo regulated forms of cell death in a variety of contexts (Galluzzi et al.,
2012), including during development (Penaloza et al., 2006). Activation of alternative
regulated cell death mechanisms may be beneficial for treating diseases such as cancer, in
which apoptotic cell death mechanisms are suppressed due to genetic alterations. Indeed,
activation of alternative cell death pathways may overcome the drug resistance associated
with existing chemotherapeutic agents, providing new drug targets.
Regulators of apoptosis have been targeted with small molecules to induce cell death in
cancer cells (Cotter, 2009). Recently, regulated, nonapoptotic cell death processes have been
discovered, including necroptosis (Degterev et al., 2005) and ferroptosis (Dixon et al.,
2012).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Ferroptosis is a mode of cell death involving the production of iron-dependent reactive
oxygen species (ROS). In engineered human fibroblast cell lines, the small molecule erastin
was found to induce preferential lethality in cells overexpressing oncogenic HRAS (Dolma
et al., 2003). Erastin-induced ferroptotic cell death was distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and
autophagy, based on morphological, biochemical, and genetic criteria. Ferroptosis involves
metabolic dysfunction that results in the production of both cytosolic and lipid ROS,
independent of mitochondria but dependent on NADPH oxidases in some cell contexts
(Dixon et al., 2012).
We have reported the identification of additional small molecules, named RSL3 (Yang and
Stockwell, 2008a), ML162, and DPI10 (Weïwer et al., 2012), that display oncogenic-RASsynthetic-lethality (the RSL phenotype) in engineered fibro-blast-derived tumorigenic cell
lines. Here, we sought to test whether these and other compounds also induce ferroptosis,
and whether they could be used to elucidate a central regulator of ferroptosis, which controls
cell death by all FIN (ferroptosis inducing) compounds.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We focused initially on erastin and RSL3. Erastin reprograms cancer cell metabolism by
modulating VDAC2/VDAC3 (Yagoda et al., 2007) and system xc– (Dixon et al., 2012) to
trigger ferroptosis, whereas RSL3-induced ferroptosis is not dependent on these factors
(Yang and Stockwell, 2008a) but results in a similar downstream cell death phenotype.
Thus, we viewed erastin and RSL3 as ideal probes to elucidate conserved downstream
regulators of ferroptosis. We used metabolomic profiling to evaluate comprehensively
changes in metabolism occurring upon erastin treatment, and chemoproteomics to identify
candidate target proteins for RSL3, which led to the discovery of a common pathway
regulating cell death in response to all known compounds that induce ferroptosis.

RESULTS
Erastin Depletes Glutathione to Trigger Selective Ferroptosis
To investigate the global changes in metabolism induced by erastin, we treated HT-1080
fibrosarcoma cells with DMSO or erastin, and extracted polar and lipid metabolites. The
metabolite extract was subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-

MS/MS) analysis to determine the quantity 149 polar and 115 lipid metabolites (Table S1
available online; Figure 1A). Both reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione
(GSSG) were depleted significantly upon erastin treatment, whereas the level of
lysophosphatidyl cholines (lysoPCs) was increased; the increase in lysoPCs may reflect the
generation of lipid ROS during erastin-induced ferroptosis because PCs have been found to
be converted to lysoPCs (deacylated PCs) upon lipid oxidation (Parthasarathy et al., 1985).
The significant depletion of GSH/GSSG was consistent with the fact that erastin induces the
formation of ROS, causing an oxidative cell death. GSH/GSSG constitutes a major cellular
anti-oxidant system and provides reducing equivalents to eliminate oxidative species. We
treated three cell lines with erastin, determined GSH levels using Ellman's reagent, and
confirmed the dose-dependent, GSH-depleting effect of erastin (Figures 1B and S1A). We
found that GSH depletion by erastin is necessary for erastin's lethality because
supplementing the culture medium with GSH or N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a biosynthetic
precursor to GSH, prevented erastin-induced cell death (Figure S1B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We sought to test further whether the glutathione-depleting activity of erastin was essential
for lethality. We established a synthetic route to create six erastin analogs (see Data S1 for
synthesis) and tested these analogs for selective lethality in BJ-derived engineered cell lines
(Figure 1C). Three compounds (MEII, PE, and AE) retained selective lethality, whereas
three compounds (A8, PYR, and dMK) were not lethal (Figure 1C). Lethal analogs of
erastin depleted cellular GSH more effectively than nonlethal analogs of erastin (Figure 1D),
which further suggested that the GSH-depleting activity of erastin is necessary for erastin
lethality.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We reasoned that, if GSH depletion was contributing to erastin's lethality, then GSH
depletion by other reagents might partially mimic erastin's selective lethality in the BJ-cell
line system, which consists of isogenic cell lines (two with and two without oncogenic
HRAS), through which ferroptosis-inducing compounds such as erastin were discovered.
When the four BJ-derived cells were treated with BSO, an oncogenic HRAS-selective lethal
phenotype was observed under conditions of low cell density (Figure 1E), suggesting that
GSH depletion is sufficient for induction of ferroptosis in BJ cells with oncogenic HRAS
overexpression, although additional factors may enhance the potency and efficacy of the
lethality caused by GSH depletion under more general circumstances. These results
indicated that erastin depletes GSH through preventing cystine uptake via inhibition of
system xc– (Dixon et al., 2012).
Erastin Inactivates GPX Enzymes through GSH Depletion
Given that we found GSH depletion to be critical for erastin-induced ferroptosis, we
investigated how GSH depletion by erastin was able to induce selective lethality in the
engineered BJ cell lines. It has been hypothesized that most cancer cells, including RAStransformed fibroblasts (Irani et al., 1997), are under high levels of oxidative stress
(Szatrowski and Nathan, 1991), which therefore needs to be counteracted by increasing the
ROS-scavenging capacity, to prevent oxidative damage (Hussain et al., 2003). In this model,
targeting ROS-scavenging systems through multiple points, including GSH depletion, would
cause an imbalance in this equilibrium, leading to oxidative cell death (Trachootham et al.,
Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 January 16.

2006). In order to test whether this simple hypothesis could explain erastin's selective
lethality, we examined basal ROS levels in the BJ-derived engineered cell lines using
H2DCF, a cytosolic ROS sensor, and confirmed that BJeLR cells have modestly elevated
ROS levels compared to BJeH (BJ-TERT) and BJeHLT (BJ-TERT/LT/ST) cells (Figure
2A). We then treated the four BJ-derived cell lines with an SOD inhibitor (DETC), a thiolreactive reagent (DIA), a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor (DCNB), or a catalase inhibitor
(ATZ) (Figures 2B and S2). Three of these antioxidant inhibitors (DETC, DIA, and DCNB)
killed BJ-derived cells, but they neither depleted GSH nor displayed selective lethality,
which was in contrast to the two GSH-depleting reagents, erastin and BSO (Figures 2B, 2C,
and S2). The results indicate that it is not possible to induce selective ferroptosis in the BJderived cell lines by simply targeting the antioxidant network. Instead, unique biochemical
and metabolic changes downstream of GSH depletion were likely to be responsible for the
selective induction of ferroptosis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The degree of GSH depletion upon erastin treatment in the four BJ cell lines was also
examined (Figure 2D). We found that these four BJ-derived cell lines contained varying
amounts of basal GSH in the absence of any treatment, as reported previously by Kang and
Enger (1992), but were depleted of GSH to a similar extent upon erastin treatment. The
concentration of erastin used in this experiment (10 μM) was lethal to BJeLR and DRD cells
(expressing HRASV12) but was not lethal to BJeH and BJeHLT cells (with wild-type RAS),
even upon prolonged incubation (Figure 2B). Therefore, the selective lethality among these
cell lines was not caused by differential depletion of GSH or by differences in the basal level
of GSH.
We then treated BJeLR cells with either GSH-depleting reagents (erastin or BSO) or other
antioxidant-targeting re-agents (DETC, DIA, and DCNB), and stained cells with either
BODIPY-C11, a membrane-targeted lipid ROS sensor, or H2DCF, a cytoplasmic ROS
sensor, to detect changes in ROS accumulation upon compound treatment (Figure 2E).
GSH-depleting reagents strongly increased BODIPY-C11 and H2DCF signals, whereas
other antioxidant inhibitors did not increase the fluorescence signals from either ROS
sensor, indicating that both cytosolic and lipid ROS levels were increased selectively by
GSH depletion in the oncogenic HRAS-containing cell lines (Figure 2E).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We considered that one consequence of GSH depletion could be inactivation of glutathionedependent peroxidases (GPXs). GPXs catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and
organic hydroperoxides to water or the corresponding alcohols, using GSH as an essential
cofactor (Brigelius-Flohé and Maiorino, 2013).
The total activity of GPXs in BJeLR cells was examined using tert-butylhydroperoxide
(tBuOOH) as a substrate, by monitoring the rate of NADPH oxidation, which is coupled to
the tBuOOH-reducing activity of GPXs in cell lysates. When BJeLR cell lysates treated with
vehicle only (0.08% DMSO) were added to the GPX activity assay, we observed a decrease
in the amount of NADPH, indicating that tBuOOH was reduced by GPXs in the cell lysate
(Figure 2F). Treatment of BJeLR cells with antioxidant inhibitors (DETC, DIA, and DCNB)
did not affect GPX activity because the rate of NADPH oxidation was similar to the vehicleonly-treated sample.

When lysates from BJeLR cells that had been treated with GSH-depleting reagents (erastin
or BSO) were analyzed, NADPH oxidation was prevented, indicating that GPXs were
inactivated upon GSH depletion (Figure 2F). Taken together, these data indicate that erastin
and BSO inactivate cellular GPXs, leading to the generation of cytoplasmic and lipid ROS.
Other antioxidant inhibitors did not deplete GSH, an essential cofactor for GPX enzyme
activity, and therefore, did not inhibit GPX activity and did not cause accumulation of
peroxides.
RSL3 Binds to and Inactivates GPX4
Having determined that erastin acts by depleting GSH and inhibiting GPXs, we examined
the mechanism of action of RSL3, another ferroptosis inducer (Yang and Stockwell, 2008a).
Cell death induced by erastin and RSL3 shared common ferroptotic features, such as iron,
MEK, and ROS dependence; however, RSL3 was not dependent on VDAC2/VDAC3 or
system xc– implying that a different initiating mechanism could converge on a similar form
of ferroptotic cell death. We thus used RSL3 as a probe to illuminate the shared downstream
mechanism involved in executing ferroptosis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

When we examined cellular GSH levels during RSL3-induced cell death, we found that
GSH remained unaffected by a lethal RSL3 concentration (2 μM) in BJeLR cells, which was
in contrast to erastin's effect (Figure 3A). However, BODIPY-C11 staining revealed the
generation of lipid ROS in RSL3-treated BJeLR cells, which indicated that lipid oxidation is
common to both erastin-induced and RSL3-induced ferroptotic cell death (Figure 3B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to understand the mechanistic basis of RSL3's enigmatic induction of lipid ROS in
the absence of GSH depletion, we used affinity-based chemoproteomics to identify
candidate target proteins for RSL3. We discovered that the chloroacetamide moiety of RSL3
was essential for its activity and that replacement with other electrophiles resulted in a loss
of potency (Table S2; see Data S1 for synthesis). These data suggested that RSL3 targets an
enzyme with a nucleophilic active site, such as serine, threonine, cysteine, or selenocysteine.
Despite the potential for promiscuous reactivity of the chloroacetamide, we discovered that
only the (1S, 3R)-RSL3 diastereomer of RSL3 exhibited selective lethality in the BJ cell
system, whereas the three other diastereomers of RSL3 lacked selectivity and were more
than 100-fold less potent (Figures 3C and 3D; Table S2; Data S1 for synthesis). These
results suggested that (1S, 3R)-RSL3 covalently binds to one or more proteins to induce the
potent and selective lethality observed in BJ cells expressing HRASV12.
Affinity reagents were synthesized by attaching an isobutyrylprotected fluorescein tag via a
polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker to the phenyl substituent at the 1 position in the
tetrahydro-β-carboline ring system of RSL3, which was found to tolerate structural
modifications. Despite a loss in potency upon incorporation of the affinity tag, 10-fold
oncogenic HRAS selectivity was retained for an affinity analog with the active (1S, 3R)
stereo-chemistry, whereas an affinity analog with the (1R, 3R) stereo-chemistry showed no
activity (Figures 3E and 3F; see Data S1 for synthesis).
Samples for proteomic analysis were prepared by treating intact BJeLR cells with (1S, 3R)RSL3-fluorescein (active probe treatment), (1R, 3R)-RSL3-fluorescein (inactive probe

treatment), or (1S, 3R)-RSL3-fluorescein pretreated with free (1S, 3R)-RSL3 (competitor
treatment). Treated cells were lysed, and fluorescein-tagged proteins were affinity purified
using Sepharose beads coupled to an anti-fluorescein antibody. Eluted proteins were
identified with a Synapt G2 HDMS mass spectrometer (Waters) using a quantitative labelfree shotgun proteomic strategy with data-independent scanning (MSE) and ion mobility
spectrometry (see Extended Experimental Procedures).
Proteins enriched in “active probe” versus “inactive probe” and “active probe” versus
“competitor” treatments were determined (Figure 3G). Three independent affinity
preparations of each of these treatments were further subsampled in three LCMS/MS
analyses (Table S2). Candidates were chosen on the basis of (1) exhibiting enrichment in
both active:inactive and active:competitor comparisons with p < 0.01 (with false discovery
rate correction; see Extended Experimental Procedures) and (2) identification and
quantitation by n > 2 tryptic peptides. This analysis ranked GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4,
PhGPx) as the top candidate protein target for (1S, 3R)-RSL3 (Figure 3G; Table S2).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It was intriguing that GPX4 was identified as the most highly ranked candidate in our
unbiased chemoproteomic approach to find target proteins for RSL3 because erastin
inhibited cellular GPX enzymes through GSH depletion (Figures 1 and 2). We confirmed
that GPX4 was purified specifically by the affinity analog (1S, 3R)-RSL3-fluorescein, using
fresh samples prepared from BJeLR cells treated with the active probe, the inactive probe, or
the competitor as before, analyzed for GPX4 abundance by western blot (Figures 3H and
S3A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to examine whether RSL3 binding to GPX4 inactivates the peroxidase activity of
GPX4, we treated a clone of the COH BR1 breast cancer cell line overexpressing GPX4
(L7G4), with (1S, 3R)-RSL3 or vehicle only, prepared cell lysates, and incubated them with
7α-cholesterol hydroperoxide (7α-cholesterol-OOH) to determine the rate of reduction to
the corresponding alcohol (7α-cholesterol-OH). 7α-cholesterol-OOH is a specific substrate
for GPX4; no other GPX enzyme can catalyze the reduction of 7α-cholesterol-OOH (Kriska
and Girotti, 2005). In vehicle-treated samples, 7α-cholesterol-OOH decreased over time in a
GSH-dependent manner, due to reduction by GPX4 in the lysate. Upon treatment with (1S,
3R)-RSL3, however, no reduction of 7α-cholesterol-OOH was observed, indicating that
GPX4 was inhibited by (1S, 3R)-RSL3 (Figure 3I; see Figure S3B for quantitation data).
Treatment with the inactive diastereomer (1R, 3R)-RSL3 did not inhibit GPX4 activity
(Figure S3C).
We used another proteomics data analysis tool, Elucidator (Rosetta Biosoftware), and found
that only GPX4 was a significantly enriched protein common to both TransOmics and
Elucidator analysis algorithms (Figure S3D). Evaluation of other candidates using specific
siRNAs and shRNAs failed to show either modulation of (1S, 3R)-RSL3 sensitivity or cell
killing (Figures S3E–S3I), which excludes the functional role of these other binding proteins
on ferroptosis induced by (1S, 3R)-RSL3.

RNAi-Mediated GPX4 Knockdown Induces Ferroptosis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that, if RSL3 were to inhibit a protein essential for cancer cell viability,
then reducing the levels of this protein would sensitize cells to RSL3. Silencing of GPX4
mRNA using shRNAs that cause partial knockdown of GPX4 strongly sensitized cells to
(1S, 3R)-RSL3 (Figure 4A). Conversely, when we overexpressed GPX4, we found that it
caused strong resistance to (1S, 3R)-RSL3 lethality (Figure 4B), as expected for a relevant
target protein.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We were able to achieve a more effective knockdown of GPX4 using a pool of siRNAs
targeting GPX4 (20-fold decrease in the GPX4 mRNA; Figure S4A) compared to a single
clone of shRNA (5-fold decrease in the GPX4 mRNA; Figure 4A). With this more effective
knockdown, HT-1080 cells underwent cell death with accompanying lipid ROS generation
(Figure 4C). Cell death induced by siGPX4 was rescued by the same suppressors of RSL3—
an iron chelator (DFOM), a MEK inhibitor (U0126), and an antioxidant (vitamin E [Vit. E])
—which suggested that GPX4 knockdown induced ferroptotic cell death (Figure 4D) similar
to RSL3. None of these ferroptosis inhibitors suppressed cell death induced by siDeath, a
control siRNA pool targeting multiple essential genes, highlighting the ferroptosis-specific
action of these inhibitors (Figure 4D). Furthermore, siGPX4 induced selective cell death in
BJeLR and DRD cells (with HRASV12), but not BJeH and BJeHLT cells (wild-type HRAS),
which recapitulated the selective lethality of erastin and RSL3 (Figures 4E and S4B). These
data suggested that GPX4 is the primary target of RSL3, mediating its ability to induce
ferroptosis specifically in the oncogenic HRAS-containing BJ-derived fibroblasts.
There are eight isoforms of GPXs in humans with different tissue expression and substrate
specificities. In BJeLR cells, six GPX isoforms are expressed (GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, GPX4,
GPX7, and GPX8) as determined by RT-qPCR (Figure S4C). Knockdown of each isoform
affected cell viability to varying levels; however, GPX4 knockdown was the most lethal to
BJeLR cells, which highlights the prominent role of GPX4 inhibition in inducing cell death,
as compared to other GPX enzymes (Figures 4F and S4D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Taken together, these data suggest that GPX4 is a central regulator of ferroptosis induced by
erastin and RSL3. Cell death was enhanced in the BJ-derived cell lines expressing HRASV12
due to the increased basal ROS (Figure 2A) and enhanced lipid peroxidation after GPX4
inhibition, which caused selective lethality in this engineered isogenic cell line model.
GPX4 Regulates Ferroptosis Induced by 12 Divergent Compounds
In a larger screening campaign to find additional FIN compounds, 14 candidate compounds
were discovered out of more than a million tested (Figure 5A; see Figure S5 for structures)
(Weïwer et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012). These 14 compounds displayed selective lethality
in HRASV12-expressing cells in the four BJ-derived cell lines (Figure 5A; Table S3). We
defined ten structurally diverse FIN groups, not including erastin or RSL3 (Figure 5A), to
use in subsequent experiments.
BJeLR cells treated with each of the ten additional FIN compounds exhibited an increase in
BODIPY-C11 fluorescence, indicating that lipid ROS were generated (Table S3 for
individual flow cytometry data). We then tested 11 non-FIN compounds acting through

diverse lethal mechanisms to see whether they induced lipid ROS generation using this
assay (Table S3 for more information of 11 non-FIN compounds). These 11 diverse lethal
compounds were confirmed to lack selective lethality in the four BJ-derived cell lines
previously (Root et al., 2003), which suggested that they are not ferroptosis inducers. We
found that 10 out of 11 of the non-FIN compounds did not generate lipid ROS, implying a
specificity of lipid ROS generation for FIN compound-treated cells (Table S3 for individual
flow cytometry data). It is likely that the reported ROS-generating activity of phenylarsine
oxide was responsible for the oxidation of the BODIPY-C11 dye (Fanélus and Desrosiers,
2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to determine whether these FIN compounds genuinely induced ferroptosis, the
functional requirement of lipid ROS during ferroptosis was examined by treating BJeLR
cells with each lethal compound (FINs and non-FINs) in the presence of a lipophilic
antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). BHT strongly suppressed cell death induced
by all FIN compounds (Table S3 for individual growth inhibition curves). The rescuing
effect of BHT was specific to FIN compounds because BHT was not able to suppress cell
death induced by 12 non-FIN compounds (Table S3 for individual growth inhibition curves).
We quantified the degree of cell death suppression by calculating the normalized differences
in the AUC (area under the concentration-response curve) of the compound alone and that
of the compound with BHT. Combined with the BODIPY-C11 staining data, these results
revealed that the FIN compounds are mechanistically distinct from the 11 non-FIN
compounds (Figure 5B). An extended death mechanism analysis using the modulatory
profiling approach (Wolpaw et al., 2011) with four selected FIN compounds (erastin, PE,
DPI2, and DPI10) revealed that they induced a similar form of cell death that was distinct
from non-FIN compounds (Figure 5C). Taken together, these data indicate that compounds
that display the RSL phenotype in the four-BJ cell system are ferroptosis inducers. These
data also suggest that ferroptotic cell death is not limited to erastin and RSL3 but that a
number of additional small molecules can be identified that induce ferroptosis, suggesting
that it may be a more generally important mechanism of lethality.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to determine the generality of ferroptosis regulation by GPX4, we treated HT-1080
cells with each lethal compound (FIN compound or non-FIN compound) under a GPX4inhibited condition (using BSO treatment, which depletes glutathione and therefore inhibits
all GPXs), or a GPX4-upregulated condition (by overexpressing GPX4). GPX4 inhibition
using BSO enhanced ferroptotic cell death induced by all FIN compounds, whereas GPX4
overexpression suppressed ferroptosis induced by all FIN compounds (Figure 5D and Table
S3). The modulation effect of BSO and GPX4 overexpression was specific to FIN
compounds because their effects on cell death induced by 11 non-FIN compounds were
minimal (Figure 5D).
We speculated that these additional FIN compounds acted through mechanisms similar to
those induced by erastin or RSL3; we examined whether these FIN compounds inhibited
GPX4 in BJeLR cells. For a side-by-side comparison of GPX4 activity in multiple samples,
we used an LC-MS-based GPX4 assay in which the GPX4 enzyme activity in cell lysates
was measured by their capacity to reduce exogenously added phosphatidylcholine
hydroperoxide (PC-OOH), a GPX4-specific substrate. When GPX4 was inhibited, cells

could not reduce PCOOH, which resulted in a signal for the [PC-OOH + H]+ ion (m/z,
790.6) in the mass chromatogram. BJeLR cells treated with any of the eight FIN compounds
(DPI7, DPI10, DPI12, DPI13, DPI17, DPI18, DPI19, and RSL3) lacked GPX4 activity,
being unable to reduce exogenous PC-OOH (Figure 5E). On the other hand, a control nonFIN compound, staurosporine, and two known FIN compounds, erastin and DPI2, did not
inhibit GPX4 activity in the assay. The LC-MS-based assay requires addition of exogenous
GSH (5 mM) in the reaction mixture; therefore, it cannot detect indirect inhibitory effects on
GPX4 by GSH-depleting agents such as BSO and erastin. We then determined the cellular
GSH level in BJeLR cells treated with DPI2, the one FIN compound that did not inhibit
GPX4 in the LC-MS-based assay, along with BSO and erastin as positive controls, and
staurosporine as a negative control (Figure 5F). DPI2 depleted 90% of cellular GSH
compared to untreated BJeLR cells, indicating that it acts through a mechanism similar to
erastin to induce ferroptotic cell death (Figure 5F).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

These results demonstrate that GPX4-regulated ferroptosis is a common mechanism shared
by multiple independent small molecule scaffolds. All FIN compounds can be categorized
into two classes based on the mode of GPX4 inhibition. One class, including erastin, inhibits
GPX4 through GSH depletion. The second class inhibits GPX4 without GSH depletion,
such as RSL3, which inhibits GPX4 directly (Figure 5G).
Ferroptosis Inducers Inhibit Tumor Growth in a Xenograft Mouse Model
We explored whether the GPX4-regulated ferroptotic cell death pathway could be utilized to
suppress the growth of tumors in a xenograft mouse model. First, we searched for a
pharmacodynamic marker associated with ferroptotic cell death. A set of 83 genes that were
known to be perturbed upon oxidative stress was surveyed to determine whether the
expression level of any gene was affected during ferroptosis induced by erastin or RSL3
(Figure 6A; Table S4). This analysis revealed that PTGS2, a gene encoding
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), was the most upregulated gene in BJeLR cells upon treatment
with either erastin or (1S, 3R)-RSL3 (Figure 6A). The functional relevance of PTGS2 on
ferroptosis was examined using indomethacin, a PTGS-1/PTGS-2 (COX-1/COX-2)
inhibitor. Ferroptotic cell death by erastin or (1S, 3R)-RSL3 was not affected by
indomethacin treatment, suggesting that PTGS2 upregulation is simply a downstream
marker of ferroptosis (Figure S6A).

itself has modest water solubility and is metabolically labile, precluding its use in vivo. We
discovered that introduction of a piperazine moiety into the aniline ring of erastin resulted in
a more water-soluble and more metabolically stable compound that was suitable for in vivo
experiments; we named this compound piperazine erastin (PE). PE upregulated PTGS2 in
BJeLR cells (Figure 6B). Cotreatment of Vit. E suppressed PTGS2 induction by PE, which
indicates that PTGS2 upregulation is downstream of the lipid peroxidation that occurs
during ferroptosis (Figure 6B). (1S, 3R)-RSL3, but not (1R, 3R)-RSL3, increased PTGS2
expression (Figure 6B). In addition, knockdown of GPX4 using siRNAs markedly increased
PTGS2 mRNA abundance, whereas the effect on PTGS2 mRNA abundance of siDeath was
minimal (Figure 6B). Kumagai et al. (2004) reported upregulation of PTGS2 by 4-HNE, an

end product of oxidized lipids in an atherosclerosis model. Moreover, DNA microarray
analysis of gene expression in skin tissue samples obtained from Gpx4-deficient mice
identified Ptgs2 as a key gene upregulated as a consequence of Gpx4 loss (Sengupta et al.,
2013). Taken together, these data confirm that PTGS2 upregulation is a suitable marker for
the lipid peroxidation that occurs during GPX4-regulated ferroptosis.
We tested whether (1S, 3R)-RSL3 could prevent tumor growth in athymic nude mice
implanted with subcutaneous (s.c.) xeno-graft tumors derived from BJeLR cells. Mice were
injected with BJeLR cells s.c. and then with 100 mg/kg (1S, 3R)-RSL3 in the same site 1
day later. The (1S, 3R)-RSL3 injection was repeated twice each week for 2 weeks. Three
weeks later, we observed significant prevention of tumor growth in (1S, 3R)-RSL3-treated
animals (Figure 6C; p = 0.0053). Subsequently, we examined the ability of (1S, 3R)-RSL3 to
shrink preexisting tumors in a therapeutic study, using s.c. xenograft tumors that had been
allowed to grow for 1 week and then treated with 100 mg/kg (1S, 3R)-RSL3 twice a week
for 2 weeks. Again, we observed a significant reduction in tumor volume compared with the
vehicle-treated control group, with this infrequent dosing (Figure 6C; p = 0.038). The
inhibition of tumor growth was likely due to the induction of ferroptosis, as determined by
Ptgs2 upregulation in (1S, 3R)-RSL3-treated tumors (Figure 6C).

We then evaluated the erastin analog PE in a tumor-prevention model using nude mice into
which HT-1080 cells, the human fibrosarcoma cell line, had been injected. As mentioned,
PE has improved metabolic stability (Figure 6D) and water solubility (0.086 mM for erastin
versus 1.4 mM for PE) compared to erastin. PE was affected similarly by cell death
modulators as erastin and displayed a distinct pattern from other non-FIN lethal compounds,
indicating that PE, like erastin, induces ferroptosis in HT-1080 cells (Figure 5C; Spearman
correlation coefficient, 0.9291; p < 0.0001). HT-1080 cells were injected to the flank of
athymic nude mice. One day later, vehicle or PE (40 mg/kg) was s.c. delivered to the nude
mice with a twice-a-week schedule for 1 week. Then, vehicle or PE (30 mg/kg) was
administered to the mice through tail vein once every other day for 6 days. We observed a
significant delay in tumor growth in the PE-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated
group (Figure 6D).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The systemic toxicity and pharmacodynamics of these two ferroptosis inducers, PE and (1S,
3R)-RSL3, were assessed by injecting the compounds through the tail vein at 60 and 10
mg/kg, respectively. At these doses, we observed upregulation of Ptgs2 in mouse liver
(Figure 6E). In contrast, tail vein injection of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin did
not show any induction of Ptgs2 in the same tissue, confirming the specificity of Ptgs2 as a
pharmacodynamic marker (Figure 6E). As a control, we detected robust upregulation of the
p21 gene, a biomarker for p53 activation induced by doxorubicin-mediated DNA damage
(Figure 6E). Regardless of ferroptosis activation in the liver, we observed no overt toxicity
in either animal study, as assessed by the lack of acute lethality, and the lack of significant
body weight reductions. Independently, NCI's DTP (developmental therapeutics program)
evaluated in vivo the toxicity of intraperitoneal injection of (1S, 3R)-RSL3 and observed no
toxicity up to 400 mg/kg dose, which suggested that these doses of (1S, 3R)-RSL3 were well
tolerated (Figure S6).

Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphomas and Renal Cell Carcinomas Are Sensitive to Ferroptosis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We investigated whether the mutation status of RAS genes in cancer cells is a predictor of
sensitivity to erastin-induced ferroptotic cell death, by testing erastin in 117 cancer cell lines
from different tissues such as hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, large intestine, lung,
ovary, and skin (Table S5). The cancer cell line panel contained 38 cancer cell lines with
oncogenic-RAS mutations, which allowed us to examine the correlation between RAS
mutation status and erastin potency.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although erastin displayed synthetic lethality in the engineered cells, it did not show
selective lethality in RAS-mutated cancer cell lines over RAS wild-type counterparts (Figures
S7A and S7B) in this large and diverse panel of cell lines. Although RAS mutations sensitize
to ferroptosis in an individual genetic context, there are other more dominant determinants
of sensitivity when analyzing sensitivity across diverse contexts. Analysis of the 117-cell
line erastin sensitivity data revealed that diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) were
particularly sensitive (Figure 7A). When we divided the 117 cell lines into sensitive and
resistant groups based on AUC values (sensitive if AUC < 3.5, resistant if AUC > 5.5),
DLBCLs were enriched in the sensitive group (Figure 7A, p = 0.01 by chi-square test; p =
0.025 by logistical regression analysis [Basu et al., 2013]). In a larger drug-screening
analysis, it was observed that suspension cell lines were generally more sensitive to growth
inhibitory effects of small molecules (Basu et al., 2013). In order to examine whether the
observed sensitivity enrichment in our analysis was due to the general sensitivity of
suspension cell lines, we tested erastin in seven DLBCL cell lines, five acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) cell lines, and five multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines. The DLBCLs
displayed increased sensitivity among these suspension cell lines, which suggested that
DLBCLs are particularly sensitive to ferroptotic cell death (Figure 7B; see Figure S7C for
individual concentration-dependent curve).
We further analyzed the sensitivity of DLBCLs and other hematopoietic cell lines against
203 diverse lethal compounds to see if DLBCLs are generally sensitive to lethal compounds
(Figure 7C). DLBCL cell lines in fact displayed a slight resistance on average to all
compounds tested compared to other hematopoietic cell lines (p < 3 3 10−4, KolmogorovSmirnov test). This indicates that the enhanced sensitivity of DLBCLs to erastin-induced
ferroptosis is not due to a general sensitivity to all compounds.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We confirmed that erastin and RSL3 generated lipid peroxides in two DLBCL cell lines:
SU-DHL-8 and WSU-DLCL-2 (Figure 7D). Moreover, erastin-induced cell death was
rescued by a lipophilic antioxidant (Vit. E) in these cell lines, indicating that cells were
dying through the lipid ROS characteristic of ferroptosis (Figure 7E).
The potency of erastin was also determined in a 60-cancer cell line panel (NCI60)
(Shoemaker, 2006) from eight diverse tissues, which revealed increased sensitivity of renal
cell carcinomas (RCCs), compared to the other tissues examined (Figures 7F and S7D). We
confirmed the potency of erastin in these RCC cell lines and observed generation of lipid
ROS in two representative RCC cell lines (Figures 7G and 7H). Moreover, erastin-induced
death of these cell lines was suppressed by a lipophilic antioxidant (Vit. E) (Figure 7I). The
two RCC cell lines expressed GPX4, as determined by western blot with a GPX4-specific

antibody (Figure 7J). Knockdown of GPX4 using siRNAs decreased the level of GPX4
protein and was sufficient to kill these RCC cell lines (Figure 7J). Moreover, these cells died
via a characteristic ferroptotic death upon GPX4 knockdown (Figure 7K).

DISCUSSION
Unlike other GPXs, GPX4 can catalyze the reduction of lipid peroxides in a complex
cellular membrane environment (Brigelius-Flohé and Maiorino, 2013). Systemic deletion of
Gpx4 in mice causes embryonic lethality, which was not observed when other Gpx genes
were deleted (Ran et al., 2004), suggesting a unique role for Gpx4 in physiology. Four
groups independently created conditional Gpx4 knockout mice and analyzed the cell death
mechanisms after Gpx4 inhibition (Seiler et al., 2008; Sengupta et al., 2013; Ueta et al.,
2012; Yoo et al., 2012). Lipid peroxidation was observed in all knockout models,
highlighting the importance of Gpx4 for protecting cells from detrimental effects of lipid
peroxides. Systemic deletion of Gpx4 was lethal to mice partly due to the nervous system
damage caused by neuronal loss (Seiler et al., 2008; Yoo et al., 2012).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In models in which Gpx4 deletion caused lethality or cell loss, it is likely that ferroptosis had
occurred. Indeed, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from conditional Gpx4 knockout
mice died with lipid peroxide generation upon Gpx4 deletion. Supplementing Vit. E to these
MEFs in culture rescued cell death (Seiler et al., 2008).
Elevation of lipid peroxidation upon GPX4 inhibition raises the question of the source of
lipid peroxides in normal cellular physiology. Cellular iron may be the most important factor
in lipid peroxide generation during ferroptosis. Indeed, iron chelators suppress ferroptosis
(Yang and Stockwell, 2008a). Some onco-genes, including RAS and MYC, are known to
alter iron metabolism by increasing iron abundance in cells and promoting transformation
(Kakhlon et al., 2002;O'Donnell et al., 2006).
In summary, we have determined that Gpx4 is a central regulator of ferroptosis and that
ferroptosis can be induced in mouse tumor xenografts, providing a possible therapeutic
application of ferroptosis-inducing compounds. See the Extended Discussion for more
information.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Metabolite Profiling
Two million HT-1080 cells were seeded in 10 cm culture dishes. The next day, cells were
treated with 5 μg/ml erastin and incubated for 5 hr before metabolite extraction. A total of 4
ml of cold 80% methanol was added to the cell mono-layer to extract polar metabolites
using a cell scraper. The cell lysate/methanol mixture was transferred to a 15 ml tube and
centrifuged at 2,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min to pellet debris and proteins. The supernatant was
transferred to a new tube and stored at −80°C for LC-MS/MS analysis. For lipid extract
preparation, 3 ml of cold 100% isopropanol was added to the cell monolayer to scrape cells.
The resulting cell lysate/isopropanol mixture was transferred to a new 15 ml tube and

RSL3 Target Identification
A total of 1.5 million cells were seeded into T225 flasks (Corning) 3 days before treatment
in order to be confluent on the day of treatment. Three days later, 20 flasks were washed
with PBS three times to remove serum proteins from the media and then treated with either
0.5 μM (1S, 3R)-RSL3-fluorescein probe (“active probe”) or 0.5 μM (1R, 3R)-RSL3fluorescein probe (“inactive probe”) in serum-free media (DMEM) for 2 hr. For the
competitor-treated samples, 20 flasks of cells were treated with 0.5 μM (1S, 3R)-RSL3
(“competitor”) for 20 min prior to treatment with 0.5 μM active probe for 2 hr. (The active
and inactive probe-treated cells were treated with the equivalent amount of vehicle for the
same time period of the competitor pretreatment.)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

After treatment, the cells were washed once with PBS, trypsinized, and pelleted at 1,000
rpm. Following trypsinization, all the following steps were performed at 4°C. The pelleted
cells were again washed in PBS twice to remove serum proteins added during the
trypsinization. Cells were resuspended in nondenaturing lysis buffer for 20 min (50 mM
HEPES, 40 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 10
mM Na-pyrophosphate, 10 mM Na β-glycerophosphate, and Roche protease inhibitor
tablet).
The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to pellet out insoluble
materials, and the supernatant was removed. Protein concentration was determined using the
Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Subsequent pull-down and proteomics procedures are described
in the Extended Experimental Procedures.
In Vivo Xenograft Mouse Study

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Athymic nude mice (8 weeks; Charles River Laboratories) were injected with four million
HT-1080 cells s.c. The next day, 400 μl of vehicle (0.625% DMSO/99.375% HBSS [pH 2])
or 40 mg/kg PE was delivered to the s.c. site where cancer cells were injected. Two days
later, the s.c. injection was repeated. Three days later, 300 μl of vehicle or 30 mg/kg PE was
administered to the mice through tail vein. Tail vein injection was repeated three more
times, once every other day before the final tumor size was measured in both groups. The
animal protocols containing all the procedures were approved by Columbia University's
IACUC.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed by using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software).

Figure 3. RSL3 Binds to and Inhibits GPX4

(A) RSL3 does not deplete GSH. The level of GSH was determined after treating with 2 μM
RSL3, 10 μM erastin, or 1 mM BSO (n = 3; *p < 0.05). Error bars indicate ± SD.
(B) RSL3 treatment increased lipid ROS level, as erastin did.
(C) The structure of (1S, 3R)-RSL3 is shown.
(D) Only the (1S, 3R) diastereomer displayed selective lethality in HRASV12-expressing
cells in the four BJ-derived cell lines.

(E) Structure of RSL3 affinity probes used in the chemoproteomics experiments is shown.
Fcn, fluorescein affinity tag.
(F) The active affinity probe with the (1S, 3R) stereochemistry exhibited selective lethality
against cells with HRASV12, whereas an affinity probe with the (1R, 3R) stereochemistry
was not lethal.
(G) Affinity-based chemoproteomics identified GPX4 (red dot) as the most likely binding
protein for (1S, 3R)-RSL3. Fold enrichment values of peptides at the indicated condition and
their FDR-adjusted p values were represented as volcano plots. The top three candidates are
shown.
(H) Confirmation of GPX4 binding to active (1S, 3R)-RSL3 affinity probe. Left panel is a
3D visualization of isotopic clusters of peptide ILAFPCNQFGK from GPX4 as rendered by
TransOmics software. Right panel: cell lysates prepared from BJeLR cells treated with
active probe (A), inactive probe (I), or active probe in the presence of competitor (A+C) that
were affinity purified by α-fluorescein antibodies. Then, the purified protein samples were
probed for GPX4 by western blot using GPX4-specific antibody.
(I) (1S, 3R)-RSL3 inhibits enzyme activity of GPX4.

Figure 4. RSL3 Targets GPX4 to Induce Ferroptosis

(A) Knockdown of GPX4 using shRNAs rendered HT-1080 cells hypersensitive to (1S, 3R)RSL3 lethality.
(B) Overexpression of GPX4 rendered HT-1080 cells resistant to (1S, 3R)-RSL3 lethality.
(C) HT-1080 cells transfected with a pool of siRNAs targeting GPX4 showed increased lipid
ROS level as assessed by BODIPY-C11 staining. siNeg has no homology to any known
mammalian genes and was used as a negative control.

(D) Known inhibitors of ferroptosis, 10 μM U0126, 100 μM Vit. E, or 100 μM DFOM, were
able to suppress siGPX4-induced cell death, whereas they could not suppress cell death
induced by siDeath.
(E) Knockdown of GPX4 displayed selective lethality in the four BJ-derived isogenic cell
lines.
(F) Other GPX isoforms are not relevant to ferroptotic cell death.
The values in (D)–(F) were normalized to control samples transfected with siNeg. Bar
graphs in (C)–(F) are mean ± SD (n = 3). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Data in (A)
and (B) are presented as mean ± SD (n = 3). See also Figure S4.

Figure 5. Ferroptosis Occurs through a GPX4-Regulated Pathway

(A) Discovery of additional FINs based on selective lethality in the four BJ cell lines.
(B) FINs (red) are distinct from non-FINs (blue) in accompanying lipid ROS generation
during the cell death process and in death suppression by an antioxidant, BHT.
(C) Modulatory profiling (Wolpaw et al., 2011) with erastin, PE, DPI2, DPI10, and other
lethal molecules confirmed that PE, DPI2, and DPI10 induced a similar form of cell death as
erastin in HT-1080 cells. ΔAUC with a positive sign indicates suppression of cell death,

whereas a negative sign indicates sensitization by cell death modulators upon lethal
compound treatment.
(D) Inhibition of GPX4 by BSO sensitized cells to death induced by 12 FIN compounds,
whereas activation of GPX4 by cDNA overexpression rescued cells from the lethality of
FIN compounds.
(E) Eight structurally diverse FIN compounds inhibited GPX4, whereas two FIN
compounds, DPI2 and erastin, and the negative control staurosporine (STS), a non-FIN
compound, did not show direct GPX4 inhibition in this LC-MS-based assay.
(F) The two FIN compounds, DPI2 and erastin, depleted cellular GSH, which inhibits GPX4
indirectly, whereas staurosporine did not deplete GSH. Bar graph indicates mean ± SD (n =
3).
(G) Model of GPX4-regulated ferroptosis pathway. Ferroptosis inducers can be categorized
into two classes based on the mode of GPX4 inhibition. *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001. See also

Figure 6. Ferroptosis Suppresses Tumor Growth in a Xenograft Mouse Model

(A) Upregulation of PTGS2 expression upon erastin and (1S, 3R)-RSL3 treatments.
(B) PTGS2 expression was induced by PE, (1S, 3R)-RSL3, and siGPX4, but not by PE with
Vit. E, (1R, 3R)-RSL3, and siDeath.
(C) (1S, 3R)-RSL3 inhibited tumor formation and tumor progression through induction of
ferroptosis as demonstrated by upregulation of PTGS2 in the tumors. (1S, 3R)-RSL3 was
administered s.c. twice a week for 2 weeks.

(D) PE showed efficacy in preventing HT-1080 tumor formation in a mouse xenograft
model. The left view shows the structure of PE. The middle view is a mouse liver
microsome assay demonstrating improved metabolic stability of PE over erastin. Midazolam
was used as a positive control for metabolic degradation. The right view shows images
representative of tumors in live mice from each treatment group. PE was delivered s.c. twice
a week for 1 week and then delivered through tail vein injection once every other day for 6
days.
(E) Pharmacodynamics of PE and (1S, 3R)-RSL3 in the mouse liver tissue.
Bar graphs in (B), (C), and (E) represent mean ± SD (n = 3). In (C) and (D), the lines in the
tumor volume plots indicate mean of nine data points. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. See also Figure
S6 and Table S4.

Figure 7. DLBCLs and RCCs Are Sensitive to GPX4-Regulated Ferroptosis

(A) Testing erastin in 117 cancer cell lines revealed DLBCLs as a cancer subtype
susceptible to ferroptosis. DLBCL cell lines are marked with lines on the left. The table
shows the name of DLBCL cell lines along with the sensitivity rank.
(B) DLBCLs were more sensitive to erastin than AML and MM cells.
(C) DLBCL cell lines are no more sensitive to lethal compounds than other hematopoietic
cell lines. The total number of AUCs in the analysis was 3,883 (972 for DLBCL and 2,911
for other hematopoietic cell lines).

(D and E) DLBCL cells died through a mechanism characteristic of ferroptosis, as
determined by lipid peroxide generation and death rescue by Vit. E.
(F) Sensitivity profile of 53 cancer cell lines in the “NCI60” cell panel against erastin. The
cell lines were grouped based on their tissue origins.
(G) The eight RCC cell lines were retested with erastin to confirm their sensitivity against
erastin.
(H) Erastin and RSL3 generated lipid ROS in the two RCC cell lines.
(I) Cell death was rescued by a lipophilic antioxidant, Vit. E.
(J) GPX4 depletion by siGPX4 induced cell death in RCC cell lines. The western blot (right)
confirmed expression of GPX4 protein in these RCC cell lines and knockdown of GPX4 by
siRNAs. Scale bars, 30 μm.
(K) Ferroptosis inhibitors suppressed cell death induced by GPX4 knockdown but could not
suppress cell death induced by the control siRNAs (siDeath) that kill cells via a
nonferroptotic pathway.
Data points in (E), (G), and (I)–(K) represent mean ± SD (n = 3). **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
