ABSTRACT:
Carboxyl terminus of heat shock protein 70-interacting protein (CHIP) is an
E3 ubiquitin ligase that is involved in protein quality control and mediates several
tumor-related proteins in many cancers, but the function of CHIP in pancreatic
cancer is not known. Here we show that CHIP interacts and ubiquitinates epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) for proteasome-mediated degradation in pancreatic
cancer cells, thereby inhibiting the activation of EGFR downstream pathways. CHIP
suppressed cell proliferation, anchor-independent growth, invasion and migration, as
well as enhanced apoptosis induced by erlotinib in vitro and in vivo. The expression
of CHIP was decreased in pancreatic cancer tissues or sera. Low CHIP expression in
tumor tissues was correlated with tumor differentiation and shorter overall survival.
These observations indicate that CHIP serves as a novel tumor suppressor by downregulating EGFR pathway in pancreatic cancer cells, decreased expression of CHIP
was associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

tyrosine kinase activity. The phosphorylation of EGFR
initiates downstream signaling cascade, such as MAPK,
PI3K/Akt and Src pathways, which have been implicated
in carcinogenesis by affecting cell proliferation, survival,
invasion and metastasis[5]. EGFR over-expression is
thought to confer a poor survival, correlating with a
more advanced stage and the presence of metastases in
pancreatic cancer. Therefore, inhibition of the EGFR
signaling pathway is an attractive therapeutic target.
Erlotinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) that selectively inhibits EGFR activation. A phase
III study demonstrated a significant survival benefit
associated with this targeted agent combined with
gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer [6]. However,
previous reports have established that patients rapidly

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause
of cancer-related deaths in the United States [1] with an
incidence rate that is nearly equal to its mortality rate,
which demonstrates the aggressiveness and lethal nature of
this disease. The overall 5-year survival rate is found to be
<6%[2]. Locally advanced tumors with metastatic disease
are often considered to be advanced pancreatic cancer with
poor prognosis. Given the low overall response rates to
traditional chemotherapy, novel therapeutic targets are
urgently needed for this malignant disease.
EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is
conserved and overexpressed in pancreatic cancer[3, 4].
It is a member of the ErbB family of receptors and has

developed resistance, which was most likely caused
by a shorter EGFR intron 1 CA repeat length [7], the
mutation of KRAS[8], and the amplification of c-Met[9]
in pancreatic cancer or other tumors.
CHIP is a U-box dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase that
functions as a chaperone for protein quality control and
as a ubiquitin ligase that degrades its substrates with the
help of proteasome machinery. The structure of CHIP
is composed of a tetratricopeptide repeat domain (TPR)
that links to the chaperones Hsp70/Hsp90, a charged
domain, and a U-box domain that is essential for E3
ubiquitin ligase activity. Increased evidence showed
that CHIP not only modulates misfolded proteins but
also regulates pathophysiological processes. CHIP is
associated with many tumor-related proteins, such as
ErbB2 [10], c-Met[11], SRC-3[12], NF-κB[13], AKT[14],
PTEN[15] and p53[16]. The up-regulation of CHIP could
inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, and its levels were
negatively correlated with the malignancy of human
breast or gastric tumors. However, the exact mechanisms
of CHIP in pancreatic cancer have not been elucidated
to date. In the present study, we identified that EGFR, a
Hsp90 client, is regulated by CHIP through ubiquitination

in pancreatic cancer cells. We also investigated the
functions of CHIP in pancreatic tumor progression and the
significance of CHIP levels in sera or tissues of pancreatic
cancer patients.

RESULTS
CHIP regulates EGFR levels through the UbProteasome pathway in pancreatic cancer cells.
CHIP is a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase that can
degrade many proteins that are related to tumor
progression. We compared the levels of several tumorrelated proteins in control and CHIP knockdown BxPC-3
cells by immunoblotting. We did not observe a correlation
between the expression of SRC-3, ErbB-2, hTERT,
PTEN, FoxO1, Bcl-2, SMAD4, c-myc, Hsp70, Hsp90
and CHIP expression in BxPC-3 cells (Figure 1A), this
result could be explained by feedback of complicated
signaling network in different tumor environments.
Given that EGFR protein is a client of Hsp90 and is

ubiquitination for degradation through
the ubiquitination/proteasome pathway.

(A) The levels of proteins that were degraded by
CHIP in other types of cells were determined by
immunoblotting. (B) CHIP interacts with EGFR
in an endogenous or exogenous way. (i)BxPC-3
cells were pretreated with MG132 (5 μM) for 6
h, and endogenous CHIP-EGFR interaction was
examined by immunoprecipitation with CHIP or
EGFR antibody. (ii)BxPC-3 cells were transfected
with His-EGFR and Flag-CHIP, MG132 were
used after 48 h of transfection, and two exogenous
protein interactions were determined by His or Flag
antibody. (C) CHIP promotes EGFR degradation
in Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells. The levels of EGFR
were determined after cells were infected with
scrambled controls, CHIP amiRNA or CHIP
overexpression(CHIPOE) lentiviruses. (D) CHIP
enhances EGFR degradation in concentration
and ubiquitination/proteasome dependent ways.
BxPC-3 cells were co-transfected with HAubiquitin, His-EGFR and Flag-CHIP plasmids (0,
1 μg, 2 μg per well in a six-well plate). The levels of
His-EGFR were determined by immunoblotting,
using antibody against His-tag. Wells in another
six-well plate were treated with geldanamycin
(GA,1 μM) or MG132 (5 μM) for 6 h after 48 h
co-transfection. The levels of His-EGFR and HAubiquitin were detected with anti-His or anti-HA
antibody. (E) CHIP enhances EGFR degradation
in a time-dependent manner. BxPC-3 cells were
transfected with control,CHIPOE or CHIP amiRNA
for 0, 4, 8, 12, or 24 h. The levels of EGFR were
determined by immunoblotting.

also controlled by the ubiqutination/proteasome system,
we hypothesized that CHIP could be involved in the
modulation of the EGFR protein level in pancreatic cancer.
We first investigated the possibility that CHIP physically
associates with EGFR in an endogenous or exogenous way
after the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot demonstrated that
endogenous EGFR and CHIP interact with each other
in BxPC-3 cells (Figure 1Bi); the His-EGFR and FlagCHIP that were both expressed after plasmid transfection
in BxPC-3 cells can also interact with each other (Figure
1Bii). Then, we examined whether the amount of CHIP
is involved in regulating the stability of EGFR protein.

We tested the levels of EGFR and CHIP in stable CHIP
knockdown (amiRNA) or in up-regulation (CHIPOE) cells,
including Panc-1 and BxPC-3. CHIP knockdown resulted
in an up-regulation of the steady-state levels of EGFR
protein, whereas the levels of EGFR were significantly
lower in CHIPOE cells compared to the control cells
(Figure 1C). In the concentration-dependent experiment,
our results showed that when the expression levels of
exogenous Flag-CHIP increased, the levels of His-EGFR
correspondingly decreased in BxPC-3 cells. This effect
could be significantly accelerated by the Hsp90 inhibitor
geldanamycin (GA). On the other hand, the expression of
His-EGFR did not change much after treated with MG132,

Figure 2: (A) (i)Two main functional domains of CHIP are illustrated schematically. (ii) The U-box domain of CHIP is required for

degradation of EGFR. BxPC-3 cells were co-transfected with HA-ubiquitin, His-EGFR and Flag tagged CHIP-full length (CHIPFL) or its
Flag tagged domains (CHIPΔU-box for CHIP protein without a U-box domain, CHIPΔTPR for CHIP protein without a TPR domain) for 48
h. Then, the cells were treated with or without MG132 (5 μM). EGFR and ubiquitin were detected by immunoblotting with anti-His or
anti-HA antibody. Anti-Flag antibody was used to test the expression of CHIPFL or its domains. (iii) CHIPFL is required to interact with
EGFR. BxPC-3 cells were co-transfected with His-EGFR and Flag-CHIPFL, Flag-CHIPΔU-box or Flag-CHIPΔTPR for 48 h; then, the cells
were treated with MG132 (5 μM). CHIP or its domains were combined by anti-Flag antibody (IP) and immunoprecipitated by A/G agarose
beads. Immunoblotting (IB) using anti-His antibody was performed to determine the exogenous expression of EGFR. (B) The downstream
pathways of EGFR are regulated by CHIP in Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells. The lysate of stable CHIP knockdown cells or CHIPOE cells were
used to determine the expression of AKT/mTOR, Src/FAK/paxillin,MAPK pathways by different antibodies. In the figure, p- represents
phosphorylated, and t- represents total. (C) CHIP down-regulates phosphorylation of Tyr845 and Tyr 1068 of EGFR in Panc-1 and BxPC3 cells. (D) CHIP is co-localized with EGFR in Bxpc-3 cells and attenuates the expression of EGFR. BxPC-3 cells were transfected with
vector or Flag-CHIP plasmid combined with His-EGFR plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were treated with or without EGF (50 ng/mL for 30
min) and then were stained with anti-His or anti-Flag antibody. The white arrows indicate that EGFR was present or absent due to CHIP
under- or over-expression in the cytoplasm or nucleus.

moreover, the levels of EGFR that were associated with
HA-ubiqutin gradually increased (Figure 1D). In the
time-dependent experiment, we demonstrated that the
turnover rate of EGFR increased in CHIPOE BxPC-3
cells and decreased in CHIP knockdown BxPC-3 cells
compared with that in the control cells (Figure 1E). These
results indicate that CHIP can associate with EGFR,
recruit ubiquitin to its target protein, transfer EGFR to
the proteasome and induce its degradation in pancreatic
cancer cells.
To determine which part of CHIP is required for the
binding and down-regulation of EGFR, we created two
plasmids that express the different domains of CHIP: FlagCHIPΔU-box, which expresses the TPR plus charged domain
of CHIP, and Flag-CHIPΔTPR, which expresses the U-box
domain (Figure 2Ai). We found that CHIPFL as well as
CHIPΔTPR could down-regulate the expression levels of
exogenous His-EGFR, while the levels of His-EGFR
did not change after CHIPΔU-box transfection compared
to the control. On the other hand, in BxPC-3 cells that
address MG132, the ubiquitins increased significantly
at the location of approximately 175KDa, which is
the molecular weight of EGFR after the transfection of
CHIPFL or CHIPΔTPR (Figure 2Aii). At the same time, the
co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was performed
to test the binding site of CHIP with EGFR. His-EGFR
is precipitated following the Flag-CHIPFL protein, while
His-EGFR could not been pulled out by either of the
two truncations (Figure 2Aiii). These results raised
the possibility that the full CHIP length rather than its
truncations is needed for combination with EGFR, the
U-box domain of CHIP can add ubiquitin to EGFR and
induce its degradation through the proteasome.
Furthermore, we investigate whether the
downstream signaling pathways of EGFR could
be modulated by CHIP. We found that the levels of
phosphorylated (p-)AKT, mTOR, Bad, Src, FAK, and
paxillin were higher in the stable CHIP knockdown Panc1 and BxPC-3 cells, and the levels of p-AKT, p-mTOR,
p-Bad, p-Src, p-FAK, and p-paxillin significantly
decreased in CHIPOE cells, while the total protein did
not change in the CHIP knockdown and CHIPOE cells.
The CHIP knockdown could also decrease the level of
p21CIP1/WAF1. Thus, CHIP can negatively regulate PI3K/
AKT/mTOR and Src/FAK/paxillin pathway activation in
pancreatic cancer cells. We observed that CHIP can downregulate the level of p-Erk1/2 in Bxpc-3 cells but not in
panc-1 cells, suggesting that CHIP could regulate MAPK
pathway but may be influenced by other factors (Figure
2B). We also tested the levels of different phosphorylated
sites of EGFR in different expression of CHIP, we found
that Tyr 845 and Tyr 1068 of EGFR were regulated by
CHIP expression (Figure 2C).
We next performed immunofluorescence to detect
the effect of Flag-CHIP on His-EGFR. His-EGFR was
predominantly localized to the membrane and cytoplasm
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in BxPC-3 cells while Flag-CHIP was localized to the
cytoplasm and nucleus. The expression of Flag-CHIP
attenuated the His-EGFR levels. After treatment with
EGF that can induce EGFR from membrane to cytoplasm
and nucleus, the co-localization of EGFR and CHIP
was observed in the cytoplasm, and the higher levels
of Flag-CHIP were accompanied by little expression of
EGFR in the nucleus (Figure 2D). These results were
consistent with the EGFR-CHIP interaction detected in
the immunoprecipitation assay.

Tumor growth is inhibited by CHIP in vitro and
in vivo.
To examine the role of CHIP on the growth rate of
pancreatic cancer cells, we performed a cell proliferation
assay. Our results indicated that the CHIP knockdown in
Panc-1 cells increased the ability for growth compared
with negative control cells; in agreement with this
finding, CHIP overexpression suppressed cell growth
compared with the corresponding control. Similar results
were confirmed in BxPC-3 cells (Figure 3A). In the soft
agar colony formation assay, there were fewer colonies
formed in the CHIPOE cells, and the knockdown of CHIP
significantly increased the number of colonies compared
with the control cells (Figure 3B).
To address the anti-tumorigenicity of CHIP on
pancreatic cancer cells in vivo, we used BxPC-3 stable
CHIP knockdown or CHIPOE cells in a nude mouse
xenograft model. Tumor growth was significantly
promoted in nude mice injected with CHIP knockdown
cells compared with control mice (P<.01), while little
tumor growth was observed in the CHIPOE group
compared with the control group (P<.01) (Figure 3C).
To further determine whether CHIP decreases the EGFR
expression and inhibits tumor growth, we performed
immunohistochemistry to detect the expression of CHIP,
EGFR and Ki67 in nude mice tumor tissues. Histological
examination revealed that CHIP is only distributed in
the nucleus of the CHIP knockdown cells. CHIP protein
labeling was noted in a cytoplastic and nuclear distribution
in the control group, and the intensity of CHIP labeling
was stronger in cytoplasm and nucleus in CHIPOE cells.
EGFR protein was shown to be positive in a membranous
distribution. EGFR expression was substantially downregulated in the CHIPOE compared with the control,
whereas CHIP knockdown tumor tissues showed an
up-regulated expression of EGFR in the membranes.
The Ki-67 protein was mainly stained in the nucleus.
The percentage of cells that were strongly labeled with
the Ki-67 antibody was higher in the CHIP knockdown
group compared with the control group (P=.021), while
the percentage of Ki67 strongly positive cells decreased
with an increase in the CHIP expression (P=.026) (Figure
3D). These results suggest that CHIP suppresses tumor
progression by the inhibition of EGFR expression in vivo.

different CHIP expressions. CHIP knockdown led to a
decreased activation of caspase 3/7, while an increased
activation of the caspase 3/7 was observed in CHIPOE cells
after they were exposed to erlotinib (Figure 4B).
To confirm the effect of CHIP on erlotinibinduced tumor growth inhibition and apoptosis in vivo, a
xenotransplantation assay on nude mice was performed.
After 30 days of treatment with erlotinib, the tumor
volume of BxPC-3 xenografts in the CHIP knockdown
group was increased compared with the control tumors
(P=.034). In contrast, the tumor growth ability in mice

injected with CHIPOE cells was significantly abrogated
(P<.01) (Figure 4C). Immunohistochemical analysis of
treated tumor xenografts of BxPC-3 cells were measured
using the cleaved caspase-3 antibody. CHIP knockdown
showed a decrease in the numbers of apoptotic cells,
while cleaved caspases-3 labeling cells increased
sharply in tissues that overexpressed CHIP (Figure 4D).
These observations demonstrate that CHIP can enhance
the ability of erlotinib on tumor growth inhibition and
apoptosis in vitro and in vivo.

in BxPC-3 cells regulate in vivo metastatic activity, we
injected control and CHIP knockdown or CHIPOE cells into
the spleen of nude mice. Liver metastasis was enhanced
in the mice that were given the CHIP knockdown cells
(P<.01). In contrast, CHIPOE in the BxPC-3 cells reduced
the liver metastasis compared to the control cells (P<.01)
(Figure 5B). Our observations show that CHIP attenuates
pancreatic cell invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo.

To examine the roles of CHIP in the invasion and
migration potential of pancreatic cells, we performed a
Transwell assay. The invasiveness of CHIP knockdown
cells was significantly increased compared with the control
Panc-1 cells, whereas CHIPOE decreased the number of
cells that penetrated the ECM-coated membrane. Similar
results were confirmed in BxPC-3 cells. In line with this
finding, the migration abilities of two pancreatic cancer
cells were enhanced after CHIP knockdown, while CHIPOE
reduced the number of cells that penetrated the 8 μm pore
size membrane compared with the control group (Figure

results showed that CHIP protein was localized mainly
in the cytoplasm of pancreatic cancer cells and adjacent
non-cancerous cells (Figure 6A, B). The level of CHIP
expression was decreased in pancreatic cancer tissues
compared with corresponding non-cancerous pancreatic
tissues (P=.038) (Table I). In addition, the expression
of CHIP in pancreatic cancer tissues was significantly
reduced compared to matched normal tissues without
inflammatory cellular infiltration (p<.01) (Table II), while
there was no significant difference between pancreatic
cancer tissues and paired non-cancerous tissues infiltrated
with inflammatory cells (P=0.558) (Table III), which
suggests that inflammation could affect the expression of
CHIP in pancreatic tissues.
In the 202 patients with follow-up, CHIP expression
was negatively correlated with tumor differentiation
(P=.036). However, CHIP expression was not significantly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

correlated with patient age, gender, tumor size, TNM
stage or perineural invasion (Table IV). Kaplan-Meier
analysis revealed that the 1-year overall survival rates
for the patients with low and high CHIP expression were
49.1% and 70.8%, respectively. The median survival
time of the patients with low CHIP expression was 12
months while a high expression of CHIP correlated with
a median survival time of 40 months (Table V). Lower
CHIP staining was significantly correlated with a poorer
overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients (P=.0175)
(Figure 6C). Multivariate Cox regression analysis that
included gender, tumor differentiation, N-stage, M-stage,
perineural invasion and CHIP expression showed
significance in the univariate survival analyses. CHIP
expression was an independent prognostic factor (P=.001).
The high expression of CHIP in histological sections had a
statistically significant hazard ratio of 0.515 (95%CI 0.347

to 0.765) (Table VI).
To explore the expression of CHIP in the serum we
detected CHIP levels in 47 sera samples from patients
who had pancreatic cancer, as well as in age- and sexmatched normal subjects (n=47) and in 18 patients who
had chronic pancreatitis. As a result, the median serum
CHIP level was significantly lower in the patients who
had pancreatic adenocarcinoma compared with healthy
volunteers (P<.001) and chronic pancreatitis patients
(P=.001) (Figure 6D). The median CHIP level was 48.26
pg/ml for patients who had pancreatic adenocarcinoma;
for patients with chronic pancreatitis, the median was
80.27 pg/ml; and for normal controls, the median was
179.99 pg/ml. We also measured the relationship between
CHIP expression in serum and various clinicopathological
parameters in pancreatic cancer patients, The expression
of CHIP had an inverse correlation with distant metastasis
(P=.01) (Table VII), but the serum levels of CHIP were not
correlated with the survival time (P=.602) (Table VIII).
These results indicated that the levels of CHIP were also
decreased in pancreatic cancer sera, and the expression
of CHIP could be a tool to determine whether distant
metastases occur in pancreatic cancer patients.

PI3K/AKT pathway as well as the Src/FAK/paxillin
pathways. The activation of two pathways was reported
to be involved in proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and
migration in pancreatic cancer cells [22, 23]. Furthermore,
MAPK pathway could also be influenced by the expression
of CHIP that were observed in Bxpce-3 cells, but not in
Panc-1 cells that contain mutant K-ras gene,the reason
may be that MAPK signaling pathway were constitutively
activated by mutation of K-ras that exhibited little
response to EGFR regulation in Panc-1 cells[24]. In
addition, we observed that phosphorylation of Tyr845
and Tyr1068 of EGFR was regulated by CHIP, Tyr845
of EGFR could be associated with Src and is involved in
tumor malignancy or resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy
[25, 26]. Phosphorylation site 1068 of EGFR forms a
complex with Grb2 and increases mitogen-activated
protein kinase activation [27]. In accordance with this
finding, we found that CHIP knockdown enhanced the
proliferation, colony formation, invasion and migration of
Panc-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro,
while CHIPOE obtained the opposite results. Moreover,
tumor growth in the mouse xenografts was significantly
enhanced after the injection of CHIP knockdown BxPC-3
cells, whereas the tumor growth rate was inhibited after
CHIPOE cells were injected. The expression of CHIP
also inhibited the number of liver metastases in nude
mice. All of these results indicated that CHIP could act
as a tumor suppressor that prohibits tumorigenesis and
tumor metastasis in pancreatic cancer. The function of
CHIP in pancreatic cancer is consistent with its role in
other malignant cells. Jang KW and colleagues reported
that CHIP destabilizes the Met receptor and inhibits tumor
growth, motility and invasion in lung cancer cells [11].
Kajiro M et al. observed that CHIP suppresses tumor
progression by direct degradation of the oncogene SRC3 in breast cancer cells[12]. Wang S et al. reported that
CHIP can down-regulate the subunit protein of NF-κB and
inhibit gastric tumorigenesis and angiogenesis [13]. On
the other hand, CHIP has been shown to enhance tumor
proliferation by increasing the expression of survivin
protein in human glioma cancer cells [28], which indicates
that CHIP might play different roles in different human
cancers.
In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the EGFR tyrosine
kinase domain is highly conserved, which indicates
that this tumor is responsive to EGFR target therapy.
Elotinib is an oral EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor that
can inhibit the growth and metastasis of human pancreatic
tumor xenografts [29]. Morgan et al. reported that
phosphorylation of Tyr1173 of EGFR is the target of
erlotinib [30],while we observed that phosphorylation
of Tyr845 and Tyr1068 of EGFR could be regulated
by CHIP,thus the multitarget treatment may explain
the phenomena that CHIP enhanced the efficacy of
erlotinib on pancreatic tumor growth and apoptosis. More
importantly, CHIP could also increase the apoptotic rate

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive
tumors with an extremely poor prognosis. Overexpression
of EGFR and its persistent activation has been reported to
contribute to tumor aggressiveness and chemoresistance in
pancreatic cancer[17]. The degradation of EGFR protein
relies on c-Cbl protein, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase
that recruits ubiquitin to its substrate for degradation [18].
Until now, whether there are other ubiquitin ligases that
can induce EGFR degradation remains elusive. CHIP is
an E3 ubiquitin ligase that serves as a bridge to transfer
the protein from the chaperone Hsp90 to the ubiquitinproteasome system [19]. Previous data suggested that
CHIP could induce ErbB2 ubiquitination and degradation
in breast cancer cells [10]. EGFR, which shares close
structural homology with ErbB2, has been shown to
be a client of Hsp90 and has maintained stability in
many cancer cells[20]. Thus, CHIP could theoretically
function as a new ubiquitin ligase that can target EGFR
for degradation. Our results confirmed that CHIP could
interact with EGFR in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition,
CHIP also recruited ubiquitin to EGFR and transferred
its target to the proteasome for degradation. Furthermore,
CHIP accelerated the degradation of EGFR when the cells
were treated with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. This
result is similar to the function of CHIP on ErbB2. Xu W
et al. reported that both the CHIP and GA decrease the
amount of ErbB2 associated with Hsp90, and the CHIP
expression shortens the half-life of the ErbB2 protein[21].
Our study showed that CHIP induced the
degradation of EGFR and inactivated its downstream

MATERIAL AND METHODS

induced by erlotinib in Panc-1 cells that present K-ras
mutations; mutant K-ras has been viewed as a potential
molecular predictor of responses to EGFR inhibition
[31]. For these reasons, we thought that CHIP might be a
potential treatment target for pancreatic cancer.
In the present study, we observed that pancreatic
cancer tumors exhibited a relatively lower level of CHIP
expression compared with adjacent normal tissues.
The expression of CHIP was correlated with tumor
differentiation. Moreover, statistical analysis indicated that
the reduced expression of CHIP was negatively associated
with survival in pancreatic cancer patients and it was one
of the independent risk factors that affected the prognosis
in pancreatic cancer patients. To be consistent with our
results, CHIP levels have been proven to be negatively
correlated with the malignancy of gastric tumor tissues
[13], whereas studies on other digestive tumors obtained
the opposite results. In a study on esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC), the level of CHIP was higher in
the metastatic lymph nodes compared with the primary
tumors as well as in the normal esophageal epithelia.
The high level of CHIP in metastatic lymph nodes was
an independent prognostic factor in ESCC [32]. Liang
ZL et al. reported that the high expression of CHIP
indicated a significantly worse prognosis in gallbladder
carcinoma patients[33]. All of these results indicate that
the pathogenic mechanisms of CHIP expression in human
gastrointestinal cancer are different and still require further
investigation.
Until now, there were no experiments that measured
the expression of CHIP in cancer patients’ sera. Our tests
suggested that CHIP expression was lower in pancreatic
cancer compared with healthy controls and chronic
pancreatitis. The expression of CHIP was also lower
in chronic pancreatitis, which was coincident with the
immunohistochemical protein staining in the normal
tissues infiltrated with inflammatory cells. This result
indicates that inflammation could affect the expression of
CHIP in pancreatic tissue and serum.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that CHIP
serves as a novel EGFR-mediated E3 ligase and attenuates
the downstream EGFR signaling pathways in pancreatic
cancer cells. Also, CHIP acts as a tumor suppressor by
inhibiting cell proliferation, anchorage-independent
growth, invasion and migration, as well as enhancing
cell apoptosis induced by erlotinib in vitro and in vivo.
We also showed that there is lower expression of CHIP
in pancreatic cancer tissues and sera; the negative
relationship between CHIP expression and tumor
malignancy indicates that CHIP may serve as a potential
treatment target of pancreatic cancer.

Plasmids or Lentiviruses for Transfection or
Infection
CHIP artificial miRNA (amiRNA) duplexes were
selected for CHIP silencing; the sequences that were
synthesized are the following: 5’-TGCTGAGAAGTGC
GCCTTCACAGACTGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACAG
TCTGTGGGCGCACTTCT-3’(sense), 5’-CCTGAGAA

amplification and were then subcloned into the pcDNA3.1
expression vector (Invitrogen). Vector encoding of HAtagged Ubiquitin, Flag-tagged CHIP full length(CHIPFL),
Flag-tagged CHIPΔTPR, Flag-tagged CHIPΔU-box, and
His-tagged EGFR were constructed and inserted into
pReceiver plasmids (GeneCopoeia, Guangzhou, China).
For transient transfection, the pancreatic cancer cells
were prepared to 70-80% confluence in 6-well plates and
were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Two days after transfection, cancer cells were used for
subsequent experiments.
The recombinant lentiviruses were packaged
using the pLenti6.2 miR RNAi expression system for
knockdown or the pLent6.31expression system for
overexpression (Invitrogen). Briefly, recombinant was
produced by co-transfecting 293T cells with the lentivirus
amiRNA plasmid (pLenti6.2-miRNA) or overexpression
plasmid (pLenti6.31-CHIP) and packaging plasmids
(pLP1, pLP2 and pLP/VSVG, Invitrogen) using
lipofectamine2000 transfection reagent. Panc-1 and
BxPC-3 cells were infected with the lentivirus, which
produced amiRNA directed against CHIP or the lentivirus
overexpressing CHIP(CHIPOE) or lentivirus with negative
control sequences (Control). The transduction efficiency
was between 70% and 95%. The cells were stably screened
with Blasticidin (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 10 μg/
ml for Panc-1 and 9 μg/ml for BxPC-3.

the membranes were incubated in peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies against mouse or rabbit for 1 h at
room temperature. They were washed and detected using
the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system
(Millipore, USA).

Immunofluorescence Assay
BxPC-3 in the slide chambers (NUNC, Denmark)
were transfected with Flag-CHIP vector and His-EGFR
vector for 24 h. The cells in one chamber were treated with
EGF (100 ng/ml, Invitrogen) for 1 h after transfection. The
cells were fixed in methanol, blocked with 10% FBS and
then incubated with mouse anti-His antibody and rabbit
anti-Flag antibody. The anti-His staining was detected
with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and Flag
with Rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody. Nuclei
were stained with DAPI. The slides were imaged with a
UltraVIEW VoX-3D system (Perkin-Elmer, Massachusetts
, USA). The images were merged using Volocity Demo
software.

Cell Proliferation Analysis
The cell proliferation assay was evaluated using
the CCK-8 kit (Dojindo, Japan). In brief, after the CHIP
knockdown or overexpression in pancreatic cancer cells
was confirmed by RT-PCR and western blot, cells were
seeded in flat-bottomed 96-well plates at 1000 cells per
well. A CCK-8 assay was performed at the time point from
day 1 to 6. After 2 hours of incubation with cell culture
medium that contained CCK-8 reagent, the absorbance
values at 450 nm were detected using an absorbance
microplate reader (SepctraMax 190, Molecular Devices),
and a wavelength of 630 nm was used as a reference.

For immunoprecipitation, cells were seeded in
6-well plates and incubated with 50 μM MG132 for 6 h, to
inhibit the activity of the proteasomes. The cells were then
lysed in modified RIPA buffer. Cell lysates were incubated
with antibody for 12 h at 4 °C on a rotating plate. The
proteins were immunoprecipitated by protein A/G agarose
beads (Santa Cruz, USA). Samples were resolved by SDSPAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis.
Pancreatic cancer cells were grown to nearconfluency in 6-well culture plates. The cells were washed
twice with FBS in each well and ruptured by sonication
using 200 μL of RIPA lysis buffer (Millipore, USA),
which contained a protease and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell lysates were centrifuged
at 12000 r.p.m. for 12 min. Supernatants were measured
with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, USA) and stored
at -80 °C. The protein samples (80 μg) were separated on
6-8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The PVDF
membranes were blocked for 1 h with 0.5% Tween 20
in TBS (TBST), which contained 5% non-fat dry milk,
and they were incubated with antibodies for binding to
the proteins at 4 °C overnight. After washes with TBST,

Colony Formation Assay
Soft agar assays were measured as follows: 1 mL
base layers consisting of 0.6% agar medium was prepared
in 6-well plates. Cells infected with negative control,
CHIP artificial miRNA(amiRNA) for RNAi, or CHIP
overexpression(CHIPOE) lentiviruses were suspended
in 0.3% agar medium supplemented with 20% FBS
and 1×DMEM. The cells were placed 5000 per well for
Panc-1 and 7000 per well for BxPC-3. After 21 days of
incubation, the colonies were stained with crystal violet
solution, and the number of colonies was counted under
the microscope.

Apoptosis Assay
Cell apoptotic assay was performed using the

using a luminescence method that quantifies caspase-3/7
activity, which was determined using the Caspase-Glo
3/7 assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

laparotomy for experiments. After 6 weeks, the mice were
sacrificed by decapitation under adequate anesthesia, and
the number of metastatic foci on the liver surface was
counted. The small nodes were determined by microscopic
analysis after fixation of liver and HE stain.

Tissue and Serum Samples

Migration and Invasion Assay

A total of 225 consecutive patients with pancreatic
cancer between January 2004 and December 2011 in
Peking Union Medical College Hospital were included in
this study. All of the patients related to this study provided
informed consent with the approval of the Committee
and Research Ethics Board of the Peking Union
Medical College Hospital. The diagnosis of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma was based on histological confirmation
from operative specimens. Exclusion criteria included
patients with other organic diseases and the inability to
provide informed consent.
A total of 47 serum samples were obtained
from patients at the time of diagnosis of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma. Sera were also obtained from 18
patients with chronic pancreatitis with a confirmed
clinical diagnosis and from 47 control healthy individuals
collected at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The
sera from the normal subject group were age- and sexmatched to the tumor group. The samples were processed
using the same procedures, and 20 ml of blood was placed
in the serum separator tubes. Samples were collected and
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The serum was
transferred to a 1.5 mL tube and then stored at -80°C. All
of the serum samples were labeled with a unique marker
to protect the confidentiality of the patient .None of the
samples were thawed more than twice before the analysis.

Migration and invasion were performed in a double
chamber assay (8 μm pore size, Corning). The membranes
for the invasion assay were coated with diluted ECM
solution. The cells were added to the upper portion of a
chamber with serum-free media. Medium containing 10%
FBS served as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber.
After incubation for 24 h, the cells from the upper side of
the membrane were scraped and removed by cotton swabs.
The cells on the lower side of the filter were fixed with
methanol and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Cells in 5 visual fields distributed over the membrane were
counted.

In Vivo Xenograft Experiments
A total of 20 female BALB/c nude mice that were
six weeks old were obtained from the Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences (CAMS), Beijing, China and maintained
under pathogen-free conditions. All of the experiments
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
CAMS. The mice were randomly divided into four groups.
Group 1 mice received 5×106 BxPC-3 CHIP knockdown
cells in 200 μL of PBS subcutaneously into the right
flank of each mouse. Group 2 received injections of
negative control cells with the same number and volume
as group 1. Group 3 received inoculations of CHIPOE
(5×106/200μL/mouse), and group 4 received injections of
negative control of CHIPOE with the same concentration
as group 3. Tumors were measured every three days in
two dimensions with calipers. The tumor volumes were
calculated by the equation Volume=1/2×length×(width)2.
Twenty mice were randomly divided into 4 groups
and inoculated with BxPC-3 cells in the above-mentioned
way. The mice were treated orally daily with 50 mg/kg
erlotinib on the basis of individual weights after tumors
were palpable on day 7. Tumor volumes were measured
every three days. These mice were sacrificed, and the
tumors were excised for further research after drug
treatment for 30 days.
A total of 20 nude mice were divided into 4 groups
and anesthetized with 1% chloral hydrate; 5×105/20μL
BxPC-3 CHIP knockdown cells or controls were injected
in the spleen of each nude mouse during open laparotomy,
and 5×105/20μL BxPC-3 CHIPOE cells or controls were
injected in the spleen of each nude mouse during open

Immunochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on
paraffin-embedded sections. The tissues were fixed in
4% formaldehyde overnight and embedded in paraffin
wax. Sections were deparaffined in xylol and rehydrated
using graded ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed
using a high pressure method for 3 min with citrate
buffer. Sections were treated with 3% H2O2 for 10
min to eliminated endogenous peroxidase. Quenched
sections were incubated in non-immune serum for 20
min and then added with the appropriate dilution of
each primary antibody (a 1:200 dilution of anti-EGFR
antibody, a 1:200 dilution of anti-CHIP antibody, a 1:300
dilution of anti-Ki67 antibody or a 1:100 dilution of antileaved caspase-3 antibody) overnight at 4°C, followed
by incubation with linked reagent for 30 min. For the
negative control, the immunostaining processes were
performed by using PBS as a substitute for the primary
antibody. The antigen-antibody complex was detected

by using diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. All of the
sections were then counterstained with haematoxylin,
dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols and xylol, and
mounted. Slides were reviewed by light microscopy. CHIP
expression in tissues was evaluated in a blinded fashion by
an experienced pancreatic pathologist. Visual fields (×400
magnifications) were chosen to calculate the percentage
of positively stained cells over the total number of tumor
cells.
The staining proportion of the positive cells was
divided into four groups: negative, 0 positive cells found;
+, <30% of tumor cells observed; ++, 30%-60% of tumor
cells were immunopositive; and +++, >60% of tumor cells
observed. Cases with proportion scores of – and + were
included in the CHIP low expression group, while those
with proportion scores of 2+ and 3+ were included in the
CHIP high expression group for all of the analysis.

cancer: a phase III trial of the National Cancer Institute
of Canada Clinical Trials Group. J Clin Oncol. 2007;
25(15):1960-1966.

An ELISA assay was performed with a human
CHIP ELISA kit (CUSABIO Inc, Wuhan, China). In brief,
antibody specific for human CHIP protein has been precoated onto a microplate. Standards and samples were
pipetted into the wells, and any CHIP proteins were bound
by the immobilized antibody. After removing any unbound
substances, a biotin-conjugated antibody specific for CHIP
is added to the wells. After washing, avidin conjugated
Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) was added to the wells.
Following a wash to remove any unbound avidin-enzyme
reagent, a substrate solution was added to the wells, and
color develops in proportion to the amount of CHIP bound
in the initial step. The color development was stopped, and
the intensity of the color was measured. The measurement
of each sample was tested twice. The value of 58.68 pg/
ml that could differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic
pancreatitis by Yoden index was determined as a cutoff
point to measure the higher or lower expression of CHIP
in serum.

The values were presented as the mean ± SD. The
two-tailed Student’s t-test was used for comparing the
mean values between two groups. χ2 or Fisher’s exact test
was used to compare categorical characteristics across
groups. Univariate models and multivariable logistic
regression was used to assess the significance of CHIP
in the prognosis or prediction of pancreatic cancer. The
survival rates were calculated by the method of KaplanMeier. A value of P<0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant. SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc, USA) was used for
statistical analysis.
