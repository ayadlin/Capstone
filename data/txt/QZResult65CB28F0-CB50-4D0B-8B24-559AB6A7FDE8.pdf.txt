BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance is a common clinical complaint of oncology patients and contributes to substantial morbidity.
However, because most sleep studies have been cross-sectional, associations between sleep quality and distress in patients with
ovarian cancer over time remain unclear. This prospective longitudinal study examined rates of sleep disturbance; contributions of
depression, anxiety, and medication use in sleep disturbance; and associations between sleep quality and quality of life (QOL) during
the first year after diagnosis among women with ovarian cancer. METHODS: Women with a pelvic mass completed measures of sleep
quality, depression, anxiety, and QOL before surgery. Those diagnosed with primary epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal
cancer repeated surveys at 6 months and 1 year after diagnosis. Mixed modeling was used to examine trajectories of psychosocial
measures over time, as well as associations between changes in distress and sleep quality. Relationships between changes in sleep
and QOL were also examined. RESULTS: The majority of patients reported disturbed global sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index > 5)
at all 3 time points. Medications for sleep and pain were associated with worse sleep at all time points. Greater increases in depression were associated with increased disturbances in sleep quality over time (P <.04). Worsening sleep was also associated with
declines in QOL over time (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep disturbance is common and persistent in women with ovarian cancer, and
is linked to depressive symptoms and QOL. Pharmacologic treatment does not appear to adequately address this problem. Results

INTRODUCTION
Sleep disturbance is common and contributes to substantial morbidity among patients with cancer.1-4 Rates of sleep disturbance in patients with cancer are higher than in the general population1 and have been documented by polysomnography.2 Among patients with heterogeneous advanced cancers, 72% reported sleep disturbance, with common complaints
including difficulties with sleep onset and maintenance, not feeling rested in the morning, and daytime fatigue.3 Chemotherapy has been associated with significantly poorer sleep quality4 and daytime sleepiness.5 Disturbed sleep has functional
consequences as it has been associated with poorer quality of life (QOL) in women with breast cancer, including impaired
ability to perform work and daily tasks,6 although not all studies have yielded consistent results.7 A recent study of patients
with ovarian cancer within 5 years of diagnosis reported that sleep disturbance contributes to poorer QOL regardless of
disease stage and chemotherapy status.8
Sleep disturbance often persists over extensive time periods in patients with cancer. Disturbed sleep and fatigue have
been reported in women with breast cancer even before initiation of treatment.9 Generally, sleep disturbance in patients
with breast or prostate cancer declines over the 6 months following treatment.10 However, at least one study has found

that 23.3% of women treated for early-stage breast cancer
still have symptoms of insomnia for up to 2 to 5 years after
treatment completion.11
Because of poor prognosis and rigorous treatment
protocols,12 patients with ovarian cancer often suffer
high distress at the time of diagnosis and during treatment,13 potentially placing them at elevated risk for sleep
disturbance. However, little is known about the trajectory of sleep disturbance following diagnosis and what
factors confer increased risk for poor sleep in ovarian
cancer patients over time. To address these issues, the
first objective of this study was to characterize prevalence
of self-reported sleep disturbance in women with ovarian
cancer prior to surgery, and at 6 months and 1 year after
diagnosis. The second objective was to examine risk factors for poor sleep trajectories, including depression, anxiety, and menopausal status at the time of surgery, and to
examine the extent to which antidepressants, pain, and
sleep medications alleviate sleep disturbance over time.
Because ovarian cancer surgery initiates menopause in
premenopausal patients, we hypothesized that sleep disturbance would be worse in premenopausal patients.14
To date, no studies have followed patients with ovarian
cancer prospectively to assess how depression, anxiety,
and quality of life are related to sleep disturbance over
time. Depression is common among individuals with
cancer15 and has been associated with decreased sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and nocturnal awakening
among patients with breast cancer.16 Anxiety is also commonly experienced by patients with ovarian cancer17,18
and has been cross-sectionally associated with insomnia
in this population.19 Thus, we hypothesized that worsening depression and anxiety over time would contribute to
poorer sleep over time, and that poorer sleep trajectories
would contribute to poorer QOL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants

Following institutional review board approval, women
older than 18 years with a pelvic mass suspicious for ovarian cancer were recruited presurgically as part of a larger
prospective study examining psychosocial factors and cancer progression. Exclusion criteria included corticosteroid
use in the previous month, history of previous cancer, current pregnancy, inability to accurately answer questions,
comorbid condition with known effects on immune function, and nonovarian primary site. Inclusion was confirmed following surgical diagnosis of epithelial ovarian,
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. The final

sample is described in Figure 1. At the presurgical stage,
173 women had histological confirmation of diagnosis
with epithelial ovarian cancer and had complete data on
relevant measures; at 6 months after diagnosis, 119 of
these patients were available for assessment; at 1 year, 108
were available for assessment. Women completed psychosocial questionnaires prior to surgery and again at followup visits.
Measures
Sleep Quality

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a 19-item
self-report measure assessing types and frequency of sleep
disturbances experienced over the last month.20 Seven
subscale scores are summed to yield a global score; global
scores > 5 indicate poor sleep,20 and scores > 10 are considered to indicate clinically impaired sleep (M. Hall,
written communication, 2011). The scale has a diagnostic
sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5%.21 The scale
3235

Original Article

is psychometrically sound in patients with cancer22 and
correlates with sleep log data in primary insomnia.23
Depressive Symptoms

The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D) is a 20-item self-report measure rating mood
during the previous week. Higher scores indicate greater
depressive symptomatology, with scores  16 consistent
with clinical depression.24 The CES-D is considered a
valid and reliable assessment for depressive symptoms in
cancer patients.25,26
Anxiety

The Profile of Mood States short-form (POMS-SF) is a
37-item inventory assessing 6 dimensions of mood27 often used in research with patients who have cancer.28,29
This study used the anxiety subscale as the indicator of
anxiety.
Quality of Life

The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (for ovarian patients) (FACT-O) assesses QOL in individuals with
cancer. The FACT provides a total QOL score as well as
subscales for physical, functional, social, spiritual, and
emotional well-being from 51 items.30 Statements are
rated on a scale from 0 (“not at all”) to 4 (“very much”)
and cued to well-being during the previous week.
Performance Status

Participants rated physical functioning in the past 7 days
from 0 (“fully active”) to 3 (“completely disabled”) using
the Gynecologic Oncology Group Performance Status measure.31 This was used as a covariate in regression analyses.
Demographic and Clinical Information

Self-reported information on age, education, race, ethnicity, and marital status was collected prior to surgery. Clinical information including tumor stage and grade,
menopausal status, and use of medications was extracted
from medical records.
Statistical Analysis

Analyses were conducted using SPSS (Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences), version 19.0 (SPSS, Chicago,
Ill). Data distributions were examined for violations of
normality and outliers. Descriptive statistics were used to
examine the presence of poor sleep at baseline and 1
year. One-way analyses of variance were used to examine
differences in sleep disturbance between users and nonusers of specific medications at each time point as well as
between patients receiving versus not receiving chemo3236

therapy at follow-up. Because sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety were unrelated to chemotherapy status,
this variable was not included in subsequent analyses (all
P values > .13).
Longitudinal analyses used repeated measures mixed
models (SPSS MIXED procedure). All models included
disease stage, presurgical menopausal status, and the use
of pain medications, anxiolytics/antidepressants, and
sleep medications prior to surgery as a priori covariates.
Moreover, we tested models with additional potential psychosocial, medical, and demographic covariates to determine if they exerted a significant influence on model
estimations. Covariates exerting a significant influence on
model estimations were retained in final models. Models
examining the change in sleep quality as a function of
change in depression and anxiety included change in selfreported disability as a covariate. Changes in depression
and anxiety were both included in models examining the
effects of distress on sleep quality to disaggregate the
effects of depression versus anxiety on changes in sleep.
Covariance structure was evaluated with Wald z-tests
of rho covariance parameters and comparison of Schwarz’s
Bayesian criterion (BIC) between models with different
covariance structures, as suggested by existing literature.32,33 First-order autoregressive covariance structures
were supported for all models by significance of rho covariance parameters (all P values < .001) and lower BIC compared to diagonal and unstructured covariance structures.
Pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means, using
a Sidak adjustment, were conducted to examine changes
from baseline to 6 months and from 6 months to 1 year.
Covariates

Income; race; ethnicity; relationship status; body mass
index; histopathology; presence/absence of residual tumor; use of caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine; presence/absence of chemotherapy at 6 months and 1 year; and
presence of comorbid conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, sleep apnea, heart disease, or hypertension were nonsignificant covariates in all
models (all P values > .112). Disease stage was not a significant predictor of change in QOL, global sleep score,
depression, or anxiety (all P values > .32). Significant
interactions of covariates with outcomes in longitudinal
models will be addressed in the Results section.

Participant Characteristics

Participants were primarily non-Hispanic Caucasians
with a mean age of 56 years. The majority of participants

had advanced stage and high-grade disease. The association between sleep disturbance and presence of ascites at
the time of surgery was nonsignificant (r 5 .13, P 5 .09)
(Table 1).
Medication Use and Sleep Quality

Medication use was largely similar before surgery and at 6
months and 1 year after diagnosis (Table 1). At all time
points, patients using prescribed sleep or analgesic medications reported significantly worse sleep quality than
those not using these medications (all P values > .025).
There were generally no differences in global sleep quality
for users and nonusers of antidepressant and anxiolytic
medications (all P values > .10), although at 6 months,
patients taking antidepressants had significantly worse
sleep quality than nonusers (P 5 .03).
In addition, specific patterns of medication use were
associated with psychosocial recovery over time. For
example, presurgical use of pain medication was associated with less improvement in sleep quality, depression,
anxiety, and QOL over time (all P values < .038). In contrast, sleep medication and anxiolytics/antidepressants
generally had no associations with changes in these measures over time (all P values > .15).
Menopausal Status

At baseline, mean PSQI scores for premenopausal women
were slightly worse (PSQI 5 8.98, standard deviation 5
3.91) than scores for postmenopausal women (PSQI 5
7.25, standard deviation 5 3.48), but this difference was
nonsignificant. Women who were premenopausal at
study entry had less improvement in sleep quality, depression, and anxiety over time than their postmenopausal
counterparts (all P values < .025). In contrast, menopausal status was not associated with changes in QOL over
time (P 5 .41).
Sleep, Depression, Anxiety and QOL Over Time

Prior to surgery, 70.7% of patients reported disturbed
global sleep (PSQI > 5); of these patients, 24.3% reported
global sleep poor enough to be rated “clinically impaired”
(PSQI  10). During the year following surgery, significant improvements were seen in global sleep quality
(P 5 .035), depression (P < .001), anxiety (P < .001),
and QOL (P < .001). Pairwise comparisons of sleep,
depression, anxiety, and QOL scores revealed significant
improvement from surgery to 6 months (P < .033), but
these factors were relatively stable between 6 months and
1 year (all P values > .88). Examination of the clinical
meaning of these scores revealed that although global sleep

reported improvement to nonclinical levels of depression
over time. Specifically, at the presurgical stage, 45% of
patients reported depression scores above the CES-D clinical depression cutoff ( 16); percentages of patients
above the cutoff improved to 20.7% at 6 months and
20.9% at 1 year after surgery (Table 2).
Associations Between Changes in Distress and
Changes in Sleep Quality

After adjusting for cancer stage, menopause, performance
status, and medications, increased depression from surgery to 1 year was associated with less improvement in
overall sleep quality (P < .001). Changes in anxiety were
not significantly associated with changes in sleep quality
(P 5 .09). However, those patients using pain (P 5 .017)
3238

or sleep medications (P 5 .001) before surgery or who
had been premenopausal before surgery (P 5 .027)
showed less improvement in sleep quality as their depression improved. Improved self-reported performance status was also significantly associated with improved sleep
(P 5 .005).
Change in QOL as a Function of Change in
Sleep

Between surgery and 1 year after diagnosis, improvements
in global sleep quality were associated with improvements
in QOL scores, adjusting for stage, menopausal status,
and medication use (P < .001). Women with earlier stage
disease showed more QOL improvement with improved
sleep than did those with advanced stage disease
(P 5 .03).
DISCUSSION
The present data demonstrate that a high proportion of
women with ovarian cancer reported sleep disturbance
before surgery, and these disruptions in sleep tended to
persist over the first year after diagnosis, independent of
whether patients were receiving chemotherapy. The proportion of patients with ovarian cancer reporting sleep
disturbances at each of the measured time points was similar to rates in other oncology populations.8,9 At all time

points, patients using either sleep or pain medication
reported worse global sleep than those not taking these
medications; in contrast, antidepressant and anxiolytic
medication use was generally unrelated to sleep quality.
Longitudinal improvements in depression were associated
with improvements in global sleep, although improvements over time in anxiety were not independently associated with better sleep. Despite statistically significant
improvement in global sleep between the presurgical stage
and 6 months after diagnosis, mean sleep quality
remained in the disturbed range over the course of the
study. Furthermore, as predicted, sleep disturbance was a
risk factor for diminished QOL over time, whereas
improvements in sleep improved QOL.
The current study is the first to longitudinally assess
sleep disturbance in ovarian cancer survivors and to demonstrate that sleep disturbance is common and persistent
during the first year after diagnosis. These data thus
extend previous cross-sectional descriptions of sleep problems in ovarian cancer.18,19 These data highlight risk factors associated with disturbed sleep trajectories and reveal
that sustained sleep disruptions have a significant impact
on patients’ overall QOL. Risk factors for sustained sleep
disturbance include depression, performance status, use of
pain medication, and premenopausal status. The associations between depressive mood and sleep disturbance are
consistent with findings in patients with metastatic breast
cancer, where depressive symptoms predict worsening of
sleep over time.16
Potential Mechanisms

Several mechanisms may underlie disrupted sleep in cancer patients. Dysfunctions in the gamma-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) system as well as in serotonin receptors have
been associated with sleep disturbance and depression.34,35 Depression has been related to heterogeneous
difficulties including sleep maintenance and early morning awakening.36 Because difficulties with sleep onset and
maintenance both contribute to the global sleep disturbance score, it is possible that multiple mechanisms are
operating here. Depression may also contribute to worse
sleep; thus, a bidirectional mechanism may underlie the
current findings.
Tumor-related processes may also contribute to
both depressive symptoms and discomfort, thereby causing impaired sleep. For example, before surgery, abdominal bloating and ascites may contribute to discomfort37
with concomitant sleep impairment. This may be
reflected in the association of poor performance status
with impaired sleep; however, presence of ascites per se
Cancer

was not associated with sleep disturbance. In addition,
tumor-derived inflammatory cytokines may play a role in
both sleep and depression. For example, we and others
have previously reported elevations in the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6)38,39 and links between
poorer sleep quality and elevated IL-6 in patients with
ovarian cancer.40 High levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 have in turn been associated
with central vegetative symptoms including fatigue, malaise, and sleep alterations, as well as depressive symptoms.41 Thus, it is possible that tumor-derived
inflammation may contribute to both depressive symptoms and sleep disturbance. Alternatively, sleep and cytokines may have a bidirectional relationship whereby
alterations in sleep influence cytokine expression, and
cytokines in turn have a regulatory influence on sleep.42
Bidirectional relationships may exist between
chronic pain and sleep disturbance.43 Specifically, chronic
pain is thought to contribute to poorer sleep, which in
turn may increase pain sensitivity. Although untreated
pain may contribute to discomfort and inability to initiate
and maintain sleep, analgesic medications may produce
daytime side effects that also interfere with nighttime
sleep.44 Although there was not a direct measure of pain
in the current study, the present findings support an association between pain medications and poorer sleep.
Women who were premenopausal prior to surgery
reported worse sleep trajectories over time. Surgical
oophorectomy induces an immediate menopause and
thus may initiate the onset of classic menopausal symptoms such as nocturnal temperature fluctuations and hot
flashes, both of which interfere with sleep.14 In addition,
facing a life-threatening diagnosis at a younger age and/or
loss of childbearing status may give rise to sleep
disturbances.
Limitations

The absence of data on premorbid sleep patterns limits
our ability to determine how the sleep patterns reported
here may relate to long-term disturbance. We also do not
have data regarding contextual issues, such as insomnia
arising from sleeping with a partner who snores. In addition, study data rely on self-report measures, which are
subject to reporting biases and retrospective recall.
Although polysomnography and actigraphy provide
objective assessments of sleep disturbances, these technologies were deemed too intrusive for this patient population, particularly when facing surgery for a lifethreatening disease. Because study design was correlational, definitive causal relationships cannot be
3239

Original Article

determined, and it is possible that sleep disturbance may
lead to depression as well.45 Because of the minimal numbers of women taking hormone replacement therapy in
this sample, influences of hormone replacement on sleep
could not be examined. In addition, potential third variables such as inflammation, cortisol dysregulation, and
stressful life events could also be contributing to poor
sleep, affective disorders, and poor QOL.
Clinical Implications

The extent of initial and sustained sleep disturbance in
this population, and its impact on QOL, highlights the
clinical relevance of this problem in ovarian cancer
patients. These findings suggest the importance of screening for possible sleep disturbance, both at time of diagnosis, as well as during treatment and follow-up. The extent
of sleep disturbance, combined with findings that hypnotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and pain medications
do not appear to facilitate improved sleep, suggest that
other effective interventions for sleep disturbance may
need to be explored. For example, behavioral interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and
mindfulness-based stress reduction have known effectiveness for insomnia46,47 and have shown positive benefits in
oncology patients.48,49
Conclusions

Women with ovarian cancer report sustained sleep quality
disturbance up to 1 year after diagnosis, and this disturbance is associated with impaired QOL. Furthermore,
depression confers increased risk for poor sleep quality in
this population. These findings highlight the importance
of ongoing screening for sleep disturbance in clinical cancer care. Furthermore, because pharmacological interventions appear to have limited effectiveness in this
population, behavioral interventions to alleviate depression and improve sleep quality may contribute to
improved QOL and decreased morbidity in this
population.
