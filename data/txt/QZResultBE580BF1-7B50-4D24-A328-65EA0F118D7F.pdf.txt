Abstract
Lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic subtype
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), are frequently associated with activating mutations in the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Although these patients often respond clinically to the EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors erlotinib and geﬁtinib, relapse inevitably occurs, suggesting the development of escape mechanisms
that promote cell survival. Using a loss-of-function, whole genome short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen, we
identiﬁed that the canonical Wnt pathway contributes to the maintenance of NSCLC cells during EGFR inhibition,
particularly the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase 1 and 2 that positively regulate canonical Wnt
signaling. Inhibition of tankyrase and various other components of the Wnt pathway with shRNAs or small
molecules signiﬁcantly increased the efﬁcacy of EGFR inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo. Our ﬁndings therefore
reveal a critical role for tankyrase and the canonical Wnt pathway in maintaining lung cancer cells during EGFR
inhibition. Targeting the Wnt-tankyrase-b-catenin pathway together with EGFR inhibition may improve clinical
outcome in patients with NSCLC. Cancer Res; 72(16); 4154–64. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the
United States (1). NSCLC account for 82% of lung cancers (2).
Since most NSCLC are diagnosed at late stages, prognosis is
quite poor. Even when combining newer agents, such as
bevacizumab with traditional chemotherapy, the median overall survival of patients with metastatic NSCLC remains less
than 1 year, and only 3.5% of NSCLC patients survive 5 years
after diagnosis (3, 4).
Adenocarcinomas, the most common histologic type of
NSCLC, are frequently (40–80%) associated with mutations and/or ampliﬁcations in the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) gene (5). For patients with activating mutations in EGFR, the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
erlotinib and geﬁtinib provide better treatment than conventional chemotherapy, with impressive response rates
(>70%) and prolonged progression-free survival (2, 6–8).
However, the duration of responses is short-lived, and all
patients eventually relapse.

The dysregulation of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway has been
observed in various forms of cancer. Approximately 90% of
sporadic colon cancers exhibit aberrant Wnt signaling activity,
usually as a result of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene
mutations, but also because of mutations in genes encoding
b-catenin or Axin (9). Importantly, it has been recently shown
that altered b-catenin expression, or WNT1, WNT3A, and
WNT5A overexpression, are associated with poor prognosis
in NSCLC patients (10). Thus, the Wnt/b-catenin pathway may
play an important role in NSCLC pathogenesis and resistance
to therapy.
Secreted Wnt family proteins bind to speciﬁc Frizzled (Fzd)
receptor complexes on cells and activate intracellular pathways (11, 12). The canonical Wnt pathway regulates the activity
of b-catenin and its ability to drive activation of speciﬁc gene
targets. In the absence of a Wnt signal, b-catenin is targeted for
degradation. APC and Axin compose a scaffold that permits
b-catenin phosphorylation by casein kinase 1a (CK1a) and
glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b), resulting in b-catenin
ubiquitinylation and proteosomal degradation. Conversely,
upon binding of a Wnt ligand to the Fzd receptor, Axin is
shuttled to the cell membrane, preventing b-catenin degradation. Accumulating b-catenin can then enter the nucleus and
on interaction with members of the Tcf/Lef transcriptional
activators, facilitates the expression of various gene targets.
Interestingly, the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrases 1
and 2, which play various roles in the cell including in telomere
maintenance (13), have recently been shown to positively
regulate canonical Wnt signaling (14).
Although targeted therapies, such as using EGFR TKI, have
shown clinical promise, these therapies do not produce

durable remissions for NSCLC. Although in some cases secondary mutations in the kinase may prevent inhibitor binding,
additional escape mechanisms are mostly poorly deﬁned. As
lung cancers are typically diagnosed at advanced phases and
seems to possess inherent or acquired survival mechanisms
that can protect cells from EGFR inhibition, the discovery of
pathways that mediate compensatory survival mechanisms
could reveal novel therapeutic targets that render pharmacological EGFR inhibitors more effective for the treatment of lung
cancer. For this reason, we carried out a genome-wide short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen to identify gene products whose
inhibition synergizes with the EGFR inhibitor geﬁtinib to
eliminate NSCLC cells. Our screen identiﬁed a number of
druggable gene products within the Wnt/tankyrase/b-catenin
pathway as mediators of NSCLC maintenance during EGFR
inhibition.

Materials and Methods
Genome-wide functional genetic screening
A total of 1  107 cells from each cell line were transduced
with the SBI shRNA library (multiplicity of infection of 0.3)
and 72 hours later subjected to puromycin selection (1 mg/mL)
for 10 days. Cells (1  107) were treated in triplicate with
geﬁtinib at IC70 (0.6 mmol/L for H322C; 0.05 mmol/L for
HCC4006) or vehicle (DMSO) for 48 hours followed by culture
for 96 hours without drugs. Total RNA was isolated from each
group using Trizol (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed (using
vector-speciﬁc primer) with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Epicenter). The cDNA was ampliﬁed by nested PCR, with addition
of Illumina-speciﬁc adapter sequences. After sequencing on an
Illumina GenomeAnalyzer (Illumina), shRNAs were identiﬁed
and the number of clusters for each shRNA sequence quantiﬁed.

provided HCC4006 cells in 2006. H322C were obtained from
Dr. Al Moustada (Biotechnology Research Institute, Montreal,
Quebec, Canada) in 2003. H3255 and H3122 were obtained
from Dr. Bruce Johnson and Dr. Pasi Janne (Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) in 2004 and 2008, respectively.
Calu-3, HCC4006, H322C, H3255, and H3122 were last authenticated by STR DNA proﬁling in February 2012 by our Molecular Biology Core. The STR proﬁles for these lines matched the
proﬁles on ﬁle at the ATCC (Calu-3) and proﬁling data provided by Drs. Minna and Gazdar (HCC4006, H322C, H3255, and
H3122).
Nude mouse xenograft tumor model
Athymic nude mice (4- to -6-week-old females) were
obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Cultured cells
(2  106) were injected into the ﬂanks of mice at day 0. Vehicle
or geﬁtinib was injected i.p. daily (5/7 days). Tumor volumes
were evaluated by caliper measurement and calculated by the
formula: p  (short diameter)2  (long diameter)/6. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Ki67 staining were carried out
using standard protocols.
Graphing and statistical analyses
Graphing and statistical analysis were carried out using
PRISM-5 software. Unless otherwise indicated, 2-tailed Student
t test was used.
See Supplementary Methods for descriptions of methods
for lentivirus preparation, cell culture, colony forming assays,
cell viability/cell cycle/apoptosis/senescence assays, Western
blotting, RT-PCR, and chemicals used.

Results
Bioinformatics analysis
We developed Bioinformatics for Next Generation
Sequencing! (BiNGS!) for analyzing and interpreting synthetic
lethal screen data (15). A preprocessing step ﬁltered out
erroneous and low-quality reads. Filtered reads were mapped
against the shRNA reference library using Bowtie (16). Output
from this step is a P  N matrix, where P and N represent
shRNA counts and samples, respectively. A secondary ﬁltering
step removes shRNA reads mapping to sequences without gene
annotations. We also ﬁltered out shRNAs where the median
raw count in the control group is greater than the maximum
raw count in the treatment group if the shRNA is enriched in
the control group, and vice versa. We then employed negative
binomial to model the count distribution in the sequencing
data using edgeR (17). We computed the q-value of false
discovery rate for multiple comparisons for these shRNAs, and
carried out meta-analysis by combining adjusted P-values for
all shRNAs representing the same gene using weighted Ztransformation (18). We used the associated P-value, P(wZ),
to sort lists of genes with differentially represented shRNAs.
Cell lines

Collection (ATCC) in 2002. Drs. John Minna and Adi Gazdar

To identify gene targets whose inhibition cooperates with
geﬁtinib to more effectively eliminate NSCLC cells, we
designed a genome-wide RNAi-based loss-of-function screen
(Fig. 1A). We generated EGFR TKI-sensitive NSCLC cell lines
H322C and HCC4006 expressing lentiviral-encoded shRNAs
targeting all known human genes, with most cells expressing
a single shRNA. H322C, a bronchioalveolar carcinoma with
wild-type EGFR, exhibits intermediate sensitivity to geﬁnitib
(IC50 0.25 mmol/L). HCC4006, an adenocarcinoma that possesses an ampliﬁed EGFR gene with exon 19 deletion (an
activating mutation), exhibits high sensitivity to geﬁtinib (IC50
0.02 mmol/L; ref. 19).
Each cell line was divided into 6 populations: 3 were treated
with DMSO and 3 were treated with geﬁtinib for 48 hours at
doses that inhibit expansion by 70%, followed by 96 hours of
culture without drug. shRNA sequences were ampliﬁed,
sequenced, identiﬁed, and statistically analyzed as described
in Materials and Methods. Over 5 million shRNAs were read per
sample, representing more than 60,000 unique shRNAs. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of mapped shRNA sequences
from the individual samples revealed that DMSO samples
clustered together and geﬁtinib-treated samples clustered
together (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, geﬁtinib
treatment is reproducibly affecting the representation of

shRNAs; therefore, this screen should reveal shRNA targeted
gene products whose knockdown either increases or decreases
geﬁtinib-mediated inhibition of NSCLC cells.
For synthetic lethality, we considered genes targeted by
shRNAs that were depleted in the treatment group with Pvalues, P(wZ), of <0.05 as synthetic lethal hits (1237 and 748
genes each for H322C and HCC4006; Supplementary Table S1).
Importantly, we identiﬁed 104 genes with signiﬁcant underrepresentation in both NSCLC cell lines (Supplementary Table
S1). As the inhibition of shRNA targeted genes sensitizes
NSCLC cells to geﬁtinib, we have dubbed these genes as
"SLuG"s, for Synthetic Lethal upon Geﬁtinib. The 104 synthetic
lethal genes found in both cell lines are denoted as SLuG2, and
those identiﬁed in a single cell line will be labeled SLuGH322C
and SLuGHCC4006. Note that SLuG2s are enriched in cancerrelated genes (see legend of Supplementary Table S1).
Among identiﬁed SLuGs were multiple genes with known
roles in protecting NSCLC or other cancer cells from EGFR
inhibition, which provides conﬁdence in the screening results.
Examples include: (i) MET (c-Met; SLuGH332C): ampliﬁcation of
which has been shown to contribute to preexisting and
acquired clinical resistance to EGFR inhibitors (20–22). (ii)
PIK3CA (SLuGH332C and phosphoinositide-3-kinase a subunit):
pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway

restores sensitivity in geﬁtinib-resistant tumor cell lines, forming the basis of a current phase I trial combining geﬁtinib with
everolimus (PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway inhibitor; ref. 23). (iii)
Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and the FGF receptor FGFR2
(both SLuGH332C): FGFR signaling has been shown to confer
intrinsic resistance to EGFR inhibition (24–26). (iv) BIRC5
(SLuG2): overexpression of BIRC5/survivin has been shown to
protect lung cancer cells from geﬁtinib-induced apoptosis, and
has been implicated in conferring resistance to geﬁtinib (27).
(v) PTPN11 (SHP2; SLuG2): inhibition of SHP2 has been shown
to sensitize to geﬁtinib (28), and (vi) SOS2 (SLUGHCC4006): SOS2
was recently discovered in a synthetic lethal siRNA screen with
EGFR inhibition in a cervical adenocarcinoma cell line (29).
Importantly, multiple SLuG gene products mapped throughout the Wnt/tankyrase/b-catenin pathway (Fig. 1C). In particular, TNKS1 was present as a SLuG2 and TNKS2 was identiﬁed
as a SLuGHCC4006. These poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes have
recently been shown to be key positive regulators of b-catenin–
dependent transcription by promoting the degradation of Axin
(14). The SLuG2 CSNK2A1 (casein kinase 2a; CK2a) has been
shown to promote canonical Wnt signaling by phosphorylation
of b-catenin, leading to decreased degradation and increased
transcriptional activity (30). Moreover, high expression of
CSNK2A1 is predictive of poor prognosis in NSCLC patients

(31). Additional SLuGs in this Wnt pathway include SLuGH322C
genes TCF3, DVL3, SMAD3, CCND1, WNT2B, PP2A, and DVL3, as
well as SLuGHCC4006 genes LRP8, FZD3, SMAD2, JUN, CSNK1A1
(CK1a), and APC2. Note that pathway genes include several
b-catenin/TCF target genes, including the SLuG2 BIRC5. Thus,
the inhibition of numerous components of the canonical Wnt
signaling pathway seems to potentiate geﬁtinib-mediated
elimination of NSCLC cells.
To validate screening results, we generated H322C sublines
expressing either negative control shRNAs or shRNAs targeting
TNKS1. Vectors from the TRC collection were used for validation of TNKS1 and other SLuGs (in each case, pools of retroviral
integrants), with shRNA sequences distinct from those used for
the screen. As expected, knockdown of TNKS1 decreased

mRNA levels of AXIN2 (Supplementary Fig. S2B), a well-characterized target of Wnt/b-catenin-dependent transcription
(32). Although TNKS1 knockdown had a mild effect on cell
expansion by itself, when coupled with geﬁtinib-mediated
EGFR inhibition, NSCLC cell expansion was greatly inhibited
(Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2A). We next asked whether
pharmacological inhibition of tankyrase activity, using the
small molecule inhibitor XAV939 (14), could also sensitize
NSCLC cells to EGFR inhibition. As shown in Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S2C, although exposure of H322C and
HCC4006 cells to XAV939 or geﬁtinib alone moderately inhibited proliferation, combination of the 2 drugs led to more
potent inhibition of cell expansion. In addition, pharmacological stabilization of Axin using endo-IWR1, which also reduces

(shScrbl) or shRNAs targeting TNKS1 (TNKS1-1) were treated in triplicate with vehicle (DMSO) or 500 nmol/L geﬁtinib (GEF) for 4 days, followed by
replating without drug for 4 more days. Viable cells were counted by ﬂow cytometry using PI-exclusion. B, H322C cells were treated in triplicate with DMSO or

b-catenin levels by inhibiting tankyrase (14, 33), also potentiated geﬁtinib-mediated elimination of H322C and HCC4006
cells (Fig. 2C). We validated the synergistic interaction of
geﬁtinib and XAV939 or endo-IWR1 using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays in
multiple NSCLC lines with varying sensitivities to geﬁtinib
(Fig. 2D, E and Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2E), including
H3255 (with activating EGFR mutation L858R) and Calu3 (with
increased wild-type EGFR gene copy number; ref. 19). Note that
synergism is strongest in the EGFR mutant lines. Importantly,
we further showed that treatment with the FDA approved
EGFR inhibitor erlotinib also synergized with XAV939 to
reduce NSCLC cell expansion (Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig.
S2E). Interestingly, cell lines that are not driven by EGFR
mutation or ampliﬁcation, such as H3122 (ALK fusion) and
human foreskin ﬁbroblasts are not affected by the combinatorial treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2F and S2G) and tankyrase inhibition does not synergize with the ﬁrst line NSCLC
chemotherapeutic paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S2H), thus

suggesting a unique reliance on Wnt signaling in EGFR-dependent cancers after EGFR inhibition. Finally, we showed that
combined treatment of H322C or HCC4006 cells with geﬁtinib
and either XAV939 or endo-IWR1 resulted in enhanced elimination of colony forming ability (Fig. 3A).
Although XAV939 alone did not affect cell-cycle proﬁles,
H322C cells treated with geﬁtinib exhibited an increase of cells
in G1 and a decrease in S-phase (Fig. 3B), as expected. Notably,
cells treated with both geﬁtinib and XAV939 exhibited an even
greater number of cells in G1 phase with a corresponding
decrease in S and G2–M phases relative to geﬁtinib alone.
Although geﬁtinib treatment alone does increase the proportion of H322C cells undergoing apoptosis (Supplementary Fig.
S3A), combined treatment with XAV939 only modestly
increased the presence of apoptotic cells detected by
Annexin-V staining. But notably, the combination treatment
resulted in more cells with senescence-associated b-galactosidase staining than geﬁtinib alone (Fig. 3C and Supplementary
Fig. S3B), indicating that the combinatorial treatment causes

for 4 days, and then replated without drugs for colony forming assays. B, H322C cells were treated as in Fig. 2B for 72 hours and cell-cycle proﬁles analyzed by

determined by RT-PCR. Dotted line at y ¼ 1 represents levels in DMSO-treated samples.

increased senescence to H332C cells. Moreover, known Wnt/
b-catenin targets (AXIN2, MYC, and BIRC5) are differentially
modulated by the inhibition of EGFR and TNKS (Fig. 3D). As
expected, AXIN2 mRNA levels are decreased by XAV939 treatment, but surprisingly increased 2-fold by geﬁtinib. Interestingly, the combination of geﬁtinib and XAV939 induce a
synergistic surge of AXIN2 mRNA levels. Whereas MYC mRNA
levels are reduced by either geﬁtinib or XAV939 alone, the
combinatorial treatment results in further reductions in MYC
message levels. Finally, BIRC5 mRNA levels are reduced by
geﬁtinib treatment, but seem unaffected by XAV939 alone. In
summary, our results indicate that inhibiting both EGFR and
TNKS synergistically impairs the proliferation of NSCLC cells,
correlating with a marked increase in senescence, and altered
mRNA levels of various Wnt target genes (model in Supplementary Fig. S3C).
We next sought to validate other SLuGs that also mapped to
the canonical Wnt pathway. Wnt signaling is tightly controlled
with multiple levels of feedback. For example, whereas CK1a
can phosphorylate b-catenin and thus target it for destruction

(34), it also can destabilize the destruction complex, thus
promoting canonical Wnt signaling (35). As shown in Fig.
4A and B and Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4E, knockdown
of either CSNK1A1 (CK1a) or CSNK2A1 (CK2a) impaired the
proliferation and colony forming ability of H322C cells, and
sensitized these cells to EGFR inhibition with geﬁtinib. Interestingly, pyrvinium, a small-molecule CK1a activator recently
showed to inhibit the Wnt/b-catenin pathway (ref. 36; EC50 
10 nmol/L), synergistically increases geﬁtinib-mediated inhibition of H322C and HCC4006 cells (Fig. 4C and Supplementary
S4F and S4G). Pyrvinium has been an FDA approved an antihelminth drug for >50 years, and is a potent, speciﬁc, and direct
activator of CK1a (36). Although it may seem counterintuitive
that both activation (with pyrvinium) and inhibition (with
shRNAs) of CK1a would sensitize NSCLC cells to geﬁtinib, as
mentioned earlier, previous studies have also suggested dual
roles for CK1a in both positive and negative modulation of
Wnt signaling (37). Notably, pyrvinium does not synergize
with paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S4H) in NSCLC cells or
with geﬁtinib in human foreskin ﬁbroblasts (Supplementary

Fig. S4I). These data reinforce the importance of appropriate
regulation of Wnt signaling for NSCLC maintenance during
EGFR inhibition (Fig. 4D).
Given the apparent importance of Wnt signaling in residual
cell maintenance during geﬁtinib treatment, we directly
assessed the contribution of b-catenin, even though it was
not identiﬁed as a SLuG. Even modest knockdown of b-catenin
had an inhibitory effect on cell expansion by itself, but when
coupled with geﬁtinib, cell expansion was greatly inhibited
(Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Combined
treatment with geﬁtinib and a recently described small molecule, PNU74654, that can disrupt the interaction between
b-catenin and TCF4 (38), similarly led to enhanced inhibition
of NSCLC expansion (Fig. 5B). Moreover, knockdown of TCF4
also potentiated geﬁtinib efﬁcacy in both H322C and HCC4006
lines (Fig. 5C and Supplementary S5C). In summary, our results
indicate that blocking both EGFR and Wnt/b-Catenin pathways leads to enhanced inhibition of NSCLC cells.
We next asked whether pharmacological inhibition of the
Wnt/tankyrase/b-catenin pathway could cooperate with geﬁtinib by further inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. S6A, the inhibition of activating phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK, which is downstream of EGFR, after
geﬁtinib treatment in HCC4006 and H322C cells was not
affected by the addition of XAV939, pyrvinium, or PNU74654.
Thus, the ability of Wnt/tankyrase/b-catenin pathway inhibitors to sensitize NSCLC cells to geﬁtinib does not seems to be
because of augmented EGFR pathway inhibition. Moreover,

4160

XAV939 and endo-IWR1 treatments resulted in the expected
increase in AXIN1 protein levels (Fig. 6A and B). Finally, all
small molecules used to disrupt Wnt signaling (XAV939,
pyrvinium, and PNU74654) decrease AXIN2 mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
Although pharmacological manipulation of the Wnt/tankyrase/b-catenin pathway has clear relevance for potential clinical
applications, a caveat with the use of small-molecule inhibitors
is their inevitable off-target effects. Moreover, the inhibition of
enzymes such as tankyrase and CK1a will impact cellular
processes beyond Wnt signaling (37, 39). To determine the
extent to which the efﬁcacy of these inhibitors in cooperating
with geﬁtinib to impair NSCLC cell proliferation was through
inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway, we generated
HCC4006 cells that stably express an activated form of b-catenin (S33A/S37A/T41A/S45A; ref. 40; Supplementary Fig. S6C).
As shown in Fig. 6C, expression of activated b-catenin not only
partially protects NSCLC cells from geﬁtinib treatment, but
provides substantial protection from combined treatments
with either XAV939 þ geﬁtinib or pyrvinium þ geﬁtinib. This
b-catenin rescue is evident over a range of concentrations for
geﬁtinib, XAV939, and pyrvinium (Fig. 6D and Supplementary
Fig. S6D). Thus, the expression of activated b-catenin obviated
the effects of pyrvinium, and to a partial extent XAV939, in
terms of increasing HCC4006 inhibition after geﬁtinib treatment. Nonetheless, it is notable that activation of b-catenin
cannot fully rescue growth inhibition by high-dose pyrvinium
or XAV939 in the absence of geﬁtinib (Fig. 6C and D), which

could represent off-target effects of these drugs or impacts of
tankyrase inhibition beyond the b-catenin pathway. Still, the
ability of activated b-catenin expression to largely bypass
effects of the tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 and the CK1a
activator pyrvinium on enhancing geﬁtinib-mediated NSCLC
inhibition indicates that these small molecules, at least in good
measure, act by inhibiting the Wnt/b-catenin pathway.
Finally, we asked whether the inhibition of tankyrase could
sensitize NSCLC cells to EGFR inhibition in vivo. We injected
nude mice subcutaneously with H322C cells expressing either
negative control shRNAs (Scrbl) or shRNAs targeting TNKS1. As
shown in Fig. 7A and Supplementary Fig. S7, geﬁtinib treatment
delayed, but did not prevent, the outgrowth of the Scrbl shRNA
expressing tumor cells. In contrast, tumors expressing shRNAs
targeting TNKS1 showed a much more substantial inhibition of
tumor growth with geﬁtinib. H&E and Ki67 staining revealed
that tumors from geﬁtinib-treated mice exhibited reduced cell
density and proliferation, with greater reductions in cell density
for TNKS1 shRNA expressing tumors (Fig. 7B).

Discussion
Our results reveal that the Wnt/b-catenin pathway is critical
for NSCLC cell maintenance upon EGFR inhibition. Given that

www.aacrjournals.org

key enzymatic regulators of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway,
including tankyrase, can be inhibited by small molecules,
these studies reveal potential mechanisms to increase the
efﬁcacy of clinically-used EGFR inhibitors such as geﬁtinib
and erlotinib for the treatment of NSCLC. It is important to
emphasize that our screen was not designed to discover
acquired resistance mechanisms, but to reveal pathways that
maintain some EGFR-dependent NSCLC cells despite EGFR
inhibition. Clinical studies thus far have shown efﬁcacy for
small molecule EGFR inhibitors only for patients with NSCLC
bearing activating EGFR mutations (15% of cases; refs. 2, 6),
and even in these cases relapse is inevitable. Moreover,
our experiments indicate that targeting tankyrase and the
Wnt/b-catenin pathway may increase the efﬁcacy of EGFR
inhibitors for NSCLC that overexpress wild-type EGFR, which
could expand the number of patients that beneﬁt from antiEGFR therapies.
RNAi screens provide powerful tools to identify novel compensatory pathways upon TKI treatment (29, 41–43). Our
results highlight the strength of unbiased, genome-wide analyses, which provides unanticipated insight into the pathways
that maintain NSCLC cells. Notably, we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant
correlations between our SLuG2 list with genes that are

regulated after geﬁtinib treatment or genes known to be
mutated in lung cancers, and we found only very weak correlations with canonical Wnt target genes and geﬁtinib resistance
of NSCLC lines (Supplementary Fig. S5D and legend). These
results emphasize the importance of functional screens, as a
pathway does not need to be mutated or deregulated to
contribute to therapy resistance or maintenance of the cancer
phenotype (44). Importantly, tankyrases have been identiﬁed
by many pharmaceutical companies as attractive targets for
drug development (45), and our studies reveal a potentially
valuable application of tankyrase inhibitors for the treatment
of lung cancers.
Our results suggest that inhibition of EGFR and tankyrases could each impact b-catenin-dependent transcription through divergent mechanisms. Although XAV939 (but
not geﬁtinib) treated cells exhibited the expected increase
in AXIN1 protein levels, geﬁtinib treatment resulted in
increases in AXIN2 mRNA levels, with further increases
when combined with XAV939, coinciding with decreased
expression of Wnt/b-catenin target genes. Together with
previous demonstrations of crosstalk between EGFR and
canonical Wnt pathways (46, 47), these data suggest a more
complicated impact of EGFR and tankyrase inhibitors on
Wnt/b-catenin-dependent transcription than originally
anticipated.
Clinical experience thus far has indicated that single-agent,
molecularly-targeted chemotherapy will not be curative for

4162

NSCLC, or indeed for any advanced cancer. Given the molecular complexity of these cancers, compensatory survival pathways can mediate partial cancer cell maintenance and lead
to drug resistance. As shown in a recent report (48), there
is considerable heterogeneity in acquired resistance mechanisms in lung cancers, which become refractory to EGFR inhibitors, and one might envision that each patient's cancer will
require an individualized therapy. Indeed, activation of the
Wnt/tankyrase/b-catenin pathway should be examined as one
potential mechanism of acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted
therapies. Moreover, we would suggest that there are also
pathways, such as the Wnt/tankyrase/b-catenin pathway,
which may mediate intrinsic resistance to targeted therapies,
such as with EGFR inhibitors, in a wider range of NSCLC.
Nononcogene addiction of cancers (44), particularly when
speciﬁc to a context (such as EGFR inhibition) that the cancer
would presumably not have evolved to avoid prior to treatment, may be especially attractive for therapeutic targeting
together with the mutationally-activated primary pathway of
oncogene addiction.
In conclusion, our studies reveal the effectiveness of
genome-wide shRNA screens to discover resistance signaling
networks and to help exploit druggable pathways whose
inhibition can potentiate current therapeutics for cancer. In
particular, our results strongly implicate the Wnt/tankyrase/
b-catenin pathway as a promising therapeutic target for
NSCLC when combined with EGFR inhibition.
