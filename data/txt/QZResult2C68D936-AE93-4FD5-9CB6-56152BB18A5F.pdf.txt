ABSTRACT
Intrinsic cross-resistance to inhibition of different signaling pathways may
hamper development of combinatorial treatments in melanoma, but the relative
frequency of this phenotype and the strategies to overcome this hurdle remain
poorly understood. Among 49 BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines from patients not
previously treated with target therapy, 21 (42.9%) showed strong primary resistance
(IC50 > 1 μM) to a BRAFV600E inhibitor. Most of the BRAF-inhibitor-resistant cell
lines showed also strong or intermediate cross-resistance to MEK1/2- and to PI3K/
mTOR-specific inhibitors. Primary cross-resistance was confirmed in an independent
set of 23 BRAF-mutant short-term melanoma cell cultures. MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR
co-targeting was the most effective approach, compared to BRAF and PI3K/mTOR
dual blockade, to counteract primary resistance to BRAF inhibition and the crossresistant phenotype. This was shown by extensive drug interaction analysis, tumor
growth inhibition assays in-vivo, p-ERK and p-AKT inhibition, promotion of melanoma
apoptosis, apoptosis-related protein modulation, activation of effector caspases and
selective modulation of genes involved in melanoma drug resistance and belonging
to the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT canonical pathways. Compared to co-targeting
of mutant BRAF and PI3K/mTOR, the association of a MEK1/2 and a PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor was more effective in the activation of Bax and of caspase-3 and in the
induction of caspase-dependent melanoma apoptosis. Furthermore Bax silencing
reduced the latter effects. These results suggest that intrinsic resistance to BRAF
inhibition is frequently associated with primary cross-resistance to MEK and PI3K/
mTOR blockade in BRAF-mutant melanoma and provide pre-clinical evidence for a
combinatorial approach to counteract this phenotype.

INTRODUCTION

inhibitors. Extensive drug interaction analysis on all 49 cell
lines and mechanistic studies in cross-resistant cell lines
indicated that co-targeting of MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR,
in-vitro and in-vivo, was a more effective combinatorial
treatment, compared to co-targeting of BRAF and PI3K/
mTOR, to counteract the primary cross-resistant phenotype.

Inhibitors of BRAFV600E have changed the clinical
management of patients with BRAF-mutant advanced
melanoma, since significant improvements in progressionfree survival (PFS) and in overall survival (OS) have been
reported in Phase 3 trials [1–2]. These inhibitors can
induce objective responses or stabilization of disease in
a high fraction of patients [2–3], although relapse occurs
due to adaptive [4] or acquired [5] resistance mechanisms.
In addition, ~20% of patients show primary/intrinsic
resistance to BRAF inhibitors and experience tumor
progression at first assessment during therapy [2–3].
Lack of response has been observed even in trials with
MEK inhibitors as Trametinib and Selumetinib/AZD6244
[6–7], pointing to primary resistance also to the targeting
of MEK. To counteract resistance to BRAF inhibitors,
several clinical trials based on combinatorial targeting
of BRAF and MEK have been carried out recently, and
results have indicated a significant improvement in PFS
and (in one study) in OS, compared to monotherapy with
the BRAF inhibitor alone [8–10]. However, strikingly, in
all these studies ~30% of the patients showed progressive
disease at 6 months of treatment [8–10], pointing to the
potential role of cross-resistance mechanisms. Indeed,
primary cross-resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors has
been documented in a subset of melanomas, where it is
related to the MITF profile [11–13], and in cell lines [14].
In the attempt to address all these limitations
associated with targeting of a single (MAPK) pathway,
several pre-clinical studies have suggested that combi­
natorial targeting of MAPK and PI3K/mTOR intracellular
pathways may be a potential approach to improve target
therapy of melanoma and to overcome resistance and
cross-resistance mechanisms [14–17]. However, key
questions to be answered are whether BRAF-mutated
melanomas, with intrinsic resistance to BRAF and/or
MEK inhibitors, also have primary cross-resistance to
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and which is the frequency of such
cross-resistant phenotype. A second issue to be addressed
is whether combinatorial targeting of different signaling
pathways is effective even in the tumors with primary
cross-resistance.
Recently, we observed instances of primary crossresistance to a MEK1/2 (AZD6244) and to a dual PI3K/
mTOR (BEZ235) inhibitor in some melanoma cell lines
(18). Starting from this initial evidence, in this study we
assessed responsiveness to BRAFV600E-, MEK1/2-,
dual PI3K/mTOR- and dual mTORC1/2-specific inhibitors
in 49 BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines and in an
independent set of 23 BRAF-mutant short-term melanoma
cell cultures, all isolated from patients never treated with
target therapy. Among cell lines with strong intrinsic
resistance to the BRAF inhibitor (IC50 > 1 μM, n = 21),
81% (seventeen) showed strong or intermediate crossresistance to the MEK1/2- and the PI3K/mTOR-specific

RESULTS
Primary resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition
is associated with cross-resistance to MEK1/2
and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in BRAF-mutant
melanoma cells
We used 49 BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines
isolated from surgical specimens of patients not previously
treated with BRAFV600E inhibitors, nor with any
other target-specific inhibitor, to test responsiveness to
BRAFV600E (PLX4720), MEK1/2 (AZD6244), dual
PI3K/mTOR (BEZ235) and dual mTORC1/2 (AZD8055)
inhibitors (Figure 1A). Three susceptibility groups were
defined by ranking cell lines based on their IC50 values for
PLX4720. Strong resistance (IC50 > 1 μM) was found in
21/49 cell lines (42.9%, group 1), intermediate resistance
(IC50 = 0.1 to 1 μM) and susceptibility (IC50 < 0.1 μM) to
PLX4720 were observed in 16/49 (32.7%, group 2) and
12/49 cell lines (24.5%, group 3), respectively (Figure 1A
and Supplementary Table 1D for descriptive statistics).
Seventeen out of 21 melanoma lines (marked with an
“x” in Figure  1A) classified in group 1, showed either
strong or intermediate primary resistance to MEK1/2 and
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Strong or intermediate crossresistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors was also found in
11/16 cell lines in group 2, while only two cell lines in
group 3 (PLX4720 susceptible) showed strong resistance
to the PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (Figure 1A). Hierarchical
clustering of log-transformed and normalized IC50 values
confirmed the existence of distinct subsets of cell lines
with cross-resistance to all inhibitors or susceptible to
all of them (Figure 2A). Spearman correlation analysis
of IC50 values for all six possible combinations of four
inhibitors showed that all the susceptibility profiles were
significantly correlated (Figure 2B).
To validate these findings, an independent panel of
short-term melanoma cell cultures (all tested between the
third and fifth in-vitro passage), obtained from 23 BRAFmutant metastatic specimens of patients not previously
treated with target-specific inhibitors, was used to test
responsiveness to the same set of inhibitors. The same
classification into three subsets based on ranking of
PLX4720 IC50 values was applied. We found that 6/6
PLX4720-resistant melanoma cell cultures (group 1)
showed strong (i.e. IC50  >  1  μM) or intermediate
(i.e. IC50  >  0.1  μM) cross-resistance to MEK1/2 and
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, and 11/13 cultures in group 2
(intermediate resistance to PLX4720) showed also strong

or intermediate cross-resistance to PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
(Figure 3A). As a control, 10 short-term melanoma cell
cultures from tumors with wt BRAF were characterized
for responsiveness to the four inhibitors. As expected [19],
all the BRAF wt melanoma cell cultures were strongly
resistant to PLX4720, but some of them also showed
strong resistance to the MEK1/2 or to the PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors (Figure 3B). Interestingly, the melanoma cell
culture Me_cc135, with intermediate cross-resistance, was
isolated from a specimen of a patient who subsequently
(4.4 months after Me_cc135 isolation) was treated with a
BRAF inhibitor and underwent progressive disease after
two cycles of therapy. In contrast, melanoma cell cultures
Me_cc111 and Me_cc128, with a cross-susceptible
phenotype, were isolated from patients who subsequently
(75.4 and 2.8 months, after Me_cc111 and Me_cc128
isolation, respectively) were treated with the association
of a BRAF and a MEK inhibitor or in monotherapy with
a MEK inhibitor and experienced a partial response or a
complete response, respectively.
Twelve days clonogenic assays on representative
cell lines (Me43 and Me71) and short-term melanoma
cell cultures (Me_cc117 and Me_cc128) from the

cross-susceptible group 3 (Supplementary Figure 1A),
indicated a strong suppression of melanoma growth by
AZD6244, PLX4720, BEZ235 and AZD8055, often
detected at the lowest inhibitor dose (0.1 μM). In contrast,
clonogenic assays on representative cell lines (Me35, Me6,
Me13) and short-term melanoma cell cultures (Me_cc102)
from group 1 (Supplementary Figure 1B) showed a partial
or markedly reduced inhibitory effect by AZD6244 (on
Me35 and Me_cc102), by PLX4720 (on Me35, Me6, Me13
and Me_cc102), and by AZD8055 (on Me35, Me13 and
Me_cc102). BEZ235 exerted a reduced inhibitory effect
on Me35, even at the highest dose, in agreement with the
high IC50 value in this cell line (Supplementary Figure 1B).
Taken together, these assays confirmed that cell lines and
short-term melanoma cell cultures in group 1 showed
markedly reduced responsiveness to multiple inhibitors.
The panel of 49 melanoma cell lines shown in
Figure 1, was further characterized for several molecular or
phenotypic features associated with drug resistance [20–23],
but no significant association was found, between the drug
susceptibility groups and: a) the PTEN, MDM4 and MDM2
expression levels; b) the constitutive p-ERK, p-AKT and
p-S6 levels (Supplementary Table 1A–1C and 1E–1G).

We also assessed the MITF phenotype of the cell lines and
short-term melanoma cell cultures, as either high or low
expression of this transcription factor has been associated
with drug resistance in melanoma [11–13]. We found that
melanoma cell lines retained the MITF phenotype of the
corresponding lesions, but both MITFhi and MITFlo cell
lines and short term cultures were found in each of the
three susceptibility groups (data not shown).
Taken together, these results indicated that intrinsic
resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition can be frequently
associated with cross-resistance to MEK1/2 and/or PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells.

by the Chou-Talalay method [24]. To this end, 49 cell
lines belonging to the three susceptibility groups were
treated with AZD6244-BEZ235, or PLX4720-BEZ235 or
AZD6244-AZD8055 associations. For each association
of inhibitors, twelve different combinations of doses
(indicated at the top of Figure 4A) were evaluated,
yielding a 1,764-point drug interaction matrix (49 cell
lines by 36 drug combinations). Strong synergistic
effects, documented by CI values < 0.3 (Figure 4A and
4B for color codes and meaning of CI values and
Supplementary Table 2 for primary data), were achieved
on almost all cell lines from group 2 and 3. Interestingly,
strong synergism was observed at most drug dosing
combinations, against 20/21 melanoma cell lines in
group 1 (Figure 4A), including 16/17 lines with the crossresistant phenotype (Figure 4A, arrows). By clonogenic
assays (Supplementary Figure 2A, 2B) AZD6244-BEZ235
and PLX4720-BEZ235 combinatorial treatments exerted a
strong inhibitory effect on melanoma growth not only on
two cell lines from group 3 (Me43 and Me71), but also on
three cell lines from group 1 (Me35, Me6, Me13).

Co-targeting of MAPK and PI3K/mTOR
pathways in melanoma cells with a primary
cross-resistant phenotype has synergistic effects
in vitro and anti-tumor activity in vivo
To test whether combinatorial targeting of MAPK
and PI3K/mTOR pathways could overcome primary
cross-resistance, we performed drug interaction analysis

Group 3 as defined in Figure 1). Results for each of the indicated combinations of inhibitors (drug doses listed at the top of the Figure), for

dose compared to AZD6244 (see legend to Figure 5). In
these normalized conditions, the AZD6244-BEZ235 and
AZD6244-AZD8055 associations were more effective
than PLX4720-BEZ235 at inhibiting p-ERK in Me13
after O/N treatment, and AZD6244-BEZ235 was the
most effective treatment as suppressing p-ERK in
Me6 (Figure 5). AZD6244-BEZ235 was also the most
effective treatment at inhibiting p-AKT in Me13 and
Me6 (Figure 5). All three treatments showed similar
inhibitory activity on p-S6 (Figure 5). Enhanced p-ERK
inhibition by AZD6244-BEZ235 and AZD6244-AZD8055
compared to PLX4720-BEZ235 were observed also
on Me79, a strongly cross-resistant cell line in group1
(Figure 5) as well as on Me71, a cell line from group 3
susceptible to all inhibitors (Supplementary Figure 6).
The enhanced suppression of p-ERK by AZD6244BEZ235 and AZD6244-AZD8055 treatments, compared
to PLX4720-BEZ235, was confirmed even after a shorter
(4 h) treatment on melanoma cell lines from group 1
(Me13 and Me79, Supplementary Figure 7). At 4 h of
treatment, AZD6244-BEZ235 and PLX4720-BEZ235
were effective in suppressing p-AKT on Me13 and Me79,
while inhibition of pS6 by the combinatorial treatments
was strongly reduced on Me13 and not observed on Me79
compared to the effects detected on the same cell lines after
O/N treatment (see Supplementary Figure 7 vs. Figure 5).
Enhanced inhibition of p-ERK and p-AKT by AZD6244BEZ235 compared to PLX4720-BEZ235, and to control
animals treated with vehicle, was also observed in-vivo,
as indicated by a reduced staining for p-ERK and p-AKT
in melanoma cells from neoplastic nodules removed after
the last administration of inhibitors (Figure 6A, 6B and
Supplementary Figure 8 for quantitative analysis).
Taken together, these results indicated that the asso­
ciation of MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors induces
a more effective inhibition of p-ERK at both early and
late time points compared to BRAF and PI3K/mTOR dual
blockade, in PLX4720-resistant melanoma cells and even
in cell lines with a cross-resistant phenotype.

In addition, the AZD6244-BEZ235 combination
induced a significantly stronger synergistic effect (lower
CI values) against the whole panel of 49 melanoma cell
lines compared to PLX4720-BEZ235, in three out of
nine experimental conditions where both AZD6244 and
PLX4720 were present at equivalent doses (Figure 4A,
statistical comparisons highlighted by blue lines and
asterisks).
In addition to a combination index matrix, the drug
interaction analysis yielded also a 1,764-point Fraction
Affected (FA) matrix (Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B
for color coding of FA values and Supplementary Table
3 for primary data). Analysis of the FA matrix led to
two main conclusions. First, combinatorial treatment
with AZD6244-BEZ235 or PLX4720-BEZ235, but to a
much lesser extent with AZD6244-AZD8055, allowed to
achieve FA values > 0.50, or even > 0.70, on most crossresistant cell lines in group 1. Second, and most relevant,
in each of the 9 matched drug combinations (identified by
matched symbols at bottom of Supplementary Figure 3A)
where AZD6244 and PLX4720 were used at equivalent
doses, AZD6244-BE235 induced significantly higher FA
values compared to PLX4720-BEZ235 on the 21 cell lines
in group 1, characterized by strong primary resistance to
PLX4720 and by frequent cross-resistance (Supplementary
Figure 4A, 4B for statistical analysis).
We then compared anti-tumor activity in-vivo of
AZD6244-BEZ235 and PLX4720-BEZ235 combinatorial
treatments. To this end, we established a SCID mouse
model based on s.c. xenograft of a cell line from group 1
(Me13). This cell line was characterized by strong primary
resistance to PLX4720 (IC50 > 1 μM) and by intermediate
resistance to AZD6244 and BEZ235 (IC50 > 0.1 μM). Both
treatments exerted a significant inhibitory effect on tumor
growth, compared to control animals treated with vehicle,
but the AZD6244-BEZ235 association was signifi­
cantly more effective than PLX4720-BEZ235 treatment
(Supplementary Figure 5). Moreover, no evident signs of
treatment-related toxicity were observed (data not shown).
Taken together, the in-vitro and in-vivo experiments
indicated that co-targeting of MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR
has improved anti-tumor activity compared to co-targeting
of mutant BRAF and PI3K/mTOR even in melanoma cells
with an intrinsic cross-resistant phenotype.

Enhanced apoptotic response in melanoma cells
with a cross-resistant phenotype by co-targeting
of MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR
The most significant effect of AZD6244-BEZ235,
compared to PLX4720-BEZ235 and to AZD6244-AZD8055,
was a reciprocal shift in the sub-G1 and G1 fractions, while
S and G2M phases of the cell cycle were not differentially
affected, as documented by DNA content analysis
(Supplementary Figure 9) in representative melanoma cell
lines from the three PLX4720 susceptibility groups. This
result was consistent with enhanced induction of cell death
by AZD6244-BEZ235. By annexin-V/PI staining assays we
compared extent of apoptosis induced by single inhibitors
and by the three combinatorial treatments on representative
cell lines from the three groups. To this end, inhibitors

MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR co-targeting is more
effective than BRAF and PI3K/mTOR dual
blockade in inhibition of signaling molecule
phosphorylation in PLX4720-resistant and in
cross-resistant melanoma cell lines
Changes in the phosphorylation status of ERK, AKT
and S6 by the combinatorial treatments were assessed in
three cell lines from group 1 (Me13, Me6 and Me79).
Me13 and Me6 have a higher IC50 for PLX4720 than
for AZD6244, therefore PLX4720 was used at a higher

doses were tailored to each melanoma group based on the
different IC50 values (see legend, Figure 7). By annexin-V/
PI stainings we compared the extent of apoptosis induced
by the three combinatorial treatments. AZD6244-BEZ235
was found to be the most effective association, not only
against representative cell lines from groups 2 and 3
(Figure 7), but even against melanoma cells with the strong
(Me79) or intermediate (Me13) cross-resistant phenotype

in group 1 (Figure 7). Further apoptosis assays were carried
out by comparing the three combinatorial treatments on all
49 melanoma cell lines. These experiments confirmed that
AZD6244-BEZ235 was more effective than PLX4720BEZ235 against the cell lines in group 1 and group 2
(Supplementary Figure 10A).
By protein arrays experiments we found that
AZD6244-BEZ235 was more effective than PLX4720-

BEZ235 at enhancing expression of the Bax protein, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and at downregulating
the inhibitor of apoptosis c-IAP1 in melanoma cells from
the three groups and of livin/ML-IAP in melanoma cells
from group 1 and 2 (Figure 8). By staining Me6 melanoma
cells with the 6A7 antibody, recognizing conformational
changes of Bax, one of the early steps in the induction
of apoptosis, we found a significantly increased fraction
of Bax+ melanoma cells upon treatment for 24 h with
AZD6344-BEZ235 compared to PLX4720-BEZ235 and
to AZD6244-AZD8055 (Figure 9A, 9B). Silencing of
Bax in Me6, by siRNA (Figure 9C), significantly reduced
activation of caspase-3 and (Figure 9D, 9E) and apoptosis
(Figure 9F) upon treatment with AZD6344-BEZ235 or
PLX4720-BEZ235.
On the basis of these results, we then tested whether
co-targeting of MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR could lead to

enhanced activation of effector caspases [25] on most cell
lines, compared to the other associations. In agreement,
AZD6244-BEZ235 combination was more effective than
PLX4720-BEZ235 and AZD6244-AZD8055 associations
in inducing caspase 3/7 enzymatic activation in assays
carried out on all 49 melanoma cell lines (Supplementary
Figure 10B). Further assays looking at the generation
of active, cleaved caspase-3, indicated that AZD6244BEZ235 was the most effective treatment, compared
to PLX4720-BEZ235 and to AZD6244-AZD8055 in
melanoma cells from group 3 (Me71) and from group 1
(Me6, Me13 and Me79, Supplementary Figure 11A, 11B).
Assessment of neoplastic nodules removed after the
last administration of inhibitors from mice receiving
the combinatorial treatments indicated an enhanced
activation of caspase-3, associated with induction of
apoptosis (TUNEL+ cells), in tumors from mice treated

stacked bar charts in Supplementary Figure 15). Thus,
upon combinatorial treatment with AZD6244-BEZ235,
the two top canonical pathways affected were the “PI3K/
AKT signaling”, and the “PTEN signaling”. In contrast,
upon melanoma treatment with PLX4720-BEZ235 or with
AZD6244-AZD8055 these two pathways ranked third and
second, or 15th and sixth, respectively (Supplementary
Figure 15).
By looking at genes belonging to three canonical
pathways (ERK/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and “prostate
cancer signaling”) specific differences in the modulatory
effects induced by the three combinatorial treatments
were identified (highlighted by red arrows in Figure 10
and Supplementary Figure 16A–16C). This comparison
indicated that AZD6244-BEZ235 induced a selective
downmodulation of several genes, including c-FOS
(Figure 10A), recently involved in melanoma resistance
to MAPK inhibition [13], and p90RSK encoding for
proteins that phosphorylate CREB transcription factors
[27–28], also involved in melanoma resistance to
MAPK inhibition [13]. The preferential downmodulation
of c-FOS by AZD6244-BEZ235, compared to the
effects of the other associations of inhibitors, was
confirmed by qPCR (Supplementary Figure  17A).
AZD6244-BEZ235, but not PLX4720-BEZ235,
downmodulated the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and
the mTOR interactor 4EBP1 (Figure 10B), as well as
β catenin, a gene that impairs T cell-mediated immune
response in melanoma [29], and LEF-1 [30] a β catenin
interacting partner (Supplementary Figure 16B, 16C).
The latter two genes are upstream of cyclin D1, a gene
being more strongly inhibited (FC = −3.85) by AZD6244BEZ235, compared to PLX4720-BEZ235 (FC = −2.17).
β catenin downmodulation by AZD6244-BEZ235
treatment was confirmed by qPCR (data not shown). By
immunohistochemistry in neoplastic nodules removed
after the last administration of inhibitors, a reduced
staining for β catenin was observed in melanoma cells
from animals treated with AZD6244-BEZ235 compared
to animals receiving vehicle or the PLX4720-BEZ235
combination (Supplementary Figure 17B).
Collectively, this evidence indicates that the
AZD6244-BEZ235 association has an enhanced effect
on the biological function “cell death and survival” and
a selective modulatory effect on genes that play a role in
melanoma resistance to target-specific inhibitors and in
suppression of anti-tumor immunity.

with AZD6244-BEZ235 compared to PLX4720-BEZ25
(Supplementary Figure 12).
In-vitro, a pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, but not
the negative control z-FA-fmk, significantly reduced Me6
cells apoptosis promoted by the combinatorial treatments,
indicating that melanoma apoptosis was caspasedependent (Supplementary Figure 13A, 13B).
Taken together, these results suggest that co-targeting
of MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR, compared to BRAF and PI3K/
mTOR dual blockade, is a more effective approach to rescue
susceptibility to caspase-dependent apoptosis in melanoma
cells with intrinsic cross-resistant phenotype.

Selective modulation of genes in the ERK/MAPK
and PI3K/AKT canonical pathways by MEK1/2
and PI3K/mTOR dual blockade compared to
BRAF and PI3K/mTOR co-targeting
Whole genome gene expression analysis was carried
out in the PLX4720-resistant Me13 cell line treated with
AZD6244-BEZ235, or PLX4720-BEZ235 or AZD6244AZD8055 associations, to identify combination-specific
effects. To improve the statistical analysis of the results,
three independent biological replicates for each treatment
were analyzed. Moreover, drug doses were chosen
according to the different IC50 values; thus, PLX4720
was used at 0.5 μM while AZD6244 was used at 0.1 μM
(see Materials and methods for details). Significantly
modulated genes by each combination, identified by class
comparison through BRB Array Tools, were subjected
to downstream effect analysis through IPA software.
“Cell death and survival” was the top biological function
affected by the three combinatorial treatments, but the most
significant P value for association with such function was
observed for the AZD6244-BEZ235 treatment (data not
shown). Based on Z scores > 2 or < -2, the function “cell
death” was predicted to be increased, while the function
“proliferation” was predicted to be decreased by the three
combinatorial treatments (see Supplementary Table 4 for
results on AZD6244-BEZ235 treatment). By EdwardsVENN diagram analysis [26] combination-specific gene
expression changes were identified (Supplementary
Figure 14, underlined values) in addition to gene
expression changes shared by two or even three different
combinatorial treatments (Supplementary Figure 14,
boxed values). Thus, AZD6244-BEZ235 upregulated
a set of 79 genes and downregulated a different set of
83 genes, not significantly affected by the other two
combinatorial treatments. By canonical pathway analysis
by IPA (Supplementary Figure 15), the specificity of each
combinatorial treatment was revealed by two parameters:
a) the different ranking of each of the top 15 pathways
(based on the P value of the association of the genes with
the pathway) and, b) the differences, among the three
combinatorial treatments, in the fraction of significantly
modulated genes belonging to each pathway (plotted as

DISCUSSION
Intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors prevents
~20% of melanoma patients with BRAF-mutant tumors
from achieving clinical benefit from this type of target
therapy and represents a major clinical issue [31, for
review]. In this subset of patients, combination treatments
based on co-targeting of different oncogenic pathways

have been suggested as a potentially effective approaches
[32], but the best combinatorial association has not been
identified yet. Clinical studies of combinatorial treatment
with MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors are ongoing in
different solid tumors, including melanoma (source:
www.clinicaltrials.gov) and results of published trials [33]
suggest that dual targeting of these pathways has clinical
activity, although toxicity issues have been identified.
Moreover, pre-clinical studies, in different tumors suggest
that co-targeting of MAPK and PI3K/mTOR pathways
may be a potentially promising strategy, as shown by
results obtained in gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells [34],
in pancreatic cancer cells [35], in rhabdomyosarcoma cells
[36], in NRAS mutant melanoma cells [17] and in BRAF
mutant melanoma cells with acquired resistance mediated
by upregulation of PDGFRβ [16].
In this study we provide novel preclinical evidence
indicating that primary resistance to BRAF inhibition
is not only frequently associated with cross-resistance
to MEK1/2 inhibitors, but even with cross-resistance to
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Based on this evidence, we
tested whether a combinatorial treatment approach could
be effective in the subset of melanoma cells with the
intrinsic cross-resistant phenotype. The results indicated
that the most significant synergistic effects (as determined
by combination index values) could be achieved by cotargeting of MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR. Co-targeting
of MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR was significantly more
effective than BRAF and PI3K/mTOR dual blockade
not only in-vitro, but also in-vivo, against xenografts
from a cell line with intrinsic resistance to the BRAF
inhibitor PLX4720. The anti-melanoma efficacy of the
AZD6244-BEZ235 treatment was associated with strong
inhibition of key signaling molecules, as documented by
modulation of p-ERK and of p-AKT, both in-vitro and
in-vivo. Interestingly, in melanoma cells with acquired
resistance to BRAF inhibition, Shi et al. [16] found that
PLX4720, alone or in combination with BEZ235 or
AZD8055, induced early and delayed p-ERK recovery,
while AZD6244 in association with BEZ235 or AZD8055,
strongly reduced such effect.
Assessment of the mechanism(s) involved in the
enhanced anti-melanoma efficacy by co-targeting of
MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR, compared to mutant BRAF
and PI3K/mTOR dual inhibition, provided evidence
for a more effective induction of apoptosis, not only
in-vitro, but also in-vivo and even in cross-resistant
cell lines. Treatment by AZD6244-BEZ235 was
associated with enhanced modulation of pro- and antiapoptotic molecules, compared to PLX4720-BEZ235
and to AZD6244-AZD8055. Further assessment of the
mechanism of melanoma apoptosis, after dual pathway
co-targeting, indicated that AZD6244-BEZ235 was the
most effective combination at inducing activation of Bax
and of caspase-3, the latter effect being observed both
in-vitro and in-vivo. Silencing of Bax reduced both
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

caspase-3 activation and melanoma apoptosis. Further
assays with a pan-caspase inhibitor also indicated that
melanoma apoptosis was significantly inhibited by a
pan-caspase inhibitor, suggesting that one of the relevant
effects of the combinatorial treatments is to rescue
susceptibility of melanoma to caspase-dependent cell
death.
Analysis for combination-specific effects on gene
expression, provided evidence for selective modulation
of genes belonging to the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT
canonical pathways by the AZD6244-BEZ235, compared
to PLX4720-BEZ235 and to AZD6244-AZD8055. The
inhibitory effects on c-FOS, and on genes (p90RSK)
encoding proteins that affect CREB phosphorylation,
suggest that AZD6244-BEZ235 is a potentially effective
approach to overcome recently described mechanisms
mediating melanoma resistance to MAPK inhibition
[13]. In agreement with this interpretation, caspase 3/7
activation assays and cell death assays indicated that
AZD6244-BEZ235 was significantly more effective in
the promotion of apoptosis on melanoma cell lines of
all susceptibility groups. Thus, these results support the
notion that rescuing susceptibility to apoptosis is a major
mechanism of action of effective co-targeting strategies
in melanoma, as reported previously by us [18, 37–38],
and other groups in melanoma [16] and other tumors [35].
The selective downmodulation of β catenin, by
AZD6244-BEZ235 compared to PLX4720-BEZ235,
suggests that dual blockade of the MAPK and PI3K/
mTOR pathways could suppress a recently discovered
mechanism that melanoma cells exploit to suppress
development of T cell mediated anti-tumor response
[29] and provides a further rationale for the association
of target therapy, based on dual pathway inhibition, with
immune checkpoint blockade, an approach that has greatly
improved the management of advanced disease [39].
Analysis of responsiveness to BRAF, MEK1/2 and
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in a few short term melanoma
cell cultures, from patients subsequently treated with
target therapy, suggested that drug susceptibility data
may predict response or resistance to treatment. Clearly,
this hypothesis needs confirmation in a larger set of
patients, but the testing of freshly isolated melanoma cells
from surgical samples, for responsiveness to available
inhibitors, is feasible in principle in advanced melanoma
and could provide a valuable evidence to inform
subsequent clinical decisions.

followed by Image J quantification of images. Results
of clonogenic assays were expressed as % inhibition
of melanoma growth. For drug interaction analysis the
Chou and Talalay method was used [24]. To this end,
MTT assays were set up testing three combinations of
inhibitors (AZD6244-BEZ235, PLX4720-BEZ235 and
AZD6244-AZD8055). For each combinatorial treatment,
twelve different combinations of doses were used. Data
were then analyzed to obtain Combination index (CI) and
Fraction Affected (FA) values by the CompuSyn software
(ComboSyn).

Cell lines and short-term melanoma cell cultures
Forty-nine BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines
were established as described [18, 37–38, 40–41] from
surgical specimens of American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) stage IIIc and IV melanoma patients not
previously subjected to target therapy. An independent
panel of 33 short-term melanoma cell cultures was
generated as described [40–41] from surgical samples of
AJCC stage IIIc and IV BRAF mutant (n = 23) or wild
type (n = 10) patients not previously subjected to target
therapy. Short-term melanoma cell cultures were used
between the third and fifth in-vitro passage. All patients
were admitted to Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale
dei Tumori, Milan and all the lesions were histologically
confirmed to be cutaneous malignant melanomas. Informed
consent was obtained from patients. Molecular and
biological characterization of the cell lines and methods
for identification of mutations in BRAF gene have been
reported previously [18, 37–38, 41–42].

Antibodies and western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was carried out by the following
antibodies specific for: AKT, p-AKT (Ser473), ERK 1/2,
p-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), S6, p-S6 (Ser235/236), PTEN
and Bax (Cell Signaling); MDM4 (Bethyl Laboratories),
MDM2 (Santa Cruz), β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), α-tubulin
(Calbiochem) and Vinculin (Sigma-Aldrich). SDS-PAGE
was performed using 30  μg of protein samples on 4%–12%
NuPAGE Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen Life
Technologies), as described [18, 37–38]. Development
was performed by the chemiluminescence method with the
ECL Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare)
or Luminata Crescendo (Millipore). Basal/constitutive
phosphoprotein characterization was carried out after
O/N culture without FCS. Modulation of expression of
phosphoproteins, by inhibitors, was assessed in melanoma
cells treated either for 4 hr or O/N with MAPK and PI3K/
mTOR pathways inhibitors, alone or in combinations,
with 2% FCS. Protein quantification was performed by
densitometric analysis with the Quantity One software
(BioRad Laboratories).

Treatment of melanoma cells with inhibitors and
drug interaction analysis
Two days before treatment, melanoma cells were
seeded in 96-wells flat bottom plates in RPMI 1640
(BioWhittaker) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum
(FCS) without antibiotics. For IC50 determination,
treatments were in quadruplicate with AZD6244 (MEK1/2
inhibitor, SelleckChem), PLX4720 (BRAFV600E
inhibitor, SelleckChem), BEZ235 (dual PI3K and mTOR
inhibitor, SelleckChem), AZD8055 (dual mTORC1/2 inhibitor,
SelleckChem). Stocks and dilutions of inhibitors were
done in DMSO. Twelve concentrations of each inhibitor
ranging from 1 nM to 10 μM at final FCS concentration
of 1% were used. Cultures were evaluated at 72 hours as
described [18, 37–38] by the 3-(4, 5) dimethylthiazol-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. IC50 values
were obtained through nonlinear regression analysis (by
PRISM software, Graphpad) of dose-response curves by
a log (inhibitor) vs. response, variable slope equation.
Clonogenic assays were performed by seeding melanoma
cells at single-cell density in 6-well plates. Treatments
with AZD6244, BEZ235, PLX4720, and AZD8055
(0.1–0.5 μM), either alone or in combination, vs. DMSO
were done every 72 h. After 12 days, the supernatant was
discarded, plates were washed with HBSS, fixed with
methanol and then stained with Giemsa (Sigma Aldrich)

In-vivo evaluation of anti-melanoma activity of
combinatorial treatments
Female SCID mice, 8–10 weeks old (Charles River
Laboratories) were provided with food and water ad
libitum. Melanoma cells (Me13), harvested in exponential
growth phase, were injected s.c. (5x106) in the left flank
of each mouse. When tumors became palpable, mice
were randomized into three groups (7 animals/group)
and animals received either vehicle, the association of
AZD6244 (10 mg/kg) and BEZ235 (20 mg/Kg) or of
PLX4720 (10 mg/Kg) and BEZ235 (20 mg/Kg), 5 days
per week for three consecutive weeks by oral gavage.
Mice were monitored daily for signs of toxicity and were
weighed twice weekly. Tumor size was regularly evaluated
by measuring the orthogonal diameters (d and D) and
calculating the volumes with the following formula: 4/3π
[(d2D)/2].

guidelines (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Silencing was
checked by Western blot analysis at 48 h and at 96 h. At
48 h after transfection with Bax siRNA smart pool, or with
negative control oligos, cells were treated with AZD6244
plus BEZ235 (0.1 μM + 0.1 μM), or with PLX4720 plus
BEZ235 (0.1 μM + 0.5 μM) and analyzed after 48 h by
staining for Annexin-V/Propidium Iodide or for active
caspase-3.

Melanoma apoptosis was assessed after staining
with APC-conjugated Annexin V (BD Pharmingen) and
propidium iodide (PI; BD Biosciences) as described [37–
38]. DNA content analysis was carried out after staining
with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) as described [37].
Staining with purified mouse Bax conformation-specific
antibody 6A7 or with rabbit FITC-anti-active caspase-3
antibody (BD Pharmingen) was carried out on cells
permeabilized with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD Pharmingen).
Secondary and control antibodies were, respectively,
FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch
Laboratories) and FITC-rabbit IgG isotype control. In
some experiments, melanoma cells were pre-incubated
with general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk or control
z-FA-fmk (BD Pharminge) at 5  μM for 1 h at 37°C before
treatment with drugs. All experiments were carried out
with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and
analyzed by the FlowJo software (Tree Star).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed with
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues as described
[40]. SCID mice bearing s.c. Me13 xenografts were
treated with AZD6244-BEZ25 or PLX4720-BEZ235
combinations as described for the tumor growth
inhibition assays. Neoplastic nodules were removed
after the last administration of inhibitors (day 31) and
were characterized by staining with antibodies to p-ERK
(Thr202/Tyr204, Cell Signaling), p-AKT (Ser473, Cell
Signaling), β catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories),
or cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling). The extent of
apoptosis in neoplastic nodules was evaluated by TUNEL
staining (Roche). Cytospin preparations of melanoma
cell lines were processed and stained for AXL (R & D
Systems) and for MITF (Dako) as described [43]. Images
were acquired at 20x with an Axiovert 100 microscope
(Zeiss) equipped with a digital camera (AxioCam MrC5,
Zeiss). For image acquisition, all main microscope and
digital camera operative settings, including exposure time,
were kept constant. Immunohistochemistry images were
quantified using ImageJ.

Cell death and caspase 3/7 activity assays by
Muse cell analyzer
In some experiments, apoptosis and caspase 3/7
activation were assessed by the Muse™ Cell Analyzer
(Merck Millipore). For apoptosis determination, cells were
collected and resuspended according to manufacturer’s
instructions with the working solution of the Muse™
Annexin V & Dead Cell Kit (Merck Millipore) for
20 minutes at room temperature. For caspase 3/7 activity
cells were collected, resuspended in 1X Assay Buffer BA,
and incubated with Muse™ Caspase-3/7 Assay Kit (Merck
Millipore) reagent working solution for 30 minutes in the
37°C incubator with 5% CO2. After incubation, Muse™
Caspase 7-AAD working solution was added for 5 minutes
at room temperature. Data were analyzed by Muse 1.4
Analysis Software.

IC50 values were clustered by Cluster 3.0 software
and clustering was visualized by Java TreeView.
Correlation of susceptibility profiles to different inhibitors
was tested by Spearman correlation analysis. Comparison
of IC50 values, of combination index (CI) values and
of fraction affected (FA) data, in different groups of
melanoma cell lines, was done by Kruskal-Wallis and
Dunn multiple comparison test. Analysis of FA values
by combinations of inhibitors in the same group of
melanoma cell lines, or in all cell lines, when equivalent
doses of different inhibitors were used, was carried out
by Wilcoxon matched pair test. Significance of different
treatments on melanoma apoptosis, caspase activation,
modulation of apoptosis-related molecules was assessed
by ANOVA, followed by Student-Newman-Keul (SNK)
multiple comparison test. Analysis of the antitumor
activity of different treatments in-vivo was carried out by
mixed effects model ANOVA [45] by XLSTAT software
(Xlstat).
