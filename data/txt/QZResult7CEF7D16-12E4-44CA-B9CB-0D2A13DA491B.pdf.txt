BACKGROUND. Effective treatment options are limited for patients with cutaneous
angiosarcoma (AS). Docetaxel, a member of the taxane family of drugs, reportedly
has been effective in the treatment of lung, head and neck, and breast cancers.
Another taxane drug, paclitaxel, reportedly had unique activity in the treatment of
AS of the scalp and neck and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related
Kaposi sarcoma. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that docetaxel may be of
value in the treatment of cutaneous AS that is resistant to conventional therapy.

However, there were only 3 case reports of the successful treatment of AS in elderly
patients using docetaxel in combination with surgery and radiotherapy.

METHODS. This was a retrospective trial. After written informed consent was
obtained, docetaxel was administered intravenously at a dose of 25 mg/m2 for
1 hour weekly over a period of 8 weeks on the basis of previous reports. This
treatment regimen was received by 9 patients with cutaneous AS who were treated at Kobe University Hospital between January 2003 and October 2006.

RESULTS. Six of the 9 patients who received treatment achieved major responses,
including 2 complete responses and 4 partial responses. Neutropenia and peripheral
neuropathy were not prominent, although severe radiation dermatitis enhanced by the
docetaxel was observed in 3 patients. There were no deaths attributable to this therapy.

CONCLUSIONS. The current study demonstrated that docetaxel was effective in patients
with cutaneous AS. Cancer 2007;110:648–51.  2007 American Cancer Society.

ngiosarcoma (AS) of the scalp is a rare disease for which there
has been no effective chemotherapy. Therefore, a combination of
resection with a wide and deep margin and radiation has been
recommended.1 However, the outcomes of such combination therapy
have been poor.2 In the 1990s, 2 taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel)
demonstrated good efficacy in patients with breast cancer.3,4 Paclitaxel has unique activity not only in breast cancer but also in AS5,6
and Kaposi sarcoma,7 and it has been demonstrated that paclitaxel is
effective in the treatment of AS. However, few patients who received
treatment with docetaxel have been reported.8–10 Therefore, we
reviewed our experience of chemotherapy in adult patients with cutaneous AS using docetaxel.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed the medical records of 9 patients with cutaneous AS
who received treatment with docetaxel at Kobe University Hospital
between January 2003 and October 2006. All patients provided

signed, written informed consent before chemotherapy. The review included 7 patients with AS of the
scalp and neck, 1 patient with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, and 1 patient with Stewart-Treves
syndrome of both legs after total hysterectomy. The
clinical characteristics of our patients are summarized in Table 1. The mean age was 72.7 years (range,
56–91 years). The patient with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma had multiple metastatic lung
tumors. Because of the severe nature of their disease,
8 of 9 patients previously or simultaneously had
received other therapies (surgery and/or irradiation
and/or immunotherapy with interleukin 2 [IL2]). In
Patients 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, we evaluated the effect of
the drug on the basis of measurements of the size
and greatest dimension of residual tumors after irradiation or surgery. In Patients 2, 3, and 4, the size of
metastatic (satellite) lesions outside of the radiation
therapy area also was evaluated. Because, in Patient
5, the lesion of malignant epithelioid hemangioendothelioma on the patient’s scalp was removed completely with surgery, we measured the number and
size of multiple lung metastases to evaluate the effect
of docetaxel.
Docetaxel (Taxotere; Sanofi-Aventis, Tokyo, Japan)
was administered intravenously at a dose of 25 mg/
m2 for 1 hour weekly over a period of 8 weeks. Docetaxel was given every week except for Weeks 4 and 8.
Thereafter, if the patient experienced stable disease
or a better response, then additional treatment was
administered. Patients were premedicated with dexamethasone (8 mg orally) for 3 days before chemotherapy, and 8 mg dexamethasone were administered
orally twice over the next 24 hours, as reported previously.11 Clinical evaluations were done after each
course of chemotherapy. In all patients, radiologic
evaluation consisted of computed tomography scans,

a magnetic resonance imaging, and, if necessary,
bone scintigraphy.
Responses were assessed according to the following definitions: A clinically complete response (CR)
was defined as the disappearance of all evidence of
measurable disease and assessable tumor for at least
1 month. A partial response (PR) was defined as a
decrease 50% in the sum of the products of greatest
perpendicular dimensions of all measurable lesions
that lasted for at least 1 month. Stable disease (SD)
was defined as a response less than a PR but with no
disease progression for at least 1 month. Progressive
disease (PD) was defined as any increase 25% in
the size of measurable lesions.

RESULTS
Response
Of the 9 patients who received docetaxel, 6 patients
had a major response (2 CRs and 4 PRs). Two
patients had SD, and 1 patient with Stewart-Treves
syndrome of both legs after total hysterectomy had
PD.
The observed response duration to docetaxel was
from 1 month to 22 months (average, 9.5 months).
Two patients (Patients 2 and 6) who achieved a CR
had primary lesions of the scalp. Although Patient 2
attained a CR for 22 months, he discontinued therapy with docetaxel for personal reasons. However, he
restarted docetaxel because of a local recurrence.
Docetaxel monotherapy also was effective for recurrent lesions. After Patient 2 achieved a CR for 9
months after restarting docetaxel, recurrent lesions
appeared on his cheek. Patient 6 achieved a CR for
14 months. In Patients 1 and 4, who achieved a PR
for 15 months and 3 months, respectively, local
recurrence occurred on the face, head, and neck.

The cause of death in Patient 1 was unclear; however, we could not find any clinical symptoms or
radiologic evidence of lung metastasis. In Patient 5
(the patient with epithelioid hemangioendothelioma), we evaluated the effect of docetaxel based on
the size of multiple lung metastases. The greatest
measurable dimensions of the metastases have not
changed for 16 months and have shown no local recurrence. In 5 of 9 patients, we administered paclitaxel weekly as second-line therapy. The patient with
Stewart-Treves syndrome achieved SD for 4 months
after the administration of paclitaxel, although the
docetaxel was ineffective.

Toxicity Evaluation
Docetaxel toxicity was assessed in all 9 patients.
Myelosuppression was not prominent; therefore,
granulocyte-colony stimulating factors or platelet
transfusions were not administrated for any patient
in this series. No neuropathy was observed. Patients
2, 3, and 4 were treated simultaneously with radiation therapy for their temporal areas. Docetaxel is
well known for its ability to enhance the effectiveness of irradiation in cutaneous and mucosal
tumors.12 These patients had severe radiation dermatitis on their cheeks and neck and had widespread
erosion and ulcers on their buccal mucosa, gingiva,
and tongue.

DISCUSSION
Angiosarcoma in the elderly is an aggressive neoplasm. Local recurrence and early metastasis to the
lung are not uncommon and are associated with a
poor prognosis.2 Although surgery, wide-field radiation, and systemic doxorubicin administration are
recommended, only 20% of patients are disease free
at 5 years.5 Recently, paclitaxel and docetaxel, members of the taxane family, have been used especially
in the treatment of breast cancer3,4 and lung cancer.4
However, in reports of studies conducted at the
Mayo clinic13 and in Europe,14 it was concluded that
docetaxel was rather ineffective in soft tissue sarcomas, including AS, and could not be recommended
for further use. Therefore, the application of docetaxel for AS was discontinued. In Japan, we started to
use docetaxel for AS in 2001, because it also proved
to be effective in the treatment of advanced-stage
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Kaposi
sarcoma.15 Based on the finding that the origin of
both Kaposi sarcoma and AS is the endothelial cell, it
is conceivable that the antiangiogenic activity of
paclitaxel and docetaxel is a mechanism that contributes to its efficacy in angiosarcoma.5 Recently, there

have been a few reports showing the efficacy of docetaxel for AS.8–10 In the current report, we describe
our experience of favorable clinical response in 6 of
9 patients who were treated with docetaxel.
The reasons for the discrepancy between the
results from the European study and our current
results are unclear. Although their protocol was different from ours, the number of patients with AS was
too small in the European study to determine which
protocol yielded a better outcome. In patients who
were treated with paclitaxel, Fata et al. reported that
1 patient, who had progressed on a 3-hour infusion
(every 3 weeks) of paclitaxel, experienced a CR when
switched to the weekly, low-dose schedule.5
In our current series, there were no withdrawals
because of safety concerns. The most severe side
effect experienced by our patients was radiation dermatitis on the scalp, neck, and oral mucosa. Although
local irradiation was indispensable in the treatment
for AS because of the enhanced effect of irradiation
by docetaxel, 3 of our patients had wide-spread dermatitis and erosion and had ulcerations of the skin
and oral mucosa, which disturbed their oral ingestion for 2 months.
Although the administration of a regular dose of
docetaxel (60–75 mg/m2) every 3 weeks often
induced neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy, we
adopted a weekly low-dose therapy (25 mg/m2) with
no severe side effects.15 In 5 of 9 patients, therapy
with docetaxel was discontinued and switched to
therapy with paclitaxel. At the beginning of chemotherapy (8 weeks) with paclitaxel, the drug seemed to
be an active chemotherapeutic agent in patients with
AS who had received previous treatment with docetaxel-based chemotherapy. However, several months
later, it appeared that AS became resistant to the
therapy with paclitaxel in all patients. Consistent
with a previous study,16 it is likely that the pattern of
prior response to docetaxel may determine the likelihood of disease response to paclitaxel. These 2
agents differ somewhat in their in vivo and in vitro
activities and in some cell lines and in some human
cancer specimens; and docetaxel has demonstrated a
greater ability to inhibit tumor cell growth compared
with paclitaxel.16 The sequence of drug administration has been worthy of study in cancer chemotherapy. Currently, which taxane is the optimal choice in
the treatment of AS as front-line therapy remains a
matter of controversy.
To date, except for Patient 1, we have observed
no clinical symptoms or radiologic evidence of lung
metastasis. It is noteworthy that docetaxel potently
may suppress lung metastasis of AS, which is the
most direct and frequent cause of death from AS.

In conclusion, docetaxel is an effective and safe
chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of patients
with cutaneous AS. However, as a caveat, we should
add that our study was not homogeneous, the number
of the patients was small, and some of these patients
may require follow-up therapy with paclitaxel. Which
drug can yield the best outcomes as initial therapy
remains unknown. Future clinical research should
explore the most appropriate regimens with docetaxel
in the treatment of cutaneous AS.
