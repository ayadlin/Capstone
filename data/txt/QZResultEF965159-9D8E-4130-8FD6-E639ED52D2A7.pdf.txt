Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and myofibroblasts are key drivers in cancer that are
associated with drug resistance in many cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC). However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which TAM and fibroblasts
contribute to chemoresistance is unclear. In this study, we found that TAM and myofibroblasts
directly support chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells by secreting insulin-like growth factors
(IGF) 1 and 2, which activate insulin/IGF receptors on pancreatic cancer cells.
Immunohistochemical analysis of biopsies from patients with pancreatic cancer revealed that 72%
of the patients expressed activated insulin/IGF receptors on tumor cells, and this positively
correlates with increased CD163+ TAM infiltration. In vivo, we found that TAM and
myofibroblasts were the main sources of IGF production, and pharmacologic blockade of IGF
sensitized pancreatic tumors to gemcitabine. These findings suggest that inhibition of IGF in
combination with chemotherapy could benefit patients with PDAC, and that insulin/IGF1R
activation may be used as a biomarker to identify patients for such therapeutic intervention.

Introduction

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Drug resistance is one of the biggest challenges in cancer therapeutics and the cause of
relapse in the majority of patients with cancer (1, 2). Therefore, understanding the molecular
mechanisms by which cancer cells become resistant to therapies is critical to the
development of durable treatment strategies. Mechanisms of resistance to therapies can be
tumor cell intrinsic or mediated by the tumor microenvironment (3). We previously
described intrinsic mechanisms of cancer cells' resistance to targeted therapy and
radiotherapy (4–6). However, multiple factors can contribute to resistance to therapy and
tumor progression, and one dominant player in solid cancers, and specifically in pancreatic
cancer, is the presence of a rich protumoral microenvironment (7–10). In the pancreatic
tumor microenvironment, macrophages and fibroblasts are the most abundant stromal cells,
and engage in bidirectional interactions with cancer cells. Although tumor-associated
macrophages (TAM) have the potential to kill cancer cells, we and others have shown that
TAMs can promote tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and also protect tumors from
cytotoxic agents (11–23). Indeed, TAMs can be polarized into M1-like inflammatory
macrophages that will activate an immune response against the tumor, or into M2-like
immunosuppressive macrophages that promote tumor immunity and tumor progression (7,
24–26). Thus, therapeutics that can reprogram TAMs into M1-like macrophages or that
specifically inhibit the protumoral functions of M2-like macrophages, rather than
macrophage ablation therapies, may be more effective in the goal of restraining cancer
progression (27, 28). However, the understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms by
which TAMs and CAFs support tumor progression, and the use of combination therapies
simultaneously targeting both protumoral stromal cells and cancer cells is only beginning to
emerge.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease, with one of the worst
survival rates, and current standard therapies are unfortunately not very effective (29, 30). A
characteristic feature of PDAC is an excessive tumor microenvironment with infiltrated
immune cells that include macrophages (TAMs), and high numbers of activated fibroblasts,
also known as myofibroblasts (31–33). In these studies, we sought to gain a better

understanding of the mechanism(s) by which TAMs and myofibroblasts support resistance
of pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapy with the aim to find innovative treatment
combinations using conventional cytotoxic agents with therapies targeting the
protumorigenic functions of stromal cells.

Materials and Methods
Generation of primary KPC-derived pancreatic cancer cells
The murine pancreatic cancer cells KPC FC1242 were generated in the Tuveson lab (Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory) isolated from PDAC tumor tissues obtained from LSL-KrasG12D;
LSL-Trp53R172H; Pdx1-Cre mice of a pure C57BL/6 background as described previously
with minor modifications (34). KPC cells were isolated in our laboratory from PDAC tumor
tissues obtained from LSL-KrasG12D; LSL-Trp53R172H; Pdx1-Cre mice in the mixed 129/
SvJae/C57Bl/6 background as described previously (for more details, see Supplementary
Data; ref. 35).
Cell lines
SUIT-2 and MIA-PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cell lines were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, at 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.
SUIT-2 cells were obtained in 2012 and MIA-PaCa-2 cells in 2010, and both were last
authenticated by Eurofins in June 2016, and periodically tested and resulted negative for
mycoplasma contamination.
Generation of primary macrophages, primary pancreatic myofibroblasts, macrophage, and
myofibroblasts conditioned media

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Primary murine macrophages were generated by flushing the bone marrow from the femur
and tibia of C57BL/6 or mixed 129/SvJae/C57Bl/6 (PC) mice followed by incubation for 5
days in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 ng/mL murine M-CSF (PeproTech). Primary
human macrophages were generated by purifying CD14+ monocytes from blood samples
obtained from healthy subjects using magnetic bead affinity chromatography according to
manufacturer's directions (Miltenyi Biotec) followed by incubation for 5 days in DMEM
containing 10% FBS and 50 ng/mL recombinant human M-CSF (PeproTech). Primary
pancreatic stellate cells were isolated from C57BL/6 mice pancreas by density gradient
centrifugation, and were activated into myofibroblasts by culturing them on uncoated plastic
dishes in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium with 10% FBS.
To generate macrophage (MCM) and myofibroblasts conditioned media (MyoCM), cells
were cultured in serum-free media for 24 to 36 hours, supernatant was harvested, filtered
with 0.45-μm filter, concentrated using StrataClean Resin (Agilent Technologies), and
immunoblotted for insulin-like growth factors (IGF) 1 and IGF2 (Abcam), or stored at
−20°C.
Treatment with chemotherapy, MCM, blocking antibodies, and recombinant IGF
SUIT-2, MIA-PaCa-2, and KPC-derived cells were cultured in DMEM with 2% FBS for 24
hours, pretreated for 3 hours with MCM, or MyoCM, recombinant IGF (PeproTech 100-11)

RTK arrays and immunoblotting
Cells were serum starved or treated with MCM for 30 minutes or 3 hours, harvested, and
lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton
X-100, 5 mmol/L EDTA) supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma),
a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Invitrogen), 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsufonylfluoride and
0.2 mmol/L Na3VO4. Cell lysates were analyzed with the Phospho-RTK Array Kit (R&D
Systems). Immunoblotting analyses were performed using antibodies listed in
Supplementary Data.
Syngeneic orthotopic pancreatic cancer models
Two orthotopic syngeneic pancreatic cancer models and two IGF-blocking antibodies were
used in these studies. In one model, 1 × 106 primary KPCluc/zsGreen (zsGreen) cells
(FC1242luc/zsGreen) isolated from a pure C57Bl/6 background were implanted into the
pancreas of immunocompetent syngeneic C57Bl/6 six- to 8-week-old female mice, and
tumors were established for one week before beginning treatment. Mice were administered
intraperitoneally with gemcitabine (100 mg/kg), IGF-blocking antibody BI 836845 (100
mg/kg; ref. 36) kindly provided by Boehringer Ingelheim, or IgG isotype control antibody,
every 2–3 days for 10–15 days before harvest. The second model is described in
Supplementary Data.

Total RNA was isolated from purified cells as described for Qiagen RNeasy protocol. Total
RNA from entire pancreatic tumor tissues was extracted using a high salt lysis buffer
(guanidine thiocynate 5 mol/L, sodium citrate 2.5 μmol/L, lauryl sarcosine 0.5% in H2O) to
improve RNA quality followed by purification using Qiagen RNeasy protocol. cDNA was
prepared from 1 μg RNA per sample, and qPCR was performed using gene-specific
QuantiTect Primer Assay primers from Qiagen. Relative expression levels were normalized
to gapdh expression according to the formula <2−(Ctgene of interest −Ctgapdh) (37).
Analysis and quantification of immune cells in pancreatic tumors by flow cytometry
Single-cell suspensions from murine pancreatic tumors were prepared by mechanical and
enzymatic disruption in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution with 1 mg/mL Collagenase P (Roche;

Results
Macrophage-derived IGFs activate insulin and IGF1 receptors signaling in pancreatic
cancer cells and induce chemoresistance
We and others have previously shown that inhibition of myeloid cell infiltration into tumors
restrains cancer progression and increases response to chemotherapy (12, 14, 15, 18–22).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which macrophages
modulate pancreatic cancer cells' response to chemotherapy, we cultured human and mouse
pancreatic cancer cells with MCM from primary human and mouse macrophages in the
presence or absence of the standard chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine. Primary human
and mouse macrophages were generated using macrophage colony stimulating factor 1 (MCSF1), which favors an M2-like phenotype (38), which was further confirmed by high
expression of CD206 (M2 macrophage marker) and lack of IL12 (M1 macrophage marker;
Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). We found, that MCM can directly induce
chemoresistance of human and mouse pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine (Fig. 1A).
Mechanistically, a phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array of pancreatic cancer cells cultured
in the presence or absence of MCM revealed that MCM induces the phosphorylation and
activation of three receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), insulin receptor (number 1), AXL
receptor (number 2) and Ephrin receptor (number 3) (Fig. 1B). Insulin/IGF1 receptor
signaling is known to be involved in drug resistance in various cancers (39). However, a
direct role for macrophages in chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer via macrophagedependent activation of the Insulin and IGF1 receptors has so far never been described.
Thus, in this report, we further focused on investigating the role of insulin/IGF1 receptor
activation by macrophages in pancreatic cancer chemoresistance. Activation of insulin and
IGF1 receptors by macrophages was further confirmed by immunoblotting analysis (Fig.
1C) and by detection of tyrosine phosphorylation on insulin and IGF1 receptors
immunoprecipitated from SUIT-2 human pancreatic cancer cells cultured in the presence or
absence of MCM (Fig. 1D). Insulin and IGF1 receptors can bind three ligands: insulin,
IGF-1, and IGF-2 (40). We found that primary human and mouse macrophages express
mRNA levels of Igf-1 and Igf-2 but not Insulin (Fig. 1E and F and Supplementary Fig. S1C
and S1D). We also found IGF1 and IGF2 proteins in primary human and mouse MCM and
macrophage lysates (Fig. 1G). However, we could hardly detect any expression of IGFs nor
insulin in pancreatic cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S1E). Thus, these findings suggest
that activation of insulin and IGF1 receptors on pancreatic cancer cells is triggered through
paracrine macrophage-derived IGF1/IGF2 signaling. Interestingly, alternatively (IL4)
activated M2 macrophages expressed higher levels of IGFs compared with classically
(IFNγ/LPS) activated M1 macrophages (Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D).

pancreatic cancer cells stimulated with MCM revealed that MCM activates insulin/IGF1R
signaling to a similar degree as recombinant IGF (Fig. 1H). Importantly, blockade of IGF
ligands with an IGF-neutralizing antibody was able to prevent macrophage-dependent
activation of insulin/IGF1 receptors and the downstream effectors IRS1, IRS2, and AKT
(Fig. 2A), and to inhibit macrophage-induced chemoresistance of human and mouse
pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine (Fig. 2B–D). In addition, recombinant IGF was
sufficient to mediate resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapy, in a similar way
to MCM (Fig. 2C– F). In the absence of chemotherapy, treatment of tumor cells with MCM,
IGF-blocking antibody, or recombinant IGF alone did not alter the survival or proliferation
of cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). In vitro exposure of pancreatic cancer
cells to MCM was also able to enhance resistance of cancer cells to paclitaxel and 5fluorouracil (5-FU) (Supplementary Fig. S3A– S3C). These findings suggest an important
role for macrophage-derived IGFs in activating the insulin/IGF1 receptor survival signaling
pathway in pancreatic cancer cells, and in enhancing resistance to chemotherapy.
Insulin and IGF receptors are activated on tumor cells in biopsies from pancreatic cancer
patients, and this positively correlates with increased TAMs

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We next evaluated whether the insulin/IGF1 receptor signaling is activated in biopsies from
patients with pancreatic cancer, and whether this correlates with increased macrophage
infiltration. Immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining of phospho-insulin and
phospho-IGF1 receptors in biopsies from patients with PDAC revealed that insulin/IGF1R
signaling is activated in pancreatic cancer cells in 38 of 53 (~72%) consented patients (Fig.
3A–C and Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Similarly,
immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining of CD68 (pan-myeloid/macrophage
marker) and CD163 (macrophage marker, commonly used to identify M2-like macrophages
in human tissues) in the same frozen and paraffinembedded human PDAC samples showed
that pancreatic tumors are infiltrated by CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages, which surround
the phospho-insulin/IGF1R+ ductal epithelial pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 3D and
Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D). As we observed that M2-like macrophages express IGF
ligands (Fig. 1E–G and Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D), we subsequently analyzed, by
IHC, serial sections from patients with PDAC for the copresence of CD163+ (M2-like)
macrophages and phospho-insulin/IGF1R+ tumor cells. Importantly, we found that activation
of insulin/IGF1 receptors positively correlates with increased infiltration of CD163+ (M2like) macrophages (Fig. 3E and F; Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Immunofluorescent
costaining of TAMs and IGFs confirmed that, in PDAC patient samples, TAMs express both
IGF1 and IGF2 (Fig. 3G).
TAMs and myofibroblasts are the main sources of IGFs in the pancreatic tumor
microenvironment
To determine whether TAMs are the main source of IGFs within the pancreatic tumor
microenvironment, we orthotopically implanted murine primary pancreatic cancer cells
derived from the genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer (LSL-KrasG12D;
LSL-Trp53R172H; Pdx1-Cre mice; KPC) into syngeneic immunocompetent recipient mice.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), immunohistochemical, and immunofluorescent stainings
with CD68, CD206, and αSMA, and flow cytometry analysis of these tumors, showed that

these mice developed PDAC, and that similar to human PDAC, these tumors are infiltrated
by immune cells, including macrophages (Fig. 4A and B and Supplementary Fig. S5A), and
are rich in αSMA+ myofibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B; refs. 32, 41–43).
Importantly, murine PDAC orthotopic tumors also showed phosphorylation of insulin/
IGF1R on tumor cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, similar to the orthotopically implanted PDAC
tumors, spontaneous PDAC tumors derived from the genetically engineered KPC model also
showed activation of insulin/IGF1R on tumor cells surrounded by CD206+ TAMs and
αSMA+ myofibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S6).
To determine whether in vivo, pancreatic TAMs are the main source of IGFs, we isolated
TAMs (F4/80+ cells) from established orthotopic PDAC tumors and assessed the expression
levels of Igf-1 and Igf-2. In agreement with our previous findings (Figs. 1E and F and 3G),
we found that intratumoral macrophages isolated from murine pancreatic tumors express
higher levels of Igf-1 and Igf-2 compared with F4/80− cells (Fig. 4C).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To further investigate this, we used a second KPC-derived cell line (FC1242) stably labeled
with zsGreen reporter gene. As previously described, KPC-derived zsGreen cells were
orthotopically implanted into the pancreas of syngeneic recipient mice (Fig. 4D). Tumors
were harvested at day 23, and tumor cells (CD45−/zsGreen+), nonimmune stromal cells
(CD45−/zsGreen−), M1-like macrophages (CD45+/F4/80+/CD206−) and M2-like
macrophages (CD45+/F4/80+/CD206+) were sorted by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig.
S7A) and analyzed for the expression of Igf-1 and Igf-2. This model further confirmed that
orthotopic pancreatic tumors are infiltrated by both CD206+ (M2-like) and CD206− (M1like) TAMs (Fig. 4E) and revealed that both CD206+ (M2-like macrophages) and αSMA+
stromal cells, also known as myofibroblasts, are the main sources of IGFs in pancreatic
tumors (Fig. 4F and Supplementary Fig. S7B). The ability of pancreatic myofibroblasts to
produce IGFs was further assessed ex vivo in myofibroblasts and MyoCM (Supplementary
Fig. S8A–S8C), as well as their capacity to enhance the resistance of tumor cells to
chemotherapy (Supplementary Fig. S8D). Similarly, Tape and colleagues, recently found,
using a proteomic approach, that in vitro, fibroblasts exposed to KPC-derived cells produce
IGF, which promotes proliferation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells (44). In agreement
with these findings, we also found high levels of IGF1 and IGF2 proteins in areas that are
rich in macrophages and myofibroblasts in biopsies from patients with PDAC
(Supplementary Fig. S9).
Blockade of IGFs improves response to gemcitabine in a preclinical tumor model of
pancreatic cancer
Macrophages and myofibroblasts are the most abundant non-malignant stromal cells within
the tumor microenvironment in PDAC (33). As we found that TAMs and myofibroblasts
express IGFs in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment and stromal-derived IGFs enhance
the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapy in vitro, we hypothesize that
inhibition of IGFs could increase pancreatic cancer response to chemotherapy in vivo.
To test this hypothesis, we treated mice bearing established orthotopic pancreatic tumors
with control IgG antibody, gemcitabine alone, IGF-blocking antibody (BI 836845) alone, or
gemcitabine combined with BI 836845 (Fig. 5A). As previously shown (22, 32, 41, 43), and

similar to what is observed in patients with PDAC, gemcitabine alone had little or no effect
on tumor growth in this model (Fig. 5B). Treatment with BI 836845 IGF-blocking antibody
alone, only showed a modest effect on tumor growth. In contrast, combination of
gemcitabine with BI 836845 significantly reduced tumor growth (Fig. 5B). Analysis of
immune cell populations within the different treatment groups showed an increase in F4/80+
macrophages in gemcitabine and gemcitabine+ BI 836845–treated tumors (Fig. 5C and
Supplementary Fig. S10); however, the ratio of CD206− (M1-like) and CD206+ (M2-like)
macrophages within tumors remained the same in all treatment groups (Fig. 5D). In
addition, the percentage of inflammatory monocytes (Ly6C+Ly6G−CD11b+F4/80−),
neutrophils/myeloid-derived suppressor cells (Gr1+ CD11b+F4/80−), and cytotoxic CD8+ T
lymphocytes (CD3+CD8+; CTL) remained similar in all treatment groups (Fig. 5C).
Immunohistochemical analysis of tumors showed that phosphorylation of insulin and IGF1
receptors was decreased in tumors treated with BI 836845 IGF-blocking antibody (Fig. 5E
and Supplementary Fig. S11). Importantly, immunohistochemical staining of cleaved
caspase-3 revealed significantly higher levels of cell death in tumors treated with the
combination of gemcitabine and BI 836845, compared with control, gemcitabine alone, or
BI 836845 alone groups (Fig. 5E and F).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To confirm these results, we repeated a similar experiment using a second KPC-derived cell
line, and a commercially available IGF-blocking antibody from Abcam (ab9572). This
second in vivo experiment yielded very similar results, and showed a significant decrease in
tumor growth in mice treated with the combination of gemcitabine/IGF-blocking antibody
(Fig. 6A and B), a decrease in insulin and IGF1 receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 6C and
Supplementary Fig. S11), and a strong increase in cleaved caspase-3 levels in tumors
cotreated with gemcitabine and IGF-blocking antibody (Fig. 6C). Combination of 5-FU or
paclitaxel with BI 836845 only produced a slight decrease in tumor growth in this model
(Supplementary Fig. S12A and S12B), despite an increase in tumor cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S12C and S12D).
Taken together, these findings indicate that functional blockade of IGFs significantly
increases the response of pancreatic tumors to gemcitabine in vivo.

Discussion
The data presented herein describe that stromal-derived IGFs are a critical inducer of
chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer, and provide preclinical data that support the rationale
for using IGF-blocking antibodies in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of
pancreatic cancer (Fig. 6D). In these studies, we report a direct role for TAMs and
myofibroblasts in chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells, and a paracrine signaling loop
in which stromal-derived IGFs activate the insulin/IGF1R survival signaling pathway and
blunt response of pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapy. A recent study describes how
fibroblasts exposed to pancreatic cancer cells secrete IGF, and this leads to pancreatic cancer
cell survival and proliferation in vitro (44). In agreement with these findings, in this study,
we further confirm that production of IGF by stromal cells occurs in pancreatic tumors in
vivo and that both macrophages and myofibroblasts are the two major sources of IGFs
within the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. In addition, we found that in humans, the

insulin/IGF1R signaling pathway is activated in 38 of 53 (~72%) of PDAC patient samples,
and this strongly positively correlates with an increase in CD163+ (M2-like) TAMs.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

On the basis of these findings, we explored the therapeutic opportunities of combining
gemcitabine with IGF inhibition in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer, and found that
indeed, inhibition of IGFs signaling increases response of pancreatic tumors to gemcitabine.
While IGF receptor inhibitors failed in the clinics (41, 45–47), two IGF-blocking antibodies,
MEDI-573 and BI 836845, are being evaluated in phase II clinical trials for metastatic breast
cancer (MEDI-573), and metastatic breast cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer (BI
836845; Clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers: NCT02204072, NCT01446159, NCT02123823). In
contrast to IGF1 receptor inhibitors, which only inhibit signaling through IGF1 receptor,
IGF ligand–blocking antibodies inhibit proliferative (but not metabolic) signaling through
both IGF1 and insulin receptors. The studies described here provide the proof-of-principle
for further evaluation of IGF-blocking antibodies in combination with gemcitabine for the
treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.
Despite extensive efforts invested in the clinical development of therapies against PDAC,
current standard treatments only exert a modest effect, and targeting only the tumor cells has
not resulted in a significant improvement in patient outcome (30, 31). The rich stromal
compartment present in PDAC is not inert, and instead provides a variety of nonmalignant
stromal cells and extracellular matrix proteins, which support tumor initiation, progression,
and drug resistance (11, 20, 22, 23, 32, 35, 41, 42). Thus, therapies that target both the
neoplastic cells and the protumorigenic functions of the stromal compartment will likely
achieve a better therapeutic response.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

TAMs can enhance or limit the efficacy of chemotherapy depending on the tumor model, the
tumor stage and/or the chemotherapeutic agent used. For example, chemoresistance is
increased when cytotoxic agents increase M2-like macrophage infiltration via CCL2 (48) or
CSF1 (21). Macrophages can also impair host responses to chemotherapy by expressing
cathepsins that activate chemoprotective T cells (18, 19) or by inducing the upregulation of
cytidine deaminase, an enzyme that metabolizes nucleoside analogues (20). TAMs
demonstrate a high degree of plasticity, and can be polarized into M1-like antitumorigenic
and M2-like protumorigenic macrophages (49). Previous studies targeting signaling
pathways necessary for the recruitment of macrophages or specific chemotactic factors
(CCL2/PI3Kγ/CSF1) have provided proof-of-concept that macrophages represent an
attractive target to reduce tumor progression (13, 14, 21, 22, 41, 50). However, dependent on
the microenvironmental cytokine milieu, macrophages are not only promoting tumor growth,
but they can also critically orchestrate an antitumor immune response (9). Thus, therapies
that aim to specifically inhibit the protumorigenic functions of macrophages, while sparing
their tumoricidal activity, could act as an alternative, and perhaps, more efficient approach
than therapies that completely block macrophage recruitment to the tumor (27, 28). In this
regard, our studies indicate that IGF blockade increases pancreatic tumors' response to
gemcitabine without affecting immune cell infiltration, including macrophage infiltration, or
without affecting macrophage polarization. Interestingly, a recent elegant study also

describes macrophage-derived IGF as a key driver of resistance to CSF-1R inhibition in
glioblastoma (51).

In conclusion, our studies suggest that in PDAC, stroma-derived IGFs can blunt the response
to chemotherapy via an IGF-insulin/IGF1R paracrine signaling axis, and provide the
rationale for further evaluating the combination of gemcitabine with IGF signaling blockade
in pancreatic cancer treatment.
