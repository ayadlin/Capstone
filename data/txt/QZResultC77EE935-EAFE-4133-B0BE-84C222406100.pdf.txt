Abstract
Most cancer cells utilize aerobic glycolysis, and activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR
pathway can promote this metabolic program to render cells glucose dependent. Although manipulation of
glucose metabolism may provide a means to specifically eliminate cancer cells, mechanistic links between cell
metabolism and apoptosis remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the role and metabolic regulation of
the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 in cell death upon inhibition of Akt-induced aerobic glycolysis. In
the presence of adequate glucose, activated Akt prevented the loss of Mcl-1 expression and protected cells from
growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis. Mcl-1 associated with and inhibited the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family
protein Bim, contributing to cell survival. However, suppression of glucose metabolism led to induction of Bim,
decreased expression of Mcl-1, and apoptosis. The proapoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Bcl-w inhibitor, ABT-737, shows
clinical promise, but Mcl-1 upregulation can promote resistance. Importantly, inhibition of glucose metabolism
or mTORC1 overcame Mcl-1–mediated resistance in diffuse large B cell leukemic cells. Together these data show
that Mcl-1 protein synthesis is tightly controlled by metabolism and that manipulation of glucose metabolism
may provide a mechanism to suppress Mcl-1 expression and sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Many cancer cells have increased rates of glucose uptake
and glycolysis relative to their normal counterparts, a metabolic program termed aerobic glycolysis (1, 2) that has allowed
detection and imaging of tumors and metastases by 18Fdeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (3). This metabolic program is believed to promote biosynthesis for rapid
cell growth and inhibit some cell death pathways (4, 5). In
particular, we have shown that elevated glycolysis characteristic of cancer cells can affect Bcl-2 family proteins to suppress
induction of the proapoptotic protein Puma and degradation
of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 (6–9). Because cancer cells
often rely on glucose as a biosynthetic and energy source,

disruption of aerobic glycolysis may provide an efficient
means to selectively target and eliminate cancer cells.
Bcl-2 family proteins are likely critical to effectively induce
apoptosis in new metabolic approaches to cancer therapy, as
inhibition of glucose metabolism requires Bcl-2 family proteins
to initiate rapid apoptosis. Cells lacking the proapoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins Bax and Bak resist cell death for prolonged
periods of nutrient starvation through activation of autophagy
and use of alternate fuels (10). In addition, the Bcl-2 family
includes antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl1, and proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, including Puma and
Bim (11), and expression of antiapoptotic family members can
protect cells from apoptosis upon glucose deprivation (8, 12). In
addition, we have previously shown that glucose deprivation
can lead to induction of Bim and a p53-dependent increase in
Puma expression that contributes to apoptosis (8, 9).
Among Bcl-2 family proteins, Mcl-1 may play a particularly
important role in cell death responses to changes in glucose
metabolism (7, 13, 14). Mcl-1 was first identified in a myeloid
cell leukemia cell line (15) and is overexpressed in many
cancers, including B- and T-cell malignancies (16). In contrast,
genetic deletion of Mcl-1 can cause embryonic lethality (17),
impede lymphocyte survival (18, 19), and sensitize cancer cells
to treatment with other agents (20–22). Synthesis of Mcl-1 is
regulated through transcriptional mechanisms induced by
cytokines including interleukin (IL)-2, -3, and -7, as well as
by control of protein translation through mTOR (14, 23). When
translated, Mcl-1 is a short-lived protein that is subject to

Metabolic Control of Mcl-1 and ABT-737 Resistance

rapid degradation after phosphorylation through ubiquitindependent (24–27) and ubiquitin-independent pathways (28).
We have previously shown that the oncogenic kinase Akt
promotes glucose metabolism and requires glucose in part to
regulate Bcl-2 family proteins to prevent cell death (4, 9). Here,
we examine the role of glucose metabolism in cells with active
Akt and show that inhibition of glucose metabolism leads to a
decrease in Mcl-1 protein expression that greatly sensitizes
cells to ABT-737, a BH3 mimetic that functions by binding to
and inhibiting the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and
Bcl-w, but not Mcl-1 or A1 (29). These results suggest that
cancer cell glucose metabolism is essential to maintain mTOR
and 4EBP1 phosphorylation to sustain Mcl-1 protein translation and that therapies directed at aerobic glycolysis may
allow selective reduction of Mcl-1 to sensitize cancer cells to
apoptosis to ABT-737.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Control, myristoylated Akt (mAkt), mAkt þ p70 S6K1 E389D3E (mAkt þ CA-S6K1), and Bcl-xL expressing FL5.12 cells
were cultured as described (7, 12) and washed 3 with PBS
followed by culture  IL-3. mAkt was induced by 16- to 24hours treatment with 1 mg/mL doxycycline (Sigma). Jurkat
cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in
RPMI 1640 media with 10% FBS. Murine primary T cells were
isolated by negative selection (StemSep) and stimulated on
anti-CD3e and anti-CD28–coated plates (BD Pharmingen) in
RPMI 1640 media with 10% FBS and 5 ng/mL IL-2 (PeproTech). After 48 hours, T cells were washed and cultured for an
additional 24 hours with IL-2. DHL4 Par, DHL4 R2, Ly.1 Par,
Ly.1 R7, and Ly.1 R10 cells were provided by Dr. A. Letai (Dana
Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; ref.20). DHL4 cells were
cultured in Iscoves Modified Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's
medium media (Mediatech) with 10% FBS. Ly.1 cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 media with 10% FBS. Glucose starvation was accomplished by washing 3 with PBS and culture in
glucose-free RPMI 1640 media (Gibco) with 10% dialyzed FBS
(Gemini BioProducts). 2-Deoxyglucose (2DG; Sigma), cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma), PP242 (Sigma), rapamycin (Cell Signaling), and ABT-737 (Abbott Laboratories) were added at
indicated doses.
Immunoblots
Cell lysates were prepared as described (8). Primary antibodies used were the following: Mcl-1 (BioLegend), Bim (BD
Pharmingen), Actin (Sigma), Puma (Cell Signaling), P-S6K
(Thr421/Ser424; Cell Signaling), P-S6 (Ser235/236; Cell Signaling), S6 (Cell Signaling), P-4EBP1 (Thr31/46; Cell Signaling),
4EBP1 (Cell Signaling), P-Akt (Ser473, Cell Signaling), Akt (Cell
Signaling), P-GSK3 (Ser9/21; Cell Signaling), and A1 (Cell
Signaling). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit (BD Pharmingen) and fluorescentlabeled anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) and anti-mouse (LiCor) antibodies. Blots were visualized by using Supersignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) or the Odyssey infrared imagining system (LiCor). Images were uniformly

contrasted and some were digitally reorganized to ease interpretation (indicated by white spaces).
Immunopreciptations
Cells were harvested in 1% CHAPS buffer with protease (BD
Pharmingen) and phosphatase (Sigma) inhibitors. Anti–Mcl-1
antibody (BioLegend) was added to equal protein amounts
and precipitated with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz) in 1%
CHAPS buffer.
Cell death analysis
Cells were stained with 1 mg/mL propidium iodide (PI;
Invitrogen), and 5,000 cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) in triplicate and analyzed with
FlowJo software (TreeStar).
Quantitative real-time PCR
RNA was harvested by using TRizol solution (Invitrogen)
and reverse transcribed with SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) for
quantitative real-time PCR with IQ SYBR Green Supermix
(BioRad) and b2-microglobulin (8) and Mcl-1 primers
(GCATGCTCCGGAAACTGGACATTA and ACGTGGAAGAACTCCACAAACCCA).
Transfection and plasmids
Transient transfections were conducted by nucleofection
(Amaxa Kit V; Lonza). Bim, Mcl-1, and control short hairpin
RNA interference (shRNAi) constructs have been described
(7). FLAG-tagged mouse Bim in the pEF6 vector was used for
Bim overexpression.
Mcl-1 synthesis
Control and/or mAkt expressing FL5.12 cells were cultured
for 8 hours as indicated, washed, and cultured in cysteine and
methionine-free RPMI 1640 media (Mediatech) for 30 minutes.
35
S-labeled cysteine and methionine (Perkin Elmer) were added,
cells were harvested at the indicated times. Mcl-1 was immunoprecipitated, and synthesis rate was determined by using the
following formula: t1/2 ¼ LN(2)/slope of 35S incorporation.
Metabolic measurements
ATP levels were determined by using the ATP bioluminescence assay Kit CLS II (Roche Applied Science). Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR)
were measured in real-time by using an XF24 extracellular flux
analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) as previously described (30).
Statistical analyses
Statistical significance was determined by Student's t-test
with P values as indicated with an asterisk.

Results
Active Akt must maintain Mcl-1 in a glucose-dependent
fashion to suppress Bim-induced cell death after IL-3
deprivation
Constitutive Akt activation occurs in many cancers to
promote aerobic glycolysis and glucose-dependent cell

survival (4, 12). Because Mcl-1 and Bim are known to play
prominent roles in hematopoietic cell survival (18, 19, 31), we
hypothesized that these proteins may be subject to metabolic
regulation in Akt-mediated cell survival. Expression of either
mAkt or Bcl-xL prevented cell death after IL-3 withdrawal of
FL5.12 cells, but only mAkt required glucose for survival
(Fig. 1A; refs. 9, 12). To assess possible regulation of Bcl-2
family members by Akt-dependent glucose metabolism and to
avoid changes in Mcl-1 and Bim as a consequence of apoptosis
itself (32), we examined Mcl-1 and Bim in cells expressing BclxL or mAkt. In Bcl-xL expressing cells, growth factor or
glucose deprivation each led to decreased Mcl-1 expression
and induction of Bim, particularly in the absence of IL-3
(Fig. 1B). In mAkt expressing cells, Bim was induced upon
limitation of either growth factor or glucose. In contrast,
although activated Akt maintained Mcl-1 expression upon
IL-3 withdrawal, Mcl-1 levels decreased when glucose was
withdrawn. This was not because of decreased Akt signaling,
as both Akt and the Akt substrate GSK-3 remained phosphorylated in the absence of glucose (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Decreased Mcl-1 expression upon disruption of
glucose metabolism appeared specific among antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins, as glucose deprivation did not affect
expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Importantly, the glucose-dependent ability of mAkt to
maintain Mcl-1 expression was essential for maximal Aktmediated survival. Partial reduction of Mcl-1 expression by
shRNAi was sufficient to reduce survival of mAkt expressing
cells relative to Bcl-xL expressing cells that resist apoptosis
and to more closely resemble control FL5.12 cells that undergo
rapid cell death after IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 1C and D, and
Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). Dependence on Mcl-1 was not
because of a specific unique function of Mcl-1, as overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL fully rescued the
survival of IL-3–deprived cells with reduced Mcl-1. Rather,
the specific metabolic regulation of Mcl-1 provided antiapop-

totic function that could not be replaced by endogenous Bcl-2
or Bcl-xL expression.
Mcl-1 is required for viability of hematopoietic cells in vivo
(18, 19), and decreased Mcl-1 may have allowed apoptosis
induced by Bim or other proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (9,
13). To test the role of Bim in the death of mAkt expressing
cells with reduced Mcl-1, expression of Bim and Mcl-1 was
reduced by shRNAi in IL-3 deprived mAkt expressing cells
(Fig. 2A). Bim deficiency partially rescued the increased
apoptosis observed in IL-3–deprived mAkt expressing cells
with reduced Mcl-1 (Fig. 2B). Conversely, transfection of
control cells with Bim led to rapid toxicity (Fig. 2C and D).
mAkt and Bcl-xL could each partially suppress Bim-induced
apoptosis, but mAkt expressing cells failed to do so when Mcl1 levels were reduced by shRNAi. These data suggested a
functional relationship between Mcl-1 and Bim, and coimmunoprecipitation with an anti-Mcl-1 antibody revealed
increased Bim binding to Mcl-1 after IL-3 withdrawal
(Fig. 2E). Therefore, Mcl-1 expression is required to suppress
apoptosis induced by Bim and other Bcl-2 family members (5,
8) upon disruption of glycolysis.
Inhibition of glucose metabolism causes decreased Mcl1 expression and cell death in multiple settings
Because glucose can be exhausted in inflamed tissues or
tumors (33), glucose availability may act as a rheostat to
control Mcl-1 expression and cell death. To examine the
metabolic effects of glucose depletion, control, mAkt, and
Bcl-xL expressing cells were cultured in the presence or
absence of glucose for 12 hours, and ATP and metabolic flux
were analyzed. Despite the availability of alternative fuel
sources, glucose deprivation decreased ATP levels in control
and mAkt expressing cells (Fig. 3A). ATP also decreased,
although to a lesser extent in cells expressing Bcl-xL, suggesting these cells had more robust capacity for metabolic
adaptation. As expected, glucose deprivation decreased the

ECAR, a measurement indicative of glycolytic rate (Fig. 3B).
Surprisingly, in no case did cells increase their OCR after 12
hours of glucose deprivation (Fig. 3C). Thus, glucose deprivation for extended periods led to decreased ATP and
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism did not increase to
compensate.
To more closely examine glucose metabolism and Mcl-1,
control FL5.12 cells were cultured either in limiting doses of
glucose or in the presence of glucose and the glycolytic
inhibitor 2DG. Complete glucose deprivation caused decreased
Mcl-1 expression (Fig. 4A) and rapid cell death (Fig. 4B). As little
as 0.1 mmol/L glucose protected Mcl-1 and prevented cell
death at early time points, although Mcl-1 decreased and cells
underwent apoptosis at later times. Addition of 2DG to inhibit
glycolysis also led to a dose-dependent loss of Mcl-1 expression
and cell viability (Fig. 4C and D). Lower Mcl-1 expression was
not a result of cell death, as glucose deprivation of Bcl-xL
expressing FL5.12 cells that resisted cell death (Fig. 1A; refs. 8,
12) also showed decreased Mcl-1 expression following glucose
withdrawal (Fig. 4E). In addition, glucose deprivation of

www.aacrjournals.org

both the T-ALL cell line Jurkat (Fig. 4F) as well as stimulated
primary murine T cells (Fig. 4G) also caused decreased Mcl-1
expression.
Glucose metabolism is essential to maintain Mcl-1
protein synthesis
Mcl-1 is frequently regulated at the level of protein stability
(7, 24-26). To determine if Akt maintained Mcl-1 levels by
glucose-dependent suppression of proteolytic degradation,
mAkt expressing FL5.12 cells were cultured in the absence
of IL-3 and the presence and absence of glucose followed by
treatment with CHX to inhibit new protein synthesis (Fig. 5A).
Surprisingly, glucose deprivation did not significantly
decrease Mcl-1 protein half-life. Mcl-1 mRNA can also be
unstable (34) and Mcl-1 transcription is highly regulated,
but real-time PCR also did not reveal additional significant
changes in Mcl-1 mRNA levels upon glucose deprivation
beyond what occurred upon IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 5B).
Akt can promote protein synthesis through the activation of
mTORC1, and interruption of this pathway may decrease

Mcl-1 after glucose deprivation. Indeed, metabolic stress has
been reported to promote AMP-activated protein kinase
activation to inhibit mTORC1 and lead to decreased Mcl-1
synthesis (14). Mcl-1 synthesis rates were, therefore, directly
measured in control and mAkt expressing FL5.12 cells by 35S
metabolic labeling and Mcl-1 immunoprecipitation. IL-3
deprivation led to a decrease in Mcl-1 synthesis in control
cells that was inhibited by mAkt expression (Fig. 5C). Importantly, the ability of mAkt to prevent the decrease in Mcl-1
synthesis upon IL-3 deprivation was dependent on glucose
metabolism, as glucose deprivation of mAkt cells sharply
decreased Mcl-1 synthesis (Fig. 5D).
Control of Mcl-1 synthesis by the mTORC1/4EBP1

differentially regulated and functionally distinct, with inhibitory phosphorylation of 4EBP1 important to promote protein
synthesis while stimulatory phosphorylation the S6K pathway
promotes cell growth and metabolism (36). IL-3 deprivation of
control cells reduced mTORC1 activity and decreased phosphorylation of 4EBP1 as well as S6K and the S6K substrate,
S6 (Fig. 6A; quantitative analyses of phosphorylation provided under each blot). Importantly, total S6 levels were
unaffected by the presence or absence of IL-3 and/or glucose
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Although IL-3 deprivation of mAkt
expressing cells led to a sharp decrease in phospho-S6,
constitutively active Akt partially sustained phospho4EBP1 in the presence of glucose. Glucose deprivation of
IL-3 deprived mAkt expressing cells, however, led to further
decreased phosphorylation of components of both mTORC1
effector pathways, with reduced phospho-S6 and phospho4EBP1. These data suggested that mAkt maintained Mcl-1
translation partially via the mTOR/4EBP1 pathway rather
than through S6K/S6. To directly test the role of S6K in
regulation of Mcl-1 levels, cells expressing mAkt alone or
together with a constitutively active form of S6K (p70 S6K1
E389-D3E) were cultured in the presence or absence of IL-3
or glucose (Fig. 6B). Although S6 remained phosphorylated,
glucose deprivation nevertheless led to decreased Mcl-1
levels, showing that the S6K1/S6 pathway is not sufficient
to support Mcl-1 expression.

www.aacrjournals.org

Because Akt relied on glucose to maintain Mcl-1 protein
synthesis via inhibition of 4EBP1, direct inhibition of mTORC1
may provide a means to limit protein translation and thus
suppress Mcl-1 expression because of its short half-life. The
mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin has shown mixed results in
cancer clinical trials (37), and recent studies have showed that
it does not completely block 4EBP1 phosphorylation (38).
Therefore, we treated cells with an active site kinase inhibitor
of mTOR, PP242, that efficiently inhibits both S6 and 4EBP1
phosphorylation (39). In both control and mAkt expressing
FL5.12 cells, PP242 treatment readily inhibited both S6 and
4EBP1 phosphorylation and led to decreased levels of Mcl-1
(Fig. 6C). mTOR kinase inhibition also impeded mAktmediated cell survival (Fig. 6D).
Inhibition of glycolysis overcomes ABT-737 resistance
in diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells
The Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w inhibitor ABT-737 has shown
promise to promote apoptosis of cancer cells, but overexpression of Mcl-1 leads to resistance (20, 21, 40). Therefore,
inhibition of glycolysis or mTOR kinase activity, to reduce
Mcl-1 protein levels, may restore sensitivity to ABT-737–
resistant cancer cells performing aerobic glycolysis. To test
this hypothesis, ABT-737–resistant variants of the diffuse large
B cell lymphoma (DLBL) cell lines Ly.1 and DHL4 (20) were
examined for synergistic induction of apoptosis by combined

glycolysis inhibition and ABT-737. By using increasing doses of
ABT-737, each cell line was shown more resistant to ABT-737
treatment than the parental strains (Supplementary Fig. S4A
and B; ref. 20). Resistance to ABT-737 appeared because of
elevated Mcl-1 in Ly.1 R7 and Ly.1 R10 and elevated Mcl-1
together with increased A1 in DHL4 R2 (ref. 20; Supplementary
Fig. S4C). Consistent with similar antiapoptotic roles for Mcl-1
and Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, neither 2DG treatment to inhibit glycolysis nor ABT-737 treatment alone were sufficient to cause
death of the resistant cell lines (Fig. 7A). Combined treatment
with 2DG and Mcl-1, however, led to rapid and near complete
cell death of both Ly.1 R7 and Ly.1 R10 cells. Similarly, a
combination of ABT-737 and 2DG caused significant cell death
of DHL4 R2 cells, albeit to not as great a degree as the Ly.1
lines. This less effective killing of DHL4 R2 cells might have
been because of the expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2
family member A1 (Supplementary Fig. S4C) that does not
seem to be sensitive to metabolic status.
If inhibition of mTORC1-dependent protein synthesis of
Mcl-1 is responsible for reduced Mcl-1 after inhibition of
aerobic glycolysis, treatment with mTOR kinase inhibitors
was likely to also restore sensitivity to ABT-737. In addition,
treatment with PP242 should reverse ABT-737 resistance
more efficiently than rapamycin because of its enhanced
ability to inhibit 4EBP1 phosphorylation and reduce Mcl-1
expression (Supplementary Fig. S4D). Although neither PP242
nor rapamycin treatment alone caused significant death of
Ly.1 R7 or Ly.1 R10 cells, combined treatment with ABT-737
caused significant cell death (Fig. 7B). Importantly, PP242 was
more efficient than rapamycin to overcome ABT-737 resis-

tance in these 2 lines. Similar to 2DG and direct glycolytic
inhibition, cell death of the DHL4 R2 cell line because of PP242
was not enhanced by ABT-737 treatment. Together, these data
show that targeting cancer cell metabolism can enhance ABT737 effectiveness and overcome ABT-737 resistance by suppressing Mcl-1 translation in glucose-dependent cells.

Discussion
The highly glycolytic metabolic phenotype of cancer cells
was first observed by Otto Warburg nearly a century ago (2).
Molecular links between aerobic glycolysis and apoptosis that
may provide a selective approach to target cancer cells for
apoptosis, however, are poorly understood. Here, we show that
inhibition of glucose metabolism can promote or sensitize
cancer cells to apoptotic cell death by decreased mTORC1/
4EBP1-dependent Mcl-1 translation that allows toxicity of
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bim. Importantly, metabolic or mTOR kinase inhibition reduced Mcl-1
protein levels and overcame resistance to the Bcl-2 inhibitor
ABT-737, suggesting this pathway may provide a mechanism
to exploit aerobic glycolysis and promote cancer cell apoptosis
either alone or as combinatorial therapy.
Aerobic glycolysis is induced in many cancers as a consequence of oncogenic kinase activity such as through the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway (4, 12, 41).
Importantly, Akt can also suppress alternative metabolic
pathways, such as suppression of lipid uptake and oxidation
through phosphorylation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1
(42) or by inhibition of autophagy as an alternate nutrient

Metabolic Control of Mcl-1 and ABT-737 Resistance

Figure 7. Inhibition of glycolysis or mTOR kinase activity can overcome ABT-737 resistance. A, Ly.1 R7, Ly.1 R10, and DHL4 R2 cells were cultured with
sublethal doses of 2DG (5 mmol/L for Ly.1 R7 and R10, 1 mmol/L for DHL4 R2), ABT-737 (0.1 mmol/L for Ly.1 R7 and R10, 1 mmol/L for DHL4 R2), or
both drugs together and assayed for cell death by PI exclusion over time. B, Ly.1 R7, Ly.1 R10, and DHL4 R2 cells were cultured with PP242 (1 mmol/L),
rapamycin (25 nmol/L), ABT-737 (0.1 mmol/L for Ly.1 R7 and R10, 1 mmol/L for DHL4 R2), or the indicated combinations and assayed for cell death by
PI exclusion over time. Values represent the means  SD of duplicate experiments.

source in metabolically stressed cells (43). The overall effect,
therefore, is to render cells with constitutively active Akt
dependent on glucose availability and glycolytic metabolism
whereas normal cells can retain greater metabolic flexibility.
Thus, although all cells utilize glucose as fuel, cancer cells may
be particularly sensitive to glycolytic inhibition to reduce Mcl1. Coupling inhibition of glucose metabolism with targeted
treatments may further selectively impact cancer cells (6).
This study has further implicated the importance of the
mTORC1/4EBP1 pathway in metabolic stress to regulate Mcl1 protein synthesis. Mcl-1 is highly regulated and distinguished from Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL by a short half-life and
enhanced reliance on continued translation. Decreased rates
of Mcl-1 synthesis in response to metabolic stress, coupled
with its rapid turnover, reduced Mcl-1 expression to sensitize
cells to apoptosis. Importantly, changes in Mcl-1 expression
observed here were modest yet sufficient to allow Bimmediated toxicity, highlighting the importance of this pathway. Also, it is likely that inhibition of glucose metabolism or
mTOR kinase activity does not specifically reduce Mcl-1
translation, but inhibits general protein synthesis (36). How-

ever, because of the very short half-life of Mcl-1 relative to
other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Mcl-1 levels may be
a central determinant in cell death when glucose metabolism
is disrupted.
The mechanism by which inhibition of glucose metabolism
inhibits mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and
Mcl-1 translation remains unclear. Our data show that inhibition of glycolysis causes decreased ATP levels, for which
oxidative metabolism cannot fully compensate. This may lead
to activation of AMPK, resulting in the inhibition of mTORC1
activity and suppression of Mcl-1 translation (14, 44–47).
Inactivation of all mTOR activity, however, would decrease
Akt phosphorylation, as mTORC2 is the Akt serine 473 kinase
(48). 2DG treatment or glucose deprivation of cells with
oncogenic Akt, however, did not reduce Akt S473 phosphorylation or phosphorylation of the Akt substrate, GSK3. In
contrast, the mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and PP242 each
decreased phospho-Akt, suggesting that glucose deprivation
causes specific inhibition of mTORC1 in a manner distinct
from either rapamycin or PP242. A more detailed understanding of how glucose deprivation can affect mTOR activity

in the context of cancer cells to selectively block mTORC1 will
be essential in understanding how metabolism-targeted therapies might enhance cell death.
We have previously shown that glucose deprivation leads
to induction of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Puma and
Bim, and reduced levels of Mcl-1 (8, 9). Similarly, glucose
deprivation of activated T cells and other cancer cells can
lead to reduced levels of Mcl-1 (13, 14). Regulation of the
balance of Bcl-2 family proteins by glucose metabolism may
be a critical aspect of how aerobic glycolysis can affect cell
fate. Many cancer cells are considered primed for apoptosis
by upregulation of proapoptotic BH3 only proteins, such as
Bim, Puma, or Noxa, to occupy antiapoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
and Mcl-1 (49). Metabolic status and nutrient availability
may alter the primed state of cancer cells to influence
susceptibility to other cancer therapeutics that induce apoptosis. It is the unique dependence of Mcl-1 on cell metabolism that places it as a central regulator of cell survival to
inhibit proapoptotic proteins, including Bim, upon disruption of cancer metabolism.
Metabolically-targeted therapies offer promising pharmacologic targets for cancer therapy. Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, however, must be overcome
to promote cancer cell death. Mcl-1 levels have been closely
associated with resistance to the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT737 (20-22, 40, 50), and our data show that inhibition of aerobic
glycolysis or mTOR kinase activity can suppress protein

synthesis leading to a reduction in Mcl-1 levels that sensitizes
cells to cytotoxicity mediated by Bim and potentially other
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (36). Metabolic control of
Mcl-1 synthesis, therefore, is essential for growth factor independent survival of cancer cells, and metabolism-targeted
therapies may provide useful options for novel cancer treatments to reduce Mcl-1 and increase cancer cell apoptotic
sensitivity.
