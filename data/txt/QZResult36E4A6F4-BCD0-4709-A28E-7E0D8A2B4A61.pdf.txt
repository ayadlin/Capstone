BACKGROUND: Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from nonovarian malignancies long has been regarded as a terminal
disease. Over the past decade, new locoregional therapeutic approaches combining cytoreductive surgery with perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIC) have evolved that have demonstrated improved survival. METHODS: A
retrospective, multicenter cohort study was performed in French-speaking institutions to evaluate toxicity and principal
prognostic factors after cytoreductive surgery and PIC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy [HIPEC] and/or
early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy [EPIC]) for PC from nongynecologic malignancies. RESULTS: The
study included 1290 patients from 25 institutions who underwent 1344 procedures between February 1989 and December 2007. HIPEC was performed in 1154 procedures. The principal origins of PC were colorectal adenocarcinoma (N ¼
523), pseudomyxoma peritonei (N ¼ 301), gastric adenocarcinoma (N ¼ 159), peritoneal mesothelioma (N ¼ 88), and
appendiceal adenocarcinoma (N ¼ 50). The overall morbidity and mortality rates were 33.6% and 4.1%, respectively. In
multivariate analysis, patient age, the extent of PC, and institutional experience had a significant influence on toxicity.
The overall median survival was 34 months; and the median survival was 30 months for patients with colorectal PC, not
reached for patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei, 9 months for patients with gastric PC, 41 months for patients with
peritoneal mesothelioma, and 77 months for patients with PC from appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Independent prognostic indicators in multivariate analysis were institution, origin of PC, completeness of cytoreductive surgery, extent of
carcinomatosis, and lymph node involvement. CONCLUSIONS: A therapeutic approach that combined cytoreductive
surgery with PIC was able to achieve long-term survival in a selected group of patients who had PC of nonovarian origin and had acceptable morbidity and mortality. The current results indicated that this treatment should be centralized

Treatment of Peritoneal Carcinomatosis/Glehen et al

The primary peritoneal malignancies, such as peritoneal
mesothelioma or papillary serous carcinoma, are rare. In
contrast, peritoneal dissemination from digestive cancers
is common. In the past, carcinomatosis was regarded as a
terminal disease, and most oncologists viewed it as a condition only to be palliated. However, recent reports
describe curative treatment options for selected patients
with carcinomatosis from nongynecologic cancer.1-5
Over the past 2 decades, novel therapeutic approaches
to peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) have emerged that combine cytoreductive surgery and peritonectomy procedures6
with perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (PIC),
including hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
(HIPEC) and/or early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC).7-9 Theoretically, cytoreductive surgery is
performed to treat macroscopic disease, and PIC is used to
treat microscopic residual disease with the objective of
removing disease completely in a single procedure. Many
consider it the standard of care for diseases like pseudomyxoma peritonei or peritoneal mesothelioma.2,5,10 Moreover, it is the only plan that has produced curative results for
carcinomatosis in international registries,11 in several phase 2
trials, and in 1 phase 3 trial.3,12-14 Despite all of these studies
suggesting a survival benefit, oncologists remain skeptical
regarding this combined therapeutic approach partly because
of its perceived high toxicity. A collaborative effort of 25
French-speaking institutions involved in the treatment of
peritoneal surface malignancies was performed on a large
number of patients with PC from nongynecologic carcinomatosis to evaluate the tolerance and the efficacy of this

treatment, to answer questions regarding patient selection, and to identify principal prognostic indicators.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
One thousand two hundred ninety patients who had
undergone 1344 procedures combining cytoreductive
surgery and PIC for the treatment of PC from nonovarian
origin between February 1989 and December 2007 made
up the study population. The inclusion criteria were
primary PC or PC of nonovarian origin confirmed by
pathologic examination with HIPEC, EPIC, or both
administered within 7 days of surgery. The exclusion
criteria were PIC performed >7 days after the surgery and
the presence of extra-abdominal metastases.
Standardized clinical data on consecutive patients
from each of 25 institutions involved in the management of
peritoneal surface malignancies (France, 20 institutions;
Belgium, 2 institutions; Quebec, Canada, 2 institutions;
and Switzerland, 1 institution) were received and entered
into a central database. Institutions provided data on
between 1 and 400 patients. Figure 1 lists the periods during
which patients were studied. The same author reviewed all
data sheets before their entry into the database in an effort
to make this a uniform interpretation of retrospective data.
Data Forms
A standard data form was created to retrieve information
on the origin of PC and the status of the patient before
undergoing the combined procedure, including age, sex,

extent of PC, and previous treatment with systemic chemotherapy. The extent of PC was assessed intraoperatively.
Institutions used 2 different tools, the Gilly classification15 and the Sugarbaker Peritoneal Cancer Index
(PCI),16 to assess the extent of PC. By using the Gilly
classification, carcinomatosis was classified into 5 stages:
stage 0, positive peritoneal cytology; stage I, malignant
tumor nodules <5 mm in greatest dimension localized to
1 part of the abdomen; stage II, diffuse throughout the
whole abdomen; stage III, tumor nodules between 5 mm
and 2 cm in greatest dimension; and stage IV, large tumor
deposits (>2 cm in greatest dimension). For the descriptive analysis, 4 subgroups according to the PCI score were
created: 1 to 6, 7 to 12, 13 to 19, and >19. Information
recorded about the combined procedure included the
date, the completeness of cytoreductive surgery, the
simultaneous resection of primary tumor or of liver metastases, the presence or absence of lymph node metastases,
the type of perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy
(HIPEC or EPIC) and its modalities (drugs used,
‘‘closed’’ or ‘‘open’’ HIPEC, temperatures, duration), and
treatment with adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. The
assessment of the completeness of the cancer resection
(CCR) by cytoreductive surgery was performed by the
surgeon at the end of the procedure and was classified in 3
categories4: CCR-0 (no macroscopic residual cancer
remaining), CCR-1 (no residual nodule >2.5 mm), and
CCR-2 (residual nodules >2.5 mm in greatest dimension). The institutions were classified regarding their
length of experience with performing cytoreductive
surgery at the time of the procedure (0-3 years, 3-7 years,
7-11 years, and >11 years). Four groups also were analyzed regarding the period of the procedure (before 1997,
between 1997 and 1999, between 2000 and 2002,
between 2003 and 2004, and after 2005). Information
was obtained regarding the postoperative course, including postoperative death (within 30 postoperative days)
and its cause, major complications (grade 3 and 4 complications according to the National Cancer Institute’s
Common Toxicity Criteria), and reoperations. Follow-up
data recorded included the date of the most recent followup, the status of the patient (alive with disease, alive
without disease, dead with disease, or dead without
disease), the site of initial recurrence, and all other
subsequent sites of recurrence.
Statistical Analysis
The descriptive analyses of the patients who were included
in the registry and the survival analyses were performed on

5610

a patient basis (1 record per patient). However, all procedures were considered for the analyses of postoperative
morbidity or mortality events (death or major complications that occurred within 30 days after surgery). Categorical variables are described in terms of frequency and
percentages. The distributions of continuous variables are
described as the mean, standard error, median, and first
and third quartiles. The influence of patient, disease, and
treatment characteristics was related to the risk of postoperative morbidity or mortality events using univariate
and multivariate logistic regression models that were
adjusted by institution. The analysis of long-term mortality censored information after the cutoff date of December 31, 2006, because an active enquiry was performed in
all institutions to collect the status (dead/alive) of the
patients at that date. There were 72 patients included after
the cutoff date, 4 patients had an unknown date of death,
and 46 patients were lost to follow-up (the last follow-up
before the cutoff date). The analysis of total mortality
considered the interval from the first procedure to the
date of death, the date of last follow-up, or the cutoff date,
whichever came first. The analysis of recurrence or death
was based on the interval from the first procedure to the
date of first recurrence, the date of death, the date of last
follow-up, or the cutoff date, whichever came first. When
the date of recurrence was unknown in patients who died,
the date of death was used instead. For this analysis, 32
patients were lost to follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival
estimates were calculated and compared between strata
with the log-rank test. The influence of baseline risk factors on the hazard of death was assessed using a multiple
proportional hazards regression model stratified by institution. Stratification was justified by a large heterogeneity
of hazards between institutions and by a strong potential
confounding effect on other risk factors. In all multivariate analyses, age and PCI were entered as continuous
variables. Completeness of cytoreduction (4 categories)
also was entered as a continuous variable when justified by
a linear trend across categories. Risk factors with a significance degree .10 were retained in the final model. SAS
statistical software for Windows (version 9.1; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all analyses.

RESULTS
Twenty-5 institutions treated 1290 patients who underwent 1344 procedures. One institution recorded >403
patients, 3 institutions recorded 100 to 300 patients, 3
institutions recorded 50 to 100 patients, 4 institutions

Patient Characteristics
There were 728 women (56.5%) and 562 men (43.5%),
and the mean  standard deviation (SD) patient age was
52  12 years. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status was 0 or 1 for 95% of patients. The origin of PC was mainly colorectal adenocarcinoma
(40.5%), followed by pseudomyxoma peritonei (23.3%),
gastric cancer (12.3%), peritoneal mesothelioma (6.8%),
and appendiceal adenocarcinoma (3.9%) (Table 1). In
the majority of patients, the diagnosis of carcinomatosis
was an incidental finding at laparoscopy or laparotomy
(Table 2). Radiologic examinations were performed for
diagnosis or to assess disease extent and included abdominal computed tomodensitometry (CT) for 1047 patients
(81.2%), positron emission tomography CT for 331
patients (25.7%), and magnetic resonance imaging for 48
patients (3.7%). One hundred thirteen patients (8.8%)
underwent laparoscopy. Six hundred seventy-five patients

(52.3%) had received previous neoadjuvant or palliative
systemic chemotherapy with a mean  SD number of 7.4
 4.8 cycles.
Treatment
The assessment of carcinomatosis extent was performed
using the Gilly classification for 678 patients (53%) and
the PCI for 1152 patients (89%). The Gilly stage was 0
in 42 patients (6.2%), 1 in 89 patients (13.1%), 2 in
124 patients (18.3%), 3 in 165 patients (24.3%), and 4
in 258 patients (38.1%). The mean  SD PCI was
13.1  8.9.
After the best surgical effort at cytoreductive surgery,
950 patients were classified with CCR-0 reductions
(74.7%), 218 patients were classified with CCR-1 reductions (17.1%), and 104 patients were classified with CCR-2
reductions (8.2%). Synchronous liver metastases were present (and were resected) in 125 patients (11%). The cytoreductive surgery was synchronous with resection of the
primary tumor in 328 patients (32.9%). One thousand one
hundred six patients (85.8%) received HIPEC, and 211
patients (16.6%) received EPIC. HIPEC was combined
with EPIC in 37 patients (3.3%). The drugs and regimens
that were used for this intraperitoneal chemotherapy are
reported in Table 3. All HIPEC procedures were performed
intraoperatively after cytoreductive surgery but with variations in exposure techniques (open abdomen in 700 patients
[65.2%] and closed abdomen in 373 patients [35%]),
drugs, duration (30-120 minutes; mean  SD duration,
59.5  28.7 minutes), intraperitoneal temperature (4043 C; mean  SD intraperitoneal temperature, 42.5 

perioperative surgery, and 4 patients underwent a third
procedure. Four hundred seventeen patients (34.8%)
received postoperative adjuvant systemic chemotherapy
when they demonstrated an objective response to preoperative chemotherapy (if administered) or when they had
bad prognostic features (CCR-1 or CCR-2 reduction,
involved lymph nodes, or liver metastases), with a mean
 SD of 7.6  4.5 cycles.
Postoperative Mortality and Morbidity
Fifty-two patients (4.1%) died postoperatively. The main
causes of death were multiorgan failure (11 patients),
septic shock (10 patients), respiratory complications
(10 patients), digestive fistula or peritonitis (4 patients),
cardiorespiratory failure (3 patients), pulmonary embolism (2 patients), cardiac arrhythmia (2 patients), hemorrhagic shock (2 patients), hematologic toxicity (2 patients),
and acute renal insufficiency (2 patients).

Figure 2. Overall and disease-free survival rates are illustrated
for 1290 patients who had peritoneal carcinomatosis of
digestive or primary origin.

Major complications (grade 3 and 4 complications)
occurred in 403 patients (33.6%). Details of postoperative
complications are reported in Table 4. A reoperation was
necessary in 173 patients (14%). Neutropenia was the principal complication and occurred in 157 patients (13.3%).
Digestive fistula occurred in 119 patients (9.7%). The mean
 SD duration of hospitalization was 24.1  17.4 days.
In univariate analysis, several factors had no significant influence on postoperative complications: sex, origin
of carcinomatosis, performance status, treatment with a
second or third procedure, treatment with neoadjuvant
systemic chemotherapy, synchronous resection of liver
metastasis, and period of the procedure. The impact of
the PIC techniques (drugs, drug concentration, temperature, duration) could not be analyzed because of significant variations across centers. The logistic multiple
regression analysis of factors that significantly increased
the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality revealed
3 important factors: an increased risk of death or postoperative complication with increasing age (P ¼ .02), the
extent of carcinomatosis assessed by the PCI (P < .0001),
and the institution where the treatment was performed
(P < .0001).
Survival
The median follow-up was 45.3 months (first to third
quartiles, 20.3-90.9 months). The overall 1-year, 3-year,
and 5-year survival rates were 77%, 49%, and 37%,
respectively; and the corresponding disease-free survival
rates were 55%, 28%, and 22%, respectively (Fig. 2). The
overall median survival was 34 months, and it was 30

surgery (CC-0 resection). The multivariate analysis identified 3 significant prognostic factors: the extent of carcinomatosis assessed by the PCI (P < .001), the etiology of
PC (P < .001), and age >52 years (P ¼ .029), with an
increased risk of death of 10.7% for every 5-year increase
in age (95% confidence interval, 1.1%-21.2%).

months for colorectal PC, not reached for pseudomyxome
peritonei, 9 months for gastric PC, 41 months for peritoneal mesothelioma, and 77 months for PC from appendiceal adenocarcinoma (Fig. 3).
In univariate analysis, the only factor that did not
have prognostic impact was treatment with EPIC and the
PCI. All other clinical and therapeutic factors had a significant prognostic impact (Tables 5 and 6). Patients aged
>61 years had a significantly shorter survival than
younger patients (P < .001). There was a strong prognostic influence of the center at which procedures were performed (P < .001). Institutions with experience >7 years
produced significantly improved survival (P < .001)
(Fig. 4). There was a significant improvement in survival
from 1989 to 2004 (Fig. 5). The impact of PIC techniques (drugs and concentrations used, temperature, duration) could not be analyzed because of marked variations
between institutions.
In multivariate analysis, the principal independent
prognostic factors in addition to the effects of treatment
center were the etiology of PC (P < .001), the carcinomatosis extent assessed with the Sugarbaker PCI (P < .001), the
completeness of cytoreduction (P < .001) (Fig. 6), and the
presence of lymph node involvement (P ¼ .001) (Table 7).
The multivariate analysis of disease-free survival selected
the same prognostic factors plus the presence of liver metastases (P ¼ .008) with an increased risk of recurrence of
44% (95% confidence interval, 9.8%-88.8%).
We also specifically studied the prognostic factors in
patients who had undergone complete cytoreductive

DISCUSSION
Peritoneal carcinomatosis of gastrointestinal or primary
origin long has been considered a fatal clinical entity to be
treated palliatively. Since the 1980s, the development of
new surgical techniques (cytoreductive surgery and peritonectomy procedures) combined with PIC (and, preferentially, HIPEC) have provided new hope of a potential
cure for patients with PC. Now, curing PC is a realistic
goal. The experiences of many single institutions, combined with phase 2 studies,12-14,17,18 an international
registry,11 and a phase 3 trial,3 have produced encouraging survival results after treatment of PC with this therapeutic strategy. This has led to the development of new
specialized centers for the management of peritoneal
surface malignancies that are treating increasing numbers
of patients (Fig. 1). This collaborative effort of 25 institutions collected data from 1290 patients and, to our knowledge, represents the largest experience in the treatment
of PC published to date. With a median follow-up of
45.3 months and a low rate of patients lost to follow-up
(4%), the overall median survival was 34 months, and the
disease-free survival rate at 5 years was 22%. For rare
diseases like pseudomyxoma peritonei or peritoneal mesothelioma, the combination of cytoreductive surgery with
PIC already is considered by many as the standard of
care2,5,10 The current large, retrospective experience
confirms that 5-year survival rates >70% may be obtained
for patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei, and a median
survival of >40 months may be obtained for patients with
peritoneal mesothelioma. Both of these etiologies have a
very different biology than other malignancies and represent the best indication for such a therapeutic strategy.
For patients with PC from colorectal cancers, a median
survival of 30 months and a 5-year survival rate of 26%
were observed with this combined treatment. Palliative
systemic chemotherapy reportedly produces a median
survival between 7 months and 24 months; and, in these
patients, long-term survival is rarely, if ever, achieved.13,19,20
These results are similar to those obtained in a previous
multicenter retrospective study.11 For PC from gastric
cancer, the median survival reported was only 9 months,
reflecting either a more aggressive disease process that was

One of the most important issues arising from our
analysis is the strong influence of the institution not only
on survival but also on morbidity and morbidity rates.

when the analysis was adjusted based on the center.
However, it is reasonable to assume that experience may
provide better patient selection, surgical expertise, and
postoperative management. A learning curve already
had been reported by several authors. Moran reported a
decreased mortality rate from 18% down to 3%,21 The
Netherlands Cancer Institute reported a decrease in
mortality from 8% to 4%,22 and Yan et al reported a
decrease from 7% to 1%.23 All interventional complex
procedures have an inherent risk, and experience
undoubtedly diminishes but can never abolish this
risk.24

The morbidity and mortality rates of 33.6% and
4.1%, respectively, are similar to those reported after
other major surgical procedures, such as esophagectomy
or pancreaticoduodenectomy, With the potential survival
benefit demonstrated after cytoreductive surgery for PC,
these rates are acceptable. Morbidity increased significantly with age, and this treatment approach may need
careful consideration in individuals aged >70 years who
have multiple comorbidities. The extent of PC assessed by
the PCI remains the most reliable tool in the evaluation of
carcinomatosis extent. A higher PCI tended to result in
more extensive cytoreduction. Although PIC has its own
morbidity (neutropenia, renal insufficiency with the use

of cisplatin) and may have increased the rate of some
surgical complications (fistula), most complications that
we observed were caused by the surgery itself (digestive
fistula, intraperitoneal hemorrhage, and abscesses).
The extent of carcinomatosis also had a significant
influence on survival and was correlated strongly with the
completeness of cytoreduction (ie, the size of residual
tumor nodules). For intraperitoneal chemotherapy to be
effective, residual disease after attempted cytoreductive
surgery must be of low volume. For colorectal or gastric
carcinomatosis, long-term survival was obtained only by
patients who underwent complete macroscopic resection
(CCR-0). Elias et al13 recently reported a 5-year survival
rate of >50% and a median survival of 63 months for

CCR-1 resection (residual tumor nodules <2.5 mm in
greatest dimension) may be acceptable and may result in
long-term survival when combined with PIC.2,10
Independent negative prognostic indicators included
lymph node involvement. This traditionally indicates
systemic spread of disease. A locoregional therapeutic
approach for a disease that is no longer confined to
the peritoneum will be inadequate. Additional diseasespecific, systemic chemotherapy is indicated for these
patients. Future prospective studies should determine
whether this systemic chemotherapy should be given in
either the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting or both. Preoperative identification of systemic disease would allow
clinicians to tailor neoadjuvant therapy before attempting
cytoreductive surgery and PIC. Although extraperitoneal
sites of disease spread can be identified radiologically,
lymph node involvement still is primarily a pathologic
assessment. Outcomes may be improved if techniques for
detecting systemic disease can be developed. However
neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy for patients with
resectable PC who have no evidence of systemic spread
may jeopardize the chance of achieving complete cytoreduction or may increase morbidity in an attempt to
achieve such reduction.
The impact of PIC is difficult to assess because of
the heterogeneity in techniques used. None of the variables in PIC that we studied (closed or open technique,
drug, temperature, duration) were significant in multivariate analysis in their impact on morbidity, mortality, or
survival. Some authors have reported improved survival
with hyperthermia (but always in retrospective studies)
for patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei and colorectal
PC.7,25 Because of its design, no firm conclusions can be
drawn regarding PIC techniques from this retrospective
study. Institutional experience and expertise are likely to
be the most important variables in limiting procedurerelated toxicity and improving survival.9
Despite its bias because of its design and the exclusion of all patients who were inoperable or who underwent palliative surgery, this large multicenter study
demonstrated that a potential cure of PC is a realistic goal
in selected patients and that PC should not be considered
a terminal event. The principal prognostic factors that we
identified were the origin of PC, carcinomatosis extent
assessed by the PCI, the completeness of cytoreductive
surgery, and the involvement of lymph nodes. Complete
cytoreductive surgery with the objective of removing all
macroscopic disease, combined with PIC performed in an
experienced peritoneal surface malignancy center, may

provide long-term survival with acceptable morbidity and
mortality rates.
