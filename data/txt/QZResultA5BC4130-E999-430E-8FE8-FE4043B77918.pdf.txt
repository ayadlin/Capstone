Abstract
Sipuleucel-T is an autologous cellular therapy for asymptomatic, or minimally symptomatic, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, designed to stimulate an immune
response against prostate cancer. In a recent clinical trial
(NCT00715104), we found that neoadjuvant sipuleucel-T
increased the number of activated T cells within the tumor
microenvironment. The current analysis examined whether
sipuleucel-T altered adaptive T-cell responses by expanding
pre-existing T cells or by recruiting new T cells to prostate tissue.
Next-generation sequencing of the T-cell receptor (TCR) genes
from blood or prostate tissue was used to quantitate and track Tcell clonotypes in these treated subjects with prostate cancer. At
baseline, there was a signiﬁcantly greater diversity of circulating
TCR sequences in subjects with prostate cancer compared with
healthy donors. Among healthy donors, circulating TCR

sequence diversity remained unchanged over the same time
interval. In contrast, sipuleucel-T treatment reduced circulating
TCR sequence diversity versus baseline as measured by the
Shannon index. Interestingly, sipuleucel-T treatment resulted
in greater TCR sequence diversity in resected prostate tissue in
sipuleucel-T–treated subjects versus tissue of nonsipuleucel-T–
treated subjects with prostate cancer. Furthermore, sipuleucel-T
increased TCR sequence commonality between blood and
resected prostate tissue in treated versus untreated subjects with
prostate cancer. The broadening of the TCR repertoire within the
prostate tissue supports the hypothesis that sipuleucel-T treatment facilitates the recruitment of T cells into the prostate. Our
results highlight the importance of assessing T-cell response to
immunotherapy both in the periphery and in tumor tissue.

Introduction

that early clinical responses, such as prevention of disease
progression, are not frequently observed soon after treatment
(3). Similar to traditional vaccine approaches, cellular immunotherapy aims to engage the immune system by activating
effector T cells and dampening immunosuppressive factors,
ultimately facilitating the inﬁltration of lymphocytes into the
tumor environment (4, 5). Sipuleucel-T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy, approved by the FDA for the treatment
of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate-resistant (hormone-refractory) prostate cancer (mCRPC;
ref. 6), that increases overall survival (7) and generates antigenspeciﬁc immune responses that correlate with increased overall
survival (8). In addition, sipuleucel-T induced inﬁltration of T
cells into prostate cancer tissue (9) in an open-label, phase II
trial of neoadjuvant sipuleucel-T (NeoACT; ClinicalTrials.gov
identiﬁer: NCT00715104). The NeoACT trial was the ﬁrst to
demonstrate that sipuleucel-T induced a local immune effect
(10). Neoadjuvant sipuleucel-T elicited a systemic antigenspeciﬁc T-cell response and recruited activated effector T cells
into the prostate tumor microenvironment (10).
Although immunotherapy, such as sipuleucel-T, clearly alters
the immune response to cancer, identifying the best method to
measure and quantify such immune responses remains a challenge because of the difﬁculty in obtaining an adequate quantity
of samples and the limitations of current functional assays. One
method of analyzing the adaptive immune system response
involves proﬁling the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, thereby
obtaining the relative abundance and diversity of T-cell clones
(11). Novel emerging technologies, such as next-generation

In recent years, immunotherapies have emerged as important
and ground-breaking treatment approaches. They are designed
to harness the immune system using a vaccine-like modality to
attack chronic and preexisting conditions, such as cancer,
infections, and other diseases (1). Like traditional vaccines,
cell-based immunotherapy can activate the adaptive arm of the
immune system, speciﬁcally T cells, and in cancer aim to
produce or augment immune responses to tumor-associated
antigens (2). However, unlike vaccines, immunotherapies pose
a challenge in terms of interpretation of efﬁcacy due to the fact

sequencing (NGS), have recently begun to be used to assess TCR
repertoires (12, 13) and may be useful in understanding immunotherapy-induced immune system changes (14, 15). The power
of NGS is derived from its ability to examine unique sequences
with inferred antigen speciﬁcity, or clonality, which mirrors the
TCR repertoire, to enhance the speed of clonotyping analysis and
to detect low-abundance clones (16).
The goal of the current exploratory analysis of the NeoACT trial
was to build upon the prior report showing antigen-speciﬁc T-cell
response and T-cell inﬁltration into the prostate (10). We used
NGS to characterize the complex changes in the TCR b-chain
repertoire in paired sequential samples from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and posttreatment radical prostatectomy tissues from a small number of subjects with localized CRPC. These
exploratory analyses sought to ascertain the extent to which
sipuleucel-T modiﬁes the diversity of the T-cell compartments
both spatially and temporally. Herein, we report on the effects of
sipuleucel-T therapy on the TCR repertoire of circulating T cells
and on T cells within prostate tumor tissue.

Patients and Methods
Sipuleucel-T treatment and trial design
The manufacture of sipuleucel-T has been described previously
(8). NeoACT (P07-1; NCT00715104) was a single-arm, multicenter phase II trial of open-label, neoadjuvant sipuleucel-T
treatment in men with localized prostate cancer administered
before planned radical prostatectomy (10, 17). NeoACT was
conducted in accordance with applicable regulations of the FDA
and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International
Conference on Harmonisation, and all subjects gave written
informed consent to participate in the protocol approved by the
Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of each participating institution. Subjects received sipuleucel-T [prepared by culturing freshly
obtained leukapheresis peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) with a fusion protein of prostatic acid phosphatase and
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)] at
the standard 2-week intervals for three planned doses (8). Radical
prostatectomy was performed 2 to 3 weeks after the ﬁnal sipuleucel-T infusion (Supplementary Fig. S1).
DNA isolation
Genomic DNA was extracted from PBMCs using the QIAmp
DNA Maxi Kit (Qiagen Inc.). Radical prostatectomy formalin-ﬁxed,
parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tissue was extracted using the QIAmp
DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen Inc.) as per the manufacturer's
instructions (18). TCR sequence proﬁling was performed using
DNA extracted from preculture PBMCs (as previously described in
refs. 7, 8) derived from leukapheresis of sipuleucel-T–treated
patients, from whole blood of healthy donors at weeks 0, 2, and
4, and from whole blood of nonsipuleucel-T–treated control subjects with prostate cancer at baseline. For tissue sequencing, the
entire FFPE sections were used. Blood and/or tissue samples from
sipuleucel-T–treated subjects, nontreated healthy donors, and nonsipuleucel-T–treated control subjects with prostate cancer were
randomly selected from available samples.
Healthy donors and nonsipuleucel-T–treated control subjects
Whole blood was collected from healthy adult male donors
who provided written informed consent in accordance with
Western IRB approval. Non-sipuleucel-T–treated control subjects

3712 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

with prostate cancer were identiﬁed as described previously
(10) and comprised patients who had undergone radical
prostatectomy at the University of California San Francisco
(UCSF; San Francisco, CA) during the same time period but had
not received any preoperative therapy. Control subjects with
prostate cancer were selected on the basis of a distribution of
preoperative risk criteria that was analogous to the disease risk in
the subjects participating in the NeoACT trial. The control subjects
provided written consent for the use of their specimens for
research (UCSF IRB-approved protocol for human subjects
research #11-05226).
High-throughput TCR sequencing
The TCRb CD3 (CDR3b) region was ampliﬁed and
sequenced from a standardized 1,200 ng of DNA using the
ImmunoSEQ assay (Adaptive Biotechnologies). In this assay, a
multiplex PCR system was used to amplify the rearranged
CDR3b sequences from sample DNA. The 87 base-pair fragment is sufﬁcient to identify the VDJ region spanning each
unique CDR3b (19, 20). Amplicons were sequenced using the
Illumina platform. TCRb V, D, and J gene deﬁnitions were
provided by the IMGT database (www.imgt.org). The assay is
quantitative, using a complete synthetic repertoire of TCRs to
establish an ampliﬁcation baseline and to adjust the assay
chemistry to correct for primer bias. In addition, barcoded,
spiked-in synthetic templates were used to measure the degree
of sequencing coverage and residual PCR bias (21). This information was used for further PCR bias correction and to estimate
the abundance of sequenceable templates in each sample. The
resulting data are ﬁltered and clustered using both the relative
frequency ratio between similar sequences and a modiﬁed
nearest-neighbor algorithm, to merge closely related sequences
and remove both PCR and sequencing errors.
Determination of TCR sequence diversity
The Shannon diversity index reﬂects clonal or TCR repertoire
diversity within and between populations (22) and was used to
measure the diversity of the clonotype population at each time
point. The Shannon diversity index was calculated using the
P
formula ni ¼ 1 pi loge ðpi Þ, where pi is the frequency of clonotype
i for the sample with n unique clonotypes (22). The R package
"Diversity Sampler" was used to calculate the Shannon diversity
index (23, 24).
Determination of TCR sequence commonality between two
samples
The Baroni–Urbani and Buser (BUB) index was applied as a
measure of the commonality between TCR sequences in the blood
and radical prostatectomy tissue across different time points for
each subject. The BUB index ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 denoting
completely separate populations and 1 denoting two populations
in complete concordance. The BUB index was calculated in R
pﬃﬃﬃﬃ
using the formula pﬃﬃﬃﬃ cd þ c , where a represents the number of
cd þ a þ b  c

unique sequences in one population, b represents the number of
unique sequences in the second population, c represents the
number of unique sequences that are found in both populations,
and d represents the number of unique sequences that are not
found in either population but are found in the rest of the
populations (24, 25).

T-cell Clonotype Change with Sipuleucel-T Treatment

Determination of clonal frequency change
The fold change (FC) in the frequency count at week 2 or week 4
was computed to examine the change in TCR sequence frequency
over time relative to week 0. FC was deﬁned as the sequence
frequency count at the later time point divided by the sequence
frequency at week 0. For each time point comparison for each
sequence, a sequence was categorized as increased if FC is 2, as
decreased if FC is 0.5, and as unchanged if 0.5 < FC < 2. All TCR
sequences detectable at any time point at week 0, 2, or 4 were
included in the analysis. For each subject and each time point
comparison, the percentage of TCR sequences falling into each
change category was computed.

Results
Sipuleucel-T treatment reduces TCR Shannon index in the
blood of subjects with prostate cancer
We compared changes in the TCR sequence frequency
between baseline (week 0) and week 2 in blood samples
isolated from healthy donors and sipuleucel-T–treated subjects.
The resultant sequence scatter matrices revealed a substantial
increase in the number of productive sequences (each of them
deﬁning a unique T-cell clone) and greater differences in the
sipuleucel-T–treated subject matrix compared with the healthy
donor matrix (Fig. 1). In addition, a larger number of total
productive sequences were evident in the blood of sipuleucelT–treated subjects compared with healthy donors at all timepoints examined. However, because this type of bulk visualization analysis fails to distinguish minute TCR repertoire alternations, we conducted additional analyses to address whether
the complex observed changes in the TCR repertoire may reveal
treatment-related effects.
We assessed the TCR repertoire in patient leukapheresis samples at each of the three sipuleucel-T treatment time points (weeks
0, 2, and 4). As a comparator for natural variance, or changes in
TCR proﬁles, we also assessed the TCR repertoire from healthy
subjects who provided blood samples over the same time points.
Because each TCR sequence corresponds to a unique TCR transcript, we were able to determine the total number of unique TCR
sequences in each group. Sipuleucel-T–treated subjects had a
signiﬁcantly higher number of unique TCR sequences at baseline
compared with week 2 and week 4 (P < 0.01), but no such
differences were observed in the healthy donors (Fig. 2A). These

results demonstrate a signiﬁcant decrease in the number of unique
TCR sequences in the blood following sipuleucel-T treatment.
To evaluate the effect of the observed decrease in the number
of unique TCR sequences on T-cell repertoire diversity over
time, we next examined whether there was a difference in
the TCR repertoire diversity over time using the Shannon
diversity index (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). There was
decreasing TCR diversity in the peripheral blood of sipuleucelT–treated subjects between baseline (week 0) and weeks 2 and
4 (P < 0.001), but no such change in TCR diversity over time
was evident in the peripheral blood of healthy donors (Fig. 2B).
The Shannon diversity index was numerically greater at each
time point in sipuleucel-T–treated subjects compared with
healthy donors (Fig. 2B). Overall, these data suggest that the
TCR repertoire is more diverse in subjects with prostate cancer
compared with healthy donors and that sipuleucel-T treatment
results in decreased TCR diversity.
Sipuleucel-T treatment drives change in the T-cell repertoire
To better understand the potential mechanism behind the
observed changes in TCR sequence diversity, we examined how
the circulating TCR repertoire was affected by sipuleucel-T
treatment (i.e., loss and/or enrichment of TCR sequences). In
each group, we examined the entire TCR repertoire that was
present at any of the time points and found that a greater
proportion of TCR sequences decreased at week 2 and week 4 in
the sipuleucel-T–treated subjects (57.2% and 54.0%, respectively) compared with the healthy donors (32.1% and 31.9%,
respectively; Fig. 3A), which further suggests narrowing of the
TCR repertoire. We next examined only the TCR sequences that
were common between all of the time points for each group
and found that a greater proportion of TCR sequences remained
unchanged at week 2 and week 4 in the healthy donors (52.2%
and 52.4%, respectively) compared with sipuleucel-T–treated
subjects (46.7% and 45.9%, respectively; Fig. 3B). In addition,
there was a higher proportion of TCR sequences that increased
at week 2 and week 4 in the sipuleucel-T–treated subjects
(40.3% and 40.5%, respectively) compared with the healthy
donors (27.1% and 23.8%, respectively; Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data demonstrate a greater degree of change over time
in the TCR sequences isolated from sipuleucel-T–treated
subjects.

Assessments of unique TCR sequences in the blood for healthy donors and for

preparation of each sipuleucel-T treatment. A, TCR sequence proﬁles in
healthy donors and sipuleucel-T–treated subjects with prostate cancer over

productive TCR sequences at baseline (week 0) compared with week 2 and
week 4 (P < 0.01, paired t test on the log scale). No differences in mean
productive sequences in healthy donors over time were detected. B, Shannon

diversity index of healthy donors (left) and a sipuleucel-T–treated subject at
baseline (week 0) and weeks 2 and 4. TCR sequence diversity was higher in
sipuleucel-T–treated subjects compared with healthy donors. Shannon
diversity index decreased at weeks 2 and 4 compared with baseline in
sipuleucel-T–treated subjects (P < 0.001), whereas Shannon diversity index
remained stable over time in healthy donors.

The incidence of the 100 most frequent TCR sequences at each
time point in peripheral blood samples from both healthy donors
and sipuleucel-T–treated subjects with prostate cancer was compared to determine whether there were changes in sequence
frequency over time and/or following sipuleucel-T treatment. In
the healthy donor samples, very little change in sequence incidence was observed over time (Fig. 4A). In contrast, samples from
the sipuleucel-T–treated subject demonstrated a considerable
enrichment of certain sequences, with up to a 1,000-fold increase.
To quantify the relative change in sequence incidence between the
healthy donors and sipuleucel-T–treated subjects, we calculated
the average SDs across all three time points for the 100 most
abundant TCR sequences in each group (Fig. 4B). The extent of the
change in the top 100 most abundant TCR sequences in the blood
of sipuleucel-T–treated subjects with prostate cancer was significantly larger following sipuleucel-T treatment compared with
that observed in healthy donors (Wilcoxon one-sided test, P <
0.02). Although changes were evident in the total TCR repertoire,

3714 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

subjects who received sipuleucel-T treatment demonstrated
marked changes in the 100 most abundant TCR sequences,
whereas healthy donor ranks remained static.
Sipuleucel-T treatment increases the commonality of TCR
sequences present in blood and prostate tissue
We next asked whether the observed changes in TCR sequence
following sipuleucel-T treatment were compartment speciﬁc or
were common to both T cells in the blood and those localized to
the prostate tissue. Using the BUB index as a measure of commonality, we found that in subjects who received sipuleucel-T, the
TCR sequence commonality between circulating T cells and
resected prostate tissue signiﬁcantly increased at week 2 compared
with baseline (week 0; P ¼ 0.01), and this increase was maintained
at week 4 but was not signiﬁcantly increased beyond the commonality observed at week 2 (P ¼ 0.65, week 2 vs. week 4; Fig. 5A).
Because there was no difference in the BUB index between weeks 2
and 4, this suggests that commonality of TCR sequences between
the blood and resected prostate tissue is maintained.
Sipuleucel-T treatment is associated with increased TCR
sequence diversity
We next sought to determine whether sipuleucel-T treatment
increases TCR sequence diversity in the prostate tumor by calculating the Shannon diversity index in resected prostate tissue from
sipuleucel-T–treated and untreated subjects with prostate cancer.
As detected by the Shannon index, the TCR sequence diversity
within the prostate tumor tissue was signiﬁcantly higher in
patients who received sipuleucel-T treatment (all infusions and
6 weeks after Infusion 3), which was not seen in prostate tumor
tissue from untreated patients (Wilcoxon test; P ¼ 0.01; Fig. 5B).

Discussion
One of the hallmarks of cancer is the ability to evade or dampen
immune recognition of tumors (26). As a result, several cancer
vaccines and immunotherapies are being developed to activate
the immune response against tumor cells using peptide-, tumor
cell-, dendritic cell-, virus-, and immunoglobulin-based vaccines
or to reverse negative immune regulatory mechanisms with antiCTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapy (2). Although there has been
extensive interest in developing cancer vaccines, there is still no
clear guidance for how to best measure an effective immune
response in the oncology setting (27, 28). However, NGS has
recently been used in small groups of patients to examine how
immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and ipilimumab affect the peripheral T-cell repertoire (14, 15, 29). These
preliminary investigations provide insights into how these drugs
may work. Therefore, we have used a similar NGS technique to
more deeply characterize both the peripheral and tissue-speciﬁc Tcell responses following neoadjuvant sipuleucel-T therapy, which
has demonstrated a survival beneﬁt in subjects with prostate
cancer.
The proposed mechanism of action for sipuleucel-T involves
the induction of T-cell–mediated immune responses that target
prostate cancer cells (10, 30). We have previously shown that
neoadjuvant sipuleucel-T elicited a systemic antigen-speciﬁc Tcell response and recruited activated effector T cells into the
prostate tumor microenvironment (10). Here, we investigated
the effects of sipuleucel-T therapy on both the circulating T-cell
repertoire and the repertoire of prostate tumor-inﬁltrating T cells.

The results of the current analyses show that subjects with prostate
cancer have greater circulating TCR sequence diversity in the
peripheral blood at baseline compared with healthy donors,
which suggests a preexisting immune recognition of prostate
cancer. We demonstrate that neoadjuvant sipuleucel-T treatment
narrows the diversity of circulating TCR sequences in the blood
compared with baseline. Sipuleucel-T treatment also increases
TCR sequence commonality between blood and resected prostate
tissue and broadens the TCR repertoire within the prostate tissue.
Interestingly, our ﬁndings are in contrast with the narrowing of the
tumor-associated T-cell repertoire reported in patients with
advanced melanoma who received pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1
mAb; ref. 14) and the broadening of the peripheral T-cell repertoire seen in patients who received ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4
mAb) (15). This would be consistent with the different mechanisms at work in immune checkpoint inhibition as compared with
vaccination.
In addition, we have shown that sipuleucel-T treatment induces
substantial changes in the TCR repertoire. We observed a greater
proportion of marked increases and decreases in the TCR repertoire among subjects who received sipuleucel-T treatment, whereas the TCR repertoire in healthy donors was relatively static over

the same time points. Furthermore, we observed a considerable
enrichment of certain sequences among the sipuleucel-T–treated
subjects and very little change in the top 100 TCR sequences in the
healthy donors. These data suggest that sipuleucel-T treatment
induces a large degree of change in TCR sequences and is consistent with a narrowing of T-cell diversity over time.
Our results suggest that the narrowing of T-cell diversity in the
blood following the ﬁrst infusion of sipuleucel-T is a result of an
expansion of T-cell clones speciﬁc for antigens associated with
prostate cancer, as may be expected with a cancer vaccine. However, comparison of prostate cancer tissue of treated subjects
to that of untreated subjects shows an unexpected increase in the
T-cell diversity in the prostate cancer tissue of sipuleucel-T–treated
subjects. The greater intratumoral T-cell diversity in the sipuleucelT–treated subjects suggests a clear treatment effect. Taken together,
the narrowing of circulating TCR sequences and the increase in
TCR sequence commonality between blood and prostate tissue
suggest that speciﬁc T-cell clones are recruited from the peripheral
blood to the prostate tumor microenvironment. The current
analyses support and extend our previous data showing that

Change in abundance of TCR sequences during sipuleucel-T treatment. A, a ladder plot of the change in rank of the top 100 sequences at each time point during
the course of treatment for representative examples of one healthy donor and one sipuleucel-T–treated subject. B, the SDs of the selected top 100 sequences
were averaged for each sample across the three time points. For sequences with missing data points, the lower value observed in the same sample was
imputed. The extent of rank shufﬂing of nucleotides is much greater in the sipuleucel-T–treated subjects compared with the healthy donors (P < 0.02, Wilcoxon
one-sided test).

immune response to prostate-speciﬁc antigens within the tissue is
consistent with priming of new T cells.
We have previously shown that sipuleucel-T engages the
immune system by activating antigen-presenting cells during the
production process and induces long-lived immune responses
after infusion (8). We have previously reported that after the ﬁrst
infusion of sipuleucel-T, cytokines known to facilitate T-cell
expansion (IL2, TNFa, and IFNg) were evident in abundant levels
in the culture medium when making the second product (8).
Available data indicate that sipuleucel-T prolongs patient survival

through antigen-speciﬁc immune activation (8). Data from the
metastatic prostate cancer setting suggest that sipuleucel-T
induces humoral antigen spread (31). The current analysis takes
this understanding one step further and demonstrates an inverse
association between T-cell repertoire dynamics in the periphery
and those within prostate cancer tissue. This inverse relationship,
and the simultaneous enrichment of TCR clones common to the
periphery and the prostate cancer tissue, suggests that prostate
antigen-speciﬁc T cells from the peripheral blood may have been
recruited to the prostate and may be recognizing other antigens

week 2 compared with week 0 (P ¼ 0.01, Wilcoxon test). B, the Shannon diversity index of the TCR repertoire in resected prostate tissue samples from untreated and
sipuleucel-T–treated subjects. TCR results were quantiﬁed globally across the biopsy/postsurgical tissue. The horizontal lines represent the median value
of the Shannon diversity index across the available samples for each group of subjects. Resected prostate tissues from sipuleucel-T–treated subjects with prostate
cancer had a signiﬁcantly greater Shannon diversity index compared with resected prostate tissues from subjects with prostate cancer who did not
receive sipuleucel-T (P ¼ 0.01, Wilcoxon test). This represents an increase in T-cell sequence diversity in the prostate among sipuleucel-T–treated subjects.

T-cell Clonotype Change with Sipuleucel-T Treatment

released by a local cascading immune response (i.e., epitope
spreading), thereby expanding the T-cell sequence diversity within the prostate. This broadening of T-cell responses may reﬂect
processes similar to those seen in the immune response to
infectious disease vaccinations (32–34). However, the speciﬁcity
and type of T cells recruited to the prostate tissue remain unknown
at this time. Taken together with our previous data (10), the
current analyses suggest that sipuleucel-T increases the diversity of
T cells within the prostate tumor, which could enhance immunologic containment of the tumor. This idea is consistent with
observations in clinical trials of other prostate cancer vaccines and
immunotherapies (35). Furthermore, our data demonstrate that
sipuleucel-T therapy helps to establish a tumor-homing immune
response. Regimens using sipuleucel-T in combination with other
treatments that augment T-cell immunity, such as ipilimumab
and PD-1/PD-L1–targeted therapies, could further increase clinical beneﬁt (3).
The interpretation of these results is limited by the small sample
number of sipuleucel-T–treated subjects with matched pre- and
posttreatment peripheral blood samples and prostate cancer
tissue on which extensive NGS analysis was performed. However,
the optimal sample size has not yet been established for these
types of analyses. Nevertheless, because of the sensitivity of the
assays, these initial results have provided insight into the speciﬁc
mechanism of action of neoadjuvant sipuleucel-T and are
believed to be representative of the expected immune response
in the larger population of subjects receiving neoadjuvant therapy
for local prostate cancer in the NeoACT study. Other limitations,
as stated previously (10), include the short time between sipuleucel-T therapy and radical prostatectomy (i.e., single tissue
extraction), which does not allow for an adequate longitudinal
evaluation of change in T-cell sequences within the prostate tissue,
and the fact that the effects of neoadjuvant sipuleucel-T therapy on
immune response may not be representative of what occurs
during therapy for advanced metastatic disease.
The ﬁndings derived from these analyses are meant to generate
hypotheses and should be expanded upon with additional studies. Our results highlight the importance of assessing immune
responses in both blood and tissue and suggest that evaluating
immunotherapies based on TCR sequence changes in the blood
alone is likely not sufﬁcient to understand the effects of immunotherapy on tumor tissue. Further studies are needed to identify

the antigens associated with prostate cancer that are recognized
through a sipuleucel-T–induced immune response and may help
to identify biomarkers of clinical outcome for sipuleucel-T
therapy.
