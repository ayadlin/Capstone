Abstract
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family has been
implicated in several cancers, including breast, and its
members have become the target of novel cancer therapies.
In this report, we show a novel link between erlotinib, a potent
EGFR inhibitor, DNA damage, and homology-directed recombinational repair (HDR) in human breast cancer cells.
Erlotinib suppresses HDR. This is not secondary to erlotinibmediated changes in cell cycle and is associated with
increased ;-H2AX foci, which is an in situ marker of
chromosomal double-strand breaks. Both Rad51 and BRCA1
are essential components of the HDR machinery. Consistent
with decreased HDR in erlotinib-treated cells, erlotinib also
attenuates DNA damage-induced Rad51 foci and results in
cytoplasmic retention of BRCA1. As BRCA1 is a shuttling
protein and its nuclear function of promoting HDR is
controlled by its subcellular localization, we further show
that targeted translocation of BRCA1 to the cytoplasm
enhances erlotinib sensitivity. These findings suggest a novel
mechanism of action of erlotinib through its effects on the
BRCA1/HDR pathway. Furthermore, BRCA1/HDR status may
be an innovative avenue to enhance the sensitivity of cancer
cells to erlotinib. [Cancer Res 2008;68(22):9141–6]

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family plays an
essential role in modulating proliferation, differentiation, and
survival and has become a heavily targeted novel cancer
therapeutic strategy (1). Aberrant expression and dysregulation of
any EGFR can be found in several cancers, including lung,
pancreas, head and neck, brain, and breast (1). In approximately
20% to 30% of breast cancers, overexpression of HER2/ErbB2 is
seen and portends a more aggressive phenotype and poorer
prognosis (1). However, with the development of molecular
targeted therapies against HER2, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin),
improved outcomes are being achieved. This success has initiated
the pursuit of other compounds that can suppress HER2 activity. In
particular, drugs that inhibit EGFR subtype HER1 are active against

HER2 (2, 3). One such drug is erlotinib (Tarceva), an orally
bioavailable small molecular weight inhibitor of HER1.
Erlotinib treatment results in blockade of multiple signal
transduction pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival.
In particular, erlotinib has been shown to inhibit growth and cause
cells to accumulate in the G1 phase with a concomitant decrease in
S phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, erlotinib also decreases
radiation-induced Rad51 expression and enhances radiationinduced apoptosis, suggesting a potential role of erlotinib in
altering the DNA damage response (4). Similarly, gefitinib, a
selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been reported to elicit
radiosensitization by suppressing cellular capacity to repair
radiation-induced DNA damage (5). Furthermore, blockade of
EGFR signaling with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to the EGFR
can inhibit radiation-induced activation of DNA-dependent protein
kinase (DNA-PK) and increase radiosensitivity of treated cells (6).
These studies thus support a role of EGFR in the DNA damage
response.
The DNA damage response is commonly triggered on
generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), which can be
repaired via two principal pathways: homology-directed recombinational repair (HDR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ;
refs. 7, 8). NHEJ, which occurs in all phases of the cell cycle, is an
error-prone process that rejoins the ends of DSB with no or few
homology. In contrast, HDR predominantly takes place in S phase
of the cell cycle and is a high-fidelity process that requires an
intact homologous DNA sequence as the template. Multiple
proteins, including the Rad51 recombinase and BRCA1, are
involved in this intricate process. Rad51 catalyzes the DNA
strand invasion and exchange reaction in HDR, whereas BRCA1
promotes HDR through mechanisms involving chromatin remodeling and controlling the function of several other HDR proteins
through protein-protein interactions (7). Recent studies also show
that the function of BRCA1 in DNA repair is regulated by its
nuclear shuttling (9).
In this study, we investigated the effects of erlotinib on DNA
damage and repair in human breast cancer cells. We show for the
first time that erlotinib treatment itself results in decreased HDR
events and increased chromosomal DSBs in human breast cancer
cells. Consistent with decreased HDR, DNA damage-induced Rad51
foci are attenuated by erlotinib. As the function of BRCA1 in
promoting HDR-mediated DSB repair is dependent on its nuclear
localization, we also find that erlotinib reduces nuclear BRCA1
levels with a concomitant sequestration of BRCA1 to the cytosol. It
is worth to note that these effects are not indirect events due to
erlotinib-mediated cell cycle changes. Furthermore, we show that
targeted translocation of BRCA1 to the cytoplasm in breast cancer
cells enhances erlotinib-mediated cytotoxicity. Taken together,
these novel findings suggest that, in addition to its effects on cell
cycle, the action of erlotinib may also involve BRCA1 and the HDR
machinery.

Materials and Methods
DRGFP

Cell culture. Previously established MCF7
cells (9), which were
kindly provided by Dr. Simon Powell (Washington University School of
Medicine, St. Louis, MO), were maintained as previously described.
MCF7DRGFP cells carry a chromosomally integrated HDR substrate. All
transfections were performed using FuGene6 according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Roche).
Immunofluorescence. MCF7DRGFP cells were cultured and mounted
onto sterile glass slides. Cells were then treated with DMSO vehicle, 1 Amol/L
erlotinib, 4 Gy radiation, or 1 Amol/L erlotinib followed by 4 Gy radiation.
Following the treatment period, immunohistochemistry was performed as
previously described (9). Primary antibodies include 200 Ag/AL mouse antiphospho-g-H2AX antibody (Upstate), rabbit anti-Rad51 antibody (1:500;
Calbiochem), or mouse anti-BRCA1 (1:100; Ab-1; mouse mAb MS110;
Calbiochem). Secondary antibodies include anti-mouse Alexa Fluor
488–conjugated antibody (1:1,000; Molecular Probes) or anti-rabbit Alexa
Fluor 594–conjugated antibody (1:1,000; Molecular Probes). Staining
patterns were visualized via fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss). A total
of 50 cells were counted per field, and a total of 10 fields were assessed. For
foci analysis, cells with >10 foci were counted. For BRCA1 localization, cells
were assessed as having nuclear staining only, cytoplasmic staining only, or
both nuclear/cytoplasmic staining (8).
Chromosomal HDR analysis. HDR was assessed as previously described
(10). Briefly, MCF7DRGFP cells were treated with either DMSO vehicle,
1 Amol/L erlotinib, or 6 Amol/L erlotinib for 16 h. Two days after
transfection with I-SceI expression plasmid or empty vector (total exposure
to erlotinib for 64 h), cells were subjected to two-color fluorescence analysis,
which revealed the percentage of green fluorescent cells relative to the total
cell number. For each analysis, 100,000 cells were processed. All transfections were performed using FuGene6.
Cell cycle analysis. MCF7DRGFP cells were treated with DMSO vehicle,
1 Amol/L erlotinib, or 6 Amol/L erlotinib or serum starved for the indicated
times. Following the treatment period, cell cycle distribution was
determined using standard ethanol fixation and propidium iodide staining
followed by flow cytometry as previously described (10).
Clonogenic survival assay. The colony-forming ability was evaluated in
MCF7DRGFP cells transiently expressing either vector control or a peptide
containing truncated BRCA1 (trBRCA1), which has been shown to
effectively shift BRCA1 to the cytoplasm (11). Briefly, cells were transfected
with either vector control or trBRCA1. Twenty-four hours after transfection,
cells were subjected to the treatment with either DMSO or the indicated

dose of erlotinib. Colonies were stained and counted as positive if >50 cells
were seen. Survival fraction was calculated as follows: (number of colonies
for erlotinib/number of cells plated)/(number of colonies for corresponding
control/number of cells plated).
Statistical analysis. The data were analyzed via either t test (HDR
analysis) or ANOVA followed by a Bonferroni post test (remaining data)
using GraphPad Prism version 4.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software).

Results
Erlotinib increases ;-H2AX foci. The downstream actions
of erlotinib are mediated by inhibition of the mitogen-activated
protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways.
As these effects can result in altered expression and localization
of proteins involved in the DNA damage response and enhance
ionizing radiation–induced cytotoxicity (4–6, 12, 13), we investigated whether erlotinib alone can increase nuclear g-H2AX foci,
markers of DNA DSBs in the breast cancer cell line MCF7DRGFP
derived from the well-established MCF7 cell line and carries a
single copy of a chromosomally integrated HDR substrate (10).
As seen in Fig. 1, treatment of MCF7DRGFP cells for 16 hours
with 1 Amol/L erlotinib leads to a 5-fold increase (15% versus 3%;
P < 0.001) in g-H2AX foci compared with vehicle-treated cells. Foci
can also be seen in 40% of cells 30 minutes following exposure to
radiation, which is a potent inducer of DNA DSB and g-H2AX foci.
The combination of erlotinib and radiation enhances g-H2AX foci
compared with radiation alone (48% versus 40%; P < 0.01).
Consistent with previous reports (4–6), these results further
substantiate a link between EGFR inhibition and the DNA damage
response.
Erlotinib decreases HDR. As a result of increased DNA DSB,
cells trigger DNA damage checkpoints and activate the DNA repair
machinery (9, 14). Because erlotinib increases g-H2AX foci, which
are indicative of DNA DSBs, and has been previously shown to
decrease the expression of the HDR protein Rad51 after radiation,
we investigated the effects of erlotinib on cellular capacity to repair
DSBs via HDR. In these experiments, site-specific chromosomal
DSBs were induced in MCF7DRGFP cells by the transient expression
of the I-SceI endonuclease. Only HDR using the homology between

Erlotinib Attenuates Homology-Directed Recombination

Figure 2. Effects of erlotinib on HDR events (A) and cell cycle distribution (B). A, MCF7DRGFP cells were treated for 16 h with DMSO vehicle or 1 Amol/L erlotinib
followed by transfection of a PI-Sce I or control vector. After 48 h, cells were harvested for GFP expression analysis via flow cytometry. Cells were exposed to erlotinib
for a total of 64 h. B, cell cycle distribution was analyzed 24 to 72 h after 1 Amol/L of erlotinib treatment or serum starvation as a positive control for G1 accumulation.

the two mutated founder green fluorescent protein (GFP) repeats
can restore GFP function. Expression of GFP in these cells was then
quantified using flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2A, 1 Amol/L
erlotinib significantly decreases the percentage of GFP-positive
cells compared with control cells (0.63% versus 0.3%; P < 0.001),
resulting in a 2-fold decrease in HDR efficiency. This concentration
of erlotinib has been shown to induce cytotoxic effects in breast
cancer cells and correspond to clinically relevant doses (15). In
addition, these HDR effects are not due to differences in cell
viability or transfection efficiency, which are included as controls in
all HDR assays.
It is known that one of the mechanisms for erlotinib-mediated
cytotoxicity is via induced accumulation of cells at the G1 phase of
cell cycle with a concomitant decrease of cells in S and G2-M
phases. Given that HDR predominantly takes place in S phase when
DNA replication occurs, we next examined whether our observed
decrease in HDR by erlotinib is an indirect result of erlotinibmediated changes in cell cycle, such as a dramatic reduction of
cells in S-phase or accumulation in G1 phase. When analyzed at 24,
48, and 72 hours following 1 Amol/L erlotinib treatment, there is no
significant decrease of cells in S phase or accumulation of cells in
G1 phase (Fig. 2B) to account for the erlotinib-mediated 2-fold
decrease in HDR. However, in agreement with previous reports,
6 Amol/L erlotinib robustly induces a significant G1 accumulation
similar to that of serum starvation as early as 24 hours (46% cells in
G1; Supplementary Fig. S1A). These observations suggest that the
effects of erlotinib may involve the down-regulation of HDR and
are not secondary to erlotinib-mediated cell cycle effects.

Erlotinib attenuates radiation-induced Rad51 foci and
sequesters BRCA1 in the cytoplasm. To further explore
erlotinib-mediated decrease in HDR, we investigated Rad51 foci,
a well-characterized in vivo functional marker of HDR.
MCF7DRGFP cells were exposed to 1 Amol/L erlotinib for 16
hours, and Rad51 foci were examined. As seen in Fig. 3A, erlotinib
alone does not significantly affect Rad51 foci (11% versus 12%).
However, the sensitivity of this assay may not be sufficient to
detect erlotinib-mediated effects on Rad51 foci. To amplify
this DNA damage response as well as to obtain a reference
control, radiation was used, which results in robust induction of
Rad51 foci (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the decreased HDR seen
with erlotinib, radiation-induced Rad51 foci are significantly
attenuated by erlotinib (51% versus 35% of cells; P < 0.001). This
agrees with previously observed reduction of radiation-induced
Rad51 expression by erlotinib in human lung and head and neck
cancers (4).
BRCA1 plays a critical role in the DNA damage response
pathway and promotes error-free HDR. Recent studies show that
BRCA1 is a shuttling protein, which is retained in the nucleus
during S phase and accumulates in the cytosol during mitosis (9).
In response to radiation-induced DNA damage, nuclear export of
BRCA1 to the cytoplasm is observed in a p53-dependent manner
(9). Specifically, the functions of BRCA1 in promoting HDR are
dictated by its nuclear localization (9, 16). We thus sought to
determine whether the effects of erlotinib on HDR inhibition
involve changes in BRCA1 localization, which controls its nuclear
function of repair. MCF7DRGFP cells with functional p53 exhibit

a robust radiation-induced BRCA1 cytoplasmic translocation
(Fig. 3B), which is consistent with previous reports (9). Interestingly, after 16 hours of 1 Amol/L erlotinib treatment, a significant
cytoplasmic shift of BRCA1 is observed in MCF7DRGFP cells when
compared with untreated cells (25% versus 10%; P < 0.001; Fig. 3B).
It is worth to note that there is no cell cycle effect observed from
erlotinib at this time and dose (Fig. 2B). With the combination of
erlotinib and radiation, this effect is further enhanced (51% versus
75% of cells; P < 0.001 versus radiation alone). These findings
suggest a potential link between erlotinib-mediated effects on
BRCA1 localization and down-regulation of HDR.
Nuclear repair function of BRCA1 is critical for sensitivity to
erlotinib. Given that the critical function of nuclear BRCA1
involves promoting HDR-mediated repair of DSB, we next assessed
the role of BRCA1 in erlotinib-mediated cytotoxic effects. As HDR
depends on BRCA1 nuclear localization, we reasoned that
depletion of nuclear BRCA1 would inhibit HDR and thus augment
the cytotoxic actions of erlotinib through HDR suppression. To
achieve this, we used a peptide containing trBRCA1, which
contains the BRCA1 nuclear export sequence and BARD1 binding
domain and has been shown to effectively shift BRCA1 to the
cytoplasm (11, 16). Ectopic expression of trBRCA1 in MCF7 cells
results in a 2-fold reduction (40% versus 20%) in nuclear BRCA1
(Fig. 4A) and 10-fold inhibition (0.33% versus 0.03%) of HDR
activity (Fig. 4B).
Having established that trBRCA1 can deplete nuclear BRCA1 and
inhibit HDR capacity, we next assessed the effect of altering BRCA1
localization (and hence HDR) on erlotinib-mediated cytotoxicity.
trBRCA1 was transiently expressed in MCF7 cells. Twenty-four
hours after transfection, cells were treated with erlotinib for
72 hours, and clonogenic survival following erlotinib treatment was
assessed. As shown in Fig. 4C, 1 Amol/L erlotinib induces a cytoxic
effect. Furthermore, targeted translocation of BRCA1 to the cytosol

enhances this cytotoxic response of MCF7DRGFP breast cancer cells
to erlotinib. We also examined the cytotoxic effect of a higher dose
(6 Amol/L) of erlotinib, which induces more than 4-fold decrease of
HDR (Supplementary Fig. S1B) and 2-fold increased accumulation
of cells in G1 phase (Supplementary Fig. S1A). As seen in Fig. 4C,
the survival fraction of cells at this concentration is reduced
compared with 1 Amol/L, likely due to the combined effects of
erlotinib-mediated cell cycle redistribution and suppression of
HDR at 6 Amol/L. Interestingly, an enhanced cytotoxicity by
erlotinib continues to be observed following BRCA1 translocation
to the cytosol (and hence reduced HDR) by trBRCA1. Together, our
findings in this study suggest a potential role for the BRCA1-HDR
pathway in the cytotoxic effects of erlotinib beyond its cell cycle
effects.

Discussion
In this study, we show that erlotinib treatment of human
breast cancer cells results in suppression of HDR and increased
basal levels of g-H2AX foci, which are indicative of accumulation
of DNA DSBs. Inhibition of HDR is also associated with
sequestration of BRCA1 to the cytoplasm and attenuation of
DNA damage-induced Rad51 foci but is not an indirect result of
erlotinib-mediated cell cycle effects. Furthermore, disruption
of the repair function by targeted translocation of BRCA1 to
the cytoplasm enhances erlotinib-mediated cytotoxicity. These
findings suggest a novel link between erlotinib-mediated
cytotoxicity, DNA damage, and the HDR machinery in human
breast cancer cells.
HDR is a complex process that is intricately tied to the cell cycle.
We and others have previously reported a dependence of HDR and
HDR protein subcellular localization on cell cycle distribution (9).
Because erlotinib has been reported to induce G1 accumulation (4),

Figure 4. Nuclear repair function of BRCA1 is critical for sensitivity to erlotinib.
A, trBRCA1 drives BRCA1 to the cytoplasm. Twenty-four hours following
transient transfection of trBRCA1 or control vector, MCF7 cells were subjected to
immunohistochemical analysis for BRCA1. BRCA1 localization was scored
as strictly nuclear (N ), strictly cytoplasmic (C ), or both nuclear and cytoplasmic
(N/C ; inset of Fig. 3B). B, expression of trBRCA1 suppresses DNA

erlotinib-mediated cytotoxicity. MCF7 cells transiently expressing either control

changing BRCA1 localization. Thus, the erlotinib-mediated reduction of HDR seems to be independent of, and in addition to, the cell
cycle effects of erlotinib.
Recent reports suggest that sensitivity to erlotinib is dependent
on regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway,
which can alter the DNA damage response (17). Downstream Akt
targets, such as the FoxO subfamily of forkhead transcription
factors and MDM2, have been shown to stimulate the DNA damage
and repair pathways (12, 13). In addition, radiation-induced Rad51
expression is reduced following erlotinib exposure in human lung
and head and neck cancers (4).
Our results indicate that the underlying mechanisms by which
erlotinib down-regulates HDR may involve BRCA1. Recent studies
have shown that BRCA1 function is dictated by its subcellular
localization (9, 16). In particular, BRCA1-mediated HDR occurs in
the nucleus (16). We find that after 16 hours of erlotinib
treatment, a time at which no significant changes in cell cycle are
observed, nuclear BRCA1 levels are reduced. This suggests that
erlotinib-mediated suppression of HDR may occur at least in part
via sequestration of BRCA1 in the cytoplasm. Consistent with this
notion is that forced shift of BRCA1 to the cytoplasm enhances
erlotinib-mediated cytotoxicity in BRCA1-expressing cells. Alternatively, erlotinib may cause DSBs, which could induce BRCA1
cytoplasmic redistribution similar to our previous report of
radiation-induced BRCA1 nuclear export (9). This change in
BRCA1 localization would then alter HDR capacity such that
erlotinib-induced DSBs cannot be repaired and thus lead to
cytotoxicity.
Inhibition of EGFR signaling has also been implicated in
radiation-induced activation of the DNA damage response.
Radiation-induced nuclear import of the EGFR has been
associated with induction of DNA-PK–dependent repair of DSBs
through NHEJ, and blockade of EGFR with a mAb prevents this
activation leading to radiosensitization (6). It is possible that
erlotinib may also have effects on the NHEJ DNA repair pathway.
Our preliminary studies do not show a significant difference in
erlotinib-mediated activation of DNA-PK foci (data not shown).
However, further in-depth investigation is warranted to determine
if erlotinib affects NHEJ.
In summary, our findings indicate that the cytotoxic effects of
erlotinib occur, in part, via down-regulation of HDR and
sequestration of BRCA1 to the cytoplasm away from its role in
HDR in the nucleus. This is not secondary to erlotinib-mediated
cell cycle effects. Furthermore, targeting of BRCA1 away from the
nucleus enhances erlotinib-mediated cytotoxicity. These results
suggest the potential use of BRCA1/HDR status as a molecular
marker to predict patient response to erlotinib. Additionally, the
BRCA1/HDR pathway may be a potential target to sensitize cancer
cells to erlotinib.

Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest
it is important that the effect on HDR by erlotinib is not secondary
to erlotinib-mediated changes in cell cycle distribution. As shown
in Fig. 2B, low doses (1 Amol/L) of erlotinib do not result in
significant changes in cell cycle distribution, specifically no S-phase
reduction, to account for a 2-fold reduction in HDR capacity. In
addition, higher doses of erlotinib (6 Amol/L) robustly induce G1
accumulation at similar magnitudes as serum starvation as early as
24 hours following treatment. However, a further enhanced
cytotoxicity can still be observed by manipulation of HDR through
