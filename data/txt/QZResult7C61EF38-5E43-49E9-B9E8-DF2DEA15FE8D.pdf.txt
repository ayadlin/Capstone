Abstract
Hormones and growth factors regulate endometrial cell
growth. Disrupted transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B)
signaling in primary endometrial carcinoma (ECA) cells leads
to loss of TGF-B–mediated growth inhibition, which we show
herein results in lack of up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 (p27) to arrest cells in G1 phase of
the cell cycle. Conversely, in normal primary endometrial
epithelial cells (EECs), TGF-B induces a dose-dependent
increase in p27 protein, with a total 3.6-fold maximal increase
at 100 pmol/L TGF-B, which was 2-fold higher in the nuclear
fraction; mRNA levels were unaffected. In addition, ECA tissue
lysates show a high rate of ubiquitin-mediated degradation
of p27 compared with normal secretory-phase endometrial
tissue (SE) such that 4% and 89% of recombinant p27 added to
the lysates remains after 3 and 20 h, respectively. These results
are reflected in vivo as ECA tissue lacks p27 compared with
high expression of p27 in SE (P V 0.001). Furthermore, we
show that estrogen treatment of EECs causes mitogenactivated protein kinase–driven proteasomal degradation of
p27 whereas progesterone induces a marked increase in p27 in
both normal EECs and ECA cells. Therefore, these data suggest
that TGF-B induces accumulation of p27 for normal growth
regulation of EECs. However, in ECA, in addition to enhanced
proteasomal degradation of p27, TGF-B cannot induce p27
levels due to dysregulated TGF-B signaling, thereby causing
17B-estradiol–driven p27 degradation to proceed unchecked
for cell cycle progression. Thus, p27 may be a central target for
growth regulation of normal endometrium and in the
pathogenesis of ECA. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1007–18]

Introduction
Transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h), a potent inhibitor of cell
growth, functions paradoxically in many human cancers (1, 2).
Whereas disruption of TGF-h signaling is a means by which cancer
cells subvert growth inhibition, similar TGF-h–mediated signaling

pathways have been shown to mediate metastasis later in
malignant progression. Thus, although inhibitors of TGF-h
signaling may have potential therapeutic value to prevent
metastasis, the initial loss of TGF-h–mediated growth inhibition
is related to the development of many human cancers and thus,
components of the TGF-h signaling pathway are considered as
tumor suppressors (3). Related to this important function of
TGF-h, we showed in a previous report that disruption of TGF-h
signaling is an early event leading to loss of TGF-h–mediated
growth inhibition in primary cultures of carcinoma cells isolated
from type I endometrial cancer tissue, suggesting a role in the
pathogenesis of endometrial carcinoma (ECA; ref. 4). ECA is the
most common gynecologic malignancy. Endometrioid type I occurs
at a rate of 85% and is caused by unopposed estrogen, which
induces hyperplasia, often a precursor to carcinoma in this cancer
(5–7). The growth of endometrial glandular epithelium is responsive to many growth factors and to gonadal steroids in a cyclical
manner. Normally, within the menstrual cycle, estrogen stimulates
proliferation of endometrial epithelium in the ( follicular) proliferative phase, and progesterone, derived from the corpus luteum,
inhibits epithelial growth and induces glandular differentiation in
the (luteal) secretory phase. Accordingly, progestins are used to
treat both endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma (8).
Cellular proliferation is accomplished by different cell cycle
phase–dependent cyclins complexed to specific cyclin-dependent
kinases (cdk) that progressively and additively phosphorylate Rb
(and other pocket proteins, p130 and p107) for cell cycle
progression (9), dictated by a complex network of interactions of
pocket proteins with E2F transcription factors and specific gene
activation (10, 11). TGF-h decreases specific cdks and increases
certain cdk inhibitors to maintain Rb in a hypophosphorylated
state to block cell cycle progression in late G1 phase. The regulation
of TGF-h activity is cell type and context dependent and classically
involves the cooperation of two serine/threonine kinase receptors,
ThRI and ThRII, which directly phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3,
which are transcription factors for activation of genes involved in
growth inhibition and other TGF-h–related functions (3, 12). p27,
originally isolated from TGF-h–treated growth arrested cells (13),
has a dual role in regulating the cell cycle as it is critical to the
formation of cyclin D/cdk2 complexes for phosphorylation of Rb
but prevents further phosphorylation of Rb by binding to cyclin E/
cdk2 and cyclin A/cdk2 for cell cycle arrest in G1 (14). Intracellular
levels of p27 are highly regulated by posttranslational mechanisms
that control its ubiquitin-mediated degradation and nuclear
exclusion (15–20). The significance of maintaining sufficient
nuclear levels of p27 to block cdk2 for normal growth inhibition
is underscored by the complexity of cellular mechanisms and
pathways affecting p27 levels that can go awry to promote the
growth of cancer cells (16, 17). Whereas there is no compelling

evidence for p27 as a classic tumor suppressor, genetically null
mice develop pituitary hyperplasia and are predisposed to tumor
formation by DNA-damaging agents (21). Importantly, mutations in
the p27 gene are rare in human cancers (22). Instead, decreased
nuclear levels of p27 by proteasomal degradation and cytoplasmic
mislocalization of p27 are found in many human cancers (16, 17,
20, 23, 24).

Both 17h-estradiol (E2) and progestins, as well as their receptor
agonists and antagonists, regulate the growth of female hormoneregulated organs. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro data show that
E2 plays a critical role in the development of breast cancer and
unopposed E2 is touted as the sole etiologic agent in type I ECA
(6, 7). Both estrogens and progestins have been shown to affect the
levels, cellular localization, and cell cycle binding partners of p27

Regulation of p27Kip1 by TGF-b, Estrogen, and Progesterone

(25, 26) and the association of cdk inhibitors with cyclin/cdk
complexes in breast cancer cells (27). However, little is known
about the mechanisms involved in hormone effects on p27 in the
endometrium.
Because p27 blocks cell cycle progression and is isolated from
TGF-h–treated cells, we sought to determine whether TGF-h
signaling could directly affect the levels of p27 in normal
endometrial cells and whether the lack of p27 induction resulting
from disrupted TGF-h signaling may be a mechanism involved in
endometrial carcinogenesis. We show herein that whereas TGF-h
does not affect mRNA levels in both endometrial tissue–derived
primary cultures of normal endometrial epithelial (EECs) and
carcinoma (ECA) cells, it induces a dose-dependent accumulation
of p27 protein in the normal cells in both the cytoplasm and
nucleus, with a 2-fold greater increase in the nuclear fraction.
However, p27 protein is negligible and not induced by TGF-h in the
carcinoma cells lacking TGF-h signaling. In addition, malignant
endometrial tissue lysates rapidly degrade exogenously added p27
via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These results suggest that
both loss of TGF-h signaling and increased proteasomal degradation of p27 are important molecular events involved in pathologic
growth of the endometrium. We further show that addition of E2 to
normal EECs induces mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–
driven ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of p27 and

that progesterone increases p27 protein levels in both normal and
malignant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that the effects
of TGF-h and ovarian hormones converge on the regulation of the
levels of the cdk inhibitor p27 to control endometrial cell growth.

Materials and Methods
Isolation and culture of EECs and ECA cells. Fresh endometrial
tissues from type I endometrioid tumors derived from hysterectomies
(women ages 35–55 years) at New York University-Tisch and Bellevue
Hospitals were placed in iced phenol red–free McCoy’s 5A medium (SigmaAldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO) and primary cell cultures initiated within 4 h.
Endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma (ECA) samples were identified and
graded by at least two surgical pathologists according to the WHO system
[grades I–III, for decreased glandular architecture (Fédération Internationale des Gynaecologistes et Obstetristes system: upper number) and for
nuclear atypia (lower number); ref. 28]. Normal endometrial tissue
[proliferative phase (PE) and secretory phase (SE)] was obtained from
non-cancer-related hysterectomies, generally leiomyomas. Tissue lysates
were prepared by freezing and thawing or by disruption with a nitrogen
bomb (Parr, Moline, IL), and tissue samples were fixed in 10% buffered
formalin for 24 h and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry. All
studies involving human subjects were approved by the New York University
School of Medicine Institutional Review Board (Assurance of Compliance
no. M1177-01). To prepare primary cell cultures, EECs and ECA cells were
isolated as described (4). The EECs and ECA cells, seeded at 3  106 to

Figure 1. Analysis of p27 mRNA, protein levels, and subcellular distribution following TGF-h treatment of EECs and ECA cells. Primary EECs and ECA cells were
isolated from fresh endometrial tissue (PE, SE, inactive endometrium, hyperplasia, and ECA) and seeded onto Primaria 60-mm plates. Twenty-four hours later or
when the cells reached 60% to 70% confluency, the cells were incubated in McCoy’s 5A medium containing 2% charcoal-stripped FBS or serum-free media and
treated with recombinant TGF-h1 (0–100 pmol/L) every other day for 4 d. A, TGF-h did not alter basal expression of p27 mRNA levels in EECs or ECA cells.
Total RNA was isolated from the cells as described in Materials and Methods and p27 mRNA levels were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Amplification
of p27 mRNA was done with the following primers and method: p27 primers (accession no. U10906), 5¶-CTTGCCCGAGTTCTACTACAGAC-3¶ (forward) and
5¶-CAAATGCGTGTCCTCAGAGTTAG-3¶ (reverse). The integrity of the RNA was confirmed by amplification of human h-actin mRNA (accession no. NM 001101)
with the following oligonucleotides: 5¶-ATCATGTTTGAGACCTTCAA-3¶ (forward) and 5¶-CATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTCCA-3¶ (reverse). After denaturation for 2 min at
95jC, the cycle profile consisted of 30 s at 94jC, 1 min at 60jC, and 2 min at 72jC for 35 cycles. The primers yield a 142-bp PCR product. p27 mRNA levels are
compared with b-actin as the housekeeping gene. The primary cells were derived from PE (n = 2), SE (n = 2), and ECA (n = 2 grade I/II and n = 2 grade II/II). B, TGF-h
induces a dose-dependent increase in intracellular p27 protein in normal EECs but not in ECA cells. Proteins were extracted from cell cultures with RIPA lysis buffer
containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.137 mol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 3.0 mmol/L EDTA. A mixture of protease
inhibitors was added to final concentrations of 1.0 mmol/L PMSF, 0.15 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, 10 Ag/mL pepstatin, and 5 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate
(all from Sigma). The cell cultures were rocked on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000  g for 15 min at 4jC to clarify the supernatants. Equal protein
concentrations (30 Ag) in Laemmli sample buffer containing 0.1 mol/L DTT were loaded onto SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electrotransferred to Hybond PVDF
membranes for 1 h and the membranes stained with 0.2% Ponceau S (Sigma) to re-ensure equal loading and transfer of proteins. The blots were treated with the
Qentix Western Blot Signal Enhancer to increase the sensitivity of immunoblotting, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 1 h, and incubated with a mouse
monoclonal antibody to p27 (1:400; BD Biosciences) in blocking buffer overnight at 4jC. Finally, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–
conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The SuperSignal WestDura Extended Duration
Substrate kit (Pierce) was used, followed by exposure to X-ray film to detect the protein bands. To ensure equal loading and normalize sample loads for the
estimation of protein levels from densitometry, the blots were stripped with 0.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 100 mmol/L DTT, and 2% SDS at 50jC for 30 min; incubated in
blocking buffer composed of 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h; and then reprobed with a mouse anti–h-actin antibody in 2.5%
nonfat dry milk containing TBST (1:12,000; clone AC15, Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat antimouse secondary antibody (1:2,000;
Pierce) in TBST containing 2.5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Densitometry was done on each h-actin and p27 band and the levels of p27 were quantified following
normalizing the intensity of the p27 signal to the h-actin signal. The graphs (right ) show the protein levels of each blot, represented as fold change from the control
at 0 (Y axis ). Two representative samples of normal endometrium from SE (Normal #1) and from PE (Normal #2), one from hyperplastic tissue, and two representative
samples from ECA (ECA#1 and ECA#2 ), both grade I/III, are shown. The graph (right ) shows the average fold induction from the blots shown of the two normal
samples. The primary EECs used were PE (n = 4) and SE (n = 6). One sample of EECs from inactive endometrium showed similar results. All primary cultures
derived from normal endometrium show a dose-dependent response to TGF-h. In contrast, the one primary culture from hyperplasia and all the ECA primary cells
from patients representing different grades of cancer [i.e., ECA grade I/II (n = 2), ECA grade II/II (n = 2), and ECA grade I/III (n = 2)] have scant to negligible basal
levels of p27 and are not induced by TGF-h. C, TGF-h induces p27 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus with a greater increase in the nuclear fraction compared
at 100 pmol/L TGF-h. Primary cultures of normal EECs were treated with TGF-h as described above and nuclear cytoplasmic fractions prepared using the NE-PER
kit. Following scraping of the cells from plates on ice, the cells were centrifuged at 300  g for 5 min to obtain cell pellets to which the kit reagents were added for
subcellular fractionation. The extracted proteins (5.0 Ag of nuclear fractions and 15 Ag of cytoplasmic fractions) were probed for p27 levels by immunoblotting and
the blots stripped and reprobed for h-actin, as described in (B ). To ensure purity of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, the blots were stripped again and reprobed
with a mouse anti–a-tubulin antibody (1:12,000; clone B-5-1-2, Sigma) in blocking buffer overnight 4jC, as a marker of the cytoplasmic fraction, followed by streptavidin
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated goat antimouse secondary antibody (Pierce) for 1 h. The blots were also probed with a rabbit anti–Sp-1 polyclonal
antibody (1:12,000; H-225, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit antiserum as a marker of the nuclear fraction
(data not shown). The levels of p27, h-actin, and a-tubulin proteins were determined as described in (B ). The levels of p27 were normalized to the values obtained for
h-actin. The lack of a-tubulin in the nuclear fraction indicates the purity of the subcellular fractionation. The graph (right ) depicts the densitometric quantification of
the p27 protein bands normalized to h-actin, represented as fold induction; dotted line, comparison of the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions at 100 pmol/L TGF-h.
TGF-h induction of p27 was observed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions but 2-fold higher in the nuclear fraction, at 100 pmol/L, in the primary EEC culture
from SE shown here. Normal EECs used for these experiments were SE (n = 2) and PE (n = 1). D, novel protein synthesis is required for up-regulation of p27 in
response to TGF-h. EECs were treated with 100 pmol/L TGF-h for 24 h and cycloheximide (CHX ) was added 1 h before termination of the experiment. Cell lysates
were prepared and 20 Ag of protein were analyzed by Western blotting as described in (B). A representative sample of EECs from SE. Similar results were obtained
from EECs derived from SE (n = 2) and inactive endometrium (n = 1). The levels of p27 were determined as described in (B ) and are depicted in the graph (right )
as fold induction.

Figure 2. Immunohistochemical analysis of p27 expression in normal endometrium and type I ECA. A, proliferative phase endometrial glands and ECA tissues
show little to no immunoreactivity with anti-p27. Tissues on slides from normal endometrium, endometrial hyperplasia, and ECA were subjected to antigen retrieval
and immunostained with a monoclonal antibody to p27 using the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit, as described in Materials and Methods. Briefly, the slides were microwaved
(Sharp Electronics, Co., Mahwah, NJ) in Citra solution (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) and boiled gently for 20 min. After cooling, the slides were placed in blocking
buffer containing goat serum for 20 min and then incubated with anti-p27 (0.5 Ag/mL; BD Biosciences) in blocking buffer overnight at 4jC. Preimmune mouse serum (0.5
Ag/mL; Lipshaw Immunon, Pittsburgh, PA) was used as a negative control. Goat antimouse secondary antibody and avidin-biotin complex were applied, as described,
and the brown color reaction was developed using the substrate 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (0.5%; Acros Organics, Morris Plains, NJ). The slides were
counterstained with Gill’s #2 hematoxylin (Fisher). a, PE; b, SE; c, simple hyperplasia without atypia; d, ECA grade I/I and grade III/II. Original magnification,

and ECA) were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric ANOVA test to determine the mean of the ranks. Dunn’s multiple comparison test (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA) was used to estimate P values for statistical significance of the difference in rank sum between each category. The means were considered
statistically significant at P V 0.05. Red bars, median value for each sample category. The number of samples for each category is shown in the graph.

The values for Smad2P [antibody to phosphorylated Smad2 (transcription factor for TGF-h signaling direct phosphorylation/activation by the TGF-h receptor type I)
indicating TGF-h signaling and bioactivity through the Smad pathway] were derived from a previous study using identical patients as used here for p27
immunohistochemistry (4).

Regulation of p27Kip1 by TGF-b, Estrogen, and Progesterone
4  106 per 60-mm Primaria tissue culture plate (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ),
were grown in McCoy’s 5A medium for 24 h or to f70% confluence and
switched to serum-free medium followed by addition of the respective
treatments described below.
Analysis of p27Kip1 mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR. To serumfree primary cell cultures, recombinant TGF-h1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN) at 0, 10, and 100 pmol/L was added every other day for 4 days; the cells
were washed with HBSS (Mediatech, Inc., Hernden, VA); and total RNA was
isolated using RNAZol (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). cDNA was
synthesized from 2.0 Ag of total RNA using the SuperScript II Reverse
Transcriptase Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To amplify human p27 mRNA,
the cDNA corresponding to 20 and 200 ng of total RNA was used with p27
primers (accession no. U10906). The integrity of the RNA was compared
with reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for h-actin (accession no. NM
001101) and the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing.
Cell treatments and Western blot analysis. The serum-free primary
cell cultures were treated in individual experiments with TGF-h (0, 10, and
100 pmol/L), 100 nmol/L E2 (Sigma), 20 Amol/L PD98059 (Calbiochem,
La Jolla, CA), and 100 nmol/L medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate [progesterone (Pg); Sigma], 100 nmol/L ICI 182,780 (Zeneca Limited, Wilmington, DE)
and 10 Amol/L mifepristone (RU-486; #8046, Sigma) every other day for
4 days. In certain experiments, the cells were treated with TGF-h for
24 h and 10 Ag/mL cycloheximide (Sigma) was added 1 h before harvesting
the cells. In specified E2-treated cell cultures, the proteasome inhibitor
lactacystin (1–10 Amol/L; Calbiochem) was added 2.5 h before ending the
experiment. Experiments were terminated with radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) lysis buffer containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma)
and proteins extracted as described in the legend to Fig. 1B. Where noted,
nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from TGF-h–treated cells
using the NE-PER kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL). Protein
concentrations of all cellular supernatant preparations were determined
using the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and
equal amounts of protein (5–40 Ag) were reduced in Laemmli sample buffer
with 0.1 mol/L DTT (Bio-Rad), separated by 5% to 20% SDS-PAGE, and then
transferred to Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes
(Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The procedures used for individual
Western blots are described in the figure legends. The blots were exposed to
BioMax X-ray film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) for protein detection. To
quantify the protein bands, densitometry was done using an EDAS 290 and
Kodak 1D Image Analysis software (Eastman Kodak).
Immunohistochemical analysis for p27Kip1. Tissue sections (4 Am), cut
from newly embedded or archival paraffin blocks of normal endometrium
(PE and SE), hyperplastic endometrium, and different grades of ECA were
obtained from the New York University and Bellevue Tumor Registry.
Immunohistochemistry was done with a monoclonal antibody to p27
(0.5 Ag/mL; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) as previously described (4) and
according to instructions from the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), except antigen retrieval was required to
expose p27 epitopes for immunoreactivity. The intensity of nuclear and/or
cytoplasmic immunostaining for the glandular epithelium and stromal cells
were assessed by three pathologists and scored (immunostaining levels:
0, none; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, intense). The values for intensity of immunostaining were determined and outcome was measured as the product of
average staining intensity and the percentage of cells stained at the
predominant intensity (usually 100%). The values for intensity of immunostaining for each category were determined using the Kruskal-Wallis
nonparametric ANOVA test and P values were estimated using Dunn’s
multiple comparison test.
Proteasome degradation assay. Endometrial tissue lysates were prepared from 50 to 100 mg of pulverized frozen tissue by freezing in liquid
nitrogen and subsequent thawing on ice in 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.3),
5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT containing 100 Ag/mL aprotinin,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 Ag/mL leupeptin,
three separate times. The lysates were clarified at 10,000  g for 10 min;
equal amounts of protein (75–100 Ag) were incubated with 1 Amol/L
histidine–tagged recombinant p27 (rp27; kindly provided by M. Pagano,
New York University School of Medicine, NY; ref. 29) in a degradation buffer

mixture; and the experiments were done as described in the legend to
Fig. 3A. The proteasomes were removed from ECA tissue lysates and hemin
(Sigma) was used to block proteasomes in certain experiments.
Ubiquitylation of p27Kip1. Tissue preparation and ubiquitylation of p27
were done as described (29, 30). Briefly, endometrial tissue (50–75 mg) was
disrupted in lysis buffer, containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 2 mmol/L
DTT, 0.25 mmol/L EDTA, and 10 Ag/mL each of leupeptin and pepstatin,
using a prechilled Parr cell nitrogen bomb apparatus at 1,000 psi on ice for
30 min; lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000  g for 10 min.
rp27 was added to the reaction mixture as the substrate for p27
ubiquitylation and the experiments were done as described in the legend
to Fig. 3D.

Results
TGF-B induces nuclear and cytoplasmic p27Kip1 protein
accumulation in normal EECs but not in ECA cells. The effect
of TGF-h on p27 mRNA and protein levels in primary cultures of
cells derived from normal, hyperplastic, and ECA tissues was
determined using semiquantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting,
respectively. Normal EECs from both PE and SE and carcinoma
cells from all grades of ECA contain basal levels of p27 mRNA,
and none show induction of p27 by 100 pmol/L TGF-h (Fig. 1A).
Whereas the basal levels of p27 protein were variable among the
primary cultures and, generally, p27 was higher in SE, both the SE
(#1) and PE (#2) primary cultures shown here contain moderate
basal levels of p27 protein (Fig. 1B). TGF-h at 10 and 100 pmol/L
induced an average 3- and 3.6-fold increase, respectively, in p27
protein levels in EECs derived from normal SE (#1) and normal
PE (#2) compared with an untreated sample (Fig. 1B). A similar
response was obtained in the presence of 2% charcoal-stripped
fetal bovine serum (FBS; data not shown). In addition, EECs from
one inactive (postmenopausal) endometrial sample responded to
TGF-h (data not shown). By contrast, TGF-h did not increase p27
protein in all grades of ECA assessed, which generally had none
to very low basal levels, as shown here in two grade I/III
carcinomas (Fig. 1B, ECA #1 and #2). Similarly, p27 was not
increased by TGF-h in EECs from one sample of endometrial
hyperplasia (Fig. 1B).
Following subcellular fractionation of normal EECs from both PE
and SE, 78% of basal p27 levels is localized within the nuclear
fraction (Fig. 1C, graph). However, the TGF-h–induced increase in
p27 occurs in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (7.5- and
3.5-fold over basal levels, respectively) with a 2-fold greater increase
in the nucleus at 100 pmol/L TGF-h (Fig. 1C, graph). The
accumulation of p27 partly requires novel protein synthesis
because a 67% reduction (3.8- to 1.26-fold) in p27 protein levels
is obtained when cycloheximide is added 1 h before the
termination of a 24-h incubation with TGF-h (Fig. 1D).
p27Kip1 expression is decreased in ECA cells in vivo.
Consistent with the negligible levels of p27 in primary cultures of
ECA cells (Fig. 1B), we previously showed a paucity of p27 by
immunohistochemistry in the malignant glands in ECA tissue
compared with normal (31). To determine whether p27 expression
differed among various grades of ECA, in premalignant hyperplasia,
and in normal PE compared with SE, tissue samples were analyzed
by immunohistochemistry. As illustrated (Fig. 2), immunoreactivity
ranged from none to slight cytoplasmic staining with some nuclei
staining in the glands of PE (Fig. 2A-a). In contrast, the glands of
SE show strong predominantly nuclear p27 immunoreactivity
(Fig. 2A-b, arrows). The pathology of endometrial cancer is
characterized by proliferation of the epithelium with loss of

glandular architecture, consequential crowding, and eventual
obliteration of the stromal cells with increasing grade. Slight
cytoplasmic immunostaining for p27 was shown in hyperplasia
(simple without atypia shown here; Fig. 2A-c). In marked contrast to
the intense p27 immunoreactivity observed in normal SE (Fig. 2A-b),
there is complete absence of p27 expression in the crowded malignant glands of ECA tissues grade I/I and grade III/II (Fig. 2A-d),
showing complete loss of glandular structure and near absence of
stromal cells. In all hyperplasias examined (n = 7; including simple,
complex without atypia, and complex with atypia histology), p27
was localized to the cytoplasm; the two lowest-grade hyperplasias
(i.e., simple without atypia) showed nuclear staining as well. The
intensity of p27 immunostaining and number of immunoreactive
stromal cells varied among the normal and malignant tissue

samples. The tissue samples were ranked by intensity of p27
immunostaining, shown in the box plots (Fig. 2B). A statistically
significant decrease in p27 immunoreactivity was shown between
ECA and SE (P V 0.001) and between PE and SE (P V 0.02).
Importantly, a Spearman rank correlation value of 0.54 (P V 0.0002)
was obtained between p27 and Smad2P immunoreactivity (the
latter values were obtained from the same patients in a previous
study; ref. 4), providing a statistically significant correlation between
loss of TGF-h/Smad2 signaling and p27 expression in ECA.
ECA tissue lysates ubiquitylate and degrade exogenous
rp27. p27 levels are subject to regulation via the ubiquitinproteasome pathway (16). Exogenous rp27 was previously shown
to be ubiquitylated and degraded by malignant cell and tissue
lysates using specific assays (29, 30, 32). We used these assays to

Regulation of p27Kip1 by TGF-b, Estrogen, and Progesterone

determine whether the absence of p27 in the malignant glands
in vivo (Fig. 2) and in primary ECA cells in vitro (Fig. 1B) was associated with increased degradation of p27 through the ubiquitinproteasome pathway. Following incubation of rp27 with tissue
lysates from SE, 89% of the rp27 added remains after 20 h, whereas
58% and only 4% of rp27 remain in the ECA tissue lysates after
30 min and 3 h, respectively (Fig. 3A). A moderate decrease in
rp27 is obtained with tissue lysates from PE (data not shown). Of
note, the multiple upper bands above M r 27 kDa suggested that
ubiquitylated rp27 is being detected by anti-p27 and that rp27 is
most likely degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
Following depletion of the proteasome fraction, 72% of rp27
remains intact at 6 h compared with only 6% remaining after
3-h incubation with an ECA lysate (grade I/II) containing
proteasomes (Fig. 3B). Similarly, replacing ECA proteasomes with
those from SE slowed p27 degradation rates compared with that
of normal SE (data not shown). The bands above 27 kDa (ECA
proteasome depleted; Fig. 3B) most likely represent ubiquitylated
rp27 that is not degraded because the proteasomes have been
removed. This is further substantiated by the use of the proteasome inhibitor hemin, which partially blocked rp27 degradation
by the ECA lysates (grade I/II shown), such that 83% of rp27
is retained in the tumor cell lysate at 3 h compared with 37% in
the untreated sample (Fig. 3C). Although these experiments
were done in the presence of protease inhibitors, degradation of
rp27 is still evident in the hemin-treated sample. Thus, it seems
that other proteases also degraded rp27 in these tissue lysates.
The addition of MG132, another inhibitor of proteasomes, similarly
blocked degradation of rp27, albeit also not completely (data not
shown). rp27 remained intact in two normal SE and one slightly
degraded rp27. Moderate degradation of rp27 occurred in two of
two lysates from PE. These results may reflect patient variability or
rates of rp27 degradation by tissues derived from different days
within the phases of the menstrual cycle. In contrast, six of seven

ECA tissue lysates, representing all grades of ECA, were able to
degrade rp27. The tumor (grade III/III) that did not degrade rp27
concordantly showed moderate expression of p27 by immunohistochemistry (data not shown). Importantly, there was complete
correlation between the rate of degradation of rp27 and the levels
of p27 observed in the glands in vivo by immunohistochemistry in
all tissue samples of both normal and malignant tissue (n = 12). Our
data suggest that the loss of p27 in vivo and the degradation of
exogenously added rp27 are via ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
degradation. We interpret the differences in ubiquitylated rp27
(slower migrating protein bands detected by anti-p27) among the
ECA tissues used in Fig. 3A and B to reflect patient variability and
different rates of proteasome degradation of ubiquitylated rp27.
By using an assay/reaction mixture devised to preserve
ubiquitylated proteins, we show that p27 is indeed ubiquitylated
by endometrial tissue lysates shown to degrade p27 (29, 30). As
illustrated (Fig. 3D), tissue lysates from patients representing
different grades of ECA consistently ubiquitylate rp27 in vitro after
75-min incubation. In contrast, SE tissue lysates do not ubiquitylate rp27. As protease inhibitors were not included in this reaction mixture, it seems that certain proteases may have reduced
the quantity of intact protein after 75 min. Furthermore, in agreement with the lower mean expression level of p27 in vivo in PE
compared with SE (Fig. 2), PE lysates ubiquitylate rp27 (data
not shown).
Estrogen induces MAPK-dependent proteasomal degradation of p27Kip1 in primary cultures of normal EECs. Estrogens
have been shown to induce genes involved in cell growth through
activation of the MAPK pathway (33). As MAPK has been shown to
phosphorylate p27 at Thr187 (26, 34), we hypothesized that estrogen
might decrease p27 levels to enable proliferation of normal EECs by
activating MAPK to phosphorylate p27 for subsequent ubiquitinmediated degradation. As illustrated (Fig. 4A), addition of E2 to
EECs, which contain abundant levels of endogenous p27, reduces

Figure 3. Effect of endometrial tissue extracts on the degradation and ubiquitylation of exogenously added rp27. Tissue lysates of normal and malignant endometrium
were incubated with purified histidine-tagged rp27, using a previously described assay designed to detect the capacity for degradation of p27 by cancer tissues (32).
Briefly, clarified cell lysates were prepared as described in Materials and Methods and equal amounts of protein (75–100 Ag) were incubated with 1 Amol/L
histidine–tagged rp27 in 30 AL degradation buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, 2 mmol/L ATP] containing a cocktail of protease
inhibitors (Sigma), as described by Pagano (30, 32). The reaction was terminated by removing 5.0 AL (12–16 Ag) aliquots into sample buffer at the times indicated
and the samples were either flash-frozen in liquid N2 or subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer onto Hybond PVDF membranes for 1 h. The membranes
were stained with Ponceau S and then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS overnight at 4jC, followed by incubation with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to human
p27 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer for 2 h and then with HRP-conjugated donkey antirabbit secondary antibody (1:2,000) in PBS containing
0.1% Tween 20. The graphs (right ) derived from densitometry of the blots represent percent of rp27 remaining based on relative intensity (Y axis ) of each band
over time compared with the sample relative intensity at 1 min following addition of recombinant rp27. A, tissue lysates from ECA degrade rp27 at a more rapid rate
than normal endometrial tissue. The rate of rp27 degradation in a tissue lysate from ECA (right ) is compared with that in a tissue lysate from SE (left). The patient
samples used were as follows: SE (n = 3), PE (n = 2), and ECA (n = 7). The bands migrating slower than p27 are presumably p27 ligated with different numbers
of ubiquitin molecules; this varied among the patient tissue samples. B, removal of the proteasome fraction from ECA lysates increased the amount of exogenous
rp27 that remained intact. The proteasome fraction was removed from ECA samples by ultracentrifugation at 100,000  g for 6 h in the presence of 5 mmol/L MgCl2,
before adding rp27 to the reaction mixtures. The patient samples used were as follows: ECA grade I/II (shown) and ECA grade II/II (n = 2). C, hemin partially
blocks the ability of ECA lysates to reduce the levels of exogenously added rp27. Hemin (100 Amol/L), a physical blocker of entry of protein into the proteasome
for subsequent degradation, was added to the tissue lysates before adding rp27 and the levels of rp27 remaining were analyzed by densitometry of the blots. An
ECA grade I/II tissue lysate is shown. Tissue lysates from different ECA grades were used (n = 5). As a control, an equal amount of rp27 was added to the reaction
mixtures at the onset of the experiments (B and C, right lane ). D, tissue lysates from different grades of ECA ubiquitylate exogenous rp27 whereas lysates from
SE lack this ability. The in vitro ubiquitylation assay using tissue lysates was previously described (29, 32). Normal and ECA tissue lysates (40 Ag) in a final volume
of 10 AL were incubated at 30jC in a reaction mixture containing the following reagents: 1 Amol/L rp27, 40 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT,
0.5 mmol/L ATP, 10 mmol/L creatinine phosphate, 0.1 Ag/mL creatinine kinase, 1 Amol/L ubiquitin aldehyde (inhibits isopeptidase activity), 1.0 mg/mL methyl ubiquitin
(terminates ubiquitin chains for distinct band visualization), 1 Amol/L lactacystin (proteasome blocker; used to block the degradation of ubiquitylated p27), 1 Amol/L
okadaic acid (to maintain phosphorylated p27 for ubiquitylation), 10% glycerol, and 5 Amol/L biotinylated ubiquitin, prepared using EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce;
to provide an excess of ubiquitin). Aliquots were removed at time 0 and 75 min to an equal volume of 2 sample buffer and the ubiquitylated rp27 was analyzed
by immunoblotting, as described in (A). The protein constituents that enable the ubiquitylation of p27 are provided by the tissue lysates used in the in vitro ubiquitylation
assay (29) and the reagents of the reaction mixture stabilize the intermediate ubiquitylated molecules to enable observation of p27 by immunoblotting, which are
shown as a ladder of protein bands that migrate slower than native rp27 protein. HeLa cell lysate (20 Ag), previously shown to ubiquitylate p27 (29), was used
as a positive control. The different grades of ECA lysates (left) are shown above the blot. ECA tissue lysates of various grades yielded similar results (n = 12). From
the molecular mass increase of one band of slower mobility than M r 27 kDa, it seems that only one ubiquitin molecule (M r f9 kDa) was conjugated to rp27
(upper arrow ) in the reaction mixture. Similarly, lysates from normal PE ubiquitylated rp27 (data not shown; n = 3). In contrast, lysates from normal SE (right )
fail to ubiquitylate rp27, as shown by the blot of the two SE tissue lysates (n = 3). As shown here, other proteases degraded rp27 at 75 min in these two SE tissue lysates
as protease inhibitors were not included in this assay.

endogenous p27 levels by 2.4-fold in normal tissue #1 and by
1.4-fold in normal tissue #2, which are restored and enhanced by
1.5- and 1.2-fold, respectively, over the untreated control, in the
presence of the MAPK inhibitor PD98059. In addition, as shown
in the blot of normal tissue #2, intracellular levels of p27 were
restored to untreated control levels by the estrogen receptor
antagonist ICI 182,780. In contrast, cultures of ECA cells with
negligible levels of p27 were unaffected by E2; blocking the estrogen
receptor increased p27 levels by 2.4-fold (Fig. 4B) in this sample.
Furthermore, intracellular p27 is preserved by increasing doses of
lactacystin in the presence of E2 (100 nmol/L), suggesting that
levels of p27 are attenuated by E2 via proteasomal degradation
(Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained with MG132 (data not
shown).
Progesterone increases p27Kip1 levels in primary cultures of
both EECs and ECA cells. Because progesterone inhibits the growth
of endometrial glandular cells, we reasoned that this hormone may
have an opposite effect than E2 on p27 and thus increase p27 levels.
As estrogen levels increase with temporal progression of the
proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, progesterone receptors
are progressively up-regulated (35) to enhance the progesterone
effect. Therefore, E2 and progesterone were added to the primary
EECs simultaneously to obtain a more robust progesterone-induced
response, as previously described (36). Whereas progesterone alone
increases endogenous p27 levels, E2 plus progesterone markedly
increases p27 by 6.7-fold, as shown in normal tissue #1, and by 2-fold
in normal tissue #2 (Fig. 5A). Blocking the progesterone receptor
with the antagonist mifepristone (RU-486) restored p27 to above the
untreated control level. Interestingly, E2 plus progesterone consistently induced an increase in p27 in ECA cell cultures, as shown in
Fig. 5B, by 1.8-fold in a grade ECA III/III that was blocked by RU-486.
In fact, blocking the progesterone receptor seemed to reduce p27

levels below untreated control. Therefore, progesterone treatment of
both normal and malignant endometrial cells effectively increases
intracellular levels of p27.

Discussion
The putative relationship between TGF-h–mediated growth
inhibition and p27 has been considered to be via the direct effect
of TGF-h on both p15 gene transcription and protein stability
leading to increased binding of p15 to cyclin D/cdk4 and cdk6 (and
inhibition of kinase activity; ref. 14, 37). This causes p27 to become
displaced from cyclin D/cdk4,6 and subsequently accumulate on
cyclin E/cdk2 complexes for the inhibition of cdk2 activity, thus
blocking S-phase progression. However, cells containing nonfunctional p15 are able to accumulate p27 and inhibit cyclin E/cdk2 in
response to TGF-h and, similarly, p15 null cells can still undergo
TGF-h–mediated growth inhibition (38, 39), suggesting that
compensatory or alternative mechanisms exist. As we have
previously shown that disrupted TGF-h signaling is an early event
in the development of ECA concomitant with loss of growth
inhibition (4), the present study was undertaken to elucidate
growth regulatory mechanisms potentially inactivated by disrupted
TGF-h signaling. Therefore, we determined whether TGF-h could
directly influence the levels of p27 as an effector of TGF-h–
mediated growth regulation in normal primary cultures of EECs.
Our studies herein show that whereas TGF-h dose-dependently
increases the intracellular levels of p27 protein in cultures of EECs,
ECA cells do not respond (Fig. 1B ). Following subcellular
fractionation of EECs, the increase in p27 was observed in both
the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. However, there was a 2-fold
greater increase in the nucleus (Fig. 1C). In untreated EECs, >78%
of the p27 was in the nuclear fraction. In addition, the negligible

Figure 4. Analysis of intracellular p27 protein levels following treatment of primary normal EECs and ECA cells with E2. EECs, isolated from normal endometrium
containing abundant p27 in vitro and in vivo , as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively, were incubated with E2 (100 nmol/L) or E2 plus the MEK inhibitor PD98059
(20 Amol/L; all reagents were added every other day) and the experiments terminated with RIPA buffer. The cell lysates (30–40 Ag) were immunoblotted to determine
endogenous levels of p27, as described in Fig. 1B. The blots were subjected to densitometry to quantitate the amount of p27 in the treated sample versus the
untreated control and the fold change was determined following normalization of the sample load to h-actin. A, estrogen decreases the level of endogenous p27 in EECs
from SE (Normal #1) and PE (Normal #2), shown above. Both the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 completely block the
E2-induced decrease in p27. B , conversely, one primary culture of ECA (grade III/III) did not contain basal levels of p27 and was unaffected by E2 treatment. The
graphs (right ) derived from densitometry of the blots represent the fold change of p27 levels compared with the untreated controls. Similar results were obtained
with additional primary cell cultures isolated from separate normal endometrial tissue samples: PE (n = 3), SE (n = 6). C, estrogen decreases endogenous p27 in
primary normal EECs by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. To determine whether the decrease in p27 in E2-treated EECs is due to degradation of p27 via the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, the cultures were incubated with E2 (100 nmol/L), and 2.5 h before harvesting the cells, the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin
(1 and 10 Amol/L) was added to the cells. Lactacystin (1.0 Amol/L)–treated primary EEC cultures had similar levels of endogenous p27 as the untreated controls
(data not shown). The following patient samples were used in these experiments: SE (n = 4), PE (n = 1).

Regulation of p27Kip1 by TGF-b, Estrogen, and Progesterone

Figure 5. Analysis of p27 levels following treatment of primary cultures of normal EECs and ECA cells with medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate (Pg). Primary cultures
of normal EECs and ECA cells were separately treated with 100 nmol/L E2, 100 nmol/L progesterone (Pg ), and E2 plus progesterone every other day and the
experiments terminated at 4 d with RIPA buffer. The levels of endogenous p27 in the cell lysates (30 Ag) were determined by immunoblotting as described in
Fig. 1B. Fold induction of p27 is illustrated in the graphs (right). E2 was added together with progesterone to increase the level of progesterone receptors for a
more robust response (35). A, estrogen plus progesterone increases the levels of endogenous p27 in primary cultures of normal EECs. The primary cultures of two
normal tissues, Normal #1 (SE) and Normal #2 (PE), show the patient variability of basal levels of p27 with different levels of induction of p27 by progesterone.
The addition of 10 Amol/L mifepristone (RU-486) to the E2- and progesterone-treated cell cultures, shown in the cells of Normal #2, blocked the p27 increase induced by
E2 plus progesterone. The patient samples used are as follows: PE (n = 3), SE (n = 4). B, estrogen plus progesterone increases the levels of endogenous p27 in
primary cultures of ECA cells. The ECA cell cultures were treated as described in (A ). E2 and progesterone increased the levels of p27 compared with untreated controls
and RU-486 inhibited the response (a representative sample, ECA grade III/III, is shown; n = 6).

amounts of p27 shown in ECA cells were confined to the cytoplasm
(three of seven ECA primary cultures). This is of interest because,
more recently, cytoplasmic p27 has been associated with cell
motility and metastasis (40). Notably, the dose of TGF-h required to
induce maximal levels of p27 (100 pmol/L) parallels those
previously obtained for TGF-h–mediated growth inhibition of
EECs (4). However, a direct effect of TGF-h on increasing nuclear
levels of p27 for the putative inhibition of G1 cyclin/cdks has not
been previously shown in epithelial cells.
Considering the integral role for p27 in blocking cell cycle
progression, decreased levels of p27 have been shown in human
cancers (16, 23, 24), which often correlate with poor survival
(23, 41). Our studies show that, irrespective of grade, ECA had
a statistically significant decrease in the levels of p27 compared
with normal endometrial glands of SE, containing abundant p27 in
the nucleus [Fig. 2A, d compared with b (arrows)]. The negligible
levels of p27 in the PE glands (Fig. 2A-a) and nuclear abundance of
p27 in SE glands are expected and consistent with the status of
growth and differentiation of glands of PE and SE, respectively.
Similarly, other studies have shown decreased expression of p27 in
ECA compared with normal endometrium, which did not vary with
grade or stage (24, 42). In addition, we show that the disruption of
TGF-h signaling in ECA has a statistically significant correlation
with low to absent levels of p27 in the same patients, including
grade I carcinomas (4). Therefore, we propose that loss of TGF-h
signaling, which otherwise would increase intracellular levels of
p27, may be an early event that contributes to the pathogenesis of
ECA. Interestingly, because p27 is localized in the cytoplasm in
hyperplastic glands (Fig. 2A-c), we further hypothesize that ECA
may commence with p27 being driven from the nucleus, where it is
essential for inhibition of cdk2, into the cytoplasm, as an initial

www.aacrjournals.org

event marking neoplastic development of the endometrium and,
subsequently, loss of this protein in carcinoma. Therefore, the
absence or mislocalization of p27 may be a signal for the onset
of ECA.
A plethora of studies show that the fate of p27 and resulting
functional consequences are tightly regulated by cell cycle–
dependent phosphorylation of the molecule by different kinases
at specific sites that dictate both its degradation and nuclear
retention (15, 16, 19, 20, 43–45). The most prominent means for
posttranslational regulation of nuclear levels of p27, particularly
in cancer, is through ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p27 by
the 26S proteasome, which is signaled by phosphorylation of p27
on Thr187 by cyclin E/cdk2 and other kinases during S-G2 phase
of the cell cycle (16, 19, 46). In addition, phosphorylation of p27
on Ser10, Thr157, and Thr198 by certain kinases, including Akt,
causes cytoplasmic mislocalization of p27 and subsequent
ubiquitin-mediated degradation in G0-G1 (20, 26, 43–45, 47). In
all cases, lower levels of nuclear p27 ostensibly foster high
nuclear activity of cdk2 for cell cycle progression. Consistent
with the lack of p27 in the glands of ECA tissue in vivo (Fig. 2),
we show that lysates from all grades of ECA tissue ubiquitylate
and rapidly degrade exogenously added rp27 compared with
normal SE lysates (Fig. 3A and D). Inhibition of p27 degradation
by removal of proteasomes and separately by proteasome
inhibitors in these in vitro assays indicates that the degradation
of p27 is largely ubiquitin-proteasome mediated (Fig. 3B and C).
In addition, it was evident that other proteolytic systems
degraded p27 in the presence of protease inhibitors. Studies
using a similar assay showed that lysates from colon carcinoma
tissues with low or absent levels of p27 displayed proteasomedependent degradation of p27 (32). We did not determine the

extent of nuclear or cytoplasmic degradation of p27. Furthermore, the kinase(s) involved in the phosphorylation of p27 to
trigger ubiquitylation present in the ECA tissue lysates is not
known. However, MAPK, constitutively active in many human
cancers, has been shown to phosphorylate p27 at Thr187 in breast
tumor cells (16, 46). Moreover, blocking MAPK decreased
epidermal growth factor receptor kinase activity, stabilizing p27
and delaying tumor formation in a mouse mammary model of
tumorigenesis (34). With the use of specific kinase inhibitors and
deletion mutants of p27, we should be able to determine both
the kinases and the phosphorylation sites involved in p27
degradation in ECA. Similar to the ECA tissue lysates, PE lysates
lacked p27 expression in vivo and ubiquitylated and degraded
p27. As TGF-h signaling is intact in these cells, p27 can
ostensibly be induced for growth inhibition in the secretory
phase of the menstrual cycle when TGF-h levels are higher and
signaling is most active (4, 48). Importantly, patients’ tissue
lysates showed 100% correlation between the ability to degrade
p27 in vitro and complete absence of p27 from the malignant
glands in vivo. Therefore, we postulate that the absence of p27
from the malignant glands and those of PE in vivo might result
from a high rate of proteasomal degradation. In this light,

proteasome inhibitors have been shown to be a favorable
therapeutic route for certain human cancers, including multiple
myeloma (49). The importance of maintaining sufficient levels of
p27 for growth inhibition is underscored by studies showing
that overexpression of p27 in human breast epithelial and cancer
cell lines could lengthen G1 phase and suppress tumorigenicity
in vivo (50). Taken together, the data suggest that the pathogenesis of ECA may be related to a high rate of p27 degradation
and simultaneous lack of TGF-h signaling that would otherwise
enable TGF-h–mediated accumulation of this protein.
Our findings implicate a dynamic regulation of p27 levels in
both normal endometrial growth and pathogenesis of ECA. The
hormones, E2 and progesterone, have mitogenic and antimitogenic effects on endometrial growth, respectively. Whereas the
basal levels of p27 protein are variable in tissue culture as well
as the degree of response of specific patients, E2 treatment of
normal EECs derived from both PE and SE decreases the levels
of endogenous p27 (Fig. 4) and, conversely, progesterone
treatment of EECs from both PE and SE markedly increased
the levels of endogenous p27 levels (Fig. 5). Antagonists of
estrogen receptor (ICI 182,780) and the progesterone receptor
(RU-486) restored p27 to near basal levels in the normal EEC

Figure 6. TGF-h, E2, and medroxyprogesterone
17-acetate (Pg ) actions converge on the levels of p27 in
primary cultures of normal EECs and ECA cells. The data
indicate that p27 levels vary throughout the normal
menstrual cycle to control endometrial cell growth. E2
decreases p27 levels by ubiquitin-mediated degradation in
the 26S proteasomes in the proliferative phase (PE) of the
menstrual cycle. Conversely, progesterone causes an
accumulation of p27 levels in the secretory phase (SE) of
the menstrual cycle. In addition, normal TGF-h signaling
increases p27 levels in SE. As such, p27 levels are low to
absent in endometrial glands in PE and abundant in SE
in vivo , as shown (Fig. 2). p27 is absent in ECA due to a
high rate of ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation
and disrupted TGF-h receptor signaling, which renders the
carcinoma cells unable to be induced by TGF-h for p27
accumulation. Type I endometrioid ECA has been shown to
occur due to unopposed E2, as in anovulation, menopause,
and tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer (6, 7). We propose
that the high rate of p27 degradation coupled with lack of
progesterone and the inability of TGF-h to induce p27
accumulation (when TGF-h receptors are down-regulated
or signaling is disabled) lead to uncontrolled proliferation
of EECs thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of ECA.
However, ECA cells that possess progesterone receptors
can still accumulate p27 in response to progesterone
in vitro (large circle ). Because progesterone is therapeutic
for ECA (8), p27 may be a target for successful therapy by
progesterone for endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma
(in inhibition of endometrial cell growth). Double arrows,

cultures, indicating that p27 is specifically regulated by hormone
receptor–mediated responses.
We show that inhibitors of both MAPK/extracellular signal–
regulated kinase kinase (MEK) and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways
block the E2-dependent decrease in cellular levels of p27 in primary
cultures of normal EECs, suggesting that the observed E2-induced
proteasomal degradation may be MAPK driven. Thus, at least one
mechanism of E2-induced proliferation in the normal endometrium
and in estrogen-induced type I endometrioid ECA may be by
lowering p27 levels through this pathway to enable S-phase
progression. In breast cancer cells, E2 activates the MAPK pathway
downstream from Ras, initiating phosphorylation of p27 at Ser10,
which causes p27 to bind to the nucleopore protein, CRM1,
followed by export of p27 from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for
degradation (26). Therefore, it is possible that Ras may be involved
in E2-induced activation of MAPK in the endometrium. It has been
shown that both the pure estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780
and tamoxifen, successfully used to treat breast cancer, increase p27
and p21 intracellular levels and mediate their binding to cyclin E/cdk
complexes to block S-phase entry (25, 27). However, our studies
implicate the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in
E2-induced p27 degradation in the endometrium (Fig. 4C).
Progesterone has been shown to induce growth inhibition
concomitant with increased p27 levels in an ECA cell line and
primary normal EECs by promoting the binding of p27 to cdk2 and
decreasing the rate of p27 degradation (51). We are currently
investigating the mechanism involved in the progesterone-induced
increase in p27 observed herein including its effect on subcellular
distribution of p27, which presumably would be nuclear to inhibit
cdk2 activity, as described above. Importantly, we show that
progesterone increases p27 levels in both normal EECs and ECA
cells. Therefore, we raise the possibility that the therapeutic action
of progesterone on endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma may be
directly related to the increase of nuclear levels of p27 in these
cells. Moreover, the response to progesterone is not surprising as
75% of ECA patients, particularly well-differentiated cancers, retain
progesterone receptors (52).
In primary endometrial normal and malignant cells, we show
that the increase in p27 levels induced by TGF-h is not at the

transcriptional level but that novel protein synthesis is involved. In
further studies, we show that TGF-h may accumulate p27
intracellular levels by preventing its ubiquitin-mediated degradation by down-regulating Skp2 and Cks1 (53),1 the requisite and
rate-limiting proteins of the SCF complex that targets p27 to the
proteasome (16). This might occur by induction of a corepressor
acting on the Cks1 and/or Skp2 promoter. Interestingly, p27 levels
are elevated in both Skp2 and Cks1 null mice that have reduced
growth rates (54, 55). Further to these findings, Skp2 and Cks1 are
overexpressed in a number of human cancers (16), often with a
concomitant decrease in p27. Still, there may be complementary
means for TGF-h to increase intracellular levels of p27 for growth
inhibition of EECs to prevent its degradation and/or through
translational control. Our studies provide evidence that dysregulated TGF-h signaling results in lack of p27 accumulation in ECA.
We propose that lack of TGF-h– and/or progesterone-induced
accumulation of p27 and increased phosphorylation of
p27 by an E2-activated MAPK, causing heightened proteasome
degradation, lead to endometrial hyperplasia, the precursor to
estrogen-induced ECA. Importantly, the opposing effects of E2 and
progesterone on the regulation of p27 suggest that this cdk inhibitor
is a mediator of both induction of E2-induced hyperplasia and
ECA and progesterone-mediated amelioration of this disease. As
depicted (Fig. 6), our studies clearly show that TGF-h, E2, and
progesterone converge on the regulation of p27 levels, thus
providing a potential therapeutic target for restoration of normal
growth of the endometrium.
