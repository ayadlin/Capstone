Abstract
Overcoming the profound immunosuppression in patients
with solid cancers has impeded efficacious immunotherapy.
Signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3)
has recently emerged as a potential target for effective
immunotherapy, and in this study, we describe a novel small
molecule inhibitor of STAT3 that can penetrate the central
nervous system (CNS) in mice and in physiologically relevant
doses in vitro and reverse tolerance in immune cells isolated
from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. Specifically, it
induces the expression of costimulatory molecules on peripheral macrophages and tumor-infiltrating microglia, stimulates
the production of the immune-stimulatory cytokines interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-12, and IL-15, and induces proliferation
of effector T cells from GBM patients that are refractory to
CD3 stimulation. We show that the functional enhancement of
immune responses after STAT3 inhibition is accompanied by
up-regulation of several key intracellular signaling molecules
that critically regulate T-cell and monocyte activation.
Specifically, the phosphorylation of Syk (Tyr352) in monocytes
and ZAP-70 (Tyr319) in T cells are enhanced by the STAT-3
inhibitor in marked contrast to toll-like receptor and T-cell
receptor agonists, respectively. This novel small molecule
STAT3 inhibitor has tremendous potential for clinical applications with its penetration into the CNS, easy parental
administration, direct tumor cytotoxicity, and potent immune
adjuvant responses in immunosuppressed cancer patients.

Introduction
In patients with solid tumors, systemic immune responses are
unable to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (1). Patients with malignant gliomas are profoundly
immunosuppressed with impaired T-cell responses secondary to
impaired T-cell receptor signaling, immunosuppressive cytokines,
regulatory T cells, and dysfunctional antigen-presenting cells (APC;
ref. 2). We have found that CD11b/c+CD45+ glioma infiltrating

microglia/macrophages from postoperative tissue specimens of
glioma patients had surface MHC class II expression but lacked
expression of the costimulatory molecules CD86, CD80, and CD40
critical for T-cell activation and thus were unable to stimulate
naive T cells. Also, within malignant gliomas, there is a lack of
effector/activated CD8 T cells. To overcome these profound
immunologic impairments in responsiveness, compounds that
are capable of modulating the local immune responses may
provide synergistic effects.
Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), in
particular, STAT3, has recently emerged as a potential target for
effective immunotherapy (3). The role of STAT proteins in the
development of tumors is varied but STAT3 is constitutively
activated in many common tumors, including high-grade human
gliomas (4). Inhibition of STAT3 signaling leads to an inhibition
of cancer cell growth and to the induction of apoptosis. In
addition, STAT3 has been shown to be a potent regulator of
inflammatory responses. STAT3 suppresses macrophage activation in vitro (5–7) and limits the host’s inflammatory response
(8). When STAT3 has been blocked, either with a dominant
negative variant or an antisense oligonucleotide, macrophages
have been shown to increase the production of interleukin-12
(IL-12) and RANTES and reverse systemic tolerance (9). WP1066,
a novel small molecule STAT3 inhibitor, has proapoptotic and
antiproliferative activity in a variety of tumor cell types, including
human malignant glioma cell lines U87-MG and U373-MG,
indicating that WP1066 has potent intrinsic antiglioma activity
in vivo (10).
In this study, we show that STAT3 blockade by a novel small
molecule can reverse immune tolerance in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients. We determined that this STAT3 inhibitor
could act as a potent immune adjuvant by up-regulating
costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in not only peripheral
blood monocytes but also glioma-infiltrating microglia/macrophages and induce effector T cell–stimulating cytokines. Furthermore, this STAT3 inhibitor is able to activate and induce
proliferation of effector T cells from GBM patients that are
refractory to CD3 stimulation. In addition, it is speculated that
STAT3 signaling can regulate downstream activation of nuclear
factor-nB (3). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk initiates downstream signaling events during human monocyte activation,
whereas the phosphorylation of Tyr319 in Zap-70 plays a critical
role in mediating T-cell activation via signaling through the T-cell
receptor. We show augmentation of phosphorylation of key
intracellular signaling molecule Syk (Tyr352) in monocytes and
ZAP-70 (Tyr319) in T cells, thereby providing a critical mechanism
by which this molecule can act upon immune cells and overcome
immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment.

Novel Small Molecule for Malignant Glioma Patients

Materials and Methods
Human Subjects
Patients’ tumors (n = 11) were graded pathologically as GBM by a
neuropathologist according to the WHO classification. Peripheral blood was
drawn from the patients intraoperatively. This study was conducted under
protocol LAB03-0687, which was approved by the institutional review board
of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, and informed
consent was obtained. Peripheral blood from normal donors was obtained
from Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, (Houston, TX).
Antibodies and reagents. WP1066 was synthesized and supplied by
Dr. Priebe. The cell surface was stained with PE, FITC or allophycocyaninlabeled antibodies against the following proteins: CD11b, CD14, CD80, and
CD86 (PharMingen). For intracellular cytokine staining, PE-labeled or FITClabeled antibodies against IL-1h, IL-2, IL-4, IL-15, and IL-12 (R&D Systems)
were used. Intracellular STAT3 was assessed using phosphorylated Stat3
Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Cell Signaling Technology). Appropriate isotype
controls were used for each antibody. CFSE was from Invitrogen. Purified
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (Sigma-Aldrich
Corp.).
Animal experiments. WP1066 was injected i.p. at doses of 100 mg/kg
every other day for 2 weeks in nude mice. Plasma, central nervous system
(CNS) tissue, and U87-MG flank tumors were harvested and, after extraction,
were analyzed for WP1066 content using tandem liquid chromatography/
mass spectrometry.

Isolation of Microglia/Macrophages from Human Brain
Tumor Tissue
To purify microglia/macrophages from human brain tissue, we used a
modified Percoll gradient isolation technique as previously described (11).
This technique minimized artificial activation of the microglia/macrophages, and these cells were isolated within 3 h of surgical resection. Briefly,
after resection, freshly isolated tumor was mechanically dissociated and
layered onto successive density gradients. Microglia/macrophages were
collected from the interface between the 1.065 and 1.03 g/mL layers and
washed, and their viability determined by the trypan blue dye-exclusion
method.
Isolation of monocytes from human peripheral blood. Due to the
technical difficulties in obtaining large quantities of microglia/macrophages
from human glioma specimens, the precursors, monocytes (12), were used
in several experiments. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC; from
GBM patients or normal donors) were removed from the buffy coat layer
and washed. Untouched monocytes were isolated via negative selection
using a monocyte bead isolation kit and Midi-MACS magnetic separation
column (Miltenyi Biotec). The isolated monocytes were 97% positive for
CD11b+ cells.
Stimulation of microglia/peripheral blood monocytes with WP1066.
Cells (microglia or monocytes) were added to 96-well plates at 1  106 cells
per well. LPS (5 Ag/mL) or WP1066 (0.1, 1, or 10 Amol/L) was added to each
well at the indicated dose and incubated for various time points at 37jC, 5%
CO2 along with unstimulated controls. In addition to the stimulation,
monocytes were also incubated with supernatant from U-87 cell culture,
previously shown to contain immunosuppressive cytokines [IL-10 and
transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h); ref. 13]. Stimulated cells were then
washed in media and used either for direct fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis or in functional assays.

Surface Marker and Intracellular Cytokine Staining
Cells were blocked for nonspecific binding using purified anti-CD16
antibody (PharMingen) for 20 min, and after washing, the cells were
incubated with the fluorescence-labeled primary antibody or isotype control
for 30 min at 4jC. For the intracellular cytokine or STAT3 analysis,
microglia/macrophages or monocytes were fixed with Cytofix/Cytoperm
(BD Biosciences), washed in PermWash (BD Biosciences), and then stained
with fluorescence-labeled monoclonal antibodies or isotype controls for
30 min at 4jC. Cells were analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
using Cellquest software (BD Immunocytometry Systems).

T-cell proliferation assay. Stimulator cells (antigen-presenting cells)
were monocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of the respective glioma
patients or monocytes from normal donors. Monocytes were isolated and
purified as described above. To isolate autologous responder T cells, PBMCs
from the same monocyte source were labeled with CD8 microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotec) and passed through a magnetic separation column (LS
MACS Column, Miltenyi Biotec) placed in the magnetic field of a MACS
separator (Miltenyi Biotec). CD8+ cells were retained on the column,
whereas the unlabeled cell fraction ran through. The cells were washed and
determined to be 97% CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. Responder CD8+ T
cells were then labeled with CFSE (11), whereas the antigen-presenting
monocytes were prestimulated with either LPS or WP1066 as described
above. For the proliferation assay, in a 96-well plate, CFSE labeled responder
CD8+ T cells (0.75  105 cells per 50 AL per well) were added to the
autologous stimulator monocyte population at a range of 0.75 to 2.25  105
cells per 50 AL per well ( for final responder/stimulator ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and
1:3) and incubated for 4 days at 37jC, 5% CO2 with either purified. Controls
included T cells incubated in media alone, each stimulator in media alone,
and T cells stimulated with purified anti-CD3 antibody or anti-CD3 + antiC28 antibodies. After incubation, cells were labeled with anti-CD11b and
anti-CD8 antibodies to identify the CFSE stimulator cells and CFSE+
responder T cells, respectively, for analysis by FACS.
Western blot analysis of cell signaling molecules. Monocytes from
GBM patients were purified as described above. T cells from the same
patients were isolated with human CD3 microbeads and a magnetic
separation column (LS MACS column, Miltenyi Biotec) with the exception
of one patient who lacked sufficient PBMCs for both monocyte and T-cell
isolations. Monocytes or T cells were seeded at a density of 1  106 cells per
well in six-well culture plates and were incubated at 37jC, 5% CO2, with
either the medium or medium supplemented with 5 Amol/L WP1066.
After 2 h, monocytes and T cells were stimulated for 5 min with 2 Ag/mL
LPS and 5 Ag/mL anti-CD3 antibody, respectively, in the presence or
absence of WP1066. Subsequently, cells were lysed in buffer containing 1%
Triton-X and protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein aliquots (20 Ag)
from each monocyte and T-cell lysate were electrophoretically fractionated
in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Autoradiography of
the membranes was done using Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence
Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). After stripping the
membrane, it was reblotted with antibody to phosphorylated p72Syk (Tyr352;
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). With subsequent restripping, the membrane was reblotted with antibodies to Syk, phosphorylated Hck, Hck, and
Lyn (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). For the T-cell membranes, after
stripping, the membrane was reblotted with antibody to phosphorylated
ZAP-70 (Tyr319; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). With subsequent restripping, the membrane was reblotted with antibodies to ZAP-70, p56-Lck
(Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), and h-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively.
Semiquantification of protein on the Western blots was done using Scion
Image software (Scion Co.).
Statistics. Statistical analyses were done using the Student’s t test, and
all values with P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results and Discussion
Current immune stimulators/adjuvants are insufficient to overcome the immunosuppressive influences of the tumor microenvironment in patients with malignant human gliomas and solid cancer
(1). Therefore, we investigated whether a pharmacologic derivative
of the natural compound, caffeic acid (WP1066; Fig. 1A), a small
molecule inhibitor of STAT3 activity could overcome these immunosuppressive factors. In the murine model, WP1066 has a plasma halflife of >4 h, and studies in the animals bearing flank tumors showed
selective uptake of the compound by tumors, which showed a higher
drug content than any other tissue. WP1066 delivered i.p. at doses
of 100 mg/kg every other day for up to 2 weeks or i.v. at doses of only

penetration in vitro and in vivo.

WP1066 was injected i.p. at doses of

mice. Plasma, CNS tissue, and
U87-MG flank tumors were analyzed for
WP1066 content using tandem liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry.
C, untreated and WP1066-treated normal
donor PBMCs were assessed for
phosphorylated STAT3 activity (shaded

isotype controls (clear histogram ) by
intracellular staining with a phosphorylated

analysis by flow cytometry. D, 1  106
normal donor PBMCs incubated at 37jC,
5% CO2 with different doses of WP1066
(0.1–5 Amol/L) for 2 and 4 h. Cells were
stained with fluorescently labeled anti-CD3
and anti-CD11b antibodies and propidium
iodide (PI ) and analyzed by flow
cytometry. Macrophages and T cells were
gated on CD11b+ and CD3+ populations,
respectively, and cell death (%) was
quantified as CD11b+PI+ or CD3+PI+
populations in the respective plots.
Plots represent the 5 Amol/L maximum
dose (clear histogram ) compared with
control untreated cells (shaded histogram )
incubated under similar conditions.

10 mg/kg (data not shown) achieved plasma concentrations
in excess of 1 Amol/L, CNS concentrations in excess of 62 Ag/g
(0.1854 Amol/L) of tissue and in U87-MG malignant glioma-bearing
animals, and concentrations of 362 Ag/g (1.07 Amol/L) of tumor.
These data show that WP1066 can effectively cross the blood-brain
barrier and achieve CNS concentrations, a critical factor when
determining therapies for glioma patients (Fig. 1B).
STAT3 is constitutively activated in many tumors (4), and
WP1066 has been shown to inhibit STAT3 and have proapoptotic
activity in a variety of tumor cell types, including malignant gliomas
(10). The proapoptotic activity WP1066 possesses may contribute to
an induced neutropenia and lymphopenia, but at doses achievable
in vivo (1 nmol/L to 5 Amol/L) that inhibit STAT3 within immune
cells (Fig. 1C), cell viability is not compromised (Fig. 1D), suggesting
that WP1066 could be used as an immune adjuvant.
We recently reported that microglia/macrophages isolated from
human gliomas lacked expression of the costimulatory molecules
CD86 and CD80 and were unable to activate naive T cells (11). In

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

normal PBMCs, when STAT3 was blocked, macrophages increased
production of IL-12, induced Th1 responses, and reversed systemic
tolerance (9). WP1066 is capable of up-regulating CD80 and CD86 on
both normal donor PBMCs and also on tumor-infiltrating microglia/
macrophages freshly isolated from GBM patients (Fig. 2A). This
up-regulation of costimulation could even be achieved when human
monocytes were incubated with glioma supernatant known to
contain immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-h; Fig. 2B).
Furthermore, known immune activators, such as LPS, were
insufficient in up-regulating these costimulators on microglia
isolated directly from GBM patients (11), indicating that WP1066
is a potent agent for inducing costimulation.
Human glioma patients have also been shown to be deficient in
immunostimulatory cytokines (13). WP1066 can induce the crucial
cytokines that stimulate T-cell effector function, such as IL-2, IL-4,
IL-12, and IL-15 (Fig. 2C) from macrophages isolated from normal
donors and from GBM patients. IL-2 and IL-15 have been used
successfully in cancer immunotherapy to induce proliferation of

Figure 2. WP1066 is a powerful immune modulator in glioma patients. A, peripheral blood macrophages and glioma-infiltrating microglia/macrophages up-regulate
costimulatory molecules when incubated with STAT3 inhibitor WP1066. PBMCs from normal human donors (n = 5) and glioma-infiltrating microglia were purified
from freshly resected GBM patient tumor tissue (n = 3) and were incubated for 24 h at 37jC, 5% CO2, in either medium [RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)] or
medium supplemented with 1 Amol/L WP1066. Cells were then stained with fluorescent antibodies to CD11b+/CD45+ and either CD80 or CD86 and analyzed by
flow cytometry. Numbers in the top right quadrant of each graph denote the percentage of CD11b+-gated cells that express either CD80 or CD86. Despite the isolation of
purified microglia/macrophages, the size of these cells, dead cells, and other factors contribute to a significant double-positive, autofluorescent population upon
flow cytometry analysis. We have previously described our analysis strategy to exclude these cells (11). Briefly, the double-positive population within the isotype control
is gated, and the percentage of cells present in this autofluorescent population is determined (Supplementary Fig. S1). To exclude all autofluorescence, this number is
then subtracted from any double-positive subset analyzed within the same gate in the test samples. B, PBMCs from normal donors were incubated in either
control media (RPMI 1640 + 10% FBS) or U-87 glioma supernatant and stimulated with 1 Amol/L WP1066 as indicated. Cells were then stained with fluorescent
antibodies to CD11b+ and either CD80 or CD86 and analyzed by flow cytometry, as described in (A), to determine the percentage of CD11b+CD80+ and CD11b+CD86+
cells. C, PBMCs from normal human donors (n = 7) were incubated for 4 h at 37jC, 5% CO2, in either medium or medium supplemented with WP1066 (1 Amol/L) or
LPS (1 Ag/mL). Cells were then labeled with CD11b/CD14 macrophage markers, stained, and analyzed for intracellular cytokine production. Percentages of
macrophages that were CD11b+/CD14+ and also positive for the respective cytokine were calculated by flow cytometry analysis. A scatter plot representative of all
samples analyzed for macrophage intracellular cytokine production was determined with LPS-treated cells (circles ) and WP1066-treated cells (diamonds ). Black bars,
mean values of each subgroup. P values determining statistical significance between LPS-stimulated groups and WP1066-stimulated groups were determined
using Student’s t test. NS, not statistically significant.

tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (14, 15). IL-4 induces antitumor
factors (16) and can cause APC differentiation characterized by
efficient antigen uptake and processing (17). We also show lower
levels of IL-1h are induced by WP1066 when compared with LPS
stimulation. Recent data have shown that IL-1h is abundant at
tumor sites and play an important role in invasiveness and
metastasis of tumor cells (18, 19). Our data indicate that WP1066
can prime APCs for efficient antigen presentation and, in addition,
induces antitumor immunostimulatory cytokines.

T cells isolated from peripheral blood of GBM patients and
incubated with allo-CD11b+ macrophages are impaired in their
proliferative response to anti-CD3 stimulation. When additional
costimulation is provided with anti-CD28 antibody, T-cell proliferation is augmented in these patients (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, LPStreated macrophages induced only minimal T-cell proliferation
(20.3 F 5.9%) from newly diagnosed GBM patients (n = 3) compared
with unstimulated controls (17.0 F 3.6%; P = 0.15; Fig. 3B). In
contrast, physiologic doses of WP1066-treated macrophages

Figure 3. A, WP1066-treated APCs can stimulate strong proliferative responses in normally refractive T cells from the peripheral blood of GBM patients. CFSE-labeled
CD8+ T cells isolated from newly diagnosed GBM patients were incubated with untreated autologous APCs (CD11b+/CD14+) and anti-CD3 antibody, with anti-CD3
antibody + anti-CD28 antibody and with LPS-treated (5 Ag/mL) or WP1066-treated (1 Amol/L) autologous APCs. In all cases, cells were incubated for 4 d at
37jC, 5% CO2, followed by surface staining for T-cell markers (CD3, CD8) and analysis by flow cytometry. The number on each plot indicates the percentage of
CD8+-gated cells that have undergone cell division via CFSE dilution. These data are representative of three separate experiments. All APCs were treated with the
respective stimulants (control medium alone, LPS, or WP1066) for 24 h and then washed before incubation with T cells in the proliferation assay. B, proliferative
response of CD8+ T cells from GBM patients stimulated with LPS-treated or WP1066-treated APCs. The percentage of proliferating CD8+ T cells was calculated
based on the histogram in (A). LPS-treated macrophages induced only minimal T-cell proliferation from newly diagnosed GBM patients (n = 3) compared with
unstimulated controls (P = 0.15). In contrast, physiologic doses of WP1066-treated macrophages potently induced T-cell proliferation compared with unstimulated
macrophages (P = 0.01) and LPS-stimulated macrophages (P = 0.02). The P value was determined using Student’s t test.

Novel Small Molecule for Malignant Glioma Patients

Figure 4. WP1066 enhances phosphorylation of intracellular signaling molecules. Monocytes and T cells isolated from the PBMCs of GBM patients were incubated with
either the medium or medium supplemented with 5 Amol/L WP1066. After 2 h, monocytes and T cells were stimulated for 5 min with 2 Ag/mL LPS and
5 Ag/mL anti-CD3 antibody, respectively. Subsequently, cells were lysed, electrophoretically fractionated in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10. A, for monocyte membranes, subsequently the same membrane was
stripped and reblotted with antibodies to phosphorylated p72Syk (Tyr352), Syk, phosphorylated Hck, Hck, and Lyn. B, for the T-cell membranes, after stripping, the
membrane was reblotted with antibodies to phosphorylated ZAP-70 (Tyr319), ZAP-70, p56-Lck, and h-actin.

potently induced T-cell proliferation (30.7 F 7.4%; compared with
unstimulated macrophages, P = 0.01 and LPS-stimulated macrophages, P = 0.02; Fig. 3B) even without additional costimulation, as
shown in an example (Fig. 3A). Together with APCs, WP1066 could
stimulate T-cell proliferation that is profoundly impaired in GBM
patients compared with CD3-stimulated controls.
To determine how WP1066 induces these potent immune
responses, T cells and monocytes isolated from GBM patients were
treated with WP1066 and subsequently lysed and analyzed by
immunoblotting for critical signaling proteins. In contrast to LPS or
anti-CD3 antibody, WP1066 induced or enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation in both monocytes and T cells, producing the most
striking increase in levels of proteins of 70 to 75 kDa and 50 to 60 kDa
(Fig. 4A and B). Further analysis revealed that WP1066 markedly
induced phosphorylated p72Syk (Tyr352) by 184% and phosphorylated ZAP-70 (Tyr319) by 179% in monocytes and T cells, respectively,
compared with untreated cells. Less effect was observed on levels
of the Src family protein tyrosine kinase p57/p59-Hck in monocytes,
which was increased by 17%, and p56-Lck in T cells, which was
increased by 77% (Fig. 4). The tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk
initiates downstream signaling events during human monocyte
activation (20), whereas the phosphorylation of Tyr319 in Zap-70
plays a critical role in mediating T-cell activation via signaling
through the T-cell receptor (21). Both Syk and ZAP-70 can be
phosphorylated through autophosphorylation and transphoshor-

ylation. Although WP1066 did not affect the total protein level of
Syk (Fig. 4A), it markedly decreased the total protein level of ZAP-70
(Fig. 4B), suggesting that WP1066 may change localization and/or
stability of ZAP-70. The tyrosine phosphorylation of critical signaling
proteins induced/enhanced by WP1066 are likely pivotal to the
WP1066-induced restoration of immune function in GBM patients
and explains the mechanisms of potent immune activation.
Several immunotherapeutic clinical trials in glioma patients have
shown promise, but in patients with advanced cancers and grossly
evident disease, the objective response rates have remained low (1).
Potent immune activators are necessary to counteract the immunosuppressive factors that can overwhelm an induced immune
response. Small molecule inhibitors with well-characterized mechanisms of immune modulation, such as WP1066, can be effectively
and efficiently used in the setting of immunotherapy and/or vaccine
administration.
