Abstract
TP53 is the most frequently altered gene in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), with mutations occurring in
over two thirds of cases; however, the predictive response of these
mutations to cisplatin-based therapy remains elusive. In the
current study, we evaluate the ability of the Evolutionary Action
score of TP53-coding variants (EAp53) to predict the impact of
TP53 mutations on response to chemotherapy. The EAp53
approach clearly identiﬁes a subset of high-risk TP53 mutations

associated with decreased sensitivity to cisplatin both in vitro
and in vivo in preclinical models of HNSCC. Furthermore,
EAp53 can predict response to treatment and, more importantly, a survival beneﬁt for a subset of head and neck cancer
patients treated with platinum-based therapy. Prospective evaluation of this novel scoring system should enable more precise
treatment selection for patients with HNSCC. Cancer Res; 75(7);

Introduction

and over 500,000 worldwide with an associated disease-speciﬁc
mortality exceeding 50% (1). The treatment of locally advanced
head and neck cancer has evolved over the past three decades and
often requires complex, multimodality therapy, including surgical resection, and/or external beam radiation with or without
neoadjuvant, concurrent, or adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (2, 3). Currently, there are no molecular biomarkers to guide
selection among these various treatment options. TP53 is the most
frequently altered gene in human cancers and recent data from
whole-exome sequencing of HNSCC reveals that this gene is
mutated in 60%–80% of human papillomavirus negative (HPV)
cases (4, 5). The TP53 gene has been called the "cellular gatekeeper" due to its central role in response to cell stressors such as
DNA damage, hypoxia, and oncogenic stress. Cellular DNA
damage often leads to stabilization and accumulation of wtp53,
which in turn leads to enhanced transcription of p21 and subsequently cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. The increase
in p53 stability depends critically on the phosphorylation of
serine/threonine residues (6–9).
Although mutations in TP53 have been shown to have predictive signiﬁcance for response to platinum-based therapy in several
studies, it remains unclear how to stratify patients into response
categories based on TP53 status (10–14). Recently, we developed
an algorithm termed Evolutionary Action (EAp53) that accurately
stratiﬁes patients whose tumors have TP53 mutations associated
with especially poor outcomes (high risk), from other mutations
with outcomes similar to patients with wild-type TP53 (low risk)
and have validated EAp53 as a reliable prognostic marker (D.M.
Neskey and colleagues; submitted for publication). We hypothesize that high-risk p53 mutations identiﬁed by the EAp53 scoring
system are associated with an abnormal functional activity that

contributes to cisplatin resistance in head and neck cancer. Therefore, to determine whether EAp53 has utility as a predictive
biomarker of response to cisplatin in HNSCC, we used both
preclinical laboratory-based models and retrospective clinical
data to assess the response of tumors expressing no p53, wtp53,
or a series of low- and high-risk p53 mutations to cisplatin. The
ﬁrst aspect of our preclinical model found that in clonogenic
survival assays, cell lines expressing high-risk p53 mutations are
more resistant to cisplatin treatment than cell lines expressing
low-risk mutations or wild-type p53.
To further characterize the preclinical response of the TP53
mutations stratiﬁed by Evolutionary Action to cisplatin therapy, tumors harboring these mutations were created in an
orthotopic mouse model of tongue cancer. Concordant with
the differential effect of TP53 mutations on cisplatin response
observed in vitro, mice with tumors harboring wild-type p53 or
low-risk mutations showed a signiﬁcant response to cisplatin
therapy, whereas the tumors derived from cells either null for
p53 expression or with high-risk p53 mutations did not show
any growth inhibition with cisplatin therapy. In an effort to
correlate the clinical utility of the EAp53 to predict response to
cisplatin in patients with HNSCC, the TP53 mutational status
of a patient cohort of 68 patients treated for locally advanced
HNSCC of the oral cavity with cisplatin-based induction chemotherapy followed by surgical resection was determined.
Results from this analysis conﬁrmed our preclinical ﬁndings
wherein patients' tumors with high-risk mutations were significantly less responsive to cisplatin-based chemotherapy than
tumors with low-risk mutant or wild-type p53. These results
indicate that the TP53 mutational status may be a useful
biomarker for predicting response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in HNSCC patients.
In summary, our data clearly demonstrate that high-risk TP53
mutations are associated with decreased sensitivity to cisplatin
not only in preclinical studies but also in an analysis of a
neoadjuvant chemotherapy clinical trial. Prospective clinical
studies will be necessary to conﬁrm the utility of TP53 status
stratiﬁed by EA as a predictive biomarker of response to cisplatinbased therapy for HNSCC patients, which will potentially enable
the personalization of therapy for patients that will most likely
beneﬁt from this treatment strategy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Two HNSCC cell lines, UMSCC-1 and PCI-13, were selected
for their lack of p53 expression due to a splice-site in UMSCC1
(hg19:chr17:7578370C>T) and a deletion in PCI13 (hg19:
chr17:7579670_7579709del). UM-SCC-1 was provided by Dr.
Thomas Carey (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) in February 2010. PCI-13 was acquired from Dr. Jennifer Grandis
(University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) in August 2008. The
naturally occurring HNSCC cell lines, HN30 (wtp53) and HN31
(mutp53) were obtained in December 2008 from the laboratory
of Dr. John Ensley (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI). The cell
lines and their isogenic derivatives were tested and authenticated
against the parental cell lines by our group using short-tandem
repeat analysis (15) within 6 months of use for the current study.
Details regarding cell culture, reagents, and generation of stable
cell lines were previously described (D.M. Neskey and colleagues;
submitted for publication).

Classiﬁcation by evolutionary action scoring system
Missense TP53 mutations were divided into "high-risk" and
"low-risk" groups based on the model described previously (D.M.
Neskey and colleagues; submitted for publication).
Immunoblotting
Cells grown on 10-cm plates were treated with clinically relevant dose of cisplatin (1.5 mmol/L) for 24 hours and washed with
cold PBS. Western blotting was performed using standard techniques previously described (16) and primary antibodies to antip53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-126), anti-phospho-p53 serine 15 (Cell Signaling Technology, 9284), anti-p21 (Calbiochem,
OP64), and anti-b-actin (Sigma Aldrich, A1978) were used.
Transcriptional activity of TP53
Transcription of p21, a canonical p53 target, was measured via
luciferase reporter activity using a vector containing the 2.4 kb p21
promoter and ﬁreﬂy luciferase (pWWP-LUC; Addgene). UMSCC 1
and PCI-13 cells expressing various TP53 constructs, HN30, and
HN31 were cotransfected with pWWP-LUC and a constitutively
active Renilla luciferase construct using Lipofectamine 2000. After
48 hours, cells were treated with 1.5 mmol/L cisplatin and incubated for 24 hours before collection. Luciferase reporter activity
was measured as previously described (17). The results for the p21
reporter assay are relative to the cisplatin-treated wild-type (WT),
which was standardized to 100 relative light units.
Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analyses
The effect of TP53 mutants on transcription of three downstream target genes (p21, MDM2, and NOXA) were determined by
qRT-PCR. HNSCC (UMSCC1, PCI-13) cells stably expressing the
TP53-mutant constructs were treated with cisplatin (1.5 mmol/L)
for 24 hours before isolation of total RNA using RNeasy Mini
Kit (QIAGEN). Reverse transcription was performed using the
high capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol and a detailed
description is included in the Supplementary Materials and
Methods. The GAPDH gene was used as an internal control.
Triplicate samples were examined. The expression of each target
gene was normalized against GAPDH, which was calculated by
the DCt method [DDCt ¼ DCt of target gene  DCt of internal
control gene (GAPDH)], and results were presented as fold change
of expression.
mRNA expression arrays
Total RNA was isolated from cell lines by using TRI reagent and
hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0ST Arrays
(Affymetrix) according to manufacturer's instructions and a
detailed description is included in the Supplementary Materials
and Methods. The expression of TP53 target genes in pBabe and
each of other groups was calculated and heatmaps were generated
depicting the expression patterns of these genes.
Clonogenic survival assay
HNSCC cells stably expressing the TP53 constructs were
seeded in 6-well plates at various densities, which allowed for
approximately equal number of colonies in the control wells
for each construct. The next day, cells were treated with increasing doses of cisplatin (0.01–2 mmol/L) dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) for 24 hours and cultured for 10 to 14 days

EAp53 Predicts Response to Cisplatin in Head and Neck Cancer

to allow for colony formation of at least 50 cells. The cells were
stained with crystal violet and analyzed as previously described
(17). Each experiment was repeated more than three times and
treatments were performed in triplicates. An IC50 for each TP53
construct was calculated as the mean IC50 from each clonogenic
assay.
Orthotopic nude mouse model of oral cavity cancer
All animal experimentation was approved by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of the University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center. Our orthotopic nude mouse model of oral cavity
cancer has been previously validated and described in the literature (18). UMSCC1, PCI 13, and cells expressing either, a highrisk, low-risk TP53 mutation, a null pBabe TP53 vector or wildtype TP53 along with HN30 and HN31 cells were used in the study
and a detailed description of the technique is included in the
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Patient cohort and TP53 sequencing
A cohort of 68 patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with platinum-based induction chemotherapy followed by surgery was collected from two clinical trials to
investigate the predictive value of EAp53. Patient demographic,
clinical data, and cisplatin-based treatment regimens were previously published (12, 19). Patient data, specimens, and TP53
sequences were collected under Institutional Review Board–
approved protocols. DNA was extracted from tissue of patients
enrolled in the trials and different techniques were used to
determine TP53 sequence (20, 21). Detailed description of DNA
isolation and TP53 sequencing is included in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods. Patients with either TP53 wild-type or
missense mutations were then scored by the EAp53 system into
low- or high-risk categories as previously described (D.M. Neskey
and colleagues; submitted for publication). The Evolutionary
Action classiﬁcation score was then correlated with clinicopathologic factors and patient outcome to determine associations with
treatment response and survival.
Statistical analysis
ANOVA analysis with Student t tests were carried out to analyze
in vitro data. For mouse studies, the two-tailed t test was used to
compare tumor volumes between control and treatment groups.
Survival was determined using the Kaplan–Meier method and
compared using log-rank tests. Fisher exact test or c2 test were used
to calculate the ORs between treatment and clinical response. P
values <0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
DNA damage-induced functional activity of p53 in response to
cisplatin treatment is impaired in HNSCC cells expressing lowand high-risk TP53 mutations
To examine in preclinical models whether the response to
cisplatin therapy correlates with TP53 mutational status stratiﬁed by the Evolutionary Action method, the p53 function of
cell lines that either exogenously express various p53 constructs
including wild-type, low-, or high-risk mutant isoforms or
endogenously express wild-type p53 (HN30) or a high-risk
mutation (HN31) was assessed in these cells following treatment with cisplatin and analyzed by Western blot analysis. As
expected, low basal expression levels of p53 and p21 were

www.aacrjournals.org

increased after cisplatin treatment in cells expressing wild-type
TP53 (Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary Fig. S1A). In addition
to the p53 and p21 induction after cisplatin treatment in the
cell lines stably expressing wtp53, there was a similar level of
p53 phosphorylation observed in the cells compared with the
HN30 cell line, which endogenously expressed wtp53, indicating that the stably expressed wild-type TP53 was functionally active. In contrast, cells expressing mutant TP53 endogenously or exogenously, had higher basal levels of p53 with
minimal induction of p53 or p21 after cisplatin treatment,
indicating a lack of functional p53 (Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Regardless of mutational status, phosphorylation of p53 following cisplatin was a ubiquitous ﬁnding, but p21 induction was most evident in cells expressing
wtp53 and low-risk mutant p53. The data suggest that while
p53 phosphorylation occurs in response to DNA damage,
many of the high-risk mutations are not functional with respect
to p21 induction, and that low risk mutations may retain
partial wtp53 function.
Mutations in TP53 alter the DNA binding domain conformation and disrupt the ability of p53 to bind to target gene
promoters and consequently to transactivate downstream genes
(22) Thus, the ability of TP53 mutants to modulate the expression of classical wtp53 responsive target genes such as p21,
MDM2, and Noxa was examined by both p21 promoter luciferase assay and qRT-PCR. After cisplatin treatment, cells with
wtp53 have an increase in promoter activity while the low-risk
mutations have a stable level of activity and high risk p53 have
suppressed levels of p21 promoter activity relative to their basal
levels and to the basal levels of the empty vector control (Fig.
1C and Supplementary Fig. S1B). The mRNA levels of the target
genes, p21, MDM2, and Noxa were signiﬁcantly elevated in
response to cisplatin treatment in HNSCC cells harboring either
an exogenously expressed or endogenous wild-type p53. Cells
with low-risk mutations in the PCI13 cell line showed a trend
toward increased target gene expression following cisplatin
treatment relative to cells lacking p53, speciﬁcally the p21 level
in A161S, or MDM2 and Noxa levels in Y236C (Fig. 1D). This is
in contrast to cells harboring high-risk mutations where the
mRNA levels after cisplatin treatment were similar to cells
lacking p53 (Fig. 1D). Similar observations were seen in the
low-risk UMSCC1 cell lines, speciﬁcally MDM2 level in A161S
or MDM2 in Y236C. UMSCC1 cells harboring high-risk mutations were more variable in the target gene expression after
cisplatin treatment, which may represent unique properties of
these constructs or the cell background (Supplementary Fig.
S1C). The difference between p21 mRNA and protein levels
observed in PCI13 and UMSCC1 cells expressing the high-risk
mutant (R175H) is possibly due to posttranslational modiﬁcation event that resulted from less degradation of the mutant
protein and therefore enhanced its stability upon cisplatin
treatment. It could also be related to p63 and p73 isoforms
being differentially expressed in these cells upon cisplatin
addition. The p63 and p73 are well known p53-related proteins
that act as transcriptional activators of p21 and apoptotioc
inducers upon DNA damage in tumor cells (23). Taken together, these results reveal that cells with a mutated p53 have
increased basal levels of protein but following cytotoxic stress,
there is decreased promoter activity of the canonical target, p21,
and low mRNA levels of downstream target genes compared
with cells expressing wild-type p53.

HNSCC cells bearing high-risk TP53 mutations are highly
resistant to cisplatin treatment in vitro
To determine whether EAp53 has utility as a marker that can
predict HNSCC response to cisplatin therapy, we assessed the
response of HNSCC cells expressing no p53 (pBabe empty vector), wtp53, or a series of low- and high-risk p53 mutations to
cisplatin in clonogenic survival assays. Figure 2A is representative
images of clonogenic survival assay in HNSCC cell lines. As shown
in Fig. 2B and C, in both genetic backgrounds, the high-risk
mutant p53 clones were highly resistant to cisplatin, with 4 of
5 clones having an average IC50 of 0.95 mmol/L > 0.8 mmol/L,
when exposed to cisplatin for a 24-hour period. We have determined this in vitro exposure of 0.8 mmol/L to be equivalent to the
high dose of cisplatin (i.e., 100 mg/square meter) given to patients
based upon pharmacokinetic area under the curves (AUC) studies
in humans. Low-risk mutant p53 clones were less resistant to
cisplatin with an average IC50 of 0.72 mmol/L that is statistically
signiﬁcant when compared with the high-risk mutant p53 clones
(Fig. 2B and C). In addition, the clones expressing wild-type p53
had lower IC50 values (0.15 mmol/L) compared with clones with
null pBabe empty vector (0.44 mmol/L) in both PCI-13 (P <
0.001) and UMSCC1 (P < 0.003). These data suggest that introduction of low- and high-risk TP53 mutations into HNSCC cell
lines resulted in a gain-of-function (GOF) phenotype for resistance to cisplatin therapy. Furthermore, our laboratory has shown
that the endogenous mutp53 of HN31 also confers a relative
cisplatin resistance with an IC50 of 0.60 mmol/L compared with its
isogenic wtp53 counterpart, HN30, which has an IC50 of 0.14
mmol/L (24). To further address loss-of-function (LOF) versus
GOF, TP53 was knocked down in the isogenic pair of cell lines
HN30 (wtp53) and HN31 (HRmutp53) and cells were then
examined for cisplatin sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. S2A and
S2B). The shRNAp53 HN30 cells become more resistant to
cisplatin (IC50: 0.32 mmol/L), arguing that loss of wtp53 function
can make tumors less sensitive to cisplatin. Interestingly, knock-

down of mutant HR p53 in HN31 made cells more sensitive to
cisplatin with an IC50 value very close to the HN30 p53 knockdown (IC50 of 0.30 mmol/L vs. 0.32 mmol/L), indicating a GOF
associated with the HR mutation. Collectively, the data argue that
in vitro both loss of wtp53 and a HR-associated GOF contribute to
increased cisplatin resistance.
Expression proﬁle of high-risk TP53 mutations shows a lack of
p53 transcriptional activity while low-risk mutations retain
some residual function
Given the apparent GOF phenotype seen in our in vitro studies
of the p53 mutants, we performed mRNA expression proﬁling in
an effort to identify genes and pathways speciﬁc to the high-risk
mutp53 that could explain their relative resistance to cisplatin.
The principal component analysis of the gene expression proﬁles
for cisplatin-treated UMSCC1 cell lines, wtp53, pBabe, low-risk
mutation (A161S), or high-risk mutation (C238F), revealed that
the high-risk mutation expression proﬁles were more similar to
the pBabe cell line, which lacks p53 expression. This is apparent
from component 1 (x-axis), which accounted for 40% of variance
in expression. Furthermore, the low-risk mutation proﬁle
had smaller variances (20%) in expression from the pBabe and
high-risk mutations as seen by the large component 2 (y-axis)
contribution. In contrast, the wtp53 had the largest variances from
the high-risk mutation and pBabe and was also distinct from
the low-risk mutation proﬁles (Fig. 3A and B).
Ordinal logistic regression models were performed to identify
genes that contribute to either a GOF or LOF phenotype where the
magnitude of expression from highest to lowest is either high-risk,
low-risk, wtp53, and pBabe or wtp53, low-risk, high-risk, and
pBabe respectively. Surprisingly, based on our in vitro data, the
number of signiﬁcant genes with the false discovery rate set at
<10%, that contribute to a LOF phenotype was dramatically
higher than the number of genes associated with a GOF phenotype, 1190 and 0, respectively (Fig. 3B and C). Furthermore, the

the curves studies in humans. C, the average dose–response curve of cisplatin for low- and high-risk mutations and wild-type TP53. P < 0.001, low- and
high-risk mutation versus wild-type TP53.

beta-uniform mixture plot analyses for the two potential phenotypes reveal an enrichment of genes, with low P values leading
to nonuniform distribution of genes in LOF analysis compared
with the more uniform distribution in the GOF analysis (Fig. 3D
and E). These results validate the higher P value cutoff used in
the ordinal logistic regression analyses for LOF compared with
GOF (Fig. 3B and C). As expected, the primary pathways that
were driving these expression patterns were regulated by p53.
Overall, the results from the mRNA expression proﬁle reveal that
the introduction of a high-risk p53 mutation leads to a reduction
in the wild-type p53 function to levels similar to pBabe cells
that lack p53 expression. In addition, introduction of a lowrisk mutation results in an expression pattern suggestive of
residual wild-type p53 function as seen by the intermediate
level of expression of TP53 target genes (Fig. 3F and Supplementary Table S4).

these mutations were created in an orthotopic nude mouse model
of tongue cancer. Animals underwent a 4-week course of cisplatin
therapy, during which the tumor volumes and overall survival
were monitored. Consistent with the differential effect of TP53
status on cisplatin response observed in vitro, tumors in mice
injected with tumor cells expressing wild-type p53 showed a
signiﬁcant response to cisplatin therapy, while the tumors derived
from cells null for p53 expression harboring the pBabe vector
control or high-risk p53 mutations did not show any growth
inhibition with cisplatin therapy (Fig. 4A–C). Interestingly, the
response of tumors with low-risk mutations was more similar to
the response of wtp53-bearing cells, which in agreement with the
mRNA levels and expression array data in that the low-risk
mutations appear to retain some wild-type p53 function. To
compare relative tumor response between tumors to cisplatin,
the area under the tumor growth curve was calculated for each
animal and the mean AUC was plotted for each treated tumor and
their corresponding control (Supplementary Fig. S3). Mice with
tumors that harbor endogenous or exogenous wild-type p53 or
low-risk mutations have a signiﬁcant response (P < 0.0001) to
cisplatin therapy while mice harboring pBabe (null) or high-risk
p53 mutations show minimal growth inhibition with cisplatin

Gene expression array analysis reveals that introduction of high-risk mutations results primarily in a LOF phenotype. A, principal component analysis of the variance
in gene expression between cisplatin-treated HNSCC clones with different p53 status revealed that wtp53 had much larger variance in expression than pBabe
and high-risk p53 mutations (component 1). The low-risk p53 mutations also had more variance in expression than pBabe and high-risk p53 mutations (component 2),
whereas wtp53 and low-risk p53 mutations had less variance compared with each other, indicating that high-risk p53 mutations resemble a LOF. B and

Therefore, a lowest statistical cutoff that corresponded to a false discovery rate of 0.1 was chosen to differentiate between the LOF and GOF phenotypes.

therapy. This gradient of response corroborates the expression
array data and once again implies a partial wild-type p53 function
for the low-risk mutations and lack of p53 function for the highrisk mutations. The resistance to cisplatin seen in the high-risk
mutations was also associated with decreased survival in animals
bearing tumors with high-risk TP53 mutations (Fig. 4D–F). These
results demonstrate that the Evolutionary Action method can
predict the p53 mutations that are least likely to respond to
platinum-based therapy in vivo in an orthotopic murine model
of oral cancer.
EAp53 classiﬁcation predicts response to platinum-based
chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced oral cavity
cancer
To determine the reliability of EAp53 to predict response to
treatment in patients with oral cavity cancer, we identiﬁed a
cohort of patients with locally advanced oral cavity cancer who

1210 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

received platinum-based induction chemotherapy in the context
of prospective clinical trials. This cohort consisted of 68 patients,
of which 26 of the tumor samples (38%) had missense mutations
of TP53, while 42 tumor samples (62%) had wild-type p53 (Table
1). We have shown that the EAp53 system identiﬁed three groups
independently, low EAp53 score, high EAp53 score, and wild-type
p53 (D.M. Neskey and colleagues; submitted for publication).
Univariate analysis in the training set revealed that the low EAp53
score mutations, that is, low risk, and wild-type were not statistically different, whereas the high EAp53 score mutations, termed
high-risk mutations, appeared to be distinct from the other two
groups (D.M. Neskey and colleagues; submitted for publication).
Given the similar outcomes, patients with tumors having low-risk
mutations were combined with wild-type p53 (wtp53). Therefore, the TP53 status was further classiﬁed by EAp53 into low-risk
group (42 wild-type TP53 and 12 low-risk TP53 mutations), and a
high-risk group consists of 14 high-risk TP53 mutations (Table 1

High-risk TP53 mutations are resistant to cisplatin in an orthotopic nude mouse model. A–C, HNSCC cell lines exogenously expressing PCI 13 and UMSCC1 (A and B),
and endogenously HN30 and HN31 (C) expressing p53 were injected into the tongue of nude mice. D–F, Kaplan–Meier curves of the orthotopic tongue model

and Supplementary Table S1). Review of the pathologic ﬁndings
revealed that 13 of the patients (93%) with high-risk TP53
mutations had residual disease, whereas only one patient showed
complete response to cisplatin-based therapy. In contrast, 24 of
the 54 patients (44%) with wild-type p53 and low-risk TP53
mutations achieved complete pathologic response while 30
patients (56%) had residual disease. These data demonstrate that
relative to low-risk TP53, high-risk mutations are greater than 10
fold more likely to have residual disease following cisplatin-based
chemotherapy (Table 1; P ¼ 0.029). EAp53 status was also found
to be better predictor of cisplatin response than the previous
classiﬁcation system developed by Poeta and colleagues (11),
which showed no statistically signiﬁcant association with neoadjuvant response (Table 1; P ¼ 0.248) in our cohort. The other
clinicopathologic data analyzed were not associated with a
response to cisplatin therapy (Table 1). In addition, patients with
tumors having high-risk TP53 mutations appear to have decreased
overall survival relative to patients with low-risk TP53 status (Fig.
5A; P ¼ 0.04) in a Kaplan–Meier analysis. There was also a trend
toward decreased disease-free survival in patients with high-risk
TP53 mutations but it did not reach statistical signiﬁcance

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 5B; P ¼ 0.08). On univariate and multivariate analyses, the
survival beneﬁt of low-risk p53 status in the log rank tests was not
observed in Cox Proportional Hazard Ratio Model (Supplementary Table S2 and S3). Overall, these data provide evidence that
EAp53 can predict a subset of patient with high-risk TP53 mutations that have a decreased response to platinum-based chemotherapy and a poorer overall survival.

Discussion
Currently, there are not any established molecular biomarkers to predict response to chemotherapeutic agents in HNSCC.
Recent whole exome analysis has conﬁrmed that TP53 is the
most frequently mutated gene in HNSCC occurring in 60%–
80% of cases but the challenge remains to identify the mutations associated with resistance to current cytotoxic therapies
and therefore decreased survival outcomes (4, 5). In the current
study, we implemented a novel classiﬁcation system, EAp53,
which has the ability to predict response to cisplatin-based
therapy not only in preclinical models of HNSCC but also in
patients with locally advanced oral cavity squamous cell

The results from this study reveal that relative to wild-type

cisplatin-mediated p21 induction, a known transcriptional target
of p53 in response to cisplatin treatment. In low-risk mutant TP53
cells, this diminished p21 induction appears to be associated with
a reduction in the p21 promoter activity and an intermediate level
of mRNA expression relative to wtp53-expressing cells. In contrast, the cell lines with either exogenous high-risk TP53 mutations

EAp53 Predicts Response to Cisplatin in Head and Neck Cancer

or endogenous mutp53 had decreased p21 promoter activity
following cisplatin treatment as previously described (25, 26).
The functional activity of high TP53 mutations was partially
corroborated by the qRT-PCR results with the high-risk mutations
having a decreased level of target gene expression following
cisplatin treatment. It has been suggested that loss of upregulation
of key p53 target genes may contribute to the GOF phenotype of
some mutp53 (25–28). Although mutated p53 is unable to bind
to sequence speciﬁc DNA of target gene promoters secondary to
alterations in the DNA binding domain, it has been suggested that
p53 either recognizes target promoters independent of this region
or binds the promoters at regions unique from p53-binding sites
(26, 29). Furthermore, the loss of upregulation of p53 target genes
may be enhanced by the constitutive overexpression of mutp53
due to their inability to effectively activate MDM2, a negative
regulator of p53 abundance (30, 31). This latter notion could be
supported by our ﬁnding that cisplatin treatment reduced the
mRNA level of MDM2 in cells expressing low- and high-risk TP53
mutants.
To further assess the effect of suppression of p21 on response to
chemotherapy in the EAp53 high-risk mutations, we show in a
clonogenic survival assay that HNSCC cells expressing low-risk
mutations have an intermediate level of resistance while high-risk
TP53 mutations have a high level of resistance to platinum-based
therapy relative to the pBabe vector control, conﬁrming a GOF
phenotype with regard to cisplatin sensitivity. The differences in
cisplatin sensitivity between the wtp53 and mutp53 may be due in
part to the inhibition of accelerated cellular senescence by mutated p53 (24).
Although our initial in vitro experiments suggested a GOF
phenotype for high-risk TP53 mutations, our attempt to identify
pathways driving this characteristic through expression array
analysis revealed that the introduction of high-risk mutations
actually produces a largely nonfunctional p53 (i.e., suppressed
levels of expression of TP53 target genes) that is most similar to a
complete absence of the protein. Furthermore, the low-risk mutations have distinct expression variances from cells either lacking
p53 or containing a high-risk mutation, which implies this
mutation may retain some wildtype functions. The discrepancy
between the expression array data and the in vitro experiments
could be due to different posttranslational modiﬁcations of the
low- and high-risk mutations that would not be detected on an
mRNA expression array or an altered protein–protein interactome
through which p53 gains function through functionally signiﬁcant interactions with important cellular protein targets (32, 33).
In support of this latter mechanism, we have recently reported that
GOF p53 mutations can bind to and inactivate, the master
metabolic regulatory protein, AMPK, which leads to gain of
oncogenic functions (34).
Furthermore, evidence is now accumulating to indicate that
different p53 mutations possess different functions in different
tissues, potentially reﬂecting differences in the expression of
their cellular targets (35). Therefore, understanding the consequences of each p53 mutation in relationship to disease
progression and response to therapy promises to be an extremely complex undertaking and thus highlights the importance of
our current study.
We further characterized not only the functional spectrum of
p53 mutations but also the ability of EAp53 to predict response to
cisplatin in vivo with an orthotopic nude mouse model of tongue
cancer. These results conﬁrmed that tumors bearing high-risk

www.aacrjournals.org

mutations are more resistant to cisplatin compared with tumors
expressing either wtp53 or low-risk mutant p53. The lack of tumor
response to treatment in mice with high-risk p53-bearing tumors
was similar to tumors lacking p53 expression, which corroborates
the expression array data. In addition to having an improved
tumor response, animals with tumors harboring wtp53 and lowrisk mutations treated with cisplatin had an improved survival
compared with both their untreated controls and the animals with
high-risk p53 tumors.
Finally, in an effort to evaluate the predictive ability of TP53
mutational status stratiﬁed by the EA method, we analyzed a
cohort of patients with locally advanced oral cavity squamous
cell carcinoma who had been treated with platinum-based
neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery (12, 19). This
analysis revealed that EAp53 can identify a population of
patients with high-risk p53 mutations that do not respond to
platinum-based treatment and had decreased overall survival.
Although these results are encouraging, there are limitations to
this study. The percentage of patients with wtp53, 62%, is
higher than expected, which could be attributed to either the
sensitivity of sequencing TP53 from parafﬁn tissues or sequencing exons 5–8, as only approximately 80% of mutations occur
within the DNA-binding domain (36). Therefore, it is possible
that the portion of the wild-type p53 patients' tumors that did
not have a clinical response actually harbored TP53 mutations.
Taken together, these explanations may partly account for not
only the high percentage of wtp53 but also the large number of
wtp53 nonresponders. Nonetheless, EAp53 was predictive of
lack of response to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients
with high-risk mutant p53, and identiﬁed patients with oral
cavity squamous cell carcinoma that have decreased survival.
To further validate these clinical ﬁndings, additional studies of
p53 mutational status in larger cohorts of HNSCC patients that
have received neoadjuvant platinum-based induction therapy
are ongoing.
In summary, the EAp53 model clearly identiﬁes a subset of
high-risk TP53 mutations associated with decreased sensitivity
to cisplatin in preclinical models. In addition, EAp53 can predict
response to treatment and more importantly a survival beneﬁt
for a subset of patients treated with platinum-based therapy. To
fully evaluate the role of EAp53 as a predictive biomarker of
platinum response, prospective clinical trials in which patients'
tumors are stratiﬁed on the basis of their p53 mutational status
and correlated with the response to treatment and survival are
necessary.
