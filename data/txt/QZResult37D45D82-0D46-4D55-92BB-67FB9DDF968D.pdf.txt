Abstract
Preliminary results from a pilot trial on trastuzumab’s mechanism of action against operable breast tumors overexpressing
Her2 suggested a role for antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity
(ADCC). To examine factors affecting ADCC intensity and
variability, we extended this study to the phenotypic and
functional analysis of circulating mononuclear cells in 18
patients. ADCC was induced by trastuzumab therapy in 15 of
18 patients (83%). Inability to develop ADCC in three patients
did not depend on inadequate levels of trastuzumab because
further increase in its concentration in vitro was ineffective.
Rather, susceptibility to develop ADCC was fairly predicted by
test with trastuzumab before therapy and was correlated to the
number of lymphocytes coexpressing CD16 and CD56. Phenotypic analysis at the end of ADCC evaluating down-regulation of
CD16, and up-regulation of CD69 and CD107a, confirmed that
natural killer (NK) cells and CD56+ T cells were involved in
productive engagement of trastuzumab. Also, the killing
efficiency of CD16+ lymphocytes was influenced by 158 V/F
polymorphism of Fc;RIII (CD16), whereas variations of
CD247 on NK cells were consistent with trends between ADCC
before and after therapy. Complete pathologic response was
observed in one patient showing ADCC of outstanding intensity,
whereas four cases of partial response showed intermediate
ADCC; none of the three patients unable to mount ADCC had
significant tumor regression. These data indicate that quantity
and lytic efficiency of CD16+ lymphocytes are major factors for
ADCC induction by trastuzumab, and confirm that breast
cancer responses to short-term trastuzumab monotherapy
may depend on involvement of the ADCC mechanism. [Cancer

Introduction
Clinical studies have shown that trastuzumab can induce
regression of breast cancer (1–5). However, even when patients
are rigorously preselected on the basis of Her2 antigen expression,
not all of them respond to trastuzumab. Indeed, a significant
percentage of patients shows intrinsic primary resistance to

trastuzumab, although the causes of such resistance are currently
unclear (6).
Clinical efficacy of trastuzumab has been postulated to depend
on multiple direct or indirect action mechanism that may produce
cytostatic and/or cytotoxic antitumor cell effects (7). Direct
binding can induce Her-2 down-regulation and alteration of several
Her2-dependent cellular signaling pathways with either cytostatic
or cytotoxic antitumor effects. On the contrary, indirect mechanisms are referred to triggering of immune responses after
trastuzumab engagement through Fc-receptors expressed by
leukocytes, and they are thought to have mainly cytotoxic
antitumor effects. Accordingly, studies in animal models have
shown that a substantial contribution to cytotoxic trastuzumabinduced regression of xenotransplanted tumors is provided by host
immune mechanisms (8), but their role in clinical activity is still
controversial. Among others, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity
(ADCC) is an immune effector mechanism that induces indirect
tumor cell killing very efficiently and, in so doing, may also mediate
cytocidal tumor regression caused by trastuzumab and other
mAbs. However, evaluation of ADCC in metastatic breast cancer
patients treated with a combination of trastuzumab and interleukin-2 (IL-2) or IL-12 did not confirm a correlation with clinical
responses (9–11). However, later studies in early-stage breast
cancer treated before surgery with trastuzumab as a single agent
reported data suggesting a role for ADCC. In particular, we have
found that patients induced to complete or partial remission by
trastuzumab alone were found to have higher ADCC and higher
in situ infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes, including natural
killer (NK) cells (12). Likewise, even when used in combination
with docetaxel, neoadjuvant trastuzumab treatment was found to
be associated with significantly increased numbers of tumorassociated NK cells and increased lymphocyte expression of
cytotoxic activity markers compared with controls (13). Moreover,
a study on the action mechanism of trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant
setting confirmed that tumor regression is dependent on a cytocidal
rather than cytostatic antitumor effect and suggested that this effect
is mediated by programmed cell death (apoptosis; ref. 5).
Interestingly, this latter evidence is not inconsistent with a supposed
role for ADCC because apoptosis may also represent the final
common death pathway for ADCC-mediated cytotoxicity (14).
When assuming that ADCC may constitute a mechanism
involved in trastuzumab activity, its efficacy may depend on both
humoral and cellular factors. Humoral factors such as plasma
monoclonal antibody (mAb) concentration is thought to be critical
not only in absolute terms but also in relative terms of competition
with autologous IgG1 immunoglobulins for binding to low-affinity

Fc-g receptor type III (CD16; ref. 15). Similarly, the array of cellular
effectors potentially exerting ADCC includes not only CD3 CD56+
NK lymphocytes (16), but also CD3+CD16+ T-cell subset (17),
CD16+CD33+ macrophages (18), and CD16+ granulocytes (19).
Finally, the Fc-receptor binding affinity for IgG1 is diverged by
genetic polymorphism such as CD16-158V/F (20, 21). Indeed, a
higher affinity of CD16-158V/V has been reported to correlate with
improved clinical responses observed after IgG1 mAb immunotherapy in some instances (22–24) but not in others (25, 26). On
the whole, ADCC can be considered as the sum of several factors;
however, it remains to be determined which is the specific
contribution of each of these in individual patients with an
established disease once therapy is under way and possibly without
the immunosuppressive effects of other drugs.
In this study, we have analyzed the intensity of ADCC in patients
with primary operable breast tumors overexpressing HER2 before
and after short-term preoperative therapy with trastuzumab as
single agent. We found broad individual variability of ADCC levels
that was significantly related to the number of CD16+CD56+
effector lymphocytes, but not to trastuzumab serum levels. Such
variability was confirmed to correlate with trastuzumab clinical
activity especially at the upper and lower limits of ADCC activity.
These data can provide potentially useful insights for understanding the causes of intrinsic primary resistance to trastuzumab and
increase the efficacy of short-term trastuzumab-based treatments.

Materials and Methods
Patients. From May 2002 to June 2005, 18 patients with primary operable
breast cancer classified as HER2-positive tumors (herceptest/3+ or
herceptest/2+ along with positive fluorescence in situ hybridization testing)
on the basis of core biopsy pathologic analysis were enrolled in a study
protocol of preoperative trastuzumab therapy as a single agent, as
previously described elsewhere (12). The study protocol was approved by
the institutional review board, and patients were enrolled after obtaining
informed consent. After completion of clinical assessment and core biopsy
evaluation, patients received preoperative trastuzumab (Herceptin, kindly
provided by Roche S.p.A.) as a single loading dose of 4 mg/kg, followed
by three weekly treatments at 2 mg/kg. Left ventricular ejection fraction
was determined at baseline and before surgical treatment. Responses to
trastuzumab therapy were evaluated based on a clinical, pathologic, and
bidimensional radiologic/ultrasound examination of the tumor before and
after treatment, and were classified according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (27). Surgery was performed 1 week after the last
dose. After surgery, patients received adjuvant treatment in accordance with
standard practice guidelines. Blood samples were collected in all patients
immediately before beginning the trastuzumab therapy and 1 week after the
last treatment.
Isolation of patients’ sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Two distinct aliquots of peripheral blood, without and with anticoagulant,
were drawn from patients before and after therapy with trastuzumab.
Peripheral blood collected without anticoagulant was used for separation of
autologous serum, which was further incubated for 30 min at 56jC to
inactivate complement; the separated serum was finally frozen at 80jC
until use. Concomitantly, the peripheral blood collected in the anticoagulant was used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by
standard Ficoll gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque, Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech). After centrifugation, PBMCs were washed with a medium
containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), resuspended in
90% FBS + 10% DMSO solution on ice at a cell concentration <10  106/mL
and, lastly, frozen in liquid nitrogen after intermediate cooling at 80jC in
a methanol-containing device. The viability of PBMCs after thawing was
consistently higher than 85% to 90%, as evaluated by flow cytometry with
standard propidium iodide incorporation.

Evaluation of patients’ ADCC. The objective to reestablish conditions
in vitro as close as possible to those in vivo was pursued by testing PBMC
against an Her2-overexpressing target cell line in the presence of
simultaneously harvested autologous serum. To obtain a reliable comparison between ADCC before and after therapy, PBMCs isolated from the
same patient, but at different times, were thawed and tested in parallel
in the same experiment. ADCC by trastuzumab was measured in a shortterm 51Cr release assay using radiolabeled target cells from the Her2overexpressing MDA-MB361 human breast cancer cell line. To this end,
1 million MDA-MB361 target cells in exponential growth were labeled with
100 ACi (3.7 MBq) of Na51Cr (Amersham International) for 1 h at 37jC,
washed extensively, and used as targets. Five thousand 51Cr-labeled target
cells per well were seeded into 96-well U-bottomed plates. Experiments
were conducted in triplicates at various PBMC (effector) to MDA-MB361
(target) ratios of 6:1; 12.5:1; 25:1, and 50:1, in 200 AL of RPMI 1640 containing
20% autologous human serum. The antibody source for evaluation of
patients’ ADCC was made up, respectively, of Herceptin (same as for clinical
use, aliquoted in saline and stored as working solution; kindly provided by
Roche), autologous serum of treated patients, or both. Experiments
conducted in a preliminary phase to select optimal conditions for the
antibody-dependent cytotoxicity effect showed that (a) target cells were not
killed after exposure to trastuzumab or serum in the absence of PBMC
effectors; (b) the coating of effectors with trastuzumab followed by the
removal of soluble mAb in excess provided negligible target cell killing; and
(c) the coating of target cells with trastuzumab followed by the removal of
soluble mAb in excess contributed only limited target cells killing, whereas
(d) the persistence of soluble trastuzumab during the assay not only
reproduced more closely the in vivo situation but also represented the
condition providing the highest killing of target cells (data not shown).
When testing for different trastuzumab concentrations as well as different
concentrations of autologous serum, we found that either 1 to 10 Ag/mL of
trastuzumab or 10% to 20% of posttherapy patients’ sera were optimal
sources for saturating ADCC assay by PBMC (data not shown). Thus, all
ADCC experiments were carried out in the presence of 20% autologous
serum, without or with 10 Ag/mL of trastuzumab added exogenously. After
4 h at 37jC in humidified air with 8% CO2, the release of 51Cr into
supernatants was determined in Lumaplate 96 scintillation plates, and
counted by a TopCount gamma counter (Packard Instruments Company).
Maximal and spontaneous 51Cr release values were obtained by adding
either 1% NP40 detergent (BDH Biochemicals) or complete medium,
respectively, to microtiter wells containing 5  103 labeled target cells.
The percentage of lysis was calculated according to the standard formula =
100  (cpm experimental
cpm spontaneous release) / (cpm maximum
release cpm spontaneous release).
Flow cytometry analysis of PBMC effectors for ADCC. A sixparameter flow cytometric analysis of thawed PBMC was performed using
a two-laser FACSCalibur instrument equipped with CellQuest software
(BD Biosciences). Instrument setting and compensation were established as
described previously (28). Data acquisition was always done immediately
after staining procedures. To identify phenotype modifications of effector
lymphocytes involved in trastuzumab-mediated cytotoxicity, 4  105 of the
same thawed PBMCs prepared for use in ADCC assay were left in parallel
cultures with unlabeled MDA-MB361 target cells at an effector-to-target
ratio of 25:1 in the absence (negative control) or presence of trastuzumab
(10 Ag/mL), in otherwise identical culture conditions of ADCC assay. A
further fraction of such cultures was dedicated to testing of CD107a
mobilization by adding 1 Ag/106 cells of anti-CD107a FITC-conjugated
(mouse IgG1, H4A3, BD PharMingen) at the beginning of culture. At the end
of culture, cells were harvested, washed, and directly stained with 1 Ag/106
cells of each of the following mAbs: anti-CD3 conjugated to allophycocyanin
(UCHT1, mouse IgG1, BD PharMingen), anti-CD56 conjugated to Rphycoerythrin cyanin 5.1 (N901, mouse IgG1, Beckman-Coulter), antiCD16 conjugated to R-phycoerythrin (3G8, mouse IgG1, BD PharMingen),
and anti-CD69 conjugated to FITC (FN50, mouse IgG1, BD PharMingen), or
with isotype-matched mAbs of irrelevant specificity R-phycoerythrin– and
FITC-conjugated as negative controls for anti-CD16 and anti-CD69,
respectively. To identify the frequency of effector NK and T populations

ADCC in Patients Under Trastuzumab Therapy
among PBMC submitted to ADCC assay, an aliquot of the same thawed
PBMC prepared for use as effectors in ADCC were washed in calciummagnesium–free PBS containing 5% FBS and mouse serum, and directly
stained with mAbs anti-CD3 (allophycocyanin), anti-CD56 (PC5), and antiCD16 (R-phycoerythrin). For evaluation of CD247 (TcR ~-chain) expression
intensity on T and NK cells, PBMC freshly isolated by Ficoll gradient after
venipunctures obtained from eight patients ( from patient 11 through
patient 18) were submitted for direct surface staining with anti-CD3 plus
anti-CD56, washed, fixed, and permeabilized (Fix&Perm, Caltag Laboratories), and incubated either with anti-CD247 (MCA1297F, mouse IgG2a,
FITC-conjugated; Serotec), or a mouse IgG2a-FITC mAbs of irrelevant
specificity (negative control). The expression intensity of CD247, defined
separately on T and NK cells, was obtained as the ratio between mean
fluorescence intensity of anti-CD247 and that of its negative control, as
described elsewhere (29).
Characterization of Fc;RIIIA-158 V/F polymorphism. The FCRgIIIA158V/F polymorphism was determined by two methods: at the genotypic
level in the first 10 recruited patients and at the phenotypic level in all 18
patients. The 158V/F genetic polymorphism of FCGR3A was characterized on
genomic DNA extracted from thawed PBMC using minor modifications of
standard procedures for peripheral blood. Genotyping of FcgR3A 158V/F
polymorphism was performed using a nested PCR followed by allele-specific
restriction enzyme digestion. Two specific FcgR3A primers (5-ATATTTACAGAATGGCACAGG-3 and 5-GACTTGGTACCCAGGTTGAA-3) were used to
amplify a 1.2-kb fragment containing the polymorphic site. The initial PCR
assay was performed with 1.25 Ag genomic DNA, 200 ng of each primer,
200 Amol/L of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 1 Amol/L
MgCl2, and 1 unit Taq DNA polymerase. This first PCR consisted of 10 min
at 95jC, then 35 cycles (each consisting of steps at 95jC for 1 min, 57jC for
1.5 min, and 72jC for 1.5 minutes), and 8 min at 72jC to achieve complete
extension. The second PCR used primers (5-ATCAGATTCGATCCTACTTCTGCAGGGGGCAT-3; 5-ACGTGCTGAGCTTGAGTGATGGTGATGTTCAC-3) amplifying a 94-bp fragment and creating a Nla III
restriction site only in the FcgR3A-158V allele. This nested PCR was performed with 1 AL of the amplified DNA, 150 ng of each primer, 200 Amol/L of
each dNTP, 1.5 Amol/L MgCl2, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The first
cycle consisted of 5 min at 95jC, then 35 cycles (each consisting of steps at
95jC for 1 min, 62jC for 1 min, and 72jC for 1 min), and 9.5 min at 72jC to
complete extension. The amplified DNA (10 AL) was then digested with
10 units NlaIII at 37jC for 12 h and separated by electrophoresis on 8%
polyacrylamide gel. After staining with ethidium bromide, DNA bands were
visualized under UV light. For homozygous FcgR3A-158F patients, only one
undigested band (94 bp) was visible. Three bands (94, 61, and 33 bp) were seen
in heterozygous individuals, whereas for homozygous FcgR3A-158V patients
only two digested bands (61 and 33 bp) were obtained.
Evaluation of FCRgIIIA-158V/F phenotypic polymorphism was done in
all patients on PBMC by using flow cytometry assay described by Bottcher
et al. (30) by two anti-FCRgIIIA mAbs: 3G8 (mouse IgG1, FITC-conjugated,
BD PharMingen) and MEM-154 (mouse IgG1, FITC-conjugated, Immunological Sciences). As reported, 3G8 mAb binds to a nonpolymorphic
epitope of FCRgIIIA with invariable affinity and regardless of 158-F/V
polymorphism, whereas the binding of MEM-154 mAb to its epitope on
FCRgIIIA is dependent on valine amino acid expression at 158-F/V. The
differential binding of the two mAbs used in parallel, expressed as the
ratio between the mean fluorescence intensities of their conjugated
fluorochromes, allows to distinguish three different phenotypes: F/F
(MEM-154/3G8 ratio <0.04), V/V (ratio >0.62), and F/V (ratio between 0.15
and 0.48). The accordance between results on FCRgIIIA-158V/F polymorphism obtained separately by the genotypic and phenotypic methods in
the first 10 patients was absolute. Patients 11 to 18 were characterized by
flow cytometry alone.
Statistical analysis. To compare ADCC of each patient observed at
different times or with versus without trastuzumab, paired analysis was
performed using Student’s t test. Nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test
was used to compare data between groups. Correlations were analyzed by
Spearman’s correlation coefficient test. Statistical tests were performed with
Stat-View software, and P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Analysis of trastuzumab-dependent ADCC in patients with
operable breast cancer overexpressing Her2. The first objective
was to evaluate the effect of trastuzumab therapy on ADCC in
patients having effector cells not altered by any other previous
therapy. As shown in Fig. 1A, ADCC activity exerted by PBMC in
the presence of autologous sera increased significantly after
4 weeks of therapy with trastuzumab in 15 of 18 (83%) patients
enrolled in the study. Basal ADCC activity before therapy was
negligible (<10%) in all patients but one. Patient 1 showed not only
high spontaneous cytotoxic activity but also maximal response
after therapy. Most other patients induced intermediate lysis of
target cells. In the remaining three cases (patients 4, 8, and 18), no
significant increase was induced after therapy. Overall, the increase
was significant when considering collectively all patients (P < 0.001,
Fig. 1A, right), thus confirming that short-term therapy with
trastuzumab was active at inducing ADCC activity. However, given
the wide variability ranging from maximal response (one patient)
to unresponsiveness (three patients), these data also indicated that
the susceptibility to developing ADCC was not universal and highly
heterogeneous.
The second objective was to evaluate the distinct contribution of
trastuzumab-containing serum to ADCC heterogeneity to clarify
whether low responses could be caused by inadequate availability
of trastuzumab after therapy. To this end, we conducted parallel
assays with saturated concentration in vitro. As shown in Fig. 1B,
results obtained with autologous sera after therapy alone and with
further addition of trastuzumab were highly correlated and
definitely overlapping. Similarly, the ADCC activity of PBMC from
poorly responsive patients could not be restored by adding serum
from the patient with the highest ADCC response (not shown).
Conversely, when we tested PBMC from patients after therapy in
the presence of medium supplemented only with FBS or
heterologous human serum from untreated donors, ADCC activity
was abolished (not shown). These data confirmed the essential role
of trastuzumab in conferring activity in ADCC assay, but ruled out
the possibility that either unresponsiveness or low responses could
depend on inadequate drug pharmacokinetic.
Thereafter, we asked whether individual potential for trastuzumab-dependent ADCC might be constitutive to each patient, thus
preexisting the therapy and possibly predicted by testing PBMC
before therapy in the presence of saturated amounts of trastuzumab.
As shown in Fig. 1C, the equivalence between values observed before
therapy and those observed after therapy was not absolute but still
significant. This correlation suggests that this individual characteristic can be roughly predicted at least on a short-term basis and can
possibly distinguish high from intermediate and low ADCC
responders.
Analysis of cellular and molecular variables affecting
individual variability of trastuzumab-dependent ADCC. To
identify effector cells responsible for trastuzumab-dependent
short-term responses, we analyzed the phenotype of lymphocytes
cultured for ADCC assay. We focused the analysis on CD56+CD3
NK cells, CD3+CD56+ T cells, and CD3+CD56 T cells (Fig. 2,
first row from the top). The CD56+CD3 NK cell population showed
a remarkable down-modulation of CD16 in the presence of
target cells and trastuzumab (Fig. 2, second row, thick lines). Such
down-modulation was specific for productive engagement of
CD16 by trastuzumab, because it was not observed when PBMC
were cultured in the presence of either target cells (thin lines) or
trastuzumab alone (not shown). Similarly, NK cells also showed

specific up-regulation of CD69 early activation antigen (Fig. 2,
third row) and expression of CD107a (Fig. 2, fourth row), a
molecule linked to the killing activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes.
The CD3+CD56+ T-cell subset also showed similar phenotypic
modifications, but to a lesser extent. By contrast, CD3+CD56
T cells showed no expression of CD16 and did not up-regulate
either CD69 or CD107a. Therefore, we hypothesized that patients’
ADCC heterogeneity might have been related to the proportion
of putative effector lymphocytes constituted by NK and T cells
coexpressing CD16 and CD56. The most evident correlation
between target lysis and effector lymphocytes was found in patient
1 (Fig. 3, first row from the top), who revealed coexisting
outstanding levels of ADCC and effector lymphocytes. Nevertheless,
other patients with intermediate and low ADCC levels also had
intermediate and low quantity of effectors, respectively (Fig. 3,
second and third row). The correlation between percentages of
CD16+CD56+ effectors in PBMC used for ADCC and ADCC itself
was statistically significant before and, although to a lesser
degree, also after therapy (Fig. 4B). On the whole, these findings
confirmed that NK and T cells expressing CD16 constitute the
effector lymphocytes mainly involved in short-term trastuzumabdependent cytotoxicity, and their variability explained, at least
partially, the patients’ ADCC heterogeneity.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

To gain further insights into other factors possibly affecting
individual variability, we explored the potential involvement of
CD16 V/F polymorphism at position 158. Patients were found to be
distributed unequally among the three allelic groups: VV (three
patients only), VF (patient 10), and FF (patient 5; Table 1). When
we searched for differences between ADCC levels of the three
groups, we found no differences (not shown) probably because
the quantity of effector CD16+CD56+ lymphocytes was not consistent with CD16 polymorphism. By contrast, when target cell lysis
(ADCC) data were normalized for a fixed number of effector cells,
we found some preliminary evidence that the killing efficiency of
CD16+CD56+ cells in the presence of trastuzumab and sera of
patients bearing VV alleles was higher than those with VF and FF
alleles (Fig. 4C). However, such a relationship between CD16-158V/
F polymorphism and the killing efficiency of CD16+CD56+ cells was
somewhat weaker in the same patients after therapy (not shown).
This latter inconsistency that emerged between observations made
before and after therapy added to those previously mentioned
about the weakened relationships between ADCC and CD16+CD56+
effectors (Fig. 4A and B). Thus, we examined some parameters
that could contribute to explaining ADCC alterations occurring
with therapies, such as the number of accessory myeloid cells in
PBMC, the expression on NK cells and CD56+ T cells of short- and

long-term activation markers, of perforin content, and the expression
of CD247 (the ~-chain for signal transduction of T-cell receptor and
CD16). None of these parameters revealed any significant relationship
(data not shown), except for CD247 expression. As shown in
Fig. 4D, the last eight patients recruited were tested, and a significant
correlation was found between ADCC variation (before versus after
therapy) and the CD247 expression intensity variation on NK cells
(before versus after therapy), but not on T cells (not shown).
These latter findings suggest that the variation of potential ADCC
observed with therapy may be related to parallel variations of
CD247, the signal-transducing molecule for CD16 on NK cells.
Insights on the relationship between ADCC potential and
the therapeutic outcome of short-term trastuzumab monotherapy in patients with operable breast cancer overexpressing Her2. The evaluation of clinical responses in terms of tumor

reduction reported one complete pathologic response, four partial
responses, and 12 patients with stable disease (Table 1). The most
relevant association between ADCC and clinical response occurred
for the patient with maximal ADCC activity (Fig. 3), who revealed
pathologic complete response when residual tumor mass was
analyzed after surgery. This patient underwent local irradiation
after surgery, and remained free from disease after 5 years of
follow-up. In the remaining cases, a significant degree of ADCC
activity was commonly observed in patients with partial response
(patients 2, 6, 10, and 13). After surgery, these patients received
adjuvant treatments in accordance with standard practice guidelines. Patients 2 and 10 remained free from disease after near
5 years of follow-up; patient 6 developed bone metastases 13
months after surgery, and patient 13 was lost to follow-up after
adjuvant treatment. As opposed to cases developing significant

Fig. 3) showed evidence of significant tumor regression (Table 1).
As a result, the emerging relationship suggests a correlation at
the upper and lower limits as in one case extremely high ADCC
was associated with effective antitumor response, whereas
extremely low ADCC was associated with ineffective antitumor
responses.

Discussion
This study reports the analysis of ADCC induced by trastuzumab
in a group of patients with operable breast cancer overexpressing
Her2. Analysis was carried out on PBMC isolated from patients
once therapy was under way, without interference deriving from
other previous or concomitant antineoplastic therapies. Under
these conditions, some patients were unable to acquire significant
ADCC, whereas most patients developed low-to-intermediate
ADCC levels, and one outstanding case showed maximal activity.
This unexpected extreme variability was further dissected as the
sum of cellular and humoral factors to clarify the origins of such
heterogeneity and the importance of parameters influencing the
clinical efficacy of ADCC by trastuzumab.
The influence of humoral factors on ADCC can involve several
aspects. First of all, ADCC is related to mAb concentration in a
dose-dependent manner (21). In addition, various soluble elements
are known to inhibit ADCC in vivo. Endogenous IgGs can compete
with IgG mAbs for binding to various classes of FcgRs, in particular
with FcgRIII (15, 31, 32). Moreover, shedded FcgRIII can also act as
a decoy element partially neutralizing the Fc part of mAbs and

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

other IgGs (33). Finally, Her2 can also be shedded in plasma in
patients with breast cancer expressing high levels of this (34). All of
these soluble elements may limit the productive interaction
between FcgRIII (CD16) and the Fc portion of mAb bound to
tumor cells. To take into account these potential effects and
reproduce in vitro the ADCC activity developed in vivo by each
patient, we conducted functional assays in the presence of a
substantial concentration of complement-inactivated autologous
serum harvested at the same time as the effector cells. In these
conditions, we found that even when further adding trastuzumab
at a concentration sufficient to restore maximal cell lysis (15),
ADCC intensity was not modified in a significant manner (Fig. 1B).
These results indicated that trastuzumab concentration under
therapy was not inadequate and also suggested that other soluble
inhibitory factors were probably not accountable for low-to-absent
ADCC induction observed in some patients.
The evaluation of the cellular contribution to ADCC in patients
under mAb therapy is complex because of many cell types
expressing FcgRs that can engage mAbs of the IgG class (16–19).
Through the analysis of PBMC, we have found indirect but clear
evidences that CD16+CD56+ NK and T lymphocytes, both of which
are specialized for killing, were involved in ADCC (Figs. 2 and 3).
The individual heterogeneity of ADCC was significantly dependent
on the quantity of CD16+CD56+ lymphocytes among PBMC (Figs. 3
and 4A and B). Another level of individual heterogeneity was
related to the killing efficiency of CD16+CD56+ lymphocytes and
possibly to their FcgRIIIa 158 V/F polymorphism (Fig. 4C). Such a
relationship between FcgRIIIa 158 V/F polymorphism and killing
efficiency for ADCC is consistent with previous studies showing an
increased affinity for IgG1 mAbs by subjects bearing FcgRIII 158

ADCC in Patients Under Trastuzumab Therapy

VV alleles (20, 21, 35). However, the overall effect of killing
efficiency on whole ADCC, as opposed to the quantity of
CD16+CD56+ lymphocytes, was not substantial in this limited
cohort because patients with the highest ADCC (including
patient 1) were distinct from those with the highest killing
efficiency (including patients 7 and 17), and vice versa for low
responders. Ultimately, the whole ADCC response was the product
of the quantity and efficiency of CD16+CD56+ lymphocytes, but the
influence of the quantity appeared more relevant than efficiency.
Such influence of the effector cell number might depend on the
peculiar protocol, which included patients with unaffected immune
system, whereas killing efficiency may play a more relevant role in
patients rendered lymphopenic by cytotoxic agents because of
advanced disease. Nevertheless, these data draw attention to the
relevance of effector cell numbers when considering the ADCC
mechanism of action.
The prediction of ADCC intensity by preliminary assay before
therapy may represent an instrument to classify patients more or
less likely to benefit from the ADCC mechanism of action mediated
by trastuzumab. In spite of the typical variability intrinsic to most
functional cell assay, we observed that it was possible to identify at
least patients with extremely high or low susceptibility toward
developing ADCC responses after short-term therapy with
trastuzumab (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest that an integrated
evaluation of ADCC along with the quantification of effector
CD16+CD56+ lymphocytes and FcgRIII polymorphisms should

provide a way in the future to estimate patients’ tendencies to
develop potential ADCC responses in vivo under therapy with
trastuzumab.
The role of ADCC or other indirect immune-mediated mechanisms in clinical activity of trastuzumab is still being debated and it
is difficult to definitely prove. However, next to elegant demonstrations in animal models, recent clinical studies have also
provided preliminary evidences that NK cells can be activated (36)
and recruited (12, 13) by trastuzumab therapy, whereas other
emerging studies are ready to report a correlation between clinical
outcomes and FcgRs polymorphisms in advanced stages of the
disease (37). Hence, the question probably is not if ADCC can be
triggered against established breast cancer, but rather when and
how much ADCC can be efficacious at the clinical level, or at which
preferential stages of the disease, or with which drug combination,
and so forth. In this report, we confirmed and extended our
previous findings (12) on the correlation existing between ADCC
and response to trastuzumab in the preoperative setting. It should
be noted that this setting may be considered favorable to
document the specific contribution from the ADCC mechanism
because the immune system mechanisms are still intact, and
because the tumor regression seen after such a short treatment is
more likely related to cytocidal killing–dependent event than to
cytostatic events by trastuzumab. Under these circumstances, the
potential for ADCC expressed by PBMC was extraordinarily high in
a patient showing pathologic complete response, but it was absent

in three patients (patients 4, 8, and 18) and extremely low in
another patient (patient 9), all of whom lacked evidences of
significant tumor regression (Table 1). Moreover, although many
patients clustered their ADCC quite narrowly and intermediate
ADCC activity was scarcely predictive for clinical activity, it should
be noted that all patients with significant antitumor response
(Table 1) also had considerable ADCC (Fig. 1). In the end, the
relationship was particularly evident not only for the patient
showing extremely high ADCC, but also for the unfortunate but
more common cases of absent or low ADCC activity. This latter
observation raises the possibility that low ADCC may be at the
origin of some cases of intrinsic primary resistance to trastuzumab.
In conclusion, this study indicates that the systemic potential to
exert CD16-dependent ADCC, a lytic attack on antibody-targeted
cells, in patients with established breast cancer under treatment
with trastuzumab is highly heterogeneous, primarily dependent on
the availability of functional effector cells, and fairly predictable
in vitro within a short time from the beginning of therapy. By

contrast, the availability of circulating trastuzumab should not be
considered a limiting factor for ADCC when weekly administrations
at common dosages are used. The coincidence of maximal ADCC
with pathologic complete response and of low-to-absent ADCC
with a lack of clinical response suggests that high or low ADCC can
either add or limit trastuzumab clinical activity, respectively. These
observations contribute to identifying patients with opposite
susceptibilities to developing ADCC with short-term trastuzumab,
to further clarifying the role played by ADCC in trastuzumab
therapy, and possibly to optimizing the therapeutic efficiency of
trastuzumab in breast cancer patients overexpressing Her2.
