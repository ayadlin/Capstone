ABSTRACT
The overall survival of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been
improved significantly over the last decade. Molecularly targeted agents hold promise
to change the therapeutic landscape in AML. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
controls a plethora of biological process through switching on and off its long list of
target genes. In AML, constitutive NF-κB has been detected in 40% of cases and its
aberrant activity enable leukemia cells to evade apoptosis and stimulate proliferation.
These facts suggest that NF-κB signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in the
development of AML and it represents an attractive target for the intervention of
AML. This review summarizes our current knowledge of NF-κB signaling transduction
including canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. Then we specifically highlight
what factors contribute to the aberrant activation of NF-κB activity in AML, followed
by an overview of 8 important clinical trials of the first FDA approved proteasome
inhibitor, Bortezomib (Velcade®), which is a NF-κB inhibitor too, in combination with
other therapeutic agents in patients with AML. Finally, this review discusses the future
directions of NF-κB inhibitor in treatment of AML, especially in targeting leukemia
stem cells (LSCs).

INTRODUCTION

copies of the ankyrin repeats, a 33-residue sequence motif,
which is also found in Inhibitor of κB family members
[9-11].
In unstimulated state, NF-κB complexes are
sequestered in the cytoplasm by Inhibitor of kappa-B (IκB), which mask the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of
NF-κB [12-14]. Upon activation of NF-κB, an upstream
IB kinase phosphorylates IκBs at the critical amino acid
residues (Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκBα; Ser-19 and Ser23 of IκBβ), which are subsequently ubiquitinated by
β-transducin repeat-containing protein (βTrCP) and then
degraded by the 26S proteasome, allowing freed NF-κB
dimers to translocate to the nucleus and transactivate κBresponsive elements [3, 15-17].
NF-κB signaling can occur through either the
canonical or non-canonical pathways (Figure 1) [18-21].

The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a dimeric
transcription factor which plays versatile crucial roles
in a plethora of normal cellular functions by controlling
a panoply of downstream genes [1-4]. This proinflammatory transcription factor consists of rel family
proteins, which are related through a highly conserved
DNA-binding/dimerization domain called the Rel
homology (RH) domain [5]. Currently, five mammalian
NF-κB family members have been identified and studied.
These include NF-κB1 (p50/p105), NF-κB2 (p52/p100),
RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel [6-8]. The C-terminal regions
of RelA, RelB and c-Rel contain a transactivating domain
that is important for NF-κB-mediated gene transactivation,
while the C-termini of p105 and p100 contain multiple

These two pathways have different 1) activating stimuli, 2)
IKK activating complexes, 3) DNA-binding heterodimers
and 4) gene target [22]. The details of these two pathways
were summarized in Table 1.
NF-κB signaling pathway has been shown to
regulate cell survival and apoptosis. Activation of
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to increase nitric
oxide (NO) has been described as a pro-apoptotic function
of NF-κB activation [23-25]. However, a study by Brandão
et.al reported high iNOS expression in blood samples of
AML patients in comparison to controls, which makes this
apoptotic pathway questionable [26]. It is possible that
acute production of NO triggers apoptosis, in contrast,
the chronic production of NO by constitutively activate
NF-κB signaling could inhibit the programmed suicide
[26]. On the other hand, it is generally accepted that NFκB activation is responsible for apoptosis resistance, cell
proliferation and invasiveness [27-29]. Many tumours
have been reported to show upregulation of a large
number of NFκB target genes, for examples, FLICE-like
inhibitory protein (FLIP), Inhibitors of Apoptosis (IAPs)
and some members of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family to
inhibit apoptosis; cyclin D1, c-myc and c-myb to enhance

cell proliferation; and cell adhesion molecules (ICAM1, E-selectin), matrix metalloproteinases and several
angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) to promote cancer cell invasion [27, 3035].
It has been well known that Heme oxygenase-1
(HO-1) is an evolutionarily conserved key enzyme that
catabolizes free heme [36]. Free heme is lipophilic, so
it causes damage in lipid bilayers of cellular membrane,
intracellular organelles [37]. Thus, HO-1 has function
in protecting cells from apoptosis by escalating free
heme catabolism. HO-1 promoter region contains NFκB
responsive element and HO-1 expression is regulated by
NFκB, in collaboration with other transcription factors
[38]. In AML, induction of HO-1 expression has been
reported as the mechanism by which AML cells evade
tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF)-induced apoptosis [39], as
well as chemotherapy-induced apoptosis [40]. Therefore,
it appears an attractive approach by targeting both NFκB
and HO-1 for anti-AML therapy [41].

Molecular mechanisms of aberrant activation of
NF-κB in AML

common myeloid progenitor (CMP) and the granulocytemonocyte progenitor (GMP) [55, 56]. Consistent with
this expression pattern, the study of C/EBPα knock-out
mice shows that deletion of C/EBPα selectively blocks
myeloid differentiation at transition stage and reduces
formation of neutrophils and monocytes [58]. Mutations
in the C/EBPα gene have been detected in 10 - 15% of
patients with AML [59]. Except for some rare types of
mutations, C/EBPα mutations can be classified into two
main categories: (1) N-terminal mutations that lead to
premature termination of protein translation, resulting
in translation of a dominant negative, short C/EBPα p30
isoform; (2) C-terminal mutations that disrupt the bZIP
region, resulting loss of DNA binding capacity [60, 61].
The majority of AML patients with C/EBPα mutations
have double mutations, i.e., two allele carrying different
types of mutations. However, some patients harbor
single mutation on one allele only. Of note, only double
mutations, but not single mutation of C/EBPα, are
associated with favorable prognosis [59, 62]. C/EBPα and
its mutant forms, harboring with N-terminal mutations or
C-terminal mutations, interact with NFκB components in
AML cells [63]. Several lines of evidence indicate that C/
EBPα, as well as its mutant variants, interacts with NFκB
p50 and induces a subset of NFκB target genes, including
pro-survival Bcl-2, FLIP, through promoter binding [63,
64]. Saturating mutagenesis analysis shows that some
key residues in the basic region of bZIP domain of C/
EBPα is critical for the interaction with NFκB p50 [65].
The expression of C/EBPα is 3-fold lower in NFκB p50
knockout cells and p50 binds to the promoter of C/EBPα
αand regulates its expression [66]. On the other hand, C/
EBPα and its mutant forms can replace histone deacetylase
1 to 3 on the p50 promoter, inducing p50 expression and
activating NFκB activity in AML [67].

Constitutive activity of NF-κB is frequently
observed in different types of cancer and has been
correlated with resistance of cancer cells to radiation
and chemotherapies [15, 16, 23, 42-46]. Causes of such
aberrant activity could be due to alterations of genes that
encode NF-κB and/or its inhibitors that promote NF-κB
activation; constitutive activation of IKKs that accelerate
IκB phosphorylation following degradation; or exposure
to inflammatory stimuli in the tumour microenvironment
that constantly trigger the signaling pathway. About 40%
of patients with AML have shown increased activity of
NF-κB [47]. Here we will discuss various mechanisms
leading to aberrant activation of this pathway in AML.

ATM
Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) gene encodes
a serine/threonine protein kinase, which is a master
regulator of cell cycle checkpoint in response to DNA
damage for the maintenance of genomic stability [4850]. The development of AML involves multiple steps
of genetic and epigenetic changes, including activation
of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes
[51]. These activated oncogenes in AML cells often
induce oxidative stress (high production of reactive
oxygen species, ROS) and replication stress, triggering
DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, which, in turn,
results in phosphorylation of ATM, CHK-1, CHK-2 and
H2AX [52, 53]. In AML cells, phosphorylated (activated)
ATM interacts with NFκB essential modulator (NEMO),
a subunit of IκB kinase complex, and p53-induced death
domain protein (PIDD) in the nucleus. Both NEMO and
PIDD activate NFκB pathway [54]. Treatment of AML
cells with pharmacological inhibitors of ATM or siRNA
silencing ATM induces relocalization of NFκB from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm, resulting in apoptosis of AML
cells [54]. These results suggest constitutively active ATM
leads to activate NFκB pathway in AML.

RUNX1
RUNX1 (runt-related transcription factor 1) is
heterodimeric transcription factor belonging to RUNX
gene family (RUNX1, 2, 3). RUNX1 plays a pivotal role
in development of definitive hematopoiesis and primitive
hematopoiesis [68-71]. Chromosomal abnormalities
or point mutation involved in RUNX1 gene define a
prognosis and biology distinct subset of AML patients [72,
73]. In mouse RUNX-1 deficient hematopoietic progenitor
cells, both canonical and noncanonical pathways of NFκB signaling are constitutively increased as evidenced
by increased nuclear localization of p65 and p52
proteins [74]. Wild type RUNX1 binds to IKK complex
in the cytoplasm and attenuates its kinase activity, thus
repressing NFκB signaling. However, mutant RUNX1
forms lose the ability to inhibit IKK, leading to aberrant
activation of NFκB pathway in AML cases with RUNX1
abnormalities [74].

C/EBPα
CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/
EBPα) consists of three transactivation domains (TAD1,
TAD2 and TAD3) in the amino terminus (N-termal)
and a basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP) at its carboxy
terminus (C-termal) for DNA binding. C/EBPα is a
bZIP transcription factor, which plays a critical role in
myeloid development [55-57]. The expression of C/
EBPα is tightly regulated during myeloid hematopoiesis.
C/EBPα expresses at low level in the HSC and terminal
differentiation stage, but high at the transition stage:

complex, which subsequently phosphorylates IκBα for ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, enabling phosphorylation and transient nuclear
translocation of p65/p50 NF-κB heterodimer. Non canonical pathway depends on NF-κB inducing kinase [126] and IKKα complex to
achieve phosphorylation–induced p100 processing, leading to RelB/p52 complex.

biochemical experiments revealed the underlying
mechanism of NF-κB activation in which FLT3 kinase
physically bound and phosphorylates IKK2, an upstream
regulator of canonical NF-κB pathway [83]. In addition,
Internal tandem duplications of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), one of
the most common genetic abnormalities in AML [84, 85],
induced expression of RelB and p52/NF-B heterodimers,
thus promoting non-canonical NF-κB pathway [86]. In
summary, activation of both canonical and non-canonical
NF-κB pathways appears to be an important event
contributing to the leukemic transformation initiated by
some crucial oncogenic kinases.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a type II
transmembrane protein and the soluble form of TNF-α
is secreted by immune systems including macrophages,
monocytes, neutrophils, T-cells, nature killer (NK)-cells
in response to inflammatory stimulation [75, 76]. TNF
binds two TNF receptors (TNFR1 and 2) and activates the
canonical NFκB pathway [16]. In an AML mouse model,
leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) or leukemia stem cells
(LSCs) exhibit autocrine TNF-α secretion, which causes
constitutive activation of NFκB activity in this unique cell
population [77]. This finding is further supported by the
positive correlation between NF-κB activity and autocrine
TNF-α in human AML samples [77].

NF-κB as a target for anti-AML therapy
Because a large body of evidence supports the
important role of NFκB as a “hallmark of cancer”, there
has been tremendous focus on the development of NFκB
inhibitors for cancer treatment in both the academic
community and the pharmaceutical industry [87-89].
Different NFκB inhibitors have been classified into
8 groups according to their chemical nature and have
been reviewed in details [90-92]. Here, we focus on the
proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib (Velcade®, Millennium
Pharmaceuticals) and other promising NFκB inhibitors in
clinical trials for treatment of AML.
Bortezomib is the first-in-class proteasome
inhibitor, which has been approved by FDA (USA) to
treat multiple myeloma and now relapsed mantle cell
lymphoma too [93-95]. Although the models of action by
proteasome inhibition are not fully elucidated, one of the
important mechanisms associated with the anti-myeloma
functions of Bortezomib is its ability to suppress the NFκB signaling pathway [96]. IκB, a cellular inhibitory
protein of NFκB, is targeted by ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway for degradation when it is phosphorylated at
serine residue 32 and 36. Inhibition of the proteasome
pathway by Bortezomib has been shown to block the
degradation of IκBα, thus sequestering NFκB in the
cytoplasm and preventing NFκB nuclear translocation
and activation of NFκB target genes [97-99]. Because of
its ability to inhibit NFκB activity, it provides a rationale
to examine the effectiveness of Bortezomib either used
alone or in combination with other drugs against AML in
various clinical trials. Early phase I trial in AML evaluated
Bortezomib as monotherapy in refractory or relapsed acute
leukemias. As a monotherapy, the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) of Bortezomib was 1.25 mg/m2, and was
shown to have transient hematological improvements in
some patients [100]. In the subsequent trials in AML,
Bortezomib was further investigated in combination with
other agents. Eight clinical trials that enrolled majority
of patients with AML aimed to evaluate the benefit of
combination of Bortezomib with other drugs (Table 1)
[101-108]. Two trials that combined the use of Bortezomib
with Cytarabine and Anthracyclines (Idarubicin or

Oncogenic kinase activation
RAS protein family includes H-RAS, N-RAS and
K-RAS, which are small GTPase proteins [78]. RAS
proteins transmit signals from extracellular growth factors
by cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active
GTP-bound states. N-RAS or K-RAS mutations occur
in approximate 20% of AML cases [79, 80]. However,
aberrant RAS signaling has been detected in 40% of cases
in addition to RAS mutation, primarily due to is somatic
mutations in the other receptor tyrosine kinase like FLT3
and c-Kit [79, 80].
Birkenkamp and co-workers observed a significant
association between constitutive NFκB DNA-binding
activity and persistent RAS signaling in AML blasts [81].
In ex vivo experiments, AML blasts with high NFκB
DNA-binding activity underwent less or no spontaneous
apoptosis, compared to AML cases with no or low nuclear
NFκB expression. By using small molecular inhibitor
Ly294002 targeting PI3K/AKT pathway, L-744832
targeting RAS, PD98059 targeting ERK/MAPK signaling
and AG1296 targeting FLT3, the authors found that NFκB DNA-binding activity was inhibited only by RAS and
PI3K/AKT inhibitors, thus concluded that increased NFκB activity was regulated by RAS signaling, but not ERK
and FLT3 pathways [81]. In contrast, several other studies
clearly demonstrated that either FLT3 overexpression or
FLT3 mutation increased NFκB activity in AML [82, 83].
Takahashi and colleagues showed that overexpression of
FLT3 in BaF3 cells activated NFB reporter and increase
level of IL-6, a NFκB target gene [82]. They also showed a
modest positive correlation between FLT3 and IL-6 mRNA
expression in AML samples [82]. Similarly, GrosjeanRaillard et al. reported that constitutive activation of FLT3
signaling resulted in activation of NF-κB, while inhibition
of FLT3 signaling either by small molecule inhibitor or
knockdown of Flt3 with RNAi reduced NF-κB activity
and induced apoptosis in AML cell lines and CD34+
primary AML cells [83]. Furthermore, comprehensive

61% and 65%, respectively, and a good safety profile [101,
102]. One study of Bortezomib with Idarubicin in high
risk of AML patients achieved a CR rate of 20% [106].
The other five trials that co-administrated Bortezomib
with other targeted drugs or epigenetic drugs did not
produced encouraging CR rate. But, one important note
should be taken into consideration is that the subjects in
these trials were high-risk patients with either refractory
or relapsed AML or older than 60 years. These may be
confounding factors that adversely impact on the clinical
benefits of these combination therapies. In general, if
these combination regimes are well tolerated, they should
be further evaluated in standard risk patients. When new
generation of inhibitors are developed, they might be
tested in the combination regimes too.

CONCLUSIONS
Over the last decade, our understanding of
NFκB signaling and our ability to target it has evolved
significantly. Although there are now 8 different classes
of more than 700 NFκB inhibitors, only a few of them
have advanced into clinical trials for treatment of AML.
At the same time, a growing body of evidence suggests the
existence of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in AML leading
to the potential relapse of disease and treatment failure
[109-111]. LSCs reside mostly in a quiescent cell cycle
state, which is similar to their counterparts, the normal
hematopoietic stem cells [112-114], thus escaping from
the effects of standard chemotherapy drugs which usually
target proliferative cells. NF-κB activity is aberrantly
increased in primitive human leukemia cells compared
to normal primitive bone marrow cells [47, 77, 115,
116], thus it provides a novel concept to treat AML by
targeting the difference between HSCs and LSCs as
exemplified by the different NF-κB activity between
them. [117-120]. In fact, the small molecule NF-κB
inhibitor dimethylaminoparthenolide (DMAPT /LC1)
has been shown to selectively eradicate AML LSCs in the
laboratory [92, 121-123] and is currently evaluated in a
phase I-II ‘first in man’ clinical study at Cardiff University,
UK (http://medicine.cf.ac.uk/person/dr-steven-knapper/
research/). Hopefully, the result of this much anticipated
trial will demonstrate effectiveness of NF-κB inhibitor in
AML patients.
