ABSTRACT
The 2014 year ended with celebration: Everolimus, a rapamycin analog, was
shown to improve immunity in old humans, heralding ‘a turning point’ in research
and new era in human quest for immortality. Yet, this turning point was predicted a
decade ago. But what will cause human death, when aging will be abolished?

“Defining ageing as a disease and then trying to cure
it is unscientific and misguided.” [1]

INTRODUCTION

RAPAMYCIN YESTERDAY

Until recently, aging was believed to be a functional
decline caused by accumulation of random molecular
damage, which cannot be prevented.
Breaking this dogma, hyperfunction theory
described aging as a continuation of growth, driven by
signaling pathways such as TOR (Target of Rapamycin).
TOR-centric model predicts that rapamycin (and other
rapalogs) can be used in humans to treat aging and prevent
diseases [2]. In proper doses and schedules, rapamycin and
other rapalogs not only can but also must extend healthy
life-span in humans [2, 3].
This theory was ridiculed by opponents and
anonymous peer-reviewers. Yet, it was predicted in 2008
that “five years from now, current opponents will take the
TOR-centric model for granted” [4]. And this prediction
has been fulfilled.

In 2006, it was concluded that “ Sirolimus or
Rapamune, which is known in the basic science as
rapamycin, is already approved for clinical use, available
and can be used immediately. In addition to cancer,
cardiovascular diseases, autoimmunity, and metabolic
disorders, all diseases of aging from osteoporosis to
Alzheimer’s may be treated with rapamycin. Finally,
rapamycin will be most useful as an anti-aging drug to
slow down senescence and to prevent diseases.” [2]
And further, “Rapamycin is safe enough to be
administrated daily to transplant patients for several years.
Actually, rapamycin is so safe that its pharmacokinetics
have been studied in healthy volunteers”. “Figuratively,
it [rapamycin] transforms immunity from aged-type to
infant-type”. In simple words, rapamycin rejuvenates the
immunity. Thus, “rapamycin eliminates hyper-immunity
rather than suppresses immunity” [2].
“Anti-aging drug today” [3] was actually published
yesterday: “Rapamycin is a non-toxic, well-tolerated
drug that is suitable for everyday oral administration.
Preclinical and clinical data indicate that rapamycin is
a promising drug for age-related diseases and seems to
have anti-tumor, bone-sparing and calorie-restrictionmimicking ‘side-effects’.” [3]. As recently reviewed,
in proper doses, lifespan-extending agents including
rapamycin posses certain immunostimulatory activities
[6].

RAPAMYCIN TODAY
The study that Evirolimus (RAD001), a rapamycin
analog, improves immunity in aging humans [5] made
sensational headlines:
“Novartis Working on ‘Fountain of Youth’ Drug”.
“Researchers could be closing in on a “fountain of youth”
drug that can delay the effects of aging and improve the
health of older adults”.
As summarized by Nir Barzilai, “it sets the stage
for using this drug to target aging, to improve everything

By 2010, many predictions of the TOR-centric
model have been tested and confirmed [7]. In 2010,
one prediction remained: “rapamycin will become the
cornerstone of anti-aging therapy in our life time.” [7].
Until December 2014, all gerontological papers on
rapamycin stated that current rapalogs are just proof of
principle and will not be used due to side effects. Even
further, use of anti-aging drugs in our lifetime was called
science fiction. For unclear reasons, scientists emphasized
that rapamacin and other current rapalogs will not be used
in aging humans due to imaginary side effects.

growth. It is a quasi -program (not a program), a shadow
of development. More on that was discussed previously
[16, 21-27].

THREE SOURCES FOR THE TORCENTRIC MODEL
1. Genetics of longevity
The work in model organisms revealed numerous
genes whose inactivation extends life span [3, 28-57].
Some gerogenes encode the TOR pathway. Yet, is the TOR
pathway central or just one of the numerous pathways?
Independent work on cellular senescence answers this
question.

TRIUMPH OF MTOR-CENTRIC MODEL
The hyperfunctional theory predicts calorierestriction-mimicking ‘side-effects’ of rapalogs. For
example, rapamycin increases lipolysis, thus imitating
fasting [3]. And in some conditions, rapamycin may cause
“starvation diabetes”, a benevolent insulin-resistance and
glucose intolerance. “Starvation or Hunger Diabetes”
was well known during famine and prolonged fasting
[8]. Rapamycin, as calorie-restriction-mimetic, can
cause starvation-like symptoms in certain conditions.
This benevolent rapamycin-induced state prevents
complications of true type II diabetes [9, 10]. In certain
strains of mice, rapamycin causes some symptoms of
starvation-like insulin-resistance, erroneously viewed
as real diabetes [11]. These metabolic alterations are
reversible [12, 13]. MTOR-centric model predicts that
this reversible insulin resistance is benevolent and is
associated with increased longevity because longevity is
promoted not via increased insulin sensitivity, but instead
via decreased mTOR pathway signaling [9].
Initially, mTOR-centic model was ignored. As
announced by Lamming et al, “A growing list of side
effects make it doubtful that rapamycin would ultimately
be beneficial in humans.” [14] Now however the same
opponent re-invented mTOR-centric model (without
appropriate reference), suggesting that “longevity is
promoted not via increased insulin sensitivity, but instead
via decreased PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway signaling” [15].
As it was predicted in 2008 [4], opponents indeed take
mTOR-centric model for granted. This is the ultimate
triumph of the TOR-centric (hyperfunction) theory of
aging.

2. Cellular senescence
In 2003 it was proposed that activation of growthpromoting pathways should cause senescence, when
the cell cycle is blocked [58]. In fact, mTOR converts
reversible cell cycle arrest to cellular senescence
(geroconversion) [59-61]. Rapamycin partially suppresses
geroconversion [62-76]. All gerogenic pathways converge
on the mTOR pathway: upstream and downstream [7783]. Typically, oncogenes are gerogenes, whereas tumor
suppressors are gerosuppressors [59, 84-87]. Gerogenes
and gerosuppressors constitute the mTOR network. This
network is identical to gerogenic pathways identified in
model organisms [3].
3. Diseases
Completely independently, mTOR pathway was
revealed in the studies of human diseases: Parkinson and
Alzheimer, cancer and benign tumors, cardiac fibrosis
and atherosclerosis, renal hypertrophy and diabetic
complications [19, 88-97]. And while gerontologists
thought that rapamycin causes cancer, numerous studies
by nephrologists and transplantologists showed that
rapamycin prevents cancer in humans [86, 98-103]. Most
studies were performed by scientists, working in narrow
clinical fields [104-106]. Only taken together, these studies
illuminate the role of mTOR in all age-related diseases.
These age-related diseases are direct causes of death in
aging. No one dies from aging per se.
Michael Hall, who discovered TOR and named it
after rapamycin [107], remarkably envisioned in 2005
that “inhibitors of mammalian TOR may be useful in the
treatment of cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmunity,
and metabolic disorders” [93]. This generalization,
combined with discoveries in model organisms and
cellular senescence, was taken a step further [2]. mTORdriven hyperfubnction leads to alterations of homeostasis,
diseases and death. Examples of systemic hyperfuctions
include hypertension, hyper-insulinemia and organ
hypertrophy.

TOR-CENTRIC MODEL
Evolutionary theory predicts that growth-promoting
pathways are antagonistically pleiotropic [16]. In
other words, growth-promoting signaling is essential
during development and may be harmful later in life. In
particular, the nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway is essential
for growth and development. In adults, its excessive
activity leads to pathology (aging) [17-20]. Aging is
an unintended, harmful continuation of developmental

HOW WILL PEOPLE DIE, WHEN AGING
WILL BE ABOLISHED: POST-AGING
SYNDROME

hyperfunction theory of aging has been compared to
the replacement of the geocentric with the heliocentric
worldview. Within this rather grand conceptual
framework, I may be seen as an old-timer who desperately
tries to salvage a doomed theory by piling up epicycles.
Perhaps so – time will tell.” [126].
Time told unexpectedly fast. While gerontologists
were studying free radicals and anti-oxidants, the TORcentric (hyperfunction) theory revealed anti-aging drugs
such as rapamycin and metformin. There are several
potential anti-aging drugs in clinical use [127, 128].
Combining drugs and modalities, selecting doses and
schedules in clinical trial will ensure the maximal lifespan
extension [27, 129].
Simultaneously, medical progress improves agingtolerance [129, 130]. Aging tolerance is the ability to
survive despite aging [130]. For example, bypass surgery
allows patients with coronary disease to live, despite
aging-associated atherosclerosis.
Gerontologists do not need to catch the train that
has already departed. No need to study rapamycin, which
already entered the clinic. This is now a merely medical
task. Gerontologists may continue to study free radicals
and accumulation of random molecular damage as a
potential cause of post-aging syndrome (not aging). It is
important to study post-aging syndrome, to be ready to
fight it, when medical progress with rapamycin will allow
us to reach post-aging age: perhaps 50 years from now.

Currently, humans and animals (in protected
environment) die from age-related diseases, which are
manifestation of aging. By slowing aging, rapamycin and
calorie restriction can delay age-related diseases including
cancer [108-125]. They extend life span. Yet, the causes of
death seem to be the same. Or not? Why is this important?
Consider an analogy. 300 years ago in London, 75%
of people died from external causes (infections, trauma,
starvation) before they reached the age of 26. [22]. So
only a few died from mTOR-driven aging. Only when
most external causes have been eliminated, people now
die from mTOR-driven age-related diseases. Similarly,
if TOR-driven aging would be eliminated by a rational
combination of anti-aging drugs, even then we still would
not be immortal. There will be new, currently unknown
causes of death. I call this post-aging syndrome. We do
not know what it is. But we know that accumulation of
molecular damage or telomere shortening (as examples)
eventually would cause post-aging syndrome [2].

WHY DO WE NOT
SYMPTOMS
OF
SYNDROME?

RECOGNIZE
POST-AGING

Even in the ancient world, when most people died
from “external causes”, symptoms of mTOR-driven aging
were well known. In contrast, we do not know symptoms
of post-aging syndrome. Aging is quasi-programmed
and is not accidental. Although its rate varies among
individuals, the chances to outlive aging and to die from
post-aging syndrome are very low. Still, we may identify
these symptoms in humans over 110 years old and
especially in animals treated with rapamycin (and other
anti-aging modalities). Inhibition of mTOR may extend
life span, thus revealing post-aging syndrome.
How will we know that we observe post-aging
syndrome? There are potential criteria: Animals and
humans die from either unknown diseases, unusual
variants of known-disease and rare diseases. Or at least,
the range of age-related diseases is dramatically changed.
As discussed in 2006, causes of post-aging
syndrome may include accumulation of random molecular
damage, telomere shortening, selfish mitochondria and so
on. As also discussed, when people die from post-aging
syndrome, then anti-oxidants may help, in theory of course
[2].
