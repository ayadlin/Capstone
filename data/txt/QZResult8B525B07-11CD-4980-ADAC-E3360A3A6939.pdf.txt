BACKGROUND. The objective of the current study was to assess the staging accuracy and prognostic role of preoperative endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and computed tomography (CT) in patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC)
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

METHODS. Presurgical LAGC patients underwent EUS and CT before and after 3
cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was comprised of docetaxel
(at a dose of 36 mg/m2) and cisplatin (at a dose of 40 mg/m2) on Days 1 and 8
of a 3-week cycle.

RESULTS. Forty patients were enrolled in the study. After chemotherapy, the accuracy of EUS and CT was found to be 47% and 57%, respectively for T classification (P 5 .22) and 39% and 37%, respectively for N classification (P > .99). The
3-year overall survival (OS) rate for patients downstaged with EUS for T and/or
N classification was greater than that for nondownstaged patients (69% vs 41%;
P 5 .05). The 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was also better for the
EUS-downstaged patients than for the nondownstaged patients (77% vs 47%;
P 5 .04). On multivariate analysis, EUS downstaging was found to be correlated
with OS (hazards ratio [HR] of 0.12; P 5 .04), and was correlated with RFS with
borderline statistical significance (HR of 0.27; P 5 .07). The differences in OS and
RFS between the patients downstaged with CT and those not downstaged were
not found to be statistically significant.

CONCLUSIONS. Restaging by EUS and CT after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
patients with LAGC was found to be inaccurate. However, T and/or N downstaging by EUS was found to be correlated with better OS and RFS. Thus, downstaging by EUS may be a useful clinical parameter with which to predict a better
outcome for LAGC patients. Cancer 2008;112:2368–76.  2008 American Cancer

astric cancer is the second most common cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide1 and the most common cancer in
Korea.2 The only potentially curative treatment for locally advanced
gastric cancer (LAGC) is surgery, which is feasible in <50% of
patients.3,4 The prognosis of patients with LAGC is not good because
of poor curative resectability and a high recurrence rate.4–7 One
approach to these problems is to administer systemic chemotherapy
preoperatively, and recent phase 2 and 3 trials have demonstrated
the efficacy and safety of this approach.8–11 However, accurate pre-

treatment staging is essential to select this strategy
and to evaluate its efficacy.
At the current time, endoscopic ultrasound
(EUS) and computed tomography (CT) are used for
preoperative staging.12 The overall preoperative accuracy of EUS is 78% to 92% for T classification and
63% to 78% for N classification.13–19 For dynamic single-slice helical CT, the preoperative accuracy is 69%
to 82% for T classification and 51% to 71% for N
classification.20–23 Recent advances in CT technology,
including the introduction of multidetector row CT,
have led to slightly improved staging accuracy, with
T classification rates of 77% to 89% and N classification rates of 59% to 78%.17,24–26 Although the use of
EUS and CT as preoperative staging modalities in the
setting of surgery alone has been relatively well studied, to our knowledge their accuracy and clinical
implications after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is uncertain. In other cancers, EUS staging after chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is only 27% to 60% for
T classification and 49% to 60% for N classification
in esophageal cancer, and 48% and 77%, respectively,
in rectal cancer.27–30 Two small trials with gastric
cancer patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy also reported poor concordance between
preoperative EUS staging and surgical pathology
reports.10,31
The prognostic factors for survival after neoadjuvant therapy (R0 resection, pathologic stage, and pathologic response) are determined after surgery32–36
and cannot be used to assess the effectiveness of
neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. Therefore, the
objectives of this prospective study were to 1) assess
the accuracy of preoperative EUS and CT in locoregional staging in patients with LAGC undergoing
surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 2)
assess the impact of downstaging by each modality
on clinical outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
This study recruited patients who, between January
2003 and November 2005, entered the neoadjuvant
arm of a prospective, randomized, phase 2 study
comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with adjuvant
chemotherapy in patients with LAGC. Patients who
had biopsy-confirmed LAGC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
0 to 1 and who underwent EUS and CT before and
after 3 cycles of chemotherapy were included. LAGC
was defined as stage IIIA, IIIB, or IV (M0) disease,
based on CT according to the Japanese Classification
of Gastric Carcinoma by the Japanese Gastric Cancer

2369

Association.37 Patients who were found to have metastatic disease on postchemotherapy CT scan and did
not undergo laparotomy were excluded. Our Institutional Review Board approved the protocol, and all
patients provided written informed consent.

Treatment
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 3 cycles of
intravenous docetaxel (at a dose of 36 mg/m2) and
cisplatin (at a dose of 40 mg/m2) on Days 1 and 8 of
a 3-week cycle. The surgery was performed within 6
weeks of the start of the third cycle. The extent of
lymph node dissection was D2 according to the site
of the primary lesion, but D3 resection was performed if the preoperative CT scan showed equivocal
or definitely enlarged lymph nodes within the N3
area.
Endoscopic Ultrasound
One of 2 experienced endoscopists (I.J.C. and C.G.K.)
performed EUS 3 weeks before neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered and again 3 weeks
before surgery using an Olympus GF-UM200 echoendoscope (Olympus Optical Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) in
patients under conscious sedation induced by parenteral midazolam (at a dose of 3–5 mg). The images
were obtained with scanning frequencies of 7.5
megahertz (mHz) and 12 mHz to allow optimal
visualization of cancer infiltration and local lymph
nodes. Endosonographic features suggesting a malignant lymph node were hypoechoic structure, a sharply demarcated border, round contour, and size >10
mm.38 We used the sixth edition of the International
Union Against Cancer (UICC)/American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM classification system
to determine tumor staging.39
Computed Tomography
CT scan was performed 3 weeks before neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and again 3 weeks before surgery,
according to the gastric cancer CT protocol. We used
a 4-channel multidetector CT (MX-8000; Philips
Medical Systems, Highland Heights, Ohio) and the
following parameters: 120-kilovolt peak, 250 milliampere-seconds, 3.2-mm beam collimation, 1.625 pitch,
5-mm slice thickness, and the patient in the prone
position with the stomach fully distended with water
(a negative contrast medium) 65 seconds after contrast medium injection (Ultravist; Schering, Berlin,
Germany) at a rate of 3 mL/second and again in the
right decubitus position 3 minutes after contrast
medium injection. We also obtained, and simultaneously interpreted, coronal reformatted images of
the prone position.

We considered the lymph nodes as positive if the
longest dimension was >1.0 cm or if it was 0.7 to 1.0
cm and demonstrated strong enhancement, a round
shape, central necrosis, or perinodal infiltration, all
of which are suggestive of metastasis.40 A specialist
in gastric cancer imaging (J.S.L.) interpreted all CT
images while blinded to the endoscopic findings.

Pathology
We determined the postoperative pathologic stage
using the sixth edition of the UICC/AJCC classification system.39 An expert on gastric lesions (M.C.K.)
performed the pathologic examinations.
Statistical Analysis
We considered the T and N staging accuracy of EUS
and CT after neoadjuvant chemotherapy to be the
primary outcomes. We calculated the overall accuracy of tumor staging using EUS and CT and compared it with the following reference standards: for T
classification, the pathologic assessment of the gastrectomy specimens or the intraoperative findings if
the tumor was nonresectable; and for N classification, the pathologic assessment of the lymph nodes
removed on lymphadenectomy. We used the McNemar test to compare the accuracy of EUS and CT T
and N classification.
Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the
time of enrollment to death, whereas recurrence-free
survival (RFS) was calculated as the interval between
enrollment and the documentation of macroscopic
metastatic or recurrent lesions or death. We used the
Kaplan-Meier method to estimate OS and RFS. To
compare patient groups, we used a log-rank test and
the Cox proportional hazards model. We used the
Pearson chi-square test or the Fisher exact test to
compare discrete data. All tests were 2-sided, and we
considered P  .05 to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 44 patients were recruited. One patient was
excluded for synchronous rectal cancer, 1 patient
was excluded for not undergoing EUS after chemotherapy, and 2 patients were excluded for not undergoing laparotomy (because of metastatic disease),
leaving 40 patients (30 of whom were men) for the
analysis. The median age of the patients was 58 years
(range, 36–70 years). The tumor location was the distal stomach in 27 patients (68%), the proximal stomach in 6 patients (15%), and whole stomach in 7
patients (17%). The distribution of clinical stage

chemotherapy on the basis of EUS and CT was as
follows: stage II, 12% versus 0%; stage IIIA, 45% versus 35%; stage IIIB, 27% versus 30%; and stage IV
(M0 disease), 15% versus 35%.

Surgical and Pathologic Staging
Table 1 shows the distribution of T classification after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The results were based
on pathologic examination of gastrectomy specimens
in 38 patients (95%), and on intraoperative findings
in the remaining 2 patients (5%) for whom the disease was found to be unresectable because of peritoneal seeding at the time of surgical exploration.
Lymphadenectomy was performed in 38 patients
(95%), and a D2 or higher extended lymphadenectomy was performed in all patients who underwent
gastrectomy. The median number of dissected lymph
nodes was 31 (range, 16–69 lymph nodes), and the
median number of positive lymph nodes was 5
(range, 0–40 positive lymph nodes). Table 2 shows
the distribution of N classification after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy. The median interval between staging
re-examination and surgery was 6 days for both EUS
(range, 1–23 days) and CT (range, 1–27 days).
T Reclassification after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
Table 1 summarizes the results of T classification by
EUS and CT after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The
greater overall staging accuracy for CT compared
with EUS was not found to be statistically significant
(P 5 .22, McNemar test). Overstaging was more frequent than understaging with both techniques.
The proportion of correct T classifications by
EUS was 0% (0 of 2 patients) for patients with T1

Prognostic Impact of EUS and CT Downstaging
on Survival
With a median follow-up time of 37.7 months (range,
15.1–50.2 months), the median OS for the 40 patients
in the current study was 40.1 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI] not reached). Compared with
prechemotherapy EUS, postchemotherapy EUS downstaged T and/or N classification (T classification only
in 4 patients, N classification only in 14 patients, and
both T and N classification in 2 patients) in 20
patients (50%) and did not affect either classification
in the other 20 patients. The 2 groups (patients who
were downstaged and those not downstaged) did not
significantly differ with regard to median age, tumor
location, Lauren classification, or pretreatment EUS
T classification, N classification, or TNM stage, but
the downstaged group had a higher proportion of
male patients (85% vs 55%; P 5 .03 by the Pearson
chi-square test) and a higher proportion of patients
with an ECOG performance status of 0 (35% vs 0%;
P 5 .008 by the Fisher exact test). The median OS of
nondownstaged patients was 34.7 months (95% CI,
10.5–58.9 months), whereas the median OS of the
downstaged patients had not yet been reached at the
time of last follow-up (P 5 .05). The corresponding 3year survival rates were 41% and 69% (Fig. 1A).

Compared with prechemotherapy CT, postchemotherapy CT downstaged T and/or N classification
(T classification only in 5 patients, N classification
only in 14 patients, both T and N classification in 7
patients) in 26 patients (65%), and did not affect
stage in the other 14 patients (35%). The 2 groups
did not differ significantly with regard to sex ratio,
ECOG performance status, tumor location, Lauren
classification, pretreatment CT T classification, or
TNM stage, but the downstaged group had a higher
median age (62 years vs 49 years; P 5 .003) and a
higher proportion of N2 or N3 disease detected on
pretreatment CT (61% vs 21%; P 5 .04 by the Pearson
chi-square test). The median OS of the nondownstaged patients was 30.7 months (95% CI, 14.5–46.9
months), whereas the median OS of the downstaged
patients had not yet been reached at the time of last
follow-up (P 5 .20). The corresponding 3-year survival rates were 37% and 64%, respectively (Fig. 1B).
Univariate Cox regression analyses revealed that
R0 resection (hazards ratio [HR] of 0.11; P 5 .001),
ypT3 or T4 (HR of 3.87; P 5 .03), ypN2 or T3 (HR of
32.10; P 5 .001), tumor location of the entire stomach
(HR of 8.54; P < .001), female sex (HR of 11.78; P <
.001), and postchemotherapy EUS N2 or N3 (HR of
4.97; P 5 .03), as well as tumor downstaging by EUS
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR of 0.44;
P 5 .05), were statistically significant factors influencing OS. Multivariate analysis that included the
above factors revealed that tumor downstaging by
EUS (HR of 0.12; P 5 .04), R0 resection (HR of 0.01;

EUS/CT After Neoadjuvant Therapy in AGC/Park et al.

P 5 .003), ypN2 or N3 (HR of 59.47; P 5 .01), tumor
location of the entire stomach (HR of 9.86; P 5 .01),
and female sex (HR of 10.20; P 5 .01) remained statistically significantly correlated with OS (Table 4).
At the time of last follow-up, the median RFS
had not yet been reached for the R0-resected
patients. The median RFS was found to be significantly better for patients whose T and/or N classifications were downstaged by EUS compared with
nondownstaged patients. The median RFS of nondownstaged patients was only 14.5 months, whereas
the median RFS for downstaged patients had not
been reached at the time of last follow-up (P 5 .04)
(Fig. 2A).
Using CT assessment, the median RFS, similar to
the OS, was not found to be significantly different
between downstaged and nondownstaged patients;
the median RFS of nondownstaged patients was only
13.6 months, whereas the median RFS had not been
reached for downstaged patients at the time of last
follow-up (P 5 .24) (Fig. 2B).
Univariate Cox regression analyses revealed that
ypT3 or T4 (HR of 4.45; P 5 .02), ypN2 or N3 (HR of
12.41; P 5 .001), tumor location of the entire stomach
(HR of 6.38; P 5 .001), female sex (HR of 7.36;
P 5 .001), and postchemotherapy EUS N2 or N3 (HR
of 4.38; P 5 .01), as well as tumor downstaging by
EUS after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR of 0.31;
P 5 .05), were statistically significant factors influencing RFS. Multivariate analysis including the above
factors demonstrated that only ypN2 or N3 (HR of
9.81; P 5 .01) remained significantly correlated with
OS, and EUS tumor downstaging had borderline statistical significance (HR of 0.27; P 5 .07) (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
In this study of 40 patients with LAGC who had
received presurgical neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we
demonstrated that restaging with EUS or CT was neither accurate nor reliable, but that EUS downstaging
was a predictor of OS and RFS. Although limited by
a small number of patients, to our knowledge the
current study is the first to evaluate the accuracy of
EUS and CT restaging in patients with LAGC after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and to examine the role
of EUS and CT in predicting long-term survival.
The current study results demonstrating EUS
restaging inaccuracy after neoadjuvant therapy in
patients with LAGC are consistent with findings after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in
patients with esophageal and rectal cancers. The
accuracy of T and N staging is only 27% to 60% and
49% to 60%, respectively, in esophageal cancer and

apy (n 5 35 patients). (B) Recurrence-free survival according to computed

chemotherapy (n 5 35 patients).

48% and 77%, respectively, in rectal cancer,27–30
whereas it was found to be 47% and 39%, respectively, in the current study.
The tendency of EUS and CT to overstage
tumors in the postchemotherapy setting may stem
from the difficulty in identifying gastric wall layers.
Chemotherapy-induced fibrosis and edema can distort the layers of the stomach wall, leading to errors
in overstaging. In the current study, EUS and CT
overstaged the majority of pathologic T1 and T2
tumors (Table 1), whereas their accuracy in T3
tumors was excellent (94%).
For N classification, the accuracy of EUS (39%)
and CT (37%) was found to be similar. The main

inaccuracy was in understaging, with a rate of 55%
for EUS and 50% for CT. A precise lymph node
count, which is essential for staging according to the
UICC/AJCC TNM classification, is difficult to obtain
on imaging. The inclusion of a high proportion of
patients with pathologic N2 (21%) and N3 (24%)
tumors, in whom the accuracy was only 25% and
0%, respectively, for both techniques, might explain
the low accuracy rates noted in the current study. In
addition, the previous size criteria for metastatic
lymph nodes (1 cm) may not be appropriate. Kim
et al. reported that the average dimension of metastatic lymph nodes (n 5 286) was 10.6  7.6 mm in
their pathologically confirmed series of patients without neoadjuvant treatment.40 In their study, the average metastatic cell cluster in the lymph nodes
measured 6.0  5.7 mm in length, and 38% of the
clusters measured <5 mm. Microscopic invasion of
normal-sized lymph nodes might occur more frequently after neoadjuvant chemotherapy than after
surgery alone, contributing to the understaging. In
addition, the extent of lymphadenectomy may affect
the accuracy of imaging methods. In the current
study, all patients who underwent gastrectomy
received at least a D2 lymphadenectomy. The median
number of dissected lymph nodes per patient was 31
(range, 16–69 lymph nodes). Such extensive lymphadenectomy may result in the better identification of
lymph node metastases41,42 and consequently in high
EUS and CT understaging rates.
Our finding that R0 resection and pathologic N
classification were prognostic factors for OS and RFS

is in agreement with several recent studies that
evaluated neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.32–36 Those factors are determined pathologically after surgery, however, and we are in need
of a clinical parameter that evaluates the efficacy of
treatment before surgery. According to World Health
Organization (WHO) criteria43 and the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),44 the
response to chemotherapy of unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer is assessed by the measurement
of 2 dimensions or 1 dimension of the tumor on
radiographic images. Because neither WHO nor
RECIST considers primary gastric tumor lesions to
be ‘‘measurable,’’ they cannot be assessed by those
criteria. In addition, many patients with localized
gastric cancer have small, measurable tumors in regional lymph nodes and therefore assessing response
on the basis of a size change on CT scan may not
be prognostic in the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
In the current study, the CT-assessed tumor
response, according to WHO criteria, was not associated with OS or RFS (Tables 4 and 5). Conversely,
EUS-assessed downstaging was. Although the restaging accuracy of both EUS and CT after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy was found to be low, and EUS-determined and CT-determined T and N classifications
after chemotherapy did not appear to have prognostic value per se, EUS downstaging of T and/or N classification was found to be a statistically significant
predictor of OS and had borderline significance for
RFS (Tables 4 and 5). Downstaging occurred in

EUS/CT After Neoadjuvant Therapy in AGC/Park et al.

mainly N classification, and the inaccuracy of N
restaging by EUS after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
was mostly attributed to understaging. As a result,
EUS demonstrated a high positive predictive value
(91%) in the detection of lymph node metastases
(Table 3). Downstaging by EUS appeared to reflect
the reduction of tumor burden and may be a useful
clinical parameter with which to predict better survival outcome in patients with LAGC.
Because the use of neoadjuvant therapy in gastric cancer continues to be actively investigated, it is
important to accurately assess its efficacy before surgery. Studies with a larger number of LAGC patents
are needed to clarify the effect of downstaging by
both EUS and CT after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
