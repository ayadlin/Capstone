Abstract
Acquired resistance to TGFb is a key step in the early stages of tumorigenesis. Mutations in TGFb signaling
components are rare, and little is known about the development of resistance in breast cancer. On the other hand,
an activated Notch pathway is known to play a substantial role in promoting breast cancer development. Here, we
present evidence of crosstalk between these two pathways through HEYL. HEYL, a basic helix–loop–helix
transcription factor and a direct target of Notch signaling, is speciﬁcally overexpressed in breast cancer. HEYL
represses TGFb activity by binding to TGFb-activated Smads. HeyL/ mice have defective mammary gland
development with fewer terminal end buds. On the other hand, HeyL transgenic mice show accelerated mammary
gland epithelial proliferation and 24% of multiparous mice develop mammary gland cancer. Therefore, repression
of TGFb signaling by Notch acting through HEYL may promote initiation of breast cancer. Cancer Res; 74(22);

Introduction
TGFb is a multifunctional cytokine that exerts pleiotropic
effects on virtually all known cell types through a seemingly
simple signal transduction pathway. TGFb binds to its transmembrane receptors, which leads to phosphorylation of two
receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), Smad2 and Smad3. The
activated R-Smads then bind to Smad4, forming a Smad
complex that associates with other transcriptional cofactors
to regulate gene expression (1, 2). TGFb is able to suppress
tumor initiation at early stages of cancer development. However, cancer cells usually develop various ways to evade the
growth-inhibitory effect of TGFb. Indeed, loss of TGFb sensitivity is a hallmark of tumor initiation (3). Although mutations

of TGFb signaling components are common in gastrointestinal
cancers (4), such mutations are rarely found in breast cancer.
How breast cancer cells acquire resistance to TGFb-mediated
growth inhibition is largely unknown.
In contrast with the TGFb pathway, activation of the Notch
pathway has been frequently shown to promote breast cancer
development (5). Upon binding of Notch ligand to its receptor,
the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor is released from
the cell membrane through the action of a g-secretase complex
and translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with
RBP-J to induce the expression of genes that promote cell
growth and inhibit cellular differentiation (6, 7). Given the fact
that these two pathways have opposing effects on cell growth
and mammary gland tumor development, it seems plausible
that activation of the Notch pathway in breast cancer can
counteract the inhibitory effects of TGFb signaling. The Notch
pathway has been reported to either synergize or antagonize
TGFb signaling depending on the cellular context, but the
detailed mechanism of their crosstalk is not well established (8,
9). Moreover, the signiﬁcance of their crosstalk in breast cancer
is not known.
HEYL, HEY1, and HEY2 are the members of the HEY
(hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif) family
(10). All three of these genes and the related HES (hairy
and enhancer of split) family members are basic helix–loop–
helix (bHLH) transcription factors and have been shown to
be the direct targets of the Notch pathway (11–14). Hey2-null
mice die in the early postnatal period and have a variety of
cardiovascular defects, including atrioventricular valve and
ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, and congestive
heart failure (15–17). Hey1- or HeyL-null mice do not show
detectable developmental abnormality, while combined loss
of Hey1 and HeyL causes similar cardiovascular defects (18).

To date, the function of HEYL in breast cancer has not been
studied. Here, we show that HEYL can inhibit TGFb signaling by binding to Smad proteins, thereby rendering the cells
resistant to the effect of TGFb.

Generation and characterization of HeyL knockout and
transgenic mice
HeyL knockout mice were generated as previously described
(18, 19). Exons 2–4 of HeyL were deleted. The mammary glands
of 13-week-old HeyL knockout mice and wild-type littermates
were excised and processed for whole-mount staining, IHC
staining and frozen chunks were embedded in the optimal
cutting temperature (OCT).
To generate HeyL transgenic mice, the full-length murine
HeyL cDNA was inserted into the EcoRI site of MKbpA vector
(provided by Dr. Jeffrey Rosen at Baylor College of Medicine).
The resulting vector was cut using BssHII restriction endonuclease, and the microinjection of the fragment containing
the transgene into single-cell embryos isolated from FVB/N
mice was performed by the Transgenic Mouse Core Facility
at National Cancer Institute. The establishment of founder
mice was conﬁrmed by Southern blotting. The FVB/N
founder mice were then crossed with FVB/N wild type mice
for 4-5 generations. The genotype of HeyL transgenic mice
and the wild type littermates was veriﬁed by PCR using
genomic DNA isolated from mouse tails. The HeyL transgenic mice and the wild type littermates were euthanized at
13 week old, 10 days of pregnancy, 10 days of lactation and
30 days after involution. The inguinal mammary fad pads
were excised and processed for whole mount staining, IHC
staining and frozen chunks embedded in OCT.

HEYL, a Novel Negative Regulator of TGFb in Breast Cancer

3- and 20-fold higher in colon and breast cancer endothelial
cells, respectively, compared with their normal counterparts
(20, 21). To determine HEYL protein expression in cancer, we
raised a polyclonal antibody targeting the peptide sequence
(EPSGSDGESDGPID) at the N-terminus of HEYL that is speciﬁc to HEYL, and performed IHC analysis on breast tumors.
This antibody speciﬁcally recognized HEYL because the staining in breast cancer tissue was blocked by the peptide that was
used as an antigen for generating the HEYL antibody (Supplementary Fig. S1A). In addition, only HS578T breast cancer
cells stably expressing HEYL, but not vector controls, were
positive by immunoﬂuorescent staining (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). We also conﬁrmed that in immunoﬂuorescent analysis,
this antibody showed positive staining with MDA-MB-435HEYL cells, but did not cross-react with HEY1- and HES1transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C). IHC analysis of
breast cancer tissue arrays indicated that, in addition to the
positive staining in tumor endothelial cells, HEYL is also
abundantly expressed in tumor epithelial cells. Compared with
normal breast tissues that showed negative staining (0/13),
signiﬁcantly strong nuclear immunostaining was detected
in 45% (50/111; P ¼ 0.002) of invasive ductal carcinomas
and in 46% (6/13; P ¼ 0.015) of invasive lobular carcinomas
(representative photomicrographs shown in Fig. 1A). qRT-PCR
showed high HEYL mRNA expression (cutoff value: 5.0 U) in
50% (18/36) of primary and in 34.5% (10/29) metastatic breast
cancers but not in normal breast tissue organoids (0/8; Fig. 1B).
We also compared HEYL expression in 62 matched normal and
primary breast tumors (abbreviated as BRCA) in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and found that HEYL expression is signiﬁcantly higher in tumors (P < 0.0001) compared
with normal breast tissue (Fig. 1C).
HEYL is a known direct target of the Notch pathway as
shown by studies in cell culture and mouse models (12, 13, 22).
Taking into account the cell type-speciﬁc action of the Notch
pathway, we tested whether Notch can activate HEYL expression in breast epithelial cells. Expression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (N1IC), which mimics Notch pathway activation upon ligand binding, in the breast cancer cell line HS578T
resulted in increasing levels of HEYL expression (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Cotransfection of the N1IC vector and a HEYL
promoter-driven luciferase vector resulted in a signiﬁcant
increase in luciferase activity (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Knockdown of the expression of RBP-J, a critical mediator of the
canonical Notch pathway, in MDA-MB-231 cells reduced HEYL
expression (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Consistent with our
ﬁndings, it was reported that soluble Notch receptor interfering with the Notch ligand-receptor binding can repress HEYL
expression in MDA-MB-231 cells, and HEYL was the only Notch

target gene that was associated with the expression of the
Notch ligand Jagged1 in breast cancer clinical samples (23).
These data suggest that HEYL may potentially mediate part of
Notch oncogenic activities in breast cancer.
Because very few experimental investigations have been
performed on the functions of HEYL, we performed bioinformatics analysis of multiple public databases to retrieve biochemical and genetic data that might provide heretofore
unknown links of HEYL to key signaling pathways. A
genome-wide mass spectrometry-based immune-precipitation proteomics study indicated that HEYL can bind to Smad3,
a ﬁnding corroborated by a large-scale yeast-2-hybrid study
(24, 25). Taking into account the contradictory growth promoting effects of Notch and growth inhibitory effects of TGFb
signaling in early breast cancer development, we examined the
possibility that HEYL could inhibit the TGFb pathway. Using a
TGFb-responsive reporter vector, p3TP-Luc, as seen before,
TGFb treatment or Smad3 overexpression signiﬁcantly
increased the luciferase activity; however, this transactivation
was strongly inhibited by HEYL (Fig. 2A). We observed a similar
transcription repression when a second TGFb-responsive
reporter vector containing the P15 (CDKN2B) gene promoter
was used in the same assay (Fig. 2B). Consistent with ﬁndings
in the luciferase assays, TGFb treatment of immortalized
human keratinocyte cells, HaCaT, resulted in dynamic upregulation of endogenous mRNA levels of PAI-1 and P15 at
different time points; similarly, this transcriptional induction
was repressed in the presence of HEYL (Fig. 2C). We performed
the same experiment on MCF10A breast cell line and measured
PAI-1 and Smad7 expression, (but not of P15, because both
alleles of this gene are deleted in MCF10A cells). Again, HEYL
repressed the expression of PAI-1 and Smad7 induced by TGFb
(Fig. 2C). As shown in a BrdUrd incorporation assay, MCF-10A
human breast epithelial cells expressing HEYL proliferated
faster compared with control cells upon TGFb treatment
(Fig. 2D).
Next, we studied TGFb responses in breast cancer cells that
were depleted of HEYL. HEYL expression was signiﬁcantly
reduced in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells infected with
retroviral vectors and stably expressing two different HEYL
shRNAs (Fig. 2E). MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells have an
intact TGFb signaling pathway, but growth of these cells, for
unknown reasons, is not inhibited upon TGFb treatment.
Because P15 is not expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells, we
examined alterations of endogenous mRNA expression of
PAI-1 and Smad7 upon TGFb treatment. As expected, TGFb
treatment activated expression of PAI-1 and Smad7 in MDAMB-231 cells, and their expression levels were higher in the
HEYL knockdown cells (Fig. 2F). Collectively, these results

support the notion that HEYL expression renders cells less
sensitive to TGFb.
Direct interaction with Smad3 is one mechanism through
which HEYL might interfere with TGFb signaling as shown by
bioinformatics analysis of databases. Using coimmunoprecipitation assays in Cos1, we detected a strong protein–protein
interaction between HEYL and Smad3; addition of TGFb did
not increase the strength of this interaction (Fig. 3A). To
conﬁrm the interaction between HEYL and Smad3 in vivo, we
performed the bimolecular ﬂuorescence complementation
assay in Cos1 cells. Two fusion proteins, one containing the
N-terminal half of GFP fused with HEYL and the other containing the C-terminal half of GFP fused with Smad3, were coexpressed in Cos1 cells. The emission of green ﬂuorescence in the
nuclei of these cells indicated that the interaction between
HEYL and Smad3 had pulled the two halves of GFP into close
proximity. On the other hand, a HOXB7 fusion protein, used as
a negative control, showed very faint ﬂuorescence when coexpressed with the C-terminal half of GFP–Smad3 fusion protein.
Deleting the basic domain of HEYL, but not the helix–loop–
helix domain, lowered the ﬂuorescence intensity to the levels of
the control, suggesting that the basic domain of HEYL may
mediate its interaction with Smad3 (Fig. 3B and schematic
of HEYL domains). We also detected the interaction of endogenous Smad3 and HEYL in MDA-MB-231 cells by coimmunoﬂuorescent staining and confocal microscopy imaging
(Fig. 3C). Moreover, GST pulldown assays indicated that
their interaction was direct and that deletion of the basic
domain signiﬁcantly decreased the interaction (Supplementary Fig. S3).
To map the domains of HEYL and Smad3 that are involved in
the interaction, immunoprecipitation assays were performed
in Cos1 cells using a series of constructs with various domain
deletions of HEYL and Smad3 (domains of HEYL and Smad3
shown in Fig. 3B). We found that the deletion of the basic
domain of HEYL abolished its interaction with Smad3, whereas
the MH2 domain of Smad3 alone can mediated the interaction.
Therefore, the basic domain of HEYL can interact with the
MH2 domain of Smad3 (Fig. 3D). The MH2 domain is highly
conserved in the Smad protein family. This raises the possibility that HEYL can interact with other Smads as well.
Immunoprecipitation assays showed that HEYL, in fact, did
interact with Smad4. Although HEYL interacted with Smad3
through its basic domain only, HEYL interaction with Smad4
required both the basic and helix–loop–helix domain (Fig. 3E).
In addition, HEYL was able to repress the transactivation of
p3TP-Luc induced by Smad4, suggesting that the binding of
HEYL to Smad4 also resulted in the inhibition of Smad4 activity
(Fig. 3F).
To test whether the interaction between HEYL and Smad3
was necessary and sufﬁcient for the inhibition of TGFb signaling, we used (SBE)4-Luc, another TGFb-responsive reporter
vector consisting of tandem synthetic Smad-binding elements
transfected into HepG2 cells. Unlike other TGFb-responsive
luciferase vectors, (SBE)4-Luc can be activated by Smad3/4
complex in the absence of additional transcriptional cofactors
(26). TGFb treatment or Smad3 overexpression also transactivates its luciferase activity. However, HEYL repressed the

6516

Cancer Res; 74(22) November 15, 2014

transactivation of (SBE)4-Luc induced by either TGFb or
Smad3 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, the direct interaction of HEYL with Smad3 alone seems to be sufﬁcient to inhibit
TGFb signaling. In line with our ﬁnding that the basic and
helix–loop–helix domain of HEYL mediated interaction with
either Smad3 or Smad4, the repressive effect of HEYL on the
TGFb pathway was abrogated when either domain was deleted,
strongly suggesting that the binding of HEYL to Smad proteins
was necessary for HEYL to inhibit the TGFb pathway (Fig. 3G).
Our data indicate a counteractive effect of Notch and
TGFb on breast epithelial cell growth. In fact, in both Notch2
knockout mice and TGFb mammary gland-speciﬁc transgenic mice, the phenotypes of mammary gland development
are remarkably similar, reduced epithelial cell growth and
fewer terminal end buds (27, 28) were observed. If HeyL
dampens TGFb signaling, HeyL knockout mice (18, 18) are
predicted to show mammary gland defects similar to TGFb
transgenic mice. To test this hypothesis, we examined the
mammary glands of virgin wild-type and HeyL knockout
littermates at 13 weeks old. We found that the mammary
glands of HeyL knockout mice have much less side branching
and very few terminal ducts (Fig. 4A and B). The epithelial
cells of HeyL knockout mice show reduced cell proliferation
with signiﬁcantly lower Ki-67–positive stained cells (Fig. 4C
and D). To test the involvement of TGFb in the generation of
this phenotype, we treated HeyL knockout mice with a
speciﬁc TGFb type I receptor inhibitor, SB535334. In
response to the treatment, the mammary gland ducts developed more side branches and terminal ducts (Fig. 4E and F),
suggesting that enhanced TGFb signaling inhibits mammary
gland development in HeyL knockout mice.
To further probe HeyL's function in vivo, we generated
transgenic mice that speciﬁcally express HeyL in the mammary
gland under the control of the MMTV-LTR promoter (Fig. 5A).
HEYL transgenic mice showed robust transgene HeyL expression in mammary glands at different development stages, and
low level of endogenous HeyL expression in mammary glands
in both wild-type littermates and transgenic mice (Fig. 5A).
Although endogenous HeyL expression did not change significantly at different stages of mammary gland development, the
HeyL transgene expression level increased at the pregnancy
and involution stages, consistent with the fact that MMTV-LTR
promoter can be activated by progestins and corticosteroids.
Increased HeyL protein expression level in pregnant transgenic
mice was also conﬁrmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). Comparing mammary gland development between wild-type littermates and HeyL transgenic virgin mice at 13 weeks old, HeyL
transgenic virgin mice showed more mammary gland duct
side-branching in the whole-mount analysis (Fig. 5B and C),
which was also conﬁrmed by histologic examination (Supplementary Fig. S5). Strong ductal cell proliferation in HeyL
transgenic mice was evidenced by increased Ki-67 staining
(Fig. 5E). During pregnancy, wild-type mice developed welldifferentiated secretory epithelium containing lipid ﬁlled
secretory vesicles, whereas HeyL transgenic mice showed
limited epithelial differentiation and very few secreted vesicles
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Thirty days after weaning, the wildtype mouse mammary gland returned back to normal, leaving

mainly simple ductal structures. However, the HeyL transgenic
mice showed delayed and incomplete involution with numerous clusters of cells with disorganized structure, and ductal
structures were poorly deﬁned and highly proliferative (Fig.
5B–E).
We also monitored mammary tumor development in adult
HeyL transgenic mice from at least three different founders.
Frequent mammary gland hyperplasia, not observed in age-and
parity-matched wild-type littermates, was found in multiparous
HeyL transgenic mice (32%, 8/25; Fig. 6A and Supplementary
Fig. S7), and 6 out of 25 (24%) multiparous transgenic mice
(range from 13 months to 20 months) developed mammary
tumors (Fig. 6B, a–c). Wild-type multiparous littermates
showed low frequency of hyperplasia (19%, 4/21), and no tumors
were detected. A low frequency of mammary gland hyperplasia
(8%, 2/25) was also found in virgin transgenic mice. Compared
with the wild-type group, mammary tumor and hyperplasia
incidence was signiﬁcantly higher in HeyL transgenic mice
(Fisher exact test, P ¼ 0.016). Histopathologically, these tumors
were adenocarcinomas or adenosquamous carcinomas, and
adjacent mammary glands showed extensive hyperplasia, suggesting that some hyperplastic regions may evolve into cancers.
High levels of HeyL mRNA and protein expression were detected
in these tumors (Supplementary Fig. S8). In addition, the
expression of PAI-1 and P15, two TGFb target genes, was lower
in HEYLþ transgenic mammary tumors than in normal mammary glands (Supplementary Fig. S9), providing evidence for low
TGFb function in high HEYL-expressing mammary tumors.

Discussion
In this paper, we provide the ﬁrst comprehensive report of
the role of HEYL in breast cancer. We report that HEYL, a direct
target gene of the Notch pathway, is found overexpressed in
breast cancer. HEYL inhibits TGFb signaling through direct
binding to Smads. The basic and helix–loop–helix domains
that mediate HEYL's interaction with Smads are highly con-

www.aacrjournals.org

served among the members of HERP family. In fact, our
unpublished data indicate that HEY1 also binds to Smads.
Thus, the Notch pathway tightly represses TGFb signaling
through the binding of several of its targets to Smad proteins,
indicating a closely interactive, but functionally antagonistic,
network between the two pathways (model in Supplementary
Fig. S10). Consistent with the in vitro data, HeyL knockout mice
have enhanced TGFb signaling and less mammary gland
development. In addition, our in vivo mouse model shows that
HeyL transgenic mice have enhanced cell proliferation during
mammary gland development and develop mammary gland
hyperplasia and mammary tumors. Similar phenotypes are
seen between the abnormal mammary gland development in
type II TGFb receptor knockout mice or transgenic mice
expressing dominant negative type II TGFb receptor (28,
29, 30). Thus, HeyL transgenic mice can recapitulate most of
the phenotypes of mice with reduced TGFb signaling.
The early protection provided by the TGFb pathway plays a
central role in suppressing the formation of most types of
cancers. Previous studies have identiﬁed an oncogene SnoN
that interferes with TGFb signaling in breast cancer in a
manner similar to HEYL. However, HEYL and SnoN are regulated in a dissimilar fashion. SnoN expression is upregulated
by TGFb, whereas HEYL expression is induced by the Notch
pathway (31). Moreover, HEYL is frequently overexpressed in
human breast cancer but not in normal human breast tissues,
whereas SnoN expression is present in normal breast epithelial
cells, but is variable in breast cancer in terms of subcellular
localization and expression level (32).
Extensive reports indicate that the Notch pathway promotes
breast cancer development. However, the interplay between
the Notch and TGFb pathways in breast cancer is unclear. In
this paper, we have provided several lines of evidence to show
that HEYL is a novel negative regulator of the TGFb pathway.
The identiﬁcation of HEYL as a direct target of the Notch
pathway that associates with Smad proteins and inhibits TGFb
signaling provides a new insight into the tumor-promoting
capabilities of the Notch pathway.
