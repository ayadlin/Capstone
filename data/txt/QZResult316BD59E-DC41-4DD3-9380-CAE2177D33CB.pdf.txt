Summary
The C. elegans insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) cascade plays a central role in the regulation of lifespan,
dauer diapause, metabolism and stress response. The major regulatory control of IIS is through
phosphorylation of its components by serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. In a RNAi screen
for serine/threonine protein phosphatases that counter-balance the effect of the kinases in the IIS
pathway, we identified pptr-1, a B56 regulatory subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. Modulation of
pptr-1 affects phenotypes associated with the IIS pathway including lifespan, dauer, stress resistance
and fat storage. We show that PPTR-1 functions by regulating worm AKT-1 phosphorylation at Thr
350. With striking conservation, mammalian B56β regulates Akt phosphorylation at Thr 308 in 3T3L1 adipocytes. In C. elegans, this modulation ultimately leads to changes in subcellular localization
and transcriptional activity of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16. This study reveals a
conserved role for the B56 regulatory subunit in modulating insulin signaling through AKT
dephosphorylation and thereby has widespread implications in cancer and diabetes research.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) pathway is an evolutionarily conserved neuro-endocrine
pathway that regulates metabolism, development, stress resistance and lifespan (Antebi,
2007; Barbieri et al., 2003; Kenyon, 2005; Wolff and Dillin, 2006). In Caenorhabditis
elegans (C. elegans), the insulin-like receptor DAF-2 (Kimura et al., 1997) signals through a
PI 3-kinase (AGE-1/AAP-1) (Morris et al., 1996; Wolkow et al., 2002) signaling cascade that
activates the downstream serine/threonine kinases PDK-1, AKT-1, AKT-2 and SGK-1
(Hertweck et al., 2004; Paradis et al., 1999; Paradis and Ruvkun, 1998). These kinases in turn
function to negatively regulate the forkhead transcription factor (FOXO), DAF-16 (Lin et al.,
1997; Ogg et al., 1997).

Reduction-of-function mutations in serine/threonine kinases upstream of DAF-16 lead to
changes in lifespan, development, metabolism and/or stress resistance (Antebi, 2007; Kenyon,
2005; Wolff and Dillin, 2006). Importantly, loss-of-function mutations in daf-16 completely
suppress these phenotypes (Antebi, 2007; Kenyon, 2005; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006; Wolff
and Dillin, 2006). Thus DAF-16 is a major downstream target of the IIS pathway. Regulation
of DAF-16 by AKT-1, AKT-2 and SGK-1 results in its nuclear exclusion and sequestration in
the cytosol (Lin et al., 2001) (Hertweck et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2001). In contrast, under low
signaling conditions, active DAF-16 enters the nucleus and transactivates or represses its direct
target genes (Henderson and Johnson, 2001; Hertweck et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2001; Lin et al.,
2001; Oh et al., 2006). Strikingly, this negative regulation of FOXO/DAF-16 is conserved
across species. In mammals, the Akt and SGK kinases can phosphorylate and negatively
regulate FOXO (Brunet et al., 1999; Brunet et al., 2001).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although regulation of the IIS pathway by serine/threonine protein kinases has been
extensively studied, little is known about the phosphatases acting in this pathway. In C.
elegans, the lipid phosphatase DAF-18 (homologous to mammalian Phosphatase and Tensin
Homolog, PTEN) is the only phosphatase that has been identified and characterized as a
negative regulator of the IIS pathway (Gil et al., 1999; Mihaylova et al., 1999; Ogg and Ruvkun,
1998; Rouault et al., 1999). The increased lifespan of daf-2 mutant worms is suppressed by
loss-of-function mutation in daf-18 (Dorman et al., 1995; Larsen et al., 1995). Therefore, to
identify additional regulators of the IIS pathway, we performed a directed RNAi screen of
serine/threonine protein phosphatases that affect phenotypes regulated by the IIS pathway.
C. elegans development proceeds from an egg, through 4 larval stages into a self-fertilizing,
hermaphrodite adult. However, under unfavorable growth conditions such as crowding and
low food availability, worms enter a stage of diapause known as dauer (Riddle D., 1997). Upon
favorable growth conditions, dauers are able to form reproductive adults. Since worms form
dauers constitutively when the function of IIS pathway is reduced by mutations, we took
advantage of a temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of daf-2 for the RNAi screen (Riddle et al.,
1981). We screened for genes that suppressed dauer formation in daf-2(e1370) mutants. In this
report, we characterize PPTR-1, a regulatory subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme, as an important
regulator of development, longevity, metabolism and stress response in C. elegans. We show
that PPTR-1 acts by modulating AKT-1 phosphorylation and as a consequence controls
DAF-16 activity.

Results
RNAi screen to identify phosphatases in IIS pathway

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To identify the serine/threonine phosphatases in the C. elegans genome, we performed in
silico analyses using both NCBI KOGs (clusters of euKaryotic Orthologous Groups) and
WormBase (a C. elegans database: http://www.wormbase.org; WS152) annotations. A total
of 60 genes were identified for further analysis (Figure 1A). We obtained RNAi clones for
these phosphatases from the Ahringer RNAi library (Kamath et al., 2003), generated them
using available clones from the ORFeome library (Reboul et al., 2003) or cloned them denovo using Gateway Technology (Invitrogen, USA; Materials and Methods). We were unable
to clone 3 of the phosphatase cDNAs and therefore screened a total of 57 candidates.
In addition, we included 6 of the 7 annotated PP2A holoenzyme regulatory subunits (one was
not cloned) in the screen for two reasons. First, a preliminary chemical inhibitor screen
identified the PP2A family of phosphatases as important regulators of DAF-16 nuclear
translocation (Padmanabhan and Tissenbaum, unpublished data). Second, the PP2A
holoenzyme is comprised of a catalytic, structural and a regulatory subunit (Janssens et al.,

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 March 6.

2008) and RNAi of the catalytic and structural subunits of PP2A resulted in lethality (data not
shown).

daf-2(e1370) carries a mutation in the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domain that results in a
ts phenotype for dauer formation (Kimura et al., 1997). daf-2(e1370) worms arrest as 100%
dauers at 25°C whereas at 15°C they have a normal reproductive cycle (Riddle D., 1997). At
an intermediate temperature of 20 °C, a significant percentage of daf-2(e1370) worms form
dauers. Therefore, at this temperature, one can use RNAi to easily assess the contribution of
any gene in modulating daf-2 dauer formation.
For the screen, daf-2(e1370) mutants were grown on RNAi-expressing bacteria for two
generations, and eggs were picked onto 3 plates for each RNAi clone (Figure 1B). The plates
were incubated at 20°C and scored 3.5-4 days later for the presence of dauers and non-dauers.
Since DAF-18 is the only known phosphatase that negatively regulates the IIS in C. elegans,
we used daf-18 RNAi as a positive control in all our experiments. From a total of 63 RNAi
clones (57 phosphatases and 6 regulatory subunits), we identified two phosphatases that
dramatically decreased daf-2(e1370) dauer formation to a level similar to daf-18 RNAi (Figure
1C).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our top candidate, fem-2 (T19C3.4) functions in C. elegans sex determination (Kimble et al.,
1984; Pilgrim et al., 1995). However, further analysis with an additional daf-2 allele, daf-2
(e1368), revealed that fem-2 RNAi suppresses dauer formation in an allele-specific manner.
fem-2 RNAi suppressed dauer formation of daf-2(e1370) but not daf-2(e1368) (data not shown)
and therefore, we focused on the next top candidate.
pptr-1 (W08G11.4), the next candidate, is a member of the B56 family of genes encoding
regulatory subunits of the PP2A protein phosphatase holoenzyme. The C. elegans genome
contains 7 known PP2A regulatory subunit genes (pptr-1 and pptr-2, B56 family; sur-6, B55
family; F47B8.3, C06G1.5, rsa-1 and T22D1.5, B72 family; currently F47B8.3 is not annotated
as a PP2A regulatory subunit according to WormBase Release WS194). To determine the
specificity of pptr-1 in regulating dauer formation, we re-tested the six PP2A regulatory
subunits included in the screen for their ability to regulate dauer formation in daf-2(e1370)
mutants. Knockdown efficiency of each RNAi clone was verified by RT PCR (Supplemental
Table 1A). As shown in Figure 1D and Supplemental Table 1A and 1B, only pptr-1 RNAi
suppressed daf-2(e1370) dauer formation comparable to daf-18 RNAi.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next analyzed the effect of pptr-1 RNAi on dauer formation of daf-2(e1368). pptr-1 RNAi
significantly suppressed the dauer formation of daf-2(e1368) (69.2 ± 9.4 % on vector RNAi
versus 3.8 ± 4.4% on pptr-1 RNAi; Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2). Therefore the effect
of pptr-1 RNAi on daf-2 mutants is not allele-specific. Together these results indicate that
pptr-1 may function downstream of daf-2. In addition, pptr-1 is the only PP2A regulatory
subunit to affect daf-2 dauer formation.
pptr-1 regulates dauer formation through the IIS pathway
To further investigate the role of pptr-1 in dauer formation, we performed genetic epistasis
analysis. In addition to the C. elegans IIS pathway, a second parallel TGF-β pathway also
regulates dauer formation (Patterson and Padgett, 2000; Savage-Dunn, 2005). In this pathway,
loss of function mutations in daf-7 (TGF- β ligand), daf-1 and daf-4 (receptors) or daf-14 and
daf-8 (R-Smads) lead to constitutive dauer formation; loss-of-function mutations in daf-3 (CoSmad) or daf-5 (Sno/Ski) suppress these phenotypes (da Graca et al., 2004; Gunther et al.,
2000; Inoue and Thomas, 2000; Patterson et al., 1997; Ren et al., 1996). However, mutations
in daf-3 do not suppress daf-2(e1370) dauer formation (Vowels and Thomas, 1992). We
generated a daf-2(e1370);daf-3(mgDf90) double mutant, which bears a null mutation in

daf-3 (Patterson et al., 1997) which essentially removes the input from the TGF- β pathway
for dauer formation. In this strain, the dauer formation of daf-2(e1370);daf-3(mgDf90) worms
was suppressed by pptr-1 RNAi (94.5 ± 0.8 % dauers on vector RNAi to 42.7 ± 14.6. % dauers
on pptr-1 RNAi; Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2). This data suggests that pptr-1 controls
dauer formation specifically through the IIS pathway and not the TGF-β pathway.
pptr-1 affects longevity, metabolism and stress response downstream of the IIS receptor
In addition to dauer formation, the C. elegans IIS pathway also regulates lifespan, fat storage
and stress resistance (Antebi, 2007; Kenyon, 2005; Wolff and Dillin, 2006). Since pptr-1
regulates dauer formation specifically via the IIS pathway, we next determined whether this
gene could also affect these other important phenotypes.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mutations in daf-2 result in lifespan extension (Kenyon et al., 1993) that is suppressed by lossof-function mutations in daf-18 (Dorman et al., 1995; Larsen et al., 1995). To investigate
whether pptr-1 can regulate lifespan similar to daf-18, we determined whether knocking down
pptr-1 by RNAi could affect daf-2(e1370) lifespan. We grew wild type and daf-2(e1370)
worms on vector, daf-18 and pptr-1 RNAi and measured lifespan (Figure 2A). Similar to
daf-18 RNAi, knockdown of pptr-1 resulted in a significant reduction in daf-2(e1370) lifespan
(mean lifespan of daf-2(e1370) on vector RNAi is 33.9 ± 0.7 days, on pptr-1 RNAi is 27.7 ±
0.9 days and on daf-18 RNAi is 20.4 ± 0.6 days, p value < 0.0001; Figure 2A and Supplemental
Table 3A). In contrast, lifespan of wild type was unaffected by pptr-1 RNAi (mean lifespan of
wild type on vector RNAi is 22.8 ± 0.4 days, is 21.9 ± 0.5 days on pptr-1 RNAi and 18.6 ± 0.3
days on daf-18 RNAi; Figure 2B and Supplemental Table 3A). Thus, pptr-1 affects lifespan
in addition to dauer formation.
Lifespan extension correlates well with increased stress resistance (Lithgow and Walker,
2002; Oh et al., 2005). For example, daf-2(e1370) mutants are not only long-lived but are also
extremely resistant to various stresses such as heat and oxidative stress (Honda and Honda,
1999; Lithgow et al., 1995; Munoz and Riddle, 2003). Therefore, we next analyzed the effect
of pptr-1 RNAi on the thermotolerance of daf-2(e1370) mutants. As anticipated, pptr-1 RNAi
significantly reduced the thermotolerance of daf-2(e1370) mutants (on vector RNAi, daf-2
(e1370) had a mean survival of 15.2 ± 0.7 hrs, whereas on pptr-1 RNAi survival was 13.8 ±
0.5 hrs (p value< 0.006). pptr-1 RNAi did not affect the thermotolerance of wild type worms;
mean thermotolerance was 9.8 ± 0.4 hrs on vector RNAi, versus 9.3 ± 0.3 hrs on pptr-1 RNAi;
Figure 2C and Supplemental Table 4).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to enhanced lifespan and stress resistance, daf-2 mutants have increased fat storage
(Ashrafi et al., 2003; Kimura et al., 1997). We next asked whether pptr-1 could also affect fat
storage in wild type and daf-2(e1370) worms using Sudan black staining. Consistent with our
lifespan and stress resistance results, pptr-1 RNAi suppressed the increased fat storage of daf-2
(e1370) without affecting wild type fat storage (Figure 2D). Finally, daf-2 mutants have a slow
growth phenotype (Gems et al., 1998; Jensen et al., 2007) that is suppressed by knockdown of
daf-16 by RNAi (Supplemental Table 5). Similar to daf-16 RNAi and daf-18 RNAi, pptr-1
RNAi suppresses this slow growth phenotype. Together, these experiments suggest that
pptr-1 regulates multiple phenotypes associated with the IIS pathway in C. elegans.
pptr-1 functions at the level of akt-1
Signals from DAF-2 are transduced to the PI 3-kinase AGE-1 to activate the downstream
serine/threonine kinase PDK-1. PDK-1 activates three downstream serine/threonine kinases,
AKT-1, AKT-2 and SGK-1 (Antebi, 2007; Kenyon, 2005; Wolff and Dillin, 2006). These
kinases together regulate the transcription factor DAF-16 by direct phosphorylation (Hertweck
et al., 2004). Mutations in daf-16 suppress the enhanced dauer formation of pdk-1 (Paradis et

al., 1999) or akt-1/akt-2 mutants (Oh et al., 2005; Paradis and Ruvkun, 1998). Thus far, our
analysis suggests that pptr-1 functions in the IIS pathway. We sought to identify the potential
target of pptr-1 by performing genetic epistasis experiments on components of the IIS pathway.
First we analyzed the effect of pptr-1 RNAi on dauer formation of a pdk-1 mutant. Dauer
formation of pdk-1(sa680) was suppressed by pptr-1 RNAi (95.6 ± 1.0 % dauers on vector
RNAi versus 9.5 ± 0.3 % dauers on pptr-1 RNAi, Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2). In
contrast, daf-18 RNAi had no effect on pdk-1(sa680) dauer formation (Table 1 and
Supplemental Table 2). Therefore, these results place pptr-1 downstream of pdk-1 and are
consistent with the current understanding that daf-18 acts upstream of pdk-1.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, to investigate whether pptr-1 acts at the level of akt-1, akt-2 or sgk-1, we first analyzed
dauer formation in akt-1(ok525), akt-2(ok393) and sgk-1(ok538) single mutants and the akt-1
(ok525);akt-2(ok393) double mutant. While akt-1(ok525), akt-2(ok393) and sgk-1(ok538)
single mutants do not arrest as dauers at either 20 or 25 °C, the akt-1(ok525);akt-2(ok393)
double mutant forms 100% dauers at all temperatures (Oh et al., 2005). To circumvent this
problem, we generated double mutants of daf-2(e1370);akt-1(ok525), daf-2(e1370);akt-2
(ok393) and daf-2(e1370);sgk-1(ok538) and tested these strains for dauer formation on vector,
daf-18 and pptr-1 RNAi. We reasoned that in a daf-2 mutant background, the akt-1, akt-2 and
sgk-1 mutants would exhibit temperature-induced dauer formation. Indeed, all three double
mutants were able to form dauers at 20 °C (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2- see panel for
vector RNAi). Importantly, pptr-1 RNAi significantly suppressed dauer formation in daf-2
(e1370);akt-2(ok393) (36.8 ± 3.8 % dauers on vector RNAi versus 10.8 ± 4.3 % on pptr-1
RNAi; Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2). In addition, pptr-1 RNAi suppressed dauer
formation of daf-2(e1370);sgk-1(ok538) worms (65.4 ± 4.9 % dauers on vector RNAi versus
0 % on pptr-1 RNAi, Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2). In contrast, pptr-1 RNAi did not
affect dauer formation of daf-2(e1370);akt-1(ok525) mutants (vector RNAi is 94.8. ± 3.1 %
versus 96.0 ± 1.7 % on pptr-1 RNAi; Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2). However, daf-18
RNAi can suppress daf-2(e1370) akt-1(ok525) dauer formation (reduced to 10.5 ± 0.8%; Table
1). These observations genetically place pptr-1 at the level or downstream of akt-1 in the IIS
pathway.
PPTR-1 and AKT-1 are expressed in the same tissues

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since pptr-1 and akt-1 genetically interact, we wanted to investigate whether they have a
common expression pattern. We generated or obtained akt-1∷gfp, akt-2∷gfp, sgk-1∷gfp and we
tagged pptr-1 with mCherry and a minimal flag tag to generate pptr-1∷ mCherry-flag
transgenic worms (hence referred to as pptr-1∷mC-flag; Materials and Methods; GFP/mCFLAG refers to protein while gfp/mC-flag stands for transgene). We made double transgenic
worms by crossing pptr-1∷mC-flag worms to each of the above-mentioned GFP lines. Similar
to published data, we observed AKT-1∷GFP predominantly in the pharynx, several head
neurons, the nerve ring, spermathecae and vulva (Paradis and Ruvkun, 1998); AKT-2∷GFP in
the pharynx (predominantly in the anterior region), somatic muscles, vulva muscles,
spermathecae (Paradis and Ruvkun, 1998); SGK-1∷GFP in amphid neurons, intestine and some
tail neurons (Hertweck et al., 2004) (Figure 3A, B, C middle panel and Supplemental Figure
1). PPTR-1∷mC-FLAG was also observed in the pharynx, head neurons, nerve ring,
spermathecae and vulva (Figure 3A, B, C left panel and Supplemental Figure 1). To observe
the sub-cellular localization of PPTR-1, we stained pptr-1∷mC-flag worms with DAPI
(Materials and Methods). We find that PPTR-1 is predominantly cytosolic with little DAPI
overlap (Supplemental Figure 2 and Supplemental Movies). As shown in Figure 3A-C (Merge)
as well as in the confocal movies (Supplemental Movies), there is remarkable overlap between
the expression patterns of PPTR-1 and AKT-1. We also observed partial overlap between
AKT-2∷GFP and PPTR-1∷mC-FLAG, predominantly in the pharynx (Figure 3B, Merge;

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2010 March 6.

Padmanabhan et al.

Supplemental Movies). SGK-1 and PPTR-1 are expressed in different tissues and we do not
see any significant overlap (Figure 3C, Merge; Supplemental Movies).

PPTR-1 regulates AKT-1 phosphorylation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the genetic epistasis as well as the overlapping expression patterns, we next determined
whether PPTR-1 directly interacts with AKT-1 by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) in C.
elegans. For all biochemical experiments, we used the PD4251 strain as a control. This strain
contains Pmyo-3∷gfp with a mitochondrial localization signal and Pmyo-3∷lacZ-gfp with a
nuclear localization signal (Fire et al., 1998). This strain will be referred to as myo-3∷gfp. We
prepared lysates from mixed-stage akt-1∷gfp; pptr-1∷mC-flag and myo-3∷gfp;
pptr-1∷mcherry-flag transgenic worms. Following immunoprecipitation with either antiFLAG or anti-GFP antibody, we found that PPTR-1 specifically interacts with AKT-1 and not
with MYO-3∷GFP (Figure 4A; Materials and Methods). We also performed co-IP experiments
to investigate whether PPTR-1 and AKT-2 interact, since we observed partial overlap in
expression pattern of these proteins. We find that PPTR-1 does not interact with AKT-2
(Supplemental Figure 3). Our epistasis analyses show no genetic interaction between pptr-1
and sgk-1. Moreover, we observe no overlap in the expression pattern of these two proteins
using confocal microscopy (Supplemental Movies). However, we find that PPTR-1∷mCFLAG and SGK-1∷GFP can interact in our co-IP experiments (Supplemental Figure 3). We
do not believe this biochemical interaction to have a measurable functional output and did not
pursue it further.
In mammals, Akt is activated by PDK phosphorylation at Thr 308 and PDK-2/TORC-2 protein
complex at Ser 473 (Brazil and Hemmings, 2001; Sarbassov et al., 2005). In C. elegans AKT-1,
these sites correspond to Thr 350 and Ser 517, respectively. We generated affinity-purified
phospho-specific antibodies (21st Century BioChemicals, USA; Materials and Methods)
against both sites to further investigate the role of PPTR-1 on AKT-1 phosphorylation.
Following immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody from either akt-1∷gfp or
akt-1∷gfp;pptr-1∷mC-flag strain, we compared the phosphorylation status at these two sites.
We find that overexpressing PPTR-1 can dramatically decrease the phosphorylation of the
T350 site while having a marginal effect on the Ser 517 site (Figure 4B). As a control
experiment, we treated the immunoprecipitated AKT-1∷GFP samples with lambda
phosphatase and observed loss of the Thr and Ser phosphorylation, showing the specificity of
the phospho-AKT antibodies (Supplemental Figure 4A). Thus, in C. elegans, PPTR-1
functions by directly regulating the dephosphorylation of AKT-1 primarily at the Thr 350
(mammalian Thr 308) site.
Mammalian PPTR-1 homolog regulates AKT-1 phosphorylation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the evolutionary conservation of the C. elegans IIS pathway, we next determined if this
mechanism of AKT-1 dephosphorylation mediated by PPTR-1 is also conserved in mammals.
The mammalian B56 family of PP2A regulatory subunits has 8 members encoded by 5 genes
that express in different tissues (Eichhorn et al., 2008). We used 3T3-L1 adipocytes to perform
these studies since in this system, there is a well-characterized insulin signaling pathway that
is responsive to changes in insulin levels (Ugi et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2004). We first
compared microarray data from the expression profiles of fibroblasts to differentiated 3T3-L1
adipocytes (Powelka et al., 2006) to determine which B56 members were expressed in the
adipocytes. We identified 2 genes, PPP2R5A (B56α) and PPP2R5B (B56β) as the top
candidates. We knocked down either one or both these regulatory subunits by designing
Smartpool siRNAs (Dharmacon, USA) and verified the silencing by quantitative RT PCR
(Supplemental Figure 3B). Serum-starved siRNA-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were then
stimulated with increasing concentrations of insulin. The cells were lysed and the proteins
analyzed by western blotting using mammalian Akt phospho-specific antibodies (Materials

and Methods). Knockdown of B56β results in a dramatic increase in phosphorylation at the
Thr 308 site of Akt with relatively less changes in Ser 473 phosphorylation (Figure 4C).
However, silencing of B56α had no effect on the phosphorylation status of Akt at either site.
We observed that siRNA against both the PP2A catalytic subunits (PP2Acα/β) results in
increased phosphorylation at Thr 308 but not at Ser 473. Together, our data suggests that
PPTR-1/B56β regulatory subunits function to modulate AKT-1 phosphorylation in a conserved
manner across phylogeny.
PPTR-1 positively regulates DAF-16 nuclear localization and activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

DAF-16 nuclear localization—We next determined the consequences of modulating
PPTR-1 dosage on the IIS pathway. In C. elegans, one of the major targets of AKT-1 is the
forkhead transcription factor, DAF-16. Active signaling through the IIS pathway results in the
phosphorylation of DAF-16 by AKT-1, AKT-2 and SGK-1, leading to its nuclear exclusion
(Antebi, 2007; Kenyon, 2005; Wolff and Dillin, 2006). However, under low signaling
conditions, DAF-16 translocates into the nucleus, where it can directly bind and activate/
repress the transcription of target genes involved in dauer formation, lifespan, stress resistance
and fat storage (Oh et al., 2006). We asked whether pptr-1 regulates IIS pathway-specific
phenotypes by modulating DAF-16 function. Since we observed reduced phosphorylation of
AKT-1 upon overexpression of PPTR-1, we first looked at the effect of PPTR-1 overexpression
on DAF-16 nuclear localization (Henderson and Johnson, 2001; Lee et al., 2001; Lin et al.,
2001). We generated a daf-16∷gfp;pptr-1∷mC-flag strain and then compared the DAF-16
nuclear localization in these worms with a daf-16∷gfp strain (Figure 5A and Supplemental
Figure 5A). We categorized DAF-16∷GFP localization as completely cytosolic, mostly
cytosolic, mostly nuclear or completely nuclear. We find that DAF-16∷GFP nuclear
localization is enhanced when PPTR-1 is overexpressed (Figure 5A and Supplemental Figure
5A). To determine the specificity of this response, we used mCherry RNAi to effectively
knockdown mCherry expression in pptr-1∷mC-flag thereby reducing the expression of
pptr-1 transgene (data not shown). Our results show that the enhanced nuclear localization
upon PPTR-1 overexpression is suppressed when pptr-1∷mC-flag;daf-16∷gfp worms are
grown on mCherry RNAi (Figure 5A and Supplemental Figure 5A) and mCherry RNAi has
little effect on DAF-16 localization in daf-16∷gfp worms. These experiments suggest that
increased dosage of pptr-1 affects DAF-16 nuclear localization. Consistent with its role in the
C. elegans IIS pathway, we find that overexpression of pptr-1 significantly increases the
lifespan of wild type worms but does not further enhance the lifespan daf-2(e1370) worms
(Figure 5B and Supplemental Table 3B; mean lifespan of wild type is 23.9 ± 0.3 days,
pptr-1∷mC-flag is 30.1 ± 0.5 days, p<.0001, and the unc-119(+); unc-119(ed3) control strain
is 22.6 ± 0.3 days).

As a corollary to this experiment, we next looked at the effect of pptr-1RNAi on DAF-16
nuclear localization. For this, we generated a strain with a daf-2(e1370);daf-16∷gfp strain. At
the permissive temperature of 15°C, DAF-16∷GFP is excluded from the nucleus in the daf-2
(e1370);daf-16∷gfp strain. However, at the non-permissive temperature of 25 °C, progressive
nuclear localization of DAF-16∷GFP is observed. We grew daf-2(e1370);daf-16∷gfp worms
on either vector, pptr-1 or daf-18 RNAi and measured the extent of nuclear localization at 25
°C. We find that pptr-1 RNAi significantly reduced DAF-16 nuclear localization, similar to
the effect of daf-18 RNAi (Figure 5C and Supplemental Figure 5B). Together, these
experiments suggest that changes in PPTR-1 levels affect the activity of AKT-1 and as a result,
modulate DAF-16 sub-cellular localization.
DAF-16 target genes—DAF-16 regulates the transcription of many downstream genes such
as sod-3, hsp-12.6, sip-1 and mtl-1 (Furuyama et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2003; McElwee et al.,
2003; Murphy et al., 2003; Oh et al., 2006). We next tested the effects of pptr-1 RNAi on these

DAF-16 transcriptional targets. We first tested sod-3 which has been shown to be a direct target
of DAF-16 by chromatin immunoprecipitation (Oh et al., 2006) and its expression changes in
response to modulation of the IIS pathway (Furuyama et al., 2000; Libina et al., 2003; Murphy
et al., 2003). We grew a daf-2(e1370);Psod-3∷gfp(muIs84) strain on either vector, daf-18 or
pptr-1 RNAi to look at the effect on GFP expression. Similar to worms grown on daf-18 RNAi,
pptr-1 RNAi reduces expression of GFP (Figure 5D and Supplemental Figure 5C). Therefore,
modulation in the levels of pptr-1 can affect the expression of direct DAF-16 target genes.
We further analyzed the expression of known DAF-16 target genes by quantitative RT-PCR
in a daf-2(e1370) mutant background. As a control, we analyzed whether each of these target
genes expressed in a daf-16-dependent manner as previously reported (McElwee et al., 2003;
Murphy et al., 2003; Oh et al., 2006). As shown in Figure 5E and Supplemental Figure 5D,
daf-16 RNAi dramatically suppressed the expression levels of these genes. Next, we tested the
effects of either pptr-1 or daf-18 RNAi on the expression of these genes. We found that
pptr-1 RNAi also suppressed the expression of these genes to a level similar to daf-18 RNAi.
Taken together, our data suggests that PPTR-1 positively regulates DAF-16 nuclear
localization and thereby its activity.

Discussion
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In a directed RNAi screen for Ser/Thr phosphatases in the C. elegans IIS pathway, we identified
pptr-1, a B6 regulatory subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. PP2A itself is a ubiquitously
expressed phosphatase that is involved in multiple cellular processes including regulation of
insulin signaling by direct dephosphorylation of Akt (Andjelkovic et al., 1996; Resjo et al.,
2002; Ugi et al., 2004). Substrate specificity of PP2A is achieved by its association with distinct
regulatory subunits. Our studies provide a mechanistic insight into how the C. elegans PP2A
regulatory subunit PPTR-1 modulates insulin signaling by specifically regulating AKT-1
phosphorylation and activity in the context of a whole organism.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In our model (Figure 5F), PPTR-1 acts to negatively regulate signals transduced through the
IIS pathway, ultimately controlling the activity of the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16.
Under low signaling conditions, DAF-16 is able to translocate to the nucleus and transactivate
or repress its downstream targets. It is well established that AKT modulates DAF-16 subcellular localization. Thus, the activity of AKT-1, as governed by its phosphorylation status,
directly translates into the activity of DAF-16. In this study, we show that PPTR-1 directly
interacts with AKT-1 and regulates its activity by modulating its phosphorylation,
predominantly at the Thr 350 site. Less active AKT-1 results in increased DAF-16 nuclear
localization. Indeed, DAF-16 is found to be more nuclear throughout the worm when PPTR-1
is overexpressed. As a corollary, knocking down pptr-1 by RNAi results in less nuclear DAF-16
as well as reduced expression of DAF-16 target genes such as sod-3, hsp-12.6, mtl-1 and
sip-1. These genes are known to play a combinatorial role in adaptation to various stresses,
leading to enhanced dauer formation and increased lifespan. Consistent with the decreased
levels of these important genes, pptr-1 RNAi results in a significant decrease in the dauer
formation, lifespan, thermotolerance of daf-2(e1370) mutants. In addition, pptr-1 also regulates
other DAF-16-dependent outputs of the IIS pathway such as fat storage. Thus, we find that
normal levels of pptr-1 are important under low insulin signaling conditions. However,
pptr-1 RNAi does not affect IIS pathway-associated phenotypes in wild type worms. There
could be several reasons for this observation. Firstly, under normal signaling conditions,
AKT-1, AKT-2 as well as SGK-1 are active and negatively regulate DAF-16. Therefore,
changes in the AKT-1 activity alone brought about by pptr-1 RNAi may not have a significant
effect on DAF-16-dependent phenotypes. Secondly, PPTR-1 itself may be negatively regulated
by the IIS pathway, leading to increased AKT-1 phosphorylation. Along similar lines, in
mammals, insulin signaling can downregulate the expression and activity of the PP2A catalytic

subunit (Hojlund et al., 2002; Srinivasan and Begum, 1994; Ugi et al., 2004). Thus, under
normal conditions, further down regulation of pptr-1 by RNAi may have no effect. We
speculate that in C elegans, in response to changing environmental cues, PPTR-1 helps to
downregulate the insulin signaling pathway to promote DAF-16 activity, enabling the worm
to either enter diapause or enhance its tolerance to stress as adults.

In mammals, Akt controls a myriad of secondary signaling cascades that regulate glucose
transport, protein synthesis, genomic stability, cell survival and gene expression (Toker and
Yoeli-Lerner, 2006). Previous studies have implicated roles for PP2A and PHLPP
phosphatases in the negative regulation of Akt (Kuo et al., 2008). The PP2A inhibitor Okadaic
acid can increase Akt phosphorylation predominantly at Thr 308 and enhance glucose transport
in adipocytes (Rondinone et al., 1999). Consistent with this, our results show that siRNA
knockdown of the PP2A catalytic subunit and more importantly, the B56β regulatory subunit
results in enhanced Akt phosphorylation at Thr 308 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Thus, our study
points at the remarkable functional conservation of the B56/PPTR-1 regulatory subunit of
PP2A in regulating AKT phosphorylation between C. elegans and higher mammals. In worms,
we also see a modest effect on Ser 517 (equivalent to mammalian Ser 473) phosphorylation
by PPTR-1 overexpression. However, we do not observe a difference in Ser 473
phosphorylation in adipocytes. This difference may be explained by the fact that in worms, we
are determining the phosphorylation of AKT-1 in the context of a whole organism.
Additionally, in mammals phosphorylation state of one Akt site may influence the status of
the other (Gao et al., 2005; Toker and Newton, 2000). We do not see a role for the PP2A B55
subunit (sur-6) in the C. elegans IIS pathway. However, a recent report using cell culture has
implicated the mammalian B55 in the regulation of AKT (Kuo et al., 2008).
Dysregulation of Akt has been implicated in diseases such as cancer and diabetes (Rondinone
et al., 1999; Sasaoka et al., 2006; Smith et al., 1999; Zdychova and Komers, 2005). In fact, the
onset of diabetes is often associated with changes in Akt phosphorylation (Zdychova and
Komers, 2005). In several cancer models, loss of function mutations in the PTEN results in
hyper-phosphorylated and activated Akt (Groszer et al., 2001; Hakem and Mak, 2001; Stiles
et al., 2002; Testa and Bellacosa, 2001) Our studies show that like PTEN, PPTR-1 acts to
negatively regulate the insulin/IGF-1 signaling. Given the important role of PPTR-1/B56 in
modulating Akt activity, this protein may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of
diabetes as well as cancer.

1% Triton X-100, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, Protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Biochemicals, USA), pH 7.4). The worms were sonicated with Bioruptor (Diagenode, USA)
using maximum power output (1 min sonication, 2 min off-repeated 10 times). The lysate was
cleared by centrifugation and protein content estimated by Bradford method. Lysate equivalent
to 1.5 mg total protein was pre-cleared with 50 μl of protein-G agarose beads, fast flow (Upstate,
USA) and then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using either anti-GFP monoclonal
antibody (Sigma, USA) or anti-FLAG M2 gel (Sigma, USA). The following morning, 50 μl
protein-G agarose beads, fast flow were added to the GFP IP to capture the immune complex.
The agarose beads were then washed 5 times with lysis buffer. Following this step, the beads
were boiled in Laemelli's buffer.
For western blot analysis, immunoprecipitated protein samples was resolved on a 10% SDSPAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in TBST (Tris
Buffered Saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, ph 7.4) containing 5% non-fat milk at RT for 1
hour. Membranes were then washed with TBST and incubated overnight with 1:1000 dilutions
of antibodies in TBST containing 5% non-fat milk 4 °C. Membranes were washed 3 times with
TBST and then incubated with TBST containing 5% non-fat milk containing a 1:10,000

pptr-1 regulates lifespan, thermotolerance and fat-storage through the IIS pathway. Data shown
are from one representative experiment.
A) pptr-1 RNAi significantly reduces the lifespan of daf-2(e1370) mutants similar to daf-18
RNAi (mean life on vector RNAi is 33.9 ± 0.7 days (n=77), pptr-1 RNAi is 27.7 ± 0.9 days
(n=63) p <0.0001and on daf-18 RNAi is 20.4 ± 0.6 days (n=40), p <0.0001)
B) pptr-1 RNAi does not affect the lifespan of wild-type worms (mean lifespan on vector RNAi
is 22.8 ± 0.4 days (n=61), pptr-1 RNAi is 21.9 ± 0.5 days (n=49). daf-18 RNAi reduces mean
lifespan of wild type worms to 18.6 ± 0.3 days (n=48) p <0.0001).
C) The thermotolerance of daf-2(e1370) worms is reduced by pptr-1 as well as daf-18 RNAi
(mean survival of daf-2(e1370) worms at 37 °C on vector RNAi was 15.2 ± 0.7 hrs (n=34),
whereas on pptr-1 RNAi the survival was 13.8 ± 0.5 hrs (p value< 0.006) (n=36) and 10.3 ±
0.7 hrs (p value< 0.0001) (n=29) on daf-18 RNAi. pptr-1 RNAi did not affect the
thermotolerance of wild type worms; (mean survival was 9.8 ± 0.4 hrs on vector RNAi (n=32),
9.3 ± 0.3 hrs on pptr-1 RNAi (n=35) and 9.7 ± 0.4 hrs on daf-18 RNAi (n=32).
D) Sudan black staining showing that pptr-1 RNAi reduces the increased fat storage of daf-2
(e1370) worms, similar to daf-18 RNAi but has no effect on wild type fat-storage. Arrows

PPTR-1 interacts with and modulates AKT-1 phosphorylation. Data shown are from one
representative experiment
A) PPTR-1 directly interacts with AKT-1 in C. elegans. AKT-1∷GFP and MYO-3∷GFP were
immunoprecipated (IP) using anti-GFP antibody and were analyzed by western blotting (WB)
using anti-Ds-Red or anti-GFP antibodies. In addition, PPTR-1∷mC-FLAG was
immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and analysed by WB using using anti-Ds-Red
or anti-GFP antibodies. Lysates were used for WB analysis.
B) PPTR-1 overexpression reduces AKT-1 phosphorylation in C. elegans. AKT-1∷GFP and
MYO-3∷GFP were immunoprecipitated from akt-1∷gfp, akt-1∷gfp;pptr-1∷mC-flag and
myo-3∷gfp;pptr-1∷mC-flag followed by western blotting using pThr 350 or pSer 517 antibodies
(upper panels). Total lysates were analyzed by western blotting (lower panels). Quantification
of changes in AKT-1∷GFP phosphorylation upon PPTR-1 overexpression is shown below each
lane.
C) Knockdown of the mammalian B56β regulatory subunit by siRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes
increases insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation at Thr 308. The 3T3-L1 adipocytes were
transfected with scrambled (Scr), PP2Acα/β, B56α, B56 β or B56α/β siRNA. These cells were
then treated with increasing concentrations of insulin and phosphorylation status of Akt was
analyzed by western blotting using pThr 308 (left) and pSer 473 antibodies (middle). Total Akt

PPTR-1 regulates DAF-16 localization and activity. Data shown are from one representative
experiment.
A) Over-expression of PPTR-1 promotes DAF-16 nuclear translocation. On vector RNAi,
DAF-16 is more enriched in the nucleus in a pptr-1∷mC-flag;daf-16∷gfp strain, compared to
a daf-16∷gfp strain. This effect is specific to the functional transgene, as knocking down
pptr-1∷mC-flag with mCherry RNAi decreases the extent of nuclear DAF-16.
B) Overexpression of PPTR-1 significantly increases the lifespan of wild type worms. Mean
lifespan of wild type worms is 23.9 ± 0.3 days (n=154), pptr-1∷mC-flag is 30.1 ± 0.5 days
(n=202), p<.0001, and the unc-119(+); unc-119(ed3) control strain is 22.6 ± 0.3 days (n=145).
C) In a daf-2(e1370);daf-16∷gfp strain, DAF-16 is enriched in the nucleus on vector RNAi,
whereas on pptr-1 RNAi as well as daf-18 RNAi, DAf-16 is mostly cytosolic.
D) pptr-1 RNAi affects DAF-16 transcriptional activity. sod-3 is one of the direct targets of
DAF-16. pptr-1 RNAi reduces Psod-3∷GFP expression in a daf-2(e1370);Psod-3∷gfp
(muIs84) strain, similar to daf-18 RNAi.
E) Transcript abundance of known DAF-16 target genes decrease when daf-2(e1370) worms
are grown on pptr-1 RNAi, similar to daf-18 RNAi, as detected by real-time PCR.
F) Proposed model illustrating the role of PPTR-1 in the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway.
Signals from DAF-2 are processed by a PI3-kinase pathway that leads to the phosphorylation
and activation of downstream serine/threonine kinases such as PDK-1, AKT-1, AKT-2 and
SGK-1. PPTR-1, the PP2A holoenzyme regulatory subunit, regulates the dephosphorylation
and activation status of AKT-1 at T350. This in turn affects the nuclear translocation of DAF-16
