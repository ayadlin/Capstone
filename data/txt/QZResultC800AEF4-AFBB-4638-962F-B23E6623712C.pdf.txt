ABSTRACT
Picropodophyllin (PPP) is an anticancer drug undergoing clinical development in
NSCLC. PPP has been shown to suppress IGF-1R signaling and to induce a G2/M cell
cycle phase arrest but the exact mechanisms remain to be elucidated.
The present study identified an IGF-1-independent mechanism of PPP leading to
pro-metaphase arrest. The mitotic block was induced in human cancer cell lines and
in an A549 xenograft mouse but did not occur in normal hepatocytes/mouse tissues.
Cell cycle arrest by PPP occurred in vitro and in vivo accompanied by prominent
CDK1 activation, and was IGF-1R-independent since it occurred also in IGF-1Rdepleted and null cells. The tumor cells were not arrested in G2/M but in mitosis.
Centrosome separation was prevented during mitotic entry, resulting in a monopolar
mitotic spindle with subsequent prometaphase-arrest, independent of Plk1/Aurora A
or Eg5, and leading to cell features of mitotic catastrophe. PPP also increased soluble
tubulin and decreased spindle-associated tubulin within minutes, indicating that it
interfered with microtubule dynamics.
These results provide a novel IGF-1R-independent mechanism of antitumor
effects of PPP.

INTRODUCTION

IGF-1R antibodies exhibited relatively weak anti-tumor
effects in preclinical models [8, 9], and have yielded
disappointing clinical data [1, 10]. Thus, raising the
question whether PPP has other targets. PPP is presently
undergoing clinical development in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) and in glioblastoma. Tumor response
was indicated in NSCLC patients included in the first
clinical study, despite PPP given as third or fourth line
treatment [11, 12].
Although the exact mechanism has not been
established, PPP has been shown to suppress signaling in
the IGF-1R pathway, reflected in enhanced degradation

The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway has been suggested as a target for
cancer therapy based on studies showing that the (IGF1R) is important for cancer cell growth and survival, and
is often overexpressed in malignant [1] and premalignant
tissues [2]. Inhibition of tumor growth in vivo has been
achieved with anti-IGF-1R antibodies, anti-ligand
antibodies, receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
and agents such as the cyclolignan picropodophyllin (PPP)
[1]. However, compared to PPP [3-7] treatment with antiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the receptor and reduction of phosphorylated IGF1R, as well as reduction of phosphorylated down-stream
signaling proteins [3, 6, 13-19]. Treatment with PPP has
been shown to induce apoptosis [3, 14, 15, 19-21], reduced
cell motility [6, 18], and to inhibit tumor growth in
xenografted mice [3, 13, 21] and in mouse tumor models
[4, 5, 7]. Another characteristic outcome of treatment
with PPP is the accumulation of tumor cells in the G2/M
phase of the cell cycle [14, 17, 19, 20]. Interestingly, this
distinguishes PPP from other molecules directly targeting
the IGF-1R.
One of the key regulators of the G2/M phase
transition, M-phase progression [22, 23] as well as
apoptosis [24, 25] is Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)
in complex with cyclin B1. The CDK1/cyclin B1 complex
also phosphorylates and activates enzymes regulating the
mitosis-specific microtubule reorganization [26-29]. It was
therefore hypothesized that the activity of this complex is
affected directly or indirectly by PPP. Using the distinctive

PPP-induced G2/M-accumulation as a starting-point, the
aim of this study was to further investigate the antitumor
mechanism of action of this compound. We identified a
novel, IGF-1R-independent mechanism involving an early
and sustained mitotic arrest associated with pronounced
activation of CDK1 in vitro and in vivo. Depending on the
duration of mitotic delay, some tumor cells showed signs
of mitotic catastrophe.

RESULTS
PPP reduced viability and induced G2/M arrest in
cancer cell lines independent of IGF-1R
Treatment of HCC cell lines expressing different
levels of IGF-1R with PPP reduced the percentage of
viable cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S1). These

results were confirmed using the trypan blue exclusion
assay. Since one of our goals was to investigate the
mechanism of PPP action from a cell cycle point of view,
we determined the lowest concentration (0.5 µM) that
induced pronounced reduction of cell growth without
massive cell death, and used this concentration for further
experiments in this study. Analysis by flow cytometry
showed that 24 h treatment with PPP induced G2/M phase
accumulation in HCC, A549 and R+MEF (igf1r-/- cells
overexpressing human IGFIR) cell lines, while normal
human hepatocytes (nHeps) were not affected (Fig. 1A).
The igf1r-/- (R-MEFs), although being deficient for the
IGF-1R, also showed G2/M-accumulation in response
to PPP (Fig. 1A). Kinetic studies demonstrated that the
fraction of cells in the G2/M-phase increased already at 4
h and peaked between 16 and 24 h (Fig. 1B). The slight
differences in response between cell lines probably reflect
differences in doubling time. Similarly, data was obtained
in the ex vivo analysis of A549 xenografts. PPP induced
a 1.5 to 3-fold increase of tumor cells in the G2/M phase,
whereas no G2/M-accumulation was observed in the
normal lung tissue (Fig. 1C and D).

activation in all tumor cell lines (Fig. 2A, B, C) and in the
A549 xenografts (Fig. 2D), whereas no CDK1 activation
was detected in normal human hepatocytes or in normal
lung tissue (Fig. 2C, D). CDK1 activation was evident
in HepG2 cells as early as 2 h after PPP addition and
persisted until 48 h. Quantitative analysis demonstrated a
2.2-fold elevation of CDK1 activity at 4 h, increasing to
21-fold at 8 h (Fig. 2A, B)

PPP-mediated CDK1 activation was associated
with an early increase in Cyclin B1 and CDK1pT161
Potential direct effects of PPP on CDK1 were
analyzed in cell-free kinase assays, indicating no effects
on CDK1/Cyclin A, CDK1/Cyclin E and CDK1/Cyclin B1
(data not shown). The protein levels and phosphorylation
of CDK1 and its regulators following PPP treatment
were studied using Western blot (Fig. 3). In comparison
to control, treatment of HepG2 cells with PPP increased
Cyclin B1 protein level 2.8-fold at 8 h (Fig. 3A, D),
correlating with an increase in transcription (Fig. 3E).
After 24 h the level of Cyclin B1 in PPP treated cells was
similar to the control, and not detectable at 72 h (Fig. 3A,
B, D). Similarly, the PPP-induced CDK1activity also
returned to the control (untreated) levels at 72 h (Fig. 2
A,B). In addition, the amount of Cyclin B1 complexed
with CDK1 increased in response to PPP (Fig. 3C). The
activating phosphorylation CDK1pT161 followed the same
pattern as Cyclin B1 protein level/CDK1 activation, with
a corresponding decrease in the inhibitory phosphorylation

CDK1 activity was upregulated in cancer cells
both in vitro and in vivo after PPP treatment
Since G2/M transition and M phase progression is
driven by CDK1/Cyclin B, we assessed whether the PPP
–induced G2/M accumulation was caused by alterations in
CDK1 activity. PPP treatment was associated with CDK1

PPP induced mitotic arrest in cancer cell lines

CDK1pY15 (Fig. 3A, D). Similar results were obtained in
the A549 cell line, but with slightly different kinetics.
Cyclin B1 could not be detected in the tumor tissue of the
PPP-treated A549 xenografts (Fig. S2).

Cells are expected to arrest in G2 if the CDK1/
Cyclin B1 complex is inactive. However, PPP treatment
yielded increased CDK1 activity. One possible explanation
would be that the cell cycle arrest corresponded to
accumulation of mitotic cells having high CDK1/Cyclin
B1 activity. To investigate this hypothesis, arrested cells
were analyzed by flow cytometry using the mitosis marker
phosphorylated histone H3 (pH3). This confirmed that the
cells were in fact accumulated in mitosis (Fig. 4A). In
PPP-treated HepG2 cells the percentage of pH3-positive
cells increased after PPP addition to 4- and 3-fold at 8
and 24h, respectively. Similar effects were observed in
Hep3B and A549 cells (Fig. 4A). The potential effect of
IGF-1R on the mitotic arrest was assessed in a knockdown experiment in Hep3B cells using siRNA, showing
that IGF-1R depletion did not affect the PPP-induced
accumulation of cells in mitosis (Fig. 4B).
Time-lapse video microscopy showed that many
cells rounded up after PPP addition and contained pH3positive condensed DNA, without signs of chromosome

PPP induced apoptosis in cancer cell lines
PPP was previously reported to induce apoptosis and
CDK1 is known to regulate apoptosis. In the present study
PPP induced 2.5 to 3-fold increase in apoptosis compared
to controls (statistically significant only in HepG2 and
MCF-7 cells) (Fig. S3A, B) with reduced levels of Mcl-1
(Fig. S3C, D). In addition, PARP cleavage was observed
in MCF-7 cells after 48 h of PPP treatment (Fig. S3D). To
investigate whether these alterations were due to CDK1
activity we depleted CDK1 using specific siRNA in MCF7 cells. Depletion of CDK1 (by 80-90 %) resulted in
reduced Mcl-1 levels and PARP and Caspase3 cleavage,
regardless of PPP treatment (Fig. S3D).

Figure 3: PPP induced an early increase in Cyclin B1, phosphorylation of CDK1pT161 and de-phosphorylation of
CDK1Y15. HepG2 cells and nHeps were incubated with vehicle or with PPP for the indicated time points. Cell lysates were separated on

12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE and protein levels were detected by Western blot (15 µg protein loaded per lane). GAPDH served as a loading
control (A, B). The amount of Cyclin B1 in complex with CDK1 was detected by immunoprecipitation of CDK1 followed by Western
blot using a Cyclin B1-specific antibody (C). Densitometric analysis of the Western blots in (A) normalized to GAPDH are represented as

with vehicle (DMSO) (black) normalized to GAPDH are represented as fold-difference (E). Data is presented as mean ± SD of duplicate or
triplicate experiments, and considered significant (*) at p ≤ 0.05. nHep: normal hepatocytes, PPP: picropodophyllin.

PPP arrested cells in pro-metaphase by preventing
the formation of a bipolar spindle and it induced
spindle collapse in metaphase cells

congression, indicating that cells were arrested in prometaphase (Fig. 4C). The mitotic entry/time spent
in mitosis were followed for individual U2OS cells
expressing GFP-Histone H2B. While control cells entered
mitosis linearly, cells treated with PPP showed a minor
delay in interphase (Suppl. movie 1, Fig. 4D). In contrast
to control cells spending less than an hour in mitosis,
mitotic progression was severely delayed immediately
after the addition of PPP (Fig. 4D). This delay was
pronounced also when PPP was added to cells already
in mitosis (Suppl. movie 3). A fraction of PPP-treated
cells eventually died, and the surviving fraction exhibited
abnormal DNA content/polyploidy and enlarged nuclei,
suggesting the involvement of mitotic catastrophe (Fig.
S4A, B).

The molecular mechanism underlying the mitotic
arrest by PPP was investigated by live imaging using
the U2OS cell line expressing GFP-Histone H2B and
mCherry-a-tubulin. Whereas centrosome separation
occurred before visible chromosome condensation in
control cells, centrosomes remained close together during
mitotic entry after PPP addition and a bipolar spindle
never formed, leading to pro-metaphase arrest (Fig. 5A,
Suppl. movie 1). No effects on centrosome maturation
or the kinetics of chromosome condensation during
mitotic entry were observed (Fig. 5A). When cells with
established bipolar mitotic spindle were treated with PPP,
the spindle collapsed and chromosome congression was
reverted, showing that PPP affects both mitotic spindle

assembly and maintenance (Fig. 5B, Suppl. movie 3).
Bipolar spindle assembly depends on Aurora A kinase
and its downstream target polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1),
suggesting that the activity of these proteins might have
been affected by PPP treatment. This was studied using
a FRET-based sensor that monitors Plk1 phosphorylation
in living cells [30]. Whereas the addition of either PPP or
the Plk1 inhibitor BI2536 caused arrest in pro-metaphase,
only BI2536 decreased the inverted FRET-ratio in both
G2 and mitosis. This indicated that PPP did not induce a
mitotic arrest by the inhibition of Aurora A or Plk1 kinase
activities (Fig. 5C, Suppl. movie 2).
Addition of PPP in metaphase led to a gradual
decrease in spindle length that eventually resulted in
bipolar spindle collapse (Fig. 6A, D, Suppl. movie 3).
Centrosome separation and bipolar spindle assembly
mechanistically depend on the motor protein kinesin-5
(Eg5) [31]. However, Eg5 is not essential for maintenance
of a bipolar spindle when cells are arrested in metaphase
[22, 23]. Thus, although addition of the Eg5 inhibitor
STLC before mitosis led to inhibition of centrosome
separation and pro-metaphase arrest (data not shown),

addition of STLC to cells that were arrested in metaphase
by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not lead to a
mitotic spindle collapse (Fig. 6A, D, Suppl. movie 3). In
contrast, addition of PPP in metaphase led to a gradual
decrease in spindle length that eventually resulted in
bipolar spindle collapse, indicating that PPP does not
function through inhibition of Eg5 (Fig. 6A, D, Suppl.
movie 3).

PPP interfered with microtubule dynamics
The effects of PPP on cells arrested in metaphase by
MG132 were compared with the effects of the microtubule
destabilizer Nocodazole (NOC), and the Eg5 inhibitor
STLC. Treatment with PPP or NOC led to a collapse of the
mitotic spindle, whereas STLC did not have any detectable
effect (Fig. 6A, D, Suppl. movie 3). Importantly, whereas
mCherry-a-tubulin distribution remained constant after
STLC or DMSO addition, the addition of either PPP or
NOC in the same phase of cell division led to an increase
in the pool of mCherry-a-tubulin outside of the spindle

Figure 5: PPP interfered with mitotic spindle establishment and maintenance. PPP prevented centrosome separation and

establishment of a bipolar spindle during mitotic entry (A). PPP or DMSO was added to U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-Histone H2B
and mCherry-a-tubulin. Cells entering mitosis were followed with time-lapse microscopy. Images show maximum intensity projections of
Z-stacks with 1µM spacing. Minutes from addition of PPP are indicated. PPP disrupted mitotic spindle integrity and mitotic progression.

(Fig. 6B, Suppl. movie 3), and to a decrease in the amount
of mCherry-a-tubulin associated with the spindle (Fig.
6C, Suppl. movie 3). This phenotype was evident in all 26
PPP-treated cells studied in the experiment.
The potential effects of PPP on microtubule
dynamics during interphase were compared with the
effects of the microtubule depolymerizer colchicine. The
number of cells without visible microtubules was counted
using immunofluorescence microscopy. A substantial
effect was observed 8 h after colchicine addition, whereas
PPP had minor effects (Fig. 7A, B). The effect seen with
PPP at 12 h did reach statistical significance compared
to the starting value for PPP treated cells, but remained
below the starting value for the colchicine treated cells.
Several experiments were performed to investigate
whether PPP might bind directly to microtubules. We
measured displacement of tritiated colchicine, PPP, or
PPT (Fig. S5). Colchicine and PPT competed for binding
to b-tubulin, whereas PPP did not displace colchicine,
despite that a concentration as high as 50 µM was used.

For PPT, this displacement resembled the pattern for cold
colchicine (Fig. S5). In a final competition experiment, no
binding curve for tritiated PPP binding to b-tubulin could
be established. The weak signal could not be blocked with
cold PPP (or cold PPT) confirming that this was not a
result from specific binding. Thus, PPP mediates a mitotic
arrest by interfering with microtubule dynamics, without
binding to b-tubulin.

DISCUSSION
In this study we confirmed that the PPP-induced
G2/M arrest is independent of IGF-1R because it occurred
in igf1r-/- (R-) MEFs and after IGF-1R downregulation
using siRNA in cancer cell lines. The G2/M arrest also
occurred in cancer xenografts in vivo after PPP treatment.
Detailed studies showed that the PPP-induced G2/M
arrest paralleled the activation of Cyclin B1/CDK1 activity
in vitro and in vivo, indicating that cells accumulated in
mitosis. This was confirmed by phospho-histone H3

Figure 6: PPP addition in metaphase led to spindle collapse, increased levels of diffusible mCherry-a-tubulin, and
decreased levels of spindle-associated mCherry-a-tubulin. U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-Histone H2B (H2B) and mCherrya-tubulin (Tub) were blocked in metaphase by treatment with 20 µM MG132 for 1.5h, followed by time-lapse microscopy. After acquisition
of the first image, 0.5 μM PPP, 25 ng/mL Nocodazole (NOC), 40 µM S-Trityl-L-Cysteine (STLC), or DMSO were added (A). Images
show maximum intensity projections of mCherry-a-tubulin, GFP-Histone H2B, and the merged channels (Merge). Time (minutes) from
addition is indicated above images. Top graph shows normalized quantifications on average mCherry fluorescence in area of the cell

positive staining of the growth arrested tumor cells.
Therefore, the “G2/M” arrest observed in the propidium
iodide-based FACS analyses in this and in previous reports
is in fact a mitotic arrest.
Real-time imaging of a U2OS cell line stably
expressing GFP-Histone H2B and mCherry-a-tubulin
confirmed that the cells were arrested in mitosis. Addition
of PPP before mitotic entry inhibited centrosome
separation and the formation of a bipolar mitotic spindle,
leading to pro-metaphase arrest. PPP addition to cells
already in mitosis led to a collapse of the mitotic spindle.
Changes in mitotic spindle structure occurred within 10
minutes after addition of PPP, indicating that PPP acts
directly on a regulator of the mitotic spindle and not
through effects on transcription or protein synthesis.
The effect after addition of PPP during metaphase was
shown to be similar to the effect seen after addition of the
microtubule destabilizer nocodazole (NOC). In both cases
collapse of the mitotic spindle was observed, associated
with decrease in the amount of tubulin associated with
the spindle and concomitant increase in the tubulin pool
outside of the spindle.
Cells cannot remain permanently arrested in
pro-metaphase [32]. In the present study some of the
mitotically arrested cells were found to die in mitosis and
the remaining cells exhibited enlarged polyploid nuclei, a
scenario similar to that described for mitotic catastrophe
[33, 34]. Indeed, cells may survive mitotic arrest by
exiting mitosis without completing cell division (mitotic
slippage) to become multinucleated [34]. It has been
proposed that the inhibition of transcription during mitotic
arrest and its restoration after mitotic slippage explain the
different scenarios of cell fate determination after mitotic
arrest [34]. Inhibition of transcription during mitotic arrest
mediated by PPP might explain the reduced levels of the
major microtubule-associated protein Tau in PPP-treated

A549 xenografts observed in the present study (data
not shown). This notion is corroborated by the fact that
reduction in Tau was not observed in normal lung tissue
from the same mice, because lung tissue is quiescent.
Furthermore, mitotic arrest occurred within minutes in the
A549 cell line but Tau reduction was observed in the same
cell line after 16 h.
It was recently reported that exposure to PPP,
at a very high concentration (i.e. 10 µM), has an effect
on microtubules, leading to blurry tubular staining in
micrographs taken after 24 or 48 hours [35]. The authors
suggested that this effect is due to PPP binding weakly to
b-tubulin at the same location as colchicine and the PPP
diastereomer podophyllotoxin (PPT). However, binding
competition studies using tritiated colchicine as the tracer
have previously shown that PPP does not compete with
colchicine, in contrast to PPT [36]. This experiment was
extended in the current study, measuring displacement
of tritiated colchicine, PPP, or PPT, by the unlabeled
compounds. In agreement with previous data colchicine
and PPT competed for binding to b-tubulin, whereas PPP
did not. Furthermore, in the third part of the experiment
no specific binding of tritiated PPP to b-tubulin could be
established.
Centrosome separation and the formation of a
bipolar mitotic spindle requires controlled changes in
microtubule dynamics [37]. These processes depend on
the activities of Aurora A kinase and its downstream target
Plk1, which has prompted interest in their function as anticancer targets [38]. However, the present study showed
that Plk1 activity remained high after addition of PPP,
indicating that PPP does not function through Plk1. The
study also showed that PPP does not function through
inhibition of the motor protein Eg5, needed for centrosome
separation [31].
To investigate whether PPP could induce rapid

effects on the microtubule system in other cancer cells
in interphase immunofluorescence microscopy was used,
and we could only detect weak depolymerizing effects in
comparison to a very low dose of the microtubule inhibitor
colchicine that induced drastic depolymerisation of the
microtubule system. This together with previous results
indicated that PPP has only a very weak microtubule
inhibitor activity in this experimental setting.
A number of microtubule inhibitors are presently
used in clinical oncology. They have severe adverse
effects including bone marrow depression, gastrointestinal
and neurological disturbances [39]. In contrast, PPP
has been shown to be well tolerated in patients despite
administration twice daily for weeks and months, with
reversible neutropenia as the only dose-related and
dose-limiting toxicity [11]. The chief limitation of
microtubule-targeted agents is the high rate of neuropathy
induced by these agents [40]. The gastrointestinal side
effects of microtubule-inhibiting drugs, i.e. diarrhea,
melena and paralytic ileus, are probably explained by
the high proliferative activity in the intestinal mucosa.
No drug-related, clinically important gastrointestinal
or neurological events have been reported after oral
administration of PPP in the clinic [11, 12]. These early
clinical data indicate that PPP does not show the typical
side effects of general microtubule inhibitors thus
suggesting that PPP might affect microtubule dynamics
in a different manner than currently available drugs.
Microtubule dynamics is spatially highly regulated
in mitosis [26, 37], and it is possible that PPP affects
proteins that regulate this process. Furthermore, binding
to polymerized or modified forms of b-tubulin found in the
cellular context cannot be ruled out.
In the present study PPP treatment resulted in
prominent CDK1 activation with increased levels of
Cyclin B1 protein and mRNA, increased Cyclin B1 in
complex with CDK1, and CDK1Thr161 phosphorylation in
cancer cell lines or tumors. PPP did not seem to directly
target CDK1 and the activation of CDK1 by PPP in cell
lines occurred the earliest after 2-4 h incubation, while
the interference with tubulin and spindle formation
occurred after minutes of PPP addition. Therefore, the
CDK1 activation induced by PPP may be a consequence
of its effect on mitosis. Other compounds affecting the
microtubules have been shown to induce similar effects
[41, 42]. PPP did not induce G2/M arrest or CDK1
activation in normal human hepatocytes (nHeps) or in
normal lung tissue from xenografted mice. This may
be explained by the fact that nHeps and cells in lung
tissue are quiescent and do not enter mitosis [43]. In
agreement, we further investigated the effect of PPP on the
proliferating normal human fibroblast cell line GM2808.
We observed a 1.5-fold increase in the percentage of cells
in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle after 24 h treatment
with the same dose of PPP (data not shown). This supports
the fact that PPP selectively eliminates proliferating cells,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

which is relevant for cancer therapy, aiming to target the
proliferating cancer cell that invades and metastasizes
[44].
In the present study PPP induced statistically
significant apoptosis only in HepG2 and MCF-7 cell lines
and not in Hep3B or Huh7 cells. This was accompanied
with a reduction in Mcl-1. The reduced Mcl-1 levels
may be due to its degradation by CDK1 phosphorylation
because CDK1 knockdown using siRNA rescued these
effects. This is in agreement with previous results [24].
HepG2 and MCF-7 cell lines have wild type p53, whereas
Hep3B lacks p53 and Huh7 harbors mutated p53 [45].
During PPP-induced mitotic arrest, mitotic inhibition of
transcription may cause the level of Mdm2 mRNA and
other short-lived mRNAs to decrease rapidly. Subsequent
loss of Mdm2 results in stabilization of p53 in cell lines
having wild type p53. Furthermore, due to more long-lived
p53 mRNA synthesis may continue for some time after a
block in transcription, causing p53-dependent apoptosis
(reviewed in [34]). A recent study supports that the p53status may explain the sensitivity to PPP [46].
In conclusion, our results demonstrate a novel
mechanism of action of the anticancer agent PPP,
interfering with microtubule dynamics and leading to
mitotic arrest. The effect is observed within minutes,
and is not caused by direct effects of PPP on b-tubulin,
CyclinB/CDK1, Aurora A, Plk1, Eg5. We suggest that the
microtubule effect is mechanistically separate from the
widely reported effects on IGF-1R pathway. It is likely
that the ability to cause mitotic arrest of tumor cells is an
essential component of the anti-tumor efficacy of PPP,
since this may lead to mitotic catastrophe and subsequent
cell death.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
HepG2 cell line (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany)
was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Paisley, UK)
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan,
UT), whereas Hep3B (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and
Huh7 (Professor M. Ingelman-Sundberg, Karolinska
Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden) were cultured in DMEM
(Gibco) with 10% FBS. As a normal counterpart to
these hepatoma cell lines, human hepatocytes (nHep)
(Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) were used and maintained
in hepatocyte basal medium supplemented with the
HCM™ bullet kit®  (Lonza). A549, MCF-7 (Professor K.
Wiman, Karolinska Institutet), igf1r-/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (R-MEF), IGF-1R-overexpressing (R+MEF)
(Professor R. Baserga, Thomas Jefferson University,
PA) and U2OS expressing green fluorescent protein
(GFP)-Histone H2B (J. Raaijmakers and R. Medema,

Oncotarget

Dutch Cancer Institute, the Netherlands) were cultured
in DMEM with 10% or 6% FBS (U2OS). All cell lines
were maintained in complete medium with penicillin
(100 units/ml), streptomycin (50µg/ml) (Hyclone, Logan,
UT) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
CO2 and confirmed authentic using Short Tandem Repeat
kit AmpFSTR identifier (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). PPP and picropodophyllotoxin (PPT) were
synthesized as described [3], and similar to colchicine,
nocodazole, MG-132 (Sigma, St Louis, MO), S-Trityl-LCysteine (STLC) (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO) and
BI 2536 (Selleckchem, Houston, TX) were dissolved in
dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO).

immediately performed using FACS Calibur.

siRNA knockdown of IGF-1R and CDK1
IGF-1Rand
mock-siRNA
(Thermo
Fisher  Scientific, Waltham, MA) were transfected
into Hep3B cells at 40% confluence by adding 8 μL
Dharmafect 4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 40 nmol
siRNA to 2 mL antibiotic-free medium. CDK1- and
mock-siRNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were transfected
into MCF-7 cells by adding 12 μL of oligofectamine
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 10 nmol of siRNA to 2
mL antibiotic-free medium. After 48 h (IGF-1R siRNA)
or 72 h (CDK1 siRNA) the cells were washed with fresh
medium and then treated with PPP or vehicle for an
additional 24 h before analysis. The knockdown efficiency
was 80-90% as assessed by Western blotting.

A549 xenograft model
A549 cells (2x106) in sterile phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) were injected subcutaneously in the ﬂanks
of 5-6 week-old immunodeﬁcient, female nu/nu Balb/c
mice. After 50 days, mice were treated using an oral
gavage with either PPP (40 mg/kg) or vehicle (7.5 mL/kg)
at 0, 12 and 24 h with daily monitoring of tumor growth
using a vernier caliper. At 3 h after the last treatment,
animals were sacrificed, tumor weights and volumes
determined and tumor and lung tissues were collected,
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Animal
experiments were performed by ProQinase (Freiburg,
Germany) according to the guidelines of the Federation
for Laboratory Animal Science Associations, EU.

Western blotting
Cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mM
Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA,
0.25% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease
(Roche) and phosphatase (Sigma) inhibitors. Lysates
were centrifuged at 16,100 x g at 4ºC for 30 min and
supernatants stored at -80ºC. Protein concentrations were
determined using BCA (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford,
IL) and equal amounts of protein were resolved on 4-12%
gradient- or 12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen),
transferred to nitrocellulose Hybond membranes
(Amersham,  Buckinghamshire, UK), blocked with 5%
dry milk or BSA in 20 mM Tris base, 135 mM NaCl,
0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and blotted against rabbit anticaspase3 #9662, rabbit anti-CDK1pT161 #9114, rabbit antiCDK1pY15 #9111, mouse anti-Cyclin B1 #4135, and rabbit
anti-Mcl-1 #5453 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA) or rabbit anti-GAPDH sc-25778 antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or mouse
anti-PARP #556363 (Becton Dickinson) or rabbit antiCDK1 #PC25 antibody (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA).
Membranes were routinely washed using TBST, and
incubated with secondary anti-rabbit/mouse/goat IgG
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies NA934,
NA931 (Amersham) or 31402 (Pierce Biotechnology)
followed by signal detection using enhanced luminescence
Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham) and quantification using
imageJ.

Analysis of cell growth, cell cycle distribution and
apoptosis
Cell viability was determined with the alamarBlue®
assay (Invitrogen) as described in [47]. Cell cycle phase
distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry using
propidium iodide (PI) as described in [14]. For M-phase
quantification, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol,
permeabilized using 0.25% TritonX-100, incubated
with anti-phospho-histone H3 (pH3) antibody 06-570
(Millipore, Temecula, CA) for 1 h at room temperature
(RT), washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated antibody A11029 (Invitrogen) and
PI. Following analysis with flow cytometry, the data
were processed with the Cell Quest software (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA) or ModFit Software (Verity
Software, Topsham, ME). For the analysis of cell cycle
phase distribution of cells from tumor and lung tissue
of A549 xenografts, the formalin-protease method was
adopted as described [48], followed by quantification
using ModFit Software. Apoptosis was studied using
Annexin V/PI method (Annexin V-FLUOS staining
kit, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Flow cytometric analysis was

CDK1 kinase assay
Cells/tumor tissue were lysed in PBS pH 7.0
containing 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT,
2 mM NaF, 0.2% Triton-X 100, protease/phosphatase
inhibitors [47] and processed as described above. CDK1

was immunoprecipitated using mouse anti-CDK1 agaroseconjugated antibody sc-54 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
followed by washing and re-suspension in kinase buffer
with 10 mM DTT and 20-50 µM unlabeled ATP. After
addition of 1.5 g histone H1 (Roche) and 5-10 µCi γ-32P
(Perkin Elmer, Rodgau, Germany), the samples were
incubated for 30 min at 30˚C with termination by 4 x SDSPAGE sample buffer followed by electrophoresis on 12%
polyacrylamide gel with final analysis/quantification by
autoradiography/densitometry [47].

expressing both mCherry-a-tubulin and GFP-Histone
H2B, Z-stacks with a spacing of 1 µm were acquired
and are represented as maximum intensity projections.
mCherry-a-tubulin association to the mitotic spindle was
measured by taking the maximum mCherry intensity of the
cell, whereas the diffusible pool of mCherry-a-tubulin was
assessed by measuring the average mCherry fluorescence
in an area of the cell where no visible spindle structure is
present. Inverted fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET) ratios of a Plk1-responsive probe [30] were
monitored and analyzed as described [49].

RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR

Tubulin-binding assay

Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit
(Qiagen) and stored at -80°C until use. The concentration
and the quality of isolated RNA were determined
using NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
Technologies, Wilmington, DE). cDNA was generated
from 2 µg of total RNA with Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied Biosystems) and the concentration determined as
above. Real-time RT-PCR was carried out (10 min 95ºC,
40 cycles 15 s 95ºC, 1 min 60ºC) using the ABI 7500
probes for cyclin B1 (Hs00259126_m1) and GAPDH
(Hs02758991_g1), each having the fluorochrome FAM
conjugated at the 5’ end (Applied Biosystems).

Binding of PPP and PPT (both from the Biovitrum
compound collection) and colchicine (Sigma C-9754)
were performed using Colchicine site competitive assay
kit Cytodynamix Screen 15 (Cytoskeleton, CDS15),
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. In separate
experiments [3H]-Colchicine (American Radiolabeled
Chemicals, ART-722), [3H]-PPP (Biovitrum) or [3H]PPT (Biovitrum) were used as tracers, having specific
activities of approximately 3145, 670, and 670 GBq/
mmol, respectively. The concentration of [3H]-colchicine
in the assay was 53 nM, and the concentration of [3H]PPP or [3H]-PPT was 4-fold higher, due to lower specific
activity, keeping within the limit of the kit procedure as
stated by the manufacturer. Compound stock solutions
were 10mM in DMSO, and serial dilutions 1:3 were
made in DMSO prior to transfer to the assay plate. Top
concentration of compound dilution in the assay was 42
µM. Serial dilutions were made in duplicates. Briefly, 10
µL of compound dilution and 10 µL of tracer dilution were
incubated with 180 µL of tubulin-biotin SPA-beads for 45
minutes at 37 ˚C after a short initial shake. Readings were
done using a 1450 MicroBeta Trilux 32 BI. Data were
analysed using Xlfit 4 parametric linear regression model
205.

Immunofluorescence analysis of tubulin and
phosphohistone H3 (pH3)
The cells, seeded on coverslips, were fixed in 4%
buffered paraformaldehyde solution, permeabilised using
0.1% TritonX-100, incubated overnight with rabbit antipH3 antibody 04-817 (Millipore), washed with PBS
containing 5 mM EGTA and incubated with goat antirabbit Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated antibody A11012
(Invitrogen) for 1 h at RT. For subsequent staining of
tubulin, cells were washed with PBS-EGTA, incubated
with mouse anti-tubulin antibody T5168 (Sigma) for
1 h at RT, washed with PBS-EGTA and incubated with
goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody
A11029 (Invitrogen). For counterstaining of cell
nuclei, the coverslips were mounted using Vectashield
mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA). Cells were examined using an Axioplan
2 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05 based
on two-sided Student’s t-test.
