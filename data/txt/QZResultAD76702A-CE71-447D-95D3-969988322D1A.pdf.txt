ABSTRACT
Acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), such as gefitinib, remains a major problem in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. Increased activation of AXL has been identified
as a novel mechanism for acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC treatment.
However, the cause of uncontrolled AXL expression is not fully understood. Here, we
first demonstrate that AXL is overexpressed in an acquired gefitinib-resistant cell
line (H292-Gef) as a result of slow turnover and that AXL is degraded by presenilindependent regulated intramembrane proteolysis (PS-RIP). Based on the findings,
we attempted to enhance AXL degradation to overcome acquired gefitinib-resistance
by the treatment of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells with yuanhuadine (YD), a potent
antitumor agent in NSCLC. Treatment with YD effectively suppressed the cancer cell
survival in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, YD accelerated the turnover of AXL by
PS-RIP and resulted in the down-regulation of the full-length AXL. Therefore, the
modulation of the proteolytic process through degradation of overexpressed AXL
may be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NSCLC and EGFR-TKIresistant NSCLC.

fibronectin type III repeats in the extracellular region, which
lead to the interaction of cells with neighboring cells, and
a cytoplasmic kinase domain [8, 9]. The ligand for AXL is
growth-arrest-specific 6 (Gas6). AXL signaling is associated
with cell survival, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and
anti-apoptosis [10, 11]. The activation of AXL may also
consequently affect the downstream phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) and mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways [12–14].
Down-regulation of the aberrantly activated RTK is
an essential strategy for the suppression of tumor growth.
The levels of some RTKs, such as MET and insulinlike growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R), are regulated
by presenilin-dependent regulated intramembrane
proteolysis (PS-RIP)-associated degradation, a proteo­
lytic process that consists of two sequential steps
[15, 16]. The first step is an ectodomain shedding, which
is attributed to matrix metalloproteases (MMP) and a
disintegrins and metalloproteases (ADAM), and releases

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the
leading causes of cancer-associated death, accounting for
approximately 80–85% of all lung cancers [1, 2]. The
occurrence of drug resistance in tumor cells has been a
major barrier in anti-cancer chemotherapies. Similarly,
acquired resistance has been observed in NSCLC patients
treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) who initially showed an
excellent response to the treatment [3]. Several resis­
tance mechanisms, such as secondary mutations, MET
amplification, and activation of other receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) have provided a variety of different
therapeutic approaches [4, 5].
Recent studies have reported that the overexpression
of AXL correlates with resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC
[6, 7]. AXL is a member of the TAM RTK family, which
includes Tyro-3, AXL and MER. The TAM receptors are
composed of two immunoglobulin-like domains and dual

the extracellular domains into the cultured media [17,
18]. The second step is an intramembrane cleavage
by the γ-secretase complex, which includes anterior
pharynx-defective 1, nicastrin, presenilin enhancer 2 and
presenilin 1–2 (PSEN1–2). Therefore, an extracellular
soluble N-terminal fragment (NTF), an intermediate
membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment (CTF) and
an intracellular domain (ICD) are generated by PS-RIP.
ICD and NTF can contribute to the down-regulation of
receptor signaling by ICD degradation, and NTF acts as
a ligand decoy to inhibit the activation of the remaining
membrane-anchored receptor [15].
Despite many reports on activation of AXL in
drug-resistance, the cause of AXL overexpression has
been poorly discussed. In this study, we present that
PS-RIP is involved in the degradation of AXL, and
this process may be impaired in AXL-overexpressing
gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we
applied yuanhuadine (YD), an antitumor agent [19], to
confirm the effect of enhancing AXL degradation on
cancer cell proliferation. Thus, we suggest that targeting
the proteolytic degradation of AXL is an attractive
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NSCLC and
EFGR-TKI-resistant NSCLC.

AXL is up-regulated in gefitinib-resistant
cell lines
The identification of the causes of drug resistance
in anti-cancer chemotherapies is important for the
restoration of drug sensitivity. Recent reports suggest that
the activation of AXL is in part associated with EGFRTKI-resistant NSCLC [6, 7]. Therefore, we assessed
the correlation between AXL expression and gefitinib,
an EGFR-TKI, sensitivity. We first evaluated the IC50
values of gefitinib in six NSCLC cell lines (Figure 1A and
Supplementary Figure 1). Six cell lines were treated with
various concentrations of gefitinib ranging from 1.3 nM
to 200 μM for 72 h. The growth inhibitory activity
was determined by measuring the protein contents of
cells using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Calu1 and H1299 cells were resistant to gefitinib (IC50 >
10 μM), and A549 cells were regarded as intermediatesensitive to gefitinib (IC50 = 7.8 μM). H292, H358 and
H1993 cells were sensitive to gefitinib with the IC50 values
of less than 1 μM. To examine whether the difference in
the gefitinib sensitivity of the three groups of cell lines is

was then determined by SRB assay. The IC50 values were calculated using the TableCurve 2D software, and are shown in parentheses.

the degradation of AXL, we inhibited the two sequential
steps of PS-RIP with the broad-spectrum metalloprotease
inhibitor GM6001 and γ-secretase inhibitor compound E
(Figure 2E). GM6001 suppressed the initial ectodomain
shedding activity in H292-Gef cells; hence, the level of fulllength AXL was increased and NTF in the cultured media
disappeared. Moreover, the generation of an intermediate
membrane-anchored CTF and its further cleavage by the
γ-secretase complex to release an ICD (~52 kDa), which
is stabilized by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132, was
inhibited. Furthermore, the inhibition of γ-secretase by
compound E also resulted in the disappearance of ICD. In
contrast, the CTF remained uncleaved and accumulated in
the cells, and NTF was still detected in the cultured media.
Co-treatment with GM6001 and compound E increased the
full-length AXL, whereas NTF and ICD were not detected.
A slight level of CTF was detected, which may have formed
before the cells were affected by the inhibitors. We observed
similar findings after the inhibitor treatments in H292 cells
(Supplementary Figure 2). Taken together, the up-regulation
of AXL in H292-Gef cells may be partly associated with
a decrease in the degradation rate of AXL, which appears
to be regulated through PS-RIP. Thus, the degradation
mechanism of AXL could be a potent target for overcoming
gefitinib-acquired resistance in cancer cells.

related to the expression of AXL, we evaluated the AXL
expression levels in these six cell lines. The AXL protein
levels were considerably high in Calu-1 and H1299 cells,
but the AXL protein was barely detected in the remaining
four cell lines (Figure 1B). The AXL gene levels in the
two gefitinib-resistant cells were 7- to 10-fold higher
than those observed in A549 cells (Figure 1C). Although
H292 cells exhibited a higher expression level of the AXL
gene compared with A549 cells, the AXL gene levels in
the gefitinib-sensitive cell lines were fairly low relative
to those observed in the gefitinib-resistant cell lines.
Therefore, it implies that there is a correlation between high
AXL expression and gefitinib-resistance in NSCLC cells,
whereas no correlation was found between AXL expression
and gefitinib sensitivity in the gefitinib-sensitive cells.

Degradation of AXL is suppressed in acquired
gefitinib-resistant cells
To further investigate the status of AXL in acquired
gefitinib-resistance, we established a gefitinib-resistant
cell line, H292-Gef, through the continuous exposure of
the parental-drug-sensitive H292 cells to gefitinib. H292Gef cells exhibited an approximately 500-fold greater
resistance to gefitinib than did the parental cells (IC50
value of gefitinib = 2.3 × 10-2 μM in H292 cells; IC50 value
of gefitinib = 11.6 μM in H292-Gef cells, Figure 2A).
Consistent with the findings in the gefitinib-resistant
NSCLC cell lines, the AXL expression was markedly
up-regulated in H292-Gef cells compared with H292
cells (Figure 2B). Based on the finding, we attempted to
elucidate the cause of the higher AXL level in H292-Gef
cells. We first determined the degradation of AXL over
time by measuring AXL expression in H292 and H292-Gef
cells after treatment with cycloheximide (CHX), a protein
synthesis inhibitor (Figure 2C, left panel). The half-life
of AXL was approximately 3 h in H292 cells and 16 h
in H292-Gef cells (Figure 2C, right panel). Accordingly,
we assumed that the degradation of AXL was suppressed
in H292-Gef cells compared with H292 cells, and this
event may be highly associated with gefitinib-acquired
resistance in NSCLC cells. We then further elucidated the
mechanism of AXL degradation in H292-Gef cells.
One of the mechanisms that regulate the degradation
of RTK involves PS-RIP [15, 16]. Therefore, we evaluated
the levels of key biomarkers in PS-RIP, namely ADAM10,
ADAM17, PSEN1 and PSEN2, in both H292 and H292Gef cells. The levels of ADAM10 and ADAM17, which
are ADAM family members, were assessed to reflect the
ectodomain shedding capacity of the cells. PSEN1 and
PSEN2, the catalytic subunits of γ-secretase complex, were
measured as representatives of γ-secretase activity because
they are known to be essential for the proteolytic activity of
the enzyme. As shown in Figure 2D, all of these biomarkers
were expressed at lower levels in H292-Gef cells than in
H292 cells. To further verify that PS-RIP is involved in

Antitumor agent diminishes the full-length AXL
We assumed that the degradation of AXL should be
processed as described in Figure 3A. Overexpressed AXL
could be removed from the cell membrane by increasing
the cleavage of extracellular and intracellular domain of
AXL. Moreover, the generated ICD could be removed
through proteasomal degradation. Therefore, to confirm
our hypothesis and explore the potential to inhibit cell
proliferation by regulating the degradation of AXL, we
applied YD, a natural product-derived antitumor agent
[19, 20], to H292 and H292-Gef cells. YD effectively
suppressed the proliferation of these two cell lines with IC50
values of 0.1 nM in H292 cells and 4.3 nM in H292-Gef
cells (72 h; Figure 3B). The alterations in AXL expression
was then monitored for up to 6 h after treatment with
10 nM YD (Figure 3C). The level of full-length AXL
was decreased time-dependently in H292 and H292-Gef
cells. The decrease of AXL level was first detected at 2 h
in H292 cells and 3 h in H292-Gef cells after exposure to
YD. We further determined the effect of YD on the halflife of AXL. After treatment with YD and CHX, the AXL
expression was detected in H292 and H292-Gef cells
(Figure 3D, upper panel). In both cell lines, the half-life
of AXL was observed between 0.5 and 1 h, which was
faster than the half-life measured in Figure 2C (Figure 3D,
lower panel). Moreover, treatment with YD for 3 h
suppressed phosphorylated AKT (Ser473), one of the key
molecules of AXL downstream signaling pathway, in both
H292 and H292-Gef cells (Figure 3E). Consistent with the

Increased formation of AXL-NTF triggers
subsequent intracellular cleavage

findings shown in Figure 3C, we observed the decrease
of AXL expression in the cells treated with YD for 24 h
by immunocytochemistry (Figure 3F). The action of YD
targeted on the expression of AXL rather than the kinase
activity of AXL, as an AXL kinase activity assay confirmed
that YD has no effect on the kinase activity (Supplementary
Figure 3). Collectively, YD effectively decreases the fulllength AXL and shortens the half-life of AXL. These events
consequently inhibit the growth of cancer cells by downregulating the AXL downstream signaling pathway.

Based on the findings that YD generates the CTF
and ICD of AXL, we further investigated whether the
degradation of full-length AXL by YD is associated with
PS-RIP process. Without initial ectodomain removal in PSRIP, full-length RTK is hardly cleaved by the γ-secretase
complex [21]. Accordingly, we evaluated whether YD
produces soluble AXL, the NTF of AXL, in addition to
the CTF and ICD of AXL. After treatment of H292 and
H292-Gef cells with YD for 3 h, immunoprecipitation
was performed with culture media using antibody against
N-terminal AXL. We detected the elevated NTF of AXL
in the culture supernatant of the YD-treated groups and a
reduction of full-length AXL in the cell lysates (Figure 6A).
In addition, cells pre-treated with metalloprotease inhibitor
GM6001 for overnight were treated with YD to determine
whether the ectodomain cleavage of AXL induced by YD is
metalloprotease-dependent. As shown in Figure 6A, despite
the inhibition of metalloproteases, YD treatment produced
AXL-NTF in the culture media. To determine the order of
NTF and ICD generation, the formation of fragments in
H292-Gef cells was monitored by time-course treatment
with YD. MG132 was co-treated for the detection of
AXL-ICD. After 0.5 h treatment with YD, AXL-NTF was
observed in the culture media and only CTF was weakly
detected in the cell lysates (Figure 6B). AXL-ICD appeared
in the cell lysates after 1 h treatment with YD and the
fragment level was increased time-dependently. To evaluate
whether the interruption of metalloproteases affects the
production of AXL-CTF and –ICD by YD, we incubated
the cells overnight with GM6001 and then treated them
with YD and/or MG132. The increase of ICD and the
decrease of full-length AXL in the cells co-treated with YD
and MG132 were not reversed by GM6001 pretreatment
(Figure 6C). However, the cells co-treated with GM6001
and MG132 failed to release the CTF and ICD, and
elevated the expression of full-length AXL. Collectively,
the results indicate that YD metalloprotease-independently
enhances the cleavage of the extracellular domain of
AXL and efficiently provides the AXL-CTF, which acts
as a substrate for the γ–secretase complex. Moreover, the
cleavage of AXL induced by YD occurs through the two
sequential steps of PS-RIP, the ectodomain shedding and
the intramembrane cleavage.
To further explore the significance of AXL in the
anti-proliferative activity of YD, H292-Gef cells were
transfected with AXL small interfering RNA (siRNA)
for 24 h, and the cell proliferation was then determined
after 48 h treatment with YD. AXL siRNA effectively
suppressed the protein expression of AXL in H292-Gef
cells (Figure 6D, left panel). AXL siRNA-transfected cells
were less sensitive to YD than were the non-transfected
and scrambled siRNA-transfected cells (Figure 6D, right
panel). In the presence of 40 nM YD, the cell proliferation

Antitumor agent enhances the γ-secretasemediated generation of AXL-ICD
We hypothesized that YD may accelerate the
degradation of AXL, resulting in the reduction of fulllength AXL expression. To further determine whether the
proteasomal or lysosomal degradation is involved in the
YD-induced decrease of AXL, we co-treated the cells with
YD and the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 or the lysosomal
inhibitor chloroquine (Figure 4A). Neither MG132 nor
chloroquine impaired the activity of YD on AXL in both
H292 and H292-Gef cells. However, the approximately
52-kDa fragment of AXL was visualized with antibody
against C-terminal AXL in the cells treated with YD and
MG132. In addition, to reconfirm that the generation of
the 52-kDa fragment was directed by the effect of YD, the
cells were co-treated with YD and the increasing doses
of MG132 (Figure 4B). The 52-kDa fragment was clearly
increased in the cells co-treated with YD and MG132
compared with the cells treated with MG132 alone, and a
weak band was also observed above the 52-kDa fragment.
However, the fragments were not visualized with the antiAXL N-terminal antibody (Supplementary Figure 4),
and this confirmed that the fragments observed consisted
of the C-terminal domain of AXL. Furthermore, the
cytosolic localization of the 52-kDa fragment in the cells
identified that the fragment is the AXL-ICD (Figures 4C
and 4D). Additionally, the fragment observed above the
52-kDa fragment was detected in the membrane fraction,
indicating that the fragment corresponds to the AXL-CTF.
We investigated whether γ-secretase is involved in
the generation of AXL-ICD by YD. After pretreatment
with compound E, the effect of YD on the release of
AXL-ICD was impaired and the CTF was accumulated,
whereas the full-length AXL was still decreased in both
H292 and H292-Gef cells (Figure 5A). As expected, the
AXL-ICD was not detected with anti-AXL N-terminal
antibody (Supplementary Figure 5). We then observed
the fate of the AXL-ICD produced by YD treatment. The
AXL-ICD was ubiquitinated after 3 h of treatment with
YD and MG132, the proteasomal inhibitor (Figure 5B).
Thus, the loss of AXL induced by YD in H292 and H292Gef cells results from the γ-secretase-mediated generation
of ICD, which is rapidly removed through proteasomal
degradation.

inhibitory effect on the growth of AXL overexpressing
gefitinib-resistant cells.

Antitumor agent suppresses tumor growth
and AXL expression in H292 and H292-Gef
cell-implanted xenografts

suggested that the activation of AXL is associated with
TKI-resistance in several cancers, such as gastrointestinal
stromal tumors, ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast
cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia [24–26]. We herein
found high expression of AXL in both acquired- and nonacquired gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells. Based on the
elevated AXL expression featured in H292-Gef cells, we
proceeded to elucidate the mechanism underlying how
AXL is overexpressed in drug-resistant cells. Primarily,
we found that the half-life of AXL protein was increased
in H292-Gef cells compared with the parent H292 cells.
This event suggests that the sustained higher level of
AXL protein in the acquired-gefitinib-resistant cells may
be associated with down-regulation of the degradation of
AXL in the cells. The levels of many RTKs are regulated
by a proteolytic cleavage process, such as PS-RIP [27].
AXL has been reported to undergo post-translational
processing by an unknown protease to release NTF
and CTF, an event that is augmented by phorbol ester
treatment [28]. We identified the constitutive release of the
AXL-NTF, CTF and ICD in H292 and H292-Gef cells.
We also found that inhibition of the two sequential steps
of PS-RIP interrupted the formation of the three fragments
of AXL, indicating that PS-RIP plays a role in AXL
regulation. Furthermore, the key markers of PS-RIP, such
as ADAM10, ADAM17, PSEN1, and PSEN2, are downregulated in H292-Gef cells. Thus, the mechanism of AXL
overexpression in acquired-gefitinib-resistant cells may be
dysregulation of PS-RIP, resulting in an elevation in the
half-life of the AXL receptor.
Accordingly, we speculated that the activation
of PS-RIP may be a potent therapeutic strategy for
regulating abnormal activation of AXL in NSCLC
cells. To validate this assumption, we applied YD, an
antitumor agent isolated from flowers of Daphne genkwa
that effectively inhibits the growth of gefitinib-resistant
NSCLC cells and that of A549 NSCLC xenograft tumors
[19]. YD accelerated the degradation rate of full-length
AXL and shortened the half-life of AXL compared with
its original half-life in H292 and H292-Gef cells. The
sequential generation of AXL-NTF and –ICD was induced
simultaneously with the decrease of full-length AXL by
YD. The inhibition of γ–secretase activity resulted in
the suppression of ICD formation and the accumulation
of CTF, indicating that YD suppresses AXL through
γ–secretase activity. Treatment with YD increased the
release of NTF into the culture medium, and co-treatment
with metalloprotease inhibitor failed to impair the downregulation of full-length AXL and the generation of
both NTF and ICD by YD. Therefore, metalloproteaseindependent induction of the initial step of PS-RIP, an
ectodomain shedding, by YD provides more substrates
for the second step, γ-secretase-associated cleavage.
Furthermore, AXL siRNA-transfected H292-Gef cells
were less sensitive to YD treatment, providing additional
evidence clarifying that YD affects the full-length AXL

We further evaluated the antitumor activity of YD
in nude mouse tumor xenograft models implanted with
H292 or H292-Gef cells. BALB/c-nude mice bearing
xenograft tumors were orally administered 1 mg/kg YD
or 50 mg/kg gefitinib once a day for 21–22 days (Figures
7A and 7B). Consistent with the in vitro result on the
sensitivity of H292 and H292-Gef cells to gefitinib, the
growth of H292 xenograft tumors was significantly
suppressed by treatment with gefitinib (87% tumor
growth inhibition, P = 0.002), but the growth of H292Gef xenograft tumors was barely inhibited (14% tumor
growth inhibition, P = 0.4). However, treatment with YD
efficiently inhibited tumor growth of H292 xenografts
by 54% (P = 0.01) and that of H292-Gef xenografts by
106% (P = 0.007, 16% tumor regression) at the end of
the study. The immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor
sections demonstrated the decreased expression of Ki-67,
a proliferation marker, in YD-treated groups (Figure 7C).
In gefitinib-treated groups, Ki-67 expression was only
decreased in H292 xenograft tumors. No overt toxicity
or change in body weight was observed in the treatment
groups (Supplementary Figures 6A and 6B).
To validate the findings associated with AXL
in tumor models, the expression of AXL in tumors
obtained from the in vivo study was also investigated by
immunohistochemistry. AXL levels were higher in the
H292-Gef tumors than was the H292 tumors, and were
remarkably suppressed by treatment with YD (Figure 7D).
The western blot analysis also confirmed that the expression
of full-length AXL was decreased in tumors of YD-treated
groups (Figure 7E). Thus, the results reveal that YD
effectively suppressed the growth of H292 and H292-Gef
xenograft tumors as well as the expression of AXL in these
tumor tissues.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report that the overexpression of
AXL in acquired gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cells arises
from the down-regulated degradation of the receptor. This
finding is meaningful because although the activation
of AXL has been suggested as a resistance mechanism
in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cells, but the fate or
turnover of the receptor has been poorly elucidated. We
also demonstrate that one of the degradation mechanisms
of AXL is associated with PS-RIP, and thus, enhancing
the degradation of AXL can effectively inhibit cell
proliferation and tumor growth in NSCLC and EGFRTKI-resistant NSCLC cells.
High expression of AXL has been observed in
various types of cancer patients and proposed as a poor
prognostic biomarker [22, 23]. A large body of evidence

into the flanks of BALB/c-nude mice. Dosing of YD (1 mg/kg body weight) or gefitinib (50 mg/kg body weight) was initiated when
the tumor volumes reached approximately 110 mm3. YD and gefitinib were administered orally once a day for 21 days. The tumor
volumes were measured on Days 0 and 8 and then every five days during the remaining period (n = 5 mice per group). The error bars
represent the means ± SD. (B) BALB/c-nude mice bearing H292-Gef tumors were orally treated with YD (1 mg/kg body weight)
or gefitinib (50 mg/kg body weight) once a day for 22 days. The treatment was initiated when the tumor sizes reached approximately
250 mm3. The tumor volumes were measured every 3–4 days (n = 5 mice per group). The error bars represent the means ± SD.
(C and D) Immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67 (C) and AXL (D) was performed using anti-Ki-67 antibody or anti-AXL antibody directed

(YD; purity > 98.5%) was isolated and identified from a
CHCl3-soluble fraction of the flowers of Daphne genkwa, as
described previously [19, 20]. Antibodies against C-terminal
AXL, ubiquitin and β-actin were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). N-terminal AXL
were purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK), and
p-AKT (Ser473), AKT and GAPDH were obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Female

protein. Although, YD did not inhibit the kinase activity
of AXL, the loss of AXL by YD efficiently suppressed
one of the key molecules of AXL downstream signaling,
such as AKT. In addition, the combination treatment with
gefitinib and YD synergistically inhibited the proliferation
of H292-Gef cells in vitro. YD also effectively suppressed
the growth of H292-Gef xenograft tumors and enhanced
the degradation of AXL in YD-treated xenograft tissues.
Because most ICDs generated from RTKs are labile,
the fragments are degraded in a proteasome-dependent
manner and consequently, the removal of kinase domain
results in the down-regulation of receptor signaling [29].
Nevertheless, some ICDs act as active fragments and regulate
gene transcription or the cellular survival/apoptosis balance
[30, 31]. In this study, however, the AXL-ICD generated
by YD is proteasome-dependently degraded. Therefore,
the produced ICD is rapidly cleared rather than involved in
regulating biological processes. The NTF released by PS-RIP
is known to function as a ligand decoy, which would prevent
the ligand from binding to RTK for signal transduction
[18, 32]. The NTF generated by YD treatment may also have
the potential to act as a ligand decoy for AXL. Although
further studies are needed to determine the precise cleavage
sites on AXL and the mechanism in which YD enhances the
action of PS-RIP, the findings suggest that the modulation
of AXL turnover may be a promising therapeutic target for
EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC cells.
In summary, we suggest that the overexpression
of AXL protein in an acquired-gefitinib-resistant cells is
caused by the down-regulation of its turnover. We also
demonstrated that PS-RIP is involved in the degradation
of AXL. Therefore, these findings present the targeting of
the AXL degradation mechanism as a novel therapeutic
strategy in EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC treatment.

Cell proliferation assay
The cells (5–8 x 104 cells/ml) were treated with
various concentrations of compounds in 96-well culture
plates. After 72 h of treatment, the cells were fixed
with 10% TCA solution, and the cell proliferation was
determined through a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay
[33]. The percentage of cell proliferation was determined
according to the following formula: cell proliferation (%)
= 100 × [(A treated – A zero day)/(A control – A zero day)], where A is
the average absorbance. The IC50 values were calculated
through non-linear regression analysis using TableCurve
2D v5.01 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA)

Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis
For western blot analysis, the cells were lysed
through boiling in 2× sample loading buffer (250 mM TrisHCl pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromophenol
blue, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM sodium fluoride, and
5 mM sodium orthovanadate) and further incubated for
5 min at 100°C. Equal amounts (10 or 50 μg) of protein
were subjected to 8–10% SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
The blots were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20
(TBST) for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated
with primary antibodies in 2.5% BSA in TBST overnight at
4°C. The membranes were washed three times with TBST,
and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies
diluted in 2.5% BSA in TBST for 2 h at room temperature.
After washing three times with TBST, the membranes were
exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solution
(Intron, Daejon, Korea). The blots were detected with an
LAS-4000 (Fuji Film Corp., Tokyo, Japan).
For immunoprecipitation of the cultured medium,
the cell supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter,
and the protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche
Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany) were then added.
For immunoprecipitation of the cultured cells, the cells
were lysed in IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% NP-40) containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The filtered cultured

Cell lines, reagents, antibodies and animals
The human lung carcinoma H1299, A549 and
H358 cells were provided by the Korean Cell Line Bank
(Seoul, Korea). The human lung carcinoma Calu-1, H292
and H1993 cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The cell lines
were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% FBS and antibiotics-antimycotics (PSF; 100 units/
mL penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and
250 ng/mL amphotericin B). The cells were incubated at
37°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Gefitinibresistant H292 cells (H292-Gef) were developed by our
group from the parental H292 cells through continuous
exposure to gradually increasing concentrations of gefitinib
(Selleckchem. Houston, TX, USA) and maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 μM gefitinib. MG132,

medium or equal amount of cell lysates was precleared
for 30 min at 4°C with protein G Sepharose 4FastFlow
(GE Healthcare, Little Chalfront, UK). After removal
of the beads (10 min, 12 000 rpm, 4°C), the supernatant
was incubated with the indicated antibody overnight at
4°C. The immunocomplex was collected with beads at
4°C for 2 h. The beads were washed four times with IP
lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with 2×
Laemmli sample buffer at 95°C for 10 min. The collected
protein samples were subjected to western blot analysis.

resulting supernatant was kept for analysis of the cytosolic
fraction, and the pellet was washed with lysis buffer
for membrane fraction extraction. The lysis buffer was
removed by centrifugation (20 min, 14 000 rpm, 4°C),
and the membrane pellet was once again washed with
ice-cold PBS. After removal of PBS (5 min, 14 000 rpm,
4°C), the membrane pellet was suspended in 1% NP-40
lysis buffer for 1 h on ice with mixing every 10 min. The
total, cytosolic and membrane lysates were boiled with 2×
Laemmli sample buffer at 95°C for 10 min.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

RNA interference

The total RNA from the cells were extracted with
TRI reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA),
and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a
Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, MA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Realtime PCR was conducted using iQTM SYBR® Green
Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The conditions for the
assay were the following: 20 sec at 95°C, 40 cycles of
20 sec at 95°C, 20 sec at 56°C, and 30 sec at 72°C, 1 min
at 95°C, and 1 min at 55°C. All of the experiments were
performed in triplicate, and the analysis was performed
through the comparative CT method using β-actin for
normalization. The sequences of the primers are listed in
the Supplementary Table 1.

RNA interference of AXL was performed using
25-bp siRNA duplexes purchased from Invitrogen. The
coding strand for AXL was as follows: sense CCA GCA
CCU GUG GUC AUC UUA CCU U and antisense
AAG GUA AGA UGA CCA CAG GUG CUG G. The
cells were transfected with 5 nM siRNA duplexes using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells transfected with a
control nonspecific siRNA duplex (Invitrogen) were used
as controls for direct comparison.

Analysis of drug combination
The cells were plated in 96-well culture plates and
then exposed to various concentrations of gefitinib and
YD (0.8 nM) in a ratio of 1:1. After 48 h incubation, the
cell proliferation was determined using the SRB assay.
The combination effect was evaluated by calculating the
combination index (CI) values as follows: CI = D1/(Dx)1
+ D2/(Dx)2, where D1 and D2 are the concentrations of the
combined test compounds that achieve the expected effect,
and (Dx)1 and (Dx)2 are the concentrations that achieve
similar effects when the test compounds are used alone. In
this study, 50% inhibition was taken as the effective level.
The CI values were compared to the reference values
reported by Chou [34].

Immunocytochemistry
The cells were grown on cover slips in dishes. After
treatment, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
(in PBS) for 15 min. The fixed cells were blocked
in permeabilizing conditions with 1% BSA (in PBS)
containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room
temperature. The cells were incubated with primary
antibody at 4°C overnight. Following the overnight
incubation, the cells were incubated with donkey anti-goat
secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 594 (Invitrogen)
for 2 h at room temperature. DAPI (0.5 μg/ml) was used to
counterstain the nuclei. The images were obtained using a
Zeiss ApoTome microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

In vivo tumor xenograft model
All animal use and care protocols followed the
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at Ewha Womans University and were approved
by the Korean Association of Laboratory Animal Care.
H292 or H292-Gef cells were injected subcutaneously
into the flanks of the mice (1 × 107 cells in 200 μl of
medium). When the tumor volume reached approximately
110 mm3 (H292) and 250 mm3 (H292-Gef), the mice were
randomized into the vehicle control and treatment groups
(n = 5). YD (1 mg/kg) or gefitinib (50 mg/kg) dissolved in
a volume of 200 μl of vehicle solution (Tween 80-ethanolH2O, 1:1:98) was administered orally once a day for 21 days
(H292) and 22 days (H292-Gef). The control group was
treated with an equal volume of vehicle. The tumor size was
measured using a digital slide caliper and volumes (mm3)

Cell fractionation
The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times
and then washed once rapidly with cold fractionation lysis
buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM
MgOAc, 5 mM KCl, 10 μM GTP, and protease inhibitor).
The scraped cells in lysis buffer were incubated on ice
for 10 min and then lysed by passing through a 27-gauge
needle 35 times on ice. Small amounts of the total lysate
samples were reserved from the lysates, and the remaining
samples were centrifuged (20 min, 2 000 rpm, 4°C). The
supernatant was then collected and centrifuged (30 min,
14 000 rpm, 4°C). After the second centrifugation, the
