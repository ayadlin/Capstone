ABSTRACT
The novel aminopeptidase potentiated alkylating agent melflufen, was evaluated
for activity in acute myeloid leukemia in a range of in vitro models, as well as in
a patient derived xenograft study. All tested AML cell lines were highly sensitive
to melflufen while melphalan was considerably less potent. In the HL-60 cell line
model, synergy was observed for the combination of melflufen and cytarabine, an
interaction that appeared sequence dependent with increased synergy when melflufen
was added before cytarabine. Also, in primary cultures of AML cells from patients
melflufen was highly active, while normal PBMC cultures appeared less sensitive,
indicating a 7-fold in vitro therapeutic index. Melphalan, on the other hand, was only
2-fold more potent in the AML patient samples compared with PBMCs. Melflufen was
equally active against non-malignant, immature CD34+ progenitor cells and a more
differentiated CD34+ derived cell population (GM14), whereas the stem cell like cells
were less sensitive to melphalan. Finally, melflufen treatment showed significant
anti-leukemia activity and increased survival in a patient derived xenograft of AML in
mice. In conclusion, melflufen demonstrates high and significant preclinical activity
in AML and further clinical evaluation seem warranted in this disease.

Melphalan flufenamide (melflufen, chemical name
L-melphalanyl-p-L-fluorophenylalanine ethyl ester
hydrochloride, previously designated J1) is a peptidasepotentiated alkylating agent (Supplementary Figure 1).
Under the action of aminopeptidases, like aminopeptidase
N [4], melflufen is hydrolyzed, leading to high
intracellular concentrations of alkylating moieties (e.g.
melphalan), able to interact with nucleic acids within the
tumor cells [5]. The ubiquitous enzyme Aminopeptidase
N (APN)/CD13 is an ectopeptidase involved in cellular
processes that contribute to uncontrolled cell growth,
invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, [6–9]. Increased
APN expression has been shown to be associated with a
malignant phenotype of several human cancers, including
AML [6, 10, 11].. In AML, APN is and is expressed on
stem cells and leukemic blasts [6, 10], on the cell surface
[11, 12] and in the cytoplasm [12], and recently occurrence
of APN was also demonstrated in microvesicles from

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive
blood malignancy originating from hematopoietic blast
cells in the bone marrow, with maturation arrest of the
myeloid cells resulting in hematopoietic insufficiency
such as cytopenia or anemia [1]. According to the Swedish
Acute Leukemia Registry, median age for adult AML
patients was 72 years in 2009 [2]. The cause of AML is
usually unknown, but 20% of all patients have a history
of a previous chronic bone marrow diseases, or prior
radiation or chemotherapy. AML progresses rapidly and
is fatal without specific therapy where complete remission
(CR) is required for long-term survival [3]. As for many
other malignant diseases combination chemotherapy (for
AML often an anthracycline and cytarabine) is needed to
maximize tumor-killing effect and reduce drug specific
toxicity.

patients with myeloid tumors [13]. Since APN mediates
cleavage of melflufen to its parental drug melphalan in
the tumor cell cytoplasm, or in environment with high
concentration of APN, a clinical usability of melflufen in
AML is suggested [4].
Melflufen is presently being investigated in a
successful phase I/IIa clinical trial in multiple myeloma
patients [14] and has also received an orphan drug
designation in the treatment of relapsed and refractory
multiple myeloma by EMA and FDA [15]. Since
melflufen has shown to be more active than melphalan in
various in vivo and in vitro models [5, 16–20], without
corresponding increase in toxicity, the therapeutic index
of melflufen appears to be superior to that of melphalan.
Melphalan is currently in clinical use in various standard
combination chemotherapy protocols, such as MP
(melphalan/prednisone) in multiple myeloma, or BEAM
(BCNU/etoposide/Ara-C/melphalan) in lymphomas, also
suggesting an important role for melflufen in combination
therapy.
Although AML survival has improved, in particular
among younger patients, the majority of patients still die
from the disease, and there is still need for new effective

drugs, single or in combination. Here we will characterize
the activity of melflufen in AML in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
AML cell lines
In the AML cell lines melflufen showed potent
cytotoxic activity (Figure 1A) with IC50-values ranging
from 0.018 to 0.17 µM (Table 1). Melphalan was
considerably less potent (Figure 1B) and the highest ratio
of IC50-values (melphalan/melflufen) was observed for the
FLT-3 mutated MV-4-11 cell line.

Combinations in AML cell lines
Volumes of synergy for melflufen combination
effects with either cytarabine or daunorubicin on the
inhibition of HL-60 cell line are shown in Figure 2.
The combination between melflufen and cytarabine
was shown to be highly synergistic when the drugs
were added simultaneously, whereas only subadditive interactions were observed for melflufen

Results presented in Figure 3 demonstrate that melflufen
and melphalan behave very differently, and while
melphalan’s activity appear almost insensitive to changes
in cell density but highly dependent on longer exposure,
it is clear that the effect of melflufen hits the cells very
rapidly if supported in excess.

cells from different diagnoses may detect tumor-type
specific activity. The mean cytotoxic activity of cytarabine
(n= 78), daunorubicin (n= 15), melflufen (n= 82) and
melphalan (n= 79) in 82 AML patient samples is shown in
Figure 4. Melflufen was the most cytotoxic drug tested in
patient cells with an average IC50 of 0.067 µM, followed

by daunorubicin with an IC50-value of 0.11 µM, while
cytarabine and melphalan had higher IC50 values of 3.2
µM and 5.5 µM respectively. The difference in cytotoxic
activity of melflufen and melphalan in patient AML
samples was high (82-fold, p<0.0001), in consistence with
the results obtained from the cell lines.

Figure 3: Time course for melflufen’s accumulation and cytotoxic effect in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells. The peptidase-

potentiated effect results in a rapid accumulation of the active drug, and with decreasing cell densities A-C-E. there are more drug molecules
per cell, and activity increases (curves shifts to the left). The rapid accumulation results in a competition for melflufen, and with high cell
densities (A) maximum effect is obtained already after 15 minutes, i.e. cells have taken up all melflufen from the medium. When the
cell number is lower (C and E) there is a time course for the accumulation, and longer exposure yields higher activity (i.e. lower IC50).
For melphalan the situation is completely different as the absorption of the drug is slow; longer exposure time results in higher activity
regardless if the cell density is high or low, suggesting rather slow absorption and a concentration equilibrium B-D-F.

There was a clear difference (p< 0.0001) of melflufen
activity between patients with a low/intermediate/highrisk genetic profile for all three groups, and the activity of
melflufen was higher (p< 0.0001) in patients succeeding
2-years survival (not shown). Although no significant
differences in melflufen activity were obtained for the
remaining stratification factors, there was a clear trend for
higher activity of melflufen in chemo-naïve patients, in
patients responding to subsequent therapy, debut and primary
AML. The activity (expressed as logIC50) of melflufen vs
melphalan weakly but significantly correlated (R2= 0.14,
p= 0.0029), as expected for alkylating agents. In addition
there was a slight but significant correlation vs doxorubicin
(R2= 0.097, p= 0.015), consistent with its ability to induce
DNA damage, but not vs amsacrine (R2= 0.00076, p= 0.85),
cytarabine (R2= 0.0053, p= 0.57), etoposide (R2= 0.027, p=
0.21), imatinib (R2= 0.047, p= 0.076) or vincristine (R2=
0.016, p= 0.35) (Supplementary Figure 2).
When the activity of melflufen in primary cultures
of AML cells obtained from patients was compared with
normal PBMCs (n= 10; Table 1 ), a 7.5-fold higher (i.e.
lower IC50) degree of cytotoxicity was observed in the
AML cultures. The corresponding difference in sensitivity
to melphalan was only 1.8-fold, indicating a more
favorable therapeutic index for melflufen.

with IC50-values of 1.9 and 0.68 µM, respectively. The IC50
ratio between melflufen and melphalan was 68 and 23 for
GM7 and GM14 cells, respectively.

Xenografts of patients derived tumor samples
The in vivo study with AML-ps xenograft showed
significant effects of melflufen regarding both leukemia
control and survival. The amounts of circulating HLAABC (eg leukemic) cells at day 30 after inoculation were
significantly (p<0.001) reduced vs control for all drugs,
the number of positive cells in the blood from melflufen
and melphalan treated mice was slightly lower (nonsignificant) than from cytarabine treated mice (Figure 5a).
Upon macroscopic evaluation, at euthanization on day
104, all mice treated with melflufen (16 mg/kg single dose)
were considered tumor free, with normal size organs, and in
the repeated melflufen group (8 mg/kg x 4), 7/9 mice were
considered tumor free, while two had splenic abnormalities
(Figure 5b). Only 3/10 mice treated with melphalan could
be considered tumor free (splenic abnormalities in 7).
All animals in the treatment groups lost weight
at some stage after treatment. The differences were not
significant, and the mean maximal weight loss was 11.4%
(day 6) in the cytarabine group, and 9.5% (day 9), 13.5
% (day 14), and 8.6% (day 14) in the melflufen single,
repeated and melphalan group, respectively (Figure 5c).
The median survival time (MST) of vehicle-treated
control animals was 34 days, and in the cytarabine (75
mg/kgx1 for five days during 2 weeks) group 49 days. In
contrast, all melflufen (16 mg/kg single dose and 8 mg/kg)
and melphalan (5 mg/kg) treated animals were still alive
at day 104 when the study was terminated as per protocol
(i.e. at 3x control MST; Figure 5d).

Myeloid progenitor cells
When melflufen was tested on immature CD34+
progenitor cells (FMCA-GM7) and a more differentiated
CD34+ derived cell population (FMCA-GM14) a very similar
sensitivity was observed with IC50-values of 0.028 and 0.029
µM, respectively, in contrast the stem cell like GM7 cells
were less sensitive to melphalan compared to GM14 cells

DISCUSSION

hematotological toxicity being dose-limiting. The estimated
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of melflufen in rodents was
close to that previously reported for melphalan (Data on file,
Oncopeptides AB Stockholm, Sweden, and [16]). Melflufen
is presently evaluated in phase II clinical trial for treatment
of multiple myeloma. Promising clinical results was recently
reported with 67 % of patients showing objective responses
(11 partial and 3 minor responses) in 21 patients (refractory
to iMIds and proteasome inhibitors) evaluable for efficacy.
Notably, clinically beneficial partial responses was observed
also in patients refractory to high dose melphalan [22]. Given
the strong indication of clinical activity in the ongoing phase
II study, it seems of outmost importance to identify other
potential target diagnoses for the clinical development of the
compound. In the present study we demonstrate significant
activity of melflufen in AML both in cell line models and
primary cultures of AML cells obtained from patients as well
as in PDX model of AML in vivo.
In the AML cell line panel the most sensitive was FLT3
mutated MV-4-11 cells. The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3
is predominantly expressed on pluripotent hematopoietic

The novel alkylating agent melflufen possess
significantly higher in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity
compared to melphalan despite similar alkylating capacity, i.e.
one bis-(chloroethyl)-amino unit per molecule. In vitro studies
have shown that melflufen is rapidly taken up into the cytosol
of tumor cells followed by intracellular hydrolysis resulting in
the subsequent release of alkylating moieties (e.g. melphalan),
reaching considerably higher concentrations compared to
direct treatment with melphalan [5]. This potentiation is
mediated by the action of aminopeptidases, including APN/
CD13, which is extensively expressed on leukemic blasts
in all AML subtypes [6, 10], but also on normal progenitor
and stem cells [21] and therefore hematotoxicity of APNtargeted drugs could be expected. It was recently shown that
monoclonal antibodies against APN could induce apoptosis
in AML cells independently of APN enzymatic activity [11],
which underlined APN as a possible drug target in AML
[8]. Preclinical safety studies of melflufen in rats and mice
show a toxicity profile common to alkylating agents with

cells and has a role in the regulation of proliferation and
differentiation [23, 24]. In AML FLT3 is commonly expressed
on leukemic blasts. Activating mutations of FLT3, including
FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT-ITD) are among the
most common genetic alterations in AML (approximately
30% of the patients), and FLT3-ITD positivity has been
associated with increased relapse rate and diminished overall
survival [25, 26]. Although MV-4-11 is often considered
as a chemosensitive cell line, it is encouraging to note that
melflufen is very active against cells displaying this mutation.
In this respect, it is also encouraging to note the high activity
of melflufen in primary cultures of AML cells from patients,
80-fold more potent than melphalan. In addition, melflufen
was six-fold more potent in the primary AML cultures
compared to normal PBMC cultures, indicating a more
beneficial in vitro therapeutic index. Melphalan on the other
hand was only two-fold more potent in AML compared to
PBMCs. It should be noted that both PBMCs and AML
samples proliferate poorly under the current assay conditions.
The high therapeutic index (AML vs PBMC) observed for
melflufen could potentially be related to APN expression
and activity in AML cells. It has been convincingly shown
that melflufen is a substrate for APN, yielding intracellular
melphalan as the hydrolysis product. It is therefore tempting
to speculate that the enzymatic reaction is preferentially
occurring in or at the proximity of APN overexpressing
AML blasts, thus leading to potentiated melflufen activity
in these cells. It is also worth noting that the IC50 obtained
in AML cells is well below clinically achievable plasma
concentrations, i.e. Cmax> 1 µM [27].
In patients with hematologic malignancies, allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using
reduced-intensity conditioning with regimens including
melphalan has been evaluated in clinical studies [28–30]. In
proliferating CD34+ progenitor cells, the melflufen IC50 was
comparable to that found in the low proliferating primary
AML cell cultures. The IC50 ratios between melflufen and
melphalan for stem cell like GM7 and differentiated GM14
cells were lower than that observed in primary AML cells.
It was interesting to note that melflufen was equally active
in the two normal cell models whereas the stem cell like
GM7 was less sensitive to melphalan. The limited longterm efficacy of many current AML therapies (i.e. high
frequency of relapse) has often been attributed to the inability
of standard chemotherapeutic agents to target AML stem/
progenitor cells. This activity of melflufen on the immature
(stem cell like) model might contribute to the superior clinical
activity over melphalan and could indicate a potential role
as a replacement of melphalan in stem cell transplantation
[28–30]. Interestingly, the side effect profile of intravenous
melflufen, including its myelotoxicity, observed in a clinical
phase I study, appeared similar to that of melphalan treatment,
both qualitatively and quantitatively [27].
In the present study, melflufen was also tested
in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin, two
cornerstone drugs in the treatment of de novo AML.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Synergy was observed for the melflufen-cytarabine
combination, whereas only subadditive interactions were
found for the melflufen-daunorubicin counterpart, when
investigated in AML cell lines. The observed synergy with
cytarabine is encouraging since this compound is often used
also after relapse, a therapeutic situation where melflufen
is likely to be evaluated. Interestingly the synergistic
interaction with cytarabine appeared to be sequence
dependent with increased synergy when melflufen was
added before cytarabine. A plausible explanation is that
melflufen may increase the proportion of cells in S-phase
during the first 24 (-48) hours after exposure, as recently
shown in lymphoma cell lines [31], which would increase
cytarabine potency. Conversely, cell cycle arrest induced by
cytarabine may affect the activity of other drugs used in
combination [32], but as an alkylator melflufen is not likely
cell cycle specific in its cytotoxicity. Results suggest that
melflufen may be further investigated in relapsed patients
using a timed sequential combination. In fact several prior
examples show that such an approach may be reasonable for
development of new AML therapies [33–35].
Finally melflufen induced significant activity in a
patient derived xenograft model of AML, and animals
treated with melflufen survived more than 3 times longer
than control animals, and when terminated at the end of
the experiment a majority of the melflufen treated animals
were without signs of residual leukemia (at macroscopical
examination). PDX models has been shown to reflect the
clinical situation with improved predictions of clinical
utility [36] which in combination with the in vitro results
makes melflufen a strong candidate for clinical evaluation.
In conclusion, melflufen demonstrates high and
significant preclinical activity in AML and further clinical
evaluation seem warranted in this disease

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs
Melflufen (kind gift from Oncopeptides AB,
Stockholm, Sweden) was dissolved in dimetylsulfoxid
(DMSO) and further diluted in sterile water or phosphate
buffered saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis,
Missouri, USA). For the patient derived xenograft (PDX)
model melphalan was obtained as Alkeran® were obtained
from the State-owned Pharmacy Chain (Apoteket AB,
Uppsala, Sweden), and for fluorometric microculture
cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) it was bought as a pure
chemical from Sigma Aldrich or as Alkeran®. All dilutions
with water/PBS were made immediately prior to the start
of the experiments to minimize the influence of compound
hydrolysis. The standard drugs amsacrin, cytarabine
(ara-c) daunorubicin, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine
(Sigma Aldrich) and imatinib (LC Laboratories, Woburn,
Massachusetts, USA) were dissolved in DMSO and

diluted in PBS or sterile water immediately prior to start
of the experiments.

These assays have been described in detail
previously [39]. Cryopreserved human umbilical cord
blood CD34+ progenitor cells were purchased from 3H
Biomedical AB (Cat no. 3H-902-10; Uppsala, Sweden).
After isolation, the CD34+ progenitor cells (92–95%
purity) were cryopreserved in −150 °C in fetal bovine
serum and DMSO. The cells were rapidly thawed in a
37 °C water bath and suspended in a cell thawing media
(3H Biomedical), centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min
and cultured in cytokine supplemented stem cell culture
medium for granulocytopoietic lineage differentiation,
including stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3),
Flt ligand (FL), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) (Cat. no. 900-30-50, 3HBiomedical),
at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Two types of assay setups were
performed to determine the drug sensitivity of the cells,
with drug treatment starting at different degrees of cell
differentiation. The cells were stimulated towards the
granulocyte-macrophage lineage in a 7-day assay (FMCAGM7), where cells were exposed to drugs day 0–7 of
differentiation and cell survival was analyzed with the
FMCA on day 7 [39]. In the 14-day assay (FMCA-GM14),
the cells were first cultured with stimulating cytokines in
a U-shaped 96-well microplate in absence of drugs. After
7 days of culturing the committed cells were resuspended,
plated in a 384-well microplate and exposed to drugs
during day 7–14 of differentiation with cell survival
analyzed on day 14 [39].

Cell lines
AML cell lines MV-4-11 (FLT3-ITD mutated),
HL60 (FLT3 wild type), Kasumi (translocation 8:21),
and KGI-A were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC; Wesel, Germany) and were cultured
in Dulbecco´s Modified Eagles medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (HI-FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (2% pest/glut;
Sigma-Aldrich). The cell lines were grown in 75 cm2
culture flasks (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide.
The cells were counted in a Bürker chamber and diluted
in cell culture medium to a concentration of 50 000 cell/
mL for use in the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity
assay (FMCA).

Patient samples
Leukemic cells ware obtained from 82 bone
marrow or peripheral samples in 73 patients (median age
54 yrs) with AML. The sampling was approved by the
Ethics committee of Uppsala University. As previously
described by Blom et al. [37], AML cells and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors
were isolated from bone marrow or peripheral blood by
1.007 g/ml histopaque (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala)
density gradient centrifugation. Cells were counted using
toluidine blue and resuspended in RPMI 1640 cell culture
medium, supplemented with 10% HI-FCS and 2% pest/
glut (all Sigma-Aldrich), to a concentration of 0.4 x 106
cells/mL for use in the FMCA. A proportion of ≥70%
viable blast cells were set as a prerequisite. Melflufen
was tested on all of the 82 samples, 79 of these was tested
against melphalan, 78 against cytarabine and 15 against
daunorubicin. Patient background information could
be extracted from the medical records for a majority of
the samples (67 of 82). The material was subsequently
grouped for the factors: prior chemotherapy (given
(n= 40)/not given (n= 19)) response to subsequent
chemotherapy (complete response (n= 22)/partial response
(n= 11)/progressive disease (n= 46)); patient survival after
sampling (<2 years (n= 50)/>2 year (n= 15)); genetic riskprofile according to the ELN-criteria [38] (high (n= 20)/
intermediate (n= 25)/low (n= 9)); disease status (debut
(n= 38)/relapse (n= 25)) and origin (de novo (n= 52)/
secondary AML (n= 6)). One-way ANOVA (for three
variables) or unpaired t-test (for two variables) was used
in Graph Pad Prism 5 Software Package (Graph Pad, San
Diego, California, USA) to determine differences in mean
logIC50.

assay (FMCA). The method is based on the fluorescence
generated from the hydrolysis of fluoresceindiacetate
(FDA) to fluorescein by cells with intact cell membranes,
previously described by Larsson et al. [40] and as a
protocol by Lindhagen et al. [41]. In short, 45 µL cell
suspension per well were seeded into drug containing
(5 µL/well) 384-well Nunc microtiter plates (Thermo
Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark). Or, 50 µL cell suspension
per well were seeded into a 384-well microtiter plates
(Nunc) and incubated for 24 hours (37°C, humidified
atmosphere, 5% CO2), after which 2.5 nl portions/well of
drug stock in anhydrous DMSO were added to the cells
using Echo 550 Liquid Handler (Labcyte, Dublin, Ireland).
The plates were thereafter incubated, without medium
change, in a humidified atmosphere, at 37°C, containing
95% air and 5% CO2 for 72 hours. Cells were washed once
with PBS, fluorescein diacetate (FDA; Sigma-Aldrich)
were added (50 µL, 10 µg/mL) and plates were incubated

facility and in-vivo procedures had the highest ethical
standards accredited by Association for Assessement and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC)
International. The environment and quality standards
were in compliance with International OECD principles
on GLP, although not audited by the internal Quality
Assurance staff. The antitumor activity of melflufen was
investigated in AML primary sample cells (AML-ps;
CD34+, CD33+, HLA-ABC*) transplanted female severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. The AML-ps
cells was obtained in SCID mice by injecting bone marrow
blasts from a 61 yo male patient in his third leukemic
relapse (FAB M1), CD13+, CD33+, CD34+, CD45+,
HLA ABC+, 46XY/49 XY, -8 -9 +11 +12 +21 +21 +21.
The maintenance of these characteristics was routinely
checked at the CRO facility.
Briefly, 5x106 AML-ps cells were injected i.v. in
SCID mice. After 2 days (preventive protocol) mice
were randomized in different experimental groups
(10-12 animals per group) and treatment started.
Vehicle, melflufen and melphalan were administrated
intravenously. A 5% glucose solution was used as
control and administered twice weekly (2QW x 2W).
Melflufen was dissolved in NN-dimethylamide (DMA)
to a concentration of 50 mg/mL, and within 30 minutes
prior to administration further diluted with 5% glucose
solution. Melflufen was either administrated as single
injection (16 mg/kg x 1), or twice a week for two weeks
(8 mg/kg, 2QW x 2W), doses were selected from previous
animal studies and were known to be tolerable in mice.
On a molar level 5 mg/kg of melphalan equals 8 mg/kg
of melflufen. Alkeran® (melphalan) was dissolved with
the accompanied solvent and further diluted with 5%
glucose solution within 30 minutes prior to administration,
schedule matched the melflufen repeated (5 mg/kg, 2QW
x 2W). Doses of melphalan (5 mg/kg x 4) and melflufen
(8 mg/kg x 4) were selected to be ‘equimolar’, i.e. to
deliver the same amounts of alkylating bis-(chloroethyl)
amino units to both groups for direct comparison of
activity. The insertion needle was rinsed with saline or
glucose prior to retraction to avoid local inflammatory
reactions. Cytarabine was used as a positive control, and
administered intraperitoneally (according to company
standard model) daily on weekdays (75 mg/kg, QDx5 x
2W).
Mice mortality, clinical signs and food consumption
were monitored daily, body weight was controlled every
3 days. Cytotoxic efficacy was evaluated in terms of
survival compared to control (glucose solution). Toxicity
was evaluated on the basis of the body weight reduction
and all organs were macroscopically examined upon
sacrifice. Leukemic mortality was the main endpoint, in
addition the total amount of circulating leukemia cells was
determined by flow cytometry (Fluorescence Activated
Cell Sorter; FACS) after inoculation of Human Leukocyte
Antigen (HLA)-ABC on day 30, and morphological

for 60 minutes before measurement of fluorescence
(485/538 nm for excitation and emission respectively) in a
FLUOstar Omega (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany).
The measured fluorescence is directly proportional to
the amount of viable cells with intact cell membrane.
Survival index (SI%) for each drug concentration was
calculated, expressed as percentage of test wells divided
by control cultures, with blank values subtracted. For
cell line assays, experiments were performed three times.
From the mean SI%-logConcentration curves the half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined
using non-linear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism.
To study the time course for melflufen and melphalan´s
accumulation in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells a set of
experiments with varying cell number (10-100 000 cell
/ mL) were performed in 96-well microtiter plates with
limited exposure times (i.e. adding a wash) before 72 hr
of total exposure.

Combinations
Melflufen in combination with standard AML-drugs
cytarabine and daunorubicin was investigated in the HL-60
(acute promyelocytic leukemia) cell line. The cytotoxicity
of the compounds were tested with the FMCA method
alone and in combinations in a 7x9 concentration matrix
using 384-well plates with 4 replicates per sample, in
two independent experiments. The concentrations ranges
were 0.0156-1, 0.004-1 and 0.0004-0.1 µM for melflufen,
cytarabine and daunorubicin, respectively. The effect
of the combinations was evaluated for concentrations
showing a percent inhibition (PI) between 30-76% with the
multiplicative method of Bliss which allows measurement
of antagonistic, additive, subadditive and synergistic
interactions of drug combinations [42]. The MacSynergy
II program (Prichard) was also used to analyze the whole
7x9 matrix according to the Bliss independence model
[42], where the effect of the combination is determined by
subtracting the experimental values from the theoretical
additive values for every combination in the matrix [43].
A three-dimensional differential surface plot demonstrates
synergy as peaks above a theoretical additive plane and
antagonism as depressions below it [43]. Volume above
the calculated additive plane (synergy) and log volume
was calculated. As suggested by Prichard et al. [44], such
data sets should be interpreted as follows: volumes of
synergy or antagonism at values of <25 are insignificant,
25–50-minor but significant, 50–100-moderate and
probably important in vivo, and >100-strong and likely to
be important in vivo.
