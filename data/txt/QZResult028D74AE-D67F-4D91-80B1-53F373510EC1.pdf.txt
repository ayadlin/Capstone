ABSTRACT
Betatrophin is a newly identified circulating adipokine playing a role in the
regulation of glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. But its role in metabolic
syndrome (MetS) remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to compare the circulating
betatrophin concentrations between patients with MetS and healthy controls. We
recruited 47 patients with MetS and 47 age and sex matched healthy controls.
Anthropometric and biochemical measurements were performed, and serum
betatrophin levels were detected by ELISA. Full-length betatrophin levels in patients
with MetS were significantly higher than those in controls (694.84 ± 365.51 pg/ml
versus 356.64 ± 287.92 pg/ml; P <0.001). While no significant difference of total
betatrophin levels was found between the two groups (1.20 ± 0.79 ng/ml versus
1.31 ± 1.08 ng/ml; P = 0.524). Full-length betatrophin level was positively correlated
with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (r = 0.357, P = 0.014) and 2-hour plasma glucose
(2hPG) (r = 0.38, P <0.01). Binary logistic regression models indicated that subjects
in the tertile of the highest full-length betatrophin level experienced higher odds of
having MetS (OR, 8.6; 95% CI 2.8-26.8; P <0.001). Our study showed that full-length
betatrophin concentrations were increased in drug-naïve MetS patients.

INTRODUCTION

Betatrophin, also known as lipasin, angiopoietinlike protein 8 (ANGPTL8) and refeeding induced fat and
liver (RIFL), is a newly identified circulating adipokine
predominantly synthesized in the liver and adipose
tissue [3-6]. Betatrophin was supposed to be a regulatory
mediator of glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism
in previous studies [7, 8]. Yi and colleagues showed that
betatrophin promotes beta cell proliferation and expansion
in insulin resistant mice [9]. However, several studies
failed to prove its anti-diabetic effect [10, 11]. Therefore,
controversy remains concerning the role of betatrophin
in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity [12-14].

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of multiple
metabolic disorders including abdominal obesity,
hypertension, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia [1].
The prevalence of MetS is increasing at alarming rates
threatening people’s health by placing them at a higher
risk of cardiovascular diseases, stroke and kidney diseases.
Although physical inactivity, overweight/obesity and
insulin resistance are definite risk factors for MetS [2], the
underlying causes remain inconclusive.

However, it is well accepted that betatrophin operates
as a blood lipid regulator by inhibiting lipoprotein lipase
activity either directly or indirectly through promoting
ANGPTL3 cleavage [3, 5, 8, 10].
Since the discovery of betatrophin has raised new
hope for therapeutic approaches or identification of a
potential biomarker for metabolic disorders, there is an
increasing interest in measurement of the circulating
level of betatrophin in humans. However, their results are
conflicting. Some studies reported increased circulating
betatrophin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) [15-20] and obesity [15, 21, 22], whereas others
found no difference [23, 24] or even a decrease [25] in
these metabolic disorders. Our previous meta-analysis has
shown that the association between circulating betatrophin
level and T2DM was diverse in different body mass
groups [26]. There are also many discrepancies in results
regarding the association between betatrophin and various
metabolic parameters related to metabolic diseases [15-25,
27, 28].
A recent prospective cohort study has demonstrated
that decreased levels of circulating betatrophin were
related to the development of MetS [29]. However, it
remains unknown whether betatrophin metabolism is

altered in patients with MetS, we aimed to evaluate the
circulating betatrophin levels in MetS patients in the
current study.

RESULTS
Characteristics of study participants
As shown in Figure 1, we identified 47 MetS
patients who met the inclusion criteria out of 1,245 cases
approached in the Outpatient Clinic, and 47 age and
sex matched healthy controls were recruited among 301
subjects approached in the Physical Examination Center
during the enrollment period. The baseline characteristics
of the two groups (MetS and healthy control) were
summarized in Table 1. Since participants were matched
for age and gender distribution, both were similar between
the two groups. There was no statistically significant
difference in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct
bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IBIL) between groups.

Among the patients with MetS, a significant
correlation was found between full-length betatrophin and
FPG (r = 0.357, P = 0.014) and 2-hour plasma glucose
(2hPG) (r = 0.38, P = 0.008). Both correlations remain
significant even after adjustment for age, sex and BMI
(FPG, adjusted r = 0.350, P = 0.020; 2hPG, adjusted r =
0.372, P = 0.013, respectively) (Table 2). No significant
correlation between full-length betatrophin and any other
clinical parameters was detected (Table 2). Circulating
total betatrophin was not correlated with these variables
among the patients with MetS (Supplementary Table 2).

Circulating betatrophin levels
As shown in Figure 2, full-length betatrophin levels
were higher in patients with MetS compared to those of
controls with statistical significance (694.84 ± 365.51 pg/
ml versus 356.64 ± 287.92 pg/ml; P < 0.001). While there
was no significant difference of total betatrophin levels
between the two groups (1.20 ± 0.79 ng/ml versus 1.31 ±
1.08 ng/ml; P = 0.524).
As shown in Figure 3, binary logistic regression
analysis of full-length betatrophin indicated subjects
in the highest tertile and the intermediate tertile of
betatrophin had significantly higher risks for developing
MetS compared with those in the lowest tertile (highest
versus lowest: OR, 8.6, 95% CI 2.8-26.8, P < 0.001;
intermediate versus lowest: OR, 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-9.3, P

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we detected the circulating
betatrophin levels by using ELISA kits from two
different manufacturers, and compared the data between
MetS patients and age-, sex-matched controls. We
have demonstrated that serum full-length but not total
betatrophin levels were higher in patients with MetS than
those in healthy controls.

Our data were supported by the work of Abu-Farha
et al [30]. This unmatched nested case-control study with
large sample size in West and South Asia indicated a 2.4
fold increased risk of MetS in subjects of the highest fulllength betatrophin level tertile compared to those of the
lowest tertile. To be noted, we used a group of strictly
matched “super healthy” controls, when they used mixed
controls with one or more metabolic disorders which did
not meet the criteria of MetS. The difference of control
selection may help explain their slighter association
compared with our study.

Nevertheless, our findings were not consistent with
another recent published study performed by Crujeiras et
al [22] in which serum total betatrophin levels of obeseMetS subjects were higher than those of normal-weight
subjects, while our study did not detect a significant
difference between MetS patients and healthy controls.
The disparity may be due to differences in anthropometric
characters and medication usage. All MetS patients
enrolled in Crujeiras’ study were obese Caucasian
and some of the patients were receiving anti-diabetic
medications. Our MetS were all drug-naïve Chinese
17513

Han population, 53% of which were not obese. Whether
oral hypoglycemic agents will affect serum betatrophin
concentration remains unclear. Based on our findings, we
hypothesized that full-length and total betatrophin may
exert different effects under various physiological and
pathological conditions, which needs to be validated by
further studies.
Our results also showed that fasting serum fulllength betatrophin levels were positively correlated with
FPG and 2hPG. Consistent with our finding, previous
studies conducted by different groups also showed
positive correlation between full-length betatrophin and
FPG or 2hPG [17, 18]. The association between fulllength betatrophin and glucose parameters confirmed

the potential role of betatrophin in the development of
T2DM, which was the dominant component of MetS.
To be noted, circulating total betatrophin level was not
found to be associated with any of these parameters in our
study. It is different from Crujeiras et al.’s results [22].
Apparently, it was the cleavage of circulating betatrophin
that contributed to the pathogenesis of these metabolic
disorders. Further investigations are required to illustrate
these mechanisms.
Our data did not find the association between
circulating full-length betatrophin level with lipid
profiles, transaminases and other parameters, which were
suggested by previous reports [17, 31]. In a recent study,
urine albumin / creatinine ratio (uACR) was considered to

be associated with the circulating betatrophin level [32].
However, uACR was not measured in our study, and could
be investigated in the future analysis.
Our study had several strengths. Firstly, both fulllength and total betatrophin concentrations were measured
in the same study population. Secondly, our study used
age- and sex- matched controls making two groups more
comparable. Thirdly, “super-healthy” criteria made a
homogenous control group. Fourthly, all participants in
our study were drug-naïve, and potential confounding
factors were adjusted.
We also have some limitations. Firstly, this study
cannot prove causality due to its cross-sectional study
design. Secondly, despite the number of included
participants reached the calculated sample size, it did not
allow further subgroup analysis due to the limited power.
Nevertheless, “super-healthy” matching controls and drug
naïve patients had adjusted major confounding factors
during the study design.
In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that
circulating full-length betatrophin concentration but
not total betatrophin concentration was higher in drugnaïve MetS patients and positively correlated with both
fasting and postprandial blood glucose. Further studies
are required to explore the potential role of circulating
betatrophin and its cleavage in the pathogenesis of MetS.

(7) taking medications for dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia,
hypertension, insulin resistance or obesity.
All subjects enrolled gave their informed consent to
participate in this study. The protocol for this study was
approved by the ethics committee at our hospital.

Sample size calculation
The sample size was calculated for a 1:1 paired
sample study with a power of 90% and a two-sided
statistical significance level of 0.05. The standard deviation
of circulating full-length betatrophin concentration was
based on a previous publication of T2DM [26]. Setting a
non-response rate of 20% resulted in a total sample size of
44 required for this study.

Anthropometric measurements
All participants provided their medical history and
received physical examination. Anthropometric and body
composition measurements were performed within two
days when blood samples were collected. Weight and
height were measured when the participants were required
to wear light clothes and barefooted after defecation. BMI
was calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by
the square of the height in meters. Waist circumference
was measured at the narrowest point between the rib cage
and the iliac crest. Hip circumference was measured at
the widest point over the hipshot. WHR was calculated
as waist circumference in centimeters divided by hip
circumference in centimeters.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and subjects
We recruited patients with MetS from the
Outpatient Clinic by the Department of Endocrinology
and Metabolism of West China Hospital and healthy
volunteers as controls from the West China Hospital
Physical Examination Center. All participants were
enrolled between July 2015 and December 2015. General
inclusion criteria for both groups were as follows: (1) aged
between 18 and 70 years old; (2) informed consent to
participate in the study; (3) adequate serum was collected
for this study. A specific inclusion criterion for the MetS
group was being diagnosed with MetS based on clinical
and laboratory assessments according to the 1998 WHO
consensus criteria [33]. Age and sex matched healthy
subjects were recruited reaching the following criteria:
normal body weight (BMI ranged from 18.5 to 23.9 kg/
m2) without self-reported metabolic disorders of MetS,
such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus,
impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose.
Based on self-reported information, the participants with
following conditions were excluded from both groups:
(1) presence of acute infectious diseases, such as acute
upper respiratory tract infection; (2) hepatic cirrhosis or
ongoing dialysis; (3) congestive heart failure; (4) known
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Biochemical measurements
All blood samples were collected after overnight
fasting for at least 8 hours. Oral glucose tolerance
test (OGTT) with 75g glucose was performed in
MetS patients. Insulin levels were measured by
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method
(Elecsys 2010, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany);
HbA1c was determined by a method based on highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) which was
approved by National Glycohemoglobin Standardization
Program (NGSP) (HLC-723 G8, Tosoh Corporation,
Japan); Plasma glucose, TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, ALT,
AST, GGT, ALP, ALB, TBIL, DBIL, IBIL, creatinine,
UA were measured on an automatic biochemistry
analyzer (Modular P800, Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Germany) according to standard laboratory procedures.
The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) is used
to quantify insulin resistance and beta-cell function.
The HOMA1-IR index was calculated by the following
formula:

Circulating betatrophin measurement
Circulating full-length betatrophin concentration
was determined using a commercially available ELISA
kit (catalog number E11644h; Wuhan Eiaab Science,
Wuhan, China) with the intra- and inter-assay coefficient
of variance (CV) ≤4.8% and ≤7.2% respectively. Total
betatrophin level (including full-length and C-terminal
fragment of betatrophin) was assessed by another ELISA
kit (catalog number EK-051-55, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals,
Phoenix, USA) [36]. The intra- and inter-assay CV were <
10% and < 15% respectively. All samples were analyzed
in duplicates according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Samples with CV > 15% were measured repeatedly.

Distribution of the data was tested by the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. FPG, TG, GGT, TBIL and
insulin (0 min) values were logarithmically transformed
before analysis due to their non-normal distribution.
After transformation, all data were normally distributed
and presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Comparisons of quantitative variables among groups were
performed by paired-samples t test. Categorical variables
were examined by χ2 test. Correlations between variables
were analyzed by Pearson’s correlation coefficients (r)
among patients with MetS. Participants were stratified
into tertiles according to the rank orders of their serum
full-length betatrophin levels in the overall population.
Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were estimated by performing binary logistic regression
analysis to assess circulating betatrophin tertile on the risk
of MetS. SPSS software version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL) was used for all statistical analysis. A P value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
