BACKGROUND: The authors sought to determine whether differences existed in patterns of outcome and
morbidity between the 3 thigh compartments after limb-sparing surgery and postoperative radiation therapy (RT). METHODS: A total of 255 patients with primary soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the thigh were identified in our sarcoma database (1982–2002). More than 80% of tumors were >5 cm, high grade, and deep;
33% had close or positive microscopic resection margins. Adjuvant RT consisted of brachytherapy alone
(BRT; 63%), external beam RT alone (EBRT; 31%), or a combination of brachytherapy and EBRT (6%). There
were 125 anterior, 58 medial, and 72 posterior lesions. The 3 compartments were balanced as to tumor
grade, size, depth, margin status, and RT type. RESULTS: Overall local control (LC) was 89%, distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) was 61%, and overall survival (OS) was 66% at 5 years (median follow-up, 71
months). Overall rates for complications at 5 years were wound reoperation (10%), edema (13%), joint stiffness (12%), nerve damage (8%), and bone fractures (7%). Wound reoperation and edema were significantly
higher for medial-compartment tumors (P ¼ .01 and .005, respectively), whereas nerve damage occurred
more frequently in posterior-compartment tumors (P < .001). There were no differences among bone fracture, joint stiffness, DMFS, or OS rates between compartments. CONCLUSIONS: Although tumor control
was similar for all 3 compartments, more wound reoperation and edema were observed in the medial compartment, and more nerve damage was noted in the posterior compartment. These results may help guide
decisions concerning current patients and improve the design of future treatments tailored to compartC 2008 American Cancer Society.

Surgery and adjuvant radiation have been well established as the standard of care for most high-risk
soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities because of the excellent local control achieved.1-3 Recent studies
have focused on factors influencing morbidity. A randomized trial by the National Cancer Institute of
Canada (NCIC) showed that wound complications were twice as common with preoperative versus

postoperative external-beam radiation therapy,
although locoregional control and progression-free survival rates were the same.2 Davis et al. showed a trend
toward more fibrosis, edema, and joint stiffness that
impacted physical disability in patients treated with
postoperative radiation therapy.4 Several studies have
found differences in outcome based on tumor location.
In a previous report from Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center (MSKCC), wound complications were
more common with a lower versus upper extremity
location.5 By using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society
Score (MSTS) and Toronto Extremity Salvage Score
(TESS),6 Gerrand et al. found worse functional outcome for deep versus superficial soft-tissue sarcomas in
the lower extremity.
Anatomically, the thigh is divided into an anterior, a
medial, and a posterior compartment. Each compartment
is uniquely characterized by its critical anatomical structures, eg, the femur and femoral nerve in the anterior
compartment, the femoral vessels in the medial compartment, and the sciatic nerve in the posterior compartment.
Whereas differences in morbidity between the thigh compartments may appear intuitive, the current study sought
to determine whether these differences become distinct
patterns of outcome and morbidity in a group of patients
with primary thigh soft-tissue sarcoma treated with limbsparing surgery and postoperative radiation therapy at a
single institution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
A review of the prospective adult (aged 16 years) database at MSKCC between August 1982 and October 2002
identified 257 patients with primary soft-tissue sarcoma
of the thigh that was treated with limb-sparing surgery
and postoperative radiation therapy. Patients were
excluded when they had had an amputation, distant metastases at presentation, or when surgery or radiation therapy were performed outside MSKCC. Two patients did
not have detailed information on the compartment, from
which the sarcoma arose, and were excluded from the
analysis. A total of 255 patients were, therefore, analyzed.

The clinical, pathologic, and treatment characteristics of
these patients are summarized in Table 1.
The median age at diagnosis was 51 years (range, 17
years to 88 years). On the basis of microscopic examination, the surgical margins were considered positive when a
tumor extended to the margin and close when a tumor
was within <1 mm of the surgical margin. Tumor size
was defined as the maximal diameter of the tumor at pathologic analysis. A deep location of a tumor (versus superficial location) was defined as any invasion of or through
the superficial fascia.
Treatment
The surgical technique used in this study has been previously described.7 In brief, all visible or palpable tumor
was resected in an en bloc fashion. Previous biopsy scars
and drain sites, when present, were included in the resection. When the tumor was intermuscular or

intramuscular, resection included 1 or more of the
involved muscle bundles. The aim was a 1–2 cm margin
in all directions, with limitations (<1 cm) aimed at preservation of all major neurovascular structures.
All 255 patients received postoperative radiation
therapy at MSKCC. Postoperative brachytherapy alone
was given to 160 (63%) patients, postoperative externalbeam radiation therapy alone to 79 (31%) patients, and a
combination of brachytherapy and external-beam radiation therapy to 16 (6%) patients. The technique of
brachytherapy has been previously described.3 In brief,
the brachytherapy technique used afterloading catheters,
which were placed intraoperatively in the tumor bed and
simultaneously evaluated by the surgeon and radiation
oncologist. During the study period, brachytherapy was
offered to most patients with primary high-grade, soft-tissue sarcoma of the thigh, as long as the geometry of the tumor bed allowed satisfactory placement of the
afterloading catheters. In our patient population, the target region to be irradiated was determined by adding 2.0
cm to the superior and inferior dimensions of the resected
tumor bed, with 1.5–2.0 cm added in the medial and lateral directions. The afterloading catheters were placed intraoperatively, approximately 1 cm apart, in the tumor
bed. The catheters were fixed in position in the target
region by absorbable sutures and secured to the skin at the
catheter exit site with buttons and nonabsorbable sutures.
A drain was placed over the tumor bed, and the wound
was closed in layers. Postoperatively, localization films
were obtained, and computerized dosimetry was
performed.
The median dose of brachytherapy alone was 45 Gy
(range, 0.58 Gy to 55 Gy), with a median dose rate of
0.41 Gy per hour. When brachytherapy was used as a
boost (n ¼ 16), the median dose was 20 Gy (range, 15 Gy
to 45 Gy), and the median external-beam radiation therapy dose was 45.9 Gy (range, 24 Gy to 66 Gy). When
external-beam radiation therapy alone was delivered, the
median dose was 64.8 Gy (range, 39.6 Gy to 75 Gy) at
1.8–2.0 Gy per fraction. The initial target volume for
external-beam radiation therapy included the tumor bed
plus a 5–10 cm margin to a dose of 40–45 Gy. This was
usually followed by 1 or 2 cone downs to bring the median total dose to 64.8 Gy.
Of the 255 patients who received postoperative radiation therapy, 218 (85%) received a ‘‘conventional’’ radiaCancer

tion dose, defined as 45 Gy for brachytherapy alone, 60
Gy to 70 Gy for external-beam radiation therapy alone,
and 15 Gy to 20 Gy in combination with 45 Gy to 50 Gy,
respectively, for patients treated with brachytherapy plus
external-beam radiation therapy. This strict definition of
the conventional dose was implemented to minimize the
potential influence of large variation in the radiation-therapy dose on outcome.
Adriamycin-based chemotherapy was given to 78
(31%) patients. Patients who received chemotherapy typically had tumors >10 cm or were generally part of early
in-house protocols evaluating the role of adjuvant chemotherapy. Therefore, the influence on chemotherapy on
outcome was not evaluated in the current study.

Complications
Complications were assessed in terms of wound reoperation, joint stiffness (mild, moderate, severe), edema (mild,
moderate, severe), peripheral nerve damage (excluding
patients who required resection of a major nerve as part of
their oncologic surgery), and bone fracture. Nerve damage
was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 criteria
(grade 1, asymptomatic neuropathy; grade 2, symptomatic neuropathy not interfering with activities of daily
living [ADLs]; grade 3, neuropathy interfering with
ADLs; grade 4, disabling or life-threatening neuropathy).

Statistical Analysis
The time of follow-up was calculated from the date of the
first operation at MSKCC. The median follow-up time
for all 255 patients was 71 months. In patients who were
still alive at their last follow-up visit, the median followup time was 108 months. Local recurrence was defined as
any recurrence in the primary site, regardless of distant
recurrence.
Association between variables was tested by using
the chi-square test. For variables with few observations,
Fisher exact test was used.8 The survival rates and actuarial
complication rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier
product-limit method.9 Comparisons of survival curves
were performed by the log-rank test.10 A multistep Cox
regression analysis was used for multivariate analysis of

tion therapy type, and radiation dose (Table 2). There
was, however, a significant difference in the rate of vessel
resection and nerve resection or neurolysis between compartments. The rate of vessel resection was 38% for the
medial compartment versus 12.5% for the posterior and
9% for the anterior compartment (P < .0001). The rate
of nerve resection or neurolysis was 36% for the posterior
compartment versus 14% for the anterior and 28% for
the medial compartment (P ¼ .002). The rate of periosteal stripping or bone resection was 21% for the anterior
compartment versus 12% for the medial and 4% for the
posterior compartment (P ¼ .005).
Tumor Control
Of the 255 patients, 9% (n ¼ 24) developed local recurrence; 12 of 125 (10%) in the anterior, 8 of 58 (14%) in
the medial, and 4 of 72 (6%) in the posterior compartment. The overall 5-year LC rate was 89% (95% CI,
85.1%–93.6%). There was no statistically significant difference in LC across compartments. The rate was 90%
(95% CI, 84%–96%) for the anterior, 84% (95% CI,
74%–94%) for the medial, and 91% (95% CI, 83%–
99%) for the posterior compartment (P ¼ .3) as shown in
Figure 1. Tumor size and margin status did not significantly influence LC. The percentage of patients free of

tumors was 90.5% (95% CI, 84.7%–96.3%) and 88.2%
(95% CI, 81.9%–94.4%), respectively (P ¼ .39). In
patients with a margin-negative resection, the percentage
of patients free of local recurrence at 5 years was 91.4%
(95% CI, 86.8%–96.0%) versus 85.1% (95% CI,
76.2%–94.0%) for those with a close and positive margin
(P ¼ .14). The overall 5-year distant metastases-free survival was 61% (95% CI, 54%–67%), and overall survival
was 66% (95% CI, 60%–72%). Anatomic compartment
did not significantly impact distant metastases-free survival (P ¼ .3) nor overall survival (P ¼ .5).
Wound Reoperation
Wound complications requiring reoperation developed in
9% of patients (n ¼ 24), with 6 of 125 (5%) tumors arising from the anterior, 10 of 58 (17%) from the medial,
and 8 of 72 (11%) from the posterior compartment. The
overall 5-year actuarial rate for wound reoperation was
10% (95% CI, 6%–14%). The rate of wound reoperation
was significantly influenced by compartment. The 5-year
actuarial rates were 4.9% (95% CI, 1.0%–8.8%) for the
anterior compartment and 14.6% (95% CI, 8.2%–
20.9%) for the medial and posterior compartments (P ¼
.014) as shown in Figure 2A. The influence of other
potential prognostic factors on wound reoperation was
also assessed. Higher rates of wound reoperation were
associated with the use of brachytherapy versus externalbeam radiation therapy (12.4% vs 3.9%, respectively; P ¼
.046), older age (14.1% for >50 years vs 5.7% for 50
years; P ¼ .03), and whether vessel resection was performed (20.5% with vessel resection vs 7.9% without vessel resection; P ¼ .01). On multivariate analysis, the
medial and posterior compartment were marginally significant (P ¼ .057), but age >50 years, brachytherapy,
and vessel resection were all independent predictors of the
need for wound reoperation (Table 3).

Edema and Joint Stiffness
Edema developed in 34 (13%) patients, with 13 of 125
(10%) tumors located in the anterior, 13 of 58 (22%) in
the medial, and 8 of 72 (11%) in the posterior compartment. The overall 5-year actuarial rate of edema was 13%
(95% CI, 8%–17%). Twelve patients had mild edema; 17
patients had moderate edema; and 5 patients had severe

edema. The percentage of patients with edema at 5 years
was significantly higher for medial (25.7%; 95% CI,
12%–39%) than for anterior and posterior compartment
tumors (9.0%; 95% CI, 4.7%–13.5%; P ¼ .005) as
shown in Figure 2B. Compared with brachytherapy,
external-beam radiation therapy was associated with a
higher percentage of patients with edema at 5 years (5.7%
vs 26.7%, respectively; P < .0001). Other predictors were
female sex, tumor size >10 cm, and vessel resection. On
multivariate analysis, only medial-compartment tumors,
female sex, and external-beam radiation therapy were independent predictors of edema (Table 4).
Joint stiffness developed in 13% of patients (n ¼
32), with 16 of 125 (13%) tumors arising from the anterior, 5 of 58 (9%) from the medial, and 11 of 72 (15%)
from the posterior compartment. The overall percentage
of patients with joint stiffness at 5 years was 12% (95%
CI, 7.4%–16%). Joint stiffness was mild (19 patients),
moderate (9 patients), or severe (3 patients). For 1 patient,

the grade of joint stiffness was unknown. Unlike with
wound reoperation and edema, the compartment did not
impact the rate of joint stiffness (12.9% anterior, 95% CI,
6.7%–19.2%; 9.3% medial, 95% CI, 1.4%–17.3%; 10.7
% posterior compartment, 95% CI, 3%–18.3%; P ¼
.35). Joint stiffness was significantly associated with large
tumor size (19.0% for >10 cm vs 4.3% for 10 cm; P ¼
.0001) and type of radiation therapy (external-beam radiation therapy 27.0% vs brachytherapy 4.6%; P < .0001).
Those 2 factors remained independent predictors of joint
stiffness on multivariate analysis (external-beam radiation
therapy hazard ratio [HR], 2.9; P ¼ .02; brachytherapy
HR, 6.1; P < .0001).
Nerve Damage and Bone Fracture
Nerve damage was assessed only in patients who did not
undergo nerve resection at the time of operation (n ¼
227). Of these 227 patients, 20 (9%) developed nerve
damage, with 5 of 115 (4%) tumors arising from the anterior, 2 of 47 (4%) from the medial, and 13 of 65 (20%)

from the posterior compartment. The overall actuarial
rate of patients with nerve damage at 5 years was 8%
(95% CI, 4.4%–12.2%). There were 7 patients with
grade 1, 2 patients with grade 2, 2 patients with grade 3,
and 9 patients with grade 4 nerve damage. The percentage
of patients with nerve damage at 5 years was significantly
higher in patients with posterior (21.1%; 95% CI,
10.2%–32.0%) versus anterior and medial compartment
tumors (3.5%; 95% CI, 0.4%–6.6) (P < .001) as shown
in Figure 2C. The only other predictor of nerve damage
was neurolysis. The percentage of patients with nerve
damage at 5 years was 27.0% versus 5.2% for patients
with versus patients without neurolysis at the time of
operation (P ¼ .0003). On multivariate analysis, a posterior-compartment tumor location and neurolysis were independent predictors of nerve damage (Table 5).

(3%) from the medial, and 3 of 72 (4%) from the posterior compartment. The overall percentage of patients
with fracture at 5 years was 6.9% (95% CI, 3.1%–
10.7%). Although there were more fractures at 5 years in
the anterior (8.6%; 95% CI, 3.0%–14.2%) versus the
medial and posterior compartment (5.1%; 95% CI,
0.0%–10.1%), this difference was statistically insignificant (P ¼ .25). Bone fractures occurred more frequently
in patients who had surgical manipulation of the femur.
The rate was 24.8% (95% CI, 7.8%–41.8%) when the
periosteum was stripped or the bone was resected versus
4.1% (95% CI, 0.8%–7.4%) in patients with an intact
femur (P< .0001). Other significant predictors of fracture on univariate analysis were external-beam radiation
therapy instead of brachytherapy, age >50 years, and
female sex. On multivariate analysis, all these factors
retained their independence except for external-beam
radiation therapy (Table 6).

DISCUSSION
Reducing morbidity from adjuvant therapy in oncology is
an important task. Soft-tissue sarcoma can arise from any
part of the body; thus, general toxicity data are of little
help to the individual patient. Knowledge has accumulated that allows for better estimation of morbidity in extremity versus nonextremity sites and between extremity
locations ie, upper versus lower.5,6 In the current study,
the aim was to study morbidity and outcome in soft-tissue
sarcoma of the thigh. Thigh sarcoma, about one-third of
all sarcomas, represents an ideal target for such investigation because of its 3 unique anatomical compartments
and high incidence.12,13
In the current study, the 5-year LC rate was 89%,
similar to other reports.2,7,14 There was no statistically significant influence of the compartment on the 5-year LC
rates in this study; 90% for the anterior, 84% for the
medial, and 91% for the posterior compartment (P ¼ .3).
Distant metastases-free survival and overall survival rates
were not influenced by compartment. Compartments
were balanced by age, grade, tumor size, depth, and margin status; this is consistent with comparable tumor control according to compartment. Data on complications by
thigh compartment are scant. In the current study, the
rate of wound reoperation was associated with medial and
posterior versus anterior compartment tumors (14.6% vs
4.9%; P ¼ .01). On multivariate analysis, the use of
brachytherapy, age >50 years, and vessel resection were
independent predictors of wound reoperation. Significant
wound complications that require reoperation have previously been shown to be influenced by radiation therapy
parameters and tumor location. In the NCIC trial,2 the
rate of wound complication was significantly higher with
preoperative (35%) versus postoperative (17%) radiation
therapy (P ¼ .01). In the brachytherapy trial from
MSKCC, the timing of brachytherapy after surgery also
had a significant impact on wound complication.15,16
Pradhan reported a 36% incidence of wound complications, including seroma, purulent discharge, and wound
reoperation in soft-tissue sarcoma of the adductor compartment. Although the rate of wound complication was
high in his study, no comparison to other thigh compartments was made.17
Because the majority of venous and lymphatic drainage runs through the medial compartment of the thigh, it
is not surprising that the rate of edema was significantly
higher in that compartment (25.7%) versus the anterior
156

and posterior compartments (9.0%). Cannon et al. identified an anatomical correlation between higher rates of
chronic complications, including edema, and a proximal
tumor location in the groin or proximal thigh.18 Other
risk factors for edema that have been reported in the literature include larger radiation therapy portals and radiation-therapy doses 60 Gy to 63 Gy.19 In contrast to
wound reoperation and edema, the unique anatomical
features of the 3 thigh compartments did not impact joint
stiffness in our study (P ¼ .35). Only the use of externalbeam radiation therapy and tumor size >10 cm were independent predictors of joint stiffness. The rate of bone
fracture was not significantly influenced by compartment
either (8.6% for anterior vs 5.1% for medial and posterior
compartments), but was independently affected by age
>50 years, female sex, and bone manipulation. Other
investigators have also shown a correlation to fracture risk
of higher radiation therapy doses of 60 Gy to 66 Gy, periosteal stripping, female sex, and radiation therapy to the
entire circumference of the bone.18,20
In the current study, when patients with documented nerve resection were excluded, the overall incidence of nerve damage at 5 years was 8.3%. Other
investigators have also reported nerve damage rates
between 2% and 7%.21,22 In the current study, the rate of
nerve damage was significantly influenced by compartment (21.1% for posterior vs 3.5% for anterior and
medial compartments; P < .001). On multivariate analysis, tumor location in the posterior compartment retained
its independent status as a predictor of nerve damage. The
length that the sciatic nerve traverses in the posterior compartment of the thigh and the high rate of pre-existing sciatica in the general population (13% to 40%)23 may
partly explain the high likelihood of incurring an injury
from treatment.
In conclusion, soft-tissue sarcoma of the thigh has
distinct patterns of morbidity based on its anatomical
compartment of origin. Although tumor control was similar for all 3 compartments, more wound reoperation and
edema were observed in the medial compartment, and
more nerve damage was noted in the posterior compartment. These data identify patients at high risk for wound
complications and, thus, those who may benefit from tissue transfer. The remaining complications, eg, edema and
nerve damage, are consistent with the anatomical contents
and risks in each compartment. These data provide

information that can lead to more adequate counseling
and surveillance of patients, that can help guide decisions
on the best treatment approach, and that can help early
recognition of morbidities, which, in turn, should lead to
prompt initiation of rehabilitative care.
