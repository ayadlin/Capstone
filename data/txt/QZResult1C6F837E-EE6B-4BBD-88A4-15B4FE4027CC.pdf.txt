Abstract
In breast carcinomas, patient survival seems to be negatively affected by the recruitment of regulatory T cells
(Treg) within lymphoid aggregates by CCL22. However, the mechanisms underpinning this process, which may be
of broader significance in solid tumors, have yet to be described. In this study, we determined how CCL22
production is controlled in tumor cells. In human breast carcinoma cell lines, CCL22 was secreted at low basal
levels that were strongly increased in response to inflammatory signals [TNF-a, IFN-g, and interleukin (IL)-1b],
contrasting with CCL17. Primary breast tumors and CD45þ infiltrating immune cells appeared to cooperate in
driving CCL22 secretion, as shown clearly in cocultures of breast tumor cell lines and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) or their supernatants. We determined that monocyte-derived IL-1b and TNF-a are
key players as monocyte depletion or neutralization of these cytokines attenuated secretion of CCL22. However,
when purified monocytes were used, exogenous human IFN-g was also required to generate this response
suggesting a role for IFN-g–producing cells within PBMCs. In this setting, we found that human IFN-g could be
replaced by the addition of (i) IL-2 or K562-activated natural killer (NK) cells or (ii) resting NK cells in the
presence of anti-MHC class I antibody. Taken together, our results show a dialogue between NK and tumor cells
leading to IFN-g secretion, which in turn associates with monocyte-derived IL-1b and TNF-a to drive production
of CCL22 by tumor cells and subsequent recruitment of Treg. As one validation of this conclusion in primary
breast tumors, we showed that NK cells and macrophages tend to colocalize within tumors. In summary, our
findings suggest that at early times during tumorigenesis, the detection of tumor cells by innate effectors
(monocytes and NK cells) imposes a selection for CCL22 secretion that recruits Treg to evade this early antitumor
immune response. Cancer Res; 71(19); 6143–52. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer immunosubversion is a process by which tumor
cells escape destruction by the immune system through a
variety of mechanisms including the production of immunosuppressive cytokines and the alteration of dendritic cell (DC)
functions (1, 2).
Several studies have shown that immune cells are present
and functional in solid tumors and may promote both hu-

moral and cellular antitumor immune responses. As an example, high levels of CD8þ T cells within the tumors have been
associated with a better clinical prognosis in colorectal cancer
(3). However, in most of the cases these T cells are unable to
counteract tumor progression. In cancer patients, increased
levels of CD4þCD25highFOXP3þ regulatory T cells (Treg), a
lymphocyte subset with immunosuppressive properties, are
described in the peripheral blood, the primary tumor microenvironment, and in the draining lymph nodes, supporting a
role for Treg in cancer-induced immunosuppression. However,
their effect on tumor progression varies according to the
tumor type in humans. Treg have a negative impact on survival
in lung, pancreatic, gastric, liver, or ovarian carcinoma
patients (4–7), whereas they may exert a beneficial role in
B-cell lymphoma, head and neck, or colon carcinoma (8, 9) or
have no impact in colon, prostate, renal, or anal squamous cell
carcinoma (10, 11; for review, see ref. 12).
We recently obtained evidence, in breast carcinoma,
that selectively activated Treg accumulation within lymphoid
aggregates, but not in the tumor bed, has a negative impact on
patients’ survival (13). Elucidating the mechanisms involved

in Treg trafficking and accumulation in the breast tumor
environment is thereby critical for innovative therapeutic
development to fight tumor-induced immunosuppression.
Experiments in mice using Treg from CCR4/ or conditional CCR4 knockout in FOXP3þ Treg compartment have
recently identified the critical role of CCR4 in Treg trafficking
in secondary lymphoid organs or tissues (14, 15). Curiel and
colleagues strongly suggested a role for CCR4/CCL22 axis in
Treg recruitment in ovarian ascitis (4).
We recently showed the selective loss of membrane CCR4
on tumor-associated Treg (TA-Treg) consecutive to an active
recruitment through a CC chemokine (CCL22), and that breast
tumors lacking CCL22 are not colonized by Treg independently
of their CCL17 expression status (13), strongly suggesting the
importance of CCL22 in TA-Treg recruitment within breast
tumors.
CCL22, produced by myeloid DCs (mDC), B cells, macrophages, keratinocytes, or epithelial cells (6, 16, 17) and CCL17
closely related to CCL22, produced by monocyte-derived DC
(18) and keratinocytes (19), are 2 ligands for CCR4 (6, 20)
preferentially expressed on Th2 lymphocytes (21) and Treg (for
review, see ref. 12). In peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC), CCL22 is upregulated by interleukin (IL)-4, whereas it
is downregulated by IFN-g treatment (22). In contrast, IFN-g
favored CCL22 secretion by keratinocytes (16, 23) and intestinal epithelial cells (24).
In this study, we showed that breast tumor cell recognition by NK cells leads to their activation and IFN-g secretion,
which in turn triggers CCL22 production by tumor cells
through cooperation with monocyte-derived IL-1b and
TNF-a.

Materials and Methods
Breast tumor cell lines culture
All tumor cell lines used in this study originated from
American Type Culture Collection except CLB-SAV generated
in the laboratory. Cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen) completed with 10% FBS (Lonza), 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen; complete
medium) at 37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
Primary breast tumors
Breast tumor tissues collected at the Centre Leon Berard
after patient informed consent were mechanically dilacerated
to obtain "mechanic tumor disaggregation supernatants" and
then subjected to enzymatic digestion as previously described
(13).
Flow cytometry analyses (ADP Cyan; Beckman Coulter)
were conducted to assess the percentage of NK cells
(CD3NKp46þ) and macrophages (CD4þCD68þCD163þ; all
from Becton Dickinson except for CD163 from eBiosciences
and CD68 from Dako Cytomation) within primary tumor cell
suspension after gating on CD45þ cells, and data were analyzed with FlowJo Analysis Software (Tree Star).
Immune cells (CD45þ) or NK cells (CD3CD56þ) and
macrophages (CD4lowCD163þ) were purified on single-cell

suspension from breast primary tumor or ascitis, respectively,
by cell sorting (FACS Aria; Becton Dickinson).
Breast tumor supernatants
Single-cell suspensions from primary or metastatic (ascitis,
pleural effusion) breast tumors were incubated at a final
concentration of 15  106 cells/mL in complete medium in
petri dishes. Cultured tumor cell supernatants were collected
after 48 hours, filtrated on 0.22 mm, and frozen.
Immunohistochemistry
Expression of CCL22 on paraffin-embedded sections of
breast tumor or peritumoral tissue was analyzed with a goat
anti-CCL22 antibody (Ab; Santa Cruz) as previously described
(13). Routinely used CD163 (mIgG1; Menarini Diagnostics)
staining was carried out according to the manufacturer.
NKp46þ was detected as previously described (25) cells with
a goat immunoglobulin G Ab (R&D Systems). Hematoxylincounterstained sections were dehydrated and mounted. For
negative control slides, primary antibodies were replaced by a
nonimmune serum.
Cytokines and antibodies
Recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor (rhGM-CSF; specific activity: 2  106
U/mg, used at 100 ng/mL) and rhIL-4 (specific activity:
106 U/mg, used at 50 ng/mL) were from Schering Plough
Research Institute. rhTNF-a (specific activity: 5  106 U/mg)
at 10 ng/mL was provided by Cetus Corporation. rhIL-1b
(109 IU/mg), rhIFN-g (2  107 IU/mg), and IL-1RA were from
Peprotech. rhCCL22, rhCCL17, rhCXCL12, and monoclonal
Ab (mAb) against CXCL12 and CCL22 as well as isotype
controls used for neutralization experiments were from R&D
Systems.
Purification of cell subsets from peripheral blood
Total PBMCs were isolated from heparinized blood
obtained from healthy volunteers by Ficoll Hypaque density
gradient centrifugation (Dominique Dutscher). Purified mDCs
and monocyte fractions were obtained using positive selection
kits, whereas untouched NK cells were purified using negative
selection kit (Miltenyi Biotech) and purity was confirmed by
flow cytometry. For depletion experiments, different cell
subsets [myeloid cells, (mDC), plasmacytoid DCs (pDC),
monocytes, NK cells, and T cells] were specifically depleted
from PBMCs using positive selection kits with magnetic beads.
The absence of remaining positive cells in the depleted
fraction was confirmed by flow cytometry.
Culture conditions
Tumor cell lines were cultured at 2  105 cells/mL in
complete medium in 48-well plates (Becton Dickinson) and
incubated for 24 or 48 hours in medium condition or in the
presence of rhIFN-g (0.1–100 ng/mL depending on the studies). Coculture experiments were carried out by incubating 105
tumor cells with 106 PBMC for 24 or 48 hours in the presence
of 100 ng/mL rhGM-CSF with or without rhIFN-g. To characterize the cell subset responsible for CCL22 secretion, PBMC

CCRF-CEM cells were added in the insert.

Cytokine detection
CCL22, CCL17 and IL-1b, and TNF-a levels were quantified
in cell supernatants using ELISA from R&D Systems and
Bender MedSystems, respectively.

Results
High levels of CCL22 but not CCL17 are detectable in
primary breast tumors
Analyses of breast TUM-SN showed the production of high
levels of CCL22 in TUM-SN from primary tumors (Fig. 1A) that
decreased in metastatic ones. CCL22 was also detectable in
supernatants of mechanical tumor disaggregation from 27
primary tumors (mean ¼ 1.02 ng/mL; range, 0.13–6.9 ng/mL).
Low levels of CCL17 were detected in these TUM-SN. Moreover, supernatant from nontumor tissues (healthy breast
tissue and fibro-adenoma) did not produce significant levels
of CCL22 or CCL17.
We have previously shown that expression of CCL22, but
not that of CCL17 by tumor cells in breast tumors, correlates
with TA-Treg infiltration (13).
In contrast to primary breast tumors where a strong CCL22
expression was observed by immunohistochemistry (IHC;

Migration in response to CCL22
CCR4 expression on the CCRF-CEM cell line was confirmed
by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S1). Migration assays
were conducted using Transwell (6.5-mm diameter; CoStar)
with 5  105 cells/well. After 2 hours of preincubation at 37 C,
CCRF-CEM cells were placed in 3-mm pore size inserts (100
mL) and tested for their ability to migrate in response to
rhCCL22 (1–50 ng/mL) or culture supernatants (50%) added
in the lower well. After 1 hour and 30 minutes of incubation at
37 C, cells were collected in cold PBS–EDTA and resuspended
after centrifugation in 100 mL. The number of migrated cells
was analyzed by flow cytometry. In blockade experiments,
anti-CXCL12 or -CCL22 mAb or their isotype controls were

Fig. 1C; ref. 13), CCL22 displayed a weak apical expression in
peritumoral area by luminal breast epithelial cells within
lobular acini (Fig. 1B).
Breast tumor cell lines produce functional CCL22 in
response to Th1/innate immunity but not Th2 signals
Contrasting with primary tumors, spontaneous CCL22 secretion by breast tumor cell lines in vitro was low to undetectable (Fig. 2A), suggesting mechanisms of regulation and a
role of the microenvironment in CCL22 expression by tumor
cells. Indeed, addition of rhIFN-g, a CCL22 inducer on keratinocytes (16, 23) and intestinal epithelial cells (24), induced
strong CCL22 secretion on 5 of 7 tested cell lines (0. 28–1.1
ng/mL for IFN-g; Fig. 2A). In contrast, in PBMCs, CCL22
production was downregulated by rhIFN-g but upregulated
by rhIL-4 (Fig. 2B).
When bulk primary breast tumor disaggregation was used,
the secretion of CCL22 was lost upon depletion of CD45þ
immune cells. This CCL22 production by CD45-negative primary tumor was restored (9-fold increase) either by addition
of associated CD45þ infiltrate (3  104 CD45þ for 8  104
tumor cells) or rhIFN-g (Fig. 2C), strongly suggesting the
cooperation between tumor cells and immune cells for specific CCL22 secretion.
This observation was confirmed using breast tumor cell
lines. The addition of allogeneic PBMCs to breast tumor cell
lines strongly enhanced the production of CCL22 but not of
CCL17. We observed a 12.8-, 18-, and 121-fold increase for
CLB-SAV, MDA-MB453, and MCF-7 cell lines, respectively, in
coculture condition when compared with tumor cells alone.

This secretion was further enhanced by rhIFN-g addition (17and 5.5-fold increase in CCL22 production for CLB-SAV and
MDA-MB453 or MCF-7, respectively; Fig. 2D).
To test the functionality of the CCL22 secreted in PBMC/
tumor cell coculture supernatants, we used the CCRF-CEM Tcell line that expresses CCR4 and migrates in response to
rhCCL22 in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B). The coculture supernatant favored the
CCRF-CEM cell migration in a Transwell Assay (5-fold increase over background level) that was specifically blocked by
preincubation of these supernatants with an anti-CCL22
neutralizing mAb but not with an anti-CXCL12 able to attract
CXCR4þ CCRF-CEM (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Soluble factors produced by activated PBMCs induce
CCL22 secretion by tumor cells
Whereas PBMCs alone are devoid of IFN-g secretion (Supplementary Fig. S3, bottom), coculture with tumor cells increased this production favoring CCL22. Furthermore, as
previously mentioned, addition of rhIFN-g strongly enhanced
CCL22 production in PBMC/tumor cell coculture while decreasing that of PBMCs (Fig. 2D). We therefore wished to
decipher the relative role of PBMCs and tumor cells in CCL22
secretion in the PBMC/tumor cell coculture in the presence of
rhIFN-g. We compared the impact of rhIFN-g-activated
PBMC-SN on CCL22 production by tumor cell lines with that
of rhIFN-g-activated TUM-SN on PBMCs. As shown in Fig. 3,
CCL22 levels secreted by rhIFN-g-treated tumor cells were
strongly enhanced in the presence of rhIFN-g-PBMC-SN (2.75-,
19.36-, and 16.46-fold, respectively, for MDA-MB453, MCF-7,

Innate Immune Recognition Triggers CCL22 by Breast Tumor Cells

Interestingly, the effects observed were specific for CCL22
as CXCL8 that was produced by rhIFN-g-activated PBMCs was
downregulated in the presence of tumor cells and not induced
when tumor cells were cultured with PBMC-SN (data not
shown).

Monocytes and IFN-g are both required for the
secretion of CCL22 by tumor cells
To determine the major cell fraction within PBMC responsible for the effects observed on tumor cells, specific depletions
of myeloid cells (CD33þ), monocytes (CD14þ), mDC
(BDCA1þBDCA3þ), pDC (BDCA2þ), NK cells (CD56þ), or T
cells (CD3þ) were carried out using magnetic beads. Each
depleted fraction was added on tumor cell lines in the presence
of rhIFN-g to assess the CCL22 production. As shown in Fig. 4A,
whereas addition of PBMCs induced a strong CCL22 production (2.95  0.1 ng/mL), we observed a drop in this secretion
when monocyte (CD14) or myeloid cell (CD33)-depleted
fractions were used (86% and 75% inhibition, respectively). In
contrast, the depletion of NK cells or T cells did not decrease
the CCL22 secretion. The increase observed with T-cell depletion likely results from increased monocyte percentage in the
culture. The depletion of mDCs reduced the basal level of
CCL22 produced by PBMCs alone as shown in Supplementary
Fig. S2 (26) but did not affect the CCL22 production by tumor
cells. These results suggest that monocytes are the main actors
in CCL22 production by tumor cells within the coculture.

suggest that rhIFN-g-treated PBMCs produce soluble factors
capable of inducing CCL22 production by tumor cells.

To confirm their role, purified monocytes were added to

PBMC action on tumor cells, further addition of rhIFN-g-induced CCL22 levels comparable with those obtained with
PBMC. This effect was specific to monocytes as mDC, even
in presence of IFN-g, did not reconstitute PBMC effect. Of
most importance, these results suggest that monocytes act in
cooperation with other cell subsets (i.e., NK cells, NKT cells, or
T cells) capable of IFN-g secretion to increase CCL22 secretion
by tumor cells.

NK cells and monocytes cooperate to induce CCL22
production by tumor cells
To better understand the mechanisms involved in IFN-g
secretion within PBMC/tumor cell coculture (Supplementary
Fig. S3) that act in synergy with IL-1b and TNF-a, we hypothesized that NK cells could be activated and secrete IFN-g after
interaction with tumor cells.
To mimic NK activation, NK cells were pretreated with IL-2
for 16 hours. We tested their impact on CCL22 production by
tumor cells in the presence of purified monocytes or mDCdepleted PBMC fraction. Whereas activated NK cells, mDC-

Involvement of rhIL-1b and TNF-a in inducing CCL22
secretion by tumor cells
As shown above (Fig. 4A), depletion of monocytes strongly
reduced the ability of tumor cells to produce CCL22 in
coculture. Monocytes are strong producers of IL-1b and
TNF-a, previously described to cooperate with IFN-g in
CCL22 production on epithelial cells or keratinocytes (24,
27, 28). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3, whereas PBMC
produced low IL-1b and TNF-a levels (6.5  0.2 and 99  1
pg/mL, respectively), the addition of rhIFN-g increased their
secretion (IL-1b, 133  12 pg/mL; and TNF-a, 879  53
pg/mL). These 2 cytokines are also detected in tumor cell
line/PBMC coculture in the presence of rhIFN-g. Moreover,
the loss of CCL22 production in monocyte-depleted fraction
was associated with the absence of IL-1b and TNF-a secretion
in the coculture (data not shown).
Whereas CCL22 production by MDA-MB453 cells was mostly dependent on IFN-g (Supplementary Fig. S4A and C), the
culture of MCF-7 (Supplementary Fig. S4B and D) or CLB-SAV
(data not shown) with a cross range of recombinant cytokines
showed an important impact of low doses of IL-1b (100 pg/mL)
or TNF-a (10 ng/mL) on CCL22 production with an additive
effect of IFN-g (Supplementary Fig. S4B and D).
To confirm a role for these 2 cytokines within rhIFNg-PBMC-SN, in CCL22 secretion by tumor cells, we tested
the impact of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) or an antiTNF-a blocking Ab, previously validated (Supplementary
Fig. S5A), on tumor cell line cultures. As shown in Fig. 4C,
treatment with either IL-1RA or anti-TNF-a mAb was able to
block 40% of CCL22 secretion induced by rhIFN-g-PBMC-SN.
The simultaneous blockade of IL-1b and TNF-a decreased
CCL22 secretion up to 80%, showing the role of IL-1b and
TNF-a contained in rhIFN-g-PBMC-SN on CCL22 secretion by
tumor cells.

(mDC; 106), IL-2–activated NK cells (IL-2–NK; 105), or their combination
were added on 24-hour medium–pretreated breast tumor cells (MCF-7,
MDA-MB453; 105), and CCL22 secretion was analyzed after a 48-hour
culture period. The control was carried out by addition of mDC-depleted
fraction (106) on rhIFN-g-pretreated tumor cells. B, purified monocytes
(CD14þ; 105), IL-2–activated NK cells (IL-2-NK; 105), or their combination

culture.

depleted fraction, or purified monocytes each alone (Fig. 5A
and B) did not trigger CCL22 production by tumor cells, a
combination of activated NK cells with either mDC-depleted
fraction (Fig. 5A) or purified monocytes (Fig. 5B) induced
CCL22 levels comparable with those obtained in the presence
of PBMCs or exogenous rhIFN-g (Fig. 5A). This suggests that
IFN-g released by activated NK cells cooperates with monocytes to promote CCL22 release by tumor cells.
Interaction of K562 tumor cell line with NK cells also favors
their activation (29). The addition of K562 (1:1 K562:NK ratio)
to resting NK cells in the presence of purified monocytes and
tumor cells increased CCL22 secretion by tumor cells that was
dependent on IFN-g as anti-IFN-gR1 blocking mAb reversed
this effect (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Because tumor cell lines upregulate MHC class I in response
to IFN-g or TNF-a (Supplementary Fig. S7), we neutralized
MHC class I expression on tumor cells as an alternative
approach to revert blockade of NK activation through MHC
class I/killer inhibitory receptor (KIR) interactions. The preincubation of tumor cells with blocking anti-MHC class I mAb
(W6/32) before the addition of resting NK cells and monocytes
significantly increased the CCL22 production. This increase
was strictly dependent on the presence of NK cells and

subsequent IFN-g secretion associated with the release of
monocyte-derived IL-1b and TNF-a that triggers CCL22 production by tumor cells. This tumor cell–associated CCL22
secretion favors blood CCR4þ Treg recruitment leading to the
development of a tolerogenic environment conducive to the
tumor immunosubversion and development.
We previously reported a strong correlation between
CCL22 expression by tumor cells and the presence of Treg
within breast tumor environment. Breast tumors lacking
CCL22 are not colonized by Treg independently of their
CCL17 expression status (13). Moreover, Treg recruitment
in tumor environment induces a loss of CCR4 expression, a
phenomenon observed when Treg are cultured in vitro with
CCL22 but not with CCL17 (30). Similar observations were
made for CCR7 expression that was downregulated on
T cells after interaction with CCL19 but not with CCL21
(31, 32). In agreement with our observation, CCR4 and
CCL22 requirement for Treg recruitment was also reported
in the mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease, in which
the inability of CCR4/ Treg to migrate within the colon
tissue leads to disease exacerbation (15).
Our IHC analyses show, in peritumoral breast tissue samples, polarized apical CCL22 secretion by healthy luminal
epithelial cells within lobular acini as described for other
chemokines (CXCL8, GROb, GROg, GROa, ENA78, MIG,
IP10, and RANTES) detected in the milk or the colostrum
(33, 34). Moreover, nonhematopoietic cells such as keratinocytes and epithelial cells can secrete CCL22 (16, 24, 35).
Polarized CCL22 secretion toward the lumen has also been
described in colon epithelium (24). Moreover, the cyclic
hormonal modulation may also affect Treg recruitment within
the mammary gland via CCL22 secretion by epithelial cells.
Indeed, treatment of women with progesterone favors in the
endometrium a high CCL22 production by stromal cells and
glandular epithelial cells at the end of the hormonal cycle (35).
Taken together, these results suggest that CCL22 secretion
within the breast tissue may be part of the mammary gland
physiology controlling the local inflammation associated with
tissue remodeling either at the end of the menstrual cycle or
during breastfeeding.
In accordance with structural disorganization characteristic of primary breast tumor tissue, we observed that CCL22
secretion is no more polarized favoring its diffusion within the
tumor environment that may favor recruitment of macrophages, NK cells, Th2 cells (6), and Treg (for review, see ref. 12)
expressing CCR4. Moreover CCL22 production is strongly
enhanced when compared with healthy tissue. This is consistent with the levels of CCL22 found either in primary breast
tumor mechanical disaggregation SNs (median ¼ 1.16 ng/mL;
range, 0.23–8.8 ng/mL) or in 48-hour culture primary breast
TUM-SN with more than 40-fold increase in CCL22 levels
(median ¼ 2.91 ng/mL; range, 0.53–12.4 ng/mL) in comparison with nontumor SN (median ¼ 0.07 ng/mL; range, 0.03–
0.23 ng/mL; P ¼ 0.004). It is also important to notice that
CCL22 content is 10-fold higher than that of CCL17 (median ¼
0.3 ng/mL; range, 0–4.4 ng/mL). Importantly, we show using
either primary breast tumor or tumor cell lines the cooperation between tumor cells and immune infiltrate to induce

6150

high quantities of CCL22, whereas CCL17 secretion remains
barely detectable. Interestingly, although healthy bronchial
epithelial cells secrete CCL17 (36), their tumor counterpart in
lung carcinoma pleural effusion produces CCL22 (37). Taken
together, these results suggest the capacity of the tumor
environment to modulate the chemokine arsenal of epithelial
cells to favor the migration of specific cell subsets. CCL17, via
the recruitment of Th2 CCR4þ cells, will favor a Th2 response
as described in atopic dermatitis (38), whereas CCL22 is more
specialized in the recruitment of Treg as observed in tumors
(for review, see ref. 12).
IL-4 and IL-13, critically involved in the development of
cutaneous pathologies like atopic dermatitis, have been largely shown to induce CCL22 secretion by cells of myeloid origin
(monocytes and mDCs; refs. 22, 39) and to favor CCL17
production by fibroblasts (40). In contrast, we showed in this
study that IL-4 reduces the CCL22 production in breast tumor
epithelial cell lines as previously described for immortalized
keratinocytes (16, 23), colon epithelial cells (24), and glioma
cell lines (41).
In this study, we deciphered the mechanisms involved in
the increased secretion of CCL22 within the tumor environment. We showed the existence of a dialogue between tumor
cells and circulating immune cells leading to CCL22 production by tumor cells and to Treg recruitment. We reported that
breast tumor cell lines produced CCL22 in response to rhIFN-g,
as previously described for keratinocytes (16, 23). This secretion is strongly enhanced in coculture with PBMCs but is lost
after myeloid cell (CD33þ) or monocyte (CD14þ) depletion
showing the major role of monocytes in this CCL22 secretion
although they do not secrete CCL22 by themselves.
NK cells constitute a unique component of the innate
immune system able, without specific sensitization, to recognize autologous cells undergoing various form of stress, such
as malignant transformation (42). Target recognition occurs
via the integration of negative and positive signals mediated
by inhibitory (KIR) or activating (KAR) receptors expressed at
the surface of NK cells. Breast tumor cells expressing ULBP or
MICA/MICB markers that bind NKG2D on NK cells will
stimulate their IFN-g secretion (Supplementary Fig. S5; refs.
43, 44). However, expression of MHC class I (Supplementary
Fig. S7), a KIR ligand, by breast tumor cells reduced this IFN-g
secretion. In coculture of breast tumor cell lines with purified
monocytes, rhIFN-g could be omitted upon addition of NK
cells in conditions leading to their activation, that is, in the
presence of IL-2, K562 NK target cell line, or anti-MHC class I
Ab. All these culture conditions lead to IFN-g secretion
required for CCL22 production as shown by the use of blocking anti-IFN-gR Ab.
In this cell line, MICA (NKG2D-L) expression in breast
tumors has been associated with a poor prognosis (43). This
could result either from the production of soluble MICA that
blocks the killing function of NK cells or the impact of IFN-g
secretion by NK cells on Treg recruitment through CCL22
secretion by tumor cells. In the Lewis Lung carcinoma mouse
model, depletion of NK cells blocked CCL22 production in the
tumor environment; however, NK cells were proposed as the
major source of CCL22 (45). In contrast, we never detected, in

Innate Immune Recognition Triggers CCL22 by Breast Tumor Cells

our experimental set-up, CCL22 secretion by resting as well as
activated NK cells.
The replacement of purified monocytes/macrophages by
the combination of rhIL-1b and rhTNF-a in the culture of
breast tumor cells with rhIFN-g or NK cells strongly enhanced
the CCL22 production. This observation is in agreement with
previous publications on keratinocytes and colon epithelial
cell lines (16, 24), whereas blockade of IL-1b and TNF-a
abrogate this secretion in [PBMC/tumor cell] coculture. Interestingly, IFN-g increased IL-1R1 and TNF receptor on
tumor cell lines (data not shown), as previously described
(46), suggesting a potential amplification loop of CCL22
production. Taken together, these results suggest the importance of inflammation in the high CCL22 levels in the breast
tumor environment that will favor Treg recruitment leading to
reduced specific antitumor immune response. This is in
agreement with studies in colon tissue reporting the involvement of intestinal flora-mediated chronic inflammation in the
increased recruitment of Treg (for review, see ref. 47). This
suggests that inflammation in the mammary gland may
participate in the tumor development. In favor of this,
TNF-a secretion by leukocytes infiltrating tumors strongly
contributes to mammary carcinogenesis in murine mammary
models (48). Importantly, the in situ analyses on primary
breast tumors allow us to show the presence of NK cells
and macrophages in the vicinity of tumor cells.
Treg have been described to reduce NK cell cytotoxicity (for
review, see ref. 49) suggesting that CCL22 production by tumor

cells inducing Treg recruitment represents one of the mechanisms elaborated by tumors to avoid its destruction through NK
cell cytotoxicity.
Taken together, our results allow us to propose a model in
which mammary epithelial cell transformation processes favored activation of NK cells present in the breast tissue by
reducing KIR and inducing KAR ligand expression and their
subsequent IFN-g secretion, leading to the production of
TNF-a and IL-1b by resident monocytes/macrophages. Acting
together, these 3 cytokines will favor CCL22 overproduction by
tumor cells, allowing the recruitment of CCR4þ blood Treg that
favor the development of a tolerogenic environment.
