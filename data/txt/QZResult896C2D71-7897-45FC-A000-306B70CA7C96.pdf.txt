BACKGROUND: Standard intrathecal chemotherapy for lymphomatous meningitis (LM) is limited by the
short cerebrospinal half-lives of the agents used, necessitating frequent administration. Liposomal cytarabine (DepoCyte) has an extended half-life that permits administration at 2- to 4-weekly intervals. METHODS: Patients with LM who underwent treatment with liposomal cytarabine at treatment centers in Spain
between 2004 and 2007 were identified. Data on demographics, treatment, and outcomes were extracted
from medical notes and entered, retrospectively, into a database for analysis. RESULTS: Data on 55 patients
with lymphoma (mainly stage IV) and LM were entered into the database. Most patients (n ¼ 36) had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The median number of cycles of liposomal cytarabine received was 4 (range, 110), and the median follow-up period was 124 days. Complete and partial neurologic responses were
achieved in 27 and 12 patients, respectively (overall response rate, 72%), all of whom also showed a cytological response, except for 5 with initially negative cytology. Median time to neurologic progression
among responders was 105.5 days. Liposomal cytarabine was generally well tolerated; headache was the
most commonly reported adverse effect (n ¼ 17). CONCLUSIONS: Liposomal cytarabine is effective and
well tolerated in the treatment of LM, and should be considered as an agent of choice for the treatment of

Liposomal Cytarabine in LM/Garcia-Marco et al

Malignant infiltration of the leptomeninges (the pia
mater and arachnoid membranes) is a much-feared complication of lymphoma that is estimated to occur in
approximately 7% to 15% of patients.1 Prognosis is generally poor: without treatment, the median survival time
is 4 to 6 weeks.2 Even with current standards of care
(radiotherapy and/or intrathecal [IT] or systemic chemotherapy), median survival time is only 4 to 6 months.3
Symptoms and signs of lymphomatous meningitis
(LM) include headache, mental health changes, seizures,
sensory disturbances back/neck pain, and weakness; they
reflect involvement of the entire neuraxis.1 Treatment is
generally palliative, and the main objectives are to
improve survival, relieve symptoms, delay further neurologic deterioration, and maintain quality of life.
IT chemotherapy is 1 of the mainstays of treatment
for LM, but choice of agent is limited to methotrexate,
cytarabine, or thiotepa. A major problem with these
agents is that rapid clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) after injection necessitates administration 2 or 3
times a week, which is inconvenient for patients, presents
multiple opportunities for injection-related trauma or
infection, and is resource intensive. In recent years, a liposomal formulation of cytarabine (DepoCyte, Mundipharma Pharmaceuticals SL, Cambridge, UK) has been
developed that significantly increases the CSF half-life of
the drug.4 Liposomal cytarabine has allowed the frequency of administration to be reduced to once every 2
weeks during the induction and consolidation phases, and
once every 4 weeks during the maintenance phase.5
Patients being treated with liposomal cytarabine should
receive concomitant oral dexamethasone on Days 1 to 5
of each cycle, to reduce the risk of chemical arachnoiditis.
The efficacy and tolerability of IT liposomal cytarabine have been demonstrated in 2 randomized controlled
trials. In patients with neoplastic meningitis associated
with solid tumors, liposomal cytarabine was associated
with significant improvements in time to neurologic progression and quality-adjusted survival, compared with IT
methotrexate.6,7 In a second trial in patients with LM,
response rates were significantly higher among those
randomized to IT liposomal cytarabine than among those
receiving standard (nonliposomal) cytarabine (71% vs
15%; P ¼ .006).8
However, data on the clinical use of liposomal cytarabine for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS)

involvement in non-Hodgkin lymphoma remain scarce;
the 2 reports on the safety and efficacy of liposomal cytarabine mentioned above included only 35 and 28 patients,
respectively.6-8 We therefore present our experience on
the efficacy and safety of IT liposomal cytarabine in a
larger series of 55 Spanish patients with LM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used an online database to perform a noncomparative,
retrospective analysis of the effectiveness and tolerability
of liposomal cytarabine in the treatment of LM in Spain.
Patients with lymphoma who were diagnosed with LM
between February 2004 and July 2007 at 30 hemato-oncology centers in Spain, and who received at least 1 dose
of IT liposomal cytarabine, were eligible for inclusion in
the database. Diagnosis was based on clinical parameters,
and was confirmed using CSF cytology (in all but 3 cases),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (in 17), flow cytometry (in 2), or brain biopsy (in 1). There were no specific
exclusion criteria.
Data were retrieved from medical records on demographics (age and sex); disease characteristics (histology
and stage); previous and concurrent systemic and IT treatment; symptoms of LM; dosage of liposomal cytarabine
and number of cycles; treatment used to prevent chemical
arachnoiditis; side effects; response to liposomal cytarabine (neurologic and cytologic); time to neurologic progression; and change in Karnofsky score (improved,
worsened, or stabilized vs baseline, as assessed on the day
of the first liposomal cytarabine injection).
Neurologic response was defined as follows:
• Complete response (CR): disappearance of all neurologic symptoms
• Partial response (PR): disappearance of at least 50%
of neurologic symptoms for at least 2 weeks
• Stable disease (SD): no change in neurologic symptoms
• Progressive disease (PD): progression of neurologic
symptoms or appearance of new neurologic symptoms.
Cytologic response was assessed at the time of lumbar puncture for liposomal cytarabine. It was defined as:
• CR: absence of malignant cells in the CSF
• PR: reduction of at least 25% in the number of malignant cells in the CSF
1893

Original Article

• SD: no change in the number of malignant cells in
the CSF, or a reduction of <25%
• PD: an increase in the number of malignant cells in
the CSF.
Duration of follow-up was defined as the number of
days from the first dose of liposomal cytarabine to the
date of death or the last known clinical assessment. Time
to neurologic progression was measured from the first
injection of liposomal cytarabine until either neurologic
progression or death in patients with isolated CNS
involvement.

Patient Characteristics
Fifty-seven patients were screened for inclusion in the
database; 2 were excluded because of missing data. Details
for the remaining 55 patients were entered into the database, and their baseline characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. The most common histology was diffuse large Bcell lymphoma, accounting for 36 of 55 (65%) of the
patients, and most patients (35 of 55; 64%) had stage IV
disease at diagnosis. Three-quarters of the patients had de
novo CNS disease (n ¼ 42), and 13 experienced a relapse
of previously treated disease.
The most common symptom at diagnosis of LM
was headache (n ¼ 16); other symptoms reported in at
least 5 patients were diplopia (n ¼ 9), facial palsy (n ¼ 7),
paresthesias (n ¼ 8), and weakness (n ¼ 6). The diagnosis
of LM was confirmed by cytology in 51 patients and by
MRI in a further 3 patients; data were not available for 1
patient. Eighteen patients had isolated CNS involvement;
in the remaining 37 patients, it was also accompanied by a
systemic relapse.

Twenty-nine patients had received previous IT therapy for prophylaxis (in patients with de novo disease) or
treatment (in those with relapsed disease) of LM; 23 had
received triple IT therapy (methotrexate, cytarabine,
and a corticosteroid, usually hydrocortisone), and 1
patient had received dual IT therapy (methotrexate and
cytarabine). Three patients had received IT monotherapy with either methotrexate or cytarabine. The choice
of prior IT therapy was not documented in the remaining 2 patients.

Prior Treatment

Treatment for Lymphomatous Meningitis

Information on treatment history was available for 51
patients. All had received systemic chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy, with or without IT chemotherapy,
before their diagnosis of LM. The most commonly used
systemic regimen was CHOP (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone; n ¼ 30), with (n ¼ 21) or
without rituximab.

All patients received at least 1 cycle of IT liposomal cytarabine, defined as a single dose of 50 mg, except for 1
patient who received a dose of 25 mg in 2 cycles because
of chemical arachnoiditis. The median number of cycles
was 4 (range, 1-10). Among the 19 patients who received
at least 2 doses of liposomal cytarabine, and for whom
dates of administration were available, doses were

generally administered every 2 weeks for 2 to 6 doses, and
every 4 to 5 weeks thereafter. However, 2 patients received
at least 7 doses, all at 2-week intervals.
Fifty patients received corticosteroids for the prevention of chemical arachnoiditis; 1 patient received no prophylaxis, and data were missing in the remaining 4. The
most commonly used agent was dexamethasone (n ¼ 43;
usually 4 mg twice daily for 5 days with each cycle of liposomal cytarabine); 6 patients received prednisone at various doses, and 1 patient received methylprednisolone.
Details of concurrent systemic chemotherapy were
available for 53 of the 55 patients, of whom 8 did not
receive any. In the remaining 45, the most common regimens used were rituximab CHOP (R-CHOP) (n ¼ 17)
and methotrexate plus cytarabine (n ¼ 11), followed by
CHOP-like regimens (n ¼ 6), ESHAP (etoposide, methylprednisolone, cytarabine, cisplatin) (n ¼ 5), methotrexate alone (n ¼ 3), and alkylating agents plus purine
analogs (n ¼ 3). All chemotherapy was given concomitantly with liposomal cytarabine. In the 14 patients given
concomitant methotrexate (alone or with cytarabine), the
median methotrexate dose was 3000 mg/m2/cycle (range,
500-4000 mg/m2/cycle).
Concurrent radiotherapy was given in 10 patients,
but the date was available in only 3: it was given concomitantly in 2 patients, and sequentially in the third

Response to Treatment
At the time of analysis, 22 patients were alive, 31 were
known to have died, and 2 had been lost to follow-up.
The median duration of follow-up was 124 days (range,
7-899 days; n ¼ 50).
Neurologic responses were available for 54 patients
(Table 2); a neurologic CR was seen in 27 patients, and a

PR in a further 12 patients, giving an overall response rate
of 39 of 54 (72%). Eight patients had SD, whereas 7
patients had PD.
Table 3 shows detailed cytologic data for the 44
patients who showed a response of any kind, whether neurologic or cytologic, with baseline and lowest measured
cell counts in the CSF. Five of these had a cytologic
response only (4 SD, 1 PD on neurologic assessment). Of
the 39 patients with a neurologic response (CR or PR), all
had a cytological response, except for 5 with initially negative cytology, for whom it was inapplicable. The mean
(range) number of doses to achieve a cytologic response
(ie, a reduction in cell count of at least 25%) was 2.82 (16) overall: 2.81 (1-6) for those with a cytologic CR versus
2.83 (1-5) for those with a cytologic PR.
Quality of Life Data
In the 53 patients for whom Karnofsky scores were available, the score was improved after treatment in 32 (60%),
unchanged in 14 (26%), and worse in 7 (13%). Time to
neurologic progression was available for 32 of the 39 neurologic responders; median time to neurologic progression was 105.5 days (range, 2-889 days).
Safety Data
Information on side effects was available for 54 patients.
Liposomal cytarabine was generally well tolerated, with
30 patients reporting no side effects from treatment.
Among the remaining 24, the most common side effects
were headache (n ¼ 17; grade 2 in 1 patient, grade 1 in 3
patients, and of undocumented grade in 13), nausea (n ¼
7; grade 1 in 1 patient, undocumented grade in 6), fever
(n ¼ 7; all undocumented grade), and vomiting (n ¼ 6;
grade 1 in 2 patients, undocumented grade in 4).

DISCUSSION
LM is a generally incurable complication of lymphoma
that occurs in a significant proportion of patients with
aggressive histologies of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The
disease often affects quality of life adversely during the
patient’s final months, and is associated with a short survival time. Any new intervention that has the potential to
improve outcomes is thus to be welcomed.9
When planning therapy in a palliative care setting,
the negative impact of invasive or poorly tolerated healthcare interventions on quality of life must be taken into
account. Traditionally, IT chemotherapy for LM has
entailed 2 or 3 injections a week, either by lumbar puncture or via an implanted Ommaya reservoir; these administration schedules are inconvenient, time-consuming,
and resource intensive, not only for patients, but also for
their carers and for healthcare systems. Moreover, the use
of reservoirs is associated with additional costs arising
from surgical placement and perioperative care, and carries a significant risk of CNS infections that may further
complicate patient management.9
In this context, IT liposomal cytarabine is a valuable
addition to the available treatment options for LM. A conservative interpretation of data from randomized clinical
trials conducted to date would be that IT liposomal cytarabine is at least as effective as IT methotrexate or cytarabine in patients with leptomeningeal metastases.7,8
Perhaps equally important, the reduction in injection frequency with liposomal cytarabine is beneficial to patients,
their families, and healthcare providers. Cole et al6 found
that, compared with those receiving IT methotrexate,
patients receiving liposomal cytarabine experienced 44 to
79 additional days of quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (P < .05).
We have described the efficacy and tolerability of
liposomal cytarabine in a clinical series of 55 patients
treated for LM at 30 treatment centers in Spain. These
cases provide further support for the feasibility, efficacy,
safety, and tolerability of liposomal cytarabine in this setting, with most patients (72%) achieving neurologic
responses, accompanied by a cytologic response in the
great majority. When present, a cytologic response was
Cancer

May 1, 2009

generally seen after 2 to 3 doses of liposomal cytarabine,
although as many as 5 or 6 were needed in some cases, and
further dosing may affect the duration for which a
response is sustained. However, the significance of a lymphocyte population in the CSF is not always clear from
conventional cytology; in the few cases where flow cytometry was available, there was no evidence of lymphocyte
clonality. This may explain why some patients had a neurologic CR while retaining some reactive nonclonal lymphocytes in their CSF. We recommend the use of flow
cytometry, both at diagnosis and at subsequent lumbar
puncture, in future studies. Treatment was generally well
tolerated: most of our patients did not experience treatment-related toxicity. Among those who did, headache
was the most common adverse effect.
Concerns have recently been expressed that there
might be an increased risk of severe neurotoxicity in
patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving IT
liposomal cytarabine and either high-dose systemic methotrexate or nonliposomal cytarabine.10,11 None of the
patients in our series who received concurrent liposomal
cytarabine and high-dose methotrexate experienced serious neurologic sequelae. Although this finding is encouraging, more work is needed to better define the risks
associated with combined high-dose systemic and IT
chemotherapy in this patient group.
These data have limitations. First, the study is an
open-label, noncomparative, retrospective assessment of
outcomes among unselected, consecutive patients receiving liposomal cytarabine in the clinical practice setting.
The data cannot therefore be expected to be of the same
quality as those generated in a prospective, randomized,
controlled clinical trial, and concomitant use of centrally
active doses of systemic cytotoxic agents could also explain
some of the observed results. In addition, the retrospective
method of data collection meant that values were missing
for key variables in some patients. Finally, as noted above,
flow cytometry would have been a superior means of
assessing cytologic responses, but was unavailable in the
great majority of cases.
Nonetheless, the data presented here do support the
use of IT liposomal cytarabine in the treatment of LM.
More patients are included in this series than in previously
published randomized clinical trials of liposomal cytarabine. The encouraging efficacy and tolerability of the
agent, and its convenient administration schedule, suggest
