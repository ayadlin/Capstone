ABSTRACT
Oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP150) is an inducible ER chaperone by
numerous cellular insults and sustains cellular viability. We have previously reported
that ORP150 is differentially induced in a panel thyroid cancer cells and represents
as an unwanted molecular consequence during exposure to proteasome inhibition.
However, the molecular basis for induction of ORP150 by proteasome inhibitors in
thyroid cancer cells remains unclear. In the current study, we found that -421/-307
and -243/+53 regions at the ORP150 gene were responsible for its transactivation by
MG132 in thyroid cancer cells. Nrf2 directly transactivated the ORP150 gene by direct
binding with the -421/-307 region. Nrf2 also indirectly activated OPR150 transcription
via facilitating recruitment of ATF4 to the -243/+53 region. Collectively, this study
highlights the molecular mechanism by which proteasome inhibition stimulates
ORP150 expression via Nrf2 in thyroid cancer cells.

induction of CHOP, activation of the apoptosis signalregulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-c-Jun-N-terminal kinase
(JNK) pathway and cleavage of ER resident caspases
including caspase 12 (in rodent) and caspase 4 (in human)
[11]. Accumulating studies now support that ER stress
is implicated in the antitumor effects of proteasome
inhibitors [7, 19, 23, 24, 30].
ORP150 is induced by various stimuli including ER
stress, hypoxia, ischemia, glucose deprivation, reductive
reagents, and functions as a survival mechanism [2, 4,
12–14, 18, 21, 25, 28]. ORP150 is also increased in
various clinically isolated tumors and cancer cell lines
[20, 27, 29]. We have previously shown that proteasome
inhibition induces ORP150 expression in thyroid cancer
cells [8]. ORP150 induction mediated by proteasome
inhibitors is stronger in insensitive thyroid cancer cells
than in those sensitive cells. In addition, suppression
of ORP150 induction augments apoptotic cell death of
thyroid cancer cells mediated by proteasome inhibitors
[8], suggesting that ORP150 represents as an antiapoptotic

INTRODUCTION
Proteasome inhibitors possess anti-tumor activity
against hematologic malignancies and solid tumors [1].
Proteasome inhibition may lead to the accumulation of
misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
lumen resulting in ER stress response, a process involving
three ER transmembrane proteins: protein-kinase and
site-specific endoribonuclease (IRE1), protein kinase
R-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription
factor (ATF) 6 [5]. ER stressors induce phosphorylation
of PERK and IRE1, which in turn lead to ATF4 activation
and XBP1 splicing, respectively [16]. ER stressors also
trigger cleavage of p90-ATF6 into p50-ATF6, which
translocates to the nucleus and activates the target
genes [32]. All ATF4, XBP1 and p50-ATF6 specifically
activate transcription of ER stress response-related genes
containing ER stress response element (ERSE) [17]. The
ER-mediated apoptotic pathway is also triggered by ER
stress, which leads to proapoptotic responses including

factor during treatment with proteasome inhibitors.
However, the mechanism(s) underlying preferential
induction of ORP150 in insensitive thyroid cancer cells
remains unclear. We have previously demonstrated
that proteasome inhibitors primarily activate CHOP
transcription via ATF4 binding to the CHOP promoter,
while Nrf2 suppresses CHOP induction by precluding the
recruitment of ATF4 to the CHOP promoter [33]. Since
the competitive induction of CHOP and ORP150, in the
current study, we explored the possible involvement of
Nrf2 in induction of ORP150 by proteasome inhibitors in
thyroid cancer cells.

against Nrf2 (siNrf2) was then used to suppress the
expression of Nrf2 in 8305C cells. siNrf2 successfully
inhibited MG132-mediated accumulation of Nrf2,
while scramble siRNA had no obvious effect (Figure
2B). Importantly, siNrf2 significantly blocked induction
of ORP150 mRNA (Figure 2C) and protein (Figure
2B) expression induced by MG132. To investigate the
regulatory site(s) of Nrf2, siNrf2 was then cotransfected
with pORP150(-421/+53)-Luc and pORP150(-243/+53)Luc, respectively. Compared with scramble siRNA,
siNrf2 significantly decreased luciferase activities of both
pORP150(-421/+53)-Luc and pORP150(-243/+53)-Luc
reporters (Figure 2D). Notably, pORP150(-421/+53)-Luc
and pORP150(-243/+53)-Luc reporters demonstrated
similar transactivation activities in the presence of siNrf2
(Figure 2D), indicating that Nrf2 might be responsible for
transactivation of the ORP150 gene by MG132 at both
-243/+53 and -421/-307 regions.

RESULTS
Mapping the MG132-responsive elements at
-243/+53 and -421/-307 region of the ORP150
gene promoter in 8305C cells

Direct transactivation of ORP150 gene at -421/307 region by Nrf2

To examine whether transactivation of the
ORP150 gene might lead to its induction by MG132 in
thyroid cancer 8305C cells, we used a reporter construct
containing -1079 to +53 base pairs (bp) of the human
ORP150 promoter fused to luciferase (pORP150(1079/+53)-Luc). 8305C cells were chosen for the current
study, because they demonstrated the highest ORP150
induction by MG132 in a panel of thyroid cancer cell
lines [8]. MG132 caused about 15-fold induction of the
reporter gene activity in 8305C cell (Figure 1A). To
further map the regulatory elements by MG132, a series of
5′ truncations of the ORP150 promoter were constructed
(Figure 1B). MG132 caused about 8-fold induction of
pORP150(-243/+53)-Luc and pORP150(-306/+53)Luc reporters (Figure 1C). pORP150(-421/+53)-Luc,
pORP150(-613/+53)-Luc, pORP150(-837/+53)-Luc and
pORP150(-1079/+53)-Luc reporters demonstrated about
15-fold induction upon MG132 exposure (Figure 1C).
These data indicated that -243/+53 and -421/-307 regions
of the ORP150 gene might be responsible for its induction
by MG132.

To investigate whether Nrf2 interacts with the
-421/-307 and-243/+53 regions of ORP150 promoter in
vivo, ChIP analysis of 8305C cell extracts was performed
using Nrf2 antibodies and PCR primers targeting the 115bp and 297-bp DNA fragment, respectively. ChIP analysis
showed that the fragments at both -420/-307 and -243/+53
regions of the ORP150 promoter co-immunoprecipitated
with Nrf2 antibodies, which was enhanced by MG132
exposure (Figure 3A), indicating that Nrf2 is associated
with the upstream regulatory region of ORP150. To
test whether Nrf2 directly activates the reporter genes,
8305C cells were cotransfected with various mutant Nrf2
constructs with pORP150(-243/+53)-Luc or pORP150(421/+53)-Luc construct (Figure 3B). ΔNLS demonstrated
no influence on the activity of both reporter genes under
MG132 exposure (Figure 3C–3D), indicating that nuclear
localization is critical for transactivation of ORP150 by
Nrf2. WT, ΔNES and ΔNES/ΔTAD increased reporter
activity of pORP150(-243/+53)-Luc with similar extent
(Figure 3C), indicating that nuclear translocation was
sufficient for transactivation of the ORP150 gene at
-243/+53 region. However, when compared with WT
and ΔNES, ΔNES/ΔTAD mutant increased the reporter
activity of pORP150(-421/+53)-Luc with smaller extent
(Figure 3D), indicating that transactivation capacity of
Nrf2 is required for full activation of the reporter gene.
Collectively, these data indicated that Nrf2 directly
transactivated the ORP150 gene at-421/-307 region, while
indirectly transactivated the ORP150 gene at -243/+53
region.

Involvement of Nrf2 in transactivation of
ORP150 by MG132 at both -421/-307 and
-243/+53 regions
In silico promoter analysis (http://www.sabiosciences.
com) indicates that Nrf2 binding with the -340/-330
region of the ORP150 gene promoter. In addition, we
have previously reported that the Nrf2 expression levels
are involved in the responsiveness of thyroid cancer cells
to proteasome inhibition [6]. Therefore, we explored
the potential involvement of Nrf2 in ORP150 induction
mediated by MG132 in 8305C cells. Immunofluorescence
confirmed that 8305C cells inherently exhibited nuclear
Nrf2 expression, and MG132 treatment stimulated its
nuclear accumulation (Figure 2A). Specific siRNAs

MG132 increased recruitment of ATF4 to the -243/+53
region of the ORP150 gene promoter in 8305C cells
(Figure 4A). Transfection with specific siRNA against
(siATF4) significantly suppressed MG132-mediated
induction of ORP150 (Figure 4B). Knockdown of ATF4 by
siATF4 almost completely blocked binding of Nrf2 to the
-243/+53 region on the ORP150 promoter in 8305C cells,
while demonstrated no obvious influence on the binding of
Nrf2 to the -421/-307 region (Figure 4C), indicating that
binding of Nrf2 with -243/+53 region of the ORP150 gene
is indirect and ATF4 is indispensable for Nrf2 recruitment.
Duolink PLA confirmed endogenous binding between
ATF4 and Nrf2 in 8305C cells, which was enhanced by
MG132 exposure (Figure 4D). In addition, re-ChIP by
using ATF4 and Nrf2 antibodies sequentially demonstrated
that after the ATF4 first ChIP enrichment of Nrf2 binding
was observed in the ORP150 promoter at-243/+53 region
in 8305C cells (Figure 4E), indicating that Nrf2 and ATF4
were concurrently bound to the ORP150 promoter at this

region. On the contrary, Nrf2 binding was not observed in
the ORP150 promoter at -421/-307 region after the ATF4
first ChIP (Figure 4E). Importantly, Knockdown of Nrf2
expression by siNrf2 significantly decreased the binding
of ATF4 to the ERSE element on the ORP150 promoter
in 8305C cells (Figure 4F), indicating that Nrf2 might
stimulate the recruitment of ATF4 to the ORP150 promoter.

in thyroid cancer tissues
Real time RT-PCR demonstrated the significant
positive correlation between steady-state levels of
ORP150 and Nrf2 in extracts from thyroid cancer
tissues (Figure 5A). Consistent with mRNA expression
levels, Western blot confirmed expression of Nrf2 and

and Nrf2 concomitantly recruited to the -243/+53 region
of the ORP150 gene. In addition, knockdown of Nrf2
significantly decreased ATF4 recruitment to the-243/+53
region of the ORP150 gene, indicating that Nrf2 might
facilitate ATF4 recruitment to the OPR150 promoter via
direct interaction with ATF4.
Collectively, the current study demonstrated that
Nrf2 positively regulated ORP150 expression in thyroid
cancer. Nrf2 acts as a direct transcriptional activator at
the -421/-307 region of ORP 150 promoter, Nrf2 also
facilitates the binding of ATF4 to the -243/+53 region
of ORP150 promoter (Figure 6). This report provides a
comprehensive analysis of the regulation of ORP150 by
Nrf2 in thyroid cancer.

DISCUSSION
ORP150 is an inducible ER chaperone molecule
that is increased by various stimuli including hypoxia,
serum starvation, ischemia, ER stressors and proteasome
inhibitors [2, 4, 8, 12–14, 18, 21, 25]. ORP150 is also
increased to provide anti-apoptotic signals in a variety
of cancers [3, 8, 20, 22, 25, 27, 29]. Although various
ER stressors have been reported to induce ORP150, the
underlying molecular mechanism has remained unclear.
The only available information is that a 9-bp sequence
located on the ORP150 promoter region is almost
identical to that of the ERSE with only 1-bp mismatch,
to which p50-ATF6 specifically binds and activates its
transcription [10].
The current study mapped two regulatory regions
located at-421/-307 and -243/+53 of the ORP150
promoter responsible for its induction by MG132 in
8305C cells. In silico promoter analysis demonstrated
that one ERSE and a potential Nrf2 binding site located
at -197/-191 and -340/-330 of the ORP150 promoter,
respectively. The current study demonstrated that Nrf2
was responsible for ORP150 induction at both -421/307 and -243/+53 regions of its gene. Knockdown of
Nrf2 expression decreased, while forced overexpression
of Nrf2 enhanced ORP150 induction in 8305C cells.
These data indicated that Nrf2 positively regulated
ORP150 expression in thyroid cancer cells. The positive
correlation between Nrf2 and ORP150 in human thyroid
cancer tissues further confirmed regulation of ORP150
by Nrf2. Experiments using Nrf2 mutants demonstrated
that Nrf2 directly activated ORP150 transcription at the
-421/-307 region of the ORP150 promoter. However, Nrf2
might not transcriptionally activate ORP150 directly, as
Nrf2 mutant lack of transactivation domain increased the
pORP150(-243/+53)-Luc reporter gene activity. ATF4

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Culture of thyroid cancer cells
8305C cells were obtained from the European
Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. The earliest passage of
the cell line received in our laboratories was DNA profiled
using the Applied Biosystems Profiler Plus kit (ABI,
Foster, CA). Consistent with the previous report [26], the
STR profile of the cell line was consistent with its profile
in the DSMZ database (http://www.dsmz.de/). 8305C cells
were maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis,
MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO).

Chemicals
MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem. 0.02%
DMSO was used as vehicle control.

RNA isolation and real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)
RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR were performed
as previously reported [30]. For ORP150, the forward
primer was 5′-GTGCTGCAGCTCATCAATGAC-3′ and
reverse was 5′-ATCTGCAGCTGTGGCTGCATC-3′,
the amplicon size was 188 base pair (bp). For ATF4, the

forward primer was 5′-TGACCTGGAAACCATGCCAG-3′
and 5′-AATGATCTGGAGTGGAGGAC-3′, the amplicon
size was 221 bp. For β-actin, the forward primer was
5′-GAGACCTTCAACACCCCAGCC-3′ and the re
erse
was
5′-GGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCAG-3′,
the amplicon size was 205 bp. All the reactions were
performed in triplicate, and the standard method was
used for the quantification of the expression for each
segment. The expression of targeted genes were expressed
as arbitrary units, which was normalized by use of β-actin
as a normalization control gene. All the reactions were
done with a negative control to ensure that we had no
contamination.

ORP150 sequence between -243/+53 (forward:
5′-CAGCAAAGCATCCAGCGC-3′ and reverse: 5′-GCG
CGCTCATTGGAGCCTC). The immunoprecipitation/
input ratio of the untreated sample was considered as
100% and the immunoprecipitation/input ratio of the
MG132 treated sample was expressed as a percentage of
the untreated.

Construction of Nrf2 plasmids and cell
transfection
A cDNA encoding human Nrf2 was generated by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human brain cDNA
library (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and subcloned into the
eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA3-Flag. Nrf2-ΔNLS
(nuclear localization signal), Nrf2-ΔNES (nuclear export
signal), and Nrf2-ΔNES/ΔTAD (transactivation domain)
mutants were generated as previously reported [9]. The
constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cells were
transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) as instructed by the supplier.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl,
150mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100 and protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). Cell
extract protein amounts were quantified using the BCA
protein assay kit. Equivalent amounts of protein (25μg)
were separated using 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to
PVDF membrane (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA).

Generation of ORP150 promoter luciferase
constructs and luciferase assay

Proximity ligation assay (PLA)
Duolink in situ proximity ligation assay was
performed according to the manufacturer′s protocol
(Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). PLA probes were
diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS/1% fetal calf serum
and incubated in a pre-heated humidity chamber for 1 h at
37°C, followed by hybridization, ligation, amplification,
and detection. Fluorescence was visualized under a
confocal microscopy (TCS SP5 Leica Microsystems).

The 5′-flanking region of human ORP150 genomic
DNA between -1079 and +53 (+1 represents the
transcription start site) was amplified by PCR from HEK293
genomic DNA and subcloned into the reporter plasmid
pGL4 (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate pORP150(1079/+53)-Luc. Serial truncated reporter genes were
generated from pORP150(-1079/+53)-Luc by a polymerase
chain reaction-based method. Cells were transfected with
one of luciferase reporter constructs and pGL4.74 [hRluc/
TK] (Renilla luciferase internal control) plasmid (Promega,
Madison, WI). The firefly and renilla luciferase activities
were determined using the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter
Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI), according to the
manufacturer′s instructions. All transfection experiments
were repeated for three times in triplicate. The result was
expressed as relative luciferase activity.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
The siRNA sequences used here were as
follows: siRNA against Nrf2 (siNrf2), AAGAGUAUG
AGCUGGAAAAAC; siRNA against ATF4 (siATF4),
CCAGAUCAUUCCUUUAGUUUA. The scramble
nonsense siRNA (scramble; CCGUAUCGUAAG
CAGUACU) that has no homology to any known
genes was used as control. Transfection of siRNA
oligonucleotide was performed with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA ) according to the
manufacturer′s recommendations.

Immunohistochemistry
Specimens from normal and pathological human
thyroid tissues were isolated and immunohistochemistry
was performed as previously reported [15].

Chromosomal immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assay

Statistics
The statistical significance of the difference
was analyzed by ANOVA and post hoc Dunnett′s test.
Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05. All
experiments were repeated three times, and data were
