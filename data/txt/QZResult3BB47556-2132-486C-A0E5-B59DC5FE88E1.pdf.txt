Mammary Tumor Regression Elicited by Wnt Signaling
Inhibitor Requires IGFBP5

Abstract
Wnt ligand–driven tumor growth is inhibited by the soluble Wnt inhibitor Fzd8CRD, but the mechanism
through which this effect is mediated is unknown. In the MMTV-Wnt1 mouse model, regression of mammary
tumors by Fzd8CRD treatment coincides with an acute and strong induction of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)–
binding protein IGFBP5, an antagonist of IGF signaling that mediates involution of mammary gland in females
after offspring are weaned. In this study, we show that repression of this IGF inhibitory pathway is crucial for Wntdriven growth of mammary tumors. We found that IGFBP5 regulation was mediated by the b-catenin–dependent
Wnt pathway. Wnt, in addition to IGF ligands, facilitated tumor growth by paracrine communication among
tumor cells. In addition, Fzd8CRD caused precocious induction of IGFBP5 in normal mammary glands
undergoing involution, implying an acceleration of the involution process by inhibition of Wnt signaling. The
molecular and phenotypic parallel between tumor regression and mammary gland involution suggests that Wntdriven mammary tumors use the same growth mechanism as proliferating normal mammary glands. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Wnt signaling is an evolutionary conserved pathway that is
crucial for developmental processes, stem cell maintenance,
and cell fate determination. Misregulation of the Wnt pathway
is implicated in various human diseases, particularly in cancers
in which hyperactivation of the b-catenin–dependent canonical pathway is involved. Mammalian Wnt ligand was originally
identiﬁed as a protooncogene in viral induced mouse mammary gland tumors; overexpression of Wnt1 ligand under the
control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter leads to hyperplasia and, ultimately, adenocarcinoma in the
mammary gland (1). MMTV-Wnt1 tumors have characteristic
histologic features and are composed of a variety of cell types,
including distinct tumor luminal epithelial and basal/myoepithelial cells and host-derived stroma cells (2). Importantly,
the existence of basal/myoepithelial cells in Wnt tumors is
reminiscent of human basal–like breast cancers (3), which are
often associated with a poor prognosis and the lack of effective
treatment. A recent report also showed that Wnt signaling
activation is enriched in basal-like breast cancers (4). There-

fore, the MMTV-Wnt1 tumor is a useful model for studying
breast cancer tumorigenesis as well as for therapeutic evaluation (1). Disruption of Wnt signaling by administration of a
soluble frizzled8 receptor-immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc fusion
protein (Fzd8CRD) that competes for Wnt1 binding results in
regression of the tumors (5, 6).
While examining the events following inhibition of Wnt
activity in established MMTV-Wnt1 tumors, we found that
the rapid regression of Wnt1 mammary tumors caused by
Fzd8CRD treatment coincided with acute and strong induction of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-binding protein 5
(IGFBP5). IGFBP5 is a member of IGF-binding proteins
(IGFBPs) and a key regulatory molecule during mammary
gland involution (7). IGFBP5 is expressed throughout the
mammary epithelium during puberty, but greatly reduced
during lactation, and reexpressed during early mammary gland
involution before the onset of epithelial apoptosis (8). Overexpression of IGFBP5 results in an increase in apoptotic cells in
the mammary glands, whereas mice with mutant IGFBP5
exhibit a decrease in apoptotic cells and a delay in mammary
gland involution (8, 9). The predominant role of IGFBP5 in
these processes is to bind IGF ligand and inhibit its signaling,
but the functions independent of IGF signaling have also been
reported (8, 10). IGF is a known growth and survival factor in
mammary epithelial cells, and hyperactive IGF signaling is
found in various human tumors including breast cancer (11,
12). IGF signaling employs 2 ligands, IGF-I and IGF-II, that can
bind to IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) to activate downstream intracellular signaling pathways, providing cells with mitogenic and
antiapoptotic signals.
Wnt signaling also plays an important role in normal
mammary gland development. Although the exact role of Wnt

Wnt Signaling Inhibitor Induces IGFBP5 in Mammary Tumor

signaling in postnatal mammary development is not well
understood, there is evidence to suggest that Wnt signaling
provides growth/survival stimulus for the mammary epithelial
cells during the late stages of pregnancy. Inhibition of Wnt
signaling increases apoptosis in mammary glands of late
pregnant and lactating mice (13, 14), whereas activation of
the pathway delays mammary gland involution, presumably by
hindering apoptotic events (15). Thus, the survival stimuli
provided by Wnt signaling during normal mammary gland
development and in established Wnt1 tumors may have some
similarities. By studying the mechanism of Wnt inhibitory
molecule, we uncovered the analogy of growth/survival mechanism in Wnt1 tumors, human basal–like breast cancer, and
involuting mammary glands facilitated by IGFBP5.

Materials and Methods
Mice and allograft tumors
All mouse tumors are passaged as described previously (2).
All experimental protocols using mice were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Genentech
Inc.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunoﬂuorescence staining was conducted on formalinﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tumor sections (2). For image analysis, SlideBook software was used to measure pixel intensities
and calculated as previously described (16). Five random areas
per section from 3 separate sections for each treatment group
were analyzed.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Real-time PCR was carried out by TaqMan reaction as
previously described (2). All the primers used in this study
were listed in the Supplementary Methods.
IGF1R-blocking antibody and recombinant IGFBP5
IGF1R-blocking antibody was derived from phage library
screening against human IGF1R protein. The antibody exhibits
partial activity against the mouse receptor, as shown by the
inhibition of IGF1R phosphorylation in NMuMG cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Escherichia Coli derived recombinant
IGFBP5 protein was purchased from BioVision. IGFBP5human IgG Fc fusion protein (IGFBP5-Fc) was expressed and
puriﬁed from Chinese hamster ovary cells; the inhibitory
activity of IGFBP5 to IGF-I and IGF-II in MCF7 cells was
veriﬁed in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Treatment of mice and doses
Dissociated tumor cells (0.5  106) were resuspended in
HBSS:Matrigel (1:1) and injected into the #3 mammary fat pads
of 8- to 12-week-old NCR-nude mice. Fzd8CRD protein (10 mg/
kg) was given by intraperitoneal injections. Anti-HSV glycoprotein D (gD) monoclonal antibody 5B6 was used as an
irreverent control (17). Anti-LRP6 (30 mg/kg; ref. 18) or antigD was given by intraperitoneal injections. Recombinant
human IGF-I (10 mg/kg) was given by intraperitoneal injections twice per week. Picropodophyllin (PPP; 30 mg/kg; ref. 19)

www.aacrjournals.org

was dissolved in vehicle [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
vegetable oil (9:1)] and given by intraperitoneal injections.
Anti-IGF1R (20 mg/kg) was given by intraperitoneal injections
twice per week. Recombinant IGFBP5 was injected intratumorally (10 mg/kg), and the injection was repeated 2 days
following the ﬁrst injection.
shRNA knockdown of IGFBP5 in Wnt1 tumor cells
Wnt1 tumor cells were plated on collagen I–coated plates
(BD Bioscience) in mouse mammary epithelial cell culture
media (Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were infected with
lentivirus expressing puromycin and shRNA to IGFBP5
or to GFP (Sigma-Aldrich; NM_010518.1-1285s1c1 and
NM_010518.1-1530s1c1) at multiplicity of infection of 2.5 in
media containing 8 mg/mL of polybrene. Infected cells were
selected in medium containing 4 mg/mL of puromycin for 3
days. Puromycin-resistant cells were resuspended in HBSS:
Matrigel (1:1) and injected into the mammary fat pads of nude
mice (0.5  106 cells per mouse).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting isolation of different
types of cells in Wnt1 tumor
Cell dissociation method is previously described (2) and in
the Supplementary Fig. S5A. P-cadherin and EpCAM antibodies were used for separating luminal and basal/myoepithelial
cells.
In vitro experiments of human breast cancer cell lines
All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection. MDA-MB-468 and HCC38 cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640/10% FBS containing Wnt3A (100 ng/mL; R&D
systems) or Fzd8CRD (20 mg/mL). For b-catenin siRNA transfection, plated cells were transfected with 20 nmol/L of siRNA
(Dharmacon) by using DharmaFECT transfection reagent.
Wnt3A or Fzd8CRD treatment was done 48 hours after the
transfection.
Fzd8CRD treatment of pregnant mice
Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were injected with Fzd8CRD (20
mg/kg) or PBS at days 9, 12, and 16 of pregnancy. Mammary
glands were harvested at day 17 of pregnancy, immediate
postpartum (lactating), and at 6, 12, and 24 hours after weaning
(involution). The time from last Fzd8CRD injection to collection of last mammary gland sample was 3 days.
Statistical analysis
Two-tailed paired Student t test was calculated by Excel
software. Prism software was used for one or 2-way ANOVA.

Results
Wnt inhibitor rapidly triggers regression of MMTV-Wnt1
tumors
Fzd8CRD is a fusion protein of extracellular cysteine-rich
domain (CRD) of Frizzled8 receptor and human IgG Fc domain
(5). Fzd8CRD inhibits Wnt signaling and has been shown to
inhibit Wnt tumor growth in vivo (5). Notably, a single injection
of Fzd8CRD (10 mg/kg) resulted in a rapid decrease in the

volumes of MMTV-Wnt1 tumor (Fig. 1A). The same treatment
had no effect on the MMTV-DN–b-catenin (15) or MMTV-Her2
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1). Assessment of cell proliferation by anti-Ki67 staining of Wnt1 tumor sections (Fig. 1A)
revealed an abundance of Ki67þ cells in PBS-treated controls,
but the number of Ki67þ cells was dramatically reduced
at 24 hours after Fzd8CRD treatment and declined further
48 hours posttreatment (Fig. 1B). The decrease in cell proliferation following Fzd8CRD treatment was accompanied by an
increase in cells undergoing apoptosis, as determined by
activated caspase 3 antibody staining (Fig. 1A). Western blot
analysis of Wnt1 tumors also conﬁrmed an increase in activated caspase 3 levels following 24- and 48-hour post-Fzd8CRD
treatment (Fig. 1C).
Inhibition of Wnt signaling results in an immediate
induction of IGFBP5 in the Wnt1 tumors
To understand the striking effect of Wnt signaling inhibition
in vivo, we examined the gene expression changes in Wnt1
tumors that were treated with either Fzd8CRD or PBS. We

found IGFBP5 mRNA to be consistently and strongly upregulated in tumor samples treated with Fzd8CRD. By quantitative
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), we detected a 2-fold
increase in IGFBP5 transcript level compared with controls as
early as 5 hours post-Fzd8CRD treatment, with a further
elevation noted at 12 and 24 hours post-Fzd8CRD treatment
(Fig. 2A). The increase in IGFBP5 transcript coincided with a
decrease in Wnt signaling, as determined by the levels of the
Wnt-responsive gene transcripts, Axin2 and MMP7 (20, 21).
These changes were not seen in Fzd8CRD-treated DN–b-catenin and Her2 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The levels of
other IGFBPs were not changed following Fzd8CRD treatment,
with an exception of a smaller increase in IGFBP6 transcripts
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). Western blot revealed a signiﬁcant
elevation in IGFBP5 in Wnt tumors following 24 and 48 hours of
Fzd8CRD treatment compared with PBS (Fig. 2B), but not in
DN–b-catenin or Her2 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
To address whether the effect of Fzd8CRD is on canonical or
noncanonical Wnt signaling, we tested an antagonistic antibody against LRP6, the Wnt coreceptor that is thought to

function only in canonical signaling. Monoclonal LRP6 antibody (clone YW210.09) was derived from human synthetic
antibody phage libraries using recombinant human LRP6
protein. This antibody blocks the binding of Wnt1 to LRP6,
thereby promoting the rapid regression of Wnt1 tumors (18).
Similar to Fzd8CRD, anti-LRP6 also increased the IGFBP5
transcript and protein levels in Wnt1 tumors compared with
control antibody-treated tumors (Fig 2C and Supplementary
Fig. S2D), showing that disruption of canonical Wnt signaling is
sufﬁcient to increase IGFBP5 levels.
Because IGFBP5 is known as a negative regulator of IGF
signaling, an increase in IGFBP5 expression following
Fzd8CRD treatment may lead to a decline in IGF signaling
in the Wnt1 tumors. We monitored phosphorylation of IGF1R
in the Wnt1 tumors after Fzd8CRD treatment using anti–
phospho-IGF1R (Y1161). The cells stained with phospho-

IGF1R in Wnt tumor seemed to be in localized areas. In
Fzd8CRD-treated tumors, we detected less phospho-IGF1R–
stained regions compared with PBS-treated tumors (Fig. 2D).
Because anti–phospho-IGF1R was shown to cross-react with
phosphoinsulin receptor (Y1185), we immunoprecipitated
total IGF1R from tumor lysates using IGF1R-speciﬁc antibody
and analyzed the levels of phosphorylated IGF1R by anti–
phosphotyrosine. We detected less phosphorylated IGF1R in
Fzd8CRD-treated tumors compared with the control tumors
(Fig. 2E). These results indicated that IGFBP5 induction upon
Fzd8CRD may lead to the reduction of IGF signaling in the Wnt
tumor.
Attenuating IGF signaling inhibits Wnt1 tumor growth
The reduction of IGF signaling in the Wnt1 tumors following
Fzd8CRD treatment prompted us to assess the direct

10 mg/kg into the Wnt1 tumor site resulted in a slight
reduction in the tumor volume by day one postinjection, and
the average tumor volume continued to decrease more significantly on day 2, approximately by 23% of the original volume
(Fig. 3D). Similar levels of tumor regression were seen when we
injected IGFBP5 puriﬁed from E. coli.

contribution of IGF activity on the growth/survival of Wnt1
tumors. Accordingly, we injected Wnt1 tumor–bearing mice
with an IGF1R inhibitor, PPP. Although the precise mechanism
of action is not known, PPP was shown to selectively inhibit
IGF1R tyrosine kinase activity without affecting insulin receptor (19). The other mechanisms such as downregulating IGF1R
protein are also proposed (22). With a single injection of PPP at
30 mg/kg, the average tumor volume was reduced by 31% on
the next day and continued to regress to a maximum of 42%
reduction (Fig. 3A). The same treatment had no effect on Her2
tumors. We detected activated caspase 3 in the Wnt1 tumor
lysates from mice treated with PPP, but not in the tumor lysates
from vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 3B). IGFBP5 protein level was
not affected by the PPP treatment (Fig. 3B).
We employed an additional approach to inhibit IGF1R using
a functional blocking antibody. Monoclonal IGF1R antibody
(Clone YW 95.6) was derived from human antibody phage
library, screened against recombinant human IGF1R ectodomain. The moderate inhibitory effect was observed on IGF1R
phosphorylation in normal mouse mammary epithelial cell line
NMuMG (Supplementary Fig. S3). Injection of IGF1R antibody
at 20 mg/kg, twice per week, resulted in a signiﬁcant inhibition
of Wnt1 tumor growth compared with that of the anti-gD–
treated group (Fig 3C). By contrast, IGF1R antibody treatment
had no signiﬁcant effect on Her2 tumor growth.
Because inhibition of IGF signaling upon Fzd8CRD treatment is correlated with an increase in IGFBP5 expression, we
tested whether IGFBP5 alone is sufﬁcient to induce regression
of Wnt1 tumors in vivo. The ﬁrst injection of IGFBP5-Fc at

Induction of IGFBP5 expression is required for
regression of Wnt1 tumors upon Fzd8CRD treatment
Our data suggested that Wnt1 tumors rely upon IGF signaling and that Fzd8CRD promotes tumor regression by
interfering with this activity through induction of IGFBP5.
This model predicted that a failure to induce IGFBP5 would
abrogate tumor regression by Fzd8CRD. To directly address
this, we employed lentivirus expressing short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) to knockdown the expression of IGFBP5 (ShIGFBP5)
in Wnt1 tumor cells. The basal levels of IGFBP5 were slightly
decreased in the ShIGFBP5-infected tumors compared with
the tumors derived from ShGFP-infected cells. When tumorbearing mice were treated with Fzd8CRD, the tumors derived
from ShIGFBP5-infected cells were greatly impaired in their
ability to upregulate IGFBP5 expression compared with control tumors (Fig. 4A). More importantly, this impairment in
IGFBP5 expression was accompanied by a failure of Wnt1
tumors to undergo regression upon Fzd8CRD treatment
(Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. S4B). Lack of tumor regression
was also consistent with the decreased levels of activated
caspase 3 in Fzd8CRD-treated ShIGFBP5-infected tumors relative to Fzd8CRD-treated ShGFP-infected tumors (Fig. 4C).

The expression of Wnt1 ligand was not affected by viral
infection of these tumor cells, and Wnt signaling in these
infected tumors were faithfully inhibited by Fzd8CRD treatment, as indicated by a reduction in Wnt-responsive transcripts, Axin2 and MMP7 (Fig. 4D). This showed that Wnt1
expression and inhibition of Wnt activity by Fzd8CRD is
unaffected by knocking down IGFBP5 expression, yet the
tumors fail to regress.
Paracrine effect of IGF and Wnt signaling in Wnt1
tumors
MMTV-Wnt1 tumors contain different types of stroma and
tumor epithelial cells which can be separated by ﬂuorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) using cell surface markers (ref. 2;
Supplementary Fig. S5A). Mainly, we isolated CD45þ hematopoietic and CD45 stroma cells and 2 distinct tumor epithelial
cells referred to as basal/myoepithelial and luminal cells.
Sorted epithelial cells have been characterized by the expression of cytokeratin isotypes (CK5 for basal/myoepithelial cells
and CK18 for luminal epithelial cells) and basal/myoepithelial
cell marker, P-cadherin and smooth muscle actin (2).
By examining the transcripts from these isolated cell populations, we found that IGF-I was predominantly expressed by
the tumor hematopoietic cells (CD45þ), and IGF-II was
expressed by the CD45 ﬁbroblasts enriched stromal cells
(Fig. 5A). In contrast, IGF1R transcripts and proteins were
highly expressed by the Wnt1 basal/myoepithelial cells compared with the luminal cells (Fig 5). To determine whether IGF

speciﬁcally enhances the growth/survival of basal/myoepithelial cells, we injected isolated tumor basal/myoepithelial or
luminal cells into nude mice (30,000 cells per mouse), then
treated with either IGF-I twice per week at 10 mg/kg. Injected
basal/myoepithelial cells developed tumors signiﬁcantly faster
with IGF-I treatment compared with bovine serum albumin
treatment, whereas IGF-I treatment had no effect on the
growth of luminal cells (Fig. 5C). When both basal/myoepithelial and luminal tumor cells were injected together, IGF-1
treatment also enhanced the tumor growth (Supplementary
Fig. S5B). In addition, the growth of isolated tumor basal/
myoepithelial cells in culture were slightly enhanced with IGF1, but not the luminal cells (Supplementary Fig. S5B and C).
These data suggested that stromal IGF selectively enhances the
growth/survival of Wnt1 tumor basal/myoepithelial cells in
which IGF1R is expressed.
When we examined the Wnt signaling activity in sorted cell
populations, we found that expression of Wnt1 was restricted
to the tumor luminal cells, whereas the expression of Wntresponsive genes, axin2 and MMP7, was higher in the tumor
myoepithelial cells (Fig. 5A). When Wnt1 activity was inhibited
by Fzd8CRD treatment, axin2 and MMP7 transcript levels were
signiﬁcantly reduced in the myoepithelial cells, and concurrently, IGFBP5 expression was dramatically increased in these
cells (Fig. 5D). Expression of IGF-I and IGF-II in the stroma was
not affected by the Fzd8CRD treatment. Consistent with these
in vivo data, isolated Wnt1 tumor myoepithelial cells cultured
in media containing Wnt3A suppressed IGFBP5 expression,

whereas cells cultured in media containing Fzd8CRD induced
IGFBP5 expression (Fig. 5E). This regulation of IGFBP5 expression by Wnt activity was not seen in isolated tumor luminal
cells. These data suggested that Wnt signaling suppresses
IGFBP5 expression in myoepithelial cells, and IGFBP5 expression is reinduced upon Fzd8CRD inhibition of Wnt signaling. It
seemed that both IGF and Wnt signaling involve different types
of cells coexisting in tumor in vivo.
Regulation of IGFBP5 by Wnt signaling in human basal–
like breast cancer cells
Wnt3A or Fzd8CRD treatment can only affect IGFBP5
expression in basal/myoepithelial cells, and this Wnt regulation of IGFBP5 expression is not seen in luminal cells (Fig. 5D
and E). When we examined Wnt signaling–responsive gene,
MMP7, and IGFBP5 expression in human breast cancer tissues
and cell lines in NCBI GEO database (23), accession GSE7904,
(24, 25); we found MMP7 expression was signiﬁcantly higher
(P ¼ 0.007) in the basal-like breast cancers than in nonbasal–
like cancers (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S6A). Coincidentally, IGFBP5 expression was signiﬁcantly lower in the basallike than in nonbasal–like cancers.

We further tested various basal-like breast cancer cell
lines for regulation of IGFBP5 by Wnt3A or Fzd8CRD.
We found that inducing Wnt signaling by Wnt3A in
MDA-MB-468, HCC38, and MDA-MB-157 cells resulted in
a decrease in IGFBP5 transcripts (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S6B). Conversely, inhibiting Wnt signaling by
Fzd8CRD increased IGFBP5 transcripts. We also detected
IGFBP5 protein in the culture media of these cells treated
with Fzd8CRD, but not in the media with other treatments
(Supplementary Fig. S6C). These ﬁndings suggested that
both human breast cancer cells and the mouse mammary
tumor share a similar mechanism of IGFBP5 regulation by
Wnt activity.
To further investigate whether the regulation of IGFBP5
expression by Wnt is depended on b-catenin, we suppressed
b-catenin expression using siRNA. MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with b-catenin siRNA can no longer suppress IGFBP5
expression upon Wnt3A treatment and further elevate IGFBP5
expression with Fzd8CRD treatments (Fig. 6C). Similar results
were obtained from HCC38 cells. These data suggested that
regulation of IGFBP5 expression by Wnt ligands is via a
b-catenin–dependent mechanism.

Inhibition of Wnt signaling accelerates induction of
IGFBP5 expression in normal mammary gland during
involution
Our ﬁnding that IGFBP5 is the key molecule during tumor
regression by Wnt inhibitor is reminiscent of the effects of
IGFBP5 on remodeling of the normal mammary gland during
involution (8, 9). It prompted us to determine whether Wnt
signaling inﬂuences the expression of IGFBP5 in the involuting
glands. Accordingly, we treated pregnant mice with Fzd8CRD
at days 9, 12, and 16 postcopulation. Upon inhibition of Wnt
signaling, as indicated by the decrease in Wnt target genes,
axin2, MMP7, and TROY (26) (Supplementary Fig. S7A), expression of IGFBP5 protein and mRNA was increased slightly in late
pregnant glands (day 17) but was undetectable in lactating
glands from both Fzd8CRD-treated and PBS control–treated
mice (Fig 7A and B). During early involution, induction of
IGFBP5 was easily detected as early as 6 hours postweaning in
Fzd8CRD-treated glands, but remained undetectable in PBStreated glands. At 24 hours postweaning, IGFBP5 was detected
in the PBS-treated glands, although at considerably lower
levels than that observed in Fzd8CRD-treated mice. The acceleration of IGFBP5 expression in the involuting glands suggested that inhibition of Wnt activity precedes reexpression of
IGFBP5 during this stage of mammary gland remodeling.
To assess the consequences of Wnt inhibition on cell survival, we stained mammary glands with antiactivated caspase
3. A few activated caspase 3þ cells were seen in glands from
Fzd8CRD-treated mice at day 17 pregnancy and lactation,
whereas glands from PBS-treated mice had no detectable
caspase 3þ cells (Fig. 7C and Supplementary Fig. S7B). During
early involution, at 12 and 24 hours of postweaning, signiﬁcantly more caspase 3þ cells were detected in glands of

Fzd8CRD-treated mice than in PBS-treated glands. These data
indicated the resemblance of Wnt tumor and normal mammary gland undergoing remodeling process.

Discussion
In studying potential mechanisms of action for the Wnt
inhibitor Fzd8CRD, we found the induction of IGFBP5 in Wnt
mammary tumors to be an immediate endogenous outcome of
inhibiting Wnt activity. We detected an acute increase in
IGFBP5 transcript and protein (Fig. 2A and B) coincided with
a decrease in IGF signaling following Fzd8CRD treatment of
Wnt tumors (Fig. 2D), suggesting a possible role of IGFBP5 to
inhibit IGF signaling in the tumors. Using various inhibitory
reagents, we showed that IGF signaling supports Wnt1 tumor
growth. Our IGFBP5 knockdown experiments show clearly that
the induction of IGFBP5 is required for Wnt1 tumor regression
in response to disruption of Wnt activity (Fig. 4).
We analyzed the signaling components and showed how
Wnt and IGF signaling pathways are orchestrated in the
various cell types in the tumors. Consistent with a previous
report (27), expression of Wnt1 transgene is predominantly
found in the luminal cells, whereas inhibition of Wnt activity
by Fzd8CRD speciﬁcally affects the basal/myoepithelial cells
(Fig. 5C, Supplementary Fig. S5). Mammary myoepithelial
cells have been shown to respond to Wnt signaling, and this
is likely due to the expression of LRP5/6 coreceptors in these
cells (28–30). We also found that the basal/myoepithelial cells
express IGF1R and that stromal cells express IGF ligands
(Fig. 5A and B), indicating paracrine IGF signaling in vivo.
Various studies suggest the connection between Wnt signaling and human basal–like breast cancers (3, 4). We also

noticed that human basal–like breast cancers show on average
higher levels of one of the Wnt signaling–responsive gene,
MMP7, and lower levels of IGFBP5 compared with nonbasal–
like cancers (Fig 6A and Supplementary Fig. S6A). We found
that some human basal breast cancer cell lines have a similar
regulation of IGFBP5 by Wnt activity to what we found in
the mouse Wnt1 tumors (Figs. 5D, 6B, and Supplementary
Fig. S5B). Although the precise mechanism has yet to be
determined, we showed that regulation of IGFBP5 expression
in human cells is dependent on the canonical Wnt signaling
effector b-catenin, consistent with the results from anti-LRP6
treatment of Wnt1 tumors (Fig. 2C, 6D, and Supplementary
Fig. S2D).
We found that IGFBP5 expression is dramatically induced
upon inhibition of Wnt signaling before the onset of tumor
regression, analogous to the phenomenon previously
described for IGFBP5 in contributing to mammary involution
(7). Therefore, we hypothesized that endogenous Wnt activity
suppresses IGFBP5 expression during normal mammary development and were able to show that inhibition of Wnt signaling

1576

Cancer Res; 72(6) March 15, 2012

in normal mammary glands undergoing early involution
induces precocious IGFBP5 expression and apoptosis (Fig.
7). This similarity in induction of IGFBP5 upon inhibition of
Wnt activity in the Wnt1 mammary tumors and in the normal
involuting glands suggests that regression of Wnt1 tumors uses
a similar mechanism to that used by normal glands undergoing
involution. Wnt1 tumors may still possess characteristics of
normal mammary glands, but with continuous Wnt activity,
the tumors remain in an aberrant developmental state that
resembles pregnant glands without undergoing involution.
In summary, we showed that IGFBP5 induction is a critical
response to inhibition of Wnt signaling in Wnt mammary
tumor, and this regulation of IGFBP5 by Wnt signaling is also
observed in human basal–like breast cancer cells. We also
showed striking similarities between Wnt1 tumors undergoing
regression upon FzdCRD8 treatment and involuting normal
mammary glands. Our data suggests that oncogenic transformation by Wnt is mediated by paracrine Wnt signaling in vivo,
with incorporating normal developmental signaling such as
IGF/IGFBP5. Wnt signaling is considered to be an attractive
