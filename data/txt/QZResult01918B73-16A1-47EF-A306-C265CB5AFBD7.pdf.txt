BACKGROUND. Cases of severe gastrointestinal toxicity were monitored prospectively during NSABP C-07, a randomized clinical trial of adjuvant therapy for
patients with stage II/III colon cancer.

METHODS. Patients were treated with weekly bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (FL; ‘‘Roswell Park Regimen’’) or the same regimen plus oxaliplatin (FLOX).

RESULTS. Of 1857 patients, 79 (4.3%) developed a syndrome of bowel wall injury
(BWI, small or large) characterized by hospitalization for the management of
severe diarrhea or dehydration and radiographic or endoscopic evidence of bowel
wall thickening or ulceration. Fifty-one (64.6%) of these adverse events occurred
in patients treated with FLOX and 28 (35.4%) in those treated with FL (P < .01).

tropenia with or without proven bacteremia occurred in 22 patients treated with
higher risk for BWI after treatment with FLOX (6.7%) versus treatment with FL
(2.9%, P < .01). Female patients had a higher incidence of BWI with FLOX (9.1%)
than with FL (3.9%, P < .01). Severe gastrointestinal toxicity usually occurred during the third or fourth week on the first cycle of therapy, required hospitalization,
and was managed with fluids, antidiarrheals, and antibiotics. There were 5 deaths
(0.3%) due to enteropathy, 2 related to ES and 3 related to both BWI and ES.
Seventy-one percent of patients resumed treatment with FL after recovery.

CONCLUSIONS. Patients treated with adjuvant FL should be closely monitored for
diarrhea and aggressively managed, especially if oxaliplatin has been added to
the regimen. Cancer 2007;110:1945–50.  2007 American Cancer Society.

treatment in patients with resected high-risk colon
cancer.1 Severe diarrhea associated with 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU)-containing chemotherapy regimens can occasionally result in prolonged hospitalization, limiting
both the duration and intensity of effective cancerdirected therapy.2,3
During the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project (NSABP) C-07 randomized clinical trial
comparing the ‘‘Roswell Park Regimen’’ of 5-FU and
leucovorin (FL) to the same regimen plus oxaliplatin
(FLOX) in patients with resected stage II and III colon
cancer, we became aware of a hitherto infrequently
recognized diarrheal syndrome occurring in both arms
of the study.4 This toxicity was characterized by severe
diarrhea or dehydration associated with bowel wall
injury (BWI, small or large) on radiographic imaging
studies or endoscopy. In response to these adverse
events, special reporting of grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was instituted for the duration of the
study. In this article we report our evaluation of BWI or
enteric sepsis (ES) in the 2 arms of the study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
NSABP C-07 was approved by local human investigations committees or institutional review boards in
accordance with assurances filed with and approved
by the Department of Health and Human Services.
Written informed consent was required for participation in the trial. Between February 2000 and November 2002, 2492 patients with resected stage II or III
colon cancer entered NSABP clinical trial C-07,
which compared 3 8-week cycles of FL (500 mg/m2
5-FU given by bolus injection plus 500 mg/m2 leucovorin given by 2-hour infusion intravenously
weekly for 6 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period)
or FLOX (FL plus oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 intravenously
over 2 hours on Weeks 1, 3, and 5 of each cycle).
Patients were eligible if they had undergone a curative resection within the previous 42 days with negative surgical margins for stage II (T3,4, N0, M0) or
stage III (any T, N1,2, M0) colon cancer that was 12
cm from the anal verge. Patients had to have adequate hepatic and renal function, performance status
0-2, postoperative granulocyte count 1500/mm3,
and platelet count 100,000/mm3. Those with more
than 1 synchronous primary or intestinal obstruction
but not free perforation were eligible.
Reports of adverse events were received by the
NSABP Biostatistical Center. Through weekly reviews
of reported toxicity, it became apparent that a cohort
of patients was developing similar GI adverse events.
In the fall of 2000, NSABP investigators were
instructed to report the following adverse events
from both arms of the trial in an expedited manner:

thickening of the bowel wall (arrow) in a patient with bowel wall injury.

Bowel Wall Injury (BWI): Hospitalization for the
management of diarrhea or dehydration, with radiographic or endoscopic evidence of bowel wall thickening or ulceration. An example of bowel wall
thickening on a computed tomography (CT) scan in
a patient receiving FL is shown in Figure 1. Enteric
Sepsis (ES): Grade 3 or greater diarrhea and grade 4
neutropenia with or without proven bacteremia.
Of the total population of patients participating
in NSABP C-07, 1857 patients (929 FL, 928 FLOX)
were included in this analysis. These were eligible
patients who were randomized on or after November
1 2000 and started treatment, coinciding with the
implementation of forms collecting data on BWI and
ES on both treatment arms prospectively.
NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (v. 2) were used to
grade diarrhea, neutropenia, and other toxicities. Rates
between the 2 treatment arms were compared using
the chi-square test. All reported P-values are 2-sided.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics of age, sex, and race were well
balanced between the 2 treatment arms (Table 1).
Women made up 43.9% of the study population.
Slightly more women received FLOX (46.2%) than FL
(41.7%). Of the patients treated with FL, 16.3% were
older than 70 years, compared with 15.8% of those
treated with FLOX. The majority of patients on both
treatment arms were white (85.1%).
Bowel wall injury was reported in 51 (5.5%)
patients treated with the FLOX regimen and in 28
(3.0%) patients who received FL without oxaliplatin
(P < .01; Table 2). In both arms the small bowel was
involved more frequently with BWI than was the colon. Involvement of the ileum was more common

than involvement of other sites within the small
bowel. BWI involving both small bowel and colon
occurred in 12 (2.4%) patients treated with FLOX versus only 1 (0.1%) who received FL. ES was also more
common in patients treated with FLOX, 2.4% versus
0.9% (P 5 .01; Table 2). Few patients had both BWI
and ES, 3 patients on FL and 9 on FLOX.
The incidence of both BWI and ES are shown by
patient characteristics in Table 1. The incidence of
BWI was similar in patients younger than 60 years of
age treated with either FL (3.1%) or FLOX (4.5%, P 5
.28). Those 60 years of age, however, were at higher
risk for BWI after treatment with FLOX (6.7%) than
with FL (2.9%, P < .01).
Women had a higher incidence of BWI in the
FLOX treatment arm (9.1%) than in the FL arm
(3.9%, P < .01). Treatment with FLOX did not
increase toxicity in men (2.4% in each arm). ES was
also more common in women (2.8%) than in men
(0.7%, P < .001). Similar gender differences were
apparent for other GI toxicities such as nausea,

vomiting, and dehydration, all of which were seen
more frequently in women than in men treated with
either FLOX or FL (data not shown). The distribution
of toxicity by race could not be adequately studied
because of small numbers of minorities recruited
into the trial.
BWI and ES usually occurred during the first
cycle of therapy, peaking in the third week for those
receiving FLOX and in the fourth week for those
receiving FL treatment (Fig. 2). Only 11.4% of all BWI
events occurred after the first cycle of therapy. Duration of BWI was similar between the FL and FLOX
groups (median 13 days from diagnosis to discharge
from hospital). Clostridium difficile infection in
patients with BWI or ES was rare, reported in only 1
of 33 patients receiving FL and in 4 of 64 patients
treated with FLOX. Surgical intervention was required
in 9 patients with BWI (11.4%), 5 FL-treated, and 4
FLOX-treated. Two patients who developed ES with
FLOX (9.0%) were taken to surgery; both of these
patients also had BWI. None of those who encoun-

tered ES after treatment with FL required subsequent
surgery.
Seventy-one percent of those with BWI were
retreated with FL after recovery from toxicity as
allowed per protocol. One of these patients developed BWI after retreatment. After the development
of ES, 15 of 30 patients resumed treatment with FL
and 1 patient had further evidence of severe diarrhea
and sepsis.
Five patients (0.3%) in this cohort of 1857
patients randomized after November 1 2000 died
with severe bowel toxicity. Death in 2 FLOX-treated
patients was attributable to ES. Two other FLOX-treated patients and 1 FL-treated patient died from complications related to both BWI and ES.

DISCUSSION
Injury of the bowel wall by a variety of chemotherapeutic agents has been previously reported.5–12 Neutropenic enterocolitis has been associated with highdose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant and
with standard-dose chemotherapy in patients with
solid tumors. BWI in the absence of neutropenia has
also been reported in patients treated with FL.9
Grade 4 neutropenia was not a component of the
BWI syndrome in the present report.
Diarrhea and dehydration with or without neutropenia is a common toxicity reported in patients
treated with 5-FU combination chemotherapy regimens.1,2 This can lead to causing further morbidity
and delay of therapy. Patients with GI toxicity from
therapy, especially in the adjuvant setting, may not
complete the prescribed treatment, thereby potentially compromising treatment efficacy. In addition,
the estimated cost of treatment for this toxicity is
substantial.13
The schedule of FL given weekly for 6 weeks
developed at Roswell Park Memorial Institute14 as
given in the FL regimen on NSABP C-07 was associated with diarrhea in 40% of previously untreated
patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma,
half of whom required hospitalization for intravenous hydration.14 However, the present report is
the first large, prospective evaluation of BWI and
ES in patients treated with this regimen with or
without the addition of oxaliplatin in the adjuvant
setting.
Bowel wall thickening on CT scan has been
described in association with ischemia because of a
wide variety of causes,15 including cancer chemotherapy. This radiographic finding is therefore nonspecific, reflecting edema of the bowel wall. In our
study, bowel wall thickening was associated with

severe diarrhea and dehydration and required surgical intervention in 11.4% of patients who developed
this abnormality.
BWI and ES in our study occurred in patients
treated with either FL or FLOX but were more common and were seen somewhat earlier in those treated
with FLOX, suggesting that oxaliplatin independently
contributed to GI toxicity. Regardless of which treatment patients received, BWI more frequently involved
the small bowel rather than the large bowel. Preferential involvement of small bowel with 5-FU-induced
GI toxicity has been noted by others.12 In the vast
majority of patients in this report, the sites of BWI
involvement were detected by CT scan. Barium radiographs of the colon or small bowel were used in
some cases, and a few cases were confirmed by
endoscopy or surgery.
Older patients were more susceptible to the GI
toxicity associated with FLOX. It is unclear if this was
due to associated medical conditions, delay in treatment of symptoms, differences in drug metabolism,
or greater intrinsic susceptibility to bowel wall toxicity from oxaliplatin given in combination with 5-FU
in this cohort of patients. The enhanced susceptibility to GI toxicity among older patients cannot be
explained by poorer pretreatment performance status, however, because there was no significant association between performance status and age. Women
also had a higher incidence of BWI and ES than did
men, especially with FLOX. Enhanced susceptibility
of women to various toxicities from fluorinated pyrimidines has been previously reported,16,17 and therefore the differences in toxicity according to gender
observed in this study are not new. The reason for
these gender differences is unclear, but is not related
to cumulative toxicity resulting from multiple doses
of chemotherapy because the vast majority of cases
of enteropathy among both men and women
occurred after only a few doses of chemotherapy in
the first cycle of therapy.
In this study the management of established
BWI or ES required hospitalization, which was often
prolonged before diarrhea resolved. Recovery was
only rarely delayed by C. difficile superinfection. Despite the severity of symptoms, two-thirds of patients
subsequently received further adjuvant therapy, as
allowed per protocol. These patients were to be treated with a reduced dose of 5-FU in combination with
leucovorin, which may explain the low incidence (1
case) of reported episodes of recurrent bowel injury.
The outcome in 8 patients with BWI or ES retreated
with an oxaliplatin-containing regimen after initially
receiving FLOX is unknown, except for 1 patient who
had recurrent ES after only 1 additional dose of

Enteropathy in Colon CA/Kuebler et al.

FLOX, and a second patient who experienced recurrent BWI.
The therapeutic results of C-0718 confirm the
earlier conclusions from the MOSAIC trial19 that a
combination of 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin
improves disease-free survival after resection for
stage II and III colon cancer. Analysis of disease-free
survival in each of these clinical trials demonstrated
a relative risk reduction of approximately 20% when
oxaliplatin was added to 5-FU and leucovorin. GI
toxicity associated with the bolus and continuous
infusion 5-FU-containing FOLFOX4 regimen used in
the MOSAIC trial appears to be much less than in
the ‘‘Roswell Park Regimen’’ of weekly bolus 5-FU
and 2-hour leucovorin infusion FLOX regimen. The
incidence of grade 3 and 4 diarrhea was reported to
be 10.8% for FOLFOX4 and 38.0% for FLOX. Neither
the BWI nor the ES syndrome was reported after
treatment with FOLFOX4. There was more grade 3/4
neutropenia associated with FOLFOX4 than with
FLOX, 41.1% versus <5%, but neutropenic fever or
infection documented by culture was reported in
only 1.8% of patients treated with FOLFOX4. The
higher incidence of neurotoxicity noted in the
MOSAIC trial for FOLFOX4-treated patients (12.4%)
over that reported in C-07 for FLOX-treated patients
(8.2%) is likely related to the 25% decreased cumulative dose of oxaliplatin used in the latter trial. Overall
treatment-related mortality was reported in 0.5% of
patients treated with FOLFOX4 versus 1.2% of
patients treated with FLOX.
The higher incidence of GI toxicity from FLOX
should be considered when choosing an adjuvant
therapy for patients with resected colon cancer. The
incidence of BWI or ES from FLOX is 6.9%. Although
toxicity can be severe and sometimes prolonged,
upon recovery many patients can continue therapy
safely with a reduced dose of the FL regimen. Frequent monitoring for the onset of diarrhea is
recommended for patients on FLOX because mild
diarrhea can progress rapidly to more severe episodes of toxicity.1 Patients should be warned about
severe diarrhea and instructed to initiate oral therapy with an antidiarrheal agent at the first sign of
toxicity. A low threshold should be maintained to
withhold chemotherapy and begin intravenous
hydration in patients who suffer more than 4 diarrheal episodes per day. Hospitalization and aggressive management for possible infection and fluid
and electrolyte disorders is mandated in patients
who have evidence of BWI or ES. Clostridium difficile should be ruled out in such cases and patients
should receive antibiotics. Consideration should be
given for the use of a long-acting formulation of

1949

octreotide, which has documented efficacy in the
treatment of diarrhea.20 With the resolution of
symptoms, patients may be retreated, but we do not
recommend the use of additional oxaliplatin.
The FLOX and FOLFOX regimens appear to be
similarly effective as postoperative adjuvant therapy for stage II and III colon cancer.18,19 The lower
incidence of neurotoxicity along with the simplicity
of bolus delivery versus an implanted catheter or
port and infusion pump may make adjuvant therapy with FLOX a better choice in selected patients,
provided care is taken to minimize and to aggressively manage the enteropathy described in this
report.
