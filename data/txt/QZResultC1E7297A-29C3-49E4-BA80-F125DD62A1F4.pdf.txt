Abstract
Purpose: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with
increased lung cancer risk. We evaluated the association of statin use with lung
cancer risk in COPD patients and identified which statins possess the highest
chemopreventive potential.
Results: After adjustment for age, sex, CCI, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
urbanization level, and monthly income according to propensity scores, lung cancer
risk in the statin users was lower than that in the statin nonusers (adjusted hazard
ratio [aHR] = 0.37). Of the individual statins, lovastatin and fluvastatin did not
reduce lung cancer risk significantly. By contrast, lung cancer risk in patients using
rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and pravastatin was significantly lower than
that in statin nonusers (aHRs = 0.41, 0.44, 0.52, and 0.58, respectively). Statins
dose-dependently reduced lung cancer risk in all subgroups and the main model with
additional covariates (nonstatin drug use).
Materials and Methods: The study cohort comprised all patients diagnosed with
COPD at health care facilities in Taiwan (n = 116,017) between January 1, 2001 and
December 31, 2012. Our final study cohort comprised 43,802 COPD patients: 10,086
used statins, whereas 33,716 did not. Patients were followed up to assess lung cancer
risk or protective factors. In addition, we also considered demographic characteristics,
namely age, sex, comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and Charlson
comorbidity index [CCI]), urbanization level, monthly income, and nonstatin drug
use. The index date of statin use was the COPD confirmation date. To examine the
dose–response relationship, we categorized statin use into four groups in each cohort:
< 28, 28–90, 91–365, and > 365 cumulative defined daily doses (cDDDs). Patients
receiving < 28 cDDDs were defined as nonstatin users.
Conclusions: Statins dose-dependently exert a significant chemopreventive effect
against lung cancer in COPD patients. Rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin
exhibited the highest chemopreventive potential.

INTRODUCTION

obesity-related cancers may remain prevalent in the
coming decades, we initiated this study targeting statinbased chemoprevention. Thus far, studies supporting
the chemopreventive mechanism of statins against lung
cancer in patients with COPD have been scant; in addition,
variation in the chemoprevention profiles of individual
statins is unclear. This is the first study to establish an
association between statin use and the chemoprevention
of lung cancer in patients with COPD, and is also the
first study to investigate which statins exert the highest
chemopreventive effects.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
is the seventh leading cause of death in Taiwan [1].
COPD is increasingly considered a multisystem
disease characterized by both pulmonary and systemic
inflammation. Comorbidities of COPD generally include
diseases involving the pulmonary system (infective
exacerbations, pneumonia, influenza, and lung cancer)
and cardiovascular system (acute coronary syndrome,
endothelial dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension).
COPD is independently associated with increased
lung cancer risk, which is probably associated with the
inflammation and scarring that occurs during COPD
development [2–4]. Moreover, lung cancer is the leading
cause of cancer death in Taiwan [1].
Our previous observational studies have suggested
that statin use may reduce the overall risk of cancers
and of specific cancers [5], possibly by inhibiting
downstream products of the mevalonate pathway [6–9],
triggering tumor-specific apoptosis [10], and inhibiting
the proteasome pathway [11]. In theory, statins can
reduce COPD-induced inflammation and scarring and
further decrease lung cancer risk in patients with COPD.
In addition, statins can reduce the risk of esophageal
cancer [12], colorectal cancer [13], gastric cancer [14],
hepatocellular carcinoma [15], and prostate cancer [16].
However, a meta-analysis indicated that statin use has no
effect on lung cancer risk [17]. COPD and lung cancer are
associated through several factors in addition to smoking
or aeropollutant exposure [18–21]. Because patients with
COPD have a high lung cancer risk, the effect of statins
may differ from that observed previously [17].
Statins are the most powerful drugs available for
reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)
levels; they are the most effective lipid-lowering drugs for
improving clinical outcomes when used for the primary
and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
Statin selection depends upon several factors, including the
degree of hyperlipidemia, pharmacokinetic properties of
the drug, drug interactions, presence of renal impairment,
and cost. Currently available statins include lovastatin,
pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and
rosuvastatin. These agents are competitive inhibitors
of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
reductase, which is involved in the rate-limiting step
of cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins occupy a portion
of the HMG-CoA active site, blocking the binding of
the substrate to the enzyme [22]. Most statins reduce
LDL-C and triglycerides levels and moderately increase
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels;
nevertheless, different statins have different efficacies.
Whether these differences may be associated with a
decrease in lung cancer risk remains unclear.
Thus, considering that systemic inflammation
is implicated in lung cancer and that smoking- and

RESULTS
Our COPD cohort comprised 43,802 patients,
10,086 (30%) of whom used statins and the remaining
33,716 (70%) of whom did not (Table 1). The total followup duration was 194,933.6 and 80,239.4 person-years for
the statin nonusers and users, respectively. Compared
with the statin nonusers, the statin users exhibited a
higher prevalence of pre-existing medical comorbidities
including diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, along
with a higher CCI (all P < 0.001). In addition, significant
differences were observed between the two groups in the
distributions of age, monthly income, and urbanization
level as well as use of nonstatin lipid-lowering drug,
aspirin, ACEI, and metformin (Table 1). A higher
proportion of statin nonusers used nonstatin lipid-lowering
drugs, metformin, ACEI, and aspirin for < 28 days;
however, most of the statin users used these drugs for
> 365 days. A lower proportion of statin nonusers had a
monthly income of NT$33,301 or more or resided in urban
areas. Table 2 shows the lung cancer risk of the statin
nonusers and users. After PS adjustment for age, sex, CCI,
diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, urbanization level,
and monthly income, we analyzed the risk of lung cancer.
The adjusted HRs (aHRs) of lung cancer were lower in
the statin users than in the statin nonusers (aHR = 0.37,
95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31 to 0.44). The stratified
analysis showed that the aHRs were significantly lower
in the statin users, particularly those aged 65–74 years,
regardless of sex. Specifically, the aHRs of lung cancer
were lower in the statin users than in the statin nonusers
for every age group (40–64, 65–74, and ≥ 75 years; aHRs
= 0.37, 0.31, and 0.43, respectively). The statin users
also exhibited lower lung cancer aHRs than did the statin
nonusers after sex stratification (women: aHR = 0.34, 95%
CI: 0.25 to 0.45; men: aHR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.32 to 0.48).
Statins dose-dependently reduced the risk of
lung cancer in different cDDD subgroups; the main
model was PS adjusted for age, sex, CCI, diabetes,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, urbanization level, and
monthly income (Table 3). Lipophilia statins comprised
simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, and fluvastatin,
whereas hydrophilia statins comprised pravastatin
and rosuvastatin. Table 3 presents the lung cancer risk

reduction demonstrated by lipophilia and hydrophilia
statins in patients with COPD along with the doses and
responses (P for trend < 0.001). Among individual statins,
lovastatin and fluvastatin did not reduce the risk of lung
cancer in patients with COPD significantly. The aHRs of
lung cancer for patients using rosuvastatin, simvastatin,
atorvastatin, and pravastatin were lower compared with
that of statin nonusers (aHRs = 0.41, 0.44, 0.52 and 0.58,
respectively). Our results revealed that individual statins
reduced lung cancer risk at varying efficacies among
COPD patients.
In the sensitivity analysis, PS adjustments were
made to estimate the associations of age, sex, CCI,
diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, urbanization level,
monthly income, and nonstatin lipid-lowering drugs,
metformin, ACEI, and aspirin use with the incidence of
lung cancer in different models. Table 4 shows that the
effects of statins remained significant in the subgroups of
various covariates when the main model was adjusted for
PSs. Statins dose-dependently reduced the risk of lung
cancer in all subgroups and the main model with additional
covariates (nonstatin lipid-lowering drugs, metformin,
ACEI, or aspirin use). All aHRs indicated that statins
dose-dependently induced significant reductions in lung
cancer risk in all subgroups, regardless of comorbidities or
drug use (P < 0.001). Thus, our data revealed that statins
show a dose-dependent chemopreventive effect against
lung cancer.

study reported the effects of statins on mortality in
patients with COPD by using the Rotterdam study data;
stratification by high-sensitivity CRP revealed that allcause mortality was 78% lower among patients with CRP
≥ 3 mg/L, whereas it was only by 21% lower among those
with CRP < 3 mg/L [43]. The authors concluded that
statins therapy primarily benefited the all-cause mortality
of patients whose CRP levels indicated underlying
systemic inflammation [43].
Statins attenuate both pulmonary and systemic
inflammation through their effects on the NF-κB/STAT3
proinflammatory pathways [23]. Statins are considered
effective anti-inflammatory agents that reduce the levels
of systemic markers (IL-6 and CRP) by more than 50%
in a few days [44]. Statins exhibit immune-modulating
(i.e., anti-inflammatory) effects that may be particularly
crucial in COPD, in which both pulmonary and systemic
inflammation are believed to be central causes of
symptoms (exertional breathlessness, cough, and fatigue),
hospitalization, and premature death (from pulmonary
infection or exacerbation, lung cancer, and cardiac
disease). Therefore, a great need exists for novel COPD
treatments that minimize neutrophil-driven pulmonary
and systemic inflammation that alters the natural
history of the disease by slowing lung function decline,
minimizing cardiovascular and respiratory infectionrelated morbidities, and reducing cancer risk [23]. A
meta-analysis showed no effect statin use on the risk of
lung cancer [17]; nevertheless, in the present study, COPD
patients with a high risk of lung cancer who used statins
exhibited a 63% reduced lung cancer risk (Table 2). This
is the first study to report that statin-based agents could be
of chemopreventive value against lung cancer, specifically
for patients with COPD.
Rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin cause
the greatest percentage change in LDL-C; thus, they are
preferred for use in patients who require a potent statin
because of high cardiovascular risk or who require a > 35%
reduction in LDL-C level. Rosuvastatin is relatively more
potent than atorvastatin [45, 46] and both are significantly
more potent than simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, or
fluvastatin [46, 47]. At their maximal prescribed doses,
rosuvastatin and atorvastatin cause LDL-C level reductions
greater than those caused by other available statins. Statin
therapy typically increases HDL-C levels; however, these
effects vary depending on the statin type and are not
correlated with the effects on LDL-C levels. For example,
simvastatin and rosuvastatin increase HDL-C levels as their
doses are increased, whereas at higher doses, atorvastatin
attenuates increases in HDL-C levels [48]. Atorvastatin and
rosuvastatin are more effective for reducing triglyceride
levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia than other
statins are [46, 49–51]. Our results revealed that different
statins were associated with varying reductions in lung
cancer risk among the COPD patients (Table 3). Notably,
the stronger efficacies of rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and

DISCUSSION
Recently, interest in the function of systemic
inflammation in COPD has been increasing [23–27].
Epidemiological studies have shown that elevated
levels of systemic inflammatory markers, particularly
C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and
fibrinogen, predict poor outcomes in COPD, including
accelerated loss of lung function, greater propensity for
infective exacerbations, and greater mortality [28–30].
This systemic inflammation has three likely mechanisms.
The first is a “spillover” effect from inflammation (driven
primarily in the lungs in response to aeropollutants, mainly
cigarette smoke) to neutrophilic inflammation and finally
to recurrent infection [31, 32]. The second is the existence
of an inherent systemic-based proinflammatory state
conferred by a genetic disposition [23, 33, 34]. Smoking,
as a recurring proinflammatory stimulus to the pulmonary
and immune systems, considerably enhances this
inflammatory disposition. The final possible mechanism
is elevated systemic inflammation, which has been linked
to progressive loss of lung function [24–27, 35–37] and to
many types of cancer [37–39].
CRP is mainly a marker of inflammation. When
some organs are chronically inflamed, they are at greater
cancer risk [40, 41]. Increased CRP levels are associated
with increased cancer risk [42]. A large-scale prospective

simvastatin in reducing LDL-C and triglyceride levels
and increasing high HDL-C levels were proportional to
the decreased aHRs of lung cancer risk (Table 3). No clear
data regarding the use of different individual statins has
been previously reported [17]. In our study, lovastatin and
fluvastatin exhibited no significant reduction in lung cancer
risk in patients with COPD. We are the first to report that
rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin show stronger
chemopreventive effect against lung cancer risk in patients
with COPD. Of these, rosuvastatin exhibited the highest
chemopreventive potential, followed by simvastatin and
atorvastatin.
Statin use dose-dependently reduced lung cancer
risk in the COPD patients and in the main model with
additional covariates (Table 4). The use of aspirin,
nonstatins lipid-lowering drugs, metformin, and ACEI also
has an anticancer effect [5]. When the cDDDs of aspirin,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metformin, and ACEI were > 365, the chemopreventive
effect of statins against lung cancer was masked (Table 4).
However, our sensitivity analysis indicated that when
the cDDDs of statins increased to > 365, the aHRs
of lung cancer risk in the COPD patients decreased
significantly. However, the aHRs of lung cancer risk
were nonsignificant when the cDDDs of nonstatin lipidlowering drugs were > 365 (Table 4). These outcomes
might explain the independent chemopreventive effects of
aspirin, metformin, ACEI, and statins. However, unknown
associations between nonstatin lipid-lowering drugs and
statins were observed in the reduction of lung cancer risk
in the COPD patients. This study is also the first report that
statins exert dose–response and chemopreventive effects
against lung cancer in patients with COPD.
However, this study has potential limitations.

COPD and lung cancer, including indoor and outdoor air
pollution, domestic use of biomass fuels, occupational
exposure to dust and fumes, and smoking could not be
eliminated [52, 53]. A future large-scale randomized
trial with a suitable regimen in well-selected patients
must compare standard approaches to obtain this crucial
information. However, methodological issues may obscure
the precise relationship between these factors and lung
cancer risk. According to one theory, higher urbanization
levels and income are associated with lower lung cancer
risk. In our study, we used PSs to match age, sex, CCI,
diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, urbanization level,
and monthly income. Urbanization level and monthly
income are nonvalidated alternatives to lifestyle factors
and environmental levels. To obtain more appropriate

information, a large-scale randomized trial should apply
a suitable regimen to appropriately selected patients for
comparing standard approaches. Moreover, in this study,
the diagnoses of lung cancer and all other comorbidities
were completely dependent on ICD codes. However, the
NHI Administration randomly reviews medical records
and interviews patients to validate diagnoses. Hospitals
with outlier diagnoses and practices may be audited
and penalized heavily if malpractice or discrepancies
are discovered. Another limitation is that information
regarding several unmeasured confounders, including
body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, and use
of other over-the-counter drugs (some of which are
associated with lung cancer), is unavailable in the NHIRD.

the observed effects, it is unlikely that these limitations
compromised the results. Finally, this was not a
prospective randomized blinded study; hence, a cause–
effect relationship could not be established. The findings
of this study suggest that statins dose-dependently exert
a significant chemopreventive effect against lung cancer
in COPD patients. Additional randomized studies are
required to verify these findings.

of COPD confirmation. Because we aimed to evaluate the
preventive effects of statin use in COPD patients who have
a high lung cancer risk, the primary endpoint was lung
cancer risk and the secondary endpoints were different
benefits if different doses or types of statins used. The
defined daily dose (DDD)—recommended by the World
Health Organization—is a measure of the prescribed
drug amount. DDD is the assumed average maintenance
dose per day of a drug consumed for its main indication
in adults.12 To examine the dose–response relationship,
we categorized statin use into four groups in each cohort
(< 28, 28–90, 91–365, and > 365 cumulative DDDs
[cDDDs]) because the duration of the refill card was 3
months. Patients receiving < 28 cDDDs were defined as
nonstatin users (Tables 2–4) [54]. Furthermore, to examine
the preventive effect of different types of statins, we
categorized statin use into different individual statin use
groups in each cohort (Table 3).
Propensity scores (PSs) were derived using a
logistic regression model to estimate the effect of statins
by accounting for the covariates predicting receiving the
intervention (statins). This method is commonly used
in observational studies to reduce selection bias [55].
The covariates in the main model were PS adjusted for
age, sex, CCI, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
urbanization level, and monthly income in New Taiwan
dollars (NT$0, NT$1–21,000, NT$21,000–33,300; and
≥ NT$33,301) (Table 2). The endpoint for both statin users
and nonusers was the diagnosis of lung cancer (ICD-9CM 162) with a subsequent outpatient visit, emergency
department visit, or inpatient hospitalization for lung
cancer within 12 months of diagnosis; the nonusers were
used as the reference arm. The cumulative incidence of
lung cancer in the two groups was estimated using the
Kaplan–Meier method.
A time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model
was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) of lung
cancer in the statin users and nonusers. The HRs were
adjusted for age, sex, CCI, diabetes, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, urbanization level, and monthly income
in the multivariate analysis. A stratified analysis was
conducted to evaluate the effect of statin use on age
and sex (Table 2). All analyses were conducted using
SAS software (Version 9.3; SAS, Cary, NC, USA); twotailed P < 0.05 was considered significant. In sensitivity
analyses, external adjustments are used to improve the
understanding of the effects of drugs and other covariates
in epidemiological database studies [56]. Hence, in our
sensitivity analyses, data were adjusted in different models
to estimate the association of lung cancer incidence with
age, sex, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, CCI,
anxiety disorder, and the use of nonstatin lipid-lowering
drugs, metformin, aspirin, and ACEI. The drug usestratified models were adjusted for covariates in the main
model and for each additional covariate (Table 4).

Materials AND METHODS
The National Health Insurance (NHI) program,
which was established in 1995, currently provides
comprehensive health insurance coverage to 98% of the
more than 23 million people in Taiwan. In this study, we
used data from the National Health Insurance Research
Database (NHIRD). No statistically significant differences
were observed in age, sex, or health care costs between
the NHIRD sample group and all NHI enrollees. Data
that could be used to identify patients or care providers,
including medical institutions and physicians, are
encrypted before being sent to the National Health
Research Institutes for construction of the NHIRD. The
Institutes further encrypts the data before being releasing
the database to researchers. Theoretically, the NHIRD
data alone is insufficient to identify any individual. All
researchers using the NHIRD and its data subsets must sign
a written agreement declaring that they have no intention
of attempting to obtain information that could potentially
violate the privacy of patients or care providers [5].
Our study cohort comprised all patients diagnosed
with COPD (according to International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9CM] codes) at health care facilities in Taiwan (n = 116,017)
between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2012. We
excluded patients without a subsequent outpatient visit,
emergency department visit, or inpatient hospitalization
for COPD within 12 months of the first presentation
(n = 48,212); these patients were considered to not have
COPD (Figure 1). We also excluded 15,436 patients who
were younger than 40 years old (n = 52,369) and had any
inpatient or outpatient diagnosis related to cancer before
the enrollment date (n = 5,353) or had any statin prescribed
within 6 months before the index date (n = 3,214).
Our final study cohort contained 43,802 patients
diagnosed with COPD in Taiwan over the 11-year period,
10,086 of whom used statins and 33,716 of whom did
not. Each patient was followed to assess lung cancer
risk or protective factors. In addition, we considered the
demographic characteristics of age and sex; comorbidities
of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and Charlson
comorbidity index (CCI); urbanization level; monthly
income; and use of nonstatin lipid-lowering drugs,
metformin, aspirin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor (ACEI). The index date of statin use was the date
