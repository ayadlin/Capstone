Dasatinib is a highly potent Bcr-Abl inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Across a series of phase 2 and 3 trials, dasatinib was associated with durable treatment responses
in all phases of the disease and was well tolerated. For this article, the authors reviewed available information on specific side effects associated with the use of dasatinib. On the basis of more than 2 years’ experience of dasatinib treatment during clinical trials, they provide practical recommendations for side-effect

KEY WORDS: dasatinib, chronic myeloid leukemia, side effects, imatinib.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a primary hematopoietic stem cell disorder associated with a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 that results in the formation of the Philadelphia
chromosome (Ph) and constitutively active tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL.1,2 Ph is detected in 95% of patients
with CML and in 20% to 30% of adults with Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A significant number of patients with CML and no detectable Ph demonstrate the BCR-ABL molecular rearrangement. Most patients with CML (80%) are diagnosed during the initial chronic phase (CP).3 Without
effective treatment, CML inevitably progresses to the accelerated phase (AP) and/or to the refractory blast
phase (BP), which has a predicted survival of a few months. The main objectives of treatment are to prevent
progression to advanced phases of disease and, in advanced phases, to reduce the number of leukemic cells.
Imatinib mesylate (Glivec [Gleevec in the US]; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), a targeted inhibitor of
Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity, is the current first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed
CML.4 Imatinib is associated with high response rates in CML-CP, and most responses are durable. However, many patients require alternative treatment options after imatinib failure. In the pivotal phase 3

International Randomized Study of Interferon Versus
STI-571 (IRIS) trial in patients with newly diagnosed
CML-CP, 31% of patients did not achieve a complete
cytogenetic response (CCyR) during 12 months of treatment, and 13% still had not achieved a CCyR by 5 years.
In addition, from 3% to 7% of patients in that trial experienced treatment failure during the first 3 years, and that
failure rate fell to <2% in subsequent years.5 Five percent
of patients in the IRIS trial discontinued imatinib because
of side effects. Patients with advanced CML (AP or BP)
experience lower treatment response rates because of
higher rates of imatinib resistance, failure, and toxicity.6,7
Responses to imatinib in patients with Ph-positive ALL
are transient.2
Dasatinib (SPRYCEL; Bristol-Myers Squibb, New
York, NY) is an oral Bcr-Abl inhibitor approved for imatinib-resistant CML and Ph-positive ALL (approved in the
US and Europe since 2006). Dasatinib has a chemical
structure that is unrelated to imatinib, although both
agents have overlapping binding sites within the Abl
1382

kinase domain.8 It is predicted that dasatinib, unlike
imatinib, will bind to both the active and inactive conformations of Abl.8 In vitro, dasatinib has 325-fold greater
potency than imatinib for unmutated Bcr-Abl and inhibitory activity against mutants with high levels of imatinib
resistance, except for T315I.9 Dasatinib also inhibits other
tyrosine kinases, including Src family kinases, c-Kit, EPH
receptor A2, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR)-b.10
Dasatinib has been evaluated clinically in phase 1, 2,
and 3 trials in adults with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant,
Ph-positive leukemias (Table 1). In phase 1, encouraging
treatment responses were observed with dasatinib administered both once daily and twice daily. No maximum tolerated dose was identified, and most patients who entered
the study after imatinib nonhematologic intolerance did
not have similar adverse events (AEs) with dasatinib, suggesting a lack of cross intolerance.11 In a series of international phase 2 trials known as the SRC/ABL Tyrosine

(START), dasatinib 70 mg twice daily demonstrated high
levels of hematologic and cytogenetic responses in patients
with all phases of CML or Ph-positive ALL (Table 2).12-20
In addition, in a randomized phase 2 trial in patients with
CML-CP resistant to imatinib (START-R), dasatinib was
associated with significantly higher rates of CCyR (40%
vs 16%; P ¼ .004) and major molecular response (16% vs
4%; P ¼ .038) and with a significantly extended duration
of progression-free survival (P < .001) compared with
imatinib at an increased dose of 800 mg daily.16
Longer follow-up of patients who received dasatinib
during phase 1 revealed that those who received oncedaily treatment experienced fewer AEs than those who
received twice-daily treatment. In addition, because of
dose reductions for AEs, the median actual daily dose for
patients with CML-CP during the START-C and
START-R trials was close to 100 mg (101 mg and 103
mg, respectively).16,17 This led to 2 large, phase 3, doseoptimization studies in imatinib-resistant or -intolerant
patients: CA180-034 and CA180-035. In the CA180034 trial, patients with CML-CP were randomized to
receive either once daily or twice daily treatment at total
daily doses of 100 mg or 140 mg.21,22 In that trial, dasatinib had similar efficacy across all treatment groups,
although patients who received 100 mg once daily experiCancer

enced fewer AEs and required fewer dose interruptions.
Subsequently, the approved dose for dasatinib in patients
with CML-CP was updated in various countries, including the US and Europe, to 100 mg once daily.23,24 In the
second phase 3 trial (CA180-035) patients with CML-AP
or CML-BP or with Ph-positive ALL were randomized to
receive dasatinib either 140 mg once daily or 70 mg twice
daily25 In those patients, both schedules were associated
with similar efficacy; however, with once-daily treatment,
significantly fewer AEs and treatment interruptions were
observed. Because response durability has not been confirmed, the recommended dasatinib dose for patients with
advanced CML or Ph-positive ALL remains 70 mg twice
daily. Longer follow-up is needed for both the CA180034 and CA180-035 studies to confirm the initial
findings.
Although the efficacy of dasatinib is well established,
the management of AEs has been discussed less widely,
particularly those AEs that are observed more frequently
with dasatinib than with imatinib. The objectives of this
review were to report the incidence of the most common
or clinically significant AEs during dasatinib treatment, to
discuss possible underlying mechanisms, and to provide
practical suggestions for management. The information
on AEs described in this review was derived from extensive
1383

Review Article

data collected from approximately 2200 patients enrolled
on dasatinib trials. Although, to our knowledge, there are
no clinical data that compare the relative effectiveness of
potential interventions, management suggestions have
been based on guidelines used in clinical trials and the
experience of institutions and investigators.

Safety Profile of Dasatinib
Dasatinib generally is well tolerated and is associated with
manageable and reversible, treatment-related AEs. Recent
follow-up from dasatinib trials indicates that most AEs
occur early after the initiation of dasatinib therapy.26-29 In
addition, no significant cross intolerance between dasatinib and imatinib has been observed.30 The most common
dasatinib-associated AEs include cytopenias (neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia), fluid retention (pleural effusion),
dyspnea, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, skin rash,
headache, and fatigue (Table 3). The AE rates reported
below are from dasatinib trials that had a follow-up of
approximately 12 months. Because of the significant
impact of disease stage and dasatinib dosing schedule,
safety data for patients with CML-CP (most patients) and
patients with advanced CML are considered separately.
For patients with CML-CP, AEs are reported for both the
currently approved 100 mg once-daily regimen and the
previous 70 mg twice-daily regimen.

Cytopenias
Cytopenias occur most often within the first 1 to 2
months of dasatinib treatment31 and are more common
in patients with advanced CML or Ph-positive ALL than
in patients with CML-CP (Table 3). The incidence may
be higher among patients who discontinued imatinib
because of cytopenias.30 In the START-R study, grade 3/
4 cytopenias were more common with dasatinib 70 mg
twice daily than with high-dose imatinib (800 mg daily).
In a single-institution study, the initial episode of grade 2,
3, or 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia occurred during
the first 3 months of therapy in approximately 80% of
cases and was recurrent in 92% of cases.31 Therefore, routine, frequent complete blood counts are essential to monitor cytopenias during dasatinib treatment, particularly
during initial treatment. Treatment-related cytopenia
during dasatinib clinical trials was managed by temporary
1384

dose interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of
therapy (Table 4). In the START-C study (70 mg twice
daily), the median length of the first treatment interruption for hematologic toxicity was 18 days, and hematologic toxicity led to discontinuation in 13% of patients.17
In the CA180-034 study in patients with CML-CP, fewer
patients who received 100 mg once daily required treatment interruptions (27% vs 35%) or reductions (22% vs
32%) for hematologic toxicity compared with patients
who received 70 mg twice daily22 In patients with
advanced disease or with Ph-positive ALL, a bone marrow
biopsy can help differentiate between dasatinib-induced
cytopenia (ie, hypoplastic or aplastic bone marrow) and
cytopenia caused by leukemic proliferation (usually manifested by persistent blasts).

Neutropenia
In patients with CML-CP, a lower incidence of grade 3/4
neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1  109/L) was
observed with 100 mg once daily compared with 70 mg
twice daily (34% vs 43%) (Table 3).21 In a single-institution study, the median time to grade 2, 3, or 4 neutropenia in patients with CML-CP (n ¼ 29) was 59 days
(range, 2-149 days).31 In phase 2 trials among patients
with advanced CML or Ph-positive ALL, grade 3/4 neutropenia was reported in 76% to 81% of patients.18-20
Unlike patients with advanced CML, patients with CMLCP are unlikely to experience leukemia-induced cytopenias; in these patients, dasatinib-induced grade 3/4 neutropenia is managed best by holding the drug until the
neutrophil count increases to 1.0  109/L. Then, dasatinib can be reintroduced successfully at the original dose or
at a reduced dose if neutrophil recovery takes longer than
7 days (Table 4).23,24 Treatment interruptions usually are
not recommended with grade 1/2 neutropenia. Preliminary data suggest that granulocyte-colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF; filgrastim) may be useful for managing
neutropenia during dasatinib treatment.31 Among 7
patients who received G-CSF therapy (initial dose, 300
lg 2-7 days per week), all patients increased their neutrophil count from <1.0  109/L to >2.0  109/L in a median of 10 days, and G-CSF enabled more continuous
treatment (median time off treatment, 40% before GCSF, 24% with G-CSF). The combination was tolerated
well, although long-term safety has not been established.

AE indicates adverse event; ANC, absolute neutrophil count; CML, chronic myeloid leukemia; Phþ, Philadelphia chromosome-positive; ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; BID, twice daily; QD, once daily; QTcF, QTc interval change from baseline using the Fridericia method; CNS, central nervous system.
* These recommendations are based on those suggested in dasatinib clinical trial protocols. Recommended dasatinib starting doses in the United States and
Europe are 100 mg QD for patients with CML in chronic phase and 70 mg BID for patients with advanced CML. Dose adjustment levels from a 100 mg QD
starting dose are: reduction (1), 80 mg QD; escalation (þ1), 140 mg QD. Dose adjustment levels from a 70 mg BID starting dose are: reduction (1), 50 mg
BID; reduction (2), 40 mg BID; escalation (þ1), 90 mg BID. Responses also have been observed during phase 1 with lower dasatinib doses (see Talpaz
200611); potential benefits of lower doses should be considered compared with alternative options.

Review Article

Despite the high incidence of neutropenia, treatment-related febrile neutropenia of any grade is uncommon (5% of all dasatinib-treated patients),24 perhaps
because of the common use of prophylactic antibiotics in
patients with advanced disease. Intravenous antimicrobial
therapy, temporary dasatinib interruption, and the
administration of myeloid growth factors until neutrophil
recovery (1.0  109/L) and resolution of infection commonly are used (Table 4).
Anemia
Grade 3/4 anemia (hemoglobin level <80 g/L) is reported
in 10% of patients with CML-CP who receive dasatinib
100 mg once daily compared with 17% to 21% of
patients who receive 70 mg twice daily17,21 (Table 3). In
patients with advanced CML, grade 3/4 anemia is
reported in 50% to 69%.18,19 Interruption/reduction and
erythrocyte transfusion are routine practice. A single-institution study demonstrated that 9 of 15 dasatinib-treated
patients with grade 3/4 anemia who received erythropoietin or darbepoetin achieved hemoglobin increments 2
gm/dL.31 However, recent guidelines do not support the
use of erythropoietic-stimulating agents in patients with
myeloid malignancies.32
Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia (platelet level <50  109/L) is reported
in 22% of patients with CML-CP who receive 100 mg once
daily compared with approximately 40% to 50% of patients
who receive 70 mg twice daily (Table 3).16,17,21 In a singleinstitution study of patients with CML-CP, the median
time to grade 2, 3, or 4 thrombocytopenia with dasatinib (n
¼ 33) was 28 days (range, 11-368 days).31 Among patients
with advanced CML or Ph-positive ALL, grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia was observed in 78% to 88%.18-20 After grade
3/4 thrombocytopenia in patients with CML-CP, dasatinib
should be interrupted until the platelet count returns to
50  109/L (Table 4).23,24 In patients with advanced disease, the cause of thrombocytopenia (dasatinib-induced vs
leukemic proliferation) should be investigated before interruption. Platelet transfusions usually are recommended
when platelet levels are lower than 10 to 20  109/L.
Preliminary data suggest that interleukin-11 (oprelvekin;
10 lg/kg 3 times weekly) may assist with managing
thrombocytopenic patients.31
1388

Bleeding episodes occur in 21% of dasatinib-treated
patients, and 6% of those episodes are grade 3/4 and usually
are associated with severe thrombocytopenia.23 However, in
a single-institution study, 37% of bleeding episodes (any
grade) occurred in patients without thrombocytopenia.33
Severe central nervous system or GI bleeding occurred in
<1% and 4% of patients, respectively. Other types of bleeding include vaginal bleeding, gingival bleeding, and epistaxis. Among 48 patients, the median time to a bleeding
event was 6 weeks (range, 0.5-38 weeks), 69% of episodes
occurred during the first 3 months, and bleeding was less
frequent with dasatinib 100 mg daily (14%) than with 140
mg daily (25%).33 Platelet dysfunction in vitro has been
reported in dasatinib-treated patients,34 and dasatinib
should be used with caution in patients who are receiving
anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors. Holding dasatinib and
supporting with erythrocyte and/or platelet transfusions are
recommended if bleeding occurs.

Pleural Effusion
Pleural effusions during dasatinib treatment are dose/
schedule dependent and are more common in patients
with advanced disease. After thoracentesis, effusions are
identified as nonmalignant and commonly exudative
(80%).35 During dasatinib clinical trials, routine chest
x-rays were performed according to protocol design and
asymptomatic (grade 1), clinically nonsignificant pleural
effusions were identified in some patients. National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria grades for
pleural effusions are: grade 2, symptomatic requiring diuretic intervention or 2 therapeutic thoracenteses; grade
3, symptomatic requiring supplemental oxygen, 3 thoracenteses, tube drainage, or pleurodesis; and grade 4, lifethreatening with hemodynamic instability, or requiring
ventilatory support.
In patients with CML-CP, dasatinib 100 mg once
daily is associated with a lower rate of pleural effusions
(any grade, 10%; grade 3/4, 2%) than 70 mg twice daily
(any grade, 17%-27%; grade 3/4, 4%-6%) (Table
3).16,17,21 During the START-C or START-R trials, no
grade 4 pleural effusions were reported. In patients with
advanced CML or Ph-positive ALL who received 70 mg
twice daily, pleural effusions occurred in 13% to 36%
(grade 3/4, 5%-15%). In patients with advanced disease,
140 mg once daily was associated with a significantly

Practical Considerations for Dasatinib/Khoury et al

lower rate of pleural effusions than the approved 70 mg
twice daily schedule (17% vs 27%; P ¼ .005).25
Two independent studies of dasatinib-associated
pleural effusions (all phases of CML) have been published. In a study at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
(M. D. Anderson), the median time to pleural effusion in
48 of 138 patients who developed this complication was 5
weeks (range, 1-107 weeks), and effusions occurred
within 1 year of treatment in 90% of patients.35 The independent risk factors identified in that study were a history
of cardiac disease (P ¼ .02), hypertension (P ¼ .01), and
twice-daily versus once-daily schedule (P ¼ .05). In a
study by the Hammersmith group, the median time to
pleural effusion in 62 patients was 26 weeks (range, 3-108
weeks).36 The independent risk factors identified in that
study were a history of skin rash on imatinib (P ¼ .001),
autoimmune disease (P ¼ .015), and hypercholesterolemia (P ¼ .037). In both studies, advanced disease was predictive of pleural effusion in univariate analysis but not in
multivariate analysis.
Pleural effusions should be suspected when patients
present with dry cough, chest tightness, or shortness of
breath. Dasatinib-associated dyspnea occurs in 20% of
patients (grade 3/4, 4%)23 and often is associated with
pleural effusions. Some patients report a positional dry
cough (when supine or bending forward). A chest x-ray
will diagnose the pleural effusion and provide a baseline
assessment for management.
Currently, to our knowledge, no clinical studies
have compared the relative effectiveness and contribution
of different interventions for dasatinib-associated pleural
effusions. After patients develop grade 1 pleural effusion,
no treatment modification is recommended, but more
frequent chest x-ray monitoring is required. Options for
managing grade 2 effusions include temporary dasatinib
interruption until resolution (or grade 1) and supportive
care with diuretics. Short courses of steroids (prednisone
20-40 mg for 3-4 days) have been advocated, although the
clinical value remains unproven. Large or recurrent effusions may require thoracentesis. A dose reduction or
change (once daily) may be beneficial. Among 48 of 138
dasatinib-treated patients who experienced effusions in
the M. D. Anderson study, 40 patients (83%) had a treatment interruption, and 34 patients (71%) had a dose
reduction.35 The median interruption lasted 27 days
(range, 4-113 days). In the M. D. Anderson study, addiCancer

April 1, 2009

tional interventions included diuretics (71%), pulse steroids (27%), and thoracentesis (19%). Pleural effusions
recurred after resuming dasatinib in 29% and led to
discontinuation in 6%.
The pathogenesis of dasatinib-associated pleural
effusions remains to be established. One hypothesis has
implicated dasatinib inhibition of PDGFR-b, which is
involved in the regulation of tissue interstitial fluid pressure.35,37 During a phase 2 trial of a novel PDGFR-b–
blocking agent (CDP860), patients with solid tumors
experienced fluid retention and pleural effusions with
rapid onset.38 Supporting this hypothesis, imatinib has a
weaker inhibitory effect on PDGFR-b than dasatinib and
rarely is associated with pleural effusions. In addition,
dasatinib inhibition of Src family kinases (Src or Yes) may
increase the permeability of pleural/pulmonary vasculature through the inhibition of cell-cell adhesion or vascular endothelial growth factor-induced responses.35,39,40
However, other dual Bcr-Abl/Src inhibitors, such as bosutinib, have not been associated with pleural effusions;
notably, bosutinib has limited inhibition of PDGFR-b.41
Alternatively, because pleural fluids predominantly are
exudative with frequent lymphocyte infiltration,35,42 effusions may result from a hypersensitivity or other immunemediated reaction to dasatinib rather than fluid
retention.42 This latter hypothesis is supported by the
observation that immune-mediated characteristics, such
as rash on prior imatinib or a history of autoimmunity,
have been identified as risk factors.36 However, data to
confirm any of these hypotheses are lacking.

Other Fluid Retention-related Events
Peripheral edema was reported in 10% to 22% of patients
across dasatinib trials and was grade 1/2 in almost all
patients (Table 3). In the START-R trial, dasatinib-treated
patients experienced lower rates of superficial edema (15%
vs 42%), peripheral edema (10% vs 20%), and facial edema
(4% vs 10%) compared with high-dose imatinib-treated
patients, with no grade 3/4 events.16 Other fluid retention
events, including pericardial effusion, pulmonary edema,
pulmonary hypertension, ascites, and generalized edema,
have been reported infrequently during dasatinib trials (all
grades, 3% of patients for each AE; grade 3/4, 1%).23 It
has been suggested that fluid retention-related AEs also may
be the result of PDGFR inhibition,16,43 although the higher
1389

Review Article

incidence of peripheral edema and other manifestations of
fluid retention (eg, periorbital edema) with imatinib compared with dasatinib is not consistent with its less potent
PDGFR inhibition. Fluid retention AEs should be managed
similar to pleural effusion, ie, temporary dose interruption/
reduction and diuretics.

nausea, and antiemetic medications. Treatment interruption/reduction should be considered for grade 3/4 GI
symptoms that do not resolve with standard management.
Any patients with GI bleeding, as discussed above, should
be managed through treatment interruption (Table 4).
Because the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib are not affected
by food,23,24 tablets may be taken with a meal.

Cardiac Dysfunction
Patients who are receiving dasatinib have a very low incidence of cardiac dysfunction or toxicity. The overall incidence of dasatinib-associated congestive heart failure or
cardiac dysfunction was 2% (grade 3/4, 1%).23,24 There
have been no reported sudden deaths attributable to dasatinib-related or -suspected arrhythmia. In all dasatinib trials, patients frequently were monitored with routine
electrocardiograms. In single-arm dasatinib trials in
patients with leukemia, the mean QTc interval changes
from baseline using the Fridericia method (QTcF) were 3
to 6 msec, and the upper 95% confidence intervals for all
mean changes from baseline were <8 msec. Three patients
(<1%) experienced a QTcF >500 msec, although none
of those patients had clinical symptoms. Nine patients
had QTc prolongation reported as an AE (7 episodes were
considered drug related). Patients were managed through
dose interruption in 5 patients followed by dose reduction
in 3 patients, and 1 patient discontinued treatment. Dasatinib should be administered with caution to patients who
are at risk for QTc prolongation, including patients with
hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; patients with congenital long QT syndrome; and patients who are taking antiarrhythmic medicines, other medicinal products that may
lead to QT prolongation, or cumulative high-dose anthracycline therapy. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should
be corrected before dasatinib administration.23,24

Gastrointestinal Disturbances
Across all trials of dasatinib, 31% of patients experienced diarrhea, 22% experienced nausea, and 13% experienced
vomiting, and these AEs commonly were mild to moderate
in severity (Table 3).23 In the START-R trial, nausea (24%
vs 33%) and vomiting (9% vs 24%) were less common with
dasatinib than with imatinib 800 mg, although diarrhea was
more common with dasatinib (35% vs 29%).16 Common
practice for managing GI events involves antidiarrhea, anti1390

Rash
Rash and other dermatologic problems have been associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, although
patients who develop a rash on imatinib do not appear to
experience a recurrence on dasatinib.30 Across all dasatinib trials, skin toxicity was reported in 22% of patients
(grade 3/4, 1%).23 Dasatinib-associated rashes resolve
with drug discontinuation and, unlike allergic rashes, may
not recur when the drug is restarted, particularly with a
reduced dose. Mild rashes can be managed with antihistamines or topical steroids. Treatment interruption may be
required for more severe cases, and short courses of systemic corticosteroids may expedite rash resolution before
restarting therapy, usually at a lower dose.
Biochemical Abnormalities
Grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia with dasatinib has been
reported in 10% of patients with CML-CP and in 12% to
20% patients with advanced CML or Ph-positive ALL
and usually responds to adequate supplementation with
available oral supplements and/or phosphorus-rich food
products (eg, yoghurt, milk, salmon, or lentils). The incidence of grade 3/4 hypocalcemia was 2% in patients with
CML-CP and 7% to 11% in patients with advanced
CML/Ph-positive ALL. These episodes have been managed successfully with oral calcium supplementation.
Grade 3/4 elevations of transaminases or bilirubin occur
infrequently with dasatinib in patients with CML-CP
(1% of patients) but are slightly more common in patients
with advanced disease (3%-7%). Grade 3/4 biochemical
abnormalities require dose interruption and then dose
reduction once the abnormality resolves to grade 1.23,24
Other Adverse Events
Mild-to-moderate headache (24%) and fatigue (21%) are
common during dasatinib therapy (Table 3) and, in

high-dose imatinib. Headache generally can be managed
with standard analgesics and rarely requires treatment
modifications. Muscle cramps are common with imatinib
(38% incidence in the IRIS trial)44 but are uncommon
with dasatinib (2% in the START-R trial vs 12% for
high-dose imatinib)16 and can be managed with quinine
(or tonic water) or calcium gluconate. Bone pain and
arthralgias also are uncommon with dasatinib treatment.
For any AE that requires clinical intervention, temporary
dose interruption should be considered (Table 4).

Dose Adjustments, Interruptions, and
Treatment Discontinuations
For patients with CML-CP, dasatinib 100 mg once daily
is associated with fewer dose reductions (33% vs 57%),
interruptions (58% vs 71%), and discontinuations (22%
vs 32%) than 70 mg twice daily (Table 5). In addition,
fewer patients discontinued dasatinib 100 mg once daily
after drug intolerance (6% vs 15% with 70 mg twice
daily)21 Variable rates of dose adjustments have been
reported in patients with advanced CML or Ph-positive
ALL who were receiving dasatinib 70 mg twice daily (Table 5). Although the discontinuation rates were higher
than in patients with CML-CP (52%-94%), rates of discontinuation because of drug toxicity were low (4%10%).18-20 In the CA180-035 trial, fewer patients with

once daily required dose reductions (29% vs 39%; P ¼

compared with patients who received 70 mg twice daily,
although dose escalations were significantly more
common (34% vs 23%; P ¼ .004).25

Dasatinib Therapy for Pediatric Patients
The efficacy and safety of dasatinib in patients aged <18
years have not been established, although, in a preliminary
phase 1/2 pediatric study in CML and Ph-positive ALL,
treatment responses were observed with doses of 60 mg/
m2 and 80 mg/m2 administered once daily, and doserelated exposure was observed between these dosing levels.45 No drug accumulation was apparent. Overall, dasatinib generally was tolerated well, treatment-related grade
3/4 cytopenias occurred infrequently (<10%), and most
nonhematologic toxicities were graded mild to moderate.
In a separate pediatric study, a dasatinib dose of 85 mg/
m2 administered twice daily has been selected for further
investigation in pediatric patients after demonstrating
good preliminary tolerability.46 Pharmacokinetic analysis
suggested a shorter half-life in children than in adults.

Potential Drug Interactions with Dasatinib
Because dasatinib is a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)
substrate, other agents that are CYP3A4 substrates or that
inhibit or induce CYP3A4 activity have the potential to

to 2 h before or after dasatinib (eg, aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesia)
Aspirin, warfarin sodium

interact with dasatinib (Table 6).10,23,24 For example, the
mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the
mean area under the curve (AUC) of simvastatin, which is
a CYP3A4 substrate, increased by 37% and 20%, respectively, after the coadministration of a single 100-mg dasatinib dose to 54 healthy individuals. Therefore, CYP3A4
substrates with a narrow therapeutic index should be
administered with caution. CYP3A4 inducers may
decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations; after 8 days of
treatment with the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin,
the mean dasatinib Cmax/AUC decreased by approximately 80%. Dasatinib plasma concentrations may be
increased by CYP3A4 inhibitors; in 18 patients with solid
tumors who received coadministered ketoconazole 200
mg twice daily (a CYP3A4 inhibitor), dasatinib Cmax and
AUC values increased by 4- and 5-fold, respectively.
When possible, the concomitant administration of dasatinib with CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors should be
avoided, and alternative agents should be considered. If a
CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, then a washout period
of approximately 1 week should be allowed before the
dasatinib dose is increased.
Because the solubility of dasatinib is pH-dependent,
the suppression of gastric acid secretion by H2 antagonists
or proton pump inhibitors is likely to reduce dasatinib exposure. Among 24 healthy individuals, a single dose of
dasatinib 50 mg administered 10 hours after famotidine
reduced the dasatinib Cmax and AUC by 63% and 61%,
respectively. Because the concomitant use of H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors with dasatinib is not
1392

recommended, antacids taken at least 2 hours before or after dasatinib dosing should be considered instead.23,24

Contraindications for Dasatinib
There are no absolute contraindications for the use of
dasatinib. However, given the risks of bleeding associated
with dasatinib, patients who are receiving anticoagulation
or agents that may impair platelet function (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents) should be monitored carefully for bleeding complications. The development of skin
rash does not preclude patients from resuming dasatinib
after resolution, assuming the rash was not life-threatening (Stevens-Johnson syndrome). Resumption of therapy
usually is done at lower doses, and patients should be
monitored carefully when they restart treatment. One
report suggested that patients who have advanced phases
of CML, hypertension, or a history of cardiac disease may
have a higher risk of developing a pleural effusion.35
Although risk factors have not been confirmed by others,
such patients most likely should be monitored carefully
for clinical signs of pleural effusion. Patients who develop
intolerance to dasatinib despite optimal symptom management and dose adjustments have the options of receiving nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis) or enrolling onto clinical
trials (bosutinib, others).
In conclusion, dasatinib is an effective treatment for
patients with CML or Ph-positive ALL who are resistant
or intolerant to imatinib. Overall, dasatinib is well tolerated, and the majority of treatment-related AEs are mild

to moderate. Dasatinib-associated AEs, including cytopenias and pleural effusions, usually are reversible and manageable with supportive measures and can be minimized
through once-daily dosing (100 mg once daily) for CMLCP. Rates of dasatinib discontinuation because of drug
toxicity are low, and there is no evidence of cross intolerance with imatinib. As with any anticancer medication,
careful monitoring and management of AEs is essential so
that patients receive continuing benefits from treatment.
Optimal dosing as well as early recognition and effective
management of side effects may help to reduce treatment
interruptions, dose reductions, and discontinuations, thus
offering patients longer exposure, which is most conducive for an optimal and durable response.
