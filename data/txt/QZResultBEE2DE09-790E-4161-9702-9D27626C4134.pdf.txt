BACKGROUND. The aim of this study was to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis during periods of neutropenia reduced streptococcal (S. viridans) sepsis and
overall bacterial sepsis.

METHODS. The authors reviewed outcomes of 78 evaluable patients who were
consecutively treated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) from October 2002
through January 2007. Several successive prophylactic antibiotic regimens were
used. All patients received antifungal prophylaxis with oral voriconazole.

RESULTS. Oral cephalosporins did not significantly reduce the odds of bacterial
sepsis (P 5 .81) or streptococcal (S. viridans) sepsis (P 5 .90) relative to no prophylaxis. Intravenous (iv) cefepime completely prevented streptococcal (S. virid-

ans) sepsis and reduced the odds of bacterial sepsis 91% (P < .0001) relative to
no prophylaxis, but resistant gram-negative bacteria emerged in 2 patients. Vancomycin with oral ciprofloxacin or a cephalosporin reduced the odds of bacterial
sepsis by 93% (P < .0001) and streptococcal (S. viridans) sepsis by 99%
(P < .0001). The fungal infection rate did not differ significantly between patients
who did and did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis (1.0 per 1000 patient-days for
both groups). The observed reduction in average hospital days per chemotherapy
course for patients given vancomycin regimens or cefepime was 5.7 (P < .0001)
and 4.1 (P 5 .0039) days, respectively. No reduction was observed with oral cephalosporins (P 5 .10). Furthermore, vancomycin regimens or cefepime were associated with a 20% reduction in healthcare charges (P 5 .0015) relative to using no
antibiotics. One patient, who was on oral cefuroxime alone, died of septicemia.

CONCLUSIONS. Prophylaxis with intravenous cefepime or a vancomycin regimen,
and voriconazole, reduced morbidity in children with AML, and resulted
in dramatic decreases in the incidence of septicemia and hospitalization days.

ntensive chemotherapy for the treatment of childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has improved remission induction and longterm cure rates.1–3 Treatment outcomes have also been positively
influenced by the increased use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and advances in supportive care. However, these
successes have been tempered by the continued presence of
significant treatment-related toxicity.4–6 The heterogeneous viridans
streptococci (S. viridans), which commonly colonize the oral, gastrointestinal, and vaginal mucosa, are an important cause of sepsis
and pneumonia in neutropenic children and adolescents and are
particularly troublesome in patients who are undergoing therapy for
AML.7–10 Increased risk of S. viridans sepsis and pneumonia is

thought to be due, at least in part, to high-dose
cytarabine used to treat AML.7–10 For example, S. viridans accounted for 21% of all bacteremia events
among children and adolescents with AML treated
on the CCG-2891 study.8 Several studies have also
found an increased risk of recurrence of S. viridans
bacteremia (as high as 71% in 1 report).8–10 Moreover, we and others have previously reported that S.
viridans sepsis is associated with a high rate of lifethreatening complications. At our institution, almost
two thirds of patients required intensive care, more
than one third experienced acute respiratory distress
syndrome, and about one fifth required vasopressor
support.11 Similarly, 69% to 80% of patients with S.
viridans sepsis treated on CCG 2961 were reported to
have any grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity.12 Mortality due
to S. viridans sepsis is also significant. In an analysis
of data from the AML-BFM 93 clinical trial, 7.1% of
patients with a diagnosed S. viridans bloodstream
infection died.13 Thus, the administration of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with AML to prevent
adverse outcomes due to infection may be warranted.
Here we describe the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce treatment-associated morbidity and
mortality in neutropenic patients with AML. The primary objective of the study was to investigate the
effectiveness of various prophylactic antibiotic regimens in reducing systemic bacterial infection and S.
viridans sepsis in particular. A secondary aim was to
assess the impact of antibiotic prophylaxis on the
days of hospitalization during AML therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
After diagnosis and classification by standard morphologic, immunologic, and genetic testing, 85
patients with AML were enrolled in our clinical trial
(AML02) at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital
from October 1, 2002 to January 31, 2007. We performed a retrospective chart review for these 85 consecutively enrolled patients. We excluded patients
with biphenotypic leukemia treated with lymphoiddirected therapy (2 patients), those who had not
completed at least 1 chemotherapy course (1 patient),
and those receiving antibiotics for other reasons
throughout their entire AML treatment period (4
patients). Written informed consent was obtained
from patients, their parents, or their legal guardians.
Approval by the St. Jude institutional review board
was obtained for both the therapeutic clinical trial
and the present retrospective cohort study. Data on
the use of antibiotics and incidence of infection were

withdrawal from the AML study, or death and, thus,
were not included in statistical analyses. In addition,
courses during which a patient received antibiotics
for other reasons were considered nonevaluable.

Treatment of AML
On the AML02 protocol (Table 1), patients are randomly assigned to receive either high-dose or lowdose cytarabine with doxorubicin and etoposide (collectively known as ADE) during induction I therapy.
During induction II, patients with minimal residual
disease level <1% receive ADE, whereas those with
a level 1% receive ADE and gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Patients whose AML enters remission after
induction II therapy undergo HSCT or receive 3
courses of cytarabine-based consolidation chemotherapy. Low-risk patients, ie, those with t(8;21),
inv(16), or t(9;11),14,15 receive chemotherapy,
whereas high-risk patients, ie, those with monosomy
7, FLT3-ITD, t(6;9), or treatment-related or myelodysplastic syndrome-related AML,14,16–19 are candidates for HSCT. All others are classified as standard
risk and receive HSCT only when they have a
matched sibling donor.
Use of Prophylactic Antibiotics
Because of our previous experiences and reports in
the literature on S. viridans infections among chil-

dren treated for AML, we investigated the use of prophylactic antibiotics for these patients. We define
prophylactic antibiotics as those antimicrobial agents
administered to patients at the onset of neutropenia
without any signs of infection, including fever. The
proposed strategies were modified on the basis of
short-term findings; thus, several consecutive strategies of antibiotic prophylaxis were implemented.
These institutional changes in prophylactic antibiotic
recommendations impacted the prophylaxis regimen
that patients received for the subsequent chemotherapy courses. Oral cephalosporins were introduced
first, followed by the use of cefepime, 1500 mg/m2
given intravenously (iv) every 12 hours. Finally, we
used vancomycin, 400 mg/m2 given iv every 12
hours, in combination with any 1 of the following:
oral ciprofloxacin (250 to 350 mg/m2 given every 12
hours), an oral cephalosporin, or cefepime (1500 mg/
m2 iv every 12 hours). Specific dosing schedules for
prophylactic antibiotics were chosen on the basis of
the experience and opinion of our infectious disease
specialists. Prophylactic antibiotics were administered after myelosuppressive therapy when a patient
became neutropenic (absolute neutrophil count
[ANC] 500/lL) and discontinued when the ANC
recovered to greater than 100/lL and was rising.
During outpatient antibiotic therapy, patients stayed
either at their local residences or were housed in
local domiciliary apartments. Parents were appropriately trained to give home infusions of antibiotics.
All patients received antifungal prophylaxis that
consisted of voriconazole and Pneumocystis jiroveci
prophylaxis that consisted of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Prophylactic use of voriconazole, 4 mg/
kg administered orally every 12 hours, began at the
time of diagnosis and continued until the end of
therapy, but administration of voriconazole was held
on days that patients received daunorubicin, etoposide, or mitoxantrone. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was not routinely given.
Blood cultures were routinely obtained from the
central venous catheter and a peripheral vein when
patients had fever (defined as an oral temperature of
38.08C that persisted for at least 1 hour or a single
temperature 38.38C). A diagnosis of bacterial sepsis
required isolation of bacteria from blood cultures
and clinical signs of systemic infection (ie, fever as
defined previously or hypothermia <36.08C with a
heart rate greater than the 95th percentile for age, respiratory rate greater than the 95th percentile for
age, or blood pressure below the 5th percentile for
age). Common skin microorganisms were considered
pathogens (rather than contaminants) when they
were isolated from at least 2 blood cultures.20

Patients admitted for fever and neutropenia were
treated empirically with vancomycin and cefepime,
or vancomycin and meropenem when they had been
receiving cefepime prophylaxis. All patients routinely
underwent surveillance cultures of the nares and rectum with every hospital admission.

Estimation of Health Care Savings
We obtained all hospitalization and outpatient charge
data for all 78 evaluable patients in the study, regardless of the encounter reason. The charge data consisted of a list of healthcare services with a charge, a
start date, and end date. We identified all services
with date periods coinciding with the dates of each
patient course. We then assigned a percentage of
each matching charge item to the course according
to the percentage of days that the item fell within
the designated course. Finally, total charges for each
course were computed as the sum of the product of
each item’s charge with the percentage of days overlapping the course. Utility measures (quality of life or
patient preferences) were not considered for this
analysis.
Statistical Analysis
We used statistical models to explore the association
of antibiotic regimens with sepsis occurrence and
length of stay while adjusting for chemotherapy
course. We used a generalized estimating equations
approach21 to fit a longitudinal logistic regression
model of the occurrence of bacterial sepsis during
each course of therapy. Main effects for prophylactic
treatment and chemotherapy course were included.
Because there were no infections associated with the
vancomycin-cefepime regimen, we combined all
vancomycin-containing regimens together for the
analysis of overall bacterial sepsis. Similarly, for the
analysis of S. viridans sepsis, the cefepime regimen
was combined with all vancomycin-containing regimens because of the small number of events. To analyze the average number of hospital days and
healthcare charges, we fitted a repeated-measures
mixed model based on the normal distribution, taking into account the main effects of treatment and
chemotherapy course and modeling the correlation
with an autoregressive structure. Charge data were
log transformed. Analyses were performed by using
SAS software, Windows version 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).

A total of 75 organisms were isolated during 70 episodes of bacterial sepsis; 65 episodes were caused
by a single pathogen, whereas 5 episodes were caused by 2 microorganisms.

coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (not included
above) were considered contaminants and were
excluded from the analysis.
Rates of bacterial and S. viridans sepsis in relation to prophylactic antibiotic regimens are depicted
in Figure 1. Compared with patients who received no
antibiotic prophylaxis, patients who received oral
cephalosporins alone did not have a significant
reduction in the occurrence of bacterial septicemia
(P 5 .81) or S. viridans septicemia (P 5 .90) after
adjustment for chemotherapy course. In contrast, the
use of any vancomycin-containing regimen or iv
cefepime, when compared with no prophylaxis,
resulted in substantial reductions in the odds of
overall bacterial sepsis and S. viridans sepsis. After
adjusting for chemotherapy course, we found that
cefepime reduced the odds of bacterial sepsis by 91%
(95% CI, 72% to 97%; P < .0001) relative to no prophylaxis. We did not observe any S. viridans sepsis
among patients who were receiving cefepime. However, gram-negative infections developed in 2
patients who were receiving cefepime prophylaxis: 1
patient had Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the other
patient had Escherichia coli. Both organisms were resistant to cefepime but susceptible to ciprofloxacin. In
addition, 1 patient developed Bacillus cereus sepsis
while receiving cefepime. Regimens containing vancomycin or iv cefepime reduced the odds of bacterial
sepsis by 93% (95% CI, 85% to 97%; P < .0001) relative

to no prophylaxis. Similarly, the odds of S. viridans
sepsis decreased by 98.5% (95% CI, 88% to 99.8%;
P < .0001) when a vancomycin-containing regimen
or iv cefepime was administered.
Fungal infection rates did not differ significantly
between patients who did and did not receive prophylactic antibiotics (1.0 episode per 1000 patientdays for both groups). In the entire cohort of 78
patients, we identified 3 proven and 2 possible fungal
infections. Two patients had small pulmonary
nodules detected by computed tomography, a finding
consistent with possible Candida infection; 2 patients
developed fungal skin infections (Fusarium species
in 1 case and Bipolaris species in the other), and 1
patient developed invasive Fusarium sinusitis and
pneumonia. All fungal infections resolved in
response to aggressive antifungal therapy, which
included posaconazole and granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor in the 3 cases of proven
infection. Although there were no fatal fungal infections, 2 patients died of infectious complications: 1
patient who was receiving oral cefuroxime alone died
of Bacillus cereus sepsis after induction II, and 1
infant died of respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia
after completing all 5 courses of chemotherapy.
We observed that use of antibiotic regimens had
a meaningful impact on days of hospitalization. The
average number of hospital days per course for
patients receiving no prophylactic antibiotics, an oral
cephalosporin alone, intravenous cefepime, or regimens containing vancomycin were 16.1 days (range,

5-28 days), 10.8 days (range, 5-23 days), 11.3 days
(range, 1-35 days), and 8.7 days (range, 0-32 days),
respectively. After adjusting for chemotherapy course,
the average hospital days per course were reduced
by 5.7 days for those given a vancomycin-containing
regimen (95% CI, 3.4-8.1; P < .0001) and 4.1 days for
those who received cefepime (95% CI, 1.3-6.9; P 5
.0039) relative to no prophylaxis. Use of an oral
cephalosporin did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the days of hospitalization compared with no prophylaxis (P 5 .10).
We found that prophylactic antibiotic use was
associated with considerable reductions in healthcare
charges. The median daily charges for inpatient care
totaled approximately $3055 (US dollars), compared
with $571 for daily outpatient charges. Depending on
the prophylactic antibiotics given, an additional $76
to $150 was charged by the infusion company for
home administration of intravenous medications.
After adjusting for the effects of chemotherapy
course, oral cephalosporin administration was not
associated with a reduction in healthcare charges (P
5 .19). However, use of iv cefepime or a vancomycin-containing regimen was associated with a 20%
reduction in total cost-of-care per course (P 5 .0015;
95% CI, 9% to 30%) relative to using no antibiotics.
These savings are substantial, considering that the
median total cost-of-care per course was $52,218
(range, $5976 to $321,375).

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we observed no deaths due to
bacterial or fungal infections among patients with
AML who received effective prophylactic antibiotics
and antifungal agents. The only death related to bacterial infection (caused by Bacillus cereus) occurred
in 1 patient who was on oral cefuroxime alone, a regimen found to be ineffective at reducing the risk of
bacterial sepsis. One other infant died of an overwhelming respiratory syncytial virus infection after
the completion of chemotherapy. Our results indicate
that the prophylactic use of cefepime or a vancomycin-containing regimen in children and adolescents
with AML who are receiving intensive chemotherapy
dramatically reduces the incidence of bacterial sepsis
and S. viridans sepsis in particular. In addition, the
use of prophylactic antibiotics, when compared with
no prophylaxis, resulted in roughly a 5-day decrease
in the average hospital days per course.
Although the goal of prophylactic antibiotic
administration was not to reduce healthcare costs,
we observed that prophylactic antibiotic administration was associated with considerable healthcare sav-

Antibiotic Prophylaxis in Pediatric AML/Kurt et al.

ings. This corresponds to the decreased number of
hospital days per course noted among patient
courses where antibiotic prophylaxis was given.
As described in previous reports on children with
AML, gram-positive organisms represented the majority of bacterial bloodstream pathogens isolated from
our study cohort.13,22 Although fewer organisms were
isolated among patients who were receiving prophylaxis, the proportion of gram-positive isolates was not
substantially different between patients who received
prophylactic antibiotics and those who did not (60%
vs 63% of isolates, respectively). Among patient
courses in which no prophylactic antibiotics were
given, S. viridans were the most frequently isolated
organisms, accounting for 51.9% (27 of 52) of all bacterial sepsis episodes. Only 27.8% (5 of 18) of sepsis
episodes were attributable to S. viridans in patient
courses in which antibiotics were administered; all
but 1 of these episodes occurred in a patient who was
receiving only an oral cephalosporin.
This retrospective study spanned the course of 4
years. During this time, our institutional recommendations for prophylaxis underwent modifications
because of available information regarding the occurrence of bacterial sepsis in our patient population
and because of emerging information in the literature
on antibiotic prophylaxis. Oral cephalosporins were
used initially because of their broad-spectrum coverage of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms,
ease of administration, documented safety in children, and tolerability. Importantly, these antimicrobial
agents were chosen because it was thought that they
would have good activity against S. viridans. However,
in vitro susceptibility of S. viridans to cephalosporins
was not reflected in clinical efficacy, as some patients
developed bacterial sepsis (including S. viridans sepsis) despite prophylaxis. Therefore, recommendations
were made to administer prophylactic cefepime to
patients without any history of S. viridans sepsis and
vancomycin with cefepime to those with a history of
S. viridans infection. As our results indicate, these
regimens were highly effective at preventing any bacterial sepsis, but life-threatening infections (2 by resistant gram-negative bacteria and 1 by Bacillus
cereus) emerged in 3 patients who were receiving cefepime. In addition, we later observed the development
of Bacillus cereus sepsis in another patient with AML
who was enrolled on AML02 and was receiving cefepime, but who was not part of the present retrospective study. In response to these developments,
vancomycin with oral ciprofloxacin became the prophylactic regimen of choice. Ciprofloxacin was
selected because it provides broad-spectrum coverage
and was not part of the recommended antimicrobial

381

regimen for initial treatment of febrile neutropenia in
our hospital. However, we did not consider the use of
ciprofloxacin alone, because quinolones as single
agents have been previously associated with an
increased incidence of S. viridans bacteremia and
decreased susceptibility to those agents.23
The use of antibiotic prophylaxis to decrease
neutropenia-related complications in patients with
cancer remains a controversial issue. Recent reports
have demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotics
reduce mortality, febrile episodes, and clinically or
microbiologically documented bacterial infection.24–26
However, prolonged administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics raises concern about the development of resistant enterococcal and fungal
infections.27,28 These outcomes were infrequent in
our patient population. During the 4-year period,
only 3 patients developed vancomycin-resistant
Enterococcus (VRE) colonization (identified on surveillance rectal cultures); 2 of these patients had
received broad-spectrum antibiotics for prophylaxis
at the time of their positive rectal cultures. One colonized patient who was receiving vancomycin and
ciprofloxacin developed VRE bacteremia. We did not
detect an increase in the rate of fungal infections in
patients who were given prophylactic antibiotics.
In summary, children and adolescents with AML
are at risk of severe infectious complications as a
result of prolonged neutropenia. Our findings support the use of vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin or the
use of cefepime alone in these high-risk patients.
However, because we observed the development of 2
cases of gram-negative sepsis among patients who
were receiving cefepime, and because cefepime may
not prevent Bacillus cereus sepsis, we recommend
vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin for AML patients who
are receiving chemotherapy. This regimen, which is
easily administered via central venous catheters by
the patients or their parents on an outpatient basis,
resulted in a substantial reduction in the incidence
of bacterial sepsis and decreased overall hospitalization time. In addition, the incidence of resistant bacterial infections or colonization was quite low. Thus,
the decreased morbidity from infectious complications as a result of antibiotic prophylaxis may justify
the potential risk from emerging resistant bacteria in
a cohort of patients at high risk for bacterial sepsis.
Because of the relatively small number of patients in
this study, additional studies are needed to confirm
our findings. Moreover, emergence of pathogens with
newly acquired resistance or changing patterns of
infection could alter the risk to benefit ratio. Thus,
continuing surveillance of infection and antibiotic
susceptibility patterns is prudent.
