ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy fails to provide durable cure for the majority of cancer patients.
To identify mechanisms associated with chemotherapy resistance, we identified
genes differentially expressed before and after chemotherapeutic treatment of breast
cancer patients. Treatment response resulted in either increased or decreased cell
cycle gene expression. Tumors in which cell cycle gene expression was increased by
chemotherapy were likely to be chemotherapy sensitive, whereas tumors in which
cell cycle gene transcripts were decreased by chemotherapy were resistant to these
agents. A gene expression signature that predicted these changes proved to be a
robust and novel index that predicted the response of patients with breast, ovarian,
and colon tumors to chemotherapy. Investigations in tumor cell lines supported these
findings, and linked treatment induced cell cycle changes with p53 signaling and
G1/G0 arrest. Hence, chemotherapy resistance, which can be predicted based on
dynamics in cell cycle gene expression, is associated with TP53 integrity.

Many studies focus on identifying gene signatures
to guide the selection of appropriate chemotherapy
regimens and to identify mechanisms of resistance
[5–10]. Such studies generally focus on identifying tumor
characteristics or genomic features measured in advance
of therapy that correlate with clinical responses. On the
other hand, few reports link the dynamics of the measured
feature over the course of treatment response. Examples
of the latter approach include reports linking endocrine
therapy induced reduction of Ki67 labeling as a predictive
factor of patient response and outcome [11, 12]. Indeed,
changes in Ki67 labeling index measured during treatment
is reportedly a superior predictor of response than similar
measurements taken prior to treatment [12].
Hence, we investigated neoadjuvant chemotherapyinduced changes of tumor-resident transcripts to identify

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer cases are increasing and represent
a leading cause of cancer death in women [1]. Despite
advances in endocrine and targeted therapies, cytotoxic
chemotherapies remain mainstays for breast cancer
(BC) treatment [2]. However, even potent multi-drug
regimens fail to provide long-term cure, especially in the
context of advanced disease. For example, combinatorial
Doxorubicin (Dx)/Taxotere (Tax) therapy results in
complete clinical response in some 20% of cases [3],
and provides long-term disease free survival for only
~60% of patients [3, 4]. Accordingly, there is a need for
understanding the cellular mechanisms that circumvent
chemotherapy efficacy, as well as to identify means to
predict which tumors are most likely to respond to therapy.

response and may reveal mechanisms of treatment
resistance.

treatment samples across all 26 tumors (Figure 1B). We
mapped these genes as nodes onto a protein interaction
network [14, 15], calculated correlation coefficients for all
interacting gene pairs, and assigned these as edges to the
network [15]. The weighted network was clustered to yield
sets of gene interaction modules. Each module comprised
sets of genes that are topologically close in a protein
interaction network, and also displayed highly coordinate
expression among pre/post exposed breast tumor samples.
We identified 4 modules individually comprising at least
10 genes with an average correlation that exceeded 0.5
(Figure 1C, Supplementary Table 1).
Independent pathway analyses on each of the
modules (Supplementary Table 2) revealed that Modules
0 and 3 were enriched in genes related to T- and B-cell
biology, respectively, whereas Module 2 was enriched
in genes associated with migratory processes such as
axon guidance, and angiogenesis mediated by VEGF and
VEGFR. Module 1 was enriched in genes exclusively
associated with cell cycle, and included well studied
regulators of cell cycle such as the centromere proteins

RESULTS
Treatment induced changes of cell cycle gene
expression predicts patient response
We sought to identify chemotherapy-induced
processes in breast tumors. We reasoned that changes in
gene expression resulting from chemotherapy exposure
might reveal mechanisms that underpin chemotherapy
sensitivity/resistance and identify biomarkers of treatment
response. To the latter end we compared published datasets
of global gene expression profiles of 26 matched pre/post
treatment breast tumor samples from patients that were
treated with an anthracycline and taxane (GSE28844
[13]) (Figure 1A), and identified transcripts with at
least a 2 fold expression difference between pre/post

CENPN, CENPF and CENPA that control the separation
of sister chromatids during mitosis, as well as BUB1B
and CDC20. Notably, proliferative processes have been
linked previously with chemotherapy response in breast
cancer patients [16–18].
Despite an established link between the cell cycle
and chemotherapy response, the mechanism(s) that
governs poor response has yet to be described. Hence we
investigated the expression changes of Module 1 genes
in the pre/post treatment biopsies. Intriguingly, a third of
tumors (n = 8) displayed near uniform up-regulation of
Module 1 genes in response to chemotherapy treatment
(Figure 2A), whereas the remaining two thirds (n = 18)
showed coordinate down-regulation of Module 1 genes.
Additional proliferation associated genes, Ki67, E2F1 and
AURKA, that were absent in Module 1, showed similar
expression changes among pre/post treatment samples
(Figure 2B), strengthening the association of Module 1
with the expression of proliferation-associated genes.
These analyses reveal that breast tumors exposed to
chemotherapy can be stratified into 2 subsets: 1) tumors
that down-regulate cell cycle genes; and 2) tumors that
up-regulate cell cycle genes. A comparison of the mean
expression level of Module 1 genes and average change in
expression levels revealed no correlation between levels
of cell cycle gene expression prior to treatment with those
found in post treatment tumors (Figure 2C, r = −0.1,
p = 0.60, Spearman’s rank correlation). A relationship
was also not identifiable between changes in Module
1 during treatment and pre-treatment levels of ki67
transcripts, another well-validated marker proliferation
(Supplementary Figure 1A; r = –0.14, p = 0.47).
We next determined whether changes in Module
1 gene expression during chemotherapy were associated
with treatment response. Briefly, we identified a gene
signature (Response Signature [RS]) that discriminated
between pre-treatment tumors that either up-regulated or
down regulated Module 1 genes in response to treatment,
and measured the capacity of the RS to predict tumor
response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. To generate the
RS, we identified the 10 genes with the largest differential
expression between the 6 pre-treatment tumor samples
that most highly up-regulated and down-regulated
Module 1 gene expression in response to treatment,
respectively (Supplementary Table 3). Receiver-operator
characteristics curve (ROC) analysis of these 12 patients
demonstrated that the RS was significantly associated
with whether or not chemotherapy altered Module 1 gene
expression in breast tumors (Supplementary Figure 2A,
AUC: 1.0, p = 0.004). Among the 14 patients that were
not used to identify the RS, we validated the capacity of
the RS to correctly predict how a tumor would respond to
treatment based on changes in Module 1 gene expression
(Supplementary Figure 2B, AUC: 0.84, *p = 0.04). Hence,
these data demonstrate that the RS can be evaluated on
pre-treatment tumor samples and subsequently used to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

prospectively identify tumors that would up- or downregulate Module 1 genes in response to chemotherapy.
Application of the RS to multiple cohorts of neoadjuvantly
treated breast cancer patients revealed a robust relationship
between RS and pathological response outcomes for each
of the cohorts that we tested (Figure 2D & 2E; 5 cohorts;
patient n = 1066; AUC > 0.5 and p < 0.05). Further, the
predictive nature of the RS could also identify response
to chemotherapy in colon and ovarian patient cohorts
(Figure 2D & 2E; Ovarian: n = 58, Colon: n = 37; AUC
> 0.5 and p < 0.05). In each cohort, higher signature
scores were significantly associated with resistance to
chemotherapy (Supplementary Figure 2C), strongly
suggesting that the treatment-induced down-regulation
of Module 1 genes is also associated with treatment
resistance.
A final analysis was conducted to investigate the
prognostic capacity of the RS while accounting for clinical
factors, by performing multivariate regression analyses in
a pooled breast cancer cohort, made by combining the 5
neoadjuvant breast cohorts presented above. Although the
pooled cohort comprised 1066 patients, only 895 patients
had complete clinical annotations including RS score,
grade, age, as well as ER and node status (summarized
in Supplementary Table 4). Univariate analysis revealed
that the RS signature (OR: 2.95 [2.14–4.08], p < 0.001),
ER status (OR: 0.20 [0.15–0.29], p < 0.001), and grade
(OR: 4.36 [3.00–6.34], p < 0.001) were all significant
prognosticators of response, whereas age and node status
were not. In the multivariate model, the RS signature
( p = 0.032), ER status ( p < 0.001) and grade ( p < 0.001)
all remained significantly associated with response
(Supplementary Table 5). Hence these data confirm that
the RS signature is a significant prognosticator of response
even after adjusting for standard clinical variables.
Together, these data suggest that exposure of breast,
ovarian or colorectal tumors to chemotherapy leads to
altered cell cycle gene expression. Decreased expression of
proliferation genes following patient treatment is associated
with chemotherapy resistance, whereas increased or no
change in the expression of proliferation genes after
chemotherapy predicts sensitivity to such agents.

Cell cycle integrity governs breast cancer cell
lines response to chemotherapy
To establish a mechanism(s) that links altered
proliferation gene expression and chemotherapy
resistance, we treated 9 different breast cancer cell lines
with Dx, an anthracycline (100 nM for 2 days), and
measured cell cycle response by staining for markers
of cell proliferation (Ki67) and cell cycle arrest (p21).
The cell lines displayed 2 distinct behaviors: those in
which Ki67 expression was decreased (MCF7, BT474,
MDA-MB-361, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-175VII), and
those in which Ki67 was increased or unchanged (T47D,

for p21 typically demonstrated the converse trend (Figure
3B). Moreover, re-analysis of published microarray based
gene expression profiling of control and Dx treated MCF7
cells [19], revealed near uniform (8/10) down-regulation of
Module 1 genes in response to Dx, further supporting the
capacity of cell lines to model our previous observations
made in breast tumors (Supplementary Figure 3).
We extended these findings using the H2BGFPFUCCI cell cycle reporter [20, 21] that encodes a fusion
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of H2B-GFP, which decorates chromatin, and mKO2-Cdt1
(herein referred to as FUCCI-G1) [21], the expression of
which is restricted to G1/G0. Live cell imaging over the
course of 3 days following Dx treatment showed that,
although all cell lines displayed a marked decrease in
proliferation, nearly all MCF7, BT474 and MDA-MB-361
cells increased or maintained expression of the FUCCI-G1
reporter 24 hours after treatment, whereas the fraction
of T47D, MDA-MB-231 or HCC1945 cells expressing
FUCCI-G1 remained constant or decreased (Figure

4A & Supplementary Figures 4A–4F). Importantly,
the results were consistent across a range of Dx doses,
including previously defined IC50 doses for each line
(Supplementary Figure 5A) (10). Single cell tracking
of the reporter cell lines revealed that Dx treated MCF7
and BT474 cells yielded non-dividing cells that were
nearly all arrested in the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle
(Figures 4B–4C & Supplementary Figure 5B). In contrast,
Dx treatment of T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells lead to
increased apoptosis, and non-dividing cells that did not
express FUCCI-G1 (Figures 4B–4C & Supplementary
Figure 5B). In addition to using the FUCCI-G1 reporter,
we also employed BrDU staining to monitor cell cycle
status. BrDU incorporation in Dx treatment of MCF7 and
MDA-MD-231 cells confirmed our observation that Dx
induced MCF7 G1 arrest, whereas MDA-MB-231 cells
arrested primarily in G2/M (Supplementary Figure 5C). In
sum, some breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, BT474, MDAMB-361, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-175VII) phenocopied
tumors that down-regulated cell cycle gene expression in
response to treatment, whereas other lines (T47D, MDAMB-231, HCC1954 and BT-549) were similar to those that
increase cell cycle gene expression after treatment.
To identify the mechanism(s) that regulate
chemotherapy-induced cell cycle gene changes, we
performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

publically available gene expression profiles of Dx treated
MCF7 cells, which identified enrichment for multiple p53
related gene sets (Supplementary Table 6; bolded gene
sets) [22]. The latter is in keeping with the fact that MCF7
cells harbor WTp53 alleles [23, 24], and is consistent with
the fact that Dx treatment of these cells activated G1/G0
arrest via functional p53 signaling.
We hypothesized that the two distinct cell cycle
response patterns observed in our panel of H2BGFPFUCCI expressing cell lines might be related to their
TP53 status, as p53 mediates G1/G0 cell cycle arrest in
response to DNA damage [25, 26]. We performed timelapse imaging of H2BGFP-FUCCI cell lines grown in
the absence or presence of the small molecule Nutlin3A,
an inhibitor of the interaction of p53 with MDM2.
MDM2 targets p53 for degradation and hence Nutlin3A
activates p53 signaling in cell lines that harbor the WTp53
alleles. Nutlin3A elicited growth arrest and FUCCI-G1
expression or Ki67 loss in the same lines (MCF7, BT474,
MDA-MB-361, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-175VII) that
were arrested in G1/G0 in response to Dx exposure
(Supplementary Figures 6A–6D). However, Nutlin3A, like
Dx, did not effect G1/G0 cell cycle arrest in the T47D,
MDA-MB-231, HCC1945 or BT-549 cell lines, which
harbor mutant TP53 alleles. These results were further
confirmed by BrDU incorporation analysis in MCF7 and

tumor harbored mutant TP53 had significantly higher p53
signature scores than those with WT TP53 (Figure 5A,
t-test, *p < 0.0001). Among the remaining patients in
the GSE3494 cohort (n = 217, validation cohort) we
validated the capacity of the p53 gene signature to predict
TP53 status, and found that the p53 signature remained
significantly associated with tumor p53 status using both
t-tests and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis (Figures 5B–5C, t-test, *p < 0.0001, AUC: 0.74,
*p < 0.0001). Accordingly, these data suggest that our p53
signature can be used as a surrogate marker of tumor TP53
status, and represents a useful tool to examine TP53 status
in additional transcriptional breast tumor datasets.
We next measured the relationship between tumor
TP53 status and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Application of the p53 signature in the same 5 cohorts
of neadjuvant treated breast cancer patients revealed
a robust relationship between the p53 signature and
patient response (Figure 5D & Supplementary Figure 7,
Supplementary Table 8; 5 cohorts; total n = 1066; AUC
> 0.5). In 4 of 5 cohorts the AUC was significantly above
0.5, whereas the 5th cohort (GSE20271) narrowly missed
significance (p = 0.07). In all cases elevated p53 signature
scores, indicating mutant TP53 status, was associated with
chemotherapy sensitivity. Accordingly, we concluded
that mutant TP53 status, as assessed by our transcript
signature, was associated with chemotherapy sensitivity.

MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Figure 5C). Taken
together these findings suggest that down-regulation of
cell cycle gene expression is dependent on functional p53
signaling, ultimately leading to chemotherapy resistance.

Functional p53 signaling is associated with
chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer patients
Our data described above suggested that a reduction
of cell cycle gene expression following therapy is
associated with chemotherapy resistance and that this
is dependent, at least in part, by activation of functional
p53 signaling. Based on this data we hypothesized that
intact p53 signaling in human breast cancer patients
would likely be associated with chemotherapy resistance.
To confirm this hypothesis, we sought to test whether a
transcriptional signature of TP53 mutational status was
associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
similar to our observations made with the RS. We first
interrogated transcriptional data (GSE3494) of 251
breast tumors for which the mutational status of TP53
was also known [27]. In short, we used PAM and 10fold cross-validation to identify an 18 probe set signature
that was associated with p53 status in patient samples
(n = 34, training cohort) comprising a subset of the original
GSE3494 cohort (Supplementary Table 7). Expectedly,
we found that among training patients, those whose

Induction of G1 arrest by p53 results in
chemotherapy resistance

leading to mitotic catastrophe and nuclear fragmentation
[28]. We exposed cells to either Tax (100 nM) alone or
a combination of Nutlin3A (10 μM) and Tax, and then
compared the frequency of fragmented nuclei among cell
lines with WT TP53 (MCF7 & BT474) or mutant TP53
(MDA-MB-231 & T47D). Irrespective of the cell line,
exposure of breast tumor cells to Tax alone rapidly induced
nuclear fragmentation in ~70% of nuclei (Figures 6A–6B).
G1/G0 arrest of the cell lines harboring WT TP53 with
Nutlin3A during exposure to Tax rescued the lines
from Tax-induced nuclear fragmentation, (Figure 6A).
Importantly, Nutlin3A did not protect cell lines harboring
mutant TP53 from Tax-induced nuclear fragmentation
(Figures 6A–6B).

Our data suggested that activation of p53 signaling
by either chemotherapy induced DNA damage or small
molecules that prevent p53 degradation decreased cell
cycle gene expression resulting in G1/G0 arrest in a
subset of breast tumor cell lines harboring WT TP53
alleles. Moreover, analysis of clinical data suggested this
mechanism might drive therapy resistance whereby cells
avoid cell death during exposure to cytotoxic agents.
To test this hypothesis directly we first examined
cell nuclear morphology in response to Tax, a
chemotherapeutic agent that stabilizes microtubules thus

mutant TP53. These data show that activation of
functional p53 signaling and G1/G0 arrest protects
cells during exposure to the cytotoxic effects of Tax.

that had been exposed to Tax or Tax and Nutlin3A
to establish whether division-competent viable cells
remained after exposure to these agents. Cells were
either incubated with vehicle (control) or Nutlin3A for
3 days, with both receiving a 24 hour treatment of Tax
at the beginning of day 2. While vehicle controls grew
to confluency (data not shown), Tax-only treatment in
the presence of vehicle inhibited the capacity of both
WT TP53 and mutant TP53 cells to form colonies
(Figures 6C & 6D). However, the presence of Nutlin3A

underlie cancer patient response to chemotherapy will

Here we describe the novel observation that
chemotherapy induced cell cycle gene expression changes
is predictive of patient response. To date, most reports
relating patterns in tumor gene expression to clinical
responses have focused primarily on discovering genomic
features in pre-treatment biopsies that predict therapy
response [5–10]. However, we report that changes in gene
expression occurring during response to chemotherapy
are also related to patient response. We identified a set
of 10 genes associated with cellular proliferation, termed
Module 1, that are among the most variably expressed
genes within tumors following treatment. Module 1
genes are coordinately regulated intra-tumorally, and
are uniformly up or down-regulated in response to
chemotherapy. RS, a surrogate measure for changes in
Module 1 gene expression, was significantly related to
patient response in 5 cohorts of breast cancer patients
(total n = 1066), as well as in smaller cohorts of colon and
ovarian cancer patients (n = 37 and n = 58, respectively).
Specifically, tumors predicted to increase Module 1 gene
expression following chemotherapy were more likely
to respond favorably to treatment, whereas the opposite
was true for tumors predicted to reduce Module 1 gene
expression in response to chemotherapy.
From a clinical standpoint, pre-treatment evaluation
of the RS or monitoring cell cycle changes during the
course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, might represent
valuable predictive biomarkers. In this fashion, patients
identified as resistant to chemotherapy could benefit
from expedient enrollment in clinical trials investigating
the efficacy of novel agents [29]. However, many issues
remain to be addressed to confirm the clinical utility
of either the RS or monitoring Module 1 genes during
treatment. For example, our conclusions are based on the
analysis of retrospective data, which limits its clinical
value, and our analyses of colon and ovarian tumors were
limited by the small sample sizes available. Prospective
clinical trials would establish a full understanding of the
utility of the approach presented here.
To date, most predictive gene signatures identified
for breast cancer derive their predictive capacity based
on their ability to measure proliferation in pre-treatment
tumor samples [6, 9, 17]. The relationship between
proliferation and response is further supported by
reports that ki67 staining is also a robust predictor of
chemotherapy response [30–32]. In the initially discovery
dataset (GSE28844) we did not observe a significant
relationship between the RS and Ki67, although some
caution is warranted when interpreting this result as it is
only based on analysis of 26 samples. Nonetheless, these
data overall suggest that the RS may capture distinct
predictive information from either Ki67 staining or purely
proliferation based signatures.
The success of the RS to identify chemotherapy
responsive tumors led us to investigate the phenomenon
whereby therapy response occurs. To this end we used
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

breast tumor cell lines to discover that a subset of cell lines
examined entered G1/G0 cell cycle arrest after exposure
to Dx. Bioinformatic and in vitro experiments linked this
behavior with TP53 integrity: activation of p53 signaling
was sufficient to induce G1/G0 arrest, which in turn
protected cells from further chemotherapy treatments, thus
permitting subsequent tumor cell regrowth post-therapy.
Many clinical studies have examined the relationship
between TP53 status and drug response: some were
inconclusive [33, 34], whereas others linked chemotherapy
responsiveness/sensitivity with either WT TP53 [35–37]
or mutant TP53 [38–40]. Our study found that TP53
integrity is associated with chemotherapy outcome, and
that WT TP53 is most strongly connected with resistance
to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. Indeed, MMTVWnt1 mouse mammary tumors with mutant TP53 are
significantly more sensitive to Dx than those with WT
TP53 [41]. The composition of the RS is intriguing, as
it includes the gene WRAP53 (WDR79). WRAP53 is a
naturally occurring TP53 antisense transcript that has been
demonstrated to positively regulate p53 levels via RNA
interaction [42]. Based on the RS, WRAP53 expression
is higher in tumors that respond to chemotherapy through
reduced expression of cell cycle genes, consistent with its
role as a positive regulator of p53 and its association with
resistance.
Intriguingly, although TP53 mutations are known
to occur in a molecular subtype specific fashion among
breast cancer patients [43, 44], no study has examined
the relationship between TP53 status and chemotherapy
response in a subtype specific fashion. Taken with this
data, our results provide a possible explanation for the
differences in chemotherapeutic sensitivity observed
between breast tumors of differing molecular subtypes
[7, 45, 46]. For example, basal-like breast tumors harbor
the highest frequency of mutations in TP53 [43, 47] and
patients with basal-like tumors are known to experience
the highest rates of pathological response. Conversely,
luminal breast tumors harbor the lowest frequency of
mutations in TP53 and patients with luminal tumors
experience the lowest rates of pathological response.
It will be interestingly to learn if mutations in TP53 are
associated with chemotherapy sensitivity in other tumor
types. Indeed, a recent report suggests that mutations
in TP53 are associated with favorable responses to
chemotherapy in ovarian cancers [48].
One important aspect to consider when interpreting
the data we present here is the role of therapy-induced
senescence (TIS). TIS is a common tumor response to
cytotoxic chemotherapies, including Dx [49], which
results in permanent growth arrest, via halting the cell
cycle in G2/M or G1 phase [50]. TIS shares overlapping
characteristics with normal physiological senescence,
including several genetic pathways that have been
implicated in TIS, such as the tumour suppressors p53
and Rb. However it is important to note that WT TP53
7048

Oncotarget

and mutant TP53 cells [49], as well as cells completely
lacking TP53 [51, 52] can undergo TIS, indicating that
functional p53 signalling is not a required component for
attaining TIS.
The extent to which TIS defines a patient’s response
to chemotherapy is not fully understood, but it is clear that
TIS is not observed in all tumor cells, and that a small
fraction of cells can evade TIS and reinitiate growth
[52]. A key experiment presented here demonstrated that
activation of a functional p53 program in response to
nutlin3A was protective against the cytotoxic effects of
chemotherapy (Figures 6A–6D), a result that is consistent
with previous important studies linking p53 induction
and mitotic inhibitor protection [53–60]. Although
this observation is not necessarily consistent with p53
mediated induction of senescence, as treated cells
retained the capacity to proliferate and make colonies.
Hence, p53 driven resistance likely also includes a nonsenescent mechanism(s) of cell cycle arrest. However,
the transcriptional analyses presented here may generally
afford a new avenue for investigating TIS mechanisms of
patient response to chemotherapy.
Overall, the findings we present here have several
important implications. Clinically, they suggest that either
the RS signature or directly monitoring changes in cell
cycle gene expression during treatment could be used
for timely identification of non-responders, who could
then be rapidly switched to alternate therapeutic options.
Moreover, our findings also link TP53 integrity with
treatment-induced changes in tumor cell responsiveness
to chemotherapeutic drugs. Hence, modulation of p53
signaling with various small molecules depending
on pathway integrity could serve to increase potency
of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. Finally,
we extended our finding in ovarian and colon tumors,
suggesting that the implications of our work extend
beyond breast tumors and may apply to the majority of
tumors independent of tissue-of-origin.

H2GFOIP reporter were produced by electroporation
(300 v, 250 uF, 0.4 mm cuvette gap) with pCAG H2GFOIP
plasmid DNA [20] and selected by the addition of 1 ug/ml
puromycin to the medium. Other breast cancer reporter
lines that proved refractory to electroporation-mediated
transgenesis (BT-474, T47D, and MDA-MB-361) were
infected with a H2GFO lentivirus. The recombinant
H2GFO lentivirus was constructed as follows. The
H2BGFP-F2A-mKO2-Cdt1 fragment was released from
pCAG-H2GFOIP by digestion with KpnI and PmeI, and
then subcloned into KpnI/EcoRV cut pEF-1a/pENTR
(Addgene #17427) [61]. A LR clonase (Invitrogen)
recombination reaction was then used to deliver pEF-1a
H2BGFP-F2A-mKO2-Cdt1 into the pLenti X1 puro
DEST vector (Addgene #17297). Virus was prepared
as previously described, and stably infected cells were
selected by the addition of 1 ug/ml puromycin to the
medium.

Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry
Immunocytochemistry was performed in 96
well plates. Cells were fixed and stained as previously
described [62] with antibodies to p21 (rabbit polyclonal,
Cell Signaling # 2947; 1:400 dilution) or Ki67 (mouse
monoclonal, Santa Cruz # SC23900; 1:100 dilution) and
with appropriate secondary AF647 antibodies (Invitrogen
#A-21238 & #A-31571; 1:500 dilution). Nuclei were
co-stained with Hoechst 33342. BrdU incorporation
experiments were performed as per manufacturers
instructions (BD FITC BrdU Flow Kit #559619) and
acquired on a LSRII (BD). Analysis was performed using
FlowJo software.

Live cell imaging and high content imaging
Details for live and high content imaging are
described previously [20, 62]. Briefly, for live cell
imaging, cell lines were seeded in 12 well plates at
50,000 cells per well, and imaged using a Biostation CT
live imaging system (Nikon). Dx or Nutlin3A was added
immediately prior to imaging, and images were acquired
every 15 minutes for 3–4 days, compiled in ImageJ and
then analysed with custom ImageJ scripts. Cell tracking
was performed manually in ImageJ using the MtrackJ
plugin or semi-automated with custom software written
in Matlab 2012a (MathWorks, Natick, MA). A crosscorrelation algorithm for automated cell tracking was
implemented on a graphics workstation (Intel Xeon
E5–1607, 16 GB RAM, equipped with a Tesla C2075
GPU). The Matlab cell tracking platform generates division
pedigree databases. The latter were interrogated to yield
individual cell features such as FUCCI-G1 fluorescence,
G1 and S-phase duration and annotated fates (division,
apoptosis, endoreplication, lost, or end of experiment).
The database platform includes tools for display of single

All cell lines were obtained from the ATCC,
characterized by STR profiling, and passaged minimally
prior to completing these experiments. MCF7, BT-474,
MB-MDA-231, T47D, HCC-1954, ZR-75-1, MDAMB-175VIII, BT549, and MDA-MB-361 BC cell lines

expression dynamics as bar graphs or division trees. For
high content imaging, cells were seeded at 10,000 cells
per well of 96 well plates and imaged using an Operetta
High Content Imaging system (Perkin Elmer). High
content imaging data was transferred to a Columbus
(Perkin Elmer) database and ~1,000–2,000 cells per n were
analyzed with custom scripts in Acapella (Perkin Elmer)
that segmented nuclear objects by Hoechst or H2BGFP,
and subsequent intensity quantification for FUCCI-G1 or
AF647 signals were performed. Fragmentation analysis
was performed using Acapella-based phenoLOGIC
machine learning after supervised identification of normal
and TAX-induced fragmented nuclei.

The predictive capacity of the RS signature was
evaluated using receiver-operator characteristic curve
(ROC) analysis, as well as univariate and multivariate
logistic regression. T-tests were also used to compare RS
signature scores between responsive and non-responsive
tumors. All tests were two-sided and a p-value of 0.05
or less was considered statistically significant. All graphs
for in vitro experiments show standard deviation derived
from n = 3–5.
