Abstract

Author Manuscript

Genetic variation in CHRNA5, the gene encoding the α5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)
subunit, increases vulnerability to tobacco addiction and lung cancer, but underlying mechanisms
are unknown. Here, we report dramatically increased nicotine consumption in mice with null
mutation in Chrna5. This effect was `rescued' in knockout mice by re-expressing α5 subunits in
medial habenula (MHb), and recapitulated in rats through α5 subunit knockdown in MHb.
Remarkably, α5 subunit knockdown in MHb did not alter the rewarding effects of nicotine but
abolished the inhibitory effects of higher nicotine doses on brain reward systems. The MHb
extends projections almost exclusively to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). We found diminished
IPN activation in response to nicotine in α5 knockout mice and disruption of IPN signaling
increased nicotine intake in rats. Our findings suggest that nicotine activates the habenulointerpeduncular pathway through α5-containing nAChRs, triggering an inhibitory motivational
signal that acts to limit nicotine intake.

Tobacco smoking results in greater than 5 million deaths each year and accounts for almost
90% of all deaths from lung cancer1. Nicotine is the principal reinforcing component in
tobacco smoke responsible for addiction2. Nicotine acts in the brain through the neuronal
nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are ligand-gated ion channels consisting
of five membrane-spanning subunits3. Twelve neuronal nAChR subunits have been
identified, nine α subunits (α2–α10) and three β subunits (β2–β4)3. The predominant
nAChR subtypes in mammalian brain that have been heavily implicated in regulating the
addictive properties of nicotine are those containing α4 and β2 subunits (denoted α4β2*
nAChRs)4,5,6,7,8. A major advance in our understanding of smoking behavior is the finding
that allelic variation in the α5/α3/β4 nAChR subunit gene cluster located in chromosome

region 15q25 significantly increases risk of tobacco addiction9,10,11. In particular,
polymorphisms in the α5 subunit gene (CHRNA5), which result in decreased function of the
subunit, increase vulnerability to tobacco addiction12,13. Nevertheless, mechanisms through
which α5* nAChRs may influence smoking behavior are unclear. Genetic variability in
CHRNA5 is also a major risk factor for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) in smokers14,15,16, which may reflect higher levels of tobacco dependence
in individuals carrying risk alleles and consequently greater exposure to carcinogens
contained in tobacco smoke17, although the precise role of α5* nAChRs in lung cancer and
COPD is unknown.

α5* nAChRs control nicotine intake

Here, we investigated the role of α5* nAChRs in the reinforcing properties of nicotine. We
found that wildtype and knockout mice responded for intravenously self-administered
nicotine infusions according to an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve, consistent with
previous reports in humans18, non-human primates19, dogs20 and rats21. However, the
knockout mice responded far more vigorously than wildtype mice for nicotine infusions,
especially when higher unit doses were available (Fig. 1a); see Ref.22. Increased responding
for nicotine in knockout mice was not secondary to alterations in operant performance or the
motivational salience of reward-paired conditioned stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 1). When
we calculated total amounts of nicotine consumed at each dose available for selfadministration, we found that wildtype mice titrated their responding to consume ~1.5 mg
kg−1 per session (Fig. 1b); which achieves plasma concentrations of nicotine comparable to
those detected in humans after 5 h of smoking their preferred brand of cigarette23,24. In
contrast, knockout mice did not titrate their responding and consumed greater amounts of
nicotine as the dose increased (Fig. 1b). Knockout mice also had greater motivation to seek
and obtain nicotine when tested under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, an
effect most apparent again at high doses (Supplementary Fig. 2). Enhanced responding for
nicotine as the unit dose increases is thought to reflect an intensification of the reinforcing
properties of the drug, thereby motivating higher levels of intake25. Diminished responding
as the dose increases reflects greater restraint over intake to avoid the increasingly aversive
effects of higher drug doses18,25 or more rapid development of drug satiation25,26. Our
findings therefore suggest that deletion of α5 nAChR subunits has a dissociable effect on the
motivational drives that control nicotine intake. The stimulatory effects of nicotine on brain
reinforcement systems (i.e., ascending portion of dose-response curve) are unaltered by α5
subunit knockout, since the wildtype and knockout mice responded for nicotine at a similar
maximal rate. Instead, deficient α5* nAChR signaling appears to attenuate the negative
effects of nicotine that limit its intake (i.e., descending portion of dose-response curve).
These findings are highly consistent with the increased vulnerability to tobacco addiction in
human smokers carrying CHRNA5 risk alleles that result in less functional α5*
nAChRs12,13.

Habenular α5* nAChRs control nicotine intake
The α5 nAChR subunit has a restricted distribution profile in the brain, with dense
expression in the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway, deep layers of the cortex and

hippocampus, and lower expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia
nigra27. The medial habenula (MHb) projects almost exclusively to the interpeduncular
nucleus (IPN) via the fasciculus retroflexus28. Functional α5* nAChRs are expressed on
MHb afferents to the IPN29, and high but not low nicotine doses activate the habenulointerpeduncular tract, as measured by an increased local glucose utilization in rats30. The
habenulo-interpeduncular tract regulates avoidance of noxious substances31 and regulates
somatic aspects of nicotine withdrawal32. However, little is known of its role in drug-taking
behavior33. Intriguingly, the lateral habenula (LHb) has an inhibitory influence on VTA
dopamine neurons34, is activated by aversive stimuli or omission of anticipated reward, and
is considered a source of negative motivational signals in the brain34. We therefore
hypothesized that nicotine-induced stimulation of α5* nAChRs in the habenulointerpeduncular pathway triggers an inhibitory motivational signal that limits consumption
of the drug. In knockout and wildtype mice that received injections of a control lentivirus
expressing green-fluorescent protein (GFP; Lenti-Control) into the MHb, we again found
that knockout mice self-administered far greater amounts of nicotine when a high unit dose
was available (Fig. 2a), replicating the above findings. However, nicotine intake was
indistinguishable in knockout versus wildtype mice after injection of a lentivirus vector
(Lenti-CHRNA5) into the MHb to rescue α5 nAChR subunits in the habenulointerpeduncular tract (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 3). GFP immunostaining to confirm MHb
delivery of virus was carried out for the majority of the mice. Responding for nicotine (0,
0.1 and 0.4 mg kg−1 per infusion) in the subset of Lenti-CHRNA5-treated used for
immunostaining 3.6 ± 0.83, 8.8 ± 1.4 and 4.86 ± 1.0, respectively, for wildtypes and 4.53 ±
0.85, 7.72 ± 0.68 and 4.53 ± 1.4, respectively, for knockouts. GFP immunostaining
confirmed that virus-infected cells were detected almost exclusively in the habenulointerpeduncular tract of Lenti-CHRNA5 knockout mice, with little detectable staining in
other brain areas that could potentially impact self-administration behavior (Fig. 2c,d;
Supplementary Fig. 4). The remaining mice not used for immunostaining were used to
verify that the Lenti-CHRNA5 virus was function. Real-time PCR verified that α5 subunit
mRNA was detectable only in habenula (Supplementary Fig. 5) and IPN (Supplementary
Fig. 6) of the Lenti-CHRNA5-treated knockout mice, suggesting that α5 nAChR subunit
mRNA is transported from the MHb along the fasciculus retroflexus and into the IPN.
Wildtype mice treated with the Lenti-CHRNA5 vector did not demonstrate increased α5
subunit mRNA above baseline levels in the habenula (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting
that strict regulatory mechanisms control α5* nAChR expression in the MHb-IPN pathway.

Using radiolabeled rubidium (86Rb+) efflux as a functional measure of nAChR signaling,
we found that acetylcholine-evoked 86Rb+ efflux was dramatically attenuated in
synaptosomes prepared from the habenula and IPN, but not the cortex or hippocampus, of a
separate cohort of knockout versus wildtype mice (Supplementary Fig. 7). Consistent with a
recent report, 86Rb+ efflux was also attenuated in synaptosomes from the thalamus of
knockout mice35 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Injections of lenti-CHRNA5 into MHb attenuated
the deficits in 86Rb+ efflux in IPN, but not in MHb or thalamus, of knockout mice
(Supplementary Fig. 8). These findings demonstrate that α5* nAChRs play a critical role in
regulating nAChR transmission in the habenulo-interpeduncular tract, and confirm that the
Lenti-CHRNA5 vector rescues not only expression, but also function, of α5* nAChRs in the

habenulo-interpeduncular pathway. These data also reveal three additional insights: First, α5
subunits produced in MHb are predominately incorporated into α5* nAChRs expressed
presynaptically on afferents to IPN. Second, injections of the Lenti-CHRNA5 vector into
MHb rescued local α5 subunit mRNA expression, but not deficits in MHb 86Rb+ efflux.
This suggests that nAChR signaling in MHb may be derived from α5* nAChRs located
presynaptically on afferent inputs from brain sites not infected by the virus. Third, whilst the
Lenti-CHRNA5 vector attenuated the deficits in nAChR signaling detected in IPN of
knockout mice, this rescue was only partial (Fig. 2e). Hence, postsynaptically localized α5*
nAChRs on IPN neurons, or perhaps presynaptic α5* nAChRs on afferent inputs that
originate from brain sites other than the MHb, also play a major role in nAChR transmission
in the IPN.

Next, we developed and validated a lentivirus vector to deliver a short-hairpin interfering
RNA against the α5 nAChR subunit (Lenti-α5-shRNA; Supplementary Fig. 9). We then
microinjected the Lenti-α5-shRNA vector into the MHb of rats to knockdown habenulointerpeduncular α5* nAChRs (Supplementary Fig. 10). As expected, Lenti-Control rats
responded for nicotine according to an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve (Fig. 3a).
There was a dramatic increase in nicotine consumption across the dose-response curve in the
Lenti-α-shRNA rats that was most apparent at high unit doses (Fig. 3a). When total nicotine
intake at each dose was calculated, we found that Lenti-Control rats titrated their responding
to consume ~0.75–1 mg kg−1 nicotine per session (Supplementary Fig. 10). In contrast,
knockdown rats showed little evidence of titration and continued to increase their
consumption as the unit dose increased. We obtained similar effects on nicotine intake using
a second lentivirus vector that expressed an shRNA targeting a different portion of α5
subunit mRNA (Supplementary Fig. 11). Overall, these findings in rats recapitulate those in
the α5 knockout mice and confirm that α5* nAChRs in the habenulo-interpeduncular
pathway regulate levels of nicotine intake across species.

α5* nAChRs inhibit brain reward function

Author Manuscript

Next, we examined the effects of nicotine on brain-stimulation reward (BSR) thresholds in
rats following knockdown of α5* nAChRs in the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway. In the
BSR procedure, rats respond vigorously to obtain rewarding electrical self-stimulation via
an intracranial stimulating electrode, with the minimal stimulation intensity that maintains
self-stimulation behavior termed the reward threshold. Low doses of nicotine (~0.25 mg
kg−1) that condition a place preference in rats also lower BSR thresholds36, reflecting druginduced enhancement of brain reward activity. Conversely, higher doses of nicotine (≥1 mg
kg−1) that condition a place aversion can elevate BSR thresholds in rats37. Importantly, rats
regulate their pattern of nicotine self-administration behavior at a level that achieves
maximal lowering of BSR thresholds36, suggesting that obtaining the stimulatory effects of
nicotine on brain reward circuits, whilst avoiding its negative effects, determines the
amounts of nicotine consumed by rats. We found that low doses of nicotine (0.125–0.25 mg
kg−1; free-base; SC) lowered BSR thresholds by a similar magnitude in the Lenti-Control
and Lenti-α5-shRNA rats (Fig. 3b). However, as the dose of nicotine was increased (1–1.5
mg kg−1; free-base; SC), BSR thresholds were elevated above baseline in Lenti-Control rats,
but continued to be lowered below baseline levels in Lenti-α5-shRNA rats (Fig. 3b). These

data demonstrate that the stimulatory effects of nicotine on brain reward systems, which
likely provide a crucial source of reinforcement that maintains the tobacco smoking habit38,
are unaltered by deficits in α5* nAChRs in the MHb-IPN pathway. Instead, the inhibitory
effects of higher nicotine doses on the activity of reward circuitries, which likely determine
the amounts of nicotine that can be consumed, are greatly attenuated by knockdown of α5*
nAChRs in this pathway.

Habenular α5* nAChRs regulate IPN activation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The 86Rb+ efflux data above suggest that α5 subunits transcribed in the MHb are
incorporated into presynaptic α5* nAChRs in the IPN where they may regulate
neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine and glutamate are the major neurotransmitters
produced by MHb neurons innervating the IPN39, and presynaptic α5* nAChRs are thought
to regulate glutamate but not acetylcholine release in IPN29,40,41 Interestingly,
glutamatergic transmission at the MHb-IPN synapse is increased in response to nicotine
concentrations likely achieved in the brains of smokers42. We therefore hypothesized that
deficient α5* nAChR signaling in the habenulo-interpeduncular tract may decrease nicotineevoked glutamatergic transmission in the IPN and thereby attenuate a negative motivational
signal that limits its intake. Consistent with this hypothesis, an aversive higher dose of
nicotine (1.5 mg kg−1)43, but not a rewarding lower dose (0.5 mg kg−1)43, robustly
activated the IPN in wildtype mice, reflected in increased Fos immunoreactivity (Fig. 4a,b).
This effect of the high nicotine dose was almost completely abolished in the knockout mice.
Wildtype and α5 knockout mice displayed similar Fos immunoreactivity in the ventromedial
hypothalamus (Supplementary Fig. 12), a region in which Fos induction is highly stress
responsive44, suggesting that altered stress responses in knockout mice did not account for
this effect. Nicotine-induced increases in Fos immunoreactivity in the VTA, which controls
the reinforcing effects of nicotine, were similar in wildtype and α5 knockout mice
(Supplementary Fig. 13). Nevertheless, there was a non-statistically significant trend toward
lower VTA Fos immunoreactivity in the knockout mice in response to the high nicotine
dose. Considering that the VTA can also regulate aversive responses to nicotine45, it is
possible that α5* nAChRs in VTA may differentially regulate activation of this structure in
response to aversive but not rewarding doses of nicotine. Taken together, these findings are
consistent with our behavioral data in which the reinforcing effects of nicotine, likely
involving VTA activation, are substantially conserved in the knockout mice. However,
recruitment of an aversive/satiety pathway by nicotine overconsumption, likely involving
habenular-driven activation of IPN, is diminished in animals with deficient α5* nAChR
signaling.

Habenular-IPN activity limits nicotine intake
We next examined the effects of reversible inactivation of the habenulo-interpeduncular
tract on nicotine self-administration behavior in rats, accomplished by direct microinjection
of lidocaine into targeted brain sites. Lidocaine-induced inactivation of the IPN increased
responding for nicotine (0.03 mg kg−1 per infusion) (Fig. 5a; Supplementary Fig. 14),
further supporting a role for nicotine-induced activation of the IPN in restricting nicotine
intake. Conversely, inactivation of the VTA profoundly decreased nicotine intake (0.03 mg

kg−1 per infusion) (Supplementary Fig. 15, 16). Inactivation of the MHb increased nicotine
intake similar to IPN inactivation (Fig. 5b), but this effect was only detected when rats selfadministered a higher (0.12 mg kg−1 per infusion) unit dose of nicotine (Supplementary
Figs. 17, 18). This effect is consistent with habenular-mediated activation of the IPN
preferentially occurring when higher nicotine doses are consumed. Next, we investigated the
role of glutamate-mediated transmission in these brain sites in regulating nicotine intake.
Microinjection of the competitive N-methy-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor
antagonist LY23595946 into the IPN dose-dependently increased nicotine selfadministration (Fig. 5c). LY235959 infused into MHb also increased nicotine intake at the
higher unit dose of nicotine, whereas infusion into VTA decreased nicotine intake (Fig, 5d;
Supplementary Fig. 16). Taken together, these data support a conceptual framework in
which high levels of nicotine intake stimulate the habenulo-interpeduncular tract through
α5* nAChRs and thereby enhance NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic transmission in
the IPN. This nicotine-induced enhancement of IPN activity relays an inhibitory
motivational signal that limits further drug intake. Deficient α5* nAChR signaling
diminishes the magnitude of this inhibitory motivational signal, permitting larger amounts of
nicotine to be consumed (Supplementary Fig. 19).

Our findings reveal the habenulo-interpeduncular pathway as a key neurocircuit controlling
nicotine intake. This circuit acts in a manner opposite to the mesoaccumbens `positive
reward' pathway and instead transmits an inhibitory motivational signal that limits nicotine
intake. There are reciprocal projections between the MHb and portions of the caudomedial
VTA (interfascicular nucleus), with the VTA and IPN projecting to many common brain
areas including the dorsal tegmental nucleus, raphé nuclei and dorsomedial nucleus of
thalamus. Hence, it will be important to determine if direct cross-talk between VTA and
IPN, or integration of reward-related information from these structures at downstream brain
sites47, is responsible for regulating the motivational salience of nicotine and coordinating
behavioral output. Our data suggest that individuals carrying risk alleles for tobacco
dependence resulting in deficient α5* nAChR function are relatively insensitive to
inhibitory effects of nicotine on reward pathways, consequently extending the range of
nicotine doses that have net stimulatory effects on reward systems. Such a scenario is likely
to be most important in the acquisition of the tobacco habit in which experiencing a negative
effect of nicotine on reward pathways may decrease the likelihood of repeatedly engaging in
smoking behavior64. As such, these findings have important implications for understanding
the high incidence of lung cancer and COPD in individuals carrying CHRNA5 risk alleles,
suggesting that far higher levels of nicotine can be tolerated in these individuals, likely
resulting in greater exposure to carcinogens contained in tobacco smoke. In summary, we
have established a new framework for understanding the motivational drives that control
nicotine intake. These findings are a key advance in our understanding of brain systems that
regulate vulnerability to tobacco addiction, and reveal the importance of a5* nAChRs as
targets for the development of novel smoking cessation therapeutics.

silastic catheters in the jugular vein and trained to respond on an “active” lever for food
pellets under a fixed ratio 5 time-out 20 sec (FR5TO20) schedule of reinforcement. Mice
and rats then responded for nicotine infusions on the FR5TO20 sec reinforcement schedule
during 1 h daily testing sessions. Nicotine hydrogen tartrate salt was dissolved in sterile
saline solution (0.9% w/v). Each nicotine reward earned resulted in the delivery of a nicotine
infusion (0.033 ml injection volume delivered over 3-sec in mice; 0.1 ml delivered over 1sec in rats) and initiated a 20-sec time-out period signaled by a light cue located above the
active lever during which responding on the lever was without consequence.

and baseline behavioral measures between the knockout mice and wildtype littermates1. The
mutant mice have been bred for more than 10 generations onto a C57BL6 background.
Breeding was conducted by mating heterozygous pairs. All mice were housed in cages of 1–
3 and were at least 6 weeks of age at the beginning of each experiment. Male Wistar rats
weighing 275–300g were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and housed 1–2 per
cage. Mice and rats were maintained in an environmentally controlled vivarium on a 12h:
12h reversed light:dark cycle, and food and water were provided ad libitum until behavioral
training commenced. During self-administration procedures, mice and rats were food
restricted to 85–90% of their free-feeding body weight, but water was maintained without
restriction. All procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the NIH Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of The Scripps Research Institute - Florida.

Genotyping
Around 21 days of age, mouse pups were weaned and their tails were clipped for genetic
analysis. DNA was extracted with a tissue DNA extraction kit purchased from Biomiga, Inc.
(San Diego, CA). Primers for the α5 wildtype and mutant genes were: α5 wildtype forward

amplification with PCR and subsequently run on a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide.
The band for the α5 wildtype gene was at 190bp, and the α5 mutant gene was at 290bp.

Surgery

Author Manuscript

Mice and rats were anesthetized with an isoflurane (1–3%)/oxygen vapor mixture and
prepared with intravenous catheters. Briefly, the catheters consisted of a 6 cm (mice) or 12
cm (rats) length of silastic tubing fitted to guide cannula (Plastics One, Wallingford, CT)
bent at a curved right angle and encased in dental acrylic. The catheter tubing was passed
subcutaneously from the animal's back to the right jugular vein, and a 1 cm (mice) or 2.5 cm
(rats) length of the catheter tip was inserted into the vein and tied with surgical silk suture.
Catheters were flushed daily with physiological sterile saline solution (0.9% w/v) containing
heparin (10–60 USP units/ml). Catheter integrity was tested with the ultra short-acting
barbiturate anesthetic Brevital® (methohexital sodium, Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN).
Intravenous self-administration

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Mice and rats were mildly food restricted to 85–90% of their free-feeding body weight and
trained to press a lever in an operant chamber (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) for food
pellets (20 mg pellets mice; 45 mg food pellets rats; TestDiet, Richmond, IN) under a fixedratio 5, time out 20 sec (FR5TO20 sec) schedule of reinforcement prior to catheter
implantation. Once stable responding was achieved (>30 pellets per session in mice; >90
pellets per session in rats), subjects were catheterized as described above. The animals were
allowed at least 48 h to recover from surgery, then permitted to respond for food
reinforcement again under the FR5TO20 sec schedule. Once food responding criteria was
reestablished, subjects were permitted to acquire intravenous nicotine self-administration by
autoshaping during 1 h daily sessions, 7 days per week. Nicotine was delivered through the
tubing into the intravenous catheter by a Razel syringe pump (Med Associates). Each
nicotine self-administration session was performed using 2 retractable levers (1 active, 1
inactive) that extend 1 cm into the chamber. Completion of the response criteria on the
active lever resulted in the delivery of an intravenous nicotine infusion (0.03 ml infusion
volume for mice; 0.1 ml for rats). Responses on the inactive lever were recorded but had no
scheduled consequences. For dose-response studies (fixed and progressive ratio schedules),
animals were presented with each dose of nicotine for at least 5 days (mice) or 3 days (rats);
the mean intake over the last 3 (mice) or 2 (rats) sessions for each dose was calculated and
used for statistical analysis. Nicotine doses were presented according to a within-subjects
Latin square design. In between each dose, subjects were placed back on the training dose
for at least 2 days or until their intake returned to baseline levels before being tested on the
next dose in the Latin-square design.
Surgical procedures for microinjections and ICSS electrode placement

Animals were anesthetized as above and positioned in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf
Instruments, Tujunga, CA). Unless otherwise noted, the incisor bar was set to the `flat-skull'
position. To test the efficacy of the re-expressing and knockdown viruses in vivo, bilateral
injections were made into the hippocampus of mice or rats, respectively. This area was
chosen based on the constitutive expression of α5 nAChR subunit mRNA in wildtype
animals. In mice, six bilateral injections (1 μl each at a flow rate of 1 μl per min) were made
at the following coordinates: anterior-posterior (AP): −1.7 mm from bregma; medial-lateral
(ML): ±0.75 mm from midline; dorsal-ventral (DV): −2.05 mm, −1.80 mm and −1.3 5mm

from brain surface2. In rats, the six hippocampal injections (three 2 μl injections per side at a
flow rate of 1 μl per min) were made at the following coordinates: AP: −3.3 mm from
bregma; ML: ±1.1 mm from midline; DV: −3.6 mm, −3.0 mm and −2.4 mm from brain
surface3. For habenular injections in mice, the needle was angled 20° toward midline, and
bilateral injections (0.375 μl each) were administered at a rate of 0.375 μl per min. For
habenular injections in rats, the lentivirus was injected bilaterally based on previously
published coordinates4. The incisor bar was set to 5 mm above plane, and the injector needle
was at a 10° angle toward midline (AP: −2.2 mm from bregma; ML: ±1.5 mm from midline;
DV: −4.9 mm from brain surface). The bilateral injections (1 μl each) were administered at a
rate of 1 μl per min. For all of the injections, the injector needle was remained in place for a
minimum of 2 min post-injection. For IPN and VTA microinjections in rats, guide cannula
(Plastics One) were implanted as follows: IPN (flat skull; 10° angle toward midline; AP:
−6.72 mm from bregma; ML: ±1.6 mm from midline; DV: −6.5 mm from brain surface) or
VTA (bilateral; flat skull; 6° angle toward midline; AP: −5.4 mm from bregma; ML: ±1.3
mm from midline; DV: −7.0 mm from skull)3. The MHb guide cannula coordinates were the
same as for the lentiviral injections, except with DV at −2.9 mm from brain surface. For all
of the cannula, injector needles extended 2 mm below the tip of the cannula for placement
into the brain region. For the ICSS electrode, a stainless steel bipolar electrode (Plastics
One) was implanted into the lateral hypothalamus (AP: −0.5 mm from bregma; ML: ±1.7
mm from midline; DV: −8.3 mm from brain surface)3.
BSR Behavioral Procedure

Author Manuscript

Rats were trained to respond according to a modification of the discrete-trial currentthreshold BSR procedure of Kornetsky and Esposito5,6 in an operant box equipped with a
wheel manipulandum and ICSS stimulator (Med Associates). Briefly, a trial was initiated by
the delivery of a non-contingent electrical stimulus. This electrical reinforcer had a duration
of 500 ms and consist of 0.1 ms rectangular cathodal pulses that delivered at a frequency of
50–100 Hz. The frequency of the stimulation was selected for individual rats so that
threshold elevation and lowering may be detected, and this frequency was held constant
throughout the experiment. A one-quarter turn of the wheel manipulandum within 7.5 sec of
the delivery of the non-contingent stimulation resulted in the delivery of an electrical
stimulus identical in all parameters to the non-contingent stimulus that initiated the trial.
After a variable inter-trial interval (7.5–12.5 sec, mean of 10 sec), another trial was initiated
with the delivery of a non-contingent electrical stimulus. Failure to respond to the noncontingent stimulus within 7.5 sec resulted in the onset of the inter-trial interval. Responding
during the inter-trial interval delayed the onset of the next trial by 12.5 sec. In each testing
session, current levels were varied in alternating descending (x2) and ascending (x2) series
in 5 μA steps. A set of five trials was presented for each current intensity. The threshold for
each series is defined as the midpoint between two consecutive current intensities that yield
“positive scores” (animals respond for at least three of the five trials) and two consecutive
current intensities that yield “negative scores” (animals do not respond for three or more of
the five trials). The overall threshold for the session is defined as the mean of the thresholds
for the four individual series. Threshold data are presented as percent of baseline values due
to inter-subject variability in baseline rates.

Generation of lentivirus

Author Manuscript

For α5 subunit re-expression studies, the mouse α5 nAChR subunit gene,Chrna5, was
cloned into the pCDF1 lentivirus expression vector containing cop-GFP from Systems
Biosciences, Inc. (Mountain View, CA). For α5 subunit knockdown studies, two different
short hairpin interfering RNAs (shRNA) directed against the rat Chrna5 gene were were
designed using the Genscript, Inc. online construct builder (see Supplementary Figs for
shRNA sequence). The shRNAs were cloned into the pRNAT-U6.2/Lenti construct
containing GFP (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). Control vectors were identical to the
expression constructs, but without the gene insert.
Generation of lentivirus

Author Manuscript

To generate lentivirus supernatant, HEK-293FT packaging cells (3.75 × 106 293TN cells per
10 cm plate) were transfected with the vectors, along with the pPACKF1TM Lentiviral
Packaging Kit using lipofectamine reagent and plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Medium containing virus particles (~10 ml) was harvested 48–
60 h post-transfection by centrifugation at 76,755g at room temperature for 5 min to pellet
cell debris and filtered through 0.45 mm PVDF filters (Millex-HV). To concentrate the viral
supernatant for intrastriatal administration, supernatants were centrifuged at 32,000g for 90
min at 4 °C, and the precipitate re-suspended in 100 μl cold PBS. Supernatants were
aliquoted into 10 ml volumes and stored at −80 °C until use.
Estimation of lentivirus titer

Author Manuscript

Viral supernatant titres were determined using the Lentivector Rapid Titer Kit from System
Biosciences, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The number of infectious units per
ml of supernatant (IFU ml−1) was calculated as follows: Multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
the sample × the number of cells in the well upon infection × 1,000 / μl of viral supernatant
used.
Tissue dissection
Mice and rats were euthanized by inhalation of CO2, brains were rapidly removed, and
frozen on dry ice. Tissues were stored at −80°C until dissection. Brains were sliced on a
cryostat, and bilateral dissections were made for the hippocampus, habenula, IPN and/or
VTA with a scalpel. Samples were pooled across multiple subjects due to the small size of
selected brain areas and stored in at −80°C until processing for RNA isolation.
RNA Isolation and real-time RT-PCR

Author Manuscript

Cells grown in monolayer or dissected tissue was homogenized in RNA-STAT60 (Tel-Test
Inc., Friendswood, TX) using a 27 gauge needle. Following homogenization, 250 μl of
chloroform was added and the samples were vortexed for 1 min. Samples were then
centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g at 4°C, and the upper aqueous RNA containing layer
was removed for an additional RNASTAT60/chloroform extraction. The RNA was
precipitated with 2 × volume of isopropanol overnight at −20°C and centrifuged for 30 min
at 12000 × g. The RNA pellets were washed twice with 70% ethanol/RNAase-free water and
subsequently resuspended in RNAsecure (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX), and

~10 μg of RNA from each sample was treated with Turbo DNase (Ambion/Applied
Biosystems) for 60 min at 37°C to degrade residual genomic DNA. To assess RNA levels,
samples were reverse transcribed into cDNA with the TaqMan High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Thereafter, they were
processed with the TaqMan Universal PCR kit with the mouse or rat CHRNA5 gene
expression assay (Applied Biosystems); controls consisted of either β-actin or 18S. Samples
were quantified by real-time RT-PCR (7900 Real-Time PCR system; Applied Biosystems).
All data were normalized in accordance with the mean housekeeping mRNA expressing
levels as an internal control. Comparison between groups made using the method of 2−ΔΔCt.
Brain Perfusion and Fixation

Author Manuscript

Subjects were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (0.1 mg/10 g body weight) and
perfused through the ascending aorta with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS; pH 7.4). Brains were harvested, postfixed for 2 hrs in
4% paraformaldehyde, and then stored in 30% sucrose in PBS. All brains were cut into 30–
40 μm coronal sections on a microtome, and the floating sections were stored in 0.1 M PBS
with 0.01% sodium azide at 4°C until processing for immunocytochemistry.
Fluorescence Immunolabeling

Author Manuscript

Floating sections were processed for GFP fluorescent immunostaining. To localize the GFPtagged lentivirus-infected cells in mice, we utilized a rabbit polyclonal IgG that recognizes
GFP cloned from copepod Pontellina plumata (copGFP). To localize the lentivirus tagged
with GFP in rats, we utilized a chicken polyclonal IgG that recognizes a 27kDa protein
derived from the jellyfish Aequorea Victoria. Further, to identify IPN we utilized a guinea
pig polyclonal IgG that recognizes VAChT. Sections were rinsed in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4, with
0.3% Triton-X 100 (PBT) and then blocked in 10% normal donkey serum/PBT. Thereafter,
sections were incubated in the primary antibody in PBT at 4°C overnight. The primary
antibodies were diluted as follows: rabbit anti-copGFP (1:2,000; Evrogen, Moscow, Russia),
chicken anti-GFP (1:2,000; Millipore, Billercia, MA) or guinea pig anti-VACHT (1:500;
Millipore). On day 2, the sections were rinsed and incubated in Alexa 488 donkey antirabbit (1:400; Invitrogen), DyLight 488 donkey anti-chicken (1:400; Jackson
ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and/or DyLight 594 or 647 donkey anti-guinea pig
(1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch) secondary antibodies in 0.3% PBT for 2 hrs. Next, the
sections were rinsed, mounted on slides with vectashield (with or without DAPI) (Vector
Labs, Burlingame, CA), and coverslipped. Controls included processing the secondary
antibodies alone to verify background staining, processing each primary with the secondary
antibody to verify laser-specific excitation, examining for autofluorescence in an alternate
laser channel with tissue lacking that laser-specific probe, and using sequential scanning.
For subsequent fluorescent images, only the brightness and/or contrast levels were adjusted
post-acquisition and were imposed across the entire image.

knockout mice were injected with either the Lenti-CHRNA5 or Lenti-Control vector as
previously described. Following an incubation period of at least 3 weeks, mice were killed
synaptosomes generated from the IPN, habenula, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus and
cortex as described previously 7. Samples were loaded with 86Rb+ and acetylcholinestimulated 86Rb+ efflux was measured as described previously7, with each sample
stimulated only once. 86Rb+ efflux was expressed as the increase in signal above basal
efflux. A non-linear least squares curve fit to a first order equation (Ct = C0*e−kt), where Ct
is the basal efflux counts at time, t, C0 is the estimated efflux counts at t = 0 sec, and k is the
first order decay constant) was used to estimate basal efflux for each sample. Counts in
fractions preceding and following the peak were used for curve fitting. Acetylcholinestimulated efflux was calculated by summing the counts in the fractions exceeding basal
efflux during ACh exposure and dividing by the corresponding basal efflux counts. This
value represents total peak relative to baseline.

Fos Procedure

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Wildtype and α5 subunit knockout mice were injected subcutaneously with nicotine (0.5 or
1.5 mg/kg, free-base) or saline. The moderate dose of nicotine is known to be rewarding in
these mice, reflected in the conditioning of a place preference8. The higher dose of nicotine
is aversive, reflected in the induction of a conditioned taste aversion in wildtype mice9.
After 2 hr, each subject was perfused and brains were removed and stored as described
above. Brain sections were cut at 30μm on a cryostat and stored in 0.1M PBS with 0.01%
sodium azide until processing. For Fos immunolabeling, sections were rinsed in 0.1M PBS
(ph 7.4), treated with 0.3% H2O2-PBS for 15 min, rinsed in PBS, and then blocked in 10%
normal goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hr. Thereafter, sections were
incubated in rabbit anti-cfos IgG (1:500 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) in 0.5% TritonPBS overnight at 4°C. The following day, sections were incubated at room temperature for 2
hrs, rinsed in PBS, and then incubated in 1:300 dilution of goat anti-rabbit secondary IgG
(Vector Labs) in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 hrs. Following rinsing, sections were
incubated in ABC Elite (Vector Labs) for 90 min, rinsed in PBS, and immunoreactivity was
revealed by using 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) with nickel (Vector Labs). To reduce
variability in the background and to standardize the staining, sections from subjects across
groups were processed concurrently. Sections were mounted and coverslipped with
Permount (Fisher Scientific). Cell numbers and region volumes for the interpeduncular
nucleus, ventral tegmental area and ventromedial hypothalamus were quantified under 40×
magnification using unbiased stereological methods and the optical fractionator probe with
Stereo Investigator software (MicroBrightField, Inc., Williston, VT). This method of
assessing total volume and cell number has been validated and employed in many prior
studies. Total cell counts and area measurements were determined for each brain area, and
cell density (number of cells per cubic millimeter) was calculated for each subject.
Statistical Analyses
All data were analyzed by one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or t-test using
Graphpad Prism software (La Jolla, CA). Significant main or interaction effects were
followed by Bonferroni or Newman-Keuls post-hoc tests as appropriate. The criterion for
significance was set at p<0.05.

(a) Nicotine self-administration in rats injected with Lenti-Control or Lenti-α5-shRNA in
the MHb. Data are presented as mean (± SEM) number of nicotine infusions earned.
Lentivirus F(1,60)=21.07, p<0.01; Dose F(6,60)=3.84, p<0.01; Interaction F(6,60)=1.57, n.s.;;
n=5–7 per group. (b) ICSS self-stimulation thresholds in rats. Data are presented as mean (±
SEM) percentage change from baseline reward threshold. Lentivirus F(1,60)=13.23, p<0.001;
Dose F(5,60)=6.38, p<0.0001; Interaction F(5,60)=4.19, p<0.01. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 and
***p<0.001 indicates statistically significant difference between groups; n=6–8 per group.

Figure 4. Nicotine-induced activation of IPN in mice

(a) Photomicrograph of IPN showing Fos immunoreactivity in wildtype (left panels) and α5
knockout (right panels) mice following saline (top panels), 0.5 mg kg−1 nicotine (center
panels), or 1.5 mg kg−1 nicotine (bottom panels); n=5 per group. (b) Cell density was
quantified with unbiased stereology. Data are presented as the mean (± SEM) density of
Fos-immunoreactive cells (number per mm3). Genotype F(1,24)=13.50, p<0.01; Drug
F(2,24)=21.13, p<0.0001; Interaction F(2,24)=8.64, p<0.01.

Figure 5. Disruption of IPN or MHb signaling increases nicotine intake in rats

Author Manuscript

All data are presented as mean (± SEM) number of nicotine infusions earned. (a) Lidocaine
infused into IPN increased nicotine intake in rats; **P<0.01. (b) Lidocaine into MHb
increased nicotine intake in rats self-administering a high unit dose (0.12 mg kg−1 per
infusion); *P<0.05. (c) LY235959 infused into IPN increased nicotine intake in rats (n=9).
F(3,24)=6.08, p<0.01. *P<0.05 and **p<0.01 compared to control. (d) LY235959 (10 ng/
side) into MHb increased nicotine intake in rats responding for a high unit dose (0.12 mg
kg−1 per infusion; n=5); *P<0.05.
