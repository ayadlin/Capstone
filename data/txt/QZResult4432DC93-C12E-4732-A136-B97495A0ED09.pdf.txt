ABSTRACT
Multiple carcinomas including breast, ovarian, colon, lung and stomach cancer,
overexpress the hyaluronic acid (HA) receptor, CD44. Overexpression of CD44
contributes to key cancer processes including tumor invasion, metastasis, recurrence,
and chemoresistance. Herein, we devised novel targeted nanoparticles (NPs) for delivery
of anticancer chemotherapeutics, comprised of self-assembling Maillard reaction-based
conjugates of HA and bovine serum albumin (BSA). HA served as the hydrophilic block,
and as the ligand for actively targeting cancer cells overexpressing CD44. We demonstrate
that Maillard reaction-based covalent conjugates of BSA-HA self-assemble into NPs, which
efficiently entrap hydrophobic cytotoxic drugs including paclitaxel and imidazoacridinones.
Furthermore, BSA-HA conjugates stabilized paclitaxel and prevented its aggregation
and crystallization. The diameter of the NPs was < 15 nm, thus enabling CD44 receptormediated endocytosis. These NPs were selectively internalized by ovarian cancer cells
overexpressing CD44, but not by cognate cells lacking this HA receptor. Moreover, free
HA abolished the endocytosis of drug–loaded BSA-HA conjugates. Consistently, drugloaded NPs were markedly more cytotoxic to cancer cells overexpressing CD44 than to
cells lacking CD44, due to selective internalization, which could be competitively inhibited
by excess free HA. Finally, a CD44-targeted antibody which blocks receptor activity,
abolished internalization of drug-loaded NPs. In conclusion, a novel cytotoxic drug-loaded
nanomedicine platform has been developed, which is based on natural biocompatible
biopolymers, capabale of targeting cancer cells with functional surface expression of CD44.

INTRODUCTION

it is biocompatible and non-immunogenic and could
therefore be an ideal biomaterial for drug delivery and
tissue engineering [7]. Many of the downstream pathways
following CD44 activation become deregulated in cancer,
leading to tumor growth, progression and metastasis [5, 8].
During carcinogenesis, expression of the standard CD44
form is up-regulated in various carcinomas including
breast, ovarian, colon, lung and stomach cancer [9, 10]. HA
oligosaccharides show high affinity to CD44 receptors [5].
Serum albumin (SA) is an abundant globular protein
whose remarkable water solubility is due to the presence
of a large number of ionizable amino acid side groups on

Active targeting based on molecular recognition
is an effective modality to enhance drug selectivity and
efficacy, and to reduce chemotherapeutic drug doses and
side effects [1–3]. One approach to achieve active targeting
is by designing NPs decorated with hyaluronic acid (HA),
to target the CD44 receptor, which is overexpressed
on the surface of various carcinomas [4,  5]. HA is a
glycosaminoglycan of the extracellular matrix consisting
of tandem repeats of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-Dglucosamine [6]. Since HA is a physiological constituent,

its surface [11, 12]. The primary physiological function
of SA is to transport proteins, metal ions, lipids and other
metabolites through the plasma [13]; hence, SA is a highly
proficient carrier for drugs, in particular lipophilic drugs
[14–16]. Since bovine serum albumin (BSA) is highly
homologous to human serum albumin (HSA), we used it
here as a model, with the aim to use HSA in future clinical
studies. The amine side groups of certain amino acids in
SA including lysines, arginines, histidines and tryptophans
can react with the reducing aldehyde group of HA by the
Maillard reaction [17, 18]. The latter is a non-enzymatic
browning reaction, common in food, which is initiated by
heating a dry mixture or a solution of a carbonyl-containing
compound (usually a reducing sugar) and an amine
residue-containing compound, usually an amino acid,
a peptide or a protein [17–19]. The Maillard reaction is
accelerated by heat, without relying on catalyst molecules,
and it is capable of improving the functional properties of
the protein such as solubility, heat stability, self-assembly
and emulsifying capacity [17, 20]. Maillard reaction-based
conjugates of HA and SA have not been reported to date.
We hypothesized that Maillard HA-SA conjugates would
form a self-assembling, actively targeted, biocompatible
and biodegradable polymeric nano-carrier, which would
be able to entrap hydrophobic chemotherapeutics. Hence,
this will provide major advantages in hydrophobic drug
encapsulation, stabilization, selective targeting, and
controlled release. HA bound to its CD44 receptor may
be actively internalized into cells via receptor-mediated
endocytosis, followed by lysosomal proteolytic breakdown
and intracellular release of the cytotoxic drug cargo
[5, 7]. Thus, HA may simultaneously serve as both the
hydrophilic external domain of the block-copolymeric
nano-carrier and as the targeting ligand, to achieve a
Trojan horse effect [7, 21].
Paclitaxel (PTX), a hydrophobic chemotherapeutic
drug that is widely used against a spectrum of solid tumors
[22, 23], blocks mitosis by binding to β-tubulin, resulting
in abnormal promotion of tubulin polymerization [24].
Due to its high lipophilicity, aqueous solubilization of
PTX is required [23]. As with most chemotherapeutic
regimens, PTX causes significant side effects including
peripheral neurotoxicity due to the lack of sufficient
selectivity [25, 26]. Moreover, since the bio-accessibility
of these anti-mitotic agents to tumors is limited, large
doses are used. This consequently leads to untoward
toxicity to healthy cells, as well as increased incidence of
multidrug resistance (MDR) to multiple structurally and
mechanistically distinct anticancer drugs [27].
Imidazoacridinones (IAs) are naturally fluorescent
compounds having a hydrophobic weak base structure,
characteristic to many anti-cancer chemotherapeutics.
Certain acridinone derivatives are new potent cytotoxic
agents which have shown promise against leukemia,
melanoma, breast cancer and others [28, 29]. IAs
apparently function via several mechanisms such as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

arresting the cell in the G2 phase of the cell cycle,
inducing cell death, inhibiting cleavable complexes of
topoisomerase II with DNA, intercalating into DNA and
binding to the minor groove [29–31].
Conventional chemotherapy requires high drug
doses, frequently causing severe toxic side effects due to
insufficient selectivity, and exhibits limited efficacy due
to the frequent emergence of MDR phenomena. One of
the dominant mechanisms of MDR is mediated by efflux
pumps of the ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) superfamily
which exert enhanced extrusion of various hydrophobic
and amphiphilic cytotoxic drugs [28, 32–34]. One of the
strategies to overcome MDR is by using novel NP systems
[33]. Actively targeted NPs (e.g. based on HA targeting
to its CD44 receptor) may evade drug efflux mechanisms
by facilitating antitumor drug entry into tumor cells via
receptor-mediated endocytosis, hence releasing the drug
cargo from the endo-lysosomal compartment into the
cytoplasm.
The aim of the current study was to devise a novel
anticancer drug delivery system based on self-assembling
Maillard HA-BSA conjugates, to characterize it, load it
with an antitumor drug (such as PTX and the IA C-1375)
and evaluate drug binding, selective uptake and cytotoxicity
to cancer cells. The NPs were designed to selectively target
CD44-overexpressing (e.g. ovarian) cancer cells, and HA
served both as the hydrophilic block of the amphiphilic
copolymer, and as the active targeting ligand.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Conjugation of HA with BSA by the Maillard
reaction
BSA-HA Maillard conjugates were prepared as
described in the Methods section, and analyzed by SDS–
PAGE. Figure 1A describes the SDS-PAGE analysis of
BSA-HA conjugates at a molar ratio of 1:5 after different
times of incubation at 60oC. HA has one reducing end group
which may covalently react with an amine residue of lysine,
arginine or tryptophan of BSA. Hence, BSA can readily
form a Maillard reaction conjugate with a few molecules of
HA, whereas an HA molecule can only react directly with
a single BSA molecule. This characteristic is advantageous
for the construction of small block copolymeric conjugates,
rather than large network structures. Unheated BSA (lane 1)
was predominantly unconjugated (~67 kDa, marked by
a rectangle), whereas upon increasing heating times, the
primary 67 kDa BSA band gradually disappeared and some
higher molecular mass bands emerged. This result provided
direct evidence for the formation of higher MW BSA-HA
Maillard conjugates. Notably, the samples remained white
after heating, hence confirming that the Maillard reaction
was successfully terminated at sufficiently early stages
before melanoidins formed, but certainly after conjugation
had occurred.

Characterization of the self-assembled BSA-HA
NPs in terms of size distribution and colloidal
stability

enhance the binding affinity to hydrophobic drugs, and
self-assembly of the conjugates. On the other hand, one
may raise the possibility that the potential unfolding might
increase immunogenicity of SA. However, since SA is
expected to be in the NP core, decorated with multiple HA
molecules, this should markedly reduce the likelihood of
immunogenicity.
Figure 1C exhibits the particle size distribution
of BSA-HA at a 1:5 molar ratio as a function of heating
time. Pure unheated BSA is also shown for comparison
and it has two sub-populations: apparently monomers and
aggregates of BSA. Pure HA (6–10 kDa; < 1 nm) is too
small for analysis by dynamic light scattering (DLS), but
the addition of HA to BSA, shifts the observed distribution
to lower values, as may be inferred from the 2 hr graph.
Larger sizes are expectedly observed with increased
heating time. However, Figure 1C shows that at the various
heating times, the BSA-HA conjugates are < 25 nm. One
hr of heating resulted in three sub-populations: apparently,
molecules of BSA alone and two sizes (5 and 10 nm) of
BSA-HA particles, which may be BSA-HA conjugates,
and their self-assembled aggregates. After 4 and 5 hr of
heating, the size was found to be larger with a monomodal distribution, suggesting that most of the BSA is
HA-conjugated, and the conjugates were self-assembled
into more uniform micellar aggregates. An interesting
question was considered, whether or not the conjugates
can self-assemble, as it is possible that when multiple HA
molecules are bound per BSA molecule, a unimolecular
“micelle” is formed with a hydrophobic core and a
hydrophilic corona, which cannot self-assemble. Such
a unimolecular micelle may still serve as a nanovehicle,
but it is likely to be more difficult to load with significant
drug cargo, and it may not be very effective in suppressing
drug crystallization, as it would not be able to adsorb to
hydrophobic drug nanocrystal surfaces.
To determine whether or not, conjugates prepared at
different molar ratios and heating times can self-assemble,
the micellization of BSA-HA conjugates was evaluated
by determining their CMC, using pyrene as a fluorescent
probe for hydrophobic domain formation [36] (Figure 2A).

The molecular mass and size distribution of the
conjugate particles in solution were explored (Figure 1B
and 1C, respectively). Figure 1B shows the molecular
mass of BSA-HA conjugates at 5 heating times (each
heating time is designated by a different color); the area of
each circle at a given heating time indicates the percentage
of each sub-population in the solution. It is evident that
the most prevalent molecular mass species (56 kDa) in
the mixture (of BSA and HA without heating) is relatively
close to the molecular mass of BSA (~67 kDa). HA alone
(6–10 kDa; < 1 nm) was below the size-detection limit of
the MALLS instrument used. After 1 hr of heating, the
molecular mass had not significantly changed. However,
additional heating time up to 5 hr at 60oC resulted in
increased molecular mass and eventually in an almost
mono-modal distribution. Expectedly, the molecular mass
of BSA-HA conjugates increased with increasing Maillard
reaction incubation times as well as with increasing
HA:BSA molar ratio (Results not shown). We have
chosen to continue our study with BSA-HA conjugates
formed after 3 hr of Maillard reaction, having an average
molecular mass of 162 kDa (Figure 1C). Such an average
molecular mass of a conjugate may be composed of ~13
HA molecules (average MW of 6.4 kDa) conjugated
to a single BSA molecule (67 kDa). Nevertheless, it
should be noted, that a disulfide-bonded BSA dimer with
4 conjugated HA molecules is also possible, as well as
other combinations within the molecular mass dispersity
of the products. BSA contains 59 lysine residues, (although
only 30–35 are accessible for coupling reactions [35]),
as well as 23 arginine-, 17 histidine- and 2 tryptophan
residues [11, 12]. Hence, assuming 13 HA molecules
and a single BSA molecule per conjugate, ~13% of the
Maillard-reactive amino acid side groups of BSA appear
to have participated in the Maillard reaction. However,
the moist heating involved in the Maillard reaction
process may induce partial unfolding of SA, which should

Pyrene is an uncharged hydrophobic molecule whose
fluorescence is strongly influenced by the polarity of its
nano-environment. The solubility of pyrene in water is
very poor and its fluorescence is well characterized [37].
Figure 2A shows that the CMC of BSA-HA conjugates was
expectedly higher compared to that of BSA alone [CMC
(HA-BSA  conjugates) = (0.033 ± 0.002) mg/ml; CMC
(BSA) = (0.0041 ± 0.0008 mg/ml]. HA is a hydrophilic
polymer, which interferes sterically and electrostatically
with the hydrophobic interaction-driven aggregation
or self-assembly of BSA molecules. Hence, the entire
conjugate is more hydrophilic than pure BSA, and requires
higher concentrations to induce its self-assembly. Figure 2B
shows the size distributions of BSA-HA conjugates at
different concentrations. At a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml,
larger particles started to appear. This result is consistent
with the CMC obtained using the pyrene fluorescence
technique (~0.033 mg/ml). Increasing BSA-HA conjugate
concentrations >0.5 mg/ml resulted in larger NPs, whereas
at a concentration of 5 mg/ml, all of the NPs were > 10 nm.
Indeed, we found that the conjugates did self-assemble,
and determined their CMC and micellization cooperativity.
We observed that following different heating times and at
all molar ratios studied (Results not shown), all BSA-HA
conjugates self-assembled with a CMC value higher than
that of unconjugated BSA (Figure 2A). These findings
do not support the unimolecular micelle hypothesis, but
favor instead, the self-assembling conjugates, which are
preferable for higher drug loading.
An additional attribute studied herein was the zeta
potential of BSA-HA conjugates, calculated based on the

measured electrophoretic mobility. HA is a polyanion
containing carboxylic groups, hence its negative charge
increases with increasing pH. HA has a pKa value of ~3.0
[38], thus zeta potential was negative, and it decreased
when pH was increased in the measured range. Zeta
potential measurements of pure BSA, pure HA and
BSA-HA conjugate solutions in PBS vs. pH are depicted
in  Figure 3. The zeta potential of BSA was positive up
to pH 4.3, in reasonable agreement with the published
isoelectric point of BSA, 4.7 [39]. The zeta potential of
BSA-HA conjugates was thus mostly found between those
of pure BSA and pure HA. Suspensions with zeta potential
values more negative than –40 mV usually have good
colloidal stability [40, 41]. The zeta potential (Figure 3) can
be calculated from the measured electrophoretic mobility
using several available theoretical models. The choice of
a suitable model is based on the value of κ·a where “a”
is the particle size and “κ−1” is the Debye length. The two
commonly used models are the Smoluchowski model,
which is applicable when κ·a is significantly > 1 and the
Huckel model, which is applicable when κ·a is < 1 [42]. In
our current system, the product of κ·a was approximately
1.5, hence in this case, neither the Smoluchowski model
nor the Huckel model were strictly applicable. However,
the Smoluchowski model yields the lowest absolute value
of zeta potential estimate for a given electrophoretic
mobility value among the commonly used models [40];
thus, stability prediction based on the Smoluchowski model
is considered to be the most conservative. Therefore, taking
the Smoluchowski model as a safe underestimation (in
absolute value), the zeta potential of BSA-HA conjugates

at pH 7.4 (the physiological pH which we mimicked using
a PBS environment) was determined to be < –40 mV
(ζ(Smoluchowski) ~ –45 mV), indicating good colloidal
stability.

BSA-HA conjugate NPs. Hence, these results indicate that
BSA-HA conjugate NPs effectively stabilize PTX against
aggregation and crystallization. The NP size distribution
of the drug-loaded conjugates is readily compatible
with endocytosis via binding to CD44, the HA receptor.
Receptor-mediated endocytosis of NPs was consistently
found to be optimal at 25 nm, and possible at least up to
~60 nm [43], whereas for the EPR effect, which is expected
to precede cellular uptake of these NPs, a range of 10–200
nm was reported to be suitable [3, 44].

Entrapment of PTX within BSA-HA micellar
NPs
Interaction of PTX with BSA-HA conjugates
The entrapment of PTX within the BSA-HA conjugate
(5:1 molar ratio, 3 hr of heating) micelles was achieved by
adding PTX (dissolved in DMSO) into a solution of the
BSA-HA conjugates while continuously stirring. Figure 4A
shows that the absorbance spectrum of PTX entrapped
within BSA-HA conjugates was lower than the sum of the
absorbance spectra of non-encapsulated PTX and of BSAHA conjugates. This deviation from additivity evidences
the binding of PTX to BSA-HA conjugates.

Cryo-TEM images
A closer observation, at a much higher
magnification, was performed using Cryo-TEM, as shown
in Figure 5A and 5B. BSA-HA conjugates were mostly
<10 nm (based on the DLS- Figure 4B, dashed line, and
Figure 5A, small arrows), apparently containing one
or a few molecules of BSA, each decorated with a few
molecules of HA (small covalently conjugated oligomers
of BSA formed via disulfide bonding during the heating
to form the Maillard conjugates), and self-assembled
particles, probably containing many molecules of BSAHA conjugates (10–20 nm, Figure 4B, dashed line,
and Figure 5A, large arrows). In samples with added
PTX (Figure 5B), small rod-like drug nanocrystals and
spherical droplet-like drug aggregates were observed,
surrounded by adsorbed BSA-HA conjugates (~60–80 nm
based on DLS Figure 4B, solid line, and Figure 5B), which
stabilized them and prevented them from undergoing
further crystal growth or aggregation. The particles were
mostly between 10–60 nm (Figure 5B). Consistently, we
have previously observed a similar effect of β-casein on
PTX crystallization [45, 46].

Nanoparticle size distribution
Size distribution of the co-assembled BSA-HA-PTX
NPs was analyzed by DLS (Figure 4B). The mean diameter
of BSA-HA conjugates was < 15 nm. Non-encapsulated
PTX exhibited a mean diameter of about 1000 nm (this
is close to the upper detection limit of the DLS used). In
fact, non-encapsulated PTX formed crystalline µm-sized
aggregates. PTX-loaded BSA-HA conjugate NPs exhibited
three particle size sub-populations: one of ~7 nm, another
of ~20–40 nm and a small sub-population of ~85 nm. The
diameter of PTX-loaded BSA-HA conjugate NPs was
similar to that of non-loaded BSA-HA conjugate NPs
without the large sub-population typical to the free drug,
demonstrating the effective entrapment of the drug by the

Entrapment of the imidazoacridinone C-1375
within the BSA-HA micellar NPs

basis. Measurements were performed in duplicates at room
temperature. Results are shown in Figure 6:
The mixed solution absorbance is expected to be
additive, unless an association occurs between the observed
solution components. It is evident that the mix absorbance
curve is higher than the curve of the mathematical
summation up to ~50 µM C-1375 (Figure 6A).

Interaction of IA C-1375 with BSA-HA conjugates
UV-vis absorbance spectra were used to study
the binding of IA C-1375 to BSA-HA conjugates. The
samples were at a concentration of 1 mg/ml on a protein

At 50 µM, the mathematical summation is nearly equal
to the mix absorbance. These results are due to C-1375
sensitivity to its environment, as the absorbance of
C-1375 changes in response to the hydrophobicity of its
environment. We suggest that several BSA-HA conjugates
interact through hydrophobic interactions of hydrophobic
BSA domains, thereby creating a hydrophobic core in
which the C-1375 is entrapped. At 65 µM of C-1375,
the mathematical summation of the absorbance exceeds
the absorbance of the mix. Above 50 µM of C-1375, the
self-assembled conjugates apparently cannot entrap the
excess ligand and the free C-1375 aggregates enhance its
absorbance, thus the absorbance summation is higher than
the absorbance of the mix.
Figure 6B presents the quantitative difference
between the absorbance of the mix and the absorbance
summation [47] of separate HA and BSA solutions.
One can infer from Figure 6B that the maximal molar
loading ratio of C-1375 in the BSA-HA conjugates is
8:1. Figure 7A displays the absorbance of C-1375 in
water and in several organic solvents (ethanol, methanol,
and acetonitrile). Figure 7C describes the absorbance
percentage with respect to that of pure C-1375 as a
function of the concentration of BSA-HA conjugates. The
fluorescence emission spectrum in several organic solvents
(water, ethanol, methanol, and acetonitrile) is described in
Figure 7B. The fluorescence emission intensity at 550 nm
(excitation at 435 nm) as a function of the concentration of
the BSA-HA conjugates is presented in Figure 7D.
It is apparent from Figure 7A that C-1375
absorbance changes in response to the hydrophobicity
of its environment. The absorbance of C-1375 in a
hydrophilic solvent, water, is much lower compared to that
in organic solvents. These results can help explaining the
results shown in Figure 7C, in which increased BSA-HA
concentration resulted in increased absorbance of C-1375
at 444 nm. We conclude that BSA-HA conjugates self-

assembled and thus formed hydrophobic domains in which
C-1375 was entrapped.
A hypochromic effect (blue shift) due to an increase
in the hydrophobicity of the organic solvent resulting in a
lower wavelength peak has been observed in Figure 7B.
Furthermore, it is evident from Figure 7D that addition
of BSA-HA conjugates to pure C-1375 increases the
emission intensity of C-1375 at 550 nm. Therefore, both
the increasing absorbance (Figure 7C) and the increasing
fluorescence intensity (Figure 7D) of C-1375 with
increasing BSA-HA conjugate concentrations, indicate the
entrapment of this drug within the self-assembled BSAHA conjugates.

Nanoparticle size distribution
Size distribution analysis of the co-assembled BSAHA-C-1375 NPs was performed by DLS (Figure 8).
For C-1375 alone, we observed three subpopulations, most of the particles were >1 µm, and two
minor sub-populations were centered between 50 and
70 nm. However, for drug encapsulated in BSA-HA
conjugates there was a single population, showing the same
size distribution observed for BSA-HA conjugates alone,
demonstrating the efficient entrapment of the drug by the
BSA-HA conjugate NPs. To determine the association
coefficient, we used the Benesi-Hildebrand model [47]. The
absorbance was determined at 444 nm (at which C-1375
absorbs, while BSA-HA conjugates do not) as a function
of BSA-HA concentration, thus the change in absorbance is
caused only by the formation of complexes of C-1375 and
BSA-HA conjugates; results are shown in Figure 9.
The results indicate that C-1375 has a high affinity
for BSA-HA conjugates, and the association coefficient
estimated by the Benesi-Hildebrand method was found to be:
Ka = (1.33 ± 0.26) ∙ 106 M–1 i.e., a remarkably high
association affinity.

the naturally fluorescent cytotoxic agent C-1375. Colocalization of red and green fluorescent dyes (resulting
in orange-yellow fluorescence) provided evidence for the
internalization of C-1375-loaded BSA-HA NPs into endolysosomes, via CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis. As
detailed above, this selective targeting was explored using
a cognate pair of two human ovarian cancer cell lines:
SKOV3 which displays overexpression of CD44, the
HA receptor, and A2780 cells which are devoid of CD44
expression.
Expectedly, in the control groups, incubation of
BSA, HA, and HA-BSA conjugates without C-1375
showed no green fluorescence (Figure 11A–11C and
Figure 12A–12C). In contrast, when cells were incubated
with the free C-1375 drug which is intrinsically green
fluorescent (Figures 11D, 12D), it equally entered both
SKOV-3 and A2780 cells by diffusion, independently
of the presence of CD44. Furthermore, when cells were
incubated with a drug that was encapsulated in the BSAHA conjugates, the drug was delivered solely into CD44containing SKOV3 cells (Figure 12F). These BSA-HA
conjugates loaded with C-1375 were selectively taken up

by human ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells overexpressing
the HA receptor CD44 via endocytosis, but not by A2780
cells which are devoid of CD44 expression (Figure 11F).
Following endocytosis, the drug-loaded NPs were found
to concentrate within lysosomes, suggesting an efficient
targeted uptake. This finding supports the conclusion
that the uptake of the BSA-HA NPs was mediated by the
CD44 receptor. To verify that this internalization of HAdecorated BSA NPs occurred via the HA receptor CD44,
a 100-fold molar excess of free HA was added to SKOV3
cells (Figure 12H); this markedly eliminated the orange
fluorescence signal, which reflects the co-localization of
the green C-1375 fluorescence and the LysoTracker red
fluorescence in lysosomes. This elimination of the orange
fluorescence was due to a competition of free HA with
HA-BSA conjugates for CD44 receptor binding. This
competition did not occur in A2780 cells which are devoid
of detectable CD44 levels (Figure 11H). To ensure that
the selective internalization of HA-BSA NP was mediated
via the CD44 receptor, we blocked CD44 activity using a
CD44-blocking antibody. Blocking CD44 receptor activity
markedly eliminated the orange fluorescence signal in
human ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells overexpressing the

determine the C-1375 - BSA-HA conjugates association constant.

HA receptor CD44, but not in A2780 cells which are
devoid of CD44 expression (Figure 11G and Figure 12G).
The fact that the Blocking occurred only in SKOV3 cells
and not in A2780 cells which are devoid of detectable
CD44 levels, demonstrated that HA-BSA NP conjugates
were selectively internalized via endocytosis by ovarian
cancer cells, which overexpress the HA receptor CD44, but
not by cognate ovarian cancer cells lacking CD44. Hence,
selective targeting was achieved with HA decoration of
drug-loaded BSA NPs.

approaches have been reported to solubilize PTX using cosolvents and inclusion complexes. In addition, innovative
approaches have been reported for passive targeting of
tumors using NPs, nano-suspensions, liposomes, emulsions,
micelles, implants, pastes and gels [49]. In our present
study, the co-assembly of PTX with BSA-HA conjugates
was achieved by adding PTX dissolved in DMSO, into a
BSA-HA conjugate solution while continuously stirring.
BSA-HA conjugates co-assembled with PTX most likely
via hydrophobic interactions. Because PTX is highly
hydrophobic, it tends to minimize water contact by
aggregating and by adsorbing to hydrophobic domains of
the BSA protein within the co-assembled NPs. The cytotoxic
activity of non-encapsulated PTX was explored compared
to PTX encapsulated in BSA-HA conjugates. Moreover,
PTX encapsulated in BSA-HA conjugates was studied with
excess free HA, as a competitor of the BSA-HA conjugates,
for binding to the CD44 receptor.
The IC50 values of the four independent
determinations are depicted in Figure 13. Free PTX was
markedly less cytotoxic than PTX encapsulated in BSAHA NPs, towards SKOV3 cells which overexpress CD44
(IC50: 113.9 ± 8.0 and 18.7 ± 3.5 respectively, p-value =
0.04), suggesting that lower drug concentrations would be
needed in the presence of the conjugate NPs, which should
significantly reduce harmful side effects.

Cytotoxicity assays
PTX displays a wide spectrum of antitumor activity,
particularly against ovarian cancer, breast cancer, non-small
cell lung cancer, head and neck tumors, Kaposi’s sarcoma,
and urologic malignancies. PTX is a highly lipophilic
compound with a log P value of 3.96 and a very poor aqueous
solubility of < 0.01 mg/ml [48]. Moreover, PTX is devoid of
functional ionizable groups. Hence, the delivery of PTX to
cancer cells is associated with substantial challenges. Until
the introduction of Abraxane (a SA-bound PTX, currently
used as the first line of treatment of metastatic pancreatic
adenocarcinoma), the only commercial PTX formulation
was a solution of PTX in Cremophor EL, which caused
severe side effects. However, in recent years, a number of

added for 1 hr prior to BSA-HA conjugates). LysoTracker red DND99 (100 nM) was added for 1 hr prior to fluorescence cell imaging. The

Cell-Observer microscope at ×630 magnification.

The addition of free HA to SKOV3 cells markedly
decreased the cytotoxicity of PTX-loaded BSA-HA NPs
(IC50: 132.4 ± 17.4). This result is due to a competition
of free HA with BSA-HA conjugates for binding to the
CD44 receptor, thereby establishing a specific interaction
of the HA-decorated NP-containing PTX with CD44.
The IC50 value (Figure 13) of PTX entrapped in the BSAHA conjugates in the presence of excess free HA was
significantly higher than that in the absence of free HA,
providing direct evidence for the CD44-mediated uptake
of the drug-loaded NPs. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of free
PTX and PTX-encapsulated in BSA-HA NPs was similar
towards A2780 cells which lack the CD44 receptor (IC50:
91.9 ± 7.8 and 62.3 ± 18.3, respectively, p-value = 0.6).
Incubation of A2780 ovarian cancer cells in the presence
of excess free HA did not change the cytotoxicity of PTXloaded BSA-HA NPs. These results support the conclusion
that BSA-HA NP conjugates are selectively internalized by
human ovarian cancer cells which overexpress the CD44
receptor but not by cells lacking this HA receptor. Based
on these encouraging findings we propose a summary
model of the BSA-HA nanovehicle entrapping cytotoxic
drugs (e.g. PTX and C-1375, Fig 14).
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that HA
was covalently attached to BSA via the Maillard reaction
by controlled heating. The mean diameter of BSA-HA
NPs was <15 nm. BSA-HA conjugates self-assembled
with a CMC value higher than that of BSA alone. BSAHA conjugates stabilized PTX against aggregation and
suppressed the growth of its nanocrystals, hence forming
NPs of < 100 nm. C-1375 was found to be entrapped

within a hydrophobic core formed by self-assembly of HABSA conjugates, exhibiting a remarkable binding constant
(Ka) of (1.33 ± 0.26) × 106 M–1. BSA-HA conjugates
were selectively internalized by human ovarian cancer
SKOV3 cells overexpressing the HA receptor, CD44, but
not by cognate cells (A2780) lacking CD44 expression.
PTX-loaded BSA-HA conjugate NPs displayed highly
selective cytotoxicity to tumor cells overexpressing
CD44 (SKOV3), but not to cells lacking CD44 (A2780);
this difference could be markedly diminished by
competition with excess free HA or by blocking CD44
with an antibody, hence evidencing in three ways the
selective CD44-mediated uptake of these NPs. Based on
these findings we conclude that BSA-HA conjugate NPs
selectively targeted and entered CD44-overexpressing
ovarian cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis.
Taken collectively, these findings suggest that
these BSA-HA conjugate NPs may be used as a nanodelivery platform for targeted delivery of hydrophobic
chemotherapeutic drugs, and possibly also drug
combinations including MDR inhibitors.

dissolved in DMSO (Loba Chemie, Mumbai, India) at
a concentration of 10 mM. Rabbit monoclonal antibody
(EPR1013Y) against human CD44 was from Abcam
(Cambridge UK). Alexa Fluor® 700 anti-mouse/human
CD44 was purchased from ENCO (Petach-Tiqva Israel).
Human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines SKOV3 and
A2780 were cultured in McCoy’s 5A and RPMI-1640
media, respectively (Biological Industries, Kibbutz
Beit-Haemek, Israel), which were supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100
units/ml streptomycin, 1% sodium pyruvate, 2.5%
Hepes buffer to maintain physiological pH of 7.3 (final
Hepes concentration of 25 mM) and 1% L-glutamine
(Biological Industries). Cells were incubated at 37°C in a
5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The imidazoacridinone
C-1375 was synthesized by Prof. M. Cholody, B.
Horowska and M. Konieczny and kindly provided by
Prof. A. Skladanowski, Gdansk University, Gdansk,

Preparation of BSA-HA conjugates by the Maillard
reaction.
BSA-HA conjugates were prepared as follows:
solutions of BSA and HA, at different molar ratios, were
prepared in HPLC-grade water. To facilitate the Maillard
reaction, the pH of the solutions was adjusted to 8 by
adding NaOH. The solutions were then freeze-dried and
placed over a saturated KBr solution in a desiccator,
to maintain constant relative humidity of 79.9%. The
desiccator was kept in a thermostatic oven at 60°C [50]
for different heating times of 1 to 23 hr. Samples were
then removed from the oven, freeze-dried and stored at
–20°C for further analysis. The molecular mass of BSAHA conjugates was evaluated by sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). Briefly,
proteins were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels
containing SDS as previously described [46].

Molecular weight distribution

Entrapment of PTX within BSA-HA conjugates

The molecular weight of BSA-HA conjugates
(1:5 molar ratio) was determined in duplicates at room
temperature, using size exclusion HPLC with a multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS) detector (DAWN
EOS, Wyatt Technology Corporation Santa Barbara,
CA, USA) combined with a refractive index based
concentration detector (Optilab Rex, Wyatt Technology).
The BSA-HA conjugates sample concentration was 1.2 mg
protein/ml.

Entrapment of PTX within BSA-HA conjugates was
achieved by adding PTX dissolved in DMSO ( 1.5%), into
a solution of the BSA-HA conjugates while continuously
stirring, similarly to the method we previously used to
entrap PTX and other drugs in β-casein micelles [52–54].
DMSO was not removed as it is not harmful to cells at
such low concentrations [55], and is commonly used in IV
chemotherapeutic treatments.

Cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy
(cryo-TEM) imaging

Particle size distribution
Particle size distribution was evaluated using a DLS
analyzer (NicompTM 380, PSS Inc., Santa Barbara, CA,
USA). Measurements were performed in triplicates at
room temperature.

Cryo-TEM was used for the imaging of
PTX  entrapped in BSA-HA conjugate NPs at a 2:1
molar ratio in phosphate buffer containing 0.8% DMSO.
An image of BSA-HA conjugates in the same buffer
solution was taken for comparison. Vitrified specimens
for cryo-TEM were prepared in a controlled environment
vitrification system at 25 ± 0.01°C and 95–99% relative
humidity, to ensure a constant temperature and to avoid
water loss from the solution during sample preparation. The
specimens were prepared as thin liquid films (10–500 nm
thick), on perforated carbon films and quench-frozen
in liquid ethane at its freezing point (–183°C).  This
procedure is designed to prevent water crystallization
during thermal fixation. In this manner, component
segregation and rearrangement are mostly prevented,
and the original fluid nanostructure is preserved.  The
technique and apparatus were previously described in
detail by Bellare et al., [56]. The vitrified samples were
then stored under liquid nitrogen (-196°C), transferred
to a Gatan 626 cooling holder via its “work station”, and
observed in a Philips CM120 microscope at about 175°C.
Images were recorded at a 120 kV acceleration voltage,
in a low-dose mode, to minimize electron-beam radiation
damage. Gatan Multi Scan 791 cooled CCD camera was
used to acquire the images, with the Digital Micrograph
3.1 software package. Images were recorded under focus
of about 2 µm to enhance phase contrast.

Zeta-potential measurements
Nicomp 380 ZLS analyzer was used for zeta
potential measurements of BSA, HA and BSA-HA
conjugates. Samples were dissolved at 20 mM Phosphate/
phosphate-citrate buffers at pH values of 2.5–7.2 and a
concentration of 0.6 mg protein/ml and stirred overnight.

Determination of critical micellization
concentration
The self-assembly of BSA-HA conjugates
was studied by determining the critical micellization
concentration (CMC) of the conjugates using pyrene as a
hydrophobic fluorescent probe, which alters its emission
spectrum in hydrophobic environments. The CMC was
determined in the presence of a low and constant pyrene
concentration (1 µM), based on the increase in pyrene
fluorescence intensity ratio I3:I1 during its partitioning
into hydrophobic domains formed upon micellization
[36]. The CMC was estimated by using the following
semi-empirical mathematical model (Equations 1,2)
we have previously developed [51] to describe protein
micellization:

Binding studies by UV-vis absorbance spectra
Ultraviolet-visible
(UV-vis)
absorbance
spectroscopy was used to study the binding of drugs (PTX
or C-1375) to BSA-HA conjugates. The samples were set
at a concentration of 1 mg protein/ml. The differences
between the absorbance spectra of the mixed BSA-HAdrug solution (PTX or C-1375) and the mathematical
summation of the spectra of BSA-HA solution and ligand
solution (PTX or C-1375) served to assess whether or not
binding occurred. UV-Vis spectra were measured by a UVVis spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 3000, GE Healthcare).

Binding constant determination

For the detection of CD44, rabbit monoclonal antibody
(EPR1013Y) was used at a dilution of 1:5,000. Blots
were then rinsed and reacted with a secondary antibody
consisting of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 dilution, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) for 1 hr at room temperature. Following three 10-min
washes in TBS at room temperature, enhanced
chemiluminescence detection was performed. To normalize
for any differences in actual protein loading, the blots were
stripped and re-probed with a monoclonal antibody to
β-actin (1:4,000 dilution; Chemicon, Temecula, CA).

The binding constant was determined using the
Benesi-Hildebrand method [57, 58] (Equation 3). The
absorbance at 444 nm of C-1375 in phosphate buffer
and different concentrations of BSA-HA conjugates was
determined.

ΔA is the change in absorbance at 444 nm at
different concentrations of BSA-HA conjugates varying
from 0 to 1.25 mg protein/ml. Δε 500 is the differential
extinction coefficient at 444 nm. The final concentration of
C-1375 was 15 µM. The extinction coefficient of C-1375
at 444 nm was determined according to Beer-Lambert
law [59].

Selective targeting of BSA-HA NPs to CD44
expressing cancer cells
The selective targeting of BSA-HA conjugates to
human carcinoma cells which overexpress CD44 was
studied using C-1375-loaded BSA-HA NPs. This selective
targeting was explored using a pair of two human ovarian
cancer cell lines: SKOV3 which displays overexpression of
CD44, the HA receptor, and A2780 cells which are devoid
of CD44 expression. Cells were seeded in culture dishes
(35 mm) containing cover glass bottom (2×104 cells/2 ml;
World Precision Instruments, NBT New Biotechnology,
Israel) and grown in medium (McCoy and RPMI-1640 for
SKOV3 cells and A2780 cells, respectively). BSA-HA NPs
loaded with C-1375 (10 μM) were added for 2 hr prior to
fluorescence cell imaging (anti-CD44 antibody at a final
concentration of 10 μg/ml was added for 1 hr prior to BSAHA conjugates at the relevant samples). Cells were then
washed with PBS, and LysoTracker red DND99 (100 nM)
was added for 1 hr prior to fluorescence cell imaging. Prior
to analysis, cells were suspended in PBS supplemented
with 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM D-glucose.
Then, random colonies were analyzed using Zeiss
inverted Cell-Observer microscope. The viable DNA dye
Hoechst 33342 (2 mg/ml) was added immediately prior
to microscopic analysis.  Three fluorescence channels
were used during image capturing: (1) Blue for the viable
DNA-dye Hoechst 33342; (2) Red for the viable lysosomal
marker LysoTracker® Red; and (3) Green for the naturally
fluorescent cytotoxic agent C-1375. Co-localization of red
and green fluorescent dyes (resulting in orange-yellow
fluorescence) provided evidence for the internalization of
C-1375-loaded BSA-HA NPs into endo-lysosomes, via
CD44 receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Binding studies by spectrofluorometry
Fluorescence measurements were performed
at room temperature, using a Fluorolog 3–22
spectrofluorometer (Horiba, Jobin Yvon, and Longjumeau,
France). The fluorescence emission spectrum of C-1375
in several organic solvents (water, ethanol, methanol,
and acetonitrile) was determined and compared to the
fluorescence emission of C-1375 in the presence of
increasing concentrations of BSA-HA conjugates.

Tissue culture
Human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell lines
SKOV-3 and A2780 were kindly provided by Dr. I.
Chefetz-Menaker, the Lab of Prof. Gil Mor, Yale
University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA. These tumor
cell lines were cultured in McCoy’s SKOV-3 and RPMI1640 growth media (A2780), supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum and 1 mM L-glutamine. All cell lines were
grown in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator at 37°C.

Western blot analysis
To examine the expression of CD44 in the two
human ovarian cancer cell lines [A2780 and SKOV3],
total cell protein extract was isolated from 2 × 107 cells in
a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris at pH = 7.5, 50 mM
β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Triton ×100, and 1 mM EGTA
in DDW. Following 1 hr incubation on ice, the extract
was centrifuged at 14,000xg for 30 min at 4°C and the
supernatant was collected. Protein content was determined
using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Protein aliquots (60 µg)
were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide
gels containing SDS and electroblotted onto a Protran
BA83-cellulose nitrate membrane (Whatman). The
blots were then blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in
Tris buffered saline (TBS) containing 150 mM NaCl,
20 mM Tris-base at pH 7.6 containing 1% skim milk.

Cytotoxicity Assays
Cytotoxic activity was determined using an XTTbased colorimetric cell proliferation kit (Biological
Industries Israel Beit-Haemek Ltd.). Exponentially
growing cells were seeded at 1x104 cells/well in 96-well
plates. Following an overnight incubation, cells were
exposed to increasing drug concentrations (10 µl drug
solution/well) for 2 hr. Cellular viability was determined

by adding the XTT reagent and an activation reagent at
50:1 v/v ratio and incubating for 1 hr at 37°C. Following
solubilization of the formed formazan dye, absorbance was
determined by a microplate reader. Values presented are
means of three independent experiments, each performed
in triplicates.

Statistical analysis
The characterization of BSA-HA samples and the
encapsulation of PTX were performed in duplicates for
all experiments. An average value and a standard error
were calculated at each point. The cytotoxicity assays
were performed in triplicates. The statistical analysis of
variance of the encapsulated (in the presence or absence
of excess free HA) vs. the non-encapsulated PTX, was
performed using a two-sample T-test, assuming equal
variances, using Microsoft Excel™.
