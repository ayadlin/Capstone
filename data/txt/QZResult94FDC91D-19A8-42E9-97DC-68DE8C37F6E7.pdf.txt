ABSTRACT:
Inhibitors of the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) are of
considerable current interest as targeted cancer therapeutic agents because of
the ability to destabilize multiple oncogenic client proteins. Despite their resulting
pleiotropic effects on multiple oncogenic pathways and hallmark traits of cancer,
resistance to HSP90 inhibitors is possible and their ability to induce apoptosis is less
than might be expected. Using an isogenic model for BAX knockout in HCT116 human
colon carcinoma cells, we demonstrate the induction of BAX-dependent apoptosis
at pharmacologically relevant concentrations of the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG both
in vitro and in tumor xenografts in vivo. Removal of BAX expression by homologous
recombination reduces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo but allows a lower level of cell
death via a predominantly necrotic mechanism. Despite reducing apoptosis, the loss
of BAX does not alter the overall sensitivity to 17-AAG in vitro or in vivo. The results
indicate that 17-AAG acts predominantly to cause a cytostatic antiproliferative effect
rather than cell death and further suggest that BAX status may not alter the overall
clinical response to HSP90 inhibitors. Other agents may be required in combination
to enhance tumor-selective killing by these promising drugs. In addition, there are
implications for the use of apoptotic endpoints in the assessment of the activity of
molecularly targeted agents.

INTRODUCTION

geldanamycin and its derivative 17-allylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) exert their effects by
specifically interacting with the N-terminal ATP binding
domain and inhibiting the intrinsic ATPase activity of
HSP90 which is critical for its chaperone function [3-5].
Subsequently, HSP90 client proteins are degraded via the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [6, 7].
We and others have previously demonstrated that
17-AAG induces depletion of key regulators of signal
transduction in many human tumor models, including
colon and breast cancer [8-10]. The subsequent inhibition
of signal transduction pathways results in the induction

The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90
(HSP90) is of particular interest as a therapeutic target
in cancer owing to its role in maintaining the correct
conformation and stability of a number of key oncogenic
client proteins such as receptor and non-receptor tyrosine
kinases (e.g. ERBB2, ALK, ABL) and serine/threonine
kinases (e.g. CRAF, BRAF, AKT, CDK4), including
especially those with oncogenic abnormalities and drugresistant alleles [1, 2].

of cytostasis and apoptosis, the extent of which is cancer
cell line-dependent. We have shown previously in a
small panel of four human colon adenocarcinomas that
one tumor cell line, KM12, did not exhibit apoptosis in
response to 17-AAG [8]. Unlike the other colon tumor cell
lines in that study, including HCT116 cells, KM12 cells
do not express the pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member
BAX [8]. Based on that observation we hypothesized
that BAX is required for the induction of apoptosis in
response to 17-AAG. To test this we used an isogenic pair
of HCT116 colon cancer cells, in one member of which
BAX was knocked out using homologous recombination
[11]. We found that following 17-AAG treatment BAX
is required for the induction of cell death via the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway. This was true for HCT116 cells in
vitro and also the corresponding solid tumor xenografts
growing in immune-compromised mice. In the absence of
BAX in vitro total cell death was reduced but in the cell
population that did undergo cell death, necrosis became
the predominant mechanism. Interestingly, BAX knockout
had no effect on the overall sensitivity of HCT116 cells
when measured by SRB or MTT cell proliferation assays
in vitro or on the response of HCT116 tumor xenografts
in vivo. The results indicate that cytostatic effects on cell
proliferation may represent the dominant therapeutic
response in this cancer model. They also suggest that BAX
A

status may not alter clinical response to HSP90 inhibitors
and that other agents may be required in combination to
enhance tumor-selective killing by these promising drugs.
In addition, there are implications for the use of apoptotic
endpoints in the assessment of the activity of molecularly
targeted agents.

RESULTS
Confirmation of BAX status and effects of
sulindac sulphide
Previous reports have suggested that the loss
of BAX is sufficient to confer resistance to apoptosis
including that induced by several pharmacological
agents [11]. To determine the role of BAX in 17-AAG
induced apoptosis we used an isogenic pair of HCT116
human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, as previously
described [11]. HCT116 BAX +/- cells are heterozygous for
the BAX gene and express the BAX protein. In contrast,
HCT116 BAX -/- cells have had the remaining BAX allele
knocked out by homologous recombination resulting in
complete loss of BAX protein expression, as confirmed
here in Figure 1A. The isogenic cell line pair express

similar levels of pro-apoptotic BAK and exhibit induction
of p53 and p21 expression to a similar extent in response
to 5Gy irradiation (Figure 1B).
HCT116 BAX -/- cells have been shown previously
to be resistant to apoptosis induced by the non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug sulindac sulfide, as determined
by fluorescence microscopy of DAPI-stained cells and
analysis of caspase-9 activation [11]. Interestingly,
we observed no significant difference in sensitivity to
sulindac sulfide between the two HCT116 isogenic cells
types when assessed by 96 hours SRB assay to measure
cell proliferation in the overall population (Figure
1C and Table 1; HCT116 BAX +/- 93.2μM ± 4.9 SEM,
HCT116 BAX -/- 109.2μM ± 8.5 SEM P > 0.05).
The lack of significant difference in sensitivity of
the overall tumor cell population to sulindac sulfide may
be due to the SRB assay being a measure of total cellular
protein (normally proportional to cell number remaining)
present after 96-hour drug exposure, and hence does not
distinguish between viable and nonviable cells or between
cytostasis and cell death. HCT116 cells which become
detached following 17-AAG treatment have previously
been demonstrated to be apoptotic using morphology,
sub-G1 distribution on flow cytometry and PARP cleavage
analysis [8]. Therefore, to confirm that BAX expression
influenced the apoptotic response to sulindac sulfide,
detached cells were harvested after 48 hours exposure
to 2.5xGI50 sulindac sulfide (as determined by 96 hours
SRB assay) and the cleavage status of poly-ADP ribose
polymerase (PARP) was analyzed by immunoblotting.
PARP is a highly expressed nuclear protein that is a
substrate for the apoptotic protease caspase-3 and PARP
cleavage is a marker of apoptosis. Intact PARP was
present in vehicle-treated control HCT116 BAX +/- cells
whereas only the 89kDa caspase-3 cleaved form was
detected in response to sulindac sulfide, consistent with
apoptosis (Figure 1D). In contrast, only 116kDa intact
PARP was detected in both vehicle and sulindac sulfide
treated HCT116 BAX -/- cells (Figure 1D).
Our results are consistent with published data
demonstrating that BAX expression is required for the
induction of apoptosis in response to sulindac sulfide
but also indicate that in HCT116 BAX -/- cells a decrease
in apoptotic response may not translate into increased
sensitivity overall when measured by conventional cell
proliferation assay [11].

sensitivity to sulindac sulphide or HSP90 inhibitors

HCT116 BAX +/- and BAX -/- cells were exposed to

radicicol or CCT18159 for 96 hours and inhibition of cell

assay was also used where stated. Concentration-response

As seen with sulindac sulfide, 96 hour SRB cell
proliferation assays with 17-AAG gave significantly
similar GI50 values for both members of the HCT116
isogenic cancer cell line pair (Figure 2A and Table 1;

17- AAG causes depletion of HSP90 client proteins CRAF
and CDK4 [12, 16, 19, 20]. This is accompanied by the
concurrent induction of HSP72, the inducible isoform of
the HSP70 family, indicative of the HSF1-mediated heat
shock response [12, 16, 19, 20]. Collectively, client protein
depletion and HSP72 induction comprise a molecular
biomarker signature of HSP90 inhibition that has been
validated further in clinical trials [21-23].
The expression levels of CRAF, CDK4 and HSP72
were analyzed by immunoblotting following 72 hours
exposure to 17-AAG (Figure 3). In both BAX +/- and
BAX -/- HCT116 cells CRAF was depleted and HSP72
induced in a concentration-dependent manner, the extent
of which was generally similar in both cell types (Figure
3). CDK4 depletion was less than with CRAF, but was
seen in both cell lines at 10 x GI50 17-AAG (Figure 3)

HCT116 BAX +/- 41.3nM ± 2.3 SEM, HCT116 BAX -/32.3nM ±1.3 SEM, P > 0.05). Because of the possible
discrepancy between measuring inhibition of cell
proliferation by SRB and cell death, as seen above for
sulindac sulfide, an MTT assay was also used. The MTT
assay is based on the reduction of a tetrazolium salt by
mitochondrial dehydrogenase [13]; therefore, it provides
an indication of the number of viable cells remaining after
96 hours exposure to 17-AAG (Figure 2B). Consistent
with the GI50 values determined for the isogenic pair
using the SRB assay, no significant difference in the
overall sensitivity to 17-AAG was observed by MTT
assay between the two cell types (Figure 2B and Table1;
HCT116 BAX +/- 45.2nM ± 7.9 SEM, HCT116 BAX -/41.8nM ± 4.1 SEM P > 0.05). We also determined the
sensitivity of the isogenic HCT116 cancer cell pair to the
HSP90 inhibitors radicicol and CCT18159 [12], which
are both chemically distinct from 17-AAG. Again, we
observed no difference in the sensitivity of the isogenic
cell line pair to these HSP90 inhibitors indicating that
this lack of differential effect is not restricted to the
benzoquinone ansamycin class of HSP90 inhibitors
(Table 1). Thus BAX knockout does not affect the overall
number of viable cells remaining 96 hours after HSP90
inhibition.

BAX knockout does not influence cell cycle
distribution in response to 17-AAG, but does
affect cell death
Although no significant difference was observed
in the sensitivity of HCT116 BAX +/- and BAX -/- cells
to 17-AAG using cell proliferation assays for the bulk
population, it was demonstrated earlier using sulindac
sulfide that these assays cannot be used to distinguish
between a cytostatic or apoptotic response (Figure 1). It
has previously been shown that parental HCT116 colon
cancer cells respond to 17-AAG predominantly through
a cytostatic mechanism [8, 20]. However, HCT116 cells
do not exhibit accumulation at any particular phase of
the cell cycle in response to 17-AAG [8]. Consistent
with this, cell cycle analysis of HCT116 BAX +/- and
BAX -/- cells showed no obvious accumulation within
the G1-S or G2-M phases of the cell cycle in response
to 72 hours exposure to increasing concentrations of
17-AAG (Figure 4A). However, sub-G1 populations were
clearly and reproducibly detected in HCT116 BAX +/- cells
at the higher concentrations of 17-AAG used (Figure
4A). In contrast, sub-G1 peaks were not detectable in
HCT116 BAX -/- cells at any concentrations of 17-AAG
investigated (Figure 4A). Sub-G1 peaks are characteristic
of apoptotic cells, which are recognized as hypodiploid
due to intra-nucleosomal degradation of DNA by
endonucleases during the later stages of apoptosis.
Therefore these data provided the first evidence to indicate
that apoptotic cell death may occur in HCT116 BAX +/but not isogenic BAX -/- cells in response to 17-AAG
treatment.
As previously mentioned, HCT116 cells which
become detached following treatment with 17-AAG
are apoptotic according to their morphology, sub-G1
distribution on flow cytometry and PARP cleavage status
[8]. Therefore, to further investigate the role of BAX in the
cell death response to 17-AAG, the number of detached

17-AAG treatment inhibits HSP90 function in
both BAX +/- and BAX -/- HCT116 cells
It was important to establish that there was
comparable inhibition of HSP90 in both members
of the isogenic HCT116 cancer cell pair. Numerous
studies have shown that inhibition of HSP90 activity by

cells were counted 72 hours after the start of continuous
exposure to 17-AAG (Figure 4B). We observed a
concentration-dependent increase in the number of
detached cells for both HCT116 BAX +/- and BAX -/- cancer
cell lines (Figure 4B). However, although a concentrationdependent increase in the number of detached cells
was seen in both members of the isogenic pair, the
quantitative cell detachment response was much greater in
HCT116 BAX +/- cells, which exhibited approximately
6.7 (± 1.5 SEM) and 7.6 (± 1.6 SEM) fold greater total
cell death compared to HCT116 BAX knockout cells
when treated with 5x and 10x GI50 17-AAG respectively
(P < 0.05; Figure 4B).
To investigate further whether the mechanism of

A

cell death in the detached cells was apoptotic, the cleavage
status of the apoptotic marker PARP was analyzed
(Figure 4C). Consistent with our previous observations
in parental HCT116 cells [8], HCT116 BAX +/- cells
that had become detached following treatment with 17AAG were confirmed as apoptotic by the detection of
PARP in the 85kDa caspase-3 cleaved form (Figure 4C).
Interestingly, although PARP cleavage was also found in
isogenic HCT116 BAX -/- cells, the cleavage pattern was
distinctly different from that associated with apoptosis
(Figure 4C). In HCT116 BAX -/- cells PARP was present as
three distinct bands corresponding to molecular weights
of 116kDa, 85kDa and 62kDa (Figure 4C). This pattern

Figure 4: BAX knockout decreases apoptosis and increases necrosis in HCT116 human colon cancer cells treated with
17-AAG. Exponentially growing HCT116 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of 17-AAG at multiples of the GI50 for the

individual cell types (HCT116 BAX +/- GI50 41.3nM ± 2.3 SEM, HCT116 BAX -/- 32.3nM ±1.3 SEM, as determined by 96 hours SRB assay)
or the equivalent volume of drug vehicle (DMSO). (A) BAX status alters the flow cytometry profile of HCT116 cells harvested 72 hours
after the start of treatment. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using propidium iodide staining. DNA Histograms are representative of
two independent experiments. The sub-G1 peaks in HCT116 BAX +/- cells indicate apoptosis which was not seen in HCT116 BAX -/- cells.
(B) BAX knockout reduces total cell death determined by quantifying the number of HCT116 BAX +/- and BAX -/- cells which became
detached after 72 hours exposure to 17-AAG, quantified using a hemocytometer, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01. Data presented as mean ± SEM,

that had become detached following 17-AAG or DMSO exposure using an N-terminal specific antibody (C-2-10). GADPH was included
as a loading control. Note that equal amounts of protein were loaded from the detached population in each case and hence the control
populations also had detectable cleaved PARP (apoptotic or necrotic) that represented the background level of cell death for these cell types.
(D) Morphological analysis confirms that BAX is required for apoptosis in response to 17-AAG treatment and necrosis occurs when BAX
is absent. HCT116 BAX +/- and BAX -/- cells which were growing exponentially were treated with 5xGI50 17-AAG for 72 hours. Detached
cells were harvested and their morphology analyzed using toluidine blue staining. Arrows indicate apoptotic (HCT116 BAX +/-) or necrotic
(HCT116 BAX -/-) characteristics. Images are representative of two independent experiments. Scale bar = 20µm

17-AAG induces caspase-3 dependent apoptosis
in vivo

for the N-terminal region of PARP, has previously been
reported to be representative of necrotic cell death during
which PARP is actively cleaved by lysosomal proteases
(cathepsins) rather than caspases [26].
The apoptotic versus necrotic cleavage
patterns of PARP observed in detached isogenic
HCT116 BAX +/- and BAX -/- cells respectively (Figure 4C)
were also observed in adherent cells following treatment
with 17-AAG (supplemental Figure S1). However,
the majority of PARP detected in the two adherent cell
populations was in the intact form (supplemental Figure
S1). This likely reflects a small population of apoptotic or
necrotic cells, respectively, in BAX +/- and BAX -/- cells that
are en route to detachment.
The predominant mechanisms of cell death induced
by 17-AAG in HCT116 BAX +/- and BAX -/- cells was
confirmed as apoptotic and necrotic respectively using
toluidine blue staining (Figure 4D). Consistent with
the PARP cleavage data described earlier (Figure 4C),
characteristics indicative of apoptosis, including chromatin
condensation [27, 28], were present in HCT116 BAX +/- but
not isogenic BAX -/- cells. In contrast, HCT116 BAX -/- cells
displayed cellular swelling and extensive cytoplasmic
vacuolization in response to 17-AAG treatment (Figure
4D), both of which are indicative of necrosis [28].

Next, we looked at the response of the isogenic

Following five daily i.p doses of 80mg/kg 17-AAG
to athymic mice bearing isogenic HCT116 BAX +/- or
HCT116 BAX -/- human colon cancer xenografts, a clear
effect on the growth of both tumor models was observed.
A quantitatively similar reduction was observed in the
mean tumor volume of both tumor xenografts (Figure

BAX +/- 49.7% ± 7.2 SEM, HCT116 BAX -/- 53.8% ± 9.7
SEM) was also demonstrated by the measurement of final
tumor weights at the end of the experiment (Figure 5B).
Immunoblot analysis of tumor samples
demonstrated that the isogenic status of the cell line pair
was conserved in vivo with only the HCT116 BAX +/- line
expressing BAX protein (Figure 5C). Consistent with
the in vitro characterization shown earlier, both types
of tumor expressed BAK (Figure 5C) and demonstrated
comparable depletion of the HSP90 client protein ERBB2

engagement in each member of the isogenic pair.
In line with the comparable effects on tumor growth
and final tumor weights, 17-AAG treatment caused
very similar decreases in the Ki67 staining for both
HCT116 BAX +/- and HCT116 BAX -/- xenografts as
determined on day five following daily i.p doses of
80mg/kg of the HSP90 inhibitor (Figure 6A and 6B). The
decrease in Ki67 proliferation index is indicative of a
marked antiproliferative effect of 17-AAG in both tumor
models.
In contrast, and entirely consistent with our
earlier in vitro findings, induction of apoptosis by
17-AAG was observed in HCT116 BAX +/- but not in
HCT116 BAX -/- tumor xenografts as measured by the
cleavage of caspase-3 on day five following daily i.p
doses of 80mg/kg 17-AAG (Figure 6C and 6D). An
approximate 4-fold induction of cells staining positive
for caspase-3 cleavage was observed in HCT116 BAX +/tumor xenografts, which was absent in isogenic HCT116
BAX -/- tumor xenografts (Figure 6C and 6D). Note,
however, that the overall proportion of apoptotic cells
remained low even in the treated tumors, increasing from

These results show that, in line with the in vitro
experiments, BAX knockout blocks the weak apoptotic
effect of 17-AAG in HCT116 colon cancer xenografts.
However, the overall inhibitory effects of 17-AAG on
bulk tumor growth were comparable in the BAX +/- and
BAX -/- HCT116 colon cancer models, indicating that
apoptosis induction is not limiting in the in vivo solid
tumor setting and that antiproliferative effects likely
dominate the therapeutic response.

DISCUSSION
Surprisingly given the depletion of multiple
oncogenic proteins and blockade of many signaling
pathways, it is well documented that HSP90 inhibition
causes predominantly a cytostatic antiproliferative effect
rather than cell death in various cancer cell lines [8, 20, 24,
25]. However, we previously demonstrated using a small
panel of four human colon cancer cell lines that 17-AAG
can also induce a degree of apoptotic cell death, the extent

of which is tumor cell line-dependent [8]. In that previous
study we observed that KM12 human colon carcinoma
cells did not undergo significant apoptosis in response
to 17-AAG [8]. Unlike the other colon cancer cell lines
studied, KM12 cells do not express detectable levels of
pro-apoptotic BAX [8]. Therefore, we hypothesized
that the apoptotic response to HSP90 inhibition may
be dependent on the expression of BAX. This was
investigated in the present study using an isogenic pair of
HCT116 human colon carcinoma cell lines that differed
only in the expression of BAX.
Our analysis of the cell death response to 17AAG revealed that HCT116 BAX +/- cells underwent
approximately 6- to 7-fold greater apoptotic cell death
than BAX -/- cells following exposure to pharmacologically
relevant concentrations of 17-AAG. Flow cytometry
analysis following 17-AAG treatment revealed the
presence of sub-G1 peaks in HCT116 BAX +/- cells which
were absent in isogenic BAX -/- cells. Sub-G1 peaks are
indicative of DNA fragmentation which is associated
with apoptotic cell death [29]. This apoptotic mode of
cell death was confirmed in HCT116 BAX +/- cells by the
detection of apoptotic morphology (i.e. condensed nuclei)
and caspase-3 dependent cleaved PARP. Neither of these
effects were detected in HCT116 BAX -/- cells following
treatment with 17-AAG.
As observed consistently in the literature [8, 12,
20], we show here that inhibition of HSP90 by 17-AAG
induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic molecular
chaperone HSP72, as part of the HSF1-mediated heat
shock response, together with degradation of several
anti-apoptotic HSP90 client proteins, including CRAF
and AKT [8, 12, 20]. Previous studies have demonstrated
that the increased expression of HSP72 can provide a
cytoprotective effect against the induction of apoptosis
by inhibiting the oligomerisation of APAF-1 [30],
activation of caspase-3 and -9 [30, 31] and antagonism
of the activity of AIF [32]. HSP72 is known to interact
with BAX to prevent its translocation from the cytoplasm
to the mitochondria following heat shock and exposure
to 17-AAG [33]. We and others have demonstrated that
induction of HSP72 reduces the apoptotic response to
17-AAG [20, 33, 34] and silencing HSP72 expression
sensitizes cells to the cell death effects of 17-AAG by
promoting translocation of BAX to the mitochondria
[33]. However, we show here that similar levels of
HSP72 were induced in response to 17-AAG in isogenic
HCT116 BAX +/- and BAX -/- cells. Therefore, it is unlikely
that HSP72 was involved in the differential apoptotic
response to 17-AAG observed between these two cell
types.
The HSP90 client CRAF may also exert an antiapoptotic role by its ability to modulate the activity of proapoptotic BAD [35]. Phosphorylation of BAD by CRAF
has been reported to decrease the pro-apoptotic activity
of this protein [35]. Thus the reduction of CRAF by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

17-AAG may contribute to induction of apoptosis
via reduced BCL2 activity. However, we show here
that CRAF expression is reduced to a similar extent
between HCT116 BAX +/- and BAX -/- cells in response to
17-AAG, indicating that the difference in BAX-mediated
apoptosis is not due to differential CRAF degradation.
Moreover, the similar depletion of CRAF and induction
of HSP72 following 17-AAG treatment provide evidence
of comparable HSP90 target engagement in the isogenic
HCT116 cell line pair.
Interestingly, although we showed that apoptotic
cell death in response to 17-AAG was blocked in the
isogenic BAX knockout cells and the overall level of
cell death was considerably reduced, we report here, to
our knowledge for the first time, that the lower level of
cell death that is observed in the BAX -/- cells occurs via
a necrotic mechanism. This interesting switch in cell
death mechanism was demonstrated by the presence of
cellular swelling, extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization
and detection of the necrotic signature of PARP cleavage
in response to 17-AAG treatment. The necrotic signature
includes a 62kDa fragment which has been shown to be
a consequence of PARP cleavage by lysosomal proteases
such as cathepsins, especially B and G [26]. These
enzymes are released from the lysosome during necrosis
allowing access to cytoplasmic or nuclear substrates [26].
Cleavage of PARP is considered to be a relatively early
event associated with necrotic cell death and has been
shown to occur before the widespread, non-specific DNA
degradation that is associated with the final stages of
necrosis [36].
Despite the block in apoptosis and greatly reduced
total cell death in the absence of BAX, we observed
that the overall in vitro sensitivity determined by SRB
or MTT assays was no different between BAX +/- and
BAX -/- HCT116 human colon cancer cells. The same lack
of differential overall effect was seen with the chemically
distinct HSP90 inhibitors radicicol and CCT18159 [12].
Similar to the above results measuring overall cell
proliferation by SRB or MTT assays in vitro, we saw no
difference in responsiveness to 17-AAG between BAX +/and BAX -/- HCT116 cells when grown in vivo as solid
tumor xenografts in immune-compromised mice, as
measured by tumor volume or final tumor weight. This
was despite a 4-fold induction of cleaved caspase-3
positive cells in BAX +/- HCT116 tumors, comparable to
the increase seen in vitro, and a lack of apoptosis in BAX -/HCT116 tumors, as also seen in cell culture. This suggests
that the in vivo response of the bulk tumor is likely
dictated by the drug-induced decrease in Ki67-positive
proliferative cells which was similar in BAX +/- and
BAX -/- HCT116 tumors. As seen before with the parental
HCT116 cells [8] 17-AAG did not cause accumulation
in any particular phase of the cell cycle in BAX +/- and
BAX -/- HCT116 cells. This suggests that the
antiproliferative effect is mediated by a general slowing
1970

of progression through the cell cycle in HCT116 cells.
Despite the clear differences in apoptosis induced
by 17-AAG between HCT116 BAX +/- and isogenic
BAX -/- cells, the proportion of apoptotic cells in
HCT116 BAX +/- cells after 17-AAG treatment remained
relatively small, accounting for only 3.6% of the total
population in vitro and 2.9% in vivo. We conclude that the
modest induction of apoptotic cell death observed in this
study and elsewhere [8] in response to 17-AAG is reliant
on BAX expression. However, the overall tumor response
to 17-AAG is dominated by the cytostatic antiproliferative
effect that is independent of BAX status.
It was not possible to determine if necrotic
cell death was contributing to the overall response of
HCT116 BAX -/- tumor xenografts. However, there is
increasing evidence suggesting that acute necrosis and
the subsequent antitumor immune response generated
could have clinical benefit in certain cancers [37, 38].
Unlike cells undergoing apoptosis, necrotic cells lose the
integrity of the plasma membrane leading to the release
of intracellular substrates that can stimulate fibroblasts
and macrophages [37, 38]. These substrates may also
act as maturation signals for dendritic cells, which can
cross-present antigens to cytotoxic T-cells leading to an
antitumor response [39]. An intrinsic limitation of using
athymic mice for xenograft studies is the inability to
determine the role of the adaptive immune response in the
antitumor effect of the drug. Further studies are required
to look at this.
During the finalization of the present paper, He
et al published complementary data to ours. They also
demonstrated that BAX is necessary for the apoptotic
response to 17-AAG in vitro but did not characterize the
effects of BAX knockout on the activation of alternative
cell death mechanisms or the effects of BAX in vivo. The
activation of BAX in response to 17-AAG was shown
to be via p53-dependant induction of PUMA, which is
upstream of BAX [40]. Knockout of PUMA in HCT116
tumor xenografts reduced the apoptotic and overall tumor
response to treatment with 17-DMAG, a water-soluble
analogue of 17-AAG [40]. PUMA is a proapoptotic
member of the BCL2 family that interacts with the
antiapoptotic members (BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL1, BCL-W)
to inhibit their interaction with BAX and BAK [41]. Our
own in vivo findings with BAX knockout suggest that
the difference in tumor response observed by He et al
may not solely be through the loss of PUMA-mediated
BAX activation, but potentially through the combined
loss of BAX and BAK activation coupled with the loss of
repressive activity against the antiapoptotic BCL2 family
members.
Our findings have significant clinical relevance,
especially because certain cancers, including colon and
gastric, are predisposed to loss of BAX expression owing
to frameshift mutations in both alleles of the BAX gene
as a result of failure of DNA mis-match repair systems
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and microsatellite instability [42]. This genotype is likely
selected for to reduce apoptosis during tumorigenesis.
Thus it was a concern that HSP90 inhibitors may not be
as effective in such patients. Our results suggest that this
will not be the case. However, evaluating patient response
in clinical trials of HSP90 inhibitors in relation to tumor
BAX status and also to the mechanism of antitumor
activity (apoptosis vs. necrosis) would be required to
truly determine the impact of the observations made in
this study on the role of BAX in the clinical response to
HSP90 inhibition.
Efforts to increase the anticancer effectiveness and
selective tumor cell killing by HSP90 inhibitors include
the use of drug combinations [2]. We recently reported
the potential for increasing the therapeutic effectiveness
of HSP90 inhibitors by decreasing survival signaling and
enhancing the apoptotic response in BAX +/- HCT116 colon
tumor xenografts by co-administration of TRAIL [43].
In conclusion, we demonstrate that BAX is a critical
requirement for the induction of apoptosis in a human
colon carcinoma model in response to 17-AAG. In the
absence of BAX the overall level of cell death is reduced.
Moreover, the lower level of cell death proceeds via a
necrotic rather than apoptotic mechanism. Interestingly,
overall bulk tumor response to 17-AAG is independent
of BAX status, both in vitro and in vivo, which is likely
due to the predominance of a cytostatic antiproliferative
response combined with the induction of an alternative
cell death mechanism when apoptosis is blocked. Our
results suggest that BAX status may not alter clinical
response to HSP90 inhibitors and indicate that additional
drugs may be required in combination to increase tumorselective cell killing by these clinically promising drugs,
such as combination with TRAIL [43] or HSP70 inhibitors
[20]. In addition, there are implications from our work for
the use of apoptotic endpoints in the assessment of the
activity of molecularly targeted agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
The isogenic human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines
HCT116 BAX +/- and HCT116 BAX -/- were a generous gift
from Professor Bert Volgelstein (Howard Hughes Medical
Institute, Baltimore, MD) and have been described
elsewhere [11]. HCT116 BAX +/- cells are heterozygous
for the BAX gene, but express BAX protein from the
remaining intact allele. HCT116 BAX -/- cells have had
the remaining intact BAX allele removed by homologous
recombination, and hence do not express any BAX
protein. Both cell types were cultured in DMEM (Sigma)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1x nonessential amino
acids and 5mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen) in a humidified

phase of growth were exposed to 17-AAG (Axxora) for 72
hours or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor sulindac sulphide
(Calbiochem) for 48 hours. Viability of cells was assessed
by trypan blue staining and counting on a hemocytometer.
BAX status was confirmed by immunoblotting

Pharmingen), PARP (Intact and cleaved forms, C-2-10,

peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or donkey antirabbit IgG (GE Healthcare) and Supersignal West Pico
Chemiluminecscent substrate (Thermo Scientific Pierce).

Radiation treatment

Tumor xenograft studies

Cells were exposed to radiation using a 60Co source
with a source-to-flask distance of 40cm3 and a dose rate
of 1.5Gy min-1

Procedures involving animals were approved by The
Institute of Cancer Research’s ethics committee and were
consistent with published guidelines [17]. Subcutaneous
xenografts of the HCT116 BAX +/- and HCT116 BAX -/human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines were established
bilaterally in the flanks of NCr athymic mice. When
tumors were of 5 to 6mm in mean diameter, mice were
treated with either vehicle (43% ethanol [200 proof], 33%
propylene glycol, 24% cremaphor) or 80 mg/kg once
daily 17-AAG on days 0-4, 7-11 and 14. Tumor growth
was monitored by caliper measurement. For biomarker
analysis, tumor samples were taken from a subset of mice
on day 5. Protein lysates were prepared as previously
described [18].

Cell growth inhibition
Cells were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates
(1.6 x 103 cells/well) and left to attach for 36 hours.
A range of concentrations of sulindac sulphide,
17-AAG, CCT18159 [12] or radicicol (Calbiochem)
were added to quadruplicate wells for an exposure period
of 96 hours. Cell growth inhibition was measured using
Sulforhodamine B (Sigma) and 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays as
previously described [12, 13].

Immunohistochemistry and quantitative image
analysis

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle distribution and sub-G1 populations
were analyzed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide
staining as previously described [8].

Formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded
(FFPE)
xenograft tumors were immunostained with Ki67
(MIB-1) monoclonal mouse antibody (Dako) at a
1:2000 dilution and cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175) rabbit
polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) at
a 1:200 dilution. Standard polymer and avidin–biotin–
peroxidase complex techniques were used respectively
for immunohistochemistry, which was carried out on 4-μm
sections of FFPE tissue. Heat antigen retrieval in citrate
buffer at pH 6.0 was applied. Negative controls were
included in every run. Slides were counterstained with
Harris hematoxylin. Slides stained for Ki67 and cleaved
caspase-3 were scanned with an Aperio ScanScope XT
(Aperio) using a 20x objective. Whole slide images were
analyzed with the Aperio nuclear IHC algorithm (Aperio).

Morphological analysis
Detached cells were harvested 72 hours after
treatment with 5xGI50 17-AAG, washed once in PBS
(BDH), fixed and embedded [14]. For light microscopy,
1.0 mm sections were cut, dried onto microscope slides,
stained with toluidine blue (TAAB Laboratories), and
viewed under a Leitz Diaplan microscope. Images were
recorded using a Leica DFC320 digital camera.

Immunoblotting

Statistical analysis

Cells were collected and lysed in cell lysis buffer
as previously reported [15]. Sample preparation was
also as described [16]. Equal amounts of protein and
SeeBlue®Plus2 molecular weight markers (Invitrogen)
were separated on 4-20% Novex® Tris-Glycine gels by
electrophoresis and electrotransfered to 0.2µm pore size
nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were
blocked with casein buffer [16] and incubated overnight
with primary antibodies against ERBB2 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), HSP72 (Enzo life sciences), BAX (BD
