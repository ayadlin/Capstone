ABSTRACT:
Transcriptional regulation of the Hedgehog (HH) signaling response is mediated by GLI
genes (GLI1, GLI2) downstream of SMO, that are also activated by oncogenic signaling
pathways. We have demonstrated the importance of targeting GLI downstream of SMO
in the induction of cell death in human colon carcinoma cells. In HT29 cells inhibition of
GLI1/GLI2 by the small molecule inhibitor GANT61 induced DNA double strand breaks
(DSBs) and activation of ATM, MDC1 and NBS1; γH2AX and MDC1, NBS1 and MDC1
co-localized in nuclear foci. Early activation of ATM was decreased by 24 hr, when
p-NBS1Ser343, activated by ATM, was significantly reduced in cell extracts. Bound γH2AX
was detected in isolated chromatin fractions or nuclei during DNA damage but not
during DNA repair. MDC1 was tightly bound to chromatin at 32 hr as cells accumulated
in early S-phase prior to becoming subG1, and during DNA repair. Limited binding of
NBS1 was detected at all times during DNA damage but was strongly bound during DNA
repair. Transient overexpression of NBS1 protected HT29 cells from GANT61-induced
cell death, while knockdown of H2AX by H2AXshRNA delayed DNA damage signaling.
Data demonstrate following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition: 1) induction of DNA damage in cells
that are also resistant to SMO inhibitors, 2) dynamic interactions between γH2AX,
MDC1 and NBS1 in single cell nuclei and in isolated chromatin fractions, 3) expression
and chromatin binding properties of key mediator proteins that mark DNA damage or
DNA repair, and 4) the importance of NBS1 in the DNA damage response mechanism.

INTRODUCTION

roles are critical in HH-dependent survival signaling while
their specific roles have been defined only partially [7].
GLI1-/- mice have no obvious phenotype [5], in contrast
to homozygous GLI2-/- mice which die at birth [6, 8],
indicating the critical role of cooperative GLI function in
gene regulation and survival.
Dysregulated canonical HH signaling is part of the
malignant phenotype of several types of human cancers.
Thus, amplification of GLI1 or GLI2, mutations in
PTCH or SMO, aberrant gene expression, or upregulated
expression of HH ligands, have been identified [1, 7].
Small molecule inhibitors of SMO upstream of GLI have
been investigated in preclinical models [9-15], and in the
treatment of various types of cancers in humans [14, 1618]. Those tumors sensitive to SMO inhibitors including
basal cell carcinoma [19, 20] and medulloblastoma [16,

Canonical HH signaling engages the transmembrane
receptor PTCH, the intermediary signaling molecule
SMO, and the transcriptional regulators of the HH
signaling response, GLI. In normal cellular processes,
regulation by HH is involved in embryogenesis, tissue
patterning, stem cell function, and differentiation [1, 2].
The GLI genes comprise a family of transcription factors
that transcriptionally regulate downstream targets in
HH-dependent survival. GLI2 appears to be the primary
activator of HH signaling, with GLI1 as a transcriptional
target of GLI2, which may amplify HH-induced, GLI2mediated transcription of GLI1 target genes [1, 3-5];
GLI1 and GLI2 induce transcription of overlapping and
distinct sets of target genes [1, 3-6], their cooperative

21] rely on canonical HH signaling for survival. In
other cancer types, SMO inhibitors have demonstrated
limited clinical activity (GDC-0449, IPI-926, LDE225;
reviewed in [14, 16]). Intrinsic resistance to these agents
is frequent [9, 14, 16-18, 22], and acquired resistance
to GDC-0449 following initial response by mutation of
SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma [23]. In colon
cancer, activation of the HH pathway progresses during
carcinogenesis and in metastatic disease [11, 24, 25],
and is activated in human colon carcinoma cell lines [26,
27] and xenograft models [11], by ligand-dependent and
ligand–independent mechanisms. Canonical HH signaling
is linked to genomic instability involving inactivation
of DNA repair mechanisms, defects in checkpoint
activation, and predisposition to development of cancers
[28-30]. Chromosome instability is a hallmark of colon
cancer, resulting primarily from deregulation of the DNA
replication and mitotic spindle checkpoints (reviewed in
[31]). We have demonstrated that HH signaling is a critical
determinant of cell survival in colon cancer following
inhibition of the pathway at the level of the GLI genes
downstream of SMO [26, 27, 32, 33]. Non-canonical,

oncogene-driven signaling pathways, including activation
of the RAS/RAF pathway by genetic mutations in colon
cancer, converge on the activation of GLI genes and
their downstream targets [7, 22, 34, 35]. Reduced GLI
activity in response to the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling
inhibitor U0126 [36, 37] was demonstrated in HT29 cells
[33] (mutated B-RAF V600E [38]). This emphasizes that
switching off the GLI genes downstream of SMO, that
determines HH-dependent transcriptional gene regulation,
is critical in terminating HH-dependent survival in cancer
cells.
In contrast to SMO, few agents are available that
can specifically probe the role of GLI in cell survival.
GANT61 was identified in a cell-based screen for small
molecule inhibitors of GLI1-mediated transcription. In
the original study [39], GANT61 abrogated GLI function
in the nucleus, blocked both GLI1- and GLI2- mediated
transcription, and inhibited GLI1-DNA binding. We
further demonstrated [32] the specificity of GANT61
for GLI1 and GLI2, rapid inhibition of GLI binding to
target gene promoters in ChIP analyses, reduced GLIluciferase activity, and inhibition of transcriptional

A third member of the GLI family, GLI3, is expressed
as a cleaved C-terminally truncated form (GLI3R) that
silences HH-GLI targets in developmental regulation and
embryogenesis [11, 40]. Transient expression of GLI3R
repressed GLI1 and GLI2 transcriptional activity in colon

cancer cell lines, paralleling the effects of GANT61 [32,
33]. GLI3R transfection not only reduced expression and
switched off the function of GLI1 and GLI2, but also
induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) marked by
H2AX nuclear foci, and induced cell death [32]. Following
the induction of DNA damage, colon cancer cells

accumulated in early S-phase without further progression
before becoming subG1 [27]. cDNA microarray gene
profiling demonstrated reduced expression of genes
engaged in DNA replication, DNA damage signaling, and
DNA repair at the G1/S interface [26].
In response to DNA damage, DSBs activate ATMdependent phosphorylation of H2AX, MDC1, and NBS1.
ATM phosphorylates the carboxy-terminal tail of histone
H2AX in the vicinity of the break [41,42,43]. This
chromatin modification is crucial for the relocalization
of proteins to sites flanking DSBs, and generates foci
required to promote efficient repair and sustained DNA
damage signaling [44, 45]. MDC1 colocalizes with
γH2AX by direct interaction between the C-terminal
twin BRCT domains of MDC1 and the γH2AX phosphoepitope [46, 47]. MDC1 also recruits mediators of DNA
repair including NBS1 to DNA double strand break
sites, and is crucial in nuclear foci to promote sustained
DNA damage signaling and repair [41, 46-49]. NBS1
activity in early S-phase is critical for regulation of DNA
replication, activation of the intra-S-phase checkpoint,
and repair of DNA DSBs [49-56]. NBS1 functions in
the evolutionarily conserved MRN (MRE11-RAD50NBS1) complex in signaling of DSBs within chromatin,
in activity at replication forks, and in DNA repair [55-57].
In response to DNA damage, MRN regulates the activity
of ATM by direct binding to NBS1 through a C-terminal
motif, recruiting ATM to the vicinity of DNA DSBs and

stimulating ATM activation [55, 57]. ATM-dependent
phosphorylation of NBS1, which occurs at Ser343, is
then necessary for activation of the MRN complex,
localization of MRN to the nucleus, and for recruitment
to DNA break sites for repair of damaged DNA [49, 55,
57]. MRE11, which binds at the C-terminus of NBS1, also
binds to DNA and provides endonucleolytic activities for
DNA processing [57-59]. The MDC1-NBS1 interaction
is crucial for the targeting and retention of NBS1 on
chromatin flanking DNA DSBs. Following DNA damage
signaling, the recognition and processing of DNA damage
occur at the onset of S-phase [32, 60].
Using GANT61, cyclopamine and GDC-0449
we have demonstrated the importance of targeting GLI
downstream of SMO in termination of HH survival
signaling that leads to the induction of cell death in
human colon carcinoma cells. Data demonstrate that
colon cancer cells resistant to cyclopamine or GDC-0449
remain sensitive to GANT61. Inhibition of GLI1/GLI2
by the small molecule inhibitor GANT61 induces DNA
DSBs marked by γH2AX nuclear foci, an ATM-dependent
DNA damage signaling mechanism, and activation of
MDC1 and NBS1. We have developed a model of DNA
damage and DNA repair using GANT61 and explored the
mechanisms downstream of GLI1/GLI2 inhibition. Using
this model, we have identified the dynamic interactions
of the DSB signaling components γH2AX, MDC1 and
NBS1 at the level of chromatin in DNA damage signaling

respectively, at 5-fold higher, supra-physiologic drug
concentrations (100 µM). Both HT29 and GC3/c1 cells
resistant to SMO inhibitors maintained the high degree of
sensitivity to GANT61 (20 µM; Figure 1B). Further, HT29
cells stably overexpressing GLI1 or GLI2 demonstrated
reduced sensitivity to GANT61 at all concentrations up to
20 µM examined (Figure 1C).

RESULTS

NBS1 co-localizes with MDC1 and not γH2AX in
nuclear foci; p-NBS1Ser343 is lost from cell extracts
following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition:

Switching off HH signaling at the level of GLI
induces extensive cell death in contrast to
targeting SMO upstream of GLI:

HT29 cells were treated for 4 hr or 24 hr with
GANT61 (20 µM). Cells were analyzed by confocal
microscopy to determine the subcellular localization
of γH2AX, MDC1 and NBS1 in cells and in nuclear
foci during the induction of early DNA damage at 4
hr [33], and at the G1/S boundary at 24 hr when cells
were accumulating in early S [26, 32, 33] (Figure 2A).
Alternatively, cells were harvested for western analysis
(Figure 2B). Examination at the single cell level revealed
γH2AX nuclear foci at 4 hr after GANT61 exposure that
were increased in intensity and frequency at 24 hr. MDC1
nuclear foci were also detected at 4 hr and 24 hr following
GANT61 and co-localized with γH2AX. In contrast,
NBS1 nuclear foci did not co-localize with γH2AX,

HT29, HCT116, SW480, GC3/c1 and VRC5/c1 cells
were exposed to GANT61 (GLI antagonist), the classic
SMO antagonist cyclopamine, or the clinically used

efficacies compared at equimolar drug concentrations (20
µM; Figure 1A). Minimal cell death (< 35%) determined
by Annexin V/PI staining followed by flow cytometry
was obtained in the presence of both SMO antagonists. In
marked contrast, GANT61-induced GLI inhibition caused
> 85% cell death in all cell lines. To further determine
the importance of HH signaling regulation at the level of
GLI in cell survival, HT29 or GC3/c1 cells were selected

Expression of DNA damage signaling molecules
during DNA damage and DNA repair:
Expression of p-ATM and total ATM, γH2AX,
p-MDC1, total MDC1, p-NBS1Ser343, total NBS1 and
MRE11, was examined during DNA damage or during
DNA repair in HT29 cells following GANT61 exposure
(20 µM). Protein expression was examined for up to 40
hr of continuous exposure to GANT61 (DNA damage), or
alternatively following 24 hr GANT61 exposure with a 16
hr washout to allow cells to undergo DNA repair (Figure
4A). Total ATM was expressed at each time point, being
more prominent at 24 hr following GANT61 treatment.
p-ATM was maintained at the level observed at 24 hr, for
up to 40 hr examined. γH2AX, marking DNA DSBs, was
expressed for up to 40 hr, being most prominent at 24 hr
and 40 hr, however expression in cell extracts disappeared
by 16 hr following removal of GANT61. p-MDC1 was
detected in cell extracts during the period of DNA damage
induced by continuous GANT61 exposure, and expression

Model of DNA damage and DNA repair:
To elucidate the mechanisms that influence DNA
damage or DNA repair following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition, a
model was established in HT29 cells following GANT61
treatment. HT29 cells continuously exposed to GANT61
(20 µM) for ≥ 48 hr undergo DNA damage upstream of
cell death (Figure 3). However cells exposed to GANT61
for 24 hr that induces DNA damage can be rescued by
placing in drug-free medium, following which time DNA
is repaired (Figure 3A). When GANT61 (20 µM) exposure
is increased from 24 hr to 32 hr, the ability to fully rescue
from GANT61-induced cell death is lost (Figure 3B).

expression of total MDC1 remained relatively constant
throughout the experiment. Total NBS1 was present in
cell extracts during DNA damage and during DNA repair,
however p-NBS1Ser343 was undetectable after 24 hr during

GANT61 was removed at 24 hr, chromatin-bound γH2AX
was significantly decreased at 8 hr, and was almost
undetectable bound to chromatin at 16 hr during repair
of DNA DSBs. MDC1, critical for retention of NBS1 at
the sites of DNA breaks, was highly expressed at 32 hr
during the DNA damage response (when cells are arrested
in early S [32]) and again during DNA repair, 16 hr after
GANT61 was removed from cells. In contrast, NBS1 was
only weakly detected bound to chromatin between 24 hr
and 48 hr during DNA damage, and was highly chromatin
bound during DNA repair (Figure 4B). It should be
noted that between 24 hr and 40 hr, p-NBS1Ser343 was not
expressed in cell extracts, but was re-expressed during
DNA repair (Figure 4A).

Binding of DNA damage signaling molecules to
chromatin during DNA damage and DNA repair:
Chromatin was isolated from GANT61-treated
(20 µM) HT29 cells for up to 48 hr during continuous
exposure, or at 8 hr and 16 hr following washout after 24
hr exposure (DNA repair; Figure 4B). ATM was tightly
bound to chromatin at 24 hr during GANT61 exposure
but was decreased at 32 hr and absent from chromatin at
40 hr. ATM was bound to chromatin during DNA repair,
16 hr after GANT61 was removed from cells. γH2AX
was highly expressed at all times during the DNA damage

continuous exposure to GANT61 (20 µM) and for up to 24
hr following removal of drug after a 24 hr exposure (DNA
repair). MDC1 nuclear foci were detected in untreated cells
in contrast to γH2AX foci which were significantly less
frequent (Figure 5A). Both MDC1 and γH2AX foci were
co-localized in nuclei at all times during DNA damage.
MDC1 nuclear foci were expressed during DNA repair,
correlating with the high degree of binding to chromatin.
In contrast, γH2AX nuclear foci rapidly disappeared from
nuclei during DNA repair (Figure 5B), which correlates
with the disappearance of γH2AX from the chromatin
fraction during DNA repair. Co-localization of MDC1 and
NBS1 nuclear foci was determined at all times for up to
48 hr during continuous exposure to GANT61 (20 µM;
Figure 6A). During DNA repair, MDC1 and NBS1 nuclear
foci were also highly abundant and superimposed, at the
same time that γH2AX foci were disappearing from nuclei
and from isolated chromatin (Figure 6B).

inhibition that led to cell death. Conversely, re-expression
of p-NBS1Ser343 in cell extracts and avid binding of NBS1
to chromatin during DNA repair correlated with rescue
from GANT61-induced cell death. To elucidate the role
of NBS1 in regulating the outcome of cellular survival
downstream of GLI1/GLI2 inhibition, HT29 cells
transiently transfected with pQCXIH-NBS1 or mock
transfected with vector alone (pQCXIH) for 24 hr, were
treated for a subsequent 48 hr with GANT61 at varied
concentrations from 5-20 µM. The influence of NBS1
overexpression on GANT61-induced cell death was
determined by Annexin V/PI staining and FACS analysis
(Figure 7A). Cell death was inhibited by 30% at the highest
concentration of GANT61 examined, demonstrating the
critical role of NBS1 in the DNA damage response that
regulates cell death following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition. In
addition to total NBS1 overexpression, the expression
of the active form of NBS1, p-NBS1Ser343, was also
significantly increased (Figure 7A). We also demonstrated
that the nucleosides adenosine, guanosine, cytidine and
thymidine administered simultaneously at concentrations
of 20 µM, afforded partial protection of HT29 cells from
GANT61-induced cell death [27]. Nucleoside rescue from
cell death following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition was determined
to be ≈ 30% (Figure 7B), similar to the protection afforded

A. In transient transfections, HT29 cells were transfected with the retroviral vector pQCXIH alone, or pQCXIH-NBS1 for 24 hr prior to
treatment for 48 hr with GANT61 at concentrations of 0 µM, 5 µM, 10 µM, or 20 µM. Cell death was determined. Inset: Total NBS1 and

following transient transfection and overexpression
of NBS1. To determine the role of γH2AX in cell fate
following inhibition of GLI1/GLI2 by GANT61, HT29
cells stably expressing H2AXshRNA or scrambled shRNA
(ScrshRNA) were treated for 48 hr with GANT61 at doses
of 5 µM, 10 µM or 20 µM, and the effect on induction of
cell death determined by Annexin V/PI staining and FACS
analysis (Figure 7C). Knockdown of H2AX, confirmed
by western analysis (Figure 7C Inset) protected cells from
GANT61-induced cell death by ≈ 25% at 48 hr. γH2AX
expression after GANT61 treatment was further examined
by western analysis following suppression of H2AX
expression using H2AXshRNA. γH2AX expression was
present in cells transduced with the vector control at 1 hr
and 4 hr following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition, but not in cells
transduced with H2AXshRNA. Under both conditions
γH2AX expression was present at 24 hr. H2AXshRNA
transduction and reduction in γH2AX expression therefore
appeared to delay the detection and recognition of
DNA damage following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition. This is
consistent with reduced γH2AX binding to chromatin and
decreased nuclear γH2AX foci under conditions of cell
rescue following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition, and reduction in
cell death.

the current study, we selected human colon carcinoma cell
lines for resistance to supra-physiological concentrations
of cyclopamine or GDC-0449 (100 µM), and examined
sensitivity of the resistant cell populations to GANT61
(20 µM). Under both conditions, cells maintained high
degree of sensitivity to the inhibitor of GLI1/GLI2.
Further, HT29 cells engineered to overexpress GLI1 or
GLI2 demonstrated reduced sensitivity to GANT61.
Collectively, data demonstrate the critical importance of
the GLI genes in driving cellular survival in colon cancer
cells, and that GLI genes may be activated by liganddependent and ligand-independent mechanisms.
Termination of HH signaling at the level of
GLI targeted either by pharmacologic or genetic
downregulation induces DNA damage [26, 27, 32, 33],
which is recognized in early S-phase [26, 32, 60], and
marked by γH2AX nuclear foci. DNA replication is
inhibited in GANT61-treated cells following GLI1/GLI2
inhibition, where genes including thymidylate synthase,
thymidine kinase, topoisomerase2, E2F and DNA
polymerases are downregulated in expression [26]. The
intra-S-phase checkpoint is activated by DNA DSBs and
requires ATM [60]. This checkpoint inhibits progression
through S-phase, initiation of late origins of replication
[61, 62], and stabilizes stalled replication forks [63].
GANT61-treated cells undergo intra-S-phase checkpoint
activation at 24 hr, characterized by phosphorylation of
Cdc25A on Ser123 (which targets this phosphatase for
proteasomal degradation), activation of Cdk2 is inhibited
(decreased Tyr15p-Cdk2), and cyclin E accumulates [32, 33].
We have previously reported accumulation of HT29 cells
in early S following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition and activation
of an intra-S-phase checkpoint that cannot be sustained,
with cells becoming subG1 without further progression
through S-phase [32, 33]. In the current study we have
identified the molecular interactions between the different
signaling molecules involved in DNA damage subsequent
to inhibition of GLI1/GLI2 function.
In response to DNA damage, an evolutionarily
conserved MRN complex (MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1)
regulates the activity of ATM by direct binding of ATM
to NBS1, thereby recruiting ATM to the vicinity of DNA
DSBs and stimulating ATM activation [55, 57]. NBS1
functions in an evolutionarily conserved complex with
MRE11 and RAD50 (MRN) in several cellular contexts
including the repair of DNA DSBs (non-homologous end
joining, homologous recombination), recognition and
signaling of DSBs within chromatin, activity at replication
forks [55-57], and is active in early S-phase but not in
mid or late S-phase [49-52,53-56]. NBS1 is essential
for activation of the intra-S-phase checkpoint in early S
to allow repair of DNA damage [54, 56, 57]. In response
to DNA damage, MRN regulates the activity of ATM by
direct binding of ATM to NBS1, thereby recruiting ATM to
the vicinity of DNA DSBs and stimulating ATM activation
[55, 57]. ATM-dependent phosphorylation of NBS1

DISCUSSION
In this study or previously, we have demonstrated
that targeting SMO upstream of GLI using the classic
SMO inhibitor cyclopamine [27, 33] (employed
extensively in preclinical studies), or the clinically used
agent GDC-0449, induces minimal cytotoxicity against
cell line models of human colon carcinoma exposed
at pharmacologically relevant drug concentrations. In
contrast, targeting GLI downstream of SMO using the
small molecule inhibitor GANT61, which targets both
GLI1 and GLI2 transcription, induces extensive cell death
in all of these cell line models at equimolar concentrations
[27, 33]. Similarly, genetic inhibition of GLI1 and GLI2
using the GLI3 repressor, GLI3R, induces DNA damage,
γH2AX expression and nuclear foci, cleavage of caspase-3
and PARP, and cell death, paralleling the effects obtained
from pharmacologic targeting of GLI1 and GLI2 [32, 33].
Variable activity of SMO inhibitors has been demonstrated
in preclinical models [9-15] and clinically [14, 16-21],
in a variety of different types of human cancers. This is
due to the predominant dependence of certain types of
human cancers on canonical HH signaling (sensitivity;
basal cell carcinoma [19, 20], medulloblastoma [16, 21]),
or alternatively circumvention of SMO as a therapeutic
target in preclinical models and clinically (intrinsic
resistance [9, 14, 16-18, 22]) due to activation of GLI by
alternate non-canonical, oncogenic signaling pathways
[7, 22, 27, 33-35]. In addition, tumors that are initially
sensitive to GDC-0449 can develop acquired resistance
to SMO inhibitors following prolonged exposure [23]. In

at Ser343 is then necessary for activation of the MRN
complex and for the recruitment of MRN to DNA break
sites for repair of damaged DNA[49, 55]. MRN imparts
three key functions: 1) DNA binding and processing,
2) DNA tethering to bridge DNA over short and long
distances, and 3) activation of the DSB response and
checkpoint signaling. NBS1 is essential for localization
of MRN to the nucleus and for binding to DNA [57].
MRE11, which binds at the C-terminus of NBS1, and
also binds to DNA, provides endonucleolytic activities
for DNA processing [57-59]. Finally, RAD50 provides
regulatory ATPase and adenlyate kinase activities [57].
NBS1 functions in regulation of MRN activity, where
the endogenous concentration of active, phosphorylated
NBS1 is a critical regulatory factor [49, 64-67]. Our data
demonstrate that upon blocking GLI1/GLI2 activity, DNA
damage is induced during which the steady state level
of p-NBS1Ser343 is significantly reduced by 24 hr posttreatment, concurrent with reduced chromatin-associated
NBS1 levels. These observations suggest limited NBS1mediated DNA repair events following GANT61-mediated
termination of GLI1/GLI2 function. In response to
DNA damage, DSBs activate ATM to phosphorylate the
carboxy-terminal tail of histone H2AX in the vicinity of
the break [41], a well recognized marker of DNA DSBs
[42, 43]. This chromatin modification is crucial for the
relocalization of several proteins to sites flanking DSBs,
generating foci that are required to promote efficient repair
and sustained DNA damage signaling. MDC1 co-localizes
with γH2AX [46, 47], and recruits additional mediators
of DNA repair including the MRN complex [48, 49].
Although early reports suggested that the N-terminal
FHA-BRCT domains of NBS1 enabled phosphorylationdependent interaction with γH2AX to retain NBS1 at the
sites of DSBs, it now appears that the retention of NBS1
is mediated by binding through a specific region of MDC1
(at residues 219-455) that contains six SDTDXD/E (STD)
clusters, and which are constitutively phosphorylated by
CK2 in unperturbed cells [47, 56, 68-70]. This MDC1NBS1 interaction via a phospho-dependent mechanism
appears crucial for the targeting and retention of NBS1 on
chromatin flanking DNA DSBs, and occurs in GANT61induced chromatin modifications, as we have demonstrated
by confocal microscopy in human colon carcinoma cells.
Thus, NBS1 co-localized in nuclear foci with MDC1 but
not γH2AX, and γH2AX co-localized with MDC1 to
facilitate DNA damage signaling. It is evident that γH2AX
and p-MDC1 were activated during DNA damage, while
p-NBS1Ser343 was significantly decreased in cell extracts
by 24 hr, in parallel with decreased availability of p-ATM.
We developed a model of DNA damage and DNA
repair, where specific mechanisms could be determined in
the same model system following GLI1/GLI2 inhibition
with GANT61. HT29 cells under continuous GANT61
(20 µM) exposure for 48 hr undergo DNA damage that
leads to cell death; cells exposed to GANT61 for 24 hr but
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

not 32 hr were rescued by placing in drug-free medium,
during which time they repaired damaged DNA. By 32
hr of continuous GANT61 exposure, cells had arrested
in early S but could not progress [26, 32]. γH2AX and
p-MDC1 were expressed during continuous GANT61 (20
µM) treatment. During DNA repair, γH2AX expression
was significantly reduced, while p-MDC1 expression
was increased. Total NBS1 and MRE11 were expressed
in GANT61-treated cells during both DNA damage
and DNA repair. In contrast, p-NBS1Ser343 expression
was significantly reduced at ≥ 24 hr during continuous
GANT61 exposure, along with lower levels of p-ATM (in
comparison to the enhanced activation at 4 hr [32]), but
was re-expressed during DNA repair. Upon examination
of isolated chromatin fractions from GANT61-treated
cells, ATM was highly bound in chromatin fractions at 24
hr during continuous exposure but not at later times, and
at 16 hr during DNA repair. γH2AX was tightly bound
to chromatin during DNA damage, and released during
DNA repair. MRE11 was strongly bound to chromatin
during DNA damage and during DNA repair. MDC1 was
strongly bound to chromatin during the period following
GLI1/GLI2 inhibition when cells were accumulated in
early S-phase (24 hr, 32 hr [32]), and also during DNA
repair when the presence of γH2AX in chromatin fractions
was significantly decreased. However NBS1 binding
was limited when cells were undergoing DNA damage,
paralleling the loss of p-NBS1Ser343 from cell extracts, and
became strongly bound during DNA repair. The findings
obtained for γH2AX, MDC1 and NBS1 were confirmed in
single cells by confocal microscopy. Thus, co-localization
of γH2AX and MDC1, MDC1 and NBS1, disappearance
of γH2AX as DNA DSBs were repaired after removal
of GANT61, with maintenance of NBS1 and MDC1 colocalization, were determined in nuclear foci. Data suggest
that p-NBS1Ser343 required for appropriate intra-S-phase
checkpoint formation and sustained activation may be
limiting in the processing of DNA damage signaling at the
intra-S-phase checkpoint upstream of cell death, following
GLI1/GLI2 inhibition.
To further test this hypothesis, HT29 cells were
transiently transfected with pQCXIH-NBS1 for 24 hr prior
to treatment with varied concentrations of GANT61 (5
µM, 10 µM, 20 µM) for 48 hr. Overexpression of NBS1
and its activated form, p-NBSSer343, significantly inhibited
GANT61-induced cell death, confirming the critical
role of NBS1 in regulating the DNA damage response
downstream of GLI1/GLI2 inhibition. This was similar to
the protection from DNA damage afforded by nucleosides
that rescued cells from GANT61-induced cell death,
when DNA replication and key regulatory genes were
downregulated [26, 32]. To determine the contribution
of γH2AX to DNA damage signaling upstream of cell
death, HT29 cells stably expressing H2AXshRNA were
treated with varied concentrations of GANT61 for 48 hr.
Partial decrease in cell death was determined under these

conditions, and γH2AX expression was decreased within
the first few hours of GANT61 treatment, but was restored
at 24 hr. These data together with data derived by western
analysis and confocal microscopy suggest that the primary
function of γH2AX is in the recognition of DNA DSBs
and in DNA damage signaling, and that suppression of
H2AX expression causes delay in the recognition of DNA
damage.
In summary we have demonstrated that the
processing of DNA damage following inhibition of HH
signaling at the level of GLI provides a specific rank order
of activation of ATM and downstream target genes that
recognize DNA damage in early S-phase. The activation
of a transient intra-S-phase checkpoint is characterized
by limited availability of p-NBS1Ser343 in cell extracts
and limited binding of NBS1 to chromatin via MDC1
during the critical phase at which colon carcinoma
cells accumulate in early S-phase and attempt to repair
damaged DNA. Phosphorylated NBS1 reappears in cell
extracts during DNA repair and NBS1 is strongly bound to
chromatin via MDC1. The function of γH2AX appears to
be predominantly in the recognition of DNA damage, and
in recruitment of MDC1 to sites of DNA breaks marked
by H2AX. It is evident that when MDC1 is recruited to
γH2AX DNA break sites, this mediator protein remains
bound to chromatin, as does NBS1, while γH2AX
disappears from chromatin when DSBs are repaired. It is
evident that the drivers of HH signaling, the GLI genes,
are critical to the survival of human colon carcinoma cells,
and that DNA damage signaling downstream of GLI1/
GLI2 inhibition is a critical regulator of cell death.

cells were obtained from ATCC. GC3/c1 and VRC5/
c1 cells were established in our laboratories from a
human colon adenocarcinoma xenograft model [71].
Cell lines were routinely verified by morphology, growth
characteristics, and response to cytotoxic agents (Annexin
V/propidium iodide (PI) staining). cDNA microarray
gene profiles were also characteristic. Cell lines were
verified biannually to be mycoplasma-free. Cells were
routinely maintained in the presence of folate-free RPMI
1640 medium containing 10% dFBS and 80 nM [6RS]5methyltetrahydrofolate. Full length GLI1 and GLI2 delta
N (N-terminus deleted constitutively active mutant; hereon
referred to as GLI2) in pBabe-Puro vector were a kind
gift from Dr. Graham W. Neill (Barts and The London
School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University
of London). pQCXIH-NBS1 was a kind gift from Dr.
Stephen P. Jackson (Cambridge, England). H2AXshRNA
and scrambledshRNA in the pGFP-V-RS vector were
obtained from Origene (Rockville, MD). GLI1cDNA,
GLI2cDNA, H2AXshRNA and ScrshRNA were
subcloned into pBabepuro. HT29 cells stably expressing
each construct were generated in the presence of a
selection antibiotic, puromycin (1 µg/ml) for 2 weeks, and
gene expression confirmed. HT29 cells were transiently
transfected with pQCXIH-NBS1 or vector control using
lipofectamine-2000 following the manufacturer’s protocol.
At 24 hr post-transfection, cells were treated with varied
concentrations of GANT61 (5µM, 10µM, 20µM) for 48
hr. Cell death was determined by Annexin V/PI staining
followed by flow cytometry.

Annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometric
analysis:

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometric analysis
was performed as described previously [27, 33]. Briefly,
cells were treated, in duplicate, as described in the figure
legends, after which they were collected by trypsinization
and incubated with Annexin V FITC (BD Biosciences)
and PI (Sigma) prior to analysis using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer. Raw data were analyzed using CellQuest
software.

Antibodies and Chemicals:
GANT61 was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals
(Farmingdale, NY), cyclopamine from Toronto Research
Chemicals (Toronto, ON), and GDC-0449 from JS
Research (Boston, MA). Drugs were dissolved in DMSO
(0.2%) and stored at -20oC. Antibodies: Anti-NBS1, antiγH2AX and anti-Mre11 monoclonal primary antibodies
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA). Anti-MDC1 polyclonal antibody and anti-pNBS1Ser343 and p-MDC1 monoclonal antibodies were
obtained from Abcam Ltd (Cambridge, MA). Peroxidase–
conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary
antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA).

Western blot analysis:
Total cellular lysates were prepared using modified
RIPA lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA). Total protein (54 µg) from cell lysates was loaded
and resolved on 10% or 5% SDS-PAGE gels, dependent on
protein size. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes, blocked (5% nonfat dry milk; 1 hr),
washed and incubated with primary antibody overnight at
4oC, and with secondary antibody for 1 hr and prior to
development.

HT29 human colon carcinoma cells either mocktreated or treated with GANT61 (20 µM) for varying time
periods, washed x 2 with ice-cold 1x PBS, and collected
as described [72]. Cell pellets (≈ 2 x 106 cells) were
resuspended in 200 µl extraction buffer (50 mM Hepes,
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, supplemented with
0.1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture tablets
[Roche Diagnostics] and phosphatase inhibitors [10
mM NaF, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 1 mM cantharidin]; Sigma) for 15 min
on ice for the first extraction. Cells were subsequently
centrifuged at 14,000 x g, 3 min, followed by a second
extraction on ice for 15 min with 200 µl of fresh extraction
buffer. The extract was centrifuged at 14,000 x g, 3 min,
4oC. The supernatant was pooled with that from the first
extraction. The pellet was further incubated in 200 µl of
extraction buffer without Triton and supplemented with
200 µg/ml RNase A (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min
at 25oC with agitation. Following centrifugation for 3 min
at 14 000 x g, the insoluble pellet was resuspended in 1x
PBS containing 1% SDS and heated for 10 min at 100oC.
Samples were sonicated for 10 sec and denaturing loading
buffer (60mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 10% SDS,
0.6M DTT, 0.012% bromophenol blue) was added to make
a 1 x final concentration. Samples were boiled for 5 min
and equal sample volumes of each fraction obtained from
equivalent numbers of cells were applied to SDS/PAGE
for western blotting.

Cells were plated at a density of 50,000/well
in 6-well plates on coverslips and allowed to attach
overnight. The following day, media was removed and the
cells were treated in the absence or presence of GANT61
(20μM) for various times with or without drug washout
after 24 hr. The coverslips were removed and placed in
a humidity chamber for fixation, permeabilization and
staining. Images were collected using an HCX Pl Apo
63X, 1.4NA oil immersion objective with Zoom 2 on a
Leica SP2 confocal microscope with spectrophotometric
detection (Leica Microsystems, GmbH, Wetzlar,
Germany). Four-color image acquisition was performed
and analysis of images was conducted using Image-Pro
Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda, MD).
