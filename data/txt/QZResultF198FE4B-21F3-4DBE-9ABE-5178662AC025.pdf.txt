ABSTRACT
Background: Warfarin is the most prescribed oral anticoagulant used for
preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Time in the therapeutic range
(TTR) has been accepted as the best method to evaluate the quality of warfarin
therapy. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of variables
on the time in the therapeutic range for warfarin therapy in patients with atrial
fibrillation from a referral cardiovascular hospital.
Methods: This retrospective study included 443 patients were included (190
patients with age < 65 years and 253 patients with age ≥65 years) from 2011 to 2014
and TTR was computed according to Rosendaal’s method.
Results: Patients with age ≥65 years had higher TTR value (67±22%) compared
with patients with < 65 years (60±24%) (p = 0.004). In a linear regression model,
only age ≥65 years emerged as a significant predictor of greater TTR values. In
multivariate logistic regression model, the variable age ≥65 years was associated
with higher OR for having a TTR higher than the median value (OR = 2.17, p < 0.001).
Conclusion: We suggest that the age influenced TTR through greater drug
adherence. Strategies for increasing drug adherence might improve quality of warfarin
anticoagulation.

BACKGROUND

large inter-individual variability in dose requirements [5,
6]. Thus, clinicians use the international normalized ratio
(INR) for monitoring the warfarin therapy. High values of
INR are associated with bleeding while low values of INR
are associated with thromboembolism and stroke [7, 8].
INR values are used to calculate the time in the therapeutic
range (TTR).
TTR is a measure of quality of anticoagulation
therapy and high TTR values mean a good quality of
treatment [9, 10]. A study conducted in Europe, included
6,250 patients with AF using warfarin from different
countries, showed that TTR levels ranged from 66.0%
in Italy to 72.6% in the United Kingdom. In France,
Germany, and Italy, less than 50% of the patients had TTR

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac
arrhythmia and it has a high estimated prevalence of 33.5
million people in worldwide [1, 2]. The prevalence of this
disease increases with age from < 0.5% between 40 and
50 years, to 5% to 15% at > 80 years of age [3]. AF may
be associated with severe consequences, like stroke with
neurological deficit and death [4]. Anticoagulation therapy
is the most important measure for preventing stroke in the
AF setting.
Warfarin is the most commonly used oral
anticoagulant for preventing stroke in patients with AF.
However, this drug has a narrow therapeutic index and a

> 70% [11]. Another study, including 377 patients and
considering TTR < 60% as a marker of poor quality in the
anticoagulation control, showed that 44.3% of the patients
had a poor anticoagulation therapy [12].
Age, body mass index, concomitant drugs, patient
adherence and genetic factors can influence INR values
[13-15]. However, the factors which can significantly
influence TTR measures, i.e., warfarin anticoagulation
therapy in the long-term are not fully understood [9,
16]. Identification of factors that influence TTR values is
important to guide the best clinical approach during the
treatment. In this scenario, the main aim of the present
study was to evaluate the impact of variables on the TTR
for warfarin therapy in patients with AF from a referral
cardiovascular hospital.

We also observed higher TTR mean in patients with age
≥65 years than patient with age < 65 years in the female
group (66±21% and 61±23%, p = 0.04, respectively)
and in the male group (68±23% and 59±25%, p = 0.01,
respectively). The variable self-declared race was not
associated with TTR, even in multivariate models. The
TTR mean of the White and non-White groups were not
different (64±23% and 62±23%, p = 0.24, respectively).
In a multivariate linear regression model, we
analyzed the effect of variables, including age, in years,
on TTR values (Table 3). We show that age was also
associated with TTR values (p = 0.02). Supplementary
table 1 shows a linear regression model with the addition
of other variables.
In a multivariate logistic regression model, we
analyzed TTR median (≥68.0%) as a dependent variable
and the following variables as independent: age ≥65 years,
sex (male), self-declared race (White), BMI, smoking,
amiodarone use, CYP2C9 predicted metabolic phenotypes
(IM+PM) and VKORC1 genotypes (Table 4). The variable
age ≥65 years was significantly associated with having a
TTR value above the median (OR = 2.17, 95%CI = 1.433.28, p < 0.001). Supplementary Table 2 shows a logistic
regression model including other independent variables.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows demographic and clinical
characteristics of the patients according to age over 65
years. Mean age in the younger group was 56±9 years (n
= 190) and in the older was 73±6 years (n = 253). We
observed higher percentages of self-declared White,
diabetes mellitus, and time in warfarin therapy in the
group of patients with age ≥65 years compared with group
of patients with age < 65 years.
Table 2 shows TTR mean according to age over 65
years. We observed that, in the overall group, patients with
age ≥65 years had higher TTR mean than patients with age
< 65 years (67±22% and 60±24%, p = 0.004, respectively).

showed this same association. A study including 501
Japanese patients to evaluate factors influencing TTR,
such as age, gender, antiplatelet drugs, CHADS2 score and
warfarin dose showed that patients aged ≥70 years had
TTR of 77±17% and patients aged < 70 years had TTR of
46±23% (p < 0.001) [16]. Another study, including 6,983
patients from diverse regions of the world, showed that
patients with age < 73 years had lower TTR mean levels
than patients with age ≥73 years (53.6±20.9 vs 56.8±21.5,
respectively, p < 0.001) [9]. Furthermore, Skeppholm et
al showed that younger patients spent more time out of
therapeutic range than older patients [17].
We suggest that TTR can be influenced by age
presumably because older people have higher compliance
(drug adherence) than younger. Here, we chose the
age according to the definition of elderly person by
WHO (World Health Organization) [18]. Indeed, it has
been showed that age younger than 65 years was a risk
factor for non-adherence to warfarin [19-21]. Witt et al
showed that mean age was higher in patients adherent
than in patients non-adherent (70.9 years vs 63.8 years;
p < 0.001) [20]. A study examined the medication taking
behavior of older adults. They found that age, gender,
education level, marital status, living status and health
belief affected the medication knowledge and behavior.
They also showed that younger patients had a limited
knowledge about their disease and this may be a reason for
non-adherence [22]. The greatest adherence to treatment
by older people might also be influenced for greater
severity of illness and successful compliance behavior
by caregivers at home [23]. Another study showed that
elderly patients were more adherent to medications after
hospital discharge, had an increased interaction with the

healthcare system (appointments, number of physician
interactions), had higher knowledge about the importance
of chronic medication management and had a higher level
of experience with managing medications [24]. In the
present study, we observed difference in time in warfarin
therapy, in years (5.0±4.6 vs 6.2±5.0), according to age
group. However, we showed that this small difference did
not affect TTR values in a multivariate analysis.
A recent study showed that TTR is an independent
predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in their
cohort of AF patients. Moreover, the authors showed
that age were positively associated to major adverse
cardiovascular events and a good anticoagulation is
associated with a reduction of these events [25].
Sex and self-declared race did not influence the TTR
in our analysis. Okumura et al also did not find differences
in TTR mean according sex [16]. However, Singer et al
showed that male patients had higher TTR than female
patients (56.4±21.2 vs 53.3±21.3 p < 0.001); and Rose et
al showed that the group with TTR > 75% had the lowest
proportion of females (37.9%) compared to the group with
TTR < 60% (46.5%, p < 0.001) [9, 26]. Bhandari et al
reported that African-American patients spent less time
in range compared with White-American patients (32.2%
vs 42.0%, p < 0.001) [27]. Another study showed that
African-Americans spent more time in the sub-therapeutic
range (INR < 2) [28].
Neither warfarin dose nor CYP2C9 and VKORC1
polymorphisms influence TTR in the present study.
However, Okumura et al. found that warfarin dose affected
TTR, patients with a low dose ( < 2.5mg/day) had higher
TTR compared to patients with higher dose (≥5.0mg/
day) (72±22%; 48±24%; p < 0.001). They suggested
54196

that age might have affected the dose administered by
the physician. Patients aged < 70 years had higher dose
(3.5±1.2mg/day) than patients aged ≥70 years (2.7±1.0mg/
day). However, after multivariate analysis, they showed
that warfarin dose remained an independent predictor
of TTR [16]. Importantly, in our study, the variable age
did not affect warfarin dose. Some studies showed that
CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms influenced TTR
mean during initiation of therapy with warfarin [14, 15,
29]. We did not find this association probably because our
patient group were anticoagulated for at least 12 months.
The variables diabetes mellitus, hypertension
and heart failure did not influence TTR mean in our
study. These variables are components of the CHADS2
score, which estimates stroke risk in patients with atrial
fibrillation. Other variables compose the score, such as age
≥75 and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack
symptoms [30, 31]. Okuwura et al. found that CHADS2
score influenced TTR. Patients with a score ≤ 1 had TTR
of 59±27% and patients with a score ≥2 had 68±23%. The
authors explained this finding by the fact that the age of
the patients with a score ≥2 (73±8 years) was significantly
higher than those patients with a score ≤ 1 (65±11 years)
(p < 0.001) [16]. On the contrary, Singer et al found that
patients with higher CHADS2 score (≥2) had lower TTR
mean levels (score ≤ 2: TTR = 59.3±19.7; score 3-6:
TTR < 55.1±21.3; p < 0.01) [9]. Furthermore, another
study showed that CHADS2 score did not influence TTR
[26]. In addition, Singer et al. showed that patients with
heart failure had lower TTR mean levels (52.9±21.2 vs
59.0±20.7 p < 0.001) [9] and Rose et al. found that heart
failure was associated with poor control (TTR < 60% =
26.1% vs TTR > 75% = 20.5% p < 0.001) [26].
Our study has some potential limitations. First,
we were not able to use SAMe TT2R2 score in patients
with kidney and liver diseases, because we excluded
these patients. Second, we did not apply questionnaires
about drug adherence; thus, we were not able to test our
hypothesis that the elderly had more drug adherence.
Furthermore, we did not assess diet, which might be
different according to the age group. Second, the influence
of the variables on TTR depends on the characteristics
of the patient sample. Our sample included patients
with atrial fibrillation treated for at least 12 months
with warfarin in a referral hospital. Our findings can be
different from those of others because of the specifics of
our casuistic.
White et al, analyzing the outcome of 3,587
patients with warfarin therapy from SPORTIF III and IV,
indicated that the risks of death, myocardial function and
stroke or systemic embolic event were lower in patients
with TTR ≥60% than in those with TTR < 60% [10].
Here, we highlight the importance of studying variables
that may influence TTR levels. We showed that age is
associated with TTR. We suggest that age influenced TTR
through greater drug adherence. Strategies for increasing

drug adherence might improve the quality of warfarin
anticoagulation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and study design
This retrospective study included 443 patients with
non-valvular AF treated with warfarin for at least 12
months, from 2011 to 2014, from a referral cardiovascular
hospital [32]. The Institutional Ethics Committee (Register
Number 0804/10) approved the study protocol and written
informed consent was obtained from all participants prior
to entering the study. The exclusion criteria were patients
with chronic liver failure, using other anticoagulant drugs,
receiving chemotherapy, and alcoholism. We obtained
data regarding current drug use through a standardized
interview with a pharmacist and checked electronic
medical records.

Measures and outcomes
We used prothrombin time (PT) for evaluating oral
anticoagulant therapy and obtained the INR calculation by
the ratio PT of the patient/normal PT controls, elevated
to the international sensitivity index [6, 33]. We collected
blood samples to assess current INR and DNA analysis.
Besides, we checked past INR values in electronic medical
records from the 12 months preceding enrollment. We
calculated TTR of the past 12 months using the Rosendaal
method [34], which uses linear interpolation to assign an
INR value to each day between successive observed INR
values.
Genotyping of CYP2C9*2 (c.430C > T, rs1799853),
CYP2C9*3 (c.1075A > C, rs1057910), and VKORC1 3673
(g.1639G > A, rs9923231) polymorphisms was carried
out by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction
enzyme digestion [35, 36]. As quality control, 6% of
the samples were reanalyzed and gave identical results.
Patients were divided into distinct predicted phenotypes:
extensive metabolizer (EM: wild-type genotypes for
the CYP2C9 polymorphisms - *1/*1), intermediate
metabolizer (IM: heterozygous genotypes for the loss-offunction CYP2C9 polymorphisms - *1/*2 or *1/*3) and
poor metabolizer (PM: mutant homozygous or compound
heterozygous genotypes for the loss-of-function CYP2C9
polymorphisms - *2/*2 or *3/*3 or *2/*3) [37].

Statistical analysis
We present categorical variables as percentages
and continuous variables as mean ± standard deviation.
We divided patients into groups according to age: patients

with < 65 years and patients with ≥65 years [38]. TTR was
adjusted for age, sex, BMI (body mass index), and selfdeclared race. We tested the effect of the age (in years)
on TTR values in a multivariate linear regression model
including the following independent variables: age, sex,
BMI, race, smoking, amiodarone use, CYP2C9 genotypes
(EM, IM or PM), and VKORC1 genotypes. In addition,
we performed a multivariate logistic regression model
to evaluate factors associated with values of TTR above
median (≥68.0%), including the following variables: age
(≥65 years), sex (male), BMI, self-declared race (White),
smoking, amiodarone use, CYP2C9 genotypes (IM+PM),
and VKORC1 genotypes. All statistical analyses were
carried out using SPSS software (v. 16.0) and the level of
significance set at p ≤ 0.05.
