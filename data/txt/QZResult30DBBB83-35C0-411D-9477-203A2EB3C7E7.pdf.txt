ABSTRACT:
Cyclic AMP (cAMP) regulates a number of cellular processes and modulates cell
death induction. cAMP levels are altered upon stimulation of specific G-protein-coupled
receptors inhibiting or activating adenylyl cyclases. Opioid receptor stimulation can
activate inhibitory Gi-proteins which in turn block adenylyl cyclase activity reducing
cAMP. Opioids such as D,L-methadone induce cell death in leukemia cells. However,
the mechanism how opioids trigger apoptosis and activate caspases in leukemia cells
is not understood. In this study, we demonstrate that downregulation of cAMP induced
by opioid receptor activation using the opioid D,L-methadone kills and sensitizes
leukemia cells for doxorubicin treatment. Enhancing cAMP levels by blocking opioidreceptor signaling strongly reduced D,L-methadone-induced apoptosis, caspase
activation and doxorubicin-sensitivity. Induction of cell death in leukemia cells by
activation of opioid receptors using the opioid D,L-methadone depends on critical
levels of opioid receptor expression on the cell surface. Doxorubicin increased opioid
receptor expression in leukemia cells. In addition, the opioid D,L-methadone increased
doxorubicin uptake and decreased doxorubicin efflux in leukemia cells, suggesting
that the opioid D,L-methadone as well as doxorubicin mutually increase their cytotoxic
potential. Furthermore, we found that opioid receptor activation using D,L-methadone
alone or in addition to doxorubicin inhibits tumor growth significantly in vivo. These
results demonstrate that opioid receptor activation via triggering the downregulation
of cAMP induces apoptosis, activates caspases and sensitizes leukemia cells for
doxorubicin treatment. Hence, opioid receptor activation seems to be a promising
strategy to improve anticancer therapies.

INTRODUCTION

have a poor outcome [4] which is mainly determined by
the response to chemotherapy, involving a number of
deregulated pathways like differentiation, survival and
apoptosis [3, 5-7].
The main goal in chemotherapies is the concerted
destruction of cells via apoptosis [8, 9]. Apoptosis can be
mediated via the external death receptor/ligand pathway
or the intrinsic pathway involving caspases [8-10]. Proapoptotic proteins like Bax and anti-apoptotic proteins

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the
most frequent malignant disease in children but affects
adolescents as well [1]. The intensification of treatment
regimens and advances in supportive care, improved
the survival rates of childhood ALL to 80%, whereas in
adults the overall survival rate remains at approximately
40% [2, 3]. Unfortunately, patients suffering from relapse

(Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, XIAP) frequently involved in malignancies
and treatment resistances regulate apoptosis induction [7,
11-14].
Previous studies showed that the second messenger
cyclic AMP (cAMP) inhibits doxorubicin as well as DNAdamage-induced apoptosis [15, 16]. cAMP regulates a
number of cellular processes. The production of cAMP
is either increased or decreased upon stimulation of
G-protein-coupled receptors which activate or inhibit
adenylyl cyclases. cAMP is responsible for a multitude of
actions like ion channel regulation and kinase activation
[17-19]. Furthermore, cAMP can either stimulate or inhibit
programmed cell death [20].
Methadone is a full-opioid agonist used as
substitution for heroin or other opiates but also as longlasting analgesic in cancer pain [21]. Opioid receptor
activation initiates a cascade of events resulting in a
diversity of biological effects like analgesis, sedation
but also effects on cell survival and proliferation can be
observed [22-25]. Opioid receptor stimulation can activate
inhibitory Gi-proteins which in turn block adenylyl
cyclase activity reducing cAMP [17].
The opioid D,L-methadone induces apoptosis
in human T-lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia cell
lines and overcomes chemoresistance in leukemia cells
without affecting healthy lymphocytes [25]. Singh et
al found an effective synergism in cell death induction
using D,L-methadone in addition to an anti-Bcl-2-agent
[23]. Furthermore, D,L-methadone strongly inhibits
proliferation of leukemia and human lung cancer cell lines
[22, 25-27].
In this study, we found that opioid receptor
activation induces cell death sensitization of leukemia
cells ex vivo and in vivo. Our work provides evidence
that the downregulation of cAMP induced by opioid
receptor triggering induces apoptosis, activates caspases
and sensitizes leukemia cells for doxorubicin treatment.
In addition, we demonstrate that the opioid D,Lmethadone-induced cell death depends on critical levels
of opioid receptor expression which can be increased
by doxorubicin. Additionally, D,L-methadone increases
doxorubicin influx and hampers its efflux in leukemia
cells.

of leukemia, we analyzed the anti-cancer effect of D,Lmethadone in different xenograft-derived ALL cells. The
xenografts were originally established from patients with
T-cell (ALL-SCID6, ALL-SCID3), B-cell (ALL-SCID7)
[28] and B-cell precursor (BCP, pre-B-ALL-SCID) acute
leukemia. First, we measured opioid-receptor expression
on xenograft-derived ALL cells. ALL-SCID6, ALLSCID3, and ALL-SCID7 leukemia cells displayed high
amounts of opioid-receptors whereas the pre-B-ALLSCID leukemia cells expressed only moderate levels of
opioid-receptors (Figure 1A). To analyze if cell death
induction using D,L-methadone depends on the levels
of opioid receptor expression, we treated the xenograftderived ALL cells with different concentrations of D,Lmethadone (Figure 1B). We used therapeutic plasma
concentrations of D,L-methadone (≤ 3µg/mL) and
included 10µg/mL D,L-methadone, because levels of
D,L-methadone in lymphatic tissue and marrow might
be higher [23]. Therapeutic plasma concentrations of
D,L-methadone (≤ 3µg/mL) induced a strong cell death
in xenograft-derived ALL cells (Figure 1B) expressing
high amounts of opioid-receptors (Figure 1A). In
contrast, the xenograft-derived-BCP-ALL cells (pre-BALL-SCID) expressing moderate opioid-receptor levels
(Figure 1A) could only be slightly killed with therapeutic
concentrations of D,L-methadone (Figure 1B). Therefore,
apoptosis induction by D,L-methadone seems to depend
on the level of opioid-receptor expression.

D,L-methadone
sensitizes ALL-cells
for
doxorubicin-induced cell death and caspase
activation
In analogous studies, we tested the cytotoxic
potential of D,L-methadone on BCP-ALL cell lines
(Tanoue, Reh, Nalm6) expressing opioid-receptors in a
moderate level on their cell surface (Figure 2A). These
BCP-ALL cell lines could only be killed slightly by
D,L-methadone (Figure 2B) as observed for xenograftderived-BCP-ALL cells (pre-B-ALL-SCID) (Figure 1B).
As different substances can act synergistically, we treated
Tanoue, Reh, Nalm6, and xenograft-derived-BCP-ALL
cells (pre-B-ALL-SCID) with different concentrations of
D,L-methadone and doxorubicin alone or in combination
with each other (Figure 2 B, 2C and 2D). We observed
that the combination treatment strongly killed the BCPALL cell lines (Figure 2B) and strongly reduced survival
of BCP-ALL cell lines markedly (Figure 2C). The
combination treatment also strongly killed xenograftderived-BCP-ALL cells (pre-B-ALL-SCID) (Figure 2D).
To analyze the molecular pathways of cell killing
in more detail and to find out how the combination
treatment with D,L-methadone and doxorubicin induced
apoptosis, we analyzed which apoptotic effector molecules
are activated in BCP-ALL cells upon this combination

treatment compared to cells treated with D,L-methadone
or doxorubicin alone. 120h after treating the BCP-ALL
cell line Tanoue with D,L-methadone in addition to
doxorubicin, we observed the activation of the caspase
cascade in BCP-ALL cells. We found a strong activation
of caspase-3 and caspase-9 and cleavage of the prototype
substrate of caspase-3, PARP (Figure 3A).
The role of the caspase cascade in apoptosis
induction was further investigated with the broad-spectrum
inhibitor of caspases zVAD.fmk. zVAD.fmk strongly
decreased cell death after combination treatment with D,Lmethadone and doxorubicin in BCP-ALL cells (Figure 3B)
underlining the dependence on caspase activation.
The apoptotic machinery is tightly controlled by
anti-apoptotic factors like XIAP and Bcl-xL [11, 12] which
we found to be strongly downregulated in BCP-ALL cells
treated with D,L-methadone in addition to doxorubicin
(Figure 3C). These results indicate that the combination
of D,L-methadone and doxorubicin sensitizes BCP-ALL
cells for apoptosis via the activation of caspases and
downregulation of XIAP and Bcl-xL.

The efficiency of cell death induction and activation
of effector molecules in apoptosis pathways after treating
leukemia cells with D,L-methadone seems to depend on
the amount of opioid-receptors displayed on the cell`s
surface. Combination treatment with D,L-methadone and
doxorubicin kills leukemia cells with moderate opioid
receptor expression, which could only be killed slightly by
D,L-methadone or doxorubicin alone. Chemotherapeutics
enhance the expression of receptors like CD95 in leukemia
cells [29]. To analyze whether doxorubicin might influence
the opioid-receptor expression, we treated the BCP-ALL
cell line Tanoue with doxorubicin for 96h. Afterwards, the
relative amount of opioid-receptors compared to untreated
cells was measured by flow cytometry. We found that
doxorubicin strongly increased opioid-receptor expression
(Figure 4A) suggesting that D,L-methadone can bind in
higher amounts to cells co-treated with doxorubicin.
Opioids as well as doxorubicin are substrates

of the in multi-drug resistances-involved efflux pump
P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Furthermore, D,L-methadone
is known to inhibit P-gp [30-33]. To analyze whether
D,L-methadone might influence the uptake and/or efflux
of doxorubicin in leukemia cells, the BCP-ALL cell
line Tanoue was incubated for different intervals with
doxorubicin alone or with a combination of doxorubicin
and D,L-methadone. After 4h, 8h, 24h (maximum uptake),
we observed an enhanced doxorubicin concentration in the
cells co-incubated with doxorubicin and D,L-methadone
(Figure 4B). 24h after maximum uptake of doxorubicin,
doxorubicin was removed from the supernatant and
fresh medium was added without doxorubicin and D,Lmethadone was applied. After 8h and 24h, D,L-methadone
reduced the doxorubicin efflux strongly (Figure 4C)

indicating that D,L-methadone increases doxorubicin
uptake and inhibits doxorubicin efflux out of leukemia
cells. This suggests that D,L-methadone as well as
doxorubicin mutually increase their cytotoxic potential.

Apoptosis induction by D,L-methadone and
doxorubicin depends on opioid receptor activation
inducing cAMP downregulation
To further analyze the role of opioid-receptor
triggering in apoptosis induction and consequently
activation of apoptotic pathways, the BCP-ALL cell line
Tanoue was treated with D,L-methadone, doxorubicin
or with the opioid-receptor antagonist naloxone alone
or in different combinations with each other (Figure

alone (- Doxo), with 0.06µg/mL doxorubicin (+ Doxo) alone or with D,L-methadone in addition to doxorubicin (+ Doxo). After 120h,
Western blot analyses for caspase-9, caspase-3 and PARP were performed. The active fragment of caspase-9 was detected at ~37 kDa, the
active fragment of caspase-3 at ~19 kDa and ~17 kDa and PARP cleavage at ~85 kDa. Equal protein loading was controlled by anti-β-actin
antibody. (b) D,L-Methadone and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis depends on caspase activation. Pre-incubation of the cell line Tanoue

described in Figure 1B. Columns, mean of triplicates; bars, SD<10%. (c) Downregulation of XIAP and Bcl-xL by D,L-methadone and

analyses for XIAP and Bcl-xL were performed. XIAP was detected at ~58 kDa and Bcl-xL at ~30 kDa. Equal protein loading was controlled

5A and 5B). After 96h, we found that blocking opioidreceptors by naloxone strongly reduced the apoptotic
rates of the combination treatment with D,L-methadone
and doxorubicin (Figure 5A). Additionally, naloxone cotreatment drastically reduced the activation of caspase-9
and caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP (Figure 5B)
indicating that opioid-receptor triggering is involved in
apoptosis induction and in caspase activation.
Opioid receptor stimulation activates inhibitory
Gi-proteins which in turn block adenylyl cyclase activity
reducing cAMP (Figure 7) [18]. Pertussis toxin (PTX)
inactivates Gi-proteins and blocks downregulation of
cAMP (Figure 7) [34]. IBMX, however, increases cAMP
levels as a result of phosphodiesterase inhibition (Figure
7). To analyze the critical role of cAMP in opioid receptor
activation-induced apoptosis, the BCP-ALL cell line
Tanoue was treated with D,L-methadone, doxorubicin, and
IBMX or PTX either alone or in different combinations
with each other (Figure 5C and 5D). After 96h we found
that upregulation of cAMP by IBMX (Figure 5C) as well
as blocking downregulation of cAMP by PTX (Figure
5D) strongly reduced the apoptotic rates of combination
treatment with D,L-methadone and doxorubicin. In
addition, the upregulation of cAMP by IBMX also
decreased doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (Figure 5C).
These results indicate that the activation of Gi-protein-

coupled opioid receptors is essential for the induction of
apoptosis which might be regulated via the intracellular
cAMP levels.

Inhibition of tumor growth in vivo
In vitro results demonstrated that D,L-methadone
induces apoptosis in several leukemia cell lines and
increases the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. To confirm
the clinical relevance of the anti-cancer potential of D,Lmethadone alone or in combination with doxorubicin and
to verify the results obtained so far an ALL-xenograft
study was undertaken (Figure 6).
For the in vivo study, a patient-derived ALLxenograft model (ALL-SCID6) was used. Its phenotypic
and genotypic identity with the original patient
sample was proven [28]. The experiment started with
subcutaneous inoculation of ALL-SCID6 fragments from
an in vivo passage into male NOD/SCID/IL2rγ null (NSG)
mice. After randomization, D,L-methadone was orally
administered after ALL-inoculation with increasing doses.
When tumors were palpable, doxorubicin treatment was
initiated. D,L-Methadone and doxorubicin treatment led
to a significant inhibition of tumor growth at comparable
levels (Figure 6). Combination treatment with D,L-

to remove doxorubicin. After washing doxorubicin-treated BCP-ALL cells, BCP-ALL cells were either left untreated (black columns, D,L-Methadone) or treated with 3µg/mL D,L-methadone (hatched columns, + D,L-Methadone) and incubated for different points in time
(8h, 24h). Doxorubicin efflux was analyzed via doxorubicin fluorescence in cells using flow cytometry after 8h and 24h. Values are mean

methadone and doxorubicin had a similar anti-tumor
efficacy as D,L-methadone or doxorubicin alone until day
70 (Figure 6). At later time points, the tumor inhibition
was longer lasting during the combined treatment of D,Lmethadone and doxorubicin (Figure 6). The therapy was
well-tolerated with body weight changes of -10% for the
combination and -8% or -4% for the D,L-methadone or
doxorubicin treatment, respectively. To analyze D,Lmethadone serum concentrations in mice, 0.5h, 1h,
4h and 24h after the last D,L-methadone application,
serum was taken and D,L-methadone quantified by mass
spectrometry. The serum concentrations of methadone
were found between 56ng/mL and 230ng/mL in the time

course of 0.5h until 4h after D,L-methadone application.
The serum concentrations of doxorubicin were found
between 156ng/mL and 198ng/mL. These results
demonstrate that D,L-methadone and the co-treatment
using doxorubicin and D,L-methadone significantly
inhibited tumor growth in vivo.

DISCUSSION
ALL is a malignant disorder originating from
single B- or T-lymphocyte progenitors [1]. Despite the
significant progress made in the overall cure rate, the
prognosis of relapsed ALL patients still remains poor [2]

as cellular resistances to anti-cancer drugs occur [3, 6, 7,
35-37]. Hence, it is important to find alternate therapies
overcoming resistances. Recent studies demonstrate that
D,L-methadone kills leukemia cells in vitro and inhibits
cell proliferation of lung cancer cells [22, 23, 25-27].
Additionally, D,L-methadone abrogates chemoresistance
in leukemia cell lines without affecting normal
lymphocytes [25]. Co-treatment with D,L-methadone and
an anti-Bcl-2-agent leads to synergistic effects in leukemia
cells [23]. However, the underlying mechanisms how D,Lmethadone leads to apoptosis induction are not understood.
Additionally, the tumor growth inhibitory potential of D,Lmethadone has not been demonstrated in vivo nor have
the synergistic effects in cell killing with conventionally
administered chemotherapeutics been analyzed. In this
study, we provide evidence that D,L-methadone induces
apoptosis, activates caspases and increases doxorubicintriggered cell death in leukemia cells after opioid-receptor
activation inducing the downregulation of cAMP. In
addition, we demonstrate first that D,L-methadone can
strongly reduce tumor growth of ALL in vivo.
Methadone binds as agonist to mu-opioid receptors.
We found that D,L-methadone kills xenograft-derived
ALL cells expressing high levels of opioid receptors. In
contrast, D,L-methadone induces cell death only slightly
in xenograft-derived ALL cells and cell lines expressing
moderate opioid receptor amounts indicating that D,Lmethadone-induced apoptosis depends on critical levels

of opioid receptor expression in leukemia cells.
Combination treatment may prove to be
advantageous in malignancies that still partially respond
to either treatment alone as different therapeutics are
known to interact with each other amplifying weaker
death signals [2, 5, 35, 38-43]. Combination treatment
with D,L-methadone and doxorubicin enhances the antitumor efficacy of both agents synergistically in BCPALL cells expressing moderate levels of opioid-receptors
and increases caspase activation playing a critical role
in apoptosis induction in sensitive and resistant cancer
cells [6]. Furthermore, the downregulation of the antiapoptotic proteins XIAP and Bcl-xL involved in the
occurrence of resistances in many malignancies like ALL
or NHL [44-48] is markedly enhanced. These suggest that
combination treatment of D,L-methadone and doxorubicin
increases apoptosis induction, caspase activation and
downregulation of XIAP and Bcl-xL synergistically.
Resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic
drugs is a limiting factor of therapies whereby multidrug
resistances resulting from overexpression of drug
transporters such as P-gp are well-characterized [33,
49]. While in healthy cells the P-gp expression belongs
to the normal cellular defense system, in cancer cells the
overexpression of P-gp correlates with decreased survival
and poor outcome [50, 51]. D,L-Methadone could be
shown to be a substrate of P-gp [33, 49] inhibiting its
action [30-32]. We found that co-treatment of doxorubicin
with D,L-methadone enhances doxorubicin uptake and
furthermore inhibits doxorubicin-efflux out of leukemia
cells, suggesting that D,L-methadone sensitizes leukemia
cells for doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by increasing
concentrations of doxorubicin within the cells.
Posovsky et al found that chemotherapeutic drugs
like doxorubicin sensitize BCP-ALL cells expressing low
amounts of CD95 receptors on their surface for CD95mediated apoptosis and caspase activation by upregulating
CD95 receptors [29]. The enhanced toxicity of the
combination treatment of D,L-methadone and doxorubicin
is associated with an increased expression of opioidreceptors after doxorubicin treatment. Therefore, D,Lmethadone can bind in higher amounts to cells co-treated
with doxorubicin. These results indicate that the enhanced
toxicity in the combination treatment with D,L-methadone
and doxorubicin is associated with the upregulation of

furthermore with an increased uptake and decreased efflux
of doxorubicin mediated by D,L-methadone.
Opioid receptors signal by catalyzing liganddependent nucleotide exchange on Gi, thereby inhibiting
adenylyl cyclase and modulating N-type calcium channels
as well as G-protein–gated inwardly rectifying potassium
(GIRK) channels leading to changes in cell signaling
(Figure 7) [52]. The dependence of apoptosis induction
on opioid-receptor triggering is underlined by their
inhibition. Blocking opioid-receptor signaling with the

opioid receptor antagonist naloxone inhibited combination
treatment with D,L-methadone and doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis and caspase activation in a high rate, suggesting
that opioid-receptor triggering by D,L-methadone is
involved in apoptosis induction and caspase activation
(Figure 7). Maneckjee et al showed for human lung
cancer cells that the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone
in combination with methadone increased cAMP levels
suggesting that inhibition of opioid receptor activation
by methadone rises cAMP [26]. The second messenger
cAMP is involved in a number of physiologic functions
in response to various extracellular stimuli controlling
cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis whereby
it can either inhibit or stimulate apoptosis dependent on
the respective cell type [20, 53]. For various tumor cells
like pancreatic or leukemia cells stimulated with different
agents, it could be demonstrated that cAMP elevation is
associated with impaired cell death [54-56]. Responsible
for this protective action of cAMP against apoptosis is
among others the synthesis of anti-apoptotic proteins,
inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins, and activation of
PI3K-dependent Akt [57-59]. In the AML cell line HL60, for instance, PKA inhibitors impair the cytoprotective
effect from cAMP on the cells [60]. Activation of cAMP
plays also a critical role in inhibiting DNA-damage- and
doxorubicin-induced apoptosis via p53 dephosphorylation
[15, 16] and furthermore by NF-κB activation [61]. Opioid
receptor stimulation activates inhibitory Gi-proteins
which in turn block adenylyl cyclase activity reducing
cAMP [17]. We found that D,L-methadone induced

apoptosis and activated caspases by triggering opioid
receptors via downregulation of cAMP. Blocking the
activation of opioid receptors by naloxone or inhibiting Giproteins with PTX increased cAMP and strongly reduced
apoptotic signaling triggered by the co-treatment with
D,L-methadone and doxorubicin. In addition, upregulation
of cAMP by inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterases
using IBMX reduced the cytoxicity of the combination
treatment using D,L-methadone and doxorubicin in human
BCP-ALL cells. Furthermore, opioid receptor triggering
by D,L-methadone inhibits proliferation and leads to
accumulation of leukemia cells in G1-phase which was
previously observed [25]. These results suggest that
opioid receptor activation by D,L-methadone triggers
downregulation of cAMP mediating caspase activation
and apoptosis induction in leukemia cells (Figure 7) and
sensitizes leukemia cells for doxorubicin treatment.
In vitro results have shown that D,L-methadone can
induce apoptosis in several leukemia cell lines [23, 25]. In
the current study, we could verify the clinical relevance
with patient-derived ALL cells ex vivo and we provide
the first evidence that D,L-methadone as monotherapy or
in combination with doxorubicin leads to a strong tumor
growth inhibition in a patient-derived leukemia model
in vivo. Both the anti-leukemic efficacy and the side
effects of D,L-methadone alone or in combination with
doxorubicin were comparable with those of doxorubicin
alone. Anyhow, a longer lasting growth inhibition could
be proven upon combination treatment. The serum
concentrations of methadone in mice correlated with

Figure 7: Opioid receptor signaling. Stimulation of opioid receptors (OR) by agonists like D,L-methadone leads to an activation

of the inhibitory Gi-protein. The alphai-subunit inactivates adenylyl cyclases (AC) resulting in a reduction of cAMP levels within the cell
which in turn leads to apoptosis. Naloxone as opioid receptor antagonist inhibits competitively opioid receptors. PTX (pertussis toxin)
inactivates Gi-proteins and blocks downregulation of cAMP. IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) inhibits phosphodiesterase activity
(PDE) and increases cAMP levels.

Serum concentrations of methadone

the concentrations showing in vitro cytotoxicity. This
indicates that D,L-methadone may have a promising
therapeutic potential in leukemia therapy and could
improve therapeutic success of conventional therapies.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that
D,L-methadone induces apoptosis, mediates caspase
activation and sensitizes leukemia cells for doxorubicin
treatment through opioid receptor activation triggering
the downregulation of cAMP (Figure 7). D,L-methadoneinduced cell death depends on critical levels of
opioid receptor expression which can be increased by
doxorubicin. Additionally, D,L-methadone increases
doxorubicin influx and hampers its efflux in leukemia
cells. Furthermore, we could demonstrate for the first
time that D,L-methadone alone or in combination with
doxorubicin leads to a significant tumor growth inhibition
in a patient-derived leukemia model in vivo. These results
have important implications for the development of novel
strategies in cancer therapy especially when conventional
therapies are less effective.

Determination of methadone in serum samples was
carried out after liquid/liquid extraction using a mass
spectrometer equipped with a gas chromatograph (GC/
MS). As internal standard d9-methadone was added. The
mass selective detector was operated in electron impact
mode. Data were acquired in the selected-ion monitoring
mode. The analytes were identified with the following
masses m/z 294, 223, 72 (target ion) for methadone and
m/z 303, 226, and 78 for d9-methadone with a limit of
detection of 0.8ng/mL and a limit of quantification of
1.2ng/mL.

Serum concentrations of doxorubicin
Determination of doxorubicin and its main
metabolites in serum were performed as described
previously [62, 63]. Using this validated method, the
quantification of doxorubicin, doxorubicinol, and 7-deoxydoxorubicinolon was possible with a LLQ of 0.2ng/mL.

METHODS

Patient-derived ALL xenografts

Drugs and reagents

For in vivo use the ALL-SCID6 model was
chosen. Fragments from in vivo passaged tumors were
transplanted subcutaneously at day 0 to 32 male NOD/
SCID/IL2rγ null (NSG) mice. After randomization oral
treatment (by gavage) with D,L-methadone was initiated
one day later and performed daily until the end of the
experiment with increasing doses: 1stweek 20mg/kg/d,
2ndweek 30mg/kg/d, 3rdweek 40mg/kg/d, 4thweek 60mg/
kg/d, 5th-10thweek 2x60mg/kg/inj. The dose adaptation was
necessary to avoid toxic deaths because of an overdosage
of D,L-methadone. The maximum tolerated dose of D,Lmethadone in the employed mouse strain is 2x60mg/kg/
inj. At day 46, 53, 60 and 76 doxorubicin (3mg/kg) was
administered i.v. Tumor size was measured twice weekly
at two dimensions and tumor volumes were calculated
according to the formula (length x width2)/2. Mean tumor
volumes and standard deviations were calculated per
group. Treated to control values (T/C) in percent were
calculated by relating mean tumor volumes of each group
at each measurement day to the controls. Individual body
weight was determined twice per week as parameter for
tolerability. Body weight changes [%] were calculated
by relating the mean values of each group to the first
measurement day.
Serum from D,L-methadone treated mice was taken
0.5, 1, 4 and 24 hours after last D,L-methadone treatment
at day 76, respectively, and stored at -20°C until the
determination of methadone concentration. Mice were
sacrificed at day 77 for ethical reasons.
For the in vitro investigations, cell suspensions

For the in vitro experiments, D,L-methadone
hydrochloride (D,L-methadone) and doxorubicin were
purchased from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany), naloxone
from Fagron GmbH&Co. KG (Barsbüttel, Germany), and
pertussis toxin (PTX) from Calbiochem (Nottingham,
UK). Prior to each experiment these substances were
freshly dissolved in sterile distilled water to ensure
the constant quality of the preparations. 3-Isobutyl-1methylxanthine (IBMX, Sigma) was freshly dissolved in
0.01N NaOH.
For in vivo application, we used D,L-methadone
(Methaddict, Hexal, Germany) as 5mg tablets purchased
from the local pharmacy. The tablets were pulverized
and solubilized freshly before use in 10% Tween 80 in
saline. Doxorubicin (Hexal) was purchased as injection
solution (5mg/mL) and diluted freshly with saline to the
appropriate concentrations.

Cell lines
The human B-cell leukemia (BCP-ALL) cell lines
Tanoue, Reh and Nalm6 were obtained from the DSMZ
(Braunschweig, Germany) and cultured in RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS (Lonza, Verviers,
Belgium), 1mmol/L glutamine (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Invitrogen), 25mmol/L HEPES (Biochrom)
at 37°C, 95% air/ 5% CO2. In experimental settings, the
leukemia cells were seeded in a density of 100000 cells/
mL.

of human xenograft-derived ALL cells from patients
with T-cell (ALL-SCID6, ALL-SCID3), B-cell (ALLSCID7) and B-cell precursor (BCP, pre-B-ALL-SCID)
acute leukemia were gained and cultivated in vitro and
were phenotypically and genotypically characterized as
described [28]. All animal experiments were approved
by the local responsible authorities (LaGeSo Berlin) and
performed according to the guidelines for animal welfare
in oncological experiments [64].

cells was determined by FSC/SSC analysis via flow
cytometry [66].

Western blot analysis
Western blot analyses were performed as described
[37, 68-70]. Whole cell lysates were immunodetected for
PARP, caspase-3, caspase-9, XIAP, Bcl-xL and ß-actin
using rabbit-anti-PARP-polyclonal-antibody (1:5000,
Roche), anti-XIAP-monoclonal-antibody (both 1:1000,
BD Transduction Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany),
mouse-anti-caspase-3-monoclonal-antibody,
rabbitanti-caspase-9-polyclonal-antibody (both 1:1000, Cell
Signaling, Boston, MA, USA) rabbit-anti-Bcl-xLpolyclonal-antibody (1:1000, Santa-Cruz, Heidelberg,
Germany) and mouse-anti-ß-actin-monoclonal-antibody
(1:5000, Sigma). As secondary antibodies peroxidaseconjugated-goat-anti-mouse IgG or peroxidaseconjugated-goat-anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, Santa-Cruz)
were used for the enhanced chemoluminescence system
(ECL, Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). Equal
protein loading was controlled by ß-actin detection.

Flow cytometric assay for determination of cell
surface opioid-receptors
Cells were washed in PBS supplemented with
1% FCS, centrifuged and resuspended in PBS/1% FCS
containing naloxone-fluoresceine (0.05mM, Invitrogen)
[65]. After 30min of incubation at RT, the cells were
washed, centrifuged and resuspended in icecold PBS/1%
FCS. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using
FACSCalibur (BD, Heidelberg, Germany).

Induction of apoptosis and determination of cell
survival

Analysis of doxorubicin uptake and efflux

ALL cells were treated with D,L-methadone (≤ 3µg/
mL therapeutic plasma concentration) alone or in addition
to doxorubicin in 175cm2 flasks or 96-well plates. Further
experiments were performed simultaneously after addition
of 60µg/mL naloxone, 200µM IBMX (3-isobutyl-1methylxanthine) or 200ng/mL PTX (pertussis toxin). After
different points in time, apoptosis rates were measured
by flow cytometry [66, 67]. To determine apoptosis,
cells were lysed with Nicoletti-buffer containing sodium
citrate (0.1%), Triton X 100 (0.1%) and propidium iodide
(50µg/mL) as described by Nicoletti [67]. Apoptotic
cells were determined by hypodiploid DNA (subG1) or
forward scatter/side scatter analysis [66]. Cell survival was
determined by forward scatter/side scatter analysis using
flow cytometry [66]. The percentage of specific apoptosis
was calculated as follows: 100 x [experimental dead cells
(%) - spontaneous dead cells in medium (%)] / [100%
-spontaneous dead cells in medium (%)]. The spontaneous
dead cells were in the range of 5 to 10% using cell lines.
The spontaneous dead of untreated human xenograftderived ALL cells was less than 35% at 24h and 48h.

For analysis of doxorubicin uptake, the BCPleukemia cell line Tanoue was seeded in a density of
100000 cells/mL in 175cm2 flasks and was either left
untreated or incubated with 0.3µg/mL doxorubicin or a
combination of 0.3µg/mL doxorubicin and 3µg/mL D,Lmethadone. After different time point in time cells were
washed and the relative doxorubicin uptake in cells was
analyzed using flow cytometry.
For analysis of doxorubicin efflux, cells were
washed to remove doxorubicin from medium after
incubation for 24h (maximum uptake). Next, cells were
incubated with fresh medium without doxorubicin or
fresh medium containing 3µg/mL D,L-methadone without
doxorubicin to measure doxorubicin efflux. After different
time points, cells were harvested, washed and relative
doxorubicin content in leukemia cells was analyzed using
flow cytometry.
