Abstract
The TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK; TNFSF12) receptor Fn14 (TNFRSF12A) is expressed at low
levels in normal tissues but frequently highly expressed in a wide range of tumor types such as lung, melanoma,
and breast, and therefore it is a potentially unique therapeutic target for these diverse tumor types. We have
generated a recombinant protein containing a humanized, dimeric single-chain anti–ﬁbroblast growth factorinducible 14-kDa protein (Fn14) antibody fused to recombinant gelonin toxin as a potential therapeutic agent
(designated hSGZ). The hSGZ immunotoxin is a highly potent and selective agent that kills Fn14-positive (Fn14þ)
tumor cells in vitro. Treatment of cells expressing the MDR protein MDR1 (ABCB1B) showed no cross-resistance
to hSGZ. Induced overexpression of Fn14 levels in MCF7 cells through HER2 (ERBB2) signaling translated to an
improved therapeutic index of hSGZ treatment. In combination with trastuzumab, hSGZ showed an additive or
synergistic cytotoxic effect on HER2þ/Fn14þ breast cancer cell lines. Also, hSGZ treatment inhibited Erb3/Akt
signaling in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Pharmacokinetic studies in mice revealed that hSGZ
exhibited a biexponential clearance from plasma with a rapid initial clearance (t1/2a ¼ 1.26 hours) followed by a
seven-fold longer plasma half-life (t1/2b ¼ 7.29 hours). At 24, 48, and 72 hours after injection, uptake of the hSGZ
into tumors was 5.1, 4.8, and 4.7%ID/g, with a tumor-to-muscle ratio of 5.6, 6.2, and 9.0, respectively. Therapeutic
efﬁcacy studies showed signiﬁcant tumor inhibition effects using an MDA-MB-231/Luc breast cancer xenograft
model. Our ﬁndings show that hSGZ is an effective anticancer agent and a potential candidate for clinical studies.

Introduction
Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related
death in females worldwide (1). Despite the robust clinical
efﬁcacy of trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech) in HER2-positive (HER2þ) breast cancer, primary and secondary resistance
is frequently encountered (2). Inherent tumor heterogeneity
and upregulation of alternative survival pathways in tumor
cells frequently lead to emergence of resistance and treatment
failure. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of

breast cancer distinguished by the absence of three critical
regulatory receptors: estrogen, progesterone, and HER2. These
breast tumors generally display a more aggressive clinical
course exacerbated by the lack of effective targeted therapies
(3). There is a signiﬁcant need to identify new targets and
treatment approaches to overcome or suppress the emergence
of resistance. Thus, translational studies to develop novel
targeted therapeutics remain a clinical imperative.
Fibroblast growth factor–inducible 14-kDa protein (Fn14) is
the cell surface receptor for the cytokine TNF-like weak
inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK; ref. 4). This receptor has been
proposed as a novel target for cancer therapy because of its
strong overexpression in many types of solid tumors and the
intrinsic tumor cell killing capacity of the TWEAK-Fn14 pathway (5–7). TWEAK triggers multiple cellular responses, including proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and inﬂammation through its cognate receptor Fn14
(5, 6). TWEAK-dependent Fn14 signaling can exert either
protumorigenic (8) or antitumorigenic (9, 10) effects depending on the particular microenvironmental conditions in vivo
(6). TWEAK-independent Fn14 signaling may promote tumor
cell invasion and metastasis (6).
The Fn14 receptor is expressed at relatively low levels in
normal tissues but is dramatically elevated in a wide variety of
human tumor types (11–21) and also can be expressed by
tumor stroma and vasculature (5, 22). The correlation between

increased Fn14 expression and higher tumor grade and/or
poor prognosis has been documented in glioma (12, 13), breast
cancer (14, 23), esophageal cancer (15, 16), prostate cancer (17),
gastric cancer (18), and bladder cancer (19).
Two types of Fn14-targeted agents have been tested in
preclinical cancer studies—agonist antibodies (10, 11, 23, 24)
and immunotoxins (21, 25). Our group showed that an immunoconjugate designated ITEM4-rGel composed of a murine
monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the Fn14 receptor and
the recombinant toxin gelonin was highly efﬁcacious in
inhibiting tumor growth in vivo (25). To develop an Fn14targeted immunotoxin more suitable for clinical use, we
generated a humanized, dimeric single-chain ITEM-4 construct fused to rGel (designated hSGZ; ref. 21). The hSGZ
construct was shown to rapidly internalize and deliver the
rGel payload to the cytosol of tumor cells, where it enzymatically blocks protein synthesis. We have previously shown that
hSGZ binds to the extracellular domain of Fn14 with high
afﬁnity (Kd  1.4 nmol/L) and induces necrosis in Fn14positive (Fn14þ) melanoma target cells (21). In addition,
treatment of melanoma cells with the hSGZ construct upregulated cellular Fn14 expression and triggered cell signaling
events similar to the Fn14 ligand TWEAK. Administration of
hSGZ also showed excellent efﬁcacy in a melanoma xenograft
model (21).
In the current study, we examined the efﬁcacy of the hSGZ
construct against breast tumor cell lines and examined hSGZ
in combination with trastuzumab on HER2þ and Fn14þ breast
tumor cell lines. Some cell lines showed either an additive or a
synergistic cytotoxic effect. In addition, we found that breast
tumor cells resistant to chemotherapeutic agents were not
signiﬁcantly cross-resistant to hSGZ. Targeting Fn14 by hSGZ
resulted in inhibition of the Erb3/Akt signaling pathway in
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. We further examined
the in vitro and in vivo efﬁcacy of hSGZ on breast cancer cells
and the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of hSGZ in mice.
These ﬁndings support the proposal that Fn14 is a potential
therapeutic target for both HER2þ and TNBC as well as other
Fn14 overexpressing tumors such as melanoma and warrant
the clinical investigation of hSGZ as a novel targeted agent for
these cancer subtypes.

studies. To determine the effects of drug sequencing, cells were
treated with three different sequences: sequence I—cells were
pretreated with a trastuzumab for 6 hours, followed by coadministration with hSGZ for 72 hours; sequence II—cells were
pretreated with hSGZ for 6 hours, followed by coadministration with trastuzumab for 72 hours; and sequence III—coexposure of hSGZ and trastuzumab to the cells for 72 hours.
Pharmacokinetic study
The hSGZ was labeled with the near-IR (NIR) ﬂuorescence
dye IRDye 800CW (LI-COR Biosciences) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Female BALB/c mice (5–7 weeks old)
were injected (i.v. via tail vein) with 80 mg of IRDye 800CWlabeled hSGZ (IR-hSGZ; ratio of dye/protein ¼ 0.5). Three mice
at each time point were sacriﬁced at 10, 20, 40, and 60 minutes
and 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after administration. Blood
samples were removed from the chest cavity and ﬂuorescent
activity assayed using the In Vivo Imaging Systems (IVIS) 200
system (Xenogen Corp., ﬁlter sets: excitation/emission, 760/
800 nm). The results from plasma determinations of drug
concentration were analyzed by a least squares nonlinear
regression using WinNonlin 5.0.1 software (Pharsight Corp.).
Biodistribution study
Fifteen Nu/Nu mice bearing MDA-MB-231/Luc tumors
received i.v. injection of IRDye 800CW-labeled hSGZ (dye/
protein ¼ 0.5) through the tail vein at a dose of 80 mg per
mouse. At 24, 48, or 72 hours after injection, the mice (n ¼ 5)
were euthanized and dissected. Blood and organ tissues,
including heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, stomach, intestine,
uterus, skin, muscle, bone, brain, and tumor, were removed
from each mouse for quantitative optical imaging. The tissues
were weighed, and ﬂuorescent activity of each tissue was
measured using the IVIS 100 system (Xenogen Corp.) using
the indocyanine green (ICG) ﬁlter sets (excitation/emission,
710–760/810–875 nm).
In vivo efﬁcacy studies
Animal procedures were carried out according to a protocol
approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation
of Laboratory Animal Care–approved Animal Care and Use
Facility at MDACC. Female BALB/c nude mice (6–8 weeks old)
were injected (hind ﬂank) s.c. with MDA-MB-231/Luc cells
(8  106 cells/mouse; suspended in 100 mL of PBS mixed with
100 mL BD Matrigel). Once tumors reached a mean volume of
approximately 100 mm3, animals were treated (i.v. via tail vein)
with PBS, ITEM-4, or with immunotoxins. Animals were monitored and tumors were measured every 2 to 3 days. Data are
presented as mean tumor volume (mm3)  SD. Survival was
calculated using a predeﬁned cutoff volume of 1,200 mm3 as a
surrogate for mortality (30). Average percentage weight change
was used as a surrogate endpoint for tolerability. Toxicity was
deﬁned as 20% or more of mice showing 20% or more body
weight loss and/or mortality.
Bioluminescence imaging
In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was conducted using
the IVIS 100 system with Living Image acquisition and analysis

www.aacrjournals.org

software (Caliper Life Sciences). Anesthetized mice were intraperitoneally injected with 75 mg/kg D-luciferin and imaged 10
minutes after luciferin injection.
Localization of hSGZ in tumor tissue
Twenty-four hours after i.v. injection of ITEM-4, ITEM4-rGel,
or hSGZ, the mice were sacriﬁced and tumor samples were
collected and frozen immediately for sectioning. Localization
of ITEM4-rGel and hSGZ in tumor tissues was conducted as
previously described (21).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism
with one-way ANOVA analysis, followed by Dunnet t test to
compare the tumor sizes between the control- and drugtreated groups. Survival comparisons between groups were
analyzed by log-rank test (GraphPad Prism 5). Differences
between groups were considered signiﬁcant when the P value
was 0.05 or less.

Results
Effect of hSGZ on breast tumor cell lines
MDA-MB-231 is a triple-negative human breast cancer cell
line that expresses relatively high levels of Fn14 (14). To
determine whether hSGZ could speciﬁcally internalize into
these cells, immunoﬂuorescence staining was conducted on
Fn14þ and Fn14 cells. Confocal microsopy images showed
that the rGel moiety of hSGZ was observed primarily in the
cytosol of Fn14-expressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
(Fig. 1A) and MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). We found no internalization in Fn14-deﬁcient MEF
3.5/ cells (data not shown).
Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with hSGZ has a comparative cytotoxicity to the parental immunoconjugate
ITEM4-rGel with an IC50 of 0.1 nmol/L, and this effect can
be completely abrogated by pretreatment with the mAb
ITEM-4 (Fig. 1B). Exposure to hSGZ for as short a period
as 1 hour, followed by drug removal and an additional 72hour incubation period, resulted in no signiﬁcant difference
in cytotoxicity compared with 72-hour exposure (Fig. 1C;
P > 0.05), indicating a rapid uptake mechanism. Additional
cytotoxicity assays using a panel of breast cancer cell lines,
which expressed different levels of Fn14, showed that hSGZ
was highly toxic to Fn14þ cells (IC50 ranged from 0.1 to 2.4
nmol/L) and 188- to 8,350-fold more potent than free rGel. In
contrast, hSGZ treatment had no signiﬁcant effect on Fn14
BT-474 and BT-474/HR (Herceptin-resistant) breast cancer
cells (Table 1) or Fn14-deﬁcient MEF 3.5/ cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We reported previously that hSGZ-mediated cytotoxicity in melanoma cells occurred via a necrotic
mechanism (21). Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells for 72
hours did not induce apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
To assess whether necrotic cell death was induced in breast
cancer cells, an LDH release assay was used (31). As shown in
Fig. 1D, treatment with hSGZ induced LDH release, which
was found to be both time- and dose-dependent and which is
consistent with a necrotic cell death mechanism.

Expression of P-gp encoded by the mdr1 gene is one of the
key molecules leading to resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents (32). To evaluate the effect of MDR1 expression on immunotoxin-induced cell killing, we compared the
sensitivities of MDA-MB-435/LCC6MDR1 and HeyA8-MDR cells
and their parental counterparts (MDA-MB-435 and HeyA8) to
Fn14-targeted immunotoxins. We also tested the activity of

(32, 33). As expected, paclitaxel and doxorubicin were less
potent in killing the P-gp–overexpressing human melanoma
MDA-MB-435/LCC6MDR1 cells and the paclitaxel-derived ovarian cancer HeyA8-MDR cells than in killing their corresponding
parental cells (Table 2). These results indicate that MDR1
activity limits the potency of these conventional cytotoxic
compounds. In contrast, the IC50s of ITEM4-rGel and hSGZ
on the MDR cells were similar to their parental cells (less than
1-fold for both MDR cell lines, respectively; Table 2), suggesting that rGel-based immunotoxins may be effective in overcoming MDR1-mediated MDR in cancer.

MCF7/HER2 cells, hSGZ signiﬁcantly suppressed HER3 and
Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner without
effecting HER2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). hSGZ treatment
also decreased the total level of HER3 in MCF7 cells but not
in MCF7/HER2 cells. Overexpression of HER2 in MCF7 cells
increased Fn14 expression as expected (34); however, treatment with hSGZ also dose-dependently increased Fn14 levels
(Fig. 2C), which is consistent with our previous report showing
that hSGZ can upregulate Fn14 expression (21). hSGZ treatment dose-dependently suppressed Erk2 and phospho-Erk1/2
levels (Fig. 2D). Treatment also increased both NF-kB p52 and
NF-kB p100 levels in both cell lines and decreased p27 levels
(Fig. 2D). This latter effect is probably due to a decrease in
regulatory, rapid-turnover proteins as a result of the overall
inhibition of protein synthesis by the rGel component of the
immunotoxin. These results indicate that the Fn14 receptor
may be an important downstream regulator of HER2/HER3
signaling in breast cancer cells and that hSGZ treatment can
suppress HER3/Akt activation in HER2-overexpressing cells.

hSGZ inhibits Erb3/Akt signaling in HER2overexpressing breast cancer cells
Fn14 and HER2 are frequently coexpressed in human breast
tumors (14, 23), and HER2 signaling in breast cancer cells
directly induces Fn14 gene expression (34). To determine if
HER2-induced upregulation of Fn14 expression would sensitize cells to hSGZ treatment, MCF7 and MCF7/HER2 cells were
exposed to hSGZ. Increased Fn14 protein expression by HER2
overexpression was conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 2A).
MCF7/HER2 cells were more sensitive to hSGZ treatment with
a 3.4-fold decreased IC50 dose compared with MCF7 cells (Fig.
2B). This ﬁnding suggests that induced overexpression of Fn14
by HER2 signaling could be translated to an improved therapeutic index with immunotoxin treatment.
The two most prevalent downstream signaling pathways
activated in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells are
the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. To further
understand the mechanism of action and potency of hSGZ on
HER2þ breast cancer cells, we explored the HER2 signaling
pathway in MCF7 and MCF7/HER2 cells in the absence or
presence of hSGZ. As shown in Fig. 2C, HER2 overexpression
induced robust phosphorylation of HER2, HER3 (ErbB3), and
Akt in MCF7 cells as assessed by Western blot analysis. In

HER2-overexpressing breast cancer (35, 36), on MCF7 and
MCF7/HER2 cells. As expected, treatment of HER2-negative
(HER2) MCF7 cells with 50 or 100 mg/mL of trastuzumab had
little effect on cell viability, and cotreatment with an IC25 dose
of hSGZ produced a cytotoxic effect similar to that of hSGZ
alone (Fig. 3A). In contrast, although 50 or 100 mg/mL of
trastuzumab had a marginal growth inhibition effect on
MCF7/HER2 cells, an IC25 dose of hSGZ, when combined with
50 or 100 mg/mL of trastuzumab, markedly increased its
cytotoxic effect to approximately 50% of viability (Fig. 3A).
hSGZ also potentiated the cytotoxic effect of trastuzumab on
SKBR3 breast cancer cells, which have high endogenous
expression levels of both the HER2 and Fn14 receptors (Fig.
3B). The data (Fig. 3B) suggest that simultaneous addition of
hSGZ and trastuzumab was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) more active
than either addition of hSGZ followed by trastuzumab, or
trastuzumab followed by hSGZ.
Pharmacokinetics of hSGZ
Pharmacokinetic data were obtained using hSGZ labeled
with the NIR dye 800CW (IR-hSGZ; Supplementary Fig. S3A)
after i.v. administration in mice. As shown in Fig. 4A, there was
a biexponential disposition of IR-hSGZ in the blood. Following
i.v. administration, IR-hSGZ had a rapid initial distribution to

a highly perfused, central compartment (mean t1/2 a ¼ 1.26
hours), followed by an extensive distribution to a second
tissue compartment (mean t1/2 b ¼ 7.29 hours), during which
the ﬂuorescent-conjugate spread from the central blood
compartment to the extravascular space of the solid tissues.
The initial concentration of IR-hSGZ in the plasma was 24.9 
2.9 mg/mL, which corresponded to the injected dose of the
drug. The pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized
in Fig. 4A, right.
Biodistribution of hSGZ
NIR images were taken at 24, 48, and 72 hours postinjection
of ﬂuorescent-labeled hSGZ into nude mice bearing MDA-MB231/Luc tumors and showed an accumulation of ﬂuorescence
in the organs and tumors (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S3B).
BLI imaging of the MDA-MB-231/Luc primary tumors corresponding to the NIR images of the same mice clearly showed
that the IR-hSGZ was colocalized in the tumor tissues (Fig. 4B).
To avoid any measuring errors caused by limited tissue penetration of ﬂuorophores, animals were sacriﬁced and tumor
and major organs were collected at the 24-, 48-, and 72-hour
time points and then subjected immediately to NIR imaging
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). The injected dose per gram (%ID/g)

studied (32.5%  3.9%, 27.7%  16.1%, and 9.2%  1.9% for 24,

showed decreased drug uptake over time. However, the tumors
showed the middle level of uptake among the tissues but with a
steady pattern over time (5.1%  0.5%, 4.8%  1.1%, and 4.7% 

accumulation in the tumor was further indicated by the
increasing tumor-to-muscle ratio post-IR-hSGZ injection over
time (Supplementary Fig. S3D; 5.6  1.3, 6.2  1.6, and 9.0  2.3

Efﬁcacy of hSGZ in breast cancer xenograft model
We next examined the effect of hSGZ on the growth of
established tumors using a MDA-MB-231/Luc xenograft model

of human breast cancer. Primary tumor sizes were assessed by
either caliper measurement or BLI imaging. A signiﬁcant
tumor growth inhibition was observed at both doses of the
hSGZ (25 or 36 mg/kg) as compared with saline control (P <
0.01; Fig. 5A). The tumors remained static for the entire study
period of more than 40 days in response to a dose of 36 mg/kg
for ITEM4-rGel (P ¼ 0.009; Fig. 5A). Mice treated with 36 mg/kg
of ITEM-4 plus rGel also had marginal tumor growth relative to
the saline control, but there was no signiﬁcant difference
between these two groups (P ¼ 0.06; on day 28). Survival in
the mice treated with ITEM4-rGel and hSGZ was signiﬁcantly
better than in those treated with saline or with ITEM-4 plus
rGel (P < 0.0001; Fig. 5B). Compared with animals in the saline
group, ITEM-4 plus rGel–treated mice showed a 48% increased
life span. The representative BLI images of the tumors on
selected days clearly showed the antitumor properties of the
ITEM4-rGel and hSGZ (Fig. 5C). Because the ITEM-4 antibody
can recognize murine Fn14, we were also able to assess

immunotoxin toxicity against normal mouse tissues. Toxicity
was monitored by frequent body weight measurements. The
mouse body weights showed less than a 20% change in any of
the treated or control groups over the duration of the experiment (Fig. 5D). We also found Fn14 was upregulated after
treatment with anti-Fn14 antibody ITEM-4 and ITEM4-based
immunotoxins (ITEM4-rGel and hSGZ) in vivo as assayed by
Western blot analysis of tumor tissues (Fig. 5E). Immunoﬂuorescence staining conﬁrmed that ITEM4-rGel and hSGZ localized speciﬁcally in tumor tissue, and no nonspeciﬁc staining
was observed in tumors after administration of ITEM-4 plus
rGel and saline detected by anti-rGel antibody (Supplementary

expression of Fn14 was found to be positively correlated with
metastasis, positive lymph nodes, and HER2þ/ER status,
which are three indicators of poor prognosis of patients with
breast cancer (14, 23). Our group recently showed that Fn14
was overexpressed in 173 of 190 (92%) of melanoma biopsy
specimens tested (21), suggesting that an anti-Fn14 approach
could also be useful for this tumor type. The differential
expression of Fn14 in HER2þ breast tumors compared with
normal tissue prompted us to test the Fn14-targeted immunotoxin hSGZ as an alternative antitumor strategy beyond
the currently used HER2-directed therapeutics trastuzumab
and lapatinib. Because the cytotoxic mechanism of hSGZ is
markedly distinct from that of these two agents, it is a potential
alternative for patients with HER2þ breast cancer resistant to
current therapeutic approaches.
The development of resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents through emergence of tumor cells expressing a MDR
phenotype (33) is a well-known and well-characterized
event. The P-gp transporter (MDR1)-mediated efﬂux of

have been documented for many cancer types (32, 37). The
results of the cytotoxicity studies indicate that the ITEM4-

MDR-1–overexpressing tumor cell lines (Table 2), supporting the possibility that rGel-based immunotoxins may be
effective in targeting solid tumors resistant to conventional

Zhou et al.

The members of the HER family (ErbB1/EGFR, ErbB2/HER2,
ErbB3, and ErbB4) of transmembrane proteins have been
ﬁrmly established as important drivers and therapeutic targets
in solid tumors (38, 39). Recently, Whitsett and colleagues (40)
reported that high Fn14 levels correlated with EGFR (HER1)
activation in non–small cell lung cancer specimens and cell
lines. In addition, the Fn14 and HER2 receptors are frequently
coexpressed in breast tumors (14, 23), and Fn14 is a HER2inducible gene (34). We report here that the increased Fn14
expression by HER2 signaling in MCF-7 cells could be translated to a better therapeutic index by targeting Fn14 when
using hSGZ (Fig. 2B). The correlation of Fn14 and ErbB family
member activation suggests that therapeutic targeting of Fn14
in tumors driven by oncogenic ErbB family members could
beneﬁt patients.
HER2/ErbB3 heterodimers have been found to be powerful
oncogene drivers, in part, because ErbB3 activation ampliﬁes
signaling through PI3K (41). It is thought that ErbB3 functions
primarily to drive HER2-mediated PI3K signaling (42, 43).
ErbB3 promotes HER2-induced changes in the breast epithelium before, during, and after tumor formation (44). Recent
studies suggest that HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancer cells use
HER3/ErbB3 to promote therapeutic resistance to HER2 inhibitors trastuzumab and the dual EGFR/ErbB2 tyrosine-kinase
inhibitor lapatinib (45).
Because ErbB2 inhibitors initially cause a decrease in PErbB3/PI3K signaling (46–48), many metastatic HER2-ampliﬁed breast cancers do not respond or eventually escape
trastuzumab- and lapatinib-mediated growth inhibition, often
with recovery of ErbB3/PI3K signaling (45). Thus, the HER3PI3K node is emerging as a potential target for anticancer
therapy (49, 50). Our study shows that targeting Fn14 by hSGZ
inhibits ErbB3/Akt signaling in HER2-overexpressing MCF-7
breast cancer cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that hSGZ
has the potential to overcome trastuzumab or lapatinib resistance in HER2þ breast tumors.
Clinical trials using pertuzumab and trastuzumab in combination with advanced HER2þ breast cancers have shown
signiﬁcant clinical activity (51). Thus, a rationale exists for
combining HER2-targeted agents with Fn14-targeted agents
such as hSGZ. Our studies on MCF/HER2 cells clearly show
that treatment with hSGZ augments the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
trastuzumab (Fig. 3). Furthermore, in vitro combination studies on MDA-MB-435 melanoma cells using hSGZ and several
standard chemotherapeutic agents also showed a synergistic
and/or additive cytotoxic effect (Supplementary Fig. S2). These
data suggest that consideration should be given to eventual
clinical trials with combinations of hSGZ and trastuzumab or
standard chemotherapeutic agents.
The pharmacokinetic data for IR-hSGZ were best characterized by biexponential kinetics with a rapid initial clearance
phase followed by a more prolonged clearance phase after i.v.
administration (Fig. 4A). The prolonged disposition of IR-hSGZ
in mice is likely attributable to the relatively large size of the
dimerized fusion protein (120 kDa). The prolonged circulation
of IR-hSGZ in blood allows for accumulation and retention
of the fusion protein in the tumor over time, as shown in the
NIR and BLI imaging study in mice bearing MDA-MB-231/Luc

4448

Cancer Res; 73(14) July 15, 2013

tumors (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S3). The tumor/muscle
ratio of hSGZ was shown to increase over time and reached the
highest level 72 hours after injection of the IR-hSGZ (Fig. 4C
and Supplementary Fig. S3D), which suggests that hSGZ was
efﬁciently delivered to the tumor site.
The biodistribution data obtained in our study should be
useful for determining dosing schedules, establishing efﬁcacy,
and predicting possible toxicity. As expected, the highest levels
of drug were found in highly perfused organs such as liver,
kidneys, and spleen (Fig. 4C). Retention in the liver may also
suggest that the liver may be involved in hSGZ metabolism, but
no overt toxicity was observed in mice even at the highest doses
used. It is important to note that the anti-Fn14 antibody used
for hSGZ construction cross-reacts with murine Fn14 receptors. Therefore, any toxicity observed is likely to be more
relevant to eventual clinical studies.
Our preclinical antitumor studies using a 5-day interval
treatment schedule based on pharmacokinetic and imaging
data showed therapeutic efﬁcacy of hSGZ in MDA-MB-231/Luc
tumors (Fig. 5). Consistent with our previous melanoma studies, we showed that ITEM4-rGel was more potent than hSGZ in
this breast cancer xenograft model. However, hSGZ showed
reduced systemic toxicity compared with ITEM4-rGel as
assessed by body weight measurements (Fig. 5D). Fn14 expression was upregulated by treatment with hSGZ in vitro (Fig. 2C)
and in vivo (Fig. 5E), which was consistent with our previous
results (21).
Recently, we reported phase I clinical studies of an rGel
immunoconjugate containing the anti-CD33 antibody
HuM195. These studies showed limited antigenicity and no
vascular leak issues with rGel-based therapeutics even after
repeated administration (52). These promising preclinical
activities of hSGZ will need to be conﬁrmed by clinical trials.
Overall, our data suggest that hSGZ is a potent anticancer
agent with a novel mechanism of action that might prove to
be effective against multiple Fn14þ tumor types resistant to
conventional agents.
