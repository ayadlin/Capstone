BACKGROUND: Mitoxantrone plus prednisone and ixabepilone each have modest activity as monotherapy for second-line chemotherapy in patients with docetaxel-refractory castration-resistant prostate cancer. Clinical noncrossresistance was previously observed. Phase 1 testing determined the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities with the combination regimen; a phase 2 study was conducted to evaluate the activity of the combination.
METHODS: Patients with metastatic progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer during or after 3 or more cycles
of taxane-based chemotherapy enrolled in a phase 2 multicenter study of ixabepilone 35 mg/m2 and mitoxantrone 12
mg/m2 administered on Day 1 every 21 days with pegfilgrastim support, along with prednisone 5 mg twice daily.
Patients were evaluated for disease response and toxicity. RESULTS: Results are reported for the 56 evaluable
patients. Twenty-five (45%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31%-59%) experienced confirmed 50% prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) declines, 33 (59%; 95% CI, 45%-72%) experienced confirmed 30% PSA declines, and 8 of 36 patients
(22%; 95% CI, 10%-39%) with measurable disease experienced objective responses. Median time to PSA or objective
progression was 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.5-5.6), and median progression-free survival was also 4.4 months (95% CI,
3.0-6.0). Median overall survival was 12.5 months (95% CI, 10.2-15.9). Thirty-two percent of patients experienced grade
3 of 4 neutropenia, and 11% experienced grade 3 or higher neutropenic infections, including 1 treatment-related death.
Grade 2 and 3 neuropathy occurred in 11% and 12.5% of patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest
that the combination of ixabepilone and mitoxantrone is both feasible and active in castration-resistant prostate

Mortality in prostate cancer is primarily related to the development of metastatic castration-resistant disease, and

options after docetaxel, the first-line standard of care, remain limited.1 Recent data have established cabazitaxel as the
standard second-line therapy.2 Mitoxantrone with prednisone, which has been demonstrated to improve quality of life
as front-line therapy, has been used extensively, with 50% PSA declines reported in 20% of patients previously treated
with docetaxel.3-5 Ixabepilone, an epothilone analog, has similarly been demonstrated to have a 17% response rate in this
setting. Of interest, objective responses to mitoxantrone/prednisone after second-line ixabepilone and conversely to
ixabepilone after second-line mitoxantrone/prednisone were observed during a randomized phase 2 study, suggesting
there is noncross-resistance with the 2 regimens.
On the basis of the nonoverlapping toxicity of these regimens and their apparent noncross-resistance, a phase 1 study
combining these agents was undertaken in patients previously treated with docetaxel.6 The combination was well

tolerated. Although hematologic toxicity required treatment with pegfilgrastim, other toxicity, including neurotoxicity, was modest. The regimen recommended for
phase 2 testing was mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 and ixabepilone 35 mg/m2, given with prednisone 5 mg twice daily,
along with pegfilgrastim 6 mg on Day 2. Responses, as
defined by a 50% PSA decline, were observed in 31% of
patients, with objective responses in 2 of 36 patients in the
phase 1 study. When limited to the 21 patients treated
with 12 mg/m2 of mitoxantrone plus ixabepilone at a
dose of 30 mg/m2 or higher, 43% of patients experienced
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) declines of 50% (95%
confidence interval [CI], 22% to 66%). When compared
with the response proportions reported for monotherapy
with either ixabepilone or mitoxantrone of approximately
20%, these results suggested at least additive effects of the
2 agents and were sufficiently promising to warrant a
phase 2 study to determine the activity of this novel
regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This study was a multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 study of
ixabepilone and mitoxantrone with prednisone in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who developed
progressive disease during or after docetaxel-based chemotherapy. This study was undertaken in the Department of
Defense Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium,
with accrual occurring at 6 academic centers. The primary
endpoint of the study was the proportion of patients
achieving 50% PSA declines. Secondary endpoints
included overall safety, the frequency of objective
responses, time to progression, progression-free survival,
and overall survival. This study was approved by the Clinical Trial Evaluation Program of the National Cancer
Institute, the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium
Review Committee, and the local institutional review
boards of participating institutions. All patients provided
written informed consent.
Eligibility
Patients were required to have histologically confirmed
prostate cancer with metastatic spread and progressive
disease despite castrate testosterone levels. Patients were
required to have received at least 3 cycles of taxane-based
chemotherapy, and only 1 prior chemotherapy regimen
was permitted. For patients with measurable disease, progression was defined according to Response Evaluation

2420

Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and for patients
without measurable disease, a PSA of 2 ng/mL and a
bone scan consistent with metastasis were required.
Patients without measurable disease were required to have
either PSA progression or a bone scan demonstrating 1 or
more new metastatic lesions. PSA progression was defined
according to PSA Working Group 1 criteria.7 Patients
were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2 and grade
1 peripheral neuropathy (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version
3.0). Patients who had not undergone prior orchiectomy
were required to remain on a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist. Other hormonal therapy, with the
exception of prednisone 5 mg twice daily, as given with
docetaxel, was not allowed within 4 weeks of study entry.
Docetaxel was not allowed within 4 weeks of enrollment.
No prior mitoxantrone or ixabepilone was allowed. Radiation or radiopharmaceutical therapy must have been
completed at least 4 and 8 weeks, respectively, before
enrollment. Cardiac ejection fraction was required to be
above the lower limit of normal for the institution.
Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease,
including New York Heart Association class III or IV
heart failure, active angina, or a history of myocardial infarction within 6 months, were excluded. Laboratory
requirements included testosterone <50 ng/dL; creatinine
1.5  upper limit of normal (ULN) or calculated creatinine clearance 40 mL/min; alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) <2.5 
ULN; granulocytes 2000/mm3; platelets 100,000/
mm3; and total bilirubin 1.5  ULN. Because ixabepilone is a CYP3A4 substrate, concurrent use of moderate
to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors was prohibited.
Study Therapy
Patients were treated on day 1 of 21-day cycles. Premedication with oral H1- and H2-blockers was administered
1 hour before treatment to prevent hypersensitivity reactions. Patients received mitoxantrone 12 mg/m2 intravenously over 30 minutes. Ixabepilone 35 mg/m2 was
subsequently administered as a continuous infusion over
3 hours. Patients were monitored for hypersensitivity
reactions for 1 hour. If grade 2 to 4 hypersensitivity reactions developed despite antihistamine premedication,
corticosteroid premedication was used for subsequent
cycles. Prednisone was administered 5 mg twice daily
continuously. Pegfilgrastim 6 mg was administered subcutaneously on Day 2. Patients were treated until disease

progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient preference
to discontinue therapy.
Assessment for Response and Toxicity
Patients were assessed with chest x-ray or chest computed
tomography (CT), CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and
bone scan every 3 cycles. PSA, complete blood count with
differential and platelets, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen,
creatinine, magnesium, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin,
AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were
obtained every cycle. Physical examination and assessment
of performance status were undertaken each cycle. Echocardiogram or MUGA (Multi Gated Acquisition) Scan
was performed at baseline, every 3 cycles, and as clinically
indicated.
Objective response was defined by RECIST, and
both 50% and 30% PSA declines were determined, with a
repeat PSA required 3 weeks later for confirmation.7,8
Disease progression was defined as new metastases outside
of the bone, 1 new bone lesions confirmed on repeat
imaging, a need for radiation while on therapy, unequivocal progression of nontarget lesions, progression by
RECIST, or PSA progression. PSA progression was
defined according to PSA Working Group 1 criteria, with
a PSA increase of 25% above the nadir value, occurring at
least 9 weeks (3 cycles) after initiating the study.
Toxicity was monitored by history, physical examination, and laboratory assessment before each cycle.
Adverse events were graded according to National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. For
grade 3 or higher toxicities, both ixabepilone and mitoxantrone were held until resolution to grade 1, then
reinstituted at 5 mg/m2 less of ixabepilone and 2 mg/m2
less of mitoxantrone. The same process was required for
recurrent toxicities, with a third recurrence resulting in
removal from study therapy. For corticosteroid toxicity,
prednisone doses could be modified without removing a
patient from protocol therapy. For neurotoxicity secondary to ixabepilone, therapy was held for grade 2 or 3
toxicity but otherwise managed as above. Alopecia, lymphopenia, anemia, and toxicities related to androgen deprivation were excluded as dose-limiting or modifying
criteria.
Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of
patients responding to treatment defined as observing a
PSA decline of 50% (PSA response) based on PSA
Working Group 1 criteria. Treatment of 58 patients

allowed for the detection of a PSA response proportion of
35%, compared with a null hypothesis of 20% with a
power of 0.90 and a level of significance of 0.10. Simonâ€™s
MiniMax 2-stage design was used for accrual, to allow for
an interim analysis for efficacy after the first 33 patients
had been accrued and had been followed for 3 cycles of
treatment. Had 6 or fewer of the first 33 patients enrolled
demonstrated a PSA decline of 50%, accrual would
have been terminated, resulting in a probability of early
termination if the null hypothesis were true of 50%.
Objective responses were evaluated according to RECIST
for patients with measurable disease. Descriptive statistics
were calculated to characterize the patient cohort, baseline
disease parameters, outcome, and toxicity. The time to
progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival
were measured from the start of protocol therapy and
evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between November 2007 and March 2009, 58 patients
were enrolled at 6 member institutions of the Department
of Defense Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium.
Two patients were ineligible: 1 because of pre-existing
spinal cord compression and 1 because of a secondary diagnosis of colon cancer diagnosed after 2 cycles of therapy;
therefore, 56 evaluable patients were included in these
analyses. Four patients did not complete the minimum
3 cycles of therapy defined by the protocol to be necessary
for response assessment; 2 discontinued for progressive
disease and 2 withdrew because of concerns over rising
PSA. These 4 patients are included in both efficacy and
toxicity analyses. Patient characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. The median age of patients at the start of protocol therapy was 66.7 years. Sixty-nine percent of patients
had a Gleason score of 8 to 10. Sixty-six percent had an
ECOG performance status of 1 to 2, and 34% had an
ECOG performance status of 0. The median PSA was
171.2 (range, 2.79-3717.1), and the median alkaline
phosphatase was 134 (range, 42-1094). All patients had
received prior docetaxel therapy once every 3 weeks. The
median number of prior chemotherapy cycles was 8
(range, 3-33). The median prior treatment duration was
6.4 months (range, 2.2-29.1), and the median time
between discontinuation of docetaxel and initiation of
study therapy was 53 days (range, 5-413). Fifty percent of
patients (28 of 56) had experienced a PSA response to
prior taxane-based therapy by PSA Working Group 1

9% stopped docetaxel therapy for toxicity, and 2%
stopped with stable disease after completing a planned
course of therapy. Thus, 89% of patients had developed
docetaxel-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer

ble patients (Table 2). Overall, 25 (45%) patients experienced confirmed PSA declines of 50% (Fig. 1; 95% CI,
31%-59%), and 33 (59%) had confirmed PSA declines of
30% (95% CI, 45%-72%). After 12 weeks of protocol
therapy, 30% of the patients achieved PSA declines of at
least 50%, indicating that the study null hypothesis of
20% can be rejected (1-sided binomial exact test: P Â¼
.04). Partial objective RECIST-defined responses were
observed in 8 patients of 36 with measurable disease
(22%; 95% CI, 10%-39%).
With a median follow-up of 9.9 months (range, 3.119.4) from the start of protocol therapy, the median time
to progression was 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.5-5.6). The
median PSA or objective progression-free survival was
also 4.4 months (Fig. 2; 95% CI, 3.0-6.0), and the
median overall survival was 12.5 months (Fig. 3; 95% CI,
10.2-15.9).
Patients with a prior response to docetaxel therapy
were as likely to respond to ixabepilone and mitoxantrone
with prednisone second-line therapy as patients with no
prior response to docetaxel. Of the 28 patients who had a

had a 50% PSA decline with ixabepilone and mitoxantrone with prednisone. Of the 10 patients whose best

and 1 because of a combination of toxicity and concerns
over rising PSA. One (2%) patient remains on therapy
10.6 months from the start of protocol therapy having

DISCUSSION
After progression on docetaxel-based chemotherapy,
chemotherapy options for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remain poor. Recently
reported data suggest that cabazitaxel may represent an
important therapeutic option for patients with progressive
disease after docetaxel.2 Mitoxantrone with prednisone is
often used as second-line therapy but is associated with a
PSA response rate of only 20%.5 Ixabepilone also has a
disappointing PSA response rate of 17% after docetaxel.
The objective response rates associated with ixabepilone
monotherapy and mitoxantrone with prednisone after
docetaxel are also low at 4% and 10%, respectively. On
the basis of results from a randomized phase 2 study
suggesting that ixabepilone and mitoxantrone with
prednisone have noncross-resistance and a phase 1 trial of
the ixabepilone and mitoxantrone with prednisone
combination demonstrating surprisingly high activity, the
present phase 2 trial was undertaken.5
The ixabepilone and mitoxantrone with prednisone
regimen was found to have significant activity, with a PSA
response proportion of 45%, and an equally promising
objective response proportion of 22%. The overall survival in this group of patients was 12.5 months. Although
direct comparisons are not possible across studies, and
differences in patient populations may account for results
observed, it is notable that the overall survival was 10.4
months on the ixabepilone arm (with mitoxantrone on
progression) and 9.8 months on the mitoxantrone arm
(with ixabepilone on progression) in the randomized
phase 2 study of ixabepilone or mitoxantrone after
docetaxel. The time to progression of 4.4 months also
appears favorable in comparison to the 2.3-month time
to progression on mitoxantrone monotherapy in the
randomized phase 2 study.
Data from a randomized phase 3 study comparing
cabazitaxel to mitoxantrone with prednisone in patients
who had progressed after docetaxel-based therapy indicated that cabazitaxel was associated with a PSA response
proportion of 39%, in comparison to 18% on the mitoxantrone/prednisone arm. Although these results cannot be
directly compared with the results of the current study of
ixabepilone with mitoxantrone and prednisone, the
response proportion of 45% in the current study suggests
further study may be warranted.
Of interest, response to ixabepilone and mitoxantrone with prednisone does not appear to be dependent
on prior response to docetaxel. Although definitive conclusions cannot be drawn given the small numbers of

2424

patients, these data suggest that there is no significant
cross-resistance between docetaxel and ixabepilone/mitoxantrone with prednisone, and that ixabepilone and
mitoxantrone with prednisone therapy may be useful in
patients with progressive disease after docetaxel, regardless
of docetaxel sensitivity.
The combination of these 2 agents did not appear to
result in a dramatic increase in toxicity. Although comparison across studies is fraught with difficulty, toxicity with the
study regimen appears to be similar to that associated with
mitoxantrone/prednisone use in the second-line alone. In
the randomized phase 2 study of mitoxantrone/prednisone
and ixabepilone monotherapy, 10% of the 41 patients on
the mitoxantrone/prednisone second-line arm experienced
febrile neutropenia, and 9% of the 56 patients on this study
of the combination (with pegfilgrastim support) experienced febrile neutropenia. It is important to note, however,
that this margin of safety can be achieved with the ixabepilone and mitoxantrone with prednisone regimen at the
doses studied only with pegfilgrastim support.
Sixteen percent of patients discontinued therapy for
toxicity in this phase 2 study of the combination, a number that appears to be similar to the number of patients
discontinuing docetaxel as first-line treatment for toxicity.
In the randomized phase 2 study of mitoxantrone or
ixabepilone, 10% of the 41 patients on mitoxantrone
discontinued therapy for toxicity.1
Nonhematologic toxicity was minimal. Despite substantial doses of mitoxantrone (66% of patients received
>6 cycles), minimal cardiac toxicity was observed. Similarly, less neuropathy was observed than expected in this
taxane-pretreated population, with 11% and 12.5% of
patients developing grade 2 and 3 neurotoxicity, respectively. However, these results may reflect patient selection.
As with the prior second-line ixabepilone prostate cancer
studies, patients with grade 2 or higher neuropathy at
baseline after docetaxel were excluded. This may have
selected a patient population less likely to experience
neuropathy. Nevertheless, neuropathy was comparable to
that seen in breast cancer studies9-13 in which 12% to
20% of patients develop grade 3 neurotoxicity.
One potential weakness of this study is that the
eligibility criteria did not require a previous history of progression while receiving docetaxel-based therapy, but
rather required disease progression during or after docetaxel therapy, possibly selecting for a more chemotherapysensitive population. However, 89% of the patients on
study had, in fact, progressed while receiving docetaxel
therapy, suggesting that this study enrolled patients with

Cancer

docetaxel resistance. Furthermore, there did not appear to
be a difference in response proportion as a function of
prior response to docetaxel, although small numbers limit
this analysis.
Another potential criticism of this study is that the primary endpoint, the proportion of patients achieving a
50% decline in PSA, per PSA Working Group Criteria, is
of uncertain clinical significance. However, the PSA Working Group criteria were initially established to be used specifically in this setting, as a screen for the activity of
cytotoxic agents in the phase 2 setting.7 In addition, the
objective response proportion, time to progression, and
overall survival observed with ixabepilone and mitoxantrone
with prednisone therapy all appeared to be favorable compared with that associated with mitoxantrone monotherapy,
suggesting that the high proportion of patients with an
observed PSA decline may be associated with improved survival outcomes. Definitive evidence of benefit can only be
established by evaluating overall survival in a phase 3 study.
In summary, the combination of ixabepilone and
mitoxantrone with prednisone appears to have greater activity than either mitoxantrone or ixabepilone alone in the second-line setting for castration-resistant prostate cancer, and
suggests at least additive if not synergistic activity in a disease
state where improvement in outcome is needed and long
overdue. The combination is well tolerated, although some
hematologic toxicity is present and dosing with pegfilgrastim is required. The results of this study suggest that it is
appropriate to study further the ixabepilone and mitoxantrone with prednisone regimen in patients with docetaxelresistant castration-resistant prostate cancer.
