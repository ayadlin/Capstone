Abstract
Cannabinoids, the active components of Cannabis sativa L.
and their derivatives, inhibit tumor growth in laboratory
animals by inducing apoptosis of tumor cells and impairing
tumor angiogenesis. It has also been reported that these
compounds inhibit tumor cell spreading, but the molecular
targets of this cannabinoid action remain elusive. Here, we
evaluated the effect of cannabinoids on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and its effect on tumor cell
invasion. Local administration of #9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), the major active ingredient of cannabis, downregulated MMP-2 expression in gliomas generated in mice,
as determined by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and
real-time quantitative PCR analyses. This cannabinoidinduced inhibition of MMP-2 expression in gliomas (a) was
MMP-2–selective, as levels of other MMP family members were
unaffected; (b) was mimicked by JWH-133, a CB2 cannabinoid
receptor–selective agonist that is devoid of psychoactive side
effects; (c) was abrogated by fumonisin B1, a selective
inhibitor of ceramide biosynthesis; and (d) was also evident
in two patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. THC
inhibited MMP-2 expression and cell invasion in cultured
glioma cells. Manipulation of MMP-2 expression by RNA
interference and cDNA overexpression experiments proved
that down-regulation of this MMP plays a critical role in THCmediated inhibition of cell invasion. Cannabinoid-induced
inhibition of MMP-2 expression and cell invasion was
prevented by blocking ceramide biosynthesis and by knocking-down the expression of the stress protein p8. As MMP-2
up-regulation is associated with high progression and poor
prognosis of gliomas and many other tumors, MMP-2 downregulation constitutes a new hallmark of cannabinoid antitumoral activity. [Cancer Res 2008;68(6):1945–52]

Introduction
Cannabinoids, the active components of Cannabis sativa L.
(marijuana) and their derivatives, exert a wide array of effects by
activating specific receptors that are normally engaged by a family
of endogenous ligands—the endocannabinoids (1, 2). Cannabis
preparations have been used in medicine for centuries, and
nowadays, there is a renaissance in the study of their therapeutic
effects (3, 4). Specifically, cannabinoids have been known to exert

palliative effects in patients with cancer since the early 1970s. The
best established of these effects is the inhibition of chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting, and so capsules of D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major active component of cannabis, and its
synthetic analogue nabilone are currently approved for that
purpose (5, 6). In addition, several clinical trials are testing other
potential palliative properties of cannabinoids in oncology such
as appetite stimulation and pain inhibition (5, 6). Besides these
palliative actions, cannabinoids have been proposed as potential
antitumoral agents owing to their ability to inhibit the growth and
angiogenesis of various types of tumor xenografts in animal models
(5). Studies on malignant gliomas and other models of cancer
strongly support the conclusion that cannabinoids decrease tumor
progression by at least two mechanisms: the apoptotic death of
tumor cells (7–10) and the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis
(8, 11–14). It has also been reported that cannabinoids inhibit
tumor cell migration and spreading (12, 15–18). However, the
molecular targets of this cannabinoid effect remain elusive. Among
the different factors involved in the acquisition of invasive
capacities by tumor cells, the action of matrix metalloproteinases
(MMP) plays a pivotal role. MMPs have long been linked to tumor
invasion owing to their crucial involvement in the breakdown of
the extracellular matrix and in the proteolytic activation of various
classes of tumor progression factors. Accordingly, increased
expression and activation of MMPs are found in almost every type
of human cancer compared with normal tissue, and this has been
associated with poor patient prognosis (19–21). This background
prompted us to study the effect of cannabinoid administration
on MMP expression by tumor cells and its effect on tumor cell
invasion. Here, we report that cannabinoid administration inhibits
MMP-2 expression in cultured glioma cells, in mice bearing
gliomas, and in two patients with glioblastoma multiforme. We also
show that down-regulation of MMP-2 expression underlies
cannabinoid-induced inhibition of glioma cell invasion and is
mediated by the sphingolipid ceramide and the stress protein p8,
two key signaling elements of cannabinoid antitumoral action (10).

Materials and Methods
Cannabinoids. The cannabinoid agonists THC, JWH-133, and anandamide were kindly given by Alfredo Dupetit (The Health Concept,
Richelbach, Germany), John W. Huffman (Department of Chemistry,
Clemson University, South Carolina), and Daniele Piomelli (University of
California, Irvine, Irvine CA), respectively. The cannabinoid antagonists
SR141716 and SR144528 were kindly given by Sanofi-Aventis (Montpellier,
France). For in vitro incubations, ligands were directly applied at a final
DMSO concentration of 0.1% to 0.2% (v/v). For in vivo administration to
mice, cannabinoids were prepared at 1% (v/v) DMSO in 100 AL of PBS
supplemented with 5 mg/mL of bovine serum albumin. No significant
influence of the vehicle was observed on any of the variables determined.
The preparation of THC for administration to patients is described below.

Cell culture. The rat C6.9 and C6.4 glioma cell lines were cultured in
Ham’s F12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The human SW1088,
T98 G, U87 MG, and U118 MG astrocytoma cell lines were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Twenty-four hours before the
experiments, cells were transferred to their respective serum-free media.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (11) and rat cortical astrocytes (10)
were isolated and cultured as described before.
Cell invasion assay. Cell invasion was monitored by using cell culture
inserts (BD Biosciences). After exposure to different stimuli, cells were
trypsinized, washed, resuspended in DMEM, and loaded into the insert.
DMEM supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum was placed in the plate
well as a cell migration stimulus. Cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h (C6.9
and C6.4 cells) or 6 h (U87 MG cells) at 37jC through an 8-Am polyethylene
terephthalate track-etched membrane that had been precoated with
Matrigel basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences) at 9.6 mg/mL and
subsequently blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Then, cells
from the upper side of the membrane were removed, and the remaining
cells on the bottom side of the membrane were fixed with 70% ethanol,
stained with crystal violet, and counted.
Tumor generation in mice. Tumors were generated in immunodeficient
mice by subcutaneous flank inoculation of 5  106 C6.9 or C6.4 glioma cells
in 100 AL of PBS supplemented with 0.1% glucose. When tumors reached a

volume of 300 to 400 mm3, animals were assigned randomly to the various
groups and injected peritumorally (at f2 mm from the tumor) for 8 days
with 500 Ag/d of THC, 50 Ag/d of JWH-133, and/or 60 Ag/d of fumonisin
B1 (Alexis). Control animals were injected with vehicle. Tumors were
measured with an external caliper and volume was calculated as (4 p/3) 
(width/2)2  (length/2).
Human tumor samples. Tumor biopsies were obtained from two
recurrent patients with glioblastoma multiforme who had been treated with
THC. The characteristics of the patients and the clinical study have been
described in detail elsewhere (22). Briefly, each day, an aliquot of THC
(100 mg/mL in ethanol) was dissolved in 30 mL of physiologic saline
solution supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) human serum albumin and the
resulting solution was administered intratumorally to the patients. Patient 1
received a total of 1.46 mg of THC for 30 days, whereas patient 2 received
a total of 1.29 mg of THC for 26 days. Samples were either frozen ( for
Western blotting) or fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin ( for
immunomicroscopy).
Western blot analysis. Particulate tissue fractions were subjected to
SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred from the gels onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes. The blots were incubated with antibodies raised
against different MMPs and a-tubulin was used as a loading control
(Supplementary Table S1). In all cases, samples were subjected to

luminography with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit
(Amersham Life Sciences). Densitometric analysis of the blots was done
with Kodak Molecular Imaging Software 4.0 in a Kodak Image Station
4000 MM.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Mouse tumors were dissected and
frozen, and sections were fixed in acetone for 10 min. Human tumors
were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and then paraffin-embedded. Sections
(5 Am) were stained with anti-rat MMP-2 (1:200; Torrey Pines Biolabs) or
anti–MMP-2 (1:200; Chemicon) antibody as described (13). Sections were
mounted with Mowiol mounting medium (Merck) containing TOTO-3
iodide (1:1,000; Molecular Probes) to stain cell nuclei. Fluorescence images
were acquired using Metamorph-Offline 6.2 software (Universal Imaging)
and Zeiss Axioplan 2 Microscope. Pixel quantification was obtained from
the analysis of 5 to 10 fields chosen randomly from three to four sections
per tumor. Fluorescence thresholds were set at 75 (low threshold) and
255 (high threshold).
Real-time quantitative PCR. RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen) including a DNase digestion step using the Real Star Kit
(Durviz). cDNA was obtained with Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase
(Roche Applied Science). Real-time quantitative PCR assays were done
using the FastStart Master Mix with Rox (Roche Applied Science) and
probes were obtained from the Universal Probe Library Set (Roche Applied
Science). The primers used are shown in Supplementary Table S2.
Amplifications were run in a 7900 HT-Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems). Each value was adjusted by using 18S RNA levels as reference.
RNA interference. U87 MG astrocytoma cells were transfected with
small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes using the DharmaFECT 1
transfection reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Four different double-stranded RNA duplexes corresponding
to hMMP2, hMMP3, hMMP9, and hMMP14 (ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool
L-005959-00-0010, L-005968-00, L-005970-00, and L-004145-00, respectively)
and double-stranded RNA duplexes corresponding to hEGR1 (VELGA000007) were from Dharmacon. Double-stranded RNA duplexes
corresponding to human p8 (5¶-GGAGGACCCAGGACAGGAU-3¶) and a
nontargeted control (5¶-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3¶) were from Eurogentec. Double-stranded RNA corresponding to hATF3 was purchased from
Roche Applied Science; it was obtained from the esiWay Resource
RZPDp3000C1214D and then synthesized using the X-tremeGENE siRNA
Dicer Kit (Roche Applied Science). Transfection efficiency was >80%, as
monitored by using a control fluorescent siRNA (siGLO RISC-Free siRNA
D-001600-01-20; Dharmacon).
MMP-2 overexpression. pbluescript KS-hMMP2 was kindly provided
by Barry L. Marmer (Department of Medicine, Washington University
School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). hMMP2 cDNA was obtained from this
construct by PCR to add an EcoRI site at 5¶ (5¶-TTAGAATTCATGGAGGCGCTAATGGCCCGG-3¶) and a NotI site at 3¶ (5¶-ATTGCGGCCGCTCAGCAGCCTAGCCAGTCGGAT-3¶), and was subsequently cloned into a

Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and
seeded at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2. Cells were transferred to a serum-free
medium 18 h before performing the different treatments. Transfection
efficiency was >70% as monitored by using a green fluorescent protein–

using the human MMP-2 Biotrack ELISA System (Amersham).
Statistics. The results shown represent mean F SD. Statistical analysis
was performed by ANOVA with a post hoc analysis using the StudentNeuman-Keuls test or by unpaired Student’s t test.

Results
THC inhibits MMP-2 expression in mouse gliomas. To test
whether cannabinoid administration affects MMP levels, we
generated subcutaneous gliomas in mice. The specificity of
cannabinoid action was ascertained by the parallel study of C6.9
and C6.4 glioma cells, which constitute well-established models
of cannabinoid-responsive and cannabinoid-resistant cells, respectively (7, 10, 23). Tumors were treated with either vehicle or THC
and MMP levels were determined by Western blot. Cannabinoid
administration decreased tumor growth (Fig. 1A) and MMP-2
expression (Fig. 1B) in C6.9-cell gliomas. The effect seemed to
be MMP family member–selective as THC did not reduce the
expression of MMP-3, MMP-9, and MT1-MMP (MMP-14), which
have been also associated with glioma invasion and progression
(24–26). The levels of other MMPs (MMP-1, MMP-8, MMP-10, and
MMP-13) remained unchanged as well (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
In contrast with C6.9-cell gliomas, neither tumor growth (Fig. 1A)
nor MMP-2 expression (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1A) were
affected by THC treatment in C6.4-cell gliomas. Immunofluorescence microscopy experiments confirmed the cannabinoid-induced
decrease of MMP-2 levels in the cannabinoid-sensitive but not in
the cannabinoid-resistant tumors (Fig. 1C). Evaluation of MMP
mRNA levels by real-time quantitative PCR provided further
evidence for the selective down-regulation of MMP-2 in THCtreated C6.9-cell gliomas (Fig. 1D).
THC inhibits MMP-2 expression in two patients with
glioblastoma multiforme. To obtain further support for the
potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid-induced down-regulation of MMP-2 expression, we analyzed tumor samples from two

patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (22). The patients
were subjected to local THC administration and biopsies were
taken before and after treatments. Immunomicroscopy analysis
showed that tumor MMP-2 levels were lower after cannabinoid
delivery in both patients (Fig. 2A). This was confirmed by Western
blot analysis in tumor biopsies from patient 1, in which the levels
of other MMPs remained unchanged (Fig. 2B; Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain appropriate
samples for Western blotting from patient 2.
The CB2 receptor agonist JWH-133 inhibits MMP-2 expression in mouse gliomas. Because cannabinoid-based therapeutic
strategies should be as devoid as possible of psychotropic effects,
which are mediated by brain CB1 receptors (3, 4), and gliomas
express functional CB2 receptors (7), which are not linked to
cannabinoid psychoactivity, we gave mice JWH-133, a CB2 receptorselective agonist that exerts antitumoral activity without overt
psychoactive side effects (27). JWH-133 decreased tumor growth
(Fig. 3A) and MMP-2 expression in glioma xenografts, as determined by both Western blot (Fig. 3B) and immunomicroscopy
analyses (Fig. 3C). The levels of the other MMPs remained
unchanged upon JWH-133 treatment (Fig. 3B).
The ceramide biosynthesis inhibitor fumonisin B1 prevents
JWH-133–induced MMP-2 down-regulation in mouse gliomas.

The sphingolipid messenger ceramide has been implicated in the
regulation of tumor growth and angiogenesis by cannabinoids
(7, 10, 13). The involvement of ceramide in cannabinoid-induced
inhibition of MMP-2 expression was thus tested by the use of
fumonisin B1, a selective inhibitor of sphingolipid biosynthesis that
is widely used to depress ceramide levels in vivo and that prevents
cannabinoid-induced ceramide accumulation in glioma cells (13).
Fumonisin B1 abrogated the inhibitory action of JWH-133 on
tumor growth (Fig. 3A). In addition, the decrease in MMP-2 levels
induced by cannabinoid administration was prevented by cotreatment of the animals with fumonisin B1, as determined by both
Western blot (Fig. 3B) and immunomicroscopy analyses (Fig. 3C).
THC inhibits MMP-2 expression in cultured glioma cells. To
test whether the cannabinoid-induced down-regulation of MMP-2
expression observed in vivo reflects the direct effect of cannabinoids on tumor cells, we conducted cell culture experiments. The
cannabinoid did not significantly affect cell viability throughout
the time interval in which MMP-2 determinations were performed
(data not shown). In line with the aforementioned in vivo
observations, THC decreased MMP-2 mRNA levels in cultures of
C6.9 cells but not of C6.4 cells (Fig. 4A). Cannabinoid-induced
inhibition of MMP-2 expression was also evident in a number of
human glioma cell lines (astrocytomas SW1088, T98 G, U87 MG,

and U118 MG; Fig. 4B), but not in primary cultures of normal,
nontransformed rat astroglial cells (data not shown). The use of
the CB1-selective antagonist SR141716 and the CB2-selective
antagonist SR144528 supported the assumption that THC acts on
U87 MG cells mostly via CB2 receptors, although the contribution
of CB1 receptors should not be ruled out (Fig. 4C). ELISA
determinations showed that THC also decreased MMP-2 protein
levels in U87 MG cells (Fig. 4D). However, challenge with THC at
1.5 Amol/L for 24, 48, or 72 hours did not significantly affect MMP-2
levels in human umbilical vascular endothelial cell cultures (data
not shown), in contrast with a previous report showing decreased
MMP-2 activity upon exposure of these cells to the endocannabinoid analogue, 2-methyl-2¶-F-anandamide at 10 Amol/L for
24 hours (14). We tested the effect of the natural endocannabinoid
anandamide in our U87 MG-cell system and found that this
compound was highly cytotoxic at 10 Amol/L for 24 hours. At
5 Amol/L for 24 hours, it did not affect cell viability and decreased
MMP-2 expression to 68 F 19% of vehicle-treated cells (n = 3;
P < 0.05), but this effect was not prevented by SR141716 or
SR144528, either alone or in combination (data not shown),
pointing to a CB receptor–independent action.
MMP-2 down-regulation is involved in THC-induced inhibition of glioma cell invasion. As MMP-2 is involved in the
acquisition of highly invasive characteristics by different types of
tumor cells, including glioma cells (19, 25, 28), we next examined
whether cannabinoids modulate glioma cell invasion. THC
inhibited the invasion of C6.9 and U87 MG cells but not of C6.4
cells (Fig. 5A). Of interest, both cannabinoid-sensitive and
cannabinoid-resistant cells were equally affected by the broadspectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 and the MMP-2/MMP-9–

selective inhibitor 5 (Fig. 5A; ref. 29). To further test the
involvement of MMP-2 in THC-mediated depression of glioma
cell invasion, we manipulated cellular MMP-2 mRNA levels. On the
one hand, transfection of U87 MG cells with a MMP-2–directed
siRNA (which diminished MMP-2 mRNA levels to 26 F 11% of
control siRNA-transfected cells; n = 3, P < 0.05) decreased basal
cell invasion and abrogated THC-inhibited cell invasion (Fig. 5B,
left). On the other hand, transfection of U87 MG cells with a
MMP-2–expressing vector (which increased MMP-2 mRNA levels to
236 F 42% of control vector–transfected cells; n = 3, P < 0.01)
slightly—although not significantly—stimulated basal cell invasion
and abrogated THC-inhibited cell invasion (Fig. 5B, right). The
selective involvement of MMP-2 down-regulation in the action of
THC was supported by the observation that transfection of U87
MG cells with either a MMP-3–directed siRNA (which diminished
MMP-3 mRNA levels to 12 F 6% of control siRNA-transfected
cells; n = 2, P < 0.01), a MMP-9–directed siRNA (which diminished
MMP-9 mRNA from detectable down to nondetectable levels;
n = 2), or a MMP-14–directed siRNA (which diminished MT1-MMP
mRNA levels to 64 F 2% of control siRNA-transfected cells; n = 2,
P < 0.05) did not significantly affect basal cell invasion or the
inhibitory action of THC on cell invasion (Fig. 5C).
THC inhibits MMP-2 expression and invasion in cultured
glioma cells via ceramide and p8. We next asked how THC
signals for inhibiting MMP-2 expression and glioma cell invasion.
The effect of THC on MMP-2 expression and invasion (Fig. 6A) in
U87 MG cells was prevented by ISP-1, a selective inhibitor of
ceramide synthesis de novo that blocks THC-induced ceramide
accumulation in glioma cells (10). We have previously reported that
the stress protein p8 is a ceramide effector in cannabinoid-induced

apoptosis (10). To determine the role of p8 in the action of THC,
we selectively reduced p8 expression by RNA interference. Thus,
transfection of U87 MG cells with a p8-directed siRNA (which
diminished p8 mRNA levels to 32 F 17% of control siRNAtransfected cells; n = 4, P < 0.01) abrogated the inhibitory action of
THC on MMP-2 expression and cell invasion (Fig. 6B).
The early-expression gene EGR-1 (also designated as krox-24)
up-regulates the expression of ATF-3 (30), which in turn, represses
the MMP-2 gene (31–33). As cannabinoids have been shown to
induce EGR-1 expression (34, 35), we examined the possible
involvement of the EGR-1/ATF-3 pathway in THC-mediated
MMP-2 down-regulation. However, transfection of U87 MG cells
with either an EGR-1–directed siRNA (which diminished EGR-1
mRNA levels to 44 F 12% of control siRNA-transfected cells; n = 4,
P < 0.05) or an ATF-3–directed siRNA (which diminished ATF-3

Cannabinoid Inhibition of MMP-2 Expression in Gliomas

effectors of these actions have not been fully characterized as
yet. Here, we show that cannabinoid administration selectively
down-regulates MMP-2 expression in mice bearing gliomas as well
as in two patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
Cannabinoid-induced inhibition of MMP-2 expression was also
evident in cultured glioma cells, indicating that the changes
observed in gliomas in vivo reflect—at least in part—the direct
effect of cannabinoids on tumor cells. MMP-2 expression is upregulated in almost all human cancers, including gliomas, and this
has been shown to be closely associated with negative prognosis
(19, 21, 28). Additionally, experiments in animal models of cancer—
including glioma—in which tumor cells express decreased or
increased levels of MMP-2 have provided direct evidence for a role
of MMP-2 in tumor progression (19, 21, 25, 26). Likewise, data in
the present report shows that inhibition of MMP-2 expression
mediates cannabinoid-induced inhibition of glioma cell invasion
and supports MMP-2 down-regulation as a new hallmark of
cannabinoid antitumoral activity. Nonetheless, we are aware that
the role of MMPs in tumor progression is an extremely complex
issue. Thus, accruing basic and clinical evidence supports the
assumption that MMPs and other proteases could either enhance
or suppress tumor progression depending on factors such as the
type of enzyme and tumor, and taking into consideration the
characteristics of the experimental setting (21, 36). In addition,
tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases may have a dual role in
tumor progression via their classical MMP inhibitory actions
(19, 20), and by recently discovered MMP-independent actions such
as the promotion of tumor proliferation and angiogenesis (37).
Hence, in addition to the down-regulation of MMP-2 expression,
factors such as changes in tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1
levels (17), are most likely involved in both cannabinoid-induced
inhibition of MMP-2 enzymatic activity (11) and the overall control
of tumor cell invasion by cannabinoids (present report).
It has been shown that cannabinoids modulate sphingolipidmetabolizing pathways, thereby increasing the intracellular levels
of ceramide (5, 7), a lipid second messenger that inhibits tumor
cell growth and survival in different systems (38). Specifically, the
stimulation of ceramide synthesis de novo is critically involved in
cannabinoid-induced apoptosis of glioma cells (10, 23) and
inhibition of glioma angiogenesis (13). The findings reported here

expand the role of de novo–synthesized ceramide in cannabinoid
antitumoral action and support the hypothesis that this lipid
messenger, via the stress-related protein p8, is involved in the
regulation of MMP-2 expression and tumor cell invasion. In the
context of the ‘‘sphingolipid rheostat’’ theory, the antiproliferative
sphingolipid ceramide would blunt MMP-2 expression as well as
tumor growth and invasion (present study, refs. 5, 13), whereas the
mitogenic sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate would shift the
balance towards MMP-2 up-regulation (39) and tumorigenesis (38).
The use of cannabinoids in medicine is limited by the
psychoactive effects mediated by neuronal CB1 receptors (1, 2).
Although these adverse effects are within the range of those
accepted for other medications, especially in cancer treatment,
and tend to disappear with tolerance upon continuous use, it is
obvious that cannabinoid-based therapies devoid of side effects
would be desirable (3–5). Because glioma cells express functional
CB2 receptors (7), we tested the effect of the nonpsychoactive,
CB2 receptor-selective agonist JWH-133 and found that it indeed
depresses MMP-2 expression in vivo. Likewise, the use of CB
receptor type–selective antagonists indicates that CB2 receptors
participate in THC-induced inhibition of MMP-2 expression in
glioma cells. As selective CB2 receptor activation to mice has
been shown to inhibit the growth and angiogenesis of gliomas
(11, 13, 27), skin carcinomas (8) and melanomas (15), our observations further support the possibility of finding cannabinoid-based
antitumoral strategies devoid of nondesired psychotropic side
effects.
