BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study was to catalog genomic and epigenomic abnormalities in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients and determine the correlation among clinical, genetic, and epigenetic profiles and clinical outcome. METHODS: This study retrospectively included 68 consecutive patients who underwent surgical
treatment and received standard radiotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ)-based chemotherapy. Of a total of 68
patients, 39 patients (57.4%) received interferon (IFN)-b in combination of TMZ. RESULTS: The genetic and epigenetic alterations frequently observed were EGFR amplification (51.5%), TP53 mutation (33.8%), CDKN2A loss (32.4%),
TP53 loss (16.2%), methylation of the MGMT promoter (33.8%) and IDH1 mutation (5.9%). Multivariate analysis
revealed that methylated MGMT promoter and the combination of TMZ and IFN-b were independent prognostic factors associated with survival. The median survival time (MST) of the patients who received the combination of IFN-b
and TMZ was significantly greater with 19.9 months as compared to the TMZ alone group (12.7 months). Notably, in
even patients whose tumors had unmethylated MGMT promoter, the MST prolonged to 17.2 months when receiving
TMZ with IFN-b, compared to 12.5 months in those receiving TMZ without IFN-b. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together,
addition of IFN-b for newly diagnosed primary GBM achieved a favorable outcome, particularly in patients with

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most frequent primary brain tumors in the central nervous system
in adults and is highly malignant, with a median survival time of about one year from diagnosis. This is despite aggressive
treatment, surgery, postoperative radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. An international randomized trial by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/National Cancer Institute of Canada (EORTC/NCIC) comparing radiotherapy alone and concomitant radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) clearly attested the benefits of
adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy for GBM patients.1 Since then, TMZ has been the current first-line chemotherapeutic
agent for GBM.
A subanalysis in this trial showed the effectiveness of epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation with longer survival in patients with primary GBM; it also suggested the benefits of combining chemotherapy using
TMZ with radiotherapy.2

Furthermore, there have been recent attempts to
comprehensively profile GBM genes by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and other groups.3,4 Some
genetic aberrations in GBM, such as TP53 mutation or
deletion, NF1 deletion or mutation, and ERBB2 mutation, have been found to be more common than previously reported. In addition, novel molecular markers,
such as frequent mutations of the IDH1 and IDH2 genes
in secondary GBM have been discovered.5-7 These findings on mutations, genomic and epigenomic aberrations,
and transcriptomal features in GBM might aid in understanding the classification of GBM and its further potential clinical implications.
However, the TCGA project included GBM
patients who received surgical treatment, and detailed information on adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was not provided. Therefore, the close relationship between the gene
profile provided by TCGA and chemotherapy regimens
remains unknown.3
In this current study, we aimed to determine the correlation between clinical, genetic, and epigenetic profiles,
and clinical outcome in newly diagnosed GBM patients
who received TMZ-based chemotherapy. Interestingly,
we found a significant beneficial outcome in patients
receiving TMZ in addition to IFN-b. Moreover, our
study discovered that GBM patients with the ummethylated
O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase
(MGMT) promoter, in particular, showed benefits from
IFN-b.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient population
We retrospectively reviewed 68 consecutive patients with
newly diagnosed primary GBM who underwent surgical
treatment at several academic tertiary-care neurosurgical
institutions: Nagoya University Hospital, Hamamatsu
University Hospital, Oita University Hospital, and Shizuoka Cancer Center from May 2006 through June 2010
after TMZ was approved as the treatment agent for malignant gliomas by the National Ministry of Health and
Welfare of Japan. The diagnosis of GBM was established
by histological confirmation according to the WHO
guidelines8,9 independently by at least two expert neuropathologists. The clinical, operative, and hospital course
records were reviewed. Information collected from clinical
notes included patient demographics, pre- and postoperative neuroimaging, and adjuvant therapy. Preoperative
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status

1722

(ECOG PS) scores were assigned by the clinician at the
time of evaluation and were available in the chart for
review for all patients. The study was approved by the
institutional review board at each participating hospital
and complied with all provisions of the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Treatment
Radiotherapy

After undergoing surgery, the patients received focal
external-beam radiotherapy by conventional radiation
planning to approximately 60 Gray (Gy) (5% total
dose), with daily concurrent TMZ at 75 mg/m2 throughout the course of radiotherapy.
Chemotherapy

All patients received the standard Stupp regimen.1
In the absence of grade 3 or 4 hematological excessive toxicity, TMZ administration was continued until clinical or
radiological evidence of disease progression was observed.
Of these 68 patients, 39 patients (57.4%) received adjuvant IFN-b treatment (Table 1). Patients in Nagoya University and Oita University received chemotherapy
consisting of IFN-b. There were no significant differences
in any of the clinical parameters and genetic, epigenetic
parameters (i.e., age, sex, preoperative PS, tumor location,
extent of resection, genetic and epigenetic alterations
between the institutions using regimen with and without
IFN-b. The IFN-b chemotherapy regimen comprised 3
million international units (MIU)/body administered
intravenously on alternate days during radiotherapy and
TMZ-induction chemotherapy.10,11 At the end of the
induction period, after a 4-week interval, the patients
were administered 3 MIU/body of IFN-b on the first
morning every 4 weeks during TMZ maintenance chemotherapy. In the case of tumor progression, salvage or second-line therapy was administered at the investigators’
discretion;
most
patients
received
additional
chemotherapy.
Response Evaluation During Treatment
Both radiological and clinical findings were used to evaluate the response. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) was performed for alternate cycles. If the MRI
showed continued increase in enhancement, the case was
considered as tumor progression. If re-resection was performed for a recurrent mass lesion, histological interpretation formed the basis for definitive diagnosis (treatmentrelated necrosis vs recurrent tumor).

Tumor Samples and DNA Extraction
All patients provided their written informed consent for
molecular studies of their tumor, and the protocol was
approved by the ethics committee at each center. Sixtyeight brain tumor specimens were obtained at the time of
first surgical resection.
Tumor tissue samples were immediately frozen and
stored at 80 C until the extraction of genomic DNA.
DNA was prepared using the QIAmp DNA Mini kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Placental DNA was used as the normal control. The amount of DNA obtained from the
tumor was sufficient for the subsequent genomic and epigenomic analyses.
Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe
Amplification
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)
was used for the determination of allelic losses and gains of
the gene in the tumor samples. The analysis was performed

Cancer

April 15, 2011

using the SALSA MLPA KIT P088-B1 and P105-C1 in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, Netherland).12-15 Information regarding
the probe sequences and ligation sites can be found at
www.mlpa.com. Amplification products were separated on
an ABIV 3130  I Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) and quantified with Genemapper 4.0
software (Applied Biosystems). Duplicate experiments
were performed to obtain accurate MLPA values. Data
analysis was performed with an original Excel-based program based on MRC-Holland’s procedures. Normalization
for sample data was first performed on control probes, and
each tumor sample was then normalized using the data on
2 control samples, using peripheral blood DNA. Single
regression for control and tumor data slope correction was
performed. Abnormal/normal ratio limits were set at 0.65
and 1.3. Statistical analysis was performed using the same
Coffalyser software.
Pyrosequencing
Tumor DNA was modified with bisulfate using the EpiTect
bisulfite kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf Cedex, France). Pyrosequencing technology was used to determine the methylation
status of the CpG island region of MGMT as described
previously.16,17 We used the touchdown PCR method.
The primer sequences used were the MGMT forward
primer, 50 -TTGGTAAATTAAGGTATAGAGTTTT-30 ,
and the MGMT biotinylated reverse primer, 50 -AAA
CAATCTACGCATCCT-30 . PCR included a denaturation
step at 95 C for 30 s, followed by annealing at various temperatures for 45 s, and extension at 72 C for 45 s. After
PCR, the biotinylated PCR product was purified as recommended by the manufacturer. In brief, the PCR product was
bound to Streptavidin Sepharose HP (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), and the Sepharose beads containing
the immobilized PCR product were purified, washed, and
denatured using 0.2 N NaOH solution and washed again.
Next, 0.3 mM pyrosequencing primer was annealed to the
purified single-stranded PCR product, and pyrosequencing
was performed using the PSQ HS 96 Pyrosequencing System (Pyrosequencing, Westborough, MA). The pyrosequencing primer was 50 -GGAAGTTGGGAAGG-30 .
Methylation quantification was performed using the provided software.
TP53 and IDH1/IDH2 Sequencing
Direct sequencing of the TP53 exons 5 to 8 and IDH1/
IDH2 was performed as previously described.7,18,19 The
primer sequences are listed in Table 2.

For IDH sequencing, a fragment 129 bp in length,
spanning the sequence encoding the catalytic domain of
IDH1, including codon 132, and a fragment 150 bp in
length spanning the sequence encoding the catalytic domain of IDH2, including codon 172, were amplified. We
applied touchdown PCR, using the standard buffer conditions: it comprised 5 ng of DNA and AmpliTaq Gold
DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems) run for 16 cycles
with denaturation at 95 C for 30 s, annealing at 65 to
57 C (decreasing by 0.5 C per cycle) for 30 s, and extension at 72 C for 60 s in a total volume of 12.5 ll and add
30 cycles with denaturation at 95 C for 30 s, annealing at
55 C for 30 s, and extension at 72 C for 60 s, ending
with at 72 C for 7 min to complete extension.
Direct sequencing was performed using BigDye
Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The reactions were carried out using an ABI 3100
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS for Windows, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). The Mann-Whitney U test, v2 test, and Fisher
exact test were used to test for association of clinical variables and molecular markers. Survival was estimated by
using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were
compared by using the log-rank test. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the day of first surgery
until tumor progression, death, or end of follow up. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the day of first surgery until death or the end of follow up. Univariate and
multivariate analyses were performed to test the potential
influence of baseline characteristics on survival. The effect

1724

of each single molecular marker on PFS and OS was investigated using the Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for the major clinical prognostic factors, including age
at diagnosis (<40 vs 40, <60 vs 60 years), ECOG
performance status score (ECOG PS; 1 vs >1), extent
of resection (macroscopic [gross] total resection [GTR] vs
non-GTR), tumor location (superficial vs deep), MGMT
promoter methylation status, chromosome 1p loss of heterozygosity (LOH), 19qLOH, PTEN loss, CDKN2A loss,
TP53 loss and mutation, ERBB2 amplification, EGFR
amplification, IDH1 and IDH2 mutation, and adjuvant
therapy (with IFN-b vs without IFN-b). Factors with no
significant association with survival, at a level of more
than 0.05 in the multivariate analysis, were eliminated.
The remaining factors in the multivariate proportional
hazard model (P <.05) were considered to be independent predictors of survival.
To assess for the treatment effects of TMZ with
IFN-b versus TMZ without IFN-b for overall survival
(OS), the hazard ratio was computed using a proportional
hazard model by baseline characteristics in stratified
analysis.

RESULTS
Clinical Parameters
Between May 2006 and June 2010, 68 consecutive
patients newly diagnosed with primary GBM were registered in this study. Their clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. This study group comprised 41 men
and 27 women aged 12-84 years (median, 55). The median preoperative ECOG PS score at diagnosis was 1
(range, 0-3); the preoperative ECOG PS score was <1 in
45 patients (66.2%). All tumors were located in the supratentorial region: 50 tumors were located in the superficial
area (cortical or subcortical area), and 18 were located in
deep anatomical structures such as the basal ganglia and
corpus callosum. No tumor was noted in the optic nerve,
olfactory nerve, and pituitary gland on pretreatment
MRI. No tumor dissemination was detected by MRI. Surgical GTR was achieved in 24 patients (35.3%), and 44
patients underwent non-GTR (64.7%). None of the
patients had concurrent active malignancy, and the baseline organ function before chemotherapy was as follows:
absolute WBC 3000/mm3 or neutrophil count

arrhythmia and no serious ischemic heart disease. All
patients received the standard Stupp regimen,1 and
among these, 39 patients were received combination treatment with IFN-b, as described in the method section.
Frequency of Genetic and Epigenetic
Alterations
Of 68 cases, we could obtain sufficient genetic and epigenetic information in all cases. We used direct sequencing
for TP53 and IDH1/2. We employed MLPA for the analysis of 1p/19q LOH, loss of TP53, PTEN and CDKN2A,
and amplification of ERBB2 and EGFR. MLPA is a multiplex PCR method that detects abnormal copy numbers of
up to 50 different genomic DNA sequences simultaneously. When comparing MLPA to FISH, MLPA not only
has the advantage of being a multiplex technique but also
one in which very small (50-70 nt) sequences are targeted,
enabling MLPA to identify the frequent, single gene aberrations that are very small to be detected by FISH. Furthermore, for the detection of EGFR amplification,
MLPA can examine exons 1-8, 13, 16, and 22, while pre-

Cancer

viously reported real-time PCR covers only exons 2, 17,
and 25. In our preliminary experiments, MLPA was
found to be approximately 80% consistent with the realtime PCR method (data not shown). Notably, the methylation status of the MGMT promoter was analyzed by
quantitative pyrosequencing technology. Although methylation-specific PCR analysis of MGMT promoter methylation is a widely applicable biomarker for the clinical
setting, it is non quantitative and bears a risk of false-positive or false-negative results, especially when the DNA
quality and/or quantity is low. Recent attempts to remedy
some of these deficiencies have led to the development of
an alternative sequence-based approach for methylation
analysis, known as pyrosequencing. Pyrosequencing yields
continuous methylation values ranging from 0-100%.
Based on our comparisons with standard methylationspecific PCR and immunohistochemical study using the
anti-MGMT antibody, we determined 14% as the threshold distinguishing unmethylation and methylation of the
MGMT promoter in a given tumor.
As indicated in Figure 1 and Table 3, the alterations
frequently observed were EGFR amplification (51.5%),
TP53 mutation (33.8%), CDKN2A loss (32.4%), TP53
loss (16.2%), methylation of the MGMT promoter
(33.8%), and IDH1 mutation (5.9%). These findings
were consistent with those in previous reports.3,9,20,21
Clinical, Genetic, and Epigenetic Parameters
Associated With Survival in GBM Patients
The median follow-up time was 16.7 months (range, 3.446.7 months). The median PFS for all patients was 9.2
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.7-12.7). The
median OS of all patients was 17.1 months (95% CI,
15.5-18.7) (Figure 2A). The log-rank tests demonstrated
that tumor localization (P ¼ .032), the MGMT methylation status (P ¼ .029), and TP53 mutation or loss (P ¼
.035) were associated with the OS of patients with GBM
(Figure 2B-D). These findings were similar to univariate
analysis, where deep location (P ¼ .035), unmethylated
MGMT promoter (P ¼ .033) and TP53 mutation or loss
(P ¼ .038) were identified as candidate variables for
poorer OS (Figure 2). In contrast, well-established prognostic factors such as age, ECOG PS, and the extent of tumor resection did not influence the outcome in this
clinical setting. Next, we established multivariate survival
models for OS. The model was designed to consider each
of these factors without considering the interaction terms.
The independent prognostic factors for OS were methylated MGMT promoter (P ¼ .016).

compared to the TMZ alone group, which was 12.7

Benefits of IFN-b for GBM Patients With the
Unmethylated MGMT Promoter
Next, we sought to determine the subpopulation that had
benefited from the use of the IFN-b combination treatment. It is well known that patients with GBM containing
the methylated MGMT promoter benefit from TMZ,
but those with the unmethylated MGMT promoter show
no such benefits.1,2 Consistently, the median OS of 45
patients with the unmethylated MGMT status was significantly lesser than that of the patients with the methylated
promoter (median OS ¼ 15.1 months; 95% CI, 11.318.9). Notably, even in patients whose tumors had the
unmethylated MGMT promoter, the median OS was
prolonged to 17.2 months (95% CI, 13.9-20.6) when
receiving TMZ with IFN-b as compared to the 12.5
months (95% CI, 11.3-13.7) in those receiving TMZ
without IFN-b (P ¼ .017) (Figure 3B).
Various associations of these clinical and molecular
parameters were evaluated. A complete overview of the
pairwise associations between these parameters and chemotherapy with or without IFN-b is provided in Figure 4.
The relative hazards of OS between TMZ with or without
IFN-b groups according to 6 baseline covariates, calculated by means of multivariate analysis, are shown. There
were significant associations among patients under 40
years of age (P ¼ .025), with ECOG PS 1 (P ¼ .004),
deep tumor location (P ¼ .028), non-GTR (P ¼ .048),
and ummethylated MGMT status (P ¼ .02) (Figure 4).

and methylation of the MGMT promoter (33.8%).
Recent large-scale efforts to characterize the GBM genome have identified additional alterations in genes not
previously implicated in glioma, such as ERBB2 and
IDH1/IDH2 mutation in primary and secondary GBM,
respectively, and a significant incidence of mutation and
genomic loss of NF1.3,4,6 The TCGA study also noted
TP53 mutations and losses in 35% of the cases, which is a
surprisingly higher frequency than that reported previously.3,20,21 Furthermore, this study also revealed EGFR
amplification (45%), CDKN2A loss (52.0%), and methylation of the MGMT promoter (20.9%). These results
were consistent with our data. IDH1 mutations have
recently been identified in gliomas, which are a strong
predictor of a more favorable prognosis.6 Our study supported the finding that within the group of primary

Cancer

GBM, IDH1 mutations are rare and tend to define a
prognostically favorable outcome.
Factors for Prognosis and Prediction of
Response to Therapy
The current study demonstrated that the methylated
MGMT promoter and the combination of IFN-b and
TMZ were independent prognostic indicators of GBM
patients on multivariate analysis. Epigenetic silencing by
the MGMT promoter methylation correlates with
improved survival in glioma patients treated with
TMZ.2,22-25 The prognostic significance of MGMT promoter methylation has been shown in several clinical trials. In these studies, MGMT promoter methylation was
an independent favorable prognostic factor and patients
whose tumor contained a methylated MGMT promoter

unmethylated MGMT promoter (U-MGMT) (B) (P ¼ .017). The
hazards ratio (HR) was adjusted for the factors; age, Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS),
the extent of tumor resection, MGMT promoter methylation
status, TP53 mutation or loss, and TMZ with or without IFN-b
in the multivariate analysis.

showed overall prolonged survival when treated with
TMZ and radiotherapy. Our results demonstrated
similarly that MGMT promoter hypermethylation determined by a novel pyrosequencing technology was significantly associated with better OS.
There are several contradicting reports on survival
related to the prognostic value of TP53 mutations in
GBM, showing either no association or that the presence
of TP53 mutations was a favorable or an unfavorable
prognostic factor.9,20,21,26 On the other hand, our results

demonstrated that TP53 mutation or loss was significantly associated with poor OS only in univariate analysis,
but not in multivariate analysis. These findings were not
in conflict with recent evidence, which shows that TP53
mutations not only disrupt its function but also possess
gain-of-function and dominant-negative effects on the
wild-type p53 protein, thus making the mutated TP53
gene an oncogene.27
Benefits of IFN-b and TMZ combination
treatment for GBM
The current study demonstrated that newly diagnosed
primary GBM patients were associated with a favorable
outcome on IFN-b and TMZ combination chemotherapy. The IFN-b and TMZ combination group achieved a
median OS of 19.9 months (Figure 3A). This excellent
result was almost equal to the median OS of only patients
with the methylated MGMT promoter in the EORTC/
NCIC trial.
IFN-b elicits pleiotropic biological effects such as
antiproliferation, immunomodulation, and cell differentiation.28 Furthermore, it has been widely used either alone or
in combination with other antitumor agents in the treatment of malignant brain tumors and melanomas. In our
previous studies, we showed that combination therapy with

IFN-b and TMZ Combination Therapy for GBM/Motomura et al

IFN-b and nitrosourea has been particularly useful in the
treatment of malignant gliomas in Japan.10 IFN-b has multifaceted functions related to antitumor activity, such as
cytostatic effects, participating in the differentiation of
CTLs and potentiation of their antitumor immunological
responses, and behavior as a drug sensitizer to enhance toxicity against various malignant neoplasms when administered in combination with nitrosourea.10 Previously, in an
in vitro study, we corroborated that IFN-b markedly
enhanced chemosensitivity to TMZ29; this manifestation
revealed that one of the major mechanisms by which IFNb enhances chemosensitivity is the down-regulation of
MGMT transcription. This effect was also confirmed in an
experimental animal model.30 A subanalysis in this study
showed that patients whose tumor had an unmethylated
promoter benefited from the addition of IFN-b, suggesting
that the combination of IFN-b and TMZ might provide
better clinical outcomes in patients with the unmethylated
MGMT promoter (Figures 3B, 4). Although we discovered
that the patients under 40 years of age at diagnosis and
those who had an initial ECOG PS 1 seemed to receive
the benefit from IFN-b and TMZ combination therapy,
our phase I study revealed that the combination regimen of
IFN-b and TMZ was safe and well tolerated even in
patients with older age and worse PS (Figure 4; manuscript
in submission). In addition, the benefit associated with
IFN-b was shown in patients whose tumors were deep,
who had undergone non-GTR (Figure 4). This finding
suggests that IFN-b might be better for use in cases of complicated tumor removal, i.e., when the tumors were deep,
all the tumors could not be removed because they were, for
example, located in an eloquent area or around essential
structures.
In summary, this study supported the hypothesis
that in cases of newly diagnosed primary GBM, IFN-b
and TMZ combination therapy was significantly associated with a favorable outcome. To our knowledge, this is
the first study to associate the survival benefits derived
from IFN-b and TMZ combination. These benefits were,
in particular, well correlated in patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter.
Our results are limited as opposed to a prospective
clinical trial as retrospective studies might have been influenced by unrecognized biases. However, the subject group
we used was a consecutive series of patients, and this study
provides novel information on the treatment for GBM.
Thus, accumulation of evidence for this treatment will
help further improvement of this disease and hopefully
become a novel therapy. We are planning a prospective

randomized control trial to compare the clinical outcomes
between TMZ alone and a combination of TMZ and
IFN-b in newly diagnosed GBM patients.
