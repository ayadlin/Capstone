BACKGROUND: Preclinical and clinical studies suggest mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors may have metabolic and
antiangiogenic effects, and synergize with epidermal growth factor pathway inhibitors. Therefore, a phase 1/pharmacodynamic trial of
everolimus with cetuximab was performed. METHODS: A total of 29 patients were randomized to a run-in of oral everolimus (30, 50,
or 70 mg) or cetuximab (400 mg/m2 loading, 250 mg/m2 maintenance) weekly, followed by the combination in this dose-escalation
study. Primary endpoints were phase 2 dose and toxicity characterization. [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
(FDG-PET) was performed as a pharmacodynamic marker of mTOR inhibition, and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (DCE-MRI) was performed as an indicator of tumor perfusion changes, at 3 time points. RESULTS: Everolimus and cetuximab
were tolerable at full doses, with an expected toxicity profile. Dose-limiting toxicities in the everolimus 70 mg group included grade 3
skin toxicity in 2 patients, and mucositis in 1 patient. Of 16 patients evaluable for response, 5 had stable disease lasting 4 to 19
months. Mean change in maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for those treated initially with everolimus was 224% (2% to
254%), and with cetuximab was 25% (223 to 36%). The Ktrans measured by DCE-MRI did not decrease, regardless of run-in drug.
CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus and cetuximab can be safely administered at standard doses, and are associated with prolonged disease
control. The recommended phase 2 dose of oral weekly everolimus is 70 mg in combination with standard cetuximab. Imaging studies
reveal that metabolic inhibition by everolimus alone and in combination with cetuximab predominates over changes in tumor perfuC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Abnormalities in epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway signaling underlie the growth of many epithelial cancers. Cetuximab competitively inhibits EGF from binding to its receptor, blocking activation of multiple proliferation
pathways including the PI3K/PTEN/Akt and Ras/Ref/MEK/ERK pathways.1,2 However, cancer cells exposed to this
drug can upregulate these and other pathways in order to evade its effects.3 Everolimus binds to FK-506 binding protein
12 to inhibit mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) activation, and so inhibits the PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathway. Inhibition of this pathway has led to disruption of tumor growth and angiogenesis in animal models.4 These compounds, and
indeed their classes, are active in different tumor types, suggesting that their actions in controlling cancer cells are nonredundant. We therefore sought to explore inhibition of EGFR signaling at 2 levels: at the receptor, and more distally
along the PI3K/PTEN/Akt survival pathway through the combined use of cetuximab with everolimus.
Both everolimus and temsirolimus are approved for the treatment of renal cell cancer, a tumor that responds to
antiangiogenic drugs as a class. In addition to their role in inhibition of tumor proliferation pathways, mTOR inhibitors are thought to exert some of their effects through antiangiogenesis. This notion stems from the potential role of

the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in tumor
angiogenesis.4,5 An in vivo study by Lane et al5 showed
that everolimus specifically inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced new vessel formation, reduced the total number of vessels, and decreased
the number of mature vessels. A number of other studies have elucidated possible involved mechanisms. In a
model of Akt activation,6 mTOR inhibition led to
inactivation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, a key
growth factor driving renal cancer proliferation.7 Mabuchi et al8 showed that treatment of hypoxic human
ovarian cancer cell lines with everolimus in vitro led to
a decrease in VEGF expression. Furthermore, CD31immunopositive vessels in peritoneal tumors from mice
treated with everolimus were smaller and fewer than
vessels in placebo-treated mice, supporting the antiangiogenic properties of everolimus.8 Tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) has been implicated as a facilitator of
tumor angiogenesis through dysregulated mTOR signaling.9 Inhibition of the tuberous sclerosis 1 tumor suppressor (TSC1) by IKKb, a downstream kinase in the
TNFa pathway, leads to activation of the mTOR pathway, and ultimately to inflammation-mediated tumor
angiogenesis.9 In vivo studies have also discovered that
PI3K/Akt and mTOR/p70S6K signaling is vital to
ErbB2-mediated increases in VEGF and angiogenesis in
mouse mammary fat pad tumor xenografts.10 Taken together, these studies point to a possible antiangiogenic
role for mTOR inhibitors, in addition to the antiproliferative role discussed above.
Therefore, in designing a study to investigate a combination of cetuximab with everolimus, we sought also to
understand the pharmacodynamic effects of each in the
treated tumors. We studied each patient with a run-in of
one drug first, followed by the combination. At each level,
patients were randomly allocated to receive either cetuximab or everolimus as a single agent. We performed both
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
(FDG-PET) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) as markers of metabolic
inhibition and of antiangiogenic effects, respectively,
before treatment, after one drug, and finally after the
combination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

phase 2 dose and toxicity profile for the drug combination. The secondary goal was to evaluate the impact of the
drug combination on treatment of advanced cancers, and
to assess and compare results of computed tomography
(CT), FDG-PET, and DCE-MRI.
Study Population

Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, had a histologic
or cytologic diagnosis of a malignant solid tumor for
which no available therapies with greater clinical benefit
were available, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0 to 2, and had adequate
bone marrow, liver, and renal function.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of Pennsylvania, and all patients
provided written informed consent in accordance with
federal, state, and institutional guidelines.
Treatment Plan

A total of 29 patients were entered onto 1 of 2 arms;
patients were assigned using a blocked randomization
scheme. Patients in Arm A received everolimus weekly for
3 weeks, whereas patients in Arm B received cetuximab on
the same schedule. After 21 days, patients received both
everolimus and cetuximab weekly (Fig. 1).
Everolimus was administered in weekly doses of 30,
50, and 70 mg orally via a modified 3 1 3 dose-escalation
design, in which the order of drug addition was varied to
better understand the pharmacodynamic endpoints. Termination of dose escalation was intended if dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in one-third or more of patients at a
given dose level, and it was planned to expand accrual at the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Cetuximab was dosed at
400 mg/m2 intravenously initially, then 250 mg/m2 weekly.
One cycle was defined as a 4-week treatment period starting
with the first day of combination therapy. Treatment with
both agents continued until disease progression.
Toxicity was graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 3.0. DLTs were
defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/mm3
for > 7 days, ANC < 1000/mm3 with fever > 101 F, platelet count < 25,000/mm3,  grade 3 skin toxicity requiring dose reduction of cetuximab, and  grade 3 laboratory
or other nonhematologic values. The phase 2 dose was
defined as the highest dose of the combination that gave
rise to DLTs in less than one-third of patients treated.

Study Design

The study was a dose-escalating phase 1 trial of the combination of everolimus and cetuximab in patients with
advanced cancers. The primary goal was to establish a

Figure 1. Schema for drug schedule.

Laboratory evaluation was repeated weekly. CT with tumor measurements was performed at baseline and after
every 8 weeks of the combination drug therapy. Response
rates were determined using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines.
FDG-PET and DCE-MRI were performed at baseline, after 3 weeks of single-agent therapy, and after 3
weeks of combination therapy. PET and PET/CT were
acquired with Philips Allegro and Philips Gemini TF
machines, respectively. All systems were calibrated to
manufacturerâ€™s recommendations and within the allowable variation, according to the American College of Radiology Imaging Network, when using a uniform cylinder.
Images were obtained 60 minutes after administration of
15 mCi (610%) of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose. In evaluating FDG-PET, up to 5 lesions were identified and average
changes in SUVmax (maximum standardized uptake
value) were analyzed. Response rates were determined
using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria.11
DCE-MRI was performed on a 1.5 T magnet (Symphony; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). Axial T1 and T2
weighted images were obtained for tumor localization.
T1-mapping was performed with a variable flip angle
approach prior to enhanced imaging with 0.1 mmol/kg
gadodiamide (Omniscan; GE Healthcare). For the initial
19 patients, thin-slab (8 slices) coronal DCE-MRI was
performed through a tumor preselected from the localizing images. For the final 10 patients, a novel hybrid radial
3-dimensional imaging series12 with retrospective KWIC
Cancer

processing13 was performed for increased volume
coverage.
A single radiologist with 11 years experience in body
MRI reviewed all DCE-MRI images, blinded to study arm
and time-point relative to treatment. All visible tumor areas
were outlined manually, as was the central aorta. DCE-MRI
tumor metrics (Ktrans, Ve, kep), were computed by leastsquares fitting using the 2-compartment tumor model14
with patient-derived arterial input functions, using in-house
software (IDL; Research Services, Inc., Boulder, Colo).
Statistical Methods

Changes in SUVmax were compared across groups using
nonparametric Wilcoxon or Kruskal-Wallis tests. Changes
during the run-in period were compared by initial drug; in
the group receiving everolimus first, changes were compared
across dose groups. Among subjects who did not progress,
changes between baseline and follow-up were compared by
response status and drug order. Correlation coefficients for
continuous variables were calculated. All significance tests
were 2-sided and conducted at the P 5 .05 level.
Progression-free survival from day 1 of the combination
treatment was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Stata version 12.0 software was used for analysis.

Dose-Limiting Toxicity

Our primary objective was to determine the phase 2 doses
of everolimus and cetuximab in combination and describe
the toxicity of such treatment at various dose levels. A full
description of the incidence and severity of DLTs is
shown (Table 2). DLTs in the everolimus 70 mg dose
group included grade 3 skin toxicity in 2 patients and grade
3 mucositis in 1 patient. The first 6 patients in the 70 mg
group did not experienced any DLTs, and therefore, expansion at this MTD was implemented. One patient in the 50
mg dose group developed grade 3 hypokalemia. We also
noted grade 3 elevations in aspartate aminotransferase and

context of progression in hepatic metastases and thought
unrelated to treatment. The results suggest that the appropriate dose of everolimus for a phase 2 study when combined with cetuximab at standard dosing is 70 mg weekly.
The full profile of toxic events is summarized in
Table 3. The most common grade 2 and worse toxicities
experienced were rash (10 patients, 34% of total patients,
31% of the 70 mg group), fatigue (7 patients, 24% of total
patients, 6% of the 70 mg group), elevated alkaline phosphatase (6 patients, 21% of total patients, 31% of the 70
mg group), and hypoalbuminemia (6 patients, 21% of
total patients, 25% of the 70 mg group). Anemia, vomiting, hypomagnesemia, and hypersensitivity were experienced by 5 patients each. The toxicities experienced were
consistent with previous data from trials evaluating cetuximab15,16 or everolimus.17,18
Efficacy

The best response for each patient was evaluated using the
RECIST guidelines. Early progression in approximately
half of the patients led to just 16 of the 29 patients being
evaluated for response. The best response by RECIST was
stable disease. Five patients had stable disease for 4
months or longer (Fig. 2). Two patients with ovarian cancer in the 50 mg everolimus group had stable disease for 5
and 19 months. The former patient was treated with 7 systemic treatments previously, and the latter was treated
with 4. One patient with colon cancer and one patient
with anal cancer, both in the 70 mg everolimus group,
had stable disease for 5 and 17 months, respectively. The
patient with colon cancer was treated with 5 systemic
treatments previously, and the patient with anal cancer
was treated with 1. One patient with head and neck cancer
in the 30 mg everolimus group had stable disease for 4
months, and had no prior systemic treatments.

patients had both imaging tests done at baseline, and 27
had scans after the run-in. Two patients did not have the
imaging because they withdrew after hypersensitivity reactions to cetuximab. Sixteen and 17 patients received the

A secondary objective of the trial was to determine the
impact of adding a second agent on the biological
responses to the first agent in the EGFR pathway. The
mean change in SUVmax from baseline for those treated
with everolimus at all dose levels during run-in (n 5 14)
was 224% (range, 2% to 254%) (Fig. 3). The mean
SUVmax change in patients treated first with cetuximab
(n 5 13) was 25% (223 to 36%) (P 5 .013). The
changes in SUVmax during the run-in period were more
pronounced in patients receiving 50 to 70 mg, when compared with 30 mg of everolimus (P 5 .052). The mean
change in SUVmax from baseline to after combination for
all patients was 216%.
FDG-PET changes were also reflected in clinical
response (Fig. 4). Metabolic responders by EORTC criteria (n 5 7) had a mean progression-free survival (PFS) of
31 weeks, whereas nonmetabolic responders (n 5 9) had a
mean PFS of 11 weeks, (P 5 .13). Seven of 16 patients
who had all three FDG-PET scans had a metabolic

response after the combination. These values might be
interpreted as showing that pathway inhibition to a meaningful level was achieved in approximately half of the
patients, but this pharmacodynamic action did not always
translate into therapeutic benefit.
DCE-MRI

Ktrans did not decrease (net change of 22.6%, n 5 19,
P 5 nonsignificant), after the initial run-in. Analysis of
DCE-MRI results for everolimus and cetuximab separately demonstrated little net effect of either drug on
Ktrans. There were also no significant delayed effects on
Ktrans after 1 cycle of combined therapy. Although this
analysis presupposes that vascular effects, if any, would be
apparent after the initial dose, this assumption seems justified by consideration of the rapid Ktrans effects of
VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and other antiangiogenic agents, which often manifest early after the initiation of therapy.19-23

DISCUSSION
We conducted a dose-escalation phase 1 trial to find the
appropriate dose of everolimus, an oral inhibitor of
mTOR that results in antiproliferative properties, when
given in combination with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits EGFR activity with similar effects, to
an unselected population of patients with advanced cancer. Treatment with the combination therapy was generally well tolerated in a population of patients with
excellent performance status. The toxicities were consistent with adverse effects observed in previous trials evaluating cetuximab at standard dosing and oral everolimus at
10 mg daily and 70 mg weekly.15-18 DLTs occurred in
less than one-third of the patients in any dose category.
Thus, the MTD of everolimus when given in conjunction
with cetuximab was deemed to be 70 mg weekly. This
dosing was also well tolerated over a prolonged treatment
schedule; 5 of 16 patients had prolonged stable disease
with especially remarkable responses in one patient each
with ovarian and anal cancers. Phase 2 trials to identify
susceptible subpopulations should be considered in these
diseases.
Preclinical data supports the hypothesis that resistance mechanisms to drugs such as cetuximab may be
reversed by using a combination of drugs that target proliferation pathways downstream. Wang et al24 have concluded that the combination of an mTOR inhibitor with
Cancer

the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib synergistically repressed the
growth of both human cancer cells in cell cultures and
xenografts in nude mice. Furthermore, erlotinib can suppress mTOR inhibition-induced feedback activation of
several survival signaling pathways including Akt, ERK,
and eIF4E.24 Shao et al25 have shown that when PI3K/
mTOR activity is inhibited, intestinal epithelial cells
become arrested in G1. However, Ras-mediated transformation of the cells to a more invasive phenotype is
enhanced and associated with an increase in MEK activity.
The addition of a MEK inhibitor, PD-98059, in this situation acts to negate this effect.25 These data suggest that
interactions between mTOR and the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathways exist, and if one pathway is blocked, the other
may be upregulated. Thus, there may be therapeutic value
to blocking both pathways simultaneously.
This trial provided the opportunity to investigate
the pharmacodynamic basis of the action of these drugs,
singly and together. As noted above, both cetuximab and
everolimus are recognized to inhibit survival signaling in
the EGFR/Akt/mTOR pathway, and the activity of
mTOR inhibitors in renal cell26,27 and hepatocellular
cancers28,29 has raised the possibility that inhibition of
this pathway, possibly in endothelial cells, may reflect an
antiangiogenic effect of mTOR inhibition. More widely
recognized is the role of mTOR in metabolic regulation,
and any additional contribution of cetuximab to this
effect would be of mechanistic and therapeutic interest.
Therefore, we evaluated 2 pharmacodynamic imaging
biomarkers: FDG-PET for metabolism and DCE-MRI
for tumor perfusion as a marker of angiogenesis. The
results were somewhat surprising, because there was no
evidence of an antiangiogenic effect in these tumors,
although there was a profound inhibition of FDG uptake
suggestive of a brisk response on the target in tumor cells.
This finding might be viewed as a confirmation of a preclinical finding of Lane et al5 in whose studies, using
DCE-MRI scans in mice, everolimus did not lead to
changes in tumor blood vessel permeability. It has also
been suggested that tumor endothelial cells might express
EGFR30,31 but cetuximab alone had no effect on Ktrans in
the tumors either. Elevated baseline Ktrans has been shown
to be a marker of increased benefit of treatment with an
angiogenesis inhibitor.32 Lower baseline Ktrans values on
the other hand may predict treatment failure with antiangiogenic agents.33 The patients on our study all had a
baseline Ktrans < 0.3 minute21. A limitation of these
results may be that we did not have renal or hepatoma
patients to study in this trial, and the antiangiogenic
response might be more evident in these tumors. A second
Cancer

January 1, 2014

limitation is that we do not know the Kras status of all
patients on the trial, because the trial began prior to when
Kras testing became the standard-of-care for certain tumor types.
Although an antiangiogenic effect was not identified
in our trial, everolimus was found to have significant effects
on metabolism, in excess of those of cetuximab, as revealed
by the results of FDG-PET examination (Fig. 3). Our analysis is consistent with preclinical and clinical trials that
show a reduction in standardized uptake value (SUV) after
administration of everolimus. In a xenograft model of gastrointestinal stromal tumor, everolimus strongly reduced
FDG uptake alone and in combination with imatinib.34 In
a mouse ovarian xenograft, SUVmean decreased by 33% at
day 2 and by 66% at day 7 of everolimus; this reduction
correlated with the level of mTOR inhibition based on ex
vivo immunohistochemistry studies.35 FDG-PET data
from 8 patients with non-small cell lung cancer showed
that 5 patients had a reduction in FDG uptake at day 8 of
everolimus monotherapy.36 Everolimus was associated
with a median change in SUVmax of 221.2% in a population of 46 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.37
As a pharmacodynamic marker, these findings suggest that
FDG-PET will be of value; however, preclinical and clinical studies by Ma et al found that changes in FDG-PET
were not predictive of response to an mTOR inhibitor.38
The current value of FDG-PET is likely to be in reflecting
the degree of mTOR inhibition, although that too will
require validation. Larger trials will be required to identify
a predictive role for FDG-PET in specific tumor types.
Hence, identification of susceptible tumors is a high
priority, as is an understanding of the basis of pharmacodynamic resistance in those who had no metabolic change
in tumor. Notably, significant metabolic effects were seen
in patients who received the 50 and 70 mg dose of everolimus during the run-in period when compared to patients
who received the 30 mg dose (P5.052), suggesting a relationship between dose and change in SUVmax.
The outcome data showing a possible PFS increment (P 5 .13) in SUV responders supports further investigation of PET imaging for prediction of therapeutic
benefit. As noted by Markman et al,39 and in this trial
too, a metabolic response did not always correlate with an
imaging response. Consistent with Tabernero et al40 who
showed almost complete inhibition of mTOR function at
everolimus doses  50 mg weekly, metabolic responses
were observed in most of our patients at this dose. The
imaging findings thus provide a pharmacodynamic
marker that may be useful to assess combinations of novel
agents that target metabolism.
