The initiation and maintenance of a malignant phenotype requires complex and synergistic interactions of multiple oncogenic
signals. The Hedgehog (HH)/GLI pathway has been implicated in a variety of cancer entities and targeted pathway inhibition is of
therapeutic relevance. Signal cross-talk with other cancer pathways including PI3K/AKT modulates HH/GLI signal strength and its
oncogenicity. In this study, we addressed the role of HH/GLI and its putative interaction with the PI3K/AKT cascade in the initiation
and maintenance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Using transgenic mouse models, we show that B-cell-speciﬁc constitutive
activation of HH/GLI signaling either at the level of the HH effector and drug target Smoothened or at the level of the GLI
transcription factors does not sufﬁce to initiate a CLL-like phenotype characterized by the accumulation of CD5+ B cells in the
lymphatic system and peripheral blood. Furthermore, Hh/Gli activation in Pten-deﬁcient B cells with activated Pi3K/Akt signaling
failed to enhance the expansion of leukemic CD5+ B cells, suggesting that genetic or epigenetic alterations leading to aberrant
HH/GLI signaling in B cells do not sufﬁce to elicit a CLL-like phenotype in mice. By contrast, we identify a critical role of GLI and PI3K
signaling for the survival of human primary CLL cells. We show that combined targeting of GLI and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling can
have a synergistic therapeutic effect in cells from a subgroup of CLL patients, thereby providing a basis for the evaluation of future
combination therapies targeting HH/GLI and PI3K signaling in this common hematopoietic malignancy.

INTRODUCTION
Hedgehog (HH)/GLI signaling has multiple etiologic roles in the
initiation and progression of a variety of human cancers by
regulating critical oncogenic traits such as cell proliferation,
survival, metastasis and cancer stem cell fate.1–5
Activation and regulation of HH/GLI signaling is a complex
molecular process. Control of pathway activity occurs at multiple
levels within the signal cascade and frequently also involves crosstalk and signal integration with other pathways, thereby modifying the output of HH signaling (reviewed in refs 6–14).
Canonical HH signaling is activated upon binding of HH protein
(either Sonic, Indian or Desert Hedgehog) to its receptor Patched
(Ptch), a 12-transmembrane domain protein actively repressing
the pathway in the absence of ligand by preventing the activation
of the essential HH effector Smoothened (Smo). Binding of Hh to
Ptch results in translocation of Smo into the primary cilium,
followed by Smo activation and downstream signaling. Active
ciliary Smo induces HH target gene expression by promoting the
formation of the activator forms of the GLI zinc-ﬁnger transcription factors GLI3, GLI2 and GLI1 (for review see Hui et al.15 and
Ruiz i Altaba et al.16 and references therein).
In addition to classical SMO-dependent regulation of GLI, SMOindependent control of GLI activity has recently emerged as crucial
regulatory step in several human malignancies. For instance, GLI
activation can be directly controlled by atypical protein kinase C in
basal cell carcinoma, TGFβ/SMAD in pancreatic cancer or by the
EWS-FLI1 oncogene in Ewing´s Sarcoma.17–20 Furthermore, activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (for example, EGFR and PDGFRA)

and their downstream effectors including RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/AKT signaling enhance GLI activity by promoting GLI stability,
nuclear import and transcriptional activity.21–29 Importantly, the
identiﬁcation of signals involved in Smo-independent GLI regulation has guided the development of rationale-based treatments
also targeting GLI-promoting signals including atypical protein
kinase C, PI3K/AKT and EGFR/PDGFR. This strategy proved
particularly efﬁcient in preclinical models of basal cell carcinoma,
medulloblastoma, melanoma, pancreatic and esophageal cancer,
even for SMO-inhibitor-resistant cancers.17,21,24,28–31
The therapeutic relevance and role of HH/GLI in the development and growth of various hematological malignancies has been
demonstrated in several studies.32–40 However, the precise
molecular–pathologic role of HH/GLI and its cross-talk with other
oncogenic signals in entities such as chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) is less well understood and partially
controversial.6,33,41,42 CLL is an abundant B-cell malignancy in
the Western population, which typically manifests as an accumulation of CD5+ leukemic B cells in the peripheral blood (PB), bone
marrow (BM) and secondary lymphoid organs.43,44 Of note,
survival of CLL cells critically depends on a complex molecular
signal cross-talk between the leukemic cells with accessory
immune and stromal cells as well as on B-cell receptor signaling
(reviewed in Burger et al.45 and Stevenson et al.46). These
interactions trigger multiple signaling cascades within the CLL
cells including Protein Kinase C and PI3K/AKT signaling, the
latter of which having a crucial role in the survival of CLL cells.41

recently been approved for the treatment of relapsed CLL
patients.47,48
As for the implication of HH/GLI in CLL Hegde et al.42 suggested
a classical SMO-dependent HH/GLI signaling mechanism where
stromal cells produce HH ligand that acts on leukemic cells in a
paracrine manner. Inhibition of stroma-derived HH signaling using
SMO inhibitors reduced survival of CLL cells.42 Our own studies
also provided evidence for a pro-survival role of HH/GLI in CLL,
although we found SMO-independent activation of GLI transcription factors to be critical for the survival of CLL cells.41 A more
detailed analysis of CLL patients with distinct genetic aberrations
revealed a critical role for SMO-dependent HH/GLI signaling only
in CLL patients harboring the genomic aberration trisomy 12,33
which characterizes a CLL subgroup with high cell proliferation,
enriched Notch1 mutations and an increased frequency to the
aggressive Richter’s transformation.49
Despite some discrepancies in the mechanisms by which
HH/GLI contributes to CLL, the pro-survival role of the pathway in
CLL maintenance is generally well accepted. By contrast, it is
unclear whether aberrant oncogenic HH/GLI signaling is able and
sufﬁcient to also initiate a CLL-like phenotype and whether crosstalk of HH/GLI and PI3K signaling, a highly promising drug target in
CLL therapy,47,50 does have a role in CLL. As model of choice to
address whether aberrant HH/GLI activation is sufﬁcient for the
initiation of a CLL-like phenotype, we took a genetic approach using
conditional transgenic mouse models to activate Hh/Gli signaling in
mouse CD19+ B cells either at the level of Smo or at the level of Gli.
In addition, we addressed whether Hh/Gli and constitutive Pi3k/Akt
signaling interact and synergize to drive a leukemic phenotype.
Analysis of transgenic mice harboring single Hh/Gli or combined
Hh/Gli–Pi3k/Akt-activating mutations in CD19+ B cells did not
reveal a role for Hh/Gli in the initiation process of a CLL-like
phenotype. However, we show that GLI and PI3K functions are
required for survival of established human CLL cells, thereby
providing a basis for the future evaluation of rational combination
treatments simultaneously targeting GLI and PI3K/AKT in CLL
patients.
RESULTS
Constitutive Hh/Gli pathway activation in CD19+ B cells does not
initiate a CLL-like phenotype in mice
For B-cell-speciﬁc activation of Hh/Gli signaling, we crossed the
B-cell-speciﬁc cre recombinase deleter strain CD19cre with
R26SmoM2 mice carrying a conditional oncogenic Smoothened
allele (SmoM2; Figure 1a). CD19cre/+;R26SmoM2 mice, hitherto
referred to as SmoM2Bact, express in CD19+ B cells high levels of
the SmoM2 transgene transcript and, importantly, also elevated
levels of the Hh target genes Gli1 and Hhip, indicating B-cellspeciﬁc Hh pathway activation (Figure 1b).
Accumulation of CD5+/CD19+ cells in the lymphatic system and
PB is characteristic of a CLL-like phenotype. In Eμ-Tcl1 transgenic
mice, a well-established mouse model of CLL,51 the increase in
CD5+/CD19+ cells occurs ﬁrst in the PC as early as 2 months after
birth with an initial establishment of the leukemic phenotype at
the age of ~ 8–10 months.51 To address whether persistent B-cellspeciﬁc activation of Hh/Gli alone is able to trigger a CLL-like
phenotype, we analyzed by ﬂow cytometry the number of CD5+/
CD19+ cells in CD19cre/+ control mice and SmoM2Bact mice at the
age of 10 months and also at earlier time points (that is, 12 weeks
and 5 months after birth; Supplementary Figure S1A–F).
As shown in Figure 1c, B-cell-speciﬁc activation of oncogenic
SmoM2 signaling is not sufﬁcient to induce a CLL-like phenotype.
We did not detect any signiﬁcant difference in the amount of
CD5+/CD19+ cells in the peritoneal cavity (PC), BM and PB of
control (ctrl) and SmoM2Bact mice. Only in the spleen of 10-monthold (Figure 1c; 1.8% in control versus 3.5% in SmoM2Bact mice)
Oncogene (2015) 5341 – 5351

and the PC of 5-month-old SmoM2Bact mice (Supplementary Figure
S1B) did we detect a subtle increase in CD5+/CD19+ cells. We also
analyzed CD19+ B2 cells in the BM, spleen and PB of CD19cre/+;
R26SmoM2 mice but did not detect any signiﬁcant changes in the
amount of B2 cells compared with CD19cre/+ control mice (data not
shown).
Given the lack of substantial CD5+ B-cell accumulation as
described for other murine CLL models, we conclude that
constitutive Hh/Gli signaling induced by B-cell-speciﬁc SmoM2
expression is insufﬁcient for the initiation of a full-blown CLL-like
phenotype in mice.
An alternative explanation for the inability of SmoM2 to expand
CD5+/CD19+ cells may be its moderate activity as HH pathway
activator.52 In addition, Smo signaling strictly depends on the
presence of a functional primary cilium, an antenna-like organelle
protruding from the cell surface and acting as critical organizing
center of classical Smo-dependent Hh/Gli signaling.53–55 The
primary cilium represents a feature characteristic mainly of
adherent cell types, whereas cells of the hematopoietic system
are typically considered to lack a primary cilium (reviewed in
Finetti et al.56).
We therefore deployed an alternative genetic model, allowing
us to activate in B cells Smo-independent high-level Hh signaling
at the level of the Gli transcription factors by expression of a
dominant active version of the Gli2 transcriptional activator
referred to as ΔNGli2. For this purpose, we crossed CD19cre/+ mice
with Cleg2 mice carrying a conditional ΔNGli2 allele57 (Figure 2a),
yielding a progeny with B-cell-speciﬁc activation of Gli2 activator
expression (ΔNGli2Bact mice). CD19+ B cells of ΔNGli2Bact mice
express high levels of ΔNGli2 mRNA and increased levels of the
Hh/Gli targets Gli1 and Hhip when compared with CD19+ cells of
CD19cre/+ control mice (ctrl), demonstrating Smo-independent
Hh/Gli pathway activation at the level of the Gli transcription
factors (Figure 2b).
Analysis of CD5+/CD19+ cells in ΔNGli2Bact mice revealed a
similar phenotype as described for SmoM2Bact mice (Figure 2c). We
did not observe a signiﬁcant change of CD5+ B cells in ΔNGli2Bact
mice in the PC with 11.9% in the control and 9.9% in the ΔNGli2Bact
mice. Similarly, the number of CD5+ B cells in the BM, the spleen
and the PB did not change signiﬁcantly (Figure 2c). In addition, the
weight of spleens from SmoM2Bact and ΔNGli2Bact mice was
comparable to CD19cre/+ control mice and the number of B1b cells
and B2 cells remained constant in SmoM2Bact and ΔNGli2Bact mice
(data not shown). We conclude that mere activation of
constitutive HH signaling at the level of Smo or at the level of
Gli is insufﬁcient to initiate a CLL-like phenotype in mice.
Pten deletion and simultaneous Hh/Gli activation do not
cooperate in the initiation of a CLL-like phenotype in mice
PI3K/AKT signaling constitutes a critical signaling axis with
relevance to CLL therapy.46,47,50 Of note, mice with B-cell-speciﬁc
activation of Pi3k/Akt by genetic deletion of Pten showed
increased numbers of CD5+-positive B cells, although they did
not progress to a full-blown disease, suggesting that additional
genetic/epigenetic alterations are required for malignant
transformation.58 As PI3K/AKT has been shown to enhance the
oncogenic HH/GLI signal strength,26,28,29,59 we hypothesized that
combined B-cell-speciﬁc activation of Pi3k/Akt and Hh/Gli may
result in transformation of B cells into a CLL-like disease in mice.
To genetically test this hypothesis, we crossed SmoM2Bactmice
or ΔNGli2Bact mice to Ptenﬂox/ﬂox mice, yielding mice with
combined B-cell-speciﬁc activation of either SmoM2 and Pi3k/
Akt (PtenΔB;SmoM2Bact; Figure 3a) or ΔNGli2 and Pi3k/Akt signaling
(PtenΔB; ΔNGli2Bact; Figure 4a). Activation of Pi3k/Akt signaling in
response to CD19cre-mediated Pten deletion was veriﬁed by
phospho-Akt (pS473) analysis in CD19+ cells of compound
transgenic mice (data not shown).

note, B-cell-speciﬁc deletion of Pten did not signiﬁcantly affect Gli1

promoting Gli protein stability, nuclear import and/or by
releasing Gli from its negative regulator suppressor of fused
via mTOR/S6K activation.26,28,29 We therefore also tested
whether combined Pi3k/Akt signaling and Gli activator expression cooperate in the transformation of CD19+ B cells. For
this, we generated PtenΔB; ΔNGli2Bact mice with B-cell-speciﬁc
deletion of Pten and concomitant expression of dominant
active Gli2 (Figure 4a). We could again conﬁrm the increase in
CD5+/CD19+ cells in PtenΔB mice (Figure 4b–e). However, and
similar to results of PtenΔB;SmoM2Bact mice, Gli2 activation in
combination with Pten deletion did not further enhance the
amount of CD5+/CD19+ cells in the PC and spleen compared with
CD19cre/+ control mice (Figure 4b and c). Surprisingly, however,
Gli2 activator expression reversed the increase in CD5+/CD19+
cells in the BM and PB of PtenΔB mice (Figure 4d and e), pointing to
an unexplained negative impact of Gli2 activator on Pi3k/Akt in
CD5+/CD19+ cells.

Combined targeting of GLI and PI3K/AKT reduces survival of
human CLL cells
Although we did not ﬁnd evidence for Hh/Gli–Pi3k/Akt cooperation in the establishment of a CLL-like disease in mice, pathway
interaction may well occur in established CLL. We have previously
uncovered a critical SMO-independent role of GLI activator for the
survival of human CLL cells.41 Likewise, PI3K/AKT signaling is
frequently active in CLL and targeting PI3K in CLL patients
currently emerges as a novel targeted therapy with unprecedented efﬁcacy.47,50 We therefore hypothesized that GLI and PI3K/
AKT may cooperate in established CLL cells to synergistically
promote survival, which would open new avenues for rational
combination therapy. To test for GLI–PI3K interactions, we
performed single and combined chemical and genetic inhibition
experiments of GLI and PI3K signaling, followed by monitoring the
effects on CLL cell survival via ﬂow cytometry of Annexin V/7AADstained cells. As cellular model for assessing putative GLI–PI3K/AKT

interactions, we ﬁrst used the CLL-derived cell line MEC1,60 which
displays both GLI and PI3K/AKT activation Desch et al.41(Figure 5a).
To inhibit PI3K activity, we treated MEC1 cells with the pan-PI3K
inhibitors dactolisib or pictilisib.61,62 Both compound effectively
inhibited PI3K signaling in MEC1 CLL cells as evidenced by
efﬁcient abrogation of AKT phosphorylation (Figure 5a). We tested
for synergistic reduction of CLL survival by combining PI3K
inhibitors with the GLI antagonist GANT61.63 In single treatment
settings, PI3K inhibition reduced CLL cell survival by ~ 30%.
Treatment with GANT61 had a less pronounced, yet signiﬁcant,
negative effect on CLL survival, consistent with our previous
data.41 Combined inhibition of PI3K and GLI enhanced the single
treatment effect to up to 50% reduction of survival (combination
GANT61/dactolisib). However, statistical testing for synergistic
interactions of GANT61 and dactolisib did not reach signiﬁcance.
In line with enhanced reduction of MEC1 survival by targeting GLI
and PI3K, combined GANT61/dactolisib treatment was more
Oncogene (2015) 5341 – 5351

efﬁcient in inhibiting GLI1 mRNA expression than single treatments (Supplementary Figure S3). We also evaluated the possible
therapeutic efﬁcacy of combined PI3K and GLI targeting by
lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of GLI1 and GLI2,
either alone or in combination with dactolisib. In line with our
previous data,41 inhibition of GLI1 or GLI2 signiﬁcantly reduced
CLL survival. Inhibition of PI3K signaling in combination with GIL1
or GLI2 knockdown further reduced CLL survival, although again
synergy did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.
As MEC1 cells do not fully represent the molecular and genetic
features of CLL cells, we tested the clinical relevance of our
ﬁndings by analyzing the survival of primary human CLL cells in
response to single or combined targeting of GLI and PI3K
signaling. In total, we analyzed the effect of single and combined
GLI–PI3K targeting on primary CD19+/CD5+ leukemic cell survival
of a total of 14 CLL patients (for summary, see Supplemenatry
Tables S1 and S2). To inhibit PI3K activity, we treated cultured

Figure 5. Efﬁcient inhibition of CLL survival by combined targeting of GLI and PI3K/AKT signaling. (a) Human MEC1 CLL cells display activated
PI3K/AKT signaling, as evidenced by expression of phopho-AKT (pAKT; pS473) in control-treated cells (solvent only). Inhibition of PI3K
signaling either by dactolisib (1 μM) or pictilisib (1 μM) both abrogated AKT activation. (b) Single and combined GLI and PI3K/AKT targeting
reduces CLL survival. Statistical analysis of single versus combined treatments did not reveal signiﬁcant synergistic interactions of the GLI and
PI3K inhibitor drugs. CLL cells were treated for 72 h with 10 μM GANT61 and/or 1 μM dactosilib/1 μM pictilisib before 7AAD/Annexin V staining
and multicolor ﬂow cytometry analysis. (c) Genetic perturbation of GLI1 and GLI2 in MEC1 CLL cells by stable lentiviral shRNA both strongly
reduced survival. Control cells were transduced with nontarget control shRNA. Dactosilib treatment of GLI1 and GLI2 knockdown cells led to a
further decrease in the number of viable cells, yet synergistic interaction of GLI1/2 depletion and PI3K targeting did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance. Data represent the mean values of three independent biological replicate experiments, error bars indicate the s.e.m.

primary CLL cells with dactolisib, pictilisib or wortmannin64 either
alone or in combination with GANT61. We also analyzed the effect
of combined treatment with GANT61 and rapamycin, a potent
inhibitor of the PI3K effector mTOR.65 Notably, six patient samples
were highly sensitive to combined GLI–PI3K and/or GLI-mTOR
targeting, but only moderately to single treatments (that is, 1753,
7579, 7643, 7644, 7889 and 7890 (Figure 5d and e); also see
Supplemenatry Table S1). As shown in Figure 5d, combination
treatment of four primary CLL samples (patient ID 7643, 7644,
7889 and 7890) with GANT61/dactolisib or GANT61/pictilisib
synergistically enhanced CLL apoptosis by more than 65%,
whereas single treatment protocols reduced survival by only less
than 30% compared with controls. Further, combination treatment with GANT61 and rapamycin (Rapa) synergistically reduced
survival of four primary CLL samples (Figure 5e, patient ID 1753,
7579, 7643 and 7644), two of which were also highly sensitive to
GLI/PI3K targeting (ID 7643 and 7644; see Supplementary
Table S1). The heterogeneity of treatment responses is further
shown in Figure 5f. CLL cells of three patients (ID 544, 7538 and
7632) were essentially resistant to single and combined GLI/mTOR
targeting, whereas ﬁve patient samples were mainly sensitive to
GLI targeting, with no further enhancement of apoptosis by
concomitant PI3K inhibition (patient ID 7530, 7577, 7913, 7914
and 7915, also see Supplemenatry Table S1).
Together, these results suggest that PI3K/mTOR signaling and
GLI proteins can cooperate in a fraction of CLL patients to
promote CLL cell survival.
DISCUSSION
Oncogenic HH/GLI signaling accounts for the development and
progression of a number of human cancers (for review see
Teglund and Toftgard5 and references therein). Its clinical
relevance has been convincingly evidenced by the striking
therapeutic efﬁcacy of HH pathway inhibitors targeting SMO for
the treatment of patients suffering from HH-driven basal cell
carcinoma or medulloblastoma.66–70 However, the rapid development of drug resistance30,31,66,71 as well as noncanonical SMOindependent activation of GLI call for a detailed molecular analysis
of HH/GLI and interacting oncogenic pathways to develop better
treatment strategies.
The causal involvement of the HH/GLI pathway in malignancies
of the hematopoietic system such as B-cell malignancies including
CLL has previously been reported,33,34,41,42 although its precise
role is not fully understood, partly also because of the lack of
sophisticated mouse models mimicking oncogenic Hh/Gli and
signal cross-talk speciﬁcally in B cells. We therefore generated and
analyzed transgenic mice with conditional B-cell-speciﬁc activation of Hh/Gli signaling alone or in combination with oncogenic
PI3K signaling, an emerging and highly promising therapeutic
target in CLL patients known to promote GLI activity.47,50
Several groups have addressed the role of HH/GLI in CLL, yet its
involvement in CLL is poorly deﬁned. CLL cell survival critically
depends on signals derived from the surrounding tumor stroma.
Hegde et al.42 showed that stroma-derived Sonic HH protein is
likely to protect CLL cells from apoptosis, suggesting paracrine
and SMO-dependent activation of HH signaling in CLL cells. By
contrast, our own previous study identiﬁed non-canonical, SMOindependent activation of GLI transcription factors in CLL cells as a
crucial pro-survival signal,41 a ﬁnding in line with another report
on the absence of HH expression in the lymph node stroma of
CLL patients.72 The controversial results may also be because of
the highly diverse expression of HH pathway members in CLL.
Indeed, sensitivity to SMO inhibitors correlates only with high HH
target gene levels and a trisomy 12 karyotype.33 In essence and
despite these discrepancies, the results clearly support a critical
role of HH pathway effectors particularly of GLI in established CLL.
Oncogene (2015) 5341 – 5351

Whether HH/GLI signaling does have a role in the initiation of
CLL has not been addressed so far. The results of our present
study do not support a critical contribution of Hh/Gli in triggering
a CLL-like phenotype in mice, as evidenced by the lack of a
substantial and systemic increase in CD5+/CD19+ B cells in
response to pathway activation. We also propose that the
apparent lack of a signiﬁcant response to Hh/Gli activation in B
cells is not simply because of the absence of a primary cilium on
hematopoietic cells, on which SMO critically depends.53,56 First, we
detected activation of Hh/Gli target genes in B cells expressing
constitutively active SmoM2. Second, we did not observe
signiﬁcant changes in CD5+ B-cell numbers in mice with B-cellspeciﬁc expression of dominant active Gli2, activating Hh/Gli
downstream of Smo independently of a primary cilium. That said,
expression of active SMO led to a subtle increase in CD5+ B cells in
the spleen, with a similar yet non-signiﬁcant trend in the BM. This
may point to a possible involvement of HH/GLI in the proliferative
niches of CLL cells, which may be boosted by additional driver
mutations. We therefore tested for a possible interaction of HH/
GLI and PI3K/AKT signaling, as (i) PI3K/AKT has been shown to
cooperate with HH/GLI in cancer,28,30,31,59 (ii) PI3K is frequently
activated in CLL41 and PI3K targeting is highly effective in the
treatment of CLL patients47,50 and (iii) mice with Pten-deﬁcient B
cells display a systemic expansion of CD5+ B cells without
progressing to a full-blown CLL-like phenotype as Eμ-Tcl1
transgenic mice do.58 Furthermore, transgenic expression of the
AKT enhancer TCL1 in immature and mature murine B cells
induces a CLL-like phenotype that presents with an expansion of
CD5+ B cells in the PC, and later on the accumulation of leukemic
cells in the BM, spleen and PB.51,73
We found that activation of Hh/Gli in B cells with Pi3K/Akt
activation does not promote the expansion of CD5+ B cells, again
suggesting that Hh/Gli does not have a major role in the early
initiation phase of a CLL-like phenotype in mice. In summary, we
propose that B-cell-speciﬁc activation of Hh/Gli signaling, even in
combination with Pi3k/Akt, does not sufﬁce to elicit a malignant
B-cell phenotype in mice. It may, however, be possible that Hh/Gli
provides a permissive signal being required for the establishment
of a malignant CLL-like phenotype. This will be an important
question to be addressed in future studies and will require genetic
and pharmacological inactivation of Hh/Gli signaling in sophisticated in vivo CLL models such as Eμ-Tcl1 transgenic mice.51
In contrast to the initiation and onset of CLL, PI3K/AKT and GLI
activation is crucial in established CLL, mainly supporting the
survival of malignant cells.41,74,75 We therefore addressed the
possible cooperation of GLI and PI3K/AKT in CLL survival. We ﬁrst
conﬁrm the importance of GLI activator forms (GLI1/GLI2) and
PI3K/AKT signaling for CLL survival and, second, show that
combined GLI and PI3K/AKT inhibition in primary CLL cells
strongly reduces CLL survival in an undeﬁned subgroup of CLL
patients. This may open up new opportunities for future rationalebased combination treatments relying on simultaneous targeting
of GLI and PI3K. Such a strategy may even further enhance and/or
prolong the striking therapeutic beneﬁt of PI3K targeting.47,50 In
this context it is noteworthy that arsenic trioxide—an efﬁcient
therapeutic for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia76
—induces apoptosis of CLL cells even from patients with poor
prognosis.77 As arsenic trioxide is able to inhibit both PI3K/AKT
signaling and GLI activator forms,78–81 its efﬁcacy in triggering
apoptosis may be the result of combined targeting of PI3K/AKT
and GLI.
In summary, our present study suggests a critical role of PI3K/
AKT and GLI activator forms in the survival of established CLL
rather than in the initiation of the disease phenotype and warrants
further investigation into combined targeting of GLI–PI3K using
recently validated and promising GLI inhibitors such as arsenic
trioxide or atypical protein kinase C antagonists.17,78

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Transgenic mice and genotyping
All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the national
requirements. All transgenic lines were maintained on a C57BL/6
N background for at least 10 generations. CD19cre mice82 with a knock-in
allele of cre recombinase in the CD19 gene locus and R26SmoM2 mice83
carrying a conditional SmoM2 allele under control of the Rosa26 promoter
were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) (JAX
strains B6.129P2(C)-Cd19tm1(cre)Cgn/J and Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(Smo/EYFP)
Amc/J). Conditional PTENﬂox/ﬂox mice were kindly provided by Professors
Tak Mak and Josef Penninger.84 Cleg2 mice carry a conditional transgenic
allele of a dominant active version of GLI2.57
PCR genotyping of CD19cre mice was performed using the following
primers: forward 5′-GCGGTCTGGCAGTAAAAACTATC-3′ and reverse 5′-GTG
AAACAGCATTGCTGTCACTT-3′. Genotyping of ﬂoxed PTEN mice was
carried out using forward 5′-GTCACCAGGATGCTTCTGAC-3′ and reverse
5′-GAAACGGCCTTAACGACGTAG-3′ primers, for wild-type controls we used
forward 5′-GTCACCAGGATGCTTCTGAC-3′ and reverse 5′-GTGACATCAACAT
GCAACACTG-3′ primers. Genotyping of the SmoM2 allele was accomplished using the following oligonucleotide primers: forward 5′-CTGACCC
TGAAGTTCATCTGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GTGCGCTCCTGGACGTAG-3′. The
wild-type was genotyped with forward 5′-CGTGATCTGCAACTCCAGTC-3′
and reverse 5′-GGAGCGGGAGAAATGGATATG-3′ primers.
Transgenic GLI2 was detected using the following primers: forward
5′-CCCGCCTGGAGAACCTGAAGACAC-3′ and reverse 5′-CCCCGGGGCTGGA
CTGACAC-3′.

Flow cytometry and apoptosis assays
Peritoneal cells were isolated by peritoneal lavage. Spleen cells were
puriﬁed by maceration through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA) and separation on a lymphocyte separation medium
gradient (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Samples were washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline before staining. PB cells were incubated with
Red Blood Lysis Buffer and washed twice before staining. BM cells were
macerated through a 40-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) and washed
twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Peritoneal cells, spleen cells, PB
and BM cells were stained with the following antibodies: CD5-PE,
CD19-FITC (Immunotools, Friesoythe, Germany), IgM-APC (BD Biosciences),
CD23-PerCP-Cy7 and/or CD11b-APC (Biolegends, San Diego, CA, USA).
CD16/32 Antibody (Biolegends) was used to prevent unspeciﬁc binding to
FcγIII and FcγII receptors. To analyze cell survival and apoptosis,
respectively, CLL cells were stained with Annexin-V-FITC (Immunotools),
7-Aminoactinomycin D (7AAD, BD Biosciences) and the surface markers
CD19-APC (Immunotools). All ﬂow cytometry analyses were performed on a
BD FACS Canto II and data were analyzed with the BD FACS Diva Software
(BD Biosciences).

RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the Micro RNA Kit (Life Technologies, Vienna,
Austria) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA from MEC cells
were isolated using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati,
OH, USA) followed by a LiCl precipitation step for enrichment of highly
pure RNA. Reverse transcription of RNA was performed using the
Superscript II (Life Technologies) and quantitative real-time PCR was
performed on a Rotor gene 3000 Cycler (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using
Sybr Green (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) as described previously.41

Cell culture and inhibitor treatments
All work with primary human material was performed in compliance with
the national and local regulations. Primary CLL cells were isolated from PB
and BM of CLL patients via Biocoll (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) density
gradient centrifugation and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (62.5 μg/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml)
at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. MEC1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA)
were cultured in IMDM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin
and streptomycin. Cells were split twice a week at a density of 106 cells per
ml medium. For lentiviral packaging, HEK293FT (ATCC) cells were grown in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies),
penicillin and streptomycin, L-glutamate (100x concentrate, Life Technologies) and essential amino acids (100 × concentrate, Life Technologies)
and split three times a week in a ratio of 1:5. Dactolisib, pictilisib,
rapamycin, wortmannin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA, USA) and GANT61

(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, stored
as stock solution at − 20 and diluted to ﬁnal concentrations as indicated in
the Results section.

RNA interference experiments
Lentiviral shRNA knockdown experiments in MEC1 cells were performed as
described in Desch et al.41 and lentiviral production and transduction
following the protocol published by Kasper et al.,85 except that packaging
plasmid transfection was carried out using Metafectene Pro (Biontex
GmbH, Planegg, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The following lentiviral shRNA constructs (Sigma-Aldrich mission TRC library,
Sigma) were used: shGLI1 (TRCN0000020486), shGLI2 (TRCN0000238361) and
nontarget control shRNA (shc002). Efﬁcient knockdown of GLI1 and GLI2 was
veriﬁed by quantitative PCR (data not shown).

Western blot analysis
Protein detection was performed using the SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) and
Hyperﬁlm ECL ﬁlms (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK). Antibodies against Akt
and phospho-Akt (pS473) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, USA).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses (two-way analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni
or unpaired t-test for normally distributed data, respectively, Mann–
Whitney test or Kruskal–Wallis test for non-normally distributed data) were
performed using SPSS 22 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). Effects were
considered signiﬁcant at P ⩽ 0.05 with *P ⩽ 0.05; **P ⩽ 0.001; ***P ⩽ 0.0001.
