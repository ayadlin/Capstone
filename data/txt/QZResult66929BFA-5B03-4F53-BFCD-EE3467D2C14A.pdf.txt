ABSTRACT
SET oncoprotein is an endogenous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A),
and SET-mediated PP2A inhibition is an important regulatory mechanism for
promoting cancer initiation and progression of several types of human leukemia
disease. However, its potential relevance in solid tumors as non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) remains mostly unknown. In this study, we showed that SET was evidently
overexpressed in human NSCLC cell lines and NSCLC tissues. Clinicopathologic analysis
showed that SET expression was significantly correlated with clinical stage (p <
0.001), and lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that
patients with high SET expression had poorer overall survival rates than those with
low SET expression. Moreover, knockdown of SET in NSCLC cells resulted in attenuated
proliferative and invasive abilities. The biological effect of SET on proliferation and
invasion was mediated by the inhibition of the PP2A, which in turn, activation of
AKT and ERK, increased the expression of cyclin D1 and MMP9, and decreased the
expression of p27. Furthermore, we observed that restoration of PP2A using SET
antagonist FTY720 impaired proliferative and invasive potential in vitro, as well as
inhibited tumor growth in vivo of NSCLC cells. Taken together, SET oncoprotein plays
an important role in NSCLC progression, which could serve as a potential prognosis
marker and a novel therapeutic target for NSCLC patients.

INTRODUCTION

regulation of phosphatase and kinase activity in cancer
cells [4-6]. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), one of the
main serine-threonine phosphatases, maintains cell
homoeostasis by counteracting most of the kinase-driven
intracellular signaling pathways [7]. PP2A has been
shown to be genetically altered or functionally inactivated
in many solid cancers and leukemia, and inhibition of
PP2A activity or loss of some of its functional subunits is
critical to promote cell transformation, tumor progression,
and angiogenesis, which indicates that PP2A has tumor
suppressive roles [7-9]. Consistent with its role as a tumor
suppressor, PP2A plays a critical role in the regulation
of cell-cycle progression, survival, and differentiation
by negatively regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway [10,
11], and dephosphorylating and inactivating MEK1 and

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer
deaths world-wide, and non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancer
diagnoses [1]. In spite of advances in developing more
efficient surgical techniques and novel chemotherapeutic
interventions, as well as targeted therapies, the longterm survival rate of NSCLC patients remains poor
[2, 3]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for further
understanding of the molecular mechanisms in lung cancer
initiation and progression, and for identifying effective
prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers and new therapeutic
targets to improve the prognosis of patients.
Recent evidence suggests that there is a tight

ERK family kinases [12, 13], or decreasing the stability
and function of c-MYC transcription factors [14, 15].
Therefore, reactivation of PP2A activity base on its tumor
suppressor properties is considered to be an attractive
therapeutic strategy for human cancer treatment [16-18].
SET oncoprotein, also known as I2PP2A, is a
potent physiologic inhibitor of PP2A [19]. SET protein
directly binds with PP2Ac through its both N-terminus
and C-terminus regions, and inhibits PP2A phosphatase
activity [20]. The SET oncoprotein participates in the
regulation of a wide variety of molecular processes
[21-24]. Of importance, SET plays an oncogenic role
modulating signaling pathways with high relevance in
human cancer [25]. Several studies showed that SET
was up-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia [26], head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [27],
colorectal cancer [25], and breast cancer [28]. Increased
accumulation of the SET oncoprotein in these cancer cells
accounts for decreased PP2A activity, and overexpression
of SET promotes cell proliferation, survival, drug
resistance, invasion and metastasis [25, 29-31]. Notably,
restoration of PP2A activity through silencing of SET,
or pharmacologic activation by SET antagonist FTY720
(fingolimod) resulted in reduced tumorigenesis in vitro
and in vivo [32-36]. However, currently, little information
has addressed the clinical significance of SET and the
molecular mechanisms by which SET promotes the tumor
progression of NSCLC.
In the present study, we found that SET expression
was significantly increased in NSCLC cells and tissues,
and was closely associated with tumor progression and
poor prognosis. Knockdown of SET significantly inhibited
the proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro via
activation of PP2A activities, and inhibition the AKT and
ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, SET antagonist
FTY720 treatment increased PP2A activity, impaired cell
proliferation, clonogenic potential and tumor growth of
NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide strong
evidences that overexpression of SET was an independent
prognostic factor for NSCLC patients, and inhibition of
SET could be a promising therapeutic target in NSCLC.

immunohistochemistry analysis in 163 NSCLC specimens
and 42 adjacent normal tissues and found that SET was
overexpressed in 91.4% of tumor samples (149 of 163).
While the adjacent normal tissues exhibited undetectable
or low SET staining (Figure 1C and 1D). These results
indicated that SET might be a critical molecule in lung
cancer development.
Next, we analyzed the relationship between SET
expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics.
As shown in Table 1, no statistically significant
correlations were observed between the expression of
SET expression and gender, or age at diagnosis (P > 0.05).
However, statistically significant correlations between
high levels of SET expression were found with advanced
TNM stage (P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P =
0.017).
To evaluate the prognostic value of SET expression
in NSCLC, we divided the NSCLC patients into SET high
and low expression groups based on a ROC curve cutoff
score of 5. The expression of SET in each sample was
subsequently classified as either high level (score â‰¥ 5)
or low level (score < 5). Survival analysis revealed that
NSCLC patients with high SET expression had poorer
overall survival than those with low SET expression (P
< 0.01; Figure 1F). Altogether, our present data suggested
that SET is overexpressed in NSCLC and high level of
SET expression is a prognostic predictor of progression
and poor prognosis of NSCLC patients.

Knockdown of SET suppress NSCLC cell
proliferation and invasion
To investigate the biological effect of SET
deregulation on lung cancer cells, A549 and H460 cells
were transfected with SET siRNA and performed using
MTS, BrdU, and clonogenic assay. As shown in Figure
2, knockdown of SET (Figure 2A) significantly decreased
cell viability (Figure 2B) and decreased the Brdu positive
cells (Figure S1) in A549 and H460 cells compared to that
of the control group. Furthermore, colony formation was
also reduced after transfection with SET siRNA (Figure
2C).
In order to examine the role of SET in NSCLC
cell invasion and migratory, we evaluated the effect
of knockdown of SET on NSCLC cell invasion and
migratory by transwell assays. As shown in Figure 2D,
knockdown of SET drastically reduced the invasive ability
of A549 and H1975 cells compared to that of control.
Wound healing assay also showed that knockdown of SET
significantly decreased the migratory speed of H1975 cells
(Figure 2E).
Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of SET on the
expression of several proliferative and invasive protein
markers. Western blot analysis revealed that knockdown

all of NSCLC lines compared with BEAS-2B. We then

SET markedly enhanced the protein expression of cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p27 kip1, however suppressed
the protein expression of Cyclin D1, as well as decreased
the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9)
(Figure 2F). Altogether, our results demonstrated that
SET contributes greatly to the development of NSCLC
cell proliferation and invasion.

The SET oncoprotein participates in the regulation
of cellular molecular processes by inhibiting the tumor
suppressor PP2A [19]. Then, we analyzed whether SET
deregulation can alter the effects of the tumor suppressor
PP2A in NSCLS cells. As expected, we observed PP2A

activation after SET silencing (Figure 3A). To evaluate
whether SET induced cell proliferation and invasion is
due to inhibition of PP2A actiivity, we compared cell
proliferation, colony formation and cell invasion in SETsiRNA expressing A549 cells and its control cells in the
presence and absence of PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid
(O.acid). Our results showed that O.acid significantly
reversed the cell proliferation inhibited by SET siRNA
(Figure 3B, Figure S2). Moreover, the number of colonies
and invasive cells were also dramatically increased when
SET-siRNA expressing cells were separately treated with

O.acid (Figure 3C and 3D).
We next examined whether the inhibition of PP2A
had any effect in the phosphorylation status of previously
described PP2A targets. Consistent with previous reports
about the effects of PP2A activation in other tumor models
[12], knockdown of SET decreased phosphorylation of
the PP2A targets AKT and ERK1/2 without affecting
their expression levels (Figure 3E). Moreover, treatment
of O.acid rescued AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in
SET-knockdown A549 cells, as well as in SET-knockdown
H460 cells (Figure 3E). Of importance, treatment of

SET-knockdown A549 cells, but increased the expression
of p27. Similar results were also observed in H460 cells
(Figure 3E). Taken together, these findings suggested
that inhibition of PP2A is essential for SET-induced

also correlated with reduction of colony formation and
cell invasion (Figure 4C and 4D). Moreover, treatment
of FTY720 decreased the phosphorylation of AKT and
ERK1/2, as well as the expression of Cyclin D1 and
MMP9, but increased the expression of p27 (Figure 4E).
We further examined the ability of FTY720 to
suppress tumor growth in vivo. The therapeutic potential
of FTY720 against A549-xenografts generated in the
flanks of SCID mice was determined after intraperitoneal
administration of DMSO, or FTY720 (3â€‰mg/kg/day for 18
days, nâ€‰=â€‰9). As shown in Figure 5A, FTY720 significantly
inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts. Treatment
with FTY720 resulted in a significant decrease in tumor
volumes (263.8 Â± 64.6) compared to control group (825.5
Â± 81.2) (Figure 5B). The excised tumors from the control
group weighed between 1.72 g and 2.25 g, whereas these
from the FTY720-treated animals averaged ~ 0.68 g
(Figure 5C). In addition, tumors derived from mice treated
with FTY720 displayed higher PP2A activity (Figure S3)
and the expression of p27 (Figure 5D), but lower levels of

Antagonism of SET using FTY720 inhibits
NSCLC cell growth in vitro and in vivo
Recently, several studies reported that FTY720 and
its precursors selectively bind to SET and increase PP2A
activity [33, 34]. Therefore, we first evaluated the efficacy
of FTY720 against NSCLC cells. We found that the
treatment of FTY720 markedly increased PP2A activity
in A549 and H460 cells (Figure 4A). Importantly, FTY720
treatment significantly inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4B). Reduction in
viability of NSCLC cells after treatment with FTY720

including colorectal cancer [25], head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [27], colorectal cancer ,
and breast cancer [28], shows promising therapeutic
implications and determines poor clinical outcome. In
the present study, our data firstly demonstrated that SET
expression was up-regulated in human NSCLC tissues and
cultured NSCLC cells compared to that of normal lung
tissues and normal lung epithelial cells. Of important,
multivariate analysis indicated that SET may represent an
independent prognostic biomarker for NSCLC patients.
Collected evidence supports the idea that SET is
closely linked with tumor progression [35]. Notably, we
found that high SET expression was strongly correlated
with the clinical stages and lymph node metastasis in
NSCLC, which suggested that SET is closely associated
with NSCLC progression. It has been shown that SET
knockdown was shown to negatively affect tumorigenesis
in CML [32], and silence of SET with siRNAs in CRC
cell lines induced a decrease in the cell growth and
colonosphere formation ability in both number and size of
the spheres formed [25]. Similarly, our results showed that
SET knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation

DISCUSSION
In this report, our data provided the first evidences
that SET is overexpressed in NSCLC and contributes to
adverse clinical outcomes. We found that high expression
of SET was correlated with advanced tumor stages and
regional lymph node metastasis. We also showed that SET
is deregulated in NSCLC cell and plays an oncogenic role
promoting cell proliferation, colonosphere formation, and
invasiveness, and impairing PP2A antitumor activities.
Furthermore, our in vitro and in vivo results demonstrated
that the pharmacologic activation of PP2A by SET
antagonist FTY720 reduced cell viability and tumor
growth of NSCLC cells
SET has been reported to be up-regulated in CML
cells, resulting in decreased PP2A activity [32]. Similarly,
SET overexpression in patients with several solid tumor,

properties and colony formation in NSCLC cells, indicated
that SET deregulation is an alteration that plays a potential
oncogenic role of SET in NSCLC. Furthermore, we also
found that downregulation of SET inhibited NSCLC cell
invasion. The effect of SET on promoting the invasiveness
of NSCLC cells was verified the IHC results on the
significant correlations between SET expression and
lymph node metastasis in NSCLC patients.
PP2A is a key cellular serine-threonine phosphatase
and is an essential tumor suppressor [7, 37]. It has been
shown that deregulation of PP2A is a common event
in lung cancer [38, 39]. Animal studies also showed
that PR65Î± point mutations and deletions increase the
incidence of lung cancer [40]. The SET oncoprotein is
an important binding partner of PP2A with an inhibitory
function [19]. Our finding that SET is frequently
overexpressed in NSCLC cancers is novel and suggests
that deregulation of SET as a possible contributing
mechanism to inhibit PP2A, and overexpression of PP2A
inhibitors may play an important role in the development
of human NSCLC. Therefore, inhibition of SET could
be a viable strategy to posttranslational target PP2A and
inhibit tumor growth in NSCLC. Indeed, knockdown
of SET significantly increased the PP2A activity, and
decreased the level of PP2A targets pAKT and pERK, as
well as decreased the expression of Cyclin D and MMP9.
More important, inhibition of PP2A activity reversed these
above effects. Hence, inhibition of PP2A is essential for
SET-induced proliferation and invasion.
Previous work has demonstrated that the SET
antagonist FTY720 activates PP2A, is cytotoxic to
primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, and
decreases lymphoma xenograft tumor growth [41, 42].
Similar results from recently studies of treatment with
another SET inhibitor OP449 showed activation of
PP2A, as well as suppressed the tumor growth of cancer
[43, 44]. To explore the therapeutic potential for PP2A
activation through SET inhibition as an approach for
NSCLC therapy, we treated NSCLC cells with FTY720
and measured tumor growth and oncogenic potential in
vitro and in vivo. Consistent with the demonstrated ability
of FTY720 suppresses tumor growth; we observed that
FTY720 treatment resulted in decreased proliferation
and colony formation in vitro. Of importantly, FTY720
significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Therefore,
our results provided preclinical rationale for clinical
development of FTY720 for the treatment of NSCLC.
In summary, the results of this study showed that
SET overexpression is a recurrent molecular event that
plays an oncogenic role in NSCLC, and inhibition of
SET may provide an important therapeutic strategy
for the treatment of NSCLC by targeting PP2A, and
facilitate down-regulation of several PP2A-regulated
targets including AKT and ERK kinase, p27, cyclin D1,
and MMP9. Based on the functional characteristics and
cancer-specific expression, our results indicated that SET

oncoprotein could serve as a potential prognosis marker
and a novel therapeutic target for NSCLC patients.

RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10%
fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 IU/ml penicillin (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (Sigma) in a
humidified incubator of 5% CO2 at 37 Â°C..

Patients and specimens
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of Guangzhou Medical University. Primary tumor
specimens were obtained from 163 patients diagnosed
with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent complete
resection in the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Guangzhou
Medical University between 2002 and 2009. Follow-up
information was obtained from review of the patientsâ€™
medical record.

Immunohistochemistry
Surgically excised tumor specimens were fixed
with 10% neutral formalin, embedded in paraffin, and
4-Î¼m-thick sections were prepared. Immunostaining was
performed using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex
method (UltrasensitiveTM, MaiXin, Fuzhou, China). The
sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated with
graded alcohol, and then boiled in 0.01 M citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) for 2 min with an autoclave. Hydrogen peroxide

(0.3%) was applied to block endogenous peroxide activity,
and the sections were incubated with normal goat serum to
reduce nonspecific binding. Tissue sections were incubated
with SET rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:250 dilutions).
Staining for antibody was performed at room temperature
for 2 h. Biotinylated goat antimouse serum IgG was used
as a secondary antibody. After washing, the sections
were incubated with streptavidin-biotin conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase, and the peroxidase reaction was
developed with 3,3â€²-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride.
The intensity of SET staining was scored as 0
(no signal), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (marked).
Percentage scores were assigned as 1, 1-25%; 2, 26-50%;
3, 51-75%; and 4, 76-100%. The scores of each tumor
sample were multiplied to give a final score of 0-12, and
the tumors were finally determined as negative (âˆ’), score
0; lower expression (+), score â‰¤4; moderate expression
(++), score 5-8; and high expression (+++), score â‰¥9.
Tumor sample scored (+) to (+++) were considered
positive (overexpression). An optimal cutoff value was
identified: a staining index of five or greater was used to
define tumors of high expression, and four or lower for
low expression. The cutoff value for SET was chosen
based on a measure of heterogeneity using the log-rank
test statistical analysis with respect to overall survival. All
patients were followed up yearly, with the last follow-up
being conducted in September 2014. Of the 163 patients,
none of patients were lost to follow-up and seventeen
patients were alive at the final follow-up in September
2014.

BrdU cell proliferation assay
Cells were treated with 0.03 mg/ml BrdU for 6â€“12
h, at 37 Â°C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in
0.1 M PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) with 1%
Triton X-100, and incubated with 1 M Hcl (hydrochloric
acid) and 2 M Hcl. A borate buffer (0.1 M) was added
and cells were blocked with 0.1 M PBS in the presence
of 1% Triton X-100, 1.0 M glycine, and 5% normal
goat serum, and incubated in the sequence with antiBrdU and secondary anti-mouse HRP conjugated with
diaminobenzidine (DAB).

RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA isolated from cells was used E.Z.N.A.Â®
HP Total RNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Doraville, GA,
USA). The reverse transcription was performed with the
PrimeScriptÂ® RT reagent Kit (TakaRa, Shiga, Japan).
After mixing the resulting Complementary DNA template
with SET, or GAPDH primers, respectively and TaKaRa
SYBRÂ® Premix Ex Taqâ„¢, Quantitative Real-Time PCR
reaction was performed on a ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Wound healing scratch assay
Cells were grown as monolayers in triplicates in 12well plates (2 Ã— 105) until confluent. Cells were created an
artificial scratch wound, and cell debris was removed by
washing with PBS. Cell migration was photographed and
the width of the wound was measured.

Cell invasion assay

randomly divided into two groups (n = 9) and treated
intraperitoneally with DMSO, FTY720 (3 mg/ kg/day)
for 18 days. Tumor growth was analyzed by measuring
tumor length (L) and width (W) and calculating volume
(V) through the formula, V = LW2/2.

Cell invasion was evaluated by a Boyden chamber
assay. The polycarbonate filters (8 Î¼m pore size, Corning
Costar Corning Incorporated, NY, USA) were pre-coated
with Matrigel Matrix (BD Biosciences), and reconstituted
at 37 Â°C for 30 min to gel. Cells (1 Ã— 105) were suspended
in 150 Î¼l serum free RPMI 1640 and added into the upper
chamber, while 600 Î¼l of complete media was added to the
lower chamber. After 24 h of incubation, the cells migrated
through the matrigel and adhere onto the lower chamber
was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, stained
with Mayerâ€™s hematoxylin (Sigmaâ€“Aldrich) and counted
under upright microscope (five fields per chamber).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was undertaken with SPSS
16.0 software. The Ï‡2 test was used to examine
possible correlations between SET expression and
clinicopathologic factors. Unpaired two-tailed Studentâ€™s
t-test was used to determine the statistical relevance
between groups. Survival curves were plotted using
the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the logrank test. Receiver operating curve (ROC) was used to
determine the optimal cutoff point based on progression
end point for SET expression. P value of <0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical significance.

PP2A activity assay
PP2A immunoprecipitation phosphatase assay kit
(Upstate, Temecula, CA) was used to measure phosphate
release as an index of phosphatase activity according to
the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Briefly, 100 Î¼g protein
isolated from cells was incubated with 4 Î¼g anti-PP2A
monoclonal antibody (CST) overnight. 40 Î¼l of protein A
agarose beads were added and the mixture was incubated
at 4 Â°C for 2 h. Subsequently, the beads were collected and
washed three times with 700 Î¼l of ice-cold TBS and one
time with 500 Î¼l Ser/Thr Assay Buffer. The beads were
further incubated with 750 mM phosphopeptide in assay
buffer for 10 min at 30 Â°C with constant agitation. 100
Î¼l of Malachite Green Phosphate Detection Solution was
added and the absorbance at 650 nm was measured on a
microplate reader.
