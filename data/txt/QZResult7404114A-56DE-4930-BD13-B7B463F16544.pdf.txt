ABSTRACT
Partial loss of large ribosomal subunit protein 24 (RPL24) function is known to
protect mice against Akt or Myc-driven cancers, in part via translational inhibition
of a subset of cap(eIF4E)-dependently translated mRNAs. The role of RPL24 in
human malignancies is unknown. By analyzing a public dataset of matched human
breast cancers and normal mammary tissue, we found that breast cancers express
significantly more RPL24 than matched normal breast samples. Depletion of RPL24
in breast cancer cells by >70% reduced cell viability by 80% and decreased protein
expression of the eIF4E-dependently translated proteins cyclin D1 (75%), survivin
(46%) and NBS1 (30%) without altering GAPDH or beta-tubulin levels. RPL24
knockdown also reduced 80S subunit levels relative to 40S and 60S levels. These
effects on expression of eIF4E-dependent proteins and ribosome assembly were
mimicked by 2-24 h treatment with the pan-HDACi, trichostatin A (TSA), which
induced acetylation of 15 different polysome-associated proteins including RPL24.
Furthermore, HDAC6-selective inhibition or HDAC6 knockdown induced ribosomal
protein acetylation. Via mass spectrometry, we found that 60S-associated, but not,
polysome-associated, RPL24 undergoes HDACi-induced acetylation on K27. Thus,
RPL24 K27 acetylation may play a role in ribosome assembly. These findings point
toward a novel acetylation-dependent polysome assembly mechanism regulating
tumorigenesis.

INTRODUCTION

assembly and increase cap-dependent (eIF4E-dependent)
translation of tumorigenic mRNAs [1-4].
Recent studies indicate that other pathways, in
addition to the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, can cause
translational dysregulation in cancer. For example,
the rRNA methyltransferase WBSCR22 is involved
in the biogenesis of the 40S ribosomal subunit and is
overexpressed in invasive breast cancer [5]. The large
ribosomal subunit protein 24 (RPL24) is another translation
factor previously linked to tumorigenesis. Homozygous
RPL24 deficiency is lethal in mice. In contrast, RPL24

Control of protein synthesis is commonly
dysregulated in cancer, most frequently by mutational
activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, protein kinase
B/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR)
pathway. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway promotes cell
survival and growth, by inducing the phosphorylation
of the small (40S) ribosomal subunit protein S6 (RPS6)
and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4e binding protein 1
(4eBP1). These events stimulate polysome (polyribosome)

haploinsufficient mice are viable with specific eye,
skeletal, and coat pigment defects [6]. Interestingly, these
RPL24 haploinsufficient mice show greater survival
from Akt-induced lymphomagenesis. This protection is
associated with an overall decrease in thymocyte protein
synthesis [7]. Likewise, RPL24 haploinsufficient mice
are protected from Myc-driven tumorigenesis. This same
study demonstrated that Myc-induced tumorigenesis
arises by increased cap-dependent translation that is also
prevented by RPL24 haploinsufficiency [8]. In studies
of human lung adenocarcinoma cells depleted of RPL24
by RNA interference, and in RPL24 haploinsufficient
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), RPL24 reduction is
associated with increased p53 expression [9], suggesting
that the prevention of tumorigenesis by reduced RPL24
may also depend on a p53-dependent checkpoint
mechanism.
A full understanding of the role of RPL24 in
tumorigenesis requires mechanistic elucidation of how
RPL24 interacts with other ribosomal proteins and
translation factors. RPL24 is one of the later proteins to
be incorporated into the large ribosomal subunit, where it
then regulates the joining of the 60S subunit to the small
40S subunit [10-12]. Crystallography of the Tetrahymena
thermophilis 60S ribosomal subunit and cryo-electron
microscopy reconstruction of the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae 60S indicate that RPL24 resides on a surface of
the 60S ribosomal subunit close to where the eukaryotic
initiation factor 6 (eIF6) contacts the 60S [13-15]. The
anti-assembly factor, eIF6, binds to the pre-60S ribosomal
subunit and prevents premature association of 60S with the
40S subunit. Following 60S maturation, eIF6 is released,
allowing for the joining of the 40S sand 60S subunits to
form the 80S ribosome and further assembly of polysomes
[16-20].

Given the known role of RPL24 in murine
tumorigenesis and therapeutic interest in eIF4E-driven
human breast cancers [21], we asked if RPL24 expression
is also altered during human breast tumorigenesis, and
observed that most human breast cancers overexpress
RPL24 relative to normal breast tissue. We then
demonstrated that RPL24 depletion in breast cancer
cells reduces their growth and viability in association
with selectively impaired expression of cap-dependent
proteins needed for survival and proliferation, while
also inhibiting 80S ribosome and polysome assembly by
preventing eIF6 release from the 60S subunit. We also
showed that 2-24 h treatment with a pan-inhibitor of
class I and II histone deacetylases, trichostatin-A (TSA),
mimics the above effects of RPL24 depletion, inducing
60S subunit-associated acetylation of RPL24 at K27. TSA
also induced acetylation of polysomal RPL24 at K93 and
14 other ribosomal proteins. Comparison of pan-, class-,
and isotype-selective HDACi’s suggested that HDAC6
controls total acetylation levels of ribosomal proteins, a
conclusion supported by HDAC6 knockdown studies.

RESULTS
RPL24 expression is transcriptionally upregulated
during human breast tumorigenesis
Since RPL24 haploinsufficiency impairs the
formation of both Akt-driven and Myc-driven murine
malignancies [7-9], we looked for evidence that RPL24
upregulation may contribute to human tumorigenesis as
well. To that end, we compared microarrayed samples
of human cancers paired with their normal organ tissue

levels were analyzed from the dataset presented in [22]. (a) Box plot of RPL24 expression levels in patient-matched breast carcinoma and

samples. Using a public dataset of RNA profiles reported
from 43 pairs of breast cancer and normal breast samples
[32], we determined that approximately two-thirds of the
breast cancers showed increased RPL24 transcript levels
relative to their matched normal breast sample (Figure 1a).
The entire group of tumor samples exhibited a significant
20% mean overall increase in RPL24 expression levels
(p = 0.001), indicating that transcriptional upregulation of
RPL24 commonly occurs in human breast tumorigenesis
(Figure 1b).

to decrease RPL24 protein expression by approximately
70% (Figure 2a). This resulted in a 5-fold (80%) reduction
in SKBR3 cell viability measured after 4 days in culture
(Figure 2b). Associated with RPL24 depletion and growth
inhibition was a marked reduction in the expression
of three different eIF4E-regulated and cap-dependent
transcripts necessary for cell proliferation (75% reduction
in cyclin D1), survival (46% reduction in survivin), and
DNA repair and integrity (30% reduction in NBS1).
Protein levels of two housekeeping genes not regulated
by eIF4E [21, 33-35], GAPDH and β-tubulin, were not
affected by RPL24 depletion (Figure 2a).

viability while inhibiting cap (eIF4eE)-dependent
expression of proliferation, survival and genome
stability proteins

RPL24 knockdown reduces 80S and polysome
assembly while increasing 60S retention of eIF6
Since RPL24 depletion decreased the levels of
three cap-dependently translated proteins, we next
evaluated the impact of RPL24 knockdown on overall
ribosome and polysome formation in these cells. We
used polysome profiling, which utilizes continuous
sucrose gradient fractionation to separate free 40S and
60S ribosomal subunits, 80S ribosomes, and polysomes
(two or more ribosomes on one mRNA). The ratio of both
80S ribosomes and polysome peaks relative to free 40S
and 60S ribosomal subunits was significantly reduced

Studies of RPL24 haploinsufficient mice protected
from Myc-driven tumorigenesis revealed that dysregulated
cap-dependent protein synthesis not only induces tumor
formation but also results in cell cycle dysregulation and
genomic instability [8]. Since the translation-dependent
checkpoint mechanism remains undefined, we evaluated
the impact of RPL24 depletion in a model human breast
cancer cell line, SKBR3, sensitive to eIF4E-regulated and
cap-dependent translation inhibition [33]. Two different
RPL24-directed shRNA-expressing lentiviruses were used

taken in parallel for western blots. (a) Western blots were performed on lysates from an equal number of cells using antibodies toward the

Ribosomal protein acetylation is induced by panHDACi and HDAC6-selective inhibitors

in SKBR3 cells following efficient RPL24 knockdown
(Figure 3a,b). This observed increase in 40S and 60S
subunits relative to 80S ribosomes implies a defect in
40S-60S joining induced by the RPL24 knockdown.
Since eIF6 bound to the pre-60S subunit prevents
joining of the 40S and 60S subunits [16-20] and occurs
adjacent to RPL24 on 60S [13] (Figure 3c), we performed
immunoblotting on all 60S-containing polysome fractions
to evaluate the impact of RPL24 knockdown on eIF6
retention. Probing fractions corresponding to the area
of the polysome profile near the 60S peak for Rack1, an
obligatory 40S component, and RPL4, an obligatory 60S
component, confirmed that these fractions do, in fact,
encompass the 60 subunit. As expected, RPL24 levels
were drastically decreased in SKBR3 cells expressing
RPL24 shRNA. Associated with RPL24 knockdown was
a striking increase in 60S-associated eIF6 (Figure 3d). To
rule out the possibility that the observed 60S retention of
eIF6 might be a false-positive or non-specific artifact of
lentiviral expressed RPL24 shRNA, we overexpressed a
functionally deficient truncation mutant of RPL24 that
eliminates the last 17 amino acids. Polysome profiling
of 293T cells expressing intact versus truncated RPL24
protein confirmed that truncated RPL24 can induce 60S
retention of eIF6 (Figure S1).

Previous studies have shown that pan-inhibitors
of class I and II histone deacetylases (pan-HDACi), like
TSA, can rapidly destabilize a number of oncogenic
transcripts including HER2 in a cycloheximide-dependent
manner (Figure S2, [25, 36]). Since cycloheximide
inhibits polysome formation, these results suggested that
polysomes are possibly involved in HER2 mRNA decay.
Thus, SKBR3 cells were treated with TSA to evaluate
polysome protein acetylation and determine if, similar to
RPL24 depletion, HDACi can affect ribosome assembly
dynamics. To detect early (2 h) ribosome or polysome
acetylation following HDACi treatment (1 µM TSA),
SKBR3 polysomes were isolated using a discontinuous
sucrose gradient as previously described [28]. Western
blots using an antibody against acetylated lysine
residues showed several TSA-induced bands, including
a prominent TSA-induced acetyl-lysine protein band comigrating with RPL24 (Figure 4a, indicated by arrow),
while total RPL24 levels were not altered by TSA. Mass
spectrometry studies indicate that 15 ribosomal proteins,
11 large subunit proteins (RPL24 included) and 4 small
subunit proteins, underwent at least a two-fold induction
in acetylation following 2h or 6h TSA treatment (1 µM)
(Figure 4b, Figure S3a-q).
Like TSA, the HDAC6 (class IIb)-selective

cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing a GFP control or RPL24-targeting shRNA for three days. (a) Western blots using the

gradient (10-50%) and ultracentrifugation followed by fractionation was performed to separate ribosomal subunits and polysomes. (c)

subunit in complex with eIF6 [13]. (d) Western blots using the indicated antibodies were performed on fractions from the 60S peaks using

inhibitors, Tubacin and ACY-775, as well as HDAC6
siRNA, all induce tubulin acetylation as expected as
well as ribosomal protein acetylation, including the band
that co-migrates with RPL24 (Figure 4c,d, indicated by
arrows). Although the class I-specific HDACi, Entinostat,
induces histone H2B acetylation without acetylating
tubulin, it does not alter ribosomal protein acetylation
even at a dose of 20 µM (Figure 4c). Thus, the tubulinacetylating effects of pan-HDACi, known to be mediated
by inhibition or knockdown of HDAC6, correspond to
the observed ribosome and RPL24 acetylation responses

induced by TSA.

Like RPL24 knockdown, HDACi reduces 80S
assembly while increasing 60S retention of
eIF6 and reduces expression of cap (eIF4E)dependently translated proteins
Using continuous sucrose gradient fractionation
of SKBR3 polysomes, 2 h culture treatment with TSA
reduced 80S and polysome assembly (Figure 5a) while

extracts. (b) Mass spectrometry was performed on ribopellets as described in materials and methods and in Figure 6. The fold change in

increasing 60S retention of eIF6 without reducing 60S
RPL24 levels (Figure 5b). This result is comparable
to that produced by RPL24 knockdown (Figure 3) or
truncation (Figure S1). Furthermore, similar to RPL24

knockdown, 24 h TSA treatment reduced the expression
of the cap(eIF4e)-dependently translated proteins cyclin
D1, survivin, and NBS1 relative to the housekeeping
proteins GAPDH and β-tubulin (Figure 5c). Shorter (8 h)
TSA treatment reduced cyclin D1 levels but not survivin
or NBS1 levels. The more rapid reduction of cyclin D1
levels was likely caused by the known effects of TSA on
cyclin D1 transcription and transcript stability in addition
to its effects on translation [37].

HDACi enhances lysine (K27) acetylation on 60S
RPL24
Mass spectrometry studies were performed to
identify sites of lysine (K) acetylation within RPL24
induced by HDACi. Continuous and discontinuous
sucrose gradient fractionations were performed to
isolate 60S subunits and total polysomes respectively.
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was then performed on
60S and polysome samples and RPL24-containing bands
were excised, trypsin digested, and subjected to mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Figure 6a). Among several
detected acetylated RPL24 peptides, two were increased
by TSA treatment; TDGKacVFQFLNAK (acetyl-K27)
and AITGASLADIM*AKacR (acetyl-K93), where the
internal lysines in both peptides are N-acetylated (Kac). As
the MS experiments of the 60S polysome were performed
after in-gel digestion the methionine residue of the second
peptide was predominantly oxidized (M*=M+16), as
commonly observed during SDS PAGE processing.
In independent, in-solution digestion experiments, we
also identified the corresponding non-oxidized form
of acetylated peptide AITGASLADIMAKacR with
correlating MS/MS fragmentation pattern. Representative
spectra are shown for TDGKac VFQFLNAK (acetyl-K27)
and AITGASLADIM*AKacR (acetyl-K93)) (Figure
S4a,b). In 3 biological replicate experiments, the amount
of K27-acetylated RPL24, normalized to total protein
concentration within the 60S subunit, was increased at
least 2-fold within 2 h of TSA treatment. However, there
was no significant induction of RPL24 K27 acetylation
found within polysomes (not containing 60S subunits)
(Figure 6b). In contrast, RPL24 K93 acetylation within
the 60S subunits was not significantly changed by TSA
treatment, yet K93 acetylation was induced 2.5-fold within
RPL24 associated with polysomes (Figure 6c). Given the
proximity of the T. thermophilia RPL24 K26 site (that
resides in a homologous region to human K27) to eIF6
(Figure 7a), these findings implicate involvement of the
TSA induced acetylation of RPL24 at K27 in preventing
40S-60S subunit joining and 60S retention of eIF6.

DISCUSSION
Consistent with the role of RPL24 in protecting

Oncotarget

against Akt-driven and Myc-driven murine tumorigenesis
[7, 8], the present study provides new evidence that, not
only is elevated RPL24 expression common in human
breast tumors, but depletion or structural alteration of
RPL24 can significantly impair human breast cancer
cell viability (Figure 1,2). Our results indicate that
this could occur through a reduction in cap(eIF4E)dependent translation of proteins essential for cancer cell
proliferation (e.g. cyclin D1), survival (e.g. survivin) and
genome repair (e.g. NBS1) (Figure 2). Our findings also
indicate that the mechanism of action by which RPL24
deficiency reduces expression of these proteins essential

for cancer cell viability involves failure of 40S and 60S
ribosomal subunit joining into functional 80S ribosomes
by retention of eIF6 on 60S subunits (Figure 3).
Although RPL24 is an essential ribosomal protein,
partial (up to 70%) depletion of RPL24 does not reduce
the expression of all proteins but preferentially inhibits
expression of eIF4E-regulated and cap-dependently
translated proteins. In particular, the translation of
housekeeping genes like GAPDH and β-tubulin remained
unaffected when assessed by protein levels normalized
to total cell number (Figure 2). In contrast, cyclin D1,
survivin, and NBS1 are among several well-known
growth, survival and tumorigenic transcripts with highly
structured 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs) whose capdependent ribosomal translation is tightly regulated by
eIF4E; and their synthesis was reduced by as much as 75%
following partial depletion of RPL24. These results raise
the possibility that RPL24 depletion changes ribosome
structure or recruitment factors in a manner that causes
ribosomes to be recruited to cap-dependently translated
mRNAs less efficiently.
As demonstrated in this study and schematically
illustrated in Figure 7b, treatment of breast cancer cells
with a pan-HDACi like TSA induces recruitment of eIF6

mass-spectrometry-based techniques to analyze ribosomal
protein acetylation. SKBR3 cells were treated with TSA (1
μM, 2 h or 6 h). To isolate 60S subunits, polysome profiles
were performed and 60S fractions were TCA precipitated.
Concentrated 60S samples were resolved on 4-12% bis-tris gels
and RPL24-containing bands were excised and trypsin digested.
In parallel, polysomes were isolated using a discontinuous
sucrose gradient as described. Trypsin digestions and acetyl
lysine immunoprecipitations were subsequently carried out.
Mass spectrometry was performed on 60S-associated RPL24containing gel bands or polysome-containing acetyl-lysine
immunoprecipitations as described in the methods section.  (b,c)

of RPL24 K93 is also shown in Figure 4b.

(b) eIF6 binds to the pre-60S near RPL24 to prevent premature
association of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits; eIF6 is then
released from the mature 60S, allowing it to join with the 40S to
form the 80S ribosome. Our model indicates that either RPL24
depletion or TSA (HDACi)-induced RPL24 acetylation on K27
prevents eIF6 release and 80S formation.

to 60S subunits along with acetylation of RPL24 at K27,
likely impairing 40S-60S joining. These phenotypes
mimic RPL24 knockdown (Figure 3, Figure 5).
Consistent with this finding, the crystal structure of the T.
thermophilia 60S subunit [13] reveals that RPL24 K26,
which closely aligns with human RPL24 K27, is adjacent
to eIF6 (Figure 3c, 7a). While we detected multiple sites
of acetylation on RPL24, only K27 acetylation was
induced by HDACi in association with the 60S subunit.
Similar to RPL24 depletion, 24 h of HDACi treatment
reduced the expression of cyclin D1, survivin, and
NBS1 relative to GAPDH and β-tubulin (Figure 5c), a
possible secondary consequence of the 60S acetylation
and ribosome assembly failure noted as early as 2 h after
TSA treatment. These timing differences in responses to
the same TSA treatment suggest that although ribosome
assembly is inhibited rapidly, it takes hours for the effects
of such a functional impairment in ribosome assembly to
manifest as a significant reduction in the pools of proteins
synthesized by cap-dependent translation.
Our findings point toward the existence of an as
yet unrecognized endogenous and acetylation-dependent
mechanism that regulates both polysome assembly and
cap-dependent protein translation. Including RPL24,
we identified fifteen ribosomal proteins that undergo
acetylation induction two-fold or more as a rapid
consequence of HDACi treatment. These proteins are
also potential contributors to this acetylation-dependent
control of ribosome assembly. Like pan-HDACi treatment,
enzymatic inhibition or knockdown of cytoplasmic
HDAC6 appears to be sufficient to induce polysomal
protein acetylation, in contrast to a class I-selective
HDACi like Entinostat which has no such affect (Figure
4). Since only 2-6 h treatment with an HDAC6-selective
inhibitor induces near maximum levels of ribosome
protein acetylation, this posttranslational structural change
is likely due to a direct cytoplasmic HDAC effect on
ribosomal proteins rather than any indirect effect mediated
by HDAC regulated nuclear gene expression.
In view of the current lack of any drug-like agent
that can specifically target RPL24, our study also points
toward RPL24 as a previously unrecognized subcellular
target potentially contributing to the known anticancer
activity of two approved cancer therapeutics, vorinostat
and romidepsin, that are HDACi’s like TSA, not to
mention contributing to the anticancer mechanisms of
investigational HDAC6-selective inhibitors like ACY-775.
The fact that homozygous loss of RPL24 is embryonic
lethal [6] might cause concern about developing a targetspecific anti-RPL24 cancer therapeutic. However, it is
important to recall that the homozygous deletion of many
well-established breast cancer drug targets, such as human
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), mTOR, and
the catalytic domain of PI3K, are also embryonic lethal
[38-41], yet this fact did not preclude or even delay the
successful clinical development of therapeutics selective
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for these targets. The fact that RPL24 haploinsufficiency
is compatible with normal murine lifespan is additionally
reassuring from the standpoint of developing an antiRPL24 therapeutic, and points to the established fact that
all approved anticancer agents rely on in vivo definition
of an optimal therapeutic window, whereby anticancer
efficacy vastly exceeds host toxicity. Given that RPL24
haploinsufficiency protects mice from Akt- and Mycdriven tumorigenesis [7, 8], it is interesting to note that
at least 40% of basal-like breast cancers overexpress Akt
or Myc [42], indicating that anti-RPL24 therapeutics
could be effective against basal-like and other clinically
aggressive subsets of human breast cancer.

METHODS
Analysis of RPL24 expression in patient-matched
breast carcinoma and normal breast tissue
Expression data from 43 patient-matched breast
carcinoma and normal breast tissue samples assayed on
Affymetrix U133A microarrays (GSE15852) was obtained
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [22]. Raw
data was RMA-normalized, annotated using its associated
platform annotation file (GPL96-39578) and meancentered. Expression levels of the RPL24 probe within the
patient-matched tumor and normal samples were obtained
and compared. Significance was assessed using the paired
t-test.

SKBR3 human breast cancer cells (American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD) were grown
in McCoy’s 5A media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and L-glutamate. 293T cells (American Type

virus was collected for two days and concentrated it as
outlined previously [26, 27]. SKBR3 cells were infected
in the presence of 6 µg/ml polybrene with a multiplicity
of infection of ~2. One day after infection media was
changed to regular growth media in the case of transient
infections or growth media with 0.5 µg/ml puromycin in
the case of stable transfections.

MO)). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ
software.

Isolation of ribosomes
Cells, plated at ~90% confluency, were treated as
indicated. After treatment, cells were treated with 50 µg/
ml cycloheximide for 15 minutes. Cells were lysed with
a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 75 mM
NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.35% NP40, pH 7.9 supplemented
with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets,
PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor tablets (Roche) per
manufacturer’s instructions, 50 µg/ml cycloheximide,
SUPERase RNase inhibitors (Life Technologies) per
manufacturer’s instructions, 15 µM TSA, and 5 mM
nicotinimide to inhibit HDACs. Supernatants were
collected as cytoplasmic preparations. Where indicated,
pellets containing nuclei were resuspended in RIPA buffer
(described above). The suspension was spun at 13,000
rpm for 5 min and supernatants were collected as nuclear
preparations.
Ribosomes were subsequently isolated from
cytoplasmic preparations as described previously [28].
Briefly, lysates were layered on top of a 12% and 33%
discontinuous sucrose gradient and spun at 38,000 rpm for
2 h. The resulting polysome pellet was then resuspended,
stripped of RNA with acetic acid, and then pelleted with
acetone. The pellet was then resuspended in 8 M urea, 2%
CHAPS, and 25 mM dithiothreitol (DTT).
Polysome profiles to separate the 40S, 60S, 80S and
polysomes were carried out by layering cell lysates over
a continuous 10-50% sucrose gradient and spun at 38,000
rpm for 2 h as previously described [29, 30]. Fractions
were collected using a Retriever 500 fraction collector
with a UV (UA6) detector (ISCO Teledyne (Lincoln,
Nebraska)).

siRNA transfection
The following siRNAs were purchased from
(Thermo Scientific-Dharmacon, Chicago, IL): HDAC6targeting smart pool (L-003499-00) and non-targeting
control pool (D-001810-10-05). Lipofectamine 2000
(Life Technologies) was used to transfect SKBR3 cells
per manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were analyzed 72 hours
after transfection.

Viability assay
Cells infected with different shRNA-expressing
lentiviruses were plated in 96-well plates at a density of
5,000 cells per well. Three hours after plating (T0), a base
line viability reading was taken using the CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, Madison,
WI). Four days later (T4) another reading was taken
using the same assay. For each treatment, each of three
T4 data points was divided by the average of all three T0
data points for that treatment. The data from the RPL24
shRNA-treated cells was then normalized to that from the
control cells. Data is represented by the mean and standard
deviation of triplicates.

(pH 8.0), 1mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% triton X-100,
0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 140 mM NaCl, 20
mM NaF, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets
(Roche Diagnostics Corp., Basel, Switzerland) and the
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail PhosSTOP (Roche)), the
latter two as indicated by the manufacturer’s protocol.
Equal amounts of protein were diluted in 2X sample
buffer. Immunoblots on PVDF (Polyvinyldene Fluoride)
membranes were blocked with nonfat milk in tris-buffered
saline with 0.05% tween-20 (TBST). The following
antibodies were incubated with membranes in 5% nonfat
milk in TBST: RPL24 (Proteintech, Chicago, IL), Cyclin

CONCLUSIONS

Mass spectrometry

This is the first study implicating a role for RPL24
expression in human breast tumors and in regulating
protein translation necessary for breast tumorigenesis.
We demonstrate that RPL24 depletion decreases the level
of proteins synthesized by cap-dependent translation
essential for cancer cell growth, survival and genome
repair, without altering the synthesis of housekeeping
proteins. Polysome profiling indicates that this partial
translation defect might be related to the control of eIF6
release from the 60S subunit, inhibiting assembly of 80S
ribosomes and polysomes. Furthermore, we show that
HDACi and more specifically, inhibition of HDAC6,
rapidly induces acetylation of multiple ribosomal proteins,
and that RPL24 acetylation at K27 is associated with
impairment in ribosome assembly similarly induced by
RPL24 depletion. Therefore, our findings point toward
the existence of an endogenous, HDAC6- and protein
deacetylation-dependent polysome assembly mechanism
that can regulate oncogenic growth and potentially serve
as a novel cancer therapeutic target.

To prepare polysome samples for mass spectrometry,
cells were treated with HDACi and polysome pellets
were prepared using a discontinuous sucrose gradient as
described above. Protein concentration was determined
using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo
Scientific) and equal amount of protein were trypsin
digested. Acetyl-lysine immunoprecipitations were carried
on resultant peptides out using an antibody from Cell
Signaling Technology. Acetyl-proteins were then eluted,
extracted, and desalted.
To determine the acetylation status of 60S subunit
proteins, cells were treated with HDACi and polysome
profiles were performed as described above. The four
fractions representing the 60S subunit were identified,
via western blots, for the absence of Rack1 (40S marker)
and the presence of RPL24 (60S marker). Those 60S
fractions were then TSA precipitated and reconstituted in
2% SDS. 60S samples (normalized by protein loading)
were resolved using 4-12% Bis-Tris gels and stained with
Imperial Protein Stain (Thermo). Gel bands were excised,
diced into small pieces, destained, reduced with 10 mM
dithiothreitol, and alkylated with 5 mM iodoacetamide. Ingel trypsin digestion was performed using a 1:20 enzyme
to protein ratio for 16 h at 37oC. Resultant peptides were
extracted and desalted.
Three biological replicates of polysome or 60S
samples were then analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a
quadrupole time-of-flight (QqTOF)TripleTOF 5600 mass
spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Dublin, CA) coupled to an
Eksigent (Dublin, CA) nanoLC Ultra, 2D plus. Briefly,
the resulting peptides were chromatographically separated
on a C-18 reversed-phase analytical column (75 µm
I.D.) connected to the TripleTOF 5600 operating in data
dependent mode (1 MS1 survey scan followed by 30 MS/
MS scans per 1.8 second acquisition cycle) [31]. Mascot
v2.3.02 and ProteinPilot v4.5 data base searches were
employed for peptide identification (Table S1, Table S2)
using a false discovery rate analysis (FDR) of 0.01. For
MS/MS spectral data of acetylated peptides see Figures
S3 and S4. Moreover, more detailed interactive viewing
of spectral libraries is available at the Panorama webserver
(University of Washington, Seattle), at ‘https://daily.
panoramaweb.org/labkey/project/Gibson/Polysomes_
Benz2/begin.view?’.
Quantitative data analysis of acetyl-lysine peptides
was performed by integration of selected molecular ion
intensities using Skyline MS1 Filtering as previously
described [31]. The average signal intensity, as
determined by the area under the curve (AUC) of the LC
chromatogram, of the replicate biological samples was
calculated. The amount of acetylated peptide normalized
to total protein loaded onto the gel for each condition was
determined and the fold induction upon TSA treatment
was then calculated.
