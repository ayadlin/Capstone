Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

ORCTL3 is a member of a group of genes, the so-called anticancer genes, that cause tumourspecific cell death. We show that this activity is triggered in isogenic renal cells upon their
transformation independently of the cells’ proliferation status. For its cell death effect ORCTL3
targets the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) in fatty acid metabolism. This is caused by
transmembrane domains 3 and 4, which are more efficacious in vitro than a low molecular weight
drug against SCD1, and critically depend on their expression level. SCD1 is found upregulated
upon renal cell transformation indicating that its activity, while not impacting proliferation,
represents a critical bottleneck for tumourigenesis. An adenovirus expressing ORCTL3 leads to
growth inhibition of renal tumours in vivo and to substantial destruction of patients’ kidney
tumour cells ex vivo. Our results indicate fatty acid metabolism as a target for tumour-specific
apoptosis in renal tumours and suggest ORCTL3 as a means to accomplish this.

INTRODUCTION

Recent studies have led to the emergence of a new class of genes with a specific anti-cancer
activity. Upon ectopic expression these factors cause the specific destruction of tumour cells
by various forms of cell death such as apoptosis, autophagy, or mitotic catastrophe, while
normal cells are spared. Among those genes are apoptin, mda-7/IL-24, par-4, and also
TRAIL.1-5 Some of the factors are in clinical trials and show promising results.6 Their
modes of action are currently under intense investigation fuelled by the expectation that they
reveal novel therapeutic interference options. We have recently presented ORCTL3 as one of
the members of this growing, functionally defined gene family that we collectively named
“anticancer genes”.6 ORCTL3 was isolated in a systematic screen for such genes and its
transfection into numerous tumourigenic cells induced apoptosis, while normal and primary
cells remained healthy.7 How this is accomplished remained unknown.
Recently, the metabolism of tumour cells has intensely been studied for differences to
normal cells with the expectation that this will lead to novel targets and treatment options.8,9
Several studies indicated that fatty acid metabolism is changed in malignant cells, which is
mainly interpreted as a consequence of the increased requirement of lipids for their
excessive proliferation.10 Indeed, most conventional anticancer compounds target actively
proliferating cells and their efficiency, as well as their side effects, are correlated with
enhanced proliferation. However, many tumour cells, in particular cancer stem cells, do not
feature changes in their proliferation rate. Hence, the usefulness of targeting fatty acid
metabolism for tumour treatment is currently unknown.

Renal cancer is the fourteenth most common cancer worldwide, with an estimated 273,500
new cases diagnosed in 2008. So far the therapy of renal tumours relies mainly on surgery
and there is hardly any systemic drug treatment that can be used against advanced renal
tumours.11 The majority of tumors eventually become refractory even to novel targeted
therapies.12 The survival rate is only around 50% within the first five years after diagnosis.
Hence, there is an urgent need to discover novel treatment options.
Here we show that ORCTL3 is activated for apoptosis induction when renal cells become
transformed, independently of the proliferation status of the cells. For its apoptosis effect
ORCTL3 targets stearoyl-CoA desaturase, an enzyme that introduces a double bond in the
fatty acid stearic acid. We have found that ORCTL3 exerts its tumour-specific effect on
renal cancer cells in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo.

RESULTS
ORCTL3 is activated for apoptosis induction by transformation
We chose an isogenic system of transformed versus normal renal cells in order to implement
the most stringent test for ORCTL3’s tumour specificity. To focus on a proven
transformation system we turned to the primate renal CV-1 cells, which have extensively
been used in the past and become transformed by individual tumourigenic mutations.13 The
sequencing of kidney cancer genomes has revealed considerable genetic inter- and intratumour heterogeneity of renal tumours.14,15 Because of this we asked whether ORCTL3 can

target changes emerging from renal cell transformation per se rather than changes based on
specific mutations found in subpopulations of renal tumours. We transfected these cells with
myc, an activated allele of H-ras, and also with a mutant allele of p53, which establish cell
transformation by various signalling pathways and have previously been connected with at
least some human kidney cancers.16-18 We also transfected the viral oncogenes E6 and E1A
that have long been used for a partial transformation of cells.19 In order not to introduce a
bias by picking individual colonies, we used pools of transfected cells with a range of
expression levels of the transfected genes to more accurately recapitulate the genetic
heterogeneity in tumours.20 These mutations caused morphological changes, ranging from
profound, especially for H-ras and myc, which lost their contact inhibition, to more subtle
changes such as for E1A, which mostly resembled their wild type (WT) CV-1 counterparts
(Supplementary Figure S1a,b). Nevertheless, all tumourigenic mutations led to the
immortalisation of the cells, while the parental CV-1 cells cease proliferation after about 10
passages. Transfection of WT CV-1 cells with a number of known pro-apoptotic genes such
as RIP1, caspase-8, ANT1, and caspase-2 caused efficient cell death confirming the integrity
of apoptosis signalling pathways in these cells (Supplementary Figure S1c, S2). The
transformed as well as the WT CV-1 cells were then transfected with an expression
construct for ORCTL3 and caspase-2 as a positive control. In parallel a fusion construct of
ORCTL3 with an ER retention signal (ORCTL3-ER) was introduced that was found to
generate higher apoptosis levels.7 In the WT CV-1 cells we detected no appreciable
apoptosis with both ORCTL3 constructs (Figure 1a), while caspase-2 was an efficient
apoptosis inducer indicating, as before (Supplementary Figure S1c, S2), the intact apoptosis
sensitivity of these cells. In contrast, when ORCTL3 was transfected into the transformed
CV-1 cells we observed significant apoptosis induction with all cells harbouring
tumourigenic mutations, except the E1A transfected cells, which correlated with their minor
transformed phenotype (Figure 1b-f and Supplementary Figure S1a). No further increase of
apoptosis induction was observed with the ORCTL3-ER construct. In some of the
transformed cells such as those transfected by H-ras the general apoptosis inducer caspase-2
was less efficient, in agreement with reports that attribute an apoptosis-inhibiting activity to
this oncogene.21 The lack of apoptosis induction in the WT CV-1 cells was not due to a
lower expression level of ORCTL3 in those cells. Rather, we detected a considerably higher
transfection efficiency and consequently a higher expression of ORCTL3 in WT CV-1 cells
than in their transformed counterparts (Figure 1g,h).
We compared ORCTL3 with the other anticancer genes apoptin, par-4, and mda-7/IL-24.
Like ORCTL3, they remained ineffective for apoptosis induction in parental CV-1 cells
(Supplementary Figure S3a-f). Par-4 became an apoptosis inducer in all CV-1 cell variants
with tumourigenic mutations, as was the case for apoptin with the exception of p53-mut
transformed cells and for IL-24/mad-7 with the exception of E6 and myc transformed cells.
Just like ORCTL3, all three anticancer genes remained inactive in E1A transformed cells. A
similar trend with higher absolute apoptosis values was observed when high amounts of the
recombinant TRAIL ligand were exogenously added to the cells (Supplementary Figure
S3g).

As a first step to determine the cell characteristics that underlie ORCTL3’s specificity we
assessed the proliferation status of WT and transformed CV-1 cells and found that in an
MTT assay only myc-transformed cells seemed to replicate slightly faster than WT CV-1
cells. All other tumourigenic mutations caused a slower proliferation (Figure 2a). Cell cycle
analysis revealed that cells with tumourigenic mutations, with the exception of E1A, had a
reduced population of cells in the G1 phase and an increase in subG1 cells indicating that
some of them underwent spontaneous apoptosis (Figure 2b).
ORCTL3 causes ARCosome activation and an incomplete ER stress response

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We recently characterised the ARCosome, a caspase-8-activation complex that physically
connects the ER with mitochondria and consists of mitochondrial Fis1 and Bap31 at the
ER.22 Upon recruitment of caspase-8 to the ARCosome Bap31 is cleaved and activates
downstream signals for apoptosis. ORCTL3 induces its apoptosis signal from the ER7 and
the physical proximity of the ARCosome to ORCTL3 led us to test the involvement of this
apoptosis sensor. Co-transfection of ORCTL3 led to the cleavage of a fusion protein of
Bap31-EYFP after 18 hours (50%), a time point at which no overt apoptosis could be
observed (Figure 3a,b and Supplementary Figure S4a) suggesting that it is an early event of
the apoptosis signalling by ORCTL3. In agreement with this, when we individually
inactivated the three components of the ARCosome, we observed a reduction of apoptosis
induced by ORCTL3 (Figure 3c,d). Moreover, ORCTL3 could interact with Bap31 in a coimmunoprecipitation experiment (Supplementary Figure S4b). However, transfection of the
ARCosome activator Fis1 elicited cell death in WT CV-1 cells indicating that this complex
is not exerting the tumour-specific effect. We previously observed an accumulation of the
ER stress sensor ATF4 but not of BiP/Grp78 as a signature of ORCTL3-transfected tumour
cells.7 We extended these results and also did not detect the upregulation of the proapototic
transcription factor CHOP, a ATF4 target gene in the canonical ER stress response (Figure
3e), while ATF3 was found to accumulate upon ORCTL3 expression (Supplementary Figure
S4c). The same ER stress response was observed when we assessed Bap31, ATF4, ATF3,
and BiP in H-ras transformed CV1 cells. Normal CV1 cells, on the other hand, showed a
much reduced Bap31 cleavage and no increase of the other ER stress markers
(Supplementary Figure S4d). Nevertheless, in Hela cells the mRNA of XBP-1 was spliced
upon ORCTL3 expression, a signal more proximal to the chaperone BiP (Figure 3f). The
knock-down of ATF4 led to a weak but significant reduction of ORCTL3 apoptosis (Figure
3g). These results indicate that some, but not all, consequences of canonical ER stress are
instigated by ORCTL3 expression.
ORCTL3 targets stearoyl-CoA desaturase for tumour-specific apoptosis induction
Downregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) has recently been revealed to cause
apoptosis in lung and colon tumour cells lines,23 which is mediated by a cellular response
that, like ORCTL3, leads to an incomplete ER stress response with ATF4 upregulation but
not BiP.24 Because of this and since both the SCD and ORCTL3 proteins are localised to the
ER membrane, we tested whether this enzyme is a target of ORCTL3 for apoptosis
induction. We added BSA-complexed oleic acid, the enzymatic product of SCD, to the cells
after they were transfected with ORCTL3 or caspase-2 as a control. ORCTL3-induced
apoptosis in p53- and H-ras-transformed CV-1 cells was significantly reduced, while cell

death caused by the upregulation of caspase-2, Bax, and caspase-8 remained unaffected
(Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure S5a,b). The transformed Hela and 293T cell lines also
showed a reduced apoptosis by ORCTL3 upon addition of oleic acid (Supplementary Figure
S5c). We observed an increase of p53- and H-ras-transformed cells undergoing apoptosis
over their normal WT CV-1 counterparts when an inhibitor of SCD1 (CAY10566) was
applied (Figure 4b). The application of this SCD1 inhibitor also caused Bap31 cleavage in
the H-ras transformed CV1 cells but not in the normal CV1 cells (Supplementary Figure 5d).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation revealed an interaction between ORCTL3 and SCD as
we could detect endogenous SCD1 by western blot when we immunoprecipitated
overexpressed ORCTL3. Conversely, when the endogenous SCD1 was immunoprecipitated,
we detected the overexpressed ORCTL3 as a discrete band, rather than a smear as detected
in the input probably representing differentially glycosylated forms of the ORCTL3
transporter (Figure 4c). Moreover, the expression of both mouse and human ORCTL3
reduced the desaturation index (18:1n-9/18:0 ratio) in normal and transformed CV1 cells,
with the mouse gene being slightly more effective (Figure 4d). The reduction of the
desaturation index in H-ras transformed CV1 cells was not a consequence of apoptosis
induction as the pro-apopotic p20 Bap31 fragment did not lead to a significant change in the
desaturation index. We also measured the fatty acid composition in normal and H-rad
transformed CV-1 cells (Supplementary Figure S5e). Co-transfection of SCD1 reduced
ORCTL3’s apoptosis induction but not cell death by RIP, ANT1, p20 and par-4 expression
(Figure 4e and Supplementary Figure S5f,g). We also observed the co-localisation of
transfected mouse and human ORCTL3 with endogenous SCD1 (Supplementary figure S6).
These results indicated that SCD activity is required for the survival of transformed, but not
WT CV-1 cells. In agreement with this, we found that the transformed CV-1 cells harbour
an upregulated SCD1 compared with normal cells (Figure 4f). We also tested the expression
level of SCD5 and found a pronounced upregulation of this enzyme in H-ras transformed
CV1 cells (Supplementary Figure S7a). Moreover, we detected an interaction between
mouse and ORCTL3 with SCD5 (Supplementary Figure 7b).
ORCTL3’s apoptosis induction is specific for the mouse gene and critically depends on
transmembrane domains 3 and 4
The mouse ORCTL3 gene and its human homologue are 73% identical at the protein level
(84% similarity). Surprisingly, when we transfected human ORCTL3, we did not detect
appreciable apoptosis induction in transformed HeLa and 293T cells (Figure 5a). Even
titration experiments revealed that the degree of cell death attainable with human ORCTL3
remained significantly below the mouse ORCTL3 (Supplementary Figure S8a). We
investigated the accumulation of the protein in transfected cells and found that mouse
ORCTL3 was considerably more stable (Supplementary Figure S8b). Moreover, the human
ORCTL3 interacted slightly weaker than mouse ORCTL3 with SCD1 (Supplementary
figure S8c). To determine whether it is the accumulation and interaction of the proteins or
whether the mouse ORCTL3 also comprises unique pro-apoptotic sequences, we mapped
the domain(s) responsible for this differential apoptosis effect starting with the smallest
ORCTL3 deletion construct that still induces apoptosis comprising the 5 N-terminal
transmembrane domains (TM5).7 While only the construct TM5 caused apoptosis, construct

TM2 was nevertheless expressed to an appreciable level as assessed by FACS analysis to
monitor sub-populations with various expression levels (Figure 5b and Supplementary
Figure S8d). These data suggested that the TM domains 3, 4, and 5 are required for
apoptosis induction. Since the construct TM3 was unstable, we focused our further finemapping on the TM domains 4 and 5. We found that when the TM5 was partially or fully
deleted (TM5b, TM5c) or when the loop between the 5th and the 6th TM was deleted
(TM5a), the protein was rendered unstable and inactive for apoptosis induction. A construct
harbouring the first four TM domains (TM4) was even more efficient than the larger
construct TM5 for apoptosis induction (Figure 5c). Apoptosis correlated with the expression
levels of the constructs (Supplementary Figure S8e). The minimal construct TM4 could still
be inhibited by SCD1 co-transfection (Supplementary Figure 8f). Given that the first four
TM domains were sufficient for apoptosis (TM4) and the first two TM domains were stable
but not active for apoptosis, we concentrated in a new round of mapping experiments on the
third and the forth TM domain. It is known that during protein synthesis pairs of TM
domains are co-inserted into the ER membrane.25 However, neither the two TM domains on
their own (TM34) nor when fused to the N-terminal signal sequence of ORCTL3 (NTM34),
or when attached to two arginine residues, which when flanking α-helical transmembrane
domains ensure their correct orientation in the membrane (NPosTM34), could elicit
apoptosis (Supplementary Figure S8g). All of these constructs were found not to be stable
(Supplementary Figure S8h).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We speculated that the two TM domains from mouse ORCTL3 could enable human
ORCTL3 to initiate apoptosis when put into the human sequence context. Figure 5d (top and
left bottom panel) reveals that the chimera (DSTM3&4) caused apoptosis as efficiently as
the mouse ORCTL3. The stability of the construct was substantially increased over the
human ORCTL3 (Supplementary Figure S8i). A sequence comparison indicated that both
TM domains comprise a number of amino acids that differ between mouse and human and
that the loop between the two TMs contains one exchange (Supplementary Figure S8j). We
swapped the TMs individually and converted the loop domain of the human ORCTL3 into
the mouse sequence (Supplementary Figure S8k). None of these constructs were capable of
apoptosis induction or accumulated to an appreciable level (Figure 5d right bottom panel).
When we inserted the two human TM domains into the mouse ORCTL3 gene
(DSTM3&4HtoM), despite its expression level being comparable with the mouse protein
(Supplementary Figure S8l), only a very modest apoptosis was observed (Figure 5d, right
bottom panel). We then asked whether apoptosis is a consequence of an incompatibility of
the mouse ORCTL3 protein in a human cellular environment but the mouse ORCTL3 gene
was also active for cell death in mouse N2a cells, in which it also accumulated to a higher
level than its human equivalent (Supplementary Figure S9).
An ORCTL3-expressing adenovirus causes tumour growth inhibition in vivo and retains its
specificity for malignant cells explanted from patients
As the above mapping results highlighted the requirement of sufficient accumulation of
ORCTL3 for apoptosis induction, we used an adenovirus vector, which can express genes to
high levels. Based on our observation that ORCTL3, when retained at the ER, is more
efficient for apoptosis,7 as also detected with the TM4 deletion mutant (Supplementary

Figure S10a), we inserted an ORCTL3-ER construct into the adenovirus genome. We first
adjusted the infection conditions so that we achieved equal expression in WT CV-1 cells and
the E1A-transfected variants. The same titres were then used to express ORCTL3 in the
other transformed cells. Figure 6a shows that ORCTL3 still did not cause cell death in the
non-transformed CV-1 cells but all transformed cells showed considerable cell death after
24 hours, including the E1A-transformed CV-1 cells that had not responded to the
transfection of the ORCTL3 expression plasmid (Figure 1f). When the extent of apoptosis
was normalised to the expression levels (Supplementary Figure S10b), it became evident
that ORCTL3 could induce cells death in 91% of myc-transformed CV-1 cells, in 72% of
E6-transformed cells, 50% of H-ras-, 55% of p53-transformed cells, 20% of E1A-expressing
cells and none in the WT CV-1 cells (Figure 6b). This efficiency and specificity was
supported by the apoptosis effects when the cells were infected twice, which likewise did
not indicate any toxicity in the WT CV-1 cells (Supplementary Figure S10c). To evaluate
the effects of ORCTL3 in an in vivo xenograft model we made use of the human clear cell
renal carcinoma cells Caki-2. In vitro experiments showed that these cells succumb to cell
death upon ORCTL3 expression by the adenovirus, particularly when infected repeatedly
(Supplementary Figure S10d,e). 2×106 of these cells were injected into the flanks of nude
mice and after the tumours reached approximately 50mm3 the ORCTL3-expressing
adenovirus or a luciferase control virus were injected once every 6 days and the size of the
tumours was determined. Figure 6c and Supplementary S10f,g show that in all tumours
ORCTL3 inhibited growth compared to the increase in tumour size seen with the luciferase
control over a period of six weeks after which the animals were sacrificed.

The ORCTL3-expressing adenovirus was then used on explanted primary renal tumour and
normal cells obtained from the same patient. A total of six tissue specimens (3 from normal
cortex and 3 from advanced kidney cancers of Fuhrman grade 3) were maintained in culture.
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) was diagnosed by a specialised pathologist in all
cases upon inspection of the tissues taken from the same tumorous lesions used for the
primary cell cultures. Similar to what has been reported26 normal kidney epithelial cells
showed higher proliferation rates than tumour cells and displayed a homogeneous
population of cells with cobblestone appearance, whilst ccRCC cells displayed flattened
polygonal morphology and many lipid vesicles in the cytoplasm (Figure 6d). The required
concentration of the virus was optimised by infecting normal and tumour cells and
examining the expression of ORCTL3 or GFP (Supplementary Figure S10h). Figure 6e
shows that in primary tumour cells from all patients ORCTL3 caused a specific apoptosisinducing signal (27, 22, and 23% cell death) but exerted negligible toxicity in normal renal
cells.

DISCUSSION
Anticancer genes have attracted considerable interest based on the expectation that the
specificity of their proteins would aid in defining their mode of action and reveal additional
targets in cancer treatment. For some anticancer genes, such as apoptin and par-4, several
aspects of their downstream signalling have been elucidated.27,28 For ORCTL3 we
identified here an effector - the fatty acid metabolism enzyme steaoryl-CoA desaturase
(SCD) - as a target responsible for ORCTL3’s tumour-specific pro-apoptotic effect in renal

tumours. This connection was discovered based on ORCTL3’s activation of an incomplete
ER stress response, which comprises the activation of ATF4 but not BiP (Figure 3e), and
which was also found when SCD was downregulated to initiate apoptosis.24 This cell death
was found to cause the demise of all tested tumour cells in one24 but not in another study23
suggesting that the cellular transformation scenario in which this enzyme can be targeted
had not yet been established.
We have found kidney cancers as a tumour model that responds to the inhibition of this
metabolic enzyme. This was indicated when individual tumourigenic mutations were
introduced into renal cells in an otherwise isogenic cell system (Figure 1, 6a,b) and when
kidney tumours were studied ex vivo (Figure 6e). Previous work from our group had already
shown that ORCTL3 is non-toxic to primary renal cells.7 So far the therapy of renal tumours
relies mainly on surgery. As they often do not respond to chemotherapy and radiotherapy,
there is hardly any systemic treatment against disseminated renal tumours.11 Consequently,
renal tumours constitute a model in which conventional drugs are failing and only recently
have targeted therapy treatments against VEGF and mTOR been approved for ccRCC.
Nevertheless, the vast majority of tumors eventually also become refractory.12

Studies on changes in the metabolism of cancer cells currently define a dynamic field. The
commonly held view is that the increase in the proliferation makes it imperative for
malignant cells to alter the metabolism of ATP production, macromolecule synthesis, redox
status, and fatty acids. Because of their increased proliferation, tumour cells are thought to
become dependent on (addicted to) desaturated fatty acids through their increased
requirement of phospholipids that constitute membranes.10 Our results represent a new
paradigm as the cells with tumourigenic mutations did not feature an increased proliferation
rate (Figure 2) but nevertheless became sensitive to the inhibition of the metabolic enzyme
and succumbed to ORCTL3. Most established antineoplastic agents act against rapidlyproliferating cells, which, however, is one of the reasons why these compounds also exert
considerable side effects in, for example, blood cells. Our data indicate that ORCTL3 does
not merely target cells with a higher proliferation rate (Figure 2).
SCD catalyzes the introduction of a double bond between carbons 9 and 10 of saturated fatty
acids and in particular palmitic (16:0) and stearic (18:0) acid to yield the monounsaturated
fatty acids palmitoleic (16:1) and oleic (18:1) acid, respectively. The presence of double
bonds in FA has been shown to increase the fluidity of the membrane, a feature that has
been implicated in facilitating tumour and metastasis formation.29,30 However, how specific
these effects are for tumour cells remained unknown. By comparing isogenic normal with
transformed renal cells we have shown here for the first time that inhibition of SCD is
synthetic lethal with transformation by various tumorigenic mutations (Figure 1, 4b, 6a,b).
Interestingly, the transformation of these cells is also accompanied by the upregulation of its
transcript (Figure 4f) confirming this gene as a treatment target, even though this was not
accompanied by an increase of the desaturation index (Figure 4d).
The role of SCD in obesity has been the focus of many studies most of which concluded that
targeted inhibition of SCD1 is effective in preventing diet-induced obesity 31 thus
establishing SCD1 as a therapeutic target for this indication. This finding in combination

with our data presented here suggest an interesting connection between obesity and cancer
through SCD1. Various studies concluded that obesity was associated with an increased risk
of developing cancer or metastasis.32-34 The abnormally elevated levels of SCD1 linked to
the metabolic alterations found in obesity, as well as diabetes, and the upregulated levels of
SCD1 in cancer cells, suggests SCD1 to be a molecular link between cancer and obesity.35
Its inhibition is positively correlated to preventing obesity31 and in this study we propose
that its inhibition by ORCTL3 overexpression also results in specific toxicity to renal cancer
cells.
We found ORCTL3 in a complex with Bap31 (Supplementary Figure S4b), a component of
the previously identified ARCosome22 and its apoptosis induction depends on the
components of this protein complex (Figure 3c,d). Various results presented here indicate
that the tumour-specific effect of ORCTL3 is accomplished through SCD inhibition and that
the activation of the ARCosome is a downstream effect: The pro-apoptotic cleavage product
of Bap31 cannot be inhibited for apoptosis induction by SCD1 co-transfection
(Supplementary Figure S5g) and does not impact on the desaturation index (Figure 4d).
Also, caspase-8, which is activated in the ARCosome22, is not inhibitable by the addition of
oleic acid and is not tumour-specific (Supplementary Figure S5b).

High affinity compounds against SCD have been already developed. In agreement with the
assumed higher specificity of anticancer genes and their encoded proteins, in vitro ORCTL3
elicited higher apoptosis and lower non-specific activity (background in normal tissue) than
the high affinity SCD1 inhibitor CAY10566 (Figure 4b and Figure 6b). For a therapeutic
application of ORCTL3 it is essential to efficiently introduce the gene into target cells. This
is evident by the increased apoptosis exerted by the adenovirus expressing ORCTL3 (Figure
1 and 6) and the difference between the human and the mouse ORCTL3, which seems to be
caused by the increased stability in combination with a higher affinity to SCD1 of the mouse
protein in cells (Figure 5, Supplementary Figure S8c). The stronger apoptosis activity of
mouse ORCTL3 was reflected by a slightly increased reduction of the desaturation index
(Figure 4d) suggesting that a critical enzyme inhibition has to be reached for cell death. The
ORCTL3-expressing adenovirus was more efficient in vitro (Figure S8e) than in vivo
(Figure 6c) in reducing the tumour cells. However, the hemorrhagic tissue observed in the
tumours could have obscured the in vivo effects, as indicated by the more pronounced size
difference when the tumours were removed from the animals (Figure S10g). Gene therapy
of tumours is still evolving but has recently made progress 36 and this work establishes proof
of concept and biological validation of an ORCTL3-based therapeutic application.
Previously we found that ORCTL3 is downregulated in a number of tumours suggesting that
it is a tumour suppressor gene, which when re-expressed in tumour cells, re-constitutes a
pro-apoptotic pathway that is initiated by oncogenes. However, since the human ORCTL3 is
less efficient for apoptosis induction, it is more likely that the overexpression of mouse
ORCTL3 creates a neomorphic mutation in the tumour cells. The finding that the transfer of
the 3rd and 4th TM domain from human to mouse retained its stability but did not lead to
apoptosis (Figure 5d) indicates that the two mouse TM domains have another function than
just providing sufficient protein stability. This is a surprising finding as interactions with
other proteins, if any, should be more conserved in the same species. Our data indicate that

for high protein stability at least two mouse TM domains, either the 1/2 or the 3/4 pair in the
correct context, are required. Accumulation within cells, however, is insufficient for
efficient apoptosis induction as exemplified by the chimeric constructs with the human 3/4
TM domains (Figure 5d). Hence, for efficient apoptosis the mouse TM domains 3/4 are
necessary.

We have in this work focused on renal cancer, but our previous data indicate that ORCTL3
is active against a wide variety of cancers.7 Future studies have to address the range of
tumours that can be targeted with ORCTL3.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DNA constructs
The mouse WT ORCTL3 and its ER fusion construct have been described.7 Deletion
mutants and domain swapping were generated using suitable primers and recombinant PCR
with Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes). PCR products were subcloned
into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and fused to an HA-tag at the
C-terminal ends either by conventional restriction digestion and subsequent ligation using
T4 DNA ligase (Promega) or by PCR Cloning using In-Fusion™ Advantage Kit (Clontech

Cell culture

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

CV-1 cells (ATCC no: CCL-7), which are untransformed normal kidney fibroblasts, HeLa
cells (ATCC no: CCL-2), HEK293T cells,7 and N2a cells (M.Sastre, Imperial College) were
cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (SigmaAldrich). CV-1 cells were cotransfected by a plasmid containing the G418 resistance gene
and an empty control vector or the gene of interest in a 1:9 ratio using Xfect transfection
reagent (Clontech) and selected using 2.5mg/ml G418 (Gibco). HeLa cells were transfected
with JetPEI (Peqlab) or Effectene (Qiagen) and HEK293T cells were transfected with Xfect
(Clontech) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All cell lines were validated by
short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profiles prior to the start of the project.
MTT assay
CV-1 cells were cultured in a 96-well plate at a density of 5×103 cells/well containing 100μl
complete phenol red-free DMEM medium (Sigma-Aldrich). 20 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT solution
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well and the manufacturer’s protocol followed.
Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed by propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry.
Cells were cultured for 72 hours in 24-well plates in complete DMEM. Cells were
harvested, washed, and stained with PI lysis buffer (10μg/ml PI (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.05%
sodium citrate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.05% Triton (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS). The fluorescent

Caki-2 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium with 10%
FCS. At 24hours and 4hours before inoculation, the cells in culture were fed with fresh
medium. At the time of inoculation cells were harvested, resuspended in media-free of
serum and antibiotics, and kept under sterile conditions in sterile bijous. To form bilateral
tumours 2×106 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in a volume of 100 l into the right and
the left flank of each female nude mice. When tumour size reached 50-80mm3 ORCTL3- or
luciferase-expressing adenovirus (50 l of 5×109 viral particles) was injected intratumouraly
once every 6 days to investigate the therapeutic potential of ORCTL3.
Collection and isolation of primary renal cells
Human kidney tissue samples were obtained from patients undergoing radical nephrectomy
for renal cell carcinoma at Charing Cross Hospital (London). Tissue was collected from
areas macroscopically identified as normal or tumourous immediately after extracting the
specimen by an expert pathologist (tissue bank licence number 12275). Isolation procedure
was performed within an hour of tissue removal according to an established protocol 26.
Adenoviral infection

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Three different adenoviruses (constructed and produced by Welgen, Inc) were used
expressing ORCTL3-ER cDNA, luciferase as a negative control, and GFP as an infection
efficiency control. Cells were plated at low density (20×103 cells/well of 24 well plate) and
cultured overnight. On the day of infection, cells from one representative well were counted.
Viruses at an original concentration of 1×1012 virions/ml were diluted in 2% FCS DMEM to
obtain the required multiplicity of infection (MOI). 200μl of virus-containing medium was
added to the cells, which were incubated for 7 hours. After which the cells were washed and
kept in 10% DMEM until analysed. Primary renal carcinoma cells from patient #3 lacking
the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) were infected with the help of AdBooster
(Vector Biolabs). The appropriate amount of the adenovirus was incubated with the
recommended amount of the reagent in 2% FCS medium for 30 minutes at room
temperature on a rotating wheel. The same procedure of the viral infection above was
followed.
Immunofluorescence
Cells transfected with HA-tagged plasmids were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (SigmaAldrich) 24 hrs post transfection. Fixed cells were stained with Alexa flour 488-labellebd
monoclonal antibody against HA (Covance Inc.) as described 22.
Apoptosis quantification
Apoptosis in HeLa, HEK293T, CaKi2 and primary cells was quantified using 3,3′dihexylocarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6)/propidium iodide (PI) double staining and flow
cytometry as described.37 Apoptosis in normal CV1 and transformed CV1 was determined

by phenotype quantification as described.7 For the FDA assay harvested cells were
resuspended in 200μl of 2μg/ml FDA (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, incubated for 15 min at 37°
C, and analysed on flow cytometer with excitation at 488nm using FL1 channel.
Cell lysate preparation

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cell were lysed in 100μl RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris pH 8 (Sigma-Aldrich),
150 mM sodium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% SDS (Biorad), 0.5% deoxycholate (SigmaAldrich)) containing 1x protease inhibitor (Thermo Scientific) and incubated on ice for 30
minutes. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,300 rpm for 30 minutes at 4°C.
Western blot analysis
Using BCA protein assay (Sigma Aldrich), equal amounts of proteins were denatured with
1X protein loading buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific) at 100°C for 10 minutes. Samples were
electrophoresed in an SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Millipore) by semidry electroblotting (Bio-Rad) as described.22 Membranes
were probed with primary antibodies for HRas (1:200; sc-520, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
c-Myc (1:200; sc-789, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p53 (1:500; sc-126, Santa Cruz

Co-immunoprecipitation
After harvesting the cells and washing them once with PBS, they were lysed in 500μl Tris/
Triton buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1%
triton X-100) together with protease inhibitors on ice for 30 mins. Cell lysates were then
processed as described22 with the relevant antibody -HA (H3663, mouse monoclonal,
Sigma) (1:100) or -SCD1 (sc30435, goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz) (1:100). Isotype-specific
antibodies were used in the controls.
Fatty acid analysis
Total fatty acid composition of frozen CV1 cells was determined by gas chromatography
following total lipid extraction and transesterification according to Lepage and Roy (1986)
with modifications38. Briefly, 1 ml of methanol/toluene (4:1) was added to frozen CV1
pellets followed by vortexing and sonification. Acetyl chloride (100 μl) was added to cell
lipid extract suspension then incubated for 2 hours at 60°C. Extraction suspensions were
cooled to room temperature and 2.5 ml of 6% K2CO3 solution was added to each sample.
The organic phase was then transferred to GC vials, evaporated to dryness under a stream of
nitrogen then dissolved in 300 μl of n-hexanes. Samples were then analysed by gas

against HA as shown in Fig S8B. (c) Caki-2 renal carcinoma cells were engrafted bilaterally
into the flanks of nu/nu BALB/c mice. ORCTL3 or luciferase expressing adenovirus were
weekly (*) injected intratumouraly. The size of the tumours was determined by caliper
measurements twice a week. Error bars indicate the standard error of the means. (d)

Morphology of representative normal and tumour cells explanted from three ccRCC
patients. (e) The cells in (d) were infected with an MOI of 5000 of ORCTL3- and luciferaseexpressing adenovirus and apoptosis was quantified by DiOC6/PI and flow cytometry
analysis. Data are the means of representative experiments, patient #1:n=3; patients #2 and
#3:n=2. The background level generated by luciferase infection was subtracted from each
reading.
