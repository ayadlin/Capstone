ABSTRACT
The concept that the B-cell Receptor (BCR) initiates a driver pathway in
lymphoma-leukemia has been clinically validated. Previously described unique BCR
Ig-class-specific sequences (proximal domains (PDs)), are not expressed in serum Ig
(sIg). As a consequence of sequence and structural differences in the membrane IgM
(mIgM) µ-Constant Domain 4, additional epitopes distinguish mIgM from sIgM. mAbs
generated to linear and conformational epitopes, restricted to mIgM and not reacting
with sIgM, were generated despite the relative hydrophobicity of the PDm sequence.
Anti-PD mAbs (mAb1, mAb2, and mAb3) internalize mIgM. Anti-mIgM mAb4, which
recognizes a distinct non-ligand binding site epitope, mediates mIgM internalization,
and in low-density cultures, growth inhibition, anti-clonogenic activity, and apoptosis.
We show that mAb-mediated mIgM internalization generally does not interrupt BCRdirected cell growth, however, mAb4 binding to a non-ligand binding site in the mIgM
PDm-μC4 domain induces both mIgM internalization and anti-tumor effects. BCR
micro-clustering in many B-cell leukemia and lymphoma lines is demonstrated by
SEM micrographs using these new mAb reagents. mAb4 is a clinical candidate as a
mediator of inhibition of the BCR signaling pathway. As these agents do not bind to
non-mIgM B-cells, nor cross-react to non-lymphatic tissues, they may spare B-cell/
normal tissue destruction as mAb-drug conjugates.

INTRODUCTION

cells” detectable by PCR [8]. These findings suggest
that anti-id therapy can induce lineage-specific celldifferentiation and/or pathway regulatory effects [8].
An investigation of the mechanisms of anti-id
resistance demonstrated that CDR sequence mutation
variants, rather than loss of the mIg structure, were
responsible for treatment failure [9-11]. Thus, signaling
emanating from the BCRC with new mutated CDRs
was responsible for persistence of the malignant
phenotype. Subsequently, molecular studies demonstrated
that Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) B-cells
were in a constitutively activated state, recapitulating
normal receptor-antigen-mediated activation, leading
to proliferation and differentiation programs normally
initiated by the BCRC [12, 13]. The complexity of these
initiating activation steps is further emphasized by the

The B-cell Receptor Complex (BCRC) emerged
as a molecular target for the therapy of leukemia and
lymphoma with the advent of personalized anti-idiotype
(anti-id) monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology [1,
2]. Complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of
cell surface membrane-Immumoglobulins (mIg) were
recognized as both patient-unique “tumor specific”
targets and as the critical regulatory element in the
neoplastic process [3-8]. A “proof-of-principle” clinical
study published in 1998 demonstrated that patientspecific, custom made anti-id mAbs, given alone or with
other agents, induced objective measurable and durable
responses [8]. Of note in this report was that patients in
prolonged clinical remission harbored “dormant tumor

observation that BCRC signaling can also be propagated
through non-Immune-receptor Tyrosine-based Activation
Motifs (ITAM) or by endocytosed receptors [14-15].
These findings support the contention that anti-id mAbs
modulate tonic BCRC-mediated B-cell signaling leading
to differentiation of malignant cells, dormancy, and/or
induction of apoptosis [3-8]. Based on these observations,
key downstream pathways of the BCRC have been
identified and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI) have been developed. The robust anti-tumor effects
of these agents have now been demonstrated in clinical
trials and provide “proof-of-principle” in support of the
hypotheses regarding the central role of BCRC signaling
in the molecular biology of B-cell malignancies [16-20].
Therefore, the development of additional agents to control
the constitutively activated BCRC signaling is warranted,
especially those targeting the BCR itself.
As a consequence of mIgM sequence homology
to serum IgM (sIgM), specific B-cell mIgM targeting in
vivo was thought not to be feasible, except for the anti-id,
patient-specific CDR approach. However, the subsequent
finding of unique class-specific sequences identified in
mIg receptors, designated as “proximal domains” (PDs),
that are not contained in the corresponding secreted Ig
protein sequences (mRNA splice variants) (Genbank),
opened new discovery pathways. These PD sequences
represent potential cell surface epitope targets specific to
each Ig class. mAbs reacting with the mIgE PD have been
demonstrated to induce apoptosis [21]. Thus, the PD may
be critical in transmitting mIg receptor transmembranesignaling to the closely associated CD79α/β cytoplasmic
tyrosine kinase (TK), and anti-PD mAbs may, in general,
be able to modulate signaling [21]. This concept that
mAbs that do not bind to, or block receptor ligand-binding
sites, their ligands, or receptor dimerization sites, but can
be potent inhibitors of receptor TK-mediated signaling,
has already been established in vitro [22] and validated
in the clinic.
Major alterations in the PD-µConstant Domain 4
(µC4) juncture further differentiate sIgM and mIgM and
provide additional neo-epitopes and functional capabilities
for specific targeting. For example, the µC4 domain of
mIgM is differentiated from sIgM µC4 by a 20 amino acid
truncation, loss of the J-chain binding site, and loss of a
glycosylation site, which taken together generate unique
epitopes associated with a new functional site: an active
mIgM clustering/signaling domain [23-27].
Here we present the biologic effects of novel antiPD mAbs. In contrast to the apoptotic effects observed
in the anti-mIgE-PD system, only one of the anti-PDm
mAbs significantly inhibited cell growth or induced
apoptosis [28]. This mAb, with partial conformationdependent binding spanning the PDm-µC4 juncture,
manifests receptor internalization, cell growth inhibition,
anti-clonogenic activity [29], anti-stem-cell activity [30],
and apoptosis in low-density cultures [31].

Generation of hybridoma clones
Because the mIgM PD peptide is relatively
hydrophobic, generating high avidity mAbs required
novel immunization strategies. Its 13-mer sequence is
comprised of five hydrophobic amino acids V, A, F, and
two Gs, in addition to amino acid S which has a relatively
low hydrophobicity index. Thus, stabilizing these peptides
with carrier immunogens was essential for immunization
and in vitro screening assays. Given the hydrophobicity
of the PDm sequence, it was initially unclear whether it
was partially contained in the plasma membrane or was
completely in the extracellular space and accessible for
mAb binding.
With the goal of specifically modulating mIgMCD79α/β signaling, mAbs targeting the PDm sequence
and the contiguous proximal extra-cellular domain of the
mIgM (µC4) were generated. Proprietary immunization
techniques for hydrophobic peptide immunogens were
employed. Panels of peptide-specific mAbs detecting the
13-mer peptide PDm sequence (EGEVSADEEGFEN),
specific for mIgM, and the 18-mer peptide PDg sequence
(ELQLEESCAEAQDGELDG), specific for mIgG, were
generated first. Three candidate mAbs (mAb1, mAb2, and
mAb3), detecting PDm, were selected for further testing.
In these studies an anti-PDg mAb11.1 (mouse IgG1)
served as both positive and negative isotype control mAb
in specificity and biologic studies. The initial screening
and clone selection which yielded mAb1, mAb2, and
mAb3 was based on ELISA, Hemagglutination (HA),
Western blots, and Scanning Immune Electron Microscopy
(SEM) assays, all of which demonstrated binding to (1)
PDm peptide, (2) mIgM cell lysate protein fractions, and
(3) cultured mIgM+ expressing cell lines: CA 46 (CRL
1648), SU-DHL-5 (CRL 2958), Ramos (CRL 1596),
Namalwa (CRL 1432), ST 486 (CRL 1647), MC 116
(CRL 1649), and HT (CRL 2260).
Using a high affinity anti-PDm mAb (mAb1),
NP-40 cell lysates containing mIgM were immuneaffinity chromatography purified and used to immunize
additional sets of mice. From these immunizations,
second-generation mAbs detecting conformational
BCRC epitopes, but not reacting with sIgM in ELISA
assays and Western blots, were collected. One of these
mAbs, designated mAb4, is differentiated by manifesting
additional biologic activities, such as inducing B-cell
growth inhibition, as assessed by MTT technology applied
to clonogenic limiting dilution assays [22]. This finding
emphasizes the need to probe native proteins as a source
of biologically active mAbs. These four mAbs, designated
mAb1, mAb2, mAb3, and mAb4 (collectively referred to
as the “mAb panel”) were selected for further studies.

Specificity analyses

low-affinity hydrophobic binding, a modified HA assay of
intact cells (see Materials and Methods) and ELISA assays
using cell lysates were performed. The results are scored
as either positive (+) or negative (-) and both lymphatic
and non-lymphatic cells lines were tested in the HA
and cell lysate assays. A portion of these cell lines were
prescreened by RT-PCR to confirm mIgM expression.
The results show that each of the mAbs recognizes cells
or their lysates from only those cells containing the PDm,
confirming their specificity for the native target (Table
1B: Rows 1 and 2). Negative control mIgG- and mIgEexpressing cells (Table 1B: Rows 3-5), as well as all
of the Non-Lymphatic cell lines (Table 1B: Rows 6-9),
were negative in both assays. We found that all cell lines
expressing IgM by RT-PCR were also positive for mIgM
by Western blot (data not shown). In some cell lines,
mIgM expression was very low, < 10,000 receptors per
cell as determined from SEM estimates (e.g. CRL 1648;
Figure 1A-1C). Furthermore, reactivity with our panel of
anti-PD mAbs suggested that when mIgM was detectable
in cell lysates (ELISA assays), it was also present on
the cell surface (HA assays) (Table 1B), correlating cell
protein expression with cell surface expression.
Investigations with SEM also confirmed the
cell-surface localization of the mIgM on intact viable
target cells (Figure 1A-1C). Taken together, as cell
lines were found to express mIgM in HA assays, cell

Serial assays testing each hybridoma clone’s
specificity were used to select and further characterize the
clinical candidates comprising the final mAb panel. In all
specificity assays (Table 1A-1E), isotype-matched IgG1
and IgG2 antibodies (Abs) served as negative controls
and anti-mIgG and anti-huIgM served as positive controls
for the specified substrate (four columns on the right hand
side of the tables). The first set of screens employed plates
coated with molecular constructs consisting of (1) carrier
alone, (2) peptides alone, (3) carrier with C- or N-terminal
conjugation and peptides, (4) purified membrane fractions,
and (5) two isomers of the PDm (Table 1A). As expected
those constructs that lacked the PDm sequence were
negative (Table 1A: Rows 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10) while those
that contained PDm were positive (Table 1A: Rows 2,
4, 7, 9, 11, 12). Table 1A (Rows 13 and 14) shows PDm
peptides with a V to N amino acid substitution at position
4 (Isomer 1) and an A to E substitution at position 6
(Isomer 2). mAb4 was the only one of the four mAbs to
be significantly affected by these changes suggesting that
it is sterically inhibited.
To determine whether the mAbs are capable of
binding to the specific PDm sequence in the native state,
and to eliminate the possibility of artifactual, non-specific,

lysate ELISA assays, SEM, and mIgM RT-PCR, these
results suggest a strong correlation between mRNA
expression, mIgM protein synthesis, and cell surface
expression. These results are also in agreement with
ATCC cell line mIgM expression data. In addition, HA/
ELISA data indicated that the four mAbs do not crossreact nor detect any determinants on the surface of the
non-mIgM expressing B-cell lines or the epithelial/non-

lymphatic cell lines tested (p < 0.05) (Table 1B). Thus,
these assays demonstrate both the restricted nature of
mIgM expression, and lack of cross-reactive determinants
in a variety of non-B-cell lineages. Therefore, the PDm
sequence is not detected by immunologic means in nonmIgM-expressing cells. Isotype-matched control mouse
mAbs, and anti-epithelial Abs were negative for B-cell
lines, ruling out non-specific Fc receptor binding (Table

for experiments examining mIgM cell surface expression
and experiments measuring the reduction in signal due to
antigen internalization (data not shown).
HA was originally designed as a methodology
to rapidly assess Ab cell-surface binding to adherent
target cells, and was adapted here for non-adherent or
weakly-adherent cells (see Materials and Methods:
Hemadsorption/Hemagglutinin assays). Using diluted
test samples, this assay became especially sensitive
in detecting non-rosetted cells. Thus, it was useful in
confirming that virtually all cells within the positive
cell lines were HA positive, and heterogeneity of mIgM
expression, for positive and negative cells, was not
detectable with any of the four mAbs tested and in any of
the cell lines tested (Table 1B). The protein G-RBC also
weakly detected IgG-expressing B-cells even without the
addition of mAb, indicating its weak binding to surfaceexpressed mIgG. As this binding was blocked by preincubation of protein G-RBCs with control IgG2a, it
indicates that the protein G-RBC HA reaction is mediated
by the protein G-Ig binding. In these mIgG-expressing
cells, HA background was as high as 30%.
ELISA assays testing the reactivity of the mAbs
to the immunogen molecular constructs (bound to solid
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phase) further demonstrate the restrictive reactivity of
the four mAbs in our panel. No reactivity was observed
with carrier proteins keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)
or multiple antigen peptide (MAP), or with PDg when
bound to KLH, MAP, or used without carrier. Observed
reactivity was restricted to free or conjugated PDm (p <
0.05) (Table 1A).
A critical finding shown here is the relatively
enhanced reactivity of mAb4 to purified native mIgM
(Table 1A: Rows 11, 12) compared to its binding to
PDm-containing structures (Table 1A: Rows 2, 4, 7, 9)
particularly when compared to mAb1, mAb2, and mAb3
binding patterns. Both the Perfect FOCUSTM lysate
fraction, and the same fraction further enriched for mIgM
by mAb1-Immune-affinity chromatography (Perfect
FOCUSTM + IA), showed preferred mAb4 binding (p <
0.05). These findings suggest that mAb4 has preferential
binding to the intact native mIgM protein when compared
to the PDm peptide and that its epitope may reside
predominantly in the µC4 domain or may depend on this

The two isomeric forms of the PDm (Table 1A:

or Perfect FOCUSTM purified mIgM fraction (p < 0.05).
These isomeric forms have a single amino acid variant
each, substituting N for V and E for A at positions 4
and 6 in the 13-mer PDm, rendering these forms more
hydrophilic than the most common isomer used in this
study for immunization. These mAbs therefore cannot
be used to distinguish the different mIgM isomeric forms
and further investigations are needed to determine their
biologic differences.
The positive control goat anti-huIgM reagent is not
reactive with PDm or its conjugated structures, but does
recognize the mIgM-purified samples (p < 0.05) (Tables
1A-1E). This indicates that common commercial human
IgM preparations, used for immunizations to generate
anti-huIgM research reagents, do not contain the PDm
sequence or PDm is too weak in this context to induce
an immune response. To further confirm the direct mAb
binding ELISA assay (Table 1A), more sensitive inhibition
of ELISA mAb binding assays are shown in Table 1C,
confirming the highly selective specificity of these Abs.
To determine if, in vivo, mIgM-containing
immunogenic PDm or µC4 are secreted or released from
live cells by enzymatic means or by an apoptotic process,
normal human serum, purified hu-IgM, and serum from
Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia patients were each
tested, bound to solid phase in ELISA assays, and found
to be non-reactive with the mAb panel (p < 0.05) (Table
1D). To confirm these results, higher sensitivity inhibition
assays were conducted using the same sera samples, now
pre-incubated in antigen excess with the mAbs prior to
use in ELISA assays, such as the direct binding to the
Perfect-FOCUSTM purified mIgM fraction (Table 1E).
These inhibitory assays confirmed the results of the
direct binding assays (p < 0.05). Following these initial
experiments, an expanded panel of sera from normal
patients, and a variety of patients with lymphatic and nonlymphatic malignancies, were tested, and demonstrated
a lack of circulating mIgM in serum. In contrast, fresh
frozen CLL cells (1 x 106 cells in DMSO) almost
completely absorbed each of the mAbs (1 µg/ml), and
thus reduced mAb binding in direct binding assays to
the Perfect-FOCUSTM purified mIgM fraction (p < 0.05)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Table 1E). These fresh frozen CLL purified mononuclear
cells separated by Ficoll-Hypaque technology were a
source for NP-40 lysates and Perfect FOCUSTM fractions
for immune-affinity chromatography, immunizations, and
ELISA assays.
SEM was used to investigate the cell binding
patterns of the panel of mAbs to B-cell lines and to
confirm the results of the HA and ELISA assays. The
cell surface spatial array of mIgM receptor is poorly
understood with regards to polymerization of mIgM
by the µC4 clustering-domain, and to non-covalent
CD79α/β complexing. We explored whether the PDm
or µC4 clustering-domain is actively complexed on the
cell surface and whether the mAb epitopes can still be
detected in the presence of mIgM clustering. Except for
PDm, class-specific PDs contain cysteines, which are
hypothesized to be responsible for cross-linking mIg.
mAbs detecting these PDs need to recognize the crosslinked PD. In the absence of cysteines in PDm, whether
the hydrophobic nature of the PDm mediates its crosslinking is not supported by experimental data [25-27]. For
this reason, SEM was carried out to provide additional
evidence of mAbs binding to the cell surface of mIgMexpressing cells (Figure 1A-1F) but not to non-expressors.
At higher magnification, “small” micro-clusters of mIgM
were visualized by the gold-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig
reagent (Figure 1G, 1H). As these “small” micro-clusters
were visualized in glutaraldehyde-fixed cells, they are
not a consequence of mAb-induced clustering, but rather
represent de novo clustered mIgM. Similar complexes
have been identified in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
cell lines (DLBCL); however, it is unclear whether they
correspond to the micro-clustering previously described
in DLBCL samples [25-27]. The two DLBCL cell lines
both demonstrated large clusters likely representing the
previously described micro-clustering [25-27]. The cell
line CRL 1648 represents a B-cell line with relatively low
mIgM expression based on “DIM” light chain reactivity
by flow cytometric analysis, similar to CLL cells, and
is shown in Figure 1A-1C. This cell line is not thought
to be derived from a DLBCL patient. Similar “small’
micro-clusters were found in all the B-cell lines examined

These results demonstrate the accessibility of each mAb
to their respective epitope in the mIgM clustered state.

itself (p < 0.05). The results suggest that for PDm, KLHPDm, and Perfect FOCUSTM + IA chromatography
fraction, mAb1 and mAb4 each detected a distinct epitope
while mAb2 and mAb3 detected another defined epitope
that is partially shared. mAb4, while binding to PDm,
showed relatively improved binding to purified mIgM
(Perfect FOCUSTM + IA) vs. PDm (p < 0.05), especially
when compared to the patterns of reactivity of the other
mAbs, again suggesting preferential binding to a naturally
derived-PDm epitope or a conformational dependency
provided by µC4.
Inhibition assays, testing 6-mer peptides for their
ability to block the mAbs binding to peptide or the
Perfect FOCUSTM + IA purified fraction in solid-phase
ELISA assays, were conducted to confirm the data from
the mAb epitope mapping studies, and to more precisely
define the target epitopes (Table 3). The 6-mer A-peptide
(EGEVSA) and 6-mer B-peptide (EEGFEN) were used in
molar excess (X100) compared to the mAb-HRP. These
studies demonstrated that mAb4 detected a distinct epitope
not substantially blocked by either the 6-mer A-peptide
or B-peptide. While mAb1 was not blocked by the 6-mer
B-peptide, mAb1 was strongly blocked by the 6-mer
A-peptide (p < 0.05), and mAb2 and mAb3 were partially
blocked by both 6-mer A-peptide and B-peptide (p <
0.05). It should be noted that the high level of hydrophobic
amino acids in A-peptide: G, V, and A, and in B-peptide:
G, and F; may affect results of this assay due to solubility
characteristics. Thus, the partial blocking of mAb2 and
mAb3 by the 6-mers may represent relative avidity or
solubility issues. Taking these uncertainties together
prevents clear epitope target designations for mAb2
and mAb3. mAb1 is blocked by the most hydrophobic
sequences, emphasizing the unusual nature of this Ab.
For this reason, we show the SEM demonstrating its cell

Fine molecular epitope mapping by competitive
mAb binding and peptide inhibition
Epitope binding for each of the mAbs was
determined using four complimentary assays, 1) mAb
blocking of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled mAb
binding to antigen in ELISA assays, 2) specific peptide
inhibition of HRP-labeled mAb binding to antigen in
ELISA assays, 3) specific peptide inhibition of mAb cell
surface binding to target cells as determined by SEM, and
4) mAb cell surface binding to target cells as determined
by SEM using isotype specific probes.
Protein labeling techniques for direct HRP
conjugation to mAb allowed for testing of inhibition of
mAb-HRP binding in solid-phase ELISA assays. By using
excess unlabeled mAb to block labeled mAb-HRP binding
(Table 2), the following groups of clones were defined:
those blocking the labeled mAb (same epitope), those not
blocking the labeled mAb (different epitope), and those
partially blocking the labeled mAb (a near epitope or
weaker binding). In separate experiments each mAb was
labeled with HRP and the inhibitory unlabeled blocking
mAb assay was repeated until all the clones were epitope
defined. mAb1 did not block mAb2, mAb3, or mAb4, but
is self-blocked by unlabeled mAb1 (p < 0.05); mAb2 did
not block mAb1 or mAb4, but did partially block mAb3,
and unlabeled mAb2 blocked itself (p < 0.05). These
results were similar for mAb3 analysis showing partial
blocking by excess mAb2 (p < 0.05). mAb4 demonstrated
lack of blocking by mAb1, mAb2, and mAb3 but blocked

binding in Figure 1D.
In an effort to better assign a specific epitope target
for these mAbs, additional studies were carried out using
a 15-mer peptide, extending the 13-mer PDm into the µC4
domain. These studies indicated that mAb4 had a modest
(<10%), but statistically insignificant increase in binding
to the extended 15-mer compared to the 13-mer (p > 0.05),
while there was no change in mAb2 and mAb3 binding.
In addition, the 15-mer had low, non-significant blocking
activity in mAb4 binding to the Perfect FOCUSTM + IA
purified fraction (data not shown). These data again
suggest that mAb4 binds only weakly to the PDm, and
more robustly to a proximal µC4 epitope not contained in
the 15-mer, or that its epitope is partially conformational
and it is not represented well in linear hydrophobic
peptides, which may have alternative folding patterns.
SEM studies were used to confirm results of the
ELISA blocking experiments. The binding of mAbs to
glutaraldehye-fixed CRL 1648 cells was determined by
SEM after incubation of the mAbs with excess PDm
peptide or 6-mers (x500). mAb1, mAb2, and mAb3
binding to the cell surface of CRL 1648 was blocked by
PDm peptide or their respective 6-mer, as seen by SEM
testing, whereas mAb4 was not fully blocked, and binding
to the CR-1648 cell surface, while reduced, was readily
detected (data not shown).
To further examine the mAb4 epitope, SEM studies

were carried out on fixed CRL 1648 cells incubated with
mAb1. Isotype specific goat anti-mouse IgG1 gold-labeled
reagent did not detect the bound IgG2b mAb1, but when
the IgG1 mAb4 was subsequently added it was able to
detect bound mAb4. The anti-mouse IgG1-gold reagent
complex detected IgG1 mAb4, bound to the surface of
glutaraldehyde-fixed CRL 1648 cells, pre-incubated with
the IgG2b mAb2, indicating that mAb2 binds to a different
epitope than mAb4 and does not block mAb4 cell binding
(data not shown).

mAb-induced receptor internalization
When viable cells were examined, initial SEM
studies indicated that detection of cell surface bound mAb
or mouse anti-huIgM sera was both time and temperature
dependent. Incubation of mAb or polyclonal mouse
anti-huIgM sera at 4 °C for 30 mins was compared to
incubation at 37 °C for 30 mins. At 37 °C, neither mAb
nor mouse anti-huIgM reagent was detectable, but if
incubated at 4 °C, cell surface bound mAb and mouse antihuIgM was detectable. These findings were interpreted
as Ab modulation of receptor mIgM expression, being
consistent with Ab-induced receptor internalization, a
metabolic process that is reduced at 4 °C. Fixation with
glutaraldehyde was also demonstrated to stop this biologic

internalization process and preserve detection of cell
surface mIgM by bound Ab. Binding of these mAbs, as
determined by SEM, to glutaraldehyde-fixed CRL 1648
B-cell line is shown in Figures 1A-1F and demonstrates
the low density expression of these mIgM molecules.
Using protein G-RBCs for cell surface mAb
detection, cells pre-fixed with glutaraldehyde prior to the
addition of the mAbs or mouse anti-huIgM sera preserve
cell surface mAb detection at both 37 °C and 4 °C (Table
4). These findings also indicate that the epitopes for the
mAbs are preserved with glutaraldehyde fixation. SEM
assays and protein G-RBC assays are both sensitive and
robust, as in control experiments or isotype-matched
HA, background gold-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig reagent
(Figure 1I, 1J) or background rosetting, respectively, is
not observed after glutaraldehyde fixation. A time-elapsed
SEM series of micrographs is shown in Figure 1 (A
and B, compared to K and L, respectively). At 15 mins
(Figure 1K) and 30 mins (Figure 1L) of mAb4 incubation
at 37 °C, followed by fixation to stop the internalization
process, the majority of mAb internalization has already
occurred even at the earliest time points measured (Figure
1K). Background goat anti-mouse Ig labeled gold is not
observed.
Additional SEM studies show that mAb4-mediated
internalization of mIgM by incubation of CRL 1648 cells
at 37 °C for 30 mins resulted in a lack of detectable mIgM
on the cell surface by testing cells with the mAb panel
or polyclonal mouse anti-huIgM heavy chain reagent
for binding after the mAb4 incubation (Figure 1L). For
example, in an additional confirmatory experiment using
protein G-RBC as the detection method, cells were
exposed to mAb4 at 37 °C for 30 mins, fixed, and then
tested for mIgM expression using polyclonal mouse antihuIgM heavy chain reagent (similar to Table 4, live cells at
37 °C, 30 min). Lack of protein G-RBC rosetting indicates
a lack of residual cell surface bound mAb4 and an absence
of mouse anti-huIgM heavy chain reagent detection of
residual cell surface mIgM. Similar experiments testing
mAb1-, mAb2-, and mAb3-mediated internalization of
mIgM by incubation of CRL 1648 cells at 37 °C for 30
mins also resulted in a lack of detectable mIgM on the cell
surface using mAbs or anti-huIgM heavy chain reagent (p
< 0.05). These finding suggest that all mAbs in the panel
mediate virtually complete mIgM internalization, and
thus each mAb recognized all forms of mIgM as defined
by the mouse anti-huIgM heavy chain reagent reactivity.
Similar results were observed in all mIgM-expressing
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

B-cell lines in our cell panel. At 1 µg/ml of mAb/106
B-cells, internalization is complete at 30 mins (p < 0.05),
suggesting this ratio represents a state of mAb excess for
this cell line.
Table 4 (Rows 3 and 4) shows that, as with
glutaraldehyde, low temperature also limited
internalization. In addition, these results show that
glutaraldehyde fixation did not substantially affect mAb4
binding to target (comparing results of Rows 1 and 2 to 3
and 4; Table 4). Timed experiments demonstrated that, by
30 mins at 37 °C (Table 4: Rows 9, 10), the pre-treated
cells’ capacity to adsorb mAb4-HRP from solution is
reduced, without a significant difference between PBS
and acetate wash (pH 4.0) (p < 0.05), suggesting that
mIgM and mAb4 are predominantly internalized by 30
mins and are no longer free on the cell membrane to bind
mAb4-HRP after acetate washing. The lack of residual
cell surface mIgM resulted in no reduction of mAb4-HRP
binding to mIgM solid phase in ELISA assays because cell
mIgM was already internalized by pre-incubation with
mAb4 at 37 °C. Thus, there was no mAb4-HRP absorption
capacity by these cells whether they were washed with
PBS or acetate (pH 4.0) (p < 0.05). The robust mAbinduced internalization is demonstrated by lack of cell
surface mIgM available for inhibition of mAb4-HRP or
anti-huIgM test reagents subsequently used in ELISA
assays. Similar experiments with each mAb confirmed
mIgM internalization.
Experiments demonstrate that increasing cell culture
times with mAb4 (at 37 °C) reduced the amount of cell
surface mIgM as assessed by SEM, protein G-RBCs, and
cell adsorption after the cells are washed in acid.

Biologic activity
Due to the uniqueness of the amino acid sequence of
PDm and low homology to other GenBank sequences, we
hypothesized that PDm may be involved in propagating
receptor signaling functional activity to the cytoplasmic
CD79α/β TK signaling domain, as was reported for PDe
[21]. Thus, growth, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
clonogenicity assays of CRL 1648 cells were performed
to determine whether the anti-PDm mAbs modulated these
processes.

Limiting dilution assays and cell density
experiments

be distinguished by dilutions of sets of identical numbers
of plated cells in different media volumes. If the absolute
number of stem cells determines the cell growth kinetics
in the presence of mAb4, then stem cell number is critical
regardless of volume. If, however, increasing the volume
of media of these same sets of plated numbers of viable
cells reduces cell growth kinetics, then a soluble factor
concentration is the critical determinant of growth in
the presence of mAb4 (Table 5). We therefore examined
whether the number of cells plated per well, or relative cell
density or cells/volume media, as determined by well size
and media volume, correlate to optimal mAb4 anti-tumor
effects. These experiments tested whether the mAb4 effect
is directly modulating the functional activity of stem cells
by inducing stem cell apoptosis or is competing with prosurvival and growth factors secreted by stem cells.
We found that mAb4 can suppress outgrowth of the
most potent clonogenic cells, those capable of establishing
single cell clones (at 1-5 cells per well). Other stem cells
present at lower frequency can rescue clone development
if sufficient cells are plated in the presence of mAb4.
For example, if the critical stem cell was present at a
frequency of 1 in 500 cells, this absolute number of 500
cells per well would be predicted to produce viable clones
regardless of cell density/volume. However, we found a
consistent inverse cell/volume-dependent growth pattern
observed when identical numbers of cells were plated
in increasing media volumes and surface areas available
for growth in wells (Table 5). These findings suggest that
cell density/volume media is also a determinant of B-cell
survival in the presence of mAb4, along with absolute cell
number, and thus concentrations of an as yet undefined
secreted growth factor may be critical.
In this cell density/volume media experiment
(Table 5), we observed significant differences (p < 0.05)
between the 96-well viable cell counts, the 48-well viable
cell counts and the 24-well viable cell counts, despite
plating the same number of cells (10 or 50 cells per well)
in each experiment, for each cell line tested. The results
are consistent and show that plating the same number
of cells in a smaller volume results in greater outgrowth
or clone formation in mAb4-treated cells, although both
wells are still reduced in viable cell number compared
to isotype-matched control mAb. Thus, while mAb4 still
suppresses cell growth up to 500-1,000 cells per well, its
effect is lessened when cell density is increased (Figure
2I). These data also show significant differences for each
comparator case of same cell number per well vs. well size
and volume. Control wells treated with isotype-matched
mAb, plated at 1-5 cells per well, consistently produced
clones with these cell lines. This experiment was expanded
to include different mAb dilution experiments examining
concentrations from 1 µg/ml to 20 µg/ml. The inhibition
of growth of the mIgM-expressing B-cell line, CRL 1648,
by mAb4 over ten days was tested at cell dilutions of 20,
100, 250, 500, and 1,000 cells/well. As shown in Figure

Limiting dilution assays of CRL 1648 cells,
growing with or without 1 μg/ml of mAb4, demonstrated
significant growth inhibitory effects and decrease in cell
survival in 10-day culture experiments (Table 5, Figure 2).
Marked inhibition of growth was observed in wells plated
with 20-1,000 cells per well (20 vs. 500 vs. 1,000 cells/
well). mAb4-treated wells did not achieve positive MTT
signals, even when pooled, and remained at background
level for the 10-day observation period. mAb4 depletion
from solution by adsorption with fresh human CLLs
resulted in a lack of detectable binding to PDm, the Perfect
FOCUSTM + IA purified fraction in solid-phase ELISA
assays and growth inhibition properties. As cell growth in
control wells achieved minimum cell numbers for positive
MTT readings on days 2-4 of cell culture, the Student’s
t-test was only applicable to time points from days 2 to
day 10, depending on the cell numbers plated and cell
line. Growth curves shown in (Figure 2A, 2D-2I) present
significantly different growth patterns in comparisons of
mAb4 vs. isotype control mAb or comparisons of 1,000
vs. 500 vs. 250 or fewer cells/well.
Evidence of a significant caspase-dependent
apoptotic effect by ELISA was found in residual cells
at day 10 when compared to isotype control mAb (p <
0.05). At earlier time points no statistical caspase signal
was detected (days 4-6). Thus, the major mechanism
responsible for differential viable cell numbers, observed
in days 4-10, was inhibition of single cell clone outgrowth
as observed by phase contrast microscopy, rather than
cell lysis. Caspase-positive wells were only obtained
at days 8-10 (p < 0.05) indicating that apoptosis was a
late event. The ability of stem cells to establish viable
clones in limiting dilution conditions was impaired by
mAb4 (Figure 2A), while mAb1, mAb2, and mAb3 only
induced minor morphological changes and no change in
cell numbers (Figure 2B, demonstrating lack of effect with
mAb1 and mAb3). Changing growth conditions, such as
% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS), or the use of normal human
serum or CLL patient serum added to the complete media,
did not affect mAb4 inhibitory activity (p < 0.05) (data
not shown). Removal of mAb4 at ten days, re-culturing
cells, and re-examining viability and clonability-efficiency
of residual cells revealed no growth of clones, even in the
absence of mAb4 (p < 0.05) (data not shown). Thus growth
of cells after 20 days, ten days with mAb4 followed by ten
without mAb4, yielded no microscopically visible viable
cells or MTT signal.
Because these anti-tumor effects of mAb4 were
observed in experiments testing limiting-dilution clonal
growth conditions, we investigated whether the mechanism
of mAb4 inhibition is consistent with the blocking of a
soluble autocrine or paracrine growth factor, or is directly
dependent on stem cell frequency. These hypotheses may

2I, mAb4 inhibited growth in the mIgM-expressing B-cell
line, CRL 1648, for a 10-day period, but not when the
concentration of cells plated was greater than 500-1,000
cells/well. These anti-clonogenic effects were confirmed
by timed microscopic observations, which demonstrated
that it was the inability of single cells to replicate (self
renewal) and establish clones over the first 4-10 days
of culture that was primarily responsible for reduced
cell numbers. As a secondary effect, these mAb4 nonclonogenic cells subsequently became caspase-positive,
undergoing apoptosis by days 8-10.
Similar experiments using control mIgG-expressing
cells did not show any of the mAb4-induced biologic
effects, and anti-PD mAb2, commercial polyclonal rabbit,
mouse, or goat anti-huIgM was not anti-clonogenic with
mIgM+ or mIgG+ cells in this assay, despite previous
evidence that it internalizes the receptor (Figure 2B).
These results suggest that the amino acid sequence
determining functional growth inhibition is located in a
neo-epitope defined by mAb4.
These MTT assays were extended to the cell lines
shown in Figure 2, where a variety of mIgM B-cell lines
were examined for mAb4-induced inhibition of cell
growth and apoptosis. These experiments indicate that
mAb4-induced inhibition was a general phenomenon in
mIgM-expressing cells. mAb4 induced growth inhibition
of mIgM-expressing B-cell lines, including CRL 1648
(Figure 2A), CRL 2958 (Figure 2D), CRL 1596 (Figure

CRL 1647 (Figure 2H).

as well as other growth promoting factors [46-52]. Those
cells undergoing somatic mutation may also exhibit autoreactivity and respond to microenvironment-derived
factors promoting growth in the absence of appropriate
apoptosis [46-52]. For example, bone marrow and lymph
nodes appear to be favorable sites for CLL proliferation
while the blood appears to be less favorable [47, 53,
54]. The more recent observations of a drug-induced
lymphocytosis linked to clinical response may correlate
with increased vulnerability of these cells due to loss of
bone marrow/lymph node environmental pro-survival
factors [46-54]. Investigations into environmental
regulatory factors and the constitutively activated BCRC
state were the basis of the screening and testing of mAb
anti-tumor effects at limiting dilution conditions as a
model to tease out the individual factors that play a role in
cell survival [28, 29, 30]. Results presented here directly
implicate external factors as determinants in cell survival
in mAb4 treated cells (Table 5). This model facilitates
further investigation and identification of the factors
opposing mAb4-induced anti-tumor effects.
The identification of the BCRC as the initiating
oncogenic stimulus is strikingly similar to the biology of
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), which is a model
of an initial “one translocation event” mutation generating
the single protein driver of malignancy [55]. Rational drug
design targeting the translocation-induced constitutively
activated TK in CML has lead to a marked improvement
in clinical outcomes [55]. This example emphasizes
the advantages of identifying the molecular structure
initiating and maintaining the malignant phenotype. The
continued growth-promoting stimulation by the activated
BCRC would be expected to select for an accumulation of
mutation variant clones in the downstream TK pathways,
despite initial good clinical response to downstream TKI
[16-18]. These finding suggest that anti-BCRC therapy
may have maximum clinical benefit if administered early
in the course of disease to suppress BCRC downstream
stimulation, cell division, and mutational events, and
thus control the disease in the chronic phase as has been
demonstrated in CML therapy [55]. Early therapeutic
intervention may, in general, be critical to achieve
more robust outcomes. mAbs presented here provide an
opportunity for direct targeting of the BCRC, the initiating
factor in almost all B-cell malignancies.
“Chronic Active BCRC Signaling” has been
identified in the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of
DLBCL. The BCRC was found to be present in microclusters on the cell membrane, driving cell growth [2427]. The current SEM investigations reveal similar but
smaller complexes of mIgM clusters present to variable
degrees in all the B-cell lines tested in our panel (Figure
1G). This finding may suggest a more universal role
for small mIgM clusters (“small micro-clusters”) as a
mechanism for signal amplification and as a potential
marker of prognosis [26]. As the SEM experiments

DISCUSSION
For B-cell leukemia and lymphoma, an abundance
of evidence supports the contention that the BCRC itself
drives the malignant phenotype [13, 32-37]. The concept
that either an antigen encounter or persistent receptor
stimulation is the basis for the constitutively activated
BCRC state is supported by the finding that CLL cell
immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IgVH)
genes are often derived from a restricted repertoire [12,
38-44]. As naïve B-cells encounter antigens in germinal
centers, and the IgVH mutation-based maturation process
is initiated, two distinct early B-cell subtypes emerge as
progenitors of CLL. In one case, the malignant B-cell
does not enter the somatic mutation phase [38, 43]. Unmutated IgVH cells have phenotypes consistent with
weak poly-auto-reactive targets, including a subset
that is self-reactive to the BCRC [38, 43, 44]. In an
environment of continuous stimulation of the BCRC and
maximum BCRC-dependent signaling, patients are noted
to have poor outcomes compared to the progenitor B-cells
undergoing somatic IgVH mutations [44, 45].
In addition to these BCRC events, there is clear
evidence that environmental factors play a critical role
in providing different levels of co-antigenic stimulation,

represent results of glutaraldehyde-fixed cells, the
clustered formations were not induced by mAb, but rather
detected by our mAb panel. The mIgM cluster shown in
Figure 1G may not be identical to those described for the
ABC subtype of DLBCL, but may be functionally active.
SEM investigations of mAb binding to DLBCL (not
shown) demonstrated more intense gold clustering which
may represent the classical micro-cluster, but further
investigation is needed to classify these entities by size
and function. As mAb4 induced growth inhibition, even
in B-cell lines demonstrating increased clustering, this
molecular event does not appear to confer resistance to
mAb4 (Figure 2) nor does the clustering itself block the
mAb4-binding epitope (Figure 1A-1C).
The depiction of the “mIgM-signalasome” has
often been simplified, and betrays the complexity
and redundancy that is known to be wired into B-cell
activation, especially pathways from the stromal microenvironment [46-54], pathways across the membrane
surface [56, 57] and by interactions with numerous
cytoplasmic mediators [4,6,58-62]. Taken together,
investigations presented here, regarding the robust and
specific biologic effects mediated by mAb4, demonstrate
that the BCRC remains the central controlling element
of oncogenesis (Figure 2). Cell membrane-associated
proteins contribute to BCRC-dependent downstream
signaling. For example, CD19 is a B-cell trans-membrane
molecule that associates with the BCRC and is critical for
B-cell activation [57]. Additionally, BCRC signaling is
modulated by a net balance of CD19 and CD22 effects
[63]. While CD19 is thought to amplify the signal
generated through the BCRC, CD22 acts as an inhibitor
[64-71]. These examples demonstrate how multiple
extracellular and trans-membrane signaling pathways
fine-tune the BCRC control of B-cell kinetics and the
malignant phenotype.
A therapeutic strategy of BCRC cross-linking and
internalization might be expected to disrupt or eliminate
BCRC-dependent signal transduction. However,
experimental evidence suggests that this is not the
case and internalized BCRC continues to regulate cell
processes [15]. Data presented here confirm these reports
and demonstrate that the epitope directing cross-linking
is critical in determining post receptor internalization
events (Figure 2A vs. 2B). Anti-PD mAbs induce a state
where cell surface mIg is no longer detected (by SEM
using an anti-huIgM reagent). However, in this BCRC cell
surface expression-negative state, no growth-inhibition
effects are measured. While in contrast, the mAb4induced BCRC negative phenotype results in growth
inhibition and apoptosis (Figure 1I, Figure 2). Similarly,
CD79α/β is critical in mIgM-directed signal transduction
and is co-internalized with mIgM by anti-PD mAbs but
continues to signal in its internalized state [15]. AntiCD79 Abs have also been evaluated for internalizing
capability, and growth-inhibitory effects. One antiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CD79α/β mAb, being developed as a “carrier mAb” to
deliver cytotoxics to lymphoma cells, inhibits growth of
B-cells [72]. In addition to the IgVH mutation prognostic
status association, strong negative prognoses correlate to
cytogenetic findings such as del 17p, associated with p53functional impairment. Patients with tumors exhibiting
p53 abnormalities have rapid disease growth and poor
survival [73]. While this abnormality is believed to be
remote from the BCRC and its immediate pathways, it is
now well established that inhibition of Bruton’s TK in the
clinic reverses the rapid growth of these tumors, mediates
response, and reduces the poor prognosis implications
[73]. These findings further confirm the dominant role
of inhibition of BCRC activation over distal regulatory
cellular processes and survival outcomes. In the absence
of growth stimulation induced by the BCRC, p53 antiapoptotic abnormalities become less critical.
As progress has been made in selecting molecular
targets for therapy, the therapeutic modalities themselves
have evolved and have become more potent. New
anti-CD20 Abs show increased efficiency of effector
mechanisms of cytotoxicity. Engineered T-cell directed
therapies, such as bi-specific [74] or T-cell chimeric
antigen receptors [75], have demonstrated robust and
specific targeted-restricted cytotoxicity, resulting in an
almost surgical-precision resection of antigen-expressing
tissue. However, the discovery of more tumor-specific
targets has lagged in comparison to the increased potency
of the cytotoxic mechanism, resulting in prospects of vast
numbers of patients suffering with severe or complete
B-cell depletion. The mAbs generated here offer a better
focused targeting system more applicable to these potent
drug or T-cell directed therapeutic modalities [74, 75].
Extensive specificity studies were conducted, which
demonstrated the lack of epitope expression in epithelial
or other lymphatic tissues and lack of cross-reactivities
of these mAbs to unrelated proteins (Table 1A-E). Data
regarding the specificity of mIgM receptor targeting and
internalization kinetics suggest that all four mAbs could
reduce normal tissue toxicity when compared to currently
utilized “mAb targeting agents”.
Here we show the internalizing kinetics of the
mAbs, the identity of the mAbs reactivity with anti-huIgM
sera and the completeness of mIgM internalization by each
mAb (Table 2, 3, Figure 1A vs. 1I). Results of the SEM,
protein G-RBCs, and cell adsorption timed experiments
demonstrate that increasing times of mAb4 exposure (30
minutes at 37 °C) specifically reduced the amount of cell
surface mIgM to undetectable levels. Thus, with these
mAbs, salvaging IgG- and IgA-expressing B-cells may
be feasible, which would reduce the immune-suppression
common with current treatments (Figure 2A vs. 2C).
In addition, an understanding of the spatial binding
characteristics and epitope definition of each of the mAbs
is critical in determining structural-functional relationships
of their defined epitopes in macromolecules, and whether
74714

any of these epitopes have natural regulatory-ligands.
The identification of biologically active epitopes may
help detect and characterize possible natural binding
regulatory ligands by affinity chromatography. For
clinical utility, determining whether multiple mAbs
can bind simultaneously to the target protein and what
biological effects each may induce, will contribute to
rational drug development. For example, if three mAbs
from our panel each bind to different epitopes, and do not
interfere quantitatively with each others’ binding, then the
amount of drug-bound-mAb delivered to the cell could
increase substantially by using combinations of mAbs or
even combinations of synergistic drug conjugates. Thus,
further clinical studies will reveal the utility of the mAb
panel presented here in targeted leukemia and lymphoma
therapies.

mice, six mice per group, were immunized comprising
20 distinct immunization strategies of adjuvants,
immunogens, and murine genetic backgrounds. Clones of
interest were labeled according to fusion number, clone
number, and immunization strategy.
Pre- and post-mouse-immunization serum
was collected, diluted 1:100, and tested for peptidespecific activity in ELISA (Promega) to select mice
for fusions [77]. Initial low titer sera and low peptide
immunogenicity was observed and this finding was
consistent with failed previous efforts to produce high
affinity anti-PDm and anti-PDg mAbs. In contrast, this
genetic background is appropriate to produce anti-mIgE
mAbs [21, 78, 79]. Testing hybridoma supernatants also
confirmed that when mAb was purified and adjusted for
concentration, the mAbs were weak binders in ELISA
assays. Screening assays were then designed to exclude
low affinity mAbs. Selected mAbs were purified from
hybridoma supernatants, utilizing rapid micro-protein A
chromatography purification (Thermo-Fisher Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and tested in protein concentrationdependent dilution ELISA assays [77]. New strategies,
including extending the peptides into the µC4 domain
4 region (“extended peptide” 18mer (Bio-Synthesis)) to
possibly capture conformational epitopes, using highly
purified target protein for boosts, and testing a variety
of mouse strains and new adjuvants, resulted in six mice
with post immunization serum (1:100) titers of >1:10,000.
These mice were selected for hybridoma generation and
three clones were isolated that were active in binding
to the eight target constructs, maintaining good ELISA
reactivity in dilutional assays ( < 10 ng/ml). Two clones
were specific for mIgG and PDg.
Purified mIgM enrichment for immunization and
screening: Upon generation and isolation of our first antiPD mAb (mAb1) and completion of initial specificity
testing, mAb1 was incorporated into immune-affinity
chromatography (AminoLink™ Plus Immobilization Kit,
2 ml; Thermo-Fisher Scientific; Pierce Inc., Rockford, IL,
USA) to enrich cell lysates for native mIgM. Patient FicollPaque Plus (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway,
NJ, USA) purified CLL cells or cell lines (CRL 1648)
were used as a source for native mIgM in 0.05% NP40 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and PerfectFOCUSTM - membrane protein extraction technology
(G Biosciences, St. Louis, MO, USA; Pierce Inc.) cell
extract fractions were used for assays and further mouse
immunizations. Perfect-FOCUSTM - membrane protein
extraction technology removed ionic detergents, charged
molecules, and cytoplasmic proteins by precipitating
membrane proteins, which were subsequently collected
by centrifugation (G Biosciences). The protein pellet was
solubilized in immunogen buffer or pH 8.6 Tris 0.5N
NaCl buffer for further mIgM purification by immune
chromatography or applications as native mIgM for
immunization. In these later immunizations, sets of mice

PDm or PDg (Bio-Synthesis, Lewisville, TX, USA)
and Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) PDm or PDg
(Bio-Synthesis). GST, MAP, and KLH constructs were
used as immunogenic covalently bound carrier proteins
and sets of mice (six mice per set) were immunized with
one protein, or combinations of the proteins carrying
the target peptide. Due to relative hydrophobicity
of the PDm peptide, both n-terminal and c-terminal
KLH peptides were generated (Bio-Synthesis) for
immunizations and for screening hybridoma supernatants.

for immunizations and for screening clones. The common
overlapping sequences of PDe and PDd were also
tested in screenings to further establish specificity (BioSynthesis). These multiple constructs, and the available
free GST, MAP, and KLH, allowed for rapid screening
and elimination of hybridoma clones reactive with carrier

mIgM to capture conformational epitopes.
The mIgM/mIgG molecules were proven to be
expressed by the selected lymphoma cell line panel using
RNA primers specific for PDm and PDg by RT-PCR, and
were shown to be present in the cell membrane fraction by
Western blot analysis [22]. PDd was tested by RT-PCR in
select cell lines used for immunization and was found to
be expressed in all lines tested. PDd, PDa, and PDg, and
the common overlapping sequence of PDe, were generated
and tested for mAb reactivity because purified CLL cell
lysate fractions likely contained these PD constructs as
contaminants (eg PDd). The mIgM and mIgG fractions
were collected by Perfect-FOCUS™ - membrane protein

These assays were used to further demonstrate specificity
and consistency of mAb reactivity to antigen, and lack of
cross-reactivity.
Specificity screening: Using the above screening
methodology, candidate mAbs were collected for further
analysis. Comparative binding of purified mAb1, mAb2,
and mAb3 demonstrated the highest specific ELISA
signal of the anti-PDm mAbs when tested against each
of the eight constructs in ELISA assays and the lysates
from the mIgM-expressing cells listed in the previous
section. Clones with lower anti-PDm reactivity in the
ELISA assays were then tested against the purified
Perfect-FocusTM Immune Affinity Chromatography mIgM
fraction (mAb1). One mAb, designated mAb4, showed
enhanced reactivity with the purified fraction compared to
the anti-PDm ELISA assay. To confirm mIgM specificity,
these clones were tested against viable B-cell lines in HA
[34], in SEM against +/- glutaraldehyde-fixed B-cells, and
against purified sIgM (Promega) in ELISA assays.

Further, these mAbs (mAb2, mAb3 and mAb4) were

Ensuring the specificity of commercial regents

Ab-coated target cells cross-linked by protein G-RBCs.
HA was scored as the number of un-reacted target cells
(non-RBC rosetting cells) per un-reacted control assay
target cells. This assay rapidly assesses if >99% of target
cells are rosetted (hemeagglutination), and thus evaluates,
on a single-cell basis, heterogeneity of mIgM expression.
The protein G-RBC also weakly detected IgG-expressing
B-cells without the addition of mAb, indicating its binding
to surface-expressed mIgG. However, this binding was
blocked by pre-incubation of protein G-RBCs with control
IgG2a (mAbA33), which specifically blocked rosetting
HA using protein G-RBCs, demonstrating the specific
reactivity of the protein G-RBCs for cell surface Ig.
Percent rosetted target cells = (control mAb tested cell unrosetted - positive mAb tested cell un-rosetted) / control
mAb tested cell un-rosetted X 100%. HA assays were
scored using phase contrast microscopy (100x) as neg ( <
1%), + (>1%), ++ (>90%), or +++ (>99%).

As these ELISA assays depend on the ability
to detect a mouse Ig binding to a human mIgM,
highly specific reagents are required. These assays
comprise a set of target Ig proteins that are expressed
in low concentrations and the detecting reagents are
immunologically closely related Ig molecules of various
species, thus cross-reactivity was a major obstacle and
assay development was a critical aspect of specificity
assessment. The ELISA assays were designed to enhance
sensitivity for detection of mIgM by using a goat antihuIgM capture antiserum bound to the solid phase.
This methodology promotes the binding of both human
cytoplasmic IgM (cIgM) and mIgM, which is present
in low concentrations in NP-40 cell lysates. Increasing
the total IgM binding capacity to solid phase resulted in
enhanced assay sensitivity by increasing both cIgM and
mIgM binding to plates (p < 0.05). To reduce non-specific
background, the goat anti-huIgM capture serum needed to
be pre-adsorbed with sepharose bound-mouse Ig.
The detection system consisted of a goat antimouse-Ig-HRP labeled reagent, pre-adsorbed with
sepharose-bound huIgM and determined in separate assays
not to be reactive with human mIgM or sIgM. However,
the adsorbed goat anti-mouse Ig-HRP did detect mouse
IgM mAb in hybridoma supernatant. When a mouse
hybridoma IgM was present, it was found bound nonspecifically to the solid phase as the pre-adsorbed goat
anti-huIgM capture anti-serum also detected and bound
mouse hybridoma IgM, rendering all IgM-producing
mouse hybridoma clones as false positives in the screen.
Thus, rather than continue with further adsorptions
of reagents, an additional ELISA assay using protein
G-HRP detection reagent was also tested as a control,
as hybridoma IgM, sIgM, cIgM, and mIgM were not
detected in this protein G-HRP assay. While the protein
G-HRP assays removed positive and false positive IgMsecreting hybridoma results, the more sensitive goat antimouse Ig reagent allowed better detection of all mouse Ig
subclasses. However, the protein G-HRP reagent required
the capture reagent to be a F(ab)2 product to avoid protein
G binding to capture reagent.

ELISA sandwich assay of cell lysates
Of note is that all lymphoma cell lines used contain
cytoplasmic IgM (variously glycosylated, but similar to
serum IgM). Thus, these assays based on cell extracts
neither confirm nor assess mAb specificity and are unable
to distinguish mAb-specific reactivity between mIgM and
serum or cytoplasmic IgM. Thus, cell membrane IgM
binding specificity was determined by cell surface binding
experiments utilizing viable cells. Protein labeling kits for
HRP (Sigma-Aldrich; Pierce Chemicals) were used to
directly label purified mAb for use in a solid phase ELISA
assay, as per manufacturer’s directions.
To test mAb/supernatant reactivity to extracts
of CRL 1648-mIgM and CRL 2289-mIgG, a specific
“murine Ig-adsorbed” goat F(ab’)2 anti-human IgMFc
or anti-IgGFc anti-sera capture Ab was attached to solid
phase plastic in 0.5 M Tris 0.15 M NaCl pH 8.0, Nunc
MaxiSorp® flat-bottom 96 well plate (eBioscience, San
Diego, CA, USA). The NP-40 lysate of CRL 1648 or CRL
2289, or the control breast cancer cell lysate, BT-474, was
added to the wells. The CRL 1648 lysate provided human
mIgM, and CRL 2289 lysate provided mIgG to bind the
capture Ab. The wells were then washed three times.
As BT-474 breast cancer cell line lysate did not provide
protein binding to capture Ab, this was used as a control to
test for cross-reaction of the mAb to the capture system, or
cross-reaction of the capture system to the mAb detection
reagents used in the ELISA assay [81,82]. Due to excess
cytoplasmic IgM or IgG contaminating NP-40 extracts of
CRL 1648 or CRL 2289 respectively, additional membrane
protein concentrating strategies, such as Perfect-FOCUSTM
were employed. Application of the Perfect-FOCUSTM
technology Membrane Proteins kit (G-Biosciences) after
NP-40 lysis also reduced the NP-40 concentration in the
enriched antigen fraction. For the majority of assays, CRL
1648 lysis fraction was used unless indicated otherwise

Hemadsorption/Hemagglutinin assays
HA assays were carried out as described previously
[77, 80]. As the HA assay was originally designed to
rapidly assess Ab cell-surface binding to adherent target
cells, the assay was adapted here for use in the generally
non-adherent B-cell panel. Non-adherent or weaklyadherent test cells are first exposed to mAb in eppendorf
tubes, washed, then exposed to protein G-RBCs at 4 °C
and examined under phase contrast microscopy on diluted
feathered glass slides. HA resulted in large complexes of

(Table 1). Once anti-PD mAbs were established, immuneaffinity column chromatography (mAb1) provided further
enriched quantities of mIgM from Perfect-FOCUSTM
fractions (still partially complexed with CD79α/β,
as determined by Western blot analysis), which was
appropriate for in vitro assays and immunizations.
The Perfect-FOCUSTM technology Membrane
Proteins kit (G-Biosciences) was used as directed by the
manufacturer. Cells (2 x 106) were suspended in FOCUS™
Extraction Buffer-V (urea CHAPS buffer) and then lysed
by sonication. Protein samples were treated with UPPAreagents, a proprietary precipitation agent. Protein pellets
were collected by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge tube
and interfering agents were pipetted away with washes in
Orgosol buffer provided with the kit. Precipitated protein
was dissolved in 1 ml Extraction Buffer-V as a stock
solution.
As above, to test the relative reactivity of the panel
of mAbs to extracts of CRL 1648-mIgM and CRL 2289mIgG, a specific murine Ig-adsorbed goat anti-human
IgMFc or anti-IgGFc anti-sera capture Ab was attached
to solid phase plastic, in 0.5 M Tris 0.15N NaCl pH 8.0
(eBioscience). The NP-40 lysate/Perfect-FOCUSTM
fraction of CRL 1648 or CRL 2289, control human serum
lysate, or control breast cancer cell lysate, BT-474, was
added to the wells. The CRL 1648 lysate provided human
mIgM, and CRL 2289 provided mIgG, to bind the capture
Ab. The wells were then washed three times. Purified mAb
was then added to wells in which specific mAbs had bound
to the captured human mIgM or mIgG, which was in turn
bound by either the capture anti-human IgMFc or IgGFc
(Promega) forming a goat anti-human-IgMFc-mIgM-mAb
complex or goat anti-human-IgGFc-mIgG-mAb complex.
The mouse mAb was then detected with specific goat antimouse Ig, labeled with HRP (preabsorbed with human
IgM-sepharose or human IgG-sepharose). Hybridoma
supernatants were added, and specific mAbs detecting
captured human mIgM or mIgG, which was bound by
the capture anti-human IgMFc or IgGFc, formed a goat
anti-human-IgMFc-mIgM-mAb complex or goat antihuman-IgGFc-mIgG-mAb complex. The mouse mAb is
then detected with specific HRP labeled goat anti-mouse
Ig (preabsorbed with human IgM-sephrose or human IgGsepharose) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Other positive cell
extracts from our B-cell panel yielded similar results.
Specificity of reactivity was further confirmed using
mIgE derived from human B-cell line SK007 (human
B-cell line expressing mIgE without mIgM) by NP-40
lysis of SK007 cells, and was tested with ELISA using
specific goat anti-human IgE capture Ab. To eliminate
the possibility of reactivity with transmembrane or
cytoplasmic domains (KVK), HA assays were carried
out, and fluorescent microscopy (FM), using fluorescent
labeled goat anti-mouse Ig pre-absorbed with CLL cells,
was used to detect mAb bound to fresh viable CLL
cells. Additional assays were carried out with selected
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

hybridomas to assess relative affinity by testing mAb
purified from supernatant added to wells at 0.1 µg/mL and
serially diluted 2X. This allowed for removal of clones
secreting low affinity mAbs. Inhibitory ELISA assays
were carried out by incubation of purified mAb with
inhibitor for 30 mins at 4 °C and centrifuged to remove
complexes prior to addition of mAb to ELISA plates. mAb
concentration was adjusted based on dilutional effects of
the inhibitor to maintain a concentration of mAb at 0.1
µg/ml.

mAb-induced internalization experiments
Using a sensitive alternative methodology, such
as adsorption, to assess relative residual cell surface
mIgM levels at various time points after mAb exposure,
viable B-cell lines were exposed to either glutaraldehyde
(cells fixed as per SEM protocol) or PBS (Table 4). In
glutaraldehyde-fixed cells, no internalization occurs and
cells exposed to mAb4 first do not allow subsequent
mAb4-labeled HRP adsorption as the epitope is already
blocked by mAb4. Thus, testing the adsorbed solution of
mAb4-HRP in ELISA assays after absorption by mAb4coated antigen of glutaraldehyde fixed cells, yields
maximum binding, which is then set as 100% binding
for each cell line (Table 4, Row 1). Groups of viable
(PBS) cells were exposed to 10 µg/ml mAb4 at 4 °C for
5 mins (Table 4, Rows 3 and 4), or at 37 °C for 5 mins
(Table 4, Rows 5 and 6), 15 mins (Table 4, Rows 7 and
8), or 30 mins (Table 4, Rows 9 and 10). At the end of
the incubation periods, cells were washed with cold PBS
pH 7.0 (Table 3, Rows 5, 7, and 9) or 0.5 M acetate 0.5 N
NaCl pH 4.0 solutions (Table 4, Rows 6, 8, and 10) for 10
mins on ice, then washed in pH 7.0 PBS to re-equilibrate
cell pellets to physiologic conditions and fixed with
glutaraldehyde and washed again prior to adsorption [83].

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was carried out as previously
described [22]. Samples were boiled in electrophoresis
sample buffer containing 0.0625 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8),
10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% BME, for 10 mins and
then separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels (mini-protean;
Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) at 100 V until the dye
front reached the bottom, then transferred overnight to
nitrocellulose membranes (47 mA) (Bio-Rad). Membranes
were blocked with a 5% w/v solution of non-fat dry milk
in TPBS for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were then
probed with primary Ab according to the titers provided
by the manufacturer. The blots were washed once with
TPBS and a 1:10,000 dilution of secondary Ab (either
goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase or goat anti-mouse
alkaline Med Oncophosphatase) (Sigma-Aldrich) was
then added. The blots were developed in the alkaline

phosphate substrate, NBT/BCIP (Promega). Ponceau
S (Sigma-Aldrich) blot staining and Coomassie blue
(Sigma-Aldrich) gel staining after transfer allowed for
an assessment of efficiency of the transfer. 0.1 M TRIS,
1% NP-40 substitute (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01% SDS, 1 µg/
mL Aprotinin (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN,
USA), and 0.1 µM PMSF (phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride;
Sigma-Aldrich) was also tested to resolve membrane
proteins. Standard RIPA buffer with Triton X-100, and
sodium-deoxycholate conditions and non-denaturing
conditions were each used to separate hydrophobic
membrane proteins. Boiling in phenol was also tested to
separate membrane proteins.

Student’s t-test was used to assess statistical validity
of ELISA data points. All data points were calculated
from values across 12 wells in each of three experiments
performed.
HA/ELISA cell lysates assays (Table 1): A separate
statistical test is carried out for each mAb compared to
each control shown: isotype control, anti-mIgG mAb11.1,
and anti-huIgM. Values that are bolded are statistically
significant (p < 0.05).
Molecular constructs-immunogens: Statistical
significance is measured for molecular constructimmonogens relative to their respective control for each
target tested, including PD (of m-mIgM or g-mIgG),
mIgM, KLH, MAP, Perfect-FocusTM (Perfect FOCUSTM
cell extract), and IA.
Biological specimens ELISA: Statistical tests were
performed comparing the mAbs to polyclonal anti-huIgM
reagent (Table 1, last column).
Inhibition of direct mAb binding to PerfectFocusTM assay: Statistical significance was calculated
using comparisons of mIgM-PD, KLH-mIgM-PD, and
Perfect-Focus + IA, each in a test of mAb-HRP reactivity
pre-blocked by unlabeled excess mAb (e.g., mAb1-HRP
was blocked by unlabeled mAb1 and similar results were
found for each HRP-labeled mAb by its partner mAb).
Serum tested included Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulenemia
serum (W-Ms) that contained 4.2 g/dL IgM, CLL serum
that contained 22 mg/dL of IgM, and DLBCL Indolent
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (iNHL).

Cell growth/mAb internalization assays
Plates were tested every two days, wells were pooled
for MTT analysis, and relative viable cell number was
determined by MTT assay of each experiment (Promega;
Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) [22]. Relative
MTT optical density was plotted for each time point
for the 12 pooled cell values for each experiment [22].
EnzCheck Caspase-3 assay kit (Life Technologies) was
used to detect apoptosis as per manufacturer’s directions
and pooled well samples were assessed to increase
detection. mAb internalization assays were carried out
as previously described with modifications [83] and cells
were examined by mAb absorption assays and parallel
SEM assays.

SEM

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The SEM studies were prepared to parallel binding
studies, such as the HA, and to investigate internalization
of cell surface mAb. For these studies, fixation with
glutarahdehyde or modified Karnovsky’s fixative, 2%
paraformaldehye/2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer was used to block biologic processes such as
internalization instead of using reduced temperature.
AURION Ultra Small Immunogold (AURION Biosciences
Inc., Yonkers, NY, USA) was used for detection of cell
surface mAb. Carbon-coated, poly-l-lysine-coated glass 13
mm round cover-slips were introduced into 6-well plates
containing the test cell samples. Cells were incubated
with mAb both before and after cell fixation with
glutarahdehyde, which was followed with a serum-free
media rinse. The serum-free media was then pipetted off.
2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer was then
added, followed by PBS (1 mM phosphate buffer, 150 mM
NaCl) 0.1-0.2% AURION BSA-c™ 15 mM NaN3 pH 7.4.
Prior to scanning, ultra small gold (anti-mouse IgGFc) was
added for 3-4 hours and then silver enhanced with an SEEM kit and SE-LM kit as per manufacturer’s directions
(AURION Biosciences Inc.). Images were viewed on a
Zeiss Supra 40 field emission SEM microscope.
