BACKGROUND: Patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy have reported cognitive impairments that may last for years after the
completion of treatment. Working memory-related and long-term memory-related changes in this population are not well understood.
The objective of this study was to demonstrate that cancer-related cognitive impairments are associated with the under recruitment of
brain regions involved in working and recognition memory compared with controls. METHODS: Oncology patients (n 5 15) who were
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and had evidence of cognitive impairment according to neuropsychological testing and self-report
and a group of age-matched, education group-matched, cognitively normal control participants (n 5 14) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed a nonverbal n-back working memory
task and a visual recognition task. RESULTS: On the working memory task, when 1-back and 2-back data were averaged and contrasted with 0-back data, significantly reduced activation was observed in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for oncology
patients versus controls. On the recognition task, oncology patients displayed decreased activity of the left-middle hippocampus
compared with controls. Neuroimaging results were not associated with patient-reported cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased
recruitment of brain regions associated with the encoding of working memory and recognition memory was observed in the oncology patients compared with the control group. These results suggest that there is a reduction in neural functioning postchemotherapy and corroborate patient-reported cognitive difficulties after cancer treatment, although a direct association was not observed.

INTRODUCTION
Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with cancer who receive adjuvant chemotherapy experience cancer-related
cognitive impairments (CRCIs)1 that can have a negative impact on a patient’s daily life.2-4 CRCIs manifest as difficulty
in real-life routines, such as remembering telephone numbers,5 or deficits in laboratory tests, such as working memory6
and learning new information (ie, encoding).7 Neuroimaging studies have revealed decreased activity in the frontal cortex
during working memory tasks8 as well as reduced frontal, temporal, parietal, and cerebellar cortical volume9-11 in these
patients. A recent electroencephalogram (EEG) study has demonstrated that prolonged exposure to chemotherapeutic

agents is associated with decreases in hippocampal neurogenesis and h-band activity, which may lead to deficits in
learning and subsequent retrieval.12 Furthermore, animal
studies suggest a link between chemotherapy-induced cellular damage in the hippocampus and behavioral impairment in visuospatial memory.13
Results from CRCI studies that used neuroimag4,9
ing, neuropsychological tests,14 and patient-report15
are not consistent; many brain regions have been implicated, but there has been high variability from study to
study (for a recent review, see Scherling and Smith4.
There is also substantial variation in the degree to which
these brain differences are related to neuropsychological
test domains or patient-reported cognitive function. In
addition, whereas some findings support the association
between neuroimaging and patient-reported cognitive
function,9,16,17 systematic review of this evidence indicates no clear association across studies.18
The objective of this study was to demonstrate that
patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy experience
CRCIs related to the under recruitment of brain regions
involved in working and recognition memory compared
with controls. In this study, we used all 3 approaches (ie,
neuroimaging, neuropsychological testing, and patientreported cognitive function assessments) to evaluate CRCI.
Because deficits in working memory and learning can have
direct consequences on longer term memory, such as the
deficits involved in recognition, we examined nonverbal
working memory and visuospatial recognition memory
tasks. Recognition memory is the ability to accurately discriminate a novel stimulus from a previously experienced
stimulus,19 and it involves the medial temporal lobe
(MTL).20 It has been demonstrated that damage to the
MTL has an impact on both recognition and working
memory.21 Working memory involves prefrontal and frontal parietal networks.22,23 Therefore, our primary hypothesis was that brain activation during working memory and
recognition tasks would be reduced in oncology patients in
the prefrontal and MTL brain regions compared with
healthy controls. Our secondary hypothesis was that the
reduced activation would be associated with impairments
in neuropsychological test performance and patientreported cognition. Finally, we explored whether there was
an association between task behavior, neuropsychological
test performance, and patient-reported cognitive function.

University Health System. After physician referral from
affiliated outpatient clinics based on patient report of cognitive difficulty, patients were recruited and consented by
research assistants. In total, 185 patients were identified as
having reported cognitive impairments; of those, 77
patients were ineligible, 59 refused to participate, and 49
were consented. A group of healthy control participants
was recruited through flyers and by word of mouth.
Forty-six individuals were identified as potentially eligible
for the control group; of these, 7 individuals were ineligible, 5 refused, and 34 were consented. All consented
participants, including 49 patients and 34 controls, completed neuropsychological tests and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures. Participants were then included
or excluded from the study based on their neuropsychological performance (see Participants, below). Controls
who performed within the normal range were selected to
group-match the patients on demographics and then
underwent the same magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
procedure. In total, 16 patients and 16 controls underwent MRI and were included in the study. Details on the
procedures for participant selection, the neuropsychological test battery, PRO measures, MRI, behavior, image
processing, and statistical analysis are described below.
Participants

Eligibility criteria for patients included a solid, noncentral
nervous system tumor or a hematologic malignancy of
any stage; a physician-rated Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status  224; and the
completion of 3 or more cycles of chemotherapy within
the previous 6 months. Patients and control participants
were excluded if they had premorbid cognitive dysfunction or comorbidities known to be associated with cognitive impairment (such as major depression or generalized
anxiety25). Eligibility criteria for patients included impairment in cognitive domains (1 standard deviation below
the mean score on at least 3 domains or 1.5 standard
deviations below the mean score on at least 1 or more
domains, consistent with International Cognition and
Cancer Task Force recommendations26). Eligibility criteria for control participants included normal performance
on neuropsychological evaluation.
Neuropsychological Tests

Participants completed the following neuropsychological
tests designed to assess memory, executive function, problem solving/reasoning ability, visuospatial/constructional
ability, language, and attention: the Repeatable Battery
for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status

PRO Measures

A battery of PRO and health-related quality-of-life measures was administered to participants to quantify patientreported cognitive problems, overall functional status,
and well being. These included: the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Cognitive Function
Scale version 1 (FACT-Cog v1),28 the FACT-General
(FACT-G),29 the FACT-Fatigue,30 and the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).31 All FACT
questionnaires assessed for difficulties experienced within
the previous 7 days. The FACT-Cog v1 (reliability:
a 5 .9632) assesses patient-reported cognitive impairment,
impact on quality of life, and the extent to which others
notice cognitive deficits,28 with lower scores indicating
worse cognitive function. The FACT-G assesses physical,
social, emotional, and functional well being, with higher
scores indicating better quality of life. The FACT-Fatigue
assesses fatigue, with higher scores indicating less fatigue.
The HADS measures general anxiety and depression,
with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety and
depression. Physician-rated ECOG performance status
also was provided for each patient.

MRI, Behavior, and Image Processing

All participants who were included in the study underwent
MRI on a Siemens 3T Trio scanner (Siemens AG, Munich,
Germany). Functional MRI (fMRI) data were acquired
using a susceptibility-weighted echo-planar imaging
sequence (repetition time [TR] 5 2200 msec, echo time
[TE] 5 20 msec, flip angle 5 80 , matrix 5 64 3 64, resolution 5 3.4375 3 3.4375 3 3 mm3). A T1-weighted
magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE)
image also was acquired (TR 5 2100 msec, TE 5 4.38
msec, flip angle 5 8, matrix 5 256 3 192, resolution 5
0.859 3 0.859 3 1 mm3). During fMRI, participants
performed nonverbal n-back (0-back, 1-back, and 2-back)
visual working memory and recognition tasks adapted
from Ragland et al.33 Stimuli were presented to participants using Cogent 2000 and Cogent graphics software
(available at: http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent_2000.
php; accessed October 2, 2015) running in the MatLab
environment (MathWorks, Natick, Mass).
During the n-back task, we used a blocked design,
with each block lasting 33.75 seconds and repeated 3
times in a pseudorandomized order. Within each block,
39 fractal images were presented sequentially for 500
msec with a 375-msec interstimulus interval. Participants
pressed a button to indicate whether or not the fractal
image on the screen was the same as that shown either 0,
1, or 2 items before (Fig. 1). The n-back task served as an
indirect encoding phase for the subsequent recognition
test. Upon completion of the n-back task, the recognition
test consisted of 20 fractal images from the n-back task

interleaved with 22 new images (foils). Test fractals were
presented 1 at a time in random order for 500 msec. Participants pressed a button to indicate whether or not they
had seen a given fractal in the previous n-back task. Recognition accuracy was calculated as overall mean accuracy
([pHits 1 pCorrectRejections]/2), and recognition sensitivity was computed using d0 (pHits 2 pFalseAlarms) for
each of the 0-back, 1-back, and 2-back conditions.
Preprocessing of fMRI data was performed using
Analysis of Functional NeuroImages (AFNI) software34
and included the following: exclusion of the first 3 volumes in each run, slice-timing and motion correction,
coregistration to the participant’s T1-weighted image,
spatial normalization to the Talairach-Tournoux template
with atlas regions of interest, and resampling to 3.25 mm3
resolution. Data were then spatially smoothed with Gaussian kernel to a resolution of 8 mm full-width at half max,
followed by linear regression with a model hemodynamic
response function and its temporal derivative for each
block and each task. A priori regions of interest (eg, MTL)
were analyzed for the recognition task.

Inc., Chicago, Ill). For recognition memory performance,
a 2 3 2 mixed repeated-measures analysis of variance and
post-hoc t tests were used to test for the main effects of recognition (hits vs misses) and for group and recognition 3
group interactions. Effect sizes for these analyses were
calculated as partial g2. For fMRI data, a whole-brain
analysis was conducted with mixed-effects meta-analysis
(3dMEMA in AFNI) to determine group-level differences
after covarying for scores on the FACT-Fatigue and
HADS. MEMA uses group-level variation and a precision
estimate of the effect of interest from individual participants. For working memory, the n-back data were corrected for multiple comparisons to achieve P < .05 with
an individual voxel threshold at P < .001 and a minimum
cluster size 17 voxels. Each of the 1-back and 2-back
262

conditions was first contrasted with 0-back to examine
between-group differences; however, no significant group
differences were observed. Therefore, we averaged the
1-back and 2-back conditions to contrast with 0-back and
compared across the groups. For recognition, activity corresponding to the correct yes (hits) was contrasted with the
correct no (correct rejections) and compared between
groups.
We tested our secondary hypotheses in brain regions
that demonstrated significant group differences in any of
the comparisons described above by conducting Pearson
correlation analyses between regional blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) activity and neuropsychological test
performance as well as patient-reported cognitive function. For neuropsychological test comparisons, we used

were performed in the patient and control groups separately and were not corrected for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS
Participant Demographics

Originally, 16 oncology patients and 16 controls were
included in this study. Three participants were subsequently removed from analysis, because 1 patient had difficulty understanding directions for the button press, and 2
controls had insufficient trials on the recognition task. In
total, 15 oncology patients and 14 controls were included
in the final analysis reported here. The groups did not differ in terms of age, education, sex, or race (Table 1). The
majority of patients (53.3%) had an ECOG performance
status of 0, 27% had a performance status of 1, and 20%
had a performance status of 2. Diagnoses included breast
cancer (73.3%), colorectal cancer (6.7%), Hodgkin lymphoma (6.7%), leukemia (6.7%), and myeloma (6.7%).
Neuropsychological Tests

In most of the cognitive domains, as expected, patients
scored significantly lower than controls, indicating
impairment (Table 2) (for eligibility criteria, see Participants, above). The groups did not differ in their scores on
the Trails A and B, Stroop Interference, TONI-III, or
Digits Backward instruments.
PRO Measures

On the FACT-Cog v1, patients reported significantly
more perceived cognitive impairments, a greater impact
of cognition on quality of life, and more comments from
others regarding their cognition (Table 3). FACT-Cog v1
total scores indicated lower overall cognitive functioning
among patients compared with controls. Regarding
health-related quality of life, on the FACT-G, patients
reported decreased physical and functional well being but
comparable social and emotional well being compared
with controls. Patients also indicated greater fatigue on

(7%). Overall mean recognition accuracy was statistically
poorer for patients compared with controls.

Recognition Behavior

Recognition fMRI

Behavioral results from the recognition task are displayed
in Table 6 and Figure 4A. We observed a significant main
effect of recognition response (F[1,24] 5 16.48; mean
squared error[MSE] 5 0.07; P < .001; pg2 5 0.41) and a
significant recognition response 3 group interaction
(F[1,24] 5 6.76; MSE 5 0.072; P < .02; pg2 5 0.22). A
post-hoc t test revealed that this interaction was driven by
a significant reduction in the proportion of correct hit
responses from patients (55%) compared with controls

The initial fMRI recognition analysis did not reveal any
significant regional differences between groups after correcting for multiple comparisons. On the basis of a priori
hypotheses that the MTL may be especially susceptible to
chemotherapy neurotoxicity, in the patient group, we performed an exploratory analysis in this region and observed
a small, 5-voxel cluster of decreased activation in the leftmiddle hippocampus (P 5 .01 voxel-wise, uncorrected)
(Fig. 4B).

Correlations Between Task Behavior, Brain
Activation, Neuropsychological Performance,
and PRO Measures

The n-back d0 was normalized to that of the 0-back condition, which was used as pseudofixation for both groups.
For 1-back, d0 performance in patients was positively correlated with WAIS Letter-Number Sequencing (r 5 0.52;
P 5 .048) and WAIS Similarities (r 5 0.55; P 5 .025).
No correlations were observed for the 2-back condition.
For the recognition memory task, positive correlations
were observed in patients between hits and RBANS attention scores (r 5 0.69; P 5 .006), hits and Trial Making B
T-scores (r 5 0.68; P 5 .007) and between hits and
MicroCog time 1 and time 2 standard scores (time 1,
r 5 0.63 [P 5 .015]; time 2, r 5 0.55 [P 5 .044]). All correlations were uncorrected for multiple comparisons. No
correlations were observed in controls between task behavior and any neuropsychological tests. Within the DLPFC,
in which significant group differences were observed on
the n-back task, no significant correlations were observed
between DLPFC BOLD activity and any neuropsychological test or PRO measure for either group.
For controls, MicroCog time 1 was positively correlated with functional well being and FACT-G total scores
and was negatively correlated with HADS depression.
266

RBANS attention was positively correlated with FACTCog comments from others. For patients, numerous
correlations were observed between PRO and neuropsychological measures, as detailed in Table 7. For example,
slower reaction times on the MicroCog tests were associated with more negative comments from others regarding
their cognition. Surprisingly, physical and functional well
being were negatively associated with performance on the
RBANS total index score and the WAIS letter-number
scaled score. Similarly, FACT-G total scores were negatively correlated with several measures of memory and
working memory, and a higher level of self-reported
depression symptoms was correlated with better performance on working memory tasks. None of the correlations
survived multiple comparison correction.
DISCUSSION
The primary finding of this study was that oncology
patients exhibited reduced activation in the DLPFC during a working memory task compared with controls. This
research extends and helps clarify a growing body of literature that links working memory deficits in oncology
patients to aberrant activity in frontal brain regions.16,17
Our results remained unchanged after covarying for
fatigue, depression, and anxiety, suggesting that oncology
Cancer

patients did not recruit the right DLPFC sufficiently to
perform this task. Another finding was that oncology
patients exhibited hypoactivation during visual recognition in the left hippocampus, a brain region involved in
encoding and retrieval in episodic memory and in the
maintenance of learned information. These functional
deficits are consistent with findings in oncology patients
exhibiting reduced gray matter in the frontal and MTL
regions.9 Similarly, studies in human and animal models
have linked a pattern of white matter degradation in frontotemporal circuits to chemotherapy-related cognitive
decline.37
Our secondary hypothesis was that patients would
differ from controls on behavioral correlates of working
memory and visuospatial recognition memory. For the
working memory task, moderate effect sizes indicated that
oncology patients performed worse than controls as task
difficulty increased from 0-back to 2-back (Table 4).
Patients had more missed items in recognition performance, suggesting that oncology patients may have a specific problem encoding and maintaining initially acquired
information. This is plausible considering that the participants viewed the fractals without knowing that they
would later perform a recognition task.
Finally, we explored associations between task
behavior, neuropsychological test performance, and
patient-reported cognitive function. Because of our neuropsychological performance criteria, oncology patients
had impairments measured in executive functioning,
manipulation, attention, and working memory. We
observed positive correlations between recognition hit
rates and RBANS attention scores, Trail Making B scored,
and MicroCog time 1 and time 2 in patients. The effects
of chemotherapy may have been driving the deficits in
both behavior and neuropsychological performance,
resulting in this patient-specific correlation. However,
chemotherapy-related impairments, including cancerrelated symptom burden, may also contribute to these
deficits and will need to be examined in future studies. A
growing number of studies reported associations between
patient-reported cognitive function and activation or connectivity, even in the absence of impaired performance on
neuropsychological tests.10,16,38 However, in the current
study, neuroimaging correlates were not significantly
associated with PRO measures, including patientreported cognitive impairments, fatigue, depression, and
anxiety. This may be because of limitations in study
design, as outlined below.
Limitations of this study included a relatively small
sample size, which likely contributed to the lack of a

correlation between patient-reported cognitive function
and brain activation. Also, we did not assess for preexisting difficulties or account for insomnia, sleep/wake deficits, or alterations in sleep quality, which commonly affect
cancer patients.39,40 The oncology group was not homogenous in terms of cancer type or sex and included a large
proportion of women with breast cancer, which may have
resulted in differences in activation and behavior. Furthermore, our paradigm combined encoding of each new
image into working memory, reorganization, and inhibition, which made the task particularly difficult as the load
increased. Future research should explicitly address differences between encoding and retrieval phases of memory
tasks and should attempt to separate the effects of chemotherapy from cancer by assessing patients before and after
chemotherapy as well as comorbid symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, and emotional distress. We are
currently conducting a more comprehensive study of cognition, brain activation, and brain circuitry in CRCI to
address many of these limitations.
In summary, the current results demonstrate that
CRCI is accompanied by under-recruitment of the
DLPFC and hippocampal regions. Follow-up fMRI
experiments should examine specific brain circuitries to
identify the neural mechanisms, including potential compensatory mechanisms, underlying CRCI.
