BACKGROUND. In previous experimental models, because of its ability to inhibit
the activity of platelet-derived growth factor b receptor, imatinib decreased the
interstitial fluid pressure and improved the delivery and efficacy of anticancer
drugs, including fluorouracil. The objective of this Phase I study was to define
the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of imatinib
in combination with fluorouracil and leucovorin in patients with chemotherapyrefractory gastrointestinal cancer.

METHODS. A 3-patient cohort dose-escalating study design was used. Patients
received leucovorin 200 mg/m2 followed by fluorouracil 2000 mg/m2 as a 24-

escalated from 300 mg daily to 700 mg daily in 100-mg steps.

RESULTS. Thirty patients were enrolled at 5 dose levels. Frequent and dosedependant National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade 1–4 adverse
events with suspected relation to the treatment were anemia (43%), nausea
(33%), fluid retention (27%), elevated serum g-glutamyl-transpeptidase (20%),
and diarrhea. DLTs were severe neutropenia, central fluid retention, and severe
nausea observed in 1 patient each, resulting in an MTD for imatinib of 600 mg
per day. There were no differences in imatinib pharmacokinetics before or during
chemotherapy. A minor response was observed; and signs of clinical activity,
including the resolution of ascites and improvement in performance status, were
noted in some patients.

CONCLUSIONS. The combination of biweekly fluorouracil/leucovorin and imatinib
600 mg daily given in a week-on/week-off schedule was feasible and safe. Nausea
and fluid retention represented the DLTs. Cancer 2007;109:1897–904.  2007

everal mechanisms of resistance to conventional anticancer
drugs have been described.1 One of these mechanisms is
increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), which impairs the transvascular transport of molecules and reduces the tumor uptake of
cytotoxic drugs.2 The etiology of increased IFP in tumors is poorly
understood. However, growing evidence supports the hypothesis
that the transmembrane platelet-derived growth factor b receptor

(PDGFR-b) is involved in the regulation of IFP.3 Pietras and colleagues investigated the effect of imatinib
mesylate, a potent PDGFR-b inhibitor, on the tumor
IFP in animal models and provided experimental evidence that imatinib lowers tumor IFP and improves
the delivery and efficacy of anticancer drugs.4–6
Those authors also demonstrated that imatinib alone
had no effect on tumor cell growth but enhanced the
efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. One of these
agents was fluorouracil (FU), which has been the
mainstay of treatment for almost all types of adenocarcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract for 30 years.
Our clinical Phase I study was based on the rationale provided by these data. The objective of the
study was to evaluate the safety and dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT) of the combination of imatinib and FU
modulated by leucovorin (LV) in patients with refractory pancreatic, bile duct, colorectal, and gastric cancer. An infusional biweekly FU/LV protocol was
chosen, and imatinib was administered during the
week of chemotherapy only.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients with histologically confirmed, measurable
metastatic gastric, pancreatic, colorectal, or bile duct
cancer who were refractory to standard therapy
(defined as having disease progression during or
within 6 weeks of previous chemotherapy documented by 2 subsequent computed tomography [CT]
scans using World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) or for whom no effective therapy existed were eligible for the study. Further criteria were age >18
years; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status 3; sufficient renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function (defined as the following: total bilirubin <1.5 times the upper limit of
normal [ULN], aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels <2.5 times the ULN, creatinine <1.5 times
the ULN, absolute neutrophil count >1.5 3 109/L,
and platelets >100 3 109/L); complete resolution of
all side effects caused by previous treatment; no concurrent, uncontrolled medical illness; and no other
current or previous malignancy within the past 5
years (with the exception basal cell skin cancer or a
cervical carcinoma in situ treated by surgery).
Patients were excluded from the study if they had
brain metastases, inflammatory bowel disease, coronary heart disease, cardiac insufficiency (New York
Heart Association II-IV), known hypersensitivity to
any of the study drugs, or if they were pregnant or
breast-feeding. Women of child-bearing potential
were advised to take adequate precautions to prevent

pregnancy. Participants gave their written informed
consent before they entered the study, which was
approved by the responsible ethics committee. After
a high drop-out rate (patients who did not complete
2 cycles of treatment for reasons other than toxicity)
was observed in the first cohort, the protocol was
amended to include only patients with an ECOG performance status 2.

Treatment
Patients with pancreatic and bile duct cancer
received LV 200 mg/m2 as a 2-hour intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 2 followed by FU 2000 mg/m2 as
a 24-hour continuous infusion on Days 1 and 2 given
at a constant infusion rate of 84 mg/m2 per hour,
combined with imatinib given as a single dose (up to
600 mg) or as a divided dose on Days 4, 3, 2,
1, 1, 2, 3, and 4 of each cycle. Patients with colorectal or gastric cancer received a modified FOLFOX
regimen7,8: oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, followed by LV 200 mg/m2 as a 2-hour
intravenous infusion, followed by FU 2600 g/m2 as a
24-hour continuous infusion on Day 1. Imatinib was
administered on the same schedule that was used for
the FU/LV regimen. Cycles were repeated every 2
weeks until patients developed disease progression
or limiting toxicity. Prophylactic colony-stimulating
factor or erythropoietin administration was not permitted. However, the therapeutic administration of
hematopoietic growth factors was permitted at the
discretion of the investigator.
Dose Escalation and Toxicity Assessment
For the assessment of toxicity, patients were interviewed using a standardized set of questions and
were evaluated by physical examination and laboratory tests, including complete blood count, blood
chemistry, and urine analysis, every week. In addition, electrocardiograms were obtained prior to each
cycle of treatment. Toxicities were graded according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria (NCI-CTC), version 2. DLT was defined as a
hypersensitivity reaction grade 2, any grade 3
nonhematologic toxicity (except alopecia), grade 4
thrombocytopenia, or grade 4 neutropenia that persisted >5 days without the administration of hematopoietic growth factors. Adverse events were
considered dose limiting when they were related at
least possibly to the study treatment and when they
occurred during the first 2 cycles of treatment.
Abnormal laboratory values were considered dose
limiting when, in addition, they were considered
clinically significant by the investigator. A 3-patient
cohort, dose-escalating study design was used. The

Imatinib and FU in GI Cancer/Al-Batran et al.

initial dose of imatinib was 300 mg and was
increased by 100 mg in the next cohort, provided
that all patients in the previous cohort finished their
first 2 cycles (4 weeks) of treatment without experiencing a DLT. In case a patient experienced a DLT, 3
additional patients were enrolled at the same dose
level. If 2 of 6 or 1 of 3 patients at the same dose
level experienced a DLT, then that dose level was
considered a nontolerable toxic dose, and the dose
level of the previous cohort was considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients were considered
evaluable for safety analysis when they had received
at least 1 administration of any of the study drugs,
and patients who did not complete 2 cycles for reasons other than toxicity were replaced. Intrapatient
dose escalation or reduction was not permitted.
Patients were to be treated in mixed cohorts
until the first DLT was observed in a patient who
received the additional oxaliplatin. Thereafter, the
groups were to be separated to define an MTD of
imatinib for each group. However, a minority of trial
patients (5 of 30) had colorectal or gastric cancer,
and no DLTs actually were observed in these
patients. Therefore, our work focuses on the combination of imatinib with FU/LV only. No conclusions
can be drawn concerning the oxaliplatin combination.

Assessment of Response
Responses were classified according to WHO criteria.9 CT scans of target areas were obtained before
the start of the treatment and were repeated every 6
weeks. Responses had to be confirmed by an independent radiologist. The time to progression (TTP)
was measured from the start of treatment until disease progression or death from any cause.

Imatinib Pharmacokinetics
Imatinib pharmacokinetic studies were performed in
patients who received imatinib doses 600 mg daily.
Plasma samples were collected on Day 1 (before
chemotherapy) and Day 2 (during chemotherapy)
before the daily dose and after 0.5 hours, 1 hour, 2
hours, 3 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 10 hours,
12 hours, 24 hours, and 25 hours. Analysis of imatinib and N-desmethyl-imatinib, the main metabolite,
was performed by using high-performance liquid
chromatography.10 Dose-dependent parameters were
calculated by linear interpolation of a 300-mg/m2,
once-daily imatinib dose, assuming 100% imatinib
absorption and 20% metabolization of N-desmethylimatinib.

RESULTS
Patients
Thirty patients were enrolled in 6 treatment cohorts
at 5 dose levels. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Patients with colorectal or gastric
cancer were included in Cohorts 1, 3, and 4. All
patients except those with bile duct cancer had
received at least 1 prior standard chemotherapy regimen in the palliative setting. All patients had documented progression of their disease prior to the
study treatment, and all of those who were treated
previously had chemotherapy-resistant disease, which

was defined as having documented disease progression during or within 6 weeks of previous chemotherapy. All patients were assessable for the safety
analysis, and 25 of 30 patients were assessable for efficacy. Four patients (3 patients in Cohort 1 and 1
patient in Cohort 3) did not complete 2 cycles for
reasons other than toxicity and were replaced.
Twenty-three of 30 patients (76.6%) discontinued the
study treatment because of disease progression, 4
patients (13.3%) discontinued treatment because of
toxicity (related to toxicity in 3 patients and unrelated
to toxicity in 1 patient), and 3 additional patients
(9.7%) withdrew consent for personal reasons.

Safety, Tolerability, and MTD
Patients received a total of 95 complete cycles at 6
dose levels. The mean and median number of cycles
administered was 3.1 and 2, respectively (range, 1–11
cycles). Ten patients (30%) received 3 cycles of
treatment. Three patients discontinued treatment
because of related adverse events that were considered dose limiting and are discussed below. One
additional patient discontinued treatment for a toxicity that was considered unrelated to imatinib (myocardial ischemia). No dose reductions, treatment
interruptions, or delays for toxicity were required
(with the exceptions of the 3 DLTs), and the majority
of patients discontinued treatment for disease progression. Dose levels, number of cycles, DLTs, and
toxic events are presented in Table 2, and the overall
toxicities are presented in Table 3.

or neutropenic fever was observed in only 1 of 30
patients (3.3%). The nonhematologic toxicity profile
generally was moderate, with NCI-CTC grade 1
through 4 nausea representing the leading toxicity
observed in 40% of patients. The second most common toxicity was fluid retention followed by vomiting, which were observed in 26.6% and 20% of
patients, respectively. The main laboratory abnormality observed in the study was the elevation of serum
g-glutamyl-transpeptidase (gGT), which (all grades;
related or not) was observed in 25 of 30 patients
(83.4%). NCI-CTC grade 3 or 4 elevation of serum
gGT was observed in 11 patients (36.7%) and was
considered related to the treatment in 4 patients
(13.3%). A marked increase in the incidence at higher
doses of imatinib was noted for gGT, nausea, diarrhea, edema, and anemia but not for neutropenia, as
shown in Figure 1.
Three patients had adverse events that matched
the protocol definition of DLT. One patient (pancreatic cancer) in cohort 3 (imatinib 500 mg) experienced a severe, unexpected hematologic toxicity

during the first cycle, including NCI-CTC grade 4
leukopenia, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia,
and neutropenic fever, and died 4 weeks after treatment from multiorgan failure despite maximal supportive therapy. Genotyping analysis for the most
common mutation associated with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency (DPYD*2A
exon 14-skipping mutation) was performed in the
patient and was negative. Cohort 3 was extended to
include 3 additional patients. No further DLTs were
observed in the cohort, and no comparable toxicities
were observed in any other patients in the study.
Two additional DLTs were observed in Cohort 5 (imatinib 700 mg). One patient (bile duct cancer) had
grade 4 noncardiac fluid retention, and an additional
patient (pancreatic cancer) had grade 3 nausea.
Based on these dose-limiting events, the dose level
of imatinib 700 mg daily (Cohort 5) was defined as
toxic, and the dose level of imatinib 600 mg daily
(Cohort 4) was defined as the MTD according to the
protocol allegations. Additional patients (Cohort 6)
were enrolled at the MTD level to a total number of
30 patients, as it was planed in the study protocol.

Five patients received the oxaliplatin-based regimen (1 patient received imatinib 300 mg per day,
2 patients received imatinib 500 mg per day, and 2
patients received imatinib 600 mg per day). All
5 patients tolerated the treatment well without DLTs
or any NCI-CTC grade 3 or 4 toxicities that were considered related to the treatment. NCI-CTC grade 1 or
2 toxicities included anemia and leukopenia in 3
patients and 2 patients, respectively. Grade 1 or
2 fluid retention, neutropenia, nausea, and gGT elevation occurred in 1 patient each.

Activity
Five of 17 patients (29.4%) with pancreatic carcinoma, 4 of 8 patients (50%) with bile duct carcinoma, and 1 of 3 patients with colorectal carcinoma
had stable disease as their best response (6-week
assessment). However, most of those responses were
not durable, and the majority of those patients had
disease progression at their second tumor-evaluation
visit (12-week assessment). A remarkable clinical development was observed in 2 of 17 patients with
pancreatic carcinoma and in 2 of 8 patients with bile

duct carcinoma, which may deserve further explanation: Three of those 4 patients had documented,
rapid progression of disease under their previous
treatment and, thus, clearly were resistant to chemotherapy, and 1 patient was previously untreated. One
of the previously treated patients (pancreatic cancer)
had a slight shrinkage of the primary tumor (20%;
minor response), and 2 other patients (bile duct cancer and pancreatic cancer) had stable disease with a
TTP in the study that was longer than the TTP documented with the previous treatment. The 1 previously untreated patient with bile duct cancer had a
prolonged TTP that lasted for 12 months. In addition,
the patients experienced significant relief of cancerrelated symptoms, an improvement in ECOG performance status, and resolution of ascites (in 2
patients).

Pharmacokinetics
Three hundred thirty blood samples from 15 patients
(all of whom received imatinib 600 mg) were analyzed. There were no significant differences in pharmacokinetics between samples that were obtained
before the initiation of chemotherapy and samples
that were obtained during treatment (Table 4), and
no distinctive features were observed in the pharmacokinetics of patients who had a DLT.

DISCUSSION
For this Phase I study, we evaluated the feasibility
and toxicity and determined the optimal dosing of
imatinib as a PDGFR-b inhibitor combined with FU/
LV in patients with different types of gastrointestinal
cancer. We preferred the infusional use over the

bolus use of FU in the study because of its more
favorable hematologic toxicity profile. In addition, we
chose a biweekly infusional schedule that previously
demonstrated feasibility and safety in combination
with additional cytotoxic drugs in patients with colorectal cancer11 to allow the intermittent administration of imatinib and to reduce the likelihood of
cumulative toxicity. The intermittent use of imatinib
also was supported, because no activity of imatinib
as a single agent was anticipated.5
The combination generally was tolerated well,
and most of the toxicities observed were related to
the progression of disease and reflected the complications usually seen in patients with pancreatic or
bile duct cancer at very advanced stages. Three NCICTC grade 3 or 4 events, 1 hematologic and 2 nonhematologic, were dose limiting during the trial. One
patient (3.3%) in Cohort 3 had severe, unexpected
myelotoxicity that was strongly suggestive of fluoropyrimidine intolerance. This pattern of toxicity was
not observed in any other patient, nor was any other
NCI-CTC grade 3 or 4 neutropenia observed during
the study. FU was the agent considered responsible
for the occurrence of this severely toxic case. However, the possibility cannot be excluded that imatinib
may have intensified the effects of FU in that patient;
especially because an exon-14-skipping mutation of
the DPD gene, which accounts for approximately
25% of patients with fluoropyrimidine intolerance,
was not identified. One patient (3.3%) in Cohort 5
developed severe fluid retention, including peripheral
edema, ascites, bilateral pleural effusions, and anasarca, during the treatment. The patient had no history
of cardiac disease or renal insufficiency, and no significant congestive heart failure or thromboembolic events

Imatinib and FU in GI Cancer/Al-Batran et al.

were identified on clinical or radiologic examinations. No tumor cells could be detected in the
patients’ ascites or pleural effusions. On autopsy, no
causal pathologic finding could be detected. Therefore, the event was considered as at least possibly
related to the study treatment. One additional
patient (3.3%) in Cohort 5 suffered from severe nausea that was related to the study treatment and discontinued the study for toxicity. Based on the last 2
DLTs observed in Cohort 5 (fluid retention and nausea), the imatinib 700-mg daily dose level was considered toxic, and the imatinib 600-mg daily dose
level was considered the MTD.
Fluid retention is the most common dose dependent side effect of imatinib therapy and has been
reported in approximately 50% of patients overall.
Imatinib-related edema usually is mild and superficial. However, excessive or central fluid accumulation
(eg, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, pulmonary
edema, ascites, anasarca) have been reported in
approximately 1% to 3% of patients.12 Severe fluid
retention also is a generally recognized, although
rare, complication of conventional cytotoxic therapy,13 although it has not been described typically in
patients receiving FU. A report of a Phase I trial with
CDP860, a specific PDGFR-b inhibitor, in patients
with cancer indicated that the trial was stopped early
because 7 of 8 patients developed adverse events
that were suggestive of fluid accumulation, and 3 of
8 patients developed dramatic ascites and/or pleural
effusions. In that report, it was speculated that
PDGFR-b inhibition may have been the mechanism
of the fluid accumulation caused by the study drug
CDP860, imatinib, or other multi-tyrosine-kinase
inhibitors, such as SU11248. In a recent Phase I trial,
22 men with androgen-independent prostate cancer
were treated with continuous imatinib 600 mg daily
for 30 days plus escalating doses of docetaxel from
30 mg to 45 mg per week. A DLT was observed in 11
of the 22 patients (50%). The main toxicities were fatigue (35%) and nausea (20%), but 1 patient experienced a life-threatening, noncardiogenic pulmonary
edema.
Two patients experienced the complete resolution of their malignant ascites during treatment. This
seems noteworthy, because fluid retention was identified as a frequent adverse event and a DLT in the
study. This may be explained by speculating that the
antitumor effect of the combination on these
patients’ peritoneal disease may have overcome the
adverse effect of inhibiting PDGFR-b in their normal
tissues.
Liver transaminase elevations were a frequent adverse event in our study. The events, in the majority

1903

of patients, were related to the progression of hepatic
metastases. However, in some patients, a relation to
the combination of imatinib and FU/LV could not be
excluded. NCI-CTC grade 3 or 4 elevations in serum
gGT levels with suspected relation to the study medication was observed in 4 of 30 patients (13.3%),
which clearly was higher than the rate reported in
the official drug information for imatinib (<3%). The
incidence of grade 3 or 4 abnormalities in liver function test results in our study also was higher than
that reported for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (approximately 3%14). It is worth noting
that no clinical signs of hepatic dysfunction or failure
were observed in our patients. However, this point
should be considered with caution, because the
treatment duration in the majority of the patients
was comparatively short. Liver toxicity may be an
issue with this combination and should be monitored closely in future studies.
A Phase I trial recently has shown that the use of
continuous imatinib at a dose of 400 mg per day in
combination with gemcitabine or doxorubicin in the
treatment of patients with solid tumors was associated with unacceptable toxicities.15 In contrast, in
our current study, we demonstrated that the combination of imatinib 600 mg daily given in a week-on/
week-off schedule with biweekly FU/LV in patients
with gastrointestinal cancer was feasible and safe,
with nausea and fluid accumulation the DLTs.
Efficacy was a secondary endpoint of the trial.
We observed a minor response; and, in 4 patients,
there was a strong impression that the course of disease or disease-related symptoms was influenced
favorably by the treatment. However, these few signs
of efficacy are very difficult to interpret because of
several aspects, including the small size and heterogeneity of the study population and the fact that
most patients were not treated previously with FU/
LV. Further studies are needed to investigate this
issue.
