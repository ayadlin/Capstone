ABSTRACT
Dietary consumption of genistein, found in soy, has been associated with a
potentially protective role in colorectal cancer (CRC) development and progression.
Herein we demonstrate that genistein will inhibit human CRC cell invasion and
migration, that it does so at non-cytotoxic concentrations and we demonstrate
this in multiple human CRC cell lines. After orthotopic implantation of human CRC
tumors into mice, oral genistein did not inhibit tumor growth, but did inhibit distant
metastasis formation, and was non-toxic to mice. Using a qPCR array, we screened for
genistein-induced changes in gene expression, followed by Western blot confirmation,
demonstrating that genistein downregulated matrix metalloproteinase 2 and FmsRelated Tyrosine Kinase 4 (FLT4; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3). After
demonstrating that genistein suppressed neo-angiogenesis in mouse tumors, we
examined FLT4 expression in primary CRC and adjacent normal colonic tissue from
60 human subjects, demonstrating that increased FLT4 significantly correlates with
increased stage and decreased survival. In summary, we demonstrate for the first
time that genistein inhibits human CRC metastasis at dietary, non-toxic, doses. FLT4
is identified as a marker of metastatic disease, and as a response marker for small
molecule therapeutics that inhibit CRC metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

effective drug that is able to inhibit human CRC metastasis
remains an important goal.
It is widely known that there is a wide variation
in cancer rates from country to country. In particular,
Asians, who have historically consumed a traditional
diet high in soy, have a low incidence of clinical CRC
[3]. However, Asians who immigrate to the United States
and adopt a Western diet have an increased incidence of
CRC [4]. These findings demonstrate that dietary and/
or lifestyle factors influence the incidence of CRC, and
are consistent with the notion that soy consumption
may be in part responsible. Further, there is a large
body of epidemiologic evidence to suggest that diets

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause
of cancer-related death in developed countries [1].
Increased incidence of CRC has also been observed in
developing countries, likely due to associated changes
in diet and environment. The five-year survival rate
exceeds 90% in patients diagnosed with early stage CRC,
while it is less than 20% for those with metastatic CRC
[2]. The development of metastasis is therefore a major
determinant of survival. There are currently no treatments
that selectively inhibit processes that drive metastasis.
Thus, the discovery and development of a safe and

containing high amounts of soy are associated with an
overall low rate of CRC mortality [5-7]. Genistein (4’, 5,
7-trihydroxyisoflavone), which is present in high amounts
in soy products, has been specifically evaluated in many
of these studies, and is thought to represent a key bioactive
component. It is reported that among the adult Chinese
and Japanese populations, the average daily dietary intakes
of genistein is 39 and 47 mg, respectively, whereas for
those consuming a traditional Western diet, average daily
consumption is only 1-2 mg/d [8-10]. As the incidence
rate of CRC is historically much lower in Japan and China
compared to Western countries, one possible explanation
for this, at least in part, is that Asians consume much more
genistein.
Across a variety of experimental models, genistein
has shown anticancer activity, typically in association
with the suppression of cell proliferation and/or induction
of apoptosis [11]. In CRC, previous studies have shown
that genistein can decrease cell proliferation [12], and can
induce G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [13].
Other studies implicate genistein’s role in carcinogenesis
through the epigenetic modulation of DNA, including
DNA promoter methylation and histone modification,
resulting in altered miRNA expression patterns [14].
However, genistein’s effects are concentration dependent,
the majority of these effects are observed in conjunction
with high concentrations of genistein, i.e., mid-to-high
micromolar concentrations, and the plethora of reported
effects has raised concerns about specificity. At lower
concentrations, overlapping with those achieved in the
blood of humans after dietary consumption, genistein
has been shown to inhibit cell motility and metastasis
of human prostate cancer [15, 16]. However, the role of
genistein in other cancers in this regard remains to be
defined. We therefore conducted the current study designed
to determine whether genistein affected human CRC
metastasis. Further, given the complexity of metastasis and
our current inability to successfully therapeutically target
it [16], we sought to use genistein as a probe to analyze the
associated underlying molecular mechanisms.
Metastasis is a complex, multistep process made
up of a cascade of sequential steps involving changes
in cellular invasion, migration, adhesion, movement of
cancer cells through the circulatory system, and their reimplantation within a separate organ located at a distant
site in the body, followed by colonization, tumor growth
and the associated formation of new capillaries. In order
to successfully metastasize, cancer cells must overcome
what have been identified as three major barriers [17, 18].
The first relates to cellular attachment to the extracellular
matrix, and the basement membrane in particular. Cells
must re-program themselves in order to survive when
not stably attached. The second requires an increased
capacity to produce proteases that are able to induce local
degradation of the extracellular matrix. And the third
involves the ability of cancer cells to migrate through
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

such a modified matrix. Increased cell migration, coupled
to increased extracellular matrix degradation, constitute
the major components of the composite process of
cellular invasion. Increased cell invasion is an essential
characteristic of the metastatic phenotype, is absolutely
necessary for cells to successfully traverse the metastatic
cascade, and strategies designed to selectively inhibit
this process are actively being pursued, but remain
elusive. The ability to inhibit initial cell invasion would
in essence prevent the development of the series of events
downstream from it that together lead to metastasis.
Therefore, we began to investigate the effects of genistein
on cell invasion and migration at cellular level, and then
moved on to test CRC metastasis, using in vivo models.
In the current study, we demonstrate for the first time
that genistein inhibits CRC cell invasive and migratory
ability, and that it does so at concentrations that are not
toxic to cancer cells in vitro. Using a clinically relevant
orthotopic implantation murine model, we demonstrate
that genistein inhibits human CRC cell metastasis. Based
upon these positive findings, we went on to use genistein
as a chemical probe to deepen our understanding of
associated regulatory mechanisms. From an upfront
screen, we went on to demonstrate that genistein
suppresses expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2
(MMP2) and of Fms-Related Tyrosine Kinase 4 (FLT4),
and that it does so in cells in vitro and in tumor tissue in
vivo. Focusing upon this newly identified role for FLT4,
we demonstrate that its overexpression in human CRC
tissue is associated with increased stage and early death
from the development of metastatic CRC. We hereby
identify genistein as an inhibitor of human CRC metastasis
and an inhibitor of FLT4 expression. Further, we identify
FLT4 as a potential marker for the development of
metastatic CRC.

RESULTS
Genistein’s effects on CRC cell viability
As induction of cell death can falsely affect
measurement of cell movement, our initial investigations
sought to characterize the concentration of genistein
that was not toxic to cells. We first performed a cell
proliferation assay on HCT116, HT29 and SW620
cells, treated with different concentrations of genistein,
and measured effects upon cell growth each day, for
five days. As shown in Fig. 1A, genistein inhibited cell
growth in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.
At 10 µmol/L, no significant effects were observed until
after 72 hr, and then they were only minor. In contrast,
at 25 and 50 µmol/L, genistein inhibited cell growth at
48hr and decreased it by up to 83% at 5 days. We further
corroborated these effects by performing colony formation

concentrations of genistein, cells were cultured for another
10 days, and colonies counted. As depicted in Fig. 1B, 10
µmol/L genistein did not decrease colony formation, while
both 25 µmol/L and 50 µmol/L genistein significantly
decreased colony formation in a concentration-dependent
manner, and did so in all three cell lines tested.

migration). As indicated above, this concentration has no
impact upon cell viability at 48hr, and even with continued
treatment at 10 µmol/L, no effects are observed for another
48 hr (i.e., at the 96 hr time point), and are even then
only minor. Cell invasion was measured by a matrigel™
transwell invasion assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, genistein
significantly inhibited cell invasion and cell migration in
all three cell lines tested, inhibiting cell invasion by 36%
to 56%, and inhibiting cell migration by 32% to 39%.
We further corroborated these findings in a wound
healing assay and in the Cellomics high content cell
migration system. The wound assay is shown in Fig.
2B, and demonstrates that genistein significantly inhibits
wound closure. With the Cellomics high content system,
we tracked and quantified the movement of individual

cells across a two dimensional surface over a 12-hr period
of time. As can be seen in Fig. 2C, genistein significantly
inhibited the migration of all three cell lines tested, with
statistically significant effects detected as early as 180
min.

Given the central role of cell migration and invasion
in driving metastasis, we hypothesized that genistein
would inhibit human CRC metastasis. We tested this in
an orthotopic implantation model of human CRC cells
in mice. This model closely recapitulates human disease
in that it requires cells to complete all of the steps in the
metastatic cascades, including initial steps, such as neoangiogenesis formation, invasion out of the colon tract,
as well as latter steps involving formation of distant
metastasis. Specifically, in this experiment, small pieces
of tissues from subcutaneous CRC tumors, arising from
subcutaneously implanted cells, were transplanted into the
cecal wall. Three days after orthotopic transplantation, 25

The above findings demonstrate that genistein
can inhibit the migration and invasion of CRC cells
at concentrations below which cell toxicity is seen.

mg/kg/d or 75 mg/kg/d genistein or sesame oil (as control)
was orally administered 5 days a week until the end of the
experiment. After treatment for 5 weeks, primary tumor
size and metastases were measured. Metastases were
quantified by measuring bioluminescence in whole lung
and liver organs immediately after necropsy (Fig. 3A).
As can be seen in Figs. 3B and C, genistein
significantly inhibited metastasis to both lung and liver
in a dose-dependent manner (ANOVA p < 0.001). With
lung, metastases were significantly lower in 25 and 75
mg/kg/d groups, as compared to control (SNK p < 0.05,
respectively). However, the difference between 25 and 75
mg/kg/d groups was not significant (SNK p = 0.226). With
liver, metastases were also significantly lower in 25 and 75
mg/kg/d groups, as compared to control (SNK p < 0.05,
respectively), and metastases in the 75 mg group were
significantly lower than those of the 25 mg group (p <
0.05). We did not find ascites in any of our mice, although
it was reported in other studies that ascites appeared after
orthotopic tumor implantation [19, 20]. The existence of
primary tumors and metastatic loci in lung and liver were
confirmed by H&E staining (Fig. 3D). We also measured
primary tumor weight and size for each mouse. As shown
in Figs. 3E and F, genistein treated groups showed a
tendency toward reduced tumor weight (ANOVA p value
= 0.276) and tumor size (ANOVA p value = 0.354), but
the difference was not significant. Together, these findings
demonstrate that genistein inhibits human CRC metastasis
in a dose-dependent manner.
Our previous study with genistein on mice using
doses at and above current doses, comprehensively
evaluated the systemic side effects of genistein in mice,
failed to find any toxicity [21]. For the current study,
we therefore only measured body weight, in addition to
observing animal behavior. Genistein had no effect upon
behavior, nor upon body weight (Fig. 3G). These findings
indicate that genistein did not exert systemic toxicity in
mice at the given doses.
It is recognized that the propensity to metastasize
increases as tumor mass increases. As we found a tendency
for reduced tumor weight by genistein, this raises the
possibility that the differences in metastasis observed in
the current study might just result from differences in
tumor mass. If this were the case, then tumor mass should
closely correlate with degree of metastasis. We went on
to demonstrate that there was a poor correlation between
tumor mass and metastasis at the individual mouse level
(Fig 3H, I). A weak positive correlation trend was noticed
between tumor weight and lung metastasis (Pearson
R=0.322, 95% CI: 0.020 to 0.570 P=0.038, R2=0.104),
whereas the result for liver was not significant (Pearson
R=0.119, 95% CI: -0.192 to 0.408 P=0.455, R2=0.014).
These findings indicate that the anti-metastatic effect of
genistein results from factors other than primary tumor
growth.

We next examined expression in orthotopic tumor
tissues of the cell proliferation marker, Ki67, and the
angiogenesis marker, CD34, by immunohistochemistry.
Our results showed that although the percentage of Ki67
positive tumor cells showed a decreased trend after
genistein treatments, the decreases were not statistically
significant (one-way ANOVA p value =0.126) (Fig.
4, upper panel). This was in agreement with our above
findings that no significant effect upon tumor weight was
observed. Further, both of these findings are consistent
with our in vitro results, which demonstrate the ability to
achieve anti-motility effects in the absence of cell toxicity.
However, genistein did significantly reduce microvessel
density, as reflected by decreased CD34 staining in tumor
tissues, and it did so in a dose-dependent manner, with
the strongest reduction observed in the 75 mg/kg/d group
(p=<0.000) (Fig. 4, lower panel).

Identification of metastasis-related genes affected
by genistein
Having demonstrated genistein’s ability to inhibit
human CRC metastasis, we next sought to use it as
a chemical probe to better understand the molecular
regulation of CRC metastasis. We approached this by
treating HCT116 cells with/without 50 μmol/L genistein
for 1day, followed by screening for altered gene
expression on an 84-gene human tumor metastasis PCR
array platform. Genes with more than twofold changes
were considered of interest. Based upon this, 8 out of the
84 genes were downregulated, while 4 were upregulated
(Table S1). We then tested these 14 genes by qPCR and
confirmed MMP2 and FLT4 RNA levels were decreased
by genistein (Fig. 5A). Next, we examined the effect
of genistein on MMP2 and FLT4 protein expression in
HCT116, HT29, and SW620 cells by Western blot (Fig.
5B). In all three cell lines tested, genistein decreased the
expression of both MMP2 and FLT4 proteins. To check if
this was the case in vivo, we measured protein expression
in tissue sections from tumors of genistein treated or
control mice by immunohistochemistry. As seen from
Figs. 5C and D, genistein significantly decreased both
MMP2 and FLT4 expression in a dose-dependent manner.
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that genistein
selectively suppresses MMP2 and FLT4 expression, and
that it does so both in vitro and in vivo.

Prognostic role of FLT4 in human CRC

decreases MMP-2 and FLT4 expression coincident

with inhibition of CRC metastasis. MMP-2 has a wellestablished role in regulating cancer cell invasion and
metastasis, in a variety of cancer types (32, 33), including
CRC. Thus, while of clear importance to cancer, and
to invasion and metastasis in particular, its role in this
regard is relatively ubiquitous. Further, its function as an
extracellular proteinase has been particularly difficult to
therapeutically target with any type of selective efficacy.

In contrast, FLT4 is an intracellular kinase, and little is
known about its role in regulating metastasis, and CRC
metastasis in particular. We therefore focused further
investigations on FLT4. We utilized a colon human
tissue array to examine the relationship between FLT4
expression and clinicopathological characteristics. This
array included 60 cases of colon cancer tissues and normal
colon mucosal tissues from the same patient diagnosed

with colon adenocarcinoma. In this manner, we found that
FLT4 expression level was significantly increased in CRC
compared to that in paired non-cancerous tissues (Table
S2). Furthermore, increased FLT4 was found to correlate
with advanced clinical stage and with the presence of
lymph node metastasis, but not with gender and age (Table
1, Fig. 6A). We then went on to analyze the relationship
between FLT4 expression and patient prognosis by the
Kaplan-Meier method (Fig. 6B). Patients with higher
FLT4 expression had a statistically significant worse
prognosis. Specifically, among 60 patients examined,
those exhibiting weak, moderate and strong staining had a
median survival of 76, 49 and 21 months respectively (p
value =0.001). These results demonstrate that increased

it in CRC progression.

inhibit the invasion, migration and metastasis of CRC
cells. Further, we accomplished this with human CRC
cells. Importantly, we demonstrate this function in vitro
at concentrations that are non-toxic to cells. The nontoxic nature of therapy in association with therapeutic
efficacy is further supported by findings in our systemic
murine models. Specifically, we observed anti-metastatic
efficacy in a dose-responsive fashion, while observing
no evidence of systemic toxicity. Further, genistein did
not significantly inhibit tumor growth, nor did it inhibit
cell growth, as assessed by Ki67 expression. These in
vivo findings directly support our in vitro ones, which
demonstrate that anti-motility effects can be induced at
concentrations that do not induce toxic effects. Finally, we
further corroborated the specificity of in vivo findings by
going on to demonstrate that there was a poor correlation
between tumor size and number of metastasis.
It is also of importance to note that antimotility efficacy is observed in vitro at concentrations
that approximate those attainable in the blood with

administration of dietary doses to humans. Further, we
demonstrate anti-metastatic efficacy in a murine model in
which genistein is delivered via the oral route, as it would
be through dietary consumption. Finally, we know from
prior work by us that the doses we administered to mice
provide blood concentrations that directly overlap with
those attained by dietary consumption [22-24]. The clinical
relevance of our findings is further supported by the fact
that efficacy was observed at genistein dosages taken daily
with Eastern-style diet or Western-style diet supplemented
with genistein [10, 24]. As our further analysis of
primary tumor weight with the occurrence of lung or
liver metastasis did not reveal their close correlation,
our findings indicate that inhibition of CRC metastasis
by genistein is not dependent on primary tumor growth.
Together, these findings provide a mechanistic explanation
for the lower incidence of clinical, i.e., metastatic, CRC
observed in high soy consuming populations. Based upon
these findings, it will be important to begin evaluating this
potential mechanism in humans, and to compare findings
in cohorts who consume high soy versus those who do not.
Also, having demonstrated genistein’s therapeutic
efficacy, this led us to use genistein as a chemical probe.
These studies were successful in that we found that
genistein decreased expression of MMP-2 and FLT4. The
finding that genistein decreased MMP-2 expression served
as an important positive control for these studies. This is
because MMP-2 has been widely implicated in cancer cell
invasion and metastasis in a wide array of cancer types,
including CRC (32, 33). Further, genistein has been shown
to decrease MMP-2 expression in human prostate cancer,
coincident with its ability to inhibit human prostate cancer
cell invasion [25, 26].
Our identification that genistein decreased FLT4
expression was considered of particularly high potential
importance by us. FLT4 is also known as vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3), and it has
been implicated in cancer related to its role in increasing
neo-angiogenesis [27]. Previous work on the receptor has
produced variable findings, with some studies identifying
its expression in tumors but failing to find any correlation
between level of expression and clinicopathological
parameters [28], whilst several studies do report a
positive and significant correlation between the level of
FLT4 expression in the tumor and the development of
metastasis and poor prognosis [29, 30]. Our results point
to a significant positive correlation between increased
FLT4 expression and an aggressive tumor phenotype and
resultant poor survival. Specifically, we demonstrated that
elevated FLT4 was associated with lymph-node metastasis,
advanced stage, and with early death from CRC. Our
findings are in agreement with those drawn from the
studies of others involving a larger sample analysis [29,
30]. Furthermore, our findings are in agreement with the
current biological role of the VEGF family of receptors,
inclusive of FLT4, as drivers of neo-angiogenesis, and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

resultant metastasis. Our identification of FLT4 as an
important regulator of cancer metastasis is supported by
the work of others who report that the VEGF-C/FLT-4
axis promotes lung cancer cell migration and invasion
[31]. Taken together, our findings implicate FLT4 in the
regulation of CRC progression to a metastatic phenotype.
It will be important for future studies to investigate the
specific mechanism by which FLT4 acts to stimulate
metastasis. Considering that FLT4 is a protein kinase, it
raises the notion that a FLT4 specific kinase inhibitor may
have significant anti-metastatic potential in CRC. In this
regard, we want to highlight that although genistein is a
known protein kinase inhibitor, it in fact decreased FLT4
expression at the transcript level, resulting in decreased
protein expression. Therefore, it is unlikely that genisteinmediated inhibition of FLT4 kinase activity is relevant.
Of interest, genistein decreased tumor-associated
angiogenesis. There are several potential mechanisms
that may be responsible for this finding. A likely one
involves a direct extension of genistein’s anti-motility
action. In particular, it may be inhibiting endothelial cell
movement. This notion is further supported by the fact
that genistein decreases FLT4 expression. Other potential
mechanisms include modulation of microenvironmental
cytokines, altering epithelial to mesenchymal cell
transition, as well as others. While our findings were the
first to demonstrate that genistein inhibited angiogenesis
in CRC, it has previously been shown to do so in other
cancer types, including bladder and hepatocellular
carcinoma [32, 33]. Importantly, our identification of
genistein-mediated suppression of FLT4 serves to provide
a mechanistic explanation for its antiangiogenic action
across several different tumor types. The process of neoangiogenesis has been recognized as a vital factor for
sustaining tumor growth [34]. Our finding that genistein
effectively suppressed formation of neo-angiogenesis
has significant implications for the therapeutic use of
genistein in humans. Anti-angiogenesis drugs, such as
bevacizumab (anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody), have
already been successfully approved for clinically treating
many malignant tumors, including CRC. Nevertheless,
the side effects associated with bevacizumab is a real
concern clinically [35, 36]. Thus, the identification of
novel antiangiogenic agents with less side effects, such
as genistein, is urgently needed, and should be further
pursued in this regard in future studies.
Altogether, in this study, we demonstrate for the
first time that genistein is able to selectively inhibit
human CRC cell motility and metastasis. We also
demonstrate that genistein exerts such inhibitory effects at
concentrations that approximate those attained with dietary
intake. As such, our findings provide a solid mechanistic
rational for epidemiologic studies which associate soy
consumption with decreased metastasis. We demonstrate
that genistein suppresses MMP2 and FLT4, coincident
with inhibiting cell motility and metastasis. Suppression

of FLT4 is accompanied by inhibition of primary tumor
neo-angiogenesis. Our findings provide a strong rationale
for pursuing the clinical application of genistein to inhibit
CRC metastasis. Moreover, based on our results, MMP2,
FLT4 and CD34 could be used as biomarkers to monitor
genistein efficacy in clinic.

assays, 50,000 cells were pretreated with 10 μmol/L
genistein or DMSO for one day before seeding in media
without FBS into the upper chamber of each transwell,
which was precoated with Matrigel. Media with 20%
FBS was placed in the lower chamber and served as
chemoattractant. Cells were allowed to invade for 24 hr
with/without genistein treatment. After that, noninvasive
cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed
by a cotton swab and cells on the lower surface of the
membrane were fixed and stained with crystal violet.
Invasive cells attached to the lower surface of the filter
were visualized and photographed at 200× magnification
using an Olymus BX51 microscope. Photographs of 3
random fields from 3 replicate wells were recorded, and
the number of cells was counted. For migration assay, all
procedures were the same as in invasion assays except
that 25,000 cells were seeded in each chamber and there
was no Matrigel coated on the membrane of the transwell
chamber.

METHODS
Cells
HCT116, SW620 and HT 29 colon cancer cell lines
were purchased from The Cell Bank of Type Culture
Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai,
China). All cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HCT 116-LUC cells
(stable luciferase expression) were used for orthotopic
transplantation, and were established by lentivirus
infection, followed by puromycin selection.

Wound healing assay

Cell proliferation assay

Cells were pretreated with 10 μmol/L genistein
or DMSO one day before assay. Then, the confluent
monolayer of cells was wounded gently by scratching
with a 200-μL tip along the diameter of the well followed
by PBS rinsing to remove debris. Fresh media, containing
either genistein or DMSO, were then added. For each
well, at least 3 pictures were taken with a microscope at
a magnification of 100× at 3 time points (0, 24, and 48
hrs) after scratching. The degree of wound healing was
represented by the percentage of the non-covered wound
area.

The CCK8 assay kit (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was used to determine
cell viability after genistein treatment. Briefly, cells were
seeded in 96-well plate (1000 cells/well) overnight before
complete medium containing different concentrations (0,
10, 25, and 50 µmol/L) of genistein was added. Then the
cells were cultured for up to 5 days. At the end of each
day, cell viability was measured by adding CCK8 agent
at a 10 µL/100µL medium ratio. Cells were incubated
for 2 hr before recording absorbance at 450nm using a
Varioskan™ Flash Multimode Reader (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, MA, US).

Single cell migration assay
As described previously with modification [39],
cells in log phase were seeded in 96 well plates (5000
cells/well) and incubated at 37°C to allow adhesion.
After treating with 10 μmol/L genistein or DMSO for
one day, cells were rinsed with serum free medium
twice and stained with Hoechst 33342 for 15min at room
temperature (RT). After rinsing, cells were imaged every
45 min over a 12-hr-period using Cellomics ArrayScan®
VTI HCS Reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with an
additional incubator to maintain and image cells at 37°C.
Specifically, the instrument randomly selected 49 evenly
distributed fields in each well and automatically calculated
the average migration distance of each cell. Every group
contained 5 separate wells, i.e., N=5 replicates.

Colony formation assay
The procedures were performed as previously
described by us [37]. Briefly, cells were pretreated with
genistein or DMSO at the indicated dose for 24 hr before
seeding on 6-well plate at a density of 1000 cells per well.
After 10 days culture, the colonies were visualized by
0.3% crystal violet staining for 15 minutes. Excess crystal
violet was removed by rinsing the plate with PBS. The
visible colonies were counted and the colony formation
rate of each group was calculated with the control group
set as 100%.

Transwell assays
Transwell cell invasion and cell migration assays
were used to evaluate both cell migration and invasion,
as previously described by us [38]. Briefly, for invasion

MA, US) at 4°C overnight. Corresponding secondary
antibodies, conjugated to HorseRadish Peroxidase
(DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), were incubated at RT for
30 min. Staining achieved with a DAB kit (Zhongshan
Golden Bridge Biotechnology Company, Beijing, China),
per manufacturer’s instructions. Microvessel density
was determined on CD34 stained slides by counting
five representative fields in each specimen under 200X
magnification, as described [42]. Ki67 expression was
determined as the percentage of positive cells in the
representative areas examined in each specimen, as
described by us [21]. The expression level of MMP2
and FLT4 was calculated by considering the ratio and
intensity of staining [31]. The ratio score was determined
as follows: 1 for <25%, 2 for 26-50%, 3 for 51-75%, 4 for
>75%. And the intensity score was determined as follows:
1 for weak staining, 2 for moderate staining and 3 for a
high level of staining. A final composite score ranging
from 0-12 was calculated by multiplying the ratio score to
the intensity score. The tissue array of human colon cancer
and normal colon tissue was purchased from Xi’an Alena
Biotechnology Company. Tissue arrays were constructed
from tissue that had already been collected from patients
undergoing standard-of-care treatment. Further, all
tissue was de-identified, and no links back to the patient
are available, nor will be attempted. Also, clinical data
associated with each patient was provided by Alena
Biotechnology. Here too, no patient identifier information
is provided, all data has been de-identified, and no links
back to patients are available, nor attempted. For FLT4
staining in the tissue array, the final result was recorded
as negative staining=0 (score 0~2), weak staining=1
(score 3~5), moderate staining=2 (score 6~8) and strong
staining=3 (score 9~12). All tissue was scored by a single
person, and in a blinded fashion.

All the procedures involving animals were reviewed
and protocols were approved by Xijing Hospital Animal
Care and Use Committee. Six-to-eight week old, athymic,
Balb/c mice were obtained from Vital River Laboratories
(Beijing, China). To obtain subcutaneous tumor used for
tissue transplantation, 3×106 HCT116-LUC cells were
subcutaneously injected on each flank and allowed to
form tumors. Two weeks after injection, subcutaneous
tumors were isolated, cut into 2 mm pieces and kept
briefly on ice until orthotopic implantation. For orthotopic
transplantation, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital
before sterilizing. A 2-cm left abdominal ﬂank incision
was made and the cecum was isolated and fixed. A partial
thickness cut in the cecal wall was made by fine needle,
and a tumor piece was sutured into the incision. After
re-inserting the cecum, the abdomen was closed with
single layer suture [40]. Mice were randomly separated
into three groups including, vehicle control (sesame
oil), high-dose genistein (75 mg/kg/d) and low dose
genistein (25 mg/kg/d). Three days after surgery, mice
were weighted, and therapy begun and was administered
daily, 5 days per week (Monday through Friday), for 5
weeks. Throughout the experiment, mice were weighed
weekly. After 5 weeks treatment, mice were injected
intraperitoneally with D-Luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences,
Hopkinton, MA, US), allowed to move about freely for
3 minutes to promote absorption of substrate, were then
anesthetized by isoflourane and underwent whole body
imaging using the IVIS imaging system (Caliper Life
Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, US). As the strong signals from
the orthotopic tumor masked the much weaker metastatic
signals, mice were then immediately necropsied, lung and
liver harvested as whole organs, and their bioluminescence
signals separately captured by IVIS imaging. Organs, and
tumor tissues, were fixed in formalin, paraffin embedded,
sectioned and stained with hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&E),
and used for immunohistochemical analysis, as indicated.
The weight of orthotopic tumor was measured, and its
volume was calculated as 0.52× (width) 2× (length) with
measures taken in two perpendicular dimensions, as
previously described [21].

PCR array
Human Tumor Metastasis PCR Array (APHS028A; Super Array Inc.) provided by Kangcheng Gene
Chip Company (Shanghai, China) was used. Total RNA
was extracted from genistein treated HCT116 cells or
DMSO treated control cells using TRIZOL® reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, US), followed by synthesis
of cDNA using SuperScript. III Reverse Transcriptase,
10mM dNTPs Mix, oligo (dT) 18 (Invitrogen) and
RNase Inhibitor (Epicentre, Madison, WI, US), all per
manufacturer’s protocol. The mixture of cDNA template
and a 2×Super Array PCR master mix was added to
the wells of the PCR Array plate (384-well) containing
the gene-specific primer sets before real-time PCR was
performed. The PCR cycling conditions were as follows:
40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1min, and 72°C for
30s. Five housekeeping genes (ACTB/NM_001101, B2M/
NM_004048, GAPDH/NM_002046, HPRT1/NM_000194
and RPLP0/NM_001002) were used as internal controls.

Immunohistochemical staining
All procedures were performed as previously
described by us [21, 38, 41]. Briefly, formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn-embedded tissues were prepared in 4-μm sections.
After performing dewaxing, rehydration, blocking
endogenous peroxidase activity and antigen retrieval steps,
sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum at RT
for 15 min and incubated with primary antibodies against
MMP2, FLT4, Ki67 and CD34 (Abcam, Cambridge,

Statistical analysis

The ΔCt value of each metastasis-related gene in each
group was calculated. The differential expression of each
gene was measured according to the comparative Ct
method (ΔΔCt) [43], and the fold-change in difference
between the genistein treated and DMSO treated control
groups were compared. A fold-change greater than 2 was
regarded as up-regulation, and a fold-change less than 0.5
as down-regulation.

Results were presented as the mean ± SEM
and analyzed by two-sided Student’s t test or oneway ANOVA for continuous variables, as indicated.
The bioluminescence values reflecting liver and lung
metastasis were transformed to logarithm with base
10 before subjecting to statistical analysis. StudentNewman-Keuls (SNK) or Games-Howell approach was
used to perform two-group comparison after one-way
ANOVA depending on the homogeneity of variances.
To evaluate the association between tumor weight and
metastatic burden, the Spearman correlation coefficient
was used. The relation between FLT4 expression and
clinicopathological parameters was analyzed by Pearson
Chi-square test. The overall survival was calculated
using Kaplan-Meier method. SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, US) was used for statistical analysis.
Statistical significance was considered present for P-values
less than 0.05.

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
Total RNA from the colon cancer cells was
extracted using TRIZOL® reagent (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer’s instructions, and 500 ng
RNA of each sample was subjected to cDNA synthesis
using TaKaRa PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa
Biotechnology, Dalian, China). A Roche Light Cycler
480 PCR machine and SYBR®Premix Ex Taq™ Green
I (TaKaRa) were used for the real-time PCR. The PCR
program consisted of 40 cycles of the following steps:
95°C for 5s and 60°C for 30s. The 18S mRNA was set
as the internal control and the final expression level of
each gene was normalized to the control group. Primer
sequences used in real-time PCR were listed as follows:
FLT4 forward: GCCATGTACAAGTGTGTGGTCTC,
FLT4 reverse: ACTTGTAGCTGTCGGCTTGG; MMP2
forward: CTCATCGCAGATGCCTGGAA, MMP2
reverse: TTCAGGTAATAGGCACCCTTGAAGA; 18S

Protein isolation was performed as described by us
[25]. Briefly, protein samples were prepared using RIPA
lysis buffer (25 mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH7.5, 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% TritonX-100) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche Applied
Science, Mannheim Germany). Proteins were separated
by 12% Sodium dodecyl sulfate–poly-acrylamide gel
electrophoresis and were transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane. After blocking with Tris-buffered saline
containing 5% non-fat milk powder and 0.1% Tween-20
for 1 hr at RT, the membrane was incubated with antiFLT4 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, US),
anti-MMP2 ((Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Delaware, CA,
USA) or anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, US)
at 4°C overnight. Goat anti-mouse secondary antibody
(Boster, Wuhan, Hubei, China) was used to incubate the
membrane for 1h at RT and enhanced chemiluminescence
was then used to visualize protein bands in BIO-RAD
ChemiDoc XRS Imaging system.
