Abstract
BH3 mimetic drugs may be useful to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) but the sensitivity of primary tumor
cells has not been fully evaluated. Here, B-lineage ALL cell
cultures derived from a set of primary tumors were studied with
respect to sensitivity to the BH3 mimetics ABT-263 and ABT199 and to Bcl-2 dependence and function. These ALL cells
each expressed high levels of Bcl-2 and exhibited great sensitivity to ABT-263 and ABT-199, which induced rapid apoptotic
cell death. BH3 proﬁling indicated that the ALL cultures were
Bcl-2 dependent. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed a
multifaceted role for Bcl-2 in binding proapoptotic partners
including Bax, Bak, Bik, and Bim. ABT-263 disrupted Bcl-2:Bim

interaction in cells. Mcl-1 overexpression rendered ALL cells
resistant to ABT-263 and ABT-199, with Mcl-1 assuming the
role of Bcl-2 in binding Bim. Freshly isolated pediatric ALL
blasts also expressed high levels of Bcl-2 and exhibited high
sensitivity to Bcl-2 inhibition by the BH3 mimetic compounds.
Overall, our results showed that primary ALL cultures were
both more sensitive to BH3 mimetics and more uniform in
their response than established ALL cell lines that have been
evaluated previously. Furthermore, the primary cell model
characterized here offers a powerful system for preclinical
testing of novel drugs and drug combinations to treat ALL.

Introduction

To survive in the face of abnormalities such as oncogene
activation or genomic instability that would normally trigger cell
death, cancer cells must acquire multiple antiapoptotic mechanisms (6). Many of the selective blocks in apoptotic signaling in
cancer cells involve Bcl-2 family proteins, including overexpression of antiapoptotic members and/or defects in the activation or
expression of proapoptotic members (7). Indeed, Bcl-2 itself
was ﬁrst recognized as a dysregulated and overexpressed gene
that plays a key role in promoting survival of follicular lymphoma
cells (8).
Importantly, dysregulation of death signaling not only promotes tumorigenesis but also confers resistance to anticancer
drugs (9). It is well established that overexpression of prosurvival
Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 blocks cell death
induced by anticancer drugs, resulting in chemoresistance (5, 7).
On the basis of such observations, BH3 mimetics have been
developed to target and disable prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, as a
means to overcome the mechanisms of apoptosis resistance and
tilt the balance in favor of cell death. ABT-737, and the orally
bioavailable derivative ABT-263, are mimetics based on the
proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bad, which selectively target
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, but do not inhibit Mcl-1 (10–16).
ABT-263 has demonstrated in vitro activity in a wide range of
cancer cell lines, primary leukemia cells, and xenograft models
(10–17). In addition, phase I and II clinical trials conducted for
several types of cancer have shown promising results (13, 14, 18–
20). Because a limitation of ABT-263 is thrombocytopenia due to
Bcl-xL inhibition in circulating platelets, the derivative ABT-199
was recently developed, which is selective for Bcl-2 and exhibits
antitumor activity without signiﬁcant thrombocytopenia (21).
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) affects both adults and
children (22, 23). Because cure rates have begun to plateau, new

Bcl-2 family proteins function as key regulators of intrinsic
apoptosis (reviewed in refs. 1–5). They are divided into three main
classes: multidomain antiapoptotic (or prosurvival) proteins,
which include Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and others; multidomain
proapoptotic proteins, including Bax and Bak; and BH3-only
proapoptotic proteins. The BH3-only proteins are divided further
into activators (Bid and Bim), which can directly bind and activate
Bax and Bak, and sensitizers (Bad, Bik, Hrk, Bmf, Noxa, and
Puma), which bind antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and prevent
them from sequestering proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Upon activation, Bax and Bak form pores in the mitochondrial membrane
for the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c.

Supersensitivity of Primary ALL Cells to BH3 Mimetics

classes of therapeutic agents are needed, but these are difﬁcult to
evaluate systematically in patients especially in the context of
polychemotherapy. Many continuously proliferating ALL cell
lines have been established (24, 25), but after extensive propagation they have likely acquired properties that deviate from the
originating primary cells. This emphasizes the need for preclinical
cell models of ALL that more closely represent the disease.
Recently, conditions were established for the expansion and
long-term culture of primary adult ALL cells using a deﬁned
media that lacked serum and hematopoietic growth factors
(26). This system provides a unique and powerful tool for the
preclinical evaluation of novel therapies for ALL. In the current
study, we examined ABT-263 and ABT-199 sensitivity, and Bcl-2
dependence and function, in several of these ALL cultures as well
as in freshly isolated pediatric ALL blasts. These results demonstrate the utility of these expanded primary cultures for preclinical
studies of ALL, provide mechanistic insight into the determinants
of sensitivity and resistance to BH3 mimetics, and have important
implications for the optimal use of these compounds in adult and
pediatric ALL.

Materials and Methods
Materials, cell extraction, and immunoblotting, caspase-3
assay, and coimmunoprecipiation
See Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell culture
KB3 cells (HeLa subline) were maintained in DMEM, and
RS4;11 and NALM-6 cell lines were maintained in RPMI1640
medium, supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum, 2
mmol/L L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin. ALL cell cultures were maintained in suspension
as described (26) in Iscove Modiﬁed Dulbecco's Medium
(IMDM) containing serum-free supplement (10 mg/mL cholesterol, 6 mg/mL human serum albumin, 0.5 mg/mL amphotericin,
1 mg/mL insulin, 200 mg/mL human apo-transferrin, 50 mmol/L 2mercaptoethanol, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and 50 U/mL penicillin).
Mcl-1–dependent and Bcl-2–dependent leukemia cell lines were
described previously (27). Cells were maintained at 37 C and 5%
CO2. Authentication of the cell lines and ALL cultures was established via short tandem repeat (STR) proﬁling in September 2014
by Genetica DNA Laboratories (LabCorp Speciality Testing
Group). The STR proﬁle of each cell line matched that of reference
proﬁles available in the ATCC database. The primary ALL cell
culture proﬁles did not match any repository cell lines, as
expected, and each proﬁle was unique with respect to the others.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined using MTT as described (28).
Cells (30,000 per well) were seeded in 96-well plates, and either
ABT-263 or ABT-199 was added in a ﬁxed ﬁnal concentration of
0.1% DMSO. After 72 hours, MTT reagent (50 mg/10 mL/well) was
added and incubated overnight at 37 C. The following day, 0.1
mL of 10% SDS in 0.01 mol/L HCl was added, and after overnight
incubation, absorbance readings were taken at 540 nm.
BH3 proﬁling
Whole cell (JC-1) BH3 proﬁling was performed as described
previously (29, 30). Brieﬂy, cells were harvested, washed, and
resuspended in Newmeyer buffer (0.3 mol/L trehalose, 10 mmol/L

Figure 1.
Primary ALL cells express high levels of Bcl-2. Extracts were made from KB3
or RS4;11 cell lines or from the indicated primary ALL cell cultures and
subjected to immunoblotting for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1. GAPDH was used as a
loading control. Right, overexposure (20 duration) of the indicated lanes.

HEPES-KOH pH 7.7, 80 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.1% BSA, and 5 mmol/L succinate). An equal volume of
dye mastermix (4 mmol/L JC-1, 0.2% digitonin, 40 mg/mL oligomycin, 20 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol in Newmeyer buffer) was
then added and after 10 minutes in the dark, aliquots of 30 mL
were added to the wells of a black, clear bottom 96-well plate
containing 30 mL of 20 mmol/L peptide in Newmeyer buffer. The
peptides corresponded to the BH3 domain of different proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins as follows: Bim, MRPEIWIAQELRRIGDEFNA;
Bid, EDIIRNIARHLAQVGDSMDRY; Bad, LWAAQRYGRELRRMSDVEFEGSFKGL; Noxa, AELPPEFAAQLRKIGDKVYC; Puma,
EQWAREIGAQLRRMADDLNA; Bmf, HQAEVQIARKLQLIADQFHRY; and Hrk, WSSAAQLTAARLKALGDELHQ. Fluorescence
was measured at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an
emission wavelength of 590 nm every 5 minutes for 2 hours.
Readings were normalized against that obtained with 10 mmol/L
carbonyl cyanide 4-(triﬂuoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP)
as a positive control for mitochondrial membrane depolarization.
Each condition was conducted in triplicate.
Retroviral transduction
Retroviral transduction to stably overexpress Mcl-1 in primary
ALL cells was performed as described previously (31). Brieﬂy, fulllength human Mcl-1 in pcDNA3.1 vector was cloned into the
bicistronic LZRS vector containing a multiple cloning site followed by an Internal Ribosome Entry Site coupled to a truncated
form of the nerve growth factor receptor (DNGFR) as a marker
gene. The constructs were transfected into the j-NX-A retroviral
packaging cell line using Fugene HD reagent, and positive cells
selected in medium containing 2 mg/mL puromycin. After 24
hours in puromycin-free medium, the supernatant was collected,

Supersensitivity of Primary ALL Cells to BH3 Mimetics

centrifuged to remove cell debris, aliquoted, and quick frozen. For
transduction, 0.5 mL of supernatant was added to the wells of a
24-well plate coated with human ﬁbronectin fragments (CH-296,
Retronectin, TaKaRa Biotec). Plates were centrifuged at 3,000  g
for 20 minutes, supernatant was removed, and 1.5  105 ALL cells
were added per well. After 24 hours, cells were removed and
expanded for 4 weeks in medium containing serum-free supplement. Transduced cells were puriﬁed by magnetic-activated cell
sorting using anti-hNGFR-APC clone ME20.4 and anti-APC
MicroBeads using a LS-column in combination with a QuadroMACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec), and Mcl-1 overexpression
conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry for anti-hNGFR immunoreactivity
and by Mcl-1 immunoblots.

consistent with their strict dependence on Mcl-1 for survival
(Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 28). RS4;11 cells exhibited an IC50
value of 223 nmol/L while an additional B-ALL cell line, NALM-6,
were relatively more resistant with an IC50 value of 839 nmol/L
(Supplementary Fig. S1; Table 1). Strikingly, the primary ALL cell
cultures were uniformly highly sensitive to ABT-263, with IC50
values ranging from 2 to 6 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S1; Table
1). We next tested ABT-199, which is more selective for inhibition
of Bcl-2 than Bcl-xL (21). KB3 cells were unaffected, RS4;11 cells
were sensitive, and NALM-6 were relatively resistant (Supplementary Fig. S2; Table 1). As with ABT-263, the primary ALL cell
cultures were highly sensitive to ABT-199, with IC50 values ranging from 3–22 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S2; Table 1).

Isolation of pediatric ALL blasts
Samples of marrow (10 mL) were obtained from pediatric ALL
patients under a protocol approved by the UAMS Institutional
Review Board. Twenty-ﬁve milliliters of IMDM containing 2%
FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 25
mmol/L Hepes, pH 7.2, was added, and the mixture was pipetted
onto 12 mL of Ficoll-Paque PLUS (1.078 g/mL), which was
centrifuged at 1,000  g for 22 minutes. The cloudy layer of
mononuclear cells containing the blasts was collected, two
volumes of IMDM media added, and the solution centrifuged at
500  g for 10 minutes. The cell pellet was suspended in growth
media (IMDM with serum-free supplement), aliquots were frozen
and stored, and the remainder cultured for experiments the next
day. This procedure yielded highly puriﬁed ALL blast preparations, comprising 98% to 100% of the cells visualized by Giemsa
staining and light microscopy.

Bcl-2 inhibition leads to rapid apoptotic death of ALL cells
To examine the kinetics of cell death, ALL cells were treated with
lethal concentrations of ABT-263 or ABT-199 based on the cell
survival curves (30 nmol/L for primary ALL and 1 mmol/L for
RS4;11 cells) for periods up to 24 hours, and cell extracts subjected
to immunoblotting for PARP, which is cleaved into characteristic
products upon apoptotic cell death. ABT-263 failed to induce
PARP cleavage in KB3 cells as expected, induced complete PARP
cleavage within 8 hours in RS4;11 cells, and also induced rapid
PARP cleavage in the primary ALL cultures (Supplementary Fig.
S3A). Similarly, lethal concentrations of ABT-199 induced rapid
PARP cleavage in RS4;11 cells and in many of the primary ALL
cultures (Supplementary Fig. S3B). For ALL-2, ABT-199 induced
loss of expression of the 116 kDa form of intact PARP without
evidence of the 85 kDa fragment being present, and for ALL-5,
PARP cleavage was largely incomplete. Similar results for ALL-2
and ALL-5 were obtained at a higher ABT-199 concentration of
300 nmol/L (data not shown). To complement these results and
conﬁrm apoptotic death in response to the BH3 mimetics, especially in the ALL cell cultures that displayed anomalies in PARP
cleavage, caspase-3 assays were performed (Supplementary Fig.
S3C). Both ABT-263 and ABT-199 caused rapid caspase-3 activation in the RS4;11 cell line and in all of the primary ALL cultures,
but failed to activate caspase-3 in KB3 cells.

Results
Primary ALL cells express high levels of Bcl-2
We initially selected seven primary adult ALL cell cultures from
a total of 12 available samples, for which long-term proliferation
had been established (26). These were derived from patients 19, 2,
5, 14, 3, 12, and 6 (26). KB3, a HeLa subline, and RS4;11, a human
B-cell ALL cell line, were used as comparative controls. The relative
expression level of the three major prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, Bcl2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, was ﬁrst examined by immunoblotting (Fig.
1). RS4;11 cells and all of the primary ALL cell cultures expressed
high levels of Bcl-2 relative to KB3 cells, with quantitation of band
intensity indicating levels 150- to 200-fold greater, with the
exception of ALL-2, which was about 30-fold greater. In contrast
and despite some variation, the ALL cells expressed levels of Bcl-xL
more similar to, and levels of Mcl-1 lower than KB3 cells.
Primary ALL cells are acutely sensitive to the Bcl-2 inhibitors
ABT-263 and ABT-199
Cell viability assays were conducted after 3-day exposure of
cells to the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-263 (Supplementary Fig.
S1; ref. 10). KB3 cells were refractory to the effects of ABT-263,

Primary ALL cells are dependent on Bcl-2
To determine whether the primary ALL were dependent on
Bcl-2, BH3 proﬁling was employed (29, 30). Peptides derived
from a panel of BH3-only proteins are added to permeabilized
cells, and the pattern of peptides that causes loss of mitochondrial
outer membrane potential identiﬁes which antiapoptotic protein
is responsible for maintaining survival. Loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential is measured by the decay of ﬂuorescence of
JC-1, with FCCP, a protonophore that depolarizes mitochondrial
membranes, as a positive control. Two leukemia cell lines derived
from transgenic mice, dependent on either Mcl-1 or Bcl-2 (27),
were used as controls. With the Mcl-1–dependent cell line, loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential occurred with peptides

Figure 2.
Primary ALL cells are Bcl-2-dependent. Mcl-1–dependent or Bcl-2–dependent leukemia cell lines, RS4;11 cells, or primary ALL cultures, as indicated, were subjected to
whole cell BH3 proﬁling with JC-1 dye, as described in Materials and Methods. The traces shown in the top of each panel represent an average of triplicates,
and are color coded according to the key on the right of each set. The bar graphs in the bottom portion of each panel represent mean  SD (n ¼ 3), normalized to that
of FCCP (100% loss of mitochondrial membrane potential) and are derived from readings obtained at 120 minutes. Note that Noxa and Hrk peptides sometimes
gave ﬂuorescence readings (top) that were slightly greater than DMSO control, and these appear as small negative values in the bar graph representation
in the bottom panels.

corresponding to the BH3 domains of Bim, Bid, Puma, Bmf, and
Noxa, whereas peptides from Bad and Hrk were less effective (Fig.
2). This corresponds to the known binding proﬁle of Mcl-1, which
has poor afﬁnity for Bad and Hrk, and to previously published
BH3 proﬁling data for this cell line (27, 29, 30). With the Bcl-2–
dependent cell line, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
occurred with peptides from the BH3 domains of Bim, Bid, Puma,
Bmf, and Bad, whereas those from Noxa and Hrk were ineffective
(Fig. 2). This corresponds to the known binding proﬁle of Bcl-2,
which has poor afﬁnity for Noxa and Hrk, and to previously
published BH3 proﬁling data for this cell line (27, 29, 30). RS4;11
cells and all of the ALL cell cultures clearly showed the Bcl-2–
dependent proﬁle (Fig. 2), indicating their Bcl-2 dependence and
consistent with their high level of sensitivity to ABT-199.
Bcl-2 sequesters several proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members
We next sought to identify by coimmunoprecipitation which
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins were bound to Bcl-2. RS4;11
cells and the primary ALL cultures expressed, with varying relative
levels, several proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Bak,
Bax, Bid, Bim, and Bik (see lane 1 in Figs. 3A and 4A). Bcl-2 was
ﬁrst immunoprecipitated from RS4;11 cells (Fig. 3A) and efﬁcient
immunoprecipitation was demonstrated as Bcl-2 appeared mainly in the pellet (lane 5) and was depleted from the supernatant
(lane 3), whereas in a mock immunoprecipitation performed in
the absence of antibody, the protein remained in the supernatant
(lane 2) and was absent from the pellet (lane 4). Immunoblotting
for proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins in the precipitated material
showed bands that appeared to correspond to Bak, Bax, several
forms of Bim (Bim-EL, Bim-L, and Bim-S), and Bik, although Bid,
despite being present in the extract, was not detected (Fig. 3A).
Identiﬁcation of Bak, however, was complicated by the presence
of two bands, one at 23 kDa and an additional band, presumably
immunoglobulin light chain (IgG-LC) at around 25 kDa, migrating with a slower mobility (Fig. 3A, lane 5). We reasoned that the
binding of Bak to Bcl-2 in the immunoprecipitate might be
disrupted under mild detergent conditions such as 1% Triton
X-100, whereas IgG-LC and Bcl-2 may remain more ﬁrmly bound

1370 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

to the Protein A/G beads under such conditions. To test this, Bcl-2
was immunoprecipitated from RS4;11 cells, and the washed
beads incubated in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and the
detergent-solubilized eluant subjected to immunoblotting (Fig.
3A, lane 7). Immunoblotting for Bak detected only the band at 23
kDa, indicating that the detergent elution step is useful in positive
identiﬁcation of proteins speciﬁcally bound to Bcl-2. Consistent
with the ability of Triton X-100 to remove more loosely bound
proteins from the beads, Bcl-2 itself was absent from the eluted
material (Fig. 3A, lane 7). Bax was not detected in the detergent
eluant, conﬁrming that the band present in the immunoprecipitate (lane 5, asterisk), which ran slower than authentic Bax, was
likely due to IgG-LC crossreactivity. Strong bands corresponding
to the three forms of Bim as well as Bik were clearly identiﬁed in
the detergent eluant, conﬁrming them as authentic Bcl-2 partners.
Reciprocal immunoprecipitations were performed for further
validation, and Bcl-2 was identiﬁed in immunoprecipitates of
Bim (Fig. 3B) as well as Bik (Fig. 3C) but was not detected in an
immunoprecipitate of Bax (data not shown). Thus in RS4;11 cells,
Bcl-2 binds several proapoptotic partners including Bak, Bim, and
Bik, but does not appear to bind either Bax or Bid. To further verify
the speciﬁcity of these interactions, immunoprecipitation with
b-actin antibody as a negative control was performed. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. S4, when b-actin was immunoprecipitated
from an extract of RS4;11 cells, b-actin was detected, whereas Bak,
Bax, Bid and Bim were not detected. Interestingly, Bcl-2 was
present in the b-actin immunoprecipitate, consistent with several
reports suggesting these proteins interact (32, 33). Thus, Bcl-2
exists in at least two complexes, with proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
and with b-actin.
One of the ALL primary cultures, ALL-19, was chosen for similar
examination of Bcl-2 complexes, and with one exception, similar
results were found. Thus, Bak, Bim, and Bik, but not Bid, were each
positively identiﬁed in Bcl-2 immunocomplexes (Fig. 4A). A band
appearing to correspond to Bax was also present in the Bcl-2
immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4A, lane 5), and its identiﬁcation was
strengthened as the same band was detected in the detergent
eluant (Fig. 4A, lane 7). Reciprocal immunoprecipitations

Supersensitivity of Primary ALL Cells to BH3 Mimetics

conﬁrmed that Bax, Bim, and Bik complexes with Bcl-2 in ALL-19
cells (Fig. 4B–D, respectively). Thus, with the exception of Bax,
which complexes with Bcl-2 in the primary ALL cells but not in the
RS4;11 cell line, the binding partners of Bcl-2 are similar.
ABT-263 displaces Bim from Bcl-2
The sensitivity of ALL cells to ABT-263 is likely based on the
ability of the mimetic to bind directly to Bcl-2 and displace bound
proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. We initially focused on Bim because
it is a key activator BH3-only protein and found associated with
Bcl-2 in ALL cells. To test the effect of ABT-263 on Bim:Bcl-2
interaction, RS4;11 cells were treated with vehicle or 1 mmol/L
ABT-263 for 4 or 6 hours, and whole-cell extracts were prepared,
Bcl-2 immunoprecipitated, and subjected to immunoblot analysis for both Bcl-2 and Bim. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5,
lanes 9–11, while the levels of Bcl-2 in the immunoprecipitate
remained unchanged, the levels of Bim, and most notably Bim-EL,
were reduced following ABT-263 treatment. These results show
that ABT-263 reduces the amount of Bim associated with Bcl-2 in
RS4;11 cells, consistent with the mimetic acting to directly displace Bim from Bim:Bcl-2 complexes.
Mcl-1 overexpression renders ALL cells ABT-263/199 resistant
To further establish that the primary ALL cells are sensitive to
the BH3 mimetics because of their strict dependence on Bcl-2 for
survival, we next determined whether Mcl-1 overexpression
would reverse sensitivity. Thus, human Mcl-1 was expressed via
retroviral transduction in several of the ALL primary cultures,
namely ALL-2, ALL-14, and ALL-19, as described in Materials and
Methods. After FACS sorting for selection of cells with relatively
high Mcl-1 expression, MTT viability assays were conducted.
Results obtained for ALL-2 are presented in Fig. 5. Immunoblotting conﬁrmed overexpression of Mcl-1 in the transduced cells,
while the expression level of Bcl-2 was decreased and that of Bcl-xL

www.aacrjournals.org

was relatively unchanged (Fig. 5A). Cell viability assays showed
that even at the highest concentrations tested of 1 mmol/L, ABT263 reduced viability by only 40% (Fig. 5B) and ABT-199 was
essentially ineffective (Fig. 5C). Thus, in the context of Mcl-1
overexpression, IC50 values in ALL-2 cells were >1 mmol/L for each
compound, compared with low nanomolar values in the absence
of Mcl-1 overexpression. Essentially identical results were
obtained with ALL-14 and ALL-19 cells, which also became highly
resistant to the Bcl-2 antagonists upon Mcl-1 overexpression (data
not shown). Thus, in Bcl-2–dependent ALL cells, Mcl-1 can
compensate and maintain cell survival under conditions where
the normal guardian, Bcl-2, is inhibited.
Mcl-1 may provide antiapoptotic function in the context of Bcl2 inhibition due to its capacity to sequester proapoptotic Bcl-2
proteins normally bound to Bcl-2. To test this, Mcl-1 or Bcl-2 was
immunoprecipitated from parental and Mcl-1–overexpressing
ALL-2 cells, and immunoprecipitates probed for Bim. When
Mcl-1 was immunoprecipitated from parental cells (Fig. 5D, left,
lane 2), bands corresponding to Bim-L and Bim-S were not
detected, whereas when Mcl-1 was immunoprecipitated from
Mcl-1–overexpressing cells, Bim-L and Bim-S were clearly
detected (lane 3; note that the presence of Bim-EL was obscured
by nonspeciﬁc bands). Conversely, when Bcl-2 was immunoprecipitated, the amount of Bim associated with Bcl-2 was diminished in cells overexpressing Mcl-1 (Fig. 5D, right, compare lane 2
with lane 3). These results indicate that when overexpressed, Mcl1 shares or attains Bcl-2's responsibility in sequestering Bim.

indicated that the pediatric ALL cell cultures displayed antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression proﬁles similar to that observed for
the adult ALL cultures, with high levels of Bcl-2, similar levels of
Bcl-xL, and lower levels of Mcl-1, versus KB3 cells (Fig. 6A). Cell
viability assays showed that both samples of the pediatric ALL
blasts were highly sensitive to ABT-263, with IC50 values of 6.2 
0.3 nmol/L and 6.7  0.4 nmol/L (Fig. 6B and C).

Discussion
In this study, a series of adult ALL cell cultures, derived and
expanded from primary cells and representing a unique model of
ALL, were tested for sensitivity to ABT-263 and ABT-199, and
further characterized with respect to Bcl-2 dependence and function. The results show that the ALL cell cultures are highly sensitive
to both BH3 mimetics, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar
range. Our results are consistent with other reports that primary BALL and T-ALL cells are sensitive to BH3 mimetics (16, 17). In
addition to this high degree of sensitivity, we observed a very
narrow range of IC50 values for each of the two compounds,
reﬂecting a striking consistency across all seven cultures examined.
This contrasts with established ALL cell lines that vary over a much
broader range and that are typically far more resistant. For
example, Jayanthan and colleagues (34) found sensitivity to
ABT-737 varied over 1,000-fold, from subnanomolar to submicromolar, for ﬁve ALL cell lines with MLL rearrangement. A 20fold difference in IC50 value for ABT-263 for two B-cell ALL cell

1372 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

lines was reported in one study (35), and in another study four
ALL cell lines varied over a 100-fold range in ABT-263 sensitivity
(17). In addition and aside from ALL, a study of 25 multiple
myeloma cell lines reported IC50 values for ABT-263 ranged from
7 nmol/L to 150 nmol/L (36). In the current work, the B-cell ALL
cell lines RS4;11 and NALM-6 were much more resistant to ABT263 versus the most sensitive ALL culture (Table 1). Interestingly,
RS4;11 cells were much more sensitive to ABT-199 than NALM-6
cells (Table 1), suggesting that NALM-6 may be more dependent
on Bcl-xL than Bcl-2. Importantly, freshly isolated pediatric ALL
blasts exhibited IC50 values for ABT-263 similar to those of the
adult ALL primary cultures. The uniformity of response observed
with the ALL cultures versus the large variation seen with established cell lines has two important implications. First, it supports
the prevailing notion that, over time, cell lines acquire characteristics that may not reﬂect those of the primary cells from which
they were derived. Second, this disparity indicates that primary
ALL cultures are much more sensitive to BH3 mimetics, and more
uniform in their response, than suggested by data generated from
the study of cell lines. In turn, these ﬁndings highlight the utility of
such cultures for preclinical studies of ALL, and add to the growing
body of evidence validating the use of Bcl-2 inhibitors as a
therapeutic strategy for this disease. Preliminary results using
peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors have
indicated that monocytes, T-cells and natural killer cells have IC50
values for ABT-263 of >1 mmol/L, and B-cells have an IC50 value of
80 nmol/L, suggesting that the compound exhibits selective

cytotoxicity toward ALL cells and thus a favorable therapeutic
index.
While antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins exhibit overlapping functions (1–5), different cell types may be dependent on one dominant member. For example, HeLa cells are strictly dependent on
Mcl-1 for survival, whereas HT29 colon carcinoma cells are not
dominantly dependent on one particular antiapoptotic Bcl-2
member (28). The recently developed technique of BH3 proﬁling
has been immensely useful in deﬁning which antiapoptotic
proteins play the primary role in survival (29). Applying this
technique (Fig. 2), we found that RS4;11 cells and the primary ALL
cell cultures exhibited a BH3 proﬁling signature characteristic of
cells dependent on Bcl-2. Interestingly though, the primary cultures were much more sensitive to ABT-263, up to 100-fold, than
RS4;11 cells. Furthermore, ALL-2, which had the lowest relative
expression of Bcl-2 (Fig. 1), was among the most sensitive to ABT263 (Table 1). Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that factors
other than Bcl-2 expression and Bcl-2 dependency play a role in
ABT-263 response. One of the established factors in ABT-263
resistance is Mcl-1 expression (36–39), and we formally demonstrated that overexpressed Mcl-1 conferred ABT-263/199 resistance (Fig. 5). However, endogenous levels of Mcl-1 were similar
for RS4;11 cells and the primary ALL cultures, so this parameter
alone cannot explain the differential response. A recent study has
shed light on determinants of ABT-263 sensitivity (40). It was
found that cells sensitive to ABT-263 expressed high levels of both
Bcl-2 and Bim, and furthermore that a critical function of Bim was
to be available to bind and inhibit Mcl-1. These ﬁndings are
consistent with those reported by others, which have shown a key
role for Bim:Bcl-2 complexes in ABT-263 responsiveness
(37, 41, 42), and furthermore suggest that, in addition to its
established role as an activator, the Bim released from Bim:Bcl-2
complexes by ABT-263 has additional responsibilities as a Mcl-1

www.aacrjournals.org

neutralizer. These and other observations indicate that the relative
occupancy and availability of not only the targeted antiapoptotic
protein, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, but also the nontargeted antiapoptotic
protein, Mcl-1, is critical in dictating the degree of ABT-263
sensitivity. Overall, the data available to date highlight the complex underpinnings of the ABT-263 response.
It is well established that a key role for antiapoptotic Bcl-2
proteins is sequestration and inactivation of proapoptotic Bcl-2
family members. While Bcl-2 potentially can bind many proapoptotic family members, the number and nature of binding
partners in speciﬁc contexts have not been fully explored. Coimmunoprecipitation was used to identify the spectrum of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins bound to Bcl-2, and the results demonstrated the multifaceted role of Bcl-2 in binding several proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (Figs. 3 and 4). Bcl-2 in primary ALL cells was
found in complex with Bak, Bax, Bim, and Bik. Thus, Bcl-2
sequesters members of all three proapoptotic subgroups, namely
effector (Bak, Bax), activator (Bim), and sensitizer (Bik). We
showed that high levels of Mcl-1 can maintain survival of ABT263/199–treated cells and does so, at least in part, by binding Bim.
This further underscores the key roles of Bim:Bcl-2 complexes in
ABT-263 sensitivity and Mcl-1 in ABT-263 resistance.
In addition to their use and success as single agents (12–16),
BH3 mimetics hold much promise as chemosensitizers for new
and conventional cancer drugs. Recent work has shown additive or
synergistic effects of ABT-263 when combined with other anticancer agents. For example, ABT-263 enhanced the actions of etoposide, vincristine, bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, as well as several
drug combination regimens, in vitro and in vivo in several hematologic tumor models (43). In ALL cell lines, ABT-263 was found to
synergize with several different antineoplastic agents including
daunorubicin, bortezomib, apicidin, and the multityrosine inhibitor sunitinib (34). With the development and availability of an

increasing number of novel targeted agents for cancer, including a
broader array of compounds targeting antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
(12–14), there are now many more agents and combinations than
can be systematically studied clinically. In addition, the drug
responsiveness of established cell lines may differ from the primary
cells from which they were derived. Thus, there is an urgent need for
appropriate cancer cell culture models, and advances in preclinical
drug development will increasingly depend on these. The results
presented here indicate that the ALL cell cultures represent a
valuable model system for preclinical testing of novel agents and
drug combinations for ALL.
