ABSTRACT
Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I (TDP1) hydrolyzes the drug-stabilized
3’phospho-tyrosyl bond formed between DNA topoisomerase I (TOPO1) and DNA.
TDP1-mediated hydrolysis uses a nucleophilic histidine (Hisnuc) and a general acid/
base histidine (Hisgab). A Tdp1Hisgab to Arg mutant identified in patients with the
autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease SCAN1 causes stabilization of the
TDP1-DNA intermediate. Based on our previously reported Hisgab-substitutions
inducing yeast toxicity (Gajewski et al. J. Mol. Biol. 415, 741-758, 2012), we propose
that converting TDP1 into a cellular poison by stabilizing the covalent enzyme-DNA
intermediate is a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. Here, we analyzed
the toxic effects of two TDP1 catalytic mutants in HEK293 cells. Expression of human
Tdp1HisnucAla and Tdp1HisgabAsn mutants results in stabilization of the covalent
TDP1-DNA intermediate and induces cytotoxicity. Moreover, these mutants display
reduced in vitro catalytic activity compared to wild type. Co-treatment of Tdp1mutant
with topotecan shows more than additive cytotoxicity. Overall, these results support
the hypothesis that stabilization of the TDP1-DNA covalent intermediate is a potential
anti-cancer therapeutic strategy.

the 3’phospho-hystidyl (TDP1Hisnuc-DNA) linkage,
dissociating TDP1 from the DNA (Figure 1) [2–8].
Besides the DNA repair enzyme TDP1, DNA
topoisomerases (TOPOs; TOPO is used instead of the
official abbreviation “TOP” to emphasize the difference
between the protein names TDP1 and TOP1) that adjust
DNA topology form a transient covalent enzyme-DNA
reaction intermediate (TOPO-cc) during their catalytic cycle
(review in [9–11]). However, this transient covalent enzymeDNA intermediate can potentially result in toxic DNA
lesions. This paradigm is extensively exploited by cancerchemotherapeutics that induce toxicity via stabilization of
the enzyme-DNA intermediate, e.g. etoposide for TOPO2
and camptothecin (CPT) for TOPO1, including FDAapproved CPT analogs topotecan and irinotecan [12, 13].
Most enzymes that form a covalent-phosphoryl
reaction intermediate with a DNA-end are potential

INTRODUCTION
Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I (TDP1)
hydrolyzes 3’phospho-adducts and to a limited extent
5’phospho-adducts within DNA strand breaks (reviewed
in [1]). Tdp1 catalysis is structurally and mechanistically
conserved from yeast (y) to human (h), and centers on
the formation and resolution of a requisite covalent
TDP1-DNA reaction intermediate, also called a TDP1DNA covalent complex (TDP1-cc) (Figure 1). This
two-step cycle utilizes spatial and temporal coordinated
action of two catalytic histidines [2–8]. During step
1, the nucleophilic histidine (Hisnuc: hTDP1His263 and
yTDP1His182) attacks the DNA 3’phospho-adduct
bond to form a TDP1-cc. In step 2, the second histidine
functions as a general acid/base (Hisgab: hTDP1His493
and yTDP1His432) and activates water to hydrolyze

substrates for TDP1. Hence, TDP1 is able to hydrolyze
3’phospho-tyrosyl (TOPO1-DNA), 3’phospho-hystidyl
(TDP1-DNA), and 5’phospho-tyrosyl (TOPO2-DNA)
linkages [3, 4, 11, 13–21]. Moreover, TDP1 is also able
to hydrolyze smaller substrates predominantly from the
3’-end of the DNA but also 5’ oriented adducts including
damaged nucleotides, such as 3’phospho-glycolates or
5’- and 3’-abasic sites generated by oxidative damage,
γ-irradiation and/or chain terminating nucleosides,
e.g. cytarabine and acyclovir [4, 18, 22–27]. Thus,
TDP1 is a versatile DNA repair enzyme involved in the
removal of DNA-adducts generated by a wide variety of
chemotherapeutics and endogenously generated toxins.
Stabilization of enzyme-DNA intermediates can
also be achieved via the introduction of mutations. For
example, there is a naturally occurring Tdp1HisgabArg
(hTdp1H493R) mutation identified in patients with the
neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia with
axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) [28]. This point mutation
enhances the stability of the covalent Tdp1H493R-cc
due to delayed hydrolysis of the 3’phospho-histidyl
bond [3, 29]. Moreover, the HisgabArg mutant enzyme
characteristics are conserved from human to yeast. Some
of those characteristics include increased stability of
the TDP1-DNA complex that coincides with a reduced
catalytic activity in vitro and increased cell sensitivity to
DNA damaging agents, such as CPT, bleomycin, H2O2,
γ-irradiation, and chain-terminating nucleoside analogs [3,
4, 22, 30, 31]. Additionally, we have identified alternative
substitutions of yTDP1Hisgab, including yTdp1H432N,
that induce more severe cellular toxicity than the yeast
SCAN1-mutant analog (yTdp1H432R) [3, 4]. Moreover,
the yTdp1H432N mutant formed stable TDP1-DNA

intermediates in yeast [3, 4]. These observations suggest
that TDP1-DNA intermediate stabilization by catalytic
dysregulation converts yTDP1 into a cellular poison,
exposing a potential novel anti-cancer therapeutic strategy.

RESULTS
Expression of hTDP1 mutants in yeast induces
hTOPO1-dependent toxicity
To examine if the molecular basis of the TDP1induced toxicity of yTDP1 catalytic mutants [3, 4, 32] is
a conserved property of the TDP1 family, we generated
the analogous human HisnucAla (H263A) and HisgabArg/
Asn (H493R/N) substitutions. Mutant hTDP1 alleles
were expressed from plasmid-borne galactose-inducible
(GAL1) promoter constructs. To facilitate species-specific
interactions, hTOPO1 was also expressed from the GAL1promoter but borne on a different plasmid. Co-expression
of the hTDP1 mutants with hTOPO1 in a TOP1,TDP1
deleted (top1Δ,tdp1Δ) yeast strain [32] induced a TOPO1dependent cellular toxicity (Figure 2A). Expression of the
hTdp1H493R mutant had marginal effects on yeast cell
viability, similar to wild type hTDP1, while hTdp1H493N
and hTdp1H263A expression induced toxicity (Figure 2A).
The expression level of the catalytic mutants was similar
to wild type, suggesting that the phenotypes are due to
alterations in catalytic function rather than a difference in
expression (Figure 2B) or expression levels of yeast and
human TOPO1 (shown in [3]). The observed phenotypes
for these hTDP1 mutants are not as robust as the analogous
yeast mutants, which is likely due to the expression of
human enzymes in yeast.

1 (Formation): TDP1 resolves the DNA-adduct via nucleophilic attack of the Hisnuc that releases the adduct and generates a TDP1-DNA
covalent complex via the 3’phospho-amide bond. Step 2 (Dissociation): Hisgab activates a water molecule that hydrolyze the TDP1-DNA
linkage, dissociating TDP1 from the DNA, leaving behind a single-strand nick, which requires further processing by polynucleotide kinasephosphatase prior to DNA ligation.

TDP1 catalytic mutants reduce colony formation
of HEK293 cells

The levels of ectopic expressed protein are >100fold over endogenous TDP1 levels, which is similar as
reported by Barthelmes et al. [14]. Analysis of hTDP1
protein levels demonstrated a consistent reduction of the
hTdp1H493N mutant compared to wild type (Figure 3B).
This might indicate that the mutant enzyme is trapped on
the DNA.

The phenotypes induced by the hTdp1 mutants
in our yeast model imply a conserved mechanism
underlying the substrate (TOPO1)-dependent toxicity
caused by dysregulated TDP1 enzymes [3, 4, 32]. To
determine if these TDP1 mutant enzymes induce toxicity
in human cells, we stably transfected HEK293T-REx
(HEK293Tetracycline-Regulated Expression) cells with
control (no hTDP1), wild-type hTDP1, hTdp1H493N, and
hTdp1H263A expression vectors. The HEK293T-REx cells
contain the Tet-on expression system in which doxycycline
(Dox) treatment induces ectopic hTDP1, hTdp1H493N,
and hTdp1H263A expression from a modified CMVTetO2
promoter. Moreover, these immortalized human cells
express endogenous TDP1 and TOPO1, allowing for the
assessment of the toxic effects of TDP1 mutants with
endogenous TDP1 substrate (e.g. TOPO1-DNA) levels in
ABSENCE of additionally induced genotoxic stress. It is
noteworthy that in our yeast model these conditions do not
result in a toxic phenotype [3, 4, 32].
To evaluate the cytotoxicity induced by the
TDP1 mutants we used an anchorage-dependent colony
formation assay. Cell viability of Dox-induced cells
expressing the ectopic hTDP1 allele was determined
and plotted relative to the not-induced isogenic cells
(no TDP1 expression=100%). Expression of wild-type
hTDP1 induced a reduction in cell viability similar to Dox
treatment alone (vector control). Conversely, expression of
each mutant TDP1 allele induced a significant reduction
in cell viability compared to both vector and hTDP1
expressing cells (Figure 3A). Thus, similar to yTDP1,
hTDP1 can be converted into a cellular toxin by mutation
of either catalytic histidine.

TDP1 mutants accumulate covalent enzymeDNA intermediates in cell
To determine if the toxicity induced by hTdp1H493N
and hTdp1H263A is due to accumulation of covalent
enzyme-DNA complexes, we took a two-pronged
approach. First, we performed a band-depletion assay
in order to observe depletion of the soluble fraction of
TDP1 and recovery of the depleted DNA-bound TDP1
fraction via nuclease treatment of the lysate. Immunoblot
analysis of cell lysates revealed a significant depletion
of hTdp1H493N protein levels (even when loaded with
twice the amount of cell extract as shown in Figure 4A
left panel), suggesting TDP1 is bound to DNA. Indeed,
mutant hTDP1 protein levels were recovered upon
nuclease treatment (Figure 4A right panel). This is similar
to the depletion and recovery of yTdp1H432N observed
previously [4]. Second, we assayed the accumulation of
TDP1 protein bound to the genomic DNA by analyzing the
cellular distribution of the TDP1 mutants. Equal amounts
of cells were harvested and fractionated into the cytosolic/
mitochondrial and nuclear fractions. Subsequently, the
nuclear fraction was separated into nucleoplasm and
genomic DNA to detect TDP1 protein. The TDP1 protein
levels in the cytosolic/mitochondrial fraction (Figure 4B)
correlated with the band-depletion results (Figure 4A left
panel). Analysis of the nucleoplasm and the shredded

Tdp1 catalytic mutants display reduced activity
in vitro

genomic DNA fractions showed that all ectopic expressed
proteins are present in the nucleus, however only the
hTdp1H493N and hTdp1H263A proteins are observed in
the genomic DNA fraction (Figure 4C). Anti-histone
3 (H3) blotting showed that the genomic DNA fraction
was not contaminated with free, unbound proteins of the
nucleoplasm (Figure 4C). This supports that the observed
Tdp1-mutant depletion is due to increased levels of
covalent Tdp1mutant-DNA intermediates.

To assess the catalytic activity of the hTDP1
enzymes and possible in vitro detection of covalent
reaction intermediates, full-length N-terminal FLAGtagged hTDP1 proteins were expressed in a proteasedeficient yeast strain to ensure affinity purified full-length
hTDP1 proteins as described in Comeaux et al. [32].

hTDP1 proteins were incubated in reaction mixtures with
a 32P 5’-end labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide with a
3’phospho-tyrosyl modification as substrate (Figure 5A).
Each reaction was split in two samples and analyzed for
either A) conversion of the 3’phospho-tyrosyl linkage
to a 3’phosphoryl product via a denaturing 20%/8 M
Urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), or B)
formation of covalent TDP1-DNA reaction intermediates
by 12% SDS-PAGE [3]. Relative to wild type hTDP1,
where ~0.45 nM was sufficient to convert 40% of the
substrate into a product, hTdp1H493N exhibited ~150-fold
lower activity. Surprisingly, hTdp1H493R and hTdp1H263A
exhibited a similar reduction in activity of ~64-fold
less (Figure 5B and 5C). Detection of the hTdp1H493NDNA intermediates in the Urea-PAGE required longer
exposure compared to detection the hTdp1H493R-DNA
intermediates (Figure 5B, *cc represents only the top part
of hTdp1H493N gel). SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that
the detected protein-DNA intermediates are indeed Tdp1DNA covalent complexes and showed that hTdp1H493NDNA levels are low compared to hTdp1H493R-DNA levels
(Figure 5D). However, this is the first time that covalent
TDP1-DNA complexes were detected by a Tdp1Hisgabmutant enzyme (yeast or human) other than the HisgabArg
substitution. The detected hTdp1H263A enzyme activity
supports the observed cellular toxicity and the detection of
Tdp1H263A-DNA covalent intermediates in cells (Figures
3A and 4C, respectively). Moreover, the question remains
as to why we detect -reduced- hTdp1H263A catalytic
activity in vitro while it was reported to be catalytically
inactive [5, 8].

was able to form a covalent intermediate with genomic
DNA to induce cytotoxicity. This led us to postulate the
presence of an alternative nucleophilic residue within the
catalytic pocket. Sequence analysis of TDP1 orthologs
exposed a highly conserved histidine preceding the Hisnuc
as a potential candidate that can act as an alternative
nucleophile (Figure 6A). To verify that this histidine, His262
in hTDP1, is able to function as an alternative nucleophile,
we mutated His262 to Ala in wild-type and hTdp1H263A
mutant alleles. We examined these mutants in our
top1Δ,tdp1Δ yeast strain by co-expression of the hTDP1
allele with hTOPO1 as discussed above (Figure 2A).
We observed that introduction of H262A substitution in
hTdp1H263A and hTDP1 resulted in cell viability similar
to the wild type hTDP1 protein, while hTdp1H263A
induced cytotoxicity (Figure 6B). This suggests that the
catalytic activity of hTdp1H263A is mediated by His262
functioning as the alternative nucleophile when the Hisnuc
is substituted by Ala, which is not caused by differential
protein expression levels (data not shown).

Topotecan enhances TDP1-induced toxicity
To study the potential of TDP1 as a therapeutic
drug target, we tested the schedule dependency of the
combinational treatment of Tdp1 mutant expression
with topotecan (TPT; reversibly stabilizes Topo1-cc).
We tested two treatment schedules. First: TDP1 protein
expression induced for 4 days, and co-treated with TPT
for 3 days. Second: TPT treatment for 4 days and TDP1
protein expression induced for 3 days. All stable cell lines
showed a similar sensitivity to TPT alone within each
schedule (Figure 7A and 7C). Compared to vector control
cells, elevated expression of wild-type hTDP1 increased
TPT cell sensitivity to sub-nano molar range, while higher
TPT concentration induced similar toxicities in both cell
lines within each schedule (Figure 7B and 7D; blue and

green lines). However, both toxic TDP1 mutant proteins
reveal an increased toxicity in combination with TPT over
the entire curve in both schedules (Figure 7B and 7D;
pink and red lines). TDP1 “poisoning” followed by TPT
treatment results in an increase in dynamic range of 4.6- to
35-fold (Table 1). This suggests that the proposed novel
therapeutic strategy of molecular targeting the TDP1-cc
can result in synergistic toxicity when combined with TPT,
but can also be effective by itself (Figure 7).
Overall TDP1-induced toxicity increased over time.
The combination assays exposed a mild increase in TDP1-

induced toxicity (without TPT) between 3-day induction
(Figure 7D) and 4-day induction (Figure 7B), while a 10day incubation period (colony formation assay; Figure
3A) induced even more toxicity. Both these assays are
based on anchorage-dependent cell growth, which leads
us to the following thought: “Can poisoning of TDP1 via
dysregulation of TDP1-activity using either hTdp1H493N
or hTdp1H263A mutants also decrease the anchorageindependent colony formation, which is suggested to be
a surrogate for the ability to form cancer metastasis [33,
34]?” Indeed, hTdp1H263A significantly reduced colony

formation by ~30% (unpaired student t-test; p=0.0074),
while hTdp1H493N showed a significant reduction of
~45% (p=0.0001), compared to vector control (Figure 8).
These results suggest that the hTdp1H493N mutant is
more efficient to prevent anchorage-independent colony
formation than the hTdp1H263A mutant, which is a reverse
outcome compared to the anchorage-dependent colony
formation assay (compare Figure 3A with Figure 8). In
summary, these results support the potential of targeting
TDP1-cc as a novel anti-cancer treatment strategy, which
will act synergistically with chemotherapeutics that induce
DNA adducts that function as TDP1 substrates.

For example, TDP2 (also known as TTRAP or EAPII),
a multifunctional enzyme that constitutes complementary
DNA repair activities with TDP1, hydrolyzing specifically
the 5’phospho-tyrosyl linkage. However, TDP2 utilizes
a single-Mg2+-dependent catalysis, a mechanism that is
distinct from TDP1, and lacks the formation of covalent
enzyme-DNA intermediates [18, 35–37].
Targeting covalent enzyme-DNA intermediates have
been proven to be a very effective anti-cancer strategy.
For example, etoposide and TPT specifically stabilize the
TOPO2-DNA and TOPO1-DNA covalent intermediates,
respectively, to induce cytotoxic DNA lesions [12, 13].
The suitability of the TDP1-DNA complex for molecular
targeting to develop novel chemotherapeutics is best
illustrated by the identification of an hTdp1HisgabArg mutant
in patients with the autosomal recessive neurodegenerative
disease SCAN1 [28]. This mutant enzyme exhibits
a reduced dissociation rate resulting in a more stable
hTdp1H493R-DNA intermediate and acts as a mild cellular
toxin [3, 28, 29]. Surprisingly, this alteration only causes
a progressive cerebellar atrophy whose symptoms first
present during the second decade of life without developing
other disorders including immuno-deficiencies, cancers,

DISCUSSION
Our reported yeast observations suggested that
TDP1 is a suitable target to turn a DNA repair enzyme into
a cellular toxin as a potential novel anti-cancer treatment
strategy [3, 4, 32]. TDP1 is unique among DNA repair
enzymes due to the requisite formation of a covalent
TDP1-DNA reaction intermediate (Figure 1). Other
enzymes that remove adducts from the 3’- and 5’-end of
DNA nicks do not form a covalent enzyme-DNA complex.

or myopathy [28, 38]. The mechanistic defect and mild
phenotype of this substitution are conserved from human
to yeast [3, 4, 28, 29]]. Moreover, we reported that
substituting smaller polar or aliphatic side chains such as
Asn for yTdp1Hisgab results in more severe phenotypes
that form stable enzyme-DNA reaction intermediates in
the cell but not with an artificial in vitro oligonucleotide
substrate [3, 4]. The observations described above, together
with our reported yeast model and the pathobiology of the
SCAN1 related TDP1 mutant, support the proposed novel
treatment strategy of molecular targeting stabilization of the
TDP1-DNA covalent complex for cancer treatment. What's
more, most TDP1 substrates are formed by clinically active
(chemo-)therapeutics and endogenous reactive oxygen
species whose levels are elevated in cancer cells [3, 4, 11,
13, 14, 16–20, 22, 23, 25–27, 39–45].
Indeed, the herein described observations support
that molecular targeting to stabilize the TDP1-DNA
intermediate is a potential novel cancer treatment strategy.
Expression of human Tdp1 HisnucAla and HisgabAsn

mutants in HEK293 cells show growth inhibition and
reduced anchorage-dependent and -independent colony
formation compared to wild type (Figure 2A, Figure 7B,
7D and Figure 8). Additionally, these hTDP1 mutants
show an accumulation of TDP1-genomic DNA reaction
intermediates (Figure 4C). These mutants also display
a reduced catalytic activity compared to the wild-type
enzyme without an easily detectable formation of enzymeDNA complexes (Figure 5). All these phenotypes are
conserved from yeast to human. These results also imply
that simple oligonucleotide-based substrates used with in
vitro reactions are best suited for determining the catalytic
activity of TDP1 in contrast to the formation of covalent
intermediates, which are best observed in a cellular based
assay. This indicates that covalent intermediates are a
product of the sum of more physiologically relevant
substrates and protein-protein interactions that are not
replicated in vitro.
Yet our observations surprised us on multiple points.
First, we detected catalytic activity in vitro and a cellular

Thirdly, the observed phenotype of hTdp1H263A and
hTdp1H493N in the human cell model without additional
genotoxic stress was unexpected. Under similar conditions
in our yeast model we do not observe toxicity [3, 4].
Moreover, TDP1 activity and as such the level of TDP1induced toxicity depends on the existences of TDP1
substrates (DNA adducts) since TDP1 cannot function
as an endonuclease [3, 27, 45]. In addition, HEK293
cells express endogenous wild type TDP1, which is able
to remove TDP1-DNA intermediates. We hypothesize
that this heightened sensitivity observed in human cells
compared to yeast is likely due to specific differences
between the models. Our yeast model is proficient in all
DNA repair and DNA damage response pathways, which
is not the case for the human cell model. HEK293 cells
and other non-cancerous cell lines are immortalized,
while cancer cells contain defects that allow them to
continuously grow. HEK293 cells are generated by
transfection of sheared adenovirus 5 DNA cells, which
resulted in p53 inhibition by the large E1B-proteins of
adenovirus 5 [46]. Atsumi et al. recently reported that
transformed / immortalized cells that harbor mutant or
inhibited ARF or p53 are more sensitive to DNA damage
induced via replication stress, such as treatment with
CPT or hydroxyurea, but not other DNA damage, e.g.
doxorubicin or cisplatin [47, 48]. This suggests that the
TDP1-induced toxic DNA lesion may result in replication
stress to induce the observed cytotoxicity. This suggests
that increased stabilization of the covalent TDP1-DNA
complex will have a more toxic effect in cells impaired
for ARFs/p53 and/or DNA damage response pathway
such as cancer cells than in healthy cells. Thus, in contrast
to inhibiting TDP1 activity, stabilization of the TDP1DNA reaction intermediate might be a more efficacious
therapeutic approach to treat cancer (Figure 9).

phenotype with the reported catalytic inactive hTdp1H263A
mutant [5, 8]. We recently reported a similar observation
for the analogous yeast yTdp1H182A mutant [32]. We
concluded that the His preceding the Hisnuc is able to rotate
into the catalytic pocket in case Hisnuc is substituted for Ala
[3]. Our results suggest that this action is conserved from
yeast to human. An hTdp1H262AH263A double mutant did
not reduce cell viability in our yeast model (Figure 6B),
which was also observed in an anchorage-independent
colony formation assay (data not shown, n=2). Moreover,
this suggests that a catalytic inhibitor of TDP1 might not
have a significant biological effect in malignancies in
which TDP1 is not essential.
For the second point: Although the exact mechanism
underlying the toxicity induced by these Tdp1 mutants has
yet to be determined (ongoing investigation), it involves
the formation of more stable TDP1-DNA reaction
intermediates (Figure 4). However, the kinetics of these
enzyme-DNA covalent complexes is understudied, which
is technically challenging to study in cells. Nevertheless, it
is interesting that for the most toxic mutant (hTdp1H263A)
we detect smaller amount of enzyme-DNA intermediates
than for the lesser toxic hTdp1H493N mutant (Figure 4C).
In general enzyme-DNA intermediates are considered
similar in stability, yet the above described data together
with our previous observations with yeast Rad9 DNA
repair checkpoint deficient strain [32] suggests differently.
These catalytic mutants do contain differences as a result
of their specific substitutions. Their catalytic pockets are
different in electrostatic surface charge and topology
(depth, shallowness) as shown for the yeast TDP1 enzymes
[3]. This will influence the interaction with the DNA and
the conformation of their enzyme-DNA covalent complex,
and thus the stability of the complex that correlates with
the ability to induce cell lethality.

Figure 9: Model of two distinct TDP1 targeted therapeutic approaches. Depicted is a schematic representation of TDP1 two-

step catalytic cycle. The first approach; Catalytic TDP1 inhibitor: This approach prevents repair of chemotherapeutics-induced DNA
damage, enhancing their efficacy. The second approach; Poisoning or drug-mediated stabilization of the TDP1-DNA covalent complex.
This approach represents the ability of molecular stabilization of the obligatory TDP1-DNA reaction intermediate by blocking TDP1
dissociation from the genomic DNA, inducing a more stable DNA-adduct resulting in cell lethality.

was scanned (CanoScan LiDe 200, Canon), and all images
(film scans or ChemiDoc acquired) were processed via
Adobe Photoshop CS6 to correct signal levels (if needed)
of the complete image before cropping the shown area
(band of interest +/- 0.5 to 1 cm margin). Final figures
were generated in Illustrator CS6.

Yeast strains and plasmids
Saccharomyces
cerevisiae
strain
KWY4
[top1Δ,tdp1Δ] (MATα, ura3Δ::LoxP his3Δ200 leu2Δ1
trp1Δ63 tdp1ΔSD top1Δ::HIS5) was generated from
FY-250 (MATα, ura3-52, his3A200, leu2Al, trp1Δ63) by
gene replacement of TOP1 with HIS5 and the ura3-52
allele with LoxP-KANr-LoxP, followed by CRE-mediated
recombination to yield ura3Δ::LoxP, and TDP1 using
URA3 flanked by gene endogenous TDP1 3’UTR repeats,
followed by selection on 5-FOA resulting in tdp1ΔSD
(Seamless Delete) to recover URA3-selection [3, 49–
51]. ECY2 (KWY4, pep4Δ::TRP1, prb1Δ::URA3) was
generated by gene replacement of PEP4 with TRP1 and
PRB1 with URA3 in KWY4. In all cases, gene deletions
were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing.
For yeast cell viability studies, hTDP1 is
expressed from the galactose-inducible promoter
GAL1 in YCpGAL1-hTDP1·L vectors as described in
Gajewski et al. [3]. hTDP1 mutant alleles were created
using the QuikChangeII Site-Directed Mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene). hTOPO1 was expressed from the
galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter of the YCpGALhTOPO1·U plasmid [52]. For cell viability studies in
human cells, the hTDP1 alleles were N-terminally
HA-tagged via PCR and cloned into the pcDNA4/TO
expression vector (pcDNA4/TO-HAhTDP1) containing
a tetracycline /doxycycline-inducible CMVTetO2
promoter (Invitrogen).
For protein purification from yeast (see also [32]),
N-terminal Flag-tagged hTDP1 constructs, produced
by PCR amplification, were subsequently cloned into
a YEpGAL4-10GAL1 vector to yield YEpGAL410GAL1-FLAGhTDP1·L vectors. All hTDP1 alleles were
confirmed by DNA sequencing and PCR primer sequences
are available upon request.

Yeast viability assays
Semi-quantitative colony formation assays were
performed as described in He et al. [4]. Briefly, cultures
of yeast cells co-transformed with indicated vectors
were diluted to OD595 of 0.3 in TE buffer (50 mM Tris,
5 mM EDTA) and 10-fold serial diluted. 5 μl aliquots
of each dilution were spotted onto selective medium
plates containing 2% galactose and incubated for 4 days
at 30°C. At least three independent experiments were
assayed.

HEK293T-REx stably transfected cell lines
HEK293T-REx cells (Invitrogen) were transfected
with Xho1 linearized pcDNA4-CMV-vectors containing
the N-terminally HA-tagged hTDP1 ORF of interest
(wild type hTDP1 or hTDP1 catalytic mutants) or an
empty vector as control, using Lipofectamine 2000
in 6-well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C and
5% CO2. Cells were harvested, diluted 1:10, 1:100,
1:1000, and seeded in duplicate in 10 cm dishes for
each dilution and incubated at 37°C overnight. 24 hours
later selection medium DMEMzb (DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 150 μg/ml zeocin
(for pcDNA4 vector) and 5 μg/ml blasticidin [T-REx
selection]) was added. The selection medium was
replaced every 3-4 days without disturbing the cells.
Once colonies were formed, colonies were picked
using a collection ring and transferred to a 96-well
plate. At 90-95% confluence cells were transferred to
larger wells until steadily grown in T-75 flasks. Multiple
clones were isolated for each introduced hTDP1 allele
and checked for similar HAhTDP1 protein expression.
Multiple clones showed similar expression levels, and
two arbitrary series of stably transfected clones were
selected. One series was used for all assays in triplicate.
The other series was used as a control to omit clonal
effects due to the integration of the introduced ectopic
plasmid. We observed similar outcomes in all tested
assays (data not shown). For all used cell lines, the
inserted TDP1 cDNAs of the stably transfected lines
were verified via sequencing. In addition, all cell lines
were authenticated (June 2016) by the UAB Heflin
Center Genomic Core Laboratories using the Applied
Biosystems AmpFISTR system to screen 15 different
small tandem repeat (STR) markers and the Amelogenin
locus for gender determination. These STR markers
include those genotyped by the ATCC.

Immunoblotting of yeast cell extracts
As described in He et al. [4], exponentially growing
cultures of cells transformed with expressing TDP1 under
the GAL1 promoter were induced for 6 hours with 2%
galactose, corrected to the same OD595, and lysed with
acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) at 4°C in 50 mM Tris,
pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, and
Complete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor (Roche). Lysate
was boiled in SDS buffer for 10 minutes and aliquots
were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF,
immunostained with anti-hTDP1 (ab4166, Abcam) and
anti-αtubulin (MCA77G, AbD Serotec) antibodies, and
visualized by chemiluminescence.
All chemiluminescence (in this manuscript) is
detected via film or with the ChemiDoc MP Imaging

8.0). Half of the cell lysate was added to 6X SDS sample
buffer and boiled, while to the other half 6,000 gel units
of Micrococcal Nuclease (NEB) was added and incubated
at 37°C for 30 minutes. Digestion of genomic DNA was
stopped by addition of 6X SDS sample buffer and boiling.
Aliquots were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE, blotted
onto PVDF and immunostained with anti-hTDP1 and antiαtubulin antibodies, and visualized by chemiluminescence.
Images are processed as described in “immunoblotting of
yeast extracts.”

Exponentially growing stably transfected HEK293
cells with indicated HAhTDP1 allele or vector control
cells were harvested, and 1,000 cells/well in a 6-well
plate were seeded in DMEMzb. After 24 hours, cells in 2
wells were treated with 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) to
induce hTDP1 expression, and cells in 2 other wells were
not induced. After incubating for 10 days, cells were fixed
with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.025%
crystal violet and air-dried. Colonies were quantified
using LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imager at a fluorescence
of 700 nm. The readout (light units or LU) of the 2 wells
was averaged for each condition and cell line. The relative
cell viability was calculated [LU +Dox/ LU -Dox] x100%
for each cell line and the average with the standard
deviation was determined from at least three independent
experiment and plotted. Significance was determined
using the unpaired student t-test (Prism 7, GraphPad).

Purification of hTDP1 protein from yeast
extracts
N-terminal Flag-tagged hTDP1 alleles were
expressed from YEpGal4-10GAL1-FLAGhTDP1·L
vectors in protease-deficient top1Δ,tdp1Δ cells (ECY2
strain). Exponential cultures were induced with
2% galactose for 6 hours, cells were harvested, and
FLAGhTDP1 protein purified as described in [32]. Briefly,
cell extracts in HEE/2PI buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0,
5 mM EDTA, 5mM EGTA, 2PI [2xprotease inhibitor
cocktail, Sigma]) were loaded onto SP Sepharose fast flow
matrix (GE Life Sciences) and eluted with HEE/2PI/0.4
M NaCl, then affinity purified by anti-FLAG M2 affinity
chromatography matrix (Sigma). FLAGhTDP1 was eluted
with 3X FLAG peptide in TEEK (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1
mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT) and
concentrated in an Ultracel-30K concentrator (Millipore).
Concentration was determined by Bradford-assay (Bio
Rad) and purity was determined by sypro-ruby (Bio Rad)
staining of hTDP1 fractions resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE.

Immunoblotting of fractionated human cell
extracts
Exponentially growing stably transfected HEK293
cells with indicated HAhTDP1 allele or vector control
cells were induced with 1 μg/ml Dox in DMEMzb for 48
hours. Cells were harvested and equal amounts of cells
were resuspended in CLB buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH
8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM
CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2). The lysate was centrifuged at
5000g at 4°C for 5 minutes and cytosolic/mitochondrial
fraction (supernatant) was collected. To obtain genomic
DNA fraction, the (nuclear) pellet was resuspended in
TSE buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mM sucrose, 1 mM
EDTA), incubated for 30 minutes on ice, and centrifuged
at 2300g at 4°C for 5 minutes. The nucleoplasm
(supernatant) was collected and the pellet washed twice
with TSE buffer and sonicated to shear the genomic DNA
to re-solubilize covalently bound proteins. All buffers
contain Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche).
Lysate aliquots were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE,
blotted onto PVDF and immunostained with anti-hTDP1
and anti-αtubulin or anti-Histone H3 (Ab46765, Abcam)
antibodies, and visualized by chemiluminescence. Images
are processed as described in “immunoblotting of yeast
extracts.”

hTDP1 in vitro activity assay
Activity
assays
were
performed
as
described in Gajewski et al. [3]. Briefly, 14-mer
(5’-GATCTAAAAGACTT-3’) oligonucleotide with
a 3’phospho-tyrosine was used as a substrate and an
identical oligonucleotide with a 3’-phosphate was used
as product control (Midland Certified Reagent Company,
Inc.). 5’-32P end-labeled oligonucleotides (250 fmol) were
incubated in 18 μl reaction buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5,
1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT) with indicated
amounts of TDP1 for 10 min at 30°C. Reaction samples
were split and either combined with USB stop buffer/
8 M Urea for analysis in 20% PAA/Urea sequencing
gel or with 6xSDS-PAGE sample buffer for analysis in
12% SDS-PAGE. Reaction products were visualized by
Phosphor-Imager screens, scanned with a Storm 865
scanner (GE Life Sciences), and quantified with Image
Studio Software version 3.1.4 LI-COR). All images were
processed in Adobe Photoshop CS6 to correct signal levels
of the complete image followed by cropping one enzyme’s
concentration range to obtain separated panels, and final
figures were generated in Illustrator CS6.

Band-depletion of TDP1 protein
Exponentially growing stably transfected HEK293
cells with indicated HAhTDP1 allele or vector control
cells were induced with 1 μg/ml Dox in DMEMzb for
48 hours. Cells were harvested and equal amounts of
cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (200 mM NaOH,
5 mM EDTA), incubated for 15 minutes on ice and then
neutralized with Neutralization buffer (600 mM Tris, pH
