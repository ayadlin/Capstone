Abstract
In several neoplastic diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma, the expression of P-glycoprotein and cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) are often increased and involved in drug resistance
and poor prognosis. P-glycoprotein, in addition to drug
resistance, blocks cytochrome c release, preventing apoptosis
in tumor cells. Because COX-2 induces P-glycoprotein expression, we evaluated the effect of celecoxib, a specific inhibitor
of COX-2 activity, on P-glycoprotein–mediated resistance to
apoptosis in cell lines expressing multidrug resistant (MDR)
phenotype. Experiments were done using MDR-positive and
parental cell lines at basal conditions and after exposure
to 10 or 50 Mmol/L celecoxib. We found that 10 Mmol/L celecoxib reduced P-glycoprotein, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 expression,
and induced translocation of Bax from cytosol to mitochondria and cytochrome c release into cytosol in MDR-positive
hepatocellular carcinoma cells. This causes the activation of
caspase-3 and increases the number of cells going into
apoptosis. No effect was shown on parental drug-sensitive
or on MDR-positive hepatocellular carcinoma cells after
transfection with MDR1 small interfering RNA. Interestingly,
although inhibiting COX-2 activity, 50 Mmol/L celecoxib
weakly increased the expression of COX-2 and P-glycoprotein
and did not alter Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression. In conclusion,
these results show that relatively low concentrations of celecoxib induce cell apoptosis in MDR cell lines. This effect is
mediated by P-glycoprotein and suggests that the efficacy
of celecoxib in the treatment of different types of cancer
may depend on celecoxib concentration and P-glycoprotein
expression. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4915–23]

Introduction
One type of drug resistance to anticancer compounds is
mediated by the overexpression of the P-glycoprotein, the product of multidrug resistant (MDR1) gene (1). P-glycoprotein is
a membrane-associated glycoprotein and a member of the ATPbinding cassette superfamily of membrane transport proteins (2).
P-glycoprotein works like an energy-dependent efflux pump to
extrude anticancer drugs and other compounds from tumor
cells (3).

Previous studies have shown increased levels of the inducible
enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in various types of carcinoma,
including hepatocellular carcinoma (4). Cyclooxygenases (COX-1
and COX-2) are enzymes that catalyze the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and thromboxanes (5). COX-1 is
constitutively expressed in many tissues and is responsible
for various physiologic functions (6–8). COX-2 is an immediateearly inducible gene that responds to various stimuli, such as
mitogens, cytokines, and growth factors; and is involved in
inflammation, regulation of cell growth, differentiation, prevention
of apoptosis, tumorigenesis, and angiogenesis (7, 9–14).
The expression of P-glycoprotein and COX-2 in cancerous tissues
varies according to several factors, decreasing with the increase of
anaplasia (4, 15). This observation suggests that P-glycoprotein and
COX-2 can play a role in early stage of carcinogenesis and in
malignity in many organs, liver included, although very few links
have been shown between P-glycoprotein and COX-2 pathways. We
showed that the development of the MDR phenotype is associated
with a constitutive expression of COX-2 and inducible nitric oxide
synthase in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and these
enzymes may enhance the angiogenic activity of the MDR-positive
hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (16, 17). Moreover, a causal link
between expression and activity of COX-2 and P-glycoprotein was
shown (18–21). Cells expressing the MDR phenotype are more
resistant to several agents that trigger cell apoptosis compared
with parental drug-sensitive cells (22). This phenomenon can be
linked to the fact that MDR-positive cells exhibit a block in the
release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol and,
because of this, they seem protected from undergoing apoptosis
(23). This feature of MDR-positive cells seems to be dependent on
overexpression of Bcl-xL, an antiapoptotic protein that belongs to
the Bcl-2 family (23). Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 act on the release of
cytochrome c from mitochondria by modulating the activity of the
voltage-dependent anion channel (24). Their overexpression blocks
cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3 (25). Moreover,
the transfection of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line PLC/
PRF/5 with a plasmid vector containing recombinant bcl-2 makes
these cells resistant to doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting
a possible link between P-glycoprotein and Bcl-2 family members
expression (26).
COX-2 is thought to play a role in cell apoptosis, but the signaling
pathways affected by COX-2 expression and/or activity are still not
fully understood (27). The COX inhibitors, known as coxibs, inhibit
the proliferation and induce apoptosis in cultured hepatocellular
carcinoma cells, although these inhibitors are known to mediate
effects through both COX-dependent and COX-independent mechanisms (28). Celecoxib induces cytochrome c release, activation
of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and eventually apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (29, 30). However, its mechanism of action

should be further explored. It is possible to prevent celecoxibinduced cell death by z-Val Ala Asp (Ome)-fluoromethylketone
(z-VAD), a wide-spectrum inhibitor of caspase activity (29). Celecoxib, a well-known inhibitor of COX-2 activity, induces apoptosis
also in cells that lack the COX-2 enzyme (31).
Because COX-2 and P-glycoprotein proteins are expressed in
hepatocellular carcinoma (16, 32), they could affect the apoptotic
pathways and cooperate in the development of the MDR
phenotype, at least in human hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent
years, inhibitors of COX-2, celecoxib included, have been proposed
in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, and in fact, the inhibition of COX-2 was proved to possess antiproliferative action (33).
Based on these observations, this work was done to examine the
effect of celecoxib on different cell lines expressing the MDR
phenotype. To address this issue, the expressions of P-glycoprotein,
COX-2, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL; the release of mitochondrial cytochrome
c; the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria; the percentage of
fragmented Hoechst-positive nuclei, of Annexin V–positive cells,
and of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)–mediated nick
end labeling (TUNEL)–stained cells; and the cell death were
assessed at basal conditions and after exposure to celecoxib in
different cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Experiments were done mainly on a human hepatocellular
carcinoma cell line PLC/PRF/5 (34), by using the drug-sensitive clone (P5)
and the highly MDR subclone [P1(0.5)], and confirmative experiments were
done on human colon cancer drug-sensitive (HT-29) and drug-resistant
(HT-29-dx) cells, on human ovarian cancer cells (IGROV-1), and on murine
NIH3T3 drug-sensitive (PSI-2) and drug-resistant (PN1A) cells.
The P1(0.5) subclone was developed by serial prolonged exposures to
increasing concentrations of doxorubicin (Pharmacia & Upjohn) starting
from parental P5 cells, and subsequently cultured in DMEM containing
0.5 Ag/mL doxorubicin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), as previously
reported (16). The human colon carcinoma cells HT-29 and the
subpopulation of doxorubicin-resistant cells (HT29-dx) were kindly donated
by Dr. A. Bosia (Department of Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry,
University of Turin, Turin, Italy). The HT-29 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% FBS; the HT-29-dx were maintained in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 34 nmol/L doxorubicin, as described
by C. Riganti et al. (35). The human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line
(IGROV-1), kindly provided by Dr. J.H. Schellens (the Netherlands Cancer
Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), was maintained in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% FBS (36). Two subclones of NIH3T3 cells, one of
which is drug-resistant (PN1A) and the other drug-sensitive (PSI-2), were
originally provided by J.M. Croop (Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, James
Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapolis, IN) and were cultured
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS; 0.1 Ag/mL doxorubicin was added
to the PN1A cell medium, as previously described (37). The PN1A cell line
was generated by transfection of PSI-2 cells with expression vector pBAmdr, which contained mouse mdr1 cDNA. All cell lines were cultured at
37jC in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Cell treatment. Because only a part of celecoxib added to medium
containing 10% FBS is protein-unbound and hence available for interacting
on cells, doxorubicin-free, serum-free medium containing celecoxib was
used in all experiments, as described in the details for each experimental
condition (38).
Western blot analysis. Cells were seeded in complete medium for
24 h and then exposed to doxorubicin-free, serum-free medium containing
10 or 50 Amol/L celecoxib (a kind gift of Prof. E. Masini, Department of
Preclinical and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Florence, Florence,
Italy). After 3, 6, and 24 h, total proteins were extracted and evaluated by
Western blot analysis, as previously described (16), using each of the
following primary antibodies: anti–COX-2 polyclonal antibody (Cayman

Chemical); anti–P-glycoprotein (C219) monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem);
anti-Bax polyclonal antibody, anti–Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody, anti–Bcl-xL
monoclonal antibody, and anti–cytochrome c polyclonal antibody
(Oncogene Research Products); anti–caspase-3 (E8) monoclonal antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti–h-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma
Chemical Co.).
Small interfering RNA transfection. Positive control GAPDH small
interfering RNA (siRNA), siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA and a pool of four
different double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides directed against MDR1
(siGENOME SMARTpool, human ABCB1) were purchased from Dharmacon.
P1(0.5) cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes to reach 30% to 50% confluency
after 24 h of incubation, and transfected with a total of 100 nmol/L siRNA
using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) in antibioticfree medium, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight
hours after transfection, total RNA was extracted for reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR) analysis, and 72 h after transfection, total proteins were
extracted for Western blot analysis.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells with
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and quantified by absorbance
spectroscopy. The reverse transcription reaction was done by heating for
5 min at 65jC 5 ng of total RNA, 250 ng of random primer, and 1 mmol/L
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP). After cooling at 4jC, the mixture
was incubated for 50 min at 37jC in the reverse transcription reaction
mixture (10 mmol/L DTT, 20 units RNAsin; Invitrogen), and 200 units of
Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen Life
Technologies). Samples were then heated at 70jC for 15 min. Five microliters
of the synthesized cDNA was then amplified in a 55 AL reaction mixture
containing Taq polymerase buffer, 1 mmol/L dNTP, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.5 Amol/L of each primer, and 0.5 units Taq polymerase (Invitrogen Life
Technologies). The primers used were as follows: for MDR1, 5¶-ATATCAGCAGCCCACATCAT-3¶ and 5¶-GAAGCACTGGGATGTCCGGT-3¶; for GAPDH,
5¶-GCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTC-3¶ and 5¶-GTAGAGGCAGGGATGATGTTC3¶ (39). Amplification cycles were 94jC for 3 min, then 33 cycles at 94jC for 1
min, 58jC for 1 min, 72jC for 1.5 min, followed by 72jC for 15 min. Aliquots
of the PCR product were electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gels, and PCR
fragments were visualized by ethidium bromide staining (39).
Preparation of mitochondrial fractions. Cells were washed twice with
ice-cold PBS, trypsinized, and collected by centrifugation; the pellet was
suspended in 500 AL of ice-cold buffer A [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5),
1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
1 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 Ag/mL
each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A] containing 250 mmol/L sucrose.
Unbroken cells, large plasma membrane pieces, and nuclei were removed
by centrifuging the homogenates at 1,000  g at 4jC for 10 min. The
resulting supernatant was subjected to 10,000  g centrifugation at 4jC for
20 min. The pellet fraction (i.e., mitochondria) was first washed with the
above buffer A containing sucrose and then solubilized in 50 AL of TNC
buffer [10 mmol/L Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 5 mmol/L
CaCl2]. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000  g (4jC, 1 h) to
generate cytosol.
Immunofluorescence analysis of cytochrome c release. Cells were
plated onto a coverslip and were grown in culture medium containing
10% FBS. After 24 h, cells were treated with 10 Amol/L celecoxib in
doxorubicin-free, serum-free medium for 3 h and then were fixed with
paraformaldehyde (3.7% w/v), permeabilized with 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100
for 10 min, blocked with 10% (w/v) normal goat serum, then incubated
overnight with primary antibody at an appropriate dilution (1:500). The
purified anti–cytochrome c monoclonal antibody was obtained from BD
Biosciences PharMingen (BD Biosciences). After washing, samples were
incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes)
at room temperature in the dark. FITC-labeled cells were analyzed by
fluorescence Nikon microscope using standard fluorescein filters (excitation
488 nm).
Hoechst assay. Nuclear morphology was assessed using Hoechst
staining. Cells were plated onto coverslip and were grown in complete
medium. After 24 h at 37jC, the cells were rinsed to remove the detached
cells, and then exposed to doxorubicin-free, serum-free medium containing

preincubated with a cell permeable pan-caspase-inhibitor z-VAD at
20 Amol/L (Sigma). After 6, 12, 18, and 24 h, the dead cells were identified
using the trypan blue staining test. Adherent cells were detached,

Results
Celecoxib modifies P-glycoprotein expression in MDRpositive cells. First, we confirmed that P1(0.5) cells have markedly
higher expression of P-glycoprotein and COX-2 compared with
parental cells P5 (Fig. 1A, i). To evaluate whether COX-2 activity
induced the expression of P-glycoprotein in our model, we determined whether the selective inhibition of COX-2 activity by
celecoxib modified P-glycoprotein and/or COX-2 expression in
P1(0.5) and in parental P5 cells. The levels of P-glycoprotein and
COX-2 expression in P1(0.5) cells cultured in a doxorubicin-free,
serum-free medium for 3, 6, and 24 h were not modified (Fig. 1A, ii).
Western blot analysis clearly showed that the P-glycoprotein
expression was reduced in P1(0.5) cells treated for 3 h with
10 Amol/L celecoxib and the reduced expression persisted at least
up to 24 h, whereas COX-2 expression was not altered (Fig. 1B,
i and ii). On the contrary, cell exposure to a 5-fold higher
concentration of celecoxib (50 Amol/L) weakly increased COX-2
expression at 6 h and P-glycoprotein expression at 24 h in P1(0.5)
cells (Fig. 1C). P-glycoprotein and COX-2 proteins were not expressed in P5 parental cells at basal conditions and their exposure
to celecoxib did not change the expression of these proteins (Fig. 1A,
i, B, i, and C). Because it is known that COX-2 induces P-glyco-

protein expression but it is unknown whether P-glycoprotein can
modify COX-2 expression, we evaluated the effect of inhibiting the
expression of MDR1 by siRNA on COX-2 expression. The MDR1
siRNA reduced the levels of MDR1 mRNA (Fig. 1D, i) and abolished
the expression of P-glycoprotein (Fig. 1D, ii). siRNA targeting
GAPDH strongly reduced GAPDH transcript levels (data not
shown). The inhibition of P-glycoprotein expression was not
observed using the nonspecific control siRNA or the mock
transfection control (data not shown). MDR1 siRNA did not affect
the expression of COX-2 in P1(0.5) cells (Fig. 1D, ii). The inhibitory
effect of celecoxib on P-glycoprotein expression was also evaluated
in different cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1). The levels of
P-glycoprotein in HT-29-dx, IGROV-1, and PN1A cells cultured in
a doxorubicin-free, serum-free medium for 3, 6, and 24 h were not
modified (data not shown). The expression of P-glycoprotein was
reduced in HT-29-dx after 3, 6, and 24 h of treatment with 10 Amol/L
celecoxib (Supplementary Fig. S1A, i and iii). On the contrary,
under the same experimental conditions, the P-glycoprotein levels
were not affected in parental HT-29 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A,
i and ii). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A, iv, celecoxib reduced
P-glycoprotein expression only after 6 h in IGROV-1 cells. Moreover,
P-glycoprotein expression was reduced in mdr1 cDNA transfected

Celecoxib and MDR Phenotype

PN1A cells after treatment with 10 Amol/L celecoxib for 3, 6, and
24 h (Supplementary Fig. S1C, i and iii). No changes in the
expression of P-glycoprotein were observed in parental PSI-2 cells
treated with celecoxib (Supplementary Fig. S1C, i and ii).
Celecoxib modifies Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression in MDRpositive cells. To examine a possible association between Pglycoprotein expression and resistance to mitochondrial-related
apoptosis, the expression of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bax proteins was
determined in parental P5 and in MDR- and COX-2–positive
P1(0.5) cells. Western blot analysis showed that antiapoptotic
proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 were more expressed in P1(0.5) cells than
in parental P5 cells at basal conditions. On the contrary, the
expression of Bax, the proapoptotic member of Bcl-2 family, was
higher in parental P5 than in P1(0.5) cells (Fig. 2A, i). The levels of
Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bax expression in P1(0.5) cells cultured in
doxorubicin-free, serum-free medium up to 24 h were unmodified
(Fig. 2A, ii). Interestingly, 10 Amol/L celecoxib strongly reduced
Bcl-xL expression after 3 and 6 h and weakly after 24 h (Fig. 2B, i
and ii); celecoxib also reduced Bcl-2 expression at 6 h in P1(0.5)
cells (Fig. 2B, i and ii). On the contrary, 50 Amol/L celecoxib did not
alter the expression of these proteins in P1(0.5) cells (data not
shown). No significant changes in Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 expression were
observed in parental P5 cells (Fig. 2B, i).
To test the role of P-glycoprotein in the process of mitochondrial
apoptosis induction, we did siRNA experiments in P1(0.5) cells. The
MDR1 siRNA reduced the expression of antiapoptotic proteins
Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, compared with basal conditions, whereas
10 Amol/L celecoxib did not modify the Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression
in P1(0.5) cells transfected with MDR1 siRNA (Fig. 2C).
Because P-glycoprotein activity may affect mitochondrial
apoptosis induction, we assessed the effect of verapamil and
taurolithocholic acid, two inhibitors of P-glycoprotein activity (40),
on P-glycoprotein, procaspase-3, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bax expression
in MDR-positive cells. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A and B,
the treatment with 10 Amol/L verapamil or 100 or 200 Amol/L
taurolithocholic acid for 3, 6, or 24 h did not modify the expression
of these proteins in P1(0.5) cell line. Moreover, the two inhibitors of
P-glycoprotein activity did not alter the percentage of fragmented
Hoechst-positive nuclei (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Celecoxib induces Bax translocation and mitochondrial
cytochrome c release in MDR-positive cells. The expression of
Bax did not change in P5 and P1(0.5) cells after exposure to
10 Amol/L celecoxib (Fig. 3A). However, a different subcellular
localization of Bax between cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions
was observed in P1(0.5) cells after their exposure to 10 Amol/L
celecoxib for 3, 6, or 24 h. As shown in Fig. 3B, a partial translocation
of Bax to mitochondria was observed after 3 and 6 h of treatment
with 10 Amol/L celecoxib. The subcellular localization of Bax did
not change in parental P5 cells after exposure to celecoxib (Fig. 3B).
To test the hypothesis that 10 Amol/L celecoxib could restore

COX-2–positive cells were treated with 10 or 50 Amol/L celecoxib
for 3, 6, and 24 h, then cells were fractioned and cytosolic and
mitochondrial cytochrome c were analyzed by Western blot
analysis. As shown in Fig. 4A, cytochrome c was released into
the cytosol following treatment of P1(0.5) cells with 10 Amol/L
celecoxib for 3, 6, and, especially, 24 h. On the contrary, cells treated
with a higher concentration of celecoxib (50 Amol/L) did not
release cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol (Fig. 4A).

changes in mitochondrial cytochrome c release were observed
when parental P5 cells were treated with celecoxib (Fig. 4A and B).
Effect of celecoxib on apoptosis and cell death of MDRpositive and MDR-negative cells. Because Bax translocation from
cytosol to the mitochondria and the mitochondrial cytochrome c
release into the cytosol play a crucial role in the induction of
cellular apoptosis, the expression of the precursor form of caspase3 (procaspase-3) was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Moreover,
the percentage of fragmented nuclei, estimated by histochemical
nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258, the percentage of Annexin
V– and TUNEL-positive cells were evaluated in P5 and P1(0.5) cell
lines treated with celecoxib. Evident activation of caspase-3 was
shown by degradation of its precursor form after treatment with
10 Amol/L celecoxib at 3 and 6 h in P1(0.5) cells (Fig. 5A), at 3, 6,
and 24 h in HT-29-dx cells and at 3 and 6 h in IGROV-1 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1A, iii and iv). On the contrary, the
procaspase-3 levels were not affected in parental P5 and HT-29
cells (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S1A ii). In addition, treatment
with 50 Amol/L celecoxib for 3, 6, or 24 h did not modify the
procaspase-3 levels and the percentage of cells with fragmented
Hoechst-positive nuclei in P1(0.5) cells (Fig. 5A and C).

celecoxib for 3 h. Cells labeled with
cytochrome c antibody were visualized by
using a fluorescence microscope (original
magnification, 40); the images are
representative of five separate
experiments.

The inhibition of P-glycoprotein expression by MDR1 siRNA
transfection in P1(0.5) cells prevented the activating effect of
celecoxib on caspase-3 (Fig. 5B).
Treatment of P1(0.5) cells with 10 Amol/L celecoxib for
24 h significantly increased the percentage of cells with fragmented
Hoechst-positive nuclei and the percentage of Annexin V– and
TUNEL-positive cells, whereas the same concentration of celecoxib
had no effect on P5 cells (Fig. 5C and D, i and ii).
Furthermore, treatment with 10 Amol/L celecoxib increased the
number of cells in apoptosis in all P-glycoprotein overexpressing
cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1D, i and ii). The effect of
10 Amol/L celecoxib for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h on the death of P5 and
P1(0.5) cells by trypan blue dye exclusion assay was also evaluated.
As shown in Fig. 6B, celecoxib significantly increased cell death in
P1(0.5) cells compared with doxorubicin-free, serum-free controls,
whereas the same concentration of celecoxib had no effect on
viability of P5 cells (Fig. 6A). Moreover, preincubation with
20 Amol/L Z-VAD, a universal inhibitor of caspases, abrogated
the enhanced cell death induced by celecoxib treatment in MDRpositive cells (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
The presence of intrinsic or acquired MDR is the major factor
responsible for chemotherapy failure in cancer patients who are
undergoing chemotherapy. The MDR phenotype is characterized by
the overexpression of P-glycoprotein in plasma membrane that
works as a pump to extrude anticancer drugs from cells. However,
in addition to the overexpression of P-glycoprotein, the MDR
phenotype is associated with other modifications of cell biology

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

that make cancer cells more resistant to many other mechanisms
of cell damage (2, 41, 42). We have previously shown that the
development of the MDR phenotype is associated with the
constitutive expression of COX-2 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell
lines (16). P-glycoprotein can regulate the mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic pathway, conferring resistance to a caspasedependent mechanism of apoptosis induced by antineoplastic
agents (23). The antitumor effect of COX-2 inhibitors has been
described in recent years although the molecular mechanisms
involved remain elusive (43, 44). The relationship between COX-2
and P-glycoprotein suggests that celecoxib, a specific COX-2
activity inhibitor, may improve results of chemotherapy by
increasing the sensitivity of tumor cells to anticancer drugs.
In the present study, we investigated the effect of celecoxib on
COX-2 and P-glycoprotein expression and on factors involved in
the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, in MDR-positive cell lines,
and in their drug-sensitive parental cell clones. To determine
whether the possible antitumor effects of celecoxib could be dose
dependent, two concentrations of celecoxib were used, the lowest
(10 Amol/L) that can be reached in the clinic and another that is
5-fold higher (50 Amol/L; ref. 45). To our surprise, the lower concentration of celecoxib, in addition to the inhibitory effect on COX2 activity (16), markedly reduced the expression of P-glycoprotein
without affecting COX-2 expression, whereas 50 Amol/L celecoxib,
although inhibited COX-2 activity, weakly enhanced the expression of P-glycoprotein and COX-2. It is known that the higher
concentration of celecoxib inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2
activities (46); thus, it is likely that total inhibition of arachidonic
acid metabolism due to celecoxib could be sensed by cells as being
damaging and could trigger a cell response with overexpression of

Celecoxib and MDR Phenotype

COX-2 and P-glycoprotein proteins. These results are in agreement
with other studies that have shown a COX-2–mediated regulation
of P-glycoprotein expression (18). The observation that only
10 Amol/L celecoxib reduce P-glycoprotein expression suggests a
direct inhibitory effect of celecoxib on P-glycoprotein, which has
no effect on COX-2 expression in MDR-positive cells transfected
with MDR1 siRNA. Moreover, although 10 and 50 Amol/L celecoxib
inhibit COX-2 activity, only the lower concentration sharply reduces
P-glycoprotein expression without altering COX-2 expression.
The double-face activity of celecoxib, depending on its
concentration, on the expression of COX-2 and P-glycoprotein
proteins, was also shown for nitric oxide on apoptosis. In fact, NO
can either be proapoptotic or antiapoptotic according to its
concentration (47). However, this is the first report to document
that celecoxib can inhibit the expression of one protein (i.e.,
P-glycoprotein) at low concentration and, on the contrary, can
increase its expression when a higher concentration is involved. It

is unknown whether this aspect of the biology of celecoxib can
explain the same controversial results observed in clinical trials.
Clearly, it is a point that should be kept in mind when planning
studies using this drug.
Based on these preliminary data, we decided to investigate the
effect of celecoxib at a low concentration, which can be achieved in
the serum of patients after standard anti-inflammatory and
antineoplastic therapy, rather than using a higher concentration,
which is not clinically achievable (45). First, we found that the
MDR-positive clone P1(0.5) has a higher expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 and lower expression of proapoptotic Bax compared with P5 cells. Expressions of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2
seemed to be correlated with that of P-glycoprotein, as evaluated
by MDR1 siRNA transfection experiments. These data confirmed
what is reported in the literature on the association between
P-glycoprotein expression and the abrogation of cytochrome c
release in mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (23).

Figure 6. Effect of celecoxib on cell death of (A ) P5 and (B) P1(0.5) cells,
evaluated by trypan blue exclusion assay. A and B, P5 and P1(0.5) cells
were cultured for 24 h in doxorubicin-free, serum-free medium or treated for
6, 12, 18, and 24 h with 10 Amol/L celecoxib before cell count. Cells were also
preincubated for 1 h with 20 Amol/L z-VAD before the addition of celecoxib
(z-VAD +celecoxib 10 Amol/L). Columns, means of five separate experiments in
triplicate, expressed as percentage of dead cells out of the total amount of cells;
bars, SE. *, P < 0.05 versus control; **, P < 0.05 versus z-VAD + celecoxib.
Comparison was made by two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc
test.

Although it is known that celecoxib induces apoptosis in cultured
hepatocellular carcinoma cells through COX-dependent and COXindependent mechanisms (28, 48), the precise function of celecoxib
on the apoptotic signaling pathways remains uncertain. Zhang et al.
(49) have shown that celecoxib at 50 Amol/L induced apoptosis
through a mechanism involving Akt inactivation without altering
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels in rat cholangiocarcinoma cells. In
agreement with them, we found that 50 Amol/L celecoxib did not
alter Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 expression (data not shown). Only the 10 Amol/L
celecoxib reduced both Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 protein expression in Pglycoprotein–overexpressing cells and remained without effect in
the same cells after transfection with MDR1 siRNA. Thus, the
inhibitory effect of 10 Amol/L celecoxib on Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 seems to
be dependent on the expression of P-glycoprotein because its
suppression by the MDR1 siRNA made 10 Amol/L celecoxib
completely ineffective.
To assess the role of the activity of P-glycoprotein in this
mechanism, experiments were done to test the effect of known
P-glycoprotein activity inhibitors, such as verapamil and taurolithocholic acid, on the behavior of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bax proteins.
These two compounds did not modify the expression of Pglycoprotein, procaspase-3, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bax proteins, ruling
out the possibility that P-glycoprotein activity can modulate the
expression of these proteins. The proapoptotic effect of celecoxib
was further confirmed by the observation that 10 Amol/L
celecoxib, although not affecting the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax, caused its translocation from cytosol to
mitochondria in P1(0.5) cells.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

These data show that celecoxib restores the release of
cytochrome c from the mitochondria when MDR-positive cells
are exposed to 10 Amol/L celecoxib. This effect was shown only
in the P-glycoprotein–overexpressing cell clones, whereas no
effects were observed in no P-glycoprotein–overexpressing cells.
Release of cytochrome c into cytosol initiates the activation of
caspase-3 and increases the number of apoptotic cells. Moreover,
the celecoxib-induced activation of caspase-3 is mediated by
P-glycoprotein expression because the procaspase-3 cleavage was
abolished when cells were transfected with the MDR1 siRNA.
Recently, Mantovani et al. (50) have shown that P-glycoprotein is
cleaved in a caspase-3–dependent manner. Considering the
findings of the present work together with those by Mantovani
et al., it can be hypothesized that the expression of P-glycoprotein
blocks cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol and,
consequently, the activation of caspase-3. Therefore, the celecoxib-induced decrease in P-glycoprotein expression causes the
release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-3. This
enzyme cleaves P-glycoprotein, priming a caspase-3–mediated
amplification of the apoptotic signaling pathways. If this is true,
for the first time a self-enhancing mechanism (celecoxib-mediated
reduction of P-glycoprotein expression leads to cytochrome c
release and to the activation of caspase-3, which, in turn, can
reduce P-glycoprotein levels) has been identified and could be
considered a step to a no-return pathway for apoptosis in tumor
cells. Celecoxib significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic
cells, estimated by Hoechst 33258 staining, Annexin V assay, and
TUNEL assay; and cell death, estimated by trypan blue exclusion
assay, in P1(0.5) cells, without affecting apoptosis and viability of
P5 cells. Accordingly, the preincubation of cells with z-VAD, a
universal inhibitor of caspases, abrogated the enhanced cell death
induced by celecoxib treatment. The recent evidence that Pglycoprotein is expressed and active in mitochondria membrane
further contributes to the understanding of molecular mechanisms of these phenomena (37).
In conclusion, this work confirms that celecoxib exerts more
than one pharmacologic action on cells. In the model of human
hepatocellular carcinoma cells overexpressing the MDR phenotype as well as in other MDR-positive cells, celecoxib exerts a
direct effect on the expression of P-glycoprotein and therefore on
apoptotic pathways. MDR phenotype–expressing cells are intrinsically resistant to apoptosis; however, for the first time, we show
that apoptosis can be restored by a P-glycoprotein–dependent
mechanism in MDR-positive cell lines. The use of low doses of
COX-2 inhibitors seems to be a promising approach to improving
cancer chemotherapy outcome because celecoxib, which directly
reduces P-glycoprotein expression, might enhance the susceptibility of tumor cells to apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs.
