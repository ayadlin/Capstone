BACKGROUND. Atrasentan is a potent, oral, selective endothelin-A (ETA) receptor
antagonist that has clinical activity in patients with hormone-refractory prostate
cancer (HRPC). In this article, the authors report the results from a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of atrasentan in patients with
nonmetastatic HRPC.

METHODS. Of 941 patients who had adequate androgen suppression and no radiographic evidence of metastases but rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels,
467 patients were randomized to receive atrasentan at a dose of 10 mg, and 474
patients were randomized to receive placebo daily. The primary endpoint was the
time to disease progression (TTP), which was defined as the onset of metastases.
Secondary endpoints were the time to PSA progression, change in bone alkaline
phosphatase (BALP) levels, PSA doubling time, and overall survival.
RESULTS. There was a 93-day delay in the median TTP with atrasentan, but the

180 days longer with atrasentan. Atrasentan lengthened the PSA doubling time
(P 5 .031) and slowed the increase in BALP (P < .001). The median survival was
1477 days with atrasentan and 1403 days with placebo. The most common adverse
events associated with atrasentan were peripheral edema, nasal congestion, and
headache, consistent with the vasodilatory properties of ETA receptor antagonists.

Atrasentan in Nonmetastatic HRPC/Nelson et al

W

orldwide, more than 200,000 men die annually
from metastatic hormone-refractory prostate
cancer (HRPC), including more than 80,000 in
Europe and an estimated 27,050 in the US.1,2 Widespread use of medical castration has resulted in large
numbers of men undergoing androgen-deprivation
therapy (ADT) before they develop objective metastases. This practice has created a disease state defined
by rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as the first
and only sign of HRPC. In these otherwise asymptomatic men, delaying the emergence of objective
metastatic disease is a worthwhile goal, particularly
if the intervention also is well tolerated. Exploiting
the generally slow progression of nonmetastatic
HRPC, an effective therapy could convert this into a
chronic illness in which overall mortality is no longer
defined primarily by HRPC-specific death.
Since the profound response of prostate cancer
to ADT first was described, 1 finding has remained
unchanged: The initial effectiveness ultimately is
lost. Eventually, approximately 85% of men with
HRPC develop metastatic disease, predominantly in
bone3; and, once these lesions develop, the prognosis
is dire. Quality of life declines rapidly, primarily
reflecting the morbidity associated with bone metastases,4 and the median survival for patients with progressive, castrate, metastatic HRPC who are treated
with chemotherapy is only 16 to 18 months.5,6
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and the endothelin-A (ETA)
receptor are implicated in prostate cancer progression.7-9 ET-1 is produced by normal prostatic epithelium and by primary and metastatic prostate cancer.
Plasma ET-1 concentrations are higher in men with
HRPC than in men with localized disease or in
healthy volunteers. The predominant endothelin receptor on normal prostatic epithelium, ETB, commonly loses expression in prostate cancer, whereas
the expression of ETA is increased and ultimately
predominates as a consequence of transformation.
Indeed, ETA receptor expression in prostate cancer
cells increases with worsening histologic grade and
disease stage.10,11 ET-1 binding to the ETA receptor
acts as a survival factor in a host of benign and malignant cells, including prostate cancer. For example,
ET-1 reduces paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in prostate
cancer in vitro, an effect that is prevented by ETA receptor blockade with the selective ETA receptor antagonist atrasentan; similarly, the combination of
paclitaxel and atrasentan decreased prostate tumor
growth in vivo significantly more than either agent
alone.12
It is even more noteworthy that, in the setting of
bone-metastatic HRPC, prostate cancer-derived ET-1
facilitates interactions between ET-1-secreting tumor

2479

cells and the bone microenvironment, where it acts
as a mitogen for osteoblasts, which express ETA
receptors at high density, and inhibits osteoclast
bone resorptive activity and motility, resulting in new
bone growth.13,14 ET-1, acting through the ETA receptor, is causal in the development of osteoblastic metastases in animal models. Atrasentan, as a potent
ETA selective receptor antagonist, significantly inhibits the development of osteoblastic response to cancer in bone in a variety of model systems.
Atrasentan has demonstrated clinical activity in
patients with HRPC.15-17 In placebo-controlled, phase
2 and 3 clinical trials in patients with asymptomatic
or symptomatic. metastatic HRPC, atrasentan
delayed disease progression and PSA progression,
improving progression-free survival (PFS) and
attenuating the rise in bone alkaline phosphatase
(BALP). Although treatment differences for some efficacy endpoints did not attain statistical significance
for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, they consistently were significant for the evaluable population
in each trial. Coupling this clinical activity with preclinical evidence for the role of ET-1 and ETA in prostate cancer progression, the current trial was
designed to test the hypothesis that atrasentan would
delay the time to disease progression (TTP) in men
with nonmetastatic HRPC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed,
nonmetastatic HRPC; had undergone surgical or
pharmacologic castration (with maintenance androgen-suppression therapy) at least 3 months before
randomization; and had castrate testosterone levels
at screening. Before randomization, PSA levels were
at least 20 ng/mL within 12 months, or had increased
by 50% within 6 months (minimum, 1 ng/mL at
screening), or were rising (2 sequential increases
with a confirmatory third increase) within 12 months
(minimum, 1 ng/mL at screening) with no radiographic evidence of metastases. Other inclusion criteria included a documented, minimum withdrawal
period from antiandrogen therapy of 4 to 6 weeks
before randomization; a Karnofsky performance
score 70; no other malignancies except nonmelanoma skin cancer within the previous 5 years; and
adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.
Patients were ineligible if they were candidates
for local salvage therapy or if they had received any
of the following therapies for prostate cancer or associated pain: cytotoxic chemotherapy or radionuclides; external-beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, or

cryotherapy to the prostatic bed within 6 months
before randomization; radiation therapy to a lesion
outside the prostatic bed >6 months after either castration or initiation of hormone therapy; steroids
within 6 months before randomization; or opioid analgesic therapy within 6 months before randomization. Prohibited treatments included hormonally
active therapies (other than gonadotropin-releasing
hormone agonists), intravenous or oral bisphosphonates, any investigational product within 4 weeks
before randomization, or prior or current treatment
with an endothelin antagonist. Patients with current
cardiovascular disability (New York Heart Association
Class 2 or greater); significant pulmonary disease
requiring chronic or pulse steroid therapy within the
preceding 3 months; or any clinically significant,
unstable, uncontrolled disease were ineligible.
The institutional review boards or independent
ethics committees of all participating investigational
sites approved the protocol. Each patient or his legal
representative signed and dated an approved
informed consent form.

Treatment
Eligible patients were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to double-blinded, daily, oral administration of
atrasentan at a dose of 10 mg or matching placebo
on an outpatient basis. Study treatment continued
until patients experienced confirmed disease progression or unacceptable adverse effects, decided to
discontinue taking the study treatment or to discontinue participation in the study, or until the study
was completed. Patients with confirmed disease progression and those who were active on study at the
time the double-blind period ended (May 31, 2006)
were eligible to enroll in an open-label extension
study in which all participants received atrasentan at
a dose of 10 mg daily. All patients were followed for
survival at 3-month intervals after their final study
visit until January 31, 2007.
If a patient experienced a treatment-related
grade 3 or 4 toxicity according to National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0), the
study drug was then interrupted until the toxicity
resolved to within 1 grade level of baseline, but not
exceeding grade 2. If the toxicity recurred, the study
drug was then interrupted again, and it was reinstated upon resolution as described for the initial
occurrence. A second recurrence required discontinuation of study drug. If resolution was not achieved
within 2 weeks of study drug interruption, then the
study drug was to be discontinued.

Evaluations
Evaluations to ensure that patients met eligibility criteria and to establish baseline values were performed
during a 35-day screening period before randomization. The absence of bone and soft tissue metastases
was evaluated by bone scans and chest/abdominal/
pelvic computed tomography or magnetic resonance
imaging scans, respectively, and was confirmed by
centralized, independent review.
Eligible patients were enrolled and randomly
assigned study drug on Day 1. Subsequent clinic visits, during which patients were assessed for safety
and clinical evidence of disease progression, were
conducted at Day 14; Weeks 4, 8, and 12; and every 6
weeks thereafter. Bone scans were obtained at Week
12 and thereafter at 12-week intervals and underwent
centralized, independent review to determine
whether there was disease progression. PSA and biochemical bone markers were evaluated at Weeks 4, 8,
and 12 and every 12 weeks thereafter.
Any of the following events was indicative of disease progression: 1 or more new metastatic skeletal
lesions observed on bone scan; 1 or more new metastatic extraskeletal lesions at least 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension visible on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan; or an event attributed
to metastatic prostate cancer (eg, upper urinary tract
obstruction, spinal cord compression, pain) supported by radiographic, surgical, or pathologic evidence of disease. An increase in PSA was not
considered disease progression. An independent radiologist(s) read all radiographs, and an independent
oncologist(s) confirmed all disease progression
events: Independent reviewers were blinded to randomization status. Safety was assessed by review of
treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory test
results, and vital sign measurements.

Statistical Methods
TTP and PFS were the primary efficacy endpoints of
the study for regulatory agencies in the US and Europe, respectively. TTP was defined as the time from
randomization to onset of the earliest confirmed
event of disease progression. PFS was defined as the
time from randomization to the earliest onset of a
confirmed event of disease progression, grade 3 or 4
hypercalcemia within 7 days of the last dose of study
drug, or death within 42 days of the last available
evaluation. All events of disease progression were
confirmed by centralized, independent review. For
TTP, data were censored at the date of the last available evaluation in the absence of a confirmed event
of disease progression. For PFS, data were censored

Atrasentan in Nonmetastatic HRPC/Nelson et al

as described for TTP with the addition of a confirmed event of hypercalcemia or death.
Secondary efficacy endpoints were the time to
onset of PSA progression (TTPSA), the mean change
from baseline to final BALP value, PSA doubling
time, and survival (measured without censoring data
for subsequent treatments). TTPSA was defined as
the time from randomization to the first of 2 or
more consecutive postbaseline PSA measurements
obtained 14 days apart that were at least 50%
greater (minimum, 5 ng/mL increase) than the
patient’s PSA nadir. A patient’s PSA nadir was defined
as the smallest PSA value between his baseline and
postbaseline PSA values measured through study
drug dosing Day 105. Data for patients without PSA
progression were censored at the date of the last
postbaseline on-study or off-study PSA measurement
obtained no more than 7 days after the last study
drug dose. PSA doubling time was calculated by
using the formula (natural logarithm of 2)/slope of
the linear regression fit to natural logarithm of PSA
versus time (years) relative to the first dose of study
drug. PSA doubling times were categorized into the
following intervals: >0 to 0.25 years, >0.25 to 0.5
years, >0.5 to 0.75 years, >0.75 to 1 year, >1 to 1.5
years, >1.5 to 2 years, and >2 years.
Tertiary efficacy endpoints included time to the
first skeletal metastasis. All efficacy analyses were
performed on all randomized patients.
The distributions of all time-to-event endpoints
were estimated for each treatment group using
Kaplan-Meier
methodology,
and
comparisons
between treatment groups were performed using a
protocol-specified, weighted, log-rank G1,1 statistic18,19 stratified by region (US sites vs non-US sites)
and the Cox proportional hazards model. No stratification factors were used at randomization. For the
primary and secondary time-to-event endpoints, the
stratified G1,1 statistic was the primary statistic used
for comparisons between treatment groups. The
mean change from baseline to final value in biomarkers was calculated for each treatment group and
was compared using an analysis of covariance with
treatment group as the factor and baseline value as
the covariate. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel mean
score test was used to compare the rate of PSA rise,
as determined by PSA doubling time categories,
between treatment groups.
Safety was assessed for the following variables:
study drug exposure; incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, including deaths and other serious adverse events; laboratory data; and vital sign
measurements. The Fisher exact test was used to
compare the incidence of adverse events between

2481

treatment groups. Safety analyses included all
patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug.
Data from an earlier study in patients with metastatic HRPC were the basis of simulations indicating
the need to enroll 900 to 1000 patients to realize 650
events of disease progression and to attain 90%
power to detect a 25% difference in TTP. Because the
patient population in the current study had earlier
stage disease, we determined that 500 events of disease progression would provide 80% power to detect
a treatment difference using the log-rank test if the
hazards ratio in favor of atrasentan was 0.77. We
anticipated that 500 events of disease progression
would be achieved by May 31, 2006, the primary cutoff date for statistical analyses. The cutoff date for
data used in survival analyses was January 31, 2007.
Safety and efficacy data, summarized by treatment group, were reviewed by an independent datamonitoring committee during the course of the
study. The committee met on 6 occasions to assess
safety only and performed 2 formal interim analyses
of safety and efficacy. Interim efficacy analyses were
governed by a 1-sided, formal group sequential stopping rule,20 which was subject to constraints on the
maximum allowed boundary.21 Statistical significance
for all endpoints was determined by a 2-sided P
value .05.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between July 2001 and April 2003, 941 patients were
randomized at 75 investigational sites in the US and
at 108 investigational sites outside of the US. Demographic and baseline characteristics generally were
balanced between groups (Table 1). Figure 1 shows
the allocation of patients to the placebo (N 5 474) and
atrasentan (N 5 467) groups and patient disposition.
Efficacy
TTP and PFS endpoints were included to satisfy regulatory authorities in the US and Europe, respectively. Because the results for both endpoints were
similar, only those for TTP are presented here (Table
2). There was a 93-day delay in the median TTP with
atrasentan (764 days) compared with placebo (671
days), but the difference in the distribution was not
statistically significant (P 5 .288) (Fig. 2a). When the
data were analyzed by region (US vs non-US), it
became apparent that patients who were randomized
to receive treatment with atrasentan at sites in the
US had a shorter median TTP (590 days) than those
at non-US sites (847 days), whereas the median TTP
was similar for placebo patients across regions (US

(Fig. 2b).
Overall, a significantly greater percentage of
patients on atrasentan discontinued prematurely
(33.2% vs 25.9%; P 5 .015). Premature discontinuations were significantly more frequent at US sites
(40.8%) than at non-US sites (21.9%; P < .001). The
cumulative discontinuation rates for patients on atrasentan versus patients on placebo at US sites were
45.5% and 36%, respectively; whereas, at non-US
sites, the corresponding rates were 24.6% and 19.3%.
Adverse events were the most frequent primary explanation by investigators for premature discontinuations, and the percentage of patients on atrasentan
who discontinued for this reason was more than
twice that of the patients on placebo overall (15.8%

vs 7.4%, respectively) and by region (US sites: 20.9%
vs 9.5%, respectively; non-US sites: 12.3% vs 6%,
respectively). Although an increase in PSA was not
considered disease progression according to the protocol, differences between US sites and non-US sites
were noted in the mean PSA increase between the
penultimate and last visits and the mean PSA values
at the last visit for patients in both treatment groups
(Table 3). In all patients, the mean increase in PSA
and the mean PSA values were lower at US sites than
at non-US sites. Similar proportions of patients discontinued treatment for protocol-defined PSA progression between the 2 arms (atrasentan vs placebo:
2.6% vs 3%), but the discontinuation rate for PSA
progression at US sites was more than 4 times higher
than that for non-US sites (20 of 380 patients [5.3%]
vs 6 of 561 patients [1.1%]).
A greater percentage of patients on placebo
(56.3%) than patients on atrasentan (48.6%) had confirmed disease progression. New extraskeletal lesions
and metastatic prostate cancer events were cited as
the primary manifestation of disease progression by
similar percentages of patients on placebo (8% and
4%, respectively) and patients on atrasentan (8.8%
and 3.6%, respectively). However, new skeletal lesions
were cited as the primary reason for disease progression by a greater percentage of patients on placebo
(44.3%) than patients on atrasentan (36.2%). Treatment with atrasentan delayed the median time to
initial presentation with skeletal metastases by
approximately 250 days (1008 days for atrasentan vs

757 days for placebo), but the difference in the distribution was not statistically significant (P 5 .103).
The median TTPSA progression was similar for
the 2 groups (254 days for the atrasentan group vs
253 days for the placebo group; P 5 .240). The rate of
PSA rise, as measured by doubling time distribution,
was significantly slower for atrasentan than for placebo (P 5 .031). Atrasentan significantly attenuated
the rise in BALP from baseline to final assessment
(mean change: 21.51 ng/mL on atrasentan vs 12.21
ng/mL on placebo; P 5 .001).
The median survival was 1477 days on atrasentan and 1403 days on placebo in the ITT population
(hazards ratio, 0.919; 95% confidence interval, 0.7691.098) (Fig. 3). It is difficult to interpret results
regarding the possible effect of atrasentan on overall
survival, because the survival data were not censored
for subsequent treatment, and 54% of the patients
on placebo subsequently enrolled in the open-label
study and received atrasentan.

Safety
Common treatment-emergent adverse events that
were reported significantly more often with atrasentan included peripheral edema, nasal congestion,
headache, dyspnea, and anemia (P  .029). With placebo, these included constipation and hypertension
(P  .006) (Table 4). Most of these events reported
with atrasentan were grade 1 or 2 and resolved during the treatment period with or without the use of
ancillary medication. Generally, the median time to
onset of these events was within the initial 30 days;
the median time to onset of anemia was 225 days after starting treatment. Most important, there was no
evidence of cumulative toxicity. All these events had
been observed in patients who received atrasentan in
earlier clinical trials. Peripheral edema, nasal congestion, dyspnea, and headache are consistent with
the vasodilatory effects of ETA receptor blockade,
whereas anemia reflects an underlying mechanism of
plasma volume expansion resulting in hemodilution.
Initial decreases in hemoglobin at 2 weeks for atrasentan-treated patients were accompanied by
increases in weight and decreases in white blood cell
(WBC) and albumin concentrations, all suggestive of
volume expansion. After 2 weeks, hemoglobin, WBC,
and albumin levels stabilized, and the changes
paralleled those observed with placebo, both for
the duration of the study and after study drug
discontinuation.
A greater percentage of patients in the atrasentan
group (26.4%) than in the placebo group (16.4%)
experienced adverse events that resulted in discontinuation of study drug. Serious adverse events
occurred with similar frequency in both treatment

from serious adverse events also was similar between
the atrasentan group (3.5%) and the placebo group
(4.7%).
ET receptor antagonists, as a group, have demonstrated an increased incidence of cardiopulmonary
events that likely is related to their underlying
vasoactive mechanism. Heart failure was the only
cardiopulmonary event that occurred significantly
more frequently with atrasentan than with placebo
(6.7% vs 3%; P 5 .009) (Table 5). The median time to
onset of heart failure was 47 days (range, 7-506

events was low, and atrasentan-treated patients with
heart failure tended to be older and had a history of
significant cardiac disease compared with atrasentantreated patients who did not experience heart failure
(P  .05). No atrasentan-treated patient died from
heart failure or myocardial infarction. Aside from an
increased incidence of anemia in the atrasentan
group, there were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the treatment groups in
terms of hematology or laboratory data.

DISCUSSION
Despite a demonstration of atrasentan’s biologic activity in this randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational trial in patients with nonmetastatic HRPC,
confirming earlier observations of its effects on PSA
and biomarkers of bone disease, we were not able to
demonstrate a significant treatment difference in
TTP or survival. Treatment with atrasentan resulted
in a significantly slower rate of PSA rise, a significant
attenuation of BALP rise, and a trend toward a delay
in the time to initial presentation with skeletal metastases. Although more patients on atrasentan than
patients on placebo discontinued the study because
of adverse events, the safety profile of atrasentan was
consistent with that observed in earlier trials, primarily reflecting the vasodilatory effects of ETA receptor
blockade, without evidence of cumulative toxicity or
hematologic toxicity.
The obvious issue is why the effects of atrasentan on PSA, biomarkers of bone lesions, and the incidence of bone lesions did not translate into a
significant effect on the disease course and a delay
in TTP. Atrasentan did demonstrate a favorable pro-

patients. Discontinuation for reasons other than disease progression was notably high in this trial. Nearly
30% of all patients discontinued treatment prematurely, and the percentage of patients on atrasentan
that discontinued for reasons other than disease progression was significantly greater than the percentage
of patients on placebo. A high premature discontinuation rate was reported previously in a multicenter
trial that enrolled patients with nonmetastatic
HRPC.22 In that trial, from 33% of patients in both
treatment groups (placebo or sodium clodronate)
discontinued prematurely and did not complete the
5-year treatment regimen. The most frequently cited
reasons for premature discontinuation included
adverse events and patient choice.
In the current trial, premature discontinuations
were almost twice as frequent at US sites than at
non-US sites. Cumulative discontinuation rates were
higher for both treatment groups at US sites compared with non-US sites. Discontinuations because
of adverse events also were more frequent at US sites
and were more than twice as frequent among
patients on atrasentan in both regions.
Are these observations merely the result of
chance, or are they indicative of regional differences
in patient populations or physician practice patterns?
Regional differences in response were anticipated on
the basis of results from earlier studies with atrasentan. The regional differences for placebo patients in

both TTP and discontinuation rates were minimal,
suggesting that differences in patient populations in
the 2 regions were not a major factor. In contrast, a
shorter median duration of treatment was observed
for both treatment groups at US sites compared with
non-US sites. Regional differences in physician practice patterns may have contributed to observed differences in treatment duration. At US sites, a shorter
median duration of treatment was observed for both
treatment groups compared with non-US sites.
Another regional difference was in PSA levels at the
time of premature discontinuation. It is noteworthy
that, whereas the percentage of patients that discontinued prematurely because of PSA progression was
similar for both treatment groups overall, the mean
increase in PSA from the penultimate to the last visit
and the mean PSA value at the last visit were lower
at US sites than at non-US sites (Table 3). These data
suggest that physicians and/or patients were more
inclined toward premature discontinuation at US
sites than at non-US sites. Alternative treatment
options may have been more available at US sites,
but whether this contributed to differences in treatment duration or to the incidence of premature discontinuation is merely speculative.
The safety profile observed for atrasentan in this
trial was consistent with observations in previous
trials and its mechanism of action as a selective ETA
receptor antagonist. The overall incidence of cardiopulmonary events was low, and the only cardiopulmonary event that was significantly more common
in patients on atrasentan than in patients on placebo
was heart failure. Among atrasentan-treated patients,
those with heart failure tended to be older and had a
history of significant cardiac disease. The low incidence of hematologic toxicity observed with atrasentan treatment supports its use in combination with
chemotherapy agents that affect hematologic parameters, such as docetaxel.
Atrasentan treatment did demonstrate some biologic activity, as evidenced by its effects on biomarkers of disease progression. Significant differences
from placebo in PSA doubling time and changes in
BALP levels were observed with atrasentan treatment. Effects on bone lesions also were observed,
with a median delay of approximately 250 days in
initial presentation of skeletal metastases with atrasentan. Among patients with confirmed disease progression, fewer were treated with atrasentan (48.6%)
than with placebo (56.3%), and new skeletal metastases were cited as the primary disease progression
event in a smaller percentage of patients in the atrasentan arm (36.2%) than patients in the placebo arm
(44.3%). These observations of the effects of atrasen-

Atrasentan in Nonmetastatic HRPC/Nelson et al

tan on bone and bone markers were consistent with
preclinical findings and with reports from phase 2
and 3 clinical trials.15-17,23 The favorable effects of
atrasentan on PSA also were consistent with observations from other clinical trials.
The suggestion of biologic activity, especially relevant to bone metastases, and the acceptable safety
profile of atrasentan, particularly the lack of hematologic toxicity, warrant further evaluation of atrasentan, especially in combination with chemotherapy
agents in prospective, randomized, controlled trials.
Once such trial, sponsored by the Southwest Oncology
Group (SWOG-0421), is ongoing in patients who have
HRPC with bone metastases to evaluate the efficacy of
the combination of atrasentan and docetaxel.
