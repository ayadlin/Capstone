ABSTRACT:

The abnormal BCR-ABL oncoprotein is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase driving
aberrant proliferation of transformed hematopoietic cells. BCR-ABL regulates
activation of many mitogenic and pro-survival pathways, including the PI 3’K/AKT/
mTOR pathway that controls various effectors and regulates initiation of mRNA
translation in mammalian cells. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that
target the ABL kinase domain have remarkable clinical activity and have dramatically
changed the natural history of Ph+ leukemias, resistance to these agents also
develops via a wide range of mechanisms. Efforts to target the PI3’K/AKT/mTOR
signaling pathway using kinase inhibitors have been the focus of extensive ongoing
investigations by several research groups. Here we review the effects of activation
of the AMPK kinase, which regulates downstream targeting and inhibition of mTOR.
The potential for future clinical-translational applications of AMPK activators such
as AICAR, metformin and resveratrol for the treatment of chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML) and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are discussed.

BCR-ABL IN CHRONIC MYELOID
LEUKEMIA AND ITS TARGETING BY TKIs

CML and Ph+ ALL [8-13]. As this agent targets directly
the ABL kinase domain, its introduction in clinical
oncology provided a model for potential selective and
specific therapeutic interventions in other malignancies
with well-defined targets [11, 12]. Imatinib mesylate,
along with second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI) such as nilotinib and dasatinib [14-22], have
changed the natural history of CML and have provided
important treatment options for this leukemia that in the
past was uniformly fatal.
Despite such advances in the field, mutations
rendering CML and Ph+ ALL patients non-responsive to
TKI’s have been identified, including the threonine 315
to isoleucine (T315I) mutation and several others, which
differentially prevent binding of different TKIs to the
active site of the ABL kinase domain, thereby evading
inhibition [23]. Beyond mutations in the kinase domain
of BCR-ABL, additional mechanisms of resistance
exist [23, 24], further complicating the management of
such patients. Although identification of new molecular
markers may facilitate response prediction to TKIs
and allow optimization of their clinical use [25], there
is a need for the development of agents that overcome

Chronic Myeloid leukemia (CML) is defined
by the formation and presence of the Philadelphia
(Ph) chromosome, which results from the reciprocal
chromosomal translocation t(9;22) (q34;q11) [1, 2]. The
protein product of the abnormal Bcr-Abl fusion gene is
the oncoprotein BCR-ABL, which is expressed in CML
and Ph+ ALL [2, 3]. BCR-ABL retains the tyrosine
kinase ability of c-ABL but, contrary to c-ABL it is
constitutively localized in the cytoplasm, resulting in the
engagement and activation of multiple pro-proliferative
and anti-apoptotic cascades in transformed cells [2, 3].
Among the cellular cascades activated by BCR-ABL
there are mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
phosphatidyl inositol 3’ kinase/AKT/mammalian target of
rapamycin (PI3’K/AKT/ mTOR) pathways [4-7].
The identification of imatinib mesylate (STI-571;
Gleevec) as a small molecule ATP-pocket inhibitor of
BCR-ABL dramatically re-defined the treatment of CML
and had a major impact in the survival of patients with

BCR-ABL TKI resistance. This has led to the ongoing
clinical development of new TKIs such as bosutinib that
has activity against several imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL
mutants with the exception of T315I-BCR-ABL [26] and
ponatinib that has activity against T315I-BCR-ABL [28].
Beyond efforts to develop inhibitors that can overcome
resistance to first and second generation TKIs, another
approach of high potential value is the selective targeting
and inhibition of cellular effectors downstream of BCRABL. As discussed below, the PI 3’K/mTOR cascade is
a prime target for such purpose and has been the focus of
extensive investigations.

primary patient samples [47, 48] and in a mouse Ph+ ALL
mouse model [48], suggesting that these or other similar
agents with dual targeting capacities against TORC1 and
TORC2 may provide a new alternative approach for the
treatment of CML resistant to TKIs.

Effects of AMPK activation on BCR-ABLtransformed cells
Beyond agents that directly target and inhibit TORCs,
indirect suppression of mTOR function by modulation of
the AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) pathway may
provide an important alternative therapeutic approach
[50]. AMPK regulates mTOR signaling both directly and
indirectly. This heterotrimeric protein kinase is activated
by means of phosphorylation on the Thr172 site of the
α-subunit due to an increased AMP:ATP ratio [51]. Once
active, AMPK phosphorylates and activates the TSC2
subunit of the TSC1/2 complex, which in turn suppresses
Rheb activity, a small G-protein with regulatory functions
on mTOR activation [52-54]. In addition, AMPK has been
found to directly phosphorylate the Raptor subunit on
Ser792, resulting in inactivation of the TORC1 complex
[55].
In one of the initial studies in which the effects of
modulation of AMPK in ALL cells were assessed, the AMPanalog AMPK-activator compound 5-aminoimidazole4-carboxamide-1-beta-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR) was
shown to exert antiproliferative effects on childhood ALL
cells, including the SupB15 cell line which expresses the
p185 BCR-ABL fusion protein [56]. In that study AICAR
was found to induce phosphorylation of AMPKα on
Thr172, resulting in inhibition of proliferation and cellcycle arrest at the G1 phase, by increasing the levels of the
cell cycle regulators p53, p27 and p21 [56]. The effects of
AICAR were enhanced by combination with the mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin in all different ALL cell lines tested
in that study [56], while the growth inhibitory responses
were mediated in part by engagement of the p38 MAP
kinase pathway. Another study from the same group [57]
established that phosphorylation of AKT on Thr308 and
Ser473 increases following treatment of ALL cells with
AICAR and demonstrated that AKT phosphorylation on
Thr 308 is mediated by AMPK-induced IGF-1R activation
and phosphorylation of IRS-1. In follow-up experiments,
the authors of that work were able to demonstrate that
concomitant inhibition of IGF-1R activity using a tyrosine
kinase inhibitor and AMPK activation using AICAR
resulted in substantially enhanced antileukemic effects
[57].
Resveratrol, a naturally occurring substance found
in grapes, has been shown to modulate AMPK in BCRABL transformed cells and to exhibit antileukemic effects
[57-58]. Treatment of either imatinib mesylate-sensitive
or imatinib mesylate-resistant CML cells with resveratrol

HYPERACTIVATION OF THE PI3’K/AKT/
mTOR SIGNALING PATHWAY BY BCR-ABL
Among the multiple cellular cascades that are
activated by BCR-ABL, the PI3’K/AKT/mTOR pathway
[5, 28-30] is of particular interest and has been the subject
of extensive efforts by many groups in the CML and
Ph+ ALL research fields. One mechanism by which the
PI 3’K/mTOR pathway is engaged involves increased
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by BCRABL, leading to inhibition of the serine/threonine
phosphatase PP1α, a negative regulator of PI3’K/AKT,
ultimately resulting in hyper-activation of the pathway
[31, 32]. Blocking the PI3’K/AKT signaling in BCR-ABL
cells with the pharmacological inhibitor LY294002 results
in increased expression of the cell cycle regulator p27Kip1
[33] and decreased expression of VEGF and HIF1α [34].
Furthermore, combining pharmacological inhibition of
the PI3’ kinase with BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors such
imatinib mesylate results in enhanced anti-leukemic
effects in Ph+ cells in vitro [35].
Downstream of the PI3’K/AKT pathway, the
mTOR signaling cascade is also hyperactive in CML [5,
7, 36-38]. mTOR is a central regulatory element in the
control of mRNA translation in mammalian cells and
functions as the catalytic subunit/kinase for two distinct
protein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2 [39-45]. These
complexes differ by in the mTOR-binding partners that
they include, with TORC1 containing Raptor and TORC2
containing Rictor and mSin1 [39-45]. These complexes
regulate distinct cellular processes, with TORC1 being the
mediator of signals for initiation of mRNA translation and
protein synthesis and TORC2 promoting survival pathways
and cytoskeletal reorganization [39-45]. Previous studies
have established that TORC1 and TORC2 play critical
roles in growth and survival of BCR-ABL transformed
cells, including myeloid (CML) and lymphoid (Ph+
ALL) cells [36-38, 46-49], underscoring the importance
and relevance of the mTOR pathway in the pathogenesis
and pathophysiology of Ph+ malignancies. Notably, the
ATP-competitive dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors PP242 and
OSI-027 have shown potent growth inhibitory and proapoptotic effects in a number of BCR-ABL cell lines and

resulted in cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death [57].
Notably, among the resistant cells that were sensitive to
resveratrol, there were also cells expressing the T315I
BCR-ABL mutant [57]. Subsequent studies demonstrated
that resveratrol induces autophagic cell death in CML
cells by a dual mechanism involving both engagement
of AMPK and JNK-mediated overexpression of p62/
SQSTM1 [58].
In a recent study [59], we assessed whether
modulation of AMPK by AICAR and the FDA-approved
anti-diabetic drug metformin [60-62], exert suppressive
effects on BCR-ABL transformed cells. In that study
[59] we found that both AICAR and metformin induce
AMPK kinase activity, as reflected by phosphorylation of
ACC and TSC2. The phosphorylation of various effectors
downstream of mTOR was compromised upon treatment
in all cell lines tested, including cells harboring the T315I
mutation. These studies have indicated that the effects
of mTOR inhibition by AICAR and metformin occur
irrespectively of TKI-sensitivity [59] and further raised
the prospect of using AMPK activators in the treatment
of Ph+ leukemias refractory to TKIs, including CML and
Ph+ ALL.

introduction of imatinib mesylate, nilotinib and dasatinib
in the treatment of patients with Ph+ ALL has dramatically
improved their outcome. Nevertheless, large numbers of
patients eventually become unresponsive to treatment due
to mutations that occur either in the TKI-binding kinase
domain of BCR-ABL or due to the emergence of other
resistance mechanisms downstream of the kinase [24].
Approaches to target cellular effectors of BCR-ABL may
provide a complementary/enhancing approach to the
use of TKIs and/or help overcome resistance in cases of
resistant CML or Ph+ ALL. Importantly, modulation of
the AMPK pathway may allow targeting of mTOR in a
distinct, non-overlapping way, from mTOR inhibitors
and other suppressors of the PI3’K/AKT/mTOR cascade
and AMPK activators could be potentially combined with
PI 3’K/mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of refractory
myeloid leukemias. Notably, the anti-tumor effects of
metformin, a commonly used anti-diabetic drug, have been
observed in a number of other hematologic malignancies,
including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [63, 64] and
various solid tumors, including breast cancer, lung
cancer and others [50, 65-77], suggesting that the clinical
development of this drug in clinical oncology may offer
advantages for a variety of malignancies. In fact, efforts
to combine metformin with mTOR inhibitors for the
treatment of solid tumors are already underway [78] and
similar studies in Ph+ leukemias and other hematological
malignancies are probably warranted from the emerging
experimental evidence.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
There have been remarkable advances in the treatment
of CML over the last decade. With the introduction of first
and second generation TKIs in the treatment of CML,
the majority of patients achieve complete hematological,
cytogenetic and molecular responses [4, 12]. Also, the
