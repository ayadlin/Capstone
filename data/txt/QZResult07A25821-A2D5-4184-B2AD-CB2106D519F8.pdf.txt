Abstract
Posttranslational neddylation of cullins in the Cullin-Ring E3 ligase (CRL) complexes is needed for proteolytic
degradation of CRL substrates, whose accumulation induces cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. The
Nedd8-activating enzyme (NAE) is critical for neddylation of CRL complexes and their growth-promoting
function. Recently, the anticancer small molecule MLN4924 currently in phase I trials was determined to be an
inhibitor of NAE that blocks cullin neddylation and inactivates CRL, triggering an accumulation of CRL substrates
that trigger cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence in cancer cells. Here, we report that MLN4924 also triggers
autophagy in response to CRL inactivation and that this effect is important for the ability of MLN4924 to suppress
the outgrowth of liver cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. MLN4924-induced autophagy was attributed partially to
inhibition of mTOR activity, due to accumulation of the mTOR inhibitory protein Deptor, as well as to induction of
reactive oxygen species stress. Inhibiting autophagy enhanced MLN4924-induced apoptosis, suggesting that
autophagy is a survival signal triggered in response to CRL inactivation. In a xenograft model of human liver
cancer, MLN4924 was well-tolerated and displayed a signiﬁcant antitumor effect characterized by CRL inactivation and induction of autophagy and apoptosis in liver cancer cells. Together, our ﬁndings support the clinical
investigation of MLN4924 for liver cancer treatment and provide a preclinical proof-of-concept for combination
therapy with an autophagy inhibitor to enhance therapeutic efﬁcacy. Cancer Res; 72(13); 3360–71. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Liver cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is
one of the most common human malignancies and the third
leading cause of cancer death worldwide with 600,000 deaths
per year (1). Moreover, liver cancer is annually diagnosed in
more than half a million people worldwide. Although surgical

motherapies when necessary, represent curative treatments
for early or localized disease, approximately 80% of patients
with liver cancer with advanced disease are not permissible to
surgical resection or transplantation and have to mainly rely on
traditional chemotherapies (2). However, the current chemotherapy is far from satisfaction due to relatively low anticancer
efﬁcacy, severe treatment-associated adverse effects, as well as
acquired drug resistance, leading to high risk of tumor recurrence and poor long-term survival. The dilemma makes an
urgent necessity to identify novel anticancer targets and
develop new therapeutic agents with efﬁcient and selective
anticancer efﬁcacy to improve the treatment of liver cancer.
The Cullin-Ring ligases (CRL), also known as SKP1-Cullin-Fbox (SCF) E3 ligases for its founding member (3), are the largest
multiunit ubiquitin ligase family in cells. CRL/SCF E3 ligases
(CRL/SCF) are in charge of the degradation of about 20% of
ubiquitinated cellular proteins to regulate diverse biologic
processes (4, 5), whereas its dysfunction leads to carcinogenesis. Recently, CRL/SCF is identiﬁed as a promising anticancer
target based on the following ﬁndings (6, 7): (i) Some essential
components of CRL/SCF such as F-box protein SKP2 (8, 9) and
RING-ﬁnger protein RBX1/ROC1 serve as oncoproteins and are
speciﬁcally overexpressed in human cancers (10); (ii) Knockdown of these oncogenic proteins via siRNA silencing significantly suppresses cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo (10,
11); and (iii) Inactivation of CRL/SCF via small-molecule

Anti-Liver Cancer Activity by MLN4924

inhibitors, such as MLN4924, showed striking anticancer efﬁcacy with good tolerance (4, 12).
Neddylation, a process of adding ubiquitin-like molecule
Nedd8 to target proteins, is a new type of protein posttranslational modiﬁcation (13). The reaction involves the successive
action of Nedd8-activating enzyme E1 (NAE), Nedd8-conjugating enzyme E2 (Ubc12), and NEDD8-E3 ligase (13). Intensive
studies showed that the activation of CRL/SCF requires neddylation modiﬁcation of its essential subunit Cullin (4). Recently, MLN4924, a speciﬁc inhibitor of NAE, was discovered via a
high-throughput screening (4, 14). Because of its signiﬁcant
anticancer efﬁcacy in preclinical studies, MLN4924 has been
advanced into several phase I clinical trials for several solid
tumors and hematologic malignancies (15). In mechanism,
MLN4924 inhibits NAE activities by binding to NAE at the
active site to form a covalent Nedd8-MLN4924 adduct (16). As a
result, cullin neddylation is blocked and CRL/SCF is inactivated. By doing so, MLN4924 causes accumulation of a mass of
CRL/SCF E3 substrates (4, 17, 18), which triggers DNA rereplication stress and DNA damage response (DDR), as well as
induces abnormal cell-cycle progression, apoptosis, and/or
senescence to suppress the growth of cancer cells in vitro and
in vivo (4, 12, 19–23). Recent accumulated data suggested that
autophagy may be involved in the induction of apoptosis or
senescence upon cellular stresses (24). However, it is completely unknown whether MLN4924 regulates autophagy response
upon CRL/SCF inactivation. Moreover, the efﬁcacy of this ﬁrstin-class agent on liver cancer still remains elusive. In this study,
we showed a signiﬁcant therapeutic efﬁcacy of MLN4924 on
liver cancer in vitro and in vivo by modulating autophagy and
apoptosis pathways, which provides proof-of-concept evidence for the clinical investigation of this ﬁrst-in-class anticancer agent in the treatment of liver cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, culture, and reagents
Human liver cancer cell lines Huh-7 and Hep G2 were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and
cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (Hyclone),
containing 10% FBS (Biochrom AG) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution, at 37 C with 5% CO2. MLN4924 was synthesized as previously described (25). For in vitro studies,
MLN4924 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
kept in 20 C. For in vivo studies, MLN4924 was dissolved in
10% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (HPBCD), and the solution of MLN4924 was freshly made every week and stored in
dark at room temperature before use.
siRNA knockdown of Deptor, ATG5, and Beclin 1
Liver cancer cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides made by GenePharma using Lipofectamine 2000. The
sequences of siRNAs are as follows: for Deptor (26), siDeptor-1:
50 -GCCATGACAATCGGAAATCTA-30 , siDeptor-2: 50 -GCAAGGAAGACATTCACGATT-30 ; for ATG5 (27), siATG5: 50 -CAUCUGAGCUACCCGGAUAUU-30 ; for Beclin 1 (28), siBeclin 1: 50 CAGUUUGGCACAAUCAAUATT-30 ; and for control scrambled
siRNA, siControl: 50 -UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-30 .

Immunoblotting
Cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting, using antibodies against Wee1, Cullin1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p21,
total CHK2 (t-CHK2), total H2A (t-H2A; Epitomics, Inc.),
mTOR, p-4E-BP1 (T37/46), NonP-4E-BP1, p-CHK2 (T68), pH2A (Ser139), p27, Atg5, Atg7, Beclin 1, cleaved caspase-3,
cleaved PARP, p-Histone H3 (Ser10; Cell Signaling) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), LC3, and
Deptor (Sigma).
Cell counting and clonogenic assay
For cell counting, cells were seeded into 24-well plates with
1  104 cells per well. Cells were trypsinized, resuspended, and
counted with Cellometer Auto T4 (Nexcelom Bioscience) at
indicated time points. For clonogenic assay, cells were seeded
into a 60-mm dish with 500 cells per well and cultured for 10
days. The colonies on the dish were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. The colonies with more
than 50 cells were counted.
Propidium iodide staining and ﬂuorescence-activated
cell-sorting analysis
Cells treated with MLN4924 or DMSO were harvested
and ﬁxed in 70% ethanol at 20 C overnight, and stained
with propidium iodide (PI; 36 mg/mL; Sigma) containing
RNase (10 mg/mL; Sigma) at 37 C for 15 minutes, then
analyzed for apoptosis and cell-cycle proﬁle by CyAn ADP
(Beckman Coulter; ref. 10). Apoptosis was measured by the
percentage of cells in sub-G1 population. Data were analyzed with ModFit LT software. The activation of caspase-3
was determined by CaspGLOW Fluorescein Active Caspase3 Staining Kit (BioVision) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Establishment of Huh-7-EGFP-LC3 and Hep G2-EGFPLC3 cell lines
Huh-7 and Hep G2 cells, stably expressing EGFP-LC3
fusion protein, were established as described (29, 30). Brieﬂy,
cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with 3 mg
pEGFP-LC3 plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Cells with enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP) ﬂuorescence were selected by MoFloXDP Cell Sorter (Beckman
Coulter) and cultured in complete cell culture medium
containing G418 at 200 mg/mL. The autophagy induced by
MLN4924 was measured by appearance of punctate vesicle
structure and photographed under a ﬂuorescence microscope (Leica).
Acridine orange staining
Quantiﬁcation of autophagy by acridine orange staining was
conducted as described (31). Brieﬂy, cells treated with or
without MLN4924 at 0.1 mmol/L for 24 hours were trypsinized
and stained with 1 mmol/L acridine orange in PBS containing
5% FBS at 37 C for 15 minutes. Cells were washed, resuspended, and subjected to FACS assays. Green (510–530 nm)
and red (650 nm) ﬂuorescence emission from cells illuminated
with blue (488 nm) excitation light was measured by CyAn ADP
(Beckman Coulter).

Cell growth assay with CELL-IQ cell-culturing platform
CELL-IQ was conducted as described (32). Brieﬂy, the cell
number was measured by the real-time cell monitoring system,
using a Cell-IQ cell-culturing platform (Chip-Man Technologies). To determine cell number of each stage during proliferation, Huh-7 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (1  104 cells
per well) overnight and then treated with or without MLN4924
at 0.1 mmol/L. Images of each microscopic ﬁeld were captured
at 50-minute intervals for 100 hours. Cell-IQ system automatically calculated total cell number of each image. Each group
contained 12 replicate microscopic ﬁelds.
In vivo antitumor effect of MLN4924
Orthotopic xenograft model of liver cancer was established
by AntiCancer Biotech as described (33). Brieﬂy, Hep G2-GFP
human liver cancer tissue that originated from subcutaneous
tumor of nude mice was harvested and carefully inspected to
remove necrotic tissue. The harvested tumor tissue was then
equally divided into small pieces of 1 mm3 each. One 1-mm
piece of the above tumor tissue fragments was inserted into
the incision on the left lobe of liver of each mouse. The
tumor-bearing mice were randomized into 2 groups (10 animals/group) and treated with 10% HPBCD or MLN4924
(30 mg/kg, s.c.), twice a day respectively, on a 3-days-on/
2-days-off schedule for 7 cycles within total 35 days (4). The
size of tumors was measured by whole body ﬂuorescence
imaging system twice a week, as described (30, 34). Brieﬂy,
whole body imaging of tumor-bearing animals was conducted
with an Olympus OV100 imaging system with 470 nm excitation light originating from an MT-20 light source. Emitted
ﬂuorescence was collected through appropriate ﬁlters conﬁgured on a ﬁlter wheel with a DP70 CCD camera, and images
were captured with a PC and processed for contrast and
brightness with Paint Shop Pro 8 and CellR (34). At the end
of the study, the serum of animals was collected for biochemical assays with Modular DDP (Roche), followed by sacriﬁce of
animals. Then, tumor tissues of mice were collected, photographed, and weighed. Parts of tumor tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer with tissue tearor for 1 minute, and
centrifuged at 10,000  g at 4 C for 5 minutes to collect the
supernatant for immunoblotting.
Statistical analysis
The statistical signiﬁcance of differences between groups
was assessed using the GraphPad Prism5 software. The
unpaired 2-tailed t test was used for the comparison of parameters between groups. The level of signiﬁcance was set at
P < 0.05.

Results
MLN4924 inhibited the growth of liver cancer cells
To evaluate the efﬁcacy of MLN4924 on liver cancer cells,
Huh-7 cells carrying mutated and inactivated p53 and Hep G2
cells expressing wild-type and functional p53 were treated with
MLN4924 and subjected to cell growth analysis. As shown
in Fig. 1, MLN4924 completely inhibited cullin neddylation (Fig.
1A) and signiﬁcantly suppressed the proliferation of Huh-7 and

3362

Cancer Res; 72(13) July 1, 2012

Hep G2 cells, regardless of p53 status (Fig. 1B). MLN4924 also
notably suppressed cell clonogenic survival in these cells (Fig.
1C). Moreover, we applied a real-time cell monitoring system
using a Cell-IQ cell culture platform to kinetically measure cell
growth over time. As shown in Fig. 1D (left), MLN4924-treated
Huh7 cells only underwent slow replication for limited generations, whereas control cells proliferated rapidly and reached
100% conﬂuence in cell culture dish at 100 hours after treatment. Consistently, the cell growth curve generated by Cell-IQ
monitoring system showed signiﬁcantly inhibitory effect of
MLN4924 on treated cells (Fig. 1D, right). Similar results using
Cell-IQ monitoring system were obtained in Hep G2 cells (data
not shown). These ﬁndings showed a striking inhibitory effect
of MLN4924 on the growth of liver cancer cells.
MLN4924 induced G2 cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in
liver cancer cells
Previous studies reported that MLN4924 inactivates
CRL/SCF, induces DDR (4, 12, 19–23), triggers cell-cycle
disturbance, apoptosis, and/or senescence to suppress cancer cell growth. Similarly, we found that MLN4924 induced
DDR in Huh-7 and Hep G2 cells, as shown by the appearance
of phosphorylated H2A and CHK2, 2 classical markers of
DDR (Fig. 2A). During the treatment, p21 and p27, 2 wellknown CRL/SCF substrates (6, 21), accumulated notably
(Fig. 2A), further indicating efﬁcient inactivation of CRL/
SCF by MLN4924.
Further analysis of cell-cycle proﬁle and apoptosis
revealed that MLN4924 triggered G2–M cell-cycle arrest,
followed by apoptosis in liver cancer cells (Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S1). MLN4924-induced G2–M cell-cycle
arrest reached the peak at 24 hours after treatment and then
decreased over time (Fig. 2B), whereas apoptosis appeared at
48 hours after treatment and continued to increase over
time (Fig. 2B for sub-G1 peak and Fig. 2C for caspase-3 and
PARP activation). These data suggest that arrested cells die
of apoptosis at late stage.
To determine at which phase MLN4924-treated cells were
arrested, we detected the expression status of Wee1, a welldeﬁned CRL/SCF substrate and an inhibitor of G2–M phase
transition (35), as well as p-Histone H3 (p-H3, ser10), a hallmark of M phase cells (36). As shown in Fig. 2C, Wee1
signiﬁcantly accumulated, whereas p-Histone H3 sharply
decreased upon MLN4924 treatment (Fig. 2C), indicating that
MLN4924-treated cells were arrested at the G2 and failed to
enter M-phase.
MLN4924 induced autophagy in liver cancer cells
Although MLN4924 frequently affects cell-cycle progression
and apoptosis, it is totally unknown whether it regulates
autophagy pathway. To address this, we ﬁrst determined the
effect of MLN4924 on the formation of autophagosome membrane via detection of the conversion of LC3 I (microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3) to lipidated LC3 II, as well as
via classical punctuative distribution of membrane-associated
LC3 II, 2 classical hallmarks of autophagy (37, 38). As shown
in Fig. 3A and B, MLN4924 indeed induced the conversion of
LC3 I to LC3 II, showed by the increasing accumulation of LC3

Furthermore, we conducted cell staining with acridine orange
which detects the formation of acidic vesicular organelle
(AVO), a characteristic of autophagy (37, 38). The results
showed that MLN4924 treatment induced AVO accumulation
signiﬁcantly (Fig. 3C), suggesting autophagy induction. Finally,

www.aacrjournals.org

we detected the appearance of double-membraned autophagosome, which contains engulfed bulk cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles, as golden hallmark of autophagy (37, 38) by
transmission electronic microscopy in treated cells. As shown
in Fig. 3D, the double-membraned autophagosome could be
easily observed in MLN4924-treated but not in control cells.
Taken together, these results convincingly showed that
MLN4924 induced autophagy in cancer cells.

MLN4924-induced autophagy is partially attributed to
mTOR inactivation by Deptor accumulation and to
reactive oxygen species stress
Considering that MLN4924 exerts its effects by inactivating
CRL/SCF and leading to accumulation of its substrates, we ﬁrst
searched for CRL/SCF substrates whose accumulation may
affect autophagy pathways. Most recently, we characterized an
mTOR-inhibitory protein Deptor (26) as a novel substrate of
CRL/SCF (39–41). Because inhibition of mTOR activity induces
autophagy response, we hypothesized that CRL/SCF inactivation by MLN4924 would block Deptor degradation, causing its

3364

Cancer Res; 72(13) July 1, 2012

accumulation, and thus inhibiting mTOR activity to trigger
autophagy. Indeed, we found that MLN4924 blocked the turnover of Deptor and led to its accumulation in both Huh-7 and
Hep G2 cells (Fig. 4A). The accumulation of Deptor by
MLN4924 resulted in a remarkable decrease in phosphorylated
4E-BP1 [p-4E-BP1 (T37/46)], which was coupled with remarkable increase in nonphosphorylated 4E-BP1 (NonP-4E-BP1).
Because 4E-BP1 is phosphorylated by mTOR and p-4E-BP1
serves as a marker of mTOR activation (39), signiﬁcant
decrease in p-4E-BP1 after MLN4924 treatment indicated
mTOR inactivation (Fig. 4A). Consistently, rapamycin, a

well-known small-molecule inhibitor of mTOR, also decreased
p-4E-BP1 and triggered autophagy in these cells (data not
shown).
To determine whether Deptor accumulation contributed to
autophagy response upon CRL/SCF inactivation directly, the
expression of Deptor in MLN4924-treated cells was downregulated via siRNA silencing (Fig. 4B). As a result, Deptor
knockdown signiﬁcantly restored the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 after MLN4924 treatment and attenuated the conversion
of LC3 I to LC3 II in liver cancer cells, especially in Hep G2 cells
(Fig. 4B). However, we found that Deptor siRNA silencing could
not fully block the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II upon CRL/SCF
inactivation (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Deptor accumulation is
necessary but not sufﬁcient to MLN4924-triggered autophagy.
Recently, it was reported that MLN4924 enhances the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induces ROS
stress in cancer cells (20, 42). Considering that ROS stress
could serve as a potential trigger of autophagy (42), we determined whether MLN4924-induced autophagy in liver cancer

www.aacrjournals.org

cells is also attributed to ROS stress by adding N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC), a classical ROS scavenger, to cell culture medium (43).
As the result, NAC signiﬁcantly blocked the conversion of LC3 I
to LC3 II induced by MLN4924 in both Huh-7 and Hep G2 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that ROS stress may be
involved in autophagy response upon CRL/SCF inactivation.
Autophagy occurred prior to apoptosis and played an
antiapoptotic role during MLN4924 treatment
The elucidation of the cross-talk between autophagy and
apoptosis, 2 programmed cellular responses against unfavorable stresses, has become an important object for effective
cancer treatment (24). Here, we ﬁrst determined which happening ﬁrst occurred upon MLN4924 treatment, autophagy or
apoptosis. To address this, the kinetics of autophagy and
apoptosis responses upon treatment was evaluated by calculating the percentage of cells displaying punctuative distribution of EGFP-LC3 for autophagy and sub-G1 phase distribution

Figure 4. MLN4924-induced
autophagy was partially attributed
to Deptor accumulation. A, Deptor
accumulation and mTOR pathway
inactivation by MLN4924. Cells
were treated with MLN4924 at 0.1
mmol/L for indicated time, followed
by IB analysis to probe indicated
proteins with GADPH as a loading
control. B, attenuation of
MLN4924-induced autophagy by
DeptorsiRNA silencing. Cells were
transfected with siRNA targeting
Deptor (siDeptor) or scrambled
control siRNA (siCont) for 48 hours
and subjected to MLN4924
treatment at 0.1 mmol/L for 72
hours, followed by IB analysis
using indicated antibodies with
GADPH as a loading control.

autophagy started to occur as early as 24 hours after MLN4924
treatment, whereas apoptosis started to appear at 48 hours
upon treatment in both Huh-7 and Hep G2 cells. Once initiated,
both autophagy and apoptosis continued to increase over time
and reached the peak at 96 hours after treatment (Fig. 5A and
B). The ﬁndings suggested that autophagy and apoptosis occur
sequentially in liver cancer cells upon MLN4924 exposure.
To further determine the effect of autophagy response on
apoptosis induction, we ﬁrst tried to block the autophagy
pathway via siRNA silencing of autophagy genes ATG5 and
Beclin 1 and evaluated its effect on apoptosis. As shown in Fig.
5C, partial blockage of autophagy by siRNA knockdown of
ATG5 and Beclin 1 enhanced apoptosis response upon
MLN4924 treatment, as measured by caspase-3 activation in
Hep G2 cells. To further conﬁrm the result, we ﬁrst used a pair
of mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast (MEF) cells, MEF-Atg5-WT
(autophagy-competent) versus MEF-Atg5-KO (autophagydeﬁcient) cells. As shown in Fig. 5D, MLN4924 induced autophagy response only in MEF-Atg5-WT but not in MEF-Atg5-KO
cells (Fig. 5D). Moreover, apoptosis could be obviously induced
by MLN4924 even at a lower concentration (1 mmol/L) in
autophagy-deﬁcient Atg5-KO but not autophagy-competent
Atg5-WT cells. Moreover, the intensity of apoptosis activation
in autophagy-deﬁcient cells was much stronger than that in
autophagy-competent cells upon MLN4924 treatment at any
dose (1–10 mmol/L; Fig. 5D). Similar result was obtained from
autophagy-deﬁcient Atg7-KO MEF cells (Supplementary Fig.

3366

S3). These ﬁndings suggest that autophagy response induced
by MLN4924 plays an antiapoptotic role.
MLN4924 suppressed tumor growth in vivo by inducing
autophagy and apoptosis
Having established that MLN4924 suppressed the growth
of liver cancer cells by modulating autophagy and apoptosis
in vitro, we next evaluated the in vivo antitumor activity of
MLN4924 and elucidated potential mechanisms. MLN4924
was administered to Hep G2-GFP orthotopic xenografts, and
the kinetic growth of tumors was monitored via a ﬂuorescence-based imaging system (34). As shown in Fig. 6A and B,
MLN4924-treated tumors progressed slowly, whereas control tumors grew rapidly over time, as shown by representative kinetic images of tumors (Fig. 6A) and tumor growth
curve (Fig. 6B, n ¼ 10). At the end point of MLN4924
treatment (35th day), tumors of both treated and control
groups were collected, imaged (Fig. 6C), and weighed (Fig.
6D). As shown in Fig. 6C, the size of control tumors was
much larger than that of MLN4924-treated tumors. Consistently, the weight of control tumors was signiﬁcantly higher
than that of treated tumors (Fig. 6D). During the whole
treatment, no obvious treatment-related toxicity against
body weight, liver function, and kidney function of animals
was observed (Fig. 6E and Supplementary Fig. S4). These
ﬁndings showed that MLN4924 has impressive anti-liver
cancer activity in vivo and is well tolerated in mice.

Anti-Liver Cancer Activity by MLN4924

Figure 5. Autophagy occurred
before apoptosis and prevented cells
from apoptosis induced by
MLN4924. A and B, autophagy
occurred before apoptosis. Huh7EGFP-LC3 or Hep G2-EGFP-LC3
cells seeded in 24-well plates with
4
1  10 cells per well were cultured
overnight and treated with or without
MLN4924 at 0.1 mmol/L for indicated
time. Autophagy was evaluated by
appearance of punctate vesicle
structure with ﬂuorescence
microscope (A), whereas apoptosis
was evaluated by cell populations in
sub-G1 phase with PI staining and
FACS (B). C, blocking of autophagy
pathway by ATG5 and Beclin 1 siRNA
silencing ampliﬁed MLN4924induced apoptosis. Cells were
transferred with siRNAs against
ATG5 and Beclin 1 or control for
48 hours, and then treated with
MLN4924 at 0.1 mmol/L for 96 hours.
Finally, cells were subjected to
caspase-3 activation assays, as
described in Materials and Methods.
D, MLN4924 induced more
apoptosis in MEF-Atg5-KO
compared with MEF-Atg5-WT.
Paired MEFs (Atg5-WT vs. Atg5-KO)
were treated with MLN4924 at
indicated concentrations for
48 hours, followed by IB analysis with
indicated antibodies.

To explore the in vivo anticancer mechanism of MLN4924,
we extracted proteins from treated and control tumors and
determined the inactivation status of CRL/SCF and the
induction of autophagy and apoptosis. As shown in Fig.
6F, MLN4924 signiﬁcantly inhibited cullin neddylation and
led to accumulation of CRL/SCF substrates p21 and p27,
indicating the efﬁcient inactivation of CRL/SCF in vivo after
treatment. Consistently, MLN4924 induced autophagy as
shown by the accumulation of Deptor and conversion of
LC3 I to LC3 II. Meanwhile, it triggered apoptosis as shown
by enhanced activation of PARP and caspase-3 in treated
tumors. Taken together, these ﬁndings showed that

MLN4924 exploited the similar anticancer mechanisms in
vitro and in vivo.

Discussion
Liver cancer, one of the most common human malignancies
with high recurrence rate and poor long-term survival (2), calls
for novel therapeutic agents with high efﬁcacy and low toxicity.
Recently, CRL/SCF has been recognized as a promising anticancer target (6, 7). The effort to discover small-molecule
inhibitors against CRL/SCF led to the discovery of MLN4924
(4). MLN4924 functions as a speciﬁc inhibitor of NAE and

Figure 6. MLN4924 suppressed the growth of orthotopic xenograft model of liver cancer by modulating autophagy and apoptosis. A–B, MLN4924 inhibited
tumor growth measured by ﬂuorescence imaging system. Nude mice bearing liver cancer xenografts with Hep G2-GFP cells were administrated with
MLN4924 at 30 mg/kg s.c. twice daily on a 3-days-on/2-days-off schedule for 7 cycles. Tumor size was monitored twice a week with ﬂuorescence imaging
system (A). The data were converted to tumor growth curves by ModFit LT software (B). C and D, MLN4924 signiﬁcantly reduced tumor volume. Mice were
sacriﬁced at 35th day after treatment (the end of study, n ¼ 10). Tumor tissues of mice were collected, photographed (C), and weighed (D; P < 0.001).
E, no obvious toxicity against body weight and liver function was observed during MLN4924 treatment. Body weight of animals was measured twice a week
during the treatment (E, top). At the end of the study, mice were sacriﬁced, and the serum was collected for biochemical assays. Liver function of
treated mice was determined by measuring the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) as described in Material
and Methods. NS, no signiﬁcance. F, MLN4924 induced autophagy and apoptosis in vivo. Tumor tissues were collected and homogenized in lysis
buffer with tissue tearor for 1 minute, then centrifuged at 10,000  g at 4 C for 5 minutes. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used for IB analysis with

blocks cullin neddylation, which is required for CRL/SCF
activity (4). Because of its promising anticancer efﬁcacy in
preclinical studies, MLN4924 has been advanced to phase I
clinical trials as a novel class of anticancer agents (15). In this
preclinical study, we showed the signiﬁcant anticancer effect of
MLN4924 on liver cancer both in vitro and in vivo by inducing
autophagy and apoptosis upon CRL/SCF inactivation.
Previous studies, including ours, showed that MLN4924
inhibits cullin neddylation, inactivates CRL/SCF, and stabilizes
CRL/SCF substrates, such as DNA replication licensing proteins Cdt1 and Orc1, induces DDR, leading to S-phase cell-cycle

arrest and cell death via apoptosis and/or senescence in solid
tumor cells (4, 12, 19–23). In addition, it was recently reported
that MLN4924 could induce the dramatic accumulation of
CRL/SCF substrate IkB-a and trigger G1 phase arrest in NFkB–dependent activated B-cell (ABC) lymphoma cells in which
little DNA rereplication was observed in treated cells (12). In
present study, however, we found that in both Huh-7 and Hep
G2 liver cancer cells, MLN4924 triggered DDR and cell-cycle
arrest at G2 phase, but not S-phase or G1 phase, which was
consistent with our recent ﬁnding that inactivation of CRL/
SCF via siRNA silencing of RBX1/ROC1, a CRL/SCF essential

Anti-Liver Cancer Activity by MLN4924

component, triggered G2 phase arrest as a result of activating
DNA damage checkpoint in multiple cancer cells (44).
Interestingly, inactivation of CRL/SCF via either MLN4924
treatment or RBX1/ROC1 siRNA silencing led to signiﬁcant
accumulation of CRL/SCF substrate Wee1, which serves as an
inhibitor of cell entry from G2 into M phase (35). Taken
together, these ﬁndings suggested that different cell-cycle
arrest induced by MLN4924 in different cell lines may result
from the accumulation of different CRL/SCF substrates in cell
line–dependent manner.
Another novel ﬁnding of this study is that MLN4924 induced
autophagy as a cellular response while it triggered cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis in liver cancer cells both in vitro and in
vivo. Actually, we found that MLN4924 also triggered autophagy response in other multiple human cancer cell lines,
including H1299 lung cancer cells, U87 glioblastoma cells, and
Hela cervical cancer cells (data not shown). Moreover, we
found that inactivation of CRL/SCF via siRNA silencing of its
essential component RBX1/ROC1 triggered autophagy in a
broad spectrum of cancer cells as well (unpublished data).
These ﬁndings indicate that autophagy is a general phenomenon to CRL/SCF inactivation, induced either by small-molecule inhibitors (such as MLN4924) or by siRNA silencing of its
essential components (such as RBX1/ROC1).
In terms of mechanism, MLN4924-induced autophagy could
be partially attributed to the accumulation of mTOR-inhibitory
protein Deptor (26). Three recent studies, including ours,
identiﬁed Deptor as a novel substrate of SCFbTrCP E3 ubiquitin
ligase and the stabilization of Deptor by SCFbTrCP inactivation could inhibit mTOR activity (39–41). Thus, it is anticipated that pharmacologic inhibition of CRL/SCF activity by
MLN4924 triggered autophagy owing to Deptor accumulation
and subsequent mTOR inactivation. Meanwhile, ROS stress
seemed to be also involved in MLN4924-triggered autophagy,
as ROS scavenger NAC could signiﬁcantly block autophagy
response upon MLN4924 treatment. Most recently, several
hundreds of new potential CRL/SCF substrates have been
identiﬁed in MLN4924-treated cells via high-throughput
proteomic approaches (17, 18, 45, 46). Some of these potential
CRL/SCF substrates, such as autophagy/Beclin-1 regulator
1 (Ambra1), may also be accumulated upon CRL/SCF inactivation and contribute to autophagy response directly (18, 47).
Thus, MLN4924 probably induces autophagy response by
modulating several signaling pathways, which are regulated
by different CRL/SCF substrates. Further studies by evaluating
the effect of high-throughput siRNA silencing of potential SCF
substrates on autophagy induction upon MLN4924 treatment
should be helpful to address this issue.
As an important cellular response, autophagy plays a key
role in the regulation of cell survival during diverse stresses.
Some studies show that autophagy serves as a prosurvival
mechanism against unfavorable conditions, whereas others
show that autophagy can cause cell death (known as type II
programmed cell death; 48, 49). The reason for this obvious
discrepancy about the role of autophagy in regulating cell
survival is rather complex, and may be attributed to many
factors, such as the type of cellular stresses, the time and extent
of autophagy induction, as well as cell lines used (48, 49). In this

www.aacrjournals.org

study, MLN4924-induced autophagy was a survival signal, and
blockage of autophagy pathway enhanced cell apoptosis. Consistently, we found that inactivation of CRL/SCF by RBX1/
ROC1 siRNA silencing also triggered autophagy, which played a
prosurvival and antiapoptotic role in liver cancer cells (unpublished data). The ﬁndings showed that the pharmaceutical or
genetic inhibition of CRL/SCF activity triggers protective
autophagy responses, and blockage of autophagy may serve
as a promising strategy to enhance MLN4924-induced suppression of cancer cell growth by amplifying apoptosis.
Furthermore, we showed in vivo anticancer effects of
MLN4924 using a physiologically relevant orthotopic xenograft
model of liver cancer. As it worked in vitro, MLN4924 significantly inhibited cullin neddylation, inactivated CRL/SCF
activity, leading to the accumulation of CRL/SCF substrates
(such as p21, p27, and Deptor) in vivo. Importantly, mechanism
analysis revealed that MLN4924 induced both autophagy and
apoptosis in tumors, suggesting that MLN4924 worked via
similar mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. Encouragingly,
MLN4924 treatment was well-tolerated in mice during entire
experimental periods. The high safety of MLN4924 should be
attributed to its improved selectivity as MLN4924 only blocks
the degradation of a speciﬁc subset of substrates regulated by
CRL/SCF (4, 15). In contrast, the ﬁrst and only U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib blocks the degradation of all substrates regulated
by ubiquitin-proteasome system, resulting in severe general
toxicity (50).
Our ﬁndings from this study can be summarized as follows:
MLN4924 induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in p53-independent manner to inhibit liver cancer cell growth. During the
process, it also triggers prosurvival autophagy response mainly
by Deptor accumulation. The blockage of autophagy pathway
sensitizes liver cancer to MLN4924-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7).
Moreover, MLN4924 displayed striking in vivo antitumor

for enhanced cancer cell killing.
