BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS) have limited therapeutic options. Sorafenib (BAY
43-9006) is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 (VEGFR1)
through 3, platelet-derived growth factor B, fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, and c-kit, and some of these may be relevant
in STS. METHODS: The authors tested sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in patients with advanced vascular
sarcoma (VS), high-grade liposarcomas, and leiomyosarcomas who had received 0 or 1 previous regimens for
advanced disease. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were accrued to the study, and 37 were evaluable for toxicity and
response. There were no unexpected side effects and no confirmed responses. The median progression-free survival
was 3 months, and the median overall survival was 17 months. Six of 8 patients in the VS cohort had prolonged clinical benefit (stable disease or better), resulting in a median progression-free survival of 5 months compared with 2 to
3 months for the patients who had liposarcoma and leiomyosarcomas. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib at the dose and
schedule studied did not result in any responses in the VS, liposarcoma, or leiomyosarcoma cohort according to
C 2011 American Cancer Society.

KEYWORDS: tyrosine kinase inhibitor, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, angiosarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor.

Therapy for advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS) has been limited to few effective chemotherapeutic agents: anthracyclines, ifosfamide, gemcitabine with docetaxel, and dacarbazine. In Europe, trabectedin also is available. These agents have
proven activity in STS and have produced higher response rates for combination regimens, albeit at the expense of greater
toxicity without a clear survival advantage.
The development of targeted drugs has afforded an opportunity to evaluate new agents in advanced STS. Limited
preclinical data in sarcomas have made the selection of specific subtypes of sarcomas for therapeutic clinical trials challenging. Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006; Nexavar, Bayer Onyx) is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of raf, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 1 (VEGFR1), VEGFR2, VEGFR3, platelet-derived growth factor b (PDGFRB), fmslike tyrosine kinase 3 (flt-3), and the v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (c-kit), some of
which may be of relevance in STSs. It has been demonstrated that sarcomas express PDGFR1,2 as well as VEGFR,3
but the results are mixed regarding the correlation between VEGF and VEGFR expression as a predictor of clinical
outcome4-6; KIT expression is present in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) but not in most other sarcomas.7
We performed a multicenter, phase 2 trial in specific sarcoma histologies to test the clinical benefit of sorafenib. It
has been demonstrated that sarcomas derived from epithelial tissues, angiosarcomas, hemangiosarcomas, and solitary
fibrous tumors (previously termed hemangiopericytomas) all express VEGFR, VEGF messenger RNA,8-10 and
PDGFR.2,11,12 We hypothesized that sorafenib may inhibit autocrine or paracrine growth stimulation in these tumors.

Sorafenib in Advanced Sarcomas/von Mehren et al

We also included 2 of the most common, high-grade,
adult STSs, leiomyosarcoma and liposarcomas, because of
the known expression of VEGFR and PDGFR in these tumor histologies,1-3 as well as the potential correlation of
VEGF and VEGFR expression with prognosis.4-6 In addition, increasing preclinical data suggest that targeting
both VEGFR and PDGFR may be very effective in causing the regression of tumor-associated vasculature13,14;
thus, targeting these pathways may be of benefit for all 3
histologic groups. Here, we report the results from a multicenter, phase 2 study of BAY 43-9006 in patients with
advanced sarcomas (National Clinical Trials [NCT] registration identification number NCT0021762).

mas and administered through the SWOG. Patients
received sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily continuously
for 28 days. Toxicity was monitored and graded using version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events. Patients who experienced
grade 3 or 4 toxicities had their dose held until the toxicity
resolved to grade 2 or better. Therapy was continued with
a dose reduction, and 2 dose reductions were allowed
(200 mg twice daily and 200 mg daily). Patients who
required >2 weeks to recover from grade 4 toxicity or
who required more than 2 dose reductions were removed
from the study. After every two 28-day cycles, patients
were evaluated for tumor response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.15

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Patients were eligible for participation if they had measurable residual, recurrent, or metastatic vascular sarcomas
(cutaneous or visceral angiosarcoma, malignant hemangiosarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor), or grade 3/4 liposarcoma or leiomyosarcoma. Patients were eligible if they
were aged 18 years and had a Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were eligible if they underwent previous surgery, received previous radiation therapy, and
received 1 previous chemotherapy regimen for advanced
disease as long as they had recovered from all toxicities
and had not received chemotherapy within the past 4
weeks (6 weeks for carmustine and mitomycin C). Normal organ and bone marrow function were required.
Appropriate contraception while patients were receiving
therapy also was mandated. Patients who had a history of
brain metastases, thromboembolic disease, or uncontrolled infectious, cardiac, or psychiatric illness were
excluded as were patients who were receiving active anticoagulation. Women who were pregnant or breast feeding
and those who were receiving combination retroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency virus disease also were
not candidates for trial participation.
All participants provided oral and written informed
consent in accordance with institutional and federal
guidelines. The protocol was approved by the institutional
review boards at participating institutions and was monitored by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) study
coordinator, statistician, and Intergroup Coalition
Against Sarcomas chair (E.B.).
Study Design
This was a phase 2, open-label, multicenter study conducted through the Intergroup Coalition Against Sarco-

Cancer

February 1, 2012

Statistical Methods
Patients were stratified on the basis of histology: vascular
sarcoma (angiosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, or solitary fibrous tumor), versus leiomyosarcoma, versus liposarcoma
(dedifferentiated and myxoid/round cell). The primary
objective of the study was to assess the response probability (confirmed complete response [CR] and partial
response [PR]) in these 3 histologic strata. This design was
based on the assumption that, within each of the 3 strata,
a response probability of 25% would be of interest and
that further testing would not be pursued if the response
probability was 5%. Initially, 15 eligible patients were
to be accrued within each stratum. If 1 or more responses
were observed within a stratum, then an additional 10
patients were to be accrued to that stratum for a total of
25 eligible patients. If 4 responses were observed within
the 25 patients in the strata, then sorafenib would be considered worth of further study in that cohort. This design
allowed a significance level of 3% and a power of 90%
within each stratum.
In addition to within-stratum hypothesis testing,
this study was also designed to investigate the response
probability over all histologies. Once 40 eligible patients
over all strata had been accrued, the study temporarily
would close. If <2 responses were observed in the first 40
eligible patients, then the accrual for all strata would be
discontinued. Otherwise, a maximum of 35 additional
patients would be entered (depending on whether any
individual stratum was closed). Eight or more responses
out of the maximum 75 patients would be considered as
evidence warranting further study of the regimen provided other factors, such as toxicity and overall survival,
also appeared favorable. The properties of this design
were to vary based on the final sample size, the true

Original Article

response probability, and the observed frequency of
patients within each stratum. If 50% patients had leiomyosarcoma, 30% had liposarcoma, and 20% had vascular sarcoma, then the overall design had a significance
level of 4% (probability of falsely declaring the regimen
with a 5% response probability to warrant further study)
and power of 89% (probability of declaring the regimen
with a 15% response probability over all stratum to warrant further study). In addition, patients were followed to
assess the 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate
and the frequency and severity of adverse events on the
investigational therapy.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
This study was activated in March 2006 and closed in
February 2007 after completion of the first stage of
accrual. Fifty-one patients were registered on the study
from 20 institutions, and the goal was to register 40 eligible patients. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Thirteen patients were ineligible, including 3
patients each in the vascular sarcoma and liposarcoma
cohorts and 7 patients in the leiomyosarcoma cohort. Six
patients had elevated baseline laboratory values (primarily
anticoagulation parameters), 2 patients had received more
than 1 previous chemotherapy regimen beyond the adjuvant setting, and 1 patient had a grade 2 leiomyosarcoma
based on institutional pathology. Four additional patients
were ineligible after central pathology review with diagnoses of synovial sarcoma, myxofibrosarcoma, GIST, and
high-grade pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma. One
patient did not receive any study drug and was not
included in any of the subsequent analyses.
Toxicity
Thirty-seven patients were evaluable for adverse events.
There were no toxicities noted that had not been reported
previously with sorafenib. The most common adverse
events reported were fatigue in 59% (22 patients), handfoot syndrome in 57% (21 patients), and diarrhea in 49%
(18 patients), typically grades 1 and2. Three grade 4
events were reported, including 1 decline in hemoglobin,
1 elevated bilirubin level with aspartate transaminase elevation, 1 elevated lipase level, and 1 elevated amylase level.
Additional grade 3 adverse events included elevated lipase
levels (14%; n ¼ 5); hand-foot syndrome (11%; n ¼ 4);
electrolyte abnormalities (11%; n ¼ 4); diarrhea (11%; n
¼ 4); 2 episodes each of fatigue, hypertension, liver func-

reduction. One patient (3%) had drug held for thrombocytopenia, which did not resolve within 14 days, resulting
in removal from protocol therapy. Of the patients who
had no dose reductions, the median number of cycles was
3 (range, 1-10 cycles). In contrast, patients who received
dose reductions received a median of 4 cycles (range, 2-25
cycles). A greater percentage of patients who required
dose reductions had received previous chemotherapy and
radiation therapy compared with patients who did not
require dose reductions (33% vs 10%).
Response
No confirmed responses were observed in the 37 patients
who had response assessments (0%; 95% confidence
interval, 0%-9%) (Table 2). Because of lack of efficacy,
the study was terminated without proceeding to the second stage of accrual. One patient had an unconfirmed
PR. This was a woman aged 67 years who had a metastatic
uterine leiomyosarcoma diagnosed in 1996. Previous
therapies included pulmonary metastasectomy 2 years
and 5 years later, doxorubicin, and gemcitabine with
docetaxel. She was started on sorafenib and had an unconfirmed PR after 2 cycles. The patient progressed after 5
cycles of sorafenib.
A second patient who had a solitary metastatic fibrous tumor involving the liver and bone demonstrated
significant decreases in radiographic attenuation of the
metastatic lesions, as documented by a decline in Hounsfield units, despite stable target lesion measurements
according to RECIST (Fig. 1). These findings were suggestive of tumor necrosis, and the patient maintained stable disease for >2 years on sorafenib.
Fourteen patients (38%) had stable disease, including 5 patients with vascular sarcoma (63%), 8 patients
with leiomyosarcoma (42%), and 2 patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma (20%) (Table 3). Sixteen patients

Cancer

February 1, 2012

had progressive disease (43%). Response in 4 patients was
not assessable because of a lack of follow-up in 2 patients
and incomplete imaging at follow-up in the other 2
patients.
Thirty-six patients progressed: The median PFS was
3 months (95% confidence interval, 2-5 months), and
median overall survival was 17 months (95% confidence
interval, 13-25 months) (see Table 3, Fig. 2). PFS varied
by cohort, and the data are summarized in Table 3 and
Figure 3. The vascular sarcoma group had the longest PFS
(5 months; 95% CI, 3-6 months) followed by the leiomyosarcoma group (3 months; 95% CI, 2-9 months),
and the dedifferentiated and myxoid/round cell liposarcoma group had the shortest PFS (2 months; 95% CI,
1.6-2 months). Twenty-nine patients died, and the median overall survival was 17 months (95% confidence
interval, 13-25 months) (Table 3, Fig. 2). The vascular
sarcoma cohort had the longest overall survival (23
months; 95% CI, 7-38 months), followed by the leiomyosarcoma cohort (21 months; 95% CI, 13-27 months),
and the liposarcoma cohort had the shortest (15 months;
95% CI, 5-15 months). The 2 patients who remained on
study the longest were a patient who had high-grade leiomyosarcomas (18 cycles) and a patient who had a solitary
fibrous tumor (25 cycles).

DISCUSSION
In this study, sorafenib did not lead to any confirmed
responses. Our study, which enrolled 51 patients, was limited by a high rate of ineligible patients, particularly in the
2 cohorts in which some activity was noted, thus reducing
our statistical power to meet our endpoint. Although this
regimen did not have activity with regard to RECISTdefined response, there was the suggestion of a clinical
benefit, because 32% of patients remained on study

without progressive disease for 6 months. These results
compare favorably with the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) STS phase
2 data, in which a PFS rate of 14% was reported at 6
months for active agents in the second-line setting.16 In
addition, the PFS rate at 6 months in the leiomyosarcoma
group was 37% compared with 40% in previously
untreated patients who were receiving an anthracyclinebased regimen. The vascular sarcoma cohort had a PFS
rate of 38%; the EORTC data do not provide a reference
for angiosarcoma or other vascular tumors.
Sorafenib was tolerated without any unanticipated side
effects. The rate of dose reductions for toxicity was greater

774

than what was been reported previously for sorafenib in the
pivotal phase 3 renal cell carcinoma trial17; this may have
been because of stricter dose reduction guidelines or greater
predisposition to experiencing toxicity in this patient population. Indeed, the phase 2 experience in sarcoma had a similar
rate of dose reductions as the rate observed in our study.18
Maki and colleagues published the results from their
phase 2 trial of sorafenib in sarcomas.18 Similar to our experience, the most common toxicity was dermatologic;
however, fatigue or diarrhea were not reported. They also
noted 4 cases of hemorrhage, 1 case of a deep venous
thrombosis, 2 cases of perforation (1 in the ileum and the
other a pneumothorax), as well as 1 case each of congestive

heart failure, transient ischemic attack, and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy. All of these have been
described with antiangiogenic agents but were not
observed in our study with the exception of grade 1 epistaxis in 3 patients. In addition, those authors reported an
inverse correlation between toxicity and height, whereas
we did not observe this correlation in our patient population (data not shown).
In the study by Maki et al, 37 patients with vascular
tumors (primarily angiosarcoma with a few epithelioid
hemangioendotheliomas) were assessable for response.
Those authors reported 1 CR and 4 PRs in patients with
therapy naı̈ve, radiation-induced, high-grade angiosarcomas of the breast as well as previously treated high-grade
angiosarcomas of the head and neck. In addition, there
were 8 patients with vascular tumors who had stable disease for >6 months. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS
and overall survival for this group were 3.2 months and
14.3 months, respectively.
The other cohort that had a response noted by Maki
and colleagues was the leiomyosarcoma group, in which
there was 1 PR as well as 18 patients with stable disease
who had a PFS of 3.8 months and an overall survival of

Cancer

22.4 months. Prolonged stable disease for >6 months also
was observed in 2 patients with leiomyosarcoma as well as
1 each of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, conventional chondrosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma. Although they only had 3
patients on their trial with liposarcoma, 1 achieved stable
disease for <6 months, paralleling our experience.
Similar to our observations in solitary fibrous tumor,
activity of VEGF-directed therapies, including sorafenib,
sunitinib, and bevacizumab with temozolomide against this
subtype have recently been reported. Dumond and colleagues described benefit from sorafenib and sunitinib in solitary fibrous tumor.19 Other reports of benefit from sorafenib
include a CR in a patient with non-AIDS-related Kaposi’s
sarcoma,20 as well as a significant partial response in a patient
with metastatic synovial sarcoma involving the lung.21 Sunitinib has demonstrated clinical benefit in desmoplastic small
round cell tumor, solitary fibrous tumor, alveolar soft part
sarcoma, giant cell tumor of bone, synovial sarcoma, and
chordoma.22 A phase 2 trial of sunitinib in solitary fibrous
tumors demonstrated prolonged stable disease with changes
in tumor density.23 A phase 2 study of bevacizumab also
demonstrated responses and stable disease in vascular sarcomas24; however, the combination of bevacizumab with doxorubicin was associated with a higher risk of cardiac toxicity
than is usually observed with doxorubicin alone.25 A recent
report of pazopanib demonstrated a PFS rate at 12 weeks of
26% in adipocytic tumors, 44% in leiomyosarcomas, and
39% in a cohort of STSs that included vascular tumors.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that sorafenib
had some activity in patients with vascular sarcomas and
perhaps in patients with leiomyosarcomas based on favorable PFS. Our study results support other reported clinical
trial data findings with sorafenib and other multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors in sarcomas. The limited activity in

775

Original Article

dedifferentiated and myxoid/round cell liposarcomas in our
study, as well as in others, suggests that this histology is less
sensitive to antiangiogenic therapies. The limited number of
objective responses reported in this and other studies suggests that studies combining sorafenib with chemotherapy
may lead to enhanced activity; it also may reflect the difficulties of using RECIST criteria for determining response with
targeted therapies. There are ongoing studies evaluating sorafenib and other tyrosine kinase-directed therapies combined with chemotherapy in STS that may result in greater
tumor shrinkage.
