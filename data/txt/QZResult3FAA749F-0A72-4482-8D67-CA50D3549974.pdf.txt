Abstract
Men who develop metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) invariably succumb to
the disease. The development and progression to CRPC following androgen ablation therapy is
predominantly driven by unregulated androgen receptor (AR) signaling1-3. Despite the success of
recently approved therapies targeting AR signaling such as abiraterone4-6 and second generation
anti-androgens MDV3100 (enzalutamide)7,8, durable responses are limited, presumably due to
acquired resistance. Recently JQ1 and I-BET, two selective small molecule inhibitors that target

the amino-terminal bromodomains of BRD4, have been shown to exhibit anti-proliferative effects
in a range of malignancies9-12. Here we show that AR signaling-competent CRPC cell lines are
preferentially sensitive to BET bromodomain inhibition. BRD4 physically interacts with the Nterminal domain of AR and can be disrupted by JQ111,13. Like the direct AR antagonist,
MDV3100, JQ1 disrupted AR recruitment to target gene loci. In contrast to MDV3100, JQ1
functions downstream of AR, and more potently abrogated BRD4 localization to AR target loci
and AR-mediated gene transcription including induction of TMPRSS2-ERG and its oncogenic
activity. In vivo, BET bromodomain inhibition was more efficacious than direct AR antagonism in
CRPC xenograft models. Taken together, these studies provide a novel epigenetic approach for the
concerted blockade of oncogenic drivers in advanced prostate cancer.

The identification and therapeutic targeting of co-activators or mediators of AR
transcriptional signaling should be considered as alternate strategies to treat CRPC14. BRD4
is a conserved member of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of chromatin
readers that include BRD2/3 and BRDT. BRD4 plays a critical role in transcription by RNA
PolII by facilitating recruitment of the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb15,16.
Similar to other BET-family proteins, BRD4 contains two conserved bromodomains, BD1
and BD2. Competitive binding of JQ1 or I-BET to the bromodomain pocket results in the
displacement of BRD4 from active chromatin and subsequent removal of RNA PolII from
target genes10-13,17. Although most cancer cells express BET-family proteins it is not clear
why only a subset of cell lines from diverse cancers respond to BET-inhibitors9,18. Recently,
BRD4 was shown to interact with sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors in a
gene-specific manner 19. As the genetic and epigenetic landscape differs between tumor
types, it is possible that distinct transcriptional regulators that associate with BRD4 might
influence the action of BET-inhibitors.

In order to discover new treatment options for CRPc, we treated a panel of 5 prostate cancer
and 1 benign prostate cell line with JQ1 and found three of the AR-signaling positive cells to
be sensitive to JQ1 though all six cell lines express high levels of its target proteins (Fig. 1a
and Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). Next, knock-down of BRD2/3/4 (Extended Data Fig. 1c)
showed significant inhibition of cell proliferation/invasion, phenocopying JQ1-treatment
(Extended Data Fig. 1d, e). Further, JQ1 treatment induced G0-G1 arrest, apoptosis and
associated transcriptional downregulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL-xl in AR-positive cells
(Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1f-1h)13,18. Similar to BCL2 down-regulation by the BETinhibitor I-BET151 in leukemia10, reduction in BCL-xl by JQ1 could be explained in part by
the observed loss of BRD2/3/4 recruitment to its promoter region (Extended Data Fig. 1j).
Even at 100nM, long term colony-formation of AR-positive cells were severely inhibited by
JQ1 (Extended Data Fig. 1k) with no apparent effect on JQ1 target proteins (Extended Data
Fig. 1l, m). As AR-positive cells were preferentially sensitive to JQ1, we examined whether
JQ1 has an effect on AR target genes. VCaP cells that harbor TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion
and AR amplification20 displayed a dose-dependent decrease in PSA and ERG at the mRNA
and protein levels upon JQ1 treatment (Fig. 1d, e). Similar effects were observed in LNCaP
and 22RV1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b). Furthermore, bortezomib did not reverse the
JQ1-mediated PSA and ERG protein loss, indicating that these genes are regulated at the
transcriptional level (Extended Data Fig. 2c). We performed microarray analysis to examine

changes in global gene expression upon JQ1 treatment. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) using the AR-gene signature revealed significant repression of these genes in ARpositive cells (Fig. 1f) suggesting the role of BET-proteins in AR-mediated transcription.
Additionally, we observed a loss of the MYC-associated gene signature in AR-positive cell
lines upon JQ1-treatment (Extended Data Fig. 2d). MYC is a known transcriptional target of
BET-inhibition in hematological cancers11,18. Interestingly, MYC levels were attenuated by
JQ1 in cells that are AR-positive and sensitive to JQ1 inhibition, but not in AR-negative
cells (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Thus, high expression of MYC per se (Extended Data Fig. 1b)
does not confer sensitivity to JQ1 in prostate cancer cells. Time-course experiments with
JQ1 demonstrated loss of MYC (Extended Data Fig. 2f, g) and cyclohexamide had no
additional effect on MYC protein levels (Extended Data Fig. 2h, i), ruling out a posttranslational mode of JQ1 action. Phenotypically, knockdown of MYC did not affect cell
invasion (Extended Data Fig. 2j), while JQ1-treatment inhibited invasion (Extended Data
Fig. 1e). Additionally, exogenous expression of MYC did not result in a rescue of JQ1mediated inhibition of cell growth (Extended Data Fig. 2k, l). Thus, while MYC levels may
be repressed by JQ1 in AR-positive cell, and may have a role in proliferation, MYC does not
appear to be the primary target for the anti-neoplastic effects of JQ1.

Since BRD4 is known to engage sequence-specific DNA binding proteins19, we
hypothesized that AR may interact directly with BRD4. We performed gel-filtrationchromatography and found that AR and BRD4 predominantly co-eluted in a high-molecular
weight complex (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Moreover, RNA PolII, a reported
target for phosphorylation by BRD421, also co-eluted in the same complex, suggestive of a
large multi-protein complex composed of AR, BRD4 and RNA PolII. Immunoprecipitation
experiments further confirmed an endogenous association between AR and BRD4 (Fig. 2b).
Additionally, we observed an interaction between AR and BRD2/3 (Fig. 2b), implicating a
common region in BRD2/3/4 proteins responsible for AR interaction. To map the region
mediating this interaction, we tested the ability of different deletion variants of BRD4 to
pull-down AR in 293T cells (Fig. 2c). BRD4 variant containing BD1-BD2 domains
maintained the ability to pull-down AR even at high salt concentrations (Fig. 2d, e). To
determine whether the BD1-BD2 domains directly interact with AR, we carried out
quantitative assessment of the binding affinity using the Octet-RED system. We applied
varying concentrations of BD1-BD2 protein to biosensors with immobilized AR and found
that BRD4 interacts with AR in a concentration-dependent fashion, with an estimated Kd of
70nM, supporting a high affinity interaction (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 3b, c). To finemap this interaction we created a series of Halo-AR and GST-BRD4 constructs for in vitro
pull-down studies and demonstrated that the BD1, and to a lesser extent the BD2, bind
directly to NTD-domain of AR, which was further mapped to a 38 amino acid region
NTD1b of AR (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 3d-f). Subsequently, we observed the
disruption of BD1-AR and BD1-NTD1b interactions by JQ1 (Fig. 2h) as well as loss of
endogenous BRD4-AR interaction (Extended Data Fig. 3g). Together, these data suggest
that BET protein inhibition leads to disruption of the AR-BRD4 interaction and likely
explains the preferential activity of JQ1 in AR-positive prostate cancer cells.

Ubiquitously expressed BRD2/3/4 proteins are suggested to have overlapping
functions10,13,22 and consistent with this notion, we observed AR interaction with
BRD2/3/4. Since BET-inhibitors such as JQ1 and I-BET762 have high affinity for
BD1/BD2 domain of BRD2/3/4 proteins10,11,13, we hypothesized that BET-inhibitors may
affect genome-wide recruitment of all the three BET-proteins. We performed ChIP-seq with
antibodies against BRD2/3/4 in VCaP cells treated with JQ1 or I-BET762 (Extended Data
Fig. 4a) and observed a high genome-wide overlap between BRD2/3/4 (62-86% peak
overlap) (Extended Data Fig. 4b, c). JQ1 or I-BET762 treatment led to a reduction in the
recruitment of all three proteins to chromatin (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Moreover, the
reduced BRD2/3/4 recruitment was equally distributed for regions with or without AR
(Extended Data Fig. 4e).

Binding of androgen (DHT) to AR leads to its translocation from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus where it binds to regions of DNA harboring AREs and results in subsequent
recruitment of proteins involved in transcriptional activation or suppression in a genespecific manner. BRD4 interacts with acetylated histones as well as DNA-binding
transcription factors, leading to context-dependent transcriptional activation or inhibition of
target genes15,19,22. Since the AR-BRD4 interaction is disrupted by JQ1 (Fig. 2), we next
explored whether AR localization is affected in a genome-wide context. We performed
ChIP-seq with antibodies against AR, BRD4, and RNA PolII in cells that were either
starved, treated with DHT or DHT+JQ1 (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Two anti-androgens,
bicalutamide and MDV3100 were included for comparison. As expected, the average ChIPseq signal for AR was highly enriched in DHT-treated cells (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig.
5a, b). Recruitment of AR to target loci was markedly attenuated by MDV3100 and less so
by bicalutamide. Interestingly, JQ1 blocked AR recruitment almost as effectively as
MDV3100 (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5c-e). Furthermore, we observed a corecruitment of AR and BRD4 at 2,031 sites. The strongest association was observed within
promoters of AR-regulated genes (502 promoters, p=4e-49), and for the highest AR peaks
(1,112 sites, p=1e-38) (Fig. 3b). Limiting our evaluation to AR and BRD4 coincident peaks,
we observed that DHT-mediated AR recruitment to these loci was inhibited by MDV3100
and to a lesser extent by JQ1 (Fig. 3c). In contrast, JQ1 almost completely abrogated DHTinduced BRD4 recruitment to the AR-BRD4 shared loci (Fig. 3d). Examples of gene tracks
for AR- and BRD4-associated genomic regions such as enhancers and super-enhancers17
and the effects of different treatments on their levels are shown in Fig. 3e, and Extended
Data Fig. 5f. In corroboration with the ChIP-seq data, gene expression analysis in VCaP and
LNCaP cells displayed more efficient repression of DHT-induced AR-target genes by JQ1
than by MDV3100 or bicalutamide (Extended Data Fig. 5g, h).

JQ1-treatment had a marked effect on ERG expression in VCaP cells (Fig. 1d, e and
Extended Data Fig. 5h) and we found that the attenuation of DHT-induced ERG expression
by JQ1 was due to de-recruitment of RNA PolII from ERG gene body and reduced binding
of AR and BRD4 on the TMPRSS2 promoter/enhancer (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). The
efficient ERG downregulation by JQ1 has significant implication as TMPRSS2-ERG gene
fusion product is the oncogenic driver in 50% of prostate cancers20,23. To investigate the
effect of JQ1 on ERG-mediated transcription we performed ERG ChIP-seq in cells treated

with JQ1 for 12hrs; a time window where ERG protein levels are still unaffected by JQ1
(Extended Data Fig. 6c), and observed a significant loss in the top 4% of ERG enriched
peaks (Extended Data Fig. 6d). We next determined the functional consequence of JQ1
treatment by measuring the expression levels of select ERG target genes (Extended Data
Fig. 6e, f). As expected, the ERG-activated genes were down-regulated and ERG-repressed
genes were de-repressed by JQ1 (Extended Data Fig. 6g, h). To evaluate BET inhibitor
repression of ERG-mediated oncogenic function in an isogenic setting, we overexpressed
ERG in RWPE and PC3 cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a, b). Treatment of JQ1 or I-BET762 led
to an attenuation of ERG-mediated invasion (Extended Data Fig. 7c) and GSEA
demonstrated a significant negative enrichment for ERG target genes upon BET inhibitor
treatment (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Further, we found that ERG was highly enriched on the
known distal-enhancer of MYC that was reduced upon JQ1-treatment (Extended Data Fig.
8a, b). Likewise, ETV1 occupies the same distal-enhancer region in ETV1 fusion-positive
LNCaP23. Knockdown of ERG or ETV1 along with AR led to MYC down-regulation,
implicating MYC regulation by ETS proteins in fusion-positive prostate cancer cells
(Extended Data Fig. 8c-e). Notably, ChIP-seq analysis of AR and RNA PolII enrichment at
the MYC locus presented an interesting pattern where DHT treatment led to increased AR
and reduced RNA PolII binding on the MYC distal-enhancer and gene body respectively,
that was reinstated in the presence of MDV3100 or bicalutamide but not JQ1 (Extended
Data Fig. 8f). This observation is consistent with the concomitant reduction in MYC
expression upon DHT treatment that was de-repressed in the presence of MDV3100 but not
JQ1 (Extended Data Fig. 8g-i). Lack of de-repression of MYC by JQ1 in this setting could
be explained by the fact that both AR and ERG are absent from the MYC distal-enhancer
leading to net loss of MYC expression. This data also suggests a mechanism by which
CRPC patients become resistant to anti-androgen therapy by maintaining expression of the
MYC oncogene.

Next, we sought to compare the efficacy of JQ1 and MDV3100, a direct AR antagonist used
clinically to treat advanced CRPC8. Before embarking on the in vivo experiment we tested
them on VCaP cells in vitro for 8 days and observed marginal cell death by MDV3100
versus suppression of cell growth at sub-micromolar concentrations by JQ1 (Extended Data
Fig. 9a). To rule out the possibility of JQ1 being a generic anti-androgen, we confirmed that
JQ1 had no effect on physiologic androgen-regulated processes; however, JQ1 reduced
testes size in mice as reported earlier24 (Extended Data Fig. 9b-f). Treatment of VCaP
tumor-bearing mice with JQ1 led to significant reduction in tumor volume/weight (Fig. 4a,
band Extended Data Fig. 10a); however, MDV3100 had a less pronounced effect. Recently,
several studies described the pro-metastatic effects of MDV3100 in pre-clinical models25.
To test whether MDV3100 treatment leads to spontaneous metastasis in our VCaP xenograft
model, we isolated femur, liver and spleen from MDV3100-treated mice and found evidence
of metastases in femur and liver (Extended Data Fig. 10b, c). By contrast, JQ1-treated mice
displayed no evidence of metastasis (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Taken together, these preclinical studies suggest that the use of MDV3100 in clinically localized prostate cancer may
potentiate the formation of micro-metastases unlike BET-inhibitors. Consistent with
previous reports, JQ1 and MDV3100 were both well tolerated by mice (Extended Data Fig.
10d). Although VCaP cells were originally derived from a patient with CRPc, VCaP tumor

xenografts respond to castration in mouse models. We found that JQ1 still had a growth
inhibitory effect in castration-resistant VCaP tumor xenografts and observed a 50%
reduction in castration-resistant tumors by JQ1-treatment (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig.
10e).

Maintenance of AR signaling is the most common resistance mechanism that patients with
advanced prostate cancer develop after conventional hormonal treatments26. AR
amplification, mutation, and alternative splicing have all been suggested as potential
resistance mechanisms to anti-androgen treatments2,27,28. Over half of CRPC patients have
at least one of these aberrations in the AR pathway29. As BET-inhibitors function
“downstream” of AR (Fig. 4d), our data suggests that these compounds may be effective in
the context of AR-mediated resistance including compensatory mechanisms involving
related steroid hormone receptors that are also likely to require BET bromodomain function.
By functioning downstream of AR, BET-inhibition is less likely to be affected by acquired
resistance associated with AR antagonists, including the recently identified F876L mutation
of AR30. While both MDV3100 and JQ1 block AR recruitment to target loci on a genomewide scale (the “AR cistrome”), we found that JQ1 likely has an enhanced inhibitory effect
by further abrogating co-recruitment of BRD4, which is required for mobilization of the
transcriptional machinery15,16. A recent study demonstrated that BET-inhibition leads to
preferential loss of BRD4 at “super-enhancers” and consequent transcriptional elongation
defects17. These super-enhancers were often associated with key oncogenic drivers in a
variety of cancers. Tumor cells are thought to become addicted to select oncogenes and
hence unusually reliant on their high expression, which may explain the preferential
sensitivity of BET-inhibition in cancer versus normal tissues. While MYC and its
association with multiple myeloma was highlighted as a super-enhancer dependent cancer17,
this framework likely applies to key transcription factors involved in the development of
CRPC including AR, ETS, and MYC (Fig. 4d). Taken together, these data strongly suggest
that clinical evaluation of BET-inhibitors is warranted in CRPc, either as monotherapy or in
combination with second generation anti-androgens.

Immunoprecipitations
For endogenous immunoprecipitation experiments, nuclear extracts were obtained from
VCaP and LNCaP cells using NE-PER nuclear extraction kit (Thermo Scientific). Nuclear
pellet was then lysed in IP buffer (20mM Tris pH7.5, 150mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X 100,
Protease Inhibitor) by sonication. Nuclear lysates (0.5-1.0mg) were pre-cleaned by
incubation with protein G Dynabeads (Life Technologies) for 1 hr. on a rotator at 4°C. 5μg
antibody was added to the pre-cleared lysates and incubated on a rotator at 4°C overnight
prior to the addition of protein G Dynabeads for 1hr. Beads were washed thrice in IP buffer

and resuspended in 40 μL of 2x loading buffer and boiled at 90°C for 10 minutes for
separation of the protein and beads. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western
blotting as described above. For endogenous competitive assays, the VCaP cells were
incubated with 5 or 25μM JQ1 for 6 hrs. prior to nuclear protein extractions.
For co-immunonoprecipitation experiments in 293T cells, plasmids encoding various
deletion mutants of BRD4 in pCDNA4c, (Addgene) and full length AR in pFN21 plasmid
(Promega) were transfected using Fugene 6.0 HD (Roche) according to the manufacturer's
instruction. Twenty four hrs. post transfection, total proteins were extracted using IP buffer
supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail mix (Sigma) and the expressions of the
corresponding proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation using Halobeads followed by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody were performed as described
above.

Cell free protein-protein interaction studies
In vitro protein expression was carried out by cloning the desired expression cassettes
downstream of a Halo- or GST-tag to produce fusion proteins. Briefly, AR and its subdomains were cloned into the pFN2K vector containing N-terminal GST sequence (Cat.#
G1891, Promega); BRD4 and its sub-domains were cloned into the pFN19A vector
containing N-terminal Halo sequence (Cat.# C8461, Promega). After cloning, the fusion
proteins were expressed using the cell-free transcription and translation system (Cat.#
L5030, Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. For each reaction, protein
expression was confirmed by Western blot.

Author Manuscript

A total of 10μl cell-free reaction containing halo- and GST-tag fusion proteins were
incubated in PBST (0.1% tween) at 4°C overnight. Ten microliter HaloLink beads
(Cat.#G931, Promega) were blocked in BSA at 4°C for overnight. After washes with PBS,
the beads were mixed with AR-BRD4 mixture and incubated at RT for 1hr. Halolink beads
were then washed with PBST for 4 times and eluted in SDS loading buffer. Proteins were
separated on SDS gel and blotted with anti-GST Ab (GE healthcare). For competitive assay,
AR-BD1, NTD1b-BD1 and AR-BD2 mixture was incubated in the presence of varying
doses of JQ1 compound.
AR:BRD4 Direct Interaction Assays by OctetRED

Author Manuscript

The binding affinity between AR and BRD4 was determined by biolayer interferometry
technology using the OctetRED system (ForteBio). Recombinant AR protein (Cat.#
AR-8486H, Creative Biomart) was biotinylated by EZ-Link NHS-PEG4 Biotinylation Kit
(Cat.# 21329, Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's protocol and any
unincorporated biotin was removed from the reactions with Zeba 2ml desalt columns.
Biotinylated proteins (5μg/ml) were then incubated with super-streptavidin biosensors
(Cat.#18-5057, ForteBio) in binding buffer (20mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl) and
washed three times in binding buffer. BRD4 (BD1- BD2) protein (Cat.# 31047, BPS
Biosciences) was serially diluted in binding buffer, and the AR:BRD4 association/
dissociation was monitored by OctetRED for 10 min at 25°C. Non-specific binding was
controlled by subtracting the signal obtained from AR:RNF2 interactions from that of

AR:BRD4 interactions and baseline signal drift was controlled by monitoring immobilized
AR without BRD4. OctetRED analysis software was used to analyze the data.
Gene Expression Array Analysis

Author Manuscript

VCaP, LNCaP, 22RV1 and DU145 cells were treated with 500nM JQ1 for 24 hrs. and total
RNA extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) for gene expression array analysis. For
anti-androgen comparative study, VCaP and LNCaP cells were grown in media containing
10% charcoal-striped serum for 48 hrs. followed by pre-treatment with 500nM JQ1, 10μM
MDV3100 or 25μM Bicalutamide for 6 hrs. and stimulated with 10nM DHT (androgen) for
18 hrs. Cells treated with only vehicle or 10nM DHT served as controls. For determining the
effect of BET inhibitors in isogenic ERG system, RWPE-ERG and PC3-ERG cells were
treated with 500nM JQ1 or I-BET762 for 24hrs. Expression profiling was performed using
the Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray (SantaClara, CA) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. All samples were run in technical duplicates or quadruplets against
control. Over- and under-expressed gene sets were generated by filtering to include only
data points that displayed 2-fold average over- or underexpression (Log ratio with p<0.001)
in all hybridizations.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using the JAVA program (http://
www.broadinstitute.org/gsea) as described31.

The ERG gene signature was generated by extracting 2-fold upregulated genes from RWPE
and PC3 cells stably expressing ERG compared to respective LacZ expressing cells. GSEA
was performed using this gene set on gene expression data obtained from the JQ1 and IBET762 treated RWPE and PC3 cells. We also ran GSEA using gene set that was not
changed upon expression of ERG to exclude the possibility that treatment with JQ1 and IBET762 may change gene expression in a non-specific fashion. All of the gene expression
array data (total 48) can be found at GEO # GSE55064.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-seq

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The ChIP assays for BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, AR, RNA PolII, ERG and H3K27ac were
performed using HighCell ChIP kit (Diagenode) according to manufacturer's protocol. The
antibodies used for ChIP assay are AR_PG-21 (Millipore Cat. # 06-680) ; RNA Pol II
(Abcam Cat. # ab5408); BRD2 (Bethyl Cat. # A302-583A) ; BRD3 (Bethyl Cat. #
A302-368A) ; BRD4 (Bethyl Cat. # A301-985A); H3 (acetyl K27) (Abcam Cat. # ab4729)
and IgG (Diagenode). For BRD2/3/4 ChIP-seq experiments with BET inhibitors, VCaP cells
were treated with 500 nM JQ1 or I-BET762 for 12hrs. For AR signaling ChIP-seq
experiments, VCaP cells were grown in charcoal-stripped serum containing media for 48hrs.
followed by 6hrs. pre-treatment with vehicle or 500nM JQ1 or 10μM MDV3100 or 25μM
Bicalutamide and then stimulated with 10nM DHT for 12hrs. For ERG ChIP-seq studies,
VCaP cells were treated with 500nM JQ1 or vehicle for 12hrs. Next, cells were cross-linked
for 10 min. with 1% formaldehyde. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of 1/10
volume 1.25M glycine for 5 min. at room temperature followed by cell lysis and sonication
(Bioruptor, Diagenode), resulting in an average chromatin fragment size of 200bp.
Chromatin equivalent to 5×106 cells were used for ChIP using various antibodies. ChIP
DNA was isolated (IPure Kit, Diagenode) from samples by incubation with the antibody at
4°C overnight followed by wash and reversal of cross-linking. The ChIP-seq sample
preparation for sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Illumina). ChIP-enriched DNA samples (1-10 ng) were converted to blunt-ended fragments
using T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA polymerase I large fragment (Klenow polymerase)
and T4 polynuleotide kinase (New England BioLabs, NEB). A single A-base was added to
fragment ends by Klenow fragment (3′ to 5′ exo minus; NEB) followed by ligation of
Illumina adaptors (Quick ligase, NEB). The adaptor-modified DNA fragments were
enriched by PCR using the Illumina Barcode primers and Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB).
PCR products were size selected using 3% NuSieve agarose gels (Lonza) followed by gel
extraction using QIAEX II reagents (QIAGEN). Libraries were quantified with the
Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer (100
nucleotide read length).

ChIP-seq Analysis

Author Manuscript

ChIP-seq enrichment levels—ChIP enrichment levels within a peak (or site) were
calculated from the sequencing data as follows: (1) reads were aligned to the HG19
reference genome using Bowtie232 with all default settings. (2) Aligned reads were sorted
using NovoSort and exact duplicates were removed using Samtools33. (3) For each peak
(site) overlapping reads were counted and this count was divided by the length of the peak
or site. (4) To correct for differences in sequencing depth and alignment coverage the values
are further normalized by the number of aligned reads per million.

Author Manuscript

ChIP-seq reproducibility plots—To assess the biological variability of AR and ERG
ChIP-seq experiments we have compared enrichment levels of their respective replicates.
For each replicate we called peaks using MACS with all default setting against an IgG
control. We excluded peaks within genomic regions prone to technical-artifacts34. For each
replicate pair we defined a set of concordant peaks as those overlapping in both replicates.
For each concordant peak we calculated enrichment levels within the union of the two
overlapping peaks. The scatter plots include all peaks with enrichment levels up-to the 99th
percentile.

Author Manuscript

Overlaps of bromodomain proteins—We compared the genome-wide distribution of
BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 peaks in DMSO treated VcaP cells. First, we called peaks for each
of the proteins using MACS with all default settings and IgG control. Since we are
interested in peaks that are possibly biologically significant we used a moderately stringent
significance cut-off (MACS score > 100). Next, we identified all genomic regions that were
enriched for at least one of the proteins. Specifically, we “reduced” all stringent peaks using
GenomicRanges35. For each of those regions we established which of the bromodomain
proteins were enriched to count the number of overlaps.
Drug-induced changes of bromodomain protein enrichment levels—For each
protein (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4) we assessed quantitative changes in their respective
enrichment levels upon drug treatment (I-BET762, JQ1) relative to the levels in the DMSO
control. First, peaks were called for all conditions and proteins as described above. Next, for
each protein separately, we identified genomic that were enriched in any (union) of the
treatment conditions (DMSO, I-BET762, or JQ1). Within those regions we quantified
enrichment levels as described in (ChIP-seq enrichment levels). Since enrichment levels of
different proteins are not directly comparable, we normalize all enrichments to the median
level of the DMSO control.

Author Manuscript

Differential AR-BRD4 enrichment and AR-BRD4 overlap—HPeak, a Hidden
Markov model (HMM)-based peak-calling software36 designed for the identification of
protein-interactive genomic regions, was employed for ChIP-seq peak determination. For
enrichment plots shown in Fig. 3a,c and d, identified peaks for each sample are centered by
peak summit and average coverage per million was counted within 1500bp relative to the
peak center. The overlap of AR- and BRD4- enriched regions were calculated by
BEDtools37. The significance of overlap between AR and BRD4 binding was calculated
using hypergeometric test based on the derived number of associated genes. The heatmap

for AR peak enrichment was generated using python-based script on raw data and visualized
using JavaTreeView38.

Author Manuscript

Differential ERG enrichment—We identified sites with significant differences in ERG
levels between DMSO- and JQ1-treated cells. First we focused on concordant peaks (see
ChIP-seq reproducibility plots) that were overlapping or in the +/- 5 kbp proximity of
annotated gene loci. We defined a gene locus as the union of all of its known transcripts
(Ensembl Genes 73). We used DESeq2 to assess the statistical significance of differences in
ERG enrichment levels. Although DESeq2 was originally developed for RNA-seq its
statistical model is well-suited to count data in general. We used the tools' default multiple
hypothesis correction method and report peaks with significant differences in ERG levels
(adjusted P-value < 0.1). To assess quantitative differences in ERG levels at significantly
“gained” (positive difference in ERG levels upon JQ1 treatment) and “lost” (negative
difference in ERG levels upon JQ1 treatment) we followed the same procedure as in (ChIPseq enrichment levels).
Murine Prostate Tumor Xenograft Model

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Four week-old male SCID C.B17 mice were procured from a breeding colony at University
of Michigan maintained by our group. Mice were anesthetized using 2% Isoflurane
(inhalation) and 2×106 VCaP prostate cancer cells suspended in 100μl of PBS with 50%
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were implanted subcutaneously into the dorsal flank on both
sides of the mice. Once the tumors reached a palpable stage (100mm3), the animals were
randomized and treated with either 10mg/kg body weight MDV3100 or 50mg/kg body
weight (doses previously used in mouse prostate cancer and multiple myeloma models11,39)
by oral gavage or intraperitonially respectively for five days a week. Growth in tumor
volume was recorded using digital calipers and tumor volumes were estimated using the
formula (π/6) (L × W2), where L = length of tumor and W = width. Loss of body weight
during the course of the study was also monitored. At the end of the studies mice were
sacrificed and tumors extracted and weighed. Additionally, femur bone marrow, liver and
spleen were harvested to determine spontaneous metastasis by measuring human-Alu
sequence. Briefly, genomic DNA from femur bone marrow, liver and spleen were prepared
using Puregene DNA purification system (Qiagen), followed by quantification of human
ALU sequence by human Alu specific Fluorogenic TaqMan qPCR probes as described40,41.
For CRPC experiment, VCaP tumor bearing mice were castrated when the tumors were
approximately 200mm3 in size and once the tumor grew back to the pre-castration size were
randomized and treated with JQ1 or vehicle (D5W) control. All procedures involving mice
were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA) at the
University of Michigan and conform to all regulatory standards.
Prostate Histology and hormone measurement
Four to five weeks old male SCID C.B17 mice were administered vehicle, 10mg/kg
MDV3100 or 50mg/kg JQ1, by oral gavage or intraperitonially, respectively for five days a
week. Highly hormone responsive seminal vesicles attached to prostate were harvested from
mice after four weeks of injection. Prostate were fixed in formalin solution and processed
for sectioning. Standard H&E staining was performed on the formalin fixed sections and

blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture from mice anesthetized with isoflurane.
The serum was separated from the blood and stored at −80°C until assayed. Serum

Extended Data Figure 8. JQ1 inhibits ETS (ERG/ETV1) factors that regulate MYC expression
in VCaP and LNCaP cells

a, Genome browser representation of ERG and ETV1 binding events on the MYC distal
enhancer42. JQ1-treatment in VCaP cells reduces ERG enrichment as shown in two
independent ERG ChIP-seq experiments. The y-axis denotes reads per million per base pair
(rpm/bp), the x-axis denotes the genomic position. LNCaP ETV1 ChIP-seq data is from
Chen et. al. 2013, displaying ETV1 recruitment to the MYC distal enhancer. b, ChIP-PCR
validation of loss of ERG recruitment after JQ1-treatment in VCaP cells. Data show mean ±

ETS factor reduces MYC gene expression in VCaP and LNCaP cells. QRT-PCR for AR,
ETS and MYC expression in siNT, siAR or siETS transfected cells. Data show mean ± S.D.
(n =3) from one of the two independent experiments. e, A cartoon illustrating the
mechanism of MYC loss by JQ1 in AR positive VCaP and LNCaP cells. f, Anti-androgens
but not JQ1 de-repress MYC expression in prostate cancer cells. Genome browser
representation of AR and RNA PolII binding events within the MYC gene locus. The y-axis
denotes reads per million per base pair (rpm/bp), the x-axis denotes the genomic position.
Note the AR recruitment to the same distal enhancer which is occupied by ERG (see
Extended Data Fig. 8a), implicating a competition between AR and ETS factor to bind to
this enhancer region to regulate MYC gene expression. g, Heat map showing the MYC
expression values from VCaP microarray gene expression data. h, Anti-androgen restores
DHT-repressed MYC expression in VCaP cells. QRT-PCR of MYC in VCaP cells treated
with vehicle, DHT (10nM), DHT+JQ1 (500nM), DHT+MDV3100 (10μM) or DHT
+Bicalutamide (25μM). Inability of JQ1 to de-repress MYC in this setting could be
explained by the fact that both AR and ERG is de-recruited from MYC distal enhancer
leading to net loss of MYC expression. i, MDV3100 and not JQ1 restores DHT-repressed
MYC protein levels in VCaP cells. Immunoblot of MYC protein in VCaP cells pre-treated
with vehicle, MDV3100 (10μM) or JQ1 (500nM) for 4hrs followed by DHT (10nM) for
20hrs. Data show mean ± S.D.(n =3) from one of the two independent experiments. NS, not
significant; *P ≤ 0.01; **P ≤ 0.001; **P ≤ 0.0001 by two-tailed Student's t-test.

the femur (bone marrow) and soft tissues such as liver and spleen. Genomic DNA isolated
from these sites was analyzed for metastasized cells by measuring human ALU sequence (by
Alu-QPCR). MDV3100-treated mice displayed spontaneous metastasis to femur and liver.
Spleen did not show presence of human ALU sequences. c as in a, for mice bearing VCaP
xenografts treated with vehicle (n = 6), JQ1 (n = 6) or MDV3100 (n = 6). MDV3100-treated
but not JQ1-treated mice displayed metastasis to femur and liver. d, JQ1 or MDV3100
treatment does not affect animal weight. Mice from VCaP cell xenograft experiments treated
with vehicle, 10mg/kg MDV3100 or 50mg/kg JQ1 were weighed at the time of caliper
measurements. e, Individual tumor volume for vehicle or JQ1-treated VCaP mouse
