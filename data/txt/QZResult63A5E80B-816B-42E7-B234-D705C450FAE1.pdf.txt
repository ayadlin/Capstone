BACKGROUND: Mycosis fungoides (MF) and leukemic Sézary syndrome (SS) are the most common cutaneous T cell lymphomas
(CTCL), but their etiology remains unknown. After patients were observed with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)-associated CTCL, HCTZ
was examined as a putative chronic antigen in a cohort of prospectively staged patients. METHODS: Demographic and drug exposure
data was examined from 1443 confirmed MF and SS patients. Hypertensive CTCL patients were divided into HCTZ users or nonusers
for statistical analysis by chi-square and t tests. Causality in a case series was rated by the Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability
Scale. RESULTS: A total of 815 of 1443 MF and SS patients (56.5%) were hypertensive; 205 (25.2%) were taking HCTZ at initial staging. Comparing stage of patients who were using or not using HCTZ, the most significant difference was between stage I and stage
IV (odds ratio of 0.45; 95% confidence interval of 0.25-0.78, P ¼ .003), demonstrating reduced likelihood of being stage IV in patients
who were on HCTZ. Seventy-seven percent of the MF patients on HCTZ were stage I. A total of 125 patients of 196 (63.8%) started
HCTZ prior to developing CTCL lesions, and 35 of 121 (28.0%) started within 1 year of first skin rash. Thirty-six of 125 patients (28.8%)
experienced complete or partial remissions after discontinuing HCTZ. A monoclonal T cell receptor rearrangement was detected
more frequently in the hypertensive stage I patients not taking HCTZ as compared with those who were (55.3% vs 69.1%, P ¼ .032).
Three patients were rechallenged and developed MF lesions that resolved or improved with discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: HCTZ is
commonly prescribed and may be a putative antigen in a small subset of early MF patients. Careful drug histories and a trial off mediC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) are the most common cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL) and are
hypothesized to arise from memory T cells exposed to chronic antigen stimulation.1 Accumulation of effector (MF) or
central (SS) memory T cells has recently been proposed to distinguish them.2 Sézary syndrome is defined by erythroderma
and clonal expansion of central memory cells in the blood. Although MF and SS may differ in memory T cell origin, both
have associations with class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR5, DQB*03 in MF and HLA-DQ502 in SS that may
predispose patients to CTCL. Furthermore, HLA associations support the hypothesis of an antigen-driven T cell proliferation as an initiating event.2,3 When peptide antigens bound to HLA class II chains are recognized by variable region
sequences of the T cell receptor, interleukin-2 and its receptor are up-regulated, leading to clonal T cell expansion and
recruitment. Normally, activation-induced cell death, mediated through Fas/Fas ligand, will limit this immune response,
but activation-induced cell death is known to be defective in CTCL T cells.4
Although the initial triggers leading to the development of skin-homing CD4þ cells in MF and/or SS are unknown, autoantigens, environmental toxins, and infectious agents have all been hypothesized and would be expected to differ from one
patient to another. Infectious agents suggested in the past include Staphylococcus aureus, tinea, human T lymphotropic virus
type 1 or other retrovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus.5,6 In the case of Staphylococcus aureus, SS patients were demonstrated to have clonal expansion of the Vb chains in blood expected for the type of S. aureus colonizing the patients.5 Drugs previously reported to be associated with CTCL include antihistamines, antiepileptics,
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and antihypertensives (ie, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors).7-9 Exposure to chemicals and solvents are also reported in patients who developed MF.10
Our clinical observation of individual patients whose MF and/or SS was preceded by use of the common diuretic
hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), and that a significant number of CTCL patients gave a history of taking HCTZ, led us to

prospectively query each new patient specifically for this
exposure history. We also found patients whose CTCL
initially worsened after they were placed on the medication and patients who improved when they discontinued
this medication. Although Fischmann et al,10 in 1979,
first suggested thiazides were a class of drugs that might be
associated with MF and/or SS, that observation was not
further investigated until this study. To date, there are no
other published reports of the correlation of HCTZ to the
development of CTCL. We now report the association
of HCTZ with CTCL in a case series and prospectively
collected, large cohort of patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To study risk factors associated with CTCL, we established a prospective Microsoft Access database consisting
of all new patients evaluated and staged between 1987
and 2011 with a confirmed diagnosis of either MF or SS
variants of CTCL. All patients provided written consent
to participate, provided a complete history on a standardized form, and agreed to have blood samples taken for
sera, DNA, and in some cases tissue banking. All patients
had skin biopsies reviewed as diagnostic of MF and/or
SS (that is, CTCL). All patients underwent full physical
examinations including blood pressure and skinweighted assessment of extent of their disease using body
surface area (BSA) measurements or the modified severity-weighted assessment tool (mSWAT). New or recent
skin biopsies, including immunohistochemistry and molecular studies, were required to confirm the diagnosis
and were interpreted by a dermatopathologist or hematopathologist. The presence of a monoclonal T cell population in lesional biopsy was determined by polymerase
chain reaction using primers for the gamma and beta T

cell receptor (TCR) and is reported for stage I hypertensive patients on and off HCTZ, when available.
The Microsoft Access database included records of
1443 patients evaluated at our center between 1987 and
2011. CTCL patients were divided into 2 major groups: 1)
hypertensive patients on HCTZ (HTN plus HCTZ) and
2) hypertensive patients not taking HCTZ (HTN w/o
HCTZ). The diagnosis of hypertension was based on the
Joint National Committee’s Seventh Edition Report11: specifically a systolic blood pressure recording of > 140 mm
Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 90 mm Hg. Also included
were patients who had a self-reported history of hypertension requiring medication or patients who were currently
on an antihypertensive for hypertension. The list of
HCTZ-containing drugs is shown in Table 1. Manual
chart review revealed that 815 of 1443 CTCL patients had
hypertension. The records of these hypertensive patients
were reviewed to identify their drug exposure. Patients on
HCTZ at the time of CTCL diagnosis were identified for
further study. The temporal relationship of HCTZ to the
appearance of CTCL lesions and the effect of discontinuing
the drug were analyzed overall and in individual patients.
Diagnosis of early MF was determined using the clinical
and histological criteria outlined by Pimpinelli et al.12
The Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Probability Scale was used to rate each of the individual cases presented.13 This scale is widely used in clinical practice and in
ADR reporting in the attempt to objectively assess reactions
using a validated, reproducible scale with high inter- and
intrarater agreement.14 It encompasses a 10-item probability scale that assigns a score of 1 to þ2 to each question
related to causality (Table 2). A sum of the scores of 9 or 10
indicate that an event was definitely an ADR; scores of 5 to
8 rate the likelihood as probable; scores of 1 to 4 are

RESULTS
Of 1443 CTCL patients with either MF or SS, 815
(56.5%) reported a history of hypertension at initial staging. A total of 205 patients (25.6%) of the 815 hypertensive

were 108 (53%) females and 97 (47%) males in the MF
plus HCTZ hypertensive patient population, and there
were 237 (39%) females and 374 (61%) males in the MF
w/o HCTZ patient population. The chi-square test indicated that the MF plus HCTZ patient population had a
statistically higher proportion of females compared to the
MF w/o HCTZ patient population (P < .001). The ethnic

2.4% other and was similar to the HTN w/o HCTZ group
(P ¼ .843). A summary of the demographic and clinical
information of the patients is shown in Table 3.
The mean age of patients on HCTZ was 62.4 
11.4, and this was statistically higher than the patients off
HCTZ whose median age was 60.0  14.7 years (P ¼
.019). There was a significant association between stage of
diagnosis and being on HCTZ (P ¼ .006; Fig. 1). Seventyseven percent of the patients on HCTZ were stage I, early
MF. When comparing patients who were stage I to those
who were stages II, III, and IV, the odds ratio in stage IV
was 0.45 (95% CI 0.25-0.78, P ¼ .0037), demonstrating
reduced likelihood of being stage IV in patients on HCTZ.
A total of 125 of the 196 MF patients taking HCTZ
(63.8%) had started it prior to developing skin lesions or
symptoms of CTCL and were therefore of interest to
examine for causality. For 19 patients, no data was available regarding timing of HCTZ use. The median duration of HCTZ treatment prior to a biopsy diagnosis of
CTCL was 4 years (range, 0-30 years). Of the patients

who started HCTZ before onset of symptoms or signs of
CTCL, 35 (28.0%) had begun the drug within the year
prior to developing their first skin rash. In addition, there
were 13 patients of the 64 (20.3%) whose CTCL had preceded their HCTZ therapy, but whose rash worsened significantly when HCTZ was started. Notably, 36 of the
125 (28.8%) patients who had taken HCTZ before they
developed MF experienced complete resolution or
marked improvement of their lesions after stopping
HCTZ therapy. TCR rearrangement data was available
for 85 hypertensive stage I patients on HCTZ and for 223
patients who were not taking it. There was a statistically
higher proportion of monoclonality in the patients not
taking HCTZ, as determined by Fisher’s exact test (P ¼
.032; Table 3, bottom). There were 3 patients (cases 1-3)
who, after being accidentally rechallenged with HCTZ by
their primary care physician, had relapse of their MF
lesions, confirmed by biopsy and fitting criteria for early
MF proposed by Pimpinelli et al (Table 4).12 We also
report 1 case who demonstrated the rapid improvement
seen in some of our patients who discontinued HCTZ.
Case Studies

Figure 1. Stage comparison is shown for hypertensive cutaneous T cell lymphoma patients who were on (MF HTN þHCTZ)
and off (MF HTN HCTZ) hydrochlorothiazide. Chi-square for
the overall association between stage and HCTZ status was
significant at p ¼ 0.006. Note that Sézary syndrome patients
are included in the IVA/B grouping.

Case 1. A 77-year-old Caucasian woman with erythrodermic MF (stage III) had started HCTZ 4 years before she
was diagnosed with granulomatous MF in 1995. Her rash
originally started on the proximal thighs and abdomen as
pruritic pink plaques which progressed through treatment
with topical and oral steroids over a 5-month period.
Biopsies showed an atypical lymphoid infiltrate in the epidermis, superficial dermis, and a deeper infiltrate that also
had multinucleated giant cells. There was loss of CD7 and
no clonal rearrangement was detected. She was on no
other medications. The patient was asked to stop HCTZ,
and her erythroderma and pruritus resolved completely 2
months later with 3 sessions of photopheresis and topical
nitrogen mustard (Mustargen; Lundbeck, Deerfield, Ill).
She was restaged as T0 in 2001 and was disease-free until
2005. Four months after restarting HCTZ, her MF

relapsed with large plaques over her lower extremities. Biopsy showed well-developed Pautrier’s abscesses and a
dense superficial, perivascular, and epidermotropic infiltrate composed of small irregular lymphocytes. HCTZ
was discontinued and the rash resolved in 2 months with
topical steroids. Using the Naranjo ADR Probability Scale
for drug reactions, this case was scored with 7 points correlating to a probable relation between HCTZ use and development of CTCL.
Case 2. A 71-year-old Caucasian man began oral
HCTZ for 4 years prior to being diagnosed with plaque
MF T2 in 2004. The lesions began on his lateral abdomen
and buttocks. Lesional biopsy showed a superficial infiltrate composed of atypical lymphocytes with epidermotropism. The CD4-to-CD8 ratio was > 10:1. At baseline
staging, MF lesions were present on 30% of his BSA, and
after stopping the HCTZ, his BSA was down to 8.5% on
return visit. When he restarted HCTZ, new lesions
appeared with a BSA of 21%. Using the Naranjo ADR
Probability Scale for drug reactions, this case was scored
with 5 points correlating to a probable relation between
hydrochlorothiazide and development of CTCL.
Case 3. A 75-year-old African American man first
developed a rash on his legs and thigh in 1995. Several skin
biopsies done in 2001 and 2003 were negative for CTCL
and were interpreted as lichenoid drug reaction without
TCR gene rearrangements. In 2004, he was started on
HCTZ, and noted that his rash spread widely over his trunk
and thicker plaques developed. Repeat lesional skin biopsy
showed an atypical lymphocytic infiltrate with epidermotropism of CD3þ cells and an epidermal CD4/CD8 ratio
of 3:1 consistent with MF. After he discontinued HCTZ,
his BSA involvement decreased from 39% to 0.6% with no
significant change in treatment. His internist put him back
on HCTZ and the disease again flared with 33% body surface area involvement. Using the Naranjo ADR Probability
Scale for drug reactions, this case was scored with 5 points
correlating to a probable relation between hydrochlorothiazide and development of CTCL.
Case 4. A 61-year-old African American female
developed a red pruritic rash on the right posterior flank
in 2004 within 1 year of starting HCTZ. The rash spread
over the following months to her medial thighs, buttocks,
and upper arms. She had failed multiple topical therapies
over a 2-year period including antifungal therapies and
high-potency topical steroids. Two prior biopsies showed
spongiotic dermatitis. In 2006, a lesional biopsy from her
posterior thigh showed a band-like atypical lymphoid
cellular infiltrate with epidermotropism. There was
fibrosis noted at the dermal-epidermal junction, some

parakaratosis, and a lack of spongiosis. She was instructed
to discontinue the HCTZ, started ultraviolet B (UVB)
treatment 3 times per week, and went into clinical remission. She was titrated off the UVB and continues to be in
remission 5 years from her initial presentation.
DISCUSSION
Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is a thiazide diuretic commonly prescribed to hypertensive adults. In this cohort
with a mean age of 62.4 years, 14.2% percent of all our
CTCL patients and 25.2% of hypertensive CTCL
patients were taking HCTZ, in contrast to the 5.8% rate
of usage in the general population.15 The advanced age of
MF and/or SS patients may certainly contribute to the
high incidence of hypertension and HCTZ use in this
cohort. HCTZ has been marketed under at least 7 different trade names in the United States and is found in more
than 30 combination formulations with other antihypertensives (Table 1). Previously described drug reactions to
HCTZ include lichenoid dermatitis, angioedema, pityriasis rosea-like eruptions, acute generalized exanthematous
pustulosis (AGEP), phototoxic/allergic eruption, erythema multiforme, and allergic vasculitis.16-20
Although HCTZ use is high in CTCL patients, this
does not prove causality. However, our study reveals an
interesting relationship between the two. First, of CTCL
patients with HTN taking HCTZ, 65% either started the
drug prior to developing MF or their MF increased in severity once they started HCTZ. Furthermore, we have shown
that discontinuation of HCTZ in some patients was associated with clearing or improvement of their MF lesions.
Finally, a subset of patients experiencing clinical remission
or decreased MF activity with HCTZ cessation, when
rechallenged, had MF recurrence or an exacerbation of existing disease. In 3 of our 4 case histories, the Naranjo ADR
Probability Scale showed a probable association (scores in
the range 5-8) with HCTZ. The fourth case scored as a possible association due to the lack of rechallenge data.
There may be some who argue that HCTZ is causing a ‘‘drug rash that looks like MF.’’ However, if CTCL
is an antigen-driven immune response generating epidermotropic helper/memory cells, could not HCTZ then
function as the inciting antigen? Whether our patients
had ‘‘real MF’’ or an MF-like drug reaction is a semantic
argument. The MF lesions in patients taking HCTZ fulfilled both the clinical and histologic features of MF proposed by Pimpinelli et al for early MF.12 Over time, the
accumulation of antigen driven, clonally expanded T cells
would be expected to develop new mutations favoring
enhanced proliferation and survival, and hence
829

lymphoma, as the point of no return. This idea is corroborated by our data showing that the patients on HCTZ had
statistically lower rates of monoclonality in their biopsies
than the non-HCTZ patients while meeting clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical criteria of CTCL,
suggesting they may be in a gray area between druginduced rash and lymphoma. The fewer monoclonal rearrangements may also explain why patients on HCTZ
were found to have a lower odds ratio of being in later
stages, ie, stage IV, versus those not taking HCTZ as the
extent of monoclonality has been shown to be helpful in
not only distinguishing MF from inflammatory conditions, but also in predicting progression of disease.21
Therefore, discontinuation of an MF causing antigen,
once the process is initiated and a monoclonal population
established, would not be expected to always result in
complete remission whereas removal of a drug rash antigen should always lead to complete remission of the rash.
We were somewhat surprised at the high incidence
of hypertension found in CTCL patients as well as new
data suggesting that the T lymphocyte may participate in
the pathogenesis of hypertension. Guzik et al reported
that RAG-1/ mice, lacking T and B cells, have a
blunted hypertensive response to infusion of angiotensin
II, but respond appropriately with reintroduction of T
cells but not B cells.22 The same study also found that
angiotension II increased T cell proliferation, cytokine
production, and tissue specific homing, which, the
authors postulate, may amplify immune responses in various organs including the skin. The mean incidence of
HTN among this CTCL study cohort was 56.5% compared to 48.0% of similarly aged non-CTCL cohort.23
Thus, there may be a previously unreported comorbidity
between CTCL and hypertension that merits further
investigation.
Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) or 6-chloro-3,4dihydro-2H-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide 1,1dioxide is a sulfonamide derivative with a phenol group
and substituted chlorine moiety. Although slightly soluble
in water, it predominantly distributes to the extracellular
fluid compartment.24 The chlorine atom in HCTZ,
which has the potential to act as an antigen, may be dissociated by UVB, creating a free radical that can react with
lipids, proteins, and DNA, creating novel keratinocyte
antigens. The metabolite formation or chlorine release
may also explain the propensity of HCTZ to cause a variety of skin rashes upon light exposure.25-27 Westman et al
found that exposure of Lewis rats to chlorinated type II
collagen induced arthritis, whereas nonchlorinated forms
of the same antigen failed to cause arthritis.28 We specu830

late that chlorine from HCTZ or from HCTZ metabolites formed in the skin could create new epidermal
antigens that could elicit an inappropriate T cell response
such as MF.
Conclusions

Although Tan et al hypothesized that MF results from
chronic antigen stimulation, the antigens have not been
identified and are likely to differ from one patient to the
next.1 Based on a high prevalence of HCTZ use among
CTCL patients as well as temporal relationship and clinical improvement in anecdotal patients, we propose that
HCTZ may be acting as an antigenic trigger for MF in a
small subset of patients. A careful, detailed drug history is
important in evaluating patients presenting with CTCL.
For early-stage patients whose HCTZ preceded their skin
disease, discontinuation of HCTZ use is warranted.
