Abstract
We previously showed that cancer cells from papillary,
follicular, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas produce interleukin-4 and interleukin-10, which counteract the cytotoxic
activity of conventional chemotherapy through the upregulation of antiapoptotic molecules. Here, we identify Janus
kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription
(STAT) and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT as the
down-stream pathways through which these cytokines confer
resistance to cell death in thyroid cancer. We found that the
absence of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) molecules
allows the propagation of the survival signaling. Exogenous
expression of SOCS1, SOCS3, and SOCS5 in the highly
aggressive anaplastic thyroid cancer cells reduces or abolishes
STAT3 and 6 phosphorylation and PI3K/Akt pathway activation resulting in alteration in the balance of proapoptotic and
antiapoptotic molecules and sensitization to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. Likewise, exogenous expression of SOCS3
significantly reduces tumor growth and potently enhances the
efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo. Our results indicate that
SOCS3 regulation of cytokines-prosurvival programs might
represent a new strategy to overcome the resistance to
chemotherapy-induced cell death of thyroid cancer. [Cancer

Introduction
Thyroid carcinomas are the most common endocrine tumors in
humans, with a globally increasing incidence. Differentiated
tumors, such as papillary (PTC) and follicular (FTC) thyroid
cancers, are often curable with surgical resection and radiotherapy
(1), whereas undifferentiated (anaplastic) thyroid carcinoma (UTC)
is invariably lethal, due to the high invasiveness and insensitivity
to radioiodine or chemotherapeutic treatment. We previously
reported that autocrine production of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10
promotes thyroid cancer resistance to death ligand– and chemotherapy-induced cell death (2, 3). Subsequently, we showed that
IL-4 and to a lesser extent IL-10, are also responsible for the growth
and resistance to cell death of cancer cells from colon, breast, and
lung primary tumors (4, 5).

IL-4 signaling propagates through two related pathways. One
is initiated with recruitment to IL-4 receptor a (IL-4Ra) of signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6, following
activation of Janus kinase (JAK) 1; the other involves recruitment to
the IL-4Ra of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2, and to a lesser
extent IRS-1) with consequential recruitment of phosphatidyl
inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), generation of phosphoinositides, and
activation of downstream kinases (i.e., Akt) critically involved in
cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis (6). IL-10 receptor
(IL-10R) activates JAK1, which in turn initiates phosphorylation
of the IL-10Ra leading to STAT3 activation (7). Moreover, there is
evidence to suggest that JAK1 phosphorylates IRS-1 docking
molecule following interaction with IL-10 with its corresponding
receptor. Therefore, activation of PI3K/Akt pathway can occur also
following IL-10R triggering (8).
Activated STATs dimerize and migrate to the nucleus, where
they activate the transcription of specific genes among which are
members of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family
(9). SOCS family consists of eight members sharing a central Srchomology 2 domain and a 40 residue COOH-terminal motif
called the SOCS box. The Src-homology 2 domain allows
different SOCS proteins to bind to specific phosphotyrosines
and inhibit cytokine signaling in a classic negative feedback loop,
which involves the interaction with cytokine receptors and/or
receptor-associated JAKs with consequent inhibition of kinase
activity (10). SOCS box is believed to be involved in the
degradation of proteins through the ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal pathway (10). Among SOCS molecules, SOCS1, SOCS3, and
SOCS5 are mainly involved in the regulation of IL-4 and IL-10
pathways. Both SOCS1 and SOCS3 inhibit JAK tyrosine kinase
activity through the kinase inhibitory region at their NH2
terminus (11). SOCS1 directly binds to the activation loop of
JAKs through the Src-homology 2 domain, whereas SOCS3 can
inhibit the action of JAK only in the presence of a receptor to
which it is believed to bind (11). Studies with SOCS1- or SOCS3deficient mice indicate that SOCS1 is primarily a negative
regulator of IFN-g signaling (12), whereas SOCS3 is primarily a
negative regulator of IL-6 signaling (11). However, both SOCS1
and SOCS3 can be activated by IL-4 or IL-10 and function as
potent inhibitors of IL-4/STAT6 or IL-10/STAT3 activation (13).
Although SOCS5 function is less clear, it is believed to inhibit
IL-4 signaling by binding to the IL-4Ra chain and preventing the
interaction with JAK1 (14).
Herein, we found that resistance to chemotherapy in thyroid
cancer directly correlates with down-regulation of SOCS molecules.
Exogenous expression of SOCS family members in UTC results in
growth arrest of a considerable percentage of cells and sensitization of the residual tumor population to cytotoxic drugs.

Materials and Methods
Specimens. Thyroid tissues were obtained from surgical removal from
patients affected by PTC (n = 10; age, 47 F 4 y), FTC (n = 10; age, 55 F 3 y),
and UTC (n = 5; age, 68 F 7 y), in accordance with the ethical standards of
the Institutional Responsible Committee on human experimentation.
Control thyroid specimens were obtained from the uninvolved lobes of
tumor-affected glands (n = 10; age, 58 F 10 y). Tumor diagnosis was
assessed on the bases of the peculiar histologic features.
Cell purification and culture. Purification of normal and cancer
thyroid cells was performed as previously described (2). Fresh epithelial
thyroid cells were purified from the digested tumor specimens by
hematopoietic cell depletion with anti-CD45 double magnetic bead passage
(MACS; Miltenyi Biotec) and red cells lysis. UTC-adherent cell population
was obtained after three culture passages of CD45-depleted thyroid tumor
cells in the presence of DMEM (EuroClone Ltd.) with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories). Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers were isolated from heparinized blood
by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation. For cytokine stimulation, normal
thyrocytes, anaplastic thyroid cancer cells, and PBMCs were exposed to
human recombinant IL-4 (20 ng/mL) and IL-10 (40 ng/mL) for 24 h in RPMI
1640 (Euroclone).
Protein isolation and immunoblotting. Cell pellets were resuspended
in ice-cold NP40 lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA, and 1% NP40] containing proteases and
phosphatases inhibitors as previously described (2). Lysates were fractioned
on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted to nitrocellulose. Membranes were
blocked for 1 h with nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and
successively incubated with antibodies specific for phospho-Jak1 [3331,

Membranes were then washed, incubated for 1 h with horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, or anti-goat immunoglobulins (Amersham Biosciences UK Limited), and developed with a chemiluminescence detection system (SuperSignal West Pico/Dura Extended
duration Substrate; Pierce Biotechnology).
Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, H&E, Azan Mallory,
and in situ TUNEL. Stainings were performed on 6-Am-thick paraffinembedded sections of human thyroid tissues and of tumor xenografts, on
thyroid cell monolayers and on cytospun thyroid cancer cells. Sections or
monolayers were incubated with 1% human serum from AB donors for
20 min to block unspecific staining, followed by incubation with specific
antibodies against phospho-Akt (4051, Ser 473, 587F11 mouse IgG2b; CST),
phospho-GSK3h (9336, Ser9, rabbit polyclonal; CST), nuclear factor-nB

polyclonal; CST), phospho-STAT3 (9131, Tyr705, rabbit polyclonal; CST),
or isotype-matched controls for 1 h at room temperature. Then, sections or
monolayers were washed in TBS, incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse or
anti-rabbit immunoglobulins for 30 min, and treated with streptavidinperoxidase (LSAB 2 kit; Dako Corporation). Stainings were revealed using
3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (red color) substrate and counterstained with
aqueous hematoxylin (blue color). For immunofluorescence, cytospun
thyroid cancer cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at

cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Quantitative Taqman PCR analysis was performed with the
ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystem) in a
reaction volume of 25 AL containing 1 TaqmanUniversal Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) and 1 probes and primer sets Hs00705164_s1
(SOCS1; Taqman Gene Expression Assays, Applied Biosystems),
Hs00269575_s1 (SOCS3; Taqman Gene Expression Assays, Applied Biosystems), Hs00751962_s1 (SOCS5; Taqman Gene Expression Assays, Applied
Biosystems), or 1 Hu glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; PreDeveloped Taqman Assay Reagents; Applied Biosystems). The thermal profile
was follows: 95jC for 10 min and 35 cycles at 95jC for 15 s and 60jC for 1 min.
All amplification reactions were done in triplicate, and the relative quantitation
of SOCS genes expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method
(DDCt). Levels of mRNA expression were expressed after normalization with
endogenous control, GAPDH. Data processing and statistical analysis were
performed using the ABI PRISM SDS, software version 2.1 (Applied Biosystems).
Production of lentiviral particles and infection. Full-length cDNA
clones for SOCS1 (IRAKp961J1182Q), SOCS3 (IRAKp961B21133Q), and
SOCS5 (DKFZp434C198Q) were purchased from ImaGenes GmbH requiring
EST sequences verification. HA-tagged AktK179M was kindly provided by
Prof. G.L. Condorelli (Laboratory of Genetic and Molecular Cardiology,
Scientific and Technology Pole, IRCCS MultiMedica, Milan, Italy). Gene
transfer was performed using TWEEN lentiviral vector containing the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) as reporter gene. SOCS1, 3, 5, and AktK179M cDNAs
were subcloned in EcoRV site of the vector. Lentiviral supernatants were
collected following 48-h transfection of the packaging human embryonic
kidney cell line HEK-293T using calcium phosphate. Then, 105 dissociated
UTC cells were exposed to 1 mL of viral supernatant of empty vector,
SOCS1, SOCS3, SOCS5, or AktK179M, for 40 min by centrifugating at 800 rpm,
in the presence of 8 Ag/mL polybrene to improve infection efficiency. After
three cycles of infection, cells were washed and cultured in fresh medium.
Infection efficiency was evaluated after 72 h by monitoring GFP expression,
by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), or by immunoblot analyses.
Reverse-transcription PCR. Oligonucleotide primers for RT-PCR were
designed according to the published sequences (Genbank Accession

numbers : SOCS1, NM_003745.1; SOCS3, NM_003955.3; SOCS5,
NM_194449.2; GAPDH, NM_002046). The primers used were as follows:

GGT GA-3¶; GAPDH reverse primer (1060-1079), 5¶-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG
CTG TA-3¶. RT-PCR was performed using the following conditions: SOCS1:
95jC for 1 min, 53jC for 45 s, 72jC for 1 min, 30 cycles; SOCS3: 95jC for
1 min, 52jC for 45 s, 72jC for 45 s, 30 cycles; SOCS5: 95jC for 1 min and
30 s, 59jC for 45 s, 72jC for 1 min and 30 s, 30 cycles; GAPDH: 95jC for 30 s,
53jC for 30 s, 72jC for 1 min, 30 cycles.
Cell viability. Cell viability was evaluated in UTC cells transduced with
empty vector, SOCS1, SOCS3, or SOCS5 and treated with Taxol (5 Amol/L;
Sigma) or Doxorubicin (5 Amol/L; Sigma), for 24, 48, or 72 h. The number of
viable cells was detected using CellTiter Aqueous Assay kit (Promega
Corporation) accordingly to manufacturer’s instructions. HuT78 cells
plated at 2  105/mL and treated with an agonistic anti-CD95 antibody
(CH-11; 200 ng/mL) were used as a positive control for cell death measurement. Death of empty vector, SOCS1, SOCS3, or SOCS5 after treatment
with chemotherapeutic agents was also analyzed by ethidium bromide
staining.
Transfections. Normal thyrocytes were cultured in six-well plates for
12 h before transfection with antisense RNA oligonucleotides directed to
SOCS1 (5¶-CTACCTGAGCTCCTTCCCCTTTTTT-3¶) or SOCS3 (5¶-AAGACCCAGTCTGGGACCAAGAATTTTTT-3¶) or with a scrambled control oligonucleotide (5¶-Fluoro-GAAGTTGAATTCAAGTCGACTTTTTT-3¶) by using
FuGENE 6 Reagent (Roche). Transfection efficiency was verified by
monitoring fluorescent signal from cells transfected with the scramble
oligonucleotide and by RT-PCR for SOCS1 or SOCS3.
Animals and tumor model. Five- to 6-wk-old female athymic (nu+/nu+)
mice, obtained from Charles River Laboratories, were used. Mice were
maintained according to institutional guidelines of animal care and

committee. UTC cells (5  105) transduced with empty vector and SOCS3
were suspended in 200 AL of PBS and s.c. injected on both flanks of nude
mice. After 7 d, when tumors were established, six mice per group were
treated i.p. with Taxol, Doxorubicin, or 0.02% DMSO as control. Drugs were
injected on days 1 and 3 of a 7-d cycle for four cycles at the concentration of
10 Amol/L in 200 AL for Taxol and 4 mg/Kg in 200 AL for Doxorubicin, of
DMEM containing 0.02% DMSO. Tumor mass size was calculated weekly up
to 4 wk according to the formula: (k/6)  larger diameter  (smaller
diameter)2.
Statistical analysis. Data of cell viability were analyzed by one-way
unpaired ANOVA followed by a Student’s t test to determine individual
differences between TWEEN and SOCS1, TWEEN and SOCS3, TWEEN and
SOCS5, and SOCS3 and SOCS5-infected UTC cells. P values of <0.05 were
considered significant. Intensity of band signals in exposed film was
determined by densitometric scanning and analyzed using NIH IMAGE
software version 1.62 (by Wayne Rasband, NIH, Research Services Branch,
NIMH). Results were expressed as protein/h-actin absorbance ratio.

Results
JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt pathways are activated in thyroid
cancer cells. To elucidate the mechanisms through which IL-4/IL10 control resistance to cell death stimuli in thyroid cancer, we first
investigated the activation of JAK/STAT and PI3K/Akt pathways
in freshly purified thyroid cancer cells through the analysis of the

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

phosphorylation levels of their target components. Immunoblot
analysis revealed that phosphorylated JAK1 (pJAK1), STAT6
(pSTAT6), and STAT3 (pSTAT3) were highly expressed in all
histologic subtypes of thyroid cancer examined (PTC, FTC, and
UTC) compared with normal thyroid cells (Fig. 1A). Similarly,
purified thyroid cancer cells showed increased levels of phosphorylated forms of Akt (pAkt) and glycogen synthase kinase-3h
(pGSK3h) when compared with normal thyrocytes, both by
immunoblot (Fig. 1A) and immunohistochemistry analysis (Fig. 1B).
Phosphorylation of GSK3h by Akt renders GSK3h inactive
avoiding as a consequence cyclin D1 turnover (15). Akt regulates
cell division also by inactivating p27kip1 either by regulating its
mRNA expression or by controlling its subcellular localization
(16, 17). Accordingly, immunoblot analysis revealed increased
expression levels of cyclin D1 in tumoral versus normal thyroid
cells, whereas p27Kip1 was down-regulated in all the histotypes of
thyroid carcinoma (Fig. 1C).
We additionally found that the phosphorylated IKKa/h kinase
and its target InB-a were increased in thyroid cancer cells (Fig. 1C),
and that NF-nB immunolocalized in the nuclei of purified PTC,
FTC, and UTC cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that in thyroid cancer cells
the activation of Akt cascade results in the enhancement of the
NF-nB activity.
Thyroid cancer cells express low levels of SOCS family
members. Because loss of expression of SOCS molecules has been
reported in several human malignancies (18–22), we tested whether
this could be the case of thyroid tumors, whose cytokine pathways
were previously shown constitutively activated. For such purpose,
purified epithelial cells from 10 PTC, 10 FTC, and 5 UTC, previously
examined for positivity to IL-4 and IL-10 (data not shown), were
analyzed by Real-Time PCR analysis for mRNA expression of
SOCS1, SOCS3, and SOCS5, potent inhibitors of JAK/STAT
activation. Similarly to control PBMCs, normal thyrocytes constitutively expressed the three SOCS molecules, which further
increased in the presence of IL-4 and IL-10. In contrast, the
expression of SOCS1, SOCS3, and SOCS5 was very low in thyroid
cancer cells and not altered by cytokine exposure in the less
differentiated hystotype (Fig. 2A).
Because of the three hystotypes analyzed, the anaplastic is the
variant with the poorest prognosis, we aimed at testing whether
exogenous expression of SOCS molecules could sensitize its cells to
death both in in vitro and in vivo. Primary adherent cells are not
tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice. Therefore, we purified
thyroid cancer cells by depleting leucocytes and red cells from
enzymatically dissociated UTCs and confirm their tumor-initiating
capacity by s.c. injection in nude mice (Fig. 2B). Although UTC cells
loose the tumorigenic potential after three in vitro passages, freshly
isolated cells maintained a consistent tumorigenic activity in
immunocompromised mice (Fig. 2B), confirming the possibility to
obtain tumor xenografts without using classic cell lines. Moreover,
immunofluorescence analysis revealed that IL-4, IL-10, and their
respective receptors were present in freshly isolated thyroid cancer
cells (Fig. 2C), in line with the hypothesis that the higher resistance
to death of these cells could be due to IL-4/IL-10 activated
pathways not counterbalanced by SOCS negative regulation.
SOCS1, SOCS3, and SOCS5 promote sensitization to chemotherapy through alteration of the Bcl-2 family members. To
determine the ability of SOCS1, SOCS3, and SOCS5 to sensitize
UTC cells to standard chemotherapy, we exogenously expressed
SOCS genes by transducing freshly isolated UTC cells with
lentiviral vectors carrying the GFP as reporter gene and SOCS1,

SOCS3, or SOCS5, or only GFP (TWEEN) as control. The efficiency
of gene delivery was verified by monitoring GFP expression (data
not shown) and by RT-PCR analysis for SOCS genes (Fig. 3A).
We then confirmed the functional blockade of JAK/STAT
signaling pathway in transduced cells by evaluating STAT6 and
STAT3 phosphorylation levels. As shown in Fig. 3B and C,
phosphorylation of STAT6 and STAT3 was reduced in SOCS1infected cells and completely abolished by expression of SOCS3 or
SOCS5. Similarly, phosphorylation levels of Akt and GSK3h were
reduced in SOCS3 and SOCS5-infected cells, whereas p27Kip1 was
increased following their delivery (Fig. 3C). Moreover, NF-nB was
found mainly in the cytoplasm of SOCS3 and SOCS5-infected cells,
whereas localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of empty
vector or SOCS1-infected cells (Fig. 3B). As a consequence, a
significant reduction of UTC cell growth was observed (Fig. 4A),
confirming the role of the JAK/STAT and PI3k/Akt pathways in
thyroid cancer growth. To investigate the involvement of such
pathway in UTC survival, cell viability of TWEEN, SOCS1, SOCS3, or
SOCS5-infected cells exposed to Taxol or Doxorubicin for up to
72 hours was measured. We found that the expression of SOCS1,
SOCS3, or SOCS5 sensitized UTC cells to chemotherapy-induced
cell death (Fig. 4B). Although SOCS1-expressing UTC cells died
moderately after exposure to drugs, SOCS3 expression was

particularly effective in sensitizing UTC cells to chemotherapy,
even more than SOCS5 after 24 and 72 hours of Taxol treatment or
24 hours of Doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 4B). Similar results were
obtained by ethidium bromide staining (Fig. 4C). Altogether, these
data indicate that JAK/STAT and PI3k/Akt pathways activation
plays a major role in determining refractoriness of UTC cells to
apoptotic stimuli because their blockade was able to restore the
sensitivity to drug-induced death. To determine whether the
increased sensitivity of UTC cells to chemotherapy promoted by
SOCS proteins was related to the down-modulation of antiapoptotic molecules, we evaluated the expression of several proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins in UTC cells transduced with
SOCS1, SOCS3, or SOCS5. We found alterations in Bak, Mcl-1, Noxa,
Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, pBad, but not in Bax expression levels. In agreement
with the survival data, SOCS3 and SOCS5 were able to produce the
most significant alterations increasing the levels of Bak, Noxa, and
the proapoptotic Mcl-1 short isoform (Mcl-1S), and reducing the
expression of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 long isoform (Mcl-1L)
Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and pBad, whereas SOCS1 seemed to exert little
or no effect (Fig. 4D ).
SOCS molecules control the expression levels of Bcl-xL
through Akt down-modulation. To understand whether SOCS
molecules control directly Bcl-2 family members’ expression levels

silencing on Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression in normal thyrocytes.
Transfection efficiency was verified by monitoring fluorescent
signals from thyrocytes transfected with scramble control oligonucleotide (scramble) and by RT-PCR for SOCS1 or SOCS3 in cells
transfected with antisense RNA oligonucleotide directed to SOCS1
(SOCS1 AS) or SOCS3 (SOCS3 AS; Fig. 5C). Silencing of SOCS3 but
not of SOCS1 resulted in increased Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 levels (Fig. 5D),
confirming that SOCS3 controls the expression of both proteins in
thyroid cells.
SOCS3 promotes in vivo sensitization to chemotherapyinduced cell death. Our in vitro data suggested that among
the SOCS molecules analyzed, SOCS3 has major effect in restoring
the sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced cell death in UTC cells.
We therefore s.c. injected into nude mice UTC cells transduced
with SOCS3-encoding or empty lentiviral vectors. After 7 days,
mice were treated i.p. with Taxol, Doxorubicin, or DMSO as
control. Interestingly, administration of Taxol or Doxorubicin to
mice bearing tumors generated by SOCS3-transduced UTC cells
dramatically reduced tumor growth up to 28 days (Fig. 6A). The
extent of tumor growth inhibition obtained by Taxol or Doxorubicin
treatment in xenografts generated by vector-transduced UTC cells
was comparable with that induced by the sole expression of SOCS3
in the absence of the chemotherapic agent. Remarkably, Taxol or
Doxorubicin treatment in the presence of SOCS3 expression
resulted in a 3-fold decrease of tumor size compared with untreated
control xenografts, and in a 2-fold decrease compared with either
single chemotherapy or SOCS3 xenografts (Fig. 6A). Furthermore,
H&E and A.M. stainings showed that residual tumors of the SOCS3transduced UTC group treated with Taxol or Doxorubicin were
largely fibrotic (Fig. 6B). TUNEL analysis confirmed that Taxol or
Doxorubicin barely induced cell death in empty vector–transduced
UTC cell–derived xenografts, whereas SOCS3 delivery enhanced the
effect of chemotherapy leading to a significant increase of apoptotic
events readily detectable in the few remaining cancer cells among
the fibrotic areas (Fig. 6B). Moreover, phosphorylation of STAT6 and
STAT3 was detected in the residual tumors of the empty vector–
transduced UTC group but not in the group that has received
SOCS3-transduced UTC cells (Fig. 6B). These results clearly
indicate the promising effect of SOCS3 delivery in the treatment
of UTC, suggesting that interfering simultaneously with IL-4 and
IL-10 function could represent a novel way to reduce cell survival
and refractoriness of UTC cells to conventional therapy.

Discussion

or indirectly through the Akt pathway, we expressed in UTC cells
the HA-tagged AktK179M, a kinase-defective Akt mutant. The
efficiency of gene delivery was verified by immunoblot analysis
for HA (Fig. 5A). Moreover, we confirmed the functional blockade
of Akt signaling pathway in AktK179M–transduced cells by
evaluating GSK3h phosphorylation levels both by immunoblot
and immunofluorescence analyses (Fig. 5A and B). Importantly, as
revealed by immunoblot analysis, Bcl-xL was significantly reduced
following inhibition of Akt kinase activity, indicating that in UTC
cells the expression of Bcl-2 family members is regulated by Akt
signaling pathway (Fig. 5A). Thus, the proapoptotic effect obtained
following SOCS gene delivery is mediated by Akt. Moreover, we
examined the effect of SOCS1 and 3 antisense oligonucleotide

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

Resistance to apoptotic stimuli of cancer cells is the basis for the
failure of conventional therapy in UTC patients and consequently
for dismal prognosis (23). It is well established that IL-4 and IL-10
are cardinal regulators of cancer cells viability through activation of
survival pathways involving cellular intermediates, i.e., Akt, which
mediates its antiapoptotic effect through phosphorylation of
multiple downstream targets involved in apoptosis regulation
(24). In thyroid cancer cells, IL-4 and IL-10 trigger the phosphorylation of STAT6 and STAT3 following JAK1 activation, and Akt
substrates include GSK-3h and IKK. The constitutive activation of
such pathways and the related refractoriness to death is likely to
depend on impaired expression of inhibitors of IL-4/IL-10 signaling,
such as SOCS 1, 3, and 5. Exogenous expression of SOCS genes is
able to reduce cell growth and sensitizes UTC cells to chemotherapeutic agents both in vitro and in vivo by influencing the balance
of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic pathways. SOCS molecules

SOCS Molecules in Thyroid Cancer

affect the expression of Bcl-2 family members by hindering Akt
activation, as suggested by the reduction in Bcl-xL expression
following forced expression of a kinase-defective Akt mutant.
Likewise, SOCS3 targeting resulted in the increase of Bcl-xL and
Bcl-2 levels in normal thyrocytes. Importantly, because p27Kip1 is
negatively regulated by activated Akt, we can speculate that its
increase after SOCS3 or 5 overexpression depends also on Akt
inhibition. This is in contradiction with previous suggestions
according which p27kip1 could be regulated by the E3 ubiquitin
ligase system, and degraded after associating with the SOCS box.
However, a direct correlation between SOCS2 and p27Kip1 has also
been described in breast carcinoma and suggests that the loss of
control of S phase entry, possibly relates to SOCS2 loss (25).
It is not clear why the three SOCS genes displayed different
ability in increasing death susceptibility. It is presumable that
despite the shared structural similarities, they regulate cytokines
signal transduction in different ways. We found that SOCS3 and 5
molecules simultaneously interfere with both JAK/STAT and PI3k/
Akt prosurvival programs. Although it cannot be excluded that
other not fully characterized members of the SOCS family could
restore thyroid cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, it
is likely that SOCS3 and 5 play a major role in the regulation of
IL-4/IL-10 pathways in thyroid cells.

In the normal rat thyroid cell line FRTL-5, TSH has been
reported to induce SOCS1 and 3 expression and to alter the
phosphorylation state of STATs (26). Therefore, SOCS expression in
normal thyrocytes not exposed to IL-4 and IL-10 may result from
TSH receptor signaling. In normal cells, SOCS genes levels are
rapidly up-regulated following cytokine stimulation and probably
degraded once the stimuli has ceased. In contrast, a decreased
TSHR expression has been observed in UTC cells and seems to be
correlated to high proliferation (27). Therefore, in such tumor
types, neither TSH nor cytokine stimulation could induce SOCS
genes transcription.
A question emerging from these data is the way to induce SOCS
molecules expression in thyroid cancer patients. Aberrant methylation of SOCS promoter genes has been reported in a variety of
human cancers and strongly correlates with reduced expression
(18–22). It is likely that this mechanism is responsible for the
absence of SOCS in tumors that maintain the expression of the
TSH receptor. Further studies could be aimed at better understanding the mechanism of SOCS genes silencing in thyroid cancer,
thus promoting the development of combination therapies with
demethylating drugs in the clinic. This might be useful also in
other cancers where such prosurvival pathways are constitutively
activated.

Our results suggest that drug resistance in thyroid cancer cells is
achieved by production of cytokines and loss of expression of
tumor suppressor genes such as SOCS. We have already shown that
IL-4 and IL-10 blockade restores the sensitivity to death in thyroid
cancer cells (2, 3). Now, we provide evidence that exogenous
expression of SOCS genes may represent another strategy to
overcome UTC refractoriness to chemotherapy. This study
identifies a second mechanism through which UTC cells escape
from death stimuli, indicating a new possible therapeutic target for
the most aggressive variant of thyroid carcinoma, which still
remains associated with a very poor prognosis.
