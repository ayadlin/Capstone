Abstract
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), the biologically active
form of vitamin D, is widely considered a promising therapy
for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on its ability to drive
differentiation of leukemic cells. However, clinical trials have
been disappointing in part to dose-limiting hypercalcemia.
Here we show how inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3
(GSK3) can improve the differentiation response of AML cells
to 1,25D-mediated differentiation. GSK3 inhibition in AML
cells enhanced the differentiating effects of low concentrations
of 1,25D. In addition, GSK3 inhibition augmented the ability
of 1,25D to induce irreversible growth inhibition and slow the

progression of AML in mouse models. Mechanistic studies
revealed that GSK3 inhibition led to the hyperphosphorylation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), enabling an interaction
between VDR and the coactivator, SRC-3 (NCOA3), thereby
increasing transcriptional activity. We also found that activation of JNK-mediated pathways in response to GSK3 inhibition contributed to the potentiation of 1,25D-induced differentiation. Taken together, our ﬁndings offer a preclinical
rationale to explore the repositioning of GSK3 inhibitors to
enhance differentiation-based therapy for AML treatment.

Introduction

APL leukemia. Because of the success of ATRA in a subtype of
AML, we and others have searched for approaches to enhance
ATRA's activity in non-APL leukemia (3). For example, inhibiting the kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) was found to
lead to a dramatic enhancement of ATRA-mediated AML differentiation due to the removal of GSK3-mediated inhibitory
phosphorylation of ATRA's receptor (4, 5). GSK3 is a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase, that is important in
signaling pathways involved in the regulation of cell fate,
protein synthesis, glycogen metabolism, cell mobility, proliferation, and survival (6–8). The strategy of combining GSK3
inhibition and ATRA for non-APL leukemia is currently under
clinical investigation (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01820624).
Similar to ATRA, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) and related analogues have widely been considered promising therapy for
cancer, particularly AML, due to their ability to differentiate
leukemic cells. Despite the high promise of 1,25D in preclinical
studies, clinical trials have been disappointing likely due to doselimiting hypercalcemia that occurs at relatively low doses (9).
Because of the role of GSK3 in ATRA differentiation, we investigated the effects of GSK3 inhibition on 1,25D differentiation.
Surprisingly, we found that GSK3 is also able to regulate 1,25Dmediated signaling but in a very different manner as ATRA
signaling. GSK3 inhibition leads to the hyperphosphorylation of
the vitamin D receptor (VDR), leading to increased differentiation. As speciﬁc GSK3 inhibitors have started to enter clinical use
for cancer, our novel approach to differentiate AML cells using low
doses of 1,25D with GSK3 inhibition has high clinical potential.

Novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed for acute
myeloid leukemia (AML). Although AML is the most common
form of acute leukemia in adults, only 20% of patients over the
age of 56 years survive 2 years (1). Despite the poor outcomes,
there has not been a change in standard AML therapy in over the
age of 40 years. The standard AML chemotherapeutics, typically an
anthracycline and cytarabine, target rapidly dividing cells instead
of the primary pathophysiology of AML, a maturation arrest.
Through targeting the differentiation arrest, myeloid leukemia
cells can be forced to mature into cells that lose their proliferative
capacity without the necessity for overt cytotoxicity. By targeting
the maturation arrest instead of rapidly dividing cells, a more
efﬁcacious and less toxic therapeutic regimen may be developed.
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an AML differentiation agent
that has revolutionized the management of an uncommon
subtype of AML, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Regimens containing ATRA lead to the long-term survival and
presumed cure of the majority of APL patients (2). Unfortunately, ATRA has not been found to be clinically useful for non-

GSK3 Regulates 1,25D-Mediated Differentiation

otherwise noted in the ﬁgures, all P values represent the
comparison of the combination treatment to treatment with
1,25D and GSK3 inhibitor alone.

Results
GSK3 inhibition sensitizes AML cells to 1,25D-mediated AML
differentiation
In order for 1,25D to be a successful clinical differentiation
agent, it is necessary to increase its activity at clinically achievable doses. As GSK3 inhibition has been shown to enhance
differentiation effects of ATRA, we investigated the combination of GSK3 inhibition with 1,25D. We found that GSK3
inhibition can signiﬁcantly sensitize AML cells to differentiate
in response to low doses of 1,25D that alone have only weak
differentiation inducing effects. Importantly, the levels of
1,25D we utilized fall within the range that have been reported
to be achievable in human trials for cancer therapy (11–13).
Several of these clinical trials have reported Cmax concentrations
in the 25 to 30 nmol/L range that corresponds to the high range
used in our studies.
Initially, the differentiation effects were assessed using the
NBT reduction assy. The NBT assay is a highly speciﬁc and
commonly used method to quantitate myeloid differentiation.
It measures functional differentiation by detecting the respiratory burst capacity, a process that only occurs in differentiated
cells (14–18). For example, in HL-60 cells (AML M2 subtype),
the combination regimen led to 92% differentiation as
opposed to 30% with a low dose of 1,25D alone and 9% with
GSK3 inhibition alone using SB (Fig. 1A). In addition to SB, a
well-characterized speciﬁc and potent GSK3 inhibitor, we also
observed similar ﬁndings with lithium, which is an FDAapproved GSK3 inhibitor (Fig. 1A).
In addition to HL-60 cells, we observed a similar ability of GSK3
inhibition to enhance 1,25D-mediated differentiation in other
AML cell lines such as OCI-AML3 (AML M4 subtype) and Monomac3 (AML M5 subtype; Fig. 1B). Besides assessing differentiation
using the NBT reduction assay, we have conﬁrmed AML differentiation by measuring the upregulation of CD14 and CD11b
surface expression, commonly used markers for AML differentiation (Fig. 1C–E). For example, CD11b expression in HL-60 cells
is 86% with the combination of 1,25D and GSK3 inhibition
whereas only 32% and 23% with 1,25D and GSK3 inhibition
alone, respectively. Although CD11b is upregulated during granulocytic differentiation, CD14 induction suggests these cells are
speciﬁcally undergoing monocytic differentiation.
Morphologic assessment of AML cells treated with the combination regimen demonstrates monocytic differentiation as can be
seen from increased cytoplasm and altered nuclear morphology
including nuclear indentation (Fig. 1F). In addition to AML cell
lines, GSK3 inhibition is also able to lead to evidence of differentiation in primary human AML cells (Fig. 1G). For example, 6 of
7 primary AML samples tested showed an enhancement of differentiation when 1,25D was combined with a GSK3 inhibitor. Of
note, the sample that did not exhibit a differentiation response to
the combination regimen also did not show any differentiation
response to 1,25D alone. Though much larger studies are necessary to deﬁne speciﬁc AML subtypes that would beneﬁt most from
this regimen, the samples tested are derived from AML patients
representing a variety of AML subtypes and genetic abnormalities
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Despite the heterogeneity in AML sam-

www.aacrjournals.org

ples, the majority of patients showed a response to the 1,25D and
GSK3 inhibitor regimen.
GSK3 inhibition enhances 1,25D-mediated growth inhibition
In addition to differentiation, the combination regimen leads
to an enhancement in AML growth inhibition over treatment with
either agent alone (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the observed growth
inhibition, the combination of 1,25D and GSK3 inhibition leads
to effects on the cell-cycle status of leukemic cells. For example,
though only modest effects are seen after a low dose of 1,25D or
GSK3 inhibition, the combination treatment leads to a decrease in
cells in the S-phase and a concomitant increase in cells in the
G0–G1 phase of the cell cycle (Table 1). For example, the combination leads to 68.0% of cells in the G0–G1 phase as compared
with 61.6% and 55.7% in the SB- and 1,25D-treated groups,
respectively. Consistent with the growth inhibition, the expression of the cell cycle–related protein cyclin A is downregulated
more by cotreatment of 1,25D and GSK3 inhibition as opposed to
single-agent treatment (Fig. 2B).
As the primary goal of AML differentiation therapy is to
permanently prevent the growth of AML cells, colony assays were
performed to test for irreversible growth arrest after limited
treatment. For this assay, AML cells were exposed to drug for 3
days, the drug was washed off and an equal number of viable cells
were plated in soft agar. A dramatic reduction in the number of
colonies formed was observed with the combination of 1,25D
and GSK3 inhibition as opposed to single-agent treatment in a
wide variety of AML cell lines (Fig. 2C and D). For example, in OCI
cells, the combination regimen led to only 9.3% of the number of
colonies of the vehicle-treated cells as compared with 72.9% and
95.3% in the SB- and 1,25D-treated samples, respectively. These
results support the combination regimen leads to signiﬁcant
irreversible growth arrest in viable cells.
GSK3 inhibition enhances 1,25D-mediated anticancer
activity in vivo
Besides cell-based studies, GSK3 inhibition also enhances the
ability of 1,25D to demonstrate efﬁcacy in a mouse model system
of circulating human AML (Fig. 2E). The primary human AML
cells used for this study are derived from a patient with relapsed,
treatment refractory non-APL leukemia. Although utilizing clinically achievable levels of either a GSK3 inhibitor (lithium) or
1,25D demonstrate some efﬁcacy, the combination regimen
led to prolonged survival. Of note, our mouse studies using
lithium demonstrated efﬁcacy with circulating lithium levels
(0.7 mmol/L; ref. 19) that are well within the normal therapeutic range of lithium for bipolar disease (0.6–1.2 mmol/L; ref.
20). This study further suggests that GSK3 inhibition using an
already FDA-approved agent is a promising strategy to achieve a
long held goal in AML therapy of enhancing the clinical activity of
1,25D in non-APL leukemia.

Genetic evidence of GSK3 in AML differentiation
Though we utilized well-established GSK3 inhibitors, we also
performed genetic experiments to validate the role of GSK3 in
AML differentiation to account for potential off-target effects.
Utilizing GSK3b knockdown cells, we observed the GSK3b-deﬁcient AML cells are sensitized to 1,25D-mediated differentiation
reinforcing that GSK3 does play an important role in 1,25Dmediated differentiation (Fig. 3A).
GSK3 modulates VDR activity
To elucidate how GSK3 is regulating 1,25D-mediated differentiation, we assessed whether GSK3 impacted the transcriptional activity of the 1,25D receptor (VDR) as GSK3 is a kinase
that is known to modulate the activity of several nuclear

receptors (21, 22). Although GSK3 inhibition with lithium or
SB did not lead to signiﬁcant effects on VDR transcriptional
activity, the combination of GSK3 inhibition and 1,25D led to a
marked increase in VDR transcriptional activity (Fig. 3B). In
addition to chemical GSK3 inhibitors, cells with stable knockdown of GSK3b, but not GSK3a, exhibited a higher level of
VDR transcriptional activity after 1,25D treatment as compared
with parental cells (Fig. 3C).
To further explore how GSK3 modulates VDR transcriptional
activity, we assessed whether GSK3 could directly bind to VDR
through coimmunoprecipitations or phosphorylate VDR through
in vitro kinase assays. We did not detect any direct interactions with
VDR or the ability of GSK3 to phosphorylate VDR (data not
shown). In addition, we assessed whether GSK3 impacted the

vector were transfected with VDRE-luc and assessed for luciferase activity after 72 hours. P values represent comparison of shGSK3 cells to parental controls.

GSK3 Regulates 1,25D-Mediated Differentiation

coimmunoprecipitation studies, the combination of 1,25D
and GSK3 inhibition was found to increase the association
of SRC3 with VDR providing a mechanistic insight into how
GSK3 enhances VDR activity (Fig. 4B–D).
As the association of VDR with its coregulators is often controlled by changes in phosphorylation of VDR, we explored
whether the combination of GSK3 inhibition and 1,25D could
lead to changes in the phosphorylation of VDR. Though low dose
1,25D and SB did not lead to signiﬁcant changes, we observed an
induction of serine phosphorylation of VDR upon combination
treatment (Fig. 4E). Though VDR is known to have multiple
phosphorylation sites, serine-208 is known to be a key site that
is phosphorylated that impacts VDR transcriptional activity, but
not DNA binding (23). Therefore, we tested speciﬁcally for
changes in serine-208 phosphorylation. The combination of
1,25D and GSK3 inhibition leads to induction of serine-208
phosphorylation on VDR providing further insight into how this
regimen enhances VDR activity and subsequent differentiation
(Fig. 4F).
Combining GSK3 inhibition and 1,25D leads to an enhanced
activation of JNK signaling
Consistent with our biologic ﬁndings, we identiﬁed downstream AML differentiation and growth inhibition pathways can
be signiﬁcantly modulated by the combination of 1,25D and
GSK3 inhibition. To investigate these pathways, we performed a
gene microarray study to look at early expression changes after
drug treatment. From this study, signiﬁcantly more genes were
modulated at least 1.5-fold in the combination group (179 genes)
as compared with 1,25D alone (67 genes) and GSK3 inhibition
alone (22 genes) after 24 hours of treatment (Fig. 5A). As
expected, the array revealed changes in expression of a number
of well-characterized genes involved in AML differentiation and
growth inhibition (e.g., CEBPB, CEBPE, MYC, CD11b, CD14, and
BTG1; Supplementary Fig. S4). The array also revealed a stronger
regulation of numerous well-established VDR target genes with
the combination regimen as opposed to single-agent treatment.
We validated the enhanced upregulation of several established
VDR target genes such as CYP24A, HBEGF, and FBP1 by real-time
PCR (Fig. 5B; ref. 24).
Pathway analysis was performed to elucidate signaling pathways that may be responsible for the enhanced differentiation in
the combination regimen. As expected, 1,25D alone led to the
activation of known 1,25D-dependent pathways such as ERK
(25). Interestingly, pathway analysis showed that the JNK signaling pathway was only signiﬁcantly activated by the combination
treatment and not low doses of either agent alone (Supplementary Fig. S5: as seen by JNK, MAPK8 activation, and SP600125
inhibition).
To assess the role of JNK in the differentiation response to GSK3
inhibition and 1,25D, we assessed for the activation of JNK as well
as the other MAPK proteins, p38 and MEK1/2 by Western analysis.
Consistent with the pathway analysis, we observed higher activation of JNK, but not p38 or MEK1/2, after combination treatment as opposed to single treatment using SB and 1,25D (Fig. 5C
and Supplementary Fig. SS6). To explore the impact of JNK
signaling on AML differentiation in response to GSK3 inhibition
and 1,25D, we impaired JNK activation in leukemia cells. After
JNK inhibition, the differentiation effects of the combination of
1,25D and GSK3 inhibition were impaired as measured using
both NBT reduction and CD14 induction, suggesting that JNK

plays an important role in this differentiation process (Fig. 5C). In
addition to JNK activation itself, we also observed a dramatic
increase in the phosphorylation of the JNK target protein c-jun in
the combination treated cells as opposed to leukemia cells treated
with the single agents (Fig. 5D).
Overall these studies reveal a model through which GSK3 can
modulate differentiation induced by 1,25D (Fig. 6). As GSK3 is a
constitutively active kinase, it suppresses VDR activity under basal
conditions, which limits the ability of 1,25D to induce differentiation. The suppression of VDR activity is due to a modulation of
its phosphorylation, which likely impacts its interaction with the
coactivator SRC3. Upon GSK3 inhibition, VDR phosphorylation
is induced and SRC3 is recruited allowing enhanced transcriptional activation and differentiation induction. As the combination regimen allows the use of low doses of 1,25D, the combination of GSK3 inhibition and 1,25D is a promising strategy for
future clinical testing.

Discussion
AML differentiation therapy can result in cells that are irreversibly growth arrested and eventually die without the necessity for
overt cytotoxicity. We and others have been actively searching for
novel differentiation therapies to attempt to improve the prognosis of AML patients (3, 26, 27). In this study, we identiﬁed a
novel therapeutic approach for AML differentiation and elucidated its mechanisms of action. We demonstrate that GSK3 is a
negative regulator of 1,25D-mediated AML differentiation. Inhibition of GSK3 through pharmacologic or genetic approaches was
found to signiﬁcantly enhance AML differentiation in a variety of
AML cell lines and patient samples. In addition, the combination
of 1,25D and GSK3 inhibition was found to enhance growth
inhibition and dramatically reduce the ability of AML cells to form
colonies in semisolid media. Finally, this combination regimen
showed promise in an animal model of circulating AML using
clinically achievable doses of lithium.
Mechanistic studies have provided signiﬁcant insights into how
GSK3 regulates 1,25D signaling. In particular, GSK3 inhibition
leads to an enhanced phosphorylation of VDR. Presently, it is not
clear how GSK3 inhibition leads to VDR phosphorylation but it is
likely due to GSK3-dependent regulation of an intermediate
kinases. Several kinases in addition to JNK have been shown to
modulate VDR phosphorylation. This enhanced VDR phosphorylation leads to the recruitment of the coactivator SRC-3 and

increases the transcriptional activity of VDR and differentiation
induction. Besides VDR transcriptional activity, pathway analysis
also revealed that activation of JNK signaling also plays a role in
the potentiation of 1,25D signaling by GSK3 inhibition. The role
of JNK signaling in AML differentiation in response to 1,25D
alone has been well established (28). However, this work illustrates the role of JNK in modulating the combination effects of
GSK3 inhibition and 1,25D.
Besides identifying a novel therapeutic strategy with clinical
potential, our study has revealed a novel role for GSK3 in 1,25D
receptor signaling. Interestingly, GSK3 is also known to function
as either a positive or negative regulator of other steroid/nuclear
receptors such as the estrogen, androgen, and retinoic acid receptors (4, 21, 22). It will be interesting to see whether GSK3
inhibition can enhance biologic effects of 1,25D signaling in
other contexts beyond leukemia.
GSK3 is also an interesting target as our studies as well as work
from others have demonstrated that a wide variety of AML cells
from diverse subtypes with different genetic abnormalities tend
all to be sensitive to GSK3 inhibition (5, 29–31). One major
advantage of targeting GSK3 is that GSK3 inhibition preferentially
inhibits the growth of AML, but not normal hematopoietic
progenitor cells. This activity is in stark contrast to the standard
AML chemotherapeutics that often lead to signiﬁcant bone marrow toxicities. Though further studies are necessary, it is known
that the dysregulation of GSK3 in AML (as well as other cancers) is
common and does not appear to depend on particular genetic
changes (5, 29–33). In addition, it has been reported that vitamin
D signaling is intact in AML across subtypes therefore providing a

speciﬁc strategy that may be more universal than many targeted
approaches (34).
In conclusion, we have identiﬁed that GSK3 is a novel regulator
of 1,25D signaling and that inhibition of GSK3 in combination
with 1,25D in AML is a promising strategy for clinical testing.
