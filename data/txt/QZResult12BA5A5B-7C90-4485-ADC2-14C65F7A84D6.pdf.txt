Abstract
The embryonic stem cell-like gene expression signature has
been shown to be associated with poorly differentiated
aggressive human tumors and has attracted great attention
as a potential target for future cancer therapies. Here, we
investigate the potential of the embryonic stem cell signature
as molecular target for the therapy and the strategy to
suppress the embryonic stem cell signature. The core stemness
gene Nanog is abnormally overexpressed in human embryonic
carcinoma NCCIT cells showing gene expression profiles
similar to embryonic stem cells. Down-regulation of the gene
by either small interfering RNAs targeting Nanog or histone
deacetylase inhibitor apicidin causes reversion of expression
pattern of embryonic stem cell signature including Oct4, Sox2,
and their target genes, leading to cell cycle arrest, inhibition of
colony formation in soft agar, and induction of differentiation
into all three germ layers. These effects are antagonized by
reintroduction of Nanog. Interestingly, embryonic carcinoma
cells (NCCIT, NTERA2, and P19) exhibit a higher sensitivity to
apicidin in down-regulation of Nanog compared with embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, the down-regulation of Nanog
expression by apicidin is mediated by a coordinated change in
recruitment of epigenetic modulators and transcription
factors to the promoter region. These findings indicate that
overexpression of stemness gene Nanog in NCCIT cells is
associated with maintaining stem cell-like phenotype and
suggest that targeting Nanog might be an approach for
improved therapy of poorly differentiated tumors. [Cancer
Res 2009;69(14):5716–25]

Introduction
Phenotypic and functional similarities between tumor cells and
normal stem cells have generated great interest in the possible
links between these classes of cells (1). Both tumor cells and
normal stem cells have extensive proliferative potential and
the ability to give rise to new tissues, although normal stem cells
do so in a highly regulated manner, whereas tumor cells self-renew
in a poorly regulated manner and differentiate abnormally.
Based on these similarities, it is hypothesized that tumors might

arise from normal stem or progenitor cells (2). However, it is
still possible that tumor cells can acquire stem cell-like characteristics through progressive dedifferentiation during their development. In addition, recent studies indicate that only a small
subpopulation of tumor cells are clonogenic and have the exclusive
ability to regenerate a tumor mass (3). These clonogenic cells have
been found in a wide array of highly undifferentiated tumors
including blood, brain, breast, and colon cancers with the
capability of both self-renewal and at least partial differentiation,
similar to that of normal stem cells (4). These characteristics of the
cells have led to their designation as cancer stem cells or tumorinitiating cells with stem cell-like properties. Although some
regulators of the stem cell function have been shown to be
implicated in tumorigenesis, a detailed characterization of the
activity of stem cell-associated regulatory networks in tumors is
still lacking.
The core stemness transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog,
which are expressed in embryonic stem cells and embryonic
carcinoma cells, are thought to be central to the transcriptional
regulatory network that specifies the identity of both cell types
(5, 6). Oct4, a member of POU class of homeodomain proteins, is
normally found in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst and is
required to maintain the pluripotency of the inner cell mass cells
(7). During differentiation, its expression is reduced through
mechanisms involving epigenetic modification. Mice lacking Oct4
exhibit early embryonic lethality due to a failure to form the inner
cell mass, indicating the critical role of Oct4 in controlling selfrenewal of embryonic stem cells. In contrast, overexpression of
Oct4 is directly linked to the tumorigenic potential of embryonic
stem cells (8). Nanog, another transcription factor, also plays a
critical role in regulating cell fate of the pluripotent inner cell mass
during embryonic development (9). In the absence of Nanog,
mouse embryonic stem cells differentiate into visceral/parietal
endoderm, whereas overexpression of Nanog can override the
requirement of leukemia inhibitory factor for self-renewal of
embryonic stem cells (10). Similarly, Nanog overexpression in
human embryonic stem cells enables maintenance of these cells in
the pluripotent state for a prolonged period, and knockdown of
Nanog promotes differentiation, indicating a role of Nanog in selfrenewal of human embryonic stem cells (11). Additionally, forced
expression of Nanog in hematopoietic stem cells followed by a
transplantation of these cells leads to development of a
lymphoproliferative disorder as well as gy T-cell malignancy (12).
Interestingly, Nanog and Oct4 are overexpressed in oral cancer
stem-like cells enriched through sphere formation by cultivating
oral squamous cell carcinoma cells (OSCC) from established OSCC
cell lines or primary culture of OSCC patients (13). Moreover, OSCC
patients positive to the expression of Nanog, Oct4, and CD133 have
been associated with the worst survival prognosis.

Down-regulation of Stemness Genes by HDACI

Recently, analysis of the expression patterns of gene sets
associated with the embryonic stem cell identity in various human
tumor types has identified a potential link between genes
associated with embryonic stem cell identity and the histopathologic traits of tumors (14). Stemness genes such as Nanog, Oct4,
Sox2, and c-Myc are normally enriched in embryonic stem cells,
and activation targets of these genes have been shown to be
overexpressed in histologically poorly differentiated tumors,
whereas these tumors repress preferentially polycomb-related
genes. This embryonic stem cell signature has been found in
several poorly differentiated cancers and often associated with a
poor clinical outcome. These observations suggest that stem celllike characteristics shown by many poorly differentiated tumors
might be attributed to abnormal activation of these genes.
Small molecules could offer several advantages that include the
ability for a temporal, tunable, and modular control of specific
proteins involved in various cellular processes without abnormal
genetic modification (15). Cell-based phenotypic assay and pathway
screening of synthetic small molecules and natural products have
historically provided useful chemical tools to modulate and/or
study complex cellular processes; thereby, some small molecules
such as dexamethasone and all-trans retinoic acid have been
identified as agents inducing stem cell differentiation. Moreover,
histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) and DNA demethylating
agents, which target abnormal epigenetic modifications, induce
differentiation of various transformed cells. However, the effects of
these small molecules are not fully evaluated in embryonic stem
cells or cancer stem cells. Therefore, the investigation of the
potential of embryonic stem cell signature as molecular target for
treatment of aggressive human tumors will provide a valuable
rationale to develop an effective strategy for future cancer therapy.
In this study, we report the first evidence that HDACI apicidin is
capable to down-regulate Nanog expression in poorly differentiated
human embryonic carcinoma cells, which is mediated by a
coordinated change in recruitment of epigenetic modulators
(DNMT3B, CBP, and EZH2) and transcription factors (SP1, GCNF,
Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2) to its promoter region. This downregulation of Nanog expression leads to decrease of other stemness
gene expression such as Oct4, Sox2, and their target genes and the
induction of differentiation markers for all three germ layers
including endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. Furthermore,
sensitivity to apicidin in suppression of Nanog expression is higher
in embryonic carcinoma cells than in embryonic stem cells. This
suggests that targeting the stemness gene Nanog may provide a
novel strategy for therapy of poorly differentiated tumors
associated with the embryonic stem cell signature.

Results
Differential expression of stemness genes in various human
cell lines. Poorly differentiated aggressive human tumors have
been shown to possess embryonic stem cell signature, which is
associated with poor prognosis (14). To examine the involvement of
the key regulators of embryonic stem cell signature in tumorigenesis, we have analyzed the expression level of the core stemness
genes in various human cell lines including embryonic stem H9,
embryonic carcinoma NCCIT, normal fibroblast BJ, cervical carcinoma
HeLa, breast cancer MCF7, ductal carcinoma HCC1954, osteocarcinoma U2OS, and lung carcinoma H1299 cells. Whereas Sox2 expression is detected in all cell lines tested with different levels, Oct4
and Nanog are expressed only in both embryonic stem H9 and
embryonic carcinoma NCCIT cells (Fig. 1A). However, the level of
Nanog expression is much higher in NCCIT than H9 cells, although
Oct4 is expressed with a comparable level in both cells, indicating the
dysregulation of Nanog expression in NCCIT cells.
Selective down-regulation of Nanog expression by HDACI
apicidin in embryonic carcinoma cells. To identify the
molecules that can suppress the abnormal Nanog expression in
NCCIT cells, these cells have been treated with small molecules,
which have been shown previously to regulate cell proliferation or
differentiation, such as all-trans retinoic acid, reversine, sonic
hedgehog signaling inhibitor (cyclopamine), mammalian target of
rapamycin inhibitor (rapamycin), clinical anticancer agents (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil), demethylating agent (5-aza-cytidine), and
HDACIs (apicidin, trichostatin A, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic
acid; ref. 17). Among the molecules tested, HDACIs (trichostatin A,
apicidin, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) have the most
significant effect on down-regulation of Nanog mRNA and protein
in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Among three HDACIs, we have further analyzed the effect of
apicidin on Nanog expression in embryonic stem and embryonic
carcinoma cells. Interestingly, apicidin treatment does not affect
Nanog mRNA expression in normal human embryonic stem cells,
whereas it causes a marked decrease in Nanog mRNA expression in
malignant human embryonic carcinoma cells (Fig. 1B). The effect
on Nanog protein expression is similar to that on Nanog mRNA
expression, except a slight increase in sensitivity of human
embryonic stem H9 cells to apicidin (Fig. 1B). Consistently,
expression levels of Nanog mRNA and protein show no alteration
in mouse embryonic stem J1 cells when treated with apicidin,

indicating that embryonic carcinoma cells are more sensitive to
apicidin treatment in inhibition of Nanog expression than
embryonic stem cells (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, down-regulation of
Nanog expression is accompanied by a decrease in Oct4 and Sox2
expression in both mouse and human embryonic carcinoma cells
(Fig. 1). In addition, apicidin treatment leads to down-regulation of
other stemness genes, such as FOXD3 and REX1 in NCCIT cells
(data not shown), and induces a time- and dose-dependent
decrease in Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 expression in NCCIT cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Among the stemness genes tested, Nanog
expression is most sensitive to apicidin treatment, suggesting that

Down-regulation of Stemness Genes by HDACI

down-regulation of Oct4 and Sox2 expression might be mediated
through down-regulation of Nanog. Consistent with these results, a
selective knockdown of Nanog expression by two independent
siRNA pools corresponding various regions of the Nanog transcript
leads to a significant decrease in the expression levels of mRNAs as
well as proteins of Oct4 and Sox2, whereas the control siRNA does
not affect expression of these genes (Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2) and an
irrelevant control gene (Supplementary Fig. S3). To further confirm
the effects, we have analyzed changes of Nanog expression in two
other poorly differentiated human cancer cell lines including
NTERA2 (embryonic carcinoma line) and PC3 (a prostate
adenocarcinoma cell line). Similarly, apicidin markedly decreases
both Nanog mRNA and protein levels in NTERA2 cells, which
express Nanog at high levels (Fig. 1D). However, the Nanog mRNA
and protein in PC3 are not detected (Fig. 1D). These results
indicate that apicidin down-regulates Nanog expression in Nanogpositive cancer cells.
Depletion of embryonic stem cell-like signature in NCCIT
cells by apicidin. To evaluate the full potential of HDACI apicidin
on transcriptional alterations in NCCIT cells, global gene expression
profiles were determined by an Illumina HumanRef-8 v2 Expression
BeadChips and compared between control and apicidin-treated
NCCIT cells. Two thousand twenty-five genes of a total of 23,920
arrayed genes are affected by apicidin treatment with >2-fold significant changes relative to control NCCIT cells (P < 0.05; dataset S1).
Among these genes, 1,030 genes are classified into the 13 gene sets
associated with the human embryonic stem cell identity, which are
classified previously by Ben-Porath and colleagues (ref. 14; dataset
S2). The various embryonic stem cell-expressed and Nanog, Oct4,
and Sox2 target gene sets are preferentially overexpressed in NCCIT
cells, whereas the polycomb target gene sets are underexpressed
(Fig. 2A). The apicidin treatment reverses enrichment patterns of all
gene sets, except Myc targets 2 (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S4).
Furthermore, the gene sets for Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 transcription
factors, embryonic stem cell expressions, Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2,
and Nanog targets are markedly affected by apicidin (Fig. 2A). These
findings indicate that the embryonic stem cell-like signature in
NCCIT cells, if not all, could be depleted by HDACI apicidin.
Induction of differentiation and apoptosis of NCCIT cells by
apicidin. To examine the effect of apicidin on induction of
differentiation of NCCIT cells, we have analyzed the expression of
various lineage-specific markers. The quantitative PCR (qPCR)
analysis of mRNA expression reveals that apicidin induces the
expression of the trophectoderm differentiation markers (CDX2
and CG), endoderm markers (GATA4, GATA6, AFP, FOXA2, SOX17,
and CK18), mesoderm markers (BRACHYURY, MSX1, NKX2.5,
NKX3.1, BMP4, HAND1, and MEF2C), and ectoderm markers
(MAP2, PAX6, HES4, and OLIG2; refs. 5, 18), ranging from f5- to
10-fold, compared with control (Fig. 2B), indicating the ability of
apicidin to enhance the differentiation potential of NCCIT cells to
the various lineages. To examine whether apicidin also affects cell
death of NCCIT cells, the effect of apicidin on apoptosis of NCCIT
cells has been analyzed by Annexin V staining using flow
cytometry. Apicidin treatment leads to a significant increase in
the number of Annexin V-positive cells (35.40%) compared with
control (1.60%; Fig. 2C). The similar effect on apoptosis by apicidin
treatment is also observed in NTERA2 and P19 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). To further examine the effect of apicidin on
anchorage-independent growth, we performed soft-agar colonyforming assay, which is considered the most stringent assay for
detecting malignant transformation of cells. Apicidin treatment

www.aacrjournals.org

dramatically abrogates colony formation of NCCIT cells in soft agar
(Fig. 2D). To further prove the role of Nanog in this model, we
performed a rescue experiment by overexpressing Nanog. Overexpression of Nanog antagonizes the effects of apicidin on cell
cycle arrest and differentiation (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Induction of antiproliferation and differentiation of NCCIT
cells by knockdown of Nanog. To further investigate the
relationship between the biological effects and the down-regulation
of Nanog by apicidin, we have selectively inhibited Nanog
expression using a siRNA targeting Nanog (Fig. 3A). The Nanogdepleted NCCIT cells show a prolonged doubling time as well as a
significant reduction in bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, compared with the control cells, from 31% to 19% (Fig. 3B and C). To
confirm the role of Nanog in cell growth, we rescued Nanog
expression by replating cells without further transfection of siRNA.
Suppression of cell growth by Nanog knockdown is recovered
similar to that of control cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition,
NCCIT cells transfected with Nanog siRNAs form 62.3% less
colonies than the control transfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The analysis of lineage-specific markers has revealed that the effect
of knockdown of Nanog on differentiation is similar to that
observed by apicidin treatment (Fig. 3D). However, the Nanog
knockdown has no significant effect on apoptosis (Supplementary
Fig. S3), whereas the proliferative potential is markedly impaired. In
addition, down-regulation of Nanog expression by apicidin
treatment appears not to be attributed to apoptosis, because a
low concentration of apicidin (0.1 Amol/L), which does not induce
apoptosis of NCCIT cells, suppresses the level of Nanog expression.
These results suggest that the effect of apicidin on induction of
differentiation and antitumorigenicity might be mediated by downregulation of Nanog but not the effect of apicidin on apoptosis.
Transcriptional inhibition of Nanog by apicidin. Apicidin has
been shown to induce cell cycle arrest at G0-G1 in HeLa cells (19).
To elucidate the relationship between apicidin-induced cell cycle
arrest and down-regulation of Nanog, we have analyzed the effect
of apicidin on cell cycle in NCCIT cells. In contrast to G0-G1 arrest
in HeLa cells, apicidin induces G2-M cell cycle arrest in NCCIT cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5). To examine the possibility that the cell
cycle arrest at G2-M may regulate down-regulation of Nanog, NCCIT
cells were arrested at G2-M by treatment with a pharmacologic
inhibitor nocodazole. As expected, the nocodazole treatment leads
to cell cycle arrest at G2-M, as seen by an increase in the number of
cells at G2-M up to 61% from 30% of control cells, comparable with
that induced by apicidin (Supplementary Fig. S5). However, the G2M arrest by nocodazole fails to down-regulate Nanog expression,
indicating that apicidin-induced down-regulation of Nanog expression might be independent of the apicidin-induced G2-M arrest
(Fig. 4A). In contrast to HDACI, DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine fails to induce neither cell cycle arrest nor down-regulation
of Nanog (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S5).
To further characterize the mechanisms by which apicidin
induces down-regulation of Nanog, we examined the recruitment
of RNA polymerase II to the regulatory elements of the Nanog gene.
The chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-polymerase II (8WG16) antibody shows that apicidin significantly
suppresses the transcriptional initiation, resulting in a decrease
in the transcriptional elongation as seen by a 65% and 68% decrease in recruitment of polymerase II into the transcription start
site and coding region of the gene, respectively (Fig. 4B and C).
These results suggest that apicidin might induce down-regulation
of Nanog expression mainly via inhibition of transcription.

However, down-regulation of Nanog expression by apicidin appears
to be attributed marginally to destabilization of Nanog protein,
because the decrease of in Nanog protein level by apicidin is only
slightly inhibited in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor MG132
(Supplementary Fig. S7).
Induction of repressive epigenetic modifications in the
promoter of Nanog by apicidin. To examine whether downregulation of Nanog by apicidin is associated with alterations of
epigenetic modification on the promoter, we have first analyzed
the status of DNA methylation, a repressive epigenetic marker.
Bisulfite mapping reveals that methylation of four CpG sites

located f300 bp upstream of transcription start site (20) is
affected by apicidin treatment. Unmethylated four CpG sites in the
region undergo methylation following apicidin treatment (>30%;
Fig. 4D). We have then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis to test a possible involvement of histone modifications in
transcriptional suppression of Nanog by apicidin. Apicidin
treatment leads to the significant hypoacetylation of histone H3
and H4 on the region from transcription start site up to f1,000 bp
upstream harboring putative binding sites for transcription factors
such as p53, SP1, Oct4, and Sox2. In addition, active marker K4

region of the Nanog gene is depleted following apicidin treatment, whereas the repressive marker K27 trimethylation of H3 is
enriched on these sites. Consistent with the results, apicidin
induces the recruitment of DNMT3B and EZH2 into the promoter while decreasing the recruitment of CBP (Fig. 4E). Chromatin immunoprecipitation data have further been confirmed
by qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S8). Taken together, the results
indicate that the transcriptional repression of Nanog by apicidin
might be attributed to repressive epigenetic modifications (21)
through alteration of the recruitment of epigenetic enzymes on
the promoter.
Altered recruitments of transcription factors into the Nanog
promoter by apicidin. Nanog gene is regulated by a complex

www.aacrjournals.org

interplay of both positive and negative cis-regulatory elements that
are distributed over a large area of 5¶ flanking region of the Nanog
gene (22). Thus, we have analyzed the recruitment of negative/
positive regulators into the promoter containing putative binding
sites for transcription factors. On apicidin treatment, the Nanog,
Oct4, Sox2, and SP1 are depleted at those sites (Fig. 5A). The
decrease of the recruitment of Oct4 and Sox2 seems to be due to
decreased protein levels of these genes as well as reduction of the
binding affinity of these proteins to Nanog promoter, because
apicidin (0.1 Amol/L), which suppresses the expression of Nanog
without altering expression of Oct4 and Sox2, is able to block the
recruitment of Oct4 and Sox2 to the Nanog promoter (Supplementary Fig. S9). In antiparallel, GCNF, a negative regulator (23), is

recruited into the region (b) (Fig. 5A). These data from chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis have been confirmed by the qPCR
analysis (Supplementary Fig. S8). To further study the function of
SP1 in apicidin-mediated down-regulation of Nanog expression, we
have examined the effect of inhibitor of SP1 by the treatment of
mithramycin, inhibitor of SP1 binding (24), or knockdown of SP1 by
a SP1-specific siRNA on the Nanog expression. SP1 suppression by
either mithramycin or siRNA ablates the expression of Nanog
mRNA and protein (Fig. 5B and C).

Discussion
This study provides evidence that core stemness transcription factors Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 could be targeted by HDACI

for future therapy of poorly differentiated human tumors
associated with embryonic stem cell signature. Treatment of embryonic carcinoma NCCIT cells with HDACI apicidin suppresses
the expression of the stemness genes, Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4,
of which Nanog is most sensitive to apicidin. The selective
down-regulation of Nanog by siRNAs leads to a concomitant
decrease in the levels of Oct4 and Sox2. Down-regulation of
Nanog expression by apicidin is associated with transcriptional
inhibition through induction of repressive epigenetic modifications in the promoter including DNA methylation, hypoacetylation of H3/H4, enrichment of K27 trimethylation, and depletion
of K4 trimethylation of H3. Induction of the repressive epigenetic
modification correlates well with coordinated changes of recruitment of epigenetic and transcriptional regulators. Furthermore,

Down-regulation of Stemness Genes by HDACI

Figure 5. Effect of apicidin on the recruitment of
transcription factors into the Nanog promoter. A, changes
in the recruitment of Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, GCNF, and SP1
into the promoter regions of Nanog following apicidin
treatment (1 Amol/L, 24 h) were determined by chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis in NCCIT cells. B, after
pretreatment with 200 nmol/L mithramycin (MTM ) for 1 h,
NCCIT cells were incubated with 1 Amol/L apicidin for an
additional 24 h. The level of Nanog was determined by
qPCR and Western blot. C, transfection of NCCIT cells
with SP1 targeted and control siRNA was carried out using
Lipofectamine 2000. At 48 h post-transfection, the
expression of SP1 and Nanog was analyzed by qPCR and
Western blot. Representative of three independent
experiments with similar results.

suppression of Nanog either by apicidin or siRNA enhances the
potentials for antiproliferation, differentiation, and antitumorigenicity of NCCIT cells. These results indicate that HDACI can be
efficiently used to treat aggressive human tumors with embryonic
stem cell signature.
Embryonic carcinoma cells provide a good model system of
the stem cell concept of cancer, because they are the stem cells
derived from a teratocarcinoma, and the malignant counterparts
of embryonic stem cells, capable of self-renewal as well as
differentiation into a wide range of cell types, similar to embryonic
stem cells (25, 26). In addition, embryonic carcinoma cells show
profiles of gene expression very similar to those of human
embryonic stem cells (6). In particular, the core transcriptional
regulatory circuitry consisting of Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 is retained
active in embryonic carcinoma cells, indicating that the core
stemness genes might be good molecular targets to treat
poorly differentiated human tumors (1, 8, 13, 14, 27). Among them,
Nanog gene has also been shown to be located on human

www.aacrjournals.org

chromosome 12p13, a region frequently duplicated on human
tumors of germ cell origin including embryonic carcinoma
cells and human embryonic stem cells cultured for a long period
(6, 28). Indeed, Nanog is overexpressed much higher than other
stemness genes, Oct4 and Sox2, and most sensitive to HDACI
in NCCIT cells (Fig. 1). Furthermore, HDACI suppression of
Nanog expression precedes decrease of Oct4 and Sox2, and the
specific knockdown of Nanog by siRNAs induces the downregulation of Oct4 and Sox2 expression (Figs. 1 and 3; Supplementary Information). These results suggest that Nanog abnormally
overexpressed in NCCIT cells may act as a master transcription
regulator that entrains the hierarchy of gene expression controlling
pluripotency. In contrast to our findings, it has been reported
previously that Nanog knockdown in NCCIT cells had no effect
on expression levels of Oct4 and Sox2 (29). This discrepancy
might be due in part to the incomplete knockdown of Nanog
in the previous study, because complete knockdown of Nanog
by transfecting a combination of the siRNA pool from previous

study and a second siRNA pool corresponding to different regions
of the Nanog transcript leads to concomitant suppression of
Oct4 and Sox2 (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S3). Importantly,
apicidin-induced suppression of the key regulators (Nanog,
Oct4, and Sox2) is accompanied by reversion of the enrichment
patterns of 13 gene sets associated with embryonic stem cell
identity and by induction of cell cycle arrest at G2-M and expression of differentiation markers for all three germ layers, suggesting that the depletion of embryonic stem cell signature in NCCIT
cells might be sufficient for inhibition of proliferation, leading
to differentiation.
The epigenetic regulation of stemness genes is critical for
maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency of stem cells (30, 31).
Thus, abnormal expression of Nanog in NCCIT cells might be
attributed to dysregulation of epigenetic control in addition
to genetic aberration. In fact, the Nanog promoter is marked by
active epigenetic modifications, which is reversed by apicidin
treatment; apicidin induces DNA methylation of four CpG sites in
association with repressive histone modifications, K27 trimethylation, depletion of K4 trimethylation of H3, and hypoacetylation
of H3/H4 (Fig. 4). In parallel, CBP is dissociated from the promoter,
whereas both EZH2 and DNMT3B are recruited to the region
(c) proximal to the transcription start site (Fig. 4). EZH2 has been
shown to control CpG methylation through a direct physical
contact with DNMTs (32). Thus, the recruitment of EZH2 and
DNMT3B to the promoter might be medicated by protein-protein
interaction between EZH2 and DNMT3B, resulting in generation
of pivotal repressive markers, methylation of four CpG sites, and
K27 trimethylation. The levels and recruitment of other epigenetic
modifiers such as HDACs, P/CAF, and DNMT1 into the promoter
are minimally affected by apicidin (data not shown). Changes of
chromatin structure by epigenetic modifications are associated
with alteration of accessibility of transcription factors to the
promoter (33). Alteration of epigenetic modifications on the Nanog
promoter by apicidin is accompanied by decrease in the
recruitment of positive transcription regulators (Nanog, Oct4,
Sox2, and SP1) and increase in the recruitment of negative
regulator GCNF (Fig. 5). The decrease of the recruitment of Nanog,
Oct4, and Sox2 seems to be attributed to regulatory circuitry
consisting of autoregulatory and feed-forward loops between them
as shown previously (5). However, in addition to the regulatory
circuitry, other unknown mechanism independent of Nanog
appears to be involved in down-regulation of Oct4 and Sox2
by apicidin, because 0.1 Amol/L apicidin (Supplementary Fig. S2)
can suppress only Nanog expression without alterations in
Oct4 and Sox2 expression, whereas down-regulation of Nanog by
Nanog siRNAs and 1 Amol/L apicidin (Figs. 1 and 3A) is
accompanied with suppression of Oct4 and Sox2. Recent studies
have shown that, on treatment of mouse embryonic stem cells with
retinoic acid, induction of GCNF and p53 suppresses the expression
of Nanog via direct binding to the promoter, resulting in
differentiation (22, 23, 34). Consistent with these observations, we
show that GCNF is recruited to the promoter region harboring
putative binding sites for transcription factor GCNF by apicidin,
which is accompanied by differentiation. In contrast, the
recruitment of another negative regulator p53 is not detected
(data not shown). This appears to be due to expression of
truncated p53 by a frameshift mutation in NCCIT cells, because p53
recruitment to the Nanog promoter is detected in normal p53expressing mouse embryonic carcinoma P19 cells (data not
shown). Recently, mSin3A/HDAC complex has been shown to play

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

a positive role in Nanog and Sox2 promoters in mouse embryonic
carcinoma P19 cells (35). However, we could not detect significant
changes in the recruitment of mSin3A in NCCIT cells by apicidin
treatment, although we observed a positive role of mSin3A in
Nanog promoter in P19 cells as reported previously (Supplementary Fig. S8). Forced expression of Oct4 and Sox2 in differentiated
cells fails to rescue Nanog promoter activity, indicating that some
other transcription factors may be required for induction of Nanog
gene expression. Furthermore, SP1 binding sites have recently been
mapped on the Nanog gene promoter in mouse embryonic
carcinoma cells (36). In agreement with this notion, SP1 is enriched
at the promoter containing GC-rich elements in NCCIT cells but
depleted in the presence of apicidin. This is further evidenced by
the observation that SP1 knockdown by either mithramycin or
siRNA also ablates the expression of Nanog (Fig. 5). Because it has
been shown that SP1 is able to form a coactivator complex with
p300/CBP, the decrease of SP1 recruitment by apicidin might lead
to concomitant dissociation of CBP from the promoter, thereby
hypoacetylation of histone H3 and H4 (37). Overexpression of CBP
causes a slight enhancement of Nanog expression in the absence of
apicidin but does not restore down-regulation of Nanog by apicidin
(Supplementary Fig. S8). These results indicate that a change of the
SP1affinity to the promoter rather than the level of CBP protein is
more crucial for down-regulation of Nanog by apicidin. However, it
appears that SP1 alone is not sufficient, because Nanog is not
detected in other cancer cells expressing SP1 (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Understanding the embryonic stem cell signature in poorly differentiated human tumors will be helpful in eradicating tumors
more efficiently. One promising approach is to target the core
stemness transcription factors, Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2, which are
well known for playing important roles in self-renewal and
pluripotency of stem cells. Our study shows that Nanog abnormally overexpressed by epigenetic and transcriptional dysregulation may contribute to cancer characteristics of poorly
differentiated aggressive tumors and provides insights into the
mechanism of Nanog transcriptional regulation in embryonic
carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the observation that HDACI is able
to deplete Nanog with concomitant suppression of Oct4 and Sox2
suggests that development of specific drugs that target abnormal
patterns of epigenetic modification may be not only an attractive
strategy to modulate gene expression patterns, which confer
unique properties in cancer cells defined as stemness, but also a
useful pharmacologic tool for studying the fundamental biology
of stem cells, which is now emerging as an important and exciting field.
