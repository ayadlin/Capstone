ABSTRACT
B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a malignant disorder characterized by
the abnormal proliferation of B-cell progenitors. Philadelphia chromosome-positive
(Ph+) B-ALL is a subtype that expresses the Bcr-Abl fusion protein which represents
a negative prognostic factor. Constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) network is a
common feature of B-ALL, influencing cell growth and survival. In the present study,
we aimed to investigate the efficacy of PI3K isoform inhibition in B-ALL cell lines
harboring the Bcr-Abl fusion protein.
We studied the effects of anti Bcr-Abl drugs Imatinib, Nilotinib and GZD824
associated with PI3K isoform inhibitors. We used a panel of six compounds which
specifically target PI3K isoforms including the pan-PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474, p110α
BYL719 inhibitor and the dual p110γ/p110δ inhibitor IPI145. The effects of single
drugs and of several drug combinations were analyzed to assess cytotoxicity by MTS
assays, apoptosis and autophagy by flow cytometry and Western blot, as well as the
phosphorylation status of the pathway.
ZSTK474, BYL719 and IPI145 administered in combination with imatinib, nilotinib
and GZD824 for 48 h, decreased cell viability, induced apoptosis and autophagy in a
marked synergistic manner.
These findings suggest that selected PI3K isoform inhibitors used in combination
with anti Bcr-Abl drugs may be an attractive novel therapeutic intervention in Ph+ B-ALL.

INTRODUCTION

gene Bcr-Abl lead to an aberrant cell proliferation [1].
Bcr-Abl is the most common cytogenetic abnormality and
the most unfavourable prognostic factor in adult acute
lymphoblastic leukemia patients (ALL) [2], where 20–30%
of them express the Bcr-Abl oncogene [3, 4].
The selective Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor
Imatinib deeply changed the pharmacological treatment

The over-production of immature white blood cells is a
relevant feature of ALL, a heterogeneous disease characterized
by multiple, prognostically relevant genetic aberrations.

of another form of Ph+ cancer, i.e. chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML), by inducing long lasting remissions [5].
Unfortunately, Imatinib showed much less efficiency in
treating Ph+ ALL and although unrelated to the Bcr-Abl
kinase domain alterations, the underlying mechanisms
are largely unknown [1]. The second generation tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) Nilotinib shows both a stronger
potency than Imatinib and also acts against most Imatinibunresponsive Bcr-Abl mutation variants [6–8]. A new,
third generation orally bioavailable Bcr-Abl inhibitor,
GZD824, has been recently developed, with potency
against a wide range of Bcr-Abl mutants [9]. In general,
Ph+ B-ALL is less sensitive to TKIs that CML. Therefore,
novel drugs are needed to improve response rates and to
circumvent TKI-resistance in Ph+ B-ALL [10].
Class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks)
comprises members of a conserved family of heterodimeric
intracellular lipid kinases capable to activate Akt which
in turn phosphorylates target proteins thus affecting cell
growth, cell cycle progression, and cell survival [11, 12].
Class IA PI3Ks comprises a catalytic subunit
(p110α, p110β, p110γ, p110δ) and a tightly bound
regulatory subunit (p85α, p55α, p50α, p85β, or p55γ).
The regulatory subunits maintain the integrity of the
catalytic one and direct the heterodimer to membraneassociated signaling complexes [13]. The activation of
the PI3K network is regulated by the 3’-phosphate lipid
phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog
deleted on chromosome 10) and loss of activity of this
tumor suppressor gene induces an increased downstream
activation [14–16]. Alterations in PTEN have been
reported in several tumors, most notably endometrial,
central nervous system, skin and prostate cancers [17].
Due to the crucial role of PI3Ks in regulating cell
cycle, metabolism, and survival, the PI3K signaling
cascade in human leukemias is one of the most often
altered pathways [18, 19] and different compounds
targeting members of the PI3K network have been
developed and entered clinical trials [20]. Currently
several PI3K inhibitors are under development: ZSTK474,
a specific pan-PI3K inhibitor [21, 22], displays potent antitumor efficacy on various solid tumors [23, 24]. PIK3CA,
the gene which encodes for p110α PI3K, is mutated in a
variety of tumor types [25–27] and BYL719 is a specific
class-IA PI3K inhibitor, which acts by binding the ATPbinding domain of the p110α subunit [28]. BYL719 has
recently been reported to have significant activity against
tumors carrying mutations in the p110α subunit of PI3K
[29, 30].
Pharmacological blockade of both p110γ and p110δ
reduced T-ALL proliferation and survival, indicating these
isoforms as therapeutic targets for T-ALL treatment [31].
AS605240 has been previously described as an isoformselective ATP-competitive inhibitor of PI3Kγ [32] while
CAL-101 is an oral p110δ inhibitor currently under clinical
evaluation in patients with B-cell malignancies [33].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The  selective, oral p110δ and p110γ subunits inhibitor,
IPI145, is reported to be in phase I study [34]. TGX221, is
a p110β-selective inhibitor [35].
Aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a
panel of PI3K isoform inhibitors in Ph+ B-ALL cell lines
by combining their anti-tumor activity with anti Bcr-Abl
drugs. We decided to specifically target p110α, p110β,
p110γ and p110δ PI3K catalytic subunits, along with dual
p110γ/p110δ and pan-PI3K inhibitors, and we evaluated
their effects on leukemic cell proliferation and survival.
Our results demonstrated that the pan PI3K isoform
inhibitor ZSTK474, the p110α inhibitor BYL719 and
the IPI145 dual p110γ/p110δ inhibitor exerted the most
powerful effects in all the Ph+ B-ALL cell lines tested
and their combined use with TKIs enhanced the treatment
efficacy. Our findings support the concept that clinical
trials examining PI3K inhibitors in combination with TKIs
are warranted in patients with Ph+ B-ALL.

RESULTS
PI3K inhibitors affect cell viability of Ph+ B-ALL
cell lines
In order to establish the role of the different PI3K
catalytic subunits in sustaining leukemic cells proliferation
and survival, we investigated by Western blot analysis the
baseline expression of Bcr-Abl and its substrate CrkL,
the PI3K catalytic subunits and the key enzymes of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR network in three B-ALL cell lines
(TOM-1, BV-173 and SUP-B15). As shown in Figure 1,
Bcr-Abl and CrkL, the p110α, -β, -γ, -δ, PI3K catalytic
subunits and the downstream PI3K substrate Akt and the
pathway negative regulator PTEN were expressed and/or
phosphorylated in all cell lines.
For the inhibition of p110α, p110β, p110γ and p110δ,
we employed ZSTK474, BYL719, TGX221, CAL101
and AS605240, whose selectivity has been reported
[36]. Because of the prominent role of p110δ and p110γ
isoforms in white blood cells, effects of the γ/δ dual
inhibitor IPI145, as well as of a combination consisting of
CAL101 and AS605240, were also evaluated. Cell lines
were cultured with increasing concentrations of the drugs
for 48 h followed by metabolic activity assessment by MTS
assay (Figure 2A). In all cell lines, cell viability decreased
after treatment with ZSTK474 with IC50 values close to
0.5 µM. Selective inhibition of p110α, p110β, p110γ and
p110δ isoforms had less efficacy, and IC50 values were
not attained up to a 10 µM concentration. Longer time
points (72 h) did not further affect the metabolic activity of
inhibitor-treated cell lines (data not shown).
We decided to focus our study on ZSTK474 and
γ/δ dual inhibitor IPI145 as well as on the p110α inhibitor
BYL719, whose role in this type of leukemia has not been
thoroughly investigated yet [30, 37, 38].

The PI3K/Akt/mTOR network, its expression and
modulation status of key components were assessed to
evaluate the efficacy of these inhibitors. Cells were treated
with 0.25 µM ZSTK474, 2.5 µM BYL719 or IPI145 and
Western blot analysis was performed. These concentrations
were chosen as they produced the maximal effects on
protein dephosphorylation at the lowest dose. All the PI3K
isoform inhibitors decreased the phosphorylation level
of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis key substrates Akt and S6
ribosomal protein (Figure 2B).

Western blot in TOM-1, BV-173 and SUP-B15 cell lines
after 24 h (Figure 3A). LC3A/B II expression increased
with ZSTK474 pan-inhibitor treatment in all cell lines and
to a lower extent with BYL719 and IPI145, indicating the
induction of autophagy.
To analyze whether the reduced viability was
apoptosis-related, cell lines were treated with the inhibitors
for 24 h at the same doses used to detect autophagy.
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in
TOM-1, BV-173 and SUP-B15 cells demonstrated the
pro-apoptotic effect induced by the PI3K inhibitors.
As demonstrated for the autophagy marker LC3A/B,
the expression levels of cleaved PARP increased when
cell lines were treated with ZSTK474 pan-inhibitor, or
the p110α-selective inhibitor BYL719 and to a lower
extent with IPI145 (Figure 3A). The role of autophagy
was further investigated using the lysosomal inhibitor
chloroquine at 1 µM. In all cases, chloroquine increased
the cytotoxic effects of the PI3K inhibitors, suggesting
that autophagy is a protective mechanism against these
drugs (Figure 3B). Moreover, caspase 3/7 activation was
quantified by measuring the enzymatic cleavage of the

Autophagy and apoptosis are induced by PI3K
inhibitors in B-ALL cell lines
Autophagic process is an evolutionarily mechanism
involved in the degradation of cellular components and
is crucial for the maintenance of cell homeostasis [39].
Altered autophagy is related with cancer and has been
implicated in the disease development and survival
[40–42]. To assess whether the administration of PI3K
inhibitors could induce autophagy, we analyzed LC3A/B
I (non lipidated) and LC3A/B II (lipidated) levels by

greatest potency, with IC50 values ranging from 0.03 µM in
BV-173 to 0.2 µM in TOM-1 cells (Figure 4 and Table 1).

Bcr-Abl inhibitors decreased cell viability in Ph+
B-ALL cell lines

Requirement for CrkL kinase activity has been
demonstrated in a recent report with Bcr-Abl transformation
and oncogenic signal transduction [43]. As shown in Figure
5A, cells were exposed for 48 h to Imatinib, Nilotinib or
GZD824, and lysates were analyzed by Western blot with
an antibody directed to the phosphorylated forms of CrkL
and S6 ribosomal protein. All anti Bcr-Abl drugs decreased
the levels of phosphorylated CrkL with little or no effects
on S6 ribosomal protein. In contrast, cell treatment with
0.25 µM ZSTK474 or 2.5 µM BYL719 or IPI145 for 48 h

Akt/mTOR signaling pathway substrates

We examined by MTS assay the IC50 value of
each Bcr-Abl inhibitor in the three cell lines. After 48 h
of drug administration, the cells showed different drug
sensitivity. Imatinib attained an IC50 of 1.1 µM in BV-173
cells whereas in TOM-1 and SUP-B15 cell lines IC50 was
not attained up to a concentration of 20 µM and 10 µM,
respectively. Nilotinib IC50 ranged from 0.1 µM in BV-173

did not affect the phosphorylation levels of pCrkL, while
the expression of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein was
abolished (Figure 5B).

MTS assays were performed in SUP-B15 cells treated with
the different drugs administered together for 48 h. As shown
in Figure 6, SUP-B15 were responsive and showed a good,
synergistic cytotoxicity as demonstrated by the CIs.
As representative of the combined treatments,
MTS assays on TOM-1 and BV-173 cell lines were also
performed with ZSTK474/Imatinib,BYL719/Nilotinibor
IPI145/GZD824. As expected, the combination of the drugs
resulted in a potent synergism also at low concentrations of
each inhibitor in these cell lines (Figure 7A and 7B).

PI3K isoforms inhibition combined with anti
Bcr-Abl drugs induced increased autophagy in
Ph+ B-ALL cells

The apoptotic effects of the single and combined
drug administration compared to the control in the
three cell lines was then evaluated (Figure 8A–8C).
The analysis was performed by Annexin-V-FITC
staining and PI in flow cytometry after 24 h of drug
treatments. The drug concentrations used were 0.25 μM
for ZSTK474 and GZD824, and 2.5 μM for the other
inhibitors.
The combined administration of the PI3K inhibitors
with anti Bcr-Abl drugs showed a significant increase in
the percentage of apoptotic cells.

To better quantify autophagy, the detection of
LC3A/B was performed in all cell lines by flow cytometry.
After a 24 h incubation, a statistically relevant increase
in autophagy was induced by combined treatment of
TKIs and PI3K inhibitors when compared to single
administrations (Figure 9A–9C).

DISCUSSION
It has been reported that targeted cancer
therapy could be more effective and less harmful than

conventional chemotherapy [44]. PI3K plays a key
role in regulating cell cycle, survival and metabolism,
and the PI3K signaling cascade is a very frequently
altered axis in human tumors [45]. Different compounds
targeting members of the PI3K have been synthesized
and are now in clinical trials [36]. Better understanding
of the PI3K pathway modulation have led to a rational
development and utilization of PI3K inhibitors in patients
with leukemias. The pan-PI3K ZSTK474 inhibitor and
the dual γ/δ IPI145 inhibitor are undergoing analysis
and are already demonstrating increasing preclinical and
clinical results [23, 46]. For example, ZSTK474 inhibitor
displayed a potent anticancer activity in human tumor
xenografts [47] while BYL719 has shown synergistic
antineoplastic efficacy when used in endocrine cure
against ER+/PIK3CA mutated breast tumor cells [48].
In Ph+ B-ALL cells, relapses are very frequent,
especially in adults, with a very poor prognosis,
highlighting the need for new therapeutic strategies [49].
Moreover, PI3K network has been strongly involved either
in malignant transformation and in the development of
TKI-resistance in Ph+ B-ALL [50].

We explored the therapeutic potential of the PI3K
pan-inhibitor ZSTK474, the p110α inhibitor BYL719
and dual γ/δ inhibitor IPI145 in a set of Ph+ B-ALL
cells. It is worth noting that these cell lines showed
an hyperphosphorylation of PTEN, that results in its
inactivation and hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling network [51].
We reported that ZSTK474 reduced cell viability
and caused both autophagy and apoptosis in Ph+ B-ALL
cells. ZSTK474, when administered in the micromolar
range, synergized in all cell lines with either Imatinib,
Nilotinib or GZD824. In this study, we analyzed for the
first time the efficacy of PI3K isoform-selective inhibitors
in Ph+ B-ALL. BYL719 and IPI145 were cytotoxic
in the micromolar range to Ph+ B-ALL cell lines, as
shown by MTS and Annexin V-stained samples analysis.
However, ZSTK474 was more cytotoxic than BYL719
and IPI145, as it displayed an IC50 value of 0.5 μM. The
phosphorylation level of the key components of the PI3K/
Akt/mTOR axis, analyzed by Western blot, showed the
same sensitivity to ZSTK474 inhibition in all cell lines.
It should be highlighted that another recent study has

demonstrated the efficacy of the pan-PI3K inhibitor,
NVP-BKM120, in pre-clinical models of Ph+ B-ALL [52].
Interestingly, this inhibitor displayed an IC50 of 0.5 µM
which is the same as that of ZSTK474.
However, it should be considered that NVPBKM120 displays considerable off-target effects [53]
which so far have not been reported for ZSTK474.
It is also important to emphasize that a previous
study from our group has documented how ZSTK474 was
not cytotoxic to healthy T-cells [54].
A greater efficacy was also evident in case of
GZD824, a third generation anti Bcr-Abl drug, which
showed an increased anti-leukemic activity in comparison
to first and second generation inhibitors in Ph+ B-ALL cells.
When cell lines were treated with anti Bcr-Abl
drugs the phosphorylated form of CrkL protein was
abolished, whereas the phosphorylated S6 ribosomal
protein was minimally affected. Interestingly, these
findings are in agreement with those of others who
documented in their study that Akt activity was
surprisingly not inhibited by Imatinib administration of
primary CML-cells [55].
This demonstrated the specificity of these
inhibitors against the Bcr-Abl fusion protein. In
contrast, cell samples treated with selected PI3K isoform
inhibitors showed an unchanged expression level of

phosphorylated CrkL protein and a strong decrease in
the phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein.
Overall, the PI3K isoform inhibitors used in this
study displayed increased potency when combined with
anti Bcr-Abl drugs in terms of cell viability reduction as
well as, apoptosis and autophagy induction. Future studies
should address the issue of how these drug combinations
increase apoptosis and autophagy.
In conclusion, our data show that investigational PI3K
inhibitors can block the growth of Ph+ B-ALL cell lines but
are likely to be most effective when used in combination
with Bcr-Abl inhibitors and provide an important preclinical
rationale for future clinical applications.

(Milan, Italy). Annexin V/7-ADD detection kit was from
Merck-Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany). Western blot
antibodies for total Akt-1, Ser473 p-Akt-1 and Thr308
p-Akt-1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA), while all the other antibodies were from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA), including
the rabbit secondary antibody. Chloroquine, the mouse
secondary antibody and the monoclonal β-Actin antibody
were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Milan, Italy). Signals
were detected using ECL Plus reagent from Perkin Elmer
(Boston, MA, USA).

(Merck Millipore, Milan, Italy) in according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, a 100 µl treated
cell suspension was labeled for 20 min in the dark with
the same volume of the MuseTM Annexin-V & Dead Cell
reagent (Merck Millipore). Subsequently, quantitative
detection of Annexin-V/7-AAD positive cells was
performed using the Muse™ Cell Analyzer.

Autophagy analysis and detection of endogenous
LC3
Autophagy analysis was performed using the Muse™
Cell Analyzer (Merck Millipore, Milan, Italy). In brief,
8 × 104 cells were plated in 96 well plates and treated with
the different drugs for 24 h. Then, cells were harvested,
treated with Autophagy Reagent A for 2–6 h, washed
with Assay Buffer, incubated for 30 minutes in the dark
with Anti-LC3 Alexa Fluor®555 Antibody and acquired
by Muse. Samples were then analyzed according to the
instrument protocol.

Cell cultures
The SUP-B15 Ph+ B-ALL cell line was obtained
from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und
Zellkulturen GmbH (Braunschweig, Germany). BV173 and TOM-1 Ph+ B acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(B-ALL) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Fabrizio
Pane’s laboratory at University of Naples, Italy. BV-173
and TOM-1 were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin at a density of 0.5 to 2 × 106 cells/ml and
were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2.
SUP-B15 was maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium
supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin at a density of 0.5 to 2 × 106 cells/ml and
were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Caspase 3/7 activity assay
Caspase activity was measured with the ApoOne Homogeneous Caspase 3/7 assay kit (Promega
Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The induction of apoptosis
and associated activation of caspases 3 and 7 were
measured by enzymatic cleavage of the profluorescent
substrate rhodamine 110, bis-N-CBZ-L-aspartyl-LglutamlL-valyl-L-aspartic acid amide (Z-DEVD-R110), which
releases the intensely fluorescent rhodamine 110-cleaving
group. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105/ml and
incubated in a 96-well plate in the presence or absence of
drug for 48 h. 100 μl of the homogeneous caspase-3/-7
reagent was added to each well and the reaction mixture
was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Fluorescence
was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and
an emission wavelength of 538 nm. Results are expressed
as relative fluorescence units (RFU), as previously
described [54].

Western blot
The cells were homogenized for 30 min in cold
lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA pH
8.0, 10 mM MgCl2 , 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 20
mM β-glicerophosphate, 0.5% NP40, 0.1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT and protease
inhibitor cocktail, Roche Applied Science Basel,
Switzerland). Lysate was purified by centrifugation for
10 min at 4°C and 20–50 μg of solubilized proteins were
resolved on 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE [56].

Combined drug effect analysis

Cell viability analysis

The effects and the potential synergy of drug
combinations were evaluated from quantitative analysis
of dose-effect relationship, as described previously [58].
For each experiment, a combination index (CI)
number was calculated using the Biosoft CalcuSyn
software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). This method of
analysis generally defines CI values from 0.9 to 1.1 as
additive, from 0.3 to 0.9 as synergistic and below 0.3
as strongly synergistic, whereas values over 1.1 are
considered as antagonistic.

MTS (3-[4,5-Dimethylthythiazol-2-yl]-5-(3-carboxy
methoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner
salt assay was performed to assess the sensitivity of cells to
drugs, as previously described [57].

PI/Annexin V assay
Apoptosis analysis was performed by staining
with Annexin V/7-AAD, using the Muse™ Cell Analyzer
