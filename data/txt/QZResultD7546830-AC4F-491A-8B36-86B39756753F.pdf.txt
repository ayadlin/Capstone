the hypoxic cells of solid tumors to be tested clinically. Cells at very
low oxygen concentrations are unique to solid tumors and confer
resistance to standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy (1–3). Thus,
a drug that selectively kills hypoxic cells would be expected to
improve standard treatment of solid tumors by killing the most
resistant cells in these tumors (4). Consistent with this, positive
results have been reported in a multicenter, randomized phase III
clinical trial combining tirapazamine with cisplatin (5), and
promising results have been reported with tirapazamine in
combination with chemoradiotherapy of head and neck cancer
(6). Phase III clinical trials of tirapazamine in combination with
chemotherapy and radiotherapy are ongoing.
The hypoxic selectivity of tirapazamine is the result of its
intracellular one-electron reduction to a radical anion that is back
oxidized to the parent nontoxic molecule by oxygen (7). In the
absence of oxygen, however, the radical anion is converted either to
a highly toxic hydroxyl radical (8) or to an oxidizing radical by the
elimination of water (9), either of which would be sufficient to
produce damage to intracellular macromolecules. We have
previously shown that DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are the
major contributor to the cytotoxicity of tirapazamine under
hypoxic conditions (10) and that these lesions seem to be formed
not by the direct action of the oxidizing radical on DNA but rather
by an indirect mechanism that, at least in some cell lines, is
produced by the action of topoisomerase II (11). In yeast, DSBs
generated by topoisomerase II poisons such as etoposide seem to
be repaired primarily by a pathway of homologous recombination
(12), but nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) may also play a role
(13). In contrast, the removal of topoisomerase II–mediated DSBs
induced by etoposide in mammalian cells occurs predominantly by
NHEJ (14). However, despite the fact that tirapazamine induces
DSBs through topoisomerase II, it does not act like a classic
topoisomerase II poison in that the cleavable complexes of
topoisomerase II stabilized by tirapazamine are much more
difficult to remove than the ones induced by etoposide (11). This
is likely to be the result of different mechanisms by which such
complexes are formed by tirapazamine and etoposide.
Using a genetic approach, we show in this study that different
repair pathways, including homologous recombination, base
excision repair (BER), and the XPF/ERCC1 factor of nucleotide
excision repair (NER), but not NHEJ and NER per se, play a
significant role in cell sensitivity to tirapazamine under hypoxia.
Such a sensitivity profile of tirapazamine closely resembles that of
agents producing DNA interstrand cross-links (15). Because

Abstract
Tirapazamine (3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4-dioxide) is a
promising hypoxia-selective cytotoxin that has shown significant activity in advanced clinical trials in combination with
radiotherapy and cisplatin. The current study aimed to
advance our understanding of tirapazamine-induced lesions
and the pathways involved in their repair. We show that
homologous recombination plays a critical role in repair of
tirapazamine-induced damage because cells defective in
homologous recombination proteins XRCC2, XRCC3, Rad51D,
BRCA1, or BRCA2 are particularly sensitive to tirapazamine.
Consistent with the involvement of homologous recombination repair, we observed extensive sister chromatid exchanges
after treatment with tirapazamine. We also show that the
nonhomologous end-joining pathway, which predominantly
deals with frank double-strand breaks (DSB), is not involved
in the repair of tirapazamine-induced DSBs. In addition, we
show that tirapazamine preferentially kills mutants both with
defects in XPF/ERCC1 (but not in other nucleotide excision
repair factors) and with defects in base excision repair.
Tirapazamine also induces DNA-protein cross-links, which
include stable DNA-topoisomerase I cleavable complexes. We
further show that ;H2AX, an indicator of DNA DSBs, is
induced preferentially in cells in the S phase of the cell cycle.
These observations lead us to an overall model of tirapazamine damage in which DNA single-strand breaks, base
damage, and DNA-protein cross-links (including topoisomerase I and II cleavable complexes) produce stalling and collapse
of replication forks, the resolution of which results in DSB
intermediates, requiring homologous recombination and
XPF/ERCC1 for their repair. [Cancer Res 2008;68(1):257–65]

Stanford, CA). The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained in a humidified incubator with 5%
CO2 at 37jC. WIL2NS lymphoblast cells ( from Jeff Schwartz, University of
Washington, Seattle, WA) were grown in RPMI medium containing 10%
bovine calf serum.
Human BRCA1-deficient HCC1937 cells, derived from a primary ductal
carcinoma of mammary gland arising in a BRCA1 carrier, were obtained
from ATCC. HCC1937 cells were cultured in Iscove’s medium supplemented
with 20% FBS (Sigma) and maintained at 37jC in a humidified incubator
with 7.5% CO2 at 37jC. The pcDNA3 vector expressing hemagglutinintagged human wild-type BRCA1 was provided by D. Livingston (DanaFarber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Human BRCA2-deficient EUFA423F
cells were obtained from A. D’Andrea (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston,
MA) and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37jC. The hemagglutinin-tagged BRCA2
plasmid was obtained from Barbara Weber (University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, PA) and was transfected into EUFA423F cells to derive the
BRCA2-complemented cell clone EUFA423B. Plasmid DNA transfections
were done using LipofectAMINE-Plus (Life Technologies) following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Tirapazamine treatment. Tirapazamine was obtained from SanofiSythelabo. Tirapazamine solutions were freshly prepared before each
experiment. For hypoxia treatment, cells were grown in notched glass
dishes. On addition of tirapazamine, cells were placed in prewarmed
hypoxic jigs, and the jigs were evacuated five times to 0.1 atm with a
mixture of N2 and 5% CO2 under constant shaking to achieve hypoxia of
<200 ppm O2. All hypoxia treatments were for 1 h at 37jC. Experiments with
BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells and the 51D1 cell lines were carried out
in a hypoxic chamber. For WIL2NS lymphoblast cells, hypoxia was achieved
with spinner flasks. Cells were incubated with tirapazamine for 30 min
under aerobic or anoxic conditions. Flasks were pre-gassed for 30 min with
5% CO2 in air or 5% CO2 in N2. Cells were incubated with continuous
gassing at a cell density of 8  105/mL (in 10 mL).
Measurement of sister chromatid exchange levels. Following treatments, cells were subcultured into medium containing 5¶-bromo-2¶deoxyuridine (Sigma) at a final concentration of 1  10 5 mol/L for two

tirapazamine itself is not known to produce DNA interstrand crosslinks, we therefore hypothesize that an important lesion, either
directly induced by tirapazamine or produced during repair of
tirapazamine-induced damage, is repaired by mechanisms similar
to the repair of an interstrand cross-link intermediate. Our data
support the hypothesis that tirapazamine induces DSBs as a result
of replication forks stalled or collapsed at unrepaired base damage,
single-strand breaks (SSB), or DNA-protein cross-links (including
DNA-topoisomerase II complexes) and which require homologous
recombination for their repair. These data emphasize the importance of the choice of patients who might be especially sensitive to
tirapazamine. In particular, the striking sensitivity of BRCAdeficient cancer cells to tirapazamine has important implications
for optimizing the systemic therapy of these tumors in the clinic.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, plasmids, and transfection. Rodent AA8, V79, UV41, UV5,
UV135, EM9, UV20, Polh(+/+), and Polh( / ) cell lines were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Irs1 and irs1SF, as well
as complemented cell lines CXR3, generated by the transfection of an
expression vector containing wild-type XRCC3 into irs1SF cells, and H9T3,
generated by the transfection of an expression vector containing wild-type
XRCC1 into EM9 cells, were a generous gift from L.H. Thompson (Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA), as were 51D1 (a knockout
of the RAD51D gene obtained by deletion of exon 4 in AA8 CHO cells) and
51D1.3 (a gene-complemented clone of 51D1 created by transfection of
51D1 cells with a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the complete
hamster RAD51D gene; ref. 16). Mouse Ku80( / ) cells were kindly provided by G.C. Li (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY).

Tirapazamine Repair Requires Homologous Recombination
Flow cytometry for ;H2AX. One hour after treatment with tirapazamine, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol. Following washes with PBS and
blocking with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin,
and 1% FBS, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-gH2AX
antibody (Upstate) for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were stained in PBS
containing 10 Ag/mL propidium iodide and 10 units/mL RNase A for at
least 1 h and were analyzed on FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson). The
populations of gH2AX-labeled cells were gated according to control
histograms and the average gH2AX antibody staining relative to the
untreated controls was calculated based on geometric mean fluorescence.
DNA-protein cross-link measurements. DNA-protein cross-links were
detected by the SDS/potassium precipitation method according to
Zhitkovich and Costa (18). Briefly, cellular DNA was labeled with
[14C]thymidine for 24 h and subsequently incubated in nonradioactive
medium before tirapazamine treatment. After drug treatment, cells were
washed and held at 4jC before processing for DNA-protein cross-links. The
cell pellets (106 cells) were then resuspended in 1 mL of PBS and were lysed
by the addition of 0.5 mL of 2% SDS solution. The lysates were vortexed and
heated at 65jC for 10 min and then mixed with 0.5 mL of precipitation
buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mmol/L KCl]. DNA was sheared by
passing the lysates through a 21-gauge needle. Samples were placed on ice
for 5 min to form potassium dodecyl sulfate precipitates. The precipitates
were collected by centrifugation at 6,000  g for 5 min at 4jC. After
removal of supernatants, the pellets were resuspended in wash buffer
[20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L KCl], vortexed, and heated for 10 min
at 65jC, and the washing steps as described above were repeated twice. The
DNA-protein cross-link coefficient was calculated as the ratio of the percent
of labeled DNA in the precipitated pellet of the treated sample divided by
that of the untreated control sample.
Detection of cellular topoisomerase I cleavage complexes. Topoisomerase I cleavage complexes were detected using the in vivo complex of
enzyme bioassay as described (19). Briefly, cells were lysed in 1% Sarkosyl

cycles (28 h), with colcemid (0.04 Ag/mL) being added for the final 3 h.
Cultures were harvested and metaphase spreads were prepared on microscope slides, which were then stained with Hoechst 33258 (5 Ag/mL; Sigma)
in 2 SSC buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Slides were then exposed
to 366-nm UV light (UVGL-58 MINERALIGHT Lamp) for 25 to 30 min.
Immediately after UV treatment, slides were incubated in 2 SSC at 60jC
for 30 min. Slides were dried and stained with 5% Giemsa for 15 min.
Metaphase spreads were viewed under bright-field microscopy and sister
chromatid exchange (SCE) was scored each time a color switch occurred.
Detection of base damage after tirapazamine treatment (comet
assay). After incubation, WIL2NS lymphoblast cells were centrifuged,
washed, and resuspended in PBS, then embedded in 1% low gelling
temperature agarose. Detection of base damage was done as previously
described (17) by pipetting 100-AL cell suspension containing 14,000 cells
onto an agarose-precoated slide. Coverslips were placed over agarose, which
was allowed to gel on an ice-cold block for 2 to 5 min. The coverslip was
then removed and slides were submersed horizontally in the permeabilization lysis buffer solution containing 10 mmol/L Tris, 0.1 mol/L Na2EDTA,
2.5 mol/L NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 10). After 1 h, slides were rinsed
free of salt and detergent in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl containing 1 mmol/L
EDTA and 100 mmol/L KCl (pH 7.5). Slides were then incubated in 60 AL of
the Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 85 ng of endonuclease III or 85 ng
of formamidopyrimidine-glycosylase (supplied by S.S. Wallace, University of
Vermont, Burlington, VT) or the combination of the two for 30 min at 37jC
in a humidified box before proceeding with the alkali comet assay. Slides
were placed in lysis solution containing 0.1% sarkosyl, 1.2 mol/L NaCl, and
0.03 mol/L NaOH for 45 min. Lysis was followed by rinsing in 0.03 mol/L
NaOH, 2 mmol/L EDTA for 2  20 min and then by electrophoresis
at 0.6 V/cm for 20 min. After staining DNA with propidium iodide, f150
comet images were analyzed for DNA damage using in-house software.
Tail moment was measured as the percentage of DNA in the tail and the
distance between the means of the head and tail distributions.

and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The cell lysates were
centrifuged on cesium chloride step gradients at 165,000  g for 20 h at
20jC. Twenty 0.5-mL fractions were collected and diluted (vol/vol) into
25 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6). The DNA-containing
fractions ( fractions 7–11) were pooled and applied to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore) using a slot-blot vacuum
manifold. Topoisomerase I cleavage complexes were detected by immunoblotting with the C21 Top1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution;
a kind gift from Dr. Yung-Chi Cheng, Yale University, New Haven, CT).

51D1 (Fig. 1B) and the XRCC2-deficient cell line irs1 (data not
shown). BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins, mutations in which account
for the majority of families with hereditary susceptibility to breast
and ovarian cancers, play important roles in regulating homologous recombination (20). We tested the sensitivity to tirapazamine
of the BRCA1-defective HCC1937 breast cancer cell line with and
without correction by the cDNA for BRCA1 and observed a large
increase in sensitivity to tirapazamine (by a factor of 6.1; Fig. 1C).
BRCA2-deficient EUFA423 cells, derived from a patient with Fanconi anemia complementation group D1, also show an increased
sensitivity to tirapazamine relative to a BRCA2-corrected clone
although not to the same extent as the BRCA1-deficient cell line
(Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data establish homologous recombination as an important determinant of tirapazamine cytotoxicity
in mammalian cells.
SCE levels are significantly elevated in tirapazamine-treated
cells. Homologous recombination has been suggested to be the
principal mechanism responsible for SCE formation in vertebrate
cells (21). In support of our data and conclusions from Fig. 1, we
observed extensive SCE formation after 5 Amol/L tirapazamine
under hypoxia in AA8 cells (Fig. 2B and D). In contrast, ionizing
radiation, the lesions of which are repaired largely by NHEJ, did not
increase SCE levels at equivalent cell killing level of 1 Gy (Fig. 2C
and D). As SCEs are the product of repair of DSBs by homologous
recombination, the data from Figs. 1 and 2 provide good evidence
that homologous recombination is involved in the repair of DSBs
generated after exposure to tirapazamine under hypoxia.
NHEJ mutants are not sensitive to tirapazamine. The
preferred mode for the repair of DSBs in mammalian cells is via
NHEJ. To test if NHEJ is important for resistance to tirapazamine in

Results
Homologous recombination–defective mutants are sensitive
to tirapazamine. To ascertain the importance of homologous
recombination for tirapazamine resistance, we tested a collection
of mutants with known defects in homologous recombination for
their sensitivity to tirapazamine under hypoxic conditions using
clonogenic assay. Irs1 and irs1SF are well-characterized hamster
cell lines derived from V79 and AA8 CHO cells, respectively, which
are defective in the Rad51 paralogues XRCC2 and XRCC3. In
addition, we tested a recently characterized knockout of Rad51D
in AA8 cell line (16). We treated these strains with various concentrations of tirapazamine under hypoxia for 1 h and compared
their sensitivity to that of their parental cell lines and, in some
cases, to the corrected versions of the strains that had been stably
transfected with the cloned cDNA for that gene. Irs1SF cells had a
3.6-fold increase in sensitivity to tirapazamine (determined as the
ratio of doses to give equal survival) compared with wild-type AA8
cells and irs1SF cells expressing a wild-type copy of the cDNA for
XRCC3 (Fig. 1A). A similar increase in sensitivity to tirapazamine
under hypoxia was observed for the Rad51D-knockout cell line

mutants defective in other NER factors, XPD (UV5 cells), XPG
(UV135 cells), and XPC (mag247 cell line), showed tirapazamine
sensitivity similar to that of wild-type AA8 cells (Fig. 3D) or the wildtype XPC complemented cell line mag249 (Fig. 3D).
BER is involved in the repair of tirapazamine-induced
damage. Under hypoxic conditions, tirapazamine undergoes oneelectron reduction by nuclear reductases, yielding highly reactive
radicals producing DNA strand breaks and base damage lesions
(27, 28). Normally, hypoxic conditions do not promote radicalmediated breakage of DNA because oxygen is required for the
conversion of DNA radicals into strand breaks. However, tirapazamine and its metabolites have been shown to produce oxygenation
of these radical sites leading to DNA breaks (29). In addition to DNA
strand breaks, tirapazamine under hypoxic conditions has been
reported to generate oxidative DNA base damage that is dominated
by formamidopyrimidine and 5-hydroxy-6-hydropyrimidine lesions
(30). These lesions would be expected to block DNA transcription
and replication and thus contribute to the cytotoxicity of the drug
(30). In addition, BER intermediates can be substrates for
topoisomerase II and poison the enzyme to produce double-strand
breaks (31). Consistent with this, we have shown that tirapazamine
is a topoisomerase II poison (11).
To quantitatively assess the amount of DNA base damage
induced by tirapazamine, we used the alkaline comet assay to
detect DNA strand breaks after treatment with endonuclease III
and formamidopyrimidine-glycosylase, enzymes known to create
DNA strand breaks at enzyme-sensitive sites. Figure 4A and B
shows a dose-dependent increase of DNA breaks and base damage
after tirapazamine treatment, with >20-fold higher levels of

mammalian cells, we compared two different mouse cell lines,
SCID and Ku80( / ), to their wild-type counterparts. Both of
these cell lines are defective in NHEJ and are hypersensitive to
agents that kill cells by producing DNA DSBs, such as ionizing
radiation. The murine SCID cell line has a well-characterized
mutation in a DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit that
significantly impairs DSB rejoining (22, 23), and Ku80( / ) cells
have a knockout mutation of the Ku80 subunit of the Ku70/Ku80
heterodimer that is responsible for the initial binding of the
DNA-dependent protein kinase complex to the broken ends of the
DNA (24). As shown in Fig. 3A and B, NHEJ plays little or no role in
the repair of tirapazamine lesions induced under hypoxia.
The structure-specific endonuclease ERCC1-XPF, but not
other NER factors, is required for resistance to tirapazamine.
NER is responsible for the removal of bulky lesions in DNA. The
process involves f30 proteins and consists of several steps, which
include damage recognition and formation of an incision bubble by
XPC-hHR23B, TFIIH (including XPB and XPD), XPA, RPA, and XPG;
incision 3¶ and 5¶ to the lesion by XPG and XPF/ERCC1; and DNA
repair synthesis and ligation mediated by Poly and Polq, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, replication factor C, and DNA ligase I.
Previous observations in hamster and yeast cells have shown that
XPF-ERCC1 has important functions outside of NER, participating
in interstrand cross-link repair and homologous recombination
(25, 26). Similarly to interstrand cross-link, repair of tirapazamineinduced damage required the non-NER function of XPF/ERCC1.
Figure 3C shows that UV41 and UV20 hamster cell lines, deficient
in XPF and ERCC1, respectively, were f2.5-fold more sensitive to
tirapazamine than the parental wild-type AA8 cell line, whereas

XRCC1 transfected into the EM9 cell line. In addition, Polh( / )
cells showed significantly increased (1.7-fold) sensitivity to tirapazamine compared with BER-proficient Polh(+/+) (Fig. 4D). These
results indicate that the BER pathway plays an important role in
the repair of tirapazamine-induced damage.
Assessment of H2AX phosphorylation induced by tirapazamine. Phosphorylation of histone H2AX (gH2AX) has been
identified as an early event after the production of DSBs. gH2AX
is detected on Ser139 at sites flanking DNA DSBs generated either by
exogenous stimuli or normally during V(D)J recombination and
class-switch recombination, as well as in association with DNA
replication. gH2AX immunofluorescence measured by flow cytometry has been proposed as a surrogate for cell killing by drugs that
create DSBs (including tirapazamine; ref. 33). Confirming the data
obtained in ref. 33, we found that gH2AX levels were significantly
higher in S-phase cells after tirapazamine treatment (Fig. 5A). The
increase in gH2AX immunofluorescence was dose dependent, and
although at higher doses of tirapazamine (15 Amol/L) most of the
cells were gH2AX positive, the S-phase cells had the most
pronounced increase in the gH2AX signal (Fig. 5A). Moreover,
failure to repair base damage and SSBs resulted in significantly

tirapazamine under normoxia required to achieve the same levels
of damage as under hypoxia.
To determine the role in tirapazamine resistance of the BER
pathway that deals mainly with base damage and SSB, we used the
EM9 hamster cell line, deficient in the XRCC1 gene, and a mouse
Polh( / ) knockout cell line. In the main BER pathway, involving
short-patch repair, Polh polymerase incorporates a single nucleotide and removes the abasic site using its AP lyase activity. XRCC1
has a broader role in BER, acting in both short-patch and longpatch BER. XRCC1 coordinates BER through multiple proteinprotein interactions stabilizing DNA ligase III, directly detecting
breaks, coordinating the binding and polymerase activity of Polh,
promoting an S phase–specific mode of SSB repair, and regulating
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (reviewed in ref. 32). EM9 cells have a
frameshift mutation in the XRCC1 gene that results in truncated
polypeptide lacking two thirds of the normal sequence, thus
leading to an effectively knockout phenotype of the EM9 cell line.
As shown in Fig. 4C, EM9 cell line has a 3-fold increase in
sensitivity to tirapazamine compared with the wild-type AA8 strain
of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, from which EM9 clone had
originated, and with the H9T3 cell line, which has the cDNA for

Tirapazamine Repair Requires Homologous Recombination

increased gH2AX levels in the EM9 mutant of XRCC1 after 5 Amol/L
tirapazamine (Fig. 5B), which were similar to the gH2AX levels in
AA8 cells treated with 15 Amol/L tirapazamine, a dose that
produces the equivalent cell kill (Fig. 5A).
DNA-protein cross-links. To determine whether tirapazamine
treatment of cells under hypoxia produces DNA-protein cross-links,
we used the SDS-potassium precipitation assay following a 1-h exposure to tirapazamine. We found a clear increase of DNA-protein
cross-link levels with increasing dose of tirapazamine (Fig. 6A).
However, higher levels of tirapazamine were needed to detect a
significant increase in DNA-protein cross-links compared with a
similar increase of base damage, probably reflecting the low
sensitivity of the SDS-potassium assay. The high reactivity of the
tirapazamine radical under hypoxia and the selective reduction
of tirapazamine by nuclear matrix reductases (27) suggest that
proteins cross-linked to DNA must be in close proximity to DNA.
Consistent with this, we found earlier that tirapazamine induces
irreversible DNA-topoisomerase II cleavable complexes (11) as well
as DNA complexes with other nuclear matrix proteins such as
nuclear lamin and NUMA1 (data not shown). Importantly, we
report here that exposure to tirapazamine under hypoxia results
in the formation of DNA-topoisomerase I cleavage complexes
(Fig. 6B). Similarly to DNA-topoisomerase II cleavable complexes,
DNA-topoisomerase I cleavage complexes are very stable and, in
contrast to DNA-topoisomerase I cleavage complexes induced by
camptothecin, do not reverse after 3-h incubation in tirapazaminefree medium (Fig. 6B).

the main pathway for repair of DSBs in yeast (35) whereas NHEJ is
the main pathway in mammalian cells (36), the results of this
screen in yeast do not necessarily imply that homologous
recombination would be the important repair pathway for the
DSBs induced by tirapazamine under hypoxic conditions. Nonetheless, we found that homologous recombination plays a major
role in repairing tirapazamine-induced damage in both hamster
and human cells. In particular, we show in this study that hamster
cells defective in the Rad51 paralogues, Rad51D, XRCC2, and
XRCC3, and human cells deficient in BRCA1 and BRCA2, all defective in homologous recombination, are significantly more sensitive
to tirapazamine than their normal counterparts (Fig. 1). Consistent
with this involvement of homologous recombination in processing
tirapazamine-induced damage, we also observed a high incidence
of SCEs after tirapazamine treatment (Fig. 2). On the other hand,
the NHEJ pathway, which we interrogated using mouse SCID and
Ku80( / ) cells, does not protect cells against tirapazamineinduced damage (Fig. 3A and B). This finding of the importance of
homologous recombination in the repair of tirapazamine damage
is consistent with our earlier finding that although tirapazamine
induces DNA DSBs, these are not formed directly by radical
damage to DNA but indirectly by producing cleavable complexes
between topoisomerase II and DNA (11). Our finding of the
high sensitivity of cells deficient in BRCA1 and BRCA2, proteins
involved in homologous recombination, also suggests that tirapazamine might be particularly effective in the therapy of homologous recombination–defective tumors. For breast cancer patients
carrying mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, the use of
tirapazamine in neoadjuvant therapy when breast cancers are
hypoxic (37) may result in a substantial improvement in response.
The phenotype that characterizes homologous recombination–
defective mutants is their extreme sensitivity to DNA interstrand
cross-linking agents. The hamster cell lines irs1, irs1SF, and 51D1
(defective in XRCC2, XRCC3, and Rad51D, respectively) plus

common elements. XPF/ERCC1, for example, seems to be involved
in the repair of both DNA-protein cross-links (46, 47) and DNA
interstrand cross-links (25, 39, 40).
Based on the results obtained in this study, we propose a model
that explains why tirapazamine induces DSBs, yet the repair of the
damage proceeds via pathways involved in the repair of SSBs,
base damage, and interstrand cross-links. This model is shown in
Fig. 6C. Essentially, we propose that the lesions induced by
tirapazamine, comprising SSBs (48), base damage (ref. 28; Fig. 4),
and DNA-protein cross-links (ref. 11; Fig. 6), produce DNA DSBs
when a replication fork encounters them, and these DSBs require
homologous recombination for their repair.
The model accounts for the following observations: (a) tirapazamine-induced damage repair depends on XPF/ERCC1, homologous recombination, and BER, but not on NER and NHEJ (which
acts on frank DSBs); (b) topoisomerase II-DNA complexes are
formed after tirapazamine treatment, which are more stable than
those produced by etoposide (11); (c) tirapazamine is a potent
inhibitor of DNA replication (49); and (d) gH2AX levels in
tirapazamine-treated cells are significantly higher in S phase,
which is not the case for cells treated with etoposide, doxorubicin,
bleomycin, or ionizing radiation (ref. 33; Fig. 5). Importantly, this
model also provides a ready explanation for the marked timedependent synergism between tirapazamine and cisplatin (50, 51):
the initial tirapazamine treatment would be expected to sequester
repair factors, such as XPF-ERCC1, needed for the repair of
cisplatin-induced intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links.
In summary, we have shown that repair of the damage induced
by the hypoxic cytotoxin tirapazamine requires the function of
multiple DNA repair enzymes, including those involved in
homologous recombination, BER, and the XPF/ERCC1 complex,
but not NHEJ and NER per se. The involvement of these enzymes
fits into a pathway that accounts for the known phenomena
associated with this drug and has implications for optimizing the
systemic therapy of tumors with defects in those pathways.

BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells all show this marked sensitivity
to the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C (16, 38). In addition to
homologous recombination, however, several lines of evidence
suggest that the repair of interstrand cross-links requires an
incisional step 5¶ to the lesion that involves the XPF-ERCC1
component of NER (25, 39, 40). Significantly, our data also show
that tirapazamine resistance involves the function of the XPFERCC1 complex but not of other components of the NER pathway,
as XPD-, XPG-, and XPC-deficient cells are not sensitive to
tirapazamine (Fig. 3C and D). Thus, the combination of enzymes
involved in the repair of tirapazamine-induced damage closely
resembles the one involved in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (41) despite the fact that tirapazamine is not known to
produce interstrand cross-links.
Recently, it was reported that BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells
are highly sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors
(42, 43). The authors propose that the mechanism for this sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors is by inhibition of
repair of SSBs produced during the removal of endogenously
generated base damage. During the S phase of the cell cycle, these
unrepaired SSBs are converted to DSBs, which then require the
homologous recombination pathway to restart the stalled replication forks. Consistent with this model, Saleh-Gohari et al. (44) have
recently shown that XRCC1-deficient EM9 cells have elevated levels
of spontaneously formed DSBs and RAD51 foci, again suggesting
that stalled replication forks convert SSBs into DSBs that require
homologous recombination for their repair. Thus, it seems
probable that some of the DSBs produced after treatment with
tirapazamine have a similar origin, as we show (Fig. 4C and D) that
cells deficient in EM9 and Polh( / ) cells are significantly more
sensitive to tirapazamine than their parental or cDNA-corrected
cells and that tirapazamine induces S phase–specific phosphorylation of H2AX, which is especially high in EM9 cells (Fig. 5).
What tirapazamine-induced damage would require a DNA
interstrand cross-link–like mechanism of processing? As we show
in this study, tirapazamine produces DNA-protein cross-links
(Fig. 6A and B) in addition to SSBs and base damage. These DNAprotein cross-links could be formed by reaction of radical-damaged
DNA with nearby proteins or by attempts to repair tirapazamineinduced base damage producing DNA-Polh cross-links (45) or
stable topoisomerase II-DNA complexes (11, 30, 31). The mechanism of repair of DNA-protein cross-links is not understood, but
because many DNA-protein cross-link–inducing agents also generate DNA interstrand cross-links, it has been proposed that both of
these types of lesions may be repaired by the same pathway or using
