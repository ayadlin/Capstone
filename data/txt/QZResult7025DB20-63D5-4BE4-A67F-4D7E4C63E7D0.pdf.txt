BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate severe mucocutaneous toxicity during treatment with
hydroxyurea (HU) in a large cohort of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms
(MPN). METHODS: Among 993 consecutive patients newly diagnosed with MPN at 4 centers in Rome between January 1980 and December 2009, 614 patients (277 men and 337 women with a median age of 64.4 years [interquartile
range (IR), 54.4 years-72.7 years]) received HU. HU was administered as first-line treatment in 523 patients (85.2%)
and as  second-line treatment in 91 patients (14.8%). RESULTS: Mucocutaneous toxicity was reported in 51 patients
(8.3%) after a median period from the initiation of HU treatment of 32.1 months (IR, 10.5 months-74.6 months) and a
mean HU dose of 1085 mg ( 390 mg); 30 patients (58.8%) developed a painful ulcerative skin toxicity, mainly
located in the perimalleolar area; 11 patients (21.6%) had oral aphthous ulcers; and 10 patients (19.6%) developed a
nonulcerative skin toxicity with erythema and skin infiltration. After the mucocutaneous toxicity occurred, HU treatment was continued at the same dose in 5 patients (9.8%), reduced in 12 patients (23.5%), and temporarily discontinued in 7 patients (13.7%); the remaining 27 patients (52.9%) required a permanent drug discontinuation. After a
median period of 4.3 months (IR, 2.4 months-9.0 months) from the onset of the skin toxicity, 39 patients (76.5%) had
a complete resolution and 12 patients (23.5%) had improvement without complete resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Mucocutaneous toxicity during HU treatment is more common than expected and may present with different clinical features. Moreover, it often requires a permanent drug discontinuation and only a partial resolution is reported to occur

Hydroxyurea (HU) was first synthesized in 1869 by Dresler and Stein,1 but initial testing of this substance in animal experiments was only performed in 1928 by Rosenthal, who discovered that HU can determine both leukocytopenia
and megaloblastic anemia.2

Skin Toxicity of Hydroxyurea in MPN/Latagliata et al

The antitumor activity of HU is based on inhibition
of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and hence the inhibition of DNA synthesis, specifically affecting the S
phase of the cell cycle.3
In the late 1950s, this drug was tested in several
mouse tumor models such as L 1210 and L 5178A leukemia, T 241 and MA 387 sarcoma, and Ridgway osteogenic sarcoma as well as against adenocarcinoma and
mammary carcinomas,4,5 and demonstrated clear activity
and efficacy.
Because of the proven efficacy of HU in these tumor
models, this substance was tested in clinical trials on a
wide range of advanced solid tumors, acute and chronic
leukemias, and myeloproliferative disorders. It was
promptly demonstrated that the drug was a highly effective cytostatic agent in chronic myeloproliferative disorders rather than in solid tumors.
In the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, HU remains
the treatment of choice only in Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) such
as polycythemia vera,6 essential thrombocythemia,7 and
symptomatic myelofibrosis.8
The most common side effects of HU are mild, and
include granulocytopenia and anemia, especially after
long-term treatment. Other common side effects include
fatigue, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or fever
that seldom cause discontinuation of the drug.
The occurrence of painful leg ulcers is a rare complication that has been described in patients receiving highdose, long-term HU treatment, often leading to drug discontinuation.9 To the best of our knowledge, to date only
single case reports10-18 or single-center experiences19-22
have been published regarding this phenomenon, with a
reported incidence ranging from 5% to 10% of the treated
patients. A 5% incidence of skin ulcers during HU treatment also has been reported in a large randomized trial in
patients with essential thrombocythemia.23
In addition to skin ulcers, several other mucocutaneous alterations have been reported during treatment with
HU, ranging from very mild (hyperpigmentation, nail
discoloration, alopecia, and scaling) to severe and uncomfortable toxicities (oral aphtosis, dermatomyositis-like
eruptions). However, to our knowledge, complete and exhaustive descriptions of these skin toxicities other than leg
ulcers are still lacking in literature.
The ‘‘Gruppo Laziale SMPC Ph1 negative’’ has
reviewed Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPN databases from 4 hematological centers to analyze the incidence, characteristics, and prognostic factors related to

symptomatic mucocutaneous toxicities occurring during
HU treatment in a large cohort of unselected patients.
The results of this analysis are reported in the current
study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
From January 1980 to December 2009, a total of 993
patients (483 men and 510 women with a median age of
60.5 years [interquartile range (IR), 20.0 years -92.7
years]) with newly diagnosed MPN were registered in 4
hematological institutions in Rome, Italy.
The diagnosis of MPN was made according to Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria until January 2002
and according to World Health Organization revised criteria after that date. There were 476 patients (47.9%)
with essential thrombocythemia, 347 patients (34.9%)
with polycythemia vera, 140 patients (14.1%) with primary myelofibrosis, and 30 patients (3.1%) with unclassifiable chronic myeloproliferative disorders.
Definition of Mucocutaneous Toxicity
After the exclusion of other known causes of skin toxicity,
a symptomatic HU-dependent mucocutaneous toxicity
was defined as the appearance of any cutaneous or oral
mucosal manifestation of clinical significance (ie, with
clinical symptoms such as pruritus or local pain) during
treatment with HU.
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as the mean  the standard deviation
(normally distributed data), the median and IR (non-normally distributed data), or as percentage frequencies.
Within-patient comparisons were made using the Student
t test for paired data and the chi-square test as appropriate,
at significance levels of P < .05.
All calculations were made using a standard statistical software package (SPSS for Windows Version 15.0;
SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Among the 993 registered and evaluable patients, 614
(61.8%) received treatment with HU during the course of
their disease. A total of 523 patients (85.2%) received HU
as first-line treatment whereas 91 patients (14.8%)
received the drug as second- or third-line treatment.
The development of a mucocutaneous toxicity during HU treatment was observed in 51 of 614 patients

(8.3%) after a median period of 32.1 months (IR, 10.5
months-74.6 months) from the initiation of HU and a
mean HU dose of 1085 mg ( 390 mg). The clinical
features of these patients are reported and compared with
those of patients without mucocutaneous toxicities in
Table 1.
According to the different clinical features, 3 types
of mucocutaneous toxicities were recognized and
considered.
Ulcerative Skin Toxicity
Thirty patients (58.8% of the patients with a mucocutaneous toxicity and 4.9% of all patients treated with HU)
developed a painful ulcerative skin toxicity (UST) that
was located in the perimalleolar area in 26 of 30 cases
(86.7%) (Fig. 1 Top). In the remaining patients, the UST
affected the head (2 patients) or feet (2 patients).
Oral Aphtosis
A total of 11 patients (21.6% of the patients with a mucocutaneous toxicity and 1.8% of all patients treated with
HU) developed oral aphthous ulcers (Fig. 1 Middle).
Nonulcerative Skin Toxicity
Ten patients (19.6% of the patients with a mucocutaneous toxicity and 1.6% of all patients treated with HU)

406

developed a nonulcerative skin toxicity (NUST), characterized by erythema and skin infiltration (diffuse in 2
patients and localized to the head or extremities in 5
patients and 3 patients, respectively) (Fig. 1 Bottom).
Table 2 shows some relevant characteristics of these
different types of skin toxicities. There was no difference
with regard to the mean HU dose; however, oral aphthous
ulcers were found to be an early toxicity (median time
from the initiation of HU therapy, 2.1 months; IR, 1.6
months-9.4 months), whereas UST and NUST were
found to be late complications (median time from the initiation of HU therapy, 37.6 months [IR, 24.7 months91.5 months] and 36.1 months [IR, 17.0 months-64.5
months], respectively) (P ¼ .001).
After the occurrence of symptomatic mucocutaneous toxicities, HU treatment was continued at the same
dose in 5 patients (9.8%) and at a reduced dose in 12
patients (23.5%), and was temporarily discontinued in 7
patients (13.7%); the remaining 27 patients (52.9%)
required a permanent drug discontinuation (Table 2). In
this latter group, HU was replaced by pipobroman (18
patients), anagrelide (6 patients), melphalan (2 patients),
or interferon-a (1 patient).
After a median of 4.3 months (IR, 2.4 months-9.0
months) from the onset of the mucocutaneous toxicity
to the better response achieved, 39 patients (76.5%)

achieved a complete resolution and 12 patients (23.5%)
demonstrated an improvement without complete resolution (Table 2); for example, it was common to observe a
stable or recurring insignificant skin ulcer without pain or
other local symptoms in patients with an UST who
achieved an improvement without complete resolution.
There was no difference noted in the rate of complete and
partial resolution among the different types of toxicity,
but oral aphthous ulcers and NUST were found to have a
shorter median time of resolution compared with UST
(3.3 months [IR, 0.8 months-6.6 months] and 3.1
months [IR, 3.0 months-8.4 months] vs 6.0 months [IR,
3.1 months-16.5 months], respectively) (P ¼ .04).
Several clinical and biological features (age at diagnosis, gender, type of MPN, Janus kinase [JAK]-2 mutational status, white blood cell count and platelet count at
the time of diagnosis, concomitant diabetes and dyslipidemia, smoking history, previous thrombotic events, firstline or second-line HU treatment, and HU dose) were
compared on univariate analysis between patients with
and those without symptomatic mucocutaneous toxicity;
no predictive factor for the development of such complications was detected (Table 1).

DISCUSSION
HU is a well-known cytostatic drug that is used to treat
patients with many hematological diseases. Its safe toxicity
profile has led to the use of HU in the treatment of elderly
and frail patients as palliative therapy, as well as in some
non-neoplastic settings such as sickle cell anemia. In
patients with high-risk MPN, in whom a long-lasting
treatment is required, HU currently appears to be the
most effective and safe first-line choice, as has been shown
Cancer

January 15, 2012

also in randomized trials23; HU cytotoxicity in particular
does not appear to translate into a higher risk of second
therapy-related neoplasia.
The skin constitutes a specific target of HU toxicity;
the majority of the skin alterations observed during HU
treatment are mild and do not lead to dose modifications
or discontinuations. However, there are some rare types of
mucocutaneous toxicity that are symptomatic and often
require a permanent discontinuation of HU therapy.
Among them, painful skin ulcers have been reported for
many years in several single cases or unicentric small
cohorts of patients.10-22 Currently, the occurrence of skin
ulcers during HU treatment is considered a treatment failure24; nonetheless, a full and specific evaluation of symptomatic mucocutaneous toxicity during HU treatment in
a large multicentric study focusing on incidence, clinical
features, and follow-up is still lacking.
The results of the current study demonstrate that
8.3% of MPN patients receiving HU treatment developed
a severe mucocutaneous toxicity, with no difference noted
with regard to MPN type, clinical features, JAK-2 mutational status, and predisposing conditions. It is worth noting that skin ulcers, often reported in previous small
studies, represented 58.8% of the severe mucocutaneous
toxicities; the remaining 41.2% of toxicities were comprised of oral aphtosis and NUST, which are less recognized complications but represented a significant
percentage of the phenomenon.
Although oral aphtosis was an early complication
and was never observed after the first 12 months of treatment, UST and NUST developed after a median treatment period of 36 months and therefore are to be
considered as late complications.

Original Article

On the basis of single, fully described case reports, a
general agreement exists concerning the complete healing
of mucocutaneous toxicities, nearly always after permanent discontinuation of HU. However, in the current
study cohort, there was a percentage of patients who did
not achieve complete regression of mucocutaneous toxicities even after interruption of HU, with rates ranging
from 20% of patients with NUST to 30% of patients
with UST; moreover, permanent HU discontinuation
was often but not always needed, and at least one-third of
patients achieved skin healing while continuing HU therapy at the same or a reduced dose.
Considering that only 8.3% of the patients in the
current study receiving HU were affected by skin complications, a major issue of this study was to identify predisposing factors. Our analysis, which took into account
several clinical features, was unsuccessful in demonstrating any predisposing factor. Therefore, it is not possible at
the current time to select patients at high risk of developing skin toxicities in whom HU should be avoided.
The pathogenesis of mucocutaneous toxicities developing during HU treatment is still unclear. There was no
relation noted between HU dose and the development of
a skin toxicity; furthermore, the mean HU dose in
patients with a mucocutaneous toxicity was unexpectedly
low. Both these features point to the importance of still
unknown individual biologic characteristics predisposing
toward skin toxicity rather than a direct dose-dependent
toxic effect of the drug. In particular, possible candidates
for the development of a skin toxicity may be genetic
polymorphisms of the genes involved in drug metabolism
as well as in skin growth.
In conclusion, symptomatic mucocutaneous toxicity during HU treatment is more common than
expected, with an incidence of approximately 8%, and
may present with different clinical features; moreover,
it often requires a permanent drug discontinuation and
in approximately 25% of patients there is only a partial
resolution. Thus, further studies are warranted to highlight the pathogenesis, as well as individual predisposing factors that could be different in the various types
of mucocutaneous toxicity.
