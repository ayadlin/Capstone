ABSTRACT
Autophagy (macroautophagy) is well known as an evolutionarily conserved
lysosomal degradation process for long-lived proteins and damaged organelles.
Recently, accumulating evidence has revealed a series of small-molecule compounds
that may activate or inhibit autophagy for therapeutic potential on human diseases.
However, targeting autophagy for drug discovery still remains in its infancy. In this
study, we developed a webserver called Autophagic Compound-Target Prediction
(ACTP) (http://actp.liu-lab.com/) that could predict autophagic targets and relevant
pathways for a given compound. The flexible docking of submitted small-molecule
compound (s) to potential autophagic targets could be performed by backend reverse
docking. The webpage would return structure-based scores and relevant pathways
for each predicted target. Thus, these results provide a basis for the rapid prediction
of potential targets/pathways of possible autophagy-activating or autophagyinhibiting compounds without labor-intensive experiments. Moreover, ACTP will be
helpful to shed light on identifying more novel autophagy-activating or autophagyinhibiting compounds for future therapeutic implications.

INTRODUCTION

a guardian or executioner [8–11]. The different roles of
autophagy depend on disease stages, surrounding cellular
environment, and attempted therapeutic interventions
[12–15].
Accordingly, targeting autophagy may be a promising
therapeutic strategy for treatment of diseases. Recently,
accumulating evidence has revealed many small-molecule
compounds that can activate or inhibit autophagy and may
therefore have remarkable therapeutic potential on diseases,
such as cancers and neurodegenerative diseases [16, 17].
However, targeting autophagy for drug development
remains in its infancy. Here, we designed a webserver called
Autophagic Compound-Target Prediction (ACTP) (http://
actp.liu-lab.com/) that can predict potential autophagic
targets and relevant pathways for given compound (s).
The ACTP webserver will help to explore more possible
autophagy-activating or autophagy-inhibiting drugs for
potential therapeutic purposes.

Autophagy refers to an evolutionarily conserved,
multi-step lysosomal degradation process, in which a
cell degrades long-lived proteins and damaged organelles
[1, 2]. Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as
autophagy) is a major, regulated catabolic mechanism that
involves the delivery of cytoplasmic cargo sequestered
inside double-membrane vesicles to the lysosome [3],
and is linked to several pathological processes, including
cancers and neurodegenerative diseases [4, 5]. Autophagy
is considered as a physiological mechanism that may
serve as a means for temporary survival and provide a
way to recycle macromolecules as an alternative energy
source. If cellular stress leads to continuous or excessively
induced autophagy, cell death will ensue [6, 7]. Several
studies have reconciled the opposing roles of autophagy in
diseases and demonstrated that autophagy can act as either

RESULTS

Target prediction and pathways for
autophagy-activating or autophagyinhibiting compounds

Potential autophagic targets in ACTP
We collected 430 target proteins (199 were reviewed,
and 231 were unreviewed) from Uniprot. The basic protein
information included the accession number, full name,
and molecular function. We identified GO annotation
terms and related diseases information from the Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. Crystal
structures of 86 targets were downloaded from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) and saved as 948 PDB files. Six hundred
and fifteen PDB structures were selected as available
structures for docking, and their PDB codes were also
saved (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). We prefer to
retain PDBs that have both high resolution and complete
amino acid motif covering active sites and compoundbinding sites. For those PDBs have better resolution and
worst coverage than a second one, we will firstly consider
the sequence integrity (that means the PDB entry has a
complete amino acid motif covering active sites and
compound-binding sites) rather than resolution; thus, we
will retain PDBs have complete amino acids motif even if
they have relative lower resolution. For those PDBs have
lower resolution and worst coverage, we will perform
homology modeling instead of using these PDBs. These
proteins were assigned to the following 9 functional target
groups: antigen, enzyme, kinase, receptor, protein binding,
nucleotide binding, transcription factor binding, tubulin
binding, and others (Figure 1). For reviewed proteins
without available crystal structures and the BLAST result
with the template shown > 30% similarity, we performed
homology modeling to generate predicted structures
using Discovery Studio 3.5 (Supplementary Table S2 and
Supplementary Table S3). 109 protein sequence files were
downloaded from Uniprot and saved in FASTA format.
Then, the templates were found using BLAST. Finally, the
structures of 109 targets were generated and saved in PDB
format. In addition, the PDB files were available from the
corresponding PDB number hyperlink on the result page
of the webserver. For example, the mTOR file contains the
following information: the accession number, “P42345”;
the name, “Serine/threonine-protein kinase mTOR
(Mechanistic target of rapamycin)”; and the function,
“Serine/threonine protein kinase is a central regulator of
cellular metabolism, growth and survival in response to
hormones, growth factors, nutrients, energy, and stress
signals. mTOR can activate or inhibit the phosphorylation
of at least 800 proteins directly or indirectly.” The PDB
accession number for mTOR is 4dri, and the PDB file
was downloaded from http://rcsb.org. Discovery Studio
3.5  was then used to prepare the PDB file for docking
by deleting water, cleaning the protein, and detecting the
interaction site.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The docking results were shown in a table of target
proteins and include the top 10 docking scores and the
P-value of the score. In this study, we used rapamycin
and LY294002 as an example. We found that mTOR has
the best binding score with rapamycin, 151.062; while
PI3K has the best binding score with LY294002, 162.157
(Figure 2A). Rapamycin and LY294002 bound perfectly
in the mTOR and PI3K inhibitor pocket, respectively.
Moreover both of them had a similar conformation in
different docking algorithms (Figure 2B).
To construct the global human PPI network based
on PrePPI, we collected 24,035 human protein accession
numbers from Uniprot and saved them in a text file.
The results page was created using PHP with accession
numbers from the text file and request interaction data. All
the information were imported into MySQL database. As
a result, 1.1 million PPIs were collected to construct the
global network. We generated the ARP subnetwork and
created the autophagy subnetwork, which contains 93,532
PPIs. The autophagy subnetwork data were also available
on the “download” page. It was combined with PHP and
MySQL web2.0 to generate a dynamic graphical network.
For example, mTOR has 308 PPIs and PI3K has 60 PPIs
in their cytoscape visual network. The target was in the
center and was marked in yellow. The targets of high
and low credible level ARP were displayed in green and
gray, respectively (Figure 2C). Moreover we carried out
an additional blind-test with 15 compounds with known
targets (Supplementary Table S4). And, the result showed
the predict targets with the significant Libdock score of
14 compounds contained the real target of the compound
(10 compounds’ real target had the top Libdock score).
Only one compound’s predicted targets result did not
contain the real target. Thus, it suggests that ACTP has
a reliable accuracy for predict the target of autophagyactivating or autophagy-inhibiting compounds.

Webserver development
Based upon the above-mentioned results, we
developed the ACTP webserver to offer a simple interface
for users to submit compounds and predict their potential
targets. For the first time, a user should create an account
to submit compounds and view the results though the
user interface. We support either CAS number or mol/
mol2 files as the submission format. When submitted,
the compound is sent to the Discovery Studio to perform
virtual screening with ARPs. We would notify the users
when the job is complete. If a user has submitted any
compound previously, the webserver will display the

results directly. The results page includes not only the
docking scores and a snap-shot, but important information
about the target proteins. For example, if rapamycin was
submitted, the input can be either 53123–88–9 or a mol/
mol2 file. Then, the task and process stage are shown on
a user dashboard. When the task is complete, the user can
click “VIEW” to see the score table, target information
and PPIs (Figure 3). Currently, a due to the limitation of
server is that a user could only submit 5 tasks per day.

few of them has been purposefully designed as autophagic
activators or inhibitors. Thus, it is urgent to find an avenue
for rapidly screening and identifying a wealth of possible
autophagy-activating or autophagy-inhibiting compounds
without labor-intensive experiments.
Herein, we designed the Autophagic CompoundTarget Prediction (ACTP) (http://actp.liu-lab.com/)
webserver, which can predict  a specific compound’s
autophagic targets and relevant pathways. We used a
series of bioinformatics methods to assemble together
for solving only one problem. When a given compound
has been submitted, we could correspondingly predict
its potential autophagic targets and relevant pathways
for therapeutic purposes. There are some key points for
our methods to construct the ACTP webserver. Firstly,
the autophagy-related protein (ARP) data were collected
and classified into different subclasses for accurate target
identification. Secondly, autophagic targets and their
relevant pathways were provided for possible mechanism
analysis. Lastly but most importantly, autophagic
targets and relevant pathways could be predicted
according to given compounds by structure-based docking
technique. Interestingly, the ACTP could provide a clue

DISCUSSION
Autophagy may possess the contradictory functions
because in addition to being primarily a survival
mechanism, it can also lead to type II programmed cell
death (type II PCD) under certain conditions [18, 19]. Our
understanding of the relationship between autophagy and
diseases has benefited from the availability of rapamycin
and other autophagy-activating or autophagy-inhibiting
agents, such as tamoxifen, chloroquine and resveratrol,
which have been approved for potential clinical use [20, 21].
Several small-molecule compounds have been reported to
activate or inhibit autophagy in different diseases. However,

the following groups: peptide antigen binding, other enzymes, kinases, receptors, transcription factor binding, protein binding, nucleotide
binding, tubulin binding and others. Groups are marked with different colors. The number of targets contained in each group is displayed
in the pie chart.

for themselves prone to activators or inhibitors of these
predicted autophagic targets.
Of course, there are some limitations for ACTP. The
binding sites of the reviewed targets are directly imported
from PDB files; thus, ACTP cannot predict the binding of
compounds to other pockets. Moreover, for many proteins,
the structures are not available yet, and the homology
modeling is not sufficiently accurate for prediction.
Therefore, ACTP cannot currently confirm the results
for these proteins. However, with a growing number of
protein structures to be analyzed, we will continue to add
some new protein structures, which could be used for
accurate target prediction. Moreover, we plan to update
the latest data every two months, enabling continuous
improvement of the webserver and processes.
In summary, Autophagic Compound-Target
Prediction (ACTP) may provide a basis for the rapid
prediction of potential targets and relevant pathways for a
given autophagy-modulating compound. These results
will help a user to assess whether the submitted compound
can activate or inhibit autophagy by targeting which kind
of key autophagic proteins and also has a therapeutic
potential on diseases. Importantly, ACTP will also provide
a clue to guide further experimental validation on one
or more autophagy-activating or autophagy-inhibiting
compounds for future drug discovery.

the AMPK agonist named compound 991 is envisaged
to strengthen the interaction between the kinase and
carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) to protect a major
proportion of the active enzyme against dephosphorylation
[25]. If available, ARP crystal structures were downloaded
from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) website (www.rcsb.
org) [27]. For proteins that have more than one PDB entry,
we screened the PDB files by resolution and sequence
length until only one PDB entry remained. For proteins
without crystal structure, we created homology modeling
from sequences using Discovery Studio 3.5 (Accelrys,
San Diego, California, United States). Sequence data
were downloaded from Uniprot in FASTA format, and
the templates were identified using BLASTP (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
ARPs were divided into two credibility levels (high and
low) according to their review status in Uniprot.

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network
construction
The cellular biological processes of specific targets
were predicted based on the global architecture of PPI
network. We used an in-house PHP script to construct
Autophagy interaction networks (AINs) based on the
global PPI network were from PrePPI database (https://
bhapp.c2b2.columbia.edu/PrePPI) [28] and Uniprot
accession numbers. The ARP accession numbers were
used to generate an AIN subnetwork. PPIs with different
credible levels were marked in ACTP. The interactions
were recorded in SQL format, which could be imported
into MySQL database. The Cytoscape web plug-in was
used to visualize the interactions [29].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Target protein information collection and
preprocessing
Autophagy-related proteins (ARPs) included genes
or proteins that are associated with the Gene Ontology
(GO) term “autophagy” (http://www.geneontology.org)
[22]. The useful information on ARPs was extracted from
Uniprot database (http://www.uniprot.org). Autophagic
targets were classified based on their molecular functions.
Targets were assigned to 9 functional target groups.
Cluster analysis was deemed to be relevant if the overrepresented functional groups contained at least 5 targets.
Moreover, functional clustering was performed by the
DAVID functional annotation tool (http://david.abcc.
ncifcrf.gov/). The functional categories were GO terms
that is related to molecular function (MF). Specific
docking strategies were employed for different groups.
For instance, kinase binding pockets were focused on
the active sites, while antigens were focused on their
interaction surfaces with other proteins. It may reduce
the number of false positive results in in silico analysis
[23, 24]. Also, the active sites were divided into two
groups by their position for predicting if a compound is an
inhibitor or agonist of the target [25, 26]. Taken a kinase
as an example, inhibitors targeting active sites for kinases,
the agonists were chose screening sites for according to the
different regulation mechanism of kinases. For example,

Webserver generation
The ACTP webserver was generated with Linux,
Apache, MySQL and PHP. Users can inquiry the database
with their private data through the web interface.
Currently, all major web browsers are supported. The
processed results will be returned to the website. Web
2.0 technologies (i.e., JavaScript/AJAX and CSS
functionalities) enables interactive data analysis. For
example, based on AJAX and flash, ARP interaction
networks can be indexed by accession numbers and
visualized on the web page with Cytoscape web.

Reverse docking
Reverse docking is the virtual screening of targets
by given compounds based on various scoring functions.
Reverse docking allows a user to find the protein targets
which can bind to a particular ligand [30]. We performed
reverse docking with Libdock protocol [31], which is a
high-throughput docking algorithm that positions catalystgenerated compound conformations in protein hotspots.

Oncotarget

Before docking, force fields including energies and forces
on each particle in a system were applied with CHARMM
[32] to define the positional relationships among atoms
and to detect their energy. The binding site image consists
of a list of non-polar hot spots, and positions in the binding
site that were favorable for a non-polar atom to bind. Polar
hot spot positions in the binding site were favorable for
the binding of a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor. For
Libdock algorithm, a given ligand conformation was put
into the binding site as a rigid body and the atoms of the
ligand were matched to the appropriate hot spots. The
conformations were ranked using the following score:

various conformations of compounds within a receptor.
Target-compound interactions were further optimized
by molecular dynamics using CHARMM and Clean
Geometry function of Discovery Studio. A T-test was also
add to analyze the significance of the Libdock score of
each target.
