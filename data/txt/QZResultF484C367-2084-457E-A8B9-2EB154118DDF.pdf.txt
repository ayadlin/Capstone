Abstract
Recent evidence suggests that pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors contain a subset of tumorigenic
cells capable of extensive self-renewal that contribute to metastasis and treatment resistance. Sorafenib (SO) is
a promising new multikinase inhibitor for treatment of advanced kidney and liver cancers. We report here
targeting of pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSC) by SO and the development of a strategy to enhance this effect.
Although SO administration diminished clonogenicity, spheroid formation, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1
(ALDH1) activity, growth on immunodeficient mice, proliferation, and angiogenesis and induced apoptosis,
we observed SO-induced activation of NF-κB associated with survival and regrowth of spheroids. For enhanced elimination of CSC characteristics by SO, we cotreated cells with sulforaphane (SF). This broccoli isothiocyanate was recently described to eliminate pancreatic CSCs by downregulation of NF-κB activity without
inducing toxic side effects. On combination treatment, SF completely eradicated SO-induced NF-κB binding,
which was associated with abrogated clonogenicity, spheroid formation, ALDH1 activity, migratory capacity,
and induction of apoptosis. In vivo, combination therapy reduced the tumor size in a synergistic manner. This
was due to induction of apoptosis, inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis, and downregulation of
SO-induced expression of proteins involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Our data suggest that SF
may be suited to increase targeting of CSCs by SO. Cancer Res; 70(12); 5004–13. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy characterized by an extensive local invasion, early systemic dissemination, and pronounced resistance to chemotherapy and
radiotherapy (1). Increasing evidence indicates that human
pancreatic cancer is driven by “tumor-initiating cells” popularly also known as “cancer stem cells” (CSC) that may contribute
to tumor metastasis and therapeutic resistance (2–5). We have
recently shown that a CD24−/CD44+ phenotype characterizes
the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1)–positive, therapyresistant, spheroid, and colony-forming population in MIAPaCa2, AsPC1, Capan-1, and BxPc-3 pancreatic cancer cell
lines (6). Importantly, conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy does not completely eradicate CSCs in pancreatic

cancer (7, 8), suggesting the need for novel therapies based
on the elimination of CSCs.
Sorafenib (SO), a novel multikinase inhibitor, also known
as BAY 43-9006 or Nexavar, has shown promising antitumor
activity in several clinical phase I/II combination studies
with oxaliplatin (9), 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (10), gemcitabine (11), doxorubicin (12), docetaxel (13), and paclitaxel
plus carboplatin (14). Multiple phase I, II, and III trials with
SO alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic
drugs are ongoing. Mechanistically, SO inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 and VEGF receptor-3
expressed by endothelial cells and CD133+ circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells (15) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor-β, FLT3, Ret, and c-Kit expressed by vasculatureassociated cells and tumor cells (16, 17). These kinases are
involved in tumor angiogenesis, as well as in growth and progression of a variety of tumor types such as leukemias and
renal cell and hepatocellular carcinomas, suggesting CSC
targeting by SO. However, recent studies in mouse models
of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, glioblastoma, and
breast cancer showed an unwanted side effect of SO and
related antiangiogenic substances: After initial antitumor activity, enhanced tumor progression and increased metastasis
occurred (18, 19). The underlying mechanism may be due to
induction of hypoxia by antiangiogenic treatment and selection of highly resistant CSCs adapted to depletion of oxygen
and nutrition. Therefore, combination of SO with a “sensitizer”
may be necessary for complete elimination of CSCs. A

Targeting of Pancreatic Cancer Stem Cells

promising candidate for combination is the dietary food component sulforaphane (SF). This isothiocyanate is enriched in
the plant family of Brassicaceae and present in high concentration in broccoli. SF inhibits phase 1 cytochrome P450 enzymes,
induces phase 2 metabolic enzymes, and acts as an antioxidant by increasing reduced glutathione levels as well as inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, SF
exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and inhibits angiogenesis (20). SF has recently been shown to sensitize pancreatic
CSCs by downregulation of NF-κB along with inhibition of
CSC properties (e.g., ALDH1 and self-renewal activity,
apoptosis resistance, and growth in immunodeficient mice;
ref. 6).
In the present study, we used in vitro assays and in vivo
xenograft models to examine the effects of SO on the pancreatic CSC population. We showed that CSCs are diminished
by SO, although some clones acquire resistance. This may
be due to the observed strong induction of NF-κB signaling
by SO. Therefore, we used SF cotreatment, which completely
downregulated NF-κB activity and strongly increased the
anti-CSC properties of SO.

Materials and Methods
Human primary and established cell lines
BxPc-3 (CSC low ) and MIA-PaCa2 (CSC high ) pancreatic
cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and authenticated throughout the
culture by the typical morphology. Mycoplasma-negative
cultures were ensured by weekly tests. Primary skin fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. H-J. Stark (DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were cultured in DMEM (PAA)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Sigma) and
25 mmol/L HEPES (PAA). Human mesenchymal stem/
stromal cells were isolated from bone marrow and cultured
as described (21).
Reagents
Sorafenib tosylate [N-(3-trifluoromethyl-4-chlorophenyl)-N′(4(2-methylcarbamoyl pyridin-4-yl)oxyphenyl) urea] was
kindly provided by Bayer Corporation (West Haven, CT)
and dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) to a 100 mmol/L
stock. This stock was further diluted for in vivo studies in a
Cremophor EL/100% ethanol mixture (1:1 ratio) to a
4× stock. Sulforaphane [1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl)butane] (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in 100% ethanol to a
stock solution of 100 mmol/L. For in vivo studies, this stock
was further diluted with sterile PBS. A 40 mmol/L Z-VADFMK stock (Promega) was prepared in DMSO. The concentration of DMSO in the working solutions did not exceed
0.1% (v/v).
Xenograft tumor models
MIA-PaCa2 tumor cells (2 × 107 in 200 μL of PBS) were
injected s.c. into the left and right flanks of 4-week-old NMRI
(nu/nu) female mice. Two weeks later, xenografts were
minced and subtransplanted into 6-week-old mice. After
the tumors had reached a mean diameter of 8 to 10 mm,

mice were randomized to six groups of six animals per
group. The mice were treated i.p. on 3 consecutive days
with SF at a dose of 3 mg/kg or with SO at doses of 30,
40, and 60 mg/kg or with a combination of SF (3 mg/kg)
and SO (60 mg/kg). The control group received a Cremophor EL/95% ethanol/PBS mixture (1:1:6 ratio). Tumor
growth was monitored as described recently (6). Animal
experiments have been carried out at the animal facility
of the University of Heidelberg after approval by the Baden
Württemberg animal oversight committee (Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, Germany).
Measurement of apoptosis
Cells were stained with Nicoletti buffer as described (22)
and DNA fragmentation was identified by flow cytometry
(FACScan, BD Biosciences).
Viability assay
Viability was measured using MTT as described previously.
Spheroid formation assay
Tumor cells were cultured in human NeuroCult NS-A basal
serum-free medium with supplements (StemCell Technologies,
Inc.) and spheroid formation was evaluated as described (6).
Colony formation assay
Tumor cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 per well in
six-well tissue culture plates (BD Falcon). Twenty-four hours
later, the cultures were pretreated with SF for 24 hours and
subsequently treated with SO for 48 hours. Afterward, cells
were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and resuspended in cell
culture medium at a density of 200 per well in six-well tissue
culture plates and colony formation was evaluated as
described (23).
Scratch assay
MIA-PaCa2 cells (6 × 105) were seeded in six-well plates
and grown to confluence. Twenty-four hours after treatment,
a line was scraped within confluent cells using the fine end of
a 10-μL pipette tip (time 0).
Detection of ALDH1 activity
ALDEFLUOR substrate (5 μL; Aldagen, Inc.) was added to
1 × 106 treated tumor cells in 500 μL of assay buffer and incubated for 60 minutes at 37°C. Pretreatment with the
ALDH1 inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde was used as a
negative control.
Detection of caspase activity
Kits providing fluorochrome inhibitors of caspases (FLICA)
were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Immunochemistry Technologies) and caspase activity
was analyzed by flow cytometry or immunofluorescence microscopy as described (6).
Protein isolation and Western blot analysis
Cell proteins were isolated and Western blot analysis was
done as described recently (6).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Whole-cell extract was harvested as described recently (24)
and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was done as
described (6).
Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry
Immunohistochemistry on 6-μm frozen or paraffinembedded tissue sections was done as described previously
(6). Antibodies used were rat anti-mouse CD31 monoclonal
antibody (mAb; PharMingen) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cleaved fragment of activated human caspase-3
(R&D Systems), human Ki-67 (Thermo Scientific), and human
ZEB1 (Santa Cruz). Mouse mAbs were anti-human Twist2,
anti-vimentin (Abcam), and anti–HIF-1α (BD Biosciences).
Statistical analyses
For MTT and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
measurements, data are presented as the mean ± SD. Data
were analyzed using Student's t test for statistical significance. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For
xenografts of nude mice, a distribution free test for tumor
growth curve analyses for therapy experiments was used as
described by Koziol and colleagues and Kallifatidis and
colleagues (25, 26).

Results
SO reduces CSC properties
We used MIA-PaCa2 and BxPc-3 pancreatic cancer cell
lines, which we have recently characterized as CSChigh and
CSClow, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Morphologically, CSClow cells consist of only one adherent cell phenotype, whereas CSC high cells contain adherent cells and
spheroidal floating cells (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether
SO targets pancreatic CSCs, both cell lines were treated with
2, 5, 10, 20, or 50 μmol/L SO, and 48 hours later, cell viability
was analyzed by MTT assay. SO treatment resulted in a dosedependent inhibition of viability in both cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A). However, SO at the highest concentration
of 50 μmol/L was toxic to nonmalignant primary human skin
fibroblasts and bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem/
stromal cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C). Therefore,
SO was applied at a subtoxic concentration of 20 μmol/L
in all further experiments. This concentration significantly
reduced colony and spheroid formation (Fig. 1B, compare
Fig. 3C). However, some small colonies survived, resulting
in regrowth of spheroids 30 days later (Fig. 1C). These data
indicate that SO alone does not completely diminish the
clonogenicity and self-renewal capacity of CSCs in vitro.
SO diminishes the growth of CSCs in vivo by inhibition
of proliferation and angiogenesis
To investigate the effects of SO in vivo, MIA-PaCa2 CSChigh
cells were s.c. transplanted into nude mice. Treatment with
SO at days 11, 12, and 13 after tumor inoculation strongly
inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A).
No toxic side effects of SO occurred as concluded from the
unchanged general condition of mice and constant body

weight during treatment (Fig. 2B and data not shown). In
xenograft tissue, obtained 17 days after treatment, SO reduced
the percentage of Ki-67–positive tumor cells in a dose-dependent
manner, suggesting inhibition of proliferation (Fig. 2C and D).
Likewise, blood vessel density was decreased by SO as examined by CD31 staining of endothelial cells. Accordingly, apoptosis was induced as concluded from enhanced activity of
caspase-3, which was, however, not significant. These data
show that SO retards the growth of pancreatic CSChigh xenografts by diminishing angiogenesis and proliferation and,
most likely, by induction of apoptosis. However, SO did not
completely eradicate the tumor mass, suggesting the need
for combination therapy to increase the effect.
SO and SF synergistically inhibit CSC
characteristics in vitro
For sensitization, we pretreated BxPc-3 CSChigh and MIAPaCa2 CSClow cells with SF for 24 hours followed by incubation with SO for an additional 48 hours. This resulted in a
more pronounced induction of cell death compared with
each substance alone as indicated by cell morphology
(Fig. 3A), colony and spheroid formation (Fig. 3B and C),

and ALDH1 positivity (Fig. 3D). Fluorogenic substrate assays
indicated that SF or SO single treatment activated caspase3/7, caspase-8, and caspase-9 only marginally, whereas the
combination strongly activated caspase-3/7, caspase-8, and
caspase-9 in both cell lines with an additive effect (Fig. 4A).
To investigate whether SF- and SO-induced apoptosis could
be abrogated by caspase inhibition, we preincubated cells
with pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK for 4 hours before
treatment (Fig. 4B). Z-VAD-FMK significantly decreased apoptosis in both cell lines as evaluated by Nicoletti staining
and detection of DNA fragmentation by FACS analysis. To
determine whether the expression of antiapoptotic proteins
was altered, we examined cIAP-1, XIAP, and cFLIP expression by Western blot. Generally, there was a difference in
basal expression of antiapoptotic proteins between the
two cell lines: Whereas cIAP, XIAP, and cFLIP were highly
expressed in CSChigh cells, only cIAP was highly expressed
in CSClow cells, which reflects the higher apoptosis sensitivity of this latter cell line (Fig. 4C). Correspondingly, the ef-

fects of SO and SF on expression of antiapoptotic proteins
were more pronounced in CSChigh cells because both SF and
SO reduced the expression of cIAP, XIAP, and cFLIP, whereas the effect was highest with the combination treatment.
In combined therapy, SF increases targeting of CSC characteristics by SO, involving colony and spheroid formation,
ALDH1 activity, and apoptosis resistance.
SF completely abolishes SO-induced NF-κB activity in
CSChigh cells
To investigate whether SO may sensitize pancreatic CSCs by
affecting NF-κB survival signaling, we performed gel retardation assays. Unexpectedly, we found a strong increase of DNA
binding induced by SO in both cell lines (Fig. 5A). Although SF
itself did not enhance promoter binding of NF-κB complexes,
it mediated a marked reduction of SO-induced NF-κB activity
in BxPc-3 CSClow cells and totally abolished it in MIA-PaCa2
CSChigh cells. To elucidate the transactivation activity, we
analyzed the composition of the SO-induced NF-κB complexes

was evaluated based on the density

by incubation of cell extracts with the NF-κB consensus
sequence in the presence of specific antibodies recognizing
the various NF-κB subunits (Fig. 5B). In both cell lines, a selective supershift of p65 (RelA) was observed, whereas p50 and
cRel could not be detected. In addition, RelB- and p52-specific
shifts did not occur (data not shown). To evaluate p65 (RelA)
activity by its phosphorylation pattern, we performed Western
blot analysis with antibodies recognizing total p65 and
phosphorylated p65. In line with the gel retardation assays,
treatment with SO, but not with SF, led to a stronger phosphorylation of p65 (Fig. 5C). Combination of SO and SF slightly
diminished phosphorylation of p65 in CSClow cells, but not in
CSChigh cells. These results indicate binding of a high amount
of transactivation-potent p65 (RelA)-containing NF-κB dimers
on treatment with SO. SF inhibits DNA binding but not the
phosphorylation pattern of p65. Because NF-κB activity is associated with increased cell migration, we investigated whether SO affects the cell motility of MIA-PaCa2 CSChigh cells.
Short-term scratch assays were performed under hypoxic conditions to enhance migratory activity. Compared with cells
cultured under normoxic conditions, hypoxia led to faster
migration of CSChigh cells into the wounded region (Fig. 5D).

SF, but not SO, strongly inhibited hypoxia-induced migration.
However, SO completely prevented the migratory potential on
coincubation with SF.
SF and SO synergistically inhibit the growth of
pancreatic CSC xenografts
To evaluate the in vivo effects of combined SF and SO treatment, we s.c. xenografted MIA-PaCa2 CSChigh cells into nude
mice. After treatment, tumor size and body weight of mice
were monitored daily. Treatment with SO or SF alone retarded
tumor growth, but combined SF and SO treatment was strongest and significantly reduced tumor growth (P < 0.05; Fig. 6A).
Importantly, there was neither a change in body weight of
mice (Fig. 6A, right) nor a significant elevation of plasma levels
of lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, or alanine aminotransferase (Supplementary Fig. S2A), suggesting
that the treatment was not toxic. To investigate the potential
mechanisms of tumor growth retardation, tissue samples
were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Double staining of
CD31 and active caspase-3–positive cells in xenograft samples indicated that tumor vascularity was reduced and apoptosis was induced on combined treatment with SO and SF

treated with SF (10 μmol/L, 96 h) or SO (20 μmol/L, 72 h). Seventy-two hours later, the activity of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3/7 was measured by
FLICA staining and analyzed by flow cytometry. One representative immunofluorescence image of active caspase-3/7 in CSClow cells that were
cotreated with SF + SO is shown. B, CSClow and CSChigh cells were either left untreated (white columns) or preincubated with Z-VAD-FMK (40 μmol/L) for

of β-actin served as a loading control.

(Fig. 6B). Furthermore, we observed a strong reduction of tumor cell proliferation after combined SF and SO treatment as
analyzed by Ki-67 immunostainings. Finally, we investigated
protein expression involved in epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), which has been associated with early signs

of metastasis following tumor hypoxia and NF-κB activity
(27, 28). First, SO, but not SF, strongly increased the expression
of HIF-1α, suggesting induction of hypoxia by SO. Combination with SF decreased the induction of hypoxia by SO (Fig. 6C).
Correspondingly, the EMT proteins Zeb-1 and Twist2 were

upregulated after SO treatment, whereas SF treatment
alone had no effect; however, their expression decreased
after cotreatment with SO and SF. Expression of vimentin,
a mesenchymal cell marker, was already upregulated in untreated CSChigh tumors and not further affected by SO. In contrast, SF alone or in combination with SO downregulated
vimentin expression. Taken together, these data suggest that
growth retardation of CSChigh tumor xenografts by combined
SF and SO treatment involves antiangiogenic, antiproliferative, and proapoptotic mechanisms. Moreover, SO-induced inhibition of angiogenesis may have been the reason for hypoxia
induction, which may be, together with SO-induced NF-κB activity, the reason for the observed enhanced expression of
proteins involved in EMT.

Discussion
Here, we show that the multikinase inhibitor SO alone diminishes pancreatic CSC-like tumor cells, but depletes them
significantly only in combination with the phytochemical SF.
The major CSC characteristics of the CSChigh MIA-PaCa2 and
CSClow BxPc-3 cell lines have been described in our recent
study (6). In the present work, we describe the presence of
two cell populations, which can be found in CSChigh but
not in CSClow cells, namely, spheroidal cells and fibroblastlike adherent cells. These two populations may correspond
to primitive CSCs and differentiated daughter cells, suggesting differentiation potential of in vitro cultured pancreatic
CSCs. SO targeted both cell subpopulations present in the

expression of whole p65 protein and

conditions. Migration was analyzed

apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, and downregulation of antiapoptotic proteins. In addition, SO strongly diminished clonogenicity, spheroid formation, and ALDH1 activity. Most
importantly, the concentration of 20 μmol/L SO was selectively toxic to CSCs but not to nonmalignant primary skin
fibroblasts and bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem/
stromal cells. This finding corresponds to our in vivo results
showing that treatment of mice harboring CSChigh xenografts

health, body weight, and liver parameters were constant during and after treatment. Reduction of pancreatic tumor xenografts was due to inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis
and induction of apoptosis. Our results confirm data obtained in thyroid carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma
xenograft models (29, 30), in which the authors describe inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth along with induction of apoptosis following treatment of the mice with SO.
We are the first to report increased NF-κB activity on SO
treatment. We found induction of p65 (RelA)-containing

supershift assays and detection of phosphorylated p65 proteins by Western blot analysis. This result was surprising because NF-κB activity may render tumor cells resistant to
conventional cancer therapy. However, many chemotherapeutic agents and the apoptosis-inducing ligand tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand share this unwanted
feature of SO and can activate NF-κB (6). Basal NF-κB overexpression is observed in various malignant tumors including
pancreatic adenocarcinoma and has been made responsible
for high therapy resistance of pancreatic tumor cells (31, 32).
We assume that enhanced NF-κB binding by SO could be the
reason for the observed selection of resistant CSChigh clones
on long-term treatment with SO. NF-κB was recently identified as a central mediator of EMT and metastasis in a model
of breast cancer (28). Our xenograft studies suggest that NF-κB
activity may be involved in induction of EMT following SO
treatment, resulting in the selection of a more invasive and
metastatic phenotype. Such a scenario has recently been described, as transcription factors involved in EMT are possible
downstream targets of NF-κB (33, 34).
To overcome SO-induced NF-κB activity and associated resistance, we chose SF for cotreatment because we recently
showed that this broccoli-derived isothiocyanate is able to
sensitize pancreatic CSCs toward conventional therapy by
strong downregulation of NF-κB activity (6). Indeed, SF totally abolished SO-induced NF-κB binding in CSChigh cells,
whereas no effect in CSClow cells was observed. SF may directly interfere with promoter binding of p65 (RelA), rather
than downregulating p65 phosphorylation, as we conclude
from our supershift assays and Western blot analysis of phosphorylated p65. Furthermore, combination of SO with SF
considerably reduced the clonogenicity and self-renewal potential of CSCs and enhanced apoptosis in vitro. In addition,
suppression of NF-κB sensitized CSCs to SO-induced apoptosis, as measured by caspase activity and DNA fragmentation.
Although we were not able to detect any NF-κB changes in
xenografts, this transcription factor may be involved in the
observed effects in tumors because several in vivo studies

show that blocking of NF-κB in pancreatic cancer affects
angiogenesis, apoptosis, and proliferation (35).
A notable recent observation by other authors is that SO and
related antiangiogenic substances induce pronounced initial
tumor growth retardation. However, this is followed by adaptation of the tumor to treatment and subsequent regrowth
(18, 19). Our results confirm this observation because a few
clones of our long-term treated CSChigh cells adapted to SO
treatment and survived. These results match our in vivo findings, where inhibition of angiogenesis by SO may have induced
hypoxia and EMT. Another potential mechanism explaining
the tumor regrowth in the presence of SO could be that after
transient vessel reduction induced by the antiangiogenic treatment, the delivery of therapeutic substances is impaired.
In conclusion, our data show that although SO is initially
effective, it does not lead to total elimination of CSCs, which
start to regrow after an interim. Combination with an NF-κB
inhibitor such as SF may be a therapeutic option to improve
the therapeutic effect of SO.
