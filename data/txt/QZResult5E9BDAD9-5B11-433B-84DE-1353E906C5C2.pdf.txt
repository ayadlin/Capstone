ABSTRACT
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play critical roles in apoptosis and contribute
to the proliferation of cancer cells. AR-42 is a novel Class I and II HDAC inhibitor
that shows cytotoxicity against various human cancer cell lines. The present study
aims to identify the target of AR-42 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as
evaluate its therapeutic efficacy. We found that HDAC5 was upregulated in HCC tissues
compared to adjacent normal tissues, and this was correlated with reduced patient
survival. CCK8 and colony-formation assays showed that HDAC5 overexpression
promotes proliferation in HCC cell lines. Treatment with AR-42 decreased HCC cell
growth and increased caspase-dependent apoptosis, and this was rescued by HDAC5
overexpression. We demonstrated that AR-42 can inhibit the deacetylation activity of
HDAC5 and its downstream targets in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results
demonstrate for the first time that AR-42 targets HDAC5 and induces apoptosis in
human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. AR-42 therefore shows potential as a new drug
candidate for HCC therapy.

INTRODUCTION

make up Class III [3]. Class I HDACs (1, 2, 3 and 8) and
Class II HDACs (4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10) play an important
role in tumorigenesis and may be candidate targets for
cancer treatment [4–8]. Numerous reports indicate HDACs
are overexpressed in many cancers (especially HDAC1,
HDAC2 and HDAC8 in colon cancer) and inhibit specific
tumor suppressor genes, resulting in an aberrant epigenetic
status compared to adjacent normal cells [9, 10]. HDAC5,
a Class II HDAC, has been shown to play a critical role in
cell proliferation and apoptosis in different cancers, and
HDAC5 expression is increased in liver cancer tissues
[11], suggesting that it may be a potential marker of
poor patient survival [12–14]. However, the molecular
mechanism of HDAC5 in human HCC remains unclear.

As resistance to conventional anti-cancer drugs
becomes increasingly commonplace, research aimed at
developing new strategies for treating hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) in the clinic, as well as identifying new
tumor markers, is urgently needed [1]. HCC is one of the
most common malignant cancers worldwide, causing more
than half a million deaths annually and ranking as the third
leading cause of cancer-related mortality [2].
The histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes
that catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from histones.
According to their homology and structure, the 11 HDACs
are divided into Classes I, II and IV, whereas the 7 sirtuins

Because acetylation-mediated epigenetic changes
are reversible, HDAC inhibitors show potential as
promising chemotherapeutic agents. Indeed, numerous
studies reported that HDAC inhibitors (Vorinostat
(Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid; SAHA), romidepsin,
entinostat and valproic acid) exhibit anti-tumor effects in
a variety of tumors in vitro and in vivo [15–17]. Vorinostat
and romidepsin have been approved by U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma [18]. AR-42, a novel hydroxamatetethered phenylbutyrate derivative, is a potent general
HDAC inhibitor with selective cytotoxicity in various
human tumor models [19–21]. Compared with other
HDAC inhibitors, AR-42 was more potent in inducing
apoptosis and suppressing tumor xenograft growth in
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell lines [19].
However, the effects of AR-42 in hepatocellular carcinoma
have not yet been studied.
In the present study, we confirmed high levels of
HDAC5 in tumor tissues, which suggested the poor
survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. In
addition, we found that high levels of HDAC5 induced
proliferation and inhibited apoptosis in HCC cell lines.
AR-42 inhibited cancer cell proliferation through the
induction of cell apoptosis primarily by targeting HDAC5.
These findings indicate that HDAC5 shows promise as a
potential therapeutic target and AR-42 may be a new drug
candidate for HCC therapy.

We evaluated the relationship between cell proliferation and
HDAC expression using a normal liver cell line (Chang’s)
and four human HCC cell lines (7721, Hep3B, Huh7
and HepG2). We found that only HDAC5 protein levels
positively correlated with cell proliferation (Figure 2B
and 2C). HDAC5 overexpression and knockdown in HCC
cell lines also confirmed this proliferation-promoting
effect (Figure 2D, 2E and 2F). Moreover, HDAC5
expression was significantly increased in HCC tissues
compared with adjacent normal tissues (Figure 2G).
We queried The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database,
which contains clinically annotated genomic data from
269 HCC samples [28, 29], and found that HDAC5 mRNA
was overexpressed (Z > 2) in 19/269 HCC cases (7%), and
was associated with reduced patient survival (P = 0.0132,
log-rank test) (Figure 2H).

AR-42 induced HepG2 cell apoptosis in vitro
We found that AR-42 increased cell death in a dosedependent manner in HCC cell lines, and, consistent
with previous studies, HDAC5 overexpression partially
reversed this effect (Figure 3A) [30]. Transfection of cells
with siHDAC5 significantly decreased colony formation
and partially blocked AR-42 inhibition of clonogenicity
(Figure 3B). Flow cytometry results demonstrated that
AR-42 increased the relative amount of cell apoptosis
while HDAC5 overexpression protected HepG2 cells
against this effect. Conversely, siHDAC5 increased
HepG2 cell apoptosis (Figure 3D). AR-42-induced
caspase substrate (polyADP ribose polymerase (PARP)
and caspase 3) cleavage was mildly reversed by HDAC5
overexpression, and was effectively abrogated by
siHDAC5 (Figure 3E and 3F). Collectively, these results
indicate that HDAC5 participates in AR-42-induced
apoptosis in HepG2 cells and that HDAC5 might be the
target of AR-42.

RESULTS
The inhibitory effect of AR-42 on HCC cell
viability
CCK8 assay results showed that the 50% growth
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of AR-42 at 48 h was
approximately 0.9 μM in 7721 cells, HepG2 cells and
Hep3B cells (Figure 1A). Consistent with CCK8 assays,
colony formation in HCC cells was significantly decreased
after AR-42 treatment (Figure 1B). Flow cytometry
confirmed that AR-42-induced cell death (Figure 1C) was
due to apoptosis (Figure 1D). Collectively, these results
revealed that AR-42 treatment reduced HCC cell viability.

HDAC5 is the direct target of AR-42
To determine whether AR-42 inhibited HDAC5
activity, HepG2 cells were treated with AR-42 following
transfection with HDAC5 overexpression vector. We found
that HDAC5 protein levels were unchanged by AR-42
treatment (Figure 4A). Inhibition of HDAC5 activity
by AR-42 was subsequently assessed by evaluating
acetylation of histone H3, the downstream target of
HDAC5 [31]. We found that AR-42 increased histone
H3 acetylation, and HDAC5 overexpression reversed
this effect (Figure 4B). These data suggested that AR-42
inhibits HDAC5 activity.
We then attempted to determine which HDAC was
responsible for AR-42-induced apoptosis (Figure 4C). To
elucidate the direct target of AR-42, we used an in vitro
deacetylation system. AR-42 treatment inhibited HDAC
2, 5 and 6 deacetylation activity, but had only a marginal
inhibitory effect on HDAC1 (Figure 4D). We investigated

HDAC5 overexpression promoted growth in
HCC cells
Certain HDACs (especially HDAC 1, 2, 5 and 6) are
upregulated in cancer cells and this correlates with reduced
survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [12–14,
22–26]. In some of the same studies, the expression of
other HDACs (especially HDAC 4, 9, 10 and 11) did
not differ between HCC and noncancerous liver tissue
[22, 27]. When we assessed the impacts of HDACs
1–7 on HepG2 cell proliferation, we found that only
HDAC5 significantly promoted proliferation (Figure 2A).

significantly inhibited tumor growth (Figure 5A and 5C).
The body weights of treated mice were used as indicators
of health [33]. AR-42 treatment did not affect mouse
body weight, indicating that the mice did not experience
evident toxicity in vivo (Figure 5B). An assessment of
activity in HDACs extracted from HepG2 xenograft
samples confirmed the inhibitory effect of AR-42 in vivo
(Figure 5C). Furthermore, histological sections of xenograft
samples were stained with TUNEL and Ki-67, markers

Consistent with the in vitro results, AR-42 administration
increased TUNEL staining and reduced Ki-67
staining in xenograft tissues, confirming the anti-tumor
effect of AR-42 (Figure 5E and 5F).
HDAC5 phosphorylation liberates nuclear
transcription factors through nuclear export of the

phosphorylated HDAC5 [34]. We found that HDAC5
mainly localized to the nucleus, but was also observed
in the cytoplasm. AR-42 treatment did not significantly
change the location and protein level of HDAC5 in HepG2
xenograft samples (Figure 5G). These data collectively
demonstrated the apoptosis-inducing and proliferationinhibiting activity of AR-42 in vivo.

DISCUSSION

HDACs (especially HDACs 1, 2, 5 and 6) are upregulated
in cancer cells compared to normal tissue [12–14, 22–26].
The expression of HDAC isoenzymes correlates with
clinicopathological factors, suggesting that these HDACs
may be potential indicators of reduced patient survival.
However, modifications in HDAC expression (especially
HDACs 1, 3, 7 and 8) did not affect HCC cell proliferation
[23, 35]. Since HDACs 1, 2, 5 and 6 were differentially
expressed and correlate with clinicopathological factors

HDACs are promising targets for anti-tumor
therapeutics, as Class I and II HDACs play important roles
in tumorigenesis [4–8]. Numerous reports indicate that
HDACs are overexpressed in many cancers and inhibit
specific tumor suppressor genes, resulting in aberrant
epigenetics in cancer cells compared to adjacent normal
tissue [9, 10]. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), some

in HCC, we screened the effects of these HDACs on
HCC cells proliferation and confirmed that HDAC5
enhances cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis,
indicating that HDAC5 could be the potential target of the
chemotherapeutic, AR-42. As AR-42 is a broad HDAC
inhibitor, its inhibitory effects on other HDACs besides
HDAC5 could not be ignored. Therefore, we evaluated
the inhibitory effect of AR-42 to HDACs 1, 2, 5 and 6
by employing mass spectrometry and confirmed AR-42
could directly inhibit HDACs 2, 5 and 6 in vitro. At
the molecular level, HDAC5 overexpression not only
partially reversed the AR-42 induced cell apoptosis, but
also reversed the AR-42 induced protein increase of p53
and apoptosis-related proteins, while HDAC2 and HDAC6
did not show a similar effect . Consistent with in vitro
data, AR-42 significantly inhibited the in vivo activity
of HDAC5, and induced apoptosis in HepG2 xenograft
tissues. Together, these data suggest that AR-42 induces
HCC cell apoptosis by inhibiting the activity of HDAC5.
HDAC5 can cause significant modifications in
heterochromatin structure that trigger cancer cells to
undergo apoptosis [11]. HDAC5 is also regulated by posttranslational modification: phosphorylation of HDAC5
by HDAC5 kinases liberates nuclear transcription
factors through nuclear export of the phosphorylated
HDAC5 [34]. The exit of HDAC5 from the nucleus

after prolonged genotoxic stress coincides with TIP60dependent acetylation of p53 at K120 and recruitment
of p53 to the BAX proapoptotic target gene promoter,
and with the expression of the proapoptotic target gene
[36]. We found that AR-42 treatment did not significantly
change the cellular location or protein level of HDAC5 in
HepG2 xenograft samples, indicating that AR-42 inhibits
the deacetylation activity of HDAC5, rather than its
expression.
Acetylation increases p53 protein stability and
upon acetylation of p53 at K120, p53 preferentially
activates the expression of proapoptotic genes BAX,
PUMA, DR5 and NOXA [36]. We evaluated the role of
P53 in AR-42-induced apoptosis and found that AR-42
significantly increased protein levels of P53 and activated
the expression of the downstream proapoptotic gene
PUMA. HDAC5 overexpression not only rescued AR-42induced cell apoptosis, but also reversed AR-42-induced
upregulation of p53 and PUMA in HepG2 cells. However,
we observed the same results in Hep3B without p53,
which indicated that AR-42 promotes HCC cell apoptosis
partially by increasing HDAC5 acetylation of p53.
The present work found that HDAC5, a key
regulatory factor for cell proliferation and apoptosis, was
associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. For the
first time, our results demonstrated that AR-42 induces cell

(CST). LC3, P53, PUMA, HA, and anti-histone H3
antibodies were kindly provided by the Zhao lab of Fudan
University (Shanghai, China).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Human liver cell lines (HepG2, Huh-7, Hep3B, 7721
and Chang’s) and HEK293 were gifts from the Institute
of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes
for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China) and the Zhao lab of Fudan University
(Shanghai, China) [37, 38]. Cells were maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (Invitrogen)
(100 U/ml) and streptomycin (Invitrogen) (100 U/ml).
AR-42 (Selleck, Houston, TX, USA) and the HDAC Assay
Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) were commercially
purchased.

Cell viability and clonogenic assay
Cels viability was determined using the CCK-8
colorimetric assay in 96-well plates (2 × 103 cells/well)
(Dijindo, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan). The absorbance at
450 nm was recorded using a micro-plate reader. For the
clonogenic assay, cells were seeded into 6-well plates
(5 × 102 cells/well) and cultured for 10 days. Colonies
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal
violet, and then counted.

Patient samples
Liver cancer samples were acquired from the
Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, The Eastern
Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital of Second Military
Medical University. The use of all patient samples in
this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The
Second Military Medical University.

Apoptosis assay
Cell apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry
using the AnnexinV-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection
Kit (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunohistochemistry

HDAC deacetylation assay

Tumor specimens were fixed in 4% formalin and
embedded in paraffin. The sections were incubated with
TUNEL kit buffer (Gugebio, Wuhan, China) or antiKi67 antibodies (Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) and
subsequently with DAPI (Gugebio) and the corresponding
secondary antibody (Zsbio, Beijing, China). Sections were
then treated with immunoperoxidase using the DAB kit
(Zsbio) and scored [39].

Cells were lysed in NP-40 buffer containing
50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (Sigma, St Louis, MO,
USA), 150 mM NaCl (Sangon, Shanghai, China), 0.5%
Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 1 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma),
1 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 1 μg/ml pepstatin (Sigma),
1 mM Na3VO4 (Sigma) and 1 mM PMSF (Sigma). For
immunoprecipitation, 500 μl of cell lysate was incubated
with HA antibody (provided by the Zhao lab of Fudan
University) for three hours at 4°C with rotation. Then, 30 μl
Protein A Agarose (Millipore) was added for 12 hours
at 4°C with rotation, and the beads were washed three
times with lysis buffer before proteins were dissolved in
loading buffer. Deacetylation assays were carried out in
the presence of 5 μg enzyme and 0.3 μg peptide in 30 μl
reaction buffer (30 mM HEPES (Sigma), 0.6 mM MgCl2
(Sangon), 1 mM DTT (Sigma), 1 mM NAD+ (Sigma),
10 mM PMSF (Sigma)). The deacetylation reaction was
incubated for 3–5 hours at 37°C before the mixture was
desalted by passing it through a C18 ZipTip (Millipore).
The desalted samples were analyzed using a MALDITOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Grand
Island, NY, USA). The acetylated peptide used in the assay
was GILRRLKKAcYDNCWL (Glssale, Shanghai, China).

Cell transfection
Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The siRNAs were commercially purchased (Santa Cruz)
[11]. The control vector and HDAC1-7 expression vectors
were kindly provided by the Zhao lab of Fudan University
(Shanghai, China).

Western blotting analysis
Cells were lysed with 0.5% NP40 lysis buffer and
proteins were blotted following standard protocol. Signals
were probed using the chemiluminescence ECL plus
reagent (Thermo, Grand Island, NY, USA) and detected
