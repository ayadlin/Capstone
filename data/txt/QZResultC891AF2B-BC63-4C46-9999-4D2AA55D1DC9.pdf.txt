BACKGROUND. Lipoplatin is a new liposomal cisplatin that already has been
tested in solid tumors, with encouraging results. The purpose of the current
study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of a 21-day regimen of lipoplatin plus a fixed dose of gemcitabine in patients with refractory or resistant nonsmall cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2.

METHODS. The lipoplatin dose was escalated at 100 mg/m2 by increments of
10 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8, with gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 administered
on Days 1 and 8, repeated every 21 days. Hematopoietic growth factors were not
allowed. Thirteen patients with advanced stage NSCLC who had been pretreated

RESULTS. At the fourth dose level, the DLT was reached (grade 3 neutropenia
fourth patient demonstrated degradation of performance status). Therefore, the
third dose level (lipoplatin at a dose of 120 mg/m2) was defined as the MTD. At
the same dose level, 2 of 4 patients had grade 3 thrombocytopenia. At the fourth
dose level, 1 patient achieved a partial response and 1 patient had stable disease.
Another patient achieved stable disease at the second dose level. Therefore, the
overall disease control rate was 23% (3 of 13 patients). The median overall survival was 29 weeks (range, 4 weeks-59 weeks) and the median time to disease
progression was 12 weeks (range, 3 weeks-36 weeks).

CONCLUSIONS. The pharmacokinetic profile of the 2 compounds used in the current study are not modified when they are administered according to the schedule evaluated in this trial. When one considers that the patients in the current
study had refractory or resistant NSCLC, the authors concluded that the combination of lipoplatin administered at a dose of 120 mg/m2 and gemcitabine administered at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks needs to be
studied further in phase 2 trials. Cancer 2008;113:2752–60.  2008 American

ung cancer remains the most common fatal malignancy. Despite
more aggressive therapies, only a slight improvement in survival
has been obtained during the last several decades.1 Patients with
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) account for approximately 75%
of cases, with the majority found to have locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.2

Phase 1 Lipoplatin/Gemcitabine in NSCLC/Froudarakis et al

Although chemotherapy appears to have little
impact on the survival of patients with advanced or
metastatic NSCLC,3 it has been proven to be beneficial in controlling cancer-related symptoms and
improving quality of life.4 Cisplatin-containing chemotherapy generally offers a superior survival benefit
compared with noncisplatin-containing combinations of older3 or newer5 generation agents in
advanced NSCLC. A major cause of tumor recurrence
in patients with NSCLC who are receiving chemotherapy is the development of tumor cell resistance
to platinum compounds.6 In addition, the efficacy of
platinum-based regimens is often limited by renal
and hematologic toxicities, which leads to chemotherapy interruption.7
Lipoplatin (Regulon Inc, Mountain View, Calif )
is a liposomal formulation of cisplatin that was
developed to reduce the systemic toxicity of cisplatin while simultaneously improving the efficacy of
the drug in tumor cells.8 Lipoplatin is able to deliver
the drug in a nanoparticle form that evades immune
surveillance and extravasates preferentially through
the leaky vasculature that is characteristic of tumor
cells with intense neoangiogenesis. It consists of
liposome particles of an average size of 110 nanometers with a lipid-to-cisplatin ratio of 10 mg:24 mg.
The fusogenic anionic lipid dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) on its surface is supposed to
promote fusion between the lipid bilayer of the
liposome and the cell membrane. In addition, the
nanoparticle nature of the drug results in a higher
uptake believed to arise from a more avid phagocytosis of lipoplatin particles by tumor cells compared
with normal cells.9 Studies of lipoplatin have
demonstrated a low toxicity profile, an ability to
concentrate in tumors and to escape immune cells
and macrophages, a slow clearance rate from the
kidneys, long circulation properties in body fluids, a
half-life of 36 hours in the blood, and promising
therapeutic efficacy.10
Gemcitabine (Gemzar; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis,
Ind), a nucleoside analogue, is administered in combination with cisplatin as the first-line treatment of
patients with inoperable, locally advanced, or metastatic NSCLC.11 The main adverse reaction is myelotoxicity. The advantage of using combinations of
gemcitabine with cisplatin has been reported to be
the inhibition of the DNA synthetic pathways
involved in the repair of platinum-DNA adducts.12,13
We performed a phase 1 trial14 to determine the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT) of the combination of lipoplatin and
gemcitabine in patients with advanced NSCLC that
was refractory or resistant to cisplatin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Inclusion
Between July 2004 and September 2006, 13 patients
with histologically proven, recurrent or refractory,
advanced NSCLC were included in the study (Table 1).
Inclusion criteria were the presence of measurable or
evaluable disease; =2 previous chemotherapy regimens with at least 1 containing a platinum compound; prior chemotherapy that ended at least 4
weeks previously; age 18 years; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
2; adequate bone marrow reserve (neutrophil count
1500mm-3 and a platelet count 120,000mm-3); adequate renal and hepatic function; absent or stable
brain metastases; and an estimated life expectancy
12 weeks. The protocol was registered at the Hellenic
National Drug Administration, and was approved by
the Ethics Committee of both the University Hospital
of Alexandroupolis and Crete Interclinic Hospital of
Heraklion. All patients provided written informed consent before their inclusion in the study.
Treatment and Dose Escalation
Gemcitabine was administered first at a fixed dose of
1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 through intravenous

infusion in 250 mL of normal saline over 30 minutes.
Lipoplatin was administered on Days 1 and 8
through intravenous infusion in 500 mL of dextrose
over 4 hours after the administration of gemcitabine.
The starting dose of lipoplatin was 100 mg/m2, with
escalation in 10-mg/m2 increments. The treatment
was administered every 3 weeks up to a maximum of
6 cycles. Patients who had been treated with prior
chemotherapy containing gemcitabine were excluded
from the study.
Doses were escalated in successive groups of
patients according to a modified Fibonacci scheme.
At least 3 patients had to be treated at each dose
level and 3 cycles had to be administered per patient;
no intrapatient dose escalation was allowed. In the
case of grade 3/4 toxicity occurring in a patient
within a cohort, 1 additional patient would be
recruited if the toxicity affected the chemotherapy
schedule and/or the patient’s performance status. If
a grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in at
least 2 of the 3 patients within the same cohort, the
dose level was considered to be the DLT. The dose
level immediately before the DLT was defined as the
MTD. The treatments were administered on an inpatient basis. All patients received prophylactic antiemetic treatment with steroids and anti-5-HT3.
Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin were not used.15,16
Gemcitabine was purchased as a lyophilized
powder in 200-mg and 1000-mg vials and stored at
room temperature. It was reconstituted with normal
saline to yield 40 mg/mL. Lipoplatin was supplied by
Regulon as solution of 50 mL in clear glass vials
containing 150 mg of compound (concentration of
3 mg/mL), and stored at a temperature of 48C in
light-protected packages.

Treatment and Toxicity Evaluation
Disease evaluation was performed at baseline and
every 3 cycles or as required to confirm clinical suspicion of disease progression. Chest x-ray and computed tomography scans of the chest, brain, and
upper abdomen were used for tumor assessment.
Bone scan was performed only after there was a clinical suspicion of bone metastases. Stage of disease
was determined according to the Mountain classification.2 Before each cycle, the patient’s history,
results of a physical examination, and ECOG performance status were noted. Routine laboratory tests
were performed on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.
Assessment of toxicity and response was performed according to the World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria.17 DLT was defined as the occurrence
of any grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, except

emesis, in 3 patients at any dose level. Myelosuppressive DLT was also defined in relation to 3
patients at any dose level: neutropenia with a neutrophil count of 500 mm-3 lasting >7 days or a
neutrophil count 1000 mm-3 with fever (temperature of 388C) lasting >3 days, thrombocytopenia
25,000mm-3, or grade 3 neutropenia associated
with infection that required hospitalization. The
occurrence of a DLT led to either removal from the
study of involved patients or dose reduction to a
lower level, according to the judgment of the treating
physician.

Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples into tubes treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were taken at baseline and
before the administration of gemcitabine and then at
0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, and 192 hours after
the initiation of the lipoplatin infusion. Tubes were
centrifuged at 48C at 3000 cycles/minute for 5 minutes and the plasma was separated and stored at
2208C until determination.
Total plasma was analyzed for platinum. Total
platinum concentrations were determined in plasma
using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GF-AAS) assay. Standard solutions were
prepared by the dilution of platinum with water. A
solution of Triton X-100 (1 mL/L) and nitric acid
(0.02 g/L) was used as the matrix modifier.10 The linear range of the assay in plasma was 0.02 to 0.26 lg
Pt/mL, and the limit of detection did not exceed
12 ng Pt/mL. Further details of the furnace program
were as follows: wavelength of 265.9 nanometers
(nm); slit width (in nm) of 0.2 low; read time of 4
seconds; injected sample volume of 20 lL; and a furnace temperature escalation program of 6 steps
(908C, 1008C, 3008C, 4508C, 14008C, and 26508C).
Estimates of pharmacokinetic parameters were
obtained by noncompartmental analysis, based on
statistical moment theory. These parameters were
determined by a numeric integration procedure such
as the trapezoidal rule, which was used to determine
the plasma concentration time curve (area under the
curve [AUC]).18 The mean residence time (MRT) was
calculated from the equation MRT 5 AUMC/AUC, in
which AUMC is the area under the first moment
curve and MRT represents the time for 63.2% of the
administered dose to be eliminated. 1/Kelim (elimination rate constant) is the MRT, the statistical moment
analogue to half-life t1/2. The t1/2 (elimination halflife), the total body clearance (Cl), and the volume of
distribution at the steady state (Vss) were calculated
using standard equations such as for t1/2 5 0.693 (1/
Kel), and (infused dose 3 AUMC/AUC2)-(infused

dose 3 T/[23AUC]) for Vss, in which T is the infusion time.18
Pharmacokinetic analysis of gemcitabine was
performed for the 3 patients in the first cycle on Day
1 of the therapy at the MTD, according to the protocol, to determine whether any interaction between
the 2 drugs occurred. Blood samples were drawn
into tubes containing tetrahydrouridine before gemcitabine infusion and then at 30 minutes and 45
minutes and at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours thereafter.
Samples were immediately centrifuged at 48C at
3000 g for 5 minutes and plasma was separated and
stored at 2808C until analysis. Gemcitabine concentrations were measured by a reverse-phase liquid
chromatography method as described previously.19
Gemcitabine standard solutions were used to calculate standard calibration curves over the analytical
range of 20 to 0.1 lg/mL, with good linearity (correlation coefficient [r2] 0.9996). The detection limit
was determined to be 0.078 lg/mL plasma.

Statistical Analysis
The Student t test was used for analysis of the distribution of the observed frequencies. A P value .05
was considered to be statistically significant in the
mean values. Time to treatment failure and median
survival time were calculated according to the
Kaplan-Meier product-limit method with death from

cancer as the outcome.20 Statistical evaluation of the
data was performed using StatView 4.5 software (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley Calif).

RESULTS
Toxicity
Thirteen patients were evaluable for toxicity and tumor response (Table 1) (3 patients each for dose
levels 1, 2, and 3 and 4 patients for dose level 4).
One patient achieved dose level 4 and thus another
patient was enrolled. Two patients died during the
study because of disease progression, 1 at dose level
1 and another at dose level 4. A total of 74 courses
(median of 6 courses; range, 3 courses-12 courses)
were administered to the 13 evaluable patients (Table
2). The median numbers of cycles was 3. The administered dose intensity of each drug is shown in Table 2. At dose level 4 (130 mg/m2), 3 chemotherapy
courses were delayed for only 1 week because of toxicity (Table 2). At dose level 4, myelo-DLT was
achieved in 3 patients. Therefore, the MTD was
defined as dose level 3 (120 mg/m2).
Tables 3 and 4 show the main hematologic and
nonhematologic side effects by dose level in evaluable
patients. At dose level 1 (100 mg/m2), 1 patient
demonstrated grade 3 anemia (6.2% of the dose level
1 courses) and neutropenia (6.2% of the dose level 1
courses). At dose level 2 (110 mg/m2), 1 patient had

grade 3 neutropenia (5.5% of the dose level 2 courses).
Neutropenia was noted at Day 15; a white blood cell
count was performed on an ambulatory basis, and the
patient recovered spontaneously. At dose level 3 (120
mg/m2), 1 patient developed grade 3 anemia (5.5% of
the dose level 3 courses), without any impact on the
treatment schedule noted. Both patients (1 at dose
level 1 and 1 at dose level 3) had already presented
with grade 2 anemia with an ECOG performance status of 2 prior to inclusion in the study.
At dose level 4 (130 mg/m2), the first patient
who was enrolled experienced nonmyelo-DLT with
significant vomiting and asthenia that affected his
performance status, necessitating hospitalization.
According to the protocol, another patient was
recruited. A DLT was experienced at this level,
because 3 of 4 patients required >1 week for bone
marrow recovery (Table 3). Grade 3/4 neutropenia
occurred in 13.6% and thrombocytopenia was
reported in 22.7% of the 22 performed courses. Aplasia-related fever was not reported to occur in any
patient. In addition, grade 4 thrombocytopenia did
not occur in any patient.
The most frequent nonhematologic side effect
reported at any dose level was a flu-like syndrome
experienced by 8 patients (61.5%) that was grade 3/4
in 12.1% of the total courses. However, this flu-like
syndrome always resolved spontaneously without
affecting the patients’ performance status and/or the
treatment schedule. Grade 3/4 nausea and vomiting
was reported in 13.6% of the courses administered at
dose level 4. The patient with grade 4 vomiting at
dose level 4 also experienced fatigue and anorexia,
both of which were grade 4, which led to dehydration and necessitated hospitalization. One patient
developed grade 4 neurotoxicity at dose level 4, but
she had already had a grade 2 toxicity before inclusion in the study that was the result of previous cisplatin treatment. Mild renal toxicity (grade 1) was
noted in 3 patients at dose level 3. Other rare side

effects were epigastric pain in 1 patient at dose level
1, which resolved spontaneously, and cardiac arrhythmia necessitating the administration of amiodarone.
Neither toxicity affected the treatment schedules. Elevated bilirubin levels associated with transaminase
levels were noted in the 2 patients who died during
the study. Those levels were more likely to be elevated because of disease progression of the patients’
hepatic metastases than because of the chemotherapy itself. No deaths due to toxicity were reported.

Response
At dose level 4, 1 patient (7.7%) demonstrated a partial response, and a second achieved stable disease.
Another patient demonstrated stable disease at dose
level 2. Therefore, the overall response rate was 7.7%
and the disease control rate (DCR) was 23% (3 of 13
patients).
One female patient was still alive at the time of
last follow-up, although she did develop disease progression. The median overall survival was 29 weeks
(range, 4 weeks-59 weeks). The Kaplan-Meier overall
survival curve is shown in Figure 1. The median survival of responders was 48 weeks (range, 47 weeks-52
weeks), whereas that of nonresponders was 16 weeks
(range, 4 weeks-59 weeks). This difference was statistically significant (P 5 .01).
Overall, the median time to disease progression
was 12 weeks (range, 3 weeks-36 weeks). The median
time to disease progression in responders was 24
weeks (range, 23 weeks-36 weeks), whereas that of
nonresponders was 12 weeks (range, 3 weeks-24
weeks). This difference was statistically significant
(P 5 .01).
Pharmacokinetics

During the 4-hour infusion period, the maximum
platinum level in the plasma is attained at 4 hours at
doses of 100 mg/m2, 110 mg/m2, and 120 mg/m2
and declines thereafter. The infusion of lipoplatin at
a dose of 130 mg/m2 resulted in maximal levels of
platinum in the plasma at 8 hours. Differences in the
plasma levels of platinum at the different administered doses were registered; a maximum of 4.2 lg/
mL was attained in the plasma 4 hours after an
infusion of 100 mg/m2of lipoplatin, a maximum of
5.6 lg/mL was attained in the plasma 4 hours after
an infusion of 110 mg/m2 of lipoplatin, a maximum
of 6.6 lg/mL was attained in the plasma 4 hours after an infusion of 120 mg/m2 of lipoplatin, and a
maximum of 7.2 lg/mL was attained in the plasma
8 hours after an infusion of 130 mg/m2 of lipoplatin
(Table 5).
The plasma levels of platinum after lipoplatin
infusion are reported to drop to normal levels after

the fifth day for all doses except for dose level 1
(100 mg/m2), whereas plasma levels drop after 24 hours
(Fig. 3). The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for
total platinum calculated for each dose level are
shown in Table 5. At the MTD (120 mg/m2), the AUC

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge the current study is the first trial
of lipoplatin in combination with gemcitabine in
patients with advanced NSCLC. The results of the
current phase 1 study demonstrate the feasibility of
this new 2-drug combination (lipoplatin and gemcitabine) for patients with advanced NSCLC. Furthermore, all patients in the current study had received
previous treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The MTD of lipoplatin, administered as a 4-hour
infusion in this combination, was determined to be
120 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8. In this combination,
we administered gemcitabine at a fixed dose of 1000
mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 during a conventional 30minute infusion before lipoplatin, and the pharmacokinetic profiles of lipoplatin and gemcitabine were
not modified, as shown in previous reports in which
patients received the same or proportional doses of
gemcitabine in association with a diaminocyclohexane carrier platinum.19,21 In addition, the results of
the current study demonstrate that the combination
of gemcitabine and lipoplatin is well-tolerated, even
by patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated
previously with platinum-based chemotherapy.
The low toxicity noted was not surprising in view
of the nonoverlapping side effects of the 2 drugs. The
good tolerance of the regimen is especially important
in view of the characteristics of the patients in the current study, such as a median age of 63 years, an ECOG
performance status of 2 in 6 patients (46.1%), and
patients who were previously treated with platinumbased chemotherapy. Only in dose level 4 were significant grade 3 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia
noted in 22.7% and 13.6%, respectively, of the courses.
Moreover, there were no reported cases of febrile neutropenia, even at dose level 4. Only 1 of the 13 evaluable patients in the current study presented with

significant vomiting and asthenia that necessitated
hospital admission, also at dose level 4. It is interesting to note that in this phase 1 study of lipoplatin
administered as a single agent on Days 1 and 15, the
DLT was not reached because no significant toxicity
was observed.10 In a phase 1 study in patients with refractory pancreatic carcinoma, the MTD of lipoplatin
was reported to be 100 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 15, also
in combination with a fixed dose of gemcitabine (1000
mg/m2) administered on Days 1 and 15 in a 4-week
regimen. In this study, the DLT was reached at a dose
of 130 mg/m2, and toxicity was also mild.22 In general,
it appears that the combination of lipoplatin and gemcitabine demonstrates lower hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities compared with the toxicity of
classic combinations of platinum and gemcitabine23
or compared with a regimen of diaminocyclohexane
carrier platinum and gemcitabine.19,21,24
Allergic reactions, such as skin rash, fever, or flulike syndrome, are normal toxicities in patients
undergoing chemotherapy with liposoluble compounds. Overall, we observed these common toxicities in 8 patients (61.5%) at least once and with
differing grades of allergic reaction. Nevertheless,
these reactions were not clinically significant, and
were mostly well tolerated, as was expected. The
same percentage of patients (9 of 15 patients; 60%)
presented those manifestations in a recent phase 1
study of the combination of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine in a patient population similar to that in the
current study.24
Patients receiving treatment with platinum compounds classically develop peripheral sensory neurotoxicity. The incidence of neurotoxicity is attributable
to the cumulative platinum dose. Only 1 patient in
the current study presented with neurotoxicity at a
DLT level. Nevertheless, this patient had already had
grade 2 peripheral neurotoxicity at the time of inclusion into the study. This is even more important,
considering that all patients were previously treated
with some form of platinum combination chemotherapy. It has been reported that, with the use of
diaminocyclohexane carrier platinum compounds,
nearly all patients with cumulative dose levels of 540
mg/m2 express some degree of peripheral neurosensory toxicity.25 However, this neurotoxicity is reported
to be reversible because 82% of patients have their
neuropathy regress within 4 to 6 months, and 41%
experience a complete recovery within 6 to 8 months.
When lipoplatin was studied as a single agent in a
phase 1 trial, no patient demonstrated any sensory
neurotoxicity to a platinum dose of 250 mg/m2
per cycle,10 and when lipoplatin was administered in combination with gemcitabine, only 3

Phase 1 Lipoplatin/Gemcitabine in NSCLC/Froudarakis et al

patients demonstrated grade 1 peripheral neurotoxicity.22 Recent reports studying oxaliplatin also
reported mild peripheral neurotoxicity. However, this
finding was attributable to the relatively low cumulative dose of oxaliplatin administered.19,21 In the current study, the mean cumulative dose of lipoplatin
was 569 mg/m2, which is not low enough to explain
the low incidence of peripheral sensory neurotoxicity
noted.
Another issue in the use of chemotherapy with
cisplatin is the occurrence of renal toxicity, leading to
further treatment limitations.26 Nephrotoxicity after
cisplatin treatment is common and may manifest after a single dose with acute renal failure or may present with a chronic syndrome of renal electrolyte
wasting.27 Despite various hydration protocols
designed to minimize the nephrotoxicity, approximately one-third of patients who receive cisplatin develop evidence of acute renal failure.28 Cisplatin
accumulates in all nephron cells, but especially in the
proximal kidney tubule cells within the S3 segment,
which bear the brunt of the damage.27 We did not
observe any case of nephrotoxicity in the patients in
the current study, although they had been previously
treated with platinum compounds. This observation
is common in patients undergoing chemotherapy
with liposoluble platinum compounds. Indeed, lower
levels of total platinum have been observed in the kidneys after liposoluble platinum infusion, compared
with after cisplatin.29 It appears that the lipid capsule
offers protection in the kidney cells by rendering the
drug active inside the tumor cell, in which its cytotoxic effect is needed.29
Patients with advanced stage NSCLC who have
developed disease recurrence or progression while
receiving platinum-based chemotherapy are less
likely to respond to second-line regimens. The combination of lipoplatin and gemcitabine used in the
current study had a DCR of 23%, with a median time
to disease progression of 12 weeks (3 months) and
an overall survival of 29 weeks (7.1 months). The median duration of response was 24 weeks (6 months).
Although response and survival were not the primary
endpoints in the current study, our findings are consistent with those of other studies reporting the activity of some platinum compounds in cisplatinresistant tumors.21,24-26,30 Furthermore, these findings
suggest that, when combined with active agents not
used in first-line therapy, lipoplatin may provide a
useful alternative in patients with platinum-resistant
NSCLC.
The results of the current study suggest that lipoplatin at a dose of 120 mg/m2 combined with gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 of a

2759

21-day cycle is feasible, characterized by moderate
toxicity and few cycle delays, in a population of
NSCLC patients who received previous treatment
with a platinum compound. To the best of our
knowledge, the current study is the first dose escalation and pharmacokinetic study reported for the
combination of lipoplatin and gemcitabine in this
patient population. Based on the excellent tolerability
observed, this regimen deserves further testing in
phase 2 trials in patients with advanced NSCLC.
