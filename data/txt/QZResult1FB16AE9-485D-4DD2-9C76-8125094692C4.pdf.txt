ABSTRACT
Eg5 is a kinesin spindle protein that controls chromosomal segregation in mitosis
and is thus a critical drug target for cancer therapy. We report the discovery of a
potent, selective inhibitor of Eg5 designated YL001. YL001 was obtained through
shape similarity based virtual screening, and it bears a 1,5-disubstituted tetrazole
scaffold. YL001 exhibits favorable bioactivity in a variety of cancer cell lines, including
taxol-resistant ovarian cancer and 6TG-resistant breast cancer cell lines. This
compound inhibits tumor growth by 60% and significantly prolongs median survival
time by more than 50% in a xenograft mouse model. YL001 blocks the ATPase activity
of Eg5 and causes mitotic failure, ultimately resulting in apoptosis of cancer cells
through activation of the caspase-3 pathway. Our findings demonstrate that YL001
is a potent antitumor agent that may be developed for cancer therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

anti-proliferative effect as well as an anti-angiogenesis
effect [5]. Loop L5 of Eg5 is considered to be an important
component of the druggable Eg5 allosteric pocket.
Among kinesin spindle protein family members this loop
is the greatest in length, and thus better accommodates
small molecule modulators, therefore providing an ideal
structural basis for Eg5 inhibitor specificity [6, 7].
Numerous Eg5 inhibitors have been designed to
target this allosteric pocket, and agents are currently
undergoing clinical trials [8–15]. ARRY-520, developed
by Array BioPharma, is at the forefront of Eg5 inhibitor
research and development. The phase III clinical trial of
this compound was successfully completed in August,
2015 (data from Thomson Reuters CortellisTM). Another
promising Eg5 inhibitor candidate 4SC-205 which is
ongoing under Phase I trial can be administrated orally for
the treatment of solid tumor and hematologic neoplasia
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01065025). Neoplasm
was stabilized in 67% of patients for 100 days with

The kinesin spindle protein Eg5 (also known as
KSP or KIF11) is an important drug target in antimitotic
cancer therapy. In early stages of mitosis, Eg5 contributes
to centrosome separation through regulation of spindle
elongation, which is essential for the formation of the
bipolar spindle and segregation of sister chromatids [1, 2].
Successful blockage of Eg5 induces a hallmark phenotype
known as the monopolar spindle, and results in cellular
mitotic arrest and apoptosis [2, 3]. Overexpression of Eg5
leads to significant instability of the genome in mouse
models and carcinogenesis [4]. The generally negligible
expression of Eg5 in non-proliferating adult tissues results
in a lower toxicity profile of Eg5-targeted therapy as
compared to traditional anti-mitotic therapies. As Eg5 is
strongly expressed in specific tissues such as blood and
lymphatic vascular endothelial cells and is responsible for
tumor angiogenesis, inhibition of Eg5 may have both an

this agent, and median survival time was prolonged. In
multiple clinical studies, Eg5 inhibitor treatment has
shown favorable characteristics such as high tolerance,
good pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties
and low CNS toxicity [14, 16–18]. At the same time,
other Eg5 inhibitor scaffolds such as S-trityl-L-cysteine
(STLC) and its analogues [19, 20], benzimidazoles [21],
thioxoimidazolidines [22], phenothiazanes [23], thiophenes
[24], and biphenyls [25] are also in development.
Virtual screening is widely applied for identification
of novel targeted drugs. This strategy is generally divided
into structure based virtual screening (SBVS) and ligand
based virtual screening (LBVS). Although these may
appear to be two independent approaches to drug design,
in practice they can be utilized together in a mutually
advantageous way. Q.D. You pioneered use of LBVS
and structure based drug design (SBDD) for discovery
of novel Eg5 inhibitors, and this led to the discovery
and identification of 1,4-dihydroquinolin-4-ones and
1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinazolin-4-ones [26, 27]. The first
successful application of virtual screening in this field was
conducted by F. Kozielski, who combined pharmacophore
modeling and molecular docking to identify three novel
Eg5 inhibitors bearing quinazoline and thioxoimidazolidine
scaffolds [22].
Inspired by these previous adaptations of computer
aided drug design (CADD) in the field of Eg5 inhibitor
discovery, we further optimized the workflow to search
for a new scaffold with antitumor activity. In the first
round of virtual screening for potential Eg5 inhibitors, a
pharmacophore model (Supplementary Figure 1A, 1B) was
combined with in silico docking (Supplementary Figure 1C)
to identify the compound 7170 which had a moderate
degree of antitumor activity (Supplementary Figure 1D).
However, this compound does not break away from the
triphenylmethyl scaffold of S-Trityl-L-cysteine (Table 1).
In view of this scaffold’s limited potential for further
development, we decided to conduct a second round of
virtual screening by scaffold hopping. As the strict shape
constraints of the pharmacophore model were likely to
limit the ability of virtual screening to break away from
the original scaffold, ROCS and EON from OpenEye was
selected to perform a 3D similarity search. Multiple studies
were used ROCS and EON for successful 3D similarity
searches [28], offering an abundant source of material for
refining our virtual screening protocol and optimizing the
success rate [29, 30].
The 3D similarity search in the second round of
virtual screening resulted in successful scaffold hopping,
as the 1,5-disubstituted tetrazole compound YL001 is
structurally unique in the field of Eg5 inhibitor research.
This agent induces the Eg5-specific monopolar spindle
phenotype and displays a strong antiproliferative activity
over a broad range of cancer cell lines, including the taxolresistant A2780 cell line and the 6TG-resistant 4T1 cell line.
In a melanoma xenograft mouse model, YL001 inhibited
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tumor growth by 60% and prolonged median survival time
by more than 50%. These findings demonstrated YL001 has
the potential for Eg5 targeted therapy.

RESULTS
Discovery of YL001 by virtual screening
The workflow for virtual screening is shown in
Figure 1A. The co-crystallized conformation of five STLC
analogues (including STLC) with strong bioactivity (PDB
ID: 2XAE, 3KEN, 4A50, 4A51 and 4BBG) were extracted,
aligned and utilized to generate queries for the similarity
search. These queries were subsequently validated through
ROCS using the Database of Useful Decoys Enhanced
(DUD-E) Eg5 inhibitor subset. The best query (query5),
which featured ligands from 3KEN, 4A50 and 4BBG, and
the best ROCS scoring method (ranked by shape tanimoto
only) were selected due to their extraordinary performance
in validation results (Supplementary Figure 2B–2D, 2F).
Parameters for molecule conformation generation
(OMEGA, OpenEye) were optimized and single-molecule
queries for EON were subsequently validated and selected.
Ligands of 4A51 and 4BBG were selected as singlemolecule queries for EON rescoring, as they both showed
enhanced performance compared to the Non-EON group
and random selection group (Supplementary Figure 2E).
Molecules from the Specs database (204,000 compounds)
were filtered with FILTER (OpenEye) to exclude molecules
with an unfavorable druggability profile; prepared with
OMEGA using optimized parameters; screened, scored and
filtered through ROCS and EON; docked into the allosteric
pockets of three individual Eg5 crystal structures (PDB ID:
4A50, 4A51 and 4BBG; Figure 1E) to inspect the calculated
binding affinity and the binding mode; clustered by structure,
and manually selected. In the virtual screening, YL001
showed good molecular shape similarity with query5, with
a shape tanimoto score of 0.70 (Figure 1C). This molecule
also ranked first in EON electrostatic shape comparison. In
Figure 1D, it is evident that the N,N-dimethylamine group
closely mimics the amino group from the query, while the
trifluoromethyl group simulates the function of the alkyl
group. Docking studies were conducted with AutoDockVina
to determine whether the superpositioned conformation
was consistent with the docking results [31]. For three
different receptors (4A50, 4A51 and 4BBG) the average
binding affinity (n = 3) for the best binding conformations
of YL001 were –8.9, –9.4 and –9.2 kcal/mol respectively.
A hydrogen bond was found between the protonated N,Ndimethylamine group and Glu116, and the trifluoromethyl
group fitted into the subpocket where the alkyl group of the
original ligands was located, adequately filling the pocket
as in the superpositioned conformation. This validated the
ROCS and EON results (Figure 1B, 1E). After completion
of the workflow, 23 molecules were purchased from Specs
for evaluation in further assays.

Enzymatic EC50s were assessed in Eg5 ATPase activity and cellular EC50s were evaluated on HeLa cell line. KD values were
calculated with SPR Biacore T200. STLC was used as a control.

Validation of YL001 as a highly selective
antitumor agent targeted on Eg5

with phenotypic and target-based screening, YL001 was
identified as an Eg5 inhibitor with significant in vitro
antitumor activity without obvious cytotoxicity against
normal cells (Supplementary Table 2).
Activity and selectivity are two critical properties
for small molecule enzyme inhibitors. Selectivity was
a concern since YL001 has an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl
bond which may react with endogenous nucleophiles via
Michael addition and lead to cross-reaction with proteins
in vivo. However, we found that YL001 is not active
enough to react with highly active nucleophiles. YL001
was incubated with cysteine and lysine for 24 hours at
37°C and no new products were detected by HRMS. To
further quantitatively analyze the selectivity of YL001,
we assessed YL001 activity in a comprehensive panel
of 468 typical, atypical and mutant human kinases
at a concentration of 1 μM [32]. As expected, with a
selectivity score of 0.00, YL001 displayed no activity at
a concentration of 1 μM (taking into consideration the
~1% system false positive rate) (Supplementary Figure 3).
These results confirm YL001 is not a covalent inhibitor,
but a highly selective Eg5 inhibitor.

All 23 compounds selected by virtual screening
were investigated with a novel comprehensive validation
strategy to directly pick hits. This strategy combined
enzymatic screening and SPR (as target-based screening)
with cytotoxic and monopolar spindle screening (as
phenotypic screening with high content imaging), allowing
us to take advantage of both phenotypic and target-based
screening, as well as to validate the compounds with strong
anti-Eg5 activity (Supplementary Table 1). YL001 was
selected using this strategy, and showed an EC50 of 1.18 μM
on enzymatic assay, as well as an EC50 of 14.27  μM
in HeLa cells with a monopolar spindle phenotype.
Moreover, it bound to the Eg5 motor domain tightly,
with a KD of 1.327×10–7 M as detected by SPR (Table 1).
YL001 exhibited a KD constant which was two-fold
stronger than the positive control STLC (3.767 × 10–7 M),
and an order of magnitude stronger than compound 7170
which was identified in the first round of virtual screening
(1.131 ×  10–6 M). Through use of double validation

YL001 induces a monopolar spindle phenotype,
resulting in mitotic arrest and cell death

over 80% (Figure 2B). To further observe the effect of
YL001 induced cell cycle arrest, colony formation using
different concentrations of the compound was carried
out to measure the IC50. HeLa cells were exposed to
YL001 for 24 hours and maintained in culture for 10 days
without further treatment. The number of clones following
YL001 treatment was significantly less than the number
following STLC treatment. YL001 inhibited colony
formation with an IC50 of 124 nM, demonstrating that in
regard to antitumor activity, YL001 is stronger than STLC
(IC50 = 1.25 μM) by an order of magnitude (Figure 2C).

YL001 strongly inhibited cell cycle progression.
Exposure of cultured cells to YL001 produced the hallmark
phenotype of Eg5 inhibition with an accumulation of cells
in G2/M phase. High content imaging was performed on
HeLa cells over a series of gradient concentrations of
YL001, which induced a monopolar spindle phenotype in
which cells showed a rosette of condensed chromosomes
attached to a radial array of microtubules, wrapped in
a round actin skeleton. As analyzed with Columbus,
treatment with this compound led to monopolar spindles
with an EC50 of 15.30 μM, demonstrating that normal
mitotic spindle configuration is disrupted (Figure 2A).
Cytoflow was conducted on multiple cancer cell
lines. As expected, all cell lines tested (HCT 116, HeLa
and MCF7) showed arrest at G2/M, especially HCT
116. After 8 hours treatment with 50 μM YL001, the
percentage of cells with 4N DNA content surged to

range of 5–20 μM (Table 2). CNE-2Z (nasopharyngeal
cancer) and K562 (leukemia) cells were especially sensitive
to treatment. HT1080 with an EC50 of over 70 μM was the
only cell line which was not sensitive to treatment among
the 15 cell lines tested. According to BioGPS data [33], in
the four cell lines with available Eg5 gene expression level
data, Eg5 expression ranked as HeLa > MCF-7 > U87
> HT1080. This shows the efficiency of YL001 activity
is positively correlated with Eg5 gene expression. In
addition, Eg5 inhibitors would be expected to be effective
in cancers which are resistant to tubulin-targeting agents
[34], where resistance results from mutation of betatubulin or alteration in the expression of tubulin isoforms
[35, 36]. As expected, YL001 has shown activity in the
taxol resistant cell line A2780 and the 6-Thiaguanine
resistant cell line 4T1, which suggests YL001 has
significant potential for therapy of drug-resistant tumors.
The strong broad-spectrum antitumor activity
displayed by YL001 against cultured cells prompted
further evaluation of in vivo activity of YL001 in a B16
rodent melanoma xenograft model. After testing a range
of YL001 doses in healthy B6 mice without tumor, we
estimated the maximal therapeutic dose to be 200 mg/kg
taking into consideration the solubility of YL001. Doses
of 200 mg/kg were administrated daily for 10 days to
B6 mice with tumor xenografts of the highly malignant

melanoma B16. Animals with this xenograft in general
exhibit a low survival rate and poor response to
chemotherapy. However, i.p. treatment with YL001
significantly suppressed tumor growth with a minimum
T/C ratio of 0.40 (P < 0.05 for tumor volume compared to
controls) (Figure 3A) and an absence of toxicity (P > 0.05
for body weight loss compared to controls) (Figure 3B).
Median survival results (Figure 3C) showed prolongation
of the treatment group’s survival time by 50% over that of
the control (Table 3). YL001 thus has excellent antitumor
activity in this xenograft model, and no adverse effects
were observed.
To determine whether YL001 inhibited Eg5 function
in the B16 xenograft model, we examined the phenotype
of mitotic cells in tumor tissues. Histochemisty analysis of
tumor tissue demonstrated that YL001 induces mitotic arrest
accompanied by formation of monopolar spindles through
inhibition of Eg5 (Figure 3D, 3E), and has antitumor
activity in xenograft tumor models (Figure 3A, 3C).
We also assessed the half-life of YL001 in the plasma
in HeLa xenograft nude mice. The results (Figure 3F)
show YL001 has a favorable pharmacokinetic property
with t1/2 = 5.3 hours. These results indicate that YL001
has favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
characteristics which warrant further investigation of this
agent as an antitumor agent.

YL001 causes mitotic failure leading to cell death
through activation of caspase-3

Western blot was used for analysis of cleaved
PARP1, which is a product of Caspase-3 that serves as a
marker for intrinsic apoptosis. After 24 hours treatment
with YL001, PARP1 cleavage increased dramatically
(Figure 4A, lane 2 vs. lane 5), and the accumulation of
cleaved PARP1 persisted for 48 hours (Figure 4A, lane 3
vs. lane 6). This shows YL001-induced cell death is
due to apoptosis caused by Caspase-3 activation [34].
In addition, the marker of phosphor histone H3, which
is specifically phosphorylated in mitosis, was evaluated

High content imaging in the YL001 treated group
of cells showed cell fragments including many apoptotic
bodies reflecting apoptosis, which leads to cell death by
the activation of caspases. Caspase-3 is the most important
of these caspases and plays a central role in transduction
of apoptotic signals as an effector, and its activation leads
to protein degradation.

yielded successful scaffold hopping. Similarity search
based methodology generally outperforms molecular
docking in efficiency, and 3D-similarity search achieves
scaffold hopping albeit at the cost of a decrease in the
success rate when compared to traditional 2D-similarity
searches and molecular docking [44–46]. Thus, considering
the small pool size of the compounds tested, the success
rate (one hit out of 23 molecules tested, which is 4.3%)
was satisfactory.
In phenotypic screening, an effective high content
imaging method was introduced to identify potential
hit compounds. In current practice, screening based on
phenotype plays a more critical role in the early stages
of drug discovery. Prior to the 1980s, most drugs were
discovered with use of phenotypic screening in vitro
or in vivo. However with the development of clone
technology, phenotypic screening in drug discovery was
gradually de-emphasized under comparison with the then
emerging high-throughput, target-specific in vitro assays
[47]. During the heyday of targeted cancer therapy at the
beginning of 21st century, numerous potential drug targets
were discovered, and screening assays were constructed
based on these targets. However, this approach yielded
many clinical candidates but resulted in few new marketed
drugs [48].This was attributed to the fact that targetbased drug screening did not take disease pathogenesis
into account, and targeted drugs still incur the risk of
inducing adaptive drug resistance [49]. We surmised that
by combining phenotypic and target-based screening,
advantages of both methods could be maximized and
disadvantages could be minimized. This provided a novel
platform for drug discovery which is economical and
effective, and is adaptable to other research systems.
As expected, introduction of YL001 resulted
in failure of mitosis by inhibiting ATPase function
and accumulation of T926 phosphorylated Eg5, thus

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have successfully combined
virtual screening, target-based screening and phenotypic
screening as a novel strategy to discover a novel scaffold
Eg5 inhibitor with strong anti-neoplastic activity
economically and efficiently. This novel strategy may
offer guidance for discovery of other new targeted drugs.
Query is the core of a 3D similarity search in
virtual screening. STLC was a structurally simple lead
compound with distinctive antitumor activity [19, 20]. As
numerous previous studies had discussed its SAR and cocrystallization structures with Eg5 [40–43], it was clear
that STLC analogues were suitable for building our query,
and supporting effective screening for novel modulators
of the target as well. Analysis of co-crystal structures of
STLC with Eg5 showed that the crystallized bioactive
conformation of these STLC analogues superimposed well
within the Eg5 allosteric pocket. We therefore supposed
that use of a highly congruent superimposed bioactive
conformation as a shape query would not only provide
greater space for accommodating the molecular overlay,
but would also circumvent the limitations of single
molecule queries, and thus would be more compatible with
discovery of new scaffolds.
Over the course of development of this compound,
its chemical scaffold underwent a substantial structural
change from the triphenylmethyl scaffold (STLC) to
the final novel 1,5-disubstituted tetrazole (YL001). This
would have been difficult to achieve using conventional
drug design approaches such as bioisosteric fragment
replacement. However, this virtual screening workflow

by shape tanimoto) for the optimized method was used
as an input for EON (2.1.0, OpenEye) query validation.
Since EON only accepts single-molecule queries, only
the single-compound queries acquired directly from the
original crystalized conformation were evaluated using the
default parameters. The output was ranked by ET_Combo
(Supplementary Figure 1F).

Database preparations

MATERIALS AND METHODS

A HypoGen pharmacophore model was generated
by Discovery Studio 2.5 modeled on the study of Liu
et al. [27]. Compounds from the PKU database were
prepared and screened through this pharmacophore model,
which contains four features including an aromatic ring,
a hydrophobic, a hydrogen bond acceptor and a donor.
The Eg5-ispinesib complex crystal structure (PDB code
4AP0) was used for in silico docking via GOLD 3.0.
All compounds tested interacted with the Eg5 allosteric
pocket. 100 top scored compounds in both two models
were kept in the best-binding conformations for virtual
analysis. Eventually six low weight molecules were
obtained for the further validation.

The Specs database (~204,000 compounds) was
used as the screening library. All compounds were first
treated with Pipeline Pilot v7.5 (Accelrys) to generate 3D
coordination, strip salt, minimize molecule energy, and
standardize the chemical table coding. FILTER 2.1.1 from
OpenEye was then applied to filter unfavorable compounds
using the recommended filter criteria documented in filter_
blockbuster.txt provided by OpenEye. Conformations
were generated by OMEGA 2.4.6 using the optimized
parameters with the FLIPPER module turned on.

Virtual screening
All conformations were compared to query5 using
ROCS 3.1.2 on molecular shape and ranked by shape
tanimoto. The first 5,000 molecules were kept and reevaluated by EON 2.1.0 to preserve the first 500 molecules
with the highest ET_Combo score. Two separate hit lists
produced by using the two different EON queries were
merged with Pipeline Pilot. Molecules with the following
properties were discarded: ADMET Solubility Level = 0,
rotatable bonds > 9 (both properties calculated by Pipeline
Pilot), which left 389 molecules for post screening analysis.

Virtual screening round two procedures
Query validation and parameter optimization with OMEGA,
ROCS and EON

Five STLC-typed ligands with strong binding capacity
in their crystalized and bioactive conformations were
selected (PDB ID: 2XAE, 3KEN, 4A50, 4A51 and 4BBG).
The ligand 4BBG was modified to remove the unwanted
aromatic tautomer state, and was then aligned with
Discovery Studio V2.5 (Accelrys) using the default
settings of the molecular overlay module. Five Queries
were generated using aligned molecules by vROCS 3.1.2
(OpenEye) with the following parameters: maximum
molecules per model = 5, models to keep = 5, merge color
atoms = True. Four of five output queries were multi-ligand
queries, and one query was a single-compound query.
ROCS query validation was validated with the KIF11
subset of DUD-E selected to assess the performance of
different queries, scoring functions and running modes
[50]. Conformations of the validation set were generated
by OMEGA 2.4.6 (OpenEye) using default parameters
with the FLIPPER module turned on. All of the singlecompound queries acquired directly from the original
crystalized conformations were assessed as well. Query
validation data is recorded in Supplementary Figure 1.
Parameters of OMEGA were also subsequently optimized
on query5 using the same validation method. Ranges of all
relevant parameters (“ewindow” from 5, 10 to 15 kcal/mol
and “rms” from 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 to 0.6 angstroms respectively)
were chosen according to several important references. For
maximum efficiency, we had the parameter “maxconfs” set

Pose screening analysis
All 389 molecules were docked into the allosteric
pocket of three different receptors (PDB ID: 4A50, 4A51
and 4BBG) by AutoDockVina (1.1.2, Scripps) with default
settings. Best-binding conformations were manually
inspected in Open-Source PyMOL v1.3.x (Schrödinger).
Hydrogen bond and ligand embedding ratios were
speculatively assigned and calculated by the third-party
PyMOL scripts. In the three separate docked poses
corresponding to each receptor, at least two were expected
to be successfully docked into the allosteric pocket to be
considered a reliable pose, and the average embedding ratio
of those poses was expected to be larger than 0.6. Moreover,
at least two reliable poses were expected to have no less
than one hydrogen bond interaction with the receptor,
and the average hydrogen bond interaction count of these
reliable poses was larger than one. In addition, the average
binding affinity for these reliable poses was expected to
be stronger than -9 kcal/mol. After docking analysis, 77
molecules were kept for further study. These molecules

were clustered using the Ligand Cluster protocol provided
by Pipeline Pilot, and the results were modified manually
for better results. No more than two molecules were
selected per cluster. Finally, 24 molecules were confirmed,
and 23 of these were purchased from Specs (one of them
was unavailable) to be evaluated in further assays. The 2D
binding plot was generated by the PoseView web service
[51].

added to this solution and stirred vigorously at 0°Cfor
30 minutes. The product was then collected by suction
filtration, washed with a solution of 1.642 g (11.7 mmol,
0.6 eq.) NaClO4•H2O in 16.4 mL water, and dried in
vacuo. The product (6.795 g) was as light yellow solid,
was pure enough to be used directly in the next reaction.
Yield was considered as 100%.
Step 3: In a bottle with two necks 2.945 g
(45.3  mmol, 2.3 eq.) of NaN3 and 50 mL methanol
were stirred at 60°C under reflux. Product from step 2
was added portion wise, and gas was allowed to release
completely before adding the next portion. After product
from step 2 was completely added, the mixture was stirred
for another 30 minutes at 60°C under reflux. The mixture
was then cooled to room temperature. Excess distilled
water was poured into the mixture while stirring to let the
product precipitate. The product was filtered by suction
filtration, washed with diluted water (10 mL × 2), and
dried in vacuo. The product (2.300 g, 10 mmol) was as
pink solid, and was pure enough to be used directly in a
next reaction. Yield was 50.5%.
Step 4: To a solution of the product from step 3
(229 mg, 1.0 mmol, 1 eq.) in 5 mL anhydrous toluene,
triethylamine 0.17 mL (1.2 mmol, 1.2 eq.) was added and
stirred at 0°C for 10 minutes. 3-(Trifluoromethyl)benzoyl
chloride (1.2 mmol, 1.2 eq.) was added dropwise, and stirred
for another 30 minutes at 0°C. The mixture was stirred and
heated to 105°C under reflux for 8 hours. The mixture
was then cooled to room temperature, and 10 mL EA and
50 mL of water were added to the mixture and extracted.
The water phase was extracted with EA (10 mL × 3),
and the organic phases were combined and washed with
brine (50 mL × 3). The organic phase was dried with
anhydrous Na2SO4. After the solvent was removed under
vacuum, the residue was separated with silica gel column
chromatography (PE: EA = 1: 1 to 1: 2 to 100% EA) which
yielded the crude product. The crude product was heated
and recrystallized in methanol, the crystal product was
washed with anhydrous ether three times, and dried in
vacuo. Final product, YL001, was as light yellow crystal,

Organic synthesis
Solvents and reagents were obtained from
commercial suppliers and were used without further
purification. Reactions were monitored with thin layer
chromatography (TLC) on GF254 silica gel plates (Anhui
LiangChen Silicon Material Co. Ltd.). The spots were
visualized using an ultraviolet light. Flash chromatography
was carried out on silica gel zcx-II (48–75 μm, Branch of
Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co. Ltd.) using the indicated
solvents (PE, boiling range 60–90°C). 1H NMR spectra
and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE
III 400 (400 MHz) spectrometer in D-reagents with
tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal reference. NMR
chemical shifts are reported as values (ppm) relative
to internal TMS. Splitting patterns were designated
as: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m =
multiplet. Melting points were measured as uncorrected
values. High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)
was measured with an LTQ ObitrapElite spectrometer
using ionspray methodology. High-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) was carried out using a
ZORBAX SB-C18 column 5 μm, 4.6 × 250mm.
Typical synthesis procedure for the target compound
YL001 ((Z)-3-(dimethylamino)-2-(1-(p-tolyl)-1H-tetrazol5-yl)-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)prop-2-en-1-one)
Step 1: A solution of 4.0 mL (30 mmol, 1 eq.)
4›-methyl-acetophenone
was
added
to
N,NDimethylformamide dimethyl acetal 8.0 mL (60 mmol, 2 eq.)
and this mixture was stirred at 115°C under reflux for
30 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room
temperature, and red crystals were precipitated. The product
was collected through suction filtration, washed with PE
(15 mL × 3) and dried in vacuo. The product (4.532 g, 23.9
mmol), consisting of orange crystals, was pure enough to
be used directly in the next reaction. The yield was 79.7%.
Step 2: To a solution of the product from step 1
(3.730 g, 19.7 mmol, 1 eq.) in 13.1 mL cold anhydrous
dichloromethane (DCM) stirred at 0°C, a solution of
POCl3 (1.84 mL, 19.7 mmol, 1 eq.) in 4.9 mL cold
anhydrous DCM was added dropwise. This mixture was
then stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes and 0°C
for another 10 minutes. The intermediate was collected
through suction filtration, and washed with 10 mL cold
anhydrous DCM. While filtering the intermediate, 8.276 g

were applied at corresponding concentrations in running
buffer at a flow rate of 30 µL/minute with a contact time
of 60 seconds and a dissociation time of 60 seconds. Chip
platforms were washed with running buffer and 50%
DMSO. Data were analyzed with Biacore evaluation
software (T200 Version 1.0) by curve fitting using a steady
state 1:1 binding model and a kinetic model.

Compounds and reagents

Nucleophilic addition assay

STLC was from Alladin (1121390) (Shanghai,
China). The compounds of interest identified by virtual
screening were purchased from Specs. YL001 was first
purchased from Specs, then synthesized in our laboratory.
All compounds were prepared as 10 mM DMSO stock,
and were sequentially diluted in growth medium. Cells
were treated with compounds by medium exchange.

0.5 mmol YL001 was solved in a solution of THF/
H2O (v:v = 1:1) and stirred with nucleophiles (0.5 mmol
L-cysteine or L-lysine) at 37°C for 24 hours. Products
were then validated by HRMS.

Kinase profiling
Kinase profiling was conducted by the DiscoverX as
KINOMEscan profiling service for testing the inhibition
of YL001 of interest against 468 kinases [53]. Selectivity
score S(35) was defined as follows:
S(35) = (number of non-mutant kinases with%
Control < 35)/(number of non-mutant kinases tested).

Antibodies
Cell lysates from cultured cells were prepared and
analyzed by immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membranes.
The following antibodies were used in this study: Mouse
total anti-Eg5 T926 (620502) anti-Eg5 total (627802)
was purchased from Biolegend. Rabbit anti-cleaved
PARP (D64E10) (CS-5625P) and anti phospho histone
H3 (ser10) (CST3377) antibody was from Cell Signaling
Technologies. Mouse anti-GAPDH antibody was from
Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology (Beijing,
China). Anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG coupled
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA).

Antiproliferation assays
Cytotoxic activities of the compounds of interest
were investigated with human cancer cell lines using the
Alamar Blue assay. Cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded
into 96-well plates (Corning, 3603). Various sample
concentrations (compounds of interest) were added to
each well in duplicate, and incubated at 37°C with 5%
CO2 for two days such that cells were in the exponential
growth phase at the time of drug addition. Ten microliters
of the Alamar Blue Solution (Invitrogen, Alamar Blue)
were added to each well and incubated at 37°C for up
to 2 hours in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. After
incubation, florescence was measured using a microplate
reader (Tecan) at an excitation wavelength of 540 nm and
emission of 590 nm. Each inhibitory concentration was
measured in triplicate, and averaged data points ± SD are
shown. Statistical analysis was carried out with GraphPad
Prism 5 and the fifty-percent effective concentration is
expressed as EC50.

Inhibition of Eg5 ATPase Activity
All experiments were performed as previously
described [52]. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
5 and Microsoft Excel to obtain EC50 values. STLC was
used as a positive control. Each inhibitory concentration
was measured in triplicate, and averaged data points ±  SD
are shown.

SPR Assay
Interactions of the Eg5 motor domain and
compounds of interest were analyzed using the Biacore
T200 system (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) at 25°C.
Eg5 motor protein obtained as previously described
(51) was immobilized on a sensor chip (CM5) using an
amine coupling kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire,
UK). Final Eg5 immobilization levels were typically
~23000 RU. Subsequently, compounds were injected as
analytes at various concentrations, using PBS-P (10 mM
phosphate buffer with 2.7 mM KCl and 137 mM NaCl,
0.05% Surfactant P20, pH 4.5, GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden) as a running buffer. For binding studies, analytes

Immunofluorescence microscopy
HeLa cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well
plates (Corning, 3603). Drugs were diluted appropriately
in medium from 10 mM stocks in 100% DMSO and added
to the cells. Following 8 hours incubation with drugs,
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (20 minutes
at room temperature), permeabilized with PBST (0.5%
Triton X-100 in PBS) for 15 minutes, and washed before
blocking. Cells were blocked with 4% BSA for at least
30 minutes at room temperature and stained with anti-β42520

tubulin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) at 400-fold dilution
for 1 hour with Alexafluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) at 300-fold dilution
for 1 hour. DNA was detected with 4’,6-diamidino-2phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). Actin was detected
with Phalloidin. High content screening (Perkin Elmer
Operetta) was used to photograph stained cells at 40×
magnification, and Columbus software was used for
statistical analysis of the percentage of mitotic cells with
monopolar spindles present in treated cells over the total
number of cells in mitosis counted after 8 hours incubation
with drugs.

efficiency was expressed as the ratio of the mean
experimental V/V0 value to that of the control group
[treated versus control (T/C) ratio], where V is the tumor
volume on the day of evaluation and V0 is the tumor
volume on the day of initial treatment with the drug. Drug
efficiency was also evaluated by median survival. All
statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 5.

Histochemistry
On day 10 after the first treatment, all mice were
sacrificed. Tumors from two mice in each group were
fixed with formalin and analyzed histologically using
H&E staining.

Flow cytometry
HeLa cells (1 × 106 cells per well) were plated in
6-well plates (Nunc, 140675). 10 mM stock was diluted
into an appropriate final concentration solution with
growth medium. After 12 hours, cells were incubated
with compounds for 12 hours in 37°C with 5% CO2, using
DMSO as a negative control and 50 μM STLC as a positive
control. Medium was removed and PBS was used for
washing twice. Cells were then digested with trypsin into
a single-cell solution and fixed with methanol overnight at
4°C. Fixative was removed and cells were washed twice
with PBS. 25 μL 20×RNaseA was added followed by
incubation for 30 minutes at 37°C. 5 μL of PI was added
followed by incubation for 30 minutes at 4°C. Cytoflow
was carried out by BD FACSVerse (BD Biosciences, US).

Pharmacokinetic study
A HPLC-MS/MS method was developed for singledose pharmacokinetic (PK) study of YL001 in HeLa
xenograft BALB/c nude mice. YL001 was administered
intraperitoneally at a dose of 200 mg/kg. Blood samples
were then collected by enucleating eyeballs at 0.083,
0.167, 0.333, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 hours in heparinized
polypropylene tubes. Three mice were sacrificed at each
time point. Samples were centrifuged immediately at 4000
r/min for 20 min to separate plasma. The final sample for
HPLC-MS/MS detection by QTRAP 6500 (AB Sciex,
USA) was a mixture (plasma: H2O: methanol = 1:1:8). All
individual data were pooled together to further perform PK
analysis. DAS 2.1.2 were used to estimate PK parameters
by non-compartmental analysis.

Colony formation
HeLa cells (5 × 102 cells/well) were seeded into
6-well plates and were treated with a series of gradient
concentrations of YL001 for 24 hours, followed by washing
and continual culture for 10 days. DMSO was used as a
negative control, and STLC was used as a positive control.
Cells were fixed with ethanol for more than 30 minutes and
dyed with crystal violet for more than 30 minutes. Clones
were counted with OpenCFU [54].
