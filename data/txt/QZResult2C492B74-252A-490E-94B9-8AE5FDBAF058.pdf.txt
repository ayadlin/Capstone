ABSTRACT
Metastases cause recurrence and mortality for patients with colorectal carcinomas
(CRC). In present study, we evaluated heterogeneity on drug resistance and its
underlying mechanism between metastatic and primary CRC.Immunohistochemical
results from clinical tissue microarray (TMA) suggested that the expression
concordance rates of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and drug resistance relative proteins
between lymph-node metastatic and primary CRC foci were low. The apoptotic and
proliferation indexes in metastasis CRC specimens were decreased compared with
primary. In vitro experimental results indicated that the migration and invasion
abilities were upregulated in metastatic cells SW620 compared with primary cells
SW480, the cellular efflux ability and WNT/β-catenin activity were also upregulated
in SW620 cells. After 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) treatment, the reduction in the proportion
of cell apoptosis, CD133 and TERT expression levels in SW620 were lower than that in
SW480 cells. Bioinformatics analysis in whole-genome transcriptional profiling results
between metastatic and primary CRC cells suggested that differentially expressed
genes were mainly centered on well-characterized signaling pathways including WNT/
β-catenin, cell cycle and cell junction. Collectively, heterogeneity of drug resistant was
present between metastatic and primary CRC specimens and cell lines, the abnormal
activation of WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway could be a potential molecular leading
to drug resistant ability enhancing in metastatic CRC cells.

[3–5]. Thiruvengadam and colleagues reported that Zeb-1
and other regulators of EMT maintain drug resistance
in human pancreatic cancer cells [6]. Moreover, the
process of EMT leads to great increases in the number
of self-renewing cells that can initiate the seeding of
mammospheres, which raises the possibility for achieving
EMT process, at the same time, may also impart selfrenewal and multidrug resistance capabilities to metastatic
cancer cells [7].
Chemotherapy has synergistic effects with
radiotherapy and surgery and play vital roles in combined
therapy for CRC [8, 9]. Chemotherapy insensitivity and
poor prognosis are biological characteristics of metastases
CRC [10], but little is known about the biological
behaviors differences between primary and metastatic

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common
malignancies in the world. Approximately 25% to 50% of
colorectal cancer patients develop metastatic disease [1].
Once metastasis has occurred in CRC, a complete cure of
the disease is unlikely. Colorectal liver metastasis (CLM),
occurring in about 20% of CRC patients during the course
of their treatment, is the most common distant metastasis
from CRC [2, 3].
The phenotype of human CRC cells mainly
depends on the interaction of genetic and environmental
factors. Numerous researches have pointed out that the
heterogeneity was formed during and after the process of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC cells

CRC, especially at difference of drug resistance.
Therefore, there is a need for better understanding of
the molecular mechanisms underlying the metastatic
phenotype that may provide information leading to the
development of drugs to control or prevent metastatic
disease.
In present study, to a much better understanding of
biological differences between primary and metastatic
CRC, we used high-throughput DNA microarrays to
compare differentially expressed genes of primary
and metastatic CRC cells. The migration and invasion
abilities difference between primary CRC cells SW480
and metastatic cells SW620 were determined through
transwell and boyden chamber assays. We found that the
ability of drug resistant in metastatic cells SW620 was
greater than primary colorectal cancer cells SW480 owing
to cancer stem cells and drug resistance relative proteins
activation, which partially reconfirmed by the clinical
TMA IHC assay.

Meanwhile, the expression level of EpCAM (Membrane),
E-cadherin and MRP were significantly higher in primary
CRC foci compared with the corresponding lymph-node
metastatic foci (Table 1 and 2, p < 0.001).

Comparison of the proliferation and apoptotic
index between primary CRC and colorectal
lymphatic metastasis specimens
The apoptosis of CRC specimens was examined
using TUNEL staining assay in CRC specimens, the
apoptotic index of colorectal lymphatic metastasis
specimens was significantly decreased compared to primary
CRC specimens (Figure 2A, p < 0.001). The proliferation
index of CRC specimens was also examined using Cyclin
D1 staining assay in CRC specimens (Figure 2B), we
found that the proliferation index of colorectal lymphatic
metastasis specimens was significantly decreased compared
to primary CRC specimens (p < 0.05).

RESULTS

The adhesive activity was downregulated, the
efflux rate of Rh123 and WNT/β-catenin activity
were upregulated in metastatic cells SW620

Comparison of the CSCs and drug resistance
relative proteins between primary CRC and
colorectal lymphatic metastasis specimens

The migration and invasion abilities difference
between SW480 and SW620 cells were determined through
transwell assays and boyden chamber assays. As shown in
Figure 3A, the migration and invasion abilities of SW620
cells were significantly greater than SW480 cells (p < 0.05).
Detection of the key components of cell migration and
invasion pathways by western blotting demonstrated that
compared to SW480 cells, the expression levels of CD44v6
and MMP-9 were elevated, while the level of E-cadherin
was decreased in SW620 cells (Figure 3B, p < 0.05).
These results demonstrated that metastatic cells SW620
have greater migration and invasion abilities than primary
colorectal cancer cells SW480.
To examine the P-gp function between SW480
and SW620 cells, the fluorescence intensity of Rh123
was measured by flow cytometry and the efflux rate of
Rh123 was calculated. As shown in Figure 3C, the efflux
rate of Rh123 was higher in SW620 cells than that in
SW480 cells (p < 0.05). More interestingly, western blot
analysis of β-catenin proteins in cytoplasmic and nuclear
displayed that β-catenin was upregulated in the nuclei of
SW620 compared to SW480 cells (Figure 3D, p < 0.05).
Immunofluorescence analysis verified that β-catenin was
more favored distributed in the nuclei of SW620 cells
compared with SW480 cells (Figure 3E).

To gain insight into the expression level of CSCs
and drug resistance relative proteins in CRC, we used the
clinical tissue microarray to assess these protein expression
levels between primary CRC and colorectal lymphatic
metastasis specimens. The expression level of EpCAM
(Membrane), E-cadherin, MRP, CD133 and Cyclin D1
were significantly upregulated in primary CRC foci
compared with the corresponding lymph-node metastatic
foci, whereas CD44v6 was downregulated in primary CRC
foci (Figure 1A and 1B, p < 0.05). In addition, although
there was no significant difference in the expression level of
β-catenin between primary CRC and colorectal lymphatic
metastasis specimens overall, the ratio of high expression
(+++) of β-catenin was signifcantly higher in lymph-node
metastatic foci (22.03%) compared with the corresponding
primary CRC foci (10.16%, Figure 1A and 1B).
The concordance rates of the CSCs and drug
resistance relative proteins between the primary CRC foci
and corresponding lymph-node metastatic foci were showed
in Figure 1C. The concordance rates were low, and there
was only one protein, CD44v6, with over 50% concordance
rate. To a better understanding the relationships of these
CSCs and drug resistance relative proteins between
the primary CRC foci and corresponding lymph-node
metastatic foci, hierarchical clustering was generated by
R programming language based on IHC results. Statistical
analysis revealed that the expression level of E-cadherin
was positively correlated with MRP and EpCAM expression
in both primary CRC foci and corresponding lymphnode metastatic foci (Figure 1D and 1E, Table 1 and 2).

assay. Similarly, we found that 5-Fu could significantly
increase the apoptosis in SW480 compared to SW620

metastatic cells SW620 have greater drug resistant ability
than primary colorectal cancer cells SW480.
To investigate the underlying mechanisms leading
to SW620 drug resistant ability enhancing, we assessed
whether these effects of SW620 cells was due to cancer
stem cells and drug resistance relative proteins activation.
After either treated with 5-Fu or control for 24 h, the
effect of 5-Fu on the proportion of CD133+ of SW480
and SW620 cells was examined using flow cytometry. As
shown in Figure 4C, the proportions of CD133+ SW480
cells were significantly decreased compared to SW620
cells (p < 0.05). As shown in Figure 4D, following
24 h treatment of 5-Fu, the expression level of TERT was
downregulated in SW480 cells, whereas these effects were
slight in SW620 cells. In addition, the expression levels
of EpCAM were downregulated following 24 h treatment
of 5-Fu in both SW480 and SW620 cells (Figure 4D,
p < 0.05).

generated and showed in Figure 5C and Table 3 using the
GenCLiP 2.0 online tool.

on microarray data between SW480 and SW620
cells
Next, we extracted total RNA and conducted cDNA
microarrays analysis (Roche, NimbleGen) between CRC
cells derived from human primary colorectal cancer
cells SW480 and their metastatic cells SW620. We then
performed supervised analysis using SAM and identified
1,362 unique genes with aberrant expression in SW620
when compared to SW480 cells. Functional annotations
of the differentially expressed genes were generated using
the GenCLiP 2.0 online tool.
As shown in Figure 6A, heatmap showing the

clustering, the 16 highest-ranking literature profiles-based

listed in Figure 6B. We screened the most relevant genes
associated with these keywords. Gene-gene interaction

Figure 6C using the GenCLiP 2.0 online tool.

Screening differentially expressed genes based
on microarray data between metastatic and

In order to survey the differentially expressed genes
between metastatic and primary CRC, we download cDNA
microarrays from GEO database (No. GSE22834) and
performed supervised analysis using SAM and identified
1,067 unique genes with aberrant expression in liver
metastatic CRC compared to primary CRC. Functional

As noted above, microarray screening analysis found
that a total number of 1,067 genes were differentially

1,362 genes were differentially expressed between SW480
and SW620 cells. As shown in Figure 7A, the overlapping

differentially expressed genes between the CRC tissues
and cell lines were 97 genes; however, the overlapping
among the top 10 highest-ranking keywords between the
CRC tissues and cell lines were 6 (Figure 7A).
The differentially signaling pathways were analyzed
using the GenCLiP 2.0 online tool. As shown in Figure
7C, the histogram showing the differentially signaling
pathways between metastatic and primary CRC. The
various aberrant signaling pathways between metastatic
and primary CRC indicated that heterogeneity was present
among different tumors as well as between primary and
metastatic CRC foci. The differentially signaling pathways
between SW480 and SW620 cells were also showed in
Figure 7B.

DNA microarrays is a recent development and
application of human genome and high-throughput
technology, allow us to simultaneously examine
thousands of genes, provided a promising way to much
better understanding of CRC carcinogenesis [15–17].
The overlapping differentially expressed genes between
the CRC tissues and cell lines were rare, but the overlap
ratio among these top 10 highest-ranking keywords was
60%. These results suggested that although differentially
expressed genes are dissimilarity, the functions of these
genes are mainly similar between CRC tissues and cell
lines. To compare the biological behavior difference
between primary and metastatic CRC cells, the migration
and invasion abilities difference between SW480 and
SW620 cells were determined through transwell and
boyden chamber assays. Our findings reveal that metastatic
CRC SW620 cells have greater migration and invasion
abilities than primary SW480 cells, the relative proteins
CD44v6 and MMP-9 were upregulated, E-cadherin was
downregulated in SW620 cells. These results consistent
with Palmieri and Kubens’ experimental results [18, 19].
In present study, the immunohistochemistry results
showed that the expression level of drug resistance and
stem cell related proteins in metastatic and primary CRC
foci were different. The concordance rates of these proteins
between the lymphatic metastatic CRC foci and primary
foci were low, and there was only one protein, CD44v6,
with over 50% concordance rate. In addition, the apoptotic
and the proliferation index in lymphatic metastasis CRC
foci were decreased compared with primary foci. These
results showed that the heterogeneity at difference
expression level of drug resistance and stem cell related

DISCUSSION
Metastases cause significant recurrence and
mortality for patients with CRC, and the survival rates
with these case remain unacceptably low [1, 2, 10]. The
process of EMT often considered being the switch that
allows tumor cells to acquire the capacity to invade and
ultimately metastasize to distant sites [11, 12]. Numerous
researches have pointed out that the genetic heterogeneity
was present among different tumors as well as between
primary and metastatic cancer cells [13, 14]. However,
the biological differences between primary and metastatic
CRC, especially at difference of drug resistance is still
largely unknown. Therefore, elucidation of molecular
mechanism underlying the metastatic phenotype is critical
for the development of potential therapeutic agents for
CRC.

proteins was present between the metastatic and primary
CRC foci, suggested that biological behaviors between
metastatic and primary cells may be different. In vitro,
we found that the efflux rate of Rh123 was upregulated
in metastasis CRC SW620 cells than primary SW480
cells. According to the flow cytometry and TUNEL
staining experimental results, we found that reduction in
the proportion of apoptosis in SW620 cells induced by
5-Fu treatment were lower than that in SW480 cells. After
treated with 5-Fu, reduction in the proportion of CD133
and TERT protein expressions in SW620 cells were lower
than SW480 cells. These results indicated that metastatic
cells with such characteristics are partly responsible for
its drug resistant ability enhancing. Perhaps this explains
in part why the lower remission and higher recurrent were
happened to patients with metastasis after chemotherapy
treatment.

Analysis results from GenCLiP 2.0 suggested
that WNT pathway was involved in aberrant signaling
pathways between metastatic and primary CRC, as
well as between SW480 and SW620 cells. The main
oncoprotein in colorectal cancer is the WNT pathway
effector β-catenin, which transportation to the nucleus
and overactivation due to genic mutations in the APC,
Axin, CKI, and GSK-3β in most cases [20–25]. Aberrant
WNT signaling pathway is associated with a wide
array of tumor types and plays an important role in the
maintenance of stemness of CSCs and drug resistant
ability [26–31]. Our experimental results show that
β-catenin was upregulated and accumulated in the nuclei,
whereas E-cadherin was downregulated in SW620
compared with SW480 cells. Typically, E-cadherin and
β-catenin located at the cell membranes and constituted
intercellular junctions [32–36]. During the process of

EMT, the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex breakdown,
accompanying with β-catenin translocation into nuclei
and WNT signaling pathway over activation in CRC
[37–41]. In addition, our previous research shows that
the WNT signaling pathway plays an important role in
drug resistance in colon cancer cells by alternating the
expression level of CSC markers and drug resistance
relative proteins [42, 43]. Junlin and colleagues also
reported that the activation of β-catenin and Akt

pathways by Twist are critical for the maintenance of
EMT associated cancer stem cell-like characters [44].
In conclusion, we show for the first time that the
heterogeneity on drug resistance was present between
metastatic CRC foci and primary foci and cell lines,
suggested that the molecular pathological diagnosis and
follow-up clinical therapies for primary CRC foci may not
be justly suitable for the corresponding metastatic foci.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Datasets
The raw experimental data under accession no.
GSE22834 used in the present study, contributed from
Albert Y et al [45], is publically available in the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www. ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo). These data, which include 31 primary
CRC specimens from 30 patients (14 males and 16 females;
age range: 36 to 80; stage I/II/III/IV=1/10/11/8, diagnosed
between 2000 and 2004), and 32 CLM specimens from 31
patients (16 males and 15 females; age range: 40 to 82),
were produced by cDNA microarrays. In the present study,
using primary CRC specimens as control, the molecular
variations in CLM specimens were identified by the
GenCLiP 2.0 online tool [46] (http://ci.smu.edu.cn/).

Flow cytometry analysis of CD133 positive cell
population
Human colon adenocarcinoma SW480 and SW620
cell lines (1×106) were detached by treatment with
0.25% trypsin/EDTA and washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline. The cells were then resuspended in
100 μl of Staining Buffer containing 1% fetal bovine
serum and place on ice for 20 min to block Fc receptors.
After incubating with primary phycoerythrin antihuman
CD133 antibody (Milteny, Germany) for another 10 min
on ice in the dark, the cells were washed twice with 1
ml of ice-cold Staining Buffer and centrifuged (300×g)
for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells resuspended in 0.3 ml of 2%
formaldehyde fixation buffer were analyzed using a
FACSAriaflow cytometer and Cell Quest software
(BD Biosciences). All flow cytometry results were
obtained from two independent experiments performed
in triplicate.

Patients and tissue samples
Paraffin-embedded surgical specimens of human
primary CRC specimens and corresponding lymph-node
metastatic specimens (from Department of Pathology,
Qingyuan People’s Hospital, Jinan University) were used
for clinical tissue microarray expression profiling analysis.
We used 60 primary CRC specimens and corresponding
lymph-node metastatic specimens from 60 patients (36
males and 24 females; age range: 30 to 85; Duke stage
III/IV=43/17, diagnosed between 2005 and 2008). For
the use of these clinical materials for research purposes,
prior written informed consent and ethics approval were
obtained from all participants and the Ethics Committees
of the Qingyuan People’s Hospital, respectively.

Western blot analysis
Following treatment with different drugs for 24 h,
the cells were collected and lysed. Protein content was
measured by the BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Institute
of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) and 20 μg protein
per lane was separated by 8%-12% sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Specific
protein bands were achieved with an ECL detection
reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Anti-CD44v6 (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) dilution
was 1:1000. Anti-β-catenin (Cell Signaling Technology)
dilutions were 1:1,000. Anti-MMP-9 and anti-TERT
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) dilutions were1:500
and 1:800. Anti-EpCAM and anti-α-tubulin (Cell
Signaling Technology) dilutions were 1:500 and 1:1,000.

Chicago, IL, USA) dilutions were 1:3,000. α-tubulin
was used as a protein loading control. The images were
captured with ChemiDocTM CRS+ Molecular Imager

Cell culture and chemicals
Human colon adenocarcinoma SW480 and
SW620 cells were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Gibco, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (TBD, China)
at 37°C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. 5-Fu was
purchased from Shanghai Xudong Haipu Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd., China.

Apoptosis analysis
For the apoptosis analysis, the cells were treated
for 24 h with control or 5-Fu (50μmol/L). The cells were
measured using FACSAriaflow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
USA), and Annexin V (+) cells were counted for apoptotic
cells after Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium
iodide (FITC/PI)(BD Pharmingen, USA) double staining.
The experiment was performed in triplicate.

(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The density of the protein
band was quantitated using Quantity One software (BioRad). The experiment was performed in triplicate.

EpCAM (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA,
USA) dilutions was 1:800, and incubated overnight
at 4°C. Chromogenic detection was then done using a
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and DAB
reagents (ZSBIO). The proliferation index was analyzed
using the Cyclin D1 antibody. Staining was measured as
the percentage of positively stained nuclei in 200 tumor
cells in a consecutive field. Counting was conducted on
the most intensely stained areas. The immunostains were
scored by two pathologists (FL and SGW) blinded to the
clinical data.

Rh123 efflux assay for P-gp function
After exposed to 5-Fu for 24 h, the CRC cells were
incubated with 4 μg/ml rhodamine 123 (Rh123) (KeyGEN
Biotech. Co., Ltd, China) for 30 or 60 min at 37°C. The
fluorescence intensity of Rh123 in cells was detected by
flow cytometry.

Characterization of apoptosis morphology
in cells

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with the
SPSS13.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). Two-class Significance Analysis of Microarrays
(SAM) was used to identify genes that were
differentially expressed in 31 CRC specimens and 32
CLM specimens, as well as metastatic cells SW620 and
primary CRC cells SW480, the statistical significance
was assessed by a false discovery rate (FDR). Data
are presented as mean ± SD. One way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used for apoptosis, cell cycle
and western blot data analyses. Comparison of the
CSCs and drug resistance relative proteins between
primary CRC and colorectal lymphatic metastasis
specimens was performed with the related-samples
Wilcoxon signed rank test and Spearman’s correlation
test. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically
significant difference.

Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 3,000 cells
per well. After compound treatment, cells were fixed
using 10% buffered formalin/4% formaldehyde. Cellular
DNA fragmentation morphology was detected by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated nick end
labeling (TUNEL) staining using ApopTag red in situ kit
(Roche, AG., Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
directions. TUNEL-positive cells were visualized and
analyzed using Cellomic ArrayScan II image analysis
system (Cellomics, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA).

Transwell migration and boyden chamber
invasion assays
For the transwell migration assay, 105 cells in 100
ml of serum-free DMEM media were triplicate seeded in
each fibronectin-coated polycarbonate membrane insert in
a transwell apparatus (Corning). 600 μl of 10% NCS in
DMEM was added to the bottom chamber. SW480 and
SW620 cells were incubated at 37°C for 12 h. The inserts
were washed twice with prewarmed PBS. Cells adhered
on the lower surface were fixed with 100% methanol at
RT for 15min and stained with hematoxylin for 15min.
Cell numbers in six predetermined fields in each replicate
were counted under the microscope (Nikon ECLPSE 80i
system; ×200). All assays were independently repeated at
least for three times. Cell invasion assays were performed
as the migration assay except the transwell membrane was
precoated with 24mgml-1 Matrigel (R&D Systems) and the
cells were incubated for 24 and 18 h, respectively.
