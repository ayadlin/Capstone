ABSTRACT
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of gynecologic cancer
mortality worldwide. Platinum-based therapy is the standard first line treatment
and while most patients initially respond, resistance to chemotherapy usually
arises. Major signaling pathways frequently upregulated in chemoresistant cells and
important in the maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) include Wnt/β-catenin,
mTOR, and STAT3. The major objective of our study was to investigate the treatment
of ovarian cancer with targeted agents that inhibit these three pathways. Here we
demonstrate that niclosamide, a salicylamide derivative, and two synthetically
manufactured niclosamide analogs (analog 11 and 32) caused significant inhibition
of proliferation of two chemoresistant ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780cp20 and
SKOV3Trip2), tumorspheres isolated from the ascites of EOC patients, and cells from
a chemoresistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX). This work shows that all three
agents significantly decreased the expression of proteins in the Wnt/β-catenin, mTOR
and STAT3 pathways and preferentially targeted cells that expressed the ovarian
CSC surface protein CD133. It also illustrates the potential of drug repurposing for
chemoresistant EOC and can serve as a basis for pathway-oriented in vivo studies.

Developing more effective and durable treatments is a
significant unmet medical need in this disease context. A
subset of cells may survive first-line chemotherapy and
ultimately be responsible for the development of clinically
detectable recurrence. These cells may be cancer stem
cells (CSCs) that are resistant to primary therapy and are
responsible for the generation of progeny cancer cells [2].
Important pathways that are frequently upregulated
in CSCs are the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) was responsible
for an estimated 14,000 deaths in the United States in
2015 making it the deadliest gynecologic malignancy
[1]. Surgical resection in combination with platinum and
taxane-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for
patients with EOC. Although the majority of patients
with EOC become clinically disease-free after initial
treatment, 75% of patients ultimately recur within 5 years.

the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3
(STAT3) pathway [3, 4]. All three of these pathways
have been shown to be associated with recurrence and
development of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer [5,
6]. A well established in vitro model has been used to
replicate the behavior of CSCs, which involves plating
cells in serum-free media that contains growth factors in
low-attachment plates so that they form spheres rather
than adhere to the plate as single cells. Studies have shown
that these tumorspheres have increased expression of
ovarian CSC markers such as CD133 and ALDH1A1 [7].
When these cells are implanted into mice they are more
tumorigenic than the bulk population of tumor cells. In
order to successfully prevent ovarian cancer recurrence, it
is imperative that therapies are developed to specifically
target these chemoresistant CSCs. A therapeutic
intervention that targets both the Wnt/β-catenin and
mTOR/STAT3 pathways provides a promising approach
towards the eradication of CSCs.
The traditional drug-development process takes a
tremendous amount of time and is extremely costly with a
very high failure rate. It has been estimated that it requires
approximately a billion dollars and 10 years for a drug
to be developed and placed on the market [8]. Drugs that
have previously been used with known pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics and toxicity profiles provide an
advantage over new drug discovery. New applications
can be found for existing drugs, called drug repurposing,
which can be valuable especially in diseases such as EOC.
Niclosamide (trade name Niclocide) is a salicyclamide
derivative in the antihelminth family which has been
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
the treatment of tapeworms. This safe, inexpensive drug
has been used in humans for nearly 50 years. Several
investigators have independently performed quantitative
high-throughput screening of > 4,000 clinically approved
compounds and found niclosamide to be a potent anticancer compound [9, 10]. Screening of the NCI 60 human
tumor cell line panel identified niclosamide as an inhibitor
of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway [9]. Niclosamide is a
potent mitochondrial uncoupler which can have an effect
on cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis [9]. One criticism for
pursuing the use of niclosamide as an anti-cancer drug is
it poor water solubility (0.23 μg/mL) and poor systemic
bioavailability (~10%) [11]. Our group and others have
made efforts to develop analogs of niclosamide. Analogs
11 and 32 were both synthesized by Dr. Pui-Kai Li at
the Ohio State University in an attempt to improve the
bioavailability and solubility and potentially enhance
niclosamide’s inhibition of proliferation. We previously
described the structure and synthesis of these two
compounds, which are shown in Supplementary Table S4
[12].
In this study, we investigated the effects of
niclosamide, analog 11, and analog 32 on ovarian
cancer cells and found that niclosamide and its analogs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin, mTOR, and STAT3 pathways
in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cell lines, in cells
derived from a chemoresistant ovarian cancer patientderived xenograft (PDX model), and tumorspheres
cultured from cells isolated from the ascites of patients
with ovarian cancer. Several other groups have also
shown that niclosamide and niclosamide derivatives can
inhibit mTOR and STAT3 signaling in various tumor
types [13–19]. We previously showed that niclosamide
and its analogs were anti-proliferative and targeted the
Wnt pathway in >30 primary ovarian cancer patient
ascites samples, some of which were clinically platinum
resistant [12, 20]. In addition, we found that niclosamide
specifically decreased the stem cell marker ALHD1A1 and
the Wnt pathway surface receptor LRP6. In this current
study we demonstrate that niclosamide not only targets
the Wnt pathway, but it also targets the mTOR and the
STAT3 pathways and specifically targets CD133+ CSCs
and chemoresistant cells isolated from a PDX ovarian
cancer model.

RESULTS
Anti-proliferation effects of niclosamide and its
analogs, as single agents and in combination with
chemotherapy
Human ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780ip2 and
SKOV3ip1 along with their platinum and taxane resistant
derivatives A2780cp20 and SKOV3Trip2 were treated with
niclosamide, analog 11, or analog 32 (0.1- 4 μM) for 48
h, and cell proliferation was assessed by measuring ATP
levels using the ATPlite assay (Supplementary Figure S4).
All three agents produced similar inhibition of proliferation,
with IC50 values ranging from (0.41- 1.86 μM) (Figure 1A
and Supplementary Table S1). These values are well below
the known Cmax of niclosamide in humans of 18.34 μM [21].
Analog 11 had slightly more anti-proliferative activity than
the other two compounds for both the SKOV3ip1 parental
cell line and SKOV3Trip2 taxane resistant line, but similar
inhibition of proliferation was observed in the A2780ip2
and A2780cp20 cell lines. IC50 values for analog 32 were
similar to niclosamide in all four cell lines.
We then investigated the effects of combining
niclosamide, analog 11 or 32 with chemotherapy. The
combination of niclosamide, analog 11, or analog 32 with
carboplatin doses ranging from 50 -150 μM produced
significantly greater inhibition of proliferation than either
agent alone and statistical analysis indicated that the
combination of the IC50 dose of carboplatin (150 μM)
was synergistic with a combination index less than 1 (CI
< 1) for all 3 agents in the A2780cp20 cell line (Figure
1B). Synergy was also observed with all 3 agents in the
SKOV3ip1 and SKOV3Trip2 cell lines when combined
with the IC50 dose of carboplatin, 100 μM and 50 μM
respectively (Supplementary Figure S1). In the parental
86804

Oncotarget

A2780ip2 cell line, niclosamide and analog 32 were
synergistic with 50 μM of carboplatin, while analog 11
had an additive effect (CI = 1) (Supplementary Figure S1).
The anti-proliferative effects of niclosamide were
validated in the two chemoresistant cell lines. Niclosamide
inhibited proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent
manner. When the difference in cell proliferation between
treated and untreated cells was evaluated over a 72 h
period in the two chemoresistant cell lines, 1 μM of
niclosamide inhibited growth by 24 h and suspension of
growth persisted for 72 h (Figure 1C and Supplementary
Table S2). Niclosamide at 4 μM showed no increase in cell
number after 72 h either due to cell kill, cell cycle arrest,
or a combination of both.
In order to investigate if niclosamide and its analogs
were targeting the CD133+ population of cells specifically,
the chemoresistant A2780cp20 cells, which have a high
expression of CD133+ compared to the parental line,
were treated for 48 h with 2 μM of niclosamide, analog

11, or analog 32. At baseline, A2780cp20 cell line contains
80% CD133 + cells compared to 50-60% in the parental
A2780ip2 cell line (Supplementary Figure S2B). Analog
32 and niclosamide both caused a statistically significant
decrease in the CD133+ population with a 60-80%
reduction of CD133+ cells (Figure 1D). There was a slight
decrease in the CD133+ population after treatment with
analog 11, but this was not statistically significant. Fifty
percent of the total cells are killed with an IC50 dose of
either carboplatin or paclitaxel, but >50% of the surviving
cells still express CD133+; in contrast, niclosamide
preferentially kills this population (Figure 1D).

Inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in
ovarian cancer cell lines
In order to evaluate niclosamide’s ability to inhibit
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, we measured the nuclear
β-catenin driven transcription activation after treatment

Figure 1: Anti-proliferative effects of niclosamide, and its analogs, as single agents and in combination with
chemotherapy and expression of CD133 post treatment. A. A2780ip2, A2780cp20, SKOV3ip1, SKOV3TRip2 cancer cell lines

were treated with niclosamide, analog 11 or 32 (0.1- 4 μM) for 48 h. Level of ATP in the treated cells compared to the untreated cells were
analyzed using ATPlite assay. B. A2780cp20 cells were treated concurrently with niclosamide or analogs in combination with carboplatin
at indicated concentrations for 48 h. A combination index (CI) was calculated where CI <1 is synergistic. C. A2780cp20, SKOV3TRip2
cell lines were plated in 12 well plates and treated with niclosamide at indicated concentrations. Cell viability was measured by trypan blue
exclusion method. All experiments were repeated 3 times. D. A2780cp20 cells were treated with niclosamide or analogs (2 μM), or IC50
doses of chemotherapy for 48 h and analyzed for CD133 expression by flow cytometry. Using student’s t-test, *P < .05. All experiments
were repeated 3 times. Data are represented as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA with application of
Tukey’s post test, P < .05 for all figures in (B).

with 1μM of niclosamide for 24 h using the TOPflash
luciferase reporter assay. We observed a statistically
significant suppression of β-catenin driven transcription
activity in the presence of niclosamide in all four cell lines
(Figure 2A). This suppression was also observed in both the
parental A2780ip2 and SKOV3ip1 and the chemoresistant
A2780cp20 and SKOV3Trip2 cell lines under Wnt
stimulation (Figure 2A). Interestingly, we noted that in the
chemoresistant lines A2780cp20 and SKOV3Trip2, the
addition of Wnt3a failed to show increased activation of
β-catenin driven signaling. One explanation for this could
be that Wnt/β-catenin is already maximally upregulated in
the chemoresistant cells, and the addition of Wnt3a does
not further increase the level of nuclear β-catenin. It could
also be possible that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway regulation
of these cells is driven by other Wnt ligands and not Wnt3a
or that it is deregulated downstream of Wnt stimulation due
to other events that stabilize β-catenin.
LRP6 is an essential Wnt co-receptor for the Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway, and LRP6 phosphorylation is
critical for Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation induced
by Wnt proteins. Uncomplexed cytosolic β-catenin (free
β-catenin) can translocate to the cell nucleus and bind
transcription factors leading to the transcription of Wnt
target genes. To further evaluate niclosamide and its

analogs’ effect on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, we used
Western blot analysis to measure the transmembrane
receptor LRP6, both total and phosphorylated, and
the amount of total β-catenin. Niclosamide and its
analogs inhibited endogenous LRP6 expression and
phosphorylation in both parental A2780ip2 and platinum
resistant A2780cp20 cell lines in a dose dependent
manner (Figure 2B). We found that total β-catenin
levels in both cell lines were significantly reduced after
treatment with niclosamide, analog 11 and analog 32.
Although analogs 11 and 32 decreased the expression of
phosphorylated LRP6 and total β-catenin at the highest
concentration in both cell lines, the decrease in nuclear
β-catenin measured by TOPflash reporter assay was only
statistically significant in the A2780cp20 cell line, but not
in the parental A2780ip2 cell line (Supplementary Figure
S2A). This could be the result of the analogs’ ability to
have an enhanced effect on the more stem-like cells. While
analog 11 stimulated total β-catenin levels at 0.5 and 1μM
using Western blot analysis in the A2780cp20 cell line,
TOPflash reporter assay is a more specific measurement
of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation by measuring the
nuclear β-catenin driven transcription activation, which
showed a statistically significant decrease with 1μM of
analog 11 (Supplementary Figure S2A).

examined by western blot. All experiments were repeated 3 times. Data are represented as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed
by using student’s t-tests, * P <0.05 when niclosamide group was compared to untreated control and niclosamide with Wnt3A group was
compared to Wnt3A alone.

mTOR/STAT3 inhibition of ovarian cancer cell
lines and patient samples

demonstrated in Figure 3A, 1 μM of niclosamide inhibited
4E-BP1 and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 in both parental
A2780ip2 and chemoresistant A2780cp20 cell lines after
24 h. Analog 11 and analog 32 both inhibited mTOR
pathway proteins 4E-BP1, phospho-4E-BP1, p70S6K;
however, p(Thr389)-p70-70S6K was only consistently
inhibited at the 2 μM dose (Figure 3A).
We have previously published that niclosamide is a
potent STAT3 inhibitor in triple negative breast cancer cell

Overexpression of downstream mTOR effectors
4E-BP1 and S6K lead to poor cancer prognosis [22].
Activation of mTOR leads to the phosphorylation of
P70S6K at threonine 389. In order to evaluate the effect
of niclosamide and its analogs on the mTOR pathway,
we measured these proteins by Western blot analysis. As

plated in 6 well plates and were treated with niclosamide and analogs 11 and 32 at indicated concentrations for 24 h. Treated lysates were
examined for the levels of mTOR pathway proteins (4E-BP1, phospho-4E-BP1, p(Thr389)-P70-70S6K, p70S6K). B. Acites cells from
ovarian cancer patients were plated in 6 well plates and were treated with niclosamide at indicated concentrations for 24 h. Treated lysates
were examined for the levels of STAT3 pathway proteins (p(Tyr705)-STAT3 and STAT3) and mTOR pathway proteins (p(Thr389)-p7070SK, p70S6K, p(Ser235/236)-S6, and S6).

lines [23]. To evaluate this finding in ovarian cancer patient
samples, we measured total STAT3 and phosphorylated
STAT3 after treatment with niclosamide. Niclosamide
reduced STAT3 and mTOR downstream protein
expression in ascites cells from ovarian cancer patients.
STAT3 is phosphorylated by a kinase and translocates
to the cell nucleus where it acts as a transcription
activator. Specifically, STAT3 becomes activated after
phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 in response to specific
ligands. Western blot analysis of the phosphorylated
(Tyr705) STAT3 protein after 24 h treatment with
niclosamide (1 – 8 μM) showed a dose-response inhibition
in ovarian cancer patient ascites sample OV-15. In OV26, OV-05, OV-25 and OV-22, we used the highest dose
in an effort to see the most significant effect and the 8
μM concentration of niclosamide completely abolished
the phosphorylated (Tyr705) STAT3 protein expression
(Figure 3B). Patient sample labeling (i.e. OV- patient #)
was kept consistent with our previously published paper
that showed dose-response inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin
signaling proteins (LRP6, pLRP6, free and total β-catenin)

and 3 target genes (Axin2, survivin, and cyclin D1) [20].
In addition, the mTOR pathway proteins p(Thr389)-P7070SK and p(Ser235/236)S6 were significantly inhibited in
the patient samples (Figure 3B). Overall, niclosamide was
more consistent than analog 11 or analog 32 at inhibiting
both STAT3 and mTOR protein expression.

Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by niclosamide
To elucidate the mechanism by which niclosamide
inhibited cellular proliferation and caused cell death,
we analyzed treated cells for both cell cycle arrest by
flow cytometry and ELISA apoptosis assay. All cells
were evaluated for their phase in the cell cycle by flow
cytometry at 24 and 48 h after treatment with niclosamide.
After treating A2780cp20 cells with niclosamide (1- 4
μM), cells arrested at G1 by 24 h at a 1 μM concentration,
which was even more evident at higher concentrations
(Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure S3).
Apoptosis was determined using an ELISAapoptosis assay to detect mono- and oligonucleosomes

A2780cp20 cell line was plated in 12 well plates and treated with indicated concentrations of niclosamide. Cells were stained with PI as

48 h. B. A2780ip2, A2780cp20, SKOV3ip1, SKOV3TRip2 cancer cell lines were treated with niclosamide at indicated concentrations for

described in Materials and Methods. C. A2780ip2, A2780cp20 cell lines were treated with indicated concentrations of niclosamide. Lysates
from treated cell lines were analyzed for survivin and cyclin D1. Data are represented as mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed

DISCUSSION

released into the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells as a result
of DNA degradation. After treatment with 2 μM of
niclosamide, production of apoptotic DNA fragments was
significantly increased compared to untreated controls
in the A2780ip2, SKOV3ip1 and SKOV3Trip2 cell
lines (Figure 4B). Four μM of niclosamide was required
to see significant levels of apoptotic DNA fragments
in the A2780cp20 chemoresistant cell line. This data
suggests niclosamide is causing cell cycle arrest at lower
concentrations and causing senescence and cell kill by
apoptosis at higher concentrations. However, necrosis and
autophagy, due to mTOR inhibition, could also account
for cell kill [15].
Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the
effect of niclosamide and its analogs on the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway target genes that affect cell cycle and apoptosis,
namely cyclin D1 and survivin. At a concentration as
low as 1μM of niclosamide, the proto-oncogene cyclin
D1, which controls transition from G1 to S phase, is
decreased in both A2780ip2 and A2780cp20 (Figure 4C).
Protein levels of survivin, a protein that helps the cell to
evade apoptosis, is dramatically reduced in both parental
A2780ip2 and chemoresistant A2780cp20 cells at 2 μM
(Figure 4C). A potential mechanism for cell cycle arrest
and cell kill is the decrease in cyclin D1 and survivin.
Similar results were obtained with analogs 11 and 32.

Niclosamide, an FDA approved anthelmintic
drug, is an inhibitor of Wnt co-receptor LRP6 and
suppresses both the Wnt/β-catenin pathways and the
mTOR/STAT3 pathway. Niclosamide has been shown
to be anti-proliferative against prostate, colorectal, lung,
breast, and ovarian cancers, and myelogenous leukemia
by inhibiting multiple pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, Notch,
NF-kB, mTOR, and STAT3) and inducing mitochondrial
uncoupling [13, 16, 25–33]. In ovarian cancer, it has
been shown to specifically kill CSCs [20, 23]. However,
niclosamide exerts its antiparasitic activity in the intestinal
lumen and has poor bioavailability, which limits its
potential application as an anticancer agent. Niclosamide
is a nitroaromatic coumpound, and the presence of a
nitro group (NO2) in a compound can induce metabolic
instability and serous toxicity. In the present study, we use
two niclosamide analogs that we designed, synthesized,
and biologically evaluated. In analog 11, we replaced the
NO2 group in the anilide portion with another electron
withdrawing group, trifluoromethyl (CF3). The CF3
group, which is widely used in current drug design, is
metabolically more stable than the NO2 group. In analog
32, the salicyl portion was modified. Both analogs
showed similar biological activity as niclosamide. They
suppressed LRP6 expression, inhibited both Wnt/β-catenin
and mTOR/STAT3 signaling in ovarian cancer ascites cells
and chemoresistant cell lines, and displayed potent in vitro
anti-proliferative effects. This data suggests that the novel
niclosamide analogs are promising candidates for cancer
therapy.
Interactions between the Wnt/β-catenin and STAT3/
mTOR signaling pathways play an important role in
ovarian carcinogenesis [34, 35]. There is significant crosstalk between these signaling pathways. The binding of a
Wnt ligand to one of the transmembrane receptors LRP5/6
or Frizzled leads to the stabilization and translocation
of active β-catenin in the cytoplasm. Stabilization and
nuclear translocation of β-catenin leads to transcriptional
activation of several important TCF/LEF target genes
including survivin and cyclin D1 which are also regulated
by mTOR signaling [36, 37]. Prior studies have shown that
activated β-catenin causes enhanced STAT3 mRNA and
protein expression [38]. In addition, studies have shown
that activation of the STAT3 pathway leads to nuclear
accumulation of β-catenin, causing increased levels of
survivin and cyclin D1 [39]. Survivin is an oncogene
that allows cells to recover from DNA damage and may
contribute to chemotherapy resistance and help cells evade
apoptosis. Cyclin D1 (CCND1), the proto-oncogene,
is a cell-cycle regulator, which controls transition from
G1 to S phase and has been shown to be correlated
with platinum resistance. Given the high frequency of
developing platinum resistance in ovarian cancer, it is
imperative that we find treatments that target pathways

Anti-proliferative effects of niclosamide and
analogs 11 and 32 in a PDX model
To confirm our cell line and previously published
ascites tumorsphere in vitro observations, the effect of
niclosamide treatment was evaluated in cells dissociated
from an in vivo PDX model. A chemoresistant PDX model
was created by serial chemotherapy treatments until the
xenograft became resistant. Patient 127 had a histology
of papillary serous adenocarcinoma and, as previously
described in Dobbin et al, the histology of the tumor was
maintained for 6 generations and a significant increase in
the CSC markers ALDH1A1 and CD133 were seen in the
PDX treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel for 4 weeks
[24]. After dissociating cells from both the chemoresistant
and the chemosensitive (parental) PDX model and plating
cells both in tissue culture treated adherent conditions
and in low attachment plates with stem-cell media, we
treated all 4 types of cells with niclosamide, analog 11, or
analog 32. In adherent conditions, the PDX#127-Resistant
(127R) and PDX#127-Sensitive (127S) cells had similar
sensitivity to all 3 agents (Figure 5A). When cells were
grown in tumorsphere conditions, both niclosamide
and analog 11 caused significantly more inhibition of
proliferation (IC50 < 0.1) to the 127R chemoresistant cells
compared to the 127S cells (IC50 < 1) (Figure 5B). This
assay confirms our prior observations that niclosamide is
able to preferentially target chemoresistant cells.

that lead to chemotherapy resistance. Mechanistically, we
found that niclosamide and two novel niclosamide analogs
inhibit the production of both the oncogene survivin and
the proto-oncogene cyclin D1, which both contribute to
chemoresistance.
About 2% of ovarian cancer cells survive initial
chemotherapy [40]. These CSCs have increased
tumorgenicity, lead to recurrence, metastatic spread and
chemoresistance. Wnt/β-catenin, mTOR, and STAT3
pathways have all been implicated in CSCs. ALDH1A1
and CD133 are two well established ovarian cancer
stem cell markers. Both niclosamide and analog 32
preferentially killed the CD133+ population, which
demonstrates that these agents could specifically target the
CSCs. Niclosamide’s ability to target the chemoresistant
CSCs was also seen in the PDX model, where more
effective inhibition of proliferation was seen in the cells
dissociated from the chemoresistant PDX model and
grown in stem cell media on low attachment plates.
Andrews et al. described a study where human
volunteers received a single oral dose of 2,000 mg
of carbonyl-14c-labeled niclosamide and the serum
concentration was measured and found to be 0.25 - 6.0
μg/ml, which is equivalent to 0.7-18 μM [21]. These

values are below the known Cmax of niclosamide in
humans of 18 μM. We show in the present study that
niclosamide and analogs 11 and 32 inhibited ovarian
cancer cell proliferation in vitro with IC50 values between
0.41 and 1.86 μM. Anti-proliferative effects were seen
in established ovarian cancer cell lines, A2780ip2 and
SKOV3ip1, as well as the chemoresistant A2780cp20 and
SKOV3Trip2 cell lines, which are enriched for CSCs [41,
42]. Niclosamide and its analogs were able to reverse the
resistance of A2780cp20 to carboplatin, suggesting that
in women with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer these
agents could reverse chemoresistance.
ATPlite assay was initially performed to evaluate
the cytotoxicity of niclosamide and its analogs, but the
ATP assay is an indirect measure of cell number based
on constant ATP. The results could have been confounded
by niclosamide’s well known effect on oxidative
phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Therefore, we
used the trypan blue exclusion test in an effort to more
accurately measure inhibition of proliferation. In order to
better understand the anti-proliferative effect of the drugs,
cell cycle arrest assay by flow cytometry and apoptosis
ELISA assays were performed. Cell cycle arrest was
seen at the G1 phase, which could be partially due to the

Figure 5: Anti-proliferative effect of niclosamide and analogs 11 and 32 on PDX mouse model cells. PDX models 127 R

(resistant) and 127 S (sensitive) were dissociated to single cell suspension and plated in 96 well plates. A. PDX cells were plated in tissue
culture treated plates in 10% FBS + DMEM media. B. PDX cells were plated in low attachment plates with serum free x-vivo media with
added supplements to promote stem cell growth. Cells were treated with niclosamide or analogs at increasing concentrations. Viability of
cells was analyzed by ATPlite assay. All experiments were repeated 3 times. Data are represented as mean ± SD.

decrease in the Wnt/β-catenin target gene, cyclin D1.
While some amount of apoptosis was observed, this could
be concentration dependent, contributing to only a small
fraction of the biological response. The ATP level changes
in the different cell types is likely a result of cell cycle
arrest rather than cell kill.
Clinical trials are evaluating mTOR inhibitors,
Wnt inhibitors, and STAT3 inhibitors in ovarian cancer
and other solid tumors. Unfortunately, despite biological
rationale and encouraging activity in preclinical models,
trials of mTOR inhibitors in EOC have demonstrated
disappointing results [43]. The Wnt/β-catenin and STAT3/
mTOR pathways interact with each other and a number
of other intracellular signaling networks, allowing for
treatment escape when any single pathway inhibitor is
used. Given the cross-talk between pathways and the
adaptive capacity of cancer cells to evade targeted therapy,
drug combinations are increasingly being investigated to
abrogate both primary and acquired resistance to pathway
specific targeted therapy. There has been evidence that
aberrant expression of the Wnt pathway sensitizes cancer
cells to an mTOR inhibitor; therefore, the use of a drug
that targets both pathways would be even more effective
than a single pathway inhibitor. Similarly, evasion from
mTOR pathway inhibition could be due to activation and
upregulation of the STAT3 pathway. The downside to
multiple drug combinations is that these regimens can be
toxic and difficult to simultaneously administer. A single
agent which targets multiple pathways and has an existing
safety profile, such as niclosamide is promising.
Drug repurposing is an emerging approach
for identifying new indications for existing drugs.
Niclosamide is an example where drug repurposing
has uncovered an existing drug that targets molecular
pathways involved in carcinogenesis. Niclosamide is
well-tolerated in humans and an oral dose of 2,000 mg of
niclosamide reaches blood concentrations in humans that
caused significant cancer cell anti-proliferative activity in
chemoresistant cells [21]. Additional in vivo studies need
to be performed to further evaluate the bioavailability and
anti-tumor effects of analog 11 and analog 32.
Currently, niclosamide is being evaluated in a
clinical trial with enzalutamide in treating patients with
androgen receptor positive, castration-resistant, metastatic
prostate cancer (NCT02532114). In addition, there are two
clinical trials registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov for the
treatment of colon cancer by niclosamide (NCT02687009,
NCT02519582) but neither are open yet for participant
recruitment. Our findings suggest that niclosamide has
antitumor activity for ovarian CSCs through the inhibition
of multiple altered cellular pathways associated with
metastasis and cancer recurrence. The observation that
niclosamide can target the Wnt, mTOR and STAT3
pathways and reverse platinum resistance, provides
compelling evidence to consider clinical studies with
niclosamide in patients with ovarian cancer. In conclusion,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

niclosamide has a novel mechanism as an antineoplastic
agent that should be evaluated in ovarian cancer patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and cell culture
Niclosamide was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) and dissolved in DMSO to create a 4.8
mM stock solution, which was stored at 4°C. Analogs
11 and 32 were synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. PuiKai Li at The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH),
dissolved in DMSO and stored at concentrations of 10 mM
at -20°C. A schematic is shown in Figure 1 of the Haygood
et al. manuscript [12]. Carboplatin was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), dissolved in water at
concentration of 25 mM, and stored at 4°C. Paclitaxel was
purchased from UAB hospital pharmacy.
The ovarian cancer cell lines A2780ip2, A2780cp20,
and SKOV3TRip2 were acquired courtesy of Dr. Charles
N Landen. SKOV3ip1 was acquired from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manasses, VA). The cell lines
were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Fowery
Branch, GA). A2780cp20 (platinum- and taxane-resistant),
SKOV3TRip2 (taxane-resistant), were generated by
sequential exposure to increasing concentrations of
chemotherapy [44]. SKOV3TRip2 was maintained with
the addition of 150 ng/ml of paclitaxel. All cell lines were
routinely screened for Mycoplasma species (GenProbe
detection kit; Fisher, Itasca, IL) with experiments
performed at 70–80% confluent cultures. Purity of cell
lines was confirmed with STR genomic analysis, and
only cells less than 20 passages from stocks were used in
experiments.

Specimen collection and processing
Under IRB approval at UAB, all patients who
were suspected to have ovarian cancer and scheduled to
undergo surgery were consented for this study. Ascites
fluid was collected at the time of laparotomy, diagnostic
laparoscopy, or paracentesis. Cells were isolated from the
ascites fluid via centrifugation at an initial 1000 rpm × 5
minutes, with serial spins at lower speeds (900–500 rpm),
and finally at 400 rpm to remove red blood cells. Cell
pellets were collected and washed in PBS, plated in ultralow-attachment T-75 cm2 flasks (Corning Costar, Corning,
NY) and incubated in X-vivo media (Lonza, Walkersville,
MD) supplemented with 5 μg/mL insulin, and 20 ng/mL
epidermal growth factor (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) in
37 °C atmosphere and 5% CO2. Cells were cultured for
24 – 48 h and tumorspheres were then collected and stored
at 10% DMSO and FBS for future analysis. In all samples,
a board-certified gynecologic pathologist confirmed the
cells to be ovarian cancer cells. PDX models 127S and
86811

Oncotarget

127R were developed in the laboratory of Dr. Landen.
The PDX tissue was implanted in SCID mice. Tumors
were harvested after reaching 15 mm x15 mm and were
dissociated using Miltenyi Biotec Inc.(San Diego, CA)
tissue homogenizer and tissue dissociation kits according
to manufacturer’s mouse tumor dissociation protocol.
Dissociated tumors cells were plated in 96 well plates
and analyzed by inhibition of proliferation assays after
niclosamide or analog treatments.

Randall Moon, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid,
NY). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine TM
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in Opti-MEM (Gibco/
Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. After 6
h, cells were treated with 1 μM niclosamide, analog 11,
or analog 32 and assayed for luciferase activity with or
without Wnt3a ligand 24 h post-treatment. Luciferase
activity was measured using a Turner 20/20 luminometer
(Promega, Madison, WI) and was normalized to the total
protein concentration as reported previously [23]. The
luciferase activity was normalized to untreated control
and represented as the mean ± SE for a minimum of 3
replicates. Recombinant Human Wnt-3a Protein (100 ng/
ml) R&D Systems Inc. Minneapolis, MN (Catalog #5036WN-010) was used to stimulate β-catenin driven Wnt
signaling.

Viability assays
Cells from ovarian cancer cell lines were were
plated in 96 well plates, 2000 cells per well, and exposed
to increasing concentrations of niclosamide, analog 11,
or analog 32 alone or in combination with carboplatin
in triplicate. The cells were lysed after 48 h and assessed
for viability by using ATPlite luminescence-based
assay (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. For the trypan blue exclusion
method, ovarian cancer cell lines were seeded in 6 well
plates at 8000 cells / well and treated with increasing
concentrations of niclosamide. The cells were harvested
at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h and were counted for live cells.

Cell cycle analysis
For cell cycle analysis, cells were treated with
vehicle, 1μM, 2 μM and 4 μM doses of niclosamide for 48
h, trypsinized, and fixed in 100% ethanol overnight. The
dead floating cells were also collected and combined with
live cells for staining. Cells were then centrifuged, washed
in PBS, and re-suspended in PBS containing 0.1% Triton
X-100 (v/v), 200 μg/mL DNase-free RNase A and 20 μg/
mL propidium iodide (PI). PI fluorescence was assessed
by flow cytometry and the percentage of cells in G0/G1, S
and G2/M phases was calculated by the cell cycle analysis
module for Flow Cytometry Analysis Software (FlowJo
v.7.6.1, Ashland, OR).

Western blot analysis
Cells from ovarian cancer cell lines or tumorspheres
from ascites cells were seeded 1 million per well in 6 well
plates and treated with niclosamide, analog 11, and analog
32 at the concentrations of 0.5 μM, 1 μM, 2 μM. Following
24 h, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and PMSF.
Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Immunoblot analysis was
carried out by standard techniques previously described
[12]. Equal quantities of protein were subjected to SDS–
PAGE under reducing conditions. Following transfer to
immobilon-P membrane, successive incubations with
anti-phosphorylated-LRP6, anti-LRP6, anti-total and
free β-catenin, anti-survivin, anti-cyclin D1,4E-BP1,
phosphor 4E-BP1, STAT-3, phosphor STAT-3, 70S6K,
phospho70S6K, S6, phosphor S6 or anti-actin, and
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
were carried out for 60 –120 minutes at room temperature
(Supplementary Table S3). The immunoreactive proteins
were quantified using the ECL system (PerkinElmer).
Films showing immunoreactive bands were scanned by
Kodak Digital Science DC120 Zoom Digital Camera
(Kodak, Rochester, NY).

Apoptosis detection
Apoptosis was assessed with cell death detection
ELISA kit purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Cells were treated with vehicle, 1μM, 2 μM and 4μM
of niclosamide for 48 h. The spent medium containing
floating cells was saved and kept on ice. The adherent
cells were collected by gentle trypsinization and were
combined with the floaters for pelleting by centrifugation.
After gentle lysis of the cells with the buffer provided with
the detection kit, the cell lysate was used for the ELISA
test. The results were normalized by the protein content
obtained from parallel plates with the cells being lysed
using the buffer as described above for Western blotting.
Apoptosis was detected by presence of histone associated
DNA fragments that can be found in cell cytoplasm
several hours before plasma membrane breakdown.

CD133 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines

TOPflash luciferase reporter assay

A2780cp20 cells were harvested after 48 h of
treatment with niclosamide, analog 11, or analog 32 at 2
μM, or paclitaxel 70 nM, Carboplatin 380 μM. Cells were
stained with CD133 antibody for 30 min on ice and were
analyzed for CD133 expression by flow cytometry.

Cells from ovarian cancer cell lines were seeded
40,000 per 50 μL in 96 well plates. Following 24
h, cells were transfected with 200 ng of TCF/LEF
luciferase reporter (TOPFlash) (plasmid courtesy of Dr.

Statistical significance for TOPflash, cell cycle
analysis, and ELISA were determined by Student's
t-test and P < 0.05 was considered significant. To test
differences in treatment effects, ANOVAs and Tukey tests
were performed. In cases when comparisons had to be
made for greater than two groups, ANOVAs were run. We
followed with Tukey tests to compare the means of every
treatment to the means of every other treatment to identify
differences between any two means. Calculations were
performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA).
The IC50 (half maximum inhibitory concentration)
was defined as the log10 of the niclosamide or analog
concentration producing 50% reduction in ATP levels (in
counts per second) compared with the untreated ascites
or cells. Cell viability was measured using a ratio of ATP
levels for treated tumorspheres or cell lines to untreated
controls (percent control). The combination index (CI) for
the dose–effect relationship of niclosamide or the analogs
and carboplatin were calculated based on the multiple
drug-effect equation of Chou–Talalay for calculation of
synergy [45, 46]. CI = DA/ICx,A + DB/ICX,B where ICX,A
and ICX,B are concentrations of drugs producing X %
inhibition for each respective drug alone, and DA and DB
are concentrations of each drug in the mixture that yield
X % inhibition. The CI curve or modified isobologram is
generated by plotting CI vs. X, ranging from 0 to 100%.
Drug interactions are readily identified at any level of
inhibition. The resulting CI theorem offers quantitative
definition for additive effect (CI = 1), synergism (CI <
1), and antagonism (CI > 1). The quantitative diagnostic
plot was generated with Calcusyn software version 2.0
(Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). All data represents an average
of at least four replicates. Error bars represent mean ± SE
as indicated in the figure legends.
