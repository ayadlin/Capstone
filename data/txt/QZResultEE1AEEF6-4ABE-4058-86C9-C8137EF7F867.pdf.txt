Abstract
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment usurps host antitumor
immunity by multiple mechanisms including interference with the Notch system,
which is important for various metazoan cell fate decisions and hematopoietic cell
differentiation and function. We observed that treatment with the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib in mice bearing various solid tumors resulted in an upregulated
expression of various Notch signaling components in lymphoid tissues, thereby
increasing CD8+T-lymphocyte IFNγ secretion and expression of effector molecules,
perforin and granzyme B, as well as the T-box transcription factor eomesodermin.
Bortezomib also neutralized TGFβ-mediated suppression of IFNγ and granzyme B
expression in activated CD8+T-cells. Of note, bortezomib reversed tumor-induced
downregulation of Notch receptors, Notch1 and Notch2, as well as increased the levels
of cleaved Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and downstream targets Hes1 and Hey1
in tumor-draining CD8+T-cells. Moreover, bortezomib promoted CD8+T-cell nuclear
factor-κB (NFκB) activity by increasing the total and phosphorylated levels of the IκB
kinase and IκBα as well as the cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of phosphorylated p65.
Even when we blocked NFκB activity by Bay-11-7082, or NICD cleavage by γ-secretase
inhibitor, bortezomib significantly increased expression of Notch Hes1 and Hey1
genes as well as perforin, granzyme B and eomesodermin in activated CD8+T-cells.
Data suggest that bortezomib can rescue tumor-induced dysfunction of CD8+T-cells
by its intrinsic stimulatory effects promoting NICD-NFκB crosstalk. These findings
provide novel insights on using bortezomib not only as an agent to sensitize tumors
to cell death but also to provide lymphocyte-stimulatory effects, thereby overcoming
immunosuppressive actions of tumor on anti-tumor T-cell functions.

promoted expression of T cell activation and effector
molecules. These bortezomib-mediated T cell effects were
associated with increased crosstalk between Notch and
NFκB signaling pathways important for T cell cytolytic
function. Findings suggest that bortezomib, in addition to
its established role in sensitizing tumors to cell death, can
provide T cell stimulatory effects. Therapeutic restoration
of lymphocytic Notch signaling and effector function
could enhance anti-tumor immune surveillance following
a carefully optimized bortezomib regimen, which could
break tumor resistance to cytolysis and overcome tumorassociated immunosuppression.

a crucial role in several biological processes such as
embryogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, as well
as immune cell differentiation and function [1-7].
Dysregulation of Notch signaling can thus lead to several
hematological diseases [8-15]. Notch signaling is triggered
by receptor-ligand interactions between juxtaposed
neighboring cells. The sequential proteolytic cleavage of
the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) by A-DisintegrinAnd-Metalloproteinase (ADAM) at the S2 site followed by
the cleavage at the S3 site by γ-secretase releases NICD,
which then translocates to the nucleus for interaction
with the transcriptional regulator RBP-Jκ, otherwise
known as CSL (“CBF-1, Suppressor of Hairless, Lag-2,”
after its mammalian, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis
elegans orthologues) to initiate transcription of its target
genes such as Hes1 and Hey1 [16-18]. Moreover, NICD
can interact with nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) in T cells by
competing with IκBα, thus facilitating NFκB retention
in the nucleus [19]. Evidence is emerging to support a
functional crosstalk between Notch and NFκB signaling
pathways in T cells [20-22]. Notch and NFκB activities
are critical for the maturation of CD4+CD8+ thymocytes
[23, 24]. It has also been reported that an increase in NFκB
p65 protein levels enhances Notch-mediated activation of
the Hes1 promoter [25]. However, interaction between
both signaling pathways is intriguing since NFκB can
exert antagonistic or synergistic effects depending on the
context of other cellular communication pathways.
We reported that tumor downregulates the crucial
Notch signaling to suppress T cell effector function
[26]. Recently, we observed that treatment with the
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BZB) in mice bearing
different types of solid tumors results in increased CD8+
T lymphocyte IFNγ secretion and expression of the
effector molecules perforin and granzyme B as well as
the transcription factor eomesodermin by modulating
Notch signaling. Bortezomib is an FDA-approved drug
for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell
lymphoma [27-34], and we showed that it can sensitize
various mouse and human solid tumor cells to apoptosis
by upregulating caspase-8 activity [35, 36]. However, the
effects of bortezomib on various immune functions are not
clear. Both immune stimulatory and suppressive effects
of bortezomib on immune cells have been cited [37-44].
Using murine renal and mammary solid tumors expressing
a low-avidity model antigen hemagglutinin (HA) [45], or
a lung fibrosarcoma expressing human Ras and mutant
human p53 as xenogeneic antigens [46], we investigated
the effects of bortezomib on the lymphocyte expression of
activation and effector molecules during an endogenous
anti-tumor T cell response in tumor-bearing mice and
explored their underlying mechanisms.
Results show that bortezomib can rescue tumorinduced downregulation of Notch in lymphocytes while
enhancing their immune effector function. In particular,

RESULTS
Bortezomib treatment enhances the expression of
CD8+ T cell activation and effector molecules in
tumor-bearing mice
Anti-tumor cytolytic activity of T lymphocytes
(CTL) is an important determinant for tumor
immunosurveillance and lysis. Given conflicting reports
implicating suppressive and stimulatory effects of the
proteosome inhibitor bortezomib on immune cells [3744], in this study, we carefully investigated the effects of
bortezomib on the effector function of CTLs in tumorbearing mice. We established subcutaneous tumors of
breast adenocarcinoma (4T1HA) and renal carcinoma
(RencaHA) that present a defined low-avidity epitope
of immunogenic antigen hemagglutinin (HA) [45], as
well as lung fibrosarcoma (D459) that expresses human
Ras and mutant human p53 as xenogeneic antigens
[46], in syngeneic wild type (WT) Balb/c mice for 2
weeks before administering bortezomib intravenously
at a tumor therapeutic dose of 1 mg/kg body weight,
optimized by us previously [35], which could roughly be
correlated to a transient 20 nM concentration on the basis
of the observation that a mouse of 20-25 g weight has
approximately a blood volume of about 1.5 ml. Four hours
after the last bortezomib treatment, single cell suspensions
of spleen or lymph nodes (LN) were analyzed. We were
intrigued by a reversal of tumor-induced downregulation
of effector genes perforin, granzyme B and eomesodermin
in the spleens and LN of tumor-bearing mice treated with
bortezomib (Figure 1). Similar effect was observed on
the expression of effector molecules in purified CD8+ T
cells from the pooled spleen and LN of 4T1HA tumorbearing mice treated with bortezomib (Figure 2A), which
also showed increased expression of the high-affinity IL-2
receptor α-chain, CD25, along with increased intracellular
secretion of IFNγ (Figure 2B). We noted that CD8+ T cells
following bortezomib treatment in tumor-bearing mice
maintained expression of CD44, a late T cell activation
marker indicative of effector-memory T cells (Figure 2B).

Bortezomib modulates Notch status in lymphoid
organs of tumor-bearing mice

We also assessed whether bortezomib can
neutralize the suppression of T cell cytolytic molecule
expression mediated in the tumor microenvironment
by the immunosuppressive cytokine TGFβ via the
Smad-ATF1 pathway [47]. Purified CD8+ T cells were
stimulated with CD3 and CD28 antibodies in vitro for 24
or 48 h in the presence or absence of TGFβ followed by
a 4 h bortezomib treatment. Apparently, TGFβ-mediated
suppression of IFNγ and granzyme B expression in
activated CD8+ T cells was significantly neutralized by
bortezomib treatment (Figure 3). These observations
suggest that bortezomib treatment has a stimulatory
effect on T cell function by enhancing the expression of
activation and effector molecules, which has a potential to
counteract T cell immunosuppression.

In an effort to understand the mechanisms
underlying the bortezomib-stimulated enhancement of T
cell functional molecules, we investigated the effects of
the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib on Notch signaling
in lymphocytes of tumor-bearing mice. Mice established
with subcutaneous tumors of breast 4T1HA, kidney
RencaHA, or lung D459 tumor cells for 2 weeks were
treated with BZB (1 mg/kg body weight). Four hours
after bortezomib treatment, single cell suspensions of
spleen, LN and thymus were analyzed. We observed
that tumor-induced decrease in the expression of Notch
receptors, Notch1, Notch2, Notch3 and Notch4, as well as

Bortezomib administration selectively modulates
Notch1/2 signaling in CD8+ T cells of tumorbearing mice

ligands Dll1, Dll4 and Jagged1 in splenocytes of 4T1HA
and RencaHA tumor-bearing mice could be reversed by
treatment with bortezomib (Figure 4). Similar results
were observed in D459 tumor-bearing mice (data not
shown). Hes1, Hey1 and Deltex1 are the key targets
downstream of Notch receptor engagement. Interestingly,
bortezomib reversed the tumor-induced downregulation
of these Notch cascade genes in the spleen and LN of
4T1HA (Figure 5A), RencaHA (Figure 5B) and D459
(Figure 5C) tumor-bearing mice. We also observed
similar effects of bortezomib on Notch cascade genes in
the thymus of WT mice bearing different tumor models
(Supplementary Figure S1). We further confirmed these
results in Cln4 TCR-transgenic mice overexpressing
a population of CD8+ T cells that reacts specifically
to a low-avidity epitope IYSTVASSL on the model
antigen hemagglutinin [45] expressed on tumor cells,
RencaHA and 4T1HA. TCR-HA Cln4 mice also showed
a remarkably increased expression of Notch genes in both
spleen and LN following bortezomib treatment (Figure
6). These observations suggest that bortezomib has a
significant bearing on the Notch receptor-ligand profile
in lymphoid tissues as well as on Notch downstream
signaling in immune cells, whereby it can reverse tumorinduced immune suppression.

We next assessed whether the restoration of Notch
signaling by bortezomib evident in lymphoid organs of
tumor-bearing mice is reflected in the Notch profile of
endogenous CD8+ T cells, the major cytolytic cells in
antigen-specific anti-tumor immune response. Unlike
Notch receptor expression in total splenocytes and LN
cells (Figure 4), in purified CD8+ T cells bortezomib
selectively upregulated receptor levels of Notch1 and
Notch2 (Figure 7A), with no significant changes in Notch3
and Notch4 receptors (data not shown). This indicated a
differential effect by bortezomib on Notch receptors in
CD8+ T cells. Further, in the tumor-draining LN (TDLN),
tumor-specific Vβ8.1/2+ CD8+ T cells representing a
frequency of 8-10% (data not shown) showed increased
expression of the surface receptor and mRNA of Notch1
and Notch2 following bortezomib treatment (Figure
7B and 7C). Analysis of the expression of downstream
Notch target genes Hes1 and Hey1 in the TDLN showed
similar effect (Figure 7D). We also analyzed the posttranscriptional protein levels of Notch receptors and target
gene products in CD8+ T cells purified from the pooled
spleen and LN of control and 4T1HA tumor-bearing WT
mice treated with bortezomib. A significant upregulation
of protein levels of Notch1 and Notch2 receptors (Figure
7E), and Hes1 and Hey1 products (Figure 7F) was
observed in bortezomib-treated group when compared
with tumor alone group. These observations suggest that

different doses (10-20 nM) for 4 h similar to our in
vivo treatment regimen. Results show that bortezomib
treatment upregulated the protein expression of NICD
in the cytoplasmic fraction of CD8+ T cells in a dosedependent manner, with a pronounced increase in the
nuclear levels of NICD (Figure 8A). We are not clear
whether there is any contribution of nuclear translocation
of NICD in the observed increase in the nuclear fraction of
NICD. Increased Hes1 protein was also observed in CD8+
T cells following bortezomib treatment (Figure 8B). We
then assessed the role of NFκB activation in bortezomibinduced effects on Notch signaling. Treatment of CD8+ T
cells from naïve mice with bortezomib (10 or 20 nM; 4h)
showed a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation

Bortezomib facilitates crosstalk between NICD
and NFκB activity
We next investigated the mechanisms of how
bortezomib activates Notch and causes upregulation of
effector molecules in T cells. Two downstream pathways
of Notch signaling that can affect T cell function are
mediated via Notch intracellular domain and NFκB.
We tested the roles of these pathways in purified CD8+
T cells that were treated in vitro with bortezomib at

CD28 agonist antibodies. Results show that both Hes1
and Hey1 mRNA were significantly decreased in CD8+ T
cells when activated in presence of Bay 11, confirming the
role of NFκB in Notch signaling (Figure 9C). Moreover,
treatment with bortezomib significantly abrogated the
effect of Bay 11. We observed a remarkably increased
expression of Hes1 and Hey1 following bortezomib
treatment in presence of Bay 11 both in activated CD8+
T cells as well as in naïve CD8+ T cells (Figure 9C and
9D). These results suggest that bortezomib has an intrinsic
ability to increase the levels of NICD and phosphorylation
of intermediaries such as IKK, IκBα and p65 in CD8+ T
cells, thereby facilitating a crosstalk between NICD and
NFκB activity.

of NFκB p65 in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions
(Figure 9A) as well as an induction of IKKα/β and IκBα
phosphorylation (Figure 9B). The IKK kinase complex is
the core element of the NFκB cascade, essentially made
of two kinases (IKKα and IKKβ) and a regulatory subunit,
NEMO/IKKγ. Depending on the activating signal and
the cell type, NFκB activation can be mediated by the
canonical IKKβ and NEMO, or the noncanonical IKKα
pathways. Although from our data it is not clear which
IKK subunit is involved, a clear IκBα phosphorylation
and nuclear upregulation of p65, thus suggesting
enhanced NFκB activation, is evident. To further dissect
the mechanism, we tested the effect of bortezomib (10
nM; 4 h) on CD8+ T cells that were pre-incubated for 24
h with a compound Bay-11-7082 (Bay 11), which is an
irreversible inhibitor of IKKα, with or without CD3 and

Bortezomib-mediated enhancement of effector
molecules in T cells is linked to Notch signaling

h. Indeed, bortezomib upregulated mRNA expression of
Notch Hes1 and Hey1 genes as well as eomesodermin,
granzyme B and perforin in CD3/CD28-stimulated CD8+
T cells in presence of GSI, while treatment with GSI alone
significantly reduced the expression of these molecules
(Figure 10B and 10C). Noticeably, bortezomib was able
to upregulate the expression of T cell effector molecules
in the presence of GSI, albeit not to the untreated levels.
Altogether, these results, schematically presented
in Figure 11, demonstrate that bortezomib treatment
has a stimulatory effect on T cell effector function. This
is mediated by elevated Notch1/2 receptor expression
(Figure 7) and downstream Notch-NFκB crosstalk
following bortezomib’s direct effects on the accumulation
of cytoplasmic and nuclear NICD (Figure 8), increased
phosphorylation of IKKs, IκBα, and p65 (Figure 9) along
with increased expression of Notch genes Hes1 and Hey1
and T-box transcription factors eomesodermin (Figure 2,
6 and 9) and T-bet (data not shown). Thus, it is clear that
a low-dose bortezomib treatment tested in this study can
enhance anti-tumor CD8+ T cell function by promoting
Notch-NFκB crosstalk, which has a potential to neutralize
T cell immunosuppression by tumor.

To further understand the mechanisms underlying
bortezomib’s influence on Notch activation and
enhancement of effector molecules in T cells, we
performed an experiment in which LN cells were isolated
from WT mice, which were established with 4T1HA
tumors for 2 weeks and where an endogenous HA-specific
T cell response was expected to be going on. The LN
cells ex vivo were pre-treated with γ-secretase inhibitor
(GSI; 500 nM) for 1 h, before treating with bortezomib
(10 nM) for another 4 h. Analysis of mRNA expression in
LN cells revealed that bortezomib significantly increased
the levels of Notch genes Hes1 and Hey1 even in the
presence of GSI (Figure 10A). We also evaluated the
cell-specific effect of bortezomib treatment on Notch
genes and T cell effector molecules in an in vitro set-up
where we stimulated purified CD8+ T cells from naïve
mice with CD3 and CD28 antibodies (1µg/ml) for 24
h in presence of γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI; 500 nM)
followed by treatment with bortezomib (10 nM) for 4

DISCUSSION

cells and their relevance for T cell activation and effector
function. Primary Notch targets include two families
of transcriptional repressors, hairy and enhancer-ofsplit-related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) such as Hes
and Hey. Deltex1 is another known Notch gene that is
considered a transcriptional target of nuclear factor of
activated T cells (NFAT) to promote T cell anergy [57].
We show that bortezomib administration to naïve or
tumor-bearing mice upregulates mRNA expression of
Hes1 and Hey1 and their protein products. However, no
major change in Deltex1 expression was observed. Thus,
bortezomib appears to enhance Notch activation in CD8+
T cells via upregulation of Notch1 and Notch 2 and their
downstream Hes1 and Hey1 genes.
Notch1 has been reported to bind to the promoters
of T-box transcription factor eomesodermin as well as
perforin and granzyme B [51] that mediate the effector
function of T cells [58]. However, mechanisms are
not clear as to how therapeutic activation of Notch can
influence the CD8+ T cell function to promote anti-tumor
immune responses. In this study, we observed that CD8+
T cells in tumor-bearing mice following bortezomib
administration not only showed increased Notch1/2
activation but also sustained increased expression of T cell
activation molecules CD25 and CD44, with significantly
improved production of IFNγ and expression of
eomesodermin, perforin and granzyme B. Eomesodermin
is not only important for the differentiation of cytolytic
CD8+ T cells but also helps maintain memory CD8+ T cell
repertoire [59]. We also noted that bortezomib treatment
upregulated the expression of T-bet, another T-box
transcription factor (data not shown), which plays a key
role in cytolytic T cell immunity. Bortezomib, thus, can
not only enhance T cell cytolytic activity but may also
help in the maintenance of the memory T cell pool.
On examining direct effects of bortezomib on the
canonical Notch signaling in CD8+ T cells, we found
that bortezomib increased the cleaved free Notch1
intracellular domain in a dose dependent manner in both
cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, and, as expected,
increased the levels of its downstream targets Hes1
and Hey1, even in presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor,
compound E that blocks the NICD cleavage at the S3 site.
This suggests that bortezomib has an intrinsic ability to
regulate intramembrane Notch proteolysis, or retention
of cleaved NICD, either by (a) augmenting ADAM10mediated membrane proximal cleavage at S2 site, thereby
providing more S2 substrates, which are short-lived and
rate-limiting, for subsequent γ-secretase cleavage at S3,
or (b) allowing Notch cleavage at a site downstream
of γ-secretase activity, and/or (c) enhancing nuclear
localization of NICD. NICD has also been reported to
directly interact with NFκB to affect transcriptional
activity of nuclear NFκB [19].
NFκB is released from the cytoplasm following
the phosphorylation of IκB kinase complex that induces

Tumor-induced immunosuppression is a major
hurdle associated with cancer that renders immunotherapy
inefficient. It is therefore essential that efforts at achieving
effective immunotherapy take into consideration the need
to address immune suppression by tumor. Notch receptors
and ligands are expressed in developing lymphoid tissue
and control both functional differentiation and maturation
of T cells [48-50]. Evidence has accumulated to show
that Notch regulates effector function of T cells [26, 51,
52] though the mechanisms are unclear. Thus, agents that
can selectively enhance Notch signaling in anti-tumor
immune cells are much needed. Results of our study
show that bortezomib can be a promising candidate for
modulating the Notch system to enhance anti-tumor
immune responses. Bortezomib is a dipeptide boronate
proteasome inhibitor that blocks intracellular protein turnover. Studies have shown that bortezomib could sensitize
not only myeloma and lymphoma cells, but also a variety
of human and mouse solid tumor cells to apoptosis [27,
28, 35, 36], thus providing an exciting opportunity for
the development of novel anticancer therapeutics [53].
Bortezomib has also been reported to affect several
cellular pathways including NFκB, histone deacetylases
(HDACs) and death receptor signaling in tumor cells
[54-56]. However, bortezomib’s influence on anti-tumor
immune responses has been controversial. We, therefore,
investigated the effects of BZB on the expression of
effector molecules and Notch-NFκB pathways in T cells
using a tumor therapeutic dose of bortezomib optimized
by us previously [35].
	 We found that lung cancer patients show
impaired Notch signaling in the bone marrow as well
as the secondary tissues of the immune system such as
thymus, spleen and lymph node [26]. Tumor-induced
dysregulation of Notch was confirmed in mice bearing
tumor models such as breast adenocarcinoma 4T1HA,
renal carcinoma RencaHA and lung fibrosarcoma D459,
which showed downregulation of Notch receptors,
Notch1, Notch2, Notch3 and Notch4 as well as Notch
ligands, Dll1, Dll4 and Jagged1 in their lymphoid organs.
Interestingly, administration of bortezomib to tumorbearing mice restored Notch components in these organs
to levels either more or the same as observed in untreated
naïve mice. We observed that bortezomib increased the
expression of Dll1 in lymphoid tissues as well as its
cognate receptors Notch1 and Notch2 on CD8+ T cells.
We also noted that bortezomib increased the expression
of Dll4 and Jagged1 in tested lymphoid tissues, which are
reported to play a role in regulatory T cell differentiation.
However, we observed no significant changes in regulatory
T cell populations following bortezomib treatment (data
not shown). These effects of bortezomib warrant further
investigation. Here, we focused on dissecting the effects
of bortezomib on Notch activation in anti-tumor CD8+ T

MATERIALS AND METHODS

proteasomal degradation of IκBα, enabling subunits of
the active NFκB to translocate to the nucleus to induce
target gene expression and IFNγ production [60]. We
observed that inhibition of NFκB activity in CD8+ T cells
by Bay-11-7082, which blocks IKKα, downregulated their
expression of Notch genes Hes1 and Hey1, underlining an
important crosstalk between Notch and NFκB pathways.
Data show that bortezomib enhances NFκB activity
in CD8+ T cells, in contrast to multiple myeloma cells
where bortezomib was shown to inhibit NFκB activity by
preventing proteosomal degradation of IκBα [61]. One
other study demonstrated differential effects of bortezomib
on NFκB activity depending on different cell types:
bortezomib triggered NFκB activity via canonical pathway
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by non-proteosomal
degradation of IκBα while NFκB activation was inhibited
in bone marrow-derived stromal cells [54]. We observed
a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of
nuclear and cytoplasmic p65 as well as IκBα and IKK
in CD8+ T cells following bortezomib treatment, with no
inhibition by Bay 11, confirming bortezomib-mediated
stimulatory effects on NFκB activation. It is also possible
that bortezomib augmented the activation and nuclear
translocation of other transcription factors such as the
activator protein 1 (AP-1), a heterodimer of c-Fos and
c-Jun, which is activated downstream of the ERK and
JNK pathway. It will be interesting to further investigate
the effects of bortezomib on other CSL (RBP-Jκ in mice)independent Notch signaling pathways, such as Hedgehog,
Jak/STAT, PI3K/Akt, mTOR, and MEK/ERK, which are
also implicated in non-canonical Notch signaling [62-65].
Collectively, results show that bortezomib can
restore Notch signaling in anti-tumor CD8+ T cells by
enhancing a crosstalk between Notch and NFκB pathways
via its multiple effects on the expression of Notch1 and
Notch2 receptors, NICD, and downstream Notch genes,
together with increased phosphorylation of the IκB kinase,
IκBα and p65, which subsequently stimulate NFκB
activity. Consequently, this bortezomib-enhanced NotchNFκB crosstalk improves anti-tumor cytolytic functions
such as IFNγ production and expression of effector
molecules by CD8+ T cells. We are currently exploring
post-transcriptional regulation of these effects by
bortezomib at the level of small non-coding microRNAs
in CD8+ T cells as well as the relevance of bortezomibmediated T cell effects in various immunotherapeutic
settings. Findings of this study predict that bortezomib
can act as a safe and potent immunotherapeutic drug in
sustaining anti-tumor immune effector functions and in
addressing tumor-associated immunosuppression if well
optimized in conjunction with other immune therapies.

Mice
Balb/c mice (6-8 week old) were purchased from
Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). TCRHA-transgenic Cln4
mice were provided by Linda A. Sherman, The Scripps
Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, and were bred at Meharry
Medical College animal facility and genotyped according
to the methods described earlier [45]. Mice were cared
for in accordance with the procedures outlined in the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals. Meharry Medical College
is accredited by the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International and
follows the Public Health Service Policy for the care and
use of laboratory animals under pathogen-free conditions.

Tumor cell lines
The RencaHA line (courtesy Hyam I. Levitsky,
John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), 4T1 (courtesy
Suzanne Ostrand-Rosenberg, University of Maryland,
Baltimore, MD), and D459 were maintained in FCSsupplemented standard RPMI-1640 culture medium. D459
cells are murine fibroblasts malignantly transformed by
transfection of human Ras and mutant human p53 [46].
Low-passage (< 5) tumor cell cultures were used for the
experiments.

Solid tumor induction and tissue harvest
Solid tumors were induced in syngeneic Balb/c WT
or Cln4 mice by injecting 4T1HA, RencaHA or D459
cells subcutaneously at the indicated cell numbers for at
least 10 days. Following the establishment of palpable
subcutaneous tumors of approximately 120 mm3 size,
mice were injected with bortezomib (1 mg/kg body
weight) intravenously and 4 h later lymphoid tissues or
tumor mass were harvested for the preparation of single
cell suspensions.

CD8+ T cell purification and activation
CD8+ T cells were purified from pooled spleen
and lymph node cells by incubating cells with rat antimouse CD8 mAb, followed by positive selection of CD8+
cells with anti-rat IgG Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). For
experiments using GSI in vitro, purified CD8+ T cells were
pretreated with GSI (500 nM; R&D Systems) for 30 min at
37◦C or with DMSO as vehicle control and then stimulated
with soluble anti-mouse CD3 and CD28 antibodies (1 μg/
ml each; Biolegends) for 24 h, followed by treatment with

bortezomib (10 nM) for another 4 h. Similarly, for NFκB
inhibition experiments, CD8+ T cells were pretreated with
5 µM Bay 11-7082 (Sigma) before stimulation with CD3
and CD28 antibodies and treatment with bortezomib.

permeabilization kit (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm™) prior to
staining with intracellular antibodies. Data were acquired
using a Guava EasyCyte HT system (EMD Millipore)
or a FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by
FlowJo software (Treestar Inc.). Following monoclonal
antibodies were used: CD8α-FITC, CD8α-PE, Vβ8.1/2PE, Vβ8.1/2-FITC, CD44-FITC, CD25-PE, IFNγ-PE,
granzyme B-PE, Notch1-APC, and Notch2-PE.

TGFβ suppression
For experiments using TGFβ in vitro, purified
CD8+ T cells from pooled spleen and lymph node cells
from naïve Balb/c mice were stimulated in vitro with
soluble anti-mouse CD3 and CD28 antibodies (1 μg/ml
each; Biolegends) for 24 or 48 h in presence or absence of
treatment with 5 ng/mL recombinant mouse TGFβ (R&D
Systems) at 37oC followed by treatment with bortezomib
(10 nM) for another 4 h. TGFβ was constituted in a buffer
comprising 1N HCL and fetal calf serum. At the end of
the culture, cells were analyzed for IFNγ and granzyme B
secretion by flow cytometry.

Immunoblotting
CD8+ T cells from tumor-bearing or naïve mice were
purified as mentioned earlier and cell pellets were lysed in
complete lysis buffer including protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared
using Ne-per nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent
(Life Technologies). Fifty micrograms of each protein
sample was electrophoresed on NuPage 4-12% BisTris gel (Novex Life Technologies) and transferred to
polyvinylidenedifluoride membranes using an iBlot® Dry
Blotting system (Life Technologies). The membrane was
then blocked in 5% skimmed milk in 1X PBS-Tween-20
(1X PBST) for 2 h at room temperature with gentle
agitation. After blocking, the blots were incubated with
rabbit anti-mouse antibodies against Hes1, Hey1 (1:1000;
abcam, MA), NICD (Val1744), total and phosphorylated
protein of p65 (total D14E12; phospho-S468), IKKα,
phospho-IKKα/β (S176/180) and IκBα (total L35A5;
phospho-S32/36) (Cell Signaling Technologies) in 1%
BSA (in 1X PBST) overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation.
After five washes of 5 minutes each in 1X PBST, blots
were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish
peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of
1:4000 in 1X PBST for 1.5 h, with agitation. The blots
were rinsed again in 1X PBST, and developed by using
chemiluminescence reagent (EMD Millipore, MA) and a
Kodak Image Station. The density of each protein band
was determined by densitometric analysis using the
imageJ software (NIH). The blots were then stripped and
probed with HRP conjugated anti-GAPDH antibody (Cell
Signaling Technologies) to determine equivalent loading.

RNA isolation and quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen) and quantitated by reading the optical density
at 260 nm. Possible genomic DNA contamination was
removed by on-column DNase digestion using the RNasefree DNase set. The cDNA was synthesized using iScript
cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-rad). Real-time quantitative RTPCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using CFX-96 Real Time
System (Bio-rad). The iQ SYBR green supermix (Bio-rad)
and gene-specific PCR primers as listed in Supplementary
Table 1 were used in a 20 μL reaction following protocols
recommended by the manufacturer. The conditions used
for the PCR were as follows: 95°C for 3 min (1 cycle),
94°C for 20 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 40 s (40 cycles).
Fold changes in mRNA expression were assessed by the
∆∆Ct method.

Flow cytometry
Single cell suspensions of RBC-depleted
splenocytes and lymph node cells (2 × 105 cells) were
stained for surface or intracellular immunofluorescence
staining with various antibodies or control isotypes (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, or eBioscience Inc., San Diego,
CA) following FcγR-blocking. For surface staining, cells
were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs in
the dark on ice for 30 min. IFNγ intracellular staining
was measured in T cells following ex vivo re-stimulation
for 5 h with 200 ng/ml ionomycin plus 10 ng/ml phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in the
presence of GolgiStopTM protein transport inhibitor (BD
Biosciences) as per manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,
cells were permeabilized for 20 min with fixation/
