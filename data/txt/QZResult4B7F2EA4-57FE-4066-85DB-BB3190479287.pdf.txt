Abstract
Chemoresistance and radioresistance are considered one of the
primary reasons for therapeutic failure in leukemias and solid
tumors. Targeted radiotherapy using monoclonal antibodies
radiolabeled with A-particles is a promising treatment
approach for high-risk leukemia. We found that targeted
radiotherapy using monoclonal CD45 antibodies radiolabeled
with the A-emitter 213Bi ([213Bi]anti-CD45) induces apoptosis,
activates apoptosis pathways, and breaks B-irradiation–,
;-irradiation–, doxorubicin-, and apoptosis-resistance in
leukemia cells. In contrast to B-irradiation–, ;-irradiation–,
and doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis and DNA damage, [213Bi]
anti-CD45–induced DNA damage was not repaired, and
apoptosis was not inhibited by the nonhomologous endjoining DNA repair mechanism. Depending on the activation
of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, [213Bi]anti-CD45
activated apoptosis pathways in leukemia cells through the
mitochondrial pathway but independent of CD95 receptor/
CD95 ligand interaction. Furthermore, [213Bi]anti-CD45 reversed
deficient activation of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9,
deficient cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and deficient activation of mitochondria in chemoresistant and in
radioresistant and apoptosis-resistant leukemia cells. These
findings show that [213Bi]anti-CD45 is a promising therapeutic
agent to break chemoresistance and radioresistance by
overcoming DNA repair mechanisms in leukemia cells and
provide the foundation for discovery of novel anticancer
compounds. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):1950–8]

Introduction
One of the primary causes for therapeutic failure in radiotherapy
and chemotherapy of leukemia and solid tumors is the resistance
to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs (1). Attempts to improve
the results of chemotherapy and radiotherapy by increasing the
total radiation absorbed dose, by increasing the concentration of
chemotherapeutic drugs, or by changing chemotherapeutic drugs
have only partly been successful (1). Various approaches using
native monoclonal antibodies, immunotoxins and radioimmunoconjugates have emerged as promising treatment strategies.
Selective targeting of tumor cells with radiolabeled antibodies
for systemic radioimmunotherapy was developed, which reduces
toxicity, the limiting factor in treatment of high-risk leukemia and
lymphoma (2–6). Development of effective strategies for radio-

immunotherapy depends on the radionuclide and particularly on
the type of emitted radiation (4). Selective targeting of tumor cells
with radiolabeled antibodies for systemic radioimmunotherapy was
developed using h-emitting nuclides, such 131I, 90Y, 188Re, or 177Lu,
and antibodies, such as anti-CD45, anti-CD66, and anti-CD33 (4).
These seem to provide a well-tolerated, safe, and effective
therapeutic option for patients with high-risk leukemia (4). There
has been an emerging interest in using a-particles, such as 213Bi,
for radioimmunotherapy (7–9). Because of the short path length
(50-80 Am) and high linear energy transfer (f100 keV/Am) of
a-particles emitting radioisotopes, targeted a-particle therapy
offers the potential for higher biological effectiveness and more
specific tumor cell kill with less damage to surrounding normal
tissues compared with h-emitters and external radiation (9). These
properties make targeted a-particle therapy ideal for elimination
of minimal residual or micrometastatic disease (8, 9). Another
potential application is in treating lymphoma and leukemia (9).
However, the mechanism of a-particle–induced cell kill in leukemia
cells is poorly understood at the molecular level.
Anticancer drugs, h-irradiation, and g-irradiation have been
shown to activate apoptosis pathways in leukemias and solid
tumors (10–18). Caspases play a critical role in apoptosis induction
(18, 19). The apoptotic caspases are divided in two classes: effector
caspases, such as caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7, and initiator
caspases, such as caspase-8 and caspase-9 (18). Effector caspases
are responsible for the cleavages that disassemble the cell, and
initiator caspases initiate the proteolytic cascade (19). Two distinct
pathways upstream of the caspase cascade have been identified:
the ligand/receptor–driven amplifier pathway, such as the CD95
receptor/CD95 ligand system, and the direct mitochondrial
activation pathway without ligand/receptor interaction resulting
in cleavage and activation of effector caspases (20). Anticancer
drugs, h-irradiation, and g-irradiation have been shown to activate
the ligand/receptor pathway and the mitochondrial activation
pathway in leukemia and tumor cells (10–14, 18, 20). The
mitochondrial pathway can be activated through the ligand/
receptor system or directly by apoptotic stimuli (19, 20). Caspase-9,
which is released during apoptosis from mitochondria into the
cytosol, triggers caspase-3 activation through the formation of a
cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9–containing apoptosome complex
(19, 21). Bcl-2 family members regulate the mitochondrial pathway
(19, 22). Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-2 or
Bcl-xL, inhibit the cytochrome c release by modulating the ability
of proapoptotic family members, such as Bax and Bak, to open the
voltage dependent ion channels in the outer mitochondrial
membrane (19, 22). The effects of the Bcl-2 family members
depend on the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic
family members (19, 22).
Radiation and anticancer drugs, such as cyclophosphamide,
cisplatin, doxorubicin, or etoposide, induce DNA damage (23–25).

Breaking Chemoresistance and Radioresistance

The nonhomologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ) is the predominant mechanism to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in
mammalian cells, with DNA-PK and ligase IV playing critical roles
(26–28). The first step in DSB repair by NHEJ is the binding of
Ku70/80 to the damaged DNA followed by the recruitment of the
catalytic subunit DNA-PK, thereby forming the active DNA-PK
holoenzyme (23). One of the targets of DNA-PK is XRCC4, which
forms a stable complex with DNA ligase IV (ligase IV), joining the
ends of broken DNA strands (23). In the absence of DNA-PK or
ligase IV, NHEJ fails to repair DSBs (26–31).
In the present study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms
by which anti-CD45 antibodies labeled with 213Bi ([213Bi]anti-CD45)
induced cell death in leukemia cells and the effect of [213Bi]antiCD45 on h-irradiation–, g-irradiation–, apoptosis-, and doxorubicin-resistant leukemia cells. We show that 213Bi bound to CD45
antibodies breaks radioresistance and chemoresistance in leukemia
cells, and we provide the molecular requirements for overcoming
this resistance and for a-particle–induced cell killing. Understanding the molecular mechanisms induced by a-irradiation, such as
213
Bi, in sensitive and resistant leukemia cells may provide
important implications for the further development of novel
treatment options in leukemia therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
The human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60, the human lymphoblastic
leukemia T-cell line CEM, and the human pre-B-lineage leukemia cell line
Nalm6 were grown in RPMI 1640 (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany)
containing 10% FCS (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH
7.3; Biochrom), 100 units/mL penicillin (GIBCO), 100 Ag/mL streptomycin
(GIBCO), and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Biochrom) at 37jC and 5% CO2.
HL-60gammaR cells are resistant to radiation absorbed dose up to 10 Gy
of g-irradiation (14); HL-60betaR cells are resistant to activities up to
876 kBq/mL of h-irradiation (90Y); CEMCD95R cells are resistant to 1 Ag/mL
anti-CD95 (12); and CEMDOXOR cells are resistant to 0.1 Ag/mL doxorubicin
(13). HL-60, HL-60gammaR , HL-60betaR, CEM, CEMDOXOR , and CEMCD95R are
CD45 positive. Nalm6 (DNA ligase IV +/+, +/, /) cells were obtained
from M. Lieber (USC, Los Angeles, CA) and were grown as described above
for Nalm6; 1.5 mg/mL G418 (GIBCO) was added to the medium of the
DNA ligase IV heterozygotic (+/) cells; 1.5 mg/mL G418 and 4 Ag/mL
puromycin (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany) were used for the cultivation of
the DNA ligase IV–deficient (/) cells.
All cell lines used in this study were suspension cell lines.
Cells (2  105/mL) were a-irradiated with 213Bi or [213Bi]anti-CD45,
h-irradiated with [90Y]anti-CD45, and g-irradiated in 150 mL flasks
(100 mL). Twenty-four hours after treatment with different activities of
213
Bi, [213Bi]anti-CD45, and [90Y]anti-CD45, cells were washed twice with
RPMI 1640. After washing, cells were resuspended in medium and incubated
at 37jC for 24, 48, or 72 h.

Dosimetry, Radiation Exposure, and Radionuclides
For a-particles, 213Bi was used with a half-life of 45.6 min and decays
by a branched pathway by a- and h-emissions to stable 209Bi (32). Of the
emitted energy, 80% is deposited by a-particles with energies of 8.4 MeV
(79%) and 5.9 MeV (1%; ref. 32). Activities were applied in 100 mL within
24 h using 0.75, 2.25, 7.5, 15, 22.5, and 74.6 MBq of 213Bi, respectively,
and correspond to radiation absorbed doses of 0.05, 0.15, 0.5, 1, 1.5,
and 5 Gy.
For h-particles, 90Y was used with a half-life of 64 h and decays by
h-emission (100%, 2.3 MeV) to stable 90Zr (33). Activities were applied in
100 mL within 24 h using 8.8, 26.3, and 87.6 MBq of 90Y, respectively, and
correspond to radiation absorbed doses of 1, 3, and 10 Gy.
g-Irradiation of cells were done with a Philips MG320, operated at 300 kV
with a 0.6-mm copper filter (1.9 mm copper half value layer). The dose rate

was f0.4 Gy/min; the inhomogeneity within the field was lower than F1%.
The applied doses were measured with a transmission chamber (PTW,
Freiburg, Germany), which was referenced against a Farmer 2570 device
equipped with a 0.6-cc sensor (Nuclear Enterprises, Edinburgh, United
Kingdom).

Monoclonal CD45 Antibody (anti-CD45)
The rat IgG2a monoclonal antibody YAML568 recognizes the CD45
antigen present on human leukocytes and was provided by Dr. G. Hale (Sir
William Dunn School of Pathology, Oxford, United Kingdom; refs. 34, 35).

Conjugation of Chelate to Anti-CD45 and Radiolabeling with
213
Bi or 90Y
Anti–CD45-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (antibody conjugate).
Anti-CD45 in HEPES-buffer (50 mmol/L, pH 9.5) was conjugated with
p-SCN-CHX-A00-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and p-SCN-MXDTPA (Macrocyclics, Dallas, TX), respectively, using an initial molar ratio of
1:5 for 20 h at 25jC. After the reaction, excessive chelator was removed via
PD10 desalting column chromatography. The average number of chelates
per antibody was determined by the yttrium-arsenazo(III) spectrophotometric method and found to be 3 to 4 (36).
[213Bi]anti-CD45. 213Bi was produced from a 225Ac/213Bi generator
system (Institute for Transuranium Elements, Karlsruhe, Germany; ref. 37)
and was incubated with antibody conjugate for 5 min. The radiolabeled
antibody was purified by PD10 desalting column chromatography.
[90Y]anti-CD45. [90Y]YCl3 in 0.05 mol/L HCl (AEA, Braunschweig,
Germany) was diluted with 0.05 mol/L sodium citrate/sodium acetate
buffer (pH 5.5) followed incubation with antibody conjugate for 5 min. The
antibody was diluted with 7.5% HSA-PBS buffered solution.

CD45 Binding
Cells were stained with 2 Ag of anti-CD45, anti-CD45-DTPA (conjugated
antibody), and [213Bi]anti-CD45 followed by a secondary antibody goatF(ab¶)2 anti-rat IgG-phycoerythrin (1:20, Southern Biotechnology Associates,
Inc., Birmingham, AL). Immunofluorescence analysis was done on a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD, Heidelberg, Germany). Rat IgG2a isotype
control antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates) was used for
detecting unspecific binding of anti-CD45.

Induction of Apoptosis and Cell Cycle
Quantification of apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were done by flow
cytometry as described (14, 38, 39). To determine apoptosis, cells were
lysed with Nicoletti buffer containing 0.1% sodium citrate plus 0.1% Triton
X-100 and 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide at 4jC (38). The percentage of
apoptotic cells was measured by hypodiploid DNA (subG1) by the Nicoletti
method (38) or forward scatter/side scatter analysis (39). Propidium iodide–
stained nuclei (38) or forward scatter/side scatter profile of cells (39) were
analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg,
Germany).

Western Blot Analysis
Western blot analyses were done as described (13, 14). Immunodetection
of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase-3, active caspase-9, XIAP,
CD95, CD95-L, Bax, Bcl-xL, and h-actin was done using rabbit anti-PARP
polyclonal antibody (1:5,000; Enzyme Systems Products, Dublin, CA), mouse
anti-caspase-3 monoclonal antibody (1:500; Cell Signaling Technologies,
Beverly, MA), mouse anti-caspase-8 monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; Cell
Signaling), rabbit anti–active caspase-9 polyclonal antibody (1:200; Chemicon
International, Temecula, CA), mouse anti-XIAP monoclonal antibody
(1:1,000; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), mouse anti-Fas (antiCD95) monoclonal antibody (1:1,000; Transduction Laboratories), mouse
anti–Fas ligand (anti–CD95 ligand) monoclonal antibody (1:250; BD), rabbit
anti-Bax polyclonal antibody (1:250; Oncogene, Cambridge, MA), rabbit antiBcl-XS/L polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA), rabbit anti-p21 polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-h-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
IgG (1:5,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as secondary antibody was used for

the enhanced chemoluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia, Freiburg,
Germany). Equal protein loading was controlled by h-actin detection.

Measurement of DNA Damage
DNA damage (DNA breaks) was measured by the alkaline Comet assay as
described (40). Ten microliters of cell suspension (10,000 cells) from treated
and untreated cells were resuspended in 120 AL low-melting agarose at
37jC. One hundred microliters of this suspension were spotted onto a
microscope slide and covered with a coverslide. After keeping on ice for
5 min in the dark, the coverslide was removed, and the slides were
incubated overnight in lysis buffer containing 2.5 mol/L NaCl, 100 mmol/L
EDTA, 10 mmol/L Tris, and 1% Na-laurylsarcosinate (pH 10). Thereafter,
slides were preincubated in electrophoresis buffer [300 mmol/L NaOH,
1 mmol/L EDTA (pH > 13)] for 25 min, and electrophoresis was done for
25 min (25 V, 300 mA). Slides were neutralized in 0.4 mol/L Tris (pH 7.5),
washed in aqua dest, fixed in 100% ethanol for 5 min, and air-dried overnight. Analysis was done after staining with ethidium bromide (20 Ag/mL)
on a fluorescence microscope using a CCD camera connected to a personal
computer and analysis software. Relative DNA breakage was expressed as
Olive tail moment, which was determined by measuring the fluorescence
intensity of tail and nucleus using Kinetic Imaging Komet 5.0 Software (BFIOptilas, Puchheim, Germany).

followed by secondary antibody antirat IgG-phycoerythrin (antirat IgG-PE ) and

HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells were treated with different activities of [213Bi]anti-CD45
as indicated. The different activities of [213Bi]anti-CD45 were applied over
24 h. After 24 h (black columns ), 48 h (white columns ), and 72 h (hatched
columns ), the percentages of apoptotic cells were measured by hypodiploid DNA
analysis. The percentage of specific cell death was calculated as follows:

bars, SD <10%. Similar results were obtained in three independent
experiments. C, [213Bi]anti-CD45 and 213Bi induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. HL-60

213
Bi (white columns ), or 4 Ag/mL anti-CD45 with addition of 75 kBq/mL 213Bi
(213Bi + anti-CD45, hatched columns ). The activities of [213Bi]anti-CD45 or 213Bi
were applied over 24 h. After 24 and 48 h, the percentage of apoptotic cells was
measured by hypodiploid DNA analysis. The percentage of specific cell death

[213Bi]anti-CD45 and 213Bi induce apoptosis in leukemia
cells. Anticancer drugs, h-irradiation, and g-irradiation have been
shown to activate apoptosis pathways in leukemias and solid
tumors (10–18). To analyze which type of cell death (apoptosis or
necrosis) can be induced by targeted a-irradiation in HL-60
leukemia cells, we used 213Bi for a-irradiation, and as antibody, we
chose anti-CD45. At first, we proved the binding of [213Bi]anti-CD45
to the surface of HL-60 cells with flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1A).
We found that anti-CD45, anti-CD45-DTPA, and [213Bi]anti-CD45
bound strongly with identical intensities to HL-60 cells, which
express CD45 on the surface. This indicates that HL-60 cells are
target cells for CD45 antibodies. Next, we investigated apoptosis
induction by [213Bi]anti-CD45 in HL-60 cells (Fig. 1B). For activities
of 75, 225, and 746 kBq/mL [213Bi]anti-CD45, a strong induction
of apoptosis was detected in HL-60 cells after 24, 48, and 72 h
(Fig. 1B). In addition, [213Bi]anti-CD45, when bound to CD45 of
HL-60 cells, induced higher apoptosis rates in HL-60 cells after
24 and 48 h when compared with 213Bi, which was diluted in
medium and not bound to CD45 antibody, or compared with 213Bi
diluted in medium in combination with nonradioactive anti-CD45
(Fig. 1C), indicating that targeted a-particle radioimmunotherapy
with [213Bi]anti-CD45 kills preferred single-targeted leukemia cells.
[213Bi]anti-CD45 and [90Y]anti-CD45 induce apoptosis with
different efficiencies at comparable activities in leukemia
cells. We recently found that h-irradiation used in radioimmunotherapy and external g-irradiation induce apoptosis in leukemia
cells with different apoptosis rates and efficiencies (14). We
therefore compared apoptosis induction of an a-emitter (213Bi)
bound to the CD45 antibody ([213Bi]anti-CD45) and a h-emitter
(90Y) bound to the CD45 antibody ([90Y]anti-CD45), which is used
during radioimmunotherapy of high-risk leukemia in vivo, for
different activities. At comparable activities and time points,
[90Y]anti-CD45 and [213Bi]anti-CD45 also exhibited differences in
apoptosis rates (Fig. 2A and B). [213Bi]anti-CD45 induced a higher
apoptosis rate in contrast to [90Y]anti-CD45. At activities < 37.5
kBq/mL, [213Bi]anti-CD45 killed HL-60 leukemia cells up to 60%
and CEM leukemia cells up to 95%. In contrast, HL-60 and CEM
leukemia cells survived after treatment with comparable activities

applied by [90Y]anti-CD45, suggesting that [213Bi]anti-CD45 is much
more potent in killing leukemia cells than [90Y]anti-CD45 using
during radioimmunotherapy in vivo.
[213 Bi]anti-CD45 breaks doxorubicin-resistance, CD95resistance, and radioresistance to B-irradiation and ;-irradiation in leukemia cells. Resistance to cytotoxic drugs and external
radiation is a major problem and a limiting factor in treatment of
tumor patients (14, 41). Cross-resistance has been noted between
radiotherapy and chemotherapy and involves defects in apoptosis
signaling or an increased ability to repair DNA (14, 41). We have
found that an a-emitter bound to anti-CD45 is much more effective
in cell killing than that of a h-emitter bound to anti-CD45 or
g-emitter. Therefore, we investigated if [213Bi]anti-CD45 can induce
cell killing in radioresistant and in chemoresistant and apoptosisresistant leukemia cells. We treated doxorubicin-, CD95-, girradiation–, and h-irradiation–resistant leukemia cells with
different activities of [213Bi]anti-CD45 (Fig. 3). After different time
intervals, cell killing was measured by flow cytometry. After
treatment activities of 75, 225, and 746 kBq/mL using [213Bi]antiCD45, we detected that a-particle irradiation with [213Bi]anti-CD45
induced apoptosis in h-irradiation–resistant HL-60 (HL-60betaR;
Fig. 3A) and in g-irradiation–resistant HL-60 (HL-60gammaR) cells
up to 80% (Fig. 3B) after 48 h. In addition, we treated doxorubicinresistant (CEMDoxoR), CD95-resistant (CEMCD95R), and parental
sensitive CEM cells with different activities (7.5, 22.5, 75, 150, and
225 kBq/mL) of [213Bi]anti-CD45 (Fig. 3C). After 24, 48, and 72 h,
a strong induction of apoptosis up to 95% was determined in
doxorubicin-resistant CEM cells (CEMDoxoR; Fig. 3C) similar to that
in sensitive CEM cells (CEM; Fig. 3C). Sixty-five percent of apoptosis was detected for equal radiation absorbed doses and at
the same time points in CD95-resistant CEM cells (CEMCD95R;
Fig. 3C). These findings provide evidence that [213Bi]anti-CD45 is
able to induce apoptosis in h-irradiation–, g-irradiation–, doxorubicin-, and CD95-resistant leukemia cells, indicating that [213Bi]anti-CD45 breaks radioresistance, chemoresistance, and apoptosis
resistance in these cells.
[213Bi]anti-CD45 activates caspases and PARP cleavage in
HL-60 cells through the mitochondrial pathway independent
of CD95 ligand/receptor system. h-Irradiation and g-irradiation
activates apoptosis pathways and caspases involving ligand
receptor–driven pathways and the mitochondrial pathway (14).
Defects in apoptosis signaling are due to resistance to radiation
and chemotherapy (14, 41). To identify effector molecules that may
be altered by [213Bi]anti-CD45 in sensitive and resistant leukemia
cells, we examined differences of caspase activation by Western
blot analysis. After incubation with activities of 75, 225, and 746
kBq/mL using [213Bi]anti-CD45, a strong activation of caspase-3
(Fig. 4A), activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 4B), and PARP cleavage
(Fig. 4A) were observed in HL-60 cells after 24 and 48 h. In addition,
[213Bi]anti-CD45 reversed defective activation of caspases and
PARP cleavage in radioresistant and chemoresistant leukemia cells
completely. This suggests that after irradiation with [213Bi]antiCD45, caspases were activated, and PARP, the prototype caspase
substrate, was processed in sensitive and in resistant leukemia
cells. In contrast to [213Bi]anti-CD45, activation of caspase-3 and
caspase-8 and PARP cleavage were strongly reduced when 213Bi was
diluted in medium and not bound to CD45 antibody (Fig. 4A and
B), showing that 213Bi activates caspases preferred in target cells.
Caspase activation is central in apoptosis induction (13, 14). To
examine the role of caspase activation in a-particle irradiation–
induced apoptosis, we incubated HL-60 cells with [213Bi]anti-CD45

inhibition of caspase activation, showing that caspases are central

of the cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9–containing apoptosome

The apoptosome complex itself activates caspase-3 (19). To assess
the role of mitochondria in [213Bi]anti-CD45–induced apoptosis, we
examined caspase-9 activation and XIAP expression, an inhibitor of
caspase activation, after [213Bi]anti-CD45 treatment. After incubation with different activities (75, 225, and 746 kBq/mL) using
[213Bi]anti-CD45, a strong activation of caspase-9 and downregulation of XIAP were seen in HL-60 cells (Fig. 4D). This indicates
that mitochondria play a role in [213Bi]anti-CD45–induced
apoptosis in leukemia cells. In addition, defective activation of
caspase-9 was reversed completely after [213Bi]anti-CD45 treatment

in radioresistant and chemoresistant leukemia cells (data not
shown), showing that [213Bi]anti-CD45 reversed deficient activation
of mitochondria in chemoresistant and radioresistant leukemia
cells. Proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family
play an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial changes
(22). After application of [213Bi]anti-CD45 (75, 225, and 746 kBq/mL),
a reduction of Bcl-xL and an induction of Bax (Fig. 4D) were
found, suggesting that proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members
are involved in [213Bi]anti-CD45–induced cell death in leukemia
cells. In contrast to [213Bi]anti-CD45, activation of caspases-9, XIAP

[213Bi]anti-CD45 as indicated. The different activities were applied over 24 h. After 24 h (black columns ) and 48 h (white columns ), the percentage of apoptotic
cells was measured by the hypodiploid DNA analysis. The percentage of specific cell death was calculated as described in Fig. 1B . Columns, mean of triplicates; bars,

(HL-60gammaR). HL-60gammaR (resistant up to 10 Gy of g-irradiation) cells were treated with different activities of [213Bi]anti-CD45 as indicated. The different activities
were applied over 24 h. After 24 h (black columns ) and 48 h (white columns ), the percentage of apoptotic cells was measured by the hypodiploid DNA analysis. The

4 Ag/mL anti-CD45-DTPA (CD45). The different activities were applied over 24 h. After 24 h (black columns ), 48 h (white columns), and 72 h (hatched columns ),
the percentage of apoptotic cells was measured by the hypodiploid DNA analysis. The percentage of specific cell death was calculated as described in Fig. 1B.

Figure 4. A, [213Bi]anti-CD45 induced activation of caspase-3 (Casp-3 ) and PARP cleavage in HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells were treated with different activities of
[213Bi]anti-CD45 or 213Bi as indicated, with 2 Ag/mL anti-CD45-DTPA or left untreated (CONTROL ). The different activities were applied over 24 h. After 24 and 48 h,
Western blot analyses for caspase-3 and PARP were done. The active fragment of caspase-3 was detected at f17 kDa, and the cleaved product of PARP was
detected at f85 kDa. Equal protein loading was controlled by anti-h-actin antibody. B, [213Bi]anti-CD45 induced activation of caspase-8 (Casp-8 ) in HL-60 cells.
HL-60 cells were treated with different activities of [213Bi]anti-CD45 or 213Bi as indicated, with 2 Ag/mL anti-CD45-DTPA or left untreated (CONTROL ). The different
activities were applied over 24 h. After 24 and 48 h, Western blot analyses for caspase-8 was done. The active fragment of caspase-8 was detected at f18 kDa.
Equal protein loading was controlled with anti-h-actin antibody. C, inhibition of [213Bi]anti-CD45 induced apoptosis by z-VAD.fmk in HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells were treated
with different activities of [213Bi]anti-CD45 as indicated in the absence (black columns, Medium ) or presence (white columns , 50 lM z-VAD.fmk ) of 50 Amol/L

(CONTROL ). The different activities were applied over 24 h. After 24 and 48 h, Western blot analyses for active caspase-9, XIAP, Bcl-xL, and Bax were done. The active
fragment of caspase-9 was detected at f37 kDa; XIAP was detected at f58 kDa; Bcl-xL was detected at f30 kDa; and Bax was detected at f23 kDa. Equal protein
loading was controlled by anti-h-actin antibody.

down-regulation, Bax up-regulation, and Bcl-xL down-regulation
were reduced when 213Bi was diluted in medium and not bound to
CD45 antibody (Fig. 4D), showing that 213Bi activates mitochondria
preferred in target cells.
We found that the CD95 receptor/CD95 ligand system is involved
in h-irradiation– and in g-irradiation–induced apoptosis that
mediated cell death via activation of caspases in leukemia cells
(14). Therefore, we assessed the involvement of the CD95 receptor/
CD95 ligand system in a-irradiation–induced apoptosis in HL-60
cells as well. Treatment of HL-60 cells with [213Bi]anti-CD45
(75 and 225 kBq/mL) induced up-regulation of the CD95 receptor
(Fig. 5). However, upon treatment with [213Bi]anti-CD45 (75 and
225 kBq/mL), induction of the CD95 ligand did not seem to
account for the activation of caspases (Fig. 5), suggesting that

the CD95 receptor/CD95 ligand system is not involved in
a-irradiation–induced apoptosis.
[213Bi]anti-CD45 induces DNA damage and overcomes DNA
repair. DNA repair mechanisms play a critical role in radioresistance and in chemoresistance (23, 41). Increased DNA repair
was shown in tumor cells resistant to radiation and anticancer
drugs in comparison with sensitive tumor cells (42). Inhibition of
DNA repair with DNA repair enzymes inhibitors overcomes
radioresistance, chemoresistance, and apoptosis resistance in
leukemia cells (14). [213Bi]anti-CD45 induces DNA damage in
leukemia cells (Fig. 6A and B). After the application of [213Bi]antiCD45 (225 kBq/mL), a strong induction of DNA damage was found
in HL-60 cells as measured by the Comet assay (Fig. 6A) and
quantified by the fluorescence intensity of tail and nucleus

(Fig. 6B). NHEJ is the predominant mechanism in DSBs repair in
mammalian cells, with DNA-PK and ligase IV playing critical roles
(26–28). In the absence of DNA-PK or ligase IV, NHEJ fails to repair
DSBs (26–31). h-Irradiation– and g-irradiation–induced DNA
damage is repaired by the NHEJ DNA repair pathway (Fig. 6C).
After treatment with h-irradiation (90Y; Fig. 6C) or g-irradiation
(Fig. 6C), a strong reduction of apoptosis was found in DNA repair–
proficient ligase IV+/+ Nalm6 and ligase IV+/ Nalm6 cells, and
strong induction of apoptosis was seen in NHEJ DNA repair–
deficient ligase IV/ Nalm6 cells. We investigated whether
a-irradiation–induced apoptosis and DNA damage are suppressed
by NHEJ DNA repair. We treated ligase IV+/+, ligase IV+/, and
ligase IV/ Nalm6 cells with 213Bi (Fig. 6C). In contrast to
h-irradiation (Fig. 6C), g-irradiation (Fig. 6C), and doxorubicin
(data not shown), we could not detected differences in apoptosis
induction and DNA damage after treatment with 213Bi in DNA
repair–proficient ligase IV+/+ Nalm6, ligase IV+/ Nalm6, and DNA
repair–deficient ligase IV/ Nalm6 cells (Fig. 6C), indicating that
[213Bi]anti-CD45–induced apoptosis was not inhibited by the DNA
repair mechanism NHEJ.

Discussion
Resistance to chemotherapy or radiation therapy is one of the
primary causes for treatment failure of malignomas (1, 41). Therefore, new options are needed to improve therapeutic success in
the treatment of cancer. Various approaches using native monoclonal, immunotoxins, and radioimmunoconjugates have emerged
as promising strategies. Clinical studies of radioimmunotherapy
have used h-emitters, such as 90Y and 131I bound to anti-CD45,
anti-CD33, or anti-CD66 antibodies (2, 4–6). When labeled with the
h-emitters 90Y or 131I, the antibodies destroys cells via cross-fire
effects, leading to the destruction of surrounding tumor cells, but
h-irradiated target cells may survive without the cross-fire effect
from neighboring cells. This effect can also result in the killing
of normal bystander cells and produce significant toxicity (7).
In contrast, a-particles, such as 213Bi and 225Ac, with their short
path lengths destroy mainly target cells with limited side effects
(8, 9). Therefore, radioimmunotherapy with a-particle–emitting

[213Bi]anti-CD45–treated HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells were treated with different
activities of [213Bi]anti-CD45 or 213Bi as indicated or left untreated (CONTROL).
The different activities were applied over 24 h. After 48 h, Western blot
analysis for CD95 receptor and CD95 ligand was done. The CD95 receptor was
detected at f38 kDa, and the CD95 ligand was detected at f40 kDa. Equal
protein loading was controlled by anti-h-actin antibody.

isotope–labeled antibodies may produce more efficient cell killing
of individual target cells with little damage to surrounding normal
tissue (7). In addition, targeted a-particles may be well suited for the
treatment of micrometastatic and minimal residual disease and for
treatment of leukemia and lymphoma (7–9). In our study, we show
that 213Bi bound to CD45 antibodies break radioresistance and
chemoresistance in leukemia cells, and we provide the molecular
requirements for overcoming this resistance and for a-particle–
induced cell killing. Our findings are crucial and fundamental for
the development of novel treatment options in leukemia therapy.
We have recently published that g-irradiation and h-irradiation
differed in apoptosis induction, indicating that different types of
radiation may play a different role in apoptosis induction (14).
At comparable activities and time points, the h-emitter 90Y
bound to anti-CD45 ([90Y]anti-CD45) and the a-emitter 213Bi bound
to anti-CD45 ([213Bi]anti-CD45) also exhibited differences in apoptosis rates. [213Bi]anti-CD45 induced a higher apoptosis rate in
contrast to [90Y]anti-CD45 at comparable activities. At activities
<37.5 kBq/mL, [213Bi]anti-CD45 killed HL-60 leukemia cells up to
60% and CEM leukemia cells up to 95%. In contrast, HL-60 and
CEM leukemia cells survived after treatment with comparable
activities applied by [90Y]anti-CD45, suggesting that targeted airradiation using [213Bi]anti-CD45 is much more potent in killing
leukemia cells than targeted h-irradiation with [90Y]anti-CD45,
which is used during radioimmunotherapy of high-risk leukemia
in vivo.
Resistance to cytotoxic drugs and radiation is a major problem
and a limiting factor in treatment of tumor patients (14, 41). Crossresistance has been noted between radiotherapy and chemotherapy
and involves defects in apoptosis signaling or an increased ability to
repair DNA (14, 41). We provide evidence that [213Bi]anti-CD45 is
able to induce apoptosis in h-irradiation–, g-irradiation–, doxorubicin-, and CD95-resistant leukemia cells, indicating that [213Bi]
anti-CD45 breaks radioresistance, chemoresistance, and apoptosis
resistance in leukemia cells. Our findings suggest that targeted
a-particle therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of
leukemias resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation.
h-Irradiation and g-irradiation activates apoptosis pathways
and caspases involving ligand receptor–driven pathways and the
mitochondrial pathway (14). Interestingly, a-irradiation induced
apoptosis in leukemia cells involving the mitochondrial pathway
independent of the CD95 receptor/ligand interaction. After
irradiation with [213Bi]anti-CD45, caspase-3 and caspase-8 were
activated, and PARP, the prototype caspase substrate, was
processed in leukemia cells. In addition, deficient activation of
caspases was reversed after irradiation with [213Bi]anti-CD45 in
chemoresistant and radioresistant leukemia cells. Formation of the
cytochrome c/Apaf-1/caspase-9–containing apoptosome complex
plays a critical role in mitochondrial activation (19, 21). The
apoptosome complex itself activates caspase-3 (19). [213Bi]antiCD45 induced caspase-9 activation and XIAP (19, 43) downregulation, indicating that mitochondria are involved in [213Bi]antiCD45–triggered apoptosis in leukemia cells. In addition, deficient
activation of mitochondria was reversed in chemoresistant and
radioresistant leukemia cells after [213Bi]anti-CD45 treatment. The
effect of apoptosis induction and caspase activation was strongly
reduced when 213Bi was not bound to CD45, suggesting that 213Bi
induces cell kill and activates apoptosis pathways specifically in
target cells.
h-Irradiation and g-irradiation induced apoptosis involved
induction of CD95 ligand expression that mediated cell death via

(CONTROL ). After 0.5, 1, and 2 h, alkaline electrophoresis (Comet assay) was done. DNA damage was measured (A) by Comet assay and (B) was quantified by the
fluorescence intensity of the tail and nucleus (Olive tail moment, OTM ). C, a-irradiation–induced apoptosis in leukemia cells is not inhibited by NHEJ DNA repair

activation of caspases (14). Upon treatment with [213Bi]anti-CD45,
induction of the CD95 ligand did not seem to account for the
activation of caspases. However, up-regulation of the CD95
receptor was found after treatment with [213Bi]anti-CD45 in
HL-60 cells. Posovsky et al. showed that cytotoxic drugs sensitized
acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells to apoptotic signaling by
up-regulation of the CD95 receptor (44). We hypothesize that
up-regulation of CD95 receptor by [213Bi]anti-CD45 may sensitize
leukemia cells towards apoptotic signaling, such as CD95, and
cytotoxic drugs, such as doxorubicin, which up-regulate CD95
ligand in leukemia cells (12). Bcl-2 family members regulate the
mitochondrial pathway (22). After treatment with [213Bi]anti-CD45,
we detected a strong up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of
Bcl-xL, suggesting that proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members

www.aacrjournals.org

are involved in [213Bi]anti-CD45–induced cell death in leukemia
cells.
Increased DNA repair was shown in tumor cells resistant to
radiation and anticancer drugs in comparison with sensitive tumor
cells (42). In addition, inhibition of DNA repair with DNA repair
enzymes inhibitors overcomes radioresistance, chemoresistance,
and apoptosis resistance in leukemia cells (14). NHEJ is the
predominant mechanism in DSBs repair in mammalian cells (42).
We have found that NHEJ inhibits doxorubicin-, g-irradiation–,
and h-irradiation–induced apoptosis. [213Bi]anti-CD45–induced
apoptosis was not inhibited by NHEJ, suggesting that a-irradiation
overrides DNA repair in leukemia cells. Thus, our findings provide
evidence that [213Bi]anti-CD45 breaks chemoresistance and radioresistance by overcoming DNA repair mechanisms.

In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of using
[213Bi]anti-CD45 in leukemia therapy to improve therapeutic
success. [213Bi]anti-CD45 is a promising radiotherapeutic agent
to break chemoresistance and radioresistance in leukemias by
overcoming the cellular DNA repair. These findings are crucial and
fundamental for the development of novel treatment options in
leukemia and solid tumor therapy and provide the foundation for
discovery of novel anticancer compounds.
