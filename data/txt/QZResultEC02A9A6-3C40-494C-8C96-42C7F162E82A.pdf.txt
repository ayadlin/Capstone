Abstract
The histone methyltransferase EZH2 is a central epigenetic regulator of cell survival, proliferation, and cancer
stem cell (CSC) function. EZH2 expression is increased in various human cancers, including highly aggressive
pancreatic cancers, but the mechanisms underlying for its biologic effects are not yet well understood. In this
study, we probed EZH2 function in pancreatic cancer using diﬂourinated-curcumin (CDF), a novel analogue of
the turmeric spice component curcumin that has antioxidant properties. CDF decreased pancreatic cancer cell
survival, clonogenicity, formation of pancreatospheres, invasive cell migration, and CSC function in human
pancreatic cancer cells. These effects were associated with decreased expression of EZH2 and increased
expression of a panel of tumor-suppressive microRNAs (miRNA), including let-7a,b,c,d, miR-26a, miR-101,
miR-146a, and miR-200b,c that are typically lost in pancreatic cancer. Mechanistic investigations revealed that
reexpression of miR-101 was sufﬁcient to limit the expression of EZH2 and the proinvasive cell surface adhesion
molecule EpCAM. In an orthotopic xenograft model of human pancreatic cancer, administration of CDF inhibited
tumor growth in a manner associated with reduced expression of EZH2, Notch-1, CD44, EpCAM, and Nanog and
increased expression of let-7, miR-26a, and miR-101. Taken together, our results indicated that CDF inhibited
pancreatic cancer tumor growth and aggressiveness by targeting an EZH2-miRNA regulatory circuit for
epigenetically controlled gene expression. Cancer Res; 72(1); 335–45. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the
most lethal malignancies with worst prognosis. Annually,
37,000 patients are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and
accounting for 34,000 deaths, which is the fourth leading cause
of cancer-related deaths in the United States (1). Over the past 2
decades, numerous efforts have been made in the treatment
strategies including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, gene
therapy, and immunotherapy to improve the survival of
patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer; however, the outcome has been very disappointing. Because of the absence of
speciﬁc early symptoms and the lack of early detection

methods, pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced
incurable stage (2, 3). Thus, the median overall survival is only 5
to 6 months after conventional therapies, resulting in less than 5
% overall 5-year survival rate (3). This disappointing survival
outcome is, in part, due to late diagnosis as well as intrinsic
(de novo) and extrinsic (acquired) therapeutic resistance of
pancreatic cancer to conventional therapeutics.
A large number of studies have shown that the resistance to
chemoradiation therapy and other currently available targeted
therapies are, in part, due to the survival of tumor-initiating
cells or cancer stem cells (CSC), a minor population of cells in
the tumor mass (3–6), and their further enrichment after
therapy. CSCs posses the ability of self-renewal and have the
potential to regenerate into all types of differentiated cells
within the tumor cell populations, which contribute to drive
continued expansion of the population of malignant cells,
which leads to increased invasion and metastasis (3–6). Thus,
the failure to eliminate these special cells is considered to be
one of the underlying causes of treatment failure, which is, in
part, due to tumor cell resistance to conventional therapeutics,
resulting in tumor recurrence and metastasis, suggesting that
the identiﬁcation of novel targets and targeted therapies are
urgently needed for overcoming therapeutic resistance, which
indeed could be achieved by targeted killing of CSCs.
To that end, enhancer of Zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) received
increased attention in recent years. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase enhancer of polycomb group complexes and it is a

critical part of the cellular machinery involved in the epigenetic
regulation of gene transcription (7). Polycomb group proteins
are a class of chromatin-modifying enzymes that are capable of
methylation of both DNA and core histones to regulate gene
expression. Emerging evidence suggest that polycomb group
proteins play important role in stem cell maintenance,
X-inactivation, imprinting, development, differentiation, and
proliferation. The altered expressions of many polycomb group
proteins have been found to be associated with the development of cancers (8). Overexpression of EZH2 has been found in
a variety of tumors such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, and
PDAC (9–12) and found to be directly responsible for the de
novo suppression in the expression of multiple genes involved
in human cancers (13–15); however, the exact molecular
mechanism(s) by which EZH2 plays a role in tumorigenesis
is not clear. Emerging evidence suggest that the overexpression
of EZH2 might cause normal cells to dedifferentiate back to the
stem cell–like state by epigenetically repressing cell fate–
regulating genes and tumor suppressor genes, leading to the
development of tumor (8, 14, 16), suggesting that further
mechanistic understanding of EZH2 regulation and ﬁnding
novel agents that could inactivate EZH2 would become a novel
strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
In this study, we examined the effect of diﬂourinated-curcumin (CDF), a novel synthetic derivative of curcumin and a
known natural antitumor agent, on cell survival, clonogenicity,
sphere-forming capacity, cell migration and invasion, CSC
self-renewal capacity, and the expression regulation of EZH2
by miRNAs in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. We also examined
the role of EZH2 in the regulation of cell growth, clonogenicity,
cell migration and invasion, and miRNA expression in pancreatic cancer cells and mechanistically investigated the regulation of EZH2 expression by siRNA transfection approach.
Most importantly, we examined the role of miR-101 in the
expression of EZH2, EpCAM, Notch-1, and Oct4 in pancreatic
cancer cells in vitro and also in an orthotopic animal model of
pancreatic cancer in vivo and their mechanistic correlation
with antitumor activity of CDF.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1 and MiaPaCa-2
were used for this study on the basis of their sensitivities to
chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine, as described previously
(17, 18). Both cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen), supplemented with 5%
FBS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL
streptomycin in a standard culture condition, as described
previously (17, 18). The cell lines have been tested and authenticated in the core facility "Applied Genomics Technology
Center" at Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, on March 13,
2009. The method used for testing was short tandem repeat
(STR) proﬁling using the PowerPlex 16 System from Promega.
Reagents and antibodies
CDF, a synthetic derivative of curcumin, was synthesized as
described in our earlier publications (17, 19). Antibodies

336

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

against CD44, EpCAM, cleaved Notch-1, and SHH were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against
Notch-1, ABCG2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, and
Hes-1 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Antibodies against
b-actin and EZH2 were acquired from Sigma Chemicals and
BD Transduction.
Cell growth and survival assay
MTT assay was conducted to assess cell survival and growth.
Both cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of CDF
(0.1–1 mmol/L) for 3 days of treatment, and after 3 days, MTT
assay was conducted as described previously (17).
Clonogenic assay
Clonogenic assay was conducted to examine the effect of
CDF (0.5 mmol/L) on cell growth and proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells as described previously (17, 20). Brieﬂy, 5  104
cells were plated in a 6-well plate and after 72 hours of exposure
to 0.5 mmol/L of CDF, 1,000 single viable cells were plated in
100-mm Petri dishes. The cells were then incubated for 10 to 12
days at 37 C in a 5% CO2/5% O2/90% N2 incubator. Colonies
were stained with 2% crystal violet, washed with water, and
counted.
Cell migration (wound-healing) assay
Cell migration (wound-healing) assay was conducted to
assess the capacity of cell migration and invasion as described
previously (21). Brieﬂy, when the cells reached 90% to 95%
conﬂuency, the wound was generated by scratching the surface
of the plates with a pipette tip. The cells were then incubated in
the absence and presence of CDF (0.5 mmol/L) for 18 hours and
then photographed with a Nikon Eclipse TS100 microscope.
Sphere formation assay
Sphere formation assay was conducted to assess the capacity of CSC self-renewal, as described previously (18). Brieﬂy,
single-cell suspensions of cells were plated on ultra–lowadherent wells of 6-well plate (Corning) at 500 to 1,000
cells/well in sphere formation medium (1:1 DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with B-27 and N-2; Invitrogen). After 7 days,
the spheres termed as "pancreatospheres" were collected by
centrifugation (300  g, 5 minutes) and counted. The proportion of sphere-generating cells was calculated by dividing the
number of cells seeded by the number of pancreatospheres
with the diameter greater than 50 mm.
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was conducted using whole-cell protein lysates of pancreatic cancer cells or tumor tissues. Total
cell lysates from different experiments were obtained by lysing
the cells in protein lysis buffer and 1 protease inhibitor
cocktail, and Western blotting was conducted as described
previously (17, 18).
TaqMan miRNA real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
To determine the expression of miRNAs (let-7 family, miR26a, miR-101, and miR-200 family) in the cells or tumor
samples, we used TaqMan MicroRNA Assay kit (Applied

Biosystems) following manufacturer's protocol. Five nanograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed and real-time PCR
reactions were carried out in 10 mL of reaction mixture as
described previously (17, 22) using AB StepOnePlus Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed using Ct
method and were normalized by RNU6B or RNU48 expression
in each sample.
Levels of mRNAs by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
To determine the mRNA expression of EZH2, Notch-1,
EpCAM, Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4, 2 mg of total RNAs extracted
from each sample (pancreatic cancer cells of xenograft tumor
sample) were used for reverse transcription (RT) reaction in 20
mL of reaction volume using a reverse transcription system
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
SYBR Green Assay kit (Applied Biosystems) was used for
real-time PCR reaction, following manufacturer's protocol.
Sequences of PCR primers were described previously
(17, 22). Data were analyzed using Ct method and were
normalized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) expression in each sample.
Transfection of EZH2 siRNA
MiaPaCa-2 cells were plated in 6-well plate overnight and
transfected with 10 mg of EZH2 siRNA or scramble control
siRNA (Applied Biosystems) by ExGen 500 (Fermentas) following the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 hours of transfection, the cells were collected for the cell growth, clonogenic
assay, wound-healing assay, Western blot analysis, or RT-PCR
of miRNAs as described above.

CDF (5 mg/mouse/d), intragastric once daily for 3 weeks. The
tumor tissue from all groups were rapidly frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at 70 C for later use for RNA, protein
extraction, and another portion was ﬁxed in formalin for
histopathologic and immunohistochemical studies.
Immunohistochemistry
Formalin-ﬁxed tumor tissue sections were evaluated by
hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry
was carried out through the core facility of Department of
Pathology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI, as
described previously (23). Brieﬂy, immunohistochemical staining was carried out for the expression of Ki-67 and CD44 using
speciﬁc antibodies followed by staining with appropriate
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies. The
slides were developed in diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. The stained slides were dehydrated
and mounted in Permount solution and visualized using an
Olympus microscope. Images were captured with an attached
camera linked to the computer.
Statistical analysis
The data with mean and SD in this study were calculated
using GraphPad Prism software (version 4.03). Comparisons of
each treatment outcome were carried out for statistical difference by the paired t test. Statistical signiﬁcance was
assumed at a value of P < 0.05.

Results

Transfection of miRNA precursor miR-101
A total of 2  105 cells per well of MiaPaCa-2 cells were
seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with pre-miR-101 or
miRNA-negative control (Ambion) at a ﬁnal concentration of
20 nmol/L using DharmaFECT transfection reagent (Dharmacon), following the manufacturer's protocol, and as described
previously (21). After 3 days of transfection, the transfected
cells were harvested for total RNA isolation or protein extraction. The relative levels of miRNA, mRNAs, and proteins were
measured as described above.

Effect of CDF on cell survival of pancreatic cancer cells
To investigate the effect of CDF on cell survival of pancreatic
cancer cells, we conducted MTT assays using AsPC-1,
MiaPaCa-2 cells, and MiaPaCa-2 tumor sphere cells. The
results indicate that CDF signiﬁcantly inhibited cell survival
in a dose-dependent manner in AsPC-1, MiaPaCa-2 cells, and
MiaPaCa-2 tumor sphere cells (Fig. 1A). These results suggests
that CDF could exert a pronounced cell growth–inhibitory
effect on pancreatic cancer cell growth and proliferation,
which is consistent with our previously published reports
(17, 18).

Animal experiments
The animal protocol was approved by the Animal Investigation Committee, Wayne State University. Female CB17
severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice (4 weeks old)
were purchased from Taconic Farms and fed Lab Diet 5021
(Purina Mills, Inc.). Initially, 1  106 MiaPaCa-2 cells or 5,000
pancreatospheres of MiaPaCa-2 were implanted in xenograft
mouse model for comparison of protein expression between
cells, xenograft tumor, and xenograft pancreatospheres. The
tumors were removed and protein was extracted. For the
actual therapeutic experiment, 1  106 MiaPaCa-2 cells
were orthotopically implanted into the pancreas of the mice.
One mouse was sacriﬁced after 2 weeks to conﬁrm the growth
of the tumor and were then randomly divided into 3 groups
with 7 animals in each group: (i) untreated control; (ii) CDF
(2.5 mg/mouse/d), intragastric once daily for 3 weeks; and (iii)

Characterization of parental MiaPaCa-2 cells and
tumors derived from either MiaPaCa-2 parental cells or
MiaPaCa-2 sphere cells
We assessed the mRNA expressions of CSC markers such as
EZH2, Lin28B, Nanog, and EpCAM in the parental MiaPaCa-2
cells, the MiaPaCa-2 sphere cells, and the MiaPaCa-2 tumor
sphere cells. We found that the relative mRNA expressions of
EZH2, Lin28B, Nanog, and EpCAM were signiﬁcantly higher in
the tumor sphere cells (Fig. 1B). We also assessed the protein
expression of CSC markers such as EpCAM, Lin28B, Nanog, and
EZH2 in the parental MiaPaCa-2 cells and tumors derived from
either the MiaPaCa-2 parental cells or MiaPaCa-2 sphere cells
(also called as tumor sphere cells). We found that the relative
expressions of EpCAM, Lin28B, EZH2, and Nanog were significantly lower in the parental MiaPaCa-2 cells and tumors
derived from MiaPaCa-2 parental cells (Fig. 1C), whereas the

tumors derived from the MiaPaCa-2 pancreatospheres.
Therefore, to examine the effect of CDF on self-renewal
capacity of CSCs or CSC-like cells, we conducted sphere
formation assay of the cells derived from the xenograft
tumors established using pancreatospheres of MiaPaCa-2
cells (second generation of pancreatospheres or tumor
sphere cells). We found signiﬁcant inhibition of secondary
pancreatospheres formation by CDF treatment in a

dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). These results clearly
documents that CDF can inhibit the formation of pancreatospheres, suggesting that CDF could indeed attenuate CSC
function. We also examined the effect of CDF on EZH2
mRNA which is overexpressed in CSCs such as MiaPaCa-2
tumor sphere cells. The results showed that CDF could
signiﬁcantly inhibit the expression of EZH2 mRNA in tumor
sphere cells (Fig. 1E).

cells and the wound-healing capacity (D) of MiaPaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells. The transfection of EZH2 siRNA was conducted in MiaPaCa-2 cells. The transfected
cells were then collected for cell growth assay, Western blot analysis, clonogenic assay, and wound-healing assay as described under the Materials and
Methods section. CDF decreased the wound-healing capacity (D) and EZH2 expression (E) in pancreatic cancer cells after 18 hours of treatment.

remarkably decreased the expression of ABCG2 and Hes-1 in
MiaPaCa-2 cells. We also found that CDF was very effective in
inhibiting the expression of MMP-9, a biomarker for tumor
metastasis, in AsPC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 2A).
Effect of CDF on the expression of miRNAs in AsPC-1 and
MiaPaCa-2 cells by real-time RT-PCR
We examined the effect of CDF on the expression of miRNAs
(let-7 family, miR-21, miR-26a, miR-101, miR-146a, and miR200b) in pancreatic cancer cells. The results revealed that CDF
treatment caused reexpression of the miRNAs such as let-7a,b,
c,d, miR-26a, miR-101, miR-146a, and miR-200b that are lost in
AsPC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, miR-21
expression was very high in the AsPC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells
and CDF was able to downregulate its expression. These data
suggest that CDF differentially regulate the expression of these
tumor-associated miRNAs in pancreatic cancer cells.
Effect of EZH2 deﬁciency on cell growth, clonogenicity,
and cell migration of pancreatic cancer cells
To investigate the role of EZH2 in the regulation of cell
growth, clonogenicity, and cell migration of pancreatic cancer
cells, we carried out the EZH2 siRNA transfection experiments

340

Cancer Res; 72(1) January 1, 2012

using MiaPaCa-2 cells. We found that EZH2 siRNA transfection
resulted in decreased expression of EZH2, but most interestingly, the knockdown of EZH2 led to decreased expression of
Nanog, CD44, Notch-1, and cleaved Notch-1 expression
(Fig. 3A). The downregulation of EZH2 resulted in decreased
cell growth (Fig. 3B), decreased clonogenicity (Fig. 3C), and
decreased cell migration (Fig. 3D). CDF decreased cell migration in MiaPaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells after 18 hours of treatment
(Fig. 3D). The Western blot analysis shows that CDF also
decreased the expression of EZH2 in MiaPaCa-2 cells after
18 hours of treatment (Fig. 3E). These results suggest that
EZH2 mediates cell growth, clonogenicity, and cell migration
of pancreatic cancer cells and that the inhibition of cell
growth/survival, clonogenicity, cell migration by CDF treatment is indeed mediated through the downregulation of EZH2
in pancreatic cancer cells.
Effect of EZH2 siRNA on the expression of miRNAs (let-7
family, miR-26a, miR-101, and miR-200b) in MiaPaCa-2
cells
We examined the effect of EZH2 inactivation by EZH2 siRNA
on the expression of miRNAs (let-7 family, miR-26a, miR-101,
and miR-200b,c) in MiaPaCa-2 cells by real-time RT-PCR.

Targeting miRNA-Mediated Inactivation of EZH2 by CDF

Figure 4. Effect of EZH2 siRNA on the expression of miRNAs in MiaPaCa2 cells. After 72 hours of the transfection with EZH2 siRNA, the
transfected cells were collected for real-time RT-PCR for assessing the
expression of miRNAs as described under the Materials and Methods
section.

We found that the inactivation of EZH2 led to reexpression
of let-7 family, miR-26a, miR-101, and miR-200c which are
typically lost in pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 4), and these
results are consistent with CDF treatment results as presented
above in Fig. 2B.
The role of miR-101 in the regulation of EZH2, EpCAM,
Sox2, Oct4, and Notch-1 in MiaPaCa-2 cells
To investigate the role of miR-101 in the regulation of CSC
marker genes, we carried out transfection experiment using
miR-101 precursor. We found that the transfection of miR-101
precursor led to increased expression of miR-101 as expected,
which led to decreased expression of EZH2 and EpCAM

proteins in MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 5A). Moreover, we found that
the reexpression of miR-101 also led to decreased mRNA
expression of EZH2, EpCAM, Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4 mRNAs
in MiaPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 5B), which suggests that miR-101
plays a key role in the regulation of CSC marker genes such
as EZH2, EpCAM, Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4.

Effect of CDF on tumor growth and on the expression of
EZH2, CD44, EpCAM, Notch-1, and Nanog in tumor
remnants in vivo
We carried out animal experiment using orthotopic mouse
model of pancreatic cancer in which the tumors were derived
from MiaPaCa-2 cells injected into the pancreas. We found that
group with 5 mg CDF per mouse could signiﬁcantly decrease
tumor size and weight, compared with the control group or
group with 2.5 mg CDF per mouse (Fig. 6A), which is consistent
with our previous ﬁndings (17). Interestingly, we found that
CDF treatment could decrease the protein expression of EZH2,
CD44, EpCAM, Notch-1, and Nanog in pancreatic tumor remnant (Fig. 6B). Immunohistochemical study of pancreatic
tumors revealed that the intensity scores of Ki-67 and CD44
from the control and CDF groups were 3 and 2, respectively,
indicating that CDF treatment reduced the expression of Ki-67
and CD44, in pancreatic tumor tissue remnants (Fig. 6C).

tumors on both the mRNA and miRNA expression in tumor

remnants. We found that CDF treatment signiﬁcantly
decreased the relative mRNA levels of EZH2, Notch-1, Nanog,
and Oct4 in pancreatic tumor tissues (Fig. 7A), suggesting that
CDF could inhibit the mRNA expression of these CSC marker
genes in vivo. Similarly, we also found that CDF treatment led to
increased expression of let-7 family, miR-26a, and miR-101
in tumor tissue remnants (Fig. 7B) and these in vivo results
are consistent with our in vitro ﬁndings.

Discussion
Emerging evidence suggests that EZH2 plays a key role in
tumorigenesis by maintaining stem cell function including
CSCs through epigenetic repression of cell fate–regulating
genes and tumor suppressor genes (8, 14, 16). Increased
expression of EZH2 has been observed in variety of tumors.
For example, in prostate cancer, the overexpression of EZH2
was associated with aggressive and metastatic disease (11, 24).
Similarly, in breast cancer, the expression of EZH2 was found to
be elevated in invasive and metastatic tumor, and its increased
expression was positively associated with poor prognosis (25,
26). The increased expression of EZH2 has also been found in

Targeting miRNA-Mediated Inactivation of EZH2 by CDF

Figure 7. CDF decreased the mRNA expression of EZH2, Notch-1, Nanog, and Oct4 in pancreatic tumor tissues (A), and increased miRNA expression of
let-7a,b,c, miR-26a, and miR-10 in pancreatic tumors (B) derived from human pancreatic cancer MiaPaCa-2 cell–induced tumor implanted orthotopically in
the pancreas of severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice, and real-time RT-PCR was carried out as described under the Materials and Methods section.

other tumors including pancreatic cancer (26, 27). Recently,
EZH2 has been identiﬁed to be associated with tumor angiogenesis, the self-renewal capacity, and the gene expression of
CSC markers associated with tumor aggressiveness (12, 26, 28–
31). In our current study, we have shown that the decreased
EZH2 expression using EZH2 siRNA transfection led to
decreased cell proliferation, migration, and the protein expressions of CSC markers such as Nanog, CD44, and Notch-1 in
pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, EZH2 deﬁciency led to
increased expression of miRNAs such as let-7a,b,c,d, miR26a, miR-101, and miR-200 in pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that these miRNAs are involved in the regulation of EZH2
and that inactivation of EZH2 could contribute to inhibit
tumor aggressiveness. Our results on the effects of CDF on
pancreatospheres formation of tumor cells derived from the

tumors induced by the pancreatospheres of MiaPaCa-2 cells,
clearly suggest that CSCs could be eliminated by CDF by
attenuating EZH2 and other CSC-speciﬁc genes through reexpression of miRNAs.
As documented earlier that miRNAs function as endogenous
posttranscriptional gene regulators by speciﬁc binding to the 30
untranslated region (30 -UTR) of target mRNAs to mediate
protein synthesis or mRNA stability (32, 33). The miRNAs are
currently recognized as important and key regulators of the
expression of most genes, and consequently, they play critical
roles in wide variety of biologic processes, including cell
differentiation, proliferation, death, metabolism, and energy
homeostasis (33, 34). A large number of miRNAs have been
reported to be associated with tumorigenesis by regulation of
the expression/transcription of many tumor-related genes

(35). Emerging evidence suggests that miRNAs may play an
important role in the regulation of stem cell function in tumors
including pancreatic cancer (36). However, their exact roles in
the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer are not fully understood.
Moreover, it has been reported that the let-7 family function as
a potential tumor suppressor and has been found to be downregulated in tumors, resulting in enhanced expression of Ras
and c-Myc in tumor cells (35, 37, 38). In addition, the downregulation of let-7 has been observed in pancreatic cancer
(35, 38). A recent study has shown that the expression of CSC
marker genes could be regulated bidirectionally and associated
with the downregulation of let-7 expression (39), suggesting
that let-7 may play a role in the regulation of CSC function. Our
ﬁndings clearly show that inactivation of EZH2 led to increased
let-7 expression, and thus CDF-mediated reexpression of let-7
family of miRNAs could be responsible for the biologic effects
of CDF in pancreatic cancer cells and tumors.
Emerging evidence also suggests that miR-200 serve as a
potential tumor suppressor, primarily by repressing the acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype during the development and progression of tumors
(17, 22, 35, 40, 41). Decreased expression of miR-200 has been
observed in many tumors including pancreatic cancer, which is
associated with tumor invasion and metastasis (35, 42, 43). The
in vitro studies revealed that the downregulation of miR-200
enhances the acquisition of EMT phenotype in the cancer cells
and that reexpression of miR-200 results in the reversal of EMT
phenotype (44), which is consistent with our previous ﬁndings
in pancreatic cancer cells as summarized in our recent review
article (36). A recent study has shown that loss of miR-200b
increases breast CSC growth and invasive capacity by targeting
CSC gene Suz12, suggesting a key role of miR-200 in the
deregulation of CSC function (45). Our results on the EZH2
siRNA transfection study showed that the inhibition of EZH2
led to increased expression of let-7 and miR-200 in pancreatic
cancer cells, suggesting that EZH2 could be involved in the
regulation of let-7 and miR-200 in cancer cells and that CDF
could lead to the reexpression of let-7 and miR-200, which
would be highly valuable in reverting tumor cell aggressiveness
or in the killing of CSCs.
Furthermore, miR-26a and miR-101 are known potential
tumor suppressors and have been reported to modulate the
cancer epigenome by repressing the polycomb group protein,
EZH2 (9, 10, 30, 46–48). Decreased expression of miR-26a and

miR-101 has been found in a wide variety of cancers such as
gastric cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, and pancreatic cancer (49). Reexpression of miR26a or miR-101 in cancer cells leads to the downregulation of
EZH2, resulting in the inhibition of tumor metastasis and
invasion (9, 30, 47, 50). Our ﬁndings showed that reexpression
of miR-101 results in the downregulation in the expression of
EZH2 and EpCAM and that inactivation of EZH2 results in the
upregulation of miR-101 in pancreatic cancer cells, showing a
negative mutual feedback loop of EZH2 and miR-101. These
ﬁndings are also consistent with treatment of cells with CDF,
suggesting that miRNAs that are lost in pancreatic cancer cells
could be reexpressed using our novel agent CDF (18, 19). In our
previous reports, we showed that CDF inhibited tumor growth
by attenuating multiple targets such as NF-kB, Akt, COX-2
signaling pathways, EMT phenotype and CSC function, PTEN,
miR-21, and miR-200 in vitro and in vivo (17, 18), which is
consistent with our current ﬁndings showing that CDF could
inhibit the expression of EZH2, Notch-1, and Oct4 through
reexpression of let-7a,b,c,d, miR-26a, and miR-101 in the pancreatic cancer cells as well as in tumor remnants. Collectively,
our results together with our published reports clearly suggest
that CDF could be a useful agent for the prevention of tumor
progression and/or treatment of pancreatic cancer which
would be accomplished by attenuating CSC function and
overcoming therapeutic resistance.
