Abstract

Introduction

Extensive evidence implicates activation of the lipid phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in the genesis and
progression of various human cancers. PI3K inhibitors thus
have considerable potential as molecular cancer therapeutics.
Here, we detail the pharmacologic properties of a prototype of a new series of inhibitors of class I PI3K. PI103 is a
potent inhibitor with low IC50 values against recombinant
PI3K isoforms p110A (2 nmol/L), p110B (3 nmol/L), p110D
(3 nmol/L), and p110; (15 nmol/L). PI103 also inhibited TORC1
by 83.9% at 0.5 Mmol/L and exhibited an IC50 of 14 nmol/L
against DNA-PK. A high degree of selectivity for the PI3K family
was shown by the lack of activity of PI103 in a panel of 70
protein kinases. PI103 potently inhibited proliferation and
invasion of a wide variety of human cancer cells in vitro and
showed biomarker modulation consistent with inhibition of
PI3K signaling. PI103 was extensively metabolized, but distributed rapidly to tissues and tumors. This resulted in tumor
growth delay in eight different human cancer xenograft models
with various PI3K pathway abnormalities. Decreased phosphorylation of AKT was observed in U87MG gliomas, consistent
with drug levels achieved. We also showed inhibition of
invasion in orthotopic breast and ovarian cancer xenograft
models and obtained evidence that PI103 has antiangiogenic
potential. Despite its rapid in vivo metabolism, PI103 is a
valuable tool compound for exploring the biological function of
class I PI3K and importantly represents a lead for further
optimization of this novel class of targeted molecular cancer
therapeutic. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5840–50]

The lipid kinase family of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)
are responsible for the generation of 3-phosphorylated inositides,
including the important second messenger PtIns(3,4,5)P3, resulting
in activation of signal transduction pathways implicated in many
physiologic processes (1–4). The class I enzymes, the most well
characterized of the PI3K to date, are divided into class IA (p110a,
p110h, and p110y) and class IB (p110g) according to their structure
and interaction with p85 and p55 regulatory subunits (1, 5).
Deregulation of the PI3K pathway has been reported in a significant
proportion of cancers. For example, overexpression of p110a has
been shown in ovarian, small cell lung, cervical, glioblastoma, head
and neck, and bladder cancers (6–10). Activating mutations of the
PIK3CA gene encoding p110a have been identified in a large
number of cancers, including ovarian, breast, colon, and glioblastoma; in some cases, these were shown to be oncogenic (11–14). In
addition to a role for p110a, recent studies have shown that
oncogenic transformation can be induced by all other class I
isoforms (15). An alternative form of pathway activation results
from the mutation of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on
chromosome 10 (PTEN), the gene that encodes the phosphatase that
dephosphorylates the 3-phosphoinositides. This is the second most
frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene after p53 (16).
Downstream of the lipid phosphorylation step regulated by PI3K
and PTEN, AKT is amplified and overexpressed in ovarian, breast,
and pancreatic cancers (17, 18), and TSC2 mutations inhibit the
formation of the tumor suppression complex TSC1-2 (19). Upstream
of PI3K, growth factor receptors are mutated, overexpressed, or
activated in many cancers (20). Furthermore, there is accumulating
evidence to implicate PI3K-regulated signaling in angiogenesis and
metastasis (21–24). Altogether, the frequency of deregulation of this
pathway suggests that the lipid kinases that produce PtIns(3,4,5)P3
are attractive targets for cancer drug discovery (25). A number of
chemical inhibitors of the PI3K family have been developed, but
these either lack potency or specificity or exhibit unsuitable
pharmaceutical properties (26). The most frequently used inhibitors
to date are the natural product wortmannin and the flavone
LY294002. Recently, however, more drug-like inhibitors have been
described. PWT-458 is a pegylated derivative of wortmannin, an
unstable and broad-spectrum natural product PI3K inhibitor, that
has been shown to suppress growth of U87MG glioma in vitro and
in vivo with a concomitant decrease in phosphorylation of AKT (27).
A series of semisynthetic derivatives of the natural product viridins
have also been described, of which PX-866 has shown antitumor

Pharmacology of a PI3K Inhibitor

efficacy in A549 lung carcinoma and OVCAR-3 ovarian carcinoma
xenografts and also potentiated the effects of gefitinib (28, 29).
A triazine derivative, ZSTK474, was described as a potent PI3K
inhibitor with antitumor activity in A549 lung adenocarcinoma, PC3
prostate adenocarcinoma, and WiDr colorectal carcinoma xenografts following oral administration (30).
We previously reported the discovery of three new series of PI3K
inhibitors (31–33). Here, we describe the detailed pharmacologic
properties of a novel synthetic small molecule of the pyridofuropyrimidine class, PI103, which is a potent and selective inhibitor
of class I PI3K (31). Inhibition of human cancer cell growth in vitro
by PI103 is associated with pharmacodynamic biomarker effects
consistent with target inhibition. PI103 shows antitumor activity
in vivo in several human tumor xenograft models, including
cancers with documented abnormalities in the PI3K pathway, in
which pharmacodynamic effects were also observed. In addition,
PI103 inhibits tumor cell invasion both in vitro and in vivo and also
blocks endothelial cell function and vascularization of human
tumor xenografts. As this study was being completed, PI103 was
also shown in a chemical biology and screening approach to
exhibit selective inhibition of the PI3K pathway and to inhibit
proliferation of human glioma cells (34–36). PI103 represents an
exploratory compound for investigating the therapeutic relevance
of PI3K inhibitors in cancers with a variety of genetic aberrations in
the pathway and is a lead for further optimization of a novel class
of targeted molecular cancer therapeutic.

Materials and Methods
Compound supply. PI103 was synthesized originally at Astellas
Pharmaceuticals (32). Recent batches were provided by PIramed Ltd. All
batches had similar potency and selectivity.
Enzyme assays. Enzyme assays were done using human recombinant
enzymes. A scintillation proximity radiometric assay was done in the
presence of 1 Amol/L ATP (31, 32). IC50 values were determined by fitting a
sigmoidal dose-response and represent means of three experiments. The
selectivity against a panel of 70 kinases was assessed at a concentration of
10 Amol/L (Upstate).
Cell culture. The human cell lines U87MG, HCT116, HT29, PC-3, MDAMB-468, MDA-MB-435, A549, SKOV-3, MDA-MB-435, IGROV-1, OVCAR-3,
and Detroit 562 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
A2780 cells were obtained from the European Collection of Cell Cultures. All
cell lines were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen Ltd.) containing 2 mmol/L
glutamine (Life Technologies) with 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin (Life Technologies) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (PAA) in 5% CO2 in air at 37jC. Human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (pooled HUVEC) and their appropriate growth medium and supplements were obtained from TCS CellWorks. Cells were cultured according to
the supplier’s instructions and used at passages 3 to 8. Cell viability was
routinely greater than 90%, as judged by trypan blue exclusion. All cell lines
routinely tested negative for Mycoplasma by PCR. The GI50 values were
determined using a sulfurhodamine blue assay following 96 h of continuous
exposure (37).
Immunoblotting and immunoassay. Cells were treated with 1 or 5
GI50 PI103 for various times, and protein extracts were prepared by washing
the cells once in ice-cold PBS and then lysing with cell lysis buffer (Cell
Signaling Technologies), supplemented with protease inhibitors (Boehringer/
Roche). Determination of protein concentration was done using BCA Protein
Assay kit (Pierce). Tumors were snap frozen using liquid nitrogen
immediately following excision and stored at 80jC until processed. They
were homogenized into a fine power under liquid nitrogen using a model
6750 freezer mill (Glen Crestor). Ground powder was immediately
resuspended in lysis buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L
Tris (pH 7.4), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L sodium

orthovanadate, 10 mg/mL TLCK, 5 Amol/L fenvalerate, 5 Amol/L bpVphen,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease cocktail (1:100), phosphatase cocktail I and II (1:50)] by aspirating through a 23-gauge needle. Samples
were incubated on ice and centrifuged at 1,500  g for 10 min, and the
supernatants were recovered and aliquoted.
Equal amounts of protein were separated by electrophoresis through
NuPage Bis-Tris 4% to 12% gradient gels (Invitrogen); proteins were
transferred onto nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene difluoride (0.45 Am) pore
membranes using the NuPage system and protocol from Invitrogen.
Antibodies were obtained from the following suppliers: phosphorylated
AKT (p-AKT) Ser473, p-AKT Thr308, p-GSK3h Ser9, GSK3h, cleaved
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Cell Signaling Technologies), cyclin
D1 (NeoMarkers), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Chemicon
International). All antibodies were used as recommended by the
manufacturer, and specific antigen-antibody interaction was detected with
a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody IgG using
enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences).
Electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. A Meso Scale Discovery
system was used to measure the levels of AKT activation in tumors
following exposure to PI103. Multi-spot p-AKT Ser473/total AKT assays were
performed with 10 Ag protein in duplicate. The protocol used was as
recommended by the manufacturer except that samples were incubated on
the plates overnight before addition of secondary antibody.
Flow cytometry. DNA histograms were generated by flow cytometry
analysis. Cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 min at
4jC. Fixed cells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in PBS containing
100 mg/mL RNase A and 40 mg/mL propidium iodide, and incubated for
30 min at 37jC. All samples were analyzed on a Beckman Coulter EPICS
Elite ESP flow cytometer. Data were analyzed, and histograms were plotted
using winMDI version 2.5 flow cytometry application software (Scripps
Institute).
Measurement of caspase activation. Activation of apoptotic effector
caspases that cleave the DEVD (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp) motif was assayed using a
non-fluorescent caspase substrate Z-DEVD-R110 that releases fluorescent
rhodamine-110 when cleaved by caspases that recognise the DEVD motif.
Briefly, cells were seeded at 4,000 per well in a 96-well plate and treated
24 h later with inhibitors or vehicle control for 1 to 3 days. Caspase activity
was assessed by adding an equal volume of reagent and substrate
(Promega), incubating for 16 h, and measuring rhodamine-110 fluorescence
at 535 nm following excitation at 485 nm using a Victor 1420 plate reader
(Perkin-Elmer).
Localization assays. Redistribution assays of green fluorescent protein
(GFP)–tagged proteins were done at Bioimage.6 Briefly, the effects of the
inhibitors on cellular translocation of FKHR, AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, and PDK1
were compared with those of wortmannin. The FKHR redistribution assay
was done in U2OS cells cultured with 0.7% serum, and all other assays were
done in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in 0.05% serum with 0.1% bovine
serum albumin following stimulation with 100 nmol/L insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1). Fluorescence was monitored with an In-Cell Analyser
(Amersham). Concentration-response curves were derived from Prism 3.02
(GraphPad), and IC50 values were determined. Z¶ factors were above 0.5.
Pharmacokinetics and metabolism. Microsomes (mouse or human)
were obtained from Tebu-Bio and incubated for 30 min with 1 or 10 Amol/L
inhibitor as described (38). All animal experiments were done in accordance
with local requirements for animal experimentation and national United
Kingdom Co-ordinating Committee on Cancer Research guidelines (39).
Female BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old; Charles River) were dosed i.v. with
2.5 mg/kg PI103 in 10% DMSO, 0.5% Tween 20 in saline, or 50 mg/kg PI103
in 20% 4-hydroxypropyl h-cyclodextrin in saline at 0.1 mL/10 g i.p. Blood
was collected after serial bleeding and centrifuged, and the plasma was
frozen at 80j C. Tissues were snap frozen in dry ice and kept at 80jC
until analysis.

Cancer Research
Quantitative analysis was done by liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using multiple reaction monitoring on a
ThermoFinnigan TSQ 700 equipped with an electrospray ionization source.
Chromatographic separation was achieved by a Waters system (Wisp 717
autosampler and 600 MS pump and gradient former) on a Discovery C18
column (Sigma-Aldrich; 5 cm  4.6 mm inner diameter) with a 4-min 20 to
100 linear gradient of methanol in 0.1% formic acid following a 3-min
isocratic period at 0.6 mL/min. The following transitions were monitored
(341.9 > 261.9 at 35 V, 554 > 362 at 40 V). Quantitation was done versus
external calibration at the level of 2 to 20,000 nmol/L (8 points). Quality
controls were included at concentrations of 15, 750, and 5,000 nmol/L.
Aliquots (100 AL) of mouse plasma were added to 10 AL of internal standard
(an analogue of PI103, used at concentrations of 5,000 nmol/L) and
precipitated with 3 volumes of methanol. Following centrifugation at 2,500
 g for 5 min, 20 AL supernatant was analyzed. Tissues were homogenized
in 2 or 3 volumes PBS and treated as plasma. Quantitation was done on
Excalibur software. The assay was linear over the range of concentrations
analyzed (r > 0.99).
Qualitative measurements (metabolite detection and characterization)
were done by LC-MS/MS on a Thermoseparation AS3000 autosampler,
P4000 quaternary pump, and UV1000 detector attached to a LCQ ion trap
(ThermoFinnigan). Samples were separated using the same column as
above with a slower gradient of 10% to 90% methanol over 6 min after
0.5-min isocratic at 1 mL/min. The scan range was 50 to 1,000 amu.
Pharmacokinetic calculations were done using WinNonlin noncompartmental analysis model 201 for plasma following i.v. administration and
model 200 for tissues and plasma following i.p. administration (40).
Human tumor xenograft efficacy and pharmacodynamic studies. For
s.c. tumor xenograft models, 2  106 cells were injected s.c., bilaterally, into
female (or in the case of PC3 prostate tumors, male) NCr athymic mice 6 to
8 weeks of age, bred in-house. The breast carcinomas were inoculated into
mammary fat pads. Dosing commenced when tumors were established (f5
mm mean diameter) for the period indicated. PI103 was prepared in 20%
4-hydroxypropyl h-cyclodextrin and injected i.p. Tumors were measured
across two perpendicular diameters, and volumes were obtained from the
following formula: V = 4/3p [(d 1 + d 2) / 4]3 (41).
When the experiment was terminated, mice were bled, plasma samples
were prepared, and tumors were excised and weighed; % treated/control
(T/C) values were calculated from final tumor weights or, in the case of
HCT116 carcinoma, from tumor volumes on the last day of therapy because
tumors were allowed to grow out to observe recovery. Tumor samples were
snap frozen for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic analysis and, in
some cases, cryopreserved or fixed for histologic examination. In the latter
case, samples were sectioned and stained with H&E using standard
techniques. For examination of vasculature, tumors were stained with rat
anti-mouse endothelial antibody MECA 32 with goat anti-rat horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody as previously described (42).
OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells were passaged in vivo, and 5  106 cells
were injected i.p. into female Ncr nu mice. Therapy commenced 15 days
later and continued daily until day 30. Mice were sacrificed 15 min, and
4 h after the last drug dose, tumor burden was calculated, and samples
taken for pharmacodynamic analysis by Western blotting. Visceral organs
were examined for evidence of tumor invasion both macroscopically and by
histology. In separate pharmacodynamic studies, mice bearing established
OVCAR-3 orthotopic ascites tumors or s.c. U87MG glioblastoma xenografts
were given two doses of 100 mg/kg PI103 in h-cyclodextrin vehicle i.p.
before harvesting of tumor samples for p-AKT electrochemiluminescent
immunoassay analysis at intervals after the final dose.
Cell migration and invasion assays. Cells were labeled by incubation
with the green fluorescent dye Celltracker green 5-chloromethylfluorescein
diacetate (Invitrogen) at 1 Amol/L for 1 h. Cells (2  104 in 350 AL serum-free
media) were then placed into the upper well of an 8-Am pore Fluoroblok
membrane insert in 24-well companion plates (BD Biosciences) in DMEM
vehicle or various concentrations of PI103. Medium (800 AL) containing 5%
heat-inactivated FCS was added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant.
The assay plates were incubated at 37jC in 5% CO2 for 16 to 24 h (tumor cells)
or 4 h (HUVEC). An inverted fluorescent microscope and digital camera

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

(Olympus LX70) were used to obtain images of the migrated cells on the
underside of the membrane. Three different fields of view were scored for
each well. The number of migrated cells was calculated using Image Pro-Plus
4.0 software (Media Cybernetics). Invasion was assayed in a similar fashion
using inserts coated with Matrigel. The observation period was extended to
36 h for tumor cells and 18 h for HUVEC.

Results
PI103 is a selective class I PI3K inhibitor. PI103 was
synthesized following a high-throughput screen to identify
inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of recombinant PI3K p110a
(32). PI103 potently and competitively inhibited all class IA
isoforms, a, h, and y, with IC50 values of 2, 3, and 3 nmol/L,
respectively. It is f200-fold more potent than the commonly used
broad-spectrum PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (IC50 = 500, 580, and
600 nmol/L against p110a, p110h, and p110y, respectively). PI103
exhibited 5- to 7-fold less activity against the class IB p110g
isoform (IC50 = 15 nmol/L) and DNA-PK (IC50 = 14 nmol/L), a
member of the PI3K superfamily, as well as 15- to 20-fold less
activity against the class II PI3K C2h (IC50 = 43 nmol/L). In
addition, there was at least 1,300-fold selectivity over the class III
PI3K Vsp34 (IC50 = 3,950 nmol/L). PI103 inhibited TORC1 (83.9%
inhibition at 0.5 Amol/L), consistent with recent data (33). There
was no inhibition of PKCa or PKA at concentrations of 1 Amol/L.
PI103 was also screened against a panel of 70 protein kinases that
are representative of the human kinome and containing a number
of oncogenic proteins such as cyclin-dependent kinases, receptor
tyrosine kinases, and kinases involved in the regulation of signal
transduction, including AKT. Little or no inhibitory activity was
seen at 10 Amol/L PI103, indicating a high degree of selectivity for
the PI3K superfamily (data not shown).
PI103 inhibits the PI3K pathway and proliferation of cancer
cells in vitro. Figure 1A shows the cellular GI50 values of PI103,
evaluated in a panel of human cancer cell lines comprising
prostate, lung, ovary, colon, and breast cancer, glioblastoma, and
oropharyngeal carcinoma and following 96 h of continuous
treatment with PI103. These cell lines have different genetic
abnormalities that can result in activation of the PI3K pathway
(e.g., PTEN deletion or a PI3K p110a mutation within the kinase or
other regulatory domains; refs. 11, 13, 43–46). PI103 exhibited a
range of GI50 values from 0.06 to 0.93 Amol/L compared with 4.60
to 12.10 Amol/L for LY294002. Thus, the greater potency of PI103
on the molecular target was also carried over into enhanced
growth inhibition in cancer cells. PI103 showed activity in cell lines
with wild-type and mutant PTEN and retained potency in cells with
mutant PIK3CA. These included the Detroit 562 oropharyngeal
carcinoma cell line that harbors the mutant PIK3CA H1047R, the
HCT116 colorectal carcinoma line with an H1047R mutation in the
kinase domain, the A2780 ovarian carcinoma line with a C2 domain
mutation, and the IGROV-1 ovarian carcinoma with a p85 binding
domain mutation and stop 1069W mutation resulting in extension
of the protein by four amino acids (A2780 and IGROV; data not
shown; ref. 11).
Similar to LY294002, treatment with PI103 resulted in a time- and
concentration-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of AKT
Ser473 in all cell lines (Fig. 1A and B; Supplementary Fig. S1A
and B). Figure 1B shows decreased phosphorylation of AKT Ser473
following treatment of HCT116 human colorectal carcinoma cells
with increasing PI103 (1–10 GI50) or of U87MG glioblastoma and
PC3 prostate cancer cells (1 and 5 GI50; Supplementary Fig. S1A

C, immunoblot analysis of U87MG cells
treated with 5 GI50 concentration of PI103
for 2 h. Cells were then washed in PBS and
cultured in PI103-free medium. Samples
were analyzed after 15 and 60 min of
exposure and 15 and 60 min after removal
of PI103 and addition of PI103-free
medium. Note: a batch of total AKT
antibody was found to preferentially
recognized the unphosphorylated form
relative to the phosphorylated form.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate

the loading control. D, PI103 treatment

and B). The effects of PI103 on the downstream components of the
PI3K pathway were rapid, with inhibition of phosphorylation of AKT
Ser473 and Thr308 and GSK3h Ser9 occurring within 15 min of
treatment (Fig. 1C). This was followed by an equally rapid recovery
15 min after PI103 was removed and the cells were transferred to
drug-free medium.
The effects of PI103 on the redistribution of a forkhead
transcription factor (FKHR), PDK1, AKT1, AKT2, or AKT3 following
stimulation with IGF-1 were measured in U20S human osteosarcoma cells expressing FKHR fused to GFP or CHO cells expressing
PDK1, AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3 fused to GFP. Activation of PI3K and
production of PIP3 result in recruitment of PDK1 and AKT to the
plasma membrane via their PH domains (45). Activated AKT
subsequently phosphorylates a number of substrates (including
FKHR) that prevents their translocation from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus (46). Consistent with inhibition of PI3K signaling, PI103
induced the redistribution of GFP-tagged FKHR from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus (IC50 = 30 nmol/L) in U2OS cells
(Fig. 1D, left) and inhibited the localization of GFP-AKT1, GFP-

cells with IC50 values of 17, 13, 11, and 66 nmol/L respectively
(Fig. 1D, right, AKT2; Supplementary Fig. S1C). PI103 had a similar
potency to wortmannin in all of these assays; in contrast, LY294002
was less potent, with 200-fold higher IC50 values (data not shown).
PI103 also decreased cyclin D1 expression as early as 4 h post
treatment in U87MG cells (Fig. 2A). This was consistent with a
time- and concentration-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest that was

were not apparent following PI103 treatment (Fig. 1B). The
induction of apoptosis by LY294002, but not PI103, was confirmed
in HCT116 cells by direct measurement of the activation of the
apoptotic effector proteases (caspases) following 1 to 3 days of
exposure of up to 10 GI50 (Fig. 2D).
Pharmacokinetics and metabolism of PI103. PI103 was
metabolized by >70% after 30 min of incubation with human and
mouse microsomes under standard conditions (Fig. 3A). The main
metabolite was the glucuronide of PI103 formed on the phenol
ring, representing on average 57% of the total metabolites. In
addition, a hydroxylated product on the morpholino moiety and a
hydroxylated glucuronide were also formed. This resulted in
opening of the morpholino ring, which we observed previously
with LY294002 and other benzochromenone DNA-PK inhibitors
(47, 48).
The concentration versus time curves in plasma, liver, kidney,
and spleen following 2.5 mg/kg PI103 given i.v. to female BALB/C
mice are shown in Fig. 4B. Pharmacokinetics of PI103 showed a
high volume of distribution at steady state (Vss = 0.0516 L). This
was consistent with a very rapid tissue distribution, resulting in
C max occurring 5 min after dosing in liver, kidney, and spleen
(Fig. 3B). The liver to plasma ratio was 1.3 versus 0.7 for kidney and
spleen. The compound cleared from plasma with a rate of 0.19 L/h,
which exceeds liver blood flow (Fig. 3C). Rapid tissue clearance was
also seen.
Following i.p. administration of 50 mg/kg PI103, the apparent
clearance was similar to that observed following i.v. dosing (0.12 L/h),
but the concentrations were sustained in plasma and remained above
GI50 levels for longer than 12 h (Fig. 3D). This contrasts with previous
observations with LY294002, where plasma levels remained above
active levels for only 1 h with comparable tissue distribution to that
of PI103 (47). These encouraging results prompted us to investigate
pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and efficacy effects in tumorbearing animals.
Following 14 daily doses of 40 or 70 mg/kg PI103 i.p. in 20%
4-hydroxypropyl h-cyclodextrin to mice bearing U87MG glioblasto-

ma xenografts, measurement of the peak area ratio of parent to
glucuronide in both plasma and tissue showed extensive glucuronidation with 20-fold more glucuronide than parent compound in
plasma (Fig. 4A). Despite this extensive metabolism, tumor levels of
parent compound were found to be above GI50 levels for 2 h (Fig. 4B).
PI103 decreases AKT phosphorylation in vivo. Following two
doses, 12 h apart, of 100 mg/kg PI103 i.p. in female Ncr nude mice
bearing U87MG human glioblastoma xenografts, there was a
reproducible and significant drop in phosphorylation of AKT on
Ser473 15 min to 2 h after dosing, consistent with inhibition of the
PI3K pathway. The ratio of p-AKT Ser473/total AKT measured by
the electrochemiluminescent immunoassay reached a nadir at
30 to 60 min ( falling to f50% of control levels) and returned to
control levels by 4 h (Fig. 4C). This is consistent with intratumoral
levels of PI103 measured over the same period in this xenograft
model (Fig. 4B).
Antitumor activity in vivo. Given the pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic data described above, we next sought evidence
of therapeutic efficacy in human tumor xenografts selected for
evidence of activation of the PI3K pathway by differing genetic
events. As shown in Fig. 5, PI103 exhibited therapeutic activity at
well-tolerated doses (<15% weight loss) in a number of human
tumor models, including the PTEN null U87MG glioblastoma, PC3
prostate, and MDA-MB-468 breast carcinomas (Fig. 5A and B) and
the PIK3CA mutant HCT 116 colon carcinoma (Fig. 5C). In the case
of the HCT116 colon carcinoma, dosing was terminated on day 14
when the T/C, calculated from tumor volumes, was 68% and 28%
for animals dosed once or twice daily with 30 mg/kg PI103,
respectively. On day 21, when the experiment was terminated, the
tumors in the former group had recovered to control values, but in
the latter group, the T/C was still 48% (Fig. 5D).
In vivo efficacy of PI103 was also assessed in three further
xenograft tumors. These were SKOV3 and IGROV-1 ovarian
carcinomas that have p85 binding domain and kinase domain
mutations of PIK3CA, respectively, as well as the MDA-MB-435
breast carcinoma that overexpresses ERB-B2 (Fig. 5D). Statistically

these experiments and overall in seven tumor models described in
this section (Fig. 5D).
Inhibition of tumor cell and endothelial cell migration and
invasion in vitro and in vivo. In a Transwell assay, PI103
inhibited chemomigration and invasion of a variety of tumor cells
[e.g., HCT116 colon carcinoma, PC3 prostate carcinoma, MDAMB-468 breast carcinoma, and Detroit 520 squamous cell
carcinoma (Fig. 6A) and also U87MG glioblastoma (44% inhibition
at 50 nmol/L, data not shown)]. HUVEC invasion of Matrigel was
also significantly inhibited and to a greater extent than with
LY294002 at equipotent concentrations based on proliferation

Inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis were also observed in
human breast tumor xenografts. Control tumors showed extensive

vessels (Fig. 6C, top left and middle, arrows), whereas tumors
treated with 30 mg/kg PI103 twice daily remained encapsulated
and noninvasive (Fig. 6C, top right and middle). In control tumors,
there was an extensive vascular network, whereas in treated
tumors, the vessels were fewer and smaller (Fig. 6C, bottom).
Finally, we tested the effects of PI103 in a xenograft model of
late-stage ovarian carcinoma using i.p. implantation of OVCAR-3
cells. Therapy was initiated once tumors were well established and
continued for 15 days. Daily doses of 15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg, which
are well below toxic levels, reduced tumor burden (T/C, 61–62%) in
the peritoneal cavity (Supplementary Fig. S2A), and harvested
tumor cells showed decreased levels of p-AKT Ser473 at 15 min and
4 h after dosing, although in the latter case, there was evidence of
recovery of p-AKT Ser473 in one of the two samples (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). We also noted a substantial decrease in i.p. tumor spread

reduced incidences of mesenteric and lymph node metastasis in
PI103-treated animals, as assessed macroscopically and by
histologic examination (Supplementary Fig. S2C). In a separate
pharmacodynamic study, we showed inhibition of p-AKT Ser473 in
OVCAR-3 ascites and solid tumor deposits measured by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay at 30 min and 2 h following two
doses of 100 mg/kg PI103 (Supplementary Fig. S2D).

Discussion
In this study, we describe the detailed pharmacologic characterization of the pyridofuropyrimidine PI3K inhibitor PI103. We
discovered this inhibitor by elaboration of a high-throughput
screening hit (32). As also suggested in other recent reports, we find
PI103 to be a highly potent inhibitor of PI3K (31, 34). We show here
that PI103 exhibits a high degree of selectivity for class I PI3K versus a
panel of 70 protein kinases. PI103 also inhibits DNA-PK and

mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In addition, we show the
activity of PI103 in a range of tumors in vitro and in xenograft models,
together with evidence of inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis.
PI103 is especially potent against the class IA enzymes a, h, and
y, with IC50 values of 2 to 3 nmol/L. The p110g isoform is inhibited,
with an IC50 of 15 nmol/L. This profile may be important
therapeutically because all four class I enzymes have been shown
to induce oncogenic transformation (15). It is valuable to have a
potent and selective inhibitor to establish proof of concept for the
effects of inhibition of a specific molecular target in cells. We have
shown that the potency against PI3K translates well into cells, and
that PI103 is very active in U87MG glioma and PC3 prostate
carcinoma cells, both of which are PTEN null. In addition, PI103
was active both in vitro and in vivo in cells that harbor PIK3CA
mutations in both kinase and regulatory domains (A2780, Detroit
562, HCT116, IGROV-1, and SKOV3). Such mutations have been

shown to be frequent in human cancers and result in constitutive
activation of the kinase (11). Taken together, these results suggest
that PI103 is active in cells exhibiting deregulation of the PI3K
pathway by various means, and that several of the oncogenic
mutations thus far reported in PIK3CA are unlikely to confer
resistance to this inhibitor. Further work is required to investigate
in more detail the relationship between sensitivity to PI103 and
variables such as PI3K mutations/alterations and levels of p-AKT in
cancer cells. No obvious relationship is apparent from the present
results (Fig. 1A). For example, there is a wide range of sensitivity for
the cell lines with PTEN abnormalities. However, our studies in an
isogenic ovarian cancer model have indicated that a dominantnegative AKT, which shows a decrease in p-AKT Ser 473, is 2-fold
less sensitive to PI103 compared with the wild-type cell line.7

The cellular potency of PI103 is associated with a decrease in
p-AKT Ser 473 in all the human cancer cell lines studied as shown
here in the U87MG tumor by Western blot analysis and by an
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. This molecular biomarker
modulation is consistent with inhibition of the signaling pathway
downstream of PI3K and has also been reported recently by others
(35). In addition, we were able to show further potent downstream
effects on cellular localization of PDK1, AKT1, AKT2, AKT3, and
FKHR at concentrations similar to wortmannin in CHO or U20S
human osteosarcoma cells stimulated with IGF. In all cell lines
examined, treatment with PI103 resulted in a robust growth arrest
in the G1 phase of the cell cycle that was preceded by a decrease in
cyclin D1 expression. This is consistent with reports that G1 cell
cycle progression and expression of G1 cyclins are regulated by
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling (49) and was also observed in a panel of
glioma cell lines (35).
Also of particular interest was our observation that potent and
selective inhibition of class I PI3K with PI103 did not result in
apoptosis, even at several multiples of the GI50 concentrations that

clearly resulted in marked inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and
complete cytostasis. This lack of apoptosis was exemplified here
with HCT116 colon carcinoma tumor cells and was also observed
in a wide range of human cancer cell lines tested. It should be
noted that the cancer cells used were competent to undergo
apoptosis as shown following treatment with LY294002. These data
are somewhat surprising given the frequent association of the PI3K
pathway with survival signaling and apoptosis (50). However, the
expectation of apoptosis upon PI3K inhibition is based heavily on
the use of LY294002. In addition to inhibiting other members of the
PI3K superfamily and casein kinase 2 (51), it is known that
LY294002 induces cell death by producing reactive oxygen species
independent of the PI3K pathway in human prostate carcinoma
LNCaP cells (52). Interestingly, ZSTK474 was reported as a weak
inducer of apoptosis in certain cancer cell lines, an activity more
similar to LY294002 than PI103 (30).
In addition to showing potency and selectivity, together with
encouraging cytostatic properties in cancer in vitro, we wished to

show proof of principle for antitumor activity in animal models.
To do this, it was necessary to demonstrate that PI103 exhibited
suitable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties
in vivo. Although subject to high plasma clearance, PI103 was able
to achieve tumor levels above those required for in vitro tumor cell
growth inhibitory activity for 2 to 4 h with doses of 40 or 70 mg/kg
once or twice daily.
PI103 given i.p. at doses of 30 to 100 mg/kg/d showed >50%
growth inhibition in a number of human tumor xenograft models
selected for deregulation of the PI3K pathway. Significant efficacy
was achieved in the PTEN null U87MG glioma, PC3 prostate
carcinoma, and MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma; SKOV-3 ovarian
carcinoma and MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma that overexpress
ERB-B2 receptors; and also the SKOV3 ovarian and HCT116 colon
carcinoma that express a mutant PIK3CA. Fan et al. (34) observed
antitumor activity at doses of 5 mg/kg in xenografts derived from
U87MG cells transfected with constitutively activated epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR). We were unable to detect PI103 in

Pharmacology of a PI3K Inhibitor

U87MG xenografts following administration of 5 mg/kg in vivo in the
same vehicle as used by Fan et al. (50% DMSO in saline), and we
saw no down-regulation of p-AKT Ser473 by the sensitive electrochemiluminescent immunoassay at that dose (data not shown).
However, we observed 89% and 46% T/C following daily treatment of
U87MG xenografts with 40 and 70 mg/kg PI103, respectively. This
was not surprising given the plasma levels we have observed for
PI103. The results suggest that the antitumor activity observed by
Fan et al. may be due to the EGFR dependence of the modified
U87MG cells used in their study. Those authors also argued, based on
the properties of a panel of PI3K inhibitors, that combined activity
against p110a and mTOR was important for activity in glioma cell
lines. We were able to detect a decrease in AKT phosphorylation
in vivo in the U87MG glioma tumor and orthotopic OVCAR-3
ovarian carcinoma model both by Western blot and by the more
sensitive and quantitative electrochemiluminescent immunoassay.
Overall, our in vivo antitumor studies show growth inhibition rather
than regression in a range of human tumor xenografts with different
histologies and molecular pathologies, consistent with the in vitro
data that indicate a G1 cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis.
The antitumor effects were observed at well-tolerated doses,
despite the fact that the pharmacokinetic properties of PI103 are
suboptimal. This compound is relatively insoluble due to its tricyclic
core structure. In addition, it has a number of metabolic hotspots,
including the phenol ring, which we have shown is subject to
glucuronidation, and the morpholino ring, which is susceptible to
hydroxylation. These properties result in high plasma and tissue
clearance. We have previously reported similar metabolic hotspots
in LY294002 and in NU7026, a DNA-PK inhibitor (47, 48). In
particular, it seems that the morpholino ring, which has been
reported to bind to the hinge region in PI3Kg (53–55), is a highly
labile moiety and is susceptible to oxidation. Although no
significant effect was seen on circulating glucose levels with this
agent, and only very limited weight loss was observed (data not
shown), it cannot be excluded that a compound with better
pharmaceutical properties may be more toxic as well as potentially

more effective. Despite the pharmaceutical limitations of PI103, our
results show proof of principle for antitumor effects with this class
of PI3K inhibitor.
In addition to antiproliferative activity, we showed that PI103
significantly decreased tumor cell chemomigration and invasion.
This was seen in vitro in four different tumor cell types (including
those with mutant PIK3CA) and in vivo in the MDA-MB-435 breast
carcinoma and OVCAR-3 orthotopic ovarian carcinoma model that
mimics late-stage clinical disease. The results are consistent with
previous studies implicating PI3K in cell motility and invasion
(22, 56, 57). The precise isoform(s) involved are still debated and
may vary between cell types (57, 58), but PI103 inhibits three class
IA PI3K isoforms with equal potency that may contribute to its
anti-invasive effects.
Finally, we showed that activated human endothelial cells are also
sensitive to PI103, and that greater inhibition of invasion through
the Matrigel is obtained compared with LY294002 at equipotent
concentrations (based in proliferation GI50 values). In addition, we
showed that the vascularity of orthotopic MDA-MB-435 breast
carcinomas was reduced in PI103-treated mice. Thus, there is a
potential for inhibitors of this type to have antitumor activity via
effects on angiogenesis as well as through direct action on tumor cells.
In conclusion, we have identified a potent inhibitor of class I
PI3K. This compound shows potency in vitro and antitumor
activity in vivo with evidence of target modulation. PI103
represents a valuable tool for exploring the biological functions
of class I PI3K enzymes and is a lead for further optimization of
this novel class of molecular therapeutics.
