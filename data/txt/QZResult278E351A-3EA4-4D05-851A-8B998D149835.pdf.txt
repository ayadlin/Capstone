ABSTRACT
Drug resistance of cancer cells is recognized as the primary cause of failure of
chemotherapeutic treatment in most human cancers. Growing evidences support the
idea that deregulated cellular metabolism is linked to such resistance. Indeed, both
components of the glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways are involved in altered
metabolism linked to chemoresistance of several cancers. Here we investigated the
drug-induced metabolic adaptations able to confer advantages to docetaxel resistant
prostate cancer (PCa) cells. We found that docetaxel-resistant PC3 cells (PC3-DR)
acquire a pro-invasive behavior undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition
(EMT) and a decrease of both intracellular ROS and cell growth. Metabolic analyses
revealed that PC3-DR cells have a more efficient respiratory phenotype than sensitive
cells, involving utilization of glucose, glutamine and lactate by the mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Consequently, targeting mitochondrial complex
I by metformin administration, impairs proliferation and invasiveness of PC3-DR cells
without effects on parental cells. Furthermore, stromal fibroblasts, which cause a
“reverse Warburg” phenotype in PCa cells, reduce docetaxel toxicity in both sensitive
and resistant PCa cells. However, re-expression of miR-205, a microRNA strongly
down-regulated in EMT and associated to docetaxel resistance, is able to shift OXPHOS
to a Warburg metabolism, thereby resulting in an elevated docetaxel toxicity in PCa
cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that resistance to docetaxel induces a
shift from Warburg to OXPHOS, mandatory for conferring a survival advantage to
resistant cells, suggesting that impairing such metabolic reprogramming could be a
successful therapeutic approach.

often encounters several undesirable adverse effects, and
many patients display de novo or acquired resistance. To
date, several factors have been associated with docetaxel
resistance, including expression of different isoforms
of β-tubulin [3], activation of drug efflux pumps [4],

PTEN loss [5], activation of survival pathways (i.e.,
PI3K/AKT and mTOR) [6] and recently also NOTCH2/
Hedgehog signaling pathways [7]. Recent findings both
in vitro and from tumor samples support the presence
of primary resistant cells harboring EMT/stem cell–like
characteristics [8] suggesting a possible association
between such aggressive features and chemotherapy
failure. Interestingly, acquisition of metastatic
characteristics is also associated with a specific
metabolic reprogramming [9] and tumor metabolism has
received increased attention over the last decade. Only
recently the metabolic behavior has been implicated
in tumor drug resistance [10-12]. Targeting tumor
metabolism has been shown to represent an alternative
way to overcome drug resistance and there are several
approaches that have been demonstrated to be successful
in pre-clinical models [13, 14]. However, the link
between tumor metabolism and drug resistance is highly
complex and depends on various conditions including
oxygen and/or nutrient availability [15, 16] and can be
influenced by the surrounding microenvironment [17].
Indeed, in tumor microenvironment, cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) have been shown to promote
aggressiveness of PCa cells in terms of EMT induction
[18], OXPHOS metabolic shift [19, 20] and miRNAs
deregulation [21]. In this study, we report a metabolic
shift of docetaxel-resistant PCa cells from a glycolytic
phenotype towards OXPHOS due to EMT engagement.
We also demonstrate that CAFs are able to protect tumor
cells from drug toxicity. Finally, in agreement with
recent results highlighting the key role of microRNA
in tumor progression [22], we focused our attention
on miR-205 which is down-regulated in both CAF and
docetaxel induced EMT [8, 21]. We demonstrated that
overexpression of miR-205, associated with a reversion
of OXPHOS metabolism, is crucial to sensitize PC3-DR
to the drug.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that docetaxel
treatment elicits a burst of ROS produced by NADPH
oxidase [24]. Indeed, enhancement of ROS production
is associated to many chemotherapeutic agents [24-27].
Therefore, the ability of cancer cells to handle oxidative
stress is fundamental for the protection of cells against
the cytotoxic effect of anti-cancer agents and hence for
the development of chemoresistance. To gain insights on
this aspect, we evaluated the ability of PC3-DR and PC3
cells to manage ROS. As demonstrated in Figure 1A PC3DR cells have reduced ROS levels both in basal condition
and following docetaxel treatment with respect to PC3
sensitive cells. In agreement, treatment of sensitive PC3
cells with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
decreases their sensitivity to docetaxel (Figure 1B).
Recently, the activation of the pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP) has been implicated in chemoresistance of cancer
cells [28-30] through the production of NADPH required
to fuel antioxidant systems. We evaluated the expression
and activity of the key PPP rate limiting enzyme glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) as well as PPP flux by
radioactive assay in PC3-DR and in sensitive cells (Figure
1C-1E). Surprisingly, we found a reduced expression and
activity of G6PD (Figure 1C-1D) and a reduced PPP flux
in the resistant cells (Figure 1E). Moreover, PC3-DR
cells are insensitive to G6PD inhibitors, Molecular Clip
and Tweezer [31] (Figure 1F), suggesting that docetaxelresistance does not depend on PPP activation in the model
analyzed. Furthermore, NADPH levels are decreased in
PC3-DR cells (Figure 1G). These results suggest that in the
PC3 model PPP is not involved in counteracting oxidative
stress induced by the drug. Interestingly, in agreement
with a reduction of PPP flux, which is fundamental not
only for NADPH synthesis but also for ribose 5 phosphate
production to sustain nucleic acid synthesis and hence
proliferation, we observed a decrease in cell growth of
PC3-DR with respect to PC3 (Figure 1F).

RESULTS

Docetaxel resistant cells acquire a respiratory
phenotype

PC3-DR cells acquire pro-invasive abilities
and show decreased levels of ROS and
pentose phosphate pathway flux

To establish a potential correlation between
docetaxel resistance and metabolic reprogramming,
we analyzed proteins/enzymes involved in aerobic
glycolysis and OXPHOS. To understand the metabolic
adaptations of resistant cells following treatment with the
drug and in order to reproduce circumstances occurring
in vivo during treatment with the anti-cancer agent, we
performed the experiments even in the presence of an
acute treatment of docetaxel. As shown in Figure 2A
PC3 cells have higher levels of Hexokinase II (HKII) and
monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), that have been
shown to be associated with Warburg metabolism, when
compared to PC3-DR cells, independently of docetaxel
treatment, suggesting that docetaxel resistance leads to
an adaptation towards mitochondrial metabolism. Indeed,

We established the PC3-DR cell line by treating
sensitive PC3 cells with increasing doses of docetaxel up
to a final concentration of 10 nM. PC3-DR cells achieve
EMT as shown by cell morphology, EMT markers,
increased cell invasion and secretion of interleukin-6
(IL6), a marker of prostate cancer progression [23]
(Supplementary Figure 1A-1E). Furthermore, PC3-DR
cells show a decreased expression of several pro-apoptotic
markers as well as an increased clonogenic potential as
assessed by prostaspheres formation assay (Supplementary
Figure 1E-1F).

analysis of radiolabeled carbon sources fluxes shows that
docetaxel resistant cells exhibit an increased glucose and
lactate oxidation to CO2 through mitochondrial respiration
(Figure 2B-2C) accompanied by a decrease in GLUT1
expression and glucose uptake (Figure 2D-2E). To sustain
the key role of OXPHOS in supporting chemoresistance,
we demonstrated that in hypoxic conditions, where both
HKII and MCT4 expression increases, thus restoring
Warburg metabolism, PC3-DR cells become more
sensitive to docetaxel (Supplementary Figure 2). In
agreement, another prostate cell line, namely the DU-145,
exhibits a similar respiratory phenotype after acquisition
of docetaxel resistance and mesenchymal phenotype as
shown by increased levels of glucose and lactate oxidation
and a decrease in glucose uptake; in keeping DU-145DR cells show an increase in c-Myc expression (a key
regulator of mitochondrial respiration) and a decrease
in HKII levels (Supplementary Figure 3A-3C). Taken
together, these data support the existence of a shift towards
the oxidative mitochondrial metabolism to sustain the
acquisition of the docetaxel resistance phenotype.
To deep analyze the fate of pyruvate produced in
PC3-DR and PC3 cells, we administrated DASA-58,
a molecule that induces pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)
tetramerization (hence activation) and thus pyruvate
production [32]. Upon DASA-58 administration we
demonstrated that resistant and sensitive cells show
differential behavior: PC3 cells, through the conversion
of pyruvate into lactate, show a marked increase of lactate
levels in the medium, while PC3-DR cells do not change
their lactate production (Figure 2F), but increase glucosefueled oxidation through OXPHOS (Figure 2G). To better
clarify the engagement of mitochondrial respiration in
docetaxel resistant cells, we used metformin, an inhibitor
of the mitochondrial complex I activity, to test its effect
on both cell growth and invasion of these two cell types.
As shown in Figure 3A-3D in docetaxel resistant cells
metformin selectively inhibits growth, invasiveness,
MMPs secretion and Zeb1 expression. These effects
are correlated with the disruption of the mitochondrial
respiratory function, suggesting that PC3-DR cells
are likely dependent on it. Indeed, metformin causes
a change in the metabolic behaviour of cancer cells as
shown by the upregulation of HKII, MCT4 and GLUT1
expression thus shifting the metabolism towards a clear
glycolytic one and consequently impairing the features of
mitochondrial dependent cells (Figure 3E-3F). To further
support the involvement of mitochondrial respiration
in docetaxel resistant cells we used other OXPHOS
inhibitors (rotenone, antimycin and oligomycin) to assess
the sensitivity to docetaxel. As shown in Supplementary
Figure 4, OXPHOS inhibitors affect more efficiently
PC3-DR survival, confirming a strict connection between
resistance and mitochondrial respiration.
It has been shown that cancer cells are also
dependent on glutamine to maintain the TCA cycle
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[33]. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that c-Myc is
implicated in glutamine metabolism and contributes to
metabolic reprogramming essential for cancer cells to
adapt to the tumour microenvironment, being involved
also in ribosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis, glucose
metabolism as well as lipid synthesis [34]. Interestingly,
we found a strong up-regulation of c-Myc in PC3DR cells (Figure 4A). To test the dependence of PC3DR cells on glutamine, we investigated cell growth in
the presence of a single carbon source in the medium.
As shown in Figure 4B, PC3-DR cells exhibit higher
glutamine-fuelled growth, compared to parental cells.
Furthermore, inhibition of glutaminase, the key enzyme
for mitochondrial glutamine utilization, strongly affects
the invasive abilities of resistant cells (Figure 4C). In
line with these data, PC3-DR cells exhibit an increased
glutamine uptake and oxidation through OXPHOS
(Figure 4D-4E). These data are consistent with both an
increased mitochondrial metabolism and the acquisition
of glutamine dependence in docetaxel resistant cells.
Accordingly, c-Myc silencing is able to sensitize PC3-DR
cells to docetaxel as shown in Figure 4F-4G, suggesting a
strong dependence of PC3-DR cells on c-Myc axis.
Metabolic reprogramming towards OXPHOS and
the acquisition of mesenchymal traits of the PC3-DR cells
was further supported by data mining of publicly available
gene expression profile of PCa cells that display resistance
to docetaxel [35]. In such a model, a class of genes
associated with OXPHOS metabolism are upregulated in
the docetaxel resistant cell line: pyruvate dehydrogenase
(E1) α subunit gene (PDHA1), monocarboxylate
transporter 1 (MCT1), Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase
(DLD), MYC, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A); whereas,
genes found to be associated with aerobic glycolysis are
down-regulated: MCT4, HK2, TP53 Induced Glycolysis
Regulatory Phosphatase (TIGAR), when compared to
wild type PC3 cells. Additionally, this in silico analysis
confirmed the acquisition of mesenchymal traits of PC3
cells resistant to docetaxel. Indeed, vimentin, Snai2, Zeb1
and Twist2 were upregulated and Cdh1 down-regulated
in resistant cells when compared to wild type PC3.
Noteworthy, miR-205, an established regulator of EMT
engagement in PC3 cells [8, 21], was found accordingly
down-regulated (Figure 5).

Cancer associated fibroblasts induce docetaxel
resistance in PCa cells
In the context of prostate cancer progression we
demonstrated that OXPHOS induction is a common
feature of both CAF induced metabolic reprogramming
and miR-205 down-regulation [19-21] as well as drug
resistance. Thus, we investigated the role of CAF and
miR-205 modulation on chemosensitivity of PC3 cells. To
this end we first tested whether stromal fibroblasts could

affect PC3 cells chemosensitivity to docetaxel. Indeed,
stromal cells are effective in supporting the survival of
PC3-DR cells (10 nM resistant) when treated with an
increased concentration of the drug (20 nM) (Figure 6A).
Moreover, we observed that CAFs promote also the onset
of PC3 cells resistance to docetaxel treatment as shown by
co-culturing sensitive PC3 cells with CAFs in the presence
of docetaxel (Figure 6B). Therefore, we suggest that the
stromal compartment is able to counteract docetaxel
toxicity through the establishment of an oxidative
metabolic phenotype.
In our previous reports we demonstrated that miR205 is one of the most down-regulated miRNA in PCa
cells undergoing EMT and OXPHOS induction upon CAF
contact [20, 21]. In our model we observed that OXPHOS

engagement of PC3-DR cells is correlated to a downregulation of miR-205 expression with respect to PC3
cells, too (Figure 7A). Thus, we evaluated whether miR205 re-expression could change the metabolic behavior of
PCa cells. Indeed, ectopic miR-205 expression results in
increased HKII expression and GLUT1 mRNA levels, as
well as an increase in lactate production (Supplementary
Figure 5 and Figure 7B-7D), suggesting an elevated
glycolytic flux. Furthermore, an increase of glucose uptake
and a decrease of mitochondrial glucose oxidation are
observed following miR-205 overexpression in PC3-DR
cells (Figure 7E-7F).
Finally, we evaluated whether this shift towards
the glycolysis could be associated with increased
chemosensitivity of PC3-DR cells. As expected, ectopic

resistant cells to docetaxel treatment (Figure 7G).
Similar results were obtained also in DU145-DR cells
(Supplementary Figure 6).

group of Kalluri showed that the Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α)mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration in
cancer cells is functionally relevant for tumour cells
motility and metastatic dissemination [42]. Finally, in
support of our findings, Lamb et al., proposed the use of
antibiotics to target mitochondria of cancer stem cells for
multiple tumour types [43].
Few data are known about prostate cancer
metabolism but a recent study has shown that patients
bearing mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2)
overexpression have shorter relapse free survival after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy [44]. Moreover, inhibition
of MDH2 in PCa cell lines increase the chemotherapy
efficacy [44]. Our data suggest the involvement of
mitochondrial respiration in the acquisition of docetaxel
resistance as confirmed by ability of metformin to
selectively inhibit both proliferation and invasion of
resistant cells (Figure 3). Actually the inhibitory effect
of metformin is not completely able to re-sensitize
resistant cells to docetaxel, probably due to the existence
of other compensatory mechanisms. Notably, we
showed docetaxel-resistant cells as great exploiters of
glutamine. Accordingly, overexpression of c-Myc was
associated with sensitization to the anti-proliferative
effects of metformin, consistent with c-Myc involvement
in “glutamine addiction” [45]. Metformin acts directly
on the mitochondria to inhibit OXPHOS and reduce
mitochondrial ATP production, thus forcing tumor
cells to compensate by increasing glycolysis rate [46].
Docetaxel-resistant cells - that rely heavily on OXPHOS
for energy production – show a glycolytic switch and,
consequently, an energy crisis associated to the loss of
malignant phenotype, upon metformin treatment. For
this reason, metformin could be used to exploit this
metabolic weakness in resistant cells, circumventing
treatment resistance and enhancing treatment efficacy.
Accordingly, prostate cancer stem cells have been
shown to be a good target for metformin treatment [46].
In addition, the PKM2-activator DASA-58, a wellknown molecule that allows the escape from Warburg
metabolism [32], is able to potentiate glucose oxidation
to CO2 only in resistant cells, whereas sensitive cells are
induced to produce lactate (Figure 2F-2G). In line, gene
expression analysis retrieved from publicly available
microarray analysis of PC3 cells that are resistant to
docetaxel revealed an upregulation of PDHA1 mRNA
expression, suggesting the increase of pyruvate oxidation
in TCA cycle and the upregulation of PPARGC1A crucial
for enhanced OXPHOS, mitochondrial biogenesis
and oxygen consumption rate (Figure 5). Overall, it
is possible that the recovery of OXPHOS subtracts
intermediates from anabolic processes and from PPP, to
drive ATP production. Thus, ATP may be used to enhance
the activity of multi drug resistant (MDR) transporter in
order to extrude the drug.

DISCUSSION
It is well known that cancer cells are able to rewire
their metabolism and energy production networks to
support and enable rapid proliferation, for survival in
severe conditions and for increased invasion, metastasis
and chemoresistance [12, 36-38]. Our results highlight that
docetaxel resistant prostate cancer cells plastically shift
their metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS and
that metabolic adaptation is related to the commitment
of EMT, increased invasion and achievement of stemlike traits. Furthermore, the acquisition of docetaxel
resistance is associated with down-regulation of miR-205,
whose reduced expression has been previously linked to
a respiratory phenotype [20]. Moreover, our data suggest
a possible modulation of miR-205 to sensitize cells to
docetaxel administration.
Some papers highlighted that an increased
glycolytic flux accompanied by activation of the PPP is
implicated in chemoresistance of cancer cells [29, 32].
The NADPH coenzyme, produced during oxidative phase
of PPP, is crucial to provide the reducing equivalents for
redox reaction involved in protecting against ROS. Our
data demonstrate that docetaxel-resistant PCa cells do not
rely on PPP. At the same time an important physiological
adaptation consists in a decrease of their ROS content.
Indeed, resistant cells show low proliferation rate (Figure
1F) and do not need to fuel anabolic pathways from PPP
or glycolysis, so allowing OXPHOS addiction.
In this study we analyzed the metabolic adaptation
of PCa cells due to their achievement of docetaxel
resistance. We observed that PC3-DR cells shift from
Warburg metabolism toward mitochondrial respiration,
in order to acquire a metabolic advantage. This metabolic
conversion is confirmed by both down-regulation of
glycolytic markers (HKII and MCT4) and increased
utilization of radiolabeled carbon source (glucose,
lactate and glutamine) through oxidative mitochondrial
respiration (Figures 2-4). Although cancer cells are often
characterized by intense glycolysis, even in the presence
of oxygen (Warburg effect), mounting evidence underlines
the role of OXPHOS in cancer progression and metastasis.
Actually, Viale et al., demonstrated that pancreatic tumour
cells, surviving oncogene ablation and responsible for
tumour relapse, rely on OXPHOS for survival [39]. Sun
et al., showed the existence of a shift towards OXPHOS
during EMT of drug resistant lung cancer cells [40].
Acquisition of chemoresistance to temozolomide in
glioma is associated with efficient mitochondrial coupling
and reduced ROS production [41]. More recently, the

The crucial role of OXPHOS in metabolic
reprogramming induced by CAF and miR-205 downregulation [19-21] as well as in the induction of docetaxel
resistance, suggested us to investigate the role of both
stroma and miR-205 modulation in chemoresistance.
Indeed, we demonstrated that CAFs promote the onset of
PCa cells resistance to docetaxel as well as the survival
of resistant tumor cells when exposed to increased
concentration of the drug (Figure 6), thus playing a
crucial role in protecting tumor cells against docetaxel
toxicity. Accordingly, some papers show that CAFs
provide an important niche for the development of drug
resistant cancer cells, in part through paracrine signaling
interactions with cancer cells and cancer stem cells [47,
48].
Moreover, aberrant expression of several miRNAs
leads to the development of resistant prostate cells [22].
Among the others, down-regulation of miR-205 has been
already linked to poor therapeutic outcome of prostate
cancer patients [49]. Down-modulation of miR-205 results
in upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 [50] as
well as down-regulation of E-cadherin, increase of Zeb 1
and Zeb2 [23, 51]. Consistently Puhr et al., demonstrated
that miR-205 down-regulation is responsible for the
acquisition of EMT in docetaxel resistant PCa cells [8] as
well as with the acquisition of respiratory phenotype upon
CAF contact [8, 20]. The close correlation between miR205 and OXPHOS suggested us the possibility to modulate
this miRNA to hinder chemoresistance. Indeed, we have
shown that the ectopic expression of miR-205 reverts the
OXPHOS addiction of PC3-DR, closely connected with
the detoxifying ability of these cells (Figure 7). Finally, we
observed that PCa cells metabolic reprogramming elicited
by drug resistance is based on OXPHOS as mandatory
feature of cancer malignancy. Indeed, disruption of
this metabolic state by drug poisoning OXPHOS or
by overexpressing miR-205 make resistant cells more
sensitive to the docetaxel, implicating that drug resistance
could be circumvented. The evidences highlighted in this
manuscript could be relevant in a future clinical context,
providing the rationale for using OXPHOS inhibitors to
target metabolic reprogramming and counteract resistance
to docetaxel.
Overall, our findings suggest that the combination
of chemotherapy and OXPHOS inhibition may limit
docetaxel-associated drug resistance and progression
towards metastatic disease.

(BioRad). Western blot analysis was performed as
previously described [18].

Cell growth was determined by crystal violet staining.
At indicated times, cells were washed twice with PBS
and crystal violet solution (0.5 % in 20 % methanol) was
added and incubated for 15 min. The remaining crystals
were dissolved with 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 4.2).
Viability was determined by absorbance at 595 nm using
a spectrophotometric reader.

Assay of intracellular reactive oxygen species
(ROS)
To evaluate intracellular ROS content, cells were
treated for 5 min with 5 μg/ml H2DCF-DA (Sigma).
After PBS washing, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and
analyzed immediately by fluorimetric analysis at 510 nm.
Data have been normalized to total protein content.

amplifications were run on 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR
System. Data were reported as relative quantity with
respect to the calibrator sample using the 2-ΔΔCt method.

Prostasphere formation
Cells were detached using Accutase (Sigma). For
prostasphere formation, single cells were plated at 150
cells/cm2 on low attachment 100-mm plate (Corning) in
DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 and N2
(Invitrogen), 5 μg/mL insulin, 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast
growth factor, and 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor.
Cells were grown under these conditions for 21 days and
then prostaspheres were photographed as representative
images.

Gelatin zymography
Serum-free medium from confluent monolayer of
cells was collected and 20 μL were added to the sample
buffer (SDS 0.4%, 2 % glycerol, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
pH 6.8, 0.001 % bromphenol blue). The sample was
run on a 10 % SDS gel containing 0.1 % gelatin. After
electrophoresis, the gel was washed twice with 2.5 %
Triton X-100 and once with reaction buffer (50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L CaCl2).
The gel was incubated overnight at 37°C with freshly
added reaction buffer and stained with Laemli Comassie
blue solution. Areas of gelatinase activity appear as clear
bands against a dark background.

Lactate assay

In vitro boyden invasion assay

Lactate levels were determined using a lactate
assay kit (BioVision) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. All data were normalized on cell protein
content.

Invasion assay was performed with 8 × 104 cells on
8-μm-pore Transwells (Corning) coated with 50 μg/cm2
of reconstituted Matrigel for 16 h, as described in [52].
Chemotaxis was evaluated by counting the cells migrated
to the lower surface of the filters (six randomly chosen
fields).

radioactive substrates, cells were incubated with 0.2 μCi/
mL or 0.5μ Ci/mL [U-14C] lactate or [U-14C]-glucose and
glutamine for 15 min into 35 mm-dish. Each dish had a
taped piece of Whatman paper facing the inside of the
dish wetted with 100 μL of phenyl-ethylamine-methanol
(1:1) to trap the CO2. Then 200 μL of 4M H2SO4 was
added to cells. Finally, Whatman paper was removed
and transferred to scintillation vials for counting. C)
PPP activity was evaluated by using [1-14C]-glucose and
[6-14C]-glucose. 14CO2 developed from [1-14C]-glucose
oxidation originates by the PPP or by the TCA cycle,
whereas 14CO2 released from [6-14C]-glucose originates
only by TCA cycle. 2 μCi [1-14C]-glucose or 2 μCi [6-14C]glucose were added for 1 h to cells, in two different plates
of same sample. Then, CO2 released was measured as
above. The extent of PPP metabolic flux was obtained by
subtracting the amount of CO2 developed from [6-14C]glucose from the CO2 released from [1-14C]-glucose.
