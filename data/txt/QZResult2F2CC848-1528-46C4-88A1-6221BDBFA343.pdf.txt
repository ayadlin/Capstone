Abstract
The increasing evidence that ;D T cells have potent antitumor
activity suggests their value in immunotherapy, particularly in
areas of unmet need such as metastatic carcinoma. To this end,
we initiated a phase I clinical trial in metastatic hormonerefractory prostate cancer to examine the feasibility and
consequences of using the ;D T-cell agonist zoledronate, either
alone or in combination with low-dose interleukin 2 (IL-2), to
activate peripheral blood ;D cells. Nine patients were enlisted to
each arm. Neither treatment showed appreciable toxicity. Most
patients were treated with zoledronate + IL-2, but conversely
only two treated with zoledronate displayed a significant longterm shift of peripheral ;D cells toward an activated effectormemory–like state (TEM), producing IFN-; and perforin. These
patients also maintained serum levels of tumor necrosis factor–
related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), consistent with a
parallel microarray analysis showing that TRAIL is produced by
;D cells activated via the T-cell receptor and IL-2. Moreover, the
numbers of TEM ;D cells showed a statistically significant
correlation with declining prostate-specific antigen levels and
objective clinical outcomes that comprised three instances of
partial remission and five of stable disease. By contrast, most
patients treated only with zoledronate failed to sustain either
;D cell numbers or serum TRAIL, and showed progressive
clinical deterioration. Thus, zoledronate + IL-2 represents a
novel, safe, and feasible approach to induce immunologic and
clinical responses in patients with metastatic carcinomas,
potentially providing a substantially increased window for
specific approaches to be administered. Moreover, ;D cell
phenotypes and possibly serum TRAIL may constitute novel
biomarkers of prognosis upon therapy with zoledronate + IL-2
in metastatic carcinoma. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7450–7]

prostatectomized patients with localized prostate cancer, up to one
third such individuals experience disease recurrence (2, 3). In a
median of 8 years after relapse, these patients will suffer from
metastatic disease leading to death within another 2 to 5 years,
independently of the applied treatment regimen (4). Advanced,
recurrent, and metastatic tumors treated by androgen deprivation
convert to androgen-independent growth within a few years and
patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer
(HRPC) have a median survival of only 16 months. Treatment
options are limited to aggressive chemotherapy with survival
benefits of 2 to 3 months (5, 6). This lack of effective therapies for
HRPC has fueled an intensive search for novel modalities, including
immunotherapy (5–8).
There is good evidence that tumors can naturally be controlled by
the immune system (9), and most immunotherapy strategies aim to
induce adaptive, tumor-specific responses of B cells and MHCrestricted ah T cells, particularly CD8 T cells. Nonetheless, despite
major advances in this area, and the introduction of vaccine-based
strategies, durable responses are rare and active immunotherapy is
not yet an established modality. Tumor immunoevasion mechanisms are common and include the down-regulation of tumorassociated antigens, of MHC, and of costimulatory molecules (9, 10).
By contrast to ah T cells, gy T cells are not MHC restricted and
show less dependence on costimulators such as CD28. Moreover, gy
T cells are a natural component of resistance to cutaneous
carcinogenesis in mice (11), and in humans display potent MHCunrestricted cytotoxic activity in vitro against various tumors,
including prostate cancer cell lines (12, 13). Indeed, human Vg9Vy2
T cells expanded ex vivo and then adoptively transferred to severe
combined immunodeficient mice xenografted with tumor cells
showed efficacy against B-cell lymphoma; melanoma; and renal,
pancreatic, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (14). Building on this,
the potential of human gy T cells for tumor immunotherapy has
been directly analyzed and was recently expertly reviewed (15, 16).
Among gy T cells, human peripheral blood Vg9Vy2 T cells
recognize low molecular mass nonpeptide ligands (17–20). Such
‘‘phosphoantigens’’ comprise isoprenoid pathway metabolites, as
(E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl PPi (HMB-PP) derived from
bacteria and protozoa (19) and isopentenyl PPi (IPP) derived from
host cells (20). Accordingly, pharmacologic agents, such as
aminobisphosphonates, that cause an accumulation of such
metabolites (21), sensitize tumor cells to Vg9Vy2 T cells.
Recognition may then be sustained by the tumor cell expression
of NKG2D ligands, such as MICA and MICB, and of an ATPase that
binds the Vg9Vy2 T-cell receptor (TCR; ref. 22), and that unlike in
normal cells is ectopically expressed on the tumor cell surface.

Vg9Vd2 T Cells for Immunotherapy of Prostate Cancer

Like other T cells, Vg9Vy2 lymphocytes comprise distinct
populations distinguishable on the basis of surface markers, effector
functions, and trafficking properties. Naive (Tnaive,CD45RA+CD27+)
and central memory (TCM, CD45RACD27+) cells home to secondary lymphoid organs and lack immediate effector functions,
whereas the so-called effector-memory (TEM, CD45RACD27)
and terminally differentiated (TEMRA, CD45RA+CD27) cells home
to sites of inflammation where they display immediate effector
functions such as cytokine production and cytotoxicity (23). Such
functions are attractive weapons for immunotherapy strategies, and
there are promising results from recent, relatively small-scale
applications of Vg9Vy2 T cells to hematologic (24) and solid-tissue
malignancies, including prostate cancer (25) and advanced renal cell
carcinoma (26). Assessing that aminobisphosphonates such as
zoledronate are already widely used in the clinic, we have
conducted a phase I clinical trial in metastatic HRPC to determine
the safety, feasibility, and response induced by activating Vg9Vy2
T cells in vivo using zoledronate either alone or in combination
with low-dose IL-2. Although there has been a promising application of pamidronate and IL-2 to prescreened multiple myeloma
and non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients (24), there has been only
one reported, small-scale application of zoledronate to solid tumors
(25), and the consequences of a selective activation of gy T cells

in vivo were unknown before the current study. In this regard, data
presented here support the proposal that zoledronate + IL-2 may
prove a novel, safe, feasible, and efficacious means to extend the life
span of those with late stage metastatic carcinoma, and thereby to
increase the window of the patients’ availability for other, more
tumor-specific molecular approaches.

Materials and Methods
Study design. Treatment of patients according to an institutional review
board–approved protocol was done following written informed consent
from each subject or subject’s guardian. The study was designed only for
metastatic HRPC, and 18 patients [age range 61–78 years (median 68 years)]
pretreated with androgen deprivation and radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy were enrolled. Only patients with an expected life span of f3 months,
with the presence of bone metastasis and a Kernovsky index >60%,
were included. All patients had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase
of z20% within 2 months. The median pretreatment PSA doubling
time, calculated as described in ref. (27) was 4.1 months (range 4.3–
3.9 months, respectively), and the median time to progression was
10.6 months (95% CI, 7.8–13.2 months). No statistically significant difference
in either PSA doubling time or time to progression was found between
patients enrolled to receive zoledronate and zoledronate + IL-2. With
the exception of patients 1B and 2B, all other patients received docetaxel

36 mg/m2 i.v. over 15 to 30 min weekly for 6 consecutive weeks, on an
8-week cycle. All the patients had received four to five cycles docetaxel
before being enrolled in this study. Patients were excluded if they were
receiving any chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or bisphosphonates over a
period 6 weeks before study entry; if they had severe cardiovascular disease,
refractory hypertension, symptomatic coronary artery disease; a serum
creatinine of >3.0 mg/dL or a corrected ( for albumin) serum calcium of
<8.0 mg/dL; if they had CNS metastases; a history of autoimmunity, with
serious intercurrent chronic or acute illnesses or concurrent second malignancy; or if they were being treated with steroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Treatment with antiandrogen was withdrawn at least
4 weeks before study entry, whereas continuation of gonadal androgen
suppression was conducted on all patients on luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone analogues. The main characteristics of the patients are
shown in Supplementary Table S1. The clinical status of patients was
evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (28).
Treatment schedule. Eighteen subjects with metastatic HRPC were
enrolled and randomized to receive either zoledronate (cohort A) or
zoledronate + IL-2 (cohort B). Zoledronate (Novartis) was administered by a
15 min 100 mL i.v. infusion of normal saline at a standard dose of 4 mg,
every 21 days. IL-2 (Chiron, 0.6  106 IU) was administered s.c. immediately
after each zoledronate administration. All patients received 500 mg calcium
supplement and 400 IU of vitamin D daily. This treatment schedule was
done for 1 year.
Flow cytometry. Patients’ blood samples were collected before (month 0)
and at 3 months (6 days after the fourth administration of zoledronate or
zoledronate/IL-2), 9 months (6 days after the 13th administration of
zoledronate or zoledronate/IL-2), and 12 months (6 days after the 17th
administration of zoledronate or zoledronate/IL-2) after the study began.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained by FicollHypaque centrifugation and stained with FITC-, phycoerythrin-, phycoerythrin-Cy5–, or allophycocyanin-conjugated antibodies against CD27,
CD45RA, CD69, HLA-DR, CD3, CD56, CD4, CD8, TCR pan ah, TCR pan

software (Becton Dickinson). The lymphocytes were gated for forward/
side scatter.
Analysis of V;9VD2 T cells. The medium used throughout was complete
RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
human pooled AB serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 20 nmol/L HEPES, and
100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin. PBMC were labeled with CFSE
(Molecular Probes) and cultured at 37jC, in 5% CO2, at 106/mL in 96-well
flat-bottomed plates (0.2 mL/well), with isopentenyl PPi (IPP, Sigma
Chemical Co.; 105 mol/L final concentration) and 20 units/mL IL-2
(23, 25). Seven days later, cells were collected and the percentage of Vg9Vy2
cells within the CD3+ population was assessed by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS). The absolute number of Vg9Vy2 T cells present in
each culture was calculated according to the following formula: % Vg9Vy2
T cells  total number of viable cells/100. The Vg9Vy2 T-cell expansion
factor was then calculated by dividing the absolute number of Vg9Vy2 T
cells in stimulated cultures by the number of Vg9Vy2 T cells cultured in the
absence of IPP (23). IFNg levels in the 48 h culture supernatants were
assessed by two mAbs sandwich ELISA (23) following manufacturer’s
recommendations (R&D Systems). Na-CBZ-L-lysine-thiobenzyl (BLT)esterase levels in 24 h culture supernatants were determined by the BLT
esterase assay. Briefly, 20 AL culture supernatant were incubated with 35 AL
1 mmol/L BLT (Sigma), 35 AL 1 mmol/L 5-5¶-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid;
Sigma), and 10 AL 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). After incubation for 30 min
at 37jC, absorbance was measured at 405 nm (23).
Intracellular staining for IFN-; and perforin. PBMC stimulated with
IPP as described above, in the presence of monensin for 6 h at 37jC in 5%
CO2 were harvested, washed, and stained with anti-Vy2 mAb in incubation
buffer (PBS containing 1% FCS and 0.1% Na azide) for 30 min at 4jC. Cells
were then washed twice in PBS with 1% FCS and fixed with PBS containing
4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4jC. Fixation was followed by
permeabilization with PBS containing 1% FCS, 0.3% saponin, and 0.1% Na
azide for 15 min at 4jC, and fixed permeabilized cells were stained with an
anti–IFN-g antibody. After two more washes in PBS containing 1% FCS, the
cells were analyzed by FACSCalibur. Lymphocytes were gated by forward
and side scatter and analysis done on 100,000 acquired events for each
sample. For detection of intracellular perforin, PBMC were stained directly

ex vivo (i.e., without any antigen stimulation in vitro) in calcium-free
medium with anti-Vy2 mAb as above described, washed, and fixed with PBS
containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4jC. After two washes in
permeabilization buffer, cells were stained with antiperforin antibody (yG2,
Alexis; 2 Ag/mL); after two more washes in PBS + 1% FCS, the cells were
analyzed as above.
Analysis of tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis inducing ligand
expression. PBMC from healthy volunteers were stimulated in vitro for 3
days with zoledronate at the indicated concentrations, with or without IL-2
(100 units/mL). Brefeldin A (Sigma) was added to the cultures at 10 Ag/mL 3
h before harvest, and surface-stained cells (CD3-ECD and Vg9-PE-Cy5,
Beckman Coulter) were then labeled using the Fix & Perm kit (Caltag) with
anti-TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis inducing ligand)phycoerythrin (BD Biosciences). TRAIL in sera was detected using a human
TRAIL DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems).
Statistical analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess the effect
of treatments on 12-month survival; a sample size calculation of 18 patients
(nine per group) assured a power of 85% in detecting a 3-month difference
in survival curves among groups, with a SD of F3 and a two-sided a error
of 5. The significance of the differences in survival was assessed using the
log-rank, Breslow (Generalized Wilcoxon), or Tarone-Ware tests. Data from
more than two groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with TukeyKramer multiple comparison test using Instat software (version 3.05,
GraphPad). P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Rationale. Human Vg9Vy2 T cells can be activated in a nonMHC–dependent manner by phosphoantigens or by agents that
provoke the accumulation of endogenous PPi such as IPP. Among
such agents, aminobisphosphonates are already widely used in the
clinic, for example, to diminish osteoclast activity in osteoporosis
or in elderly patients receiving chronic steroid treatment. By
several criteria, zoledronate is the most potent and efficacious
clinically approved aminobisphosphonate (29, 30). Our ongoing
molecular analyses of Vg9Vy2 T-cell responses have indicated that
IL-2 up-regulates several effector molecules that may be efficacious
in tumor therapy, and is active in vivo on Vg9Vy2 T cells at a lower
concentration than that required to affect ah T cells or natural
killer (NK) cells. For these reasons, we rationalized that zoledronate
F low-dose IL-2 may provide a feasible and safe means to activate
Vg9Vy2 T cells in vivo.
Toxicity. One to 3 days after the first administration, six of nine
patients treated with zoledronate + IL-2 (67%) and two of nine
patients treated with zoledronate alone (22%) developed a
transient flu-like syndrome that was easily controlled by oral
paracetamol. This side effects was expected as it was also detected

after application of pamidronate and IL-2 to multiple myeloma and
non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients (24). Two patients (22%)
receiving zoledronate + IL-2 developed a local erythema at the
site of IL-2 administration. No other hematologic, hepatic, renal, or
neurologic toxicity, or allergic, autoimmune, or fatigue side effect
was observed during the treatment.
;D T-cell responses. Phenotypic and functional responses of gy
T cells were measured before and at 3, 9, and 12 months after
beginning treatment with zoledronate F IL-2 (Fig. 1A and B). By
multiple criteria, the surviving patients in the two treatment
protocols showed substantially different effects on gy cells. Before
treatment, almost all patients displayed f25  103 to 45  103 gy
cells per milliliter of blood. As four patients treated with
zoledronate alone (cohort A) died before month 3, longitudinal
analysis was possible in only five such patients (1A, 2A, 3A, 7A, and
8A). Of these, only patient 7A sustained starting levels of gy cells
across the treatment period. Although patient 1A showed a
transient increase in gy cell numbers at 3 months, the cells then
declined to below starting levels.
In stark contrast, seven patients treated with zoledronate + IL-2
(cohort B) survived past month 12, of whom five (1B, 2B, 3B, 4B,
and 8B) showed sustained or increased numbers of peripheral gy T
cells across the full period. One surviving patient (9B) showed a
decrease in peripheral gy T cells, up to 9 months, although those
numbers then stabilized, whereas another (6B) showed a more
substantial ongoing decline. Both of the two cohort B patients who
died (5B and 7B) displayed precipitous and progressive decreases
in peripheral blood gy T-cell numbers. In addition to the different
frequencies of peripheral blood gy cells in the two cohorts, there
was a more pronounced increase in CD69 (Fig. 1C) and/or HLA-DR
(Fig. 1D) antigens on gy T cells in cohort B, indicating greater
activation in vivo. The stimulatory effects of zoledronate F IL-2
treatment were largely restricted to gy T cells, because neither
absolute numbers nor CD69 and HLA-DR expression were altered
on ah T cells or NK cells (Supplementary Table S2).
When a subset analysis was done on gy T cells in the seven
cohort B patients surviving through month 12, there were in all
cases sharp and progressive decreases in absolute numbers of cells
with naı̈ve-like and central memory–like phenotypes (Tnaive and
TCM gy T cells), and, correspondingly, albeit more variable
increases in cells with effector memory–like and terminally
differentiated phenotypes (TEM and TEMRA gy cells), although the
TEMRA gy cells declined somewhat by 12 months (Fig. 2). The
pattern of increased numbers and an altered phenotype of
peripheral gy cells was strikingly depicted by the raw data for

Figure 3. Proliferation, IFN-g production, and
cytotoxic activity of gy T cells in patients treated with
zoledronate + IL-2. PBMC were obtained from
seven patients treated with zoledronate + IL-2,
before starting treatment (month 0), and 3, 9, and
12 mo after treatment. Cells were cultured in vitro
with IPP and IL-2, as described in Materials and
Methods. Proliferation was evaluated 7 d later,
whereas IFN-g production and BLT-esterase
activities were assessed in the 48 and 24 h
supernatants, respectively. O.D., absorbance.

patient 1B shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Overall, the statistically
significant changes indicate that zoledronate + IL-2 provokes a
long-term effector maturation and mobilization of peripheral
blood gy T cells and evoke our previous observations after
zoledronate injection in cancer patients (25). Indeed, a similar
trend was seen in the three patients treated with zoledronate alone
surviving more than 12 months (data not shown), although the
absolute numbers of peripheral gy T cells declined in all but one of
these patients (7A).
The phenotypic modifications of gy T cells in cohort B were
paralleled by modifications in functional responses in vitro. As
shown in Fig. 3, proliferative responses to IPP declined over time,
whereas the capacity to produce IFN-g and to release BLT-esterase
(as a variable of cytotoxicity) consistently increased, peaking at 9
months. Again, this trend is illustrated by raw data for patient 1B
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
Clinical responses and clinical correlates. Only two of nine
patients treated with zoledronate alone showed any clinical
response (Supplementary Table S1, Fig. 1A). In one patient (1A),
stable disease was observed over 14 months, whereas patient 7A,
who was the only patient in cohort A to sustain pretreatment levels
of gy T cells, achieved a partial remission. In contrast, six of nine
patients treated with zoledronate + IL-2 showed favorable clinical
responses (Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 1B). Two patients (1B and
8B) achieved a partial remission, and each showed aggregate
increases in gy T-cell numbers across the treatment period. Four
additional patients (2B, 3B, 4B, and 9B) achieved stable disease,
lasting 14 to 16 months, and with a sole exception (9B) each
showed sustained gy T-cell numbers; indeed, even in 9B, gy T-cell
numbers had stabilized by 9 to 12 months at f10  103 gy T cells
per milliliter of blood. By contrast, the deterioration of patients 5B,
6B, and 7B was in each case preceded by a substantial decline in gy
T-cell numbers (Fig. 1A and B). The 12-month survival curves of
patients treated with zoledronate alone and those treated with
zoledronate + IL-2 is shown in Fig. 4A. Figure 4B shows echo-color
Doppler imaging of the prostate of patient 1B before (top) and 12
months (bottom) after zoledronate + IL-2 therapy, showing
regression of prostate malignancy.
The prima facie correlation between 12-month clinical outcome
(i.e., partial remission versus stable disease versus progression)
and, respectively, increases in, maintenance of, or decreases in
circulating gy T-cell numbers was provocative and was investigated
further. A statistically significant correlation existed between
favorable outcome at 12 months, and either total gy cell numbers
or the numbers of TCR gy TEM cells measured at 9 months (Fig. 5A
and B). Moreover, a statistically significant inverse correlation was
also found between either total gy T cells or TCR gy TEM cells and
serum PSA levels at 9 months (Fig. 5C and D). Of note, we did not
find any correlation between pretreatment PSA levels and total gy
cells (r = 0.0033, P = 0.99) or their TEM subset (r = 0.088, P = 0.81).
To illustrate this point further, Supplementary Fig. S3A and B
shows a longitudinal analysis of total gy cells, the gy TEM subset,
and serum PSA levels in a patient (1B) achieving an objective
immune response (partial remission), and in a patient (6B)
showing disease progression.
The highly distinct clinical outcomes in the two cohorts
prompted us to examine further the differences that might exist
between them. Related to this, a set of microarray analyses was
undertaken while the trial was ongoing, of human peripheral blood
gy cells stimulated with a phosphoantigen TCR agonist (HMB-PP)
in the presence of different cytokines, including IL-2 (31). The study

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

confirmed that IFN-g and tumor necrosis factor-a are up-regulated
in such circumstances, but additionally found that the cytolytic
mediator, TRAIL, was specifically up-regulated in the presence of
IL-2. We therefore tested whether TRAIL was likewise up-regulated
in vitro by zoledronate + IL-2, more than by zoledronate alone, and
confirmed that it was, identifying a provocative potential difference
between the two cohorts (Fig. 6A). Although these findings
postdated the analysis of patients’ gy T cells, an a posteriori
examination of patients’ serum showed that TRAIL levels were
essentially maintained in cohort B, whereas they mostly declined in
cohort A (Fig. 6B). Of note, the single outlier in cohort A (7A)
whose TRAIL levels had recovered close to their pretreatment

zoledronate alone who maintained gy T-cell numbers and who
showed a partial remission. When serum TRAIL levels at 9 months
were examined for all 11 patients surviving at 12 months, there was
a clear trend whereby higher TRAIL levels were associated with

improved clinical outcome (Fig. 6C); in fact, there was only a single
overt outlier (6B) who was treated with zoledronate + IL-2 and who
maintained TRAIL levels, but whose disease progressed. This
patient prevented the correlation between TRAIL levels and
outcome reaching statistical significance. Nonetheless, the likely

biological significance of the correlation between clinical outcome
and serum TRAIL concentrations at 9 months was highlighted by
the lack of an obvious correlation with other variables, including
pretreatment TRAIL levels (Supplementary Fig. S4), and 9-month
levels of other immunologic mediators (data not shown).

Discussion
Several observations in mice and in humans have collectively
laid the foundation for examining the potential of gy T cells to
exert tumor immunotherapy. A practical issue has been how to
accomplish this. In this regard, an attractive feature of human
peripheral blood Vg9Vy2 T cells is their capacity to be readily and
specifically activated either by low molecular mass phosphoantigens, such as HMB-PP or IPP, or by agents that provoke IPP
accumulation. Among the latter, aminobisphosphonates are well
established in the clinic, and extensive data are available on the
antiangiogenic, antiosteolytic, and proapoptotic properties of the
compounds (29, 30).
In patients with multiple myeloma or with low-grade non–
Hodgkin lymphoma, occurrences of acute-phase reaction to i.v.
pamidronate were attributed to the systemic activation of
phosphoantigen-reactive gy T cells (24), and this provoked the
deliberate treatment of lymphoma patients with pamidronate and
low-dose IL-2. This achieved some promising results after patients
were prescreened for those whose gy T cells would substantively
respond to pamidronate + IL-2 in vitro (24). By several criteria,
zoledronate is more potent and efficacious than pamidronate, and
previous studies by our own group in patients with breast (n = 3)
and prostate (n = 6) tumors showed that zoledronate induced
in vivo the maturation of peripheral blood gy T cells into more
potent cytotoxic and IFN-g–secreting cells (25). This notwithstanding, there has hitherto been no study of the consequences of a
selective activation of gy T cells in vivo in patients with late-stage,
metastatic carcinomas, a significant unmet clinical need. Moreover,
there has been no assessment of the consequences of administering zoledronate in vivo in the presence or absence of a specific
cytokine, such as IL-2. This is important given the evidence that the
differentiation of gy cells, like other T cells, is substantially
influenced by the prevailing cytokine milieu (31–34). Given such
paucity of existing data, the assessment of toxicity was a major aim
of the current study. Our findings reveal that the combination of
zoledronate + IL-2 was well tolerated, with no long-term overt
toxicity observed. Consistent with a lack of significant side effects,
neither zoledronate nor IL-2 used at the low doses described in this
study had any measurable effects on either ah T cells or NK cells
(Supplementary Table S2).
A second aim of our study was to assess whether reproducible
phenotypic changes were induced in the gy T-cell compartment. In
this regard, the most striking effect was the long-term and
substantial differentiation of gy T cells toward an effectormemory–like phenotype, with absolute numbers of such cells
particularly enhanced in patients treated with zoledronate + IL-2;
indeed, absolute numbers of peripheral Tnaive and TCM gy cells
decreased by 3 months after treatment and had virtually
disappeared at 9 to 12 months. This was seen in the majority of
zoledronate + IL-2–treated patients without any prescreening for
those whose cells would respond to this regimen in vitro. Based on
variable gy T-cell repertoires and on the preexisting status of such
cells, it is known that peripheral blood responses to phosphoantigens or aminobisphosphonates show individual variation, and by

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

analogy to earlier studies in lymphoma (24), one can only assume
that such prior screening may well improve the response rate to
zoledronate + IL-2. A similar trend was seen in three of nine
patients receiving zoledronate alone, although they were, with one
exception (7A), less impressive, and may have been sustained by
individually variable levels of endogenous cytokines.
A third and final aim of our study was to assess whether there
was a differential clinical response to the treatment regimens.
Indeed, whereas only two of nine patients treated with zoledronate
achieved an objective tumor response, this was true for 67% of
those treated with zoledronate + IL-2, where the response at 12
months showed a correlation with the absolute numbers of total gy
T cells; with the numbers of gy TEM cells; and although not
significantly, with serum levels of TRAIL measured at 9 months
posttreatment. Moreover, the fact that clinical outcome was
influenced by the type of regimen used to activate gy T cells
strongly suggests that gy T-cell activation is at least partially causal
to the response. Thus, gy T cells stimulated in vitro with
zoledronate and IL-2 possess an increased capacity for killing
tumor cells in vitro (30),6 whereas our immunologic monitoring
provided no evidence that zoledronate F low-dose IL-2 induced
activation, expansion, and/or differentiation of either ah T cells or
NK cells (note that the concentration of IL-2 used here is much
lower than that used in other immunotherapies; refs. 35–37).
Interestingly, it was recently reported that the presence of TEM cells
within colorectal cancer correlates with the absence of pathologic
evidence of early metastases and with prolonged survival (38).
However, despite the provided in vitro evidence that stimulation
with zoledronate + IL-2 increases the production of TRAIL by gy
cells in short-term cultures, we have actually no proof that gy cells
solely contribute to sustained serum TRAIL levels in patients
treated with zoledronate + IL-2. The finding that neither absolute
numbers nor CD69 and HLA-DR expression were altered on ah T
cells or NK cells (Supplementary Table 2) strongly points to a
selective effects on gy cells. The fact that patients enrolled in this
study were at a terminal stage of disease might also contribute to
the lack of increase in serum TRAIL levels.
We have yet to elucidate the key contributions to tumor
regulation made by gy TEM cells induced by zoledronate + IL-2.
Nonetheless, clues should exist in the ongoing microarray analysis
of Vg9Vy2 cells stimulated via the TCR in the presence of IL-2. This
study has already provoked our analysis of TRAIL as a potential
active component, and, guided by this, future studies will look
directly at TRAIL production by gy T cells in an immunotherapy
context. For several reasons, TRAIL is an attractive candidate: For
example, it kills many tumor cell lines but not most nontransformed cells, and the selective efficacy of histone deacetylase
inhibitors versus acute myeloid leukemia cells involves TRAIL
induction in vivo (39, 40). Nonetheless, there is a view that the
results using agonistic anti–TRAIL receptor antibody as an
antitumor agent have been disappointing, perhaps because of
resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, which is common in
cancer cells (41). Interestingly, resistance can be overcome by IFN-g
(42), which is produced in high amounts by zoledronate + IL-2–
stimulated Vg9Vy2 T cells, and which is positively reinforced by
signaling via TRAIL, and vice versa (43, 44). Thus, it is the
maintenance of TRAIL production in the context of other products

of Vg9Vy2 TEM cells that may be key, consistent with which clinical
outcome did not correlate with pretreatment levels of TRAIL. This
emphasizes a major potential advantage of cell-based therapy.
Indeed, the combination of an agonistic anti–TRAIL receptor
antibody and the induction of IFN-g–producing T cells was shown
to eradicate established tumors in mice (45).
The encouraging prospect that the activation of peripheral blood
Vg9Vy2 T cells can be efficacious against solid tumors requires
further follow-up, including an analysis of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes to assess whether the activated cells are indeed
infiltrating the tumors and/or are helping other cells to do so. Wang
and colleagues recently reported that human prostate and breast
carcinoma are naturally and strongly infiltrated by TRAIL-producing
gy T cells,7 suggesting the value of analyzing the regulation on

that in the short-term, the peripheral blood analysis of the status of

antitumor response upon therapy with zoledronate + IL-2.
