Abstract
Aberrant forms of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
multiple human cancers, where ALK represents a rational therapeutic target in these settings. In this study, we
report the identification and biological characterization of X-376 and X-396, two potent and highly specific ALK
small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In Ambit kinome screens, cell growth inhibition studies, and
surrogate kinase assays, X-376 and X-396 were more potent inhibitors of ALK but less potent inhibitors of MET
compared to PF-02341066 (PF-1066), an ALK/MET dual TKI currently in clinical trials. Both X-376 and X-396
displayed potent antitumor activity in vivo with favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles. Similar levels of
drug sensitivity were displayed by the three most common ALK fusion proteins in lung cancer (EML4-ALK
variants E13;A20, E20;A20, and E6b;A20) as well as a KIF5B–ALK fusion protein. Moreover, X-396 could potently
inhibit ALK kinases engineered with two point mutations associated with acquired resistance to PF-1066,
L1196M, and C1156Y, when engineered into an E13;A20 fusion variant. Finally, X-396 displayed synergistic
growth inhibitory activity when combined with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Our findings offer preclinical
proof-of-concept for use of these novel agents to improve therapeutic outcomes of patients with mutant ALKdriven malignancies. Cancer Res; 71(14); 4920–31. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is aberrant in a variety of malignancies. ALK
was originally discovered in anaplastic large cell lymphoma
(ALCL) as part of a chromosomal translocation t(2,5), which
fuses the C-terminal kinase domain of ALK encoded on
chromosome 2p23 to the N-terminus of nucleophosmin
(NPM) on chromosome 5q35 (1). Subsequently, a variety of
ALK fusion proteins have been found in multiple malignancies, including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT; ref.
2) and non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; refs. 3–10). All ALK
fusions tested biologically to date have showed gain of function properties (1, 3, 4, 7). Activating mutations in wild-type
ALK have also been identified in both familial and sporadic

neuroblastoma. Most of these activating mutations occur
within the tyrosine kinase domain and are transforming in
vitro and in vivo (11–14).
Importantly, the activity of cancer-specific ALK variants is
required for tumor maintenance. Thus, ALK mutants can
serve as "Achilles heels" to be exploited therapeutically. Multiple preclinical studies have shown that specific small molecule
ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can delay tumor growth
and/or induce tumor regression in xenograft and transgenic
models (3–5, 15–19).
Based on such promising preclinical studies, ALK inhibitors
have recently entered into clinical trials. The first agent in
humans is PF-02341066 (crizotinib, Pfizer; hereafter referred
to as "PF-1066"), an orally available small molecule ATPmimetic compound. PF-1066 was originally designed as a
MET inhibitor but was recognized to have "off-target" antiALK activity (17). Strikingly, in a Phase I study, patients with
ALK fusion positive NSCLC showed a 57% radiographic
response rate (20). By contrast, chemotherapy response rates
are <10% in previously treated patients with unselected
NSCLC (21). A Phase III trial randomizing patients to crizotinib (PF-1066) versus standard chemotherapy after disease
progression on first-line treatment is now ongoing for patients
with ALK fusion positive NSCLC.
Here, we report identification of X-376 and X-396, novel,
more potent and specific ALK TKIs with potential therapeutic
relevance. We compare the effectiveness of these "secondgeneration" TKIs versus PF-1066 both in vitro and in vivo. We
show the antitumor activity of these compounds against
multiple ALK variants found in NSCLC, including 2 point

mutations in the ALK tyrosine kinase domain which have been
associated with acquired resistance to PF-1066. Finally, we
show that these ALK TKIs display synergistic antitumor
activity when combined with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin.

Materials and Methods
Compounds
X-376 and X-396 were synthesized according to procedures
published in WO 2009/154769 and dissolved in DMSO. PF1066 (ChemieTek) and TAE-684 (Selleck Chemicals) were
dissolved in DMSO. Rapamycin (Catalog No. 9904, Cell Signaling) was dissolved in methanol. Ambit KINOMEscans (Ambit
Biosciences) were performed for each ALK TKI against 96
distinct kinase targets using methods previously described
(22, 23). Compounds (PF-1066, X-376, X-396) were formulated
in 0.5% HPMC, 0.4% Tween80, 99.1% DI water for all in vivo
studies (PK, efficacy, toxicity).
Computational modeling
A model of X-376 in ALK was generated using the DS
ViewerPro 5.0 program from Accelrys Inc. The X-ray crystal
structure of PF-1066 in the MET kinase domain (PDB code:
2WGJ) was used as a starting point.
Cell culture
All cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator
with 5% CO2 at 37 C. The human lung adenocarcinoma cell
lines H3122, H2228, PC-9, H2030, and HCC78 have been
described previously (5, 24–26) and were verified to harbor
their reported genetic alterations by direct sequencing of DNA
or cDNA. The human anaplastic lymphoma cell line was a
generous gift from Dr. S. Morris of St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital (1). The human gastric carcinoma cell line, MKN-45,
and the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2,
have been described previously (27, 28). These cell lines were
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and penicillin-streptomycin (Mediatech, Inc.) to final concentrations 100 U/mL
and 100 mg/mL, respectively. The human neuroblastoma cell
line SH-SY5Y (ATCC) was grown in a 1:1 mixture of EMEM
and F12 (both from Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with
10% FBS and pen-strep. The human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (ATCC) was grown in EMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and pen-strep. 293 cells (ATCC) were
cultivated in DMEM (Mediatech) supplemented with 10%
FBS. 293 cells were transfected with various ALK cDNAs using
Superfect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Ba/F3 cell line generation
EML4-ALK E13;A20 was cloned from pMA-3FLAG-EML4ALK E13;A20 into the retroviral pBabe-puro backbone. The
L1196M and C1156Y mutations were introduced into the
cDNA encoding the E13;A20 variant using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) with mutant-specific primers according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Ba/F3 cell lines were
established as described previously using purified IL-3 at 10

ng/mL and puromycin at 1.5 mg/mL (29). Transgene expression was assessed by Sanger sequencing and immunoblotting.
Antibodies and immunoblotting
The following antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology: ALK (Catalog No. 3333), phospho-ALK tyrosine
1604 (Catalog No. 3341), phospho-ALK tyrosine 1278/1282/
1283 (Catalog No. 3983), ribosomal protein S6 (Catalog No.
2317), phospho-S6 (Catalog No. 5364), phospho-ERK tyrosine
202/204 (Catalog No. 9101), ERK (Catalog No. 9102), phosphoAKT serine 473 (Catalog No. 9271), AKT (Catalog No. 9272),
HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (Catalog No. 7076), and HRPconjugated anti-rabbit (Catalog No. 7074). The Flag M2 antibody (Catalog No. F1804) and the actin antibody (Catalog No.
A2066) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
For immunoblotting, cells were harvested, washed in PBS,
and lysed in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0/150 mmol/L sodium
chloride/5 mmol/L magnesium chloride/1% Triton X-100/
0.5% sodium deoxycholate/0.1% SDS/40 mmol/L sodium
fluoride/1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Lysates were subjected
to SDS-PAGE followed by blotting with the indicated antibodies and detection by Western Lightening ECL reagent
(Perkin Elmer). Images were quantified using a Bio-Rad Gel
Doc XR and Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).
Cell viability and apoptosis assay
For viability experiments, cells were seeded in 96-well plates
at 25% to 33% confluency and exposed to drugs alone or in
combination the following day. At 72 hours after drug addition, Cell Titer Blue Reagent (Promega) was added and
fluorescence was measured on a Spectramax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. All experimental points were set up in hextuplicate replicates and were performed at least 2 independent
times. IC50s were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 5
for Windows. The curves were fit using a nonlinear regression
model with a log (inhibitor) versus response formula.
For apoptosis experiments, cells were seeded in 12 well
plates at 25% confluency and treated in triplicate with ALK
TKI. At 72 hours after drug addition, cells were collected,
washed in PBS, and stained with annexin V and propidium
iodide according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vybrant
Apoptosis Assay Kit, Invitrogen). Data were collected on a
FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences) and processed using WinList
flow cytometry analysis software (Verity Software).
Expression constructs
cDNAs for EML4-ALK E13;A20 (variant 1), EML4-ALK E20;
A20 (variant 2), EML4-ALK E6b;A20 (variant 3b), and KIF5BALK were synthesized by Geneart. The cDNAs were subcloned
into a 3Flag-CMV vector (Sigma-Aldrich). The L1196M and
C1156Y mutations were introduced into the cDNA encoding
the E13;A20 variant using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) with mutant specific primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNAs were fully re-sequenced in
each case to ensure that no additional mutations were introduced. A cDNA encoding MET was obtained from Origene.

Xenograft studies
Nude mice (nu/nu; Harlan Laboratories) were used for in
vivo studies and were cared for in accordance with guidelines
approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Research
Animal Resource Center. Eight-week-old female mice were
injected s.c. with 5 million H3122 cells together with matrigel.
Once tumors reached an average volume of 290 mm3, mice
were randomized and dosed via oral gavage with either PF1066, X-376, or X-396 at the indicated doses. A uniform volume
for administration (200 mL) was used for each group. Mice
were observed daily throughout the treatment period for signs
of morbidity/mortality. Tumors were measured twice weekly
using calipers, and volume was calculated using the formula:
length  width2  0.52. Body weight was also assessed twice
weekly. The experiment was terminated after 3 weeks of
treatment. Tumor samples were collected at either 2 or 8
hours after the last treatment. Each sample was cut in halves;
half was preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin and half
was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C.
Pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies
Nude mice (nu/nu; Harlan Laboratories) were injected with
H3122 cells as earlier. Once tumors reached an average volume
of 450 mm3, a total of 27 athymic mice harboring H3122
tumors were randomized and dosed via oral gavage with
either 50 mg/kg X-376, 25 mg/kg X-396, or the control vehicle.
Two, five, and fifteen hours after the single treatment (3
tumors/timepoint/group), mice were killed and serum was
collected for assessment of drug concentration using an LCMS–based bioanalytical method by the DMPK group of the
Scripps Research Institute (Jupiter, Florida).
To determine if PF-1066, X-376, and X-396 can cross the
blood–brain–barrier (BBB), each compound was dosed to 3
male C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) at their respective efficacious doses (PF-1066: 50 mg/kg, X-376 50 mg/kg,
and X-396 25 mg/kg). Two hours after dosing, mice were
killed. Blood and brain tissues were collected and analyzed
for drug concentration. The bioanalysis was done at the
Scripps Research Institute as described.
For toxicity studies, the test article or vehicle was administered to all groups orally once a day for 10 consecutive days at
a dose volume of 10 mL/kg. Observations for morbidity,
mortality, injury, and the availability of food and water were
conducted twice daily for all animals. Clinical observations
were conducted twice daily. Body weights were measured and
recorded every other day during the study. Food consumption
was measured and recorded daily during the study. Blood
samples for clinical pathology evaluations were collected from
all animals on day 11. Blood samples from an additional 2
animals/sex/group (minus vehicle group) were collected for
determination of test article plasma concentrations at designated time points on day 10. The toxico-kinetic parameters
were determined for the test articles from concentration–time
data in the test species. At study termination, necropsy
examinations were performed, organ weights were recorded,
and selected tissues were microscopically examined. Studies
were done in accordance with the current International

Results
X-376 and X-396 are aminopyridazine-based kinase
inhibitors with increased in vitro potency against ALK
compared to PF-1066
Based on protein structure modeling of ALK, we designed a
series of small molecule inhibitors that we hypothesized
would have greater potency and specificity against ALK.
Although PF-1066 is an aminopyridine-based small molecule
inhibitor, the lead compounds we identified, X-376 and X-396,
are aminopyridazine-based structures. These agents all share
a common hydrophobic 2,6-dichloro-3-fluoro-phenylethoxy
group as well as a similar kinase hinge binding group compared to PF-1066, but differ significantly in their side chains
(Fig. 1A). We next performed KINOMEscan (Ambit Biosciences) analysis to test the specificity of the ALK TKIs. Briefly,
KINOMEscan is a competition binding assay that quantitatively measures the ability of a test compound to compete
with an immobilized, active-site directed ligand (22, 23). Initial
KINOMEscan screens on racemic forms of PF-1066 and X-376
showed different but overlapping binding constant specificity
profiles (Fig. 1B). Supplementary Table S1 summarizes the
differential ability of these agents to inhibit the activity of 96
kinases; the vast majority of kinases are minimally affected.
Additional Ambit-based dose–response profiling suggested
that X-376 and X-396 were approximately 10-fold more potent
against ALK but less specific for MET compared to PF-1066
(Table 1; ref. 17).
To attempt to explain the increased potency for X-376 and
X-396 against ALK on a structural level, we generated a model
of X-376 within the ATP binding pocket of the ALK tyrosine
kinase domain (Fig. 1C and D). This model was based on the
crystal structure of PF-1066 in the MET kinase domain (PDB
code: 2WGJ). The hydrophobic interaction, especially the
aromatic stacking, between Y1269 and the dichloroflorophenyl moiety, is conserved between PF-1066 and X-376 (Fig. 1D).
However, for hydrogen bonds with hinge residues (E1197 and
M1199), X-376 may be able to form 2 additional hydrogen
bonds (C and D) compared to PF-1066. The hydrogen bond


distances are 2.08A, 1.95A, 2.45A, and 2.66A for A, B, C, and D,
respectively, in this model. Although the hydrogen bonds C
and D are weaker than A and B, they may still contribute to the
binding of X-376, thereby further increasing this compound's
affinity for ALK.
X-376 and X-396 are more potent ALK inhibitors than
PF-1066
To compare and contrast the in vitro effects of X-376 and X396 versus PF-1066, we tested the ability of all 3 agents to inhibit
the growth of 4 different cancer cell lines known to harbor ALK
fusions or point mutations. In H3122 lung cancer cells harboring EML4-ALK E13;A20 (variant 1), X-376 and X-396 were 3- and
10-fold more potent, respectively, than PF-1066 (IC50: PF-1066

growth seen with X-376 treatment correlated with increased
apoptosis, as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for
Annexin V and propidium iodide (Fig. 2E).
By contrast, the ALK inhibitors did not significantly inhibit
the growth of cells driven by other mutant kinases. For

Cell lines were treated with ALK TKIs for 72 hours. Cell titer blue assays were performed to assess cell proliferation. IC50 values were
calculated using GraphPad Prism software with a nonlinear regression. Each experiment was performed at least 2 times.

(IC50 of 1.4 mmol/L) and even less sensitive to treatment with
X-376 or X-396 (IC50 of >3 mmol/L for each drug; Supplementary Table 2 and Fig. S1D). Finally, the ALK TKIs had minimal
growth inhibitory effects against HepG2 (liver) cells (Table 2
and Supplementary Fig. S1A); this assay is often used as a
measure for potential hepatotoxicity (31).
We also compared the efficacy of PF-1066 and X-396 to
TAE-684 in H3122 cells. Unlike PF-1066 and X-396, TAE-684
has a diaminophenylpyrimidine scaffold and inhibits ALK,
IGF-1R, and IR in biochemical assays (16). As previously
reported in the literature, TAE-684 is a potent inhibitor of
H3122 cell growth (5) with an IC50 of 5 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S1E). However, this compound is not in clinical
development.
To confirm the target specificity of X-376 and X-396, we
assessed the ability of the compounds to inhibit ALK kinase
activity using auto-phosphorylation of an ALK fusion protein as
a surrogate measure. Two hundred and ninety-three cells were
transiently transfected with an expression plasmid encoding
flag-tagged EML4-ALK E13;A20 cDNAs and treated with PF1066, X-376, or X-396. Immunoblotting of lysates showed that all
3 compounds inhibited the activity of ALK in a concentrationdependent manner. Consistent with data from the growth
inhibition assays, X-376 and X-396 led to greater reductions
in phospho-ALK at lower concentrations of drug (Fig. 2F).
We further evaluated the effects of PF-1066 and X-396 on
endogenous ALK phosphorylation and potential downstream
signaling pathways in H3122 lung cancer cells harboring the
EML4-ALK E13;A20 fusion. Compared to PF-1066, X-396 inhibited ALK phosphorylation at lower concentrations of drug
(Fig. 2G). This was accompanied by corresponding inhibition
of the downstream targets, ERK and AKT. We also found that
phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate, ribosomal protein S6,
was inhibited with ALK TKI treatment (Fig. 2G). Collectively,

www.aacrjournals.org

these data show that X-376 and X-396 are more potent ALK
inhibitors than PF-1066.
X-376 and X-396 display less activity against MET than
PF-1066
PF-1066 has higher binding affinity for MET versus ALK in
Ambit KINOMEscan assays (17). By contrast, X-376 and X396 displayed similar binding constants for both kinases
(Table 1). To assess if such differences in binding correlated
with less activity against MET in cells, we determined the
ability of X-376 and X-396 to inhibit the growth of MKN-45
gastric carcinoma cells, which are known to be highly
sensitive to MET inhibitors (27). Compared to X-376 and
X-396, PF-1066 was 3-fold more potent against MKN-45 cells
(IC50s: PF-1066 51 nmol/L, X-376 150 nmol/L, X-396 156
nmol/L; Fig. S2A and Table 2). Consistent with these data,
PF-1066 more effectively reduced MET autophosphorylation
in surrogate kinase assays (Fig. S2B). Thus, X-376 and X-396
are both more potent and more specific inhibitors of ALK
compared to PF-1066.
Antitumor activity and pharmacokinetic properties of
X-376 and X-396 in vivo
We next examined the effects of X-376 and X-396 in vivo
against H3122 xenografts. A pharmacokinetic study revealed
that both X-376 and X-396 showed substantial bioavailability
and moderate half-lives in vivo (Supplementary Table S2).
Based on these data, we selected twice a day dosing for initial
efficacy studies. We treated nude mice harboring H3122
xenografts with either X-376 at 50 mg/kg bid or X-396 at
25 mg/kg bid. Both agents significantly delayed the growth of
tumors compared to vehicle alone (Fig. 3A). The efficacy was
similar to that seen with PF-1066 dosed at 50 mg/kg bid
(Fig. S3). Additional doses and schedules of X-376 and X-396

have not yet been examined. However, based on our toxicity
studies, we show that X-396 dosed at 25 mg/kg is probably well
below the maximum tolerated dose, suggesting that higher
doses and greater efficacy can be achieved.
At the doses used in these xenograft experiments (PF-1066:
50 mg/kg bid; X376: 50 mg/kg bid; X-396 25 mg/kg bid),
plasma levels inversely correlated with cellular potency. For
example, although PF-1066 and X-396 were the least and most
potent ALK inhibitors, respectively, the plasma level at 2 hours
after dosing was highest for PF-1066 (10.19 mmol/L), lower for
X-376 (6.27 mmol/L), and lowest for X-396 (2.28 mmol/L;
Supplementary Table S2). The plasma levels followed the
same trend at 5 and 15 hours after dosing, respectively. These
findings suggest that inhibitors such as PF-1066 may need to

4926

be administered at higher doses to achieve the same efficacy of
the more potent compounds.
In the xenograft experiments, both X-376 and X-396
appeared well-tolerated in vivo. Mouse weight was unaffected
by either treatment (Fig. 3B). Drug-treated mice appeared
healthy and did not display any signs of compound-related
toxicity. To further assess potential side effects of X-376
and X-396, we performed additional systemic toxicity and
toxico-kinetic studies in Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats. Following
10 days of repeated oral administration of X-376 at 25, 50, and
100 mg/kg or X-396 at 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg in SD rats, all
animals survived to study termination. The no significant
toxicity (NST) levels were determined to be 50 mg/kg for
X-376 and 80 mg/kg for X-396. The only statistically significant

observation at NST levels was a <50% increase of the liver
enzymes, AST and ALT. At NST levels, X-376 achieved an AUC
of 41 mmol/Lh and a Cmax of 5.04 mmol/L, whereas X-396 had
an AUC of 66 mmol/Lh and a Cmax of 7.19 mmol/L (Supplementary Table S2). These Cmax values are >50 and >400 times
the drugs’ respective IC50's for H3122 cell growth inhibition.
Notably, PF-1066 at the selected (tolerated) Phase 3 dose
results in a plasma level (500 nmol/L at 250 mg bid;
ref. 32) that is only 3 times its IC50. The NST Cmax value
of X-396 also compares favorably with the 2-hour plasma
levels required for efficacy in mice (7.19 mmol/L vs.
2.28 mmol/L; Supplementary Table S2). Taken together, these
data suggest that X-396 is able to inhibit ALK effectively
at doses far below those that are well tolerated.
Penetration of ALK TKIs in the brain
In EGFR mutant lung cancer, patients with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs may relapse in the brain. One contributing
factor is that the dose of drug in the brain is only one hundredth
that in the blood (33). In anticipation of a similar phenomenon
occurring in patients with ALK fusion positive lung cancers
treated with ALK TKIs, we examined the penetration of PF1066, X-376, and X-396 across the BBB in mice. Each drug was
dosed to 3 male C57BL/6J mice at their respective efficacious
doses (PF-1066: 50 mg/kg, X-376 50 mg/kg, and X-396 25 mg/
kg). Two hours after dosing, mice were killed. Blood and brain
tissues were collected and analyzed for drug concentration.
Brain penetration was defined as the ratio of compound
concentration in brain tissues compared to that in plasma.
We found that X-396 had comparable brain penetration to PF1066, whereas X-376 had less (Supplementary Table S3).
Because PF-1066 at the selected Phase 3 dose achieves a plasma
level of 500 nmol/L (32), projection of results from this animal
study to humans would suggest that the concentration of PF1066 in human brain would be only 80 nmol/L (16% of plasma
level), which is below the IC50 (180 nmol/L) for inhibiting H3122
cell growth (Supplementary Table S4). By contrast, if X-396
were also to achieve a plasma level of 500 nmol/L in humans,
its brain concentration would be about 65 nmol/L (13% of
plasma level), which is significantly higher than its IC50 of 15
nmol/L (Supplementary Table S4). These data suggest that
drugs such as X-396 could lead to higher efficacy against ALKfusion positive brain metastases. However, further studies with
additional sampling times will be required to most accurately
assess intracranial drug levels.
X-376 and X-396 are effective against multiple ALK
variants found in NSCLC, including ALK mutations
associated with acquired resistance to PF-1066
To date, at least 11 different ALK rearrangements have been
reported in NSCLC (3–10). Although all contain the ALK
kinase domain starting at the region encoded by exon 20,
most contain variable portions of EML4 at the N-terminus.
Another fusion involves KIF5B (7). Whether these variants
display differential sensitivity to ALK TKIs is unknown but
could influence the outcome of clinical trials with ALK inhibitors. We therefore compared the efficacy of X-376 against
4 different ALK variants in surrogate kinase assays. 293 cells

www.aacrjournals.org

were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding Flagtagged versions of 4 ALK rearrangements: 3 of the most
common EML4-ALK variants, EML4-ALK E13;A20 (variant
1), EML4-ALK E20;A20 (variant 2), EML4-ALK E6b;A20
(variant 3b; refs. 6, 34), and KIF5B-ALK. After treatment with
X-376, cell extracts were subjected to immunoblotting with
antibodies against phospho-ALK and Flag. All fusions displayed dose-dependent inhibition of ALK kinase activity
(Fig. 4A). Based on quantitative examination of the immunoblotting results (data not shown), no major differences in
sensitivity were observed among the 4 variants in these in vitro
surrogate-kinase assays. However, additional studies in cell
lines where these ALK variants are the oncogenic "drivers" are
needed to establish more subtle differences.
We next examined the efficacy of X-396 against 2 point
mutations in EML4-ALK recently identified in patients with
acquired resistance to PF-1066, L1196M, and C1156Y (35).
L1196 of ALK corresponds to the "gatekeeper" site, and C1156
is positioned adjacent to the N-terminal helix aC (35). To
determine how the L1196M and C1156Y mutations affect ALK
fusion proteins, we individually introduced the specific mutations into EML4-ALK E13;A20 cDNAs and performed surrogate
kinase assays as described. Introduction of L1196M and
C1156Y into the EML4-ALK fusion protein led to a greater
baseline level of phosphorylation (Fig. 4B and C), suggesting
that these mutations lead to increased kinase activity. As
expected, the L1196M and C1156Y mutants did reduce the
sensitivity of the wild-type ALK fusion protein to both PF-1066
and X-396, however, the degree of reduction was less for X-396.
To expand on these results from the surrogate kinase
assays, we evaluated the biological impact of each mutation
on drug sensitivity in Ba/F3 cells. Expression of EML4-ALK
E13;A20 WT, L1196M, and C1156Y (Fig. 4E) each led to IL3
independent growth of Ba/F3 cells. In accord with our data
above from tumor cell lines with ALK genomic alterations, X396 was 10 fold more potent than PF-1066 in inhibiting the
growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK E13;A20 wild type
(IC50 for WT: PF-1066 250 nmol/L, X-396 22 nmol/L; Fig. 4E
and Table 2). As expected, the presence of the L1196M and
C1156Y point mutants reduced the sensitivity of the EML4ALK fusion to both PF-1066 and X-396 (Fig. 4E). However, the
IC50 values for X-396 against the L1196M and C1156Y mutants
were still in the 100 nmol/L or less range (IC50 for L1196M:
PF-1066 1815 nmol/L, X-396 106 nmol/L; IC50 for C1156Y: PF1066 458 nmol/L, X-396 48 nmol/L; Fig. 4E and Table 2).
Because the therapeutic window is greater for X-396, these
data suggest that X-396 has the potential to overcome these
second-site drug resistance mutants.
Combined ALK/mTOR inhibition enhances growth
inhibition of ALK fusion positive lung cancer cell lines
As shown earlier, treatment of H3122 cells with ALK TKIs
led to a decrease in phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate,
ribosomal protein S6 (Fig. 2G). Previous studies in NPM-ALK
positive lymphoma cell lines have shown that the mTOR
inhibitor, rapamycin, decreases proliferation and increases
apoptosis in ALK fusion positive lymphoma cells (36). Given
these 2 observations, we sought to determine if mTOR

Novel ALK Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors

improving therapeutic outcomes of cancer patients. Mutant
ALK represents 1 clinically relevant molecular marker, found
in a diverse spectrum of malignancies, including ALCL,
NSCLC, IMT, and neuroblastoma. Constitutive activation of
ALK, either through oncogenic fusions or point mutation, not
only initiates tumorigenesis in these cancers but also renders
them sensitive to treatment with ALK small molecule inhibitors. The first ALK inhibitor in clinical trials, PF-1066, has
showed promising results in NSCLCs harboring ALK fusions
(20). However, despite displaying impressive radiographic
regressions, patients have already showed disease progression
on drug. Thus, novel agents and drug combinations need to be
developed to optimize the care of patients with tumors
harboring ALK genomic alterations.
To this end, we report here identification and characterization of X-376 and X-396, 2 potent and highly specific ALK small
molecule TKIs. In multiple different experiments, including
Ambit kinome screens, in vitro growth inhibition studies using
oncogene-dependent cancer cell lines, and surrogate kinase
assays, X-376 and X-396 were more potent inhibitors of ALK

inhibition could synergize with ALK inhibition in EML4-ALK
fusion positive NSCLC cell lines. Rapamycin alone caused a
small but reproducible decrease in the proliferation of H3122
and H2228 cells (Fig. S4). Strikingly, when rapamycin was
combined with X-396, we observed a synergistic decrease of
cell growth in both H3122 (Fig. 5A) and in H2228 (Fig. 5B) cells.
Drug synergism was assessed by both the Chou-Talalay and
Mix-Low Methods (Supplementary Table S5 and Fig. S5; refs.
37, 38). Consistent with these data, phosphorylation of the
mTOR substrate, S6, was decreased in the presence of rapamycin and was further diminished in the presence of both
rapamycin and X-396 (Fig. 5C). Overall, these data suggest that
cotreatment with ALK and mTOR inhibitors may represent a
strategy to increase the therapeutic efficacy for patients with
ALK fusion positive lung cancer.

tumors defined by molecular criteria holds promise for

and less potent inhibitors of MET compared to PF-1066. Both
X-376 and X-396 also showed potent antitumor activity in vivo
with favorable pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles and with
broader therapeutic windows than PF-1066. The improved
specificities of X-376 and X-396 could translate into improved
antitumor responses as well as potentially decreased adverse
drug reactions for patients treated with these agents.
Multiple ALK fusion variants have been described in NSCLC
(3–10). The majority are composed of EML4-ALK fusions.
Previous work has shown that cells harboring the EML4ALK E13;A20 fusion variant are highly sensitive to a small
molecule ALK inhibitor (TAE684), whereas cells harboring the
EML4-ALK E6a/b;A20 variant are less so (5). These observations raise the question as to whether different ALK fusion
proteins show differential sensitivity to ALK TKIs, which could
impact outcomes in clinical trials of patients with ALK fusion
positive lung cancer. Here, using surrogate kinase assays on
lysates from cells ectopically expressing 3 of the most common EML4-ALK variants (EML4-ALK E13;A20, EML4-ALK E20;
A20, and EML4-ALK E6b;A20; refs. 6, 34) as well as the KIF5BALK fusion, we did not find any major differences in sensitivity
to X-376. These data suggest that current approaches such as
fluorescent in situ hybridization for ALK fusions to identify
patients eligible for treatment with ALK TKIs are reasonable
even though such techniques do not distinguish among
different variants. Further correlations among the different
variants and clinical outcomes await detailed analysis of
ongoing clinical trials.
Despite promising initial results with ALK TKIs, patients
whose disease initially responded to therapy have already
developed progressive disease. Mechanisms of "acquired resistance" to ALK TKIs are just beginning to be elucidated.
Recently, Choi and colleagues reported the finding of
L1196M and C1156Y point mutations in a patient with lung
cancer who developed acquired resistance to PF-1066 (35).
L1196, corresponds to the "gatekeeper" site in ALK. Mutations
at this site alter drug binding (39) and are commonly found in
tumor cells from cancer patients with acquired resistance to
kinase inhibitors. C1156 is positioned adjacent to the Nterminal helix aC (35). The structural mechanism for how
mutation at this site confers resistance to ALK TKIs remains
to be elucidated. When the ALK L1196M and C1156Y mutations were introduced into the EML4-ALK E13;A20 fusion,
kinase activity, as assessed by ALK autophosphorylation,
was not inhibited by up to 300 nmol/L of PF-1066. By contrast,
ALK autophosphorylation was significantly diminished by X396, albeit at higher concentrations required to block autophosphorylation of the wild-type fusion. These results were
recapitulated in Ba/F3 cells where introduction of the L1196M
and C1156Y point mutants reduced the sensitivity of cells to
both PF-1066 and X-396, however, the IC50 values for X-396
against these mutants were still 100 nmol/L or less.

Because both of these point mutations have been found in
clinical samples from patients with acquired resistance to ALK
TKIs, treatment with X-396 may represent one strategy to
overcome them. In addition, our brain drug penetration
studies suggest that X-396 can achieve high enough concentrations to treat intra-cerebral metastases effectively should
they arise in patients.
Finally, an emerging paradigm in the design and implementation of targeted agents is the combination of such
agents to improve therapeutic efficacy. The serine–threonine
protein kinase, mTOR, plays an important role in protein
translation and cell growth and has been implicated as a
therapeutic target in a variety of malignancies. Previous
studies in NPM-ALK positive lymphoma cell lines have shown
that the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, decreases proliferation
and increases apoptosis in ALK fusion positive lymphoma
cells (36). Interestingly, recent studies performed in an EML4ALK mouse model showed only modest antitumor efficacy
with combined PI3K/mTOR and MEK inhibition (40). However, the combination of an ALK inhibitor plus an mTOR
inhibitor was not evaluated. Our results show that this combination can synergistically decrease cell proliferation in 2
different EML4-ALK lung cancer cell lines. These data indicate
that mTOR signaling may play critical roles in ALK fusion
signaling in general, which is currently not well characterized.
Clinically, these data also suggest that trials of ALK TKIs
in combination with rapamycin or analogous agents should
be considered to enhance the antitumor efficacy of ALK
inhibitors.
