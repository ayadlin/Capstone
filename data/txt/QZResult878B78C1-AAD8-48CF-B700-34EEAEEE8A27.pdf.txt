ABSTRACT
A major impediment to the response of tumors to chemotherapy is that the large
majority of cancer cells within a tumor are quiescent in G0/G1, where cancer cells
are resistant to chemotherapy. To attempt to solve this problem of quiescent cells
in a tumor, cancer cells were treated with recombinant methioninase (rMETase),
which selectively traps cancer cells in S/G2. The cell cycle phase of the cancer cells
was visualized with the fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI). At
the time of rMETase-induced S/G2-phase blockage, identified by the cancer cells’
green fluorescence by FUCCI imaging, the cancer cells were administered S/G2dependent chemotherapy drugs, which interact with DNA or block DNA synthesis
such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, or 5-fluorouracil. Treatment of cancer cells with
drugs only, without rMETase-induced S/G2 phase blockage, led to the majority of the
cancer-cell population being blocked in G0/G1 phase, identified by the cancer cells
becoming red fluorescent in the FUCCI system. The G0/G1 blocked cells were resistant
to the chemotherapy. In contrast, trapping of cancer cells in S/G2 phase by rMETase
treatment followed by FUCCI-imaging-guided chemotherapy was highly effective in
killing the cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

approximately 75% of cancer cells far from (> 100 µm)
tumor blood vessels of an established tumor are in G0/G1.
FUCCI imaging demonstrated that cytotoxic agents killed
only proliferating cancer cells at the surface, or near blood
vessels, and had little effect on the majority of quiescent
cancer cells within a tumor. Resistant quiescent cancer
cells restarted cycling after the cessation of chemotherapy.
Thus, the low chemo-sensitivity of most solid tumors is
at least in part due to the large majority of cancer cells in
solid tumors being quiescent [1].
FUCCI imaging was used for real-time visualization
of the cell cycle kinetics of invading cancer cells in
3-dimensional (3D) Gelfoam® histoculture. Cancer
cells in G0/G1 phase in Gelfoam® histoculture migrated
more rapidly and further than the cancer cells in S/G2/M
phase. After entry into S/G2/M phases, cancer cells ceased

The problem of quiescent cancer cells within a
tumor
The resistance of most solid tumors and metastases
is a major problem in chemotherapy. The phase of the cell
cycle determines to a great extent whether a cancer cell
can respond to a given drug. We previously monitored
real-time cell cycle dynamics of cancer cells throughout a
live tumor intravitally using a fluorescence ubiquitination
cell cycle indicator (FUCCI). Approximately 90%
of cancer cells in the center and 80% of total cells of
an established tumor are in G0/G1 phase. Similarly,

migrating and restarted migrating after division when
the cells re-entered G0/G1. Migrating cancer cells were
resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy, since they were
mostly in G0/G1 [2].
One solution to the problem of large numbers of
cells in G0/G1 in a tumor is to block the cancer cells in S/
G2 rather than G0/G1.

methionine starvation was exploited for selective
chemotherapy in vitro. In cultures that were initiated
with equal amounts of cancer cells and human diploid
fibroblasts, substitution of homocysteine and doxorubicin
for methionine in the culture medium followed by
methionine repletion with vincristine was totally effective
at selectively eliminating a methionine-dependent
human sarcoma and three methionine-dependent human
carcinomas. This chemotherapeutic procedure used was
not toxic to normal cells growing alongside the cancer
cells and was ineffective when conducted totally in
methionine-containing medium [8].
In the present report, we demonstrate that using
recombinant methioninase (rMETase) to deplete
methionine and thereby trap cancer cells in S/G2,
and FUCCI imaging to detect the onset of the block,
chemotherapy could become effective on the S/G2-trapped
cancer cells.

Methionine dependence
Methionine dependence, the elevated methionine
requirement for cancer cell proliferation, is the property
of the majority of cancer cell types [3]. There have been
several therapeutic strategies to target the methionine
dependence of cancer cells. Methionine-starvation therapy,
such as with a methionine-free diet or methionine-depleted
total parenteral nutrition, prolonged the survival time
of tumor-bearing rodents [4, 5]. Methionine-free total
parenteral nutrition in combination with chemotherapeutic
drugs extended the survival of patients with high-stage
gastric cancer [4]. Prostate-cancer patients have been
treated with a methionine-depleted diet [5].
A reversible growth arrest of cancer cells has
been produced by replacement of methionine in the
growth medium by its immediate metabolic precursor,
homocysteine, This growth arrest is accompanied by
a reduction in the percentage of mitotic cells in the cell
population. Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell
sorting demonstrated that the cells are arrested at the S/
G2 phase of the cell cycle. This is in contrast to a G1phase accumulation of cancer cells, which occurs only in
methionine-supplemented medium at very high densities
and which is similar to the G1 block seen in cultures of
normal fibroblasts at high density [6]. The molecular
mechanism of the S/G2 block has subsequently been
investigated [7].
The S/G2 trap that that cancer cells enter upon

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Recombinant methionine (rMETase) block of
cancer cells in S/G2 visualized by FUCCI imaging
After seeding on 35 mm glass dishes and culture
over night, HeLa cells were treated with rMETase at a
dose of 1.0 unit/ml. rMETase blocked HeLa and MCF-7
cells in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle as visualized by
FUCCI imaging (Figure 1).
After seeding on 35 mm glass dishes and culture
over night, HeLa and MCF-7 cells were treated with
rMETase either at 0.25 or 0.5 units/ml for 48 hours.
FUCCI imaging showed that by 24 hours there was a large
shift in the cancer-cell population from G0/G1 to S/G2/M
(Figure 2). For HeLa cells, the percentage of cells in G0/G1
decreased from approximately 80% to approximately 20%

by 48 hours in the presence of either 0.25 or 0.5 units/ml
rMETase. Approximately 80% of the population became
blocked in S/G2. For MCF-7 cells, approximately 40% of
the untreated cells were in G0/G1. After 48 hours treatment
with 0.25 units/ml rMETase, the percentage of cells in G0/
G1 fell to 20% and with 0.5 units rMETase, the percentage
decreased to approximately 15%. Approximately 85% of
the cells became trapped in S/G2 (Figure 2).

G1 from approximately 60% to 80%. With combination
treatment of DOX and rMETase, the number of HeLa cells
in G0/G1 was reduced to approximately 0 with almost all
cells blocked in S/G2. For MCF-7 cells, approximately
40% of the untreated cells were in G0/G1 and increased
to more than 80% after treatment with DOX alone for 72
hours. In the presence of rMETase and DOX for 72 hours,
approximately 40% of the cells were in G0/G1 (Figure 3).
DOX alone, at 2.5 µg/ml, killed approximately 25%
of the MCF-7 cells. The combination of DOX, at 2.5 µg/
ml, and rMETase, at 0.25 units/ml, killed approximately
80% of the cells (P<0.01 compared to DOX alone).
DOX, at 5 µ/ml, and rMETase, at 0.25 units/ml, killed
approximately 90% of the cells (P<0.01 compared to
DOX alone) (Figure 4).
For MCF-7 cells treated with 5-FU, at 15 µg/
ml, approximately 40% of the cells were killed. With
the combination of rMETase (0.25 units/ml) and 15 µg/
ml 5-FU, approximately 80% of the cells were killed
(P<0.01 compared to 5-FU alone). With 5-FU, at 30 µg/
ml, approximately 40% of the cells were killed, and the
combination of 5-FU, at 30 µg/ml, and 0.25 units/ml
rMETase, approximately 90% of the cells were killed

Cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs killed cancer cells
trapped in S/G2 by rMETase
During rMETase-induced blockage in S/G2,
doxorubicin (DOX) effectively killed the cancer cells.
After overnight culture, HeLa cells and MCF-7 cells
were treated with 0.25 unit/ml rMETase for 48 hours.
The cancer cells were then treated with 0.5 μg/ml DOX
(HeLa cells) or 2.5 μg/ml DOX (MCF-7) for 72 hours.
HeLa cells were also treated with 0.5 μg/ml DOX, and
MCF-7 cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml DOX for 72
hours, both without rMETase. With HeLa cells, DOX
treatment alone resulted in an increase of cells in G0/

Previously developed concepts and strategies of
highly selective tumor-targeting [9-20] can take advantage
of spatial–temporal cell-cycle imaging of cancer cells
described in the present and previous [1, 2, 21] reports.
Previously, different methods of cancer-cell
synchronization have been used in order to sensitize
the cells to chemotherapy. Such methods include

(P<0.01 compared to 5-FU alone) (Figure 4).
The strategy and technology described in this report,
whereby cancer cells are selectively and synchronously
trapped by rMETase in S/G2, the most drug-sensitive phase
of the cell cycle, where they were identified by FUCCI
imaging and then treated with S/G2-phase-specific-drugs
was highly effective compared to standard chemotherapy.

Figure 3: FUCCI cell cycle analysis during chemotherapy with and without rMETase. After overnight culture, HeLa
cells (a, b and c) and MCF-7 cells (d, e and f) were treated with 0.25 unit/ml rMETase for 48 hours and, then were treated with 0.5 μg/ml
doxorubicin (HeLa cells) or 2.5 μg/ml doxorubicin (MCF-7) for 72 hours. For conventional chemotherapy, after culture for 48 hours, HeLa
cells (a, b and c) and MCF-7 cells (d, e and f) were treated with 0.5 μg/ml DOX (HeLa cells) or 2.5 μg/ml DOX (MCF-7) for 72 hours. a, b,

chronotherapy which attempts to target the time of day
when most cancer cells in tumors are thought to be
dividing [22]. Excess thymidine or its analogs have also
been used to arrest cancer cells in S-phase, where they are
sensitized to S-phase drugs such as 5-FU or methotrexate,
and after release of the block, the cancer cells enter
M-phase synchronously where they are sensitive to
M-Phase drugs such as paclitaxel [23-25].
Cancer-cell synchronization with cell-cycle-phasespecific drugs, such as cytosine arabinoside, methotrexate
and hydroxyorea have also been carried out [26-30], for
example, to block cells in S-phase which can sensitize
the cancer cells to an M-phase drug, such as paclitaxel,
administered after the S-phase block is lifted [26-30].
The calcium channel blocker mibefradil has
been used to synchronize glioblastoma cells at the G1/S
checkpoint, thereby making the glioblastoma cells
sensitive to first-line therapy temozolomide [31]. Statins,
such as Lovastatin, can be used to synchronize cancer in
G1 by preventing formation of an early intermediate in
the cholesterol pathway essential for progression of cells
through early G1 phase [32, 33]. After the block is lifted,
the cancer cells can be effectively treated with an S-phase
drug.
PDO332991, a pyridopyrimidine, has been shown to
be a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and
6 and induced early-G1 arrest in primary human myeloma
cells and other cancer cell types, including breast cancer
in vitro and in cancer xenograft models. As PDO0332991
acts reversibly, it can be used as a synchronizing agent and
when used for sequence combination with cytotoxic agents
is active against myeloma cells in vitro and in vivo [34].
A cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor RO-3306 reversibly
arrests 95% of treated cells in G2 phase. These cells
rapidly enter mitosis after the block is lifted and become
sensitive to M-phase drugs [35]. Growth factors such as
EGF, G-CSF, and IL-6 can stimulate cancer cell out of
G0, making them sensitive to chemotherapy agents such
as docetaxel [36-38]. Reviews on cell synchronization are
available [39-42].
The critical advantage of rMETase synchronization
(blockage) is that, unlike the methods described above, it
is cancer specific [3,6,8,43-51].

drugs. This approach has significant clinical potential
since almost all cancer cell types tested are methionine
dependent and arrest in S/G2 when deprived of methionine
with an agent such as rMETase.

CONCLUSIONS

Time-lapse images of HeLa and MCF-7 cells stably
transfected with FUCCI vectors were acquired using a
confocal laser scanning microscope (FV1000; Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan) [1, 2, 21].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Recombinant Methioninase (rMETase)
Recombinant
L-methionine
α-deamino-γmercaptomethane lyase (methioninase, METase) [EC
4.4.1.11] from Pseudomonas putida has been previously
cloned and was produced in Escherichia coli (AntiCancer,
Inc., San Diego, CA). rMETase is a homotetrameric PLP
enzyme of 172-kDa molecular mass [52].

FUCCI (Fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle
indicator)
The FUCCI probe was generated by fusing mKO2
(monomeric Kusabira Orange2) and mAG (monomeric
Azami Green) to the ubiquitination domains of human
Cdt1 and geminin, respectively. These two chimeric
proteins, mKO2-hCdt1(30/120) and mAG-hGem(1/110),
accumulate reciprocally in the nuclei of transfected cells
during the cell cycle, labeling the nuclei of G1 phase cells
red and nuclei of cells in S/G2 phase green [53].

FUCCI-expressing HeLa cells and MCF-7 cells
Plasmids expressing mKO2-hCdt1 or mAG-hGem
(MBL, Nagoya, Japan) were transfected into HeLa cells
and MCF-7 cells. HeLa cells were grown in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/
streptomycin. MCF-7 were grown in MEM-supplemented
with L-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum and
penicillin/streptomycin [53].

Imaging of FUCCI-expressing cancer cells

A major problem for successful chemotherapy is the
very high percentage of quiescent G0/G1 cancer cells in
a tumor. The present report has demonstrated a solution
to the problem by selectively trapping cancer cells in S/
G2, with recombinant methioninase (rMETase). The S/G2trapped cancer cells became sensitive to chemotherapy
which targets cells in this phase of the cell cycle, which
are the majority of the most widely-used chemotherapy
drugs. Alternatively, the rMETase-induced S/G2 block can
be lifted and the cells can become sensitive to M-phase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cell viability
For cell viability determinations before and after
chemotherapy, with and without rMETase, the cells were
stained with crystal violet, and the relative number of cells
was quantified using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
