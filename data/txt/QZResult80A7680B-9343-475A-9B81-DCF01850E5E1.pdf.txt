Pak1 Kinase Links ErbB2 to b-Catenin in Transformation of
Breast Epithelial Cells

Abstract
p21-Activated kinase-1 (Pak1) is frequently upregulated in human breast cancer and is required for
transformation of mammary epithelial cells by ErbB2. Here, we show that loss of Pak1, but not the closely
related Pak2, leads to diminished expression of b-catenin and its target genes. In MMTV-ErbB2 transgenic mice,
loss of Pak1 prolonged survival, and mammary tissues of such mice showed loss of b-catenin. Expression of a
b-catenin mutant bearing a phospho-mimetic mutation at Ser 675, a speciﬁc Pak1 phosphorylation site, restored
transformation to ErbB2-positive, Pak1-deﬁcient mammary epithelial cells. Mice bearing xenografts of ErbB2positive breast cancer cells showed tumor regression when treated with small-molecule inhibitors of Pak or
b-catenin, and combined inhibition by both agents was synergistic. These data delineate a signaling pathway from
ErbB2 to Pak to b-catenin that is required for efﬁcient transformation of mammary epithelial cells, and suggest
new therapeutic strategies in ErbB2-positive breast cancer. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3671–82. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The ErbB2 oncogene is ampliﬁed in approximately 30% of
human breast cancers and represents a clinically useful
therapeutic target (1). ErbB2 proteins frequently heterodimerize with ErbB1 or ErbB3, and these heterodimers activate a signaling program that drives cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, loss of polarity, and increased motility
and invasiveness (2). Key signaling pathways that emanate
from ErbB2 include, but are not limited to, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR, Ras/ERK, and Src/Fak
networks (3).
p21-activated kinases (Pak) are Cdc42/Rac–activated serine-threonine protein kinases that regulate the PI3K/Akt, Ras/
ERK, and Src/Fak signaling pathways (4, 5). Pak1 is required for
activation of Akt, perhaps due to a scaffolding function that
links Pdk1 to Akt (6, 7). In Ras/ERK signaling, Pak1 phosphorylates c-Raf at S338 and Mek1 at S298, sites that are required for
full activation of these proteins in some cell types (8, 9). Pak1
also acts downstream in the Src/Fak pathway, as an effector for
the small GTPase Rac1 (10, 11) Loss of Pak1, induced by siRNA,
expression of dominant-negative alleles, gene disruption, or
small-molecule inhibitors, has been shown to block transformation in vitro by oncogenic forms of Kras, ErbB2, and KSHV
(9, 12–16). In addition, Pak1 is frequently overexpressed in

human breast, ovary, bladder, uterine, and brain cancer, due to
ampliﬁcation of the PAK1 gene in an 11q13 amplicon (9), and
has oncogenic properties when expressed in mouse breast
epithelial cells and tissues (17, 18). However, the role of Pak1 in
tumorigenesis in vivo, and the particular signaling pathways
affected, is not deﬁned. In addition, the apparent special role of
Pak1, versus the closely related and broadly expressed Pak2, is
not understood.
In this work, we examined the distinct roles of Pak1 and Pak2
in cellular and animal models of ErbB2-driven breast cancer.
We found that inhibition of Pak1, but not Pak2, impedes
transformation by ErbB2 in a 3-dimensional (3D) cell culture
system, but that loss of either Pak1 or Pak2 causes loss of both
ERK and Akt activation. A phospho-proteomic screen revealed
that Pak1-deﬁcient, but not Pak2-deﬁcient, ErbB2 cells showed
almost total loss of b-catenin expression, and that exogenous
expression of a stabilized b-catenin or a mutant form bearing a
phosphomimic residue at a known site of Pak1 phosphorylation (S675E), restored the ability of ErbB2 to transform Pak1deﬁcient cells. Finally, we showed that small-molecule inhibitors of Pak or b-catenin blocked transformation by ErbB2 in 3D
culture and tumorigenesis by ErbB2 in mouse xenografts.
Combined use of anti-Pak and anti-b-catenin agents was
synergistic. These ﬁndings establish Pak1 as a new target in
ErbB2-driven breast cancer and deﬁne a new mechanism of
action primarily through the b-catenin, but not the ERK or Akt,
signaling pathways.

Cell lines and 3D cell culture
Tumors from MMTV-Neu:Pak1þ/þ and MMTV-Neu:Pak1/
animals were dissected, rinsed with PBS and minced, then
treated with 0.2% collagenase for 2 hours at 37 C. Cells were
washed several times with serum-free Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium (DMEM), and ﬁnally with low calcium medium
supplemented with 5% horse serum. Tissues kept in low calcium medium were transferred to T-25 ﬂasks coated with
0.1% gelatin and incubated in a 37 C incubator overnight.
The next day, supernatants containing ﬂoating cells were
transferred and seeded into new ﬂasks and maintained with
regular media changes until conﬂuency to prevent ﬁbroblast
growth. Fibroblast-free cell populations were derived typically after 6 to 8 weeks. In vitro proliferation was measured
by seeding approximately 1  105 cells on 0.1% gelatin-coated
T25 ﬂasks. At speciﬁc time points, cells were trypsinized
and counted using Trypan blue exclusion analysis. All analyses used cells passaged less than 6 times.
10A.ErbB2 cells (MCF-10A cells expressing a chimeric form
of ErbB2; ref. 19) were maintained in DMEM/F12 (Gibco BRL)
supplemented with 5% donor horse serum, 20 ng/mL EGF
(Harlan Bioproducts), 10 mg/mL insulin (Sigma), 1 ng/mL
cholera toxin (Sigma), 100 mg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma), 50
U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin. For 3D cultures, approximately 5,000 cells were plated atop reconstituted basement membrane (rBM) in 8-well slide chambers as
described (19). To activate chimeric ErbB proteins, 1 mmol/L
AP1510 was added to the growth medium. MCF-7, MDA-MB231, BT-474, and SK-BR3 were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231cells were grown
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, BT-474 cells were
grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and SK-BR3 were
grown in McCoy's 5A supplemented with 10% FBS. BT-474R
cells were a kind gift from Dr. Jose Baselga (Massachusetts
General Hospital, Boston, MA).
Tissue preparation, histology, immunohistochemistry,
and immunoblotting
All tumor samples and control tissues were ﬁxed overnight
in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, and embedded in parafﬁn. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections were used
for diagnostic purposes and unstained sections for immunohistochemical studies. Protein concentration was determined,
and equal amounts of total proteins were separated on SDSPAGE. A detailed list of antibodies used is contained in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Tumor xenografts
All studies described in this article were carried out under
approved protocols following Fox Chase Cancer Center IACUC
guidelines. Detailed methods are contained in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using the unpaired
Student t test except for survival curves where the log P
rank test was used. Values of P < 0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant.

Results
Pak1, but not Pak2, knockdown inhibits proliferation
and rescues apoptosis in 10A.ErbB2 cells
To investigate the roles of Pak1 and Pak2 in ErbB2 signaling,
we used doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA;
ref. 15). Pak1 and Pak2 are both expressed in MCF10A cells
and in ErbB2-positive or ErbB2-negative mammary epithelial
cells such as BT-474, SK-BR3, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). MCF10A-ErbB2 cells (henceforth termed
10A.ErbB2), which activate ErbB2 in response to AP1510 (19),
were stably transduced with a doxycycline-inducible shRNA
speciﬁc to Pak1 or Pak2, respectively, and the cells were
assessed for proliferation and apoptosis. Upon doxycycline
induction, the Pak1 and Pak2 shRNA-infected cells showed
speciﬁc loss of their intended target (Fig. 1A). Loss of Pak1, but
not Pak2, impeded the proliferation (Fig. 1B) and survival (Fig.
1C) of 10A.ErbB2 cells, similar results were observed in BT-474,
SK-BR3, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary Fig. S1B–
S1D). These data suggest that only Pak1 is required for ErbB2
effects on 2 of the cardinal features of transformation: cell
division and apoptosis.
Pak1 knockdown restores normal acinar morphology in
3D cell culture
To assess the effects of Pak1 and Pak2 on acinar development and architecture, we plated the shRNA-expressing 10A.
ErbB2 cells in a 3D Matrigel matrix. Under such conditions,
induction of ErbB2 induces a striking phenotype characterized
by formation of multilobular acini (Fig. 1D, a and b), loss of
central apoptosis (Fig. 1D, c and d), and increase in proliferation (Fig. 1D, e and f). Expression of Pak1-directed shRNA had
little effect on noninduced 10A.ErbB2 cells (Fig. 1D, g, i, and k),
but strongly suppressed the transformed phenotype of induced
cells (Fig. 1D, h, j, and l). In contrast, Pak2-directed shRNA had
little effect on acinar structure irrespective of ErbB2 expression
(Fig. 1D, m–r).
As Pak1 and Pak2 have similar catalytic properties, we
sought to uncover differences in their behavior in breast
epithelial cells. We and others had earlier established that
Pak1 can be driven into the nucleus upon EGF receptor
activation in mammary epithelial cells (20, 21); we therefore
asked whether Pak2 responded in a similar manner. 10A.ErbB2
cells, stably transduced with GFP-Pak1 or GFP-Pak2, were
stimulated with EGF or AP1510 for 10 minutes and the
distribution of Pak1 and Pak2 determined by immunoﬂuorescence (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C) and by subcellular fractionation (Supplementary Fig. S2D). As expected, a substantial
fraction of Pak1 redistributed from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus upon EGF or AP1510 stimulation. In contrast, Pak2
was never detected in the nucleus.
Molecular pathways affected by Pak1 and Pak2
Paks have been implicated in regulating ERK signaling
downstream of Ras via phosphorylation of Mek1 and c-Raf
(5, 12, 22, 23), and Pak1 has also been implicated in activating
Akt via a scaffolding interaction with PDK1 (6, 13). Given that
loss of Pak1, but not Pak2, impeded ErbB2 oncogenic signaling,
we asked whether these 2 Pak isoforms affected different

containing several dozen ErbB2-relevant phospho-protein–
speciﬁc antibodies was probed with lysates from control and
Pak1 knockdown 10A.ErbB2 cells. This experiment showed
that phosphorylation of a number of known Pak1 direct and
indirect substrates, including ERK, c-Raf, BAD, and Akt, were
strongly reduced in Pak1 knockdown cells (Fig. 2B). The
protein showing the greatest loss of phosphorylation was
b-catenin, a protein that has recently been shown to be
stabilized by Pak1-mediated phosphorylation (24, 25).
Immunoﬂuorescence and immunoblot analyses showed a
severe reduction in total b-catenin (Fig. 2C and D). Similar
effects were noted in SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells, in which
expression of a dominant-negative form of Pak1, or treatment with the Pak inhibitor PF-3758309 (26) induced loss of

signaling pathways. We examined the activation of ERK and
Akt in 10A.ErbB2 cells bearing Pak1- or Pak2-speciﬁc shRNA.
Interestingly, reduction of either Pak1 or Pak2 by shRNA had
a profound negative effect on both ERK and Akt activation
(Fig. 2A). In contrast, expression of a constitutively active form
of Pak1 in a panel of breast cancer cell lines had only a modest
effect in ERK and Akt activation (Supplementary Fig. S3A). This
result was expected, as Pak1 is generally thought to be necessary, but not sufﬁcient, for activation of these pathways (4).
As ERK and Akt activation was lost in cells depleted of
either Pak1 or Pak2, but only Pak1 depletion affected transformation by ErbB2, we used a phospho-antibody array to
examine additional signaling pathways that might be differentially regulated by these 2 Pak isoforms. An array

b-catenin expression (Supplementary Fig. S3B). This loss of
b-catenin was accompanied by reduction in almost all
known b-catenin target genes (Fig. 2E), including c-Myc and
cyclin D (Fig. 2E). Similar effects on b-catenin, c-Myc, and
cyclin D expression were noted in 10A.ErbB2 cells treated
with the Pak inhibitor PF-3758309 (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
As relatively few studies have measured the effect of ErbB2
activation on Wnt signaling (27–29), we asked whether
crossing-linking ErbB2 promoted relocalization of b-catenin
from the plasma membrane to the nucleus in human mammary epithelial cells. As a positive control, we treated 10A.
ErbB2 cells with Wnt3a, which resulted in relocalization of
approximately 50% of the b-catenin to the nucleus within 1
to 2 hours of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Similarly,
a substantial amount (40%) of b-catenin relocalized to the
nucleus in response to ErbB2 activation. These results
suggest that, in this cell type, ErbB2 activation activates
Wnt signaling.

Loss of Pak1 impedes ErbB2-mediated carcinogenesis
and is associated with reduced levels of b-catenin in vivo
To determine whether the observed effects of Pak1 in ErbB2
signaling were relevant in vivo, we crossed MMTV-Neu mice
with WT and Pak1/ mice and followed the natural history of
Neu:Pak1þ/þ and Neu:Pak1/ female mice over the course of 2
years. Pak1 deletion is well tolerated in mice, with no effects on
general health, longevity, or fertility (30). Consistent with prior
reports (31), half the MMTV-Neu mice developed palpable
breast tumors by 9 months of age (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the
MMTV- Neu/Pak1/ mice showed a much longer latency to
tumor formation and tumor growth, with half the mice showing detectable disease by 16 months. This result shows that
Pak1 negatively affects the progression of ErbB2/Neu-initiated
breast cancer in this mouse model.
Immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue revealed
strong activity for ErbB2, ERK, Akt, b-catenin, and Pak in

Akt, b-catenin, and Pak in Neu:Pak1/ mice (Fig. 3B). These
results show that, as in mammary epithelial cell lines (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. S3), Pak1 is required for the activation of
ERK, Akt, and b-catenin downstream of ErbB2 in vivo. These
results also suggest that other Pak isoforms (e.g., Pak2 and
Pak3) are not redundant for Pak1 in ErbB2 signaling in
mammary epithelial cells.
We derived epithelial cell lines from mammary tumors from
Neu/Pak1þ/þ and Neu:Pak1/ mice and assessed their growth
and signaling properties. Neu/Pak1þ/þ cells grew faster than
Neu:Pak1/ cells (Fig. 3C), showed greater viability following
treatment with actinomycin D (Fig. 3D), had greater motility
(Fig. 3E, Supplementary Movies S1 and S2), and were more
invasive (Fig. 3F). Moreover, Neu:Pak1/ cells displayed a
defective cell cycle and a unilobular morphology when plated
in a 3D Matrigel matrix and compared with Neu:Pak1þ/þ and
other breast cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5 and S6).
Thus, many of the hallmark features of transformation were
impeded in mouse-derived ErbB2 mammary epithelial cells
lacking Pak1. As in 10A.ErbB2 cells, basal and EGF-stimulated
levels of phospho-ERK, phospho-Akt, and total b-catenin were
decreased in mammary epithelial cells derived from Neu:
Pak1/ mice (Supplemetary Fig. S7). Phosphoylation of
b-catenin at a destabilizing site (S33) was augmented in
Pak1/ cells, whereas phosphorylation at a stabilizing,
Pak1-catalyzed site (S675), was diminished, consistent with
the overall reduction in b-catenin expression noted in these
cells. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3b at an
inhibitory site (S9) was also decreased in Pak1/ cells, as

might be expected in cells with reduced Akt activity. These data
suggest that Pak1 is required for b-catenin stabilization in
mammary epithelial cells derived from Neu mice.
Role of b-catenin in ErbB2-mediated signaling
As Pak1 was required for b-catenin expression in mammary
epithelial cells as well as for ErbB2-mediated oncogenesis, we
asked whether activators or inhibitors of Wnt signaling affected ErbB2 signaling. We ﬁrst tested the effects of overexpressing
wild-type or a stabilized form of b-catenin (S33Y), as well as a
phosphomimetic mutant at the putative Pak1 phosphorylation
site (S675E) in 10A.ErbB2 cells (24, 32). All these forms of
b-catenin induced multilobular acini even in the absence
of ErbB2 stimulation (Fig. 4A–C). Conversely, expression of
b-catenin S675A, which lacks the Pak1 phosphorylation site,
did not on its own induce this multilobular phenotype and
blocked the ability of ErbB2 to confer this phenotype. Finally,
treatment of cells with a small-molecule inhibitor of Pak or
b-catenin blocked formation of aberrant acini in ErbB2-stimulated cells, but the Pak inhibitor did not affect b-catenin
S675E-mediated transformation (Fig. 4E–H).
In vitro synergy between Pak and b-catenin inhibitors
As Pak1 and b-catenin seem to act in a linked pathway
downstream of ErbB2 (Fig. 5A), we next tested the effects of
small-molecule inhibitors of Pak1 and b-catenin, alone and
together, on the survival of ErbB2-driven breast cancer cells.
These compounds included PF-3758309, which potently suppresses both group A and B Paks (26), iCRT14 and iCRT3, which

BT-474 and SK-BR3, respectively), had a nearly identical effect
on cell survival. The IC50 values for iCRT14 in BT-474 and SKBR3 cells were 71 and 107 nmol/L, respectively; the IC50 values
for iCRT 3 were 52.3 and 82 nmol/L, respectively; whereas the
IC50 values for PF-3758309 were 62.5 and 85.7 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 5B). When the compounds were coadministered,
however, a marked synergistic effect was noted [combination
index (CI) < 0.5; Fig. 5B and Table 1]. Coadministration of
PF-3758309 and iCRT14 yielded CI values of 13.3 and 20.4
nmol/L respectively, and coadministration of PF-3758309 and
iCRT3 yielded CI values of 19.3 and 31 nmol/L respectively,
indicating a high degree of synergy. Interestingly, synergistic
effects were not seen in cells treated with the tankyrase
inhibitor JW55 plus PF-3758309, most likely because b-catenin, once stabilized by phosphorylation at S675, is not readily
susceptible to destruction by cleavage. However, the combination of Pak and either of the iCRT b-catenin–targeting
agents, which block interactions of b-catenin with TCF, did
not merely produce cytostasis, but also resulted in cell death,
increasing the frequency of apoptosis by nearly a factor of
2 (Fig. 5C).
Inhibition of tumor growth by small-molecule inhibitors
of Pak and b-catenin
We next tested the effects of these signaling inhibitors on the
growth of BT-474 xenografts. BT-474 cells were xenografted to
severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice and tumors
were allowed to form for 7 days. The mice were then treated
with vehicle, Pak inhibitor PF-3758309, b-catenin inhibitor
iCRT14, or PF-3758309 plus iCRT14, for 15 days. Tumor
volumes were assessed every 5 days, at which time the animals
were sacriﬁced.
Treatment with iCRT14 had a marked negative effect on
tumor growth, yielding tumors of about one-half the volume,
and one-fourth the weight, of tumors in untreated animals (Fig.
6A–C). PF-3758309 had an even more dramatic effect, essentially abrogating tumor growth. Interestingly, animals treated
with the combined Pak and b-catenin inhibitors showed no
tumor growth but also displayed extensive areas of necrosis in
tumor remnants (Fig. 6C and E).
We then assessed signaling activity in these tumor tissues,
using immunoblots (Fig. 6D).

3678

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

Treatment with the Pak inhibitor reduced Pak activity as
expected, whereas treatment with the b-catenin inhibitor did
not. Conversely, tumor tissues from iCRT14-treated mice
showed loss of b-catenin targets (Myc and cyclin D), but little
change in pPak1, pERK, or pAkt. Combined treatment with PF3758309 and iCRT14 reduced signaling activity in the ERK, Akt,
and b-catenin pathways. Analysis of markers of cell proliferation and apoptosis revealed that PF-3758309 treatment prevented cell-cycle progression and induced apoptosis (Fig. 6E),
whereas iCRT14 had a little effect on cell-cycle progression but
increased apoptosis. When coadministered, the inhibitors
blocked cell-cycle progression and caused extensive apoptosis
and necrosis (Fig. 6E).
Sensitization of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer
cells by Pak and b-catenin inhibitors
As Pak1 and b-catenin seem to act in a linked pathway
downstream of ErbB2, we assessed whether blocking these
proteins would augment growth inhibition by an anti-ErbB2
agent. For these experiments, we chose the cell line BT-474R,
known to be resistant to trastuzumab in vitro (35). As with
parental BT-474 and SK-BR3 cells, we observed a synergistic
inhibition of survival when BT-474R cells were treated with Pak
plus b-catenin inhibitors (Fig. 7A). As expected, addition of
trastuzumab alone had little effect on these resistant cells (Fig.
7B). Addition of either the Pak or the b-catenin inhibitor
slightly increased apoptosis in BT-474R cells; however, in
combination with trastuzumab, these inhibitors increased the
number of apoptotic cells to more than 30% and approximately
40%, respectively. When combined, the Pak and b-catenin
inhibitors increased apoptosis in BT-474R cells to approximately 15%; this effect was greatly accentuated by the addition
of trastuzumab (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that inhibiting
downstream components of ErbB2 signaling such as the Pak/
b-catenin signaling axis, can resensitize trastuzumab-resistant
cells to ErbB2-targeted therapeutic antibodies.

Discussion
Pak1 has previously been implicated in breast cancer for the
following reasons: the PAK1 gene is frequently ampliﬁed in
human breast cancer; PAK1 ampliﬁcation is associated with
resistance to tamoxifen; transgenic expression of an activated

PAK1 allele induces transformation of mammary epithelial
cells in culture and induces breast cancer in mice; and expression of dominant-negative alleles, shRNAs, or treatment with
Pak inhibitors, impede the growth and/or normalize the
morphology of various breast cancer cell lines in tissue culture
(13, 15–18). However, none of these studies examined the
particular roles of the 2 most highly expressed group A Pak
alleles, Pak1 and Pak2, nor did they use clinically relevant
inhibitors, nor establish key oncogenic signaling pathways
activated by Pak in mouse breast cancer models. Here, we
show that (i) blockade of Pak1, but not Pak2 expression or
activity in vitro inhibits ErbB2 function; (ii) loss of either Pak1
or Pak2 causes loss of both ERK and Akt activation, but loss of
Pak1 uniquely causes destabilization of b-catenin; (iii) loss of
Pak1 in vivo delays oncogenesis and progression in MMTV-Neu
mice; (iv) restoring b-catenin expression by means of a stabilized b-catenin mutant or a Pak1 phospho-site mimic of

b-catenin overcomes the effects of Pak inhibition; and (v)
small-molecule inhibitors of Pak or b-catenin block transformation by ErbB2 in cells and in mice. These results, coupled
with recent work showing that Pak1 can phosphorylate b-catenin and establish a ErbB2-Pak-b-catenin linkage that is essential for transformation of mammary epithelial cells by ErbB2.
Of the 6 Pak isoforms, Pak1 in particular has garnered much
attention with respect to tumorigenesis, as ampliﬁcation of the
PAK1 gene, with concomitant overexpression of the Pak1
protein, is commonly observed in human cancers of the breast,
ovary, and bladder (9). Unlike other oncogenic serine/threonine protein kinases such as BRAF, activating point mutations,
or deletions of PAK1 have not been found in human cancers,
despite the ability of activated PAK1 mutants to transform cells
in vitro and in vivo. PAK1 gene ampliﬁcation seems to be
particularly relevant in human breast cancer, as it has been
shown that such ampliﬁcation is associated with resistance

to tamoxifen treatment and decreased survival (36, 37). In
addition, cells bearing such ampliﬁcations have recently been
shown to be "addicted" to Pak1 signaling, with elevated sensitivity to Pak1 depletion (15). In contrast, the role of other Paks
such as Pak2 in breast cancer is not well established. Pak1 and
Pak2 have very similar catalytic properties (38) and, in some
cases, share redundant functions. Interestingly, we found that
both Pak1 and Pak2 are required for activation of ERK and
Akt in 10.ErbB2 cells (Fig. 2). It is possible that these proteins
heterodimerize or, in the case of ERK activation, that each
Pak isoform targets a different element in the pathway, for
example, one Pak isoform might phosphorylate c-Raf, and
the other might phosphorylate Mek. In either event, effects
on ERK and Akt signaling cannot explain our observation
that loss of Pak1, but not Pak2, impedes ErbB2 oncogenic
signaling. Instead, our results suggest that other pathways,
such as the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, are more likely to mediate
these effects, as only Pak1 depletion affects b-catenin levels
and b-catenin target gene transcription in the cell types we

3680

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

examined. Why is Pak1 unique in this respect? Although
the catalytic properties of Pak1 and Pak2 are indistinguishable in vitro, the 2 proteins localize differently (39, 40). For
example, Pak1 is driven into the nucleus following EGF
stimulation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells (20) and in MCF10A cells (Supplementary Fig. S2;
ref. 21), whereas Pak2 is not (Supplementary Fig. S2).
In addition, the effects of gene deletion are quite different
for Pak1 and Pak2: deletion of the former is associated with
a mild phenotype, whereas deletion of the latter results
in early embryonic lethality (8). Why Pak1, but not Pak2,
affects b-catenin levels in mammary epithelial cells is unknown, and it will be of interest to determine whether these
different behaviors reside in different intrinsic substrate
selection or differences in the noncatalytic, N-terminal–
regulatory domains of these kinases.
The role of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway in ErbB2 signaling in breast cancer is incompletely understood. In
general, ErbB2 positivity in breast cancer is associated
with a luminal phenotype, whereas Wnt activation is more
commonly associated with a basal phenotype (41). However, multiple lines of evidence suggest important links
between ErbB2 and b-catenin signaling. First, ErbB2 physically associates with b-catenin, and such complexes are
associated with human inﬁltrating ductal breast and also
with MMTV-c-Neu and MMTV-Wnt-1 mouse models of
breast cancer (28). Second, ErbB2 phosphorylates b-catenin
at Tyr 654, leading to dissociation of the E-cadherin-b-catenin membrane complex and increased signaling to Wnt
target genes such as cyclin D1 (29). In addition, ErbB2 has
been reported to transcriptionally activate expression of
the Wnt pathway target gene Jab1 via an Akt/b-catenin
pathway in breast cancer cells (42). These observations are
supported by recent publications showing a positive correlation between HER2/neu expression and nucleocytoplasmic (i.e., non–plasma membrane) b-catenin in nodepositive carcinomas (P ¼ 0.02) and in HER2/neu-induced
mouse mammary tumors, with activation of Wnt pathway
genes (27), as well as eradication of breast tumor-initiating
cells by pharmacologic inhibitors of Wnt/b-catenin signaling in this mouse model (43).
Recently, it has been reported that Pak1 has a direct role
in b-catenin stabilization in colon cancer cells, via phosphorylation of b-catenin at Ser 675 (24, 44) and Ser 663/675
(45). As we have previously shown that ErbB2 activates Pak1
(16), we here propose that Pak1 is a required signaling
element linking ErbB2 activation to b-catenin in mammary
epithelial cells, and that such activation is necessary for
oncogenesis. This view is supported by the loss of b-catenin
and target gene activation in Pak1-depleted mammary
epithelial cells or Pak1-deleted mammary tissue, and the
blockade of tumor growth by Pak or b-catenin inhibition
seen in animals xenografted with ErbB2-positive tumor cells.
Small-molecule Pak inhibitors have recently entered clinical
trials and it should soon be possible to evaluate the potential
of such agents in human cancer. We suggest that such agents
may be useful in 2 general settings: cancers that have 11q13
ampliﬁcation, such as a large fraction of breast, ovarian,

thyroid, and bladder cancers, and cancers driven by oncogenes
or loss of tumor suppressors for which Pak1 is thought to be
an obligate signaling element, such as Kras, ErbB2, NF1, and
NF2 (4, 9, 46). Given the results reported in this study, it will
also be of interest to determine whether such Pak inhibitors are
also useful in the setting of activated Wnt signaling, and/or if
such agents could be effectively combined with Wnt pathway
inhibitors.
