ABSTRACT
Phorbol ester (PMA or TPA), a tumor promoter, can cause either proliferation
or cell cycle arrest, depending on cellular context. For example, in SKBr3 breast
cancer cells, PMA hyper-activates the MEK/MAPK pathway, thus inducing p21 and cell
cycle arrest. Here we showed that PMA-induced arrest was followed by conversion
to cellular senescence (geroconversion). Geroconversion was associated with active
mTOR and S6 kinase (S6K). Rapamycin suppressed geroconversion, maintaining
quiescence instead. In this model, PMA induced arrest (step one of a senescence
program), whereas constitutively active mTOR drove geroconversion (step two).
Without affecting Akt phosphorylation, PMA increased phosphorylation of S6K
(T389) and S6 (S240/244), and that was completely prevented by rapamycin. Yet,
T421/S424 and S235/236 (p-S6K and p-S6, respectively) phosphorylation became
rapamycin-insensitive in the presence of PMA. Either MEK or mTOR was sufficient to
phosphorylate these PMA-induced rapamycin-resistant sites because co-treatment
with U0126 and rapamycin was required to abrogate them. We next tested whether
activation of rapamycin-insensitive pathways would shift quiescence towards
senescence. In HT-p21 cells, cell cycle arrest was caused by IPTG-inducible p21
and was spontaneously followed by mTOR-dependent geroconversion. Rapamycin
suppressed geroconversion, whereas PMA partially counteracted the effect of
rapamycin, revealing the involvement of rapamycin-insensitive gerogenic pathways.
In normal RPE cells arrested by serum withdrawal, the mTOR/pS6 pathway was
inhibited and cells remained quiescent. PMA transiently activated mTOR, enabling
partial geroconversion. We conclude that PMA can initiate a senescent program by
either inducing arrest or fostering geroconversion or both. Rapamycin can decrease
gero-conversion by PMA, without preventing PMA-induced arrest. The tumor promoter
PMA is a gero-promoter, which may be useful to study aging in mammals.

INTRODUCTION

cells can be either quiescent or senescent [21-25]. In
quiescent cells, mTOR is deactivated [20, 26-33]. For
example, serum withdrawal deactivates mTOR and
MEK/MAPK pathways, causing reversible quiescence in
normal cells [20, 26, 34-36]. In contrast, in senescent cells,
mTOR is active [26, 29, 30, 33, 37- 40] Senescent cells are
characterized by a large flat morphology (hypertrophy),
active metabolism, differentiation-specific hyperfunctions, and irreversible loss of proliferative potential
[21, 23, 39, 41-58]. A senescent program includes 2 steps:
(a) cell cycle arrest and (b) conversion from arrest to
senescence [22]. For example, p21 can arrest cell cycle

The mTOR (Target of Rapamycin) signaling
pathway is activated by nutrients (glucose, amino
and fatty acids), growth factors, cytokines, oxygen,
hormones and many other signals [1-4]. In turn, mTOR
stimulates cellular size growth and metabolism as well as
differentiation-specific functions [3-19]. In cycling cells,
mTOR drives mass growth. If the cell cycle is arrested,
then mTOR drives “futile growth” or geroconversion,
converting reversible arrest to irreversible senescence [5,
20-22]. Senescence is not just cell cycle arrest: arrested

but does not inhibit mTOR. Therefore, mTOR drives
geroconversion from p21-induced arrest to senescence.
Since mTOR is fully active in cell culture (high levels of
mitogens, nutrients and oxygen), it is usually sufficient
for a cell to get arrested, in order to become senescent
[22]. Rapamycin (and other rapalogs), certain tumor
suppressors, including p53, serum-withdrawal, hypoxia
and contact inhibition all suppress geroconversion by
deactivating mTOR [19, 28, 59-71], thus maintaining
quiescence instead. And vice verse, growth factor
receptors, Ras, Raf, MEK, PI3K and Akt, which all
activate the mTOR/S6K/S6 pathway, are involved
in cellular senescence and cancer [72-76]. They are
gerogenes, driving gerogenic conversion and oncogenic
transformation [21, 64]. We can predict that activators
of these pathways will promote both cancer and aging.
Phorbol ester is the most well known tumor promoter,
which activates MEK/ERK and mTOR/S6K signaling
pathways [77-85].
Depending on the cellular context, PMA can
cause either cell cycle progression or cell cycle arrest
by inducing both cyclin D1 and p21 via the MEK/ERK
pathway [43, 86-88]. Cell cycle arrest by itself can lead
to senescence, if mTOR is not inhibited. Furthermore,
the ability to activate mTOR predicts that PMA may be
gero-promoter (promote geroconversion). Accordingly,
it can cause cellular senescence, first by arresting cell
cycle and then by converting this arrest to senescence
(geroconversion). Cell cycle arrest caused by PMA is
well studied. For example in SKBR3 cells, PMA overactivates MEK/ERK/MAPK, which in turn induces p21
and cell cycle arrest [86]. Here we show that cells become
senescent, because mTOR is constantly active in SKBR3
cells. By blocking geroconversion, rapamycin rendered
PMA-treated cells quiescent but not senescent. We also
investigated cell lines that are completely resistant to
PMA-induced arrest. In these cell lines, arrest was
caused by either ectopic p21 or by serum starvation. In
these cases, PMA increased geroconversion. Use of
three cellular models demonstrated that, regardless of its
ability to provoke senescence by arresting cell cycle (first
step), PMA also empowers a second step of a senescent
program: geroconversion.

PMA-arrested cells acquire senescent morphology (Fig.
1A). We found that PMA caused a large flat morphology
with nucleoli enlargement and beta-Gal positivity (Fig. 1
A). Next, we treated cells with PMA in the absence of
serum, expecting that serum withdrawal might inhibit the
mTOR pathway and prevent senescence. However, PMA
caused senescence both in the presence and absence of
the serum. In agreement with previous report [86], PMA
rapidly activated ERK1/2 followed by p21 and cyclin D1
induction (Fig. 1 B). We also measured phosphorylation of
S6 at S235/236 and S240/244 sites, as markers of mTOR
activity. Noteworthy, S235/236 sites are phosphorylated
by S6K (a substrate of mTOR) and by RSK (MEKdependent), whereas S240/244 sites are presumably
phosphorylated by S6K only [77-85]. Levels of p-S6 were
high in both proliferating cells and serum-starved cells
and become even higher after PMA treatment (Fig. 1B).
First, this explains why arrested SKBR3 cells become
senescent and, second, why they become senescent both
in the presence and absence of serum.
These senescent cells lost the reversibility or
regenerative potential (RP). In fact, PMA-treated SKBR3
cells poorly proliferated after PMA was washed out (Fig.
1 C, D) (Note: PMA is known to be poorly washable. Yet,
even without washing, PMA-induced p21 disappears by
day 3 [86] and this is a functional equivalent of washing
PMA out).

Rapamycin suppresses geroconversion in PMAarrested cells
As shown in Fig. 2A, PMA caused typical senescent
morphology in 30% of SKBR3 cells. Rapamycin by itself
slightly inhibited proliferation but did not cause senescent
morphology (Fig 2A and Fig. S1). Importantly, rapamycin
abrogated PMA-induced senescent morphology (Fig.
2A). We also determined the reversibility potential by
the ability of PMA-treated cells to form colonies in drugfree medium. The ability to restart proliferation or RP
was decreased in PMA-pretreated cells, measured when
PMA was washed out (Fig. 2 B). Rapamycin increased
the number of colonies approximately 5-fold (Fig. 2B).
We also excluded that rapamycin forced PMA-treated
cells to proliferate in the presence of PMA. (Fig. S1A).
As expected, co-addition of rapamycin and PMA inhibited
proliferation (Fig. S1A). Also, rapamycin alone inhibited
proliferation (Fig. S1), whereas inhibiting proliferation,
rapamycin prevented PMA-induced loss of the potential
to proliferate or RP. As emphasized previously,
“proliferation” and “potential to proliferate” should not
be confused. Rapamyin never induces proliferation but
preserves the potential. Perhaps terms “regenerative
potential (RP)”, “reversibility potential (RP)”, “the
potential”, “reversibility” should be used to distinguish
“proliferative potential” from “proliferation”. So rapamyin

RESULTS
PMA-induced senescence in SKBR3 cells
As it was investigated in detail in SKBR3 cells
[86], PMA activates the MEK/ERK pathway, which
in turn induces both p21 and cyclin D1, causing G1
and G2 cell cycle arrest. As it was shown later, hyperaccumulation of cyclin D1 in arrested cells is a marker
of senescence [39, 88]. Therefore we checked whether

in part independent of mTOR.

Both mTOR and MEK pathways are sufficient to
phosphorylate S6

Rapamycin partially abrogates PMA-induced
hyper-activation of mTOR targets

Since PMA activates the MEK/ERK pathway, we
investigated whether inhibition of MEK can prevent
PMA-induced phosphorylation of S6K and S6. PMA alone
stimulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (dramatically),
S6K (moderately) and only marginally S6, because S6
has been already near-maximally phosphorylated in
proliferating untreated SKBR3 cells (Fig. 3B). Also,
SKBR3 cells were treated with PMA in the presence of
either U0126 (U), rapamycin (R), U+R or Torin 1 (an
inhibitor of both TORC1 and TORC2). As expected,
U0126, an inhibitor of MEK, abrogated PMA induced
p-ERK1/2 but did not affect p-S6K and p-S6 at all sites
tested (Fig. 3B). In contrast, rapamycin abrogated p-S6K
(at both sites) and p-S6 (at both sites) in the absence
of PMA-stimulation. Yet in the presence of PMA,
while abrogating phospho-T389-S6K and phospho-

PMA induced p-ERK1/2 and p-S6K in both
isoforms p70 and p85 (T412) (Fig. 3A). As expected,
rapamycin did not affect PMA-induced phosphorylation
of ERK1/2. Rapamycin abrogated p-S6K at T389 and
p-S6 at S240/244 both in the absence and presence of
PMA (Fig. 3A). Also, rapamycin completely eliminated
phospho-T421/S424-S6K and phospho-S235/236 -S6
in the absence of PMA. However, rapamycin only
marginally affected levels of phospho-T421/S424-S6K
and phospho-S235/236 -S6 in the presence of PMA. In
other words, PMA caused phosphorylation of S6K and
S6 at these sites, even in the presence of rapamycin. This
indicates that PMA activates S6K and S6 phosphorylation

PMA increased geroconversion in HT-p21 cells
arrested by p21

S240/244-S6, rapamycin did not abrogate PMA-induced
rapamycin-resistant (RR sites, for brevity) sites: namely,
phospho-T421/S424-S6K and phospho-S235/236-S6 sites.
Interestingly, Torin 1, which inhibited both complexes of
mTOR and prevented phosphorylation of all substrates of
mTORC1, as shown for phospho-4EBP1 (T37/46), failed
to affect RR sites in the presence of PMA (Fig. 3B). In
other words, PMA caused phosphorylation of RR sites
in the presence of either rapamycin, U0126 or Torin 1
(Fig. 3B). Only a combination of U+R prevented PMAinduced RR sites (phospho-T421/S424-S6K and phosphoS235/236-S6). We conclude that, in the presence of
PMA, S6K can be fully phosphorylated at T421/S424 via
mTORC1 (rapamycin sensitive) and via MEK (rapamycininsensitive) pathways (Fig. 4). Similarly, S6 can be fully
phosphorylated on S235/236 via mTORC1 (rapamycin
sensitive) and via MEK (rapamycin-insensitive) pathways
in the presence of PMA (Fig. 4). Noteworthy, PMA did
not cause AKT (T308) phosphorylation. Rapamycin
increased Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). This suggests
that Akt itself (unlike mTORC1) does not empower
geroconversion.
We emphasize that rapamycin only partly suppressed
geroconversion. We investigated whether PMA-induced
phospho-T421/S424-S6K and phospho-S235/236 S6
contribute to geroconversion in the presence of rapamycin.
As we discussed, addition of U0126 to rapamycin
eliminated PMA-induced RR phosphorylation (Fig.
3B). However, this combination did not further suppress
senescent morphology in comparison to rapamycin alone
(Fig. 5).

We next investigated whether PMA contributes to
senescence independently of cell cycle arrest. In HT-p21
model, cell cycle arrest was induced not by PMA but by
IPTG-inducible p21 (Fig. 6A). In agreement with previous
reports [89], a transient (for 4 days) induction of p21 led to
cellular senescence, as evident by senescent morphology
(Fig. 6 B). Rapamycin partially suppressed geroconversion
to senescent morphology; rapamycin decreased cell size
and beta-Gal-staining (Fig. 6 B). In addition, rapamycin
preserved the reversibility potential (RP) measured by
the ability to form colonies after removal of IPTG. (Note
once again: The potential to proliferate (the reversibility
potential) should not be confused with proliferation. Thus,
rapamycin did not abrogate IPTG-induced arrest but
instead preserved the potential to proliferate, when IPTG
was washed out).
As shown in Figure S1B, PMA transiently
phosphorylated RR sites in the presence of rapamycin.
In agreement with the appearance of phospho-S6, this
treatment affected geroconversion, increasing the number
of senescent cells (morphology) and decreased RP (Fig.
6 B, C).
We next investigated induction of p-S6(S235/236)
by PMA in detail. Basal levels of phospho-S6K (T389),
phospho-S6(S235/236) and phospho-ERK1/2 were high
and, therefore, the effect of PMA was marginal (Fig. 7
A). Inhibitor of MEK U0126, inhibitor of TOR rapamycin
and inhibitor of TOR kinase Torin 1 all eliminated basal
level of phospho-S6K(T389)/ phospho-S6(S235/236).
This is in agreement with data obtained in SKBR3
cells. Impressively, none of these inhibitors prevented
the induction of phospho-S6 (S235/236) by PMA. Only
a combination of U0126 and Rapamycin prevented
induction of phospho-S6(S235/236) by PMA. These data
support the model shown in figure 4.
In HT-p21 cells, both rapamycin and U0126
suppressed geroconversion, as evidenced by preservation
of RP (Fig. 7B). Yet, rapamycin and U0126 did not
have any additive effect (Fig. 7B). This indicates that
PMA-induced phosphorylation of S6 at S235/236 sites
is not sufficient by itself to promote geroconversion.
Importantly, PMA increased geroconversion both in the
absence or presence of rapamycin (Fig. 6 C), suggesting
that mTORC1-dependent and -independent pathways are
involved in geroconversion.

cells

in normal human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells,
arrested by serum starvation (Fig. 8). In RPE cells, serum

withdrawal causes reversible quiescence, characterized by
low levels of p-S6 [26, 34]. In quiescent cells arrested by
serum starvation, PMA transiently induced phospho-S6
(Fig. 8 A). PMA did not induce proliferation but instead

induced “futile growth” or geroconversion”. This
geroconversion is manifested by hypertrophy and beta-Gal
staining in approximately 20% of cells, observed after readdition of serum (Fig. 8 B).

DISCUSSION

the MEK pathway. Either MEK or mTOR was sufficient
to phosphorylate these sites of S6K and S6. Thus, neither
rapamycin nor U0126 inhibited phosphorylation of S6K
and S6 at T421/S424 and S235/236, respectively, whereas
a combination of U0126 and rapamycin eliminated
phosphorylation of S6K and S6 on these sites. Yet (and
importantly), the addition of U0126 to rapamycin had no
effect on geroconversion. This indicates that rapamycininsensitive phosphorylation of these sites alone is not
sufficient to cause geroconversion, when mTORC1 is
inhibited. In turn, this indicates that, although rapamycin
sensitive-pathways are involved in geroconversion,
some unidentified rapamycin-insensitive pathways also
contribute to geroconversion. So identification of such
pathways remains a challenge.
In conclusion, PMA possesses two senescencepromoting activities: cell cycle arrest (in some cell lines
such as SKBR3) and geroconversion. When the cell cycle
is arrested by other condition (IPTG-induced p21 or serum
starvation), then the geroconverting activity of PMA
becomes apparent.
This study further validates the utility of two-step
model of senescence for identification of agents which can
promote or in contrast suppress aging.

Growth-promoting pathways such as the PI-3K/
mTOR pathway are involved in both cancer and aging
[21, 64, 90, 91]. Rapamycin prevents age-related diseases
and cancer in mammals, including humans [92-116].
Therefore, inhibitors of mTOR are both tumor suppressors
and gero-suppressors. To study aging in accelerated
fashion, it would be useful to identify “antipode for
rapamycin”, an agent that promotes geroconversion.
Such agent is expected to (a) activate mTOR and related
pathway, (b) be a tumor-promoter. It is known that PMA,
a classic tumor-promoter, activates mTOR and MAPK
pathways. Importantly, rapamycin can suppress tumorpromotion caused by PMA [117-119].
Given that PMA activates the mTOR pathway, we
predicted that PMA can accelerate geroconversion in
cell culture. Here we showed that phorbol ester indeed
displayed the gero-converting activity. This activity can
be obscured by the ability of PMA to initiate senescence,
simply by inducing cell cycle arrest. In SKBR3 cells,
strong activation of MEK/ERK pathway by PMA causes
induction of p21 and cell cycle arrest. When the cell
cycle was arrested, still active mTOR pathway drove
geroconversion from arrest to senescence. So in SKBR3
cells, PMA caused cell cycle arrest, which was sufficient to
cause senescence in the presence of active mTOR. This is
consistent with the model of two-step senescence program:
cell cycle arrest by PMA plus geroconversion by active
mTOR. The mTOR pathway was constitutively activated
in cancer SKBR3 cells even in the absence of serum.
Rapamycin decreased geroconversion, indicating that
mTOR indeed is involved in PMA-induced senescence.
To elucidate the role of PMA in geroconversion,
we used the model of IPTG-induced senescence, HT-p21
cells. In this model IPTG, not PMA, caused p21 induction
and cell cycle arrest. PMA increased senescence in this
cell model, acting as an enhancer of geroconversion.
Rapamycin partially decreased geroconversion in the
presence and absence of PMA. Yet, PMA still enhanced
geroconversion in the presence and absence of rapamycin.
This indicates that geroconversion involves some
rapamycin-insensitive pathways (in addition to rapamycinsensitive pathways), which are activated by PMA and are
involved in geroconversion. Noteworthy, rapamycininsensitive phosphorylation of S6K(T421/S424) and
S6(S235/236) was also mTOR -independent because Torin
1 (a direct inhibitor of both mTORC1 and mTORC2)
did not abrogate-rapamycin insensitive phosphorylation
of S6(S235/236) and S6K(T421/S424). We identified
pathways that led to rapamycin-insensitive S6K(T421/
S424) phosphorylation by PMA (Fig. 4). In agreement
with previous reports, PMA induced phosphorylation of
S6K and S6 at both rapamycin-sensitive and -insensitive
sites in all 3 cell lines tested here. In part, PMA-induced
rapamycin-insensitive phosphorylation was dependent on
