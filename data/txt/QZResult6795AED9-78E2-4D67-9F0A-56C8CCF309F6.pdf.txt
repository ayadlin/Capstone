ABSTRACT
Platinum compounds such as cisplatin and carboplatin are frequently used
as the first-line chemotherapy for the treatment of the head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In the present study, we investigated whether garcinol, a
polyisoprenylated benzophenone can chemosensitize HNSCC to cisplatin. We found
that garcinol inhibited the viability of a panel of diverse HNSCC cell lines, enhanced the
apoptotic effect of cisplatin, suppressed constitutive as well as cisplatin-induced NFκB activation, and downregulated the expression of various oncogenic gene products
(cyclin D1, Bcl-2, survivin and VEGF). In vivo study showed that administration of
garcinol alone (0.5 mg/kg body weight, i.p. five times/week) significantly suppressed
the growth of the tumor, and this effect was further increased by cisplatin. Both
the markers of proliferation index (Ki-67) and microvessel density (CD31) were
downregulated in tumor tissues by the combination of cisplatin and garcinol. The
pharmacokinetic results of garcinol indicated that good systemic exposure was
achievable after i.p. administration of garcinol at 0.5 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg with mean
peak concentration (Cmax) of 1825.4 and 6635.7 nM in the mouse serum, respectively.
Overall, our results suggest that garcinol can indeed potentiate the effects of cisplatin
by negative regulation of various inflammatory and proliferative biomarkers.

INTRODUCTION

extracted from the dried rind of the fruit of Garcinia
indica tree which is used as a traditional folk medicine for
the treatment of diseases as diverse as rheumatism, edema,
ulcer and infectious diseases [29]. Along with its antioxidative, anti-microbial, and anti-inflammatory activities
[30–32], anti-neoplastic and chemopreventive roles of
garcinol have been identified in variety of cancer cell
lines and in vivo cancer models, such as leukemia [33],
colon cancer [34], breast cancer [35] and oral cancer [36].
Although the mechanisms of garcinol’s anti-cancer effects
are not fully understood, number of signaling transduction
pathways, enzymes and receptors have been implicated to
be modulated by garcinol, including FAK [34], NF-κB
[35], HAT [37], STAT3 [38, 39] and death receptors [40].
Although garcinol has been previously reported to
potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer
[40], there are no prior reports indicating the potential of
garcinol as a chemosensitizing agent in HNSCC mouse
models. Thus, in the present study, we analyzed whether
garcinol could sensitize human HNSCC to cisplatin in vitro
and in a xenograft mouse model. Our results indicate for
the first time that garcinol can indeed inhibit the viability
of various HNSCC cell lines, enhance cisplatin-induced
apoptosis, and potentiate the anti-tumor activity of cisplatin
in a human xenograft HNSCC mouse model through the
abrogation of NF-ĸB activation and down-modulation of
expression of NF-ĸB-regulated gene products.

Despite advances in earlier detection and novel
therapies for HNSCC, it still remains a major health
concern and causes more than 350,000 deaths annually
worldwide [1]. Multidisciplinary approaches involving
surgical excision, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy
are frequently used for the treatment of HNSCC, but
have shown limited efficacy due to tumor recurrence,
drug resistance, and distant metastases in locoregionally
advanced disease [2]. The chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin
(cis-dichloro-diammineplatinum (II)) has been approved
by FDA for the treatment of HNSCC since 1970s, and
still remains as the standard and first-line chemotherapy
for HNSCC treatment although many other agents have
also been subsequently developed [3, 4]. A meta-analysis
of a panel of clinical studies has revealed that platinum
containing regimens commonly exhibit higher response
rates than non-platinum therapies [5]. Unfortunately, only
20 to 40% of the patients experience complete response
to platinating agents, mainly because of the development
of intrinsic or acquired resistance to chemotherapy [6].
High doses of platinating agents which are required for
significant anti-tumor effect frequently lead to severe side
effects such as nausea, vomiting, mucositis, neurotoxicity,
and renal dysfunction that compromise the quality of
life of the patients [7, 8]. For the above reasons, novel
pharmacological agents with lower toxicity which can
enhance the effects of existing drugs are in great need.
Several studies have previously documented the
prevalence of constitutive activated NF-κB in diverse
HNSCC cell lines and tumor tissues specimens [9–12],
and this dysregulated NF-κB signaling contributes to the
cell survival, angiogenesis, migration, tumorigenesis,
and therapeutic resistance of HNSCC [13–15]. Global
gene profiling analysis has also clearly indicated that
NF-κB signaling is a major contributor to metastatic
progression of HNSCC [16] and a prognostic biomarker
of a high-risk disease [17]. Elevated phosphorylation
level of NF-κB in patient samples is often associated
with poor prognosis in terms of high recurrence and poor
survival [18]. Additional studies have shown that several
chemotherapeutic agents including platinum compounds
can induce NF-κB activation signaling through diverse
molecular mechanism(s) in various tumor cell types
including HNSCC [19–24]. For example, cisplatin has
been shown to significantly induce NF-κB promoter
activity, accompanied with the increase in nuclear p65
and p50 protein levels in various HNSCC cell lines
[25]. However, the exact pathological role of NF-κB in
chemoresistance still remains controversial [26].
Natural products derived from traditional Chinese
medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda practiced in India are
gaining increasing importance for the treatment of
various cancers in recent years [27, 28]. Garcinol, a polyisoprenylated benzophenone, is one such compound

RESULTS
The major goal of this study was to investigate
whether garcinol can significantly enhance the anti-cancer
effect of chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin in HNSCC and
if so, through what molecular mechanism(s).

Garcinol inhibits the viability and potentiates
the apoptotic effect of cisplatin in HNSCC cells in vitro
First, the anti-proliferative potential of garcinol was
assessed on a panel of diverse HNSCC cell lines. Garcinol
inhibited the growth of all three HNSCC cell lines tested
(UMSCC1, CAL27 and MDA686LN) in a time- and dosedependent manner (Figure 1A). The IC50 values at 72 h
for HNSCC cell lines are as follows: UMSCC1: 11.6 μM;
CAL27: 14.7 μM and MDA686LN: 13.8 μM respectively.
Our further analysis of cell viability by MTT assay showed
that the combination of garcinol with cisplatin could produce
enhanced growth inhibitory effect than either agent used
alone (Figure S1A). Interestingly, the combination effects
were also found to be synergistic, as assessed by ChouTalalay method using CompuSyn software (Figure S1B).
Next, we investigated whether garcinol can itself induce
apoptosis and also potentiate the effect of cisplatin against
these cell lines using flow cytometric analysis. Combination
of garcinol (15 μM) and cisplatin (5 μM) produced significant
apoptosis in all three cell lines, as evidenced by the increase

(1 × 104 cells/well) were treated with 0, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 50 μM of garcinol for 24, 48, and 72 h and then subjected to MTT assay. (B) Garcinol
augments the cisplatin-induced apoptosis in HNSCC. UMSCC1, CAL27, and MDA686LN cells (5 × 105 cells/mL) were treated with 15 μM

analysis. (C) Garcinol enhances the cisplatin-induced activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP. UMSCC1, CAL27, and MDA686LN
cells (5 × 105 cells/mL) were treated with 15 μM garcinol and/or 5 μM cisplatin for 48 h, whole-cell extracts were prepared, separated by
SDS-PAGE, and subjected to western blot against caspase-3 and PARP antibodies. The same blots were stripped and reprobed with β-actin
antibody to verify equal protein loading. (D) Garcinol enhances the cisplatin-induced caspase-3/7 activity. CAL27 cells (1 × 104 cells/well) in
triplicates were treated with 15 μM garcinol and/or 5 μM cisplatin for 48 h in 96-well plates. Enzymatic activity of caspase-3/7 was determined
by Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay kit. The data is expressed as mean ± SD, compared with the untreated control, (*p < 0.05).

in sub-G1 population, while either agent alone only induced
minor apoptotic cell death (Figure 1B). Furthermore,
co-treatment of garcinol and cisplatin substantially activated
caspase-3 and caused PARP cleavage, as compared to
single agent alone (Figure 1C). The enhanced activation
of caspase-3 induced by the co-treatment was further
verified using quantitative Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay kit,
and the results indicated that the co-treatment of garcinol
and cisplatin significantly increased caspase3/7 activity in
CAL27 cells (Figure 1D). To evaluate the role of caspase-3
activation in the garcinol-induced apoptosis, the pan-caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (20 μM) was added to HNSCC
cells together with both the drugs for 48 h. As shown in
(Figure S2), Z-VAD-fmk treatment completely blocked the
increased PARP cleavage, indicating the involvement of
caspase-3 in enhancement of apoptosis caused by garcinol.
Overall, our results suggest that garcinol can indeed potentiate
the apoptotic effects of cisplatin in various HNSCC cells.

western blot and real-time PCR analyses. The data showed
that garcinol indeed downregulated the expression of
proliferative (cyclin D1), anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, survivin),
and angiogenic (VEGF) proteins in a time-dependent
manner in UMSCC1 cells (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
we found that garcinol also attenuated the expression
of cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and survivin genes at transcription
level (Figure 3C). And the suppression of NF-κBregulated anti-apoptotic gene products correlated to the
activation of caspase-3 together with the PARP cleavage
(Figure 3B).We next also examined the effect of garcinol
on the expression of various cisplatin-induced oncogenic
proteins in HNSCC cells. We noted that the expression
of MMP-9, ICAM-1 and COX-2 increased after cisplatin
exposure in a time-dependent manner (Figure 3D), and
garcinol treatment was also able to substantially downmodulate cisplatin-induced expression of these oncogenic
molecules in HNSCC cells (Figure 3E).

Garcinol suppresses both constitutive and cisplatininduced NF-κB activation in HNSCC cells

Garcinol significantly potentiates the anti-tumor
effects of cisplatin in HNSCC xenograft model

Next, we explored in detail how garcinol can potentiate
the apoptotic effect of cisplatin in HNSCC cell lines.
Aberrant NF-κB activation has been shown to contribute
to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance in HNSCC
[14, 16, 41]. We conducted western blot and NF-κB DNA
binding assay to examine whether garcinol can suppress
constitutive NF-κB activation in HNSCC cells. We found
that garcinol treatment indeed caused the downregulation
of constitutive NF-κB expression in a dose- and timedependent manner (Figure 2A and 2B) and suppression of
constitutive phospho-IκBα expression (Figure 2C) as well
as NF-κB DNA binding activity (Figure 2D) in HNSCC
cells. To next determine whether garcinol affects NF-κBmediated gene transcription, HNSCC cells were transiently
transfected with a plasmid containing NF-κB-regulated
luciferase reporter construct, and then incubated with
garcinol. Our results indicated that garcinol can significantly
abrogate NF-κB-dependent reporter gene expression in a
dose-dependent manner in MDA686Tu cells (Figure 2E).
We further observed that cisplatin was indeed able to induce
NF-κB activation in MDA686LN cells (Figure 2F and 2G),
and this cisplatin-induced NF-κB activation could also be
significantly abrogated upon garcinol treatment (Figure 2H
and 2I). Overall, these data reveal that garcinol can act as a
potent suppressor of both constitutive and inducible NF-κB
activation in HNSCC cells.

Based on the aforementioned in vitro results, we
next evaluated the in vivo therapeutic potential of garcinol
and cisplatin either alone or in combination on the growth
of HNSCC CAL27 xenografts in nude mice. A schematic
overview of the experimental protocol is presented in
(Figure 4A). CAL27 cells were implanted subcutaneously
into the right flank of athymic nude mice. When tumors
have reached 0.25 cm in diameter after a week, the mice
were randomized into 4 groups and started the treatment as
per the experimental protocol. The efficacy of the treatment
was evaluated by monitoring the tumor volume during the
four week treatment. A significant decrease in the tumor
volume in single agent treated group was observed from
week 2 onwards until the end of the experiment, and the
combined treatment exerted more pronounced effect. The
tumor volume in the combination of garcinol and cisplatin
was significant lower (p < 0.05) than garcinol or cisplatin
alone group after week 4 (Figure 4B). Body weight of the
animals was monitored during the experiment, and no
significant loss of body weight was observed in garcinol
treated and combination groups (Figure 4C). Together,
these data indicate that garcinol can indeed enhance the
anti-tumor efficacy of cisplatin in vivo without any severe
toxicity to the animals.

garcinol and cisplatin treatment can modulate the
expression of these biomarkers to manifest their
effects against HNSCC. (Figure 5A) showed that both

showed that garcinol either alone or in combination with
cisplatin effectively suppressed the constitutive phospho-p65
and NF-κB (p65) expression in HNSCC tumor tissues
(Figure 6A). NF-κB is known to regulate the expression
of proliferative (cyclin D1, COX-2), invasive/metastatic
(MMP-9, ICAM-1) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xL, survivin)
proteins [44, 45]. Accordingly, we performed western blot
analysis to examine whether garcinol and cisplatin can
modulate the expression of these NF-κB-regulated gene
products in HNSCC tumor tissues. (Figure 6B) clearly
showed that combination treatment of garcinol and cisplatin
was very effective in downregulating the expression of
various oncogenic gene products involved in HNSCC
growth, survival, invasion, and metastasis. Furthermore, the
results of immunohistochemical analysis on human HNSCC
tumor samples demonstrated that garcinol in combination
with cisplatin significantly suppressed NF-κB (p65),
COX-2, VEGF, and MMP-9, and such downregulation
was more impressive than either garcinol or cisplatin alone
(Figure 7A). The immunohistochemical analysis results
further support the observation of western blot analysis.
Taken together, our data indicate that garcinol suppresses
constitutive NF-κB activation thereby attenuating the
expression of genes involved in proliferation, survival,
invasion, and angiogenesis in vivo.

both constitutive and inducible NF-κB activation and
further suppressed the expression of NF-κB-regulated
gene products. Furthermore, we observed that garcinol
can effectively suppress the tumor growth alone and in
combination with cisplatin in a xenograft mouse model by
down-modulating various proliferative and inflammatory
biomarkers.
The anti-proliferative effects of garcinol have been
previously reported in several cancers, for example,
treatment of garcinol caused significant reduction in cell
viability in leukemia [33] and pancreatic adenocarcinoma
cells [48], and the inhibitory effects were correlated with
the DNA fragmentation and cell cycle disruption. However,
whether garcinol exhibits similar activity in HNSCC cell
lines has never been evaluated before. In our study, we
first demonstrated that garcinol inhibited the viability of
HNSCC cell lines in a time- and dose- dependent manner.
We also found that garcinol suppressed the expression of
an important cell cycle regulator cyclin D1, which may
explain its observed anti-proliferative effect in HNSCC
cells. We further report for the first time that garcinol when
used in combination with cisplatin, was highly effective
in inducing substantial apoptosis in HNSCC cell lines.
This is quite intriguing because although our group has
already recently reported that garcinol can alone induce
apoptosis in HNSCC cells [39], potential use of garcinol
in combination with existing chemotherapeutic agents like
cisplatin has never been investigated in HNSCC cells.
We hypothesize that this effect may be attributed to the
downregulation of multiple cell survival proteins such as
Bcl-2 and survivin. Interestingly, our results are in a part
agreement with recent studies, in which two curcumin
analogues (H-4073 and FLLL32) [49, 50] were reported to
enhance the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin treatment in
HNSCC through the abrogation of STAT3 signaling axis
that has also been reported by us recently to be negatively
regulated by garcinol [39].
Growing evidences have indicated that acquired
resistance to cisplatin in tumor cells is associated with
multiple molecular mechanisms [51–55], among which is
the activation of NF-κB. Prior studies reported that cisplatin
could induce NF-κB activation in different type of cancers,
which led to the drug resistance [21, 56, 57]. Interestingly,
we found that cisplatin can substantially increase nuclear p65
expression and phosphorylation level as well as NF-κB DNA
binding activity in HNSCC cells, and both the constitutive
and cisplatin-induced NF-κB activation could be suppressed
upon garcinol treatment in HNSCC cells. A recent report has
suggested that NF-κB can also mediate cisplatin-induced
resistance through histone modifications in HNSCC cells [57],
and thus inducible NF-κB inhibitory effects of garcinol may
be mediated through its previously documented potent histone
acetyltransferases blocking effects as observed in other tumor
cells [37]. Our results are also in part agreement with another
study in which curcumin was also found to enhance the effect
of cisplatin in suppression of HNSCC via inhibition of IKKβ

Pharmacokinetic profile of garcinol
The pharmacokinetic profile of garcinol at doses of
0.5 and 2 mg/kg are presented in (Figure 7B). Each point
represents a mean value of three serum concentrations.
After i.p. administration, garcinol was quickly absorbed
into the bloodstream and reached a peak serum
concentration (Cmax) of 1825.4 and 6635.7 nM at 0.5 h
post-dose for dose of 0.5 and 2 mg/kg, respectively. In
addition, the area under the serum concentration-time
curve (AUC) at 8 h is increased proportionally from
4298.3 to 16944.8 h*nM.

DISCUSSION
Despite the recent advances in surgery and
radiotherapy, and development of sophisticated systemic
therapy, limited improvement in treating metastatic
HNSCC has been achieved. Two-thirds of all patients
present advanced stage III or IV tumors with low
locoregional control rates and 5-year survival rates below
50% [46, 47]. Thus, novel agents that are non-toxic,
efficacious, and can significantly enhance the effects of
existing chemotherapeutic drugs are urgently needed.
The present study was designed to explore the potential
of garcinol, a polyisoprenylated benzophenone, as a
chemosensitizing agent in combating HNSCC. We found
that garcinol inhibited the viability of various HNSCC
cells, enhanced the apoptotic effect of cisplatin in a panel
of head and neck cancer cell lines, negatively regulated

protein of the NF-κB pathway [58]. Tumor cells are known
to secrete substantial amounts of matrix metalloproteinases,
which not only degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) but also
facilitate tumor cell migration and invasion to neighboring
tissues [59]. The cellular adhesion molecule, ICAM-1 has
also been implicated in various stages of tumor progression
and metastasis [60], whereas COX-2 contributes to different
stages of cancer development including uncontrolled growth,
metastasis and angiogenesis [61, 62]. We further observed
that cisplatin also substantially induced the expression of the
MMP-9, ICAM-1 and COX-2 proteins, and garcinol treatment
was able to suppress both constitutive and cisplatin-induced
expression of above mentioned NF-κB-regulated gene
products involved in HNSCC progression.
In order to examine the efficacy of garcinol in a
xenograft mouse model, a pharmacokinetic study of garcinol
was conducted to define suitable doses for treatment of mice
in pharmacodynamics study. Two doses of garcinol (0.5
and 2 mg/kg) were used for evaluation of pharmacokinetic
property of garcinol through intraperitoneal administration.
The pharmacokinetic results indicated that garcinol
showed a sufficient systemic exposure and good dose
proportionality which is an important property for garcinol
in its translational development from animal to human
subjects. The pharmacokinetic results suggested that
0.5 and 2 mg/kg of garcinol are the suitable doses for its
pharmacodynamics evaluation. These hypotheses had been
confirmed by our xenograft mouse experiment in which
garcinol at 0.5 mg/kg dose was found to inhibit the tumor
growth effectively. We observed that garcinol or cisplatin
alone reduced tumor volume by 50%, and the combination
of the two agents augmented the effect to a significant
greater extent. We also noticed that the garcinol suppressed
the expression of both proliferative and microvessel
density biomarkers (Ki-67 and CD31) respectively. Further
analyses on tumor tissues by western and IHC showed that
garcinol downregulated the expression of critical oncogenic
molecules involved in proliferation (cyclin D1, COX-2),
survival (Bcl-xL, survivin), angiogenesis (VEGF) and
invasion (MMP-9, ICAM-1) and all of these effects were
further enhanced upon cisplatin treatment.
Garcinol has been previously tested in pancreatic
cancer and breast cancer, in conjunction with other anticancer agents namely gemcitabine, curcumin and antiERBB2 antibody [63–65]. There are also prior animal
studies on garcinol as chemopreventive agent against
nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced tongue cancer in
rats [36] and 7, 12-dimethylbenz [a] anthracene (DMBA)induced oral cancer in hamster cheek pouch [66]. However,
the effects of garcinol in combination with anti-cancer
therapies in HNSCC mouse models have never been studied
before. Our results indicate for the first time that garcinol
indeed exerts its chemosensitizing effects in HNSCC by
down-modulating the activation of NF-κB and various
proliferative and inflammatory biomarkers both in vitro
and in vivo. Overall, based on our novel findings, well
designed clinical trials are needed to analyze the therapeutic

efficacy of garcinol either alone or in combination with
chemotherapy in HNSCC patients.

provided to us by Prof. Thomas E. Carey (University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) and has been characterized
previously. MDA686LN and MDA686Tu cells were kindly
provided by Prof. Jeffrey N. Myers (The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas) and has been
characterized previously. CAL27 was purchased in the year
2009 from American Type Culture Collection. UMSCC1
and CAL27 were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin, MDA686LN and MDA686Tu cells were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL
penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin,1 × NEAA, 1 × sodium
pyruvate, 1 × vitamin and 2 mM glutamine.

Western blotting
Vehicle or drug-treated whole-cell extracts were lysed in
lysis buffer [250 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM EDTA (pH
8.0), 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 μg/mL aprotinin,

1.5 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethyl­sulfonylfluoride
(PMSF), and 1.5 mM NaVO4]. Lysates were then spun at
13,300 rpm for 10 min to remove insoluble material and
resolved on a 10% SDS gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins
were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad), blocked with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.), and
probed with antibodies of interest overnight at 4ºC. The blot
was washed with TBS with 0.1% Tween-20, exposed to HRPconjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h, and finally examined
by chemiluminescence using Western Bright Sirius HRP
substrate (Advansta).

lipofectamine® 2000. After transfection for 48 h, indicated
concentrations of garcinol were added into the wells for 12
h. Luciferase activity was determined using Bright-Glo™
luciferase assay kit from Promega.

RNA extraction and real time PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent
(Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Reverse transcription was then carried
out as described previously [67]. For a 50 μL reaction,
10 μL of RT product was mixed with 1 × Taq-Man®
Universal PCR Master mix, 2.5 μL of 20 × TaqMan
probes for cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and survivin, respectively,
2.5 μL of 20 × 18S RNA TaqMan probe as the
endogenous control for each targeting gene and topped
up to 50 μL with sterile water. A negative control for
RT, in which sterile water replaced the RNA template,
was included. Another control, where RT mix was
replaced with sterile water, was included to check for
DNA contamination. Real time PCR was done using
the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (ABI PRISM
7500; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the
following protocol: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 10 min,
followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 15
s and extension at 60°C for 1 min. The results were
analyzed using Sequence Detection Software version
1.3 provided by Applied Biosystems. Relative gene
expression was obtained after normalization with
endogenous human 18 S and determination of the
difference in threshold cycle (Ct) between treated and
untreated cells using the 2-ΔΔCt method. Primers and
probes for human cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and survivin were
purchased as kits from Applied Biosystems (Assays-onDemand).

Cell viability assay
The inhibitory effect of garcinol against HNSCC
cell growth was determined by the MTT dye uptake
method as described previously [39]. Briefly, the cells
(5 × 104 cells/mL) were incubated in triplicate in a 96-well
plate in the presence or absence of different concentrations
of garcinol in a final volume of 0.2 mL for indicated time
intervals at 37ºC. Thereafter, 20 μL MTT solution (5 mg/mL in
PBS) was added to each well. After a 2 h incubation at 37°C,
0.1 mL lysis buffer (20% SDS, 50% dimethylformamide) was
added after removal of the medium, incubation was continued
at 37°C for 1 h, and then the optical density (OD) at 570 nm
was measured by the Safire2™ microplate reader (Tecan).

Flow cytometric analysis
To determine the effect of garcinol on the cell cycle,
HNSCC cells (5 × 105 cells/mL) were seeded in a 6-well plate
and then exposed to single agent or combination of garcinol
and cisplatin for 48 h. Thereafter, cells were trypsinized,
washed with PBS, and fixed with 70% ethanol for 30 min
on ice. Cells were then washed again, resuspended, and
stained in PBS containing 10 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI)
and 1 μg/mL RNase A for 30 min at room temperature. Cell
distribution across the cell cycle was analyzed with a CyAn
ADP flow cytometer (Dako Cytomation).

HNSCC xenograft mouse model
All procedures involving animals were reviewed
and approved by NUS Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. Six-week old athymic nu/nu female mice
(Animal Resource Centre, Australia) were implanted
subcutaneously in the right flank with CAL27 cells (3 × 106
cells/100 μL saline). When tumors have reached 0.25 cm
in diameter, the mice were randomized into the following
treatment groups (n =5/group): (I) untreated control (0.1%
DMSO, 100 μL daily); (II) garcinol (0.5 mg/kg body weight,
suspended in 0.1% DMSO, intraperitoneal [i.p.] injection,
five times/week); (III) cisplatin alone (2 mg/kg body weight,
suspended in 0.1% DMSO, i.p. injection, twice/week);
and (IV) combination (garcinol, 0.5 mg/kg body weight,
i.p. injection, five times/week and cisplatin, 2 mg/kg body
weight, i.p. injection, twice/week). Therapy was continued
for 4 weeks, and the animals were euthanized 24 h after the
last dose. Primary tumors were excised and the final tumor
volume was calculated using the formula V = L × (W)2/2
where L is the length and W is the width. Half of the tumor

Caspase-Glo® 3/7 luminescent assay
Caspase activity was measured using Caspase-Glo®
3/7 assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. HNSCC cells (1 × 104 cells/well) in 96-well
plate were treated with single agent or combination of
garcinol and cisplatin as indicated for 48 h. Equal volume
of Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Reagent was then added to the wells
to provide the 1:1 ratio of reagent volume to sample
volume. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the
luminescence was measured by Tecan microplate reader.

NF-κB luciferase reporter assay
MDA686Tu cells (1 × 104 cells/well) in 96-well
were transfected of plasmid with NF-κB responsive
plate elements linked to a luciferase reporter gene using

tissue was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for
immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. The other half was
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.

To determine NF-κB activation, we conducted DNAbinding assay using TransAM NF-κB Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described [39].
Briefly, 20 μg of nuclear proteins were added into a 96-well
plate coated with an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the
consensus binding site for NF-κB (5’-GGGACTTTCC-3’)
and incubated for 1 h. The wells were washed and incubated
with antibodies against NF-κB p65 subunit for 1 h. An
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody was then applied to
detect the bound primary antibody and it provided the basis
for colorimetric quantification. The enzymatic product was
measured at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 655 nm
by microplate reader.

Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor samples
Solid tumors from control and drug-treated groups
were fixed with 10% phosphate buffered formalin, processed,
and embedded in paraffin. The sections were cut and
deparafinized in xylene, dehydrated in graded alcohol, and
finally hydrated in water. Antigen retrieval was conducted
by boiling the slide in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) for
30 min. Immunohistochemistry was conducted following
the manufacturer’s instructions (Dako LSAB Kit). Briefly,
endogenous peroxidases were quenched with 3% hydrogen
peroxide. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation in
the blocking reagent in the LSAB Kit. Sections were incubated
overnight with primary antibodies as follows: anti-Ki-67, antiCD31, anti-COX-2, anti-MMP-9, anti-p65, and anti-VEGF
(each at 1:100 dilutions). The slides were subsequently
washed in TBS-T and were incubated with biotinylated
linker for 30 min, followed by incubation with streptavidin
conjugate. Immunoreactive species were detected using
3,30’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as a substrate.
The sections were counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin
and mounted under glass cover slips. Images were taken
using an Olympus BX51 microscope (magnification, × 40).
Quantitative analysis of immunohistochemistry images were
done by visual scores between the control and treated images.
In this expression quantitation technique, each image is
divided into four parts and each part is individually quantitated
for the biomarker expression. A cell scored as positive refers
simply to the presence of brown staining (peroxidase) in any
part of the studied tissue. A negative cell scored refers to no
staining or weak staining.

Pharmacokinetics study of garcinol in mice
Pharmacokinetics of garcinol was conducted in nude
mice by i.p. injection at dose of 0.5 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg.
The mice were allowed food and water ad libitum before
pharmacokinetics experiment. About 150 μL of blood was
taken from facial vein of mice at 10 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 6,
and 8 h post-dose. After centrifugation of blood samples at
14,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min, mouse sera (the supernatant)
were transferred into Eppendorf tube. 10 μL of each serum
was processed by adding 3-folds excess of acetonitrilecontaining isogarcinol, the internal standard followed by
vortexing for 1 min. The tube was then centrifuged at 14,000
rpm at 4°C for 10 min. Then 30 μL of the supernatants
were transferred into glass inserts (250 μL) with 70 μL
of 10 mM ammonia acetate solution. 50 μL of processed
serum samples were injected into LC-MS/MS which was
carried out under negative electrospray ionization (ESI) and
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Mass spectra
of garcinol and its internal standard, isogarcinol showed a
same precursor ion [M–H] - at m/z of 601. The daughter ion
monitored for garcinol and isogarcinol was 409 and 335,
respectively. SCIEX Analyst software (version 1.4.2) was
used for data acquisition and analysis.

Preparation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extract
Nuclear proteins were extracted from cell lines
using TransAM Nuclear Extract Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were washed
with phosphatase inhibitors-containing PBS and collected
by scraping. After centrifugation at 500 rpm for 5 min,
the supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was
resuspended with 1 × hypotonic buffer, after which was
incubated on ice for 15 min. Detergent was added to the
suspension and vortexed at highest setting for 10 seconds.
Supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was collected after
centrifugation and stored at -80ºC. The nuclear pellet was
resuspended in complete lysis buffer by pipetting up and
down several times. After vortexing for 10 seconds, the
suspension was incubated for 30 min on ice on a rocking
platform set at 150 rpm. Suspension was then vortexed
again for 30 seconds and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10
min. Supernatant (nuclear fraction) was collected and
stored at -80°C until ready to use.
