Abstract
There is a great need for the development of novel chemotherapeutic agents that overcome the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer. We catalogued the National Cancer
Institute's DTP drug repository in search of compounds showing increased toxicity in MDR cells. By comparing the sensitivity of parental cell lines with MDR derivatives, we identified 22
compounds possessing MDR-selective activity. Analysis of
structural congeners led to the identification of 15 additional
drugs showing increased toxicity in Pgp-expressing cells. Analysis of MDR-selective compounds led to the formulation of
structure activity relationships and pharmacophore models.
This data mining coupled with experimental data points to a
possible mechanism of action linked to metal chelation. Taken
together, the discovery of the MDR-selective compound set
shows the robustness of the developing field of MDR-targeting
therapy as a new strategy for resolving Pgp-mediated MDR.

Introduction
Members of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily are widely recognized as major contributors to controlling
drug distribution and pharmacokinetics, and the acquisition of
anticancer drug resistance. Expressed largely in the plasma
membranes of cancer cells, ABC transporters mediate cellular
resistance to anticancer agents by the ATP-dependent efflux of
toxic chemotherapeutics from cells. Although several ABC transporters have been shown to transport anticancer drugs in vitro,
P-glycoprotein (Pgp/MDR1/ABCB1) stands out by conferring
the highest level of resistance to a vast array of drugs and because
of its shown association with clinical multidrug resistance (MDR)
and poor clinical outcome (1). Pgp transports large, hydrophobic,
positively charged molecules that can have strikingly dissimilar
structures, including clinically relevant compounds such as
anticancer drugs, HIV-protease inhibitors, immunosuppressive
agents, and antiepileptics (1–3). Despite promising in vitro results
obtained with several generations of Pgp inhibitors, successful
modulation of clinical MDR through the chemical blockade of drug
efflux from cancer cells has not been successful (1), and new
strategies are required.

Intriguingly, Pgp can contribute not only to acquired resistance
but also to paradoxical drug sensitivity (4–14). “Collateral sensitivity” of otherwise MDR cells represents a promising but yet unrealized
strategy for targeting Pgp-mediated MDR. Given the importance of
drug-transporter interactions and the desire to uncover compound
classes with new modalities, we recently analyzed the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) drug activity data set, and reported
the prediction and validation of small molecules recognized by various ABC transporters (7). The drug database compiled by the DTP
of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) contains the cytotoxicity profiles of >100,000 compounds across 60 human cancer cell lines (NCI60 panel). This data set, combined with other descriptors of the cell
panel, provides clues to mechanisms of chemosensitivity and resistance (7, 15, 16). Statistical correlations between the sensitivity of
these cell lines to a panel of anticancer drugs and the expression
of Pgp across the NCI-60 cell panel identified new Pgp substrates,
but also suggested that cells expressing higher levels of Pgp are more
sensitive to the thiosemicarbazone NSC73306. This agent was selected for in vitro evaluation (17), and we have subsequently shown that
NSC73306 is truly selective for functional Pgp; cells are hypersensitive to NSC73306 in proportion to their Pgp function, and this selectivity is abrogated by functional inhibition of Pgp or downregulation
of Pgp expression by siRNA (18). Furthermore, NSC73306 itself is not
an inhibitor or substrate of Pgp, suggesting that this compound does
not confer its toxicity in the same fashion as the so-called “collateral
sensitivity” agents.
We are currently undertaking preclinical assessment of NSC73306.
In parallel, we sought to identify new “MDR-selective” compounds to
expand the scope of bioactive agents and to gain insight into the
Pgp-specific mechanism of action. To this end, here, we report the
screening of 42,000 compounds from the DTP data set in silico for
MDR-selective activity, predicted by the correlation of cytotoxicity
with Pgp expression across the NCI-60 cell line panel. This prediction
set was then validated in vitro, focusing on clusters of structurally
related compounds. Twenty-two compounds possessing MDR-selective activity were identified and analysis of structural congeners
in the DTP repository led to the identification of 15 additional
compounds showing increased toxicity in Pgp-expressing cells. The
discovery of these MDR-selective compounds shows the robustness
of the developing field of MDR-targeting therapy as a new strategy for
resolving Pgp-mediated MDR.

NOTE: Compounds identified as having MDR-selective activity, listed with their Pearson's correlation coefficients—the correlation between Pgp
expression and DTP determined efficacy of each compound across the NCI-60 cell line panel. To validate predicted MDR-selective activity in vitro,
compounds were sourced by a variety of methods, predominantly through the NCI DTP drug library, but also via other investigators and synthesis in
our laboratories. For compounds that were available, IC50 values were determined using the MTT cytotoxicity assay on the parental KB-3-1 cell line,
and its P-glycoprotein–expressing derivative, KB-V1. Those unavailable for testing are noted as such (NA). MDR1 selectivity is calculated as the ratio of
a compound's IC50 against KB-3-1 cells divided by its IC50 against KB-V1 cells. A value of >1 indicates that the compound kills Pgp-expressing cells
more effectively than parental cells—so-called MDR-selective activity (bolded), as assessed by two-sided paired Student's t test of multiple MTT assays.
Compounds with a ratio of ≤1 inhibit growth in both cell lines with similar potency (0.5<r≤1), indicating that they are either Pgp substrates or their
toxicity is not modulated by Pgp. Compounds with an IC50 of >50 μmol/L were considered to be inactive (not toxic, NT), and as such their MDR1
selectivity could not be determined.

Drug database. The DTP Human Tumor Cell Line Screen has screened
tens of thousands of compounds for growth inhibition of human cancer cell
lines. Publicly available screening results of ∼43,000 compounds were
downloaded from the DTP Web site5 (July 2007 Release). Scrutiny of the
data set indicated that it was not immediately amenable to stringent statistical analysis due to missing dose-response values or lack of activity in
the dose window tested (12.1% of the cell line screen data points are missing and 44.9% of growth inhibition values indicate inactivity; ref. 20). Because uninformative drug profiles are not expected to yield useful leads, we
analyzed only those drugs that were measured inside the range of cytotoxicity with no >50% missing values, resulting in a higher quality data set.
Putative MDR-selective compounds were identified based on correlation
of their cytotoxicity patterns to ABCB1 expression, as described by Szakacs
and colleagues (7).

by doxorubicin selection (23). KB-3-1, KB-V1, NIH3T3, and NIH-MDRG185 cells were grown in DMEM cell culture medium at 37°C in 5% CO2.
MES-SA and MES-SA Dx5 cells were grown in McCoy's medium. NIH-MDRG185, KB-V-1, and Dx5 cells were maintained in 60 ng/mL colchicine,
1 μg/mL vinblastine, and 500 nmol/L doxorubicin (Adriamycin), respectively, to maintain Pgp expression. All cell culture media (Life Technologies)
was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies),
5 mmol/L glutamine (Life Technologies), and 50 unit/mL penicillin and
streptomycin (Life Technologies). Retroviral expression of ABCB1 in A431

Results
Correlative information from the NCI-60 screen identifies
putative MDR-selective compounds that are more active in
cells that overexpress Pgp. In an effort to identify candidate
MDR-selective compounds, we used quantitative real-time PCR

expression data (7) to correlate Pgp mRNA levels and the publicly
available DTP drug screening toxicity profiles across the NCI-60
panel. Our analysis included DTP's complete public data set, consisting of 42,657 candidate anticancer agents that had been submitted
for screening. Dose-response data of the compounds screened
against the NCI60 cell panel were downloaded from DTP's Web site
(July 2007 release) and curated to remove uninformative doseresponse profiles.

97.4% of drug-Pgp correlations fall within the range −0.4 < r < 0.4,
considered to accommodate compounds with poor or no correlation with Pgp expression, indicating that for most drugs Pgp is not
a key determinant of toxicity. Although the analysis identified several putative substrates at r < −0.4, we focused on the positively
correlated Pgp-drug correlations (r ≥ 0.4). Data conditioning reduced the 42K set to 64 compounds (“Discovery set”) showing a
strong positive correlation (r ≥ 0.4) between Pgp expression and
efficacy patterns across the NCI-60 cell line panel (Supplementary
Table S1; Table 1). Based on our earlier validation of the bioinformatic correlation used here, we hypothesized that these compounds would likely possess MDR-selective activity. Indeed,
NSC73306, reported previously by us as an MDR-selective agent,
was again identified in this screen (Table 1; ref. 7).
To characterize the structural coherence of the Discovery set,
the 64 compounds were clustered based on commonality in their
structural features (chemical descriptors), revealing distinct Tanimoto clustering (Fig. 1). Strikingly, 9 of the 64 compounds contain
a thiosemicarbazone functional group and 5 of these are isatin-βthiosemicarbazones: NSC73306, NSC716765, NSC716766,

NOTE: MDR1 selectivity of NSC10580, NSC168468, NSC292408, and
NSC713048 comparing parental (KB-3-1, NIH-3T3, MES-SA, and
A431) and their respective Pgp-expressing derivatives (KB-V1, G185,
MES-SA Dx5, and A431 B1) were determined by MTT cytotoxicity assays. For KB-V1, cytotoxicity was also assayed in the presence and
absence of the Pgp inhibitor PSC833 (2 μmol/L), to determine whether functional Pgp is required for MDR-selective activity.

NSC716768, NSC716772, NSC669341, NSC693336, NSC695331, and
NSC695333 (isatin-β-thiosemicarbazones in italics). This suggests
that the isatin-β-thiosemicarbazone core of NSC73306, the only
MDR-selective agent reported in the DTP drug database thus far,
is strongly associated with MDR-selective activity. Notably, the biological activity of thiosemicarbazones often involves endogenous
metal ion coordination (25, 26), and the metal chelates of thiosemicarbazones are regularly reported to be more active than the
compound alone (27). The 64 compounds also include eight metal
complexes (Fig. 1). Seven of these contain 1,10-phenanthroline
(phen) or 2,2′-bipyridine (bipy) bidentate ligands, and six contain
lanthanoid metal ions. Phen and bipy are well-characterized
chelating agents known to show antiproliferative activity (28).
Two highly similar 8-hydroxyquinoline analogues, NSC693871
and NSC693872, are also potent chelators with known antiproliferative activity (29–31).
A distinct cluster is formed by seven natural product-derived
sesquiterpenic benzoquinones based on the natural product perezone [NSC697125, 2-(1,5-dimethyl-4-hexenyl)-3-hydroxymethyl-pbenzoquinone; ref. 32]. Perezone and six closely related analogues
NSC697125 (aminoperezone), NSC697124 (isoaminoperezone),
NSC697129 (anilineperezone), NSC697120, NSC697128, NSC697137,
and NSC697135 are known to display a range of pharmacologic
properties including redox activity and mitochondrial decoupling
(33). The benzoquinone moiety of perezones responsible for redox
activity can also be found in other NSC compounds such as the
catechol of NSC10580 (34).
Beyond these three major classes (encompassing 24 of 64 compounds), a variety of structural motifs and known drug derivatives
exist, presenting a number of promising opportunities for lead drug
validation. For example, there are three podophyllotoxin (or etoposide) analogues (NSC403148, NSC651859, and NSC653864), and an
olivacine analogue (NSC86715) that was previously identified in a
screen for MDR1-related agents (35), and a recently patented Bcl-2
inhibitor (NSC168468).
Verification of MDR-selective activity in cytotoxicity assays.
The 64 compounds listed in Table 1 correlated with elevated
toxicity in proportion to Pgp expression across the NCI60 cell lines.
To validate the predicted Pgp-potentiated activity, 35 compounds
that were made available by DTP were tested using a cell line pair
not included in the NCI-60 panel. MTT cytotoxicity assays were
performed against KB-3-1, a human adenocarcinoma cell line,
and KB-V1, a MDR derivative of KB-3-1 that overexpresses
MDR1/Pgp (ref. 21; Table 1). By definition, MDR-selective compounds show selective toxicity toward cells expressing Pgp, defined
here as the ratio of a compound's IC50 against KB-3-1 and KB-V1
cells. A compound that is more toxic to KB-V1 cells yields a ratio
>1 and indicates MDR-selective activity. Of the 35 compounds
tested, 3 compounds had an IC50 of >50 μmol/L and thus were
considered non toxic. Ten of the remaining 32 compounds
that were tested inhibited growth in both cell lines with similar
potency, suggesting that Pgp does not modulate the toxicity of
these compounds.
Conversely, 22 compounds showed preferential growth inhibition in the Pgp-overexpressing KB-V1 cell line. To assess whether
the potentiation of cytotoxicity against Pgp-expressing cells is
robust and not cell line specific, four compounds that were available in sufficient quantities were tested on additional MDR cell
lines. Irrespective of the selecting drug used to maintain Pgp
expression, the tissue of origin, and in otherwise isogenic, Pgptransfected cell lines, all four compounds showed elevated toxicity

in Pgp-expressing cells relative to their parental line, demonstrating that the MDR-selective activity is not restricted to the KB-3/
KB-V1 cell pair (Table 2). Furthermore, PSC833, a high affinity
Pgp-inhibitor, was used to establish the requirement for functional
Pgp to mediate sensitization in KB-V1 cells (Table 2). For each
drug, inhibition of Pgp rendered the MDR cells less sensitive to
the compounds, confirming that functional Pgp is required for
the increased toxicity of the identified MDR-selective agents. This
activity profile is shared by NSC73306 (18), and shows that the
MDR1-selective activity of NSC73306 is not unique, but represents
a robust modality for targeting MDR.
Effect of structural diversification on MDR-selective
activity. We searched the DTP database for structural analogues
of the confirmed MDR-selective compounds NSC10580, NSC168468,
NSC292408, NSC713048 (Table 2), and NSC73306 (18). It was
hypothesized that some of the close structural analogues of the five
MDR-selective compounds used as seeds would show increased
toxicity in KB-V1 cells. For each lead, structurally related compounds were identified based on respective Tanimoto coefficients,
with a threshold distance of 0.6 (Supplementary Table S2). The
similarity search identified 77 analogues, of which 58 were available
for testing. Of these, MTT assays identified 15 additional compounds that were more toxic to Pgp-expressing KB-V1 cells
(Supplementary Table S2).

www.aacrjournals.org

In total, the approach of analyzing the correlation between
gene expression and drug activity combined with structural similarity analysis yielded 37 MDR-selective agents. This set contains
several structurally coherent subgroups, which were further analyzed for structure activity relationships. To identify common features that may be responsible for MDR-selective activity, we
generated pharmacophore models for two prominent clusters,
containing the thiosemicarbazones and the 10580 analogues
(Supplementary Fig. S1), using the most active compounds as
templates (NSC693871 and NSC337743 for the TSC and 10580
clusters, respectively). Both models contain at least two hydrogen
bond acceptors, a hydrogen bond donor as well as an aromatic
ring (Supplementary Fig. S1). QSAR analysis of the thiosemicarbazones and analogues of NSC168468 identified descriptors that
predict MDR1-selective activity with very high accuracy [r2 =
0.98 and r2 = 0.85, respectively (see Supplementary Fig. S2 and
Supplementary Table S3 for details)]. Given the low number of
compounds tested, these predictions are preliminary and further
refinement and testing of the model is currently under way with
synthetic libraries.
The role of metal binding in MDR-selective activity. Most
compounds identified here are poorly characterized—28 of the
64 putative MDR-selective compounds do not appear in any
peer-reviewed publication (SciFinder 2008 structure-search). The

NOTE: Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of NSC73306
(L, mw = 326.1 gmol−1), and mixtures with metal ions (+II oxidation
state) in 1:1 methanol/H2O. The highest mass peak observed is shown,
in each case corresponding to a 2:1 ligand/metal complex.

NCI-60 screening data represent a unique, publicly available, information-rich source that has the potential to interface screening profiles with gene expression data and structural analysis, and to assign
a putative mechanism of action to compounds (36). Self-organizing
maps provide a visually compelling clustering algorithm to analyze
the relation of drug activity patterns to functional categories
representing distinct modes of action (37). To find out if the
MDR-selective compounds are associated with a common mechanism of action, the Discovery set was projected on a self-organizing
map representing cytotoxicity measurements of the DTP tumor cell
screen.6 Most of the confirmed MDR-selective compounds project
to a distinct region populated by metal chelation complexes and
chelators whose activity is linked to nucleic acid metabolism
(31, 37). A particularly strong cluster, suggestive of a shared mechanism of action, is formed by structurally diverse compounds
including NSC73306 and NSC693871 (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Along with metal-ion chelators, such as thiosemicarbazones or
the hydroxyquinolines (NSC693871 and NSC693872), the Discovery
set contains several metal complexes. The relationship between
chelating molecules and coordination complexes is inextricable;
solution equilibria results in dissociation of a complex into ligands
and metal ions, and it may be either the complex or a component
such as the liberated ligand, metal ion, or counter ion that is responsible for biological activity (38). To explore the role of the ligands and metal ions in the activity of MDR-selective compounds,
experiments were performed with free ligands and chelated complexes. First, we examined the actual metal binding capacity of
NSC73306. The two likely coordination modes of NSC73306 are
the N,S bidentate and N,S,O tridentate coordination additionally
through the ind-2-one oxygen (Fig. 2A). Addition of Fe2+, Cu2+,
and Zn2+ resulted in immediate color changes associated with rapid complexation (Fig. 2B). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of each mixture confirmed the molecular weight of NSC73306
(326.1 + H+) and revealed a 2:1 ligand/metal complex, with each
ligand singly deprotonated [M(L-H)2 + H+] indicating avid metal
binding (Table 3).
If a stable metal-bound species was responsible for the
enhanced activity of NSC73306, its preformed complexes should
show improved activity. To address this hypothesis, metal ions
were premixed with NSC73306 and cytotoxicity of the complexes
was determined by MTT assays (metal ions alone were not toxic).
The Cu-TSC complex, which is not stable in the reducing

environment of the cell, proved significantly more toxic to both cell
lines (Table 4). However, intracellular reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+
results in the dissociation of the complex and the liberation of
NSC73306 (data not shown). Therefore, the increased toxicity of
the Cu-TSC complex in both KB-3-1 and KB-V1 cells is probably
due to the chaperoning of highly toxic Cu2+ into the cell as a complex with NSC73306. Complexation with iron lowered cytotoxicity
and slightly diminished selectivity, probably by chelation that is
relatively stable even within the cell. Zinc(II) generally forms more
stable complexes than iron(II) (in accordance with the IrvingWilliams series), yet zinc coordination did not influence MDRselective activity. Although it is possible that the Zn-NSC73306
complex retains its activity, it seems that a stable complexed species of NSC73306 is not the MDR-selective active species; if it were,
significant improvement in activity and selectivity would be observed when using preformed complexes.
Given that phen complexes with a range of metal ions (Nb3+, Ce3+,
Sn2+, and La3+) were uncovered, we tested the MDR-selective activity of the free ligand. Following our initial article on the expression of
ABC genes and drug-gene pairs (7), a lanthanoid tris-phenathroline
complex (KP772 ([tris(1,10-phenanthroline)lanthanum(III)] trithiocyanate)) was reported to possess selective toxicity in MDR cells
(39). This compound was also tested by the DTP (NSC632737)
and, notably, our screen identifies it as a putative MDR-selective
compound (structural analogue of NSC292408, see Supplementary
Table S2). Phen and NSC292408 showed a similar MDR-selective activity (3.5- and 2.8-fold, respectively), suggesting that it is the free
ligand that is active. The La3+ and the SCN− counter-ion components
that complete KP772, as well as the other metal ions, were not toxic
in the dose windows studied. The ruthenium(II) complex ([Ru(phen)

than La(III) complexes (40), insignificant levels of phen would be exchanged from the Ru(II) complex in a 72-hour cytotoxicity experiment. The inert ruthenium complex was completely inactive. Of
the NSC292408 (a tin-phenanthroline complex) analogues available
for testing, only one, the platinum-phenanthroline NSC615541,
showed MDR-selective activity (Supplementary Table S2). The inactive NSC292408 analogues either lack the MDR-selective phen ligands or are such stable complexes that they may not be released
to exert their activity. The fact that these chelating ligands alone
possess cytotoxic response profiles similar to their metal chelates
indicates that the active metal complexes serve as carriers for the
chelators, which themselves are the active drug molecules, perhaps
by forming metal chelates in situ (31).

Discussion
An ultimate goal in cancer therapy is to devise individually tailored treatment protocols targeting specific pathways of cellular
proliferation or drug resistance. Pgp represents one of the beststudied mechanisms of resistance to hydrophobic anticancer drugs.
Pgp-mediated drug transport of cytotoxic drugs is modulated by a
wide range of agents, many of which have been tested in clinical
trials. However, despite the clear rationale for the use of efflux
inhibitors in combination with cytotoxic agents, the development
of these compounds has been slow, and the clinical benefit of Pgp
inhibition is still in question. Our aim was to explore the DTP drug
database for compounds that may offer a radically different solution
by exploiting, rather than suppressing, Pgp function to induce cytotoxicity. Such drugs (termed “MDR-selective compounds”) target
otherwise MDR cycling cells, without inhibiting the transporter
and avoiding side effects associated with the damage of resting cells
that constitutively express Pgp. We based our approach on the presumption that a positive correlation between a compound's cytotoxicity profile and the expression of Pgp in the NCI-60 cell panel
may be the result of a causal interaction, where the activity of Pgp
sensitizes the cell to the cytotoxicity of the compound. It may be
argued that this approach has several limitations: the cytotoxicity
profiles across the NCI60 panel are derived from single MTT assays,
leading to variability in the quality of the primary data; the possibility that compounds are not pure as submitted; and the activity of
drug metabolism and resistance pathways may confound the statistical approach, producing false negative and false positive results.
Given these and other confounding factors, it is remarkable that
37 MDR-selective compounds were validated in this study. Future
studies will determine if any of the compounds not available for
testing (Table 1) are also MDR selective. Of particular interest is
the series of perezone derivatives that appear in a structurally coherent group among the top-scoring untested compounds (Fig. 1).
The new MDR-selective compounds presented here have several
features reminiscent of NSC73306, the first Pgp-targeting drug
identified in our initial report (7).
Because the MDR-selective toxicity is reversed in the presence of
Pgp inhibitors, we can conclude that the enhanced toxicity of the
compounds shown in Table 2 is indeed dependent on Pgp activity,
and is not due to an off-target effect linked to the genetic drift of
KB-V1 cells. Furthermore, the results obtained with an isogenic cell
line pair support that functional expression of Pgp is necessary and
sufficient to convey increased sensitivity to these compounds.
The degree of Pgp-dependent toxicity varied; whereas some

www.aacrjournals.org

compounds showed a minor (albeit statistically significant)
MDR-selective activity, others, such as NSC693871, were considerably more toxic in KB-V1 cells. As observed with NSC73306, expression of Pgp in MDR cell lines decreased upon exposure to the
MDR-selective agents, supporting a causal link between the toxicity and Pgp function.7
Analysis of the MDR-selective molecules in the context of the
DTP drug database has the potential to relate the information in
the tumor cell line data set to structural feature analysis. Granted
that the general toxicity of the MDR-selective compounds identified here is probably mediated by a number of mechanisms, the
structural coherence of the Discovery set may imply shared modes
of MDR-selective toxicity that pertain to structurally related
compound subsets. There is a significant enrichment in certain
chemical features within the Discovery set: the nine TSCs comprise
14% of the Discovery set, while representing only 1% of the original
set of the screened compounds, and there are only 25 phen and
56 bipy compounds in the original data set (0.059% and 0.12%,
respectively). Thus, the enrichment of TSC (∼12-fold), phen (over
1,500-fold), and bipy (over 750-fold) reinforces that these features
are associated with MDR-selective activity. In all three structural
cohorts, there are two nitrogen atoms in a cis(1,4) arrangement,
separated by two carbons. The initial QSAR (Supplementary
Table S3) is a first step toward a systematic substructure analysis
coupled with statistical correlation of compound activity, to
highlight structural features necessary for MDR selectivity (41).
Recently, the TSC Dp44mT was reported to be more toxic to KBV1 cells (42). Dp44mT was not submitted to the DTP; therefore, it
does not appear in our list of putative MDR-selective agents. Interestingly, it also contains at least two hydrogen bond acceptors, a
hydrogen bond donor as well as an aromatic ring, underscoring
the pharmacophore model derived from the TSCs analyzed in this
study (Supplementary Fig. S2).
The abundance of metal chelators in the Discovery set is striking.
The eight metal-containing complexes represent 12.5% of the
Discovery set, whereas only 2.7% of the compounds found in the
DTP library form complexes (including sodium and calcium cation
formulations). Several MDR-selective compounds project to the S
region of the self-organizing map representing the DTP drug response data (Supplementary Fig. S3), along with chelating agents
targeting metallo enzymes, especially iron- and copper-dependent
proteins (31). Typically, metal complexes projecting to the S region
show some degree of similarity in both structure and cytotoxic
response profiles. Interestingly, the type of the chelated metal is
varied, suggesting that the cytotoxicity of S-region complexes is determined primarily by the organic component of the complex (the
ligand) and the type of metal is only playing a minor role (31). Our
results indicate that the MDR-selective chelators can form complexes with a range of biologically important metals ions, including
iron (Fig. 2). Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to the
design of iron or copper chelators as anticancer agents, and several
drugs in the clinic such as bleomycin, the anthraquinones, triapine,
and hydroxyurea show the validity and diversity of metal interaction as a viable chemotherapeutic target (38). Based on the results
obtained by this correlative observational study, we speculate that
metal ion interaction is key to the cytotoxicity of at least a subset of
the MDR-selective compounds. Iron-chelating drugs may kill cancer cells by a number of mechanisms, including (1) deprivation of

nutritionally essential iron, (2) iron-drug associations that lead to
redox cycling (6), or (3) highly specific metal-enzyme targets, such
as ribonucleotide reductase (43). We speculate that the activity of
Pgp may increase the susceptibility of the cells to these mechanisms. At the same time, our results also suggest that metal chelation
alone is not sufficient for Pgp-potentiated activity. Because metal
complexes were as active as the ligands alone (Table 4), chelates
may serve as chaperones facilitating free diffusion of the ligands into the cells (44). In line with this hypothesis, NSC73306 does not
interact with Pgp (18), whereas triapine (a TSC ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor devoid of MDR-selective activity) is actively effluxed by Pgp (45). Thus, it seems that evasion of Pgp-mediated
efflux as well as the ability to chelate metals are necessary, if not
sufficient requirements for the MDR-selective activity of the chelator compounds. Dissociation of the complexes within the cells leading to the release of the free ligand and MDR-selective activity may
be related to reactive oxygen species generated by redox cycling, as
has been shown for the activity of other TSCs (46).
Taken together, it seems that the target of the MDR-selective
compounds is not Pgp per se. The paradoxical vulnerability uncovered by the MDR-selective compounds may be linked to the efflux
of an endogenous substrate providing, e.g., redox resistance to the
influence of Pgp on membrane lipid composition, or to other,
Pgp-related metabolic changes that characterize MDR cells.
The results here indicate that MDR-selective compounds may be
used against MDR cells, providing a range of active pharmaco-

phores. According to a recent report, the TSC Dp44mT has broad
spectrum activity against a wide range of cancer cell types in vivo,
including those possessing the MDR phenotype mediated by Pgp
(42). The fact that a related TSC shows strong in vivo anticancer
activity in human xenografts is promising, and suggests that
the MDR-selective chelators identified in this study may have
potent and broad antitumor activity. Further evaluation of the
compounds identified here will help to elucidate this intriguing
modality, and provide the basis of a fresh therapeutic approach
to resolving MDR cancers.
