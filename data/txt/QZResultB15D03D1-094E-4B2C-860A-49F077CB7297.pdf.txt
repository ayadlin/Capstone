BACKGROUND: Chronic use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may lead to previously unrecognized adverse events. This study evaluated the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in chronic-phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) patients treated with imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. METHODS: Four hundred sixty-eight newly diagnosed CP CML patients
treated with TKIs were analyzed. The molecular and cytogenetic response data, creatinine, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were
followed from the start of therapy to the last follow-up (median, 52 months). GFR was estimated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (4%) had TKI-associated AKI. Imatinib was associated with a higher incidence of
AKI in comparison with dasatinib and nilotinib (P 5.014). Fifty-eight patients (14%) developed CKD while they were receiving a TKI;
49 of these patients (84%) did so while they were being treated with imatinib (P <.001). Besides imatinib, age, a history of hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were also associated with the development of CKD. In patients with no CKD at the baseline, imatinib was
shown to reduce GFR over time. Interestingly, imatinib did not cause a significant decline in the GFRs of patients with a history of
CKD. Imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib increased the mean GFR after 3 months of treatment, and nilotinib led with the most significant
increase (P <.001). AKI or CKD had no significant impact on overall cytogenetic and molecular response rates or survival. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of TKIs may be safe in the setting of CKD in CP CML patients, but close monitoring is still warranted.

INTRODUCTION
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Imatinib was
the first TKI to be successfully used in clinical medicine; it provided not only progression-free survival and overall survival
(OS) advantages but also fewer adverse effects in comparison with previous standard therapy with cytarabine and interferon.1 Second-generation TKIs such as nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib were later introduced, and they demonstrated
efficacy and safety for patients resistant to or intolerant of imatinib2,3 and, more recently, as initial therapy.4,5
Although TKIs are generally well tolerated and are associated with fewer adverse events than interferon-based therapy, these drugs demonstrate off-target effects. TKIs were designed to target BCR-ABL, a chimeric protein produced
from the BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region - abelson) fusion gene that originated from balanced translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22 (t(9;22)(q34;q11)).6 However, off-target kinases (eg, platelet-derived growth factor receptor a
[PDGFR-a], PDGFR-b, KIT, discoidin domain receptor 1, discoidin domain receptor 2, and colony stimulating factor
1) are also affected.7,8
Overall, imatinib has been well tolerated in clinical trials, and the side effect profile has usually been mild to moderate. Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), rash, muscle cramps, and edema have been commonly
occurring adverse effects.9 A series of case reports proposed that imatinib may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI).10-15 The
authors suggested that this side effect may be due to 2 mechanisms: toxic tubular damage and tumor lysis syndrome. Renal
tubular cells are susceptible to the toxic effects of medications because tubular cells are exposed to high levels of toxins
through the concentration and absorption of glomerular filtrates.16 It has been shown that PDGFRs are important to renal

tubular cell regeneration after acute tubular necrosis.17
Thus, imatinib may interfere with PDGFR-mediated
repair mechanisms.
There is a lack of data regarding the effects of longterm TKI treatment on kidney function and the incidence
and prognosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in CML
patients. One study suggested a decreased estimated
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients treated with
imatinib,18 and there are no similar analyses for secondgeneration TKIs. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the
incidence of AKI and CKD in chronic-phase (CP) CML
patients being treated with imatinib (standard and highdose), dasatinib, and nilotinib as initial therapy. We also
evaluated the GFR changes over time and their impact on
outcomes for these patients.

interventional studies; a waiver of informed consent was
granted for the retrospective chart review.
Follow-Up

A complete blood count and a complete metabolic profile
were performed for patients every 1 to 2 weeks for the first
3 months and then every 6 to 12 weeks. Laboratory data
from the start of TKI therapy were recorded and included
in the analysis for all patients as long as they stayed in the
clinical trial. Information about other medications and
clinical events that might be responsible for kidney function changes was also collected. Bone marrow aspiration
with the karyotype and reverse transcription–polymerase
chain reaction for BCR-ABL fusion transcripts from
peripheral blood were performed at diagnosis, every
3 months for the first year, and every 6 months thereafter.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Definitions

Study Group

The primary laboratory outcomes were creatinine and
GFR changes. Creatinine is not a sensitive test for determining kidney function because a significant portion of
the kidney function needs to be affected before it detects
any decline in GFR.18 In this study, GFR was estimated
with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation,
which has been shown to provide a more accurate estimate
than the Cockcroft-Gault method and other commonly
used equations.19 The primary clinical endpoints were
AKI and CKD. AKI20 was defined as an increase in the
serum creatinine level  0.3 mg/dL, and CKD21 was
defined as an estimated GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 persisting for at least 90 days.
Molecular responses were defined as follows: deep
molecular response (MR4.5; BCR-ABL1 transcript level 
0.0032% on the International Scale) and major molecular
response (MMR; BCR-AB1 transcript level  0.1% on the
International Scale). BCR-ABL1 transcript levels were calculated with the International Scale since 2005 when this
standardization became available. Karyotype analysis was
performed by G-banding in bone marrow cells with 20
metaphases analyzed. The cytogenetic response was defined
as follows: minor cytogenetic response (Philadelphia chromosome–positive metaphases > 35%), major cytogenetic
response (MCyR; Philadelphia chromosome–positive
metaphases between 0% and 35%), and complete cytogenetic response (CCyR; 0% Philadelphia chromosome–
positive metaphases).22

We reviewed medical records of 475 consecutive patients
with early CP CML treated with frontline TKI in consecutive prospective clinical trials at The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2001 and 2011.
Seven patients were excluded from the analysis because
they had received TKI for less than 3 months on account
of non–kidney-related toxicities (n 5 2) or patient preference (n 5 5). The starting dose of imatinib was 400 mg
twice daily for 204 patients and 400 mg once daily for 49
patients. Patients treated with dasatinib received 100 mg
(100 mg daily or 50 mg twice daily), and those treated
with nilotinib received a total daily dose of 800 mg (400
mg twice daily). To be eligible, patients should have been
diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome–positive or
BCR-ABL–positive early CP CML (time from diagnosis < 12 months). Patients should have received no or
minimal prior therapy, which was defined as <1 month
(30 days) of prior interferon-a (with or without cytarabine) and/or hydroxyurea. Other eligibility criteria
included a performance status of 0 to 2, an age  15 years,
and adequate end organ function (creatinine < 1.5 3
upper limit of normal, total bilirubin < 1.5 3 upper limit
of normal, and serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase < 2.5 3 upper limit of normal). Patients with
New York Heart Association class 3 to 4 heart disease, late
CP CML (time from diagnosis >12 months),
accelerated-phase (AP) CML, and blast-phase (BP) CML
were excluded. All treatment studies and this chart review
study were approved by the institutional review board of
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

statistical software (StataCorp LP, College Station,
Texas). Categorical variables were reported as percentages
and counts. Continuous variables were reported as
medians and ranges or means. The Kruskal-Wallis test
and the chi-square test were used to evaluate associations
between TKI types. Univariate and multivariate logistic
regression analysis was used to determine the relation
between clinical features (diabetes mellitus [DM], coronary artery disease [CAD], hypertension [HTN], age, and
type of TKI) and the development of AKI or CKD.
Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effects of the TKI type over time on GFR changes.
Survival probabilities and medians were estimated with
the Kaplan-Meier limit product method. Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated from the beginning of treatment to the date of any of the following events:
transformation to AP or BP, loss of MCyR, and death
while the patient was on a TKI. Transformation-free survival (TFS) was calculated from the start of treatment to
the date of progression to AP/BP during therapy, last
follow-up, or death from any cause. OS was calculated
until death from any cause at any time. Univariate and
multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used
to identify any association with each potential clinical
feature and survival (EFS, TFS, and OS). All tests were

2-sided, and a P value  .05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
A total of 468 early CP CML patients who were consecutively enrolled in trials with imatinib (n 5 253), dasatinib
(n 5 99), and nilotinib (n 5 116) were included in this
analysis. The clinical characteristics of the patients treated
with the different modalities were similar because the eligibility criteria were nearly identical for all clinical trials
(Table 1). The Sokal risk score23 was calculated for all
patients, and no significant difference was noted among
the 3 groups (P 5 .493). The median duration of TKI
treatment was 52 months, and it was longest for the imatinib group (87 months) because the clinical trials testing
imatinib started earlier than the ones testing other TKIs.
Medical comorbidities such as HTN, DM, and
CAD were found at similar rates among the patients in
each of the 3 cohorts. The median baseline creatinine levels were the same (0.9 mg/dL) for the patients treated with
imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. No difference in the
baseline GFR was observed among the 3 cohorts
(P 5 .106).
Nineteen patients (4%) had TKI-associated AKI
during follow-up (Table 2). The baseline creatinine level

increased at least 1.5-fold in 79% of these patients. The
median time from the start of TKI therapy to the first
occurrence of AKI was 9 days (range, 4-84 days). TKI was
held for 4 of the 19 patients (21%) for a median of 10
days. No patient had to discontinue or switch a TKI
because of AKI. Factors possibly contributing to the development of AKI were identified in 8 patients: 4 patients
were documented to have dehydration due to poor oral
intake (n 5 2) or diarrhea (n 5 2), 2 patients were on furosemide for fluid retention, and 2 other patients were on
prophylactic allopurinol at the time of AKI. No possible
contributing factors were identified for the remaining 11
patients. Among the 19 patients who developed AKI, 16
(84%) were treated with imatinib, and 3 (16%) were
treated with other TKIs (1 with dasatinib and 2 with nilotinib; P 5 .014; Table 3). Overall, 6%, 1%, and 2% of
the patients treated with imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib
developed AKI, respectively. Among the 16 patients who
developed AKI on imatinib, 15 were receiving a total daily
dose of 800 mg, and 1 patient was receiving a total daily
dose of 400 mg. Patients who had AKI were older
(P 5 .006) and were more likely to have prior diagnoses
of DM, HTN, or CAD (P < .05). The TKI type was the
only statistically significant factor (odds ratio, 5.7;
P 5 .010) associated with the development of AKI when
adjustments were made for the other clinical factors
(Table 3).
Forty-eight patients had a prior diagnosis of CKD at
the start of TKI treatment. The distributions of patients
Cancer

with a history of CKD were similar for all 3 TKI groups
(P 5 .241). Although the specific cause of this was not
purposely investigated, 60% (29 of 48) had underlying
DM, HTN, and/or CAD, and 48% were older than 65
years. Fifty-eight patients (14%) developed new-onset
CKD over the course of TKI therapy. Overall, 22% (49 of
226), 5% (5 of 93), and 4% (4 of 101) of CML patients
treated with imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, respectively, developed CKD. Five percent of instances of CKD
were classified as stage IV, and the rest were stage III disease according to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality
Initiative criteria.21 The median time interval from the
start of TKI therapy to the diagnosis of CKD was 12
months (range, 3-108 months). No TKI dose change was
made for patients who developed CKD. Forty-nine of
these 58 patients (84%) were on imatinib, and 9 (16%)
were on other TKIs (5 on dasatinib and 4 on nilotinib;
P < .001). The incidence of CKD was similar for patients
on imatinib at 400 or 800 mg (P 5 .711). The median
age was 60 years for patients with CKD and 45 years for
patients without CKD (P < .001; Table 3). DM, HTN,
and CAD were also associated with the development of
CKD (P < .010). In the multivariate analysis, age, treatment with imatinib, and the coexistence of DM or HTN
were found to be associated with the development of
CKD (P < .01). Among them, treatment with imatinib
was the most significant factor associated with the development of CKD with an odds ratio of 8.3 (95% confidence interval, 3.5-19.4; P < .001).

function (Fig. 1A) and with a history of CKD (Fig. 2A)

TKIs in these 2 cohorts. Among patients with no CKD at
the baseline, the GFR changes were significantly associated with the TKI used over time (P < .001). The mean
GFR declined significantly in patients treated with imatinib or dasatinib, and this decline was more prominent in
patients treated with imatinib (Fig. 1B). In the imatinib
group, at 3 and 6 months, the mean GFR declined from
the baseline by 8 and 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively.
This downward trend continued for 4 years and then stabilized. We also analyzed whether the GFR change was
affected by the starting dose of imatinib. The changes
were similar in both groups, and this suggested there was
no dose effect within the tested doses (P 5 .319; Fig. 3).
In the dasatinib group, the mean GFR decline was modest
at 3 and 6 months (3 and 4 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively), and it stabilized after 1 year. Interestingly, the
mean GFR increased slightly in patients treated with nilotinib. The mean increase from the baseline was 4 mL/
min/1.73 m2 after 3 months of therapy with nilotinib
(P < .001), and GFR remained above the baseline
throughout the treatment.

Among patients with CKD at the baseline, the mean
GFR changes were significantly associated with the TKI type
over time (P < .001). The mean GFR increased after 3
months of treatment in all TKI groups (Fig. 2A). It increased
by 14 mL/min/1.73 m2 among patients treated with nilotinib and by 3 and 6 mL/min/1.73 m2 among patients treated
with imatinib and dasatinib, respectively (Fig. 2B). At the 6month follow-up, the mean GFR trended down in all
groups, but it was still above the baseline. By the end of 24
months, the mean GFR difference from the baseline was
slightly lower (1 mL/min/1.73 m2) for imatinib and higher
(4 mL/min/1.73 m2) for the dasatinib cohort. In contrast,
among nilotinib-treated patients, the mean GFR increased
from the baseline by 8 and 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 at the 12and 24-month follow-up, respectively.
CCyR, MMR, and MR4,5 rates were not significantly different between patients who developed AKI and
patients who did not (Table 3). In contrast, patients who
developed CKD while on they were on a TKI were found
to have higher rates of CCyR (98% vs 89%; P 5 .063)
and MMR (97% vs 84%; P 5 .021) than patients who
did not have CKD. Similarly, the MR4,5 rates were 86%
and 63% for patients who developed CKD and patients
who did develop CKD, respectively (P 5 .001). However,
in the multivariate analysis, no association was found
between cytogenetic or molecular responses and CKD.

interruption because of AKI (it was held for 5 days). There
were no associations between the development of CKD
and EFS, TFS, or OS (Fig. 5A-C). AKI, age, and
CAD were significantly associated with the risk of dying
(Table 4). Patients who developed CKD appeared to have
better OS (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval,
0.10-0.97; P 5 .044), but CKD had no association with
EFS or TFS.
DISCUSSION
This analysis suggests that treatment with imatinib and,
to a lesser degree, dasatinib in CML patients with relatively normal kidney function is associated with a decline
in GFR over time. In contrast, CML patients with CKD
at the baseline did not experience any further decline in
GFR, regardless of the TKI used. Nilotinib was the only
TKI associated with a modest but significant increase in
GFR from the baseline. Interestingly, this increment was
more obvious in CML patients with CKD. Among these

TKIs, only imatinib was found to be associated with the
development of AKI. It should be acknowledged that the
larger proportion of patients treated with imatinib in our
Cancer

imatinib cohort received a higher starting dose (ie,
800 mg daily). When comparing the changes in GFR in
patients treated with the standard dose of imatinib and
patients treated with the higher dose of imatinib, we did
not identify any difference in the changes in GFR, and
this suggested there might not be a dose effect. However,
this would have to be confirmed in patients more uniformly treated at the standard dose.
Because most patients with CML are likely to receive
a TKI for prolonged periods of time and possibly indefinitely, it has become important to understand the longterm consequences of exposure to these drugs.24 This is
the first study evaluating and comparing renal function in
CML patients receiving imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib.
In this analysis, patients who developed AKI were older
and were more likely to have DM, HTN, or CAD. Age
and these medical comorbidities are known risk factors
for renal disease. However, in our study, multivariate
analyses showed that imatinib was an independent factor
for the development of AKI. In some reports, tumor lysis

Original Article

syndrome has been suggested as a risk factor for the development of AKI in patients treated with imatinib.25,26
This could be an important consideration, especially for
AP or BP CML. However, in our study population, none
of the patients who developed AKI had changes in uric
acid or potassium levels or any other clinical features that
might be considered diagnostic or suggestive of tumor
lysis syndrome. TKIs are also inhibitors of PDGFR-a and
PDGFR-b receptors. It has been shown that PDGFRs are
involved in tubulogenesis and are distributed mainly in renal tubules and, to a lesser extent, in the glomerulus of a
normal rat kidney. Messenger RNA expression of
PDGFRs is enhanced after ischemic injury.17 Although
the molecular mechanisms of TKI renal toxicity have not
been thoroughly recognized or investigated, it has been
suggested that inhibition of the platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF) B-chain/PDGFR axis by PDGFR-b–
selective agents such as trapidil may worsen renal
ischemia-perfusion injury in rats.27 On the basis of these
observations, it has been proposed that PDGF blockage
should be avoided during ischemia-reperfusion injury of
the renal tubules.17,27 In a handful of the patients reported
here, there was some suggestion of concomitant dehydration that may have caused poor renal perfusion. However,
most patients did not have such identifiable factors that
could have triggered poor perfusion.
The inhibitory effect of PDGF B-chain/PDGFR
axis blockage on tubular regeneration has been mainly
shown in ischemia-reperfusion animal models.28 In contrast, in all other animal injury models, the blockage of
PDGF has appeared to have the opposite effect, with an
improvement in renal function.29-38 For instance, several
studies have shown that there is an improvement in
renal function with TKI therapy in animal models of
nephropathies such as diabetic nephropathy,37 nephroangiosclerosis,39 lupus nephritis,38 and chronic allograft nephropathy.40 Inhibition of PDGFR in some of these
models has been associated with decreased mesenchymal
proliferation and matrix accumulation. PDGF has been
commonly implicated in the pathogenesis of progressive
kidney injury in human disease and experimental models.41 PDGF is synthesized by renal cells and infiltrating
macrophages, which are frequently associated with progressive renal injury.36,42,43 PDGF plays a role in nephropathy by stimulating mesangial cell proliferation and
increasing extracellular matrix synthesis,44 and PDGF
blockage has been suggested as a possible mechanism for
attenuating progression of CKD.28 Iyoda et aI45 reported
that nilotinib-treated rats had less proteinuria and attenuated glomerulosclerosis in experimental renal disease.

This observation is concordant with our observation that
patients with normal kidney function or CKD who were
treated with nilotinib had stable or improved GFR. It
does not, however, explain the differences observed
between the 3 inhibitors when we consider that all 3 are
PDGFR inhibitors (Fig. 1). It is likely that the renal dysfunction associated with TKI therapy is multifactorial.
Further studies are required to understand the mechanism
by which TKIs may adversely affect renal function.
Interestingly, patients with a history of CKD had no
significant decline in GFR after they had been treated
with imatinib or dasatinib, and there was a modest
increase in GFR in patients treated with nilotinib
(Fig. 2B). This observation should be considered with caution because patients with higher levels of creatinine were
excluded from the trials. Still, some patients had modest renal dysfunction as assessed by GFR, but this should not be
considered proof of the safety of these agents in patients
with more significant renal dysfunction. Studies specifically
directed at such patients are required to better define the
safety of different TKIs in that patient population.
Age is an important factor in renal function because
the average GFR declines over time.46 Wetzels et al47
reported a 0.4 mL/min/y decline in the estimated GFRs
of 869 healthy individuals. In our analysis, we did not
have a control group. However, the mean decline in GFR
observed in our study population was remarkably greater
than that proposed in the aforementioned study, and this
makes it less likely that the observed decline in GFR was
entirely due to aging. In the first 5 years, the mean decline
in GFR was approximately 3 and 1 mL/min/y for imatinib and dasatinib, respectively. GFR then remained relatively stable after the 5th year in the imatinib group
(Fig. 1A). This may suggest that imatinib use beyond 5
years may not be a risk factor for further GFR decline.
In conclusion, AKI occurs in a small percentage of
patients treated with TKIs and particularly in those
treated with imatinib. The effect tends to be mild and
usually requires no treatment interruptions or changes in
the TKI. Still, it is important to monitor renal function,
particularly early during the course of therapy, because
most AKI cases occur during the first 3 months of therapy.
Imatinib and, to a lesser extent, dasatinib may decrease
GFR levels early during the course of treatment, but this
GFR change is not clinically significant and is not associated with any significant impact on response rates or survival. Thus, the administration of these drugs may be safe
in the setting of CKD in CP CML patients, but further
studies are needed in this patient population to confirm
this observation.
