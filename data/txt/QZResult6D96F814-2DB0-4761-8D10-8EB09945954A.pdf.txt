BACKGROUND. Bisphosphonates (BPs) are effective in the prevention and treatment of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with symptomatic myeloma
who are receiving chemotherapy. Recent data also suggest a possible antineoplastic activity of BPs. Few studies published to date have explored the role of BPs in
patients with untreated, asymptomatic myeloma (AM). No data are available on
the efficacy of zoledronic acid in these patients.

METHODS. The authors conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase
3, randomized trial comparing the administration of zoledronic acid versus simple observation in patients with AM. One-hundred sixty-three patients were
enrolled and randomized (1:1) to receive zoledronic acid (n 5 81 patients) or not
to receive zoledronic acid (n 5 82 patients) for 1 year at a dose of 4 mg monthly
as a single, 15-minute, intravenous infusion.
RESULTS. After a median follow-up of 64.7 person-months, 44.4% of patients in
the zoledronic acid group and 45.1% of the control group progressed to ‘symptomatic’ myeloma requiring chemotherapy (P 5 .9307). The median time to progression was 67 months and 59 months for the treatment and control groups,
respectively (P 5 .8312). At progression, SREs were significantly lower in the zole-

whereas anemia, renal failure, and extramedullary disease were not statistically

group were asymptomatic hypocalcemia and fever. One patient developed reversible osteonecrosis of the jaw. No renal failure caused by zoledronic acid was

absence of end-organ damage or tissue involvement,
such as anemia, bone lesions, hypercalcemia, and renal failure, or by other relevant clinical conditions,
such as hyperviscosity, amyloidosis, and recurrent
infections.2 AM differentiates from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) on
the basis of higher levels of circulating M-component
(>3 g/dL) and/or a percentage of bone marrow
plasma cells (BMPCs) >10%.2 The annual progression rate of AM into ‘symptomatic’ or ‘active’ MM is
approximately 10% during the first 5 years.1 This
favorable clinical outcome and the occurrence of relevant side effects of chemotherapies suggest the use
of simple observation in these patients,3 whereas
conventional chemotherapy4-6 and even the use of
new drugs, such as thalidomide,7,8 generally are not
recommended until end-organ damage develops.
Bisphosphonates (BPs) have entered clinical
practice as a useful adjunct for the treatment of
symptomatic MM, providing, in controlled trials,
effective results in terms of reduction of skeletalrelated events (SREs) (bone lesions, pathologic fractures, spinal compression requiring radiotherapy, and
hypercalcemia) and pain control.9-13 However, in
vitro, BPs also have demonstrated some direct or
indirect antineoplastic activities.14,15 These effects
have been investigated particularly on both tumor
and bone marrow stromal cells of MM.16-20 Furthermore, evidence of a possible antimyeloma effect of
BPs has been reported occasionally in some
patients.21,22 It is noteworthy that some subcategories of patients with MM who received BPs along
with chemotherapy had improved survival with
respect to controls who received the same chemotherapy but without BPs.11,13 Therefore, theoretically,
there may be a rationale for using BPs in patients
with AM if a role is hypothesized for these agents in
interfering with the transforming process from indolent to active disease, which is mediated at least in
part by the strict interactions that exist between clonal tumor cells and the bone marrow microenvironment.23,24 In this setting, pamidronate, a secondgeneration BP, was able to reduce bone turnover and
to decrease the development of SREs at progression,
albeit without evidence of significant antitumor
effects in terms of the rate of transformation or the
time to disease evolution into ‘symptomatic,’ overt
MM.25-27
Zoledronic acid (zoledronate) is a third-generation, nitrogen-containing BP with higher activity and
better in vitro-defined antitumor effects with respect
to other BPs.28 Zoledronic acid has demonstrated significant efficacy on bone disease in symptomatic
MM29-31 and is used largely in clinical practice. Thus,

1589

zoledronic acid may represent a reasonable agent to
test in the early stages of disease, such as AM.
Accordingly, we conducted a clinical trial to verify
the effects of zoledronic acid in patients with AM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This was a prospective, multicenter, open-label,
phase 3, randomized clinical trial comparing administration of zoledronic acid versus simple observation
in patients with AM who did not require further
treatments. The study started in June 2001 and was
closed in June 2004. Nine Italian Centers enrolled
evaluable patients.
Inclusion criteria for participation were as follows: immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin A Mcomponent >2 g/dL; BMPCs >10%; hemoglobin level
>11.5 g/dL; no evidence of bone disease; normal
serum levels of creatinin (<1.2 mg/dL), calcium (<10
mg/dL), b2 microglobulin (<3 mg/dL), albumin
(>3.5 g/dL), C-reactive protein (<5 mg/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (<480 IU/L); no bone pain; a
World Health Organization performance status 0 or
1; no evidence of amyloidosis; and no concomitant
or previous active treatments for myeloma. In doubtful cases, the absence of skeletal lesions was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
positron emission tomography (PET), as appropriate.
These criteria, which were defined arbitrarily in 2001,
corresponded in all patients to the current definition
of AM more recently suggested by the International
Myeloma Working Group2 and also identified only
stage I patients according to the International Staging System,32 both of which were published after
the start of our study. One difference was the lower
level of M-component (2 g/dL instead of 3 g/dL) that
we chose to have the possibility of including a larger
number of patients; however, we excluded patients
with ‘true’ MGUS, because only patients with >10%
BMPCs were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were
another cancer, psychiatric disease, and severe cardiac, respiratory or liver dysfunction
The study was approved by the institutional
review board at each participating center. All patients
provided written informed consent before entering
the study, in compliance with the ethical principles
derived from the Declaration of Helsinki, from good
clinical practice guidelines, and from applicable
legislation.
Study Design and Procedures
Randomization (1:1) to receive or not receive zoledronic acid was performed at the individual center

level by using a method of sequence generation
based on a local random-number table. In patients
who were randomized to receive the drug, zoledronic
acid (Zometa; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Origgio,
Italy) was administered for 1 year on an outpatient
basis, at a dose of 4 mg as a single, monthly, 15minute intravenously infusion. Controls simply were
observed. We chose to administer zoledronic acid for
1 year only after a wide panel discussion in which
the majority of participating centers concluded that
this period was long enough to provide clinical and
safety indications and to be well accepted by
patients, reducing the risk of possible side effects
and of an excessive dropout rate in a population
without need of other specific treatments.
Patients were monitored by evaluating hemoglobin levels, white blood cell and platelet counts, liver
function and clotting tests, total protein levels, serum
protein electrophoresis, urine analysis, C-reactive
protein, lactate dehydrogenase and serum b2 microglobulin levels every 3 months in both groups of
patients. Electrolytes and renal function also were
determined every month in patients who were
receiving zoledronic acid to evaluate its safety. Bone
marrow examination, x-ray skeletal survey (and MRI
or PET studies, if necessary) also were repeated every
year or when clinically indicated. These examinations were not centralized.
The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year
progression-free survival (PFS), which was measured
from the time of the first visit of the study. Secondary
endpoints were the time to progression (TTP), the
percentage of progressed patients with SREs, and the
safety/tolerability of zoledronic acid in this setting of
patients.
To define progression into symptomatic MM, the
appearance of 1 or more of the following criteria
(related to myeloma and excluding any other possible cause) was required: anemia (<11 g/dL hemoglobin), abnormal creatinine (both with at least 2
consecutive measurements), SREs (single or multiple
osteolytic lesions, pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia), or extramedullary tumors. In all such patients,
an active treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) was started. The simple increase of M-component and/or BMPCs generally was not considered
disease progression, with the exception of 2 patients
(1 in the zoledronic acid group and 1 in the control
group), who received therapy because these parameters increased rapidly, although in the absence of
other signs or symptoms. However, in nearly all
patients, progressive disease (as defined above) was
accompanied by at least a 25% increase in M-component and/or BMPCs.

Statistical Analysis
On the basis of 85% power, a sample size of 208
patients (104 patients per arm) was required initially
to detect a 20% difference (from an expected 50% to
30% difference) in the proportion of zoledronic acidtreated patients experiencing progressive disease at 5
years with respect to the control group (constant
hazard ratio, 1.737; a error, .05; P 5 .05; 2-sided;
nQuery Advisor, version 7.0; Statistical Solutions Ltd.,
Dublin, Ireland). To compensate for nonevaluable
patients, we planned to enroll 115 patients per
group.
An interim analysis was done for safety monitoring in May 2004 because of the description of the
first cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in
patients with myeloma who were receiving BP.33,34 At
that time, the steering committee determined that
this was not an acceptable risk for patients who
otherwise did not require specific treatments (for further details, see Discussion, below) and decided to
prematurely stop the trial in June 2004 after 163
patients had been randomized (70.8% of the planned
sample size). The final analysis was performed as of
December, 31, 2007.
Central and dispersion statistics for continuous
variables and frequency and percentages for categorical variables were used (SAS version 9.1 for Windows
XP). In particular, univariate logistic regression (Proc.
Logistic) was used to investigate the relations
between the development of SREs and exposure to
zoledronic acid. PFS and TTP analysis methodology
(product limit survival) was applied to estimate
the median time free from disease progression with
log-rank tests and the Kaplan-Meier method for
comparisons between groups (Proc Life Test) and
with log-time exponential regression to model the
right-censored data and to estimate the slope and
95% confidence interval (CI) (Proc Life Reg). The
Fisher exact test was used to evaluate the statistical
differences in progression and survival rates (Stat
Exact, version 7.0).

RESULTS
Enrolment and Follow-up
Overall, 198 patients were evaluated for participating
this study (Fig. 1). Thirty-five patients were excluded
(n 5 20 patients who did not meet criteria, n 5 12
patients who refused to participate, and n 5 3
patients who were excluded for other reasons).
Therefore, 163 patients with AM were enrolled and
randomized. Table 1 shows their main clinical and
laboratory characteristics at baseline. The 2 groups
were comparable in terms of age, sex, time from

Seven patients (3 patients in the zoledronic acid
group and 4 patients in the control group) died for reasons unrelated to AM or treatment between 6 months

and 49 months (Fig. 1). Seven additional patients (3
patients in the zoledronic acid-treated group and 4
patients in the control group) were lost to follow-up after 6 months to 26 months. However, all 163 patients
were analyzed by group, including 81 patients who
received zoledronic acid and 82 nontreated control
patients (Fig. 1). Excluding the patients who died or
were lost at follow-up, all other patients had at least 36
months of complete observation.

Safety
Among the zoledronic acid-treated patients, 15
patients experienced asymptomatic hypocalcemia
(without need to stop treatment and promptly corrected by oral substitutive therapy), and 7 patients
developed fever after the initial infusions (1 patient
interrupted early drug administration). One patient
developed a reversible ONJ at the end of the treatment that remitted completely after ozone and antibiotic therapy.35 We also were informed of a second

case of ONJ that developed in a patient who continued on therapy with zoledronic acid beyond the 12
planned cycles (protocol violation). No patient had
renal failure attributable to zoledronic acid treatment.

Efficacy
No significant reduction of M-component (>25%) or
BMPCs was observed throughout the study in either
group. After 9491 cumulative person-months of follow-up (median, 64.7 person-months; range, 36-72
person-months), there were 36 progressions (44.4%)

37 progressions (45.1%) in the control group (odds
ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.55-1.91; P 5 .9307). The percentage of patients who progressed at 5 years (primary endpoint) was 42% versus 42.7% of patients
who did not progress (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.551.92; P 5 .9272) (Table 2). The median TTP (Fig. 2)
was 67 months in the zoledronic acid group and 59
months in the control group (P 5 .8312). PFS was
almost identical in both groups (P 5 .7901).
At the time of progression, SREs were significantly lower in the zoledronic acid group (n 5 20
patients; 55.5%) than in the control group (n 5 29
patients; 78.3%; odds ratio, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.04-8.06; P
5 .041) whereas anemia, renal failure, and extramedullary disease were not statistically different
between the 2 groups (Table 3). Similarly, the levels
of M-component (median: 3.8 g/dL [range, 2.8-6.1 g/dL]
in the zoledronic acid group vs 3.7 g/dL [range, 3-5.7
g/dL] in the control group) and BMPCs (median:
35% range, 22%-95%] in zoledronic acid group vs
36% [range, 24%-100%] in the control group) also
were similar at progression (P value not significant).
Finally, there were no significant differences in outcome between patients with BMPCs <20% versus
>20% or between patients with or without osteoporosis at baseline (data not shown).

Treatment After Evolution Into Symptomatic
Myeloma and Survival
All patients received active treatments after progression to symptomatic MM. Overall, these treatments
were quite heterogeneous and included autologous
stem cell transplantation in approximately 40% of
patients in both groups. The overall response to firstline therapy after progression did not differ, with
approximately two-thirds of patients responding in
both groups (data not shown). On December, 31,
2007, 14 of 36 patients (38.8%) in the zoledronic acid
group who progressed and 15 of 37 patients (40.5%)
in the control group had died from MM (odds ratio,
1.07; 95% CI, 0.38-3.04; P 5 .8381).

DISCUSSION
The use of BPs has not been investigated extensively
in patients with AM. One report described 12
patients with ‘smoldering’ or ‘indolent’ myeloma
who received 12 pamidronate courses.25 One minor
response, 8 patients with stable disease, and 3 patients
with disease progression were observed. Circulating
levels of some cytokines potentially involved in bone
disease (interleukin-6, interleukin-1b, and oncostatinM) remained stable, whereas tumor necrosis factor a
levels increased. Bone density also was augmented,
but markers of bone resorption and bone formation
decreased, suggesting a reduction of bone turnover in
the absence of significant antitumor effects.
In our 2 previous studies, ‘prophylactic’ administration of pamidronate was evaluated in patients
with untreated stage I/IIA or ‘smoldering myeloma.’26,27 Pamidronate did not reduce the rate of
or the time required to develop symptomatic disease.
In addition, no significant effect on the M-component level was observed, but the development of
SREs decreased significantly.26,27 Accordingly, the

1593

recently updated American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guidelines on the role of BP in
MM are not changed from the initial (2002) statement, confirming that starting BP is not recommended for patients with solitary plasmocytoma or
smoldering (asymptomatic) or indolent myeloma.36
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study exploring the role of zoledronic acid in patients
with AM. Zoledronic acid is a molecule approximately 1000-fold more potent than pamidronate that
has documented in vitro antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and cytotoxic effects against myeloma cells.37,38
Zoledronic acid also exerts in vitro antiangiogenesis
and immunomodulating (on g-d lymphocytes and
dendritic cells) activities as well as modulation of adhesion molecules and interference with mevalonate
metabolic pathway.39-44 It is noteworthy that Berenson et al recently reported a better survival rate with
zoledronic acid than with pamidronate among chemotherapy-treated patients with MM who had high
baseline bone alkaline phosphatase levels.45 Similarly,
Aviles et al confirmed a possible favorable impact of
zoledronic acid on the response rate, event-free survival, and overall survival of patients with MM who
received standard chemotherapy.46
Despite these favorable reports, we could not
demonstrate a significant benefit from zoledronic
acid in AM patients, at least in terms of the percentage of transformation into overt myeloma and PFS/
TTP duration. By contrast, a reduction in SREs at the
time of disease progression was observed. This finding is similar to our previous reports on the use of
pamidronate in patients with AM.26,27 In the current
study, however, a trend in favor of zoledronic acid
was evident during the first 2 years of observation
(Fig. 2). This raises the question of whether a longer
period of zoledronic acid administration could be
more effective in this setting.
BPs generally are tolerated well; however, since
2004, the use of BPs has been associated with a possible increased risk of ONJ.33 The patients with the
greatest risk of developing ONJ seem to be those
with MM who have received zoledronic acid for
more than 24 months.47-49 By using adequate prophylactic measures, such as a careful baseline dental
assessment, oral hygiene, and no invasive local procedures during the treatment with BP, the risk of ONJ
decreases significantly.50,51 However, in 2004, this information was not available, and the exact relation
between zoledronic acid and ONJ was not clearly
established. At that time, we decided to interrupt our
study as a prudential measure, to decrease the risk
of ONJ in otherwise asymptomatic patients. This
choice, taken for ethical considerations, undoubtedly

1594

CANCER

reduced the statistical power of the current trial and
may have limited the validity of our conclusions,
which will need confirmation in subsequent studies.
In conclusion, ‘prophylactic’ administration of
zoledronic acid for 1 year in patients with untreated,
early-stage AM was feasible, had predictable and
manageable side effects, and decreased the development of SREs at the time of disease progression;
however, it did not produce any clinical antitumor
effects and did not reduce the risk of transformation
into overt, ‘symptomatic’ MM. A recently started randomized trial by the GIMEMA (Italian Group for
Adult Hematologic Diseases) that is characterized
by a larger number of patients with AM, a longer
treatment with zoledronate (2 years), a careful ONJ
prophylaxis, and multiple endpoints, including instrumental (PET, MRI) and biologic (bone turnover
markers) parameters, will provide further information
regarding zoledronic acid treatment in this field.
