Abstract
Arsenic is a carcinogen with transplacental activity that can
affect human skin stem cell population dynamics in vitro by
blocking exit into differentiation pathways. Keratinocyte stem
cells (KSC) are probably a key target in skin carcinogenesis.
Thus, we tested the effects of fetal arsenic exposure in Tg.AC
mice, a strain sensitive to skin carcinogenesis via activation of
the v-Ha-ras transgene likely in KSCs. After fetal arsenic
treatment, offspring received topical 12-O-tetradecanoyl
phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) through adulthood. Arsenic alone
had no effect, whereas TPA alone induced papillomas and
squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). However, fetal arsenic
treatment before TPA increased SCC multiplicity 3-fold more
than TPA alone, and these SCCs were much more aggressive
(invasive, etc.). Tumor v-Ha-ras levels were 3-fold higher with
arsenic plus TPA than TPA alone, and v-Ha-ras was overexpressed early on in arsenic-treated fetal skin. CD34, considered a marker for both KSCs and skin cancer stem cells, and
Rac1, a key gene stimulating KSC self-renewal, were greatly
increased in tumors produced by arsenic plus TPA exposure
versus TPA alone, and both were elevated in arsenic-treated
fetal skin. Greatly increased numbers of CD34-positive
probable cancer stem cells and marked overexpression of
RAC1 protein occurred in tumors induced by arsenic plus TPA
compared with TPA alone. Thus, fetal arsenic exposure,
although by itself oncogenically inactive in skin, facilitated
cancer response in association with distorted skin tumor stem
cell signaling and population dynamics, implicating stem cells
as a target of arsenic in the fetal basis of skin cancer in
adulthood. [Cancer Res 2008;68(20):8278–85]

Introduction
Compelling evidence indicates that events in utero could affect
the development of human disease during adulthood (1–3). This
concept first arose from data correlating low birth weight with
adult-onset disease, indicating that early-life undernutrition caused
permanent changes precipitating untoward effects much later in
life (1, 2). Fetal chemical exposures similarly could cause adverse
effects in adulthood, exemplified by the observation that

transplacental carcinogens can initiate oncogenesis in utero,
thereby producing cancers in adult humans or rodents (4). The
time difference between fetal exposure and adulthood cancer
requires the underlying etiology to be quiescent for extended
periods, but still clearly sensitive to subsequent stimulation.
Emerging theories predict that many cancers likely arise in
pluripotent stem cell populations (5–7), and the normal stem cell
qualities of quiescence, self-renewal, and ‘‘immortality’’ would
allow for a lifelong, latent neoplastic cell population (7). Fetal stem
cells are probably key targets in transplacental carcinogenesis (4)
and may affect fetal sensitivity based, at least in part, on relative
abundance. However, the identity of the normal cells that first
acquire the molecular lesions initiating cancer remains elusive (8),
regardless of the life-stage of initiation.
Inorganic arsenic is a transplacental carcinogen in mice (9) and
probably humans (10). Fetal exposure to arsenic in mice can induce
or initiate tumors or preneoplasias in a wide variety of tissues in
adulthood (9), including several concordant with human sites of
arsenic carcinogenesis, like the bladder and lung (9, 11). The
propensity for arsenic to act as a multisite transplacental
carcinogen seems to be in keeping with fetal stem cells as a
critical target population in transplacental carcinogenesis (4).
However, skin cancers, although common in arsenic-exposed
humans (11), have not been seen after in utero arsenic exposure
in mice, although the strains used to date are not particularly prone
to skin cancer (9). In adult rodents, inorganic arsenic could clearly
affect skin carcinogenesis, acting as a cocarcinogen which, by itself,
is inactive and only affects tumor development when given with
some additional treatment such as topical 12-O-tetradecanoyl
phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or UV irradiation (12–14). Recent studies
in human skin cancer models in vitro indicate that arsenic can slow
epidermal stem cell exit into differentiation pathways, thereby
distorting population dynamics (15, 16). In effect, arsenic increases
the relative proportion of the epidermal stem cells in culture,
leading to the hypothesis that this may be a key target cell
population for in vivo carcinogenesis (15, 16). Accepting that
cancer is a disease driven by stem/progenitor cell dysregulation (5),
an arsenic-induced increase in skin stem cell number or similar
dysregulation in vivo might potentially remain quiescent yet
facilitate cancer after subsequent stimulation, although this has
not been tested directly.
Based on converging hypotheses that arsenic as a transplacental
carcinogen may target fetal stem cells and that it may have the
ability to affect skin stem cell population number/dynamics, the
effects of fetal arsenic exposure on skin carcinogenesis were tested
in Tg.AC transgenic mice, a strain sensitive to skin cancer (17–19).

Arsenic, Stem Cells, and Skin Cancer

Tg.AC mice are well-suited for this study as they are susceptible to
the development of skin cancers via the activation of the v-Ha-ras
transgene, probably when the activation occurs in keratinocyte
stem cells (KSC; refs. 17, 18). Activation of the transgene in KSCs is
very likely a key, early event in Tg.AC skin carcinogenesis (17, 18)
and Tg.AC skin is considered genetically preinitiated with KSCs
representing a latent neoplastic stem cell population needing only
appropriate stimulation to develop tumors (17). These mice
typically develop papillomas, and to a lesser extent, squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC; ref. 17). SCC is common in humans in which
arsenicosis is endemic (11) and in adult mouse skin cancer models
using arsenic with other skin carcinogens (14). A further advantage
to this model system is that a specific molecular marker for KSCs
in mouse skin, i.e., CD34, has been well-defined in Tg.AC mice (17–
19). CD34 expression not only seems critical to the carcinogenic
process in mouse skin (18), but has now also been convincingly
established as a marker for cancer stem cells (CSC) in murine
epidermal skin tumors like SCC (20).

Materials and Methods
Animals and treatment. Animal care was provided in accordance with
the U.S. Public Health Policy on the Care and Use of Animals as defined in
the Guide to the Care and Use of Animals (NIH Publication 86-23). Mice
were housed under conditions of controlled temperature, humidity, and
light cycle. The tumor study was performed at the National Cancer
Institute-Frederick animal facility (Frederick, MD). Fetal skin sample
collection was performed at Integrated Laboratory Systems, Inc. (Research
Triangle Park, NC). Homozygous Tg.AC mice were obtained from Taconic
Farms and used in both studies.
For skin tumors, 30 timed primigravid mice were randomly divided into
groups of 10 and given drinking water with sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) at 0
(control), 42.5 ppm arsenite (low), or 85 ppm arsenite (high) ad libitum from
days 8 to 18 of gestation. After birth, offspring were weaned at 4 weeks and
randomly put into groups (initial n = 50) of equal numbers of males and
females based on maternal exposure and then exposed to TPA (2 Ag/0.1 mL
acetone, twice a week to a shaved area of the dorsal skin) or vehicle
(acetone) for 36 weeks. Dam body weights and water consumption were
recorded during gestation. Offspring weights were recorded weekly from
birth. Mice were checked daily and sacrificed when significant clinical signs
developed or at 40 weeks.
To assess molecular changes in fetal skin, timed primigravid mice were
given drinking water containing sodium arsenite at 0 or 85 ppm arsenite

ad libitum from days 8 to 18 of gestation ( five mice/group). On gestation
day 19, dams and fetuses were sacrificed and samples of fetal skin were
taken for analysis.
Tumor assessment. During TPA exposure, tumor growth was monitored
carefully. Mice found moribund or cachetic or with a tumor the size of 1.5 
1.5 cm were euthanized to alleviate pain or distress. Remaining mice were
killed at 40 weeks. Skin tumors were fixed in buffered formalin, sectioned
and stained with H&E. All skin tumors were assessed histologically, and
pathologic stage and number per animal were determined. Some tumors
were also used for immunochemistry or molecular analysis. A complete
necropsy was also performed and non–skin lesions that occurred will be
reported elsewhere.
Tumor immunohistochemistry. Skin tumors were compared for
localization and intensity of RAC1 and CD34. For this, advanced papillomas
with clear mesenchymal and epithelial components and monoclonal antiRAC1 and anti-CD34 antibodies (BD Biosciences) and Vector Elite kits
(Vector Labs) were used. The primary antibodies were used at a 1:100
(CD34) or 1:10,000 (RAC1) dilutions. To define specificity, the primary
antibodies were omitted from each staining series as a control.
Gene transcript analysis. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol agent
(Invitrogen), and purified (RNeasy columns, Qiagen), and transcript levels
were quantified using real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total
RNA was reverse-transcribed with High-Capacity cDNA reverse transcription
kit (Applied Biosystems), and subjected to real-time-PCR analysis using
either Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Rac1, CD34, DSS1, cyclin D1,
Sprr2a, Ptges, and Colla2) or TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (v-Ha-ras
and p16; Applied Biosystems). Cycle time (Ct) values were normalized with
18S from the same sample, and the relative differences were calculated and
expressed as a ratio of control (set as 1.0) or as a percentage of TPA alone
(set as 100%). For consistency, only males were used for transcript analysis.
Data analysis. Data are expressed as mean F SE or as a percentage of
mice at risk (incidence). Papilloma and SCC multiplicity represents mean
tumors/mouse and comes from 47 to 49 mice per treatment group
originally derived at random from 10 litters per treatment group. Papillomas
in TPA-treated mice also progressed to mesenchymal spindle cell sarcomas
(21) but as fetal arsenic had no effect on these tumors, they were not
considered further. Adult transcript data were from four to five individual
samples randomly selected from control nontumor skin, or papilloma and
SCC from the TPA alone, or 85 ppm arsenic plus TPA groups. Fetal skin
transcript data were from 10 to 12 individual samples randomly selected
from the control or the arsenic group from five litters per treatment group.
Tumor multiplicity and transcript levels were tested by ANOVA and
Dunnett’s test against control or by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons
test for cross-comparing treated groups. Because initial analysis of tumors
showed that no gender-based differences occurred between similarly

Incidence data (mice with three or more SCC) were compared by Fischer’s
exact test. Arsenic dose-response relationships across TPA-treated groups
(TPA alone, low arsenic plus TPA, and high arsenic plus TPA) were
determined by correlative trend tests for SCC multiplicity (Pearson
correlation) or for incidence of mice with three or more SCC (m2 test for
trend). P V 0.05 was considered significant in all cases.

Results and Discussion
Fetal arsenic exposure, skin cancer susceptibility, and
tumor aggressiveness. Pregnant Tg.AC mice received arsenic in
the drinking water from gestation days 8 to 18 at doses that
resulted in fetal blood inorganic arsenic levels similar to humans
with arsenicosis and that induced non–skin tumors in the
offspring of other mouse strains (9). The doses were well tolerated
by the dam, fetus, and neonate based on maternal water
consumption, maternal and neonatal body weights, and weight
gains of the offspring (data not shown). Although these external
doses are higher than what are typically encountered by humans
in the environment, they are nontoxic to the mice and apparently
because mice differ from humans in much more rapid clearance

of arsenic, they lead to a similar internal target tissue dosimetry
(9). After birth and weaning, the offspring received topical TPA
through adulthood to 40 weeks of age. Controls or mice given
arsenic alone developed few skin tumors whereas TPA alone
induced papillomas and SCC (Table 1). Papilloma multiplicity
(tumors/mouse) in TPA-treated mice was either not altered or
modestly reduced by prior fetal arsenic exposure. However, SCC
multiplicity and the incidence of mice with three or more SCC
were markedly increased with fetal arsenic treatment prior to
TPA in adulthood when compared with TPA alone (Table 1). Both
SCC multiplicity and mice with three or more SCC showed highly
significant arsenic dose-relationships in TPA-treated mice (via
correlative trend tests; see Table 1).
Not only were malignant tumors more frequent after fetal
arsenic prior to TPA but many showed pathologic and molecular
indications of being more aggressive. SCC induced by arsenic plus
TPA exhibited more frequent local muscle invasion (Fig. 1A),
infiltration of the dermis (Fig. 1B), and more frequent mitotic
figures (data not shown). Compared with SCC induced by TPA
alone, SCC induced by fetal arsenic plus TPA also showed more
aggressive tendencies at the molecular level, reflected in marked

increases in expression of the cell proliferation gene, cyclin D1 (Fig.
1C) and decreases in expression of the tumor suppressor gene, p16
(Fig. 1D).
In Tg.AC mice, all SCC arise from pre-existing papillomas (22),
and the larger, aggressive malignancies could incorporate/
obliterate the smaller benign lesions, potentially accounting for
fewer papillomas with the higher arsenic dose (see Table 1). Both
papillomas in mice and early lesions in arsenic-exposed human
skin involving hyperkeratosis/nodular keratosis are likely a stage
leading to more advanced epidermal proliferative lesions (11).
Indeed, evidence indicates that chemically induced papillomas
can be either of low or high risk for conversion to SCC (23, 24),
and tumors at high risk for conversion arise from carcinogenic
‘‘hits’’ within the epidermal stem cell compartment of the hair
follicle (24), likely a key locale for initial v-Ha-ras transgene
expression in Tg.AC skin carcinogenesis (17, 18). Thus, the
increase in malignant conversion to SCC in TPA-treated mice
exposed to arsenic in utero supports a stem cell origin for these
malignancies, and could also be responsible for a loss of
papillomas. Overall, fetal arsenic exposure markedly increased
high-grade malignancy response in adult Tg.AC mouse skin,
consistent with models that point towards a stem cell origin for
malignant skin tumors (25).
Tumor expression of v-Ha-ras. Tg.AC mouse studies indicate
that the levels of v-Ha-ras transgene expression dictate carcinogenic response, that KSCs are a latent neoplastic stem cell
population, and that transgene activation in KSCs is likely a
critical event in the oncogenic process (17–19). Based on the
hypothesis that fetal arsenic exposure may affect subsequent stem
cell response, v-Ha-ras expression was assessed. The v-Ha-ras
transcript levels in SCC induced by TPA treatment alone were
f4.5-fold higher than control skin but were >14-fold above
controls in SCC resulting from fetal arsenic plus TPA (Fig. 2A).
Expression of v-Ha-ras in both papillomas and SCCs was
approximately three times higher after fetal arsenic prior to TPA
exposure compared with TPA alone (Fig. 2B). Thus, fetal arsenic
with subsequent TPA caused more SCC and a hyperexpression of
v-Ha-ras to similar levels in both benign and malignant skin
tumors. Because v-Ha-ras transgene activation in skin stem cells is
very likely a critical event in Tg.AC skin carcinogenesis (17–19) its

marked overexpression in tumors induced by arsenic plus TPA
indicates that it contributed to increased tumor response.
Expression of the v-Ha-ras transgene is increased by promoter
region methylation loss (26), and arsenic can activate gene
expression via DNA hypomethylation (27). However, fetal arsenic
prior to TPA exposure did not alter levels of transgene promoter
methylation compared with TPA alone (data not shown). Given the
marked increases in v-Ha-ras transcript, this argues for more cells
overexpressing the transgene as opposed to a few cells expressing
the gene at much higher levels, and together with the marked
increases in SCC multiplicity, is consistent with an increased target
cell hypothesis. Interestingly, it is typical for arsenicosis victims to
have a great number of skin lesions, from hyperplasia to tumors,
with SCC a common malignancy (11).
Tumor expression of CD34 and Rac1 transcripts. Because
arsenic in vitro affects human epidermal stem cell population
dynamics by stalling exit into differentiation (15, 16), the
expression of several genes linked to KSC population dynamics
were studied. The expression of the specific KSC marker CD34
(18, 19) was markedly elevated in both papillomas and SCC
induced by fetal arsenic plus TPA exposure as compared with
TPA alone (Fig. 3A and B). Relative to control skin, the levels of
CD34 transcript in SCC induced by TPA alone were unchanged
but were increased >3-fold in SCC resulting from fetal arsenic
exposure plus TPA treatment (Fig. 3C). The overexpression of
CD34 in tumors induced by fetal arsenic plus TPA treatment in
adulthood is noteworthy because CD34 is a specific marker for
KSCs (19), and its expression is crucial for carcinogenesis in the
mouse skin (17, 18), pointing towards KSC as an essential target
in skin carcinogenesis (18). More importantly, very recent work
provides compelling evidence that CD34-positive tumor cells are,
in fact, CSCs for murine epidermal skin tumors, based on their
stunning potency for the initiation of secondary tumor formation
together with various other stem cell characteristics (20). Thus,
these data indicate that fetal arsenic exposure modifies stem cell
response to carcinogen exposure in adulthood, potentially
resulting in more CSCs, such that more carcinomas of higher
aggressiveness occur.
The transcript levels of Rac1, a key gene in skin stem cell
population dynamics which both stimulates KSC self-renewal and

suppresses transient-amplifying cell (TAC) production (28), were
increased >3.5-fold by prenatal arsenic treatment before TPA
exposure in both papilloma and SCC (Fig. 3A and B). Relative to
control skin, Rac1 transcript levels in SCC induced by TPA
treatment alone were elevated 300% but were >1,400% higher in
SCC resulting from prenatal arsenic exposure plus TPA treatment
in adulthood (Fig. 3C). Prior work indicates that Rac1 is
overexpressed in SCC (28), and its expression seems to be key to
the maintenance of a malignant phenotype in SCC cells in vitro
(29). Consequently, it has been hypothesized that Rac1 overexpression should induce skin hyperproliferation and, potentially,
skin cancers (28). In accord with this hypothesis, the remarkable
overexpression of Rac1 facilitated by prior fetal arsenic exposure
greatly increased chemically induced SCC formation in adulthood.
Overall, these data provides evidence of more skin stem cells
(increased CD34; refs. 17–20) and of signaling potentially increasing
stem cell production (increased Rac1; ref. 28).
The expression c-myc, which normally controls the production
of TACs under the control of Rac1 in the skin (28, 30), in SCC was
unchanged by TPA treatment regardless of prenatal arsenic
exposure (TPA alone, 100 F 20%; arsenic plus TPA, 84 F 19%).
Thus, fetal arsenic exposure enhances tumor Rac1 expression,
potentially signaling increased production of stem cells, but the
molecular signal (c-myc) dictating progression into TACs and on to
terminal differentiation (28, 30) is unaltered. This is consistent with
arsenic in vitro stalling exit of human epidermal stem cells into
differentiation pathways and supports a hypothesis that arsenic
may increase the number and/or persistence of target cells for skin
cancer initiators or promoters (15, 16).
Tumor expression of CD34 and RAC1 protein. Immunohistologic analysis strongly supports the contention that prenatal
arsenic distorted the response to subsequent TPA exposure,
including stem cell response. In this regard, advanced papillomas
with clear mesenchymal and epithelial components were assessed
for CD34-positive stem cells and RAC1 protein expression. CD34-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

positive cells occurred much more frequently in tumors induced by
fetal arsenic prior to TPA (Fig. 4A and B) compared with tumors
from TPA treatment alone (Fig. 4C), indicating a remarkable
increase in the number of stem cells (KSCs/CSCs; refs. 17–20) after
fetal arsenic. CD34 occurred intensely in the cells of the epithelial
component of the tumor. Few CD34-positive cells were seen in
tumors induced by TPA alone, which would be expected for a
tumor with a proportionately small stem cell population. Given the
compelling recent evidence that CD34 is a clear marker of CSCs in
mouse epidermal skin tumors (20), it therefore seems that prior
fetal arsenic exposure greatly increases skin tumor CSCs. SCCs
induced by arsenic plus TPA also often showed intensely positive
CD34-containing cells at the invading front (data not shown), in
keeping with recent data identifying CSCs as a primary source of
tumor invasion (20) and consistent with the more aggressive nature
of the SCC from this treatment group (see Table 1). As expected,
hair follicle bulge regions were positive for CD34 in the
surrounding normal skin (Fig. 4D) due the presence of KSCs (19).
RAC1, a key component in signaling for skin stem cell replication
and renewal as well as in negative control of TAC production (28),
was greatly increased in tumors induced by fetal arsenic prior to
TPA (Fig. 5A–C) compared with tumors induced by TPA alone
which showed minimal RAC1 (Fig. 5D). With exposure to fetal
arsenic plus TPA, RAC1 appeared most intensely on cell
membranes. In the liver, arsenic induces sustained signaling
involving hepatic endothelial Rac1 activation that markedly
increases membrane-bound levels of RAC1 protein (31). Overall,
compared with TPA alone, the tumors induced by fetal arsenic and
subsequent TPA showed more CSCs, as recently defined by CD34
positivity (20), and distorted signaling (increased RAC1) that could
lead to overproduction of stem cells (28).
Changes in fetal skin potentially relevant to epidermal
carcinogenesis. To see if changes potentially relevant to epidermal
carcinogenesis occurred as an early event, CD34, Rac1, and
v-Ha-ras transcripts were assessed in fetal skin after arsenic

exposure on gestation day 19. CD34, when compared with control
fetal skin (100 F 11%), was increased after fetal arsenic exposure
(196 F 49%, P < 0.05). Rac1 also increased after fetal arsenic
exposure (175 F 18%, P < 0.05) compared with controls (100 F
11%). Levels of the v-Ha-ras were increased by fetal arsenic
treatment (252 F 58%, P < 0.05) compared with controls (100 F
30%). These arsenic-induced changes in fetal skin mimic those seen
with arsenic facilitation of skin tumors in adulthood, and support
the hypothesis based on in vitro work that arsenic acts to
quantitatively increase stem cells as a target population as part of
its carcinogenic mode of action in skin (15, 16). Increases in CD34,
Rac1, and v-Ha-ras could foreshadow the distortion of stem cell
responsiveness and/or numbers contributing to adulthood cancer.
Staining for CD34 and Rac1 protein in fetal skin after fetal arsenic
proved inconclusive, perhaps because mature structures associated
with KSCs in mouse skin, such as hair follicles, are not yet formed
at gestation day 19 in mice.
SCC expression of genes specific to v-Ha-ras–driven skin
cancer. DSS1 is a TPA-inducible gene expressed in keratinocyte
progenitor cells influenced by v-Ha-ras that plays an important role
in skin carcinogenesis (32). DSS1 expression was significantly
increased in SCC induced in adult skin by arsenic plus TPA (12.0 F
3.0-fold above control skin) compared with TPA alone (4.1 F
0.8-fold; P < 0.05). DSS1 expression was increased f2-fold in
papilloma and f3-fold in SCC induced by fetal arsenic plus TPA

compared with TPA alone (data not shown). An early response
gene in skin hyperplasia, DSS1 overexpression is common to TPAinduced tumors, and functional analysis suggests that it is required
for epidermal cell proliferation and oncogenic transformation (32).
Thus, DSS1 overexpression after fetal arsenic exposure is consistent
with enhanced multiplicity of more aggressive skin cancers.
Other genes for which activation is specific in v-Ha-ras–driven
skin tumorigenesis in Tg.AC mice (33) were also significantly
(P < 0.05) increased in SCC induced by arsenic plus TPA including
Sprr2a (TPA alone, 8.4 F 1.3-fold over control skin; arsenic plus
TPA, 17.7 F 3.8-fold), Ptges (TPA alone, 7.5 F 1.8-fold; arsenic plus
TPA, 18.5 F 5.3-fold), and Col1a2 (TPA alone, 2.8 F 0.8-fold; arsenic
plus TPA, 17.2 F 3.9-fold). Thus, fetal arsenic exposure increased
the capacity for v-Ha-ras transgene expression resulting in an
exaggerated downstream molecular response.
Implications. Fetal arsenic exposure alone did not produce skin
tumors in the present study yet clearly increased the carcinogenic
response for high-grade malignancies. With a short biological halflife (f4 days; ref. 11), it is unlikely that large amounts of arsenic
remain to directly affect oncogenesis in adults following fetal
exposure. Thus, fetal arsenic facilitates, but on its own is
insufficient for, skin carcinogenesis via a mechanism not requiring
its own direct participation. Any mechanistic hypothesis must
account for the quiescence of fetal arsenic exposure in skin and yet
provide for the remarkable capacity to stimulate activity of other

agents given subsequently. In adult mice, although linkage to stem
cell dynamics/signaling has not been tested, inorganic arsenic
cotreatment increases both TPA- and UV-induced skin tumorigenesis, but is similarly inactive when given alone (12–14). This has led
to the concept that arsenic acts as a skin cocarcinogen (14). In this
case too, an arsenic-induced effect on adult skin stem population
dynamics or numbers might fulfill the mechanistic requirement of
arsenic dormancy alone whereas providing the basis for enhancing
the activity of other agents. Because it seems that arsenic can
quantitatively affect skin stem cells by blocking differentiation
pathways in vitro (15, 16), similar studies should be performed on
skin stem cell dynamics in in vivo models of arsenic-induced skin
cocarcinogenesis with environmentally relevant agents like UV
irradiation. In fact, earlier work with arsenic in adult Tg.AC mice
lead to the suspicion that it acted as a skin cocarcinogen/
copromoter by stimulating a pluripotent stem cell population (13).
Cancer is increasingly viewed as a stem cell disease, even in its
early stages (5, 6, 25, 34). This hypothesis conceptually involves
tumor origination from stem/progenitor cells after dysregulation of
the normally tightly regulated process of self-renewal and
differentiation (5, 6). Furthermore, cancer cells, especially CSCs,
retain stem cell–like properties, such as self-renewal, and show
differentiation often in a highly distorted fashion (5, 6). Overall,
because Rac1 seems to drive KSC replication and inhibits TAC
production (28) and CD34 is a specific marker for mouse KSCs
(18, 19) and skin epidermal CSCs (20), the present data supports

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

the notion that fetal arsenic exposure has quantitatively or
qualitatively influenced skin stem/progenitor cells in Tg.AC mice
such that a carcinogenic stimulus later in life has more target cells
and thereby results in a greatly magnified malignant tumor
response including overproduction of CSCs. Accumulating data
from various skin cancer models strongly indicate that most
tumors with high malignant potential, analogous to the SCC in the
present study, originate from the epidermal stem cell population
(20, 25). Tumors resulting from fetal arsenic plus TPA in this study
retained stem cell–like qualities and showed an increased
propensity towards malignancy and a heightened tumor aggressiveness, whereas CD34 is often overexpressed in more advanced
and aggressive SCCs (20). In addition, data from fetal skin exposed
to arsenic in utero, where expression of CD34, Rac1, and v-Ha-ras
are all increased, indicate that there are early molecular changes
relevant to stem cell dynamics and skin cancer. It is common for
CSCs to display dysregulation of self-renewal pathways (34), similar
to the overexpression of Rac1 and CD34 in the present study. Stem
cells provide a reserve of pluripotent cells able to respond to injury,
including injury by chemical insult (35). Work showing that arsenic
in vitro can ‘‘stall’’ human skin stem cell differentiation, potentially
creating additional target cells subsequent for carcinogenic
initiation or promotion (15, 16), supports this potential for arsenic
in vivo in the present study. The concept that carcinogenic stimuli
directed at tissues with more stem cells as potential targets can
lead to an intensified oncogenic response is supported by human

data from women surviving the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings,
where the most susceptible to breast cancer were those exposed
during late adolescence (5) when the mammary gland seems to
have the highest number of stem cells (36).
Conclusions. Tens of millions of people worldwide are exposed
to unhealthy environmental levels of inorganic arsenic (11),
including, for many, exposure during the fetal life stage. Emerging
data in both humans and rodents indicate that arsenic has
transplacental carcinogenic potential (9, 10). Work in mice clearly
shows that contemporaneous exposure is not necessary for arsenic
to influence the carcinogenic process in numerous internal organs,
and events in utero are sufficient to precipitate initiation or
otherwise increase sensitivity to carcinogenesis stimulated by other
agents later in life (9). In keeping with these studies, the present
work shows in utero arsenic exposure, although by itself oncogenically quiescent, clearly facilitated skin cancer, possibly via
distortion in stem cell response. The general concept that fetal
toxicant exposure could be dormant and yet affect the development of cancer by altering the response to a chemical insult
occurring much later in life could have broad implications in
