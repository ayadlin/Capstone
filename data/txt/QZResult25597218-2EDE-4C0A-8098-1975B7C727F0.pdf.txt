ABSTRACT:
Effective treatment as well as prognostic biomarker for malignant esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is urgently needed. The present study was aimed
at identifying oncogenic genes involving dysregulated intracellular Ca2+ signaling,
which is known to function importantly in cellular proliferation and migration. Tumors
from patients with ESCC were found to display elevated expression of Orai1, a storeoperated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) channel, and the high expression of Orai1 was associated
with poor overall and recurrence-free survival. In contrast to the quiescent nature of
non-tumorigenic epithelial cells, human ESCC cells exhibited strikingly hyperactive in
intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, which were sensitive to treatments with Orai1 channel
blockers and to orai1 silencing. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of Orai1 activity
or reduction of Orai1 expression suppressed proliferation and migration of ESCC in
vitro and slowed tumor formation and growth in in vivo xenografted mice. Combined,
these findings provide the first evidence to imply Orai1 as a novel biomarker for ESCC
prognostic stratification and also highlight Orai1-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway as
a potential target for treatment of this deadly disease.

INTRODUCTION

suffering from ESCC are diagnosed at advanced stages
of the disease, the 5-year survival rate is poor (19%) and
currently represents the fourth poorest among all forms
of cancer[2]. Identification of biomarkers for early
detection, prognostic stratification, and novel therapeutic
interventions are therefore urgently needed for effective
management of ESCC.
One emerging exciting area in cancer research
is exploration of intracellular Ca2+ signaling pathways

Esophageal cancer is the 6th leading cause of
human cancer death worldwide[1]. Whereas esophageal
adenocarcinoma is the main form of esophageal cancer in
the United States and other western countries, esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for more than
90% of esophageal cancer cases in such countries as
Japan, China, Mongolia and Iran. Because most patients

toward characterization of the molecular mechanisms
underlying carcinogenesis and tumor progression.
Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) are
well established to influence diverse downstream cellular
processes including gene transcription, cell proliferation
and migration [3]. In particular, a large body of evidence
supports the contribution of altered Ca2+ signaling to tumor
angiogenesis, progression and metastasis and favors the
possibility that genes contributing to such alterations
represent novel targets for cancer therapy. Spatiallytemporally confined Ca2+ signaling is highly regulated in
the form of waves, spikes or oscillations [4]. The latter
is a remarkable process since its frequency, amplitude
and duration can serve as a “calcium code” to activate
transcription factors associated with cellular responses
to environmental changes [5]. Oscillations in [Ca2+]i are
coordinated with the release of Ca2+ through the InsP3
receptor present on internal Ca2+ storage sites such as the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), with the accumulation of
Ca2+ by the ER, and with Ca2+ influx from extracellular
Ca2+ reservoirs. The last of these processes is governed
mainly by a process termed store-operated Ca2+ entry
(SOCE) [6].
The functional unit of SOCE is currently thought to
be comprised of at least two molecular components: Orai1,
a Ca2+ channel located at the plasma membrane (PM) [7,
8], and STIM1, a Ca2+ sensor located at the ER [9, 10].
Upon depletion of ER Ca2+ stores, STIM1 molecules
cluster at the ER/PM junction such that a retrograde
signal is sent to Orai1 for channel opening [11]. Defects
in SOCE resulting from genetic mutations in Orail1 or
STIM1 have been linked to several human diseases [12],
e.g. severe combined immunodeficiency. Furthermore,
reduction of STIM1 and/or Orai1 expression by gene
silencing techniques decreases growth and metastasis of
breast and cervical tumors in mice [13, 14]. Additionally,
SOCE has been found to participate the transition from
androgen-dependent to androgen-independent stage
in prostate cancer [15, 16]. The pathophysiological
role of SOCE in tumor growth is further demonstrated
by findings with pharmacologic agents. For example,
carboxyamidotriazole, a novel anti-cancer drug currently
in clinical trials, targets a non-voltage-gated Ca2+ channel
presumed to be Orai1 [17]. Established SOCE blockers,
such as skf-96365 and 2-aminoethyl diphenylborate (2APB), suppress proliferation of various types of cancer
cells [13, 18, 19]. While SOCE has been shown to play an
essential role in various cancers, the exact contributions
of expression of genes underpinning the SOCE machinery
to carcinogenesis and tumor progression remains
contradictory and the relevance of Orai1 per se to ESCC
in patients are unknown.
The present study was undertaken to reveal the
expression profile of SOCE machinery genes in tumor
tissues from patients with ESCC and more importantly to
explore the clinical significance of Orai1 in esophageal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer. Using human non-tumorigenic esophageal
epithelial and ESCC cell lines, we revealed the alteration
in SOCE and intracellular Ca2+ signaling in the progression
of ESCC. Lastly, we performed functional analysis on
Orai1 in ESCC with in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our
attempt is to identify any abnormity in SOCE to be used
as diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker and to provide
insights to mechanistic understanding on how such
abnormity in SOCE pathway regulates tumor progression.

RESULTS
Elevated expression of Orai1 in tumor tissues
removed from patients with ESCC
Primary tumor specimens and neighboring normal
esophageal epithelial tissues were excised from patients
with ESCC according to procedures described previously
[20]. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis
revealed that stim1 and orai1 were expressed abundantly
in esophageal tumor tissues, but that their homologues
(stim2, orai2 and orai3) were less abundant in these tissues
(not shown). The major components of SOCE machinery,
Orai1 and STIM1, therefore served as the focus for this
present study. Values for orai1 mRNA in ESCC tumors
were 256% of those for paired neighboring normal tissues
(Supplementary Fig. S1A, n=12, p<0.01). Consistent with
these observations, Western blot analyses revealed that
Orai1 was expressed to significantly higher degrees in
ESCC tumors as compared to normal tissues (Fig. 1A).
Based on densitometric findings from 34 paired samples,
tumor Orai1 values were always greater than those for
paired normal neighboring tissues and the change was
more than one fold (Fig. 1B, p<0.01; Table S1, 23 pairs).
In contrast to previously observed increases in STIM1
expression in cervical cancer [14], expression of STIM1
in ESCC tumor tissues did not differ statistically from that
in normal esophageal epithelial tissues, and stim1 mRNA
was found to be even reduced in ESCC tumor tissues (Fig.
1C and Supplementary Fig. S1A). The upregulation of
Orai1 expression in ESCC tumors was further confirmed
by immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of human ESCC
specimens (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S2.A and B).
IHC findings also confirmed localization of Orai1 to the
PM in esophageal epithelial tissues. In 72 of 82 paired
samples (88%), Orai1 expression was clearly higher in
tumor tissues than in neighboring normal tissues. Mean
IHC scores for Orai1 in tumors and neighboring normal
tissues were 4.8 and 0.7, respectively, showing statistical
significant difference (Fig.1E, p<0.001).

Correlation of Orai1 expression with
clinicopathological features and prognosis for
patients with ESCC

revealed that high expression of Orai1 was positively
correlated with histological grade (p=0.019), T stage
classification (p=0.029), lymph node metastasis (p=0.010)
and advanced clinical staging (p=0.012). No correlation
was observed between Orai1 expression and other factors
such as age, gender, tumor size and location.
Survival data were gathered and analyzed from 82
patients for whom samples of both tumor and neighboring
normal tissue were available. Among them, 79 (96%)
patients died during follow-up. After examining each
variable separately for association with survival status,

Next, the association between Orai1 expression
and clinicopathological features in patients with ESCC
was examined. Carcinoma specimens were divided into
two groups: those with high and those with low Orai1
expression according to IHC scores using a cut-off value
of 4 (the median value). Multivariate analysis (Table 1)

the association between Orai1 expression and survival
was analyzed (Fig. 1F and Supplementary Table S2).
Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed correlations
between high Orai1 expression and poor overall survival
and between high Orai1 expression and recurrence-free
survival with statistical significance for both correlations
(Fig. 1F, p<0.01). The statistical significance of these
correlations was retained with adjustments for several
clinical parameters including age, gender, tumor size,
tumor grade, lymph node status, T classification and
advanced stage (Supplementary Table S2). Using Cox’s
proportional hazards model, the relative risks (RR) of
high Orai1 expression were calculated as 2.683 for overall

survival and 2.752 for recurrence-free survival whereas
the corresponding RRs of lymph node status N were
calculated to be 1.647 for overall survival and 1.604 for
disease-free survival (Supplementary Table S3).

Orai1 expression and SOCE channel activity in
ESCC and non-tumorigenic epithelial cells
It is well documented that both STIM1 and Orai1
are required for function of SOCE and STIM1 was
particularly reported to participate in tumor growth
and metastasis in cervical cancer [14]. To elucidate the

to trigger Mn2+ influx through SOCE. Triton X-100 (0.1%, double arrows) was added to permeabilize the cells at the end of protocol. The
slope for changes in Fura-2 fluorescence with time was significantly shallower for HET-1A (blue trace) than for KYSE-150 cells (red trace).

intriguing function of upregulated Orai1 but not STIM1
in esophageal cancer, the Orai1-mediated SOCE activity
were examined in epithelial cell lines derived from human
ESCC tumors: KYSE-150, KYSE-190, KYSE-30, KYSE510 and KYSE-790. Among them, KYSE-150 and KYSE30 cells have been found highly tumorigenic based on in
vitro agar assays and in vivo tests in nude mice [21]. Two
human non-tumorigenic epithelial cell lines (HET-1A,
originated from esophagus and INT407, originated from
intestine) were included as control [22]. Consistent with
findings for human ESCC tumors, expression of Orai1
was found by western blot and quantitative real-time RTPCR analysis to be elevated in ESCC cells as compared to
non-tumorigenic control cells (Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Fig. S1B). By contrast, STIM1 was expressed to similar
degrees in all non-tumorigenic and cancer cell lines tested
(Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S1B). SOCE activity in
these cell lines were then examined using a fluorescent
Ca2+ indicator Fura-2. As shown in Fig. 2B, treatment of
5 µM thapsigargin (TG), an ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor,
resulted in a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i, consistent with depletion
of ER Ca2+ stores. Subsequent addition of 2 mM CaCl2 to
the extracellular bath solution triggered another increase in

[Ca2+]i, consistent with Ca2+ influx from the extracellular
solution. This event was considered to be attributable to
SOCE since an increase was not observed in the presence
of skf-96365 (20 μM, not shown), 2-APB (50 μM, not
shown) or BTP-2 (1 μM, gray trace of right panel), which
are all known SOCE blockers. ∆F350/F385 was calculated to
represent the activity of SOCE and the findings showed
that SOCE was about twice active in KYSE-150 cells than
that in HET-1A cells (Fig. 2B and C). It is worth to note
that the expression of STIM1 at a lower level appeared
to be still sufficient to support the SOCE activity since
knockdown of STIM1 to about one third of original level
failed to have impact on SOCE influx (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Whereas the basal [Ca2+]i showed no significant
difference in HET-1A and ESCC cells, the ER Ca2+ stores
appeared to be significantly less in the former than in the
later (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). Interestingly, the
expression level of STIM2 was upregulated in ESCC cells
compared with that in HET-1A cells (Supplementary Fig.
S4C), which is consistent with the previous reports that
STIM2, but not STIM1, regulates basal cytosolic and ER
Ca2+ levels[23].
Additional Mn-quenching assay was used to

compare SOCE activity in HET-1A and ESCC cell
lines. Time-dependent quenching of intracellular Fura-2
fluorescence in response to entry of Mn2+ via the SOCE
mechanism represents a quantitative measure for Orai1
channel activity: the steeper the decline in slope, the
greater the channel activity[24, 25]. Compared to that
in HET-1A cells (Fig. 2D, blue trace), SOCE activity in
KYSE-150 cells (red trace) was significantly increased;
the activity in KYSE-150 cells was almost completely
eliminated in the presence of 2-APB (50 μM, black trace).
Analyses of Mn2+ quenching slopes indicated that SOCE
activities for all ESCC cells examined were significantly
higher than that for HET-1A cells; relative activities were:
KYSE-150 > KYSE-30 > KYSE-510 > HET-1A cells
(Fig. 2E, p<0.05).

shRNA-1 and shRNA-2 were verified to be specific
against the orai1 gene with no off-target effects since the
expression of other Ca2+ signaling proteins, i.e. STIM1,
SERCA2 and the Na+ -Ca2+ exchanger (NCX3) were not
affected (Supplementary Fig. S5). SOCE activity was then
examined as a function of knockdown of Orai1 expression.
Treatment with thapsigargin (5 µM) in the presence of
EGTA resulted in comparable rapid increases in [Ca2+]
in both shRNA-transfected and in non-transfected
i
control cells; subsequent addition of 2 mM Ca2+ to the
medium triggered a second increase in both preparations
but a lesser increase was observed in the transfected
preparations (Fig. 4D). Following transfection of KYSE150 cells with shRNA but not with plasmid containing
the scrambled sequence, SOCE activity (∆F350/F385) was
reduced to almost half of that observed in parental cells
(Fig. 4E). Intracellular Ca2+ signaling as shown in timelapse imaging was also significantly reduced in KYSE150 cells transfected with shRNA (Fig. 4, F and G as
compared to Fig. 3, A and B, lower panels); less than 40%
of these cells exhibited intracellular Ca2+ oscillations (Fig.
4H, p<0.01). Skf-96365 treatment resulted in almost full
suppression of these oscillations, which were present in
~76% of untreated KYSE-150 cells as compared to ~26%
of HET-1 cells (Fig. 4H).

Hyperactivity of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations in
ESCC cells
To evaluate the impact of increased SOCE on overall
intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in ESCC cells, time-lapse
imaging was employed using live cells loaded with Fluo4 AM and maintained in culture medium without phenol
red at 37oC and in the presence of 5% CO2. Whereas HET1A cells displayed silent nature of Ca2+ signaling (Fig.
3 A and B, upper panels and Supplementary Video 1),
KYSE-150 cells, interestingly, exhibited spontaneous and
prominent intracellular Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 3A and B,
lower panels; Supplementary Video 2). The oscillations
displayed in sinusoidal form with a frequency of ~0.024
Hz. Within 10 min of recording time, more than 76% of
KYSE-150 cells exhibited spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations
whereas only 26% of HET-1A cells displayed comparable
events (Fig. 3C).
The presence of SOCE inhibitors skf-96365 (20 μM)
or 2-APB (50 μM) completely abolished these intracellular
Ca2+ oscillations in KYSE-150 cells (Fig 4, A and B, and
Supplementary Video 3). Addition of Ca2+ chelator EGTA
(0.5mM) also silenced these oscillations as well.
Evidence that Orai1 is responsible for the
spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ oscillations displayed
in KYSE-150 cells was sought. Several shRNA probes
specifically targeting the human orai1 gene were designed
and constructed into the pRiR plasmid, which contains
a gene encoding red fluorescent protein (RFP) as a
convenient reporter[26]. Transfection with two of these
constructs, termed shRNA-1 and shRNA-2, knocked
down Orai1 expression in KYSE-150 cells effectively,
with ~80% reduction (Fig. 4C). Transfection of pRiR
plasmid containing a scrambled shRNA sequence did not
change Orai1 expression from that observed in parent
cells. This finding indicated that the observed gene
silencing effect was not attributable to transfection with
plasmid alone and supported use of plasmid containing
scrambled sequence as an appropriate control. Both

Suppressed cell proliferation, migration and
invasion by knockdown of Orai1
Intracellular Ca2+ oscillations are thought to
stimulate proliferation of lymphocytes through activation
of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway and
to promote a variety of other events in cancer cells [27,
28]. However, NFAT was not detected in ESCC cells even
after treatment of cyclosporine A to enhance the nuclear
translocation of NFAT (not shown). On the other hand,
phosphorylated ERK (p44/42) and pAKT (T308) were
elevated in KYSE-150 cells compared with those in HET1A cells and knocking down of Orai1 resulted in decreased
phosphorylation forms of ERK and AKT (Supplementary
Fig. S6A). The transcription factor MEF2D, a recently
identified oncogene in leukemia and liver cancer[29],
appeared to be more abundant in ESCC cells than in HET1A cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B). Such data indicated
that ERK, AKT and MEF2D pathways might be the
transcription factors involving in Orai1-intracellular Ca2+
oscillations-stimulated signaling cascades in ESCC cells.
The cell proliferation in these cell lines was then
compared using MTT assay. The growth of KYSE-150
cells was much faster than that of HET-1A cells, with
doubling times of 22.3h comparing 93.5h for the latter
(Fig. 5A). Knockdown of Orai1 significantly reduced
cell proliferation and increased doubling times (40.3h
for shRNA-1 and 54.7h for shRNA-2). Similar results
of reduced cell proliferation by reduction of Orai1 were

cells transfected with scrambled shRNA (Fig. 5B & C),
indicating delayed G1 to S transition and enhanced G2 to
S transition of cell cycle. Next, the changes in several cell
cycle related proteins that are known involved in ESCC,
were examined. The results shown that knockdown of
Orai1 did not change the expression of p53, but resulted
in upregulation of cdc2, Cyclin B1 and p27, whereas
transfection of scramble shRNA had no effects (Fig. 5D).
Given that the G1 to S phase transition is controlled by
p27 through inhibition of Cyclin E-CDK2 complex and
G2 to M phase transition is governed by cdc2-Cyclin B
complex, the Western blot results were consistent with the
cell cycle distribution.
The effects of decreased Orai1 expression on ESCC
migration and invasion were examined using KYSE30 cells, a commonly employed metastatic model. The
wound-healing assay was selected to measure directional
cell migration in vitro. Cells were grown to confluence
and a ‘‘wound’’ was placed in the middle of the culture
plate with a pipette tip. In the absence of serum, parental

cells or cells transfected with scrambled shRNA migrated
and filled the gap after 24h (Fig.5D, upper panels); by
contrast, cells transfected with shRNA-1 or shRNA-2
failed to fill the gap (Fig.5D, lower panels). The Boyden
chamber assay was employed to confirm these findings.
This assay permits cells to migrate through an 8 µmpore membrane at the bottom of the chamber; cells that
have migrated through the pore are visualized by crystal
violet staining. As shown in Fig. 5, E and F, fewer stained
cells were observed following transfection of the cells
with shRNA-1 or shRNA-2 as compared to parental cells
or those transfected with the scrambled sequence. The
number of migratory cells was decreased by approximately
half as a consequence of transfection with shRNA-1 or
shRNA-2 but not as a consequence of transfection with the
scrambled sequence (Fig. 5F).
The cell invasion was then examined using the same
Boyden chamber system but with a coating of extracellular
Matrigel applied to cover the membrane. Cells that invaded
the matrix were fixed and stained with propidium iodide.
Fewer stained cells were observed following transfection
of the cells with shRNA or shRNA-2 as compared to
parental cells or those transfected with the scrambled
sequence (Fig. 5G), and the number of invasive cells
was decreased by approximately 70% as a consequence

of transfection with shRNA-1 or shRNA-2 but not as a
consequence of transfection with the scrambled sequence
(Fig. 5H).
It was considered of importance to ascertain
whether knockdown of Orai1 affected the expression
of proteins involved in migration and invasion. To
this end, three proteins central to these processes were
selected [30]. Vimentin, an intermediate filament protein,
is an important marker of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition and a requisite regulator of mesenchymal cell
migration. E-cadherin function is frequently lost during
tumor progression and the transition to a more motile and
invasive phenotype. Rac1, a key GTPase, facilitates cell
migration in esophageal cancer cells. Transfection with
shRNA-1 or shRNA-2, but not with scrambled sequence,
resulted in decreased expression of vimentin and Rac1 and
up-regulation of E-cadherin (Fig. 5I).

reveal an oncogenic role for Orai1 in esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma, a major cause of cancer death worldwide.
Compared with that in neighboring non-tumorous
esophageal tissues, expression of Orai1 in tumors
obtained from patients with ESCC was significantly
elevated (Figs. 1A, 1B and 1D). High Orai1 expression
was strongly associated with the recurrence rate for this
disease independently of other variables and using either
overall survival or recurrence-free survival as the endpoint
(Fig. 1F and Table S2 and S3). In cultured epithelial
cells derived from ESCC patients, strikingly hyperactive
intracellular Ca2+ oscillations were observed (Fig. 3);
reduction of Orail1 function using either pharmacologic
or molecular approaches suppressed these oscillations
(Fig. 4) indicating that they were mediated by Orai1
channel activity. Moreover, inhibition of Orai1-mediated
SOCE by pharmacologic antagonists of the channel
or reduction of Orai1 expression by orai1 knockdown
impeded the proliferation and migration of ESCC cells in
culture, reduced their capacity for invasion, and altered
their expression of proteins intimately concerned with
migration and invasion (Figs. 5). Finally, inhibition of
Orai1-mediated SOCE by pharmacological antagonists
of channel activity or reduction of Orai1 expression in
ESCC cells via orai1 knockdown suppressed the growth
of human ESCC tumors in xenografted nude mice (Fig.6).
As such, this present study provides the first evidence, to
our knowledge, in support of an association between Orai1
expression and the clinical outcome of cancer patients
and the hyperactivity of Orai1-SOCE-intracellular Ca2+
oscillations pathway in cancer cells.
Similar molecular and pharmacologic approaches
employed in this study have been utilized by other
investigators to evaluate the importance of STIM1 to the
migration and metastasis of breast and cervical cancers.
For example, STIM1 was reported to promote cell
proliferation and migration, to favor the development
of angiogenesis in cervical cancer, and to enhance focal
adhesion turnover in breast cancer cells [13, 14, 31]. Chen
et al, who examined tumor tissues from subjects with
early-stage cervical cancer, observed that STIM1 was
overexpressed in 71% of these tissues [14]. In the present
study, however, expression of STIM1 in tumor tissues from
patients with ESCC either did not differ or was reduced as
compared to that in neighboring normal esophageal tissues
(Fig. 1, A and C). These contradictory findings imply
tissue and cancer stage variations in the features of SOCE
and/or in the expression of the components of SOCE
machinery. Findings from other independent studies
are cited here to support this hypothesis. Firstly, downregulation of SOCE activation and reduction of Orai1
expression were observed by this laboratory and others
in prostate cancer cells representing advanced stage [15,
16]. Secondly, Feng et al. identified a signaling pathway
in which formation of an Orai1-SPCA2 complex elicits
constitutive store-independent Ca2+ signaling and promotes

Prevented tumor growth by blocking SOCE or
knockdown Orai1 in vivo
Studies of Orai1 function in cultured ESCC
cells were extended to a xenograft animal model. After
subcutaneous inoculation of KYSE-150 cells into NCr nu/
nu nude mice (5-6 weeks of age), solid tumors formed
rapidly (Fig 6, A-D). By contrast, no visible tumor
masses were observed throughout the 12 weeks following
inoculations with HET-1A cells (Fig 6, C). Intraperitoneal
injection of skf-96365 (10 µg/g body weight) every other
day for 2 weeks significantly retarded tumor growth (Fig.
6, A and B; n = 8, p <0.01). The application of skf-96365
at this dose daily for up to two weeks appeared to be safe
for these animals since no obvious abnormality or body
weight was observed (not shown).
It was considered essential to verify that the
high expression of Orai1 displayed by ESCC cells was
important for their ability to produce rapidly-growing
tumors in these animals. To this end, the nude mice were
subcutaneously inoculated with same number of KYSE150 control cells or cells stably expressing shRNA-2;
volumes of tumors generated in these xenograft mice
were then measured over 4-6 weeks. As shown in Fig. 6,
C and D, volumes of tumors generated from KYSE-150
cells containing shRNA-2 were significantly smaller than
volumes of tumors generated from non-transfected KYSE150 cells. Furthermore, at 6 weeks following inoculations,
3 out of 8 animals inoculated with KYSE-150 cells
containing shRNA-2 failed to show a visible tumor. These
findings clearly demonstrated that the reduction of Orai1
expression inhibited ESCC tumor growth in xenograft
nude mice.

tumorigenesis in breast cancer[32]. Thirdly, the native
SOCE pathway was found to be mediated by Orai3 in
estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells whereas the
canonical STIM1/Orai1 pathway was shown to be used by
estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells[33]. Lastly,
Chantome et al. found that knockdown of STIM1 had no
effect whereas knockdown of Orai1 inhibited migration
of breast cancer cells, indicating STIM1 might not be
involved in the metastatic process[34]. The observation of
significant higher expression of STIM2 in ESCC cell lines
than that in HET-1A cells implies that STIM2 may play an
important role in regulation of Orai1 channel activity and
overall intracellular Ca2+ signaling in this type of cancer.
Further investigations of expression of the components of
the SOCE machinery and of the functions of the channel
during carcinogenesis and tumorigenesis are needed
to define the mechanisms through which the process of
SOCE is regulated in different cancers.
A proper stoichiometric ratio of Orai1 to STIM1
is required for optimal SOCE function. Overexpression
of Orai1 alone has been found to decrease SOCE in
some cell types including HEK-293, HeLa and A549
[35]. Recent crystallization study revealed a hexametric
structure for the functional Orai channel through coupling
with STIM1[36], and provided evidence to support the
model that the optimal Orai1/STIM1 for maximal SOCE
activation is 2:1[37]. However, variations in the ratios
of Orai1 expression to STIM1 expression and in the
functional properties of SOCE are reported for different
cell types[38]. Any perturbation in the stoichiometry
may have significant consequence on SOCE properties
and intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, and likely tumor
progression. Any perturbation in stoichiometry may have
significant consequences for the properties of the channel,
for the manifestation of intracellular Ca2+ oscillations,
and for tumor progression. An unexpected finding in
the present study was the observed increase in Orai1
expression with no increase in STIM1 expression in
ESCC tumor tissues (Fig. 1, A-C and Fig. S1). In addition,
knockdown of STIM1 in KYSE-150 cells appeared
to have no effect on SOCE activity (Supplementary
Fig. S3). These findings support two possibilities: 1)
the expression of STIM1 is so abundant in esophageal
epithelial cells and thus it is sufficient to cope with the
regulatory needs even in the case of significant elevated
expression of Orai1 in esophageal cancer cells; 2) STIM1
is not sufficient to support the regulatory needs so that
some Orai1 channels may escape coupling with STIM1.
Further studies will warrant the differentiation of the two
mechanisms. While the present report is in preparation,
Wang et al identified distinct Orai1-coupling domains
in STIM1 and STIM2, which determines the efficacy of
coupling between STIM2 and Orai1 as well as whether it
contains store-dependent agonist properties[39]. And our
data showed that the expression of STIM2 was elevated in
ESCC cells compared to that in HET-1A cells. It applauses
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the possibility that STIM2 may replace STIM1 to couple
with Orai1 in cancer cells. Clearly, more studies are
urgent to address these following important questions: 1)
is uncoupling regulated in response to different cellular
requirements in cancer cells and how does regulation
occur? 2) are additional factors required for coupling of
STIMs with Orai1 and/or for regulation of Orai1 channel
gating in ESCC as compared to normal esophageal
epithelial cells? 3) does Orai1-STIM2 complex control
intracellular Ca2+ oscillations and tumor progression in
ESCC?
Intracellular Ca2+ oscillations are recognized to serve
as “calcium code” to initiate many biological processes,
such as T-cell proliferation[27]. However, the mechanisms
through which oscillatory changes in [Ca2+]i are initiated in
various cancer cells remain to be defined. It is worthwhile
to note that the remarkable prominent intracellular Ca2+
oscillations observed in the present study in ESCC cells
was recorded for cells in culture medium containing fetal
bovine serum (5%) Under this condition, growth factors
capable of binding to their specific receptors to stimulate
InsP3 receptor-dependent release of Ca2+ from the ER
were present. Such growth factors may generate partial
depletion in ER Ca2+ stores and have promoted activation
of SOCE in this study. It is interesting to speculate that a
particular growth factor receptor is abundantly expressed,
or even over-expressed, in ESCC cells and that occupation
of this receptor mediated optimal activation of SOCE. For
example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has
been reported to be overexpressed in many cancer cells
including ESCC[40]. Activation of this receptor by EGF,
by angiotensin II, or by endothelin-1 is known to evoke
Ca2+ release from ER Ca2+ stores. Whether occupation of
the EGFR by an appropriate agonist serves to promote
full SOCE activation with amplified intracellular Ca2+
oscillations in cultured ESCC cells remains to be shown.
Further studies of the mechanisms through which the
Orai1 channel of cultured ESCC cells is activated are
warranted in order to approach an understanding of the
nature of ESCC tumor growth in vivo.
In summary, this study demonstrated that tumor
tissues from patients with ESCC express Orai1 at high
concentrations; expression of the channel correlates
closely with the recurrence rate for this disease
independently of other factors. Orai1 is therefore proposed
as an effective biomarker of the prognosis for patients with
this form of cancer. A salient property of isolated human
ESCC cells is their capacity to exhibit prominent and
spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ oscillations which depend
on Orai1-mediated SOCE. More importantly, evidence
provided in this report supports the proposal that increased
Orai1-SOCE-intracellular Ca2+ oscillations serve to signal
activation of downstream pathways that stimulate the
proliferation and migration of ESCC cells, enhance their
capacity to invade other tissues, and promote ESCC tumor
formation and growth in vitro and in vivo. Findings of this

mechanisms underlying the regulation of Orai1 channels
in cancer cells and thereby serve to identify targets for
novel therapeutic treatments of esophageal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue specimens
All protocols concerning human subjects were
approved by the Regional Ethical Committee of Sun YatSen University, and all investigations with human subjects
were conducted after informed consent was obtained.
Primary tumors and their neighboring non-tumorous
tissues were obtained from 82 patients with ESCC, each of
whom underwent surgical resection without preoperative
systemic chemotherapy at the Cancer Center of Sun YatSen University. The specimens were collected immediately
after surgical removal and fixed with 10% formalin
followed by paraffin-embedding. Clinical information
was obtained from pathology reports and is summarized
in Table S2 and Table 1. The median follow-up period
was 25 months (range: 1–96months). Tumor histology
confirmed that all specimens were ESCC and that 53 of 82
(64.6%) tumors originated in the thorax. For Western blot
and quantitative RT-PCR expression studies, 34 pairs of
fresh samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately
after surgical removal and maintained at -80oC until use.

Immunohistochemistry and scoring of Orai1
expression in human tumor tissues

Cell lines and cell culture

Paraffin-embedded, formalin fixed esophageal
cancer tissue sections (4 µm in thick) were deparaffinized
with xylene and rehydrated in ethanol. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) for 30 min at room temperature. Antigen
retrieval was performed by pressure cooking sections for 3
min in buffered EDTA solution (pH = 8.0). Sections were
treated with 10% normal goat serum at room temperature
for 30 min to reduce nonspecific reactions. Antibody
against human Orai1 (1:100) was then applied and
samples were stored at 4°C overnight in a moist chamber.
Samples were treated with secondary antibody (Envision;
Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h at room temperature
and stained with DAB (3,3-diaminobenzidine). Finally, the
sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin,
dehydrated, and mounted. A negative control was obtained
by replacing the primary antibody with a normal murine
IgG. The number of positively stained cells was averaged
by two independent investigators using microscopy.
Stained cell proportions were scored as follows: 0
(no stained cell); 1 (10–25% positively stained cells); 2
(26–50% positively stained cells); 3 (51–100% positively
stained cells). Staining intensity was graded according to
the following standard: 0 (no staining); 1 (weak staining=

HET-1A cells were maintained in serum-free LHC9 medium whereas KYSE-150, KYSE-30, KYSE-510,
KYSE-790 and other ESCC cell lines were cultured in
RPMI-1640/Ham’s F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with
5% FBS[20]. All cell lines were cultured in the presence
of 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37oC in a humidified 5%
CO2 incubator. HET-1A cells were cultured with RPMI1640/Ham’s F12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 5%
FBS for 7 days prior to initiating experiments.

Plasmids and shRNAs
Multiple short hairpin RNA (shRNA) probes
targeting the human orai1 gene and a probe containing
a scrambled sequence (control) were designed and
constructed into a pU6-mRFP expression vector as
described previously [26]. Two shRNA Orai1 probes,
one containing the sequence 5’-cgtgcacaatctcaactcg-3′
in the coding region, and another with the sequence 5’gcactttgaaactgtcctcta-3’ in the 3’-UTR region, were
verified by Western blot analysis to be effective in
silencing the orai1 gene.

receptor score. The median value of IHC scores was 4;
therefore low and high expression was set at scores of <4

Mn2+ influx through SOCE. At the end of each experiment,
Triton X-100 (0.1%) was added to permeabilize the cells
for normalization. The slope of changes in normalized
Fura-2 fluorescence versus time was calculated as the
fluorescence decrease in %/sec.
To record intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, cells
cultured in 96-well imaging plates (BD Falcon, NJ)
were loaded with Fluo-4-AM (3 M) for 20 min at 37oC
in culture medium without serum. After removal of the
fluorescent dye, intracellular fluorescence was monitored
under a 20X objective (NA 0.75) using the BD Pathway
855 BioImager system at 37oC in the presence of 5% CO2
and normal culture medium without phenol red. Timelapse live cell imaging was recorded and findings were
analyzed using either BD Pathway software or ImageJ.

Measurement of cell proliferation and cell cycle
distribution
Cell proliferation was examined using the standard
MTT assay. Cells were seeded at a density of 400 per
well in growth medium in 96-well plates and incubated
for varying time periods. The number of viable cells at
each incubation time was determined by the absorbance
of water-insoluble formazan at 570nm using a FlexStation
3 (Molecular Devices, CA).
Flow cytometric analysis was performed with cells
that had been seeded at a density of 3×105/well in 6-well
plates and then cultured for 72 h in growth medium.
Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol/10% PBS treated with
50 μg/ml DNase-free RNase; stained for 30 min at 37
°C with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in 0.1% sodium
citrate containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and subject to flow
cytometry using a FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter, USA). CellQuest software (BD Biosciences) was
used to determine the percentages of cells in the G0/G1, S,
and G2/M phases.

Cell migration and cellular invasion assays
KYSE-30 cells cultured to confluence in 6-well
plates were depleted of serum for 12 h. A wound was
then placed by scraping a conventional pipette tip across
the monolayer, followed by three washes with PBS. Cell
migration and wound closure images were obtained by
photography at 0, 12 or 24 h after wounding. Experiments
were carried out in triplicate, and identical findings were
obtained on at least three occasions.
Alternatively, cell migration was also examined
in Boyden chamber system. KYSE-30 cells (5×104)
suspended in serum-free medium were added to the upper
chamber (6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore size, Corning),
and the chamber was placed in 24-well dishes. Migration
was permitted for 24 h, and cells were then fixed with 4%
formaldehyde. Cells that had migrated were stained with
crystal violet, and non-migrating cells on upper side of the
insert were removed with a cotton swab. Three randomly
selected fields (10× objective) were viewed by microscopy
and relative migration was determined as the average
number of stained cells per field.
Cell invasion assays were conducted using a Boyden
chamber but with Matrigel-coated invasion inserts (BD
Biosciences, 8 µm pore membranes) placed according to
the manufacture’s instructions. Transmigrating cells on the
underside of the inserts were fixed with 4% formaldehyde
and stained with propidium iodide. Fluorescent images of
three random fields were acquired the average number of
cells per field was calculated and is presented as relative
invasion.

Measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration
and SOCE
Cultured cells were loaded with 5µM Fura-2
acetoxymethyl ester (Invitrogen, OR) for 45  min at 37
o
C following a previously published procedure [25].
[Ca2+]i was monitored by fluorescence microscopy
with a 40x objective (Nikon TE200 Super Fluo, N.A.
1.3) in a dual-wavelength spectrofluorometer (Photon
Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ). The
dual excitation wavelengths were 350nm and 385 nm,
respectively; the emission wavelength was 510  nm.
ER Ca2+ stores were depleted by treatment with 5 µM
thapsigargin in BSS solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 2.8
KCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2) containing 0.5 mM
EGTA. Ca2+ entry was accomplished by addition of
CaCl2 (2mM). SOCE activity is presented as ΔF350/F385,
the difference between basal and maximal values of
F350/F385 after addition of 2mM CaCl2 in BSS solution.
Alternatively, SOCE was measured through use of Mn2+
quenching assay[25], which is based on measurement
of the fluorescence of fura-2 at a Ca2+ concentrationinsensitive isosbestic point (F360nm). Briefly, KYSE-150
or HET-1A cells (1x106) were placed in quartz cuvettes
and pretreated with thapsigargin (5µM) in BSS to deplete
ER Ca2+ stores. Addition of MnCl2 (0.5 mM) promoted

Animal care and experiments were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee
(IACUC). In total, 1 x 106 cells in 100µL PBS were
mixed with an equal volume of Matrigel (BD Bioscience,
San Jose, CA) and then subcutaneously injected into the
3468

Oncotarget

backs of male NCr nu/nu nude mice (Taconic Farm, NY).
For the pharmacological study, total 16 inoculated mice
were randomly assigned to two groups with each group
containing 8 animals: control and treatment groups.
One week after inoculation at that time the tumors were
already visible in all animals, the treatment group received
intraperitoneal injection of skf-96365 (10 µg/g body
weight) every other day for 2 weeks. The control animals
were injected with same amount of PBS containing same
concentration of DMSO (solvent for skf-96365).
Tumor volumes were evaluated twice weekly after
initial detection. Tumor sizes were measured with a
digital caliper. The tumor volume in mm3 was calculated
by the formula: volume = (width) 2 x length x 3.14/6.
When tumor size reached 15 mm in diameter, animals
were euthanized following IACUC guideline.

If not otherwise stated, findings were analyzed with
statistical software package SPSS 16.0 and Graphpad
Prism 5. The Pearson Chi-square test was used to analyze
the relationship between Orai1 expression and various
clinicopathological features. Survival curves were
generated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and
statistical analysis was performed using the Log-rank
test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model
was used to identify independent prognostic factors.
The Student’s t-test was used to analyze data obtained
from investigations of Orai1 expression in human cancer
tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues and from studies
of cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Findings
from measurements of SOCE and oscillations in [Ca2+]
i were analyzed using Origin Pro7.0. A p value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
