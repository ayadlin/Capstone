ABSTRACT
Cancer cells with self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity, either quiescent
(cancer stem cells, CSCs) or proliferating (cancer stem-like cells, CSLCs), are now
deemed responsible for the pervasive therapy resistance of pancreatic cancer, one
of the deadliest human cancers characterized by high prevalence of K-Ras mutation.
However, to date, much remains unknown how pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs are regulated.
Here we show that the K-Ras – JNK axis plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of
pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs. In vitro inhibition of JNK, either pharmacological or genetic,
caused loss of the self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity of pancreatic CSLCs.
Importantly, JNK inhibition in vivo via systemic JNK inhibitor administration, which
had no discernible effect on the general health status of mice, efficiently depleted
the CSC/CSLC population within pre-established pancreatic tumor xenografts.
Furthermore, knockdown of K-Ras in pancreatic CSLCs with K-Ras mutation led to
downregulation of the JNK pathway as well as in loss of self-renewal and tumorinitiating capacity. Together, our findings suggest that pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs are
dependent on K-Ras activation of JNK and also suggest that the K-Ras – JNK axis
could be a potential target in CSC/CSLC-directed therapies against pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

from pancreatic cancer is still on the rise in sharp contrast
to the all cancer mortality, which has been declining
steadily since the early 1990s [2]. Obviously, there is a
dire need for novel and innovative approaches based
on ground-breaking ideas to tackle this intractable
malignancy.
Since the identification of cancer stem cells (CSCs)
or cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) in pancreatic cancer [6,
7], pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs have emerged as a possible,
attractive explanation for the highly incorrigible therapy
resistance of pancreatic cancer [8-12]. CSCs and CSLCs,
which are distinguished according to whether they are
quiescent or proliferating [13, 14], are subpopulations of
tumor cells characterized by unlimited self-renewal and

Pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of
cancer-related mortality world-wide [1, 2] and is also
among the deadliest of all human cancers, with a median
survival less than 1 year and no more than one tenth
of the patients surviving 5 years [1, 2]. The pervasive
resistance of pancreatic cancer against conventional
chemoradiotherapy, in combination with the difficulty of
early detection, is considered to be the major contributing
factor to the highly dismal prognosis of this devastating
disease [3-5]. Although tremendous efforts have therefore
been made for the past decades to overcome the therapy
resistance of pancreatic cancer, strikingly, the mortality

tumor-initiating capacity, and are often associated with
high therapy resistance [13-16]. Not surprisingly, the
molecular mechanism contributing to the maintenance
of pancreatic CSCs/CSLSc have been an intense focus
of recent research, with an enthusiastic expectation that
elucidation of the mechanism would lead to development
of effective measures to target pancreatic CSCs/
CSLCs and by so doing to substantial improvement in
the prognosis of pancreatic cancer. So far, a number of
molecules and signaling pathways have been identified
and implicated in the mechanism [8-12], however, much
still remains to be learned as to how we can efficiently
eliminate CSCs/CSLCs from tumors of pancreatic cancer,
and that, in therapeutically feasible and significant
manners.
The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), a subgroup
of mitogen-activated protein kinases, are often deregulated
in a variety of human cancers including pancreatic cancer,
although the role and significance of JNK deregulation in
such human cancers have not been fully delineated [1721]. Recently, we and others have shown in vitro that
JNK is required for the maintenance of the self-renewal
and tumor-initiating capacity of human glioblastoma
CSLCs, giving rise to the novel possibility that the
maintenance of cancer stem (-like)/initiating cells may be
one of the critical roles of JNK in human cancers [22-24].
Most importantly, we have further demonstrated using
preclinical animal models that systemic JNK inhibitor
administration to tumor-bearing mice eliminates the CSC/
CSLC population within the tumors effectively and safely,
suggesting that JNK not only plays an essential role in
the maintenance of glioblastoma CSCs/CSLCs in vivo
but also could serve as a practical therapeutic target for
cancers whose stem (-like) cells are dependent on JNK
[22, 24]. However, to date, the role of JNK in the CSCs/
CSLCs of human cancers other than glioblastoma remains
unexplored.
Here in this study, we discovered that the JNKdependent mechanism of CSC/CSLC maintenance is
operative in human pancreatic cancer and demonstrated
that the mechanism can be targeted safely and effectively
in vivo. Furthermore, we also provide evidence that K-Ras
contributes to the maintenance of pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs
through JNK activation.

which are reportedly enriched for pancreatic cancer
cells with self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity
[25-28]. Consistent with the earlier reports, the sphereforming cells from PANC-1 xenografts (hereafter termed
PANC-1 CSLCs) were enriched for cells with surface
expression of CD133, a known marker for CSCs/CSLCs
of a variety of human cancers including pancreatic cancer
(Supplementary Figure S1A) [29, 30] and expressed
higher levels of pluripotency markers such as Sox2 and
Nanog (Supplementary Figure S1B, C), as compared
with their differentiated counterparts. Sphere formation
and xenograft assays also demonstrated PANC-1 CSLCs
have self-renewing and tumor-initiating capacity that
are lost upon differentiation (Supplementary Figure
S1D, E). Using PANC-1 CSLCs as a model, we then
set out to search for molecules or pathways that are
differentially expressed and/or activated in self-renewing
and differentiated PANC-1 CSLCs. Intriguingly, just as
we observed with CSLCs of glioblastoma [22], we noted
during the course of our experiments that the activity
of the JNK pathway, as represented by the expression
of phosphorylated JNK and c-Jun, was higher in selfrenewing cells than in their differentiated counterparts
(Supplementary Figure S1C). We therefore wished
to determine whether JNK has a role in the control
of PANC-1 CSLCs similarly to glioblastoma CSLCs.
Treatment of PANC-1 CSLCs with a pharmacological
inhibitor SP600125 at 30 µM, which effectively inhibited
the JNK activity of PANC-1 CSLCs (Figure 1C) without
significantly compromising their viability (Supplementary
Figure S2), reduced the proportion of CD133-positive
cells as well as the expression levels of Sox2 and Nanog
(Figure 1A - C). To determine whether the observed
changes in the stem cell marker expression reflected loss
of their self-renewal capacity, PANC-1 CSLCs pretreated
with SP600125 were tested for their ability to form spheres
in the absence of SP600125. The results indicated PANC-1
CSLCs had substantially lost their sphere-forming ability
after the transient SP600125 pretreatment (Figure 1D),
suggesting that JNK is required for the maintenance of
the self-renewal capacity of PANC-1 CSLCs. To ascertain
that the effect of SP600125 on PANC-1 CSLCs was
via inhibition of JNK, we next examined the effect of
JNK knockdown on their stem cell marker expression
and sphere-forming ability. To this end, we transiently
transfected into PANC-1 CSLCs combinations of siRNAs
directed against JNK1 and JNK2, which decreased the
expression of JNK1 and JNK2 (Figure 2B). Under this
JNK knockdown condition, the proportion of CD133positive cells, the expression of Sox2 and Nanog, and
the sphere-forming ability were significantly decreased
in JNK knockdown cells as compared to the control cells
(Figure 2A - C). Thus, the results of the JNK inhibition
experiments, both pharmacological and genetic,
consistently suggested that JNK plays a critical role in
the maintenance of the self-renewal capacity of PANC-

1 CSLCs. We then wished to ask if this role of JNK in
CSLC maintenance is shared among pancreatic CSLCs.
To this end, we isolated sphere-forming tumor cells from
PSN-1 pancreatic cancer xenografts (PSN-1 CSLCs)
(Supplementary Figure S3) and investigated the role of
JNK in PSN-1 CSLCs. The results indicated that both
pharmacological and genetic JNK inhibition caused
significant loss of the stem cell marker expression and
sphere-forming ability of PSN-1 CSLCs (Supplementary
Figures S4 and S5), essentially similarly to PANC-1
CSLCs. Together, the data demonstrate that JNK plays
an essential role in the maintenance of the self-renewal
capacity of in vitro cultured pancreatic CSLCs.
Along with the self-renewal capacity, the tumorinitiating capacity is one of the key properties of CSCs/
CSLCs that distinguish themselves from non-stem cancer
cells. We therefore determined next whether JNK is also
required for the maintenance of the tumor-initiating
capacity of pancreatic CSLCs. When different numbers of
PANC-1 CSLCs with or without SP600125 pretreatment
were implanted into nude mice, we found that 2 x
105 control PANC-1 CSLCs were sufficient to initiate
subcutaneous tumors whereas no tumors were initiated
by implantation of as many as 5 x 105 PANC-1 CSLCs

pretreated with SP600125 (Figure 1E). Essentially similar
results were obtained from knockdown experiments,
where JNK knockdown cells showed significantly
compromised tumor-initiating capacity in the xenograft
analysis as compared to the control knockdown cells
(Figure 2D). Thus, the data suggest that JNK is required
for the maintenance of the tumor-initiating capacity of in
vitro cultured pancreatic CSLCs.

JNK activity is required for the maintenance of
the pancreatic CSC/CSLC population within a
tumor but not for bulk tumor growth in vivo
Our in vitro analyses conducted thus far indicated
that JNK activity is required for the maintenance of
pancreatic CSLCs, at least in a defined, artificial cell
culture condition. To determine whether such in vitro
findings are relevant to CSCs/CSLCs in a more natural,
pathophysiological condition, we examined by the serial
transplantation assay the impact of JNK inhibition in vivo
on CSCs/CSLCs residing in pre-established tumors. Mice
harboring subcutaneous tumors formed by implantation of
PANC-1 CSLCs (primary tumors) were transiently treated

with or without systemic administration of SP600125
(60 mg/kg/day) for 10 consecutive days, after which the
subcutaneous tumors were excised and dissociated tumor
cells were transplanted subcutaneously into new mice after
serial dilution (2 x 106, 1 x 106, 0.5 x 106). When the mice
were then monitored for the development and growth of
secondary tumors, all mice transplanted with cells from
the control-treated tumors developed secondary tumors
that grew steadily to become larger than 2,000 mm3
(Figure 3A). Meanwhile, most of the mice transplanted
with cells from the SP600125-treated tumors did develop
tumors, at least initially. However, quite strikingly, the
secondary tumors derived from the SP600125-treated
primary tumors started to regress spontaneously ~ 4
weeks after transplantation (Figure 3A), suggesting that
JNK inhibition in vivo limited, albeit did not abolish
immediately, the self-renewal capacity of pancreatic
CSCs/CSLCs to such a degree that they could no longer
perpetuate tumor growth. In support of this idea, when
some of the regressing tumors were subjected to flow
cytometric analysis for CD133 expression, we found that

the regressing secondary tumors contained significantly
fewer, though not negligible, CD133-positive cells than
the steadily growing secondary tumors (i.e., derived from
the control-treated primary tumors) (Supplementary Figure
S6). Extended observation of the remaining secondary
tumors derived from the SP600125-treated primary tumors
confirmed that all regressing tumors eventually became
invisible and impalpable, i.e., regressed completely.
Curious enough, the growth curve for one secondary tumor
showed a tri-phasic pattern (= three rounds of growth
coupled with regression), illuminating the possibility that
the primary tumor had contained “delayed contributing”
tumor-initiating cells [31] whose self-renewing capacity
was limited by SP600125 treatment (Figure 3A, B).
Notably, in contrast to the marked inhibitory effect of in
vivo JNK inhibition on the CSC/CSLC population within
the tumors, the exactly identical SP600125 treatment
protocol failed to have the slightest inhibitory effect on
bulk tumor growth during the 10-day treatment period
(Figure 3C). Collectively, our results suggest that, in
vivo, JNK activity may be specifically required for the

and survival of non- CSCs/CSLCs and that JNK inhibition
may set a limit to the otherwise limitless self-renewal
capacity of pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs.

in vivo, we next turned our attention to the mechanism
by which the JNK activity of pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs
is maintained. Since JNK was originally identified as a
kinase activated by Ras [32, 33], and given that K-Ras
is mutationally activated in more than 90% of pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma [34, 35], we first sought to
determine whether K-Ras has a role in the control of
JNK signaling in pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs. To do this, we
knocked down using two different siRNAs the expression
of K-Ras in PANC-1 CSLCs, which were derived from
PANC-1 cells having a mutated (G12D) K-Ras allele

into 2 treatment groups (8 mice per group) at 4 weeks after implantation when the average tumor volume reached ~ 400 mm3, and received a
daily intraperitoneal injection of the control vehicle or SP600125 (60 mg/kg/day) for 10 consecutive days. On the next day of the final drug
treatment, the subcutaneous tumors (primary tumors) were excised and dissociated, and serial dilutions of the dissociated tumor cells were

[36]. The results of knockdown experiments indicated
that both siRNAs directed against K-Ras caused reduced
phosphorylation of JNK as well as that of c-Jun (Figure
4A), suggesting that K-Ras expression is required for
the maintenance of JNK signaling in PANC-1 CSLCs.
Given that K-Ras is required for the JNK activity which
we have just demonstrated to play an essential role in the
maintenance of pancreatic CSLCs, we next went on to
ask if K-Ras also has a role in the maintenance of PANC1 CSLCs. The results of the stem cell marker analyses
indicated that K-Ras knockdown reduced the proportion
of CD133-positive cells, as well as the expression of Sox2
and Nanog in PANC-1 CSLCs (Figure 4B, C). K-Ras

knockdown also inhibited the sphere-forming ability of
PANC-1 CSLCs (Figure 4D), in good agreement with the
results of the stem cell marker analyses. Together, these
data suggested that K-Ras activation of JNK plays a key
role in the maintenance of the self-renewal capacity of
PANC-1 CSLCs. We next determined whether this role
of the K-Ras – JNK axis is unique to PANC-1 CSLCs
or is commonly shared by other pancreatic CSLCs by
examining PSN-1 cells, which are also reported to harbor
a mutation (G12R) in the K-Ras gene [37]. The results
of the K-Ras knockdown experiments using PSN-1
CSLCs were essentially similar to those obtained from
PANC-1 CSLCs (Supplementary Figure S7), in favor of

the idea that the K-Ras – JNK axis may have a common
role in the maintenance of the self-renewal capacity of
pancreatic CSLCs. Finally, to confirm that K-Ras also
contributes to the maintenance of the tumor-initiating
capacity of pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs, we tested the
tumor-initiating capacity of K-Ras knockdown cells in
the xenograft analysis. Whereas implantation of 2 x 105
cells was sufficient for control knockdown cells to initiate
steadily growing tumors, K-Ras knockdown PANC-1
CSLCs failed to initiate tumor formation throughout the
extended observation period even when as many as 5 x 105
cells were implanted (Figure 4E). Combined, these data
suggest that K-Ras activation of JNK has a critical role in
the maintenance of the self-renewal and tumor-initiating
capacity of pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs.

for the idea that JNK is essential for the maintenance
of pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs in vivo. Furthermore, we
confirmed that the protocol of JNK inhibitor treatment we
adopted for the serial transplantation assay of this study
(60 mg/kg/day for 10 consecutive days) was well tolerated
by nude mice and did not affect their general health
status for at least 2 months (Supplementary Figure S8).
Combined, these findings suggest that JNK is a promising
target molecule to eliminate pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs in
vivo.
Significantly, transplantation of tumor cells from
SP600125-treated primary tumors once led to formation
of secondary tumors in most of the recipient mice, all of
which eventually regressed spontaneously. This unique
observation provides unequivocal, important evidence
that JNK inhibition in vivo did not critically interfere with
the process of tumor cell “engraftment” per se, which is
an artificial process that inevitably accompanies and is
inherent in xenograft analyses. Instead, the observation
could more plausibly be explained by the idea that JNK
inhibition in vivo turned long-term tumor-initiating cells
(bona fide CSCs/CSLCs) into tumor transient amplifying
cells which are assumed to have limited or no self-renewal
capacity and contribute to tumor formation only in primary
mice [31]. We speculate that ultimate depletion of CSCs/
CSLCs took place at some time point in the course of the
secondary tumor formation, which led to cessation of cell
supply and tipped the balance of the tumor tissue kinetics
in favor of regression, i.e., more cell loss than cell gain.
In one recipient mouse, we observed 3 rounds of tumor
formation and regression, the latest of which occurred
around 4 – 5 months after transplantation. This finding
may lend support to the idea that there existed delayed
contributing tumor-initiating cells (which are also bona
fide CSCs/CSLCs) in the primary tumors, the self-renewal
capacity of which was limited (turned into tumor transient
amplifying cells) by JNK inhibition. Importantly, for as
long as 6 months, no sustained tumor growth has taken
place in any of the mice transplanted with tumor cells
from SP600125-treated primary tumors (Figure 3A and B),
which implies that the short-term, transient JNK inhibition
was sufficient to deprive CSCs/CSLCs of their tumorinitiating capacity and at the same time prevent them from
recovering it in vivo at least during the observation period.
Although it is practically impossible to test whether or
not the effect of JNK inhibition is actually “irreversible”
using xenograft models involving an experimental animal
with relatively short life span, our results suggest that JNK
inhibition may be a promising approach to achieve longterm control over pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs.
Notably, the exactly identical treatment protocol that
so effectively eliminated CSCs/CSLCs within the primary
tumors had virtually no inhibitory effect on the growth of
the primary tumors during the 10-day treatment period,
implying that JNK activity is “not immediately required”
for pancreatic cancer cells to maintain proliferation and

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most intractable of
all human cancers with high therapeutic resistance, and
currently, pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs are drawing increasing
and considerable attention as a possible culprit for the
therapeutic resistance of pancreatic cancer [8-12]. So
far, with an intention to identify novel therapeutic targets
to overcome the therapy resistance, efforts have been
made to dissect the molecular pathways involved in the
control of pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs, which has led to the
identification of a number of pathways implicated in their
control. For instance, the Hedgehog [38-40], Notch [41],
and Nodal/Activin [26] pathways have been identified
as having a role in the maintenance of pancreatic CSCs/
CSLCs, for which pharmacological agents modulating
their activities are already available for use and have
shown therapeutic effects in preclinical models of
pancreatic cancer. While such pharmacological agents are
thus expected to make attractive candidates to be tested in
the clinical settings in future, apparently, information on
targetable pathways/molecules for the control of pancreatic
CSCs/CSLCs is still absolutely limited. In this study,
therefore, we attempted to expand our knowledge on the
molecular mechanisms by which pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs
are maintained. Our findings indicated that inhibition of
JNK in pancreatic CSLCs resulted in decreased stem cell
marker expression and sphere-forming ability, as well as
in loss of their tumor-initiating capacity, thus identifying
JNK as a hitherto unrecognized, novel key player in the
control of pancreatic CSCs/CSLCs.
As one of the most important findings of this
study, we have demonstrated by the serial transplantation
assay that systemically-administered JNK inhibitor
quite efficiently deprives CSCs/CSLCs of their capacity
to sustain tumor growth in vivo. Given that the serial
transplantation assay, coupled with serial dilution of the
cells to be transplanted, is currently the most reliable,
albeit not flawless, method to evaluate the incidence of
CSCs/CSLCs [15, 42], our results make out a strong case

survival. A similar pattern was reported in a previous
study in which the effect of systemic administration
of a Hedgehog inhibitor was tested against pancreatic
tumor xenografts [43]. Our results, in conjunction with
those reported in the study, thus underscore the potential
difficulty in proper evaluation of the anti-tumor effect
of CSC/CSLC-specific drugs. Although our treatment
protocol failed to control the growth of established
tumors, it does not necessarily imply that JNK inhibition
is ineffective against bulk pancreatic tumors in vivo in any
condition, since a recent report clearly demonstrated that
the growth (assessed by tumor area) and the tumor cell
proliferation (assessed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen
positivity) of pancreatic tumors developing in K-RasG12D
+ Tgfbr2KO mice were significantly inhibited by systemic
administration of JNK inhibitors [21]. Nevertheless, given
the at best modest inhibitory effects of JNK inhibition on
bulk tumor growth shown in the study [21] and in the
present study, apparently, it is essential that future JNKtargeting therapies against pancreatic cancers be combined
with other treatment modalities aimed at the tumor bulk.
We also demonstrated as another key finding
of this study that K-Ras plays an essential role in the
maintenance of both the JNK activity in pancreatic
CSLCs and their self-renewal and tumor-initiating
capacity. The K-Ras gene is the most frequently mutated
among known oncogenes and is indeed mutated (and
activated by mutation) in more than 90% of pancreatic
cancers [34, 35]. JNK was originally identified as a kinase
activated by H-Ras [32, 33], but subsequently, it was
demonstrated that mutated K-Ras activates JNK in vitro
and in vivo [44, 45]. Intriguingly, the K-RasG12D mutant,
the most common mutant allele in pancreatic cancers
[46], has been shown to preferentially activate the JNK
pathway rather than the ERK pathway [44]. In line with
these findings, a recent study demonstrated that JNK is
activated in human pancreatic cancer tissues as well as in
pancreatic cancer cell lines, pointing to the possibility that
K-Ras may have a role in JNK activation in pancreatic
cancers [21]. In addition to such a role of K-Ras mutation
in JNK activation, the role of mutated K-Ras in tumor
maintenance has also been documented in lung and
pancreatic cancer models [47, 48]. In these models, tumor
regression caused by K-Ras inactivation was accompanied
by extensive apoptosis of the tumor cells [47, 48],
suggesting that K-Ras contributes to tumor maintenance
at least in part through survival of bulk tumor cells.
Significantly, a previous report demonstrated that, in lung
and pancreatic cancer cells harboring K-Ras mutation,
cells with a well-differentiated epithelial phenotype were
more dependent on K-Ras for their viability than those
with a less well-differentiated, mesenchymal phenotype
[49]. Together, these previous findings suggest that
K-Ras mutation may have a role in JNK activation and
cellular survival at least in bulk tumor cells of pancreatic
cancers with mutated K-Ras. However, in contrast to its
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

well-defined roles in bulk tumor cells [50], the role of
Ras mutation in CSCs/CSLCs of K-Ras-mutated tumors
has remained unknown so far. Here in this study, we
have delineated the role of K-Ras mutation in CSCs/
CSLCs using pancreatic CSLCs as a model. Although
exogenous expression of mutationally activated K-Ras
alleles has been shown in other studies to favor expansion
of the CSLC population in colon cancer models [51, 52],
to our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate
the essential role of endogenously expressed K-Ras in
the maintenance of the self-renewal and tumor-initiating
capacity of CSCs/CSLCs.
Our demonstration in the present study that K-Ras
activated JNK in pancreatic CSLCs and that K-Ras as
well as JNK was similarly required for their maintenance
suggests that the K-Ras – JNK axis plays a pivotal role
in the maintenance of the CSC/CSLC population of
pancreatic cancer. However, our data do not necessarily
exclude the possibilities that K-Ras and JNK have other
downstream mediators and upstream activators involved
in the control of CSCs/CSLCs, respectively. In addition,
although Rac1 is an attractive candidate molecule linking
K-Ras and JNK [53], it still remains to be delineated in this
study how K-Ras activates JNK in CSLCs. Apparently,
unraveling the molecular interplay involved in the control
of CSCs/CSLCs by the K-Ras - JNK axis in future studies
is expected to provide useful information in identifying
novel molecular targets for CSC/CSLC-directed therapies.
Of note, beyond pancreatic cancer, an essential role of
JNK has been documented in K-Ras-induced lung tumor
development [53], which points to the possibility that
the role of the K-Ras - JNK axis in the control of CSCs/
CSLCs may not be unique to pancreatic cancer but may
be shared by other human cancers. In further support of
this possibility, we have recently demonstrated that JNK
is essential for the maintenance of the tumor-initiating
capacity but not for the bulk tumor growth of A549 lung
adenocarcinoma cells known to harbor an activating
K-Ras mutation [54-56]. It would therefore be of great
interest to examine whether the K-Ras – JNK axis has a
similar, CSC/CSLC-specific role in other human cancers
with mutated Ras. Such an attempt would have great
therapeutic impact given the high prevalence of Ras
mutation in human cancer.
In conclusion, we have presented for the first time
in this study evidence that the K-Ras - JNK axis plays
a key role in the maintenance of pancreatic CSCs/
CSLCs. Our findings suggest that K-Ras mutation could
contribute to tumor development and maintenance at least
in part through the maintenance of CSCs/CSLCs, thus
providing a novel and significant insight into the role
of Ras mutation in tumor cell biology. Furthermore, our
data demonstrated that JNK could be a viable target in
CSC/CSLC-directed therapies against pancreatic cancer.
Combination therapies targeting both the K-Ras - JNK
axis in CSCs/CSLCs and the bulk tumor component, for

instance by conventional chemotherapies, would therefore
be a rational and promising approach to treat pancreatic
cancers and hopefully other intractable human cancers
with Ras mutation.

previously described [22, 58]. In brief, cells were cultured
on collagen-I-coated dishes (IWAKI, Tokyo, Japan) in
the stem cell culture medium (DMEM/F12 medium
supplemented with 1% B27 [Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, CA,
USA], 20 ng/mL EGF and FGF2 [Peprotech, Inc.,Rocky
Hill, NJ, USA], D-(+)-glucose [final concentration, 26.2
mM], L-glutamine [final concentration, 4.5 mM], 100
units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). In
principle, the stem cell culture medium was changed
every 3 days, and EGF and FGF2 were added to the
culture medium every day. Differentiation of pancreatic
CSLCs was induced by culturing the cells under the
differentiation-inducing condition (DMEM/F12 containing
10% FBS) for 2 weeks. Throughout the study, the cell
number was determined using a hemocytometer, and the
cell viability was examined by the dye exclusion method
(0.2% trypan blue). Cell viability (%) was defined as 100
x ‘the number of viable cells’/ (‘the number of viable cells’
+ ‘the number of dead cells’).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies and reagents
Anti-c-Jun (#9165), anti-phospho-c-Jun (#9261),
anti-phospho-JNK (#9251), anti-Sox2 (#3579), antiNanog (#4903), anti-E-cadherin (#3195) antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.
(Beverly, MA, USA). Anti-β-actin (A1978) was from
Sigma (St. Luis, MO, USA). Anti-JNK1 (sc-474), antiJNK2 (sc-7345) and anti-K-Ras (sc-30) were from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). AntiCD133 (W6B3C1) was from Miltenyi Biotech (Germany).
SP600125 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA,
USA) and was dissolved in DMSO to prepare a 50 mM
stock solution.

Gene silencing by siRNA
siRNAs against human JNK1 (#1: VHS40722, #2:
VHS40724), JNK2 (#1: VHS40726, #2: VHS40729),
and K-Ras (#1: HSS180200, #2: HSS105872) as well
as Medium GC Duplex #2 of Stealth RNAiTM siRNA
Negative Control Duplexes (as a control for siRNA
experiments) were purchased from Invitrogen Life
Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Transfection of
siRNAs was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. To achieve sustained knockdown of the target
genes, siRNA transfection was repeated 4 days after the
initial transfection.

Cell culture
The human pancreas cancer cell line PANC-1 was
obtained from Cell Resource Center for Biomedical
Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer,
Tohoku University. PSN-1 was a kind gift from Dr.
Teruhiko Yoshida at National Cancer Center Research
Institute, who originally established the cell line from
pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissue [37]. These cell lines
were maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 units/mL penicillin
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. To establish PANC-1
CSLCs, PANC-1 cells were implanted subcutaneously
into nude mice after being cultured and amplified under
the monolayer stem cell culture condition [22, 57, 58].
After formation of subcutaneous tumors, the tumors
were excised and cells from the tumors were, after
dissociation, cultured on non-coated dishes in the stem
cell culture medium. Cells from spheres formed under
this culture condition were transferred and amplified
under the monolayer stem cell culture condition, which
were then used as PANC-1 CSLCs after characterization
as shown in Supplementary Figure S1. PSN-1 CSLCs
were established in a similar manner to PANC-1 CSLCs.
The authenticity of PANC-1 CSLCs and PSN-1 CSLCs
as cells derived from PANC-1 and PSN-1, respectively,
was verified by genotyping of short tandem repeat (STR)
loci (Bio-Synthesis, Inc., Lewisville, TX, USA) followed
by comparison to the ATCC STR database for Human
Cell Lines. Unless otherwise indicated, these pancreatic
CSLCs were stably maintained and used for experiments
under the monolayer stem cell culture condition, as
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Sphere formation assay
After being dissociated into single cells, PANC-1
cells were serially diluted in the stem cell culture medium
and seeded into non-coated 96-well plates so that there be
a single cell in each well. Wells containing a single cell
were marked on the next day and, 1 week after seeding,
the percentage of marked wells with a sphere relative to
the total number of marked wells was determined. For
PSN-1 CSLCs, dissociated cells were suspended in the
stem cell culture medium at a density of 5 × 103 cells/
mL. Then, 2 mL of the cell suspension (1 × 104 cells) was
transferred to each well of a non-coated 12-well plate. The
number of spheres in each well was counted 5 days after
seeding.

Flow cytometric analysis

The membrane was probed with a primary antibody and
then with an appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody according to the protocol recommended by
the manufacturer of each antibody. Immunoreactive
bands were visualized using Immobilon Western
Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA).

Dissociated cells were washed with ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% (w/v)
paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT),
and washed again with PBS. The cells were then blocked
in FACS buffer (0.5% [w/v] bovine serum albumin, 0.1%
[w/v] NaN3 in PBS) for 30 min, followed by 3 PBS rinses
and subsequently by incubation with the anti-CD133
antibody in the FACS buffer for 1 h and then with the
Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG for another 30
min at RT. Gating for single cells was established using
forward scatter in the isotype control samples. The isotype
control samples were used to establish a gate in the
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) channel. Cells showing
signal for CD133 above the gate established by the isotype
control were deemed CD133-positive. All flow cytometric
analysis experiments were run on FACSCantoTM II Flow
Cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

Mouse studies
Mouse xenograft studies were carried out essentially
as previously described. Five- to 8-week-old male BALB/
cAJcl-nu/nu mice (Clea Japan, Inc.) were, after being
anesthetized with avertin (0.375 g/kg intraperitoneally),
implanted subcutaneously in the flank region with
cells suspended in 200 μL of PBS. After implantation,
the recipient mice were monitored for general health
status and the presence of subcutaneous tumors. Tumor
volume was determined by measuring tumor diameters
(measurement of 2 perpendicular axes of tumors) using
a caliper and calculated as 1/2 x (larger diameter) x
(smaller diameter)2. For serial transplantation, primary
tumors treated as in the figure legend were excised and,
after being washed in chilled sterile PBS, transferred
into DMEM/F12, minced with scissors, and incubated
in a dissociation enzyme solution (20 mM HEPES-PBS
[pH7.4] containing 0.02% DNase I [Sigma, A4572] and
0.02% collagenase II [Sigma, C6885]) for 30 min at 37
°C. After being rinsed with DMEM/F12, the cells were
re-suspended in DMEM/F12 and filtered through a 70-μm
strainer. After determination of cell number and viability,
the single-cell suspension of the tumor cells was subjected
to subcutaneous injection. Some of the secondary tumors
were excised for photographic documentation or for
flow cytometric analysis after being dissociated just as
described above for the primary tumors. For systemic
administration of SP600125, the SP600125 stock solution
(50 mM in DMSO) was diluted in PBS to prepare 200 μL
solutions of SP600125 for each injection. The SP600125
solutions were injected intraperitoneally into nude mice.
Control mice received 200 μL of DMSO diluted in PBS.
Note that all the control- and SP600125-treated mice
received an equal volume of DMSO per body weight
(3.6 mL/kg/day). All animal experiments were performed
under a protocol approved by the Animal Research
Committee of Yamagata University.

RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Life
Technologies). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed
into cDNA using PrimeScriptTM 1st strand cDNA
Synthesis kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplification was
performed with cycles of 97 °C for 30 sec, 58 °C for
30 sec, and 72 °C for 1 min in a thermal cycler (Takara
PCR Thermal Cycler Dice). PCR cycles were 35 for
Sox2, Nanog and 28 for β-actin. RT-PCR analysis was
performed with the following primers: Sox2 (forward:
5’-CCAAGATGCACAACTCGGAGATCAGC, reverse:
5’- CGAGCCGTTCATGTAGGTCTGCGAG), Nanog
(forward: 5’- AGTCCCAAAGGCAAACAACCCACTTC,
reverse: 5’- GACTGGCTGTTCTGGGTCTGGTTG),
β-actin (forward: 5’-CCCATGCCA TCCTGCGTCTG,
reverse: 5’-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTG CTG).

Immunoblot analysis
Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in
RIPA buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% SDS, 0.1%
sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium
pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate and
1% protease inhibitor cocktail set III (Calbiochem)].
After centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 x g at 4 °C, the
supernatants were recovered as the cell lysates, and the
protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined
by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology,
Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). Cell lysates containing equal
amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane.
