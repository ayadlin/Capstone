development and progression of tumors (1). Nontranscriptional
induction of apoptosis can also occur through binding of mitochondrially directed p53 and inactivation of Bcl2 or other antiapoptotic proteins (5, 6).
In this study, we use genotoxic stress–induced DNA damage to
promote expression and to reverse cytoplasmic sequestration of
p53, and to restore its apoptotic function in a naturally occurring
diffuse tumor of the hemocytes of the soft shell clam. In leukemic
clam hemocytes, a highly conserved clam homologue for human
p53 (Map53; Genbank accession number AF253323) is rendered
nonfunctional by sequestration in the cytoplasm by both variants
of the clam homologue for human mortalin (Mya arenaria
mortalin, full-length and truncated; Genbank Accession numbers
AY326398 and EF576660, respectively; refs. 7, 8). Truncated clam
mortalin is missing exon 3 that includes the ATP-binding and
ATPase domain required to reverse p53 binding. We hypothesize
that normal transcriptional functions of p53 in tumor suppression
are silenced when clam mortalin proteins are overexpressed. For
instance, transcriptionally controlled editing and repair of DNA
and induction of apoptosis would not be initiated by p53 that
cannot enter the nucleus, bind DNA, and direct the expression
of relevant genes. Similarly, ubiquination dictated by Mdm2
binding to the transactivation domain (TAD) of p53 or by CIP1
down-regulation of G1 cyclin-/cyclin-dependent kinase–dependent
phosphorylation and activation of p53 cannot occur. Cytoplasmicsequestered p53 might still direct nontranscriptional initiation of
apoptosis at the mitochondria if mortalin binding does not
interfere with this pathway (9).
Although cytoplasmic sequestration has not yet been recorded
for human leukemias or lymphomas, a subset of naturally
occurring but unrelated human cancers do retain p53 in the
cytoplasm (e.g., undifferentiated neuroblastoma, breast, retinoblastoma, colorectal adenocarcinomas, and glioblastoma; refs 10–12),
and this phenotype can be induced in mouse NIH 3T3 and human
HeLa cells (13–16). In all of these cases, wild-type p53 is inactivated
because it is retained in the cytoplasm. A variety of molecular
mechanisms have been linked to cytoplasmic sequestration in
these human cancers, such as truncation of the nuclear localization
motif receptor protein importin a (17), overactive nuclear
export by an Mdm2 dependent pathway (18), and cytoplasmic
tethering by foreign (viral; ref. 19) or local cytoplasmic proteins
(9, 15, 20). In human colorectal cancer cells and leukemic clam
hemocytes, mortalin is responsible for cytoplasmic tethering
when the latter protein is overexpressed (8, 21). Dundas et al.
(12) indicate that high levels of mortalin expression are correlated
with poor clinical outcome for colorectal cancer. A recent study
of primary and secondary glioblastomas suggests that mortalin
and/or other tethering molecules (e.g., cullin 7 or PARC) may be
also be responsible for cytoplasmic sequestration in these cancers.

Abstract
In nature, the soft shell clam, Mya arenaria, develops a fatal
blood cancer in which a highly conserved homologue for wildtype human p53 protein is rendered nonfunctional by
cytoplasmic sequestration. In untreated leukemic clam hemocytes, p53 is complexed throughout the cytoplasm with
overexpressed variants for both clam homologues ( full-length
variant, 1,200-fold and truncated variant, 620-fold above
normal clam hemocytes) of human mortalin, an Hsp70 family
protein. In vitro treatment with etoposide only and in vivo
treatment with either etoposide or mitoxantrone induces DNA
damage, elevates expression (600-fold) and promotes nuclear
translocation of p53, and results in apoptosis of leukemic clam
hemocytes. Pretreatment with wheat germ agglutinin followed
by etoposide treatment induces DNA damage and elevates p53
expression (893-fold) but does not overcome cytoplasmic
sequestration of p53 or induce apoptosis. We show that
leukemic clam hemocytes have an intact p53 pathway, and
that maintenance of this tumor phenotype requires nuclear
absence of p53, resulting from its localization in the
cytoplasm of leukemic clam hemocytes. The effects of these
topoisomerase II poisons may result as mortalin-based
cytoplasmic tethering is overwhelmed by de novo expression
of p53 protein after DNA damage induced by genotoxic
stress. Soft shell clam leukemia provides excellent in vivo
and in vitro models for developing genotoxic and nongenotoxic cancer therapies for reactivating p53 transcription
in human and other animal cancers displaying mortalin-based
cytoplasmic sequestration of the p53 tumor suppressor, such
as colorectal cancers and primary and secondary glioblastomas, though not apparently leukemias or lymphomas. [Cancer
Res 2008;68(3):777–82]

Introduction
In normal mammalian cells, p53 suppresses the formation of
tumors by arresting the cell cycle or by apoptosis in response to
genotoxic stress–induced DNA damage (1). Levels and activity
of p53 increase in response to DNA damaging agents (2–4).
Transcription of p53-regulated genes yields proteins that can edit
and repair DNA and/or promote apoptosis based on the degree of
DNA damage. Loss of cell cycle control results upon inactivation of
p53 and loss of p53 transcriptional activity, and can lead to

Treatment of leukemic clam hemocytes with topoisomerase II
poisons in vitro. Hemolymph was removed from the pericardial sinus of
fully leukemic (100%) clams and was diluted with clam culture medium (24)
to 4  105 leukemic clam hemocytes mL 1. Hemolymph and topoisomerase
II poisons (0–0.07 mmol/L mitoxantrone and 0–0.1 mmol/L etoposide) were
diluted with clam culture medium to a final concentration of 1  105
leukemic clam hemocytes mL 1 in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (Fisher
Scientific). Samples of 400 mL were removed at time 0, 6, and 18 h; in vivo —
to approximate drug concentrations used in vitro (0.07 mmol/L mitoxantrone and 0.075 mmol/L etoposide), hemolymph volumes were estimated
based on clamshell size, and the appropriate concentrations of drugs were
injected immediately after the zero time biopsy. Additional biopsies were
performed at 8, 20, and 24 h on 800 AL of hemolymph removed from the
pericardial sinus.
Pretreatment of leukemic clam hemocytes with wheat germ
agglutinin in vitro. To evaluate mechanism of action of p53 and detect
any alternative routes leading to apoptosis, we set up four treatments:
leukemic clam hemocytes untreated, leukemic clam hemocytes treated with
wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) only, leukemic clam hemocytes treated with
0.075 mmol/L etoposide only, and leukemic clam hemocytes pretreated
with WGA followed by exposure to 0.075 mmol/L etoposide. Pretreatment
of leukemic clam hemocytes with WGA was conducted using FITC-labeled
WGA (Sigma) that was transfected into the cells using the Chariot protein
delivery system (Active Motif). WGA was allowed to couple with the Chariot
compound for 30 min at room temperature to form complexes that were
incubated for 1 h with leukemic clam hemocytes suspended in clam culture
medium at concentrations of 6  105 hemocytes per 100 AL medium.
Successful transfection of WGA into leukemic clam hemocytes results in
blockage of the nuclear pores, and translocation of p53 into the nucleus
should also be blocked. De novo or unbound p53 should be directed to
mitochondria, resulting in nontranscriptional induction of apoptosis. After
transfection, all treatments (control and etoposide treated) were allowed to
incubate for 6 h, nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were separated (NEPER;
Pierce), and clam p53 distribution was determined using Western blotting.
Cytotoxicity assay. Before in vitro and in vivo drug treatments, lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured (CytoTox 96 NonRadioactive
Cytotoxicity Assay G1780; Promega) using increasing numbers of leukemic
clam hemocytes (0–140,000 cells) to test the validity of this assay in the clam
model, determine the numbers of leukemic clam hemocytes needed, and
adjust environmental conditions (e.g., temperature). Once these variables
were determined, we followed the procedure and analyses described by
Promega and used in >350 published studies.
Immunocytochemistry. Cytospins of 100 AL of leukemic clam
hemocytes from untreated and treated individuals in vitro and in vivo
were fixed and permeabilized by immersion in acetone. These preparations
were treated with the clam p53 primary antibody (7). Resulting preparations
were developed with a peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (Vectastain
ABC Elite IgG kit; Vector Laboratories). Control cytospins received identical
treatment in the absence of primary antibody. After completing the assay,
fields of 200 leukemic clam hemocytes were counted and scored into three
categories: (a) cells with predominantly nuclear clam p53, (b) cells with
predominantly cytoplasmic clam p53, and (c) cells where the intracellular
distribution of clam p53 was indeterminate. The nonparametric WilcoxonMann-Whitney test was applied to assess differences between results in
catagories a to c and between time points.
Western blotting. To determine the cellular localization of p53 protein,
nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted from 200 AL of
hemolymph containing leukemic clam hemocytes at each time point
during treatment with mitoxantrone and etoposide using NE-PER (nuclear
and cytoplasmic extraction reagents; Pierce). Total protein was measured
spectrophotometrically (Ultraspec 3100) using a modified Lowry procedure
(Bio-Rad protein assay). Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins (37.5 Ag) were
assayed by Western blotting on 4-15% Tris-HCl Ready gels (Bio-Rad)
transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), treated with
the clam p53 primary antibody, and visualized colorimetrically (7).
Comet assay. To detect DNA damage during in vitro and in vivo drug
treatments with topoisomerase II agents (measured as DNA fragmentation

In the current study, we use leukemic clam hemocytes for in vitro
and in vivo assays to evaluate cytotoxicity, intracellular localization
of p53, DNA damage, and apoptosis after treatment with two
genotoxic DNA topoisomerase II poisons, etoposide, and mitoxantrone. Because we were investigating a blood disease in the clam,
these topoisomerase II poisons were originally chosen from the
standard agent database at the National Cancer Institute because
they are highly cytotoxic to human lymphoblastic leukemia cell
lines (22) and have shown effectiveness against human leukemias
and lymphomas.1 Importantly, these topoisomerase II poisons do
have significant genotoxic effects on a variety of human cancers
but have never been evaluated in terms of their effects on cancers
resulting from mortalin-based cytoplasmic sequestration.
Understanding the molecular basis for this negative regulatory
pathway for p53 might lead to therapies for any human cancer
where cytoplasmic sequestration is mediated by mortalin. As
Martins et al. (23) point out, ‘‘reinstatement of p53 function is an
attractive tumor-specific therapeutic strategy, but it will only work
if tumors harbor persistent p53-activating signals that engage
growth inhibition or death.’’ In the present study, we show that
clam leukemia cells have an intact p53-activating pathway leading
to apoptosis, and that maintenance of this diffuse tumor requires
nuclear absence of p53 dictated by its localization in the cytoplasm.

Materials and Methods
Clams. Soft shell clams (Mya arenaria; n = 150–200) were collected at
the lowest tides of each month from sand flats on Marsh Island in New
Bedford Harbor at Fairhaven, Massachusetts (41j 38.0¶ N 70j 55.0¶ W) and
maintained at the University of New Hampshire Coastal Marine Laboratory,
New Castle, New Hampshire. For biopsy, a small aliquot of hemolymph
(10 AL) was removed from the pericardial sinus and incubated for 2 h at
8jC. Clams were classified with a Zeiss IM inverted microscope as normal
(0%, round, nonmotile leukemic clam hemocytes; 100%, attached normal
clam hemocytes), early incipient leukemic (1%–50%, leukemic clam
hemocytes), late incipient leukemic (50%–99%, leukemic clam hemocytes),
or fully leukemic (100%, leukemic clam hemocytes). In 51 collections made
over a 5-year period, the average number of clams that was 100% leukemic
was 5.64%; the range was 0–11%. Only fully leukemic clams were used for
the experiments presented in this study.
Antibody for p53. A polyclonal antibody to Mya arenaria p53 protein
(Map53 rabbit anticlam polyclonal) was raised against a peptide
synthesized from a highly immunogenic region in the core sequence of
clam p53 and including part of DNA binding domain V (Map53 23-mer
CACPGRDRKADERGSLPPMVSGG). The polyclonal antibody obtained was
successfully screened for its ability to recognize clam p53 in Western blot
analysis of both in vitro expressed clam proteins and whole cell extracts
collected in vivo from leukemic and normal clam hemocytes (7).
Treatment of leukemic clam hemocytes with leptomycin B in vitro.
To determine if overactive nuclear export is responsible for cytoplasmic
sequestration of p53, leukemic clam hemocytes were treated with
leptomycin B, which blocks CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Hemolymph
was removed from the pericardial sinus of fully leukemic (100%) clams.
Blood was divided into eight tubes for time 0, 4, 8, and 24 h with two
treatments per time (control and leptomycin B treatment). Leptomycin B
treatments only received a final concentration of 115 nmol/L leptomycin B,
control treatments received normal clam medium without the drug. All
tubes were maintained on a rotator at 8jC for the required length of time.
At each time point (time 0, 4, 8, and 24 h), nuclear and cytoplasmic protein
extractions (NEPER; Pierce) were performed and clam p53 distribution was
determined using Western blotting.

and observed as a comet-shaped tail discharged from the nucleus),
COMET assays were performed at each time point (Trevigen CometAssay
kit 4250-050). Results were scored as percent of DNA-damaged cells in a
total of 100 cells.
Apoptosis assays. To document apoptosis, Romanovsky staining
(ThermoShandon; Kwik Diff Stain kit) and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling (TUNEL) assay (in situ cell
death detection kit; AP; Roche) were performed on cytospins of leukemic
clam hemocytes at 6 h in vitro and 8 h in vivo. After staining, hemocytes
were mounted under coverslips with Permount ( for Romanovsky; Fisher
Scientific) or with Vectashield ( for TUNEL; Vector Laboratories) and scored
at 600 on a Zeiss Axioplan II microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.; ref. 25). For the
Romanovsky assay, cells were designated as apoptotic when intracellular
vacuoles were observed, and apoptosis was expressed as a percentage in a
total of 100 cells. For the TUNEL assay, results were scored as percentage of
apoptotic cells (TUNEL-positive cells) of total of 100 cells.
Quantitative PCR. To document expression of mortalin and p53, 500 AL
of hemolymph were removed from normal, leukemic, and 0.075 mmol/L

etoposide-treated leukemic clams (with and without prior treatment with
WGA). The hemolymph was centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min, RNA extracted
using Trizol (Invitrogen), and cDNA synthesized using SuperScript FirstStrand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). All samples were prepared for quantitative PCR (QPCR) using the Taqman Fast System (Applied Biosystems)
and run in a 7500 Fast reverse transcription-PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) at 45 cycles of 95jC with automatically set cycle threshold (Ct).

Results
Treatment with 115 nmol/L of the nuclear export blocker
leptomycin B for 8 and 24 h did not result in localization of p53 in
the nucleus, suggesting that overactive nuclear export of p53
mediated by CRM1 is not responsible for cytoplasmic sequestration
in leukemic clam hemocytes (data not shown).
LDH activity decreased for leukemic clam hemocytes treated
with etoposide at 6 h in vitro (0–0.1 mmol/L etoposide) and 8 h
in vivo (0.075 mmol/L etoposide only; P < 0.001), indicating
increased cytotoxicity (ANOVA on arcsine transformed data;
Fig. 1). LDH activity increased at 18 h of treatment in vitro
(0–0.1 mmol/L etoposide) and 20 to 24 h treatment in vivo
(0.075 mmol/L etoposide only) using etoposide and indicating
decreased cytotoxicity. Treatment of leukemic clam hemocytes
for 8 h with mitoxantrone in vivo (0.07 mmol/L mitoxantrone)
resulted in increased cytotoxicity. After treatment for 20 h, cytotoxicity decreased, followed by an increase at 24 h of treatment.
In vitro treatment with mitoxantrone (0–0.07 mmol/L mitoxantrone) resulted no changes in these variables (P = 0.087).
Nuclear clam p53 increased after treatment with 0.07 mmol/L
mitoxantrone in vivo (P = 0.047), whereas in vitro treatment with
this drug had no effect (Kruskal-Wallis followed by Bonferroni test;
Fig. 2). Both in vitro and in vivo treatments with etoposide (0.075
mmol/L) resulted in increased nuclear clam p53. This result was
most pronounced during in vivo treatment.
After treatment of leukemic clam hemocytes with etoposide
in vitro and in vivo, the Comet assay indicated increased DNA
fragmentation, whereas treatment with mitoxantrone yielded DNA
fragmentation in vivo only (Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 3A and B).
DNA fragmentation was notably higher in leukemic clam
hemocytes treated with etoposide in vitro. After treatment with
mitoxantrone and etoposide, apoptotic leukemic clam hemocytes
increased both in vitro and in vivo. However, apoptosis occurred
less frequently after treatment with mitoxantrone than after
treatment with etoposide (Mann-Whitney test; Fig. 3C and D).
Percentages of apoptotic leukemic clam hemocytes were significantly lower when assessed by observations of Romanovskystained cells than by the TUNEL assay. Analysis by Romanovsky
staining detects apoptosis at a later stage when leukemic clam
hemocytes are forming internal vesicles; the more sensitive TUNEL
assay provides a quantitative estimate of apoptotic DNA damage at
an earlier stage and yields a significantly higher estimate for
apoptotic leukemic clam hemocytes.
After transfection of leukemic clam hemocytes with the nuclear
pore blocker WGA followed by etoposide treatment, p53 was
found only in the cytoplasm of leukemic clam hemocytes and was
not transported into the nucleus, and no increase in apoptotic
cells was noted (data not shown). Frequencies of apoptotic cells
were lower in leukemic clam hemocytes pretreated with WGA
(15.3%) than in hemocytes treated directly with 0.075 mmol/L
etoposide (74.4%).
Expression of p53 did not differ between untreated normal and
leukemic clam hemocytes. In leukemic clam hemocytes treated

Results for clam p53 distribution for a
total of 200 leukemic clam hemocytes
are subdivided into three different scoring
categories: leukemic clam hemocytes
with predominantly nuclear clam
p53, leukemic clam hemocytes with
predominantly cytoplasmic clam 53, and
leukemic clam hemocytes where the
intracellular distribution of clam p53 was
undetermined. Map53 = clam p53 (48).

In the present study, we use genotoxic stress to promote
transcription of de novo wild-type p53, translocation of p53 to the
nucleus, and apoptosis of leukemic clam hemocytes. The apoptotic
outcome can be prevented after transfection with the nuclear pore
blocker WGA. Although cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 occurs in
a variety of human cancers, no one has previously linked treatment
with these topoisomerase II poisons to reversal of mortalin-based
cytoplasmic sequestration and apoptotic death of cancer cells in
any organism.
Mortalin is a member of the Hsp70 family of proteins that is
not up-regulated by heat. In mammals, it functions in mitochondrial import, energy generation, chaperoning of misfolded
proteins, as a stress sensor, and is involved in carcinogenesis
and old age disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and
Huntington’s diseases; ref. 9). We have identified two variants of
mortalin in the clam, a full-length and a truncated variant. Both
contain an NH2-terminal mitochondrial localization signal and a
p53 binding site, but the truncated variant is missing amino acids
represented by exon 3, which contain ATP binding and ATPase
functions necessary for releasing p53 from binding. Both variants
are complexed in the cytoplasm of leukemic clam hemocytes with
p53. At this point, it is unclear if either overexpressed variant is
exclusively responsible for sequestering p53 in the cytoplasm of
leukemic clam hemocytes. Although both variants of mortalin are
also minimally up-regulated after treatment with etoposide,
mortalin-based cytoplasmic tethering mechanism is apparently
still overwhelmed, allowing nuclear translocation of untethered
clam p53.

with etoposide, p53 was overexpressed 602-fold compared with
untreated leukemic hemocytes, which showed higher expression
than normal clam hemocytes by 30% (Table 1). When transfected
with the nuclear pore blocker WGA, followed by treatment with
etoposide, p53 was overexpressed 893-fold compared with
untreated normal clam hemocytes. Expression of mortalin differed
between normal and leukemic clam hemocytes by 1,634 and 619
times for the long and short versions respectively. Additional
increase of mortalin expression was observed in leukemic clam
hemocytes treated with etoposide by 204-fold for the long variant
and 159-fold for the short variant.

Discussion
Nongenotoxic and genotoxic strategies for reactivating p53
function are of high interest because they may lead to promising
cancer therapies (23, 26–28). Based on an understanding of the
normal p53-mediated pathway for suppressing cancer induction,
strategies for reactivating p53 have been proposed. Among others,
these include stabilizing p53 using small molecule Mdm2
antagonists (e.g., nutlins; refs. 29–32) and inducing de novo
expression of p53 after DNA damage resulting from genotoxic
stress or gene therapy (33–35).
Previous studies in humans and clams have shown that the
cationic inhibitor of mortalin, MKT-077, competes with mortalin
for p53 binding and results in translocation of p53 to the nucleus
followed by rapid apoptosis (8, 36, 37). Use of this small molecule
does not induce DNA damage or elevate transcription of p53.

hemocytes. Frequency of DNA-damaged
cells (Comet assay; %) of leukemic

DNA damage. Large graphs, results

data and frequency of apoptotic cells

was determined by the development of
intracellular vacuoles and the degree
of nuclear fluorescence, respectively.
Analysis by Romanovsky staining detects
apoptosis at a much later stage
when leukemic clam hemocytes are
forming internal vesicles and is qualitative;
the more sensitive TUNEL assay provides
a quantitative estimate of DNA damage
at an earlier stage of apoptosis and, thus,
detects a greater number of apoptotic
leukemic clam hemocytes. Both results
were expressed as a percentage of
100 cells counted.

(44). Mdm2 levels may be low or nonexistent anyway because
cytoplasmically sequestered p53 was not originally present in the
nucleus to induce transcription of this gene. After treatment with
topoisomerase II poisons, other proteins up-regulated by p53mediated transcription would be active in evaluating and repairing
DNA or, failing that, in inducing apoptosis of leukemic clam
hemocytes with severely damaged DNA. This condition would
simplify the p53-mediated response, leading to the rapid apoptosis
of leukemic clam hemocytes that we have observed. We saw limited
evidence (15%) for transcription-independent initiation of apoptosis

Etoposide forms a complex between DNA and DNA topoisomerase II, resulting in decreased DNA religation and strand breaks
(38) and secondary cancers can result (39, 40). Overexpression of
wild-type p53 facilitates etoposide-induced death of cancer cells in
human colon carcinoma cell lines (HCT116 and RKO; ref. 3). In the
current study, treatment of leukemic clam hemocytes with etoposide
resulted in DNA damage and increased expression of clam p53
followed by nuclear translocation of some p53 and apoptosis.
Mitoxantrone causes crosslinking and DNA strand breaks and
interferes with the function of DNA toposiomerase II and with DNA
repair. Mitoxantrone kills both proliferating and nonproliferating
cells (41, 42). In the current study, mitoxantrone was minimally
effective at reversing cytoplasmic sequestration of clam p53 in vivo
and had no obvious effects in vitro. Discrepancies between data
acquired in vivo and in vitro for mammalian cells derived from the
same source tissues are common in preclinical pharmacokinetic
studies (22).
The most attractive interpretation of our data is that treatment
with etoposide and mitoxantrone poisons elevates p53 levels in the
cytoplasm of leukemic clam hemocytes, and that de novo p53
protein overwhelms mortalin tethering, resulting in nuclear
translocation of some p53 followed by cytotoxicity, DNA damage,
and apoptosis of leukemic clam hemocytes. Upon entering the
nucleus after etoposide or mitoxantrone treatment, de novo clam
p53 may be phosphorylated and stabilized by ATM that senses
DNA damage induced by these drugs (43). Such stabilization would
effectively increase the intranuclear concentration of p53 because
Mdm2 could not bind p53 at its TAD and p53 would not be subject
to Mdm2-induced ubiquination and digestion by 26S proteosomes

via transport to the mitochondria when cells were treated with WGA
followed by etoposide (45). Under these conditions, it is likely that,
de novo p53 mRNA is retained in the nucleus and that additional p53
protein is not produced (46). Finally, when mortalin is overexpressed
and tethers p53 in the cytoplasm of leukemic clam hemocytes, the
interaction of p53 with BCL2 or other antiapoptotic molecules at
the mitochondria may be restricted or absent, curtailing, or preventing this alternative apoptotic induction pathway (9, 47).
