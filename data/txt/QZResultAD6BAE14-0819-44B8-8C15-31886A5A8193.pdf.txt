BACKGROUND: The authors have previously reported 2 consecutive phase 2 trials in patients with early breast cancer that overexpresses human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) to assess the feasibility of incorporating anti-HER2 therapies into dosedense (dd) chemotherapy regimens. The incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF) at a median follow-up of 2 years was 1.4% and
3.2%, respectively. METHODS: In trial A, patients received dd doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC)!paclitaxel (T) (each given every 2 weeks) 3 4 with trastuzumab (H) given 3 1 year. In trial B, weekly T (weekly 3 12) was substituted for ddT and lapatinib 3 1 year
was added. Herein, the authors report the longer-term incidence of CHF and distant disease-free survival (DDFS). RESULTS: From
January 2005 to May 2008, 165 patients enrolled (median age, 46 years, with a median left ventricular ejection fraction of 68%
[range, 52%-81%]), 17%of whom had previous hypertension. With a median follow-up of 84 months (trial A) and 57 months (trial B), 1
additional patient developed CHF. Therefore, the cumulative incidence of CHF was 1.4% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.36%7.7%) for trial A and 4.2% (95% CI, 4.2%-10.4%) for trial B. The 5-year DDFS for trials A and B was 92% (95% CI, 83%-97%) and 89%
(95% CI, 81%-94%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Longer follow-up of these 2 studies has demonstrated that ddAC!TH only or
with lapatinib is associated with a low risk of CHF and promising DDFS in patients with early breast cancer. Cancer 2013;119:3943-51.

INTRODUCTION
The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy has improved outcomes in patients with early breast cancer that overexpresses the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). However, in phase 3 studies, this approach was associated
with an increased risk ( 4%) of congestive heart failure (CHF), particularly in patients who receive prior therapy with
anthracyclines.1-4 Parallel to this development, several studies have shown that in patients unselected for HER2 status,
dose-dense (every 2 weeks) anthracycline-taxane therapy improved survival compared with conventionally scheduled therapy (every 3 weeks).5-8 Dose-dense therapy does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of cardiotoxicity.5,6,9
For example, in the pivotal Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9741 study, the incidence of grade 3 and 4 cardiac
dysfunction (CTCAE) in patients receiving dose-dense therapy was numerically less than one-half that of patients
randomized to every-3-weeks therapy (1% vs 2.5%) and highly unlikely to be increased.6
In an attempt to optimize treatment approaches for patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer, we conducted
consecutive phase 2 trials to assess the feasibility and cardiac safety of incorporating anti-HER2 therapies into dose-dense
anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. First, in a single-institution phase 2 study (trial A), we demonstrated that

trastuzumab (H) could safely be added to a regimen of
dose-dense paclitaxel (T) after completion of dose-dense
doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC)!.10 Second,
we performed a similar multicenter study (trial B) investigating the feasibility of adding the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib (L) to a similar regimen of dose-dense
AC!weekly T (AC!THL).11 Per protocol, this
approach was deemed to be not feasible because of the
high rate of diarrhea noted during therapy with THL.11
However, in a combined exploratory analysis of these
studies, there was no evidence of an increased short-term
risk of cardiotoxicity with the use of sequential dosedense, anthracycline-based chemotherapy and anti-HER2
therapies.9-11 In fact, in trial A at a median follow-up of
28 months, 1 of 70 patients (1.4%) developed CHF, and
in trial B at a median follow-up of 22 months, 3 of 95
patients (3.2%) developed CHF.10,11 Russell et al, and
Procter et al, reported 2 independent reviews of the cardiac outcomes of the North Central Cancer Treatment
Group (NCCTG) N9831 and National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-31 combined
and HERA (HERceptin Adjuvant) trials, respectively,
and demonstrated that the long-term cardiotoxicity from
an anthracycline-based therapy followed by trastuzumab
was low.12-15 To investigate whether the same pattern
would exist with the use of dose-dense chemotherapy with
anti-HER2 therapy, we conducted a retrospective review
to examine the long-term incidence of New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class III=IV CHF and disease control rates in patients treated on these two phase 2 studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
As previously described, patients were eligible for both trials if they had HER2-positive tumors, defined as a score
of 31 by immunohistochemistry or amplified by fluorescence in situ hybridization, irrespective of tumor size or
lymph node status.10,11 Eligibility requirements also
included normal hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. For trial A (dose-dense AC!TH), the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by multigated acquisition
(MUGA) scan had to be  55%. The minimum LVEF
for enrollment was subsequently lowered to  50% for
trial B (dose-dense AC!THL). In both trials, patients
with a known history of unstable angina, a myocardial infarction within the past 12 months, CHF, a serious medical illness, the inability to provide consent, or those who
were pregnant were excluded. Patients were not excluded
on the basis of chronic cardiovascular disease such as
hypertension. All patients gave informed consent and the
3944

studies were approved by the individual Institutional
Review Boards of each institution.
In trial A, patients received adjuvant=neoadjuvant
AC (60=600 mg=m2) every 2 weeks 3 4 cycles followed
by T (175 mg=m2) every 2 weeks 3 4 cycles with H followed by H to complete 1 year of treatment (Fig. 1). Trial
B differed in that it substituted weekly T (80 mg=m2)
3 12 and added lapatinib (L) (1000 mg orally daily) 3 1
year (Fig. 1). In both trials, LVEF was assessed by MUGA
scans serially at baseline and at 2 months, 6 months, 9
months, and 18 months and H was temporarily held or
discontinued based on protocol-defined rules as previously
reported.9
Thereafter, cardiac monitoring was not mandated
per protocol but was performed for clinical indications. In
addition, at any time point, patients with an asymptomatic LVEF decline underwent additional evaluation with a
MUGA scan or an echocardiogram as defined in the protocol. Patients with symptoms consistent with CHF
underwent similar investigations as per standard clinical
practice at the discretion of the investigators.
For this analysis, electronic medical records were
examined and clinically documented instances of CHF
were recorded. In addition, LVEF data were extracted
from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center reports
and outside institutions from all available time points. Efficacy outcome was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier
method using the Standardized Definitions for Efficacy
End Points (STEEP) definition of distant disease-free survival (DDFS).16 Because patients with a history of breast
cancer were generally seen approximately once every 12
months (6 3 months) after the first few years of followup, any patients who were alive with no follow-up data
within the last 15 months were determined to be “lost to
follow-up” for the purposes of this analysis (N 5 10). For
these patients, cardiac safety data and survival were censored at last follow-up date.
RESULTS
From January 2005 to May 2008, trial A enrolled 70
patients and trial B enrolled 95 patients (Fig. 2). Therefore, a total of 165 patients with a median age of 46 years
(range, 27 years-73 years) were included in the current
analysis (Table 1). Overall, 38% of the patients had stage
III disease (AJCC Cancer Staging System), although more
patients in trial B had higher-stage disease (stage III: 43%
vs 30%). In total, 17% of the entire cohort (N 5 165) had
preexisting hypertension. At the time of last follow-up,
150 of the 165 patients had no evidence of disease, 7
patients were alive with metastatic disease, and 8 patients

had died (Fig. 2). Of the 7 patients with metastatic disease, none were known to have developed CHF. Six
patients died of metastatic breast cancer and, as previously
described, 2 patients died during treatment (1 from viral

We previously reported short-term changes in LVEF
(from baseline to month 6) in a combined analysis that
included all 165 patients treated on these studies.9 In
addition, we described LVEF separately at protocoldefined time points from both trial A (N 5 70) and trial
B (N 5 95).10,11 For the 165 patients in the current
analysis, the baseline median LVEF was 68% (range,
52%-81%). At 18 months, we had LVEF data for 112
patients (68%) (Table 2). Of the 70 patients in trial A,
60 (86%) completed 18-month assessments. Only 1
patient in trial A (1.4%) developed CHF (as described
previously) and 5 patients (7%) had no further imaging
after month 9.10

In trial B, nearly one-half of the patients (41%)
withdrew during treatment with THL due to toxicities
(mainly diarrhea).11 Per protocol, these patients were
expected to continue follow-up cardiac imaging; however,
many declined. Overall, of the 95 patients in trial B, 52
patients (55%) had LVEF assessment at month 18. Two
patients (2.0%) with CHF did not obtain the 18-month
assessment and 23 patients (24%) had no LVEF assessment after month 9. Figure 3 shows a combined analysis
of LVEF in patients from both trials (N 5 165) from all
available time points up to month 18, including those
patients with cardiac symptoms and those with asymptomatic declines in LVEF. It is interesting to note that
LVEF was similar in women with a history of hypertension (N 5 28) and those without (N 5 137). The median
baseline LVEF was 70% (range, 56%-81%) and 67%
(range, 52%-81%), respectively, in patients with and
without hypertension. Similarly, the median LVEF at 18
3946

months was 65% (range, 30%-72%) and 65% (range,
45%-78%), respectively, in patients with (N 5 19) and
without (N 5 93) hypertension.
NYHA Class III=IV CHF

At a median follow-up of 84 months, no additional
NYHA grade III or IV cardiac events were reported to
occur in patients in trial A; thus, the cardiac event rate
remains at 1.4% (95% CI, 1.36%-7.7%). At a median
follow-up of 56 months in trial B, 1 additional patient
reportedly developed CHF; thus, the cardiac event rate
was 4.2% (95% CI, 1.2%-10.4%). There have been no
cardiac deaths reported in either trial at the time of last
follow-up.

smoker with stage I breast cancer and no history of hypertension or family history of cardiovascular disease who
presented with dyspnea and a decrease in LVEF to 45% at
month 4. She was treated with a diuretic, a b-blocker, and
an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and,
as per protocol, discontinued trastuzumab with subsequent recovery of her LVEF to 50% at month 10, 55% at
month 16, and 58% at month 26. She remained clinically
well at the time of last follow-up.
In trial B (dose-dense AC!THL), patient 2 (LVEF

CHF at month 3. She was a 44-year-old nonsmoker with
no history of hypertension or family history of cardiovascular disease who developed dyspnea with an LVEF
decrease to 48% at month 3. She discontinued trastuzumab, never initiated lapatinib, and demonstrated a clinical
improvement. Her LVEF recovered to 62% at 26 months,
but she was found to have bone metastases at month 39
and died of metastatic disease shortly thereafter.

and a diuretic and discontinued treatment with THL.
Her symptoms improved, and she completed right-sided

implantable cardioverter defibrillator. At the time of last
follow-up, she was reported to have stable CHF, with persistently low LVEFs (25% and 30%, respectively, at
months 8 and 19) and was being maintained on a bblocker, digoxin, a diuretic, and an ACE inhibitor.
In trial B (dose-dense AC!THL), patient 4 (LVEF
of > 70%, > 70%, 62%, and 58%, respectively, at baseline, month 2, month 6, and month 10) was diagnosed
with CHF at month 12. She was a 64-year-old smoker
with a history of hypertension and a family history of cardiovascular disease who developed severe dyspnea and a
decreased LVEF of 25% at month 12. She was treated
with a diuretic, a b-blocker, an a-blocker, and an ACE inhibitor, and received anticoagulation therapy for a coexisting pulmonary embolism. She discontinued trastuzumab
and improved clinically, although at the time of last
follow-up she was reported to have had several subsequent
hospitalizations for exacerbation of CHF and her LVEF
had not recovered significantly (30% and 27%, respectively, at months 18 and 24).
In trial B (dose-dense AC!THL), patient 5 (LVEF
of 59% and 56%, respectively, at baseline and month 2)
was diagnosed with CHF at month 44. She was a 44-yearold smoker with a history of hypertension, left bundle
branch block, and a family history of cardiovascular disease, for which she was followed by a cardiologist. She
developed peripheral vein thrombosis and was found to
have an asymptomatic decline in LVEF (to 35%) during
treatment with THL at month 4. Repeat LVEF at month
5 was 45% and anti-HER2 therapy was discontinued.

Breast Cancer Outcome

At a median follow-up of 84 months in trial A, the median
DDFS has not been reached. The 3-year, 4-year, and 5year DDFS rates were 95% (95% CI, 87%-99%), 95%
(95% CI, 87%-99%), and 92% (95% CI, 83%-97%),
respectively (Fig. 4A). At a median follow-up of 56
months in trial B, the median DDFS had also not been
reached. The 3-year, 4-year, and 5-year DDFS rates were
93% (95% CI, 85%-96%), 89% (95% CI, 81%-94%),
and 89% (95% CI, 81%-94%), respectively (Fig. 4B). It
is interesting to note that none of the 31 patients with
stage I HER2-positive breast cancer (19%) had developed
metastatic disease at the time of last follow-up.
DISCUSSION
Longer follow-up of these two phase 2 studies demonstrated that the addition of lapatinib as a component of
dose-dense adjuvant therapy using AC-TH did not
3948

change the regimen’s low risk of CHF, which remained
consistent with the data generated in the larger randomized trials of adjuvant HER2-directed therapy.17,18
Romond et al, from the NSABP B-31 trial, recently
reported the 7-year follow-up and demonstrated that the
cardiac event rate was still 4.0% with the addition of trastuzumab to AC!T, and late cardiac events were rare.17
As was true in the randomized studies, the majority of
events occurred during active therapy, and in our cohorts
we observed only 1 additional cardiac event at month 44
in a patient in trial B.10,11,17,18 Furthermore, an exploratory analysis indicated that these regimens were associated
with excellent disease control.
Despite a priori concerns that dose-dense scheduling
would be associated with unacceptable increases in cardiac
risk when combined with anti-HER2 therapies, we
observed a low cardiac event with both single and dual targeting of HER2. Although we observed 1 additional case
of NYHA class III=IV CHF in the combined analysis of
these two phase 2 studies, this low cardiac event rate of
 4% did not suggest any increased risk when using a
dose-dense chemotherapy regimen including anthracyclines and taxanes.13,14 By way of comparison, in the
NSABP B-31 trial, the cumulative incidence of CHF rose
from 2.6% at month 6 to 3.6% at month 12 and then plateaued at 4.1% at months 24 and 36.12 It is interesting to
note that the patients who developed CHF were relatively
young (aged 35 years, 44 years, 44 years, 56 years, and 64
years), with minimal cardiac risk factors, a finding that
contrasted with the previous suggestion that age was associated with increased cardiotoxicity in this setting.12,17,19
However, definitive conclusions are limited by the small
numbers of patients in this report, and the resultant 95%
CIs are wide. In the recent 7-year update from the NSABP
B-31 trial, the incidence of cardiac events remained low,
with a plateau noted between years 2 and 7 from the initiation of treatment.12,17 At the same time, we acknowledge that neither our studies nor the larger phase 3 trials
had adequate long-term follow-up to exclude late events.
Therefore, continued observation of all these patients is
critical in determining the long-term effects of these therapies. For patients treated with anthracycline-based adjuvant therapy, Pinder et al reported claims-based data
demonstrating that by 10 years, there was a substantially
increased risk of overt CHF after treatment and that this
risk was further increased with the addition of anti-HER2
therapy.20 Other groups have reported similar data in the
elderly patient population with follow-up as far as 5
years.21-23 However, claims-based data collection is inherently imperfect for various reasons, including reporting

biases. Thus, detailed information regarding cardiac outcomes after longer-term follow-up is needed. Such analyses might include potential cardiac biomarkers as
predictors of cardiac toxicity, acknowledging that the data
regarding their usefulness for shorter-term follow-up are
mixed.24,25
With regard to the outcomes, the results of the current study present encouraging results that the 5-year
DDFS was 92% (95% CI, 87%-99%) and 89% (95%
CI, 81%-94%), respectively, for trials A and B. This again
is favorable when compared with the results of the larger
randomized trials. For example, in the combined analysis
of the NCCTG N9831 and NSABP B-31 trials, the 4year disease-free survival rate was 85.7% for patients who
received conventionally scheduled AC!TH,26 and similar results were noted in the HERA trial.27 At a median
follow-up of 8 years, authors from the NSABP B31=NCCTG N9831 and HERA trials have demonstrated
the durable benefit of trastuzumab when added to chemotherapy (8-year DFS rates of 76.8% and 76.0%, respectively) with acceptable cardiac toxicity.18,28 Cross-study
comparisons are not particularly informative, but these
data support the belief that the benefit of trastuzumab
should also be sustained with dose-dense chemotherapy
with an adequately low cardiac toxicity rate.
Several ongoing studies have explored the potentially increased efficacy of adding lapatinib and other antiHER2 agents to trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimens for patients with early breast cancer in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings.29-33 In the preoperative
setting, dual anti-HER2 therapy (with trastuzumab and
lapatinib) led to a near doubling of the pathological complete response rate when compared with trastuzumab
combined with chemotherapy.30,31 However, we are
awaiting the data on long-term disease control from these
neoadjuvant trials and the large phase 3 adjuvant ALTTO
(Adjuvant Lapatinib And=Or Trastuzumab Treatment
Optimisation) study. It will be important to learn whether
the cardiac toxicity and efficacy of lapatinib added to trastuzumab will be comparable to the current study results
from trial B.
With regard to the ongoing controversy regarding
the appropriate adjuvant therapy for patients with HER2positive, lymph node-negative disease, we noted that none
of the 31 patients with stage I HER2-positive breast cancer in either of these trials (19%) had developed metastatic
disease at the time of last follow-up. In the absence of systemic therapy, up to 30% of these patients would be
expected to eventually experience disease recurrence.34
Recent retrospective studies have suggested a possible benCancer

November 15, 2013

efit from the combination of chemotherapy and trastuzumab in this setting for both local and distant disease
control.35,36 In one report, the 3-year distant recurrencefree survival rate for the 106 women not treated with trastuzumab (66% of whom received chemotherapy) was
95% compared with 100% (P 5 .0072) for the 155
patients who received combination chemotherapy with
trastuzumab.35 Moving forward, several anti-HER2based regimens have been evaluated for the treatment of
patients with lymph node-negative disease.1-4,37,38 This
may be a case in which omitting an anthracycline is an
attractive approach because the absolute benefits of this
class of drugs are smaller. Preliminary results from a phase
2 study of docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, and trastuzumab
suggest that this regimen is feasible and associated with a
low risk of early cardiac toxicity.37 In addition, a study of
paclitaxel with trastuzumab in patients with lymph nodenegative disease has been completed and data regarding
cardiac safety as well as efficacy are forthcoming.38
Longer follow-up of patients treated at 2 institutions
on these consecutive phase 2 trials has demonstrated an
acceptably low incidence of CHF, with excellent disease
control. This is clinically relevant given that dose-dense
AC!TH is an appropriate option for patients with
HER2-positive early breast cancer as per the current
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.39
Follow-up of all studies of adjuvant trastuzumab is
ongoing to determine the long-term effects (over several
decades) of these therapies in survivors of breast cancer.
The potential benefit of incorporating lapatinib and other
novel anti-HER2 agents, such as pertuzumab, into standard regimens is the subject of ongoing phase 3 trials. Feasibility studies, such as those reported herein, can inform
the design of such studies and provide additional safety
data using alternative chemotherapy regimens.
