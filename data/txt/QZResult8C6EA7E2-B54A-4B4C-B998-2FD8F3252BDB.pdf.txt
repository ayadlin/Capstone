BACKGROUND: In a retrospective study of Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG)-S8710/INT-0080 (radical cystectomy [RC] alone vs 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy [NC] with methotrexate, vinblastine,
doxorubicin, and cisplatin before RC for bladder cancer), factors found to be associated with improved
overall survival (OS) included pathologic complete response, defined as P0; treatment with NC; completion
of RC with negative surgical margins; and 10 pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) removed. METHODS: The authors
used stratified Cox regression to retrospectively study the association of quality of pathologic response
after RC with OS in the subset of S8710 patients who received NC and RC with negative surgical margins.
RESULTS: Of 154 patients who received NC, 68 (44.2%) were <P2 (P0, Pa, P1, or carcinoma in situ [CIS]) at
RC, 46 (29.9%) were P0, and the remainder had P2þ disease or did not undergo RC. In 115 patients who
had RC with negative surgical margins, compared with P0 patients, those with residual Pa, P1, or CIS
appeared to have worse OS (P ¼ .054); OS was significantly worse for patients with residual P2þ disease
(P ¼ .0006). LN–positive (LNþ) disease was found to be associated with worse OS than LN–negative
(LN) disease (P ¼ .0005). Patients with LN disease (ie, those with <10 LNs removed) appeared to have
inferior OS compared with those with 10þ LNs removed (P ¼ .079). The combination of pre-NC clinical
stage and post-RC pathologic stage was found to be predictive of OS (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: NC and
RC with negative surgical margins for bladder cancer followed by pathologic P0 and LN disease were
found to correlate with improved OS. A combination of baseline clinical stage and post-RC pathologic

Neoadjuvant MVAC for Bladder Cancer/Sonpavde et al

Neoadjuvant treatment with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) chemotherapy was evaluated for patients with locally advanced
bladder cancer (clinical T2 to T4a) treated with radical
cystectomy (RC) in a phase 3 trial (S8710) conducted by
the Southwest Oncology Group.1 A total of 317 patients
were randomized to RC or 3 cycles of MVAC followed by
RC. The median survival among patients assigned to surgery alone was 46 months, compared with 77 months
with MVAC (P ¼ .06). Significantly more patients in the
MVAC group had no residual disease (P0) than patients
in the cystectomy group (38% vs 15%; P < .001). In both
groups, improved survival was associated with P0 disease,
with the 5-year survival rate for all patients with P0 disease
being an impressive 85%. The International Collaboration of Trialists trial and a meta-analysis have confirmed
the value of neoadjuvant cisplatin-based combination
chemotherapy.2-4 Retrospective analyses of S8710
revealed that survival was associated with neoadjuvant
MVAC, completion of RC, and 10 pelvic lymph nodes
(LNs) removed.5,6 Five-year survival was 81% in patients
treated with neoadjuvant MVAC and RC with 10 LNs
removed (n ¼ 66), 66% in patients treated with RC alone
with 10 LNs removed (n ¼ 60), 55% for those treated
with MVAC and RC with <10 LNs removed (n ¼ 49),
and 39% for those treated with RC alone with <10 LNs
removed (n ¼ 44). Pooled across treatment arms, the 5year survival of patients with positive surgical margins (n
¼ 25) and those who did not undergo RC (n ¼ 39) was
dismal at 0% and 11%, respectively. Therefore, both the
quality of surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC)
appeared to impact favorably and independently on
outcomes.
Pathologic complete remission (pCR) with neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer is also highly correlated
with survival. However, the optimal definition of pCR is
unsettled.7-12 When there is no residual invasive cancer in
the breast, the number of involved axillary LNs is inversely
related to survival. Conversely, patients who convert to
LN–negative (LN) status after treatment have excellent
survival, even with residual disease in the breast. To our
knowledge, there is no evidence that residual in situ carcinoma increases risk of distant disease recurrence.13,14 In a
recent retrospective analysis, residual cancer burden calculated after NC for breast cancer as a continuous index
combining primary tumor (size and cellularity) and
Cancer

lymph node (number and size) characteristics for the prediction of distant recurrence–free survival was found to be
independently prognostic in a multivariate model.15 In
another retrospective analysis of women who received
NC, risk stratification of patients was facilitated by the
combination of pretreatment clinical stage and post-therapy pathologic stage.16 S8710 defined pCR as the absence
of all residual bladder cancer (P0). However, residual nonmuscle invasive cancer including carcinoma in situ (CIS),
Pa, and P1 disease may correlate with outcomes similar to
P0 and may differentially impact prognosis compared
with P2þ disease. Similar to breast cancer, outcomes after
NC are likely associated with pretherapy clinical staging
and post-therapy pathologic staging and tumor burden.
Therefore, we planned a retrospective study of the S8710
trial to evaluate the correlation of the quality of pathologic
response with neoadjuvant MVAC and surgical resection
with overall survival (OS).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Retrospective Cohort Study of a
Prospective Trial
We retrospectively studied patients in S8710 who received
neoadjuvant MVAC chemotherapy and completed RC
with negative surgical margins. The primary goals were to
determine the association between pathologic response
(P0 vs Pa, P1, CIS vs P2þ), pathologic lymph node
involvement, and quality of pelvic lymph node dissection
and OS. In addition, the correlation between a combination of baseline clinical stage and RC pathologic stage and
OS was analyzed.

Statistical Analysis
Associations between various pathologic and clinical features in the subset of S8710 patients who received NC
and RC with negative surgical margins and OS were evaluated using stratified proportional hazards regression.
Baseline clinical T classification (T2 vs T3-4), pathologic
stage at cystectomy (P0 vs Pa/P1/CIS vs P2þ), and number of LNs removed (<10 vs 10þ) were explored as
potential prognostic factors. Because all patients included
in the analysis were treated with RC, Day 0 in these
survival models was defined as the date of cystectomy.

RESULTS
Quality of Pathologic Response With
Neoadjuvant MVAC Appears to Be a
Function of Baseline Stage
Of all 154 patients who received neoadjuvant MVAC, 68
(44%) had <P2 disease (P0, Pa, P1, or CIS) at RC, and
46 (30%) had P0 disease. The remainder of patients
exhibited residual P2 disease or did not undergo RC for
a variety of reasons. Among the 62 (40%) with clinical T2
disease at baseline, 34 (55%) and 24 (39%) were classified
as having <P2 and P0 disease, respectively. Among the 92
(60%) patients with T3 through T4 disease, 32 (35%)
were classified with <P2, and 22 (24%) with P0 disease.
Pathologic Stage at Cystectomy Confers
Prognostic Impact
In the 115 of these 154 patients who underwent RC with
negative surgical margins, several pathologic features were
found to be associated with OS (Table 1). Pathologic
response defined as either P0 or <P2 was predictive of
enhanced OS. The hazard ratio (HR) of OS for >P0 ver4106

sus P0 disease was 2.51 (95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 1.47-4.27; P ¼ .0008), whereas the HR for P2þ versus <P2 disease was 2.24 (95% CI, 1.34-3.76; P ¼
.0022). Compared with P0 patients, those with residual
Pa, P1, or CIS appeared to have worse OS (Fig. 1), but
the difference did not quite achieve statistical significance
(HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 0.99-4.24 [P ¼ .054]), whereas OS
was found to be significantly worse for patients with residual P2þ disease (HR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.54-4.89 [P ¼
.0006]). Pathologic LN–positive (LNþ) disease was
found to be associated with worse OS than LN) disease
(HR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.59-5.28 [P ¼ .0005]) (Fig. 2).
Quality of LN Dissection Has
Prognostic Value

removed) appeared to have inferior OS compared with

patients in whom 10þ LNs were removed, although this
result was not statistically significant (HR, 1.66; 95% CI,
0.94-2.90 [P ¼ .079]) (Fig. 3). The median OS was 7.2
years for patients with <10 LNs removed versus 13.7
years for patients with 10 LNs removed.
Combination of Baseline Clinical Stage and
Post-MVAC Pathologic Stage as a
Prognostic Factor
The combination of baseline clinical stage and post-RC
pathologic stage (<P2 vs P2þ) was found to be prognostic for OS (Fig. 4). Among patients with initial T2 disease,
the presence of P2þ disease after RC was found to be
associated with a >7-fold higher risk of death than <P2
disease (Table 1).

DISCUSSION
Among patients treated with NC and RC with negative
surgical margins for bladder cancer, pathologic P0 and
LN disease at RC was found to correlate with improved
OS. Compared with patients with P0 disease, those with
residual Pa, P1, or CIS appeared to have worse OS, and
those with P2þ disease had a significantly worse OS. A
combination of baseline clinical stage and post-RC pathologic stage may better predict OS. Because positive surgical margins and lack of RC were found to be correlated
with dismal outcomes in a previous retrospective analysis
of all patients enrolled in the S8710 trial, we conducted
this analysis only in those patients who underwent a complete RC with negative surgical margins.5,6 Although this
retrospective analysis is limited because of the modest

number of patients studied, it suggests that residual pathologic stage after neoadjuvant MVAC is associated with
postcystectomy survival in patients who undergo RC with
negative surgical margins. Progression-free survival could
not be analyzed because of the inadequate capture of this
endpoint in the prospective trial. Furthermore, because of
the very long follow-up time now available for these
patients, a large number of non–cancer-related deaths
may have been captured in this analysis. Therefore, the
hazard ratio estimates presented herein may represent
conservative estimates of the true association between survival and pathologic and clinical stage. In addition, the
original pathology slides and specimens were not available
for a more detailed analysis of residual tumor volume.
Central pathology review was performed for the initial tumor biopsy, but not for the cystectomy specimen. Among
patients with LN disease, those with more extensive LN
dissection were found to have superior outcomes,
although this result was not statistically significant. Similar findings have been reported elsewhere in RC patients
who did not receive NC.17 The prognostic impact of the
number of LNs removed in patients with LNþ disease
was not analyzed, because there were few patients in this
category (n ¼ 17), and the dismal OS of patients with
LNþ disease was already known.
Patients with lower baseline clinical stage (T2)
achieved subsequent major pathologic response (<P2)
more often (73%) than those with T3 through T4 disease
(49%). Baseline T2 disease followed by <P2 at RC was
associated with the best post-RC survival, whereas those
with T2 disease and subsequent residual muscle-invasive

disease (P2þ) were found to have the worst outcomes,
and may represent patients with chemoresistant disease,
although this result is based on a small subset (n ¼ 13)
and therefore must be interpreted with caution. Tumor
biology is most likely the underlying factor driving the
chemoresponsiveness in addition to initial clinical stage,
but tumor genomics and proteomics could not be evaluated on the current study. Because a proportion of
patients with T2 disease may attain <P2 residual stage
with the initial cystoscopic biopsy or transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT), an independent
impact of optimal TURBT on OS may also be occurring
in patients receiving MVAC. Therefore, all the benefit
may not be attributable to NC. However, the extent of
TURBT required or performed was not defined or available in the current study, which also hampers the evaluation of its impact. Urologists should most likely still
perform an optimal TURBT in patients with T2 disease
who may receive NC. Studies support some breast cancers
being generally sensitive to different classes of chemotherapy, whereas others may be intrinsically resistant to different classes of chemotherapy.18,19 This finding in the
setting of breast cancer may be applicable to the bladder
cancer setting. The data from the current study are hypothesis generating, and with further validation they may
assist in optimally risk-stratifying patients enrolled in
future trials of adjuvant therapy with potentially non–
cross-resistant biologic agents based on pathologic stage of
residual disease after NC.
Although adjuvant chemotherapy has been evaluated for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, to our knowledge definitive data from large randomized trials have not
been available.20-23 In addition, a recent retrospective
study demonstrated that approximately 30% of patients
who underwent radical cystectomy developed complications within 90 days that could contraindicate adjuvant
chemotherapy.24 Response to neoadjuvant MVAC may
also be predicted by genomic and proteomic analysis of
tumor tissue obtained at baseline biopsy. Fourteen genes
were found to be predictive of pCR in a retrospective
study of patients with bladder cancer who received neoadjuvant MVAC.25,26 Among those genes, topoisomerase
IIa (target of doxorubicin) was down-regulated in the
nonresponder group. A correlation was found between
low/intermediate BRCA1 mRNA levels (which mediates
DNA repair) and pCR as well as long-term outcomes
4108

with neoadjuvant cisplatin-combination chemotherapy
for bladder cancer in a retrospective study of 49
patients.27 In the setting of neoadjuvant therapy of breast
cancer, early modulation of pharmacodynamic biomarkers (eg, Ki-67) after brief neoadjuvant therapy
appears to correlate with long-term clinical outcomes, and
this paradigm needs to be evaluated in bladder cancer.28,29
Thus, the neoadjuvant paradigm holds considerable
promise in the development of tailored therapy for
patients with locally advanced bladder cancer. In addition,
this paradigm has the potential to enable the efficient use
of resources and accelerate the pace of systemic therapy
development because of the availability of pathologic
response as an intermediate endpoint.
