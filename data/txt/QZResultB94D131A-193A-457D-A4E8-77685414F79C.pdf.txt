ABSTRACT:
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by a typical defect in
apoptosis and is still an incurable disease. Numerous apoptosis inducers have been
described. These synthetic compounds and natural products (mainly derived from
plants) display antileukemic properties in vitro and in vivo and some have even been
tested in the clinic in CLL. They act through several different mechanisms. Most of
them involve proteins of the Bcl-2 family, which are the key regulators in triggering
the mitochondrial pathway of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Thus, the Mcl-1/Noxa
axis appeared as a target. Here I overview natural and synthetic apoptosis inducers
and their mechanisms of action in CLL cells. Opportunities for developing novel,
apoptosis-based therapeutics are presented.

1. INTRODUCTION

by Bcl-2 family proteins (that share at least one of the
four Bcl-2 homology domains, BH1 to 4). The prosurvival
members of the family (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1 and
A1) sequester the proapoptotic members Bax and Bak.
Upon stimulation, the family’s BH3-only members (socalled because they only have the BH3 domain) Bim,
Puma, Bid, Bad, Noxa, etc., bind to and antagonize the
prosurvival proteins. The sequestered Bax and Bak are
thus released from their prosurvival ligands and then
activated. There is another activation pathway in which
Bax and Bak are directly activated by certain BH3-only
proteins [3]. In any event, the activation of Bax and
Bak induces pore formation at the outer mitochondrial
membrane. The resulting membrane permeabilization
favors the cytoplasmic release of apoptogenic factors,
including cytochrome c. The latter interacts with the
adapter Apaf-1 which enables the initiator caspase-9 to be
activated. In turn, caspases-8 and -9 trigger the activation
of effector caspases. These proteases can be inactivated
by endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAP). The
IAP antagonist Second mitochondria-derived activator of
caspases (Smac) is one of the apoptogenic factors released
from the mitochondria [3]. Furthermore, several signaling
pathways are known to interfere indirectly with apoptosis:
these include the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) pathway,
which activates the transcription of antiapoptotic proteins
(such as Mcl-1 and IAPs) or the phosphatidylinositol-3kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway that phosphorylates several

Apoptosis is a physiological cell suicide program
that is essential for the regulation of development,
the maintenance of homeostasis and the prevention of
tumorigenesis. Evading the apoptotic program is one
of the hallmarks of cancer and represents an important
mechanism in clinical resistance to therapies [1,2]. This is
particularly true for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
a currently incurable condition that is clearly characterized
by impaired apoptosis. The development of therapeutic
strategies that target apoptosis in CLL is therefore a very
important issue.

1.1. Pathways in caspase-dependent apoptosis
The apoptotic machinery comprises two main
activation pathways (the extrinsic and the intrinsic
pathways) and an execution phase mediated by proteases
of the caspase family [3]. The extrinsic pathway (also
known as the death receptor pathway) is triggered by
ligation of death receptors (TNF-R, Fas, DR4) by their
respective ligands (TNF, Fas L, TRAIL) and recruitment
of adapter molecules, which activates the initiator
caspase-8. The intrinsic pathway (also known as the
mitochondrial pathway) integrates various intracellular
signals at the mitochondrial membrane and is regulated

protein targets of relevance to apoptosis (such as Bad) [4].
Both pathways may thus downregulate caspase-dependent
apoptosis. In contrast, the p53 pathway is an integrator
of cellular stress and is capable of stimulating apoptosis
notably through transcriptional activation of proapoptotic
proteins (e.g., Puma and Noxa).

CLL cells [6,7,11,12]. Indeed, silencing Mcl-1 with small
interfering RNA (siRNA) is enough to induce apoptosis
in CLL cells [13]. Other signaling pathways are also
involved in the overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins
in CLL cells: for example, B cell receptor (BCR) signals
reportedly upregulate Mcl-1 expression through the
PI3K/AKT pathway [8]. Lastly, alterations in apoptosis
regulators such as p53 (which are frequently observed
in CLL) may be implicated in the defective apoptosis.
A schematic representation of the impaired apoptotic
machinery in CLL cells is shown in Figure 1.

1.2. Defective apoptosis in CLL
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia results from the
clonal expansion of a CD5-positive subpopulation of B
lymphocytes which progressively accumulate in the bone
marrow, lymph nodes and peripheral blood. Although
proliferative pools in the bone marrow and lymph nodes
probably feed the blood compartment, the leukemic
cells in the blood are quiescent but are unable to initiate
their apoptotic program. This situation is due to several
factors including defects in the CLL cells’ apoptotic
machinery and excessive survival signals delivered by
the microenvironment [5-9]. Bone marrow stroma cells,
nurse-like cells and T cells produce chemokines and
cytokines that activate survival pathways such as NF-kB
or PI3K/AKT. Indeed, these pathways are constitutively
activated in CLL cells and this leads to the transcription
and overexpression of key antiapoptotic proteins (notably
several members of the Bcl-2 and IAP families). X-linked
IAP (XIAP) appears to be the IAP that has a major role in
caspase inactivation [10]. Regarding the prosurvival Bcl-2
proteins, it is now well established that in addition to Bcl2 itself, Mcl-1 is a crucial player in impaired apoptosis in

1.3. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is an incurable
disease
The treatment of CLL patients with combinations
of alkylating agents, purine analogues and monoclonal
antibodies (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab
or allied agents) has significantly increased both the
proportion and duration of complete remissions, and
prolonged the overall survival [14,15]. Nevertheless, the
treatment failure rate is still high and most treatmentresponsive patients subsequently relapse.

1.4. Apoptosis-based strategies for CLL
Various ways of reactivating the apoptotic
machinery in primary CLL cells have been developed
over the past 15 years as extensively reviewed [5,8,16].

Antiapoptotic factors are colored in red and proapoptotic components are colored in blue. Constitutive activation of survival pathways by
microenvironment signals and B cell receptor signaling leads to the transcriptional activation of prosurvival factors from the Bcl-2 and IAP
families which are thus overexpressed in CLL cells. The increased antiapoptotic activity exerted by these factors results in (i) sequestration
of the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak (which thus prevents the mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the subsequent cascade
of caspase activation) and (ii) direct inhibition of caspase activities by IAP proteins. Moreover, deficiencies in the p53 apoptotic pathway
(which are frequently observed in CLL) reduce the expression of BH3-only proteins like Puma and Noxa (known to block the antiapoptotic
activity of prosurvival Bcl-2 family members and promote Bax and Bak activation). IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein; NF-kB, nuclear

These approaches include inhibition of NF-kB or PI3K/
AKT pathways (using for example CAL-101, a PI3Kdelta
isoform), enhancement of p53-dependent apoptosis
(using nutlin-3a or inhibitors of poly[ADP-ribose]
polymerase-1), stimulation of the extrinsic pathway
through the death receptors, interference with BCR
signaling (using notably dasatinib, a Lyn kinase inhibitor
and the Syk inhibitor fostamatinib) or with survival signals
delivered by the leukemic microenvironment (particularly
lenalidomide that repairs the T cell immunologic synapse
defect, and CXCR4 targeting using plerixafor), novel
chemotherapeutics (e.g. bendamustine, forodesine,
acadesine) and monoclonal antibodies. However, the most
extensively studied approach has been the identification
of agents capable of directly triggering the intrinsic
mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. This prompted the
discovery of the in vitro apoptosis inducers reviewed in
the present article.

Flavopiridol
Flavopiridol is a semisynthetic flavone derived
from rohitukine (an alkaloid isolated from Indian plants).
Its chemical structure is shown in Figure 2. To the best
of our knowledge, this flavonoid was the first apoptosis
inducer to be identified in CLL cells [17] and is still one
of the most potent. Flavopiridol acts by downregulating
the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and XIAP through
inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) required
for RNA polymerase II activation [18]. Consequently,
transcription of many short-lived proteins is decreased
resulting in downregulation of key proteins such as
Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, several IAP (XIAP, c-IAP-2, survivin),
C-Myc (a transcriptional activator of Mcl-1), Mdm-2 (a
p53 antagonist) and p21 [19]. Flavopiridol’s effects on
transcription are therefore not specific but do affect a large
number of proteins. It is noteworthy that the decrease in
Bcl-2 mRNA does not change Bcl-2 protein levels. The
initial clinical trials of various flavopiridol regimens
in CLL gave disappointing results, probably because
the flavonoid is strongly bound by plasma proteins
[20]. More successful outcomes were recorded with a
pharmacologically-based dosing schedule in a Phase II
trial on refractory and genetically high-risk CLL patients,
providing more than 50% of responses and improvements
in progression-free survival [21]. However, dose-

escalation is difficult because of the lack of predictive
markers for toxicity. Flavopiridol is currently investigated
in combination with other agents and as a means of
eradicating residual disease after chemotherapy [20].

translation is not critical for the proapoptotic effects of
the compounds and that they act via several different
cell death mechanisms [29]. Silvestrol has shown in vivo
antileukemic activity in the TCL-1 transgenic mouse
model of human CLL [28]. Interestingly, sorafenib
(a multikinase inhibitor) induces CLL cell death by
translational downregulation of Mcl-1 [30].

Other CDK inhibitors
Other CDK inhibitors are capable of inducing CLL
cell apoptosis via the inhibition of Mcl-1 transcription:
they include the natural compound roscovitine/seliciclib
(a starfish-derived alkaloid) [22] and the synthetic agents
SNS-032 and dinaciclib [23,24]. The latter two agents are
currently in clinical evaluation in CLL. Like flavopiridol,
several other plant-derived flavones such as apigenin
(Figure 2) are CDK inhibitors that induce apoptosis by
transcriptional suppression of Mcl-1 [25]. This property
might contribute to apigenin’s proapoptotic effects on CLL
cells [26], although other mechanisms also play important
roles (see below).

Specific inhibitors of Bcl-2 family protein expression
Whereas CDK inhibitors and translational inhibitors
do not selectively target antiapoptotic molecules, specific
inhibition of Bcl-2 protein expression can be envisaged
because Mcl-1 siRNA is capable of triggering CLL cell
apoptosis in vitro [13]. However, technical obstacles
currently prevent the RNA interference approach
from being applied in the clinic [31]. The clinical
development of short hairpin RNA mimicking endogenous
microinterfering RNA (miR) appears to be even more
difficult to apply [32] whereas the loss of miR-15a1
and miR-16 (targeting notably Bcl-2 and Mcl-1) in CLL
was the first event of this type to be discovered [33]. In
contrast, the antisense oligonucleotide strategy (targeting
mRNA for degradation) has already been tested in the
clinic with oblimersen (the most extensively tested Bcl-2
antisense oligonucleotide). Unfortunately, oblimersen has
only moderate therapeutic activity in CLL patients even
when combined with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide

Homoharringtonine and silvestrol
Homoharringtonine (Figure 2) and silvestrol are
alkaloids isolated from Asian plants which were originally
described as translation inhibitors. Both compounds are
able to induce mitochondrial apoptosis in CLL cells by
downregulating Mcl-1 [27,28]. Indeed, translational
inhibition preferably targets labile proteins. However,
a very recent report indicates that inhibition of Mcl-1

cells

The ABT series

Protein kinase B (AKT)

The organic molecule ABT-737 (Figure 2) targets
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w (but not Mcl-1 or A1) and, for
a time, was considered to be the sole bona fide BH3
mimetic [37]. Initially found to decrease the viability of
CLL cells [37], ABT-737 was demonstrated to induce
apoptosis through activation of the mitochondrial
pathway [41]. Clinical trials have been developed with
the orally available version ABT-263 (navitoclax): the
recent published Phase I data are promising, with a
partial response rate of 35% in relapsed or refractory CLL
patients [42]. To avoid the dose-limiting thrombocytopenia
associated with ABT-263 (due to inhibition of Bcl-xL
activity), the ABT-199 derivative was designed to bind
specifically to Bcl-2. This BH3 mimetic was found to
reduce the tumor burden in the first three CLL patients
recruited into an ongoing clinical trial [43].

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)

Obatoclax

Other signaling pathways

Obatoclax (GX15-070) is a synthetic derivative
of natural prodigiosins (Figure 2). It can bind to all
prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins albeit with low affinity [44].
This putative pan-BH3 mimetic, whose apoptotic activity
has been attributed to various mechanisms (including
Noxa induction and inhibition of AKT/mTOR pathway),
was found to induce mitochondrial apoptosis in CLL
patients’ cells [45]. Recent data indicate that obatoclax
can directly activate Bax (one of the two executioner
molecules in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization)
[46]. However, it is not known whether this activity occurs
in CLL cells. In Phase I clinical trials, obatoclax have
failed to demonstrate significant single agent efficacy in
CLL. Ongoing Phase II studies will determine whether
obatoclax might be active when combined with other
drugs [47].

and so attempts to overcome the latter have been proposed
recently [35].

2.2. Inhibitors of the functional activity of
prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins
The BH3 mimetic concept prompts the development
of small molecules capable of mimicking the BH3only proteins which are natural, direct antagonists of
the prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins. These small molecules
are designed to bind to the prosurvival proteins (with
the same high affinity as the natural ligands), inhibit
the antiapoptotic activity of the latter (by releasing the
sequestered proapoptotic Bax and Bak) and thus induce
apoptosis [36]. The generated BH3 mimetics are either
short peptides modeled on BH3 domains or small organic
molecules (identified by screening natural product
libraries or in silico-designed compounds for their ability
to bind Bcl-2 proteins). However, many compounds thus
identified did not fully meet the two main criteria defining
an authentic BH3 mimetic, i.e. (i) high-affinity binding to
the targets and (ii) induction of Bax and Bak-dependent
apoptosis [36]. Indeed, these putative BH3 mimetics
were found to act at least partly through off-target effects,
such as the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
endoplasmic reticulum stress, induction of the BH3-only

The gossypol family
Gossypol is a natural, polyphenolic aldehyde derived
from cotton seed (Figure 2) that was already known for its
proapoptotic activity prior to the discovery of its putative
BH3 mimetic property [48]. Gossypol acts at least partly
through off-target mechanisms such as ROS generation,
Noxa induction, autophagic cell death [38,39,49,50]. It has
been shown that gossypol induces mitochondrial apoptosis
in CLL cells [51]. The isomer AT-101 proved to be even
more active and capable of overcoming stroma-mediated
Mcl-1 induction and apoptosis prevention [52]. Phase I/
II trials of AT-101 in CLL have indicated only limited
single-agent therapeutic efficacy [36,53]. Several gossypol
derivatives (acting predominantly through BH3 mimicry)
are currently in preclinical studies [48]; these include
apogossypolone (ApoG2) which was recently reported to
induce apoptosis in CLL cells [54].

reported that some HDACi act through transcriptional
upregulation of Noxa and Bim mRNA [58]. Clinical data
on HDACi in CLL were disappointing: depsipeptide and
MGCD0103 have shown strong adverse effects and/or
limited therapeutic benefit for patients [60,61]. This may
be related to the fact that HDACi upregulate not only
proapoptotic proteins but also Mcl-1 (mRNA and protein)
in CLL cells [62]. Combinations with other drugs are
currently under clinical evaluation.

The peptide 072RB derived from the BH3 domain
of Bim is another putative pan-BH3 mimetic that can
induce CLL cell apoptosis and this effect is associated
with Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 downregulation [55].

2.3. Upregulators of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
Histone deacetylase inhibitors

Proteasome inhibitors

Histone deacetylation is an epigenetic mechanism
for transcriptional repression. Histone deacetylases
(HDAC) are overexpressed in many cancers including
CLL, in which they mediate epigenetic silencing of miR15a, miR-16 and miR-29b [56]. A number of natural and
synthetic HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) such as depsipeptide,
vorinostat, LBH589, and MGCD0103 (see Figure 2) can
promote different types of cell death in CLL cells notably
extrinsic death receptor and intrinsic mitochondrial
apoptosis [57-59]. Although ROS generation has
been implicated in HDACi-induced apoptosis, it was

The proteasome complex catalyses the degradation
of proteins targeted by ubiquitin and represents the major
regulatory pathway in protein turnover [63]. Various
classes of chemically distinct proteasome inhibitors
have been characterized. They include both synthetic
compounds such as the prototype bortezomib (Figure 2)
and natural products such as lactacystin and epoxomicin.
These compounds are found to affect key regulatory
cellular processes and have antitumor functions by
inducing apoptosis. Proteasome inhibitors enhance the
stability of many proteins and cause their accumulation.

Bcl-2 family members. In the former mechanism, several types of compounds downregulate the expression of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins
whereas BH3 mimetics inhibit their activity (via sequestration of Bax and Bak, the executioner molecules in the mitochondrial membrane
permeabilization). In the latter mechanism, apoptosis inducers upregulate the expression of BH3-only proteins (the endogenous antagonistic
ligands for prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, some of which are able to activate Bax and Bak directly). Inhibition of antiapoptotic factors and
stimulation of proapoptotic proteins can also be achieved indirectly by some compounds including multi-targets apoptosis inducers, which
are capable of interfering with various signaling pathways (e.g., NF-kB, PI3K/AKT, p53). Inhibition of other antiapoptotic proteins such
as IAP (antagonizinz caspase activity) is not sufficient to trigger apoptosis but does amplify the effects of certain apoptosis inducers.

It is well established that two targets are IkBalpha (the
physiologic inhibitor of NF-kB, which governs the
induction of a number of antiapoptotic proteins) and the
tumor suppressor p53 (which is known to activate the
transcription of proapoptotic proteins). Two other targets,
the BH3-only proteins Bim and Noxa, are increasingly
thought to be crucial for the proteasome inhibitors’
proapoptotic mechanisms of action [64].
More than a decade ago, the proteasome inhibitors
lactacystin and MG-132 were found to be potent inducers
of caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis in CLL
cells [65]. Bortezomib (which has been approved for
the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell
lymphoma) also induces apoptosis in CLL cells by
enhancing the stability and eliciting the accumulation of
the BH3-only protein Noxa [66]. However, a clinical trial
of bortezomib in CLL evidenced several toxic side-effects
and failed to produce objective responses [67]. These
disappointing results may well be related to the fact that
bortezomib and other proteasome inhibitors (e.g. MG132 and epoxomicin) also induce Mcl-1 accumulation
notably in CLL cells: this would decrease the proteasome
inhibitors’ apoptotic response and thus therapeutic efficacy
[68]. Interestingly, carfilzomib (a second-generation
proteasome inhibitor) shows activity in CLL cells through
an atypical mechanism, which has prompted the initiation
of a Phase I clinical study [69]. However, carfilzomib
also promotes Mcl-1 upregulation [70]. Combinations of
certain proteasome inhibitors with other drugs are tested
in ongoing clinical trials.

through upregulation of the BH3-only protein Noxa,
possibly via inhibition of proteasomal activity [78,79].
Interestingly, hyperforin-induced Noxa upregulation
occurs without change in Mcl-1 expression [79].
Drugs that upregulate BH3-only proteins in CLL
Although DNA-damaging chemotherapy is thought
to kill tumor cells mainly through the p53 pathway, the
mechanisms involved have still not been unambiguously
defined. A recent study demonstrated that the anticancer
effect of cyclophosphamide in a transgenic mouse model
of lymphoma requires not only the BH3-only proteins
Puma and Noxa (which are p53 targets) but also the p53independent Bim [80]. Whereas Puma strictly depends
on p53, Noxa can also be regulated independently of
p53. Many drugs used to treat CLL patients can trigger
apoptosis in vitro; interestingly, this effect is associated
with induction of at least one of the three proapoptotic
BH3-only proteins mentioned above. Fludarabine can
induce upregulation of Puma mRNA expression [81],
and glucocorticoids trigger caspase-dependent apoptosis
by increasing Bim mRNA levels [82]. Cisplatinium acts
by Noxa upregulation as a result of ROS generation
[83]. The purine nucleoside AICA-riboside (also called
acadesine, see Figure 2) induces mitochondrial apoptosis
of CLL cells via p53-independent increases in Noxa and
Bim mRNA levels [84]. Acadesine is currently being
evaluated in a Phase I/II trial in CLL. The purine analog
and alkylating agent bendamustine (Figure 2) activates the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by upregulating Puma
and Noxa. Unlike Puma, the Noxa upregulation seems to
result from ROS generation; bendamustine also induces
caspase-independent cell death [85].

Plant-derived proteasome inhibitors
A variety of compounds present in fruits, vegetables
and other plants can inhibit proteasome activities [63,71].
They include polyphenols such as resveratrol and
curcumin, flavonoids (also belonging to the wide class of
polyphenols) such as the flavone apigenin, the flavonol
quercetin and the catechin epigallocatechin gallate
(EGCG) as well as alkaloids of the terpenoid family such
as the triterpen celastrol [72]. All these natural proteasome
inhibitors display proapoptotic properties [71-73]. It is
noteworthy that resveratrol, curcumin, apigenin, quercetin
and EGCG induce CLL cell apoptosis (see below) as does
the synthetic diaminomethoxyflavone [74] that we have
recently shown to be a proteasome inhibitor [75]. It is
therefore possible that these compounds activate CLL
cell apoptosis at least partly through the inhibition of
proteasomal degradation.

Other CLL cell apoptosis inducers upregulating BH3only proteins
Aspirin was originally found to induce caspasedependent apoptosis in CLL cells and this effect was
recently associated with Noxa upregulation [86]. The
synthetic phenylacetylenesulfonamide (PAS, also
refered to as pifithrin-mu) exerts similar effects via a
p53-independent increase in Noxa mRNA levels [87].
Another CLL cell apoptosis inducer, forodesine (a purine
nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitor), can modulate a
number of apoptosis proteins and stimulate Bim protein
expression [88]. A pharmacodynamic study of oral
forodesine has shown its biological activity in CLL
patients [89].

Hyperforin

2.4. Other natural CLL cell apoptosis inducers

Hyperforin is a phloroglucinol purified from the
plant St John’s wort (Figure 2). It has multiple biological
properties, including in vitro and in vivo antitumor
effects which are associated in some cases with apoptosis
induction [76]. We were the first to show that hyperforin
triggers caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis in
primary CLL cells [77]. This natural phloroglucinol acts

Resveratrol, other grape-derived polyphenols and
derivatives
Trans-resveratrol is a phytoalexin from the stilbene
family of polyphenols (Figure 2) which is present in
316

Oncotarget

numerous plants, fruits and vine products. This compound
was already known to protect against cardiovascular
diseases. Extensive in vitro studies have revealed that
resveratrol also displays potential anticancer properties.
The polyphenol regulates many different molecular
targets and signaling pathways [90]. These include p53,
AP-1, members of the IAP and Bcl-2 families (such
as Puma, Bim and Noxa), proteasome activity, ROS
production, NF-kB, PI3K/AKT, MAP kinase, TRAILdeath receptor and mitochondrial pathways. Resveratrol
therefore displays the hallmarks of a multi-target apoptosis
inducer. We were the first to report that resveratrol induces
apoptosis in primary CLL cells, triggers the mitochondrial
pathway and activates caspase-3 [91]. Similar effects
have been observed with other wine-derived polyphenols
(vineatrols) and an acetate derivative of epsilon-viniferin
(a resveratrol dimer) [74,92]

pathways [98], the compound may act through several
mechanisms in CLL cells. As mentioned above,
diaminomethoxyflavone is an apoptosis inducer in CLL
cells [74] and this synthetic flavone can also inhibit the
PI3K/AKT pathway and proteasome activity [75].
Xanthohumol
This plant-derived, prenylated flavonoid is able
to induce CLL cell death through caspase-dependent
apoptosis resulting from activation of endoplasmic
reticulum stress [99]. In the same study, xanthohumol
was found to inhibit both proteasome activity and Mcl1 expression and these effects were associated with
inhibition of the translation initiator factor eIF2alpha
but not the modulation of NF-kB activation. Hence,
xanthohumol appears to be a natural proteasome inhibitor
capable of downregulating Mcl-1 in CLL cells.

Curcumin

Triterpenoids

Curcumin (an active component of turmeric) is
another well-known polyphenol with a broad range of
biological properties, including the ability to induce
apoptosis in CLL cells [93]. Although it was originally
suggested that curcumin acts through NF-kB inhibition,
the polyphenol also inhibits proteasome activity, AKT and
other signaling pathways (e.g. STAT3), downregulates
Mcl-1 and XIAP and upregulates Bim [93].

Natural and synthetic triterpenoids are potential
antitumor compounds possessing multifunctional
properties including antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, antiinflammatory and proapoptotic activities. The synthetic
triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28oic acid
(CDDO, see Figure 2) was shown to elicit apoptosis via
the mitochondrial pathway in CLL cells [100] and exert
antileukemic effects in a transgenic mouse model of CLL
[101]. Unlike the natural triterpen celastrol, CDDO is
not a proteasome inhibitor but reportedly acts through
various mechanisms, including inhibition of the NF-kB
pathway, endoplasmic reticulum stress, death receptor and
mitochondrial pathways.

Epigallocatechin gallate
This catechin (or flavanol) is the most active
flavonoid in green tea (Figure 2). Epigallocatechin gallate
(EGCG) has pleiotropic effects. It can notably trigger
caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis in many
tumor models, including primary CLL cells in which it
downregulates Mcl-1 and XIAP [94]. Several other crucial
apoptotic pathways such as proteasome inhibition are
involved in EGCG’s mechanisms of action [73]. A Phase
II study of EGCG in CLL has shown promising results
with reduction in lymphocytosis and/or adenopathy in 29
out of 42 patients (69%) [95].

Xanthones
Xanthones were originally isolated from the tropical
fruit mangosteen. They are known to possess a wide
spectrum of pharmacological properties and anticancer
effects. The compounds do modulate various targets and
signaling pathways (including apoptosis pathways) [102].
We have shown for the first time that several xanthones
purified from African trees (e.g. allanxanthone C, shown in
Figure 2) can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in CLL
cells via activation of the mitochondrial pathway or other
mechanisms [103]. We further reported that allanxanthone
C and macluraxanthone have in vivo therapeutic effects in
a xenograft murine model of CLL [104].

Quercetin
Like EGCG, this tea-derived flavonol (Figure
2) is a multi-target apoptosis inducer and proteasome
inhibitor [71]. Quercetin can trigger both the extrinsic and
intrinsic pathways in primary CLL cells, notably by Mcl-1
downregulation; the mechanism involves inhibition of the
PI3K/AKT pathway, which in turn leads to the instability
Mcl-1 mRNA and protein [96,97].

Arylcoumarin analogs of combretastatins
Combretastatins are natural stilbenoid polyphenols
isolated from African trees. They have antimitotic
properties by binding to tubulin, inhibiting its
polymerization and thus blocking microtubule assembly.
It was reported that the mitotic catastrophe triggered
by some combretastatins in human leukemia cells is
associated with caspase-dependent apoptosis [105].
We have shown that arylcoumarin derivatives, analogs
of combretastatin-A4 (that were synthesized to avoid

[110].

3. COMMENTS AND DISCUSSION

Vinblastine
The mitotic spindle poison vinblastine was the
first vinca alkaloid used in the treatment of CLL. It was
recently shown that vinblastine induces acute apoptosis in
CLL cells (independently of cell cycle) and that this effect
is associated with an increase in Noxa transcripts [107].
Other microtubule-disrupting agents (combretastatin-A4,
vincristine and vinorelbine) have the same effects [107].

3.1. The structural and functional diversity of
CLL cell apoptosis inducers
Inducers of CLL cell apoptosis display broad
functional diversity (Table 1). The class encompasses
inhibitors of transcription (CDK inhibitors), translation,
proteasome activity (affecting protein turnover), HDACs
(affecting epigenetic regulation), various kinases (affecting
different signaling pathways) and the antiapoptotic activity
of Bcl-2 proteins (BH3 mimetics). They also include
transcription modulators, cytokines, corticoids and various
types of cancer drugs (nucleotide analogs, alkylating
agents and microtubule-disrupting agents).
Apoptosis inducers also display structural diversity
(Table 2). Many are natural compounds (generally
derived from plants) or their semisynthetic/synthetic
derivatives. This group includes some of the most active
compounds such as the prototypic flavopiridol. Although
many plant-derived apoptosis inducers are flavonoids
(flavones, EGCG, quercetin, xanthohumol) or other
types of polyphenols (gossypol, resveratrol, curcumin),
other families are also represented, such as xanthones,
phloroglucinols (hyperforin) and various alkaloids
(homoharringtonine, silvestrol). Some apoptosis inducers
are derived from bacteria (depsipetide, lactacystin).
Furthermore, certain cancer drugs (vinblastine for
example) are themselves of natural origin. There are
also many synthetic apoptosis inducers including BH3
mimetics (the ABT series), triterpens (CDDO), various
enzyme inhibitors (proteasome, HDACs, kinases and
survival pathways), antisense oligonucleotides and
cytostatic drugs.

2.5. Other types of CLL apoptosis inducers
Fenretinide
The synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)
retinamide (called fenretinide) promotes the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway in CLL cells via ROS generation. This
is accompanied by Mcl-1 protein degradation resulting
from jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation [108]. Two
other mechanisms have been suggested: inactivation of
NF-kB and upregulation of Noxa (which is known to
target Mcl-1 for proteasomal degradation).
IAP antagonists
Two strategies to antagonize caspase inhibitors of
the IAP family have been developed [109]. Firstly, small
molecules mimicking Smac (the physiological antagonist
of IAP proteins) were designed: a Smac mimetic
antagonizing XIAP was found to enhance TRAIL-induced
CLL cell apoptosis [10]. Secondly, the antisense strategy
has been tested in a clinical trial of an XIAP antisense
oligonucleotide (AEG35156) in CLL, but the results were
not encouraging.
Inhibitors of various kinases and signaling pathways
A number of agents are currently tested in clinical
trials on the basis of their ability to indirectly induce
CLL cell apoptosis [5,8,16]. This is the case for CAL101 (PI3K inhibitor), Akti-1/2 and A-443654 (AKT
inhibitors), BAY117082 (NF-kB inhibitor), inhibitors of
kinases involved in BCR signaling such as dasatinib (Lyn
kinase) or fostamatinib (Syk) and other kinase inhibitors
such as sorafenib (multikinase) or imatinib (c-Abl kinase).
Furthermore, activated heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is
a chaperone molecule for the zeta-associated protein
ZAP-70 which positively regulates BCR signaling and
is expressed by CLL cells from patients with aggressive
disease. Inhibitors of Hsp90 (e.g. 17-DMAG) induce ZAP70 degradation and apoptosis of CLL cells and are tested
in ongoing clinical trials in CLL.

3.2. The mechanisms of action of apoptosis
inducers
As appears from the data, apoptosis inducers act
via two major mechanisms: (i) inhibition of either the
expression or activity of antiapoptotic proteins and
(ii) upregulation of proapoptotic molecules (Figure 3).
The targets are mostly Bcl-2 family proteins; this may
involve either downregulation of the family’s prosurvival
members (mainly Bcl-2 and Mcl-1), which are crucial
players in the impaired apoptosis in CLL, or upregulation
the BH3-only proteins (Bim, Puma, Noxa), which are
functional antagonists of the prosurvival members. These
data have therefore validated the Bcl-2 family proteins to
be crucial targets for novel therapeutic strategies, which
prompted the development of BH3 mimetics. Regarding
the inhibition of IAP family proteins, it seems to require

Interleukin-21 (IL-21)

death through upregulation of the BH3-only protein Bim

Oncotarget

TRAIL-activation of the death receptor pathway for the
full induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis inducers can also
act indirectly through either inactivation of NF-kB or
PI3K/AKT survival pathways (which are responsible for
transcriptional activation of Bcl-2 and IAP proteins) or
stimulation of the proapoptotic p53 pathway (resulting
in induction of BH3-only proteins). Lastly, some multitarget apoptosis inducers (such as resveratrol, curcumin,
flavonoids, xanthones, hyperforin and triterpens) are
capable of acting through several of these pathways (NFkB, PI3K/AKT and p53). Most of these compounds are
natural proteasome inhibitors.
The fact that many apoptosis inducers directly
target Bcl-2 family proteins constitutes a theoretical
advantage over chemotherapeutic agents, since these
proteins regulate the initial molecular events responsible
for triggering the caspase-dependent mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway. Indeed, apoptosis inducers have
mostly been found to trigger mitochondrial membrane
permeabilization, cytochrome c release and the caspase
cascade. Nevertheless, apoptosis inducers can also use
other mechanisms: caspase activation can result from
endoplasmic reticulum stress, ROS generation or the death
receptor pathway, and some compounds can even trigger
caspase-independent apoptosis or autophagic cell death
(Table 3).

its marked therapeutic effects in a transgenic mouse model
of CLL.
Only a few natural apoptotic inducers have
been clinically evaluated in CLL. Some plant-derived
compounds deserve to be tested in the clinic such as
hyperforin. Indeed, the latter advantageously upregulates
expression of the proapoptotic protein Noxa but not that
of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 (as compared to bortezomib
and HDAC inhibitors which upregulate both of these
proteins). Several improved derivatives of hyperforin
such as aristoforin have shown innocuousness and
efficacy in animal models [76]. Allanxanthone B and
macluraxanthone also appear to have therapeutic potential
since they were found to exhibit antileukemic effects in a
xenograft mouse model of CLL [104]. Lastly, it would be
interesting to evaluate natural flavonoids such as apigenin
(which inhibits both the proteasome and CDKs) and other
plant-derived proteasome inhibitors also capable of Mcl-1
downregulation (e.g. quercetin).
However, the main concern with natural apoptosis
inducers is that they often affect multiple molecular targets
and signaling pathways; this is the case for resveratrol,
curcumin, xanthones and hyperforin, for instance. It
is therefore difficult to determine which mechanism is
responsible for the proapoptotic effects. Moreover, this
pleiotropy may result in adverse drug reaction especially
during dose escalation. It is noteworthy that this
shortcoming also applies to synthetic apoptosis inducers
that are not specific for a unique molecular target (e.g.
CDK, proteasome and HDAC inhibitors). Likewise, a
survival pathway inhibitor usually affects several other
signaling pathways. This is even a problem with BH3
mimetics: (i) most putative mimetics act through offtarget effects and (ii) the bona fide BH3 mimetic ABT263 antagonizes both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, so that inhibition
of Bcl-xL activity results in toxic thrombocytopenia
in patients. In contrast, the newly developed ABT-199
antagonizes Bcl-2 but not Bcl-xL. All these data support
the rational use of apoptosis inducers in combination
therapy protocols. Furthermore, it is not surprising that
BH3 mimetics such as ABT-737/263 and Bcl-2 antagonists
in general also have antiangiogenic properties [111] since
Bcl-2 is known to have proangiogenic activities. This
may be of value inasmuch as (i) CLL cells constitutively
secrete the angiogenic factors VEGF and bFGF and
(ii) neo-angiogenesis is an important problem in CLL.
Nevertheless, the characterization of apoptosis inducers
and their mechanisms of action have enabled the
identification of specific molecular targets with potential
therapeutic interest as discussed below.

3.3. On the clinical use of apoptotic inducers in
CLL
The most encouraging clinical data have been
obtained with flavopiridol (the semisynthetic CDK
inhibitor that decreases Mcl-1 transcription) and ABT263 (the BH3 mimetic that antagonizes the activity of
prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins). Promising results were also
observed recently with the natural flavonoid EGCG,
which inhibits both the proteasome and Mcl-1 expression.
Extensive ongoing trials are assessing other CDK
inhibitors (SNS-032, dinaciclib), other BH3 mimetics
(the new ABT-199, gossypol derivatives), translation
inhibitors (homoharringtonine), sorafenib and other
kinase inhibitors, bendamustine, forodesine, acadesine and
Hsp90 inhibitors. Some synthetic apoptosis inducers with
high potency in vitro have turned out to be disappointing
when used to treat CLL patients: this is the case of the
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, several HDAC inhibitors
(MGCD0103 for instance) and antisense oligonucleotides
(targeting Bcl-2 or XIAP). Likewise, the BH3 mimetics
obatoclax and AT-101 have not shown therapeutic benefits
in CLL. Apoptosis inducers might be more successful in
the clinic when rationally combined with conventional
chemo-immunotherapy. Hence, flavopiridol, obatoclax,
proteasome inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors are currently
being tested in combination with other drugs. The triterpen
CDDO has not yet been evaluated in CLL patients despite

3.4. The Noxa/Mcl-1 axis as a critical drug target
for apoptosis-based strategies

(induced by ROS generation, for instance) can lead to
proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1; this mechanism has
been described for the retinoid derivative fenretinide.
Some flavonoids show a structural resemblance to
gossypol (see Figure 2) which is thought to function as
a BH3 mimetic. It would therefore be useful to establish
whether natural apoptosis inducers other than gossypol are
capable of BH3 mimicry. In such a case, their chemical
structures might serve as a framework for designing new
BH3 mimetics.
The development of BH3 mimetics capable of
mimicking Noxa and specifically antagonizing Mcl-1 has
also been considered. Proof of concept for Noxa-like BH3
mimetics has been provided by the characterization of two
compounds: a variant of the BH3 domain of Bim (called
BimS2A) and a stabilized alpha-helix of Bcl-2 domains
(SAHB) derived from the BH3 region of Mcl-1 itself
(called Mcl-1 SAHB) [50]. Furthermore, a prototypical
Mcl-1-specific BH3 mimetic (MIM 1) has recently been
identified [118]. This small molecule displaces Mcl1 SAHB from its binding partner Mcl-1 and induces
apoptosis through Bax/Bak activation in Mcl-1-dependent
leukemia cells. Moreover, the first pan-BH3 mimetic has
been discovered: it is a SAHB modeled on the Bim BH3
domain (called Bim SAHB) that (i) targets a broad range
of survival Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1 and A1),
(ii) induces caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis in
leukemia/lymphoma cells that are resistant to ABT-737
and (iii) suppresses tumor growth in a mouse model of
acute myeloid leukemia [119]. Lastly, the BH3 mimetic
concept has been used to design a compound capable
of mimicking an “activator” BH3-only protein and this
compound has led to the characterization of the direct Bax
activator molecule BAM7 [120]. It remains to be seen
whether the new BH3 mimetics MIM 1, Bim SAHB and
BAM7 are capable of inducing apoptosis in primary CLL
cells.

A number of apoptosis inducers that upregulate
Noxa in CLL cells have been mentioned above:
bortezomib and other proteasome inhibitors, several
HDAC inhibitors, hyperforin, acadesine, bendamustine,
cisplatinium, vinblastine and other vinca alkaloids, PAS
and aspirin. Noxa upregulation was also found to be
associated with apoptosis elicited by some agents whose
proapoptotic effects on CLL cells have been described
elsewhere (e.g. obatoclax, gossypol and derivatives and
resveratrol). Furthermore, several compounds known
for their proapoptotic activities on tumor cells other
than CLL are capable of activating Noxa: this is the
case for tetramethoxystilbene (a resveratrol analog),
isoliquiritigenin (a plant-derived flavonoid), phenoxodiol
(a semisynthetic isoflavone) as well as celastrol (a triterpen
proteasome inhibitor) [112-115]. Lastly, it must be borne
in mind that Noxa can be upregulated by the inhibition of
proteasomal activities and that some flavonoids capable
of inducing apoptosis in CLL cells have also been
characterized as natural proteasome inhibitors (EGCG,
quercetin, apigenin). Given that Noxa can bind to Mcl-1
but not other survival Bcl-2 proteins and that Mcl-1 clearly
has a critical antiapoptotic role, the Noxa/Mcl-1 axis is
an attractive target for apoptosis-based strategies in CLL
[116,117].

3.5. Novel developments in apoptosis-targeted
anti-CLL therapies
A number of reports have suggested combining
flavopiridol or other Mcl-1 downregulators with
proteasome or HDAC inhibitors (both of which enhance
Noxa and Mcl-1 expression) or ABT-263 (which
does not antagonize Mcl-1). It is noteworthy that
several flavonoids both downregulates Mcl-1 through
various different mechanisms (inhibition of CDKs and
transcription, translation and the PI3K/AKT pathway, for
example) and inhibits the proteasome in CLL cells: these
include xanthohumol, apigenin, EGCG and quercetin.
Diaminomethoxyflavone is also an apoptosis inducer in
CLL cells that can inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway and
proteasome activity. Since proteasome inhibition is known
to result in the stabilization and accumulation of the BH3only protein Noxa, it would be particularly interesting
to determine whether some of the natural proteasome
inhibitors can effectively enhance Noxa expression in
CLL cells. Their chemical structure might then serve as
a framework for the design of more efficient derivatives.
Likewise, other polyphenols that are multi-target apoptosis
inducers in CLL cells (such as resveratrol) are already
known to enhance Noxa and inhibit Mcl-1 (notably
through NF-kB inhibition). Moreover, Noxa expression

4. CONCLUSIONS
Attempts to reactivate the apoptotic machinery in
CLL cells in vitro have not yet led to the discovery of
novel therapeutics capable of curing CLL. However, a
number of the identified apoptosis inducers might be used
to improve the treatment of CLL patients via combination
with conventional chemo-immunotherapy. Moreover,
some natural apoptosis inducers deserve to be tested in
the clinic. Others might constitute the framework for
designing more efficient derivatives. The major drawback
of most apoptosis inducers is that they do not have specific
molecular targets. Nevertheless, the characterization of the
inducers’ mechanisms of action has validated the Bcl-2
family members and the Mcl-1/Noxa axis in particular as
potential therapeutic targets in CLL. The BH3 mimetic
concept is a potent weapon for circumventing the poor
specificity of many apoptosis inducers. The discovery
