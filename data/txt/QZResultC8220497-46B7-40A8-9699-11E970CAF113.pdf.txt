ABSTRACT
Survival of cancer cells relies on the unfolded protein response (UPR) to resist
stress triggered by the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). The IRE1a-XBP1 pathway, a key branch of the UPR, is activated in many
cancers. Here, we show that the expression of both mature and spliced forms of XBP1
(XBP1s) is up-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and AML patient
samples. IRE1a RNase inhibitors [MKC-3946, 2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (HNA),
STF-083010 and toyocamycin] blocked XBP1 mRNA splicing and exhibited cytotoxicity
against AML cells. IRE1a inhibition induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and G1
cell cycle arrest at least partially by regulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, G1 phase
controlling proteins (p21cip1, p27kip1 and cyclin D1), as well as chaperone proteins.
Xbp1 deleted murine bone marrow cells were resistant to growth inhibition by IRE1a
inhibitors. Combination of HNA with either bortezomib or AS2O3 was synergistic in AML
cytotoxicity associated with induction of p-JNK and reduction of p-PI3K and p-MAPK.
Inhibition of IRE1a RNase activity increased expression of many miRs in AML cells
including miR-34a. Inhibition of miR-34a conferred cellular resistance to HNA. Our
results strongly suggest that targeting IRE1a driven pro-survival pathways represent
an exciting therapeutic approach for the treatment of AML.

giving rise to a large population of immature leukemic
blasts [1–4]. LSCs are relatively insensitive to current
therapies [3]. Many AML cells initially respond to
treatment; however, relapse is often caused by LSCs
that are intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy [5–7].

INTRODUCTION
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive
hematological malignancy characterized by a small
population of self-renewing leukemic stem cells (LSCs)

The overall long-term survival of AML patients remains
extremely disappointing at approximately 30% to 50% [1,
8, 9]. Novel therapeutic approaches are clearly needed.
Hematopoietic cells, including LSCs, are exposed to
low levels of oxygen in the bone marrow, which may cause
accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), thereby stimulating ER stress and
activating the unfolded-protein-response (UPR) pathway [5,
6, 10–12]. ER stress and its UPR are properly compensated
in normal marrow hematopoietic cells [13, 14]. In contrast,
leukemic cells proliferating in a hostile environment of low
oxygen and limited nutrients accumulate misfolded proteins
in the ER, causing continuous ER stress with initiation of
UPR [15, 16]. Furthermore, leukemic cells produce mutant
proteins at a high rate resulting in misfolded proteins [17].
Sustained UPR initiates cellular defense mechanisms
rescuing leukemic cells from extreme cellular stress by
limiting de novo entry of proteins into the ER which in turn
enhances both protein folding capacity and degradation
activity [16]. The ability of leukemic cells to handle ER
stress may allow them to escape apoptosis and continue
their growth [16, 18].
Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (IRE1α) is
one of major ER transmembrane sensors that activates
the UPR [19]. IRE1α is evolutionarily conserved in
eukaryotes [19]. It has both Ser/Thr protein kinase,
as well as endoribonuclease (RNase) activities. Upon
activation, IRE1α initiates an unconventional removal of
a 26 base intron from the x-box binding protein 1 (XBP1)
mRNA, producing an active transcription factor (XBP1s).
XBP1s stimulates synthesis of several UPR target genes
including ER chaperones, Endoplasmic-ReticulumAssociated protein Degradation (ERAD) components
and transcription factors which function to relieve protein
misfolding [19, 20]. However, IRE1α acts as a doubleedged sword. If restoring ER homeostasis fails, IRE1α
represses adaptive responses and initiates apoptosis
through Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay (RIDD) of
a large list of substrates which may eventually induces
cell death[19, 20]. Caspase-2 (CASP2) is a pro-apoptotic
protease required to mediate cellular apoptosis [21]. Upregulation of CASP2 initiates the intrinsic pathway of
apoptosis. During RIDD, IRE1α cleaves and inactivates
anti-Casp2 pre-miRNAs (miR-17, miR-34a, miR-96, and
miR-125b) resulting in up-regulation of CASP2. Elevated
expression of CASP2 helps initiate apoptosis through
activating Bid, which causes release of mitochondrial
cytochrome c into the cytoplasm [22, 23]. TXNIP is
another direct target of miR-17 [24, 25]. TXNIP regulates
ER stress-related apoptosis. RIDD increases TXNIP
expression through decay of miR-17 [21–23].
The functions of the ER and its associated stress
pathways in AML have been studied including recent
studies that found approximately 25% of AML samples
had detectable XBP1s, indicating activation of UPR and
an increase of chaperone proteins [26, 27]. Many studies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have reported that perturbing the UPR with proteasome
inhibitors, such as bortezomib, can enhance apoptosis
of AML cells [28–32]. In this study, we explored
whether AML cells have activated IRE1α which can be
therapeutically targeted.

RESULTS
XBP1 and XBP1s are up-regulated in AML
IRE1 signaling pathway through XBP1 and
XBP1s is strongly linked with ER stress and UPR [33].
To examine if XBP1 has a crucial role in AML, we first
analyzed the AML methylation database (27k Illumina
methylation version) from TCGA. Compared with
normal samples, XBP1 was highly hypomethylated on
its CpG island in AML cases (Figure 1A). Consistent
with the methylation status, XBP1 expression was
significantly up-regulated in AML cases [5 previously
published microarray databases (Figure 1B) and our
QRT-PCR results (Figure 1C)]. A combination analysis
of the 5 published databases showed that XBP1 ranked
No. 679th of the most highly expressed genes in
AML (Figure 1B). Results were calculated by online
analysis engine Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.
org/resource/login.html). Interestingly, XBP1s was
detectable in 85% (22 of 26) of the leukemia cell lines
and 71% (17 of 24) of AML patient samples (Figures
1D, 1E). Normal purified CD34+ myeloid stem cells
did not have detectable XBP1s (Figure 1E). XBP1s
was also significantly elevated in AML samples from
patients compared to CD34+ normal myeloid stem cells
(p=0.0043, n=28) as measured by QRT-PCR (Figure 1F).
To investigate correlations between XBP1 expression
and AML clinical features, we first performed statistical
analysis to correlate the expression of XBP1/XBP1S
with French-American-British (FAB) subtypes in our
own dataset (Table S2 and Figure 1C, 1E, 1F). However,
probably due to the limited numbers of cases, we did
not observe a significant association between XBP1/
XBP1s and FAB subtypes among the 24 AML samples
(data not shown). We next performed similar statistical
analysis using TCGA AML dataset. Since XBP1s was not
discernable from total XBP1 in the dataset, we only tested
total XBP1 level. Interestingly, XBP1 expression was
significantly increased in FAB M3 subgroup compared
with M0, M1 and M2 but significantly decreased in M4M7 subgroup (Figure S1). The biological significance of
these correlations requires further investigations.

IRE1α RNase inhibitors blocked splicing of
XBP1 mRNA and exhibited cytotoxicity against
AML cells
Recently, a novel small-molecule RNase inhibitor
of IRE1 (MKC-3946) was noted to have potent anti18737

proliferative activity in multiple myeloma (MM) [34].
The compound was found to be very unstable in vitro;
however, one of the two major hydrolyzed precursors,
A-106 (2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde, HNA) retained the
IRE1α RNase inhibitory activity [35]. Tunicamycin (TM)
induces ER stress and XBP1 splicing in many cells [36].
Following TM treatment, increased expression of XBP1s
mRNA and decreased XBP1u (unspliced, transcriptional
inactive form of XBP1) were observed in 293T and
K562 myeloid leukemia cells (Figure S2A). Compared
with MKC-3946, HNA showed either the same or
more potent ability to inhibit the activity of IRE1α to
cleave XBP1 into the active XBP1s after TM induced
activation of NB4 cells (Figure S2B). STF-083010 is a
newly developed IRE1α endonuclease specific inhibitor
which has shown cytotoxic activity against human

multiple myeloma [37, 38]. Treatment of AML cells
with increasing drug dosage showed slightly enhanced
potency of HNA compared to STF-083010 (Figures
S3A-D). HNA dose-dependently inhibited XBP1s
expression induced by TM in AML cell lines and AML
patient samples (Figures 2A- 2C). HNA significantly
decreased cellular viability of both AML cell lines
(mean GI50=31 μM, n=8) and AML patient samples
(mean GI50=35 μM, n=18) compared to untreated patient
samples (mean GI50=154 μM, n=5, Figures 2C-2E).
Importantly, HNA caused a significant inhibition (mean
GI50=6 μM, n=6) of clonogenic growth in soft agar of
AML cells from patients (Figure 2F). In contrast, HNA
had very low toxicity against normal human marrow
mononuclear cells (mean GI50=123 μM, n=4) (Figure
2E). We conducted western blotting assay on BALL1,

protein levels were correlated with their mRNA levels.
Specifically, K562 cells showed expression of both
XBP1s mRNA and protein, whereas BALL1 and REH
cells expressed neither mRNA nor protein of XBP1s
(Figures 1D and S2D). Furthermore, we confirmed that
the ER stress inducer thapsigargin successively induced
XBP1s expression (Figure S2D).

several other chaperone genes Calnexin, HERPUD1,
DNAJC3, DNAJB9 and EDEM were significantly downregulated by HNA (Figure 3E). These results indicate that
IRE1α inhibition induced cell death by blockage of prosurvival UPR pathways and enhancement of pro-apoptotic
pathways.

(Figures 3A, S4), increased the percent of cells in G1 of
the cell cycle (Figure 3B), increased cleaved PARP and
caspase-3 (Figure 3C), down-regulated Bcl-2 pro-survival
family members (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl), up-regulated the
pro-apoptotic protein, Bim (Figures 3D, S5), increased
G1 phase regulators (p21cip1, p27kip1), and decreased level
of cyclin D1 (Figure 3D). Chaperone protein CHOP
is up-regulated by ER stress and enhances ER stress
induced apoptosis. However, other chaperone proteins
such as Calnexin, HERPUD1, DNAJC3, DNAJB9 and
EDEM are activated by UPR which is beneficial for cell
survival during ER stress [40, 41]. Our results showed
HNA treatment increased CHOP mRNA and protein (a
chaperone molecule) (Figures 3D, 3E, S5). In contrast,

Absence of Xbp1 in murine myeloid cells
produced resistance to Ire1α inhibitors
To assess whether Xbp1 is a major driver of Ire1α
signaling pathway, we generated a model based on bone
marrow progenitor cells from mice carrying a floxPflanked allele of Xbp1 (Xbp1flox/flox). After Cre activation,

more than 92% of Xbp1 was confirmed to be deleted in
the floxed cells as evidenced by QRT-PCR (Figure 4A).
Ire1α-Xbp1 in vivo inhibition effect was confirmed as
HNA decreased TM induced Xbp1s levels in bone marrow
cells of mice (Figure S6). Myeloid cells (94 % CD34+)
with deleted Xbp1 showed slower proliferation (Figure
4B) and increased resistance to both IRE1α inhibitors
(toyocamycin and HNA) (Figures 4C, 4D). Treatment
with TM (1 mg/ml) produced negligible cytotoxicity to
the murine BM cells (Figure S8B). Combination of TM (1
mg/ml) with HNA, increased cell viability in Xbp1-/- cells
compared to vector control cells (Figures 4E), suggesting
that Ire1α induced UPR is at least partially reliant on
Xbp1.

leukemia cells [47, 48]. Both drugs induced apoptosis
associated with p-JNK activation in cancer cells [49,
50]. We hypothesized that the combination of an IRE1α
RNase inhibitor with either bortezomib or AS2O3, will
enhance the inhibition of proliferation of AML cells.
Indeed, various concentrations of either drug combined
with HNA synergistically inhibited growth of both NB4
cells and an AML patient sample #19 (Figures 5A-5D).
Also, bortezomib induced expression of p-JNK, as well
as reduced levels of p-MAPK and p-PI3K in NB4 cells.
(Figure 5E).

Combination of HNA with either bortezomib or
AS2O3 synergistically inhibited growth of AML
cells

Recent studies discovered that IRE1α could cleave
4 anti-Casp2 pre-miRNAs (miR-17, -34a, -96, and -125b),
resulting in activation of CASP2 in mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) [22, 23]. To assess whether the
cleavage of miRs occurs in AML, we examined expression
levels of pre-miRs upon treatment of NB4 AML cells with
IRE1α inhibitors. The pre-miRs -17, -21, -34a, -147 and
-150 were dramatically increased after exposure of the
AML cells to IRE1α inhibitor (HNA, 25, 50 μM) in a

Bortezomib is a potent 26S proteasome inhibitor
which induces terminal UPR and apoptosis in many cells
[42–45]. AS2O3 is a leading therapy for treatment of acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APL) [46] and has recently
been shown to induce ER stress in cancer cells including

dose-dependent manner (Figures 6A, 6B). Also, U937, HL60, KG-1 and K562 cells responded to the IRE1 inhibitor
(HNA) by increasing the levels of miR-34a (Figure 6B).
Furthermore, other IRE1α inhibitors (STF-083010, 50 μM;
Toyocamycin, 500 nM) dramatically increased miR-34a
in AML cells (NB4, THP-1, K562, U-937, patients #27
and #28, Figure 6C). In contrast, exposure to TM (2.5
μg/ml, 12 h), a known IRE1 enhancer, slightly inhibited
levels of miR-34a and miR-96 even in the presence
of HNA (25 μM; 12 h) (Figure 6D). Actinomycin D, a
DNA transcription inhibitor inhibited HNA induced
miR-34a activation (Figure S7). In the presence of TM
(1-4 μg/ml; 72 h), murine myeloid cells with deletion of
Xbp1 (following Cre activation) had no change in either
the expression of miR -34a, -96, -147 and -150 (Figure
S8A) or in cell growth (Figure S8B). Murine BM cells
treated with HNA (25, 50 μM; 12 h) also displayed a dosedependent increase of pre-miRs which was independent of
Xbp1 (Figure S8C), suggesting that this regulation might
be directly through IRE1-driven RIDD.

miR-34a by the antagonist was validated both at the preand mature miR level by QRT-PCR (Figures 7A-7C, left
panels). Inhibition of miR-34a conferred modest survival
advantage compared to HNA alone in these AML cells
(Figures 7A-7C, right panels). In addition, HNA inhibited
transcriptional levels of several targeted genes of miR-34a
(c-Myc, cyclin D1, CDK4) in NB4 cells (Figure 7D); Also
in the AML cells, the miR-34a antagonist restored protein
expression levels of c-Myc and cyclin D1 proteins, these
had been inhibited in their expression in the presence of
HNA alone. (Figure 7E).

DISCUSSION
The UPR is a defense mechanism activated by cells
during stressful conditions in response to an accumulation
of misfolded proteins in the ER [51]. Cancer cells are
usually exposed to many stressful environments (e.g.
hypoxia, nutrient starvation, oxidative stress and other
metabolic dysregulation) resulting in continued ER
stress. Furthermore, genomic mutations can also lead to
accumulation of misfolded proteins. The UPR is often
activated to help cancer cells escape from ER stressinduced cell death [52]. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
in AML cells can also stimulate ER stress and the UPR
[11, 53, 54]. Studies have particularly focused on the
functional roles of UPR proteins in multiple myeloma
cells because chronic ER stress occurs in these cells

[37, 55, 56]. Activation of the unfolded protein response
including XBP1 splicing has been noted in AML samples
[26, 27]. In our study, we confirmed that one of the major
branches of the UPR (IRE1-XBP1s) is frequently activated
in AML cell lines and AML patient samples, suggesting
that targeting the UPR may be a promising adjunctive
approach for treatment of AML.
XBP1 and its spliced form XBP1s have been
reported to be upregulated in several types of cancers,
and blockage of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway is considered
as a promising therapeutic option [55, 57–61]. XBP1 is
one of the most well studied genes modulated by IRE1α,
which has important roles in the regulation of cell survival
and UPR as a downstream target of IRE1α [55, 62–65].
However, XBP1 is not the only factor in response to
IRE1α inhibition. In fact, as an RNase, IRE1α recognizes
and cleaves a consensus element, CUGCAG, in target
RNAs upon cellular stresses [66]. Therefore, IRE1α has
the capacity to target directly a number of RNAs (both
coding and noncoding) and regulate their expression levels
through Regulated IRE1-Dependent Decay (RIDD). For
example, in a recent study using MEF cells, IRE1α was
found to cleave four anti-CASP2 miRs (miR-17, -34, -96

and -125) [22, 23]. Based on our bioinformatic analysis
of miRs and RNA microarray results, we found that many
pre-miRs with IRE1α cutting consensus motif were upregulated upon HNA treatment. We focused on 5 of these
candidate miRs and QRT-PCR results demonstrated that
they were induced in the presence of IRE1α inhibitors
(Figure 6). Together, these results suggest that the antineoplastic effects of IRE1α inhibitors are the results of the
enhanced nuclease activity that generates not only XBP1s,
but also a number of other RNAs, including miRNAs.
We particularly focused on miR34a. Recent studies
indicate that miR-34a is a tumor suppressor [67]. Downregulation of miR-34a causes resistance to chemotherapy
[67–69]. Targets of miR-34a include caspase-2, c-Myc,
Bcl-2, cyclin D1, MET and SIRT1. miR-34a dependent
inhibition of SIRT1 can increase acetylation and activation
of p53 resulting in up-regulation of p21 and PUMA [70].
By post-transcriptional blockade of these genes, miR-34a
suppresses migration and induces apoptosis, G1 cycle arrest
and senescence in cancer cells [71, 72]. Our study showed
that IRE1α inhibitors significantly increased pre- and mature
miR-34a mRNA levels, associated with inhibition of CDK4,
c-Myc, Bcl-2 and Cyclin D1 and induction of p21cip1 and

p27kip1 in AML cells. Silencing of miR-34a by small RNA
antagonist significantly induced resistance of AML cells to
IRE1α inhibitors and restored levels of miR-34a targeted
oncogenes such as c-Myc and Cyclin D1. These results
indicate that miR-34a plays an important role in IRE1αdependent UPR in AML. Through cleavage of miR-34a,
IRE1α decreases miR-34a induced apoptosis and helps AML
cells to escape death.
Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor which has
been approved by FDA as the first example of UPRmodulating regimen for the treatment of Multiple
Myeloma [73]. Recently, bortezomib was also approved
for treatment of mantle cell lymphoma [74]. In the
context of AML, several clinical studies have shown
that bortezomib has potent anti-neoplastic activity, and
the mechanisms include induction of apoptosis and
transcriptional inactivation of several important AMLdrivers such as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)

and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) [29, 38, 75, 76].
Moreover, bortezomib has shown greater therapeutic
value when applied in combination with traditional
cytotoxic chemotherapies to treat AML [31, 77, 78].
Therefore, although not yet approved by FDA, bortezomib
has demonstrated its promising therapeutic merit and is
considered as one of the candidate drugs for the treatment
of AML. On the other hand, several studies have shown
that IRE1α inhibitors in combination with bortezomib
strongly impaired the growth of multiple myeloma
cells both in vitro and in vivo [37, 55]. Mechanistically,
IRE1α inhibition can overcome the tumor cytoprotective
effects conferred by bortezomib-induced UPR via
activation of XBP1s [55]. In the present study, we also
showed that combined addition of HNA with bortezomib
synergistically increased apoptosis of AML cells
associated with the up-regulation of CHOP and p-JNK.
Therefore, we believe that our results will provide useful

small RNA were transiently transfected and knock-down efficiencies of either pre-miR-34a or mature miR-34a were evaluated by QRTPCR in K562 (A, left side), NB4 (B, left side) and U937 (C, left side). At 24 h after transfection, cells (10,000) were seeded into 96-well
plates followed by treatment with HNA (0, 12.5, 25, 50 μM) for 72h, and cell viability was measured (MTT assay) (A-C, right side). D.
NB4 cells were treated with HNA (25 μM, 24 h) or diluent control. mRNA expression levels of pre-miR-34a, SRRT-1, LDNA, MTA2,
CCNE2, CDK4, CDK6, c-Myc and cyclin D1 were measured by QRT-PCR. Relative expression of each gene was normalized to GAPDH.
E. At 48 h after transfection of miR-34a antagonist or control siRNA, NB4 cells were treated with HNA (25 μM, 48 h) or diluent control,
and protein expressions of c-Myc, cyclin D1 and p21cip1 were evaluated by western blotting (β- actin as loading control). Data represent

information to the investigators who are interested in
developing bortezomib for the treatment of AML.
Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)
with AS2O3 has unique favorable cure rates [79], and the
major mechanism of action is through the degradation
of PML-RARα, the driver of APL [80]. Notably, AS2O3
has been reported to enhance UPR by increasing the
expression of GRP78, CHOP, phosphorylated eIF2α and
ATF4 [81, 82]. In our study, the combination of HNA
and AS2O3 synergistically increased cell apoptosis of
the APL cells NB4, which might be due to corroborative
inhibition of different branches of the UPR pathway. In the
previous clinical trials, QT interval prolongation and APL
differentiation syndrome are the most serious side-effects
of AS2O3 treatment [83]. The combined use of HNA and
AS2O3 may improve the toxicity profile.
In conclusion, we found that XBP1 and its spliced
form (XBP1s) are often increased in AML. Inhibition
of IRE1α RNase activity by small molecules inhibited
AML cell growth. This inhibition of proliferation
probably occurred by inducing ER stress by blocking
the compensatory pathways including the prevention
of cleavage of tumor suppressor miRs (e.g. miR-34a)
which may augment the anti-proliferative effect of IRE1α
inhibitors. Therefore, compounds which inhibit activation
of IRE1α represent a novel pathway for cell kill and may
be a useful compliment to chemotherapy.
