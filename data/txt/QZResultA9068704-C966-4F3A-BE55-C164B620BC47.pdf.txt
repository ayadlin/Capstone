Abstract
The Notch ligand delta-like 4 (Dll4) has been identiﬁed as a
promising target in tumor angiogenesis in preclinical studies, and
Dll4 inhibitors have recently entered clinical trials for solid
tumors, including ovarian cancers. In this study, we report the
development of REGN421 (enoticumab), a fully human IgG1
monoclonal antibody that binds human Dll4 with sub-nanomolar afﬁnity and inhibits Notch signaling. Administering REGN421
to immunodeﬁcient mice engineered to express human Dll4
inhibited the growth of several human tumor xenografts in
association with the formation of nonfunctional tumor blood
vessels. In ovarian tumor xenograft models, Dll4 was expressed
speciﬁcally by the tumor endothelium, and Dll4 blockade by
human-speciﬁc or mouse-speciﬁc Dll4 antibodies exerted potent

Introduction
The Notch pathway is an evolutionary conserved signaling
system that regulates cell fate speciﬁcation and tissue patterning
(1). In mammals, the Notch signaling system consists of ﬁve
canonical membrane-bound ligands, Dll (delta-like) 1, 3, 4, and
Jagged 1 and 2, and four single-pass transmembrane receptors,
Notch1-4. Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of Notch
triggers the proteolytic activation of the receptor and translocation
of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) to the nucleus, where it
interacts with CSL (CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, Lag-1) transcription factor to regulate the expression of Notch target genes (2).
Functional studies have demonstrated a critical role for Dll4Notch signaling during the formation of the vascular system
(3–5). Dll4-Notch signaling functions downstream of VEGF and
acts as a negative regulator of endothelial cell proliferation and
sprouting, in part by downregulating the expression of VEGF
receptors (6–12). In preclinical tumor models, blockade of
Dll4-Notch signaling results in the formation of hypersprouting,

antitumor activity, which relied entirely on targeting Dll4
expressed by tumor stromal cells but not by the tumor cells
themselves. However, Dll4 blockade reduced Notch signaling in
both blood vessels and tumor cells surrounding the blood vessels,
suggesting that endothelial-expressed Dll4 might induce Notch
signaling in adjacent ovarian tumor cells. The antitumor effects of
targeting Dll4 were augmented signiﬁcantly by simultaneous
inhibition of VEGF signaling, whereas this combined blockade
reversed normal organ vascular changes induced by Dll4 blockade
alone. Overall, our ﬁndings deepen the rationale for antibodybased strategies to target Dll4 in ovarian cancers, especially in
combination with VEGF blockade. Cancer Res; 75(19); 4086–96.

nonfunctional tumor vasculature, associated with the inhibition
of tumor growth (13–16).
Unlike g-secretase inhibitors that broadly block all Notch
signaling, speciﬁc pharmacologic targeting of Dll4 with anti-Dll4
antibodies does not induce overt gastrointestinal toxicity and has
thus emerged as an attractive target for antiangiogenic cancer
therapy (15, 17). Indeed, anti-Dll4 antibodies have recently
entered clinical trials for the treatment of advanced solid tumors,
including ovarian malignancies. In human tumors, Dll4 expression is typically restricted to the tumor vasculature, and low
to undetectable in the vasculature of adjacent normal tissue
(13, 18–22). In breast and ovarian cancer, Dll4 expression appears
correlated to clinical outcome (18, 23).
Angiogenesis plays an important role in ovarian physiology and
cancer biology, and the exploration of VEGF-targeting agents in this
disease has demonstrated clinical beneﬁt (24). However, not all
ovarian cancers are responsive to VEGF inhibitors (25), and initially
sensitive tumors eventually develop resistance to VEGF inhibitors
(26, 27). Thus, there is great clinical need to target additional
antiangiogenic pathways to increase clinical beneﬁt. Here, we examined the activity of a new potent and speciﬁc antibody inhibitor of
Dll4-Notch signaling, REGN421 (called enoticumab), in ovarian
xenograft models. We demonstrate potent antitumor activity of Dll4
blockade in ovarian tumor xenograft models that is dependent on
targeting stromal Dll4. In addition to the effect of REGN421 treatment on tumor angiogenesis, we identiﬁed spatially restricted,
paracrine Dll4-Notch signaling interactions, which may promote
ovarian tumor growth. The antitumor activity of Dll4 blockade in
ovarian tumors was markedly augmented by the simultaneous
targeting of VEGF signaling while normal organ vascular changes

Dll4 Blockade in Ovarian Tumors

induced by Dll4 blockade alone are reversed, thus suggesting
enhanced clinical beneﬁt for this combination approach.

Materials and Methods
Generation of antibodies
VelocImmune mice (with genes encoding human immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain variable regions) were
immunized with recombinant human Dll4 extracellular domain.
Spleens were harvested for generation of hybridomas or for direct
isolation of antigen-positive splenocytes. The cloned human
immunoglobulin variable region genes from antibodies exhibiting the desired characteristics were joined to human IgG1 constant region genes for production in chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cells. REGN421 was selected as a lead antibody from more than
300 antigen-positive clones, based on in vitro biochemical properties as well as the ability to inhibit tumor xenograft growth.
Research grade, function-blocking antibodies to murine Dll4
(REGN1035), human/mouse Notch1, and Notch3 were generated using VelociImmune technology.
Determination of REGN421 binding afﬁnity
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)–based BiaCore technology
was used to determine both on-rate and off-rate kinetic data to
calculate an equilibrium dissociation constant for each of the
antigen–antibody interactions. The binding speciﬁcity of
REGN421 for Dll4 was evaluated using BiaCore-based SPR technology. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was mathematically calculated from the dissociation rate constant (kd)
divided by the association rate constant (ka). REGN421 was
analyzed for binding to recombinant soluble monomeric forms
of human, monkey (Macaca fascicularis), and murine Dll4. In
addition, binding kinetics of REGN421 to dimeric Fc-fusions of
human and monkey Dll4 were also determined. The kinetic
parameters were obtained by globally ﬁtting the data to a 1:1
binding model using BiaEvaluation software 4.1.
Notch reporter assay
The ability of REGN421 to bind Dll4 was also evaluated in an
ELISA format. Serial dilutions of antibodies were bound to
microtiter plate–coated human Dll4 (fused with two myc epitope
tags and 6XHis) for 1 hour at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated a-hIgG polyclonal antibody and developed with tetramethylbenzidine and analyzed in Prism. The EC50 value was
calculated, deﬁned as the concentration of REGN421 required
to achieve 50% of Dll4 maximal binding signal. The ability of
REGN421 to block human Dll4 binding to Notch1 was tested in a
competition sandwich ELISA assay. Various concentrations of
REGN421 or isotype control antibody were mixed with 30
pmol/L biotinylated extracellular domain of human Dll4 fused
with the Fc portion of the human IgG1 protein and incubated for 1
hour at room temperature. The mixture was then transferred to a
microtiter plate coated with hNotch1 (fused with human Fc) to
capture the unbound Dll4 in the solutions. Plate-bound Dll4 was
detected with HRP-conjugated streptavidin and developed with
tetramethylbenzidine substrates. Data analysis was performed
with Graphpad Prism software using a sigmoidal dose–response
model, and IC50 values were determined (concentration of
REGN421 required to block 50% of Dll4 binding). To determine
the ability of REGN421 to neutralize Dll4-mediated cellular

functions in vitro, an HEK293 cell line expressing human Notch
1 was stably transfected with a CBF1-luciferase reporter plasmid
(28). Titration of the amount of coated Dll4 ligand established a
dose-dependent response curve of reporter activation. Based on
the observed dose response for plate-coated Dll4 ligand, the
bioassay plates were coated with Dll4 at a concentration of 1
nmol/L at 16 hours prior to addition of the HEK293 reporter cells
and REGN421. Cells were incubated at 37 C for 24 hours following which Dll4-mediated signaling was measured by quantitation of luciferase activity (shown in arbitrary units). A titration
of varying concentrations of REGN421 was used to establish an
inhibition curve, and an IC50 value of approximately 21 pmol/L
was observed for inhibition of Dll4-mediated signaling by
REGN421. TOV-112D cells were stably transduced with a RBPjluc Notch signaling reporter construct (Qiagen). TOV-112D/
RBPj-luc cells displayed luciferase expression in response to
immobilized Dll4. To quantify Notch signaling inhibition, a ﬁxed
amount of biotinylated Dll4 was coated onto the streptavidin
plate for 2 hours at room temperature, and monoclonal antibodies were preincubated with TOV112D/RBPj-luc cells for 1
hour before addition to the plates. After overnight incubation,
luciferase activity was measured using the substrate ONE-Glo
(Promega).
HUVEC ﬁbrin bead sprouting assay
To assess the effects of REGN421 on three-dimensional endothelial cell growth in vitro, ﬁbrin bead assay was performed (29).
Brieﬂy, Cytodex beads were coated with sub-conﬂuent human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cells (Lonza) and
embedded in ﬁbrin gel. Lung ﬁbroblasts were seeded on top of
the gel, and antibodies were added at 25 mg/mL. Fresh antibodies
were added with each EGM-2 medium change every 2 days. On
day 7, HUVEC sprouts were ﬁxed and processed as described (30).
Maximum intensity projections of transmitted light Z-stacks were
collected on Image Xpress Micro at 10. MetaXpress Journal was
used to quantitate the number of nuclei per bead (approximately
250 beads/well were analyzed). Branch points were quantitated
manually (15 beads per well were analyzed).
FACS analysis
To determine Notch receptor expression in ovarian xenograft
cell lines, cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 C for
30 minutes. Antibodies used were as follows: Notch1, Notch3
(generated at Regeneron), Notch2, and Notch4 (both Biolegend).
Generation of humanized Dll4 mice
Since REGN421 does not cross react with rodent Dll4, "humanized" mice were created in which the gene region encoding the
Dll4 extracellular domain was replaced with the analogous DNA
sequences encoding the human Dll4 extracellular domain via
homologous recombination in ES cells. Resultant humanized
Dll4 mice were phenotypically normal and fertile, indicating that
extracellular human Dll4 can bind to mouse Notch receptors and
functionally substitute for the mouse extracellular domain. For
additional validation, the effects of the Dll4 humanization on
thymus homeostasis were analyzed. Thymus size and gene expression proﬁles were essentially unchanged in humanized Dll4 mice
relative to wild-type mice, while anti-Dll4 antibody treatment
severely impaired thymic cellularity and T-cell differentiation
with concomitant substantial gene expression changes, thus

further demonstrating that the humanization of Dll4 promotes
normal Dll4-Notch signaling. The humanized Dll4 allele was
crossed onto the immunodeﬁcient SCID mouse strain to enable
xenograft tumor studies.
Tumor xenograft growth studies
Tumor cells obtained from the ATCC (the identities of our
human tumor cell lines were authenticated by short tandem
repeat proﬁling at the ATCC) were implanted subcutaneously
into the hind ﬂank of 8- to 12-week-old humanized Dll4 or wildtype C.B.-17 SCID mice (for Colo205, HT1080, TOV-112D,
SKOV-3, OVCAR-3, OV-90 tumors, 1  106 cells), or intraperitoneally (A2780, 2  106 cells). Once subcutaneous tumors were
established (100–200 mm3 in volume), mice were randomized
into treatment groups (n ¼ 5–8 mice per group) and injected
subcutaneously with human Fc control protein, REGN421,
REGN1035 (mouse Dll4-speciﬁc surrogate monoclonal antibody), or aﬂibercept at the indicated doses and treatment intervals. Fully effective doses of REGN421 and REGN1035 for onceweekly dosing were deﬁned as 2.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively. Tumor size (in mm3) was calculated from caliper measurements by using the formula for a spheroid approximation 4/3  p
[length (mm)/2]  [width (mm)/2]2, with width as the smaller
dimension. Average tumor growth for each treatment group was
compared using one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni multiple comparison test. For intraperitoneal A2780 tumor growth studies,
treatment was initiated 1 or 2 weeks after tumor cell implantation,
as indicated. In A2780 survival studies, demised animals found in
a cage or intraperitoneal tumor burden exceeding 5 grams were
deﬁned as events. All procedures were conducted according to the
guidelines of the Regeneron Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
PK modeling
The Michaelis–Menten model with parallel linear and nonlinear elimination was utilized to estimate pharmacokinetics of
REGN421 in mouse. There were 2 physiologic compartments
(injection site and central compartment) in the model. The
differential equations from the primary model are described
below:

where A1 is the amount of functional REGN421 at the injection
site, A2 is the amount of functional REGN421 in the central
compartment, ke is the elimination rate, V2/F is the apparent
volume of central compartment, ka is the ﬁrst-order absorption
rate constant, Vmax is the maximum rate of target-mediated
elimination, and Km is the Michaelis–Menten constant. NONMEM version 6 was used for modeling and simulation.
Immunohistochemical analysis
Parafﬁn-embedded, formalin-ﬁxed tumor sections were
stained with a rat anti-murine CD31 (BD Pharmingen) following
proteinase K-mediated antigen retrieval. Where applicable, sections were subsequently stained with Ki67 antibody (BD Pharmingen) to assess cellular proliferation. Notch1-ICD IHC staining

4088 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

was performed with cleaved Notch1-speciﬁc antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) as described (31), and samples were costained with anti-human vimentin antibody (Invitrogen) where
applicable. For immunoﬂuorescence (IF) staining, optimal cutting temperature (OCT)–embedded tumor sections were stained
with antibodies to CD31 (Millipore), PDGFRb (eBioscience), and
human vimentin (Invitrogen). Where applicable, tumor microvascular density was quantiﬁed using NIH ImageJ software. IF and
IHC staining for Dll4 expression was performed using a proprietary Regeneron Dll4 antibody. Notch1 expression in ovarian
xenograft tumors was analyzed with rabbit anti-Notch1 antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology). A2780 tumor perfusion was assessed
by transcardiac FITC-lectin perfusion (50 mg Isolectin B4; Vector
labs) followed by perfusion ﬁxation with 1% paraformaldehyde
and CD31IF staining of OCT-embedded tumor sections.

Results
Fully human monoclonal antibody, REGN421, binds human
Dll4 with high afﬁnity and inhibits endothelial Dll4-Notch
signaling
Human antibodies against Dll4 were generated as described in
Materials and Methods. The lead antibody REGN421 (selected
from more than 300 antigen-positive clones) exhibited highafﬁnity binding to human and monkey Dll4, as measured in SPR
Biacore experiments, but did not bind to murine Dll4 or human
Dll1 and Dll3 (Supplementary Table S1 and data not shown). The
equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for REGN421 binding to
monomeric and dimeric Fc-fusion of human Dll4 were determined as 161 pmol/L and 5.1 pmol/L, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). KD values for REGN421 binding to monkey Dll4
were 183 pmol/L and 5.85 pmol/L for monomeric and dimeric
protein, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The high similarity between the equilibrium dissociation constants of human
and monkey Dll4 are consistent with the high sequence homology of these two proteins (98%). Epitope mapping revealed
REGN421 binding to the junction of N-terminal and DSL domain
within the Dll4 extracellular domain (data not shown).
In ELISA, REGN421 bound human Dll4 protein with an EC50 of
88 pmol/L and inhibited human Dll4 binding to Notch1 with an
IC50 of 95.3 pmol/L (Fig. 1A and B). In cell-based assays,
REGN421 blocked Dll4-mediated Notch signaling in dosedependent manner with an IC50 of 21 pmol/L (Fig. 1C).
In addition, the ability of REGN421 to inhibit endogenous
Dll4-Notch interactions was assayed in the HUVEC-based ﬁbrin
bead sprouting assay. REGN421 treatment resulted in a signiﬁcantly increased number of branch points and endothelial cells
per bead relative to control antibody (Fig. 1D). The induction of
these hallmarks of impaired Dll4-Notch signaling in endothelial
cells (9) demonstrates that REGN421 functions as a potent and
speciﬁc inhibitor of Dll4-Notch signaling.
REGN421 potently inhibits tumor xenograft growth and
induces aberrant tumor angiogenesis
To assess the effect of REGN421 on human tumor growth in
preclinical xenograft models, humanized Dll4 (huDll4) SCID
mice, in which the region of the mouse Dll4 gene encoding the
extracellular domain were replaced with the equivalent region of
the human Dll4 gene, were generated. Administration of REGN421
antibody (10 mg/kg, 3/week) to huDll4 mice with established
subcutaneous HT1080 (sarcoma) or Colo205 (colorectal) human

REGN421 potently inhibits endothelial Dll4-Notch signaling. A, REGN421 at the indicated concentrations was added to plate-bound human Dll4. The EC50 for
REGN421 binding to human Dll4 was determined as 88 pmol/L. B, the ability of REGN421 to block human Dll4 binding to Notch1 was tested in a competition

C, coating of Dll4 at the indicated concentrations established a dose-dependent response curve of Notch reporter activation (closed circles) with an EC50 of

three-dimensional endothelial cell growth and sprouting were analyzed in the ﬁbrin bead assay. Representative images of maximum intensity projections at 10

tumors resulted in potent inhibition of tumor growth with 113%
and 94% tumor growth inhibition (TGI), respectively (Fig. 2A).
Notably, REGN421 is highly active in the HT1080 tumor model,
which was previously demonstrated to be resistant to VEGF inhibition (14). Immunohistological analysis revealed dramatic
changes in the tumor vasculature in both xenograft models
(Fig. 2B), demonstrating that REGN421 is effective in xenograft
tumor models with very different vascular morphologies.
To determine the effective dose range at which REGN421
inhibits HT1080 tumor growth, dose titrations were performed.
Dose levels of REGN421 as low as 1 mg/kg administered twice

weekly resulted in maximal inhibition of HT1080 tumor growth
(114% TGI), with doses down to 0.3 mg/kg still producing
signiﬁcant antitumor effects (Fig. 2C). For once-weekly dosing
regimens, a dose of REGN421 of 2.5 mg/kg was found to be
maximally effective (Fig. 2D). Pharmacokinetic analysis of
REGN421 in huDll4 mice showed evidence of target-mediated
clearance (REGN421 half-life of 90 hours vs. 284 hours in huDll4
vs. wild-type mice) and indicated that doses of REGN421 achieving sustained circulating levels of  2 mg/mL correlated with
maximal antitumor activity in the HT1080 model (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Potent antitumor activity of Dll4 blockade in ovarian xenograft
models is dependent on targeting Dll4 in the stroma
Angiogenesis plays an important role in ovarian physiology
and cancer, and antiangiogenic agents have demonstrated clinical
beneﬁt in this disease. Thus, we evaluated the activity of REGN421
in several ovarian xenograft models. REGN421 treatment
(2.5 mg/kg, once weekly) of huDll4 mice bearing established
intraperitoneal A2780 or subcutaneous TOV-112D, SKOV-3, or
OV90 human xenografts resulted in tumor growth inhibition of
83%, 86%, 61%, and 55%, respectively (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Fig. S2). The inhibition of A2780 ovarian tumor growth
by REGN421 was associated with a marked increase in tumor
vascular structures but reduced vascular perfusion (Fig. 3C). To
delineate the relative contributions of blocking stromal versus
tumor cell expressed Dll4 to antitumor efﬁcacy, we treated wildtype SCID mice bearing established intraperitoneal A2780 tumors
with either REGN1035, selectively blocking murine Dll4, or with
human Dll4-speciﬁc REGN421 to achieve selective targeting of
host (mouse) versus tumor (human) Dll4. Potent A2780 tumor

4090 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

growth inhibition (70% TGI) was observed by strictly targeting
stromal Dll4 with REGN1035 (at a fully effective dose of 5 mg/kg,
1/week) in SCID mice (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the speciﬁc blockade of tumor cell–expressed human Dll4 did not exhibit any
appreciable anti-A2780 tumor activity (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the
targeting of stromal Dll4 with REGN1035 resulted in marked
growth inhibition of subcutaneous TOV-112D (74% TGI), SKOV3 (64% TGI), and OVCAR-3 tumors (84% TGI) and associated
tumor vessel abnormalization. In contrast, the selective blockade
of tumor cell Dll4 did not inhibit TOV-112D tumor growth
(Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). These ﬁndings are consistent
with the restricted Dll4 expression in the tumor vasculature of
ovarian xenograft tumors (Fig. 3D; Supplementary Fig. S4).
Paracrine Dll4-Notch signaling in ovarian xenograft tumors
The blockade of Dll4 results in potent antitumor effects in
ovarian xenograft tumors; the degree of tumor growth inhibition,
however, is variable between the different models. Thus, we
investigated the possibility of paracrine signaling between

The potent antitumor activity of Dll4 blockade in ovarian xenograft models is dependent on targeting Dll4 in the stroma. A, humanized Dll4 SCID mice
bearing established intraperitoneal A2780 human xenograft tumors were treated once weekly with hFc or REGN421 at 2.5 mg/kg for 4 weeks. At the end of study,
animals treated with hFc control protein exhibited multiple, large intraperitoneal A2780 tumors (arrows), whereas treatment with REGN421 quantitatively
suppressed A2780 tumor growth. B, humanized Dll4 or wild-type SCID mice bearing established A2780 tumors were treated once weekly with human Dll4-blocking
REGN421 (2.5 mg/kg) or with the mouse Dll4-speciﬁc blocker REGN1035 (5 mg/kg) versus hFc control protein to delineate the selective targeting of stromal
versus tumor cell–expressed Dll4. Bar graphs represent end of study ex vivo tumor weight. Error bars represent SEM. Tumor weight was compared with
the hFc control groups by unpaired t test ( , P < 0.05). C, immunohistochemical evaluation of microvascular density by CD31 staining in A2780 tumors implanted into

endothelial cell Dll4 and tumor cell–expressed Notch receptors,
which could contribute to some of the observed variability in
response to Dll4 blockade. Analysis of Notch receptor expression
by ﬂow cytometry and Western blot analysis demonstrated Notch
receptor expression in 4 of 5 ovarian xenograft cell lines, with only
OV90 cells staining negatively for all four Notch receptors. Notch1
was found to be prominently expressed in the ovarian cell lines,
whereas Notch2, Notch3, and Notch4 expression was more
variable (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S5A). Immunoﬂuorescence
staining conﬁrmed tumor cell expression of Notch1, in addition
to its expression in the tumor vasculature, in ovarian xenograft
tumors (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S5B).

To interrogate Notch signaling in ovarian cell lines, we engineered TOV-112D cells to express the RBPj-luciferase Notch
signaling reporter. Notch reporter assays demonstrated activation
of Notch signaling by both exogenous human and mouse Dll4
protein in TOV-112D cells (Fig. 4C). As expected, Notch signaling
activation could be suppressed by treatment with the respective
human and mouse Dll4-speciﬁc blocking antibodies (Fig. 4C). To
determine which Notch receptors mediate the Dll4-dependent
activation of the RBPj reporter in TOV-112D cells, we evaluated
Notch1- and Notch3-speciﬁc function-blocking antibodies.
Notch1 antibody treatment partially suppressed RBPj-Notch
reporter activation (71% inhibition), whereas the targeting of

(arrows) C, Notch signaling activation was assessed in TOV-112D cells stably expressing a RBPj-luciferase reporter. EC50 for human and mouse Dll4 were
determined as 0.5 nmol/L and 0.4 nmol/L, respectively. For inhibition assays, Dll4 was coated onto plates at 11 nmol/L. Dll4 antibodies at indicated doses were
preincubated with TOV112D/RBPj-luc cells prior to plate addition. IC50 for REGN421 and REGN1035 are 1.5 nmol/L. D, Notch1-ICD staining of sections from

Notch 3 did not appreciably affect RBPj reporter activation (Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, Notch1 but not the putative ovarian
cancer oncogene Notch3 appears to be a major mediator of Notch
signaling in TOV-112D cells. We next evaluated Notch1 signaling
activity in ovarian xenograft tumors in vivo by immunohistochemical staining for Notch1 intracellular domain (N1-ICD). Staining of
A2780 and TOV-112D tumors demonstrated strong nuclear
expression and thus active Notch1 signaling in endothelial cells
of tumor vessels (Fig. 4D). In addition, N1-ICD expression was also
frequently detected in the tumor parenchyma immediately adjacent to N1-ICDþ endothelial cells (Fig. 4D), a pattern consistent
with spatially restricted, paracrine signaling interactions between
membrane-tethered endothelial Dll4 and Notch1 receptor
expressed by ovarian tumor cells. Tumor cell identity of the N1ICDþ cells adjacent to tumor vessels with active Notch1 signaling
was conﬁrmed by costaining for human vimentin (Fig. 4D).
To evaluate the effects of acute blockade of stromal Dll4 on
Notch1 signaling, ovarian tumor–bearing mice were treated with
REGN1035 (speciﬁc for murine Dll4) for 24 hours, and tumors
were analyzed for N1-ICD levels. REGN1035 treatment resulted

4092 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

in a marked reduction of nuclear N1-ICD immunostaining in
endothelial cells, indicating the suppression of endothelial Dll4Notch1 signaling (Fig. 4D). In addition, stromal targeting of Dll4
also reduced Notch1 activity in tumor cells that surrounded the
tumor vasculature (Fig. 4D), indicating that the blockade of
endothelial Dll4 also disrupts juxtacrine Dll4-Notch1 signaling
interactions.
Combinatorial blockade of Dll4 and VEGF signaling results in
enhanced ovarian tumor growth inhibition
VEGF-directed targeted therapy has shown clinical beneﬁt
and has recently been approved as a treatment modality in
ovarian cancer (32). Therefore, we tested whether the blockade
of Dll4-Notch combined with VEGF blockade could enhance
antitumor efﬁcacy in ovarian xenograft models. Intraperitoneal
A2780-tumor bearing SCID mice were treated with REGN1035,
the VEGF blocker aﬂibercept (ziv-aﬂibercept in the United
States; commonly known in the literature as VEGF Trap; ref. 33),
or the combination thereof starting 1 week after tumor cell
implantation (early treatment regimen) for a total of 4 weeks.

Combinatorial blockade of Dll4 and VEGF results in enhanced inhibition of A2780 ovarian tumor growth. A, SCID mice bearing intraperitoneal A2780 tumors
were treated with REGN1035, the VEGF blocker aﬂibercept, or the combination thereof at the indicated doses (mg/kg) starting 1 week after tumor cell
implantation for a total of 4 weeks. Treatment regimen is outlined in the scheme at the top; arrows indicate dosing. The bar graphs represent end of study ex vivo
tumor weight. B, table summarizing survival frequency of A2780-bearing SCID mice treated with the indicated reagents (mg/kg) on day 38 after tumor cell

weight of SCID mice bearing intraperitoneal A2780 tumors on day 38 after tumor cell implantation following the treatment paradigm from B. Error bars
represent SEM. Treatment groups were compared by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison test ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;   , P < 0.001).

Ex vivo A2780 tumor weight was determined at the end of
treatment. Both REGN1035 (5 mg/kg, 1/week) and aﬂibercept (5 mg/kg, 2/week) exhibited potent antitumor effects as
single agents in this regimen, producing 70% and 88% TGI,
respectively (Fig. 5A). Notably, combined treatment with
REGN1035 and aﬂibercept resulted in enhanced antitumor
effects (97% TGI) and virtually complete suppression of intraperitoneal A2780 tumor growth (Fig. 5A). In a late treatment
regimen, treatment of A2780 tumor-bearing mice was initiated
2 weeks after tumor cell inoculation. Mice were treated with
aﬂibercept (5 mg/kg, 2/week), REGN1035 at fully effective
dose of 5 mg/kg, and suboptimal doses of 1 mg/kg and 0.2
mg/kg, all administered 1/week as well as with the respective
combinations. Animals in the control and the REGN1035
single-agent treatment groups died or were terminated early
due to excessive tumor burden, although REGN1035 showed
dose-dependent antitumor activity (Supplementary Table S2).
Single-agent aﬂibercept and combination therapy treatment
groups were analyzed on day 38 after tumor cell implantation.
Although signiﬁcant mortality was observed in the aﬂibercept
alone and the 0.2 mg/kg REGN1035 plus aﬂibercept treatment
groups (33% and 60% survival, respectively), survival rates for
the 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg REGN1035/aﬂibercept combination
groups at day 38 were 100% (Fig. 5B). Analysis of intraperitoneal tumor burden at day 38 conﬁrmed that combined
administration of REGN1035 and aﬂibercept resulted in signiﬁcantly enhanced inhibition of A2780 tumor growth relative
to the single-agent aﬂibercept control (Fig. 5C). Importantly,

survival beneﬁts and enhanced inhibition of A2780 tumor
growth of the REGN1035/aﬂibercept combinations were found
to be dose-dependent and were also observed when suboptimal
1 mg/kg doses of REGN1035 were administered in combination with aﬂibercept (Fig. 5B and C).
Combinatorial blockade of Dll4 and VEGF reverses normal
organ vascular changes induced by Dll4 blockade alone
Published reports suggest that chronic blockade of Dll4
results in pathologic activation of endothelial cells and vascular
tumorigenesis in select organs (34, 35). Thus, we examined
normal organs from adult humanized Dll4 SCID mice treated
with REGN421 at fully effective dose of 2.5 mg/kg, given once
weekly for a total of 3 weeks by histologic and immunohistochemical analysis. Treatment with REGN421 induced reversible
vascular changes selectively in heart and liver of humanized
Dll4 SCID mice but not in other organs (lung, kidney, kidneyassociated adipose tissue, jejunum, stomach, pancreas, skeletal
muscle, spleen, skin, retina). Vascular beds of hearts from
REGN421-treated mice exhibited increased vascularity relative
to hFc control, as assessed by CD31 staining (Fig 6A) as well as
an increase in Ki67-positive proliferating cells (Fig. 6B). Costaining for CD31 and Ki67 demonstrated that REGN421induced proliferation was restricted to endothelial cells (Fig.
6C). REGN421 effects on heart vascularity were found to be
dose-dependent. Thus, doses of REGN421 of 1 mg/kg given
once weekly did not induce heart endothelial proliferation in
humanized Dll4 mice (Fig. 6D).

Notably, heart vascular changes induced by Dll4 blockade
were entirely dependent on VEGF signaling activity. Coadministration of REGN421 and aﬂibercept (10 mg/kg, twice weekly)
quantitatively reversed heart vascular phenotypes induced by
REGN421 single-agent treatment (Fig. 6A, B, and D). A similar
increase in vascularity and endothelial cell proliferation, as well
as mild sinusoidal dilations, was observed in livers from
REGN421-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S7). Again, liver
vascular changes were found to be reversible upon cessation of
treatment, dose-dependent, and could be blocked by the simultaneous targeting of VEGF (Supplementary Fig. S7). Vascular
phenotypes in response to REGN421 treatment in heart and
liver correlated with Dll4 expression and Dll4-dependent
Notch1 signaling activity in the endothelium of these organs
(Supplementary Figs. S8 and S9).

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the antitumor efﬁcacy of Dll4
antagonism and the mechanisms of Dll4-Notch signaling in
ovarian tumors using a fully human Dll4 antibody, REGN421.
Because REGN421 selectively blocks human but not mouse Dll4,
we engineered humanized Dll4 mice to enable preclinical studies.
In addition, we developed selective anti-mouse Dll4 antibodies,
allowing us to delineate the relative contributions of blocking
stromal versus tumor cell–expressed Dll4. We demonstrated that
REGN421 displays potent antitumor activity in several ovarian
xenograft models, and that the antitumor activity of blocking Dll4
in ovarian tumors is dependent on targeting stromal, but not
tumor cell, Dll4. These ﬁndings illustrate the lack of tumor

growth-promoting autocrine Dll4-Notch tumor cell signaling in
the employed models and are consistent with the relative absence
of tumor parenchymal Dll4 expression in the ovarian xenograft
tumors. Antitumor activity of targeting host Dll4 was recently also
demonstrated in patient-derived renal carcinoma (PDX) models
(36).
One would expect tumor cell Dll4 expression and signiﬁcance
of autocrine Dll4-Notch signaling to be tumor model and type
speciﬁc. Indeed, contributions of autocrine Dll4-Notch signaling
to xenograft tumor growth have been described in ovarian and
colorectal tumor models (23, 37). Our immunohistological analyses indicate consistent expression of Dll4 in the tumor vasculature, but only sporadic parenchymal expression. These ﬁndings
are in agreement with reports on Dll4 expression in different
human tumor types (18, 19, 21), although one study suggests
more widespread Dll4 expression in human ovarian cancer (23).
In this latter study, antitumor efﬁcacy for targeting tumor cell–
expressed Dll4 was reported (23); however, siRNA approaches
were used and may explain the differences in results (38).
In the current study, we provide evidence of paracrine signaling
interactions between endothelial cell Dll4 and Notch receptors
expressed by adjacent tumor cells. Thus, we detected the selective
and Dll4-dependent activation of Notch1 signaling in ovarian
tumor cells immediately adjacent to tumor vessels. The functional
signiﬁcance of paracrine Dll4-Notch1 signaling in ovarian tumorigenesis remains to be determined. This question may be
addressed preclinically by examining the effects of human
Notch1-speciﬁc blockers or selective Notch1 knockdown on
ovarian xenograft growth. It is conceivable that the spatially
restricted paracrine Dll4-Notch1 interactions contribute to the

Dll4 Blockade in Ovarian Tumors

vascular niche thought to regulate tumor initiating cell maintenance and expansion (37, 39). Conﬂicting datasets exist as to
Notch signaling activity in human ovarian cancer (31, 40). Our
data support the careful evaluation of Notch1 signaling activity in
human ovarian cancer, in particular in perivascular regions.
The paracrine interactions between membrane-bound endothelial Dll4 ligand and tumor cell–expressed Notch receptors
require signaling across the tumor vessel wall. Like normal vessels,
tumor vessels are composed of endothelial cells, mural cells,
(pericytes or smooth muscle cells) and a basement membrane.
In tumor vessels, endothelial cell-pericyte and basement membrane interactions are typically impaired (41), thereby creating
opportunities for direct physical interactions between endothelial
and tumor cells. We have conﬁrmed that vessels in the ovarian
tumor models are only partially covered with pericytes (Supplementary Fig. S10). Furthermore, although one would expect the
interactions between the different cell types within the tumor
microenvironment to be dynamic, we have identiﬁed apparent
areas of direct contact between endothelial and tumor cells by
confocal microscopy analysis (Supplementary Figs. S10 and S11),
a prerequisite for the paracrine Dll4-Notch signaling interactions
explored in this article.
We demonstrated in this study that the antitumor activity of
Dll4 blockade in ovarian tumors was augmented by the concomitant targeting of VEGF signaling. This ﬁnding is consistent with
published studies reporting potent combination effects for the
simultaneous blockade of Dll4 and VEGF in preclinical models
(15, 23, 36). Importantly, we found that the combination beneﬁts
of ovarian tumor growth inhibition were dose-dependent and
observed even when suboptimal doses of anti-Dll4 antibodies
were combined with VEGF blockers. Mechanistically, studies in
various model systems have established that Dll4-Notch signaling
can provide negative feedback to reduce the activity of the VEGF
axis during angiogenic sprouting (4, 5). This model also applies to
tumor angiogenesis; however, additional complexities appear to
exist in the tumor microenvironment and further investigation is
warranted to elucidate the mechanisms of synergy of combined
targeting of these two angiogenic signaling systems (42, 43).
Published reports suggest that the chronic blockade of Dll4
results in pathologic activation of endothelial cells and vascular
tumorigenesis (35, 44). Similarly, loss of Dll4 or Notch1 function
in genetic mouse models led to the activation of liver endothelial
cells and the formation of hepatic vascular lesions (34, 45). We
have found that prolonged treatment with REGN421 induced
vascular changes selectively in heart and liver of humanized Dll4

SCID mice but not in other organs. In particular, we did not
observe subcutaneous ulcerative vascular lesions in mice that were
previously reported (35) in rats. Similar to what was reported, we
found the vascular proliferation to be dose dependent and reversible upon cessation of treatment (35). Importantly, liver and heart
vascular changes were dependent on VEGF signaling activity.
Collectively, these data suggest that combined blockade of Dll4
and VEGF signaling may increase the therapeutic window for
antiangiogenesis-based therapy of ovarian and other solid
malignancies.
Overall, this study illustrates the power of using humanized
mouse models for the evaluation of non-mouse cross-reactive
clinical candidates. REGN421 is currently in a phase I trial
(NCT00871559) for patients with advanced solid malignancies
(46). The ﬁndings presented in this study lend further support for
the therapeutic targeting of Dll4 as a promising new antiangiogenesis strategy in ovarian cancer and suggest particular clinical
beneﬁt for the blockade of Dll4 with REGN421 in combination
with the targeting of VEGF signaling.
