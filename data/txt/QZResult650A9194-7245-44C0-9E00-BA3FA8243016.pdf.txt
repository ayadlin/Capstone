ABSTRACT
Purpose: Histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) is an important protein in neural and
cardiac diseases and a potential drug target. However, little is known regarding the
specific role of HDAC5 in breast cancer (BC). We aimed to evaluate HDAC5 expression
in human breast tumors and to determine the effects of the inhibition of HDAC5
expression in BC cells.
Experimental design: HDAC5 expression was evaluated in BC patients and was
correlated with clinical features and with patient prognosis. Functional experiments
were performed using shRNA and the selective HDAC inhibitor LMK-235 for HDAC5
knockdown and inhibition in BC cells. The synergistic effects of LMK-235 with the
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib were also examined.
Results: HDAC5 was extensively expressed in human BC tissues, and high
HDAC5 expression was associated with an inferior prognosis. Knockdown of HDAC5
inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and enhanced apoptosis. The HDAC5
inhibitor LMK-235 inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis, while the inclusion of
bortezomib synergistically enhanced the efficacy of LMK-235.
Conclusions: Our findings indicate that HDAC5 is a promising prognostic marker
and drug target for BC and that the combination of LMK-235 and bortezomib presents
a novel therapeutic strategy for BC.

activities such as synoviocyte activation [2], neural
regeneration and repair [3], and myoblast differentiation [4].
Recent studies have reported the aberrant overexpression
of HDAC5 in hepatocellular carcinoma [5] and high-risk
medulloblastoma [6], whereas HDAC5 downregulation
has been reported in colon cancer [7] and is associated
with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients [8]. Moreover,
Peixoto et al. demonstrated that HDAC5 maintains
pericentric heterochromatin structures in human cancer
cells and thus represents a potential anticancer drug target
[9]. Subsequently, Hsieh et al. reported that pan-HDAC
inhibitors (pan-HDACis) induce BC apoptosis via the
upregulation of microRNA (miR)-125a-5p, which posttranscriptionally silences HDAC5 [10].

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer
and the leading cause of cancer-related death in women.
Advances in novel adjuvant therapies have markedly
decreased BC-related mortality [1]. However, the problems
of drug resistance and distant metastasis remain unresolved
and have resulted in inadequate patient survival. To address
these issues, more effective and less toxic targeted therapies
are urgently required to improve the cure rate.
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that
function in epigenetic gene regulation through chromatin
modification. Among 18 human HDACs, HDAC5 (a class
IIa HDAC) has been found to contribute to dynamic

HDACis are inhibitors that induce apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest and that impede metastasis, invasion and
angiogenesis in cancer cells [11]; thus, they have emerged
as exciting new anticancer agents. However, beyond the
potent clinical efficacy of pan-HDACis, unfavorable
side effects should not be overlooked. Since the class
IIb-selective HDACi ricolinostat has been reported to
be well tolerated [12], class-selective HDACis should be
considered preferentially. LMK-235 is a novel HDACi that
exhibits HDAC isoform selectivity, with a preference for
HDAC4 and HDAC5 [13]. LMK-235 displays equipotent
HDAC inhibition compared with vorinostat and potent
cytotoxicity. In addition, many studies have proposed
that HDACis effectively synergize with other diverse
anticancer agents that exert antineoplastic effects [14, 15].
Among various synergistic models, the combination of
HDACis and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has
shown undisputed success [16, 17].
Here, we aimed to exploit the potential therapeutic
role of HDAC5 in BC. First, we investigated HDAC5
expression patterns and their correlation with
clinicopathologic features and prognosis in patients with
BC. Second, functional studies were performed to examine
the results of HDAC5 loss on tumor biology. Finally, we
investigated the activity of the novel HDACi LMK-235
and the combined effects of LMK-235 and bortezomib on
BC cells.

significant decrease in DFS (HR=2.148; 95% CI: 1.0374.449; p=0.0396; Figure 1A), whereas no significant
difference was observed in OS (HR=0.9480; 95% CI:
0.287-3.129; p=0.9295).
In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry
(IHC) to evaluate HDAC5 protein expression on
tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 450 breast
tumor samples. In all, 350 samples were available for
observation. HDAC5 was predominantly expressed in
the cytoplasm of malignant epithelial cells (Figure 1B).
A score of >190 was defined as the cut-off point based
on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis. Thus, the patients were divided into two groups
according to HDAC5 protein expression: 235 (67%) with
low expression and 115 (33%) with high expression. The
clinicopathological features that correlated with HDAC5
protein expression are presented in Supplementary Table
S3. High HDAC5 protein expression was significantly
associated with metastasis (p=0.001), which was
consistent with the mRNA results. The prognostic value
of HDAC5 protein expression in terms of DFS and
OS was similar to that of HDAC5 mRNA expression
for the 350 patients. During a median follow-up of
95.4 months (range, 2.1-143.9 months), 59 patients
(16.9%) experienced metastatic relapse, and 34 patients
(9.7%) died from disease progression. The multivariate
prognostic analysis and the Kaplan-Meier survival curve
for this cohort were concordant with those for the qPCR
cohort. HDAC5 protein expression (HR=1.94; 95% CI:
1.23-3.05; p=0.004) and LN status (HR=1.41; 95% CI:
1.15-1.74; p=0.001) were independent factors for DFS
(Supplementary Table S4). High expression of HDAC5
at the protein level correlated with a significant decrease
in DFS (HR=1.72; 95% CI: 1.057-3.796; p=0.029;
Figure 1C), whereas no correlation was observed with
OS (HR=1.50; 95% CI: 0.731-3.078; p=0.269).

RESULTS
HDAC5 overexpression promotes BC metastasis
and correlates with an inferior prognosis
To investigate the potential relevance of
HDAC5 expression in BC tissues in terms of clinical
characteristics, HDAC5 mRNA expression was examined
in 149 breast tumor samples. The median patient age
was 51 years (range, 30-82 years). Quantitative real-time
PCR (qPCR) revealed that 75 (50.3%) patients had high
HDAC5 mRNA expression. Clinical and histopathologic
characteristics grouped by HDAC5 mRNA expression
level are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. High
HDAC5 mRNA expression was significantly associated
with distant metastasis (p<0.028) and molecular subtype
(p=0.009). Next, we assessed the prognostic value of
HDAC5 mRNA expression in terms of disease-free
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). During a
median follow-up of 51.2 months (range, 4.6-82.7
months), 23 patients (15.4%) experienced metastatic
relapse, and 10 (6.7%) deaths occurred. Multivariate Cox
regression analysis showed that HDAC5 expression was
an independent factor associated with DFS (HR=2.33;
95% CI: 1.00-5.30; p=0.04) and lymph node (LN) status
(HR=1.37; 95% CI: 1.00-1.87; p=0.047; Supplementary
Table S2). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve demonstrated
that HDAC5 overexpression was correlated with a

Knockdown of HDAC5 decreases cell
proliferation and induces apoptosis in BC cell
lines
To determine the functional effects of HDAC5
on the biological behaviors of breast cancer cells,
basal HDAC5 protein expression was evaluated in
eleven breast epithelial cell lines; HeLa cells served
as a positive control. As shown in Figure 2A, HDAC5
protein expression was relatively higher in BC cells than
in the two normal breast cell lines. MDA-MB-231 and
Hs-578T cells were transiently transfected with shRNA
against HDAC5, and HDAC5 downregulation was
confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure 2B). On the
contrary, the levels of acetyl-histone H3 were increased
after knockdown of HDAC5 in both MDA-MB-231
and Hs-578T cells (Figure 2B). As shown in Figure 2C,
the knockdown of HDAC5 significantly decreased cell
proliferation. In addition, flow cytometry showed that

on the level of acetyl-histone H3. As shown in Figure
4B, increased concentrations of LMK-235 induced the
accumulation of acetyl-histone H3. MDA-MB-231,
Hs-578T, SK-BR-3, and MCF-7 cells were exposed
to increasing concentrations of LMK-235 (0, 0.625,
1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 µM; Figure 4C) for 24 and
48 hours. The relative proliferation of the cell lines
decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cell
viability was severely compromised after 48 hours of
treatment with minimal doses of LMK-235. Long-term
clonogenic assays confirmed the growth inhibition
induced by LMK-235 at lower concentrations of
0 to 800 nM (Figure 4D). In order to examine the
effects of HDAC5 in response to LMK-235, HDAC5
knockdown cells were treated with 1.25 µM LMK-235
for 48 hours. In the presence of LMK-235, the relative
proliferation of HDAC5 knockdown cells was further
decreased compared with the non-treated knockdown
cells (p<0.05; Figure 4E). However, no significant
difference was observed between negative control cells

HDAC5 deficiency impedes BC cell migration
and invasion
Wound-healing assays demonstrated that HDAC5
knockdown significantly inhibited MDA-MB-231
and Hs-578T cell migration by ~58% and ~30%,
respectively (Figure 3A and 3B). Moreover, HDAC5
deficiency markedly inhibited the invasiveness of
MDA-MB-231 and Hs-578T cells (~57% and ~73%,
respectively; Figure 3C and 3D).

LMK-235 inhibits proliferation and induces
apoptosis of BC cells
The effects of HDAC5 inhibition were examined
using the HDACi LMK-235. The HDAC specificity
of LMK-235 was validated by measuring its effect

and HDAC5 knockdown cells in the presence of LMK235 (p>0.05; Figure 4E). Furthermore, the inhibition
of proliferation by LMK-235 occurred in a dose- and
time-dependent manner along with the increased
protein expression of the apoptosis markers Bim,
caspase 8 and caspase 9, as well as PARP cleavage
(Figure 4F and 4G). The data from flow cytometric

HDAC5 knockdown cells (p<0.05).

LMK-235 synergizes with bortezomib in BC cell
lines
MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells were treated with a
single drug or with combinations of various concentrations
of LMK-235 and bortezomib for 48 hours. As shown in
Figure 5B, the combination of LMK-235 and bortezomib
yielded stronger cytotoxic effects compared with either
drug alone. The synergism between LMK-235 and
bortezomib was analyzed by isobolograms of IC60 (Figure
5C). The isoboles lie to the left of the additive isoboles,
which indicated synergistic action. The combination
indices further demonstrated the synergistic cytotoxicity
(Supplementary Table S5). Furthermore, the combined
treatments exhibited strong effects on the induction of
apoptosis, as determined by flow cytometry and western
blot in both cell lines after 24 hours of treatment (Figure

Knockdown of HDAC5 enhances the cytotoxic
effects of bortezomib
HDAC5 knockdown cells and negative control
cells were treated with 50 nM bortezomib for 48 hours.
Compared with non-treated cells, bortezomib inhibited
cell proliferation of negative control MDA-MB-231 and
Hs-578T cells by ~36% and ~50%, respectively (p<0.05;
Figure 5A). Moreover, the knockdown of HDAC5 further
enhanced the cytotoxicity of bortezomib compared with

were seeded in Matrigel invasion chambers and treated
with low nanomolar concentrations of LMK-235 and/or
bortezomib to prevent the cytotoxic effects on cell growth.
Surprisingly, we found that the combination treatment
significantly impeded cell migration (Figure 5F). The
expression levels of MMP2, MMP7, and MMP9 were also
downregulated by the combination treatment (Figure 5G).

functional studies confirmed the oncogenic effects of
HDAC5 in BC, which are consistent with the findings of
Hsieh et al. [10].
Notably, HDAC5 (a class IIa HDAC) shuttles
between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in response
to certain cellular signals. Milde et al. reported that
cellular HDAC5 staining in primary medulloblastoma
was predominantly nuclear [6]. However, in our study,
HDAC5 was primarily localized in the cytoplasm in BC
cells. Nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of HDAC5 has
been reported to be involved in the cellular differentiation
that occurs during muscle and axon regeneration [3, 4].
In carcinogenesis, the expression patterns and underlying
mechanism of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC5
warrant further investigation.
HDAC5 and HDAC9 are valuable markers for
medulloblastoma risk stratification and are potential novel

DISCUSSION
The role of HDAC5 in tumorigenesis and cancer
progression is controversial [7-8]. The present study
shows that HDAC5 mRNA and protein were both widely
expressed in breast tumor tissues and that the relatively
high expression of HDAC5 was associated with an
inferior prognosis in patients with BC. In addition,

inhibitors were previously unavailable. Ecker et al.
investigated the effects of the class IIa HDACis MAZ1863
and MAZ1866, which unfortunately failed to reduce
metabolic activity in the medulloblastoma cell lines that
were assessed [18]. In contrast, LMK-235, a novel class
IIa HDACi with a preference for HDAC4 and HDAC5,

displayed potent cytotoxic effects in human cancer cell
lines [13]. Indeed, LMK-235 significantly attenuated cell
proliferation in our study.
Moreover, LMK-235 synergized with the
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and further inhibited
cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and impeded cell
invasion at lower nanomolar concentrations, which

indicates that this combination therapy is more tolerable
for patients. Although the potent activity of HDACis in
combination with bortezomib is well documented, the
underlying mechanisms remain unclear [19]. Kikuchi et
al. demonstrated that the knockdown of class IIa HDAC4
enhances cytotoxicity induced by the proteasome inhibitor
carfilzomib in multiple myeloma via the upregulation
of activating transcription factor 4 and the activation of

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced pro-apoptotic
transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein [20].
This finding provides the rationale for the combination
of class IIa HDAC inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors.
Due to the similarity of HDAC4 and HDAC5, we assume
that HDAC5 might be involved in ER stress-induced cell
apoptosis. However, further studies are warranted to verify
this assumption.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In summary, our study provides compelling evidence
for the important role of HDAC5 in BC progression. The
clinical results showed that high HDAC5 expression
correlates with inferior prognostic factors and is associated
with a worse DFS. In vitro studies highlighted the
tumorigenic behavior of HDAC5 in human BC cells. In
addition, this finding supports the use of a promising new
inhibitor, LMK-235, for inhibiting HDAC5 in BC. LMK235 in combination with bortezomib provides a novel
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of BC.

Patients and tissue samples
All samples were randomly retrieved from the
Department of Pathology at Fudan University Shanghai
Cancer Center between January 1, 2001 and December
31, 2009. In all, 149 fresh tissues and 350 formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples fulfilled the following
criteria and were selected for this study: (i) female patients

stained area (H score=[I0×P0]+[I1×P1]+[I2×P2]+[I3×P3]).

Cell culture and treatments
BC cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, ZR-75-1, SK-BR-3,
Hs-578T, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468,
and MDA-MB-453), normal breast cell lines (MCF-10A and
HBL-100), and HeLa cells were kindly provided by Professor
ZM Shao (Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center,
Shanghai) and were cultured according to standard ATCC
protocols. Cells were seeded at an approximate concentration
and were cultured under standard incubation conditions
(37 °C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2) for 24 hours before the
following experiments were performed: (1) transfection
with sh-HDAC5 (Origene) or a scrambled control shRNA
sequence, (2) treatment with LMK-235 (Selleck Chemicals)
or DMSO (vehicle control), (3) treatment with bortezomib
(Selleck Chemicals) or DMSO, and (4) treatment with both
LMK-235 and bortezomib or DMSO.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were
performed as described previously [21]. Briefly, RNA
was extracted using an RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen),
and reverse transcription was performed with 2 µg of
total RNA. Then, the cDNA was subjected to qPCR
to evaluate the relative mRNA levels of HDAC5 and
GAPDH (as an internal control) in an ABI 7900HT
qPCR machine (Applied Biosystems). The gene-specific
primers are presented in Supplementary Table S6. Data
were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle
method (2-ΔCT).

Western blot analysis
Equal amounts of cell lysates were subjected to
7.5% to 15% SDS–PAGE, and proteins were transferred
onto PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membranes were
probed overnight with specific primary antibodies, which
were detected with corresponding secondary antibodies
(Cell Signaling Technology). The immunoreactive bands
were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence
(Thermo Scientific). The following primary antibodies
were used: HDAC5 (Abcam); GAPDH (Proteintech);
acetyl-histone H3, histone H3, caspase-8, caspase-9,
PARP, Bim, MMP2, MMP7, and MMP9 (Cell Signaling
Technology). GAPDH served as a loading control.

Tissue microarray construction
TMAs were prepared from 450 blocks of IDC
samples. The matching histological hematoxylin and eosin
(HE)-stained slides were reviewed and representative areas
were identified by two experienced pathologists. Two
1.0-mm-diameter cylinders of tissue were arrayed into
a recipient block using a tissue microarrayer (UNITMA
Instruments) as described previously [22]. In addition,
10 samples of non-tumor breast tissue were included as
controls.

shRNA transfection
HDAC5 pGFP-V-RS shRNA vectors were purchased
from Origene (catalog number TG312492). Sequences of
shRNA constructs are described in Supplementary Table
S7. An inactive 29-mer scrambled shRNA cassette in the
pGFP-V-RS vector was used as a negative control. All
transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 3000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Two (sh-HDAC5#B and sh-HDAC5#D) of four constructs
with greater efficiency were selected for the following
experiments.

Immunohistochemical staining
TMA slides were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and
then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against
HDAC5 (Abcam) at 4°C overnight following heat-induced
epitope retrieval. Staining detection was performed using
a Dako LSAB+ System-HRP detection kit according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. An appropriate negative
control was included throughout.
HDAC5 immunoreactivity was scored semiquantitatively by two experienced pathologists who were blinded
to the patients’ clinical information. The H score was based
on the intensity (I0, negative; I1, weak; I2, moderate; and I3,
strong) and proportion (P: 0%, 5%, 10% … 100%, in 5%
increments) of positively stained cells, as described previously
[23]. Discordant results were resolved by a second examination
by two pathologists simultaneously using a multi-headed
microscope. A final H score (range, 0–300) was obtained by

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded and cultured in 96-well plates.
A CCK8 assay (Dojindo) was performed, and the optical
density (OD) at 450 nM was measured in an automatic
microplate reader (BioTek). Each experiment was
performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. The
data are presented as the average ±SD.

hazards regression model. The combination index (CI)
was calculated by CompuSyn software using the Chou
and Talalay method [25]. CI < 1, =1, and >1 represent
synergy, additivity, and antagonism, respectively. P
values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. Error bars represent the standard deviation
unless otherwise stated.

Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, washed twice
in PBS, and stained with annexin V/PE-7AAD (BD
Biosciences). Apoptosis was detected using a Cytomics
FC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). The percentage
of apoptotic cells was calculated using CXP Software.

Cell invasion assay

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Cells in serum-free medium (200 µl containing
3×104 cells) were added to upper Transwell chambers
(Corning) with an 8-mm pore size. The bottom chamber
contained medium with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant.
After a 24-hour incubation at 37 °C, the cells on the
upper surface of the membrane were removed with a
cotton swab. The cells on the lower surface were fixed in
ethanol and stained with 0.05% crystal violet. Cell motility
was quantified by counting the number of cells that had
migrated to the lower surface of the membrane. For each
membrane, five random fields were counted using a light
microscope at 100× magnification, and the mean value for
each membrane was calculated.

We thank Ping Wei, Lin Zhang, Midie Xu, Lei
Dong, and Weige Wang for their excellent technical
assistance.

Scratch wound-healing assay

This work was supported by the Shanghai Municipal
Science and Technique commission (Project No.
124119a4300, for Wentao Yang).

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of
15×105 cells/well and incubated overnight until they
reached 70% confluence. A pipette tip was used to generate
a scratch in the cell layer. Cells were then transfected with
shRNA (5 µg). Images were obtained at 0 and 72 hours at
the same position.

Clonogenic assay
Cells were seeded in 12-well plates and were
exposed to the indicated concentration of LMK-235 for
2 to 3 weeks. Media were replaced (with drugs added)
every 3 days. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
and stained with 0.05% crystal violet.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 10
statistical software. The cut off points for both mRNA
and protein were selected using the area under the timedependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve by MedCalc software [24]. Patients with BC were
divided into the low or high HDAC5 expression group
according to the cut-off point. Differences between
groups and correlations between HDAC5 expression
and the clinicopathological features of patients with BC
were evaluated by chi-squared tests, independent twosample t-tests and one-way ANOVA. Survival curves
were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method with
GraphPad Prism 5.0. Univariate and multivariate survival
analyses were performed using the Cox proportional
