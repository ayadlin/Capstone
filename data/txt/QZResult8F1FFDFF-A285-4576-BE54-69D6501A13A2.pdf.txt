Abstract
Inﬂammation-induced activation of proto-oncogenic NF-kB/REL and dysfunction of tumor suppressor TP53/
p63/p73 family transcription factors are key events in cancer progression. How inﬂammatory signaling
coordinates dysregulation of these two transcription factor families during oncogenesis remains incompletely
understood. Here, we observed that oncoprotein c-REL and tumor suppressor TAp73 are coexpressed and
complex with DNp63a in the nucleus of a subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines
with mutant (mt)TP53. TNF-a, a proinﬂammatory cytokine, promoted c-REL nuclear translocation, c-REL/
DNp63a interaction, and dissociation of TAp73 from DNp63a and the nucleus to the cytoplasm, whereas c-REL
siRNA knockdown attenuated this effect. Overexpression of c-REL or a c-REL kB-site DNA-binding mutant
enhanced protein interaction with DNp63a and TAp73 dissociation, implicating c-REL/DNp63a-speciﬁc interactions in these effects. We discovered that TNF-a or genetic alteration of c-REL expression inversely modulates
DNp63a/TAp73 interactions on distinct p63 DNA-binding sites, including those for key growth arrest and
apoptotic genes p21WAF1, NOXA, and PUMA. Functionally, c-REL repressed these genes and the antiproliferative
effects of TNF-a or TAp73. Conversely, c-REL siRNA depletion enhanced TAp73 promoter interaction and
expression of genes mediating growth arrest and apoptosis. Similar to TNF-a–treated HNSCC lines, human
HNSCC tumors and hyperplastic squamous epithelia of transgenic mice overexpressing DNp63a that exhibit
inﬂammation also show increased nuclear c-REL/DNp63a and cytoplasmic TAp73 localization. These ﬁndings
unveil a novel and reversible dynamic mechanism whereby proinﬂammatory cytokine TNF-a–induced c-REL/
DNp63a interactions inactivate tumor suppressor TAp73 function, promoting TNF-a resistance and cell survival
in cancers with mtTP53. Cancer Res; 71(21); 6867–77. 2011 AACR.

cell carcinomas (HNSCC; refs. 1, 2). The TP53 family also
includes p63 and p73, which have overlapping functions in
cell growth and apoptosis, as well as development of squamous
epithelia of the skin and mucosa (3, 4). When TP53 is mutated
or inactivated, transactivating (TA) isoforms TAp63 and TAp73
can potentially replace the tumor suppressor function of TP53.
TAp63 and TAp73 have full-length N-terminal domains which
share homology, transactivating, and tumor suppressor function with TP53. Although TAp63 and TAp73 are rarely mutated,
expression of alternatively transcribed DN isoforms can differentially affect their transactivation and tetramerization.
Recent evidence suggests that the DNp63a isoform is predominantly overexpressed together with TAp73 in major subsets of
HNSCC, breast, and other cancers (5). Nuclear interactions
between DNp63a and TAp73 proteins on regulatory promoters
have been implicated in repression of genes mediating growth
arrest and apoptosis (4, 5). However, what factor(s) regulate
these interactions between overexpressed DNp63a and TAp73,
and how their interaction leads to inactivation of TAp73 in
cancers with mtTP53, remains unclear.
Among candidate regulatory factors, TNF-a is a cytotoxic
cytokine which is expressed by cancer and inﬁltrating

inﬂammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment of many
cancers, including HNSCC (6, 7). Interestingly, we found that
HNSCC are paradoxically resistant to TNF-a–mediated growth
arrest and apoptosis, and that such resistance involves aberrant activation of NF-kB/REL transcription factors (8). Among
these, TNF-a has been shown to signal via a canonical pathway
to promote nuclear translocation and transactivation of RELA
(p65) and c-REL (9). RELA (p65) promotes expression of genes
that enhance cell proliferation and survival of cancers, including HNSCC (10–12). However, inhibition of RELA and these
prosurvival genes by siRNA in vitro or by proteasome inhibitor
in a phase I clinical trial in vivo showed limited cytotoxic and
clinical activity (11–13). Ampliﬁcation and nuclear localization
of c-REL has also been previously detected and found to be
relatively unaffected by proteasome inhibition in HNSCC (13,
14). These observations raised the question whether TNFa–regulated or overexpressed c-REL may contribute to inhibition of growth arrest and apoptosis of HNSCC by a distinct
mechanism.
We recently discovered that overexpressed DNp63a colocalizes and forms novel nuclear complexes with c-Rel in
murine keratinocytes or ortholog c-REL in human HNSCC
(15). Herein, we explored the hypothesis that TNF-a and c-REL
activation is linked to modulation of the aforementioned
DNp63a/TAp73 interactions and dysregulation of growth
arrest and apoptosis in cancer. We reveal a dynamic and
reversible mechanism whereby TNF-a promotes c-REL nuclear translocation and interaction with DNp63a, dissociation of
TAp73 from distinct p63 promoter sites of key growth arrest
and apoptotic genes, and TAp73 translocation to the cytoplasm. These results can help explain how inﬂammatory factor
TNF-a and c-REL, through DNp63a, inhibit the compensatory
ability of TAp73 to activate genes that mediate growth arrest
and apoptosis in HNSCC with mutant TP53.

Results

Cell lines
The characteristics, TP53 genotype, and culture of HNSCC
(UMSCC) cell lines obtained from the University of Michigan
were previously described (16, 17). UMSCC lines used herein
were obtained in 2008. Authentication was done at the University of Michigan by DNA genotyping of alleles for 9 loci,
D3S1358, D5S818, D7S820, D8S1179, D13S317, D18S51, D21S11,
FGA, vWA, and the amelogenin locus in 2008 and 2010, as
recently described (18). Cell line stocks were preserved at
80 C and cultured for fewer than 6 months before use.

Overexpression and protein interactions among c-REL,
DNp63a, and TAp73 in a subset of head and neck cancer
cell lines with mutant TP53
Expression of c-REL, p63, p73, and TP53 was characterized in
a panel of cell lines that included 9 HNSCC (UMSCC) and normal
primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK) (Supplementary Fig. S1). The UMSCC lines selected were derived from
primary and metastatic tumors exhibiting an aggressive clinical
course (survival <15 months) and representative genetic abnormalities, including inactivation or mutation of TP53 (16–18). cREL, DNp63a, TAp73, and TP53 protein were detected by
Western blots and qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1A–F). Total
c-REL protein was increased, as were nuclear c-REL and
DNp63a protein in most UMSCC, compared with normal HEK
(H) cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A, left, right panels). Interestingly, even greater c-REL expression was detected in 3 of 4 cell
lines (UMSCC-22B, -38, and -46) with elevated DNp63a, TAp73,
and mtTP53 (UMSCC-22A, -22B, -38, -46; Supplementary
Fig. S1A, left panel and Supplementary Fig. S1B–E). Thus, we
ﬁnd that c-REL, DNp63a, and TAp73 are overexpressed
with mtTP53 in an overlapping subset of HNSCC lines.

Western blot
Western blot analysis was done as previously (17). Primary
antibodies are listed in Supplementary Methods.
Real-time RT-PCR

TNF-a Induced c-REL Interacts with DNp63a and Inhibits TAp73 in HNSCC

panel). Moreover, TNF-a stimulation increased the interaction
between nuclear c-REL and DNp63a and a corresponding
dissociation of nuclear DNp63 and TAp73 in co-IP (Fig. 2B).
This dissociation corresponded with a decrease in TAp73 in the
nuclear fraction and appearance in the cytoplasmic fraction
(Fig. 2C). Conversely, c-REL knockdown by siRNA enhanced
DNp63a/TAp73 interaction without or with TNF-a (Fig. 2D).
Similar to TNF-a–induced c-REL, overexpressing c-RELFlag in UMSCC-22A resulted in increased interaction between
c-REL and DNp63a in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 3A, top panels).
Concurrently, TAp73 dissociated from DNp63a in the nuclear
fraction and appeared in the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 3A,
bottom panels). Further supporting that c-REL and TAp73
form alternative complexes with DNp63a, no signiﬁcant interaction between c-REL and TAp73 was detected in co-IP.
Overall, the above ﬁndings indicate that TNF-a–induced or
overexpressed c-REL is involved in the dissociation of TAp73
from DNp63a in the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
Previous studies have indicated that c-REL can bind kB
motifs bound by other NF-kB/REL members, as well as distinct
promoter sites and synthetic oligonucleotides (26). We compared the effect of overexpressing a wild-type (wt)c-REL and a
N-terminal RxxRxR to AxxAxA mutant reported to abrogate cREL binding to classical REL/kB DNA motifs (27). Overexpression and TNF-a enhanced nuclear translocation of exogenous
wt and AxxAxA mutant c-REL (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, both wt
and AxxAxA mutant c-REL reduced total nuclear TAp73 and
DNp63-TAp73 interaction, and this reduction was preferentially enhanced with TNF-a–stimulated AxxAxA mutant c-REL
(Fig. 3C and D). These results suggested that TNF-a–induced

Both c-REL and TAp73 exhibited basal interaction with
DNp63a in whole-cell extracts from 2 independent cell lines
by co-IP analysis (Fig. 1A; UMSCC-22A or -46). However, c-REL
and TAp73 exhibited weak or negligible interaction with one
another, seen only with supersensitive substrate and prolonged
exposure. Furthermore, c-REL, but not RELA(p65), interacted
with DNp63a (although RELA formed an independent complex
with c-REL; Fig. 1B), providing evidence for distinct interactions by these RELs. The complexes between c-REL, DNp63a,
and TAp73, identiﬁed in whole-cell extracts above, were found
in nuclear, but not cytoplasmic extracts (Fig. 1C). No interaction with mtTP53 was observed (Fig. 1B and C). In the absence
of further stimulation, a signiﬁcant portion of nuclear DNp63a
co-IPed with either c-REL or TAp73, when compared with
input (Fig. 1D).
TNF-a or genetic modulation of c-REL affects nuclear
localization and interactions between c-REL, DNp63, and
TAp73
The inﬂammatory cytokine TNF-a is a canonical inducer of
c-REL and is expressed in the HNSCC microenvironment in
vivo, but not by these cell lines in vitro (7, 25). We examined the
effect of exogenous TNF-a on the cellular distribution of c-REL,
DNp63a, and TAp73 in the UMSCC-22A cell line, which has
lower endogenous c-REL expression, making it amenable to
TNF-a or genetic modulation (Supplementary Fig. S1). TNF-a
stimulation increased nuclear localization of c-REL within
30 minutes (Fig. 2A, left panel). Remarkably, TNF-a not only
induced c-REL but also decreased TAp73, without signiﬁcantly
altering DNp63a expression in nuclear extracts (Fig. 2A, right

or overexpressed c-REL interacts with DNp63 and modulates
bound TAp73 in a manner distinct from those previously
shown to mediate c-REL binding to kB DNA recognition
sequences.
TNF-a or genetically modulated c-REL reciprocally
affects binding of TAp73 with DNp63a on p63 sites of
p21WAF1, NOXA, and PUMA gene promoters
To explore whether TNF-a modulates interactions between
c-REL, DNp63a, and TAp73 on p63/p73 regulatory sites, we
examined their binding to an oligonucleotide encoding a wellcharacterized p63/p73-binding site (2,283 to 2,273; Supplementary Fig. S2A) from the promoter of the p63/p73-regulated
growth arrest gene p21WAF1 (15, 23). Using this p63 sitespeciﬁc radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe, a major band was
revealed by EMSA in human UMSCC-22A cells (Fig. 4A, left

panel, MB). Binding speciﬁcity was conﬁrmed by unlabeled
probe competition, and the complex contained c-REL,
DNp63a, or TAp73, shown by supershift with speciﬁc antibodies. Similar to our ﬁndings in nuclear extracts, TNF-a
stimulated c-REL binding, while decreasing binding of TAp73,
without signiﬁcantly affecting DNp63a.
Next, we examined the endogenous binding of c-REL,
DNp63, and TAp73 to p21WAF1 promoter DNA using ChIP
assays. All 3 factors exhibited basal binding to the p63-binding
site region of the p21WAF1 promoter in UM-SCC 22A, -46, or
-1 cells (Fig. 4A, right panel; Supplementary Fig. S2B–D). TNF-a
induced c-REL binding and decreased TAp73 binding, without
signiﬁcantly affecting DNp63a binding to the p63 site in 2
different cell lines (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S2C). Similarly,
c-REL overexpression also induced the same effects in either
UMSCC-22A or -1 lines (Fig. 4A, right panel, Supplementary
Fig. S2D). Conversely, c-REL depletion by siRNA signiﬁcantly
decreased c-REL and DNp63 binding, and reciprocally
enhanced TAp73-binding activity in UM-SCC-22A cells (Supplementary Fig. S3E). Importantly, DNp63a siRNA knockdown
attenuated basal and TNF-a inducible binding of c-REL,
DNp63a, and TAp73, implicating DNp63a as a key anchor for
c-REL- and TAp73-binding activity (Fig. 4C). Together, these
ﬁndings in 3 different UMSCC lines indicate that TNF-a or
genetic modulation of c-REL results in reciprocal modulation
of TAp73 binding, with DNp63a on the established p63 regulatory site of the p21WAF1 promoter.
To examine the broader role of TNF-a–induced c-REL,
DNp63, and TAp73 interactions, we carried out ChIP assays
for p63-binding sites identiﬁed by bioinformatic analysis (28;
Supplementary Methods) on the promoters of 2 key proapoptotic genes, NOXA and PUMA (Supplementary Fig. S2A, arrows).
As with p21WAF1, stimulation with TNF-a increased c-REL
and decreased TAp73 binding without affecting DNp63 bound
to the predicted p63 sites in the PUMA and NOXA promoters
(Fig. 4D). No signiﬁcant binding by RELA(p65) or TP53 was
detected on the p63 promoter sites of any of these 3 genes
(Fig. 4A, right panel; D), consistent with co-IP results above.
Together, our results indicate that TNF-a or genetically modulated c-REL reciprocally affects binding of DNp63a with
TAp73 on p63 sites of multiple gene promoters.
c-REL differentially modulates p21WAF1, NOXA, and
PUMA gene expression in UMSCC cell lines differing in
expression of TP53 family members
We next examined how c-REL-modulated DNp63a-TAp73
interactions affect expression of growth arrest mediator
p21WAF1. The UM-SCC cell subsets express lower or higher
baseline levels p21WAF1 mRNA and protein (Supplementary
Fig. S3A and B), similar to relative differences in expression of
wt or mt TP53, DNp63a, and TAp73 shown above (Supplementary Fig. S1A–D). Knockdown of endogenous c-REL by
siRNA signiﬁcantly reduced levels of c-REL mRNA in 2 cell
lines, UMSCC-1 and UMSCC-22A (Fig. 5A, left panel), from
those subsets that differ in baseline expression of p21WAF1
and TP53 family proteins. However, c-REL depletion in
UMSCC-22A cells with abundant mtTP53, DNp63, and TAp73
resulted in a strong increase in p21WAF1 mRNA and protein

levels, when compared with UMSCC-1 cells lacking wtTP53
and TAp73 (Fig. 5A, right panel; Fig. 5B, left panel). Conversely,
overexpression of c-REL by transient transfection repressed
p21WAF1 expression in UMSCC-22A cells, but not in UMSCC-1
cells (Fig. 5B, right panel). Similarly, TNF-a induced nuclear cREL, although inhibiting expression of TAp73 target protein
p21WAF1 (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Increased p21WAF1
expression after c-REL depletion in UMSCC-22A was attenuated by cotransfection with TAp73 siRNA (Supplementary
Fig. S3D), indicating the contribution of TAp73. Transfection
of TAp73-deﬁcient UMSCC-1 cells with TAp73 increased,
whereas cotransfection with c-REL suppressed an increase in
p21WAF1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S3E). Depletion of cREL by siRNA also enhanced PUMA and NOXA expression in
the mtTP53 cell line UMSCC-22A, but not in UMSCC-1 cells
deﬁcient in TP53 and TAp73 (Fig. 5C). Together, these results
indicate that c-REL represses 3 important growth arrest and
proapoptotic genes in HNSCC expressing DNp63 and TAp73
with mtTP53.
c-REL promotes cellular proliferation and survival in
UMSCC cells expressing DNp63, TAp73 with mtTP53
We further examined the function of c-REL in proliferation
and survival of HNSCC cells in vitro. c-REL depletion with siRNA
had no signiﬁcant effect on proliferation of UMSCC-1 cells that
express lower levels of wtTP53 and other family members, but

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibited proliferation and density of UMSCC-22A cells that
exhibit high protein levels of DNp63a, TAp73 and mtTP53 and
inducible p21WAF1 (Fig. 6A and B; Supplementary Fig. S4A). cREL siRNA depletion also increased sub-G0 DNA-positive dead
cells in UMSCC-22A, but not in UMSCC-1 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4B), whereas c-REL overexpression reduced the sub-G0
fraction in UMSCC-22A cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C). The
results showing that c-REL promotes cell proliferation and
survival are consistent with the effect of c-REL in repressing
p21WAF1, NOXA, and PUMA gene expression (Fig. 5), which
mediate growth arrest and apoptosis in HNSCC (29).

function of TAp73, UMSCC-1 lacking TAp73 was transfected
with control vector, c-REL, TAp73, or a combination of c-REL
and TAp73. c-REL enhanced and TAp73 inhibited proliferation,
whereas cotransfection of c-REL with TAp73 abrogated the
inhibitory function of TAp73 (Fig. 6C). As HNSCC are relatively
resistant to TNF-a–mediated inhibition of growth and survival
(8), we examined the functional effect of TNF-a treatment or cREL transfection, alone or in combination, on UM-SCC-22A
cells (Fig. 6D). TNF-a alone weakly inhibited and c-REL
enhanced proliferation, but the combination of TNF-a and
c-REL overexpression further enhanced proliferation. Together, these data support the role of endogenous or exogenously
overexpressed c-REL in repressing the antiproliferative function of TNF-a and TAp73.

Human HNSCC tumors displayed increased (2þ to 3þ) nuclear

greater nuclear c-REL and cytoplasmic TAp73 were detected in
HNSCC tumors than in unstimulated UMSCC cultured in vitro
(Supplementary Fig. S1A), consistent with overexpression of
inﬂammatory factors such as TNFa, previously shown in the
HNSCC tumor environment (7).
We also examined a recently developed transgenic mouse

under a tet-K5 promoter results in inﬂammation, overexpression of TNF-a, other proinﬂammatory cytokines, and squamous hyperplasia (28, 30, J. Du and Z. Chen, unpublished data).

increased suprabasilar nuclear c-Rel and DNp63a, and both
cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for TAp73 in squamous
epithelia (Fig. 7B). Thus, overexpression of DNp63a results in
suprabasilar enhancement of nuclear c-REL and DNp63a, and
cytoplasmic/nuclear distribution of TAp73, similar to that of
orthologous proteins throughout malignant human squamous
epithelia.

Discussion
Here we unveil evidence for a new paradigm (Fig. 7C),
whereby an inﬂammatory factor, TNF-a, can promote nuclear
interaction of c-REL with DNp63a, and TAp73 translocation to
the cytoplasm, inhibiting the compensatory ability of TAp73 to
activate key genes that mediate growth arrest and apoptosis in
HNSCC with mutant TP53. Our ﬁndings establish a novel link

between TNF-a expression and resistance (6–8, 10), nuclear
activation of proto-oncogene c-REL (13–15), and dysregulation
of p63/p73 family transcription factors (4, 5, 23, 28, 29), which
have been independently implicated in cancer progression.
TNF-a–induced c-REL/DNp63a interactions and TAp73 dissociation were shown at unique p63 DNA regulatory sites
within the promoters of important growth arrest and proapoptotic genes. The role of TNF-a induced c-REL in these
speciﬁc interactions with DNp63a/TAp73 did not seem to
involve RELA, nor c-REL transactivation domain residues
involved in binding to kB enhancers shared with other NFkB/REL family members. These ﬁndings suggest that TNFa–induced c-REL has a distinct function in inactivating TAp73
in p63/p73 promoter-regulated proapoptotic gene expression,
complementing that previously shown for RELA in promoting
kB-regulated prosurvival genes important in the malignant

phenotype (10, 31). Furthermore, our ﬁndings suggest that
targeting TNF-a signaling, c-REL, or other regulators of these
c-REL–DNp63a–TAp73 interactions could enhance TAp73
function, potentially helping in prevention or treatment of
cancers with altered TP53 status.
A novel ﬁnding of this study is the demonstration of the role
of TNF-a in coordinating interactions between nuclear c-REL/
DNp63a and reciprocal dissociation of DNp63a/TAp73 complexes, linking these previously reported components and
interactions into a common dynamic mechanism. Previously,
we discovered nuclear interactions between murine c-Rel and
overexpressed DNp63a in keratinocytes and human c-REL and
DNp63a in HNSCC (15). In murine keratinocytes, c-Rel and
DNp63a were shown to prevent growth arrest, suggesting that
corresponding c-REL/DNp63a complexes in HNSCC may also
contribute to loss of growth control and promote the malignant phenotype. Independently, overexpressed DNp63a was
shown to interact with TAp73 and promote survival in HNSCC
(29). However, the relationship between these components,
factor(s) modulating them, and basis for TAp73 inactivation
were unknown. Here, we found that either c-REL or TAp73
interact with DNp63a, but we detected minimal interaction
between c-REL and TAp73, suggesting that c-REL or TAp73
alternately complex with DNp63a. Supporting this model, we
further established that TNF-a dynamically promotes nuclear
c-REL/DNp63a interaction and reciprocal dissociation of
DNp63a/TAp73. This is accompanied by nuclear–cytoplasmic
translocation of TAp73, thus providing a basis for the inactivation of TAp73. TNF-a–induced c-REL was an important

component of this mechanism, as c-REL siRNA attenuated
dissociation of DNp63a/TAp73, although c-REL overexpression had a similar promoting effect on the dissociation and
cytoplasmic translocation of TAp73. These effects of TNF-a or
c-REL in promoting increased nuclear c-REL/DNp63a and
cytoplasmic TAp73 in a subset of HNSCC lines may help
explain the similar distribution we observed in HNSCC tumors,
in which increased TNF-a expression as well as ampliﬁcation
and nuclear localization of c-REL have been detected (7, 13, 14).
These dynamic nuclear c-REL–DNp6a–TAp73 interactions,
modulated by TNF-a or c-REL, were mirrored on established
and novel predicted p63 regulatory sites in the promoters of
several growth arrest and apoptotic genes. EMSA results
indicated TNF-a induces reciprocal modulation between cREL or TAp73 in binding to an established p63 site sequence of
the p21WAF1 promoter (15, 23). DNp63a binding remained
relatively unchanged by TNF-a, but DNp63a knockdown
inhibited ChIP binding of both c-REL and TAp73 to the
p21WAF1 promoter, indicating that DNp63a bound to this
p63 site is a key anchor for c-REL and TAp73 transcription
factors. Although NOXA and PUMA were also previously identiﬁed as p63/p73 target genes (29), speciﬁc binding sites for
p63/p73 were not previously resolved. Using a bioinformatics
approach, we predicted p63-binding sites in these genes. We
observed similar speciﬁcity in binding and modulation by TNFa of c-REL and TAp73 cobound with DNp63a on p21WAF1,
NOXA, and PUMA promoters by ChIP assay. We have recently
shown the capability of TNF-a to modulate c-REL/DNp63a
interaction on p63 sites of additional genes by ChIP and EMSA

(28) and obtained further evidence for the speciﬁcity of c-REL
in interacting with DNp63a at p63 regulatory sites. Preliminary
ChIP sequencing results indicate that c-REL, p63, and/or p73
factors bind at many additional loci (H. Lu, unpublished data).
Together, these ﬁndings suggest that the dynamic modulation
of nuclear interactions involving these transcription factors
observed in co-IP analysis are likely related to their speciﬁc
interactions on p63/p73 sites of multiple gene promoters.
Our results further revealed the important and reversible
function of nuclear c-REL in attenuating the compensatory
ability of TAp73 to promote expression of these key growth
arrest and apoptotic genes. Knockdown of c-REL potentiated
the expression of p21WAF1, NOXA, and PUMA, further supporting the biological and potential therapeutic relevance of cREL–DNp63a–TAp73 interactions observed on their promoters. Moreover, the modulation of these growth arrest and
apoptotic genes was speciﬁcally observed in UMSCC-22A from
a subset overexpressing TAp73 and DNp63a with mtTP53. This
effect was not seen in UMSCC-1 from a subset with attenuation

of expression and function of both TAp73 and wtTP53, which
we have shown can result from other therapeutically reversible
mechanisms (17, 32). Consistent with these ﬁndings, c-REL
modulation affected proliferation and apoptosis in UMSCC22A but not UMSCC-1. Conversely, overexpressed c-REL inhibited the expression of p21WAF1 and antiproliferative effects
when TAp73 was reexpressed in TAp73-deﬁcient UMSCC-1,
supporting an important role for c-REL in inhibiting the
compensatory ability of TAp73. Together, these results highlight the functional importance and potentially reversible
nature of c-REL–mediated inhibition of TAp73 function in
HNSCC overexpressing TAp73, DNp63a, and mtTP53.
Our ﬁndings in UMSCC lines are likely to be of broader
relevance in HNSCC and other cancers. Increased nuclear cREL/DNp63a and nuclear and cytoplasmic TAp73 was
observed in a majority of HNSCC tumor specimens. Similarly,
increased DNp63a and TAp73 was previously seen in an
independent panel of HNSCC tumors and lines and linked
with inactivation of TAp73 (5, 29). Breast cancer specimens

also show increased DNp63 and TAp73 immunostaining, and
this is most often seen in specimens with mtTP53 status (33).
Subsets exhibiting increased expression of DNp63 in HNSCC
and breast cancer have also been reported to be more sensitive
to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin (33, 34), underscoring the
potential clinical relevance of identifying and selecting agents
active in these tumor subsets.
Inﬂammatory mediator TNF-a is identiﬁed as a key
modulator of dynamic interactions of c-REL with DNp63a
and inactivation of TAp73. This mechanism could therefore
contribute to the acquired resistance and promoting effects
of TNF-a produced by inﬂammatory cells during tumorigenesis and metastatic tumor progression of HNSCC and
other cancers (6–8, 10). Supporting this hypothesis, we show
here that combining TNF-a with overexpression of c-REL
not only negated the inhibitory effect of TNF-a but also
enhanced proliferation over that observed with either alone.
Furthermore, human HNSCC tumors and epithelia of K5DNp63a transgenic mice that exhibit increased TNF-a
expression, inﬂammation, and epithelial proliferation
(7, 28, J. Du and Z. Chen, unpublished observations) showed
greater nuclear c-REL/DNp63a and distribution of TAp73
between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Previous ﬁndings
support targeting TNF-a or the canonical signal pathway
which activates c-REL, for prevention or therapy of SCC.
Knockout of TNF-a or TNF receptor-1, or TNF-a inhibitors,
have been shown to reduce chemical carcinogenesis and
malignant progression of SCC of the skin and other epithelial
cancers (6). We previously showed that blocking canonical
pathway signaling increased TNF-a cytotoxicity in HNSCC
in vitro and induced apoptosis and regression of established
murine and human SCC in vivo (8). However, early-phase
clinical trials with TNF-a or proteasome inhibitors, which
inhibit canonical pathway activation, have shown limited

potential to slow disease progression in patients with
advanced cancers (6, 13).
Consequently, other molecular requirements for coordinated
modulation of c-REL, DNp63a, and TAp73 interactions on the
promoters of target genes merit investigation as targets for
therapy. Unique structural characteristics of c-REL have previously been implicated in TNF-a–induced, TBK and IKKepsilon
phosphorylation, dimerization, DNA binding, or transactivation
(35, 36). One of our laboratories found that the DNp63 a-domain,
critical for oligomerization (5), is necessary for interaction with
c-Rel (15). Cisplatin-induced IKKa and b activation have been
reported to promote degradation of DNp63a and stabilization
of p73, suggesting DNA damaging agents, and these kinases
may be important modulators of these important components
of the mechanism described herein (37, 38).
