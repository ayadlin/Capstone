BACKGROUND: The role of low doses of cisplatin and concomitant postoperative radiotherapy in high risk
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has not yet been defined. METHODS: Patients treated with definitive surgery, who had histological evidence of involvement of more than 2 lymph nodes, extracapsular
extension of disease, perineural and/or intravascular invasion, involved or close surgical margins, received
postoperative radiotherapy plus 75 mg/m2 of cisplatin every 3 weeks during the radiotherapy cycle. The
primary endpoints were to evaluate treatment compliance and overall, cause-specific, and disease-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were enrolled. With a median follow-up of 40 months, 5-year overall
survival was 68%, cause-specific survival 78% and disease-free survival 82%. At multivariate analysis
surgical margins status and extracapsular lymph node invasion were the only statistically significant
prognostic factors. Fifty-three percent of the patients developed severe mucositis and 14% hematologic
toxicity of grade 3. The 3 planned concomitant chemotherapy cycles were delivered to 48% of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative radiotherapy and concomitant low-dose cisplatin was an effective treatment
in high risk head and neck patients. The total toxicity observed was lower compared with that reported
with higher doses of cisplatin, although the delivery of all the 3 planned chemotherapy cycles was challenging. The distant failure rate was high, which was an unsatisfactory result. Cancer 2009;115:2464–71.

Postoperative Radiochemotherapy in H&N Patients/Franchin et al

Two randomized trials demonstrated that
concomitant cisplatin-based chemotherapy with radiotherapy was able to improve locoregional control, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS)
compared with radiotherapy alone in selected patients
at high risk of local and distant recurrence.1,2 The
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9501
trial enrolled patients with high-risk characteristics
such as histological evidence of 2 or more regional
metastasis to lymph nodes, extracapsular extension of
lymph node disease, and microscopically involved mucosal margins of resection. The EORTC trial studied
patients with T3 to T4 squamous cell carcinoma, N2
to N3 lymph node stage, and patients with stage T1
to T2 and N1 to N2 who had unfavorable pathologic
findings such as extra–lymph node spread, positive
resection margins, perineural involvement, or vascular
tumor embolism. Both studies used the same chemotherapy schedule consisting of 100 mg of cisplatin per
square meter of body-surface area on Days 1, 22, and
43 of the radiotherapy course (60-66 Gy over a
period of 6-12 weeks). Despite the excellent results in
locoregional control of disease, some severe adverse
effects in the chemoradiation arm were documented.
The American study reported a 77% incidence of
acute adverse effects of grade 3 or greater in the combined modality treatment; 4 patients (2%) died as a
direct consequence of the treatment. Only 61% of the
patients received all of the 3 planned cycles of cisplatin. The European trial reported severe (grade 3 or
higher) adverse effects in 41% of patients who underwent chemoradiation. Seventy-four percent of patients
received all 3 cycles; the third cycle was administered
on time and without delay in 49% of patients. The
high degree of toxicity in the EORTC study2 did
compromise the delivery of the planned treatment,
with only half of the patients receiving the third cycle
of chemotherapy concomitant with radiation. This fact
might have reduced the rate of local control of
disease.
To improve the compliance with the chemoradiotherapy treatment and to lower the high frequency of
acute side effects, in the present prospective phase 2 trial,
we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of reduced doses of
cisplatin administered concomitantly with radiation therapy in the postoperative setting in a series of consecutive
patients with locally advanced head and neck carcinoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between January 1998 and August 2007, consecutive
patients affected by head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who underwent radical surgical resection at the Head & Neck Surgical DepartmentPordenone General Hospital / CRO-Aviano, were
enrolled in this phase 2 study. Both the approval from our
institutional review board and written informed consent
from the patients were obtained. The patients that were
included in this study had not been considered eligible, at
the time of surgery, for a larynx preservation treatment by
the Head and Neck Tumor Board of our institution.
Eligibility criteria for the study included previous
macroscopically radical surgery, and presence of at least 1
of the following unfavorable pathologic findings: metastasis to 2 or more regional lymph nodes, extracapsular
tumor spread, perineural or intravascular invasion,
involved or close (5 mm) resection margins. Patients
had to tolerate chemotherapy as defined by a maximum
age of 75 years, a Karnofsky performance status of at least
70, a white cell count of at least 4000/mm3, a platelet
count of at least 120,000/mm3, and a creatinine clearance
of at least 65 mL/minute. Patients previously treated with
radiotherapy or chemotherapy were excluded from the
study.
At the first visit, a complete medical history and an
accurate clinical examination were obtained, including a
head and neck status description, blood count, renal
chemistry parameter, liver function tests, dental evaluation, and chest CT scan.
Surgery consisted of a radical resection of the tumor
with macroscopically adequate margins. Margins were
always evaluated with frozen sections, and additional tissue samples were obtained during surgery. In case of intraoperative evidence of infiltrated or close margins, the
resection was enlarged until histological evidence of
tumor-negative margins could be demonstrated. The surgical approach varied according to the site of primary tumor
(oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx) and
encompassed an en bloc neck dissection: selective, modified
radical, or radical, depending on clinical assessment of the
neck lymph nodes. Bilateral neck dissections were performed for median or close to the midline tumors.
Histological typing and grading were based on the
World Health Organization classification.3 The most

aggressive area (medium magnification field) was graded as
well differentiated, moderately differentiated, or poorly differentiated. Type and intensity of inflammatory infiltrate,
desmoplastic stromal response, mitotic count (10 HPF
[high-power field] at 40), and presence of vascular and/or
perineural peritumoral invasion were also recorded. The distance from invasive carcinoma to surgical margins (in millimeters) was histologically evaluated for both mucosal and
deep margins and categorized as clear (distance >5 mm),
close (1-5 mm), or involved (<1 mm).
The radiotherapy treatment started as soon as possible,
but not before 3 weeks and no later than 8 weeks after surgery. The postoperative radiotherapy schedule consisted of a
total dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions over a 6.5-week period.
Radiotherapy was delivered with a 6 MV Linear Accelerator
using a shrinking-field technique as previously described4 or
a 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy technique.
Concomitant chemotherapy consisted of 3 courses of
cisplatin 75 mg/m2, infused on Days 1, 22, and 43, concomitantly with the course of radiotherapy. Administration
of chemotherapy after the completion of radiation was not
allowed by the protocol. The placement of a percutaneous
endoscopy gastrostomy tube was planned in patients with a
weight loss of 10% or more during the treatment period.
During the course of treatment, clinical examination, blood
count, and renal function tests were taken weekly. Acute
and late toxicity were reported according to the RTOG criteria.5 At the end of treatment, patients were evaluated every
2 months for the first 12 months, every 3 months for the following 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter.
The purposes of our study were to determine the
compliance with the treatment and the adverse effects of
therapy, as well as to determine DFS, CSS, and OS. OS,
CSS, and DFS were assessed from the day of surgery, by
the Kaplan-Meier method; log-rank test was used to test
for differences between groups. Univariate and multivariate DFS analysis were performed using Cox proportional
hazards model (HR) with 95% confidence intervals.
Variables with P  .08 at the univariate analysis
were tested in the multivariate analysis. Results were considered statistically significant when P  .05.

RESULTS
In the study period, 142 consecutive patients were
enrolled. The majority of the patients were male (78.2%)
2466

and were younger than 60 years of age (55.6%). Patients
presented a squamous cell carcinoma arising in the oropharynx (42%), oral cavity (32%), larynx/hypopharynx
(17%), and cervical lymph node metastases from
unknown primary carcinoma (14%). Twenty-four (17%)
patients had stage II and III HNSCC, 118 (83%) patients
had stage IVA and IVB. Patient and tumor characteristics
are reported in Table 1.
The median time from surgery to start of chemoradiation was 7 weeks. All patients but 3 completed the
planned radiotherapy without delay, with a median treatment time of 47 days. The specified chemotherapy was
delivered to 68 patients (48%) with 63 patients (45%)
receiving 2 cycles, and 11 (7%) only 1 cycle of chemotherapy. The median total dose of cisplatin administered was
390 mg. The toxicity from the treatment is summarized
in Table 2. The most common acute adverse effect was
mucositis, which was of grade 3 and 4 in 53% and 12% of
patients, respectively. Hematologic toxicity of grade 3 was
observed in only 14% of patients. With regard to late toxicity, xerostomia was the only significant adverse effect,
which was of grade 3 in 9.5% of patients.
After a median follow-up of 36 months, 5-year OS,
cause-specific survival (CSS; Fig. 1), and DFS were 68%,
78%, and 82%, respectively
Twenty-five (17.6%) patients experienced locoregional or distant failure. The most frequent pattern of
relapse was distant: 17 of 25 patients experienced distant
metastasis as first site of recurrence, whereas 8 experienced
a locoregional relapse (P ¼ .02). The median time to
relapse was 7 months after the end of the radiation course.
At univariate analysis, N stage (P ¼ .04), extracapsular extension (P ¼ .01), positive surgical margins (P ¼
.08), and intensity of inflammatory infiltrate (P ¼ .07)
were the most significant variables predicting DFS. At
multivariate analysis, only status of surgical margins (P ¼
.003; HR 7.56; range, 1.8-31) and extracapsular lymph
node extension (P ¼ .009; HR 5.9; range, 1.55-22.4)
were predictors of DFS. Five-year DFS was 63% for
patients who had histologically proven positive margins,
77% for patients with close (5 mm) margins, and 82%
for patients with a negative surgical margin status, respectively. Five-year DFS was 72% and 91% for patients with
and without extracapsular extension of lymph node disease, respectively. Sex, age, tumor site, T stage, Union

DISCUSSION
Two large randomized trials established a new standard of
care for adjuvant therapy for patients with high-risk
HNSCC, consisting in the concurrent postoperative
administration of 100 mg/m2 of cisplatin and radiotherapy. These 2 randomized trials yielded satisfactory results
2468

in terms of locoregional control and disease-free survival;
the European trial showed also a significant improvement
in OS. On the other hand, both studies reported a significant higher frequency of severe adverse effects in the combined modality arms in comparison with the
radiotherapy-alone arms. Four patients (2%) who
received combined therapy died as direct result of treatment in the RTOG study.
In this study, we investigated whether the administration of a reduced dose of cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, given
concomitantly with radiation in the postoperative setting
in patients with high-risk HNSCC, would reduce the
severe adverse effects associated with the chemotherapy
regimen without compromising the overall outcome. We
observed a lower incidence of severe hematologic toxicity,
in comparison with the results of the RTOG and EORTC
trials. We recorded a grade 2 to 3 hematologic toxicity in
33% of our patients, whereas the EORTC trial and the
RTOG trial reported severe adverse effects in 16% and

patients with head and neck cancer.

77% of patients, respectively. In our study, no patient
died from treatment-related toxicity. Conversely, we
failed to reduce the frequency of severe mucositis, which
was 65% in our study. This result is comparable to the
results of the RTOG and EORTC trials.
In our study, such a high rate of acute mucositis
resulted in a low compliance to chemotherapy. It needs to
be emphasized that as many as 45% of the patients in our
study were older than 60 years of age and that our population consisted mostly of heavy alcohol consumers.
Only 48% of our patients received all of the 3 cycles
of cisplatin concomitantly with radiation: so no comparison can be made on this point with the EORTC and
RTOG studies, in which the protocols allowed administration of the third cycle of chemotherapy also after the
end of the radiation treatment.
By reducing the dose of cisplatin, we were able to
reduce the upper gastrointestinal side effects. No grade
3 to 4 nausea and emesis were reported in our study.
The most severe acute and delayed emesis seen with 100
mg/m2 of cisplatin may make it difficult for many patients
to comply with the chemotherapy itself and with oral
medications. Grade 3 to 4 nausea and vomiting reported
by the RTOG and EORTC trials were 40% and 25%,
respectively.
Porceddu et al reported the results of the administration of 40 mg/m2 weekly cisplatin concurrent with adjuvant radiation therapy in 47 patients with high-risk
HNSCC.6 The authors reported a grade 3 to 4 hematoCancer

June 1, 2009

logic toxicity in 17% of patients, and 9% of febrile neutropenia. Nineteen patients (40%) developed confluent
mucositis. The estimated 2-year OS and DFS rate were
71% and 64%, respectively.
The frequency of distant metastases was comparable
in the combined and in the radiotherapy-alone groups.1,2
This finding supports the hypothesis that concurrent
chemotherapy does not exert its principal beneficial effect
by preventing distant metastases but most likely by
enhancing the effect of radiotherapy. Although a reduced
dose of cisplatin was administered, we achieved excellent
results in terms of locoregional control and DFS. We
reported a 5-year DFS of 82%, which appears to be higher
than that reported by the EORTC and RTOG trials. The
European and the American trials reported a 3-year DFS
of 59% and approximately 50%, respectively. Even with a
low dose of cisplatin, the most prevalent pattern of relapse
was distant (P ¼ .02) and did not result in a compromise
of locoregional control. This finding confirms that a dose
of 75 mg/m2 of cisplatin is adequate to enhance the effect
of radiation on locoregional control of disease.
In a group of patients treated postoperatively in the
Yale Mitomycin Randomized Trial,7 a statistically significant benefit in terms of 5-year CSS (74% vs 51%) and
locoregional recurrence-free survival was reported for the
radiochemotherapy arm, but the large number of non–
cancer-related deaths in the chemotherapy arm resulted in
difficulty in assessing a statistical difference.
Al-Sarraf et al,8 in a study on 51 patients treated
postoperatively with radiotherapy and concomitant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (100 mg/m2 every 21 days),
reported an overall severe toxicity of 32%, with life-threatening toxicity in 12% of the patients. At any rate, 48% of
the patients were alive at 3 years with a satisfactory locoregional control rate of 81%.
A French study9 randomized high-risk postoperative
patients to radiotherapy alone versus radiotherapy plus
weekly cisplatin, 50-mg total dose. Severe late toxicity
(hypopharyngeal stenosis, severe subcutaneous fibrosis,
mandibular radionecrosis) were observed in 22% of the
chemoradiotherapy group, although acute toxicity was
not reported. The 5-year OS and CSS were 36% and 47%
respectively, and 5-year survival without locoregional
recurrence was 70%.
Efforts to reduce treatment toxicity were reported
using carboplatin instead of cisplatin. The results of 2
2469

Original Article

phase 3 randomized trial of postoperative radiotherapy
with or without carboplatin in high-risk patients have
been recently reported. In the Pittsburgh study,10 72 radically resected patients with high-risk pathologic features
were randomized to receive either postoperative radiotherapy alone or plus carboplatin (100 mg/m2) once a
week. At a median follow-up of 64 months, there were no
statistically significant differences in 5-year DFS and OS
between the treatment arms. The carboplatin plus radiotherapy treatment was well tolerated, and there was no
increase of severe toxicities. Adverse effects of grade 3 were
reported in 18% of patients in the radiotherapy arm versus 36% in the combined treatment arm. Gastrostomy
tube feeding was required in 15 patients. The results of
the study showed no advantage in combining carboplatin
with radiotherapy over radiotherapy alone.
A similar study11 enrolled patients undergoing
surgery for head and neck cancers and with histological
evidence of lymph node involvement. Patients were
randomized to receive either radiotherapy alone or plus
concomitant carboplatin (50 mg/m2) twice weekly.
One hundred forty-four patients were evaluable. Similar to the Pittsburgh study, and at a median follow-up
of 106 months, the study did not demonstrate any
advantage in 2-year locoregional recurrence and 2-year
OS rates with the addition of carboplatin to radiotherapy. With regard to toxicity, 1 patient in the combined treatment group died of pneumonia following
bone marrow aplasia. No severe late toxicities were
reported. The authors concluded that the combined
regimen cannot be recommended.
The rates of OS, CSS, and DFS obtained in our
study are among the highest ever reported in published
studies. This fact may be explained by the good outcome of surgery in our population. From our experience, an adequate surgery appears to be of crucial
importance in determining the overall outcome of
patient care. The majority of patients of the present series underwent radical surgery with negative (51%) or
close (42%) resection margins; only 9% had positive
margins. It should be pointed out that patients surgically treated during the same period but without
pathologically proven unfavorable prognostic factors
are not included in this series. The importance of surgical margin status is also confirmed by the multivariate analysis showing that only extracapsular lymph
2470

node extension and surgical margin status were predictors of survival in our patients. Furthermore, the negative impact of the close margins was possibly improved
by the adjuvant treatment, resulting in a survival rate
without any statistically significant difference between
close or negative margins.
In conclusion, a reduced dose of cisplatin of
75 mg/m2 administered concomitantly with radiotherapy
in the adjuvant setting is safe and may benefit high-risk
HNSCC. However, even a reduced dose of cisplatin
administered concomitantly with radiation after an
aggressive surgery brings about a significant mucosal toxicity. The treatment does not appear to affect the incidence of distant recurrences
