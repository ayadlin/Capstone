ABSTRACT
Targeted radioiodine therapy for thyroid cancer is based on selective stimulation
of Na+/ I- Symporter (NIS)-mediated radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) in thyroid
cells by thyrotropin. Patients with advanced thyroid cancer do not benefit from
radioiodine therapy due to reduced or absent NIS expression. To identify inhibitors
that can be readily translated into clinical care, we examined oncological pipeline
inhibitors targeting Akt, MEK, PI3K, Hsp90 or BRAF in their ability to increase RAIU
in thyroid cells expressing BRAFV600E or RET/PTC3 oncogene. Our data showed that
(1) PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 outperformed other inhibitors in RAIU increase mainly
by decreasing iodide efflux rate to a great extent; (2) RAIU increase by all inhibitors
was extensively reduced by TGF-β, a cytokine secreted in the invasive fronts of thyroid
cancers; (3) RAIU reduction by TGF-β was mainly mediated by NIS reduction and
could be reversed by Apigenin, a plant-derived flavonoid; and (4) In the presence
of TGF-β, GDC-0941 with Apigenin co-treatment had the highest RAIU level in both
BRAFV600E expressing cells and RET/PTC3 expressing cells. Taken together, Apigenin
may serve as a dietary supplement along with small molecule inhibitors to improve
radioiodine therapeutic efficacy on invasive tumor margins thereby minimizing future
metastatic events.

has been focused on identifying molecular mechanisms
and reagents that could further increase TSH-stimulated
thyroidal RAIU.
The BRAFV600E oncogene is the most common
mutation found in thyroid cancer followed by the RET/
PTC rearrangements [2]. MEK/ERK pathway is a
canonical downstream effector of BRAFV600E while both
MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways are well-accepted
downstream arms of the activated tyrosine kinases
resulting from RET/PTC rearrangements. Hsp90 is
a chaperone that stabilizes client proteins including
BRAFV600E [3, 4] and RET/PTC [5] and maintains MEK
and Akt signaling pathways [4, 6]. Pharmacological

INTRODUCTION
Thyroid cancer incidence is rapidly increasing in the
Unites States [1]. For thyroid cancer of poor prognosis,
radioactive iodide (RAI) is administered for remnant
ablation, and/or for targeted therapy of residual, recurrent,
or metastatic cancer after total thyroidectomy. Targeted
RAI therapy is facilitated by selective stimulation of Na+/
I- Symporter (NIS; SLC5A5)-mediated iodide uptake by
thyrotropin (TSH) in thyroid cells. However, patients with
refractory or advanced thyroid cancer could not benefit
from RAI targeted therapy due to absent or insufficient
TSH-stimulated RAI uptake (RAIU). Hence, much effort

inhibitors targeting BRAF/MEK [7, 8], PI3K/Akt
[8–10] or Hsp90 [5] selectively increase RAIU in
thyroid cell cultures and their modes of action have been
summarized [11]. The effects of inhibitors for BRAF/
MEK [12] and Hsp90 [13] to increase RAIU have been
validated in mouse models of thyroid cancer. Recently,
a MEK inhibitor AZD6244 and a BRAFV600E inhibitor
GSK2118436 were reported to further increase thyroidal
RAI accumulation to an extent that may lead to clinical
benefit in RAI-refractory patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial
[14] and in a pilot study [15] respectively.
To identify inhibitors that can be readily translated
into clinical care, we investigated and compared several
small molecule inhibitors (abbreviated as ‘i’) in oncological
pipelines targeting Akt, MEK, PI3K, Hsp90 or BRAF in their
ability to further increase TSH-stimulated RAIU in thyroid
cells. None of the established human thyroid cell lines
maintain TSH-stimulated NIS expression and RAIU. Thus,
we chose PCCl3 rat thyroid cells that remain responsive to
TSH in increasing NIS expression and RAIU for this study.
To mimic thyroid tumors expressing BRAFV600E or RET/
PTC3 oncogenes, we examined PCCl3 cells with inducible
expression of BRAFV600E or RET/PTC3. TGF-β is a cytokine
found in tumor microenvironment that has been shown to
decrease NIS expression and thus RAIU at the invasive
fronts of thyroid cancers [16–20]. We investigated if the
effect of small molecule inhibitors on TSH-stimulated RAIU
is compromised by TGF-β. Finally, we also examined the
effect of Apigenin, a plant-based flavonoid, as a combination
treatment with selected inhibitors as we previously reported
that Apigenin further increased Akt inhibitor-induced
RAIU [21].

reagents for additional 24 hours. Reagents used in this
study are listed as follows: MK-2206 (Akt1/2/3 inhibitor;
Akti), GSK1120212, AZD6244 (MEK inhibitors;
MEKi), GDC-0941, BKM-120 (PI3K inhibitors; PI3Ki),
AUY-922 (Hsp90 inhibitor; Hsp90i), GSK2118436,
PLX-4032 (BRAFV600E inhibitors; BRAFi) (Selleck
Chemicals, Houston, TX), STA-9090 (Hsp90i) (Synta
Pharmaceuticals Corp., Lexington, MA), Apigenin,
DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and TGF-β
(Peprotech Inc. Rockyhill, NJ, USA).

Concentration profiling of inhibitors
Optimal concentration (Copt) of inhibitors, defined
as the concentration that increases RAIU to the greatest
extent, was determined by performing RAIU on cells
treated with inhibitor concentrations ranging from
nanomolar to micromolar range to a maximum of up to
50 μM. If the greatest increase in RAIU was observed
at a much lower concentration within the tested range,
concentration as high as 50 μM was not tested. The results
are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

RAIU and iodide efflux assays
These assays were performed as previously described
[21, 24]. Note that RAIU assay measures RAI accumulation
within cells, which reflects the equilibrium between NISmediated RAI influx and non-NIS-mediated RAI efflux.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed and subjected to gel
electrophoresis and Western blot analysis as previously
described [10]. In this study, 4–20% gradient
Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad Laboratories
Inc., Hercules, CA) were used. NIS protein was detected
using PA716 rNIS polyclonal antibody (provided by
S.S-R.) at a dilution of 1:1500. Phospho-ERK (pERK),
total ERK, phospho-Akt (pAkt), total Akt and BRAF
were detected using 1:1000 dilution of antibodies
from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Cat. # 9101,
9126, 9271, 9272) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
(Dallas, TX; Cat. # sc-5284) respectively. Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG
secondary antibodies were used accordingly. Equivalent
protein loading among samples was monitored by
probing for GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.;
Cat. 2118). Densitometry analysis was performed using
ImageJ software.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
Immortalized PCCl3 rat thyroid cells were
maintained in 6H media with 5% bovine serum as
described earlier [10]. PCCl3 rat thyroid cells are
authenticated as thyroid cells as they express NIS
upon TSH stimulation. The absence of human cell line
contamination is confirmed by western blots where NIS
is detected only by rat NIS antibody and not detected
by human NIS antibody. PCCl3 TetOn-BRAFV600E cells
[22] and PCCl3 TetOn-RET/PTC3 cells [23], generous
gifts from Dr. James Fagin, Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center, New York, NY, were genetically modified
from PCCl3 cells to allow doxycycline (dox)-inducible
expression of BRAFV600E or RET/PTC3 oncogenes
respectively. Schematic design of experiments is shown
in Supplementary figure 1. Experiments were performed
under acute TSH stimulation, where cells were withdrawn
from TSH for 5 days (5H media) and then TSH was
added back for 48 hours prior to treatment with various

RESULTS

DNA was removed by on-column DNase I digestion
according to manufacturer’s protocol. One microgram
of extracted RNA was used for First-Strand Synthesis
reverse transcription reaction (Invitrogen, Waltham,
MA) performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)
was performed in a 25μl reaction mixture, containing
cDNA template, iQ SYBR Green PCR MasterMix (BioRad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA) and primers.
Reaction mixtures were incubated at 50°C for 2 min
followed by an initial activation at 95°C for 3 min, and
then subjected to 40 PCR cycles of denaturation (95°C
for 15 s), annealing and extension using ABI HT7900
instrument (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) by
the Nucleic Acids Shared Resource at the OSUCCC.
For Ano-1 and CFTR, annealing was at 58°C for
30 s and extension was at 72°C for 45 s. For Pendrin,
ClC-5 and GAPDH, annealing and extension were
at 60°C for 1 min. The primers used are as follows:
Ano-1 (F: 5′-GAAACGGAAGCAGATGAGAC-3′;
R: 5′-GGCTTCATACTCTGCTCTGG-3′) [25]; CFTR
(F:

The PI3Ki, GDC-0941, outperforms other
inhibitors in further increasing TSH-stimulated
RAI accumulation in BRAFV600E expressing
PCCl3 cells
The optimal concentration (Copt) that increased RAIU
to the greatest extent was determined for each selected
oncological pipeline inhibitor in PCCl3 cells, BRAFV600E
expressing PCCl3 cells, and RET/PTC3 expressing PCCl3
cells (Supplementary Table 1). The Copt of Akti and PI3Ki
were the same regardless of BRAFV600E or RET/PTC3
overexpression. RET/PTC3 expressing cells required
the highest Copt for MEKi, yet a lower Copt for Hsp90i.
While BRAFV600E expressing cells required the lowest Copt
for BRAFi GSK2118436, RET/PTC3 expressing cells
required the lowest Copt for BRAFi PLX-4032.
The fold increase in RAIU by each inhibitor at its Copt
is shown in Figure 1. In PCCl3 cells, PI3Ki GDC-0941,
Hsp90i and BRAFi significantly increased RAIU to
a comparable extent of ~3–4-fold (p-values < 0.01)
(Figure 1A). In BRAFV600E expressing PCCl3 cells, PI3Ki
GDC-0941 outperforms the other inhibitors by significantly
increasing RAIU to ~7-fold (p-values < 0.0001)
(Figure 1B). In RET/PTC3 expressing PCCl3 cells, MEKi
GSK1120212, PI3Ki GDC-0941, and BRAFi GSK2118436
significantly increased RAIU to a comparable extent of
~3-fold (p-values < 0.0001) (Figure 1C).
MEKi did not increase RAIU in PCCl3 cells but
increased RAIU in BRAFV600E or RET/PTC3 expressing
cells, in which MEK pathway is overly activated. PI3Ki
GDC-0941 and Hsp90i increased RAIU in PCCl3 cells
and BRAFV600E expressing cells to a greater extent than
in RET/PTC3 expressing cells. Surprisingly, BRAFi only
moderately increased RAIU in BRAFV600E expressing cells.
Taken together, our data indicate that PI3Ki GDC-0941
may be effective in further increasing TSH-stimulated RAI
accumulation in BRAFV600E expressing thyroid cancer cells
as well as thyroid remnants.

Statistical analysis
All experiments had at least two independent trials
with three replicates for each experimental group within
each trial. For RAIU assay, all the data values were log10
transformed to reduce variance and skewness, and then
linear mixed effects models were used to take account of
the correlations among observations from the same trial.
For RAI efflux assays, the data was first normalized to
the total iodide within cells at time 0 and then the percent
remaining iodide at each time point was analyzed using
linear mixed effects model. For RT-qPCR data, linear
mixed effects models were used for analysis along with
the ΔΔCT method. From the model, all the pre-specified
comparisons for each experiment were obtained and
adjusted for multiple comparisons using a sequentially
rejective Holm’s method [28] to control for type I error
at 0.05. An interaction between two treatments is claimed
synergistic only if [(A+B)-A)] > (B-control) and the
difference [(A+B)-A]-(B-control) is significant after
controlling for multiple testing. An interaction between
two treatments is claimed additive if (A+B) is significantly
better than A or B alone, but the synergy didn’t reach
significance. SAS v9.2 software was used for analysis
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

TGF-β reduces the extent of increase in TSHstimulated RAIU by inhibitors
TGF-β, a cytokine present in the thyroid tumor
microenvironment, not only promotes tumor invasiveness
[16, 17] but also decreases NIS expression and RAIU [16,
18–20]. Consequently, the invasive thyroid cancer cells
might be less targeted by RAI therapy. We examined the
effects of inhibitors on TSH-stimulated RAIU in the
presence of TGF-β to recapitulate the effects of tumor
microenvironment. As shown in Figure 2, the extent of
increase in RAIU by all inhibitors was greatly reduced by
TGF-β in both BRAFV600E expressing cells and RET/PTC3
expressing cells.

on TSH-stimulated RAIU in the presence of TGF-β is shown in A. PCCl3 cells, B. PCCl3/Tet-On BRAFV600E and C. PCCl3/Tet-On RET/

doxycycline (dox) was added with TSH to induce oncogene expression. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (n = 3) and are

The increase in RAIU by Akti MK-2206 was
completely abolished by TGF-β in both BRAFV600E and RET/
PTC3 expressing cells, yet was only moderately reduced by
TGF-β in PCCl3 cells. RAIU reduction by TGF-β in MEKi
GSK1120212 treated cells was equally extensive in all three
cells. RAIU reduction by TGF-β among PI3Ki GDC-0941
treated cells was most pronounced in BRAFV600E expressing
cells, yet its RAIU level was much higher than TGF-β(+)/
GDC-0941(−) cells. Interestingly, TGF-β did not reduce but
increased RAIU in BRAFi PLX-4032-treated PCCl3 cells.
Taken together, the efficacy of inhibitors in increasing TSHstimulated RAIU in the invasive fronts of thyroid cancer is
most likely to be compromised by the presence of TGF-β in

tumor microenvironment. In the presence of TGF-β, PI3Ki
GDC-0941 or Hsp90i STA-9090 conferred to higher RAIU
than other inhibitors in both BRAFV600E and RET/PTC3
expressing cells.

Apigenin counteracts the effect of TGF-β on
RAIU reduction
We previously reported that Apigenin, a plantderived flavonoid, further augmented the increase of TSHstimulated RAIU by Akt inhibitors [21]. In the absence
of TGF-β, Apigenin co-treatment further increased RAIU
only in combination with the Akti MK-2206 (p-values

< 0.0001) but not with other inhibitors in all three cells
examined (Supplementary Figure 2). The extent of
increase in RAIU by Apigenin co-treatment with Akti
MK-2206 was synergistic in BRAFV600E or RET/PTC3
expressing cells but was additive in parental PCCl3 cells.
In PCCl3 cells, RAIU reduction by TGF-β was
counteracted by Apigenin co-treatment in combination with
Akti or MEKi, but not with PI3Ki or Hsp90i (Figure 3A). In
BRAFV600E expressing cells or RET/PTC3 expressing cells,
RAIU reduction by TGF-β was counteracted by Apigenin
co-treatment in combination with all the inhibitors examined
(Figure 3B & 3C). Apigenin’s counteraction to TGF-β’s
action on RAIU reduction was most evident in combination
with Akti MK-2206, followed by PI3Ki GDC-0941 and
MEKi GSK1120212 (p-values < 0.0001). Apigenin’s effect
was synergistic in combination with PI3Ki and additive in
combination with MEKi and Hsp90i to increase RAIU.
Apigenin’s effect in increasing RAIU was neither synergistic
nor additive to Akti MK-2206 as the increase of RAIU level
by Apigenin alone was equivalent to Apigenin co-treatment
with Akti MK-2206 in the presence of TGF-β.
In the absence of inhibitor treatment, TGF-β reduced
RAIU and Apigenin reversed it in all three cells examined.
The extent of RAIU reduction by TGF-β was greater in
oncogene expressing PCCl3 cells than parental PCCl3
cells, i.e. 70% reduction versus 50% reduction. Similarly,
the extent of reversing RAIU reduction by Apigenin was
more evident in oncogene expressing PCCl3 cells than
parental PCCl3 cells. Our data indicate that Apigenin
may overcome RAIU reduction by TGF-β at the invasive
fronts of thyroid cancer, in particular when Apigenin is
administered in combination with PI3Ki, MEKi, or Hsp90i
to further increase RAIU.

We have previously reported that Hsp90i
17-AAG increases RAIU in thyroid cells at least in part
by decreasing RAI efflux rate [5]. Since the extent of
increase in RAIU by GDC-0941 was not accompanied
by the same extent of increase in NIS protein levels or
cell surface NIS levels (data not shown), we examined
the effect of PI3Ki GDC-0941 on RAI efflux rate. GDC0941 significantly decreased RAI efflux rate (p-values
< 0.0001) to a much greater extent than Hsp90i STA9090 or Hsp90i 17-AAG in BRAFV600E expressing cells
(Figure 5A) as well as PCCl3 cells (data not shown). As
shown in Figure 5B, the decrease in RAI efflux rate by
GDC-0941 was slightly reversed by co-treatment with
TGF-β and/or Apigenin. However, TGF-β and Apigenin
alone or in combination did not alter RAI efflux rate
without co-treatment with GDC-0941. Taken together,
GDC-0941 extensively decreased RAI efflux rate in
BRAFV600E expressing PCCl3 cells regardless of the
presence of TGF-β or Apigenin.

GDC-0941 may decrease RAI efflux rate in part
by decreasing Pendrin and Ano-1 mRNA levels
Several transporters have been implicated
in thyroidal iodide efflux, such as Pendrin (SLC26A4)
[31–34], Anoctamin-1 (Ano-1; TMEM16A) [25,
35], Chloride Channel Voltage-sensitive 5 (ClC-5;
CLCN5) [36] and Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane
Conductance Regulator (CFTR; ABCC7) [37]. To
uncover the mechanisms underlying the decrease in
RAI efflux rate by GDC-0941, we examined mRNA
levels of these transporters in BRAFV600E expressing
cells treated with PI3Ki GDC-0941, Hsp90i STA-9090
or 17-AAG.
CFTR expression was not detected in these PCCl3
rat thyroid cells, in concordance with the observation that
CFTR is not expressed in the FRT rat thyroid cell lines as
well [38]. There was not much change in ClC-5 mRNA
levels by the treatments (data not shown). Induction of
BRAFV600E expression did not alter the mRNA levels of
these transporters. Pendrin mRNA level was decreased
by Hsp90i STA-9090 and 17-AAG, which is consistent
with previous report [39], as well as by PI3Ki GDC0941 (Figure 6A). Ano-1 mRNA level was decreased by
GDC-0941 to a greater extent than Hsp90i STA-9090 and
17-AAG (Figure 6B). Taken together, GDC-0941 may
decrease RAI efflux rate in part by decreasing Pendrin
and/or Ano-1 mRNA level.
We also examined whether co-treatment with
TGF-β and/or Apigenin alters the levels of transporters
in GDC-0941-treated cells. Apigenin co-treatment
did not alter mRNA levels of Pendrin or Ano-1 in
GDC-0941 treated cells (Figure 6C, 6D). TGF-β
drastically increased Pendrin mRNA levels (Figure 6C)

Apigenin counteracts TGF-β’s effect on NIS
reduction
Since BRAFV600E oncogene is the most common
mutation found in thyroid cancer and is associated with
radioiodine refractory disease [29, 30], we examined
NIS protein levels in BRAFV600E expressing cells
co-treated with TGF-β and inhibitors in the presence or
absence of Apigenin. As shown in Figure 4, NIS protein
level was decreased by dox induction of BRAFV600E, and
TGF-β further decreased NIS protein level in BRAFV600E
expressing cells. NIS reduction by TGF-β was reversed
by MEKi GSK1120212 but not by PI3Ki GDC-0941.
However, Apigenin increased NIS protein levels in all TGFβ-treated cells with or without inhibitor treatment. TGF-β
modestly increased pERK levels in BRAFV600E expressing
PCCl3 cells and Apigenin co-treatment had little effect on
pERK levels. TGF-β extensively decreased pAkt level and
Apigenin modestly increased pAkt level. Taken together,
our data indicate that Apigenin reversed RAIU reduction
in TGF-β treated cells (Figure 3) mainly by counteracting
TGF-β’s effect on NIS reduction (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION

regardless of co-treatment with GDC-0941 and/or
Apigenin. As shown in Figure 5B, co-treatment of
TGF-β with GDC-0941 did increase RAIU efflux rate
in the presence of BRAFV600E induction. However,
increased Pendrin mRNA level by TGF-β alone or in
the presence of Apigenin did not translate into increased
RAI efflux rate.

treatment with the inhibitors that were shown to increase
TSH-stimulated RAIU in the absence of TGF-β. We
found that RAIU reduction by TGF-β is mainly by
decreasing NIS protein levels and NIS reduction by
TGF-β can be counteracted by co-treatment of Apigenin.
PI3Ki GDC-0941 had little effect on NIS protein levels
but decreased iodide efflux rate to a great extent, thereby
contributing to the increase in RAIU. Taken together,
co-treatment of Apigenin with PI3Ki GDC-0941 may
increase therapeutic efficacy of RAI for invasive fronts of
thyroid cancer, by utilizing two distinct mechanisms—by
increasing NIS protein level to counteract TGF-β’s effect
on NIS reduction and by decreasing RAI efflux rate,
respectively.
The Akti MK-2206 increased RAIU in parental
and BRAFV600E oncogenic context but not in the RET/
PTC3 context, suggesting that RAIU reduction in RET/
PTC3 expressing PCCl3 cells is independent of Akt
activation. MEKi GSK1120212 and AZD6244 increased
RAIU in BRAFV600E or RET/PTC3 expressing cells but
not in parental PCCl3 cells, as MEK was not overly
activated in parental PCCl3 cells. MEKi AZD6244 was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reported to increase RAIU in 4/9, 5/5, 2/3 and 1/3 patients
with BRAFV600E, NRAS, RET/PTC mutations and wild
type respectively [14]. The BRAFi GSK2118436 has
been shown to increase RAIU in 6/10 patients carrying
BRAFV600E mutation [15]. Both MEKi and BRAFi are
known to increase RAIU mainly by increasing NIS
protein level. In contrast, Akti and PI3Ki increase RAIU
by increasing RAI influx rate [10] and by decreasing RAI
efflux rate, respectively.
It is puzzling that PI3Ki GDC-0941 increased RAIU
to a greater extent than MEKi in BRAFV600E expressing
cells, as MEK is the canonical downstream of BRAFV600E.
One possible explanation is that MAPK activation by
BRAFV600E may also disturb the equilibrium of PI3K
pathway, as cross-talk may occur between PI3K and
MAPK at multiple levels [40]. As shown in Figure 4,
MEKi (GSK1120212) abolished pERK level yet increased
pAkt level; PI3Ki (GDC-0941) not only decreased pAkt
level but also pERK level.
In thyroid cancers, TGF-β decreases NIS expression
in the invasive margins [16, 17] that could enable the
cells to escape RAI ablation and lead to RAI-refractory

treatment with reagents for 24 hours before efflux assay. 2 μg/ml doxycycline (dox) was added with TSH to induce oncogene expression.

metastatic lesions. Our finding that Apigenin counteracts
TGF-β’s effect on RAIU reduction indicates that RAIU
in invasive fronts of thyroid cancer can be increased to
improve efficacy of RAI therapy. Apigenin has been
reported to counteract the effects of TGF-β in other contexts
as well, such as TGF-β-induced fibroblast to myofibroblast
transition in human lungs [41] and TGF-β-induced VEGF
expression in human prostate carcinoma cells by inhibiting
Src/FAK/Akt and thereby Smad2/3 phosphorylation [42].
TGF-β in the tumor microenvironment is secreted both
by the tumor cells and surrounding macrophages. While
BRAFV600E expressing cells secrete TGF-β in an autocrine
loop [16], the addition of exogenous TGF-β recapitulates
TGF-β secretion from macrophages. Apigenin has also
been reported to reduce TGF-β production in human glioma
cells [43], in rat renal cells damaged by cyclosporine [44],
in rat mesangial cells induced by serotonin [45] and in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

human pancreatic stellate cells stimulated by parathyroid
hormone-related protein [46]. Taken together, Apigenin
may increase RAIU in the invasive fronts of thyroid cancer
not only by counteracting TGF-β’s action but also by
decreasing TGF-β production from invasive tumor cells.
PI3Ki GDC-0941 had little effect on NIS protein
levels but decreased iodide efflux rate to a great extent.
PI3Ki BKM-120 had similar effect except the decrease
in iodide efflux rate was much lesser than GDC-0941
(data not shown). These findings are different from
studies showing that PI3Ki LY294002 increased NIS
expression [9, 10] but had no effect on iodide efflux rate
[9]. GDC-0941 is an ATP-pocket binding Class I PI3K
inhibitor, structurally different from and more potent than
BKM-120 [47]. GDC-0941 has fewer off-target effects
even at micromolar concentrations compared to BKM-120
or LY294002 [47, 48]. One major difference between these

results showing relative mRNA levels of A, C. Pendrin and B, D. Ano-1 in PCCl3/Tet-On BRAFV600E cells treated with reagents as indicated.
Cells were deprived of TSH for five days and then stimulated with TSH for 48 hours, followed by treatment with reagents for 24 hours
before RNA extraction. 2 μg/ml doxycycline (dox) was added with TSH to induce oncogene expression. Data are expressed as mean ±
standard deviation (n = 3) and are representative of two independent trials.

Class I PI3K inhibitors is that GDC-0941 and BKM-120
target all four isoforms (p110 α/β/δ/γ) at nanomolar
concentrations, while LY294002 targets only p110 α/β/δ
but not p110γ even at micromolar concentrations. Thus,
p110γ isoform may play a major role in modulating iodide
efflux rate. Since Akti did not alter iodide efflux rate and
pAkt level was low in TGF-β-treated BRAFV600E expressing
cells, the effect of GDC-0941 on decreasing iodide efflux
rate is most likely mediated by other downstream effectors,
such as PKCs, PKN, SGK or S6K [49].
Clinical trials are ongoing to confirm that RAI
therapy can be improved by further enhancing TSHstimulated RAIU with MEKi or BRAFi. However, it is
concerning that RAIU increase by MEKi or BRAFi was

considerably compromised by TGF-β, which is present
in the invasive fronts of thyroid cancer. Our data showed
that, in the presence of TGF-β, GDC-0941 with Apigenin
co-treatment had the highest RAIU level in both
BRAFV600E expressing cells and RET/PTC3 expressing
cells (Figure 3B, 3C). However, inherent differences
in thyroid cells of different species [50, 51] are well
recognized. Furthermore, the efficacy of small molecule
inhibitors depends on the signaling context of cancer cells
that may not be recapitulated in our oncogene-expressing
PCCl3 cells. Thus, clinical translation of our findings
requires further validation in preclinical mouse models as
well as in human clinical trials. Once validated, Apigenin
may serve as a dietary supplement along with small
