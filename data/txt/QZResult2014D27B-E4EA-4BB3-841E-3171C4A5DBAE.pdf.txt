Abstract
The DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine
(5-aza-CdR) inhibits DNA methyltransferase activity and
sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy, but the mechanisms
of its sensitization are not fully understood. Here, we show
that 5-aza-CdR induces tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in the human breast cancer
MDA-231 cells. Induction of TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR correlated
with inactivation of Akt. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of the active form of Akt by adenovirus infection or
inhibition of the Akt downstream target glycogen synthase
kinase 3 by its pharmacologic inhibitors abolishes TRAIL
induction by 5-aza-CdR. Importantly, we show that the
combined treatment of breast cancer cells with 5-aza-CdR
and Adriamycin significantly increases apoptotic cell death
compared with the treatment with either agent alone.
Moreover, the combined treatment activated both death
receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, whereas
Adriamycin alone activated only the mitochondrial pathway
while 5-aza-CdR failed to activate either. More importantly,
down-regulation of TRAIL by small interference RNA silencing
decreased 5-aza-CdR–mediated Adriamycin-induced caspase
activation and apoptosis, thus conferring Adriamycin resistance. Taken together, our results suggest that induction of
TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR is critical for enhancing chemosensitivity of
breast cancer cells to Adriamycin. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1203–11]

Introduction
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL), also known as Apo2 ligand, is a member of the TNF ligand
family (1, 2). TRAIL induces apoptosis in a variety of transformed
or tumor cells but not normal cells (3, 4). Importantly, TRAIL
(under the name of Apo2L/TRAIL) is being tested in phase I
clinical trials (2). There are four membrane-bound TRAIL
receptors: DR4 (5), DR5 (6–9), TRAIL-R3 (10, 11), and TRAIL-R4
(12, 13). Because both DR4 and DR5 are proapoptotic receptors,
activation of these two receptors leads to activation of caspases
(14). On the other hand, because TRAIL-R3 lacks an intracellular
domain, and because TRAIL-R4 has a truncated death domain,
both TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 can antagonize TRAIL-induced
apoptosis by competing for ligand binding (14). Upon activation
of DR4 and DR5 by TRAIL binding, caspase-8 is recruited via

Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) to the death-inducing
signaling complex (DISC) and is subsequently activated (14).
Activated caspase-8 directly activates caspase-3, caspase-6, and
caspase-7 or activates the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated pathway through caspase-8–mediated Bid cleavage, which indirectly
activates caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 (15–17).
5-Aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) is an inhibitor of DNA
methyltransferases, which can inhibit DNA methyltransferases
and reverse DNA methylation (18). 5-Aza-CdR was originally
synthesized as an antimetabolite agent that induces differentiation
of acute myelogenous leukemia (19). Studies showed that 5-azaCdR can inhibit cancer cell growth, particularly leukemia cells (19).
The mechanisms underlying its anticancer activity are not fully
understood, but it is believed to reactivate genes, including the
tumor suppressor genes p16, E-cadherin, and hMLH1 in cancer
cells (20). Reactivation of these genes is associated with cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis, which leads to inhibition of tumor cell growth
(20). By using microarray screen technology, it has been found
that there are a limited number of genes that are reactivated by
5-aza-CdR in tumors (21). Furthermore, it has been shown that
5-aza-CdR can activate the p53 pathway, independent of demethylation of the p53 promoter (22).
Despite its promising anticancer activity, the early clinical trials
showed that 5-aza-CdR has low anticancer activity and high toxicity.
Recent studies showed that low doses of 5-aza-CdR exhibit promising clinical activity against hematologic malignancies (23). In
addition, a study showed that 5-aza-CdR in combination with other
anticancer agents has a synergistic effect on activation of silenced
tumor suppressor gene (24). Extending this finding to the clinical
setting has found that the combination of 5-aza-CdR with histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors has better efficacy than use of either
agent alone (25). Thus, combination regimens have the advantage
over a single agent to treat cancer. In addition, it has been shown
that 5-aza-CdR sensitizes lung cancer cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood (26).
Here, we show that 5-aza-CdR induces TRAIL via the Akt
pathway. Induction of TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR enhanced Adriamycininduced apoptosis in the human breast cancer cells. Importantly,
down-regulation of TRAIL by small interference RNA (siRNA)
silencing decreased caspase activation and abrogated 5-aza-CdR–
mediated sensitization of breast cancer cells to Adriamycininduced cell death. Our data indicate that induction of TRAIL by
5-aza-CdR plays a critical role in sensitization of breast cancer cells
to Adriamycin and suggest that TRAIL ligand is a potential target
for cancer therapy.

(St. Louis, MO). The glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor Ro-318220
was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). MS275 was obtained from
Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Adriamycin was obtained from the
Oncology Outpatient Pharmacy at the Karmanos Cancer Institute.
Monoclonal anti-human TRAIL, DR4, and polyclonal DR5 antibodies were
purchased from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Rabbit anti-caspase-9, anticaspase-8, anti-caspase-7, anti-caspase-3, and anti–poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The adenovirus vectors encoding the
myristoylated active form of Akt (AxCA-Myr-Akt) and control viruses
encoding galactosidase (AdCA-LacZ) were kindly provided by Dr. Wataru
Ogawa (Kobe University School of Medicine, Chuo-ku, Japan), as described
previously (27).
Cell lines, culture conditions, and treatment. The human breast
cancer MCF-7 cells were obtained from the Karmanos Cancer Institute. The
human breast cancer MDA-231 and T47-D cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in
DMEM. These cells were supplemented with either 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) for MDA-231 and T47-D or 5% FBS for MCF-7 and antibiotics at
37jC in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells
were treated with various concentrations of 5-aza-CdR and/or Adriamycin
for different intervals of time as indicated in each figure legend. Cells were
infected with adenovirus encoding AxCA-Akt or control LacZ viruses, as
described previously (28).
Isolation of RNA, reverse transcription-PCR, and Northern blot
analysis. Total cellular RNA was purified from cells using the Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After reverse transcription of 2 Ag of total RNA by oligo(dT) priming, the
resulting single-strand cDNA was amplified using Taq DNA polymerase
(Promega, Madison, WI) and specific primers directed against human
TRAIL (5-CAATGACGAAGAGAGTATGA-3¶ and 5-TGGGAATAGATGTAGTAAAA-3¶). PCR conditions were 94jC/2 min; 34 cycles at 94jC/30 s, 50jC/
30 s, and 72jC/30 s followed by 72jC/7 min for the final extension. Aliquots
(10 AL) of the amplified cDNA were separated by 1.5% agarose gel
electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and compared
with the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(5-AGTCGGATACACACATATTCATCA and 5-ATGGTGGGGTAGATCTTCTTCT-3¶). For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (10 Ag) was separated
in a 1.5% formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted to Hybond-N+ membrane
(Amersham Pharmacia, Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The blots were hybridized
with radiolabeled human TRAIL cDNA, as described previously (29).
Radioactive signals were analyzed by autoradiography.
siRNA transfection for knockdown of TRAIL. siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO). The
targeted sequences for TRAIL siRNA were 5-AACGAGCUGAAGCAGAUGCAGdTdT-3¶ (sense) and 5-CUGCAUCUGCUUCAGCUCGUUdTdT-3¶ (antisense), as described previously (30). The transfection was done as suggested
by Dharmacon, with slight modifications. Briefly, MDA-231 cells were plated
at 3  105 per well in six-well plates. The next day, cells were transfected with
TRAIL siRNA oligonucleotides or scrambled oligonucleotides (20 nmol/L)
using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). After 3 days, transfected cells were
harvested for examining the expression of TRAIL protein by Western blot
analysis, or subjected to the treatments. To determine chemosensitivity,
transfected cells were placed at 4,000 per well in 96-well plates and then
treated with or without 5-aza-CdR (10 Amol/L) in the presence or absence
of Adriamycin (0.1 Ag/mL) for 72 h, and cell viability was determined
by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assays.
MTT assays. MTT assay was previously described (31). Briefly, cells were
treated with 5-aza-CdR at different doses for various times. In the
experiments involving Adriamycin, cells were treated with Adriamycin
(0.1 Ag/mL) in the presence or absence of 5-aza-CdR (10 Amol/L). After
incubation with MTT solution, Isopropanol was added to dissolve the
formazan crystals. Absorbance was measured using a Vmax Microplate
Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 600 nm. The survival was
calculated from the mean of pooled data from three separate experiments
with four wells (31).

Western blot analysis. Whole-cell lysates were prepared as described
previously (32), and protein concentration was determined using the
Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Cell lysates (100 Ag) were
electrophoresed through 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc., Keene, NH). The blots
were probed or reprobed with the antibodies, and bound antibody was
detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent or ECL Plus
reagent (Amersham Pharmacia, Biotech) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
Determination of half-life of TRAIL protein. MDA-231 cells were left
untreated or treated with 10 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR for 24 h, and cycloheximide
(5 Ag/mL) was added to the cells. Cells were harvested at the indicated time
points. The levels of TRAIL protein were determined by Western blot
analysis.
Assay of caspase-3 activity. The enzymatic activity of caspase-3 was
assayed using the caspase-3 colorimetric assay kit (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells
were left untreated or treated with 5-aza-CdR, Adriamycin, or in combination
for 72 h and then lysed in lysis buffer for 10 min on ice. The lysed cells were
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and 150 Ag protein was incubated with
50 AL of reaction buffer and 5 AL of caspase-3 substrate at 37jC for 1 h, and
the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm on a plate reader.
Flow cytometry. Subconfluent cells were left untreated or treated
with 5-aza-CdR (10 Amol/L) in the presence or absence of Adriamycin
(0.1 Ag/mL) for 72 h. Cells were then harvested and fixed with ice-cold
70% (v/v) ethanol for 24 h. After centrifugation at 200  g for 5 min, the cell
pellet was washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and resuspended in PBS containing
propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL), Triton X-100 (0.1%, v/v), and DNase-free
RNase (1 Ag/mL). Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h,
and DNA content was determined by flow cytometry using a FACScan flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).
Construction of reporter vectors. TRAIL reporter vectors were
constructed previously (33). Briefly, pGL3-TRAIL1 containing a 2.196-kb
fragment of the human TRAIL promoter, including upstream of the
translational start site, was amplified from human placental DNA using
GC-Rich PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN)
and the following primers: 5 CCGCTCGAGCGATCTCTTGACCTCATGAT-3¶ and 5-CCCAAGCTTGATCCTGTCAGAGTCTGACTGCTG-3¶. The
PCR conditions for amplifying the fragment were as follows: 95jC/3 min;
30 cycles at 95jC/30 s, 65jC/30 s, and 68jC/2.25 min, followed by 68jC/7
min for the final extension. The amplified fragment was isolated from 1%
agarose gel, digested with XhoI and HindIII, and subcloned into pGL3-Basic
(Promega). The insert was verified by DNA sequencing. Using pGL3-TRAIL1
as a template, several deletion constructs were generated by PCR using the
above reverse primer and the following forward primers: pGL3-TRAIL2
(5-CCGCTCGAGGAGGCAGGAGAATTGCTT-3¶), pGL3-TRAIL3 (5-CCGCTCGAGGACATTCAAGATGGAATTATG-3¶), and pGL3-TRAIL4 (5-CCGCTCGAGGAGAAATGGGCTTGAGGTGAG-3¶). The PCR conditions were the same
as used for amplifying pGL3-TRAIL1.
Luciferase reporter assays. Transfections for luciferase assays were
carried out as described previously (28). Briefly, MDA-231 cells were plated
at 6  105 per well in six-well plates. The next day, the cells were transfected
with 5 Ag of reporter constructs and 5 ng of pRLSV40 (Promega) using
LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, transfected cells were
treated with or without 5-aza-CdR (10 Amol/L) or 10 Amol/L MS275 for
24 h. Firefly luciferase activities were assayed using the dual-luciferase
reporter assay system (Promega) in a Turner TD20/20 luminometer and
normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using Student’s t test.
The data were presented as the mean F SD, and P V 0.05 was considered
significant.

TRAIL and 5-Aza-2 ¶-CdR–Mediated Adriamycin Sensitivity

can effectively inhibit breast cancer cell growth, we treated three
breast cancer cell lines (MDA-231, MCF-7, and T47-D) with various
doses of 5-aza-CdR for 72 h, and the effects of 5-aza-CdR on growth
inhibition were determined by MTT assays. As shown in Fig. 1A,
5-aza-CdR inhibited the growth of all three cell lines in a dosedependent manner; MDA-231 was the most sensitive line, whereas
both MCF-7 and T47-D cells were equally sensitive to 5-aza-CdR
(Fig. 1A). We chose to focus on MDA-231 cells in this study because
this line was more sensitive than the other lines to 5-aza-CdR. It has
been shown that 5-aza-CdR can enhance conventional chemotherapeutic agent–induced anticancer activity (26). To determine
whether 5-aza-CdR–mediated growth inhibition can be enhanced
by chemotherapeutic agents, MDA-231 cells were treated with
5-aza-CdR in combination with Adriamycin. Figure 1B shows that
the growth inhibition was about 76% in cells treated with 5-aza-CdR
in combination with Adriamycin (0.1 Ag/mL), compared with
f54% in cells treated with Adriamycin alone, whereas 5-aza-CdR
alone caused f48% of growth inhibition. These data suggest that
5-aza-CdR could enhance sensitivity of MDA-231 cells to Adriamycin.
It has been known that both 5-aza-CdR and Adriamycin can
kill cells in part by apoptosis. To determine the mechanisms
underlying 5-aza-CdR–mediated sensitization, we examined the

activation of the apoptotic pathways. As shown in Fig. 1C,
Adriamycin treatment resulted in modest cleavage of caspase-9,
caspase-3, and PARP, which indicates that the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway is activated. Minimal cleavage of caspase-8 by
Adriamycin treatment (Fig. 1C) is consistent with the fact that
chemotherapeutic agents, including Adriamycin, mainly target the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In contrast, the combination of
10 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR with 0.1 Ag/mL Adriamycin significantly
enhanced cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-7, and PARP, compared
with cells treated with Adriamycin alone, whereas such changes
were not observed in cells treated with 5-aza-CdR (10 Amol/L)
alone (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the combined treatment of 5-aza-CdR
and Adriamycin resulted in a significant increase in cleavage of
caspase-8, which was not significant in cells treated with
Adriamycin alone (Fig. 1C). Cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9
in cells treated with both 5-aza-CdR and Adriamycin indicates that
both the death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways are
activated. In addition, combined treatment also enhanced cleavage
of caspase-3 (Fig. 1C) and caspase-3 activity (Fig. 1D) relative to the
treatments with single agent alone. Furthermore, we analyzed
apoptotic cell death by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.
Figure 1E shows that 5-aza-CdR and Adriamycin treatments

resulted in f11% and f23% of the cell population in sub-G1
(apoptotic cells), respectively. In contrast, the combined treatments
resulted in f39% of the cell population in sub-G1 (Fig. 1E). Taken
together, these results suggest that the enhanced effects of the
combined treatments on cell death are attributable to the
augmented induction of apoptosis.
5-Aza-CdR induces TRAIL expression in MDA-231 cells. We
previously showed that 5-aza-CdR induces TRAIL in human
fibroblasts (35). Because TRAIL is a potent apoptotic inducer, we
suspected that induction of TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR may be
responsible for chemosensitization. To test this possibility, we
treated the breast cancer cell MDA-231 cells with various doses of
5-aza-CdR for 24 h, and induction of TRAIL was determined by
Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2A, TRAIL protein was induced by
different doses of 5-aza-CdR. Consistent with induction of TRAIL
protein, TRAIL mRNA was induced by 5-aza-CdR, determined by
both Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR, respectively
(Fig. 2B). To determine whether 5-aza-CdR affects the expression of
TRAIL receptors, we examined the levels of DR4 and DR5 proteins.
Figure 2A shows that 5-aza-CdR treatment does not increase DR4
and DR5 protein, which suggests that such induction is TRAIL
ligand specific.
5-Aza-CdR and HDACI regulate TRAIL expression by
different mechanisms. It has been shown that inhibitors of
HDAC can induce TRAIL expression via activation of the TRAIL
promoter in the human leukemia cells (36, 37). Because the DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors, including 5-aza-CdR, couple with
inhibitors of HDACs to activate gene expression (24), it was
possible that induction of TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR may be through
the same mechanism as mediated by HDACIs (36, 37). To test
this possibility, we transfected MDA-231 with either the TRAIL
luciferase reporter constructs pGL3-TRAIL1, pGL3-TRAIL2,
pGL3-TRAIL3, and pGL3-TRAIL4 or the empty vector pGL3-basic
and then treated cells with 5-aza-CdR (10 Amol/L) or MS275
(10 Amol/L). Cells were harvested after 24 h, and luciferase activity
was assayed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system.
As shown in Fig. 3B, luciferase activity was not stimulated in
cells transfected with pGL3-TRAIL1, pGL3-TRAIL2, pGL3-TRAIL3,
and pGL3-TRAIL4 upon 5-aza-CdR treatment, compared with
untreated cells. In contrast, the HDACI MS275 was able to
stimulate the TRAIL promoter activity in the breast cancer cell

line MDA-231 (Fig. 3B), which is consistent with two previous
studies showing that HDACI induces TRAIL expression through the
transcriptional activation of the TRAIL promoter (36, 37).
Therefore, our results suggest that 5-aza-CdR–induced TRAIL is
independent of the activation of TRAIL promoter, which is
different from HDACI-mediated TRAIL expression.
Because 5-aza-CdR did not activate the TRAIL promoter
(Fig. 3B), we suspected that 5-aza-CdR–induced TRAIL expression
may be through stabilization of TRAIL protein. To test this
possibility, MDA-231 cells were left untreated or treated with 5-azaCdR (10 Amol/L) for 24 h and then treated with cycloheximide
(5 Ag/mL) for 0 to 120 min, and TRAIL level was examined by
Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3C, the basal half-life of TRAIL
was f30 min. In contrast, 5-aza-CdR treatment significantly
increased the half-life of TRAIL; there was about 85% of TRAIL
remaining at the end of the 120-min cycloheximide treatment
(Fig. 3C). Thus, these results suggest that 5-aza-CdR–induced
TRAIL ligand may be through stabilization of TRAIL protein.
5-Aza-CdR induces TRAIL expression via inhibition of Akt.
A previous study suggested that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt pathway plays an important role in regulation of TRAIL
expression (38). To determine whether Akt is involved in 5-azaCdR–mediated TRAIL induction, we treated MDA-231 cells with
5-aza-CdR for various times and then examined the level of
phosphorylated Akt. As shown in Fig. 4A, 5-aza-CdR treatment
resulted in a decrease in the level of phosphorylated Akt, which
was accompanied with an increase in TRAIL protein. In contrast,
total Akt remained unchanged. These data suggest that Akt may
be involved in the negative regulation of TRAIL, which can be
relieved by 5-aza-CdR treatment. Because Akt can be inhibited
by the phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome
10 (PTEN), we examined the effects of 5-aza-CdR treatment on the
levels of PTEN. Figure 4A shows that 5-aza-CdR treatment has no
effect on the levels of PTEN protein. In addition, because nuclear
factor-nB (NF-nB) and Akt can functionally interact (39), we
examined the levels of total and phosphorylated InB-a because
activation of NF-nB requires phosphorylation and ubiquitinmediated degradation of InB-a by the InB kinase complex. As
shown in Fig. 4A, 5-aza-CdR treatment had no effect on the level of
InB-a. Thus, these results establish a correlation between induction
of TRAIL and inactivation of Akt.

as a loading control. B, induction of TRAIL mRNA by 5-aza-CdR in MDA-231 cells. Cells were treated as in (A), and total RNA was extracted to assay for TRAIL mRNA

as loading controls for Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR, respectively.

for 0, 30, 60, and 120 min. Top, TRAIL and

blotting. Bottom, quantification of

To determine a direct role of Akt in negatively regulating TRAIL
expression upon 5-aza-CdR treatment, we infected MDA-231 cells
with either the control adenoviruses encoding LacZ, or the
adenoviruses encoding the myristoylated active form of Akt (27).
As shown in Fig. 4B, cells infected with adenoviruses encoding the
active form of Akt overexpressed phosphorylated Akt, compared
with cells infected with the control viruses. To determine the
effects of overexpression of the active form of Akt on TRAIL
expression in response to 5-aza-CdR treatment, cells infected with
the LacZ viruses or viruses encoding the active form of Akt were
treated with 5-aza-CdR for 24 h, and the levels of TRAIL were then
determined. Figure 4B shows that 5-aza-CdR induces TRAIL
protein in cells infected with the control LacZ viruses. In contrast,
induction of TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR was abolished in cells infected
with the viruses encoding the myristoylated active form of Akt
(Fig. 4B). These results suggest that relief of Akt-mediated
inhibition may be responsible for TRAIL induction by 5-aza-CdR.
We have shown that overexpression of the active form of Akt can
inhibit TRAIL induction by 5-aza-CdR (Fig. 4B). Because Akt exerts
its activity by phosphorylating its downstream substrates, including GSK3, one would expect that blockade of its substrate activity
could affect Akt function. It has been shown that blockade of the
Akt downstream substrate GSK3 can inhibit TRAIL induction by
wortmannin (38). To test whether inhibition of GSK3 has the same
effect on TRAIL induction by 5-aza-CdR as observed with
wortmannin, we pretreated MDA-231 cells with the GSK3 inhibitor
Ro-318220 for 30 min and then treated these cells with 5-aza-CdR
in the presence of this inhibitor for 24 h, and induction of TRAIL
was then determined. As shown in Fig. 4C, 5-aza-CdR induced
TRAIL expression, compared with untreated cells. In contrast,
Ro-318220 abolished 5-aza-CdR–induced TRAIL (Fig. 4C). Consistent with the results obtained with Ro-318220, LiCl, another
GSK inhibitor (40), was able to abrogate TRAIL induction by
5-aza-CdR (Fig. 4D). Abrogation of TRAIL induction by the GSK3

inhibitors suggests that blockade of Akt-mediated signaling may
be responsible for TRAIL induction by 5-aza-CdR. Thus, our
data clearly indicate that Akt plays an important role in the
negative regulation of TRAIL expression, which can be relieved by
5-aza-CdR.
Induction of TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR is required for sensitization of MDA-231 cells to Adriamycin-induced death. We have
shown that 5-aza-CdR induces TRAIL, and the combination of
5-aza-CdR with Adriamycin enhances cell death relative to either
agent alone. Because TRAIL is a potent apoptotic inducer, we
sought to determine whether induction of TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR is
required for this enhanced killing effect. To this end, MDA-231 cells
were transfected with either control oligos or oligos against TRAIL,
and the effects of siRNA-mediated TRAIL down-regulation on cell
death were determined. As shown in Fig. 5A, the levels of TRAIL in
cells transfected with TRAIL siRNA were decreased compared with
cells transfected with control oligos. Importantly, induction of
TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR was also decreased compared with cells
transfected with control oligos (Fig. 5A), indicating that TRAIL
siRNA is sufficient to down-regulate TRAIL expression. To
determine the effects of down-regulation of TRAIL on cell survival,
MDA-231 cells transfected with either TRAIL siRNA or control
siRNA were treated with 5-aza-CdR, Adriamycin, or in combination
for 72 h, and cell viability was then determined. As shown in
Fig. 5B, cells transfected with TRAIL siRNA were resistant to 5aza-CdR–mediated growth inhibition, compared with cells transfected with non-target oligos; growth inhibition was f7% in cells
transfected with TRAIL siRNA compared with f36% in cells transfected with non-target oligos upon 5-aza-CdR treatment. Similarly,
down-regulation of TRAIL increased cell resistance to Adriamycin
compared with cells transfected with control oligo, although such
resistance was not as significant as observed in cells treated with
5-aza-CdR (Fig. 5B). More importantly, enhanced growth inhibition by the combination was abrogated in cells transfected with

Figure 4. Role of the active form of Akt in 5-aza-CdR–induced TRAIL. A, effects of 5-aza-CdR treatment on the levels of phosphorylated Akt (phospho-Akt).
MDA-231 cells were treated with 10 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h, and total protein was extracted. The levels of TRAIL, phosphorylated Akt,
total Akt, PTEN, phosphorylated InB-a (phospho-IjB-a ), and total InB-a were determined by Western blot analysis. h-Actin was used as a loading control. B,
overexpression of the active form of Akt abolishes TRAIL induction by 5-aza-CdR. MDA-231 cells were infected with the adenoviruses encoding the active form of Akt or
the control viruses and then left untreated or treated with 10 or 20 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR for 24 h. Total protein was extracted for assaying for TRAIL and phosphorylated
Akt proteins. h-Actin was used as a loading control. C and D, inhibition of GSK3 by Ro-318220 and LiCl abolishes TRAIL induction by 5-aza-CdR. MDA-231 cells
were left untreated or pretreated with 2 Amol/L Ro-318220 (C ) or 20 mmol/L LiCl (D ) for 30 min and then treated with 10 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR in the presence of either
inhibitor for 24 h. Total protein was extracted for assaying the levels of TRAIL and total Akt by Western blot analysis. h-Actin was used as a loading control.

TRAIL siRNA, compared with cells transfected with control
oligos (Fig. 5B). Survival rates increased from f20% in cells
transfected with non-targeted siRNA to f41% in cells transfected with TRAIL siRNA following the combined treatment of
5-aza-CdR with Adriamycin. Furthermore, in cells transfected
with TRAIL siRNA, 5-aza-CdR no longer enhanced Adriamycininduced cell death; cell viability was f51% in cells treated with
Adriamycin alone compared with f41% in cells with combined
treatment (Fig. 5B ). Collectively, these results suggest that
TRAIL plays a critical role in enhancing Adriamycin-induced cell
death.
To investigate the effects of down-regulation of TRAIL on 5-azaCdR–mediated Adriamycin-induced apoptosis, cells transfected
with TRAIL siRNA or control oligos were treated with either
5-aza-CdR (10 Amol/L), Adriamycin (0.1 Ag/mL), or in combination
for 72 h, and activation of caspases was then examined. As
expected, in cells transfected with control oligos, activation of
caspase-9, caspase-8, caspase-7, and caspase-3, as well as cleavage
of PARP, was significant in cells treated with both 5-aza-CdR and
Adriamycin, compared with untreated or cells treated with 5-azaCdR alone, whereas such changes was minimal in Adriamycintreated cells (Fig. 5C). In contrast, cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-8,
caspase-3, and PARP was abrogated in cells transfected with TRAIL
siRNA following the combined treatment (Fig. 5C), indicating that
down-regulation of TRAIL abrogates activation of the caspase
cascade induced by the combined treatment, leading to cell
survival. Taken together, these results suggest that TRAIL plays a
critical role in 5-aza-CdR–mediated Adriamycin-induced caspase
activation and apoptosis.

Overexpression of the active form of Akt increases resistance
of breast cancer cells to both 5-aza-CdR and Adriamycin.
We have shown that 5-aza-CdR–mediated inhibition of Akt is
responsible for TRAIL induction. To determine whether overexpression of the active form of Akt affects cell death induced by
5-aza-CdR, Adriamycin, or in combination, we infected MDA-231
cells with either the control adenoviruses or the adenoviruses
encoding the myristoylated active form of Akt, and survival cells
were then counted. In general, cells infected with Akt-adenoviruses
proliferated more rapidly and were more resistant to either agent
alone or in combination, compared with cells infected with the
control viruses (Fig. 6A). We consistently found that there was less
caspase-3 activity in cells infected with the viruses encoding the
active form of Akt over cells infected with control viruses (Fig. 6B),
suggesting that constitutive expression of the active form of Akt
renders MDA-231 cells resistant to anticancer drug-induced
apoptosis. Thus, our data suggest that overexpression of the active
form of Akt gives cells growth advantage and enhances resistance to
anticancer agents in part through suppression of TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis.

Discussion
In this study, we show that 5-aza-CdR enhances Adriamycininduced cell death. We also show that 5-aza-CdR induces TRAIL in
the human breast cancer cell MDA-231. Furthermore, we find that
induction of TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR is abrogated by overexpression of
the active form of Akt. Importantly, down-regulation of TRAIL
expression by siRNA silencing abrogated 5-aza-CdR–mediated

TRAIL and 5-Aza-2 ¶-CdR–Mediated Adriamycin Sensitivity

sensitization of breast cancer cells to Adriamycin. Thus, our
findings suggest for the first time that induction of TRAIL by 5-azaCdR is critical for sensitizing human cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.
5-Aza-CdR is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that activates
gene expression primarily through a demethylation-dependent
mechanism (41). It has also been shown that 5-aza-CdR can induce
gene expression through a demethylation-independent mechanism
including activation of the p53/p21 pathway (22). We have shown
that TRAIL is induced within 1 h upon 5-aza-CdR treatment,
suggesting that induction of TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR occurs before
DNA is demethylated. We believed that induction of TRAIL is an
early event, and that cell death is a later event, which was abolished
by transfection of TRAIL siRNA. Therefore, we conclude that TRAIL
induction by 5-aza-CdR is through a DNA demethylationindependent mechanism.
TRAIL has been shown to selectively kill tumor or transformed
cells while sparing normal cells, but its regulation is not fully
understood. Previous studies suggested that TRAIL induction by
both IFN and retinoid is through the transcription factor IFNstimulated response elements (42–44). In addition, a recent study
showed that inhibitors of HDACs induce TRAIL through activation
of the TRAIL promoter mediated by the transcription factors Sp1
and Sp3 in leukemia cells (36). Because activation of gene
expression could involve both DNA demethylation and histone
acetylation, it is possible that induction of TRAIL by 5-aza-CdR is
through the same mechanism as operated by HDACIs. We have
found that 5-aza-CdR does not activate the TRAIL reporter
constructs, whereas HDACIs were able to activate the TRAIL
reporter construct (Fig. 3B), suggesting that 5-aza-CdR and
HDACIs regulate TRAIL expression by different mechanisms.
Importantly, we have shown that 5-aza-CdR treatment increased
the half-life of TRAIL protein (Fig. 3C). This may explain why
induction of TRAIL is not in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A).

It has been shown that the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin can
induce TRAIL in the human colon cancer cell lines (38), and that
overexpression of the active form of Akt can abolish TRAIL
induction by wortmannin, suggesting that Akt plays a negative role
in TRAIL expression. Consistent with this, we have shown that
5-aza-CdR treatment results in a decrease in phosphorylated Akt,
which is correlated with induction of TRAIL (Fig. 4A). More
importantly, we have shown that overexpression of the active form
of Akt abolishes TRAIL induction by 5-aza-CdR (Fig. 4B). Because
active Akt phosphorylates its downstream targets, including GSK3,
to initiate its function, it is expected that inhibition of GSK3
activity might affect TRAIL induction. Indeed, we have shown that
the GSK inhibitors Ro-318220 and LiCl can inhibit TRAIL induction
by 5-aza-CdR (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our results strongly suggest
that 5-aza-CdR–induced TRAIL is through suppression of the Akt
pathway.
Although 5-aza-CdR itself can inhibit cancer cell growth, recent
studies suggested that 5-aza-CdR could serve as a sensitizer to
enhance the anticancer activity of the conventional anticancer
drugs. It has been shown that 5-aza-CdR induces caspase-8 in both
neuroblastoma and Ewing tumor cells, and that induction of
caspase-8 by 5-aza-CdR sensitizes tumor cells to anticancer agents
including TRAIL, etoposide, and cisplatin (45, 46). Moreover,
a study suggested that 5-aza-CdR induces caspase-9 and subsequently sensitizes lung cancer cells to p53-induced apoptosis (26).
Induction of caspase-9 by 5-aza-CdR also sensitized lung cancer
cells to cisplatin and paclitaxel (26). Thus, activation of either death
receptor or mitochondrial pathway is likely the mechanism
underlying its sensitization. In this study, we have shown that
cotreatment of the human breast cancer cell line MDA-231 with
5-aza-CdR and Adriamycin results in a significant activation of
caspase-8, which was not obvious in cells treated with either
5-aza-CdR or Adriamycin alone (Fig. 1C), indicating that 5-aza-CdR
sensitizes MDA-231 cells to Adriamycin, and that activation of

caspase-8 involves in this sensitization. Because activation of
caspase-8 can result from activation of death receptors, it is likely
that the death receptor pathway is activated in this combined
treatment. Consistent with this, we showed that TRAIL is induced

upon 5-aza-CdR treatment. Because activation of the TRAIL
pathway can induce apoptosis, it is expected that activation of
the TRAIL pathway by 5-aza-CdR can activate caspase-8 and
caspase-3 and induce apoptosis. Although 5-aza-CdR can induce
TRAIL, it is possible that such induction is not relevant to this
sensitization. Through down-regulation of TRAIL expression by
siRNA silencing, we found that 5-aza-CdR–mediated sensitization
is abrogated (Fig. 5B), suggesting TRAIL is indeed involved in this
sensitization. However, we could not exclude the possibility that
other members of the apoptotic pathways, including caspase-8 or
caspase-9, are involved in this sensitization as indicated in previous
studies (26, 45). Thus, our data suggest that the enhanced effects of
the combination on cell death are attributable to the activation of
both the TRAIL death receptor apoptotic pathway by 5-aza-CdR
and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by Adriamycin, leading
to strong induction of apoptosis and cell death.
In summary, we show that 5-aza-CdR induces TRAIL via
inhibition of the Akt pathway. Furthermore, we show that the
treatments of breast cancer cells with 5-aza-CdR enhance
Adriamycin-induced anticancer activity via activation of both the
death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. More
importantly, we show that induction of TRAIL is critical for 5aza-CdR–mediated sensitization of breast cancer cells to Adriamycin because knockdown of TRAIL by siRNA silencing abrogates
such sensitization. Therefore, our results identify a novel mechanism by which the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-CdR sensitizes
the breast cancer cells to Adriamycin via inhibiting the Akt
pathway. Because both TRAIL and 5-aza-CdR are being tested in
clinical trials, their combination may provide therapeutic gain for
treating solid tumors.
