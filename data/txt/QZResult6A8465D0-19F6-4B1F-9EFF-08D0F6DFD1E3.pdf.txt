Abstract
This study examined possible mechanisms for hypoxiaincreased metastasis in a green fluorescent protein–labeled
human fibrosarcoma cell line (HT1080). The efficiency of the
lung arrest of tumor cells, which can be dependent on the
adhesive potential of the tumor cells, was assessed by
measuring the level of integrin A3B1 protein and by adhesion
assays, whereas the extravasation potential was examined by
an invasion assay. These properties were not changed by
exposure to hypoxia, indicating that lung arrest and extravasation are unlikely to play a major role in the effect of
hypoxia on metastasis in this model. The main effect of
hypoxic exposure was found to be increased survival after
lung arrest as determined by clonogenic assay of tumor
cells recovered from mouse lungs after i.v. injection. Concomitantly, apoptosis was identified as responsible for the death
of lung-arrested cells, suggesting the involvement of an altered
apoptotic response following hypoxic exposure of these cells.
Consistent with this finding, we found that the effect of
hypoxia on both increased metastasis and survival of arrested
cells was inhibited by treatment with farnesylthiosalicylic
acid. However, this effect was not due to down-regulation of
hypoxia-inducible factor-1A, a mechanism of action of this
drug reported by previous studies. Further detailed studies of
the mechanisms of action of the drug are needed. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Tumor hypoxia has been strongly associated with tumor
resistance to therapy and malignant progression such as increased
metastatic potential (1–3). For tumor cells to form metastases, they
have to intravasate into the circulatory system, survive the
mechanical shearing force in the circulation, arrest and survive
at the remote sites, and then initiate growth and continue to
proliferate (4, 5). Although the mechanisms involved in hypoxiaincreased tumor cell metastatic efficiency are still not completely
understood, studies have suggested that exposure to hypoxia may
have an effect on all these steps of the metastatic process. In
addition, hypoxia may also promote angiogenesis at primary sites
to produce new lymphatic and blood vessels that provide a route
for tumor cells to enter the circulation system.

Studies have shown that metastasis is an inefficient event and
that the mechanisms for the inefficiency can be cell type specific.
For example, in vivo video microscopy and cell fate analysis using
mouse melanoma B16F10 cells suggested that metastatic inefficiency is primarily due to regulation of the balance between tumor
cell growth and death at secondary sites; the failure of growth
initiation of arrested tumor cells plays an important role (4).
Studies using transformed rat embryo fibroblasts have shown that
apoptosis of lung-arrested tumor cells after i.v. injection is an early
event involved in metastatic inefficiency (6). Both experimental and
clinical studies have indicated that metastatic efficiency of tumor
cells can be associated with their resistance to apoptosis (7–9).
Because hypoxia can regulate cell growth through various
pathways (10), it is possible that hypoxia may affect metastatic
efficiency by modifying the balance between tumor cell death and
growth. Although direct evidence to support this hypothesis is
still needed, studies have shown that gene products, such as
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein up-regulated
by hypoxia, can act not only as an angiogenic factor but also as
a survival factor for some human tumor cells (11), and blocking
VEGF with neutralizing antibody has been reported to significantly
decrease metastatic efficiency of some human melanoma cell lines
(12, 13). Recently, lysyl oxidase (LOX) has been reported to be
essential in hypoxia-induced metastasis, and one of the postulated
mechanisms is to allow the growth and proliferation of tumor cells
at metastatic sites (14, 15).
Hypoxia-induced LOX can also modify tumor cell motility and
invasion; thus, it may increase tumor cell metastatic efficiency by
affecting both intravasation and extravasation (14). Other studies
have also reported that hypoxia may have an effect on intravasation
and extravasation by modulating tumor cell motility and invasion
potential through different mechanisms [e.g., through the regulation of protease activity on extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation;
refs. 1, 2]. Hypoxia can also enhance the expression of autocrine
motility factor, and by doing so increase motility of human
pancreatic cancer cells (16). In addition, exposure to 3% oxygen
was found to activate transcription of the Met proto-oncogene and
consequently to promote the invasive growth of the tumor cells
(17). Furthermore, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a protein
that can be induced by hypoxia through the stabilization of its
subunit HIF-1a, can regulate cell invasion in colon carcinoma (18).
Recently, it has been reported that hypoxia can stimulate
carcinoma invasion by stabilizing microtubules and by promoting
the Rab11 trafficking of integrin a6h4 (19).
Hypoxia may also affect tumor cell arrest at metastatic sites by
modifying their adhesion potential. Although it has been reported
that the arrest of tumor cells is a passive process due to the size
restriction of capillaries smaller than tumor cells, there is evidence
suggesting that cancer cells may undergo adhesive arrest in the

liver in precapillary vessels, when the endothelium has been
activated by the cytokine interleukin-1a (20). In addition, it has
been reported that certain types of tumor cells can be arrested in
lungs by attaching to relatively larger pulmonary blood vessels,
where the cells are unlikely to be trapped by size limitation (21).
This attachment is mediated through the interaction between
integrin a3h1 on tumor cells and laminin-5 in blood vessel
basement membrane (22). Integrins are proteins that have been
shown to play an essential role in cell adhesion to ECM and other
cells and to be involved in tumor progression (23). The expression
of some integrins can be regulated by hypoxia through the
induction of HIF-1 or the activation of extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase, thereby potentially modifying cellular adhesion (24–26).
These studies suggest that hypoxia might promote tumor cell arrest
by increasing tumor cell adhesion potential through the induction
of integrins to increase metastases.
In this study, we investigated mechanisms that may contribute
to hypoxia-enhanced metastasis using a green fluorescent protein
(GFP)–labeled human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cell line. We observed
that the main effect of hypoxic exposure on this cell line was
increased survival of cells in the lungs, suggesting that by
increasing tumor cell survival alone, hypoxia is able to enhance
tumor cell metastatic efficiency. This was further supported by
a finding that treatment with farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS) both
reduced metastatic efficiency in hypoxia preexposed cells and
inhibited the effect of hypoxia on tumor cell survival in lungs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and hypoxic treatment. HT1080-GFP cells were kindly
provided by Dr. Ruth Muschel (Radiobiology Research Institute, Churchill
Hospital, Headington, Oxford, United Kingdom). The cells were cultured in aMEM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For all experiments, 2  105 to 5  105 cells were
plated in 10-cm dishes and incubated in 5% CO2 and air at 37jC. To render cells
hypoxic, dishes were placed in a plastic chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) flushed
with a gas mixture of 5% CO2 and a designated percentage of O2 balance N2. It
took 3 to 6 h to achieve severe hypoxia (V5 mmHg) in medium when 0% O2 was
used. For reoxygenation, cells were incubated in a tissue culture incubator. The
average rate of oxygen increase was at f3 mmHg/min during the first 30 min of
reoxygenation. FTS was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.
Assays for experimental lung metastasis. Severe combined immunodeficient mice were housed in the specific pathogen-free colony of the
Ontario Cancer Institute under conditions approved by the Canadian
Council on Animal Care. For the lung colony assay, each mouse received
5  104 cells through the tail vein and was killed 28 days later. The lungs
were fixed in Bouin’s solution. The pulmonary tumors on the surface were
counted under a dissecting microscope. The number of injected viable
cells was determined using clonogenic assays. The plating efficiencies for
different treatment groups, which varied from 60% to 90%, were then used
to calculate metastatic efficiency.
Clonogenic assays for viability of lung-arrested tumor cells. For the
viability assay of the arrested tumor cells, 106 or 105 cells per mouse were
injected i.v. To prepare lung single-cell suspensions, the lungs were
removed, minced, and incubated in 4.5 mL PBS, 0.5 mL 0.05% trypsinEDTA (Invitrogen), and 150 Kunitz units/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) for
30 min at 37jC with agitation, and then the tissue pieces were incubated
in a-MEM medium containing 0.25% collagenase type 4 (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 300 Kunitz units/mL DNase I for 1 h at 37jC with agitation. The cells
were dispersed by shaking and then passed through a 40-Am cell strainer
to collect a single-cell suspension. A total of 5  104 lung-derived cells
were plated into a 10-cm tissue culture dish. Colonies were counted 10 days
later.

Plating efficiency assay. Tumor cells from the same population as i.v.
injected cells or cells for other assays were plated at 100 tumor cells/10-cm
tissue culture dish. The colonies formed on dishes were fixed, stained, and
counted at 10 days later to determine plating efficiency.
Western blot analysis. Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in
0.5 to 1.0 mL lysis buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 1%
Triton X-100, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
100 mmol/L NaF, 10 mmol/L NaP2O7, freshly added protease inhibitors].
The lysates were scraped into tubes, incubated on ice for 1 h, and then
centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm and 4jC to collect the supernatant.
Whole-cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and
transferred to a Hybond enhanced chemiluminescence nitrocellulose
membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The antibodies used were polyclonal
anti–integrin a3, anti–integrin h1, anti–h-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.), anti–phospho-ERK1/2, anti–phospho-Akt (Cell Signal Technology),
and anti-tubulin (Abcam) and monoclonal anti-MDM2 (Oncogene/Calbiochem), anti-p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti–HIF-1a (Abcam). The
hybridization and detection were done according to the instructions from
the antibody manufacturers.
Invasion assay. Invasion assays were done using a Cell Invasion Assay
( fluorometric) kit (Chemicon). Cells were harvested and resuspended in
medium (2% FBS) at 5  105 cells/mL. An aliquot of the cell suspension
(250 AL) was added to inserts coated with a matrix of reconstituted
basement membrane proteins (ECMatrix). Complete medium was added as
chemoattractant into a 24-well plate (500 AL/well), in which the coated
inserts were placed. At 24 and 48 h of incubation, the cells that had invaded
through the inserts were detached and lysed, and a CyQuant GR Dye was
added. The fluorescence intensity was measured with a SpectraFluor Plus
plate reader (Tecan) using 485/535 nm filter set.
Adhesion assay. Cell adhesion potential was tested using an IntegrinMediated Cell Adhesion kit, a CytoMatrix Screen kit (Chemicon), or 96-well
plates coated with laminin-5 (Biodesign) at 2 Ag/mL overnight. Cells were
harvested and resuspended in complete medium at 5  105 cells/mL. An
aliquot of the cell suspension was added to a coated well (100 AL/well of
a 96-well plate). The cell number and incubation time were determined in
preexperiments. After 2 h of incubation at 37jC in a cell culture incubator,
the plate was rinsed three times with PBS containing 1 mmol/L Ca2+
(200 AL/well), stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 10% ethanol, and rinsed
again, and the dye was extracted into a mixture of 50 AL of 0.1 mol/L
NaH2PO4 (pH 4.5) and 50 AL of 50% ethanol. The absorbance at 560 nm was
measured as aforementioned.
Proliferation (WST-1) assay. Cells (1  103–5  103) were seeded into a
96-well plate and cultured under normal or hypoxic conditions. On the day
of the assay, 10 AL/well of the WST-1 labeling solution (EMD Biosciences)
were added. After 2 h of incubation at 37jC in a cell culture incubator, the
absorbance was measured as aforementioned at 450 nm with the reference
wavelength 620 nm.
Immunohistochemistry. A total of 106 cells per mouse were injected i.v.
The lungs were removed and fixed in formalin and later embedded in
paraffin. The paraffin-embedded lungs were cut into 4-Am-thick sections,
dewaxed, dehydrated, and microwave heat treated for epitope retrieval.
Sections were treated with a protein blocker (Signet Labs) before incubating
with antibody to GFP (Abcam), Ki67 (DAKO), or cleaved caspase-3 (Cell
Signaling). The sections were then incubated for 30 min each with
biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) and horseradish
peroxidase–labeling reagent (ID Labs). The incubations were all at room
temperature. Reaction products were revealed by 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine,
counterstained, and mounted in Permount (Fisher). For double staining, the
images were immediately captured using a ScanScope scanner (Aperio
Technologies), and then the coverslips and mounting medium were
removed to do second round staining. Alkaline phosphatase-streptavidin
(Vector Laboratories) and a freshly prepared Vector red solution (Vector
Laboratories) were used to reveal reaction products.
Real-time quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy
Miniprep kit (Qiagen). For quantitative PCR, 2 Ag of total RNA were reverse
transcribed using an OmniScript kit (Qiagen), and 1 AL of the reverse
transcription products was mixed with PCR primers, double-distilled water,

and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) to a total volume of
12 AL. The reaction condition was as follows: 95jC for 10 min and 40 cycles
of 95jC for 15 s and 60jC for 60 s. The reactions were run and analyzed
with an ABI Prism 9700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems).
Statistics. The t test (two tailed) was done for comparisons between two
groups. Kruskal-Wallis statistic or ANOVA was used to detect significant
changes among multiple groups followed by Dunn’s test for multiple
comparisons against one single control group.

Results
Hypoxia pretreatment increased experimental metastatic
efficiency in HT1080-GFP cells. Severe chronic hypoxia (5% CO2
and 95% N2, 24 h) pretreatment significantly increased (P < 0.025)
experimental lung metastatic efficiency in HT1080-GFP cells by
3- to 4-fold (Fig. 1A). Reoxygenation for 6 to 18 h showed a trend
for further increase, but it was not statistically significant
compared with that of groups without reoxygenation. After 24 h
of reoxygenation, the metastatic efficiency started to return toward
control level. At 48 h of reoxygenation, the metastatic efficiency
was similar to that of normoxic control groups.
Because tumor cells exposed to chronic anoxia or severe hypoxia
in a solid tumor may lie far from functional vasculature, and thus
may be unable to contribute significantly to the development of
metastasis, we examined the effect of hypoxia on tumor cell
metastatic efficiency at higher oxygen concentrations. As shown in
Fig. 1B, the lung experimental metastatic efficiency was increased
in response to a wide range of low oxygen preexposure at
concentrations from 0% to 2%, with the largest increase occurring
at 0.2% oxygen (P < 0.01 for 0.2% versus 0% and P < 0.05 for 0.2%
versus 2%), although the difference between 0.2% and 1% oxygen
treatments was not statistically significant. The concentration of
0.2% O2 was used in all subsequent experiments. Figure 1C shows
that HT1080-GFP cell viability was not significantly changed after
hypoxia treatment as tested by clonogenic assay.
Hypoxic exposure did not affect adhesion or invasion
potential in HT1080-GFP cells. Previously, we showed that
hypoxia increased metastasis in a mouse fibrosarcoma cell line
(KHT-C) by up-regulating Mdm2 and suppressing p53 activity (27).
However, this mechanism does not explain hypoxia-enhanced
metastatic efficiency in the human fibrosarcoma cell line (HT1080).
As shown in Fig. 2A, p53 protein level was increased by hypoxia.
The accumulation of MDM2 protein, a target gene of p53
transactivity, was observed in HT1080-GFP cells after 5 Gy of
ionizing radiation even with hypoxia pretreatment, suggesting
that hypoxia may induce, rather than suppress, p53 activity in this
cell line.
Because previous studies using this HT1080-GFP cell line have
shown that lung metastasis can originate from the proliferation of
endothelium-attached tumor cells and that the vascular attachment of these tumor cells rather than size limitation was observed
as the mechanism of lung arrest (21), we investigated whether
hypoxia was able to increase the adhesion potential of these cells.
First, we examined the expression level of a3h1 integrin after
hypoxia treatment, based on the observation by Wang et al. (22)
that lung arrest of the HT1080-GFP cells was mediated through an
interaction between a3h1 integrin on tumor cells and laminin-5 in
exposed pulmonary base membranes. We did not detect any
change of integrin a3 or h1 expression in HT1080-GFP cells after
hypoxia treatment with or without reoxygenation (Fig. 2B).
In addition to integrin a3h1, other integrins can also play
important roles in cell adhesion and may be regulated by hypoxia

www.aacrjournals.org

(25, 28). Furthermore, hypoxia can increase cell adhesion by
activating integrins through a mechanism that does not involve the
regulation of integrin expression at either mRNA or protein level
(24). Thus, we did adhesion assays to test cell adhesion potential
using antibodies to various integrins and using different ECM
proteins, including fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, collagen-1,
and collagen-4. The tested integrins (integrin avh3, integrin avh5,
and all h1-containing integrins) have been shown to play important
roles in mediating cell adhesion to ECM (22–25). Figure 2C (top)
shows that hypoxia pretreatment, with or without reoxygenation,
did not change HT1080-GFP cell adhesion potential mediated by
any one of the integrins. There was also no difference observed
between normoxic and hypoxia-pretreated HT1080-GFP cells with
or without reoxygenation in their adhesion to ECM proteins,
including fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, collagen-1, and collagen-4 (Fig. 2C, bottom). Finally, the adhesion of HT1080-GFP cells
to laminin-5 was not affected by hypoxia (please see below). Taken
together, these data suggested that hypoxia did not change
adhesion potential of HT1080-GFP cells.
Extravasation is another step in the metastatic cascade that can
be potentially modulated by hypoxia (5). Because at the time of
extravasation, tumor cells are usually exposed to normal physiologic oxygen concentration, an invasion assay on tumor cells
pretreated with hypoxia was done under normoxic conditions to
mimic the effect of hypoxia on tumor cell extravasation. Normoxic
or hypoxic cells that migrated through the ECMatrix-coated inserts
were quantified at 24 and 48 h after seeding. The numbers of
migrated cells were normalized against the plating efficiencies of
oxic or hypoxia-pretreated cells seeded directly in tissue culture
dishes and is presented as relative fluorescence units in Fig. 2D. In
this assay, the number of the cells migrated through the coated
inserts is dependent on both ECM degradation and cell motility,
the combination of which determines the efficiency of tumor cell
extravasation. Again, no difference was detected between control
and hypoxia-pretreated HT1080-GFP cells at both time points,
suggesting that hypoxia did not affect tumor cell invasion in this
model. Although the oxic or hypoxia-pretreated cells had been
grown for 24 and 48 h on ECM-coated inserts and might have
proliferated, the proliferation rates of these cells are unlikely to
cause any change in the number of migrated cells because no
significant difference in proliferation rates was observed between
oxic and hypoxia-pretreated HT1080-GFP cells (Fig. 3C).
Hypoxia pretreatment increased the survival of lungarrested HT1080-GFP cells. Experimental and clinical studies
indicate that metastatic potential can be associated with tumor cell
resistance to apoptosis in certain types of tumors (6–8, 29–31).
Furthermore, our previous studies showed that hypoxia can
increase metastatic efficiency by inhibiting an apoptotic response
in KHT-C and SCC VII cells (27). Thus, we investigated the effect of
hypoxia on survival of HT1080-GFP cells arrested in mouse lungs.
Similar to previous results in KHT-C cells, apoptotic cell death was
observed in lung-arrested HT1080-GFP cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting a
role of apoptosis in the death of HT1080-GFP cells after lung arrest.
Clonogenic assays on cells derived from lungs of mice injected
i.v. with tumor cells showed that more clonogenic tumor cells were
recovered from the lungs of mice injected with hypoxia-pretreated
tumor cells than from those injected with normoxic control cells
(105 or 106 cells/mouse injected; Fig. 3B). In addition, this increase
is likely due to a better survival rather than enhanced proliferation
of hypoxia-pretreated cells because a large difference in proliferation rate would be required to explain the big difference observed.

Cancer Research

Furthermore, hypoxia did not promote cell proliferation in this cell
line (Fig. 3C), and at 24 h after injection, the tumor cells are
unlikely to have undergone significant proliferation. This was
further confirmed by Ki67 immunohistochemistry staining on
sections of lungs removed from mice at 24 h after tumor cell injection. As shown in Fig. 3D, Ki67-positive staining was not correlated
with GFP-positive staining ( for HT1080-GFP cells) in mouse lungs
at 24 h after injection of oxic or hypoxia-preexposed HT1080-GFP
cells, suggesting that the injected tumor cells did not initiate
proliferation in mouse lungs during the first 24 h after injection.
FTS inhibited the effect of hypoxia on tumor cell survival
and lung experimental metastasis. Blum et al. (32) reported that
a Ras inhibitor FTS inhibited the phosphorylation but not the total
amount of Akt or ERK protein and down-regulated HIF-1a at the
protein level by inhibiting the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) pathway, causing cell death in glioblastoma cells,
suggesting that it could potentially be used as a cancer therapeutic
agent targeting HIF-1a activation. We tested whether FTS was able
to block the effects of hypoxia on the HT1080-GFP cells. We
observed that FTS treatment was able to inhibit the effect of
hypoxia on increased experimental metastatic efficiency (Fig. 4A).
Surprisingly, FTS treatment of the cells during hypoxic exposure
inhibited hypoxia-induced VEGF but not hypoxia-induced carbonic
anhydrase 9 (CA9) or LOX (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, Fig. 4C shows
that the accumulation of HIF-1a was not correlated with Akt
activation. This suggests that the mechanism of the action of FTS

is unlikely to be through inhibition of HIF-1a accumulation by
targeting the Akt/mTOR pathway. Further investigation showed
that the phosphorylation of Akt or ERK was not changed by
hypoxic exposure alone or by FTS. Reoxygenation was required for
Akt activation, and this activation was inhibited by FTS (Fig. 4C
and D); however, these changes were not observed in ERK
phosphorylation. Because HIF-1a has a very short half-life under
oxic condition, the accumulation of HIF-1a was observed only in
cells treated with hypoxia without reoxygenation (Fig. 4C) and it
was not inhibited by FTS treatment (Fig. 4D), suggesting that other
mechanisms and/or transcription factors may be involved in the
inhibitory effect of the drug on hypoxia-increased metastases in
HT1080-GFP cells.
To determine the role of tumor cell survival after lung arrest in
hypoxia-increased metastasis, we further tested whether FTS could
affect the survival and adhesion potential of HT1080-GFP cells. FTS
treatment did not affect the in vitro viability of either oxic or
hypoxic HT1080-GFP cells (Fig. 5A) nor did it inhibit the adhesion
of oxic or hypoxic cells to laminin-5 (Fig. 5B, top) or to some other
ECM proteins (Fig. 5B, bottom). However, if the cells were treated
with FTS during hypoxic exposure and then injected i.v. into mice,
the hypoxia-enhanced survival of lung-arrested cells was inhibited,
whereas no effect was observed in FTS-treated normoxic cells
(Fig. 5C). These data support the linkage between the effect of
hypoxia on the survival of lung-arrested tumor cells and hypoxiaincreased experimental metastatic efficiency.

Figure 1. Hypoxia pretreatment increased the metastatic efficiency of HT1080-GFP cells. HT1080-GFP cells were grown under control conditions or pretreated
with hypoxia and various periods of reoxygenation and then injected i.v. into animals to generate lung colonies. An in vitro clonogenic assay was done on the same cell
populations to determine the number of actual viable cells injected, and the plating efficiency determined (C ) was used to calculate metastatic efficiency. The
metastatic efficiency shown is the mean from four independent experiments, and five mice were used per group for each experiment. The error bars represent SEs.
A, the cells were grown under oxic control conditions (CON ) or anoxic conditions for 24 h without reoxygenation (0) or reoxygenated for 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h
(6, 12, 18, 24, and 48) before i.v. injection. B, the cells were grown under oxic control conditions (CON ) or hypoxic conditions for 24 h (H24 ) at designated oxygen
concentrations (0%, 0.2%, 1%, or 2%), and then the cells were injected i.v. without reoxygenation. C, cells from the same populations as in (A and B) were
plated at 100 cells per dish to determine the plating efficiencies of HT1080 cells after different hypoxia and reoxygenation treatments. *, P < 0.025, Kruskal-Wallis

Effect of Hypoxia on Metastasis and Cell Survival in Lungs

Figure 2. The effect of hypoxia on HT1080-GFP cell adhesion potential. HT1080-GFP cells were cultured under normal oxic conditions or exposed to hypoxia
(0.2% O2) with or without reoxygenation before the cells were harvested or the assays were done. A, HT1080-GFP cells were irradiated with 5 Gy, and protein
was harvested from nonirradiated cells or irradiated cells at 3 and 5 h after irradiation. The protein levels of p53 and MDM2 were examined using immunoblotting
analysis. h-Actin was probed as a loading control. The numbers under each band are the relative intensity versus the nonirradiated control band corrected to this
loading control. B, the cell lysates were harvested from cultured HT1080-GFP cells grown under oxic conditions (CON ), exposed to hypoxia for 24 h (H24 ), or 24 h
of hypoxic exposure followed by 24 h of reoxygenation (H/O ). The protein levels were examined using Western blot analysis. CA9 was used as a positive control for
hypoxia treatment and h-actin as a loading control. Results shown are representative of three separate experiments. C, for adhesion assays, the cells were collected
after growth under oxic conditions (CON ), 24 h of hypoxic exposure (H24 ), or 24 h of hypoxic exposure followed by 24 h of reoxygenation (H24/O24). Top, cells
were counted and then seeded into 96-well plate format stripes coated with antibodies that recognize integrin avh3 (a5b3 ), integrin avh5 (a5b5 ), and all h1-containing
integrins (b1). Noncoated stripes were used as negative controls. Bottom, cells were seeded into plates coated with different ECM proteins, including fibronectin,
vitronectin, laminin, collagen-1, and collagen-4. Bovine serum albumin (BSA)–coated stripes were used as negative controls. A total of 5  104 cells per well were seeded
and incubated at 37jC for 2 h as being optimized by preexperiments to ensure that the number of the attached cells is within the linear range. The number of seeded
viable cells was determined by clonogenic assay and used for normalization. The number of the cells attached to the wells was determined by staining the attached
cells and then extracting the dye into a solution to measure the absorbance. Data presented were corrected according to plating efficiency and were the average
of four repeats. Columns, absorbance; bars, SE. D, for invasion assays, HT1080-GFP cells were cultured under oxic control condition (CON ) or pretreated with
hypoxia (0.2% O2) for 24 h (H24 ) before the cells were collected for the invasion assay. The cells were counted and seeded into the inserts containing ECMatrix-coated
membrane and incubated under normal tissue culture conditions. A clonogenic assay was done on control or hypoxic cells that were from the same populations to
determine the actual numbers of seeded viable cells (plating efficiency) from both control and hypoxia-pretreated groups at the time of the assay. The number of the cells
that invaded through the ECMatrix-coated membrane at 24 and 48 h was determined by staining the cells with a fluorescent dye and then measuring the fluorescence
intensity. The data were normalized according to plating efficiency and are the average of four repeats. Columns, relative fluorescence units (RFU ); bars, SE.

Discussion
It has been well shown that most solid tumors grow in a
unique microenvironment characterized by an abnormal vascular
structure, which leads to an insufficient supply of oxygen and

nutrients to tumor cells. Tumor hypoxia is a consequence of this
abnormal vasculature and promotes tumor malignant progression
such as increased metastasis (1, 2). A better understanding of
the mechanisms involved in the hypoxia-induced increase in

metastatic disease is needed to improve the outcome of patients
with hypoxic tumors. This study investigated the effect of hypoxia
on various stages of metastatic process using a GFP-labeled human
fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080. We found that increased survival of
tumor cells under secondary stress conditions after hypoxic
exposure may be enough to cause increased metastases. More
importantly, by inhibiting the enhanced tumor cell survival, the
hypoxia-increased metastatic efficiency was prevented.
Another important biological event involved in metastatic growth
is angiogenesis. Angiogenesis can be stimulated by hypoxia through
the induction of growth factors such as VEGF. In a primary tumor,
angiogenesis may provide escape routes for dissociated tumor cells,
thereby promoting intravasation. At later stages of metastatic
progression, angiogenesis is required to sustain the growth of
micrometastases to develop into clinically detectable macrometa-

stases (4, 33). However, the effect of hypoxia on angiogenesis and
intravasation is unlikely to play a role in the increased lung colonies
observed in this study because tumor cells were injected i.v. into
mice, and also the effect of hypoxia on lung metastasis in this cell line
is transient and lost after 48 h of reoxygenation (Fig. 1A).
Angiogenesis is unlikely to be required at this early stage. For the
same reason, other mechanisms that affect intravasation, for example
hypoxia-regulated expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator
or matrix metalloproteinases (1), are unlikely to be involved.
The results in this study are consistent with our previous
findings in a murine fibrosarcoma cell line KHT-C (27), in which we
showed that lung-arrested KHT-C cells underwent apoptosis and
that the altered response of KHT-C cells to apoptosis, which
involves hypoxia-induced up-regulation of Mdm2 and the consequent inhibition of p53 activity, can contribute to increased

i.v. into each mouse. A clonogenic
assay was done on cells from the same
populations to ensure that similar numbers
of viable control and hypoxic cells were
injected. The number of viable HT1080GFP cells recovered from lungs was
determined by clonogenic assay. The
proportions of viable HT1080-GFP cells
recovered at different times were
normalized against the number of viable
cells recovered at 30 min after i.v. injection.

Figure 4. The effect of FTS on HT1080GFP cell metastatic efficiency. HT1080GFP cells were cultured under normoxic
control conditions (CON ) or treated with
hypoxia (0.2% O2) for 24 h (H24 ). FTS was
added while the cells were exposed to
hypoxia for the duration of 24 h and then
removed by changing medium right after
the cells were returned to oxic conditions
for the following assays. A, 5  104 cells
treated with FTS or nontreated cells were
injected per mouse to generate lung
colonies. The metastatic efficiency for each
experiment was calculated using the
average number of lung colonies in five
mice to normalize against the actual
number of injected viable cells determined
by plating efficiency of the cells before
injection. Columns, mean of the metastatic
efficiencies from four independent
experiments; bars, SE. B, the mRNA
expression level of VEGF, LOX, or CA9

Data were normalized against the

metastatic efficiency. Apoptosis was also observed to occur in the
lung-arrested HT1080-GFP cells, and hypoxia pretreatment increased the survival of these cells (Fig. 3), indicating apoptotic
potential as an important mechanism involved in the effect of
hypoxia on tumor metastatic progression in this model. However,
the molecular mechanisms involved are likely to be different in
these two models because activation rather than suppression of
p53 by hypoxia was observed in HT1080-GFP cells (Fig. 2A).
Further studies are needed to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the HT1080-GFP model. Equally, the importance
of the hypoxia-induced increase in lung survival also needs to be
investigated in different types of tumor cells to determine whether
it is a cell type specific effect of hypoxia.
An interesting and clinically relevant aspect of these results is
that the increased metastatic efficiency can be due to enhanced
survival potential achieved by altered response to apoptosis, which
may confer resistance to radiotherapy and some chemotherapies
(34). More importantly, this can occur after up to 24 h of
reoxygenation (Fig. 1A). The existence of hypoxic tumor cells thus
may contribute to both the failure of local control and the
increased incidence of metastatic disease. Moreover, these effects
are transient, suggesting that long-term hypoxic exposure to select
for mutants is not required. Thus, it could be easier for the tumor
cells to acquire this transient more aggressive phenotype. This
model therefore may provide a useful tool to study and test for

www.aacrjournals.org

the efficacy of new therapeutic regimens to target the malignant
progression promoted by hypoxia.
In this context, the potential use of FTS to inhibit the effect of
hypoxia on tumor cells was tested. FTS has been reported to be a
Ras-dislodging antagonist through the inhibition of Ras methylation, which is one of the Ras post-translational modifications
required for its membrane localization (35). FTS has been shown to
inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in several different tumor
types by blocking Ras downstream pathways (32, 36–39). As a
promising agent for cancer therapy in tumors with mutant
activated Ras, FTS may also have the additive benefit of controlling
hypoxia-induced tumor progression due to the important role of
Ras activation in hypoxia-regulated gene expression. For example,
hypoxia-dependent up-regulation of osteopontin, which is linked to
malignant progression in several tumor sites, has been reported to
be mediated by a Ras-activated enhancer in NIH-3T3 cells (40, 41).
The inhibition of Ras by FTS has been shown to cause cell death,
possibly through the down-regulation of HIF-1a, in glioblastoma
cells (32). Other hypoxia-inducible transcription factors have also
been reported to be mediated by Ras downstream pathways, such
as nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB; refs. 42, 43) and activator protein-1
(AP-1). Furthermore, some hypoxia-regulated genes that are
important in tumor malignancy may be regulated by more than
one transcription factor (44). One example is VEGF, which can be
regulated by HIF-1 (45), NF-nB (46), Egr1 (47), and AP-1 (48).

Figure 5. The effect of FTS on HT1080-GFP cell survival and adhesion potential. HT1080-GFP cells were cultured under normoxic control conditions (CON ) or treated
with hypoxia (0.2% O2) for 24 h (H24 ). FTS was added while the cells were exposed to hypoxia for the duration of 24 h and then removed by changing medium right
after the cells were returned to oxic conditions for the following assays. A, the viability of FTS-treated or nontreated cells was determined by clonogenic assay. Columns,
average of plating efficiencies from four independent experiments; bars, SE. B, the adhesion assays were done as described previously on normoxic control (C ) or
hypoxic (H ) cells with or without FTS. The tested ECM proteins were laminin-5 (top ) and fibronectin (F ), vitronectin (V ), laminin (L), collagen-1 (C1 ), and collagen-4
(C4) (bottom ). FBS was used as a blank control. Data were corrected according to the plating efficiency of the cells from the same cell populations. Columns, average
of three independent experiments; bars, SE. C, 105 control or hypoxic cells treated with 25 Amol/L FTS (+FTS) or nontreated cells were i.v. injected into
mice. The lungs were removed at 30 min or 24 h after the injection to make lung single-cell suspensions. The number of viable tumor cells recovered from the lungs was
determined by clonogenic assay and normalized by the plating efficiency of the cells before injection. Columns, average of eight mice from two independent
experiments; bars, SE. **, P < 0.01, treated versus control.

Therefore, to achieve a better control of hypoxia-induced tumor
progression, Ras activation can potentially be an effective target.
However, whether or how Ras activation may be involved in
hypoxia-increased metastatic efficiency in HT1080-GFP cells still
needs to be determined.
The data in Figs. 4 and 5 show that FTS successfully inhibited the
hypoxia-induced increase in tumor cell survival and metastatic
efficiency in HT1080-GFP cells, but no effect was observed on oxic
cells, suggesting that this inhibitory effect of FTS on metastatic
efficiency is by targeting hypoxia-induced proteome changes in this
cell line, at least at the tested concentrations. Despite this finding,
our initial studies show no evidence for an effect of FTS on downregulation of HIF-1a in hypoxic HT1080 cells (Fig. 4D). Thus, a
much more detailed investigation of the mechanisms of action of
FTS in HT1080-GFP cells is needed. Currently, we are investigating
the involvement of other Ras downstream pathways, such as p38
and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathways, which have also been
shown to regulate cell apoptosis (49, 50). The FTS inhibition of
hypoxia-upregulated VEGF also merits further study. The potential
clinical use of FTS as an antimetastatic agent needs to be further
studied to determine if it can inhibit metastases by oxic tumor cells
at different concentrations.
Overall, although hypoxia has been reported to modify many
aspects of tumor cell behavior that may be important in the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (16). August 15, 2007

metastatic process, we have shown that they are not all required
for hypoxia to increase metastatic efficiency using human
fibrosarcoma HT1080-GFP cell line. By promoting the survival of
arrested cells alone, hypoxia is able to promote metastatic
progression. These results provide important guidelines for
developing new therapeutic strategies. For example, metastasis
can originate intravascularly from the proliferation of these tumor
cells attached to the endothelium without the need for
extravasation (21); therefore, targeting tumor cell invasion alone
may not be effective to control metastatic progression in patients
with similar tumors. This study confirms that a transient
alteration in the apoptotic response of cells can play an important
role in metastasis formation. This aspect needs to be considered
in the development of cancer therapies targeting metastatic
development.
