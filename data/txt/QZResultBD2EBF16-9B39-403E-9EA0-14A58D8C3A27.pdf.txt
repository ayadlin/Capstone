ABSTRACT
Overall survival (OS) with the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor (ALKi)
crizotinib in a large population of unselected patients with ALK-positive non-smallcell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not documented. We sought to assess OS with crizotinib
in unselected ALK-positive NSCLC patients and whether post-progression systemic
treatments affect survival outcomes.
ALK-positive NSCLC patients receiving crizotinib in French expanded access
programs or as approved drug were enrolled. We collected clinical and survival data,
RECIST-defined progressive disease (PD) and post-PD systemic treatment efficacy.
We performed multivariable analysis of OS from crizotinib initiation and PD under
crizotinib.

At time of analysis, 209 (65.7%) of the 318 included patients had died. Median
OS with crizotinib was 16.6 months. The line of crizotinib therapy did not impact
survival outcomes. Of the 263 patients with PD, 105 received best supportive care, 74
subsequent drugs other than next-generation ALKi and 84 next-generation ALKi. Nextgeneration ALKi treatment correlated with better survival outcomes in multivariate
analysis. These patients had a median post-PD survival of 25.0 months and median
OS from metastatic disease diagnosis of 89.6 months.
Unselected ALK-positive NSCLC patients achieve good survival outcomes with
crizotinib therapy. Next-generation ALKi may provide survival improvement after PD
under crizotinib.

EMA following crizotinib failure [13, 14]. Alectinib is
also effective in crizotinib-pretreated patients (response
rate: 48-55%; PFS: 8.1-8.9 months) and FDA approved
[15–17]. Other promising next-generation ALKis are
under clinical investigation [18, 19]. Given their efficacy,
a potential survival benefit associated with using nextgeneration ALKi following crizotinib failure has been
suspected, though not yet proven, in comparison with
other systemic treatment options [20–22].
The IFCT-1302 CLINALK study sought to evaluate
OS under crizotinib in a large unselected population of
ALK-positive NSCLC patients. We also aimed to examine
the different systemic treatments’ effect on survival
following crizotinib and whether next-generation ALKis
improve survival outcomes in this setting.

INTRODUCTION
The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is
rearranged in approximately 5% of non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) cases, leading to constitutive activation
of the ALK tyrosine kinase domain and tumorigenesis
[1, 2]. Crizotinib is an inhibitor of ALK kinase activity
that has demonstrated its superiority over conventional
chemotherapy in advanced ALK-positive NSCLC [3,
4]. Crizotinib was compared to standard first-line and
second-line chemotherapy in two randomized Phase III
trials (PROFILE 1014 and PROFILE 1007), achieving
higher response rates and a significantly longer median
progression-free survival (PFS) [3, 4]. It is now approved
worldwide for treating advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.
The estimation of overall survival (OS) with
crizotinib has not yet been fully documented. A
retrospective analysis comparing 30 crizotinib-treated
ALK-positive NSCLC patients to 23 crizotinib-naïve ones
reported longer OS in the former (1-year OS: 70% vs.
44%; 2-year OS: 55% vs. 12%, respectively) [5]. In the
PROFILE 1007 trial comparing crizotinib to pemetrexed
or docetaxel as second-line following platinum-based
regimen failure, an updated survival analysis showed a
median OS with crizotinib at 21.7 months but identified
no difference in OS between the crizotinib arm and
chemotherapy arm, probably due to a cross-over in the
chemotherapy arm [6]. Another limitation comes from the
restrictive inclusion criteria implemented in clinical trials,
meaning any benefit observed in a selected population
might not reflect that in daily practice.
Most patients experience progressive disease (PD)
within one year of crizotinib initiation [3, 4]. Locallyablative treatment could extend disease control with
crizotinib in oligoprogressive disease [7, 8], and continuing
crizotinib beyond PD (CBPD) might favourably impact
survival outcomes [9]. Anecdotal clinical response to
crizotinib rechallenge has been reported [10, 11]. The
efficacy of conventional chemotherapy is debatable as very
little clinical data is available after crizotinib failure [12].
Next-generation ALK inhibitors (ALKis) can
overcome resistance to crizotinib. Ceritinib has proven
efficacious in crizotinib-pretreated patients in a dose
escalation Phase I trial (response rate: 56%; median PFS:
6.9 months), and has been approved by both FDA and

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
In total, 318 patients were selected for data
collection and analysis (Figure 1). Of them, 214 met the
inclusion criteria in the French crizotinib expanded access
program (EAP) database. Following EAP discontinuation,
104 additional ALK-positive patients treated with
crizotinib as second-line approved drug were enrolled.
Table 1 presents the patients’ characteristics on
initiating crizotinib. Half were male, the median age was
under 60 years old, and the majority had never smoked
and presented with adenocarcinomas. One third exhibited
brain metastasis, and 77.3% PS 0 or 1.
One hundred seventy-two patients (54.1%) received
crizotinib as second-line treatment, 16 (5.0%) were treated
in the front-line setting, 59 (18.6%) in third-line, and 71
(22.3%) in fourth- or further-line setting. The mean time
from diagnosis of advanced disease to initiating crizotinib
treatment was 13.9 months (95% CI: 12.4-15.5). Platinumand pemetrexed-based chemotherapy were administered
before crizotinib to 277 (91.7%) and 244 (80.8%) patients,
respectively.

Crizotinib efficacy
Disease progression was observed in 284 patients
(89.3%) by the time of data cut-off. The median PFS under

crizotinib was 6.8 months (95% CI: 5.6-8.3). Of the 267
evaluable patients, one complete response (0.4%) and 133
partial responses (49.8%) were reported for an ORR of
50.2% (95% CI: 44.2-56.2). The DCR was 74.9% (95%
CI: 69.7-80.1). At time of the analysis, 39 patients were
still receiving crizotinib.

receive subsequent treatments after crizotinib, the 21
patients who died under crizotinib were not considered
for the survival analysis of systemic treatments following
progression on crizotinib. Finally, a population of 263 with
documented progressive disease was considered.
The sites of progression are provided in
Supplementary Table 1, including 99 cases (37.6%) of
cerebral progression, regardless of the extra-cerebral
status. There were 136 (51.7%) oligoprogressive diseases,
60 (44.1%) of which occurred in the brain.
CBPD was documented in 86 patients (32.7%).
The median duration of CBPD was 6.6 months (range:
0.7-35.2). The baseline characteristics and progression
patterns of CBPD and non-CBPD patients are provided
in Table 3. Patients under 65 years, with PFS on crizotinib
≥median, cerebral progression, and oligoprogression were
more common in the CBPD population. This population
was more commonly treated with next-generation ALKis
following disease progression. The median OS from the
first crizotinib dose was significantly longer in CBPD
patients than in non-CBPDs (32.2 months [95% CI: 25.4NR] versus 11.2 months [95% CI: 8.4-12.9]; log rank p
<0.0001), as was median post-PD survival (18.7 months
[95% CI: 15.1-26.9] versus 4.0 months [95% CI: 3.0-5.6];
log rank p <0.0001).
The drugs administered as first-line and secondline post-crizotinib are shown in Table 4 (full details in
Supplementary Table 2). The next-generation ALKis
administered were ceritinib for 57 patients, alectinib for
19, ceritinib then alectinib for five, ceritinib then lorlatinib
in one, and alectinib then ceritinib in two. Crizotinib
was rechallenged in nine (3.4%). Chemotherapy was
combined with ALKis in eight. Twenty patients received
unmonitored subsequent systemic treatment after second-

Analysis of overall survival with crizotinib
We lost 14 patients (4.4%) to follow-up. By the time
of the analysis, 209 patients (65.7%) had died. The median
duration of follow-up was 44.4 months (95% CI: 40.647.5). The median OS from diagnosis of metastatic disease
was 30.9 months (95% CI: 26.7-34.5).
The median OS from first crizotinib dose was
16.6 months (95% CI: 12.2-19.6) (Figure 2). The 6- and
12-month survival rates were 73.4% (95% CI: 68.578.3) and 56.2% (95% CI: 50.7-61.7), respectively. After
adjusting for potential confounding factors, multivariable
Cox regression (Table 2) revealed former- or never-smoker
status on crizotinib initiation, adenocarcinoma histology,
and PS 0-1 to be significantly associated with decreased
risk of death. Median OS was significantly longer for
patients with PS 0-1 than those with PS 2-4 (19.5 months
[95% CI: 16.5-25.0] versus 4.5 months [95% CI: 3.0-7.3],
log rank p <0.001). The line of crizotinib therapy did not
impact OS (Table 2).

Effect on overall survival of systemic treatments

other than next-generation ALKi.
In order to analyse the effect different systemic
treatments have on survival following progression
on crizotinib, the patients were separated into three
groups: best supportive care (BSC) only (n=105, 40%),
subsequent drugs other than next-generation ALKis (n=74,
28.1%), and next-generation ALKis (n=84, 31.9%). The
characteristics at baseline and time of disease progression
are provided in Table 5. Patients receiving BSC only
were older, had poorer PS, were heavily pretreated, and
more frequently exhibited PFS on crizotinib <median
than those receiving subsequent drugs. Patients receiving
next-generation ALKis were younger, more frequently
exhibited PFS on crizotinib ≥median, more frequently

received CBPD, and more frequently exhibited cerebral
progression than patients receiving subsequent drugs other
than next-generation ALKis.
Median post-PD survival was 6.5 months (95% CI:
5.3-9.8). Multivariable Cox regression (Table 6) revealed
that next-generation ALKis and CBPD were associated
with improved survival from the first crizotinib dose, as
well as improved post-PD survival, as were baseline PS
0-1, PFS with crizotinib ≥median, cerebral progression,
and oligoprogression. Subsequent treatment other than
next-generation ALKis did not improve survival. BSC
only was associated with worse survival from the first
crizotinib dose and worse post-PD survival.
For patients receiving next-generation ALKis,
median OS from the first crizotinib dose was not reached

59.2% (95% CI: 46.4-72.1), respectively. Post-PD survival
was significantly longer for patients receiving nextgeneration ALKis than either those receiving subsequent
drugs other than next-generation ALKis or those receiving
BSC only (25.0 months [95% CI: 18.6-NR] versus 6.4
months [95% CI: 5.1-10.2] versus 1.5 [95% CI: 0.8-2.1],
log rank p=0.0002) (Figure 3B).
The median OS from diagnosis of metastatic disease
was 89.6 months (95% CI: 53.5-not reached) for patients
receiving next-generation ALKi and significantly longer
than either those receiving subsequent drugs other than
next-generation ALKi (28.2 months [95% CI: 22.1-33.0])
or those receiving BSC only (19.6 months [95% CI: 15.124.5]) (log rank P<0.001) (Figure 3C).

NSCLC primarily pretreated with first-line platinumbased regimens. Additionally, our analysis of systemic
treatments following disease progression on crizotinib
suggests that next-generation ALKis substantially prolong
survival after crizotinib failure in comparison with other
treatment strategies.
We report a median OS of 16.6 months after
initiation of crizotinib, which is slightly shorter than
the previous estimation of 21.7 months reported by
the PROFILE 1007 trial evaluating crizotinib in the
second-line setting. This could be the result of selecting
patients in clinical trials compared to all-comer patients
treated in daily practice. Our patients were older, less

not impact survival outcomes on crizotinib in our study.

Systemic treatment after

54% of the patients in PROFILE 1007 [4]. A non-Asian
ethnicity-related negative effect on outcome could not be
excluded [23].
Current smoking at time of crizotinib initiation
had a strong negative effect on survival outcomes. ALK
rearrangement is detected in higher proportions in nonsmokers and former smokers [1]. Very few current
smokers were enrolled in clinical trials with crizotinib,
meaning little is known about crizotinib efficacy in this
patient subset [3, 4]. The current-smoker population
could consist of those with very poor prognosis and a
specific biological pattern, explaining the lack of efficacy
of crizotinib. Furthermore, cigarette smoking induces
cytochromes CYP1A1/1A2 and is hypothesized to alter
anti-EGFR erlotinib pharmacokinetics, resulting in
worse clinical outcomes [24, 25]. Crizotinib elimination
via CYP1A1/1A2 has not been reported, yet our data
suggests cigarette smoking has a potential impact on its
pharmacokinetics [26, 27]. Nevertheless, only 29 patients
were current smokers at time of crizotinib initiation in our
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

study. Our results warrant validation in a larger cohort. On
the other hand, PS 2-4 at time of crizotinib initiation was
associated with worse survival with crizotinib and after
disease progression. This suggests that ALKis should be
given to ALK-positive patients as soon as possible in the
disease course.
CBPD was associated with remarkably similar
survival outcomes to those previously reported by Ou et
al. [9]. CLINALK and Ou et al. studies reported median
OS with crizotinib of 32.2 and 29.6 months in the CBPD
population and 11.2 and 10.8 months in non-CBPD,
respectively [9]. The similar survival benefit we observed
with CBPD in two independent cohorts, and persistence of
this benefit following adjustment for the different systemic
treatment strategies initiated after disease progression on
crizotinib, confirm the validity of this approach, previously
legitimised by the lack of effective and well-tolerated
drugs available for strategies following crizotinib failure.
Next-generation ALKis have emerged as the preferred
treatment in this setting due to their ability to overcome
21912

crizotinib resistance. In our study, they deeply impacted
survival outcomes when given after disease progression on
crizotinib, whereas other systemic treatments did not and,
as expected, BSC only was associated with worse survival.
Given its retrospective nature, this survival analysis
had several limitations. We included patients receiving
crizotinib at different times in their disease course, in
second- or third-line in 72.7% of the cases. The survival
analysis focused on three non-randomized and unmatched
groups of patients according to systemic treatment
received after disease progression on crizotinib. As a
result, the characteristics of these three groups are partially
imbalanced, with biases in patient selection potentially
causing the improved survival observed in those receiving
CBPD or next-generation ALKis. Alternatively, this could
also be due to specific tumour biology and high sensitivity
to ALK inhibition, rather than a direct effect of treatment
strategies. Patients received next-generation ALKis as
clinical trial participants, all with good prognosis. Finally,
locally-ablative treatments in cases of oligoprogressive
disease were not recorded, potentially causing a partial
bias in our results.
Nevertheless, we provide an estimation of
survival  benefit with next-generation ALKis adjusted

for potential confounding factors, including patterns
of progression on crizotinib and CBPD, compared to
a population treated with systemic treatments other
than next-generation ALKis or BSC only. A recently
published retrospective analysis of 73 patients treated with
crizotinib then ceritinib reported a 49.4-month OS from
diagnosis of metastatic disease, though did not provide a
comparator population [20]. Two smaller studies with 11
and 13 patients treated with crizotinib then reported good
survival outcomes [21, 22]. In our study, the 84 patients
receiving next-generation ALKis after crizotinib achieved
an 89.6-month OS from diagnosis of metastatic disease,
with a 59.2% 3-year survival from the first crizotinib
dose and median post-PD survival of 25.0 months.
The survival rates reported here in a large population
treated with crizotinib then next-generation ALKis could
represent an interesting benchmark for ongoing clinical
trials assessing how best to sequence the available ALKis.
The ALEX trial (NCT02075840) is comparing crizotinib
and alectinib in first-line setting with no crossover at time
of progression. In contrast, the NCI ALK Master Protocol
(NCT02465060) will compare in first-line a standard
treatment arm with crizotinib to several next-generation

ALKis and evaluate different sequential strategies by
incorporating systematic crossover in each treatment arm.
In conclusion, the prolonged survival observed
in crizotinib clinical trials in ALK-positive NSCLC can
also be observed in less selective patient populations
treated in routine practice. The remarkable median
survival from diagnosis of metastatic disease of 89.6
months reported in patients treated with next-generation
ALKis after crizotinib emphasizes the importance of
accelerated access to diagnostic tools and targeted therapy
in molecularly-defined populations. While this study was
unable to resolve the question of how best to sequence
ALKis, it could provide a rationale that supports the use
of sequential ALKis rather than non-targeted treatment
after crizotinib failure, along with offering an historical
benchmark for the ongoing clinical trials in this setting.

for over 21 days following RECIST-defined PD and best
response to crizotinib other than PD. First-line and secondline drugs following crizotinib failure and corresponding
response according to RECIST 1.1. were monitored.
Crizotinib rechallenge was defined as crizotinib initiation
following at least one systemic therapy following PD
under crizotinib [28].
The primary end-point was OS measured from
the date of first crizotinib dose. Secondary endpoints
included: objective response rate (ORR) according to
RECIST 1.1, evaluated by investigators; disease control
rate (DCR); PFS, according to RECIST 1.1.; OS from PD
under crizotinib (post-PD survival); OS from diagnosis of
metastatic disease.

Study oversight
This non-interventional study was conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good
Clinical Practice guidelines, approved by a national ethics
committee, French Advisory Committee on Information
Processing in Material Research in the Field of Health,
and France’s national data protection authority (CNIL).
All participating departments approved the study protocol.
All included patients still alive received information from
their referring physician.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population and procedures
This retrospective study included only patients
with diagnosis of ALK-rearranged NSCLC determined
by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH, performed
on a routine basis at certified molecular genetics French
National Cancer Institute [INCa] platforms using a
certified break-apart FISH assay), with advanced/
metastatic NSCLC, aged ≥18 years, not enrolled in a
crizotinib trial, having received at least 7 days of crizotinib
treatment. All received 250mg oral crizotinib twice daily
at initiation.
The French crizotinib expanded access program
(EAP) enrolled 313 patients exhibiting any ALK-positive
tumours from November 18th 2010 to October 23th 2012.
The EAP database was provided by Pfizer. Of the 117
identified investigational centres, 80 agreed to participate.
After EAP discontinuation, we enrolled patients receiving
second-line crizotinib as approved drug until December
31th 2013 at participating centres.
Data and survival follow-up were extracted from
medical records by investigators in each centre and
documented in a standard case report form. Database is
held by the French Collaborative Thoracic Intergroup
(IFCT) that ensured the quality of the data collected by
monitoring the centres via periodic visits of IFCT clinical
research associates. Medical monitoring was performed
by two co-authors (MD, DMS). The source documents
proving the collected data’s integrity are filed at the
investigational centre.

Statistical analysis
Variable characteristics were compared with the
chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests for qualitative variables
and Student’s t-test or ANOVA for quantitative variables.
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate all OS
endpoints. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) using a Cox model. Univariate
Cox models were applied to select the most promising
prognostic variables (threshold p=0.20). A multivariate
Cox model was then applied using a backwards procedure
to adjust for potential confounders. OS was defined as the
date of first crizotinib dose to death or final follow-up.
Post-PD survival was defined as the date of RECISTdefined PD under crizotinib to death or final follow-up.
The cut-off for survival analysis was July 31st 2015.
All statistical tests were two-sided, and a p value <0.05
was deemed statistically significant. All analyses were
performed using SAS software, Version 9.3 (SAS
Institute).
