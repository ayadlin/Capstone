BACKGROUND: The authors demonstrated previously that the combination of topotecan (TPT) and carboplatin
(CBP) was more effective than current chemotherapeutic combinations used to treat retinoblastoma in an orthotopic
xenograft model. However, systemic coadministration of these agents is not ideal, because both agents cause doselimiting myelosuppression in children. METHODS: To overcome the toxicity associated with systemic TPT and CBP,
the authors explored subconjunctival delivery of TPT or CBP in an orthotopic xenograft model and in a genetic
mouse model of retinoblastoma (Chx10-Cre;Rblox/lox;p107/;p53lox/lox). The effects of combined subconjunctival CBP
(CBPsubcon) and systemic TPT (TPTsyst) were compared with the effects of combined TPTsubcon and CBPsyst. at clinically relevant dosages. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic and tumor-response studies, including analyses of ocular and hematopoietic toxicity, revealed that CBPsubcon/TPTsyst was more effective and had fewer side effects than TPTsubcon/
CBPsyst. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, retinoblastoma was ablated and long-term vision was preserved in a
mouse model by using a clinically relevant chemotherapy regimen. These results eventually may be translated into a

Retinoblastoma is the third most common cancer in infants1; approximately 250 to 300 cases are diagnosed
annually in the United States. Advances made in noninvasive focal therapies combined with chemotherapy have transformed retinoblastoma management since the 1990s. With early detection, the survival probability is approximately 90%
in developed countries; in developing countries, it is only about 50%. The objective of retinoblastoma treatment is to preserve vision without compromising long-term survival while minimizing side effects. Enucleation still is common in the
eye with the most advanced disease in patients who have bilateral disease.
Patients with retinoblastoma have not benefited fully from advances in drug development and local delivery methods, in part because few preclinical models faithfully recapitulate the human disease. Animal models are essential for
studying retinoblastoma, because there are too few patients for large-scale clinical trials.2 The recent development of
several rodent models of retinoblastoma may facilitate advances in the treatment of bilateral retinoblastoma.3,4 By using
an orthotopic xenograft model of retinoblastoma, we demonstrated previously that the combination of topotecan
(TPT) and carboplatin (CBP) delivered systemically (TPTsyst and CBPsyst) was more effective than the current standard
of care (combined etoposide, vincristine, and CBP).4 Unfortunately, coadministration of these agents causes intolerable
toxicity in children.5

Two approaches make possible the coadministration
of these agents with minimal side effects: First, administer
the drugs at different times and closely monitor blood
counts to ensure that myelosuppression does not reach
dangerous levels. The limitation of this approach is that
tumor cells are exposed to only 1 agent at a time. Second,
administer 1 drug locally to the eye and the other systemically to minimize toxicity. Abramson and colleagues were
the first to demonstrate that the subconjunctival administration of CBP (CBPsubcon) (20 mg per eye) was a feasible
treatment for retinoblastoma.6 Indeed, retinoblastoma is
ideal for local delivery of chemotherapy, because the eye is
readily accessible, and high intraocular concentrations can
be achieved with lower systemic exposure. Although both
drugs could be administered simultaneously by subconjunctival injection, we do not favor this approach for several reasons1: The subconjunctival space holds a finite
volume; thus, if 2 drugs are combined, then the concentration of each must be reduced.2 Subconjunctival
injections typically are performed only under anesthesia
during examinations, which occur every 3 weeks. If 1 drug
is delivered systemically over the course of several days,
then the tumor will be exposed to that agent for a longer
time.
In the current study, we compared the effectiveness
of the CBPsubcon/TPTsyst combination with the effectiveness of the TPTsubcon/CBPsyst combination. Pharmacokinetics were analyzed to determine which agent was
better suited to subconjunctival injection. Toxicity and
tumor-response experiments also were done to guide
future trials. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive preclinical study of our established knockout mouse model
of retinoblastoma.7 All diagnostic tests and assessments
done in children with retinoblastoma were done in the
mice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture and Viability
Y79 and Weri1 cells were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va), and RB355
cells were obtained from Brenda Gallie. Retina cells were
maintained in RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum.8 The Y79-Luc cell line has been described previously.4 To compare the sensitivities of retinoblastoma
cell lines to different chemotherapies, we exposed each
cell line to 14 concentrations (0.004-60 lM) of each
drug for 0.5 hours, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, or 72
hours. The viability of each cell line was determined with

422

the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Assay Kit (Promega, San
Luis Obispo, Calif). The luminescent signals were read
by an Envision Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, Mass).
Genetic Mouse Model of Retinoblastoma,
Orthotopic Rat Xenografts, and
Fluorescent Imaging
We used the previously described Chx10-Cre;Rblox/lox;
p107/;p53lox/lox mouse model of retinoblastoma.7 For
xenograft studies, newborn Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles
River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass) received an intravitreal injection of 1000 Y79-Luc cells, as described previously.4 After approximately 2 weeks, the animals were
injected intraperitoneally with D-luciferin (100 mg/kg).
and image were obtained 30 minutes later using a Xenogen IVIS 200 system and Living Image Software version 2
(all from Caliper LifeSciences, Hopkinton, Mass). Tumor
burden is directly proportional to the photons/cm2 per
second detected with the Xenogen imaging system.9 Once
tumor burden reached 106 photons/cm2 per second, animals were used in the pharmacokinetic studies.
Pharmacokinetic Studies
Two-week-old rats were treated with TPT (10 lg per eye;
GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) or CBP
(100 lg per eye; Bristol-Myers Squibb, NY, NY). At serial
time points (0 hours, 0.25 hours, 0.5 hours, 1.5 hours, 4
hours, and 6 hours), a cardiac puncture was performed,
blood was collected, and plasma was isolated. Then, animals were killed by cervical dislocation, the eyes were
removed, the vitreous was collected and flash frozen, and
the retinas were harvested, rinsed in saline to remove
excess drug, and flash frozen.
Total TPT (lactone plus carboxylate) was quantified
by using a sensitive, specific reversed-phase, isocratic
high-performance liquid chromatography.10 The method
was linear from 0.25 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL, and the
lower limit was 0.25 ng/mL. For CBP, the concentration
of total platinum in supernatants was quantified using
flameless atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin Elmer
AAnalyst 600 atomic absorption spectrometer with Zeeman background correction to measure platinum content) after diluting the matrix in water containing 0.2%
(volume/volume) Triton X-100 and 0.06% (weight/volume) cesium chloride.
An appropriate pharmacokinetic model was fit to
the TPT or CBP plasma or to the vitreous concentrationversus-time data using ADAPT software version 5.0.0

(Biomedical Simulations Resource, Los Angeles, Calif).11
Areas under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUCs)
of 0 to 6 hours for TPT or CBP plasma and for vitreous
were calculated using parameter estimates and the loglinear trapezoidal method.
Intraocular Pressure Measurements
The intraocular pressure (IOP) of sedated mice was measured with the TonoLab Rebound Rodent Tonometer
(TonoLab, Espoo, Finland). The device was held so that
the probe was 1 mm to 4 mm from the cornea, and 6
measurements were taken and averaged. IOP measurements were taken before subconjunctival injection and
then at 1 day, 2 days, and 7 days thereafter.
Visual Acuity
Visual acuity was measured using the OptoMotry System
(CerebralMechanics, Inc., Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada)
as described previously.12 All tests were performed under
bright-light conditions to measure cone function. At least
2 consecutive measurements were taken 24 hours before
and after drug administration.
Complete Blood Counts
To assess the hematopoietic toxicity of TPT and CBP,
standard complete blood counts with differential (CBCDs) were obtained on Day 0 and on Day 6 or Day 10
postinjection, depending on treatment. Blood (30 lL)
was collected from the facial vein and mixed with 30 lL
ethanol. Samples were processed immediately using the
FORCYTE Hematology Analyzer (Oxford Scientific,
Oxford, Conn).
Digital Retina Camera
The initial diagnosis and staging of retinoblastoma were
obtained with a Kowa retinal camera (Tokyo, Japan) that
was reconfigured with a 70-diopter lens for use with
mouse eyes. To observe the retina, whiskers were
trimmed, and the pupil was dilated with 1% tropicamide.
Ultrasound
The Vevo 770 system (VisualSonics, Toronto, Ontario,
Canada) was used for ultrasound measurements of retinoblastoma tumors. Mice were sedated with isoflurane (2%3% in O2) and positioned on the Vevo platform. Ultrasound gel (Aquaphora) was applied to the surface of the
eye, and a 708-Hz probe was used for B-mode image
acquisition.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were obtained using
a 7-T Bruker Clinscan animal MRI scanner (Bruker
BioSpin MRI GmbG, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped
with Bruker 12s gradient (BGA12S) and a 4-channel
phase-array surface coil placed on the mouse’s head.
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (as described
above) for the duration of data acquisition. Threedimensional, magnetization-prepared rapid gradient
echo (TR, 2500 msec; TE, 2.5 msec; TI, 1050 ms) was
used to produce T1-weighted images (0.5-mm coronal
slices) with a matrix of 256  146 and a field of view of
30  20.6 mm. The initial images were read on a Siemens work station using Syngo MR B15 software (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and reviewed with MRIcro
software (version 1.4; freeware developed by Chris Rorden; www.mricro.com).
Ocular Histopathology
Eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at
4 C, dehydrated through an alcohol series, and washed
in xylene. Then, the eyes were embedded in paraffin,
and 5-lm sagittal sections were cut through the optic
nerve. The corneas, ciliary epithelia, retinas, and optic
nerves of untreated eyes were compared with those of
treated eyes 1 day, 2 days, and 7 days after subconjunctival injection.
Statistical Methods
Significant changes in CBC-D values and blood chemistry
tests were calculated with GraphPad software (GraphPad
Software Inc., La Jolla, Calif) using t tests. Survival curves
were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and a
log-rank test was used to compare the curves.

RESULTS
Pharmacokinetics of Subconjunctival
Injection of Carboplatin or Topotecan
Phase I clinical trials have demonstrated that CBPsubcon6
or TPTsubcon13 are well tolerated as single agents in
patients with retinoblastoma. To determine the extent of
intraocular penetration and systemic exposure of each
drug after subconjunctival administration in our rodent
models, we performed pharmacokinetic experiments in
juvenile 2-week-old rats, as described previously.4 TPT
(10 lg per eye) and CBP (100 lg per eye) were administered as bilateral injections. On the basis of the

rats after subconjunctival injections of either drug in both eyes (CBP, 100 lg per eye; TPT, 10 lg per eye). (C,D) In a similar experiment that was performed in tumor-bearing animals, plasma and vitreous were harvested at similar time points, and the concentration-versus-time plots were used to fit a 2-compartment model to determine the area under the concentration-versus-time

proportional volume of human eyes versus rat eyes, these
doses were similar to those used in children.6,13
The vitreous, plasma and retinas were harvested at
several time points up to 6 hours after TPTsubcon or
CBPsubcon, the drug concentration was measured in each
tissue, and the AUCs were calculated from the model
parameters. Both agents efficiently penetrated the
vitreous (Fig. 1A,B; Table 1). The AUC ratio
(AUCvitreous/AUCplasma) was 1.98 for TPT and 0.85 for
CBP, suggesting that TPT penetrated the vitreous more
efficiently.
Next, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of
TPTsubcon or CBPsubcon in tumor-bearing juvenile rats to

424

determine whether the presence of a rapidly growing
tumor in the vitreous altered the pharmacokinetic profiles
of these drugs. The vitreal penetration of CBP was not
altered dramatically (AUCvitreous/AUCplasma ratio, 1.26)
(Fig. 1C, Table 1). However, the vitreal penetration of TPT
increased 3-fold in the presence of tumor (AUCvitreous/
AUCplasma ratio, 6.12) (Fig. 1D, Table 1). For both drugs,
subconjunctival injections resulted in greater vitreous exposure than systemic injections (Table 1).4
To measure drug exposure in the contralateral,
untreated eye after a single subconjunctival injection, we
performed pharmacokinetic analyses as described above.

Cytotoxicity in Retinoblastoma Cell Lines
To establish a target systemic exposure for dosing in our
preclinical models, we tested the cytotoxicity of 3 human
retinoblastoma cell lines (Y79, Weri1, and RB355) to
TPT and CBP. The starting cell density for each line was
determined empirically by measuring the growth of cells
after 72 hours in 384-well culture dishes to ensure that
they were within the linear range for the Promega CellTiter-Glo Assay (data not shown). The 90% inhibitory
concentration (IC90) in Y79 cells after TPT treatment was
approximately 0.2 lM (Fig. 2A); Weri1 and Rb355 cells
were more sensitive, with IC90 values of 0.1 lM and 0.05
lM, respectively (Fig. 2B,C). A similar trend was
observed for CBP (Fig. 2A-C).
Next, we determined the duration of exposure (at
0.5 hours, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, or 72 hours) to the
IC90 values of TPT and CBP needed to achieve maximum
cytotoxicity in each line. The cells were maintained for 72

hours, and cell viability was measured (Fig. 2D-F). Ninety
percent cytotoxicity was achieved in each cell line after
approximately 8 hours of exposure to TPT (0.05-0.2 lM)
(Fig. 2D-F), and CBP (70-200 lM) had a similar trend
when we used the estimated IC90 values from the AUCs
in Figure 2 (see Fig. 2A-C). Although these values were
not equivalent to AUCs, they approximated the minimal
sustained levels of CBP or TPT required to kill a significant proportion of retinoblastoma cells in the vitreous.
The AUCs for vitreal exposure (AUCvitreous) for
each agent using each route of administration were used
to determine a ratio of the 2 drugs that would be achieved
with each approach. The AUCvitreous for TPTsyst (2 mg/
kg) was 1.02 lM per hour, which was equivalent to 0.102
lM per hour for the dose of 0.2 mg/kg used in our animal
studies. The AUCvitreous for CBPsubcon (100 lg per eye)
was 53.6 lM per hour. Therefore, the ratio in the vitreous
when CBPsubcon/TPTsyst was administered was 0.1 lM
TPT/53 lM CBP; when the methods of delivery were
reversed, the ratio was 2.27 lM TPT/165 lM CBP.
Clearly, these concentrations were not achieved in the vitreous (Fig. 1), but the overall exposure ratio was reflected

in these numbers. To determine whether 1 ratio was
more effective than the other and to guide our tumorresponse experiments, we performed a dose-response analysis using these 2 ratios. Each ratio had substantial toxicity
across the concentration ranges achieved in the vitreous
(Fig. 3).
Tumor Response to Subconjunctival Injection
of Topotecan or Carboplatin
To test whether TPTsubcon/CBPsyst and CBPsubcon/
TPTsyst elicited different tumor responses, we performed
a tumor-response experiment using our rat xenograft
model. The animals were divided randomly divided into
3 groups: saline, TPTsubcon (10 lg per eye)/CBPsyst (10
mg/kg), and CBPsubcon (100 lg per eye)/TPTsyst (0.2 mg/
kg daily for 5 days). The drugs doses used in this study
recapitulates those used in clinical trials as closely as possible, taking into account species-specific toxicity (calculations available upon request). In the saline-treated group,
the tumor burden increased by approximately 50-fold to
100-fold (Fig. 4A); and, for the treated groups, it
decreased by approximately 10-fold (P < .01) compared
with the saline-injected group after 7 days (Fig. 4B,C).
Examples of an untreated rat and a treated rat (CBPsubcon/
TPTsyst) with corresponding histopathology are provided

received this combination, no animals survived past Day
5 of chemotherapy.
Ocular Toxicity After Subconjunctival
Injection of Topotecan or Carboplatin
We randomly assigned 12 C57Bl/6 mice into 3 groups:
untreated, salinesubcon (10 lL per eye), unilateral TPTsubcon
(10 lg per eye), and unilateral CBPsubcon (100 lg per eye)
and assessed ocular toxicity (ie, inflammation and
other periocular side effects) 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days
thereafter. No ocular toxicity was associated with any
injection (Fig. 5A). We also monitored the animals for
elevated IOP and impaired visual acuity but observed no
evidence of change in either measure at any time point
(Fig. 5B,C).
Then, we combined subconjunctival injections with
systemic administration to determine whether ocular
toxicity was caused by exposure of eye structures to the
agents. By using 3 C57Bl/6 mice per group in 2 groups,
we compared the ocular toxicity, visual acuity, and IOP in
animals that received TPTsubcon (10 lg per eye)/CBPsyst
(18 mg/kg) or CBPsubcon (100 lg per eye)/TPTsyst (0.1
mg/kg). After 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days, we observed no
difference in any measure for any group (data not shown).

Myelosuppression and Dehydration
Associated With Subconjunctival Topotecan
and Systemic Carboplatin

Next, we examined drug-induced, systemic toxicity. By
using seven 8-day-old rats, we administered CBPsubcon
(100 lg)/TPTsyst (0.2 mg/kg daily for 5 days) to mimic
the TPT dose administered to children with retinoblastoma. Body weights were measured daily for 9 days and
compared with those of untreated littermates; no significant weight loss was detected (Fig. 6A). Blood samples
drawn on Days 0 and 10 revealed no reduction in CBC-D
measures after treatment (data not shown).
In a similar set of experiments with the delivery
of agents reversed and at clinically relevant doses (ie,
TPTsubcon 10 lg per eye/CBPsyst 34 mg/kg), the juvenile
rats could not tolerate the treatment (data not shown).

428

When we reduced the CBP dose to 10 mg/kg, 3 of 6 animals survived to Day 6 of treatment but exhibited signs of
profound dehydration (ie, significant weight loss, lethargy, and tenting of the skin; data not shown) (Fig. 6A).
Blood chemistries obtained from the surviving rats on
Day 6 were normal except for an elevated blood urea
nitrogen level, consistent with chemotherapy-related
dehydration (Fig. 6B). In addition, CBC-D measures
were consistent with myelosuppression, as evidenced by
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (Fig. 6C). These data
indicate that TPTsubcon/CBPsyst is significantly more toxic
than the reverse treatment delivery in juvenile rats.

of administration. (A) The first group received saline injections, the second group received subconjunctival CBP (CBPsubcon) (100
lg per eye)/systemic TPT (TPTsyst) (0.2 mg/kg daily for 5 days), and the third group received TPTsubcon (10 lg per eye)/CBPsyst
(10 mg/kg daily for 5 days). Body weights were measured each day for the subsequent 9 days. When TPTsubcon/CBPsyst was
administered, all animals died with signs of dehydration by Day 6. (B) Blood chemistry results from treated and untreated juvenile rats are shown. Each bar represents the mean  standard deviation of measures from 2 or 3 animals. BUN indicates blood

received TPTsyst (0.1 mg/kg). The animals then had 2
weeks off therapy to complete the 3-week course. Tumors
were monitored by digital retinal camera, ultrasound, and
MRI (Fig. 7B); and IOP, visual acuity, and CBC-D were
measured. If the tumor progressed during treatment in 1
eye but the other eye was favorable, then surgical enuclea-

study according to the predetermined schedule. Of the 42
eyes from 22 animals in this study, 2 had a complete
response, 11 had stable disease, and 29 had disease progression (Fig. 7C, Table 3). The period required for 50%
of the animals to reach moribund status, which was

Figure 7. These charts illustrate the longitudinal study of subconjunctival carboplatin (CBPsubcon) and systemic topotecan
(TPTsyst) administration in a genetic model of retinoblastoma. (A) In a genetic mouse model of retinoblastoma Chx10-Cre;Rblox/lox;
p107/;p53lox/lox, mice developed aggressive and invasive retinoblastoma with 90% moribundity by age 250 days. Starting at age 6
weeks, the animals were screened for tumors. Once the baseline tumor was established, their chemotherapy trial was initiated. Each
course included a single dose of CBPsubcon (100 lg per eye) on Day 1 and TPTsyst (0.1 mg/kg) on Days 1 through 5 of the 21-day
course. Around Day 20 or 21, complete blood counts with differential (CBC-D), visual acuity, and intraoccular pressure (IOP) were
measured, and retinal images were acquired. RetCam indicates retinal camera. (B) These are representative images of an eye without
detectable retinoblastoma and from an untreated eye with retinoblastoma before to the study. If left untreated, then tumors filled the
vitreous, as observed on ultrasound and on a magnetic resonance image (MRI). (C) These are histograms of tumor response after 6
courses of CBPsubcon/TPTsyst in which (Left) 0.1 mg/kg TPT was administered. (Right) When this combination included the clinically
relevant area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC)-guided dose of TPT (0.7 mg/kg), the response improved. The time to
moribund status for treated animals was significantly longer (P<.0001) than that for the 8 untreated animals that were monitored in
parallel. (D) Visual acuity (in cycles per degree [c/d]) is illustrated in an untreated animal that rapidly worsened as the tumor progressed. In treated eyes from 2 independent readings, vision was preserved for at least 189 days in 1 animal (A10-69) and was
restored after 130 days in another animal (A13-3).

defined by imminent ocular rupture because of tumor filling the eye, increased from 60 days in untreated mice to
125 days in treated mice (Fig. 7C).
Next, we tested the higher, clinically relevant, AUCguided dose of 0.7 mg/kg TPTsyst on the same schedule in
combination with CBPsubcon. We treated 44 animals (80
eyes) for 4 courses. To date, 43% (19 of 44 animals) had a
complete response and are long-term survivors (>270
days) (Fig. 7C). Both doses of TPT were associated with a
significant improvement in outcome (P < .0001).

Remarkably, vision was restored or preserved in 73% of
the animals that had a complete response after CBPsubcon/
TPTsyst (Fig. 7D).

DISCUSSION
Retinoblastoma is unique among pediatric solid tumors,
because locally delivered and systemically administered
chemotherapy can be combined to optimize intraocular
drug exposure while minimizing the side effects associated

with combination chemotherapy. We tested the feasibility, efficacy, and toxicity associated with this approach
and observed that the CBPsubcon/TPTsyst combination
resulted in greater efficacy and fewer side effects in juvenile rats with orthotopic xenografts. No ocular side effects
were detected after acute exposure or repeated dosing on a
clinically relevant schedule. Then, these findings were
validated in a longitudinal study of six 3-week courses
administered to a knockout mouse model of retinoblastoma. For the first time to our knowledge, we ablated retinoblastoma in mice, and vision was restored in some
long-term survivors. Although these data are promising
for stopping retinoblastoma in vivo in a genetic model of
retinoblastoma, we still do not know whether it will
provide any predictive power for improved outcome in
human retinoblastoma. Pharmacokinetic studies are
essential for determining the vitreal exposure and the relative plasma exposure for a given dose. This is particularly
important for the TPT/CBP combination; because, if the
systemic exposure of both drugs is too high, then doselimiting myelosuppression or other toxicities will develop.
Our pharmacokinetic studies resulted in several key findings: 1) Subconjunctival delivery of either agent efficiently
penetrated the eye, as indicated by the vitreal concentration of drugs; however, 2) the AUCvitreous/AUCplasma
ratios indicated that the intraocular penetration of TPT
was better than that of CBP.3 The presence of tumor in
the eye slightly increased the penetration of both drugs.4
Subconjunctival administration led to greater vitreal exposure than systemic administration of either drug.5 After
unilateral subconjunctival injection, the contralateral eye
revealed detectable vitreal exposure to the drug as a result
of its uptake into the circulation. These data indicate that
subconjunctival delivery of either drug is feasible for the
treatment of retinoblastoma. Visual acuity, IOP, and cytotoxicity analyses revealed no detectable ocular toxicity
associated with subconjunctival injection of either drug.
In addition, when combined with systemic exposure to
the other drug, no changes in ocular physiology or histology were observed.
In contrast, chemotherapy-related dehydration and
myelosuppression were major challenges in these studies
when a clinically relevant dose of TPTsubcon/CBPsyst
(TPT, 10 lg per eye; CBP, 34 mg/kg) was administered.
Even when the CBP dose was reduced to 10 mg/kg, the
animals developed signs of severe dehydration and myelosuppression. This was surprising, because no detectable
toxicity or side effects were observed when the delivery
methods were reversed despite similar tumor response.

We speculate that this was caused by the increased overall
exposure of the 2 agents with this route of delivery because
of the large dose of CBP used for systemic administration.
The important advantage of the CBPsubcon/TPTsyst combination is that TPT can be delivered on the ‘‘daily for
5 days’’ schedule that is used clinically. This approach provides continued chemotherapeutic exposure for several
days, which is not possible when the methods of delivery
are reversed, because TPTsubcon is administered only on
Day 1 of therapy.
Toxicity data from our orthotopic xenograft model
confirmed that the preferred drug delivery is CBPsubcon/
TPTsyst. Tumor response to TPTsubcon/CBPsyst beyond 5
days could not be monitored in the rats because of morbidity. The advantage of this model is that it is well characterized and standardized, and direct comparisons can be
made with previous studies of retinoblastoma4; the disadvantage is that only short-term studies can be conducted
because the tumors grow quickly. Thus, we combined
preliminary studies in this model with long-term studies
in our genetic mouse model.
We validated the feasibility of multiple 3-week
courses of CBPsubcon/TPTsyst to treat retinoblastoma by
using the Chx10-Cre;RbLox/Lox;p107/;p53Lox/Lox mouse
model. The animals received a comparable dose on the
same schedule used to treat patients with retinoblastoma.
CBC-D measures were closely monitored, and the mice
recovered well on the treatment regimen. Tumor response
was observed in a substantial proportion of the animals, as
measured by reduced tumor burden, recovery of vision,
maintenance of normal IOP, and long-term survival (up
to 1 year). At a subclinical dose of TPT (0.1 mg/kg),
treated animals fared better than untreated animals; however, long-term survival and restoration of vision were
achieved only at the clinically relevant, AUC-guided dose
(0.7 mg/kg). Periocular CBP can cause significant scar tissue in children with retinoblastoma. In our studies, we
did not observe any scar tissue in the mice; however, this
remains a significant challenge for subconjunctival delivery in patients. It may be possible to develop an alternative
delivery device to direct drug across the sclera without exposure to the subconjunctival tissue.
One important difference between our study and the
clinical treatment of retinoblastoma is that children with retinoblastoma also receive focal therapies, such as laser treatment. We propose that mice can tolerate CBPsubcon (20
mg per eye) combined with TPTsyst (0.7 mg/kg) for 6 3week courses using doses that are comparable to those used
previously to treat patients with retinoblastoma. More

preclinical drug studies in genetic and orthotopic xenograft
animal models of retinoblastoma.
