Abstract
Kisspeptin-10 (Kp-10), a decapeptide derived from the
primary translation product of KISS1 gene, has been reported
previously to be a key hormone for puberty and an inhibitor
for tumor metastasis via the activation of G protein–coupled
receptor 54. However, whether Kp-10 inhibits angiogenesis,
which is critical for tumor growth and metastasis and other
human diseases, is still unknown. Here we show that
Kp-10 significantly inhibits human umbilical vein endothelial
cell (HUVEC) migration, invasion, and tube formation, key
processes in angiogenesis. Using chicken chorioallantoic
membrane assay and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)–induced mouse corneal micropocket assay, we show
that Kp-10 inhibits angiogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, Kp-10
inhibits tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficient
mice xenografted with human prostate cancer cells (PC-3)
through inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, whereas Kp-10 has
little effect on the proliferation of HUVECs and human
prostate cancer cells. In deciphering the underlying molecular
mechanisms, we show that Kp-10 suppresses VEGF expression
by inhibiting the binding of specificity protein 1 to VEGF
promoter and by blocking the activation of c-Src/focal
adhesion kinase and Rac/Cdc42 signaling pathways in
HUVECs, leading to the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.

Introduction
Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from preexisting
vessels, is crucial for tumor growth and metastasis (1). Numerous
previous reports showed that it is effective to inhibit tumor growth
and metastasis by blocking tumor angiogenesis (2). Angiogenesis is
a complex process including endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), secreted from tumor cells and endothelial cells through
either autocrine or paracrine manner, is critical for all steps of
tumor progression, including tumor cell growth and angiogenesis
(3–5). VEGF expression is regulated by either hypoxia-dependent or

hypoxia-independent pathways. The high GC-rich motifs in the
proximal regions of VEGF promoter are regulated by transcriptional factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1; refs. 6, 7), suggesting that
Sp1 is implicated for the basal VEGF expression level in cells
(8–11). When VEGF secreted by tumor cells interacts with VEGF
receptor-2 in endothelial cells, VEGF receptor-2–binding c-Src
recruits and fully activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which in
turn stimulates downstream proteins such as Rho GTPases or
mitogen-activated protein kinases. Therefore, a decrease in VEGF
expression or inhibition of VEGF-mediated signaling pathways in
endothelial cells is important for the inhibition of tumor
angiogenesis (12).
Human KISS1 gene encodes a premature 145–amino acid
protein, which is proteolytically cleaved into polypeptides known
as kisspeptins, including Kp-54 (also called metastin), Kp-14, Kp-13,
and kisspeptin-10 (Kp-10; refs. 13–15). Kisspeptins were originally
identified as a metastasis suppressor in melanoma cells via binding
and activating their cognate receptor G protein–coupled receptor
54 (GPR54; refs. 14, 16–18). Further studies showed that loss of
KISS1 gene expression was correlated with increased metastasis
and/or tumor progression in a wide variety of tumor types,
including malignant pheochromocytoma, esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma, bladder tumor, ovarian, gastric, and pancreatic
tumors (19–29). On the other hand, an increase in KISS1 and
GPR54 expression with high-grade and metastatic capacity has
been reported in breast tumors and hepatocellular carcinomas
(30–32). Recently, increased interests of kisspeptins focused on
their key roles in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitarygonadal axis during puberty and reproductive development
(11, 33–38). Among different kisspeptins, Kp-10 is the shortest
peptide and highly conserved between mouse and human with one
conserved amino acid replacement (18). Previous studies reported
that Kp-10 regulated pubertal signaling in hypothalamus (38, 39),
inhibited cell migration of primary human trophoblasts in
placenta, suppressed metastatic activity of tumor cells (40), and
acted as a vasoconstrictor (41). However, it is still unclear whether
human Kp-10 inhibits angiogenesis or tumor angiogenesis. In this
study, we investigated the effects of human Kp-10 on tumor
angiogenesis and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found
that Kp-10 inhibited endothelial cell migration, invasion, and tube
formation. Using chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM) assay and mouse corneal micropocket models, we show
that Kp-10 inhibits angiogenesis in vivo. Furthermore, Kp-10
inhibited tumor growth by suppressing tumor angiogenesis in
xenograft mouse models with human prostate cancer cells. To
understand the molecular mechanism of Kp-10 in regulating
angiogenesis, we showed that Kp-10 inhibited Sp1-mediated VEGF
expression in tumor cells and suppressed the endothelial cell

migration by blocking the activation of c-Src/FAK and
Rac/Cdc42 GTPase. Therefore, our data suggest that Kp-10
inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth by blocking Sp1-mediated
VEGF expression and suppressing c-Src/FAK signaling pathway
activation.

Materials and Methods
Cells, cell culture, reagents, and animals. PC-3 and 293T cells were
obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection and maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) were kind gifts from
Dr. Xingli Wang (Cardiothoracic Surgery Division of the Michael E. DeBakey
Department of Surgery at Baylor College of Medicine Hospital) and cultured
in ECGM medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 1% BBE/
heparin mixture, 1% antibiotics, and 0.5% fungizone (1). VEGF was from
R&D Systems provided by Biological Resources Branch, National Cancer
Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center. Matrigel was
from BD Biosciences. Kp-10 peptide (purity >95%) was obtained from H.D.
Biosciences or Genenmed Synthesis.
Fertilized chicken eggs were purchased from Shanghai Poultry Breeding
Co. C57BL/6 mice were from the National Rodent Laboratory Animal
Resources, Shanghai Branch in China. Severe combined immunodeficient
mice (SCID/Ncr) were purchased from the National Cancer Institute.
Proliferation assay. Proliferation studies were carried out using the
CellTiter96 AQueous One solution cell proliferation assay as described
previously (1). Briefly, cells were plated at f5,000 HUVECs or PC-3 cells per
well in 96-well plate and allowed to adhere to the plate with different
concentrations of Kp-10. The cells were incubated for 48 to 72 h and the
AQueous One solution (Promega) was added to the samples and measured
at 490 nm.
Migration and tube formation assays. Two types of cell migration
assays were done using HUVECs. First, we examined cell migration in
scratch assays as described previously (42). Cells cultured in 6-well culture
dishes were scratched, washed with PBS, and cultured for 24 h. Cells
migrated toward the wound regions were imaged and counted. Modified
Boyden chamber migration assays were done as described previously (1),
4  104 HUVECs were cultured onto gelatin-coated 8 Am pore size
chambers (BD Bioscience), and the bottom well was filled with 10 ng/AL
VEGF as the chemoattractant. Twenty-four hours after incubating
chambers, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with H&E.
Migrated cells were imaged and counted using Olympus IX70 invert
microscope (Olympus) connected to digital camera DXM1200. For tube
formation assay, 4  104 cells were cultured onto Matrigel-precoated 24-well
culture dishes for 4 h at 37jC and determined as counting branching points
and tubes. Each experiment was done four times and independently done in
triplicate.
Chicken embryo CAM assay. According to previous method (43),
embryonic eggs were incubated in 38.5jC to 39jC with the relative humidity
at 65% to 70%. Five days later, a 1 to 2 cm2 window was opened. The shell
membrane was removed to expose the CAM. As the carrier, 6-mm-diameter
Whatman filter disk, which absorbed Kp-10 peptide, was put on the CAM.
Only PBS in the carrier was the control group. The window was sealed and
eggs were incubated again. Four days later, the CAM was observed under
stereomicroscope and the neovascularization was quantified. Assays for
each test sample were carried out three times (n = 15-20).
Mouse corneal micropocket assays. The mouse corneal assay was
done as described previously (44). Corneal micropockets were created with
a modified von Graefe cataract knife in one eye of each 5- to 6-week-old
C57BL/6 mice. Micropellets (0.35  0.35 mm) of sucrose octasulfatealuminum complex coated with hydron polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate
containing 160 ng VEGF165 or 1 Ag Kp-10 plus 160 ng VEGF-165 were
implanted into mouse corneal micropockets (n = 10-11). Seven days later,
photos and data were obtained. The area of neovascular response, vessel
length, and clock hours of new blood vessel were calculated according to
the formula: area (mm2) = 0.2  p  VL (mm)  CN (mm), where CN is the

clock hours of neovascularization, 1 clock hour equals 30j of arc and VL is
the maximal vessel length extending from the limbal vasculature toward the
pellet.
Xenograft tumor growth assay and immunohistochemistry. PC-3
human prostate tumor cells (3  106) were implanted s.c. on the back of
4-week-old male severe combined immunodeficient mice (n = 6). After
tumor volume reaching 50 mm3, Kp-10 (50 Ag/50 AL/mouse) was injected
intralesionally every day. Control groups were injected only with PBS.
The growth of the tumor xenograft was evaluated in a pilot study by
determining the tumor volume using digital caliper every 2 days. Tumor
growth was measured as a following equation: length  width2  0.52. Mice
were continually observed until were killed. Tumors were removed and
fixed and embedded with paraffin. Specific blood vessel staining was done
on the 5 Am sections with CD31 antibody (1). Images were taken with Zeiss
microscope. The number of blood vessels was counted.
Luciferase, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and reverse transcription-PCR. HUVEC was
transfected with pVEGF2018-luc, pVEGF133-luc, or pVEGF85-luc for 24 h and
then subjected to the luciferase activity. For the luciferase assay, luciferase
assay kit was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as described
previously (6). In brief, nuclear protein extracts (5 Ag) were incubated with
[g-32P]ATP-radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were carried out as described previously (45) with
5 Ag anti-Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit preimmune
serum. To detect VEGF mRNA expression, RNA was extracted from
cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) and cDNA was amplified using reverse
transcriptase. VEGF mRNA was amplified by general PCR. Primers are
as follows: forward 5¶-TGCCTTGCTGCTCTACCTCC-3¶ and reverse 5¶TCACCGCCTCGGCTTGTCAC-3¶. Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase used for loading control are as follows: forward 5¶GGTATCGTGGAAGGACTCAT-3¶ and reverse 5¶-ACCACCTGGTGCTCAGTGTA-3¶.
Western blot and immunoprecipitation. Fifty micrograms of protein
from cells lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer were loaded
onto 8% to 12% SDS gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane,
and incubated with the appropriate antibodies. Phosphorylated form of
c-Src was detected using anti-c-Src pY416 antibody (Cell Signaling).
To examine FAK phosphorylation, anti-FAK Y397 and anti-FAK Y576/577
(Cell Signaling) were used. Antibodies for Jun NH2-terminal kinase,
phospho–Jun NH2-terminal kinase, phospho–extracellular signal-regulated
kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phospho-p38, p38, VEGF, and
actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For the Rho
GTPase activity, substrates such as GST-PAK binding domain or GSTRhotekin binding domain induced in Escherichia coli were pulled down,
incubated with GST-Sepharose beads, and then mixed with 500 Ag whole
protein. To detect active Rho GTPases, the appropriate antibody such as
anti-RhoA, anti-Cdc42, or anti-Rac1 (all three from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) was used. Substrate-bound Rho GTPases present their
active state.
Statistics. Statistic results in vitro and in vivo were calculated using the
standard two-tailed Student’s t test on Microsoft Excel. Some statistical
analyses of data were done using the two-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni post hoc test using the GraphPad Quickcalc online Web site.4

Results
Kp-10 inhibits HUVEC migration, invasion, and tube
formation. To understand the function of Kp-10 in HUVECs, we
examined the expression of GPR54, the endogenous receptor for
Kp-10 in different cell lines. Our data indicate that GPR54 is
expressed in HUVEC and N3 cells but not in Chinese hamster

Figure 1. Kp-10 inhibits angiogenic properties of
endothelial cells. A, left, GPR54 was expressed in
HUVECs. Using Western blotting, the expression of
GPR54 was examined in N3, 293T, Chinese hamster
ovary, COS7, HUVEC, and NIH3T3 cells. GPR54 was
found in hypothalamic N3 cell line and HUVECs. Actin
was used for a loading control. Right, Kp-10 has little
effect on HUVEC proliferation. HUVECs (5,000) were
plated at 96-well plate. The cells were treated with
different concentrations of Kp-10 and measured using
the CellTiter96 AQueous One solution cell proliferation
assay kit (Promega). B, Kp-10 inhibits HUVEC
migration in wound-healing migration assays. HUVECs
were plated, scratched, and incubated in medium with
4 ng/mL VEGF in the presence or absence of various
concentrations of Kp-10 peptide. Kp-10 significantly
inhibited the VEGF-induced migration of HUVEC to the
wound area. Representative photomicrographs of cells

ovary, Cos7, NIH3T3, and HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A, left). As
endothelial cell proliferation is important and necessary for
angiogenesis, we investigated the inhibitory effect of Kp-10 on
the growth of endothelial cells. Survival curves obtained with the
MTS assay showed that high concentration of Kp-10 did not inhibit
the proliferation of HUVECs (Fig. 1A, right), suggesting that Kp-10
has little effect on HUVEC proliferation at normal physiologic
concentration. As cell migration and invasion are two key steps for
endothelial cells to form new blood vessels during angiogenesis
processes, we performed wound-healing assay and Boyden
chamber migration and invasion assays to determine the effects
of Kp-10 on HUVEC migration and invasion. Kp-10 inhibited the
migration of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B and C).
In vitro, endothelial cells can spontaneously form a threedimensional tubular capillary-like network on Matrigel culture.
To examine the effect of Kp-10 on HUVEC tubule formation, we
performed the tubule formation assays in the presence of different
concentrations of Kp-10 peptide in Matrigel. As shown in Fig. 1D,
Kp-10 dramatically inhibited HUVEC tube formation in a dose-

dependent manner, suggesting that Kp-10 regulated angiogenesis
in vitro.
The concentration of Kp-10 used in the angiogenesis study with
HUVEC is much higher than that used in standard intracellular
Ca2+ measurement. To make sure that Kp-10 used in our assay
conditions are active, we performed intracellular Ca2+ measurement in both Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing GPR54
and HUVECs (endogenous GPR54). Our data indicate that Kp-10
activates intracellular Ca2+ in Chinese hamster ovary-GPR54 cells
with a EC50 at 23 nmol/L, whereas the EC50 is f225 nmol/L in
HUVECs (Supplementary Fig. S1). These data indicate that Kp-10 is
active and the effect of Kp-10 in HUVEC requires much higher
concentration, which is similar to the effects we observed for Kp-10
in the inhibition of HUVEC angiogenic abilities.
Kp-10 suppresses angiogenesis in vivo. To determine the
effects of Kp-10 on angiogenesis in vivo, we examined whether
Kp-10 regulates angiogenesis using the CAM assays. As shown in
Fig. 2A, Kp-10 inhibited chicken embryonic blood vessel formation
at the concentration of 5 to 20 Ag/disk. Within avascular areas

(circled area of 15 mm diameter with f176 mm2 around a filter
paper disk), the number of newly formed blood vessels (black
arrows) was significantly decreased in Kp-10–treated disk (Fig. 2A,
left ). The effect of Kp-10 is dose-dependent without any
inflammation (Fig. 2A, right). These data suggest that Kp-10
suppresses angiogenesis in chicken embryonic blood vessel
formation assays.
To confirm the antiangiogenic activity of Kp-10 in CAM assays,
we further performed mouse corneal micropocket assay (Fig. 2B).
Micropellets (pointed with arrows) coated with the slow-release
polymer-hydron containing control buffer, VEGF, Kp-10, or VEGF
and Kp-10 were implanted into the avascular corneas of C57BL/6
mice, respectively. VEGF strongly induce new blood vessel
formation in mouse cornea (Fig. 2B, VEGF, left). Addition of
10 Ag Kp-10 significantly inhibited VEGF-induced neovascularization in the cornea (Fig. 2B, VEGF + Kp-10, right). Quantitation of
corneal neovascularization, presented as vessel length, clock hour
(the proportion of the circumference vascularized when the eye is
viewed as a clock), and vessel area showed that Kp-10 blocked
VEGF-induced corneal neovascularization by 60% to 80% (Fig. 2C).
As for the controls, we have used PBS, a scrambled peptide, and
the Kp-10 lacking the COOH-terminal amide in the experiments,

the scrambled peptide has no effect on angiogenesis, whereas the
Kp-10 without COOH-terminal amide has weak effect on
angiogenesis at similar concentration in the assay (data not
shown). In all treated mouse corneal experiments, no inflammation
was observed and no weight loss or unusual behavior was detected,
suggesting that Kp-10 has no or very little toxicity at the described
experimental doses. These results suggest that Kp-10 significantly
inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo.
Kp-10 inhibits tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth. To
understand whether Kp-10 directly affects tumor cell growth, we
performed PC-3 cancer cell proliferation assay. As shown in Fig. 3A,
Kp-10 has little effect on tumor cell proliferation in vitro even at
high concentration (100 Amol/L; P > 0.05), suggesting that Kp-10
had no direct effect on tumor cell proliferation. Given that tumor
growth is angiogenesis-dependent and suppression of angiogenesis
can inhibit tumor growth, we further examined the inhibitory
function of tumor growth by Kp-10 using mouse xenograft model.
As shown in Fig. 3B and C, after a 45-day treatment with Kp-10, the
mean tumor volume of Kp-10–treated group were much less than
that of PBS-treated control group (P < 0.01). In addition, there was
little difference in body weight between control and Kp-10–treated
mouse groups (Fig. 3C, right), suggesting little side effect of Kp-10

and 160 ng VEGF + 1 Ag Kp-10. Saline
alone and Kp-10 alone were used as
controls in the experiments. Corneal

photographed with a stereomicroscope on
day 7 after implantation. Arrows, positions

in the mouse model. To verify the inhibitory effect of Kp-10 on
tumor angiogenesis, we stained the 5 Am tumor sections with antiCD31 antibody. The average vessel number in Kp-10–treated group
was dramatically less than that in tumors of control group
(Fig. 3D), indicating that Kp-10 significantly inhibits tumor
angiogenesis and prevents tumor growth.
Kp-10 decreases Sp1-dependent VEGF expression. As the
expression level of VEGF is important for tumor angiogenesis (3–5),
we examined whether Kp-10 affects VEGF expression. As shown in
Fig. 4A, Kp-10 decreased expression of both VEGF mRNA and
protein in HUVEC. Thus, we further investigated whether Kp-10
regulated VEGF promoter activity in certain conditions such as
hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 4B, Kp-10 not only suppressed the basal
VEGF promoter activity but also decreased the activity of VEGF
promoter (pVEGF2018-luc) in both hypoxia cells (CoCl2-treated
cells) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a–overexpressing cells, respectively (Fig. 4B, left). Because the VEFG promoter contains both
hypoxia-inducible factor-1a–binding region and the GC-rich region

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

or Sp1 binding, we next examined whether the regulation of
VEGF promoter activity by Kp-10 is dependent on hypoxia
stimulation. Using the two luciferase-reporting vectors containing
the GC-rich regions where the hypoxia-inducible factor1a–binding site is deleted (pVEGF133-luc or pVEGF85-luc), we
show that Kp-10 significantly inhibited the activity of VEGF
promoter (Fig. 4B, right), suggesting that Kp-10 regulated
the expression of VEGF in a hypoxia-inducible factor-1a–
independent manner.
As VEGF promoter contains high GC boxes to which Sp1 binds
(8–11), we examined whether Kp-10 affected VEGF promoter
binding of Sp1 using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 4C, Kp-10
at 1 Amol/L inhibited DNA binding of Sp1 to the VEGF promoter in
electrophoretic mobility shift assay in both hypoxia and normal
conditions (with or without the treatment of CoCl2). To further
confirm the effect of Kp-10 on Sp1 binding of VEGF promoter, we
perform chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using different

(GAPDH) and actin were used for PCR and Western blot loading controls, respectively. B, Kp-10 mediates the inhibitory effect through the GC-rich boxes in

DNA-binding activity of Sp1 protein to VEGF promoter region in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Kp-10 inhibits both hypoxia-independent and hypoxia-dependent
Sp1 DNA-binding activity to VEGF promoter. When HUVEC was exposed to 1 Amol/L Kp-10 for 24 h, the binding of Sp1 to VEGF promoter region was diminished.
The effects of Kp-10 on Sp1 DNA binding of VEGF promoter in hypoxic condition were measured with the addition of 100 nmol/L CoCl2. D, Kp-10 inhibits DNA-binding
activity of Sp1 to VEGF promoter in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were done with different concentrations of Kp-10 after the cells were treated
for 24 h.

concentrations of Kp-10 in the treatment (Fig. 4D). Our data
showed that Kp-1 inhibited the binding activity of Sp1 protein to
VEGF promoter and suppressed Sp1-dependent VEGF expression
in endothelial cells.
Kp-10 down-regulates FAK- and Rac1/Cdc42-mediated
migration signaling pathways in the endothelial cells. We next
analyzed Kp-10–inhibitory signaling pathways against VEGFinduced HUVEC migration during the processes of tumor
angiogenesis. On VEGF stimulation, c-Src is phosphorylated and
then interacts with FAK, which follows the activation of molecules
downstream of c-Src/FAK complex. Thus, we examined whether
Kp-10 affects VEGF-induced activation of c-Src/FAK complex. As
shown in Fig. 5A, Kp-10 decreased VEGF-induced phosphorylation
of c-Src at Y416 and inhibited c-Src–mediated phosphorylation of
FAK at Y576/577, whereas Kp-10 has little effect on FAK
autophosphorylation at Y397 (Fig. 5A).
To understand how Kp-10 regulates the downstream signaling
molecules in HUVEC migration and invasion, we examine the
activation of Rho GTPases, key molecular regulators in cell
migration and invasion. As shown in Fig. 5B, Kp-10 inhibits the

www.aacrjournals.org

activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 by decreasing the amount of GTPbound active forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 as measured in our pulldown assays. On the other hand, Kp-10 increased the activation of
RhoA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B), suggesting that Kp-10
differentially regulated the activation of Rho family of GTPases. In
addition, Kp-10 inhibited the phosphorylation of Jun NH2-terminal
kinase but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38
(Fig. 5C). Together, our data show that c-Src–mediated FAK
phosphorylation and Rho GTPases are targets for Kp-10 inhibition
of HUVEC migration and invasion.

Discussion
Previous reports showed that Kp-10 plays a role as vasoconstrictor, causing the narrowing of blood vessels. It is, however,
unclear whether Kp-10 affects normal angiogenesis and tumor
angiogenesis. In this study, we provide evidence that Kp-10 inhibits
angiogenesis and tumor growth via blocking Sp1-dependent VEGF
expression and suppressing VEGF-dependent FAK and Rac1/Cdc42
activation.

Figure 5. Kp-10 inhibits the phosphorylation of c-Src/FAK and their downstream signaling proteins. A, Kp-10 decreased VEGF-activated phosphorylation of c-Src
and FAK. Cells were treated with VEGF alone or VEGF + Kp-10 for 5 min. VEGF-dependent phosphorylation of c-Src and FAK was detected with anti-Src pY416,
anti-FAK pY397, and anti-FAK pY576/577 antibody, respectively. B, Kp-10 down-regulates the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 (GTP-binding) but activates RhoA in the
GTPase pull-down assays. Cells were stimulated with the indicatives for 5 min. The activity assays of Rho GTPases were done using GST-PAK binding domain
and GST-Rhotekin binding domain as described previously in our laboratory (34). C, Kp-10 decreased VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Jun NH2-terminal kinase but
has little effect on the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 kinases. Phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases was examined
using different antibodies after HUVECs were stimulated with VEGF alone or VEGF + Kp-10 for 15 min.

Angiogenesis is a complex multistep process that involves cell
proliferation, migration, and tube formation. It has been shown
that suppression at any step of the processes in angiogenesis will
inhibit the formation of new blood vessels (46). In the present
article, we show that Kp-10 significantly inhibits HUVEC migration,
invasion, and tube formation but not proliferation (Fig. 1).
Furthermore, Kp-10 inhibited angiogenesis in vivo using CAM
and mouse corneal micropocket assays (Fig. 2), suggesting that
Kp-10 inhibited angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.

The Kp-10 concentration required to inhibit angiogenesis
properties is much higher than that used in our intracellular
Ca2+ signaling assays. Although we do not know the exact reasons
for the much higher concentration of Kp-10 required for the
inhibition of angiogenesis, the expression level of endogenous
expressed GPR54 in HUVECs is much lower than that in Chinese
hamster ovary cells overexpressing GPR54 in our Ca2+ measurement experiments and in the literature. In addition, HUVECs are
large vessel endothelium, which makes them suboptimal for

Figure 6. Diagram of Kp-10–mediated inhibition
of tumor angiogenesis by suppressing Src/FAK
and Rac1/Cdc42 signaling pathways and VEGF
expression. Kp-10 activates GPR54 and Gaq signaling
pathways and suppresses Sp1 binding of VEGF
promoter and VEGF expression. At the same time,
Kp-10–activated GPR54-G-protein signaling axis
regulates the phosphorylation and activation of Src and
FAK as well as Rho GTPases (Rac1 and Cdc42),
leading to the inhibition of cell migration and invasion.
Down-regulation of VEGF expression and suppression
of cell migration and invasion by addition of Kp-10
peptide lead to the inhibition of angiogenesis.
Therefore, Kp-10 inhibits angiogenesis by suppressing
Src-mediated FAK and Rac/Cdc42 signaling
pathways and the expression of VEGF.

angiogenesis studies. Therefore, higher concentration of Kp-10 is
required for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, whereas lower concentration of Kp-10 can induce intracellular Ca2+ signaling pathway
and has its normal physiologic functions in puberty.
Because tumor growth and metastasis depend on tumor
angiogenesis, inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is a novel therapeutic modality toward controlling tumor metastasis (47). Kp-10
significantly inhibited the angiogenic tumor growth (Fig. 3B and C)
but had little effect on tumor cell proliferation in vitro (Fig. 3A),
suggesting that Kp-10 inhibits tumor growth not directly through
inhibiting tumor cell proliferation per se but through inhibiting
tumor angiogenesis. In addition, Kp-10–treated mice did not show
any body weight loss compared with cisplatin-treated tumorbearing mice, suggesting that Kp-10 has little toxicity compared
with traditional antitumor drugs.
VEGF plays a key role in physiologic blood vessel formation and
pathologic angiogenesis. In our studies, we show that Kp-10
inhibits Sp1-mediated VEGF expression in endothelial cells
independently of the hypoxia condition (Fig. 4), suggesting that
Kp-10 could block the initiation step of tumor angiogenesis by
regulating the expression level of VEGF. Furthermore, Kp-10
inhibited endothelial cell migration and invasion via VEGFmediated signaling, suggesting that Kp-10 targets multiple steps
of tumor angiogenesis (Fig. 6).
In endothelial cells, VEGF activates c-Src and FAK and
subsequently the formation of c-Src/FAK signaling complex. Our
data showed that Kp-10 inhibited VEGF-induced phosphorylation

of FAK (Fig. 5A). However, Kp-10 did not affect VEGF receptor
phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus, Kp-10 via GPR54 appears
to target VEGF receptor–induced activation of FAK in endothelial
cells (Fig. 6). In addition, Kp-10 inhibits the activation of Rac1 and
Cdc42 GTPases and Jun NH2-terminal kinase in the cells (Fig. 5B
and C), indicating that Kp-10 inhibits key signaling molecules in
cell migration and invasion (refs. 48–50; Fig. 6).
In conclusion, our data show that Kp-10 inhibits angiogenesis
and suppresses tumor growth in vivo through inhibiting tumor
angiogenesis by selectively blocking Sp1-dependent VEGF expression and by suppressing VEGF-mediated FAK and Rac1/Cdc42
activation in endothelial cells (Fig. 6). Our new finding of Kp-10
function in angiogenesis suggests a new role of kisspeptins as an
antiangiogenesis agent.
