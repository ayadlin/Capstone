ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths due
to aggressive progression and metastatic spread. Aspartate β-hydroxylase (ASPH),
a cell surface protein that catalyzes the hydroxylation of epidermal growth factor
(EGF)-like repeats in Notch receptors and ligands, is highly overexpressed in PC.
ASPH upregulation confers a malignant phenotype characterized by enhanced cell
proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation in vitro as well as PC tumor
growth in vivo. The transforming properties of ASPH depend on enzymatic activity.
ASPH links PC growth factor signaling cascades to Notch activation. A small molecule
inhibitor of β-hydroxylase activity was developed and found to reduce PC growth by
downregulating the Notch signaling pathway. These findings demonstrate the critical
involvement of ASPH in PC growth and progression, provide new insight into the
molecular mechanisms leading to tumor development and growth and have important
therapeutic implications.

INTRODUCTION

4]. ASPH catalyzes the β-hydroxylation of aspartyl and
asparaginyl residues in epidermal growth factor (EGF)like repeats of various proteins such as Notch, Jagged
(JAG) and Delta-like (DLL) [5]. Notch signaling plays
critical roles in cell growth, differentiation, adhesion,
migration and metastasis [6].
This study examines the expression of ASPH in
human PC cell lines and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) tumor tissues, as well as determines how ASPH
activates Notch signaling as a major contributor to
generation of malignant phenotypes. We demonstrated
that ASPH exerts effector function by promoting
cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and malignant
transformation. More important, PC tumor growth and
progression may be altered by a small molecule inhibitor
(SMI) of ASPH β-hydroxylase activity.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the 4th leading cause of
cancer-related death in USA, with an estimated 45,220
new cases and 38,460 deaths in 2013 [1, 2]. Despite
improvements in detection and management, the 5-year
survival rate of PC is only 5-6%. At diagnosis, 80-85%
of patients present with advanced unresectable disease
due to invasion and widespread metastasis. Pancreatic
cancer is notoriously aggressive and refractory to
treatment [1, 2]. There is a need to explore the molecular
mechanisms of PC development, progression and
metastasis in an attempt to identify new molecular
targets for therapy. Aspartate β-hydroxylase (ASPH) is
an ∼86KD Type II transmembrane protein and a member
of the α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family [3,

intensity (Fig. 1c). Activated Notch1 and HES1 were also
overexpressed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of PDAC tumor
cells (Fig. 1d).
The expression profiling of ASPH in 7 human
PC cell lines was examined by Western blot analysis.
High levels of the 86kD ASPH proteins were found in
HPAFII, AsPC-1, Hs766T and Panc-1; very low levels
were observed in BxPC-3 and MIA PaCa2 and little, if
any, expression was noted in Capan-1 cells. Expression
profiling of Notch signaling proteins is presented for
comparison in Fig. 1e. We prepared lentiviral mediated
stable transfection of ASPH that localized to the cell
surface in MIA PaCa2 cells (Fig. 1f) with very low
endogenous levels of ASPH as described [7, 8]. Empty
vector transfected cells served as the control.
Figure 2 panel a-e demonstrate the biological effects
of ASPH overexpression on the PC cell phenotype on MIA
PaCa2 as measured by proliferation, migration, invasion,
as well as colony formation as an index of malignant
transformation. Similar findings were evident with
stable ASPH transfected Capan-1 cells (data not shown).
This aggressive malignant phenotype was significantly
attenuated by specific shRNAs “knockdown” of ASPH in
AsPC-1 cells with high endogenous levels as demonstrated
by a reduction in proliferation, migration, invasion and
colony formation (Fig. 3, panel a-e).

Notably, ASPH overexpression activated Notch
responsive genes such as HES1, HEY1, CD44, EpCAM,
c-Myc, MMP2/9, cyclin D3, and PCNA (Fig. 2f). To
further link ASPH expression to Notch activated genes,
we performed shRNA “knockdown” experiments in
AsPC-1 cells as demonstrated in Fig. 3f. Lentiviral
induced stable cell lines expressing scrambled shRNA
showed the expected high level of endogenous expression
of ASPH and prominent upregulation of HES1, HEY1,
CD44, EpCAM, c-Myc, MMP2/9, cyclin D3, and
PCNA. In contrast, AsPC-1 cells stably transfected with
3 different specific ASPH targeted shRNAs demonstrated
downregulation of these Notch responsive genes.
We determined if Notch1 and JAG2 directly interact
with and bind to ASPH by co-immunoprecipitation
experiments. As displayed in Fig. 4d, e, Notch1 and JAG2
directly interact with ASPH. Interestingly, this physical
interaction property was maintained with the mutant
H675Q ASPH construct, suggesting that the protein-protein
binding sites between ASPH and Notch1/JAG2 may be
independent from the enzymatic activity since a H675Q
mutation in the catalytic site has been previously shown
to reduce β-hydroxylase to 20% of “wild type” (WT)
levels [11]. ASPH expression also promoted nuclear
translocation of the C-terminal ICN of Notch1 into the
nucleus of MIA PaCa2 cells overexpressing WT-ASPH
(Fig. 4f). In contrast, nuclear accumulation of activated
Notch1 ICN was inhibited with loss of enzymatic activity
caused by H675Q mutation in ASPH as displayed in Fig. 4f.

β-hydroxylase activity is necessary for ASPH to
function as a transforming protein
The C-terminus of ASPH contains the amino acid
(aa) sequence of the catalytic site, (M670HPGTH675) and its
sequence is identical in human, rat, mouse and cattle [9].
The H675 aa is specifically involved in Fe2+ coordination
and is critical for its enzymatic activity; H675 aa is also
highly conserved in the chicken and fly [10].
We have established WT-ASPH and H675Q mutant
expression constructs (Fig. 4a, b, c). The human H675Q
mutant ASPH has an 80% reduction in enzymatic activity
and was subsequently examined to determine if there
would be a loss in ability to promote cell proliferation,
migration, invasion, and colony formation compared
to the “wild type” protein. Figure 5 illustrates the
stimulatory effects of WT-ASPH overexpression in PC
cells on proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony
formation, as well as the activation of Notch responsive
genes. However, the mutant ASPH H675Q inhibited cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation
as well as reduced HES1, HEY1, CD44, EpCAM, c-Myc,
MMP2/9, cyclin D3, and PCNA gene expression in PC
cells.

High throughput screening assay for ASPH
β-hydroxylase activity inhibitors.
An assay to measure ASPH β-hydroxylase activity
had been established as described [11, 12]. This high
throughput system was used to screen for potential small
molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of β-hydroxylase activity that
were synthesized as shown in Fig. 6a. When inhibitors of
ASPH β-hydroxylase activity were identified, a functional
MTT assay over a range of drug concentrations was
performed to assess their effects on cell viability and
growth. Examples of positive and negative results among
several candidate compounds are depicted in Fig. 6b.
These SMIs were rationally designed based upon the
aminohydroxyfuranone ring core. There was a “strong hit”
with one of the MO-I-1100 compounds since it reduced
β-hydroxylase activity by 80% and cell viability over a
range of concentrations (Fig. 6b).
The biological effects of reduced ASPH enzymatic
activity on generation of a malignant phenotype was
evaluated. Figure 7 demonstrates the inhibitory effects
of MO-I-1100 on ASPH induced proliferation, migration,

invasion and colony formation, as well as Notch signaling
activation in MIA PaCa2 cells with high expression of
WT-ASPH.
To further link the association between ASPH
overexpression and Notch activation, we treated MIA
PaCa2 cells with a γ-secretase inhibitor (DAPT) as
shown in Fig. 8. Treatment reduced PC proliferation,
migration and colony formation. Similar results were
obtained with HPAFII and AsPC-1 PC cells which have
high endogenous levels of ASPH indicating that enhanced
migration and invasion could be inhibited by MO-I-1100,
a SMI of ASPH β-hydroxylase activity in vitro under these
conditions as well (Fig. 8d-g).

Studies were performed to determine if ASPH
overexpression can promote tumor growth in Balb/c nude
mice inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) with MIA PaCa2
cells. Tumor growth rates are demonstrated in Fig. 9a,
where ASPH overexpression accelerated tumor formation
compared to tumors induced by stable vector transfected

transfected empty vector control MIA PaCa2 (Fig. 9b).
Since the only difference between these two cell lines was
the presence or absence of exogenous ASPH expression,
PC tumor development and growth may be most
susceptible to a SMI of β-hydroxylase activity in those
tumors that have high levels of ASPH expression.
Furthermore, established large tumors generated by
MIA PaCa2 cells stably overexpressing ASPH and vector
control were available for analysis of Notch signaling
after MO-I-1100 treatment as shown in Fig. 9c, d. Tumor
growth that was inhibited by MO-I-1100 treatment was
analyzed for Notch1 ICN expression, which demonstrated
a reduction in cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation
following treatment as shown in Fig. 9c. In addition, there
was a downregulation of Notch responsive genes in these
tumors as demonstrated by reduced JAG2, HES1 and
PCNA expression as illustrated in Fig. 9d. The antitumor
effects of blocking ASPH β-hydroxylase activity was
also assessed in immunodeficient mice with two other PC
cell lines that have high endogenous ASPH expression
(HPAFII and AsPC-1). The results suggest that reducing
the β-hydroxylase activity with MO-I-1100 treatment has
substantial effects on PC tumor growth as shown in Fig.
9e, f.

regulation of ASPH is mediated by phosphorylation of
GSK3β-related motifs located in the N-terminal region
of the molecule [24]. The present study attempts to
address several questions central to the function of ASPH
in PC. Is ASPH a major activator of Notch signaling in
PC to promote cell proliferation, migration, invasion
and malignant transformation? Is the enzymatic activity
central to its biological function as a transforming protein?
Can the β-hydroxylase activity be inhibited by SMIs to
produce antitumor effects in preclinical animal models
which could be extended to patients in the future? Is the
biological activity of ASPH dependent on Notch signaling
as a central mechanism for generating its oncogenic
properties?.
Activation of Notch signaling may be one of the
major factors involved in PC development and growth.
There is ample evidence to suggest that the upregulation
of Notch receptors and ligands [25] is a common feature
of such tumors [26] which leads to enhanced expression
of downstream Notch target genes [13, 27, 28]. Notch
signaling, which is induced by overexpression of
its receptors and ligands, may be required for tumor
maintenance [29]. However, characterization of other
activators of the Notch cascade in PC and how they may
be connected is not well established [13].
ASPH is significantly upregulated in PC patients
as shown in Fig. 1. These observations suggest that
ASPH may play an important role in PC pathogenesis.
We observe that ASPH expression was negative by IHC
in grade 1 and 2 PanINs. There is very weak staining
for ASPH expression with grade 3 PanINs with more
advanced cytological atypia characterized by mitotic
figures, pleomorphism and hyperchromatic nuclear
staining and prominent nucleoli. Thus, ASPH appears
to be overexpressed primarily in the fully transformed
malignant phenotype with little, if any, expression
in premalignant lesions. These findings suggest that
the protein may play an important role in the PC
transformation process. Of interest is that metastatic
spread of PC to regional lymph nodes was highly positive
for ASPH expression (7 lymph nodes were examined
derived from 4 different tumors). As shown in Fig.1d,
ASPH staining is correlated with enhanced activated
Notch 1 and HES1 expression. It has been reported that
ASPH high expression is associated with poor survival of
HCC and cholangiocarcinoma patients [21, 30]. We are
currently obtaining similar information on PC patients to
determine the relationship between ASPH expression in
tumor tissue and clinical outcome. ASPH protein may be
also involved in other biological processes, besides the
Notch pathway, to promote PC development and there is
evidence that expression inhibits apoptosis, stimulates cell
proliferation and prevents development of senesecence by
other non-Notch related cascades (unpublished).
The purpose of measuring the expression profiling
of ASPH and Notch (full-length [FL] and intracellular

DISCUSSION
The Notch signaling cascade is a highly
conserved pathway that principally controls cell fate
determination during embryogenesis by facilitating
cell-cell communications. It is a major regulator of
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and plays
a prominent role in apoptosis [13]. The transcriptional
program mediated by this signaling cascade includes
upregulation of the well characterized HES and HEY
family of transcription factors. Some of the other wellknown and characterized downstream target genes include
P21, c-Myc, PDGFR, EGFR, WNT 3/4, PTEN, Bcl-2,
cyclin D 1/3, cyclin E1, MMP2/9, CD44, EpCAM and
PCNA [14-18]. Several investigations suggest that the
expression and activation of Notch receptors and ligands
appear to be downregulated in the normal adult pancreas
[13], only to re-emerge during pancreatic oncogenesis.
ASPH has negligible to very low expression in
normal adult human tissue with the notable exception of
the placenta, an invasive tissue, where its expression is
robust [19, 20]. ASPH is expressed in many organs during
embryogenesis, presumably to promote cell migration
for organ development. Its expression is “shut off” in the
adult only to re-emerge during oncogenesis where it may
be required for generation of malignant phenotypes [11,
12, 21]. Transcriptional regulation of ASPH is provided
by tripartite signaling pathways: insulin (IN) and insulin
like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/insulin-receptor substrate
type 1 (IRS1)/MAPK/ERK, IN/IGF1/IRS1/PI3K/
AKT, and WNT/β-Catenin [22, 23]. Post-transcriptional

domain [ICN]) pathway components is to identify these
PC cell lines with low vs. high endogenous ASPH
expression and to subsequently make the stable cell lines
with exogenous overexpression of ASPH vs. knockdown
of ASPH in the presence of Notch receptors and ligands
(for example, JAGs) for further investigations on the
molecular mechanisms of PC carcinogenesis. Lentiviral
induced ASPH overexpression in MIA PaCa2 PC cells
with low endogenous expression levels was notable for
translocation of the protein to the tumor cell surface. This
ultimately conferred a malignant phenotype, characterized
by enhanced proliferation, migration, invasion and
colony formation. The β-hydroxylase activity of ASPH
appeared central to its function, as the expression of the
H675Q mutant construct, which had an 80% reduction of
enzymatic activity reversed this cellular phenotype (Fig.
5).
The development and characterization of SMIs
of β-hydroxylase activity was informative. Based
on this high-throughput screening approach and the
crystal structure of the ASPH catalytic site, a number of
potential candidate SMIs were synthesized. We found
that a MO-I-1100 compound was a potent inhibitor of
ASPH and reduced enzymatic activity by about 80%
compared to the “wild type” protein. In this regard, MOI-1100 substantially inhibited PC cell migration and

invasion in HPAFII and AsPC-1 cell lines, which have
high endogenous levels of ASPH. In addition, similar
effects were observed in MIA PaCa2 cells with stable
overexpression of exogenous ASPH. More importantly,
MO-I-1100 treatment of nude mice bearing s.c. grown
tumors induced by these three PC cell lines reduced tumor
growth and progression. It was of interest that MO-I-1100
was effective on PC tumors that expressed ASPH, but
appeared inactive in parenteral PC cells with low ASPH
levels. These findings raise the possibility that a high level
of ASPH expression in human PC tumors may be a useful
biomarker for selection of tumors that could respond to
SMIs of β-hydroxylase as a potential therapeutic approach.
Little is known regarding the factors and signaling
pathways that activate the Notch cascade in PC. The
observation that IN/IGF1/IRS1/RAS/RAF/MAPK/ERK,
IN/IGF1/IRS1/PI3K/AKT and WNT/β-catenin pathways
upregulate ASPH at the transcriptional level and crosstalk
with each other [31-33] links these growth factor signaling
cascades that are commonly upregulated in PC [34-45]
to Notch activation through ASPH. Overexpression of
ASPH activates Notch by promoting cleavage of Notch1
ICN to liberate the C-terminal ICN and subsequently
upregulates, at the transcriptional level, a number of
downstream Notch responsive genes such as HES1,
HEY1, CD44, EpCAM, c-Myc, MMP2/9, cyclin D3, and

Fig. 10: Hypothesis of how ASPH may be involved in the pathogenesis of PC progression through Notch activation [6]. The structure
of ASPH molecule consists of cytoplasmic (green), transmembrane (purple), luminal region (blue) and catalytic domain (red), which
contains the catalytic site (M670HPGTH675). (a) In the presence of β-hydroxylase activity of ASPH, binding of the JAG ligand (green) on
one cell to the Notch receptor (purple) on another cell results in two proteolytic cleavages of the receptor. The ADAM10 or TACE (TNFα-converting enzyme; ADAM17) metalloprotease (black) catalyzes the S2 cleavage and generates a substrate for S3 cleavage by the
γ-secretase complex (red). This proteolytic processing mediates release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which enters the nucleus
and interacts with the DNA-binding CSL (CBF1, Su(H) and LAG-1) protein. The co-activator Mastermind (Mam) and other transcription
factors are recruited to the CSL complex, whereas co-repressors (Co-R) are released. Thus, the Notch signaling is on and the downstream
target genes are expressed: CD44 and EpCAM are markers for cancer stem cells; PCNA, cyclin D3, c-Myc, MMP2/9, HES1 and HEY1
are involved in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, tumor growth and metastasis in PC. (b) SMIs block the catalytic site of ASPH, which
leads to loss of β-hydroxylase activity and failure of JAG2 binding to Notch1. Thus, Notch signaling is off and its oncogenic effector is
inhibited in PC.

PCNA. Moreover, a mutation (H675Q) in the catalytic site,
as well as a SMI of ASPH β-hydroxylase activity, reverses
ASPH mediated Notch activation. In addition, treatment of
ASPH overexpressing PC cells with a γ-secretase inhibitor
(DAPT) reduced a phenotype of enhanced migration,
invasion and colony formation which suggests that ASPH
effector activity may be mediated through Notch signaling.
Figure 10 depicts a working hypothesis of how
ASPH contributes to PC development and progression.
In this scheme, overexpression of ASPH is followed by
translocation to the cell surface where it directly interacts
with Notch (Fig. 4). Notch receptors contain 36 EGF-like
repeats in the extracellular domain (NECD), which are the
substrates of ASPH β-hydroxylase. ASPH may facilitate
the interactions of the Notch receptors with their ligands
(such as JAG and DLL). It is hypothesized that enhanced
Notch receptor-ligand interaction leads to the generation
of activated Notch1 ICN followed by upregulation of
downstream responsive target genes. The net biological
effect is to promote cell proliferation, migration,
invasion, tumor growth and metastasis, which leads to PC
development and progression; this cellular phenotype is
attenuated by a SMI of ASPH β-hydroxylase activity.

Cell lysates were separated by SDS PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot
analysis was performed by using primary antibodies
against ASPH; JAG1, JAG2, DLL1, DLL4, Notch1,
Notch2, Notch3, Notch4, c-Myc, matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP)-2, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM),
and CD44 (Cell Signaling Technology #2620, #2205,
#2588, #2589, #4380, #4530, #5276, #2423, #5605,
#13132, #2929, #5640, respectively); activated Notch1,
HES1 and HEY1 (Abcam ab8925, ab71559, ab22614,
respectively); cyclin D3, MMP9, and proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Santa Cruz, sc-56307, sc-21733,
sc-7907, respectively). Protein bands were visualized
by IRDye® 680RD Infrared Dye and IRDye® 800CW
Infrared Dye and exposed on Odyssey image system (LICOR).

MTT
Cell proliferation was analyzed using the MTT
assay. Sable PC cells (MIA PaCa2 and AsPC-1)
transfected with vector, ASPH or ASPH-shRNA (1.5 × 104
cells per well) were seeded in 24 well plates and cultured
for 4 days. Fresh media were changed every 2 days. Cells
were incubated with MTT solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in
corresponding media (10% v/v) at 37°C for 3 h. Then
0.1 N HCI isopropanol was added. Plates were analyzed
daily at a wavelength of 570 and 690 nm, respectively. The
background absorbance of multiwall plates measured at
690 nm was subtracted from the measurement at 570 nm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
The human PC cell lines AsPC-1, BxPC-3, Capan-1,
HPAF-II, Hs766T, MIA PaCa2 and Panc-1, as well as
hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (positive
control) were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. All cell lines have been authenticated by
short tandem repeat profiling to reduce the frequency
of cell misidentification. Cells were cultured at 37°C
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in
corresponding media supplemented with 10% FBS and
antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin). Cells were
passaged when they reached 80% confluence.

Wound healing assay
Stable PC cells (MIA PaCa2 and AsPC-1)
transfected with ASPH or vector were seeded in a 6-well
plate and cultured to reach 80% confluence. Cells were
starved for 24 h in corresponding media containing 1%
FCS before a scratch was made using a 200 µl pipette
tip. The wounded monolayer was washed with PBS,
incubated with 5% FCS, and photographed using a
microscope. Cells were incubated for an additional 24 h
and then photographs were taken of the wounded area.
All data were obtained from at least three independent
experiments.

We established two stable MIA PaCa2 cell lines
with overexpression of ASPH, and three stable AsPC-1
cell lines with knockdown of ASPH by specific shRNAs
using the lentiviral system (GeneCopoeia, #EX-Z8758Lv105 and # HSH011500-HIVU6, respectively) as
described [7, 8]. Three shRNAs sequences used to
target ASPH were as follows: [HSH011500-1-HIVU6

Generation of a small molecule inhibitor (SMI) of
ASPH enzymatic activity

Drug treatment of animal models
The xenograft model employed s.c. injected PC
cell lines with high levels of exogenous or endogenous
ASPH expression. They were injected s.c. into the right
shoulder at a concentration of 5×105 varying to 5×106
cells depending in part on the cell lines employed.
These cell concentrations would produce tumors in
approximately 100% of control male nude mice. The left
shoulder was implanted with vector-transfected PC cell
lines for comparison with the right shoulder implanted
with a high ASPH expressing cell line such as AsPC1. Tumor growth rate was monitored every 3 days. The
animals were sacrificed when tumors reached 2.5 cm (per
request of the Animal Studies Committee). Tumors were
dissected, weighed, frozen and stored to measure Notch
signaling expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and Western blot analysis. PC cell lines were allowed
to form established tumors before initiation of treatment
with SMIs so that measurements of the above parameters
could be made before and after therapy with MO-I-1100
(a comparison between initially untreated tumors and
treated residual PC). Eight to 10 animals were employed
in each group (treatment and control). The dose range
of MO-I-1100 was 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg administered
intraperitoneally (i.p.).

Synthesis and characterization of novel SMI for ASPH
Based on the crystal structure of the ASPH catalytic
site, computer generated drug design was performed,
leading to the synthesis of a series of parent compounds
and derivatives likely to fit into the pocket of the catalytic
site and inhibit the β-hydroxylase activity. Figure 6
listed some of the parent compounds synthesized and
examined for inhibition of β-hydroxylase activity using
a high throughput screening assay. Synthesis of SMIs
was accomplished in two steps. The first step was a threecomponent reaction including an aromatic aldehyde,
glyoxal bisulfate addition product, and potassium
cyanide to yield an arylhydroxytetronimide. In the second
step arylhydroxytetronimide was sulfonylated with
phenylmethansulfonyl chloride in dry tetrahydrofuran
to yield. Compounds were characterized by 1H and
13
C nuclear magnetic resonance, high resolution mass
spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography,
infra-red spectroscopy, melting point, elemental analysis
and binding to ASPH by isothermal titration calorimetry.

Subcutaneous tumor model

Immunohistochemistry

This research was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Rhode Island
Hospital. Athymic BALB/c male nude mice (Charles River
laboratory) were housed in laminar flow cabinets under
specific pathogen-free conditions and studied at 5-6 weeks
of age. Stable MIA PaCa2 cells, in exponential phase of
growth were transfected with vector or ASPH lentiviral
expression. In addition, AsPC-1 and HPAFII cells were
harvested, washed, and resuspended in Ca2+/Mg2-free
HBSS, and adjusted to the desired cell concentration.
Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion
and single-cell suspensions containing >90% viable cells
was employed. In the subcutaneous (s.c.) model, tumor
cells (5×105 to 5×106 in 0.2 mL of HBSS) were injected
s.c. into the left (vector) and right (ASPH) shoulder
of the nude mice, respectively. Growth of tumors was
monitored by measuring the tumor size with calipers
every 3 days. The tumor volume (mm3) was calculated
using the formula: length × depth × depth × 0.5236. The
mice were sacrificed after 2 weeks. The tumors were
harvested, weighed and fixed with 10% neutral buffered
formalin. Immunohistochemical staining for nuclear
accumulation of Notch1 intracellular domain (ICN) and
Western blot analysis of Notch signaling molecules were
also performed.

Tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing pathologic
specimens from 104 individuals with state I/II PDAC
were used for IHC. Those patients had undergone
pancreaticoduodenectomy at Lifespan Rhode Island
and the Miriam Hospitals, Warren Alpert School of
Medicine, Brown University. The study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of Lifespan Rhode
Island and the Miriam Hospitals. Immunohistochemical
staining was conducted on 4-um formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) unstained sections using the FB-50
mAb. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene and
rehydrated in a descending ethanol gradient. Antigen
retrieval was performed using Citric Acid Based Antigen
Unmasking Solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA) in a microwave pressure cooker (Nordic Ware,
Minneapolis, IN) for 6 min at full power, followed by
a 30 min cool down process. Endogenous peroxidase
activity was quenched by a 30 min treatment with 3%
hydrogen peroxide in methanol. The remaining steps of
the staining procedure, including blocking, secondary
antibody incubation, and ABC reagent addition, were
performed using the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Kit
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Primary antibodies were diluted
in TBS/0.1% Tween-20 with 5% normal goat serum and
were incubated at 4°C overnight. Color development

was performed using DAB Tablets (Wako Chemicals,
Richmond, VA) as a substrate per manufacturer’s
instruction. Finally, the sections were counterstained by
hematoxylin, dehydrated in an ascending ethanol gradient,
and mounted with VECTSHIELD Mounting Medium
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).

All results were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical
analyses were performed with the two-tailed Student’s
t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test between control and
treatment groups using SPSS software. Due to the normal
distribution of the results, comparisons between PC
tumor and adjacent non-neoplastic tissue were evaluated
by paired t-tests. A p value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

ASPH

IHC stained slides of PC tissue microarrays were
observed at 400× magnification and the staining results
were scored. Tumor cells were evaluated for ASPH
expression with comparison to surrounding normal
pancreas, acute/chronic pancreatitis, normal intestine, and
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

H675Q mutant ASPH construct and Drs. Tong and de la

ASPH mutant and shRNA constructs
We inhibited ASPH function by generating a
mutant H675Q construct, which reduces β-hydroxylase
activity to 20% of “wild type” (WT) level, or by shRNAs
“knockdown”. The structures of WT-ASPH and H675Q
mutant expression constructs that were inserted into the
pCDNA3 vectors are shown in Fig. 4. Inclusion of a c-Myc
tag allowed for discrimination between exogenous and
endogenous protein levels. Empty vector, WT-ASPH and
H675Q-ASPH overexpressing stable MIA PaCa2 PC cell
lines were established by using the lentiviral expression
system (GeneCopoeia). The ASPH H675Q mutant, which
substantially reduced the β-hydroxylase activity, was
compared to the WT-ASPH with respect to effects on cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation of
stable MIA PaCa2 cells. These constructs were also tested
for inhibition of Notch signaling as a downstream effector
of ASPH biological activity. The ASPH protein level
was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescent
staining. The ASPH overexpressing MIA PaCa2 stable PC
cell line is shown in Fig. 1f. Notch signaling components
were assessed by measuring expression profiling of ASPHNotch network genes through Western blot analysis.
Expression levels of activated Notch1 and HES1 were
evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining in tissue
samples derived from PC patients as shown in Fig. 1d.
