phase plate. The SAC can be activated by lack of kinetochoremicrotubule attachment or loss of tension on the kinetochore
microtubules, thus allowing it to respond to the major types of
aneuploidy-generating defects that arise during mitotic progression
(reviewed in refs. 1–3). The SAC blocks anaphase entry by
inhibiting the APC/Cdc20 complex, a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase
that induces anaphase by promoting proteosomal degradation of
mitotic substrates. The mechanism of APC/Cdc20 inhibition by the
SAC is multitiered, including inhibitory binding of SAC components Mad2 and/or BubR1 to Cdc20 and Bub1-mediated inhibitory
phosphorylation of APC/Cdc20 (3). Distinct inhibitory pathways
may be activated by different conditions (e.g., loss of microtubule
attachment versus loss of tension), although it remains unclear
whether the different regulatory mechanisms function in separate
pathways or as part of an integrated signaling system. The relative
contributions of each mechanism to overall mitotic fidelity are also
not well understood.
The spindle checkpoint machinery is encoded by a core group of
genes originally identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including
Mad1–3, Bub1, Bub3, and Mps1 . Yeasts lacking core SAC
components grow normally under unperturbed conditions yet
display increased rates of chromosome missegregation and are
unable to grow in the presence of spindle poisons, such as
nocodazole (4–6). Studies of SAC function in mammals have been
limited by the fact that murine null mutations in core SAC
components, including Bub3, Mad1, Mad2, and BubR1, cause very
early embryonic lethality, precluding analysis of embryonic
fibroblasts or later developmental stages in null mutants (7–10).
However, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) heterozygous for
Mad2, Bub3, and BubR1 displayed haploinsufficiency, resulting in
higher levels of mitotic abnormalities (9, 11, 12). Furthermore,
whereas heterozygous animals were viable in each case, they
displayed increased age-related spontaneous (11) or carcinogeninduced (9, 13) tumorigenesis. Mice with a hypomorphic BubR1
allele that reduced BubR1 levels to f11% of wild type (wt) were
viable but displayed cellular senescence, growth retardation, and
progeroid features without a significant increase in tumor
formation (12). These studies indicate that the SAC is essential
for early embryonic development in mammals but that the
phenotypes obtained from incomplete SAC impairment may vary
across a broad range, depending on the depleted component and
the degree of depletion. SAC components may also have SACindependent functions that contribute to the observed phenotypes
in some cases (14–16).
Despite its identification as a core spindle checkpoint
component in yeasts, the functions of Bub1 have not been fully
elucidated. Bub1 is a serine/threonine kinase that localizes to
kinetochores during mitosis and mediates efficient kinetochore
localization of other SAC components. Bub1 deletion in yeasts
causes high chromosome missegregation rates under normal

Abstract
Bub1 is a serine/threonine kinase originally described as a
core component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)
mechanism in yeast. Bub1 binding at kinetochores has been
reported to be required for SAC function and localization of
other SAC components. A proper SAC is believed to be
essential for murine embryonic development, as all previously
described null mutations in SAC components in mice cause
embryonic lethality. We produced mice harboring a Bub1
mutant allele lacking exons 2 and 3, resulting in a hypomorphic mutant expressed at <5% of wild-type levels. Despite this
significant reduction, homozygous mutant animals are viable
on a mixed 129P2/B6 or FVB background but display
increased tumorigenesis with aging, whereas mice with a
C57Bl/6J background die perinatally. Bub1 mutant murine
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) display defects in chromosome
congression to the metaphase plate, severe chromosome
missegregation, and aneuploidy accompanied by high levels
of premature senescence. Mutant MEFs have a robust SAC in
response to nocodazole treatment but an impaired response
to Taxol. Mutant MEFs also show reduced kinetochore
localization of BubR1, but not of Mad2. The significant
reduction in SAC response to Taxol, but not nocodazole,
coupled with the reduced binding of BubR1, but not Mad2,
indicates that Bub1 is particularly critical for the SAC
response to a lack of tension on kinetochores. Thus, Bub1 is
essential for proper chromosome segregation, a defect that
can lead to severe phenotypes, including perinatal lethality
and a predisposition to cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(1):45–54]

Introduction
Proper chromosome segregation is critical at every cell division
to prevent aneuploidy, a condition associated with aggressive
cancer, birth defects, and infertility (reviewed in ref. 1). The spindle
assembly checkpoint (SAC) is a major guardian of mitotic fidelity.
The SAC works as a checkpoint and timing mechanism to delay
sister chromatid separation and anaphase onset until all chromosomes achieve bipolar attachment to microtubules at the meta-

The Cre transgene was removed by segregation before intercrossing
Bub D2-3/+ animals. MEF studies were performed with MEFs derived from
embryos on the C57Bl/6J background (B6N4+). All mice were maintained
according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Bub1GT8 allele. Bub1 gene-trapped ES cell clone XG453 was obtained
from Bay Genomics. The gene trap is produced by a splice-acceptor-h-geo
cassette within Bub1 intron 7. XG453 ES cells were injected into C57Bl/6J
blastocysts, and resulting chimeras were bred to C57Bl/6J females and
screened for germline transmission by PCR. Animals used in experiments
reported here were backcrossed one to two generations to C57Bl/6J. All
animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Cell culture. MEF lines were generated from e13.5-e14.5 using standard
protocols. MEFs were cultured at 5% CO2 in media containing DMEM-H
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L glutamine, 50 Ag/mL penicillin,
50 Ag/mL streptomycin, and 55 Amol/L 2-mercaptoethanol and were
passaged every 2 d by plating 500,000 viable cells. All experiments with
MEFs were performed at passages 3 to 4, unless otherwise stated. Growth
curves were generated by counting total number of viable cells at each
passage. Drug treatments were used at the following concentrations:
nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 ng/mL; paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 Amol/
L; MG132 (Calbiochem), 10 Amol/L.
Spindle checkpoint analysis. Asynchronously growing MEFs were
treated with 200 ng/mL nocodazole for indicated times, trypsinized, fixed
for 20 min in 1% formaldehyde, spun down, and resuspended in 70% cold
ethanol. For flow cytometry, cells were stained with anti–phosphorylated
histone H3 (Upstate Biotechnology) at 1:500 and Alexafluor 488 (Invitrogen)
at 1:1,000, followed by propidium iodide. Cells (30,000) were analyzed on a
Becton Dickinson FACScan, and the number of phosphorylated histone H3–
postive cells was measured as a percentage of total cells.
Immunofluorescence. Coverslips were fixed in 2% formaldehyde,
permeablized in PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBS-TX), and washed in PBS.
After blocking for 30 min in PBS-TX plus 5% nonfat dried milk (NFDM) or
bovine serum albumin (BSA), coverslips were incubated overnight with
primary antibodies. Antibodies were used at the following concentrations:
rabbit anti–phosphorylated histone H3, 1:500 (Upstate Biotechnology); anti–
h-tubulin, 1:250 (Tub2.1, Sigma-Aldrich); sheep anti-Bub1, 1:500 (Steve
Taylor); rabbit anti-Mad2, 1:500 (E.D. Salmon); rabbit anti-BubR1, 1:500 (BD
Biosciences); human anti-centromere, 1:500 (ACA, Antibodies Incorporated.). After washes with PBS-TX, coverslips were incubated for 1 h with
appropriate secondary antibodies (Alexafluor 488 or 594) at 1:500 in PBS-TX
plus 5% NFDM or BSA, washed with PBS-TX, stained with 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI), and mounted with Flouromount G (Electron
Microscopy Sciences). Analysis was carried out on a Leica DMRXA
microscope. See supplementary data for specifics on kinetochore localization methods.
Karyotyping. MEFs at passage 5 were treated with Karyomax colcemid
(Invitrogen) for 4 h, trypsinized, resuspended in warm 75 mmol/L
hypotonic KCl buffer, and incubated for 20 min. Cells were washed at least
four times in Carnoy’s buffer before being resuspended in fresh Carnoy’s fix,
dropped into cold, ethanol-washed slides, and stained with DAPI. Images of
single-cell spreads were acquired on a Leica DMRXA microscope with a 63
objective. Chromosomes from distinct individual cells were counted, with
chromosome numbers of >70 for a single cell being discarded as
endoreduplication.
Senescence assay. MEFs grown on coverslips at indicated passages were
fixed in 1% formaldeyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min before being
treated overnight (14–18 h) in senescence-associated h-galactosidase assay
buffer (see ref. 27). Cells were counterstained with DAPI, and cells, staining
positive for senescence, were counted as a percentage of total cells.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Subconfluent MEFs
were treated with 200 ng/mL nocodazole for 6 h, lysed in modified
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 30
to 60 min in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) with 5% NFDM, incubated
overnight at 4jC with anti-Bub1 at 1:1,000 (a kind gift from Steve Taylor),

growth conditions, in addition to lethality under perturbed
conditions (4–6). Studies in vertebrate systems have been
confined to biochemical and cell culture models and have
produced some conflicting results about Bub1 roles in mitotic
regulation. Bub1 is essential for spindle checkpoint activity in
Xenopus extracts, and the bulk of this activity requires the NH2
terminus, with minor requirements for the COOH terminal kinase
functions (17, 18). In cultured mammalian cell lines, Bub1
reduction via RNA interference (RNAi) produced conflicting
results. In one case, Bub1 was surprisingly dispensable for the
SAC function but was required for chromosome congression (15).
An independent study found that Bub1 was required for a
functional SAC response to nocodazole while confirming the role
in chromosome congression (16). These differences are difficult to
reconcile but may stem from distinct levels of Bub1 depletion
and/or differences in cell lines used for the studies. More recent
studies have revealed a role for Bub1 in meiotic and mitotic sister
chromatid cohesion via interaction with shugoshin (19, 20).
Finally, compromised Bub1 function has been indirectly associated with tumorigenesis, indicating an important need to
understand the molecular links associated with Bub1 function,
mitotic regulation, and tumor suppression (21–24).
To better understand Bub1 functions and the consequences of
Bub1 loss in vivo, we developed a conditional Bub1 mutation in
mice. We report here that this mutation is hypomorphic, causing a
severe reduction in Bub1 levels. Mice homozygous for the Bub1
hypomorph mutation are viable on mixed 129P2/B6 and FVB
genetic backgrounds but display high rates of tumorigenesis. The
mutant phenotype is more severe on a C57Bl/6J background, where
homozygous mutants die perinatally. In MEFs, Bub1 mutation
causes high rates of chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy,
accompanied by growth defects and premature senescence.
Surprisingly, the spindle checkpoint is functional in Bub1 mutant
MEFs, although the checkpoint response to Taxol is significantly
impaired. BubR1 kinetochore localization is markedly reduced in
Bub1 mutant MEFs, consistent with the conclusion that Bub1 plays
a key role in a BubR1-dependent tension-sensitive SAC response.
These findings indicate that Bub1 is critical for proper progression
through mitosis and that defects in Bub1 signaling cause severe
defects ranging from early lethality to tumorigenesis.

Materials and Methods
Bub1 gene targeting and mice. Bub1 genomic BAC clones were
isolated from a 129SvEv library by hybridization screening and subsequent
PCR verification. The bacterial strain EL350 (25) was used for ‘‘recombineering’’ to subclone a 13-kb fragment encompassing Bub1 exons 1 to 6 into
a pUC19-based plasmid, including a phosphoglycerate kinase–thymidine
kinase gene (a gift of R. Thresher, University of North Carolina Animal
Models Core Facility). A loxP site was inserted in intron 1 by recombineering a loxP-flanked zeocin cassette, followed by Cre-mediated cassette
removal in EL350. A loxP and FRT-flanked neomycin resistance cassette was
subsequently inserted into intron 3. The targeting vector was linearized and
used for gene targeting in E14 ES cells (129P2/OlaHsd strain). ES cell
targeting was verified by PCR and Southern blot, and correctly targeted
clones were injected into C57Bl/6J blastocysts for chimera generation.
Chimeric males were bred to C57Bl/6J females, and germline transmission
of the Bub1neo allele was verified by PCR. The BubD2-3 and Bub1f alleles were
generated by crossing the Bub1neo allele with an X-linked CMV-Cre strain
(26). Bub D2-3 viability phenotypes were studied on three genetic backgrounds: 129/B6 (F2-F4), B6N4+, and FVBN7+. For the FVB studies, the
Bub1D2-3 allele was independently derived from the Bub1neo allele by
crossing (FVBN5)Bub1neo/+ animals to an FVB-h-actin-Cre deleter strain.

crosses on a mixed 129P2/B6 genetic background (Table 1).
However, intercrosses performed after backcrossing four or more
generations to C57Bl/6J yielded live Bub1D2-3/D2-3 animals at only
20% of expected Mendelian frequency (Table 1), and nearly all
live-born (B6)Bub1D2-3/D2-3 mice died perinatally. (B6)Bub1D2-3/D23
mice seemed to breathe and nurse normally but displayed
runting and failure to thrive in the early postnatal period. The
average weight of Bub1D2-3/D2-3 animals was 1.19 F 0.06 g versus
1.41 F 0.13 g for wt (P < 0.01) on day of birth. To date, only two
homozygous animals survived to weaning at 21 days. To
determine when the remaining 80% of (B6)Bub1D2-3/D2-3 mice
die, embryos were generated from (B6)Bub1D2-3/+ intercrosses at
E13.5-14.5 and E17.5-18.5. At both E13.5-14.5 and E17.5-18.5,
(B6)Bub1D2-3/D2-3 , (B6)Bub1D2-3/+ , and (B6)Bub1+/+ embryos were
recovered at Mendelian ratios (Table 1). Histologic analysis of
sections from e14.5 and e18.5 whole embryos did not reveal any
morphologic defects (data not shown). Observations of cell death
in the liver and the marked paleness of some (B6)Bub1D2-3/D2-3
embryos led us to perform cell blood count analysis on blood
from e18.5 embryos, revealing mild anemia and leukocytosis. In
summary, (B6)Bub1D2-3/D2-3 mice displayed perinatal lethality of
unknown cause, whereas Bub1D2-3/D2-3 animals were viable on a
129/B6 mixed background. We also derived the Bub1D2-3 allele
on an FVB genetic background, in which (FVB)Bub1D2-3/D2-3
animals are obtained at Mendelian ratios (Table 1). Together,
these results indicate that that the phenotype of the Bub1D2-3
allele is modified by the genetic background. The perinatal lethal
phenotype of (B6)Bub1D2-3/D2-3 animals is similar to that of mice
harboring a hypomorphic mutation of the BubR1 spindle
checkpoint gene (12), as well as mice with mutations of DNA
damage genes, such as BRCA2 (29). This observation, coupled

Results
Generation of the Bub1D2-3 allele. We generated a conditional
mutation of the murine Bub1 gene by homologous recombination
in ES cells. Based on available sequence information, deletion of
exons 2 and 3 was predicted to cause a null allele by creating a
frameshift early in exon 4, leading to a premature stop codon in
exon 6 (Fig. 1A). The targeting construct was designed with a loxP
site in intron 1 and a loxP-flanked neomycin resistance cassette in
intron 3, thus allowing deletion of exons 2 and 3 by Cre-mediated
recombination (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Correctly targeted ES cell
clones were used to generate chimeric founders that transmitted
the Bub1neo allele through the germline (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Bub1neo/+ mice were crossed to a germline Cre deleter strain (see
Materials and Methods) to produce the Bub1 floxed allele (Bub1f )
by removal of the neomycin resistance cassette and the Bub1D2-3
allele by removal of the neo cassette and exons 2 and 3. Bub1neo/+,
Bub1f/+, and Bub1D2-3/+ mice are viable and fertile. Genotypes were
confirmed by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 survival is dependent on genetic background. Homozygous deletion of spindle checkpoint genes
Mad2, Bub3, and BubR1 in mice causes embryonic lethality at
e4.5-7.5 during rapid expansion of the inner cell mass (7, 8, 10).
Bub1D2-3/+ mice were intercrossed to test whether Bub1 loss also
causes early embryonic lethality. Surprisingly, Bub1D2-3/D2-3
animals were obtained at near Mendelian ratios from inter-

could produce a protein that is out of frame until reaching the
exon 1 to exon 4 splice but in-frame thereafter (aa77–aa1058)
and/or (b) translation from in-frame internal ATGs present in
exon 4 or beyond producing NH2 terminal truncations (aa103 or
aa173–aa1058; Fig. 1A). These ATGs are not in Kozak consensus
sequences but could still give rise to protein (30). To distinguish
these possibilities, we analyzed protein from Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs
by Western blot using an antibody raised against Bub1 aa336aa489 (31). No Bub1 protein was detected in extracts from
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs, whereas Bub1D2-3/+ and Bub1+/+ MEFs
expressed a Bub1 protein of expected size (Fig. 1B). Likewise,
no protein was detected in 129/Bl6 Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs or tissues
(data not shown). Titration of wt cell lysate showed the
sensitivity of Bub1 detection to be 5% of normal endogenous
levels (Fig. 1C), indicating that the Bub1D2-3 allele disrupts
production of the wt Bub1 protein and that any protein
produced from the mutant allele must be produced at <5% of
wt levels. Immunoprecipitation–Western blot analysis using an
antibody recognizing residues 1-331 of the Bub1 protein for
immunoprecipitation (28) and the antibody recognizing residues
336-489 for Western blot analysis (31) detected a mutant-specific
band of f115 kDa in Bub1D2-3/D2-3 and Bub1D2-3/+ samples
(Fig. 1D). This protein could be produced by translation from
either an upstream or downstream ATG and, thus, lacks at least
the NH2 terminal 73 aa of Bub1. Thus, the phenotypes observed
in Bub1D2-3/D2-3 mice and MEFs could be due to the lack of a
critical NH2 terminal Bub1 domain, severely diminished protein
levels, or both.
Bub1 and BubR1 kinetochore localization are reduced in
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs. Bub1 localizes to kinetochores in response
to lack of spindle attachment and/or tension and is required for
efficient localization of other spindle checkpoint proteins that
mediate the spindle checkpoint activity (15). The domain required
for Bub1 kinetochore localization is encoded by exon 8 and is, thus,
likely to be included in the protein encoded by the Bub1D2-3 allele
(32). Nevertheless, Bub1 staining at kinetochores of Bub1D2-3/D2-3
MEFs was only 2% of wt (Fig. 2A), consistent with severely reduced
total levels of mutant Bub1 protein.
In cultured cell lines, Bub1 is required for efficient kinetochore
localization of other spindle checkpoint proteins, such as Mad2
and BubR1 in response to SAC activation (15, 33). SAC activation
can be modeled experimentally by treating cells with nocodazole
(which causes a loss of kinetochore-spindle attachment and
tension) or Taxol (which disrupts tension forces between
kinetochores while leaving attachments intact). Using immunofluorescence, we examined the Mad2 and BubR1 at kinetochores of
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs after nocodazole or Taxol treatment. However,
significant cell-to-cell variation and high background with ACA
staining precluded accurate measurement (Supplementary Fig. S3).
To control for the variance, cells singly stained with Mad2 or BubR1
were counted and classified according to level of kinetochore
localization (Fig. 2B): ++++, bright kinetochore staining; +++, dim
above background kinetochore staining; ++, kinetochore staining at
punctate background levels; +, no kinetochore staining. Using this
stratification, a clear difference in kinetochore localization of
BubR1, but not Mad2, was detected in response to both nocodazole
and Taxol. Mad2 staining was clearly evident at kinetochores (++++
or +++) in 100% of Bub1+/+ and 93% of Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs after
nocodazole treatment. Mad2 localization after Taxol treatment is
comparably weak in both wt and mutant cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast,
BubR1 kinetochore localization was greatly reduced in

with results from inactivation of other spindle checkpoint genes
in mice, strongly suggests that the Bub1D2-3 allele retains partial
function.
The Bub1D2-3 allele is hypomorphic. The recovery of viable
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 mice suggested the Bub1D2-3 allele may be hypomorphic rather than null. To test this hypothesis, we obtained mice
harboring a Bub1 gene-trap allele with a h-geo cassette and splice
acceptor inserted in intron 7 (see Materials and Methods).
Intercrosses of Bub1gt8/+ animals revealed a likely maternal defect
in breeding, as very few live mice of any genotype were recovered
from these crosses and 90% of embryos were resorbed by e14.5.
Crosses of Bub1D2-3/+ females with Bub1gt8/+ males showed that
compound heterozygous (Bub1D2-3/gt8 ) animals were absent before
e11.5 (Table 1). Because the genetic background in these experiments is mixed 129/B6 (a background that supported survival of
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 animals), the failure to recover compound heterozygous animals at midgestation is strong genetic evidence that the
BubD2-3 allele is hypomorphic, as the Bub1gt8 allele is apparently
more severe.
To determine the nature of the Bub1D2-3 mutation, we first
analyzed mRNA production in MEFs from E14.5 embryos. Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR; not shown) and Northern
hybridization analysis showed equivalent RNA levels in Bub1+/+
and Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Bub1D2-3/D2-3
MEFs expressed a single Bub1 mRNA that was smaller than the
wt mRNA, consistent with the deletion of exons 2 and 3. cDNA
from Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs was cloned and sequenced, demonstrating
that the mRNA produced from the mutant allele is spliced from exon
1 to exon 4, as predicted (Supplementary Fig. S2B). No novel
alternatively spliced RNAs were detected by Northern or RT-PCR
analyses using various primer sets across the Bub1 mRNA sequence
(data not shown). Together, these data suggest that the residual
function of the Bub1D2-3 allele, if any, must be derived from the
D2-3 mutant mRNA.
Analysis of the predicted mRNA from the Bub1D2-3 allele
suggested two alternative possibilities for mutant protein
expression: (a) an ATG codon 5¶ to the published start codon

Impaired Bub1 Function In vivo Leads to Aneuploidy, Tumorigenesis

Bub1D2-3/D2-3 cells when treated with nocodazole (44% of cells had
clear kinetochore localization versus 99% of wt; P < 0.05) or Taxol
(15% versus 83%, respectively, P < 0.05; Fig. 2D). These results
indicate that Bub1 is necessary for proper BubR1 kinetochore
localization in response to lack of kinetochore-microtubule
attachment and, particularly, to the lack of microtubule tension.
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs exhibit a defective spindle checkpoint,
chromosome segregation errors, and increased aneuploidy.
Kinetochore localization of SAC proteins Mad2 and BubR1 has
previously been speculated to be necessary for SAC function. The
reduced BubR1 kinetochore localization in Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs
suggested that these cells may have a defective SAC response. We
tested spindle checkpoint responses of Bub1D2-3/D2-3, Bub1D2-3/+ , and

wt MEFs by measuring mitotic indices (percentage of positive
phosphorylated histone H3) after treatment with nocodazole or
Taxol. Bub1+/+, Bub1D2-3/+, and Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs all showed an
increased mitotic index by 12 hours after nocodazole addition
compared with untreated cultures, indicating that each genotype
retains at least partial SAC function in response to spindle ablation
(Fig. 3A). Nocodazole-treated Bub1D2-3/+ and Bub1D2-3/D2-3 cultures
contained only modestly lower indices (5.8% and 7%, respectively)
than the Bub1+/+ cultures (8.9%). This result contrasts with reported
results from MEFs heterozygous for a null mutation in Bub3 or a
hypomorphic mutation of BubR1, which show a severely impaired
arrest in response to nocodazole treatment (9, 12). Likewise, there
was no increase in premature sister chromatid separation after

Bub1+/+ ), another microtubule depolymerizing agent. In contrast to
nocodazole treatment, Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs did display a severe SAC
defect in response to Taxol treatment (mitotic index, 3.5% for
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 versus 8% for Bub1+/+ ; Fig. 3A). These data suggest that
reduced protein levels and/or NH2 terminal deletion of Bub1 is
more detrimental to the response to the loss of tension than the loss
of attachment.
The primary role of the spindle checkpoint is to aid proper
segregation of the chromosomes by delaying anaphase until all
chromosomes are attached and under tension by spindle fibers.
Loss of the spindle checkpoint has been linked to increased
aneuploidy in several models of spindle checkpoint loss (9, 12).
To test whether relaxation, but not complete abrogation

of the spindle checkpoint, can increase aneuploidy under
normal growth conditions, we determined the chromosome counts
in metaphase spreads from Bub1 mutant and wt MEFs. Seventy-six
percent of metaphases from Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs were aneuploid,
compared with 9% of wt and 23% of Bub1D2-3/+ metaphases
(Fig. 3B). Most of the aneuploid cells showed gain or loss of only one
to two chromosomes. These high levels of aneuploidy represent an
extreme level of chromosome instability, indicating that Bub1 is
essential for proper chromosome segregation under unperturbed
growth conditions.
Whereas the aneuploidy in Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs could be due to a
relaxed spindle checkpoint, Bub1 has also been implicated in
proper chromosome congression (i.e., the movement of chromosomes to the metaphase plate; refs. 15, 16). To test whether Bub1

phenotypes occur in this system. Wt and heterozygous cultures
grew at similar rates, with expected decreases in cell accumulation
at higher passages due to senescence (35), whereas Bub1D2-3/D2-3
MEFs grew much more slowly (Fig. 4A). To ascertain the cause of
the growth differences, we assessed levels of apoptosis and
senescence. Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs did not show increased apoptosis
relative to wt and heterozygous cells, as measured by Annexin V
staining (data not shown). However, senescence-associated hgalactosidase assays revealed that Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs had a
significant increase in senescence compared with wt MEFs at
passage 3 (9.1% versus 3.1) and passage 5 (15.4% versus 4.4%)
examined (Fig. 4B and C). The percentage of BrdUrd incorporating
cells was also lower in Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs, consistent with the
increase in senescent cells (not shown). Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs did not
show marked increases in the DNA damage marker phosphorylated H2AX (3.1% versus 2.6% in wt MEFs; Fig. 4D), indicating that
DNA breaks did not contribute significantly to the senescent
phenotype. These results indicate that the high levels of
chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy in Bub1D2-3/D2-3 cells
trigger growth impairment via premature senescence.
Impaired Bub1 function predisposes to increased tumorigenesis. Aneuploidy arising from spindle checkpoint impairment
or other defects has long been hypothesized to contribute to
tumor formation. In support of this hypothesis, most heterozygous mouse spindle checkpoint mutants generated to date have
shown modest increases in spontaneous and/or carcinogeninduced tumor formation (11–13, 36). However, some evidence
suggests that extreme aneuploidy may inhibit tumorigenesis
(12, 37). To determine if Bub1 impairment contributes to tumor
formation, cohorts of (129/B6)Bub1D2-3/D2-3 and controls were of
ages of 2 years. Approximately, 76% of (129/B6)Bub1D2-3/D2-3 mice
developed tumors by 23 to 25 months compared with 42% of
(129/B6)Bub1D2-3/+ (P < 0.05) and f28% of (129/B6)Bub1+/+
animals (P < 0.05; Fig. 5A) As in aging wt mice, the majority
of (129/B6)Bub1D2-3/D2-3 tumors were of liver origin and occurred
at an increased frequency. Importantly, Bub1 mutation also

mutant MEFs congress chromosomes properly, synchronized MEFs
were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 as cells were
entering mitosis. Inhibiting the proteasome blocks securin and
cyclin B degradation, preventing the separation of sister chromatids at the metaphase plate and stopping mitosis in metaphase.
Defects in chromosome congression are detected by an increase in
chromosomes that have not aligned at the metaphase plate.
Consistent with previous RNAi studies (15, 16), MG132-treated
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs showed an increase in chromosome congression defects, with 19.6% of mutant versus 5.7% of wt MEFs
displaying uncongressed chromsomes (Fig. 3C). This result
supports the conclusion that Bub1 plays a role in chromosome
congression and suggests that defective congression may contribute to extreme aneuploidy of Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs.
Uncongressed chromosomes should trigger a SAC response,
delaying anaphase onset until congression is complete and
kinetochores are under tension. We reasoned that the reduced
sensitivity of the SAC response in Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs may allow
cells to enter anaphase despite the presence of one or more
unattached or mono-oriented kinetochores, resulting in daughter
cells with gain or loss of one to two chromosomes. This model
predicts that unperturbed cells should have high rates of
anaphase lagging chromosomes. Indeed, analysis of unperturbed
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs during anaphase revealed that 47% of
Bub1 D2-3/D2-3 MEFs in anaphase had one or more lagging
chromosomes compared with only 9% of wt and 8% of heterozygotes
(Fig. 3D). Taken together, these results suggest that the extreme
aneuploidy of Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs is caused by a combination of
defects in chromosome congression and SAC activation.
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs are growth impaired with high rates of
senescence. High levels of aneuploidy in BubR1 hypomorphic
animals and MEFs correlated with growth impairment and high
levels of senescence (12). Furthermore, a recent study indicated
that RNAi knockdown of Bub1 in primary human fibroblasts
resulted in increased senescence (34). We determined growth and
senescence rates in Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs to assess whether similar

the early embryonic lethality previously described for homozygous
null mutants of the SAC genes Mad2, BubR1, and Bub3 (7, 8, 10).
Based on the proposed Bub1 ATG translation start site, the Bub1D23
mutation was designed to produce a severely truncated protein
lacking the kinase domain and expected to be nonfunctional.
Analyses of the mRNA expressed in mutant MEFs indicate that the
transcript lacking exons 2 and 3 is expressed at normal levels.
Immunoprecipitation–Western blot analysis of nocodazolearrested MEFs identified a unique protein in Bub1D2-3/+ and
Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs, which is f5 kDa smaller than wt Bub1 and
present at <5% of wt levels. Thus, the mutant Bub1 protein seems
to be produced by translation from an alternative ATG, the most
likely of which would give rise to an NH2 terminal truncation
starting at exon 4, which retains the COOH terminal kinase domain
and the kinetochore binding domain. The NH2 terminal domain of
Bub1 is highly conserved in nearly all species, but its function is
still largely unknown. In fission yeast, checkpoint activity and
kinetochore localization were mapped to residues 28-160, whereas
mammalian Bub1 residues 200-300 were found to be required for
SAC function and kinetochore localization (6, 32). Because the
mutant protein is expressed at such low levels, the current studies
cannot distinguish whether impaired function results from deletion
of a critical NH2 terminal function, insufficient protein, or both.
Future studies will help to distinguish these possibilities, as well
as determine the reason for the background-dependent phenotypic
differences found in C57Bl6/J and FVB or mixed background
mice. Nonetheless, this mutant provides a tool for probing the
effects of reduced Bub1 functions in cells and during embryonic
and adult development.
Bub1 in mitotic checkpoint regulation. MEFs derived from
mutant and wt littermate embryos were used to assess the cellular
phenotypes associated with impaired Bub1 function. A recent RNAi
study in cell lines questioned a role for mammalian Bub1 in SAC
function (15), whereas a distinct study found that Bub1 depletion
ablated the SAC (16). We show here that, despite undetectable
levels of Bub1 binding at kinetochores, Mad2 is able to localize at
kinetochores in Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs, which arrest in mitosis when
treated with nocodazole. These surprising results indicate that very
little Bub1 is required for SAC activity in response to microtubule
ablation in MEFs. Perera and colleagues (39) recently found that
Bub1-null MEFs do not show a sustained arrest after treatment
with nocodazole, whereas Jeganathan and colleagues (38) showed
that MEFs with f20% of wt Bub1 activity arrest for a shorter
duration than wt MEFs in nocodazole. The distinct methodologies
used (duration of mitotic arrest versus mitotic index) make it
difficult to directly compare these results to ours and could be
responsible for the discrepancy. However, this inconsistency raises
the possibility of a scenario where we have underrepresented the
amount of Bub1D2-3 protein expressed and are primarily observing
the effects of the NH2 terminal deletion of the allele. Nevertheless,
our results are supported by previous findings with Bub1 small
interfering RNA that only 5% of endogenous levels could support a
mitotic arrest with spindle ablation (15, 16). These results together
are consistent with a model in which a small amount of Bub1 is
sufficient to arrest cells in response to spindle ablation. This
contrasts with the haploinsufficiency of the SAC function in MEFs
heterozygous for Bub3 or hypomorphic for BubR1, which show very
little mitotic arrest after nocodazole treatment (9, 12).
In contrast to Mad2, BubR1 kinetochore localization is reduced
in Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs in response to nocodazole and is further
reduced after Taxol treatment. A similar reduction in BubR1

broadened the tumor spectrum. Lung tumors appeared in 16%
(4 of 25) of (129/B6)Bub1D2-3/D2-3 mice, whereas no lung tumors
were found in wt littermate controls (Fig. 5B). Whereas a
significant increase in spontaneous tumors was not observed in
the (129/B6)Bub1D2-3/+ cohort, a lung tumor and a brain tumor
were observed, suggesting a possible change in tumor spectrum.
These data indicate that Bub1 is a low penetrance tumor
suppressor, likely with significant quantitative effects based on
the genetic modification of phenotypes in distinct genetic
backgrounds. Together with the results from Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs,
these data indicate that chromosome missegregation defects
leading to aneuploidy in cells of Bub1 mutant mice drive
postnatal developmental defects ranging from lethality to tumor
formation, depending on the associated genetic context.

Discussion
We have probed the functions of the mammalian mitotic
regulator Bub1 by generating a hypomorphic mutation (Bub1D2-3 )
in mice that lacks part of an NH2 terminal conserved domain
implicated in spindle checkpoint function in yeast. In addition, the
protein is expressed at severely diminished levels, yet retains
sufficient function to support development to birth or adulthood,
depending on genetic context. In the C57Bl6/J background,
homozygous mutant mice die perinatally with a ‘‘failure-to-thrive’’
phenotype, whereas FVB and mixed 129P2/C57Bl6/J backgrounds
support survival to late adulthood. However, these mice develop a
high incidence of cancers compared with wt littermates solidifying
a role for impaired Bub1 function in tumorigenesis.
Bub1D2-3 was characterized as a hypomorphic mutant by
demonstrating that compound heterozygotes with a gene-trapped
allele, Bub1gt8 , die by E11.5. Indeed, two contemporary reports
show that Bub1 null mutants arrest by E7.5 (38, 39), consistent with

(43). Thus, it is possible that the increased metabolic demand of
extra chromosomes taxes cellular machinery, causing a stress
response that triggers senescence. Aneuploidy may also trigger
stress responses by causing imbalances in signaling pathways.
Bub1 and tumor suppression. Aneuploidy has long been
associated with cancers, raising the hypothesis that spindle
checkpoint impairment may predispose to tumorigenesis (44–46).
Indeed, the presence of Bub1 mutations in human colon cancer cell
lines (21) and murine lymphomas (22) fueled this hypothesis. Here,
we show a causal relationship between impaired Bub1 function and
predisposition to cancer. When analyzed in a background
permissive to survival, impaired Bub1 function predisposed to a
higher frequency and expanded spectrum of tumors relative to wt
littermates. Tumors arose in aging mice, indicative of a low
penetrance effect, consistent with the notion that noncatastrophic
rates of aneuploidy can produce tumorigenic chromosomal
imbalances. Mice heterozygous for a null mutation of other SAC
genes also resulted in increased tumor incidence, either spontaneously [Mad1 (36), Mad2 (11), Cenp-E (37)] or after carcinogen
treatment [BubR1 (13) and Bub3 (9)]. The recent work of
Jeganathan and colleagues (38) showed an increasing tumor
incidence with progressive loss of Bub1, reaching 55% in mice
with f20% of endogenous Bub1 levels. The higher tumor incidence
(76%) in our model correlates with the further reduction in Bub1
levels to <5% and the corresponding increase in mitotic
abnormalities. A severe hypomorphic allele of BubR1 caused only
a modest increase in tumorigenesis; however, animals aged
prematurely, potentially confounding the quantitative assessment
of tumor incidence (12). CENPE haploinsufficiency, which also
causes severe aneuploidy, was recently shown to have either
protective or tumorigenic effects, depending on the genetic and
environmental context (37). Thus, the influence of mitotic infidelity
on tumor formation seems to be dependent on the cellular and
genetic context and likely reflects a quantitative trait. The level of
mitotic disruption may be critical for tumor formation, with high
levels of chromosome missegregation incompatible with cell
survival or activating tumor suppression pathways, such as
senescence. Future study of the hypomorphic Bub1D2-3 mutation
in the context of an allelic series with other available Bub1
mutations, in addition to alterations in senescence pathway
factors, such as p53, should provide valuable insight into to the
mechanistic relationship between mitotic aberration, chromosome
instability, and cancer.

kinetochore localization was recently observed in Bub1-null and
hypomorph MEFs, providing a strong consensus that Bub1 is
critical for BubR1 localization (38, 39). Previous kinetochore
localization studies suggest that BubR1 is responsive to changes
in tension, whereas Mad2 binds kinetochores in response to
attachment failure (40). The inhibition of APC/Cdc20 in response
to nocodazole may be due to integration of signals from both
pathways (as evidenced by strong localization of both BubR1 and
Mad2 with nocodazole treatment), whereas Taxol may only trigger
the BubR1-dependent pathway. While we see a reduction in BubR1
kinetochore localization after nocodazole treatment, the presence
of substantial Mad2 at kinetochores in addition to reduced
amounts of BubR1 is apparently sufficient for responding to loss
of kinetochore-microtubule attachment. Although Bub1 was
previously shown to be necessary for efficient localization of both
Mad2 and BubR1 to kinetochores, our data suggest that Bub1 is
more critical in the tension-sensitive BubR1 signaling pathway
than in attachment sensing.
We show here that Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs rapidly develop a high
frequency of aneuploidy that is likely explained by a weakened
SAC response. Nocodazole-treated and Taxol-treated Bub1D2-3/D2-3
MEFs have a reduced mitotic index relative to wt cells; yet, these
assays are relatively crude and may not accurately measure
weakened signaling capacity. A more sensitive test of SAC
function comes when most chromosomes achieve bipolar
attachment and tension, as the remaining signal from even a
single unattached kinetochore must be sufficient to block
anaphase onset until attachment and tension are achieved (41,
42). Under these conditions, insufficiency of SAC components
may impair the SAC enough to allow anaphase onset, resulting
in lagging chromosome(s). The high frequency of Bub1D2-3/D2-3
cells with lagging chromosomes, coupled with the fact that only
one or two such chromosomes are observed in most cells,
suggests that chromosome missegregation in Bub1 D2-3/ D2-3 cells
is triggered by a defect in sensing minor, rather than
catastrophic, mitotic aberrations. Bub1 has also been reported
to play a role in chromosome congression and regulation of
sister chromatid cohesion (15, 16, 19, 20). We observed an
increase in chromosome congression errors in Bub1D2-3/D2-3
MEFs, suggesting that this mechanism may contribute to the
mitotic errors in these cells. However, the percentage of cells
with obvious congression errors was low relative to the
percentage with lagging chromosomes, suggesting that congression errors are unlikely to account for the full extent of
missegregation observed. Moreover, noncongressed chromosomes
should invoke a SAC arrest under normal conditions. Therefore,
we argue that the mitotic defects in Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs are a
consequence of impairment in both chromosome congression
and SAC signaling.
A large body of evidence indicates that cellular senescence
suppresses cellular proliferation in response to DNA damage and/or
oncogene activation. Here, we show that Bub1D2-3/D2-3 MEFs are
significantly growth impaired and produce high levels of premature
senescence. This effect was less severe in Bub1D2-3/+ MEFs, which
also displayed lower levels of aneuploidy. Thus, a major consequence
of impaired Bub1 function and resulting chromosome segregation
errors seems to be permanent cell cycle arrest. Increased senescence
was also observed in BubR1 hypomorph mice (12), which also
display high rates of aneuploidy. Furthermore, aneuploid yeasts were
recently shown to display impaired growth and metabolic changes
accompanied by evidence of protein degradation and folding distress
