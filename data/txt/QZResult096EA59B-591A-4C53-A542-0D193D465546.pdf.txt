promising anticancer agent due to its ability to induce apoptosis in
a variety of tumor cell types while having negligible effects on
normal cells (1, 2). TRAIL induces apoptosis in tumor cells via the
death receptor pathway, using a mechanism similar to that of TNF
(3). TRAIL has also been shown to cross-link with the death
receptors DR4 or DR5, leading to the aggregation of these
receptors, recruitment of the Fas-associated death domain adaptor
molecule, and activation of the initiator caspase-8 (4). The
activated caspase-8 is then released into the cytoplasm and
initiates a protease cascade that activates downstream ‘‘effector’’
caspases, such as caspase-3 (5).
Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors
and are known to invade the surrounding normal brain tissue.
This often results in incomplete surgical resection, local
recurrence, and a poor response to multimodal therapeutic
interventions, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy (6). Many
malignant glioma cells are resistant to TRAIL despite their
expression of TRAIL receptors (7, 8). Therefore, the development
of a new therapeutic strategy, which restores the TRAIL-induced
apoptotic potency in glioma cells, is of utmost importance. One
agent that may be of use in sensitizing glioma cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis is arsenic trioxide (As2O3), which has a long
history of use as a pharmaceutical agent (9). Recently, As2O3 was
shown to induce tumor cell apoptosis or differentiation and thus
has considerable efficacy in the treatment of patients with acute
promyelocytic leukemia (9, 10). Furthermore, As2O3 shows
anticancer effects not only in hematologic cancers other than
acute promyelocytic leukemia (11–13) but also in solid tumors
derived from several tissues (14–17). Despite these observations,
the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of As2O3 are not
fully understood.
In this study, we show that the combined treatment of TRAILresistant glioma cells with subtoxic doses of As2O3 and TRAIL
dramatically induces glioma cell apoptosis, but is not cytotoxic to
normal human astrocytes. This suggests that the combined As2O3
and TRAIL treatment may offer an attractive and safe strategy for
the treatment of malignant gliomas. The current study also
presents the underlying mechanisms by which this combined
treatment achieves selective killing of glioma cells. We show that
As2O3 induces CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation and that
TRAIL stimulates partial priming of the proteolytic processing of
caspase-3. Therefore, the combined treatment with As2O3 and
TRAIL may synergistically stimulate and accelerate the death
receptor–mediated apoptotic signaling pathway. These effects are
only induced in glioma cells and not in astrocytes, suggesting that
they may be responsible for the effective induction of cancer cell
apoptosis.

Abstract
The current study shows that treatment of tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)–resistant
glioma cells with a combination of TRAIL and subtoxic doses
of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) induces rapid apoptosis. Whereas
TRAIL-mediated proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 was
partially blocked in glioma cells, treatment with As2O3
efficiently recovered TRAIL-induced activation of caspases.
We also found that As2O3 treatment of glioma cells significantly
up-regulated DR5, a death receptor of TRAIL. Furthermore,
suppression of DR5 expression by small interfering RNA
(siRNA) inhibited As2O3/TRAIL-induced apoptosis of U87MG
glioma cells, suggesting that DR5 up-regulation is critical for
As2O3-induced sensitization of glioma cells to TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis. Our results also indicate that an increase in
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP)
protein levels precedes As2O3-induced DR5 up-regulation.
The involvement of CHOP in this process was confirmed by
siRNA-mediated CHOP suppression, which not only attenuated
As2O3-induced DR5 up-regulation but also inhibited the As2O3stimulated TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These results therefore
suggest that the CHOP-mediated DR5 up-regulation, brought
about by As2O3, stimulates the TRAIL-mediated signaling
pathway. This in turn leads to complete proteolytic processing
of caspase-3, which is partially primed by TRAIL in glioma
cells. In contrast to human glioma cells, astrocytes were very
resistant to the combined administration of As2O3 and TRAIL,
demonstrating the safety of this treatment. In addition, As2O3mediated up-regulation of CHOP and DR5, as well as partial
proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 by TRAIL, was not
induced in astrocytes. Taken together, the present results
suggest that the combined treatment of glioma cells with As2O3
plus TRAIL may provide an effective and selective therapeutic
strategy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(1):266–75]

Sensitization of TRAIL-Mediated Apoptosis by Arsenic Trioxide
Measurement of reactive oxygen species. Cells were plated at a density
of 5  104 in 24-well plates, allowed to attach overnight, and exposed to
5 Amol/L As2O3 for 4 h. The cells were stained with 10 Amol/L H2DCF-DA
for 10 min or 10 Amol/L dihydroethidium for 20 min at 37jC and then
reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were analyzed using a FACS sorter.
Establishment of the stable cell lines overexpressing catalase and
CrmA. The cDNAs encoding human catalase were PCR amplified from
plasmids containing these sequences (kindly provided by Dr. Akashi,
National Institute of Radiological Sciences), with the catalase-specific
primers designed to incorporate a 5¶-hemagglutinin epitope. The respective
PCR products were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector
(Invitrogen), and the resulting constructs were confirmed by nucleotide
sequencing. U87MG cells were separately transfected with this generated
expression vector encoding catalase or an expression vector containing
CrmA cDNA (kindly provided by Prof. V.M. Dixit, University of Michigan
Medical School). Stable cell lines overexpressing catalase or CrmA were
selected with fresh media containing 500 Ag/mL G418 (Calbiochem).
Overexpression of catalase was analyzed by Western blotting using anti–
5¶-hemagglutinin antibody (Covance Research Products). Overexpression of
CrmA was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-CrmA (BD PharMingen).
Small interfering RNAs. The 25-nucleotide small interfering RNA
(siRNA) duplexes used in this study were purchased from Invitrogen and
has the following sequences: DR5, UACAAUCACCGACCUUGACCAUCCC;
CHOP, UUCACCAU UCGGUCAAUCAGAGCUC. Cells were transfected with
siRNA oligonucleotides using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Plasmids, transfection, and luciferase assay. The DR5/SacI plasmid
[containing DR5 promoter sequence ( 2,500/+3)] and pDR5/ 605 [containing DR5 promoter sequence ( 605/+3)] were gifts from Dr. T. Sakai
(Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine). Point mutation of the CHOP
binding sites to the DR5/ 605 promoter was generated by a two-step PCR
method using the following primers: mCHOP (5¶-CTTGCGGAGGAGGTAGTTGACGA and 5¶-TCGTCAACTACCTCCTCCGCAAG). Clone representing this point mutation was sequenced to ensure the accuracy of the PCR
amplification procedure. The CHOP promoter-luciferase construct (19) was
generously provided by Dr. P. Fafournoux (U.R. 238 de Nutrition Cellulaire
et Moleculaire, France). For transfection, in brief, cells were plated onto
60-mm dishes at a density of 5  105 cells and grown overnight. Cells were
cotransfected with 2 Ag of various plasmid constructs and 1 Ag of the
pCMV–h-galactosidase plasmid for 5 h using Lipofectamine plus reagent
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. After incubation for
24 h, transfected cells were further treated with or without As2O3. Luciferase
and h-galactosidase activities were assayed following the manufacturer’s
protocol (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized for h-galactosidase
activity in cell lysates and expressed as an average of three independent
experiments.
Statistical analysis and determination of synergy. All data are
presented as means F SE of at least three independent experiments. The
statistical significance of differences was assessed using ANOVA (GraphPad
software; GrahPad), followed by Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison tests. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Synergy of As2O3 and TRAIL
was evaluated by the isobologram method (20). The cells were treated with
different concentrations of each agent (As2O3 or TRAIL) alone or with the
two agents in combination for 24 h. The relative survival was assessed, and
the EC50 values for each drug given alone or in combination with a fixed
concentration of the second agent were established from the concentrationeffect curves. The EC50 values of cotreatment were divided by the EC50 value
of each drug in the absence of the other drug. In a graphical presentation,
the straight line connecting the EC50 values of the two agents when applied
alone corresponds to additivity or independent effects of both agents.
Values below this line indicate synergy, and values above this line indicate
antagonism.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and antibodies. Recombinant human TRAIL/Apo2 ligand
(the nontagged 19-kDa protein, amino acids 114-281) was from KOMA
Biotech, Inc. Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM), ethidium homodimer (EthD-1), 6-carboxy-2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA),
and dihydroethidium were from Molecular Probe. As2O3, N-acetylcysteine,
butyl-hydroxyanisole, Cu(II)-(diisopropylsalicylate)2, Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin, and 3,4-dihydro-5[1-(1-piperidinyl)butoxyl]1(2H)-isoquinolinone (DPQ) were from Sigma. The following antibodies
were used: anti–caspase-8, caspase-3, survivin, and XIAP from Stressgen;
anticaspase-9, caspase-2, FAK, Cdk2, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, DR4, CHOP/growth
arrest and DNA damage–inducible gene 153 (GADD153), Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL
from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; anti-PAR and BNIP3 from BD PharMingen; anti-Bid, phosphorylated Akt, and total Akt from Cell Signaling; anti–
c-FLIP (NF6) from Alexis; anti-Flag M2 and FITC-conjugated antigoat IgG
from Sigma; anti-DR5 for Western blotting from KOMA Biotech; anti-DR5
and anti-DR4 antibody for flow cytometry from R&D Systems; and antirabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase, mouse IgG, and goat IgG from Zymed
Laboratories, Inc.
Cell culture. Human glioma cell lines U87MG, U251MG, T98G, U343,
U373MG, and U251N were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (Life Technologies-Bethesda Research
Laboratories). The primary cultures of normal human astrocytes were
prepared from 14-week gestation of fetal cerebrum tissues as described
previously (18). Human astrocyte cultures were grown in DMEM with high
glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and 20 Ag/mL gentamicin, subcultured
every 2 weeks, and cell culture passage number of <5 were used in the
present study. Immunofluorescence study indicated that better than 99% of
cells expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein, a cell type specific marker for
astrocytes. Permission to use human brain tissues for research was granted
by the clinical screening committee involving human subjects of the
university.
Measurement of cellular viability. Cell viability was assessed by double
labeling of cells with 2 Amol/L calcein-AM and 4 Amol/L EthD-1. The
calcein-positive cells and EthD-1–positive dead cells were visualized using
fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200M, Zeiss).
Reverse transcription–PCR. Total RNA was extracted from U87MG cells
using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription–PCR
(RT-PCR) was done, following the manufacturer’s protocol (TaKaRa Shuzo
Co.). Conditions for final analysis were chosen when amplification of mRNA
was in the middle of the exponential amplification phase for 5 Amol/L As2O3.
Human DR5 mRNA was amplified using the sense primer 5¶-GTCTGCTCTGATCACCCAAC-3¶ and the antisense primer 5¶-CTGCAAACTGTGACTCCTATG-3¶ (corresponding to a 424-bp region of DR5). For CHOP,
the sense primer 5¶-CAACTGCAGAGATGGCAGCTGA-3¶ and the antisense
primer CTGATGCTCCCAATTGTTCAT-3¶ (corresponding to a 536-bp region
of CHOP) were used. For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), the sense primer 5¶-CGGCCATCACGCCCACAGTTT-3¶ and the
antisense primer 5¶-CGGCCATCACGCCCACAGTTT-3¶ were used (corresponding to a 310-bp region of GAPDH). The PCR cycling conditions
(30 cycles) chosen were as follows: (a) 30 s at 94jC for GAPDH and DR5
and 45 s at 94jC for CHOP; (b) 30 s at 68jC for DR5, 30 s at 60jC for
GAPDH, and 45 s at 52.5jC for CHOP; and (c) 1 min 30 s at 72jC for DR5
and GAPDH and 45 s at 72jC for CHOP, with a subsequent 10-min extension
at 72jC. Reaction products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels. The bands
were visualized by ethidium bromide.
Flow cytometry of death receptors. Cells were analyzed for the
surface expression of DR4 and DR5 by indirect staining with primary goat
anti-human DR4 and DR5 (R&D Systems), followed by FITC-conjugated
rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma). Briefly, cells (1  106) were stained with
200 AL PBS containing saturating amounts of anti-DR4 or anti-DR5
antibody on ice for 30 min. After incubation, cells were washed twice
and reacted with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG on ice for 30 min.
After washing with PBS, the expressions of these death receptors were
analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS; Becton Dickinson
and Co.).

addition, processing events of other caspases were not evident in
these cell lines. In contrast, treatment of U87MG cells with As2O3
plus TRAIL induced the cleavage of caspase-3 into the p20
intermediate form by 8 h and its subsequent cleavage into the
active p17 and p12 subunit after 12 h. In addition, precursor forms
of caspase-2, caspase-8, and caspase-9 progressively decreased after
this combined treatment. We further assessed the cleavage of
several key death substrates, such as FAK and Bid, which indicate
activation of caspases (21). Our results show that both FAK and Bid
were degraded from 12 h after the combined treatment, whereas
degradation was not observed after treatment with TRAIL or As2O3
alone. In addition, similar but faster activation patterns of caspases
were observed in U251MG cells in response to As2O3 and TRAIL.
These results suggest that, in these glioma cells lines, TRAIL
resistance may be associated with a blockade in the proteolytic
processing of procaspase-3 and a failure to stimulate the
subsequent caspase signaling cascade. Cotreatment of glioma
cells with As2O3 may contribute to the relief of the proteolytic
processing blockade. To investigate the functional role of caspases, we examined the effect of overexpressing the viral
caspase-8 inhibitor CrmA (22) on As2O3/TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
We found that overexpression of CrmA completely inhibited the
cell death induced by the combined treatment (Fig. 1D). These
results show that caspases play a critical role in the As2O3/TRAILinduced apoptosis.
Neither BNIP3 induction nor poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
activation is important for As2O3/TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
Next, we investigated the underlying mechanisms by which As2O3

cell lines are resistant to TRAIL (7, 8). In this study, we initially
investigated whether As2O3 could sensitize these glioma cells to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. As such, six different glioma cell lines
were treated with As2O3 alone, TRAIL alone, or with both As2O3
and TRAIL for 24 h. Calcein-AM and EthD-1 assessment showed
that cell viability was not significantly decreased by treatment with
As2O3 alone or by TRAIL alone (Fig. 1A). However, the viability of
cells significantly decreased when these factors were used in
combination, both when fixing the concentration of TRAIL and
varying the concentrations of As2O3 and conversely when fixing the
concentration of As 2O3 and varying TRAIL concentrations
(Fig. 1A). Furthermore, synergistic effect, as determined by isobologram analysis (20), was observed for As2O3 and TRAIL in
U87MG cells and U251MG cells (Fig. 1B). These results show that
the combined treatment of TRAIL-resistant glioma cells with As2O3
and TRAIL very effectively induces cell death.
Cotreatment with As2O3 and TRAIL recovers incomplete
activation of caspases in TRAIL-resistant glioma cells. Next, we
examined whether the sensitizing effect of As2O3 on TRAILmediated cell death was associated with the activation of caspases.
To do this, U251MG or U87MG cells were treated with 5 Amol/L
As2O3 or 100 ng/mL TRAIL alone or pretreated with As2O3 followed
by TRAIL exposure for the indicated times. Treatment of cells with
5 Amol/L As2O3 alone did not induce any proteolytic processing of
caspases in either cell line (Fig. 1C). In contrast, a 8-h exposure of
U87MG to TRAIL led to a partial cleavage of the 32-kDa
procaspase-3 into a 20-kDa intermediate form (p20), but not to
further cleavage of this form into the active p17 subunit. In

Sensitization of TRAIL-Mediated Apoptosis by Arsenic Trioxide

FACS analysis also showed that the cell surface expression of DR5,
but not DR4, was significantly increased in U87MG cells treated
with As2O3 (Fig. 3C). To clarify whether DR5 up-regulation is
critical for As2O3-stimulated TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we examined the effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of DR5 expression
on this process. We found that suppression of DR5 expression
by transfection with three kinds of siRNAs effectively inhibited
As2O3-stimulated TRAIL-induced cell death in U87MG cells
(Fig. 3D). These results support the idea that As2O3-induced upregulation of DR5 is critical for establishing of TRAIL sensitivity in
these glioma cells.
ROS generation is not involved in the As2O3/TRAILmediated apoptosis. Recently, we reported that sulforaphane
sensitizes TRAIL-induced apoptosis via ROS-mediated DR5 upregulation (29). Hence, we examined whether As2O3-induced DR5
up-regulation is also dependent on ROS in this system. We
performed flow cytometric analysis to quantitatively detect ROS in
As2O3-treated cells using H2DCF-DA, the dye which fluoresces on
oxidation by ROS. Our results revealed that the fluorescence of DCF
significantly increased in U87MG cells treated with 5 Amol/L As2O3
for 4 h. This increase was similar to that seen in U87MG cells
treated with 250 Amol/L H2O2 (Fig. 4A). Flow cytometric analysis
using the fluorescent probe dihydroethidium, which detects
intracellular O2 production, also showed the significant increase
in O2 levels after As2O3 treatment. Interestingly, however,
pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine failed to inhibit
As2O3-induced DR5 up-regulation (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, pretreatment with a variety of antioxidants [N-acetylcysteine, vitamin C,
catalase, reduced glutathione, butyl-hydroxyanisole, Cu(II)-(diisopropylsalicylate)2, and Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin] had no effect on the cell death induced by combined
treatment with As2O3 and TRAIL (Fig. 4C). Overexpression of
catalase also did not block the cell death induced by this combined
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1). Taken together, these results
show that As2O3-generated ROS is not required for As2O3/TRAILinduced cell death.
The As2O3-induced DR5 up-regulation is CHOP-dependent
in glioma cells. To further investigate the underlying mechanisms
by which As2O3 induces DR5 up-regulation, the CHOP protein
was examined. CHOP has recently been reported to be involved in
the DR5 up-regulation mediated by several TRAIL sensitizers,
such as proteasome inhibitor and tunicamycin (30, 31). Our
results indicate that CHOP protein levels are significantly
increased from 4 h, both in U87MG and U251MG cells treated
with As2O3, and that this increase precedes As2O3-mediated DR5
induction (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, As2O3 induced CHOP upregulation in a dose-dependent manner in the U343, U251N,
and T98G cell lines, suggesting that DR5 up-regulation is also a
common response of glioma cells to As2O3. To clarify the
functional role of CHOP in As2O3-induced DR5 up-regulation,
CHOP siRNA was used. Whereas DR5 was up-regulated by As2O3
in U87MG cells transfected with scrambled negative control RNA,
transfection with CHOP siRNA significantly abrogated the upregulation of DR5 (Fig. 5B). Moreover, As2O3/TRAIL-mediated cell
death was significantly reduced by transfection with CHOP siRNA,
but not by scrambled negative control RNA (Fig. 5B). These
results therefore show that CHOP-dependent DR5 up-regulation
contributes to the sensitizing effect of As2O3 on TRAIL-induced
apoptosis.
We next investigated whether the As2O3-induced CHOP upregulation is controlled at the transcriptional level. Luciferase

enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant glioma cells.
Recent reports have shown that several intracellular proteins,
including survivin, XIAP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, are capable of inhibiting
TRAIL-mediated cancer cell apoptosis when present at sufficient
levels (23, 24). We first examined the possibility that As2O3 might
down-regulate the expression levels of these antiapoptotic proteins.
However, significant differences in the levels of the tested inhibitor
of apoptosis proteins (survivin, XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2) or
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) were not
observed after treatment with 5 Amol/L As2O3 (Fig. 2A). These
results suggest that the sensitizing effect of As2O3 on TRAILmediated apoptosis is independent of these antiapoptotic proteins.
Recently, BNIP3, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family (25),
was proposed to be involved in As2O3-induced autophagic cell
death in glioma cells (26). We found that the protein level of BNIP3,
in particular the monomer form of BNIP3, was rapidly and
significantly increased by treatment with As2O3. We therefore
tested whether BNIP3 is also required for As2O3-stimulated TRAILinduced apoptosis. However, siRNA-mediated BNIP3 suppression
did not affect the As2O3/TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B),
suggesting that the As2O3-induced BNIP3 up-regulation is not
associated with the sensitizing effect of As2O3 on TRAIL-induced
glioma cell apoptosis.
Kang et al. recently reported that As2O3 induces cell death in
human cervical cancer cells through poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase1 (PARP-1) activation (27). We therefore examined whether PARP-1
is involved in As2O3-facilitated TRAIL-induced apoptosis and found
that As2O3 induced significant activation of PARP-1 in U87MG cells
(Fig. 2C). However, pretreatment of U87MG cells with the PARP-1–
specific inhibitor DPQ did not attenuate As2O3-sensitized TRAILmediated apoptosis (Fig. 2C). This shows that PARP activation is
not important for As2O3-facilitated TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
Taken together, these results suggest that neither BNIP3 upregulation nor PARP-1 activation is responsible for the recovery of
As2O3-mediated TRAIL-sensitivity in glioma cells.
DR5 up-regulation plays a critical role in As2O3-induced
sensitization of various glioma cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. Very recently, Szegezdi et al. showed that As2O3
specifically enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in leukemic cell
lines, including ML-1, K562, and Jurkat, but not in other tumor cell
lines (28). These researchers showed that, in this process, As2O3
induced an inhibition of Akt, a down-regulation of the short
isoform of c-FLIP (c-FLIPS) and an increase in the cell surface
expression of DR5 (28). However, the functional roles of these
factors in As2O3-stimulated TRAIL-mediated apoptosis were not
clarified. We therefore examined whether these signaling molecules
are similarly regulated by As2O3 in glioma cells. We show that Akt
activity is down-regulated in U87MG, but not in U251MG cells
(Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the protein levels of the long isoform of
c-FLIP (c-FLIPL) were down-regulated in As2O3-treated U87MG
cells, and the protein levels of c-FLIPS were reduced in U251MG
cells. As such, neither Akt inhibition nor down-regulation of a
certain isoform of c-FLIP is a common response of glioma cells to
As2O3. In contrast, As2O3 treatment produced a progressive and
significant increase in the DR5 protein level, both in U251MG and
in U87MG glioma cells. However, this treatment did not alter the
protein levels of TRAIL or the levels of the DR4 TRAIL death
receptor (Fig. 3A). We further examined whether DR5 is also upregulated by As2O3 in other glioma cells and found that, indeed,
the protein levels of DR5 were commonly and dose-dependently
up-regulated by As2O3 in U343, U251N, and T98G cells (Fig. 3B).

assays, performed after transfection of U87MG cells with the
CHOP promoter-luciferase construct, showed that As2O3 increased the CHOP promoter activity in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis showed that
the mRNA levels of both CHOP and DR5 were significantly
increased after a 4-h As2O3 treatment (Fig. 5C). We also
examined whether the CHOP transcriptional factor activity is
critical for As2O3-induced DR5 up-regulation. To address this
issue, we compared the activities of three types of DR5
promoters after As2O3 treatment. These promoters were the
pDR5-SacI plasmid containing 2.5 kb of the upstream sequence
of the DR5 promoter, the pDR5-605 plasmid containing 605 bp
of the upstream DR5 promoter sequence, and the pDR5-605mCHOP plasmid containing a mutation at the CHOP binding
site of the pDR-605 plasmid. Whereas the promoter activities of

pDR5-SacI and pDR5-605 increased in a dose-dependent manner
with As2O3 treatment, the promoter activity of pDR5-605mCHOP was not enhanced by the addition of As2O3 (Fig. 5D).
These results show that the As2O3-induced DR5 up-regulation is
transcriptionally controlled by CHOP and that the expression of
CHOP is also induced by As2O3.
Human astrocytes are resistant to As2O3-induced DR5 upregulation and to TRAIL-induced partial proteolytic processing of procaspase-3. Next, we investigated whether the combined
As2O3 and TRAIL treatment of normal astrocytes affected their
viability. Our results indicate that these astrocytes are resistant to
either TRAIL or As2O3 alone (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the combined
treatment of human astrocytes with As2O3 and TRAIL did not
induce any significant cell death, suggesting that the sensitizing
As2O3 and TRAIL regimen may be preferentially toxic to glioma

cells and not to normal astrocytes. We then examined whether the
resistance of astrocytes to the combined treatment is associated
with a differential regulation of CHOP and DR5. Results indicate
that in response to As2O3, neither CHOP nor DR5 was up-regulated
in human astrocytes, whereas both CHOP and DR5 were dosedependently up-regulated by As2O3 in U87MG and U251MG cells
(Fig. 6B). We further investigated whether there is difference in the
TRAIL-induced proteolytic processing patterns of procaspase-3
between human glioma cells and astrocytes. We found that,
although the proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 was partially
primed into the p20 intermediate form in glioma cells, this process
was almost completely blocked in human astrocytes (Fig. 6C).
Taken together, these results suggest that the human glioma cellspecific effects, which include As2O3-induced DR5 up-regulation
and TRAIL-mediated priming of the proteolytic processing of
caspase-3, may explain the preferential cytotoxicity of the com-

Discussion
Previous studies have shown that As2O3 has a good therapeutic
effect with only mild side effects in patients with relapse/refractory
acute promyelolocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma (10, 32, 33).
Clinical activity and tolerance studies have indicated that As2O3based chemotherapy is a promising treatment option for patients
who are unable to respond to and/or tolerate other chemotherapy
regimens. Recently, As2O3 was further shown to have potential as a
novel treatment against various malignant solid tumors (14–17).
However, higher concentrations of As2O3 were required to show
the anticancer effect on malignant solid tumors compared with
hematopoietic cancers. Because high concentrations of As2O3 have
been associated with clinical risks (34), the use of lower doses of

generation, as shown using the fluorescent dyes, H2DCF-DA, and
dihydroethidium. Notably, however, the generated ROS was not
required for As2O3-induced DR5 up-regulation or for apoptosis
induced by As2O3/TRAIL cotreatment. Recently, Liu et al. reported
that combined treatment with As2O3 and TRAIL synergistically
induces apoptosis in myeloma cells, accompanied by an increase in
the surface expression of the TRAIL death receptors DR4 and DR5
(39). In addition, Szegezdi et al. reported that As2O3 sensitizes
leukemic cells, but not several types of solid tumor cells (including
PC3 prostate, HeLa cervical, and Colo205 colon cancer cells), to
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis (28). The same study also showed that

As2O3, in combination with other agents, may be a better option
for treating malignant solid tumors. Here, we show that subtoxic
doses of As2O3 in combination with TRAIL effectively induce
apoptosis in various malignant glioma cells.
Previous studies showed that As2O3 induces apoptosis of
hematopoietic cancer cells via various mechanisms, including
opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pores, as well
as activation of Bax, p53, and caspases (9, 35). One of the most
widely studied apoptotic effects of As2O3 is induction of oxidative
stress via generation of H2O2 and ROS (36–38). In the present study,
we found that As2O3 treatment of glioma cells leads to ROS

treatment, demonstrating that DR5 plays a critical role in As2O3sensitized TRAIL-induced apoptosis in glioma cells.
Notably, we also found that the CHOP transcription factor is
critical for As2O3-induced DR5 up-regulation, as indicated by three
lines of evidence: (a) As2O3-induced DR5 up-regulation is preceded
by up-regulation of CHOP at the mRNA and protein levels; (b)
As2O3-induced activation of DR5 promoter activity is abrogated by
a mutation in the CHOP binding site of the DR5 promoter; and (c)
siRNA-mediated CHOP knockdown significantly blocks As2O3induced DR5 up-regulation and As2O3/TRAIL-mediated cell death.
CHOP, which is also known as GADD153, is induced by DNA
damage–inducing stimuli (40) and is one of the most highly
induced genes during endoplasmic reticulum stress (41). However,
in the present study, we did not detect DNA damage responses,
such as phosphorylation of g-H2AX (42) or induction of GADD34

As2O3-sensitized TRAIL-induced leukemic cell apoptosis was
associated with Akt inhibition, down-regulation of c-FLIPs, and
increased cell surface expression of DR5. In the present study, Akt
inhibition or c-FLIPs down-regulation was not commonly observed
in As2O3-treated glioma cells, demonstrating the differences
between the As2O3-induced signaling pathways in leukemic and
glioma cells. However, we did observe significant up-regulation of
DR5, not only at its cell surface expression but also at its mRNA
and total protein levels, in various glioma cells. Given that TRAIL is
known to trigger apoptosis through binding to DR4 and DR5 (4),
the expression levels of these death receptors may play a critical
role in determining the intensity and/or duration of death
receptor-mediated apoptotic signaling in response to TRAIL. In
the present study, we found that transfection with siRNA against
DR5 efficiently reduced the cell death induced by the combined

effect of As2O3 on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Consistent with this
hypothesis, Song et al. have recently reported that the resistance of
human astrocytes to TRAIL-induced apoptosis may be due to their
low expression levels of DR4 and DR5 (45). Similarly, we found that
the basal expression levels of DR5 were much higher in various
glioma cells compared with normal astrocytes (Supplementary
Fig. S3). However, TRAIL resistance is also seen in a variety of
glioma cell types, suggesting that the TRAIL resistance of glioma
cells is likely to involve other intracellular signaling molecules.
In various glioma cells, we observed that the 32-kDa procaspase-3
was partially cleaved to a 20-kDa intermediate after TRAIL
treatment. However, further cleavage into the active p17 subunit
did not occur as shown in Fig. 1C, suggesting that TRAIL can prime
but not complete the proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 in these
cells. We did not detect proteolytic processing of other caspases in
TRAIL-treated glioma cells, suggesting a failure in the subsequent
activation of the caspase cascade. The protein levels of c-FLIP, which
is also known to confer TRAIL-resistance to certain types of cancer
(46), varied across the tested cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3).
However, the protein levels of XIAP and survivin were significantly
elevated in all tested glioma cells compared with astrocytes.
Therefore, consistent with our previous proposition (8), our results
suggest that elevated levels of inhibitors of apoptosis, such as XIAP
or survivin, may help block processing of the caspase-3 p20
intermediate form to the p17 subunit in TRAIL-treated glioma cells.
Whereas TRAIL may act to prime the proteolytic processing of
procaspase-3, As2O3 triggers up-regulation of DR5, leading to

(43) after As2O3 treatment (data not shown), possibly due to the
use of subtoxic doses of As2O3. In addition, we did not detect
endoplasmic reticulum stress response–associated changes (44),
such as up-regulation of GRP78, GRP94, or activating transcription
factor-4, phosphorylation of eIF2a, or splicing of XBP-1 in As2O3treated glioma cells, contrastingly with those in thapsigargintreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results collectively
suggest that the As2O3-induced up-regulation of CHOP and
subsequent induction of DR5 do not involve DNA damage or
endoplasmic reticulum stress response.
One of the critical factors determining the success of cancer
therapy is the ability to selectively kill malignant cancer cells while
sparing normal cells. In addition, successful chemotherapy relies on
the proper choice and combination of anticancer drugs. Thus, it is
necessary to identify combined treatments that yield maximal
synergistic death-inducing effects in cancer cells and only minimal
side effects in normal cells. Here, we found that normal astrocytes
were very resistant to the combined treatment with As2O3 and
TRAIL, whereas glioma cells underwent rapid apoptosis in the
presence of these drugs. Although further preclinical and animal
studies will be required to support the clinical application of As2O3/
TRAIL cotreatment, our results suggest that this combined
treatment may offer a safe and attractive strategy for treating
malignant gliomas.
Notably, As2O3 treatment results in a CHOP-mediated DR5 upregulation in glioma cells but not normal astrocytes, potentially
forming the mechanistic basis for the glioma-selective sensitizing

TRAIL-based therapy using DR5-up-regulating sensitizers, such as
As2O3, may offer a promising new strategy for selectively killing
malignant glioma cells while sparing normal astrocytes.

stimulation of the death receptor–mediated apoptotic signaling
pathway and subsequent completion of procaspase-3 processing.
Thus, TRAIL-induced priming of procaspase-3 processing may
sensitize glioma cells to As2O3 by reducing the apoptotic threshold,
hence overcoming the TRAIL-resistance of some glioma cells. In
contrast, normal astrocytes are doubly protected from TRAILmediated apoptosis, both by the lack of CHOP-mediated DR5 upregulation by As2O3 and by the lack of TRAIL-mediated priming of
procaspase-3 processing.
In summary, we herein show that glioma cells may be preferentially
sensitized to TRAIL-induced apoptosis via DR5 up-regulation.
