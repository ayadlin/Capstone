BACKGROUND. To the authors’ knowledge, the prognostic factors in recurrent
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients treated with second-line chemotherapy
have not yet been clearly identified to date.

METHODS. Between July 1992 and December 2003, 232 of 515 patients who were
diagnosed to have SCLC at the National Cancer Center Hospital East were administered second-line chemotherapy for recurrent disease. The authors retrospectively analyzed the relation between clinical factors evaluated at the time of
recurrence and the response to second-line chemotherapy or survival in these
patients.

Center Hospital East, Chiba, Japan.

RESULTS. The results of univariate analyses revealed that response was significantly associated with the performance status (PS) alone, whereas survival was
significantly associated with the PS, disease extent, and sensitivity to first-line
chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis identified PS (P < .0001) and sensitivity to
first-line chemotherapy (P 5 .0024) as the independent prognostic factors for survival. When the patients were grouped according to these 2 significant prognostic
factors, the survival of patients with a PS of 0 to 1 was significantly better than
that of the patients with a PS of 2 to 4 both among cases that were sensitive and
those that were refractory to first-line chemotherapy. Although the survival of
sensitive recurrent cases was significantly better than that of the refractory recurrent cases among the patients with a PS of 0 to 1 patients, no survival difference
was observed between the sensitive and refractory recurrent cases in the patients
with a PS of 2 to 4.

CONCLUSIONS. Both PS and sensitivity to initial chemotherapy were found to be
significant prognostic factors for survival in recurrent SCLC patients treated with
second-line chemotherapy. These 2 factors should therefore be used as stratification factors in future clinical trials. Cancer 2008;113:2518–23.  2008 American

lthough the proportion of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) among
cases of lung cancer has been decreasing in recent years, it still
accounts for 14% of all new lung cancer cases, and the actual number of patients was estimated to be 77,000 in the US and Europe in
2004.1 In general, SCLC is an exceedingly aggressive cancer, and
greater than 66% of patients have clinically obvious metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.2 SCLC is also extremely sensitive to
chemotherapy; therefore, the main treatment strategy for SCLC is

systemic chemotherapy. Currently, both cisplatin
plus etoposide (PE) and cisplatin plus irinotecan (IP)
are considered as standard chemotherapeutic regimens for SCLC.3,4 Despite the high initial sensitivity
to chemotherapy, the majority of patients develop
disease recurrence. The prognosis of patients with
recurrent SCLC is usually abysmal, and the overall
survival time after recurrence is reportedly 2 to 4
months.5
In general, second-line chemotherapy is considered for cases with recurrent SCLC, and a few studies
have reported on the efficacy of some second-line
treatments.6,7 For example, a prospective randomized
trial comparing oral topotecan with best supportive
care (BSC) revealed the benefits of treatment with
oral topotecan in terms of the survival and quality of
life.7
Although some studies have shown the importance of both response and the duration of the
response to initial chemotherapy in predicting the
efficacy of second-line chemotherapy,8-10 the number
of studies conducted to identify the prognostic factors in recurrent SCLC patients is quite limited. In
this retrospective study, we investigated the prognostic factors in recurrent SCLC patients administered
second-line chemotherapy to determine the factors
that need to be used for stratifying the patients in
future clinical trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Flow
Between July 1992 and December 2003, 515 patients
were diagnosed to have SCLC at the National Cancer
Center Hospital East, and 474 of these patients
received initial chemotherapy with or without thoracic radiotherapy. Of 474 patients, radiographic
response was observed in 409 patients, with 98
demonstrating complete response and 311 demonstrating partial response. An evaluation in April 2007
revealed that among these responders, 322 had
developed disease recurrence, 75 had maintained
responses, and 12 patients could not be evaluated for
disease recurrence. Thus, 387 patients (including the
322 with disease recurrence and the 65 nonresponders) were considered potential candidates for
second-line chemotherapy. Of these, 232 received
second-line chemotherapy, whereas the remaining
155 did not. There were no distinct eligibility criteria
for second-line chemotherapy, and the decision to
administer chemotherapy was based on the patient’s
general condition and willingness to undergo second-line therapy. The patient flow is shown in Figure
1. Among patients who received second-line chemo-

therapy, those who deemed to have stable disease or
not to be evaluable to first-line chemotherapy were
treated right after completion of front-line therapy.
All patients’ data were obtained from our database.

Analyzed Clinical Factors
The correlations between clinical factors evaluated at
the time of disease recurrence, such as the age (<70/
70), sex (women/men), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) (0-1 or 2-4), disease extent (limited disease [LD]/extensive disease),
sensitivity to first-line chemotherapy (sensitive/refractory), and response to second-line chemotherapy
or survival after disease recurrence were retrospectively investigated in the 232 patients. In this study,
patients who responded to initial chemotherapy and
developed disease recurrence more than 3 months
after the completion of chemotherapy were defined
as sensitive recurrence cases, whereas patients who
did not respond to initial chemotherapy or developed
disease recurrence within 3 months were defined as
refractory recurrence cases.
Tumor Evaluation and Statistical Analysis
Tumor response was re-evaluated by 2 physicians
(Y.H.K. and K.G.) using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).11 The survival time
was measured from the date of disease recurrence.
The survival curve was estimated by the KaplanMeier method, and compared by the log-rank test.
Comparison between each clinical factor and
response was performed by the chi-square test. Multivariate analysis was conducted according to the
Cox proportional hazard model. P < .05 was considered to denote statistical significance. All statistical
analyses were performed using StatView statistical

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The characteristics of the 387 patients who were
believed to be potential candidates for second-line
chemotherapy (of whom only 232 eventually received
second-line chemotherapy, designated as the chemotherapy group) are listed in Table 1. The patients in
the chemotherapy group were significantly younger
(P < .0001), had better PS (P < .0001), and had a
higher frequency of LD (P 5 .0476) than the nonchemotherapy group. Whereas the response to first-line
chemotherapy was significantly different (P < .0001),
the sensitivity to first-line chemotherapy was not significantly different (P 5 .1661) between the 2 groups,
and approximately 33% of the patients who received
second-line chemotherapy were refractory recurrence
cases. As first-line chemotherapy, 156 patients (67%)
had received platinum plus etoposide combination
chemotherapy, and 24 (10%) had received the IP regimen. The second-line chemotherapy regimens administered to the 232 patients are listed in Table 2. At
our hospital, the vast majority of the patients had
received some kind of platinum-based combination
chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, vincristine, doxoru-

The distribution of these regimens was similar in the
sensitive and refractory recurrence patients.

Predictive and Prognostic Factors
According to the results of the univariate analyses,
response was significantly associated with the PS
alone, whereas survival was significantly associated
with the PS, disease extent, and sensitivity to firstline chemotherapy (Table 3). Survival curves drawn
according to the PS and sensitivity to first-line chemotherapy are shown in Figure 2 and 3, respectively.
Multivariate analysis identified PS (P < .0001) and

sensitivity to first-line chemotherapy (P 5 .0024) as
the independent prognostic factors for survival (Table 4). The survival of patients with a PS of 2 to 4
(P 5 .005) (Fig. 2) and refractory disease recurrences
(P <.0001) (Fig. 3) was significantly better than that of
those who did not receive second-line chemotherapy.
In addition, we performed further analysis, in
which all patients who received second-line chemotherapy were divided into 4 groups according to the
combination of the 2 identified independent prognostic factors for survival: Group A (PS of 0-1/sensitive recurrence), Group B (PS of 0-1/refractory
recurrence), Group C (PS of 2-4/sensitive recurrence), and Group D (PS of 2-4/refractory recurrence). The survival curves for each group are shown
in Figure 4. The survival of patients with a PS of 0 to
1 was significantly better than that of the patients
with a PS of 2 to 4 among both cases with sensitive

(Group A vs Group C; P < .0001) and those with refractory recurrence (Group B vs Group D; P 5 .0001).
Whereas the survival of the sensitive recurrence cases
was significantly better than that of the refractory recurrence cases among the patients with a PS of 0 to
1 (Group A vs Group B; P 5 .0013), no survival difference was observed between the sensitive and refractory recurrence cases among the patients with a PS
of 2 to 4 patients (Group C vs Group D; P 5 .4252).
Among the 232 patients who received secondline chemotherapy, 29 received the same regimen as
first-line chemotherapy, and the rest received a regimen different from first-line chemotherapy. However,
these differences did not appear to have an impact
on either response (P 5 .7519) or survival (P 5 .5873).

DISCUSSION
Some studies have shown the importance of both
response and the duration of the response to initial
chemotherapy in predicting the survival of recurrent
SCLC patients receiving second-line chemotherapy,8-10
and currently it is widely accepted that recurrent
SCLC patients should be classified into 2 groups:
cases with sensitive recurrence and those with refrac-

tory recurrence.12 In contrast, Sundstrom et al, who
recently analyzed 19 clinical factors at both the time
of initial diagnosis and the time of recurrence, have
suggested that the PS at the time of disease recurrence, and not the sensitivity status to first-line
chemotherapy, was the only significant prognostic
indicator for survival after second-line chemotherapy.13 In this study, we investigated the relation
between clinical factors evaluated at the time of disease recurrence and survival after recurrence, and
identified both PS and sensitivity to first-line chemotherapy as being significant prognostic factors for
survival.
Some may argue that the survival time of the
patients with a PS 3 in this study was too short,
which might have strongly influenced the inferior
survival of the patients with a PS of 2 to 4 as compared with that of the patients with a PS of 0 to 1.
Although our study included 18 cases with a PS 3
among the patients administered second-line chemotherapy, the results of the analyses were found to be
the same even after exclusion of these patients with
a PS 3 (data not shown). This finding suggests that
the prognosis of the patients with a PS of 2 is clearly
different from that of the patients with a PS of 0 to 1
patients. The diversity of our second-line regimens
may be criticized as well, because the differences in
the regimens could have affected the patients’ outcomes. However, to our knowledge, there are no
comparative studies suggesting the superiority of any
particular regimen for second-line chemotherapy. At
our hospital, as shown in Table 2, mainly platinumbased combination chemotherapy is used even for
second-line chemotherapy, and various agents are
combined with platinum agents.
The results of the current study indicate that the
prognosis of patients with impaired PS is inevitably
poor. In such patients, no survival difference was
found between the cases with sensitive and those
with refractory recurrence. Does this mean that
patients with a PS 2 should not receive second-line
chemotherapy? A phase 3 trial comparing oral topotecan with BSC demonstrated a significant survival
advantage of oral topotecan, and such survival benefit was also found to be preserved for patients with a
PS of 2 who accounted for approximately 30% of the
enrolled patients.7 Conversely, with regard to the
patients with a PS 3, there is no evidence as yet to
suggest the clinical benefit of administering secondline chemotherapy. In our study, however, response
rates of 64% in patients with a PS of 3 (n 5 14) and
25% in patients with a PS of 4 (n 5 4) were observed.
These results suggest that second-line chemotherapy
might be beneficial for adequately selected patients

with a PS of 2, although the survival benefit is limited as compared with that for the patients with a PS
of 0 to 1. Further studies are required for precise
selection of criteria for second-line chemotherapy.
In this study, the survival of patients who
received second-line chemotherapy with a PS of 2 to
4 or refractory recurrences was still significantly better than that of those who did not receive secondline chemotherapy. However it was not surprising,
because the patient selection for second-line chemotherapy was performed pragmatically, and patients
who were thought to be unfit for chemotherapy were
not administered second-line chemotherapy. The
finding that the nonchemotherapy group had more
patients with a PS of 2 to 4 and refractory recurrence,
the 2 independent prognostic factors identified in
this study, suggests that our patient selection was
reasonable.
The prognosis of recurrent SCLC patients is generally poor, and to our knowledge no standard treatment has been established for these patients. In
addition to the randomized trial comparing oral topotecan with BSC mentioned above, 2 phase 3 trials for
recurrent SCLC have been reported to date.14,15 A trial
comparing intravenous topotecan with the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine demonstrated comparable response rates and
survival; however, intravenous topotecan yielded
greater symptomatic improvement for 4 of the 8
symptoms evaluated.14 In the other trial, comparing
oral topotecan with intravenous topotecan, no survival difference was observed.15 Currently, topotecan
is the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for recurrent SCLC. Recently, however,
promising results of phase 2 studies have been
reported for drugs other than topotecan for recurrent
SCLC. In particular, amrubicin16,17 and PEI18,19 have
been shown to yield excellent response rates and survival in not only sensitive but also refractory recurrent
cases. In Japan, a phase 3 randomized trial comparing
topotecan with PEI is now ongoing.
In conclusion, we identified PS and sensitivity to
initial chemotherapy as being significant prognostic
factors for survival in patients with recurrent SCLC
treated with second-line chemotherapy. PS was also
found to be predictive in terms of response. In future
clinical trials of second-line chemotherapy, both PS
and sensitivity to initial chemotherapy should be
incorporated as stratification factors. The survival
benefit of second-line chemotherapy is limited in
patients with impaired PS, even among sensitive
recurrence cases. Therefore, careful consideration of
the potential risks and benefits is required in the
treatment of these patients.
