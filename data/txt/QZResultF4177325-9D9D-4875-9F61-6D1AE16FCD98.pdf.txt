ABSTRACT
Over-expression of PDGF receptors (PDGFRs) has been previously implicated
in high-risk medulloblastoma (MB) pathogenesis. However, the exact biological
functions of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ signaling in MB biology remain poorly understood.
Here, we report the subgroup specific expression of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ and their
associated biological pathways in MB tumors. c-MYC, a downstream target of PDGFRβ
but not PDGFRα, is involved in PDGFRβ signaling associated with cell proliferation,
cell death, and invasion. Concurrent inhibition of PDGFRβ and c-MYC blocks MB cell
proliferation and migration synergistically. Integrated analysis of miRNA and miRNA
targets regulated by both PDGFRβ and c-MYC reveals that increased expression of
JAG2, a target of miR-1280, is associated with high metastatic dissemination at
diagnosis and a poor outcome in MB patients. Our study may resolve the controversy
on the role of PDGFRs in MB and unveils JAG2 as a key downstream effector of a
PDGFRβ-driven signaling cascade and a potential therapeutic target.

INTRODUCTION

[10, 13, 14, 44, 45]. Inhibition of c-MYC using either
siRNA or pharmacological intervention has been shown
to limit tumor growth in vitro [43, 46–49]. These studies
suggest that c-MYC plays a crucial role in MB biology.
Notch signaling, one of major determinants
regulating cell differentiation [50], is a critical pathway
regulating stem cell differentiation and tumor progression
[51–54]. Abnormal activation of Notch pathway was
demonstrated to induce tumor formation [50, 55]. A few
studies indicate that Notch signaling may play a role in
MB progression [53]; however, whether the regulation of
Notch signaling by PDGFR in MB has not been reported.
In this study, we analyzed the expression levels of
PDGFRα and PDGFRβ in primary MB for their associated
gene signatures. We further used MB cells to elucidate
their individual functions on cell proliferation, migration,
and invasion. Moreover, by combining miRNA profiling
with bioinformatics-aided target prediction complemented
by experimental validation, we identified a potential
novel therapeutic target, JAG2, which appears to act as
a downstream target of the PDGFRβ-c-MYC signaling
pathway. We further determined the expression levels of
JAG2 in MB tissues for its prognostic value.

Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most frequently
diagnosed malignant pediatric brain tumor. Approximately
30% of patients with MB are resistant to therapies and
prone to develop metastasis [1–9]. Several earlier studies
have shown that over-expression and/or over-activation of
certain genes such as PDGFRs and c-MYC in the tumor
tissues of MB patients are correlated with an aggressive
tumor phenotype and poor prognosis [10–14].
The activation of PDGFR signaling initiates events
that culminate in cell proliferation, survival, and migration
[15–19]. A plethora of evidence shows that the MB cells
with abnormal PDGFR signaling, attributable to the overexpression of PDGFRs or their ligands [11, 12, 20, 21],
or mutation in PDGFRα, are linked to metastatic disease
[19]. PDGFRα was initially found to be highly expressed
in metastatic MBs, and it was further proposed to be a
therapeutic target for metastatic MB based on the results
that metastatic MB cells lost their metastatic phenotypes
(reduced capabilities on adhesion and migration in vitro)
upon blockade of PDGFRα signaling using a PDGFRαneutralizing antibody and a MAP2K1/2 inhibitor [11, 20].
These results led to the proposal by MacDonald and
coworkers that PDGFRα is a bona fide therapeutic target
for metastatic MB [11, 20]. However, in subsequent
studies, the PDGFRα probe-set used in the microarray
analysis by MacDonald and his coworkers was shown
to detect PDGFRβ [12]. The controversy regarding the
roles of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ in MB has continued,
i.e., PDGFRα was deregulated in both the primary and
metastatic tumors in a sleeping beauty mouse model
of MB [22]. Taking earlier and more recent results as a
whole, it is evident that the controversy lingers and the
dispute remains unresolved.
MB tumors are highly heterogeneous. Based on
their molecular and clinical characteristics, at least four
subgroups, WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4 exist [14,
23–33]. Among these subgroups, the preferential survival
rates of MB patients from good to poor are: WNT>
SHH / Group 4>Group 3 [29, 34]; however, metastatic
MBs are found in all subgroups. As yet, the role of
PDGFR-mediated signaling has not been examined in
the context of MB subgroups, and whether PDGFRα and
PDGFRβ could initiate convergent or divergent events in
MB remains to be determined.
c-MYC is a proto-oncogene encoding a transcription
factor that controls multiple cellular events such as
proliferation [35, 36], cell cycle [37–39], and apoptosis
[40–43] by regulating the expression of its target genes.
Over-expression of c-MYC promotes tumorigenesis while
inhibition of c-MYC reduces tumor growth in vitro and
in vivo [10, 13]. It has been shown that over-expression
or oncogenic activation of c-MYC in MB may be also
linked to an aggressive phenotype, and MB patients with
elevated levels of c-MYC often have poor outcomes

RESULTS
Expression of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ is
associated with different prognosis in patients
with MB
To define the biological roles of PDGFRs in MB,
we analyzed the subgroup dependent mRNA levels
of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ in two independent, nonoverlapping gene expression profiling data sets [29, 56,
57]. As shown in Figure 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D and Table S1, the
expression of PDGFRα was elevated in WNT and SHH
subgroups (p < 0.001), while high levels of PDGFRβ
were found in a subset of tumors from all subgroups,
particularly high in SHH tumors (p < 0.001). We further
analyzed the expression patterns in 3 sets of data and
obtained similar results (Figure S1) [32, 58, 59]. Our
previous studies revealed that patient with WNT MB has
a better outcome than the one with SHH / Group 4 and
Group 3 MBs [29, 34]. Our results suggest that expression
of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ may be associated with the
differences in prognosis.
We next searched for the molecular signatures of
PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, and c-MYC in MBs using the R2
software (http://r2.amc.nl) by assessing the correlations of
genes in major pathways with cellular functions in five
cohorts of MBs previously determined by microarray from
at least more than 45 samples containing all 4 subgroups
of clinical MBs [29, 32, 33, 59, 60]. By analyzing the
KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)
pathway annotation in these data sets, we revealed that
several pathways were significantly associated with

PDGFRα and PDGFRβ expression, respectively, in
the five separate tumor cohorts. As shown in Table 1,
Supplemental Tables S2, S3, both the expression of
PDGFRα and PDGFRβ in MB tumors was associated
with signatures related to ‘ECM receptor interaction’,
‘Focal adhesion’, and ‘Pathways in cancer’. Notably,
distinct signaling pathways for PDGFRα and PDGFRβ
were also identified. For instance, ‘Wnt signaling

pathway’, ‘Hedgehog signaling pathway’, and ‘Hippo
signaling pathway’ were only associated with PDGFRα
expression; while ‘Cell adhesion molecules_CAMs’,
‘Apoptosis’, ‘NFĸB signaling pathway’, and ‘Cytokine_
cytokine receptor interaction’ were only associated with
PDGFRβ expression. These data suggest that PDGFRs
regulate distinct cellular functions in MB including cell
proliferation, cell death, and cellular mobility.

PDGFRβ instead of PDGFRα promotes MB
progression

but not PDGFRα is a critical element to promote
aggressive behavior of MBs. To understand the distinct
cellular functions elicited by PDGFRα and PDGFRβ in
MB cells, we further analyzed the expression of c-MYC,
a previously defined PDGF response gene as a key
determinant involved in cell proliferation [61–63]. In
cells featuring siRNA-mediated knockdown of PDGFRα
or PDGFRβ, we found that c-MYC expression was
reduced in PDGFRβ siRNA-treated but not PDGFRα
siRNA-treated cells, suggesting that c-MYC may be a
downstream target of PDGFRβ partially contributing
to the differential effects initiated by PDGFRα and
PDGFRβ (Figure 2D, 2E).

The distinct expression patterns of PDGFRα
and PDGFRβ in MB subgroups and the association of
distinct signaling pathways of PDGFRs in MBs led us
to hypothesize that PDGFRα and PDGFRβ have distinct
roles in MB progression. To functionally characterize
the biological impact of these signaling events induced
by the two PDGFRs, we assessed the effects on Daoy
and D283 MB cells in cell proliferation and cell death
in response to siRNA knockdown either PDGFRα or
PDGFRβ. PDGFRβ knockdown resulted in decreased
cell proliferation and increased cell death (p < 0.01;
p < 0.01, respectively), while treatment with PDGFRα
siRNA showed an increased cell proliferation and
reduced cell death (p < 0.05; p < 0.05, respectively)
(Figure 2A, 2B) in both Daoy and D283 cells. We also
checked cell invasion under conditions of PDGFRα and
PDGFRβ blockade using their respective neutralizing
antibodies. We observed that interference with PDGFRα
signaling promoted invasion, while disrupted PDGFRβ
signaling inhibited invasion in Daoy cells (Figure 2C,
S2). These results lead to the conclusion that PDGFRβ

Co-targeting PDGFRβ and c-MYC expression
reduces MB cell proliferation
Analysis of MBs using high-resolution DNA copy
number profiling showed that c-MYC amplification
was mainly found in Group 3 MBs (25% of MBs) [60];
while Grotzer et al. demonstrated by RT-PCR using a
cohort of 26 MBs that all MBs express c-MYC [44].
We thus also analyzed the genes in the pathways coexpressed with c-MYC in the 5 data sets [29, 32, 33,

59, 60] and our data suggest that c-MYC and PDGFRβ
activate distinct signaling pathways in MBs (Table 1,
Supplemental Tables S3, S4). Based on previous
reports that c-MYC over-expression is critical for MB
progression [10, 13], we reasoned that co-targeting both
PDGFRβ and c-MYC could maximize the suppression
of MB progression, especially in SHH and Group 3
MBs. On the basis of phenotypes and molecular features,
Daoy may be regarded as a SHH tumor, while D283
and D425 are considered as Group 4 and Group 3 MB
tumors, respectively [14, 23–33, 64]. All 3 cell lines
with detectable PDGFRs and c-MYC (Figure 3A)
were used to target both PDGFRβ and c-MYC
simultaneously using siRNAs against PDGFRβ and c-MYC,
and also pharmacological inhibitors, SJ001 (a novel
PDGFR inhibitor, also called cambogin) [65] and 10058F4 (it inhibits the c-MYC-Max interaction) [46–48]. The
specificity and efficacy of siRNA knockdown of PDGFRβ or
c-MYC or both were confirmed by Western blotting analysis

(Figure 3A). The results show that blockade of PDGFRβ
and c-MYC signaling using either RNA interference or
pharmacological intervention inhibited both MB cell
proliferation and migration (Figure 3B, 3D). Although
in Figure 2D, we show that c-MYC is partially regulated
by PDGFRβ signaling, the observation of that PDGFRβ
signaling affected cell migration more significantly than
proliferation, whereas c-MYC signaling mainly contributed
to suppression of cell proliferation, indicating that PDGFRβ
and c-MYC act on different pathways. Notably, SJ001 is
able to inhibit both PDGFRα and PDGFRβ [65], indicating
that PDGFRβ may have a decisive role on cell proliferation
and migration in MB when both PDGFRs are repressed
simultaneously. Co-targeting of PDGFRβ and c-MYC using
either gene specific siRNAs or pharmacological inhibitors
potentiated the effects on cell proliferation and migration,
as shown by synergism in suppression of cell proliferation
and migration compared to blockade of either c-MYC or
PDGFRβ alone (Figure 3C, 3D).

miR-1280 expression is regulated by PDGFRβ
and c-MYC, and functionally important for MB
cells

target prediction strategy as previously outlined [66, 67]
to analyze the potential targets of the highly regulated
miRNAs. Based on the number of potential interaction
sites between miRNA and its potential targets, the score
of sequence alignment at the 3’ UTR of the potential
target gene and available literature regarding the function
of the potential targets, we identified that JAG2 is a
potential target regulated by miRNAs under the control
of both PDGFRβ and c-MYC. These results suggest that
PDGFRβ and c-MYC likely modulate genes related to
cell proliferation and survival via certain miRNAs and
their targets, including JAG2 as a target of miR-1280.
To further test and validate the results obtained from
bioinformatics aided identification of miRNA target, we
treated MB cells with PDGFRβ and c-MYC siRNAs alone
or in combination and then analyzed the expression levels
of JAG2 protein by Western blotting analysis. A decrease
in JAG2 expression occurred in MB cells lacking either
PDGFRβ or c-MYC. An even more significant reduction
of JAG2 protein levels was observed in MB cells lacking
both PDGFRβ and c-MYC compared to either control or
knockdown of PDGFRβ and c-MYC alone (Figure 5A).
These results indicate that both PDGFRβ and c-MYC
regulate the expression of JAG2 via miR-1280 in MB
cells. This conclusion is further supported by the fact
that the level of JAG2 increased markedly in the cells
treated with a miR-1280 inhibitor compared to the control
(Figure 5B). To further elucidate the role of JAG2 in MB
biology, JAG2 was specifically knocked down using
siRNAs in all three MB cell lines (Figure 5C), and its
effects on cell proliferation and migration were analyzed
using MTS and wound healing assay, respectively. The
results showed that JAG2 knockdown in MB cells reduced
cell proliferation (p < 0.01) and migration (p < 0.001)
(Figure 5D, 5E). To determine the clinical significance
of JAG2 in MB, we analyzed the prognostic values of
JAG2 expression levels in 64 MB samples. We observed
increased expression levels of JAG2 in metastatic MB
tumors (Figure 5F, p < 0.05) and the expression levels of
JAG2 correlated with poor prognosis outcomes (Figure
5G, p < 0.001).

To find the common targets which are optimally
responsible for both migration/invasion and proliferation,
we explored the involvement of miRNAs in PDGFRα,
PDGFRβ, and c-MYC signaling in MB cells by determining
the miRNA profiles of Daoy cells without (Mock) and
with knockdown of PDGFRα (PDGFRαKD), PDGFRβ
(PDGFRβKD), c-MYC (c-MYCKD), and both PDGFRβ
and c-MYC (PDGFRβKDc-MYCKD) using the miRCURY
LNATM microRNA Array (6th Gen) platform. We observed
that knockdown of PDGFRα had little effect on miRNA
expression, while knockdown of either PDGFRβ or c-MYC
markedly changed the miRNA profiles (Figure 4A). Among
1497 tested miRNAs, 159 miRNAs were modulated by
PDGFRβ (57 up-regulated and 102 down-regulated);
125 miRNAs were altered by c-MYC (76 up-regulated
and 49 down-regulated), and 22 miRNAs responded to
both PDGFRβ and c-MYC. Comparative analysis of
the respective miRNA profiles revealed that among 39
highly regulated miRNAs, a subset of miRNAs including
miR-1280 and miR-1260 was concordantly regulated by
PDGFRβ and c-MYC (Figure 4A). Next we analyzed the
expression levels of miR-1280 and miR-1260 (two highly
regulated miRNAs by both PDGFR and c-MYC) by realtime RT-PCR upon knockdown of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ,
each separately or both combined, in three MB cell lines
(Daoy, D283, and D425). The results agreed with the data
generated by miRNA profiling analysis (Figure 4B). To
determine the biological functions of miR-1280 and miR1260 in MB cells, PDGFRβKD Daoy cells were treated
with either a miR-1280 inhibitor or a miR-1260 inhibitor,
and cells were then analyzed for miR-1280 or miR-1260
expression, cell proliferation, and migration. We found that
both miR-1280 and miR-1260 inhibitors down-regulated
the expression of miR-1280 and miR-1260 (Figure 4C, 4D),
respectively, in PDGFRβKD Daoy cells. Notably, treatment
with the miR-1280 inhibitor restored the cellular function
of PDGFRβKD cells; while the miR-1260 inhibitor had less
pronounced effects on both cell proliferation and migration.
Thus, we selected miR-1280 for the further investigation.
In response to miR-1280 inhibition, PDGFRβKD cells
showed 15% and 55% increases in cell proliferation and in
cell migration (Figure 4E, 4F), respectively. Taken together,
these results provide a strong support that PDGFRα and
PDGFRβ regulate different molecular downstream targets,
resulting in distinct functional roles for MB progression.

DISCUSSION
Over-expression of PDGFRs has been considered
as a hallmark feature of MB metastasis and thus as
therapeutic targets in high-risk MBs [10–14]. In this study,
we found that the expression of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ
in MBs is subgroup specific and associated with distinct
molecular signatures; and only elevated level of PDGFRβ
is linked with an aggressive phenotype of MB in vitro
experiments. We present data showing that PDGFRα and
PDGFRβ differentially regulate MB cellular functions with PDGFRα limiting and PDGFRβ promoting cell
proliferation, survival, and migration/invasion. Through
targeting PDGFRβ and c-MYC, we revealed that the

using paired t-test, sample vs. control (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). (F) The expression of JAG2 in MB tissues of different stages of metastasis

biological effects of PDGFRβ appear to be orchestrated
by novel mediators including the miR-1280-JAG2 axis,
which enhanced MB proliferation and migration in
vitro. We further showed that the expression of JAG2 is
correlated with the stages of MB metastasis and associated
with a poor outcome in MB patients, indicating that JAG2
is a novel potential target. Thus our mechanistic studies
on PDGFRβ promoting MB growth and migration via
miRNAs and miRNA targets provide new insight that may
help resolve the long-standing controversy on the role of
PDGFRs in MB.
The notion that PDGFRα and PDGFRβ contain
well-conserved structure and display largely redundant
functions has been documented and generally accepted.
However, in this study, we present data showing that
PDGFRα and PDGFRβ play distinct roles in MB cells by
differentially regulating MB cellular functions. Notably,
structure-function analysis of the two PDGFRs shows that
although they share 70% homologues in the N-termini and
80% in the C-termini of the kinase domain [68], significant
differences exist in their ligand binding domain (31%
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

identical) and a sub-domain located at the C-terminal
region (27–28% homologues). These dissimilar structural
features presumably can account for, at least in part,
how the two receptors show differential ligand binding
specificity and affinity and additionally, interaction with
unique target protein sets to mediate starkly distinct
functions in vitro [69] and in vivo [68, 70, 71].
Oncogenic activation of the c-MYC gene is
commonly observed in MBs [13, 14, 72, 73] and overexpression of c-MYC is one of the critical features of
Group 3 MBs [25, 60]. The subset of MB patients with
17p loss and higher levels of c-MYC is characterized by
shorter survival [14]. Notably, majority of the MB cell
lines established from pediatric MB patients express high
levels of c-MYC [13, 72]. Based on our current study, the
over-expression of c-MYC in MB could be partially due to
abnormal PDGFR signaling because c-MYC is a PDGFRβ
downstream target (Figure 2D). Although c-MYC
expression is partially regulated by PDGFRβ, c-MYC
and PDGFRβ regulate cellular functions differently, since
PDGFRβ siRNA or inhibitor had a greater inhibitory effect

on migration, while c-MYC siRNA or inhibitor primarily
blocked MB cell proliferation. Importantly, only blockade
of PDGFRβ showed significant effects on limiting cell
invasion (Figure 2C), suggesting that PDGFRβ may
play a more critical role in MB invasion. Although our
current data from patients with MB that high levels of
PDGFRβ are mainly observed in SHH tumors, high
levels of PDGFRβ also exist in other subgroups and all
cell lines tested in this study (Figure 1D, 3A). Therefore,
targeting both PDGFR and c-MYC might provide a
novel therapeutic strategy for treating MB. Indeed, we
have demonstrated that the combined inhibition of both
PDGFRβ and c-MYC using either gene-specific siRNAs
or pharmacological inhibitors showed additive inhibitory
effects on both MB cell proliferation and migration
compared to single knockdown of either PDGFRβ or
c-MYC (Figure 3C, 3D).
MicroRNAs provide an important mechanism
for modulating signaling pathways [74–78]. While
analysis the PDGFR specific signatures in MB tumors,
we noticed the results from 2 out of 5 data sets showing
that PDGFRβ, but not PDGFRα, was associated with
miRNA_in_cancer (Tables S2, S3). Our array knockdown
analysis of individual PDGFRs also show that PDGFRα
signaling has little effects on miRNA regulation in the
tested cells (Figure 4A). Through miRNA profiling, target
prediction and validation, we revealed that PDGFRβ and
c-MYC may modulate MB biology via a set of highly
regulated miRNAs (Figure 4A) and miRNA targets.
Notably, Schopman et al. showed that miR-1280 might be
a fragment of a tRNA based on their sequence similarity
and annotation [79]. We first confirmed the expression
of miR-1280 in different MB cell lines that responded to
knockdown of PDGFRα, PDGFRβ or c-MYC. We further
demonstrated that the miR-1280 inhibitor suppressed the
expression of miR-1280 in MB cells (Figure 4C), and that
this suppression had a more pronounced effect on cellular
motility than proliferation (Figure 4E, 4F). Knockdown of
either PDGFRβ, c-MYC alone or in combination provided
evidence of an inverse correlation between the expression

levels of miR-1280 and its expected target, JAG2 (Figure
4B, 5A). The expression of JAG2 in MB cells regulated
by miR-1280 was further confirmed in studies using a
miR-1280 inhibitor (Figure 5B). These results support
the notion that JAG2 is a bona fide target of miR-1280.
Furthermore, the effects of JAG2 siRNA phenocopied the
functional effects of the miR-1280 inhibitor on Daoy cell
proliferation and migration in the current study. Now, we
have direct evidence that JAG2 is involved in PDGFRβ
and c-MYC signaling, supporting the novel PDGFRβ-cMYC-JAG2 regulatory axis in MB growth and migration
(Figure 6). Our findings are in line with a recent paper
indicating that Notch signaling and c-MYC signaling
transduction are linked in MBs [80]. However, it further
extends this report by suggesting an upstream regulatory
role PDGFRβ in this signaling network and delineating
that miR-1280 has an important role in the transcriptional
regulation of JAG2. Further, here we demonstrate for the
first time that JAG2 is regulated by PDGFRB and c-MYC
and there is an immediate functional impact of JAG2
abrogation in MBs. Given that c-MYC is a well-known
driver of oncogenesis in many models and cancer types,
and that JAG2 is a c-MYC-regulated gene [81], the
PDGFRβ-c-MYC-JAG2 pathways would be a logical and
expected mechanism of MB carcinogenesis.
JAG2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that binds
to notch receptors regulating cell proliferation and
differentiation in both normal and pathological conditions
[50, 82, 83]. The significance of Notch signaling in MB
has been demonstrated by employing inhibitors designed
to suppress various key regulators playing important
roles in the Notch pathway, wherein accompanying
changes manifested as a reduction in cell proliferation
and increase in apoptosis were observed [51–53], thus
implicating Notch signaling as a target that may constitute
an additional promising treatment strategy for MB
patients. By inference, therefore, it may be proposed
that co-targeting of Notch and PDGFR signaling should
constitute a more promising effective therapeutic modality
for MB, particularly since previous data show that Notch1

inhibition may not be sufficiently robust to achieve tumor
control in a small cohort of pre-treated, relapsed MBs [84].
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that
PDGFRβ, not PDGFRα, plays an essential role in MB
biology. The promoting of MB progression by PDGFRβ
and c-MYC could through their several downstream
effectors, among which a set of miRNAs, e.g., miR1280, and concomitantly up-regulates the expression
of tumorigenic factors, e.g., JAG2 are important
contributors. As the existence of PDGFRβ and c-MYC
expression MBs, simultaneous inhibition of PDGFRβ and
c-MYC signaling in MB cells synergistically suppresses
both cell migration and cell proliferation. We further
revealed that the expression of JAG2 is linked with MB
metastasis and patients with a poor outcome. Finally, our
results proffer the therapeutic tenet that co-targeting of
PDGFRβ and c-MYC, or PDGFRβ and Notch signaling
may represent novel therapeutic strategies for the
treatment of MB.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analysis of PDGFRs, c-MYC, and JAG2
expression in primary MB

Cell proliferation

Using the R2 software (http://r2.amc.nl), we
analyzed candidate gene expression levels in primary
MBs and normal cerebellar samples, and correlated
gene expression patterns with subgroup annotation to a
recently published gene expression profiling study [29,
32, 57–59]. The specific pathways associated with the
expression of PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, and c-MYC in MBs
were analyzed in 5 available complete data sets in the
R2 database using the KEGG pathway finder option. The
pathways that show significant (p ≤ 0.01, chi-squared
test) enrichment based on the genes co-expressed with
PDGFRs were identified and specific pathways found in
at least 2 of 5 data sets were ordered [29, 32, 33, 59, 60].
In addition to standard descriptive and graphical analyses,
qualitative and quantitative association of variables
was also evaluated by one-way ANOVA or the MannWhitney test, respectively. Survival was measured from
the time of initial diagnosis to the date of death or the
date of last follow up. Survival distribution was estimated
according to the Kaplan-Meier method using optimal
cut-off selection and log-rank statistics with Bonferroni
based multiple testing corrections. P-values < 0.05 were
considered to be statistically significant.

Cells (2 × 104/well) were incubated in 70% MEM
with 10% FBS, 30% Opti-MEM with 15 pM siRNA, or
miRNA inhibitor (Applied Biosystems) and 0.25 μl/well
of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in 96-well plates. For the
experiments using inhibitors, cells were treated with either
SJ001 (cambogin, 5 μM) [65] or 10058-F4 (an inhibitor
that disrupts the c-MYC-Max interaction ) [45–47]
(Calbiochem) at various concentration as indicated in the
figures. At 48 h post-treatment, cell proliferation rates
were determined using a MTS assay (Promega).

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) based cell death
index
Cells (2 × 104/well) were placed in MEM without
penicillin and streptomycin a day before transfection in
24-well plates. After 48 h of siRNA transfection, culture
media were harvested for assessment of released LDH
using an LDH based toxicology assay kit (Sigma).

RT-PCR and western blotting
Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were
performed as described [69]. The antibodies were purchased
from various manufacturers: anti-human PDGFRα rabbit
antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-human PDGFRβ rabbit antibody
(Epitomics), anti-human PDGFRα mouse neutralizing
antibody (R&D), anti-human PDGFRβ goat neutralizing
antibody (R&D), c-MYC rabbit antibody (Sigma), JAG2
rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling), β-actin mouse antibody

Cell culture
Human MB cell lines, Daoy and D283 were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection and
D425 cells were a gift from Dr. Darell D. Bigner [85].
Daoy and D283 cells were maintained in modified Eagle’s

perform qRT-PCR using 20x TaqMan® MicroRNA assay
along with TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Applied
Biosystems) to validate the regulated miRNAs in MB
cells. RNU6B was chosen as an endogenous control.
Experiments were performed in duplicate. PCR was
performed using the following program: initial enzyme
activation at 95°C for 10 min, denaturation at 95°C for
15s followed by annealing/extension at 60°C for 1 min
for 40 cycles. Fold change obtained from Ct values using
2–ΔΔ Ct methodology [87] was converted into logarithmic
base 2 for statistical analysis. p < 0.05 was considered to
be statistically significant.

Invasion and wound healing assay
Boyden chamber 24-well invasion assay kit was
purchased from Calbiochem. Invasion assays were
performed as previously described [69]. Wound healing
assays were used to measure the rate of cell migration
[86]. Daoy cells were treated with siRNA, or inhibitor
as indicated in the Figures. Equal amount of scrambled
siRNA or solvent served as a control. At 36 h, cells were
detached, and equal number of cells was re-distributed in
a 48-well plate. After 48 h incubation, an artificial wound
was made using a 100 μl pipette tip by scraping across the
bottom of the well. The medium was changed to remove
all detached cells. Movement of cells into the wound
area was captured by taking images at 0 and 24 h using a
phase-contrast microscope (Olympus). Migration rates in
percentage were calculated by comparing the width of the
wound at 0 and 24 h in each sample against control cells.
Wound healing assay was not performed on D283 and
D425 cells as they are half adherent/half suspension cells.
Experiments were performed in triplicate. The results are
presented as percentage for wound healing.

MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling
Control shRNA, PDGFRα-shRNA and PDGFRβshRNA plasmids were prepared using a vector (pRNATCMV3.2/Neo) from GenScript. The plasmids were
introduced into Daoy cells followed by G418 selection.
The control cells (harboring a mask control shRNA vector)
and PDGFRβKD cells were used to prepare c-MYCKD and
PDGFRβKDc-MYCKD cells, respectively, using c-MYC
specific siRNA. Total RNAs were isolated from control,
PDGFRα, PDGFRβKD, c-MYCKD, and PDGFRβKD
c-MYCKD cells using the miRCURYTM RNA isolation
kit (Exiqon) following the manufacturer’s protocol.
NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific)
and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to assess the
quality of the RNA isolated. The samples were labeled
using the miRCURY LNATM microRNA Hi-Power
Labeling kit Hy3TM/Hy5TM (Exiqon) and hybridized on the
miRCURY LNATM microRNA Array (6th Gen, Exiqon).
Duplicate samples for each cell type were applied to the
array analysis. The quantified signals were normalized
(background corrected) using the global Lowess regression
algorithm and the highly differentially regulated miRNAs
were selected and presented in the heat map.
