Deregulated MicroRNAs in Multiple
Myeloma
Leonidas Benetatos, MD, PhD1 and George Vartholomatos, BSc, PhD2

MicroRNAs are short noncoding RNAS involved in gene expression regulation under physiological and pathological
situations. They bind to mRNA of target genes and are potential regulators of gene expression at a post-transcription
level through the RNA interference pathway. They are estimated to represent 1% to 2% of the known eukaryotic genome, and it has been demonstrated that they are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, metabolism disorders, and heart disease. MicroRNAs are known to act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in
cancer biology. The authors describe the current knowledge on microRNA involvement in regulatory pathways that
characterize multiple myeloma pathogenesis gained from in vitro and in vivo studies. These small molecules interact
with important factors such as p53, SOCS1, IGF-1, IGF-1R, vascular endothelial growth factor, NF-jB, and others. As
such, microRNAs represent an attractive therapeutic target in the context of multiple myeloma interfering with the
myeloma regulatory networks. Further studies are needed to better understand their role in myelomagenesis and

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs of 22 nucleotides that play important roles in gene regulation
during physiological or disease-associated processes. They are capable of binding to the mRNA of target genes, resulting
in translation suppression, and they are potential regulators of gene expression at a post-transcription level through the
RNA interference pathway.1 MiRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II or III in primary miRNAs characterized by a
stem loop structure; they are then processed in the nucleus by a complex of the RNase enzyme Drosha and a doublestranded RNA-binding domain protein named DGCR8/Pasha, resulting in pre-miRNAs. The pre-miRNAs in turn are
exported into the cytoplasm by the protein Exportin-5, and under the action of the enzyme Dicer and in collaboration
with the TRBP/PACT proteins become double-stranded miRNAs.2 Next in the maturation process, the 2 miRNA strands
are separated, and 1 of the strands connects with the Argonaut 2 (AGO2) protein within the RNA-induced silencing complex, where it acts as a guide to repress target mRNAs.2 miRNA genes are distributed in all human chromosomes except
for the Y chromosome. Half of them are found in clusters, and they are transcribed as polycistronic primary transcripts.
However, miR-18a represents a particular miRNA located in a cluster that is regulated independently from the other miRNAs in the same cluster, indicating that individual miRNAs can be post-transcriptionally regulated by factors that confer
specificity and function at various points during the biogenesis pathway.2,3
Some miRNAs are generated from noncoding transcription units, whereas others are encoded in protein-coding
transcription units.4 Almost 40% of miRNA loci are located in the intronic region of noncoding transcripts, whereas 10%
are located in the exonic regions of noncoding transcripts. miRNAs are also found in intronic regions of protein-coding
transcription units, which account for the 40% of all miRNA loci, including imprinted genes.3-7 One of the largest
miRNA clusters, including miR-127, miR-134, miR-342, and many others, is located in the DLK1/MEG3 imprinted
region, which contains about 40% to 50% of the currently known miRNAs.7 They are expressed exclusively by the maternally inherited allele MEG3, which encodes a noncoding transcript, with a tissue-specific expression pattern. It has been
suggested that they might be able to simultaneously reduce the expression of numerous genes in distinct cell types targeting

more than 100 genes contained in the human genome.8,9
Interestingly, both MEG3-imprinted and SNRPNimprinted genes presented an aberrant CpG methylation
profile in various hematological malignancies and were
associated with disease stage and overall survival.10,11
miRNAs play an important role in determination
and/or maintenance of lineage during development, and
most of them are not expressed in embryonic stem cells
but are induced during development in a tissue-specific
pattern.1 They are associated with phenotypic variation in
closely related species during animal evolution, and alterations in the regulation of miRNA target genes can be
expected to contribute in phenotypic variation such as disease susceptibility in humans.12 miRNAs act on a broad
spectrum of genes including numerous transcription factors already present in the metazoan ancestor, and it is
very probable that miRNAs contributed to the emergence
of animal phenotypy.13
miRNA expression falls under multiple regulatory
mechanisms, including post-transcriptional events such as
inefficient processing of miRNAs through Drosha or
Dicer. The genomic location of miRNAs also represents
an important regulatory factor, as many deregulated miRNAs are located in cancer-associated genomic regions.14
However, it seems that the most important regulatory
mechanism in miRNA biogenesis is the transcriptional
control of miRNA genes, which is driven by promoter
hypermethylation or global hypomethylation.14 In addition to the control of miRNA expression by epigenetic
mechanisms, miRNAs themselves can regulate the expression of the components of the epigenetic machinery, especially in cancer, as miRNAs such as miR-29 directly
regulate the levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3b, with consequent silencing of tumor suppressor genes.14
miRNAs have important functions that include regulation of development, differentiation, apoptosis, stress
response, and gene expression regulation.15 To date,
almost 9539 mature miRNAs have been described in various species varying from viruses to animals, and are estimated to represent 1% to 2% of the known eukaryotic
genome16; it has been demonstrated that they are involved
in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, cancer,
metabolism disorders, and heart disease.5 Another significant functional characteristic is that a single miRNA is
capable of regulation of >200 mRNAs, and a single
mRNA may be regulated by multiple miRNAs.16 Prediction of miRNA targets with the use of computational
programs including PicTar, miRanda, and TargetScan is
based on sequence alignment. However, these methods

have limitations in identifying targets, especially in animals. Other methods used to identify miRNA targets are
described elsewhere.16
MicroRNAs and Cancer
miRNA alterations have been observed in various types of
cancer, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS),
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), breast cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, clear-cell kidney cancer, cervical cancer, and others.17 miRNAs have multiple roles
in tumor formation, as they are capable of modulating oncogenic, tumor suppressor, and metastatic pathways
including c-MYC, p53, RAS, BCR/ABL, and TWIST1miR10b-HOXD10 pathway, whereas the expression of
miRNAs themselves can be regulated by oncogenes or
tumor suppressors.17,18 The aberrant miRNA levels in
neoplastic disease are caused by genetic and epigenetic
(separately or in combinations), transcriptional, and posttranscriptional modifications resulting in the altered cellular homeostasis and in a less differentiated cellular state,
which is a hallmark of cancer.19,20
Selected groups of distinct miRNAs were commonly
and concurrently up-regulated or down-regulated in distinct types of human cancers and were often associated
with distinct cytogenetic abnormalities; their deregulation
seems not to be a random event in cancer.21 Specific miRNAs, acting upstream or downstream of p53, or by repressing members of the BCL family, can result in successful
apoptosis in normal cells. In constrast, miRNA epigenetic
silencing could result in altered apoptosis rates, a finding
characteristic of cancer, and miRNAs can indirectly promote the synthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) by targeting HIF-1.22 miRNAs can act as oncogenes, affecting all hallmarks of cancer including neoplastic cell independence from external growth factors signals,
uncontrolled proliferation, and survival, and can result in
insensitivity of tumor cells to antigrowth stimuli. Single
nucleotide polymorphisms, and somatic and germline
mutations in miRNAs have been observed in patients and
experimental models of breast cancer and thyroid cancer,
and in CLL patients conferring oncogenic properties of
several miRNAs.22,23
The potential use of miRNAs as prognostic markers
in clinical practice has already been demonstrated, as
expression levels of miRNAs could predict the time to first
treatment in CLL patients, were associated with

879

Review Article

mutations of established molecular prognostic factors,24
and were also associated with overall survival in patients
with hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, colon
adenocarcinoma, lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and
melanoma.25 Moreover, miRNAs have been evaluated in
the context of chemosensitivity to assess the individual
chemoresponse in both in vitro and in vivo models.26
The measurement of miRNAs levels in plasma or
serum has rendered them useful in the diagnosis of solid
malignancies such colorectal cancer, lung, prostate, and
kidney cancer.21,25 However, it has not been elucidated
whether miRNA circulating levels are tumor produced or
represent a systemic response, and it is not clear yet which
is the best specimen among serum, plasma, and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells to be used for miRNA signature
detection.27
The important functions of miRNAs in cancer
make them an attractive therapeutic target. Therapeutic
modulation of miRNAs could be used to achieve clinical
benefit against cancer, as has been demonstrated by Kota
et al in their elegant work.28
MicroRNAs in Hematopoiesis: General
Considerations
In 2004 Chen and colleagues29 first established the connection between miRNAs and hematopoiesis regulation,
determining that individual hematopoietic cell types differentially expressed miRNAs, given that the same miRNAs were not always expressed in all lineages. Their
findings suggested that the specific miRNAs are induced
during lineage differentiation and could influence hematopoietic lineage differentiation in mice, although differences in the expression pattern of the same miRNAs in
humans have been reported.29,30
Moreover, 31 mature miRNAs were found to regulate hematopoietic differentiation-associated mRNA on
CD34Ã¾ cells, and especially miR-155 represented an inhibitor of hematopoietic stem progenitor differentiation.31 It has also been reported that members of the miR30 family by targeting the transcription factor PRDM1
regulate the differentiation of lymphocytes to plasma
cells.32 More than the deregulation of miRNAs, hematopoietic deletion of AGO2 or of Dicer resulted in disruption of erythropoiesis, with severe anemia, splenomegaly,
and maturation arrest of erythroid precursors.33 Aberrant
miRNA expression profiles have been reported in almost
all types of hematological malignancies, including various
types of NHL, Hodgkin lymphoma, CLL, AML, APL,
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and MM. The miRNAs

880

currently known to be involved in normal and malignant
hematopoiesis are described extensively in excellent recent
reviews.30,33-41
MicroRNAs in MM
MM is a chronic, still incurable, disease characterized by a
clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells. Numeric
chromosomal abnormalities, translocations, gene mutations, epigenetic alterations, and direct interactions
between malignant plasma cells and stromal cells in the
bone marrow microenvironment are all involved in the
pathogenesis of MM.42 The pathogenesis of MM is a
multistep process, with the primary early chromosomal
translocations involving chromosomes 14q32.33 and
4p16.3 resulting in the deregulation of the MMSET and
FGFR3 genes. These early chromosomal alterations are
observed in both MM and MGUS as well. As the disease
progresses, secondary chromosomal translocations and
gene mutations including activation of KRAS and NRAS,
complex karyotype abnormalities in the MYC gene, mutations in the TP53 and FGFR3 genes, and inactivation of
CDKN2A and CDKN2C. These genetic abnormalities
result in altered expression of adhesion molecules on
malignant plasma cells and consequent abnormal interactions between plasma cells and bone marrow stroma.43 An
extensive description of MM biology, clinical presentations, and treatment are beyond the scope of this report.
The potential involvement of miRNAs in the MM biology has become a promising field of research in an effort
to elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of the disease.
The first evidence of miRNA involvement was
reported in a meeting abstract by Al Masri et al,44 who
assessed miRNA expression profiles in both human myeloma cell lines and MM patient samples. They noted
that malignant plasma cells in both cell lines and patient
samples presented significant variation in miRNA expression levels (including miR-125b, miR-133a, miR-1, and
miR-124a) compared with those of healthy subjects.
Bakkus et al,45 also in a meeting abstract, reported
the expression of 10 miRNAs using quantitative reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR),
and observed higher expression levels of let-7a, miR-16,
miR-17-5p, and miR-19b in both MM patients and cell
lines in comparison with healthy controls, whereas for
miR-15a and miR-21 there were no significant variations
in expression among cell lines, patients, and control subjects. Down-regulation of miR-372, miR-143, and miR155 was also described. Importantly, mir-16 presented
higher expression in plasma cells of MM compared with

those of MGUS, indicating an association not only with
disease pathogenesis but also with disease progression.
In contrast to the previous results, miR-21 has been
identified as an oncogenic miRNA with antiapoptotic
function. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies
revealed that STAT3 is recruited to the miR-21 upstream
region in human myeloma cells in response to IL-6. miR21 transcription seemed to be controlled by IL-6 and
mediated by STAT3 activation in MM cell lines, promoting survival of malignant plasma cells. Ectopic expression
of miR-21 in the absence of IL-6 resulted in significantly
higher levels of nonapoptotic cells, providing evidence of
miR-21 contribution to the antiapoptotic function of
STAT3. These data suggest a cardinal role of miR-21 in
the oncogenic activity of STAT3 and therefore support its
involvement in myelomagenesis.46
The differential expression of miRNAs located
within transcription units in human MM cell lines and
MM patients has also been investigated.47 The overexpression of 3 intronic miRNAsâ€”miR-561, miR-335,
and miR-342-3pâ€”whose modulated expression was not
associated with genomic alterations, correlated with the
expression of their corresponding host genes (GULP1,
MEST, and EVL, respectively) and were also sense oriented with respect to their genes. The miRNAs and their
host genes were found involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, proliferation, angiogenesis, bone marrow microenvironment interactions, and migration, processes all
altered in MM. The authors concluded that miRNAs/
host genes are regulated depending on each other, and
their altered expression may contribute to the disease
pathogenesis.47
Picchiorri et al48 studied the expression of miRNAs
in plasma cells of patients with MM and MGUS, and in
MM cell lines, providing new data about miRNA function in MM. They observed that 41 miRNAs were upregulated and 7 miRNAs were down-regulated in MGUS,
with the most up-regulated miRNAs being miR-181,
miR-21, miR-106a, miR-106b, miR-25, and miR-93,
thus describing an miRNA signature that distinguishes
MGUS from healthy plasma cells. Their microarray analysis, further validated with Q-RT-PCR, revealed up-regulation of 60 miRNAs and down-regulation of 36 miRNAs
in both cell lines and MM patients, whereas 37 up-regulated and 37 down-regulated miRNAs were found only in
MM subjects in comparison with healthy controls. Upregulated miRNAs included miR-25, miR-32, miR-20a,
miR-93, miR-106b, miR-106a, miR-181a, miR-21,
miR-19b, miR-181b, and miR-92a. Interestingly, miR-

Cancer

32 and the miR-17-92 cluster were up-regulated only in
the case of MM and not in healthy cases or MGUS cases,
suggesting a potential role in the disease progression from
MGUS to MM, and probably representing MM-specific
genetic changes. The up-regulated miR-32, miR-181a,
and miR-181b, and the miR106b-25 cluster were found
to target and negatively regulate histone acetyltransferase
P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF), which is involved in
the acetylation of p53, and thus indirectly controls p53
activity in MM. miR-19a and miR-19b down-regulated
the negative regulator of the cytokine IL-6 pathway,
SOCS1, resulting in constitutive activation of the Jak/
STAT3 signaling pathway, whereas overexpression of the
miR-17-92 cluster negatively modulated the expression of
the proapoptotic protein Bim, contributing in myelomagenesis. The oncogenic role of miRNAs in MM was also
confirmed in a nude mice model in which tumor regression of transplanted tumors after treatment with miR19a/b and miR-181a/b antagonists was achieved, also
denoting a potential therapeutic use of antagomiRNAs.48
In their most recent report, the same authors identified a
subset of down-regulated miRNAs in MM that are transcriptionally activated by p53 and modulate expression
of the p53-negative regulator murine double minute 2
(MDM2).49 In MM cell lines treated with the MDM2
inhibitor nutlin-3a, the authors observed that miR-34
and miR-194 were up-regulated, confirming the dependence of both miRNAs on wild-type p53. Conversely,
miR-192 and miR-215 were down-regulated in MM
patientsâ€™ plasma cells and up-regulated after p53 reexpression with nutlin-3a. miR-34a, miR-194, miR-192,
and miR-215 expression were directly correlated with p53
protein up-regulation after nutlin-3a treatment and p21
activation, whereas miR-15, miR-29a, and miR-29b
expression appeared more related to down-regulation of
their repressor c-MYC than to p53 activation. Expression
of miR-194, miR-192, and miR-215 in MM patientsâ€™
plasma cells and MGUS plasma cells was consistently
deregulated in MM samples compared with MGUS samples. This difference in expression probably reflects the
involvement of the specific miRNAs in disease progression. The p53-dependent miRNAs induced a consistent
G0/G1 arrest in cell lines with high expression of MDM2
mRNA. In contrast, in cells lines expressing lower levels of
MDM2 mRNA were detected increases of sub-G1 fractions indicative of cell death, in cells transfected with
miR-192, miR-215, and miR-194. Ectopic expression of
the miRNAs studied in wild-type TP53 cells inhibited cell
growth and enhanced apoptosis, effects that could be

Review Article

related to MDM2 regulation in MM cells. The authors
have hypothesized that miR-192, miR-215, and miR-194
could target MDM2 expression. Overexpression of miR192, miR-194, and miR-215 significantly increased the
level of p53 and p21 after nutlin-3a treatment, and
expression of MDM2 protein was dramatically decreased
in both cell lines. Moreover, these 3 miRNAs, by targeting
MDM2, indirectly modulated the expression of IGF-1R
and its ligand IGF-1, influencing plasma cell migration in
the bone marrow. The assays performed demonstrated that
IGF-1R and IGF-1 were also directly targeted by miR-192,
and miR-215 and the protein levels were decreased. Ectopic
expression of miR-215 and miR-192 in IGF-1â€“treated cell
lines resulted in decreased cell adhesion, migration, and tissue invasion. The results were verified in a NOD/SCID
mouse model in which proliferated tumors were significantly suppressed. The nonuniform re-expression of the 3
miRNAs in all samples analyzed prompted authors to seek
other mechanisms unrelated to the TP53 gene. In the cell
lines studied, the miR-194-2-192 cluster presented promoter hypermethylation with consequent silencing of the
cluster, supporting the hypothesis that the transition from
MGUS to MM was favored by clonal selection of cells with
aberrant promoter methylation of the specific cluster.
Lionetti et al50 sought to identify in vitro, performing global miRNAs profiling, modulated miRNAs resulting from deregulated gene expression profiles or altered
gene copy number. They observed that the most common
copy number alteration was gains (losses were rarer), with
a minimum gain frequency of 12.5%. mir-548d-1 presented the highest frequency in copy number gains
(94%), whereas mir-130b, mir-185, mir-648, and mir649, interestingly all mapped on chromosome 22q11.21,
presented gene losses, with maximum frequency of 38%.
Interestingly, it was shown that 18 miRNAs were significantly more expressed in cells with a gain of the corresponding genomic regions than in cells without a gain.
On the contrary, 15 miRNAs were underexpressed in cells
with genomic losses/biallelic deletions. Moreover, it was
demonstrated that the expression of a significant percentage (18%) of intronic miRNAs in MM are modulated in
accordance with the expression of their host genes, suggesting that such association might contribute to MM
pathogenesis. In another study, the same group51 identified 26 different miRNAs that were overexpressed in MM
and plasma cell leukemia patients, and their expression
varied according to the translocation/cyclin classification
subgroups. Their study allowed the definition of distinct
patterns of miRNA deregulation, the potential regulatory

882

effects on their targets, and the prediction of the miRNA/
mRNA regulatory networks in molecular subsets of MM.
Specific patterns of miRNA expression could differentiate
MM with distinct and well-defined genetic alterations.
This latter finding was verified by another group,52 which
identified 11, 8, 7, 37, and 18 miRNAs differentially
expressed in MM patients with t(4;14), t(14;16), t(11;14),
RB deletion as the only abnormality, and cytogenetically
normal MM samples, respectively. A significant inverse
correlation between deregulated miRNA expression levels
and expression levels of the deregulated target genes was
also observed. Predicted miRNA target gene overexpression
correlated with miRNA underexpressed levels, and as target
genes were implicated in cellular growth and proliferation,
it can be deduced that down-regulation of these specific
miRNAs can assign malignant plasma cells a growth
advantage. There was no association between expression of
the selected deregulated intronic miRNAs and their host
transcripts, in contrast with previously published results.47
An important recent study evaluated the expression
of various miRNAs in relapsed/refractory MM patients
and in vitro.53 They observed that miR-15a and miR-16
expression was decreased, whereas miR-221, miR-222,
miR-382, miR-181a, and miR-181b expression was
increased compared with healthy subjects. Predicted target genes of overexpressed miRNAs included proapoptotic factors, tumor suppressors, cytokine signaling
suppressors, NF-jB suppressors, and tyrosine phosphatases. Conversely, predicted target genes of underexpressed miRNAs included AKT3 and its downstream
target ribosomal protein S6, angiogenic cytokines like
VEGF, the NF-jB activator MAP3KIP3 (TAB3), Jag1,
JUN, NEDD9, and Snai2, with the MAPK pathway
being most affected, whereas b-globin and d-globin were
among the most up-regulated genes. miR-15a and miR16 could regulate cell cycle by inhibiting cyclinD1,
cyclinD2, CDC25A, and the level of phosphorylated Rb,
resulting in G1 arrest, and also could induce reduced
expression of BCL-2. Moreover, increased phosphorylation of the inhibitory protein IkB in the cytoplasm of
pre-miRNA-15aâ€“transfected and pre-miRNA-16-1â€“
transfected cells was observed. These findings suggested a
putative role of miR-15a and miR-16 in the regulation of
both canonical and noncanonical NF-jB pathways.
VEGF secretion was significantly decreased in premiRNA-15aâ€“transfected and pre-miRNA-16-1â€“transfected MM.1S cells, compared with untransfected cells,
suggesting an antiangiogenic role for their mature counterparts. Pre-miRNA-15aâ€“transfected and pre-miRNA-

16-1â€“transfected cells inhibited migration in response to
SDF-1, whereas significant inhibition of adhesion of MM
to primary bone marrow stromal cells was observed. The
effect of miR-15a and miR-16 on migration was also evaluated in mouse models, confirming the in vitro results.
The importance of miR-15a/16-1 cluster inhibition in
promoting tumor progression by enhancing tumor cell
survival, metastasis, and angiogenic properties of MM
cells by up-regulating genes like NEDD9, Snai2,
MALAT1, and VEGF was confirmed. Moreover, absent
expression of miR-15a and overexpression of miR-181a
and miR-181ab correlated with poor prognosis in patients
with International Scoring System grade II/III.53 However, the findings of the study mentioned above on miR15a and miR-16 expression were contradicted by others,54
who reported that miR-15a and miR-16 were displayed at
a range of expression levels in MM patients that were
higher than in normal plasma cells, and that the expression of these miRNAs varied independently of chromosome 13 status.
The group of Roccaro55 recently reported, in
abstract form, miRNAs expression patterns in MM cell
lines cocultured with primary bone marrow stromal cells
and observed that miR-450, miR-432*, miR-299-5p,
miR-409-3p, miR-29b, miR-542-5p, miR-184, miR517*, miR-218, miR-128b, miR-142-5p, and miR-211
presented significantly increased expression in the cocultures compared with MM cells alone, and their predicted
targets were represented by negative regulators of NF-jB,
PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways,
such as PTEN, KSR2, TWEAK, DUSP, as well as various
tumor suppressors genes, proapoptotic factors, and
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.55
The members of the miR-125a and miR-125b clusters
act by inhibiting the differentiation of centroblasts in germinal centers, with miR-125b demonstrating a dominant role
because of its higher expression levels.56 miR-125b overexpression by down-regulating its target genes, BLIMP1 and
IRF4, facilitated BCL-6 maintenance of the germinal center,
thus negatively modulating the B-cell differentiation into
plasma cells, antibody secretion, and myeloma cell survival
in MM cell lines. Hence, impaired expression of the particular miRNA could contribute to MM pathogenesis.
miR-34a, a transcriptional target of p53 that mediates
cellular apoptosis, has been found epigenetically silenced in
MM samples.57 In particular, miR-34a was hypermethylated in 5.5% of the MM patients studied (no change in the
methylation status of miR-34a was observed during disease
progression), and was also hypermethylated in 37% of the

Cancer

February 15, 2012

MM cell lines, whereas no aberrant methylation was
detected in healthy blood cells. These results supported the
tumor suppressive function of the specific miRNA.57
Zhou and colleagues,58 in an analysis of both
miRNA expression and protein coding gene expression
profiles, observed that the total expression levels of 95
miRNAs evaluated was higher in the 52 newly diagnosed MM patient samples compared with those of
control subjects. Nine miRNAs, all located on chromosome 13, were overexpressed in MM samples compared
with normal samples, consistent with previous studies,48
and were also positively associated with risk score and
proliferation index. Their results indicated that higher
total expression levels of miRNAs might be associated
with disease initiation, with an inferior clinical outcome,
and with a high-grade undifferentiated stage of cancer
that appears to be more aggressive than the low-grade
stages. Notably, their findings suggested that although
single miRNAs could not contribute to disease progression, they could act synergistically, contributing significantly to disease progression. miR-106a, miR-106b,
miR-17-5p, and miR-20b were found to repress their
target CDKN1A/p21Waf1/Cip1, deregulating its function in cell cycle progression in G1. Silencing of the
enzymes AGO2 and Dicer resulted in decreased viability
of malignant plasma cells, further illustrating the potential therapeutic option.58 In particular, AGO2 silencing
led to cell cycle arrest in MM cell lines and enhanced
expression of p21Waf1/Cip1, p27Kip1, CDK2, and
CCND1, and finally induced increased rates of apoptosis
through activation of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9.
Similar results were also obtained when Dicer enzyme
was experimentally knocked down.
The miR-193b-365 cluster, present only in vertebrates, has also recently been described as a novel overexpressed miRNA in MM patients and MM cell lines59; the
deregulated expression of miR-17-92, miR-106b-25, and
miR-106a-92 was reconfirmed. However, the role of this
cluster in MM pathogenesis has to be elucidated.
Up-regulation and down-regulation of numerous
miRNAs has also been observed in the drug-resistant myeloma cell lines RPMI8226 Dox6/LR5 and U266 Dox/
LR7 (treated with doxorubicin-Dox6 or melphalan-LR5),
suggesting that deregulated miRNA expression might be
involved in the generation of drug resistance.60 The data
obtained from that study argued for the involvement of
multiple individual miRNA changes in drug-resistant cell
lines, or for random gains and losses of genetic material
during the induction of drug resistance.

Anastasiadou et al,61 to better understand the interaction between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and malignant
plasma cells, using an LNA-based miRNA microarray,
found that EBV-infected plasma cells could modulate the
expression of the 36 miRNAs reported.
Genes such as HOX9, c-MYC, BCL-2, SHP1, and
SHP2 represent targets of miR-146b, miR-140, miR-145,
miR-125a, miR-151, miR-223, miR-155, and let-7f, and
changes in expression of these miRNAs are thought to be
involved in myelomagenesis and are also associated with
overall prognosis.62
Neri et al,63 as they reported in their meeting abstract
in 2009, were the first to evaluate miRNA expression patterns that are associated with response to bortezomib. They
identified 22 deregulated miRNAs with overexpression of
miR-155, miR-342-3p, miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-128,
and miR-20b and down-regulation of miR-let-7b, miRlet-7i, miR-let-7d, miR-let-7c, miR-222, miR-221, miR23a, miR-27a, and miR-29a in bortezomib-resistant versus
bortezomib-sensitive cell lines. Predicted targets included
genes involved in cell cycle regulation, cell growth, apoptosis, and ubiquitin conjugation pathways. To investigate the
clinical importance of miRNAs, they correlated the
miRNA expression profile of malignant plasma cells from
bortezomib-sensitive and bortezomib-resistant MM
patients with their response to therapy. Their data analysis
revealed that the bortezomib-sensitive MM patients presented the same deregulated miRNAs as the sensitive cell
line, whereas resistant patients segregated into the bortezomib-resistant cell line cluster. Moreover, they described a
miRNA signature critical for MM pathogenesis and capable of prediction of response to bortezomib.
Most recently, miR-223 was reported to be downregulated in extramedullary plasmacytomas compared with
MM in patient samples, whereas miR-93, miR-181b, and
miR-30a presented similar expression. The deregulated
miR-223 expression and the CD19 positivity could distinguish MM from extramedullary plasmacytoma cases.64
miRNA expression profiling could be a useful tool for assessing medullary plasmacytomas and extramedullary plasmacytoma progression to overt MM, as has been determined by
Mahindra and colleagues in their meeting report.65
The potential antimyeloma effect of various drugs
by targeting and deregulating miRNA expression as a
mechanism of action represent an interest and promising
field of research. Two drugs, the cytostatic ribonuclease
Onconase (known to reduce tumor growth in animal
models with miRNAs being the intracellular targets of the
drug), and the alkaloid cepharanthine (used to treat

884

several acute and chronic diseases), as single agents or in
combination, have been evaluated in the MM RPMI8228 cell line.66 The cytotoxic effect was more pronounced when the 2 drugs were combined, probably by
targeting the family of miRNAs that provide tumor resistance to cytotoxic drugs through mobilizing the cell
defense mechanisms. Another possible explanation could
be the modulation of expression of target miRNAs associated with the p53 network.66 The recently identified histone deacetylase inhibitor ITF2357 is capable of inducing
apoptosis and inhibition of IL-6 and VEGF production
in malignant plasma cells.67 It is also capable of down-regulating miR-19a and miR-19b, both members of the
miR-17-92 cluster, with levels of inhibition ranging from
25% to 57% in various cell lines; it also down-regulated
the expression of the C13orf25 transcript, which is the
miR-17-92 cluster host. Hence, this particular drug
affects MM cells biology by modulating transcription regulation genes, cell cycle and apoptosis regulator genes,
genes involved in the tumor necrosis factor pathways, the
production of proinflammatory cytokines, and the expression of the IL-6R. Interestingly, in this study a novel
mechanism of action has been reported, delineating
decreased expression of miR-19a and miR-19b by the specific drug and consequently reduced tumor cell growth.
The development of a screening assay capable of
identifying miRNAs that negatively regulates p53 signaling through direct interaction with its coding gene
TP53 has recently been developed, identifying miR-25
and miR-30d as putative regulators of p53 function.68
miR-25 and miR-30d were overexpressed in plasma
cells from 31 MM patient samples compared with those
from healthy donors, and miR-25 expression was inversely correlated with TP53 mRNA levels. TP53 mRNA
was down-regulated about 60% or 85% with the introduction of miR-30d or miR-25. Introduction of
miRNA inhibitors into an MM cell line with a wildtype p53 gene resulted in an increase of endogenous
p53 levels, suggesting that dysregulation of miR-25 and
miR-30d is pathologically important for p53 function
in malignant plasma cells. The effect of miR-25 and
miR-30d on cell apoptosis was also evaluated; Bax, p53,
and p21 expression decreased with miRNA overexpression in the presence or absence of etoposide, and such
effect was attributed to decreased expression of caspases.
No significant alteration in PCAF or Bim expression
was noted, suggesting that miR-25 did not indirectly
contribute through modulation of PCAF or Bim in the
down-regulation of p53.

Conclusions
Since the first discovery of miRNAs in the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans almost 20 years ago, and 8 years
since the first evidence of their involvement in human
cancer,15 our knowledge has expanded enormously in
understanding their importance and significance in cell
biology and cancer pathogenesis. These small RNA molecules are present in several species, from viruses and plants
to mammals, are tissue and developmental stage specific,
and play pivotal roles in regulating the expression of genes
involved in development, proliferation, differentiation,
apoptosis, and stress response. Although the number of
studies reporting miRNA involvement in cellular biology
and in neoplastic diseases reaches some thousands, fewer
reports have been published on the involvement of miRNAs in MM. The purpose of this paper was to summarize
the current knowledge regarding the contribution of miRNAs to myelomagenesis, and prognosis and treatment of
the particular disease. The location of miRNA genes in cancer-associated genomic regions, the presence of epigenetic
mechanisms, and alterations in the miRNA processing machinery could explain the widespread differential expression
of miRNA genes observed in cancer cells compared with
normal cells69 and very probably in MM plasma cells compared with normal plasma cells. Moreover, several miRNAs
have been found up-regulated or down-regulated in MM
cell lines and patients, whereas for some miRNAs such as
miR-15, miR-16, and miR-21 the results were conflicting.
Discrepancies on miRNA differential expression among various studies have been reported, but that could be explained:
1) by the different platforms used for miRNA analysis; 2) by
sampling methods, as in some studies sampling was performed according to patientsâ€™ genetic abnormalities, whereas
in other studies there was no such distinction; 3) by the different sample sizes; and 4) by the different statistical analyses
regarding class comparisons and significance level (statistical
analysis of microarray-SAM vs t test).
The studies described here established the deregulation of several miRNAs in MGUS and MM in association with well-known pathogenetic factors such as IL-6
and SOCS1 activating the STAT3 pathway, and apoptosis-related genes, thus contributing to malignant
plasma cell survival. They are also capable of regulating
the MDM2/p53 autoregulatory loop, and indirectly the
p53 expression by targeting PCAF. miRNAs are also capable of targeting the IGF-1 axis controlling mobility
and invasion of malignant plasma cells, as demonstrated
by in vivo and in vitro experiments (Fig. 1). They also
act synergistically, contributing to disease progression;

genes and pathways, are shown.

their total expression levels are associated with clinical
outcome, and correlate with the International Scoring
System stage. miRNAs deregulate expression in MM
cells, and the pattern of expression in MM seems associated with specific genetic abnormalities. Moreover,
miRNAs observed in distinct genetic subsets characterized by chromosomal and molecular aberrations target
several pathways contributing to cell cycle progression
and cellular survival. Interestingly, different miRNAs
that are deregulated in different cytogenetic subgroups
putatively target the same genes.
Target prediction of miRNAs based on computational methods remains a challenge because of falsepositive results, and better approaches to identify predicted targets are needed.16 This can be deduced by the
observation that several miRNAs are identified to target
mRNA by the currently known methods, whereas fewer
miRNAs are found to deregulate experimentally reported
gene expression.16 It is important, however, to identify
target genes of miRNAs deregulated in MM, as miRNA/
mRNA interactions could be useful in identifying relevant
protein-coding genes involved in MM pathogenesis and
could also represent future therapeutic targets.
As it seems that miRNAs play a crucial role in the
pathogenesis of MM, development of drugs targeting
miRNAs and modulating their expression represent a
promising therapeutic approach.70 The development of
drugs targeting these small RNA molecules is under continuous investigation in preclinical and clinical studies.69
In conclusion, the studies reported here aimed to
place miRNAs into oncogenic and/or suppressive pathways to better understand how these pathways act in
myelomagenesis.
