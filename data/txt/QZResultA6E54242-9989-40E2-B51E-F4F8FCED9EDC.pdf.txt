BACKGROUND: Patients with mucosal and acral melanomas have limited treatment options and a poor prognosis. Mutations of the
KIT oncogene in these melanoma subtypes provide a potential therapeutic target. METHODS: A multicenter phase 2 trial of sunitinib
was conducted in patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma of a mucosal or acral primary origin. Patients were treated in 2
cohorts: cohort A received sunitinib at a dose of 50 mg daily for 4 weeks of a 6-week cycle, and cohort B received sunitinib at a
dose of 37.5 mg daily on a continuous basis. Dose reductions were permitted for treatment-related toxicities, and tumor assessments
were performed every 2 months. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled: 21 in cohort A and 31 in cohort B. Four patients had confirmed partial responses, which lasted 5 to 10 months (1 with a KIT mutation). In both cohorts, the proportion of patients alive and
progression-free at 2 months was 52% (95% confidence interval, 38%-66%); this was significantly larger than the hypothesized null of
5%. There was no significant difference in response or overall survival between the 25% of patients with a KIT mutation and those
without one (response rate, 7.7% vs 9.7%; overall survival, 6.4 vs 8.6 months). The overall disease control rate was 44%, and a high
rate of toxicity was associated with the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib showed activity in the treatment of mucosal and acral
melanoma that was not dependent on the presence of a KIT mutation. However, the medication was poorly tolerated, and there were

INTRODUCTION
Clinical behavior and molecular characterization have shown that melanomas arising from mucosal membranes and acral
skin are biologically different than the more common cutaneous melanomas. Mucosal and acral melanomas also have
high rates of recurrence after initial surgery, and the prognosis at recurrence is very poor.1-3 A better understanding and
improved therapeutics are needed for these subtypes of melanoma.
Within the groups of melanomas including mucosal, acral, and skin melanomas with chronic sun damage, mutations
and amplification of the KIT oncogene are more prevalent in comparison with the more common cutaneous melanomas.4
KIT gene expression has been correlated with activating mutations, which indicates the pertinent role of KIT in tumorigenesis in mucosal melanoma.5 There have been several trials using KIT-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors in melanoma
in both selected and nonselected patient populations. Trials of imatinib demonstrated responses if KIT was mutated but
not if it was wild-type and amplified.6-8 A phase 2 trial of dasatinib showed minimal activity in melanoma.9
Another potential target in the treatment of melanoma is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF plays a
role in the pathogenesis, growth, and metastatic progression of melanoma.10,11 Antiangiogenic agents have shown some
clinical efficacy in the treatment of melanoma, with combination therapies being the most promising.12-14
Sunitinib (Sutent) is an orally administered inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, including VEGF receptor, platelet-derived
growth factor receptor, KIT, RET, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor, and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3.15 Sunitinib

has activity in metastatic renal cell cancer and in gastrointestinal stromal tumors refractory to imatinib.16,17 We
conducted a multicenter trial of sunitinib in patients with
metastatic mucosal or acral melanoma.

Because of the extended time period for enrollment in this
rare patient population, the study was closed to accrual in
August 2013, at which time there were 21 participants in
cohort A and 31 participants in cohort B.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility

Assessment of Toxicity and Response

Eligible patients had histologically confirmed stage III
unresectable melanoma or stage IV melanoma of a mucosal or acral primary origin, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, normal end
organ function, and measurable disease (defined as at least
1 lesion 1 cm in its greatest dimension). In addition, tissue
blocks or slides were required of either the primary or
metastatic tumor site for KIT mutational testing. This
was an unselected population because of a lower mutational rate than previously reported, limited resources
available for sequencing analyses, and the potential for
anti-VEGF effects with sunitinib. Patients who had
known brain metastases or had been previously treated
with antiangiogenic agents were excluded from the study.

Safety and tolerability were evaluated according to the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). Treatment was held
for a grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity and resumed at the
same daily dose when this was resolved to grade 1 or
lower. If the grade 3 toxicity recurred or a grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred, the drug was held until this
was resolved to grade 1 or lower, and it resumed with a
12.5-mg dose reduction.
Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and magnetic resonance imaging of the
brain were performed before treatment, and restaging
scans were obtained every 2 months after the initiation of
treatment. In addition, a fludeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan was performed during screening and 1 month after the beginning
of treatment to assess early biologic effects of sunitinib.
Tumor responses were determined with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0.

Study Design and Treatment

The primary objectives of this study were to determine
the proportion of participants who were alive and without
disease progression at 2 months and to determine the best
overall response rate of participants with metastatic mucosal or acral melanoma treated with sunitinib. Because of
the poor prognosis of this group of patients, it was felt
that being alive and without disease progression at 2
months would allow an early assessment of efficacy.
Secondary objectives included determining the time to
progression and overall survival of participants with metastatic mucosal or acral melanoma treated with sunitinib
and the correlation of the KIT mutational/amplification
status with the response to therapy. The study received a
priori approval by the Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Board.
The initially planned accrual for the study was 32 participants at a dose of 50 mg of oral sunitinib daily for
4 weeks followed by a 2-week break from treatment; this
was to be continued until the progression of disease or toxicity. Because of difficulty with the tolerability of the drug
and evidence of progressive disease after treatment breaks,
the study treatment was amended to 37.5 mg of sunitinib
daily on a continuous basis. Participants being treated with
the intermittent-dosing scheme continued to be treated in
this manner and were considered cohort A. Cohort B was
treated with the continuous dosing regimen and followed a
2-stage design with a planned accrual of 45 participants.

KIT Mutation Status

Pretreatment tumor biopsies were reviewed by a pathologist, and tumor areas were identified. The KIT mutational
status was tested at each institution by a combination of
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and DNA sequencing to
look for mutations with amplicons arising from exons 9,
11, 13, and 17.
For patients whose KIT was tested with PCR and
HPLC, the DNA was extracted and purified from
paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Selected exons of the
KIT gene were amplified by PCR, and the products were
screened by 1 of 2 methods: 1) a combination of real-time
PCR and high-resolution melting curve analysis or 2)
denaturing HPLC (WAVE system; Transgenomic, Inc).
Suspected mutations were confirmed by direct DNA
sequencing.
For some of the patients, the mutational status was
determined with SNaPshot genotyping. This assay uses a
multiplex PCR technology called anchored multiplex PCR
for single-nucleotide variant and insertion/deletion detection in genomic DNA with next-generation sequencing.

Statistical Analysis

The initial study design was a single-stage design powered
to compare a null rate of 5% for participants being alive
and progression-free at 2 months with an alternative rate
of 20% to achieve 90% power and a target type I error of
10%. The amended study for cohort B was a 2-stage
design with a plan to enroll 23 patients in the first stage. If
2 or more were alive with no disease progression at 2
months, accrual would continue to the second stage with
the enrollment of 22 additional participants. If at least 5
patients among the 45 enrolled responded to sunitinib,
the regimen would be considered promising. The design
had 93% power and a type I error of .06. If the true
response rate was 5%, the probability of stopping at the
end of the first stage would be 0.68.
When the study was closed to accrual, exploratory
power calculations were conducted to assess the operating
characteristics of cohort A with 21 patients and cohort B
Cancer

with a total sample size of 31. The null and alternative
hypotheses remained unchanged at 5% and 20%, respectively. For cohort A, the sample size of 21 would provide
82% power with a 1-sided significance level of .1 to detect
the difference between primary endpoint rates of 5% and
20%. For cohort B, a sufficient number of events had already occurred to allow accrual to continue to the second
stage of the original Simon 2-stage design. If there were
4 or more responses among 31 participants, there would
be 88% power with a 6% to 7% type I error to detect a
difference in the primary endpoint rates of 5% and 20%.
RESULTS
Patients and Treatment

A total of 52 patients were enrolled at 5 medical centers
between August 8, 2007 and August 1, 2013. Twenty-one
of these participants were in intermittent-dosing cohort
A, and 31 participants were in continual-dosing cohort B.

progression and (D) overall survival by KIT mutational status for patients treated with sunitinib.

The baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Patients were predominantly female; the majority had an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0 and had
M1c disease. Twenty-five percent of the patients were
positive for a KIT mutation; for 15%, the status was
unknown. Ninety-four percent of the patients underwent
prior cancer-directed surgery, with 29% (15) receiving
chemotherapy after surgery, 17% (9) receiving radiation
therapy after surgery, and 19% (10) receiving all 3 modalities of treatment. None of the characteristics summarized
in Table 1 were statistically different between the cohorts.
An analysis was performed for all 52 enrolled patients.
Patients received a mean of 3 cycles of therapy with a
range of 2 to 11 cycles.
Efficacy

At the time of the analysis, all patients were off the study
drug, with 69% stopping because of progressive disease. A

complete or partial response as the best response to therapy occurred in 4 participants (8%; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 2%-19%); disease control was recorded in
23 participants (44%; 95% CI, 30%-59%). Two of the
patients with partial responses were in the first cohort
(intermittent dosing) with disease progression at 5 and 6
months. The other 2 patients with partial responses were
in the second cohort (continual dosing) with disease progression at 6 and 10 months. Among the patients with
partial responses, 3 had mucosal melanoma, and 1 had
acral melanoma. Forty-three participants (83%) were
confirmed to have died. For the majority of these participants, the cause of death was disease progression.
For all participants combined, 52% (27 of 52) were
alive and progression-free after 2 months of therapy (95%
CI, 38%-66%). At 2 months, 11 of 21 participants (52%;

in cohort B were alive and progression-free at 2 months,

Efficacy by the KIT Mutation Status

Sunitinib is a known inhibitor of KIT. A secondary endpoint in this study was to correlate the KIT mutation status with the response to therapy. KIT mutations were
identified in 13 patients, and the specific mutations that
were detected and their methods of detection are listed in
Table 2. The majority of these mutations were in exon 11,
which is also the most frequently mutated exon in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and predicts the response to
imatinib.18 As for the responses noted, 3 of the partial
responses were in patients without a KIT mutation in
their tumor, and 1 was in a patient with a known mutation. This patient had a mutation in exon 11 c.1676Y>A
(V559D). There were no statistical differences noted
when they were compared by the KIT status, with a
response rate of 7.7% for patients with a mutation and a
rate of 9.7% for patients without one. A breakdown of
responses by the KIT mutational status is shown in
Table 3.
TTP and overall survival curves by the KIT mutational status are shown in Figure 1. The median time to
progression for patients without a KIT mutation was 2.8
months (95% CI, 1.7-5.0 months); for those with a KIT
mutation, it was 3.2 months (95% CI, 1.7-3.7 months);
and for those with an unknown mutational status, it was
1.8 months (95% CI, 0.9-3.7 months). There was no

statistical difference in the time to progression by KIT status (P 5 .35). The median overall survival for patients
without a KIT mutation was 8.6 months (95% CI, 6.611.1 months); for those with a KIT mutation, it was 6.4
months (95% CI, 2.7-8.8 months); and for those with an
unknown mutational status, it was 6.2 months (95% CI,
1.2-13.4 months). There was no statistical difference in
overall survival by KIT status (P 5 .24).

Toxicity

Fifty-one of the 52 patients reported adverse events (AEs)
during the trial. Patients in cohort A reported a greater
number of AEs during the trial; the comparison between
cohorts did not reach statistical significance (median, 14
vs 10 AEs; Wilcoxon rank-sum P 5 .08). However, when
AEs that were deemed to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment (related adverse events
[RAEs]) were analyzed, participants in cohort A had a significantly greater number of different RAE types per
patient than participants in cohort B (median, 10 vs 8
RAEs; Wilcoxon rank-sum P 5 .03).
The most commonly reported AEs were fatigue
(31), leukopenia (25), thrombocytopenia (23), nausea
(21), neutropenia (20), and diarrhea (20). There were 2
on-study deaths reported: one was due to progressive disease, and the other was due to an acute cardiac event felt
to be due to bowel perforation or acute hypoxia possibly
related to treatment. Drug-related clinical AEs are summarized in Table 4.

DISCUSSION
The ability to characterize melanomas on the basis of the
genetic alterations that are driving them provides important therapeutic opportunities. This has been proven for
BRAF-mutated melanomas: BRAF/MEK-targeted therapies have led to an improvement in survival and to drugs
approved for this patient population.19-21 Targeting
genetic alterations has potential for melanoma subtypes
such as mucosal and acral melanomas, which have a very
poor prognosis. Mutation or overexpression of KIT in
these subtypes of melanoma has led to the testing of agents
that target KIT.
Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has activity in KIT-positive gastrointestinal stromal tumors and
has been tested in melanoma. Two phase 2 trials of imatinib in patients with metastatic melanoma who were not
preselected on the basis of a KIT mutation or subtype
showed no efficacy in this population.22,23 However, a
phase 2 trial in patients who expressed KIT, plateletderived growth factor receptor, or c-abl and were treated
with imatinib showed some activity in patients with KIT
aberrations.24 Three subsequent studies of imatinib were
performed in patients with KIT genomic aberrations. The
first 2 had a response rate of 16% and a disease control
rate of 56%, respectively, and a median TTP of 3 months
and progression-free survival of 3.5 months.8,25 A third
trial targeted patients with mutationally active or amplified KIT arising at mucosal, acral, and chronically sundamaged skin sites with a disease control rate of 50%
overall and a median TTP of 3.7 months.6 Interestingly,

the disease control rate was 77% for patients with a KIT
mutation versus 18% for those in whom it was amplified
without a mutation.
Other KIT inhibitors such as dasatinib,26 sorafe27
nib, and nilotinib28 have also demonstrated responses
in KIT-mutant melanomas. A phase 2 trial of dasatinib in
melanoma showed minimal activity but did report a partial response in 1 patient with a KIT mutation.9 In a previous study by Minor et al,29 90 patients with melanoma
were tested for KIT mutations, overexpression, and
amplification. Among the patients who tested positive for
KIT mutation, overexpression, or amplification, 12 were
subsequently treated with sunitinib. Among the 4 patients
with a KIT mutation, 1 had a complete response, which
lasted for 15 months, and 2 had partial responses to therapy, which lasted 1 and 7 months.
Another potential target in the treatment of melanoma is VEGF because its activity is known to play a role
in its pathogenesis and metastasis. Clinical trials targeting
VEGFA with bevacizumab showed prolonged disease stabilization in approximately a quarter of the patients

treated.12,30,31 The combination of bevacizumab and
other agents has proven effective, and when combined
with sorafenib, it led to a stable disease rate of 57% with a
median TTP of 32 weeks.13 Immunotherapy improves
survival for patients with advanced melanoma, and there
are data showing that VEGF has immunologic effects by
suppressing dendritic cell maturation and modulating
lymphocyte trafficking. This has led to the combination
of ipilimumab with VEGF inhibition, with an early phase
trial showing a disease control rate of 66.7% with a median survival of 25.1 months.14
On the basis of the role of KIT and VEGF targeting
in melanoma, we conducted the current phase 2 trial of
sunitinib in unselected patients with mucosal and acral
melanomas. At the time of study initiation, there was
promise for anti-VEGF therapy on its own in melanoma.
Therefore, the current trial was performed in a genomically unselected group of patients. Mucosal and acral melanomas are rare, and the selection of patients whose
tumors harbor KIT mutations would pose challenges for
timely accrual and resource allocation. Because of the
4013

higher rates of KIT mutation in these melanomas, this
would nonetheless be an enriched population.
The current study demonstrates the challenges of
administering a multitarget kinase inhibitor in the metastatic mucosal and acral melanoma patient population.
There was a high rate of toxicity in cohort A with intermediate dosing of sunitinib as well as a suggestion of progressing disease during treatment breaks. Data for renal
cell carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors suggest
that continuous dosing with 37.5 mg daily is equivalent
to intermittent dosing.32 As a result, cohort B was initiated to test continuous dosing of sunitinib. The toxicity of
the study medication in both cohorts was high, with 11%
of the patients leaving the study because of toxicity, and
there was 1 participant death possibly related to the study
medication. However, there was a trend toward fewer
overall AEs and significantly fewer treatment RAEs in the
continuous-dosing arm. The major toxicities corresponded with those that have been seen previously with
sunitinib and included fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea.
The disease control rate in this study was 44%. Only
4 patients were noted to have partial responses: 1 with a
KIT mutation and 3 with wild-type tumors (for representative imaging, see Fig. 2). Unfortunately, the number of
KIT-mutated patients in this study was low, and this limits the interpretation of the responses in these patients.
One patient with a KIT c.1676T>A (V559D) mutation
responded to sunitinib treatment in this trial. The V559D
mutation is seen in approximately 5% of KIT-mutated
malignant melanomas and is a known driver mutation.33
Although the response to KIT inhibition varies on the basis of the KIT mutation, reports have demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with V559A-mutant melanoma
treated with imatinib and sunitinib.34,35
In comparison with the prior trial of sunitinib from
Minor et al,29 the response rate was lower than that previously seen in KIT-mutated patients. The overall response
rate seen in this trial likely reflects the complex diversity of
mechanisms that drive tumor growth in these subtypes of
melanoma. There is genetic variability among different
melanoma subtypes, including those harboring KIT
mutations, and this may lead to resistance to KIT-targeted
or multikinase inhibitors. In addition, there is variability
among KIT inhibitors as demonstrated by the responses
observed in patients treated with nilotinib after progression on prior KIT inhibition.36
The responses in non–KIT-mutated patients suggest
that there are alternate pathways targeted by sunitinib that
are driving the growth of these melanomas. This may be
related to VEGF targeting or other tyrosine kinases inhib4014

ited by sunitinib because of its known multikinase activity. All patients eventually progressed on therapy, and this
indicated some form of acquired resistance after exposure
to sunitinib. Resistance to sunitinib has been best elucidated in patients with renal cell carcinoma, where it has
been found to be related to upregulation of proangiogenic
and other alternate signaling pathways, changes in the tumor microenvironment, and the action of microRNAs.37
On the basis of the study design, 20% or more of the
patients being alive and progression-free at 2 months
would be considered promising and worthy of further
study of sunitinib in mucosal and acral melanomas. With
the combined cohorts, 52% of the patients were alive and
progression-free at 2 months, and this suggested activity
of sunitinib in these melanoma subtypes. However, there
were only 4 responses seen within the 52 patients enrolled,
and only 1 of these was in a patient with a KIT mutation.
There was not a statistically increased response in patients
with a KIT mutation versus those without one.
A better understanding of innate and acquired resistance to KIT inhibitors will assist us in building better
combination therapies and guiding patient selection.
With the rapid increase in our knowledge of melanoma
biology as well as the development of immune38-40 and
targeted therapies19-21 to treat melanoma, the greatest
opportunities to take advantage of the unique mechanisms driving mucosal and acral melanoma remain in
play. Future combinations that take advantage of the multitarget nature of sunitinib may have some promise in the
future.
