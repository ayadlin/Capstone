Abstract:

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises a heterogeneous group of clonal disorders
of hematopoietic progenitors. We previously showed that heme oxygenase-1 (HO1/Hsp32) underlies resistance of AML to TNF-induced apoptosis. Here we show for
the first time that the modulatory protein, FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) indirectly
regulates induction of HO-1 in response to TNF in human AML blasts, but not noncancerous control cells. In AML cells, TNF-induced FLIP expression was an NF-κBdependent event, and silencing of FLIP isoforms (FLIPL, FLIPS and FLIPR) induced
pro-apoptotic responses to TNF, with FLIPL knock-down providing the greatest
apoptotic switch. However, FLIPL knock-down consequently increased expression
of HO-1; a response that occurred in AML (but not non-cancerous) cells to protect
a proportion of them from apoptotic death. Our results show that increases in HO-1
induced an apoptotic-resistant form in AML cells in the absence of FLIPL. This is the
first time that FLIPL has been shown to regulate the expression of HO-1. These data
reveal unique regulatory networks in cancerous AML cells whereby FLIP regulation
of HO-1 provides AML cells with secondary anti-apoptotic protection against extrinsic
factors (eg TNF/chemotherapies) that try to switch on death signals in these highly
death-resistant cells. Future AML therapies should target these mechanisms.

Introduction

Apoptosis is an essential part of mechanisms that
maintain normal cellular homeostasis. Deregulation of
the apoptosis machinery and evasion of apoptosis is a
mechanism of most human malignancies, including AML
[3,4]. Most systemic anti-cancer therapies (SACT) act by
the induction of apoptosis, therefore, evasion of apoptosis
is mainly responsible for the insufficiency of current
therapies. It is well documented that malignant cells can
die of apoptosis primarily through the extrinsic death
receptor-induced pathway [5], the activation of which
involves ligation of a death ligand with trimerization
of death receptors, leading to the formation of the
death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) followed by
the activating cleavage of caspase-8 in the DISC [6].
Apoptosis mediated via DISC is regulated by cellular

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignancy
of the myeloid progenitors, characterized by the rapid
growth of abnormal myeloid cells that accumulate in the
bone marrow and blood. AML is the most common acute
leukemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with
age with 75% of patients diagnosed after the age of 60 [1].
Furthermore, with current intensive therapeutic strategies
generally limited to a minority of younger, fitter patients,
there is a significant unmet need for better tolerated antiAML therapy [2]. Therefore understanding the processes
that protect these complicated cells from undergoing
apoptosis in response to endogenous signals is an essential
step to developing new improved anti-AML therapy.

Fas-associated protein with death domain-like IL-1βconverting enzyme inhibitory protein (FLIP)[7].
FLIP mediated regulation of the DISC is through
the modulation of activation of procaspase-8 and thereby
prevents induction of apoptosis mediated by death receptors
[8]. Inducible control of FLIP expression is thought to be
controlled by the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB
(NF-κB) however we have shown that other transcription
binding sites do exist in the FLIP promoter [9]. The human
FLIP gene, with an estimated size of ~48000 base pairs,
consists of at least 14 exons. It has been described that at
least 11 different isoforms of cellular FLIP are transcribed
at the mRNA level, generating different splice variants

and FLIPR have been shown to have a clear anti-apoptotic
function, the role of FLIPL in regulating apoptosis has
been found to be quite controversial [10,11]. Most reports
describe FLIPL as an anti-apoptotic molecule that blocks
caspase activation, whereas, others suggest that FLIPL
catalyzes caspase-8 processing at the DISC and therefore
has a pro-apoptotic function.
We have previously shown that in the human AML
cell line THP-1, FLIPL is induced in a NF-κB-dependent
response [3]. In the same study we showed that FLIPL had
only a limited role in regulating apoptosis in AML cells
in response to TNF-mediated death responses. Here we
demonstrate a novel pathway involving FLIPL negatively
regulating the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1),
whose role in chemoresistance, both in AML and other
cancers, is well established.

Results

TNF in a time dependent fashion, with all FLIP isoforms
mRNAs being significantly raised from at least 4 h
treatment with TNF. FLIPL has the greatest induction in all
cells tested suggesting that this protein may have the most
influence on apoptotic pathways. Figure 1B confirms that
the induction of FLIPL and FLIPS, but not FLIPR by TNF
is a NF-κB-dependent response. The slight but significant
mRNA induction of FLIPR by TNF is not controlled by
NF-κB. Figure 1C shows the protein induction of these
proteins in THP-1 cells confirming that NF-κB regulates
this response. One interesting observation is that we could
not detect the protein for FLIPR, thus suggesting that
mRNA is not processed into protein or the protein level of
FLIPR is lower than the detectable concentration for this
assay.

FLIP isoform expression in human AML in
response to TNF
Previously we have shown that the FLIP isoform,
FLIPL, is induced in AML cell line THP-1 and HL60, in
response to TNF in a NF-κB-dependent mechanism [3].
Others have shown that cFLIP can protect cells from TNF
induced apoptosis [12]. Moreover the function of the three
recognised FLIP isoforms (FLIPL FLIPS and FLIPR) has
not been wholly established in human AML. Therefore,
we wanted to fully elucidate the induction of FLIP
isoforms (FLIPL FLIPS and FLIPR) in response to TNF
in human AML patient samples, AML cell lines and nonmalignant control cells. Cells were treated with TNF for
various time points Figure 1A shows the mRNA induction
of FLIP isoforms in response to TNF in human AML cells.
This shows that FLIPL, FLIPS and FLIPR are all induced by

used siRNA to target knockdown of these modulators.
Figure 2A shows that we can effectively and specifically
knockdown mRNA levels of FLIPL, FLIPS and FLIPR in
human AML cells. When we knocked down FLIPL, FLIPS
and FLIPR expression in AML cell line THP-1 and human
monocytes (Figure 2B) we showed there to no difference
in apoptotic response between control knockdown and
FLIPL or FLIPS or FLIPR knockdown in THP-1 cells,
however we did see a significant increase in monocyte
apoptosis in FLIPL-targeted cells. When we activated
transfected cells using TNF, we found that cells targeted
with FLIPL knockdown, but not FLIPS and FLIPR, were
susceptible to apoptosis. Nevertheless, in this assay, the
cells treated with FLIPL knockdown in combination with
TNF showed only 44% apoptosis, thus suggesting that
some other mechanism is controlling apoptotic responses
in the remaining 56% of live cells. However, these findings
do suggest that FLIPL but not FLIPS or FLIPR can partially
regulate TNF-induced apoptosis in human AML cells

expression of cytoprotective genes HO-1 in AML303,

AML306 and THP-1, but not control cells. Figure 3B
confirms these findings at the protein level. Taken together
these data suggest that under normal basal conditions in
AML, FLIPL normally regulates the expression of HO-1
in cancerous cells only.

Finally we wanted to determine if silencing FLIPL
and HO-1 in combination could induce further apoptosis
in AML cells in response to TNF. When we knocked down
FLIPL and HO-1 in AML cell line THP-1 (Figure 4) we
showed that TNF induced a significantly greater apoptotic
response in these AML cells when compared to cells
with separate knockdown of either FLIPL or HO-1 alone.
Preventing the function of both FLIPL and HO-1 together,
allows the vast majority (73%) of AML cells to become
sensitive to TNF-induced death, compared to only 6% of
the same cells dying in the absence of TNF. Interestingly,
knockdown of HO-1 alone allowed only 15% of AML
cells to be sensitive towards TNF-induced death. These
findings suggest that together FLIPL and HO-1 protect
AML cells from TNF-induced apoptosis and both need to
be targeted for effective AML therapy.

Discussion
Understanding host responses that modulate
apoptosis in human AML is key to developing new
therapeutic strategies to reduce the mortality associated
with this complex disease. The present study demonstrates
that FLIPL can regulate the expression of HO-1, and that

targeting knockdown of both molecules using siRNA
improves apoptosis in response to TNF treatment.
Most research to date regarding the importance of FLIP
in regulating cell survival has focused on its role in
preventing the formation of the DISC. This is the first time
FLIP has been shown to regulate HO-1 gene induction in
human cells, moreover, targeting both HO-1 and FLIP in
combination could markedly improve survival rates in
human AML.
The regulation of apoptosis in human AML is the
focus of our research. We have previously shown that
inhibiting HO-1 and NF-κB in combination allows AML
cells to undergo apoptosis, thus suggesting that both these
pathways are needed for the survival of these malignant
cells [13]. HO-1 protects AML cells from apoptosis
through its antioxidant metabolites bilirubin and carbon
monoxide, which sequester free radicals associated with
modern chemotherapies [15]. FLIPL which is induced in
AML in response to TNF in a NF-κB-dependent manner,
is able to inhibit apoptosis by modulating activation of
procaspase-8 and thereby inhibiting formation of the
DISC [5]. We found in this study that by removing the
induction of FLIPL but not FLIPS or FLIPR, induced the
expression of the cytoprotective protein HO-1.
Expression of HO-1 is usually increased in human
cancer cells, however we have recently shown that in
human AML cells HO-1 expression is significantly lower
when compared with nonmalignant control cells [13].
Further analysis found that the NF-κB subunits p50 and
p65 negatively regulated the expression of this HO-1
mRNA by binding to a putative κB-binding site located
in the HO-1 gene upstream of the antioxidant response
element (ARE) which subsequently binds the transcription
factor, Nrf2. Interestingly, FLIP has been shown to
regulate NF-κB responses in human cells [14]. Thus, one
explanation for the difference of HO-1 levels in cells with
FLIPL-targeted knockdown compared to control cells, is
Number Age Gender

that removing FLIPL reduces the active NF-κB levels in
human AML cells, thus removing its negative influence
on the HO-1 promoter. This would allow HO-1 levels to
come back to normal non-malignant control levels that are
observed in ordinary hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).
We have previously shown that AML cells protect
themselves from TNF-induced apoptotic responses by
two interconnected mechanisms. The first is the induction
of NF-κB-driven anti-apoptotic gene FLIPL. However
when we remove NF-κB activation using BAY-11-7082,
a secondary antiapoptotic pathway regulated by the
transcription factor Nrf2, becomes apparent and drives the
induction of cytoprotective gene HO-1. In this study we
show that we do get some TNF-induced apoptosis of AML
cells when we knockdown FLIPL using siRNA, however
when we combine the treatment to targeting HO-1 as well,
we get a markedly increased level of apoptosis in response
to TNF. This suggests that both FLIPL and HO-1 are two
genes that when individually targeted have little or no
effect on apoptosis of AML cells, but targeting these two
genes in combination would provide a novel mechanism
that future more successful therapies must employ to
effectively treat AML.
Our results clearly indicate that FLIPL and HO-1
together have a role in controlling TNF-induced apoptotic
responses in AML cells. It is also clear that knockdown
of FLIPL induces HO-1 expression in human AML, but
not corresponding non-malignant control cells The role of
the other FLIP isoforms, FLIPS and FLIPR, is clearly less
critical in AML cells in response to TNF. Moreover, the
fact that we were unable to detect FLIPR protein makes
it even less of a target molecule for future anti-AML
therapy. Previously we have shown that HO-1 may play
an important secondary role in protecting AML cells from
apoptotic responses, here we cement the concept that
HO-1 is indeed very important for the survival of AML
cells and therefore should be targeted with new SACT.

consent was obtained from patients and any identifying
information was anonymised according to the approved
ethics code of practice.

SDS-PAGE and Western analyses were performed
as described previously [12]. Briefly, whole cell lysates
were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer method. Western blot protein detection was
by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Flow cytometry
for measuring apoptosis was performed on an Accuri C6
flow cytometer (Acurri).

References

For primary cell isolation, heparinized blood was
collected from volunteers and human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated by Histopaque
(Sigma-Aldrich) density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs
(4 x 106/mL) were incubated in complete medium for
2 h at 37°C to allow adherence of monocytes. Positive
selection of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were
isolated from PBMCs using a CD34 positive selection
kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). For all CD34+ and
primary monocyte experiments at least three different
donors were used to obtain the results presented in this
paper. AML samples that were less than 80% blasts and
expressed CD34, were purified using the CD34 positive
selection kit. Cell type was confirmed by microscopy and
flow cytometry.
