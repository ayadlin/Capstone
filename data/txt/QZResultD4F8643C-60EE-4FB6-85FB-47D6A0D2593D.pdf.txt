ABSTRACT
Chronic unpredicted mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression could alter the
pharmacokinetics of many drugs in rats, however, the underlying mechanism is not
clear. In this work we studied the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide, and explored
the role of glucocorticoid and adrenergic signaling pathway in regulating drug
metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) in GK rats and BRL 3A cells. The plasma cortisol and
epinephrine levels were increased, meanwhile the pharmacokinetics of repaglinide
were altered significantly in depression model rats. Forty-nine genes in liver of model
rats displayed significant difference comparing to control rats. The differentially
expressed genes enriched in the drug metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis
pathway significantly, and Nr1i3 matched 335 connectivity genes. CAR and Ugt1a1
protein expression were enhanced significantly in liver of model rats. The mRNA
expression of Ugt1a1 and Nr1i2 were increased 2 and 4 times respectively with
dexamethasone (DEX) and 8-Br-cAMP co-treatment in BRL 3A cells. The protein
expression of PXR was up-regulated, too. However, RU486 reversed the up-regulated
effect. The adrenergic receptor agonists had little impact on the DMEs in BRL 3A. Our
data suggested that CUMS-induced depression might up-regulate DMEs expression
via glucocorticoid signaling pathway, and accelerate the fate of the repaglinide in
spontaneous diabetes rats.

INTRODUCTION

deprivation stress may modify the expression of many
cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) genes , thus affecting the
efficacy and toxicity of relevant drugs [10]. The impact
of stress on drug metabolism is stress-specific, isozymespecific, gender-specific, and species-specific [11].
Currently more documents demonstrated that
comorbidity with depression in diabetes might influence
hypoglycemic agent efficacy in diabetic patients [12].
Repaglinide, a new prandial glucose regulator, is
metabolized dominantly by CYP2C8 and partially
by CYP3A4 in human beings [13]. If CYP2C8 is
inhibited due to various reasons, it will be replaced
by CYP3A4 [14]. CYP3A4 is regulated by many
transcription factors, among which the pregnane X

Stress is a constant factor in modern life and has
become one of the most important problems affecting
human health in our society [1–4]. Long-term stress
may disturb the homeostasis, and lead to psychological
diseases such as major depressive disorder [5–7]. The
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis with the endpoint release of corticosterone into the circulation plays
a role in mediating the neuroendocrine response to stress
[8]. Once given with depressive stress, concentrations
of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) are usually
elevated, and then declined with the administration of
antidepressants [9]. Evidence showed that maternal

receptor /steroid and xenobiotic receptor (PXR/SXR,
Nr1i2) have been identified as the most critical. The
genetic polymorphism of PXR had impact on the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repaglinide
in healthy Chinese volunteers, and showed that subjects
with genotype of −298G/G and 11193C/C in PXR have
a decreased elimination rate of CYP3A4/2C8 [15].
Our previous work found that chronic unpredicted
mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression could alter
the pharmacokinetics of many drugs in rats [16–19].
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying
the stress and drug metabolism change are not fully
understood. We herein explored the pharmacokinetics
of repaglinide in depression model rats first, and then
focused on the role of glucocorticoid and adrenergic
signaling pathway in regulating drug-metabolizing
enzymes (DMEs) expression in model rats.

To show mRNA expression proﬁle in CUMSinduced depression GK rats, we used a stringency cutoff to
identify signiﬁcantly differently mRNAs (P < 0.05, Fold
Change ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 0.5) and two-dimensional hierarchical
clustering 3.0 to represent expression profiles between
samples. The GeneChip results illustrated that a greater
number of differentially expressed probes were observed
between the two groups, which matched 49 differentially
expressed genes (DEGs). Among them, 13 DEGs were
down-regulated, and 36 were up-regulated in depression
rats (Figure 3A). The hierarchical clustering of DEGs
was visualized as a heatmap (Figure 4). Based on the
GeneSpring software analysis the up-regulated DEGs were
interconnected and formed gene expression networks.
Nr1i3 matched 335 connectivity, which regulated the
Ugt1a1, Ugt2b1, Cyp3a18 and others genes expression
and function (Figure 5 and Table 2).
To determine which pathway might be involved in
CUMS-induced depression, KEGG pathway analysis was
used to authenticate pathways and understand biological
functions of significantly differentially expressed genes.
The result indicated that the up-regulated DEGs were
enriched in 10 pathways, including the drug metabolism,
steroid hormone biosynthesis, and so on (Figure 3C
and Table 3). Steroid hormone biosynthesis (rno00140,
FDR  =  0.007) and Drug metabolism (rno00982,
FDR  =  0.058) were significantly enriched pathways.
Five genes, namely Cyp3a18, Ugt1a1, Ugt2b1,Cyp2b1/2
and Gsta5, were included in drug-metabolism pathway.
Additionally, Cyp17a1 instead of Gsta5, and other four genes,
were also enriched in steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway.
These DEGs relevant to drug-metabolism and
steroid hormone biosynthesis in the liver tissue of GK rats
were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR). The result showed that Cyp17a1,
Cyp3a18, Cyp2b1/2, Ugt1a1, Ugt2b1, Gsta5, and Nr1i3
were increased approximately 2–4 folds in liver tissue of
model rats compared with control rats (Figure 3B). The
relative foldchanges detected by qRT-PCR were consistent
with the microarray results, indicating the dependability of
our microarray platform.

RESULTS
Establishment of CUMS-induced depression in
GK rats
As shown in Figure 1, no significant differences
were found between the two groups prior to model
establishment. However, after 8 weeks’ stress, the rats
in the CUMS depression group displayed depressivelike behaviors. Open-field test showed that the vertical
and horizontal scores in the CUMS depression group
significantly decreased from 50.83 ± 8.04 to 32.08 ± 8.36
(p < 0.01) and 121.75 ± 8.82 to 79.08 ± 10.55 (p < 0.01),
respectively. The sucrose preference values in the
CUMS depression group significantly decreased from
71.63 ± 11.08 to 55.53 ± 9.55 (p < 0.01). At the same
time the plasma cortisol (CORT) and epinephrine
(NE) concentration in CUMS depression group were
significantly increased about 30% (240.83 ± 87.49 to
322.67 ± 84.11, p < 0.05) and 45% (411.14 ± 61.31 to
609.75 ± 71.21, p < 0.05), respectively. No change was
existed within control group. These results confirmed
CUMS-induced depression rat model was established
successfully.

DISCUSSION

stress hormone cortisol level increased significantly and
repaglinide pharmacokinetics changed in model rats.
Leblond et al. found that stress hormone might regulate
the expression of CYP2C11, CYP 3A1/2 in rats with
chronic renal failure [20]. Therefore we surmised that
pharmacokinetic change in depression model rats might
be consequence of DMEs expression alters associated with
hormone stress.

Various physiological and pathological factors
such as age, sex, and individual genetic background can
affect drug metabolism. Recently evidences showed that
psychological factors also influence the drug metabolism
process [16–19]. We herein established the CUMS
induced-depression model with GK rats. We noted that

In order to explore the underlying mechanism, we
compared the gene expression profiles of liver tissue of
depression model rats to that of control rats. The results
indicated that mRNA expression of Cyp17a1, Cyp3a18,
Cyp2b1/2, Gsta5, Ugt1a1 and Ugt2b1 were up-regulated
significantly in model group rats. These differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) that met the thresholds yielded
and enriched in KEGG pathways of drug metabolismenzymes and steroid hormone biosynthesis. Nr1i3 was
the central node of up-regulated DEGs Using GeneSpring
software analysis, which influenced the most of other
genes expression. The mRNA expression of Cyp17a1,
Cyp3a18, Cyp2b1/2, Gsta5, Ugt1a1, Ugt2b1 and Nr1i3 in
gene chip was confirmed by qRT-PCR. At same time the
protein expression of Cyp3a1, Cyp2b1/2, and Ugt2b were

increased slightly in model rats compared with control
rats, but Ugt1a1 and CAR were up-regulated significantly.
The biosynthesis of cortisol is dependent on the
activity of microsomal CYP17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase
[21] meanwhile steroid hormone enhances the CYP450
expression under stress [22]. In this study Cyp17a1
mRNA expression was up-regulated significantly in liver
tissue of model rats, and cortisol was in increased in model
rats, demonstrated the delicate interaction among drugmetabolism enzymes expression, stress hormone and stress
in model rats. UDP-glucuronosyl transferases (UGTs) are
major phase II enzyme family in the liver micro some [23].
Among them Ugt1a1 detoxifies bilirubin neurotoxicity by
conjugating with glucuronic acid, therefore plays a critical
role in the detoxification and excretion of endogenous and

exogenous lipophilic compounds [24]. Species and tissue/
cell-dependent regulation of UGT expression by ligandactivated transcription factors is often involved in the
regulation of homeostasis [25]. Ugt1a1 expression was
up-regulated significantly in this study, suggested that
Ugt1a1 participate in substrates metabolism to cope with
stress. The transcription factor Nr1i3, encoding orphan
nuclear receptor CAR, regulates gene encoding DMEs and
transporters in livers of rats [26]. Both mRNA expression
of Nr1i3 and protein expression of CAR were consistently
up-regulated in depression model rats in this study. Besides
GeneSpring analysis results indicated Nr1i3 regulates
Ugt1a1 and other DMEs expression.
In liver tissue of model rats KEGG pathway analysis
highlighted significant enrichment in drug metabolismenzymes and steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway. To
further study the role of steroid hormone in regulating
the differential expression of DMEs induced by stress,
rat liver cell line of BRL 3A was treated with DEX. We
noted that it was Nr1i2 (rather than Nr1i3) that increased
twice as treated with DEX for 48 hr, while glucocorticoid
receptor antagonist RU486 reversed this stimulatory
effect. When BRL 3A cells were co-treated with DEX
and 8-Br-cAMP(analog of cAMP) for 48 hr, both Ugt1a1
and Nr1i2 were up-regulated significantly (Nr1i2 was
up-regulated almost 4 folds), along with Nrli2 encoding
PXR was up-regulated. Since both glucocorticoids
and cAMP stimulates corticotropin releasing hormone
(CRH) promoter through the cAMP response element
(CRE) [21], the synergistic stimulatory effect of DEX
and 8-Br-cAMP on Ugt1a1 and Nr1i2 might be mediated
through the CRE. Over the past two decades, differential
expression of DMEs induced by stress rose as an
important pharmacology hot issue. Coordinated regulation
of DMEs and transporters are mediated by a number of
transcription factors [27] including CAR and PXR [28].
The transcriptional pathways that are activated in response
to stress via CAR and PXR may be better explained the
Ugt1a1 expression in this study.
Although epinephrine plasma level increased
significantly in depression model rats, it seems that
epinephrine has little-to-no effect on DMEs expression
in vitro experiment. As BRL3A cells were treated with
the selective adrenergic agonists DEXT and PE for 48 hr,
Cyp3a18 expression was only moderately up-regulated
without any significant difference. Similarly Cyp2b1/2,
Ugt1a1, Gsta5, Nr1i2 and Nr1i3 expression also changed
a little. The protein expression of Ugt1a1, Cyp3a1 and
PXR were broadly unchanged, too. Besides, β-adrenergic
agonist ISO had no effect on the drug metabolism-related
gene/protein expression. The mechanism of the little-tono effect of adrenergic receptor agonist in vitro assay is
not clear. Adrenergic receptors are expressed in the central
nervous system and peripheral nervous system involving in
the regulation of various physiological functions [29, 30].
Glucocorticoids are the major regulators of CYP450,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and their release are affected by the adrenergic signaling
pathway [31]. Stress might directly promote the expression
of CYP3A, CYP2C and CYP2D via the adrenergic
pathway, or indirectly regulate the expression of CYP450
through insulin pathway [32]. The in vitro little-to-no effect
of adrenergic receptor agonists in BRL 3A cells suggested
that adrenergic pathway might be dominantly related with
the release of glucocorticoids in vivo.
Our data suggested that CUMS-induced depression
might up-regulate DMEs expression via glucocorticoid
signaling pathway, and accelerate the fate of the repaglinide
in spontaneous diabetes rats. Nuclear transcription factor
Nr1i3 and Nr1i2 were specific in regulating DMEs genes
under stress via glucocorticoid hormone.

Establishment of CUMS-induced depression model
Five weeks old male GK rats were purchased from
Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Animal
Quality Certificate: 2007000562918), were kept in
44361

Oncotarget

the Laboratory of Animal Center, East China Normal
University, Shanghai (Animal Experiment License: SYXK
2010–0094). Rats were kept in the cage for 7 weeks in
an SPF-grade lab until the emergence of diabetes (with
blood glucose level ≥ 11 mmol/L). Then the diabetic rats
were randomly divided into two groups: control group
and depression model group (n = 10 per group). The
depression model group rat was fed alone in a cage for 8
weeks with food and water ad libitum. Each rat was given
one kind of stresses daily. The stresses included activity
restriction (in bottle, 1 hr), hot water swimming (45oC, 5
min), cold water swimming (4oC, 5 min), clip tail (1 min),
cages tilting (45oC, 24 hr), cage horizontal shaking (10
min), damp padding (24 hr), noise interference (10 min),
and day/night inversion (24 hr). Each stress was used
5–6 times randomly but not consecutively to avoid rat’s
prediction. The control group rats were normally fed for
8 weeks with food and water ad libitum without any stress.
The open-field test was performed in a quiet room
using a ZS-ZFT Video Analysis system before and after
model establishment (ZSDC Sci-Tech Co, China). Each rat
was individually placed in an opaque box (100 cm ×100
cm × 40 cm) and the bottom was divided into 25 × 25 cm2
equal-size squares. Rearing times and four claws climbing
square numbers were considered as an index of vertical
and horizontal scores, respectively. The behavior of each
rat was video-recorded for 5 min [17].
Sucrose preference test was also carried out before
and after model establishment. Firstly, rats were trained
to adapt to 1% sucrose solution for 24 hr. Then, two
bottles, one containing 1% sucrose solution and other
containing tap water, were placed to each rat for 24 hr.
After the adaptation, rats were deprived of water and
food for 24 hr. The rats then were free to access to two
bottles containing 1% sucrose solution and tap water.
After 1hr, sucrose solution and tap water consumptions
were measured, and the sucrose preference was
calculated by the equation as follow: sucrose preference
= sucrose consumption/ (sucrose consumption + water
consumption) ×100% [33].
Before and after the model establishment, blood
samples were collected from rats’ eye canthus and
centrifuged to obtain plasma at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The
plasma cortisol (CORT) and epinephrine (NE) levels were
assayed with ELISA Kit according to the instructions.

The plasma concentration of repaglinide was
determined by LC-MS/MS based on reference with a
minor modification [34]. A volume of 100 μL nateglinide,
as an internal standard, and 300 μL methanol were mixed
with 100 μL plasma sample. Then mixture solution was
vortex-mixed for 1min, followed by centrifugation at
15,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was directly
injected for LC-MS/MS analysis. The LC-MS/MS system
consisted of Agilent 1260 HPLC (Agilent, USA) couple
to an Agilent 6420 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer
(Agilent, USA). The separation was performed on a
ZORBAX EP- C18 column (50 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm,
Agilent) at 35oC with methanol - 0.1% formic acid
aqueous solution (80:20) as a mobile phase at a flow rate
of 1.0 ml/min. The mass spectrometer was run in operated
positive electrospray ionization (ESI) mode, with the
electrospray voltage, gas pressure and temperature set to
4,000 V, 15 psi and 350oC, respectively, which was set to
monitor the m/z 453.2 → m/z 230.1 for repaglinide and
m/z 316.0 → m/z 168.1 for nateglinide, respectively. The
HPLC system and mass spectrometer were controlled
by Masshunter Workstation software (version B.06.00,
Agilent, USA), and data were collected with the same
software. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated
by PKSolver 2.0, which is an add-in program for
pharmacokinetic data analysis in Microsoft Excel [35].

Gene expression profiling and bioinformatics
analysis
GK rats were sacrificed after the pharmacokinetic
experiment was finished. Rats’ livers were collected,
washed with 0.9% NaCl solution, and stored at –80oC
until use. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent
following the instructions. RIN number was used to
inspect RNA integrity by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100
(Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US). Qualified
total RNA was further purified by RNeasy micro kit
and RNase-Free DNase Set. Total RNA were amplified,
labelled and purified by using Gene Chip 3′IVT Express
Kit followed the manufacturer’s instructions to obtain
biotin labelled cRNA.
Array hybridization and wash was performed
using GeneChip® Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit
in Hybridization Oven 645 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA, USA) and Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) followed the instructions. Slides were
scanned by GeneChip® Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) and Command Console Software 3.1
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with default settings.
Microarray quality control assessment and data acquisition
were performed with the GeneChip® Operating Software
(GCOS, Affymetrix). Raw data which could be available
from the databases (GSE94988) were normalized by
MAS 5.0 algorithm, and the differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) were further analyzed. The intention DEGs

Determination of plasma repaglinide
concentration
After depression model establishment, the
repaglinide suspension was given by gavage at 6.0 mg/kg
to all rats. Blood samples were collected into heparinized
tubes at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 hr after
administration, and then were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for
5 min at 4oC. The plasma samples were stored at –80oC for
LC-MS/MS analysis.

After subconfluence, the cells were seeded into either
96-well or 6-well plates at the indicated density. The
culture media were replaced every 2 days.
The viability of the BRL 3A cells was quantified by
using Cell Counting Kit (CCK) assay. Cells were seeded
into 96-well plates and dose-response experiments started
24 hr later. BRL 3A cells were treated either with DEX,
or the adrenergic receptor agonists of DEXT, PE, ISO
alone, at different doses ranging from 0.625–10 μmol/L
and DEX in combination with the glucocorticoid
receptors antagonist of the Mifepristone (RU486) or
8-Br-cAMP (cAMP analogue) for 48 hr. Then 10 uL
CCK was added to each well and incubated at 37oC for
2 hr. At last, optical densities (ODs) were measured by
the spectrometric absorbance at 450nm on a microplate
reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). Results were
plotted as percent of survival and concentration-response
curves were fitted in order to determine no inhibition of
cell growth value. Nontoxic drug concentration for each
drug was determined. Cells were seeded into 6-wells
plates and treated with DEX or the adrenergic receptor
agonists alone, or DEX co-treated with 8-Br-cAMP, RU486 for 48hr. Cells were collected for mRNA and proteins
expression measurement as the liver tissue.

Confirmation of mRNA expression by qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TaKaRa MiniBEST
Universal RNA Extraction Kit according to the
instructions. The RNA concentration was determined
using NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific,
USA) at an absorbance of 260 nm. For quantitative RTPCR analysis, total RNA was transcribed to cDNA using
PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser. Real-time
PCR was performed with ABI7500 Real-time PCR system
using SYBR green quantitative PCR master mix. To
normalize the mRNA expression, the housekeeping gene
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
was used as an external standard. The primer sequences
were shown in Table 4. The relative amount of each
mRNA was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt formula [36].

sample (40 μg) was loaded on 10% Bis-Tris Gel which was
then transferred to NC membranes for 60 min at 2.5 mA/
cm2 at room temperature using a Semi-Dry blotting system
(Millipore Co., Chicago, IL). Membranes were blocked
with 5% none fat milk in TBS/0.05% tween (TBST) for
2 hr at room temperature, washed 3 times for 10 min in
TBST, and then incubated with the primary antibodies
against CAR(1:500), PXR(1:1000), Cyp3a1(1:1000),
Cyp2b1/2(1:1000), Ugt1a1(1:1000), Ugt2b(1:1000),
GAPDH and β-actin (1:1000) diluted in TBST respectively
over night at 4°C. Anti-rabbit (diluted 1:5000 in TBST)
horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies
were applied after washing the blots 3 times in TBST for
10 minutes. Chemiluminescence signal was developed
using an ECL kit according to the instructions, and the
band signal was detected by the FluorChem FC3 System.
Band densitometry was quantified using Quantity One
Analysis software (version 4.5.2, Bio-Rad Laboratories,
CA, USA) and signaling was expressed as relative values
as normalized by GAPDH or β-actin bands.
