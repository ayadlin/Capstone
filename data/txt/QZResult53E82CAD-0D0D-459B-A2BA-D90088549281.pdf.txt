Abstract
We have designed a targeted systemic suicide gene therapy
that combines the advantages of tumor-selective gene
expression, using the human telomerase promoter (hTERT),
with the beneficial effects of an oncolytic adenovirus to deliver
the gene for the prodrug-activating enzyme carboxypeptidase
G2 (CPG2) to tumors. Following delivery of the vector
(AdV.hTERT-CPG2) and expression of CPG2 in cancer cells,
the prodrug ZD2767P was administered for conversion by
CPG2 to a cytotoxic drug. This system is sometimes termed
gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT). Here, we
have shown that it is applicable to 10 human colorectal carcinoma cell lines with a direct correlation between viral toxicity
and CPG2 production. SW620 xenografts were selected for
analysis and were significantly reduced or eradicated after a
single administration of AdV.hTERT-CPG2 followed by a
prodrug course. The oncolytic effect of adenovirus alone did
not result in DNA cross-links or apoptosis, whereas DNA crosslinks and apoptosis occurred following prodrug administration, showing the combined beneficial effects of the GDEPT
system. The apoptotic regions extended beyond the areas of
CPG2 expression in the tumors, indicative of significant
bystander effects in vivo. Higher concentrations of vector
particles and CPG2 were found in the AdV.hTERT-CPG2 plus
prodrug–treated tumors compared with the virus alone,
showing an unexpected beneficial and cooperative effect
between the vector and GDEPT. This is the first time that a
tumor-selective GDEPT vector has been shown to be effective
in colorectal carcinoma and that apoptosis and significant
bystander effects have been identified as the mechanisms of
cytotoxicity within the tumor. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4949–55]

Introduction
Despite recent advances in the treatment of colorectal cancer,
the death rate remains high. In 2002, more than 56,000 people died
from the disease in the U.S.4 Agents with novel mechanisms of
actions are needed both in second- and third-line metastatic
disease when other options have been exhausted, along with
improvements in the treatment for earlier clinical settings.
Oncolytic adenovirus therapy has emerged as a promising
candidate (1, 2). It has been shown to produce clinical benefits

in patients with colon cancer (3) and has recently been approved
for cancer treatment in China (4). Oncolytic adenoviruses are
particularly efficient in combination with chemotherapy (5–7).
They are also efficient gene delivery vectors (8) and can be
administered to patients via the hepatic artery (3, 6), which makes
oncolytic adenoviruses attractive for systemic gene therapy of
metastasized colorectal cancer.
We have constructed the oncolytic adenovirus AdV.hTERT-CPG2
for gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy (GDEPT; refs. 8, 9).
GDEPT is a suicide gene therapy approach that directs chemotherapeutic agents to tumors selectively (10). AdV.hTERT-CPG2
replicates in, and kills, telomerase-positive tumor cells, and at the
same time targets expression of the GDEPT enzyme carboxypeptidase G2 (CPG2) to the cancer cells (8) for conversion of the
alkylating agent mustard prodrug ZD2767P (11, 12) to a cytotoxic
drug. It is unlikely that all cells of a tumor (particularly non–cancer
stromal cells) will synthesize CPG2 following the administration
of AdV.hTERT-CPG2. Therefore, a so-called ‘‘bystander effect’’ is
required, i.e., the ability of CPG2-expressing, prodrug-activating
cells to kill adjacent, nonexpressing cells (13).
Here, we describe the use of an oncolytic adenoviral vector that
can target tumors systemically and selectively for activation of a
potent prodrug. We show significant long-term antitumor efficacy
following a single systemic administration of AdV.hTERT-CPG2
followed by a course of prodrug delivery in a xenograft model of
human colorectal cancer. We identify the mechanisms for this
efficacy and show that the oncolytic effect of the virus alone is
enhanced significantly by the effects of the activated prodrug
ZD2767P, resulting in DNA cross-linking, apoptosis, and bystander
killing. Thus, combining the replicating virus with our GDEPT
system has significant advantages over the oncolytic vector or
GDEPT alone.

Materials and Methods
Cells and adenoviruses. The replicating adenoviruses AdV.hTERTCPG2 and AdV.hTERT have been previously described (8). Cell lines were
maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell survival was
determined using MTS assays (CellTiter96 Aqueous Nonradioactive Cell
Proliferation Assay, Promega). Synthesis of ZD2767P (11), CPG2 assays (10),
GDEPT, and bystander experiments (8) were done as described previously.
Floating and adherent cells were pooled and analyzed by flow cytometry
(14) for cell cycle studies or Annexin V FITC binding (Annexin V FITC
Apoptosis Detection Kit, Calbiochem).
Western immunoblotting. We used anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP; BD Biosciences PharMingen), anti-cyclin A (Ab-6, clone 6E6;
Labvision Corporation), anti-cyclin E (M20), anti-cyclin D1 (M20, sc-718),
anti-cyclin B1 (GNS1, sc-245), or anti-ERK2 antibodies (C14, all from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology).

Comet assays. Assays were done in duplicate. Four hours after
treatment, half of the cells were incubated in 100 Amol/L of H2O2 (Sigma)
to induce DNA fragmentation. Olive tail moments (ref. 15; 100 for each
sample) were analyzed using the CometAssay kit (Trevigen, AMS
Biotechnology) and CometScore software.5
Animals. SW620 xenografts were established in female mice (Crl:CD1Fox nu/nu, 7  106 cells s.c., eight animals per group; Charles River). After
6 days, PBS or adenovirus was administered into the tail vein (1011 vp/kg),
following allocation to treatment groups by stratified distribution on tumor
size. ZD2767P (300 mg/kg) was administered as described (16) 5 days after
adenovirus therapy. Additional courses of prodrug (six doses in total) were
injected at weekly intervals. Tumor volumes were calculated relative to the
mean of the first measurement and plotted while at least five animals
survived. Animals were culled when tumors reached 1.7 cm in any
dimension or a mean of 1.5 cm in two perpendicular dimensions. P values
were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 4.02 for Windows (GraphPad
Software). CPG2 assays were as described (17).
Immunofluorescence. Xenografts were frozen in isopentane 5 days after
the second prodrug dose (1011 vp/kg). Cryosections (5 Amol/L) were
exposed to rabbit polyclonal antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (Cell
Signaling) and rat monoclonal anti-CPG2 antibody (ICR hybridoma unit),
followed by Alexa-Fluor 488–conjugated anti-rabbit and Alexa-Fluor
555–conjugated anti-rat secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Nuclei were counterstained with TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen). Samples were imaged on a Leica confocal microscope at
20 magnification using the same intensity parameters.
Real-time PCR. Adenoviral copy numbers were determined as described
(8). For coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) detection, cDNA was
synthesized from total RNA (Trizol, Invitrogen) using random nonamers
(Sigma). Samples were analyzed in triplicate using the 7900 HT Fast Realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems) and the Quantitect Probe PCR kit

Results and Discussion
The telomerase reverse transcriptase gene is active in a wide
range of human cancers, including colorectal carcinoma (18).
Therefore, we hypothesized that the oncolytic vector AdV.hTERTCPG2 would target colorectal carcinoma cells. The viral cytotoxicity was measured by determining the EC50 value for each cell line
(Table 1). In order to assess the suitability of the virus as a GDEPT
gene delivery vector, we also measured the CPG2 enzyme activity in
the cells following infection. The adenovirus was potent in all cell
lines (EC50 values, 0.02–511 pfu/cell; CPG2 levels, 0.3–4.2 units/mg).
There was a significant inverse correlation between EC50 values
and CPG2 levels [log EC50 = 0.77  (CPG2); P = 0.024] (Table 1).
These data show that AdV.hTERT-CPG2 is an effective oncolytic
vector for delivering CPG2 to colon cancer.
We selected a colon cancer cell line, SW620, which grows
reproducibly as xenografts, for further study to determine the
mechanism of cell death of our therapy. Cell cycle analyses showed
that the adenovirus arrested SW620 cells in the S-G2-M phase
(Fig. 1A). Infection with AdV.hTERT-CPG2 altered the expression of

the cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and cyclin E, but not that of
cyclin A or B1 (Fig. 1B), providing further evidence that adenoviruses trap the infected cells in S-G2-M phase, as reported by Bernt
et al. (19). Next, we examined the survival of SW620 cells after
GDEPT treatment. In combination with the prodrug ZD2767P,
AdV.hTERT-CPG2 sensitized SW620 cells 160-fold to the prodrug,
showing the antitumor cell activity of our therapy (Fig. 1C).
For systemic cancer gene therapy in vivo, tumor-selective gene
expression is crucial. Therefore, we tested adenoviral targeting
in nude mice bearing SW620 xenografts. We examined CAR and
found that it is expressed in a range of mouse tissues (Fig. 2A).
We also found that livers, guts, and lungs have higher CAR expression levels than tumors (Fig. 2A). Murine CAR is known to function
as a receptor for human adenoviruses (20). However, when we
administered AdV.hTERT-CPG2 via a single tail vein injection and
measured the CPG2 activity in the tissues, we showed that the
adenovirus selectively targeted CPG2 to the tumors (20.6 units/g;
Fig. 2B), despite the ubiquitous presence of the CAR receptor
(Fig. 2A). We detected little or no CPG2 activity (<0.07 units/g) in
the brains, bone marrow, kidneys, spleens, ovaries, guts, or lungs
from the animals. The two nontumoral tissues with the highest
CPG2 activity levels were muscle (0.2 units/g, 102-fold less than
tumors) and livers (0.7 units/g, 29-fold less than tumors). These
results indicate selective targeting of AdV.hTERT-CPG2 for colon
carcinoma cells in our in vivo model.
To test the efficacy of the GDEPT therapy in vivo, we
administered the AdV.hTERT-CPG2 adenovirus systemically, followed by the prodrug ZD2767P, to nude mice bearing SW620
xenografts. In order to select the lowest optimum dose of
AdV.hTERT-CPG2 for these experiments, we initially assessed
three different viral dosages (1011, 3.3  1011, and 6.7  1011 vp/kg).
We examined the concentration of CPG2 expressed in the tumors,
livers, and plasmas at 4, 8, and 14 days after virus administration
(Table 2). Based on these results, we selected a dose of 1011 vp/kg,
which gave excellent tumor/liver and tumor/plasma ratios (803:1
and 398:1, respectively, 8 days after virus administration). Neither
AdV.hTERT-CPG2 nor the prodrug alone affected the growth of the
xenografts, whereas this GDEPT in combination induced a significant tumor growth delay (Fig. 2C). The average body weight

losses (% of initial weight F SE) while at least five animals
remained were not more than 6.2 F 3.3 for GDEPT, 3 F 2.1 for the
adenovirus, and 5.1 F 2.1 for the prodrug alone, compared with
4.7 F 1.1 in the control group, indicating that the treated groups
had limited or no toxicity compared with the controls. The median
survival of the controls or the animals that received only the
adenovirus was 52 days (Fig. 2D). ZD2767P without AdV.hTERTCPG2 did not increase median survival (Fig. 2D). In contrast,
GDEPT more than doubled the control survival to 111 days
(Fig. 2D). This showed that in combination with ZD2767P,
AdV.hTERT-CPG2 is effective even when virus-mediated tumor
cell killing is low (Fig. 2C and D). Our data show that arming
an oncolytic adenovirus with CPG2 improves its efficacy, thus
allowing the use of lower viral doses and improving the safety of
adenoviruses.
A consideration when engineering an oncolytic adenovirus for
GDEPT is that the activated drug may inhibit viral replication. To
investigate the effect of GDEPT on the replication of the adenovirus
in vivo, we used quantitative real-time PCR and measured the
adenoviral copy numbers in SW620 xenografts of mice that had
received a single tail vein injection of AdV.hTERT-CPG2 or
AdV.hTERT-CPG2 in combination with prodrug (Fig. 3A). We
detected f10 times more adenoviral particles per gram of tumor
in the GDEPT-treated animals compared with the animals that had
only been injected with the adenovirus (Fig. 3A). There was a
correlation between the adenoviral load and CPG2 enzyme activity
in the tumors; CPG2 activity levels were f3.6-fold higher in the
tumors after AdV.hTERT-CPG2 plus ZD2767P treatment, compared
with the adenovirus alone (Fig. 3B). Following a single injection of
f2.5  1010 viral particles per mouse, we detected a total viral load
in the tumors of 1.7  1011 (GDEPT) and 1.1  1011 particles (virus
only) 8 days later, a 4-fold increase over the inoculum, proving that

AdV.hTERT-CPG2 had replicated. Thus, CPG2-activated ZD2767P
does not inhibit the replication of AdV.hTERT-CPG2 in vivo.
Moreover, GDEPT facilitates the accumulation of the adenovirus in
colon cancer xenografts. Activation of ZD2767P results in higher
CPG2 expression levels from the adenovirus, which in turn results
in the conversion of a larger number of prodrug molecules,
providing an amplification effect. By contrast, it was reported that
the vaccinia/purine nucleoside phosphorylase system abolished
viral replication in the presence of the prodrug (21). Another study
described the antiviral effect of the activated prodrug generated by
a vaccinia vector expressing cytosine deaminase (22). Also,
thymidine kinase–activated prodrug inhibited the replication of
herpes simplex virus 1 vectors (23, 24), and the prodrug CB1954
was shown to block the replication of a nitroreductase-expressing
oncolytic adenovirus (25). Of note, here we find that the CPG2activated prodrug ZD2767P actually enhances the viral particle
concentration in AdV.hTERT-CPG2–infected tumors with a concomitant increase in CPG2 concentration. This positive feedback
can therefore increase both GDEPT and viral antitumor efficacy.
To our knowledge, this advantageous cooperation between an
oncolytic vector and activated prodrug has not been observed in
any other GDEPT system. Thus, AdV.hTERT-CPG2 is an excellent
vector for CPG2-mediated GDEPT in vivo.
We examined the mechanism by which the GDEPT kills
tumor cells and investigated the consequences of prodrug
activation on SW620 cells using single cell gel electrophoresis
‘‘comet’’ assays. In untreated cells, hydrogen peroxide treatment
induced DNA fragmentation, resulting in comet tails (ref. 15;
Fig. 3C). The DNA cross-linking agents nitrogen mustard and
cisplatin prevented the migration of the DNA from the nuclei,
retarding the electrophoretic mobility and reducing the comet
tails (Fig. 3C). ZD2767P alone did not induce substantial DNA

cells. Equal protein loading was confirmed by
probing the blots for ERK2. C, AdV.hTERTCPG2 increased the sensitivity of SW620 cells
to the prodrug ZD2767P. Uninfected cells
(EC50 = 309.7 Amol/L) or cells infected with the

were treated with the prodrug and the cell
viability was expressed as a percentage of
untreated controls. Sigmoidal dose-response
curves were fitted to the data and EC50 values
were calculated using GraphPad Prism
software, version 4.0a. The 95% confidence
intervals did not overlap (uninfected cells,
276.1–347.5; infected cells, 1.5–2.4 pfu/cell).

However, AdV.hTERT-CPG2 plus ZD2767P significantly reduced the
comet tails, showing that the activated prodrug cross-linked the

DNA (Fig. 3C). Cross-linking prevents DNA from being separated
for synthesis and cell division, killing the cancer cells in S-G2-M
phase, which is also when AdV.hTERT-CPG2 arrests infected cells
(Fig. 1A), suggesting that both components of our therapy may
cooperate (Fig. 1C).

We then tested whether GDEPT induces apoptosis in SW620
cells. We did two different apoptosis assays; loss of membrane
phospholipid asymmetry and selective permeability were studied
using the flow cytometric Annexin V-propidium iodide assay,

whereas PARP cleavage was assessed by Western blotting. Both
assays showed the induction of apoptosis following GDEPT
treatment (Fig. 3D). By contrast, no evidence of apoptosis was
seen in untreated cells or in cells that received either the

followed by 50 Amol/L of ZD2767P. Under
the experimental conditions used, only the
SW620 cells expressed CPG2. Cell
survival was determined as the percentage
of infected cells that did not receive any
prodrug. C, apoptosis and bystander effect
in vivo. AdV.hTERT-CPG2 was
administered via a single tail vein injection
into mice bearing SW620 xenografts,
followed by systemic ZD2767P. Detection
of CPG2 (red ), cleaved caspase-3
(a marker for apoptosis; green ), and
colocalization (yellow ) in the tumors by
immunofluorescent labeling.

AdV.hTERT-CPG2 adenovirus or the prodrug alone (Fig. 3D).
Together, these data show that CPG2-activated ZD2767P kills
human colorectal cancer cells by forming DNA cross-links and
inducing apoptosis. They also indicate that the GDEPT cooperates
with the replicating adenovirus to kill the tumor cells.
We next assessed the bystander effect of our AdV.hTERTCPG2/ZD2767P therapy using mixed cultures of WM-266-4 cells,
which are poorly infected by adenovirus and therefore do not
express CPG2 following treatment with AdV.hTERT-CPG2 and
SW620 cells, which are f800-fold more receptive to adenovirusmediated killing and express 2.9 units/g of CPG2 following
infection (Table 1). Initially, we tested whether the adenovirus
alone could mediate a bystander effect. We used a viral dose that
selectively lysed only the SW620 cells in the cocultures (0.2 pfu/
cell). Fifty percent cell death was achieved when only 8.8% of the
cells were SW620, indicating that AdV.hTERT-CPG2 could induce
bystander killing on its own in the absence of prodrug (Fig. 4A).
Next, we examined the GDEPT-mediated bystander effect. We
treated the WM-266-4/SW620 cocultures with low levels of

AdV.hTERT-CPG2 (0.002 pfu/cell) that do not mediate a
substantial viral-mediated bystander effect. Under these conditions, in the presence of ZD2767P, the GDEPT mounted a
bystander effect with 50% of the cells in the culture being killed
when only 9% of the cells were CPG2-expressing SW620 cells
(Fig. 4B). The data suggests that the AdV.hTERT/ZD2767P therapy
mounts two types of bystander effects: prodrug-mediated and
virus-mediated.
We then examined the in vivo effect of our therapy on
established tumors (Fig. 4C). We treated mice bearing SW620
xenografts systemically with AdV.hTERT-CPG2, followed by two
courses of ZD2767P, and examined the expression of CPG2 and
the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 in the tumors by
immunofluorescence. CPG2 was detected only in the tumors of
animals that had received the adenovirus, but not in the controls
or in the prodrug alone group (Fig. 4C). AdV.hTERT-CPG2
without prodrug did not activate caspase-3. By contrast,
substantial apoptosis was seen in the tumors after GDEPT
treatment (Fig. 4C). These findings confirmed the in vitro data

(Fig. 3D) and showed that the oncolytic adenovirus and GDEPT
kill tumor cells via different mechanisms, making it less likely for
resistance to the combined treatment to develop. Notably, in
GDEPT-treated tumors, we detected apoptosis in uninfected cells
that did not express CPG2, showing a GDEPT-mediated
bystander effect of the therapy in vivo (Fig. 4C). We have thus
shown an effective GDEPT system which can selectively and
systemically target CPG2 to tumors for the activation of a
prodrug capable of killing cells by apoptosis and of providing a
bystander effect.
