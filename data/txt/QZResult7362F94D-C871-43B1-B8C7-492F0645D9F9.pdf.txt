ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal of woman cancers, and its clinical
therapeutic outcome currently is unsatisfied. Dinaciclib, a novel small molecule
inhibitor of CDK1, CDK2, CDK5 and CDK9, is assessed in clinical trials for the treatment
of several types of cancers. In this study, we investigated the anticancer effects and
mechanisms of dinaciclib alone or combined with cisplatin in ovarian cancer. Dinaciclib
alone actively induced cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with the
increased intracellular ROS levels, which were accompanied by obvious alterations of
related proteins such as CDKs, Cyclins, Mcl-1, XIAP and survivin. Pretreatment with
N-acety-L-cysteine significantly blocked ROS generation but only partially rescued
apoptosis triggered by dinaciclib. Moreover, the combination of dinaciclib with
cisplatin synergistically promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and inhibited the
subcutaneous xenograft growth of ovarian cancer in nude mice. Altogether, dinaciclib
potently synergizes with cisplatin in preclinical models of ovarian cancer, indicating
this beneficial combinational therapy may be a promising strategy for treatment of
ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION

inhibitors) CKIs, loss of retinoblastoma (Rb) expression
all occur frequently in human malignancies [5, 6]. The
CDKs are a well-characterized family of serine/threonine
kinases, playing cardinal roles in regulating cell cycle
progression by phosphorylation of Rb and other substrates
[7]. Until now, eleven CDKs have been identified [8]. Cell
cycle progression requires the activity of CDK1, CDK2,
CDK4 and CDK6. CDK1-cyclin A/B, CDK2-cyclin
A/E and CDK4/6-cyclin D complexes are responsible
for driving cells through G2/M, G1/S transition and G1
phase, respectively. The irreversible arrest of cell cycle
by stresses finally leads cells to apoptosis [9]. Except
cell cycle regulation, the CDK family also has other
functions. For instance, CDK5 is important for neuronal
development [10], CDK7 is an integral component of the

Ovarian cancer currently is the second most
common gynecologic cancer in the worldwide with
a low 5-years survival rate, approximately 44% [1].
Cytoreductive surgery with platinum-based chemotherapy
was the preferred treatment for the patients with ovarian
cancer. Despite of treatment with standard strategies,
at least 60% of patients suffers the recurrent of ovarian
cancer [2]. Therefore, development of novel therapeutic
agents against ovarian cancer is an urgent necessity.
Dysregulation of cell cycle progression and aberrant
activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are
hallmarks of almost all human cancers [3, 4]. Amplification
of CDKs, overexpression of cyclins, inactivation of (CDK

transcription factor TFIIH [11], and CDK9 is involved in
the initiation and elongation steps of transcription [12-14].
Given the critical role of CDKs on regulating cell cycle
and transcription processes which are commonly abnormal
in cancer cells, targeting CDKs by small molecule
inhibitors has been suggested as a potential therapy option
for human cancers.
Dinaciclib (MK-7965, formerly SCH727965) is a
potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of CDK2,
CDK5, CDK1 and CDK9 with IC50 of 1 nM, 1 nM, 3
nM and 4 nM, respectively, and show better therapeutic
index (TI: maximum tolerated dose/minimum effective
dose; >10 vs. <1, respectively) than flavopiridol, the first
CDKs inhibitor to enter the clinic trail [15]. Preclinical
data have demonstrated that dinaciclib is active against a
broad spectrum of human cancer cell lines with median
IC50 of 11 nM by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
[15]. The phase I clinical studies showed that dinaciclib
administered at a dose of 0.33 mg/m2 as a 2-hour
intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, 15 of a 28-day cycle was
generally safe and well tolerated with the common adverse
events including nausea, decreased appetite, anemia and
fatigue [16]. The results of phase II study demonstrated
that dinaciclib administered intravenous at the 50 mg/m2
dose was well tolerated, but without antitumor activity as
monotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
[17]. In addition, another phase II trial illustrated that
dinaciclib at 50 mg/m2 administered as a 2-hour infusion
every 21 days displayed some antitumor activity and
was generally tolerated in patients with advanced breast
cancer, but efficacy was not superior to capecitabine at
1250 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily in 21-day
cycles [18]. Furthermore, dinaciclib administered at doses
of 30-50 mg/m2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle exhibited
encouraging single-agent antitumor activity in patients
with relapsed multiple myeloma [19]. Evaluation of
dinaciclib in combination with other chemotherapeutical
drugs for multiple types of cancers currently is in progress.
In this study, we investigated that anticancer effects and
mechanisms of dinaciclib alone or combined with cisplatin
in preclinical models of ovarian cancer.

dependently suppressed the growth of ovarian cancer cells
with the IC50 of 6.1773 to 14.4656 μM. However, the IC50
of dinaciclib and cisplatin in human normal embryonic
kidney HEK293T cells were 1.8243 μM and 15.9105 μM,
respectively, suggesting dinaciclib is more cytotoxic to
ovarian cancer cells than normal cells.

Dinaciclib induced cell cycle arrest in ovarian
cancer cells
To explore whether the growth inhibition of ovarian
cancer cells by dinaciclib is as a result of cell cycle
arrest, cell cycle distribution was assessed after dinaciclib
treatment. A2780 and OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells were
treated with dinaciclib (0.003, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.1 μM) for
24h and 48h, stained with PI and examined by FCM. The
cell cycle distribution was analyzed with ModFit LT 3.0
software. Interestingly, dinaciclib had the different effects
on the cell cycle distribution of A2780 and OVCAR3
cells, which enhanced the G2/M population at 0.01 μM
and G0/G1 population at 0.1 μM in A2780 cells and the S
population at 0.01 μM and G2/M population at 0.1 μM in
OVCAR3 cells with the increase of subG1 population in
both cells (Figure 2A and 2B). Next, the cell cycle related
proteins were detected by Western blot to investigate the
molecular mechanism of cell cycle arrest by dinaciclib.
After treatment with dinaciclib, the protein levels of pRb
S807/811, Cyclin A, Cyclin B, p27 and Cdk1, Cdk5,
Cdk9, which are the targets of dinaciclib, were decreased
in the time and dose dependent manners in both A2780
and OVCAR3 cells. However, the protein levels of another
target of dinaciclib Cdk2 was decreased in A2780 cells but
unchanged in OVCAR3 cells, and Cyclin E was decreased
in A2780 cells but increased in OVCAR3 cells (Figure
2C).

Dinaciclib induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer
cells
To determine whether the growth inhibition of
ovarian cancer cells by dinaciclib is also due to apoptosis,
cell apoptosis was assessed after dinaciclib treatment.
A2780 and OVCAR3 cells were treated with dinaciclib
(0.003, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.1 μM) for 48h, stained with
Annexin V/PI and examined by FCM. As shown in Figure
3A and 3B, dinaciclib dose-dependently induced early
apoptosis (Annexin V+/PI-) and late apoptosis (Annexin
V+/PI+) in both cells.Futhermore, the apoptotic related
proteins were detected by Western blot to investigate the
molecular mechanism of cell apoptosis by dinaciclib. After
treatment with dinaciclib, the cleaved PARP, which is the
marker of apoptosis, was time- and dose-dependently
generated in both cells. Furthermore, the protein levels
of XIAP, survivin, MDM2, Mcl-1, Raf-1, HSP90 and
β-catenin were significantly decreased in both cells

RESULTS
Dinaciclib inhibited the growth of ovarian cancer
cells in vitro
To evaluate the effect of dinaciclib on ovarian cancer
cells, cell survival was detected by MTT assay. Six human
ovarian cancer cell lines were treated with increasing
concentrations of dinaciclib for 72h. As shown in Figure1,
dinaciclib strongly inhibited ovarian cancer cells growth
in a dose-dependent manner with the IC50 values range
from 0.0138 to 0.1235μM. In addition, cisplatin also dosewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

signals of DHE in both A2780 and OVCAR3 cells in the
concentration-and time-dependent manners, suggesting
the intracellular ROS levels were enhanced after dinaciclib
treatment. To further verify the relationship between
dinaciclib induced apoptosis and ROS generation, both
cells were treated with dinaciclib for 48h in the presence
or absence of the antioxidative agent NAC pretreatment
for 1h and stained with DHE. The dinaciclib-induced DHE
fluorescent signals were totally reversed by NAC in both
cells (Figure 4B). Moreover, cell apoptosis was detected
by FCM with Annexin V/PI staining. The dinaciclibinduced apoptosis were partially blocked by NAC in both
cells (Figure 4C and 4D), suggesting dinaciclib can induce
both ROS dependent and independent apoptosis.

ROS was critical for the anticancer effect of
dinaciclib in ovarian cancer cells
ROS plays an important role in tumorigenesis and
chemotherapy of most anticancer drugs [20]. To assess the
role of ROS in the anticancer effect of dinaciclib in ovarian
cancer cells, we used dihydroethidium (DHE) as ROS
fluorescent probe, which can be oxidized by ROS to oxide
ethidium that binds with DNA to emit the detectable red
fluorescence [21], to stain cells treated with dinaciclib. As
shown in Figure 4A, dinaciclib enhanced the fluorescent

growth of ovarian cancer cells in vitro

Dinaciclib synergized with cisplatin to induce cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells

Combination therapy is the main mode of cancer
chemotherapy because of its significant advantages such
as slower development of drug resistance and lower
treatment failure rate [22]. Cisplatin currently is the firstline chemotherapeutic drug for ovarian cancer in clinic. To
check the combined effects of dinaciclib and cisplatin on
ovarian cancer cells, cell survival was detected by MTT
assay. After combined treatment with dinaciclib (0.001,
0.003, 0.01 and 0.03 μM) and cisplatin (0.3, 1, 3, 10 and
30 μM), the survival of cells was significantly reduced
in compared with dinaciclib or cisplatin alone treatment
in both A2780 and OVCAR3 cells. Almost all CI values
of combination were <1 (Figure 5A and 5B), suggesting
that the antigrowth effects of dinaciclib combined
with cispaltin in the indicated ovarian cancer cells was
synergistic rather than additive.

To further estimate the synergistic effects of
dinaciclib and cisplatin on ovarian cancer cells, cell
cycle distribution and apoptosis were examined by FCM
with PI and Annexin V/PI staining. In A2780 cells,
either dinaciclib or cisplatin alone treatment induced the
accumulation in G2/M phase and reduction in G0/G1
phase of cell population, and co-treatment with dinaciclib
and cisplatin induced the more significant accumulation
in G2/M phase and reduction in G0/G1 phase of cell
population (Figure 6A). While in OVCAR3 cells,
dinaciclib alone treatment induced the accumulation in S
phase and reduction in G0/G1 phase of cell population,
and cisplatin alone treatment induced the accumulation
in G2/M phase and reduction in G0/G1 phase of cell
population, and co-treatment with dinaciclib and cisplatin
induced the dramatical accumulation in G2/M phase and

reduction in G0/G1 phase of cell population (Figure 6B).
Additionally, either dinaciclib or cisplatin alone treatment
caused mild apoptosis, and co-treatment with dinaciclib
and cisplatin caused significant apoptosis in both cells
(Figure 6C and 6D).Moreover, the related proteins of
cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by Western blot to
investigate the molecular mechanism of the synergistic
effects of dinaciclib and cisplatin on cell cycle and
apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. As shown in Figure 6E,
either dinaciclib or cisplatin alone treatment moderately
increased the protein levels of C-PARP and decreased the
protein levels of XIAP and survivin, and co-treatment with
dinaciclib and cisplatin significantly increased the protein
levels of C-PARP and decreased the protein levels of XIAP
and survivin. Interestingly, the protein levels of Cyclin B
were increased moderately in either dinaciclib or cisplatin
alone group and significantly in the combination group of
dinaciclib with cisplatin in A2780 cells, but deceased in
OVCAR3 cells.

cells with the reduced protein expressions of anti-apoptotic
proteins including Mcl-1, XIAP, survivin, etc. Notably,
Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL levels in solid tumors are the predictive
biomarkers for dinaciclib induced apoptosis and antiumor
response [29], and dinaciclib potently inhibits Mcl-1 to
induce durable apoptosis in aggressive MYC-driven B-cell
lymphoma [30]. Therefore, detection of Mcl-1 levels in
tumor tissues may be a valuable strategy to identify cancer
patients most probably respond to dinaciclib.
The intracellular ROS plays an important role
in regulating various cell physiological process such
as growth, differentiation, death, and so on [31]. ROS
can change the cellular redox condition, induce DNA
damage, and influence the activities of oncogene or
tumor suppressor, thereby involving in the initiation and
progression of cancer [32]. Cancer cells usually exhibit
increased basal levels of intrinsic oxidative stress, and
a further elevation of intracellular ROS above the toxic
threshold level may result in cell death [33]. Accordingly,
this oxidative shift may cause cancer cells susceptible
to chemotherapeutic agents that work by amplifying
ROS generation [34]. However, apoptosis induced by
some stimuli is independent of ROS generation such as
etoposide-induced apoptosis in B lymphoma cells [35],
emodin-induced apoptosis in promyeloleukemic cells [36].
In addition, several anti-oxidant agents including vitamin
E are able to induce apoptosis in cancer cells [37].Similar
to other CDK inhibitors flavopiridol and roscovitine
[38, 39], dinaciclib also can enhance the intracellular
ROS levels, and NAC pretreatment dramatically blocks
ROS generation but partially rescues dinaciclib-induced
apoptosis in the current study. Our results suggest that
dinaciclib is able to prompt both ROS dependent and
independent apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells.Cisplatin is
the first member of platinum-containing family anticancer
drugs, which also includes carboplatin and oxaliplatin,
to trigger cancer cells death by binding to and causing
crosslinking of DNA, and now is used to treat various
types of cancers including ovarian cancer, lung cancer,
sarcomas, germ cell tumors, etc [40]. It has been reported
that cisplatin combined with flavopiridol is highly
synergistic to kill cancer cells in the preclinical settings
[41], and this combination is active for cancer patients
based on the encouraging results of two clinical trial [42,
43]. Interestingly, compared with parental cells, ovarian
cancer cells resistant to flavopiridol and cisplatin showed
the increased expressions of CDK1, cyclin D3 and Rb,
decreased expressions of cyclin B, and equal expressions
of cyclin A, cyclin E, CDK2, CDK4 [44]. Recently, it has
demonstrated that increased DNA ploidy is associated
with resistance to dinaciclib in ovarian cancer cells [45].
Dinaciclib has shown a synergistic anticancer effect when
combined with other chemotherapeutic agents including
gemcitabine, vinblastin and NVP-AUY922 in pancreatic
cancer, leukemia and osteosarcoma, respectively [46-48].
Additionally, dinaciclib in combination with rituximab

Dinaciclib synergized with cisplatin to inhibit the
subcutaneous xenograft growth of ovarian cancer
in nude mice
To test the synergistic antitumor effects of dinaciclib
and cisplatin in vivo, we generated the subcutaneous
xenograft tumor models by transplanting A2780 cells into
nude mice. As shown in Figure 7A and 7B, compared with
dinaciclib or cisplatin alone treatment, co-treatment with
dinaciclib and cisplatin clearly inhibited the tumors growth
by reducing the volume and weight of A2780 tumors. The
inhibition rates of tumor growth in the combined group
were 80.7%, which were significantly higher than those
in cisplatin (42.8%) or dinaciclib (57.7%) alone group
(Figure 7C). Nevertheless, the net body weights (without
tumor) of mice in the combined group were lower than
those in control group, suggesting co-treatment of
dinaciclib and cisplatin at the indicated dose caused
certain side effects in mice (Figure 7B).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we show that dinaciclib has the potent
ability to induce cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis with the increased intracellular ROS levels
in human ovarian cancer cells. Interestingly, treatment with
dinaciclib leads to the different distribution of cell cycle
in our tested two ovarian cancer cells, which accompanies
the distinct protein expressions of some important cell
cycle related protein such as Cdk2 and cyclin E. Thus, the
cell cycle responses of ovarian cancer cells to dinaciclib
are variable and may be due to cellular genotype. Previous
publications demonstrate that dinaciclib is able to promote
apoptosis in multiple types of cancers [15, 23-28]. In our
case, dinaciclib also triggers apoptosis in ovarian cancer

is well tolerated and has favorable clinical activity in
relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients
[49]. In our study, co-treatment with dinaciclib and
cisplatin synergistically induces cell growth inhibition,
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells,
and further suppresses the subcutaneous xenograft growth
of ovarian cancer in nude mice. It has reported that
dinaciclib is metabolized by CYP3A4 [50], and cisplatin
is the substrate of SLC22A1, SLC22A2, SLC31A1,
ABCC2, ABCC4, ATP7B and SLC47A1 transporters
[51]. Whether dinaciclib could affect the pharmacokinetic,
pharmacodynamic and clinical outcome of cisplatin in
ovarian cancer patients remains to be determined.
In conclusion, our study not only demonstrates that
monotherapy with dinaciclib is highly active in inducing
ovarian cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro
and in vivo, but also shows that combinational treatment
with dinaciclib and cisplatin synergistically inhibit cells
growth in preclinical models of ovarian cancer. Dinaciclib
in combination with cisplatin shows potently synergistic
anticancer effect, indicating this beneficial combinational
therapy may be a promising strategy for treatment of
ovarian cancer.

Cells were firstly seeded into a 96-well plate
at a density of 5000 cells per well, and incubated
with drugs in three parallel wells for 72 h. Then 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) was added to each well at a final concentration
of 0.5 mg/ml. After incubation for 4 h, formazan crystals
were dissolved in 100 ml of DMSO, and absorbance at
570 nm was measured by plate reader. The concentrations
required to inhibit growth by 50% (IC50) were calculated
from survival curves using the Bliss method [52, 53].
For drug combination experiments, cells were co-treated
with different concentrations of dinaciclib and cisplatin
for 72 h. The data were analyzed by CompuSyn software
with the results showed as combination index (CI) values
according to the median-effect principle, where CI <1,
=1, and >1 indicate synergism, additive effect, and
antagonism, respectively [21, 54].

Cell cycle assay
Cells were harvested and washed twice with cold
phosphate‑buffered saline (PBS), then fixed with ice-cold
70% ethanol for 30 min at 4°C. After centrifugation at 200
× g for 10 min, cells were washed twice with PBS and
resuspended with 0.5 ml PBS containing PI (50 μg/ml),
0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate, and DNase-free
RNase (100 μg/ml), and detected by FCM after 15 min
incubation at room temperature in the dark. Fluorescence
was measured at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm
through a FL-2filter (585 nm). Data were analyzed using
ModFit LT 3.0 software (Becton Dickinson).

Cells were harvested and washed twice with cold
PBS, then resuspended and lysed in RIPA buffer (1%
NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 ng/
ml PMSF, 0.03% aprotinin, 1μM sodium orthovanadate)
at 4°C for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min
at 14,000 × g and supernatants were stored at -80 °C as
whole cell extracts. Total protein concentrations were
determined with Bradford assay. Proteins were separated
on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked with
5% BSA and incubated with the indicated primary
antibodies. Corresponding horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies were used against
each primary antibody. Proteins were detected using the
chemiluminescent detection reagents and films.

In vivo tumor xenograft assay

REFERENCES

Balb/c nude mice were obtained from the
Guangdong Medical Laboratory Animal Center and
maintained with sterilized food and water. Six female nude
mice with 5 weeks old and around 15 g weight were used
for each group. Each mouse was injected subcutaneously
with A2780 cells (2 × 106 in 100 μl of medium) under
the shoulder. When the subcutaneous tumors were
approximately 0.3 × 0.3 cm2 (two perpendicular
diameters) in size, mice were randomized into four groups,
and were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle alone
(20% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin), dinaciclib alone
(25 mg/kg), cisplatin alone (2 mg/kg), or a combination
of dinaciclib and cisplatin every four days. The body
weights of mice and the two perpendicular diameters (A
and B) of tumors were recorded. The tumor volume (V)
was calculated according to the formula:
