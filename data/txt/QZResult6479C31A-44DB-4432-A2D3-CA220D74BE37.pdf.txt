Abstract
Dose-dense (DD) regimens of combination chemotherapy may produce superior clinical outcomes, but the
basis for these effects are not completely clear. In this study, we assessed whether a DD combinatorial regimen of
low-dose cisplatin and paclitaxel produces superior immune-mediated efﬁcacy when compared with a maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) regimen in treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer as modeled in mice. Immune
responses generated by the DD regimen were identiﬁed with regard to the immune cell subset responsible for the
antitumor effects observed. The DD regimen was less toxic to the immune system, reduced immunosuppression
by the tumor microenvironment, and triggered recruitment of macrophages and tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell
responses to tumors [as determined by interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-g secretion]. In this model, we found that the
DD regimen exerted greater therapeutic effects than the MTD regimen, justifying its further clinical investigation.
Fourteen patients with platinum-resistant relapse of ovarian cancer received DD chemotherapy consisting of
weekly carboplatin (AUC2) and paclitaxel (60–80 mg/m2) as the third- or fourth-line treatment. Serum was
collected over the course of treatment, and serial IFN-g and IL-2 levels were used to determine CD8þ T-cell
activation. Of the four patients with disease control, three had serum levels of IL-2 and IFN-g associated with
cytotoxic CD8þ T-cell activity. The therapeutic effect of the DD chemotherapy relied on the preservation of the
immune system and the treatment-mediated promotion of tumor-speciﬁc immunity, especially the antitumor
CD8þ T-cell response. Because the DD regimen controlled drug-resistant disease through a novel immune
mechanism, it may offer a ﬁne strategy for salvage treatment. Cancer Res; 73(1); 119–27. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) has the highest mortality rate among gynecologic malignancies, as it is typically
asymptomatic and undiagnosed until the disease has progressed to advanced stages. Typical treatment for ovarian
cancer is cytoreductive surgery when possible, followed by
adjuvant chemotherapy. The introduction of modern platinum-based combination chemotherapy with paclitaxel has
improved the 5-year survival rate of patients with advanced
EOCs; however, long-term prognosis remains unfavorable.
Disease relapse, acquired drug resistance, and short duration
of progression-free survival are common and therefore, have
motivated the search for better treatments.

Few phase III trials that investigated modiﬁcations to standard chemotherapy have produced encouraging results (1–3).
Thus far, the condensed treatment interval method ﬁrst advocated by van der Burg and colleagues, now known as dosedense (DD) chemotherapy, is considered to be one of the most
promising treatment strategy (4). Theoretically, DD regimen
deprives cancer cells the opportunity to proliferate and
impedes tumor progression via the antiangiogenic effects of
paclitaxel (5). However, DD regimen is not without complications, as it may be overly hematologically toxic and consequently force the premature cessation of treatment (5). To
offset toxicity and enhance treatment tolerability, DD regimen
may be modiﬁed to use low drug dosages (6, 7).
The clinical trials of DD platinum-based combination chemotherapy have reported promising outcomes for patients
with advanced EOCs. One randomized phase I/II trial investigating the efﬁcacy of cisplatin and paclitaxel found response
rates of 94% for chemotherapy-na€ve patients and 84% for
patients with recurrent disease (8). Another phase II study of
weekly cisplatin with an etoposide reported similar results (4).
The Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG 3016)
conducted a randomized phase III trial comparison of MTD
treatment versus DD treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
The "partial" dose dense protocol, consisting of six 21-day
cycles of intravenous carboplatin (AUC 6) on day 1 in addition
to paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, and 15, signiﬁcantly
lengthened the median progression-free survival of patients

(5). Notably, evidence suggests that DD platinum-based combination therapy is a worthwhile option that can be safely
extended, even for heavily treated patients with notoriously
difﬁcult drug-resistant disease (9). In theory, patients with
platinum-resistant disease should be unresponsive to any
platinum-based treatment; however, this supposition is contradicted by evidence. We speculate that platinum agent and
paclitaxel given in a DD schedule at low dosages lead to the use
of an immune-mediated tumor-killing pathway that is compromised when the drugs are given in the MTD regimen.
This study compares the efﬁcacy and toxicity of platinumbased combination therapy administered in the DD and MTD
regimen. We then determined whether antitumor effects
involved the immune system. Because the experimental results
from mouse models of platinum-resistant tumors suggested
the DD regimen is superior and has immune-mediated efﬁcacy,
the treatment was examined in 14 patients with relapse of
EOCs.

Materials and Methods
Mouse and cell lines
C57BL/6, (C57BL/6C3/He) F1 mice, and athymic nude
mice were purchased from BioLASCO. All animals were maintained under speciﬁc pathogen-free conditions. All procedures
were conducted in accordance with approved protocols and
recommendations for the proper care and use of laboratory
animals. Mouse ovarian cancer cell lines, HM-1 (C57BL/6C3/
He F1 origin) and ID8, were used to establish the tumor model
in syngeneic mice. ID8 was derived from the mouse ovarian
cancer cell line, MOSEC (C57BL/6 origin), and carries the
luciferase gene to enable in vivo imaging. The cells were
cultured in MEM medium (Gibco-BRL) with 10% FBS
(Hyclone), 100 U/mL penicillin (Gibco), and 100 pg/mL streptomycin (Sigma) under the condition of humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5% CO2/95% air at 37 C. Intraperitoneal tumor
growth was monitored by in vivo imaging of tumor luminescence (indicating tumor load) by Xenogen IVIS 200 Imaging
System.

(3 mg/kg)] or MTD format [three 10-day cycles of paclitaxel (12
mg/kg) plus cisplatin (7 mg/kg)]. Other sets of mice were given
the single-agent treatment either with paclitaxel (16 mg/kg in
DD, 40 mg/kg in MTD) or cisplatin (10 mg/kg in DD, 25 mg/kg
in MTD) at the same intervals. Chemotherapeutic drugs,
paclitaxel (Taxol) and cisplatin (Platinex) were purchased from
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company under the approval of the
pharmaceutical committee in Mackay Memorial Hospital
(Taipei, Taiwan). Control group mice were treated with PBS
at 3-day intervals. R ID8 cells (5  105) were intraperitoneally
(i.p.) injected into C5BL/6 mice on days 0 and 5. On day 7, mice
began treatment. Depletion of lymphocyte subpopulation was
achieved through i.p. injection with 100 mg of rat monoclonal
antibody GK1.5 (anti-CD4), 2.43 (anti-CD8), or PK136 (antiNK1.1). Depletion was initiated 1 week before tumor challenge
and continued every other day for the ﬁrst week, followed by
once per week after. Depletion was assessed 1 day after the
fourth administration of antibodies by ﬂow cytometric analysis
of spleen cells stained with 2.43, GK1.5, or PK136 to conﬁrm the
depletion of CD8, CD4, or natural killer (NK) cells. Depletion
was maintained by weekly antibody injections for the duration
of the tumor growth follow-up.

Development of cisplatin-resistant cell line and
cytotoxicity assay
Cisplatin-resistant cell lines (R HM-1) and (R ID8) were
produced by culturing the cells with escalating doses of
cisplatin (0.1–2 mg/mL of cisplatin within 2 months, maintained at 2 mg/mL). In vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT
assay in accordance with protocol of the manufacturer (SigmaAldrich). The absorbance of each well was measured at 570/630
nm within a microplate reader. Each measurement was taken
in triplicates and presented as mean  SD.

Intracellular cytokine staining and ﬂow cytometry
analysis for immunoassay
After chemotherapy, cells were harvested from the peritoneal lavage of tumor-bearing mice. Analysis of tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL) was conducted on the R HM-1 tumors
extracted from mice treated with DD, MTD, or control PBS. R
HM-1 tumors were dissected, weighed, chopped into small
pieces, and washed with HBSS. Tissues were incubated with a
mixture of enzymes [collagenase type I (Gibco), collagenase
type IV (Gibco), hyaluronidase (Sigma), and DNase I (Sigma)]
in HBSS for 15 minutes at 37 C. After enzyme digestion,
dissociated single cells were harvested and cultured in 24-well
plates coated with monoclonal antibody OKT3 for 18 hours.
For antigen stimulation, isolated cells (5  106) from each
group were harvested and cultured in vitro with 2  105 live
HM-1 or ID8 cells in culture medium containing IL-2 (100
U/mL) for 1 day. They were then cultured in medium added
with 2 mg Golgistop (BD Pharmingen) for another 18 hours.
Cells were then washed once in FACScan buffer and stained
with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated monoclonal rat anti–
mouse CD8a (1:100; eBioscience) for 20 minutes, and ﬁxed
using the Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm kit in accordance to manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen), followed by staining
with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rat anti–
mouse IFN-g (1:50; eBioscience) for 20 minutes. Flow cytometric analysis was conducted on a Becton Dickinson FACScan (BD FACSCalibur). Each group was measured in triplicate.

Tumor treatment model and depletion of lymphocyte
subpopulations
One million R HM-1 cells were inoculated subcutaneously
in the left thigh of (C57BL/6C3/He) F1 mice and athymic
nude mice (day 0, 5 in each group). On day 4, mice began
receiving paclitaxel and cisplatin intraperitoneally in either DD
format [seven 3-day cycles of paclitaxel (5 mg/kg) plus cisplatin

Peritoneal lavage and cytokine assays
The peritoneal cavity of experimental and control R ID8
tumor–bearing mice was lavaged with HBSS to obtain cells.
The washout was passed through a 35-mm nylon mesh and
collected. After red blood cell (RBC) lysis and repeated washes,
cells were processed for in vitro culture and stimulation for
further intracellular cytokine staining and ﬂow cytometric

analysis as previously mentioned. In addition, CD8þ cells were
isolated from pelleted cells using beads coated with CD8
antibody (MACs, MiltenyiBiotec). Isolated CD8þ cells were
subjected to RNA extraction then quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) for the expression proﬁling of IFN-g and IL-2.
Human serum IFN-g and IL-2 were quantiﬁed using multiplex
bead-based assays (BD Cytometric Bead Array) and then
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry in accordance with manufacturer's protocol. Blood samples from patients were obtained
before treatment, 1 month after the initiation of treatment,
and 2 months after the initiation of treatment). Patient
enrollment was limited to those with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer recurrence who will receive weekly carboplatin
(AUC 2) and paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) as the third- or fourth-line
treatment.

were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.
Statistical analysis
All data expressed as means  SE are representative of at
least 2 different experiments. Comparisons between individual
data points were made using the Student t test or ANOVA.

Macrophage inhibition
Cisplatin-resistant (R HM-1) cells (1  106) were s.c. injected
into female (C57BL/6 C3H/He) F1 mice on day 0 (5 in each
group). On day 4, mice began DD regimen [seven 3-day cycles of
paclitaxel (5 mg/kg) plus cisplatin (3 mg/kg)]. The control
group mice were treated by PBS. Macrophage inhibitor, clodronate liposome (Encapsula NanoScience), and control liposome were i.p. administered since day 1 (1.5 mg/mice at 5-day
intervals).

Results
DD chemotherapy was more effective in controlling
platinum-resistant HM-1 tumor
Tumor-bearing mice treated by DD regimen received 7
cycles (3-day intervals) of paclitaxel (5 mg/kg) and cisplatin
(3 mg/kg). Mice treated by MTD regimen received 3 courses
(10-day interval) of higher dosages of paclitaxel (12 mg/kg) and
cisplatin (7 mg/kg) by i.p. injection. The control group received
PBS. MTD chemotherapy did not signiﬁcantly reduce the size
of R HM-1 tumor, unlike DD chemotherapy (P ¼ 0.017, control
vs. DD; Fig. 1A). The R HM-1 tumor was chemosensitive when
low-dose cisplatin and paclitaxel were administered by DD
protocol. DD efﬁcacy was also better than MTD, even using
treatment with single-agent cisplatin or paclitaxel (P ¼ 0.0003,
DD vs. MTD cisplatin; P ¼ 0.002, DD vs. MTD paclitaxel;

mg/kg cisplatin in a 3-day interval for 7 courses) or MTD (12 mg/kg paclitaxel plus 7 mg/kg cisplatin in a10-day interval for 3 courses) regimen. Control group mice
were treated with PBS in 3-day interval. Signiﬁcant therapeutic efﬁcacy was noted in mice treated by DD chemotherapy (#, P ¼ 0.017, control vs. DD), which was
better than that of MTD (P ¼ 0.039, MTD vs. DD). B, the speciﬁc antitumor effect of DD chemotherapy on R HM-1 cells was abolished in nude mice,
suggesting that host immunity might be involved in the tumor elimination. Cisplatin-resistant HM-1 cells (1  106) were injected s.c. into female athymic nude
mice (5 in each group, day 0). On day 4, mice began intraperitoneal administration of paclitaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy given in either DD (5 mg/kg paclitaxel
plus 3 mg/kg cisplatin in a 3-day interval for 7 courses) or MTD (12 mg/kg paclitaxel plus 7 mg/kg cisplatin in a10-day interval for 3 courses) format. Control group
mice were treated with PBS in a 3-day interval. There is no difference in the tumor size between the different groups of immune-deﬁcient mice.

Supplementary Fig. S1). This suggests the therapeutic effect is
not dose-dependent and might involve another mechanism
that we theorize to be immunologic.

DD chemotherapy preferentially decreased myeloidderived suppressor cells
DD chemotherapy signiﬁcantly reduced the number of
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) found in tumorbearing mice, whereas the same phenomenon was not
observed in the control and MTD groups (P < 0.0001, DD vs.
control; P < 0.001, DD vs. MTD; Fig. 2B). Selective cytotoxicity
toward immunosuppressive MDSCs is important for overcoming cancer immune tolerance, as MDSCs mediate T-cell anergy
and promote the development of regulatory T (Treg) cells that
inhibit effective antitumor immune response (10, 11). Other
treatments found to preferentially reduce MDSCs have also
documented a corresponding boost in the response of T cells
and number of TILs with associated therapeutic response
(12–14).

Therapeutic effect of DD chemotherapy against
platinum-resistant tumor is immune-dependent
DD chemotherapy did not produce the same therapeutic
effect in immunodeﬁcient tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 1B). The
immune proﬁle (CD8þ, CD4þ, NK, CD11bþ, CD11cþ, and
F4/80þ cells) of mice following treatment showed that the
MTD regimen was toxic to all the immune cells of interest,
whereas DD regimen preserved CD8þ, CD4þ, and CD11bþ
cells with minimal reduction of NK, CD11Cþ, and F4/80þ cell
count (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively;

Dose-Dense Chemotherapy and Antitumor Immune Response

ted with MTD regimen (P < 0.001, control vs. DD, control vs.
MTD; Fig. 3A).
The association of tumor macrophage recruitment with
antitumor effect was investigated with the administration
of macrophage inhibitor, clodronate liposome. The tumor
growth curve showed that clodronate liposome partially
abolished the antitumor effect of DD chemotherapy, whereas the same was not observed in the control group that only
received the vehicle (liposome; P ¼ 0.01, clodronate liposome vs. liposome only; Fig. 3B). We believe the recruitment
of macrophages to the tumor is a component of treatment
efﬁcacy.

Ideally, cancer treatment should also be able to interfere
with Treg function or quantity. The primary function of Treg is
to maintain peripheral tolerance by suppressing self-reactive T
cells that have escaped the primary lymph node; however, the
prevention of autoimmunity also contributes to cancer
immune tolerance (15). In mouse tumor models, the reduction
of Treg cells with low-dose cyclophosphamide was able to
recover the antitumor effects induced by immunotherapy (16–
18). While the present study did not ﬁnd DD regimen to be
more effective than MTD regimen at reducing the percentage
of CD4þCD25þ Treg cells (P ¼ 0.85; Fig. 2C), both regimens led
to the decline of Treg count (P ¼ 0.048, control vs. DD; Fig. 2C).
From this, we believe cisplatin and paclitaxel to have an
intrinsic, dose-independent drug effect that is selectively cytotoxic to Treg cells.

DD chemotherapy promotes tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ
T lymphocytes responsible for therapeutic effect against
platinum-resistant tumor
To delineate the effector cell types responsible for the
antitumor effect of a treatment, selective depletion of lymphocyte subpopulations was achieved by injecting monoclonal
antibodies against CD8, CD4, or NK1.1 in R HM-1 tumor–
bearing mice. Tumor growth curve indicated the antitumor
effect of DD regimen was most dependent on CD8þ T cells

A, DD chemotherapy induced a large amount of F4/80 cells in the peritoneum of tumor-bearing mice. Cells were obtained through peritoneal lavage
with 10 mL of PBS in R HM-1 tumor–bearing mice treated with different formats of chemotherapy. Mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient.
Representative ﬂow cytometric data show that a larger population of F4/80þ cells was elicited by DD chemotherapy (12,690 in 20,000 cells analyzed),
whereas in mice receiving MTD chemotherapy, the population of F4/80þ cells became scant (1,571 in 20,000 cells).   , P < 0.001, control versus DD, control

control liposome began on day 1 (1.5 mg/mice) and were intraperitoneally administered at a 5-day interval. Administration of clodronate liposome reduced the
antitumor effect by DD chemotherapy in comparison to the vehicle (liposome) control ( , P ¼ 0.01, clodronate liposome vs. liposome only;   , P < 0.001).

Figure 4. DD therapeutic effect on drug-resistant tumor is immune dependent and mediated by CD8 effector cells. A, the use of neutralizing antibodies for
depletion of lymphocyte subpopulations revealed that CD8þ T cells are essential for tumor eradication. R HM-1 cells (1  106) were injected s.c. into female
(C57BL/6, C3H/He) F1 mice (5 in each group, day 0). Neutralizing antibodies were given i.p. (100 mg/mice/d initiated on D1, given every other day for
2 weeks, then 200 mg/mice/d every week). On day 4, mice began DD format chemotherapy. Control group mice were treated with PBS. Tumor growth curve
shows that antitumor effect was abolished when CD8þ cells were depleted by anti-CD8 antibody (  , P < 0.001, anti-CD8 vs. rat IgG), whereas the anti-CD4
and anti-NK antibodies did not affect tumor growth. B, in the absence of CD8þ T lymphocytes, MTD shows moderately more therapeutic effect than DD. R HM1 cells (1  106) were injected s.c. into female (C57BL/6, C3H/He) F1 mice (5 in each group, day 0). Neutralizing antibodies were given i.p. (100 mg/mice/d
initiated on D1, given every other day for 2 weeks, then 200 mg/mice/d every week). Lymphocyte depletion assay failed to identify a speciﬁc population of
effectors cells that is associated with antitumor effects of MTD chemotherapy for R HM-1 tumor. C, in tumor-bearing mice, DD chemotherapy elicited
antitumor CD8þIFN-g þ T lymphocytic reaction. Mice bearing R HM-1 tumor were treated with different formats of chemotherapies. After treatment, spleens
were obtained, and the single-cell splenocyte suspension was prepared by tissue dissociation and enzyme digestion. Cells were then stained with anti–mouse
CD8 and anti–mouse IFN-g antibodies before getting analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Representative ﬂow cytometric data show that CD8þIFN-g þ cells
were found in greater numbers in the mice receiving DD chemotherapy (  , P < 0.001, DD vs. control and MTD). D, representative ﬂow cytometric data show
that more tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þIFN-g þ T lymphocytes were also induced in mice treated by DD (  , P < 0.001, DD vs. control and MTD).

(P < 0.001, anti-CD8 vs. rat IgG; Fig. 4A), whereas the antitumor
effect of MTD regimen did not seem to be associated with any
of the monitored immune cells (Fig. 4B). Subsequently, we
found DD chemotherapy-induced tumor-speciﬁc immune
responses. Flow cytometric analysis of the splenocytes identiﬁed CD8þIFN-gþ T cells in mice that received DD treatment
(P < 0.001, DD vs. control and MTD; Fig. 4C). Moreover, the
percentage of tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þIFN-g þ T cells was highest in mice treated with DD chemotherapy than in those
treated with MTD or control (P < 0.001, DD vs. control and
MTD). The R HM-1 tumor model experiments have shown that
DD regimen with cisplatin and paclitaxel promotes tumor
macrophage recruitment, reduces immunosuppression of the
tumor microenvironment, and elicits tumor-speciﬁc antitumor CD8þ T-cell responses.

DD regimen results were validated in another
intraperitoneal ovarian tumor model
We conducted the same experiments in the ID8 tumor
model. ID8 is another aggressive mouse ovarian cancer cell
line that is derived from the MOSEC cell line (19). In this
platinum-resistant tumor model, DD regimen was again
more effective than MTD regimen (P ¼ 0.022, DD vs. MTD;
Supplementary Fig. S2). Akin to the R HM-1 tumor model
experiments, DD regimen induced the recruitment of
CD14þF4/80þ macrophages into the peritoneal cavity of
ID8 tumor–bearing mice (P < 0.001, control vs. DD; P < 0.01,
DD vs. MTD; Fig. 5A). DD treatment of tumor-na€ve mice had
no macrophage recruitment to the abdominal cavity (Fig.
5B). Flow cytometric analysis found a high proportion of
activated IFN-g–secreting macrophages following DD

Figure 5. DD chemotherapy elicited the greatest number of IFN-g–secreting CD14 F4/80þ macrophage and subsequent CD8 IFN-g TILs inside the
peritoneal cavity of tumor-bearing mice. A, in this i.p. tumor model, DD chemotherapy elicited and recruited largest number of CD14þF4/80þ
macrophages inside the peritoneal cavity of R ID8 tumor–bearing mice (  , P < 0.001, control vs. DD;  , P < 0.01, DD vs. MTD). B, the proportion of
macrophage did not change in tumor-naïve mice regardless of chemotherapy. C, ﬂow cytometric analysis indicated more activated macrophages, as
determined by IFN-g secretion, after DD chemotherapy. Following treatment, cells from the peritoneal lavage of R ID8 tumor–bearing mice were
cultured in medium with protein transporter inhibitor BD GolgiPlug. Cells were stained with anti–mouse F4/80 PE, as well as anti–mouse IFN-g FITC
antibodies before analysis by ﬂow cytometry. Representative data show the number of F4/80þ IFN-g þ cells increased in mice receiving DD
chemotherapy but not in the mice receiving MTD and PBS (control; 8.16% in DD vs. 2.11% in MTD and 2.31% in control, both;    , P < 0.0001). D, in ID8
tumor–bearing mice, DD chemotherapy elicited CD8þIFN-g þ TILs. Mice bearing R ID8 tumor were treated with different formats of chemotherapies.
After treatment, peritoneal cells were obtained by lavage and prepared for single-cell suspension. Cells were then stained with anti–mouse CD8 and
anti–mouse IFN-g antibodies before getting analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Representative ﬂow cytometric data show that peritoneal CD8þIFN-g þ
cells were found in greater numbers within the tumors of mice receiving DD chemotherapy (  , P < 0.001, control vs. DD and DD vs. MTD). E, CD8þ T
cells from peritoneal lavage in mice treated with different formats of chemotherapies were isolated and examined for the expression of IFN-g and IL-2 by
QPCR. A signiﬁcant enhancement in the expressions of IFN-g and IL-2 was noted in the peritoneal CD8þ cells in DD group mice (IFN-g,  , P < 0.01,
control vs. DD, DD vs. MTD, IL-2;  , P < 0.01, control vs. DD; #, P ¼ 0.034, DD vs. MTD).

treatment, whereas MTD chemotherapy and PBS (control)
did not produce the same results (8.16% vs. 2.11% and 2.31%,
both P < 0.0001; Fig. 5C). Higher numbers of activated CD8þ
T cells were puriﬁed from the peritoneal lavage of mice given
DD chemotherapy (P < 0.001, control vs. DD and DD vs.
MTD; Fig. 5D). Following DD treatment, CD8þ T cell from
the peritoneal lavage of tumor-bearing mice again had
higher levels of IFN-g and IL-2 (IFN-g, P < 0.01, control vs.
DD, DD vs. MTD; IL-2, P < 0.01, control vs. DD, P ¼ 0.034, DD
vs. MTD; Fig. 5E). The expression of IFN-g and IL-2 is known
to accompany the activation of cytotoxic T cells. DD chemo-

Figure 6. Patients who responded to DD chemotherapy had higher
serum levels of IFN-g and IL-2. Fourteen patients with platinumresistant recurrence of ovarian cancer received DD chemotherapy with
weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) plus paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) as their third or
fourth line of treatment. Their serum levels of IFN-g and IL-2 were
measured before treatment (PreDD), 1 month after (DD1), and 2
months after (DD2) the start of DD chemotherapy. Of the four patients
whose disease was controlled, 3 had higher serum levels of IFN-g and
IL-2 (red), whereas patients with no response had low or undetectable
levels of IFN-g or IL-2 (black; DD2 for IFN-g;   , P < 0.001, responsive
vs. unresponsive; DD1 and DD2 for IL-2,   , P < 0.001 responsive vs.
unresponsive).

(80 mg/m2) as their third- or fourth-line treatment. Disease
control was deﬁned as: (i) stable or lowered CA-125 levels
[Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup Committee (GCIC) criteria]
over the period of 2 or more consecutive months or (ii) no
change/shrinkage of tumor size over the period of 2 or more
months [Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) 1.1 CT scan criteria]. Patient serum levels of IFN-g
and IL-2 were determined by blood samples obtained before
treatment, 1 month, and 2 months into treatment. DD chemotherapy controlled the disease in 4 (28.6%) of 14 patients. Of
these 4 patients, 3 patients had higher levels of serum IFN-g and
IL-2 2 months after the start of chemotherapy (DD2 for IFN-g, P
< 0.001, responsive vs. unresponsive; DD1 and DD2 for IL-2, P <
0.001 responsive vs. unresponsive; Fig. 6). Although the sample
size was small, the patient results corroborate what we saw in
the mouse tumor models and suggest that this treatment
warrants further investigation in a larger study. On the basis
of the response of these 14 patients, platinum-based combination therapy with low-dose cisplatin and paclitaxel administered in a DD interval can lead to the development of
antitumor cytotoxic T-cell immune response in patients with

126

platinum-resistant disease. We hope the encouraging results
would facilitate the examination of DD regimen with low-dose
drugs in a larger patient group.

Discussion
Phase I trials of new chemotherapeutic drugs typically
focus on the identiﬁcation of the MTD due to the assumption that it leads to the greatest antitumor cytotoxicity and
effectiveness. Consequently, studies have neglected to investigate the possible advantages of low-dose chemotherapy.
The data of the present study strongly imply that DD
administration of low-dose platinum agent and paclitaxel
spares the immune system from major toxicity and modiﬁes
the tumor microenvironment in favor of immunogenic
tumor cell death, which results in the generation of antitumor immunity. This treatment modality leads to tumor
macrophage recruitment, production of tumor-speciﬁc
CD8þ T cells, and the selective reduction of immunosuppressive MDSCs and Treg cells of the tumor microenvironment. These immunologic changes are associated with the
therapeutic response in tumor-bearing mice. It has been
theorized that the combined effort of chemotherapy and
host immunity results in the best management of persistent
malignancies (20). The probability for success may depend
on whether or not the drug-induced tumor cell death
triggers the mechanisms that promote the development of
tumor-speciﬁc immune response (21, 22).
The drug-induced immunogenic apoptosis of human ovarian
cancer cells produce unique signals that promote dendritic cell
maturation, enhance cross-presentation of tumor antigens, and
enable T-cell priming that lead to tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ activity
(23). At Mackay Memorial Hospital, DD chemotherapy with
weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel has been a salvage option for
relapse of ovarian cancer with platinum resistance. Because we
would expect the activation of CD8þ T cells to accompany
IFN-g and IL-2 elevation, we tested and conﬁrmed higher
serum levels of these cytokines in 3 of 4 patients whose disease
was controlled. While the statistical power of the patient
study is challenged by the small sample size, the results are
promising enough that the regimen should be investigated in
a larger clinical study. We believe that disease control in
patients is related to the antitumor immunity that is produced
as a consequence of DD treatment. The results of the present
study suggest that antitumor effect of DD regimen is potentiated by tumor-speciﬁc immune response, and ergo, is more
effective against drug-resistant disease. Furthermore, the gentler nature of low-dose dose dense regimen makes it ideal for
maintenance therapy following the initial marrow-depriving
MTD treatment.
