Abstract
In cancer tests with 1,3-butadiene (BD), the mouse is much
more sensitive than the rat. This is considered to be related to
the metabolism of BD to the epoxide metabolites, 1,2-epoxy3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, and 1,2-epoxy-3,4butanediol. This study evaluates whether the large difference
in outcome in cancer tests with BD could be predicted
quantitatively on the basis of the concentration over time in
blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, their mutagenic
potency, and a multiplicative cancer risk model, which has
earlier been used for ionizing radiation. Published data on
hemoglobin adduct levels from inhalation experiments with
BD were used for the estimation of the AUC of the epoxide
metabolites in the cancer tests. The estimated AUC of the
epoxides were then weighed together to a total genotoxic dose,
by using the relative genotoxic potency of the respective
epoxide inferred from in vitro hprt mutation assays using EB
as standard. The tumor incidences predicted with the risk
model on the basis of the total genotoxic dose correlated well
with the earlier observed tumor incidences in the cancer tests.
The total genotoxic dose that leads to a doubling of the tumor
incidences was estimated to be the same in both species, 9 to
10 mmol/Lh EB-equivalents. The study validates the applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic
chemicals. Furthermore, according to this evaluation, different epoxide metabolites are predominating cancer-initiating
agents in the cancer tests with BD, the diepoxide in the
mouse, and the monoepoxides in the rat. [Cancer Res

Introduction
1,3-Butadiene (BD) is extensively used in polymer production
and is also formed in incomplete combustion of organic matter and
is found in, e.g., car exhaust and tobacco smoke (1, 2).
Epidemiologic studies have shown an increased leukemia incidence
in workers exposed to BD, which underlie the classification of BD
by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and IARC as
a ‘‘human carcinogen’’ (2).3 However, the cancer risk assessment of
BD has been encumbered with large uncertainties. The cancer tests
in the mouse and the rat with exposures to BD through inhalation
showed a large difference in sensitivity to BD between the two
species, the mouse being the more sensitive (3–5). Genotoxicity of
BD has been comprehensively reviewed (e.g., in refs. 2, 6, 7), and it

is clear that BD induces genotoxic effects in several test systems
primarily through its reactive epoxide metabolites 1,2-epoxy3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), and 1,2-epoxy-3,
4-butanediol (EBdiol). DEB has been shown (in vitro) to be a
much more potent inducer of mutations than EB and EBdiol (8, 9).
The interspecies difference in the sensitivity to BD in the cancer
tests points, on the basis of the genotoxicity tests, toward
differences in the internal dose of DEB, due to differences in the
rates of formation and detoxification of DEB.
A dose concept for genotoxic electrophiles has been developed
where the dose is defined as the concentration over time (area
under the concentration curve, AUC; ref. 10). The dose in blood of a
reactive metabolite could be calculated from levels of specific
adducts to blood proteins (11). Methods for measurement of
adducts from EB, DEB, and EBdiol to NH2-terminal valines in
hemoglobin (Hb) have been developed, and data useful for
calculations of dose in blood of the epoxide metabolites in BDexposed mice and rats have been published.
The main objective of this study is to evaluate whether the
difference in outcome in cancer tests with BD between the mouse
and the rat could be predicted quantitatively on the basis of the
doses in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, EB, DEB, and
EBdiol, and their respective relative mutagenic potency. The AUC
in the cancer tests are inferred from published (12) Hb adduct
levels measured in short-term inhalation studies with BD in rats
and mice. To correlate the response in cancer tests to the total
genotoxic dose of the epoxides in blood, the relative genotoxic
potency ( from in vitro data) of the respective epoxide has to be
considered. The cancer test data are then evaluated on the basis of
the total genotoxic dose with the application of a multiplicative
cancer risk model.
The multiplicative risk model gives an estimate of the doubling
dose (DD) of the causative genotoxic agents, this is the dose that is
required to induce a doubling of the tumor frequency. The risk
model assumes that the slope of the dose-response is proportional
to the background risk, and that the excess relative risk is common
for the different responding sites. In addition, it is indicated that
the relative risk increment according to this model is approximately independent on species and sex (13). This model has been
shown to provide a way of predicting the tumor incidence in long
term animal tests with ionizing radiation and also in cancer tests
with ethylene oxide and acrylamide (13, 14). The model has been
shown to predict the tumor incidence among A-bomb survivors,
and the life-time excess relative risk estimates for different solid
cancer sites were approximately the same (15, 16). It should be
noted that to be able to apply the model to genotoxic agents and

perform interspecies extrapolation, it is a prerequisite to measure
the lifetime internal doses (AUC) of the causative agents.
The evaluation of the cancer test data for BD is a challenge
because of the large species difference in sensitivity to BD, and
because all three epoxide metabolites are genotoxic and could
contribute to the initiation of tumors. This study show the
applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to the data for
BD and support the usefulness of the suggested methodology.

Materials and Methods
Long-term inhalation exposures to BD in cancer tests. Data from two
long-term cancer tests with inhalation of BD in Sprague-Dawley rats and
B6C3F1 mice are considered for the evaluation in this study (5, 17). The
animals were treated for 6 h per day, 5 d per week in f2 y. Duration of
exposures in the different cancer tests were: 3,090 h ( female and male
mouse), 3,150 h ( female rat), and 3,330 h (male rat). Groups of 50 mice were
exposed to 0, 6.25, 20, 62.5, 200, or 625 ppm, and groups of 100 rats were
exposed to 0, 1,000, or 8,000 ppm. All exposure doses and all tissues showing
a significant response in the cancer tests, as reported in the review of US
EPA (2), were used in the evaluation. Table 1 summarizes the target organs
and types of neoplastic lesions analyzed.
Short-term inhalation exposure to BD. Published data from short-term
inhalation exposures to BD in mice and rats were used for the calculation of
doses in blood (AUC) in the cancer tests. From the Hb adduct levels from EB,
DEB, and EBdiol measured by Boysen and colleagues (12), we calculated the
AUC of the respective epoxide per exposure dose of BD. These data were then
used for the calculation of the lifetime doses in blood of the epoxides in the
2-y cancer tests with BD (2). In the short-term studies, Hb adduct levels have
been measured in female B6C3F1 mice exposed to 3, 62.5, or 1,250 ppm for
2 wk (5 d per week, 6 h per day). Furthermore, Hb-adduct data from female
F344 rats exposed to 3 or 62.5 ppm for 2 weeks are available. Data from female
and male Crl:CD rats (Sprague-Dawley) exposed to 1,000 ppm of BD for 13 wk
(12, 18) were also included in the present study.
Dose in blood inferred from levels of Hb adducts. The dose (D) of a
genotoxic agent is defined as the concentration (C) over time often called
the AUC [in (mol  L1  h) = (M  h)] as shown in Eq. 1 (10).

For the monoepoxy metabolites, EB and EBdiol, adducts with Ntermini in Hb were measured as N-(2-monohydroxybutenyl)valine (EBVal) and N-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutenyl)valine (EBdiol-Val), respectively. These
Hb adducts were measured after detachment as fluorinated derivatives
according to the modified Edman method by gas chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (19, 20). DEB forms a ring-closed adduct, a
pyrrolidine, in the reaction with NH2-terminal valine in Hb [N,N-(2,3dihydroxy-1,4-butadiyl)valine, called DEB-Val; refs. 21–23]. The DEB-Val
adduct levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry after enzymatic degradation of Hb and enrichment of the
DEB-modified NH2-terminal a-heptapeptide by immunoaffinity chromatography. For further information on the analytic conditions, see Boysen
and colleagues (12). With this method, only the adduct with the a-chain
is measured. The reported DEB-Val adduct level is expressed in per gram
globin (12). By multiplying the measured DEB-Val adduct level with a
factor of 2, the adduct level is here expressed per g a-chain (assuming
50% of the globin weight is a-chain).
The different kval (Lg1h1) for the epoxide metabolites of BD are
earlier determined to be as follows: for the mouse, EB 2.9105 (24), DEB
4.7105 (21), and EBdiol 2.1105 (21); and for the rat, EB 4.0105 (25),
DEB 5.5105 (21), and EBdiol 2.3105 (21). The kval of DEB refers to the
reaction rate with the a-chain N-termini only (21).
For the calculation of the AUC, the published Hb adduct levels of the
three epoxide metabolites have been adjusted with regard to the duration of
exposure and the disappearance of Hb adducts due to the life span of
erythrocytes (ter ; ref. 26). For the strains used in the cancer tests, the ter is

respectively (Table 2). The hprt loci was chosen because the availability of in
vivo data for possible comparison. The absolute values of the treatment
doses of the epoxides are encumbered with uncertainties; however, the
comparison of the mutagenic potency per AUC gives a better estimate than
the conventional approach using comparison of mutagenic potency per
initial treatment concentration.
The relative genotoxic potency could then be used to convert the AUC of
EB, DEB, and EBdiol to a total genotoxic dose by multiplying the dose D
(AUC) of the respective epoxide with the corresponding mutagenic potency
(1:32:0.21; Eq. 3; Table 3). This is expressed as EB dose-equivalents (mmol/L
 h) per exposure dose of BD (ppm  h).

EB dose-equivalents in cancer tests. The total genotoxic doses
from the epoxide metabolites of BD in the cancer tests with mice and
rats were calculated on the basis of EB-equivalent dose from the inhalation
exposures (Table 3). For the rat cancer test, the total genotoxic dose was
inferred from EB-equivalent dose in both sexes at the exposure level of
1,000 ppm. No Hb-adduct measurements are available above 1,000 ppm in
the rat. The highest exposure at 8,000 ppm in the rat cancer test will
therefore be discussed separately, see ‘‘High exposure levels’’ in the
Discussion section.
The total genotoxic doses in the mouse cancer test were estimated from
the EB-equivalent doses in blood obtained at the exposure levels of 3, 62.5,
and 1,250 ppm. Different scenarios were applied for the calculation of the
AUC at the exposure levels in the cancer test (6.25, 20, 62.5, and 200 ppm; 625
ppm excluded due to high mortality). The primary scenario assumes a linear
increase up to 6.25 ppm from the measurement at 3 ppm. The estimate for 20
ppm was then obtained by linear extrapolation between the predicted value
at 6.25 ppm and the observed value at 62.5 ppm. The alternative AUC for 6.25
and 20 ppm were based on direct interpolation between the measurements
at 3 and 62.5 ppm. These two scenarios are illustrated in Fig. 2 as
EB-equivalent doses. Two scenarios were also applied for estimating the
EB-equivalent dose at the highest exposure level at 200 ppm. This will be
further discussed below (see ‘‘High exposure levels’’ in the Discussion).
Cancer risk model. The model known as the excess relative risk model
(or multiplicative model), often applied in radiation research, was fitted to
the tumor incidence data. This model implies that the fraction of animals
with tumors in target tissue i, i.e., Pi (D), can be described by the following
function:
Pi ðDÞ ¼ 1  ePi ð1þbDÞ

f40 d in the mouse and f60 d in the rat (27, 28). The correction factors
(considering ter and duration of exposure) used are in the range 1.1 to 3.0.
The adjusted levels of Hb adducts at the different exposures are
summarized in Fig. 1.
Calculations of dose equivalents. The evaluation of the cancer tests of
BD according to the multiplicative model was based on the AUC of the
genotoxic epoxide metabolites EB, DEB, and EBdiol at the different levels of
exposures. Furthermore, the differences in the mutagenic potency of the
epoxides were considered to calculate a total genotoxic dose.
In a study using human TK6 cells, it was shown that EB, DEB, and
EBdiol were effective at inducing mutations in both the hprt and tk loci
(8). The initial treatment concentrations leading to f2-fold increases in
mutant frequency are listed in Table 2. The rates of disappearance of the
epoxides in the medium during treatment will have an influence on AUC
of the epoxides (see Eq. 1). AUC was estimated through approximation of
the disappearance during the treatment (24 h) with rates of hydrolysis
(see Eq. 1; Table 2). Using EB as reference, the relative mutagenic potency
per AUC was then estimated with regard to the efficiency of inducing
mutation in the hprt loci; it was 1:32:0.21 of EB, DEB, and EBdiol,

D denotes the dose (AUC) in target tissues of the genotoxic agent. In the
present evaluation of cancer tests with BD, the dose denotes the total dose
in blood of cancer-initiating agents (expressed as EB dose-equivalents). For
specific organs, the dose in blood has to be related to the target dose (see
below).
Pi0 represents the cumulative hazard for tumor formation in the target
tissue i among unexposed animals, and b is the common relative excess
risk per unit of dose. We express the relative potency as the DD, which is the
same as 1/b, that is the dose yielding a cumulative hazard of 2Pi0. When we

The variables of these nonlinear functions were estimated by binomial

blood had to be obtained from later, similar short-term exposure
experiments with mice and rats. Assuming that the metabolic rates
are about the same irrespectively if the exposure continues for 2,
13, or f100 weeks, the published Hb adduct measurements from
inhalation experiments with BD were used for estimation of doses
in blood of the epoxides of BD over the lifetime in the cancer tests.
These were then used to calculate the total genotoxic dose,
expressed as EB-equivalent dose, considering the genotoxic
potency of the individual epoxide metabolites.
Results from the Hb adduct measurements of EB, DEB, or EBdiol
in the mouse and the rat in exposure studies with BD have earlier
been compared and used for evaluation of the species differences
in intermediate steps in the metabolism of BD (29). The data on
adduct levels of EB-Val and EBdiol-Val in Hb from mice and rats in
the study of Boysen and colleagues (12) were in agreement with the
earlier studies in rodents on Hb-adduct levels after treatment with
BD (20, 25, 30). The study of Boysen and colleagues (12), however, is
the first to report data on DEB-Val adduct levels after treatment
with BD, and the Hb-adduct data from this study was therefore
used for the calculations in the present study.
A comparison between the two species of the observed Hbadduct levels after 2 weeks of exposure, without the adjustments

for the disappearance rate of Hb adducts, gives qualitatively similar
result as the comparison with regard to the AUC as calculated in
the present study (see below). However, the AUC of the epoxides
inferred from the adducts levels are necessary for an accurate
quantitative comparison between species and allow the calculation
of total genotoxic doses, as EB dose-equivalents.
Calculated AUC of epoxide metabolites in short-term
inhalation exposures with BD. Generally, the AUC of the epoxide
metabolites increased with exposure in both the mouse and the rat.
For all three epoxides, the highest AUC per exposure dose were
observed at 3 ppm (Table 3). This indicates a more effective
metabolism to epoxides at low exposure levels. The AUC of EBdiol
increased with exposure dose, however, not linearly, probably due
to saturation of metabolizing enzymes. This has also been observed
through measurements of Hb adducts in earlier studies with
exposure to BD or to its epoxide metabolites (20, 30), and recently
through measurement of steady-state concentrations of epoxide
metabolites in blood after a single exposure to BD (31). A
predominant difference between the mouse and the rat was
observed with regard to the AUC of DEB, which at 3 ppm already
was high in the mouse, and f16 times lower in the rat. The lower
AUC of DEB per exposure dose at 62.5 ppm in the rat indicates an

almost saturated metabolism. This is a major cause of the
difference in the calculated EB dose-equivalent for the two species.
Calculated AUC in the mouse and the rat in the cancer tests.
The exposure levels in the cancer tests considered were as follows:
the mouse, 0 to 62.5 ppm; the rat, 0 to 1,000 ppm. At the high
exposure levels (200 and 625 ppm in the mouse and 8,000 ppm in
the rat), saturation of the metabolism and also toxic effects are
more pronounced. This is further discussed below (see ‘‘High
exposure levels’’ in the Discussion). The total genotoxic dose (EBequivalents) in the mouse increases with the BD exposure levels 0 to
62.5 ppm (Fig. 2). The EB-equivalent dose in the cancer test
with rats exposed to 1,000 ppm was estimated to 12.2 mmol/L  h
in females and to 6.8 mmol/L  h in males.

Cancer risk estimates for target sites. To estimate a common
risk coefficient, b, for all tumor sites on the basis of dose in
blood, it is a necessity that the cancer causative agent(s) is (are)
evenly distributed in the different organs. Measurements of the
concentrations of EB and DEB in mice and rats after a 4-hour
exposure to 62.5 ppm BD in earlier studies have shown that the
concentration of the respective epoxide is similar in all vessel-rich
organs (32). These results are strengthened by reports on the DNA
adducts from EB and EBdiol, showing that approximately the
same level of the respective adduct was present in all tissues
examined (33, 34). However, the concentrations of the epoxide
metabolites in organs were found to be one half of the concentration in blood (32). This has earlier also been shown for the
chemically related compound ethylene oxide through the
comparison of Hb- and DNA-adduct levels (35). This supports
that the DD, estimated from the dose in blood, should be reduced
by 50% to give an appropriate estimate of the dose in target
tissues in the cancer tests with BD (13, 36).
High exposure levels. In the primary analyses of the published
cancer test data, the exposure level 8,000 ppm for the rat and 200
and 625 ppm for the mouse were not included because the
dosimetry data were uncertain. Furthermore, the survival was
heavily affected at 625 ppm in the mouse where f90% of the
animals were dead already after 60 days and these data were
therefore not considered.
When including the highest exposure level, 8,000 ppm, for the
rat, and assuming a proportional increase of the AUC of the
epoxides from 1,000 ppm, a highly significant quadratic dose

DD in Cancer Tests
The relative excess risk per unit of dose (b in Eq. 4 and 5) may be
expressed as DD = 1/b common for all tumor sites. In this study,
the dose in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites is considered as
a basis for the DD. The DD was estimated as the lifetime EB doseequivalent (mmol/L  h) for all sites (Table 4).
In female mice, the DD of the EB-equivalent dose was estimated to
10.0 and 8.5 mmol/L  h in the two scenarios of AUC (Fig. 2; Table 4).
If the dosimetry for female mouse was applied also to the cancer
test of male mouse, for which no dosimetry data are available, a
similar DD was obtained (17.9 mmol/L  h). For rats ( female and
male) the common DD was 8.9 mmol/L  h. The multiplicative model
based on doses in blood yields an adequate fit for the cancer test
data with a good prediction of observed number of tumors (Fig. 3).
The DD is thus very similar, f9 mmol/L  h, irrespectively of
species or sex according to this evaluation (Fig. 3; Table 4).
Quantitative differences in metabolism between the two species
(Table 3) results in that DEB is the major contributor (close to 90%)
to the total genotoxic dose in the mouse, whereas in the rat, DEB
represents only a minor fraction (5–10%) of the total genotoxic
dose (Eq. 3; Table 3). Therefore, it may be concluded that DEB is the

component (P < 0.001) was needed to provide an adequate fit. A
secondary scenario assuming complete saturation, i.e., the AUC of
the epoxides at 8,000 ppm is the same as at 1,000 ppm, was tested.
This is supported by measurements of epoxide metabolite
concentration after single exposures to BD, which showed that
formation of DEB and EBdiol will be saturated (31, 37) and that
only the EB concentration will continue to increase at exposure
above 1,000 ppm (37). With this assumption, a linear dose-response
model provided an adequate fit and the DD estimate of EBequivalents [DD = 7.2 (4.5–12.5) mmol/L  h] was essentially
unchanged compared with the analysis restricted to 1,000 ppm.
When including the cancer data at 200 ppm in mice, we
considered two scenarios to estimate the AUC at this exposure
level: either applying linear interpolation (between 62.5 and 1,200
ppm), or assuming proportionality to the AUC at 62.5 ppm. In both
cases, a linear model yielded an estimated DD of f15 mmol/L  h.
However, when testing curvature of the dose-response, a negative
quadratic dose-term was found, which is most probably due to an
increased fraction of animals dying at 200 ppm before developing
tumors. In the first case, this term was not statistically significant
and, in the second case, it was (P < 0.05).
Cancer risk model. The risk model used implies that the risk
increment per unit dose of the genotoxic agent in different
responding tissues is proportional to the background incidence in
the respective tissue. The interpretation is thus that the
background promotive conditions determine the spectrum of
spontaneous tumors as well as tumors induced by an exogenous
genotoxic agent. At very high doses of exposure in cancer tests, the
exposure might influence the promoting conditions, which should
be reflected in the quadratic term in the risk model (Eq. 5). This is
described more in detail in refs. 13, 38.
This is a rather crude, mechanism-based model for cancer risk
assessment of genotoxic agents, which is manageable and
straightforward when dosimetry data are available. The model
seems not to be suitable for assessment of nongenotoxic
carcinogens, which are likely to be tissue specific and probably
also much more species specific. However, if certain tissues show
deviations from the multiplicative model, it may indicate that the
substance has other modes of action than genotoxic.
There are potential biases in our estimated DDs. The inclusion
of all sites showing a significant increase in tumor incidence after
exposure may lead to an overestimation of the relative potency
because strong responses due to chance may be overrepresented.
This problem would be particularly pronounced in the case of
studies with low statistical power, which can be due to small
sample sizes, low potency of the chemical tested and/or inadequate
dosing. The second source of bias is related to the fact that the
exposure decreases the overall survival. Because we used the crude

www.aacrjournals.org

tumor rates in our analyses the excess mortality due to early onset
of lethal tumors or death due to toxicity may be a competing risk,
leading to an underestimation of the risk. However, exposure levels
up to 62.5 ppm for the mouse and 1,000 ppm for the rat did not
substantially effect the overall survival.
Relative genotoxic potency. In the present study, the relative
in vitro mutagenic potencies of the three epoxide metabolites of
BD were used to calculate the EB-equivalent doses from the doses
in blood of the epoxides. The EB-equivalent doses were then used
as a measure of the total genotoxic doses in the cancer tests
(see ‘‘Calculations of dose equivalents’’ above). The reliability of
the estimated relative genotoxic potencies is supported by earlier
results from a similar study with ethylene oxide. Approximately the
same DD in blood (f11 mmol/L  h) was observed for ethylene
oxide in cancer tests with the mouse and the rat, as was obtained
for the EB-equivalent (f9 mmol/L  h) in this study (13). In vitro
mutation data support that the genotoxic potency (per AUC) of an
EB-equivalent and of ethylene oxide is about the same (8, 39, 40).
This means that we expect approximately the same DD for
ethylene oxide and the EB-equivalent.
There are some in vivo mutation data with parallel Hb adduct
measurement for the BD epoxide metabolites, but the data are not
sufficient for estimating the in vivo relative genotoxic potency.
However, the observed mutation frequency of BD and 3-butene-1,2diol (precursor of EBdiol) in vivo (41, 42) is by and large in agreement
with the one estimated (data not shown) from AUC of the epoxides
and in vitro relative genotoxic potency obtained in the present study.
Comparison with epidemiologic studies. Workers exposed to
high concentrations of BD have shown an increased mortality in
leukemia (reviewed in ref. 2). However, the most comprehensive
studies of low BD exposure were negative with regard to HPRT gene
mutation and cytogenetic response, although measured Hb adduct
levels showed a significant increase with exposure (43, 44). In these
studies, neither the mutational nor the cytogenetic responses showed
any association with genotypes. There are, however, other studies in
humans showing a significant difference in levels of mutations and
cytogenetic effects related to BD exposures (e.g., refs. 45, 46).
The large species difference in sensitivity to BD observed in the
rodent cancer tests are according to the evaluation due to a
difference in the metabolism to DEB. In vitro metabolism data and
Hb adduct levels indicate that humans generate low doses of DEB
and, as for rat, high exposure levels are most probably required to
reach a sufficient in vivo dose of the epoxides to cause a detectable
genotoxic/carcinogenic response. A causal relationship between
leukemia and high cumulative exposure and high intensity of
exposure to BD is supported by a study using an excess relative risk
model, similar to the model used in the present evaluation (47).
The DD estimated from the linear regression was 595 ppm-year.

Cancer Research

When corrections for peak exposures were performed, the DD
was estimated to f5,300 ppm-year. The DD observed in the rat
in the present evaluation (8.9 mmol/L  h EB-equivalent; Table 4)
corresponds to f1,400 ppm-year (700 ppm for 2 years).
An uncertainty with regard to the extrapolation to humans from
toxicologic data in general concerns the dose-response relationship
at very low doses. AUC measurement in blood, e.g., by Hb adduct
measurements, bypass the problems of species- and high-to-low
dose differences in metabolism of reactive compounds/intermediates. Deviations from linearity in dose-response due to DNA repair,
etc., at very low exposure levels could exist for certain compounds
(48). These are, however, not detected with the sensitivity in the
standard test systems. The comparison above of data for the rat
with the epidemiologic data from occupational exposure to BD
indicates no obvious disagreement in estimated risks.

we also have some potential sources of bias, the apparently very
large difference in carcinogenic potency of BD between the species
can be quantitatively explained by the suggested approach.
Furthermore, it is notable that different metabolites of BD are
found to be the cancer causative agents in mice and rats, which
underline a weakness of cancer tests as a basis for risk estimation
and extrapolation of risks to humans.
Comparisons of mutagenic potencies (in vitro and in vivo)
together with internal dose measurement of the potential causative
carcinogenic agent(s) would, in the opinion of the authors, reduce
the need for long term cancer tests of genotoxic agents. In
conclusion, the results from the present study further validate the
applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic
chemicals as an improved basis for cancer risk estimation.

Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest
Conclusion

No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

Published cancer tests with BD in mice and rats have been
evaluated with regard to the applicability of a multiplicative
(relative) risk model to the tumor frequency data and on the basis
of total genotoxic doses in blood. The good fit of the data to the
multiplicative model shows that the dose-response is proportional
to the background risk, i.e., the background variations in promotive
conditions in the different tissues influence the outcome in tumor
development. According to this evaluation, the relative risk
coefficient obtained is approximately independent of species, sex,
and tumor site. Although the data from rats is relatively weak and
