ABSTRACT
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is one of the most lethal breast cancer variants;
with existing therapy, 5-yr survival rate is only 35%. Current barriers to successful
treatment of IBC include frequent infiltration and the presence of tumor cell clusters,
termed tumor emboli, within the breast parenchyma and lymphatics. Prior studies
have identified the role of anti-apoptotic signaling, in particular hyperactivation
of NFκB and its target genes, in IBC pathobiology and therapeutic resistance. The
objectives of this study were to: (1) determine if IBC tumor emboli express antiapoptotic proteins and (2) develop a high content, multiparametric assay to assess
the morphology of the IBC 3D spheroids and to optimize a high throughput format
to screen for compounds that can inhibit the formation of the IBC tumor clusters/
embolic structures. Immunohistochemical analysis of IBC patient tumor samples with
documented tumor emboli revealed high NFκB (p65) staining along with expression
of XIAP, a potent anti-apoptotic protein known to interact with NFκB signaling in
enhancing survival of malignant cells. Subsequently, the high content assay developed
allowed for simultaneous imaging and morphometric analysis, including count
and viability of spheroids derived from SUM149, rSUM149 and SUM190 cells and
its application to evaluate XIAP and NFκB inhibitory agents. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the off-patent drug disulfiram when chelated with copper, which we had
previously reported to inhibit NFκB signaling, was highly effective in disrupting both
IBC spheroids and emboli grown in vitro. Taken together, these results identify a highthroughput approach to target tumor spheroid formation for drug discovery. Finally,

signaling mediated by epidermal growth factor (EGFR/
HER2) and downstream protein kinase (MAPK or AKT)
signaling. This process was successful in basal-type and
HER2-overexpressing IBC cells [13, 15]. A comprehensive
expression analysis of the surviving cell isolates with
elevated XIAP led to the identification of an adaptive stress
response signature/metagene dominated by anti-apoptotic,
antioxidant, and cell survival activity [16–18]. We then
applied this metagene to the World IBC Consortium tumor
samples [6] and identified that untreated tumor samples
from IBC patients compared to non-IBC and normal
breast samples have a heightened expression of this NFκB
pathway enriched signature [19, 20]. Although prior such
studies [7, 20–22] reveal that IBC tumors express gene
profiles that promote a hyperproliferative phenotype, they
lack information of the expression pattern in the tumor
cells and in particular if anti-apoptotic factors like NFκB
contribute to tumor emboli formation. However, due to the
diffuse nature of the disease, it is very difficult to obtain
tissue with adequate numbers of dermal tumor emboli for
detailed analyses. An alternative would be to grow tumor
spheroids and emboli in vitro, using IBC cell lines. Tumor
spheroids in culture generated from various cancer cell
lines including breast, ovarian, liver, and colon cancer
are widely used as 3D models grown in non-adherent
conditions [23–25]. In this study, we optimized a high
content multiparametric assay to simultaneously image and
quantitatively measure multiple cell health characteristics
of 3D IBC tumor spheroids. This method was then applied
to characterize the efficacy of various candidate anti-cancer
compounds that target the XIAP:NFκB survival pathway.
The study found that an FDA-approved drug used over
fifty years for chronic alcoholism, disulfiram (DSF),
when chelated with copper suppressed IBC tumor emboli
formation. Furthermore, NFκB and XIAP expression
were observed to be significantly higher in tumor embolic
structures in IBC patient tumor tissue. These results
revealed the potential of using the NFκB inhibitor, DSF in
combination with copper for treatment of IBC.

INTRODUCTION
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is considered
the most lethal form of locally advanced breast cancer
and although categorized as a rare disease, IBC accounts
for more than 15% of breast cancer related deaths [1, 2].
IBC is a designated health disparity due to its increased
incidence and mortality amongst minority populations
both in the US and globally. With improved awareness, its
detection has increased, especially in large clinical centers
[3]. The majority of patients at the time of diagnosis are
already in advanced Stage III or higher with lymph node
involvement; 30% have distant metastases at the time of
diagnosis [4, 5]. Although patients receive aggressive
multidisciplinary treatments including anthracycline/
taxane-based neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, targeted
drugs, radical surgery, and adjuvant radiotherapy, nearly
50% of patients die of metastatic disease. It is therefore
clear that IBC tumor cells develop mechanisms to evade
therapeutic apoptosis leading to cancer recurrence. It has
been challenging to identify molecular mechanisms that
drive tumor aggression in patients with IBC. For example,
all molecular subtypes associated with breast cancer are
present in IBC [6]. Second, prognostic differences related
to chromosomal alterations in IBC are also not significantly
different from other advanced breast cancers [7].
Interestingly, the most distinct histopathological
feature associated with all IBC patients is the presence
of tightly packed tumor cell clusters (also termed tumor
emboli) in the dermis tumor parenchyma, lymphatic
vessels, and other metastatic sites [8]. Unlike other breast
cancers, there is usually no solid mass or lump that can be
felt during a breast exam or imaged on a mammogram.
During metastatic progression, the tumor cell clusters appear
to spread and block the lymph vessels in the skin of the
breast, causing redness, swelling, and pain. The symptoms
mimic inflammation (hence the name) and can often lead
to misdiagnosis of an infection. Interestingly, unlike nonIBC tumors wherein epithelial markers are lost as part of the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), leading to single
cell invasion and dissemination through blood vessels, IBC
tumor cells seem to retain epithelial markers. These include
high E-cadherin expression, while also gaining mesenchymal
and stem-like (aldehyde dehydrogenase [ALDH]-positivity)
characteristics [9, 10]. These observations indicate IBC cells
exhibit a high degree of cellular plasticity that is postulated
to protect IBC tumor clusters/emboli from cell death/stress
stimuli during cancer progression and metastasis [11].
We were the first to discover high expression of the
most potent anti-apoptotic protein, XIAP, in IBC preclinical
models [12–14]. To identify this resistance mechanism we
isolated and clonally expanded tumor cell isolates that
gained the ability to grow despite inhibition of oncogenic

breast cancer subtype (Figure 1A). Representative H&E
staining shows the presence of tumor emboli in the tumor
tissue (Figure 1A, bottom panel). To address if high
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins contributes to the
aggressive phenotype in IBC, we evaluated the expression
of XIAP and NFκB, key pro-survival factors, in tumor
emboli present in untreated IBC patient tumor samples
made available through the World IBC Consortium from
a total of 14 samples with documented tumor emboli as
described in methods. Immunohistochemical analysis

of the tumor sections revealed significant expression of
NFκB (p65 subunit) in all the identified tumor embolic
structures and XIAP expression in 8/14 samples with
ranging degree of staining (Figure 1B). Therefore,
these results identifying expression of NFκB and XIAP
proteins that are known to crosstalk and regulate antiapoptotic signaling in cancer cells suggest the potential
of targeting these survival proteins for inhibiting tumor
clusters/emboli formation, postulated to be one of the first
steps in IBC progression and metastatic dissemination.

Development and optimization of a high content,

changes in size and number of resultant IBC cell clusters/
spheroids over time across multiple wells (Figure 2B).
This offers the advantages of simultaneously providing
qualitative images, numeric measures of cell health
characteristics and growth kinetics of intact tumor cell
clusters/spheroids, which can also be grown in multi-well
plates for high throughput screening. Data in Figure 2C
is a representative view of a field with multiple spheroids
while Figure 2D shows a representative single spheroid
(untreated, healthy [upper], and treated with a cytotoxic
agent [lower]). In general, using the Hoechst signal we
included spheroids of > 50 μm diameter as sizes smaller
may reflect cell aggregates (Figure 2B- orange spheroid
masks were excluded while blue masks indicate included
spheroids). The masking also facilitates determination of
various characteristics of the multicellular tumor spheroids
(Table 1) as well as establishing the regions of interest
for quantitation of YOYO-1 (area inside nuclear mask;
channel 2 mean average intensity) and MitoTracker Red
FM staining.
The IBC spheroid formation was then assessed for
varying seeding densities over multiple days in culture

In order to study if targeting the anti-apoptotic
proteins can inhibit the ability of IBC cells to form tumor
cell clusters and subsequent viability, we employed IBC
patient primary tumor derived lines, SUM149 (triple
negative, EGFR activation) and SUM190 (estrogen
receptor negative, HER2 overexpression). These cells
have the ability to spontaneously form 3D tumor
spheroids when seeded in ultra-low attachment plates
similar to previous studies [19, 27, 30]. Representative
images of SUM149 tumor spheroids are shown in in
Figure 2A. We then applied a high content “Cell Health
Profiling” assay to the IBC tumor spheroids by using
three dyes, Hoechst 33342 (to measure spheroid count and
morphology), YOYO-1 (infiltrates cells with compromised
membranes and quantifies viability) and MitoTracker
Red FM (determines mitochondrial membrane potential).
This strategy allowed us to image the formation and

(Figure 3). An increase in spheroid size is observed with
increasing cell seeding density (Figure 3A), with no
significant change in total number of spheroids (Figure
3B). Average YOYO-1 intensity is variable until seeding
densities ≥ 2500 cells/well, when the spheroids approach
their maximum size and the YOYO-1 signal is stable and
low, suggesting healthy mature spheroids (Figure 3B –
top). Overall, these measurements were used to optimize
seeding densities for different plate sizes as described in
Materials and Methods. Representative images are shown
in Figure 3C highlighting individual spheroid staining and
a merged overlay of all dyes staining the tumor spheroids
at days 3 and 6 in a 6-well plate. We observed uniform
Hoechst and MitoTracker staining within the tumor cells
in the untreated 3D spheroids, although the periphery of
some spheroids stained more intensely with MitoTracker.
In addition, the untreated spheroids had minimal YOYO-1
staining and therefore reflect the formation of viable tumor
spheroids in this assay. The acquired images at the early
(day 3) and later time points (day 6) were used to derive
multiparametric phenotypic and viability quantitative
measures, which are summarized in Table 1 and Figure
3D. Spheroid area increased over time saturating in size
after day 7, with no change in spheroid number after
day 3. Certain parameters in this assay were normalized
by determining mean staining per object to account for
differences in spheroid size (YOYO-1, MitoTracker Red).
It is to be noted that the numerical values associated with
measurements of spheroid morphology or mitochondrial
transmembrane potential can show increases or decreases

in signal relative to untreated spheroids, both of which
can be indicative of compromised cell health or spheroid
integrity [31].
Next, we tested the spheroid-forming ability
of the drug resistant variant rSUM149 that has been
previously shown to correlate with high endogenous
XIAP and NFκB expression and decreased sensitivity
to therapeutic apoptosis [13, 18]. The rSUM149 cells
also formed tumor spheroids within 24-48h in nonadherent culture conditions. Quantitative analysis of the
multicellular spheroid morphology (area, shape, texture),
YOYO-1 intensity (cell viability within the spheroids)
and MitoTracker Red staining (mitochondrial membrane
potential of the cells within the tumor spheroids) after 3
days of growth is summarized in Figure 3E. Although
there was some variation in rate of spheroid formation
between the parental and drug resistant lines (data not
shown), there were no statistical difference observed in the
spheroid area, morphological parameters or mitochondrial
membrane potential between SUM149 and rSUM149
cells. These results reveal the potential of using these cell
lines in parallel for drug screening studies of spheroids
formed from both therapy-sensitive and -resistant isotypematched variants.

tumor embolic structures, we wanted to test if targeting the
XIAP-NFκB anti-apoptotic signaling pathway can inhibit
formation of tumor cell clusters and/or induce cell death
using the high content IBC 3D spheroid assay developed
herein. To provide proof of principle, we evaluated known
XIAP and NFκB pharmacological inhibitors, which in our
prior studies have also shown their efficacy in SUM149,
rSUM149 and SUM190 IBC cell lines grown in 2D cultures.
These included embelin (a plant derived non-peptidomimetic
that targets XIAP’s ability to inhibit caspase 9 and inhibits
NFκB activity) [17], JSH23 (inhibits nuclear localization of
NFκB) [18], and GANT61, a hedgehog/Gli1 inhibitor linked
to anti-apoptotic signaling in IBC cells [32]. The compounds
were added during cell seeding to test their ability to disrupt
the formation and growth of spheroids during the 3-6 day
period in non-adherent culture. Representative images

from the high content analysis are shown in Figure 4 and
the numeric data from multiple such high content imaging
experiments were analyzed for quantitative measures
as elaborated in Table 1 for the treatment effects in both
SUM149 (Figure 4A, 4C) and rSUM149 cells (Figure 4B,
4D). Figure 5 details the multiparametric analysis of the
treated spheroids. Results show that compared to untreated
and DMSO (vehicle) treated cells, the NFκB inhibitor,
JSH23, was highly efficacious in disrupting formation of
both SUM149 and drug-resistant rSUM149 tumor spheroids
in culture (Figure 4B – v [SUM149] and vi [rSUM149]).
JSH-23 treatment significantly increased average YOYO-1
staining in both sensitive and resistant cell lines as well as
mitochondrial brightness, indicative of decreased cell health
(Figure 5A & 5B). In contrast, cells treated with the XIAP
antagonist, embelin did not completely inhibit formation of

tumor spheroids in the case of SUM149 cells (Figure 4B – iii
[SUM149] and iv [rSUM149]). However, embelin-treated
IBC tumor spheroids exhibited multiple empty/vacuolelike regions (shown by yellow arrows in Figure 4) in the
core compared to control spheroids and a 70% decrease
in spheroid area, 40% lower mitochondrial membrane
potential, and a 30-45% change in texture, shape, and aspect
ratio in SUM149 spheroids. Low YOYO-1 staining supports
the live-imaging observations (Figure 5) that embelin does
not significantly inhibit tumor spheroid formation in either
cell line. GANT61, which does not target the XIAP-NFκB
axis, did not have an appreciable effect on tumor spheroid
morphology in either cell lines at the concentration reported
previously to be effective in 2D cultures, relative to
untreated and DMSO controls, although certain parameters
like spheroid area, spheroid aspect ratio and roundness
were affected with treatment. None of the agents tested
have a significant impact on spheroid morphology (texture,
roundness, aspect ratio).
These results collectively show that quantitative
analysis of the images captured in these experiments
included the derivation of multiple parameters that allow
for the assessment of morphological features of 3D IBC
tumor spheroids, as well as viability and reveal that the
tumor spheroid-HCA assay may be suitable for highthroughput, multiparametric, anticancer drug screening.

enhances uptake in cancer cells and inhibits pNFκB
leading to decreased XIAP, enhanced oxidative stressinduced apoptosis and significant inhibition of SUM149
tumor growth in a murine xenograft model [19]. Based
on this we tested if the same DSF concentrations (100 nM
and 300 nM) in combination with copper chelation would
inhibit formation and viability of IBC tumor cell clusters.
The 3D high content IBC tumor spheroid assay showed
that compared to untreated, DSF combined with copper
was associated with extensive cell death (low spheroid
number and high YOYO-1 staining) in both the parental
SUM149 and the drug/apoptosis resistant rSUM149
cells (Figure 4B-vii and 4C [SUM149], 4B-viii and 4D
[rSUM149] & Figure 5).
To facilitate testing of extended dose responses
of compounds in multiple cell lines we optimized the
high content tumor spheroid assay for high throughput
in ultra-low attachment 384-well plates (Supplementary
Figure 1) with the result that one spheroid forms per
well as explained in Methods. Compounds were added
in 2-fold 10 point dose response in replicates of five
and subsequently stained with Hoechst 33342, YOYO1 and Mitotracker red dyes at 72h to assess spheroid
area, spheroid integrity, and active mitochondrial
content respectively. We tested the effects of DSF with
and without copper on two IBC cell lines SUM149
(Figure 6) and SUM190 (Figure 7). In both cell lines,
staurosporine, a potent cell death agent, was effective at
reducing spheroid area with a concomitant increase in
YOYO-1 staining reflecting spheroid disruption. DSF
alone at all concentrations tested, including the 300 nM
dose, had minimal affect on spheroid growth for both
SUM149 and SUM190 cells. As another control we also

tested a dose range of copper alone. As expected at the
10 μM dose there was no affect on spheroid area and
only an affect seen at very high non-physiological does
(160 μM). These studies further confirmed the effect of
the combination of DSF with Cu to be highly effective at
disrupting tumor spheroids in SUM149 cells as assessed
by decreased spheroid area (IC50 = 0.08 μM) and integrity
(increasing YOYO-1 IC50 = 0.2 μM). An approximately
2-fold increase in MitoTracker staining was also seen for
SUM149 cells when treated with DSF + Cu above 1μM.
GANT61, a hedgehog pathway inhibitor had minimal
effects on spheroid growth at the concentration tested
and served as a surrogate pathway control as it is not
recognized as a compound that inhibits XIAP or NFκB
expression. Furthermore, we investigated tumor spheroids
cultured from another patient primary tumor derived IBC
cell line, HER2 overexpressing SUM190 cells. SUM190
spheroid had about 45% decrease in area with increasing
staurosporine concentration (EC50 = 0.02 μM) and
YOYO-1 increases with both staurosporine and DSF + Cu
treatment, however, the data show that DSF-Cu treatment
was less potent when compared to its effect in the triple
negative, EGFR activated SUM149-derived spheroids.
Although most breast cancer cell lines form 3D
spheroids/mammospheres when grown in ultra-low
attachment conditions with spheroid-promoting media,
IBC tumor cell clusters/emboli are distinct due to their
unique presence and metastasis in the lymphatic system.
To study this, we used a recently reported method [27]

wherein IBC cells are cultured in media supplemented
with PEG-8000 and grown on an orbital shaker, simulating
the viscosity and shear force of the lymphatic system.
These conditions allow IBC cells to form tight tumor cell
clusters with similar phenotype and histological aspects
observed in tumor emboli found in patient samples. Data
in Figure 8 show formation of SUM149-derived embolic
structures in vitro over indicated time points and the
effect of compounds tested. SUM149 tumor emboli were
significantly inhibited by 100 nM DSF+10 μM Cu, with
an 89% reduction (P<0.005) in spheroid number relative
to untreated and most cells observed to be dispersed single
cells compared to DSF and copper alone. Taken together,
these results reveal the efficacy of DSF-Cu in targeting
the formation of IBC tumor clusters in culture using two
different assay conditions.

DISCUSSION
The key role of NFκB-associated pathways in IBC
compared to other stage- and subtype-matched advanced
breast cancers is based on three major lines of evidence.
First, identification of NFκB target genes involved in the
proliferation, inflammation and invasive processes that
are dysregulated at the clinical and molecular level in
IBC. Second, analysis of IBC tumors showing abnormal
expression of NFκB target genes involved in adaptive

of the anti-apoptotic signaling protein, XIAP, corresponds
with multi-drug resistance. The present study is the first
to identify that tumor emboli observed in IBC patient
tumor tissue express high levels of NFκB and XIAP. The
functional implication of the tumor emboli in IBC patients
can be envisioned to - 1) obstruct the draining lymph
vessels and explain the clinical feature of breast swelling,
chest wall inflammation and extreme pain; 2) be a key step
that drives the local spread of cancer cells throughout the
breast gland through self-seeding and invasion. Therefore,
there is a critical need to elucidate dysregulated pathways
that promote IBC tumor emboli formation in order to
design improved targeted therapeutics.
Due to the diffuse nature of IBC disease, it is
extremely difficult to obtain tissue with adequate numbers
of dermal tumor emboli and therefore, there is a need
for improved in vitro approaches. Multicellular culture
systems, in particular in vitro 3D spheroid models of
cancer cells, have shown wide applicability in preclinical
drug screening studies; however, there is continued need to
improve morphometric analysis of tumor cells comprising
the spheroids and to customize this analysis for different
cancer types. In the current study, we have optimized
a high content assay that is amenable to medium- to
high-throughput using a single-step multi-dye staining
protocol to simultaneously characterize and quantitate
multiple cell health characteristics of 3D IBC tumor
spheroids both basally and after treatment with candidate
compounds that can target XIAP and NFκB pathways.
The results of the present study identified that NFκB
inhibitors were potent in their ability to disrupt tumor
spheroid formation resulting in decreased viability and
changes in mitochondrial membrane potential during IBC
tumor spheroid formation. Compared to direct inhibition
of NFκB activity, embelin, which potentiates apoptosis
by relieving the inhibitory effect of XIAP on caspase 9
activity caused some increase in cell death, in particular in
the interior of the spheroids although the tumor spheroid
formation itself was not inhibited. We then extended this
method to multiple IBC cell lines, SUM149, SUM190 and
rSUM149, which is an isotype-matched therapeutically
resistant cell line derived from SUM149. Many of the
parameters tested exhibited similar results between the
lines although some dye-related differences were noted.
YOYO-1 staining was slightly different between these cell
lines (Figure 3E), possibly due to the higher levels of the
survival proteins like NFκB and XIAP in rSUM149 cells
relative to their parental counterparts [15]. Additionally,
we observed that some untreated spheroids tended to have
higher MitoTracker staining in the periphery relative to the
center of the spheroids. While this may be a physiological
phenomenon based on greater mitochondrial disruption
on the periphery of the spheroids, the increased thickness
in the center of the spheroids can lead to more light
absorption and needs to addressed using other dyes and
confocal imaging. The center of the spheroids may also be
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

hypoxic, which would reduce mitochondrial activity [33]
and we intend to investigate this possibility.
In addition to providing proof of principle for assay
robustness, our studies identified the efficacy of a FDAapproved drug disulfiram, which when combined with
Cu (DSF-Cu) has the ability to disrupt tumor spheroid
formation. Herein, we also observed efficacy of DSF-Cu
in disrupting emboli formation in a biologically relevant
culture model reported to mimic the physical properties
and environment of the dermal lymphatic system such
that only IBC cells like SUM149 and SUM190 compared
to other molecular-subtype matched non-IBC cells lines
form the 3D structures when grown under these culture
conditions [27]. Use of DSF-Cu as a therapeutic strategy
is gaining momentum based on recent studies in various
cancer types revealing the ability to target tumor cells
while having minimal effect on normal cells [34]. Our
previous study identified that in IBC cells, DSF-Cu
increases copper concentration in vivo, bypassing the
need for membrane transporters and this leads to increased
oxidative stress mediated cell death in IBC tumor cells
that are highly redox adapted [19]. Therefore, mechanisms
of oxidative stress signaling in IBC tumor emboli, both
in vitro and in vivo, warrant further investigation. Further
development of the high content 3D IBC assay will
increase the utility of this in vitro system for screening of
potential anticancer compound libraries, combinations of
drug modalities, and the effect of environmental chemicals.
Additionally, the combination of disulfiram+copper should
be tested in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) in vivo
models of IBC, which will provide a method most closely
modeling the human disease to assure disruption of IBC
emboli in a living model [35].
In summary, the present observations show high
NFκB expression along with its pro-survival signaling
partner, XIAP, in the tumor emboli of IBC patient tumor
tissue and efficacy of NFκB inhibitors like DSF-Cu in
preventing formation of IBC tumor cell clusters/spheroid
and emboli formation, considered a key feature of IBC
progression and dissemination. These results, along with
our previous report showing the ability of DSF-Cu to
inhibit in vivo SUM149 tumor growth, strengthen the
potential interest in pursuing DSF-Cu as a candidate for
clinical trials in IBC patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and materials
SUM149 and SUM190 were obtained from
Asterand, Inc. (Detroit, MI) and cultured as described
previously [12]. Characterization and authentication of the
cell lines were done at Asterand by short tandem repeat
(STR) polymorphism analysis. rSUM149 is an isotypematched drug resistant variant as previously described [13,
15] and cultured in SUM149 media supplemented with
25859

Oncotarget

7.5 μM of a research-grade lapatinib analog GW583340
(Tocris, Minneapolis, MN) 24h after splitting. All the cell
lines are also authenticated at regular intervals by STR
polymorphism analysis by the Duke DNA sequencing
core. Cells were cultured in growth medium at 37°C under
an atmosphere of 5% CO2, were banked upon receipt and
cultured for no more than 6 months prior to use in this
study. CuSO4 pentahydrate was purchased from VWR
(Radnor, PA) and GANT61, embelin, JSH-23, DSF from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

ng/mL basic FGF, 20 ng/mL EGF and B27 (1x Invitrogen)
for tumor spheroids and using Ham’s F12 media (as
explained in Cell Lines and Materials for the culture of
SUM149 cells) additionally supplemented with 2.25%
PEG-8000 as previously described [27] for tumor emboli.
For high-throughput spheroid applications, SUM149
(400 cells/well) and SUM190 (800 cells/well) cells were
plated in 384-well black walled, round-bottom optical
plastic ultra low attachment plates (Corning, Corning,
NY), centrifuged at 150 x g for 2 minutes and placed in
a tissue culture incubator overnight. For low-throughput
experiments, treatments were carried out at the time of
seeding, and spheroids were grown for up to 8 days as
indicated. 384-well plates for SUM149 and SUM190 cells
were treated 1 day after plating utilizing a D300 digital
compound dispenser (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA).
Stock solutions of embelin (100 mM) [17], GANT61
(10 mM) [28], JSH-23 (10 mM) [29], and DSF made in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and subsequently diluted in
media to concentrations as indicated, with concentrations
based on previously published data regarding cytotoxicity
of the compounds in SUM149 cells [15]. The final DMSO
concentration of these solutions ranged between 0.03-1%.

Immunohistochemistry
Antibodies for immunohistochemical staining of
p65 NFκB (clone C-20) and XIAP were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and BD
Biosciences (San Jose, CA), respectively. Tissue sections
stained for p65 NFκB were used as previously described
[26]. Archived tissue sections from the World IBC
consortium set with prior patient consent and approval
from the Institutional Review Boards from each center
obtained [6] were deparaffinized in a series of xylenes,
then rehydrated in 95%, 85%, 70% ethanol and washed
in distilled water and Dako wash buffer (Dako North
America, Inc. Carpinteria, CA) for 5 min. Antigen retrieval
was performed using citrate buffer pH6 incubated at 95°C
for 35 minutes. After cooling and washing in Dako wash
buffer, the slides were incubated with Dako peroxidase
block for 5 min at room temperature. After washing 3 x
5 min in wash buffer, slides were incubated overnight at
4°C with the mouse anti-human XIAP antibody solution
(1:60 dilution). After incubation, slides were washed
3 x 5 min with Dako wash buffer, then incubated in the
anti-mouse secondary solution (provided in the Dako
anti-mouse Envision kit) for 30 min at RT. To visualize
antibody binding, slides were incubated with DAB+
substrate (Dako) for 10 min at room temperature. Finally,
tissue sections were incubated in hematoxylin (Dako) for
30 seconds, washed in tap water and mounted for light
microscopy. Prostate cancer tissue was used as positive
control. A board-certified surgical pathologist scored the
slides in a blinded manner. Staining intensity was graded
on a qualitative scale (no staining [negative], very focal
or very weak staining [borderline], and positive) and
overall, the data were dichotomized as negative or positive
(including borderline).

Tumor spheroid high content, high throughput
multiparametric assay
To each well of the IBC tumor spheroids in 6-well,
24-well, 96-well plates, or 384-well plates, 1 mL, 250 μL,
50 μL, or 25 μL per well of pre-warmed 3x dye cocktail in
PBS (30 μg/mL Hoechst 33342, 300 nM YOYO-1, 1.5 μM
MitoTracker Red FM) was added, respectively. For the 96and 384-well plates, the cells are plated using a Multidrop
bulk dispenser and compounds added the following day
using a Hewlett Packard D300 Digital Dispenser. Plates
were then returned to the incubator for 1h followed by
fixation with 1 mL (6-well), 250 μL (24-well), 50 μL
(96-well), or 30 μL (384-well) of 10% formalin. Plates
were then imaged immediately, or sealed, protected from
light and stored at 4 °C overnight. Initial imaging was
conducted using a 4x objective for 96- or 384-well plates
and 10x objective for 6- and 24-well plates (96- and 384well round-bottomed plates were centrifuged for 1 min at
150 x g prior to imaging in order to center spheroid in
the well). Fluorescence quantification and localization was
determined using a ThermoFisher CellInsight NXT and
3-channel Cell Health Profiling protocol in HCS Screen
software (ThermoFisher). Excitation wavelengths used
were 386 nm, 485 nm, and 549 nm for Hoechst 33342,
YOYO-1, and MitoTracker Red FM, respectively. Fixed
exposure times were optimized in each channel for
each experiment and set so that camera pixel intensity
saturation was not reached. Images were then acquired
using an Olympus UPlanFLN 10X/0.30 objective for 6and 24-well plates or an Olympus UPlanSApo 4X/0.16
objective for round-bottom 96- and 384-well plates.

In vitro propagation of 3D IBC tumor spheroids
and emboli
SUM149 and rSUM149 cells were plated in 6-well
(40,000 cells/well), 24-well (10,000 cells/well) ultralow attachment, or 96-well (500-5,000 cells/well) black
walled, round-bottom optical plastic ultra-low attachment
plates (Corning, Corning, NY) using serum-free minimum
essential media (MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20

All conditions were conducted in triplicate for lowthroughput and quintuplicate for 384-well plate imaging
(Supplementary Figure 1).
A mask was established by the channel 1 signal
(Hoechst 33342) and used to determine general spheroid
characteristics (size, area, aspect ratio, roundness, and
texture) as well as to establish the regions of interest
for YOYO-1 and MitoTracker Red FM staining (area
inside channel 1 spheroid mask). YOYO-1 signaling was
calculated using channel 2 mean or total average intensity
and MitoTracker Red FM signaling was calculated using
channel 3 mean target total intensity for mitochondrial
mass and channel 3 mean target average intensity for
mitochondrial brightness. Data analysis was performed
after retrieving data sets from HCS View software
(ThermoFisher) and normalizing to mean DMSO values.
Image montages were generated for 6- and 24-well plates
with data analysis applied only to objects identified
entirely within one field of view. Spheroids in the multiwell round-bottom low attachment plates were centered
in one field of view and analyzed accordingly. Spheroids
out of focus or not entirely contained in the single field of
view were excluded from analysis.
