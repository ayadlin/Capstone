Abstract
Plasticity in cancer stem–like cells (CSC) may provide a key basis for cancer heterogeneity and therapeutic
response. In this study, we assessed the effect of combining a drug that abrogates CSC properties with standardof-care therapy in a Ewing sarcoma family tumor (ESFT). Emergence of CSC in this setting has been shown to arise
from a defect in TARBP2-dependent microRNA maturation, which can be corrected by exposure to the
ﬂuoroquinolone enoxacin. In the present work, primary ESFT from four patients containing CD133þ CSC
subpopulations ranging from 3% to 17% of total tumor cells were subjected to treatment with enoxacin,
doxorubicin, or both drugs. Primary ESFT CSC and bulk tumor cells displayed divergent responses to standard-ofcare chemotherapy and enoxacin. Doxorubicin, which targets the tumor bulk, displayed toxicity toward primary
adherent ESFT cells in culture but not to CSC-enriched ESFT spheres. Conversely, enoxacin, which enhances
miRNA maturation by stimulating TARBP2 function, induced apoptosis but only in ESFT spheres. In combination,
the two drugs markedly depleted CSCs and strongly reduced primary ESFTs in xenograft assays. Our results
identify a potentially attractive therapeutic strategy for ESFT that combines mechanism-based targeting of CSC
using a low-toxicity antibiotic with a standard-of-care cytotoxic drug, offering immediate applications for clinical
evaluation. Cancer Res; 74(22); 6610–22. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor cell plasticity and heterogeneity may actively shape
response to conventional chemotherapy in solid malignancies
and underlie relapse following seemingly successful treatment.
Heterogeneity among tumor cells within the same tumor mass
may arise by numerous nonmutually exclusive mechanisms.
They include stochastic genetic (1) and epigenetic (2) changes
that cause intrinsic differences among cancer cells, leading to
clonal selection; microenvironmental cues that induce phenotypic and functional differences among cancer cells in different
locations (3); and hierarchical organization of tumor cells,
where a small, poorly differentiated cell subpopulation with
self-renewing and tumor-initiating properties gives rise to

more differentiated cells, most of which have lost tumorigenicity (4). Cells that occupy the apex of such hierarchies are
currently referred to as cancer stem cells (CSC). Whereas the
existence and properties of CSC have been well established in
certain leukemias (5), they have been somewhat more challenging to deﬁne in solid malignancies, partly because of the
lack of robust cell surface markers and partly because lineage
tracing in epithelial and mesenchymal tumors is less well
deﬁned than in hematopoietic malignancies. Nevertheless,
there is growing evidence to support the existence of CSC in
solid tumors of diverse ontogeny and histotypes (6, 7).
In addition to providing a driving force for tumor growth and
maintenance, CSC may display different sensitivity to cytotoxic
drugs and radiotherapy than the bulk tumor cell population
that they generate (8–10). Thus, in at least some tumor types,
CSC may withstand conventional anticancer therapy consistent with their presumed role in relapse following therapy,
while possibly responding to approaches that impair pluripotency. Attempts to augment therapeutic effectiveness in
tumors with a documented cellular hierarchy should therefore
include strategies that target not only rapidly dividing bulk and
progenitor cells, but CSC plasticity as well.
Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT), the second most
frequent bone malignancy in children and young adults (11),
are among the few sarcoma types in which CSCs have been
identiﬁed and characterized (12). ESFT pathogenesis is dictated by a chromosomal translocation that creates a fusion
between sequences encoding the EWSR1 transactivation
domain and those encoding the DNA-binding domain of one
of several possible ets transcription factor family members. In

Targeting Cellular Heterogeneity in Ewing Sarcoma

85% of ESFT cases, the EWSR1 fusion partner is FLI-1, resulting
from the chromosomal translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) (13).
The EWS-FLI1 fusion gene encodes an aberrant transcription
factor, which, in a permissive cellular context, triggers transcriptional reprogramming that culminates in target cell
transformation.
Primary ESFT harbor a subpopulation of cells that express
CD133, a hematopoietic stem-cell marker associated with, but
not speciﬁc for, CSCs in a variety of solid tumors (12). These
cells constitute 3% to 15% of most primary ESFT and display
plasticity, clonogenicity, tumor-initiating capacity, and the
ability to generate nontumorigenic progeny, all of which are
consistent with CSC features. Moreover, primary ESFT cells
retain CSC properties when cultured as spheres under low
attachment conditions in serum-free knockout (KO) medium
but lose them in serum-supplemented monolayer culture (14).
We recently discovered that ESFT CSC display partial and
reversible repression of TARBP2, which participates in maturation of small noncoding RNAs (microRNAs, miRNAs), resulting in a defective miRNA repertoire (14). By binding to the
complementary sequences in multiple different transcripts,
miRNAs can modulate the expression of entire gene networks
(15), and miRNA implication in the pathogenesis of diverse
cancers is well established (16). Defective TARBP2-dependent
miRNA maturation causes downregulation of a broad miRNA
repertoire that contributes to the emergence of CSC in ESFT
(17), whereas restoration of its expression by introduction of
exogenous TARBP2 abrogates CSC properties (14). Enhancement of TARBP2 function may, therefore, provide an attractive
therapeutic strategy toward eliminating CSCs in ESFT.
Their poor prognosis despite aggressive multimodal therapy
(11), dependence on EWS-FLI-1 expression as the sole oncogenic event in the majority of cases (18), and possession of an
identiﬁed mechanism that underlies the emergence of their
CSC subpopulation render ESFT an ideal candidate malignancy to address the effect of combining conventional standardof-care chemotherapy with selective CSC targeting. Enoxacin, a
ﬂuoroquinolone family antibiotic used for treatment of urinary
tract infections, increases TARBP2 binding afﬁnity for its
precursor miRNAs in mammalian cells, resulting in the
enhancement of miRNA maturation (19). Accordingly, we have
shown that enoxacin can impair ESFT CSC properties in vitro
by restoring their miRNA repertoire (14). Here, we assessed the
effect of enoxacin alone or in combination with standard-ofcare therapy on primary ESFT xenografts in vivo in an effort to
deﬁne a clinically relevant therapeutic strategy that targets
both CSCs and the tumor bulk. We show that such an approach
has a potent inhibitory effect on ESFT growth in vivo and that it
may provide an attractive therapeutic option.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
A673 (ATCC) and TC252 (kindly provided by Dr. T. Triche,
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern
California, Los Angeles, CA) ESFT cells lines were cultured in
RPMI (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS (Gibco). Primary
ESFT samples were obtained at surgery with the approval of
the ethics committee of the Canton de Vaud. All human

www.aacrjournals.org

samples were anonymized before analysis and were exempted
from informed consent in accordance with the law of the
Canton de Vaud. Spheres were cultured in IMDM (Gibco),
supplemented with 20% KO serum (Gibco), 10 mg/mL LIF
(Millipore), 10 ng/mL recombinant human EGF (Invitrogen),
and 10 ng/mL recombinant human bFGF (Invitrogen) in ultralow attachment ﬂasks (Corning). Adherent cells were derived
from spheres by culture in IMDM (Gibco) supplemented with
10% FCS (Gibco). Human pediatric mesenchymal stem cells
(hpMSC) were isolated and cultured as described (17). shRNA
depletion of TARBP2 was performed as described (14).
RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using Trifast (Peqlab) as recommended. Real-time PCR was performed as previously described
(17). TaqMan probes included 18S, OCT4, and NANOG (Applied
Biosystems). Primer sequences for ONECUT2 SYBR Green gene
expression quantiﬁcation were: forward, 50 -CTCTTTGCGTTTGCACGCTG-30 ; reverse, 50 -GGAATCCAAAACCGTGGAGTAA30 . For microRNA quantiﬁcation, 30 ng of total RNA was
ampliﬁed using the miRCURY LNA Universal RT microRNA
PCR Kit (Exiqon) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. LNA PCR primers (Exiqon) were used for RT-PCR
ampliﬁcation, and snord49a provided the endogenous control.
Cell growth, apoptosis, Western blot, and FACS analysis
ESFT cell lines were plated in triplicate wells and total cell
counts and cell viability were determined using Trypan Blue.
MTS assays were performed according to standard procedures
(CellTiter 96; Promega). FACS analysis using anti-CD133 antibody (Miltenyi) was performed as previously described (12).
Cells (sphere/adherent/cell lines) were harvested with their
medium and apoptosis assays were performed using the FITC
Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences) as
recommended. Western blot analyses were performed according to standard procedures, with anti-TARBP2 antibody from
Abnova (#MAB0811).
Clonogenic and tumorigenicity assays
Single primary ESFT cells were suspended in four 96-well
plates and cultured for 30 days in IMDM, 20% KO serum,
supplemented with LIF, EGF, and FGF and treated with DMSO
or 40 mg/mL enoxacin. Spheres were scored 15 days later. Five
thousand sphere-derived or adherent ESFT cells were injected
beneath the renal capsule of 18 NSG mice each. All mice were
sacriﬁced 3 months later and kidneys subjected to histologic
analysis.
Mouse treatment, tumor monitoring, and statistical
analysis
Experimental protocols involving mice were approved by
the Veterinary Service of the Canton of Vaud (Etat de Vaud,
Service Veterinaire), under authorization number VD2488.
NSG mice (2  28) were anesthetized and 10,000 spherederived cells from ESFT-3 and 5,000 sphere-derived ESFT-1
cells were injected beneath the renal capsule and allowed to
engraft for 10 days. DMSO (10%) or enoxacin 50 mg/kg in 10%
DMSO was then administered i.p. with or without doxorubicin,

0.5 mg/kg weekly. Tumor growth was monitored by ultrasound
imaging using a 40-MHz probe and the Vevo 2100 Ultrasound
machine (VisualSonics). Tumor volume was calculated by V ¼
4/3 p(Dd  Ds  Dt)/8, where Dd corresponds to tumor height,
and Ds and Dt to tumor lengths measured in long- and shortaxis views, respectively. When control tumors reached 1 cm3,
mice were sacriﬁced. Tumors were then harvested and processed for RNA extraction, H&E staining, IHC and, when
possible, 200 mg of tumor tissue was enzymatically dissociated
for single-cell CD133 FACS analysis. Five thousand cells from
treated tumors were reinjected into new recipient NGS mice
and left to grow for 6 to 8 weeks. All statistical analyses were
performed using GraphPad Prism 6.

Results
Characterization of the ESFT CSC model in vitro and
in vivo
ESFTs from four patients were obtained at surgery. ESFT-1,
ESFT-2, ESFT-3, and ESFT-4 expressed variant 1 of the EWSFLI-1 fusion protein and were, respectively, a retroperitoneal
tumor removed immediately following chemotherapy, an
untreated vertebral tumor, a metastatic lesion to the lung
following relapse and failure of multiple rounds of chemotherapy, and a tumor that had relapsed 7 years following cessation
of treatment. Freshly removed cells from each of the four
tumors were assessed for CD133 expression, sphere-forming
ability in vitro, and tumorigenic potential in vivo. CD133þ cells
represented 5.7% and 10.1% of the total tumor cell population
of ESFT-1 and -4, respectively, (Supplementary Fig. S1A),
whereas the starting material of ESFT-2 and -3 was insufﬁcient
to allow for FACS analysis. Cells from all four tumors formed
spheres under appropriate culture conditions and the CD133þ
population within cultured spheres ranged from 2.7% to 40%.
The CD133 bulk of the tumor cells did not possess spherogenic properties. After 2 to 3 weeks of culture in serum-free
medium, CD133þ cell-derived spheres were disaggregated and
half of the cells were reseeded in suspension in serum free,
growth factor–supplemented knockout (KO) medium (14),
whereas the other half were plated as adherent monolayers
in serum-supplemented medium. Thus, all subsequent comparisons for response to treatment in vitro were made on cells
derived from the same initial population.
Upon injection of 5,000 cells into the subcapsular renal
compartment of NOD/SCID/c-gKO (NSG) mice, all spherederived cells formed tumors that phenocopied the original
growth (data not shown). In contrast, the same number of
adherent cells from three (ESFT-1, -2, and -4) tumors did not
display tumor-initiating capacity, whereas adherent ESFT-3
cells formed tumors that grew more slowly than their spherederived counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S1B). It is possible
that metastasis-derived cells, which had survived numerous
rounds of chemotherapy, incurred genetic events that were not
epigenetically erased by in vitro culture and that may confer
tumor-initiating capacity to a broader cell subpopulation,
reducing cellular hierarchy (18).
Consistent with our earlier observations that ESFT CD-133þ
sphere-forming cells display defective maturation of miRNAs,
including regulators of core reprogramming gene expression

6612

(14), NANOG and OCT4 transcripts were signiﬁcantly higher in
spheres than in adherent cells from all four tumors, the greatest
difference residing in ESFT-2 cells derived from an untreated
tumor (Fig. 1A). ESFT-3–adherent cells, which retained tumorinitiating capacity, had NANOG and OCT4 expression levels
closer to those of the corresponding spheres than their ESFT-1,
-2, and -4 counterparts (Fig. 1A). A subset of TARBP2-dependent miRNAs whose repression is implicated in ESFT tumorigenesis was downregulated in spheres from all three tumor
samples (Fig. 1B), consistent with a reversible defect in miRNA
maturation in KO-cultured tumorigenic cells, as previously
suggested (14).
ESFT spheres and adherent cells display reciprocal
sensitivity to doxorubicin and enoxacin in vitro
Because chemoresistance is one of the suggested CSC
properties in at least some tumor types (20), we compared
sensitivity to doxorubicin, a ﬁrst-line cytotoxic drug in ESFT
(11), of primary ESFT cells grown as spheres and as adherent
monolayers. Cells were treated with single 10-fold incremental
doses of doxorubicin (within a concentration range of 17.2 to
1,720 nmol/L) for 96 hours in culture and assessed for proliferation by an MTS assay, normalized to that of DMSO-treated
cells. All four tumor-derived adherent cell cultures were signiﬁcantly more prone to growth inhibition by doxorubicin than
their sphere counterparts at all concentrations tested (Fig. 2A).
On the basis of our earlier demonstration that enoxacin
inhibits growth of ESFT cell lines in vitro, we explored the effect
of the drug on primary ESFT. Dose–response analysis within a
range of 5 to 80 mg/mL revealed signiﬁcant inhibition of ESFT-1
sphere growth at 10 mg/mL with a near maximal effect at 40
mg/mL (data not shown). We therefore subjected the four
tumor-derived cell batches to enoxacin at a dose of 10 mg/mL,
which corresponds to plasma concentrations of the drug
administered to patients with urinary tract infection (21), and
observed signiﬁcant growth inhibition of spheres from all four
ESFTs (Fig. 2B). Enoxacin had a minor effect on TC 252 ESFT
cells, but no effect on either A673 ESFT cells or primary
hpMSCs, from which ESFT are believed to originate
(Fig. 2B; ref. 17). Importantly, enoxacin had a distinct effect
on ESFT spheres and adherent cells, with virtually no inhibition
of adherent ESFT-2, -3, and -4 cell growth (Fig. 2C). To further
interrogate the role of TARBP2 repression in ESFT cell sensitivity to enoxacin, proliferation of A673 cells depleted of
TARBP2 by targeted shRNA expression was assessed in
response to 10 mg/mL of enoxacin. As expected, inhibition
of proliferation was markedly stronger in TARBP2-depleted
than in control A673 cells after 48 and 72 hours of treatment
(Fig. 2D).
Enoxacin induces CD133þ cell death and abrogates ESFT
self-renewal in vitro
Having shown that ESFT spheres display sensitivity to
enoxacin at low doses, we addressed the selectivity of the
effect of enoxacin for CSCs by examining CD133þ cell viability
(Fig. 3A, left) following in vitro treatment with enoxacin at 40
mg/mL (the dose previously applied to ESFT cells; ref. 14). Cells
were colabeled with Annexin, PI, and anti-CD133 antibody and

gating adjusted to either the CD133þ or the CD133-population
(Fig. 3A, right and Supplementary Fig. S2). CD133þ cells from all
four tumors displayed signiﬁcant to near total (ESFT-2) induction of apoptosis in response to treatment (Fig. 3A, left). CD133
cells from ESFT-1 and -3 were resistant to enoxacin (Fig. 3A, left),
whereas ESFT-2 and -4 CD133 cells displayed sensitivity that
was closer to that of the corresponding CD133þ cells.
Because enoxacin induced apoptosis in 50% to nearly 100%
of the ESFT CD133þ cells in vitro, we assessed whether depletion of these cells corresponds to loss of self-renewal by plating
a single ESFT cell per well in a 96-well plate and adding DMSO
or enoxacin to the culture medium. After 2 weeks, almost no
spheres formed in enoxacin-supplemented ESFT-1 and ESFT-2
cultures (Fig. 3B). Some spheres were still formed by ESFT-3
and ESFT-4 cells, which were derived from a tumor that had
become resistant to all conventional treatment regimens and a
tumor that had relapsed 7 years following cessation of treatment, respectively.

ESFT-1 and ESFT-3. To assess the effect of enoxacin treatment in vivo, 5,000 ESFT-1 cells and 10,000 ESFT-3 cells were
injected into the subcapsular renal compartment of NSG
mice and allowed to engraft for 10 days. Two groups of six
mice each were administered either DMSO or enoxacin (50
mg/kg i.p. daily 5 days a week, which corresponds to a
slightly higher dose than that used for urinary tract infections in humans; ref. 21), and the response was monitored by
ultrasound imaging until control tumors reached a volume
of 1 cm3. Animals were then sacriﬁced and tumors processed
for histologic analysis. Consistent with its targeting of a
small subpopulation of cells, enoxacin had a limited effect
on tumor weight (Fig. 4A, left). However, enoxacin-treated
tumors displayed a distinct consistency and gross appearance compared with control tumors that reﬂected partial
tissue disaggregation and multifocal necrosis (Fig. 4B).
Assessment of CD133 expression in residual tumor cells
revealed that the treatment had almost completely depleted
the CD133þ subpopulation in ESFT-1 (Fig. 4A, right). A
similar trend was observed in ESFT-3 xenotransplants albeit
with greater variability (Fig. 4A, right). Both xenografts were
composed of typical ESFT small round cells and expressed
CD99 as assessed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4C).

hardly affected by enoxacin alone and only mildly so by
doxorubicin alone (Fig. 5A), combined doxorubicin–enoxacin
treatment markedly decreased tumor volume, as assessed by
ultrasonography 4 weeks following initiation of the treatment
(Fig. 5A), without signiﬁcantly affecting body weight. Accordingly, at autopsy, 7 days following the ultrasonography images
shown in Fig. 5A, tumor weight was found to be mildly
decreased by enoxacin alone, more markedly so by doxorubicin
alone and strongly by the combination of the two drugs (Fig.
5B). Comparable differences in response were observed upon
treatment of ESFT-1 xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Assessment of CD133 expression following treatment of
ESFT-1 and ESFT-3 conﬁrmed the observations made in vitro.
The fraction of CD133þ cells was unaltered in doxorubicin
only–treated tumors, whereas enoxacin only–treated tumors
had decreased CD133þ cell counts (Fig. 5C). Combined treatment markedly depleted CD133þ cells (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S2B).

doxorubicin-treated mice (Fig. 6A). Live-cell counts revealed
a robust decrease in living ESFT-1 cells per gram of tumor,
consistent with histologic ﬁndings (Fig. 6B).
To verify that the effect of enoxacin on primary ESFT did not
reﬂect off-target effects, we assessed miRNA expression in
residual tumors. Expression of a subset of TARBP2-dependent
miRNAs was increased in combination-treated tumors compared with control or doxorubicin alone–treated tumors (Fig.
6C), consistent with the mechanism of action of enoxacin in
restoring TARBP2-dependent miRNA maturation (19).
Serial transplantation of residual ESFT-1 cells from
tumors having undergone combined treatment shows a
decrease in tumor-initiating capacity
To assess whether combined enoxacin/doxorubicin treatment of ESFT xenografts eradicates tumor-initiating cells,
5,000 unsorted cells from treated xenografts were injected
beneath kidney capsules of NSG recipient mice and allowed
to engraft without any additional treatment. Whereas cells
from all seven of seven control tumors and ﬁve of seven
doxorubicin only–treated tumors developed new growth 8
weeks following serial xenotransplantation, cells from combination-treated tumors reinitiated tumor growth in only 3 of 7
mice (Fig. 6D). The CD133þ population persisted in both
control and residual tumors from doxorubicin only–treated
mice and was either unchanged or increased in tumors that
arose from serial xenotransplantation of these residual cells
(Fig. 6E). In contrast, CD133þ cells were strongly depleted or
absent in residual tumors from mice that had received the
combined enoxacin–doxorubicin treatment. However, in the

three tumors that grew as a result of serial xenotransplants
of cells from residual combination-treated tumors, CD133þ
cells reemerged and formed roughly 1% to 2% of the tumor bulk
(Fig. 6E).
Identiﬁcation of a candidate predictor of ESFT response
to enoxacin that may also serve as a potential prognostic
marker
Our observations suggest that ESFT patients who are likely
to beneﬁt from enoxacin treatment could be selected on the
basis of their CSC miRNA proﬁle. However, such an approach
would be highly impractical. We therefore sought for a protein
whose expression in ESFT cells, modulated by TARBP2-dependent miRNAs, may predict responsiveness to enoxacin. We ﬁrst
identiﬁed 111 common target genes of at least three of ﬁve
TARBP2-dependent miRNAs, which are consistently downregulated in CSC, including let-7f, miRNA-145, miRNA-181a,
miRNA-26a, and miRNA-100 (Supplementary Table S1).
Assessment of the collective relevance of these common
targets to ESFT pathogenesis was performed by clustering a
cohort of 44 primary ESFT patients available from GEO under
the accession number GSE17679 based on expression of the 111
genes and comparing the two clusters for survival. Clear
separation in survival probability between the two clusters
that fell just below statistical signiﬁcance was observed (Fig.
7A). Assessment of the possible relationship between individual gene expression and patient survival in the 44 primary ESFT
cohort revealed that at a 10% FDR, 37 of 111 probes signiﬁcantly correlated with survival (Fig. 7A and B). Among them,
onecut2, a miRNA-regulated homeobox protein implicated in
hepatocyte (22) and neural differentiation (23), epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT), and colon cancer prognosis
(24), appeared as a candidate prognostic marker. ESFT patients
with onecut2 expression above and below the median value
displayed signiﬁcant difference in survival (Fig. 7C). Moreover,
onecut2 expression in ESFT CD133þ cells (Fig. 7D) and spheres
(data not shown) correlated with responsiveness to enoxacin
as assessed by clonogenicity and Annexin PI assays (Fig. 7D).
Interestingly, the highest expressor of onecut2, ESFT2, also
displayed the greatest difference in expression levels of
TARBP2-dependent miRNAs between spheres and adherent
cells. Thus, onecut2 may be a candidate predictor of response
to enoxacin, pending validation in a large number of primary
tumors.

Discussion
Our present observations support the notion that ESFT CSC
and cells that constitute the ESFT bulk display distinct sensitivity to different therapeutic regimens. Thus, doxorubicin,
an intercalating agent (25) that targets rapidly proliferating
tumor cells and is currently the main agent of ﬁrst line
chemotherapy in ESFT treatment (11), had little effect in vitro
on ESFT spheres, which are enriched in CSC, whereas it was
signiﬁcantly more toxic to adherent cells, which more closely
recapitulate the tumor bulk. Conversely, enoxacin, which like
other ﬂuoroquinolones targets type II and type IV topoisomerases in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respec-

tively (19), but which in mammalian cells augments TARBP2
afﬁnity for its substrate pre-miRNAs, leading to increased
miRNA maturation (19), affected cells grown as spheres but
spared adherent cells. In response to enoxacin, sphere-derived
cells lost clonogenic properties and in two out of the four
primary tumor samples, CD133þ subpopulations underwent
massive apoptosis.
Importantly, doxorubicin and enoxacin displayed a synergistic effect on primary ESFT xenotransplants in vivo. Doxorubicin alone had virtually no effect on ESFT-1 and only a
moderate effect on ESFT-3 xenografts, but its effectiveness was
markedly increased when combined with enoxacin. As a single
agent, doxorubicin only mildly affected the CSC compartment,
if at all, in vivo, as CD133þ cell numbers in both ESFT-1 and
ESFT-3 cells were comparable in control and doxorubicintreated tumors. Furthermore, there was little difference in the
initiation of tumor growth after secondary transplantation of
cells from untreated or doxorubicin-treated tumors. Thus,
whereas it eliminates a substantial portion of cells that constitute the tumor bulk, doxorubicin spares sufﬁcient tumorinitiating cells to allow regrowth following cessation of treatment. In contrast, enoxacin depletes the CSC compartment,
even at the relatively mild doses used to treat infection, but
leaves rapidly dividing cells that form the tumor mass largely
unscathed. Surprisingly, enoxacin only–treated tumors displayed focal necrosis and tumor cell dissociation, suggesting
vascular and/or extracellular matrix (ECM) defects. ESFT cells
can form vessel-like tubes in vitro and express genes associated
with vasculogenic mimicry (26), possibly in relation to the
function of FLI-1 as a major endothelial transcription factor
(27). Similar to their glioblastoma counterparts (28), a fraction
of ESFT CSCs may undergo vascular reprogramming and
participate in tumor vascularisation. Their selective targeting
may provide a possible explanation for the observed multifocal
necrosis and changes in tumor architecture in response to
enoxacin.
In combination, enoxacin and doxorubicin depleted the
CD133þ CSC compartment and induced massive cell death
in the tumor bulk, leaving small, highly necrotic tumors.
Moreover, xenografts from both a primary (ESFT-1) and a
highly aggressive terminal phase tumor that had escaped all
conventional therapeutic regimens (ESFT-3) responded to the
combined treatment, suggesting that such a strategy may be of
beneﬁt even in late-stage disease, irrespective of lengthy prior
exposure to chemotherapy. In vitro data suggest that the
observed synergy between doxorubicin and enoxacin is not
the result of cumulative drug toxicity (Supplementary Fig. S1C)
but is primarily due to their targeting of different cell subpopulations. However, the markedly stronger inhibition of
tumor growth by combined enoxacin–doxorubicin treatment
compared with that of either drug alone suggests that in
addition to targeting a distinct cell subpopulation, enoxacin
may potentiate the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin, possibly by
targeting CSCs that undergo reprogramming toward vasculogenic mimicry leading to increased vascular permeability,
which may facilitate doxorubicin delivery.
Consistent with the notion that enoxacin depletes CSC, cells
from residual doxorubicin/enoxacin-treated tumors displayed

Targeting Cellular Heterogeneity in Ewing Sarcoma

impaired tumor-initiating capacity compared with cells from
control and doxorubicin only–treated tumors. Interestingly,
the tumors that did form contained a CD133þ cell subpopulation despite the fact that the injected cells had no detectable
CD133 expression. Although we cannot formally exclude the
presence of a few undetected CD133þ cells in residual tumors
following combined treatment that reconstituted the CD133þ
subpopulation, it is conceivable that CD133þ cells in the
secondary xenotransplants emerged as a result of reprogramming of nontumorigenic cells toward the CSC phenotype.
Mounting evidence indicates that nontumorigenic cells may
undergo such reprogramming, thereby resuming initiation of
tumor growth even after seemingly effective CSC eradication
(29). Maintenance of combined targeting of CSCs and the
tumor bulk therefore seems recommended for the duration
of the treatment.
The observations that defective TARBP2 function underlies
ESFT CSC emergence and that ﬂuoroquinolones enhance
TARBP2 activity and corresponding miRNA maturation have
led to the discovery of unpredicted synergy between enoxacin
and standard-of care-chemotherapy toward controlling ESFT
growth. As our understanding of mechanisms that are responsible for CSC emergence is still in its infancy, it is difﬁcult to
predict how broadly applicable to divergent tumor types such
an approach may be. Nevertheless, our observations demonstrate that combining doxorubicin with enoxacin provides a
rational, mechanism-based therapeutic approach in ESFT that
successfully targets two key cell subpopulations.
