Abstract
Retinoid X receptor (RXR) regulates key cellular responses such as cell growth and development, and this
regulation is frequently perturbed in various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However,
the molecule(s) that physically govern this deregulation are mostly unknown. Here, we identiﬁed RXR as an
interacting partner of astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1)/metadherin (MTDH), an oncogene upregulated in all
cancers. Upon interaction, AEG-1 profoundly inhibited RXR/retinoic acid receptor (RAR)–mediated transcriptional activation. Consequently, AEG-1 markedly protected HCC and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells
from retinoid- and rexinoid-induced cell death. In nontumorigenic cells and primary hepatocytes, AEG-1/RXR
colocalizes in the nucleus in which AEG-1 interferes with recruitment of transcriptional coactivators to RXR,
preventing transcription of target genes. In tumor cells and AEG-1 transgenic hepatocytes, overexpressed AEG-1
entraps RXR in cytoplasm, precluding its nuclear translocation. In addition, ERK, activated by AEG-1, phosphorylates RXR that leads to its functional inactivation and attenuation of ligand-dependent transactivation. In nude
mice models, combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and AEG-1 knockdown synergistically inhibited
growth of human HCC xenografts. The present study establishes AEG-1 as a novel homeostatic regulator of RXR
and RXR/RAR that might contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. Targeting AEG-1 could sensitize patients with HCC
and AML to retinoid- and rexinoid-based therapeutics. Cancer Res; 74(16); 4364–77. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Retinoid X receptors (RXRs a, b, and g) are the master
coordinators of cell growth, metabolism, and development (1,
2). RXRs heterodimerize with one-third of the 48 human
nuclear receptor superfamily members, including retinoic acid
receptor (RAR; ref. 3). RXR/RAR heterodimer mediates the
retinoid-dependent transcription of genes involved in cell
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. RXRs are fre-

quently dysregulated because of altered expression and inactivation in various cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), thyroid carcinoma, and prostate cancer (4–6),
which might lead to compromised RAR functions in these
malignancies (7–9). However, molecular mechanisms or regulators that govern the differential expression and function of
RXR still remain poorly understood.
AEG-1, also known as MTDH and LYRIC, is a multifunctional
oncogene that is overexpressed in a wide variety of malignancies (10, 11). AEG-1 is signiﬁcantly upregulated in >90% of
human patients with HCC, affecting diverse aspects of HCC
pathogenesis, including proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion,
and metastasis (12, 13). Although numerous studies have
established clinicopatholgic correlation of AEG-1 in cancer,
the underlying molecular mechanism by which AEG-1 exerts
its oncogenic functions requires further clariﬁcation. AEG-1
has been shown to interact with few proteins to drive tumorigenesis (10). To identify crucial AEG-1–interacting partners,
we screened a human liver cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid
(Y2H) assay (14), and identiﬁed RXR as a novel interacting
partner of AEG-1.
Using human HCC cell lines with endogenous low and high
AEG-1 expression corresponding with low to high aggressive
tumorigenic features, HCC cells with stable AEG-1 overexpression or knockdown and hepatocytes isolated from AEG-1
transgenic (Alb/AEG-1; ref. 13) and knockout (AEG-1KO) mice,
we have now deciphered how AEG-1 interaction with RXRa
and RXRb drives RXR-mediated functions in HCC. Our studies

uncover the mechanism by which AEG-1 upregulation affects
RXR inactivation and retinoid response contributing to carcinogenesis. Moreover, AEG-1 knockdown and chemical inhibition of AEG-1–mediated signaling enhances the efﬁcacy of
retinoids by sensitizing the cells, leading to inhibited tumor
growth in in vitro and xenograft models. AEG-1 inhibition
might be an effective strategy to augment effects of retinoids
in patients with diverse cancer indications.

Materials and Methods
Generation of Alb/AEG-1 and AEG-1KO mice
Generation and characterization of a hepatocyte-speciﬁc
AEG-1 transgenic mouse (Alb/AEG-1) in B6/CBA background
have been described previously (13). AEG-1KO mouse was
generated in C57B6/129Sv background and the procedure is
described in detail in the Supplementary Information. All
animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at Virginia Commonwealth University, and were conducted in accordance with the Animal
Welfare Act, the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals, and the U.S. Government Principles for
the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing,
Research, and Training.
Tissue culture
HepG3, QGY-7703, THLE3, Hep3B, HuH7, and HEK-293 cells
were cultured as reported earlier (12). Generation of Hep-PC-4
(control clone), Hep-AEG-1–14 (a C-terminal HA-tagged AEG1–overexpressing clone), Hep-CTRLsi (control siRNA-expressing clone), and Hep-AEG-1si (expressing AEG-1 shRNA) in
HepG3 background has been described before (12, 14). A Cterminal HA-tagged AEG-1 construct mutated at the LXXLL
motif was stably expressed in HepG3 cells, Hep-AEG1-Lxxmut,
and was generated following the same protocol as for HepAEG1–14 cells. The clones were selected and maintained in
hygromycin containing DMEM.
Primary cell culture and viability assay
Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from wild-type
(WT; B6/CBA), Alb/AEG-1, WT (C57B6/129Sv), and AEG-1KO
mice in the Cell and Molecular Biology Core in VCU as
described previously (13) and were plated on collagen-coated
dishes (BD BioCoat collagen type I; BD Biosciences) and
cultured in Williams E. medium (SIGMA) containing
NaHCO3, L-glutamine, insulin (1.5 mmol/L) and dexamethasone (0.1 mmol/L). For MTT assays, a total of 1.0 to 1.5  104
mouse hepatocytes were plated in each well of a 96-well plate
and treated with retinoids and rexinoids for respective time
points as mentioned in the ﬁgure legends of Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. S3. Cell viability was determined by standard MTT assay as described previously (12, 15, 16).
Transient transfection and luciferase reporter assays
Transfections and luciferase assays were done according to
the manufacturer's protocol for human HCC cells as described
elsewhere (14, 17, 18) and primary hepatocytes (Supplementary
Information). Each experiment was performed in triplicates
and repeated three times to calculate means and SE.

Total RNA extraction, cDNA preparation, and real-time
PCR
Total RNA was extracted from human HepG3 cells, livers
and hepatocytes of WT (B6/CBA and C57B6/129Sv), Alb/AEG1, and AEG-1KO mouse using the QIAGEN miRNAeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN). cDNA preparation was done using the ABI cDNA
Synthesis Kit. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
was performed using an ABI ViiA7 fast real-time PCR system
and TaqMan gene-expression assays according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). The best available
TaqMan primers–probes spanning two exons for RARB,
CYP26A1, NROB2, CRABP2, FOXA1, TLL1, RXRA, and RXRB for
human as well as mouse were purchased from ABI.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Sheared chromatin was prepared following the manufacturer's instructions and was immunoprecipitated using RXRa
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AHH3 (Acetyl Histone H3) and
SRC-1 (steroid receptor coactivator-1; Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies. The eluted DNA and inputs were subjected to
PCR for RARB and HOXA1 genes. For RARB2 (sense: 50 AGCTCTGTGAGAATCCTGGGAG30 , antisense: 50 TAGACCCTCCT
GCCTCTGAACA30 ) and HOXA1 (sense: 50 CTGGGG CAATCAGATTCAAACC30 , antisense: 50 CTCAGATAAACTGCTGGGACTC30 ) primers were used for PCR ampliﬁcation using the Taq
PCRx Polymerase Kit (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. These PCRs were performed without
enhancers and repeated at least three times.
Nude mice xenograft studies
Subcutaneous xenografts were established in ﬂanks of
athymic nude mice using QGY-7703 cells (5  105). After
1 week, these mice were injected with all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA; 10 mg/kg) or DMSO i.p., a total of seven injections,
once every alternative day. One week after the ﬁnal treatment, mice were sacriﬁced. Tumor volume was measured
twice weekly with a caliper and calculated using the formula
p=6larger diameter ðsmaller diameterÞ2 . Tumor samples were immunostained using antibodies against AEG-1,
PCNA (Cell Signaling Technology), and cleaved caspase-3
(Cell Signaling Technology). All experiments were performed
with 6 to 8 mice in each group and were repeated at least two
times.
Statistical analysis
Data were represented as mean  SEM and analyzed for
statistical signiﬁcance using one-way ANOVA followed by the
Newman–Keuls test as a post hoc test. A P value of <0.05 was
considered as signiﬁcant.

Results
Identiﬁcation of RXRa and RXRb as AEG-1–interacting
partners
AEG-1 is a 582 amino acid (a.a.) protein with a transmembrane domain (51–72 a.a.) and multiple nuclear localization
signals. A number of AEG-1–interacting proteins have been
identiﬁed that interact with its large C-terminal region (14, 17).

AEG-1 Regulates Retinoid X Receptor to Drive HCC

However, a "LXXLL" motif, by which coactivators and corepressors interact with nuclear receptors (19), is located in the
NH2-terminal region of AEG-1, suggesting that this region
might be important for AEG-1 functions. On the basis of this,
a human liver cDNA library was screened by Y2H assay using
the NH2-terminal 1–57 a.a. of AEG-1 as bait, which lead to
identiﬁcation of RXRb as an AEG-1–interacting protein (Supplementary Table S1). Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays
using lysates from the human HCC cell line QGY-7703 demonstrated pull-down of RXRa and RXRb by anti–AEG-1 antibody and vice versa, conﬁrming the interaction (Fig. 1A).
Deletion of a.a. 1 to 70 from N-terminus (N1) of AEG-1 and
mutations in its LXXLL motif prevented the interaction of
AEG-1 with RXRa and RXRb (Fig. 1B). However, this interaction was maintained in full-length AEG-1 or upon deletion of
C-terminal region (1–513), validating that RXRs indeed interact
with AEG-1 at its LXXLL motif. Further to check at which
domain of RXR AEG-1 interacts with, we made domain-speciﬁc
deletion constructs of RXRa (Supplementary Fig. S1). Deletion
of the C-terminus ligand-binding AF-2 domain of RXRa
resulted in the loss of interaction, whereas deletion of its
NH2-terminus AF-1 and DNA-binding domain (DBD) did not
affect the interaction of AEG-1 with RXRa (Fig. 1B). These
ﬁndings demonstrated that AEG-1 binds RXRa at its ligandbinding domain (LBD), the same domain in which coactivators
and corepressors also bind.
Co-IP assays using stable clones of human HCC HepG3 cells
overexpressing AEG-1 (Hep-AEG-1–14), AEG-1 knockdown
(Hep-AEG-1si), and control clone Hep-PC-4 cells (12) conﬁrmed that the interaction of AEG-1 with RXRa and RXRb is
indeed AEG-1–dependent (Fig. 1C). Double immunoﬂuorescence analysis in HepG3 cells detected colocalization of AEG-1
with RXRa and RXRb predominantly in the nuclear and perinuclear regions, which was not observed upon AEG-1 knockdown (Fig. 1D).
RAR/RXR–mediated promoter activities are inhibited by
AEG-1
RAR/RXR binds to retinoic acid response elements (RARE)
on the target promoters. Basal luciferase reporter activity
of RARE-containing plasmid, pGL3–RARE–luc was decreased
in Hep-AEG-1–14 clone and increased in Hep-AEG-1si cells
compared with control Hep-PC-4 and Hep-CTRL-si clone,
respectively (Fig. 1E). RARE activity remained suppressed
even upon treatment with different retinoic acid/retinoids
(RA) and rexinoids (RXA) in Hep-AEG-1–14 cells, whereas it
was signiﬁcantly augmented in Hep-AEG-1si cells (Fig. 1E,
Supplementary Fig. S2A). As a corollary, both basal and
ligand-dependent RARE activity was signiﬁcantly inhibited in
Alb/AEG-1 hepatocytes (Fig. 1F) and ampliﬁed in AEG-1KO
hepatocytes (Fig. 1G).

HepG3 cells express low levels of AEG-1 and are nontumorigenic in nude mice, whereas QGY-7703 cells express high levels
of AEG-1 that generate very aggressive tumors (12). Consequently, both basal and ligand-dependent RARE activities were
markedly less in QGY-7703 cells as compared with HepG3 cells
(Fig. 1H). Transient overexpression of AEG-1 in HepG3 and
HEK-293 cells inhibited, whereas transient knockdown of AEG1 by siRNA augmented ligand-dependent RARE activity (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Transient expression of full-length AEG-1 that interacts with
RXRs decreased RARE activity, whereas AEG-1 deletion constructs N1 and N2 (lacking NH2-terminal 70 and 100 a.a.,
respectively), and LXXLL-mutant expression construct failed
to inhibit RARE activity in HepG3 (Fig. 1I) or HEK-293 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). AEG-1 expression level in the cells
used in this study is shown in Fig. 1J. Taken together, AEG-1–
RXR interaction affected RXRs negatively and AEG-1 upregulation led to a decrease in RXR-dependent RARE reporter
activity. These activities were increased upon inhibiting this
interaction, suggesting that AEG-1 provides a homeostatic
balance to RXR functions.
AEG-1 provides protection from retinoid- and rexinoidinduced inhibition of cell growth
Because the RAR/RXR pathway mediates antiproliferative
effects of retinoids and rexinoids, we determined the extent to
which AEG-1 might provide protection. Using eight different
RA and RXA and their synthetic analogs at multiple doses
(Supplementary Table S2), we documented that Hep-AEG1–14
cells displayed 2- to 3-fold resistance and Hep-AEG-1si cells
showed enhanced sensitivity to different RA/RXA treatment at
different doses up to 96 hours, when compared with control
Hep-PC-4 cells (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3H). Colony
formation assays also conﬁrmed marked protection from RAand RXA-mediated inhibition of cell growth in Hep-AEG-1–14
cells and potentiation of cell growth inhibition in Hep-AEG-1si
cells (Fig. 2B). Similarly, QGY-7703 cells with basal high AEG-1
expression displayed resistance toward RA/RXA as compared
with HepG3 (Supplementary Fig. S3Q).
WT hepatocytes showed <25% cell growth inhibition at 48
hours, whereas only <5% in Alb/AEG-1 hepatocytes, even at
high doses of different RA/RXA (data not shown). At 96 hours,
WT hepatocytes showed variable cell viability with different
doses of retinoids and rexinoids. However, Alb/AEG-1 hepatocytes were noticeably protected from inhibition of cell
growth with >80% viability (Fig. 2C). Conversely, AEG-1KO
hepatocytes demonstrated marked decrease in cell growth
with retinoids and rexinoids at 48 to 96 hours in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S3I–S3P). We
next tested whether AEG-1 had any effect on retinoid-mediated
killing in other cancer cells such as human acute myelogenous

(Continued.) RARE activity was measured in untreated (UT) or upon treatment with 5 mmol/L ATRA, 2 mmol/L 9CRA, 400-nm bexarotene or 1 mmol/L TTNPB for
24 hours in PC-4, AEG1–14, CTRL-si, and AEG-1si cells (E), WT and Alb/AEG-1 (F), WT versus AEG-1KO mice hepatocytes (G), and HepG3 versus QGY7703
cells (H). I, RARE activity was measured 48 hours after cotransfection of pcDNA3.1, AEG-1FL, AEG-1 deletion mutants N1 and N2 (101–582), and

member 2 (NR0B2), Homeobox A1 (HOXA1), cellular retinoic
acid–binding protein 2 (CRABP2), and Forkhead box protein
A1 (FOXA1). Hep-AEG-1–14 cells showed signiﬁcant downregulation of all these genes at basal level and post 9-cis reinoic
acid (9CRA) or ATRA treatment, when compared with control
Hep-PC-4 (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Similar
decrease and corresponding increase in the above-mentioned
genes were also observed in Alb/AEG-1 and AEG-1KO hepatocytes, respectively (Fig. 3B and C and Supplementary Fig.
S4B–S4C). The RA negatively regulated gene, Tll1 showed
signiﬁcant upregulation in Alb/AEG-1 hepatocytes with or
without ligand, and a reduction in AEG-1KO hepatocytes at
basal level (Supplementary Fig. S4B–S4C). Downregulation of
RA-responsive gene, RARB, which determines cell growth and
apoptosis, was conﬁrmed in additional Alb/AEG-1 mice (Supplementary Fig. S4D).
AEG-1 impairs the RXR-binding and coactivator
recruitment to RXR/RAR target genes
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using the RA target genes RARB and HOXA1. In the
absence of ligand, signiﬁcantly decreased and increased
recruitment of RXRa was observed in both target gene promoters in Hep-AEG-1–14 and Hep-AEG-1si cells, respectively,
as compared with Hep-PC-4 cells (Fig. 3D and Supplementary
Fig. S4E). Similar effects were also observed for (AHH3) and
SRC-1. Upon treatment with 9CRA or ATRA, RXRa recruitment
did not change substantially, whereas both AHH3 and SRC-1
recruitment was signiﬁcantly augmented in all three cell
lines. However, ligand-induced recruitment of AHH3 and
SRC-1 was notably less in Hep-AEG-1–14 cells and more in
Hep-AEG-1si cells (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S4E). To
check whether AEG-1 interferes with DNA-binding property
of RXR, EMSA was performed in a cell-free system using
in vitro translated RARb, RXRa, and AEG-1 using a DR5 RARE
response element as probe. RARb/RXR heterodimer efﬁciently
bound to DNA in the absence or presence of ATRA, which was
not affected by addition of AEG-1 (data not shown). These
ﬁndings suggest that AEG-1 does not interfere with DNAbinding or heterodimerization of RXR with its partners rather
it might modulate coactivator/corepressor recruitment. The
decreased recruitment of RXRa to RARB or HOXA1 promoter
in Hep-AEG-1–14 cells might be due to reduced levels of
nuclear RXRs in these cells, a hypothesis we will address in
subsequent sections.
Next, we measured RARE reporter activity in control and
AEG-1–overexpressing cells with coexpression of a corepressor
Silencing mediator for retinoid/thyroid hormone receptors
(SMRT) or a coactivator, SRC-1. SMRT overexpression led to
a minimal but signiﬁcant reduction in RARE activity (Fig. 3E).
Interestingly, SRC-1 overexpression profoundly elevated RARE
activity in Hep-AEG-1–14 cells similar to Hep-PC-4 cells without SRC-1 overexpression (Fig. 3E). Histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA), markedly induced basal RARE
activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3F). Collectively,
these ﬁndings suggest that overexpressed AEG-1 competes
with the coactivators to bind RXR by interacting through the
LXXLL motif maintaining histones in a deacetylated state.

AEG-1 upregulation leads to cytoplasmic translocation
of RXRs
Co-IP analysis using nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions demonstrated that AEG-1 interaction with RXRs mainly occurs in
the cytoplasm of Hep-AEG-1–14 cells and in the nucleus in
control cells (Fig. 4A). Immunoﬂuorescence studies revealed
that AEG-1 resides mainly in the nucleus of control Hep-PC-4
cells and WT hepatocytes, which show low AEG-1 expression
(Fig. 4B and C and Supplementary Fig. S5). However, in HepAEG-1–14 cells and Alb/AEG-1 hepatocytes, AEG-1 displays
predominantly cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 4B and C and
Supplementary Fig. S5), which has been attributed to the
enhanced monoubiquitination and stabilization (13, 20). Interestingly, AEG-1 overexpression and cytoplasmic translocation
also resulted in the coordinated translocation of RXRa and
RXRb from nucleus to the cytoplasm in Hep-AEG-1–14 cells.
Although in Hep-PC-4 cells, AEG-1/RXR interaction took place
predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig.
S5). As nuclear receptors shuttle between the cytoplasm and the
nucleus, we determined whether cytoplasmic retention of RXRs
might depend on ligand. Treatment with 9CRA or ATRA at
various doses up to 24 hours, failed to induce nuclear translocation of RXRa and RXRb in AEG-1–overexpressing cells,
suggesting that AEG-1 entraps RXRs into cytoplasm obstructing
their nuclear import (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S5).
In WT hepatocytes, RXRa is distributed throughout the
cell but more in the nucleus, and RXRb showed universal
staining. 9CRA treatment induced the import of RXRa and
RXRb into the nucleus (Fig. 4C). In contrast, both RXRa and
RXRb were mostly cytoplasmic in Alb/AEG-1 hepatocytes
and 9CRA treatment did not alter this proﬁle signiﬁcantly
(Fig. 4C). Dominant to complete cytoplasmic localization of
AEG-1 and RXRs was dependent upon AEG-1 expression
level (Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6E). Cytoplasmic translocation of AEG-1 and RXR was not affected upon culturing them
on collagen–ﬁbronectin matrix and synchronization (Supplementary Fig. S6F–S6G).
Double immunoﬂuorescence analysis of AEG-1 with RXRa
and RXRb was performed using HepG3 stable clone overexpressing AEG-1 mutated at the LXXLL motif (Hep-AEG1LXXmut). Interestingly, both RXRa and RXRb remain nuclear
and do not translocate to cytoplasm in these cells (Fig. 4D),
conﬁrming that AEG-1 indeed brings RXRs to the cytoplasm,
which is prevented upon losing the interaction.
AEG-1 induces phosphorylation and inactivation of RXRs
by activating ERK and p38MAPK signaling
Both RXRa and RXRb levels were signiﬁcantly higher in HCC
cells compared with normal immortal human hepatocytes
(THLE-3) cells (Fig. 5A). Moreover, truncated form of RXRa
(tRXRa, arrow in Fig. 5A) accumulated more in different HCC
cell lines. RXRa and RXRb were also upregulated in AEG-1–
overexpressing systems: Hep-AEG-1–14 cells and Alb/AEG-1
hepatocytes and downregulated in AEG-1 knockdown cells
(HepAEG-1si; Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S7A). However,
their mRNA levels were reduced in Hep-AEG-1–14 cells and
Alb/AEG-1 hepatocytes (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S7B–

AEG-1 Regulates Retinoid X Receptor to Drive HCC

modiﬁcation of RXRs by AEG-1. Interestingly, phosphorylation
of RXRa and RXRb at serine residues was conspicuously
induced in different AEG-1 overexpression systems: Alb/
AEG-1 hepatocytes, QGY-7703, and Hep-AEG-1–14 cells (Fig.
5D and E). Phosphorylation was inhibited in Hep-AEG-1si cells
in comparison with control cells, which might reﬂect the
reduction of total RXR (Fig. 5D). More phosphorylated RXRa
was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of Hep-AEG1–14 cells although phospho forms of tRXRa and RXRb
remained prevalent in the nucleus (Supplementary Fig.
S7D). Inhibition of nuclear phosphorylated RXRa and RXRb
in Hep-AEG-1si cells might explain increased RARE reporter
activity, expression of RAR/RXR target genes, and apoptosis
(Fig. 1 and 2).
Different kinases have been reported to phosphorylate
RXRa in HCC (21–23). We tested which kinase might be
responsible for AEG-1–dependent RXR phosphorylation in
HCC cells by using speciﬁc inhibitors (Supplementary Table
S2). Inhibition of PKA, PKC, JNK, ERK, and p38MAPK led to
downregulation of pRXRa and p-tRXRa in AEG-1–speciﬁc
manner (Fig. 5F and G and Supplementary Fig. S7E–S7G).
pRXRb was also reduced to a greater extent in Hep-AEG1–14
cells upon inhibiting PI3K, JNK, ERK, p38MAPK, and TK (Fig.
5F and G and Supplementary Fig. S7E–S7G). RXRDN antibody detecting all isotypes of RXR showed none to minimal
effect of the inhibitors on the full-length RXR. However,
RXRa-speciﬁc antibody detected inhibition of both pRXRa
and p-tRXRa (Fig. 5F and G). Moreover, combined inhibition
of PI3K and p38MAPK synergistically decreased phosphorylation of tRXRa.
RARE activity was signiﬁcantly augmented in AEG-1 stable and transient overexpressing cells upon inhibition of
ERK, PKA, and p38MAPK (Fig. 5H and Supplementary Fig.
S8A–S8B). ERK has been shown to phosphorylate RXRa at
the serine 260 residue in HCC, and inhibition of ERKmediated RXR phosphorylation led to most increase in RARE
activity in a dose- and AEG-1–dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S8C). We also checked the expression of
representative RXR/RAR target genes; RARB, HOXA1,
CYP26A1, and NR0B2 upon inhibition of various kinases
(Fig. 5I and Supplementary Fig. S8D). ERK inhibition
retrieved the expression of all the genes at various extents
in AEG-1–overexpressing cells. PKA and p38MAPK inhibitors speciﬁcally increased the expression of RARB and
HOXA1/FOXA1, respectively. Notably, siRNA mediated
knockdown of AEG-1 in HepG3 (1.3-fold) and QGY-7703
cells (2-fold) and RXRa overexpression in only QGY-7703
cells augmented ligand-dependent RARE activity (Supple-

mentary Fig. S8E), conﬁrming the AEG-1 caused inactivation
of RXR in tumorigenic HCC cells, which was signiﬁcantly
retrieved by AEG-1 knockdown or RXRa overexpression.
Synergistic antitumor effect of AEG-1 inhibition and
ATRA administration in HCC xenografts in nude mice
The in vitro growth-suppressing function of retinoids upon
AEG-1 knockdown was extended by in vivo assays. Because,
QGY-7703 cells develop aggressive tumors in nude mice, we
transduced them with none, control lentivirus–expressing
scrambled shRNA (shControl) and AEG-1 knockdown lentivirus (shAEG-1; ref. 24). These cells were then subcutaneously
xenografted into the ﬂanks of male athymic nude mice. One
week after implantation, when tumor is well established, the
mice were treated with i.p. injections of DMSO (vehicle) or
ATRA (10-mg/kg body weight). In DMSO-treated-only and
DMSO-treated shControl groups, tumor gradually increased
in size as reﬂected by tumor volume measured twice a week,
and tumor weight at the ﬁnal day of experiment (Fig. 6A–C). In
ATRA-treated groups, only two of the 8 mice showed reduction
in tumor growth, which was not signiﬁcant. In the shAEG-1
DMSO–treated animals, the tumor growth was signiﬁcantly
suppressed as compared with controls and the ATRA-treated
group. Interestingly, the shAEG-1 ATRA-treated animals grew
none to minimal tumors in size and weight (Fig. 6A–C). Three
of 8 shAEG-1 ATRA–treated mice showed no tumor or smaller
tumor than 0 day of treatment. Their combination effect was
calculated as 0.78 (<1 ¼ synergistic), indicating synergism.
Histologic analysis of the tumors revealed signiﬁcantly
increased necrosis/apoptosis in the shAEG-1 ATRA–treated
group compared with others (Fig. 6D top). Immunohistochemical studies conﬁrmed knockdown of AEG-1 in shAEG-1 groups
(Fig. 6D and E). In addition, there was marked downregulation
of the cell proliferating marker PCNA and upregulation of
apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 in tumors derived from
shAEG-1 ATRA, shAEG-1, and ATRA, respectively, as compared
with the DMSO control and shControl DMSO groups (Fig. 6D
and E).

Discussion
Molecular mechanism(s) by which RXR controls diverse
cellular functions, including cell proliferation and metabolism,
has been thoroughly investigated. However, only a few reports
have addressed the molecular regulators of RXR itself, which
might be indispensable in evaluating and improving retinoidand rexinoid-based chemotherapy. Our current observations
suggest that AEG-1 negatively regulates functions of RXRs by
interacting through the LXXLL motif at the AF-2 ligand-

We document that AEG-1 not only inhibits RXR-mediated
transcriptional regulation, but also induces RXR phosphorylation via ERK and p38MAPK pathways, which are known to be
activated by AEG-1 (12). Phosphorylated RXRs are resistant to
ubiquitin proteasome–mediated degradation and act dominant negatively for normal RXR functions by abrogating heterodimerization and coactivator(s) recruitment (25, 26), which
is indispensable to drive the oncogenic functions. Therefore,
inhibition of these molecules suppressed AEG-1–mediated
phosphorylation of RXR and rescued transcriptional activation
of genes regulating cell proliferation in HCC. RXRa is proteolytically degraded generating N-terminally truncated 44-kDa
receptor (tRXRa) that interacts with the p85a subunit of PI3K
and activates protumorigenic PI3K/AKT signaling (27). Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway regulates AEG-1–mediated
resistance to apoptosis (28), and AEG-1–induced tRXRa generation might lead to PI3K/Akt activation.
Our ﬁndings reveal that overexpressed cytoplasmic AEG-1 in
tumorigenic cells leads to dominant to exclusive cytoplasmic
translocation of RXRa and RXRb. RXRs shuttle between the
cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments during certain stages
of development, in response to ligand, differentiation, apoptosis, and inﬂammation (29–32). Furthermore, tRXRa has been
shown to be exclusively cytoplasmic (27). Overall, RXRs might
be regulated by AEG-1 through histone (de)acetylation in
normal cells and via cytoplasmic entrapping and phosphorylation in human cancer cells. It should be noted that treatment
with ERK inhibitor increased RA-dependent gene expression
but did not increase nuclear translocation of RXR (data not
shown). We observed phosphorylation of both nuclear and
cytoplasmic RXR in AEG-1–overexpressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S7D). ERK inhibition might dephosphorylate nuclear
RXR, leading to its increased activity without resulting in
nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic RXR, which remains
entrapped in the cytoplasm because of physical interaction
with AEG-1.
One important consequence of RXRs inhibition by AEG-1
is abrogation of RA-induced gene transcription. Inactivation
or downregulation of RARB and other RAR/RXR downstream
genes have been reported in various malignancies with
increased cell survival and augmentation of disease (8). A
transgenic mouse expressing dominant negative RARa
develops spontaneous HCC (9). By negatively regulating the
retinoid-inducible genes, such as RARB and CRABP2, important regulators of normal cell growth, AEG-1 provided
signiﬁcant protection from cell growth inhibition by different retinoids/rexinoids whereas AEG-1 knockdown potentiated these effects. Similar level of AEG-1–mediated resistance in HL-60 cells provided the importance of AEG-1 in
determining response to retinoid, a frontline therapy for
leukemia.
Retinoids and rexinoids have been evaluated as candidates
for cancer chemoprevention from past two decades (33, 34);
however, there have been multiple drawbacks and limitations.
One important factor is that retinoid signaling is often lost or
compromised in carcinogenesis, leading to retinoid ineffectiveness and resistance (35–37). An important reason is the
inactivation/inhibition of RXR and/or RAR pathways in various

4376

Cancer Res; 74(16) August 15, 2014

cancers, including breast cancer, HCC, and AML (36–38).
Combination of AEG-1 inhibition with ATRA treatment
resulted in tremendous synergistic inhibition of tumor growth
in HCC xenograft assays, and demonstrated reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis. Targeting AEG-1 could enhance
the efﬁcacy of retinoids- and rexinoids-based therapeutics
overcoming drawbacks in HCC and other malignancies,
including leukemia. This hypothesis needs to be conﬁrmed
using orthotopic xenograft models in nude mice and endogenous tumor models.
In summary, a schematic representation is presented to
describe AEG-1–driven regulation of RXRa and b (Fig. 7).
Generally, RXR heterodimerizes with RAR and binds to target
gene promoters recruiting the corepressor complex in the
absence of ligand, and coactivators in the presence of ligand,
thus regulating transcription of target genes for normal cell
proliferation and apoptosis. AEG-1 in the nucleus of normal
nontumorigenic cell balances this phenomenon by interfering
with coactivator recruitment. When AEG-1 increases and
accumulates in the cytoplasm of tumorigenic cells, this equilibrium is perturbed. First, AEG-1 translocates and entraps
RXRa and b into cytoplasm obstructing RXR binding and
transcriptional activation of target genes. Second, AEG-1
induces phosphorylation of RXRs that act dominant negatively
on normal RXR. Finally, RXRa truncation is also elevated by
AEG-1. All together, AEG-1 upregulation causes inactivation of
RXRs, thereby negatively affecting downstream signaling, thus
favoring unrestrained cancer cell proliferation leading to HCC
and other cancers.
