Abstract

Author Manuscript

Whether whole-chromosome aneuploidy promotes tumorigenesis has been controversial, in large
part because of the paucity of insight into underlying mechanisms. Here we identify a mechanism
by which mitotic chromosome segregation errors generate DNA breaks via the formation of
structures called micronuclei. Whole chromosome-containing micronuclei form when mitotic
errors produce lagging chromosomes. We tracked the fate of newly generated micronuclei and
found that they undergo defective and asynchronous DNA replication, resulting in DNA damage
and frequently pulverization of the chromosome in the micronucleus. Micronuclei can persist in
cells over several generations but the chromosome in the micronucleus can also be distributed to
daughter nuclei. Thus, chromosome segregation errors potentially lead to mutations and
chromosome rearrangements that can integrate into the genome. Pulverization of chromosomes in
micronuclei may also be one explanation for “chromothripsis” in cancer and developmental
disorders, where isolated chromosomes or chromosome arms undergo massive local DNA
breakage and rearrangement.

development remains controversial1,2. This contrasts with chromosome breaks and

rearrangements, which are known to produce cancer-causing mutations. Recent genetic
evidence demonstrates that increased rates of whole chromosome missegregation can
accelerate oncogenesis3-6; however, the only established mechanism by which whole
chromosome segregation errors promote tumourigenesis is by facilitating the loss of
heterozygosity for tumour suppressors7. Intriguingly, two animal models where whole
chromosome segregation errors result in robust tumour development also display extensive
structural alterations in chromosomes6,8. This raises the interesting question of whether
errors in mitosis can predispose to DNA damage. We considered the possibility that
segregation of chromosomes into micronuclei (MN) might produce DNA damage. Whole
chromosome containing MN form from anaphase lagging chromosomes9-13; MN can also be
generated from acentric fragments of chromosomes11. MN have many features of primary
nuclei, but much controversy surrounds their actual composition and functional properties.
Studies differ on whether MN are transcriptionally active, replicate DNA, mount a normal
DNA damage response, or assemble normal nuclear envelopes; moreover, the ultimate fate
of chromosomes trapped within MN remains unclear11,14,15.

DNA damage in micronuclei

Author Manuscript

To determine if newly formed whole-chromosome MN develop DNA damage, we generated
MN in synchronised cells and tracked them through the cell cycle. As a first synchronisation
approach, MN were generated in non-transformed RPE-1 and transformed U2OS cells by
release from nocodazole-induced microtubule depolymerisation. When mitotic cells are
released from nocodazole, spindles reassemble abnormally, producing merotelic kinetochore
attachments (one kinetochore attached to two opposite spindle poles), lagging chromosomes,
and ~10% of cells with MN16. Because prolonged mitotic arrest causes DNA
damage17,18,19, RPE-1 cells were arrested for a short (6 h) interval with nocodazole.
Following release from the 6 h nocodazole block, neither the primary nuclei nor the newlyformed kinetochore-positive MN exhibited significant DNA damage during the subsequent
G1 phase as measured by damage-dependent phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX20
(γ-H2AX foci formation; Fig. 1a-c, Supplementary Fig. 2a-f), TUNEL labelling to detect
DNA breaks21 (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2e,f) and visualization of DNA breaks with the
comet assay22 (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e).

Author Manuscript

Because aneuploidy can produce a p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest23,24, p53 was silenced
by RNAi to allow us to monitor the fate of micronucleated RPE-1 cells at later stages of the
cell cycle. As expected, upon S-phase entry, low-level DNA damage was detected in both
the MN and the primary nucleus25; however, in G2 phase cells, the majority of MN showed
DNA damage while almost none was detected in the primary nucleus (Fig. 1a-d). Similar
results were observed in U2OS cells (Supplementary Fig. 3) and in cells where merotelic
kinetochore-microtubule attachments were generated by knockdown of the kinetochoreassociated microtubule depolymerase MCAK26 or the kinetochore protein Nuf227
(Supplementary Fig. 4a-c). MCAK knockdown does not delay cells in mitosis,
demonstrating that the acquisition of DNA damage in MN is independent of mitotic
arrest17,18,19. This damage did not represent activation of apoptosis because it was not
accompanied by caspase-3 activation, and it was not suppressed by a pan-caspase inhibitor
(Supplementary Fig. 5).

As a completely independent method of generating MN, we utilized a human cell line
(HT1080) carrying a human artificial chromosome (HAC) with a kinetochore that could be
conditionally inactivated28. In this system, kinetochore assembly on the HAC is blocked
simply by washout of doxycycline from the medium; consequently, the HAC is unable to
attach to the mitotic spindle and is left behind at anaphase, ultimately reforming as a MN
(Fig. 2a). Results obtained with the HAC-containing MN (Fig. 2b-d) were in agreement with
the results obtained by the other synchronization methods described above. Taken together,
MN do not exhibit significant DNA damage during G1 but a large fraction of MN acquire
DNA damage during S-phase that persists into G2.

Defective DNA replication in micronuclei

Author Manuscript

To directly determine whether acquisition of DNA damage in MN requires DNA replication,
synchronized micronucleated cells were released into medium containing thymidine to block
DNA replication. Blocking DNA replication with thymidine abolished the acquisition of
DNA damage (Fig. 3a-c), demonstrating that the breaks in MN occur in a replicationdependent manner.

Author Manuscript

We next tested whether the acquisition of DNA damage in MN is mediated by aberrant
DNA replication. This possibility was suggested because MN in G2 cells that had γ-H2AX
foci, almost always also labelled for phosphorylated RPA2 (Ser33)29, a marker of DNA
replication stress (Supplementary Fig. 4d). Moreover, the characteristic BrdU labelling
patterns of early, mid, and late S-phase cells30 suggested that DNA replication in MN is
inefficient and asynchronous with the primary nucleus (Fig. 3d). By measuring the
fluorescence intensity of BrdU relative to DNA area from single focal plane confocal
images, DNA replication in MN was detected at a markedly reduced level throughout Sphase when compared to the primary nuclei (Fig. 3e). Interestingly, pulse-labelling with
BrdU demonstrated asynchronous DNA replication of the MN relative to the primary
nucleus, with ~30% of MN replicating DNA in G2 cells (22 h; Fig. 3d).

Author Manuscript

The compromised DNA replication observed in newly-formed MN led us to test whether
complexes necessary to license DNA replication origins are recruited to chromosomes in
MN. The first step in assembling replication origins is the loading of the origin recognition
complex (ORC) after chromosome decondensation during telophase31. Quantitative
fluorescence imaging suggested that ORC recruitment is equally efficient in the MN as in
the primary nucleus (Supplementary Fig. 6a). By contrast, newly-generated MN showed
significant reduction in the recruitment of replicative DNA helicase components, Mcm2 and
Mcm332,33 as well as the replication initiation factor Cdt131 (Fig. 4a,b, Supplementary Fig.
6b,c). We observed an increased recruitment of MCM subunits into MN as cells progressed
through the cell cycle, but the levels of MCM subunits never exceeded 20% of that observed
in the primary nucleus (Fig. 4b).
To examine whether the DNA damage response in MN was also abnormal, cells were
treated with replication inhibitor, aphidicolin, or exposed to 2 Gy irradiation, to induce
damage and then labelled to detect components of the DNA damage response. After
aphidicolin treatment, MN showed clear signal for γ-H2AX and its kinase ATR (ataxia

telangectasia mutated-related) but downstream constituents of the DNA damage response
such as 53BP1 were not efficiently recruited, as previously reported34 (Supplementary Fig.
7). A similar defect in the recruitment of DNA damage response factors into micronuclei
was also observed after irradiation (Supplementary Fig. 8a). This recruitment defect had
clear consequences for DNA damage repair: whereas γ-H2AX foci were resolved in primary
nuclei by 6 h after 2 Gy irradiation, γ-H2AX foci persisted in MN for > 24 h
(Supplementary Fig. 8b). The failure of MN to recruit MCM subunits and components of the
DNA repair machinery may be due, at least in part, to a defect in nucleocytoplasmic
transport. Newly-formed MN have a marked reduction in the density of nuclear pores11,14,15
(Supplementary Fig. 9) and exhibit strongly reduced nuclear import (Fig. 4c-d,
Supplementary Fig. 10).

Micronuclei and chromosome pulverization
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Next we tested the prediction that abnormal DNA replication in MN could generate
chromosome breaks. Chromosome spreads were prepared from non-transformed cells in the
first cell cycle after release from nocodazole or from DMSO-treated controls (Fig. 5a-f,
Supplementary Fig. 11a). Strikingly, 7.6% of chromosome spreads prepared from
micronucleated cells released from nocodazole block (n=722) exhibited chromosomes with
a “pulverized” appearance, characterized by fragments of DAPI-staining material that were
often clustered into a discrete location on the spread35 (see yellow arrows in Fig. 5a, i;
Supplementary Fig. 11b). By contrast, pulverization was exceedingly rare (0.14%) in
controls. Multicolor fluorescence chromosome painting (SKY) confirmed that 34 of 47
spreads with “pulverized” chromosomes were composed of fragments from a single
chromosome and another eight were from two chromosomes (Fig. 5a-i; Supplementary Fig.
11). Despite this striking disruption to chromosomal structure, only one cell harboured nonreciprocal chromosome translocations 24 h after nocodazole release (n=101) whereas no
translocations were observed in control cells (data not shown). 72 h after nocodazole release
(n=100), we still did not detect chromosome translocations, but did detect truncated or
derivative single chromosomes in three cells. Although our experiments show that whole
chromosome mis-segregation does not produce frequent nonreciprocal translocations, we do
not exclude the possibility that the DNA damage acquired in MN could result in
translocations, albeit at a frequency lower than ~1/100 per generation.

Author Manuscript

Chromosome pulverization has been observed in cell-fusion experiments where
chromosomes from an S-phase cell are pulverized because of exposure to signals from
mitotic cytoplasm36. It has also been observed when aberrant late-replicating chromosome
translocations are generated37. The mechanism of pulverization involves compaction of
partially replicated chromosomes induced by mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase activity,
termed premature chromosome compaction (PCC)35,38,39. By labelling micronucleated and
control cells for 2 h with BrdU immediately prior to chromosome condensation and mitotic
arrest, we found that 25/30 pulverized chromosomes were undergoing DNA replication (Fig.
5h). The fact that only MN incorporate BrdU in G2 cells (Fig. 3d, Fig. 5g) demonstrates that
the pulverized chromosomes are derived from MN.

The fate of chromosomes in micronuclei

Author Manuscript

We next addressed the potential for chromosome aberrations acquired in MN to be
reincorporated into the genome. We used long-term live-cell imaging to determine the fate
of spontaneously arising or experimentally induced MN in a variety of cell lines
(Supplementary Table 1). Imaging analysis revealed that the vast majority of MN (525/541;
97%) are stably maintained during interphase. Although MN may be extruded in some
cells11, extrusion was not detected in our imaging experiments. Furthermore, MN were not
visibly degraded11, did not co-localize with lysosomes (Supplementary Fig. 12), and did not
appear to fuse with the primary nucleus. By contrast, our experiments suggested that after
nuclear envelope breakdown some MN might join the other mitotic chromosomes and be
distributed to daughter nuclei. Of the 331 micronucleated cells that were tracked as they
underwent cell division, 16% (53/331) gave rise to daughters that lacked MN
(Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Movies 1 and 2).
To directly test whether MN reincorporate during mitosis, we generated a U2OS cell line
stably expressing H2B fused to the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede40, which
converts from green to red fluorescence emission after UV illumination. This enabled us to
selectively photoactivate and subsequently track a single chromosome encapsulated in a MN
throughout mitosis (Fig. 5j, Supplementary Movies 3 and 4). This experiment demonstrated
that chromosomes within MN reincorporate into daughter nuclei at a significant frequency
(11/29; 38%). The remaining MN persisted in cells well into the second generation.

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Together, our findings suggest a novel mechanism by which whole chromosome segregation
errors can cause chromosome breaks and potentially cancer-causing mutations. Mitotic
errors can lead to lagging chromosomes which in turn can be partitioned into MN13. This
can produce DNA damage in two ways. First, DNA damage can result as a direct
consequence of aberrant DNA replication, potentially due to a reduced density of replication
origins. Second, chromosome pulverization due to premature chromosome compaction can
occur if a micronucleated cell enters mitosis with MN still undergoing DNA replication.
This may not be the only mechanism by which whole chromosome mis-segregation can
cause DNA damage, as it was recently proposed that lagging chromosomes can be damaged
by the cytokinetic furrow41. In contrast to previous studies that have suggested that most
MN are inactive, discarded or degraded11, we find that MN persist over several generations
but that the chromosomes within the MN can be segregated at a significant frequency into
daughter cell nuclei. Thus, DNA rearrangements and mutations acquired in MN could be
incorporated into the genome of a developing cancer cell.
Our experiments suggest a mechanism that could explain the recently discovered
phenomenon of chromothripsis42,43. Chromothripsis was discovered by cancer genome
sequencing and DNA copy number analysis42. It is defined by small-scale DNA copy
number changes and extensive intrachromosomal rearrangements that are restricted to a
single chromosome or chromosome arm. Two non-exclusive models have been proposed for
chromothripsis: (1) fragmentation of a chromosome followed by stitching together of the

resulting fragments by non-homologous end joining42 and (2) aberrant DNA replication
resulting in fork stalling and template switching or microhomology-mediated break-induced
replication43,44. Partitioning of a chromosome into a spatially isolated MN can explain why
a single chromosome would be subject to aberrant DNA replication and can explain how
extensive DNA damage can be restricted to a single chromosome. Because MN may persist
as discrete entities over multiple generations, damage to the chromosome need not occur all
at once42,43, but could accrue from multiple failed attempts at DNA replication.
Chromothripsis restricted to a chromosome arm could be generated from acentric
chromosome fragments, since chromosome pulverization was previously correlated with the
presence of MN in cancer cell lines after DNA damage35,45. Although chromothripsis
appears to be relatively rare, DNA damage in MN could be more common. We suggest that
chromothripisis may be an extreme outcome of a mutagenesis mechanism that could be
widespread in human cancer.

Methods Summary
All cell lines were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 atmosphere. To generate MN, cells
were treated with nocodazole (100 ng ml-1) for 6 h followed by mitotic shake-off and
nocodazole washout. Alternatively, MN were generated by depletion of MCAK or Nuf2 by
siRNA. MN were also generated in HT1080 cells by inactivation of the kinetochore of the
human artificial chromosome by washout of doxycycline. Detailed descriptions of
immunofluorescence, RNAi, BrdU labelling, comet assays, inactivation of the human

All cell lines were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 atmosphere in DMEM (U20S,

10% FBS, 100 IUml-1 penicillin and 100 μg ml-1 streptomycin. HT1080 cells bearing the
alphoidtetO human artificial chromosome and expressing the tetracycline repressor TetR
fused to the transcriptional silencer tTS (a gift from Vladimir Larionov) were also
supplemented with 1 μg ml-1 doxycycline (Sigma), 0.5 mg ml-1 G418 (geneticin, Invitrogen)
and 4 μg ml-1 blasticidin S (Invitrogen). U2OS cells stably expressing human NFATc1 fused
to the C-terminus of EGFP (Thermo Scientific; R04-017-01) were supplemented with 0.5

Generation of Whole-Chromosome Micronuclei
To generate cells with whole-chromosome MN, hTERT RPE-1 and U2OS cells were treated
with 100 ng ml-1 nocodazole (Sigma) for 6 h. Mitotic cells were collected, washed twice
with fresh medium containing 10% FBS, and then plated into medium containing 20% FBS

arrest associated with nocodazole washout experiments, RPE-1 cells were transfected with
50 nmol p53 siRNA (Smartpool, Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine RNAi Max (Invitrogen)
12 h prior to the nocodazole treatment, enabling cell cycle progression of the subsequent
aneuploid daughter cells with MN. For Nuf2 and MCAK knockdown, U2OS cells were
serum starved for two days prior to transfection with 50 nmol Nuf2 or MCAK siRNAs
(Smartpool, Dharmacon). Cells were then washed in fresh medium containing 10% FBS and
24 h later treated with 4 μM dihydrocytochalasin B (DCB; Sigma) for 16 h to inhibit
cytokinesis. The subsequent arrested tetraploid cells depleted of Nuf2 or MCAK (many of
which harbored MN) were then treated for 6 h with 10 μM SB203580 (Sigma), a p38
inhibitor that promotes cell cycle progression of tetraploids. Sequence information of the

Generation of Micronuclei Containing the Human Artificial Chromosome (HAC)

Author Manuscript

HT1080 cells carrying the HAC were cultured in doxycycline-free medium and treated with
100 ng ml -1 nocodazole for 6 h to synchronize cells in mitosis. The absence of doxycycline
enables TetR binding to TetO, which induces inactivation of the HAC centromere by tTS
and the subsequent formation of a MN following release from mitotic arrest. Cells released
from mitotic arrest were synchronized at G0/G1 by serum starvation for 24 h, then released
into the cell cycle with fresh medium containing 10% serum for further analysis.
Flow Cytometry
Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol at 4° C followed by incubation with 250 μg ml -1 RNase
A and 10 μg ml -1 propidium iodide at 37 °C for 30 min. FACS analysis was performed with
a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and data analysed with CellQuest
software.
Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy

For most experiments, cells were seeded on glass coverslips, washed in CSK buffer (10 mM
PIPES, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3mM MgCl2), pre-extracted with CSK buffer
containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 4° C, and fixed in PBS containing 4%
paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After fixation, cells were permeabilised in PBS-0.2% Triton
X-100 for 5 min, blocked in blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% FBS, 2% BSA and 0.1%
Triton X-100) for 30 min, and then incubated with primary antibodies at room temperature
for 1 h or overnight at 4° C. Cells were washed with PBS-0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated
with fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000, Molecular Probes) at room

temperature for 1 h. Cells were also stained for DNA with Hoechst 33342 (1:5000,
Invitrogen) in PBS. More specific immunostaining protocols were as follows: for γ-H2AX
and other DNA damage response proteins56; for ELYS and mAb41457; for Cyclin B1/γH2AX/BrdU58 and for Mcm2, Cdt1 and Orc259. Images for most experiments were
collected with a Yokogawa CSU-22 spinning disk confocal mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert
microscope using 488, 561 and 640 nm laser light. A series of 0.3 μm optical sections were
acquired using a 100X 1.4 NA Plan Apo objective with an Orca ER CCD camera
(Hamamatsu Photonics). For nuclear pore quantitation, images were collected on a Leica
SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 405 nm laser and a white light laser tuned to
488 nm, 568 nm, and 647 nm using a 63X 1.4 NA Plan Apo objective. Z-stacks were
collected with a 0.3 μm step size with pinhole at 1 Airy unit. Photomultipliers were
calibrated to ensure linear range. For quantitation of Mcm2 and BrdU signals, mean
fluorescence intensity within the primary nuclei or micronuclei was measured using ImageJ
software. For quantitation of γ-H2AX, primary nuclei were classified as positive when five
or more foci were detected, with the threshold of foci intensity set against the irradiated
sample. The same threshold was applied to score γ-H2AX foci in MN. Acquisition
parameters, shutters, filter positions and focus were controlled by Slidebook software
(Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). Images presented in figures are maximum
intensity projections of entire z-stacks, unless otherwise stated.

Long-term live-cell imaging

Author Manuscript

Labelled cells were grown on glass-bottom 12-well tissue culture dishes (Mattek) and
imaged on either a Nikon TE2000-E2 or Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope. Both microscopes
were equipped with a cooled CCD camera (TE2000, Orca ER, Hamamatsu; Ti-E, Coolsnap
HQ2, Photometrics), a precision motorized stage (Bioprecision, Ludl), and Nikon Perfect
Focus, and both were enclosed within temperature and CO2-controlled environments that
maintained an atmosphere of 37° C and 3-5% humidified CO2. GFP or RFP images were
captured at multiple points every 5-10 minutes for 3-5 days with either 10X (0.3 NA) or 20X
(0.5, 0.75 NA) objectives, and exposure to fluorescent light was minimized to the greatest
extent possible (all image acquisition utilized neutral density filters and/or 2×2 binning).
Cell viability was confirmed by the continuous observation of mitotic cells throughout the
duration of experiments. Captured images from each experiment were analyzed using NISElements software.
Imaging of H2B-Kaede

Author Manuscript

Tandem repeats of Kaede (a kind gift of Atsushi Miyawaki, RIKEN Institute) were fused to
H2B and cloned into the pLenti6/V5 lentiviral vector (Invitrogen). A U2OS cell line stably
expressing H2B-Kaede was generated by lentiviral infection followed by repeated FACS
sorting of GFP-positive cells. For tracking experiments, pre-converted micronuclei (GFPpositive) were identified and photoconverted with a brief (1-3s) pulse of 350-400 nm UV
light from a DAPI filter cube. Micronuclei that efficiently converted (RFP-positive) were
subsequently imaged through the completion of the following mitosis using the same
microscope setup as described above. Images were acquired every 10 minutes with a 20X
objective and 2×2 binning.
Chromosome Spreads/Spectral Karyotyping

Author Manuscript

RPE-1 cells were treated with p53 siRNA (as previously described) for 16 h and then grown
in medium supplemented with nocodazole (100 ng ml-1) or vehicle control (DMSO) for 6 h.
Mitotic cells were collected by shake-off, washed thoroughly in fresh medium without
nocodazole, and re-plated in culture medium with 20% FBS to complete mitosis. FACS
analysis demonstrated that the subsequent daughter cells progressed to S/G2-phase 18-20 h
post-release. At this point, interphase samples were collected and fixed in order to observe
the fraction of cells containing MN. In parallel, 100 ng ml-1 colcemid (Invitrogen) was
added to the DMSO or nocodazole-treated cells for an additional 6 h and then fixed. All
samples were similarly processed for fixation: cells were pelleted and resuspended in a
hypotonic solution of 0.075 M KCL for 18 min, fixed in Carnoy’s fixative (3:1
methanol:glacial acetic acid) and washed four times with Carnoy’s fixative. All fixed
samples were spread on slides for staining or hybridisation. Mitotic samples were stained
with Giemsa or Hoechst to visualize chromosomal abnormalities. Spectral karyotyping
(SKY) was performed on interphase and mitotic samples (from both DMSO and nocodazole
treated samples) according to the SkyPaint™ DNA kit H-5 for human chromosomes

procedure (Applied Spectral Imaging, SKY000029) and imaged on a Nikon Eclipse E6000
microscope equipped with the SD300 Spectracube and Spectral Imaging acquisition
software. To determine if pulverized chromosomes were derived from late-replicating
chromosomes in MN, the above procedure was also performed with addition of BrdU
labeling reagent (Roche Applied Science) only in the last two hours of colcemid treatment
before fixation. Mitotic samples from the BrdU samples were treated according to the 5Bromo-2’-deoxy-uridine Labeling and Detection Kit I protocol (Roche Applied Science,
11296736001), except that the anti-BrdU antibody was diluted 1:50.
Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (Comet) Assay

Author Manuscript

Single cell comet assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Trevigen). Briefly, U2OS cells were harvested at G1, S and G2 phases of the cell cycle after
nocodazole washout was used to induce MN. As controls, G1 cells were irradiated at 10 Gy.
Cells were resuspended in cold PBS at 2×105 cells ml-1, mixed with low-melt agarose (1:10
ratio) and spread on frosted glass slides. After the agarose solidified, the slides were
sequentially placed in lysis and alkaline solutions (Trevigen). Slides were then subjected to
electrophoresis at 12 V for 10 min in 1x TBE buffer, fixed with 70% ethanol, and stained
with DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Nuclei were visualized using epifluorescent
illumination on a Zeiss microscope and images were analyzed with the NIH Image J
program. DNA damage was quantified for 50 cells with MN for each experimental condition
by determining the tail DNA percentage using Comet Score (TriTek) software.
Quantitative Analysis of Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs)

Author Manuscript

To determine nuclear pore complex density in primary nuclei and MN, cells were preextracted, fixed, permeabilised and immunostained with mAb414 and ELYS antibodies.
Confocal images were collected on a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal with both a 405 nm
and white light laser (at 488nm and 568nm) using a 63X Plan Apo 1.4 NA oil objective. Zstacks were collected with a 0.3 μm step size with pinhole at 1 Airy unit. Photomultipliers
were calibrated to ensure linear range. Single layers of the Z-stack showing optimal nuclear
pore staining for the primary nucleus and the MN were chosen for quantitative analysis
using MetaMorph. The areas of primary nuclei and MN were judged from Hoechst staining
and used to determine the perinuclear rim area. Total fluorescence intensity of mAb414 and
ELYS was measured in the perinuclear rim area. To compare nuclear pore densities between
primary nuclei and MN, the total nuclear pore fluorescence was divided by the perinuclear
rim area of primary nuclei and MN, resulting in an average intensity ratio.
Nuclear Import

Author Manuscript

To measure nuclear import, we used U2OS cells stably expressing the fusion protein
NFATc1-EGFP (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). The inactive transcription factor NFATc1
resides in the cytosol. Elevated calcium levels in the cytosol lead to the dephosphorylation
of NFATc1 by calcineurin thereby inducing its rapid translocation into the nucleus. To
increase the calcium level in the cytoplasm, U2OS cells released from nocodazole washout
were treated with 0.2 μM thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum
Ca2+ ATPase. Nuclear import of NFATc1 was then measured in the primary nuclei and MN
of U2OS cells at both 6 h and 20 h after nocodazole release. Cells were subsequently fixed

with 2% paraformaldehyde and import was quantified based on nuclear fluorescence. To
measure nuclear import of IBB-DiHcRed60, U2OS cells were transiently transfected with
the IBB-DiHcRed-plasmid (gift from Jan Ellenberg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Cells were then synchronized for 10 h with nocodazole, washed as previously described, and
released into the cell cycle. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde both 6 h and 20 h
later, and import was quantified based on nuclear fluorescence.
