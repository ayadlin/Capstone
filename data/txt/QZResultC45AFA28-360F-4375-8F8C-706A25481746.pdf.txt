Abstract
We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
to compare the efficacy of several intravesical chemotherapeutic (IVC) agents after
transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURB) in non-muscle invasive bladder
cancer patients. The literature search was conducted using the Embase, Scopus and
PubMed databases for RCTs, including patients with single or multiple, primary or
recurrent stage Ta or T1 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder managed with a single,
immediate instillation of IVC after TURB. Thirteen RCTs met the eligibility criteria.
Pair-wise meta-analysis (direct comparison) showed that pirarubicin [hazard ratio
(HR): 0.31], epirubicin (HR: 0.62), and MMC (HR: 0.40) were the most effective drugs
for reducing tumor recurrence. Bayesian network meta-analysis (indirect comparison)
revealed that treatment with pirarubicin (HR: 0.31), MMC (HR: 0.44), or epirubicin
(HR: 0.60) was associated with prolonged recurrence-free survival. Among the drugs
examined, only pirarubicin reduced disease progression compared to controls. These
results suggest that a single, immediate administration of IVC with pirarubicin, MMC,
or epirubicin is associated with prolonged recurrence-free survival following TURB in
non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients, though only pirarubicin also reduced
disease progression.

Introduction

(EAU) and American Urological Association (AUA)
guidelines, respectively [3, 4].
Despite accumulating evidence that post-TUR IVC
instillation reduces disease recurrence, many clinicians
are still reluctant to apply this intervention in patients with
NMIBC due to the cost, postoperative care requirements,
and unexpected side effects, such as irritative lower urinary
tract symptoms, rare hypersensitivity reactions, and
extravasation of IVC agents [5, 6]. Moreover, although there
are various chemotherapeutic agents for IVC, including
mitomycin C (MMC), epirubicin, and gemcitabine, there
is currently no consensus regarding which agent produces
the best oncological outcomes. Previous studies have
primarily focused on the clinical benefits of postoperative
IVC in general rather than comparing outcomes associated
with different drugs. Various IVC agents may have differing
effects on oncological outcomes in NMIBC patients
who receive a single, immediate administration regimen
following TURB.

Bladder cancer, the incidence of which has increased
over the last decade, is the fourth most common malignancy
in men and the eighth most common in women, with
429,000 new cases and 165,000 deaths reported worldwide
in 2012; it is also the second most common cause of death
due to urological cancer [1]. Approximately 80% of
patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder initially
present with non-muscle invasive disease. Because nonmuscle invasive bladder cancers (NMIBCs) may recur and
progress to muscle-invasive disease after initial treatment
[2], it is necessary to develop efficient therapeutic strategies
that reduce recurrence and/or progression. Instillation of
intravesical chemotherapy (IVC) is generally recommended
immediately after complete transurethral resection of
bladder tumor (TURB), especially in patients with low- or
intermediate-risk NMIBC or with small-volume, low-grade
Ta NMIBC based on European Association of Urology

To help improve decisions regarding NMIBC
treatments, we sought to determine which chemotherapeutic
agent is most beneficial as a single, immediate postoperative
IVC following TURB by performing a systematic review
and network meta-analysis of updated randomized
controlled trials (RCTs).

multicenter studies (one multinational) [7–9, 12, 13, 16–
19]. Epirubicin was used in five studies [7, 10, 13, 16, 18],
MMC in five studies [9, 11, 14, 15, 19], gemcitabine in
one study [17], pirarubicin in one study [12], and thiotepa
in one study [8]. In four studies, the control group received
an immediate instillation of sterile water or saline after
TURB [7, 14, 17, 18]. In all studies, the instillation was
given within 24 hours after TURB. Study designs were
similar enough to justify aggregating the data for metaanalysis.
Table 2 shows patient population characteristics
from each study [7–19]. This table provides information
on tumor status, number of tumors, clinical stage, and
tumor grade upon study entry. Only Ta tumors were
included in one trial [19], while only G1/G2 tumors were
included in six trials [11, 14–16, 18, 19]. In five trials
[8, 9, 13, 14, 19], only primary patients were eligible,
while in other five trials [7, 11, 14, 15, 19], only patients
with single tumors were enrolled. Patients had tumors less
than 3 cm in five trials [11, 14–16, 19].

Results
Literature search results
Searches yielded 339 potentially relevant studies.
We excluded 326 reports that did not meet eligibility
criteria. Overall, we included 13 RCTs conducted between
1993 and 2011 in the multiple-treatments meta-analysis.
The PRISMA statement flow diagram illustrating the
search strategy is shown in Figure 1.

Overview of included studies
Figure 2 shows the network of eligible comparisons for
the multiple-treatments meta-analysis. Network nodes that
are not well-connected should be interpreted with caution.
Detailed characteristics of all studies included in
the meta-analysis are listed in Table 1 [7–19]. Five were
single-center studies [10, 11, 14, 15, 19] and eight were

Pair-wise meta-analysis
Figure 3 shows the hazard ratios for each direct

trials of epirubicin vs. control (I2 = 9%, p = 0.35), while
large heterogeneity was observed among trials of MMC

vs. control (I2 = 76%, p = 0.002). Because the other
comparisons were based on single trials, heterogeneity
could not be evaluated. Direct comparisons showed that
pirarubicin, epirubicin, and MMC were more effective
than control treatment; the effects of gemcitabine and
thiotepa in other studies were not statistically significant,
as the hazard ratio (HR) 95% (CI) included 1. Funnel
plots showed evidence of asymmetry. Egger and Begg
test results were significant (all p < 0.05) (Supplementary
Figure S1), suggesting possible publication bias.

terms of RFS are summarized in Figure 5, with details
provided in Supplementary Table S1. Pirarubicin and
MMC were most likely to be ranked the best or the second
best, while thiotepa was ranked as the least effective drug.
Bladder cancer progression was reported as a
secondary outcome in ten trials [7,9–12,14–17,19].
Supplementary Figure S3 shows the network of eligible
comparisons for the network meta-analysis. With the
exception of pirarubicin, none of the regimens were
more efficacious than controls in reducing progression
(Supplementary Figure S4). Comparison of the results
from traditional pairwise meta-analysis and network
meta-analysis did not suggest inconsistency between
direct and indirect evidence (Supplementary Figure S5).
Supplementary Figure S6 shows the probability of each
specific regimen having a given rank, with details provided
in Supplementary Table S2. Pirarubicin usually ranked first,
and MMC had a high probability of being ranked second.

Bayesian framework network meta-analysis
A random effects model for a single, immediate
postoperative instillation of chemotherapy was selected
because the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC) for the
random effects model (25.8) was lower than that for the
fixed effects model (31.5). Figure 4 shows the results of
the network meta-analysis. Treatment with epirubicin
(HR: 0.60, 95% credible interval (Crl) 0.37–0.93), MMC
(HR: 0.44, 95% Crl: 0.23–0.68), and pirarubicin
(HR: 0.31, 95% Crl: 0.10–0.92) were associated with
prolonged recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared
with controls. For gemcitabine and thiotepa, 95% Crls
overlapped the null effect line. Comparison of the results
from traditional pairwise meta-analysis and network metaanalysis did not suggest inconsistency between direct and
indirect evidence (Supplementary Figure S2). Rankings of
the six different treatment strategies (including control) in

Discussion
Because recurrence rates after TURB are high in
NMIBC patients, additional treatments are needed; thus,
both EAU and AUA guidelines currently recommend a
single, immediate instillation of IVC following TURB
in these patients. However, despite promising results in
previous RCTs and in our meta-analysis of single-dose
IVC in NMIBC patients, its use remains controversial,
and post-TUR IVC is often underutilized [5, 20]. For

example, Schwartz and colleagues found that postTUR IVC was administered in only 33–43% of NMIBC
patients in European countries [21]. Furthermore, the lack
of comparative studies makes it difficult for clinicians to
choose the most beneficial agents.
We performed a network meta-analysis to identify
the most effective IVC agent for reducing recurrence and

progression after TURB in NMIBC patients. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first network meta-analysis
based on a Bayesian random effects model focusing
primarily on comparing IVC agent efficacy in NMIBC
patients undergoing TURB. This statistical technique was
developed to compare the relative efficacies of different
treatment strategies indirectly when these treatments

have not been specifically compared in individual trials
[22]. Thus, our network meta-analysis may help assess
the efficacy of different IVC agents which have not been
compared to each other previously, but which have been
compared to similar controls, such as a placebo group.
Notably, our traditional pairwise meta-analysis
and network meta-analysis showed that post-TUR IVC
instillation was associated with lower rates of bladder
tumor recurrence compared to controls. Similarly, De
Nunzio et al. [23] found that a single, early IVC instillation
of mitomycin C reduced the risk of tumor recurrence in
low-risk NMIBC. Gudjonsson et al. [24] also showed
that a single, post-TUR instillation of epirubicin was
associated with reduced disease recurrence in 305 NMIBC
patients with low- to intermediate-risk bladder tumors.
Moreover, Sylvester et al. [25] performed the first metaanalysis of this treatment and noted that postoperative
IVC resulted in a 11.7% absolute reduction, and a 24.2%
relative reduction, in recurrence compared to TUR alone
(HR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49–0.75) in NMIBC patients. The
same group recently reported that a single instillation
of post-TUR IVC reduced the relative risk of disease
recurrence by 35% (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.58–0.74) and
decreased the 5-year recurrence rate from 58.8% to 44.8%
[26]. In their evaluation of 18 RCTs that included 3,103
NMIBC patients, Abern and colleagues demonstrated that
a single dose of IVC received within 24 hours of resection
was associated with a 13% absolute reduction in the risk
of tumor recurrence [27].
Conversely, Bohle et al. [17] showed that NMIBC
patients who received a single, immediate instillation of
gemcitabine after TURB had recurrence-free survival
rates similar to placebo group patients. Additionally,
Berrum and colleagues found that small recurrences
prevented by a single instillation of epirubicin could

easily be fulgurated in outpatient clinics, indicating that
the clinical benefit of post-TUR IVC may be limited [16].
Holmang also suggested that there was no evidence that
a single, immediate instillation of IVC after TURB had
a beneficial impact on progression and quality of life,
although it reduced recurrences of harmless and small
tumors compared to TUR alone [28]. Therefore, findings
regarding the clinical benefits of a single, immediate
postoperative IVC are conflicted.
The other key finding of the present study is the
identification of epirubicin (HR: 0.60), MMC (HR: 0.44),
and pirarubicin (HR: 0.31) as the most effective IVC
agents among those examined, whereas gemcitabine and
thiotepa were ineffective in reducing disease recurrence.
Recently, in an updated meta-analysis that included
13 RCTs published before 2013, Perlis and colleagues
evaluated recurrence-free intervals following treatment
with different IVC drugs after TUR. They found that
treatment with both MMC (HR: 0.49) and epirubicin (HR:
0.65) were associated with longer recurrence-free interval.
Therefore, epirubicin and MMC may be the most effective
IVC agents for reducing disease recurrence after TURB,
while gemcitabine and thiotepa, which may be relatively
ineffective, require further investigation. The recent
Cochrane review by Shelley et al. also indicated that a
single instillation of gemcitabine following TURB was no
more effective than placebo in reducing tumor recurrence
[29].
Interestingly, only treatment with pirarubicin was
associated with reduced disease progression rates; other
IVC regimens were no more effective than controls
in preventing progression. However, bladder cancer
progression was a rare event in the pirarubicin trial,
occurring in only 1.5% of controls (1 of 66) and in 0%
of patients receiving pirarubicin (0 of 68). Therefore,

conclusions drawn from this analysis should be considered
with caution.
Several limitations of this study should be addressed
in future research. First, as in other meta-analyses, unknown
or uncontrolled variables in the included trials affect
the results of the current study. Short follow-up periods,
inadequate sample sizes, and non-generalizable populations
are common limitations of RCTs. Second, network metaanalysis requires combining evidence from studies with
markedly different designs [30]. For example, Stettler et
al. [31] conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the
clinical outcomes of drug-eluting and bare-metal stents in
patients with coronary artery disease. However, eligibility
criteria for percutaneous coronary intervention and the
definition of myocardial infarction were not consistent
across the included trials. Third, because the current metaanalysis was based on a random effects model, smaller
studies may have disproportionately affected our results
[32]. Finally, although we demonstrated that post-TUR
IVC agents have different efficacies in NMIBC patients
following TURB, the potential mechanisms responsible
for these differences remain unknown. Nevertheless, these
results merit consideration, especially considering that
publication bias and heterogeneity between the included
studies, which are crucial problems for traditional metaanalyses, were not significant.
In summary, our meta-analysis showed that a single,
immediate IVC treatment with pirarubicin, MMC, or
epirubicin after TURB was associated with prolonged RFS
in NMIBC patients. In contrast, gemcitabine and thiotepa
did not reduce disease recurrence compared to controls.
However, among the drugs examined, only pirarubicin
was effective in preventing disease prevention compared
to controls. Although larger RCTs comparing these agents
are required in order to provide more direct evidence, our
study may aid in the selection of the most appropriate IVC
agent following TURB in NMIBC patients.

We determined study eligibility according to
predefined selection criteria [33]. Prospective RCTs
involving patients with single or multiple, primary or
recurrent stage Ta or T1 urothelial carcinoma of the
bladder managed with a single, immediate instillation of
chemotherapy after TURB were included. Patients who
were treated with TURB alone or placebo instillation after
TURB served as comparators. Disease recurrence was
the primary endpoint and progression was the secondary
endpoint. Studies that were not randomized or prospective
in their design were excluded from the analysis.
Studies involving patients with non-urothelial
carcinoma (e.g, squamous, adenocarcinoma) or
alternative routes of administration (i.e., intravenous, oral,
intramuscular injection) were also excluded. Additionally,
studies that did not use controls or that used historical
controls were excluded, as were studies in which the
outcomes of interest were not reported or were impossible
to calculate based on the published results. When reports
overlapped or there were duplicates, we retained the data
with the longest follow-up period.

Data extraction and synthesis
Two reviewers (CK and HHK) performed all data
extraction, including study characteristics and outcome
data. For each study included in the network metaanalysis, the following information was extracted: name
of the first author, year of publication, geographic location,
period of recruitment, sample size (randomized patients,
total and per arm), median age, percentage of patients who
showed recurrence and/or progression, and chemotherapy
regimen and dosage delivered. Discrepancies were
discussed until consensus was reached.

Data synthesis

Materials and methods

To assess the relative effectiveness of each
treatment, placebo or TURB alone were considered the
reference treatments for direct and indirect analyses,
respectively. All treatments using a given drug were
considered together, regardless of differences in dosage
schemes among studies.
The efficacy of a single, immediate instillation
of chemotherapy after TURB was compared to TURB
alone with respect to the primary endpoint (recurrence)
and the secondary endpoint (progression). For time-toevent comparisons, the starting point was the date of
randomization.

Search strategy
This review was carried out according to the
PRISMA statement [33]. A literature search was performed
using Embase, Scopus, and PubMed databases for all
RCTs published prior to December 31, 2015. Keywords
used were “randomized clinical trial”, “bladder cancer”,
“single”, and “intravesical”. In addition to searching the
databases, the reference lists of all included studies, metaanalyses, and reviews were manually searched.
The search was restricted to studies published in
English. Two investigators (MK and CWJ) independently
reviewed the titles, abstracts, and studies to establish
whether they met the inclusion criteria. Conflicts between
reviewers were resolved by consensus.

each chemotherapy regimen on outcomes. When HRs
and 95% CIs were not available, they were approximated
using the methods described by Parmar et al. [34]; we
imputed HR and its variance using the number of events
(E1, E2) and randomized patients (T1, T2) in each arm and
the presented log-rank p value. We estimated the variance
of the log(HR) using the formula (T1+T2)2/[(E1+E2)T1T2]
and then estimated the natural logarithm of the HR such
that the p value matched that of the log-rank test.
When two or more studies comparing the same
regimen were available, a direct meta-analysis was
performed using the DerSimonian and Laird random
effects model [35]. Exchangeability was assessed
by examining heterogeneity in each head-to-head
comparison. Between-study heterogeneity was estimated
by using the I2 statistic; typically, values above 50%
indicate high heterogeneity, values from 25–50% indicate
moderate heterogeneity, and values below 25% indicate
low heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed by
visual inspection of funnel plots as well as with the Egger
linear regression test and the Begg rank correlation test.
Since data on adverse effects were analyzed in previously
published meta-analyses [26, 27, 36], adverse effects were
not examined in this analysis.
We performed a network meta-analysis using a
random-effects model. Model parameters were estimated
using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method called Gibbs
sampling, as implemented in WinBUGS 1.4 (MRC
Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge, UK) [37]. The selection
of a fixed or random effects model for reported outcomes
was based on the model fit criteria (Deviance Information
Criteria, DIC), which penalizes greater model complexity
[22]. Each analysis was based on non-informative priors
for effect sizes and precision. To avoid potential selection
bias, we incorporated all data presentations in a single
analysis using the methods described by Woods et al.
[38]. The median of the posterior distribution was used as
a point estimate of treatment effect. Effect sizes together
with 95% credible intervals (Crls) were used to make
different comparisons across studies. In the presence of
minimally informative priors, Crls can be interpreted
similarly to conventional CIs.
We also examined inconsistency between direct
and indirect estimates using a modified back-calculation
approach [39]. The quality of the models was examined
by inspecting convergence using Gelman-Rubin-Brooks
plots, assessing autocorrelation between iterations of the
Markov chain, and determining whether the MC error was
less than 5% of the posterior standard deviation.
Version 5.0 RevMan statistical software (The
Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen) was employed for
the direct meta-analysis. Bayesian framework analyses
were performed in R 3.2.2 (R development Core Team,
Vienna, http://www.R-project.org) with the GeMTC
package. A p value less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Unless otherwise stated, all
p values were two-sided.
