BACKGROUND. Colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (CT) are
likely to experience multiple concurrent toxicities that, rather than appearing singularly, may be associated with one another. Graphic and tabular representations
of distance matrices were used to identify associations between toxicities and to
define the strengths of these relations.

METHODS. Using a standardized data collection tool, electronic medical charts of

line demographic and clinical information. Treatment-related toxicities were
recorded using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria during the

RESULTS. The graphic analysis, in which associations between toxicities were represented as links, identified 6 major hubs (fever, dehydration, fatigue, anorexia,
pain, and weight loss), defined as central nodes with more connections than
expected by chance. These were highly linked with minor nodes and provided
evidence suggesting the existence of symptom clusters associated with CTinduced toxicities.

CONCLUSIONS. The application of distance matrix analyses to define CT-induced
toxicity associations is new. The technique was effective in defining the global
landscape of the binary relations among toxicities associated with Cycle 1 therapy.
The coherent clinical picture emerging from the network provides a strong suggestion that the toxicities in each cluster share a common pathobiologic basis, which
may provide an opportunity for intervention. These findings could become useful
for the early prediction of co-occurring toxicities and, in the future, as a phenotyping framework for the pharmacogenomic analysis of individual responses to
chemotherapy. Cancer 2008;112:284–92.  2007 American Cancer Society.

reatment-related toxicities are common among patients being
treated with cancer chemotherapy. Not only do toxicities create
pain and distress, they also adversely impact quality of life and
patient tolerance of cancer treatment.1,2 Many contribute either
directly or indirectly to increased morbidity or mortality. Furthermore, they are significant drivers of healthcare costs by increasing
the need for supportive care.3,4 Despite an awareness that toxicities
rarely occur independent of each other, the majority of research in
supportive cancer care has focused only on individual symptoms,
such as fatigue,5 mucositis,6 anxiety or alopecia,7 nausea/vomiting,8

hematologic toxicity,9 or pain.10 This paradigm is
currently shifting to the study of symptom clusters,11–13 most of which have been defined using
conventional hierarchical analysis.
Clustering symptom distress is now recognized
as important and measurable in cancer patients. The
scale developed at the University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center14 and validated in many
countries and patient populations has been used to
document the nature and frequency of symptom
clusters. In a retrospective review of 1000 cancer
patients admitted for palliative care, each patient
was reported to have a median of 11 symptoms,15
whereas other series reported a median of 13 symptoms.16 In many cases, the analyses of symptoms
have been performed in patients well beyond the
completion of their treatment, and have been attributed to the chronic effects of their disease burden.
In contrast, chemotherapy-induced toxicity
symptoms would be expected to be more acute and
to occur within days or weeks of the administration
of drug, as well as be mechanistically attributable to
the induction of biologic pathways that result in
direct tissue injury (as in mucositis) or the secondary
effects of increased levels of mediators such as
proinflammatory cytokines (fatigue). Alternatively, it
is conceivable that the products of tumor cell
destruction are themselves capable of inducing
inflammatory pathways and thereby indirectly evoking symptoms. Clues to the common mechanistic
underpinnings of toxicities could be better defined
by studying the patterns and groupings in which
toxicities occur.
To our knowledge, relatively little has been published to date regarding toxicity complexes among
patients being treated for colorectal cancer. Studies
have mainly focused on cancer-associated symptoms, rather than those specifically associated with
treatment.
The current study was designed to define relations between chemotherapy-induced toxicities
reported in colorectal cancer patients using a novel
approach that may be less confining and more comprehensive than conventional hierarchical analysis.
We developed a graphic and tabular model based on
distance matrices in which nodes represent random
variables and arcs or arrows define stochastic dependencies quantified by probability distributions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Population and Data Collection
To assess the correlations between treatment-related
toxicities, we performed a retrospective medical re-

285

cord review of consecutive patients undergoing treatment with chemotherapy for colorectal cancer at the
Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.
The local Institutional Review Board reviewed and
approved the protocol and the study was conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
An initial study cohort of predetermined size
(n 5 800) was identified by a comprehensive computer search of all patients with International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes for colorectal
cancer treated at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.
From the initial population, 300 patients were enrolled in the analysis in reverse chronologic order,
starting from December 31, 2005 and proceeding
backward in time until target enrollment was
achieved. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they
were age 18 years at the time of diagnosis, had a
pathology-confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer,
and if they underwent at least 1 cycle of conventional chemotherapy.
A standardized data collection tool was developed to record demographic data, habits, clinical
and tumor characteristics, and treatment-related
information. Toxicities were defined by standard
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(NCI CTC; version 2.0 or 3.0) and recorded as being
present if a grade of 1 was noted in the medical
record at any time during the first treatment cycle.

Construction of the Distance Matrix Network
To assess binary relations we used a network of associations that was constructed by comparing, for each
pair of toxicities, the probability p(A $ B | D) that
the 2 toxicities A and B are associated given the data
D with the probability p(A \ B | D) that the 2 toxicities are independent given the data. The probabilities
p(A $ B | D) and p(A \ B | D) are proportional to the
probabilities of the data given the model of association, p(D | A $ B) and p(D | A \ B), respectively,
known as marginal likelihoods and, for the case of a
discrete variable, it is computed in closed form. In
this study, the marginal likelihood was corrected by
the standard penalty for model complexity known as
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
The measure of strength of association between
2 toxicities in this article is known as Bayes Factor
and it is computed as the ratio between the model of
association and the model of independence:
BF ¼

pðA $ B j DÞ
pðA?B j DÞ

which represents how many times the model of association is more probable than the model of inde-

RESULTS
Of the 300 consecutive colorectal cancer patients
included in this review, the majority received chemotherapy with palliative intent for the treatment of
advanced disease. The demographic characteristics
of the study population are summarized in Table 1.

Approximately half the patients were female. The overwhelming majority were white and age > 45 years,
although the mean age at diagnosis was younger than
is usually reported. Nearly half of the patients were
past or present smokers and approximately 25% were
regular or heavy alcohol drinkers. Approximately 40%
of patients had at least 1 comorbidity, of which hypertension was the most common. Thirty-six patients
(12%) had a history of diabetes mellitus.
With respect to disease setting, 103 patients
(34%) were treated with adjuvant intent for high-risk
stage II or stage III disease and the remaining 197
(66%) were treated for stage IV metastatic disease for
palliation (graded according to the Tumor, Node, Metastasis Staging System, 5th and 6th edition). Patients
received 1 of 3 primary treatment regimens: an oxaliplatin-based regimen (in which the platinum compound was either given with continuous infusion of
5-fluorouracil [5-FU] or with capecitabine), an irinotecan-based regimen (in which irinotecan was given
in association with either intravenous 5-FU or capecitabine), or monotherapy with 5-FU (either oral or
by infusion). Although some patients also received
an antiangiogeneic agent (bevacizumab) or an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (either cetuximab or erlotinib), the number was small because
these drugs were in limited use, exclusive of clinical
trials, before 2004.

Toxicities
Greater than 96% of study patients experienced at
least 1 type of toxicity during their first cycle of
chemotherapy and most patients experienced more
than 2 different toxicities (Table 2). Regardless of the
grade, only 20% of the study population reported 2
toxicities. Remarkably, > 6 toxicities were noted in
approximately one-third of the subjects.
Toxicities were reported by NCI CTC criteria and,
for the purpose of this study, placed into 83 categories based on patient reporting during and at the
conclusion of Cycle 1 (Table 2). All patients received
their planned Cycle 1 treatment. Three were compelled to discontinue subsequent treatment because
of toxicity. There were no toxicity-related deaths.
Fourteen patients (5.3%) had toxicity-associated hospitalizations during or immediately after Cycle 1 due
to infection with febrile neutropenia and/or gastrointestinal toxicity (nausea, diarrhea, and/or vomiting)
combined with dehydration. The median duration of
hospitalization was 3 days (range, 1–14 days).
From the original platform of 83 different toxicities, we selected for analysis those (n 5 25) that
occurred with a frequency of at least 5% (Table 3).
The most frequently reported toxicities were nausea

When we incorporated possible clinical risk factors into the model, no associations were found
between reported toxicities and patient sex, age,
race, comorbidities, or habits (Table 3). However, we
noted a correlation (P < .05) between the develop-

ment of specific toxicities and the type of chemotherapy. For example, all patients (n 5 67) who
developed sensory neurotoxicity received an oxaliplatin-based regimen, and the same treatment was
more frequently associated with the development of
pain than the irinotecan-based regimen or monochemotherapy.

dehydration, fatigue, anorexia, pain, and weight loss.
Each major node was connected to at least 2 other
major nodes, with the exception of pain, which was
connected with fatigue only. In agreement with other
work,18,19 we found a strong association between fatigue and pain.
We also found consecutive associations between
toxicities. Two groupings clustered around gastrointestinal symptoms: a first cluster consisted of fatigue,
anorexia, dehydration, nausea, and vomiting; a second linked anorexia and dehydration with taste
alteration, mucositis, and dry mouth. A dermatologic
grouping was defined by connections between dry
skin, skin pigmentation/hand-foot syndrome reaction
(HFS), rash, and itching, which was also connected to
wound complication toxicity. Finally, we noticed
strong connections between pulmonary symptoms
such as cough, dyspnea, and infection. Chills, weight
loss, and weakness were all connected with fever.

DISCUSSION
FIGURE 1. Network developed by a Bayesian analytical approach showing
associations between cycle 1 toxicities. Strong links, implying an association
between 2 different toxicities that was at least 7 times more probable than
the possibility that those toxicities were unrelated, are represented as red
lines. Weaker links, defined as the probability of an association between 2
toxicities is 3 to 7 times higher than the probability of their not being associated, is represented by a blue line, and association links of <3 are seen
as green lines.

Using a Bayesian analytical approach, we developed graphs that defined strong and weak toxicity
associations based on probability tests of association
(Fig. 1). A strong link implies that the association
between 2 different toxicities was at least 7 times
more probable than the possibility for those toxicities
to be unrelated, or the possibility of either to be represented as independent. In the same way, a weak
link was defined if the probability of association
between 2 toxicities was between 3 and 7 times
higher than the probability that they are not associated. In the network in Figure 1 associations with a
Bayes factor > 3 but <7 are colored in blue, whereas
associations with a Bayes factor > 7 are colored in
red. The matrix in Figure 2 labels in red the associations with a Bayes factor > 7, with blue the associations between 3 and 7, with green the associations
with a Bayes factor between 1 and 3, and in white
the lack of association.
Using this technique, we defined 6 principal toxicities as major nodes or hubs because they had at
least 5 strong connections with other toxicities: fever,

The basis for, and definition of, toxicity clustering
remains to be elucidated despite the applications of
several analytic approaches. In nononcology settings,
when symptoms have been grouped, it has often
been done intuitively rather then empirically. Physical symptoms are commonly dissociated from cognitive and affective symptoms. Previous studies have
suggested that 3 symptoms, occurring at the same
time, might be considered a cluster,12,20,21 and several studies demonstrated correlations (tight, close,
or frail) between clusters.22,23 There has been growing awareness that common biologic mechanisms
may underlie or contribute to simultaneously
reported symptoms24 and there is clinical evidence
that symptoms grouped in a cluster may share a
common biologic mechanism.25
However, although symptom clusters have been
useful in creating diagnostic criteria for many nonmalignant diseases, the process that leads to symptom cluster definitions in oncology is much more
complicated. In fact, the symptoms reported could
be related to the cancer, to the treatment, to a concomitant illness, or to a combination of these factors.
It is also possible that a symptom causes a cascade
of other symptoms or that an interaction between
key symptoms exists. These relations could lead to
an increasing number of functional disturbances,26
both in the patients receiving chemotherapy treatment and in terminally ill patients.27
Consequently, we reasoned that a comparison of
various treatment-related toxicities at a more interactive level was highly desirable. Effectively, toxicities

are likely to appear, accumulate, peak, and remain or
dissipate at predictable timepoints throughout the
treatment cycle. For this reason, we recorded all toxicities reported by nurses and/or physicians during
the entire cycle. We focused our analysis on the first
treatment cycle to eliminate confounders such as
palliative or therapeutic interventions that might be
introduced in subsequent cycles.
We found a high frequency of reported toxicities.
Fatigue and diarrhea were the most common. Interestingly, we did not find any correlations between
the patients’ demographic factors or comorbidities
and toxicity development. This may be related to the
relatively small number of cases analyzed, because
other studies report that sex and comorbidities may
affect toxicity patterns.28 As expected, we found a
strong correlation between the specific type of toxicity and the chemotherapy regimen given. For example, neurologic symptoms were correlated with
exposure to oxaliplatin, whereas the development of
cutaneous rash or dermatitis was observed in
patients receiving an EGFR-inhibitor. Some of the
clusters have been previously suggested,23 such as a
gastrointestinal and a pulmonary association of
symptoms.
Description of symptom clusters in cancer
patients is not new. Conventional studies used a
Pearson correlation coefficient or standard hierarchi-

cal analysis with a squared Euclidean method to establish the strength of correlations between different
symptoms, or to calculate distances between symptom items.22 The application of a hierarchical analysis describes the correlation of a specific symptom
with another toxicity. A problem with this approach
is that hierarchical clustering clusters toxicities into
a single structure so that each toxicity can be
assigned to 1 cluster only. In contrast, the graphical
approach adopted in this study allows a toxicity to
be shared by several clusters and, in so doing, identifies toxicities that play a central role in connecting
different clusters. In network theory, these highly
connected nodes in the network are termed hubs
and represent a point of contact between alternative
clusters, which would not be identifiable by hierarchical analysis.
Herein, we propose a new method to report
those correlations, utilizing weak and strong linkages
in a Bayesian analytical approach, which offers some
specific advantages, as it defines symptom clustering
in a dynamic, multidimensional, and comprehensive
way that reflects the clinical situation. Rather than
analyze only the closest symptom to a specific toxicity, Bayesian methodology depicts multiple associations and relations among toxicities by the
application of distance matrices. Effectively, the use
of the Bayesian methodology provides the opportu-

Acute Toxicity Associations/Aprile et al.

nity to discover and define patterns of relations
among many concurrent symptoms. Thus, we were
able to find 6 key points defined as major connectors, which were linked to at least 5 other lymph
nodes. The connections between different toxicities,
expressed as a line in the graphs, are not intended to
depict causal relations, even if a bilateral causality is
possible, as the association between toxicities was
interpreted as stochastic variables (either positive or
negative). Nonetheless, it could be hypothesized that
when 2 toxicities are related a causal connection
does exist.
The graphic representation of the network
helped us to identify the existence of interesting consecutive associations among toxicities. Two groups of
toxicities focused on are gastrointestinal toxicities.
The first consisted of fatigue, anorexia, dehydration,
nausea, and vomiting, and the second was comprised of anorexia and dehydration with taste alteration, mucositis, and dry mouth. A dermatologic
grouping of dry skin, skin pigmentation/HFS, rash,
and itching and a pulmonary-focused cluster of
cough, dyspnea, and infection suggest both physiologic and mechanistic commonality. Chills, weight
loss, and weakness were all connected with fever.
It is interesting to note that we noted a lack of
direct associations between some toxicities that have
often been unquestionably linked. For example, we
found that fever and infection do not have an uninterrupted link in our graphic model. Rather, although
correlations between these toxicities are present, the
route from one is not direct. This finding is, in fact,
consistent with the clinical frequency of fever in the
absence of documented infection or neutropenia. In
our study population, of the 42 cases of fever identified in patients’ medical records, only 11 had fever
linked to infection, and 34 had no mention of neutropenia. The nondirectional nature of the network
does not address the issue of a causal dependency
between associated toxicities, but it identifies relations that could be the subject of further, more
detailed analysis, including the determination of
their directionality. It is also possible that some of
the toxicity associations found in our study population might be different for other cancer regimens.
For example, among patients being treated with
radiation therapy for cancers of the head and neck, a
strong, direct link between oral mucositis and pain
would appear inevitable. This raises the question of
the ubiquity of toxicity symptom clusters across different cancer diagnoses and treatments, and implies
that toxicity associations may vary.
The findings of the current study demonstrate
that the application of distance matrices using a

291

Bayesian analytical approach provided a comprehensive picture of toxicity clustering among patients
receiving chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal cancer. This technique provides the opportunity
to define the strength of the associations between
toxicities, which could reflect common biologic
underpinnings. On a clinical level, such a method
may provide a basis for the identification of prophylactic and targeted interventions.
