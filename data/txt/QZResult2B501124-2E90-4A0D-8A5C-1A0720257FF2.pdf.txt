Abstract
Modeling the hematogenous spread of cancer cells to distant organs poses one of the greatest challenges
in the study of human metastasis. Both tumor cell–intrinsic properties as well as interactions with reactive
stromal cells contribute to this process, but identiﬁcation of relevant stromal signals has been hampered
by the lack of models allowing characterization of the metastatic niche. Here, we describe an implantable
bioengineered scaffold, amenable to in vivo imaging, ex vivo manipulation, and serial transplantation for
the continuous study of human metastasis in mice. Orthotopic or systemic inoculation of tagged human
cancer cells into the mouse leads to the release of circulating tumor cells into the vasculature, which seed
the scaffold, initiating a metastatic tumor focus. Mouse stromal cells can be readily recovered and proﬁled,
revealing differential expression of cytokines, such as IL1b, from tumor-bearing versus unseeded scaffolds.
Finally, this platform can be used to test the effect of drugs on suppressing initiation of metastatic lesions.
This generalizable model to study cancer metastasis may thus identify key stromal-derived factors with
important implications for basic and translational cancer research. Cancer Res; 74(24); 7229–38. 2014

Introduction
Despite signiﬁcant advances in targeted therapies
against cancer, metastatic disease remains incurable (1).
Paget's "seed and soil" hypothesis suggests that a receptive
premetastatic microenvironment must evolve in order for
tumor cells to engraft and proliferate at secondary sites (2,
3). Tumor cell–derived factors that enhance or direct
metastasis to speciﬁc organs have been described (4–6).
In contrast, proteins secreted by stromal cells within a
metastatic niche are less readily identiﬁed, in part because
of the difﬁculty in isolating and characterizing such cells
even in mouse models. Such studies are particularly chal-

lenging in prostate and breast cancer, which metastasize
to bone, a site that is not easily accessible for sampling.
A number of stromal-derived survival factors have been
proposed on the basis of in vitro coculture experiments,
although most remain to be validated in vivo (7, 8). No robust
mouse models exist to test for metastasis-enhancing stromal-derived factors on a scale that would allow identiﬁcation of novel pathways and testing of potential therapeutic
suppressors of critical tumor/stromal interactions. Bioengineered scaffolds have been previously employed for the
study of primary tumors (9) and, for bone metastasis in
particular, engineered bone marrow–like structures have
recently been described in the context of hematopoietic
reconstitution (10–12), but their application to generating
and studying blood-borne metastasis have not been extensively explored. Here, we present a bioengineered bone
marrow–modeling scaffold, which can be implanted subcutaneously, monitored in situ through live imaging, and either
serially transplanted in vivo or resected for detailed cellular
and molecular analysis. Hematogenous seeding of the scaffold by orthotopically and systemically introduced tumor
cells recapitulates the initiation of metastasis and allows
molecular characterization of mouse-derived metastasisassociated stromal cells. As a functional validation of this
method, we identify IL1b as a stromal-secreted cytokine that
enhances the initiation of metastasis in two different cancer
models, and whose suppression can be achieved through
systemic administration of a receptor antagonist. Our data
demonstrate the efﬁcacy of a metastasis-capturing device in
uncovering stromal signals and evaluating the effect of their

use and administered daily by intraperitoneal injection at a
concentration of 25 mg/kg.

Materials and Methods

In vitro invasion and proliferation assays
Invasiveness and proliferation of PC-3 cells were assessed according to standard procedures with slight modiﬁcations. Details are provided in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.

All chemicals and supplies were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich or Fisher Scientiﬁc unless otherwise stated. In vivo
studies were performed in accordance with an animal protocol
approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Subcommittee on Research Animal Care.
Scaffold design
Scaffold design and bone marrow stromal cell seeding
density were based on our previous studies that optimized
these parameters (11). Speciﬁcally, we used a polyacrylamide
hydrogel composed of 30% (w/w) acrylamide (monomer) and
5% (w/w) bis-acrylamide (crosslinker). Mechanical property of
hydrogel scaffold measured by dynamic storage modulus was
18.3  6.8 kPa. Cavity and junction diameters were about 250
and 65 mm, respectively. Half a million human bone marrow
stromal cells were seeded per scaffold. Pore dimension and
porosity of scaffolds are comparable with the marrow tissue
formed within trabecular bones, which consist of 300 to 900 mm
cavities. Mechanical stiffness of hydrogel scaffolds is approximately 50 times higher than reported central marrow stiffness
(13). Although decreasing the polymer content of the hydrogel
matrix could further reduce mechanical stiffness, it cannot
support open porous three-dimensional (3D) structure during
cell seeding and after subdermal implantation, which would in
turn cause poor tissue development. Technical details about
scaffold fabrication and 3D culture of primary human bone
marrow stromal cells are provided in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Cancer cell cultures and generation of Luc-GFP stable
cell lines
PC-3 cells (ATCC) were cultured in F-12K Medium (ATCC),
while DU-145 (ATCC) and MDA-231 #1833 (a kind gift by
J. Massague, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New
York, NY) were grown in DMEM (Gibco/Life Technologies),
both supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco/Life Technologies). All cell lines were
obtained in 2011 and immediately expanded and frozen at
early passages. When thawed for experimental use, they were
never passaged for more than 4 months in culture. ATCCderived cell lines were authenticated by the cell bank via
short tandem repeat proﬁling. MDA-231 #1833 cell lines
were validated in our laboratory for KRAS and BRAF mutation by Sanger sequencing. All cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination giving negative results. Stable LucGFP cell lines were generated using high titer lentivirus
(Lenti Luc-GFP) as previously described (14).
Drugs
For in vitro treatments, recombinant human IL1b (PeproTech) and IL1Ra (Anakinra) were resuspended as 100 mg/mL
stocks in DMSO and used at a concentration of 100 ng/mL.
For in vivo experiments, IL1Ra (Anakinra) stock solution
(100 mg/0.67 mL) was freshly diluted in PBS at the moment of

Subdermal scaffold implant, explant, and transplant
Six- to eight-week-old male NOD/SCID/IL2g null (NSG) mice
(Jackson Laboratory) were used for xenograft studies. The
dorsal side of mice was shaved under isoﬂuorane anesthesia.
Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC)-coated scaffolds were
washed with PBS (3 times). After wiping the skin with alcohol
swab, an incision (4 mm) was made to create a subcutaneous
pocket, a scaffold was carefully inserted using forceps and
the incision was closed with surgical staples (Roboz). Four
scaffolds were implanted in each mouse. On the last day of the
study, mice were sacriﬁed and implanted scaffolds were carefully removed. For serial transplant, explanted scaffolds were
subdermally reimplanted as described above.
Xenograft mouse models, bioluminescence imaging,
and in vivo IL1Ra treatment
Four BMSC-coated scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted in the back of each mouse as previously described. Four
weeks later, orthotopic prostate tumors were generated by
injecting 1  106 PC-3 or DU-145 cells into the dorsal prostatic
gland of NSG mice in a volume of 20 mL (1:1 ratio of PBS
and Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix, BD Biosciences).
Similarly, experimental breast cancer metastases were generated by tail vein injection of 1  106 MDA-231 #1833 cells in
the same strain of immunocompromised mice. Animals were
imaged weekly 5 minutes after intraperitoneal injection of
150 mL RediJect D-luciferin Ultra Bioluminescent Substrate
(Caliper Life Sciences) using an IVIS Lumina II platform
(Caliper Life Sciences) with constant settings throughout the
entire experiment. Four or eight weeks later (breast and
prostate cancer model, respectively), mice were sacriﬁced and
scaffolds were explanted for either culture, histologic analysis,
or serial transplantation into syngeneic tumor-free mice. Bone
and visceral metastases were conﬁrmed on dissected organs
immediately after necropsy based on bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and GFP ﬂuorescence. Bioluminescence in recipient
mice was monitored weekly for up to eight more weeks as
described above. For drug treatment, PC-3 tumor-bearing mice
were randomized on the basis of primary tumor size and
treated daily by intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg IL1Ra
or PBS vehicle (4 mice per group) for 2 weeks starting 6 weeks
after establishment of the primary tumor, followed by scaffold
transplantation as above. The investigator performing live
imaging of transplanted mice (experiment readout) was blinded to the group allocation.
Circulating tumor cells capture and enumeration
Before scaffold transplant, PC-3 tumor-bearing mice
were anesthetized to perform cardiocentesis through the

intercostal muscle of the left chest and approximately 1 mL of
blood was drawn into a syringe primed with 100 mL of PBS
with 10 mmol/L EDTA pH 7.4 (Gibco). Circulating tumor cells
(CTC) were isolated by depleting the normal blood cell
component using a microﬂuidic platform (negCTC-iChip) as
previously described (15). Cells were collected, spun down
onto a microscope slide, and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Samples were then permeabilized with 1% NP40 in PBS,
blocked with 2% goat serum, and immunostained with chicken anti-GFP primary antibody (Abcam, ab13970) followed by
donkey anti-chicken Dylight 488 secondary antibody (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, 703-486-155). Slides were imaged under
10 magniﬁcation using the BioView Ltd automated imaging
system, and hand validated to enumerate CTCs.
Ex vivo imaging and culture of explanted scaffolds
Explanted scaffolds recovered from tumor-bearing mice
were cultured for up to 4 weeks in F-12K Medium (ATCC) or
DMEM (Gibco/Life Technologies) þ 10% FBS þ 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Gibco/Life Technologies) and imaged weekly
with an IVIS Lumina II platform (Caliper Life Sciences) after
incubation in a 1:200 dilution of RediJect D-Luciferin Ultra
Bioluminescent Substrate (Caliper Life Sciences) for 15 minutes at 37 C.
Recovery of live cells from scaffolds, FACS isolation, and
gene expression proﬁling
Seeded (metþ) and unseeded (met) scaffolds were minced
with a scalpel and the cellular component was digested with
collagenase IV in 1 HBSS (Gibco/Life Technologies) for 45
minutes at 37 C and ﬁltered through a 70 mm cell strainer. After
1-minute incubation in ACK lysing buffer (Gibco/Life Technologies), cells were washed and resuspended in PBS–2% FBS
solution. Cells were stained with anti-mouse CD45-Biotin
(eBioscience, 13-0451-81, clone 30-F11) and anti-mouse
CD31-Biotin (eBioscience, 13-0311-81, clone 390) followed by
streptavidin–APC incubation (eBioscience, 17-4317-82). To
avoid unwanted spillover from the very bright GFP signal into
channels excited by the same laser and to reach maximum
sorting stringency of pure stromal cells, we opted for a combination of CD45 and CD31 in the same channel (APC) using a
different excitation laser. Cell sorting was performed on a four
laser FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) based on endogenous GFP
and antibody-linked APC ﬂuorescence. 40 ,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining was used for dead cell exclusion. Collected
GFP/CD45/CD31 cells were lysed in TRIzol followed by
standard RNA isolation. Equivalent amounts of RNA (50 ng)
were reverse transcribed using RT2 First Strand Kit and cDNA
was preampliﬁed with RT2 PreAMP Primer Mix (SABiosciences/Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Each sample was loaded on a Mouse Tumor Metastasis RT2
Proﬁler PCR Array (SABiosciences/Qiagen) for real-time PCRbased quantitation of gene expression on an ABI/PRISM 7500
platform (Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies). Quality control, normalization against the arithmetic mean of four different housekeeping genes, data analysis, and generation of
scatter plots were done with the RT2 Proﬁler PCR Array Data
Analysis v3.5 software (SABiosciences/Qiagen). Brieﬂy, nor-

malized expression of each gene between the two groups (metþ
and met) was plotted against one another. The central line in
the plots in Fig. 4A indicates unchanged gene expression.
Boundaries (fold regulation cutoff) were set at 5-fold change.
Gene-wise ANOVA followed by t test between PC-3 metþ,
MDA-231 #1833 metþ, and met qPCR samples was performed
to identify differentially expressed genes. Correction for multiple hypotheses was carried out using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure and genes with FDR < 0.1 were considered
signiﬁcant. For standard ﬂow cytometry analysis (BD FACSCalibur), CD45/CD31 cells sorted from scaffolds 4 weeks
after subdermal implant were stained with APC-anti-human
HLA-ABC (BD Pharmingen, 555555) or biotin-anti-mouse
CD44 (BD Pharmingen, 553132, clone IM7) followed by streptavidin-APC (eBioscience, 17-4317-82).
Histologic analysis
For immunohistochemistry, PC-3 cells and tissue sections
(see below) were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X solution, and then blocked with
10% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin
solution diluted in PBS. Samples were serially incubated
with rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Pharmingen, 55027), mouse
anti-human cytokeratin 7 and 8 (BD Biosciences, 349205) or
mouse anti-human Vimentin antibody (DAKO, 7165), followed by biotinylated goat anti-rat or goat anti-mouse IgG
(BA-9400 and BA-9200, Vecta Lab) and ABC solution (Vecta
Lab). Signal was visualized by applying DAB substrate (Vecta
Lab).
Explanted scaffolds were embedded in optical cutting temperature compound and snap-frozen with dry ice-chilled 2methylbutane. Frozen scaffold blocks were cut to 10 to 30 mm
thickness and stored at 80 C until use. For hematoxylin/
eosin, Giemsa, Trichrome, and Periodic Acid–Schiff stainings,
frozen tissue sections were ﬁxed with 10% buffered formalin
solution and stained following the manufacturer's protocol
(American Master Tech). For immunoﬂuorescence stainings,
frozen tissue sections were ﬁxed with ice-cold acetone, blocked
with 10% normal goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin
diluted in PBS. Slides were incubated with rat anti-mouse
CD31 (BD Pharmingen, 55027), mouse anti-human vimentin
antibody (DAKO, 7165), or rabbit anti-human/mouse-IL1b
(Abcam, ab9722), followed by goat anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor
594 (A11007), goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (A11029), or
goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 680 (A21109; Invitrogen/Life
Technologies). Finally, VectaShield mounting medium with
DAPI was applied and slides were imaged under confocal
(Leica SP5) and ﬂuorescence (Zeiss 200) microscopes.
Scanning electron microscope imaging
For scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging, in vitro
cell-cultured and explanted scaffolds were ﬁxed with 2%
glutaradehyde, serially dehydrated with 20%, 50%, 70%, 90%,
95%, and 100% ethanol solution, and further dried using a
lyophilizer overnight. A thin platinum/gold ﬁlm was deposited
on the samples using a sputter coating machine (208HR,
Cressington) and then samples were imaged under FESEM
Ultra55 (Zeiss).

Analysis of IL1b expression in primary tumors
We looked at the effect of grade/Gleason score on IL1b
expression in previously published datasets for prostate (16)
and breast (17) cancer. To determine the relationship
between IL1b expression and grade/Gleason score, we collected log2 median centered intensity data and grade/Gleason categorical data from the Oncomine website (https://
www.oncomine.org). With respect to the prostate cancer
dataset, a t test was used to calculate the signiﬁcance of the
IL1b expression change between 12 Gleason score 6 samples
and 15 Gleason score 9 samples. Similarly, we used a t test to
calculate the signiﬁcance of the IL1b expression change
between 19 grade I tumor and 69 grade III breast tumor
samples. Statistics were calculated using R (http://www.
r-project.org).
Meta-analysis of IL1b expression between primary and
metastatic tumors
A meta-analysis comparing IL1b expression between metastatic and primary tumor samples was performed using
data from two prostate (18, 19) and one breast (20) published datasets. We selected metastatic samples with higher
IL1b expression compared with the average IL1b level of the
primary samples (or paired primary in the case of ref. 20)
within each experiment. Using this criterion, we retained 8
unpaired (18), 11 unpaired (19), and 4 paired (20) sets of
samples. The meta-analysis was performed using an inhouse R script.

Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise stated, P values were calculated on the
basis of a two-tailed Student t test. All sets of data met normal
distribution. As an exception, a nonparametric Wilcoxon
signed-rank test was applied to calculate the P value of the
difference between the two cohorts of mice in the IL1Ra drug
experiment, where values were not following a parametric
model. Values of P < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. All error
bars represent SD of three or more replicates, as indicated in
each ﬁgure. The sample size of each experiment is speciﬁed in
ﬁgures and legends.

Results
Bioengineered scaffolds recapitulate metastasisreceptive microenvironments
We adapted a bioengineered surrogate to mimic the 3D
microenvironment of bone marrow (11, 21–24) to study
blood-borne metastases in epithelial cancers. The marrowlike structure, which enhances engraftment by hematopoietic elements and leukemia cell lines, made it an attractive
model to study prostate and breast cancer metastases,
which have tropism for bone (25). Hydrogel scaffolds were
synthesized with the microarchitecture of bone marrow
sinusoids through a pattern of repeating honeycombs,
matching mechanical properties of soft trabecular spongy
bone (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). These scaffolds
were conjugated with type I collagen and they effectively

supported the adhesion and proliferation of introduced
primary human BMSCs. The BMSCs secreted growth factors, chemokines, and ECM that are concentrated within
the hydrogel (Fig. 1B). Compared with noncellularized
scaffolds, BMSC coating led to increased invasion by
human cancer cells, as measured in a modiﬁed Boyden
chamber assay (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1B). The
seeding and proliferation of luciferase- and GFP-tagged
(Luc-GFP) cells was also signiﬁcantly enhanced by
BMSC-coating of scaffolds in a cell density–dependent
manner (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1C).
When subcutaneously implanted on the back of immunocompromised (NSG) mice, BMSC-coated scaffolds progressively lost their human stromal cell constituent, as
shown by in vivo imaging analysis of tagged stromal cells,
as well as by loss of staining of the retrieved devices for cells
bearing human HLA markers (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C).
Within 4 weeks from implantation, human BMSC cells were
fully replaced by endogenous mouse stromal cells (Fig. 1E
and Supplementary Fig. S2C and D). At this time point, the
majority (89.2%) of CD45/CD31 mouse cells within the
scaffold were scored positive for CD44 (Supplementary
Fig. S2C), a marker enriched in mesenchymal cells, which
plays an active role as a homing receptor and interacts with
bone-speciﬁc ligands such as osteopontin (26–28). In addition, Masson trichrome staining revealed abundant presence
of connective tissue (Fig. 1E), which makes this platform
ideal to study microenvironmental changes at the stromal
cell level.

We previously reported that the transient colonization by
human BMSCs serves to initiate the recruitment of murine
hematopoietic precursors to the device (11), which is then
sustained by mouse cells. Although we have not tested the
sublineage differentiation ability of hematopoietic cells following recruitment to implanted scaffolds, we previously demonstrated active homing of endogenous mouse Lin/Sca1þ/ckitþ progenitors as well as engraftment capacity for human
CD34 cells (11).
Taken together, while the model that we established does
not precisely recapitulate the bone marrow environment, it
mimics some of its main physical and cellular characteristics
and provides an effective platform to enable capture and
analysis of newly established metastases in a model organism.
Implantable microenvironments can capture CTCs and
support their engraftment
We developed an orthotopic tumor model, in which LucGFP–tagged cancer cells can be used for in vivo tracking of both
the primary tumor and the metastatic deposits derived from
hematogenous seeding of the implanted scaffolds (Fig. 1F). For
these experiments, we implanted four BMSC-functionalized
scaffolds on the back of each recipient NSG mouse, allowing
them to become coated with mouse-derived stromal cells
and vasculature. Four weeks later, 1  106 Luc-GFP PC-3
human prostate cancer cells were injected directly into the
prostate, and mice were monitored using BLI as they demonstrated a progressive increase in primary tumor burden
(Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). PC-3 cells were chosen

for their proven ability to generate CTCs in the blood of mice
bearing orthotopic xenografts in the prostate (data not
shown). Animals were sacriﬁced at 2 months, at which time
primary prostate tumors weighted approximately 400 mg.
CTCs were readily detectable in blood samples (range: 13–
44 cells/mL/mouse) using a microﬂuidic capture platform
(CTC-iChip; Fig. 2B; ref. 15). At the same time, ex vivo analysis
of scaffolds using BLI revealed tumor cell–derived signal in
12 of 97 scaffolds (12%; average metþ scaffolds/mouse: 0.58;
range: 0–4; Fig. 2C). In the 13 mice analyzed, the number of
CTCs was correlated with the fraction of luciferase-positive
scaffolds (R2 ¼ 0.97224), consistent with the presumed hematogenous seeding of the scaffolds (Fig. 2D). This ﬁnding highlights the ability of the scaffold to efﬁciently recruit tumor
cells from circulation in vivo. PC-3 cells that had metastasized
to the scaffolds were clearly identiﬁed by immunohistochemical staining using their characteristic markers, human vimentin and cytokeratin (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S4).
Further culturing of individual explanted scaffolds in vitro
for up to a month, yielded additional luciferase signal, with
14 of 40 (35%) becoming positive as rare tumor cells that had
initially seeded the scaffolds in vivo were allowed to further
proliferate in culture (Fig. 2F).
As control, we tested the efﬁciency of tumor cell seeding
in vivo by other cancer cell types (Supplementary Fig. S3B
and S3C). Poorly metastatic DU-145 prostate cancer cells
(29) failed to engraft in the scaffold (0/10 scaffolds), despite
generating sizable primary tumors in the prostate. In contrast, the highly aggressive MDA-231 #1833 breast cancer cell
subline, which has been selected for enhanced tropism to
bone (4), generated luciferase-positive signal from 13 of 24
scaffolds (54%), which all turned positive after one month
in culture ex vivo (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Serial transplantation of CTC-harboring
microenvironments allows cellular and molecular
characterization of metastasis in vivo
The rapid expansion of primary prostate tumors in mice
following orthotopic inoculation necessitated removal of the
scaffolds before they are fully mature, as noted by the fact
that some explanted devices turn luciferase-positive following ex vivo culture. To enable more complete monitoring
of metastatic microenvironments as they evolve in vivo, we
established a transplantation assay, whereby scaffolds are
transplanted from tumor-bearing mice into na€ve recipient
mice (Fig. 3A). The speciﬁc biophysical characteristics of the
scaffold allow successful transplants by minimizing time and
manipulation of the premetastatic microenvironment
formed in vivo, and recipient mice can then be imaged for
an additional 2 months, without interference from a large
primary tumor (Fig. 3B and C). Indeed, 26 of 68 scaffolds
(38%) were scored as metþ using this in vivo imaging end
point, matching the frequency obtained after ex vivo culture
(Fig. 2F). Tumor cell colonization of the devices was consistent with observation of visceral metastases in primary
tumor-bearing mice. Of note, with this serial transplantation
assay, none of the transplanted scaffolds from mice harboring DU-145 primary tumors (negative control) and all of

scaffolds allowed us to capture within each device the full
evolution of metastasis, from initial extravasation and seeding of a single CTC to colonization and ECM degradation
(Fig. 3D). Thus, integration of transplantable scaffolds with
live imaging in orthotopic mouse tumor models may enable
detailed characterization of the formation and progression
of the metastatic niche in vivo.
Coexistence of tumor-inﬁltrated (metþ) and tumor-free
(met) scaffolds within the same animal prompted us to
explore differences in their microenvironment at the molecular level. Live cells were recovered from paired metþ and
met scaffolds, derived from three independent tumor-bearing mice. Distinct cell populations from matched metþ and
met scaffolds were stained for various cell surface markers
and quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 3E and F and Supplementary Fig. S6D and S6E). Consistent with a prior study
showing direct competition between prostate cancer cells
and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow niche (30),
we found that the hematopoietic/endothelial compartment
(GFP/mCD45þ/mCD31þ) was reduced in the presence of
metastatic prostate cancer cells (GFPþ; Fig. 3F). This effect
was even more marked for the highly invasive MDA-231
#1833 breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S6E). In contrast, the relative number of stromal cells was not affected by
tumor burden.
To further characterize the stromal compartment of tumorinﬁltrated scaffolds, we compared RNA expression proﬁles
from FACS-sorted stromal cells derived from either met or
metþ scaffolds from the same tumor-bearing mouse, interrogating a predesigned qPCR array including 85 metastasisrelated genes (Supplementary Table S1). Among the most
commonly upregulated genes from metþ stromal cells (>5 fold
change), we identiﬁed the cytokine IL1b (Fig. 4A), matrix
metalloproteinases (Mmp-13, Mmp-10, and Mmp-9) that are
known contributors to the premetastatic niche, as well as the
angiogenesis-related tyrosine kinase Flt-4, the prometastatic
gene Etv-4 and the Mcam adhesion molecule. Among these,
IL1b was the most differentially induced gene in the PC-3
prostate cancer model (3,600-fold; P < 0.005; FDR < 0.02) and
it was also upregulated (21 fold; P < 0.02; FDR < 0.05) in the
MDA-231 breast cancer model (Fig. 4A). Immunohistochemical staining of metþ scaffolds conﬁrmed that IL1b expression
was almost exclusively derived from stromal cells, rather than
cancer cells (Fig. 4B).
Implantable microenvironments provide an in vivo
platform to identify relevant stromal-derived factors in
cancer metastasis models
The expression of IL1b by human cancers is well documented, although the source of its production may be variable. The
cytokine may be derived from malignant cells themselves, from
stromal cells in response to factors secreted by cancer cells
(31), or as part of the inﬂammatory response that accompanies
tumor growth (32). IL1b overexpression itself is associated
with increased MMP expression, invasiveness, angiogenesis,

and tumor-mediated immune suppression (33–35). To conﬁrm
the physiologic signiﬁcance of IL1b expression as it relates to
metastatic propensity, we tested a well annotated prostate
cancer dataset (16). Expression of IL1b by primary prostate
tumors was positively correlated with their Gleason score, a
well-deﬁned histologic marker of invasiveness and metastatic
recurrence risk (Fig. 4C). A similar correlation between histologic grade and IL1b expression was evident in our analysis of a
large breast cancer dataset (Fig. 4C; ref. 17). Furthermore, a
meta-analysis of multiple available datasets (18–20) showed
signiﬁcant upregulation of IL1b in both prostate and breast
cancer metastases, compared with primary tumors (Fig. 4D).

All available datasets are based on gene expression proﬁling of
bulk primary or metastatic tumors, thus containing a mixed
population of cancer cells and stromal cells. The elevation in
IL1b expression may therefore be even greater in a pure
stromal cell population. These clinical correlations are consistent with previous reports of IL1 expression in several
invasive tumor types (33, 36, 37).
To test the reliability of our new scaffold-based method to
identify relevant metastatic stromal components and verify the
functional signiﬁcance of stromal cell IL1b expression, we
treated prostate tumor-bearing mice carrying subcutaneous
scaffolds with either an FDA-approved IL1 receptor antagonist

group). Mice were treated daily for 2 weeks, beginning 6 weeks
after orthotopic inoculation of prostate cancer cells. At the
time of IL1Ra treatment, primary tumors were readily detectable by BLI in vivo imaging, but the scaffolds were not yet
scored positive. After 2 weeks of treatment, scaffolds were
transplanted into na€ve recipient mice, which were monitored
for the development of metastases without further treatment
for an additional 2 months (Fig. 4E). IL1Ra-treated mice

showed a 50% reduction in the number of metþ scaffolds: 3
of 16 (18.7%) metþ scaffolds in treated mice versus 6 of 16
(37.5%) scaffolds in controls (P < 0.005). The positive scaffolds
derived from IL1Ra-treated mice also had a dramatic reduction in luciferase signal intensity (Fig. 4F). As tumor-bearing
mice were treated only for a limited time before transplantation of scaffolds into na€ve mice, it is likely that IL1b contributes to the early recruitment of CTCs to the scaffold rather
than supporting tumor cell proliferation after engraftment.

Bioengineered Model of Metastatic Cancer

Consistent with this model, IL1Ra had no effect on PC-3 cell
proliferation in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S7A). PC-3 metþ
scaffolds derived from untreated mice also showed no growth
advantage or growth suppression, following ex vivo culture in
the presence of either recombinant IL1b or IL1Ra (Supplementary Fig. S7B).

Discussion
The importance of the microenvironment in metastatic
progression is well established, but our understanding of
the precise contribution of speciﬁc factors and cell populations, which have been extensively studied at the primary
tumor level (38, 39), is limited at secondary sites. Given the
technical hurdles incidental to recovering and studying the
stromal compartment of the metastatic niche in vivo, we
aimed to develop an experimental method to test whether a
bioengineered scaffold could be used to dissect the cellular
components of a metastatic lesion. As increasing numbers
of therapeutic agents are developed to target the tumorsupporting stroma within bone metastases (40), there is a
need for controllable models that mimic physiologic
tumor/stromal interactions in vivo, extending beyond standard available in vitro coculture experimental conditions (7,
8). Metastases to distant organs are infrequent in mouse
tumor models (41), and these are rarely accessible for
detailed molecular analysis. The biocompatible scaffold
described here circumvents these technical limitations
based on its high efﬁciency engraftment by blood-borne
CTCs, as well as its susceptibility to serial in vivo passaging
and monitoring and ex vivo cellular and molecular analysis.
This versatile platform to capture viable metastasis-competent CTCs and analyze their interactions with host
stromal cells builds on previous approaches (42, 43),
enabling study of the evolution of the metastatic niche at
different stages of tumor progression. For instance, we
show that explanting tumor-seeded scaffolds at different
time points allows characterization of changes within the
stromal compartment that may allow the establishment of
a metastatic focus.
In providing a proof-of-concept of the ability of our
platform to uncover relevant stromal signals involved in
CTC recruitment and initiation of metastatic lesions, we
conﬁrmed the pivotal role for the IL1b cytokine in promoting tumor cell engraftment. In our experiments, IL1b expression was detected within stromal cells of tumor-bearing but
not tumor-free scaffolds, and its role in enhancing metastatic seeding of the bioengineered scaffold by prostate PC-3
cancer cells was supported by the effectiveness of a receptor
antagonist administered systemically. Our observations are
consistent with a recent report of increased bone metastases
following intracardiac injection of IL1b-transduced prostate
cancer cells in the mouse (37). In these experiments, knockdown of endogenous IL1b within injected tumor cells had no
effect in reducing the frequency of metastatic lesions, supporting our observation that stromal cell expression may be
the more physiologic source of this cytokine, rather than
tumor cells. Of note, additional stromal-derived factors were

www.aacrjournals.org

evident in our analysis of scaffolds bearing either prostate or
breast cancer colonization, some of which overlap, suggesting that our platform may have broad utility in characterizing tumor/stromal interactions across multiple tumor
types. Among the differentially expressed genes identiﬁed
in metastatic stroma, some, such as MMPs, chemokines
(Ccl7) and chemokine receptors (Cxcr2, Cxcr4) are likely
involved in the formation of a receptive microenvironment,
whereas others, such as tyrosine kinase receptors (Flt-4)
and transcription factors (Etv-4), possibly favor the active
growth of a secondary tumor mass. Both the engraftment
and the growth-promoting aspects, although difﬁcult to
distinguish, contribute to the homing and generation of
bone metastasis and can be interrogated using the transplantable scaffold described in this study. As exempliﬁed by
the consequences of suppressing IL1b in the PC-3 cell model,
identiﬁcation of key factors implicated in tumor/stromal
crosstalk may lead to potential therapeutic intervention.
Taken together, this integrated approach, involving implantation of bioengineered devices into mouse tumor models
followed by cellular and molecular characterization of colonizing cell populations, offers a powerful tool to study
the metastatic microenvironment, dissect molecular changes
within different components of the metastatic niche, and
model tumor/stromal interactions in vivo.
