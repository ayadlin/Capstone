Abstract
The conjugation of proteins with ubiquitin plays numerous
regulatory roles through both proteasomal-dependent and
nonproteasomal-dependent functions. Alterations in ubiquitylation are observed in a wide range of pathologic conditions,
including numerous malignancies. For this reason, there is
great interest in targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system in
cancer. Several classes of proteasome inhibitors, which block
degradation of ubiquitylated proteins, are widely used in
research, and one, Bortezomib, is now in clinical use. Despite
the well-defined and central role of the ubiquitin-activating
enzyme (E1), no cell permeable inhibitors of E1 have been
identified. Such inhibitors should, in principle, block all
functions of ubiquitylation. We now report 4[4-(5-nitro-furan2-ylmethylene)-3,5-dioxo-pyrazolidin-1-yl]-benzoic acid ethyl
ester (PYR-41) as the first such inhibitor. Unexpectedly, in
addition to blocking ubiquitylation, PYR-41 increased total
sumoylation in cells. The molecular basis for this is unknown;
however, increased sumoylation was also observed in cells
harboring temperature-sensitive E1. Functionally, PYR-41
attenuates cytokine-mediated nuclear factor-KB activation.
This correlates with inhibition of nonproteasomal (Lys-63)
ubiquitylation of TRAF6, which is essential to IKB kinase
activation. PYR-41 also prevents the downstream ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of IKBA. Furthermore,
PYR-41 inhibits degradation of p53 and activates the
transcriptional activity of this tumor suppressor. Consistent
with this, it differentially kills transformed p53-expressing
cells. Thus, PYR-41 and related pyrazones provide proof of
principle for the capacity to differentially kill transformed
cells, suggesting the potential for E1 inhibitors as therapeutics
in cancer. These inhibitors can also be valuable tools for
studying ubiquitylation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9472–81]

Introduction
Ubiquitylation is catalyzed by the sequential action of ubiquitinactivating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and a
ubiquitin protein ligase (E3). In humans, there is a single essential

E1 and over 30 distinct E2s. E3s, of which there are estimated to be
between 500 and 1000, are largely responsible for conferring
specificity to ubiquitylation (1, 2). Ubiquitylation is essential to
numerous cellular and developmental processes, including, but not
limited to, protein quality control, growth, apoptosis, antigen
presentation, DNA repair, and signal transduction. Proteins can be
modified either with chains of ubiquitin molecules (polyubiquitylation or multiubiquitylation) or by one or more single ubiquitin
moieties (monoubiquitylation). The most well-characterized role
for ubiquitin is in targeting proteins for degradation by the 26S
proteasome after modification with chains of four or more
ubiquitins linked through Lys-48 (K48) of ubiquitin. K63-linked
polyubiquitin chains play essential roles in the activation of nuclear
factor-nB (NF-nB) induced by cytokines and engagement of Tolllike receptors (3). K63 ubiquitylation and monoubiquitylation are
also both implicated in vesicular trafficking of proteins, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and DNA repair (4, 5). There is also evidence
that other ubiquitin linkages play critical roles, including the
activation of ubiquitin ligases themselves (6).
Alterations in ubiquitylation are observed in most, if not all,
cancer cells. This is manifested by destabilization of tumor
suppressors, such as p53, and overexpression of protooncogenes,
including c-Myc and c-Jun (1). The growing appreciation of the
importance of ubiquitylation has resulted in great interest in
targeting components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in
cancer. E3s represent particularly attractive targets because of
their role in substrate recognition. However, because of structural
similarities that characterize members of each class of E3s, valid
concerns have been raised about the feasibility of blocking the
function of specific E3s (7). There is, however, some evidence
supporting such a strategy, at least for Hdm2/Mdm2, which targets
p53 for degradation (8–11).
Although inhibition of the proteasome is considered a relatively
nonspecific way to target ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation,
the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib is now being used to treat
multiple myeloma and is under evaluation for mantle cell
lymphoma and other non–Hodgkin’s lymphomas (12, 13). Thus,
inhibition of the ubiquitin system at points where there is, at face
value, little substrate specificity has the potential to result in a
substantial therapeutic index in cancer.
Whereas the proteasome represents the final destination for
many ubiquitylated proteins, E1 is the common first step in
ubiquitylation, whether or not the modified protein is ultimately
degraded by the proteasome. We now report the first cell
permeable inhibitor of the ubiquitin E1, 4[4-(5-nitro-furan-2ylmethylene)-3,5-dioxo-pyrazolidin-1-yl]-benzoic acid ethyl ester.
We named this pyrazone derivative PYR-41. Among the cellular
consequences of exposure of cells to PYR-41 is inhibition of NF-nB

activation and increased levels and activity of p53. These findings
correlate with the ability of PYR-41 to induce apoptosis in
transformed cells, particularly those expressing wild-type p53.

Materials and Methods
Compounds. The pyrazones reported in this study were identified
from a commercial screening library purchased from ChemBridge, Inc. Hits
were validated based on compounds resupplied from Asinex USA, Ltd.,
and were further qualified for purity and identity by standard chemical
methods.
Plasmids. Plasmids encoding the NF-nB reporter pNF3TKLuc (14),
pGEX-2TK-Ub (15), cyclin E (16), GFPu (17), pGEX-Nedd4 (11), p53 (18),
and E6 (18) have been described. The plasmid encoding glutathione
S-transferase (GST)–UbcH5B was generated by subcloning of UbcH5B from
pGEM7 into pGEX-KG from Nco I to Sac I.
Reagents and antibodies. Recombinant mouse His6-E1 was produced
in insect cells using constructs provided by Dr. Kazuhiro Iwai (Osaka City
University, Osaka, Japan). Purified rabbit E1 was purchased from Boston
Biochem. Antibodies against E1 (19) and SUMO-1 (20) were gifts from
Drs. Allen Taylor and Mary Dasso, respectively. Recombinant UbcH5B was
produced as described (21). GST-ubiquitin in pGEX-2TK and GST-UbcH5B
were expressed as described (15, 22). 32P labeling, GST cleavage, and
purification of ubiquitin has been described (22). Recombinant epidermal
growth factor (EGF) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) were from
R&D Systems. Dexamethasone was from Sigma. Human IL-1a was from
PeproTech. TALON cobalt affinity resin was from Clontech. Protein G
Sepharose and glutathione Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences.
Antibodies recognizing EGF receptor (EGFR), phosphorylated EGFR, and
Cul1 were from Cell Signaling. Antibodies recognizing Hdm2 (Ab-1 and
Ab-2) were from Oncogene. Antibodies recognizing InBa, phosphorylated
InBa, cyclin D3, p53, GST, TRAF6, and GFP were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Anti–caspase-9 was from Stressgen.
Cell lines. Jurkat T cells, 2B4 T hybridoma cells, L929, ts20, and tsA1S9
cells (23–25) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and
50 Amol/L of 2-mercaptoethanol. HEK293 Tet-On cells expressing myc-SUMO
(26), HeLa, A9, C8 (27), U2OS, and U2OS-pG13 (11) were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FCS. Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and RPE-E1A
cells were maintained as described (11). All media was supplemented with
100 units/mL of penicillin and 100 Ag/mL of streptomycin.
In vitro ubiquitylation reactions. Rabbit or mouse E1 (f250 ng) was
incubated with 32P-ubiquitin (28) in 1 reaction buffer [50 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.4), 0.2 mmol/L ATP, 0.5 mmol/L MgCl2] at room temperature for
15 min. In some experiments, the His-tagged mouse E1 was bound to
TALON cobalt affinity resin before carrying out incubations and reactions.
For E2 assays, GST-UbcH5B (f900 ng) was bound to glutathione Sepharose
beads. Mouse E1 and 32P-ubiquitin were added to the beads in 1 reaction
buffer and incubated as for E1 reactions. Samples were heated in
nonreducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE.
Thioesters with ubiquitin were visualized by Storm PhosphoImager
(Amersham). In vitro autoubiquitylation reactions were carried out on E3
prebound to anti-GST on protein G beads essentially as described (22).
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Except where noted, cells
were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1%
SDS, 1 Ag/mL aprotinin, 100 Ag/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and
5 Ag/mL leupeptin] and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation
at 15,000g for 20 min. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant was
diluted 4-fold with PBS and incubated with protein G–bound specific
antibody for 3 to 5 h at 4jC. Samples were heated in SDS-PAGE sample
buffer containing reducing agent (DTT), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated
with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20] before addition of specific antibody.
After thorough washing, bound antibodies were detected with horseradish
peroxidase–labeled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). For analysis of cellular E1 thioesters with ubiquitin, RPE

cells were treated as indicated and processed using a urea-containing buffer
for cell lysis as described (19), before resolution by SDS-PAGE.
In vitro degradation assay. Cyclin E degradation assays were carried
out using S100 cytosol prepared from CA46 cells (16). Human cyclin E was
synthesized by coupled transcription/translation according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega) using 35S-labeled Met and Cys. For each
reaction, 50 Ag of S100 were first incubated with DMSO or indicated
compounds in a 50-AL reaction mixture for 30 min at room temperature.
Labeled cyclin E was then added, and the cytosolic preparation was further
incubated up to 90 min. For some reactions, 250 ng of recombinant E1 were
added to the reaction mixture before the addition of cyclin E. Aliquots of
10 AL were taken at the indicated times. After boiling in sample buffer, they
were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. p53 degradation
was carried out using wild-type p53 and human papillomavirus-16 E6 that
was translated in vitro as described for cyclin E. Degradation of p53 was
allowed to proceed by mixing rabbit reticulocyte lysates containing p53
with either control lysate or lysate containing E6 in a 50-AL reaction,
containing 25 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L NaCl, and 3 mmol/L DTT,
for up to 3 h at room temperature. Where appropriate, p53 was preincubated with PYR-41 or DMSO for 15 min before adding E6. Aliquots were
removed at the indicated times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by
autoradiography.
Luciferase assay. Assays were carried out using the Luciferase Assay
System (Promega) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Results
PYR-41 inhibits the ubiquitin E1 but not E2. We previously
described a series of 5-deazaflavins (HLI98s), identified through an
in vitro high-throughput screen, as inhibitors of the ubiquitin ligase
activity of Hdm2 that stabilize and activate p53 (11). In an attempt
to identify more potent inhibitors, a larger library was screened.
Many of the ‘‘hits’’ prevented ubiquitylation mediated by multiple
E3s of different structural classes (data not shown). Because of the
nature of the screen, inhibitors of either E1 or E2, which both
contain active site cysteines that form thioester intermediates with
ubiquitin (UbfE1/UbfE2) and whose inactivation would readout
as inhibition of multiple E3s, would also score as hits. Therefore,
these small molecules were tested for inhibition of ubiquitin
thioester bond formation with E1, as well as with the E2 used in the
high-throughput screen (Ube2d2/UbcH5B). Some compounds
inhibited both E1 and E2 (data not shown), suggesting that they
might react indiscriminately with free thiols. However, one
compound, PYR-41, showed selective inhibition of E1. It blocked
loading of immobilized His6-tagged E1 with ubiquitin with an IC50
of <10 Amol/L (>60% inhibition at 10 Amol/L; Fig. 1A). At 50 Amol/L,
there was at least 95% inhibition. In general >90% inhibition at
50 Amol/L was observed within 3 to 5 min of treatment (data not
shown). Inhibition of E1 activity persisted even when immobilized
E1 was washed thoroughly before the thioester assay (Fig. 1A). This
raises the possibility that this compound might covalently modify
E1. PYR-41 did not affect the transfer of ubiquitin to E2 from E1
that was preloaded with ubiquitin (not shown). Similarly, no
inhibition was observed when immobilized UbcH5B was treated
with PYR-41 and then extensively washed before addition of E1
(Fig. 1B compare lanes 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained with
His6-tagged UbcH5B and with another E2, Ube2G2 (data not
shown). These results show that PYR-41 directly inhibits E1, but
not E2.
The structure of PYR-41 suggests that it could be a target for
nucleophilic attack (Fig. 1C) and potentially could react with the
active site cysteine of E1. This could occur either by Michael
addition to the exocyclic double bond (Fig. 1C-b) or via reaction
with the N-aryl bond (Fig. 1C-a). To evaluate whether other related

Figure 1. PYR-41 inhibits the ubiquitin E1. A, His6-tagged mouse E1 was immobilized on TALON beads and treated with PYR-41 for 15 min, as indicated. Beads were
either washed thoroughly in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Triton X-100 to remove free PYR-41 or not washed, as indicated. Formation of UbfE1
thioester bonds was assessed using 32P-labeled ubiquitin and resolution of samples by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Bottom, percentage inhibition for
treated samples. B, GST-UbcH5B (E2) bound to glutathione Sepharose beads was incubated with purified soluble E1 in reaction buffer. Formation of thioester
linkages of 32P-ubiquitin with E2 and E1 was assessed. Lane 2, immobilized GST-UbcH5B was pretreated with PYR-41 (50 Amol/L) for 15 min before washing the beads
and adding E1; lane 3, E1 was pretreated with PYR-41 for 15 min before addition to E2; lane 4, both E1 and immobilized E2 were exposed to PYR-41 before
assessment of thioester bond formation. C, chemical structures of PYR-41 and related pyrazones; N -aryl bond (a), exocyclic double bond (b), and nitro group (c ).
Bottom, rabbit E1 (500 ng) was incubated with indicated compounds (50 Amol/L) for 15 min at 37jC. 32P-labeled ubiquitin and reaction buffer were then added to carry
out thioester assays. Samples were resolved by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. D, 2 pmol of E1 immobilized as in A were pretreated with PYR-41or DMSO, together
with GSH, as indicated in 30 AL for 15 min. Beads were washed, and formation of UbfE1 thioester bonds was then assessed as in A.

pyrazones would have similar activity, three related pyrazones were
evaluated. One of these, PYR-823, similarly inhibited loading of E1
with ubiquitin but did not directly affect E2 activity (Fig. 1C and
data not shown), whereas the other two had no effect at 50 Amol/L.
Based on this limited analysis, it seems that the nitro substitute on
the furan ring may be important for activity (Fig. 1C-c), whereas the
carboxyethyl ester substitute of the benzene ring of PYR-41 is less
important. These substitutions may play a role in allowing access to
the site of interaction on E1 or may control reactivity of these
pyrazones. To assess potential reactivity of PYR-41 with sulfhydryls,
immobilized E1 was incubated with PYR-41 in the presence of an
excess of reduced glutathione (GSH) as a source of reactive thiols.
After extensive washing, the capacity to form UbfE1 thioesters was
assessed. GSH totally abolished inhibition of E1 activity by PYR-41
when it was added at 104-fold to 105-fold excess relative to E1
(Fig. 1D, lanes 6 and 7). This supports the notion that PYR-41 may
function by covalently modifying E1, perhaps on its active site
cysteine.
The specificity of PYR-41 was further evaluated by assessing
effects on caspase activity in cytosol from 2B4 T-cell hybridoma

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

cells induced to undergo apoptosis. No inhibition of caspase
activity by PYR-41 was observed in cell lysates from apoptotic cells.
In fact, treatment of 2B4 cells with PYR-41 activates caspases and
induces apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S1 and data not shown).
The effects of PYR-41 on purified Nedd4 were also evaluated.
Partial inhibition of autoubiquitylation of this HECT domain E3
was observed at a concentration of PYR-41 that almost completely
inhibited UbfE1 thioesters (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similar
results were obtained with another HECT E3, E6-AP. Thus, in the
setting of the purified protein, PYR-41 seems to have some activity
toward HECT E3s, but substantially less than that toward E1.
PYR-41 acts on E1 to block protein degradation. To further
characterize the inhibition of E1 by PYR-41, the degradation of
cyclin E was assessed using cytosol (S100) that contains all the
components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system necessary to
degrade this protein (16, 18). PYR-41 efficiently blocked cyclin E
degradation (Fig. 2A, top), which was reversed by addition of
exogenous E1 at a final concentration of 50 nmol/L after a period
of 30 min (bottom). In contrast, inhibition of cyclin E degradation
by proteasome inhibitor (MG132) was not overcome by addition of

E1. PYR-41 also blocked the in vitro ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p53 in rabbit reticulocyte lysates when stimulated by human
papilloma virus E6 (Fig. 2B; ref. 28). Thus, PYR-41 inhibits E1 to
prevent ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation.
PYR-41 decreases the level of E1fUb thioesters in cells and
prevents proteasome inhibitor–induced accumulation of
ubiquitylated proteins. To determine if PYR-41 is active in cells,
its effect on the steady-state level of cellular UbfE1 thioesters was
evaluated (19). PYR-41 markedly reduced UbfE1 thioesters,
whereas the Hdm2 inhibitor HLI98C was without effect (Fig. 3A).
Results similar to those with PYR-41 were obtained with PYR-823
(not shown). For PYR-41, the IC50 for inhibition of thioester
formation in cells was between 10 and 25 Amol/L (data not shown).
To assess the effects of PYR-41 on the accumulation of ubiquitin
conjugates, cells were treated with PYR-41 in the presence or
absence of a proteasome inhibitor (ALLN), which is known to
increase total cellular ubiquitylation (29). Consistent with its
proposed function, PYR-41 blocked accumulation of ubiquitin
conjugates in response to the proteasome inhibitor ALLN over a
period of 90 min (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Notably and
unexpectedly, we generally did not observe a decrease in total
ubiquitin conjugates with PYR-41 in the absence of proteasome
inhibitor treatment (Fig. 3B and C, right). In some cases, we
observe an increase in high molecular weight ubiquitylated species
with a corresponding decrease in those at the lower molecular
weight region with no net change in total ubiquitin immunoreactivity (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 2).
Inhibition of E1 increases sumoylation in cells. NEDD8 and
SUMO-1 are conjugated to proteins on primary amines in a manner
that involves an enzyme cascade similar to that for ubiquitin (30).

As a control for ubiquitylation, we evaluated neddylation and
sumoylation in cells treated with PYR-41. No change in total
neddylation was observed (not shown). Similarly, no change in
neddylation of the well-characterized substrate Cul-1, which
undergoes continuous cycles of neddylation and deneddylation in
the context of SCF ubiquitin ligases (31), was seen for up to 8 h
(Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast, an unexpected rapid increase
in total sumoylated proteins was observed (Fig. 3C, left; Supplementary Fig. S4). To determine if loss of ubiquitin E1 activity can
account for this increased sumoylation, we examined two cell
lines expressing temperature-sensitive E1 (tsE1; ref. 24). For both
of these, incubation at the restrictive temperature significantly
increased sumoylation, which was particularly noticeable after
24 h (Fig. 3D). No increase in sumoylation of L929, the parental cell
of tsA1S9, was observed (Supplementary Fig. S5). Thus, although
other unknown effects could contribute to increased sumoylation
with PYR-41, based on two different tsE1 cell lines, inhibition of
the ubiquitin E1 is sufficient to result in an increase in total
sumoylation. For a few proteins, it has been shown that SUMO-1
and ubiquitin can compete for the same lysines (32). The striking
increase in sumoylation suggests that either this competition is
more general than appreciated or that there are other crossregulatory mechanisms involving these two protein modifications
yet to be uncovered. Dissecting out this relationship and how this
relates to the reported increase in sumoylation in HepG2 cells upon
treatment with proteasome inhibitor (33) will require further study.
PYR-41 inhibits both proteasome-dependent and proteasomeindependent activities of ubiquitylation. An inhibitor of the
ubiquitin E1 should block both proteasomal and nonproteasomal
functions of ubiquitylation. Accordingly, PYR-41 blocked both the

Figure 2. PYR-41 inhibits ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
degradation in vitro. A, 35S-labeled in vitro translated
cyclin E (which migrates as two bands due to alternative
initiation) was added to the S100 fraction, and its
degradation in the presence or absence of PYR-41
(50 Amol/L) or MG132 (50 Amol/L) was assessed.
Bottom, 30 min after the cytosol was treated with PYR-41,
250 ng of recombinant mouse E1 (final concentration,
50 nmol/L) was added to the mixture, together with in vitro
translated cyclin E. B, 35S-labeled p53 and E6 were
incubated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence or
absence of PYR-41, as indicated, and E6-dependent
degradation of p53 was assessed. Loss of p53 is quantified
in the accompanying graph.

Figure 3. PYR-41 is active in cells and enhances accumulation of sumoylated proteins. A, RPE cells were treated with the indicated compounds [50 Amol/L
PYR-41, 20 Amol/L HLI98C, or 10 mmol/L of the nonspecific alkylating agent iodoacetamide (IAA )] for 30 min. Cell lysates were heated in either nonreducing (NR ) or
reducing (R ) SDS-PAGE sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-E1. B, RPE cells were exposed to PYR-41 (50 Amol/L) or DMSO for
30 min at 37jC before treatment with or without the proteasome inhibitor ALLN (50 Amol/L) for an additional 90 min at 37jC. Total ubiquitylation was assessed by
immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin. C, HEK293 stably expressing tetracycline-inducible Myc-SUMO-1 were incubated with doxycycline (2 Ag/mL) for 20 h before
incubation with PYR-41 for 4 h at the indicated concentrations, followed by immunoblotting. A h-actin blot is shown as a loading control. D, cells expressing tsE1

ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of a test substrate, GFPu,
which has been used to assess the function of the ubiquitinproteasome system (Fig. 4A; ref. 34) and also results in an increased
level of cyclin D3 (Fig. 4B). Among the nonproteasomal roles of
ubiquitylation is down-regulation of signaling by EGFR, which
undergoes ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. This stimulated
phosphorylation leads to EGFR ubiquitylation and eventual trafficking to and destruction of activated receptors in lysosomes. This
process is dependent on monoubiquitylation and K63-mediated
ubiquitylation of EGFR, as well as monoubiquitylation of multiple
other proteins involved in membrane trafficking (35). Consistent with
its predicted activity, ligand-induced EGFR ubiquitylation was
decreased by PYR-41, whereas EGFR phosphorylation was increased
in intensity (Fig. 4C). As shown in Fig. 4D, this enhanced

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

phosphorylation persists for at least 30 min, and in this experiment,
where EGFR down-regulation was easily observed, loss of EGFR was
significantly delayed by PYR-41. Thus, PYR-41 inhibits ligand-induced
ubiquitylation of EGFR, prolongs the time during which receptors are
activated, and can attenuate ligand-mediated receptor downregulation.
The E1 inhibitor blocks cytokine-induced activation of
NF-KB. Activation of the NF-nB family of transcription factors
is critical to inflammatory responses and is implicated in
tumorigenesis (36). The efficacy of proteasome inhibitors in
cancer has been attributed, at least in part, to blockade of NF-nB
activation by preventing ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of the NF-nB inhibitor InBa (37). IL-1a activates NF-nB
through a pathway involving modification of TRAF6 with

K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which do not target TRAF6 for
proteasomal degradation (3). This ubiquitylation leads to
activation of InB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates InBa,
which is then ubiquitylated and degraded by the proteasome. As
shown (Fig. 5A), PYR-41 markedly inhibited transactivation of an
NF-nB–driven luciferase reporter when assessed after 2 h of
treatment with IL-1a, with >60% inhibition at 1 ng/mL of IL-1a.

activation was examined after stimulation at 10 ng/mL of IL-1a,
PYR-41 was found to largely prevent TRAF6 ubiquitylation
(Fig. 5B). Consistent with inhibition of IKK activation, PYR-41
also delayed the phosphorylation of InBa (Fig. 5C, middle). Thus,
PYR-41 inhibits both biochemical activation of NF-nB and has
substantial affects on signaling mediated through this transcription factor. Additionally, no net decrease in InBa was observed in
cells treated with PYR-41 over a period of 5 min (Fig. 5C, top).
When NF-nB was stimulated through TNF-a, degradation of InBa
was similarly prevented (Fig. 5D). These results indicate that,
unlike proteasome inhibitors, PYR-41 can reduce NF-nB activation by inhibiting ubiquitylation of upstream signaling molecules
and by blocking the more downstream proteasomal degradation
of InBa.

PYR-41 accumulates and activates p53 in cells. p53 is a tumor
suppressor whose level and activity are tightly controlled by Hdm2dependent, ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. We
predicted that PYR-41 should inhibit Hdm2, albeit indirectly, and
thereby stabilizes p53 and might possibly increase its activity. To
evaluate the effect of E1 inhibition on p53 activity, a cell line that
expresses wild-type p53 and also stably expresses a luciferase
reporter under the control of a p53 response element was used
(U2OS-pG13; ref. 11). PYR-41 at 20 Amol/L induced p53 reporter
activity to a level comparable with an optimal dose of Adriamycin,
a chemotherapeutic agent known to activate p53 (Fig. 6A). PYR-41
increased the level of p53 and also led to increased Hdm2, which is
known to undergo autoubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation; moreover, it led to a substantial increase in the cellular level of
the p53 responsive cell cycle inhibitor p21 (WAF-1), which is
induced by activation of p53 (Fig. 6B; ref. 38).
PYR-41 preferentially kills transformed cells with wild-type
p53. Transformed cells are particularly prone to undergo apoptosis
in response to activation of p53 (39, 40). To evaluate whether PYR41 induces differential killing of transformed cells expressing wildtype p53, RPE cells and E1A-transformed RPE cells (11) were
compared. E1A-transformed cells were killed within 20 h of

treatment with PYR-41 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas
untransformed RPE cells were relatively resistant (Fig. 6C). The
capacity of PYR-41 to cause cell death was not reversed by washing
of cells to remove this reagent after a 2-h incubation (Supplementary Fig. S6). The apoptotic nature of this cell death in transformed
RPE cells was confirmed by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage
and DNA fragmentation (not shown). Consistent with the essential
role of E1 in cell proliferation, some inhibition of cell growth of
nontransformed RPE cells is observed at higher concentrations
(20 Amol/L), whether or not cells were washed extensively after a
2-h incubation (Supplementary Fig. S7). To determine whether
death of transformed cells induced by PYR-41 correlates with p53
activity, we examined E1A and Ha-ras transformed mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from wild-type (C8) and p53-deficient
mice (A9; ref. 27). C8 cells exhibited a substantially greater
dose-dependent increase in cell death up to 24 h compared with A9
cells (Fig. 6D). However, as the time of incubation increased beyond
this, the differences between the two cell lines diminished.
Indicative of apoptosis, cleavage of pro–caspase-9 was observed
after 8 h treatment with PYR-41 in C8 cells, but not in A9 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S8). Thus, p53-expressing transformed cells
are relatively more susceptible to apoptotic cell death induced by
PYR-41. However, as might be expected for a reagent with
pleotrophic effects, p53-negative cells are not immune to the
effects of this reagent when examined at longer times after
exposure. This likely reflects the roles of ubiquitylation in

regulating numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle and
NF-nB activation.

Discussion
PYR-41 and related pyrazones are the first described reagents
that enter cells, inhibit the ubiquitin E1, and differentially kill
transformed cells. Thus, they represent the basis for a potential
new class of therapeutics, as well as new tools to probe the
functions of the ubiquitin system. For example, PYR-41 has brought
to light the reciprocal relationship between ubiquitylation and
sumoylation, which we confirmed in tsE1 cells and will now
stimulate research into the molecular basis for this relationship.
We have also shown that, when ubiquitylation is inhibited, EGFR
phosphorylation is prolonged and receptor down-regulation is
attenuated. Again, these findings should allow for further
evaluation of the complexities of the relationship between
phosphorylation and ubiquitylation in tyrosine kinase signaling
pathways.
One potential limitation of PYR-41 is specificity. Our data
indicate that there is no substantial inhibition of E2 or caspases.
Furthermore, we find no evidence for inhibition of cellular
neddylation, and net cellular sumoylation actually increases,
consistent with our findings in tsE1 cells. However, there seems
to be partial inhibition of HECT domain E3s in vitro, whether
PYR-41 actually inhibits these enzymes in cells remains to be

Figure 5. PYR-41 inhibits NF-nB activation. A, HeLa cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter under the control of a NF-nB response element and treated
with IL-1a for 2 h with or without pretreatment of PYR-41 for 30 min. Lysates were assessed for luciferase activity. Data represents standard derivation of three
independent experiments. B, HeLa cells were treated with PYR-41 (50 Amol/L) for 15 min and then stimulated with IL-1a (10 ng/mL) for 5 min. Immunoprecipitates
were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and membranes were immunoblotted. The asterisk represents heavy chain of immunoglobulin. C, HeLa cells were pretreated with
PYR-41 for 10 min before IL-1a stimulation (10 ng/mL) for the indicated times. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies specific for InBa or phosphorylated InBa.
D, 2B4 T-cell hybridoma cells were incubated with DMSO, PYR-41 (50 Amol/L), or a peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor, ALLN (50 Amol/L), for 15 min before
treatment with TNF-a where indicated. Note the higher molecular weight forms indicative of InBa ubiquitylation that are seen only when TNF-a–induced degradation is
inhibited by proteasome inhibitor.

Inhibitors of the Ubiquitin E1 that Induce Apoptosis

determined. Regardless, further structure-activity relationships and
modeling will be required to generate reagents with greater
specificity. Thus, use of this reagent must be carried out with the
understanding that it can have other as yet unknown effects.
It will also be of interest, and critical to future structure–
activity relationship studies, to conclusively establish the molecular basis on how PYR-41 inhibits E1. Its structure, the apparent
irreversible nature of E1 inhibition, and the quenching of activity
by a marked excess of free thiols together provide strong
circumstantial evidence that PYR-41 functions by blocking the
active site cysteine of E1. Molecular modeling based on a partial
structure of the ubiquitin E1 (41) is consistent with such a
mechanism.6 Attempts to definitively establish whether this is the
case are ongoing.
A major question that arises from our studies is the potential to
use inhibitors of E1 as therapeutics in cancer. There is some

skepticism regarding their potential utility stemming from their
predicted effects on multiple proteins and pathways. This is in
contrast to the current emphasis on development of highly specific
targeted therapeutics (42–45). To date, however, Hdm2 is the only
E3 for which specific inhibitors have been reported (8–11), and the
general feasibility of inhibiting specific E3s remains an area of
debate in the ubiquitin and oncology communities (7). The wellfounded emphasis on highly targeted therapeutics not withstanding, it is now evident that drugs that have more general effects on
protein fate can have significant therapeutic indices. Among these
are geldanamycin and related ansamycins that inhibit Hsp90
(46, 47). Because of its ability to target EGFR for degradation,
17-AAG, a geldanamycin derivative, is being actively evaluated in
breast cancer and other malignancies. Proteasome inhibitors were
first developed with the idea of inhibiting muscle wasting and
cachexia. With the realization that they could inhibit the activity of
the prosurvival transcription factor NF-nB by preventing ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of InB after its
phosphorylation by IKK, proteasome inhibitors have been evaluated for use in the treatment of cancer. Bortezomib, the first of

the proteasome inhibitors in clinical use, is now being used for
treatment of multiple myeloma and is under evaluation for other
B-cell lymphomas (12).
PYR-41 and related pyrazones also affect the fate and activity of
proteins implicated in a number of different cellular processes. As
they inhibit both proteasomal and nonproteasomal functions of
the ubiquitin system, the range of processes targeted by E1
inhibitors are potentially greater than those affected by proteasome
inhibitors. For example, PYR-41 directly affects NF-nB activation at
multiple steps. These include inhibiting formation of K63-linked
polyubiquitin chains essential to activation of IKK, as well as by
blocking ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of InB,
wherein proteasome inhibitors are predicted to act. Thus, one
potential advantage of using an E1 inhibitor therapeutically might
be in inflammatory processes or malignancies associated with
increased activation of NF-nB.
Most importantly, PYR-41 also has a striking capacity for
inhibiting loss of p53 and increasing levels of the p53-induced cell
cycle inhibitor p21. Further, we find that PYR-41 differentially targets
p53-positive cells for apoptosis. This suggests that even considering
the multiple effects of this reagent, the presence of wild-type p53
represents a dominant determinant of susceptibility to cell death.
Whether this holds up, as additional model systems are assessed and
additional E1 inhibitors are evaluated, will be of great interest.
The identification of PYR-41 and related pyrazones as
inhibitors of the ubiquitin E1 represents an important step

forward in developing leads for preclinical evaluation of inhibitors
of E1 in cancer and potentially other diseases. PYR-41 increases
the level of a cell cycle inhibitor, activates p53, and inhibits NF-nB
activation. All of these are desirable effects for a cancer
therapeutic. However, as is the case for proteasome inhibitors,
inhibitors of the ubiquitin E1 are also predicted to result in
undesirable effects on protein dynamics. Thus, it will be critical to
determine, on a case-by-case basis, how E1 inhibitors might be
best used when evaluated in preclinical models.
There is clearly much more to be done to determine whether
inhibitors of E1 can be efficacious therapeutics and the extent to
which their specificity can be optimized. The identification and
characterization of PYR-41 as a cell permeable inhibitor of this
critical enzyme represent an important first step.
