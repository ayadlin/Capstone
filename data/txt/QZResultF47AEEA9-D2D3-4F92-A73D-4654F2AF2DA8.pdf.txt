Abstract

Author Manuscript

Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a cellular sensor that controls cytosolic DNA-activated
innate immune signaling. We have previously demonstrated that STING-deficient mice are
resistant to carcinogen-induced skin cancer, similar to myeloid differentiation primary response
gene 88 (MyD88) deficient mice, since the production of STING-dependent DNA-damageinduced proinflammatory cytokines, that likely require MyD88 signaling to exert their growthpromoting activity, are prevented. In contrast, MyD88-deficient mice are sensitive to colitisassociated cancer (CAC), since selected cytokines generated following DNA-damage also activate
repair pathways, which can help prevent tumor development. Here, we demonstrate that STING
signaling facilitates wound repair processes and that analogous to MyD88-deficient mice, STINGdeficient mice (SKO) are prone to CAC induced by DNA-damaging agents. SKO mice harboring
tumors exhibited low levels of tumor-suppressive interleukin-22 binding protein (IL-22BP)
compared to normal mice, a cytokine considered critical for preventing colon-related cancer. Our
data indicate that STING constitutes a critical component of the host early response to intestinal
damage and is essential for invigorating tissue repair pathways that may help prevent
tumorigenesis.

The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against pathogen infection
though can also influence pathways than can control tumorigenesis.1,2 For example, it is
known that the cellular adapter MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88)
that facilitates Toll-like receptor and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling pathway in the
innate immune response can regulate tumorigenesis through control of nuclear factor-κB
(NF-κB) activation, cytokine secretion and inflammation.2 Mice lacking MyD88 are
resistant to carcinogen (7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)) induced skin cancer
since MyD88-controlled cytokine and growth factor production, which augments skin

tumorigenesis is averted.3 Of note is that the mechanisms underlining carcinogen-driven
cytokine production largely remain unknown.

Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a cellular protein that is critical for activating the
production of various cytokines such as type I interferon in response to the detection of
microbial double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) or cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs).4–6 In addition,
self-DNA is also capable of activating STING-dependent signaling and this pathway has
now been shown to play a key role in the cause of a variety of autoinflammatory diseases.7,8
Recently, it has been further reported that STING-dependent cytokine production can be
induced by DNA-damaging agents, including DMBA. It was observed that DMBA caused
nucleosome release into the cytosol to trigger STING activity.9 STING was found to control
the expression of cytokines requiring MyD88 signaling for the extended production of
proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α.9 Thus, STING-deficient mice
were observed to be resistant to DMBA-aggravated skin carcinogenesis, similar to MyD88deficient mice.9

However, MyD88-deficient mice are known to be susceptible to colitis-associated
carcinogenesis (CAC) induced by drugs such as azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate
sodium (DSS).10 AOM is the metabolite of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and is converted
to methylazoxymethanol, which mediates O-methylguanine formation to trigger DNA
damage responses.11 A single injection of AOM into mice, followed by administration of the
inflammatory agent DSS via drinking water induces almost 100% colon cancer. In this
situation, MyD88 exerts a protective effect in part by facilitating the production of
interleukin-18 (IL-18), in epithelial cells, which downregulates dendritic cell production of
the interleukin-22 (IL-22) binding protein (IL-22BP).12 IL-22BP suppresses the function of
IL-22 which is produced from innate lymphoid cells in response to cellular/tissue damage
and which potently stimulates the proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells.

We have previously demonstrated that the cellular protein STING facilitates cytosolic DNAtriggered innate immune signaling pathways, independent of Toll-like receptor 9 or the DNA
sensor absent in melanoma 2 (AIM II).13 In humans, STING is a 348 amino acid
endoplasmic reticulum-associated molecule predominantly expressed in epithelial cells as
well as cells of the hematopoietic lineage, that has been shown to play a key role in
triggering innate immune signaling pathways in response to infection by viruses such as
herpes simplex virus 1, and even bacteria.4 STING has also been shown to be responsible for
triggering vascular and pulmonary syndrome, self-DNA-induced inflammatory diseases such
as Aicardi–Goutieres syndrome and perhaps forms of severe systemic lupus
erythematosus.8,14–16 STING may associate with dsDNA species directly and is highly
activated by CDNs (cyclic di-GMP-AMP[cGAMP-c(G(2′,5′)pA(3′,5′)p)]) generated by
certain bacteria or by cytosolic dsDNA triggering the activation of a synthase, referred to as
cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, C6orf150, Mab-21 domain-containing protein).6
Given that STING appears to play a pivotal role in controlling a variety of inflammationdriven events and may control MyD88-dependent carcinogen-induced skin cancer, we
wished to address the role of STING in inflammation-aggravated intestinal tumorigenesis.
Using the AOM/DSS model, we observed that similar to MyD88, STING-deficient mice

(SKO) are sensitive to CAC indicating a protective role for STING in tumorigenesis. Our
data indicate that STING may be a key sensor that promotes the elimination of damaged
intestinal epithelial cells.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Activation of STING-dependent genes by AOM

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Given that chronic inflammation is known to aggravate colon cancer and that STING has
been shown to influence inflammatory responses, especially those invoked by cytosolic self
or pathogen-related DNA, we examined the role of STING in the control of inflammatory
CAC.1,2,15 Toward these objectives, we utilized the AOM/DSS model and analyzed the
effects of AOM and precursor DMH on STING signaling. Principally, wild-type (WT) or
STING-deficient (SKO) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were treated in vitro with
DMH or metabolite AOM for 8 h, and microarray analysis performed to analyze the
consequences to gene expression. This study indicated that AOM activated mRNA
production of a wide array of innate immune-related genes in WT cells, including
interferon-induced protein with tetratricopep-tide repeats 3 (IFIT3) and chemokine (C-X-C
motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2) (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 1). However, there was a
marked decrease in the production of the same genes in SKO MEFs indicating that AOM
was indeed capable of activating the STING pathway (Figure 1a, left panel). A similar effect
was observed following the treatment of cells with DMH (Figure 1a, right panel). STINGdependent gene expression was confirmed following RT–PCR analysis of mRNA
representing Cxcl10 and IFIT3 (Figure 1b). We similarly treated normal human colon
epithelial cells (FHCs) with AOM and observed a comparable induction of innate immune
genes, controlled by STING, including Cxcl10 (Figure 1c). The production of Cxcl10 by
AOM was similarly reduced in FHCs treated with RNAi to STING (Figure 1d). To
determine the consequences of DMH/AOM treatment on STING’s ability to activate these
key transcription factors, we carried out immunofluorescence analysis on MEFs and FHCs
treated with these drugs. This study indicated that DMH/AOM could instigate the
translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3/NF-κB in treated cells (Supplementary Figure
2). Thus, the DNA-damaging agent DMH/AOM can invoke STING-dependent signaling.
Loss of STING renders mice susceptible to CAC

Author Manuscript

Our data indicate that DMH/AOM can activate STING in vitro. To examine the
consequences of this in vivo, we treated mice once with AOM and subsequently orally with
four treatments of DSS. Prior to this, we analyzed STING expression in the intestine by
immunohistochemistry analysis. This study showed that STING was expressed in lamina
propria cells as well as in endothelial and epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract (Figure
1e). After 13 weeks the mice were analyzed for tumor development in the colon.
Surprisingly, we observed that SKO mice developed colonic tumors at a much higher
frequency compared to WT mice (Figures 2a–c and Supplementary Figure S3). Indeed, 4/7
WT mice exhibited tumor formation compared to 7/7 SKO within the same time period
(Figures 2b and c and Supplementary Figure S3a). Hematoxylin and eosin analysis
confirmed that AOM/DSS-treated SKO mice exhibited significant inflammatory cell
infiltration and development of adenocarcinoma in the colon, compared to similarly treated

WT mice (Figures 2d and e and Supplementary Figure S3b). However, Microarray analysis
indicated that tumors from WT mice exhibited higher levels of selected gene expression,
such as Cxcl13 and Ccr6, compared to tumors retrieved from SKO mice, perhaps since loss
of STING suppressed immunomodulatory transcriptional events (Figures 2f–h). Collectively,
we postulate that STING may recognize damaged DNA and activate the production of
cytokines that conceivably could promote tissue repair or stimulate the immune system to
eradicate such cells. Thus, loss of STING may enable damaged cells to escape immune
surveillance processes and progress more readily into tumors.
Suppression of IL-22BP expression in STING-deficient mice

Author Manuscript

Although, we demonstrated that loss of STING facilitated colon cancer development, the
tumor-suppressive mechanisms associated with STING activity remain to be clarified. It
remained plausible that STING could exert direct tumor-suppressive, growth inhibitory or
pro-apoptotic properties similar to tumor suppressor p53. Further, AOM treatment has been
known to induce frequent Ras mutations, which in the context of loss of STING, could
facilitate cellular transformation.17 Expression of oncogenic Ras in an environment where
p53 function is lost renders normal murine cells, the ability to form foci in soft agar and to
become tumorigenic in vivo.18 To evaluate the anti-oncogenic role of STING further, we
transfected WT, SKO or p53-deficient MEFs, as positive controls, with Myc or activated Ras
and monitored cellular transformation. MEFs lacking p53 were found to be readily
transformed by the introduction of Myc or activated Ras (Supplementary Figure S4).
However, MEFs lacking STING did not appear appreciably sensitive to transformation
following overexpression of Myc or activated Ras. Thus, the absence of STING does not
appear to exert an oncogenic stimulus, at least in vitro or to cooperate with Myc or Ras in
the cellular transformation process.

However, it has been demonstrated that mice lacking certain cytokines such as IL-18, IL-22
or the innate immune adapter MyD88 are similarly susceptible to AOM/DSS-induced
CAC.1,2,10,12 In this situation, MyD88 exerts a protective effect by facilitating the
production of IL-18 through the IL-18R, which is required to inhibit IL-22BP.3,12,19–22
IL-22BP is necessary to suppress IL-22 function, which can promote the proliferation of
intestinal epithelial cells following damage by carcinogens or inflammatory agents.12 Mice
lacking IL-18 or IL-22BP are highly susceptible to CAC, similar to STING-deficient mice.12
To examine whether AOM/DSS treatment could affect IL-18 and IL-22BP expression in
SKO mice, we analyzed IL-18 and IL-22BP levels in untreated normal mice (control) or
tumor tissue taken from the AOM/DSS-treated WT or SKO mice. We observed that IL-18
expression was slightly upregulated in tumor tissue retrieved from WT mice treated with
AOM/DSS (Figure 2i). We observed that IL-22BP expression levels were also elevated in
the tumors of AOM/DSS-treated WT mice. In contrast, we noted the significantly reduced
expression of IL-18 and IL-22BP in the tumors of SKO mice, when compared to WT mice
(Figure 2i). The expression of IL-22 was seen to remain relatively unaffected (data not
shown). It was surprising to note that IL-22BP levels were elevated in the presence of IL-18.
However, it has been reported that the downregulation of IL-22BP can occur even in the
absence of IL-18, indicating that alternate STING-induced cytokines may clearly contribute
to the regulation of IL-22BP.12

In addition, we noted from our microarray analyses that IL-18 levels were reduced in SKO
MEFs treated with STING-activating dsDNA (dsDNA90 base pairs; Figure 3a, left panel).
We therefore investigated the involvement of STING on the possible regulation of the IL-18/
IL-22BP axis. First, we confirmed the influence of STING on IL-18 expression, since we
additionally noted that the promoter of this cytokine is known to harbor numerous sites
recognized by innate immune gene-activating transcription factors such as signal transducer
and activator of transcription 1, NF-κB, IRF1 and IRF7 (Supplementary Figure S5). Our
analysis indicated that IL-18, which is expressed in a wide variety of cell types, is a STING
inducible gene, as determined following treatment of MEF cells and bone marrow-derived
dendritic cells (BMDCs) with dsDNA or STING-activating CDNs (cGAMP; Figure 3a,
middle and right panel). A similar study indicated that DMH/AOM could also trigger the
production of IL-18 in dendritic cells, in a STING-dependent manner (Figure 3b). To further
this study, we examined IL-22BP expression in BMDCs stimulated with IL-18 recombinant
protein and observed the upregulation of IL-22BP in WT BMDCs compared to SKO
BMDCs (Figure 3c and Supplementary Figure S6). These data are similar to Figure 2i
showing that IL-18 and IL-22BP expression levels were also lower in the tumors of AOM/
DSS-treated SKO mice compared to the tumors of WT mice (Figure 2i). These data suggest
that STING may regulate IL-22BP expression by IL-18.
Taken together, it is conceivable that DNA damage or the sensing of microbial ligands that
may invade damaged colon tissue can trigger STING activity leading to the activation of
inflammatory wound repair initiating cytokines as well as the indirect suppression of growth
inhibitory IL-22BP. Our data thus indicate that similar to mice lacking MyD88, IL-18 or
IL-22BP, STING-deficient mice are also prone to CAC induced by AOM/DSS.

Although, we demonstrate here a protective role for STING in the prevention of CAC
induced by AOM/DSS carcinogenic treatment, these findings are in contrast to our previous
data indicating that STING-deficient mice are resistant to DMBA-induced skin cancer.9 In
this scenario, DNA-leaked from the nucleus of carcinogen damaged dermal-associated cells
activates STING-dependent cytokine production, intrinsically, to attract infiltrating
phagocytes. Such phagocytes engulf dying cells to activate extrinsic STING-dependent
cytokine production, which further drives inflammatory processes that promote tumor
development.9 This situation is reminiscent of similarly treated MyD88-deficient mice,
which are also resistant to DMBA-aggravated skin cancer. Our data indicate that STING
triggers the production of cytokines that bind to receptors requiring MyD88-dependent
signaling for additional cytokine production, such as tumor necrosis factor α.3 Our data here
conversely indicate that STING-driven cytokine production can protect against the
development of other types of tumors, such as carcinogen-influenced colon cancer.23 This
event may occur in part through STING’s ability to control the production of IL-22BP,
although STING clearly controls the production of numerous other regulatory proteins and
cytokines. Following tissue damage, for example by DSS, it has been reported that IL-22 is
induced and manifests protective, wound-healing effects, including the promotion of tissue
regeneration.1,2,10,12 However, if left uncontrolled, IL-22 can also endorse tumor
development.12 IL-22 is therefore tightly regulated by secreted IL-22BP, which is expressed
by CD11c+ dendritic cells.12 The importance of IL-22BP in controlling IL-22 has been
emphasized through observing that IL-22BP-deficient mice are also susceptible to AOM/

DSS-induced CAC, similar to STING-deficient mice.12 Nevertheless, IL-22 may have dual
functions since mice lacking IL-22 have also been reported to exhibit enhanced
inflammatory responses when treated repeatedly with DSS, plausibly because complete loss
of IL-22 may cause a delay in intestinal repair, which in turn may actually aggravate
inflammatory processes.1,2,10,12 The production of IL-22BP can be suppressed by IL-18,
which is known to be induced early after DSS-induced intestinal damage. Accordingly,
IL-18-deficient mice are also susceptible to colon cancer, presumably through chronic
suppression of IL-22 activity, by unregulated IL-22BP, which may mimic the situation
observed with IL-22-deficient mice.12 Nevertheless, the control of IL-22BP remains to be
fully clarified since downregulation of IL-22BP has also been reported to occur in the
absence of IL-18.12 In addition, it is known that loss of the Toll-like receptor and IL-1R/
IL-18R adapter MyD88 also renders mice sensitive to CAC, in part due to loss of IL-18R
signaling.20,21 Finally, susceptibility to AOM/DSS-induced CAC has been shown to be
enhanced in mice lacking caspase-1, the adapter PYCARD (apoptosis-associated speck-like
protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain; ASC) or nucleotide-binding
domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing proteins 3 and 6 (NLRP3/6),
presumably since Pro-IL-18 produced by epithelial cells or dendritic cells requires cleavage
prior to secretion into an active form.24–26

Our data here indicate that IL-18 and a variety of other cytokines and chemokines are
inducible by dsDNA or CDN’s, or by AOM/DMH in a STING-dependent manner. Similar to
the situation with IL-22, we propose that intestinal damage triggers STING activity (as a
consequence of DNA damage or even from microbial ligands such as secreted CDNs or
genomic DNA). This results in the downregulation of IL-22BP, which would enable IL-22 to
promote tissue repair. However, similar to the situation with IL-22, long-term loss of STING
may delay wound repair, facilitate microbial invasion and chronic inflammation, which
would actually aggravate tumorigenesis.1,2,12 In addition, loss of STING may enable
damaged cells to escape antitumor immunosurveillance.2 It was noted that IL-18 expression
was not totally ablated in tumors from SKO mice, presumably since the expression of this
cytokine could be induced by other pathways.12 Despite this, IL-22BP levels remained low
in SKO mice evidently demonstrating the importance of STING in IL-22BP regulation.
Collectively, our data indicate that STING plays a key role in controlling intestinal tissue
damage and CAC in part through regulating IL-22BP’s suppression of IL-22. Our data also
provide a mechanistic explanation for carcinogenic-induced immunomodulatory effects that
can influence tumorigenesis.

Loss of STING renders mice susceptible to CAC. (a) Schematic representation and body
weight of AOM/DSS-induced colitis model. WT (n = 7) and SKO (n = 7) mice (B6;129 mix)
were intravenously injected with AOM at a dose 10 mg/kg. After 1 day, mice were fed 5%
DSS in drinking water for 7 days. This cycle was repeated four times. Normal drinking
water was used for control group. At 91 days, micro-endoscopic procedure was performed in
a blinded manner for counting number of polyps. Mice were killed at day 121 and the colon
was resected, flushed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in formalin for histology or froze
for RNA expression analysis. Representative photographs of macro-endoscopic colon

tumors (b) and number of polyps (c). Hematoxylin and eosin staining (d) of WT (n = 7) and
SKO (n = 7) mice either AOM/DSS treated or normal water treated and inflammation score
(0: normal to 3: most severe; e). (f) Gene array analysis of normal tissue (control) and tumor
tissue (DSS/AOM) from WT and SKO mice treated same as a. Rows represent individual
genes and columns represent individual samples. Pseudo-colors indicate transcript levels
below (green), equal to (black) or above (red) the mean. Scale represents the intensity of
gene expression (log2 scale ranges between – 2.4 and 2.4). (g) Highest variable gene lists are
shown. (h) qPCR of Cxcl13 and Ccr6 in normal tissue (control) and tumor tissue (DSS/
AOM) from WT and SKO mice treated same as a. (i) qPCR analysis of IL-18 and IL-22BP
(IL-18: Mm00434225, IL-22BP: Mm01192969) from normal tissue (control) and tumor
tissue (DSS/AOM) from WT and SKO mice. Data are the mean of at least five mice. Error
bars indicate s.d. *P<0.05, Student’s t-test.

IL-18 controls IL-22BP in STING-dependent manner. (a) Fold changes from gene array
analysis of IL-18 in WT and SKO MEFs administered with 4 ug/ml of dsDNA90 and IFNβ
for 8 h (left). qPCR analysis of IL18 in WT and SKO MEFs, and bone marrow-derived
dendritic cells (BMDCs) transfected with 4 μg/ml of dsDNA90 and cyclic-di-GMP-AMP
(cGAMP) for 8 h (middle). (b) qPCR analysis of IL-18 in WT and SKO BMDCs with 1 mM
of AOM and 1 mM of DMH for 8 h. (c) qPCR analysis of IL-22BP in WT and SKO BMDCs
treated with 10 ng/ml of recombinant mouse IL-18 protein (MBL B002-5) for 24 h. Total
RNA was reverse transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase. qPCR was performed
using TaqMan gene expression assay (IL-18: Mm00434225, IL-22BP: Mm01192969). Data
are the mean of at least five mice. Error bars indicate s.d. *P<0.05, Student’s t-test.
