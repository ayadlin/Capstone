RPA Inhibition Increases Replication Stress and Suppresses
Tumor Growth

Abstract
The ATR/Chk1 pathway is a critical surveillance network that maintains genomic integrity during DNA
replication by stabilizing the replication forks during normal replication to avoid replication stress. One of
the many differences between normal cells and cancer cells is the amount of replication stress that occurs
during replication. Cancer cells with activated oncogenes generate increased levels of replication stress. This
creates an increased dependency on the ATR/Chk1 pathway in cancer cells and opens up an opportunity to
preferentially kill cancer cells by inhibiting this pathway. In support of this idea, we have identiﬁed a small
molecule termed HAMNO ((1Z)-1-[(2-hydroxyanilino)methylidene]naphthalen-2-one), a novel protein interaction inhibitor of replication protein A (RPA), a protein involved in the ATR/Chk1 pathway. HAMNO
selectively binds the N-terminal domain of RPA70, effectively inhibiting critical RPA protein interactions that
rely on this domain. HAMNO inhibits both ATR autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of RPA32 Ser33 by
ATR. By itself, HAMNO treatment creates DNA replication stress in cancer cells that are already experiencing
replication stress, but not in normal cells, and it acts synergistically with etoposide to kill cancer cells in vitro
and slow tumor growth in vivo. Thus, HAMNO illustrates how RPA inhibitors represent candidate
therapeutics for cancer treatment, providing disease selectivity in cancer cells by targeting their differential
response to replication stress. Cancer Res; 74(18); 5165–72. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
One of the intrinsic features that distinguish cancer cells
from surrounding normal cells is a deregulated cell cycle.
Common cancer-associated mutations in genes such as p53,
Myc, Rb, and EGFR in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) promote a promiscuous S-phase entry, which
leads to higher levels of replication stress (1–6). Replication
stress occurs when the replication fork encounters aberrant
DNA structures. Although these structures may differ greatly,
they all lead to the formation of long stretches of ssDNA that
are bound with replication protein A (RPA), the main eukaryote ssDNA binding protein (7, 8).
The major structural feature of heterotrimeric RPA is the
presence of the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding
(OB) folds within each of its six DNA binding domains
(DBD). This OB fold structure consists of b sheets, forming
b-barrel structures that wrap around ssDNA, a common

feature in ssDNA binding proteins (9, 10). These OB folds are
responsible for RPA's binding to long stretches of ssDNA,
making RPA one of the ﬁrst responders in the replication
stress response. RPA has several functions other than stabilizing ssDNA. One of these functions is to recruit and
interact with proteins needed for an effective replication
stress response, including ATRIP, RAD17, RAD9, and NBS1
(11–15). This occurs via the OB fold located on the Nterminal of RPA70 (RPA1), DNA binding domain F (DBDF), which unlike the other OB folds on RPA70 is primarily a
protein-binding domain. Recruitment of ATRIP, RAD17,
RAD9, and NBS1 leads to the loading of TOPBP1 to stalled
forks, which stimulates the kinase activity of ATR (11, 12, 15).
This triggers a complex network of signaling pathways
involved in cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and apoptosis that mediates the cellular response to replication stress.
In the context of cancer therapy, the activation of these
signaling pathways can limit the therapeutic efﬁcacy of
radiation and chemotherapeutics and enhance the survival
of cancer cells (16).
The presence of higher replication stress in cancer cells
compared with normal cells provides a therapeutic opportunity to target RPA. On the basis of observations of a DNAdamage response in early-stage cancerous lesions, two laboratories proposed a model referred to as the oncogene-induced
DNA-damage model for cancer development, which posited
that deregulation of growth regulation genes induces DNA
replication stress and DNA damage (16–18). Their initial
analyses provided evidence that loss of heterozygosity in

early-stage lesions was due to oncogene-induced replication
stress preferentially targeting chromosomal fragile sites. More
recent studies have supported these initial observations and
provided more evidence of the presence of DNA replication
stress in human cancers. These studies were able to examine a
very large cancer specimen sample size using high-throughput
genomic analyses to show that the most common deletions
occur at fragile sites in large genes, and these deletions can be
attributed to replication stress (19, 20). Combined, these
results provide a strong foundation for developing a novel
therapeutic approach that exploits the endogenous replication
stress intrinsic to cancer cells (21).
Here, we present the identiﬁcation and development of a
small-molecule inhibitor that inhibits the protein interaction
domain of RPA70 involved in the replication stress response. By
targeting the cellular response to replication stress via RPA, we
demonstrate that this approach is particularly toxic to cells
that harbor cancer-associated mutations, which promote
resistance to conventional chemotherapies.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
HAMNO ((1Z)-1-[(2-hydroxyanilino)methylidene]naphthalen2-one), also known as NSC111847, was acquired from the
Developmental Therapeutics Program of the NCI. The primary antibody for RPA32 was purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. The primary antibodies for ATR and ATRPT1989 were purchased from Genetex. Primary antibodies
for RPA32-PS4S8, RPA32-PS33, and GAPDH were purchased
from Bethyl Laboratories. The Alexa Fluor 680 and Alexa
Fluor 488 secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. The IRDye700-labeled polyT 30mer oligonucleotide
and complementary polyA 30mer oligonucleotides were
purchased from IDT.
Docking simulations
The Molegro Virtual Docker Program (CLC bio) was used to
dock HAMNO to the DBD-F in silico. The HAMNO structure
used for docking was created using Open Babel. The model of
DBD-F chosen for docking was a modiﬁed version of the
original crystal structure (PDB:2B29) optimized for ligand
binding (22, 23). The entire protein structure was used for
modeling under default conditions, resulting in ﬁve simulating
dockings of high predictive afﬁnity. Docking data and results
are included in Supplementary Data.
Immunoﬂuorescence and Western blot
For immunoﬂuorescence studies, UMSCC38 cells were
grown overnight before drug treatment, ﬁxed and permeabilized with 100% ice-cold methanol for 10 minutes, washed and
blocked 10% goat serum and 1% BSA in PBS for 30 minutes at
room temperature and the primary antibodies to PS139-H2AX
were applied in blocking solution for 1 hour at room temperature. An Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated secondary antibody was
then incubated in blocking solution for 1 hour at room
temperature. Cells were mounted in PermaFluor (Fisher)
supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Roche). Images were captured digitally with a Zeiss

5166

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

Axiovert 200 M microscope, and scored using Mathematica
software (Wolfram) as follows. DAPI staining was used to
deﬁne the region of interest (ROI). H2AX signal within the
ROI was determined and background intensity calculated from
outside the ROI for each nuclei. A total of 200 cells were assayed
per condition. Statistical analysis was then performed with
Prism software (Graphpad). For Western blot, whole-cell
lysates were separated by SDS–PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with primary antibodies to
RPA32, followed by Alexa Fluor 680–conjugated anti-rabbit.
Images were obtained with an Odyssey Imager (LI-COR).
Cells and clonogenic assays
The squamous cell carcinoma cell lines UMSCC38 and
UMSCC11B (kindly obtained from Dr. Thomas G. Carey, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) were propagated in DMEM
with 10% FBS. The immortalized primary oral keratinocyte cell
line, OKF4 (obtained from Dr. James G. Rheinwald, Harvard
Institutes of Medicine, Boston, MA), was propagated in fortiﬁed KBM-2 media (Lonza) with 10% FBS (Hyclone). For
clonogenic assays, cells were trypsinized and diluted in media
to 1,000 cells/mL, then dispersed into 60-mm dishes (3 mL)
overnight. After addition of HAMNO, cells were grown for 9
days, then ﬁxed in PBS containing 6% glutaraldehyde for 30
minutes, and then dyed in 0.5% crystal violet for 30 minutes and
rinsed. Colonies containing over 50 cells were counted. For
studies requiring etoposide, HAMNO was added 1 hour before
addition of 2 mmol/L etoposide. After 2 hours of etoposide
exposure, media were removed and rinsed with PBS, before
adding back media containing HAMNO. Data were analyzed
using an unpaired 2-tailed Student t test to determine statistical signiﬁcance.
Protein puriﬁcation and electrophoretic mobility shift
assays
RPA was puriﬁed using a published protocol as described
(24). DBD-F fused to maltose binding protein was generated
and puriﬁed as described (22). Quality of both proteins was
assessed by SDS–PAGE, followed by coomassie staining (22).
For ssDNA binding studies, 7 nmol/L RPA was added to 10
nmol/L labeled polyT 30mer in electrophoretic mobility shift
assays (EMSA) buffer (10 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmol/L KCl,
10% glycerol) for 10 minutes at 25 C. Samples were run on 1%
agarose gels in 40 mmol/L Tris-Acetate buffer, pH 7.5, and then
scanned on an infrared scanner. For DNA unwinding assays, 14
nmol/L RPA was added to 10 nmol/L PAGE puriﬁed annealed
polyA:polyT 30mer oligonucleotides.
Flow cytometry
Cell-cycle assessment and g-H2AX staining were monitored
in UMSCC38 and OKF4 cells after 2-hour incubation with
HAMNO and ﬁxed in 70% ethanol overnight. Cells were washed
with PBS and incubated overnight in PBS containing 1%
BSA, 10% goat serum and PS139-H2AX antibodies (Millipore),
washed and incubated in goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647
antibody for 30 minutes at RT. Cells were incubated in
50 mg/mL propidium iodide and 100 mg/mL RNase A for
30 minutes, and 10,000 cells per sample were analyzed on a

BD FACSarray and WinList (Verity House) software were used
for data collection and analysis, respectively.
Xenograft tumor model
Athymic nude mice were purchased from NIH and housed at
the animal facility at the UNMC College of Dentistry. UMSCC38
and UMSCC11B cells were implanted into 6-week-old female
mice by a single subcutaneous injection of tumor cells (2–6 
105 cells in 100 mL of sterile PBS). The growth rates of tumors
were determined by daily monitoring of tumor volume with
vernier calipers [tumor volume ¼ 1/2(length  width2)]. Once
the tumor size reached 50 mm3, etoposide (10 mg/kg mouse)
and HAMNO (2 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally
every day for 3 days. Tumor size was monitored daily and the
volume of the tumor was compared among all experimental
groups. At least three mice were used per group. Data were
analyzed using an unpaired 2-tailed Student t test to determine
the statistical signiﬁcance.

Results
HAMNO is selective for DBD-F
HAMNO (Fig. 1A) was ﬁrst identiﬁed as an RPA DBD-F
inhibitor in a high-throughput screen (HTS) that determined
the ability of a small molecule to dissociate a RAD9–GST fusion
protein from an RPA–ssDNA complex, an interaction that
requires DBD-F (25). Binding of HAMNO to DBD-F was further
investigated through in silico methods (Fig. 1B). These studies
used a crystal structure of DBD-F (23) that was earlier optimized for binding to the in vitro DBD-F inhibitor, fumaropimaric acid (FPA; ref. 22). The site of highest predicted afﬁnity
was to a position immediately adjacent to R43 on DBD-F (Fig.
1B, right), where the compound would predictively act to
hinder protein–protein interaction, as this residue is essential
for DBD-F protein binding (11).
To conﬁrm an interaction of HAMNO with DBD-F in vitro,
we took advantage of the ability of DBD-F to weakly bind a
labeled oligonucleotide, and looked for changes in mobility and
intensity of the complex in the presence of HAMNO using an
EMSA (Fig. 1C; ref. 22). In the absence of DBD-F, HAMNO does
not bind labeled oligonucleotide (Fig. 1C, left). In the presence
of both DNA and DBD-F, the addition of HAMNO results in the
formation of a band between the free ssDNA and proteinbound ssDNA bands (Fig. 1C, right; denoted by an asterisk). As
HAMNO is uncharged at neutral pH, it is unlikely that binding
of the compound to the protein–DNA complex alone would
result in this newly formed band detected on the gel. Rather,
this stimulation of DBD-F binding to DNA by HAMNO suggests
a direct interaction of the small molecule with DBD-F, resulting
in a conformational shift that alters DNA binding.
We then wanted to conﬁrm that HAMNO is selective for
inhibiting only DBD-F, and not DBDs A-E, which are important
in RPA binding to ssDNA. This selectivity would ensure that
HAMNO would affect protein recruitment more adversely than
ssDNA binding. To determine this, we took advantage of a DNA
unwinding activity by RPA that is dependent on the DBD-F, but

effect on the mobility of a single-stranded polyT-30mer. Right, addition of
HAMNO to DBD-F complex with polyT-30mer results in the appearance
of a band of increased mobility (denoted by asterisk), a result of HAMNO
interacting with the DBD-F/DNA complex. Concentrations of DBD-F and
DNA are 5 nmol/L and 100 nmol/L, respectively. Concentrations of
HAMNO are 50, 100, 150, 200 mmol/L. D, HAMNO prevents DBD-F–
dependent unwinding of DNA by RPA (left), but does not prevent RPA
ssDNA binding (right). Concentrations of drug are 200, 100, 50, 25,

does not require DBD-F for stable binding of the resultant
ssDNA that is formed (22, 26). To do this, we used EMSAs with
full-length RPA using ssDNA and dsDNA probes. HAMNO did
not affect RPA binding to ssDNA at concentrations up to 200
mmol/L, but prevented dsDNA unwinding and subsequent
ssDNA binding at 100 mmol/L (Fig. 1D). This inhibition of
dsDNA unwinding by HAMNO is nearly equivalent to that by
our previously identiﬁed in vitro inhibitor, FPA, whose subsequent dissociation constant for DBD-F was determined to be
9.0 mmol/L (22). Together, these data show a preference of
HAMNO for selectively inhibiting DBD-F at micromolar levels,
an ability that would predictively target the replication stress
response in replication-stressed cancer cells over normal cells.

these proteins would likely short-circuit ATR signaling, leading
to increased replication stress that can be monitored by pannuclear phosphorylation of H2AX in S-phase (29–31). This type
of phosphorylation has been shown to be S-phase–speciﬁc as
previously demonstrated with CHK1 inhibitors (32) and differs
from the punctate foci that occur in response to double-strand
breaks. We evaluated whether HAMNO induces replication
stress as assessed through increases in pan-nuclear g-H2AX
staining (Fig. 2A). After UMSCC38 cells were exposed to
HAMNO, increased pan-nuclear g-H2AX staining occurred in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and B). When H2AX phos-

phorylation was assessed via Western blot, cancer-derived
UMSCC38 cells, as well as another cancer cell line, UMSCC11B,
had prominent g-H2AX staining, particularly after incubation
with 20 mmol/L HAMNO. In contrast, the telomerase-immortalized keratinocyte cell line, OKF4, did not show enhanced
g-H2AX staining at this concentration, suggesting that
HAMNO is more effective in inducing H2AX phosphorylation
in cancer cell lines that are potentiated for oncogene-induced
stress. To further validate that pan-nuclear g-H2AX represents
replication stress and the difference in replication stress
between HNSCC cells and OKF4 cells is S-phase–speciﬁc, we
used ﬂow cytometry. To measure cell-cycle–speciﬁc g-H2AX
staining, we assayed cells in the absence of HAMNO as a
negative control, which determined the threshold between
g-H2AX–positive and g-H2AX–negative cells for each cell-cycle
phase (Fig. 2D). Both UMSCC38 and OKF4 cells presented
increased g-H2AX staining after addition of HAMNO, with the
greatest increase in signal occurring in S-phase (Fig. 2D). In
further comparison of the two cell lines, the ratio of g-H2AX–
positive to g-H2AX–negative cells in S-phase was 6- to 8-fold
greater in UMSCC38 cells than OKF4 cells at 20 mmol/L and
50 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that
HAMNO selectively increased g-H2AX staining in S-phase,
indicative of increased replicative stress. These data also
indicate that cells predicted to have high levels of oncogeneinduced stress, such as mutant p53 squamous cell carcinoma cells, are selectively potentiated for increased replication
stress by HAMNO.
HAMNO affects RPA and ATR phosphorylation
Inhibition of DBD-F by HAMNO is expected to inhibit
RPA32 phosphorylation directly by inhibiting DBD-F interactions with replication stress response proteins involved
in activating ATR (11, 12, 15, 27, 28, 33, 34). We tested this
hypothesis under conditions that enhance RPA32 Ser33
phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Ser33 of RPA32, an ATR substrate,
is highly phosphorylated after 2 hours of treatment with
20 mmol/L of etoposide, which was reduced with the addition
of 2 mmol/L HAMNO, and was nearly absent at higher concentrations, demonstrating an in vivo effect of HAMNO as
an inhibitor of RPA32 phosphorylation by ATR.
Ser33 phosphorylation primes further phosphorylation of
the N-terminus of RPA32 at other sites, including Ser4 and Ser8
by ATM and DNAPK, a requirement for competent RPAdependent signaling (35–37). We tested whether inhibition of
Ser33 phosphorylation would then inhibit phosphorylation of
these downstream sites. As with Ser33, HAMNO also reduced
phosphorylation of Ser4 and Ser8 after etoposide treatment
(Fig. 3B).
The increase in g-H2AX staining and decrease in RPA
phosphorylation in HAMNO-treated cells suggest a deregulation of ATR signaling. To further describe this loss of competent DNA damage response (DDR) signaling, we assessed the
autophosphorylation of ATR at T1989, a marker for ATR
activity (Fig. 3C; refs. 38, 39). As expected, etoposide strongly
induced ATR autophosphorylation, whereas treatment with
HAMNO alone showed a slight increase in T1989 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the addition of etoposide and HAMNO

Small-Molecule Inhibition of RPA

Discussion

Figure 3. HAMNO alters RPA32 and ATR phosphorylation. A and B,
etoposide increases RPA32 phosphorylation at S33 (A) and S4/8 (B) in
UMSCC38 cells, which is reduced in the presence of increasing
concentrations of HAMNO. C, HAMNO induces ATR
autophosphorylation at T1989, but to a lesser extent than etoposide.
When HAMNO and etoposide are added simultaneously, ATR is
phosphorylated to a lesser extent than etoposide treatment alone,
indicating a decrease in ATR signaling.

together resulted in a decrease in ATR autophosphorylation as
compared with etoposide alone, suggesting that ATR activity
has been compromised. Taken together, these data show that
HAMNO inhibits RPA32 phosphorylation and decreases ATR
autophosphorylation, indicative of HAMNOs ability to affect
ATR signaling.
HAMNO enhances etoposide toxicity
The ability of HAMNO to inhibit ATR signaling suggested
that the compound may be cytotoxic, and sensitizes cells to
DNA-damaging agents. HAMNO alone inhibited colony formation in both HNSCC cell lines in the low micromolar range
(Fig. 4A). Next, we compared the colony formation of UMSCC38
cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of HAMNO
with or without an initial 20 mmol/L/2-hour exposure to
etoposide (Supplementary Fig. S1). When these two conditions
are normalized to the 0 mmol/L HAMNO treatment, HAMNO
combined with etoposide signiﬁcantly inhibited colony formation to a greater degree than HAMNO alone (Fig. 4B). To further
examine the potential of HAMNO as an anticancer agent, we
tested HAMNO in a mouse xenograft model. In mice, HAMNO
slowed the progression of UMSCC11B tumors (Fig. 4C). This
inhibition was also seen in mice cotreated with sublethal
etoposide as well as in similarly treated UMSCC38 cells (Fig.
4D and E). These results raise the exciting possibility that a
DBD-F inhibitor alone can reduce tumors or can sensitize
tumor cells to other chemotherapy agents.

The inhibition of the ATR–CHK1 pathway has gained prominence as a potential therapeutic intervention for cancer. This
strategy has the potential to strike at the disease in a multitude
of ways. First, ATR inhibition alone increases replication stress,
even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, which is
ampliﬁed in cells with active oncogenes or mutated tumor
suppressors, resulting in cell death (30, 32). Second, ATR
inhibition restrains replication and G2–M checkpoints, prematurely pushing cells along the cell cycle and increasing
genomic instability (30). Third, ATR inhibition may act with
synthetic lethality with cancers cells that have an incomplete
or incompetent repertoire of DNA repair mechanisms (40).
Therefore, the inhibition of ATR and CHK1 will have powerful
consequences in the cell.
One major disadvantage of ATR–CHK1 inhibition is the off
target effects that are not related to the replication stress response or the DDR, as both kinases phosphorylate hundreds of
proteins, many of which are not DDR related (41, 42). CHK1
expression is essential for mouse embryonic cell survival, indicating that ATR and CHK1 inhibition would negatively affect
normal cells (43). ATR and CHK1 null mice are embryonic lethal,
further implicating that the inhibition of ATR–CHK1 directly
may have unwanted consequences in the organism (44, 45).
Therefore, a downstream ATR substrate that speciﬁcally modulates the replication stress response, such as RPA, may be a
more appropriate target for cancer treatment. Inhibition of
RPA phosphorylation by HAMNO allows the replication stress
response–speciﬁc aspects of ATR signaling to be inhibited,
allowing other aspects of ATR signaling to remain unimpeded.
Before the discovery of RPA protein inhibitors, inhibitors of
RPA–ssDNA interaction have been characterized and have
been shown to be cytotoxic and act with synergy with cisplatin,
displaying the potential for RPA as a drug target (46, 47). The
discovery of several other DBD-F binding proteins further
increased the potential of such an inhibition (11, 14). Our
pursuit of DBD-F inhibitors through HTS resulted in the ﬁrstidentiﬁed in vitro inhibitor, FPA (25). FPA inhibited the DBD-F
with high afﬁnity and selectivity, but had a preponderance of
high negative charge that restricted the compound from
crossing cell membranes (22, 25). Souza-Fagundes and colleagues also used both HTS and a fragment-based nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy method to identify in vitro
inhibitors of RPA with afﬁnities similar to FPA (48, 49).
HAMNO, with its neutral charge and hydrophobic ring structures, allows passage of the compound through the cell membrane, where it can bind to DBD-F, an improvement over FPA.
The ability of HAMNO to work effectively with etoposide
attests to the effective strategy of inducing replication stress
and reducing the replication stress response to increase cell
death selectively in cancer cells that have constitutive DNA
replication stress. This approach would be beneﬁcial in the
clinic, as the therapeutic efﬁcacy would increase with the
addition of an RPA inhibitor and reduce unwanted side effects.
HAMNO also has the potential to be used as a stand-alone agent
due to its ability to selectively increase cytotoxicity in cancer
cells that already have oncogene-induced replicative stress.

This is the ﬁrst in vivo study showing the potential of an RPA
DBD-F inhibitor as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent. The
ability of HAMNO to induce cytotoxicity alone and kill cells
synergistically with etoposide suggests that HAMNO could be
used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic
agents. HAMNO is tolerated in mice at doses that affect tumor
growth, attesting to the clinical potential of this compound.
The structure of HAMNO allows for the addition and substitution of many possible moieties that could result in increased
afﬁnity to the DBD-F. We are currently testing several HAMNO
derivatives for increased DBD-F inhibition.
