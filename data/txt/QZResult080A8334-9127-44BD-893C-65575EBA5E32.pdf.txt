Abstract
Ascorbate is a pro-oxidant that generates hydrogen peroxide–dependent
cytotoxity in cancer cells without adversely affecting normal cells. To determine the
mechanistic basis for this phenotype, we selected Burkitt lymphoma cells resistant
to ascorbate (JLPR cells) and their ascorbate-sensitive parental cells (JLPS cells).
Compared with JLPS cells, the increased glucose uptake in JLPR cells (with upregulated
glucose transporters, increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and altered cell cycling)
conferred ascorbate–induced cytotoxicity and resistance. Transcriptomic profiles
and function pathway analysis identified differentially expressed gene signatures
for JLPR cells and JLPS cells, which differential expression levels of five genes
(ATF5, CD79B, MHC, Myosin, and SAP18) in ascorbate-resistant cells were related to
phosphoinositide 3 kinase, cdc42, DNA methylation and transcriptional repression,
polyamine regulation, and integrin-linked kinase signaling pathways. These results
suggested that coordinated changes occurred in JLPR cells to enable their survival
when exposed to the cytotoxic pro-oxidant stress elicited by pharmacologic ascorbate
treatment.

Introduction

specific cytotoxicity [10]. Pharmacologic ascorbate
has been found to mediate the mitochondrial release of
cytochrome C, which leads to H2O2-mediated activation
of the caspase cascade and apoptotic process and thence
to a significant decrease in the growth rate of some solid
tumors [11–14]. Herst investigated that 5 mM ascorbate
in combination with radiation killed more glioblastoma
multiforme primary cells by increasing oxidative DNA
damage than either treatment alone [15]. However,
the effect of high doses of intravenous ascorbate in the
treatment of cancer has been controversial although there
is growing evidence that intravenous high-dose ascorbate
has been found to improve the health-related quality of life
of terminal cancer patients [16,17].
On another hand, some normal human cells
(lymphocytes, monocytes, fibroblasts and normal breast
cells) and some types of human cancer cells (breast cancer
cells and glioblastoma multiforme cells) are more resistant
to ascorbate than others [8, 9]. Moreover, ascorbate
penetrating the tissue at a slightly lower rate than mannitol

Ascorbate (Vitamin C) is a nutrient essential
to the biosynthesis of collagen and L-carnitine and
the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine [1].
Most animals are able to synthesize large quantities of
ascorbate, but humans lost this ability due to mutations
of the gulonolactone oxidase gene [2]. It is well known
that an acute lack of ascorbate leads to scurvy and causes
death [3] and ascorbate is an attractive marker of fruit
and vegetable intake because these foods are the primary
sources of dietary vitamin C [4], which ascorbate functions
as a potent reducing agent that efficiently quenches
potentially damaging free radicals [5]. It is very interesting
that Cameron suggested that high doses of ascorbate could
provide a clinical benefit for cancer patients [6, 7]. In vitro
studies have shown that pharmacologic ascorbate is
effective in a large panel of tumor cell lines [8, 9] and
that increasing tumor cells’ generation of hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) might be used to induce ascorbatewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and travelling via the paracellular route were also found
[18]. Compared with human renal carcinoma TC-1 cells,
higher intracellular glutathione concentration was detected
in glioblastoma multiform tumor T98G cells, which were
more resistant to ascorbate than TC-1 cells [9]. Sinnberg
also found that ascorbate resistance was associated with
the expression of HIF1α and oxygen pressure [19].
Therefore, the use of ascorbate as an anticancer agent
and ascorbate-induced resistance warrants further study.
The mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer cells have
been thoroughly studied at the gene transcription levels
by cDNA microarrays, which is a high-throughput system
developed to monitor the expression of many genes in
a single experiment and to identify genes differentially
expressed in multidrug-resistant cancer cells and those
of their parental cells [20–22]. In this study, we used
transcriptomic profiling, quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and antioxidant enzyme
activity assays to clarify the molecular mechanism of
ascorbate-induced resistance in Burkitt lymphoma cells.

were 1.72- and 1.77-fold higher, respectively, than those in
JLPS cells (Figure 2B). We found that following treatment
with ascorbate and H2O2, the amount of glucose uptake
in JLPS cells was usually significantly lower than that in
JLPR cells (P < 0.05). The amount of 2-DG uptake was
decreased by 78.57% (from 35 to 7.5 pmoles 2-DG/min/106
cells) in JLPS cells treated with 1000 μM ascorbate or
25 μM H2O2 (Figure 2C and 2D). Our results demonstrated
that ascorbate treated with cancer cells by the role of H2O2
in mediating glucose uptake activation in JLPS cells. On
the other hand, the resistant JLPR cells maintained high
glucose uptake (about 55 pmoles 2-DG/min/106 cells)
despite being treated in 1 mM ascorbate (Figure 2C) or
25 μm H2O2 (Figure 2D). These results suggested that
ascorbate resistance actively restores glucose uptake
against H2O2-induced apoptosis and necrosis.

Increased levels of antioxidant enzyme (CAT and
GPX) mRNA, protein, and activity in JLPR cells
qRT-PCR was used to assess the levels of
antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression. The expression
levels of CAT and GPX4 mRNA in JLPR cells were higher
than those in the JLPS cells (Figure 2E). Immunoblots
analysis revealed CAT protein levels to be higher in JLPR
cells than JLPS cells (Figure 2F). The CAT and GPX
activities of JLPR cells (CAT: 59.6 nmoles/min/106 cells;
GPX: 538.6 nmoles/min/106 cells) were 1.5 and 2 times
as high as those of JLPS cells (CAT: 42.3 nmoles/min/106
cells; GPX: 253.6 nmoles/min/106 cells), respectively
(Figure 2G and Figure 2H). These results were consistent
with the findings regarding mRNA and protein levels.
These findings indicated that the activities of the CAT
and GPX enzymes are involved in protecting cells against
oxidative stress, which suggests that overexpression of
CAT and GPX confers resistance to ascorbate.

Results
Cytotoxic response of JLPS and JLPR cells to
ascorbate or H2O2
Using the MTT assay, we found that JLPR cells
were highly resistant to ascorbate and H2O2 at IC50
values of 1250 μM and 32 μM, respectively (Figure 1A,
Figure 1B, and Table 1). High-performance liquid
chromatography analysis revealed that JLPR cells had a
larger amount of ascorbate than JLPS cells did (Figure 1C).
JLPS cells incubated with 1 mM docosahexanoic acid
(DHA) for 1 h had a similar amount of ascorbate as
JLPR cells did (Figure 1C). Because cellular ascorbate
cannot induce the death of JLP cells, there was almost no
difference in cell viability rates between JLPS cells treated
with ascorbate and JLPS cells treated with ascorbate
and DHA (Figure 1A). JLPS cells pretreated with CAT
acquired some resistance to ascorbate (Figure 1A). After
48 h, JLPR cells that had not been maintained in 1 mM
ascorbate lost little H2O2 resistance (Figure 1B). These
results suggested that ascorbate efflux has an antioxidation
function that protects cells from H2O2-induced cytotoxicity
and that ascorbate resistance is associated with progressive
accumulation of reactive oxygen species.

Ascorbate and H2O2 trigger similar models of
cell cycling, but JLPR cells do not arrest in the
G2/M phase induced by ascorbate or H2O2
Propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry were
used to assess the DNA content of untreated and ascorbateor H2O2-treated JLPS cells and JLPR cells. Following
treatment with 1 mM ascorbate or 20 μM H2O2, JLPS cells
were arrested predominantly in the G2/M phase; a few cells
arrested in the G1 phase (Figure 3A and 3B). These results
demonstrated that JLPS cells arrest at the G2/M phase,
whereas JLPR cells do not, which implied that JLPR cells
are more effective in removing H2O2 from the treatment
medium. Interestingly, the cell cycling of JLPS cells
treated with ascorbate was basically identical to that of
JLPS cells treated with H2O2. These findings indicated that
JLPS cells, but not JLPR cells, arrest in the G2/M phase in
response to ascorbate or H2O2 and that ascorbate and H2O2
trigger similar models of cell killing in JLPS cells.

Increased glucose uptake in JLPR cells with
activation of glucose transport
The amount of 2-DG uptake at different times in
JLPR cells was higher than that in JLPS cells (Figure 2A).
To determine whether the changes in glucose transport
occurred at the level of gene transcription, we analyzed the
expressions of Glut1 and Glut3. Real-time PCR revealed
that the expression levels of Glut1 and Glut3 in JLPR cells

Transcriptomic profiles in JLP cells
To identify possible mechanisms of ascorbate
resistance, we performed gene microarray profiling of
JLPS and JLPR cells. A genome-wide analysis of the gene
transcripts expressed in both cell lines was performed
using agilent array. Hybridization of the microarray data
revealed that 1.82% of the cDNAs exhibited more than a
1.5-fold change in expression level (P ≤ 0.05). The genes
and genetic networks involved in ascorbic resistance are
described in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The microarray
experiments also revealed that the following genes

Functional networks and pathways of ascorbateinduced drug resistance

are expected to be affected during ascorbate resistance
development in Burkitt lymphoma cells. The differentially
expressed genes belong to five canonical signaling
pathways that are frequently deregulated in ascorbateresistant cells (Table 3).

The genetic networks and cellular pathways
deregulated in JLPR cells were identified using the IPA
software program. Expression microarray profiling studies
revealed that 45 genes were deregulated in JLPR cells
(Supplementary Table S1). A comprehensive network and
pathway analysis of the deregulated genes revealed that
these genes were associated with two network functions
and five canonical pathways relevant to the development
of ascorbate resistance in cancer cells. In each of the
two genetic networks, the differently expressed genes
constituted about half of the molecules involved in
network-associated cellular functions and included genes
related to cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cell
death, hematological system development and function,
and immune cell trafficking (Table 2). These genes

and H2O2 exposed to JLPR cells resulted in reduced
cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, but increased glucose
uptake compared with that in JLPS cells. We also found
that Glut1 and Glut3 were primarily responsible for
glucose transport in JLPR cells and that the amounts of
these transporters were higher in JLPR than JLPS cells.
Smith et al. found that increased glucose transport was
associated with fluorouracil resistance in MCF7 cells and
that Glut1 was increased in fluorouracil-resistant cells
[26]. These results imply that JLPR cells overcame the
role of H2O2 in mediating glucose uptake activation by
activation of the expression of glucose transporters. We
also investigated whether ascorbate treatment of JLPR
and JLPS cells resulted in different patterns of gene
regulation with oxidative stress pathways induced by
reactive oxygen species. After treatment with ascorbate,
the expression of c-Myc was downregulated in JLPR
cells but overexpressed in JLPS cells (Figure 4D). c-Myc
activation can induce sufficient DNA damage to elicit a
stress response and induce the accumulation of cells with a
4N DNA content [27], which is consistent with our finding
that JLPS cells treated with ascorbate induced sufficient
DNA damage to cause cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase.
Following treatment with ascorbate, cleaved PARP was
present in JLPS cells and native PARP was overexpressed
in JLPR cells. We further analyzed the functional networks

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that resistance
to ascorbate reduced drug accumulation, decreased
apoptosis, and increased glucose transport, anti-oxidation
activity, and DNA repair. Compared with JLPS cells,
JLPR cells generated smaller amounts of ROS than JLPS
cells with ascorbate treatment (Figure 3C). Produced
intracellularly as a byproduct of oxidative metabolism,
under normal conditions H2O2 is reduced to water by
CAT, GPXs, and peroxiredoxins [23]. In contrast, JLPR
cells had a wide array of enzymatic and non-enzymatic
antioxidants, including GPX, CAT, and glutathione. Other
studies have revealed that CAT activity increases in H2O2resistant fibroblasts and that cell death is prevented by
cellular or extracellular CAT [24, 25]. Overexpression of
the corresponding genes may dramatically increase cells’
resistance to the ascorbate-induced oxidative damage of
lipids, proteins, and DNA.
In our study, we found that JLPR cells were resistant
to H2O2 and that the effects elicited by ascorbate or H2O2
in these cells were strikingly similar. Moreover, ascorbate

and gene pathways involved in ascorbate resistance.
Although only five genes (CD79B, ATF5, Myosin, MHC,
and SAP18) with similar and overlapping signature
patterns were represented in the signaling pathways
(phosphoinositide kinase signaling, Cdc42 signaling,
DNA methylation and transcriptional repression signaling,
polyamine regulation signaling, and integrin-linked kinase
signaling), each of their gene products are functionally
involved in controlling cell growth and cell death and
have been suggested to play roles in ascorbate resistance
in JLPR cells. Real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis
confirmed the expression of ATF5 in JLPR cells. ATF5,
which is part of the ATF/cAMP-response element-binding
protein gene family, may play a role in protecting cells
from amino acid limitation or arsenite-induced oxidative
stress. Previous studies have shown that ATF5 loss-offunction induces glioma cell death in culture and in vivo
[28, 29]. Taken together, these results suggested that
ATF5 induces ascorbate resistance in lymphoma cells by
activating transcription factors.
In conclusion, we found that in parental JLPS cells—
but not in JLPR cells—treatment with pharmacologic
ascorbate or H2O2 induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M
phase and PARP cleavage, decreased glucose uptake, and
activated c-Myc pathway. In addition, the gene expression
profiles of JLPS cells and JLPR cells were different. The
differentially expressed genes in microarrays, which
mediated multiple cytotoxic pro-oxidant stress pathways,
were also verified at the levels of mRNA, protein, and
functional activity by real-time PCR, western blotting,
and enzyme activity analyses, respectively. These target
genes from vitamin C–induced resistant cells may serve as
novel biomarkers for identifying cancer patients who may
benefit from pharmacologic ascorbate treatment.

microinjected into the cells. Calibration curves were
obtained by measuring the amount of O2 released in the
medium.

Assessment of glucose transport
After JLPS and JLPR cells (2 × 106) were treated
with ascorbate or H2O2, the cells were washed with PBS
and incubated with 250 nM 2-deoxy-D-[1,2-3H] glucose
(2-DG) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS containing phloretin (100 µM),
and dissolved in 300 μl of 0.1 N NaOH, 1% CHAPS.
2-DG uptake was measured using a scintillation counter.

Measurement of intracellular ascorbate, CAT,
and glutathione peroxidase (GPX)
After JLPS and JLPR cells were incubated with
ascorbate, the cells were washed with PBS and harvested.
The cell pellets were resuspended in 60% methanol and
centrifuged at 15,300 rpm for 20 min. A HPLC system was
used to assess the amount of intracellular ascorbate. For
CAT activity, JLPS and JLPR cells (1.5 x 106 cells) were
centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The cell pellet
was sonicated in 300 μl of cold buffer comprising 50 mM
potassium phosphate and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min. CAT activity in
20 μl of the resulting supernatant was assessed using a CAT
assay kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Intracellular GPX4 activity
was measured using a cellular GPX assay kit (Calbiochem)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Transcriptomic profiles
After quality assessment using the Agilent
NanoChip Bioanalyzer assay, total RNA from cell lines
was labeled using Agilent’s Low RNA Input Labeling Kit,
which involves reverse transcribing the mRNA to produce
cDNA and then transcribing in the presence of Cy3-CTP
or Cy5-CTP to produce labeled cRNA. Labeled cell line
cRNA was paired with the differentially labeled normal
colonic epithelial cRNA and, using the Agilent In situ
Hybridization Kit, hybridized to the Agilent 44K Whole
Genome Oligo Microarray (G4112A) for 17 hours at
60°C according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The arrays
washed in 2X SSC, 0.005% Triton × 102 for 10 minutes,
0.006 × SSPE, 0.005% N-lauroylsarcosine and coated with
Agilent’s Stabilization and Drying Solution. Arrays were
scanned on Agilent DNA Microarray scanner.

Materials and Methods
JLPS and JLPR Burkitt lymphoma cells
The Burkitt lymphoma cell line JLPS and
ascorbate-resistant JLPR cells were maintained in RPMI
1640 medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA, USA) with
10% inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 50 μM
b-mercaptoethanol. JLPR cells were maintained with 1 mM
ascorbate. To develop cells resistant to ascorbate, we
incubated JLPS cells with ascorbate in a stepwise manner,
gradually increased from 100 µM to 1 mM over 6 months.

O2 electrode assay of H2O2 concentration
The amount of H2O2 in the culture medium was
measured using an O2 electrode (Hansatech Instruments,
Ltd., Norfolk, UK) as described previously (24). Tested
samples of cell culture medium that had been treated with
1 mM ascorbate or H2O2 for various times were placed
in the reaction cells. After equilibration of the samples,
100 μl of catalase (CAT) solution (10,000 U/ml) was
