ABSTRACT
Aerobic glycolysis is one of the important hallmarks of cancer cells and
eukaryotic cells. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between blocking
mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) with UK5099 and the metabolic alteration as well
as stemness phenotype of prostatic cancer cells. It was found that blocking pyruvate
transportation into mitochondrial attenuated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) and increased glycolysis. The UK5099 treated cells showed significantly
higher proportion of side population (SP) fraction and expressed higher levels of
stemness markers Oct3/4 and Nanog. Chemosensitivity examinations revealed
that the UK5099 treated cells became more resistant to chemotherapy compared to
the non-treated cells. These results demonstrate probably an intimate connection
between metabolic reprogram and stem-like phenotype of LnCap cells in vitro. We
propose that MPC blocker (UK5099) application may be an ideal model for Warburg
effect studies, since it attenuates mitochondrial OXPHOS and increases aerobic
glycolysis, a phenomenon typically reflected in the Warburg effect. We conclude that
impaired mitochondrial OXPHOS and upregulated glycolysis are related with stem-like
phenotype shift in prostatic cancer cells.

prevalent in cancer cells [2, 3]. Warburg concluded that
upregulated glycolysis was likely due to dysfunctional
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [4].
Although this hypothesis has been challenged due to the
findings that upregulated glycolysis in some cancers is
not accompanied by detectable mitochondrial defects [5].
There actually exists a fine interplay between glycolysis and
mitochondrial metabolism [6–8].
Recent studies have shown mutations in enzymes
of the Krebs cycle in the etiology of some cancers, which

INTRODUCTION
In the recent years, tumor cells exhibiting a metabolic
reprogramming, known as the Warburg effect, has been
attracting general attention in cancer research, wherein
glycolysis is drastically upregulated with concomitantly
increased lactate acid production even in the presence
of oxygen [1]. Research done in the past decades has
confirmed what Warburg observed and measured more than
90 years ago, was largely correct and nearly universally

suggest that dysfunctional mitochondria OXPHOS is
a required step for cancer development at least in some
cancer types [9, 10]. Multiple mechanisms attribute to
dysfunctional OXPHOS, but it is already noticed that
metabolism of pyruvate plays a central role [11].
Pyruvate, a critical molecule for mitochondrial
OXPHOS, links the glycolytic pathway with the
mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle and plays an
important role in this metabolic reprogramming. In most
differentiated mammalian cells, pyruvate was processed
from glucose in the cytosol and thereafter was directed
into mitochondrial and oxidized for efficient ATP
production. While in cancer cells, pyruvate was converted
to lactate by aerobic glycolysis in most cases, the so-called
Warburg effect, which is inefficient but seems to enable
cancer cell proliferation [12].
Pyruvate enters mitochondria through a recently
identified mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), a 150kDa complex of MPC1 and MPC2 located on the inner
mitochondrial membrane, which transports pyruvate across
the inner mitochondrial membrane and to the mitochondrial
matrix [13–15]. Absence of either MPC1 or MPC2 leads to
a loss of mitochondrial pyruvate uptake and utilization [16].
It is well known that UK5099 (acyano—(1-phenylindol-3yl)-acrylate is an inhibitor of MPC, which inhibits the MPC
by specifically modifying a thiol group on the carrier [17].
Two studies demonstrated that the undifferentiated
stem cells showed suppressed mitochondrial activity
[18, 19]. Vazquez-Martin A reported induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPS) exhibit a glycolytic metabolic phenotype
[20]. Given the observation that decrease in pyruvate
oxidation may be associated with the Warburg effect, and
different types of stem cells exhibit a glycolytic metabolic
phenotype [21, 22], we asked whether reduced MPC
activity with UK5099 resulted in aerobic glycolysis and
was correlated with high stemness phenotype of prostatic
cancer cells. We are probably the first to use UK5099 to
block MPC in prostate cancer cells, in consideration of its
effect on cell stemness. We assessed its effect on metabolic
phenotypes and stemness-like features. It was found that
UK5099 enhanced aerobic glycolysis and decreased
mitochondrial OXPHOS in LnCap cell in vitro. This was
accompanied by increasing proportion of side population
(SP) fraction, higher level of stemness markers expression
and exhibiting high resistance to chemotherapy. Our
results verify that MPC blocker UK5099 enhances stemlike phenotype of prostatic cancer cell through metabolic
shift from OXPHOS to aerobic glycolysis.

cell line LnCap, mitochondrial pyruvate concentration of
LnCap cells treated with UK5099 was determined firstly.
As shown in Figure 1, application of UK5099 significantly
reduced the pyruvate concentration in mitochondria
(p = 0.03). It was therefore confirmed that UK5099 acts as
a MPC inhibitor in LnCap cells.

UK5099 suppressed proliferation and arrested
cell cycle at G1/G0
Cell growth of prostate cancer cell line LnCap
treated with UK5099 was evaluated by cell counting at
variable time points. Growth curves were also generated.
As shown in Figure 2A, UK5099 suppressed the cell
proliferation in LnCap cells.
The effect of UK5099 on cell cycle distribution
of LnCap cells was further analyzed. As shown in
Figure  2B, and 2C, LnCap cells treated with UK5099
show significantly increased percentage of G1/G0 phase
(P = 0.0067) and decreased percentage of S (P = 0.0084)
and G2/M phases (P = 0.0031) compared with the control
cells, indicating an effect of G0/G1 phase arrest of
UK5099 on LnCap cells.

UK5099 promoted mitochondrial dysfunction
and enhanced aerobic glycolysis
To gain insight into the mitochondrial OXPHOS and
relative utilization of glycolysis in UK5099 treated cells,
oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP, reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane
potential (ΔΨm) were examined (Figure 3).

OCR
OCR in UK5099 treated cells was examined using
a Seahorse XF-24 extracellular flux analyzer. OCR
under basal conditions and maximal respiration in the
presence of FCCP (an uncoupling agent that allows
maximal electron transport) are shown in Figure 3A.
Basal cellular OCR and maximal OCR of UK5099
treated cells were found to be significantly lower than
that in the control cells Figure 3A. In the presence of
FCCP, a concomitant increase of 244.6 ± 27.4 pmol/min
in OCR was observed in the control cells, while there
was only a slight increase (103.9 ± 48.6 pmol/min) in
the UK5099 treated cells. The increase was considered
as respiratory reserve capability, i.e. maximal OCR
minus basal OCR. This implies that at basal levels, the
UK5099 treated cells were operating closer to maximal
OCR capacity, which resulted in a lower reserve
capacity. Lower respiratory reserve capacity is also
linked to lower mitochondrial fidelity. We were able to
identify that UK5099 promoted defective mitochondrial
function, indicated by low basal OCR and a lack of
response to FCCP.

ATP production and lactic acid level

with UK5099 show dysfunctional mitochondria in contrast
to the LnCap control cells.

To understand whether there was ATP generation
alteration in the cells treated with UK5099, we next
analyzed ATP production. As shown in Figure 3C, cells
treated with UK5099 produced significantly less ATP
(p = 0.0013). Next we sought to characterize the glycolytic
rate in these cells. We used EnzyChrome lactate assay
kit to determine the medium and cellular lysate lactic
acid levels. It was found that extracellular lactic acid
production increased significantly in the medium while
intracellular lactic acid production was not influenced
(Figure 3B), indicating a higher glycolytic efflux in
the cells treated with UK5099 which tend to rely on
glycolysis, thus produced more lactic acid.

Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm)
ΔΨm is an important measure of how the
mitochondria are functioning [24]. ΔΨ of LnCap cells
treated with UK5099 was assessed using JC-1. As shown
in Figure 3E, the ΔΨm of LnCap cells treated with
UK5099 is significantly lower than that in the LnCap
control cells.
All the above results showing lower OCR, ATP
production, ΔΨm and higher of extra cellular lactic acid
efflux and higher ROS production indicate that UK5099
treatment result in mitochondrial OXPHOS dysfunction
and the UK5099 treated LnCap cells are forced to rely
on glycolysis to survive, even in the presence of normal
oxygen concentration (normoxia).

ROS generation
To provide evidence about mitochondria function
influence when treated with UK5099, we sought to
determine whether UK5099 could directly affect ROS
production in LnCap cells. As shown in Figure 3D,
ROS production in LnCap cells treated with UK5099 is
about 2 times higher than that in the LnCap control cells
(p < 0.001), further indicating that LnCap cells treated

in the UK5099 treated cells compared to the control
cells Figure 4A, (p = 0.005). In the presence of
verapamil, the increase in SP was largely abrogated,
suggesting that ABCG2 is at least partially responsible
for the increase in side population, although it remains
possible that other drug pumps could play a role in
UK5099-treatment induced side population. Compared

DISCUSSION

higher expression levels of MPC1 and MPC2 compared
to DU145 and PC3 (Data not shown). We therefore
applied LnCap cell line for further study in this project.
The comparatively higher level of MPC1 and MPC2
expressions in LnCap cells may indicate rather better
mitochondrial function in these cells compared to the
DU145 and PC3 cells, since both DU145 and PC3 cells
are more malignant than LnCap cells.

MPC1 and MPC2 gene expression has been
investigated in cell lines like embryonal, heatologic,
ovarian and colorectal cancer cell lines. The expression
levels are variable depend on different cell lines [25].
MPC1 and MPC2 gene expressions were assessed in
prostatic cancer cell lines LnCap, DU145 and PC3
firstly in our lab, and it was found that LnCap exhibited

*vs control p < 0.05.

In our study, it was confirmed that UK5099 blocked
pyruvate transportation into mitochondria in LnCap cells
by analyzing the mitochondrial pyruvate concentrations.
Upon UK5099 application, OCR, ATP production and
membrane potential were significantly decreased and the
extracellular lactate acid efflux and ROS production were
significantly increased in the UK5099 treated cells. All
results are in line with impaired mitochondrial OXPHOS
status and enhanced aerobic glycolysis in the UK5099
treated LnCap prostatic cancer cells.
The Warburg effect or named as aerobic glycolysis
wherein glycolysis was upregulated even in the presence
of oxygen is now recognized as an important hallmark
of cancers. Research done in the past 15 years has
confirmed the prevalence of Warburg effect [5, 11, 26].
Warburg also hypothesized that the increased glycolysis
was due to mitochondrial dysfunction [4]. However, the
mechanisms leading to the increased rate of glycolysis
are debatable and only partially understood currently. But
there actually exists a fine interplay between glycolysis
and mitochondrial metabolism as reported in literature. It
was discovered that suppressing aerobic lactate production
by stably knocking-down lactate dehydrogenase
directly impacted mitochondrial respiration. Cells with
decreased LDH-A activity showed an increase in oxygen
consumption and OXPHOS activity [6, 7]. It was also
clear that acute overexpression of lactate dehydrogenase-A
could perturb cell mitochondrial metabolism and insulin
secretion [6, 7].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Warburg-like metabolic changes were once
considered as a mere consequence of the aberrant
cancer cell growth, while in the recent research, it was
demonstrated that this metabolic reprogramming has
cancer-causing activity [27]. Yi Zhu and his group
identified that the nucleophosmin (NPM1) can promote
Warburg effect. NPM1 was also found up-regulated in
pancreatic cancer, and indicated a poor prognosis in their
study [28]. While in other hand, the results of a colon
cancer model study reported by Bianchi et al imply that
glucose and amino acid deficiency conditions imposed
by short term starvation promote an anti-Warburg effect
characterized by increased oxygen consumption but
failure to generate ATP, resulting in oxidative damage
and apoptosis [3]. RRAD, a small GTPase, was found to
repress the Warburg effect through negatively regulating
the NF-κB signaling and inhibit the GLUT1 translocation.
The expression of RRAD is frequently down-regulated in
lung cancer and is associated with tumor progression and
poor prognosis as Liu J et al reported [29].
Mitochondria are a central hub for biosynthesis of
amino acids, nucleic acids and lipids, and are the main
providers of NADH and NADPH. They play a key role
in the context of cancer metabolic reprogramming. Many
vital cellular parameters are controlled by mitochondria.
These include regulation of energy production, generation
of ROS, and maintaining mitochondrial membrane
potential and so on. Defects in mitochondria, caused
by mtDNA depletion or others, can result in metabolic
37764

Oncotarget

reprogram, which is in accordance with our result. For
example, Yu M et al showed that breast tumor cell line
lacking mtDNA generated increased levels of lactate with
concomitantly reduced oxygen consumption and ATP
production[30].
Defects in mitochondrial metabolism can initiate
a complex cellular reprogramming that supports tumor
initiation and growth [31, 32]. Increasing evidence has
shown that mitochondrial dysfunction provides survival
advantage to cancer cells [31, 33–35]. In addition,
mtDNA-depleted cells display a decreased sensitivity to
chemotherapeutic drugs and resistant to apoptosis induced
by staurosporine and anti-Fas antibody [30].
There are indications that mitochondrial function is
associated with cell stemness. Changes in the parameters
like ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential, which
controlled by mitochondrial function, can impinge on
biosynthetic pathways, cellular signal transduction
pathways, transcription factors and chromatin structure
to shift the cells between a quiescent, differentiated
state and an actively proliferating one [24]. As a critical
molecule for mitochondrial OXPHOS, modulation of
pyruvate metabolism is vital for the maintenance of stem
cell populations [36, 37]. It is reported that antimycin
A was used to inhibit complex III of the mitochon­
drial respiratory chain, indicating that the inhibition of
mitochondrial OXPHOS may prevent differentiation of
human embryonic stem cell [3]. Mitochondrial function
of iPS cells is drastically altered during the process in
acquiring embryonic features, which impacts the cellular
bioenergetics profile wherein the metabolism is shifted
from OXPHOS to glycolysis and returns to OXPHOS
during subsequent iPS cells differentiation [20].
We have observed that UK5099 has the ability to
expand the side population. In theory, the cells within a
population that display higher efflux of DNA-binding dye
Hoechst 33342 via ABCG2 constitute the SP. In multiple
cancers these cells have been observed to be more cancer
stem cell-like. Thus, UK5099-induced expansion of the
SP could serve as an evidence of a potentially novel
paradigm in which UK5099 promotes a cancer stem
cell phenotype. We also performed Western blotting of
stemness markers Nanog and Oct3/4 in this study. It was
found that cells treated with UK5099 tended to express
higher level of Nanog and Oct3/4. We next analyzed the
chemo-sensitivity to cisplatin and found that cells treated
with UK5099 were more resistant to cisplatin. These
data strongly suggest that the metabolic shift caused by
UK5099 is related to cell stemness upregulation.
In keeping with our results, MPC1 and MPC2 are
reported expressed at a very low level in embryonic stem
cells, and their expression increases upon differentiation
[46, 47]. MPCs (particularly MPC1) were underexpressed
in many cancers and low expression correlates with
poor survival as reported by John C. Schell [25]. When
using the opposite approach, re-expressed MPC in colon
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer cells, it was confirmed with an anti-Warburg effect
in which OXPHOS was enhanced and glycolysis was
decreased. Accompany with this, less stem cell features
were also observed, like defects in soft agar, spheroid,
xenograft growth and lose of stemness markers[25].
If pyruvate transportation into mitochondria is
blocked by UK5099, pyruvate will be forced to convert
to lactate in the cytoplasm. The cellular lactate will be
effluxed out of the cells under conventional condition. It
is known that MPC inhibitor UK5099 may also inhibit
proton-linked plasma membrane monocarboxylate
transporters (MCTs) that carry lactate and pyruvate across
biological membranes. However, we discovered in our
study that after UK5099 application, the extracellular
lactate production was significantly increased while
the intracellular lactate production was not influenced.
Theoretically, the inhibition of MTCs by UK5099 may
influence the efflux of lactate, so that extracellular lactate
after application of UK5099 may not increase. This may
be explained by the finding that UK5099 is approximately
300-fold more potent at inhibiting the MPC compared to
the monocarboxylate transporters as reviewed by Gray
et al in 2014 [48], so that the lactate efflux influence of
UK5099 used in our study is negligible, at least in these
LnCap cells.
In conclusion, we show here that impaired import
of pyruvate via blocking MPC by UK5099 resulted in
mitochondrial OXPHOS dysfunction and enhanced
aerobic glycolysis concomitant with upregulated cell
stemness features such as increased proportion of SP cells,
higher levels of stem cell markers and highly resistant to
chemotherapeutic reagent cisplatin. We propose that MPC
blocker (UK5099) application may be an ideal model for
Warburg effect studies in prostatic cancer cells, since it
attenuates mitochondrial OXPHOS and increases aerobic
glycolysis, and most likely this metabolic shift confers
enhanced stemness phenotype and increased survivability
of prostatic cancer cells. Therefore, targeting this axis may
offer a novel opportunity for selective anti-cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and culture conditions
Prostatic cancer cell line LnCap was obtained
from ATCC (American Type culture collection, USA)
and maintained in our laboratory for the study. The cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco-BRL)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco),
100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin
at 37°C, and 5% CO2. UK5099 (PZ0160, Sigma,
St. Louis. MO, USA), a chemical that was known as MPC
blocker, was added to a final concentration of 10 μM to
reduce pyruvate transportation into mitochondrial. This
concentration of 10 μM was achieved after performing
proliferation assay, pyruvate assay and lactic acid assay
37765

Oncotarget

with different concentrations of UK5099 ranging from
10 μM to 100 μM. It was noticed that LnCap cells grew
more slowly when exposed to higher concentrations
(50, 100 μM) UK5099, while the pyruvate mitochondrial
concentrations and lactic acid levels remained at almost
the same level. Therefore, 10 μM UK5099 was regarded as
an appropriate concentration for subsequent experiments
in this study.

10μl of single cell suspension was mixed well with 10μl
of 0.4% trypan blue dye. 10μl of the mixture was loaded
onto a cell counting chamber (Life Technologies) and
the chamber was applied into Countess® Automated Cell
Counter for cell counting.

Cell cycle analysis
For analysis of cell cycle phase distribution, cells
were fixed in 70% ethanol, treated with RNase A and
stained with DAPI. DNA contents (50,000 cells per
sample) were measured with an LSRII flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).

Measurement of mitochondrial pyruvate
concentration
Cells were seeded evenly into three 10 cm culture
plates at a density of 5 × 106 cells/plate and cultured
for 12 hours. Cells were harvested when grew at 75%
confluent, and mitochondria were isolated by performing
the first part of mitochondrial DNA isolation kit steps
(Biovision K280-50, SFO, USA). 50μL lysis buffer was
added to the isolated mitochondria and homogenized by
sonication. Pyruvate concentration was determined by
pyruvate assay kit (BioAssay Enzychrom EPYR-100,
CA, USA) according to the instructions. Briefly, 90μl
working reagent (including enzyme mix and dye reagent)
was added to each 10μl of sample or standard before. Tap
plate to mix and incubated 30 min at room temperature.
The color intensity of the reaction product at 570 nm is
directly proportional to pyruvate concentration. Pyruvate
concentrations of samples were calculated based on OD
values of standards.

OCR measurement using seahorse
Xf24-extracellular flux analyzer
Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured
using a Seahorse XF24 extracellular flux analyzer
(Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA, USA).
Briefly, cells were plated at 5*104Cells/well in a XF24
cell culture microplate (Seahorse Bioscience) and
cultured for 6 hours for cells to attach to the bottom.
The cells were switched into unbuffered DMEM
supplemented with 2 mM sodium pyruvate and 20 mM
carnosine 1 h prior to the beginning of the assay and
maintained at 37°C. OCR was reported in the unit of
picomoles per minute. After baseline measurements,
OCR was measured by sequentially adding to each
well carbonylcyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone
(FCCP) and rotenone, to reach working concentrations of
0.4 μM and 1 μM, respectively.

Lactate assay
1*106 cells were seeded into 6 cm culture dishes and
cultured for 24 hours. The culture medium was centrifuged
and ready to go lactate assay. Those cells were harvested
in 200μl PBS to achieve cell lysate by sonication (in icewater bath) before being centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10
min. The clear supernatant was applied for lactate assay.
The lactate assay was performed using an Enzy­
Chrome lactate assay kit (BioAssay, ECLC-100, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 80
ul working reagents (including lactate dehydrogenase
which catalyzed oxidation of lactate, NADH formed in
this reaction reduces a formazan reagent) were added to
each standards or samples. The intensity of the product
color, measured at 565 nm, is proportionate to the lactate
concentration. The sample L-lactate concentrations were
determined based on OD values of samples and standards.
Experiments were conducted in triplicate.

Determination of ATP production
1*106 cultured cells were harvested in 200μl PBS
and cell lysate was achieved by sonication (in icewater bath) before the homogenate was centrifugated
at 12,000 g for 10 min. Finally, in 96-well plates,
10 μl of the supernatant was mixed well with 100 μl of
luciferase reagent, which catalyzed the light production
from ATP and luciferin ATPliteTM Luminescence
Assay kit (PerkinElmer) according the manufacturer’s
instructions. Luminescence was measured by lumi­
nometer (Fluroskan Ascent FL, Thermo). Standard
curve was also generated and the amount of ATP in the
experiments samples was calculated. Total ATP levels
were expressed as nmol/106 cell.

Determination of ROS production

Cell growth assay and cell count

Total ROS production was investigated using
dichlordehydrofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA; Molecular
Probes). Briefly, cells in approximate 60% confluence were
washed with PBS and stained with 10 μM DCFH-DA in
FluoroBrite™ DMEM medium (contains 10% FBS and
pre-warmed to 37°C) for 20 min in CO2 incubator at 37°C

Cells were seeded at a density of 2500 cells/well in
6-well plates (NUNC™, Thermo Scientific, Denmark).
The cells in different wells were harvested every
24 hours using 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) and counted by
Countess® Automated Cell Counter (Life Technologies).

000 cells per sample) were analyzed with a flowcytometer
FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The signal
was excited with 488 nm laser and detected with band pass
filter set 530/30. Unstained samples of each group were
prepared to measure background fluorescent signal. Cells
treated with 250 μM hydrogen peroxide were performed as
positive controls.
The ROS production was also verified using a
fluorescence microplate reader. The cells were incubated
with 10 μM DCFH-DA at 37°Cfor 20 min. After the
incubation the cells were washed and re-suspended
in PBS. 1*106 cells per sample were added in 96well microplate (E&K Scientific, EK-25075) and the
fluorescence was measured with an excitation wavelength
of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 532 nm using
a fluorescence microplate reader (μQuant; Bio-Tek
Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA).

added to each flask. After 72 h, Cells were brought into
suspension using trypsin and counted in triplicate samples.
Cell viability was calculated based on the survival of nontreated cells. The experiments were conducted in triplicate.

Western blotting assay
Briefly, 50 μg of cellular proteins were loaded onto
a 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins
were transferred to PVDF membranes (BIO-RAD, USA).
Membranes were blocked in 5% milk, washed with PBST
(PBS with 0.1% Tween), and incubated with the indicated
antibodies. After washing and incubation with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody
at 1:1000 in 5% milk, the membranes were washed, and
bound horseradish peroxidase was detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare,UK) and exposed to
X-ray film. The optimized antibodies used in this study
included: Oct3/4 (1 μg/ml, MAB1759, R&D), Nanog
(1 μg/ml, AF1997, R&D), Tubulin (1:5000, 103M4773,
Sigma).

Measurement of mitochondrial membrane
potential (ΔΨm)

Statistical analysis

ΔΨm was measured with a unique cationic dye
of 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro 1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazo­
lcarbocyaenina iodide (JC-1). The normally green fluo­
rescent dye forms red fluorescent aggregates when
concentrated in energized mitochondria in response to their
higher membrane potential. Briefly, cells were stained with
JC-1 (1 μM) at 37°C for 30 min. After incubation the cells
were washed twice and resuspended in PBS before analyzed
(30,000 cells per sample) with a flow cytometer (FACScan,
Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For each cell the average
intensity of green and red fluorescence was determined, and
the ratio of JC-1 aggregate (red) to monomer (green) was
calculated. A decrease in this ratio was thus interpreted as a
decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential[23].

All data represented at least three independent
experiments and statistical analyses were performed using
Graphpad Prism 5. Data were analyzed by the one-way
ANOVA test and student’s t test (p < 0.05 was considered
statistical significant).

Flow cytometry analysis for Hoechst efflux (side
population assay)

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

1*106 cells per sample were prepared and stained
with 5 μg/mL of Hoechst 33342 (stock solution of 1 mg/
ml; Sigma) in 2 mL PBS containing 2% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) at 37°Cfor 120 min. After incubation, the
cells were washed and resuspended in PBS. In addition,
2 μg/mL of propidium iodide (PI) was added for dead cell
discrimination. For each sample, 30,000 cells were analyzed
for hoechst efflux examination using the same FACScan
flowcytometer as described above., Verapamil (50 μM;
Sigma) was used to block Hoechst efflux and determine the
area of the side population in a separate sample.

No conflict of interest was declared by the authors.
