ABSTRACT
In multiple myeloma, elevated MYC expression is related to disease initiation
and progression. We found that in myeloma cell lines, MYC gene amplifications were
common and correlated with MYC mRNA and protein. In primary cell samples MYC
mRNA levels were also relatively high; however gene copy number alterations were
uncommon. Elevated levels of MYC in primary myeloma cells have been reported
to arise from complex genetic aberrations and are more common than previously
thought. Thus, elevated MYC expression is achieved differently in myeloma cell lines
and primary cells. Sensitivity of myeloma cell lines to the MYC inhibitor 10058-F4
correlated with MYC expression, supporting that the activity of 10058-F4 was through
specific inhibition of MYC.

MYC activity has been shown to be associated with many
features of cancer cells including cell metabolism and
proliferation. [7] In multiple myeloma it was commonly
thought that activation of MYC was a late-stage event. [8]
The importance of MYC in myeloma disease progression
has lately become clearer, and increased MYC activity
has been implicated in progression from MGUS to fullblown myeloma. [9–12] Recently, two papers showed
that complex rearrangements positioning MYC in the
proximity of super-enhancers caused elevated MYC
expression in primary myeloma cells. [13, 14] Moreover,
MYC was shown to be the most frequent translocation
partner in aberrations involving the immunoglobulin light
chains. [15] Altogether, MYC rearrangements were found
in nearly half of the myeloma patients leaving MYC the
most commonly mutated gene in multiple myeloma. [13]
We have earlier shown that MYC expression
was important for in vitro survival of myeloma cells
using different approaches for targeting MYC. [16–18]
The question we wanted to address in this study was
whether the vulnerability of multiple myeloma cells

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma is the second most common
hematological malignancy and accounts for about 2% of
cancer-related deaths. The cancer cells arise from postgerminal center plasma cells and usually reside in the
bone marrow. Myeloma is preceded by a benign condition
termed monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance (MGUS), [1] and the annual risk of
progression to myeloma is about 1%. [2] Treatment of
multiple myeloma has improved during the last decades
by the introduction of proteasome inhibitors such as
bortezomib and carfilzomib as well as immunomodulatory
drugs (IMIDs) such as thalidomide and lenalidomide.
However; the median overall survival time from diagnosis
is still no more than 5–7 years. [3, 4]
The transcription factor c-MYC (hereafter termed
MYC) and the related N-MYC and L-MYC oncogenes
are involved in the development of up to 70% of all
cancers. [5] Under normal conditions MYC increases
cell proliferation and halts differentiation. [6] Abnormal

for MYC inhibition correlated to cellular levels of
MYC. Pharmacological targeting of MYC activity has
been challenging. One option is to use small molecule
inhibitors that target MYC-MAX heterodimerization
thereby preventing transactivation of MYC target genes.
[19, 20] We found that the small molecule inhibitor of
MYC, 10058-F4, suppressed proliferation and survival
of myeloma cells, arguing for a distinct role of MYC in
multiple myeloma. The importance of MYC was further
supported by an inverse correlation between IC50 of the
inhibitor and the level of MYC in myeloma cell lines.

indicate that the main determinant of elevated MYC
expression in myeloma cell lines is amplification of the
MYC gene.
We went on to investigate the variation in MYC
gene copy numbers in myeloma patient samples by the
same method as applied for cell lines. Interestingly, most
of the primary samples (n = 21) had two copies of the
MYC gene and the samples deviating from this (n = 7)
had MYC gene copies varying from 1 to 4 (data not
shown). The levels of MYC mRNA, on the other hand,
showed remarkable variation (Figure 3A). Thus, in
contrast to myeloma cell lines, MYC levels in primary
cells apparently are not determined by the number of gene
copies as measured here, but by other mechanisms.
Interestingly, we originally compared MYC mRNA
levels in cell lines and primary cells applying GAPDH
mRNA as the only reference, getting higher MYC levels in
primary cells than in myeloma cell lines. However, when
comparing GAPDH mRNA levels in cell lines with primary
cells using the Nanostring nCounter technology and using
several genes as reference; it turned out that the difference
in GAPDH mRNA was even greater than the difference in
MYC mRNA. Thus, when comparing MYC mRNA levels
in primary cells and cell lines, the patient cells as a group
had lower MYC expression levels than cell lines (Figure 3B).
Patients (n = 28) had a median MYC level of 2345, range
660–15969, whereas the cell lines (N = 11) had a median
level of 8411, range 85–18859. Furthermore, the cell lines
had a median GAPDH level of 33347, range 23653–59757,
whereas the primary cells had a median GAPDH level of
8345, range 2297–15769 (Figure 3C). We also treated the
primary myeloma samples with the MYC inhibitor to obtain
IC50 values. However, the cell viability varied and only 18
out of 28 samples had a viability > 50% without treatment.
Those samples were included in analysis (data not shown).
When comparing IC50 values for 10058-F4 in the samples
with baseline viability > 50% with MYC mRNA expression,
we were not able to see the same correlation as in cell lines.
However, analysis of only 18 samples may not be sufficient
to see such correlations. There was no correlation between
cell viability in the patient samples and 10058-F4 IC50
values (n = 28, data not shown).
The primary cells studied were both from newly
diagnosed, untreated patients (n = 13), as well as from
treated patients (n = 15), i.e. patients at a later stage of
disease. Clinical characteristics of the patient samples
are found in Supplementary Table I. Interestingly,
the MYC mRNA levels were not different between
previously treated and untreated patients (Figure 3D),
indicating that untreated patients had myeloma cells with
as high MYC expression as patients in later stages of
disease. These observations suggest that both untreated
and treated patients may have plasma cells with high
MYC expression that possibly could be targeted by
MYC inhibition.

RESULTS
We have earlier shown that the small molecule
MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 induces apoptosis in myeloma
cell lines and primary cells. [17, 20] The inhibitor
downregulated MYC protein and mRNA in a dosedependent manner in myeloma cells (Supplemenatry
Figure 1A–1C). We wanted to find out if the baseline
MYC expression could determine myeloma cell
sensitivity to 10058-F4. A panel (n = 11) of myeloma cell
lines were treated with increasing amounts of inhibitor
for three days. The combined effects on cell proliferation
and viability were determined using CellTiter Glo which
measures the ATP content in cells (Supplementary
Figure  2). IC50 values were determined from doseresponse curves and related to MYC transcript numbers
measured by the nCounter Nanostring technology
(Figure  1A, Supplementary Figure  3A) and protein
levels using immunoblotting (Figure 1B, Supplementary
Figure  3B,  3C). There was a negative correlation
between IC50 values and mRNA (R2 = 0, 548) or protein
(R2 =  0,  585) levels. Taken together, the correlation
between MYC expression and sensitivity to the 10058F4 compound, supports that 10058-F4 is a relatively
specific inhibitor of MYC activity. Secondly, the finding
that the cell lines with the highest MYC concentration
were the most sensitive suggests that cell lines expressing
high levels of MYC are more dependent on the MYC
expression for proliferation or survival than cell lines
expressing lower amounts of MYC.
Next, we measured MYC gene copy numbers
in all 11 myeloma cell lines using PCR with primers
for exon 3 (Supplementary Figure 3D) and correlated
the copy numbers with MYC mRNA, as well as with
protein levels (Supplementary Figure 3A, 3B and 3C).
In cell lines, the MYC gene copy numbers varied from
two to nine. The measured copy numbers were almost
identical using primers that were specific for exon 1
and exon 2 (Supplementary Figure 3D), indicating the
presence of the whole gene rather than fragments of
the gene. Interestingly, the MYC gene copy numbers
correlated well with both mRNA (R2 = 0.847) and protein
(R2 = 0.607) levels (Figure 2A and 2B). The results thus

DISCUSSION

A major concern when applying small molecule
inhibitors is the specificity of the inhibitor. The 10058-F4
drug has been proposed to be a specific inhibitor of MYCMAX heterodimerization at concentrations < 100  μM.
[20, 21] However, even if 10058-F4 clearly inhibits the
MYC-MAX interaction, the compound may also affect
other molecules within a cell. The correlation between
MYC expression and sensitivity for the 10058-F4 drug
found in cell lines indicated that the activity of the drug
was specifically directed towards MYC activity. As MYC
is a factor that is functionally non-redundant it may be
particularly attractive as a therapeutic target. [22] MYC
could already indirectly be targeted in the clinic since
many drugs, such as dexamethasone and lenalidomide,
have been shown to kill myeloma cells concomitantly with
partial suppression of MYC, [23, 24] albeit, these drugs
clearly also have other effects.
We found higher MYC mRNA levels in myeloma
cell lines than in primary cells; although the range was
approximately the same in these two groups. Nevertheless,
gene copy number variations in MYC were only common
in cell lines, indicating that primary cells had other
ways of increasing MYC levels than cell lines. Indeed,
recent publications indicate that different rearrangements
involving MYC cause elevated MYC expression in nearly
half of newly diagnosed patients. [13–15] MYC expression
has been reported to affect cell proliferation and energy
metabolism in rapidly proliferating cancer cells. [7]
Amplification of the MYC gene seen in myeloma cell
lines may be a consequence of the selection pressure for
proliferation and survival in tissue culture flasks. Cell lines

The most important data presented here is that
there was a positive correlation between MYC expression
and sensitivity to the MYC activity inhibitor, 10058-F4,
in myeloma cell lines. That finding supports that MYC
is important for myeloma cell survival and that the
inhibitor specifically targets MYC. Secondly, although
both myeloma cell lines and primary cells expressed high
amounts of MYC, there are differences in the underlying
mechanisms behind the expression. And thirdly, MYC
expression was in the same range in plasma cells from
untreated compared to treated patients indicating that
MYC activation is an early oncogenic event in multiple
myeloma.
Cell lines expressing the highest levels of MYC
were the most sensitive to MYC-inhibition, indicating that
these cells were more dependent on MYC for survival and
proliferation than low-expressors. Thus, we hypothesize
that patients with myeloma cells expressing high levels
of MYC could benefit from MYC inhibition. MYC
protein and mRNA are very unstable and may be rapidly
degraded. When isolating primary myeloma cells from
bone marrow samples the procedure usually takes a few
hours and there is a risk that MYC protein and mRNA
levels are not maintained at the same levels as when the
cells are situated in the bone marrow. Thus, the most
reliable way to measure MYC levels in patients could be
by quantitative in situ immunohistochemistry using bone
marrow biopsies. Unfortunately, it was not possible for us
to perform such experiments in this study.

are highly proliferating, whereas primary myeloma cells in
the bone marrow in general proliferate very slowly, with a
Ki-67 labelling index less than 5% for most patients. [25]
Amplification of the MYC gene may be a simple way of
achieving high MYC levels in cell lines that over years
have been selected for cell proliferation in vitro. Another
difference is that, unlike myeloma cell lines, primary
cells depend on the bone marrow microenvironment and
are unable to survive in tissue culture. There was also a
difference in GAPDH expression levels between cell
lines and primary cells that could reflect differences in
utilization of glycolysis for ATP production.
In patients, a negative relationship between MYC
expression and progression-free and overall survival has
been described, suggesting an important role for MYC in
the regulation of tumor mass. [14, 26–28] We compared
the MYC mRNA expression with clinical information
on progression-free and overall survival in our patient
samples, but could not find any relationship (data not
shown). However, the number of informative patients
was too low to draw any conclusions. Nevertheless, our
findings that MYC mRNA is as high in untreated patients
as in patients at later stages of disease suggest that MYC
may be important during the whole course of disease.
To summarize, our results suggest that many
myeloma patients, but first of all patients with cells
expressing high MYC levels, might benefit from MYC
inhibition. If a specific and clinically applicable MYCinhibitor became available, it would be important to
characterize which patients might benefit from inhibition
of MYC.

Primary cells
Primary CD138+ myeloma cells were isolated
from bone marrow specimens included in the Norwegian
Myeloma Biobank using RoboSep automated cell
separator and Human CD138 Positive Selection Kit
(StemCell Technologies, Grenoble, France). The study

Genomic DNA and total RNA were extracted from
frozen cell pellets using AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro Kit and
Qiacube (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and quality
of DNA and RNA was determined using NanoDrop
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA), and samples were stored at −80°C until
further use.

Cell lines and reagents

Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized
from total RNA using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA
kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR was
performed using StepOne Real-Time PCR System and
Taqman Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems).
The comparative Ct method was used to estimate relative
changes in gene expression using MYC Taqman assay
(Hs00153408_m1) and GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1) as
housekeeping gene.

A panel of 11 myeloma cell lines was used. Four

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was estimated using the CellTiterGlo assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), that measures
the cells’ ATP content. The cells were seeded in 100 μL
per well in white opaque 96 well plates and treated with
increasing doses of inhibitor for 72 hours. The cell lines
have different growth rates and, thus, the cell numbers that
were seeded for each cell line varied from 10000 – 50000
per well. Assay reagent was added and the plates were
mixed for 2 min on a shaker. After a 10 min incubation
in room temperature luminescence was detected using
a Victor 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Inc.,
