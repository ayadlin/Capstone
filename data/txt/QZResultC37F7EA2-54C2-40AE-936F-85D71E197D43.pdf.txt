Abstract
Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) is a selective, non–ATP-competitive inhibitor of mitogen-activated
protein/extracellular signal–regulated kinase kinase (MEK)-1/2. The range of antitumor activity seen preclinically and in patients highlights the importance of identifying determinants of response to this drug. In large
tumor cell panels of diverse lineage, we show that MEK inhibitor response does not have an absolute correlation with mutational or phospho-protein markers of BRAF/MEK, RAS, or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
activity. We aimed to enhance predictivity by measuring pathway output through coregulated gene networks
displaying differential mRNA expression exclusive to resistant cell subsets and correlated to mutational or
dynamic pathway activity. We discovered an 18-gene signature enabling measurement of MEK functional output independent of tumor genotype. Where the MEK pathway is activated but the cells remain resistant to
selumetinib, we identified a 13-gene signature that implicates the existence of compensatory signaling from
RAS effectors other than PI3K. The ability of these signatures to stratify samples according to functional
activation of MEK and/or selumetinib sensitivity was shown in multiple independent melanoma, colon, breast,
and lung tumor cell lines and in xenograft models. Furthermore, we were able to measure these signatures in
fixed archival melanoma tumor samples using a single RT-qPCR–based test and found intergene correlations
and associations with genetic markers of pathway activity to be preserved. These signatures offer useful tools
for the study of MEK biology and clinical application of MEK inhibitors, and the novel approaches taken may
benefit other targeted therapies. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2264–73. ©2010 AACR.

way (Supplementary Fig. S1) and thus has potential to block cell
proliferation, survival, and/or invasion depending on cell type.
Pathway-activating mutations in BRAF (2) are prevalent in a
number of tumor types (Supplementary Fig. S1) and have been
linked to cell line sensitivity to MEK inhibition (3), raising the
prospect that pharmacologic inhibition of this pathway could
have clinical benefit (4, 5) in selected patients. Mutant Ras
has also been linked to sensitivity to MEK inhibition (1, 5);
however, this link is complex because RAF represents only
one of several Ras effector pathways, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), that may offer a compensatory route to
cell proliferation/survival (refs. 6, 7; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Diagnostics that successfully guide clinical treatment decisions (8) include the measurement of Her2 status for trastuzumab treatment of breast cancer and KRAS mutation for
colorectal cancer resistance to cetuximab (9, 10). Measurement
of individual markers, however, is unlikely to capture the inherent biological complexity of growth factor signaling pathway
dependence (11). Multivariate approaches such as microarrays
have the potential to assess functional activation of the drug
target alongside “compensatory signaling,” yet the dimensionality of microarray data demands large sample numbers to
support robust biomarker discovery (12). The utility of this
technology has been shown for established therapeutics in early

breast cancer, where access to large clinical data sets has led to
the development of Mammaprint and OncotypeDX (9, 13, 14),
which have received approval from the Food and Drug Administration and been included in early clinical guidelines, respectively. For drugs in early development, however, relatively few
patients are treated, forcing a reliance on preclinical models
such as tumor cell lines for hypothesis generation.
Recent studies have illustrated the potential for gene signatures derived from preclinical platforms to be predictive of
clinical drug response (15–17); however, the genes prioritized
within such signatures can vary widely as a result of small differences in the statistical or experimental approaches taken
(18). As an example, a nonredundant set of all genes in 15
published signatures predictive of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK activity (Supplementary Document S1) comprises >16,000 genes.
Few (<1%) of these genes are consistently represented in
multiple signatures, highlighting the high false-positive rate
and therefore limited potential for cross-predictivity from
any one of these signatures alone. These observations suggest
that a combination of large cell line panels and enhanced
approaches to select biologically and statistically robust gene
sets is essential if a clinically relevant signature is to be
generated preclinically (19).
Using large cell panels of diverse tumor types, we took a novel approach to discover candidate gene expression signatures
predictive of functional output from pathways relating to selumetinib response. Two key signatures were identified. The first
(18 genes) provides a measure of MEK functional output independent of the mutational status of BRAF/RAS, whereas the
second (13 genes) predicts drug resistance in the presence of
active MEK independently of PI3K mutation. The signatures
predict baseline and dynamic pathway activity and sensitivity
to selumetinib in independent cell line panels and xenografts.
Furthermore, these signatures were robustly measurable in
fixed human tumor samples, where correlative expression relationships were preserved between genes within signatures
and between signatures and pathway mutational markers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and cell viability assays. Two data sets from
mixed-tumor (1)7 and melanoma (20) cell line panels were
used to identify biomarkers of selumetinib. Further testing
was run in independent colon (21) and breast (22) cell panels.
Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In vitro GI50 is the concentration of selumetinib required to control cell growth by 50% in a 72-h period,
as determined by the colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay (ref. 1; Supplementary Table S1).
An additional mixed-tumor cell panel (23) was exposed to
PD0325901 or DMSO control for 8 h as previously described
(ref. 24; Supplementary Table S2).
Genetic profiling of cell lines. Genetic screening in the
melanoma (20, 25), breast (22), and drug-treated (23, 24) cell

panels has been described previously. For other cells, genomic DNA was extracted using the Puregene method (Gentra Systems). Primers were designed around each of the
exons of interest to include BRAF (exon 15), KRAS (exons 2
and 3), HRAS (exons 2 and 3), NRAS (exons 2 and 3), and the
entire coding sequences of PTEN, AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3. For
each sample, 25 ng of genomic DNA were amplified with an
MJ tetrad thermal cycler. The PCR products were sequenced
using BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (v3.1, Applied
Biosystems) on a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Cell line genomic amplification/deletion was measured by
comparative genomic hybridization using Agilent 244K
DNA microarrays following the manufacturer's standard protocols8 (z score threshold of 3.0).
Western blot analysis of cell lines. Cells in log-phase
growth were harvested and frozen at −80°C; cell pellets were
lysed from frozen in buffer containing DNase, protease, and
phosphatase inhibitors. Protein was quantified using bicinchoninic acid (Pierce), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Histone H3 displayed minimal variability in expression between cell types
and was selected as a loading control.
Oligonucleotide expression array analysis of cell lines.
For each cell line in the melanoma, mixed-tumor, colon,
and drug-treated panels, 4 μg of total RNA were isolated
(RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen9) and gene expression was measured using Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip arrays
following standard protocol10,11 and as previously described
(20, 23). Affymetrix gene expression was quantified by robust
multiarray analysis, and data collapsed gene centrically
(EntrezID) following probe-set QC (Supplementary Tables
S2 and S3). For the breast cell panel, expression was
measured as the log ratio between individual cell lines and
a breast cell line mixed reference pool using the Agilent
Human 1A V1 chip as previously described (22).
Gene expression data analysis. The approaches taken to
identify and independently test gene expression signatures
are summarized in Fig. 1, with further detail available in
Supplementary Fig. S2.
“Transcriptome networks” predictive of pathway activity
were defined as groups of genes displaying the following
characteristics:
1. Differential expression in a subset of exclusively resistant or sensitive cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3A). For
each gene, a high-expressing and a low-expressing subset of cell lines were identified by k-means clustering
with k = 2 and/or measurement of bimodal/nonnormal
distribution. Genes were prioritized where one of these
subsets was exclusively populated by cell lines of the
same drug sensitivity. Results were compared with

ANOVA, two-dimensional false discovery rate, and regression analysis of log GI50.
2. Networks of intercorrelated expression (ref. 17; Supplementary Fig. S3B). Networks of coexpressed genes
were defined as those displaying a Pearson correlation
approaching that typically observed between redundant probe sets for a given gene. Genes within such
networks were prioritized where gene-gene correlations were reproducible across independent data sets
or supported (with consistent directionality) by published biological interactions [entity relationships
(KEGG12; Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, Ingenuity Systems13), interaction-based co-occurrence in Medline
articles (Linguamatics I2E14 and Quosa15), or colocalization in the genome].
3. Dynamic gene expression reflective of pathway activity.
From literature16 and online databases (GEO17, Oncomine; ref. 26), we were able to identify 109 “transcriptome” signatures reflecting inhibition or activation of
targets in several oncogenic pathways (aDOPT database, Supplementary Document S1). Genes consistently
differentially expressed in multiple signatures for a
common pathway were prioritized.
Potential mRNA markers of selumetinib response were
ranked relative to the quantity, quality, and consistency of
supporting statistical and biological annotation. One hundred eighty-one genes, representing the number expected
to be measurable by RT-qPCR in clinical tissue, were prioritized for further validation. An aggregate measure of the
gene expression from each transcriptome network was calculated by scaling probe-set expression values between 0
(min across all cell panels) and 1 (max), taking the mean
gene centrically and then taking the mean for genes within
a network.
Biomarker measurement in formalin-fixed paraffinembedded melanoma samples. Commercially available
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) melanoma tumor
sections were sourced from Asterand and subjected to histopathologic assessment of tumor content. DNA was extracted
as previously described (27) and BRAF mutation measured
using ARMS (Supplementary Table S4). RNA was isolated using an optimized FFPE RNA system (Ambion), RNA was
quantified (NanoDrop).
RT-qPCR confirmation of gene expression. Expression
profiles were validated in the cell lines and FFPE melanoma
tissue samples by one-step RT-qPCR on 100 ng of total RNA
(Quantitect, Qiagen10) and 100 μL of PCR mix per sample
using ABI 7900HT on customized TaqMan low-density arrays (TLDAs; Applied Biosystems). Gene expression profiling

was done on four arrays (48 format P/N 4346800), each including 45 target genes and 3 normalization genes. The normalization genes were 18S rRNA (manufacturer's mandatory
housekeeping gene), PGK1, and PSMB2. These were selected
from a panel of housekeeping genes as they showed minimal variability in expression across the cell lines and melanoma FFPE samples. Expression data were normalized to
the average ΔCt for PGK1 and PSMB2.

Results
Cell lines and response to MEK inhibition. Cell lines were
classified as sensitive (<1 μmol/L) or resistant (>10 μmol/L)
based on the GI50 distribution profile (Fig. 2) and predictions
for the clinically achievable concentration of drug. This
left a 10-fold “intermediate” window to allow for variability
in the cell profiling data. The cell line sensitivity profile of
selumetinib did not correlate with agents targeting unrelated
pathways, highlighting the determinants of response to be
mechanistic and not prognostic.

Figure 1. Preprocessing and gene expression analysis were done
separately for each of the mixed-tumor and melanoma cell line panels.
Transcriptional signature gene expression was tested against selumetinib
(AZD6244) sensitivity and dynamic pathway activity in multiple
independent data sets. Methods were partially automated using R
(http://www.r-project.org/) and workflow technology (InforSense KDE, http://
www.inforsense.com/). RT-qPCR, reverse transcription quantitative PCR.

Figure 2. A consistent bimodal
distribution of cell lines is seen
relative to selumetinib GI50 in
both the mixed-tumor (A) and
melanoma (B) panels, suggesting
distinct populations of responding
(<1 μmol/L) and resistant
(>10 μmol/L) cell lines. In the
mixed-tumor panel, BRAF and, to a
lesser extent, RAS mutations are
concentrated in sensitive cell lines,
whereas a trend is visible for
mutational activation of the PI3K
pathway (deletion/amplification/
point mutation in PTEN, PI3K, or
AKT) in resistant cell lines.
Responding cell lines and differing
genetic phenotypes are unevenly
distributed across cells of differing
tissues of origin (controlled for
within statistical analyses).

Hypothesis testing of previously identified candidate
markers. Higher frequency of BRAF mutation was seen
in melanoma and colorectal cell lines (Fig. 2), and RAS
mutation was more prominent in colorectal and lung,
agreeing with the clinical distribution represented in the
COSMIC database18 (Supplementary Fig. S1). A significant
relationship between cell line sensitivity to selumetinib
and BRAF or KRAS mutation was seen in the mixed-tumor
panel (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S4). Prediction was
enhanced by combining these two oncogenes (P < 0.0001,
sensitivity = 0.86, specificity = 0.76; Supplementary Fig. S5)
and further still by accounting for resistance measured
through genetic loss of PTEN function or activation of
PI3K/Akt (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S5). No relationship
between sensitivity and BRAF/RAS mutation was observed
in the melanoma panel (Fig. 2B); however, the number of
resistant and wild-type (WT) BRAF cell lines was limited.
Although a trend is visible for elevated phospho-total ERK
protein and reduced phospho-Akt in sensitive cell lines
(Fig. 3), the relationship is not absolute and no significant
prediction of response was achieved from quantified values
(Supplementary Fig. S6).
Generation of novel candidate multivariate markers of
pathway activity and selumetinib response. We hypothesized that genes reflective of activity and functional output
from the drug target, MEK, would have the following characteristics: low expression exclusive to a consistent subset of
resistant cell lines (e.g., Supplementary Fig. S3); reproducibility in independent data sets; and overlap with signatures of

dynamic activity of RAS, RAF, MEK, and/or ERK. Eighteen
correlated genes showed this combined profile and were
termed a “MEK-functional-activation” network/signature
(Fig. 4A and B; Supplementary Fig. S7). Cell lines harboring
MEK pathway–activating mutations typically showed high
baseline expression of genes in this signature (Fig. 4C and
D; Supplementary Fig. S8A).
By extension, we also hypothesized that genes reflective of
core resistance mechanisms would show consistently high
expression in one or more subsets of resistant cell lines.
We identified a 13-gene “compensatory-resistance” network/signature overlapping dynamic signatures of RAS/
MAPK activity, but importantly not RAF/MEK/ERK (Fig. 4A
and B; Supplementary Fig. S7). Expression from this signature did not correlate to RAS or PI3K pathway mutations,
was typically low in cells with BRAF mutation, and was
never seen without expression of MEK-functional-activation
(Fig. 4C and D; Supplementary Fig. S8B). These observations
highlight a potential role in resistance for compensatory signaling through RAS effectors other than RAF-MEK or PI3K
that are attenuated where MEK dependence is highest.
By plotting the aggregate gene expression measurement for
MEK-functional-activation against compensatory-resistance,
we were able to separate drug-sensitive from drug-resistant
cell lines (Fig. 5A). This predictivity was reproducible in both
the melanoma and the mixed-tumor panels irrespective of
tissue of origin, panel, or mutation status, with optimal
sensitivity of 0.96 and specificity of 0.82.
Collectively, these data suggest that where MEK activation
originates upstream of RAF, the preference of signaling from
RAS is the primary determinant of response to selumetinib.
The complexity of resistance, however, is further illustrated

Figure 3. Western blots of lung (A),
colon (mixed-tumor panel; B), and
melanoma (C) cell lines, ordered by
response (GI50) to selumetinib,
suggest a range of pERK and pAkt
expression in both sensitive and
resistant cells. In resistant cell lines,
trends are visible for low pERK
(suggesting inactivity of MEK), or
high pERK alongside high pAkt
(suggesting that dependency on
MEK signaling is reduced through
PI3K activity); however, these
relationships are not absolute.
Scaled mean expressions from
mRNA signatures identified as
predictive of selumetinib response
are also shown, with little correlation
obvious between pERK and
MEK-functional-activation or
between pAkt and
compensatory-resistance.

by the identification of other smaller gene networks associating
alternative mechanisms with resistance (Supplementary Fig.
S9), described in Supplementary Table S5. In total, 181 genes
were prioritized as potential markers of response, 67 of
which displayed consistent expression trends in both the
cross-tumor and melanoma cell panels (Supplementary
Table S5). That the gene selection approaches taken afforded
enhanced reproducibility is perhaps best illustrated by comparison to gene sets identified by filtering on P value from
the t test statistical method that, in contrast to those
described in this article, show little crossover between cell
panels (Supplementary Table S6). The limited representation
of canonical pathway components in our signatures, and the
resulting reliance on literature-derived pathway transcriptome signatures, is also noteworthy (Fig. 4A; Supplementary
Table S7).
Performance of signatures in independent in vitro,
in vivo, and clinical data sets. The power of the
MEK-functional-activation and compensatory-resistance
gene expression signatures to predict selumetinib response
was reproducible at the same threshold in an independent
panel of 46 colorectal cell lines (Fig. 5B), with a sensitivity of
1 and a specificity of 1. Notably, despite the low representation
of breast cell lines in the mixed-tumor panel, a high level
of predictivity was also achieved across a panel of 43 breast
cell lines (ref. 22; Fig. 5C) using an independent gene expression platform, with an optimal sensitivity of 0.78 and a
specificity of 0.96. Consistent trends were also seen for
high MEK-functional-activation expression in cells known
to be enriched for MEK signaling and for low compensatoryresistance where MEK-functional-activation was low (Figs. 5
and 6; Supplementary Fig. S10; refs. 6, 22).
Using data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE3542),
we showed that the MEK-functional-activation signature
was elevated following transfection of activated MEK
into estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer cells (Fig. 6A;

2268

Cancer Res; 70(6) March 15, 2010

ref. 28). In addition, this signature showed consistently
reduced expression in 32 cell lines treated with a different
MEK inhibitor, PD0325901 (Fig. 6B). As expected, cell lines
sensitive to MEK inhibition tended to harbor MEK-activating
mutations in BRAF or RAS and displayed a higher baseline
MEK-functional-activation expression that was dramatically
reduced following MEK inhibition. BRAFV600E lines known
to harbor PI3K pathway–activating mutations also followed
this pattern of MEK-functional-activation expression, but
showed varying sensitivity consistent with trends seen in
other cell panels (Fig. 6B). Lower MEK dependency in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)–driven cell lines was indicated by
low baseline expression from the MEK-functional-activation
signature, predictive of resistance to inhibition and supporting
previously published observations (24). We were also able to
confirm this genotype-specific reduction in MEK-functionalactivation expression following MEK inhibition in tumor
xenograft models (Fig. 6C; ref. 24).
A key objective of this work was to measure these transcriptome networks in clinical tissue. When confirmed
by RT-qPCR, expression of each gene showed a Pearson correlation of >0.6 to Affymetrix data across the mixed-tumor
and melanoma cell panels (e.g., DUSP6; Supplementary
Fig. S11). In 18 FFPE early-stage melanoma patient samples, all genes were detectable in at least 90% of the tissue
samples when measured by the same approach. Wilcoxon
tests showed a statistically significant enrichment (P =
0.033) of higher intergene correlations across tissue samples for genes within the MEK-functional-activation and
compensatory-resistance transcriptome network signatures, confirming that the correlations translate into similar relationships within melanoma tissue. Notably, the
MEK-functional-activation signature showed a higher correlation to BRAF mutation status across the melanoma tissue
samples than the other genes measured, and also low expression was only seen in BRAF WT samples (Fig. 6D).

Transcriptional Signatures of MEK Addiction

Discussion
Exploration of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway has
revealed significant complexity to be considered when
modeling response to MEK inhibitors. Functional activation
of MEK can be driven from RAF, RAS, or RTKs, and resistance
can be mediated by different compensatory mechanisms
including alternative RAS/RTK effectors such as PI3K (Fig.
1A). This level of pathway interplay highlights the challenge
of identifying biomarkers to predict dependence on MEK.
Previous studies have linked BRAF and, more weakly, RAS
mutations to in vitro sensitivity to MEK inhibition (1, 3, 5, 7)

and PI3K pathway–activating mutations to resistance (6, 7).
The results from the present study using selumetinib support this general observation, but reveal these relationships
to be far from absolute when assessed across a larger, more
diverse collection of cell types (Fig. 2). A similar trend was
observed for protein markers of MEK/ERK and PI3K pathway activation, with pERK and pAkt proving to be less robust markers of pathway output than previously suggested
(refs. 5, 7, 24; Fig. 3). It is perhaps not surprising that individual mutation or protein measurements fail to adequately
predict pathway activity considering the complexity of signal control through the MEK/ERK axis. To provide a more

Figure 4. A, genes prioritized in the MEK-functional-activation and compensatory-resistance network signatures are shown. The identification of genes
displaying consistent expression in published pathway transcriptome signatures enhanced biological characterization otherwise achieved through
protein interaction/canonical pathway based information. RAF/MEK/ERK biological overlay is seen exclusively in the MEK-functional-activation
signature, whereas RAS signaling alongside that linked to broader MAPK activity (PTEN/PI3K, TGF/TNF/IL-6/NF-κB and DNA repair; refs. 7, 24, 38, 39) is
concentrated to the compensatory-resistance signature genes. B, unsupervised clustering highlights correlations between genes within transcriptome
network signatures and separates selumetinib (AZD6244) responsive from nonresponsive cell lines. C, taking the mean scaled expression for genes within
signatures highlights the cell line subset–specific nature of expression, with MEK-functional-activation exclusively low in a resistant cell line subset and
high compensatory-resistance limited to a subset of resistant cell lines. D, cell lines harboring BRAF and, to a lesser extent, RAS activating mutations
display high expression of the MEK-functional-activation signature. No obvious correlation is visible between compensatory-resistance signature
expression and RAS and/or PI3K pathway mutations.

Figure 5. Selumetinib sensitive (green) cell lines show higher
MEK-functional-activation and/or lower compensatory-resistance
signature expression. The converse is true of resistant (red) cell lines, and
cells of intermediate sensitivity (gray) lie in between. In no cases is
high compensatory-resistance expression seen without expression of
MEK-functional-activation, suggesting that the mechanisms represented
by these signatures are not mutually exclusive. A, the threshold at
which optimal separation of sensitive from resistant cell lines is achieved
in the mixed-tumor/melanoma cell panels is illustrated with a dotted
line. B, consistent separation at the same threshold is achieved in an
independent panel of colon cell lines, where all BRAF-mutant tumors
show high expression of the MEK-functional-activation signature.
C, signatures also show a consistent trend relative to response in an
independent breast cell panel, where higher MEK-functional-activation
expression is predominantly seen in the basal/mesenchymal subtype
known to show higher activity of MEK (6). As expression in this breast
panel was measured using a different gene expression platform,
threshold values are not directly comparable to those in A and B.

comprehensive molecular assessment of pathway status, we
set out to identify gene expression networks that more accurately predict sensitivity to MEK inhibition. Furthermore,
we used large cell panels to at least partially reflect known
heterogeneity in tumor biology and increase the likelihood
that in vitro signatures can be translated into the clinical
setting.
By incorporating biological assumptions within the statistical approach taken (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S2), we prioritized two gene transcription networks as markers of
functional output from pathways that act cooperatively to
predict response to selumetinib in vitro. This predictivity
was reproducible across independent cell panels of diverse
tumor origin, even when profiled in different laboratories using alternative technology platforms (Fig. 5). The largest of
these networks comprised 18 genes capturing transcriptional
events common to MEK/ERK functional output and has
therefore been termed the MEK-functional-activation signature (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S7a). This signature contains dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSP4/6; refs. 24, 29),
sprouty homologue 2 (SPRY2; refs. 24, 30), and pleckstrin
homology-like domain family A member 1 (PHLDA1; ref. 31),
all of which are known transcriptional targets of MEK/ERK
signaling involved in negative feedback regulation of ERK
and its upstream modulators. Other known transcriptional
targets of MEK/ERK signaling present in the signature are
the Ets variant transcription factors (ETV4, ETV5, and ELF1;
refs. 32, 33), alongside other MEK family members (MAP2K3)
potentially coactivated by signals activating MEK1/2. The signature also suggests the importance of other genes previously
linked to regulation of MAPK signaling, cell cycle, and tumor
prognosis, including tribbles 2 (TRIB2; ref. 34), galectin 3
(LGALS3; ref. 35), and the transcription factors KANK1
(ANKRD15) and leucine zipper (LZ-) TS1 (36, 37).
Whereas BRAF/RAS mutation (Fig. 2) and pERK protein
measurements (Fig. 3) vary across cells that respond to
selumetinib, expression of the MEK-functional-activation
signature is consistently high (Figs. 4–6; Supplementary
Fig. S10). Furthermore, expression of this signature is dynamically increased following MEK activation (28) and decreased
following MEK inhibition in multiple tumor cell lines and
xenografts (ref. 24; Fig. 6A–C). Collectively, these data show
the biologically relevant and robust measurement of MEK
pathway output and inhibition given by this signature, independent of the pathway activation point, highlighting its utility as both a predictor of drug sensitivity and a marker of
pharmacodynamic response. Because the MEK pathway
can be functional in cells that display resistance to MEK
inhibition, this signature may also enable a more rational
selection of preclinical models (and perhaps patients) in
which to test drug combinations (Supplementary Fig. S12),
especially if the nature of the compensatory pathways that
mask MEK dependence can be identified.
The second network identified was reproducibly predictive
of resistance in cells with MEK functional activity across independent cell panels and was termed compensatory-resistance
(Fig. 4A). Biological overlay suggested that this signal may
be the result of a branch in signaling upstream of RAF/MEK,

Transcriptional Signatures of MEK Addiction

Figure 6. A, the MEK-functional-activation signature is significantly upregulated following transfection of activated MEK into the MCF7 cell line (28).
B, furthermore, a knockdown of MEK-functional-activation signature expression is consistently seen following MEK inhibition with PD0325901 across
cell lines (pairs joined with a solid line) independent of tissue of origin (triangle, melanoma; circle, other). Cells responsive to MEK inhibition
(black to gray) show higher MEK-functional-activation expression in the DMSO-treated control and typically harbor mutations in BRAF or NRAS. RTK
(EGFR/ERBB2)-driven cell lines show markedly lower starting MEK-functional-activation expression and are predominantly resistant to MEK inhibition
(white). BRAFV600E PTEN-mutant cells show higher MEK-functional-activation expression but variable sensitivity to MEK inhibition. C, this genotype-specific
pattern of MEK-functional-activation expression is reproducible in BRAF-activated (SKMEL28) and ERBB2-amplified (BT474) tumor xenograft models
following MEK inhibitor treatment (24). D, although expression from the MEK-functional-activation signature seems to be high in most FFPE melanoma
tissue samples, there is a trend for highest expression from patients harboring mutations in BRAF, with lower expression limited to BRAF WT.

with consistent transcriptional regulation by RAS seen for the
majority of these genes (Fig. 4A, Document S1). This hypothesis
was supported as expression of the compensatory-resistance
signature was low in BRAF-mutant cells (Fig. 4; Supplementary
Fig. S9B) and was not seen without MEK activity (Fig. 5). The
signature comprises a diverse set of genes with common linkage
to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/NF-κB signaling (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig.
S7B; refs. 38, 39). A number of these genes are known to regulate
signaling pathways that offer an alternative route to cell proliferation, for example, activation of the G-protein–coupled receptor frizzled homolog 2 (FZD2), which activates WNT signaling
(40), or activation of Jak-STAT by interleukin-6 (IL-6; ref. 41).
Alongside these are a number of genes potentially offering
enhanced cell survival and chemoresistance through control
of tumorigenic processes such as hypoxia/angiogenesis (serine
protease SERPINE1, lysyl oxidase LOX, and collagens COL5A1
and COL12A1), cell cycle [G0/G1switch 2 (GOS2)], proliferation/apoptisis [cysteine-rich transmembrane BMP regulator
1 (CRIM1; ref. 42) and clusterin (CLU; ref. 43)], and immune
evasion (CD274; ref. 44).
The implication that, where MEK is active, Ras effector
signaling through PI3K may mediate resistance to MEK
inhibition is not new (6, 7, 23, 45, 46). Surprisingly, however,
expression of the compensatory-resistance signature seemed
to be independent of PI3K pathway activation (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S8B), contradicting the literature precedent
that PI3K activity alone may be the primary determinant of
resistance (6, 7, 23, 46). Where MEK activity is driven from a
point upstream of RAF, expression from this compensatoryresistance signature potentially enables better separation of
cells with lower MEK dependence.
Having assembled these transcript networks and shown
their in vitro predictive power and ability to recapitulate

known biology, we sought to assess their potential as
biomarkers in the clinical setting. We showed that the
MEK-functional-activation and compensatory-resistance
signatures can be reliably detected in fixed clinical tissue
using a single RT-qPCR–based test and that the internal
correlation structure of these gene networks is preserved.
Furthermore, we showed the expression of the MEKfunctional-activation signature to be higher in BRAFmutant than in WT melanoma (Fig. 6D), indicating that
detectable transcriptional wiring is comparable between
preclinical and clinical samples. From these data, we believe
that it is feasible to use a single test measuring mRNA signatures as an investigative predictive biomarker in clinical
trials for MEK-targeted therapies. A key challenge in this
context will be the translation of gene expression thresholds
set by preclinical data to give clinically relevant patient selection. It is likely that a training step will be necessary to
first optimize the aggregation and application of gene signatures to suit the tissue type being measured (Fig. 6) and the
gene expression platform being used (Fig. 5). Considerations
also need to be taken when designing broader application of
such a test in the clinic, with standardized operating procedures necessary to control for the confounding effects of
variables such as differing protocols, age of samples, and fixation methods (47).
In summary, the methods outlined in this article aim to
improve the biological and clinical relevance of hypotheses
generated from preclinical gene expression data. We identified transcript signatures, robustly detectable using a
single test in fixed clinical tissue, enabling enhanced measurement of baseline/dynamic functional activity from
MEK and prediction of response to selumetinib. These
signatures can identify MEK dependency irrespective of
the genetic or cell-specific factors that determine signaling

preferences, particularly in cells where MEK is only one
output of a more pleiotropic upstream signal (e.g., RAS
mutation). Although we have focused on identifying transcriptome signatures related to response to MEK inhibition, the approach is equally applicable if extended to
other drug targets and signaling pathways, particularly
where genetic markers of response are unknown or insufficient to capture complex signaling.
