Abstract
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), a neuronal kinase that functions in migration, has been found to be
activated in some human cancers in which it has been implicated in promoting metastasis. In this study,
we investigated the role of CDK5 in pancreatic cancers in which metastatic disease is most common at diagnosis. CDK5 was widely active in pancreatic cancer cells. Functional ablation significantly inhibited invasion, migration, and anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and orthotopic tumor formation and systemic
metastases in vivo. CDK5 blockade resulted in the profound inhibition of Ras signaling through its critical
effectors RalA and RalB. Conversely, restoring Ral function rescued the effects of CDK5 inhibition in pancreatic cancer cells. Our findings identify CDK5 as a pharmacologically tractable target to degrade Ras signaling
in pancreatic cancer. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4460–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal human malignancies, with an estimated 34,290 deaths in the United States
in 2008 (1). Despite extensive efforts aimed at developing
improved therapeutic strategies, the dismal 5-year overall
survival rate of ∼4% has not significantly improved over
the last five decades. Therefore, the quest for potent targeted
therapeutic approaches for pancreatic cancer remains an
imperative clinical issue.
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) has ∼60% structural
identity with cyclin-dependent kinases. Nevertheless,
its moniker as a “cyclin-dependent kinase” is somewhat
misleading; CDK5 has no known cell cycle or mitotic function,
and it is not activated by cyclins (2). Instead, CDK5 is activated
by the association with either of the two obligate CDK5Authors' Affiliations: Departments of 1 Pathology, 2 Oncology, and

specific activator proteins, p35 (CDK5R1) or p39 (CDK5R2;
refs. 3, 4). Thus, although CDK5 is ubiquitously expressed,
the restricted expression pattern of the obligate activator proteins confines physiologic CDK5 function to a limited repertoire of tissues, most prominently in cells of neuronal origin;
expression of either p35 or p39 is synonymous with CDK5 kinase activity. Homozygous deletion of the Cdk5 gene in mice
has shed light on the critical functions of CDK5 in brain development (5). Specifically, Cdk5−/− mice die perinatally, with a
remarkable inversion of the six layers of the cerebral cortex,
suggesting a global abnormality of neuronal migration. Misexpression of the CDK5 activator p35 (and more specifically,
its proteolytic COOH-terminal fragment p25) leads to the
dysregulation of CDK5 function and promotes neurofibrillary
tangles and plaque formation, both hallmarks of Alzheimer
disease (6, 7).
Given the numerous parallels between neuronal migration
during embryogenesis and the migration of cancer cells from
their primary site during metastasis (8, 9), a requirement for
CDK5 in the latter phenomenon might be envisioned. Over
the past decade, the compendium of extraneuronal functions
of CDK5 has expanded (10). We previously identified an association between CDK5 and human cancer, with the demonstration that inhibition of CDK5 activity inhibits prostate
cancer metastases in experimental models (11). These
observations were predominantly empirical and the intracellular mechanisms linking CDK5 activity to cancer progression remained essentially unknown. Here, we show that
CDK5 blockade not only inhibited pancreatic cancer migration in vitro and metastases in vivo but also downregulated
anchorage-independent growth and primary tumor engraftment in xenograft models, suggesting a more pervasive
requirement for sustained CDK5 signaling on pancreatic tumorigenesis. We identify a novel Ras-CDK5-Ral signaling axis

CDK5 in Pancreatic Cancer

in pancreatic cancer that provides a unique therapeutic opportunity to target mutant Ras in cancer cells through the inhibition of a key downstream effector pathway. Given the central
role of Ral GTPases in tumor initiation and tumor progression
in Ras-driven neoplasia (12, 13), this study establishes CDK5 as
a bona fide therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer, a malignancy with >90% frequency of KRAS2 gene mutations (14–16).

Two-tailed t test and Mann-Whitney U test were performed
using Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) version 5.01. P < 0.05
was regarded to be statistically significant. Bar diagrams
were generated using Prism version 5.01 and show means

Pancreatic cancer cell lines (PK-9, SW1990, Su86.86, BxPC3, MIAPaCa-2, PANC-1, AsPc-1, and CFPAC-1) were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection, whereas the lowpassage cell lines (Pa16C, Pa03C, Pa20C, Pa18C, and Pa04C)
were generated at our institution, as recently described (14).
All cancer cell lines were cultured as previously described
(17). The generation and culture of hTERT-immortalized
human pancreatic nestin-expressing (HPNE) cells has previously been described (18).
RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and quantitative
real-time PCR
RNA extraction from tissue samples or cultured cells was
done as previously described (19).

Soft agar assays were performed as previously described (19).
Western blotting
Western blot analyses were performed as previously
described (11).
Kinase assays

described (11).
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as previously
described (20) with minor modifications.

The CDK5 obligate activator p35 is commonly
expressed in human pancreatic cancer cells
Western blot analysis showed p35 protein expression in all
13 tested pancreatic cancer cell lines as well as in the nonneoplastic human pancreatic hTERT-HPNE cells. Higher expression of p35 was observed in 9 of 13 pancreatic cancer cell
lines, whereas the remaining four cell lines showed similar
basal expression compared with hTERT-HPNE (Fig. 1A). Expression of p35 transcripts was confirmed at the mRNA level
in eight of eight pancreatic cell lines tested (Fig. 1B).
Blockade of endogenous CDK5 function inhibits
pancreatic cancer cell migration and
anchorage-independent growth
To determine the phenotypic effect of CDK5 blockade in
pancreatic cancer, we generated MIAPaCa-2 cells with enforced expression of a dominant-negative CDK5 (dnCDK5)
protein. The dnCDK5 construct is a D144N kinase–dead
mutant that is expressed in a bidirectional vector, pBI-EGFP,
which also expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP; ref. 11). The pBI-EGFP dnCDK5 and pBI-EGFP empty
vectors were stably selected in MIAPaCa-2 cells and two independent clones (“CDK5-dn1” and “CDK5-dn2”) with a high
level of expression were picked (Fig. 2A and B). Blockade of
endogenous CDK5 had little to no effect on cell number over
96 hours, as assessed by the MTT assay (Fig. 2C). In contrast,
there was a profound inhibition of cell migration at 48 and 72
hours, as assessed by an in vitro modified Boyden chamber
assay, in the two dnCDK5 clones (Fig. 2D). Wound healing
assays performed in vector versus dnCDK5-expressing MIAPaCa-2 cells confirmed the inhibitory effects of CDK5 blockade on cell motility (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). Of note,
small interfering RNA–mediated CDK5 knockdown also significantly reduced the migration of BxPC-3 cells (data not
shown). These results were similar to those observed in prostate cancer cells with knockdown of endogenous CDK5 function (11). Remarkably, we additionally observed a dramatic
inhibition of anchorage-independent growth in the MIAPaCa-CDK5dn clones compared with the vector-only clones
(Fig. 2F). This inhibition of anchorage-independent growth
suggested that CDK5 might play a role in pancreatic tumorigenesis beyond what has been reported in the context of
prostate cancer, in which no significant effects on clonogenicity or tumor formation were observed. Abrogation of CDK5
function by expression of the dnCDK5 allele caused significant changes in cell morphology as shown by immunofluorescence labeling of the cell skeleton (Fig. 2E). Although

Figure 1. Expression of CDK5 and
the CDK5 activator protein, p35,
in pancreatic cancer cells.
A, expression of both CDK5 and
its activator protein p35 was
observed in all 13 cancer cell
lines examined, although in
three of them (SW1990, Su86.86,
and BxPC-3), the expression
levels of p35 were miminal,
comparable with the immortalized
nonmalignant human pancreatic
cell line hTERT-HPNE. B, reverse

vector-transfected cells mostly showed an almost spindle-like
shape with a clearly defined leading edge and microtubuleorganizing centers between the leading edge and nucleus,
MIAPaCa-2 cells stably expressing the CDK5-dn allele were
more round in shape and mostly lacked a clearly defined
leading edge and microtubule-organizing center.
To corroborate these observations in additional pancreatic
cancer models, we used five pancreatic cancer cell lines with
activating KRAS2 mutations (CFPAC1, PANC-1, Pa16C, Pa03C,
and Pa20C), besides MIAPaCa-2 cells. Further, we used a complementary genetic strategy for antagonizing CDK5 function:
RNA interference (RNAi) by enforced expression of a lentiviral
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against CDK5. Stable
CDK5 RNAi was validated by the reduction in endogenous
protein level compared with scrambled shRNA-expressing
cells (Fig. 3A). In vitro modified Boyden chamber assays confirmed that analogous to the dnCDK5-expressing MIAPaCa-2
cells, CDK5 RNAi decreases the migratory abilities of pancreatic cancer cells to a variable extent in five of six of tested
samples (Supplementary Fig. S2; Fig. 3B). Cell viability
(MTS) assays confirmed the absence of any significant reduction in net cell growth upon CDK5 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S3). We then assessed the consequence of CDK5 RNAi
on anchorage-independent growth. Similar to the effects seen
in CDK5-dn MIAPaCa-2 cells, we observed significant inhibition of anchorage-independent growth upon RNAi-mediated
CDK5 knockdown in four of six cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S2B; Fig. 3C). Thus, in the majority of KRAS2-mutant
pancreatic cancer cell lines, loss of CDK5 function was associated with no significant effects on cell viability, while inhibiting cell migration as well as anchorage-independent growth.
In parental MIAPaCa-2 cells, immunoprecipitation-kinase
assays confirmed significant CDK5 enzymatic activity in
pancreatic cancer cells and this activity could be blocked
by exposure to the CDK inhibitor roscovitine (Supplementary Fig. S4A) or by expression of a CDK5dn allele

4462

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

(Supplementary Fig. S4B). Consistent with the effects observed with the genetic inhibition of CDK5 function, roscovitine treatment decreased the number of migrating cells in
an in vitro Boyden chamber assay (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Inhibition of CDK5 function inhibits tumor growth and
metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft model of
human pancreatic cancer
Having established a role for sustained CDK5 activity
on cell motility and anchorage-independent growth of pancreatic cancer cells, we next examined the effects of CDK5
inhibition in an in vivo orthotopic xenograft model. Twoindependent MIAPaCa-2 clones expressing a dominantnegative allele of CDK5 (“dn1” and “dn2”) were used for these
studies and four mice were injected per group. At 6 weeks
postinjection, the mice were euthanized and a comprehensive necropsy was performed for assessment of primary
and metastatic tumor load. The orthotopic primary xenografts established from both independent dnCDK5 clones were
significantly smaller compared with the vector-transfected
MIAPaCa-2 xenografts (Fig. 4A and B). Other than a reduction
in overall viable cell density, there were no histologic differences in the tumor microarchitecture between xenografts
from vector- versus CDK5-dn–transfected MIAPaCa-2 cells
(Fig. 4C). Further, necropsy confirmed a significant reduction
in the frequency of metastases to regional lymph nodes,
spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, or intestine in sets of mice harboring dnCDK5 clones, compared with vector-transfected
MIAPaCa-2 xenografts [Supplementary Fig. S5D; Fig. 4D; 8 of
48 (17%) versus 11 of 24 (46%) affected organ sites; P = 0.008].
Ascites was observed in 4 of 4 (100%) of mice in the control
group, but only in 2 of 8 (25%) of mice carrying dnCDK5 xenografts (not significant; P = 0.061). Similar results were obtained
when shRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK5 in Pa20C
cells was used as a complementary orthotopic xenograft
model system (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Fig. S6).

the pBI-EGFP vector (either empty or expressing D144N dnCDK5) were confirmed by (A) EGFP expression and (B) Western blot analysis for CDK5 levels in
MIAPaCa-2 cells. C, inhibition of CDK5 activity had no effect on MIAPaCa-2 cell growth on plastic, as assessed by MTS assay in empty versus the
two dnCDK5-expressing clones (CDK5-dn1 and CDK5-dn2). D, in contrast, modified Boyden chamber assays showed marked reduction of in vitro
migration in both dnCDK5 clones compared with vector-transfected cells at 48 and 72 h, respectively. E, immunofluorescence staining showed striking
differences in cell morphology in the dnCDK5 versus vector-transfected MIAPaCa-2 cells. Although vector-transfected cells exhibit clear polarity
with microtubule-organizing centers (MTOC; arrows) between the nucleus and leading edge of the cell, dnCDK5-expressing MIAPaCa-2 cells lack
polarity and exhibit a rounded cell shape. F, colony formation in soft agar was also significantly reduced in both dnCDK5 clones compared with

Figure 3. Knockdown of CDK5 expression by RNA-mediated interference in KRAS2 mutant pancreatic cancer cells blocks migration and inhibits
anchorage-independent growth. A, Western blot analysis confirmed successful knockdown of CDK5 expression in CFPAC-1, PANC-1, MIAPaCa-2, Pa03C,
Pa16C, and Pa20C cells transfected with lentiviral CDK5-shRNA (c) compared with lentiviral vector-transfected cells (v). B, modified Boyden chamber
assays confirmed variable decrease of in vitro migration upon CDK5 downregulation, with the most pronounced effects observed in CFPAC-1 and
MIAPaCa-2 cells. C, CDK5 RNAi also significantly inhibited colony formation in soft agar in all four KRAS2 mutant cell lines. Columns, mean of the
respective colony counts; bars, SEM; *, P < 0.05 compared with empty vector–transfected controls.

Thus, consistent with the phenotypes observed in vitro, loss of
CDK5 function in pancreatic cancer cells is associated
with significantly decreased tumorigenicity and systemic
metastases in vivo.
CDK5 blockade inhibits the Ral effector pathway
central to oncogenic Ras signaling
These data showed that in pancreatic cancer, loss of CDK5
function interferes with the malignant phenotype, affecting
both tumor formation (anchorage-independent growth
in vitro and orthotopic engraftment in vivo) and tumor
progression (cell migration in vitro and systemic metastases
in vivo). It was important to begin to identify the signal trans-

duction pathways underlying this reduced tumorigenicity.
Previously, Counter and colleagues (12, 13) have shown the
critical and divergent roles of the Ral effector pathway in oncogenic Ras–induced neoplasia, using pancreatic cancer as a
prototype. Specifically, these investigators showed that the
loss of RalA function can inhibit tumorigenicity across a spectrum of KRAS2-mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines, whereas
sustained RalB activity seemed to be a critical determinant
of tumor progression and metastasis. Those studies showed
that the Ral pathway is a central effector of Ras-mediated
malignant properties in pancreatic cancer. Therefore, we
explored whether CDK5 function might be important for the
activity of the Ras-Ral effector pathway axis in pancreatic

cancer, as a basis for the observed phenotypes in our model
system. Indeed, we found that the activated forms of both
Ral proteins, RalA-GTP and RalB-GTP, were profoundly
reduced in the dnCDK5-expressing MIAPaCa-2 clones, across
multiple independent experiments (Fig. 5A). Rho-GTP and
Rac-GTP levels were also found to be decreased in the
CDK5-dn clones. Similarly, striking downregulation of the
activated Ral-GTP moieties was seen upon the RNAi knockdown of CDK5 in five of the six tested KRAS2-mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines (Fig. 5B). Of note, Pa03C, which showed
neither loss of anchorage-independent growth nor decrease in
migration, retained activation of both Ral proteins, underscoring the importance of this effector pathway in the observed
phenotype(s). We also examined the effects of roscovitine on
Ral-GTP levels, and marked reduction of activated RalA-GTP
was observed in all three examined KRAS2-mutant lines (MIA-

PaCa-2, CFPAC-1, and Panc-1), whereas RalB-GTP was downregulated in all but MIAPaCa-2 cells (Fig. 5C). Thus, these
experiments confirmed that in the majority of pancreatic cancer cells with constitutively activated Ras signaling, CDK5 inhibition can block the activation of a critical effector pathway
implicated in tumor initiation and progression.
To further corroborate that downregulation of Ral signaling is indeed an underlying cause of the phenotypic changes
in pancreatic cancer cells observed upon inhibition of endogenous CDK5 function, we attempted to rescue the malignant
phenotype by constitutively activating RalA and RalB in pancreatic cancer cells expressing dnCDK5. Therefore, we generated dnCDK5 MIAPaca-2 clones with enforced expression of
a constitutively active form (Rlf-CAAX) of the Ral guanine
exchange factor (RalGEF), Rgl2 (25). This RalGEF can activate
RalA and RalB, independent of signaling from oncogenic Ras.

blockade of CDK5 function is

of the active GTP–bound protein in
five of six cell lines, with Pa03C

cell lines treated with roscovitine
in vitro for 30 min compared with
DMSO-treated cells shows the
reduction of GTP-bound RalA in
all three cell lines and the reduction
of GTP-bound RalB in two of
three cell lines.

Rlf-CAAX expression restored RalA-GTP and RalB-GTP levels
in multiple independent dnCDK5 MIAPaCa-2 clones (Fig. 6A)
and significantly “rescued” the phenotype of anchorageindependent growth, compared with vector-transfected
dnCDK5 clones (Fig. 6B and C). Of note, in vivo tumorigenicity
was also partially rescued, as shown using subcutaneous xenografts. Although vector-transfected CDK5dn-expressing
MIAPaCa-2 cells (“MIAPaCa-2-CDK5dn1-control”) formed
xenografts in only 2 of 7 (29%) mice, MIAPaCa-2-CDK5dn1Rgl2-CAAX cells formed xenografts in 7 of 7 (100%) mice
(Fig. 6). Thus, our results place CDK5 as an essential signaling
intermediate in the Ral effector pathway, downstream of
oncogenic Ras. The precise mechanism by which CDK5
modulates Ral activation remains a matter of investigation;
nonetheless, this result indicates that CDK5 inhibition blocks
the malignant properties of pancreatic cancer cells by disrupting an obligate Ras-CDK5-Ral signaling axis.
Blockade of Ral effector function through CDK5
inhibition cooperates with inhibition of
RAF/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt
pathways in limiting pancreatic cancer growth
Although the Ral signaling pathway is critical for Ras-driven
human tumorigenesis, other Ras effector pathways, including
the RAF/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK and phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, also are important in human
cancer (Supplementary Fig. S7A; ref. 26). In pancreatic cancer
cells, it has been shown that inhibitors of the Ras effector

4466

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

pathways RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt could induce G0-G1
cell cycle arrest and, in some instances, apoptosis (27, 28).
Therefore, we reasoned that inhibition of the Ral pathway,
through the blockage of CDK5 activity, in combination with
inhibition of either the RAF/MEK/ERK or PI3K/Akt pathway,
might result in a more pronounced effect on the transformed
properties of Ras-driven pancreatic cancer cells. To test this
possibility, we compared the effect of the MEK inhibitor
U0126 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 in MIAPaCa-2
cells containing the previously described dnCDK5 for inhibition of CDK5, or vector-only control cells. The combination of either small-molecule antagonist at 10 μmol/L
concentration with CDK5 inhibition resulted in marked decrease in anchorage-independent growth compared with
blockade of any one Ras effector pathway alone. This effect was even more accentuated when all three major
downstream effectors of Ras were inhibited simultaneously, with essentially no visible colony formation in soft agar
(Supplementary Fig. S7B and C). Similar results were obtained when the Raf inhibitor sorafenib was used instead
of U0126 to block signaling through the RAF/MEK/ERK
axis (Supplementary Fig. S8). Thus, Ral inhibition mediated
by CDK5 blockage seems to cooperate with blockade of
other Ras effector pathways, further reiterating its potential as a bona fide therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.

Discussion
In the current study, we show that inhibition of CDK5
results in the suppression of cancer growth and metastatic

progression in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. It is
noteworthy that the levels of p35 in pancreatic cancer are not
uniformly higher than those in nonneoplastic pancreatic epithelial cells. In addition, enforced overexpression of p35
above the observed endogenous levels in MIAPaCa-2 cells
led to slightly increased in vitro cell migration but did not
further enhance colony formation in soft agar of xenograft
growth in athymic mice (data not shown). This suggests that
the relative level of CDK5 activity, over some threshold, may
not further increase tumorigenicity and that CDK5 activity
is necessary, although not sufficient, for pancreatic tumor
growth and progression.
These results have significant therapeutic implications for
this almost uniformly lethal disease. The potential for therapeutic application is especially relevant to pancreatic cancer
because our data indicate that CDK5 signaling is critical for
Ras signaling through the Ral pathway, which has emerged as
an important determinant of the malignant phenotype in
pancreatic cancer cells (12, 13). The Ras pathway is activated

by KRAS2 gene mutations in >90% of cases of pancreatic cancer (14) and KRAS2 mutations are among the earliest genetic
aberrations observed in low-grade PanIN lesions during the
multistep progression model leading to fully invasive pancreatic cancer (29). The striking frequency and early onset of
this mutation strongly indicate that Ras signaling is central
to the malignant phenotype in pancreatic cancer and identify
Ras as a prime therapeutic target in this disease. Indeed, in
preclinical studies, disruption of KRAS2 function through
RNAi, antisense DNA, or expression of dominant-negative
KRASN17 attenuates the tumorigenicity of PDAC cell lines
(30–32). Unfortunately, strategies to inhibit the Ras pathway
directly in patients have been largely unsuccessful, as exemplified by the lack of clinical activity of farnesyltransferase
inhibitors, which interfere with critical posttranslational
modification of RAS proteins (33). Similarly, targeting downstream effectors of the Ras pathway has not yet been therapeutically effective (reviewed in ref. 34). In this context, one may
speculate that inhibition of specific Ras effector pathways may

clones, compared with vector-transfected cells. D, in vivo tumorigenicity was also partially rescued as observed in murine xenograft experiments.

be ineffective because either (a) the specific targeted pathways
are not critical for pancreatic cancer or (b) the multiple signal
transduction pathways activated by Ras provide some redundancy, necessitating simultaneous inhibition of more than one
effector pathway.
Given the impediments in therapeutic targeting of Ras effector pathways, our finding that CDK5 activity is required for
Ral activation may be quite significant for pancreatic cancer.
In prior reports by Counter and colleagues (12, 13), inhibition
of RalA signaling resulted in the abrogation of the malignant
phenotype in KRAS2-mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines,
whereas downregulation of RalB inhibited experimental (tail
vein injection) metastasis. These findings underscore the Ral
pathway as an important therapeutic target for pancreatic
cancer. Nevertheless, like other GTP-binding proteins in the
Ras family, Ral has been difficult to inhibit, although there
has been recent progress in use of a geranylgeranyltransferase
inhibitor in vitro for blocking Ral membrane localization (35).
Our data, showing that CDK5 inactivation results in the inhibition of Ral activation, identify a facile, druggable kinase target to access this important effector arm of the Ras signal
transduction pathway. Inhibition of CDK5 function alone in
pancreatic cancer cells is sufficient to abrogate the activation
of both Ral proteins, which may account for the observed phenotype of decreased tumorigenicity (through RalA inhibition)
as well as reduced systemic metastases (through the RalB
effector). Further, our experiments using CDK5 inhibition in
combination with the inhibition of other Ras effector pathways (Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8) suggest that such a
combination strategy may be especially effective in pancreatic
cancer. It is significant that CDK5 inhibitors are already in
pharmaceutical development (36, 37), in part because CDK5
has been considered a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases (reviewed in refs. 38, 39); therefore,
development of CDK5 as a therapeutic target for pancreatic
cancer could be relatively rapid.
The molecular mechanism by which CDK5 activity regulates Ral activation will be a fascinating focus of future study.
As is the case for other GTP-binding proteins in the Ras superfamily, the level of Ral activation corresponds to the level
of GTP occupancy of the Ral proteins, which is proximally
controlled by the action of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs, which load GTP) and GTPase-activating proteins (RalGAPs, which promote GTP hydrolysis to GDP).
There are five known RalGEFs; in contrast, although RalGAP
activity has been detected in cells (40, 41), a specific RalGAP
has only recently been identified (42). Activated Ras can

activate Ral by recruiting RalGEFs to the cell membrane,
where their nucleotide exchange function is activated allosterically (43). One may envision, for example, that CDK5 may
participate in the activation of Ral by direct phosphorylation
of Ral or a RalGEF, or indirectly, by phosphorylating an interacting protein, thus promoting guanine nucleotide exchange
or inhibiting GTPase activity. Alternatively, CDK5 may phosphorylate or otherwise deactivate a RalGAP or interacting
protein, inhibiting Ral GTPase activity and increasing GTP
occupancy. Control of other GEFs and GAPs by such phosphorylation events has been extensively documented
(reviewed in ref. 44). CDK5 itself has been reported to regulate the activity of modulating factors for other GTP-binding
proteins by direct phosphorylation of the GEF RasGRF2 (45),
release from sequestration of RhoGDI (46), or increased
expression of RhoGAP (47), further suggesting that such
mechanisms may underlie CDK5 regulation of Ral.
In summary, we show that the inhibition of CDK5 activity
antagonizes tumorigenic and metastatic properties of pancreatic cancer cells. CDK5 seems to inhibit Ras signaling in
these cells, blocking the critical Ral effector arm of the Ras
signal transduction pathway. Mutated Ras is central to tumorigenesis in the overwhelming majority of cases of pancreatic cancer and, therefore, has been considered a prime
therapeutic target for this disease. Unfortunately, both Ras
and Ral have been virtually intractable therapeutically. Our
demonstration that CDK5 activity is necessary for Ras pathway signaling and tumorigenic behavior in pancreatic cancer
provides optimism that selective kinase inhibitors of CDK5
may finally allow us to successfully address Ras as a therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.
