Abstract

Author Manuscript

Telomere crisis occurs during tumorigenesis when depletion of the telomere reserve leads to
frequent telomere fusions. The resulting dicentric chromosomes have been proposed to drive
genome instability. Here we examine the fate of dicentric human chromosomes in telomere crisis.
We observed that dicentric chromosomes invariably persisted through mitosis and developed into
50-200 μm chromatin bridges connecting the daughter cells. Before their resolution at 3-20 h after
anaphase, the chromatin bridges induced nuclear envelope rupture in interphase, accumulated the
cytoplasmic 3' nuclease TREX1, and developed RPA-coated single stranded (ss) DNA. CRISPR
knockouts showed that TREX1 contributed to the generation of the ssDNA and the resolution of
the chromatin bridges. Post-crisis clones showed chromothripsis and kataegis, presumably
resulting from DNA repair and APOBEC editing of the fragmented chromatin bridge DNA. We
propose that chromothripsis in human cancer may arise through TREX1-mediated fragmentation
of dicentric chromosomes formed in telomere crisis.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

The view that dicentric chromosomes are broken in mitosis and undergo breakage-fusionbridge (BFB) cycles originates from McClintock’s cytological observation of corn
chromosomes (McClintock, 1938; McClintock, 1941). More recently, the fate of dicentric
chromosomes has been studied in yeast as well as plants (reviewed in (Stimpson et al.,
2012)). Here, we document the behavior of dicentric chromosomes in human cells.

Dicentric chromosomes can be formed during the early stages of human tumorigenesis when
telomere shortening has led to dysfunctional telomeres (reviewed in (Artandi and DePinho,
2010)). Telomere shortening induces senescence or apoptosis when a few telomeres lose the
ability to repress DNA damage signaling pathways. Telomere fusions are infrequent in
senescence, most likely because of the low frequency of dysfunctional telomeres. Upon bypass of senescence due to loss of p53 and Rb, further telomere attrition increases the
incidence of telomere dysfunction, eventually leading to a telomere crisis where telomeres
fuse to form dicentric chromosomes. These dicentrics have been proposed to drive genome
instability in cancer. The genomic scars indicative of past telomere crisis have been
observed in several types of cancer (Lin et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2014; Roger et al., 2013;
Simpson et al., 2015). However, the fate of dicentric chromosomes, including potential BFB
cycles, has been elusive.

Author Manuscript

The genomic footprint of BFB cycles is a ‘fold-back’ inverted rearrangement that
demarcates a region of amplification from a terminal chromosomal deletion. Such events
have been observed in pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer and leukemias,
among others (Bignell et al., 2007; Campbell et al., 2010; Waddell et al., 2015; Li et al.,
2014; Nones et al., 2014). Interestingly, several of these studies have suggested an
association between the rearrangements of BFB cycles and chromothripsis (Nones et al.,
2014; Li et al., 2014). Chromothripsis is a mysterious mutational process in which one or
more localized chromosomal regions undergo catastrophic shattering, triggering a haphazard
repair process of stitching chromosomal fragments together in a random order and
orientation (Stephens et al., 2011). Chromothripsis has been observed across many tumor
types (Forment et al., 2012), especially those with p53 loss (Rausch et al., 2012), as well as
occasional occurrence in the germline (Kloosterman and Cuppen, 2013). Chromothripsis
breakpoints often show clusters of base substitutions localized nearby (kataegis), exhibiting
the C>T and C>G signature at TpC dinucleotides associated with APOBEC-mediated
mutagenesis (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012a; Roberts et al., 2012; Roberts et al., 2013; Chan et al.,
2015).

Author Manuscript

The mechanism of chromosome fragmentation that gives rise to chromothripsis in cancer is
not known and it is not clear when, where, and how the DNA fragments are rejoined. A
proposed explanation of the localized nature of chromothripsis is the sequestration of a
chromosome (fragment) in a micronucleus where it is shattered while the rest of the genome
remains intact (Zhang et al., 2015). Micronuclei in cancer cell lines show abnormalities in
DNA replication, transcription, and nuclear envelope (NE) structure, and display DNA
damage (reviewed in (Hatch and Hetzer, 2015). Importantly, micronuclei show frequent
nuclear envelope collapse, which could cause the aforementioned abnormalities (Hatch et
al., 2013). Chromothripsis was recently shown to arise after rupture of micronuclei
containing lagging chromosomes (Zhang et al., 2015). Therefore, a plausible scenario for the
origin of chromothripsis involves a lagging chromosome (fragment), formation of a
micronucleus that undergoes nuclear envelope collapse, DNA fragmentation due to impaired
DNA replication, and random joining of the DNA fragments upon their incorporation into
the primary nucleus (Zhang et al., 2015; Hatch and Hetzer, 2015).

Here we present data suggesting a telomere-based mechanism for chromothripsis in cancer.
Using inducible telomere crisis in vitro, we document chromothripsis and kataegis in half of
the descendant clones sequenced. Dicentric chromosomes formed through telomere fusion
persisted through mitosis and cytokinesis to form long chromatin bridges between the
daughter cells. The DNA in the chromatin bridges became partially single-stranded due to
attack by the major cytoplasmic 3’ nuclease, TREX1 (DNaseIII) (reviewed in (Rice et al.,
2015)). TREX1 appeared to gain access to the bridge DNA during transient nuclear
envelope rupture during interphase (NERDI) and its nucleolytic activity was required for the
timely resolution of the chromatin bridges. After bridge resolution, the partially ssDNA
generated by TREX1 rejoined the primary nuclei. We infer from sequence analysis of clones
emerging from telomere crisis that the ssDNA is processed by APOBEC3A/B-mediated
cytosine deamination (reviewed in (Roberts and Gordenin, 2014)) leading to kataegis and
that the DNA fragments are joined randomly to generate the hallmarks of chromothripsis.

RESULTS
An in vitro model for telomere crisis

Author Manuscript

To approximate telomere crisis in vitro, we generated a derivative of the hTERT expressing
RPE-1 retinal pigment epithelial cell line in which the Rb and p53 pathways were disabled
with shRNAs to Rb and p21 (see Table S1). To induce the telomere fusions typical of
telomere crisis, we used a dox-inducible dominant negative allele of TRF2 (TRF2-DN),
which deprotects telomeres and induces telomere fusions (van Steensel et al., 1998). As
expected, doxycycline induced the 53BP1-containing Telomere dysfunction-Induced Foci
(TIFs; (Takai et al., 2003)), which are indicative of TRF2-DN-induced ATM kinase
signaling (Karlseder et al., 1999); impaired proliferation; and generated metaphases with
telomere fusions (Figure 1A-E; Figure S1A,B). Whereas the dox-inducible clone T2cl24
showed infrequent fusions, a pool of TRF2-DN expressing cells (T2p1) showed telomere
fusions in a large fraction of the metaphases, allowing cell biological experiments (Figure
1A-E; Figure S1B). Despite the frequent telomere fusions, the induced T2p1 cells formed
micronuclei infrequently (Figure S1C).
Dicentric chromosomes persist through mitosis and cytokinesis

Author Manuscript

The behavior of dicentric chromosomes in mitosis was examined using spinning-disk
confocal imaging of H2B-marked chromatin in induced T2p1 cells, which developed
anaphase bridges in the majority of mitosis (see below Figure 2B) as expected since ~1% of
the 92 telomeres in these cells undergo fusion (Figure S1B). The images obtained with these
cells were similar to those described by McClintock (McClintock, 1938), showing apparent
cleavage of the chromatin bridges immediately before or during cytokinesis (Figure 1F;
Figure S1D,E; MovieS1, panel 1). Imaging with myrPALM-mTurquoise2 to mark the
plasma membrane (Zacharias et al., 2002) showed that the H2B signal was diminished only
at the site of ingression (Figure S1D,E; MovieS1, panel 2), indicating that the disappearance
of the H2B signal was likely due to the cleavage furrow pinching the chromatin. Indeed,
when ingression was blocked with the actomyosin inhibitor blebbistatin (Straight et al.,
2003), the dicentric chromosomes clearly remained intact (0/24 events) (Figure 1F;
MovieS1, panel 1). Thus, as is the case in budding yeast (Haber et al., 1984; Lopez et al.,

2015; Hill and Bloom, 1989), mammalian dicentric chromosomes can withstand the forces
of the mitotic spindle and do not break before cytokinesis. This result is not unexpected
given that the spindle force (0.5-1.5 nN) is insufficient to break a mitotic chromosome,
which can withstand at least 100 nN (Houchmandzadeh et al., 1997). Cells with dicentrics
did not show a delay in their progression through mitosis (Figure S1F) although tubulin
remained associated with the midbody slightly longer (Figure S1G,H; MovieS1, panel 3).
Dicentric chromosomes develop into long chromatin bridges

Author Manuscript

To monitor the fate of the dicentric chromosomes after cytokinesis, we captured 108
adjacent fields by spinning-disk confocal imaging at 10 min intervals for 24-48 h (Figure
S2A,B). Computational joining of the fields (Preibisch et al., 2009) allowed ~1,000 cells to
be followed for two days (MovieS2). This ‘stitching’ microscopy of H2B-mCherry labeled
cells showed that daughter cells migrated away from each other despite their connecting
chromatin bridge (Figure 2A-D; MovieS3). The chromatin bridges, which were detectable
with YOYO-1 in fixed samples (Figure 2C), developed with high frequency and measured
50-200 μm before breaking (Figure 2B,D). The H2B-mCherry intensity on the bridges
appeared diminished and the IF signals for histones H2A, H2B, and H4 were low (Figure
S2C), suggesting the loss of nucleosomes, perhaps due to the stretching of the chromatin
bridge (Bennink et al., 2001).

Author Manuscript

The chromatin bridges remained intact for 3-20 h with a median persistence time of ~9.3 h
(Figure 2E). Bridge resolution was apparent from a sudden change in morphology, the rapid
movement of bridge remnants towards the primary nuclei, and the rapid movement of the
daughter cells away from each other (MovieS3). The primary nuclei were often heart-shaped
with invaginations opposite from the chromatin bridge, suggesting that the fused
chromosome(s) were pulling at the nuclear envelope (Figure 2A,C; Figure S2D; MovieS3).
After bridge resolution, a small tail of chromatin was observed that shortened and eventually
disappeared, most likely because the nuclear envelope regained its rounded state (Figure
S2E). In some cases the bridge remnant persisted until the next mitosis (see below). The
chromatin bridges did not appear to give rise to micronuclei (0 out of >100 events scored).

Author Manuscript

To determine the timing of bridge resolution relative to the cell cycle stage of the connected
cells, we examined mTurquoise2-RPA70 patterns in the primary nuclei. At the time of
bridge rupture, most primary nuclei had diffusely distributed RPA, indicating that they were
not yet in S phase. When >90% of the bridges were resolved at 20 h, fewer than 20% of the
primary nuclei showed the punctate S phase RPA pattern indicative of S phase (Figure 2E;
Figure S3A-C). Therefore, most chromatin bridges were resolved before DNA replication in
the primary nuclei. EdU labeling showed no signal on the bridge DNA, suggesting that the
chromatin bridges did not undergo aberrant premature DNA replication (Figure 2F).
Chromatin bridges accumulate RPA-coated ssDNA
Although the chromatin bridges resolved before the primary nuclei entered S phase, ~80%
of the bridges contained RPA before and/or at the time of their resolution (Figure 2G,H;
Figure S3A-F). IF for endogenous RPA32 and imaging of mTurquoise2-RPA70 showed a

punctate pattern on the bridges that developed into bright domains just before resolution
(Figure 2G,H; Figure S3A,B; MovieS3, panel 2).
After bridge resolution, the RPA-coated domains became embedded in the primary nucleus
or persisted as short connected tails before joining a daughter nucleus after the next mitosis
(Figure S3C-F). Once resolved, the bridge remnants showed the presence of γH2AX,
53BP1, and Mre11 (Figure S3G-I), indicating chromatinization of the DNA and activation
of the DNA damage response.

Author Manuscript

RPA-coated chromatin bridges were also observed after deletion of the shelterin protein
TIN2 from mouse cells (Takai et al., 2011). Furthermore, RPA accumulated on chromatin
bridges induced by TRF2-DN in the HTC75-T4 cell line, which is derived from the human
HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line (Figure S4A-C) (van Steensel et al., 1998). Finally, RPA was
present on chromatin bridges resulting from lagging chromosomes induced by either
inhibition of the Mps1 kinase (Santaguida et al., 2010) or treatment with nocodazole (Figure
S4D-G), suggesting that the formation of ssDNA is not a peculiarity of chromatin bridges
formed by dicentrics resulting from telomere fusions.
Chromatin bridges have an altered nuclear envelope

Author Manuscript

IF for the transmembrane nuclear envelope protein LAP2 showed that the chromatin bridges
were surrounded by NE (Figure 3A and B). Similarly, BAF1, which binds chromatin and
helps assemble the nuclear lamina was detectable on the chromatin bridges (Figure S4F). In
contrast, IF for Lamins A/C and B1, Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) (detected by mAb414
and α-TPR), and the NE proteins SUN1, SUN2, and MAD1 suggested that while the
chromatin bridges contained an NE, its composition was altered (Figure 3C-F; Figure S4F).
Specifically, the intensity of Lamin A/C and Lamin B1 staining gradually diminished as the
bridges extended and several NE components (e.g. NPCs, SUN1/2, and MAD1) were not
detectable (Figure 3C-F; Figure S4F). Interestingly, Lamin B1 was also depleted from the
NE of the primary nuclei (Figure 3E).
Cells with chromatin bridges undergo NERDI

Author Manuscript

Some of the cells with chromatin bridges appeared to transiently lose RPA from one of the
primary nuclei with a concomitant increase of the RPA signal in the cytoplasm (Figure 2G,
asterisk). This mis-localization of RPA70 could be explained if the cells experienced
NERDI. In micronuclei, NE collapse drives an irreversible loss of compartmentalization
(Hatch et al., 2013) whereas in several cancer cell lines, NERDI of the main nucleus is
transient (Vargas et al., 2012). Relevant to the anomalous Lamin B1 staining observed in
nuclei connected by chromatin bridges (Figure 3E), Lamin B1 depletion exacerbates NERDI
(Vargas et al., 2012).
To assay for NERDI, we used a fusion of three tandem copies of mTurquoise2 and the
nuclear localization signal (NLS) of SV40 large T, which is confined to the nucleus when
the NE is intact. Time-lapse imaging showed that cells with chromatin bridges had frequent
and short-lived (~5 min) NERDI as evidenced by the appearance of cytoplasmic
NLS-3xmTurq2 and its diminished intensity in the nucleus (Figure 3G,H; MovieS4). After
NERDI, the nuclear envelope regained its integrity and retained the NLS-3xmTurq2 marker.

Cells that did not contain TRF2-DN (vp1; Table S1) and non-induced T2p1 cells exhibited
at least one NERDI event in 20% of daughter cell pairs within 6 h of anaphase (Figure 3I).
This high baseline rate of NERDI is likely due to p21 and/or Rb inactivation since NERDI
was infrequent in the parental RPE1-hTERT cells (Figure 3I). Importantly, NERDI
frequency increased to nearly 60% in dox-induced T2p1 daughter cells with chromatin
bridges (Figure 3I). NERDI usually occurred in one of the two connected nuclei. Because
NERDI can be induced by Lamin B1 depletion (Vargas et al., 2012), we tested whether
Lamin B1 or LAP2β overexpression could repress the nuclear envelope rupture in induced
Tp21 cells (Figure 3I). Overexpression of both proteins diminished the frequency of NERDI
(Figure 3I). Lamin B1 overexpression strongly diminished RPA accumulation on chromatin
bridges suggesting that the formation of ssDNA on chromatin bridges depended on NERDI
(Figure 3J). We conclude that telomere dysfunction in this cell system induces a significant
increase in NERDI. As a result, at least one of the two cells connected by a chromatin bridge
is likely to experience a NERDI event within the time period preceding bridge resolution.
Chromatin bridge DNA is processed by the cytoplasmic 3’ exonuclease TREX1

Author Manuscript

Although we initially queried nuclear nucleases, the frequent NERDI suggested that
cytoplasmic nuclease might attack the chromatin bridges to generate ssDNA. IF showed that
the major cytoplasmic 3’ exonuclease TREX1 was present on the chromatin bridges in cells
undergoing telomere crisis whereas TREX1 was only observed in the cytoplasm of control
cells (Figure 4A). TREX1 also localized to chromatin bridges induced by telomere
dysfunction in the HTC75-T4 cell line and to chromatin bridges formed by lagging
chromosomes induced by nocodazole (Figure S4A and G). IF analysis and imaging of the
inactive mTurq2-tagged TREX1-D18N (Lehtinen et al., 2008) indicated that this nuclease
often appears on the chromatin bridges before their rupture (Figure 4B,C; MovieS5). IF for
TREX1 in micronuclei induced by monastrol also showed TREX1 accumulation specifically
in micronuclei that had undergone NE rupture (Figure 4D,E).

Author Manuscript

To test the role of TREX1 in the generation of ssDNA, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to derive
TREX1 KO subclones from the T2p1 telomere crisis cell line (Figure S5A,B). Loss of
TREX1 was demonstrated by immunoblotting and IF (Figure 4F; Figure S5C,D) and
sequence analysis revealed bi-allelic CRISPR gene editing (Figure S5E). The TREX1 KO
cell lines showed normal proliferation and, after induction of TRF2-DN, displayed the
expected reduced proliferation and chromatin bridges (Figure S5F,G). Importantly, IF
showed a nearly complete abrogation of the accumulation of RPA on the chromatin bridges
in the TREX1 KO cells (Figure 4G,H). This absence of RPA accumulation could be
reversed by reintroduction of wild type TREX1, whereas the inactive TREX1-D18N did not
have this effect (Figure 4F-H). Consistent with a previous report (Lehtinen et al., 2008),
TREX1-D18N had a dominant-negative effect in the TREX1-proficient parental cell line,
significantly reducing the appearance of RPA on the chromatin bridges (Figure 4F-H). In
contrast, overexpression of the wild type allele in the parental Tp21 cell line slightly
increased the accumulation of RPA on the chromatin bridges. As a control, we confirmed
that TREX1 deficiency did not diminish RPA foci formed during replication stress (Figure
S5H,I).

TREX1 deletion from the HTC75-T4 cell line also strongly diminished RPA accumulation
on chromatin bridges (Figure S4B,C). Furthermore, chromatin bridges resulting from
lagging chromosomes induced by Mps1 kinase inhibition failed to accumulate RPA when
TREX1 was absent (Figure S4D-F). Thus, TREX1 deficiency generally affects the
formation of RPA-containing ssDNA in chromatin bridges.
Cells lacking TREX1 showed a significant delay in the resolution of chromatin bridges
(Figure 4I). At 20 h post-anaphase, only 15% of the chromatin bridges in the TREX1proficient cells remained whereas more than 40% of the bridges of the TREX1 KO cell line
were still intact. The timing of bridge resolution was restored by wild type TREX1 but not
by TREX1-D18N. TREX1-independent mechanisms also contribute to the resolution of the
chromatin bridges, since resolution was not abrogated by TREX1 deficiency.

Frequent chromothripsis in post-crisis clones
To determine the genetic alterations induced by telomere crisis, we isolated post-crisis
subclones of T2p1 and T2cl24. Clones were karyotyped to exclude those that had escaped
the telomere dysfunction (Figure S6 and Table S2). Clones with aneuploidy and/or marker
chromosomes were analyzed by telomere fusion PCR to confirm the presence of telomere
fusion (Figure S6C). Ten such post-crisis clones were selected for sequence analysis, as
were the parental T2p1, one post-crisis subclone with the parental karyotype (24.2), and
seven control subclones derived from uninduced T2p1 cells. We performed whole genome
sequencing on all 19 lines, comparing post-crisis whole genome sequencing data with that
from the parental lines, in order to identify mutations acquired during the telomere crisis.
None of the subclones derived from the uninduced T2p1 cells showed genomic alterations.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Strikingly, 5 of 10 post-telomere crisis lines showed clusters of genomic rearrangements
affecting one or more chromosomes (Figure 5; Figure S7A). These rearrangements exhibited
the hallmarks of chromothripsis, including spatial clustering, randomness of fragment
orientation and oscillating copy number states (Figure 5A,B; Figure S7A) (Korbel and
Campbell, 2013). In several examples, the rearrangements were near telomeres and
associated with terminal deletions of the chromosome, consistent with products of telomere
fusion. Chromothripsis events that are more internal in the chromosomes can also result
from telomere fusions since the genomic region in the bridge could be far from the telomere
depending on the structure of the dicentric. Sometimes the clustered rearrangements affected
one chromosome, sometimes two or three, as has been observed in cancers (Stephens et al.,
2011). Importantly, chromothripsis never involved whole chromosomes, but rather was
localized to the specific regions that presumably resided in the chromatin bridge. Consistent
with these results, chromothripsis was recently reported in cells that were subjected to TRF2
inhibition and an Mps1 kinase inhibitor (Mardin et al., 2015).
The oscillations of copy number in regions of apparent chromothripsis often sampled three
copy number states. Such a scenario can arise either from a chromothripsis event
simultaneously affecting two copies of the same genomic region or from a subsequent
duplication of part of a chromothripsis chromosome. These two possibilities can be
distinguished by the patterns of copy number changes across breakpoints in the region (Li et
al., 2014). In all examples observed here, the patterns of copy number and rearrangements

implied that two copies of the affected genomic regions were simultaneously subjected to
the catastrophic shattering and repair of chromothripsis (Figure 5; Figure S7). Two copies
could derive from the end-to-end fusion of sister chromatids that form the chromatin bridge.
Kataegis accompanies chromothripsis
The recruitment of RPA suggested that chromatin bridges contain extensive ssDNA. As
ssDNA represents one of the target substrates for APOBEC enzymes, we hypothesized that
the regions caught up in the chromatin bridge would show clusters of point mutations,
known as kataegis, analogous to those seen in cancers (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012a; Nik-Zainal
et al., 2012b; Roberts et al., 2012).

Author Manuscript

We observed 29 clusters of point mutations from 7 of the 10 post-crisis samples sequenced
here that were absent from the parental cell lines. These clusters exhibited the cardinal
features of kataegis observed in human cancers. First, clusters were often found within a
kilobase or two of genomic breakpoints (Figure 6A-D). This was predominantly in
association with chromothripsis rearrangements, although occasional clusters were also
found near simpler structural variants (Figure 6C). Secondly, the clusters exhibited a
pronounced preference for C>T and C>G mutations occurring in a TpC context (Figure
6E,F), the classic signature of APOBEC3A/B activity ((Roberts et al., 2013; Burns et al.,
2013a; Burns et al., 2013b); reviewed in (Roberts and Gordenin, 2014)). Thirdly, the
mutation clusters were processive, indicative of the damage occurring on a single strand of
DNA (Figure 6A,B).

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript

The findings reported here suggest that chromothripsis and kataegis can arise as a
consequence of telomere crisis in the early stages of human tumorigenesis (Figure 7). The
dicentric chromosomes formed in telomere crisis developed into long chromatin bridges that
connect the two primary nuclei until the bridge breaks. Three important events in cells with
chromatin bridges can explain the observed chromothripsis and kataegis. First, one of the
connected primary nuclei undergoes NERDI that allows entry of the cytoplasmic 3’
exonuclease TREX1. Second, TREX1 generates extensive ssDNA in the chromatin bridges.
Third, TREX1-mediated processing contributes to the resolution of the bridge, leaving two
bridge DNA remnants that each join their primary nucleus. Subsequent repair of the bridge
remnant DNA results in random joining of DNA segments typical of chromothripsis. In
addition, APOBEC-derived hypermutation is prominent at the boundaries of the rearranged
sequences. Since APOBEC enzymes act on ssDNA, the observed kataegis is consistent with
the extensive single-stranded nature of the bridge remnants.

Author Manuscript

Complex clusters of structural variants have been observed in many cancer genomes.
Chromothripsis is an extreme example of such clusters, with tens to hundreds of genomic
rearrangements affecting one or a few chromosomes or chromosome regions. Especially
high rates have been observed in sarcomas, esophageal cancers and neuroblastomas (Nones
et al., 2014; Stephens et al., 2011; Garsed et al., 2014; Mehine et al., 2013), and there
appears to be an association with telomere crisis, especially BFB cycles (Li et al., 2014).
Our study strengthens this association, suggesting that one of the routes to the chromosome

damage that precipitates chromothripsis could be chromatin bridges formed by dicentric
chromosomes.
While this study suggests that telomere crisis can precipitate chromothripsis events in
cancer, many mechanistic questions remain. These issues are briefly discussed below.
Formation of extended chromatin bridges

Author Manuscript

Chromatin bridges have been documented and observed numerous times upon induction of
telomere fusions in a wide variety of cell lines, but their significance, duration, and eventual
fate had not been determined. In all cases, the chromatin bridges were observed in adherent
tissue culture cells. We do not know whether chromatin bridges also develop if cells are
grown in soft agar or indeed if such bridges would occur when incipient cancer cells
undergo telomere crisis in vivo. Presumably, cell migration is not limited to tissue culture
settings and takes place in the mass of cells that eventually gives rise to overt cancer. Cell
motility is well documented in wound healing and is promoted by the epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancers of epithelial origin (Scheel and Weinberg, 2012).
Furthermore, modeling suggests that cell migration is an important contributor to cancer
development (Waclaw et al., 2015).
NERDI in cells with chromatin bridges

Author Manuscript

In cells with chromatin bridges, NERDI is more frequent and occurs sooner after anaphase.
What is the mechanism by which chromatin bridges induce NERDI? One possibility is that
the long bridges simply deplete critical NE components (e.g. Lamin B1, Lamin A/C) from
the primary nuclei, thus inducing the transient failure in compartmentalization. A second
possibility is that the stretching of the bridge exerts mechanical forces on the primary nuclei
that overwhelm the resilience of the NE. Indeed, the shape of many of the primary nuclei
suggests that considerable pulling forces are exerted by the chromosome(s) in the bridge but
further work is required to understand the exact mechanism by which NERDI occurs. The
attachment of human chromosomes to the nuclear lamins (Guelen et al., 2008) could play a
role in generating the observed distortions and contribute to NERDI induction.
Preferential TREX1 action on bridge DNA

Author Manuscript

Why does TREX1 accumulate on the bridge and attack the bridge DNA rather than affecting
the chromatin of the primary nucleus undergoing NERDI? One explanation could be that the
bridge DNA is in a non-canonical chromatin state. It is possible that the pulling force of the
migrating daughter cells results in loss of nucleosomes from the chromatin in the bridge
(reviewed in (Chien and van Noort, 2009)). This mechanical nucleosome removal is
consistent with the diminished staining for histones on the chromatin bridges. If TREX1
preferentially binds naked dsDNA, it would be expected to accumulate more on the nonnucleosomal bridge DNA than on the chromatin in the primary nucleus. Indeed, TREX1
degrades naked DNA much faster than nucleosomal DNA (Chowdhury et al., 2006) but
whether this effect is due a higher affinity for naked DNA is not known.
Since TREX1 is a 3’ exonuclease, it will require nicked DNA substrates for the generation
of ssDNA. Indeed, TUNEL staining has previously shown free 3’ ends on a chromatin

bridge (Gisselsson et al., 2001). The nicks in the bridge DNA could originate from
RNaseH2-mediated removal of misincorporated ribonucleotides (Reijns et al., 2012).
Another possibility is that the TREX1 associated endonuclease NM23-H1 generates the 3’
ends used by the exonuclease (Chowdhury et al., 2006). So far, we have failed to detect
NM23-H1 on the chromatin bridges but its abundance there may simply be too low for
detection.
Bridge resolution

Author Manuscript

Bridge resolution is strongly correlated with a sudden increase in RPA staining, suggesting
that the formation of ssDNA is a critical step. In the absence of TREX1, no or very low
amounts of RPA are detected on the chromatin bridges. The residual RPA staining could be
due to another nuclease or could be due to the over-stretching of the DNA, which can lead to
RPA-coated denatured DNA in vitro (van Mameren et al., 2009). Although TREX1 is not
solely responsible for bridge resolution, it significantly enhances the rupture of the bridges.
We imagine that rupture occurs when two TREX1 3’ exonucleases acting on the Watson and
Crick strands meet.
Conclusions
Telomere crisis has previously been shown to give rise to aneuploidy, non-reciprocal
translocations, and whole genome reduplication (Artandi et al., 2000; Davoli and de Lange,
2012; Davoli et al., 2010). The data presented here suggest that chromothripsis and kataegis
can be added to the list of cancer-relevant genome alterations that could be the consequence
of telomere crisis. It will therefore be of interest to develop better tools to detect telomere
crisis in the early stages of cancer. Methods to detect telomere crisis in pre-cancerous lesions
may have predictive power with regard to disease progression and outcome.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
(additional Experimental Procedures available in Supplemental Materials)
Cell Culture Procedures and plasmids

Author Manuscript

RPE1-hTERT and Phoenix cells from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were
cultured as described by the ATCC. Drug treatments, retroviral transduction, and cell
cloning were performed using standard conditions (see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures). CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts were generated with sgTREX1-2, 5’GAGCCCCCCCACCTCTC-(PAM)-3’ using the gRNA cloning vector (Addgene) and cotransfection with an hCas9 plasmid (Addgene) by nucleofection (Lonza apparatus). Clones
were isolated by limiting dilution, screened for TREX1 deletion by immunoblotting, and
sequenced.
Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence
Immunoblotting and IF were performed using standard protocols. Cells were incubated with
EdU for 30 min prior to PFA fixation and EdU detection with a Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor
647 imaging kit (Life Technologies).

Live-cell Imaging

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated onto 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek) 48 h before imaging. One h
before imaging, the media was replaced with phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium. Live cell
imaging was performed at 37°C and 5% CO2 using a CellVoyager CV1000 spinning-disk
confocal system (Yokogawa, Olympus) equipped with 445, 488, and 561 nm lasers, a
Hamamatsu 512 × 512 EMCCD camera, and pinhole size of 50 μm. Details of image
acquisition, processing, and quantification are given in the Supplemental Materials.
Telomere fusion PCR and karyotypic analysis
PCR for telomeric fusions and metaphase telomere fusion assays were performed essentially
as described (Letsolo et al., 2010; Capper et al., 2007). Karyotypes were determined using
standard protocols.

Author Manuscript

X-ten sequencing and mapping
Genomic DNA sequencing libraries were synthesized on robots and cluster generation and
sequencing were performed using the manufacturer pipelines. Average sequence coverage
across the samples was 33.3x (range, 27.4-35.9x). Mapping to genome build hs37d5 was
performed using the BWA algorithm (BWA mem 0.7.8 (Li and Durbin, 2010)).
Copy number analysis

Author Manuscript

The reference genome divided into windows of equivalent read numbers (Campbell et al.,
2008; Li et al., 2009) was used to extract reads with a mapping quality of at least 35 and the
following flags: Properly paired; Non-secondary; QC-pass; Non-duplicate; Nonsupplementary. Reads overlapping with each window were counted using BEDTools
(Quinlan, 2014) and copy numbers were inferred from read depth data (Li et al., 2014).
Rearrangement calling and chromothripsis
Clusters of abnormally paired read pairs were identified from the merged sequence data
using an in-house algorithm ‘Brass’. Raw rearrangement calls supported by clusters of
abnormally mapped read pairs were called if the clusters were formed of at least four read
pairs all from the same sample. For X-37, which yielded noisier data, at least six read pairs
were required. The raw rearrangements were filtered as described previously (Li et al.,
2014).
Mutation calling and kataegis

Author Manuscript

Point mutations were called using an in-house algorithm ‘Caveman’ as before (Nik-Zainal et
al., 2012a) with RPE-1/Rbsh/p21sh/rtTA (Table S1) as reference. Raw mutations filtering is
described in the Supplemental Materials. Kataegis mutation clusters were detected using
visual inspection based on the criteria of short inter-mutation distance (generally <2kb)
between cytosine mutations that were processive and enriched with TpC context.

Figure 5. Chromothripsis and kataegis in post-crisis clones 24-141 and X-25

Author Manuscript

(A) Chromothripsis and rainfall plot of sample 24-141 involving chromosomes 7 and 12.
(B) Chromothripsis and rainfall plot of sample X-25 involving chromosomes 4, 13 and X.
The unbalanced rearrangements involving chromosomes 8 and 12 may have taken place
together with the chromothripsis event. In (A) and (B), top: the arcs represent the two ends
of rearrangements. Arcs are grouped from top to bottom by the type of rearrangement
orientation as follows: deletion (D; +-); tandem duplication (TD; -+); tail-tail (TT; ++);
head-head (HH; --). Middle: estimated copy number over genomic windows. The variant
allele frequency (VAF) track is shown below the copy number track. Inferred copy number

segments are shown below the VAF track. Bottom: amount of copy number change between
copy number segments. Chromothripsis after a duplication will yield three copy number
states with copy number steps of +1 or -1. Duplication after chromothripsis will yield some
copy number steps of +2 or -2. Filled circles: positions of point mutations colored by
mutation type. The Y-axis shows the distance of each mutation to the next on the same
chromosome, with the respective axis on the right-hand side of the graph. Red arrows:
kataegis clusters.

Figure 6. Mutational patterns of kataegis in post-crisis clones

Author Manuscript

(A) A chromothripsis-associated kataegis in sample 24-141 on chromosome 7.
(B) A kataegis event in sample X-25 on chromosome X. This kataegis event took place on a
chromosome with evidence for chromothripsis, but the rearrangements associated with the
kataegis event do not appear to be part of the chromothripsis (Figure 5B). For both (A) and
(B), the top panel shows raw read coverage of the region. The horizontal arrows indicate the
positions of rearrangements. The two horizontal lines in the middle panel represent the
forward and reverse strands. The pyrimidine strands of the mutations called are indicated by
their placement on one of the two strands. Mutations are colored by mutation type. The
bottom panel magnifies the mutation cluster regions and shows mutation contexts.
(C) The number of kataegis events grouped by their association with rearrangements as
follows. From top to bottom: kataegis events within 10 kb of a chromothripsis
rearrangement; kataegis events on a chromothripsis chromosome within 10 kb of a non-

chromothripsis rearrangement; kataegis events on a chromothripsis chromosome with no
rearrangements within 10 kb; kataegis events on a non-chromothripsis chromosome within
10 kb of a rearrangement; and kataegis events on non-chromothripsis chromosome with no
rearrangements within 10 kb.
(D) The distance of each of the 31 detected kataegis events to their nearest respective
rearrangement breakpoint.
(E) The frequency distribution of mutation types in the detected kataegis clusters.
(F) The nucleotide context around the mutated cytosine grouped by cytosine mutation type.
The relative positions shown are on the pyrimidine (cytosine) strand. The Y-axes show the
fraction of each nucleotide on the pyrimidine strand.

Figure 7. The fate of dicentric chromosomes formed in telomere crisis

Author Manuscript

Telomere fusions in telomere crisis give rise to anaphase bridges that persist and develop
into chromatin bridges. Cells with chromatin bridges undergo frequent NERDI and TREX1
accumulates on the chromatin bridge. TREX1 generates RPA-marked ssDNA in the
chromatin bridge before their resolution. The RPA marked bridge remnants eventually join
the primary nucleus where DNA repair and APOBEC3A/B editing are inferred to take place.
Clonal descendants derived from telomere crisis cells show chromothripsis and kataegis.
