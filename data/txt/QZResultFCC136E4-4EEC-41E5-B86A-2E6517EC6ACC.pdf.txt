Abstract:
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is an emerging treatment option for non-Hodgkin
lymphoma (NHL) producing higher overall response and complete remission rates
compared with unlabelled antibodies. However, the majority of patients treated
with conventional or myeloablative doses of radiolabelled antibodies relapse. The
development of RIT with alpha-emitters is attractive for a variety of cancers because
of the high linear energy transfer (LET) and short path length of alpha-radiation in
human tissue, allowing higher tumour cell kill and lower toxicity to healthy tissues. In
this study, we investigated the molecular effects of the alpha-emitter Bi-213 labelled
to anti-CD20 antibodies ([Bi-213]anti-CD20) on cell cycle and cell death in sensitive
and radio-/chemoresistant NHL cells. [Bi-213]anti-CD20 induced apoptosis, activated
caspase-3, caspase-2 and caspase-9 and cleaved PARP specifically in CD20-expressing
sensitive as well as in chemoresistant, beta-radiation resistant and gamma-radiation
resistant NHL cells. CD20 negative cells were not affected by [Bi-213]anti-CD20 and
unspecific antibodies labelled with Bi-213 could not kill NHL cells. Breaking radio-/
chemoresistance in NHL cells using [Bi-213]anti-CD20 depends on caspase activation
as demonstrated by complete inhibition of [Bi-213]anti-CD20-induced apoptosis with
zVAD.fmk, a specific inhibitor of caspases activation. This suggests that deficient
activation of caspases was reversed in radioresistant NHL cells using [Bi-213]antiCD20. Activation of mitochondria, resulting in caspase-9 activation was restored and
downregulation of Bcl-xL and XIAP, death-inhibiting proteins, was found after [Bi213]anti-CD20 treatment in radio-/chemosensitive and radio-/chemoresistant NHL
cells. [Bi-213]anti-CD20 seems to be a promising radioimmunoconjugate to improve
therapeutic success by breaking radio- and chemoresistance selectively in CD20expressing NHL cells via re-activating apoptotic pathways through reversing deficient
activation of caspases and the mitochondrial pathway and downregulation of XIAP
and Bcl-xL.

CD20, a non-glycosylated 33 kDa transmembrane
phosphoprotein appearing to be involved in the regulation
of B-cell growth and differentiation [2], is due to its
characteristics a promising target for immunotherapy of

CD20-antibodies (Rituximab/anti-CD20) [2]: It has a low
membrane turnover and furthermore, it is expressed stably
on more than 90% of all malignant NHL cells, normal
B-cells but not on stem cells, mature plasma cells or other
tissues [3, 4]. Rituximab is the first monoclonal antibody
licensed for immunotherapy of NHL and is applicated as
monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutics
[5, 6]. Despite the promise of therapy with unmodified
antibodies and the improvement in overall response
rates and survival of patients with NHL, only 6% to
20% of patients achieve complete remissions while
significant numbers of relapsed patients can be observed
[5, 6]. RIT could be proven promising to overcome the
limitations of unconjugated antibodies: The anti-CD20radioimmunoconjugates [I-131]tositumomab (Bexxar®)
and [Y-90]ibritumomab-tiuxetan (Zevalin®) produce
higher overall response and complete remission rates
compared with unlabelled antibodies [7]. The majority of
patients treated with conventional or myeloablative doses
of radiolabelled anti-CD20-antibodies, however, also
relapse [7]. The development of RIT with alpha-emitters
such as Bi-213 is promising for treatment of a variety of
cancers and is attractive because of the high linear energy
transfer (LET) and short path length of alpha-radiation in
human tissue, allowing higher tumour cell kill and lower
toxicity to healthy tissues [8-12].
Apoptosis can be stimulated via the external
pathway induced by the specific binding of death ligands
to their receptors (e.g. CD95/CD95 ligand) or by the
mitochondrial pathway [13]. Activation of either pathway
leads to the activation of the caspase cascade in which
initiator caspases (like caspase-2 and caspase-9) as well
as effector caspases (e.g. caspase-3 or caspase-7) are
involved leading to the concerted destruction of the cell
[14].
Resistances against chemotherapeutics and/or
radiation in cancer therapy, which are one the primary
causes for therapeutic failure, can be a result of changes
in the apoptotic pathways [15-17]. The Bcl-2 family of

proteins including pro-apoptotic members like Bax and
anti-apoptotic members like Bcl-xL regulate the integrity
of the outer mitochondrial membrane. [18-21]. The
majority of human cancers harbour high levels of inhibitor
of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as the well characterised
X-linked IAP (XIAP) [22]. Chemo-/Radioresistance
of NHL are often associated with the overexpression of
different molecules like XIAP or Bcl-xL [22]. Targeting
these proteins by inhibition or downregulation is a
novel approach in cancer therapy [23]. Recently, it was
shown that the alpha-emitter Bi-213 labelled to an antiCD45-antibody has the capacity to abrogate chemo- and
radioresistance in leukaemia cells via caspase activation
and activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in
vitro [24].
In general, the increasing employment of so-called
targeted alpha-therapies (TAT) leads to the question how
these particles exhibit their cytotoxicity in cancer cells
and which signalling cascades are involved – but only
few studies have been published [24-29]. Therefore, we
investigated the molecular effects of the alpha-emitter
Bi-213 labelled to anti-CD20 antibodies ([Bi-213]
anti-CD20) on the cell cycle and cell death in radio-/
chemosensitive as well as in radio-/chemoresistant NHL
cells. We clarified the molecular mechanisms for cell death
induction and overcoming of radio-/chemoresistance. Our
study demonstrates that after a G2-phase arrest, [Bi-213]
anti-CD20 leads to apoptosis induction via activation of
caspases using the mitochondrial pathway in sensitive as
well as in radio- and chemoresistance in NHL B-cells.
In addition, [Bi-213]anti-CD20 induces apoptosis in
NHL which are resistant to anti-CD20 antibodies or to
antibodies labelled with Y-90. [Bi-213] bound to antiCD20 seems to be a promising therapeutic strategy in the
treatment of NHL especially if conventional therapeutic
modalities failed.

Results

with different activity concentrations (225, 75, 22.5kBq/
mL) of [Bi-213]anti-CD20 using a specific activity of
~4MBq/µg antibody. 24h and 48h after applying the
radioimmunoconjugates, a time and dose-dependent
induction of apoptosis could be detected in DoHH-2
cells (Figure 2A). The unlabelled anti-CD20-antibody
which was used in a concentration of about 56ng/mL
equivalent to the amount of radiolabelled antibody
applicated for 225 kBq/mL [Bi-213]anti-CD20 showed
no cytotoxicity (Figure 2A). Next, we assessed whether
the radioimmunconjugate induced cell death is specifically
triggered by [Bi-213]anti-CD20 or whether it is an
unspecific side-effect of the applied Bi-213. Therefore, we
treated the CD20-negative AML cell line HL-60 with [Bi213]anti-CD20 using comparable activity concentrations
and specific activities (Figure 2B). In the non-targeted
HL-60 cells (Figure 2B) only a slight induction of cell
death could be observed in comparison to the CD20expressing DoHH-2 cells (Figure 2A), demonstrating
that [Bi-213]anti-CD20 induces apoptosis specifically
in CD20-expressing cells. In addition, we analyzed the
cytotoxic potential of [Bi-213]anti-HER2-antibody ([Bi213]anti-HER2) on HER2-negative DoHH-2 cells which
hence cannot target treated DoHH-2 cells specifically
(Figure 2C). 24h and 48h after treating DoHH-2 cells
using 225, 75 and 22.5kBq/mL [Bi-213]anti-HER2 with a
specific activity of ~4MBq/µg antibody, respectively, just
a small fraction of cells could be observed to be apoptotic
(Figure 2C). This demonstrates that [Bi-213]anti-CD20

[Bi-213]anti-CD20 induces cell death specifically in
CD20-positive NHL cells
Anticancer drugs, beta- as well as gamma-radiation
are known to induce apoptosis and to activate apoptotic
pathways in leukaemia, lymphoma and solid tumours [13,
16, 24]. Furthermore, also the radioimmunoconjugate [Bi213]anti-CD45 induces cell death via apoptosis in CD45positive leukaemia cells [24].
As monoclonal anti-CD20-antibodies alone or as
radioimmunoconjugate labelled with Y-90 or I-131 are
employed in the treatment of NHL with quite good results
[7], we wanted to determine the cytotoxic potential of
anti-CD20-antibodies in in vitro settings applied as TAT
approach using the alpha emitter Bi-213. The NHL cell
line DoHH-2 (Figure 1A) as well as the beta-radiation
resistant cell line DoHH-2 (DoHH-2betaR) (Figure 1B)
and gamma-radiation resistant cell line DoHH-2 (DoHH2gammaR) (Figure 1C) express comparable amounts of the
CD20-antigen on their surface as shown by flow cytometry
analysis. Therefore, these cell lines can be directly targeted
using the anti-CD20-radioimmunoconjugate.
First, we analyzed whether [Bi-213]anti-CD20
induces cell death in the NHL B-cell line DoHH-2 and
which type of cell death can be induced by targeted
alpha-radiation. Therefore, we treated the DoHH-2 cells

anti-CD20 or unlabelled anti-CD20 (anti-CD20), respectively. The amount of unlabelled anti-CD20 antibodies corresponds to the one used
for the highest activity concentration of the radioimmunoconjugate [Bi-213]anti-CD20. (B) [Bi-213]anti-CD20 leads to minor cell kill in

as indicated. (C) anti-HER2 does not kill HER2-negative (HER2-/-) NHL cells strongly. HER2-negative DoHH-2 cells were incubated with

respective radioimmunoconjugate, the percentages of apoptotic cells were measured by FSC/SSC-analysis. The percentage of specific cell

cells in medium (%)]. Columns, mean of triplicates; bars, SD <10%.

minor damage in surrounding healthy tissue.

DoHH-2 (DoHH-2gammaR) (Figure 3B) cells which are
cross-resistant to different chemotherapeutics and resistant
to anti-CD20 labelled with the beta-emitter Y-90 ([Y-90]
anti-CD20), with 225, 75, 22.5kBq/mL of [Bi-213]antiCD20 using a specific activity of ~4MBq/µg antibody. A
strong induction of apoptosis was detected in DoHH-2betaR
and DoHH-2gammaR cells after 24h and 48h (Figure 3A,B).
Applicating the corresponding amount of unlabelled antiCD20 antibodies showed no cytotoxicity. This indicates
that [Bi-213]anti-CD20 overcomes gamma-resistance and
beta-radiation resistance such as Y-90, [Y-90]anti-CD20
resistance, as well as chemoresistance. The unspecific
radioimmunoconjugate [Bi-213]anti-HER2 led to smaller

chemoresistance in CD20-positive NHL cells
[Bi-213]anti-CD45 could be shown to overcome
chemo- and radioresistances in CD45-expressing
leukaemia cells [24]. We analyzed whether also [Bi-213]
anti-CD20 has the potential to abrogate resistances and
to re-activate defective apoptotic signalling pathways
in radio- and chemoresistant CD20-positive NHL cells.
Therefore, we treated the beta-radiation resistant DoHH-2

overcomes radio- and chemoresistance in CD20-positive (CD20+/+) beta-radiation resistant (DoHH-2betaR) (A) and gamma-radiation

5Gy Cs-137 (DoHH-2gammaR) (B) and cross-resistant to different chemotherapeutics were incubated with different activity concentrations
of [Bi-213]anti-CD20 as indicated or unlabelled anti-CD20 (anti-CD20), respectively. The amount of unlabelled anti-CD20 antibodies
corresponds to the one used for the highest activity concentration of the radioimmunoconjugate [Bi-213]anti-CD20. (C,D) [Bi-213]antiHER2 does not induce a strong cell death in HER2-negative (HER2-/-) DoHH-2betaR (C) or HER2-negative (HER2-/-) DoHH-2gammaR cells

(A,B,C,D) After 24h (white columns) and 48h (black columns), the percentage of apoptotic cell death was measured by FSC/SSC-analysis.

could be activated in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
Caspase-2 was activated, resulting in a minor reduction of
the zymogen. Furthermore, PARP, the prototype caspase
substrate [31], could be shown to be effectively processed
(Figure 5A,B). This suggests that [Bi-213]anti-CD20
activates caspases in radio-/chemosensitive as well as in
radio-/chemoresistant DoHH-2 NHL cells, indicating that
defective activation of caspases was reversed in the radio-/
chemoresistant DoHH-2 cells. In contrast to [Bi-213]antiCD20 targeting in radio-/chemosensitive DoHH-2 and
radio-/chemoresistant DoHH-2gammaR or DoHH-2betaR cells,
the unspecific radioimmunoconjugate [Bi-213]anti-HER2
could not activate caspase-3, caspase-9, and caspase-2
(Figure 5C). Only at the highest activity concentration
(225kBq/mL) a slight activation of caspases could
be observed (Figure 5C). Similar data were obtained
analysing the effects of [Bi-213]anti-CD20 on the AML
cell line HL-60 which does not express the CD20-antigen
(Figure 5D). These results demonstrate that [Bi-213]
anti-CD20 activates caspases and apoptotic pathways
selectively in targeted CD20 positive NHL cells.
The importance of caspase activation in cell death
induction of [Bi-213]anti-CD20 was further analyzed with
the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. When co-treated
with zVAD.fmk and [Bi-213]anti-CD20, the fraction of
dead cells in the radio-/chemosensitive DoHH-2 (Figure
6A) as well as in the radio-/chemoresistant DoHH-2betaR
(Figure 6B)and DoHH-2gammaR (Figure 6C) cell lines
diminished nearly completely. This underlines that
apoptosis induction depends on the activation of caspases
in radio-/chemosensitive and in radio-/chemoresistant
NHL cells. The deficient activation of caspases was
reversed in resistant NHL cells after [Bi-213]anti-CD20
treatment.
IAPs and Bcl-xL play a critical role in resistance
of tumours to conventional therapies [22, 32, 33]. The
anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL prevents permeabilisation of the
mitochondrial membrane during apoptosis induction and

[Bi-213]anti-CD20 leads to changes in the cell cycle
distribution in CD20-positive NHL cells
Ionizing radiation interrupts the normal cell cycle
progression in mammalian cells by activating cell cycle
checkpoints. Once these are activated, cells are arrested
either in G1/S-, S- or G2/M-phases of the cell cycle
until the damage is repaired. If no repair is possible
apoptosis is induced [30]. We measured propidium iodide
stained nuclei via flow cytometry in order to measure
the subdiploid DNA content of cells (sub-G1) - a central
hallmark of apoptotic cells - and cell cycle distribution of
DoHH-2 cells (Figure 4). We found a G2/M-phase arrest
and an increase in the fraction of cells with subdiploid
DNA content depending on activity concentrations (Figure
4).

[Bi-213]anti-CD20 reversed deficient caspase
activation in CD20-positive radio-/chemoresistant
NHL cells
To clarify which molecular mechanisms are
involved in [Bi-213]anti-CD20 induced apoptosis and
which are restored in breaking radio-/chemoresistance, we
examined the induced signalling pathways by Western-blot
analyses. After treating the radio-/chemosensitive DoHH2 cells (Figure 5A) as well as the radio-/chemoresistant
DoHH-2betaR and DoHH-2gammaR cells (Figure 5B) for
24h and 48h with activity concentrations of 225, 75 and
22.5kBq/mL [Bi-213]anti-CD20, the effector caspase-3
(Figure 5A,B) and the initiator caspase-9 (Figure 5A,B)

Figure 4: [Bi-213]anti-CD20 arrests the cell cycle in G2/M-phase in CD20-positive NHL cells. CD20-positive (CD20+/+)

DoHH-2 cells were left untreated (Control) or incubated with different activity concentrations of [Bi-213]anti-CD20 as indicated. 20h
after applying the radioimmunoconjugate [Bi-213]anti-CD20, the DNA content and cell cycle distribution could be analysed using flow
cytometry. The apoptotic cells were determined by analysis of hypodiploid nuclei (black line, sub-G1). Cells in G1-phase have nuclei with
a diploid DNA content (G1, nuclei in G1-phase) and cells in G2-phase nuclei with a tetraploid DNA content (G2, nuclei in G2/M-phase).

~37kDa, the active fragment of caspase-3 at ~19kDa and ~17kDa and PARP cleavage at ~85kDa. Equal protein loading was controlled

Bcl-xL overexpression is linked to apoptosis resistance
of NHL cells. Among the IAP family proteins, XIAP
displays the strongest anti-apoptotic properties and
inhibits apoptosis signalling by binding to active caspase-3
and by preventing caspase-9 activation [34]. Inhibition
of XIAP by XIAP-inhibitors or Bcl-xL by using Bcl-xLantisense oligonucleotides sensitizes cancer cells for
chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation [32]. After incubation
with different activity concentrations (225, 75, 22.5 kBq/
mL) of [Bi-213]anti-CD20, we detected a downregulation
of Bcl-xL, downregulation of XIAP and cleavage of XIAP
in radio-/chemosensitive DoHH-2 (Figure 7A) cells as
well as in the radio-/chemoresistant DoHH-2betaR and
DoHH-2gammaR cells (Figure 7B). In addition, treating the
HER2-negative DoHH-2 NHL cells with [Bi-213]antiHER2 (Figure 7C) or the radio-/chemoresistant DoHH2betaR and DoHH-2gammaR cells with [Bi-213]anti-HER2

(Figure 7C) or the CD20-negative HL-60 cells with [Bi213]anti-CD20 (Figure 7D) did not lead to significant
changes in the protein levels of Bcl-xL or XIAP. These
results indicate that [Bi-213]anti-CD20 reversed deficient
activation of caspases and apoptotic pathways via
downregulation of XIAP and Bcl-xL specifically in CD20positive NHL cells.

Discussion
B-cell NHL comprise a heterogeneous group
of lymphoproliferative malignancies with different
biological behaviour and treatment response [35]. In
many NHL patients, the natural course of disease is one
of increasing resistance ultimately leading to treatment
failure [36]. Immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies
like Rituximab targeting the B-cell-antigen CD20 has

been widely accepted for the treatment of NHL [37].
Despite encouraging clinical results with anti-CD20antibodies, however, the majority of patients relapse
[6, 7]. Recently, RIT with [I-131]tositumomab and [Y90]ibritumomab-tiuxetan has emerged as promising
treatment option for NHL as it could be observed that the
radioimmunoconjugates lead to higher overall response
and complete remission rates if compared with unlabelled
antibodies [7, 38-40]. Nevertheless, only 1.5% and 17%

of the total energy for Y-90 and I-131 are estimated to be
deposited in a tumour of 200µm in diameter, while the
remainder is deposited in surrounding healthy tissues
leading to dose-limiting toxicities [41]. Alpha-emitters
like Bi-213 and At-211 with high linear energy transfer
(LET) and short path length in human tissue, allow higher
specific tumour cell kill and lower toxicity to healthy
tissues [42, 43].
[Bi-213]anti-CD45 could be shown to induce

performed for Bcl-xL and XIAP after 24h and 48h. Downregulation of Bcl-xL was detected at ~30kDa and XIAP was detected at ~58kDa
and its degradation product at ~30kDa. Equal protein loading was controlled using an anti-β-Actin-antibody.

NHL cells. The highest absorbed dose of radioactivity
in the studies corresponds to 1.5 Gy whereas the cells
are resistant against 5 Gy of beta- or gamma-radiation,
respectively, underlining once more the possibility of
reducing the total applicated dose of radioactivity. Our
findings suggest that TAT is a promising approach for the
treatment of relapsed and radio-/chemoresistant NHL.
Radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs induce
apoptosis by activating apoptotic pathways in cancer
cells [13]. Deficient induction of apoptotic pathways was
found in cancer cells resistant to conventional therapies
[17]. Our study demonstrates that [Bi-213]anti-CD20
triggers the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis leading
ultimately in the recruitment of the caspase cascade in
targeted CD20-positive NHL cells. In addition, [Bi213]anti-CD20 reverses deficient activation of caspases
in targeted radio-/chemoresistant CD20-positive NHL
cells through mitochondria activation. After treatment
with [Bi-213]anti-CD20, caspase-3 activation and hence
PARP cleavage were observed in radio-/chemosensitive
as well as in radio-/chemoresistant CD20-positive NHL
cells. Formation of the cytochrome-c/Apaf-1/caspase-9containing apoptosome complex plays a critical role in
mitochondrial activation [46]. We found that caspase-9
was activated after treatment with [Bi-213]anti-CD20 in
radio-/chemosensitive as well as in radio-/chemoresistant
CD20-positive NHL cells, demonstrating that the
mitochondrial pathway is involved in apoptosis induction
and deficient activation of caspase-9 and of mitochondria
is reversed in radio-/chemoresistant CD20-positive NHL
cells after [Bi-213]anti-CD20 treatment.
In many studies, the clinical relevance of the
expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins was analyzed
using immunohistochemistry or gene expression profiling
[47]. These data show that NHL cells display a defective
apoptosis regulation provoked by the overexpression of
the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and XIAP [48, 49].
XIAP appears to be one of the strongest inhibitors of
the apoptotic machinery and suppresses apoptosis by
preventing activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 [50].
The anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL prevents permeabilisation of
the mitochondrial membrane during apoptosis induction.
Treatment with [Bi-213]anti-CD20 mediated the
downregulation of XIAP as well as Bcl-xL, underlining that
[Bi-213]anti-CD20 induced cell death depends on XIAP
and Bcl-xL in NHL cells and restores deficient activation
of apoptotic pathways. This implies that [Bi-213]antiCD20 therapies might improve the therapeutic success
of NHL patients with resistances against conventional
treatment modalities due to altered expression levels of
XIAP and Bcl-xL.
Taken together, our study reveals that [Bi-213]antiCD20 induces apoptosis selectively in CD20-expressing
NHL cells using the mitochondrial pathway. [Bi-213]
anti-CD20 is a promising radioimmunoconjugate to
improve therapeutic success by breaking radio- and

apoptosis in CD45-expressing leukaemia cells whereby its
efficiency to kill leukaemia cells is much greater than that
of comparable activities of beta- and gamma-radiation [24]
which might lead to a reduction of the overall applicated
concentration of radioactivity. Furthermore, it is a wellestablished concept that the amount of the vehicle can
be reduced drastically if employed in radiotherapies in
comparison to monotherapies. We could demonstrate that
the radioimmunoconjugate [Bi-213]anti-CD20 induced
apoptosis specifically in CD20-positive NHL DoHH-2
cells whereas the unlabelled antibody could not exhibit
any cytotoxicity due to its low concentration. [Bi-213]antiHER2, which could not target DoHH-2 cells, displayed
only minor cytotoxic effects even if high activities were
applied. In addition, [Bi-213]anti-CD20 could not exhibit
its destructive potential in CD20-negative HL-60 cells.
This suggests that [Bi-213]anti-CD20 kills selectively
CD20-positive NHL cells with limited side-effects.
These data are in line with previously published studies.
Vandenbulcke [28] could show that [Bi-213]anti-CD20
induced significantly higher cell death rates in cells to
which the antibody had a higher binding capacity. In a
second study [27], they demonstrated that [Bi-213]antiCD20 killed chronic lymphatic leukaemia cells more
effectively than external gamma-irradiation underlining
the importance of this novel therapeutic approach [27].
Similar results were also found in CD45-expressing
leukaemia cells treated with [Bi-213]anti-CD45 [24].
Survival analyses of B-cell lymphoma cell cultures and
haematopoietic progenitor cells, derived from the bone
marrow, indicated a high tumour cell-to-normal bone
marrow cell toxicity ratio of [At-211]anti-CD20 [44, 45].
Although the bone marrow cells are inherently sensitive
to alpha-radiation, a much higher cell kill in the tumour
cells could be shown underlining once more the specific
targeting of the radioimmunoconjugate [44]. As irradiation
of healthy cells and tissues cannot be avoided in RIT,
the applied activities have to be chosen to induce only
acceptable damages to these. Nevertheless, pre-targeted
TAT using anti-CD20-antibody-streptavidin constructs
and Bi-213-radiolabelled biotin in a mouse NHL xenograft
model was well-tolerated with no treatment-related
mortalities and a high therapeutic efficacy resulting in
a significant prolongation of survival in all treated mice
[41]. Due to the pre-targeting, the tumour-to-background
ratio could be increased minimizing non-specific radiation
exposure to healthy organs [41].
Major problems in the treatment of NHL are relapses
and resistances which might develop during anti-cancer
treatment. Alpha-particles have been shown to overcome
chemo- and radioresistance in leukaemia cells [11, 24]. We
could demonstrate that [Bi-213]anti-CD20 can also induce
cell death in beta-radiation- and gamma-radiation-resistant
CD20-positive NHL cells cross-resistant to a variety of
anti-cancer drugs indicating that [Bi-213]anti-CD20
breaks radioresistance and chemoresistance in targeted

were used. Quality controls were performed via ITLC.
Activities were applied to the cells using 225, 75, and 22.5
kBq/mL of Bi-213 labelled to the respective antibodies
with specific activities of ~4 MBq/µg.

Methods

Determination of apoptosis and cell cycle analysis
24h
or
48h
after
applying
the
radioimmunoconjugates, quantification of apoptosis
and cell cycle analysis were done by flow cytometry as
described [24, 53, 54]. To determine apoptosis, cells were
lysed with Nicoletti buffer containing 0.1% sodium citrate
plus 0.1% Triton X-100 and 50 µg/mL propidium iodide at
4°C [53]. The percentage of apoptotic cells was measured
by hypodiploid DNA (subG1) content [53] or forward
scatter/side scatter analysis [54] using flow cytometry
(FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany).

Cell culture
The CD20-positive human NHL B-cell line DoHH-2
and the CD20-negative acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
cell line HL-60 were obtained from DMSZ (Braunschweig,
Germany). The cells were grown in suspension in RPMI
supplemented with 1 mmol/L glutamine (Invitrogen,
Karlsruhe, Germany), 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Invitrogen), 25 mmol/L HEPES (Biochrom AG, Berlin,
Germany) and 10% FCS (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium)
at 37°C, 5% CO2. Radiation resistant cell lines were
generated tolerating 5 Gy of gamma-irradiation (Cs-137;
DoHH-2gammaR) or 5 Gy of beta-irradiation (Y-90; DoHH2betaR), respectively. Both radioresistant cell lines are
cross-resistant to a subset of chemotherapeutics such as
doxorubicin, cisplatin, and etoposide.
Prior to incubation with the radiolabelled antibodies,
the cells were seeded in a density of 105 cells/mL.

Determination of CD20-expression on the cell
surface
The NHL cell lines DoHH-2, DoHH-2betaR and
DoHH-2gammaR were stained with 10µl phycoerythrin (PE)labelled mouse anti-CD20-IgG1 antibody according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Biozol, Eching, Germany).
Immunofluorescence analyses were performed using flow
cytometry. Mouse IgG1-antibodies (Southern Biotech,
Birmingham, USA) as isotype control were used to assess
the unspecific binding of the anti-CD20-PE-antibody.

Antibodies
The recombinant humanized anti-CD20-mab
Rituximab (MabThera®, Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
consists of a human IgG1 kappa constant region, with
a variable region isolated from a murine anti-CD20antibody specific for the CD20-antigen overexpressed on
NHL cells [3, 4]. In vivo, it exhibits a low immunogenic
potential [51]. The antibody was chelated with CHX-A``DTPA and stored at 4°C.
The recombinant humanized mab Trastuzumab
(Herceptin®, Roche) was chelated with CHX-A``DTPA and stored at 4°C. This antibody (anti-HER2) is
immunoreactive against the epidermal growth factor
receptor HER2 and thereby inhibits the proliferation and
survival of expressing cells [52].

Caspase inhibition by zVAD.fmk
To determine the role of caspase activation in cell
death induction, the cells were pre-treated for one hour
with 50µM of the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk (z-ValD,L-Asp-fluoromethylketone, Bachem, Heidelberg,
Germany). After 24h or 48h an analysis of the cell viability
was performed by FSC/SSC measurements.

Western-blot analysis
Prior to the performance of immunoassays whole
cell lysates were generated as previously described [24].
The proteins of interest were probed using rabbit-antiPARP (1:1000, Roche), rabbit-anti-caspase-3, rabbitanti-caspase-9 (both 1:1000, Cell Signaling, Boston,
USA), rabbit-anti Bcl-xL (1:500, Santa Cruz, Heidelberg,
Germany), as well as mouse-anti-caspase-2, mouse-antiXIAP (both 1:1000, BD Transduction Laboratories). For
detection enhanced chemiluminescence was employed
after incubating the membranes with horseradish
peroxidase labelled goat-anti-rabbit or goat-anti-mouse
IgG (1:5000, Santa Cruz), respectively. Mouse-anti-βActin (1:5000, Sigma, Seelze, Germany) was used as

Radionuclides and radiolabelling of antibodies
Bi-213 with a half-life of 45.6 min decays by a
branched pathway by alpha-/beta-emissions to stable
Bi-209 [42]. Of the emitted energy 80% is deposited by
alpha-particles with energies of 8.4 MeV (79%) and 5.9
MeV (1%) [42]. Bi-213 for the antibody radiolabelling
was derived from an Ac-225/Bi-213 generator system.
