Summary
The HIF transcription factor promotes adaptation to hypoxia and stimulates the growth of certain
cancers, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The HIFα subunit is usually prolylhydroxylated by EglN family members under normoxic conditions, causing its rapid degradation.
We confirmed that TNBC cells secrete glutamate, which we found is both necessary and sufficient
for the paracrine induction of HIF1α in such cells under normoxic conditions. Glutamate inhibits

the xCT glutamate-cystine antiporter, leading to intracellular cysteine depletion. EglN1, the main
HIFα prolyl hydroxylase, undergoes oxidative self-inactivation in the absence of cysteine both in
biochemical assays and in cells, resulting in HIF1α accumulation. Therefore, EglN1 senses both
oxygen and cysteine.

Graphical Abstract

Introduction
Breast cancers expressing the estrogen receptor, especially when they also express the
progesterone receptor, are usually treated with hormonal manipulations, whereas those
expressing the HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase are often treated with HER2 antagonists. New
therapies and biomarkers are needed for triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which do
not express these receptors and are highly lethal.

Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF) is a master transcriptional regulator of genes that support
adaptation to hypoxia, including genes that promote angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, glycolysis,
autophagy and energy conservation (Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008). HIF can promote or
suppress tumor growth in a context-dependent manner (Blouw et al., 2003; Keith et al.,
2012). In mouse models HIF promotes the growth, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer
cells, including TNBC cells (Chaturvedi et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014; Montagner et al.,
2012; Regan Anderson et al., 2013; Schito et al., 2012; Semenza, 2012; Wong et al., 2012;
Zhang et al., 2012).

Author Manuscript

HIF consists of an unstable alpha subunit and a stable beta subunit. Under normoxic
conditions HIFα is prolyl-hydroxylated by the EglN (also called PHD) 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenases, with EglN1 (PHD2) being the main HIFα prolyl hydroxylase
(Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008). The pVHL ubiquitin ligase complex recognizes prolylhydroxylated HIFα and marks it for proteasomal degradation (Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008).
The EglN oxygen KM values allow them to act as oxygen sensors, with their hydroxylase
activity falling when oxygenation is inadequate (Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008). In some
models, hypoxia generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can inhibit EglN activity
although how, mechanistically, ROS inhibits EglN remains unclear (Kaelin, 2005).
Therefore, HIF accumulates in hypoxic tissues.

HIF activation is common in solid tumors because they typically contain regions that are
hypoxic due to poor blood flow. Additionally, many cancer-relevant mutations induce HIF
irrespective of hypoxia. Cells lacking pVHL, such as most clear cell renal carcinoma cells
(ccRCCs), accumulate high HIF levels due to impaired HIFα degradation. HIFα degradation
is also decreased in Succinate Dehydrogenase and Fumarate Hydratase mutant tumors
because they accumulate succinate and fumarate, respectively, which inhibit EglN activity
(Kaelin and Ratcliffe, 2008). Cancers with activating mTOR mutations accumulate high
HIF1 levels due to increased HIF1A transcription and translation (Kaelin and Ratcliffe,
2008). Therefore HIF activation in solid tumors can reflect bona fide hypoxia or the effects
of oncogenic mutations on HIF synthesis and turnover.

HIF Is Upregulated in TNBC
We performed immunohistochemical studies of breast cancer tissue microarrays using
antibodies against HIF1α and HIF2α. In keeping with earlier reports, both proteins were
readily detected in a subset of breast tumors, especially in TNBCs (Figures 1A and 1B) (Bos
et al., 2002; Laurinavicius et al., 2012; Talks et al., 2000; Zhong et al., 1999). Consistent
with these findings, various HIF-responsive mRNAs, such as the CXCR4, BNIP3, CAIX,
EGLN1, PDK1, VEGF, GLUT1, and ADM mRNAs, were increased in TNBCs relative to
other breast cancer subtypes (Figure 1A).

Author Manuscript

Increased HIFα protein levels in TNBC could reflect intratumoral hypoxia in vivo. Increased
HIF1α protein levels were also noted, however, in subconfluent TNBC cell lines grown
under well-oxygenated conditions (Figures 1C and S1A) and, in some cases, approached the
HIF1α levels in VHL−/− ccRCC lines (Figure 1D). We did not reproducibly detect HIF2α in
TNBC cell lines, and therefore focused on HIF1α in the experiments below.
Increased HIF1α protein levels in the TNBC cell lines correlated with increased levels of
HIF1α–responsive mRNAs (Figure 1E). VEGF mRNA induction in TNBC lines was more
variable, however (data not shown), possibly because it is mainly regulated by the HIF1α Cterminal transactivation domain that, unlike the HIF1α N-terminal transactivation domain, is
suppressed by Factor Inhibiting HIF1 (FIH1) under normoxic conditions (Kaelin and
Ratcliffe, 2008).

Author Manuscript

In keeping with prior studies (Chaturvedi et al., 2013; Regan Anderson et al., 2013; Schito et
al., 2012; Semenza, 2012; Wong et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012), two different HIF1α
shRNAs suppressed orthotopic tumor formation by a TNBC line, suggesting that HIF1α
deregulation promotes TNBC growth (Figures S1B–E). We therefore sought the mechanism
responsible for normoxic accumulation of HIF1α in TNBC.
TNBC Cells Secrete a Small Molecule HIF1α Stabilizer
HIF1α accumulation in TNBC lines is posttranscriptional because HIF1A mRNA levels are
not increased in TNBC cell lines compared to other breast cancer subtypes (Figure 1E). Of
note, the protein levels of the EglNs that mark HIFα for destruction are not decreased in
TNBC lines compared to hormone-responsive and HER2-positive breast cancer lines (Figure

S1F). Moreover, the EglN-pVHL axis appeared to be functionally intact because freshly
plated breast cancer lines, including the TNBC lines MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T, had low
HIF1α levels that were robustly induced by hypoxia (Figure 2A). HIF1α accumulated in the
TNBC lines to levels comparable to VHL−/− RCC4 ccRCCs, however, after 24–48 hours in
culture under normoxic conditions (Figures 1D and 2B). In contrast, no such accumulation
was noted in T47D hormone-responsive breast cancer cells (Figure 2B).

Author Manuscript

These observations suggested that a factor secreted by TNBC cells induces HIF1α. In
support of this idea, the conditioned media from MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T cells induced
HIF1α when added to freshly plated Hs578T cells (Figure 2C). This effect was specific,
because HIF1α was not induced by conditioned media from hormone-responsive MCF7 and
T47D breast cancer cells, or by conditioned media from RCC4 cells (Figure 2C). Moreover,
the conditioned media from Hs578T cells did not induce HIF1α when added to freshly
plated hormone-responsive breast cancer cells (Figure S2A).

Author Manuscript

To study this further, we made an Hs578T breast cancer subclone harboring a firefly
luciferase (FLuc) reporter driven by a HIF-responsive (3xHRE) promoter. Conditioned
media from parental Hs578T cells, but not T47D cells, increased FLuc activity in this
subclone (Figure 2D). The prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) and
fresh media served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Consistent with these
observations, Hs578T-conditioned media also induced endogenous HIF target gene
expression when added to freshly plated Hs578T cells (Figure 2E). Hs578T-conditioned
media, but not fresh media, stabilized HIF1α when added to freshly plated Hs578T cells, as
evidenced by the slower disappearance of HIF1α after adding cycloheximide (Figures 2F
and 2G). Collectively, these results suggest that TNBC cells can both secrete and respond to
a factor that stabilizes HIF1α under normoxic conditions.
We next treated freshly plated Hs578T cells with fresh media or Hs578T-conditioned media
and measured prolyl-hydroxylated HIF1α at varying timepoints after proteasomal blockade
with MG132 using an antibody specific for HIF1α hydroxylated at proline 564. The total
amount of HIF1α in the presence of fresh media and conditioned media was comparable
after 6 hours of MG132 treatment, which is again consistent with conditioned media acting
primarily at the level of HIF1α stability (Figures 2H and 2I). Notably, prolyl-hydroxylated
HIF1α (both absolute and relative to total HIF1α) was decreased at each of the earlier
timepoints in cells treated with Hs578T-conditioned media compared to cells fed fresh
media (Figures 2H and 2I), suggesting that TNBC cells secrete a factor that suppresses
HIF1α prolyl hydroxylation and thereby stabilizes HIF1α.

L-Glutamate Is Sufficient to Induce HIF1α
This factor was not inactivated by boiling or multiple freeze/thaw cycles, was insensitive to
RNAse, DNAse and Proteinase K treatment, was less than 3 kDa in size, and was eluted by
water from C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) columns, as measured by its ability to induce
FLuc in the Hs578T 3xHRE-FLuc cells (Figure 3A and data not shown). The C18 water
eluate was then further fractionated by HPLC (Figures 3B and 3C). NMR spectroscopy of
the HPLC fraction containing the maximal HIF-inducing activity revealed the presence of

glutamate, as well as several other metabolites including lysine, serine, malate, 2,3diaminopropionate and inositol.

Author Manuscript

Of these potential mediators, only L-glutamate acutely induced HIF1α in TNBC cells when
added to fresh media (Figures 3D and 3E, and data not shown). This effect was specific
because it was not seen with D-glutamate, L-glutamine, or L-aspartate (Figure 3D).
Moreover, L-glutamate, like TNBC-conditioned media, did not induce HIF1α when added to
T47D breast cancer cells, or RCC4 cells (Figure 3E), but did induce HIF1α in PC-9 lung
cancer cells, M34 melanoma cells, immortalized astrocytes, and a subset of glioma lines,
indicating that HIF1α induction by L-glutamate is not unique to TNBC (Figure S2B–G).
Importantly, these L-glutamate effects were seen at concentrations comparable to the Lglutamate concentrations achieved in TNBC conditioned media, and the ability of
conditioned media from T47D cells, MDA-MB-231 cells, and Hs578T cells to induce
HIF1α correlated with their L-glutamate concentrations (Figures 2C and 3F–3H).
xCT Is Required for L-Glutamate Secretion by TNBC
We reasoned that glutamate secretion by TNBC cells might be mediated by the xCT cystineglutamate antiporter (encoded by SLC7A11), which has been linked to glutamate secretion
by cancer cells and implicated as a potential therapeutic target in TNBC (Narang et al.,
2003, 2007; Timmerman et al., 2013; Yang and Yee, 2014). In TNBC, high xCT protein
levels are an independent predictor of poor prognosis (Figure S3). In keeping with earlier
reports, we found that the xCT protein is detectable in all of the breast cancer lines we
tested, but to varying degrees (Figure 4A). Eliminating xCT with either shRNA or CRISPRbased gene editing modestly inhibited Hs578T cell proliferation under standard cell culture
conditions (Figure S4A–C).

Author Manuscript

Pharmacologically inhibiting xCT with (S)4-carboxyphenylglycine [(S)4-CPG],
sulfasalazine (SAS), or growth in L-cystine-free media, decreased glutamate accumulation
in Hs578T-conditioned media (Figure 4B). Of note, neither (S)4-CPG nor SAS affected
Hs578T proliferation at these concentrations. (S)4-CPG and SAS did, however, inhibit
Hs578T proliferation at concentrations above 1 mM and 500 µM, respectively, in a way that
is likely off-target as revealed by the sensitivity of Hs578T cells lacking xCT to these two
agents (Figure S4D–H).

Author Manuscript

Consistent with our results with pharmacological xCT inhibitors, downregulating SLC7A11
with four independent shRNAs decreased L-glutamate secretion (Figures 4C and 4D). This
effect was on-target because it was reversed by expressing an shRNA-resistant SLC7A11
cDNA (Figures 4E and 4F). As expected, the conditioned media from cells expressing an
effective SLC7A11 shRNA did not induce HIF1α unless supplemented with exogenous Lglutamate (Figure 4G). Together with the data in Figure 3, these results indicate that Lglutamate is secreted by xCT and is both sufficient and necessary for TNBC-conditioned
media to induce HIF.
HIF1 reportedly can regulate SLC7A11 in some cells, including breast cancer cells (Lu et
al., 2015; Sims et al., 2012). However, xCT levels did not correlate with HIF1α levels in our
breast cancer cell line panel (compare Figure 1C with Figure 4A) and, unlike the well-

studied HIF1α target BNIP3, was unaffected by effective HIF1A shRNAs or DMOG (Figure
S1B and C). Perhaps some of the previously described effects of hypoxia on SLC7A11 were
caused by redox stress and induction of the SLC7A11 regulator NRF2 instead of HIF.
The highest xCT levels we detected were in Hs578T cells (Figure 4A), which secrete very
high amounts of L-glutamate (Figures 3G and 3H). Nonetheless, differences in xCT levels
do not fully explain the differences in glutamate secretion between TNBC cells and
hormone-responsive cells such as T47D and ZR75-1 (compare Figure 4A to Figures 3G and
3H). Conceivably other differences, such as differences in glutamate metabolism, play a
role. Growing Hs578T cells in media containing 13C-glutamine confirmed that the glutamate
they secrete is derived from glutamine (Figure 4H and 4I), consistent with reports that
TNBC cells avidly consume glutamine and are glutamine auxotrophs (Gross et al., 2014;
Timmerman et al., 2013).

Inhibition of xCT by Glutamate Depletes Intracellular Cysteine and Induces HIF1α
How does glutamate induce HIF1α? We reasoned that glutamate might act through a
glutamate receptor, such as metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (GRM1), which is expressed
by some breast cancers (Mehta et al., 2013; Speyer et al., 2012). However, HIF1α induction
by glutamate in TNBC lines was not blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists such as the
GRM1 antagonists, BAY 36-7620 and JNJ 16259685; or the GRM2/3 antagonist, LY
341495 (data not shown). Nor was HIF1α induced by glutamate receptor agonists such as
the GRM1/5 agonist, (S)-3,5-DHPG; the AMPA and GRM1/5 agonist, L-quisqualic acid; the
GRM2/3 agonist, DCG IV; or the GRM4, 6–8 agonist, L-AP4 (data not shown).

Author Manuscript

In the course of our xCT inhibition experiments, however, we noted that HIF1α was induced
in TNBC cells in which xCT activity was pharmacologically or genetically suppressed
(Figures 5A, 5B and S4A). The xCT inhibitor SAS also inhibited EglN activity in vivo, and
stabilized HIF1α, as determined by bioluminescent imaging of reporter mice that
ubiquitously express a HIF1α-FLuc fusion protein (Figures 5C, S5A and S5B). Moreover,
extracellular glutamate inhibits xCT activity with a Ki of ~150 µM (Makowske and
Christensen, 1982), which is below the glutamate concentration we measured in TNBCconditioned media (see Figures 3F and 3G). We confirmed that 600 µM L-glutamate
inhibited xCT, as shown by decreased cystine uptake, decreased intracellular cystine and
cysteine, and increased intracellular glutamate (Figures 5D, 5E, S5C and S5D), without
affecting cellular proliferation (data not shown). Collectively these observations suggested
that extracellular glutamate induces HIF by inhibiting xCT and decreasing cystine uptake.

Author Manuscript

Consistent with this idea, HIF1α was induced in Hs578T cells grown in cystine-poor media
(0 or 0.05 mM cystine compared to standard culture media, which contains 0.2 mM cystine),
while high cystine levels reversed the effects of exogenous L-glutamate (Figures 5A and 5F).
Notably, these manipulations did not affect HIF1α in MCF7 cells, which were likewise
insensitive to TNBC-conditioned media (Figures S2A, S5E and S5F). Treating Hs578T cells
with β-mercaptoethanol (BME), which promotes cystine uptake in an xCT-independent
manner (Ishii et al., 1981; Janjic and Wollheim, 1992), also reversed the effects of glutamate
on HIF1α (Figure 5G).

Neither cystine depletion nor treatment with L-glutamate lowered 2-OG levels, making loss
of this EglN cofactor an unlikely explanation for their ability to induce HIF1α (Figure 5E).
Cystine depletion was associated, however, with decreased intracellular cysteine levels and
the effects of L-glutamate on HIF1α were reversed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC)(Figures 5E
and 5G).
Cysteine is used to make the ROS scavenger, reduced glutathione (GSH). Increased ROS can
inhibit EglN in some cellular contexts (Kaelin, 2005). Glutathione (reduced/oxidized) was
not, however, decreased in TNBC cells deprived of cystine or treated with L-glutamate under
conditions sufficient to induce HIF1α (Figure S5H). As a control, we did detect decreased
glutathione levels in cells treated with the glutathione synthase inhibitor, buthionine
sulfoximine (BSO)(Figure S5H). Moreover, ROS was not increased in cells treated with Lglutamate (Figure S5I).

Author Manuscript

As an alternative way to monitor ROS, we exploited the fact that ROS inactivates the
KEAP1 ubiquitin ligase and thereby stabilizes NRF2 (Sporn and Liby, 2012). Cystine
depletion and L-glutamate treatment did not increase NRF2 (Figure 5F) and did not activate
an exogenous NRF2-FLuc fusion protein we made as an ROS reporter (Figure S5J). The
ROS-inducing agent diethyl maleate (DEM), which depletes cells of reduced glutathione,
served as a positive control (Figures S5H and S5J). Additionally, the ROS scavenger
butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), which is structurally unrelated to NAC, blocked the
accumulation of HIF1α caused by the ROS-inducing agent rotenone, but not by L-glutamate
(Figure 5H). Finally, lowering glutathione levels in Hs578T with BSO or DEM did not
induce HIF1α (Figure S5K). Collectively these results implied that HIF1α induction by Lglutamate was not caused by cellular ROS.

Author Manuscript

To study this further, we grew Hs578T cells expressing FLuc driven by the 3xHRE promoter
or a constitutive promoter in opposing mammary fat pads in immunocompromised mice.
Treating such mice with SAS minimally induced the 3xHRE-FLuc signal (data not shown),
possibly because xCT was already inhibited by glutamate. Consistent with this idea, and
consistent with the cell culture results depicted in Figure 5H, the 3xHRE-FLuc signal was
inhibited by NAC, but not BHA (Figure 5I).

2-OG-dependent dioxygenases, such as EglN1, are prone to self-catalyzed inactivation,
thought to reflect oxidation of their ferrous irons or reactive cysteine residues (Flashman et
al., 2010; Hirsila et al., 2005; Myllyla et al., 1978). For this reason, in vitro assays with such
enzymes often contain reducing agents such as ascorbate. We noted that HIF1α induction in
TNBC cells by glutamate was reversed by ascorbate and, to a much lesser extent, ferrous
iron, consistent with glutamate causing EglN oxidation (Figures S6A and S6B). Importantly,
baseline ascorbate levels are higher in Hs578T cells than in hormone-responsive MCF7 cells
(Figures S5C and S6C), indicating that the sensitivity of Hs578T cells to glutamate, relative
to MCF7 cells, is not caused by ascorbate deficiency.

Free Cysteine Maintains EglN1 Activity by Preventing Oxidation of Specific EglN1
Cysteine Residues

In vitro assays done with recombinant EglN1 in the presence of ascorbate were insensitive to
the addition of L-cysteine (Figure 6A). Remarkably, however, ascorbate-free reactions were
stimulated by L-cysteine in the same concentration range as in our cellular studies (Figure
6A). In contrast, L-cysteine could not substitute for ascorbate in collagen 4-prolyl
hydroxylase assays (Figure 6B). These findings suggest that EglN1 senses both oxygen and
free cysteine.

Author Manuscript

EglN1 activity in ascorbate-free reactions was also sustained in the presence of dithiothreitol
(DTT) or high concentrations of reduced glutathione, but not in the presence of BHA, BME
or L-cystine (Figure S6D). The ability of DTT and glutathione to substitute for ascorbate in
such assays has been reported before (Flashman et al., 2010). EglN1 activation by Lcysteine occurred over a wide range of ferrous iron concentrations and in both the presence
and absence of catalase, suggesting that the effects of L-cysteine did not involve altered iron
oxidation or protection from hydrogen peroxide (Figures 6C and S6E). A caveat regarding
the former is that iron is tightly bound by EglN1 and might not rapidly exchange with free
iron in solution. We did not, however, detect a change in the oxidation status of EglN1bound iron by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy under conditions that
promote EglN1 self-inactivation (Figure S6F).

We next asked if EglN1 self-inactivation might reflect oxidation of specific EglN1 cysteine
residues, which would decrease their reactivity with electrophilic probes such as maleimide
and iodoacetamide. In support of this idea, active EglN1 was more readily labeled than selfinactivated EglN1 with PEG-maleimide, as seen by its retarded electrophoretic mobility
(Figure 6D). To map the responsible cysteine residues, we used a quantitative chemical
proteomic method termed isoTOP-ABPP (Weerapana et al., 2010), wherein active and
inactive EglN1 were reacted with an iodoacetamide-alkyne (IA) probe, which was then
conjugated to an isotopically heavy or light, respectively, TEV protease-cleavable biotin tag
using click chemistry (Figure 6E). The two EglN1 samples were then mixed and the labeled
EglN1 was recovered with streptavidin agarose and digested with trypsin. Bound peptides
containing IA-labeled cysteine residues were released using TEV protease and analyzed by
liquid chromatography-MS/MS, using the heavy/light (isoTOP-ABPP) ratio to infer changes
in cysteine reactivity (ratio of ~1 = ~ no change, ratio > 1 = more reactive in active EglN1
than in self-inactivated EglN1). Previous isoTOP-ABPP studies showed that the IA-alkyne
probe, in general, reacts strongly with redox-regulated cysteines in the native human
proteome (Weerapana et al., 2010). We therefore used native EglN1 in our isoTOP-ABPP
experiments in an attempt to minimize denaturation-induced artifactual changes in cysteine
oxidation states. These experiments reproducibly quantified the relative reactivity of 11 of
15 total cysteines in EglN1.
We reproducibly observed increased IA-labeling of specific EglN1 cysteine residues within
the EglN1 catalytic domain (Cys 208, Cys 266, Cys 302, and Cys 323/326; note that
cysteines on the same tryptic peptide cannot be differentiated) in active EglN1 compared to
self-inactivated EglN1, consistent with these residues becoming oxidized during selfinactivation (Figures 6F and 6I). These same residues regained IA-reactivity after

reactivating self-inactivated EglN1 with ascorbate (Figures 6G and 6H). These changes were
specific because multiple other EglN1 cysteine residues (Cys 21/24, Cys 42/43, Cys 127,
and Cys 201) were not differentially labeled comparing active and inactive EglN1 (Figure 6F
and 6H). These results suggest that free cysteine protects EglN1 from reversible autooxidation of specific intramolecular cysteine residues.

Discussion
We discovered that TNBC cells induce HIF in a paracrine fashion by secreting glutamate.
High extracellular glutamate levels inhibit the glutamate-cystine antiporter, xCT, and thereby
interfere with cystine uptake and lower intracellular cysteine levels. Decreased intracellular
cysteine levels inhibit the EglN prolyl hydroxylases and thereby stabilize HIF1α.

Author Manuscript

xCT is required for the secretion of glutamate by TNBC cells and thus appears to play both
an efferent and afferent role in intercellular signaling by glutamate with respect to HIF.
Glutamate secretion by cancer cells via xCT has been reported previously (Seidlitz et al.,
2009; Sharma et al., 2010). HIF induction by glutamate does not exclude other roles of
glutamate secretion in cancer. Glutamate can also alter cancer cell behavior by modulating
ionotropic glutamate receptors, such as the AMPA receptor and NMDA receptors, and
metabotropic glutamate receptors (Stepulak et al., 2014; Willard and Koochekpour, 2013).
Indeed, a role for the NMDA receptor and metabotropic glutamate receptor-1 in breast
cancer has been previously suggested (Mehta et al., 2013; North et al., 2010; Speyer et al.,
2012). Secretion of glutamate by glioblastoma cells promotes invasion and tumorigenesis at
least partly by causing neuroexcitatory death of surrounding normal brain cells and by
activating AMPA receptors (Stepulak et al., 2014; Willard and Koochekpour, 2013).
Glutamate can also, via AMPA and NMDA receptors, promote blood vessel leakiness,
which could facilitate metastasis (Andras et al., 2007). Therefore, glutamate might have
multiple downstream targets in cancer.
Our data suggest that some cancers induce HIF in response to glutamate and others do not.
In this regard, we noted that ER-positive breast cancer lines and HER2-positive breast
cancer lines do not secrete high levels of glutamate and do not increase HIF in response to
exogenous glutamate despite the presence of xCT. This differential sensitivity presumably
reflects, at least in part, differences in intracellular metabolism such as differences in
glutamine uptake (and conversion to glutamate), intracellular cysteine turnover, and basal

TNBCs have particularly high xCT levels relative to other cancers (Timmerman et al., 2013;
Yang and Yee, 2014) and we found that TNBCs with high xCT levels are highly lethal,
conceivably because they can secrete and respond to extracellular glutamate. Clearly it is
dangerous to infer causality from a prognostic biomarker. For example, the association of
xCT with poor clinical outcomes might simply reflect the fact that aggressive tumors
experience redox stress, which can induce NRF2 and hence xCT.
Our work, however, suggests the intriguing possibility that TNBCs with high xCT have a
poor prognosis because they accumulate extracellular glutamate, which inhibits xCT

function and induces HIF. If intratumoral glutamate levels were to fall the inhibition of xCT
would be relieved, leading to more glutamate secretion and reestablishment of the xCTinhibited steady state.

On the other hand pharmacological and shRNA-mediated disruption of xCT function
inhibits many cancers, including TNBC, in preclinical models (Dixon et al., 2012; Lu et al.,
2015; Narang et al., 2003, 2007; Timmerman et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014; Yang and Yee,
2014). Can this be reconciled with our model that inhibition of xCT by glutamate stimulates
tumor growth? We confirmed that loss of xCT causes a modest proliferation defect under
standard culture conditions. Nonetheless, we readily created TNBC cells with undetectable
xCT levels using CRISPR-based gene editing. Of note, these cells remained sensitive to
(S)4-CPG and SAS, suggesting that off-target effects confounded their previously published
anticancer activities. More importantly, glutamate did not inhibit TNBC proliferation at
concentrations that were more than sufficient (up to 25 mM; data not shown) to inhibit xCT
and induce HIF, suggesting there are quantitative or qualitative differences between
inhibiting xCT with glutamate compared to genetically eliminating xCT or inhibiting its
function with drugs such as (S)4-CPG and SAS.

Among the natural amino acids, L-cysteine and L-histidine are uniquely capable of
increasing EglN activity in cells (Lu et al., 2005). L-cysteine can be converted to the
endogenous ROS scavenger, reduced glutathione. We therefore initially hypothesized that
the induction of HIF1α observed after xCT blockade was caused by ROS-mediated EglN
inactivation resulting from glutathione depletion. We did not, however, detect decreased
glutathione (reduced/oxidized) or increased ROS in TNBC cells grown in cystine-free media
or in cells in which xCT was blocked by extracellular glutamate. In addition, we observed
decreased, rather than increased, levels of the ROS-inducible NRF2 transcription factor in
cystine-starved cells. Conversely, NRF2 was induced in cells in which HIF1 was suppressed
by exogenous cystine. Finally, ROS scavengers structurally unrelated to cysteine prevented
HIF induction by ROS, but not by glutamate. These findings strongly suggest that the effects
of cysteine loss on HIF1α in TNBC cells are not caused by decreased glutathione and
increased cellular ROS.

Instead, we found that cysteine directly stimulates recombinant EglN1 in cell-free assays in
the absence of other reducing agents and does so at concentrations that modulate EglN1
activity in cells. This finding is consistent with earlier work in which EglN1 activity assays
were performed with crude cell extracts (Lu et al., 2005). Ascorbate is used to support
EglN1 activity in vitro but is dispensable for EglN1 activity in vivo (Nytko et al., 2011).
While EglN1 acts as a key oxygen sensor, these data indicate that it can also directly sense
intracellular cysteine, and that cysteine is sufficient to protect EglN1 from self-inactivation.
Although both cysteine and histidine can alter iron redox status, we did not detect a change
in EglN1 iron oxidation status in self-inactivated EglN1. Instead, our data suggest that free
cysteine prevents the oxidation of specific cysteine residues within EglN1 that are critical for
its function. There is growing appreciation that oxidative cysteine posttranslational
modifications play important roles in cell signaling (Chung et al., 2013; Green and Paget,

2004; Jacob, 2011). Indeed, cysteine appears to be an evolutionarily ancient sensor of
oxygen and oxidative stress (Green and Paget, 2004; Mecinovic et al., 2009).

Author Manuscript

EglN1 has an N-terminal zinc finger domain with 7 cysteine residues, a catalytic domain
(residues 181–426) with 7 highly conserved cysteines, and an intervening spacer region with
one cysteine. Earlier work showed that cysteine residues 127, 201 and 208 are particularly
prone to oxidation (Chowdhury et al., 2011; Mecinovic et al., 2009; Nytko et al., 2011). We
found that self-inactivation of EglN1 is linked to oxidation of cysteine residues 208, 266,
302, and either 323 or 326 (or both). Of note, it was recently reported that EglN1 cysteine
residues 302 and 326 mediate EglN1 dimer formation when EglN1 is oxidatively inactivated
(Lee et al., 2016). Clearly, additional studies will be required to determine how,
mechanistically, oxidation of the intramolecular cysteine residues identified here regulates
EglN1 activity and to understand why this enzyme evolved to sense both oxygen and
cysteine. It will also be important to ask whether other 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases,
including chromatin regulatory enzymes, share this property.

Identification of L-Glutamate by Fractionation and 1NMR

Author Manuscript

In pilot experiments, the < 3 kDa media fractions from either fresh media or media
conditioned by Hs578T for 72 hours (Hs578T-CCM) were isolated using Ultracel 3K
centrifugal filters (Amicon), loaded onto Sep-Pak 1 g C18 6 cc Vac Cartridges (Waters
WAT036905), and the flow-through collected. The column was eluted with 1 mL dH20,
followed by acetonitrile. The eluates were lyophilized and resuspended in dH20 (flowthrough and dH20 eluate) or DMSO (acetonitrile eluate) to test for activity in the 3xHREFLuc assay.
To isolate and identify the HIF-inducing factor, the fractionation schema used for the pilot
experiments was scaled up proportionally. 30 mL media was loaded onto a 10 g C18-SPE
column and the flow-through collected. The column was then eluted twice with 10 mL
dH2O, once with 1:1 methanol:dH2O and once with methanol. The eluates were collected
and lyophilized, and an aliquot of each was resuspended in water prior to the 3xHRE-FLuc
assay.

Author Manuscript

The active fraction (first dH20 eluate) was separated on a Hypercarb column (250 × 10 mm;
5 µ •; 2 mL/min; with water for 10 minutes, transitioned to 100% methanol in 10 minutes,
and maintained on 100% methanol for an additional 10 minutes) using an Agilent HPLC
instrument. 30 subfractions were collected (one subfraction per minute), lyophilized and
tested in the 3xHRE-FLuc assay.
The 1H NMR spectrum of the active subfractions, collected from a 600 MHz Varian NMR
spectrometer, revealed the presence of inositol, malic acid, lactic acid, serine, DAP, glutamic
acid, lysine, and glycine. These compounds (both enantiomers, when applicable)(Sigma)
were tested in the 3xHRE-FLuc assay.

In Vitro Prolyl Hydroxylation Assays

Author Manuscript

Recombinant EglN1 was produced in H5 insect cells and affinity purified with anti-Flag
affinity column as described earlier (Hirsila et al., 2005). In vitro prolyl hydroxylation
assays were done with 0.5 µM recombinant EglN1 and 0.2 µM L-[2,3,4,5-3H]proline-labeled
HIF1α oxygen-dependent degradation domain (Koivunen et al., 2006) in hydroxylase buffer
containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 60 µg/ml catalase and 5 µM FeSO4 for 30 min at 37°C.
Ascorbate, L-cysteine, L-cystine, GSH, DTT, BHA and BME were added as indicated. 4hydroxy[3H]proline was measured by a specific radiochemical procedure (Juva and Prockop,
1966). Collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase activity was determined with the same procedure
using purified recombinant Col-P4H-I, [14C]proline-labeled type I protocollagen as a
substrate and detecting 4-hydroxy[14C]proline.

Author Manuscript

Reactivation of self-inactivated EglN1 was assessed by measuring the hydroxylationcoupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate in a reaction that contained a synthetic
peptide DLD19 (50 µM), representing the Pro564 hydroxylation site in HIF1α as a substrate
(Hirsila et al., 2005) and 15 µM EglN1 in presence or absence of 0.5 mM ascorbate in
hydroxylase buffer for 30 min at 37°C. Omitting ascorbate resulted in self-inactivation.
Reactivation was induced by adding 0.5 mM ascorbate to the self-inactivated EglN1 and
continuing the incubation for an additional 30 min at 37°C.
In Vitro Iodoacetamide Alkyne Labeling and Enrichment of Recombinant EglN1

Author Manuscript

Recombinant EglN1 (0.7 mg/mL) was used in in vitro prolyl hydroxylation assays either in
the absence of reducing agent (Inactive), or in the presence of 0.5 mM ascorbate or 0.1 mM
L-cysteine (Active). 10 µL of active and inactive EglN1 were labeled separately with 1 mM
iodoacetamide alkyne (1 µL of 10 mM stock in DMSO). After 60 minutes incubation at RT,
90 µL of soluble MDA-MB-231 proteome (1 mg/mL) was added to each sample. Coppermediated azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC or click) chemistry was done for 1h by adding
100 µM heavy-TEV-tag or light-TEV-tag to the active or inactive EglN1 preparations,
respectively (2 µL of a 5 mM stock), 1 mM TCEP (50X solution in water), 100 µM ligand
(17X solution in DMSO:t-butanol 1:4) and 1 mM CuSO4 (50X solution in water). The
labeled samples were then combined, processed and analyzed according the published
isoTOP-ABPP protocol (Weerapana et al., 2007)(Weerapana et al., 2007). Cys 33/36, Cys 58
and Cys 283 could not be detected reproducibly, so they were omitted from the final
analysis.

(D) Immunoblot of self-inactivated or active recombinant EglN1 after covalent attachment
of PEG-maleimide followed by SDS-PAGE. EglN1 activity was maintained using ascorbate.
(E) EglN1 isoTOP-ABPP schematic. Active or inactivated recombinant EglN1 samples are
treated with cysteine-directed iodoacetamide-alkyne probe (IA) (reduced cysteine residues
represented in black, oxidized cysteine residues represented in red). The samples are then
conjugated to isotopically differentiated TEV protease-cleavable biotin tags [light (purple)
and heavy (blue)] by click chemistry and mixed. The IA-labeled proteins are enriched using
streptavidin-conjugated beads, and digested stepwise on-bead with trypsin and TEV to yield
IA-labeled peptides for MS analysis. Competition ratios or R values are measured by
dividing the MS1 ion peaks for IA-labeled peptides in active (ascorbate-treated) (heavy, or
blue) versus inactivated (light, or purple) samples.
(F and H) Iodoacetamide alkyne-labeling of cysteine residues in full-length, recombinant
EglN1. Residues sensitive to ascorbate or exogenous cysteine are indicated by an increase in
the isoTOP-ABPP ratio (red bars). Data are represented as mean ± SEM. * refers to p-value
< 0.05, ** refers to p-value < 0.01, *** refers to p-value < 0.001.
(G) In vitro activity of recombinant EglN1 in the absence of ascorbate (Inactivated), the
presence of ascorbate, or activity of previously inactivated EglN1 following reactivation
with ascorbate (Reactivated Ascorbate). Data shown are represented as mean ± SEM of four
independent experiments. * refers to p-value < 0.05, *** refers to p-value < 0.001.
