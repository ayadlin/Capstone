ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is an intractable disease because patients with ovarian cancer
frequently develop drug resistance after long-term chemotherapy. Despite the
availability of cumulative information on drug-resistant patients, strategies to reverse
drug resistance have still not been established. In this study, we analyzed drug
resistance-associated transcription factors (TFs) in ovarian cancer. Gene expression
profiles of 15 drug-resistant and 11 drug-sensitive patients with ovarian cancer were
compared. Our results showed that TFs TFEB1 and YEATS4 regulated the expression of
downstream target genes. These 2 TFs have already been implicated in tumorigenesis
or metastasis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the involvement
of these TFs in drug resistance of ovarian cancer. Interestingly, 70% knockdown
of each of these TFs with siRNAs resulted in approximately 20%~30% recovery of
drug sensitivity. Further, combination treatment of ovarian cancer cells with TFEB1
and YEATS4 siRNAs resulted in 35% reversal of drug resistance. The effect of these
TFs on chemoresistance seemed to be associated with intrinsic apoptosis-related
pathways, such as p53 activation, and not with the suppression of drug transport.
Thus, we suggest a novel approach to reverse chemoresistance of ovarian cancer by
suppressing TFEB1 and YEATS4.

with an overall 5-year survival rate of 30% [2]. Treatment
of epithelial ovarian cancer involves a combination of
surgery and chemotherapy with taxanes and platinum [3].

cancers in women worldwide because this rapidly

mechanisms. For instance, overexpression of MDR1,
which encodes P-glycoprotein, hampers the retention
of taxanes and other cationic drugs [4, 5]. Further,
cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase directly binds to
anticancer drugs and deactivates them. Alternatively, drug
resistance can also develop after treatment with specific
drugs. Platinum drugs attach to DNA duplexes in the
nucleus of cancer cells and inhibit DNA replication [3, 6].
Platinum resistance is mainly associated with the alteration
of intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Taxanes, such as,
paclitaxel are standard cytotoxic drugs for treating ovarian
cancer. Taxanes target microtubules and block mitosis and
cell proliferation. Taxane resistance occurs because of
genetic or post-translational modifications in microtubule
formation and cell cycle [4]. A study by Sherman-Baust
et al. showed that 845 genes were altered in at least one
drug-resistant phenotype of ovarian cancer [7]. Further,
460, 366, and 337 genes were aberrantly altered in
ovarian cancer cells resistant to cisplatin, doxorubicin,
and paclitaxel, respectively [7]. However, only 62 of
these genes were common among cells resistant to all
the 3 drugs. Because targeting every gene listed above is
practically impossible, it may be efficient to target genes
encoding the most upstream transcription factors (TFs;[7,
8]. Regulation of TFs may provide an economical method
to change cellular physiology with minimum effort [9].
TFs bind to specific DNA sequences and control their
transcription rate [10, 11]. A single TF manages various
downstream target genes. Therefore, modulation of a
single TF may affect the expression of several downstream
genes, indicating that TFs are promising druggable targets
[9]. Understanding the complex network underlying
chemoresistance and determining upstream TFs may
provide strategies to overcome or prevent drug resistance.
This study used algorithm for the reconstruction
of accurate cellular networks (ARACNE) to establish a
network of TFs by using microarray data from tissues of
chemoresistant patients [8]. ARACNE, a newly developed
transcriptome analysis program, analyzes functional
associations between metabolic networks. ARACNE
analyzes the expressions of all genes in patients with a
particular disease and identifies genes associated with the
upregulation or downregulation of specific gene sets, thus
predicting functional relationships among these genes [8].
Transcriptional network isolated from the tissues of
drug-resistant patients suggested that TFEB1 and YEATS4
could be targeted to ameliorate drug resistance. Although
these TFs are implicated in tumorigenesis or metastasis,
their association with drug resistance has not been
investigated thus far. In this study, by using ARACNE we
found that TFEB1 and YEATS4 were the most upstream
TFs that regulated genes implicated in drug resistance
[8, 10, 11]. This result may be used for developing
combination drug therapies or novel drugs to prevent drug
resistance and to treat drug-resistant patients with ovarian
cancer who use long-term chemotherapy.

Prediction of transcriptional network and TFs
involved in the development of chemoresistance
To
understand
chemoresistance-related
transcriptional network in ovarian cancer, gene expression
signatures of tissue samples from 594 patients with ovarian
cancer were obtained from TCGA, and the transcriptional
network was determined using ARACNE (Figure 1A and
Data S1). The previously listed 928 TFs were enriched
in ovarian cancer cells (Figure 1B) [8]. These gene
expression signatures were used to obtain drug resistance
signatures of patients with ovarian cancer. Original
data were rearranged based on tumor recurrence after
chemotherapy [12]. Briefly, to determine the expression
of different genes in drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells,
cDNA was generated from RNA obtained from 11 drugsensitive and 15 drug-resistant patients with ovarian
cancer (Figure 1C and Data S2) [12]. Differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) were determined based on the
difference of > 1.5 folds and significance of > 95% (Figure
1D, middle panel).
Two TFs YEATS4 and TFEB1 were anticipated to
be the common upstream regulators that conferred drug
resistance to ovarian cancer cells. Effect of these TFs on
downstream genes was assessed. It was found that TFEB1
was correlated with the expression of 47 downstream
genes and YEATS4 was linked to the expression of 35
downstream genes. Further, 11 genes were regulated by
both YEATS4 and TFEB1 (Figure 2).

In vitro validation of TFEB1 on reversal effect of
drug resistance
To determine whether suppression of TFEB1
reversed chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells, we
prepared HeyA8-MDR, a paclitaxel-resistant cell line
derived from HeyA8, and A2780-CP, a cisplatin-resistant
cell line derived from A2780. We treated HeyA8-MDR and
A2780-CP cells with TFEB1 siRNA (Figure S1), followed
by treatment with paclitaxel and cisplatin, respectively.
Apoptosis was monitored using the MTT assay. siRNAmediated suppression of TFEB1 in HeyA8-MDR cells
recovered paclitaxel (0.25 and 0.5 µM) sensitivity by
approximately 20% compared with that in control siRNAtreated HeyA8-MDR cells (Figure 3A). Apoptosis was
confirmed using PI staining. TFEB1 siRNA-treated
HeyA8-MDR cells showed increased apoptosis after
paclitaxel treatment compared with control siRNA-treated
HeyA8-MDR cells. However, a difference was observed
between drug-sensitive HeyA8 cells and TFEB1 siRNAtreated HeyA8-MDR cells (Figure 3A and 3B). Reduced
proliferation of TFEB1 siRNA-treated A2780-CP cells

of > 12.5 µM significantly increased the apoptosis of
YEATS4 siRNA-treated A2780-CP cells compared with
that of control siRNA-treated A2780-CP cells (Figure 4D).
HeyA8-MDR and A2780-CP cells were treated with
a combination of TFEB1 and YEATS4 siRNAs. Although
the apoptotic rate of cells treated with the combination of
siRNAs was higher than that of cells treated with control
siRNAs, the increase in the level of apoptosis compared
with that of cells treated with either TFEB1 or YEATS4
siRNA was unclear (Figure S3A and B). Apoptosis of
cells treated with both TFEB1 and YEATS4 siRNAs was
compared with that of cells treated with either TFEB1 or
YEATS4 siRNA. Although the proportion of PI-stained
cells, which indicated dead cells, was slightly higher
among cells treated with both TFEB1 and YEATS4
siRNAs than among cells treated with either TFEB1 or
YEATS4 siRNA, the difference was < 5% and even it is not
statistically significant partially in HeyA8-MDR. TFEB1
and YEATS4 siRNA-treated A2780-CP cells showed
slightly higher apoptosis rate than TFEB1 and YEATS4
siRNA-treated HeyA8-MDR cells (Figure S3C and D).

was measured using MTT assay (Figure 3C). The results
obtained were validated using PI staining. Higher dose of
paclitaxel significantly increased the apoptosis of TFEB1
siRNA-treated A2780-CP cells (Figure 3D). Increase in
the apoptosis of TFEB1 siRNA-treated A2780-CP cells
was lower than that of TFEB1 siRNA-treated HeyA8MDR cells.

In vitro validation of YEATS4 on reversal effect of
drug resistance
Next, we determined whether YEATS4 decreased
drug resistance of ovarian cancer cells by treating
HeyA8-MDR and A2780-CP cells with YEATS4 siRNA.
Efficacy of siRNA treatment was checked (Figure S2).
Treatment with YEATS4 siRNA increased the apoptosis of
HeyA8-MDR cells, with approximately 20% difference
in apoptotic cells between YEATS4 siRNA- and control
siRNA-treated cells (Figure 4A). Treatment with 0.5 µM
paclitaxel decreased MTT percentage (MTT%) of YEATS4
siRNA-treated HeyA8-MDR cells by 50%. This result
was validated using PI staining, with YEATS4 siRNAtreated HeyA8-MDR cells showing increased apoptosis
compared with control cells (Figure 4B). YEATS4 siRNAtreated A2780-CP cells also responded to cisplatin, and
the responsiveness increased with an increase in the dose
of cisplatin from 6.25 to 25 µM (Figure 4C). These results

DISCUSSION

cancers because ovarian cancer cells frequently acquire
drug resistance. Delaying the occurrence of drug resistance
or restoring drug sensitivity may allow effective treatment
of this cancer. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptional
network of ovarian cancer by using a previously published
algorithm. This algorithm predicted TFEB1 and YEATS4
as the most upstream TFs that conferred drug resistance.
To determine the genes altered in ovarian cancer cells,
we obtained gene expression profiles of 594 patients

Studies on the early detection of ovarian cancer
and determination of new therapeutic approaches to
reduce mortality have been largely unsuccessful because
the origin and pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian cancer
are poorly understood [13]. Ovarian cancer can be cured
as long as cancer cells do not acquire drug resistance.
However, ovarian cancer is one of the most incurable

with ovarian cancer from TCGA. Next, we enriched
these genes with other DEGs that were determined using
tissues obtained from drug-sensitive and drug-resistant
patients with ovarian cancer. Thus, there might be a bias
in the initially utilized gene pool. Although we may have
missed other TFs, TFEB1 and YEATS4 are not likely
to be mispredicted as being involved in conferring drug
resistance to ovarian cancer cells.
TFEB1 significantly increases the transcriptional
activation of many lysosome- and autophagy-related
genes. Because autophagy partially results in drug
resistance [14], it can be logically inferred that
suppressing TFEB1 expression can compensate effect
drug resistance. However, isolation of TFEB1 as a
regulator of drug resistance has not been reported thus
far. Especially, limited studies have been performed on
TFEB1 for restoring drug sensitivity. TFEB1 triggers
the overexpression of lysosome-related genes by directly
binding to their promoters [15]. This significantly
increases the biogenesis of lysosomes [16]. TFEB1 plays
an important role in regulating autophagy. Autophagy
allows cells to degrade their own components and to
reuse vital molecules during malnutrition. Deficiency of
endogenous TFEB1 reduces the number of autophagosome
[17]. Thus, autophagy confers drug resistance to cancer
cells by suppressing the action of drugs entering these
cells. Thus, suppression of TFEB1 may decrease the
number of autophagosomes. Further, TFEB1 supports
cell homeostasis. TFEB1 shuttles between the cytoplasm

and lysosomes in well-nourished cells; however, it
is transported from the cytoplasm into the nucleus in
malnourished cells. Thus, TFEB1 controls the number of
lysosomes in the cytoplasm based on the nutrition status
of cells [15, 16].
YEATS4 is essential for cell growth and viability
[18]. YEATS4 has an N-terminal TFIIF domain that is
conserved in all YEATS family proteins [19]. This family
includes proteins such as yeast Yaf9, TAF14, and SAS5
as well as proteins implicated in human cancers [20].
Although YEATS4 is known to suppress p53 activity
in the nucleus [10] and is upregulated in non-small-cell
lung cancer, its involvement in the development of drug
resistance has not been reported to date [20]. Human
YEATS4 is an imperfect TF because it does not contain
DNA-binding sites. Moreover, it is associated with DNA
translocation and shows high relativity with yeast AF-9
and ENL proteins. YEATS4 associates with NuMA,
KIAA1009, and PFDN1 [18]. Combination treatment
with TFEB1 and YEATS4 siRNAs did not increase the
apoptosis of HeyA8-MDR and A2780-CP cells compared
with treatment with individual siRNAs (Figure S3),
indicating that TFEB1 partially overlapped YEATS4
while inducing drug resistance. Because YEATS4 does not
have DNA-binding sites, its transcriptional contribution
to the development of drug resistance may depend on
TFEB1. Further, of the 93 ovarian cancer genes regulated
by TFEB1 and YEATS4, 11 (12%) were commonly
associated by both these TFs (Figure 2). Thus, suppression

of both TFEB1 and YEATS4 by combination treatment
with the respective siRNAs did not provide clear results.
Although knockdown of TFEB1 and YEATS4
increased the expression of p53 compared with its baseline
level, expression of MDR was unchanged (Figure 5). This
result suggested that TFEB1 and YEATS4 were only
slightly involved in the transport of drugs into cells and
were largely involved in potentiating intrinsic apoptosis
pathways upon drug treatment.
Taken together, these results suggested that TFEB1
and YEATS4 were the key TFs that developed drug
resistance. These results may be used to increase the
effectiveness of drugs used for treating ovarian cancer.

Epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines HeyA8,
HeyA8-MDR, A2780, and A2789-CP were provided
by Dr. Anil K. Sood of the MD Anderson Cancer
Center. These cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1649
(Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and
gentamicin (250 ng/mL). HeyA8-MDR cells were
cultured in RPMI-1649 supplemented with 300 ng/mL
paclitaxel to retain their chemoresistance. Paclitaxel,
alsterpaullone, propidium iodide (PI), and Hoechst
33342 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cisplatin
was obtained from LC Laboratories (MA, US), and
siRNAs were purchased from Bioneer Inc. (South
Korea). Sequences TFEB1 and YEATS4 siRNAs
were
5ʹ-GUACCUGUCCGAGACCUAU-3ʹ
and

respectively.
SiRNAs were used at a concentration of 10 µM.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Analysis of transcriptional network

Cell death assay

Transcriptional network of OVC was constructed
using OVC gene expression data (HT_HG-U133A, level
1) of 594 patients that was obtained from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TGCA). Raw CEL files were downloaded
from the TCGA Data Portal (http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/
tcga) and were normalized using MAS5 algorithm (affy
package in R/Bioconductor). Next, ARACNE (http://
wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/califanolab/index.php/Software/
ARACNE) was used to determine interactions between
previously known TFs and other genes in the TCGA OVC
data. We used 928 TF genes that were previously used in a
study by Carro et al [8]. In all, 100 bootstrapped networks
were generated and were merged into a consensus
network by using a consensus voting method based on
statistically significant number of inferred interactions in
bootstrapping steps. This probe-level consensus network
was merged with a gene-level network. The final genelevel OVC transcriptional network included 13,589 genes
(834 TFs) and 179,572 interactions.

Cell
growth
was
measured
using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay (Promega, Ltd.), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded in
96-well plates at a density of siRNA-treated 5 × 103 cells
per well. After treatment with cisplatin or paclitaxel, the
cells were incubated with 5 mg/mL MTT for 4 h. Next,
the medium was removed, and the cells were incubated
with 150 µL solubilization solution and stop solution at
37°C for 4 h. Absorbance of the reaction solution was
measured at 570 nm. Rate of cell growth inhibition was
calculated using the following formula: (1 - absorbance of
experimental group/absorbance of control group) × 100.
Apoptosis was confirmed by double staining the
cells with 10 µM Hoechst 33342 and 1 µM PI for 20 min
at 37°C. After washing twice with serum-free medium, the
cells were photographed under a fluorescence microscope
(Nikon, Japan). PI-stained cells were counted using a
cell counter under the fluorescence microscope at 100×
magnification. Total number of PI-stained cells in 3
representative fields of view per well were quantified
for each treatment group to estimate the percentage
of PI-stained cells out of the total number of Hoechst
33342-stained cells.

Analysis of master regulators
A list of 928 human TF genes used by Carro et al
was obtained [8]. These 928 TFs were mapped against
2155 probe sets of Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0
GeneChip array for obtaining regulon structure from
the transcriptional network for further analysis. Each
target gene of 834 TF regulons was compared with OVC
chemoresistance signature to identify upstream TFs
with specific signatures. Fisher’s exact test for overlaps
between target and signature genes was performed, and
TFs showing statistically significant results (FDR < 0.05)
were selected. These TFs were ranked according to the
number of target genes that were linked with signature
genes in each regulon.
