Abstract

Author Manuscript

The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that functions in sensory and signaling
pathways. Defects in ciliogenesis can lead to a group of genetic syndromes known as
ciliopathies1–3. However, the regulatory mechanisms of primary ciliogenesis in normal and cancer
cells are incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that autophagic degradation of a
ciliopathy protein OFD1 (oral-facial-digital syndrome 1) at centriolar satellites promotes primary
cilium biogenesis. Autophagy is a catabolic pathway in which cytosol, damaged organelles, and
protein aggregates are engulfed in autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for destruction4.
We show that the population of OFD1 at the centriolar satellites is rapidly degraded by autophagy
upon serum starvation. In autophagy-deficient Atg5 or Atg3 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts,

Ofd1 accumulates at centriolar satellites, leading to fewer and shorter primary cilia and a defective
recruitment of BBS4 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4) to cilia. These defects are fully rescued by Ofd1
partial knockdown that reduces the population of Ofd1 at the centriolar satellites. More strikingly,
OFD1 depletion at centriolar satellite promotes cilia formation in both cycling cells and
transformed breast cancer MCF7 cells that normally do not form cilia. This work reveals that
removal of OFD1 by autophagy at centriolar satellites represents a general mechanism to promote
ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. These findings define a newly recognized role of autophagy in
organelle biogenesis.

Author Manuscript

During autophagy, the membrane anchored LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light
chain 3) interacts with cargo and cargo-adaptor proteins, recruiting cargoes to the
autophagosome for subsequent degradation upon fusion of the autophagosome with the
lysosome5–11. We carried out a tandem-affinity purification using tagged LC3 as bait to
search for its interacting proteins (Fig. 1a). In addition to known LC3-interacting proteins
(MAP1B, FYCO1, p62, and Keap112), we identified a set of centriolar satellite proteins,
including PCM1, OFD1 and CEP131, that had not previously been shown to associate with
LC3. PCM1 was also pulled down by LC3 orthologs, GATE16 and GABARAP (Extended
Data Fig. 1a). PCM1, OFD1 and LC3 co-immunoprecipitated with each other, suggesting
that they are in the same complex (Fig. 1b–1d). PCM1 likely enhances the interaction
between LC3 and OFD1, as the OFD1-LC3 interaction is compromised in PCM1-depleted
cells (Fig. 1e, f).

Author Manuscript

Depletion of PCM1 by RNA interference had no significant effect on autophagy activity as
determined by LC3 lipidation and p62 degradation (Extended Data Fig. 1b). We then
examined if any of these centriolar satellite proteins is an autophagy substrate. Ofd1 protein
levels were reduced by serum starvation and this reduction was compromised in autophagydeficient Atg5−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) compared to Atg5+/+ MEFs,
whereas PCM1, IFT88 and BBS4 protein levels were not altered by serum starvation or in
Atg5−/− MEFs (Fig. 1g). The messenger RNA levels of Ofd1 were not significantly changed
upon serum starvation in Atg5+/+ and Atg5−/− MEFs (Extended Data Fig. 1c), suggesting
that Ofd1 protein level reduction upon serum starvation is through protein degradation rather
than transcriptional downregulation. Blocking autophagic flux by lysosomal inhibitors
bafilomycin A1 (Baf) or chloroquine (CQ) resulted in increased Ofd1 accumulation upon
serum starvation (Fig. 1h). Taken together, these data suggest that Ofd1 is degraded via the
autophagy-lysosome pathway upon serum starvation.

OFD1 is the gene underlying the human disease oral-facial-digital syndrome type 1 (OFD1),
an X-linked ciliopathy characterized by morphological abnormalities and renal cysts, as well
as Joubert syndrome and Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 213–18. OFD1 localizes to
the distal ends of centrioles and is necessary for distal appendage formation, IFT88
recruitment, and primary cilium formation18,19. OFD1 also localizes to centriolar satellites,
interacting with proteins associated with human ciliary disease, PCM1, Cep290, BBS420.
However, the function of this OFD1 population remains unclear.
The centriolar satellite localization of OFD1 is determined by PCM1, since OFD1 was lost
from satellites when PCM1 was depleted (Extended Data Fig. 2a, b). LC3 partially

colocalized with PCM1 upon serum starvation in a majority of retinal pigment epithelial
(RPE) cells, but rarely in unstressed cells (Extended Data Fig. 2c, d). LC3 also partially
colocalized with endogenous OFD1 when lysosome activity is blocked by Baf or CQ
treatment (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). This colocalization was limited to the centriolar
satellites, as LC3 did not colocalize with the centriole marker γ-tubulin (Extended Data Fig.
3c, d).

OFD1 was present at both the centrioles and the centriolar satellites in untreated RPE cells.
Remarkably, the centriolar satellite pool of OFD1 was dramatically reduced upon serum
starvation, while the population of OFD1 at the centrioles remained unchanged (Fig. 2a).
This serum starvation- induced OFD1 degradation from centriolar satellites was blocked in
Atg5+/+ MEFs treated with the lysosome inhibitor CQ (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). Notably,
PCM1 protein levels are not controlled by autophagy and the centriolar satellite distribution
of PCM1 is not altered upon serum starvation (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 4c–e), suggesting
that the autophagic degradation is specific to OFD1 at centriolar satellites rather than
centriolar satellites as a whole. This notion is further supported by our observation that Ofd1
remained at centriolar satellites upon serum starvation in Atg5−/− MEFs but was lost from
centriolar satellites in Atg5+/+ MEFs (Fig. 2b).

Author Manuscript

The loss of Ofd1 from centriolar satellites was significantly faster than the loss of Ofd1 from
centrioles, and the rate of loss of Ofd1 in Atg5−/− MEFs was slower than that in Atg5+/+
MEFs (Extended Data Fig. 5a). The centriolar satellite pool of Ofd1 in Atg5+/+ cells was
lost within six hours of serum starvation, whereas this pool of Ofd1 in Atg5−/− cells
remained stable even after twenty-four hours of serum starvation (Extended Data Fig. 5b).
These data confirm that Ofd1 at centriolar satellites has a faster turnover rate than Ofd1 at
centrioles, and this serum starvation induced accelerated degradation is controlled by
autophagy.
We next sought to understand how OFD1 regulation might affect ciliogenesis. We observed
that the percentage of Atg5−/− cells that form a primary cilium, as compared to Atg5+/+
cells, was significantly reduced and the cilia that did form were shorter (Fig. 3a). This
difference was not due to cell cycle regulation (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Lysosome inhibition
also compromised primary ciliogenesis in Atg5+/+ MEFs (Extended Data Fig. 6b–d). The
defective ciliogenesis phenotypes were not limited to Atg5−/− MEFs, as similar phenotypes
were also observed in MEFs lacking another essential autophagy gene, Atg3 (Extended Data
Fig. 6e–g).

We next investigated if the ciliary recruitment of BBS4, a critical event for ciliogenesis19,21,
is affected in autophagy-deficient cells. We observed that BBS4 accumulated at centriolar
satellites in Atg5−/− MEFs; more than 50% of cilia had detectable BBS4 in Atg5+/+ MEFs,
whereas only about 10% of cilia were positive for BBS4 in Atg5−/− MEFs (Extended Data
Fig. 7). These data indicate that BBS4 recruitment to cilia is also defective in autophagy
deficient cells.
If Ofd1 accumulation at centriolar satellites is responsible for the ciliary defects in Atg5−/−
MEFs, we would expect that depletion of Ofd1 by RNA interference might rescue these

defects. In Atg5−/− MEFs stably expressing Ofd1 shRNA, with about 50% efficiency of
overall depletion of Ofd1 (Extended Data Fig. 8a), Ofd1 remained at centrioles but was lost
from centriolar satellites (Extended Data Fig. 8b–d). Primary cilium formation upon serum
starvation was fully restored in these cells; nearly 70% of cells formed a cilium and the
length of these cilia was comparable to those formed in Atg5+/+ MEFs (Fig. 3b). Hence, the
centriolar satellite pool of Ofd1 indeed plays a key role in suppressing primary ciliogenesis
in Atg5−/− MEFs. Strikingly, with Ofd1 knockdown, nearly 35% of the Atg5−/− cells
formed cilia even without serum starvation (Fig. 3b), suggesting that Ofd1 degradation is
likely required for serum starvation-induced primary ciliogenesis. This notion is supported
by the observation that primary cilia formed efficiently even in the cycling Atg5+/+ MEFs
depleted of Ofd1 without serum starvation (Extended Data Fig. 9a). The presence of cilia in
MEFs was further confirmed by the positive staining of the cilium marker Arl13b (Extended
Data Fig. 9b), which specifically decorates the ciliary membrane22.

Primary cilia are formed in normal breast epithelial cells but not detected in breast cancer
cell lines such as MCF723. Restoration of primary cilia in human cancer cells might be
beneficial to reduce malignancy, since cilia are required for proper functions of several
signaling pathways (hedgehog etc.) that play crucial roles in many types of cancers24. We
further tested if OFD1 reduction could restore primary ciliogenesis in MCF7 cells. We
generated an OFD1 stable knockdown clone (C19) in MCF7 cells, which exhibited 44%
ODF1 depletion efficiency (Fig. 4a). Similar to OFD1 knockdown MEFs, the centriolar
satellite population of OFD1 in C19 cells was dramatically reduced, while the centriole pool
remained stable (Extended Data Fig. 10a–c). Remarkably, primary cilia formed in about
20% C19 cells upon serum starvation, but were completely absent in parental MCF7 cells
(Fig. 4b, c). The length of these cilia ranged from 2 μm to 6 μm (Fig. 4d). As expected for
normal primary cilia, these cilia extended from basal bodies and were positive for Arl13b,
acetylated-tubulin, and the intraflagellar transport protein IFT88 (Fig. 4e, Extended Data
Fig. 10d–f). Finally these cilia could be directly visualized under the scanning electron
microscope (Fig. 4f). Thus, by manipulating the expression of one protein, OFD1, it is
possible to reverse the cilia-defective phenotype of a transformed breast cancer cell line.
Primary ciliogenesis remains inefficient in C19 cells, suggesting that addition factors are
required to reach full capacity. Nevertheless, these data confirm that OFD1 at the centriolar
satellite functions as a crucial suppressor of primary ciliogenesis in human cancer cells.

We show here that autophagy is linked to primary ciliogenesis, by controlling the
degradation of OFD1 at centriolar satellites. We propose that autophagy deficiency serves as
a potential underlying mechanism of ciliopathies, and that autophagy modulation might
provide a novel means of ciliopathy treatment. We demonstrate that OFD1 at centriolar
satellites plays a crucial role in suppressing primary ciliogenesis, which is different from
OFD1 at centrioles that has been shown to be essential for ciliogenesis. Removing OFD1
from centriolar satellites promotes ciliogenesis in autophagy-deficient cells, wild-type MEFs
without serum starvation, and human breast cancer MCF7 cells that normally completely
lack cilia, suggesting a general role of OFD1 in suppressing ciliogenesis. Primary
ciliogenesis is defective in human breast and pancreatic cancer cells, but activated in the
corresponding normal tissues/cells23,25. The contribution of primary cilium function to

tumorigenesis is complex26,27, however our results suggest that dissecting the regulatory
mechanisms of OFD1 will provide insight into these functions and potentially offer new
therapeutic tools for treatment of ciliopathies and cancers.

Primary Cilia biogenesis assay

Author Manuscript

Equal numbers (3×105 for serum rich medium and 4.5×105 for serum starved medium) of
Atg5+/+ MEFS and Atg5−/− MEFs were seeded into 6-well dishes. After cells were attached
on the coverslips for 8 hours, they were incubated in either fresh regular medium (10% FBS,
1% P/S DMEM) or serum starved medium (0.5% FBS, 1% P/S DMEM) for 24 hours. Cells
were seeded at different numbers at beginning to ensure that these cells reach the same
confluence one day after treatment. Cells were then fixed for immunofluorescence staining.
For western blotting, cells cultured in 10 cm dishes were serum starved alone or in
combination with 50 nM bafilomycin A1, 20 μM chloroquine or 1 μM MG132 treatment for
24 hours and lysed with TAP buffer.
Immunofluorescence Staining

Author Manuscript

Cells were treated according to the protocol described above with or without serum
starvation or compound treatment. Cells were fixed with cold methanol for five minutes at
−20°C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and then blocked with blocking buffer
(2.5% BSA + 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) at room temperature for one hour. Cells were
incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight, washed five times with PBS buffer and
then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa 488- Alexa 549
(Molecular Probes) for two hours at room temperature. DNA was stained with DAPI. Slides
were examined using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 META UV/
Vis).
Autophagy Analysis

Author Manuscript

Autophagy was induced by serum starvation or rapamycin treatment, or blocked by
lysosome inhibitors, chloroquine or bafilomycin A1. For rapamycin (LC Laboratories)
treatment, cells were incubated with 500nM rapamycin in complete medium for 16 hours at
37°C. To block autophagy flux, 50 nM Bafilomycin A1 (LC Laboratories) or 20 μM
chloroquine (Sigma) was added to complete medium or serum starvation medium and
incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Autophagy activity was assessed using two approaches, LC3-II
formation and p62 degradation. For LC3-II and p62 detection, cell lysates were prepared as
described above and subjected to standard western blotting protocols using 1:10,000 dilution
of the antibody against LC3 (Sigma) and 1:1,000 dilution of the antibody against p62
(MBL).

1×106 cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes, washed once with PBS, and pellets
were resuspended in 1 ml PBS and fixed overnight in 75% ethanol at −20°C. Fixed cells
were washed three times with 10 ml PBS, resuspended in 200–400 μl PBS with 10 μl
RNAase (Qiagen) at 37°C for 30 minutes in the dark. Cells were subjected to FACS analysis
using DAKO-Cytomation MoFlo High Speed Sorter at the Flow Cytometry Facility at UC
Berkeley.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot

Author Manuscript

Transfected cells were lysed in TAP lysis buffer on ice for 30 minutes, and centrifuged at
13,000 g for 15 minutes. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with primary
antibody overnight at 4°C, and then incubated with IgG beads for 2 hours at 4°C. The beads
were washed 5 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Coimmunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes
(Bio-Rad), and detected with antigen-specific primary antibodies followed by HRPconjugated secondary antibodies.
Tandem Affinity Purification of LC3 Complexes

Author Manuscript

This protocol is adapted from what was described before12,28,29. Stable cell lines expressing
ZZ-Flag-LC3, ZZ-Flag-Gate16, or ZZ-Flag-GABARAP, upon doxycycline induction were
treated with 10 ng/ml DOX for one day. The collected cell pellet was washed with chilled
PBS three times and suspended in TAP lysis buffer. Resuspended cell pellets were incubated
on ice for 30 minutes and then gently vortexed for one minute. Homogenates were
centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 g. The supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes
containing 0.8 ml of packed IgG beads followed by gentle rotation overnight at 4°C. Bound
protein was eluted using TEV protease cleavage and further purified by Anti-Flag M2
Affinity Gel (Sigma). Bound protein was eluted using Flag peptide and resolved using SDSPAGE on a 4–12% gradient gel (Invitrogen) and visualized by silver staining (Invitrogen).
Distinct bands were cut and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis.
Quantitative RT–PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNAs were extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), from which 1 μg was used for
reverse transcription in a 20-μL reaction system with the RNA PCR (AMV) kit (Promega).
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with SYBR-Green PCR Mastermix (Applied
Biosystems), and amplification was real-time monitored on a MicorAmp optical 96-Well
Reaction Plate (Applied Biosystems). The level of transcript abundance relative to reference
gene (termed ΔCT) was determined according to the function ΔCT = CT (test gene) − CT
(reference gene). To compare untreated and treated expression levels, the function ΔΔCT
was first determined using the equation ΔΔ CT = Δ CT (treatment) − Δ CT (control) where
control represented mock-treated cells. The induction ratio of treatment/control was then
calculated by the equation 2−ΔΔ CT. Gene expression levels were normalized with the
Atg5+/+ untreated sample.
