BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess which quality-of-life (QOL) line items on the
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) were associated with low QOL in women who
were receiving chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. METHODS: Patients with stage III or IV ovarian cancer on
Gynecologic Oncology Group Protocols 152 and 172 who underwent primary surgery followed by intravenous paclitaxel and cisplatin completed the FACT-O. The FACT scale includes the 4 domains of physical,
functional, social, and emotional well being (PWB, FWB, SWB, EWB, respectively). Women who had overall
FACT-O scores in the lowest quartile (Q1) were compared with women in the upper 3 quartiles (Q2-Q4).
The proportions of women in each group that selected the 2 worst categories for each item were compared. The level of significance was set at P < .005. RESULTS: Before Cycle 4, 361 patients (86.4%) provided valid QOL assessments. For PWB, a significantly greater proportion of women in Q1 versus Q2
through Q4 selected the 2 worst categories of several physical symptoms (nausea, pain, feeling ill, and
being bothered by the side effects of treatment). For FWB, significant differences included being able

to work, being content with the quality of their life, and sleeping well. For EWB, there were significant differences in feeling nervous and worrying about dying. There were virtually no differences between groups
in SWB. Low interest in sex was reported by 56% to 88% of all patients (Q1-Q4). CONCLUSIONS: A large
proportion of women with FACT-O scores in the lowest quartile reported problems that potentially were
amenable to clinical interventions, such as symptom management and psychosocial support.

Quality -of-life (QOL) assessments are a key factor in
assessing cancer burden and the effect of treatment. In a
single-institution study, QOL was measured in patients
with ovarian cancer during adjuvant chemotherapy.1
Mean scores of physical well being (PWB) and fatigue
were significantly lower postoperatively and during adjuvant therapy but improved to preoperative levels after
chemotherapy. Mean functional well being (FWB) subscale scores, however, increased above preoperative levels
after chemotherapy. Emotional well being (EWB) and
social well being (SWB) subscale scores did not change.
Wenzel et al reported significant decreases in total QOL
scores measured during chemotherapy, primarily because
of changes in PWB and FWB.2 From these studies,1,2 it
appears that overall QOL is decreased in patients with
ovarian cancer during chemotherapy, especially in the
physical domain.
Average QOL assessment scores do not provide
information on which specific items within a domain
may be compromised. Within the PWB domain, fatigue, nausea, pain, side effects of treatment, malaise,
and ability to meet family needs are the individual
items. To our knowledge, the degree to which individual items contribute to the overall Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) score has not been
studied in the cancer population. This has practical
and clinical importance, because some of these items
indicate symptoms or problems that may be treated. If
impairment in total QOL is primarily because of decrements in specific items, then treatment of these items
is likely to improve QOL.3-8 Reductions in distress
and improvements in overall QOL also may influence
treatment outcomes, including survival.2 Wenzel et al2
observed that baseline QOL was predictive of survival
in patients with ovarian cancer, and that observation

4858

was attributed primarily to patients in the lowest scoring quartile.
The primary objective of the current study was to
assess which items are associated with lower total FACTOvarian (FACT-O) scores obtained during chemotherapy
by comparing domain item responses from patients in the
lowest quartile with those in the upper 3 quartiles. Previous work has demonstrated that women who have overall
QOL scores in the lowest quartile may differ significantly
from women who have overall scores in the upper quartiles,2 and examining women in the lowest quartile also
may increase the clinical relevance of the data. Because the
inclusion of QOL scores is becoming accepted practice in
outcome assessment,9 appreciation of the range of scores
typical for a given disease also has increased along with the
ability to anticipate when women are likely to be in the
lowest quartile of normative scores for that condition.
Our primary hypothesis was that women whose overall
QOL was in the lowest quartile would indicate specific
items that were significantly more problematic for them
than women whose overall QOL was in the upper 3 quartiles. The null hypothesis was that women in the lowest
quartile would have a generalized depression of scores and
that they would not tend to identify specific items that
were significantly worse for them.
QOL data during chemotherapy were available
from 2 national Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)
studies (GOG 152 and GOG 172), both of which
included intravenous chemotherapy study arms. GOG
152 enrolled women who underwent suboptimal debulking, whereas GOG 172 enrolled women who underwent
optimal debulking. Although the long-term prognosis for
the 2 groups differed, they had both received the same
treatment at the time of the current assessment. Including
both of these protocols in our analysis provided an

opportunity to examine whether debulking status influenced the domain items with decreased scores and
increased the generalizability of the data. Specifically, we
expected that debulking status would not affect the majority of the items within the QOL domain; rather, we
expected that the primary hypothesis would be confirmed
in both groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Data for this analysis were obtained from patients enrolled
on the control arms of 2 randomized ovarian cancer protocols. All patients who were enrolled in GOG 1522 and
GOG 1729 who were randomized to the 6-cycle intravenous paclitaxel and cisplatin control arms were included
(identical dosing). GOG 152 measured QOL in a
randomized trial of interval secondary cytoreduction in
women with advanced ovarian carcinoma who underwent
suboptimal debulking. GOG 172 measured QOL in a
randomized study of intravenous paclitaxel and cisplatin
versus intravenous paclitaxel, intraperitoneal cisplatin,
and intraperitoneal paclitaxel in women who underwent
optimal debulking with stage III epithelial ovarian cancer.
GOG 152 enrolled 208 patients who did not undergo
interval cytoreduction, and GOG 172 included 210
patients entered in the intravenous cisplatin and paclitaxel
arm. Patients who received intraperitoneal therapy on
GOG 172 and patients who underwent secondary
debulking surgery on GOG 152 were not included in the
current analysis. Participating institutions obtained institutional review board approval of the protocols before
enrolling any patients; all patients provided written
informed consent consistent with all federal, state, and
local requirements before they received any protocol therapy. Treatment information and outcome data have been
reported previously.10,11

Methods
For the current report, the baseline QOL measure in
GOG 152 (before chemotherapy Cycle 4) and the second
QOL measurement from GOG 172 (before chemotherapy Cycle 4) were analyzed. The QOL measure chosen
(before chemotherapy Cycle 4 and after Cycle 3) was used
Cancer

October 15, 2009

to provide an assessment of QOL during mid-treatment
chemotherapy after several cycles already had been
administered.
QOL was measured with the FACT-O questionnaire, which includes the FACT-General (FACT-G)
along with 12 additional questions specific to patients
with ovarian cancer. The FACT-G, version 4, is a 27-item
core questionnaire that evaluates the domains of PWB,
FWB, SWB, and EWB.12 Questions are answered on a
5-point Likert scale (0 indicates not at all; 1, a little bit;
2, somewhat; 3, quite a bit; and 4, very much) and a subscale (with Ni items) score (Si) was computed as follow
when 50% or more of the items had been answered:
P
ðdij  Sij Þ
S i ¼ Ni  P
ðdij Þ

in which dij is equal to 1 when the jth item has a valid
response; otherwise, it is equal to 0, and Sij is the score
of the jth item. The FACT-O score is the sum of the
5 subscale scores (FWB, EWB, SWB, PWB, and the
ovarian-specific subscale) and is considered valid only
when >80% of the items are complete. Scores on the
FACT-O range from 0 to 156, and higher FACT-O
scores are associated with better QOL. Reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of the FACT-G have been
demonstrated in a variety of settings, and relative scores
can be compared with normative data.13 Basen-Engquist
et al demonstrated the reliability and validity of the
FACT-O instrument in ovarian cancer patients with
internal consistency reliability for the subscales ranging
from 0.74 to 0.92 and test-retest reliability ranging from
0.72 to 0.88.14 The EWB score in GOG 152 only
included 5 items, and this domain score was prorated by
assuming that the sixth item was missing.15
Total FACT-O scores for all patients were calculated. Patients were divided into quartiles according to
their total FACT-O score (Q1-Q4). Women in the lowest
quartile (Q1) were compared with women in the upper
3 quartiles (Q2-Q4). This comparison was chosen to
expand upon the observation of Wenzel et al that baseline
QOL was predictive for survival and was primarily attributed to the lowest scoring quartile.2 Patient demographic
and clinical characteristics (age, race, ethnicity, stage,
and performance status) between patients in Q1 versus
patients in Q2, Q3, and Q4 were compared by using the

Student t test or the chi-square test of proportions. Performance status is a scale used to assess how a patient’s disease affects the daily living ability of the patient (0
indicates fully active; 1, restricted in physically strenuous
activity; 2, ambulatory and capable of all self-care but
unable to perform work activities; and 3, capable of limited self-care).16 Performance status was available at different time points for the 2 studies; before Cycle 1 (at
baseline) for patients on GOG 172 and before Cycle 4 for
GOG 152.
Each of the 39 items that made up the FACT-O
scale were examined for patients in Q1 versus patients in
Q2, Q3, and Q4. Comparisons were done separately for
GOG 152 and GOG 172 studies, because the 2 protocols
differed in terms of debulking status. The proportions of
women who selected the 2 worst response categories for
each item were compared between the 2 groups (Q1 vs
Q2-Q4). It is noteworthy that item response sets varied
(eg, ‘‘I am able to work’’ or ‘‘I have a lack of energy’’);
thus, the 2 worst categories represented ‘‘not at all’’ and ‘‘a
little bit’’ for the positive items and represented ‘‘very
4860

much’’ and ‘‘quite a bit’’ for the negative items. Comparisons were made using the chi-square test of proportions,
and only P values <.005 were considered statistically significant because of the number of comparisons made.

RESULTS
There were 208 eligible women who underwent suboptimal debulking and were enrolled for 6 cycles of cisplatin
and paclitaxel without interval debulking in GOG 152
from June 6, 1994 to January 29, 2001. There were 210
eligible women who underwent optimal debulking and
were enrolled for 6 cycles of intravenous cisplatin and
paclitaxel in GOG 172 from March 23, 1998 to January
29, 2001. Before Cycle 4, 189 patients (91%) in GOG
152 and 172 patients (82%) in GOG 172 provided valid
QOL assessments for all subscales of the FACT-O.
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients
on GOG 152 and GOG 172 were similar (Table 1). The
mean age of patients was 57 years, the majority were nonHispanic Caucasian, nearly all had stage III disease, and
Cancer

nearly all had a performance status of 0 or 1. Women were
categorized according to either the FACT-O Q1 or the
FACT-O >Q1. Patients who had FACT-O scores in Q1
did not differ significantly from patients in Q2, Q3, and
Q4 for both protocols with regard to patient characteristics (data not shown).
When dividing patients in to quartiles based on
QOL responses, patients in the lowest quartile (Q1) of the
FACT-O had total QOL scores that were 106.1 in
women with suboptimally debulked disease (GOG 152)
and 102.4 in women with optimally debulked disease
(GOG 172) (Table 2). In the PWB domain, a significantly higher proportion of women selected the 2 worst
categories of several physical symptoms (nausea, pain,
feeling ill, and being bothered by the side effects of treatment) as well as more general effects (lack of energy, meeting needs of family, forced to spend time in bed) (Table
2). In the FWB domain, a significantly higher proportion
of women in Q1 selected the 2 worst categories of being
able to work, finding work fulfilling, being able to enjoy
things, and being content with the quality of their life. A
significantly higher proportion selected the worst categories of sleeping well. In the EWB domain, a significantly
higher proportion of women in Q1 reported feeling nervous, sad, and worrying about dying versus women in Q2,
Q3, and Q4 on both protocols. In the SWB domain, significant differences between patients in Q1 versus patients
in Q2, Q3, and Q4 were feeling close to friends for
patients on GOG 152 and were satisfied with their sex life
for both protocols. Over half of the patients in Q1 on
GOG 152 and GOG 172 chose the lowest categories of
being satisfied with their sex life (SWB). Fifty percent to
75% of all patients (Q1-Q4) in both protocols chose the
lowest categories of being interested in sex (FACT-O
items). The FACT-O items that differed significantly
between women in Q1 versus women in Q2, Q3, and Q4
on both protocols were: have a good appetite, like the
appearance of my body, and able to feel like a woman.
Comparisons between women in Q1 of GOG 152
and Q1 of GOG 172 demonstrated that a nonsignificantly higher proportion of patients in Q1 of GOG 152
(suboptimally debulked) selected the worst categories of
feeling nervous than patients in Q1 from GOG 172 (optimally debulked; 45% vs 23%; P ¼ .017). No significant
differences in domains or items between Q1 of GOG 152
and Q1 of GOG 172 were observed.

DISCUSSION
For women who had total QOL scores in the lowest quartile (Q1), the current results demonstrated that the
decreases were because of sizeable differences in specific
concerns, including pain, nausea, feeling ill, and being
bothered by the side effects of treatment. These data are
significant, in that several of these items may be amenable
to interventions that consequently may increase other
aspects of PWB, such as having more energy and being
able to meet the needs of family. Future research also
should examine whether interventions that ameliorate
pain, nausea, feeling ill, and being bothered by side effects
of treatment improve FWB. The finding that there were
virtually no differences in SWB between these subgroups
of women supports the primary hypothesis that impairments in QOL are specific to the disease and treatment
and do not reflect a generalized impairment of QOL. Relatively minor interventions that improve physical symptoms may have large effects by improving other aspects of
PWB and FWB.
In the current study, anxiety appeared to be more
problematic than depression in women with ovarian cancer. A higher proportion of women who underwent suboptimal debulking selected the worst categories of feeling
nervous (EWB) relative to women who underwent optimal debulking (45% vs 23%). Other studies also reported
a higher incidence of anxiety over depression in patients
with ovarian cancer.17 However, the baseline QOL measure in the suboptimal group was obtained before randomization to possible further surgery. Therefore, the
increased anxiety may have been because patients were
aware of their suboptimal tumor status or were waiting for
randomization. Nevertheless, it appears that suboptimal
debulking is a burden not only on overall survival but also
on EWB in patients with ovarian cancer. Although many
of the disruptions in QOL appeared to be caused by the
effects of chemotherapy, specific characteristics of the disease (such as prognosis) may affect overall QOL during
treatment. Again, these data are significant, in that they
identify potential areas of intervention (such as counseling) to alleviate some of these feelings and concerns, especially among women who undergo suboptimal debulking.
Fatigue compromises QOL in patients with cancer.
Medical conditions and treatments sometimes contribute
to fatigue, including anemia, radiation, chemotherapy,

and medication. In addition, other symptoms, including
insomnia, pain, and depression, also may compound
fatigue.18 Physicians should screen for fatigue on a regular
basis and should search for and treat secondary causes.
Evidenced-based recommendations for fatigue remain
elusive, because exercise, energy conservation, counseling,
and pharmacotherapy are not strongly supportive.19
Sexual problems are prevalent among patients with
ovarian cancer. Carmack Taylor et al assessed sexual function in women with ovarian cancer who were receiving
treatment, off treatment with disease, and without evidence of disease.20 Their study revealed that the women
who were receiving chemotherapy had the lowest sexual
activity. Liavaag et al conducted a cross-sectional study
and reported a lower level of sexual activity in women
who had ovarian cancer compared with age-matched controls from the general population.17 Therefore, both studies support the finding that sexual changes appear to be
related to active chemotherapy. The latter study also indicated that sexually active patients reported significant
alterations in pleasure and discomfort.17 The current
study demonstrated that, regardless of whether sexual
activity was being assessed in terms of satisfaction (SWB)
or interest (FACT-O items), the majority of patients were
having difficulty in this area.
Research limitations of this study include an ancillary analysis of previously collected data with limited
patient demographics. Variables such as education and
socioeconomic status were not collected and may be
important variables when comparing QOL. In addition,
GOG 152 and GOG 172 used intravenous cisplatin and
paclitaxel chemotherapy, whereas combined carboplatin
and paclitaxel is currently the preferred regimen. It has
been demonstrated that cisplatin has more toxicity than
carboplatin. It is possible that line items identified with
lower QOL would differ in patients who received carboplatin and paclitaxel compared with the items that were
identified in this study.
Women with a low QOL should be evaluated to
determine whether clinical interventions are appropriate.
Further impetus for the evaluation of these women is that
QOL at baseline is predictive of survival in patients with
ovarian cancer, suggesting that these impairments not
only may be disruptive of QOL but also may have serious
long-term consequences.21 We hypothesize that, by targeting and improving specific QOL areas, there could be

global improvements that have the potential to improve
overall survivorship.
