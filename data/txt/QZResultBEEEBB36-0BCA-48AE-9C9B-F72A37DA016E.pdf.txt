BACKGROUND. In elderly patients with early breast cancer and a clinically clear
axilla, axillary surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and postoperative radiotherapy to the residual breast may not be necessary because of reduced life expectancy, effectiveness of hormone therapy in achieving long-term disease control,
and generally favorable biologic behavior of breast cancer in elderly patients.

METHODS. The authors followed 354 prospectively recruited women aged 70
years who had primary, operable breast cancer and no palpable axillary lymph
nodes. All 354 women were treated with conservative surgery and adjuvant tamoxifen and without axillary dissection or postoperative radiotherapy. Women

reast cancer is the most common malignancy in women, and its
incidence increases with age. Greater than 33% of all breast
cancers in Western countries occur in women aged 70 years.1,2
The best primary treatment for elderly patients with breast cancer is
surgery. Randomized clinical trials comparing surgery with tamoxifen showed that tamoxifen alone failed to control the disease in
most patients, and a high proportion required surgery after they
developed local disease progression.3–6
However, axillary dissection no longer is a routine part of the
surgical treatment of breast cancer. Axillary surgery produces more
morbidity than breast surgery, yet fewer and fewer patients are identified with axillary lymph node involvement on dissection, because
breast cancer is diagnosed at an earlier stage than in the past as a

result of widespread mammographic screening.7 The
minimally invasive technique of sentinel lymph node
biopsy is increasingly used to stage the axilla in
patients with no clinically evident axillary involvement, and axillary dissection is performed only if the
sentinel lymph node is metastatic.8–11
In the elderly, the need for axillary intervention—either dissection or sentinel lymph node
biopsy—is questionable. After tumor resection, hormone therapy is effective in controlling axillary and
distant metastases for long periods,3 and most
elderly patients are likely to die of competing events
rather than from breast cancer. Our own randomized
trial, which was published in 2005, showed that axillary surgery may be safely omitted in older patients
with T1/lymph node negative (T1N0) breast cancer
without affecting breast cancer mortality or overall
survival.12
With regard to adjuvant radiotherapy—which,
generally, is considered essential for preventing
locoregional recurrence in patients who undergo
breast-conserving surgery13–16—other studies17–19
have shown that the locoregional recurrence rate after conservative surgery declines markedly with
increasing age, suggesting that radiotherapy is not
necessary in elderly patients with early breast
cancer.
In previous articles,20,21 we reported outcomes
after treatment of prospectively recruited elderly
patients with breast cancer who underwent conservative surgery without axillary clearance and without
postoperative radiotherapy. In particular, long-term
follow-up (median, 67 months) of patients of ages 70
years to 92 years21 indicated that conservative surgery with tamoxifen is adequate and effective therapeutic treatment. In this report, we present 15-year
follow-up results from the same cohort.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
For this study, 354 consecutive women (slightly
more than the original cohort)21 with a median age
of 77 years (interquartile range, 74–81 years) were
recruited prospectively. All women had operable, primary breast cancer (confirmed either as pathologic
T1 [pT1] or pT2 tumors that measured 3 cm or as
pT4b tumors that measured 2.5 cm) and clinically
negative axillary lymph nodes and were treated at
the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan between 1987
and 1992.
Patients with resection margins in tumor tissue
were excluded, because they were candidates for reexcision or radiotherapy. Patients with synchronous,
bilateral breast carcinoma; distant metastasis at diag-

nosis; or a previous malignancy at another site were
also excluded. Over the study period, 1451 patients
aged 70 years of age presented at our institute;
54% were ineligible for the reasons described above,
leaving 671 potentially eligible patients; of these,
172 patients underwent axillary dissection (with or
without radiotherapy), and 145 patients without axillary dissection received postoperative radiotherapy.
These treatments were given because of patient
choice or the decision of clinicians who were not
involved in the study. All recruited patients underwent breast-conserving surgery (quadrantectomy)
without axillary dissection and without postoperative
radiotherapy. Irrespective of hormone receptor status, after surgery all patients were prescribed 20 mg/
day tamoxifen indefinitely.
Hormone receptor status was determined by
using the quantitative charcoal-dextran technique, as
described elsewhere.22 Tumors with a receptor concentration of 10 fmol/mg or 25 fmol/mg cytosol protein were considered estrogen receptor (ER)-negative
or progesterone receptor (PgR)-negative, respectively;
tumors with receptor content above these values
were considered receptor positive (ER-positive/PgRpositive).
Patients were seen at 4- to 6-month intervals at
the outpatient department of our institute for the
first 5 years and yearly thereafter. Mammograms and
chest x-rays were obtained annually. Disease status
or cause of death was ascertained by contacting
patients’ general practitioners. The median follow-up
was 15 years (interquartile range, 14–17 years).

Statistical Analysis
Endpoints were breast cancer events (ipsilateral
axillary disease, ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence
[IBTR], and distant metastasis) and breast cancer
mortality (whichever occurred first). Crude cumulative incidence curves for events were estimated in a
competing risk framework,23 so that the estimate of a
breast cancer event curve considered the other 2
possible breast cancer events, contralateral cancer,
other malignancy, and death without evidence of
breast disease, as competing events. The breast cancer mortality curve considered death from other
malignancy and death from other causes as competing events. Cox regression models were used to perform multivariable analyses of pT, histologic type, and
ER/PgR status that were modeled by using dummy
variables and tested with a 2-sided Wald test. P
values <.05 were considered significant. The time to
each endpoint was calculated from the date of surgery; in the absence of an event, time was censored

RESULTS
The clinical characteristics of the 354 patients are
shown in Table 1. Most patients (77%) had a pT1 tumor, and 6% of patients had pT4b tumors. Invasive
ductal carcinoma was the predominant histologic
type (65%) followed by invasive lobular carcinoma
(20%). ER and PgR status was available for 331
patients; of these, 310 patients (94%) had ER-positive
tumors, 227 patients (69%) had PgR-positive tumors,
224 patients (68%) had ER-positive/PgR-positive
tumors, and 18 patients (5%) had ER-negative/PgRnegative tumors.

months to 16 years). The crude cumulative incidence
of IBTR 15 years after surgery was 8.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.8%–11.7%), and the corresponding incidence in women with pT1 disease
was 7.3% (95% CI, 4.8%–11.3%). Patients with
IBTR always underwent conservative resection. Five
patients subsequently developed distant metastases
and died from their breast disease, 2 patients died
from a second primary tumor, and 12 patients died
from causes unrelated to breast cancer. In the multivariable analysis, IBTR was significantly associated
with ER/PgR status (P 5 .021), with more recurrences
observed among women with ER-positive/PgR-positive tumors, but was not associated with pT or histologic type, although the hazard ratios (HRs) for IBTR
were considerably greater than 1 for >pT1 tumors
and lobular morphology.
Sixteen patients developed ipsilateral axillary disease as their first event at a median of 3 years (range,
from 10 months to 15 years) after surgery. The crude
15-year cumulative incidence for women with axillary disease was 4.2% (95% CI, 2.6%–7%), and the
corresponding incidence for women with pT1 tumors
was 4.0% (95% CI, 2.3%–7.2%). Axillary disease was
treated by delayed dissection in 5 patients, radiotherapy in 9 patients, and second-line hormone treatment in 2 other patients. Nine of the 16 patients
subsequently developed distant metastases and died
from this condition. Multivariable analysis of this
endpoint was not performed because of the small
number of events.
Thirty-one patients developed distant metastases
as their first event; and they all received second-line
hormone treatment: 30 patients died from the
disease, and 1 patient died from a second primary
tumor. The crude 15-year cumulative incidence of
distant metastases was estimated at 8.8% (95% CI,

6.3%–12.3%). In the multivariable analysis, >pT1 disease (P < .001) and lobular histotype (P 5 .005) were
significantly associated with distant metastasis,
whereas ER/PgR status was not, although the HR for
ER-negative disease was more than 3 times greater
than the HR for ER-positive/PgR-positive disease.
Six contralateral breast cancers occurred as a
first event 5 months, 15 months, 21 months, 39
months, 112 months, and 122 months after surgery.
Nineteen patients developed second primaries at a
nonbreast site (6 gastrointestinal cancers, 3 endometrial cancers, 2 lung cancers, 2 renal cancers, 2 hematologic cancers, 1 gastric cancer, 1 vulvar cancer,
1 bladder cancer, and 1 oropharyngeal cancer). The
endometrial cancers were diagnosed 29 months, 35
months, and 101 months after breast surgery.
Overall, 268 patients died during follow-up,
including 62 deaths from malignancy (46 from breast
cancer and 16 from second nonbreast primary). The
crude 15-year cumulative incidence of death from
breast cancer was 12.6% (95% CI, 9.6%–16.7%). Large
tumor size (>pT1; P 5 .002) and lobular histologic
type (P 5 .004) were significantly associated with
increased breast cancer mortality by multivariable
analysis, whereas ER/PGR status was not, although
the HR for ER-negative disease was nearly 2.5 times
greater than the HR for ER-positive/PgR-positive disease. Of the 251 patients who had no cancer event,
182 patients (73%) died from intercurrent disease,

mostly from cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events
or ‘natural causes.’ No patient died of thrombophlebitic complications.

DISCUSSION
The most important finding of this study was that
only 16 of our 354 patients—none of whom received
primary axillary treatment—developed axillary disease after a median follow-up of 15 years, for a crude
cumulative incidence of 4.2%. Most of our patients
(77.4%) had pT1 disease, and the crude cumulative
incidence of axillary disease in this group was 4%.
Furthermore, most deaths (222; 83% of all deaths)
were from causes unrelated to breast cancer. These
findings reinforce the hypothesis of our study that, in
elderly patients with early breast cancer, the combined regimen of breast-conserving surgery plus
long-term tamoxifen is sufficient to achieve longterm control of breast disease.
In a series of 671 consecutive elderly patients
with breast cancer and no palpable axillary lymph
nodes who underwent surgery at our institute,26 axillary involvement was identified on histologic examination in 34% of patients who underwent axillary
dissection; however, in the patients who did not
undergo axillary dissection, the cumulative incidence
of axillary occurrence was 4.4% after 5 years. Similarly, in our previous randomized study12 on older

The categories pT2 and pT4b were merged, and the categories ER2/PgR2 and ER2/PgR1 were merged because of the low number of events or patients. The analysis did not include axillary disease, again,

patients with T1N0 breast cancer, 23% of patients
who underwent axillary dissection had involved axillary lymph nodes, whereas only 1.8% of the patients
who did not receive axillary clearance developed axillary disease and underwent axillary dissection after a
median 5 years of follow-up.
These results are in line with the 25-year finding
of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel
Project-04 trial27 that overall survival and distant
relapse-free survival in patients with breast cancer
who underwent radical mastectomy were equivalent
to those of patients who underwent surgery without

axillary dissection. The authors of that report estimated that 40% of their patients without axillary
clearance had positive lymph nodes; however, only
18% subsequently developed axillary relapse and
required delayed lymph node dissection. The results
from that study also indicated that overall survival
and breast cancer mortality did not differ in relation
to the timing of axillary clearance (at the same time
as primary breast surgery or later, if axillary disease
became manifest).
Similar results were reported from the International Breast Cancer Study Group trial 10–93,28 in

which no substantial difference in disease-free survival or overall survival was observed between axillary surgery or observation in patients aged 60
years with clinically lymph node negative breast cancer after a median follow-up of 6.6 years. Again, a
considerable proportion of patients (28%) in that trial
who underwent axillary dissection had metastatic
axillary lymph nodes, whereas the axillary relapse
rate was 2% in the group who did not undergo axillary clearance.
Hughes et al.29 also reported a very low axillary
relapse rate in women aged 70 years with T1N0,
ER-positive breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy alone and received tamoxifen. Only 2 of 204
patients (0.9%) required delayed axillary dissection
for the development of clinically positive lymph
nodes over a median follow-up of 5 years.
Two points stand out from all of these studies.
Patients in the observation arm had a much lower
rate of axillary metastases than expected, and breast
cancer mortality and overall survival were indistinguishable in the observation and elective axillary dissection arms.
Tamoxifen must have contributed substantially
to the low rate of axillary recurrence, given its proven
ability to suppress receptor-positive disease.30,31
Another explanation may be that not all metastatic
foci in lymph nodes become active biologically and
progress to overt axillary disease.
In our study, patients with ER-positive/PgR-positive cancers, in the multivariable analysis, had a significantly greater HR for IBTR than other receptor
categories, whereas the HRs for distant metastases
and breast cancer mortality were nearly 3 times

greater in ER-negative patients than in ER-positive/
PgR-positive patients; however, confidence intervals
were wide in relation to the low numbers of events
in patients with a receptor status other than ER-positive/PgR-positive (Tables 3, 4). Nevertheless our data
suggest that, in elderly patients, negative ER status,
as expected, is a predictor of distant metastases and
breast cancer mortality, whereas patients with more
favorable receptor status survive longer to develop
IBTR.
With regard to tumor size, there were more
breast cancer deaths among women with pT2 tumors
than among women with pT1 tumors (Table 3). Multivariable analysis indicated that, as expected, the
HRs for IBTR, distant metastasis, and breast cancer
mortality were higher for >pT1 tumors compared
with <pT1 tumors, however the difference was significant only for the latter 2 events.
With regard to the effect of histology on events,
the multivariable analysis demonstrated that lobular
histotype was significantly associated with distant
metastasis and breast cancer mortality and also (not
significantly) with IBTR. A multivariable analysis of
ipsilateral axillary disease was not performed
because of the low number of events; however, ipsilateral axillary disease was about half as frequent in
patients with the lobular than ductal histotype (Table
3), suggesting that axillary disease is unrelated to distant metastasis and breast cancer mortality.
Patients with pT4b tumors had a greater probability of developing axillary disease than patients
with pT1 and pT2 tumors but had lower rates of distant metastases and breast cancer deaths (Table 3).
These numeric differences are consistent with the
hypothesis that axillary involvement may be unrelated to distant metastases and breast cancer mortality; however, they were not investigated in our
multivariable analysis because of the small number
of ipsilateral axillary events.
A striking finding of this study was the exceptionally low cumulative rate of IBTR after a median
follow-up of 15 years (8.3% for the entire series, 7.3%
for T1 cancers). This finding is consistent with other
findings in elderly patients who did not receive residual breast radiotherapy. Thus, a randomized trial29
that investigated radiotherapy in elderly patients
with T1N0, ER-positive breast cancer who underwent
conservative surgery and received tamoxifen had
local control rates of 96% in the group without radiotherapy and 99% in the group with radiotherapy at
5 years; furthermore, no significant difference was
observed in overall survival or breast cancer mortality between the 2 groups. Similarly, the long-term
results from a trial conducted by Veronesi et al.19 to

Elderly Patients With Breast Cancer/Martelli et al.

assess the role of breast radiotherapy in patients who
underwent breast-conserving surgery indicated that
the local relapse rate was related to age, with significantly fewer local relapses in the no-radiotherapy
arm among women aged 55 years compared with
younger women. The difference in the local relapse
rate between the radiotherapy and no-radiotherapy
arms disappeared completely in patients aged >65
years. These findings and those of others17,18 indicate
that the risk of developing a local relapse after
breast-preserving surgery declines with age and that
radiotherapy may be safely avoided in elderly
patients with early-stage breast cancer provided that
breast-conserving surgery is radical and adjuvant
hormone therapy is administered.
The limitations of the current study are that it
was not a randomized, controlled trial and that the
series was relatively small. However, it is difficult to
recruit elderly patients to clinical trials, and it is even
more difficult to follow them for 15 years.
To conclude, our study provides important support—at a median follow-up of 15 years—for the
results of our previous studies20,21,26: Elderly patients
with early breast cancer and a clinically clear axilla
are adequately treated by breast-conserving surgery
and long-term tamoxifen without axillary dissection,
without sentinel lymph node biopsy, and without
postoperative radiotherapy. This conservative strategy
helps maintain quality of life in a vulnerable group
of patients by avoiding the complications of axillary
surgery and the difficulties of radiotherapy.
