ABSTRACT
Noscapine, a naturally occurring opium alkaloid, is a widely used antitussive
medication. Noscapine has low toxicity and recently it was also found to possess
cytotoxic activity which led to the development of many noscapine analogues. In
this paper we report on the synthesis and testing of a novel noscapine analogue.
Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT colorimetric assay using SKBR-3 and paclitaxelresistant SKBR-3 breast cancer cell lines using different concentrations for both
noscapine and the novel compound. Microtubule polymerization assay was used
to determine the effect of the new compound on microtubules. To compare the
binding affinity of noscapine and the novel compound to tubulin, we have done a
fluorescence quenching assay. Finally, in silico methods using docking calculations
were used to illustrate the binding mode of the new compound to α,β-tubulin. Our
cytotoxicity results show that the new compound is more cytotoxic than noscapine
on both SKBR-3 cell lines. This was confirmed by the stronger binding affinity
of the new compound, compared to noscapine, to tubulin. Surprisingly, our new
compound was found to have strong microtubule-destabilizing properties, while
noscapine is shown to slightly stabilize microtubules. Our calculation indicated that
the new compound has more binding affinity to the colchicine-binding site than
to the noscapine site. This novel compound has a more potent cytotoxic effect on
cancer cell lines than its parent, noscapine, and hence should be of interest as a
potential anti-cancer drug.

has some pharmacological advantages. Noscapine was
found to be effective in slowing tumour growth while
having little toxicity in normal tissues [4], is effective
in multidrug resistant cell lines [5], and has a favorable
pharmacokinetic profile [6]. Noscapine is also known to
trigger apoptosis in different cancer cell lines through
the activation of different apoptotic pathways [7–10].
Over the last decade, many noscapine analogues have
been synthesized and tested, showing anti-cancer
activity superior to the parent noscapine. These
analogues are synthesized by chemically modifying
the parent noscapine molecule, while keeping the

INTRODUCTION
Noscapine, a phthalide isoquinoline alkaloid, is a
natural product that was first isolated and characterized
in 1817 by Pierre-Jean Robiquet [1] from the opium
poppy, Papaver somniferum. Unlike other opium
alkaloids, noscapine is non-addictive, non-narcotic and
non-analgesic. It is widely used in many countries as
an antitussive (cough suppressant) agent and has a low
toxicity profile [2]. In 1998, the Joshi group found that
noscapine possesses anticancer activity due to its action
on tubulin [3]. As a tubulin-binding agent, noscapine

scaffold intact. The first generation noscapinoids were
generated by chemically modifying the isoquinoline
and benzofuranone rings of noscapine. This includes the
9'-halogenated (chloro-, bromo- and iodo-noscapine)
[11], 9'-amino [12], 9'-nitro [13] and the 9'-azido
analogues [14]. The first generation also includes cyclic
ether halogenated analogues [15]. O-alkylated and
O-acylated analogues represent the second-generation
noscapinoids that were generated by modifying the
benzofuranone ring of noscapine [16]. Third-generation
noscapinoids were synthesized by modifying the
substituents coupled to the nitrogen of the isoquinoline
ring (Figure 1) [17].
Noscapine binds to tubulin stoichiometrically [18] to
induce a conformational change in the protein [3], as found
for other anti-mitotic agents that target tubulin [19,20].
Noscapine is unique from other antimitotic agents since
it has no significant effect on microtubule stabilization
or destabilization [5], but instead alters the dynamic
instability of microtubules by increasing the time spent
in the pause phase [5]. Similar structural features between
noscapine and colchicine, a known destabilizing agent
[21], initially suggested these compounds may bind to
the same site, although experiments found that noscapine
does not compete with colchicine for binding to tubulin
[3]. Interestingly, a small modification altering noscapine
to 9-bromonoscapine results in a compound that disrupts
colchicine binding [22], and slightly inhibits microtubule
polymerization [23]. Therefore, understanding how
noscapine and its analogues bind to and affect tubulin
and microtubules has proven challenging without
crystal structures or hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass
spectrometry.
In 2011, using computational docking and
molecular dynamics methods, noscapine was predicted
to bind to a unique site on β-tubulin at the intradimer
interface that is near the colchicine site, but does not
interfere with colchicine binding [24]. This result was
supported by competitive binding experiments showing

a lack of competition between noscapine and colchicine
[3]. Based on this newly identified binding site, a new
library of noscapine analogues was proposed, which were
computationally predicted to have higher affinity towards
tubulin than noscapine [24]. These newly proposed
analogues share a common scaffold within their structures.
In our subsequent attempts to synthesize this common
scaffold, we came across an interesting compound that
showed promising anti-proliferative activity compared to
noscapine.
In this study, we report the effect of this novel
compound 8, on SKBR-3 breast cancer cells, its affinity
towards tubulin, as well as its effects on microtubule
polymerization. We have also studied the binding of
this compound to various sites on tubulin using in silico
methods.

RESULTS
Synthetic pathway for the new compound (8)
Our synthesis (Scheme 1) began with the
commercially available isovanillin 1. Regioselective
bromination of 1 gave the 2-bromoisovanillin 2 [25]
in 83% yield. This was followed by methylation of the
phenolic hydroxyl group in 2 to give the 2-bromo3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde 3 [26] in 76% yield. The
phosphonium salt 5 was synthesized from the piperonyl
alcohol 4 according to the literature procedure [27] in 93%
overall yield. Compounds 3 and 5 were then coupled under
Wittig reaction conditions to give inseparable E/Z olefin
mixture, which was then treated with CuCN to afford a
separable mixture of 6a/6b in 80% global yield with 60:40
ratio in favor of 6a [28]. The Z-isomer 6a was converted
to the desired E-isomer using a palladium catalyzed
isomerisation process [29]. Compound 6b was then
converted exclusively to the enantiomerically pure (>99%
ee) phthalide 7 via Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation
using AD mix-β followed by in-situ cyclization with the
cyano group [28]. We were also able to obtain an X-ray
crystal structure1 for 7 (Figure 2). Conversion of 7 to
the target molecule 9 via a sequence of tosylation, azide
displacement and reduction failed, and only the undesired
compound 8 was isolated in 65% yield. It is worth
mentioning that treatment of 7 with triflic anhydride in
pyridine or diphenyl phospheryl azide (DPPA) led to the
formation of 8 in comparable yield.

A Crystallographic Information File (CIF) for
the structure of compound 7 is available as supporting
information. The crystallographic data are also available
free of charge from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Center (http://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk) using the registry
number CCDC 1433128.

were expecting compound 8 to have a similar effect on
MT polymerization as noscapine, however it was found to
destabilize MT (Figure 3). These results suggest a different
mechanism of action for compound 8 than noscapine.

Binding affinity of the new compound (8)
To test whether noscapine and compound 8 interact
directly with tubulin, the fluorescence of α,β-tubulin
heterodimers was examined in the presence and absence
of noscapine, as well as compound 8. Interestingly,
recombinant purified βI-tubulin was found to form
homodimers, which gave the same characteristic bellshaped tryptophan fluorescence with significant quenching
in the presence of different concentrations of the tested
compounds. The homodimer formation was confirmed by
running native gel electrophoresis using a 10 µL solution
containing 30 µg of the purified recombinant βI-tubulin
(Figure 4).
The effect of both noscapine and compound 8
were tested on αI,βI-tubulin heterodimers, αI,βIII-tubulin
heterodimers, βI,βI-tubulin homodimers and porcine brain
tubulin (unfractionated) to observe if there are any isotypespecific effects. Both compounds displayed notable
quenching of tryptophan fluorescence in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 5 and Table 1); however
compound 8 showed a stronger quenching profile. These
fluorescence quenching studies indicated that the ability
of compound 8 to induce conformational changes upon
binding varies depending on the tubulin isoform. The

The effect of the new compound (8) on MT
polymerization
To determine the effect of noscapine and compound
8 upon the assembly of tubulin subunits into microtubules,
changes in the turbidity of tubulin solution were measured
in the absence or presence of the tested compounds.
The control (tubulin in the prepared buffer with DMSO)
represents the normal polymerization of microtubules
in the absence of any added compounds at 37°C

used to represent MT polymerization. Noscapine is known
to stabilize MT leading to their polymerization [3], however

the SKBR-3 cell line with an IC50 of ~40 μM compared to
~100 μM for noscapine (Figure 6a). The same effect was
also observed when using the paclitaxel-resistant SKBR-3,
where compound 8 showed an IC50 of ~64 μM compared
to ~100 μM for noscapine (Figure 6b).

Determination of the binding site of the new
compound (8) on tubulin
The above experimental results indicate that
compound 8 is a microtubule-destabilizing agent
(Figure 3), and therefore affects microtubules differently
than noscapine. Although compound 8 is structurally
similar to noscapine, it also shares some similarity with
the microtubule-destabilizing agents colchicine and
combretastatin A4, both of which are thought to bind to
the colchicine domain located at the intra-dimer interface
of αβ-tubulin [33,34]. Furthermore, compound 8 has
several features that match the pharmacophore for the
colchicine site that was developed by Nguyen et al. based
on the binding of colchicine, combretastatin A4 and other
agents [35]. Therefore, we performed docking simulations
to investigate the binding mode and the binding strength
of these compounds to the colchicine binding site, and
establish similarities in binding poses that may provide
support for compound 8 binding to this site.
Docking scores indicate that colchicine binds with
the greatest affinity, followed by combretastatin A4, while
compound 8 has the lowest affinity for tubulin (Figure 7).
The top-ranked docking poses for colchicine resemble
the crystal structure pose, providing confidence in our
docking protocols. Small variations exist in the orientation
of the acetamide relative to the crystal structure, which
has been previously shown to have high mobility in the
binding site [36]. The top poses of the other ligands are
also similar, which indicates a common binding motif can
be established.
A comparison of the energy-minimized top
docking pose for each of the three compounds indicates
some variability (Figure 7). Both combretastatin A4 and
compound 8 bind deeper into β-tubulin than colchicine,
which supports previous work that found flexible
ligands bind more deeply [36]. For each compound, the
methoxy-containing A ring is directed into β-tubulin near
Cys241, and overlap of these rings is observed for the
compounds studied, as previously found for colchicine
and combretastatin A4 [35,37,38]. The colchicine A
ring has been identified as an essential feature of the
pharmacophore [39]. However, no direct hydrogen bonds
form between the protein and these methoxy groups. It
is possible stability is gained from an S-H∙∙∙O or S−H∙∙∙π
interaction between Cys241 and the A ring of the ligands.
Interactions occur between the ligands and residues
Lys254 and Lys352; ligand lone pairs are directed towards
the lysine side chain amino group in the binding poses
for all three ligands (Figure 7). However, colchicine is

αI,βIII-tubulin isoform was found to be particularly
affected, and it should be noted that βIII-tubulin is highly
expressed in resistant tumor cells [30].

Antiproliferative effect of the new compound (8)
Arresting breast cancer cell growth and viability
is still a challenge especially in view of drug resistance
[31,32], which calls for the development of appropriate
new modalities of treatment. The effect of noscapine and
compound 8 (Figure 6) on the viability of the human breast
cancer cell lines SKBR-3, and paclitaxel-resistant SKBR-3
was investigated using the colorimetric MTT assay. This
was motivated by the earlier studies discussed above that
indicated noscapine may be suitable for drug development
towards cancer chemotherapy with relatively low toxicity
compared to other anti-mitotic agents. Our data revealed
that compound 8 was more cytotoxic than noscapine on

positioned closest to these lysine residues, compared to
the other ligands. Arg258 is also in a position to interact
with the ligands. These features indicate that compound 8
binds to the colchicine site in a fashion similar to that of
other known colchicine-domain ligands.

IC50 values of ~40 μM and 64 μM for the normal and
the resistant SKBR-3 cell lines respectively. These
cytotoxicity results were confirmed by the fluorescence
quenching assays, which showed that compound 8 has
lower Kd values, thus higher binding affinity, than its
parent noscapine towards tubulin. The fluorescence
quenching assays were done on porcine brain tubulin
as well as purified recombinant tubulin dimers (βI,βItubulin, αI,βI-tubulin and αI,βIII-tubulin). All tubulin
isoforms showed similar results confirming the stronger
binding of compound 8 towards tubulin. To determine
the effect of compound 8 on microtubules, whether it
stabilizes or destabilizes their polymerization, we did
a MT polymerization assay using both compound 8 as
well as noscapine. Noscapine is a known MT stabilizer
that enhances the polymerization of MT. Interestingly,
in contrast to noscapine, we found that compound
8 has strong microtubule-destabilizing properties.
This surprising result suggest a different mechanism
of action for compound 8, which might be due to a
different binding site on the α,β-tubulin protein.
To have a deep insight on the binding site and mode
of this compound to α,β-tubulin, we performed docking
calculations for both compound 8 and noscapine towards
both the colchicine as well as the noscapine binding sites.

DISCUSSION
This paper reports the results of synthesis, in vitro
testing and in silico modeling of a novel noscapine
analogue 8. Noscapine has been repurposed from its
original application as an anti-tussive agent to a cancer
chemotherapy, particularly as a second line of treatment
[40]. Unfortunately, while showing low toxicity, it also
failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy in clinical trials
[41], although it shows some promise as a prophylactic
agent [42]. In this paper, we focused on an analogue of
noscapine that was synthesized in the hope of improving
its cytotoxicity profile compared to the parent compound.
In MTT assays involving both SKBR-3 and
the paclitaxel-resistant SKBR-3 breast cancer cell
line, both noscapine and compound 8 show cytotoxic
activity in the sub-mM range, with compound 8 being
demonstrably more potent. Noscapine had IC50 of ~100
for both cell lines, however compound 8 showed lower

Theses calculations have illustrated the binding mode of
compound 8 to α,β-tubulin at the colchicine binding site,
which we have shown is similar to that of other colchicine
domain binders. This finding is consistent with structural
features of compound 8 that have strong similarity with
colchicine. It appears, therefore, that starting from the
noscapine scaffold one can design compounds that
gradually lose affinity for the noscapine-binding site and
acquire propensity to bind to the colchicine binding site.
Concomitant with this, there is a change in the mode of
action of the compound, from stabilizing microtubules
to destabilizing microtubules. It’s worth mentioning that
although compound 8 possesses low potency, it can be
used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents
(paclitaxel) due to its low toxicity to get a synergistic
effect and overcome cancer resistance. Similar effects were
observed for paclitaxel when used in combination with the
reduced 5-bromonoscapine analogue [43,44]. Therefore
further exploration of this new scaffold is required for the
development of more potent tubulin binders.

(6.99 g, 14.7 mmol) in anhydrous THF (30 mL) at 0 °C.
The solution was stirred for 30 min at 0 °C, then 2-bromo3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde 3 (3.41 g, 14.0 mmol) in
THF (15 mL) was added dropwise via syringe at the same
temperature. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir
for 14 h at room temperature (monitored by TLC). The
reaction mixture was then cooled to 0 °C, and saturated
solution of NH4Cl (25 mL) was added. The aqueous layer
was separated and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 25 mL). The
organic layers were combined, washed with water, brine,
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated
under reduced pressure to give the crude product as a
mixture of E/Z. The crude product was then dissolved in
DMF (40 mL) at room temperature. CuCN (1.88 g, 21.0

Preparation of human αI-, βI- and βIII-tubulin
The protein sequence of human αI-tubulin is given
by UniProtKB accession number Q71U36 (gene name
TUBA1A), the protein sequence of human βI-tubulin is
given by UniProtKB accession number P07437 (gene
name TUBB) and that of human βIII-tubulin is given
by UniProtKB accession number Q13509 (gene name
TUBB3). The cloning work for αI- and βI-tubulin was
performed and reported previously [45]. For the βIII
human tubulin protein, the sequence was converted into
DNA sequences with codons optimized for production
in Escherichia coli, and for purification purposes, a
His-tag was added at the N-terminus. The βIII-tubulin
gene was inserted into a pET15b vector between the
XhoI and NdeI restriction sites. The correct sequence,
insertion, and orientation of the tubulin constructs were
verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant proteins were
expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) host cells in LB medium
supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin. The cultures
were grown at 37 °C until an OD600 = 0.8 was reached,
and the cells were induced with 1.0 mM isopropyl b-D1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 18 h at 25 °C. After
induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (6000
× g for 20 min at 4 °C in SLC-6000 evolution sorvall
rotor). The three variants of the tubulin protein were
isolated from the inclusion bodies.
The αI-, βI- and βIII-tubulin constructs were purified
in the same manner via fast refolding by dilution with metal
affinity chromatography (IMAC) using a Ni-NTA column. The
cell pellets from 1 L of the LB medium with expressed tubulin
protein were resuspended in 25 mL of buffer A (buffer A: 50
mM Tris, 50 mM MgSO4, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.8) and lysed by
sonication (using Fisher Scientific Ultrasonic Dismembrator
Model 500 with microtip probe for 4 times (30 seconds each)
pulses at 45% power) on ice followed by centrifugation at
12000 × g for 20 min (4 °C) in JA 25–50 fixed angle rotor,
Beckman Coulter centrifuge. The supernatant was removed,
and the inclusion bodies were cleaned by a series of washing
steps with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 25%
glycerol, 500 mM NaCl, and 2 M urea as a separate additive
for every next wash. Inclusion bodies were centrifuged at
12,000 × g for 20 min (4 °C) in JA 25–50 rotor after every
wash, and the supernatant was removed. The clean protein
pellet was solubilized in buffer B (buffer B: 50 mM Tri50
mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 8 M urea, 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.8) and left for slowly rotated incubation at
room temperature overnight. The next day, the sample was

Cell culture

Binding experiments and tryptophan
fluorescence quenching assays

The human breast cancer cell lines SKBR-3 and
paclitaxel-resistant SKBR-3 were kindly provided by Marc
St. George (University of Alberta, Canada) [48]. Both cell
lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO) with
10% fetal calf serum and 1 mM L-glutamine 1% penicillin/
streptomycin mixture under a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. Addition of 16.65 nM paclitaxel to
the paclitaxel-resistant cell line is mandatory to keep the
acquired resistance at the same efficiency level.

In a 96-well microplate, equimolar mixtures of
recombinant human tubulin monomers , as well as buffer
(10 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM GTP,
0.5% DMSO, 250 mM sucrose, pH 7.0) were combined
to reach a final tubulin dimer concentration of 2 µM for
βI,βI-tubulin, αI,βI-tubulin and αI,βIII-tubulin. GTP was
added to the samples to a final concentration of 1 mM. The
microplate was incubated on ice for 10 min to allow for the
formation of the tubulin dimer. The calculated amounts of
stock solution of the compounds in DMSO were added to
the protein samples to obtain final ligand concentrations of
5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 µM. The control was ligandfree, and the total sample volume was 100 µL. A glass bead
was inserted into each well, and the microplate was covered
with protective film, sealed with a lid, and incubated for 30
min at 25 °C. After that time, the microplate was transferred
to a rotating plate form and vigorously rotated for 1 h at
room temperature. From each well, 80 µL of samples
and control were transferred to a 1 cm fluorescence cell.
Fluorescence spectra were collected on a PTI MODELMP1 spectrofluorometer using a 10 mm path length cell at
295 nm (excitation wavelength) and a scan range of 310–
400 nm. Data analysis was performed using ORIGIN 6.1
software (Origin-Lab, Northampton, MA, USA).

MTT assay
The human breast cancer cell lines SKBR-3 and
paclitaxel-resistant SKBR-3 (1 × 104 cells per well) were
seeded into 96-well plates. After incubation for 24 h
(when cells reached 70–80% confluency), the medium
was aspirated and the cells were treated with several
concentrations of noscapine, as well as compound 8. After
21 h incubation, 50 μL of MTT (1 mg/mL) solution was
added and the plates were incubated for an additional 3 h.
After centrifugation, supernatant was removed from each
well and 150 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added
to dissolve the insoluble formazan crystals. The absorbance
was measured at 570 nm and 690 nm subtracted as a
background, using microplate reader. The data was plotted
using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software. IC50 and statistical
analysis (t-test) were calculated using the same software.

heterodimer for docking, hydrogen atoms were added by
the tleap module of AmberTools [49] and the Protonate
3D tool in the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE)
software program [50] Nucleotide cofactors and magnesium
ions were retained. Subsequently, this complex was energy
minimized using the Amber12:EHT force field in MOE.
Using the MOE program, compounds were docked
to the receptor at the colchicine site identified in the 1SA0
structure. An induced fit protocol was used for docking
calculations. The receptor was defined as the protein,
nucleotide cofactors and Mg2+ ions. Receptor atoms belonging
to residues within 4.5 Å from the crystalized colchicine
coordinates were allowed to move during docking. Docking
poses were first scored with the London dG method and the
top 30 unique hits were rescored with the GBVI/WSA dG
methods, where the top 10 unique hits were retained. Duplicate
poses were discarded. Following the docking calculations, the
ligand-receptor complex for the top pose of each compound
was energy minimized using the Amber12:EHT force field in
MOE to maximize ligand-receptor interactions.
