Abstract
To understand the mechanism of cellular resistance to the
nucleoside analogue cytarabine (1-B-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, AraC), two resistant derivatives of the human leukemic
line CCRF-CEM were obtained by stepwise selection in
different concentrations of AraC. CEM/4AraC cells showed
low AraC resistance, whereas CEM/20AraC cells showed high
resistance. Both cell lines showed similar patterns of crossresistance to multiple cytotoxic nucleoside analogues, with
the exception that CEM/20AraC cells remained sensitive to
5-fluorouridine and 2-deoxy-5-fluorouridine. Both cell lines
were sensitive to 5-fluorouracil and to a variety of natural
product drugs. Although both CEM/4AraC and CEM/
20AraC cells displayed reduced intracellular accumulation
of [3H]AraC, only CEM/4AraC cells showed reduced uptake
of [3H]uridine, which was used to assess nucleoside transport
activities. Genes encoding proteins known to be involved in
nucleoside transport, efflux, and metabolism were analyzed
for the presence of mutations in the two cell lines. In
CEM/4AraC cells, independent mutations were identified at
each allele of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1
(hENT1; SLC29A1), one corresponding to a single-nucleotide
change in exon 4, the other being a complex intronic mutation
disrupting splicing of exon 13. In contrast to CEM/20AraC
cells, CEM/4AraC cells did not bind the hENT1/SLC29A1
ligand nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside and
lacked detectable hENT1/SLC29A1 protein. In CEM/20AraC
cells, independent intronic mutations impairing splicing of
exons 2 and 3 were found at each allele of the deoxycytidine
kinase gene. These studies point to at least two distinct
mechanisms of AraC resistance in leukemic cells. [Cancer Res
2008;68(7):2349–57]

Introduction
Cytarabine (1-h-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, AraC) is a deoxycytidine analogue that has been used either alone or in
combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; refs. 1–3), relapsed and
refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; refs. 4–6), and other
malignancies (7–10). The chemotherapeutic efficacy of cytarabine
varies dramatically between individuals. In general, standard

induction therapy with combination of anthracycline and cytarabine produced 50% to 75% of complete remission rate in adult
AML patients (1–3). Higher remission rate has been observed in
newly diagnosed pediatric AML patients treated with improved
chemotherapeutic regimens (11, 12). However, f30% to 50% of
patients relapse with drug resistant disease. Differences in genetic
background, as well as efficiency of drug uptake, metabolism,
and elimination may account for variable effectiveness of AraCcontaining drug regimens.
Nucleoside analogue drugs, such as AraC and gemcitabine, have
low rates of passive diffusion across membranes and enter cells
primarily as fraudulent substrates for specialized nucleoside
transporter proteins. Two distinct families of human nucleoside
transporter proteins have been identified and characterized to
date: the human equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hENT1–
hENT4; also known as SLC29A1–SLC29A4) and the human
concentrative nucleoside transporters (hCNT1–hCNT3; also known
as SLC28A1–SLC28A3). hENT1/SLC29A1 has been shown to be the
primary transporter responsible for cellular uptake of AraC (see
refs. 13–17 for recent reviews). Once inside cells, AraC is ‘‘activated’’
to form AraCTP through sequential phosphorylation by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), dCMP kinase, and nucleoside diphosphate
kinase. The cytotoxicity of AraC is subsequently accomplished
by nonproductive incorporation of AraCTP into nascent DNA or
RNA. Decreased expression of SLC29A1 mRNA and DCK mRNA is
associated with reduced level of intracellular AraC uptake and
reduced DCK activity, respectively; both alterations are associated
with increased cellular resistance to AraC and gemcitabine in
cancer cell lines (14–16, 18, 19). Although loss of SLC29A1 gene
function has yet to be described in AraC-resistant cells, numerous
sequence polymorphisms (silent or missense variants) have been
detected in the SLC29A1 gene from different ethnic populations
and have been speculated to contribute in part to the variable
efficacy of AraC (20–22). On the other hand, overexpression of the
gene encoding cytidine deaminase in transfected cells has been
shown to cause increased AraC resistance, via deamination of
AraC, the prodrug, to an inactive form (23–25). In addition,
activation of 5¶-nucleotidase and ribonucleotide reductase may
affect conversion of AraC to the active inhibitor, possibly reducing
its therapeutic efficacy (26–30). The overall efficacy of AraC as an
anticancer drug may thus be modulated by a combination of
factors, including variations in drug uptake, anabolic and catabolic
pathways, as well as efflux activity (13, 17, 31–33).
In the present study, we used CCRF-CEM, an ALL cell line, as
a cellular model to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying
cellular resistance to AraC. Two cytarabine-resistant cell lines,
CEM/4AraC and CEM/20AraC, were developed by continuous
exposures and stepwise selection in increasing concentrations of
AraC. The resistance phenotypes, the drug uptake properties, and
the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed drug

resistance were analyzed in the two resistant cell lines. Although
derived from the same parental cell line, the two cell lines exhibited
two distinct mechanisms of resistance to nucleoside analogue
drugs.

Materials and Methods
Materials. AraC, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 5-fluorouridine, 5-fluoro-2deoxyuridine, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (NBMPR), and
dideoxycytidine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Gemcitabine, Fludara,
and Cladribine were obtained from the Hematology Department of
Royal Victoria Hospital. [5-3H]Uridine (19.3 Ci/mmol), [5-3H]cytosine-h-Darabinofuranoside ([3H]AraC; 15-30 Ci/mmol), [3H]NBMPR (15 Ci/mmol),
and 2¶-[3H]deoxycytidine (27.7 Ci/mmol) were from Moravek Biochemicals.
The anti-hENT1 monoclonal antibodies were developed and characterized
previously (34) using synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid
residues 254 to 271 of hENT1/SLC29A1. 5¶-S-{2-(1-[( fluorescein-5-yl)thioureido]-hexanamido)ethyl}-6-N -(4-nitrobenzyl)-5¶-thioadenosine (FTHSAENTA) is a fluorescein-tagged structural analogue of NBMPR that binds
tightly to the transport-inhibitory sites of the hENT1/SLC29A1 protein (35)
and, like SAENTA-FITC (36), can be used as a fluorescent probe to detect
hENT1/SLC29A1 on cell surfaces. All other materials were of the highest
available commercial grade.
Cell lines and culture conditions. Human CCRF-CEM (CEM, Tlymphoblastic leukemia) and HeLa cells were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection. CEM/4AraC and CEM/20AraC were derived,
respectively, by stepwise selection of CEM cells in the presence of AraC
at concentrations equivalent to 4 and 20 its IC50 value for cytotoxicity
against parental CEM cells. Clonal populations of CEM/4AraC were
isolated by limited dilution. RPMI 1640 and DMEM, supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, were used to grow CEM cells and HeLa cells,
respectively. All cells were maintained at 37jC in a humidified air
containing 5% CO2. For CEM/4AraC and CEM/20AraC cells, AraC was
added at the final concentrations used for selection.
Cytotoxicity assay. Cytotoxic effects of various drugs on CEM-resistant
and AraC-resistant cells were assessed using a Trypan Blue dye exclusion
assay. Briefly, cell suspensions (starting densities, 2  105 cells/mL) were
cultured in the presence of graded concentrations of a drug of interest for
72 h. The viable cell counts were determined at various times by Trypan
blue dye exclusion, and the growth rate for each condition was represented
by the slope of the growth curve at exponential phase. The relative growth
rate was obtained as a percentage of the growth rate of each cell line at a
given drug concentration over that seen in the absence of drug. IC50 values
correspond to drug concentrations that led to 50% reductions in cell growth
rates compared with that in the absence of drug.
Preparation of total RNA and standard reverse transcription–PCR.
Total cellular RNA was prepared from exponentially growing CEM, CEM/
4AraC, and CEM/20AraC cells using Tri Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) after
the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription reactions using total
RNA were carried out with random hexamer oligos using M-MuLV reverse
transcriptase (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Gene-specific PCR amplification (reverse transcription–PCR, RT-PCR)
was performed for 25 to 30 cycles using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase high
fidelity (Invitrogen) under experimental conditions suggested by the
supplier. Gene-specific oligonucleotides used to amplify individual cDNA
fragments are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The specificity and purity
of individual RT-PCR products was ascertained by agarose gel electrophoresis before cloning and/or DNA sequencing.
Cloning and sequencing of human SLC29A1 and DCK1 cDNAs
and genomic segments. The oligonucleotides used in RT-PCR
to generate a full-length cDNA for SLC29A1 were SLC29A1-F1, 5¶AGCTAGCAGATCTATCACCATGACAACC AGTCACCA-3¶, and SLC29A1-R2,
5¶-CTCTAGACACAATTGCCCGGAACAGGAA-3¶, which includes restriction
enzyme sites used for subcloning (in italics). SLC29A1 cDNA products were
cloned in a plasmid vector (TOPO cloning kit; Invitrogen). Similarly,
full-length hDCK cDNAs were generated using oligonucleotides hDCKF1 (5¶-AGATCT ATGGC CACCCCGCCCAAGA-3¶) and hD CK-R2

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

(5¶-TCTAGA CAAAGTACTCAAAAACTCTTTGAC-3¶). Twenty-four cDNA
clones from each transformation were expanded, and their DNA sequences
were determined. Sequencing data alignment analysis was performed using
BioEdit software.
Alterations detected in cDNA clones of SLC29A1 and DCK1 were
validated at the genomic level by PCR amplification and sequencing of
the corresponding gene exons (E) and introns (I). PCR fragments
corresponding to I3-E4 and E12-I12-E13 of the SLC29A1 gene and I1-E2
and I2-E3 regions of DCK were obtained using gene-specific oligonucleotide
primer pairs, including SLC29A1-IN3F/SLC29A1-IN4R (5¶-TAGAGAGACTGACAACGGACAG-3¶/5¶-TGCAAGCACAGTGGGCACT-3¶), SLC29A1-IN11F/
SLC29A1-IN13R (5¶-TGCCTCTGTGAGCCTGATAA-3¶/5¶-AACTC TAGATCCTGTCTGATG-3¶) and DCK-In1F/DCK-In2R (5¶-GTAAATCTTGCAAAAG
CTAATG-3¶/5¶-GAAGATATATACCTAAAGCGAGAT-3¶), DCK-In2F/DCKIn3R (5¶-TTGCTGATCATGATTACATTTATTT-3¶/5¶-ATGGCCACGTACAAGCC AT-3¶). The PCR products were then purified, and their sequences
were determined using Thermo sequenase radiolabeled terminator cycle
sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corporation). The sequencing reactions
were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. For
the SLC29A1 E12-I12-E13 and DCK I2-E3 regions, PCR amplicons were
cloned in TOPO vector, and individual clones were sequenced to verify
mutations on individual alleles.
Transfection of human SLC29A1 cDNA into HeLa cells. A wild-type
full-length hENT1/SLC29A1 cDNA ( from CEM) cloned in TOPO vector was
further subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA6-V5-HisA
(Invitrogen) and transiently transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The ‘‘empty’’
pcDNA6-V5-HisA vector was also transfected into HeLa cells as a negative
control. For immunoblotting, cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and washed with PBS. Crude membrane fractions and whole-cell
extracts were prepared and separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunodetection of
the hENT1/SLC29A1 protein was carried out using a monoclonal anti-ENT1
antibody preparation.
Cell surface staining using FTH-SAENTA. The cell surface abundance
of hENT1/SLC29A1 in different CEM cells was determined using FTHSAENTA, a membrane-impermeable NBMPR analogue. Briefly, cells washed
free of media were resuspended in PBS to f105 cells/mL and incubated
with either 0, 100 nmol/L FTH-SAENTA, or 100 nmol/L FTH-SAENTA +
10 Amol/L NBMPR (cells were preincubated with NBMPR for 10 min before
addition of FTH-SAENTA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then
centrifuged, washed once quickly, and, in a small volume of PBS, placed on
polylysine-coated dishes to attach for visualization by confocal microscopy.
For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of cell surface
binding of FTH-SAENTA, cells were washed free of growth medium
and resuspended in sodium buffer (144 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris,
3 mmol/L K2HPO4, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1.4 mmol/L CaCl2, and 5 mmol/L
glucose at pH 7.4) to a final cell density of 2.5  105 cells/mL. Cells were
treated at room temperature for 1 h with either no compound (negative
control), 100 nmol/L FTH-SAENTA, or 100 nmol/L FTH-SAENTA +
10 Amol/L NBMPR. At the end of 1 h, cells were collected by centrifugation
and washed twice with sodium buffer. The cells were analyzed for
fluorescence using a BD Flowcytometer.
Analysis of cell surface hENT1/SLC29A1 sites by [3H]NBMPR
binding. Cell surface abundance of hENT1/SLC29A1 on CEM and CEMAraC cells was assessed by equilibrium binding studies with 10 nmol/L
[3H]NBMPR. Cells were washed free of medium, and cell suspensions
containing 106 cells in 100 AL of sodium buffer were incubated with
10 nmol/L [3H]NBMPR in the absence or presence of 100 nmol/L FTHSAENTA or 10 Amol/L unlabeled NBMPR at room temperature for 1 h. At
the end of the incubation, cells in permeant mixture were centrifuged
through oil (4:1 v/v of silicon oil/mineral oil) to remove free unbound
[3H]NBMPR. The cell pellet was solubilized in 5% Triton X-100 and counted
in a Beckman scintillation counter.
Measurement of [3H]AraC uptake. Assays of [3H]AraC uptake were
conducted in PBS containing 10 mmol/L glucose and 2 mmol/L glutamine
(PBS/GG) at 37jC. Briefly, 106 exponentially growing cells were collected,
washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 500 AL of PBS/GG for 15 min,

after which [3H]AraC ( final concentration, 200 nmol/L) was added and the
reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min. Each reaction mixture was
then gently transferred to a prewarmed microcentrifuge tube containing
200 AL of oil cushion (see above), followed by centrifugation at 8,000  g
for 30 s. After removing supernatants, the cell pellets were washed
twice with PBS, digested with 100 AL of 1 N NaOH, and neutralized by
addition of 100 AL of 1 N HCl. The cell-associated radioactivity was
measured by liquid scintillation counting. For assays under ATP depletion
conditions, PBS was used instead of PBS/GG buffer, and cell suspensions
were preincubated with rotenone (20 ng/mL) for 15 min and then 2deoxyglucose (2 mmol/L) for another 15 min before the addition of
[3H]AraC.
DCK activity assay. DCK activity was determined as described (18) with
minor modifications. Briefly, 4  106 cells (per reaction) were collected,
washed twice with PBS, and lysed in 100 AL of CelLytic M (Sigma) following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation
at 20,000  g for 10 min and used either immediately for DCK assays or
stored at 70jC. DCK activity was measured in reaction mixtures
containing 10 Amol/L [3H]deoxycytidine, 5 mmol/L ATP, 5 mmol/L MgCl2,
50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmol/L NaF, 2 mmol/L DTT, and
1.8 mmol/L thymidine (buffer A). Reactions were started by addition of 5 AL
of cell lysate to 500 AL of prewarmed buffer A ( for 5 min) at 37 jC. For time
courses, 100-AL samples were pipetted onto Whatman DE-81 filter discs

fitted to a vacuum device. Filters were then washed thrice with 5 mL of cold
water each time and air-dried, and the radioactivity on the filters was
measured by liquid scintillation counting. Each experiment was repeated
at least thrice.

Results
Development of AraC-resistant CCRF-CEM cell lines. A
stepwise selection protocol in drug-containing medium was used
to derive AraC-resistant CEM cell lines. The IC50 value of CEM cells
for AraC was 0.025 Amol/L. CEM cells were initially passaged in
small increments of AraC concentrations above this IC50, leading
after several months to the isolation of a subpopulation of CEM
cells that retained excellent growth rates in 0.1 Amol/L AraC and
were designated CEM/4AraC. Further stepwise selection of this
cell population in AraC concentrations up to 20 the IC50 value
resulted in the isolation of a second population of AraC-resistant
cells, CEM/20AraC. Both CEM/4AraC and CEM/20AraC cells
showed no visible morphologic and size differences from their
parental CEM cells. Cytotoxicity assays showed that both CEM/
4AraC-resistant and CEM/20AraC-resistant cell lines were
highly resistant to AraC compared with parental CEM cells, with

increases in their IC50 values of 125-fold and >200-fold, respectively
(Fig. 1). Further drug resistance profiling analysis revealed that
both cell lines were cross-resistant to several nucleoside drugs,
including Gemcitabine, Cladribine, Fludara, and dideoxycytidine,
with higher levels of resistance observed in the CEM/20AraC
cells. However, the two cell lines differed markedly in their degree
of resistance to 5-fluorouridine and 5-fluoro-2¶-deoxyuridine,
with CEM/4AraC being resistant to both compounds, whereas
CEM/20AraC remained as sensitive as the parental CEM cells.
These differences in drug resistance profiles suggested a distinct
mechanistic basis in the two cell populations. Both CEM/4AraC
and CEM/20AraC remained sensitive to 5-FU (Fig. 1) and to a
variety of natural products, including anthracyclines and etoposide
(Fig. 1B). The lack of cross-resistance to natural products suggested
that ABC transporters, such as ABCB1 (MDR1/P-glycoprotein) and
multidrug resistance associated protein ABCC1 (MRP1), were not
responsible for the resistance of these cells.
Expression of candidate genes in AraC-resistant CEM cells.
To gain insight into possible mechanisms responsible for drug
resistance in CEM/4AraC and CEM/20AraC cells, expression
of mRNAs corresponding to several candidate genes known to be
involved in transport and/or metabolism of nucleoside analogue
drugs was investigated by RT-PCR. These genes encoded nucleoside transporters (SLC29A1 and A2, SLC28A1 and A2), ATPdependent efflux pumps (ABCC4 and 5), and enzymes known to be
involved in drug metabolism, such as DCK, cytidine deaminase
(CDADC1), and ribonucleoside reductase large subunit (RRMI).
These analyses failed to detect major differences in expression
levels or sizes of cDNAs produced by the resistant isolates, with
two notable exceptions. CEM/4AraC cells expressed what seemed
to be an altered SLC29A1 mRNA compared with both CEM (Fig. 2)
and CEM/20AraC (data not shown) cells. Using a primer pair
(F1 and R3) designed to amplify the entire coding region of the
SLC29A1 mRNA, CEM/4AraC cells displayed a wild-type product
similar in length to that detected in the parental cells (1380 bp)
but also showed a shorter fragment of f1,260 bp (Fig. 2). Further
RT-PCR studies with other primer pairs consisting of F1 as an

anchor primer (exon 3) and other primers spanning different
portions of the SLC29A1 cDNA showed that the altered product
was only detected with exon 14–derived primers (F1 + R3) and not
with further upstream primers, including one from exon 13 (F1 +
R2). This suggested a possible deletion in the cDNA sequence
derived from the exon 13 region in one or both copies of the
SLC29A1 gene in CEM/4AraC cells. No such alterations were
noted in CEM/20AraC cells.
Genetic lesions in the SLC29A1 gene from CEM/4AraC
cells. To delineate the nature of possible mutations found in
SLC29A1 from CEM/4AraC cells, the amplified RT-PCR products
were cloned and sequenced. Two mutations were found in
SLC29A1 cDNAs from CEM/4AraC cells (Fig. 3A). A nonsense
mutation was detected at the beginning of exon 4 at the Tyr11
codon (TAC!TAA), resulting in a termination codon. The second
mutation was the complete absence of exon 13 in some of the
clones, consistent with the size differences in cDNA products from
CEM/4AraC detected in Fig. 2. Importantly, individual cDNA
clones were found to contain either type of mutation, but not
both, suggesting that the two alterations corresponded to different
genetic lesions on each of the two alleles of the SLC29A1 gene in
CEM/4AraC cells. The mutations detected by cDNA sequencing
were further validated by characterization of the corresponding
genomic regions in the SLC29A1 gene, which were amplified by
PCR and sequenced with [33P]dATP (autoradiograms shown in
Fig. 3B and C). These experiments validated the presence of a
heterozygote nonsense mutation at the genetic codon for Tyr11
of SLC29A1 in genomic DNA from CEM/4AraC cells (Fig. 3B).
Additionally, a complex pattern of sequence alterations was noted
in a 15-nucleotide segment overlapping the exon 13/intron 13
junction of the SLC29A1 gene (Fig. 3C), including an alteration in
the 5¶ splice sequence (GUGAGU!GGGGGU) in intron 13 and a
single-nucleotide deletion in the 3¶ end of exon 13 (Fig. 3C). This
complex mutation was verified by cloning the PCR products
followed by DNA sequencing (Fig. 3C, right) and was, therefore, very
likely to account for the altered splicing of exon 13 detected by
cDNA sequencing from CEM/4AraC RNA. That both types of

mutations were present as heterozygotes in genomic DNA
confirmed results from cDNA sequencing and established that
both alleles of the SLC29A1 gene in CEM/4AraC were null alleles
likely to encode nonfunctional proteins resulting in the absence of
nucleoside transport activity. These data strongly suggest that
mutations in the SLC29A1 gene were responsible for the observed
drug resistance in CEM/4AraC cells.
Lack of hENT1/SLC29A1 protein in CEM/4AraC cells. To
validate the predicted effect of SLC29A1 gene mutations on protein
expression, whole-cell extracts and crude membrane fractions were
prepared from CEM/4AraC and parental CEM cells and analyzed
by immunoblotting with anti-hENT1/SLC29A1 antibodies (Fig. 4A).
In these experiments, HeLa cells transiently expressing a fulllength SLC29A1 cDNA were used as positive controls. Although an
immunoreactive species of predicted molecular mass f60 kDa was
detected in extracts from CEM and HeLa/SLC29A1 transfectants,
this species was undetectable in CEM/4AraC cells (Fig. 4A). The
absence of hENT1/SLC29A1 protein in CEM/4AraC cells was
further validated by the lack of fluorescent staining of isolated
CEM/4AraC clones incubated with FTH-SAENTA, a fluorescent
probe known to specifically bind to cell surface hENT1/SLC29A1
protein, and detectable by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4B). Further
quantification of hENT1/SLC29A1 protein expression using FTHSAENTA staining followed by FACS analysis was conducted

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 4C). Specific binding of FTH-SAENTA to parental CEM cells
was shown by the complete inhibition of binding by preincubation
of cells with the hENT1/SLC29A1-specific inhibitor, NBMPR (Fig.
4C, top). Similar analysis of an isolated CEM/4AraC clone
revealed no such fluorescent labeling on the cell surface in the
absence of NBMPR (Fig. 4C, middle). Three additional CEM/
4AraC clones produced similar results (data not shown). Finally,
results from additional [3H]NBMPR binding studies were consistent with those of the fluorescence labeling studies and showed
binding of the probe to parental CEM cells (competable by FTHSAENTA or unlabeled NBMPR) but not to a CEM/4AraC cell
clone (Fig. 4D). Taken together, the defects in the SLC29A1 gene of
CEM/4AraC cells abolished cell surface expression of the hENT1/
SLC29A1 protein in this drug-resistant cell population.
Drug uptake in CEM/4AraC and CEM/20AraC cells. CEM
cells possess a single type of nucleoside transporter, hENT1/
SLC29A1 (37). The mutations in SLC29A1 found in CEM/4AraC
cells may have impaired nucleoside transport, causing reduced
cellular accumulation and increased resistance to cytotoxic
nucleoside drugs, including AraC. Therefore, uptake of [3H]AraC
was measured in CEM, CEM/4AraC, and CEM/20AraC cells.
Results in Fig. 5A showed that neither CEM/4AraC nor CEM/
20AraC cells accumulated [3H]AraC. This was consistent with
mutations in the SLC29A1 gene of CEM/4AraC cells but

surprising for CEM/20AraC cells, which did not harbor such
mutations and seemingly exhibited hENT1/SLC29A1 on their
surfaces (Fig. 4B and C, bottom). Reduced drug uptake in both
resistant cell lines was not affected by ATP depletion (Fig. 5A),
suggesting that the reduced intracellular accumulation of [3H]AraC
in the CEM/20AraC cells was not caused by defects in unrelated
ATP-dependent drug uptake or drug efflux mechanisms. Further
transport studies using the normal physiologic nucleoside substrate [3H]uridine showed that both CEM and CEM/20AraC cells
accumulated uridine at similar levels, whereas CEM/4AraC cells
showed no accumulation of this nucleoside (data not shown).
These results confirmed that the CEM/4AraC cells were ‘‘null’’ for
nucleoside import by hENT1/SLC29A1. On the other hand, CEM/
20AraC seemed to possess normal nucleoside transport activity
(cell surface expression, transport of [3H]uridine), although they
were highly resistant to cytotoxic concentrations of AraC and did
not accumulate [3H]AraC in uptake assays.
An alternative drug resistance mechanism in the CEM/
20AraC cells. Because CEM/20AraC cells did not harbor
mutations in the SLC29A1 gene, exhibited hENT1/SLC29A1 on
their surface, and could import [3H]uridine, additional candidate

genes were investigated. DCK is responsible for the first
modification required for metabolism of AraC. The kinase activity
of DCK was assayed in CEM, CEM/4AraC, and CEM/20AraC
cells. Although robust DCK activity was detected in CEM and
CEM/4AraC cells, it was largely absent in CEM/20AraC cells
(Fig. 5B). Cloning and sequencing the DCK cDNA from RNA of
the CEM/20AraC cells revealed two mutations (Fig. 6A). The first
corresponded to a deletion of the first six nucleotides in exon 2,
whereas the second was an insertion of 22 nucleotides at the exon 2
and exon 3 junction (Fig. 6A). To validate the mutations detected
in cDNA clones from DCK of CEM/20AraC cells, genomic DNA
fragments overlapping the exon-intron junctions of intron 1 and
exon 2, intron 2 and exon 3 were PCR-amplified, followed by
cloning and nucleotide sequencing. A single-nucleotide substitution (a!c) was identified at the splice junction of intron 1 and
exon 2 (Fig. 6B). This mutation was heterozygous and was likely
responsible for the inappropriate splicing of intron 1, including
deletion of some exon 2 sequence in the resulting mRNA/cDNA. A
second complex alteration was noted at the junction of intron 2
and exon 3 of DCK (Fig. 6C). This mutation was also heterozygous
and likely responsible for the altered splicing of exon 3. This may

have resulted in the 22-bp insertion detected in the cDNA. It is
noteworthy that both types of mutations were present in
heterozygous fashion at genomic as well as cDNA levels. These
results suggested that impaired DCK protein function was
responsible for AraC resistance in CEM/20AraC cells.

Discussion
In the present study, an AraC resistant cell line, CEM/4AraC,
was developed by continuous exposure of the CEM cell line to low
concentrations of AraC. Selection of this cell population required
several months of continuous culturing in the drug. CEM/4AraC
cells were then subcultured in increasing concentration of AraC
until a second population of highly drug resistant cells (CEM/
20AraC) was isolated and stably passaged in the presence of the
drug. The mechanism underlying drug resistance in these two cell
lines was investigated at the molecular level. The early recognition
that the drug resistance profiles of each population exhibited
significant overlap, yet were distinct with respect to 5-fluorouridine
and 5-fluoro-2¶-deoxyuridine (in which the 20 line retained
susceptibility compared with the 4 line), indicated that the two
cell populations may exhibit different mechanisms of resistance.
Extensive molecular analyses showed that AraC resistance in
CEM/4AraC cells was caused by a complete loss of function of

www.aacrjournals.org

hENT1/SLC29A1, the nucleoside transporter used by AraC as a
fraudulent substrate to enter cells. These results are based on
the identification of obvious loss-of-function mutations in the
SLC29A1 gene both at the cDNA and genomic levels and were
phenotypically translated as loss of protein expression detected by
immunoblotting and flow cytometry, lack of binding of known
hENT1/SLC29A1 ligands, drastically reduced uptake of radioactive
AraC, and cellular cross-resistance to other cytotoxic nucleoside
drugs. The observation that the two mutations were found as
heterozygotes in the CEM/4AraC cell population while no fulllength wild-type cDNA was produced suggested that each SLC29A1
gene copy had been sequentially inactivated during drug selection.
This mechanism would imply that a reduction of 50%
in activity of hENT1/SLC29A1 was sufficient to confer a selective
growth advantage in medium containing low levels of the drug
(near IC50 values). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that
silencing of a single copy of the SLC29A1 gene in leukemic cells
may provide significant cellular resistance and concomitant growth
advantage during treatment with AraC. Such biologically relevant
silencing may be difficult to detect in vivo. Previous studies
reported that lack of mRNA and/or protein expression of hENT1/
SLC29A1 is highly correlated with cellular resistance to AraC and
its close relative, gemcitabine, in both in vitro selected drugresistant cell lines and patients suffering from AML or mantle
cell lymphoma (14, 16, 38–41). Conversely, transfection of SLC29A1
cDNA into otherwise hENT1-deficient cells sensitizes cells to AraC
cytotoxicity (38). These studies support the contention that
inactivation of hENT1/SLC29A1 may cause cellular resistance to
nucleoside analogue drugs, not only in the ALL cells tested here but
also in unrelated tumor cell types. Indeed, different tumor cell
types have been shown to rely on the same molecular mechanism
to achieve resistance to cytotoxic drugs in vitro and in vivo. A
typical example is the overexpression of multidrug transporters
MDR1 (ABCB1) and MRP1 (ABCC1; for reviews, see refs. 42, 43).
Importantly, the present study is a first example of a loss-offunction mutation in the SLC29A1 gene that causes cellular
resistance to AraC.
The second cell population CEM/20AraC, loosely derived from
the 4 cell line by growth in increasing drug concentration,
displayed a mechanism of AraC resistance distinct from that found
in the 4 cells. Indeed, hENT1/SLC29A1 function was normal
in CEM/20AraC cells, including the absence of mutations in
the gene, presence at the cell surface of a protein that could
bind known hENT1/SLC29A1 ligands and capacity to transport
uridine. Instead, CEM/20AraC cells were found to carry obvious
loss-of-function mutations in the DCK gene which is absolutely
required for phosphorylation of AraC, a process necessary for
AraC-mediated inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis. The two
mutations identified were heterozygous on each of the DCK alleles
in the CEM/20AraC cells, again suggesting sequential inactivation
of the DCK gene during selection for high-level resistance to AraC.
This in turn supports the notion that partial (50%) loss of DCK
function may be sufficient to cause clinically relevant AraC
resistance. Indeed, decreased DCK expression has been associated
with increased AraC resistance in the later the phase of drug
selection in an in vitro selected human B leukemia cell line (18).
Both AraC-resistant cell lines displayed reduced levels of AraC
accumulation. In CEM/4AraC, mutations in the SLC29A1 gene
blocked cellular uptake of AraC and of other nucleoside analogue
drugs, establishing a causal relationship with cellular resistance to
these drugs. In the CEM/20AraC cell line, loss-of-function

mutations in the DCK gene explained resistance to AraC and other
nucleoside analogue drugs (e.g., gemcitabine) that are substrates for
this enzyme and hence are not phosphorylated in the resistant line.
Although these nucleoside analogue drugs can enter cells via a
functional hENT1/SLC29A1 protein, they may exit cells by the same
route in the absence of phosphorylation due to the equilibrative
nature of the transporter. On the other hand, 5-fluorouridine and 5fluoro-2¶-deoxyuridine are not substrates for DCK, can be phosphorylated by other nucleoside kinases, such as uridine kinase, and
thus remain cytotoxic to the CEM/20AraC cells.
Functional studies and sequence analysis of archival samples
corresponding to mass populations of CEM stocks frozen at
different stages of drug selection has suggested the following
scenario for the emergence of AraC resistance in the two CEM cell
lines reported herein. The first AraC-selected cell line, CEM/
4AraC, was probably a mixed population, consisting of a large
majority of cells bearing SLC29A1 mutations, and a much smaller
number of cells bearing DCK mutations (but wild type for
SLC29A1). Loss of SLC29A1 function initially imparted low-level
resistance to AraC in 4AraC cells. We speculate that loss of DCK
function conferred higher level of resistance to AraC than that
caused by loss of SLC29A1 function. Subsequent selection of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

CEM/4AraC cells in higher concentrations of AraC (e.g., 20 IC50)
caused an expansion of the DCK / cells. Further passages and/or
subcloning to generate CEM/20AraC yielded a population of
resistant cells highly enriched in DCK / cells and devoid of
SLC29A1 / cells. To test this hypothesis, we used an archival
early specimen of CEM/4AraC cells and passaged it for a period
of 3 months in 4 IC50 of AraC, and each month, a sample was
analyzed by FACS for FTH-SAENTA binding (Supplementary
Fig. S1) as an indication of hENT1/SLC29A1 surface expression.
Over this period, we observed a progressive shift from a population
that expressed little hENT1/SLC29A1 to a population that
expressed robust amounts, consistent with the notion that the
culture was being taken over by a subpopulation of highly resistant
DCK-negative cells.
DCK mutations have been previously associated with high levels
of AraC resistance in other drug selected cell lines (44, 45).
Conversely, introduction of DCK cDNA into the DCK / cells
increased cellular sensitivity to AraC and other nucleoside
analogue drugs (46–48). In addition, alternatively spliced DCK
mRNAs have been detected in leukemic blasts from patients with
resistant AML but not in sensitive AML, suggesting that these
inactive DCK mRNAs might play a role in AraC resistance in vivo

(49). These results are consistent with our findings in the CEM/
20AraC cells.
Overall, our results clearly point at hENT1/SLC29A1 and DCK as
critical players in the emergence of AraC resistance in tumor cells,
in general, and in leukemic cells, in particular. Moreover, these
findings in vitro have obvious implications for the parallel search of
other mutations in these two genes and in members of the same
pathway that can be associated with AraC resistance in vivo.
