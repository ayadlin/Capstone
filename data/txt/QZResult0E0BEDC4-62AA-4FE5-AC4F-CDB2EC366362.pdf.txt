ABSTRACT
High-throughput screening (HTS) strategies and protocols have undergone
significant development in the last decade. It is now possible to screen hundreds
of thousands of compounds, each exploring multiple biological phenotypes and
parameters, against various cell lines or model systems in a single setting. However,
given the vast amount of data such studies generate, the fact that they use multiple
reagents, and are often technician-intensive, questions have been raised about the
variability, reliability and reproducibility of HTS results. Assessments of the impact of
the multiple factors in HTS studies could arguably lead to more compelling insights
into the robustness of the results of a particular screen, as well as the overall quality
of the study. We leveraged classical, yet highly flexible, analysis of variance (ANOVA)based linear models to explore how different factors contribute to the variation
observed in a screening study of four different melanoma cell lines and 120 drugs over
nine dosages studied in two independent academic laboratories. We find that factors
such as plate effects, appropriate dosing ranges, and to a lesser extent, the laboratory
performing the screen, are significant predictors of variation in drug responses across
the cell lines. Further, we show that when sources of variation are quantified and
controlled for, they contextualize claims of inconsistencies and reveal the overall
quality of the HTS studies performed at each participating laboratory. In the context
of the broader screening study, we show that our analysis can also elucidate the
robust effects of drugs, even those within specific cell lines.

species such as Caenorhabditis elegans [2] as well as drug
response pattern identification using massive amounts of
genomic information made available for crowd-sourcing
efforts and community driven challenges [3]. HTS studies
have also been pursued to advance personalized medicine,
especially in oncology settings, since tumor-derived cell
lines can be used in the screening studies to identify
compounds that are active against them or some subset
of them. For example, large HTS databases – such as
the NCI-60 [4], the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [5]
(CCLE) and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer

High-throughput screening (HTS) strategies
allow researchers to assess the effects of thousands of
compounds on drug responses in one large experimental
setting. Over the past decade, applications of HTS for
drug discovery and drug effect characterization studies
have steadily increased, ranging from studies focusing on
the assessment of multiple phenotypic endpoints in highcontent screening [1], the evaluation of drugs on traits

[6] (GDSC) – have been made available to researchers
for the express purpose of uncovering drugs that exhibit
unique effects against tumor-generated cell lines with
specific genomic profiles. In addition, very recent work
involving the Connectivity Map [7] has exploited genetic
network and pathway reconstruction methods to identify
sets of genes that mediate specific drug responses in
subsets of cancers. In this light, the Cancer Cell Map
Initiative [8] (CCMI) and related initiatives have not only
drastically reduced drug discovery costs, but have also
guided efforts to identify genomically-informed, patientspecific cancer treatment strategies. Unfortunately, as
timely and as sophisticated as these efforts have been,
very recent studies comparing the quality of different
HTS studies meant to advance insights into personalized
cancer care have raised questions and concerns about their
reliability and reproducibility as well as the interpretation
of the data they generated [9, 10] .
Assessing the reliability of HTS studies is not trivial
given the number of compounds typically considered, the
number of reagents used, the way in which constructs
such as plating schemes and distributed robotic handlers
are set up, the manner in which dose response curves are
constructed, and the fact that different labs likely follow
slightly, if not overtly, different protocols; i.e., the sources
of HTS cells, tissues or organisms, cell culture and assay
conditions, reagents, consumables and instrumentation
are not standardized within the community. This is
particularly true for, e.g., tumor-derived cell line-based
screening studies where the nature of the source cell lines,
their procurement and sustenance as well as the responses
measured on them may vary widely between different
laboratories. In addition, although diverse in execution,
many cancer-oriented HTS studies focus on cell counts
upon stimulation with a drug that reflect that drug’s
ability to kill cells derived from a specific cell lines across
differing drug concentrations. These concentrations often
range from inducing no response (i.e., no cells are killed)
to a very strong response (e.g., all the cells are killed). The
dose ranges necessary to achieve variation in the number
of cells killed and establish a dose response curve are very
hard to anticipate, often leading to different labs using
different concentrations and numbers of concentrations.
After having established the drug concentrations
or doses to be used and applying them to cells derived
from a single cancer cell line, sigmoidal curves are often
fit to the cell counts associated with each drug dose to
generate drug-specific dose response curves (DRCs).
This is repeated for each cell line. The half minimal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) is then extracted from
these curves [4, 5]. These IC50 values, which are often
coupled with related response measures such as the area
under each dose response curve (AUC), are then used to
determine the sensitivity or resistance of each cell line to
the different drugs. Recently, the IC50 and AUC results
from two large cancer cell line HTS studies, the Cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cell Line Encyclopedia [11] (CCLE) and the Genomics
of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer [12] (GDSC) studies, were
used to assess the variability of HTS assays pursued in
this manner [7, 8]. The results of an assessment of the
comparability and reproducibility of CCLE and GDSC
data sets by two different research teams yielded opposing
interpretations, which underscores the complexity of HTS
studies and their interpreration [7, 8, 13]. A third research
team recently reevaluated the CCLE and GDSC data and
came to yet a different a conclusion [14].
In order to assess the reliability of HTS data, we
conducted a study of intra- and inter-site experimental
variability across melanoma cell lines treated with 120
different drugs that are either in use in clinical trials or
have been FDA-approved for use in treating cancers.
Our study was motivated by not only the controversies
surrounding the reliability of the CCLE and GDSC data
sets, but also by our engagement in a large clinical trial
exploring the utility of personalized treatment for latestage BRAF wild-type melanoma [15]. We first measured
variability across replicated dose and drug applications to
29 melanoma cell lines pursued within a single institution,
the Sanford Burnham Prebys (SBP) Medical Discovery
Institute in La Jolla, California. The SBP studies were
pursued using two independent HTS formats and screens:
a nine-concentration and a three-concentration doseresponse screens. Using the same 120 drugs and four
of the 29 cell lines, we performed an independent nineconcentration dose response screen at the Translational
Genomics Research Institute (TGen) in Phoenix, Arizona.
To enable analysis of inter-site experimental variability,
two copies of the master drug plates were generated at
SBP. One was then ultimately used onsite at SBP and the
other was provided to TGen for their respective screens.
Furthermore, the two sites used the same final dosing
concentrations and the same cell lines. All other aspects
of the screen were independent, resulting in variation in
the environments in the which the screens were pursued,
personnel, compound freeze/thaw cycles, cell passages,
culture conditions, plating density, actual plates and other
consumables, and instrumentation.
To analyze the data produced from the two nineconcentration HTS studies, and to assess the variability
of the results, we used flexible linear models and analysis
of variance (ANOVA) techniques. These traditional
techniques allowed us to examine how variation in drug
responses (i.e., variation in the fraction of cells killed
for a particular cell line, drug and dose) is impacted by
different factors, such as the laboratory, the drug used,
the plate on which specific assays were conducted. We
also considered interaction terms in the models (e.g.,
dose x drug interactions). We chose not to generate
dose-response curves and extract IC50 values for use in
our analyses, since our interests were in quantifying as
many sources of variation as possible and not condensing
or obscuring any of them in dose-response relationships

reflected in single derived value. Thus, we modeled the
dosage effects of each drug as a separate independent
or explanatory variable for drug response variation. It is
well-known that models that are “saturated” in that they
exhaustively model the effects of independent variables
and their interactions are inherently linear. This fact is
exploited in many contexts, most notably econometrics,
to help draw causal inferences between independent and
dependent variables [16]. Although we did not consider
all possible interaction terms in our models, we did
consider most of them. Ultimately, our linear modeling
and ANOVA analyses allowed us to make comprehensive
claims about that effects of particular drugs and dosages
on specific cell lines while accounting for factors built
into the design of the HTS, such a plate effects, that could
induce variation in drug responses. Thus, we believe our
analyses can help identify signals of truly statisticallysignificant drug effects over-and-above the “noise” created
by various factors, including individual laboratories and/
or the individual plates upon which cells were placed for
drug effect characterization. We firmly believe that more
sophisticated analytical methods, careful analyses, and
interpretations of drug effect claims in HTS experiments
are necessary and will likely lead to the identification and
characterization of correctable sources of variation that
may obscure HTS results and shed light on claims about
their lack of reproducibility.

response curve) contributed only noise to the correlations. In
addition, within each dose, the distribution of the correlation
coefficients for each drug was skewed left (Figure 2B), with
a long tail towards negative correlations. This was the same
when considering all dosages together, although there was
an observed improvement in the correlation coefficient,
which may reflect a larger sample size (Figure 2C). This
highlights the advantage of considering the overall pattern
of consistency for drug sensitivity profiles, as opposed to
considering each dose individually. Thus, studies exploring
the influence of different factors on HTS results should
pursue analyses reflecting variation in the entire experiment,
instead of just focusing on each individual drug, cell line or
dose in isolation.

Variation between two laboratories
For drugs with at least one cell line exhibiting a 20%
cell viability at higher doses, which is consistent with a
drug response (n = 46), we also calculated the Spearman
correlation coefficient between the SBP and TGen response
data for each of the nine concentrations and also across all
nine concentrations (Figure 2D, Figure 2E, Supplementary
Figure 2). The correlation coefficients across all available
dosages were greater than 0.0 in 44 out of the 46 drugs
(Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < .05 in 22 of the 44 drugs).
Individual pairwise scatterplots for each dose across the 46
drugs indicate that for a large number of them, there is a
high degree of between-laboratory consistency. As in the
three-concentration drug response analysis performed, the
drug responses were more consistent at higher doses and
across all dosages when considered together (Figure 2E,
Supplementary Figure 2). The stronger correlation at higher
dosages, especially in the context of lower doses that do not
induce an effect or response, reveal technical variation and
“noise” that should be considered in analyses seeking to
identify bona fide drug-induced effects producing signals
that rise above this experiment-wise noise. Likewise,
the improved correlation coefficients observed when
comparing the nine-concentration dose-response curves
(DRCs) against the three-concentration DRCs suggest
that a full range of DRCs may be better at revealing true
biological variation in the HTS data.

RESULTS
Variation of cell viability data across dose and
drug replicates
Table 1 provides a brief summary of the data sets
we considered in our analyses. As an initial assessment
of the consistency of drug-by-dose effects across the 29
cell lines in common between the SBP nine-concentration
and three-concentration HTS studies (Figure 1), which
comprise all HTS data obtained at matching doses within
the SBP HTS data, we considered the use of simple
correlation analyses. We found that the cell viability data
are not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk’s test p-value
< 2.2e-16 for drug responses for each drug) and that the
non-parametric Spearman correlation coefficient, rather than
the standard Pearson correlation coefficient, would be more
appropriate for use in assessing the consistency between the
two data sets. We computed pairwise Spearman correlations
for the replicates at 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μM concentrations
across each drug and cell line (Figure 2A, Supplementary
Figure 1). Additionally, we calculated the correlation
coefficients using all available concentrations. As expected,
the pairwise correlations at the three concentration points
suggested that a subset of the cell lines showed greater
evidence for reproducibility. These cell lines were identified
as those most likely to be sensitive to the drugs. This makes
sense since the cell lines exhibiting no response (i.e., does

Comprehensive analysis considering the entire
HTS experimental setting via ANOVA modeling
For a more comprehensive assessment of the factors
contributing to the variation in drug response associated
with our HTS studies, we applied flexible linear regression
modeling within an ANOVA context. We ultimately
wanted to partition the variation in cell viability data
arising from the entire HTS study into factors representing
different experimental and biological conditions (i.e.,
across all plates on which the samples were arranged,
drugs, drug concentrations, cell lines, and laboratories;

Supplementary Table 1). We limited this analysis to the four
cell lines in common at the two independent laboratories.
In order to conduct the modeling appropriately, we initially
had to choose a comparator to be contrasted with all
the other subgroupings for each of the different factors
we studied. This was achieved by creating simple zero
(absence) or one (presence) dummy variables for each factor
subgroup. We randomly selected SBP as the comparator
laboratory, Cladribine as the comparator drug, plate 36
(from the SBP experiment) as the comparator plate, cell
line A375 as the comparator cell line, and the lowest dose
(0.02 μM) as the comparator dose. Our analysis found that
the laboratory used explained 0.028% of the variation in
drug response, whereas plate (3.23%) and other biological

factors such as drugs (45.5%), concentration (5.24%), and
cell lines (4.94%) explained approximately 60% of the
variation (Table 2). To identify the individual factors that
were most statistically significant sources of variation,
we carried out simple t-tests on each factor’s regression
coefficient. We used a conservative Bonferroni-correction to
accommodate the multiple tests. The results suggested that
laboratory was only marginally significant factor relative to
the others (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 3). Analysis
of the cell lines indicated that two of the four cell lines,
MeWo and SK-MEL-2, had an effect on drug responses that
were statistically significantly different from the comparator
cell line A375. This could be due to the BRAF mutation
status in the cell lines: A375 (the comparator cell line) and

before attributing differences to the presence of the BRAF

(i.e., 2.0, 4.0, and 10.0 μM) were the most statistically
significant, consistent with the existence of overall doseresponse relationships in the experiment.

Interestingly, we also found that a large number of
SBP plates were moderately statistically different from other
plates both used at SBP and TGen; however, a single TGen
plate (plate 25) was highly significant. Furthermore, only one
SBP plate yielded a more significant t-statistic (plate 27) than
the TGen plate 25 (Supplementary Table 2). As expected,
the outlying plates produced DRCs with greater variability
(e.g., Mitoxantrone DRCs for UACC-0257 at 0.1, 1.0, and
10.0 μM for SBP plate 27 and at 0.02, 0.2, and 2.0 μM for
TGen plate 25, Figure 3B). Although plate-effects explained
3.23% of the variation in cell viability, the small number of
highly significant plates suggests that plate analysis and ways
of accommodating plate effects in HTS data analyses, or
subsequent removal of outlying plates, should be performed
to assess the overall quality of the HTS data and potentially
lead to explanations for why some drugs don’t replicate
across site-specific studies (e.g., because some plates were
outlying and should be removed as opposed to a more global
analysis and rationale). The reasons for plate effects should
be explored, but could reflect contamination, technician,
or robot error when setting up the plate or experiment in
question. Importantly, if the drugs, concentrations and
cell lines used on the plate led to biologically meaningful
effects, then one would not be able to separate the biological
significance from a potential technical artifact, which
suggests the use of controls and designed plating schemes
are necessary. Finally, we found that most drugs in the study
exhibited strong, statistically significant p-values, far beyond
what would be expected by chance alone.

cell viability) while considering other factors, we added
interaction terms to the linear models. When we accounted
for laboratory x drug interactions, we found that many of
the drugs exhibited significant interaction term p-values;
in fact many more than would be expected by chance
alone. These results indicate that although drugs may
influence variation in cell viability across the experiment
as a whole, some of the cell viability variation may be
laboratory-specific (Supplementary Table 3). 19 drugs
yielded significant drug p-values, yet non-significant druglaboratory interaction effects (Figure 3C, Supplementary
Figure 4), indicating that these drugs exhibited overtly
reproducible effects (Supplementary Table 4). As expected,
when we incorporated the drug x dose interaction terms
into our analysis models, we found that a majority of the
variation significantly accounted for by dose was limited
to higher concentrations, which of course makes sense
(Supplementary Figure 5). Importantly, drug x laboratory
interaction effects only explained an additional 3.94% of
the cell viability variation, whereas drug x dose interaction
effects explained an additional 11.02% of the variation in
cell viability.
The consideration of three-way interaction effects
led to additional insights into the factors contributing to
cell viability in a pronounced enough way to rise above
the “noise” in cell viability across the HTS experiments
as a whole. Laboratory × drug x dose effects explained
2.5% of cell viability variance and drug x dose x cell line
explained 3.6% of the variance (Supplementary Table 5).
These findings provided further evidence that laboratory
effects were not as influential on the experiment as a whole
relative to other factors. While nine drugs appeared to have
laboratory-specific effects (i.e., a non-significant effect
when considering the drug alone, but a significant drug

had the largest impact on the drug-associated cell viability,
which it to be expected (Supplementary Figure 6). Again,
we identified a subset of drug x dose x cell line interaction
terms that were significant (Supplementary Table 6),
suggesting that there may be some heterogeneity among
the cell lines (likely due to genetic differences) affecting
the drug response. This is important in that it suggests
unique cell-line features may indicate efficacy of certain
drugs, which is consistent with the goal of personalized
medicine. The significant differences in cell viability
across the cell lines generally appear in the intermediate
concentration ranges (Supplementary Figure 7).

selected the drug-cell line pairs where the constant model
fit the data the best based on the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC), since this would be indicative of no
evidence of a drug or dose-dependent response. The set of
drug x cell line combinations that suggested no evidence
for a drug or dose-dependent response was then used as the
comparator group in a re-analysis of the cell viability data.
The re-analysis suggested that the laboratory in which
the assays were done explained a minimal proportion of
the variance (0.03%). However, drug effects explained
41.2%, dose 5.24%, cell line 4.94%, and plates 3.23%
of the variation in cell viability across the experiment
(Supplementary Table 7). Interestingly, this re-analysis
greatly reduced the number of statistically significant
drug effects, suggesting that only a small subset of drugs
studied may be exhibiting actual effects that rise above the
“noise” in cell viability across the experimental setting as
a whole (Supplementary Figures 8–11 and Supplementary
Tables 7–10).

Re-analysis with a broader set of comparator
drugs and cell lines
To investigate whether the use of an arbitrary drug
as the comparator drug impacted our initial analyses in
any way, we set out to identify a group of cell line and
drug combinations that did not exhibit any dose-response
or general drug effect. These combinations would then
effectively act as a group of controls whose cell viabilities
represent simple noise and technical variation when
compared to the other cell line-drug combinations. These
analyses would allow us to see if compelling drug or drug
x cell line effects can be identified that rise above the noise
and variation exhibited in the HTS experiment as a whole.
As noted in the Methods section, we fit a three-parameter
sigmoidal, a four-parameter sigmoidal, a linear, and a

the site, plate and dose effects were considered in the
model, we found 44 drugs with drug effect p-values that
surpassed Bonferroni-adjusted significance thresholds
(Supplementary Table 11). Strikingly, only 28 of the
44 drugs (64%) resulting from these analyses were in
common, further confirming that experimental factors

DISCUSSION
Although there has been a considerable amount of
interest and development in HTS technologies, there have
been few attempts at standardizing protocols and ensuring
the reliability and reproducibility of the resulting data.
Many sources of variation implicated in HTS studies, such
as the laboratory used to pursue the experiment, technicians,
reagents and version of reagents used, plating schemes, cell
culture conditions and dosing ranges, will inevitably have
an effect on the resulting data. However, properly recording
and accommodating these factors in the analysis of HTS
data can aide in not only an assessment of the quality of the
data, but also the interpretation of the results.
We sought to quantify the sources of variability
in an HTS setting in order to gauge the, reliability and
reproducibility of the resulting data. We did this using
HTS data from a study on melanoma cell lines and simple
correlation analyses coupled with often-used ANOVA
modeling methods. The methods we discussed and applied
can be used with any HTS data set including many of
those in the public domain, although many studies have
either used methods like we have proposed or different

Analysis of CCLE and GDSC data
We used ANOVA analyses on IC50 values provided
in the CCLE and GDSC data sets along with our SBP and
TGen data on the four cell lines and six common drugs
they had in common. In these models, we randomly
selected CCLE as the comparator laboratory, the drug
Crizotinib as the comparator drug, and cell line A375 as
the comparator cell line. Similar to the analysis comparing
the raw SBP and TGen data, we found that laboratories
were not significant predictors of IC50 values when we
also accommodated drug, cell line, and laboratory effects
in the model. We note, however, that we did observe

generation sequencing, reverse phase protein arrays, etc.).
Using the ANOVA setting, we, for example, identified
evidence that certain plates used in the experiment were
problematic and thus could undermine the reliability of the
HTS experiment as whole if not accounted for properly.
We chose not to construct dose-response curves
(DRCs) for each cell line for each drug and then compare,
e.g., IC50 values extracted from those curves across sites
or among different conditions, since this would ultimately
ignore variation introduced by different technical factors
impacting dose effects on cell viability (e.g., plate effects)
and hence the DRCs. In this context, once outlying
plates have been identified, it is possible to reassess the
reliability of the HTS data using the traditional methods
while excluding those outlying plates (alternatively,
one could obtain coefficients associated with significant
experimental effects and weight them accordingly).
Additionally, ANOVA methodology allows for the
simultaneous analysis of all cell viability data across all
drugs to identify true and very compelling signals that
have been obtained in a HTS experiment. Although the
specific plating scheme in our experiments (Figure 1)
allowed for the simultaneous analysis of various factors,
it could also lead to confounding effects between plate and
dose because triplicate concentrations were constrained
to individual plates (i.e., one of three concentrations
sets were used for each plate: concentrations 1, 4, and 7;
concentrations 2, 5, and 8; and concentrations 3, 6, and 9).
In terms of specific findings, we observed that
laboratory effects only explained a small fraction (0.03%)
of the cell viability variation in our HTS setting. This
contrasts with the results of studies described in recent
publications about the reliability of the data associated
with two very large cancer cell line screens pursued by
different groups at different sites [5, 6, 8, 9]. We also
observed that the main source of variation in our study
could be attributed to the drugs used–further indicating
that in certain settings, HTS data may indeed be reliable.
By considering site x drug interactions in our analyses,
we identified drugs with reproducible effects. Our
consideration of three-way interaction terms allowed us to
identify some heterogeneity among the cell line response
to drugs, suggesting that genetic differences among cell
lines may explain why some cell lines are responsive
to certain drugs. This is consistent with the notion that
in vitro drug screening can shed light on the potential
for personalized medicine [17]. We also find that the
downstream analyses of drug association tests are greatly
impacted by whether one accommodates or does not
accommodate experimental and technical factors, such
a plating scheme, in the analysis models. In this light,
we found that many of the drugs identified without
experimental factors were false positives. Similarly, we
find that many drugs that were significantly associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with drug response were missed when the models did
not accommodate experimental factors. Our experience
suggests that interaction terms in ANOVA-like analysis
settings should be considered in order to tease out
important and compelling drug associations that would
otherwise go undetected due to the masking of particular
drug effects by “noise.”
Ultimately, assessing the variability, reliability and
reproducibility of HTS data by designing the study to
contrast different experimental conditions could add to the
overall experimental costs. As a result, alternative methods
that can account for sources of variation are needed. Our
analysis at the very least highlights the importance of
using consistent dosing and plating schemes that include
specific controls, which would allow researchers to not
only measure and test for the impact of experimental
factors on the outcomes, but also adjust for these specific
experimental effects when making claims about, e.g.,
drug and cell-line specific effects. Thus, ANOVA-like
methods can accommodate different experimental factors
that may influence the HTS assays in pronounced ways
and also reveal compelling signals attributable to drugs
and experimental compounds. Although our analysis was
performed only within the context of melanoma, and,
importantly, only within the context of four melanoma cell
lines and 120 drugs, our overall ANOVA-based approach
can be used to reassess the quality of publicly available
data as well as additional HTS data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
We initially performed a nine-concentration (i.e.,
dose) HTS study (drug concentrations: 0.02, 0.04, 0.1, 0.2,
0.4, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 10.0 μM) on 40 melanoma cell lines
across 120 drugs (Table 1) at Sanford Burnham Prebys
Medical Discovery Institute (SBP). We used 384-well
plates with three concentrations of a drug assigned to each
plate across all 120 drugs in triplicate (Figure 1). Drugs
were spotted on 384-well clear bottom tissue culture treated
plates (Greiner Bio-One, #781098) using an Echo Liquid
Handler (Labcyte Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) such that addition of
25 µLs of cells (100 k cells/mL in RPMI + 10% FBS +Pen./
Strep./ Glut., Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA) resulted
in the above described final drug concentrations and
2.5 k cells/well. Upon plating, the cells were gently spun
down at 1 k rpm for one minute and incubated with drugs
for 96 hours at 37oC in a standard tissue culture incubator.
After this time course, plates were allowed to equilibrate to
room temperature for 30 minutes before 10 µLs per well
of freshly prepared CellTiterGlo reagent (G7571, Promega
Corp., Madison WI) were added. Samples were incubated
for ten minutes with gentle agitation (100 rpm) before
luminescence was read on a BioTek Synergy2 plate reader
using Gen5 software (BioTek, Winooski, VT).

Each plate was assayed in triplicate and included
24 vehicle only DMSO controls. In total, nine plates
were used for each cell line. For each cell line, drug,
and drug concentration combination, cell viability (CV)
measures were obtained post drug administration and were
normalized to the plate-specific average DMSO cell:
CVnorm =

each experimental pair setting at each dose (i.e., single
concentration pairs) and the correlation coefficient across
all available doses (i.e., all three-concentration doses when
comparing the two SBP screens or all nine-concentration
doses when comparing SBP and TGen screens). Since
the Spearman correlation is robust to outliers, is nonparametric, and does not necessarily assume linear
relationships, we chose use it as implemented in base stats
package [18] in R. We assessed the normality of the data
using Shapiro-Wilk test in the base stat package [11] for R
For a more comprehensive assessment of the assays’
variability and reliability on the four common cell lines
across institutes, we used flexible linear models and
ANOVA (also within the base stats [11] package in R)
to simultaneously assess drug effects (across all drugs)
as well as all other experimental (e.g., plate and lab) and
biological (e.g., drug, dose, and cell line) factor effects
by creating (0, 1) dummy variables for each factor (e.g.,
we had 120–1 = 119 dummy variables for the drugs,
9–1 = 8 for doses, 4–1 = 3 for cell lines, 72–1 = 71 for
plates, and one for site). After combining the lab, plate,
drug, dose, and cell line factors, there were a total of 202
factor effects. Notably, we performed a multi-factorial
analysis in an unbalanced experimental design. Under
this approach, ANOVA in the context of linear regression
models was used to assess the proportion of variation that
can be attributed to each factor (e.g., laboratory, plate,
drug, dose, and cell line). Interaction terms between
the factors were also used to assess the non-additive
influence and combinations of different factors. We then
fit dose-response curves (DRCs) to each of the SBP and
TGen nine-concentration HTS experiments using four
separate models: a four-parameter sigmoidal model, a
three-parameter sigmoidal model, a linear model, and a
constant model (i.e., no dose-response effect). We fit these
DRCs using the nplr [19] package in R. We used the
Akaike Information Criterion [20] (AIC) from the base
stats [11] package in R to identify the “best” model for
each cell line and drug combination. The AIC provides
an assessment of model performance while considering
the number of parameters used for the model. Thus, this
approach allowed us to assess the fit of each model while
adjusting for the number of parameters assumed within
those models. We did this to identify individual drugs that
exhibited no evidence of a dose-response relationship. The
drugs and cell lines that exhibited no evidence of a dose
response effect were then treated as a set of “controls”
for the other drugs because the variation they exhibited
across the different doses reflect noise-induced and
technical variation. We used this set of control drugcell line combinations in re-analysis with the ANOVA
model, coding the controls as the baseline drug (i.e. for
the “controls”, binary variables for each drug were set to
0 in the model). To evaluate the impact of controlling for
plate-specific effects, we performed drug association tests
using linear models with interaction terms. We compared

We also pursued an independent
  three-concentration
HTS study (drug concentrations: 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 μM) at
SBP across 30 melanoma cell lines (29 in common with
the nine-point screen) on all 120 drugs as described above.
Finally, we performed the primary nine-concentration HTS
study across all 120 drugs for four melanoma cell lines
in common with the initial nine-point SBP screen (four
screened cell lines: UACC-0257, MeWo, SK-Mel-2, and
A375) at the Translational Genomics Research Institute
(TGen). For the TGen HTS study, the experimental
protocols were similar to the SBP screen, with minor
differences. Specifically, the compounds were pre-spotted
to white, solid-bottom 384-well assay plates (Greiner BioOne) using ATS (Biosero, San Diego, CA). Additionally,
prior to measuring the luminescence using an Analyst GT
plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), 25 uL
CellTiterGlo reagent (G7571, Promega Corp., Madison WI)
was added to assay plates and incubated at room temperature
for one hour (as opposed to ten minutes at SBP).
MeWo and A-375 cell lines were obtained directly
from American Type Culture Collection, all SK- cell lines
were received directly from Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center, TGen generated all UACC- cell lines, and
all were of low passage number. Cells were maintained
according to the manufacturer's or collaborator’s
instructions: A-375 cells are grown using DMEM
medium, MeWo and Sk-Mel-2 cells are grown using
EMEM medium, and UACC-0257 cells are grown using
RPMI1640 medium. All media have 10% FBS and 1%AA
added to final growth media. All cell lines were banked at
low passages in multiple aliquots as liquid nitrogen stocks
to reduce risk of phenotypic drift. All cells were cultured
for less than three months before reinitiating culture from
the frozen stock. All cells were routinely inspected for
identity by morphology and growth curve analysis and
validated to be mycoplasma free. All cell lines were free
of contaminants.

Data analysis
We assessed the variability of the HTS data by first
examining the correlations between measures obtained
at matching doses using the two SBP screens (i.e., nineconcentration and three-concentration screens) and then
across the SBP and TGen screens (i.e., the two nineconcentration screens). We calculated the Spearman
correlation of the CVnorm between the data obtained from
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

models that included and excluded plate effects. The
significance of each drug’s effects in the context of the
entire experiment was determined based on a Bonferroniadjusted [21] significance threshold.
Because we were unable to access the raw
experimental data for the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(CCLE) data, we explored the consistency of the IC50
values provided from the CCLE [5] repository along
with IC50 values from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity
in Cancer [6] (GDSC) data repository. We also computed
the IC50 values from our SBP and TGen data using threeparameter sigmoidal curve fits. The four cell lines in
common between the SBP and TGen data sets were also
available for the CCLE and GDSC data, but only six drugs
were in common. Further, replicates were only available
in the GDSC dataset, plating schemes used between the
sites were inconsistent, and there were differences in
dose-concentrations between same cell line and drug
combinations from the various datasets. Nevertheless, we
explored the variation in the HTS data using information
on the different sites (n = 4), cell lines (n = 4), and drugs
(n = 6). All analyses were performed in R and all figures
were generated using the graphics11 package in R.
