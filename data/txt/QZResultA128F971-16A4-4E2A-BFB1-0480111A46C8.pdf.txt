ABSTRACT
Afatinib is a second-generation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase inhibitor and has shown a significant clinical benefit in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR-activating mutations. However, the
potential therapeutic effects of afatinib combining with other modalities, including
ionizing radiation (IR), are not well understood. In this study, we developed a
gefitinib-resistant cell subline (PC-9-GR) with a secondary EGFR mutation (T790M)
from NSCLC PC-9 cells after chronic exposures to increasing doses of gefitinib. The
presence of afatinib significantly increases the cell killing effect of radiation in PC-9GR cells harboring acquired T790M, but not in H1975 cells with de novo T790M or in
H460 cells that express wild-type EGFR. In PC-9-GR cells, afatinib remarkable blocks
baseline of EGFR and ERK phosphorylations, and causes delay of IR-induced AKT
phosphorylation. Afatinib treatment also leads to increased apoptosis and suppressed
DNA damage repair in irradiated PC-9-GR cells, and enhanced tumor growth inhibition
when combined with IR in PC-9-GR xenografts. Our findings suggest a potential
therapeutic impact of afatinib as a radiation sensitizer in lung cancer cells harboring
acquired T790M mutation, providing a rationale for a clinical trial with combination
of afatinib and radiation in NSCLCs with EGFR T790M mutation.

INTRODUCTION

cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [3]. However, acquired TKI
resistance remains to be a major problem for therapeutic
failure, which ultimately develops in most of the patients
treated with reversible first-generation of TKI for 10 to 16
months, and almost 50% of cases are caused by acquired
or de novo T790M mutation [4-6]. For these patients with
re-progressed tumors with developed TKIs-resistance,
treatments with second-line chemotherapeutic agents such
as XL-647 [7], dasatinib [8], and neratinib [9] also failed
to show obvious improvement of clinical outcomes.
Afatinib is a second-generation of EGFR-TKI, with
highly selective inhibition on activations of EGFR, HER2,
and HER4 [10, 11]. The irreversible, covalent binding of
afatinib leads to longer suppression of receptor kinase

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality in the world [1]. Despite the advances in the
diagnosis and treatment, the overall survival of this
disease remains disappointing, and 5-year survival rate
is approximately 15% [2]. Novel therapeutic strategies
are thus needed for further improvement of clinical
outcomes. In past decades, the identification of mutations
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that result
in constitutive activation, and their association with
significant responses to chemotherapeutic tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) have led to new paradigm of molecular
targeting therapeutic strategy for patients with non-small

activity when compared to first-generation of EGFRTKIs such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Afatinib has been
clinically evaluated in the LUX-Lung series of trials, and
has been reported to increase progression-free survival
in patients with EGFR-activating mutations as both firstand second/third-line therapies [12, 13]. It has also been
reported to effectively decrease the cell proliferation rates
of NSCLC cell lines expressing T790M mutation and
showed therapeutic potential in xenograft of murine lung
tumor with EGFR L858R/790M double mutations [10].
Of interest, the phase II trial LUX-Lung 4 demonstrated
the modest but notable activity of afatinib in patients who
developed acquired resistance to erlotinib, gefitinib or
both [13]. These results indicate a potential of afatinib
be one of the most promising therapeutic agents against
NSCLC tumors with exon19 deletion, exon21 L858R and/
or exon20 T790M mutations in EGFR gene.
In this study, we tested a hypothesis that afatinib
may also act as a potential radiosensitizing agent in
NSCLC cells with acquired gefitinib resistance. Our

results showed that afatinib could significantly increase
the clonogenic cell death in response to radiotherapy
in established gefitinib-resistance human lung cancer
cell PC-9-GR subline bearing EGFR 19Del/T790M
double mutations in vitro, and enhance the tumor growth
inhibition in xenografts model.

RESULTS
Development of gefitinib-resistant PC-9-GR cells
In this study, we first used stepwise exposure to
increasing concentrations of gefitinib to establish gefitinibresistant lung cancer cells. For this, PC-9 cells were first
treated with 8 nM of gefitinib, a dose equivalent to IC30 in
parental PC-9, and were then exposed to increased doses
of gefitinib until 8.0μM.
Previous studies have reported a secondary EGFR

deletion was included as positive control in these assays.

mutation at nucleotide 2369 in exon 20, which leads to
a substitution of methionine for threonine at position
790 (T790M), in established gefitinib-resistance NSCLC
cell lines, and in patients with acquired resistance after
gefitinib treatment [14, 15]. We thus examined the
potential emergency of EGFR T790M mutation in PC-9
cells during the chronic exposure to gefitinib. We detected
EGFR T790M mutation with a assay of amplification
refractory mutation system (ARMS) with sensitivity up
to 0.1% in cells exposed to gefitinib for 48 days, which
was further confirmed in cells treated with gefitinib for 70
days (Figure 1A).
Cells survived in the exposure to 8.0μM gefitinib
were then subcloned, and direct sequencing for EGFR
T790M mutation was performed in eleven selected
clones. Of them, we found that six clones (near 50%)
have detectable EGFR T790M mutation. A sub-clone with
stable resistance to gefitinib and persistent EGFR T790M
mutation was selected as established gefitinib-resistant
subline (PC-9-GR).
With MTS assay, we found that the IC50 for

gefitinib was 8.6 μM in PC-9-GR cells, which was about
680-fold higher than that in parental PC-9 cells (12.5 nM).
No obvious morphologic change was observed in PC-9GR cells comparing to PC-9 cells. We further noticed that
maintenance in regular medium without gefitinib for >1
year did not change the decreased sensitivity to gefitinib
of PC-9-GR cells (Figure 1B). However, we observed
slight changes in cell cycle distribution in PC-9-GR cells.
The cell growth analysis also showed that PC-9-GR has
relatively slow growth kinetics, with longer cell doubling
time (41.0 ± 3.1 vs 31.9 ± 3.3 hours), when compared to
that of PC-9 cells (Supplementary Figure S1).
During the maintenance (>1 year) in drug-free
medium, we detected the persistence of the EGFR
T790M mutation, as well as the original 15 bp deletion
of EGFR gene resulted from parental PC-9 cells, in PC9-GR cells (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S2). No
other mutation in the exons (exons 18-21) encoding the
cytoplasmic region of the EGFR was detected in PC-9GR cells.

(Figure 2).
To evaluate potential radiosensitization effects
of afatinib in these NSCLC cell lines, we determined
the Sensitization Enhancement Ratio (SER) for
clonogenic survival. In this study, cells were pretreated
with corresponding IC50 values of afatinib and then
irradiated. Our results showed that pretreatment with
350.0 nM of afatinib enhanced radiosensitivity of PC-9GR cells (SER=1.22; P<0.0001). However, no obvious
radiosensitization effects of afatinib were observed
in H460 (SER=1.07), H1975 (SER=0.97), and PC-9
(SER=1.07) cells when exposed to corresponding IC50
values (Figure 3). Interestingly, we noticed that SER
value for PC-9 cells was 1.22 (P<0.0001, Table 1)
when cells were pretreated with afatinib at higher dose
(2.8 nM, equivalent to 10×IC50), suggesting a potential
radiosensitization effect of afatinib in a dose-dependent
manner in PC-9 cells. Notably, higher SER values for PC9-GR cells can also be reached when cells were pretreated
with 1.75 μM (5×IC50, SER=1.41) or 3.5 μM (10×IC50,
SER=1.50) of afatinib (P<0.0001) (Table 1). Interestingly,
we did not observe radiosensitization effects of afatinib

We next tested the sensitivities of PC-9 and PC-9GR cells to afatinib treatment. For this, we determined the
IC50 values of afatinib in these cells. We also evaluated
IC50 values for afatinib in gefitinib-resistant human lung
cancer H1975 cells carrying de novo T790M mutation,
and in H460 cells which express wild-type of EGFR
but carrying KRAS mutation which leads to gefitinib
resistance. We found that IC50 values were 0.28 nM
for PC-9, 350.0 nM for PC-9-GR, 38.4nM for H1975
and 2.3μM for H460 cells, respectively. These results
suggest that NSCLC cells with T790M mutant EGFR are
relatively sensitive to afatinib than cells carrying wild-type
EGFR, which is consistent with the reports from previous
study [16]. Of note, we found that IC50 value of PC-9-GR
cells were significantly higher than that of parental PC-9
cells, indicating that development of acquired resistance
to gefitinib, or to other first-generation of TKIs, may also
cause reduced sensitivity to second-generation of TKIs in
NSCLC cells that were initially sensitive to these agents

Effects of afatinib on activations of EGFR, AKT
and ERK proteins in NSCLC cells expressing
T790M mutant EGFR in response to ionizing
radiation treatment

in H1975 cells even if cells were pretreated with higher
concentration of afatinib (10×of corresponding IC50),
although H1975 cells harbor EGFR T790M mutation
and are sensitive to afatinib treatment. Because the
concentrations of afatinib at doses of 11.5μM (5×IC50)
and 23.0μM (10×IC50) are not clinical achievable, we did
not test them for SERs in H460 cells. Nevertheless, these
results suggest that afatinib may induce radiosensitizations
in NSCLC cells carrying EGFR activating mutation and
with acquired gefitinib-resistance.

It has been reported that receptor tyrosine kinases
and AKT signaling are activated by irradiation in NSCLC
cells [17-19]. To investigate whether treatment of
afatinib can affect these activations, we treated cells with
corresponding IC50 of afatinib combined with 6 Gy of
ionizing radiation (IR). We found that the phosphorylation

levels of EGFR, AKT and ERK increased after IR in PC9, PC-9-GR and H1975 cells. Pretreatment with afatinib
remarkable blocked basal level of the phosphorylations
of EGFR and ERK proteins, and caused delays of IRinduced phosphorylation of AKT in these cells (Figure
4A-D and Supplementary Figure S3). However, we found
that afatinib exposure did not cause changes of the basal
phosphorylation levels for EGFR, AKT and ERK proteins
in H460 cells (Supplementary Figure S3). The results
from RTK array assays further showed that additional
phosphorylation of c-Met was activated in H1975 cells,
but not in PC-9 and PC-9-GR cells, after 2 hours with 6
Gy IR combined with afatinib (Figure 4E).

found that knocking-down of DNA-pKcs with siRNA
transfection eliminated the radiosensitization effect of
afatinib in PC-9-GR cells (Figure 5E). Thus, our results
indicate a potential that afatinib exposure can cause
persistence of lethal DNA damage with reduced NHEJ
repair capability for IR-induced DNA DSBs, through
modulation of DNA-pKcs expression.

Combination of afatinib and radiation therapy
inhibits tumor growth in PC-9-GR xenograft
We further extended our study to an in vivo model.
For this, PC-9-GR cells were inoculated into Nu/Nu mice
to establish xenografts, and the effects of afatinib, IR or
afatinib combined with IR on tumor growth were then
assessed. Our results showed that treatment with single
dose of IR (10 Gy) or daily oral treatment with afatinib
(20mg/kg for 14 days) could inhibit in vivo PC-9-GR
tumor growth with TGI of 38.4% and 46.9% respectively.
However, we found that combination treatment of
IR with afatinib caused significantly enhanced tumor
growth inhibition with TGI of 71.1% (Figure 6A).
In this experiment, we also measured the mice body
weight to assess the tolerability of systemic therapies,
and no obvious body weight changes were observed
(Supplementary Figure S4), suggesting that treatment of
IR combining with afatinib is well tolerable.
In a parallel experiment, we tested the changes of
EGFR phosphorylation, expressions of molecular markers
for cell proliferation (Ki-67) and apoptosis (cleavage of
caspase 3), the presences of γ-H2AX and expression of
DNA-pKcs in tumor tissues collected after treatments
with immunohistochemistry analysis. Our data showed
that afatinib suppressed phosphorylation of EGFR, even
in cells where EGFR phosphorylation was enhanced by
IR treatment; when compared to treatment with IR or
afatinib alone, combined treatment of IR and afatinib
increased the positive staining of cleaved caspase 3 (CC3)
with statistical significance. We also noticed that, although
treatment with IR or afatinib alone reduced staining of
Ki67 in PC-9-GR tumors, combination treatment further
decreased the level of positive staining for Ki67 in tumors
tissues. Exposure to afatinib also suppressed IR-induced
elevations of γ-H2AX foci formation and reduced DNApKcs expression in these tumor tissues (Figure 6B and
Supplementary Table 1).
Taken together, our data suggest that afatinib can
sensitize in vivo PC-9-GR tumor to radiation therapy.

Afatinib enhances IR-induced apoptosis and
causes DNA damage repair delay in PC-9-GR
cells through reduced DNA-pKcs expression
We next assessed the effects of afatinib on IRinduced apoptosis in PC-9-GR cells. As shown in Figure
5A, combination treatment of afatinib and IR induced
significantly higher percentage (29.8%) of total apoptosis
when compared to that in cells treated with afatinib or IR
alone (13.4% and 16.0%, respectively). We also found
that the presence of pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk can
effectively block the enhancement of apoptosis induced by
afatinib in irradiated cells (Figure 5B).
IR-induced DNA double stand breaks (DSBs) is
followed by γ-H2AX foci formation and recruitment of
DNA-PK factors to sites of DSBs [20]. To test whether
exposure to afatinib could affect DNA damage repair
in irradiated cells, we determined the kinetic changes
of γ-H2AX foci in PC-9-GR cells in response to IR
treatment (Figure 5C). We found that cell fractions with
discrete nuclear γ-H2AX foci dramatically increased
(to 85%±8.2%) within 2 hour after 6 Gy of IR, and then
dropped. By 36 hours post-IR, the percentage of cells
with residual γ-H2A.X foci was 27%±5.1%. Exposure
to afatinib did not cause obvious changes of baseline
γ-H2AX foci formation. However, pretreatment with
afatinib led to slightly increase of the formation of
γ-H2AX foci (to 93%±11.3%) in cells after IR-exposure
for 2 hours, and the number of cells with residual
-H2A.X foci after 36 hours in these irradiated cells
remained statistically higher at 45%±4.7%.
Previous study demonstrated that treatment with
gefitinib could modulate the association of EGFR and
DNA-pKcs leading to repressed function of DNA-pKcs
[21]. We also found that treatment with afatinib blocked
the increased expression of DNA-pKcs in PC-9-GR cells
in response to IR (Figure 5D), indicating a potential
involvement of NHEJ (non-homologous end-joining)
repair pathway in cells treated with the combination of
afatinib and IR. We thus tested the role of DNA-pKcs on
afatinib-induced radiosensitization in PC-9-GR cells. We

neoangiogenesis. Thus, the mutated EGFR that lead to
constitutive activation of EGFR signaling is oncogenic and
is therefore attractive as a cancer therapeutic molecular
target. Indeed, NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation
can gain clinical benefit from EGFR TKIs as therapeutic
agents. In addition, EGFR has been reported to play a role
in the DNA damage response to radiation therapy [22, 23].
Following this, EGFR-TKIs have been reported to act as
radiosensitizers in NSCLC and other cancers [24, 25].
Although the NSCLC tumors carrying mutated
EGFR display significant responses (as high as 80%) to

EGFR-TKIs, the cancer cells eventually become resistant
to the treatment and median duration of response is
about 10 to 16 months [6, 26]. Several mechanisms for
the acquired resistance to these EGFR-TKIs have been
identified, including a secondary EGFR mutation of
T790M [14]. Previous studies demonstrated the emergence
of T790M mutation in EGFR gene in established NSCLC
cell lines with acquired gefitinib-resistance and in patients
with prolonged treatment with EGFR-TKIs [27-29]. In
this study, we also detected emergency of EGFR T790M
mutation in NSCLC PC-9 cells exposed to chronic

treatment of gefitinib, and in the established gefitinibresistant PC-9-GR cells.
In NSCLC cells with initial EGFR-L858R mutation,
the presence of secondary T790M mutation was found
to affect the binding of gefitinib to mutated EGFR,
with increased affinity of L858-T790M-EGFR to ATP
when compared to L858 alone [30]. However, detailed
mechanisms of how T790M affects the activation of
mutated EGFR are still not clear. On the other hand,
debate exists in regard to the selection or acquisition of
this T790M mutation in EGFR gene in re-progressed
cancer cells after treatment with EGFR-TKIs. Several
studies suggested that T790M mutation was acquired only
after exposure to EGFR-TKIs because pre-progression
samples lacked T790M [31, 32]. Other reports, however,
have indicated that T790M is not uncommon in tumors of
TKI-naive patients with mutant EGFR, and clones with
this alteration are selected for survival after treatment
with EGFR-TKIs [9, 15, 33]. Nevertheless, this secondary
T790M mutation negates the hypersensitivity of activated
EGFR to EGFR-TKIs and generates high-grade resistance
to achievable clinical doses of EGFR-TKIs.
Afatinib is the first irreversible ErbB Family
Blocker, approved in the U.S, Europe, Taiwan and
Mexico for use in patients with EGFR mutation-positive
NSCLC. Unlike first generation of EGFR-TKIs, the
irreversible binding of afatinib, which lead to combined
inhibitions of ErbB family signaling, aims to provide a
sustained, selective, covalent and complete ErbB family
blockade. Afatinib has showed the preclinical activity in
tumor models with EGFR-TKI resistant mutation T790M.
A phase I/II trial (LUX-Lung 4) reported prolonged
progression-free survival (PFS) for patients treated with
afatinib when compared to the groups treated with either
gefitinib or erlotinib [13]. Most interestingly, afatinib
monotherapy or combination therapy has shown activity in
patients with advanced NSCLC that had failed on previous
treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib [10, 34]. Thus, afatinib
may provide the potential benefits for NSCLC patients
with mutant EGFR, when compared to first-generation
EGFR-TKIs.
In this study, we investigated the effects of afatinib
on mutant EGFR-bearing NSCLC cells with acquired
gefitinib resistance in response to radiotherapy. Our results
showed that the emergency of a secondary EGFR mutation,
T790M, during the chronic exposure to gefitinib in PC-9
cells and in the consequently established gefitinib-resistant
PC-9-GR subline cells. We also demonstrated in this study
that afatinib could induce synergistic radiosensitization
in PC-9-GR cells. The observed enhancements of tumor
growth suppression and of irradiation-induced apoptosis in
xenografts further supported the radiosensitization effect
of afatinib in gefitinib-resistant PC-9-GR cells. To our best
knowledge, this is the first study showing the combined
effects of afatinib and radiotherapy in lung cancer cells
with acquired EGFR-TKI resistance.

Radiation therapy is a key modality in the treatment
of lung cancer. Although the molecular basis of radiation
response is complex and multifactorial, the predominant
mechanism by which therapeutic irradiation kills most
tumor cells is through clonogenic death. DSBs are
regarded as the specific lesions and main cause that
initiates this lethal response and the repair of DSBs is
then critical in determining radiosensitivity [35, 36].
Enhanced presences of γ-H2AX foci have been found
in bladder cancer [37], human squamous cell carcinoma
[38] and NSCLC cancer cells [39] treated with IR in
the presence of TKIs, including afatinib. In PC-9-GR
cells, pretreatment with afatinib also leads to increase
and persistence of γ-H2AX foci in irradiated cells, and
knocking-down of DNA-pKcs eliminates afatinib-induced
radiosensitization. These results indicate that afatinib
may affect the interaction of EGFR and DNA-pKcs [21],
leading to NHEJ inhibition on DNA damage repair, in PC9-GR cells in response to IR.
Previous study reported that combination treatment
of irradiation and gefitinib had additive cell killing effects
in activating EGFR mutations-bearing PC-9 and HCC827
cells [39]. In this study, we noticed that afatinib could
sensitize PC-9 cells to IR when cells were exposed to
relatively higher concentrations of afatinib. However,
although H1975 cells carry EGFR mutation, and are
relatively more sensitive to IR treatment alone when
compared to PC-9-GR, no radiosensitization effects of
afatinib were observed even if the cells were pretreated
with afatinib at higher dose of 10×IC50. Of note, data
from a previous study indicated that gefitinib could
induce sensitivity in PC-9 cells, but not in H1975 cells
[40], and combination of afatinib and c-Met inhibitor
could enhance growth inhibition, apoptosis induction and
inhibition of downstream signaling (including p-ERK [41,
42]) in H1975 cells [43-45]. Indeed, our results showed
that c-Met was activated in H1975 cells after treatment
of IR combining with afatinib. It is therefore possible that
c-Met also plays important roles in cells in response to the
combination treatment of IR and afatinib, and activation of
c-MET may thus block afatinib-induced radiosensitization
in H1975 cells. Further investigation is thus needed to test
this hypothesis.
In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time
the in vitro and in vivo radiosensitization activities of
afatinib in NSCLC cells with acquired gefitinib resistance.
The data presented here suggest a potential clinic impact
for use of afatinib as a part of radiotherapy regimen for
NSCLC, and patients with acquired EGFR-TKI resistance
may be further benefited from this therapeutic strategy.

manufacturer’s instruction . Briefly, cells were plated in
96-well plate (3000 cells/well). 24 hours later after plating,
cells were treated with various concentration of afatinib,
and cell viability was then determined 72 hours later.

Cell culture and reagents
The human NSCLC PC-9, NCI-H1975 and
NCI-H460 cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). These cells were
maintained in an environment of 5% CO2 at 37°C in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
Afatinib (Cayman, San Diego, CA, USA) was dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Clonogenic survival assay
Lung cancer cells in log phase were plated in sixwell plates and pretreated with afatinib at indicated
concentrations or DMSO as controls. Ionizing radiation
(IR) was delivered 2 hours later. Irradiated cells were then
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS
for 14 to 20 days until colony counting. Colonies greater
than 50 cells were counted as surviving colonies and the
number of colonies was normalized to that observed in
unirradiated controls. Mean inactivation doses were
determined by the method of Fertil and colleagues [47],
and the sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) for afatinib
treatment was calculated as the ratio of mean inactivation
dosecontrol/mean inactivation doseafatinib -treated.
For siRNA treatment, cells were transiently
transfected with siRNA-control and siRNA-DNA-pKcs
(Santa Cruz Biotech, CA). Forty-eight hours later, cells
were pretreated with afatinib for 2 hours, and then be reseeded and irradiated for clonogenic survival analysis.

Establishment of the gefitinib-resistant PC-9-GR
subline cells from PC-9 cells
Human NSCLC cell line PC-9 was derived
from an untreated Japanese patient with pulmonary
adenocarcinoma that carried an in-frame deletion in EGFR
exon 19 (delE746-A750) [46]. To establish gefitinibresistant subline cells, PC-9 cells were first treated with 8
nM of gefitinib (Cayman, San Diego, CA, USA), and then
were treated with increased concentrations of gefitinib in
a stepwise manner during each passage and maintenance.
The cells virtually survived in medium containing 8 μM
of gefitinib (sixteen passages) were then seeded on 96well plates for sub-cloning. After 21-28 days, clones
from single cell were harvested and maintained in
gefitinib-free medium. MTS assay were then performed
to test gefitinib resistance. Direct sequencing was also
applied for detection of EGFR T790M mutation in eleven
selected clones. The subcloned cells were then maintained
in gefitinib-free medium for at least one year, and their
sensitivities to gefitinib and presence of T790M mutation
were examined every 10 passages. Of them, a sub-clone
with T790M mutation and stable resistance to gefitinib
was further selected and termed as PC-9-GR for following
experiments.

Immunoﬂuorescence analysis
Cells were cultured on coverslips overnight and
were then exposed to 6 Gy IR alone or IR combined with
pretreatment of afatinib as described above. Cell samples
were collected at indicated time intervals after IR, washed
three times with ice-cold Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), and fixed in 4% formaldehyde/
PBS for 30 min. After permeabilization in 0.5% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes and blocking with 0.05%
Tween + 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature,
cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-phosphoHistone γ-H2AX (1:250, 9719s, signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature, and then
washed with PBS and mounted in Vectashield mounting
medium containing diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector
Laboratories, CA). Images were acquired with LSM 510
confocal microscope (Zeiss, Germen) with 40×objective.
For quantitative analysis, nuclei were analyzed by eye.
At lease 150 cells from each experiment were selected
at random and were counted to calculate the percentage
of cells as “positive” for γ-H2AX if they displayed >5
discrete dots in nuclei. The results from at least 3 different

Mutation analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from the PC-9-GR
cells using DNeasy Blood& Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Venlo,
Netherland) per manufacturer’s instruction. EGFR hotspot
mutations were examined by ADx EGFR Mutations
Detection Kit (Amoy Diagnostics, Xiamen, China). This
kit uses the principle of Amplified Refractory Mutation
System and covers the 29 EGFR mutation hotspots from
exon 18 to 21. The assay was carried out according to
the manufacturer’s protocol with the ABI7900 (Applied
Biosystems, USA) real-time PCR system. Direct DNA
sequence analysis for Exon 18-21 of EGFR was also
applied for detection of potential mutations in tyrosine
kinase domain of EGFR gene.

experiments were averaged.

Western blot analysis

PC-9-GR cells (1×106 in 0.2 mL HBSS 1× + 1%
HSA) were inoculated subcutaneously into the right
thigh of female Nu/Nu mice 4 to 6 weeks old (Charles
River, Beijing, China). When the average tumor volume
reached 200mm3, the mice were randomized into 4 groups
to receive the following treatments: (a) methycellulose/
Tween 80 as vehicle; (b) afatinib (20mg/kg/day) on day114; (c) ionizing radiation 10 Gy on day 5; and (d) afatinib
+ ionizing radiation 10 Gy. Tumors were measured
twice weekly, and tumor volumes were determined from
caliper measurements of tumor length (L) and width
(W) according to the formula (L  ×  W2)/2. Equation of
[%TGI=(1- change of tumor volume in treatment group/
change of tumor volume in control group)×100] was used
to determine the percentage of tumor growth inhibition
and antitumor efficacy.

Cells were collected and washed with cold PBS
twice. Cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Scientiﬁc)
with mild sonication. 20μg of cell lysates were used for
western blot analyses with antibodies against phosphoEGFR, EGFR, phospho-AKT, AKT, phospho-ERK,
ERK, DNA-pKcs and GAPDH. All antibodies were
purchase from cell signaling technology (CST, Danvers,
MA, USA). To verify the changes of protein levels and
protein modification, densitometry for western blot signal
was conducted using Image Lab 5.0 software (BioRad
Laboratories), and intensity for the targeted protein/
modification was normalized to corresponding GAPDH.

Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array assay

Immunohistochemistry analysis

Human Phospho-RTK Array Kit (R&D Systems,
ARY001B) was used to determine changes of
phosphorylation level for forty-nine human receptor
tyrosine kinases in PC-9, PC-9-GR and H1975 cells.
Briefly, cell lysates were diluted and incubated with
array. After binding with the extracellular domain of
RTKs, unbound materials was washed away. A pan antiphospho-tyrosine antibody conjugated to HRP was used to
detect phosphorylated tyrosines on activated receptors by
chemiluminescence.

PC-9-GR xenograft tumors were collected after
14 days of daily treatments as described above and
fixed in 4% formalin. Antigen retrieval was conducted
on FFPE tissues sections for 5 minutes with retrieval
buffer (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) followed by washing
in running water for 5 minutes. Tissue samples were
then rinsed in TBS containing 1% Tween (TBST) and
incubated with endogenous peroxidase blocker on a
LabVision autostainer for 10 minutes. Slides were washed
twice in TBST and incubated with primary antibodies
(pEGFR, Abcam; CC3, DNA-pKcs, γ-H2AX , Cell
Signaling Technology) for 60 minutes at room temperature
and then washed twice in TBST. DAKO EnVision™+
System-HRP was used as second antibody for vitalization
and staining was detected using diaminobenzidine
(DAKO). For Ki67 immunohistochemical analysis,
tumor sections were incubated with biotinylated primary
antibody (DAKO) for 1 minute at room temperature and
then washed twice with TBST. Following 15 minutes
streptavidin-peroxidase treatment and washing with TBST,
slides were counterstained with DAPI and visualized by
chemiluminescence as described above. For analyses
of baseline expression or modulation, IHC scoring of
phospho-EGFR, γ-H2AX, and DNA-pKcs was conducted
with using the following formula: scoring= 0×[% cells
with no staining (0)]+1×[% cells staining faint to barely
visible (1+)] +2×[% cells staining weak to moderately
(2+)] +3×[% cells staining strongly (3+)]. This method
combines positive intensity and percentage tumor cell
staining and is determined by 2 separate pathologists using
microscopy. Quantification of Ki67- and CC3-positive
signals was conducted using the Ariol system (Genetix,
San Jose, CA, USA).

Assessment of apoptosis
Cells were pretreated with afatinib, or DMSO as
control, for 2 hours followed with 6Gy IR. Cells were
then collected 36 hours post-IR and stained with Annexin
V-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) as per manufacturer’s
instructions (Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection
Kit; BD Biosciences, USA). Briefly, 1×106 cells were
washed twice with cold PBS and stained with of Annexin
V-FITC and PI in 1×binding buffer for 10 min at room
temperature in the dark. The populations of apoptotic
cells were determined using a Becton Dickinson FACScan
cytofluorometer. Both early apoptotic (Annexin V-positive
and PI-negative) and late apoptotic (Annexin V-positive
and PI-positive) cells were included as total apoptosis.
For experiment with pan-caspase inhibitor, cells
were pre-treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk (20µM) for two hours, and then treated with afatinib,
IR or the combination. Apoptotic populations of PC-9-GR
were then determined by flow cytometry assay.
