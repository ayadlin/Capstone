For this review, the authors appraised the evidence for adjuvant trastuzumab therapy in early breast cancer. There was level 1 evidence to support the routine use of 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab in conjunction
with chemotherapy for women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive early
breast cancer. The relative benefits of concurrent versus sequential administration remained unclear; however concurrent administration permitted the earliest possible intervention with trastuzumab with possible
superiority. There was evidence to support the use of trastuzumab in both lymph node-positive and highrisk lymph node-negative patients, and preliminary data suggested that all patient subgroups that were eligible for the trials benefit equally from trastuzumab. Adjuvant trastuzumab was associated with a risk of
cardiotoxicity, the long-term impact of which remains largely unknown. Routine cardiac risk assessment
considering left ventricular ejection fraction, age, and prior history of cardiac events is recommended along
with the selection of trastuzumab-based regimens that minimize cardiotoxicity. Trastuzumab acquisition
costs for 1 year of therapy were the largest component of treatment costs. Cancer 2009;115:1154–68.

Increased knowledge of the biologic diversity of breast cancer has been accompanied by increased
efforts to individualize breast cancer treatment based on the underlying molecular features of each tumor.
Approximately 15% to 20% of early breast cancers have amplification of the human epidermal receptor-2
(HER-2) gene, with resultant overexpression of the HER-2 protein.1-3 HER-2 belongs to a family of 4
transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate the growth, differentiation, and survival of cells.4-6
Tumors that over express this protein are imbued with more aggressive qualities, including enhanced
growth and proliferation, increased invasive and metastatic capability, and stimulation of angiogenesis.4,6
Individual trials, population-based studies, and retrospective analyses also have shown that HER-2 overexpression is associated with poorly differentiated, high-grade tumors and lymph node involvement.4,6 Until

Adjuvant Trastuzumab for Breast Cancer/Mackey et al

recently, patients who had breast cancer with HER-2
overexpression (HER-2-positive breast cancer) faced a
markedly poorer prognosis than patients who had breast
cancer without HER-2 overexpression (HER-2 negative
breast cancer).4,6 A promising recent addition to the adjuvant treatment arsenal is trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif), a new agent biologically
targeted against the HER-2 protein that has demonstrated
the ability to mitigate the prognostic disadvantage of
HER-2 expression.
Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody
that targets the extracellular domain of the HER-2 protein. Trastuzumab activates antibody-dependent, cellmediated cytotoxicity and disrupts the signal transduction
process through interference with receptor dimerization,
downstream effectors, and receptor internalization and
degradation.5 Trastuzumab was tested formally in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of
metastatic breast cancer and demonstrated both improved
response rate and improved survival compared with
chemotherapy alone in patients with HER-2-positive
breast cancer.7 Although the risk of cardiotoxicity
increased with the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy, otherwise, trastuzumab was well tolerated. These
results triggered several prospective clinical trials to test
the efficacy of adjuvant trastuzumab in early breast cancer.
In the current review, we have appraised the evidence for
adjuvant trastuzumab therapy in early breast cancer,
considered treatment costs, and reviewed select qualityof-life factors as a means of navigating the landscape of
available and emerging treatment options.

Search Strategy and Study Overview
Published clinical trials of for early breast cancer were
identified in a search of the PubMed database through to
April 2007 using the terms ‘adjuvant or postoperative,’
‘trastuzumab,’ and ‘breast cancer.’ In addition, conference
proceedings from the American Society of Clinical
Oncology (ASCO) (2003-2007), the San Antonio Breast
Cancer Symposium (2003-2007), and the European
Society of Clinical Oncology (2004-2006) were searched
manually for studies that met the eligibility criteria.
Results presented at symposia were considered an important source of current clinical information, and, whenever

available, data from presentations were used to supplement published abstract information. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported efficacy results from
prospective, randomized controlled trials; if they were
published in the English language, and if they investigated
the use of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy in patients with
early breast cancer. Six prospective clinical trials met the
eligibility criteria of this review.

Study Findings
Efficacy

The largest of the adjuvant trastuzumab trials is the
Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial,8,9 which an international randomized study investigating the use of trastuzumab in HER-2-positive patients who have completed
locoregional therapy and a minimum of 4 courses of
chemotherapy. In total, 5102 women with HER-2-positive breast cancer were assigned randomly within 6 weeks
of completing primary therapy to 1 of 3 groups: 1)
women who underwent observation alone; 2) women
who were treated with adjuvant trastuzumab (8 mg/kg
load followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) for 1 year; and 3)
women who were treated with adjuvant trastuzumab at
the same dose and schedule for 2 years. The baseline characteristics of the patients in the HERA trial are summarized in Table 1. It is noteworthy that just over half (57%)
of the women in this trial had lymph node-positive
disease, less than one-third (26%) had received prior
adjuvant anthracycline and taxane therapy, and an
additional 11% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
At a median follow-up of 23.5 months, 1 year of
trastuzumab therapy resulted in significant reductions in
the risk of recurrence (hazards ratio [HR], 0.64; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.540.76 [P < .0001]) and,
despite a 51% crossover rate, the risk of death was significantly reduced (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.470.91 [P ¼
.0115]) (Table 2) compared with observation.9 When
considering the clinical application of sequentially administering trastuzumab after chemotherapy as in the HERA
trial (chemo-trastuzumab sequences), it is important to
consider the following: 1) a potential further benefit may
exist from the concurrent administration of chemotherapy
and trastuzumab10-14 that was not explored in the trial; 2)
significant losses in patient follow-up (5.7% experimental
arm and 3.4% observation arm) and a high rate of patient

crossover (51%) may affect outcomes, particularly overall
survival; and 3) the prior chemotherapy in this trial may
be considered suboptimal. In addition, women were
randomized after they completed chemotherapy, which
may have resulted in a more favorable cohort, because
those with early recurrences were omitted and were not eligible for enrollment.
The 5 subsequent adjuvant trastuzumab trials investigated the administration of trastuzumab in conjunction
with prescribed chemotherapy, whereby trastuzumab was
administered either as a chemo-trastuzumab sequence or
concurrently with the taxane component of the prescribed
regimen (concurrent trastuzumab-taxane regimens) in
women with HER-2-positive tumors. The North Central
Cancer Treatment Group trial (N9831)10,13,15 and the
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial
(B-31)10 are multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled
trials that were designed to explore the benefits of adding
trastuzumab to an adjuvant combination of doxorubicin
and cyclophosphamide (AC) followed by paclitaxel.
In the N9831 trial,10 women with lymph node-positive and high-risk lymph node-negative breast cancer were
assigned randomly to 1 of 3 arms: 1) women who received
AC then weekly paclitaxel (AC!P), 2) women who
received the same AC!P with weekly trastuzumab (4
mg/kg load followed by 2 mg/kg per week) administered
concurrently beginning with the first dose of paclitaxel
and continuing for 1 year (AC!P/Tr), 3) and women
who received the same AC!P followed sequentially, after
the completion of paclitaxel, by 1 year of weekly trastuzumab therapy at the same dose and schedule as the other 2
arms (AC!P!Tr).
In the B-31 trial,10 only lymph node-positive
patients were eligible. Enrolled women were assigned to 1
of 2 arms: 1) AC followed by paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks (AC!P), and 2) the same AC!P with
weekly trastuzumab administered concurrently beginning
with the first cycle of paclitaxel and continuing for 1 year
(AC!P/Tr). Because the N9831 and B-31 trials had
somewhat similar control and treatment arms, a joint
analysis (N9831/B-31 Analysis) comparing the concurrent trastuzumab-taxane arms (AC!P/Tr) with the control arms (AC!P) of the 2 trials was conducted. The
primary endpoint of the N9831/B-31 Analysis was disease-free survival (DFS). A subset of 3968 women qualified for inclusion in the joint analysis, of whom 93% had
1158

lymph node-positive disease (Table 1) and approximately
57% had received weekly paclitaxel.13
At a median follow-up of 2.9 years, despite a 21%
crossover rate,13 AC!P/Tr produced significant reductions in the risk of both recurrence (HR, 0.48; 95% CI,
0.410.57 [P < .00001]) and death (HR, 0.65; 95% CI,
0.510.84 [P ¼ .0007]) compared with AC!P (Table
2).13 These data confirm the findings of the HERA trial.
When considering these findings, it is important to
remember the following: 1) the joint analysis of 2 distinct
trials with different treatment and statistical approaches is
unorthodox; 2) the standards for validation and source
verification used in these trials were less rigorous than
those used in the HERA trial and the Breast Cancer International Research Group 006 (BCIRG 006) trial; 3) a
small percentage of patients who were treated on the study
were identified as HER-2 negative at central review13,16;
and 4) AC!P may be considered suboptimal adjuvant
therapy.3,17
The BCIRG 006 trial is an international, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled study12,18 that was
designed to assess the benefits of adding trastuzumab to an
anthracycline/docetaxel-based or a nonanthracycline, docetaxel, and carboplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in patients with HER-2-positive breast cancer. In
total, 3222 women were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 treatment arms: 1) women who received a combination of AC
followed by docetaxel administered every 3 weeks
(AC!D); 2) women who received AC!D with concurrent, weekly trastuzumab beginning with docetaxel (4 mg/
kg load followed by 2 mg/kg weekly) for the duration of
chemotherapy followed by trastuzumab administered every
3 weeks for a total therapy duration of 1 year (AC!D/Tr);
and 3) women who received a combination of carboplatin,
docetaxel, and weekly trastuzumab followed by trastuzumab administered every 3 weeks for a total therapy duration of 1 year (CB/D/Tr). Patient characteristics were well
balanced across study arms, and approximately 71% of
patients had lymph node-positive disease (Table 1).12
At a median follow-up of 36 months, both the
AC!D/Tr regimen and the CB/D/Tr regimen, compared with AC!D, produced significant reductions in
the risk of both recurrence (HR, 0.61; 95% CI,
0.480.76 [P < .0001]; and HR, 0.67; 95% CI,
0.540.83 [P ¼ .0003], respectively) and death (HR,
0.59; 95% CI, 0.420.85 [P ¼ .004]; and HR, 0.66;

March 15, 2009

Adjuvant Trastuzumab for Breast Cancer/Mackey et al

95% CI, 0.470.93 [P ¼ .017], respectively) (Table 2).12
When considering these study results, it is important to
note that: 1) the results of the BCIRG 006 trial have not
yet been published or peer reviewed, and 2) the nonanthracycline CB/D regimen is not an established adjuvant
regimen for breast cancer.
The Protocole Adjuvant dans le Cancer du Sein
(PACS) 04 study is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial.19 It is the first study designed to
evaluate the benefits of a chemo-trastuzumab sequence
following a prescribed escalated-dose epirubicin or epirubicin-taxane regimen. In total, 3010 women with axillary lymph node-positive breast cancer were assigned
randomly to 1 of 2 arms: 1) a combination of epirubicin
and docetaxel (ED), or 2) a combination of escalateddose epirubicin, fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide
(FEC100). Once their HER-2 status was determined,
women with HER-2-positive tumors (n ¼ 528) immediately underwent a second randomization to 1 year of
trastuzumab administered every 3 weeks (8 mg/kg load
followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or observation. As
in the HERA trial, trastuzumab therapy was initiated after the completion of both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Baseline characteristics of the patients with HER2-positive disease were well balanced (Table 1).19
At a median follow-up of 4 years, the PACS-04
study has the longest follow-up of trastuzumab trials
reported to date. Results from the first randomization
comparing concomitant ED with FEC100 have yet to be
reported; however results of the second randomization
failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the risk of
recurrence (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.611.22 [P ¼ .41]) or
death (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.682.38 [P value not
reported]) for chemo-trastuzumab sequences compared
with observation (Table 2). When considering these findings, it is important to note that: 1) the study may have
been underpowered because of the small sample size; 2) as
in the HERA trial, the sequential approach may have precluded a potential benefit from the concurrent administration of chemotherapy and trastuzumab10-14; 3) in
contrast to the HERA trial population, a large proportion
of patients in the PACS-04 trial received optimal chemotherapy, which may explain the reduced incremental benefit of trastuzumab observed in the PACS-04 relative to
the HERA trial; and 4) the PACS-04 results have not
been published or peer reviewed.

The Finland Herceptin (FinHer) study is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial11 that was
designed to assess the benefits of docetaxel administered
every 3 weeks (D) or weekly vinorelbine (V) followed by
fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) in
1010 women with axillary lymph node-positive or highrisk, lymph node-negative breast cancer. The study also
assigned 232 women with HER-2-positive tumors to
receive 9 cycles of weekly trastuzumab (4 mg/kg load followed by 2 mg/kg weekly) administered concurrently
with either docetaxel, or vinorelbine, or no further treatment. Baseline characteristics of the patients were balanced with the exception of axillary lymph node
metastases, which were somewhat more frequent in the
trastuzumab group than in the observation group (89% vs
78%, respectively) (Table 1).11
At a median follow-up of 3 years, as in the 4 larger
trastuzumab trials, fewer events of recurrence were evident
for women who received trastuzumab (HR, 0.42; 95%
CI, 0.210.83 [P ¼ .01]) compared with women who
did not (Table 2), although overall survival reached only
borderline significance, most likely because of the small
sample size (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.161.08 [P ¼ .07])
(Table 2).11 Although the short 9-week course of trastuzumab therapy (short-course trastuzumab therapy) proved
beneficial, caution should be used when interpreting these
findings, because: 1) the sample size of the HER-2-positive patient population was small; 2) the study prescribed
lower than standard doses of both anthracyclines and taxanes; and 3) although there was a trend toward improved
overall survival with the addition of trastuzumab, the
findings were not statistically significant.
Safety
Noncardiac adverse events

Trastuzumab is associated with few grade 3 or 4
adverse effects. Small but significant increases in severe
adverse events were reported with trastuzumab compared
with observation (11% vs 6%; P < .0001) in the HERA
trial.9 However, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy did not result in clinically significant increases
in the incidence of adverse events compared with controls
in the FinHer trial,11 the N9831/B-31 Analysis,10 or the
AC!D/Tr arm of the BCIRG 006 trial.12 The CB/D/Tr
regimen was the only treatment that produced less severe
toxicity compared with controls.12

Review Article
Cardiotoxicity

Because both anthracyclines and trastuzumab are
cardiotoxic,20-22 significant measures were undertaken to
mitigate cardiac risk in all trials. These include appropriate eligibility criteria, cardiac screening and monitoring,
and strict criteria for the initiation and discontinuation
of trastuzumab therapy.8-12,19
Chemo-trastuzumab sequences were explored in 3
of the 6 trials: the HERA trial, the sequential arm of the
N9831 trial, and the PACS-04 trial. The reported cardiac data captured differing components of therapy
across trials. Because patients in the HERA and PACS04 trials were randomized after the completion of chemotherapy, the reported cardiotoxicity data from these
trials reflects trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity exclusively, because patients with compromised cardiac
capacity after chemotherapy were excluded from the
trastuzumab portion of the trial. In the N9831 trial,
although patients were randomized before they received
chemotherapy, the trial reports cumulative post-AC cardiotoxicity, which may not fully capture the anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity of the AC portion of
chemotherapy.
Furthermore, the rigor of cardiac screening in the 3
trials differed considerably: Patients in the HERA trial
had a more favorable cardiac profile (left ventricular
ejection fraction [LVEF] >55% after chemotherapy and
locoregional therapy) relative to patients in both the
PACS-04 trial (LVEF 55% or between 50% and 55%
with cardiologist approval) and the N9831 trial (LVEF
>50%).
Chemo-trastuzumab sequences were associated with
increases in cardiotoxicity in all 3 trials. Patients in the
HERA trial experienced a small but significantly greater
degree of cardiotoxicity with trastuzumab compared with
observation, including a confirmed, significant decrease
in LVEF (3.04% vs 0.53%; P < .0001), symptomatic
congestive heart failure (CHF) (2.15% vs 0.12%; P <
.0001), and severe CHF (0.60% vs 0%; P < .0001); thus,
4.3% of patients were unable to complete trastuzumab
therapy for cardiac reasons.9,23 Patients in the PACS-04
trial also experienced increased cardiotoxicity with the
addition of trastuzumab, resulting in increases in severe
CHF (1.7% vs 0.4%) and a higher rate of discontinuation
due to cardiotoxicity (17.9%) (Table 3).19 Finally, when
sequential trastuzumab was added to the AC!P arm of
1160

the N9831 trial, increases in cardiac events once again
were apparent (2.8% vs 0.3%).24
Concurrent trastuzumab-taxane regimens were
explored in 3 of the 6 trials.10,12,15 In all 3 studies, only
patients who had an LVEF >50% after the completion of
AC therapy were eligible for trastuzumab therapy, resulting in a small proportion of enrolled patients in all 3 trials
being denied trastuzumab therapy (N9831/B31 Analysis,
6.7% of patients; BCIRG 006 trial, 2% of patients). Cardiotoxicity was evident in all 3 trials. The addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel after the completion of AC resulted
in an increase in cumulative cardiac events (either events
from cardiac causes or New York Heart Association
[NYHA] class III or IV CHF) compared with controls in
both the N9831 and B31 trials (3-year cumulative cardiac
events [N9831], 3.3% vs 0.3%; 5-year cumulative cardiac
events [B31], 3.8% vs 0.9%).24,25 Furthermore, 15% of
patients in the N9831 trial and 19% of patients in the
B31 trial were unable to complete trastuzumab therapy
for cardiac reasons.26,27 Increased cardiotoxicity also was
apparent in the AC!D/Tr arm of the BCIRG 006 compared with controls (>10% relative LVEF decline; 18.1%
vs 10.1%, respectively; P < .0001; NYHA grade 3 or 4
CHF, 1.9% vs 0.4%, respectively)12; and, similar to the
other concurrent trastuzumab-taxane trials, 8.3% of
patients who received AC!D/Tr were unable to complete therapy because of trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity (unpublished data).
The nonanthracycline-containing, concurrent trastuzumab-taxane regimen (CB/D/Tr) of the BCIRG 006
trial and the short-course trastuzumab regimen of the
FinHer trial were the least cardiotoxic. At 3 years, no
increase in cardiotoxicity was apparent for CB/D/Tr compared with controls (>10% relative LVEF decline, 8.6%
vs 10.1%; grade 3/4 CHF, 0.4% vs 0.4%) in the BCIRG
006 trial (Table 3),12 and none of the 4 patients who
experienced cardiac infarction or failure in the FinHer
trial had received trastuzumab (Table 3).11

DISCUSSION
There is overwhelming evidence to support the overall
benefits of adding adjuvant trastuzumab to chemotherapy
in women with HER-2-positive cancer despite the risk of
developing clinically significant cardiac toxicity. Although
the benefit of adjuvant trastuzumab is clear, many

questions remain related to the clinical application of
these findings.

Are There Patient Groups That Benefit
More or Less From Trastuzumab Therapy?
In light of the risks and costs associated with trastuzumab
therapy, the accurate identification of patients with HER2-positive tumors who preferentially may benefit from trastuzumab therapy is imperative. Both fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) and chromogenic in situ hybridization, as well as immunohistochemistry testing with or without FISH confirmation, have been used in the adjuvant
setting to assess HER-2 status.9-12 Central confirmation of
HER-2 status before enrolment was required in all studies
with the exception of an initial cohort of the N9831 trial
and all patients in the B-31 trials, which relied on testing in
approved local laboratories. Differences between local and
central HER-2 assessment and between immunohistochemistry and FISH testing have been reported in the
N9831 and B-31 trials, revealing a proportion of patients
in both trials with HER-2-negative tumors at central review
(8.8% and 9.7, respectively).13,28 Unexpectedly, in addition to the benefits of trastuzumab among HER-2-positive
patients, exploratory subgroup analyses from both the
N9831 trial and the B-31 trial revealed a potential benefit
for trastuzumab among patients who tested negative for
HER-2 at central review.13,28 Discordance in HER-2 testing and the possibility of heterogeneity in relative treatment
effect underscore the importance of continued research
into optimal HER-2 testing and the use of standardized
HER-2 testing in clinical practice.
Adjuvant trastuzumab trials enrolled significant proportions of patients with lymph node-positive and highrisk, lymph node-negative disease. Although low numbers
of very small T1a and T1b tumors were included in the
high-risk, lymph node-negative cohorts,9,12 nevertheless,
it is reasonable to consider the use of the aforementioned
trastuzumab regimens in all patients who have lymph
node-negative, HER-2-positive disease with a high-risk of
recurrence.
None of the trials that we reviewed were powered to
detect the effect of trastuzumab in patient subgroups at
the time of their interim analyses. However, an early look
at the forest plots of HRs for DFS in the HERA trial,9 the
BCIRG 006 trial,12 and the N9831/B-31 Analysis10,13
1162

suggest that all eligible patient subgroups, regardless of
age, lymph node status, menopausal status, or hormone
status, benefited equally from trastuzumab.
Both HER-2/neu amplification and topoisomerase IIa
(Topo IIa) amplification are associated with a relative benefit from anthracycline-containing regimens compared
with nonanthracycline-containing regimens.29-34 It has
been postulated that this benefit may relate to the physical
proximity on chromosome 17q of the HER-2 and Topo
IIa gene, because topoisomerase II is involved integrally in
the mechanism of action of the anthracyclines. Data from
the BCIRG 006 trial demonstrated that CB/D/Tr is
equivalent to AC!D/Tr in patients overall; however, in
the 35% of women with HER2-positive early breast cancer in whom the Topo IIa and HER-2 genes are coamplified, CB/D/Tr and AC!D/Tr are equivalent to
AC!D.12 These data suggest that anthracycline-containing chemotherapy may not be required in HER-2-overexpressing women and/or that trastuzumab may not be
required in addition to an anthracycline-containing
regimen in women with HER-2/Topo IIa coamplified
tumors.
A meta-analysis of studies comparing higher dose
anthracycline-containing regimens with standard-dose
anthracycline-containing regimens suggested that women
with HER-2-positive tumors benefited from higher dose
chemotherapy compared with standard-dose chemotherapy, whereas women with HER-2-negative tumors did
not.35 Similarly, a significant interaction between HER-2
status and taxane-containing versus nontaxane-containing
regimens have been reported.36,37 In Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial 9344 trial, both women with HER-2positive tumors and women with HER-2-negative tumors
benefited from the addition of taxanes; however, those
with HER-2-positive tumors did so to a greater degree.
An analysis of the PACS-04 and BCIRG 006 clinical trial
populations designed to assess the benefits of HER-2 and
Topo IIa as predictors of response to trastuzumab currently is underway.

trastuzumab indicate an increased risk of recurrence
within 1 to 2 years, providing a rationale for the earliest
possible intervention with trastuzumab.9,13 Concurrent
trastuzumab-taxane regimens10-12 minimize postsurgery
trastuzuamb treatment delays (14 months), whereas
chemo-trastuzumab sequences administered in the HERA
trial (8 months) and the PACS-04 trial9,19 tend to incur
greater trastuzumab delays. At 3 years, all 4 concurrent
trastuzumab-taxane regimens10,12 resulted in improved
DFS compared with controls, and 2-year results from the
HERA trial demonstrated a similar improvement in DFS
for chemo-trastuzumab sequences compared with observation. However, at 4 years, outcomes for the PACS-04
trial did not indicate a benefit for aggressive anthracycline-based regimens or anthracycline-taxane regimens
compared with controls (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.611.22
[P ¼ .41]) despite a trend toward improved DFS during
the first 18 months (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.301.09
[P value not reached]).19 This suggests a potential attenuation of the benefit of trastuzumab with delayed
administration, which may indicate a cytostatic effect for
sequential trastuzumab administration, whereas concurrent use may result in a cytotoxic effect.
The N9831 trial is the only adjuvant trastuzumab
trial that was designed to directly compare the sequential
versus concurrent approaches.15 Although a sufficient
number of events are currently unavailable to complete
this analysis, initial data suggest that sequential trastuzumab administration may result in inferior efficacy (DFS:
HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.460.91 [P ¼ .0114]) compared
with concurrent administration.15,24 Until the final
results of this analysis are available, the benefits of concurrent versus sequential administration remain unclear.

What Is the Optimal Duration of
Trastuzumab-based Therapy?
The balance of available evidence supports the use of
1-year of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy.8-10,12,13 The
HERA trial, which was designed to evaluate duration of
therapy, assessed the benefits of 2 years of therapy compared with 1 year.9 Results from that trial, anticipated in
the fall of 2008, will provide insight into the risk-benefit
ratio for extended trastuzumab exposure; however, even
longer follow-up will be required to confirm the safety of
this treatment approach.
Cancer

March 15, 2009

The use of short-course trastuzumab therapy has
clinical appeal because of the enhanced safety profile,
reduced cost, and improved quality of life of this
approach compared with 1 year of trastuzumab therapy.
The significant reductions in the risk of recurrence
observed with short-course trastuzumab therapy compared with controls in the FinHer trial11 and the noninferiority of short-course trastuzumab therapy relative
to 1 year of therapy in the randomized phase 2 E2198
pilot trial,38 although not powered to assess therapy
duration, support this approach. Nevertheless, evidence
from larger randomized clinical trials, such as the Synergism or Long Duration (SOLD) study and the Protocol of Herceptin Adjuvant with Reduced Exposure
(PHARE) trial, directly comparing short versus longer
durations of trastuzumab therapy is needed to establish
the noninferiority of this approach. Until mature study
findings from these trials are available, short-course
trastuzumab therapy should be reserved for instances in
which institutional budgetary restraints or patient
preference limit the administration of a full year of
trastuzumab therapy.

What Are the Implications of
Trastuzumab-related Cardiotoxicity?
Unlike anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity, some
degree of cardiac recovery appears to be possible with trastuzumab-mediated cardiotoxicity. In the HERA trial,
heart failure treatment was recommended for all patients
with severe CHF. At a median follow-up of 1 year, of the
10 patients who had severe CHF at the last scheduled
assessment, 8 patients (80%) were asymptomatic, and 6
patients (60%) had an LVEF 55%.23 In the N9831
trial, at a median follow-up of 2 years, the majority of
patients who developed CHF improved on medical treatment, and LVEFs >50% were observed in approximately
50% of patients who received sequential therapy and in
61% of patients who received concurrent therapy at 2
years.26 Finally, in the B-31 trial, with 5 years follow-up,
women who had confirmed CHF and at least 6 months of
follow-up usually were asymptomatic (85%). Although a
large proportion required medication (61%), approximately 66% of patients had an LVEF >50% on a followup multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan.25

Review Article

Which Patients Are at a Greater Risk
of Cardiotoxicity?
The ability to reliably predict a patient’s risk of developing
CHF is of great clinical importance. The HERA, N9831,
and B-31 trials conducted analyses to identify factors that
were correlated with an increased risk of cardiotoxicity
with adjuvant trastuzumab therapy. Lower screening
LVEFs,23-25 lower post-AC LVEFs,25 and age24,25 were
associated with significant increases in cardiotoxicity.
Other factors that were associated with increased cardiotoxicity included higher doses of anthracyclines,23
increased body mass index,23 and the requirement for
hypertensive medications.24,25 Although the analyses of
potential risk factors are exploratory and were based on
small numbers, routine cardiac risk assessment is recommended for all trastuzumab candidates, especially those at
an increased risk for cardiotoxicity.
Should Trastuzumab-based Therapy Be
Given Concurrently With Radiotherapy?
Preclinical data indicate that trastuzumab may exert a
radiosensitizing effect on HER-2-positive breast cancer
cells, although it is uncertain whether it has a similar effect
on normal cells.39,40 In the adjuvant studies that we
reviewed, trastuzumab was administered either concurrently with radiotherapy after the completion of chemotherapy10 or after the completion of both chemotherapy
and radiotherapy.9,19 When trastuzumab was administered concurrently, left-sided tumors and radiation
therapy were not identified as cardiac risk factors,25 radiotherapy was not observed to increase cardiac events or
radiation-related adverse events, and internal mammary
radiotherapy appeared to be feasible when the cardiac
dose was limited.39 These study findings support the continued practice of concurrent trastuzumab and radiotherapy administration after the completion of chemotherapy
in conjunction with continued cardiac follow-up.
Should Trastuzumab-based Therapy Be
Given Concurrently With Endocrine
Therapy?
There is a strong rationale for the concurrent, early
administration of endocrine therapy and trastuzumab in
HER-2-positive and hormone receptor-positive breast
1164

cancer because of preclinical evidence of cross talk
between HER-2 and estrogen receptor signaling pathways. Recent evidence from the first-line metastatic
breast cancer setting provides further support for this
approach.41 Women who received concurrent endocrine
therapy had a benefit from trastuzumab similar to the
benefit experienced by those who did not receive
endocrine therapy with no increase in toxicity.8,10-12,19
These findings support the continued practice of concurrent endocrine and trastuzumab administration after the
completion of chemotherapy in HER-2-positive and hormone receptor-positive patients.

How Do Trastuzumab-based Regimens
Compare in Terms of Cost?
The administration of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy is
associated with considerable expense. In addition to the
cost of diagnostic testing, significant treatment costs
include acquisition costs, administration costs (nursing
and pharmacy time), and the costs of clinical cardiac monitoring. Numerous cost-effectiveness studies suggest that
costs are comparable to other accepted and standard uses
of healthcare dollars42-46; nevertheless, factoring in treatment costs when selecting from among safe and effective
treatment options improves the overall cost-benefit ratio
of the intervention. Selected treatment costs for chemotrastuzumab sequences and concurrent trastuzumab-taxane regimens are summarized in Table 4.
Trastuzumab acquisition costs for 1 year of therapy
were the single greatest factor contributing to total treatment costs (in U.S. dollars, between $41,459 and $43,023),
followed by cardiac monitoring by MUGA scan (between
$3675 and $4410). The administration costs associated
with 1 year of trastuzumab therapy administered every 3
weeks were significantly less than those associated with
weekly administration ($510 vs $1473). The inclusion of
taxanes increased total treatment costs. The short-course
trastuzumab regimen from the FinHer trial ($16,747) was
associated with the lowest total treatment cost.

Which Trastuzumab-based Regimen Is Most
Convenient for Patients?

significant impact on a patient’s quality of life, especially

patients receiving either chemo-trastuzumab sequences or
concurrent trastuzumab-taxane regimens are summarized
in Table 5. Of the regimens that administered 1 year of
therapy, the concurrent trastuzumab-taxane regimens
resulted in shorter total treatment durations compared
with the chemo-trastuzumab sequences. The administration of both trastuzumab and paclitaxel every 3 weeks
resulted in significantly fewer patient visits compared with
weekly administration. Total clinic time was shortest for
nontaxane trastuzumab regimens and longest for regimens
that involved paclitaxel. The short-course trastuzumab

provide insight into the benefits of combining targeted
therapies.
In conclusion, the current review indicates that there
is level 1 evidence to support the routine use of 1 year of
adjuvant trastuzumab in conjunction with chemotherapy
in women who have early-stage, HER-2-positive breast
cancer. Because adjuvant trastuzumab is associated with a
risk of cardiotoxicity in the form of severe CHF, compromised LVEF function, and potential for cardiovascular
disease, every effort should be made to preserve cardiac
function through routine cardiac risk assessment and the
selection of minimally cardiotoxic regimens.
