ABSTRACT
Target-specific agents used in melanoma are not curative, and chemokines
are being implicated in drug-resistance to target-specific agents. Thus, the use of
conventional agents in rationale combinations may result in optimization of therapy.
Because histone deacetylases participate in tumor development and progression, the
combination of the pan-inhibitor SAHA and temozolomide might provide a therapeutic
advantage. Here, we show synergism between the two drugs in mutant BRAF cell
lines, in association with decreased phosphorylation of cell survival proteins (e.g.,
C-Jun-N-terminal-kinase, JNK). In the spontaneous ret transgenic mouse melanoma
model, combination therapy produced a significant disease onset delay and downregulation of Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), JNK, and of Myeloid-derived
suppressor cell recruitment. Co-incubation with a CCL2-blocking-antibody enhanced
in vitro cell sensitivity to temozolomide. Conversely, recombinant CCL2 activated JNK
in human tumor melanoma cells. In keeping with these results, the combination of a
JNK-inhibitor with temozolomide was synergistic. By showing that down-regulation
of CCL2-driven signals by SAHA and temozolomide via JNK contributes to reduce
melanoma growth, we provide a rationale for the therapeutic advantage of the drug
combination. This combination strategy may be effective because of interference both
with tumor cell and tumor microenvironment.

and responsiveness to immune intervention (e.g., anti
CTLA4/PD1 antibodies, Ipilumab/Yervoy), metastatic
melanoma is still incurable [1-3]. Resistance to therapy
is due to multiple factors which include both tumor cell
alterations during tumor development and progression,
and extrinsic factors present in the microenvironment,

ligand 2 (CCL2)/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 [4, 5].
Deregulation of the balance between melanocyte stem
cell proliferation and differentiation into melanocytes, a
process implicating multiple genes and epigenetic factors,
is thought to result in melanoma initiation and progression
[6].
In melanoma, deregulation of survival pathways
as a consequence of BRAF mutation is a frequent event
[7]. Because BRAF signals through the MAPK pathway,
such a pathway is recognized as relevant in melanoma cell
survival. Besides being activated by BRAF mutation, the
MAPK pathway hyper-activation can be achieved by deregulated expression of tyrosine kinases including those
of the HER family and RET [8, 9]. Moreover, besides
MAPK activation, gene-specific mutation signals triggered
by mutant BRAF on other pathways have been reported
to lead to transcriptional changes [10]. Altered DNA
methylation or acetylation may participate to regulate such
changes [11].
Malignant transformation is also driven by
epigenetic mechanisms that involve histone deacetylases
(HDAC) which remove acetyl groups from histones,
thereby promoting chromatin condensation and acting
as transcription repressors [12]. Conversely, acetylation
of histones promotes a relaxed chromatin structure,
allowing transcriptional activation. Histone modifications
regulate gene-expression patterns underlying a variety of
biological processes including response to stress and to
DNA damage [12]. In addition, HDAC have non-histone
substrates, including regulators of transcription, heat
shock protein-90, and α-tubulin [13]. Since HDAC may be
implicated in the silencing of growth regulatory pathways
relevant to sustain tumor progression and drug resistance
[14], HDAC inhibitors may improve response to antitumor
agents.
The only cytotoxic agent approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of melanoma
is the triazine dacarbazine [15]. Temozolomide (TMZ)
[16], an imidazotetrazine derivative of dacarbazine
is an attractive agent for patients with unresectable
metastatic malignant melanoma due to its oral route of
administration and its ability to cross the blood brain
barrier [17]; TMZ is currently undergoing clinical
evaluation in melanoma (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).
Novel therapeutic options are needed to improve the
activity of such clinically available agents and to define
alternative treatments for patients recurring after BRAF
inhibitors (i.e., bearing mutant BRAF tumors) as well as
for patients bearing tumors with wild-type BRAF. In this
regard, HDAC inhibitors represent promising therapeutic
agents because they are expected to act on tumor cells
and their microenvironment as they are endowed with
immunomodulatory properties [18]. Indeed, it has been
shown that HDAC inhibitors reduce tumor and immune
cell ability to produce various inflammatory factors [19www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

22]. It is known that persistent production of inflammatory
factors under chronic inflammatory conditions in the
tumor microenvironment strongly supports the generation,
recruitment and activation of myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSC) [23-25]. Many anti-inflammatory effects
of histone deacetylase inhibitors are mediated through
effects on antigen-presenting cells, including monocytes
[26]. Suppression of granulocyte chemotactic protein-2
(GCP-2), monocyte chemotactic protein-2 (MCP-2) and
macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been
reported in rheumatoid arthritic synovial fibroblastic cells
[27]. Although the pan-HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid (SAHA, vorinostat) has been approved
for the treatment of cutaneous T lymphomas [28], its role
in the treatment of melanoma is still under investigation
(e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01587352).
Based on this background, we hypothesize that
SAHA could be useful in an attempt to improve the
efficacy of the TMZ and we used a panel of human
melanoma cell lines, expressing alterations found in
tumors from patients resistant to BRAF inhibitors,
to investigate the therapeutic potential of SAHA in
combination with the clinically available TMZ. Given the
immunomodulatory potential of SAHA, the combination
was tested in vivo on the ret transgenic mouse model of
spontaneous melanoma. Here, we describe the molecular
correlates of the efficacy of the combination of SAHA and
TMZ, and we propose that disruption of CCL2-driven
signals by SAHA and TMZ may impair survival of human
melanoma cells resulting in a synergistic drug interaction
which in mice results in delayed disease onset.

RESULTS
The combination between temozolomide and the
pan-HDAC inhibitor SAHA displays an improved
effect in human melanoma mutant and wild-type
BRAF cells
A panel of human melanoma cell lines well
characterized for their molecular features was used in this
study. They included A375, LM17, LM20, LM36, 501Mel
exhibiting the BRAFV600E mutation, and two BRAF wildtype cell lines, LM18 and LM23. The LM20 and 501Mel
cell lines display intrinsic resistance to the BRAF inhibitor
PLX4032. LM20 cells carry amplifications of CDNN1 and
CTNNB1, and 501Mel cells display high MET expression
[29] (data not shown). Cell sensitivity to TMZ and to the
pan-HDAC inhibitor SAHA was variable among the cell
lines (Table 1). The effect of their combination was tested
by the Chou and Talalay method in which a CI lower
than 1 indicates synergism. Under such experimental
conditions, a favourable drug interaction was observed in
the different cell lines irrespectively of the relative level
4517

of sensitivity to TMZ or to SAHA (Figure 1). Indeed, a
synergistic drug interaction was particularly evident in the
five studied mutant BRAF cells – including established
cell lines and cell lines recently derived from patients - as
supported by the CI values (Supplementary Figure S1)

cell lines upon the combined treatment (Figure 2A, right
panel, Figure 2B, and data not shown). These data suggest
a preferential impact of the combined treatment on JNK
activation status.
The combination treatment resulted in an increase
in apoptosis in A375 cells (Figure 2C) and in other cells
lines (Supplementary Figure S2). Although in some
models there was no evidence of increased apoptosis 72
h after drug exposure, apoptosis was observed 144 h after
treatment (e.g., in LM36 cells), indicating that cell death
could be a late event.

Analysis of proteins involved in survival-pathways
reveals consistent down-regulation of JNK
activation upon combined treatment
We hypothesized that the effect of the drug
combination might be due to inhibition of the MAPK
pathway resulting in growth inhibition (see Figure 1) and/
or apoptosis. Thus, the A375 cell line was used to profile
response to treatment with particular reference to the
MAPK pathway (Figure 2A). We hybridized lysates of
A375 cells treated with SAHA, TMZ or their combination
with antibody arrays (Figure 2A, left panel). Exposure to
SAHA produced a decrease in phospho-AKT levels, an
effect that was more pronounced for the AKT2 isoform for
which the down-regulation was still evident in cells treated
with TMZ and with the drug combination. Exposure to the
combination decreased the levels of phospho-JNK2 and
phospho-p38γ. Western blot validation analysis evidenced
a decrease of phospho-AKT2 (Figure 2A, right panel). The
most frequent and consistent modulation was the downregulation of phospho-JNK1/2 found in BRAF mutant

Combination therapy produces a disease onset
delay in the spontaneous ret transgenic mouse
melanoma model associated with down-regulation
of JNK activation in tumors
Ret transgenic mice which spontaneously
develop melanoma were used. Because plasma LDH is
considered a melanoma prognosis biomarker in humans,
to characterize the model and to investigate the potential
association between plasma LDH and disease in mice
undergoing melanoma development, we measured LDH
values in cases and control mice over time. Logistic
regression analysis showed a borderline association
between disease status and LDH values (data not shown).

Supplementary Table S1 reports some descriptive statistics
of the variable LDH in cases and controls. The box-plots
(Supplementary Figure S3) describing the distribution
of LDH in transgenic mice bearing melanoma (cases)
and healthy mice (controls) show the increased LDH
value observed in cases. Thus, this model showed some
similarities with the human disease and was considered
more useful than xenograft models because of the presence
of a competent immune system.
When investigating the antitumor activity of the
combination of SAHA and TMZ, mice bearing the ret
transgene received SAHA, TMZ or both drugs (Figure
3A). Drug combination led to a significant delay in
disease onset (P value of log-rank test: 0.0176). Mouse
Phospho-RTK array analyses in tumors indicated a downmodulation of selected phospho-proteins after treatment
(Figure 3B). Validation experiments confirmed downregulation of phospho-PDGF receptor and phosphoRET levels (Figure 3C). Reduced phopho-JNK1/2 levels
were observed upon combination treatment (Figure 3D),

similarly to what observed in cell lines.

Combination therapy produces down-regulation
of the tumor chemokine CCL2 and of MDSC
recruitment
To gain insights into the chronic inflammatory
tumor microenvironment that could modulate tumor
growth, we measured the levels of inflammatory factors
in tumor lesions. The treatment with SAHA, TMZ or the
combination was capable of modulating the pattern of
tumor-associated chronic inflammatory mediators. Using
the Kruskal-Wallis Test (KWT), we found a statistically
significant association between the experimental groups
and each of the considered continuous variable. A
significant down-modulation was observed after exposure
to the drug combination as compared to control animals for
chemokines (CCL2, KWT Bonferroni adjusted P-values
were: 0.04 for CCL2; 0.02 for CCL4; 0.02 for CCL5)

(Figure 4A). Similarly, a significant decrease (KWT
Bonferroni adjusted p-value: 0.02) was also found for IL1α (Figure 4Β), which was shown to be a key mediator
of sterile inflammation and being able to recruit MDSC
towards the site of inflammation [23]. The concentration
of another pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, showed a
borderline significant down-modulation after combination
treatment as compared to control group (KWT Bonferroni
adjusted P-value: 0.08, Figure 4B). We found a significant
reduction in the production of some immunosuppressive
growth factors (KWT Bonferroni adjusted P-values were:
0.01 for TGF-β1; 0.01 for VEGF) in the drug combination
treated groups as compared to controls (Figure 4C).
Because HDAC inhibitors are expected to act on
transcription regulation, the modulation at the protein level
in part reflected that of mRNA in tumors, as shown by
TaqMan arrays; down-modulation of CCL2 was confirmed
also in human melanoma cells (Supplementary Figure S4).
All above mentioned factors mediate tumor-induced
immune-suppression directly and via the generation,
recruitment and activation of CD11b+Gr1+ MDSC [23].
Thus, the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells in the
tumor microenvironment would also be diminished
by treatment. Indeed, the population of CD11b+Gr1+
immature myeloid cells measured by flow cytometry
tended to be reduced in the tumors upon all applied
treatments as compared to the controls (Figure 4D)
although no statistical significant results were found.
Furthermore, the infiltration of these tumor samples with

leukocytes (defined as CD45.2+ cells) remained similar
in all considered groups (Figure 4E). A trend towards an
increase of regulatory T cells was observed in tumors from
single drug- and combination-treated mice (Figure 4F).

The chemokine CCL2 can influence response to
treatment via JNK
To better investigate the role of pro-survival signals
in melanoma, we established a cell line (Me1482) from
a tumor developed by mice (Supplementary Figure
S5). When the effect of the combination of TMZ and
SAHA was examined, a supra-additive effect was found
according to the Chou and Talalay method (Figure 5A).
Given the relevance of CCL2 in maintaining cell survival
[24], we focused our attention on this chemokine. Control
and drug-treated cells released CCL2 in the medium,
suggesting that chemokines released by the tumor in the
microenvironment can influence response to treatment
(Figure 5B). Consistently, we observed a release of
CCL2 in the medium of the human cells (141.9 ± 28.6
pg CCL2/ µg proteins for A375 cells, 211.5 ± 17.9 pg
CCL2/µg proteins for LM23 cells and 2.8 ± 1.4 pg CCL2/
µg proteins for LM17 cells). In murine cells, a trend
toward decrease of CCL2 levels in the supernatant was
found, and this tendency was evident also in supernatants
from human LM17 cells treated for 24 h, in which the
drug combination produced a 68% decrease of CCL2

levels, whereas decrease after single agent treatments
were around 40% (42% upon 0.1 µM SAHA exposure,
43% upon 30 µM TMZ exposure). In LM17 cells, preincubation with an anti-CCL2 antibody followed by
TMZ exposure enhanced sensitivity to TMZ (Figure
6A). We hypothesized that CCL2 activated JNK, whose
phosphorylation was decreased by the combination in
vivo and in vitro. We observed that recombinant-CCL2
triggered JNK-activation in LM17 cells (Figure 6B). We
tested whether a synergistic interaction could occur when
combining TMZ and the JNK-inhibitor SP600125 and a
marked synergistic interaction was observed as supported
by CI values (Figure 6C-D).

activity of clinically available agents, in the present
study we used various molecularly characterized human
melanoma cells, including cell lines with intrinsic
resistance to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, and
ret transgenic mice to suppress tumor cell survival
signals employing the pan-HDAC-inhibitor SAHA in
combination with TMZ. The ret transgenic mouse model
was chosen because it recapitulates the complexity of
melanoma disease. In the used panel of melanoma cell
lines, irrespectively of the inherent cell sensitivity to
single agents, we found an improved effect of the drug
combination as compared to single drugs, in association
with the suppression of pro-survival signals. A feature
of tumor cells exposed to the combination was the
modulation of the phosphorylation profile of proteins
involved in regulation of cell survival including AKT and
members of the MAPK pathway. Of note, phosphorylation
of JNK was reduced upon exposure to the combination in
the cell lines in which the synergistic interaction occurred.
Such an effect was associated with increased apoptosis
in some cell lines. The synergistic interaction was more
evident in cells characterized by BRAF mutation than
in cell carrying wild-type BRAF, although the drug
interaction on the latter cells was still favourable.
In addition, an improved response to the
combination of SAHA and TMZ was evident in ret mice,
which benefitted from combined treatment in terms
of disease free-survival. The combination treatment
led to a down-regulation of JNK activation in tumors,
similarly to in vitro findings. When investigating the
effect of the combination on the tumor inflammatory
microenvironment, we found that levels of chemokines
including CCL2 were significantly down-regulated
in the primary tumors after the combined treatment
compared to controls. Our data are reminiscent of what
observed in a recent report in which down-regulation of
CCL2 after treatment with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720
was associated with reduced tumor growth [4]. Thus,
the combination, while being therapeutically effective
by improving disease free-survival could provide an
approach to impair CCL2 production, an effect that may
be exploited in the clinical setting to control melanoma
growth.
The available evidence supports that CCL2, a
chemotactic factor for monocytes and T lymphocytes
plays key roles in tumorigenesis promotion in different
tumor types [30, 31]. Intracellular JNK-signaling is
implicated in CCL2 expression and CCL2-mediated
proliferation [31, 32]. Consistently, cells lacking JNK1/2
were shown to display reduced levels of ccl2 mRNA [33].
Because a decrease in the levels of CCL2 was observed in
our in vivo model, we further investigated the relationship
between CCL2 and JNK. In cultured murine melanoma
cells, we found that CCL2 was released in the medium
suggesting that it is produced by cells and it might act
in sustaining survival by autocrine/paracrine mechanisms

DISCUSSION
Based on the need for rationally improving the

in the tumor microenvironment. When we treated human
melanoma cells with recombinant-CCL2, we observed
that the chemokine could trigger JNK activation as
phosphorylation of JNK1/2 was found. Under such
conditions, we did not observe modulation of IKBα,
known to be down-regulated following NF-kB activation,
and of AKT, whose phosphorylation remained unchanged
after recombinant-CCL2 treatment. Thus, a specific
CCL2-driven JNK1/2 activation occurred in our model.
Moreover, JNK appeared to sustain growth of melanoma
cells exposed to TMZ, because upon pharmacological
JNK-inhibition, a synergistic effect could be obtained,
similarly to what observed with SAHA, further

corroborating that JNK pathway impairment is implicated
in inhibition of melanoma cell growth.
In addition to modulation of CCL2 by the
combination, we observed down-regulation of key
inflammatory mediators (i.e., IL-1α, TNFα, TGFβ and
VEGF). HDAC inhibitors have been reported to affect
the levels of the angiogenic cytokine VEGF in different
tumor types by a down-regulation of gene transcription
and activation of proteasome activity [34, 35]. In the in
vivo model we observed a decrease in VEGF transcript
after SAHA. Moreover, HDAC inhibition has been shown
to suppress TGFβ−induced epithelial to mesenchymal
transition [36]. Here, we found a down-regulation of TGFβ

Overview of the mechanism of the improved effect of the combination of temozolomide and SAHA in melanoma. The chemokines and
the immunesuppressive cells present at the tumor site are shown together with the effect of treatment. CCL2 is capable of activating
survival pathways in melanoma cells and inhibition of melanoma growth by temozolomide (TMZ)-SAHA co-treatment is achieved though
suppression of CCL2-driven signals. Beside CCL2 down-regulation, modulation of additional factors appears to contribute to the improved
antitumor efficacy.

levels in tumors from mice treated with SAHA alone and
in combination with TMZ. This could be explained by the
regulation of TGFβ-induced genes by HDAC and with the
effect on VEGF, a TGFβ−target gene, modulated at the
transcript/protein levels.
It was previously shown that HDAC inhibitors
(including SAHA) sustain the generation and activation of
Tregs and MDSC [37, 38]. Conversely, TMZ was reported
to decrease Treg frequencies in melanoma patients when
applied at low doses [39]. Tregs cells were previously
shown to act in the inhibition of the anti-melanoma
immune response [25, 40-46]. Moreover, both MDSC and
Tregs are known to express receptors for CCL2, CCL4 and
CCL5 [25, 43-47]. Therefore, we focused our attention
on these major immunosuppressive compartments in the
tumor microenvironment, MDSC and Tregs. Here, we
demonstrated that a decrease in levels of chemokines
positively correlated with reduction in the frequencies
of tumor-infiltrating of CD11b+Gr1+ immature myeloid
cells. Previously, we have intensively investigated the
distribution and function of CD11b+Gr1+ cells in primary
tumors and metastases from ret transgenic mice. We have
found that these cells are highly immunosuppressive as
reflected by a strong production of nitric oxide, enhanced
expression of arginase-1 and their ability to inhibit T
cell proliferation in an in vitro assay [48-50]. Although
we found a decrease in TGF-β levels, a leading factor
for the Treg generation [48], and in concentrations of
corresponding Treg-chemoattractive proteins in primary
tumors, amounts of tumor-infiltrating Tregs were increased
in all regimens. Such differences between distribution of
MDSC and Tregs might suggest that the pool of MDSC is
renewed in the tumor, whereas Tregs are not attracted but
converted from the conventional CD4 T cells. Differences
in infiltrate did not appear to depend on tumor size, as
specimens were harvested 5 days after 5 day treatment
from mice with advanced disease and the tumor size of
the different groups was similar.
Our findings showing that the levels of CCL2 are
decreased in our in vivo model after combined treatment,
together with a tendency of MDSC to decrease, suggested
that the combination of SAHA and TMZ might be
endowed with a direct effect on the tumor and with an
indirect effect on the microenvironment, as MDSC are
attracted by CCL2 to the tumor site [51].
In conclusion, our results showing that downregulation of CCL2-driven signals via JNK contributes to
reduce growth of melanoma cells provide a rationale for
the therapeutic advantage of the combination of SAHA
and TMZ (Figure 6E). The tumor microenvironment may
favor tumor growth inhibition because of down-regulation
of tumor-associated chronic inflammatory mediators, in
particular CCL2, and reduced MDSC recruitment. Since
CCL2 is a key modulator of cell survival and its downregulation has been related to vemurafenib efficacy [4],
our findings can be of high translational value. Thus,

therapeutic strategy based on HDAC inhibition may be
effective because of interference both with tumor cells and
with tumor microenvironment-related features.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics Statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authors’
institutional review board.

Cell lines
The human melanoma cell lines A375 (ATCC
CRL1619), 501Mel and the recently established
melanoma cell lines (LM17, LM20, LM36 LM18, LM23)
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium plus 10% FBS [52,
53]. All cell lines were authenticated using the Stem Elite
ID System (Promega) between February and August 2013,
except than A375 cell which were purchased from ATCC.
The murine melanoma cell line designated as Me1482,
established from a tumor developed in a mouse F1
hybrid carrying the ret transgene (see below), was grown
in DMEM medium containing 1 mM sodium piruvate
plus 10% FBS. The cell line which displayed a fusiform
morphology and expressed TRP2 (Supplementary Figure
S5), was characterized using a panel of PCR primers for
microsatellites polymorphisms between C57BL/6 and
BALB/C inbred strains (Supplementary Table S2).

Drugs
TMZ, SAHA and the JNK-inhibitor SP600125
(Selleck Chemicals, Aurogene Srl, Rome, Italy) were
primarily dissolved in DMSO and diluted in water. For
in vivo studies, SAHA was dissolved in DMSO/ethanol/
PBS (10:5:85) and administered in a volume of 10 mL/kg.
Human CCL2/MCP-1 monoclonal neutralizing antibody
[54] (cat. 24822, R&D System, SPACE Import Export srl,
Milan, Italy), was reconstituted in sterile PBS at 0.5 mg/
ml. Recombinant human MCP-1/CCL2 (Peprotech, tebubio SRL, Milan, Italy) was reconstituted in sterile water
at 0.02 mg/ml.

Cellular and biochemical assays
Cell sensitivity to drugs was measured by growthinhibition assays [55]. Twenty-four h after seeding cells
were exposed to drugs for 72 h. After treatments cells
were counted with a cell counter. At least 3 independent
4524

Oncotarget

Antitumor activity studies

experiments were performed for each mode of treatment.
Twenty-four h after seeding cells were exposed to TMZ,
SAHA or their combination for 48 h or longer. After the
treatment floating and adherent cells were harvested and
processed for apoptosis evaluation by TUNEL (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany). MCP-1/CCL2 levels in murine
and human melanoma cell lines were measured by ELISA
according to manufacturer’s protocols (ELISA KIT MCP1, LiStarFish, Milan, Italy).

C57BL/6 mice carrying the human ret trangene
under the control of mouse metallothionein-I promoter,
kindly provided by Dr. T. Dragani, were obtained as
described previously [56]. Mice were maintained in
rooms with controlled temperature and humidity and had
free access to food and water. Experiments were approved
by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of
the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan, according
to international guidelines. The general performance of
mice was monitored biweekly and spontaneous tumor
development was assessed macroscopically; for ethical
reasons, animals were sacrificed prior to appearance of
signs of suffering. To carry out antitumor activity studies
N3/RET mice were crossed to C57BL/6 female mice
(Charles River, Calco, Italy) and the resulting F1 mice
were genotyped following DNA extraction from a tail
fragment to select for the presence of the ret transgene.
Ret transgenic mice developed melanoma starting from 6
weeks. Six-seven week old 48 F1 mice carrying the ret
transgene showing no signs of macroscopic tumors were
used for antitumor activity studies and were assigned to
four groups according to a randomization list. The mice
were treated (qdx5/wx3w) with a) 50 mg/kg TMZ or b)
100 mg/kg SAHA or c) their combination or d) vehicle.
All controls displayed macroscopic evidence of disease
(i.e., subcutaneous nodules, exophthalmus) within 44 days
from the experiment start.

Preparation of tumor lysates
To examine biological response to treatments
mice with advanced disease (age = 155-172 days) were
used. Mice were treated with vehicle, SAHA, TMZ or
their combination for 5 days and they were sacrificed 5
days later. Tumor cells were processed for total protein
extraction. Briefly, protein lysates were prepared
from frozen tumor samples pulverized by the MikroDismembrator II (B. Brown Biotech International,
Melsungen, Germany) in Lysis Buffer 15 (from mouse
Phospho-RTK Proteome Profiler, R&D System) added
with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal amounts
of lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and then
transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were incubated
with antibodies to phosho-PDGF receptor (Tyr849 and
Tyr857; cat. 3170, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA), phospho-RET (Tyr1062; cat. sc-20252-R, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), JNK2 and phosphoJNK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185; cat. MAB 1846 and AF 1205,
R&D System).

Gene expression analyses

Western blot analysis

TaqMan® Arrays (Mouse Immune Panel, Life
Technologies) and qReal-Time PCR assay are described
in Supplementary Methods.

Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and
blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were preblocked in PBS containing 5% (w/v) dried non-fat milk
and then incubated overnight at 4°C with antibodies to
JNK2 and phospho-JNK1/2 (R&D System), AKT2 and
phospho-AKT2 (cat. AF 23151 and MAB 887; R&D
System), NF-kB (cat. sc-109, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and IKB-a (cat. ab 7545, Abcam Limited, Cambridge,
UK). Anti-tubulin, or anti-vinculin antibodies (cat.
T9026, and cat. V9131, SIGMA Chemicals Co.) were
used as control for the protein loading. Antibody binding
to blots was detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech., Cologno Monzese, Italy). For
Proteome Profiler Antibody Arrays, cell lysates were
prepared as described by the manufacturer (R&D System).
Labscan imaging technology and software (GE Healthcare,
Wauwatosa, Wisconsin) was used for Western immunoblot
anlysis visualization. Band intensities were quantified by
ImageJ software by pixel-integrated intensity.

Methods section.

Flow cytometry
Tumors, bone marrow, spleen and lymph nodes were
harvested into cold PBS, cut into pieces and mechanically
disaggregated. Single cell suspensions were obtained by
mechanical disaggregation of the specimens that after
harvesting from mice were immediately transferred into
PBS, cut into pieces and the obtained cell suspensions
filtered through 50 µm cell strainers (BD Biosciences).
After counting, cells were viably frozen in 10% DMSO
in FBS. Thawed cells were washed in PBS and treated
with Fc-blocking solution (rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32
antibody, BD Biosciences) followed by the incubation

CD45.2-PerCP-Cy5.5 (cat. 552950) from BD Biosciences.
To stain FoxP3 cells were fixed and permeabilized using
FoxP3 staining set (eBioscience) prior to the addition
of the Foxp3-PE mAbs (cat.72-5775-40). Acquisition
was performed by multi-color flow cytometry using a
FACSCantoII with FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences),
with dead cells exclusion based on scatter profile. FlowJo
software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR) was used to analyze at
least 100,000 events per sample.

Bio-Plex assay
Snap frozen primary tumor and LN samples were
mechanically disrupted and treated by lysis solution (BioRad). Protein concentration in lysates was determined
using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). After sonication, samples
were centrifuged at 4,500 g for 6 min at 4 °C. Protein
concentration in the supernatant was determined using
Bradford assay and adjusted to 1000 µg/ml using serum
diluent (both Bio-Rad). Amounts of inflammatory factors
in tissue lysates (obtained from tissues from mice treated
for 5 days and sacrificed 5 days later) were measured by
multiplex technology (Bio-Rad).Transforming growth
factor (TGF)-β1 was measured using a single plex kit
(Millipore) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
