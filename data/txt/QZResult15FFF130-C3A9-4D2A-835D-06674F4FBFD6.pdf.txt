Abstract
Most breast cancers expressing the estrogen receptor a (ERa) are treated successfully with the receptor
antagonist tamoxifen (TAM), but many of these tumors recur. Elevated expression of the homeodomain
transcription factor HOXB13 correlates with TAM-resistance in ERa-positive (ERþ) breast cancer, but little
is known regarding the underlying mechanism. Our comprehensive evaluation of HOX gene expression using
tiling microarrays, with validation, showed that distant metastases from TAM-resistant patients also displayed
high HOXB13 expression, suggesting a role for HOXB13 in tumor dissemination and survival. Here we show that
HOXB13 confers TAM resistance by directly downregulating ERa transcription and protein expression. HOXB13
elevation promoted cell proliferation in vitro and growth of tumor xenografts in vivo. Mechanistic investigations
showed that HOXB13 transcriptionally upregulated interleukin (IL)-6, activating the mTOR pathway via STAT3
phosphorylation to promote cell proliferation and ﬁbroblast recruitment. Accordingly, mTOR inhibition
suppressed ﬁbroblast recruitment and proliferation of HOXB13-expressing ERþ breast cancer cells and tumor
xenografts, alone or in combination with TAM. Taken together, our results establish a function for HOXB13 in
TAM resistance through direct suppression of ERa and they identify the IL-6 pathways as mediator of disease
progression and recurrence. Cancer Res; 73(17); 5449–58. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Approximately 60% to 70% of breast cancers express estrogen receptor a (ERa) and/or progesterone receptor and merit
the use of hormone therapies, such as the estrogen receptor
antagonist tamoxifen (TAM; ref. 1). Use of TAM has improved
outcomes for patients with these tumors, but in 30% to 40% of
these patients the cancers recur, usually as distant metastasis,
and the majority of these patients will die of their cancer. High

expression of the gene HOXB13 and concomitant low expression of IL17BR have been found in multiple studies to predict
TAM-R and disease recurrence in patients with ER-positive
(ERþ) breast cancer (2–5).
The HOX genes encode a family of highly conserved transcription factors that normally regulate temporospatial development of the extremities and organs. Aberrant expression of
these genes in different tissues have been associated with
tumorigenesis (6). In breast cancer, low expression of HOXA5
and HOXA10 is associated with decreased p53 expression (7, 8),
whereas high expression of HOXB7 or HOXB13 has been
associated with aggressive disease (3, 9). However, the mechanism by which HOXB13 promotes aggressive disease and
TAM-R in ERþ breast cancer has not been deﬁned. Without
understanding these mechanisms, therapeutic alternatives for
patients with TAM-R, HOXB13-expressing ERþ breast cancer
cannot be rationally devised for greatest efﬁcacy and minimal
toxicity.
A comprehensive HOX cluster expression tiling array analysis of primary ERþ breast tumors and distant metastases (10)
supported the involvement of HOXB13 in dissemination of
disease following resistance to hormonal therapy. Here, we
validate these ﬁndings and provide insights into the mechanism whereby HOXB13 mediates TAM-R and metastasis.

cells, leading to activation of the AKT and mTOR pathways and
also stimulating stromal recruitment. We also show that
targeting these pathways with the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin,
suppresses the growth of TAM-R, HOXB13-expressing tumors.

Matrigel invasion assays
Invasion assays were conducted in BD Biocoat Matrigel (24well format) Invasion Chambers per manufacturer protocol.
Experiments were conducted in triplicate.

Materials and Methods

Promoter-luciferase reporter assay
MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000/DNA complexes (Invitrogen) of p-HOXB13, promoter-luciferase construct (pGL2; Promega), and b-galactosidase (bGAL) plasmid, and incubated for 24 hours. Luciferase
and bGAL activity were measured per protocol (Promega).
Assays were conducted in triplicate in a single experiment, and
then as 3 independent experiments.

Human tissue specimens
Normal breast epithelial preparations (organoids), primary breast tumors, and distant metastases were accessed
with approval from the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Review Board, and RNA extracted as previously
described (10). Detailed methods are presented in the Supplementary Methods section.
Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR validation of
gene expression
A total of 200 ng of RNA from primary tissue samples, or 1 mg
of RNA from cell lines, were reverse-transcribed using Superscript III (Invitrogen), per manufacturer protocol; 1 mL of yield
was used per PCR. Taqman Gene Expression Assays for
HOXB13 (Hs00197189_m1) and GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1)
were used as primers and gene-speciﬁc ﬂuorescent probes for
PCR, using RampTaq polymerase (Denville Scientiﬁc) and
supplied buffer. qPCR was conducted per manufacturer protocol, using the Applied Biosystem 7500 Real-Time PCR System
for 40 cycles. A detection threshold of 0.01 was set for determination of Ct for each reaction. For each sample, qPCR was
conducted to measure HOXB13 and GAPDH expression; each
sample was tested in triplicate. The DDCt method (GAPDH
used for normalization) was used to determine the expression
of HOXB13 in each reaction separately, using average lowest
expression in organoid tissue as baseline. Relative expression
was calculated as 2^(DDCt), and the 3 expression values
averaged to determine HOXB13 expression in each sample.
Primer compositions are presented in Supplementary Table S1.
Cell culture, plasmids, and cell line constructs
The breast cell lines MCF10A, MCF7, T47D, and BT474 were
provided by NCI (IBC-45 panel) through the American Type
Culture Collection; the ﬁbroblast cell line NIH3T3 was
obtained from lab stocks. MCF10A cells were grown in
DMEM/F12 media (Mediatech) supplemented with 5% horse
serum, 20 ng/mL EGF, 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 100 ng/mL
cholera toxin, 10 mg/mL insulin, 50 IU/mL penicillin, and
50 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate. MCF7 cells were grown in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Gemini Bio-Products), and T47D and BT474
cells were grown in RPMI media with 10% FBS. NIH3T3 cell
lines were grown in DMEM with 10% normal calf serum.
Plasmids containing the full length cDNA of human HOXB13
in the pLPCX retroviral vector (pHOXB13), the empty pLPCX
vector (Clontech), 2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral
constructs targeting HOXB13 mRNA (shHOXB13), and scramble shRNA construct (PLKO.1/Thermo Scientiﬁc) were used
to generate viral supernatant for overexpression or knockdown of HOXB13 in cell lines. Generation of HOXB13-modulated cell lines by retroviral infection is described in the
Supplementary Methods.

Six- to 8-week-old female athymic nude mice were used,
and study approved by Johns Hopkins Animal Use Committee. E2 pellets were implanted subcutaneously on day 3 in 6
mice. On day 0, 3  106 of the indicated tumor cells were
injected subcutaneously into both ﬂanks of each mouse. In a
second experiment, mice were implanted with E2 pellets on
day 3. On day 0, the indicated cancer cells were injected
into the 4th mammary fat pads (mfp; 1.5  106 cells) or
subcutaneously (3  106 cells) suspended in 0.1 mL of 1:1
PBS/Matrigel (BD Biosciences) in separate sets of mice.
After 3 weeks, 6 mice each with mfp or subcutaneous tumors
were treated with either (i) TAM implants subcutaneously;

9 mg/kg on day 21, then 3 mg/kg every other day, (iii) TAM
implants plus rapamycin, or (iv) no additional treatment.
Tumor growth was measured weekly. Mice were euthanized
after 6 weeks and tumors harvested. Tumor volume was
estimated by the calculation V ¼ (length  width  height 
0.5236) mm3. Details are presented in the Supplementary
Methods section.

Mechanism of HOXB13-Mediated Tamoxifen Resistance

Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses, except the analysis of the tiling arrays
and the NKI dataset, were conducted using GraphPad Prism
version 5.04 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The NKI dataset (288
patients with ERþ breast cancer) uses a custom Rosetta
oligonucleotide, on which HOXB13 and IL-6 are each represented by 2 probes. Spearman rank-based correlation coefﬁcients were used to measure association, assessing signiﬁcance
using a permutation test.
For all reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
analyses and the invasion assays, one-way ANOVA analysis
using the Kruskal–Wallis test was conducted to assess significant difference among groups, as well as two-tailed Student t
test to compare speciﬁc pairs. For survival analyses, the logrank/Mantel–Cox test was conducted to calculate signiﬁcant
difference in survival. For sensitivity of cell lines to rapamycin,
two-way ANOVA testing (cell line and drug concentration) was
conducted, with Bonferroni posttest to compare cell lines. For
tumor xenograft studies, tumor growth inhibition was analyzed using a mixed effects model by assuming an exchangeable covariance structure to account for correlation among
measurements taken on the same animal. Tukey's procedure
was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. For all other
assays, two-tailed Student t tests with unpaired values were
conducted.

Results
HOXB13 is overexpressed in distant metastases and
associated with disease recurrence and death
We evaluated HOX gene expression in ERþ breast cancer
and distant metastatic disease through analysis of HOX tiling
arrays (10) on normal breast organoids, primary tumors, and
distant metastases. HOXB13 was overexpressed in the majority
of tumor samples, including 5 of 6 metastases, compared with
normal organoids (10). This ﬁnding was validated by RT-qPCR
using a panel of ERþ primary tumors from long-term breast
cancer survivors and nonsurvivors, and 14 metastases from
multiple sites from 11 breast cancer patients who had undergone rapid autopsy for tissue donation (Fig. 1A). Compared
with normal organoids, each group of tumors had signiﬁcantly
higher expression of HOXB13 (P < 0.007), and tumors from
nonsurvivors and metastases had signiﬁcantly higher expression than those from survivors (P ¼ 0.009).
HOXB13 expression correlates with proliferation,
resistance to TAM, and estrogen-independent growth
To study the mechanism by which HOXB13 mediates TAMR, we examined HOXB13 expression in breast cell lines. We
showed that the immortalized normal breast cell line MCF10A
had HOXB13 expression comparable to levels seen in primary
normal breast organoid preparations (P ¼ 0.9). Consistent with
HOXB13 expression in primary tumors from survivors, expression in ERþ, TAM-sensitive (TAM-S) cell lines, MCF7 and T47D,
were 4- to 8-fold higher than MCF10A. In contrast, HOXB13
expression in an ERþ, TAM-R cell line, BT474, was 400- to 500fold higher than MCF10A, consistent with the level of expression
in primary tumors from nonsurvivors (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
In MCF7 and T47D, forced expression of HOXB13 raised levels of

www.aacrjournals.org

HOXB13 to within the range of expression seen in tumor
samples from nonsurvivors (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In BT474
cells, lentiviral infection of 2 shRNA constructs resulted in
reduced HOXB13 expression to 10% (shHOXB13 #1) and 5%
(shHOXB13 #2) of the vector control of BT474 (shScramble) and
below the median HOXB13 expression seen in tumors from
survivors (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
To determine if HOXB13 expression correlates with TAM-R,
cells were treated with 1 to 5 mmol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OH TAM, the active metabolite of TAM) in vitro, for 48 hours.
Both the MCF7-HOXB13 cell pools with high HOXB13 expression had signiﬁcantly higher survival at 2 and 5 mmol/L
4OH-TAM compared with vector control (Fig. 1B). Conversely,
BT474-shHOXB13 cell pools, with low HOXB13 expression, had
lower survival (Fig. 1C). Growth phenotypes of these cells were
also tested in vivo. ERþ cell lines require estradiol supplementation (E2) to grow as xenografts and are TAM-S, which causes
growth arrest and tumor regression. MCF7-HOXB13 cells
injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice formed
tumors that proliferated without E2, whereas the MCF7-vector
control cells did not (Supplementary Fig. S1C), suggesting that
HOXB13-expressing cells had lost dependence on E2 for
growth. To test response of the tumors to TAM, E2 pellets
were implanted into mice 3 days before xenograft implantation; after 3 weeks the pellets were replaced with TAM pellets.
MCF7-HOXB13 xenografts grew faster and continued to grow
despite TAM, whereas MCF-vector xenograft growth was
suppressed by TAM (Fig. 1D). Conversely, xenografts of
TAM-R, BT474-vector control cells continued to grow whereas
BT474-shHOXB13-2 xenografts regressed upon TAM treatment (Fig. 1F). Thus, the phenotype of both the HOXB13overexpressing and -depleted breast cancer cells reﬂect the
TAM-R phenotype associated with HOXB13 overexpression in
vitro and in clinical studies.
HOXB13 directly suppresses ERa transcription
Despite extensive evidence for a strong correlation between
HOXB13 and TAM-R, few studies have addressed the mechanisms linking the two factors. ERa activation with E2 in cultured
breast cancer cells decreased HOXB13 mRNA levels (11). Conversely, ERa suppression with TAM in breast cells resulted in
increased levels of HOXB13 mRNA (11). In ovarian cancer cells, a
reverse phenomenon was reported—HOXB13 expression
enhanced expression of ERa protein and ERE-linked luciferase
activity (12). We investigated the correlation between HOXB13
and ERa in our cell line models. By Western blot analysis, we
observed that both T47D-HOXB13 and MCF7-HOXB13 pools
showed reduced expression of ERa (Fig. 2A). Conversely, two
pools of BT474-shHOXB13 cells showed increased expression of
ERa (Fig. 2A). In MCF7-TMR1 and MCF7-TMR2 cells (grown for
more than 6 months in 0.1 or 1 mmol/L 4-OH TAM, respectively),
ERa mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and protein
expression (Fig. 2B) was signiﬁcantly lower compared with
parental MCF7 cells. HOXB13 caused this downregulation, as
shRNA-mediated depletion of HOXB13 expression in MCF7TMR1 cells resulted in increased ERa protein (Fig. 2B) and
mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2B) expression. These changes are
reﬂected in the sensitivity of these cells to TAM. Treatment of

MCF7-TMR1 cells with 1 to 5 mmol/L 4-OH TAM for 48 hours
had little effect on cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
However, the MCF7-TMR1 shHOXB13#1 and #2 cells regained
sensitivity to 4-OH TAM (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Thus,
HOXB13 overexpression and TAM-R are closely linked; reducing
HOXB13 levels in the cells confers TAM sensitivity.
The negative correlation between HOXB13 and ERa expression led us to investigate if HOXB13 acts directly upon the ERa
promoter to repress expression. ERa promoter-luciferase constructs were made, from 4,100 to 245 bp of the transcriptional
start site (TSS) of ERa (Fig. 2C). Cotransfection experiments
showed that HOXB13 signiﬁcantly suppressed ERa promoterluciferase activity in all constructs as compared with empty
vector, and identiﬁed a consensus HOX-binding sequence, TAAT,

within 245 bp of the TSS. Deletion of 10 base pairs inclusive of
the putative HOX-binding site resulted in loss of the suppressive
effect of HOXB13 on ERa promoter (Fig. 3C). To show direct
interaction between HOXB13 and the ERa promoter, we conducted ChIP for HOXB13 in the MCF7-HOXB13 cell line. Three
regions of the ERa promoter with putative HOX-binding
sequences (Fig. 2D) were tested; HOXB13 speciﬁcally bound to
a region extending from 288 to þ46 bp. Compared with MCF7vector cells, ChIP using an anti-HOXB13 antibody in MCF7HOXB13 cells showed speciﬁc enrichment for binding to this
region, in contrast to other regions of the promoter (Fig. 2D).
Consistent with the presence of a repressive complex, ChIP for
the corepressor, NCOR, showed enriched binding to this region
of the ERa promoter in the MCF7-HOXB13 cells (Fig. 2F).

HOXB13 expression is associated with increased stroma
in MCF7 xenografts and increased ﬁbroblast
recruitment in vitro, and acts by directly promoting
IL-6 expression
Because the cell lines with higher HOXB13 expression grow
faster as xenografts, and display TAM-R and E2-independent
proliferation, HOXB13 is likely utilizing ER-independent pathways to potentiate these phenotypes. We also noted a striking
difference in the histology of the tumor xenografts-MCF7vector control xenografts grow with little stroma, whereas
tumors of MCF7-HOXB13 cells had signiﬁcantly larger stromal
component interspersed among the cancer cells (Fig. 3A).
Based on the vast literature of stromal recruitment and participation in breast cancer aggressiveness (13–15), we entertained the notion that the factors that drive proliferation in
HOXB13-expressing tumors may include those that affect their
microenvironment.
Genes implicated in different aspects of lymphocyte, macrophage, and stromal recruitment and cellular invasion
include IL6, IL8, CXCL12, CXCR4, and MMP1 (16–18). RT-

qPCR was conducted on RNA from the MCF7-HOXB13 and
BT474-HOXB13 shRNA cells and their vector controls, to
analyze mRNA expression levels of these genes (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). Of those tested, IL6 showed consistent
patterns of direct correlation of expression with HOXB13
across both sets of cell lines (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S3C
and S3D), and MCF7-TMR cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3E
and S3F).
To evaluate the ability of HOXB13-expressing cancer cells to
attract ﬁbroblasts and to deﬁne the role of IL-6 in this function,
we conducted cell invasion/chemotaxis assays. NIH3T3 mouse

major stromal attractant was IL-6.
To evaluate if HOXB13 was directly driving IL6 expression,
deletion constructs of IL6 promoter-luciferase plasmids
(248 to 1787 bp of the TSS) were constructed. Signiﬁcantly
increased luciferase activity was observed with constructs 439
bp or less (Fig. 3F) in MCF7 cells transiently cotransfected with
pHOXB13, compared with empty vector. Deletion of 10 base

resulted in loss of the HOXB13 effect (Fig. 3F). These results
suggested that HOXB13 binds directly to the IL6 promoter and
upregulates its expression. ChIP analysis for HOXB13 identiﬁed
a region 225 to þ15 bp of the TSS that was enriched for
binding in MCF7-HOXB13 cells (Fig. 3G) as compared with
vector control cells (Fig. 3H). Also, ChIP analysis showed
enrichment at the IL6 promoter of 2 HOX cofactors, PBX1 and
MEIS1, but not of the corepressor NCOR (Fig. 3I). These ﬁndings
support the hypothesis that HOXB13 binds the IL6 promoter
directly and promotes IL6 transcription.

Mechanism of HOXB13-Mediated Tamoxifen Resistance

were grown in conditioned media from MCF7-vector or MCF7HOXB13 cells after treatment with either anti-IL-6 or IL-6R
blocking antibody, followed by immunoblot analysis of pSTAT3 (Y705) and p-AKT (S473). We found phosphorylation
of STAT3 and AKT was blocked despite treatment with medium from MCF7-HOXB13 cells (Fig. 4B).
Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, has been shown to
suppress IL-6–driven pathways (21, 25). If so, rapamycin would
suppress phenotypes that are associated with high expression
of HOXB13. Indeed, both MCF7-HOXB13 and T47D-HOXB13
cells were sensitive to rapamycin, with signiﬁcantly decreased
viability compared with vector-control cells with low HOXB13
expression (Fig. 4C and D). Next, we tested if rapamycin could
block ﬁbroblast recruitment by the cancer cells in culture.
Cancer cell lines were grown in complete medium with and

HOXB13-driven IL-6 expression activates AKT and
mTOR, and this activation can be blocked by rapamycin
IL-6 promotes tumorigenesis through multiple mechanisms,
including cell proliferation and stromal recruitment (21–23),
and causes these effects, in part, through phosphorylation of
AKT and activation of mTOR-mediated pathways (21, 24).
Consistent with high IL-6 activity, Western blot analysis of
the MCF7 and BT474 cell line sets showed that, in MCF7HOXB13 and BT474 cells, STAT3, AKT, and downstream
targets of mTOR were phosphorylated (Fig. 4A, left). Conversely, knockdown of HOXB13 in BT474 cells resulted in slight
decrease in p-STAT-3 but a marked decrease in p-AKT, pp70S6K, and p-4EBP1, the downstream effectors of the mTOR
pathway (Fig. 4A, right). To determine if the stromal recruitment effects are largely mediated by IL-6, human ﬁbroblasts

HOXB13 expression correlates directly with IL6
expression and inversely with ERa (ESR1) expression in
primary tumor samples and is associated with poor
prognosis
To study the correlation between HOXB13 and IL6 expression and whether a combination of these markers might
provide better predictive and prognostic signiﬁcance compared to either one alone, we analyzed an independent dataset
of tumors from 288 patients with ERþ breast cancer (26). As
supported by multiple publications (3–5), HOXB13 expression
was signiﬁcantly prognostic of 5-year overall survival (OS; Fig.
5A; HR ¼ 1.29, P ¼ 4  104). Patients whose primary tumors
had high HOXB13 expression had a signiﬁcantly higher risk of
disease recurrence [HR ¼ 3.55; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI),
1.068–11.84] and death from disease (HR ¼ 3.438; 95% CI,
1.036–11.41) compared with those with low HOXB13 expression. Next, we evaluated the role of IL6 expression, in relation to
HOXB13 expression, as a clinical biomarker. High IL6 expression was prognostic of 5-year OS (Fig. 5B; HR ¼ 1.175, P ¼
0.0041). Furthermore, a combination of IL6 and HOXB13
expression was signiﬁcantly prognostic of OS and more powerful than either gene alone (Fig. 5C; HR ¼ 1.228, P ¼ 1.75 
105). These ﬁndings all support the role of upregulation of
HOXB13 and IL6 in disease aggression and TAM-R, ERþ breast
cancer.

Discussion
Numerous studies have showed the predictive value of
HOXB13 expression in ERþ breast cancer (2, 3, 11), establishing
it as a potentially useful clinical biomarker. Prior work had
found HOXB13 mRNA expression correlates inversely with
ESR1 expression in breast cancer and, in ERþ TAM-S cell lines,
E2 suppresses HOXB13 expression (11). However, no studies

Rapamycin can inhibit proliferation of HOXB13expressing ERþ breast cancer cells in vivo
Given the suppressive effect of rapamycin on HOXB13expressing ERþ cells in vitro, we tested its effect in vivo. Because
HOXB13-expressing cells still expressed low levels of ERa, we
also evaluated if there would be a combinatorial effect of using
rapamycin with TAM. MCF7-HOXB13 xenografts were grown
for 3 weeks. Then mice were treated with either rapamycin,
TAM, or rapamycin and TAM for 3 additional weeks. In MCF7HOXB13 xenografts grown in the mammary fat pad (Fig. 4G) or
subcutaneously (Supplementary Fig. S4A), treatment with rapamycin alone, or together with TAM caused signiﬁcant tumor
regression, and was signiﬁcantly more effective than TAM alone
(weeks 5 and 6, P < 0.003; Supplementary Tables S3–S6).

have examined the mechanisms by which HOXB13 contributes
to disease aggression, speciﬁcally in TAM-R and metastatic
recurrence. An evaluation of HOXB13 function in TAM-R
breast cancer is critical to identifying new therapeutic targets.
We conducted the ﬁrst such examination of HOXB13 in breast
cancer and showed its role in aggressive disease, consistent
with clinical studies.
For the ﬁrst time, we have assessed HOXB13 in distant
metastatic tumors. We conﬁrmed tumors from nonsurvivors
had signiﬁcantly higher mRNA levels of HOXB13 compared
with those from survivors, and HOXB13 expression signiﬁcantly predicts disease recurrence and death from disease. The

Mechanism of HOXB13-Mediated Tamoxifen Resistance

using only one body site was not possible while maintaining
statistical power, but we are now evaluating the role of
HOXB13 in metastasis to speciﬁc anatomic sites.
We showed that HOXB13 suppressed but did not fully
abrogate ERa expression, and it also promoted proliferation
and TAM-R in vivo, consistent with the association of HOXB13
expression with metastatic disease recurrence in patients
despite treatment with TAM. The experimental evidence and
the increased stromal component in HOXB13 tumor xenografts suggested HOXB13 promoted tumor formation and
disease recurrence also by promoting other pathways, including proliferation and stromal recruitment.
An extensive body of literature is emerging that supports
cross-talk and cooperation between stromal cells and tumor
cells at multiple levels such as—the soluble factors elicited by
tumor cells and those in response by the stromal cells, changes
in the extracellular matrix, and alterations in cell adhesion,
which collectively lead to a microenvironment conducive to
tumor progression (27, 28). A major cell type that alters the
tumor milieu is the stromal ﬁbroblast. To study the notable
stromal recruitment visible in HOXB13 overexpressing tumors,
and to decipher the role of IL-6–mediated pathways in this
function, we modeled the in vivo conditions in tissue culture.
We showed the ability of normal murine and human ﬁbroblasts
to migrate toward conditioned medium from HOXB13 overexpressing tumor cells, but not from vector control cells; and
that the action was blunted by pretreating the ﬁbroblasts with
anti-IL-6 antibodies (Fig. 3). Although this approach replicated
the recruitment of na€ve ﬁbroblasts to the tumor site by IL-6
secreted by tumor cells, it would also be important to study, in
the future, the molecular and biological differences between
cancer-associated-ﬁbroblasts (CAF) existing in the tumors and
in normal ﬁbroblasts in the breast, and how CAF action relates
to hormone resistance mediated by HOXB13.
In this study, we conﬁrmed HOXB13-directed transcriptional activation of IL6, a common mediator of stromal recruitment
IL6 is an activator of the AKT pathway, and this activation is
suppressed by mTOR inhibitors (21, 24, 25). We speciﬁcally
showed that the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin can suppress the
proliferation of ERþ, HOXB13-expressing cells in vitro and in
vivo, alone or in combination with TAM. This work led us to
conclude that HOXB13 expression in ERþ breast cancer cells
not only allows for estrogen-independent proliferation and
tumorigenesis but makes the cells dependent on mTOR-mediated pathways for this proliferation. These pathways need to be
more fully deﬁned to identify potential mechanisms of multidrug resistance. Nonetheless, we show that the use of rapamycin with TAM suppresses ERþ, HOXB13-expressing breast
cancer growth better than either drug alone and can even cause
tumor regression in vivo.

In the past year, two major clinical trials showed the efﬁcacy
of everolimus, a second generation mTOR inhibitor, in combination with anti-estrogen therapy in recurrent ERþ, antiendocrine-resistant breast cancer (29, 30). Our ﬁndings provide
a mechanistic explanation for this beneﬁt. There are currently
3 clinically available tests, including the HOXB13/IL17BR
RT-qPCR/MGI test known as the Breast Cancer Index
(Biotheranostics), that have been well-validated as predictive
of TAM-resistance in ERþ tumors. However, no treatment
option has been previously suggested for those patients for
whom TAM alone would be an unsuccessful treatment. Our
work provides a novel and logical mechanistic basis for the use
of everolimus with TAM for treatment of ERþ breast tumors
with high HOXB13 expression at initial diagnosis. This combination is particularly attractive as everolimus is well studied
and well tolerated in humans. Our work provides a rationale
for clinical studies to evaluate the use of the Breast Cancer
Index to recommend combined use of an mTOR inhibitor
and TAM at diagnosis to prevent disease recurrence. These
studies should also inform the rapid development of new
therapies for TAM-R, HOXB13-expressing ERþ breast cancers.
