Abstract
Radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is the treatment
of choice for glioblastoma and locally advanced lung cancer,
but radioresistance of these two types of cancer remains a
significant therapeutic hindrance. To identify molecular
target(s) for radiosensitization, we screened a small interfering RNA (siRNA) library targeting all protein kinases and E3
ubiquitin ligases in the human genome and identified tumor
necrosis factor receptor–associated factor 2 (TRAF2). Silencing of TRAF2 using siRNA caused a significant growth
suppression of glioblastoma U251 cells and moderately
sensitized these radioresistant cells to radiation. Overexpression of a really interesting new gene (RING)–deleted dominant-negative TRAF2 mutant also conferred radiosensitivity,
whereas overexpression of wild-type (WT) TRAF2 significantly
protected cells from radiation-induced killing. Likewise,
siRNA silencing of TRAF2 in radioresistant lung cancer
H1299 cells caused growth suppression and radiosensitization,
whereas overexpression of WT TRAF2 enhanced radioresistance in a RING ligase-dependent manner. Moreover, siRNA
silencing of TRAF2 in UM-SCC-1 head and neck cancer cells
also conferred radiosensitization. Further support for the role
of TRAF2 in cancer comes from the observations that TRAF2
is overexpressed in both lung adenocarcinoma tissues and
multiple lung cancer cell lines. Importantly, TRAF2 expression
was very low in normal bronchial epithelial NL20 cells, and
TRAF2 silencing had a minimal effect on NL20 growth and
radiation sensitivity. Mechanistically, TRAF2 silencing blocks
the activation of the nuclear factor-KB signaling pathway
and down-regulates several G2-M cell cycle control proteins,
resulting in enhanced G2-M arrest, growth suppression,
and radiosensitization. Our studies suggest that TRAF2 is
an attractive drug target for anticancer therapy and
radiosensitization. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7570–8]

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme is the deadliest and most common
type of human primary brain tumor with a median survival of less
than 1 year (1). Unfortunately, this prognosis has not changed
significantly over the past 2 decades despite advances in

neurosurgery, radiation, and chemotherapy (2). Two characteristic
features of glioblastoma play a major role in the deadly nature
of the disease. First, glioblastoma cells extensively invade the
normally functioning brain, which essentially prevents a surgical
cure. Second, glioblastoma is resistant to all the current therapeutic
modalities, including radiotherapy (1). External beam radiotherapy
remains an important local treatment modality in both high- and
low-grade gliomas. However, its effectiveness is modest due to the
radioresistance of these tumors observed in the clinic (3). Although
preclinical and correlative clinical data suggested an involvement
of an epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway in the
radioresistance of glioblastoma (4), the mechanism for such
extreme radioresistance was not well understood. Laboratory
studies have found that glioblastoma cell lines are very resistant to
radiation-induced apoptosis due to failure in p53 and PTEN
signaling pathways (5, 6).
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the
United States and throughout the world, claiming more than
1 million lives each year (7). Although significant progress has
been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms
of lung carcinogenesis, the therapeutic interventions for lung
cancer have achieved only modest benefits (8). For non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), radiotherapy as a curative modality
has been disappointing as evidenced by low tumor response
rate and a 5-year survival rate of only 7% to 10% (8). Two major
issues that limit the effectiveness of radiotherapy of NSCLC are
radioresistance of the tumor and radiation-induced toxicity to
normal tissues such as the lung and esophagus. The mechanism
of radioresistance of NSCLC remains unclear, although some
studies have shown the potential involvement of either p53
mutations (9), overexpression of survival genes such as XIAP and
survivin (10), or activation of the Akt pathway (11). Presently,
there are no molecularly targeted therapies that have been
effectively combined with radiation for the treatment of lung
cancer. Thus, the identification of gene(s) responsible for carrying
resistance would be of great importance to discover drugs that
enhance sensitivity to radiation.
One approach for identifying targets that may play a role in
radioresistance is through the screening of small interfering RNA
(siRNA) libraries. Here, we describe a siRNA-based screen to
identify genes that confer radioresistance. Using a siRNA library
targeting the kinases and E3 ubiquitin ligases, tumor necrosis
factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) was identified
as a candidate radiosensitizing target. TRAF2 belongs to a family
with seven protein members (TRAF1–7) that play a pivotal role in
diverse biological processes, including immunity, inflammation,
and apoptosis (12, 13). Among TRAF family members, TRAF2 is

TRAF2 as an Anticancer and Radiosensitizing Target

Figure 1. Identification of TRAF2 as a radiosensitizing target: glioblastoma U251 cells are radioresistant. U251 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and irradiated
at the indicated doses 24 h later. Cell viability was measured 48 h after radiation by ATPlite assay. A, top, results from three independent experiments, each run in
quadruplet; bottom, flow chart for siRNA library screening in U251 cells. TRAF2 silencing inhibits cell growth and sensitizes cells to radiation as measured by 96-well
ATPlite short-term assay (B) or standard clonogenic assay (C ): U251 cells were infected with lenti-si-Cont (from scrambled sequence) or lenti-si-TRAF2 (targeting
TRAF2). B, top, cells were harvested 72 h after infection and subjected to Western blot analysis. TRAF2-silenced cells, along with control cells, were assessed for
growth rate using 96-well assay up to 5 d after no radiation (middle ) or radiation with indicated doses (bottom ). C, TRAF2-silenced cells were subjected to standard
clonogenic assay for plating efficiency in six-well plate without (top ) or with (middle ) radiation. U251 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA oligonucleotide
against TRAF2. Bottom, cells were exposed to radiation 48 h after transfection when TRAF2 was silenced and subjected to standard clonogenic assay. Colony number
was counted 9 d after radiation, and surviving fraction was calculated and plotted after comparison with 0 Gy corresponding controls. SER was calculated as
described (22, 49). Points, mean from three independent experiments, each run in quadruplicate (B) or duplicate (C ); bars, SE.

unique as an adaptor protein that mediates several signaling
pathways leading to apoptosis protection (see refs. 14, 15 for
reviews). TRAF2 consists of 501 amino acids with three distinct
domains: the COOH-terminal domain responsible for homodimerzation and heterodimerzation of the TRAF proteins, four repeats of
zinc finger domain, and a really interesting new gene (RING) finger
domain at the NH2 terminus required for its E3 ubiquitin ligase
activity (16). We found that TRAF2 silencing remarkably inhibited
growth of glioblastoma U251 and lung cancer H1299 cells and
sensitized several cancer lines to radiation. These anticancer effects
are mediated at least in part through blocking nuclear factor-nB
(NF-nB) activation and targeting G2-M checkpoint control proteins.

TRAF2 may, therefore, serve as an attractive target for anticancer
therapy and radiosensitization.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human glioblastoma U251, human non–small cell lung
carcinoma H1299, human head and neck cancer UM-SCC-1 cells, and
TRAF2+/+ or TRAF2 / mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (17) were
grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlantic Bioscience).
Normal bronchial epithelial cells, NL20, were grown in Ham’s F12 medium
with 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 2.7 g/L glucose, 2.0 mmol/L L-glutamine,
0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, 5 Ag/mL insulin, 10 ng/mL EGF,
1 Ag/mL transferrin, 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone, and 4% FBS.

ATPlite cell viability assay and radiation exposure. Cells were seeded
in 96-well plates and the following day treated with a range of radiation
doses using a 250 kV orthovoltage unit (Philips). Cell viability was measured
48 h after irradiation using an ATPlite kit (Perkin-Elmer; ref. 18).
siRNA library screen. The siRNA library has been described previously
and targets each gene with a pool of siRNAs consisting of a combination of
four siRNA duplexes directed at different regions (19). For this study, we
used a portion of the library that targets the kinases and E3 ubiquitin ligases
using four siRNAs per target as a pool at each concentration of 12.5 nmol/L.
U251 cells were seeded in duplicate on day 1 at 6,000 per well in 96-well
plates (Dot Scientific). Cells were transfected the next day with each siRNA
pool using EasyTransgater-si (American Pharma Source). As controls,
siRNA to the polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) gene (NM_005030) and a universal
nontargeting siRNA were used in the screening. The cells were transfected
for a total of 4 h, after which the medium was changed. On day 3, one plate
was left unirradiated, whereas the other was subjected to 7.5 Gy of
radiation. The cells were then allowed to grow for an additional
48 h followed by cell viability determination using the ATPlite assay.
A Z factor was calculated (>0.5) to validate the robustness of the assay for
high-throughput screening (20). The average of each treatment was
normalized to the average of the negative control samples to determine
cell viability.
Lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA silencing of TRAF2. The siRNA
oligonucleotide or a lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) construct
was used to silence TRAF2. The sequence of siRNA oligonucleotides is as
follows: siTRAF2-01, 5¶-GGAGCATTGGCCTCAAGGATTCAAGAGATCCTTGAGGCCAATGCTCCTTTTTTGT-3¶; siTRAF2-02 , 5¶-CTAGACAAAAAAGGAGCATTGGCCTCAAGGATCTCTTGAATCCTTGAGGCCAATGCTCC-3¶.
The control siRNA sequences are as follows: siControl-01, 5¶-ATTGTATGCGATCGCAGACTTTTCAAGAGAAAGTCTGCGATCGCATACAATTTTTTGT3¶; siControl-02, 5¶-CTAGACAAAAAATTGTATGCGATCGCAGACTTTCTCTTGAAAAGTCTGCGATCGCATACAAT-3¶. The lentivirus-based vector was
prepared and used to infect U251 or H1299 cells. Cell lysates were prepared
48 to 72 h later for Western blotting analysis (21).
Western blot analysis. The assay was performed as described (18) using
antibodies against TRAF2, Wee1, InBa, Cdc25C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP)-1, cIAP-2, receptor interacting
protein (RIP)-1, cyclin B1, Cdc2 (Cell Signaling), Cdc25B (BD), Chk2
(Upstate), PLK-1, Aurora-A/B, and h-actin (Sigma).
Clonogenic assay. Cells after lentivirus-based shRNA silencing or siRNA
oligonucleotide transfection were seeded in six-well plates at three different
cell densities in duplicate. The next day, cells were exposed to different
doses of radiation followed by incubation at 37jC for 7 to 9 d. The colonies
formed were fixed and the surviving fraction was determined by the
proportion of seeded cells following irradiation to form colonies relative to
untreated cells as described (22).
Construction of RING mutant and establishment of TRAF2 stable
clones. A TRAF2 RING mutant (C49A/H51A/C54A/C57A), previously
shown to have a substantial reduction of ligase activity (23), was made
by the QuikChange Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene)
and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids expressing wild-type (WT)
FLAG-TRAF2, a dominant-negative mutant, FLAG-DN-TRAF2 (24), or a
ligase-dead mutant, FLAG-TRAF2-RING-mutant (23), were transfected
into U251 or H1299 cells, respectively. Stable clones were selected with
G418 and pooled.
Immunohistochemical staining. A lung tissue microarray was
constructed from the most representative area using the methodology
of Nocito and colleagues (25). Immunohistochemical staining was
performed on the DAKO Autostainer (DAKO) using DAKO LSAB+ and
3,3¶-diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. Deparaffinized sections of
formalin-fixed tissue at 5-Am thickness were labeled with rabbit
anti-TRAF2 (1:400; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) after microwave epitope
retrieval in citric acid (pH 6). Appropriate negative (no primary antibody)
and positive controls (spleen) were stained in parallel with each set of
tumors studied.
Luciferase reporter assay. U251 cells were infected with lentivirus
targeting TRAF2, along with the control virus. Forty-eight hours after

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

infection, cells were seeded into 96-well plate and transfected with a
luciferase reporter driven by NF-nB consensus sequence (pNifty plasmid;
Invivogen), along with Renilla construct. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were either treated with TNFa (10 ng/mL; BD biospheres) for
3 h or exposed to 10 Gy X-ray. Cells were harvested 24 h later for luciferase
activity assay (Promega). The results were presented as the fold activation
after normalization with Renilla.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cells were infected with
lentivirus targeting TRAF2, along with the control virus. Forty-eight hours
after infections, cells were seeded into 60-mm dish and exposed 24 h later to
ionizing radiation (10 Gy). Cells were harvested 24 h after radiation and
analyzed by flow cytometry (18).
Statistical analysis. The paired Student’s t test was used for statistical
analysis of luciferase reporter assay and clonogenic assay using Statistical
Analysis System software.

Results
Identification of TRAF2 as a target for radiosensitization
and cell survival in U251 cells. To identify novel radiosensitizing
target(s), we screened a siRNA library directed against the kinases
and E3 ubiquitin ligases (19) using the well-characterized radioresistant U251 glioblastoma cells (2). U251 cell proliferation, as
measured by an ATPlite assay in a 96-well plate, is inhibited by only
30% in response to a high dose of ionizing radiation (10 Gy) as
shown in Fig. 1A (top). Based on these observations, a dose of
7.5 Gy, which caused a 25% growth inhibition, was chosen for the
siRNA screen as outlined in Fig. 1A (bottom). Hits were defined as
those that sensitized cells to radiation by z10% compared with
the control siRNA. These hits were then confirmed in duplicate
with or without radiation followed by siRNA silencing confirmation
by Western blotting analysis. The confirmed hits were subjected to
further validation using classic clonogenic assays on siRNA
silencing. Results from our siRNA library screen yielded four hits
that reproducibly sensitized cells to radiation and include TRAF2,
FLT1, LIMK1, and TRIM5. Among these hits, we decided to validate
TRAF2 as a novel radiosensitizing target because literature
evidence supports its function in the TNFR signaling pathway,
NF-nB activation, and cell survival (14). To validate TRAF2, four
individual siRNA oligonucleotides, each targeting different regions
of the TRAF2 gene, were made and tested for radiosensitization.
Multiple TRAF2 siRNAs moderately sensitized U251 cells to
radiation treatment, with one siRNA oligonucleotide (TRAF2-1)
being the most active (data not shown). To confirm that TRAF2
siRNA-induced radiosensitization correlated with TRAF2 knockdown, we continued our validation by cloning the best TRAF2-1
siRNA into a lentivirus-based shRNA system. As shown in Fig. 1B
(top), infection of the scrambled control siRNA did not cause any
change in TRAF2 levels, whereas infection of TRAF2-1 siRNA
caused a significant reduction in TRAF2 levels compared with
parental cells. Using the ATPlite short-term assay, siRNA knockdown of TRAF2 induced a 2.5-fold reduction of cell growth rate
(Fig. 1B, middle). In addition, TRAF2 knockdown in combination of
different dose of ionizing radiation conferred radiosensitivity at all
doses tested (Fig. 1B, bottom). Furthermore, in a standard
clonogenic assay, the plating efficiency of U251 in the absence of
radiation decreased f6-fold in siTRAF2-infected cells compared
with the control (Fig. 1C, top). A dose-dependent radiosensitization
on TRAF2 silencing was also observed (Fig. 1C, middle) with
a sensitizing enhancement ratio (SER) of 1.2. This moderate
radiosensitizing effect, although statistically significant (P < 0.05),
might be underestimated due to a high degree of cytotoxicity
induced by lentivirus-based constitutive TRAF2 silencing (Fig. 1C,

TRAF2 as an Anticancer and Radiosensitizing Target

Figure 2. TRAF2 silencing sensitized lung
cancer cells as well as head and neck cancer
cells to radiation. A, TRAF2 silencing caused
growth inhibition and radiosensitization in
H1299 cells. H1299 cells were infected with
lenti-si-Cont or lenti-si-TRAF2. Cell lysates
were prepared for Western blot analysis (top )
or to standard clonogenic assay in the absence
(panel 2) or presence (panel 3) of radiation.
Bottom, H1299 cells were also transiently
transfected with siRNA oligonucleotide
targeting TRAF2 and exposed to radiation
48 h after transfection when TRAF2 was
silenced and subjected to standard clonogenic
assay. Three independent experiments were
conducted. Points, mean; bars, SE. SER was
calculated as above. B, transient TRAF2
silencing caused radiosensitization in
UM-SCC-1 cells. Cells were transiently
transfected with siRNA oligonucleotide
targeting TRAF2. Cells were harvested
48 h after transfection. One portion was
subjected to Western blot analysis (top ) and
the other portion was subjected to clonogenic
assay after exposure to indicated dose of
radiation. Shown are plating efficiency (middle )
and surviving fraction (bottom ) from three
independent experiments. Bars, SE. SER was

top). We, therefore, transfected TRAF2 siRNA oligonucleotide to
transiently silence TRAF2 at the time of radiation. As shown in
Fig. 1C (bottom), transient TRAF2 knockdown gave rise to a greater
radiosensitization, with SER value increasing from 1.2 to 1.39
(again, P < 0.05) Thus, TRAF2 silencing not only remarkably
inhibited cancer cell growth and survival but also sensitized cells,
to a lesser extent, to radiation in both the monolayer growth assay
and the standard clonogenic assay.
TRAF2 siRNA silencing inhibits cell growth and moderately
sensitizes H1299 and UM-SCC-1 cells to radiation. We next
extended our TRAF2 silencing study to another radioresistant
H1299 lung cancer line. H1299 cells were found to be the most
radioresistant lung cancer line among four lines tested, including
A549, H460, and SKLU-1, with a 25% growth inhibition at dose of
7.5 Gy, similar to U251 (data not shown). H1299 infection of
lenti-si-TRAF2 induced up to 80% protein knockdown (Fig. 2A, top),
which correlated with a significant 3-fold reduction in plating
efficiency using a clonogenic assay (Fig. 2A, panel 2). Furthermore,
reduction of TRAF2 sensitized H1299 cells to radiation, particularly
at higher doses with a SER of 1.2 (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A, panel 3). To
avoid overt toxicity associated with constitutive TRAF2 silencing,
we also transiently silenced TRAF2 using a siRNA oligonucleotide.
As shown in Fig. 2A (bottom), transient TRAF2 silencing indeed
increased radiation sensitivity with SER value increasing from
1.2 to 1.29 (P < 0.01).

www.aacrjournals.org

Finally, we determined radiosensitizing effect of TRAF2 silencing
in UM-SCC-1, a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma line. As
shown in Fig. 2B (top), transient transfection of si-TRAF2
oligonucleotide caused f70% TRAF2 knockdown at 48 h after
transfection when radiation was delivered. This transient TRAF2
knockdown had no effect on cell survival as reflected by plating
efficiency (middle) but did sensitize cells to radiation with a SER
value of 1.45 (P < 0.05). Thus, the results from three human cancer
cell lines indicate that TRAF2 knockdown, particularly at the time
of radiation in a transient basis, could sensitize cancer cells to
radiation.
Radioprotection by WT TRAF2 and radiosensitization by a
dominant-negative TRAF2 mutant in U251 cells. We next
determined whether overexpression of TRAF2 would protect U251
cells from radiation-induced killing, whereas overexpression of
dominant-negative TRAF2 would induce radiosensitization. To
avoid clonal heterogenicity, we used a pool of G418 stable clones
from individual transfection, along with the empty vector neo
control, and confirmed the exogenous expression of TRAF2 and its
mutant by anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3A, top). A standard clonogenic
assay showed that, compared with the vector neo control,
overexpression of TRAF2 rendered cells radioresistant by significantly increasing the number of radiation-resistant colonies with
a protective factor (PF) of 1.24 (P < 0.01; Fig. 3A, bottom). In
contrast, overexpression of a dominant-negative TRAF2 mutant

Figure 3. Radioprotection and
radiosensitization by TRAF2 or its RING
mutants in U251 (A) and H1299 (B) cells.
U251 cells were transfected with
FLAG-TRAF2 or FLAG-TRAF2DN
(a dominant-negative mutant), whereas
H1299 cells were transfected with
FLAG-TRAF2 or TRAF2 RING mutant
(H1299-RM, a ligase-dead mutant),
respectively, along with the empty vector
neo control. Top, the G418-resistant stable
clones were pooled after 2 wk of selection,
and expression of exogenous TRAF2 was
determined by Western blotting using
anti-FLAG antibody (A ) or anti-TRAF2
antibody (B); bottom, pooled stable clones
were then subjected to standard clonogenic
assay. Points, mean from three

induced a significant reduction of growth rate (data not shown)
and moderately enhanced sensitivity to radiation with a SER of 1.16
(P < 0.05; Fig. 3A, bottom). Thus, overexpression of TRAF2 protects
cells from radiation, whereas knockdown of TRAF2 by siRNA or
inhibition of TRAF2 by a dominant-negative mutant suppresses cell
growth and sensitizes cells to radiation.
TRAF2 radioprotection is RING domain ligase dependent in
H1299 cells. We further determined TRAF2 radioprotection and if
this protection is ligase activity dependent in H1299 cells using a

TRAF2 RING mutant (C49A/H51A/C54A/C57A) with minimal
ligase activity (23). On overexpression (Fig. 3B, top), WT TRAF2
conferred radiation protection with a PF of 1.2, whereas the RING
mutant abrogated this protection (Fig. 3B, bottom). Statistical
analysis revealed that the protection by WT TRAF2 is significant
(P < 0.05). Taken together, the results from U251 (RING deletion)
and H1299 (RING mutation) indicate that the RING domain
structure and ligase activity is required for TRAF2-mediated
protection against radiation.

evaluation 48 h later using ATPlite assay. D, columns, mean from three independent experiments; bars, SE.

TRAF2 overexpression in lung cancer tissues and cell lines.
Oncomine database4 search for potential TRAF2 overexpression in
tumor cells revealed that TRAF2 mRNA is dramatically overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma compared with normal tissues
(26). The data were retrieved and summarized in Fig. 4A (left). To
further confirm TRAF2 overexpression in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues, we performed immunohistochemical analysis using
a human TRAF2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A (right), whereas
normal lung tissues showed no TRAF2 staining, lung tumor tissues
showed significant staining of TRAF2 in the cytoplasm of cancer
cells. These data show that TRAF2 is not expressed in normal lung
tissue but overexpressed in lung cancer. We further determined
whether TRAF2 is also overexpressed in lung cancer cell lines
compared with immortalized bronchial epithelial cells (NL20). As
shown in Fig. 4B, TRAF2 is detectable but low in NL20 cells. TRAF2
was found to be overexpressed in the majority of lung cancer cell
lines tested.
TRAF2 silencing has a minimal effect on normal bronchial
epithelial NL20 cells. Silencing of TRAF2 siRNA inhibited growth
or survival of cancer cells and sensitized cancer cells to radiation,
suggesting that TRAF2 is a promising cancer and radiosensitizing
target. To gain the therapeutic index, however, inhibition of a
potential cancer target should have a minimal effect on normal
cells. To this end, we tested the effects of TRAF2 silencing on the
growth and radiosensitization of normal bronchial epithelial NL20
cells. Compared with the control siRNA, TRAF2 siRNA-mediated
knockdown (Fig. 4C) has no effect on normal cell growth nor effect
on cellular sensitivity to radiation up to 5 Gy (Fig. 4D). We were
unable to assess the effect on radiosensitization using the
clonogenic assay because NL20 cells are nontransformed cells
and cannot form colonies.
TRAF2 siRNA enhances radiation-induced G2-M arrest and
apoptosis. To elucidate the nature of growth suppression and
radiosensitization by TRAF2 silencing, we performed fluorescenceactivated cell sorting profiling analysis to reveal TRAF2 silencing-

or radiation-induced cell cycle redistribution as well as apoptosis
as evidenced by appearance of a sub-G1 population. As shown
in Table 1, for untreated U251 cells, the majority of cells were in
the G1 phase of the cell cycle, regardless of TRAF2 silencing.
Radiation treatment of the control U251 cells induced apoptosis as
well as a G2-M arrest. This was more pronounced after TRAF2
silencing, which resulted in a further increase of the apoptotic
population ( from 11.5% to 18.9%) and corresponding G2-M arrest
( from 45.9% to 59.4%). In H1299 cells, radiation caused a moderate
induction of apoptosis, independent of TRAF2 silencing, but a
significant induction of the G2-M arrest. This radiation-induced
G2-M arrest was much more pronounced in TRAF2-silenced cells
( from 11.5% to 19.2%).
We further confirmed the regulation of TRAF2 on radiationinduced G2-M arrest using MEF cells derived from WT and TRAF2
knockout mice. Indeed, TRAF2 deletion increased the levels of
radiation-induced apoptosis ( from 2.5% to 9.5%) and G2-M arrest
( from 29.4% to 39.6%; Table 1). Because cells in the different phases
of the cell cycle have a different sensitivity to radiation, we
synchronized MEFs in the G1 phase by serum starvation (SS) for
72 h (leading to 80% cell population in G1 in both cell types; data
not shown) before radiation. Serum-starved MEF cells were
resistant to radiation-induced apoptosis but sensitive to G2-M
arrest, which was increased remarkably in TRAF2-null cells
(39.4% versus 18.3% in control; Table 1). Thus, TRAF2 silencing
or knockout enhances radiation-induced G2-M arrest.
TRAF2 silencing reduces RIP-1 levels and blocks radiationinduced IKBA degradation and NF-KB activation. TRAF2 is
an adaptor protein that binds to antiapoptotic proteins cIAP-1,
cIAP-2, and RIP-1 to mediate TNFa/TNFR signal pathway, leading
to NF-nB activation and cell survival (14, 16, 27), whereas ionizing
radiation activates NF-nB (28) through degradation of InB (29, 30).
To elucidate the mechanism by which TRAF2 silencing induces
growth suppression and radiosensitization, we determined the
levels of cIAPs, RIP-1, as well as InBa on TRAF2 silencing alone
or in combination with radiation. As shown in Fig. 5A, TRAF2
levels in both H1299 and U251 cells were completely silenced on
lenti-si-TRAF2 infection (lanes 4–6 and 10–12). Neither TRAF2
silencing nor radiation had any effects on the levels of cIAP-1 and

cIAP-2. However, TRAF2 silencing significantly reduced the
levels of RIP-1, particularly in H1299 cells, regardless of radiation
(lanes 4–6 and 10–12). Furthermore, although TRAF2 silencing
did not change the basal levels of InBa (lane 4 versus lane 1
and lane 10 versus lane 7), it did prevent radiation-induced
degradation of InBa, particularly in U251 cells (lanes 2 and 3
versus lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 8 and 9 versus lanes 11 and 12).
We further determined whether the failure to induce InB
degradation, on TRAF2 silencing, would be translated to the
loss of NF-nB activation by a luciferase-based transactivation
assay. As shown in Fig. 5B, in siControl-infected U251 cells, TNFa
(serving as positive control for the assay) induced a 4-fold
activation of NF-nB. Radiation exposure also induced up to 2-fold
activation of NF-nB, which is statistically significant (P < 0.01). In
contrast, NF-nB in TRAF2-silenced U251 cells was not activated
by either TNFa or radiation. The results indicate that TRAF2
silencing blocks the activation of NF-nB signaling pathway, which
could contribute, at least in part, to observed growth suppression
and radiosensitization.
TRAF2 siRNA silencing reduces the levels of several G2-M
checkpoint regulatory proteins. Because TRAF2 silencing
enhances radiation-induced G2-M arrest, we determined potential
changes of proteins known to regulate G2-M progression. As shown
in Fig. 5C, in both H1299 and U251 cells, TRAF2 siRNA silencing
reduced the levels of Wee1, cyclin B1, and Aurora-B (70–90%) and
moderately reduced (20–50%) the levels of Cdc2, PLK-1, and
Aurora-A. In H1299 cells, TRAF2 silencing also reduced the levels of
Cdc25C but had little or no effect on the levels of Cdc25B and Chk2.
We were unable to detect the expression of Cdc25C and Chk2 in
U251 cells (Fig. 5C) and Chk1, 14-3-3j, and phosphorylated form of
Chk1 and Chk2 in both lines (data not shown). Among these G2-M
checkpoint proteins, radiation seemed to induce cyclin B1, PLK-1,

and Aurora-B and the induction was largely independent of TRAF2
silencing. Thus, TRAF2 silencing caused the repression of several
G2-M checkpoint proteins, which likely contributes to the observed
growth inhibition, enhanced G2-M arrest on radiation, and
radiosensitization.

Discussion
Through the siRNA-based screening, we identified the ubiquitin
ligase TRAF2 as a candidate radiosensitizing target. Further
characterization revealed that TRAF2 silencing remarkably
inhibited tumor cell growth and survival and moderately sensitized
cancer cells, including glioblastoma U251, lung cancer H1299, and
head and neck squamous carcinoma UM-SCC-1, to radiation. Our
observations that TRAF2 confers resistance to radiation, plays a
role in cell survival, and is an E3 ubiquitin ligase with druggable
feature suggest that TRAF2 is an attractive target for anticancer
therapy and radiosensitization.
TRAF2 seems to meet several criteria for an ideal anticancer
target (31, 32). TRAF2 is a cellular survival protein that protects
cells from apoptosis (see refs. 14–16 for review). Likewise, we have
shown here that siRNA silencing of TRAF2 suppressed the growth
and survival of U251 and H1299 cells. Similarly, transfection of
U251 cells with a RING-less TRAF2 dominant-negative mutant (33)
significantly inhibited cell growth (data not shown). In addition,
whereas TRAF2 overexpression dramatically protected cancer cells
from radiation-induced killing, TRAF2 inhibition by siRNA or
dominant-negative mutant sensitized cancer cells to radiation in
three independent human cancer cell lines, indicating that this
effect is a general phenomenon. A greater radiosensitizing effect,
with SER value increasing from 1.2 up to 1.4, was observed when
TRAF2 was transiently silenced at the time of radiation to avoid

Figure 5. TRAF2 silencing reduced RIP-1
levels (A ), blocked radiation-induced NF-nB
activation (B), and altered expression of
several G2-M checkpoint proteins (C ).

TRAF2 as an Anticancer and Radiosensitizing Target

the high levels of cytotoxicity resulting from lenti-si-TRAF2–
mediated constitutive silencing. Thus, TRAF2 silencing remarkably
inhibits the growth and survival of cancer cells and to a lesser
extent enhances radiation-induced cancer cell killing.
Importantly, we found that compared with normal lung tissues
and nontransformed bronchial epithelial cells, the levels of TRAF2
were significantly higher in lung adenocarcinoma and in most
lung cancer cell lines (Fig. 4). Few previous microarray profiling
studies also showed that TRAF2 mRNA was overexpressed in
lung cancer tissues (26, 34). Furthermore, TRAF2 overexpression
was reported in pancreatic cancer, which protected cancer
cells from apoptosis and promoted invasiveness (35, 36).
Increased TRAF2 levels were also found in hepatocellular
carcinoma, compared with nontumorous liver (37), in metastatic
prostate cancer, compared with localized prostate carcinoma
(38), or during melanoma progression (39). Thus, it seems
that TRAF2 may be involved in carcinogenesis and/or tumor
metastasis.
The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF2 seems critical for its
apoptosis-protecting function because RING-deleted TRAF2
mutant acts in a dominant-negative manner to block WT
TRAF2 function (24, 39), consistent with our observation that
TRAF2 dominant-negative mutant suppressed cancer cell growth
and sensitized cancer cells to radiation. Importantly, WT TRAF2
protected cancer cells from radiation, whereas a RING mutant
with minimal ligase activity lost such an activity. Thus, the
inhibitors against TRAF2 E3 ligase could be identified and
developed as a novel class of anticancer agent and radiosensitizer
(31, 32, 40).
Mechanistically, prosurvival protein TRAF2 was found to bind to
antiapoptotic protein cIAP-1 or cIAP-2 to block caspase-8 activation
(41) or bind to TRADD and RIP, leading to InB kinase (IKK)
activation, followed by NF-nB activation (see refs. 13, 14, 16 for
review). We found that TRAF2 silencing had no effect on the
levels of cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 but did reduce the levels of RIP-1.
Although it is not clear at the present time how TRAF2 silencing
down-regulates RIP-1, the lower level of RIP-1 is likely to reduce
IKK activation, followed by the lack of InBa degradation and of
NF-nB activation. This seems to be the case because in TRAF2silenced U251 cells, radiation-induced InBa degradation was
abolished and NF-nB was no longer activated by either radiation
or TNFa. Because NF-nB is a predominant survival transcription
factor (42), the lack of NF-nB activation would likely contribute to
less cellular viability and more radiosensitization, which is noted in
TRAF2-silenced cells. Consistently, previous studies using MEF or
thymocytes from TRAF2-null or TRAF2 dominant-negative mice also
showed an increased sensitivity to TNF-a–induced apoptosis (17,
43). Moreover, expression of dominant-negative TRAF2 sensitized
metastatic melanoma cells to UV-induced apoptosis via suppression
of NF-nB activity (39).

On DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation, mammalian
cells are arrested at the G2-M phase of cell cycle by checkpoint
control proteins that allow time for damaged DNA to be repaired
before cells enter the next cycle (see refs. 44, 45 for review).
G2-M progression is positively regulated by Cdc2/cyclin B1 and
Cdc25B/Cdc25C and negatively regulated by Wee1, Chk1, and
Chk2 kinases, whereas mitotic spindle checkpoints are controlled
by PLK-1, Aurora-A, and Aurora-B kinases (44–47). In this study,
we made several novel observations that (a) TRAF2 silencing
has a profound inhibitory effect on the levels of both positive
and negative regulators of G2-M checkpoint proteins; (b) radiation
induces expression of mitotic spindle checkpoint proteins,
particularly Aurora-B (Fig. 5C); and (c) TRAF2 silencing enhances
radiation-induced G2-M arrest and cell killing (Table 1). It has
been recently shown that targeting Aurora-B kinase via small
molecular inhibitor, siRNA, or dominant-negative mutants
sensitizes human cancer cells, particularly those with p53
deficiency, to radiation (48). Thus, radiation-induced Aurora-B
expression could be a cellular protective response to ensure a
mitotic arrest on radiation, whereas the elimination of Aurora-B
via TRAF2 silencing would likely contribute to radiosensitization
of p53-null (H1299) and p53-mutant (U251) cancer cells. On the
other hand, the lack of obvious changes in cell cycle distribution
on TRAF2 silencing may reflect a neutralizing consequence of
simultaneous down-regulation of both positive and negative G2-M
checkpoint regulators. Moreover, the profound inhibition of
G2-M regulatory proteins on TRAF2 silencing would make it
difficult to rescue the phenotypes of growth inhibition and
radiosensitization by overexpression of one or two such proteins.
Given the fact that many of these checkpoint proteins are
well-characterized cancer targets and many of their inhibitors are
currently being developed at the different phases of clinical trials
(46, 47), the finding that TRAF2 silencing inhibits the expression
of multiple checkpoint proteins makes TRAF2 a more appealing
anticancer target.
