Abstract:
Acute interstitial pneumonia is one of serious side effects of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, while it often has
significant clinical benefit in cancer patients. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify
underlying mechanisms for the development of the adverse effects by EGFR-TKI. In
the present study, we attempted to determine how EGFR-TKI treatment in cancer
cells induced interstitial pneumonia. The growth of tongue cancer HSC-3 and lung
cancer A549 cell lines treated with EGFR-TKI was assessed by MTT assay. Cytokines
and growth factors in conditioned medium obtained from EGFR-TKI-treated cancer
cells were analyzed using cytokine membrane array and ELISA. Interleukin-6 (IL6) promoter activity was measured by luciferase assay. We found that EGFR-TKI
treatment significantly decreased the cell viability yet increased expression levels of
IL-6 protein and mRNA, IL-6 secretion, and IL-6 transcriptional activity in these lines.
In addition, using the co-culture model and IL-6 treatment was found to increase the
expression of collagen and α-actin, which were markers for fibrosis, in lung fibroblast
cells. These results suggest that up-regulated IL-6 plays an important role in the
development of EGFR-TKI-induced interstitial fibroblastic proliferation. Therefore,
blocking of IL-6 signaling could be beneficial to cancer patients undergoing EGFR-TKI
treatment for reducing the risk of its unfavorable effects.

Introduction

therefore inhibit the growth of cancer cells dramatically.
On the other hand, the effect of EGFR-TKI is dependent
on mutations of EGFR and KRAS, MET amplification, and
the interaction between EGFR and HER-2 and so on [26]. More importantly, EGFR-TKI treatment gives rise to
severe side effects, including acute interstitial pneumonia
[7]. Although some studies have suggested risk factors for
side effects [8-12], detailed molecular mechanism for their
development remains unknown.
Recently, Kim et al. indicated that EGFR-TKI
activated STAT3 in non-small cell lung cancer cells [13].
They also showed that STAT3 activation was caused by
interleukin-6 (IL-6) in an autocrine manner. IL-6 is one

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a well-known
growth factor that promotes cancer progression. EGF
stimulates cancer growth through the EGFR receptor
(EGFR) pathway. Most of cancer tissues are shown
to overexpress EGFR, and EGF-EGFR axis has been
considered a attractive target for cancer treatment.
Indeed, EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs)
have been developed and clinically used in patients with
malignancy, especially non-small cell lung carcinoma
[1,2]. EGFR-TKI effectively blocks the EGFR pathway
via suppression of EGFR phosphorylation and can

of inflammatory cytokines and is well known as a cancer
progression-related cytokine [14,15]. Because STAT3 is
one of the targets for anti-cancer drug resistance [16],
most of investigations have been only focused on how
IL-6 regulates the drug resistance in EGFR-TKI-treated
cancer cells.
In the current study, we explored therapeutic effects
of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition, using two EGFRTKIs and an αEGFR antibody, in human tongue and lung
cancer cell lines. Further, we found that EGFR blocking
could increase IL-6 in the cancer cells. Because IL-6
has been suggested to contribute to the development or
progression of acute interstitial pneumonia [17-20], we
anticipated the possible linkage between IL-6 from cancer
cells and EGFR-TKI-induced acute interstitial pneumonia.
Our results suggested that IL-6 secreted from EGFR-TKItreated cancer cells induced lung fibrosis. Accordingly, a
combination of IL-6 pathway blocker and EGFR-TKI may
show more favorable effects in cancer patients.

the growth of HSC-3 cells dramatically in dose- and timedependent manners, as compared with mock-treated cells
(Figure 1A). The growth of A549 cells was similarly
inhibited by AG1478 (Figure 1B).
To confirm the inhibition of EGF pathway by
EGFR-TKI treatment, HSC-3 and A549 cells were
treated with EGF after the pre-treatment of AG1478
and αEGFR antibody. EGF treatment stimulated EGFR
phosphorylation at 10 min (Figure 2). EGF treatment also
increased phosphorylation of STAT3 and MAPK in HSC-3
cells as well as Akt phosphorylation in A549 cells. When
cells were pre-treated with AG1478 or αEGFR antibody,
EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited especially in HSC3. AG1478 also inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3, Akt,
and MAPK. These results suggest that EGFR-TKI and
αEGFR antibody decrease cell growth via inhibiting EGF
phosphorylation.

Results

Western blotting was then performed in HSC-3 cells
treated with AG1478 for up to 24 hrs. As shown in Figure
3A, EGF induced EGFR and STAT3 phosphorylation
from 10 min to 6 hrs. Further, AG1478 pre-treatment
effectively prevented their phosphorylation induced
by EGF stimulation. On the other hand, AG1478 pretreatment increased STAT3 phosphorylation at 24 hrs
while EGF treatment did not induce the phosphorylation
of EGFR and STAT3 at 24 hrs. We also confirmed STAT3

EGFR-TKI inhibits the growth of cancer cell
lines.
We first investigated the growth inhibition effect of
EGFR-TKI treatment in human tongue and lung cancer
cells, using MTT assay. AG1478 treatment could decrease

phosphorylation at 24 hrs using another EGFR-TKI,
ZD1839 (Figure 3B).
Growth factors or cytokines are well known
to increase STAT3 phosphorylation [21]. Therefore,
we anticipated that growth factors or cytokines could
be induced by EGFR-TKI treatment. Using cytokine
membrane arrays, we screened factors that were up- or
down-regulated in Conditioned Medium (CM) obtained
from EGFR-TKI- or αEGFR antibody-treated cancer
cells. Of the factors, IL-6 was found to be augmented
significantly in CM with EGFR-TKI and αEGFR
antibody, compared with control CM. (Figure 4A and
B). In addition, we examined IL-6 protein secretion by
ELISA and mRNA expression by qPCR in HSC-3 cells.
All of EGFR blocking reagents increased IL-6 secretion
(Figure 4C). Similarly, these EGFR blocking reagents
also increased IL-6 mRNA in HSC-3 cells, compared with
that in control- or DMSO-treated cells (Figure 4D). These
results suggested increases in IL-6 mRNA levels were
regulated at a transcriptional level. Then, we tested the
effects of EGFR blocking on IL-6 promoter transcriptional
activity in HSC-3 cells, using luciferase reporter gene
assay. Because the IL-6 promoter contains AP-1 binding
site, AP-1 transcription was also assessed. As expected,
ZD1839 treatment induced transcriptional activity

of IL-6 and AP-1 (Figure 4E). Thus, EGFR blocking
reagents appeared to activate IL-6 promoter transcription
presumably via the regulation of AP-1 activation.

IL-6 increases COL1A1 expression in lung
fibroblasts.
Because IL-6 has been linked to the development
of acute interstitial pneumonia [15-18], we expected that
EGFR-TKI treatment-induced IL-6 production in cancer
cells resulted in lung fibrosis. To confirm this hypothesis,
we assessed the expression of fibrosis markers in normal
lung cells, COL1A1 and α-actin, in lung fibroblastic cells.
CM obtained from HSC-3 cells treated with EGFR-TKI or
αEGFR antibody was added to OUS-11 cell culture. The
levels of COL1A1 mRNA in OUS-11 cells were higher
when treated with AG1478 or αEGFR antibody (Figure
5A). We also assessed COL1A1 and α-actin protein
expression using the co-culture models (HSC-3/OUS11, HSC-3/HEF1) followed by western blot. In both cell
lines AG1478 or αEGFR antibody increased the levels of
COL1A1 and α-actin proteins (Figure 5B). To confirm
that IL-6 itself up-regulates COL1A1 and α-actin, we
examined whether recombinant IL-6 increased COL1A1

Figure 2: EGFR-TKI inhibits phosphorylation of molecules related to downstream signaling of EGFR. HSC-3 and A549
cells treated with EGF and other drugs as indicated were analyzed on western blotting, using antibodies to the downstream signaling of
EGFR, including pEGFR (175 kDa), EGFR (175 kDa), pSTAT3 (86 kDa), STAT3 (86 kDa), pAKT (60 kDa), AKT (60 kDa), pMAPK (42
and 44 kDa), and MAPK (42 and 44 kDa). β-Actin (43 kDa) served as an internal control.

expression. When OUS-11 and HFL1 cells were treated
with IL-6, the expression of COL1A1 protein (Figure
5C) and COL1A1 mRNA (Figure 5D) was significantly
enhanced. In addition, αIL-6 antibody pre-treatment
antagonized COL1A1 mRNA expression in IL-6-treated
OUS-11 cells (Figure 5D). Other Collagen 1A subtypes
(COL1A2 and COL1A3) were also up-regulated by
IL-6 treatment, which was inhibited by αIL-6 antibody.
These results suggest that IL-6 may play a key role in the
development of EGFR-TKI-induced lung fibrosis.

EGFR-TKI treatment in cancer cells increased IL-6
secretion, even if EGFR phosphorylation was completely
blocked by EGFR-TKI. Furthermore, EGFR blocking,
using an αEGFR antibody that neutralizes EGFR by
competition with EGF on the external domain of EGFR,
also resulted in increases in IL-6 production from cancer
cells. Therefore, IL-6 production by EGFR blocking might
be rather the general reaction by EGFR blocking than
EGFR-TKI-specific reaction.
Consistent with previous findings [13], we showed
the enhancement of IL-6 mRNA in EFGR-TKI-treated
cancer cells. Thus, IL-6 expression might be controlled
at a transcriptional level. Moreover, we showed EGFRTKI treatment activated IL-6 promoter in HSC-3 cells.
For IL-6 mRNA transcription, some transcriptional
factors, such as NFκB or AP-1, are needed to be activated
[22]. Takada et al. showed Fra-1 was involved in lung
interstitial disease associated with EGFR-TKI treatment
in lung cells [23]. Indeed, AP-1 was activated by EGFRTKI in our reporter assays. Thus, AP-1 activation might be
one of the mechanisms for IL-6 overexpression in cancer
cells. Other possibilities include activated STAT3 induced
IL-6 transcription through IL-6-STAT3 axis as a positive
feedback loop [24]. Yao et al. indicated that TGFβ could
increase IL-6 at a transcriptional level independent of
EGFR activation [25], which may explain a mechanism
for up-regulation of IL-6 promoter transcriptional activity
by EGFR-TKI. Further investigations are needed to clarify
how EGFR-TKI regulates IL-6 production in cancer cells.

Discussion
It has been shown that EGF promotes cancer
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Therefore,
EGFR is one of the molecular targets for the treatment
of malignancies, such as non-small cell lung cancer.
In this study, we confirmed that EGFR-TKI had antitumor effects in not only lung adenocarcinoma but also
tongue squamous cell carcinoma. Interestingly, growth
suppression was more significant in HSC-3 tongue cancer
cells than in A549 lung cancer cells. Thus, EGFR-TKI
might also be effective in patients with tongue cancer.
EGFR-TKI has been clinically used in cancer
patients although it is occasionally associated with severe
side effects, including acute interstitial pneumonia.
Therefore, to use EGFR-TKI more safely, it is necessary
to clarify the mechanism of acute interstitial pneumonia
development induced by EGFR-TKI. We found that

From our findings, IL-6 from cancer cells could
induce COL1A1 and α-actin expression in lung fibroblast
cells, suggesting IL-6 was likely one of the important
factors for lung fibrosis. Because IL-6 strongly induces
the growth and invasion of cancer cells [14,15], previous
studies were focused on the relationship between IL-6
and anti-cancer treatment. On the other hand, IL-6 is
also known to induce interstitial pneumonia [17-20].
Therefore, we focused on studying the role of IL-6 in
the development of acute interstitial pneumonia induced
by EGFR-TKI treatment. Other molecules, such as
HSP70 [26] and TGFβ [27], have also been considered
to involve interstitial pneumonia. Interestingly, these
molecules are related to IL-6 expression [25,28,29]. Our
results showed that αIL-6 antibody blocked COL1A1
expression. Thus, IL-6 from cancer cells may play a
central role in EGFR-TKI-induced interstitial pneumonia.
Taken together, we propose the following mechanism for
the development of interstitial pneumonia as an adverse
effect of EGFR-TKI treatment (Figure 6). EGFR-TKI

reduces EGFR phosphorylation, which results in decreases
in phosphorylation of some other molecules under the
EGFR pathway. Consequently, the growth of cancer cells
is suppressed. On the other hand, EGFR-TKI activates
AP-1 in cancer cells and produces a large amount of
IL-6 while growth inhibition is observed. Increased IL-6
affects both cancer and lung fibroblast cells. In cancer
cells, IL-6 induces chemoresistance through IL-6-STAT3
axis. In non-neoplastic cells, IL-6 induces fibrosis. Thus,
IL-6 production from EGFR-TKI-treated cancer cells
increases the risk of chemoresistance and acute interstitial
pneumonia.
We demonstrate in vitro evidence suggesting that
IL-6 from cancer cells induces acute interstitial pneumonia
as one of mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of
a side effect of EGFR-TKI treatment. Furthermore, our
findings suggest that the inhibition of IL-6-STAT3 axis
in patients treated with EGFR-TKI could be not only a
therapeutic target for their cancers but also an option to
prevent the development of acute interstitial pneumonia

inhibitor might be more effective and safer treatment in
