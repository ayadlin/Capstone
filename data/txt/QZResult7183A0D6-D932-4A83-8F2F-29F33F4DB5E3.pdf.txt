Abstract:

The membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase-regulator RECK is often downregulated in various types of cancers; the levels of residual RECK in resected tumors
often correlate with better prognosis. Forced expression of RECK in cancer cells
suppresses tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis in xenograft models.
RECK is therefore a promising marker for benignancy and a potential effector in
cancer therapy. We established a cell line containing two transgene systems: (1)
the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene fused to Reck promoter and (2)
the HRAS12V oncogene driven by the Tet-off promoter system. This cell line exhibits
transformed phenotype in regular medium and flat morphology with increased SEAP
activity in the presence of doxycycline, allowing the assessment of RECK-inducing
activity of chemicals in the contexts of both transformed and untransformed cells.
Our pilot experiments with 880 known bioactive compounds detected 34 compounds
that activate RECK promoter; among these, 10 were authentic anticancer drugs.
Four selected compounds up-regulated endogenous RECK protein in several human
cancer cell lines. The top-ranking compound, disulfiram, strongly suppressed
spontaneous lung-metastasis of human fibrosarcoma cells in nude mice. Our data
demonstrate the value of this screen in discovering effective cancer therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

[2]. Classical anticancer drugs were screened based on
their activities to induce shrinkage of tumor xenografts
in experimental animals. These include several categories
of cytotoxic drugs such as DNA-damaging agents (e.g.,
bleomycin), anti-metabolites (e.g., methotrexate), DNA-

Despite the long-standing efforts, the number of
effective cancer therapeutics is far from sufficient [1],
and the problems of drug-resistance arise in many cases

modifying agents (e.g., doxorubicin), DNA topoisomerase
inhibitors (e.g., camptothecin), and microtubules
inhibitors (e.g., paclitaxel). Since these agents target
essential functions of the cells, their effective doses are
narrow-window, and serious side-effects are unavoidable
in many cases [1].
More recent approaches based on knowledge on the
molecular bases of carcinogenesis led to the development
of a series of agents selectively targeting oncoproteins.
Herceptin (trastuzumab), Gleevec (imatinib), and Avastin
(bevacizumab) are among the successful examples of such
molecular-targeted therapeutics [3]. By definition, these
drugs are effective on tumors bearing specific genetic
alterations; tumors initially sensitive to a drug may recur if
second mutations convert the target oncoprotein resistant
to the drug or if some other host mechanisms develop to
make the cells less dependent on that particular pathway
for their survival and/or proliferation [1].
Since invasion and metastasis are among the most
problematic attributes of malignant tumors [4], inhibitors
of these activities have also been sought. The matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) family is interesting in this
regard, since some members of this large protease family
(consisting of more than 20 members) play important
roles in tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis [5].
Although initial clinical trials with some broad-spectrum
MMP inhibitors were discouraging, more selective MMP
inhibitors need to be developed and evaluated under
optimized conditions [6].
RECK was initially identified as a transformation
suppressor gene inducing flat reversion in a v-K-rastransformed mouse fibroblast cell line [7, 8]. RECK
encodes a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored
glycoprotein of ~125 kDa, which inhibits at least four
cancer-associated MMPs, i.e., MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9,
and MT1-MMP [7, 9-11]. Although RECK is expressed
ubiquitously in normal human organs, it is down-regulated
in cancers of many organs including those of the lung (nonsmall cell type), colorectum, breast, and pancreas [12], in
which the prevalent mechanism is probably epigenetic
silencing rather than genetic mutations [13, 14]. Clinical
studies also indicate that the levels of residual RECK
expression in resected tumor tissues positively correlate
with survival of the patients [12]. Down-regulation of
RECK is also found in the cells transformed by various
oncogenes, including activated RAS [7, 15, 16]. Such
down-regulation is probably essential for carcinogenesis,
since forced expression of RECK in cancer cells
suppresses tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis
as assessed by xenograft experiments in nude mice [7,
9]. These findings also imply that malignant behaviors of
tumor cells may be suppressed if the dormant endogenous
RECK in cancer cells be activated.
In the present study, we set up an assay system for
the discovery of small molecules that up-regulate Reck
promoter. Our pilot study with a small chemical library
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

demonstrated the value of this assay system in discovering
new anticancer drugs including those with anti-metastasis
activity.

RESULTS
Establishment of the screening system
Our previous study indicated that the 4.1-kb upstream fragment of mouse Reck gene contains elements
responsible for transcriptional repression by activated
RAS oncogenes as examined by luciferase reporter assay
[15]. We inserted this fragment up-stream of the secreted
alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene, a marker suitable
for high-throughput screening. As a recipient cell, we
chose to use a derivative of rat fibroblast cell line CREF
engineered to express HRAS12V oncogene under the control
of tetracycline-regulated trans-activator (Tet-off) system
(Fig. 1A, panel 1) [15], since this regulatable oncogene
was expected to facilitate our initial selection of indicator
cell lines that produce more SEAP when the oncogene is
repressed. Moreover, such a recipient cell should allow
us to compare the effects of a compound in the context of
transformed and non-transformed cells (Fig. 1A, panel 2).
Thus, in our complete assay format (Fig. 1 A, panel
3), the indicator cell line named YM3 is plated onto 96well plates in quadruplicate, two in growth medium
(RAS-on) and two in the medium containing doxycycline
(Dox; RAS-off), allowed to adhere for several hours, and
then treated with test chemicals for 48 h. A small portion
of culture supernatant was used for chemiluminescent
SEAP assay, and the remaining medium and the cells were
used for colorimetric quantification of viable cells. This
assay yields 4 sets of duplicate data which represent the
effects of chemicals on the following four parameters: (i)
the number of transformed cells, (ii) the SEAP activity
in transformed cells, (iii) the number of non-transformed
cells, and (iv) the SEAP activity in non-transformed
cells. In large-scale screenings, a simplified version using
one culture condition (e.g., in the absence of Dox) can
be employed, and then the selected compounds can be
further evaluated using the complete format in secondary
screening.

Pilot study with a small chemical library
To test the utility of this assay in drug screening, we
employed a chemical library composed of 880 structurally
diverse known bioactive compounds. The biological
mechanisms or pharmacological effects of these diverse
compounds have experimentally been verified, and more
than 85% of the compounds have been marketed either
in the United States or Europe as pharmaceuticals or

artifacts due to the particular batches of compounds or to
the cell line used in the screening.
Moreover, these chemicals could up-regulate
endogenous RECK protein in multiple human tumor cell
lines as examined by immunoblot assay (Fig. 2), with an
exception of Pyt, which showed little effects on RECK
expression in RZmet3 cells under these conditions.

supplements in a wide range of therapeutic areas. In the
primary screening, 151 chemicals were found to upregulate the expression of the SEAP reporter gene more
than hypothemycin (HPM), a positive control which
typically up-regulates the SEAP activity about two fold
by inhibiting MEK. In most cases, the extent of SEAP upregulation (i.e., fold-induction) was higher in transformed
cells than in non-transformed cells (e.g., Fig. 1B, black bar
vs. white bar) with a few exceptions, such as chlorhexidine
(Fig. 1B, bars 30).
We next performed dose-response studies with
the 151 chemicals to validate the results of the primary
screening and to determine their optimal concentrations
as well as maximal activities in this assay. Thirty-four
drugs that marked high scores (i.e., the extent of induction
in the absence of Dox) in this secondary screening are
listed in Table 1. These drugs can be classified into 8
categories based on their pharmacological activities
(Table 2). Among these, four chemicals (4/34 = 12%) are
tetracycline analogues (Table 1, in the “Class” column),
and they probably activate the Reck promoter by inhibiting
HRAS12V transactivation, which is supported by the lack
of activity in the presence of Dox (Table 1, the “Activity
in Dox” column). These tetracycline analogues may be
considered as a set of internal controls, and their 13-fold
enrichment (the original library contains 8 tetracycline
analogues: 8/880 = 0.9%) unintendedly demonstrate the
effectiveness of this assay.
Interestingly, eight of the 34 chemicals (8/34 =
24%; Table 1, asterisk in the “Class” column) are those
included in the 88-member FDA-Approved Oncology
Drugs Set (Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI,
USA), representing remarkable (12-fold) enrichment of
anticancer drugs (the original library contains 18 drugs
included in the FDA-Approved Oncology Drugs Set:
18/880 = 2%). Two other chemicals, camptothecine and
diaziquone (Table 1, Class II with no asterisk), may also
be classified as anticancer drugs. Hence, nearly one third
(10/34 = 29%) of the drugs selected in this experiment
represent classical anticancer drugs.

Effects of DSF on tumor cells in vitro
Among the chemicals that marked high scores in this
assay, DSF is of particular interest, since it consistently
up-regulates RECK in various tumor cell lines, downregulates gelatinases (see below), and
is Figure

relatively low toxicity in vivo [17]. We therefore chose to
mainly use this drug in our subsequent studies aiming to
find other bioassays useful in narrowing down promising
candidates.
Previous studies indicate that transfection of RECKexpression vector induces flat reversion (i.e., increased
cell-substrate adhesion) in transformed cells [7] and
suppresses cell migration in several cell types [18, 19].
We therefore examined the morphology and behavior
of RZmet3 cells in the absence or presence of DSF by
time-lapse video-microscopy (Fig. 3). DSF was found to
induce flattening/spreading of these cells (Fig. 3A, B) and
to reduce the speed in random migration (Fig. 3C). Hence,
DSF could recapitulate some effects of RECK-transgene
on the morphology and behavior of these sarcoma cells.

evaluation of anti-tumorigenic/anti-metastatic activity of
Reck-activating drugs in vivo, we established a luciferasetagged derivative of HT1080 (named RM72) that shows
spontaneous lung-metastasis within two weeks after
subcutaneous inoculation into nude mice. RM72 cells
were found to respond to the four chemicals by increased
RECK expression (Fig. 4A) and concomitant decreases
in the level of pro-MMP-9 in culture supernatant (Fig.
4B, panel 1 and 2). In addition, DSF could also lower the
levels of pro-MMP-2 as well as intermediate and mature
MMP-2 in culture supernatant (Fig. 4B, panels 3 and 4).
Given these promising results in vitro, we then
tested the effects of DSF on the growth and metastasis
of RM72 cells in nude mice. In this assay, RM72 cells
were inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice, allowed
to grow into small tumor for 5 days, and then treated with
DSF dissolved in olive oil (50 mg/kg/day) or vehicle
alone (control) by intraperitoneal injection for 14 days
(Fig. 4C). Under these conditions, DSF had no significant
effects on the volume of primary tumors (Fig. 4D, panels
1 and 2), and yet lung-metastasis was strongly suppressed
in the DSF-treated mice (Fig. 4D, panels 1 and 3). The
difference is even more significant when the extent of
metastasis is normalized against tumor volume (Fig. 4D,
panels 4). No obvious side effect was observed during
these experiments.
Taken together, these data demonstrate the utility
of our Reck-promoter-reporter assay using YM3 cells for
discovering promising candidates for cancer therapeutics,
which include anti-metastatic drugs with low toxicity
as well as conventional classes of anticancer drugs. The
RM72 cells also provide a powerful assay system that
allows us to rapidly assessing the effects of various agents
on tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.

RECK is down-regulated in a wide variety of tumors
and in the cells transformation by various oncogenes [7,
12, 15]; forced expression of RECK in tumor cells results
in suppression of tumor proliferation, angiogenesis,
invasion, and metastasis [7, 9]. RECK is therefore a useful
marker for benignancy and a promising target (or effector)
to be activated in cancer therapy. The Reck-promoterreporter assay may detect compounds that suppress
malignancy via multiple mechanisms: e.g., some may
suppress malignancy via activation of RECK while some
others may suppress malignancy by other mechanisms,
consequently up-regulating RECK. This assay therefore
has a feature of both molecular-targeting approach and
bioactivity-oriented approach. We also expected that
this assay may not detect cytotoxic drugs, since it relies
of a positive readout (i.e., promoter activation in viable
cells) rather than a negative one (e.g., cell killing or tumor
shrinkage).

Figure 4: Effects of DSF on RM72 cells. (A) Effect of various chemicals on the level of endogenous RECK protein in RM72 cells. The

cells (1 x 105 cells per 60-mm dish) plated on the previous day were treated with indicated drug (dosage: see legend to Fig. 2A, B) for 48 h, and
the level of RECK protein was estimated by immunoblot assay. Relative band intensities, normalized against GAPDH and then divided by the
value for vehicle (V; 1% DMSO), are given at the bottom. (B) Gelatin zymography with culture supernatant of RM72 cells treated with indicated
chemicals for 48 h (1). Intensity of the bands corresponding to pro-MMP-9, pro-MMP-2, and intermediate/mature MMP-2 were estimated using
MultiGauge software (FUJIFILM), normalized against the cell number as determined by SF assay, and presented in the separate bar graphs (2-4).
Dosage: DSF (16 µM), DXR (210 nM), Gra (32 nM), Pyt (5 µM), HPM (1 µg/ml), or pDTC (20 µM). (C, D) Effects of DSF on the growth and
lung metastasis of RM72 cells inoculated subcutaneously into nude mice. Nude mice bearing an RM72 tumor (diameter ~3 mm) were treated
(intraperitoneal injection) with vehicle (V) or DSF (50 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. Bioluminescence flux from whole body (top panels) and the lungs
(bottom panels) were recorded. Three animals from each group bearing a primary tumor of similar size are shown in (C). (D) Statistical data of

repeated twice with similar results.

To our surprise, however, our pilot screening
detected “cytotoxic” anticancer drugs very efficiently.
These drugs activate Reck promoter while killing the
cells; we also found many drugs in the library that kills
the cells without activating Reck promoter. Hence, our
finding may imply that RECK is a common effector for
these anticancer drugs. Alternatively, these drugs may
induce a common change in the cells that leads to RECK
up-regulation. Nevertheless, this assay must be useful
in finding new compounds with anticancer activities of
conventional types.
Could this screen be useful in finding new types
of anticancer drugs? In this particular case, could we
expect anticancer activities in any of the 20 non-ClassII compounds listed in Table 1 (excluding tetracycline
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

analogues)? One may argue that the activity to up-regulate
Reck may be just one of several properties found in
anticancer drugs so that only a fraction of Reck-activating
drugs (e.g., Class II) represent bona fide anticancer drugs.
Our observations with DSF, however, argue against this
possibility.
DSF has been used as an anti-alcoholism drug, since
it inhibits aldehydodehydrogenase in hepatocytes, leading
to an acute sensitivity to alcohol [21, 22]. In recent years,
several papers have suggested anticancer activities of
DSF (i.e., suppression of tumor growth, invasion in vitro,
and angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo) [17, 23-28]. Low
toxicity in vivo distinguishes DSF from classical cytotoxic
anticancer drugs [17]. Proposed mechanisms of its actions
include redox-related apoptosis [23], up-regulation of
259

Oncotarget 2010; 1: 252-264

metallothionein [28], inhibition of proteasome [26]
or superoxide dismutase-1 activity [24], and downregulation of several genes including MMP2, MMP9 [25,
27], CYP2E1 [29], and MCM [28]. This study not only
expands our knowledge on DSF by demonstrating its
activities to suppress spontaneous fibrosarcoma metastasis
and to up-regulate RECK but also strengthen our notion
that the Reck-promoter-reporter assay may be useful in
finding new types of anticancer therapeutics, including
agents with low toxicity in vivo and with anti-metastatic
activity. Some other drugs selected by this assay, such as
perhexiline, triamterene (Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors), and
piperlongumine (thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist),
also support this prospect, since anticancer activities
of cardiac glycosides (Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors) [30]
and the involvement of thromboxane A2 signaling in
angiogenesis and tumor metastasis [31, 32] have been
reported.
The observed effects of DSF on the behaviors of
HT1080 cells in culture (Figs. 2 and 3) are consistent with
the model that RECK plays an important role in DSFmediated metastasis suppression. Our preliminary data
indicate that RECK-depletion with siRNA suppresses
DSF-mediated pro-MMP-9 down-regulation (data
not shown), and this is consistent with the previous
observation by Takagi et al. that RECK suppresses MMP9
transcription [20]. It remains to be clarified, however, to
what extent the up-regulated RECK contributes to the
DSF-mediated metastasis suppression in vivo. Conditional
Reck mutant mice may be useful in addressing this issue.
In such studies, we may also be able to test the interesting
possibility that DSF and Reck suppress tumor metastasis
by regulating stem cell niche [33-35].
Given a promising assay system that can be adapted
to high throughput screenings, it is also important to have
independent and efficient assay systems for narrowing
down promising candidates. In this study, we tested
five assays, mainly using HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell
line and its derivatives: (i) luciferase reporter assay (to
assess the effects on the Reck promoter in human cells),
(ii) immunoblot assay with several human tumor cell
lines (to see whether endogenous RECK protein can
be up-regulated), (iii) gelatin zymography with culture
supernatant (to assess the effects on gelatinases), (iv) timelapse microscopy (to assess the effects on cell morphology
and motility), and (v) subcutaneous inoculation into nude
mice (to assess the effects on tumor growth and metastasis).
Among these assays, ii), iii) and v) seem to be useful for
our purpose. YM3 assay performed in the presence of
Dox is also useful in classifying the candidates into two
groups based on their dependence on RAS pathway.
Combination of two or more agents tested in one or more
of these assays may also be useful for classifying drugs
as well as for finding synergistic combinations of drugs.
Although it was an obvious option, we did not
choose to use Matrigel invasion assay for narrowing
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

down candidates, mainly because of its relatively high
cost. Instead, we concentrated on establishing a reliable
assay to monitor tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.
The luciferase-tagged, highly metastatic cell line RM72
is particularly useful for this purpose, since it allows us
to detect and quantify metastases as well as tumor growth
in living animals within a relatively short period of time,
typically in 3 weeks. Given the prevalence of carcinomas
among human malignancies, assays using epithelial
or carcinoma-derived cell lines may be considered
more appropriate. We believe, however, that the use of
mesenchymal cell lines, CREF and HT1080, as useful
model systems in early steps of drug screening can be
justified in light of the widely recognized importance
of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in carcinoma
progression [36]. Of course, the efficacy of candidate
drugs should also be tested in carcinoma models in later
steps of evaluation.
The chemicals detected by this assay may give us
some hints on the mechanisms of Reck gene regulation. For
instance, the list (Tables 1, 2) contains multiple compounds
sharing common activities or properties, such as heavymetal chelators, DNA-replication inhibitors, microtubules
inhibitors, dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, and protein
synthesis inhibitors. In fact, many of these drugs as well
as menadione [37] are potential generators of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) [38-42]. The four top-ranking
drugs, however, could up-regulate RECK in SW480 which
carries a mutant p53 gene [43] (Fig. 2D), suggesting p53independent nature of this response. Further studies to
understand how these drugs activate Reck transcription
may provide fresh insights into the mechanisms of
transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, malignant
transformation, and its suppression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal experiments
The experiments using mice had been approved by
Animal Research Committee, Kyoto University, and were
performed in accordance with MEXT Notice No. 71 and
the Act on Welfare and Management of Animals, Japan.

Cell lines and cell culture
The origins of cell lines used are as follows: CREF,
rat embryo fibroblast [44]; HT1080, human fibrosarcoma
[45]; A549 human lung adenocarcinoma [46]; SW480,
human colon adenocarcinoma [47]. These cells were
cultured in growth medium [DMEM (Nacalai), 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin-streptomycin] under
standard conditions. RZmet3, a derivative of HT1080

mg/ml G418.

SEAP assay and luciferase assay

Plasmids and transfection

YM3 cells seeded onto 96-well plates at 1 x 104
cells in 100 µl growth medium per well were incubated
for 5 h to allow the cells to settle. The drug solution
(500 µM, 1 µl) was added to the medium, and the plates
were incubated for additional 48 h. A portion (10 µl)
of culture supernatant was sampled, incubated at 65 °C
for 30 min, and then subjected to the SEAP assay using
Great EscAPeTM SEAP Chemiluminescence Detection
Kit (Takara Bio). The remaining medium and the cells
were subjected to the cell-counting assay using SF
reagent (Nacalai): i.e., SF reagent (10 µl per well) was
added to the medium, the plates were incubated for 3 h
in a CO2-incubator, and the absorbance at 450 nm (A450)
was measured. The SEAP chemiluminescence count was
divided by the A450 value to obtain SEAP activity (per
cell), which was further divided by SEAP activity of the
cells treated with vehicle (1% DMSO) to obtain relative
SEAP activity. The primary and the secondary (doseresponse) screenings were performed in duplicate, and the
validation study (with new batches of compounds) was
performed in quadruplicate. For luciferase reporter assay,
HT1080 cells stably transfected with pGL3-4110 [15] or
pGL3-Basic (Promega) were plated onto 96-well plate (5
x 104/well in 100 µl growth medium), incubated for 24
h, and 1 µl chemical solution (100-fold concentrate) or
vehicle (DMSO) was added per well. After incubation for
48 h, the cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase assay
using Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega).

A segment of mouse Reck gene promoter [4.1
kb KpnI-HindIII fragment from pGL3-4110 [15] was
inserted between the corresponding sites of pSEAP2Basic (Clontech) to generate pSEAP-RP4.1. Stable
transfection was performed using CalPhos Mammalian
Transfection Kit (Clontech) with purified cellular DNA as
carrier [Ratio (carrier:plasmid; w/w) = 1:3-1:5].

Establishments of indicator cells
A derivative of CREF cell line, named TF323-C3,
carrying the HRAS12V oncogene under the control of a
tetracycline-sensitive transactivator (Tet-off) system
has been described elsewhere [15]. TF323-C3 contains
neo marker and exhibits transformed morphology in
growth medium and flat morphology in the presence of
doxycycline (Dox; 2 µg/ml). TF323-C3 cells were cotransfected with pSEAP-RP4.1 mixed with pUCSVBSD [ratio (w/w) = 4:1] followed by selection in growth
medium containing 8 µg/ml blasticidine-S. A clone (named
YM3) that showed highest degree of SEAP up-regulation
(see below for SEAP assay) after Dox-treatment was
selected. SEAP was also up-regulated in YM3 cells after
treatment with hypothemycin (1 µg/ml), a MEK inhibitor
inducing flat reversion in v-K-ras-transformed cells [48,
49]. To establish an indicator cell line for assessing antitumorigenic and anit-metastatic activities of a drug in vivo,
RZmet3 cells were co-transfected with pGL4 (contaning
Photinus pyralis luciferase gene; Promega) mixed with
pcDNA3.1(-)-Hygro (Invitrogen), followed by selection
in growth medium containing hygromycin-B (400 U/ml).
Two clones stably expressing high levels of luciferase
were isolated and inoculated subcutaneously into nude
mice. After 4 weeks, metastatic foci were resected from
their lungs, dissociated, and cultured in growth medium
containing G418 and hygromycin-B. After re-cloning in
culture, one clone retaining high luciferase activity as well
as lung-metastatic activity was isolated and named RM72.

Immunoblot assay
The cells were lysed as described previously [9],
and the protein concentration was determined using DC
protein assay kit (BIO-RAD). Proteins separated by SDSPAGE (10% acrylamide) were subjected to immunoblot
assay using the mouse monoclonal anti-RECK antibody
(5B11D12), followed by re-probing with anti-GAPDH
antibody (6C5, Ambion). For visualization, the Enhanced
Chemiluminescence kit (Millipore) was used with
HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG-F (ab’)2 monoclonal
antibody (Cell Signaling) as a secondary antibody. Images
were recorded and analyzed using LAS-3000 and the
MultiGauge software (FUJIFILM).

Chemicals
The 880-member Prestwick Chemical Library
(Prestwick Chemical, Illkirch, France) dissolved in nanopure grade dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Wako) was used
for initial screening. Independent batches of disulfiram,
doxorubicin, gramicidin, pyrithione sodium salt, and
ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate were obtained

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Motility assay
RZmet3 cells (2 x 104) seeded onto a 35-mm glassbase dish (IWAKI) were incubated for 24 h, and the medium
was replaced with growth medium containing 1% DMSO

Cell movement was recorded by time-lapse microscopy
for 3 h (3-min interval) as described elsewhere [19]. The
speed of migration was calculated from a time series of
coordinates (reference point: center of the nucleus) using
Dunn’s formula [50]. Statistical significance was assessed

Tumor imaging in vivo
Mice were anesthetized and injected intraperitoneally
with 75 mg/kg of d-luciferin (Promega) in PBS(-).
Bioluminescence images were acquired with the IVIS
Imaging System (Xenogen) at 5 min after injection [51,
52]. Photons emitted from living mice or from isolated
organs were collected and integrated for a period of 60
seconds. Images were analyzed using the Living Image
software (Xenogen).

Human fibrosarcoma therapy model in nude mice
For spontaneous metastasis assays, RM72 cells (3 x
106) suspended in 0.1 ml PBS were injected subcutaneously
into the right posterior flank of Balb/c nude mice (6 week
old, male, Charles River). Small tumors (~3 x 3-mm
diameter) developed 5 days after injection. The mice were
randomly divided into two groups (n = 5 per group) and
treated with DSF (50 mg/kg/day) dissolved in olive oil or
olive oil alone (vehicle) via intraperitoneal injection using
24-gauge needles. After 14-d treatment, the mice were
anesthetized, and their bioluminescence was recorded
as described above. After the whole-body recording, the
lungs were resected, washed with PBS (-), and subjected
to bioluminescence recording. The tumor size (length x
width x height) was measured once a week. Statistical
significance was assessed by Student’s t-test.
