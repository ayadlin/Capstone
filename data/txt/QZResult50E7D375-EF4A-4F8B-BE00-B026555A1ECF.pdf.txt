BACKGROUND: Uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USPC) was an aggressive and chemotherapy resistant variant of
endometrial cancer. The authors evaluated the expression of human trophoblast-cell-surface-marker (Trop-2) and the
potential of hRS7, a humanized anti-Trop-2 monoclonal antibody, as a novel therapeutic strategy against USPC.
METHODS: Trop-2 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a total of 23 USPC. Six primary USPC
cell lines were assessed by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Trop-2 expression. Sensitivity to hRS7 (Immunomedics, Inc.) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent
cytotoxicity was tested in standard 5-hour 51Cr-release assays against primary USPC cell lines. RESULTS: Expression
of Trop-2 was found in 15 of 23 (65%) of the tumor tissues tested by IHC and in 50% (3 of 6) of the USPC cell lines
tested by real-time PCR and flow-cytometry (Trop-2 expression in USPC versus normal endometrial cells; P < .005).
USPC cell lines overexpressing Trop-2, regardless of their intrinsic resistance to natural killer cytotoxicity, were highly
sensitive to hRS7-mediated ADCC in vitro (range of killing, 28.2% to 64.4%) (P < .001). Negligible cytotoxicity against
USPC was seen in the absence of hRS7 or in the presence of rituximab control antibody (range of killing, 1.1% to
12.4%). Incubation with interleukin-2 (50 IU/mL) in addition to hRS7 further increased the cytotoxic activity against
USPC cell lines overexpressing Trop-2 (P ¼ .008). CONCLUSIONS: Trop-2 was highly expressed in uterine serous carcinoma at mRNA and protein levels. Primary USPC cell lines are highly sensitivity to hRS7-mediated cytotoxicity
in vitro. hRS7 may represent a novel therapeutic agent for USPC refractory to standard treatment modalities. Cancer

Cancer of the uterine corpus is the most prevalent gynecologic tumor in women, with an estimated 43,470 cases and
7950 deaths in the United States in 2010.1 Uterine serous papillary carcinoma (USPC) is an aggressive variant of endometrial cancer.2 Although it accounts for less than 10% of all endometrial tumors, it causes up to 39% of all endometrial
cancer-related deaths.3-6 USPC, referred to as a Type II endometrial cancer, is characterized by a high-grade, complex
histology and carries a poor prognosis as it is often spread beyond the uterine corpus at the time of diagnosis.2-6 Type I
and II endometrial cancers appear to have a different pattern of molecular alterations that underlie pathogenesis and
progression. While endometrioid carcinomas tend to have alterations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, these are
uncommon in USPC, with p53 mutations and HER2/neu expression occurring more commonly in this tumor subtype.7-9

USPC has a tendency toward early invasion of the lymphatic and vascular spaces and lymph nodes and to
microscopically involve other intraperitoneal structures,
despite minimal or no invasion present within the uterus.
These tumor characteristics lead to high recurrence rates
and a poor prognosis for USPC patients.2-9
Large-scale gene expression analysis, using techniques such as high-density oligonucleotide and cDNA
microarrays, represents a powerful new tool to identify
genes involved in endometrial carcinogenesis. Using this
technology, our group has recently identified the intronless gene encoding for trophoblast cell-surface marker
(Trop-2, also termed TACSTD2, GA733-1, M1S1,
EGP-1) as 1 of the top differentially expressed genes in
USPC when compared with normal human endometrial
cells (NEC).10 Trop-2 is a surface glycoprotein originally
identified in human placental trophoblast11 and subsequently reported to be highly expressed by various types
of human carcinomas, but rarely in normal adult
tissues.11-15 Although the biological role of Trop-2 is still
unclear, its overexpression has been found to correlate
with invasive behavior and poor prognosis in various types
of human carcinomas.16-19 Consistent with this view, our
group has recently reported Trop-2 as an independent
marker for poor overall survival in ovarian carcinoma
patients.20 Importantly, its overexpression by epithelial
tumor cells and its transmembrane localization render
Trop-2 an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy.
The hRS7 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody developed against Trop-2 using complementarydetermining region (CDR) and transfection techniques
of the murine RS7-3G11 antibody (Immunomedics,
Inc., Morris Plains, NJ).21-23 Since RS7-3G11 has been
shown to rapidly internalize into target cells,21-23 hRS7
has been initially tested labeled with 131I-IMP-R4 to
evaluate its effectiveness in preclinical radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) studies on breast cancer xenograft models.23
In these studies, nude mice bearing subcutaneous MDAMB-468 human breast cancer were treated with a single
administration of 131I-IMP-R4-hRS7. Mean tumor volumes (MTVs) 8 weeks post-treatment were 20% and
280% of the starting MTVs in 131I-IMP-R4-hRS7treated and untreated control groups, respectively. Moreover, complete remission was reported in 5 of 11 mice
treated with 131I-IMP-R4-hRS7.23 Although these
results suggest a promising use of hRS7 as a carrier for
radiometabolic therapy after labeling with suitable radionuclides, to our knowledge, the ability of hRS7 in inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)

3164

against primary human USPC cell lines has not been
previously studied.
To fill this gap in knowledge, in this study we
investigated the expression of Trop-2 in multiple USPC
specimens and evaluated the in vitro potential of hRS7
as a novel immunotherapeutic agent against biologically
aggressive and chemotherapy resistant USPC cell lines
overexpressing Trop-2.

METHODS
Trop-2 Immunostaining of
Formalin-Fixed Tumor Tissues
A total of 23 USPC specimens (18 primary and 5 metastatic obtained from uterine serous tumors with single cell
differentiation, ie, pure USPC), and 5 normal endometrium control tissues obtained from similar age women
were evaluated by standard immunohistochemical staining (IHC) on formalin-fixed tumor tissue for Trop-2
surface expression. USPC specimens were derived from
patients harboring stage I disease (5 patients), stage II
(2 patients), stage III (7 patients), and stage IV (9
patients). Briefly, IHC stains were performed on 4-lmthick sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
as previously described.20 The purified goat polyclonal
antibody against the recombinant human Trop-2
extracellular domain (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis,
MN; diluted 1:100) was applied for 1 hour. A secondary
biotinylated anti-goat antibody (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA; diluted 1:250) and the streptavidin–
biotin complex (StreptABComplex/HRP, Dako, CA)
were applied, then 30 3-diaminobenzidine (Dako) was
used as chromogen and the sections were counterstained
by hematoxylin (Dako). Cases with less than 10%
membranous staining in tumor cells were considered negative for Trop-2 expression. The intensity of membranous
immunoreactivity for Trop-2 in tumor cells was subjectively scored as follow: a) 0, negative; b) 1þ, weak membrane staining; c) 2þ, medium staining; and d) 3þ,
strong membrane staining. Appropriate negative and
positive controls were performed with each case. Trop-2
immunoreactivity scores were performed blindly by
2 pathologists. The interobserver variability in sample
scoring was less than 10%.
Establishment of USPC Cell Lines
Primary USPC tumor cell lines from 6 patients with invasive USPC were obtained from fresh tumor biopsies collected at the time of surgery, under approval of the

Institutional Review Board. Tumors were staged according to the International Federation of Gynecologists and
Obstetricians 1988 operative staging system. Six primary
USPC cell lines (USPC ARK-1, USPC ARK-2, USPC
ARK-3, USPC ARK-4, USPC ARK-5, and USPC ARK6) were established after sterile processing of the tumor
samples from surgical biopsies as described previously.24
Source-patient characteristics of these 6 USPC cell lines
are described in Table 1. The amplification of the c-erbB2
gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization, expression levels of HER-2/neu receptor by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) and mRNA expression levels by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for these primary USPC cell lines have been recently reported.24

Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase
Chain Reaction
RNA isolation from all the 6 primary USPC cell lines
used in the cytotoxicity experiments and normal endometrium control tissues obtained from the same healthy
donors used for the IHC staining experiments were performed using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions as previously described.20
Since Trop-2 is an intronless gene, all RNA samples were
treated with TURBO DNase enzyme (TURBO DNAfree Kit; Ambion, Inc., Applied Biosystem Business, CA)
to remove the contaminating DNA eventually present.
The qRT-PCR was performed in duplicate by using a
primer set and probe specific for Trop-2 (ie, Trop2-EX56,
forward: CGCCTTGGGTTTAAATTATTTGATGA
GT; reverse: GCTACTACATAGGCCCAGTTAACAA).
The endogenous control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Assay on Demand Hs99999905_
m1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used to
normalize variations in cDNA quantities from different
samples. The comparative threshold cycle (CT) method
was used for the calculation of amplification fold as specified by the manufacturer.

Flow Cytometry
The humanized anti-Trop-2 MAb hRS7 (Immunomedics, Inc., Morris Plains, NJ) was used for flow cytometry
studies. Briefly, 6 primary USPC cell lines obtained from
the above described patients were stained with 2 lg/mL of
hRS7. A total of 2.5 lg/mL of the chimeric anti-CD20
MAb rituximab (Rituxan, Genentech, San Francisco, CA)
was used as a negative control. A goat anti-human F(ab0 )2
immunoglobulin (BioSource International, Camarillo,
CA) was used as a secondary reagent. Analysis was conducted with FACScan, using Cell Quest software (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
Tests for ADCC
A standard 5-hour chromium (51Cr) release assay was
performed to measure the cytotoxic reactivity of FicollPaqueTM PLUS (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) separated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) obtained from
several healthy donors against all 6 USPC cell lines. The
release of 51Cr from the target cells was measured as evidence of tumor cell lysis after exposure of tumor cells to
2 lg/mL of hRS7. Controls included the incubation of
target cells alone or with PBLs or monoclonal antibody
(mAb) separately. The chimeric anti-CD20 MAb rituximab was used as a negative control for hRS7 in all bioassays. ADCC was calculated as the percentage of killing of
target cells observed with hRS7 plus effector cells compared with 51Cr release from target cells incubated alone.
Interleukin-2 Enhancement of ADCC
To investigate the effect of interleukin-2 (IL-2) on hRS7mediated ADCC, effector PBLs were incubated for 5
hours at 37 C at a final concentration of IL-2 (Aldesleukin; Chiron Therapeutics, Emeryville, CA), ranging from
50 to 100 IU/mL in 96-well microtiter plates. Target cells
were primary USPC cell lines exposed to 2 lg/mL of
hRS7, whereas controls included the incubation of target
cells alone or with PBLs in the presence or absence of IL-2
or mAb, respectively. Rituximab was used as a control

Original Article

mAb. ADCC was calculated as the percentage of killing of
target cells observed with mAb plus effector PBLs, as compared with target cells incubated alone. Each experiment
was performed with PBLs obtained from at least 2 healthy
donors.
Test for Complement-Mediated Target Cell
Lysis and c-Globulin Inhibition
A standard 5-hours chromium (51Cr) release assay identical to those performed for ADCC assays was used, except
that human serum in a dilution of 1:2 was added in place
of the effector cells. This human serum was used as a
source of complement to test for complement-mediated
target cell lysis. To evaluate the eventual inhibition of
ADCC against USPC cell lines by physiologic human serum concentrations of c-globulin, human serum diluted
1:2 was added in the presence or absence of effector PBLs.
In some experiments, heat-inactivated human serum
(56 C for 60 minutes) was added in the presence of
effector PBLs. Controls included the incubation of target
cells alone or with either lymphocytes or mAb separately.
Rituximab was used as a control mAb.
Statistical Analysis
For qRT-PCR data, the right skewing was removed by
taking copy number ratios relative to the lowest-expressing
NEC sample (relative copy number), log2 transforming
them to DCTs, and comparing the results by means of
unequal-variance t-test for USPC-versus-NEC. Group
means with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
by computing them on the DCTs and then reverse-transforming the results to obtain means (with 95% CIs) of
relative copy numbers. Differences in Trop-2 expression by
flow cytometry were analyzed by the unpaired t-test, and a P
value of <.05 among samples was considered to be significant. The Wilcoxon rank-sum (WRS) test was used to compare USPC types with normal endometrium for differences
in IHC staining intensities. Sample-type differences were
expressed as odds ratios accompanied by 95% confidence
limits. Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-square analysis were used
to evaluate differences in hRS7-induced ADCC levels in
primary tumor cell lines. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 17 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).

surface of tumor cells, we performed immunohistochemical
analysis on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue
from a set of 23 USPCs. As representatively shown in
Figure 1, we found membranous positivity for Trop-2 in
15 of the 23 (65%) tumor samples tested by IHC. The
intensity of Trop-2 staining was significantly higher among
the tumor specimens compared with normal endometrial
controls (WRS P value ¼ <.005). In these positive samples,
3 of the 23 specimens were found to have a low positivity
(1þ) for Trop-2 protein, while the remaining specimens
available for IHC testing showed moderate (ie, 2þ, 7
samples) or strong (ie, 3 þ: 5 samples) Trop-2 positivity.

tested, 3 carcinomas (ie, USPC ARK-2, USPC ARK-3,

ranging from 410.0 to 1628.6 (Table 2). Trop-2 expression was significantly higher in the USPC cell lines compared with the NEC (P ¼ .005). In contrast, low Trop-2
expression by qRT-PCR was detected in the other 3 cell
lines, ranging from 0.1 to 30.2 mRNA copy numbers (TaTable 2. Trop-2 mRNA and Protein Expression in USPC

Trop-2 Surface Expression by Flow

To determine whether the high expression of Trop-2
mRNA detected by qRT-PCR in 50% of our USPC cell
lines also resulted in high expression of the protein on the
surface of tumor cells, we performed flow cytometry on
all primary tumors. USPC ARK-2, USPC ARK-3 and
USPC ARK-6 cell lines showed once again high Trop-2
surface expression by flow cytometry (Fig. 2; Table 2).
Trop-2 surface expression results from flow cytometric
analysis were found to be in good agreement with Trop-2
expression results found by qRT-PCR in all 6 primary
USPC cell lines. The difference in Trop-2 surface protein
expression tested by flow cytometry between the cell lines
with low and high Trop-2 expression was statistically significant (P < .01).

USPC Cell Lines Are Highly Resistant
to NK Cell Activity But Sensitive to
hRS7-Mediated ADCC
Six primary USPC cell lines were evaluated for their sensitivity to natural killer cells (NK). These cell lines were
exposed to PBLs collected from multiple healthy donors
and the cytotoxicity was measured using a standard 5-hrs
51
Cr release assay. Using dose titration experiments with
different doses of hRS7, killing of the USPC cells was
found to plateau at a hRS7 concentration of 2 lg/mL
(data not shown). Thus, this dose was used in all following
experiments. USPC cell lines were found highly resistant
to NK-mediated killing with exposure to PBLs as effectors
to target at 2 ratios (E/T; 25:1 and 50:1) (mean killing
5.8%  3.5 SD) (Table 3). In contrast, significant killing
was demonstrated against high Trop-2 expressing cell lines
after incubation with hRS7 to mediate ADCC (range of
killing, 28.2%-64.4%; mean, 46.3%; P < .001) (Fig. 3,
upper and middle panel, Table 3), while low Trop-2
expressing cell lines were resistant to hRS7 (Fig. 3, lower
panel; Table 3). As expected by qRT-PCR and flow
cytometry results of Trop-2 expression, high Trop-2–
expressing cell lines were killed at a higher level by hRS7
than low Trop-2–expressing cell lines (Table 3; P < .001).
All cell lines were resistant to incubation with rituximab
(2.5 lg/mL) control antibody in the presence of PBLs
(Table 3).
IL-2 Enhancement of ADCC Against USPC
To investigate the effect of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in combination with hRS7 (2 lg/mL) on ADCC against USPC
cell lines overexpressing Trop-2, PBLs from healthy
donors were incubated with 50 to 100 IU/mL of IL-2 for
5 hours. As representatively shown in Figure 4, hRS7mediated ADCC was significantly increased in the presence of IL-2 in all primary cell lines tested (P ¼ .008).

3168

While the stimulation of PBLs with IL-2 leads to a significantly higher ADCC in the presence of hRS7, it did not
significantly increase tumor killing in the absence of hRS7
or in the presence of rituximab control antibody (Fig. 4).
Effect of Complement and Physiologic
Concentrations of IgG on hRS7Mediated ADCC
To evaluate the effect of complement on the hRS7-mediated ADCC as well as its potential inhibition by physiologic IgG serum concentrations, human serum diluted
1:2 (with and without heat inactivation) was added to
high Trop-2–expressing USPC cell lines (ie, USPC ARK2, USPC ARK-3, and USPC ARK-6) during standard 5hour 51Cr-release assays in the presence of PBLs. As representatively demonstrated in Figure 5 for USPC ARK-2, in
2 primary cell lines (ie, USPC ARK-2 and USPC ARK6), no significant decrease in killing after incubation with
serum compared with incubation without serum was
noted. In contrast, in USPC ARK-3 cell line, the addition
of serum led to a significant increase in killing (P ¼ .02)
(Fig. 5). These results are consistent with a higher sensitivity of USPC ARK-3 cell line to complement in vitro when
compared with USPC ARK-2 and USPC ARK-6.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have investigated Trop-2 expression and
localization by immunohistochemistry in normal endometrium, and compared such expression with primary
and metastatic uterine serous tumors. In addition we have
evaluated the in vitro potential of hRS7 MAb as a new
form of therapy against biologically aggressive and chemotherapy resistant USPC cell lines overexpressing Trop-2
in vitro. Our findings demonstrate that: a) Trop-2 mRNA
and protein are significantly up-regulated in USPC

Trop-2 and poor overall survival.20 Although the relationship between high Trop-2 expression and aggressiveness
of epithelial neoplasms remains unclear, it has been
suggested that Trop-2, possessing cytoplasmic serine and
tyrosine phosphorylation sites, might function as a cell
signal transducer and regulator of tumor cell growth and
increase tumor cell resistance to apoptosis.25 Consistent
with this view, a recent study has evidenced that a large
fraction of human cancers express a bicistronic CYCLIN
D1-TROP2 mRNA chimera, acting as an oncogene able
to induce aggressive tumor growth.26 Another recent
study has reported that Trop-2 is necessary for tumorigenesis in colon carcinoma cell lines, showing that Trop-2
targeting with specific antibodies may result in inhibition

3170

of tumor cell migration and invasion.27 Taken together,
these observations support the possibility that aberrant
expression of Trop-2 may account for the enhanced
invasive behavior and increased biologic aggressiveness of
multiple human cancers including USPC.
Although in vivo data will ultimately be necessary to
validate the potential of hRS7 against Trop-2 expressing
USPC, our in vitro experimental results suggest that
targeting cancer cells with high surface expression of
Trop-2, may be a novel, potentially effective option to
treat residual/resistant USPC after standard adjuvant
chemotherapy. Consistent with this view, in this study we
have tested the ability of hRS7, a human anti–Trop-2
antibody,20 for its ability to kill in vitro multiple primary
USPC cell lines expressing different levels of Trop-2. In
this regard, 3 of 6 of the primary USPC cell lines available
to this study were found to express significant levels of
Trop-2 by flow cytometry, and this expression did not
correlate with HER2/neu expression.24 Therefore, USPC
cell lines may potentially respond to anti-Trop-2 therapy,
regardless of their different sensitivity/resistance to various
chemotherapy or immunotherapy (ie, anti-HER2/neutargeted) agents.24,28 In agreement with our qRT-PCR
and protein expression results, all high Trop-2 expressing
primary USPC cell lines were highly sensitive to ADCC
in the presence of hRS7. These data, therefore, demonstrate that although these tumor cells are extremely resistant to multiple clinically available chemotherapeutic
agents, they remain highly sensitive to lysis by NK cells
when these are engaged by the Trop-2-specific antibody
hRS7.
To test the feasibility of hRS7-induced ADCC in the
in vivo setting, ADCC experiments were performed in the
presence of human serum as a source of high concentrations
of irrelevant human IgG that could potentially block the
ability of effector cells to interact with the antibody at the
target site. In this study, we show that ADCC against
USPC cell lines was not significantly decreased by high concentrations (up to 50%) of human serum. Indeed, in some
USPC cell lines (ie, USPC-ARK-3) an increase in cell death
was detected in the presence of effector cells and non-heat
inactivated human serum. These results indicate that the
binding of hRS7 to the Fc receptor on mononuclear effector cells is likely enabled in the in vivo situation.
Treatment of cancer patients with combinations of
MAbs and cytokines does not amount to a mere addition
to the benefit of each treatment modality alone, but has
been demonstrated to have synergistic potential.29,30

continuous infusion or subcutaneously, with remarkable
immunologic results coupled with negligible toxicity.30,31
Indeed, subcutaneous IL-2 increased the absolute number
of circulating NK cells by approximately 10-fold and
induced an increase in the function of these lymphocytes
against a series of cancer targets.29,30 This point is noteworthy because oncology patients have been noted to have
suppressed ADCC responses.30 However, cytotoxicity
levels in such patients can be increased in vitro to levels
similar to those of normal donors by exposing effector
cells to IL-2.31 Our findings further support this view, as a
significant increase in ADCC against USPC was detected
after exposure of effector cells to low doses of IL-2 in vitro
for a brief time (ie, for 5 hours). These data suggest that
the administration of low (ie, nontoxic) doses of IL-2 in
vivo may enhance the function of NK cells and may significantly increase the efficacy of hRS7 therapy in USPC
patients. Furthermore, given the aggressive and highly resistant nature of USPC to currently available cytotoxic
anticancer therapies, these combined therapies might be
particularly important in the treatment of USPC patients.
In conclusion, this is the first report on Trop-2 protein expression and hRS7 antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity in USPC, the most aggressive and chemotherapy-resistant variant of endometrial cancer. Our study has
demonstrated that Trop-2 expression is highly and consistently expressed at protein levels in 65% of primary and
metastatic USPC tested by IHC, as well as at both mRNA
and protein levels in 50% of primary cell lines established
from patients harboring chemotherapy resistant tumors
tested by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. The high density
and the membranous localization of Trop-2 on USPC
cells, combined with its negative expression in mesothelial
type cells in the abdominal cavity (data not shown), suggests that this protein could represent an accessible tumor
target antigen for both intravenous (i.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) antibody-based therapies. This holds particularly true for USPC patients where other potentially
effective targeted in vivo therapies (ie, trastuzumab)32,33
are not indicated due to the lack of expression of its target
HER2/neu on USPC cells.
