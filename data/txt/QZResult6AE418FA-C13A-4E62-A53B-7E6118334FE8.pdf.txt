degradation (ERAD) [5]. Various forms of the proteotoxic
stress response can play cytoprotective roles at early
intervals, but when the protein load exceeds a certain
threshold, they can instead contribute to cellular demise
[6].
The increased reliance of transformed cells on
systems that ameliorate the deleterious effects of
proteotoxic stress has stimulated the development of
multiple strategies and agents specifically designed to
disable these mechanisms. For example, intense efforts
have been directed at developing inhibitors of Hsp90, and
several such agents i.e., geldanamycin and more current
derivatives such as DMAG, have now entered the clinical
arena [7]. Furthermore, the observation that Hsp90
antagonists stimulate the HSF1-dependent induction of
Hsp70, and that the latter protein can protect transformed
cells from Hsp90 inhibitor-mediated lethality, has
prompted the development of Hsp70 antagonists, to be
used either alone or possibly in combination with Hsp90
inhibitors [8]. However, the greatest success to date with
this group of compounds is that of inhibitors of the 26S
proteasome such as bortezomib, which among numerous
actions, block protein degradation and in so doing,
promote the accumulation of misfolded proteins [9].
Notably, bortezomib has been approved for the treatment
of refractory mantle cell lymphoma, as well as relapsed
multiple myeloma, a disease characterized by pronounced
protein turnover.
Not surprisingly, attempts to combine these strategies
in the hope of exceeding the proteotoxic stress threshold
and triggering cell death have attracted considerable
attention. For example, preclinical studies have shown
that simultaneously disrupting Hsp90 function (i.e.,
with Hsp90 antagonists) and interfering with protein
degradation (i.e., by proteasome inhibitors) markedly
increases transformed cell death [10], and attempts to
translate this strategy into the clinic are currently underway.
Similarly, evidence that Hsp70 induction can compensate
for inhibition of Hsp90 function has prompted a strategy

Transformed cells are known to differ from their
normal counterparts in a wide variety of ways, including
their increased reliance on aerobic glycolysis, defects in
DNA damage checkpoint controls, diminished reliance
on growth factors for survival, dysregulation of cell cycle
control mechanisms, and propensity for dissemination
beyond their normal environment, among numerous others.
In 2000, Weinberg described six essential “hallmarks of
cancer”, providing a theoretical framework for exploiting
the transformed state from a therapeutic standpoint [1].
In 2009, Elledge expanded this list to 12 characteristics,
including several described as “orthogonal” elements [2].
These processes were invoked to explain the paradoxical
observation that certain oncogenes, such as c-myc, while
conferring a proliferation advantage on transformed
cells, may nevertheless exert pro-apoptotic activities.
Consequently, a second aberration (i.e., up-regulation of
an anti-apoptotic protein such as Bcl-2) may allow cells to
escape the otherwise lethal effects of c-myc dysregulation,
and in so doing, cooperate in transformation [3].
Another important “orthogonal” characteristic
of transformed cells is their capacity to withstand the
accumulation of un- or misfolded proteins, referred to
as proteotoxic stress. Neoplastic cells in general exhibit
increased protein turnover, and certain tumors e.g.,
multiple myeloma, have extremely high turnover rates.
Ordinarily, such proteins are dealt with by ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome
system (UPS), and this process is facilitated by the
induction of a variety of protein chaperones, including
members of the heat shock protein family (i.e., Hsp90 and
Hsp70) [4]. Increased accumulation of misfolded proteins
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can also lead to
another form of proteotoxic stress referred to as ER stress.
In this case, the unfolded protein response (UPR) consists
of various compensatory events, including increased
synthesis of ER chaperone proteins, shut-down of protein
synthesis (i.e., by PERK/eIF2α), and accelerated protein

combining Hsp90 and Hsp70 inhibitors, and this approach
has also been found to potentiate neoplastic cell death [8].
In this context, interest has recently focused on HDAC
inhibitors as potential modulators of the proteotoxic
stress response. For example, it has been shown that
inhibition of HDAC6 leads to disruption of the dynein
motor responsible for the normal function of aggresomes,
which are intimately involved in regulating the proper
disposition and subsequent elimination of misfolded
proteins [11]. The ability of pan-HDAC inhibitors, which
target HDAC6, to disrupt aggresome function has been
invoked to explain their potentiation of the antitumor
activity of bortezomib i.e., in multiple myeloma cells
[12]. In some cells e.g., mantle cell lymphoma cells, this
interaction may also involve shifting of the ER stress
response from a cytoprotective to a pro-apoptotic process
[13].
To date, most approaches attempting to exploit
proteotoxic stress from a therapeutic standpoint have
focused on combining agents that disable different
components of the proteotoxic stress response e.g.,
chaperone proteins and proteasome function. However,
results of a study by Neznanov et al., recently reported
in Oncotarget [14] suggest a fundamentally different
approach to this problem. Neznanov and colleagues
employed the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib to
enhance proteotoxic stress of transformed cells subjected
to interventions that by themselves increased the cell’s
burden of misfolded proteins i.e., hyperthermia or the
antibiotic puromycin, which causes premature termination
of translation leading to the accumulation of misfolded
proteins. These investigators found that combined
treatment of transformed cells with hyperthermia or
puromycin with bortezomib, at exposures that were
minimally toxic individually, resulted in a marked increase
in protein ubiquitination and cell death. Notably, lethality
occurred despite the marked induction of HSF-1-mediated
induction of the cytoprotective chaperone protein Hsp70.
In addition, while intact p53 function was not required for
cell death induced by this strategy, its presence resulted in
an increase in lethality. Importantly, the combination of
puromycin and bortezomib resulted in enhanced antitumor
activity in a murine xenograft model, suggesting that this
phenomenon is not restricted to the in vitro setting.
The results of this study have potentially important
implications, including those that are translational in
nature. Currently, considerable interest has focused on
targeting those pathways to which transformed cells
are either addicted [15] and/or uniquely reliant due
to enhanced tumor cell requirements e.g., handling
of increased protein turnover or DNA damage [16].
However, it has become increasingly apparent that with
rare exceptions, interruption of a single pathway or
process is unlikely to have a major benefit in of itself;
instead, interruption of multiple complementary pathways
may be necessary [17]. In the case of proteotoxic stress,

past and current approaches have understandably involved
the rational combination agents that disrupt various
cellular mechanisms designed to cope with this problem
e.g., proteasome and chaperone protein antagonists. It
is presumed that the inherent reliance of tumor cells on
such protein disposal mechanisms should be sufficient to
ensure adequate antitumor activity of these strategies. The
implications of the report by Neznanov et al., are that this
assumption may not be justified i.e., simply disrupting
the proteotoxic stress response at multiple sites may not
be sufficient for significant therapeutic benefit, even in
those transformed cells known exhibit increased protein
turnover. Instead, interventions that increase the cell’s
burden of misfolded proteins, including hyperthermia or
disruptors of translation, may represent superior candidates
for combination with proteasome inhibitors (or possibly
other agents that interfere with protein disposition) in the
clinical setting. In this context, a variety of agents known
to block protein translation (e.g., ribavarin, sorafenib)
deserve scrutiny [18, 19]. Questions remaining to be
addressed include determining whether such strategies
do in fact selectively target transformed cells, assessing
whether the benefit of these strategies will be restricted
to neoplastic cells characterized by high protein turnover,
and identifying optimal regimens combining agents
that promote proteotoxic stress with those that disrupt
protein disposition. It is anticipated that answers to these
questions may be forthcoming at both the preclinical and
clinical levels in the years to come.
