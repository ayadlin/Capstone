ABSTRACT
Transmembrane 4 L six family member 4 (TM4SF4) is a member of the tetraspanin
L6 domain family. Other members of this family, TM4SF1 (also known as L6-Ag)
and TM4SF5, have been shown to be upregulated in multiple tumors and involved in
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cell migration. However, unlike its homologs,
little is known about TM4SF4. Here, we show that TM4SF4 was highly expressed in
radiation-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells, such as A549 and Calu-3 cells, and its
expression activated cell growth, migration, and invasion. Overexpression of TM4SF4
in A549 cells increased the activation of PI3K, AKT, and NF-kappaB and the expression
of PTEN. IGF1R was clearly activated by overexpression of TM4SF4, although EGFR
was also slightly activated. TM4SF4 expression was correlated with the increased
expression of IGF1, consequently resulting in IGF1R activation. Tumorigenic activity
of TM4SF4 in lung adenocarcinoma cells was also demonstrated by xenograft assay;
however, this activity was almost completely suppressed by treatment with antiTM4SF4 antibody. Our results suggest that TM4SF4 overexpression in lung carcinoma
cells results in resistance to radiotherapy via IGF1-induced IGF1R activation and
blocking the activity of TM4SF4 using specific antibody can be a promising therapeutics
against TM4SF4-overexpressing lung adenocarcinoma.

INTRODUCTION

are reported to be involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition [7, 14], which is also associated with stemness
properties [15].
TM4SF4 was originally cloned from intestinal
epithelium and liver; for this reason, it was named
intestine and liver tetraspan membrane protein (ILTMP) [16, 17]. TM4SF4 is a 202-amino acid membrane
protein that contains four hydrophobic transmembrane
domains and two hydrophilic regions [1]. It is classified
as a more divergent member of the tetraspanin L6 domain
family, owing to a lack of characteristic cysteine residue
motifs in the EC2 extracellular domain, and has 50%
sequence identity with L6 protein TM4SF1[1]. TM4SF4
levels appear to increase when non-dividing epithelial

Transmembrane 4 L six family member 4
(TM4SF4) is a member of the tetraspanin L6 domain
family [1], which includes TM4SF1/L6, TM4SF4/ILTMP, and TM4SF5/L6H. TM4SF1 and TM4SF5 were
originally identified as tumor-associated antigens [2,
3], and their overexpression was reported in multiple
tumors, including lung, breast, colon, prostate cancer, and
hepatocellular carcinoma [2, 4-8]. TM4SF1 and TM4SF5
affect migratory mechanisms crucial to cancer invasion
and metastasis [2, 4, 9-11], making them as crucial targets
for cancer therapy [10, 12]. Also, TM4SF1 is defined as a
cancer stem cell marker [13], and TM4SF1 and TM4SF5

cells differentiate and migrate out of intestinal crypts
[16]. Likewise, in the liver, TM4SF4 is expressed in
non-dividing hepatocytes that retain high proliferative
potential in the presence of the appropriate stimulus, and
is upregulated during liver injury [17, 18], which implies
that its functions are related to cellular differentiation or
proliferation. However, little is known about functions of
TM4SF4 in cancer cells. Only recently, it was reported
that TM4SF4/IL-TMP mRNA and protein levels were
upregulated in 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma tissues
[19].
Lung cancer is a lethal cancer in both men and
women. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises
the majority (greater than 75%) of lung cancers and,
when clinically extensive, it is typically characterized
by inexorable disease progression despite treatment
with chemotherapy and/or irradiation [20]. Because
chemotherapy and irradiation induce programmed cell
death, or apoptosis, recent efforts have been made to
understand molecular events that confer therapeutic
resistance. Based on these efforts, the phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (AKT) pathway [21]
and the IGF1/IGF1R signaling pathway [22] have emerged
as potential determinants of radiation resistance in human
lung cancer cells.
Here, we show that TM4SF4 is highly expressed
in radiation-resistant lung adenocarcinoma cells, such as
A549 and Calu-3 cells, and its expression activates cell
growth, migration, and invasion via IGF1R activation.
Overexpression of TM4SF4 elevated the level of
IGF1 induction, which resulted in IGF1R activation
and radiation resistance. Treatment of TM4SF4overexpressing lung carcinoma cells with anti-TM4SF4
antibody suppressed cell growth, which was mediated by
suppression of IGF1 expression. Based on these results,
we discuss the use of anti-TM4SF4 antibody against
TM4SF4-overexpressing and radiation-resistant lung
cancer therapy.

that observed in H460 cells (data not shown). Based on
these results, expression of TM4SF4 in various NSCLC
cells, including A549, H460, H23, Calu-3, H1299, H2009
and H358 cells, were analyzed by RT-PCR and Western
blotting (Figure 1A). Most of lung cancer cells examined
expressed low levels of TM4SF4; however, A549 and
Calu-3 cells showed exceptionally high levels of TM4SF4
expression.
A significant difference in gene expression is usually
regulated by DNA methylation, a common epigenetic
signaling tool that cells use to repress transcription.
To examine the regulation of TM4SF4 expression by
methylation in the NSCLC cells tested above, puta­tive
CpG islands within the promoter and 5’-untranslated
region (5’-UTR) of the TM4SF4 gene were analyzed
using the Methprimer program (http://www.urogene.org//
methprimer) [25], and two CpG islands were suggested
as methylation sites (Figure 1B). In A549 cells, the two
positions were methylated less than 10%. In contrast, the
TM4SF4 gene in H460 cells showed a level of methylation
greater than 50% (Figure 1C). The methylation percentage
of the TM4SF4 gene was also analyzed in other lung
cancer cells. As shown in Figure 1D, lung cancer
cells including H23, H1299 and H358, showed high
methylation levels, of greater than 80%. However, Calu-3
cells as well as A549 cells showed very low levels, of less
than 10% DNA methylation.
In normal lung cells, TM4SF4 is expressed at a very
low level [17]. Also, previous studies of TM4SF4 were
focused on its functions in intestinal epithelium and liver
and showed that TM4SF4 is a negative regulator of cell
proliferation [16, 18]. Therefore, TM4SF4 functions in
cancer, especially in lung cancer, have not been studied,
although other members of the tetraspanin L6 family,
such as TM4SF1 and TM4SF5, have been investigated as
inducers of tumorigenesis. Based on our findings about
the expression and methylation patterns of TM4SF4 in
NSCLC cells, we hypothesized that overexpression of
TM4SF4 in some aggressive NSCLC adenocarcinoma
cells is critical for tumorigenesis and radiation resistance,
and we examined this hypothesis using TM4SF4overexpressing or knockdown A549 NSCLC cells.

RESULTS
TM4SF4 is overexpressed in radiation-resistant
lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.

Overexpression of TM4SF4 in A549 cells
enhanced cell growth, migration, and invasion.

A549 NSCLC adenocarcinoma cancer cells are
more invasive and resistant to radiation than the H460
NSCLC cell line [23, 24]. To identify novel genes involved
in radiation resistance of NSCLC cells, expression levels
of 30,000 human genes in A549 and H460 cells were
compared using DNA microarray analysis. Among
hundreds of differentially regulated genes, a dramatic
difference in the expression level of TM4SF4 was
observed between these cells; A549 cells expressed
TM4SF4 at a level approximately 30-fold greater than

First, we analyzed the effect of downregulation of
TM4SF4 in A549 cells to examine whether the suppression
of TM4SF4 inhibit the tumorigenicity of A549 cells.
Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated suppression of
TM4SF4 in A549 cells (Figure 2A) retarded cell growth,
which was reduced to 50% of control value (Figure 2B).
Resistance to gamma irradiation was also decreased
severely. Gamma irradiation reduced relative colony
formation by A549 cells to 62%, and that of TM4SF49824

knockdown cells to 38%, of the level seen in control cells
(Figure 2B). To monitor cell migration, a wound healing
assay was performed. As shown in Figure 2C, the rate of
wound closure was slower in TM4SF4-knockdown cells.
Results of transwell migration assay showed the same
tendencies (Figure 2D, upper panel). It was also confirmed
that TM4SF4 is involved in invasiveness of tumor cells.
With suppression of TM4SF4, invasion of A549 cells
through Matrigel was significantly decreased (Figure 2D,
lower panel).
In contrast, A549 cells transfected with TM4SF4overexpressing vector, which express TM4SF4 at a
higher level than untransfected A549 cells (Figure 3A)
showed enhanced cell growth and radiation resistance
when compared by colony-forming assay (Figure 3B).
The rates of wound closure (Figure 3C) and transwell
migration (Figure 3D, upper panel) were also increased
by overexpression of TM4SF4. Finally, Matrigel assay
with TM4SF4-overexpressing cells showed again that
TM4SF4 expression is closely involved in cell invasive

ability (Figure 3D, lower panel).

TM4SF4 is involved in activation of PI3K, AKT,
NF-kappaB, and IGF1R.
Overexpression of TM4SF4 in the invasive A549
NSCLC adenocarcinoma cell line, and its effects on the
cellular characteristics of lung carcinoma cells, revealed
that TM4SF4 is critical for tumorigenesis and radiation
resistance in A549 NSCLC cells. Calu-3, which is
another NSCLC cell possessing the hypomethylated CpG
islands of TM4SF4 gene (Figure 1D), also overexpressed
TM4SF4 (Figure 1A) and showed similar patterns of
cell growth and radiation resistance as A549 cells when
expression of TM4SF4 was suppressed or overexpressed
(Supplementary Figure 1A).
To investigate the mechanism of TM4SF4mediated cell signaling related to tumorigenicity of
A549 cells, activations of the PI3K/AKT, NF-kappaB,

and ERK signaling pathways, which are involved in cell
growth, radiation resistance, migration, and invasion
were analyzed. As shown in Figure 4A, suppression of
TM4SF4 inhibited activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway.
Phosphorylation of AKT and PI3K was severely inhibited,
although total levels of AKT and PI3K were not affected.
In these cells, PTEN, a phosphatase involved in inhibition
of AKT signaling [26], was elevated in correlation with
TM4SF4 expression level. Phosphorylation of NF-kappaB
was also decreased without an increase in its expression
level. However, ERK phosphorylation was not influenced
by TM4SF4 expression level. In contrast, overexpression

of TM4SF4 elevated phosphorylation of AKT, PI3K,
and NF-kappaB. PTEN expression was also completely
suppressed by TM4SF4 overexpression. Matrix
metalloproteases (MMPs), which are involved in cell
migration and invasion, were also analyzed (Figure 4B).
MMP-2, 7, and 9 were reduced in TM4SF4-knockdown
cells and increased in TM4SF4-overexpressing cells,
which is consistent with the effect of TM4SF4 on cellular
migration and invasion.
There are several upstream factors which control
activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In lung cancer
cells, IGF1R and EGFR signaling play key roles and

have been suggested as major factors upstream of the
PI3K/AKT pathway. Phosphorylation of EGFR in A549
cells was inhibited by TM4SF4 knockdown and slightly
increased by TM4SF4 overexpression; however, TM4SF4
knockdown severely inhibited phosphorylation of IGF1R
(Figure 4C). Overexpression of TM4SF4 also significantly
increased the level of phosphorylated IGF1R. These
results suggest that TM4SF4 reinforces tumorigenicity of
lung cancer cells primarily through the IGF1R signaling
pathway.

Most members of TM4SF family mediate signal
transduction events related to the regulation of cell
development, activation, growth, and motility and these
effects have been investigated primarily in the context of
their cooperation with integrin signaling within the plasma
membrane [27]. TM4SF family proteins also mediate
signal transduction events by regulating the expression

of growth factors and their receptors [28]. TM4SF4
expression is also related to the expression of several
growth factors and receptors, such as TNF-alpha, TNFR1,
and c-Met in liver cells [18]. Activation of IGF1R which is
essential for the initiation and progression of many cancers
[29, 30] starts by ligand-initiated kinase activation with
IGF1 or IGF2. Both types of IGF are synthesized in many
fetal and adult tissues and secreted IGFs act in autocrine or
paracrine manner. However, most of extracellular IGFs are
complexed with IGFBP-3, the most prevalent extracellular
IGF binding protein, which indicate that free IGFs in
serum is important for the activation of IGF1R [31-36].
To examine the mechanism of IGF1R activation in
TM4SF4-overexpressing A549 cells, we first analyzed the
expression level of each component in the IGF1R pathway.
As shown in Figure 4C, levels of IGF1R and EGFR
were not influenced by knockdown or overexpression of
TM4SF4. The transcripts of their specific ligands (IGF1
and IGF2) and their regulatory component (IGFBP-3)
were also analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in Figure
5A, expression of IGF2 and IGFBP3 was not altered by

knockdown or overexpression of TM4SF4. The expression
of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which was analyzed
as a growth factor unrelated to the IGF1R signaling
pathway, was also unaltered. In contrast, IGF1 expression
was decreased or increased about 20-fold, depending on
the expression of TM4SF4. These results suggest that
IGF1R activation mediated by TM4SF4 overexpression
in A549 cells may be the result of regulation of IGF1
expression, specifically, the concentration of free
extracellular IGF1. Interaction between TM4SF4 and
IGF1R on the plasma membrane was also investigated by
co-immunoprecipitation using anti-IGF1R antibody, as
in our previous study of IGF1R activation by transgelin
[37]; however, direct association of TM4SF4 and IGF1R
was not observed (data not shown). In addition, IL1beta
expression, which is known to facilitate metastasis of lung
cancer [38], was also altered depending on the level of
TM4SF4.
TM4SF4 is a membrane protein which can be easily
targeted by specific antibody. We examined next whether
antibody-mediated inactivation of TM4SF4 suppresses

tumor cell growth or the expression of growth factors.
Cells were treated with anti-TM4SF4 antibody (1~3μg/
mL) and colony-forming units were assessed. As shown
in Figure 5B, antibody treatment greatly suppressed
colony formation by A549 cells. In these cells, levels of
IGF1 and IL1beta transcripts were also decreased, which
might cause the decrease in cell growth. Correlation
between the decrease of IGF1 and cell growth was also
confirmed by colony formation assay of IGF1-knockdown
A549 cells (Figure 5C). When TM4SF4-overexpressing
Calu-3 cells were treated with anti-TM4SF4 antibody or
anti-IGF1 antibody colony formation was reduced also
(Supplementary Data 1B).
As shown in Figure 4, overexpression of TM4SF4
activated PI3K, AKT, NF-kappaB, and IGF1R in A549

cells. To confirm signaling molecules related to TM4SF4mediated induction of IGF1 and IL1beta, TM4SF4overexpressing A549 cells were treated with the specific
inhibitors AG1024 (inhibits IGF1R), LY294002 (inhibits
PI3K), SN50 (inhibits NF-kappaB nuclear translocation),
and the expression patterns of IGF1 and IL1beta were
examined by RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 5D, AG1024
inhibited the expression of IGF1 and IL1beta. Inhibition
of PI3K or NF-kappaB also almost completely suppressed
the expression of IGF1 and IL1beta, which indicates that
TM4SF4-mediated induction of IGF1 requires IGF1R
mediated PI3K activation and nuclear translocation of
NF-kappaB.

inhibited the growth of xenograft tumors.

antibody was injected peritumorally at six time points
after tumor injection, and the control group, in which
vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) was injected.
As shown in Figure 7A, treatment with anti-TM4SF4
antibody almost completely eliminated the growth of
the xenograft tumors, compared with the control group.
Without antibody treatment, tumor burdens increased up to
2,500 mm3 49 days after injection of tumor cells; however
tumor volume in the anti-TM4SF4 antibody-treated
group was less than 100 mm3. In addition, anti-TM4SF4
antibody treatment enhanced radiation sensitivity of lung
cancer cells. As shown in Figure 7B, gamma irradiation
suppressed survival of A549 cells to about 50% that of
untreated cells, and treatment with anti-TM4SF4 antibody
also effectively suppressed the survival of A549 cells.
However, treatment of gamma-irradiated cells with antiTM4SF4 antibody more severely decreased the tumor cell
survival. More importantly, we confirmed that repetitive
radiation on A549 lung cancer cells increased the
expression of TM4SF4 (Figure 7C). Overall, these results
suggest that TM4SF4 is a key protein conferring radiation
resistance in lung adenocarcinoma and a combination
therapy employing radiation and targeting TM4SF4
might be effective therapy against radiation-resistant lung
adenocarcinoma.

We analyzed TM4SF4 levels in A549 NSCLC cells
and identified TM4SF4 as an inducer of lung cancer cell
tumorigenicity. Moreover, treatment with anti-TM4SF4
antibody was an effective method for suppressing the
growth of TM4SF4-overexpressing A549 cells. To
evaluate the importance of TM4SF4 in human lung
cancer and its potential as a therapeutic target, TM4SF4
expression in lung cancer tissue was confirmed by
immunohistochemical staining. As shown in Figure 6, lung
adenocarcinoma tissues (A1~A6) were stained dominantly
compared to non-neoplastic tissues (N1~N3); however,
large cell carcinoma tissues (L1~L4) were not stained.
These results suggest that TM4SF4 expression is related
to lung adenocarcinoma and it can be used as a biomarker
as well as a therapeutic target of lung adenocarcinoma.
The therapeutic efficacy of anti-TM4SF4 antibody
was evaluated in mouse xenograft models of TM4SF4overexpressing human lung adenocarcinomas. When
athymic BALB/c nude mice were subcutaneously
inoculated with TM4SF4-overexpressing A549 human
lung cancer cells, visible tumors were usually detectable
18 days later (Figure 7A). Inoculated mice were divided
into two groups, one group in which anti-TM4SF4

DISCUSSION

TM4SF4 in lung cancer cells increased phosphorylation
of IGF1R and activated signaling components of the PI3K
pathway, the most important signaling pathway in lung
cancer cells, including PI3K, AKT, and NK-kappaB. In
these lung cancer cells, TM4SF4 overexpression increased
the expression of IGF1, a ligand that activates IGF1R,
which appears to be a key event in activation of the IGF1R
pathway. Suppression of PTEN, an inhibitory phosphatase
of the AKT signaling pathway, also enhances activation
of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in TM4SF4overexpressing lung cells.

In this study, we demonstrated that TM4SF4
is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma cells as a
result of hypomethylation in the promoter region of the
TM4SF4 gene, and it enhances activation of the IGF1R
pathway and, consequently, enhances tumorigenicity.
Immunohistochemical staining of human lung cancer
tissue also confirmed that TM4SF4 is overexpressed
in lung adenocarcinoma and that it can be used as an
indicator of lung adenocarcinoma. Overexpression of

confirmed in in vitro cell-based assay. Further studies
on this combinational therapy in vivo and development
of novel targeted cancer therapy based on these results
may be valuable for treatment of patients with radiationresistant lung cancer.

However, at present it is unclear how overexpression
of TM4SF4 initiates these events. Previous studies on
other tetraspan family proteins have suggested that
tetraspanins form complexes with integrins and growth
factor receptors to create massive tetraspanin-enriched
domains that consequently function in cell adhesion,
proliferation, and motility [39, 40]. Further studies on the
function of TM4SF4 in lung cancer cells can be started
based on the interaction of TM4SF4 with other molecules,
such as integrins, growth factor receptors, and cytoplasmic
components, which might reveal the mechanism of IGF1
induction. IL1beta expression, which is known to facilitate
metastasis of lung cancer [38], is also altered depending
on the expression of TM4SF4. Although we did not
investigated further about the induction mechanism or
action of IL1beta related to tumorigenicity of TM4SF4overexpressed lung adenocarcinoma cells in this study,
NF-kappaB and PI3K signaling, key components
regulating the expression of IGF1 in A549 cells, also
regulate the expression of IL1beta as shown in results and
investigation about its action in lung cancer cells might
show another way of cancer treatment.
Tumorigenic activity of TM4SF4 in lung
adenocarcinoma cells was dramatically shown by
xenograft assay; moreover, the growth of xenograft
tumors was effectively suppressed by treatment with
anti-TM4SF4 antibody, which suggests that antiTM4SF4 antibody can be used for anti-cancer therapy
of TM4SF4-overexpressing lung adenocarcinoma. In
addition, combination treatment of anti-TM4SF4 antibody
and radiation was shown to be more effective in tumor
removal.
Approximately 50% of all cancer patients receive
some type of radiation therapy during the course of their
treatment. Patients with lung cancer are also frequently
treated with radiation therapy, and more than half of
those diagnosed with NSCLC receive radiation therapy.
Radiation is used to destroy cancer cells by damaging
DNA; however, the DNA can often be repaired, resulting
in only temporary responses to treatment. What is worse,
in some cases, is that radiation actually increases the
expression of cancer-promoting genes, such as EGFR
[41], resulting in radiation resistance. Therefore, to
overcome these situations, many efforts have been made
to increase sensitivity or efficiency of radiation therapy.
Recently, studies have shown that adding molecularly
targeted agents to radiation therapy can prevent repair
of radiation-induced damage and thereby improve the
treatment response of patients. Drugs that inhibit proteins
central to cancer growth or DNA repair, such as the EGFR
inhibitor cetuximab, can impede DNA repair and make
cancer more susceptible to radiation [41]. In this study,
we showed that TM4SF4 can be a therapeutic target in
lung cancer. In addition, we demonstrated the potential of
combination therapy of targeting TM4SF4 and radiation
against lung cancer, although at present this has been

METHODS
Cell culture
The human lung cancer cell lines A549, H460, H23,
Calu-3, H129, H2009, and H358 were obtained from the
Korea Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea) and grown in RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37°C in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.

DNA methylation analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from target cells using
the DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol
and modified by sodium bisulfite using the EZ DNA
Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as
previously described [23, 42].
Pyrosequencing of bisulfite-modified DNA was
performed to validate methylation status of candidate
loci. Primers for amplification and sequencing were 5´TGT GTT GGT GGA TTATTAATAGAG G-3´ (forward),
5´-biotin- ACA TTT ATA CAT TCT CCC TAA CCT
AA-3´ (reverse) and 5´- AGG TTA TTG GTT TTT ATG
GTA-3´ (sequencing). Primers were designed using the
Pyrosequencing (PSQ) Assay Design Program (Biotage
AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and PCR was carried out as
described previously [23]. All primers were obtained
from Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea). Pyrosequencing of PCR
products was performed using the PyroGold Reagent Kit
(Biotage AB) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Two CpG sites were analyzed and the expected sequence
was AAA YGA TTG AAT GAT TGT TTT GAA YGT AAT
(Y = T or C, i.e., methylation positions). The methylation
percentage at individual CpG sites was then analyzed
using the Pyro Q-CpG software (Biotage AB) and the
methylation percentage of TM4SF4 was calculated by
averaging the methylation percentages at two CpG sites.

siRNA transfection
A549 cells (1 × 105) were transfected with 50 nM
Stealth RNAiTM targeting TM4SF4 (Invitrogen) or Stealth
RNAiTM Negative Control Medium GC (Invitrogen)
9832

Oncotarget

using Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen).
Cells were incubated for 72 h after transfection and then
harvested for RT-PCR or western blot analyses. The
sequences of Stealth RNAiTM for targeting the TM4SF4
gene were as follows: sense, 5´-gcc ucu caa ugu ggu ucc
cug gaa u-3´ and antisense, 5´-auu cca ggg aac cac auu gag

standard deviation were plotted.

Migration assay
Untransfected control A549 cells or A549 cells 48
h after transfection with pcTM4SF4 or TM4SF4-specific
siRNA were analyzed in a transwell migration assay. In
brief, the lower culture chamber of a 24-transwell plate
(Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA, USA) was filled with 500
μL migration medium, consisting of RPMI 1640 and 10%
FBS. Cells were seeded in the upper chamber, at a density
of 2 × 105 cells in 300 µl serum-free medium/well, and
incubated for 24 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2. Non-migratory cells in the upper chamber were
removed by wiping with a cotton swab. Migratory cells on
the bottom of chambers were stained with crystal violet,
and cells were counted under a light microscope.

Construction and transfection of TM4SF4
overexpression vector
Poly(A) mRNA was isolated from A549 cells, and
a 626-bp insert of human TM4SF4 mRNA was amplified
by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using the following
primers: EcoRI/forward, 5´- CCA CGA ATT CAT GTG
CAC TGG GGG C -3´ and XhoI/reverse, 5´- TCC TCG
AGT TAA ACG GGT CCA TCT CCC -3´. TM4SF4 cDNA
inserts were cloned into the mammalian expression vector
pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and the resultant expression
vector (pcTM4SF4) was transfected into A549 cells using
Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen).

Invasion assay
Cell invasion was determined using Matrigel-coated
invasion chambers (8-µm pores; BD Biosciences, Bedford,
MA, USA) according to the manufacturer´s instructions.
Untransfected control A549 cells or A549 cells 48 h after
transfection with pcTM4SF4 or TM4SF4-specific siRNA
were incubated for 24 h in serum-free RPMI 1640 and
then detached from the cell culture plates using a nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA). Cells were resuspended in serum-free
RPMI 1640, placed in the upper invasion chamber at a
density of 5 × 104 cells/well, and RPMI 1640 containing
10% (v/v) FBS was added to the lower chamber. The
plates were incubated in a at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 24 h, and noninvasive cells in
the upper chamber were removed by wiping with a cotton
swab. The invasive cells in the underside of inserts were
fixed with 4% (w/v) formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered
saline and stained with 2% (w/v) crystal violet in 2% (v/v)
ethanol. The stained cells that had penetrated the Matrigel
were counted under a light microscope.

Colony-forming assay
Cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes at a
density of 2 × 103 cells per plate, incubated for 10 days,
and stained with 0.5% crystal violet. Colonies, defined
as groups of ≥50 cells, were then counted and relative
colony-forming percentage was plotted. For gammairradiation, cells were cultured in T25 flasks at a density of
1 × 106 cells/flask and, after 24 h, irradiated by exposure to
a single dose of 20 Gy (60Co gamma ray source; dose rate,
2 Gy/min). Then the cells were plated for colony-forming
assay. To inactivate TM4SF4 on the surface of A549 cells,
anti-TM4SF4 antibody was added to medium used for the
colony-forming assay at concentration of 1 or 3 µg/ml.

Wound-healing assay

cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification

A549 cells were transfected with TM4SF4-specific
siRNA or TM4SF4 overexpression vector. After 72 h,
cells were re-plated in 35-mm culture dishes and cultured
until the monolayer was 100% confluent. Cells were then
serum-starved overnight by incubation in RPMI 1640
medium containing 0.5% FBS, followed by introduction
of a scratch wound with a plastic pipette tip. Medium
was replaced with fresh growth medium, and images
were taken at regular intervals over the course of 12–36
h. Quantification of cell migration was carried out by
measuring the distances between 10 randomly selected
points within the wound edge and the mean values with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Total RNA was isolated from cells with TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. First-strand cDNA was generated from 1 µg
of total RNA using oligo dT primers and a cDNA synthesis
kit (Intron Biotechnology, Gyungki-do, Korea). Resultant
cDNA served as templates for PCR amplification with
the following primers: TM4SF4 forward, 5’-CCA CGA
ATT CAT GTG CAC TGG GGG C-3’ and reverse, 5’TCC TCG AGT TAA ACG GGT CCA TCT CCC-3’;
beta-actin forward, 5’-CAT CCT CAC CCT GAA GTA

denaturation at 94°C for 5 min; followed by 30 cycles
of 94°C for 1 min, 59°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min;
and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The amplified
PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels (Intron
Biotechnology) and stained with ethidium bromide.

grafts were removed and photographed. To evaluate the
antitumor efficacy of anti-TM4SF4 antibody treatment
on lung cancer, two groups of xenograft tumor mice
inoculated with TM4SF4-overexpressing A549 cells were
prepared and anti-TM4SF4 antibody (7 µg/18 g body
weight) was injected into the tumor inoculation site at six
time points (19, 21, 23, 26, 28, and 30 d after tumor cell
injection) after the tumor burdens became measurable.
The control group was injected with PBS. Tumor size was
measured at 3-day intervals; 6 weeks after inoculation,
the grafts were removed and photographed. All animal
studies were approved by the institutional review board
(KRIBB Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee/
KRIBB-IACUC, approval number: KRIBB-AEC-4253),
and all procedures were performed in accordance with
institutional guidelines for animal care.

Western blot analysis
Anti-TM4SF4 antibody for western blot analysis
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies against
phospho-Ser473 AKT, AKT, phospho-ERK, ERK,
phospho-NF-kappaB (p65), NF-kappaB, phospho-PI3K,
PI3K, PTEN, phospho-Tyr1068 EGFR, EGFR, phosphoIGF1R beta (Tyr1131)/insulin receptor beta (Tyr1146),
IGF-1R beta (111A9), and anti-beta-actin antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA, USA). Anti-MMP-2, anti-MMP-7, and anti-MMP-9
antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Western blot analysis was
performed as described previously [37]. Antibodies
against N-cadherin and E-cadherin were purchased from
BD Biosciences.

Immunohistochemistry
Lung cancer tissue sections (AccuMax Array; ISU
ABXIS Co, Seongnam, Gyeonggi, Korea) were heated
at 60°C for 30  min. Sections were deparaffinized and
rehydrated by incubation in three changes of xylene (3 min
each), three changes of 100% ethanol (2 min each), 95%
ethanol for 2 min, 85% ethanol for 2 min, 75 % ethanol
for 2 min, and two changes of distilled water. For antigen
retrieval, sections were incubated in 0.3  % hydrogen
peroxide at room temperature for 30 min to inactivate
endogenous peroxidase, followed by three washes in
PBS. Tissue sections were incubated with anti-TM4SF4
polyclonal antibody (1:100; Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature. For a negative control, the
primary antibody was replaced with PBS. After three
washes with PBS, sections were incubated with secondary
reagent (Vectastain ABC Immunohistochemistry Kit for
rabbit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).

Xenograft tumor growth assay
Tumorigenicity
of
TM4SF4-overexpressing
cells was estimated by xenograft assay. A549 cells
(5 × 105 cells per injection) overexpressing TM4SF4
were resuspended in 100 µL PBS and subcutaneously
inoculated into the flanks of 5-week old athymic BALB/c
female nude mice (n=5 per group). At 3-day intervals
after tumor cell injection, tumor size was measured using
calipers (calculated volume=shortest diameter2×longest
diameter/2). Seven weeks after cell inoculation, the
