Abstract
Activation of the transcription factor PPARg by the n-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is implicated in
controlling proinﬂammatory cytokine secretion, but the intracellular signaling pathways engaged by PPARg are
incompletely characterized. Here, we identify the adapter-encoding gene SOCS3 as a critical transcriptional target
of PPARg. SOCS3 promoter binding and gene transactivation by PPARg was associated with a repression in
differentiation of proinﬂammatory T-helper (TH)17 cells. Accordingly, TH17 cells induced in vitro displayed
increased SOCS3 expression and diminished capacity to produce interleukin (IL)-17 following activation of
PPARg by DHA. Furthermore, na€ve CD4 T cells derived from mice fed a DHA-enriched diet displayed less
capability to differentiate into TH17 cells. In two different mouse models of cancer, DHA prevented tumor
outgrowth and angiogenesis in an IL-17–dependent manner. Altogether, our results uncover a novel molecular
pathway by which PPARg-induced SOCS3 expression prevents IL-17–mediated cancer growth. Cancer Res; 73(12);

Introduction
Inﬂammation plays contrasting roles during cancer progression. Acute inﬂammation can be beneﬁcial for cancer
regression as shown by the requirement of HMGB1 and
interleukin (IL)-1b for the induction of CD8 T-cell polarization
and anticancer immune responses (1, 2). In contrast, proinﬂammatory mediators can support growth of established
cancers by supporting an inﬂammatory milieu within the
tumor microenvironment that favors tumor cell survival and
neoangiogenesis (3). IL-17–producing CD4 T cells [T-helper
(TH)17 cells] have recently emerged as a key T-cell subset that
produces proinﬂammatory mediators such as IL-17A, IL-17F,

IL-21, and TNF-a and promotes autoimmunity (4). TH17 cells
can be induced from na€ve T cells using stimulation with TGFb and IL-6 and are characterized by the expression of their
lineage-speciﬁc transcription factor RORgt (5). Although Rorc
is indispensable for TH17 cell induction, STAT3 is also an
essential transcription factor for TH17 cell differentiation as
it directly regulates il17a/f and Rorc gene transcription (6, 7).
IL-17 secretion from TH17 cells has been proposed to contribute to tumor progression through the promotion of tumor
neoangiogenesis (8).
The beneﬁcial anti-inﬂammatory properties of dietary
intake of (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were initially illustrated by epidemiologic studies reporting a lower
incidence of cardiovascular diseases in Eskimos compared
with Western populations (9, 10). Administration of the n-3
PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was later shown to dampen proinﬂammatory mediator secretion in patients with cancer (11). Activation of the transcription factor PPARg has been
proposed to account for the ability of DHA to prevent proinﬂammatory cytokine release (12).
Although DHA anticancer efﬁcacy has been reported in
preclinical mouse models of established tumors (13), whether
the anticancer activity of DHA relies on its ability to modulate
the production of proinﬂammatory cytokines remains elusive.
Here, we report that activation of the PPARg transcription
factor by DHA in developing TH17 cells induces Socs3 expression and interferes with the STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby
inhibiting TH17 cell differentiation. In addition, DHA prevents
in vivo tumor growth of B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 mammary
adenocarcinoma tumors in an IL-17–dependent manner.
Altogether, not only our study shows that DHA administration prevents tumor angiogenesis and growth in an IL-17–

dependent manner, but it also uncovers a previously unrecognized molecular pathway by which PPARg-induced SOCS3
expression in TH17 cells prevents IL-17 secretion.

Materials and Methods
Mouse strains
All animals were bred and maintained according to both
the Federation of Laboratory Animal Science Associations
(FELASA) and the Animal Experimental Ethics Committee
Guidelines (University of Burgundy, Dijon, France). Animals
were used between 6 and 22 weeks of age. Female C57BL/6,
BALB/c and Nude mice were purchased from Centre d'elevage
Janvier and from Charles River Laboratories. RORgt-eGFP
reporter mice were obtained from Dr. Eberl (Institut Pasteur,
Paris, France) and have been previously described (14). IL-17a/
mice were obtained from Dr. Y. Iwakura (University of Tokyo,
Tokyo, Japan; ref. 15). gdTCR-deﬁcient mice were kindly
provided by Dr. Bernhard Ryffel (University and CNRS,
Orleans, France). Rag2/ mice were provided by the CDTA
(Cryopreservation, Distribution, Typage et Archivage animal)
and distributed by EMMA (European Mouse Mutant Archive,
a service funded by the EC FP7 Capacities Speciﬁc Programme). PPARb- and PPARg-deﬁcient mice were provided
by Pr. Beatrice Desvergne (Centre for Integrative Genomics,
University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) and have
been described previously (16, 17).
Diets
To investigate the effect of dietary DHA in mice, we constituted 2 diet groups. One was fed a control diet containing
sunﬂower oil, and the other group of mice was fed a DHAenriched diet containing Omegavie DHA90 TG (Polaris Nutritional Lipids) for at least 3 weeks before starting experiments.
Diets were prepared as described by Triboulot and colleagues
(Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 18).
To investigate the effect of dietary DHA in 2 human healthy
volunteers (2 of the authors), 860 mg/day of DHA (Nutrixeal)
was provided as a diet supplement for 3 weeks. Na€ve CD4 Tcell differentiation into TH17 cells was then assessed.
Fatty acid analysis
Total lipids were extracted from the diets according to the
method of Bligh and Dyer (19), then transmethylated by BF3/
methanol after saponiﬁcation and fatty acids were analyzed by
gas–liquid chromatography using C15:0 as internal standard
with a Becker gas chromatograph (Becker Instruments)
equipped with a 50 m capillary glass column packed with
carbowax 20 m (Spiral-RD) as described previously (18).
Direct quantiﬁcation of nonesteriﬁed fatty acid in plasma
was conducted by a one-step method of derivatization and
extraction using (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane (Sigma) in the
presence of C15:0 as internal standard (20) with subsequent
analysis by conventional gas–liquid chromatography as described earlier.
Tumor growth experiments
B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 mammary adenocarcinoma
cancer cells were cultured at 37 C under 5% CO2 in RPMI-

www.aacrjournals.org

1640 with GlutaMax-1 (Lonza) supplemented with 10% (v/v)
fetal calf serum (Lonza), 1% penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B (Gibco), 4 mmol/L HEPES (Gibco), and 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate (Gibco). 4T1 cells were kindly provided by Dr.
Trad (Universite de Bourgogne, Dijon, France) and B16F10
cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection.
All cells were routinely tested for Mycoplasma contamination
using Mycoalert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza) and found
negative. To induce tumor formation, 3  105 B16F10 or 105
4T1 cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into Nude or
immunocompetent mice. In vivo IL-6 and IL-17 neutralization
were respectively achieved by injecting 200 mg intraperitoneally (i.p.) of an anti-IL-6 (clone MP5-20F3; BioXCell) or an antiIL-17 antibody (clone 17F3; BioXCell) on day 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6
following tumor implantation. In vivo IL-1 blockade was carried out by injecting i.p. 30 mg of IL-1 receptor antagonist
(IL-1Ra; Kineret from Biovitrum) 3 times a week. All experiments were carried out in accordance with guidelines prescribed by the Ethics Committee at the University of Burgundy.
CD31 immunostaining
Tumors were cryosliced from mouse biopsies and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were probed
with a rat monoclonal against CD31 (BD Biosciences—
Pharmingen) followed by a secondary antibody coupled to
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and counterstained with Harris's hematoxylin.
In vitro T-cell differentiation
Na€ve CD4þ T cells (CD4þCD62LhiCD44lo) were obtained
from spleens and lymph nodes of C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) or
PPARb- or PPARg-deﬁcient mice. CD4þ T cells were puriﬁed
from spleen and lymph nodes with anti-CD4 microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotec), then were further sorted as na€ve CD4þ
CD62LhiCD44lo T cells. Isolated na€ve T cells were routinely
98% pure. Isolated na€ve CD4þ T cells were stimulated with
plate-bound antibodies against CD3 (145-2C11, 2 mg/mL;
BioXCell) and CD28 (PV-1, 2 mg/mL; BioXCell) and polarized into effector CD4þ T lymphocyte subsets with cytokines
in presence or not of DHA (Sigma-Aldrich). Mouse IL-4 (20
ng/mL), IL-6 (25 ng/mL), IL-12 (10 ng/mL), and TGF-b
(2 ng/mL) were all purchased from MiltenyiBiotec. AntiIL-4 (clone 11B11) and anti-IFN-g (clone XMG1.2; 10 mg/mL)
antibodies were obtained from Bio-XCell. In some experiments, the PPARg agonist troglitazone and the antagonist
GW9662 have been added at ﬁnal concentrations of 0.75 and
0.1 mmol/L, respectively (Cayman Chemical). The PPARa
and PPARb antagonists (GW6471 and GSK0660; SigmaAldrich) have been supplemented to reach a ﬁnal concentration of 0.24 and 0.16 mmol/L, respectively. Cells were
classically harvested on day 3 (unless otherwise speciﬁed)
for detection of cytokines by ELISA and quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.
Experiments on human CD4þ T cells were carried out using
peripheral blood from healthy volunteers (provided by the
"Etablissement Français du Sang" Besançon, France). Written
informed consent was obtained from all healthy blood donors.
Na€ve CD4þ T cells were isolated with the human CD4þ T Cell

Isolation Kit II (MiltenyiBiotec), followed by stimulation
with the Expansion/Activation Kit (MiltenyiBiotec), and differentiated for 3 days into TH0 cells without cytokines or TH17
cells in presence of TGF-b (2 ng/mL), IL-6 (10 ng/mL), and IL23 (10 ng/mL).
siRNA transfection
For transfection experiments, na€ve CD4þ T cells were
transfected in vitro with Silencer Select Predesigned siRNA
speciﬁc for murine SOCS3 (ID: s72013; Ambion, Life Technologies) or murine PPARg (ID: 160219; Ambion) or Silencer
Negative Control N 1 (Ambion) with transfection reagent
TransIT-TKO (Mirus Bio LLC) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four hours after transfection,
CD4þ T cells were restimulated with anti-CD3 and antiCD28, differentiated in TH0 or TH17 conditions as described
earlier and cultured for an additional 24 or 48 hours before
analysis.
Measurement of cytokines
After 72-hour polarization, cell culture supernatants were
assayed by ELISA for mouse IL-4 (BD Biosciences), IL-17a
(Biolegend), IFN-g (BD Biosciences), or human IL-17 (Biolegend) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were cultured for 5
days and then stimulated for 4 hours at 37 C in culture medium
containing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 50 ng/mL;
Sigma-Aldrich), ionomycin (1 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), and
monensin (GolgiStop; 1 mL/mL; BD Biosciences). After staining
for surface markers and 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) to
exclude dead cells, cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm Kit;
BD Biosciences), then stained for intracellular products. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) used for ﬂow cytometry analyses
were as follows: ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated
anti-CD4 (GK1.5; BD Biosciences), Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated
anti-IL-17 (eBio 17B7; eBiosciences), and phycoerythrin (PE)conjugated anti-IL-4 (554435; BD Biosciences) or PE-conjugated anti-IFN-g (554412; BD Biosciences).
All events were acquired by a BD LSR-II cytometer equipped
with BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and data were
analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Immunoblot analysis
Puriﬁed na€ve T cells were differentiated for 24 to 48 hours
into TH0 or TH17 cells with or without DHA (20 mmol/L), then
collected and pelleted by centrifugation (5 minutes, 1,500  g).
Cells were lysed in boiling buffer [1% SDS, 1 mmol/L sodium
orthovanadate, and 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4)] containing
protease inhibitor cocktail for 20 minutes at 4 C. Cell lysates
were subjected to sonication (10 seconds at 10%) and protein
concentration was assessed using the Bio-Rad DC Protein
Assay Kit. Proteins were then denaturated, loaded, and
separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred on nitrocellulose
membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking with 5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS–0.1% Tween 20 (TBST),
membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibody
diluted in TBST containing 1% BSA, washed and incubated

3580

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

for 1 hour with secondary antibody diluted in TBST–1% BSA.
After additional washes, membranes were incubated with
luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and exposed to
X-ray ﬁlms. The following mouse mAbs were used: anti-STAT3
(Cell Signaling Technology), anti-SOCS3 (Novus Biologicals),
and anti-b-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). The following rabbit polyclonal antibody was used: anti-phospho-STAT3-Tyr705 (Cell
Signaling Technology). Secondary antibodies HRP-conjugated
polyclonal goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and
polyclonal rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulins (Dako) were also
used.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Cells were differentiated for 24 hours into TH17 cells with
or without DHA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions
(ChiP-IT Express Enzymatic; Active Motif). Brieﬂy, cells were
ﬁxed in a solution containing 37% formaldehyde for 10 minutes
and quenched with 0.125 mol/L glycine. Chromatin was isolated and sheared to an average length of 300 to 500 bp
by Enzymatic Cocktail. Twenty-ﬁve micrograms of DNA were
immunoprecipitated with a PPARg-speciﬁc antibody (H-1000;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After chromatin elution, crosslinks were reversed by a Reverse Cross-linking Buffer and
qRT-PCR was conducted. Data were normalized to Actin-b
Ct values and expressed in fold enrichment according to
immunoglobulin (Ig) values. Primers designed to assess ChIP
assay are as follows: Actb 50 -actctttgcagccacattcc-30 and 30 -agcgtctggttcccaatact-50 ; Socs3 1679 50 -gtcgacattccttctcaggttt-30
and 50 -gcaccccttcccttttctttt-30 ; and Socs3 576 50 -cccaggtcctttgcctgatt-30 and 50 -tgagagaggggaccaggagaaa-30 .
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA from T cells was extracted with TriReagent
(Ambion), reverse transcribed using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), and was analyzed by qRT-PCR with
the SYBR Green method according to the manufacturer's
instructions using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). Expression was normalized to the
expression of mouse Actb. Primers designed to assess gene
expression are as follows: Actb 50 -atggaggggaatacagccc-30 and

Figure 3. DHA treatment impairs STAT3 phosphorylation and upregulates SOCS3 in TH17 cells. A, expression of mouse p-STAT3 in TH0- and TH17differentiated cells for 24 hours treated or not with DHA was determined by Western blotting. B, SOCS3 mRNA expression level was assessed in mouse and
human control TH17 cells or DHA-treated counterparts after 3 hours of differentiation by qRT-PCR analysis (left) and activation of mouse protein
SOCS3 was examined by immunoblotting (right) in CD4þ T cells polarized under TH0 or TH17 conditions 24 hours long in presence or not of DHA. C, CD4þ
T cells were transfected with a control siRNA (siCT) or a siRNA speciﬁc for SOCS3 (siSOCS3) for 24 hours before being differentiated for further 24 hours
into control or DHA TH17-cell driving conditions, then SOCS3 expression was determined by Western blotting (top) and Rorc mRNA induction (bottom)
monitored by qRT-PCR. D, TH17 cells were generated and transfected as in C and IL-17 release was assayed by ELISA. Representative data from
1 of 3 experiments are shown. NS, not signiﬁcant.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was conducted using Prism software
(Graph Pad software). For the analysis of experimental data,
comparison of continuous data was achieved by the Mann–
Whitney U test and comparison of categorical data by Fisher
exact test, as appropriate. All P values are two-tailed. P values
less than 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. Data are represented as mean  SD.

Results
In vivo administration of DHA impairs mouse TH17 cell
differentiation from na€ve CD4 T cells
Despite reports suggesting that DHA could dampen the
production of proinﬂammatory cytokines from innate immune
cells (21, 22), whether DHA affects na€ve CD4 T-cell differentiation in a cell-intrinsic manner has not been explored. To test
this, we ﬁrst examined the ability of na€ve CD4þ CD62Lþ T cells

A, RNA isolated from naïve CD4 CD62L cells differentiated into TH0, TH1, TH2, Treg, or TH17 cells with antiCD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence or absence of DHA (20 mmol/L) was subjected to qRT-PCR relative to the expression of mRNA-encoding
mouse Actb to examine the expression of Rorc at 72 hours following activation (left). qRT-PCR analysis of Rorc expression and ELISA of IL-17 in supernatants

B, naïve CD4þ T cells from RORgt-eGFP reporter mice were differentiated into TH17 cells for 72 hours in the presence of indicated escalating doses of DHA and
the proportion of RORgt-expressing cells was assessed by ﬂow cytometry. Numbers beside outlined areas indicate percentage cells in each gate.
C and E, TH17 cells were generated as in A and the expression of the Rora, AhR, il17f, il21, il22, and CD4 genes (C) and Tbx21, Gata3, and Foxp3 genes (E) was
assessed by qRT-PCR. D, TH17 cells were generated with or without DHA as in A, ﬁrst round, and reactivated for further 48 hours in presence of
IL-23 with an additional DHA treatment or not (second round), then the levels of IL-17 released from these cells after the second round of stimulation were
determined by ELISA. F, human TH17 cells were generated from naïve peripheral blood CD4þ T cells isolated from healthy volunteers polarized for
72 hours in vitro and treated or not with DHA, then IL-17 secreted in supernatants and Rorc mRNA level were assessed, respectively, by ELISA (left) and qRTPCR (right). G, same analyses as in F but carried out from differentiated TH17 cells generated before or after a 3-week long DHA supplementation diet.

isolated from mice fed a control or DHA-enriched diet for 3
weeks to differentiate into effector T-cell subsets following
activation in absence of antigen-presenting cells. DHAenriched diet led to accumulation of DHA within splenocytes
as previously described (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 18). Upon
examining T-cell polarization, DHA failed to signiﬁcantly alter
the expression of the transcription factors Tbx21, Gata3, and
Foxp3 that respectively specify the TH1, TH2, and regulatory
T cell (Treg) lineages (Fig. 1A). However, na€ve CD4þ T cells
isolated from mice under a DHA-enriched diet featured a
poor capacity to differentiate into TH17 cells under TH17polarizing conditions, as illustrated by their weak expression
of the TH17-cell transcription factor Rorc (Fig. 1B). By
assessing IL-17a secretion from TH17 cells generated from
mice under a DHA-enriched diet by ELISA, we found reduced
IL-17a secretion in comparison with controls, whereas IFN-g
or IL-4 production from TH1 and TH2 cells were not affected
(Fig. 1C). Intracellular staining data conﬁrmed dampened
IL-17a secretion from TH17 cells from mice receiving DHA in
vivo, whereas the respective production of IFN-g or IL-4 from
TH1 and TH2 cells remained unaffected (Fig. 1D). Overall,
these results suggest that DHA selectively affects TH17 cell
differentiation in vivo.
DHA inhibits mouse and human TH17 cell differentiation
in a cell-intrinsic manner
To test whether DHA directly affects TH17 cell development,
we differentiated na€ve CD4þ T cells without antigen-presenting
cells under TH17 cell-polarizing conditions in the presence of
DHA. We observed a marked reduction of Rorc expression in TH
17 cells upon DHA treatment, conﬁrming that DHA impairs TH
17 cell differentiation (Fig. 2A). This inhibition is speciﬁc for DHA
as other PUFAs such as eicosapentaenoic or arachidonic acids
did not impair TH17 cell differentiation (Fig. 2A). To study
further the impact of DHA on TH17 differentiation, we generated
TH17 cells from Rorgt-eGFP reporter mice with increasing doses
of DHA. DHA reduced the proportion of Rorgt-expressing cells in
a dose-dependent manner, corroborating the DHA capacity to
inhibit TH17 cell differentiation (Fig. 2B). In addition, we also
explored the ability of DHA to affect other TH17-related genes
and found that DHA impaired the expression of Rora, Ahr, i17f,
il21, and il22, suggesting that DHA globally affects the TH17 cell
differentiation program (Fig. 2C). IL-23 is essential to maintain
the proinﬂammatory TH17 cell program both in vitro and in vivo
(23). Because DHA blunted the primary differentiation of na€ve
CD4 T cells into effector TH17 cells, we explored the ability of
DHA to inﬂuence IL-23 capacity to restimulate engaged TH17

cells. We found that DHA was also able to reduce IL-17a
secretion from engaged TH17 cells restimulated with IL-23 (Fig.
2D). To test whether DHA skewed TH17 cell differentiation
toward another CD4 effector T-cell subset, we monitored the
expression of Tbx21, Gata3, and Foxp3 genes in TH17 cells treated
with DHA. We found that DHA failed to induce any of the
transcription factors deﬁning the TH1, TH2, or Treg lineages,
indicating that DHA restricts but does not skew TH17 cell
differentiation in vitro (Fig. 2E). We tested whether DHA also
affects human TH17 cell differentiation. For this, we ﬁrst differentiated na€ve human CD4þ T cells isolated from the blood of
healthy volunteers into TH17 cells in the presence of DHA. In line
with our ﬁndings with mouse T cells, we found that DHA also
prevented human TH17 cell differentiation (Fig. 2F). Similarly,
upon assessing TH17 cell induction from na€ve human CD4 T
cells obtained from healthy individuals before or after 3 weeks of
DHA intake as a diet supplement, we found that oral DHA intake
decreased TH17 cell differentiation (Fig. 2G). Altogether, these
ﬁndings indicate that DHA restrains mouse and human TH17
cell differentiation.
DHA interferes with TH17 cell differentiation by inducing
Socs3
The transcription factor STAT3 was shown to transactivate the Il17a/f and the Rorc promoters (24, 25). Because
DHA dampened IL-17a/f secretion and Rorc expression in
developing TH17 cells, we hypothesized that DHA negatively
regulates STAT3 activation during TH17 cell differentiation.
To test this, we induced TH17 cells from na€ve CD4þ T cells
in vitro in presence or absence of DHA. As expected, we
noted a robust STAT3 (p-STAT3) phosphorylation in TH17
cells generated without DHA (Fig. 3A). In contrast, CD4 T
cells incubated under TH17-polarizing conditions with DHA
featured a weak level of p-STAT3, conﬁrming that DHA
reduces STAT3 signaling in TH17 cells (Fig. 3A). Because
SOCS3 is a major regulator of STAT3 phosphorylation in TH
17 cells (24), we hypothesized that the DHA-mediated downregulation of p-STAT3 may be due to increased SOCS3
expression. We found that SOCS3 mRNA and protein expression was induced by DHA treatment in mouse and human
TH17 cells, suggesting that the DHA-mediated downregulation of TH17 cell differentiation could be related to SOCS3
induction (Fig. 3B). To investigate the involvement of SOCS3
in the capacity of DHA to control TH17 cell differentiation,
we downregulated SOCS3 expression in T cells differentiated
under TH17-cell skewing conditions with DHA using siRNA.
We found that SOCS3 silencing blunted the capacity of DHA

expression of PPARg target genes (MMP9, Cyp27, and Clu) and Gata3 as control within TH17 cells exposed or not to DHA in vitro. C, mouse TH17 cells were
differentiated as described in Materials and Methods with control or DHA in presence or absence of speciﬁc PPARs ligands (PPARs inhibitors and
troglitazone). Rorc mRNA level was monitored in these cells (left) and the amount of IL-17 secreted was quantiﬁed by ELISA (right) at 3 days following
activation. D, ELISA of IL-17 in supernatants of TH17 cells treated or not with DHA for 48 hours after transfection with control (siCT) or PPARg siRNA (siPPARg).
E, ChIP analysis of the interaction between PPARg and Socs3 promoter in in vitro differentiated TH17 cells transfected either with siCT or siPPARg after DHA
treatment or not. Analysis on the 2 putative binding sites for PPARg on Socs3 promoter (1679 and 576) is shown. F, naïve CD4þ T cells from PPARg- (top)
and PPARb (bottom)–deﬁcient mice or WT counterparts were polarized into TH0, TH17, and DHA-treated TH17 lymphocytes. At day 3 of culture, IL-17 secretion
and Rorc expression levels were monitored by ELISA and qRT-PCR, respectively. At day 5 and after restimulation, ﬂow cytometry of the intracellular
production of IL-17 by these cells in presence or not of DHA was assessed (right). Representative data from 1 of 3 experiments are shown. NS, not signiﬁcant;

to restrain IL-17 and RORgt expression in TH17 cells (Fig. 3C
and D). Collectively, our ﬁndings suggest that DHA restrains
TH17 cell differentiation by interfering with STAT3 signaling
through SOCS3 induction.
DHA prevents TH17 cell differentiation in a PPARgdependent manner
To unravel the mechanism accounting for SOCS3 induction in developing TH17 cells upon DHA treatment, we
investigated the intracellular signaling pathways engaged
by DHA on TH17 cells. GPR120 was recently identiﬁed as an
omega-3 fatty acid receptor (26). To test the involvement of
GPR120 in the DHA-driven impairment of TH17 cell differentiation, we downregulated GPR120 expression with siRNA

3586

in na€ve T cells and analyzed the effect of DHA during TH17
differentiation. Our results showed no signiﬁcant differences
in TH17 polarization between cells transfected with control
or GPR120 siRNA, indicating that the decreased TH17 cell
induction upon DHA treatment does not depend on GPR120
(Fig. 4A). PPARg is another proposed receptor for omega-3
fatty acid. Synthetic PPARg ligands have been reported to
induce Socs3 expression and inhibit STAT3 activation (27).
Given that DHA interfered with TH17 cell differentiation
through STAT3 signaling pathway blockade, we hypothesized that the effects of DHA on TH17 cells relied on the
transcription factor PPARg. Gene expression analysis
revealed that the known PPARg target genes MMP9, Cyp27,
and Clu were induced in DHA-treated TH17 cells, suggesting

that PPARg signaling is activated by DHA treatment on TH17
cells (Fig. 4B). In addition, the DHA effect on TH17 cell
differentiation was markedly reduced in the presence of a
PPARg inhibitor GW9662, but not with a PPARb inhibitor
GSK0660 or PPARa inhibitor GW6471, as measured by IL-17
secretion and Rorc expression (Fig. 4C). Moreover, PPARg
agonist troglitazone neutralized IL-17 secretion from TH17
cells to a comparable extent to DHA, suggesting that PPARg
activation is involved in DHA effects on TH17 cells (Fig. 4C).
To validate the elective involvement of PPARg in the intracellular effects of DHA on TH17 cells, we downregulated
PPARg expression with siRNA and tested the ability of DHA
to inhibit TH17 cell differentiation in absence of PPARg. We

found that silencing PPARg completely abolished the ability
of DHA to restrain TH17 cell induction (Fig. 4D). Although
PPARg agonists induce Socs3 expression (27, 28), the direct
link between PPARg and SOCS3 remains unclear. To test
whether the DHA-driven Socs3 induction is directly due to
PPARg activation, we conducted a bioinformatic analysis of
the Socs3 promoter and found 2 putative binding sites for
PPARg at positions 1679 and 576 from the transcription
start site. By conducting ChIP, we found that PPARg binds to
the Socs3 promoter only at position 576 in DHA-treated TH
17 cells as compared with control TH17 cells (Fig. 4E). We
further checked the speciﬁcity of this interaction by downregulating PPARg expression by siRNA and conﬁrmed that

the amount of PPARg-binding Socs3 promoter was accordingly reduced (Fig. 4E). Finally, we tested the effects of DHA
on na€ve T cells from WT-, PPARg-, or PPARb-deﬁcient mice.
In line with our results obtained with the PPAR inhibitors,
we found that while DHA could suppress TH17 cell differentiation from WT- and PPARb-deﬁcient T cells, PPARgdeﬁcient T cells were totally unaffected by DHA treatment
(Fig. 4F). Altogether, these ﬁndings show that the ability of
DHA to hamper TH17 cell differentiation is strictly dependent on PPARg-dependent Socs3 expression.

vasculature reﬂected by reduced vegfr and vegf expression and
reduced number of CD31-positive blood vessels (Fig. 6D).
Finally, to determine the role of VEGF in the antitumor effect
of DHA, we treated tumor-bearing mice fed or not a DHAenriched diet with the VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-blocking mAb,
DC101. We observed that while DHA and anti-VEGF therapy
exhibited similar antitumor effects, these treatments failed to
synergize (Fig. 6E). Collectively, these data suggest that the
activity of DHA relies on the prevention of IL-17–dependent
tumor neoangiogenesis.

DHA prevents tumor growth in vivo in an IL-17–
dependent manner
Although DHA was proposed to promote cancer cell death
(29), we found that DHA did not exert direct cytotoxic effects
on mouse melanoma B16F10 and in 4T1 mammary adenocarcinoma tumor cells in vitro at concentrations that could be
reached in vivo (60 mmol/L; Fig. 5A). However, we noted that
the DHA-enriched diet delays subcutaneous tumor growth in
vivo in both cancer models (Fig. 5B). In contrast, DHA did not
show any antitumor efﬁcacy in nude mice in both models
suggesting that DHA mediates its anticancer function through
T cells (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S3). Given that DHA
impedes proinﬂammatory cytokine release, which has been
proposed to contribute to B16F10 and 4T1 tumor growth
(8, 30–32), we tested whether DHA affected tumor growth in
vivo in these 2 tumor models by affecting IL-1, IL-6, or IL-17
release. DHA still exhibited in vivo anticancer activity against
B16F10 tumors in absence of IL-1 and IL-6 (Supplementary Fig.
S4). However, DHA failed to exhibit any effect on tumor
progression in IL-17a/ mice, suggesting that the anticancer
effects of DHA are dependent on IL-17 (Fig. 5D). These results
were conﬁrmed by neutralizing IL-17 in vivo in the 4T1 tumor
model (Fig. 5D). As a control, IL-17 mAb did not exert any direct
cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, ruling out any direct effect of IL17 on tumor cell growth (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Because gd T cells and TH17 cells are major IL-17 sources in
vivo, we investigated whether DHA anticancer efﬁcacy relied
on gd T cells and IL-17–producing CD4 T cells. We found that
the DHA-enriched diet could prevent tumor growth in gdTCRdeﬁcient mice, ruling out any signiﬁcant contribution of these
cells in DHA anticancer activity (Fig. 6A). However, upon
testing DHA antitumor effect in T-cell–deﬁcient Rag2/ mice
reconstituted with either IL-17þ/þ or IL-17/ ab CD4 T cells,
we failed to note any therapeutic beneﬁt of the DHA diet in
mice that had received IL-17–deﬁcient CD4 T cells (Fig. 6B). We
also measured TH17 cell responses from WT mice under the
control or DHA-enriched diet. In line with our previous ﬁndings, draining lymph node CD4 T cells from B16F10 tumorbearing mice under the DHA-enriched diet expressed lower
amounts of IL-17 and Rorc than controls (Fig. 6C). Together
these data suggest that DHA may affect tumor growth via this
capacity to regulate IL-17 secretion from TH17 cells.
IL-17A is a proangiogenic factor that favors neovascularization and tumor growth in vivo via its capacity to induce VEGF
production (8, 33). In line with the documented angiogenic
properties of IL-17A, we noted that B16F10 tumors from
mice under DHA-enriched diet featured decreased tumor

Discussion

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

Although activation of the transcription factor PPARg has
been associated with reduced inﬂammation, the intracellular
series of events consecutive to PPARg activation remain
incompletely understood and the actual involvement of PPARg
in the anti-inﬂammatory effects of PPARg ligands remains
debated (34, 35). In this study, we propose what we believe to be
a novel molecular pathway by which PPARg contributes to
limit the secretion of the proinﬂammatory cytokine IL-17. DHA
activates PPARg, which binds to the Socs3 promoter and drives
Socs3 expression in nascent TH17 cells, leading to reduced
STAT3 phosphorylation, Rorc expression and IL-17 secretion.
Finally, DHA prevents tumor growth in vivo through the downregulation of IL-17 production.
Although our data indicate that DHA inhibits TH17 cell
induction through downregulating the STAT3 signaling pathway, the strong inhibitory effect of DHA on TH17 cell differentiation suggests that DHA could act at several levels on the TH17
cell differentiation program. Indeed, activation of PPARg has
been shown to prevent the clearance of corepressors from the
Rorgt promoter (36), resulting in repressed TH17 cell generation. We cannot rule out that this signaling pathway plays an
additional role in DHA effect on differentiating TH17 cells.
The links between inﬂammation and cancer have been
thoroughly documented as illustrated by data showing an
increased risk of patients suffering from inﬂammatory bowel
disease to develop cancer compared with healthy individuals
(37). Chronic inﬂammation can indeed contribute to cell
transformation and cancer formation. Dietary supplementation of DHA has been shown to alleviate the severity of
intestinal inﬂammation (38, 39) in experimental models of
colitis and in inﬂammatory bowel disease in humans (40, 41).
These ﬁndings possibly explain why dietary (n-3) PUFAs intake
was associated with decreased risk of cancer (42, 43). However,
recent data indicate that DHA also improves outcome of
chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer, suggesting that it not only affects cancer incidence, but can be
therapeutically used to prevent tumor growth (44). Our study
brings up evidence that the anticancer effects of DHA could
rely on its ability to dampen IL-17 levels in vivo.
The role of TH17 cells during cancer growth remains intensely debated. Adoptive transfer experiments have shown the
anticancer potential of both mouse and human TH17 cells
(45, 46). It was further shown recently that the remarkable
ability of TH17 cells to eliminate tumors in these settings relied
on their ability to self-renew and transdifferentiate into IFNg–producing cells in vivo (46). However, in some human

Socs3 Induction by PPARg Limits IL-17 Secretion

cancers IL-17 was shown to be associated with poor prognosis (47–49). Mouse and human studies revealed an association between IL-17 levels in the tumor bed, VEGF, and
blood vessels number (33, 50). In addition, IL-17 has the
capacity to directly trigger VEGF release from VEGFR-expressing cells such as cancer cells and stromal cells (33). These
data support the contention that IL-17 is an important factor, which drives VEGF-dependent neoangiogenesis during
cancer growth. Anti-VEGF therapies are being implemented
for cancer treatment in humans but are expensive. In this
regard, our study supports the antiangiogenic property of a
DHA-enriched diet via its capacity to regulate IL-17 production and VEGF-related angiogenesis. If such results could be
conﬁrmed in patients with cancer, DHA should be considered as a potential antiangiogenic candidate for future clinical
trials.
Altogether, our study unraveled that DHA-mediated PPARg
activation limits TH17 cell differentiation by inducing SOCS3
expression. Because our results suggest that the activity of
DHA is relevant in humans, DHA administration might
prove beneﬁcial in diseases where IL-17 cytokine secretion is
undesirable.
