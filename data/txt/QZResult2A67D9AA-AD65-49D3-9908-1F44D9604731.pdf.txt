BACKGROUND: Since 1996, 6 new drugs have been introduced for the treatment of metastatic colorectal
cancer. Although they are promising, these drugs frequently are given in the palliative and are much
more expensive than older treatments. The objective of the current study was to measure the cost implications of treatment with sequential regimens that include chemotherapy and/or monoclonal antibodies.
METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients with newly diagnosed, metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients supposedly received up to 3 lines of treatment before supportive care and subsequent death. Data were obtained from published, multicenter phase 2 and
randomized phase 3 clinical trials. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the efficacy, toxicity, and cost.
RESULTS: Using drug costs alone, treatment that included new chemotherapeutic agents increased survival
at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $100,000 per discounted life-year (DLY). The addition
of monoclonal antibodies improved survival at an ICER of >$170,000 per DLY. The results were most sensitive to changes in the initial regimen. Even with significant improvements in clinical characteristics (efficacy
and toxicity), treatment with the most effective regimens still had very high ICERs. CONCLUSIONS:
Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with the most effective regimens came at very high incremental
costs. The authors concluded that cost-effectiveness analyses should be a routine component of the drugdevelopment process, so that physicians and patients are informed appropriately regarding the value of

KEY WORDS: cost-effectiveness, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, monoclonal antibodies, Monte Carlo
simulation, metastatic colorectal cancer, palliative chemotherapy.

The treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer has changed dramatically in the last decade. Introduced in
the 1950s, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was the first drug available for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.
Overall survival remained at approximately 1 year despite biomodulation with leucovorin (LV). Irinotecan
was approved in 1996, and oxaliplatin was approved in 2000. In 2004, the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and bevacizumab were introduced for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Panitumumab gained
approval in late 2006 for patients who had failed chemotherapy. With these new agents, there has been a
paradigm shift in the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a doubling of median
survival over 5-FU alone and a potential for long-term survival in a significant minority of patients.1

Unfortunately, the vast majority of such patients are
not cured, and each new drug offers only modest survival
benefits. Irinotecan increased median overall survival by
2.2 months when added to the combination of 5-FU and
LV.2 Oxaliplatin, when given in combination with infusional 5-FU and LV (FOLFOX), improved median overall survival by 4.4 months compared with irinotecan,
bolus 5-FU, and LV (IFL).3 Bevacizumab received US
Food and Drug Administration approval based on a 4.7month improvement in survival when added to IFL.4
Cetuximab, when given alone, had a median time to progression (TTP) of 1.5 months; combining this antibody
with irinotecan increased the median TTP to 4.1
months.5 The progression-free survival (PFS) of chemotherapy-refractory patients who received panitumumab
was 8 weeks compared with 7.3 weeks in patients who
received best supportive care alone.6
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) Practice Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer recommend that patients with good tolerance for intensive
chemotherapy initially should receive 5-FU-based combination chemotherapy and bevacizumab. The guidelines
suggest additional chemotherapy and/or cetuximab or
panitumumab in the second-line and third-line settings,
ultimately exposing patients to all available classes of
agents.7
With the exception of 5-FU and irinotecan (which
recently came off patent), these drugs are very expensive,
and the cost implications of these promising medications
are the subject of significant debate.8-10 To our knowledge, there are limited data in the published literature
regarding the cost–effectiveness of treatments for patients
with metastatic colorectal cancer. Hillner et al used data
from the multicenter North Central Cancer Treatment
Group (NCCTG) study 9741 to compare treatment with
IFL versus treatment with FOLFOX and observed that
the 4.4-month median survival benefit of the FOLFOX
arm was accompanied by an incremental cost of $29,953,
resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)
of $80,410 per life-year gained.11 Starling et al examined
the role of cetuximab and irinotecan compared with best
supportive care from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Service and reported an ICER of
£42,975 per life-year gained.12 To our knowledge, there
has not been a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis
that included multiple lines of therapy.

FIGURE 1. Stylized Markov model. Patients may receive up to
3 lines of therapy. Patients also may die in any health state
from all cause mortality (not shown).

In an effort to characterize the cost of modern treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, we developed a
model that measures the added benefits and costs of sequential combination regimens. Rather than performing a
direct comparison of specific agents or regimens, our
model evaluates broad categories of therapies, such as antibody-containing regimens versus nonantibody-containing regimens, and treatment strategies that include 1, 2, or
3 lines of therapy to gain a better understanding of the
cost implications of the changing paradigm of metastatic
colorectal cancer treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Model
We used TreeAge Pro 2006 to develop a Markov model
(Fig. 1) that could follow the natural history of patients
who were treated for metastatic colorectal cancer. In this
model, patients can be treated with 1, 2, or 3 lines of therapy before supportive care and death. Patients are evaluated at weekly intervals (Markov cycles) and can either
remain on therapy at stable doses, develop toxicity, or die.
Patients who develop toxicity will die, continue on therapy at a dose reduction, or change therapy.
Perspective
This analysis was conducted from the perspective of a
third-party payor.
Comparators
For this model, we used 9 possible treatment strategies
(Table 1). Although there are many possible other

analysis.
Data Sources
Estimates of rates of progression and toxicity were
obtained from published results of multicenter phase 2
and randomized phase 3 studies (Table 3). In addition,
we included unpublished aggregate data from NCCTG
study 9741 (FOLFOX vs IFL as first-line therapy). We restricted data to peer-reviewed publications and excluded
abstract presentations.
Progression
We used the TTP or PFS data to estimate the length of
time patients were on treatment. When >1 source was
available, we chose the source with the larger sample size.
To estimate the benefit of the addition of bevacizumab to
combined 5-FU, LV, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) or combined 5-FU, LV, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), we added
4.4 months (the increased TTP of IFL plus bevacizumab
compared with IFL alone)4 to the TTP of these regimens.

bevacizumab-containing regimens, which provide a
conservative estimate of treatment-related toxicity. We
assumed that patients could have up to 2 toxic events
before discontinuing treatment. We assumed that the
probability of having a second toxic event was 10%; we fit
the model using this estimate to general clinical outcomes
consistent with clinical practice and varied this figure in
sensitivity analyses (SA).

Calculations of Probability for Progression
and Toxicity
We assumed that toxicity and progression were independent and mutually exclusive events over the course of a 1week cycle. Progression rates were abstracted from trial
results and converted to weekly probabilities using the
declining exponential approximation of life expectancy
(DEALE).14,15 Toxicities were converted to probabilities
using the DEALE and fractionated into fatal and nonfatal
outcomes. After running the Markov analyses, expected
survivals expressed as means were transformed back to
median PFS/TTP intervals.

Toxicity
We used reported rates of grade 3 (severe) or grade 4 (lifethreatening) toxicity. We used toxicity rates of FOLFOX
and FOLFIRI alone as the toxicity rates for the respective

on the observation that patients who received supportive
care rather than second-line irinotecan had a median survival of 6 months.16 In addition, Starling et al estimated
that patients who received best supportive care instead of
cetuximab and irinotecan lived for 5.6 months.12 We
used a cost of $135 per day based on Medicare
reimbursement.17

Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratios
For clarity of presentation, we present Regimens A, C, G,
and I. These regimens were selected because they reflect
increasingly effective treatments: Pair 1, comparing C
with A, measures the survival advantage offered by modern chemotherapy agents (irinotecan and oxaliplatin)
compared with 5-FU/LV alone; Pair 2, comparing G with
C, measures the survival advantage offered by the addition
of antibodies to modern chemotherapy; and Pair 3, comparing I with G, represents the survival advantage offered
by the most aggressive sequence in this model.

RESULTS
Base Case

Sensitivity Analyses
We performed 1-way SAs in which we measured the
effects of changes in toxicity, progression, drug costs,
probability of second toxicity, time on supportive care,
and cost of supportive care on the overall cost effectiveness
of the model. We report the ICERs of Pairs 1, 2 and 3
described earlier. We performed a separate SA to measure
the impact of generic irinotecan (estimated to be approximately 33% the cost of brand irinotecan).13

Monte Carlo Simulation
To measure the impact of uncertainty of all variables, we
performed 2-dimensional SA using a Monte Carlo simulation. We studied 1000 hypothetical patients as they
transitioned through the model over their beta probability
distributions of toxicity and progression. To measure the
impact of lower drug prices on the cost-effectiveness
ratios, we varied the rates between 25% and 106% of ASP
on a triangular distribution.

Discounting
Life expectancy and costs were discounted 3% per year.

May 15, 2009

The cost and effectiveness for each sequence is presented
in Table 1. The cost-effectiveness frontier for the basecase scenario is presented in Figure 2. Similar sequences
that vary the order in which irinotecan and oxaliplatin are
given (Regimens F and G; Regimens H and I) have similar
life expectancies.
Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratios
The ICERS for selected sequences are shown in Table 4.
The ICER per discounted life-year (DLY) gained for adding the modern chemotherapy agents is approximately
$100,000/DLY gained. The benefits of adding antibody
come at higher costs ($170,000/DLY). The modest additional benefit of the most effective regimen in this model
(using both cetuximab and irinotecan in the third-line
setting) generate even higher costs ($240,000/DLY).
Sensitivity Analysis
The cost-effectiveness frontier using generic irinotecan
pricing is shown in Figure 3; as expected, the overall cost
of treatments that contain front-line irinotecan are lower
than those that contain front-line oxaliplatin.

In addition, we performed 1-way analyses on rates
of several key parameters for Pairs 1, 2 and 3 (Tables 5
through 8). The ‘‘base-case’’ results are shaded in the
tables, with lower and higher rates of each variable on the
left and right, respectively. These results demonstrated
that, despite improvements in the clinical parameters
(toxicity and progression), cost, and length of supportive
care, the ICERs for the antibody-containing sequences
(Regimens G and I) are very high. The most significant
changes in the ICERs occurred when the parameters for
first-line treatment were changed. Because we chose to
focus on the pair-wise comparison of treatment strategies
of lesser or greater effectiveness, in the tables, the information is interpreted best by analyzing columns, which represent escalating effectiveness of treatment; with the
exception of the analysis on second toxicity (Table 7), the
ICERs uniformly increase reading down the columns.

For example, Table 5 indicates that a 50% decrease
in progression rates (ie, shorter time on first-line treatment) for first-line treatment would result in increased
ICERS: The incremental benefit of the most aggressive
treatment (Pair 3) actually would be ‘‘dominated’’ and
would be more costly and less effective. Conversely,
improving the efficacy of front-line therapy (150% of
base case) has the greatest impact on the ICERs, most
likely because the patients spend the longest time on firstline therapy. The results were only modestly sensitive to
the cost of the infusion pump and to the cost or time on
supportive care (results not shown).

Monte Carlo Simulation
Figure 4 shows the Monte Carlo simulation. The scatter
plot illustrates the 2 distinct ‘‘bands’’ of treatment sequences; the steeper slope in the top right portion of the figure
includes the regimens that incorporate antibodies.

DISCUSSION
We observed that survival increases as patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are exposed to all available agents,
but this benefit comes at high cost. This cost exceeds commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds.18 Furthermore, our estimates include only drug costs and represent
conservative estimates of total treatment expense. Patients
who receive 5-FU/LV, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan have
longer survival compared with patients who receive 5-FU/
LV alone, at an ICER of approximately $100,000/DLY.
However, treatment with antibody-containing regimens
is associated with higher ICERs because of the relatively
modest survival benefits and high costs. These results are
similar to an analysis of salvage chemotherapy in platinum-refractory ovarian cancer, in which second-line
monotherapy reportedly came at an ICER of $57,000/
DLY, but the benefits of second-line doublet therapy and
third-line monotherapy came at unacceptably high incremental cost.19 Whether the benefits are worth the costs
clearly depends on the stakeholder; patients with
advanced cancer may perceive greater value than healthy
patients, policymakers, insurers, and physicians.8,9
Our objective was not to compare ‘‘competing’’ regimens such as FOLFOX and FOLFIRI, both of which are

acceptable first-line treatment strategies,20 but instead to
study the impact of sequential progress (new chemotherapy and antibodies) on the overall cost of managing
metastatic colorectal cancer. We observed that similar
treatment sequences (Regimens F and G or Regimens H
and I) had similar life expectancies when prices for brand
irinotecan were used. This suggests that ICERs are
affected not by the sequence in which the drugs are used
but by the effectiveness of the overall treatment strategy.
Our SAs demonstrate that the ICERs are affected most by
changes in first-line therapy, because this is associated
with the longest PFS. This is particularly significant
because a phase 3 study currently is underway that
explores the use of both bevacizumab and cetuximab in
combination with chemotherapy in the front-line setting
(National Clinical Trials [NCT]clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00265850).
We believe that it is reasonable to use life expectancy
rather than quality-adjusted life expectancy as our measure for several reasons. Patients with life-threatening diseases may choose treatments associated with a high risk of
toxicity but low potential benefit.21,22 In addition, using
life expectancy rather than utilities results in a conservative
(lower) estimate for ICERs, because preference weights
for patients with advanced cancer generally are <1.23

Limitations
Decision analysis models are limited by the accuracy of
the probability estimates. Toxicity estimates are based on
published data from phase 3 and multicenter phase 2 trials, which were reported inconsistently. We assumed that
only grade 3 and 4 toxicities would prompt a dose reduction, delay, or change in therapy. However, patients may
discontinue or delay treatment for other reasons.24 In
addition, the rate of toxicities in clinical trials may not
accurately reflect community practice, because a population of patients on a clinical trial may be more robust than
an unselected patient population. However, our SA indicates that changing the toxicity rates (Table 6) does not
significantly alter the ICER, because changes in toxicity
also would be accompanied by changes in drug use. Only
if the probability of second toxicity is 50% in all 3 lines of
treatment would the ICERs drop significantly, as shown
in Table 7.

In our model, we assumed that bevacizumab would
add 4.4 months to FOLFIRI or FOLFOX based on its
benefit when added to IFL.4 However, it is possible that
the benefit of bevacizumab may be less. In trial
NO16966, the magnitude of benefit with the addition of
bevacizumab to chemotherapy was shorter than expected
(9.4 months vs 8 months).25 The addition of bevacizumab
to FOLFIRI in the Bolus, Infusional, or Capecitabine
with Camptosar-Celecoxib (BICC-C) trial resulted in a
PFS of 11.2 months compared with 8.3 months for IFL,
although the difference was not statistically significant.26
If our model overestimates the benefit of the addition of
bevacizumab to front-line chemotherapy, then this will
result in a conservative (lower) estimate of the ICER. Our
SA indicates (Table 6) that a 50% decrease in progression
in first-line therapy results in higher ICERs.
This discrepancy also raises questions regarding the
cost–effectiveness of multidrug regimens. In contrast to
the shorter PFS from the addition of bevacizumab to
FOLFIRI and FOLFOX (11.2 months and 9.4 months,
respectively) reported in these recent clinical trials, a phase
2 study of 5-FU/LV and bevacizumab alone produced a

relatively long median PFS of 9.2 months.27 Therefore,
the benefit of adding oxaliplatin or irinotecan to 5-FU
and bevacizumab needs to be investigated further from
both a clinical standpoint and a cost-effectiveness
standpoint.
We only included intravenous regimens in our
model. Capecitabine is considered equivalent to intravenous 5-FU as a single agent for both localized and metastatic disease. In addition, combined capecitabine and
oxaliplatin reportedly was not inferior to FOLFOX,28
and this regimen also was included in the NCCN guidelines. Studies in the adjuvant setting have indicated, that
despite its higher drug cost, capecitabine may be cost
effective given the reduced drug administration costs and
indirect costs (travel time, lost work).29,30 However,
because we only included drug costs in our model, the
high cost of capecitabine would bias the results against
capecitabine-containing regimens.
We also chose to include only 1 epidermal growth
factor receptor inhibitor in our model. Similar to cetuximab, panitumumab is indicated as a single agent after failure of prior chemotherapy. However, it is not approved in

ular sequence, because patients on the most effective
sequences (Regimens F, G, H, and I) are exposed to all of
the available agents and, thus, most likely will experience
similar associated side effects and management costs. In
current practice, treatment breaks are common.24 Several
strategies are being explored in which patients on FOLFOX or FOLFIRI are offered scheduled periods entirely
off chemotherapy or off oxaliplatin or irinotecan.31,32 If
treatment ‘‘holidays’’ for select patients produce survival
similar to that of patients who are treated continuously,
then the ICERs may be improved, because such patients
will not be accruing comparably high treatment-related
costs.

combination with chemotherapy. In addition, there is no
role for the sequential use of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. Although there are no head-to-head
data comparing panitumumab and cetuximab, the median PFS for panitumumab as last-line therapy is similar
(8 weeks vs 1.5 months). Because cetuximab can be used
both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy, we chose to use it in our model. This may result
in higher ICERs, because drug costs for panitumumab are
lower than those for cetuximab (Table 2). However, the
SAs for drug costs indicated (Table 8) that decreasing
drug costs in the third-line setting only results in small
changes in the ICERs given the modest activity of these
agents and short duration of therapy for most patients
who are treated in these settings. For example, when drug
costs are decreased to 25% of the base case for all 3 lines of
treatment, ICERs decrease significantly. However, if only
third-line drug costs are considered, then the ICERs drop
only modestly.
We also did not include the costs of managing toxicities such as diarrhea or infection, because these should be
small relative to overall drug costs. We do not believe that
this would bias the results significantly in favor of a particCancer

Future Directions
Although our study used metastatic colorectal cancer as a
platform for discussion, these issues are relevant to many
cancer types for which advances in translational research
have led to the introduction of new targeted therapies.
The costs for palliative treatment most likely will increase
as patients are treated with sequential therapies until death
or toxicity.
Given these high costs, future studies should be
designed to address both dose intensity and duration of
treatment. For example, although bevacizumab was
approved at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in conjunction with FOLFOX, it is unclear whether this dose is
more beneficial than the previously approved dose of 5
mg/kg every 2 weeks that was studied in conjunction with
IFL.33 In addition, it is important to establish the role of
continuing antibody therapy after failure of first-line
chemotherapy. It is also important to identify which
patients are most likely to benefit from these treatments;
recent data suggest that patients with mutant KRAS derive
no benefit from the addition of cetuximab to FOLFOX or
FOLFIRI, whereas patients with wild-type KRAS demonstrate improved outcomes.34,35 Other studies also have
demonstrated that the efficacy of panitumumab also is
confined to patients with wild-type KRAS.36
The cost will decrease as generic drugs become available. At the time this article was written, the payment for
branded irinotecan was approximately 145% greater than
generic versions. Our SA on drug costs indicated (Table
8) that a 50% decrease in the cost of first-line therapy will
result in a $1200 decrease in the ICER for Pair 3; the
2089

most substantial decreases occur when all 3 lines of treatment occur simultaneously. However, because oxaliplatin,
bevacizumab, and cetuximab all remain under patent protection, the overall cost of treatment still will remain very
high. Nevertheless, the availability of treatment raises an
important societal question. When prices for generic irinotecan are used, the results clearly favor using regimens
that include FOLFIRI in the front-line setting given the
lower cost (Fig. 3). This is supported by our finding that
ICERs are most sensitive to changes in cost in the frontline therapy given the longer duration of treatment.
Although both FOLFIRI and FOLFOX are acceptable
front-line regimens, the majority of physicians in the US
choose FOLFOX for front-line treatment.37 Although the
current reimbursement system for chemotherapy does not
favor the use of generic regimens, payors may want to consider this as a mechanism for cost control when similar
clinical outcomes are obtained with alternate treatments
that vary widely in cost. The potential savings to payers
(including taxpayers) will need to be weighed against
patients’ and physicians’ preferences for side effects.
The cost of cancer care will continue to rise as new
palliative treatments are introduced, and patients incur
costs as they live longer. It is hoped that some treatments
that are introduced in the context of metastatic disease
ultimately may demonstrate greater value in the adjuvant
setting. Cost-effectiveness assessments should be included
in studies of new treatments, such that policymakers can
make more informed decisions regarding coverage and
patients and oncologists can make the most informed
decisions regarding treatment.
