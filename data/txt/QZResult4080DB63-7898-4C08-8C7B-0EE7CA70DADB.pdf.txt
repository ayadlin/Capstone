ABSTRACT
Here we demonstrate that a ubiquitin E3-ligase, FBXO21, targets the multidrug
resistance transporter, ABCB1, also known as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), for proteasomal
degradation. We also show that the Ser291-phosphorylated form of the multifunctional
protein and stem cell marker, CD44, inhibits FBXO21-directed degradation of P-gp.
Thus, CD44 increases P-gp mediated drug resistance and represents a potential
therapeutic target in P-gp-positive cells.

INTRODUCTION

is not usually expressed in the normal ovary although it
is expressed in 40-60% of primary ovarian tumors [25]. Likewise, CD44 is not expressed in normal breast
tissue but is expressed in 80% of metastatic breast cancer.
Importantly, CD44 has been identified as a “stem cell”
marker for both breast and ovarian cancer [6, 7].
P-gp, the product of the MDR1 gene, is a 150-180
kDa, heavily glycosylated transmembrane ATP-dependent
transporter known to pump cytotoxic drugs out of the cell,
and its overexpression confers resistance to a variety of
structurally diverse anticancer drugs such as vinblastine,
doxorubicin and paclitaxel [8, 9]. Increased P-gp
expression is observed in 60% of metastatic breast cancer
and 30% of ovarian tumors [8], and is associated with poor
outcome in cancer patients, presumably because it imparts
resistance to cancer treatment [10, 11]. Despite efforts to
develop drugs that interfere with the function of P-gp, the
goal of restoring drug sensitivity in multidrug-resistant
cells has not yet been clinically successful. Inhibition of
the intrinsic mechanisms of the cell involved in controlling
P-gp stability is an alternative approach to P-gp function
interference. However, data from previous studies on the
stability of P-gp are limited, and no evidence related to
the targeting of P-gp for ubiquiination by an E3 ligase has
been previously reported [12].

The majority of cancer deaths are secondary
to the development of metastases and tumor drug
resistance although the biological link between these
two phenotypes is unclear. In our previous work we
showed that a membrane protein implicated in cancer
metastases, CD44, activates the expression of a protein
known to generate drug resistance, P-glycoprotein (P-gp),
also known as the ABCB1 transporter [1]. Although the
physical association of these 2 proteins was supported
by their co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization
within the cell membrane, and the induction of P-gp by
CD44 overexpression was previously documented in our
laboratory [1], the mechanism by which CD44 activates
the drug resistance phenotype is still elusive.
The CD44 gene contains 19 exons and is
alternatively spliced, giving rise to many CD44 isoforms.
When the central 10 exons are spliced out, the CD44
“standard isoform” (CD44s) is expressed. CD44s, an
~85 kDa glycoprotein, is a receptor for hyaluronan, a
major component of extracellular matrices. CD44 has
been shown to be a useful tumor marker for disease
progression and metastasis in certain types of cancers, and
our laboratory, as well as others, has shown that CD44

The purpose of this study was to elucidate a
mechanism by which CD44 enhances P-gp-mediated
drug resistance. We created a yeast two-hybrid system
where transmembrane proteins can be expressed in the
cell. Using this unique system, we were able to quickly
evaluate the effect of CD44 mutations on P-gp function
and expression. We used a high throughput siRNA ligase
library screening method and a rapid in vitro test for P-gp
function to select candidates for a P-gp-targeted E3 ligase.
We present evidence to support FBXO21, an orphan
E3 ligase, as the E3 ligase involved in the proteasomemediated degradation of P-gp, and also elucidated a
new mechanism for CD44 promotion of P-gp-directed
drug resistance. Although proteasome inhibitors are
currently being tested as anti-cancer therapy, major
advances in treatment are more likely to be made through
the targeting of specific ubiquitination factors such as
E3 ligases. Furthermore, dual targeting of two cancerrelated membrane proteins may allow for the preferential
selection of cancer cells while sparing normal cells from
drug toxicity.

We also tested whether the CD44/P-gp proteinprotein interaction has an effect on drug resistance in
yeast. Valinomycin is an ionophoric antibiotic that has
the ability to cross the yeast cell wall and also has been
shown to be a P-gp substrate [14]. Serially diluted cells
were spotted on one plate without vancomycin and two
plates containing different concentrations of valinomycin
(Figure 1C). Valinomycin was found to be toxic to the
wild type and the CD44 transformant strains. In contrast,
the P-gp transformant cells were resistant to valinomycin,
confirming that P-gp confers valinomycin resistance to
yeast. Remarkably, the co-expression of CD44 with P-gp
enhanced valinomycin resistance four-fold over the P-gp
alone transformant yeast cells, while the presence of CD44
alone did not confer any drug resistance, indicating that
the interaction of CD44 with P-gp, and not CD44 by itself,
was conferring an increased drug resistance phenotype to
the yeast strain.

P-glycoprotein mediated drug resistance is
dependent on the CD44 phosphorylation state

RESULTS

In resting cells, CD44 is constitutively
phosphorylated at Ser325. After PKC is activated, a
switch in phosphorylation occurs whereby Ser291 and
Ser325 become phosphorylated and dephosophorylated,
respectively. [15] The total amount of phosphorylation
of CD44 remains the same, although only one of the
two residues is phosphorylated at any given time. This
phosphorylation switch was reported to result in the
disengagement of ezrin and loss of cytoskeletal association
[15, 16]. These findings prompted us to investigate whether
the phosphorylation of CD44 was relevant to the increased
drug resistance phenotype. Therefore, we examined the
phosphorylation status of CD44 in P-gp-positive and P-gpnegative cell lines using SKA, an ovarian carcinoma cell
line that expresses CD44 but not P-gp and MCF-7/Adr
breast cancer cells that express both CD44s and P-gp, and
a specific antibody to the CD44 Ser325 phophorylated
residue. Figure 1D shows Western blots illustrating
that CD44 is constitutively phosphorylated at Ser325 in
SKA cells (Lane 1). When SKA cells were treated with
protein kinase C activator (PMA), the dephosphorylation
of Ser325 was apparent (Lane 2). Interestingly, in the
MCF7/Adr cell line where both P-gp and CD44 are
expressed, there was no constitutive phosphorylation at
Ser325 (Lane 3) and no effect of PMA treatment (Lane 4).
It is reasonable to assume that these cells constitutively
express CD44 phosphorylated at Ser291. Because there
are no antibodies specific to CD44 phosphorylated
at Ser291, we inhibited PKC which is known to
phosphorylate CD44 at this position. When MCF7/Adr
cells were treated with a PKC inhibitor, CD44 Ser325
became phosphorylated, indicating that CD44 Ser291 is
constitutively phorphorylated in MCF7/Adr cells (Lane 5).

CD44 interacts with P-glycoprotein in a yeast two
hybrid system and increases P-gp induced drug
resistance
To characterize the physical relationship between
CD44 and P-gp, we took advantage of a split ubiquitin
yeast two hybrid system that has the ability to screen for
interactions among transmembrane proteins [13]. In this
system, the MDR1 gene was fused with the N-terminal half
of ubiquitin and CD44 was fused with the C-terminal half
of ubiquitin which is linked to the artificial transcription
factor PLV. Next, both plasmids were transformed into
the reporter yeast strain (DSY-1). A positive interaction
between P-gp and CD44 would allow the split ubiquitin to
interact and conform to the structure of native ubiquitin.
The assembled ubiquitin is recognized by a carboxyterminal hydrolase and cleaved, thereby liberating the
transcription activator PLV. Subsequently, PLV enters the
nucleus by diffusion and binds to the LexA binding sites,
leading to the activation of LacZ and HIS3 reporter genes
and resulting in blue cells in the presence of X-Gal and
growth of the cells on plates lacking histidine, leucine
and tryptophan, respectively. When the co-transfection
of CD44 and MDR1 was performed in this yeast system,
we observed blue colonies growing in the essential
minimal media, indicating that the two proteins (ie, CD44
and P-gp) are close to each other at the cell membrane
(Figure 1A). We corroborated the finding that both
proteins are expressed at the cell membrane by subcellular
fractionation and Western blot (Figure 1B).

These experiments suggest that CD44 phosphorylation at
Ser291 may be a key step in the binding of CD44 to P-gp
and/or the CD44-related enhancement of the P-gp-induced
drug resistance phenotype.
To determine whether changes in the
phosphorylation of CD44 have an effect on CD44 binding
to P-gp, CD44 Ser291 or Ser325 to alanine (Figure 1E)
or aspartate (Figure 1F) point mutations were created and
co-transformed with P-gp in yeast. Growth of these yeast

strains in minimal media indicate that the binding of CD44
to P-gp was not inhibited by these point mutations (Figure
1E). However, when the functional role of P-gp in these
strains was tested, we found that the CD44-Ser325Ala
mutant showed a level of valinomycin resistance similar
to that of wild type CD44 whereas the CD44-Ser291Ala
mutant reversed the valinomycin resistance with the cells
becoming as sensitive to the drug as the wild type strain in
the presence of P-gp expression.

Figure 1: CD44 phosphorylation status affects P-glycoprotein mediated drug resistance. A. A split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid

assay was used to detect protein-protein interactions between P-gp and CD44. Budding yeast DSY-1 cells expressing MDR1 (in pTMBV4)
and CD44s (in pDL2-X-Cub) as indicated, were grown on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan and histidine (HIS3) or containing X-Gal
(LacZ), showing activation of the HIS3 and lacZ reporters respectively. When both MDR1 and CD44 genes were expressed yeast colonies
grew in minimal media. B. Subcellular distribution of the expressed P-gp and CD44s. Membrane expression of both full length proteins
is shown. C. DSY-1 cells expressing CD44, P-gp or both CD44 and P-gp along with untransformed wild type were grown overnight and
serially diluted in liquid culture to an OD600 reading of 0.2, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.025 and spotted on a minimal synthetic plate with different
concentrations of valinomycin as indicated. Colony spots were photographed as shown. D. Phosphorylation of CD44 at Ser 325 using an
antibody specific for the CD44 Ser325 phosphorylated residue on Western blot analysis. Ovarian cancer cell line, SKA (Lanes 1 and 2)
known to be P-gp(-)/CD44(+) and chemosensitive was compared with the MCF7/Adr cell line (Lanes 3-5) that is P-gp(+)/CD44(+). Cells
were treated with PMA to induce PKC and hence phosphorylation of Ser291 of CD44 (Lane 2 and 4). Cells were treated with the PKC
inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide to inhibit phosphorylation at Ser291 (Lane 5). Total amounts of CD44 and P-gp were determined by probing
with the respective monoclonal antibodies. Anti-tubulin antibody was used as loading control. E. CD44 Ser to Ala mutations at either
residue 291 or 325 were created and co-transformed with P-gp in the yeast two hybrid system. Serially 10-fold dilution cultures grown
overnight were spotted on a minimal synthetic plate with or without 50μM valinomycin. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 3 days. Colony
spots were photographed. F. CD44 Ser to Asp mutations at either residue 291 or 325 were created and co-transformed with P-gp in the yeast
two hybrid system. Serially 10-fold dilution cultures grown overnight were spotted on a minimal synthetic plate with or without 50μM
valinomycin. Plates were incubated at 30°C for 3 days. Colony spots were photographed.

We further postulated that the substitution of
serine by aspartate would mimic a “dominant ON”
phosphorylation effect on the cells. Figure 1F illustrates
that colonies co-expressing CD44 Ser291Asp with P-gp
were as drug resistant as those colonies co-expressing wild
type CD44 and P-gp. These results are consistent with the
involvement of Ser291-phosphorylated CD44 in the drug
resistant phenotype.
The phenotype exhibiting increased drug resistance
that is observed when CD44 is expressed could be due to
increased expression of P-gp either through transcriptional
regulation or increased protein stability. However, in
our yeast system the MDR1 gene is not driven by its
own promoter. Therefore, any transcriptional changes
induced by CD44 are not detectable in this system. We
corroborated this by qPCR. The MDR1 transcript levels
were the same in all of the strains, demonstrating that

increased protein stability is a reasonable explanation for
the increased drug resistance phenotype observed in yeast
(Figure 1S).

P-Glycoprotein protein stability is increased by
CD44
To test the effect of CD44 on P-gp stability, a
cycloheximide chase on P-gp-expressing yeast strains
with and without CD44s or CD44 phosphorylation mutant
co-expression was performed (Figures 2A, 2B). After six
hours of incubation in cycloheximide, cell lysates were
prepared and separated by gel electrophoresis. Western
blotting revealed that more than 50% of P-gp was
degraded within four hours in the strain that expressed
P-gp alone (Figure 2A, Block 1). On the other hand, the

subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody and an anti-alpha tubulin monoclonal antibody as loading

as well as in the conditional proteasome mutant cim5-1 at the permissive temperature (23°C) and later at the non-permissive temperature
(37°C) where the proteasome is nonfunctional in the cim5-1 mutant. Aliquots were drawn at the respective time points as indicated and P-gp
expression were evaluated by Western blot analysis using anti-P-gp along with alpha tubulin monoclonal antibodies D. The band intensities
from blot C were quantified using densitometry. E. Yeast strains harboring P-gp with and without CD44 or its phosphorylation mutants were
transformed with a myc-tagged ubiquitin plasmid with a CUP promoter. Cells were grown in the absence or presence of added CuSO4 as
indicated. The expression of P-gp, and tubulin were studied by Western blot analysis using anti-P-gp, and anti-alpha tubulin monoclonal
antibodies as labeled.

yeast strain that co-expressed P-gp and CD44 exhibited
a longer P-gp half-life that exceeded 6 hours (Figure 2A
Block II). We then tested P-gp stability when it was coexpressed with the CD44 Ser291Ala phosphorylation
mutant. Interestingly, the stability of Pg-p was reverted
back to that observed with the P-gp alone phenotype,
indicating that the CD44 Ser291Ala mutant did not show
any protective role on the half-life of P-gp (4 hrs. vs. 4.5
hrs for P-gp alone expressing cells (Figure 2A Block III
and Figure 2B). On the other hand, the phenotype of the
CD44 Ser325Ala mutant was similar to that of wild type
CD44/P-gp transformant; it imparted the same increased
half-life to P-gp as wild type CD44 (Figure 2A Block IV
and Figure 2B). These experiments indicate that CD44
confers stability to P-gp or alternatively, protects P-gp
from degradation when CD44 is phosphorylated at Ser291.

promoter. Cells were grown in the presence or absence of
CuSO4. Cell lysates were prepared and the levels of P-gp
were examined by Western blot and densitometry. Figure
2E illustrates that the level of P-gp was significantly
lower in the transformant that expressed P-gp alone after
induction of ubiquitin activity with CuSO4. On the other
hand, the P-gp level remained the same in the wild type
CD44 strain before and after induction of the c-myc
tagged ubiquitin. Importantly, the P-gp level in the yeast
strains with the CD44 Ser291Ala mutant was decreased
when ubiquitin was induced, whereas the amount of P-gp
remained stable after the induction of ubiquitin in the
CD44 Ser325Ala mutant strain, showing a similar degree
of P-gp stability as observed when wild type CD44 was
expressed.

the

CD44 protects P-gp from ubiquitination in
mammalian cells

To investigate whether P-gp stability was regulated
by 26S proteasome-mediated degradation, P-gp was
overexpressed in yeast strains harboring conditional
mutations in the 19S regulatory sub-unit of the 26S
proteasome and in the wild type parent strain. The
conditional alleles are in the gene encoding the AAA+
ATPase Cim5. We measured the level of P-gp expression
in the parent strain and in the heat sensitive cim5-1 mutant
at the permissive temperature (23° C) and then at the nonpermissive temperature (37° C) at different points in time
(Figure 2C). The level of P-gp expression at the permissive
temperature was considered the basal level for both the
mutant and parent strain. The proteasome machinery is
fully functional at the permissive temperature, both in
wild type and mutant strains, whereas the proteasome is
impaired in the mutant strain only at the non-permissive
temperature. At 37°C, P-gp was degraded significantly
faster in the parent strain compared with the cim5-1
mutant strain. Figure 2D shows a graphical representation
of the P-gp turnover in the cim5-1 mutant and the parent
strain at the non-permissive temperature. More than 50%
of the P-gp protein was degraded during the first 2 hrs at
37° C in the wild type strain. In contrast, in the cim5-1
mutant strain, the majority of the P-gp accumulated even
after 5 hrs at the non-permissive temperature where the
proteasome is inactive (Figure 2D). These results reveal
that P-gp is degraded by the proteasomal pathway; we
therefore postulated that ubiquitin would be involved in
the process.
To determine the role of ubiquitin in the degradation
of P-gp, we used a functional c-myc epitope-tagged
ubiquitin (myc-Ub). Yeast strains expressing P-gp alone,
P-gp with either wild type CD44 or the phosphorylation
defective CD44 mutants at Ser291 or Ser325 were
transformed with YEp105 under the control of the CUP1

To study whether the CD44-mediated protection of
P-gp from ubiquitination is also present in mammalian
cells, we tested the stability of P-gp using a cycloheximide
chase analysis in a breast cancer cell line that expresses
P-gp but not CD44 (MCF-7/BC19) and in a cell line
that expresses both P-gp and CD44 (MCF-7/Adr).
We performed Western blots of both cell lines after
cycloheximide treatment at different time points. As
observed in yeast, the results show that the degradation
of P-gp was significantly delayed in the cell line that
co-expresses CD44 and P-gp when compared with the
MCF-7/BC19 cells that express P-gp but not CD44
(Figure 3A). Figure 3B shows a graphical representation
of a densitometry analysis of the Western blot depicting
that more than 50% of P-gp was degraded in 6.5 hrs in
the P-gp(+)/CD44(-) cell line. On the other hand, when
P-gp and CD44 were co-expressed, the amount of P-gp
expressed remained stable even after 12 hrs of treatment
with cycloheximide. Thus, the stability of P-gp is also
critically dependent on CD44 expression in mammalian
cells. We then tested for the role of proteasomal
degradation of P-gp using the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 to block ubiquitin-dependent degradation (Figure
3C and 3D). We found that when proteasome function was
inhibited in MCF-7/BC19 cells, P-gp accumulated in a
time dependent fashion. On the other hand, when P-gp was
co-expressed with CD44 there was no significant change
in the level of P-gp measured before and after proteasomal
inhibition. These results suggest that CD44 promotes the
stability of P-gp by inhibiting the proteasome-mediated
degradation of P-gp.
We next sought to test the role of CD44 and
its phosphorylation status on P-gp ubiquitination in
mammalian cells. We used a temperature-sensitive
ubiquitination mutant, ts20 3T3, derived from the mouse
cell line BALB/c 3T3 [17]. Full length CD44 or either

at residue 291 or 325 were stably expressed in ts20 3T3 cells that contained a temperature-sensitive defect in the E1 ubiquitin activating

cultured at the restrictive (39°C) temperature (ubiquitination defective) for 18 hours. Cell lysates were collected and probed with anti-P-gp
and anti-tubulin monoclonal antibodies. F. MCF-7/BC19 cells were transfected with either empty vector, full length CD44s or the CD44

detected low levels of P-gp in cells expressing P-gp alone
at the ubiquitination permissive temperature. When
ubiquitination was inhibited by raising the temperature to
39° C, the P-gp band accumulated, indicating a role for
ubiquitination in the P-gp stability of mammalian cells.
On the other hand, the cell line that co-expressed CD44
and P-gp maintained the same level of P-gp expression
whether ubiquitination was active or not, indicating that
CD44 protected P-gp from ubiquitin-directed degradation.
Cells co-expressing P-gp with CD44 Ser291Ala mutant
protein showed accumulation of P-gp at 39° C, similar
to the accumulation observed in the P-gp (+)/CD44 (-)
cell line. This experiment demonstrates that the CD44protective effect on P-gp degradation is absent in cells
expressing the CD44 Ser291Ala mutant. On the other
hand, cells expressing the CD44 Ser325Ala mutant
showed an amount of protection against P-gp degradation
similar to that rendered by wild type CD44. These results
confirm our findings in the yeast system and further
establish that CD44 protects P-gp from ubiquitin-targeted
degradation. Furthermore, CD44 phosphorylation at
Ser291 is demonstrated to be essential for this function.
To further evaluate the role of CD44 on the P-gp-induced
drug resistant phenotype, and to determine whether P-gp
was functional, the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin, a known
substrate of P-gp, was analyzed in breast cancer cells
(Figure 3F). Cell viability was determined by MTT assays
following treatment with doxorubicin. P-gp-positive cells
transfected with empty vector were used as a control.
Similar to the yeast system, CD44 induced a higher level
of drug resistance that was reversed when the CD44
Ser291Ala mutation was introduced. Western blotting
demonstrated increased expression of P-gp in CD44
transfectants compared with P-gp expression in CD44
Ser291Ala mutant cells and the empty vector transfectants
(Figure 3G).

To corroborate that phosphorylation at Ser291
is required for CD44-mediated protection of P-gp from
ubiquitination, we inhibited Ser291 phosphorylation
by using bisindolymaleimide, a PKC inhibitor. An
additional in vivo ubiquitination experiment was done
using HEK293T cells co-transfected with His-tagged
P-gp, ubiquitin and CD44 constructs. The ubiquitination
level of P-gp was detected by immunoblotting. Figure 3I
shows that bisindolylmaleimide treatment inhibited the
protective effect of CD44 on P-gp ubiquitination in the
CD44 transfected group (Lane 3) when compared with
the no treatment group. The overall P-gp ubiquitination
level when CD44 was not expressed was similar to the
P-gp ubiquitination level when CD44 was expressed after
treatment with the PKC inhibitor. These results corroborate
that the phosphorylation of CD44 at Ser291 is required for
the CD44 protection of P-gp from ubiquitination.

FBXO21 is an E3 ligase for P-gp
To identify an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the
degradation of P-gp, we performed an RNAi library screen
on cells expressing either P-gp alone, both P-gp and CD44
or neither P-gp nor CD44. A SMARTpool library of 329
siRNAs targeting known or predicted human E3 ubiquitin
ligases was transfected into the above mentioned cell lines
along with a nontargeting control siRNA. Fluorescent
substrate accumulation assays to measure P-gp efflux
function was performed on the siRNA-treated cells using
calcein AM as substrate. This assay measures the amount
of calcein AM that is recognized and exported by P-gp
from the plasma membrane of cells into the outside media.
Cells that do not express P-gp would accumulate more
intracellular fluorescence substrate compared to the cells
that express P-gp. We aimed to identify those siRNAs that
specifically increased the function of P-gp only in the cells
that were P-gp(+)/CD44(-) and not in the cells expressing
both P-gp and CD44 or no P-gp (Figure 4A, labeled pink).
Most of the siRNAs targeting genes in more than one
group were eliminated from the final analysis because
those genes would affect drug resistance independent
of P-gp. After the analysis, a short list of 10 genes was
identified that specifically increased the function of P-gp
in P-gp(+)/CD44(-) cells and therefore had the potential
to specifically inhibit the function of the P-gp ligase. The
list of genes identified and the normalized values are given
in Table S1. To validate possible E3 ligase candidates we
tested for fluorescence uptake after transfecting P-gp(+)/
CD44(-) cells with different E3 ligase siRNAs (Figure
4B). Our analysis depicted MNAT1 as the best candidate
for the E3 ligase (Figure 4C); however, when tested, it
did not show E3 ligase activity (data not shown). We next
screened FBXO21 as a potential P-gp E3 ligase. We first
determined whether FBXO21 would bind to P-gp using
co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We performed
reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation studies in which

P-gp is ubiquitinated in vivo
In vivo ubiquitination experiments were performed
to verify ubiquitination of P-gp. A co-transfection of
His-tagged MDR1, CD44 and HA-tagged ubiquitin in
HEK293T cells followed by purification of ubiquitinated
proteins on nickel resins, allowed detection of
ubiquitinated P-gp in vivo (Figure 3H). Lane 1 reveals
that P-gp is ubiquitinated in vivo and shows its basal
level of ubiquitination. Lane 2 shows that the overall
level of ubiquitinated P-gp was reduced by the expression
of full-length wild type CD44 when compared with
control CD44-negative cells in Lane 1. Interestingly,
P-gp ubiquitination was noticeably increased when the
CD44 Ser291Ala phosphorylation mutant was expressed
(Lane 3). Conversely, when the Ser325Ala mutant was
expressed, P-gp was again protected from ubiquitination
at a level similar to the protection conferred by wild type
CD44 (Lane 4).

recombinant Myc-tagged FBXO21 and His-tagged P-gp
were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells. Figure 4D
illustrates that FBXO21 co-immunoprecipitated with P-gp.
In vivo ubiquitination studies were done by cotransfecting His-tagged P-gp with HA-tagged ubiquitin
along with wild type and/or the dominant-negative
FBXO21 mutant (dFBXO21) in HEK293T cells with or
without CD44. Figure 4E shows that the level of ubiquitinconjugated P-gp was noticeably increased when FBXO21
was overexpressed (Lane 2, upper panel) and the overall

level of His-P-gp was concomitantly reduced (Lane 2,
lower panel). As expected, the expression of dFBXO21
inhibited the activity of FBXO21 as evidenced by a
decreased level of ubiquitination and increased expression
of P-gp (Lane 3). Furthermore, CD44 protected P-gp from
ubiquitination with FBXO21 as indicated by the less
prominent an ubiquitination smear (Lane 4, upper panel).

with an siRNA ubiquitin ligase library targeting 329 known and predicted ubiquitin ligases. A change in drug uptake ability between the
different genotypes was measured using calcein AM, a fluorescent substrate for P-gp. Candidate genes directly affected by siRNAs only
in MCF-7/P-gp(+) and not in MCF-7/P-gp(+)/CD44(+) and parental MCF7 (P-gp(-)/CD44(-) cells) with the highest p-value in three

transfected with His-tagged P-gp, HA tagged ubiquitin, CD44, FBXO21 or dFBXO21. Cell lysates were separated and His-tagged P-gp was

tagged P-gp, FBXO21, Skpl, Cul1 and Roc1 were preincubated together to allow for the assembly of the SCFP-gp complex. Ubiquitination was then initiated by the
addition of biotinylated-ubiquitin, E1, E2, PKC, and
ATP. The reaction products were analyzed for a higher
molecular weight smear characteristic of ubiquitinated
proteins. Figure 4F shows that when all the components
were present, a high molecular weight band was evident
as a ubiquitinated complex. We then performed an in
vitro reconstitution time course experiment where a
FLAG-tagged P-gp was used as a substrate and mixed
with purified E2, FBXO21-SCF-CUL1 and ubiquitin.
The reaction was started by the addition of ATP and
stopped by the addition of sample buffer at different time
points. The ubiquitinated P-gp complexes were analyzed
by Western blotting probing with anti-FLAG antibody.
Figure 5 depicts a P-gp complex evident at 45 minutes that
increases in intensity by 90 minutes. Exclusion of either
ubiquitin or FBXO21 completely blocked the reaction.
These observations provide definitive biochemical
evidence that P-gp ubiquitination can be reconstituted in
vitro and that FBXO21 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for P-gp.

of P-gp, a member of the ABC family of transporters [18,
19]. Although in vitro inhibition of the P-gp drug transport
pump causes cancer cells to become drug sensitive,
clinical trials have failed to replicate the in vitro findings,
mostly as a result of complications related to unanticipated
toxicities [20]. In a previous study, we treated an ovarian
cancer mouse xenograft with siRNA targeting CD44, and
showed that the resulting reduction of CD44 expression
in the tumor correlated with decreased expression of
P-gp and increased drug cytotoxicity [21]. Our present
work provides further insight into the regulation of P-gp
expression by CD44 which is needed to more effectively
design the next generation of compounds that will both
overcome multidrug resistance in cancer cells and be less
toxic to normal cells.
The ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal
processing of other integral membrane transporters such as
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) has been previously reported [22-24]. In addition,
Ohkawa and colleagues demonstrated that ubiquitinated
P-gp accumulates after inhibition of calpain hydrolyisis
[25]. Glycosylated, fully-mature P-gp is known to have a
long half-life (14 hrs),[26-28] and P-gp ubiquitination of
unglycosylated P-gp has been shown to be independent
of P-gp phosphorylation [12]. However, the mechanisms
governing the proteasomal degradation of mature P-gp
have remained largely unknown. The data presented here

DISCUSSION
Multidrug resistance, a major reason for failure of
anti-cancer therapy, can be caused by the overexpression

provide molecular insight into the mechanism of P-gp
degradation, a process that is almost completely impeded
by the cellular expression of CD44. Furthermore, these
results support the existence of a newly uncovered
mechanism by which CD44 increases drug resistance in
cancer cells.
In the present work, a yeast two-hybrid system
was designed specifically for the study of membrane
protein interactions. In this system, P-gp is expressed in
a fully functional form as an integral protein capable of
pumping out valinomycin, a P-gp substrate toxic to yeast
cells; it also allows for the systematic investigation of the
binding between P-gp and CD44 to determine the effects
of this interaction on drug resistance. Our results reveal a
previously unknown function for CD44 in the promotion
of drug resistance through stabilization of P-gp and
inhibition of its proteasome-targeted ubiquitination.
Misra et.al. reported that CD44 regulates
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activity, an
enzyme involved in the stimulation of P-gp expression
[29]. In addition, we previously showed that CD44
induced P-gp expression at the mRNA level [1]. Our new
findings expand the current understanding of the regulation
of cancer drug resistance by CD44, demonstrating the
CD44-mediated inhibition of P-gp ubiquitination. Our
work, together with the work of Misra and colleagues,
demonstrates that P-gp expression in cancer cells is tightly
controlled by CD44.
In this work, P-gp (ABCB1 transporter) is identified
as a physiologic substrate of FBXO21, an orphan E3 ligase
of the F-box family of ligases which are characterized as
being without a recognizable protein interaction domain
[30-32]. In addition, FBXO21 is shown to catalyze
ubiquitination of P-gp, thereby targeting it for subsequent
proteasomal degradation. Further, a phosphorylated form
of CD44 is shown to be a strong inhibitor of FBXO21directed ubiquitination of P-gp. Although phosphorylation
of P-gp is not necessary for its ubiquitination, the
degree of P-gp stability is critically dependent on the
PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of CD44 at its Ser291
residue. We also show here that mutations of CD44 at
Ser291 are associated with increased cellular sensitivity
to chemotherapy drugs as well as lower expression of
P-gp. These results demonstrate that the protection of
P-gp ubiquitination provided by CD44 is functional
and biologically relevant. CD44 is constitutively
phosphorylated at Ser325 and this form of the receptor
binds to ezrin, the protein that links CD44 to the actin
cytoskeleton. A concomitant dephosphorylation of Ser325
and phosphorylation of Ser291 ensues on PKC activation
of CD44, resulting in the disengagement of ezrin and loss
of cytoskeletal association [15]. Interestingly, P-gp also
binds to ezrin and inhibition of ezrin synthesis restores
drug sensitivity in P-gp-positive cells [33]. Whether ezrin
needs to be disengaged from CD44 and subsequently bind
to P-gp for CD44 to protect P-gp from ubiquitin-mediated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

degradation is yet to be determined.
In conclusion, this work elucidates a previously
unknown mechanism of P-gp control by CD44 that could
be exploited in the design of the next generation of P-gp
antagonists. By targeting only those cells expressing both
CD44 and P-gp, it may be possible to circumvent the
drug toxicities previously encountered in clinical trials of
agents targeting P-gp function alone. Using this approach,
normal cells from the gastrointestinal tract and blood-brain
barrier that constitutively overexpress P-gp would not be
targeted and toxicities to these organs would be spared.
We also speculate that by targeting P-gp-positive/CD44positive cancer cells, we will be aiming at cancer stem
cells that are slow growing and more difficult to kill with
standard cytotoxic agents.
Finally, we can extrapolate our findings to other
areas of biology and medicine, such as the use of protease
inhibitors and cyclosporine in the setting of AIDS and
transplantation, respectively [34, 35]. In those situations,
targeting CD44 may also provide a less toxic approach
than direct inhibiton of P-gp. [36, 37].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains and growth conditions
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains DSY-1 (MATa
his3Z200 trp1-901, leu2-3, 112 ade2LYS2::(lexAop)4HIS3 URA3::lexAop)8-lacZ GAL4), and CMY 791
(MATa ura 3-52, leu 2Z1, his-3-Z200, cim5-1) were
used for the studies. Cells were grown in either YTDA
or SD dropout medium at 30° C for the normal strains
and 24° C for cim5-1 temperature-sensitive strains [38].
The AAA+ ATPase Cim5 proteasome mutant yeast
strain was provided by K. Madura.[38] C-myc tagged
ubiquitin was expressed from the yeast-Escherichia coli
plasmid, YEp105, under the control of CUP1 promoter
by the addition of copper sulfate (CuSO4) (at a final
concentration of 100uM) for 30 minutes [39].

Mammalian cell lines
The source and maintenance of the human breast
cancer cell lines were previously described. [1] The
human ovarian carcinoma cell line, SKA, was provided
by Dr John Ludlow (University of Rochester, NY). They
were maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA), supplemented with 10% FCS (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA), 100 ug/mL streptomycin and 100 units/
mL penicillin. Cells were incubated at 37C under 95%
air/5% CO2 in a standard humidified incubator. (See
Supplementary Table 2 for characterization of cells.)

using the Baculo Gold Kit (BD). Purified proteins were

These assays were performed as previously
described
[1].

Viability assay

Split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid assay

Cell viability was determined by MTT assays
following treatment with doxorubicin. P-gp-positive cells
transfected with empty vector were used as a control as
previously described [44].

Split ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid assays were
performed using a Dual membrane system (Dualsystems
Biotech) [13]. Clones were selected on leucine-tryptophanhistidine triple selection plates in the presence of 3mM
3-aminotrazole. Protein interaction was monitored by
the expression of the reporter genes HIS3 and lacZ, and
the strongest positive clones were identified and used
for subsequent studies. The drug resistance profiles were
determined by the spot assay [40] by serially diluting
overnight grown cultures onto CD complete plates in the
absence and presence of valinomycin.

Screening siRNA library
The Silencer siRNA libraries (Ambion) provide
1nmole of each of three individual siRNAs per target for
genes covering 325 known and predicted human ubiquitin
E3 ligases in 96 well plates. Each siRNA was diluted and
aliquoted in black clear-bottom 96-well plates (Corning,
3712) by dispensing 10μl of the corresponding siRNA
pools (100nM). 0.5μl of siPORT NeoFXT transfection
reagent (Ambion) was diluted in 10μl of Opti-Mem media
(Invitrogen) and the mixture was aliquoted to each well
and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. MCF7, MCF-7/P-gp(+) and MCF-7/P-gp(+)/CD44(+) cells
were trypsinized, and re-suspended in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% FBS and diluted so that 6000
cells/80μl were delivered to each well. The plates were
then incubated at 37° C, in 5% CO2 for 2 days. After
2 days of RNAi treatment, the cells were treated with
calcein AM for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBS
twice and lysed with 10mM Tris HCl containing 0.2%
Triton X100 and the fluorescence at 485/535 nm was
measured. Candidate genes displaying a direct effect on
the siRNAs only in MCF-7/P-gp(+) and not in MCF-7/Pgp(+)/CD44s(+) or MCF-7/P-gp(-)/CD44(-) cells, with the
highest p-value in three independent primary screens were
considered as potential hits. The validation of the potential
hits was done by transfecting the respective individual
siRNAs of each candidate in MCF-7/P-gp(+) and MCF7/P-gp(+)/CD44s(+) cells and testing for increased drug
export (ie, less intracellular calcein AM).

Ubiquitination and degradation assays
Protein extracts and membrane fractions were
prepared as previously described [41]. The turnover of
P-gp was assayed by addition of cycloheximide to cultures
and subsequent immunoblotting as previously described
[42].
In vivo degradation of P-gp was performed in the
yeast strain expressing P-gp, CD44 and YEp105 which
has a c-myc-tagged ubiquitin under the control of CUP1
promoter. Cultures grown overnight in the selective drop
out medium in the presence and absence of CuSO4 were
harvested in the mid exponential phase and tested for P-gp
degradation [39]. The proteasomal degradation of P-gp
was measured both in NIH3T3 cells using a temperaturesensitive proteasome mutant, and in a yeast strain with
a conditional cim5-1 mutant, cotransfected with MDR1
and CD44 and its phosphorylation mutants [17, 38].
Cycloheximide chase analysis was carried out on MCF-7/
BC19, MCF-7/Adr and in yeast strains.
In vivo ubiquitination was studied in HEK293T
cells co-transfected with His-tagged MDR1, CD44 and its
phosphorylation defective mutants along with HA-tagged
ubiquitin. After 48 hr transfection, the cells were harvested
and purified on Ni-NTA resin under denaturing conditions
and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with antiHA antibody as described [43]. For in vitro ubiquitination
assays, recombinant FLAG-P-gp was expressed in insect

antibody raised against a CD44 peptide incorporating
a phosphoserine residue at position 325 of CD44 was a
gift from C. Isacke. Cul1, Skp1, Roc1 plasmids were a
gift from R. Deshaies. FLAG-P-gp was a gift from K.
Linton. The retroviral vector pcDNA3.1 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to transduce the
human CD44s cDNA sequence into MCF-7/BC19 and
MCF-7/Adr cells. The EcoR1 digested fragment, which
includes the entire CD44s cDNA sequence was treated
with T4 DNA polymerase to produce a DNA fragment
with blunt ends. The same enzyme was used to fill-in
the ends of pcDNA3.1 linearized with Xba1, which was
then ligated to the CD44s cDNA insert using T4 DNA
ligase. This recombinant plasmid (named pcDNA3.1/
CD44s) sequence orientation was confirmed by restriction
digestion. pcDNA3.1 was then transfected into the
packing cell line PT67 (Clontech) as suggested by the
manufacturer. Supernatant from transfected PT67 culture
plates was collected from 24 to 72 hours after transfection.
About 5 X 105 cells were seeded in 100-mm plates, grown
overnight, and infected with virus-containing supernatant
from PT67 plates. Single colonies of stable transductants
were selected using G-418 for 1 to 2 weeks and transferred
to 24-well plates for another 1 to 2 weeks of incubation
in the presence of G-418. Cells clones that grew to
confluency were transferred to 6-well plates and then to
100-mm plates for the intended experimental use.

Statistical analysis

5.	

Student t-test was used for the analysis of the
siRNA library screening. We looked for siRNAs that
produced a significant reduction in intracellular calcein
AM fluorescence uptake on the MCF-7 P-gp(+)/CD44() cells, but not on MCF-7 P-gp(-)/CD44(-)or MCF-7
P-gp(+)/CD44(+) cells. To do this, we performed a onesided Student t-test by comparing the mean intracellular
fluorescence before and after the siRNA application on the
MCF-7 P-gp(+)/CD44(-) cells and filtering based on the
criterion that the fluorescence level had to be significantly
reduced (p < 0.05). We also ensured that the siRNA
did not significantly alter the fluorescence level for the
parental (MCF-7) and MCF-7 P-gp(+)/CD44(+) cell lines
by performing a two-sided t-test (p > 0.1). From this we
obtained a list of candidate siRNAs showing increasing
amounts of fluorescence being pumped out of the cell and,
therefore, potentially inhibiting P-gp degradation.
