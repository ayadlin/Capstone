ABSTRACT
Obesity has long been linked with prostate cancer progression, although the
underlying mechanism is still largely unknown. Here, we report that adipocytes
promote the enrichment of prostate cancer stem cells (CSCs) through a vicious cycle
of autocrine amplification. In the presence of adipocytes, prostate cancer cells actively
secrete the peptide hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which not only stimulates prostate
CSC self-renewal, but also induces cathepsin B (CTSB) production of the adipocytes.
In return, CTSB facilitates further CCK secretion by the cancer cells. More importantly,
inactivation of CCK receptor not only suppresses CTSB secretion by the adipocytes, but
also synergizes the inhibitory effect of CTSB inhibitor on adipocyte-promoted prostate
CSC self-renewal. In summary, we have uncovered a novel mechanism underlying the
mutual interplay between adipocytes and prostate CSCs, which may help explaining
the role of adipocytes in prostate cancer progression and provide opportunities for
effective intervention.

invasive characteristics and by their ability to self-renew
and differentiate into heterogeneous lineages of cancer
cells [7]. The unique plasticity of CSCs also allows them
to undergo the phenotypic switch known as the epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [8], which facilitates
the mobilization and homing of tumor cells to target
organs [9]. The stemness of CSCs is highly dependent on
the presence of a stem cell niche. Recent studies suggested
that CSCs are capable of creating their own niche by
recruiting mesenchymal stem cells or macrophages,
resulting in expansion of the CSC population within the
tumor microenvironment [10, 11]. The same process
is suggested to occur during the development of bone
metastasis, whereby disseminated prostate and breast
tumor cells with CSC properties have been found to
occupy the hematopoietic stem cell niche and hijacking
the signalling pathways within bone marrow [12-14].

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the second most common cause
of solid tumours in men worldwide [1]. Despite recent
advances in the detection of early prostate cancer, there
remains no effective therapy for patients with metastatic
disease [2]. The majority of patients with advanced
disease will respond initially to androgen ablation therapy.
However, 75-80% of them will go on to develop bone
metastasis and once the tumor established in the bone, the
disease is considered as incurable [3-5].
Tumor metastasis develops when cancer cells
disseminate into the circulation, colonize secondary
tissues and redevelop into bulk tumors [6]. Recent
evidence supports the idea that tumor metastasis originates
from a rare population of cancer cells known as cancer
stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are characterized by their highly

Therefore, identifying the key components of the CSC
niche that support prostate cancer metastasis may offer
opportunities for new treatment strategies.
Emerging data from recent studies support that
adipocytes play a key role in prostate tumor metastasis.
For example, obesity, which is associated with abnormal
growth and functions of adipocytes, has been shown
to correlate strongly with tumor metastasis in prostate
cancer patients. Meanwhile, high-fat diet has also been
consistently shown to promote the development of
prostate tumor metastasis [15]. Furthermore, adipocytes
isolated from periprostatic adipose tissues were found
to induce invasiveness of prostate cancer cells [16].
Recently, adipocytes have also been reported to stimulate
the growth and aggressiveness of prostate cancer cell
through the production of a number of adipokines [17-20].
Considering that adipocyte lineage cells were found to
stimulate follicular stem cell expansion [21], it is possible
that adipocytes may promote prostate tumor metastasis by
contributing to the formation of a CSC niche within the
tumor microenvironment.
Here, we demonstrated the role of adipocytes in
supporting self-renewal of prostate CSCs. We found
that co-culturing of prostate cancer cells with adipocytes
resulted in CSC enrichment, which was associated
with upregulation of cholecystokinin (CCK), a peptide
hormone regulating fat digestion and satiety. CCK not
only functions as an autocrine factor to promote CSC selfrenewal, but also acts as a paracrine factor on adipocyte to
stimulate the secretion of the cysteine protease cathepsin
B (CTSB). Surprisingly, CCK secretion by the cancer
cells was found to be induced by CTSB, suggesting that
CCK and CTSB contribute to an autocrine/paracrine
amplification loop that mediates the mutual interplay
between prostate CSCs and adipocytes.

and RM1-BM (Suppl. Figure 1). Meanwhile, adipocytes
also significantly induced the formation of secondary
prostaspheres (Figure 1C&1D), further confirming the
effect of adipocytes on prostate CSC self-renewal ability.
Consistently, mouse bone marrow derived adipocytes
(OP9) and human SGBS adipocytes also promoted the
prostatsphere formation of TRAMP-C1 and PC-3 cells to
a similar extent respectively (Suppl. Figure 2 and data not
shown), suggesting that the CSC-promoting effect may
be common among adipocytes derived from different
origins.
To validate our findings, western blotting and
flow cytometry analysis of common CSC markers were
performed. As shown in Figure 1E, protein expression
of Notch1, CD49f, Sca-1 and Nanog in TRAMP-C1
cells was significantly upregulated after co-culturing
with adipocytes. Furthermore, the percentage of cells
expressing the two putative CSC markers CD49f and
Sca-1 was significantly upregulated after co-culturing
with adipocytes (Figure 1F). These results confirm that
adipocytes actively promote self-renewal of prostate
CSCs, leading to subsequent expansion of CSC
population, supporting the notion that adipose tissues
may contribute to a metastatic niche necessary for the
maintenance of prostate CSCs.

Adipocytes induce a CCK autocrine loop in
prostate CSCs
To understand the underlying mechanism that
drives the active self-renewal of prostate CSCs under
the co-culture conditions, cDNA microarray analysis
was performed to compare the gene expression profile
of TRAMP-C1 cells that grow alone or in the presence
of adipocytes. As expected, expression of a number of
known stemness factors such as ALDH1A1, GFI-1 or
ITGA2 were highly induced in TRAMP-C1 cells in the
presence of adipocytes (Figure 2A and Suppl. Figure
3). However, the gene that showed the highest level
of induction was found to encode the protein CCK
(Figure 2A and Suppl. Table 1), a peptide hormone
expresses mainly by the mucosal epithelium in response
to consumption of high-fat diet. Subsequent analysis
with Real time- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
and Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
confirmed that both CCK mRNA and protein secretion
were upregulated in prostate cancer cells in the presence
of adipocytes (Figure 2B&2C and Suppl. Figure 4).
Surprisingly, prostate cancer cell lines were found to
actively expressing the CCK receptor CCKBR (Figure
2D). Since activation of CCKBR has recently been
shown to promote the stemness of colon cancer cells
[22], it is possible that the induction of CCK expression
by adipocytes may lead to the activation of an autocrine
loop and as a result promote CSC self-renewal. Indeed,

RESULTS
Adipocytes promote prostate CSC self-renewal
In order to understand the mutual interplay between
adipocytes and prostate CSCs population, mouse prostate
cancer cell line (TRAMP-C1) was allowed to grow in
a non-adherent condition in the presence or absence
of adipocytes (derived from the mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line). Co-culturing with fully differentiated
adipocytes strongly induced the self-renewal ability of the
TRAMP-C1 cells, as evidenced by the drastic induction
of spheroid formation (1 vs 12) under co-culture
conditions (Figure 1A&1B). Apart from increasing the
number of prostaspheres formed, the size of individual
prostaspheres was also significantly increased in the
presence of adipocytes adipocytes (Figure 1B). Similarly,
adipocytes also promoted spheroid formation of three
other mouse prostate cancer cell lines TC1-T5, RM1

while CCK mRNA was expressed at low level in both
TRAMP-C1 and LNCaP cells, the corresponding bone
metastatic sublines (i.e. TC1-T5 and C42B), which are
enriched with CSC population (Suppl. Figure 5), were
both found to express higher level of CCK transcript
(Figure 2E). Meanwhile, treatment with human
recombinant CCK not only induced the expression of
CSC marker in TRAMP-C1 cells (Figure 2F), but also
promotes the formation of prostasphere by the cells
(Figure 2G), indicating the importance of CCK in
regulating prostate CSC self-renewal. To confirm our
findings, TRAMP-C1 cells were treated with a CCKBR
specific inhibitor (i.e. YM022). As shown in Figure 2H,
inhibition of CCKBR was found to suppress CSC marker
expression in TRAMP-C1 cells. More importantly,
CCKBR inhibition was found to suppress the promoting
effect of adipocytes on spheroid formation of the cancer
cells (Figure 2I), supporting that adipocytes stimulate

prostate CSC self-renewal by facilitating the activation
of the CCK/CCKBR autocrine loop.

CCK stimulates CTSB secretion of the
adipocytes
Since CCK has been shown to regulate the function
of adipocytes through activation of the CCKBR, we
therefore speculate that by actively secreting CCK,
prostate CSCs may also influence the co-cultured
adipocytes, possibly in a way that favour their selfrenewal ability. Indeed, mass spectrometry analysis of
the conditioned medium (CM) from adipocytes before
and after co-cultured with prostate CSCs revealed that the
cysteine protease CTSB, which plays an important role in
prostate cancer progression [23], was among the proteins
induced in adipocytes under the co-culture condition
(Figure 3A). Subsequent analysis of the CM with ELISA

paracrine amplification loop

further confirmed that CTSB secretion was upregulated
in adipocytes that have been co-cultured with prostate
CSCs (Figure 3B), although the mRNA level of CTSB
was not induced under the same condition (Figure 3C).
Similarly, CTSB secretion, but not the mRNA level (data
not shown), was induced in adipocytes that were treated
with recombinant CCK (Figure 3D). However, the effect
of the recombinant CCK was abolished in the presence of
YM022 (Figure 3E), confirming that CCK induced CTSB
through activation of the CCKBR.

One of the key functions of cathepsin protein
family is the regulation of peptide hormone release and
activation [24]. For example, CSTB has been shown to
promote the liberation of thorexine at the apical membrane
[25]. Meanwhile, cathepsin L1 was also found to induce
the processing of pro-CCK, leading to an increase in the
secretion of the active CCK [26]. Although CTSB has not

been reported to regulate CCK secretion, we found that
treatment of TRAMP-C1 cells with recombinant CTSB
resulted in significant upregulation of CCK level in the
conditioned medium (Figure 4A) without affecting CCK
mRNA levels (data not shown). Meanwhile, inhibition
of CTSB significantly suppressed CCK production by
the cancer cells, further supporting that CTSB regulates
CCK secretion (Figure 4B). Since CCK is also capable of
inducing CTSB production of adipocytes, we anticipated
that this autocrine/paracrine amplification loop may play
a key role in sustaining the adipocyte-promoted prostate
CSC self-renewal. Consistent with our hypothesis, the
promoting effect of adipocytes on prostasphere formation
was significantly suppressed in the presence of CTSB
inhibitor (CA-074ME) (Figure 4C). Meanwhile, CA074ME was found to significantly enhance the effect
of YM022 against prostasphere formation (Figure 4D).
These results clearly indicate the critical role of this

novel autocrine/paracrine loop in mediating the effect of
adipocytes on prostate CSC self-renewal Summarized in
Figure 4E.

DISCUSSION
The frequent invasion of local tumor into
periprostatic adipose tissues and the metastasis of
advanced tumors into the adipocyte-rich bone marrow
clearly suggest the importance of adipose tissues during
prostate cancer progression [27, 28]. What is not yet clear
is how prostate cancer cells interact with the adipocytes
to support their eventual expansion into metastatic tumor.
Here, we report for the first time that adipocytes actively
interplay with prostate CSCs through a novel autocrine/
paracrine amplification loop, leading to rapid enrichment
of the CSC population.

Similar to normal stem cells, the stemness of
prostate CSCs is highly dependent on the presence of a
stem cell niche [29]. The stromal cells within the primary
prostate tumor appear to play a key role in promoting the
tumorigenicity of the prostate cancer cells, as evidenced by
the ability of cancer associated fibroblasts in transforming
normal prostate epithelial cells [30]. Similarly, our
finding that adipocytes actively stimulate prostate CSC
self-renewal support the proposal that adipose tissues
may contribute to a metastatic niche necessary for the
maintenance of prostate CSCs. Since obesity is associated
with adipocyte dysfunction and abnormal adiposity, the
resulting enrichment of the metastatic niches (i.e. the
periprostatic adipose tissues and bone marrow fat) may in

turn contribute to the frequent tumor metastasis and poor
prognosis observed in obese prostate cancer patients [15].
The significant upregulation of CCK mRNA in
prostate cancer cells upon co-cultured with adipocytes
suggests that CCK is playing an important role in
mediating the effect of adipocytes on CSC self-renewal.
Expression of CCK was believed to be restricted to the
enteroendocrine cells and to specialized neurons within
the brain [31, 32]. It is therefore surprising that CCK and
its receptor were both found to be expressed by prostate
cancer cells. Our study therefore represents the first to
discover the autocrine function of CCK in the maintenance
of prostate CSCs. Exactly how CCK promotes the
stemness of prostate CSCs is still unclear, although the

binding and activation of CCKBR by gastrin, a hormone
peptide structurally related to CCK, was found to regulate
the proliferation of normal and malignant colon stem cells
through suppression of both BMP-2 and Id4 expression
[22]. Since CCK also binds to and activates CCKBR, it is
possible that CCK may act through the same downstream
signalling pathway.
Dietary fat is the major risk factor not only for
obesity, but also for prostate cancer progression [33,
34]. Intake of dietary fat is known to induce a rapid
upregulation of CCK expression by the enteroendocrine
cells within the intestine [35]. Therefore, long term high-fat
diet consumption is expected to result in chronic elevation
of serum CCK level. Indeed, in a recent study, mice that
consumed a high-fat diet were found to have ten fold higher
of serum CCK level when compared to the control group
[36]. In pancreatic cancer, CCK expression was also found
to associate with larger tumors and a higher incidence of
metastasis [36, 37]. Considering that prostate cancer cells
also express CCKBR and respond to CCK stimulation,
the effects of high-fat diet on prostate tumor progression
reported previously [38] may well be a consequence of
CCK elevation. Therefore, exposing the cancer cells to a
high lipid content (i.e. high-fat diet or co-culturing with
adipocytes) may promote the CCK-autocrine loop and
further driven the expansion of prostate CSCs.
It is worth noting that CCK not only regulates fat
and protein digestion, but also controls the level of satiety.
In an animal study, systemic administration of CCK
was found to induce anorexia [39]. Meanwhile, serum
CCK level was found to be significantly higher in older
individuals [40], and is suggested to contribute to agingassociated anorexia. Since we found that CCK expression
is highly upregulated in bone metastatic prostate cancer
cells, it is possible that CCK secreted by cancer cells may
contribute to the anorexia commonly found in advanced
stage cancer patients, although further examination of
serum CCK level in prostate cancer patients is needed to
confirm this hypothesis.
Our findings suggest that the secretion of CCK
by prostate CSCs may also play roles in modulating the
function of adipocytes, possibly in a way that further
facilitates CSC expansion. One of the key pieces of
evidence is the stimulation of CTSB secretion by the
adipocytes, which in turn further promotes the secretion
of CCK by the cancer cells. Our discovery of this
seemingly paracrine/autocrine amplification loop may
help in explaining the mutual interplay between prostate
cancer cells and adipocytes. More importantly, despite
the presence of adipocytes, disruption of this loop by
means of inactivating either CCK receptor or CTSB
can significantly inhibit prostate CSC expansion, clearly
demonstrating the therapeutic potential of this paracrine/
autocrine amplification loop for targeting CSC population.
In summary, we have identified a novel mechanism
that mediates the interaction between adipocytes and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

prostate cancer cells, which may offer opportunities for the
development of new treatment against metastatic prostate
cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Spheroid formation assay
The spheroid formation assay was modified from a
previously reported protocol [41, 42]. Briefly, cells were
harvested and counted using a Scepter™ Automated Cell
Counter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Four hundred
cells were added to each well of a 24-well ultra-low
attachment plates (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Adipocytes differentiated from the 3T3-L1 cells were
then added into a cell culture insert (0.4 μM) (Millipore)
placed inside the well. Cells were grown in DMEM/F12
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with
10 μg/mL insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), B27 (Invitrogen),
80 ng/mL EGF (Sigma-Aldrich) and 40 ng/mL basic
FGF (Invitrogen). The number of spheroids formed was
counted at Day 7 or at the end of the treatment. Each
experiment was performed in triplicate and was repeated
at least 3 times, with each data point represents the mean
and SD. Statistical difference was determined by Student’s
t test and was considered as significant if p < 0.05.

Western blot
Experimental procedures have been described
in our previous study [43]. Firstly, cell pellets were
collected and lysed with lysis buffer (Cell Signalling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) containing 100 µM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; Sigma-Aldrich).
The cell lysates were quantified using the Pierce™
BCAProtein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA) before loading onto a SDSpolyacrylamide gel. The resolved proteins were then
transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore) which
was then blocked with 10% skim milk in TBST-T buffer
at room temperature. After the blocking, the membrane
was probed with the indicated antibody for 1 hour at
room temperature prior to being washed with TBS-T. The
membrane was then incubated with the corresponding
secondary antibody for another hour at room temperature.
After washing with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated
with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP
Substrate (Millipore), and the signals were visualized
and quantified using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc™ XRS Gel
Documentation System.

Flow cytometry analysis
Experimental procedures have been described by the
manufacturer. Briefly, cells were collected, washed twice

resuspended in 50 μl of fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) buffer (0.02% sodium azide and 2%
FBS in PBS) before incubating with the fluorescent dyeconjugated antibodies at 4°C in the dark for 30 minutes.
After incubation, the cells were washed twice with PBS
and resuspended in 200 μl of FACS buffer, and the flow
cytometry analysis was performed using the BD™ LSR
II. The results were then analysed using the KALUZA
software.

were equilibrated to pH-8 with 50 mM NH4HCO3 and
subsequently dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile. Proteins
were extracted with 60% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid,
dried in a speed-vac and resuspended in 10 μL of 5% v/v
formic acid for LC-MS/MS.
Peptides were analyzed using a 1200 Series
nano HPLC and Chip-Cube Q-TOF 6510 (Agilent
Technologies). HPLC loading pump was set to 3% B, flow
rate of 4uL/min while analytical pump was set to 10%B
and flow rate of 0.3uL/min. Mass spectrometry data were
analysed using Spectrum Mill (Agilent, B.04.00.127)
search engine. Extracted data were searched against
Swiss-Prot Release 2012-01-25 database containing
534,242 sequence entries, with mouse species, fixed
cysteine carbamidomethylation and variable methionine
oxidation selected. Precursor and product mass tolerance
was set to +/- 20ppm and ±=/- 50ppm respectively. Protein
identification cut-offs were set to protein score > 11,
peptide score >10 and scored peak intensity > 60% [45].

Microarray analysis
TRAMP-C1 cells that were grown alone or cocultured with adipocyte were lysed for RNA extraction
with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD,
USA) following with the manufacturer’s instructions.
The resulting RNA was used for the generation of labeled
cDNA based on the protocol described earlier [44]. cDNA
was probed against the Mouse GE 44K v2 Microarray
G2519F-026655 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA) according to standard procedures, and the signals
were read by the Agilent scanner and analyzed with
Genespring software.

ELISA
To quantify CCK and CTSB secretion, conditioned
medium was collected and analysed using either the CCK
Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) or the
CTSB Mouse ELISA Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA)
following with manufacturer’s instructions. Signals were
detected using a LUMIstar OPTIMA Luminescence
Microplate Reader. All results were then normalised as
fold changes relative to the control.

Real time- polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen) and 2 μg of the resulting RNA was used
to synthesize cDNA using the SuperScript® III FirstStrand Synthesis Systems (Invitrogen) as described by the
manufacturer’s instruction manual. RT-PCR was carried
out with the ViiA™ 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Sense and anti-sense
primers specific for the genes of interest are listed in
Suppl. Table 2. The transcript level of ribosomal protein
L32 (RPL32) was used as an internal control. Note that,
standard curve was used to quantify the CCK transcript
level in human prostate cancer cell lines and transcript
level was normalised as number of copies.
