BACKGROUND: A high pretreatment b2-microglobulin (B2M) level is associated with inferior survival outcomes in patients with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, to the authors’ knowledge, the prognostic and predictive significance of changes in B2M during treatment have not been reported to date. METHODS: The authors analyzed 83 patients treated with ibrutinib-based regimens
(66 with recurrent/refractory disease) and 198 treatment-naive patients who were treated with combined fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) to characterize changes in B2M and their relationship with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: B2M rapidly
decreased during treatment with ibrutinib; on multivariable analysis, patients who received FCR (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 0.18-0.90 [P 5.027]) were less likely to have normalized B2M at 6 months than patients treated with ibrutinib. On
univariable analysis, normalization of B2M was associated with superior progression-free survival (PFS) from the 6-month landmark in
patients treated with ibrutinib-based regimens and FCR. On multivariable analysis, failure to achieve normalized B2M at 6 months of
treatment was associated with inferior PFS (hazard ratio, 16.9; 95% CI, 1.3-220.0 [P 5.031]) for patients treated with ibrutinib, after
adjusting for the effects of baseline B2M, stage of disease, fludarabine-refractory disease, and del(17p). In contrast, in patients treated
with FCR, negative minimal residual disease status in the bone marrow was the only variable found to be significantly associated with
superior PFS (hazard ratio, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.67 [P 5.004]). CONCLUSIONS: Normalization of B2M at 6 months in patients treated
with ibrutinib was found to be a useful predictor of subsequent PFS and may assist in clinical decision-making. Cancer 2016;122:565C 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
b2-microglobulin (B2M) is the invariant peptide noncovalently associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class
I molecule, which is expressed on the surface of all nucleated cells.1 Free B2M is found in bodily fluids under physiological
conditions due to shedding from cell surfaces or intracellular release.1,2 It correlates with disease stage and tumor burden
in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).3 In addition, among patients who initially do not have indications
for treatment, elevated B2M at the time of diagnosis is independently associated with a shorter time to first therapy.4 The
B2M level correlates with CLL protein synthesis5 and with markers of rapid proliferation such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase and clusters of differentiation 38 (CD38) and CD49d expression.4 Thus, a high B2M level in patients with earlystage disease may reflect the presence of a more “activated,” proliferative clone.6 When treatment is required, a high B2M
level is reported to be independently associated with shorter survival.7-11 In addition, high B2M levels may be associated
with immune dysfunction through an impaired ability to generate monocyte-derived dendritic cells.1 B2M is excreted
renally and may have improved predictive ability for the treatment-free interval in patients with early-stage CLL when

adjusted for the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).2
Although the initial B2M level is a well-established prognostic variable in patients with CLL, to the best of our
knowledge, correlations of patient outcomes with changes
in B2M during therapy have not been explored. In the
current study, we analyzed patients treated on investigational protocols at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center (MDACC) from 2008 through 2013 to
determine whether changes in B2M differed according to
treatment regimen and whether normalization of B2M
during treatment was predictive of or correlated with
outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients treated on investigational protocols at MDACC
between 2008 and 2013 with ibrutinib-based regimens
(either as monotherapy or in combination with rituximab
[IR] or bendamustine [IBR]) or the combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) were
included in these analyses, provided they had 3 months
of follow-up and had at least a baseline and 1 subsequent B2M measurement. Patients treated with FCR or
ibrutinib-based regimens were analyzed separately given
the differences in the 2 patient populations. The upper
limit of normal for B2M for the MDACC clinical laboratory was 2.3 mg/L. Follow-up B2M measurements were
not mandated in these studies and were performed
according to individual physician preference. All patients
provided informed consent and studies were conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The following variables were analyzed: baseline B2M, B2M at 6
months 6 3 months, lowest level of B2M achieved, and
time to B2M normalization or nadir from the initiation of
treatment. Patients treated with FCR had end-oftreatment analysis of minimal residual disease (MRD)
performed on bone marrow using standardized 4-color
flow cytometry with a sensitivity of 0.01%, as previously
described.12

variables were compared using the chi-square or Fisher
exact tests. Multivariable analysis (MVA) for dichotomous outcome variables was performed using logistic
regression. The probabilities of progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method13 and differences between groups
for each variable were assessed using the log-rank test.14
MVA for survival was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.15 Variables with a P value of < .15
on univariable analysis (UVA) were evaluated on MVA.
PFS was defined as the time from treatment initiation
until disease progression (according to International
Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia [iwCLL]
criteria16, next therapy, or death. Six patients treated with
ibrutinib and 4 patients treated with FCR who underwent
planned allogeneic stem cell transplantation while
responding to therapy were censored for PFS analyses
from the first day of the transplant conditioning but were
followed for OS. Landmark PFS and OS analyses were
performed from the time of the 6-month B2M measurement (63 months) to determine the prognostic significance of normalization of B2M at that time point. Not all
patients had B2M measurements performed between 3
and 9 months after the initiation of treatment. These
patients were included in descriptive analyses of changes in
B2M over time, but not in the landmark survival analyses.
Given the association between renal function and B2M,
we analyzed the association between estimated GFR
(eGFR) and the likelihood of B2M normalization and the
association between eGFR, PFS, and OS. eGFR was routinely calculated by our clinical laboratory according to
the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
Study equation, using serum creatinine, age, sex, and racial
background of the patient.17 A cutoff value of <60 mL/
min/1.73 m2, corresponding to chronic kidney disease of
stage 3, was used to define “abnormal” renal function.18

Statistical Analysis

Patient Characteristics

Statistical analyses were performed with SAS statistical
software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC), SPLUS software (version 8.2; TIBCO Software Inc, Palo
Alto, Calif), and GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, Calif). Descriptive statistics were used
to summarize patient characteristics. The Student t test
was used to compare continuous variables that were normally distributed and the Mann-Whitney U test or
Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare continuous variables that were nonnormally distributed. Dichotomous

There were sufficient B2M results and duration of followup for 83 patients treated with ibrutinib (35 of whom
were treated with ibrutinib monotherapy, 37 with IR, and
11 with IBR) and 198 patients treated with FCR for the
current analysis. Baseline characteristics according to
treatment group are shown in Table 1. The median duration of follow-up was 23.8 months (range, 5.5-45.1
months) for patients treated with ibrutinib and 41.5
months (range, 14.4-69.1 months) for patients treated
with FCR. Consistent with the finding that patients

Association Between Baseline B2M Level and

on UVA: Rai stage III to IV disease, bulky lymphadenopathy (lymph node  5 cm), del(17p), and eGFR < 60 mL/
min/1.73 m2. There was no association noted between
del(11q), IGHV mutation status, sex, or zeta-chainassociated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) expression and a
baseline B2M level  4.0 mg/L. On MVA, all 4 of the following characteristics remained independently associated
with a baseline B2M level  4.0 mg/L: del(17p) (OR,
2.27; 95% CI, 1.18-4.40 [P 5 .02]), eGFR < 60 mL/
min/1.73 m2 (OR, 4.87; 95% CI, 2.56-9.29 [P<.001]),
bulky adenopathy (OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 2.07-5.78
[P<.001]), and Rai stage III to IV disease (OR, 3.13;
95% CI, 1.87-5.24 [P<.001]).
Change in B2M and Absolute Lymphocyte
Count With Time

There was no correlation noted between pretreatment
B2M level and the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC). Despite the expected treatment-associated lymphocytosis,
which predictably occurred at the time of initiation of
ibrutinib therapy, there was a concurrent rapid reduction
in B2M. In contrast, treatment with FCR was associated
with a rapid reduction in the ALC, which preceded
changes in B2M (Fig. 1A). We compared changes in the
ALC and B2M over time in patients treated with ibrutinib
monotherapy or IR. A similar B2M reduction was
observed with each regimen, despite a much more rapid
reduction in the ALC occurring with IR. There were too
few measurements of B2M in patients treated with IBR to
analyze those patients separately (Fig. 1B).
Association Between Normalization of B2M
After 6 Months of Treatment and Baseline
Patient Characteristics

The baseline characteristics found on UVA to be associated with the likelihood of normalizing B2M (<2.4 mg/
L) at 6 months in patients treated with ibrutinib are
shown in Table 2. On MVA, age  65 years (OR, 0.07;
95% CI, 0.01-0.89 [P 5 .04]), baseline B2M  4.0 mg/L
(OR, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.0-0.11 [P 5 .001]), and
fludarabine-refractory disease (OR, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.00.28 [P 5 .008]) were all strongly associated with a lower
likelihood of normalizing B2M at 6 months of treatment.

Ibrutinib-based regimens produced a rapid reduction in B2M
despite persistent lymphocytosis. The median and interquartile range (IQR) are shown. The number of measurements at
each timepoint were as follows: for ibrutinib-based regimens:
baseline, 83; 3 months, 54; 6 months, 53; and 12 months, 52;
and for FCR: baseline, 198; 3 months, 103; 6 months, 100; and
12 months, 68. (B) The median B2M level and ALC over time
in patients treated with ibrutinib monotherapy or ibrutinib

ibrutinib plus rituximab: baseline, 37; 3 months, 36; 6 months,
35; and 12 months, 35.

all found to be significantly associated with a lower likelihood of normalizing B2M at 6 months.
On MVA, that included those baseline characteristics significantly associated with a likelihood of B2M normalization at 6 months, patients who received FCR (OR,
0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.90 [P 5 .027]) were less likely to
achieve normalized B2M levels at 6 months compared
with patients treated with ibrutinib (Table 4).

Association Between Normalization of B2M at 6
Months and Depth of Best Response

The overall response rate (ORR) for patients treated with
ibrutinib was 92.8%; 13.3% of patients achieved a complete remission (CR). This higher-than-expected CR rate
was due to a higher number of CRs in those patients
receiving IBR. There was no association noted between
normalization of B2M at 6 months and final response rate;
50% of patients who achieved a CR achieved a normalized
B2M level at 6 months compared with 49.1% of patients
who achieved a partial remission (P 5 .924). The ORR for
patients treated with FCR was 96.5%; 67.7% of patients
achieved a CR. In contrast to patients treated with ibrutinib, there was a significant association noted between
depth of response and B2M normalization in patients
treated with FCR; 54.4% of patients who achieved a CR
had normalized B2M at 6 months versus 35.6% of those
who achieved a partial remission (P 5 .035).

achieving negative bone marrow MRD status and normalization of B2M; approximately 53.6% of 84 patients who
were treated with FCR and who were negative for MRD
had a B2M level < 2.4 mg/L at 6 months, whereas 47.9%
of patients who were positive for MRD had a B2M level < 2.4 mg/L. There were 37 patients treated with FCR
who had simultaneous measurement of B2M (20 patients
after cycle 3 and 17 patients after cycle 6 of FCR) and
bone marrow MRD status by flow cytometry. Twentyfour patients who achieved negative MRD status in the

bone marrow still had elevated B2M at the time of MRD
assessment; the median B2M level was 2.8 mg/L (range,
1.5-6.9 mg/L) at the time the negative MRD status was
achieved. Of 24 patients with negative MRD status with
initially abnormal B2M, 14 individuals subsequently
achieved normalized B2M in the absence of salvage therapy at a median of 14 months after the initiation of treatment (range, 5-41 months).

Landmark analysis was performed to evaluate the association between B2M normalization at 6 months (63
months) and PFS. In patients treated with ibrutinib, normalization of B2M at 6 months was associated with superior PFS from the landmark point (median PFS of 22.3
months vs not reached [NR]; P 5 .042) (Fig. 2). The only
other baseline factor found to be associated with inferior
PFS on UVA in patients treated with ibrutinib was
fludarabine-refractory disease (median PFS, 15 months vs
NR; P 5 .009) (Fig. 2); there was a trend toward an inferior PFS in patients with del(17p) (median PFS, 22.2
months vs NR; P 5 .059) and baseline B2M  4.0 mg/L
(P 5 .054). MVA was performed including B2M normalization and fixed pretreatment characteristics demonstrated to be significantly associated with PFS on 6-month
landmark analysis. On MVA, only achievement of B2M
normalization at 6 months was found to be significantly
associated with PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 16.9; 95% CI,
1.3-220.0 [P 5 .031]); there was a trend toward an inferior PFS in patients with a baseline B2M level  4.0 mg/L
(HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01-1.13 [P 5 .064]) and del(17p)
(HR, 3.09; 95% CI, 0.71-13.28 [P 5 .13]).
In patients treated with FCR, normalization of B2M
at 6 months (63 months) was also found to be associated
with superior PFS (median PFS, 53.8 months vs NR;
P 5 .004) (Fig. 3). Pretreatment characteristics associated
with superior PFS from the 6-month landmark analysis
were baseline B2M level  4.0 mg/L (median PFS, 42.8
months vs NR; P<.001), del(17p) (median PFS, 38.5
months vs NR; P<.001), unmutated IGHV (median
PFS, 42.8 months vs NR; P<.001), ZAP70 expression
(median PFS, 44.6 months vs NR; P<.001), and negative
MRD status in bone marrow (median PFS, 44.1 months
vs NR; P<.001). However, on MVA, only negative MRD
status in the bone marrow was found to be significantly
associated with longer PFS (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.120.67 [P 5 .004]) (Fig. 3).
There was no significant difference with regard to
PFS noted among patients who were MRD negative compared with those who were MRD positive by B2M level at

positive and with a B2M level < 2.4 mg/L had a longer
PFS compared with those with a B2M level of  2.4 mg/L

Association Between Changes in B2M and OS

There was no significant difference in OS according to
normalization of B2M noted in patients treated with
ibrutinib-based regimens or FCR. However, in patients
treated with ibrutinib, fludarabine-refractory disease (median OS, 18.2 months vs NR; P 5 .001) and del(17p)
(median OS, 22.2 months vs NR; P 5 .02) were found to
be significantly associated with shorter OS. On MVA,
only fludarabine-refractory disease was significantly associated with OS (HR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.4-11.9 [P 5 .009]).

In patients treated with FCR, a baseline B2M level  4.0 mg/L (P 5 .009), del(17p) (median OS, 41.1 vs
NR; P 5 .0006), unmutated IGHV (P 5 .006), and failure to achieve MRD-negative status (P 5 .0097) were all
found to be significantly associated with inferior OS on
UVA. On MVA, only MRD-negative status was found to
be significantly associated with longer OS (HR, 0.28;
95% CI, 0.12-0.67 [P 5 .004]).
Timing of Increase in B2M and Disease
Recurrence

Patients who subsequently developed disease recurrence
were analyzed to determine whether an increase in B2M
(considered significant if increased by 20% of the nadir
level) was predictive of subsequent recurrence. An increase
in B2M was not found to reliably precede clinical disease
recurrence; more often, it occurred simultaneously with

appear to be a useful predictor of clinical disease recurrence (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Pretreatment characteristics significantly associated with
the risk of shorter PFS in patients treated with FCR were
previously described and include high pretreatment B2M
level, unmutated IGHV, del(17p), and a high baseline
ALC.10 Furthermore, del(17p), high B2M, and poor performance status were associated with shorter OS.10
Del(17p) was associated with a shorter PFS in patients
treated with ibrutinib, despite a similar ORR to patients
with non-del(17p) CLL.19 The significance of an elevated
pretreatment B2M level is well established. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to demonstrate the
Cancer

prognostic significance of B2M normalization during
therapy, particularly in patients treated with ibrutinib.
Ibrutinib is associated with transient lymphocytosis
at the initiation of treatment19,20; however, B2M fell rapidly within the first few months of treatment, despite the
associated lymphocytosis. Normalization of B2M was
achieved in patients treated with ibrutinib despite measurable persistent disease in the majority of patients. In fact,
patients treated with ibrutinib were more likely to achieve
normalization of B2M levels within 6 months of treatment than those treated with FCR, the majority of whom
had achieved CR by the 6-month time point. Patients
treated with FCR frequently were found to have persistently elevated B2M despite achieving a CR with MRDnegative bone marrow. In addition, normalization of
B2M may be delayed until many months after the completion of therapy in patients treated with FCR. To the
571

Original Article

best of our knowledge, the reasons for these differences
are not clear.
The majority of patients who achieved normalized
B2M during ibrutinib treatment still had significant residual disease (ie, had not achieved a CR). This raises the possibility that the reduction in B2M observed during
ibrutinib therapy may not be due solely to a reduction in
tumor burden. Instead, a potential hypothesis is that ibrutinib may reduce the production and/or shedding of B2M
into plasma from CLL cell surfaces, through an as-yet
uncharacterized mechanism.21
MRD-negative status after treatment with FCR is a
powerful predictor of longer survival outcomes.22,23
However, MRD assessment is not useful in patients
treated with ibrutinib given the low CR rate19 and the
very low rate of MRD-negative remission.24 The results of
the current study demonstrated that normalization of
B2M at 6 months of ibrutinib-based treatment was associated with superior PFS, independent of pretreatment
prognostic features. Thus, this simple tool may help in the
early identification of patients at greater risk of subsequent
disease progression.
In patients treated with FCR, in whom MRD assessment after treatment is a well-established method of identifying those patients at higher risk of progressive disease,
serial B2M measurement may provide additional information regarding the risk of progression in patients with
persistent disease in the bone marrow. Those patients
whose B2M normalized were found to have a superior
outcome compared with those with persistently elevated
B2M. Determination of whether B2M normalization has
similar prognostic relevance in MRD-negative patients after FCR treatment will require analysis of larger patient
groups.
There are some limitations to the current study.
First, B2M measurements were not prescribed in these
protocols and as such were not performed in all patients
or at identical time points. Second, the patient population
was heterogeneous; patients treated with FCR were
treatment-naive and had more favorable baseline characteristics and longer follow-up. In addition, the group
treated with ibrutinib consisted of both treatment-naive
patients and those with recurrent/refractory disease and
contained patients treated with both single-agent and
combination therapy. However, we believe the heterogeneity of the patients within the current study increased the
generalizability of its findings; normalization of B2M at 6
months after the initiation of treatment appears to be a robust predictor of PFS, and is independently associated
with PFS in patients treated with ibrutinib, regardless of
572

baseline B2M, other baseline prognostic markers, and
depth of response after treatment. Finally, the numbers of
patients in the current study were insufficient to stratify
analysis for important prognostic variables such as
del(17p). Treatment decisions in this group of patients
are complex, particularly the decision regarding whether
to proceed with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in
those responding to ibrutinib. The availability of a
dynamic marker of prognosis akin to MRD assessment
may assist in clinical decision-making.
