Physicians who are responsible for the delivery of systemic treatment in lung cancer should be aware of the potential
risk of drug-induced pulmonary toxicity (DIPT), because such toxicity may develop in the context of a multifactorial
clinical condition. First, most patients with lung cancer may suffer from other non-neoplastic, smoking-related lung
diseases, such as emphysema and chronic obstructive lung disease, which may generate pathologic changes in lung
parenchyma. In addition, lung cancer itself may worsen the respiratory function, inducing atelectasis and lymphangitic carcinomatosis. The superimposed iatrogenic damage may lead to respiratory failure and, sometimes, death. The
risk of DIPT from chemotherapeutic agents has been widely examined in the past; and, currently, the potential for
lung toxicity has been extended by the introduction of molecular targeted therapies. Because there are no univocal
criteria with which to recognize DIPT, the diagnosis often is made by exclusion; consequently, it is hard to establish
an early diagnosis. The objective of this review was to describe the major DIPTs associated with antineoplastic agents
against nonsmall cell lung cancer to help physicians with this difficult diagnostic challenge. Cancer 2011;117:3069–80.

Chemotherapeutic agents that are used against nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may induce pulmonary
toxicity (drug induced pulmonary toxicity [DIPT]). To date, the newly adopted, molecular-targeted therapies (epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antiangiogenetic agents), used either alone or in combination, have increased the potential for DIPT.1
The diagnosis of DIPT may be complicated, because its clinical, histologic, and radiologic findings are nonspecific.2
However, the identification of DIPT is crucial, because patients with NSCLC who are candidates for systemic therapy already may have compromised respiratory function caused by several pre-existing conditions. Most of patients with lung
cancer suffer from other non-neoplastic, smoking-related lung diseases (ie, emphysema, chronic obstructive lung disease),
which may generate pathologic changes in lung parenchyma; and lung cancer itself may worsen the respiratory function,
inducing atelectasis and lymphangitic carcinomatosis.
Moreover, in patients with early stage NSCLC, elective surgery leads to a loss of lung volume (parenchyma amputation) and to perioperative functional alterations (atelectasis, diaphragm dysfunctions, ventilatory depression, alterations in
pulmonary gas exchange, cough, and clearance of secretions). In this context, an assessment for the potential risk of DIPT
is advisable when choosing between neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy, and an early diagnosis of
DIPT is essential to avoid respiratory insufficiency during treatment. In addition, radiation therapy, which is indicated for
patients who have locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC, may induce acute and chronic changes in lung parenchyma,
especially if it is administered concomitantly with chemotherapy.
The objective of the current report was to review the different potential DIPTs related to NSCLC treatment. For
each of the commonly used drugs, we reviewed the available information about the incidence of DIPT, symptoms and
their onset, risk factors, radiologic and histologic patterns, therapy, and outcomes, and we propose a diagnostic algorithm
to aid clinicians in the early detection of DIPT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A bibliographic search of the literature available on
PubMed was performed. The selection criteria for the
search included the presence of DIPT for each of the antineoplastic agents used against NSCLC. We included
clinical trials, meta-analyses, and case reports to be as exhaustive as possible in the description of DIPT.
Published articles reporting on DIPT have used different clinical, radiologic, or histologic criteria for its definition. For the purpose of the current review, we defined
DIPT as any pulmonary complication that involved parenchyma, airways, or lung vessels and any systemic disease that involved the lung. The possible parenchymal

3070

patterns of DIPT are defined in Table 1 according to
symptoms and histologic and radiologic patterns. The
main features of clinical DIPT syndromes related to airways disease, lung vessels, and systemic diseases are summarized in Table 2.

2% of patients, whereas the reported incidence of other
DIPTs is not statistically significant. HRs related to platinum compounds generally are type I and can occur after
multiple cycles of chemotherapy. The symptoms associated with platinum compounds are urticaria, rush, angioedema, bronchospasm, and hypotension. The treatment
of severe HRs includes infusion interruption and the
administration of corticosteroids, antihistamines, and
epinephrine. In addition, treatment discontinuation is
recommended.3
Because platinum agents usually are coadministered
with other cytotoxic agents, it may be observed sporadically that some pulmonary adverse events related to platinum administration have been attributed to other drugs.
It was reported that the combination of gemcitabine plus
carboplatin, compared with gemcitabine alone, leads to
an increased risk of lung toxicity (13% vs 11% for grade
3/4 lung toxicity), and a role for carboplatin in this
increase cannot be excluded.4 In a phase 3 trial that compared gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus cisplatin alone, it
was reported that, in the cisplatin-alone arm, the incidence of grade 3 dyspnea was 3%, and the incidence of
grade 4 dyspnea was 2%.5 In both of those studies, the difference in incidence was not statistically significant.

Gemcitabine

The most frequent form of pulmonary toxicity
described for gemcitabine is dyspnea. Grade 4 dyspnea is
reported in approximately 3% of patients, and it can be
associated with bronchospasm in approximately 0.6% of
patients.5 Generally, dyspnea occurs within hours after
the administration of gemcitabine, and it is self-limiting.
Additional and rare gemcitabine-related pulmonary
toxicities include alveolar hemorrhage (AH),6 diffuse alveolar damage (DAD),7 acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS),8 noncardiogenic pulmonary edema,9 hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS),10 and capillary leak syndrome.11 A pooled analysis from a large database indicated that the incidence of severe gemcitabine-induced
pulmonary toxicity can vary from 0.02% to 0.27%.12
The onset of symptoms (dry cough, fatigue, malaise)
occurs 3 to 12 weeks after the beginning of treatment.13-15
The radiologic findings are represented by diffuse or
patchy ground-glass attenuation, reticular nodules, and
interstitial thickening.16 In most patients, the histologic
findings at autopsy reveal hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, patchy AH, hyaline membrane formation, and fibrosis,7,8,15 all findings that are consistent with acute lung
injury.
Potential risk factors have been identified in the
concomitant administration of other agents (paclitaxel,
docetaxel, ifosfamide, and granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor), previous lung disease, and chest radiation.6 In
an early clinical phase 2 study, thoracic radiotherapy (total
dose, 60 grays [Gy]) was administered concomitantly
with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 per week) to patients with
locally advanced NSCLC. That study was interrupted after the inclusion of 8 patients because of severe toxicity (3
patients died, 10%-20% died of pneumonitis, and 50%
died of esophagitis).17 Since that experience, other studies
have tried to assess the optimal dose of gemcitabine to
take advantage of its radiosensitization effect and to avoid
toxicity.18 The suggested dose of gemcitabine combined
with radiotherapy can vary from 100 mg/m2 to 375 mg/
m2 per week, depending on the radiotherapy dose, the
type of treatment planning (2-dimensional or 3-dimensional), and the radiation volume.19
The risk of gemcitabine-induced recall phenomenon is rare, although some instances of recall pneumonitis in patients who received previous radiation therapy
have been reported. Dry cough and dyspnea are early
symptoms, and ground-glass opacities in the irradiated
areas have been observed on computed tomography (CT)
scans. This risk of recall pneumonitis should be taken into

3071

account even after an extended time after previous radiotherapy (from weeks to months).20 Discontinuation of
therapy and the administration of corticosteroids (ie,
prednisone 60 mg daily) may improve DIPT within a few
days.21
Etoposide

dyspnea and bronchospasm, which can evolve clinically
into ARDS and may require intubation.32 Supportive
care, bronchodilators, and steroid administration normally improve dyspnea within days, although evolution
to chronic pulmonary insufficiency is common in these
patients.27,33 3) Pulmonary toxicity may be induced by
MMC-related HUS. Patients affected by HUS develop
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, noncardiogenic and pulmonary edema; and some patients develop AH with subsequent ARDS and respiratory
failure.34 This syndrome usually occurs late, often more
than 1 year after the beginning of treatment. The prognosis for these patients is poor despite intensive-care treatment,
high-dose
corticosteroid
therapy,
and
35
plasmapheresis.

Etoposide may induce HRs with angioedema, bronchospasm, and hypotension, all of which require steroid
administration.22 Interstitial lung disease (ILD) related to
etoposide is rare, but several case reports have been published.23 The clinical onset is characterized by nonspecific
symptoms, such as progressive dyspnea with severe hypoxemia, nonproductive cough, and, in some patients, fever,
which normally appears after a prolonged treatment but
may occur even after 1 week.
The features observed on chest x-ray and CT scans
include bilateral, diffuse interstitial and alveolar infiltrates; and, at lung biopsy, the predominant pattern is
represented by diffuse alveolar, septal, and parenchymal
fibrosis; DAD; focal hyaline membrane formation; AH;
and atypical bronchial epithelial hyperplasia.23 The concomitant administration of other drugs, such as methotrexate, or thoracic radiation therapy may increase the risk
of developing ILD.24

Vinca alkaloids rarely induce DIPT when administrated as single agents, but pulmonary toxicity is reported
in combination with MMC, as described above.36 The
only DIPTs that have been reported after administration
of single-agent vinorelbine are rare instances of acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), dyspnea, and bronchospasm
(within hours from the infusion). These DIPTs are usually responsive to bronchodilators and steroids.37

Mitomycin-C

Taxanes

Mitomycin-C (MMC) is no longer used for the
treatment of NSCLC; however, in some of the recently
published combined-modality trials in early stage
NSCLC that were initiated more than 15 years ago,
MMC still was part of triplet combinations.25,26 With
this agent, pulmonary toxicity may occur in 4% of
patients or even more, especially if its administration is
associated with other agents,27 such as vinca alkaloids,
platinum agents, and radiotherapy.28,29
Three different clinical patterns of toxicity may
occur: 1) chronic interstitial pneumonitis with fibrosis
(when MMC is administered alone or in combination
with radiotherapy and other agents).28 The onset of symptoms (progressive dyspnea, dry cough, and rare fever)
usually occurs 3 to 12 months after the beginning of treatment, but it also may occur after a single administration.29
This syndrome may respond promptly to drug discontinuation and corticosteroid administration but, in spite of
the treatment, it can also evolve to progressive pulmonary
insufficiency, as described in some patients.30,31 2) Acute
pneumonitis (typical of MMC combined with vinca alkaloids) is accompanied by a rapid onset (within hours) of

Paclitaxel is approved for the treatment of several
different cancers, including NSCLC. Initial clinical data
indicated that up to 30% of patients developed HRs;
however, this rate decreased to approximately 1% when
patients were premedicated with antihistamines and steroids.38 Unlike reactions to platinum compounds, nearly
95% of all reactions to taxanes occur during the first or
second cycle, and symptoms develop within the first 10
minutes of the infusion. The treatment of severe HRs
(characterized by dyspnea, hypoxemia, bronchospasm, urticaria, arterial hypotension, and erythematous rashes39)
includes administration of epinephrine, diphenhydramine, albuterol, and hydrocortisone as well as treatment
discontinuation.3
Paclitaxel-related interstitial pneumonitis occurs in
1% of patients, but its incidence increases if it is administered concomitantly with gemcitabine and radiotherapy.40,41 Symptoms are nonspecific (dry cough, dyspnea,
hypoxemia) and occur from hours to weeks after the infusion.6 An x-ray may reveal patchy infiltration and a reticulonodular pattern, and high-resolution CT (HRCT) can
reveal patchy areas with ground-glass opacities.42 The

histology is characterized by interstitial inflammation,
hyaline membrane formation, fibrosis, and abnormal type
II pneumocyte proliferation, which is suggestive of a
direct toxic effect, whereas the presence of eosinophils in
both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) supports
the hypothesis of a hypersensitivity pathogenesis.6,41,43
Most patients improve with drug discontinuation,
supportive care, and steroids, although fatal events have
been reported.6,41
HRs are less frequent with docetaxel than with paclitaxel, because docetaxel is dissolved in ethanol and water
rather than cremaphor. Docetaxel can induce fluid retention caused by capillary leakage as a consequence of the
induced damage to endothelial cells with consequent capillary hyperpermeability, leading to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, peripheral edema, pleural effusion, and
ascites.44 The incidence of this complication is 3% in
monotherapy and 23% in association with gemcitabine.
Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported after
docetaxel administration and can be suspected in the presence of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. On physical examination of the chest, fine, bilateral crackles can be detected
even in patients who have normal chest x-rays. Patients
with severe AIP and hypersensitivity pneumonia (HP)
with ARDS-like symptoms that occurred within 8 to 21
days after the last dose of docetaxel have been described:
symptoms develop acutely over 1 or 2 days and may progress rapidly to respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation.45 Docetaxel-induced pneumonitis
typically presents with a pattern like that observed in nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, and it is remarkable in its
long duration.6
The association of docetaxel with other chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy may increase the incidence
of grade 3/4 DIPT.46 Pneumonitis rates as high as 7% to
10% have been reported, especially during or after concurrent radiotherapy,47 and a rate as high as 23% was
reported with the coadministration of gemcitabine.48
Although mild pneumonitis tends to resolve spontaneously or after low doses of steroids,6 in severe cases, treatment discontinuation and the use of steroid therapy are
not always effective to avoid insufficiency and death.

Pemetrexed.

No significant pulmonary toxicity has been reported
for pemetrexed in phase 3 studies,49,50 and only sporadic
case reports have indicated the possible occurrence of
pemetrexed-related interstitial pneumonia.51

Pulmonary Toxicity of Targeted Therapies
Anti-EGFR therapies
Gefitinib

In 2 second-line, phase 2 studies that included more
than 400 patients who received gefitinib monotherapy, 2
patients experienced ILD-type events (interstitial pneumonia and pneumonitis).52,53 Both were Japanese
patients who received gefitinib 500 mg daily. One patient
recovered from DIPT after withdrawal from treatment. In
the other patient, the pneumonitis occurred 3 days after
withdrawal from gefitinib treatment (because of severe fatigue), and it was ongoing at the time the patient died of
disease progression. Two phase 3 trials (Iressa NSCLC
Trial Assessing Combination Treatment 1 [INTACT1]
and INTACT2) that compared gefitinib and placebo in
combination with standard chemotherapy as first-line
treatment of advanced NSCLC did not report any
increased lung toxicity in the gefitinib arm.54,55
In the Iressa Pan-Asia Study (IPASS study), carboplatin/paclitaxel was compared with gefitinib monotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced pulmonary
adenocarcinoma in nonsmokers and former light smokers. ILD events occurred in 16 of 609 patients who
received gefitinib (2.6%), including 3 fatal outcomes, and
in 8 of 608 patients who received carboplatin/paclitaxel
(1.4%), including 1 fatal outcome.56
A subsequent observational study that included
more than 185.000 patients who received gefitinib
reported an incidence of ILD of 1.5% to 2% among Japanese patients versus 0.3% in the rest of the world.57
Despite this low incidence, gefitinib-induced DIPT may
be fatal up to 30% of patients.58
Gefitinib-associated DIPT consists mainly of ILD:
AIP with DAD,59,60 AH,61 and pulmonary fibrosis62,63
have been reported. It usually occurs within the first 90
days of treatment,6 and the median time of clinical
onset was 24 days in Japan and 42 days in the United
States.58
In a Japanese multi-institutional study of 102
patients with gefitinib-induced ILD, the radiologic findings were classified into 4 patterns: 1) parenchymal areas
with ground-glass attenuation; 2) multifocal areas of
airspace consolidation; 3) patchy distribution of groundglass attenuation with associated interlobar septal
thickening; and 4) extensive, bilateral, ground-glass
attenuation or airspace consolidations with traction bronchiectasis.64 The first and the last patterns were the most
common (47.1% and 23.5%, respectively). The mortality
rate was significantly higher in patients who had pattern

number 4, which was consistent with the radiologic features of DAD.
Smoking and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported
as risk factors for developing gefitinib-induced DIPT,63
whereas it remains uncertain whether previous radiotherapy confers an increased risk. In some patients, even an
early diagnosis with discontinuation of therapy and treatment with corticosteroids may be ineffective,65 especially
in those patients who have pre-existing pulmonary
fibrosis.58,66
Erlotinib

Worldwide, the rate of erlotinib-induced lung toxicity is approximately 1%,67,68 although single-center studies have reported a higher incidence among Japanese
patients.69 In addition, in a retrospective Japanese study,
the occurrence of adverse reactions was observed earlier
with erlotinib than with gefitinib.70 The most common
pulmonary toxicity from erlotinib is acute or subacute
onset of dyspnea with rapid progression to respiratory failure and ARDS.71 CT findings reveal diffuse, ground-glass
opacities; and the classic DAD pattern has been described
histologically. In only 1 patient, a pattern similar to bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) was
reported.71
The risk factors for developing lung toxicity include
72
age, smoking history, and the concomitant administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy73; however, to
date, no conclusive evidence is available. Erlotinib-related
toxicity may be increased if it is combined with other
agents; in particular, some cases of ILD have been
described in association with gemcitabine.74
In 1 case report, the occurrence of lung toxicity secondary to erlotinib was observed in patients with preexisting usual interstitial pneumonia.75 On the basis of
existing data, patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis should not be excluded from receiving erlotinib; however, strict treatment monitoring is recommended for
such patients, and an accurate assessment of the lung parenchyma before starting treatment is strongly advised.
Cetuximab

Cetuximab-related lung toxicities include acute HR
and ILD. HRs after cetuximab administration are more
common than after gefitinib or erlotinib, whereas the
occurrence of ILD is less frequent.76 Overall. the results
from phase 2 studies have indicated that adding cetuximab to chemotherapy does not exacerbate the side effects
of platinum-based doublets.77

3074

A phase 3 trial that compared cisplatine/vinorelbine
with or without cetuximab in chemotherapy-naive
patients who had advanced EGFR-positive NSCLC
revealed grade 4 dyspnea and respiratory failure in 2% of
patients in the cetuximab arm versus 1% in the chemotherapy-alone arm without any increase in treatment
related-deaths.78 Grade 4 infusion reactions were
observed in < 1% of patients in the cetuximab arm,
whereas no HRs were reported in the chemotherapy arm.
In another phase 3 trial that compared the carboplatin/taxane doublet with or without cetuximab in patients
with advanced NSCLC, the authors did not report any
pulmonary toxicity. Drug-related grade 3 or 4 HRs that
led to therapy discontinuation occurred in 4.6% of
patients in the cetuximab arm versus 0.6% of patients in
the chemotherapy-alone arm.79
Occasionally, BOOP has been described in patients
who received cetuximab for the treatment of metastatic
colorectal cancer.80
Antiangiogenic therapies
Bevacizumab

The most common bevacizumab-related DIPTs are
hemoptysis and pulmonary hemorrhage.81,82 The occurrence of these events is associated most frequently with the
presence of tumor cavitation and with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.83 Pulmonary hemorrhage appears
to be associated with the presence of cavitation and with
centrally located tumors, although it remains unclear
whether histology alone is the main risk factor for bleeding or is a surrogate for other risk factors.84
In a phase 2 study, life-threatening or fatal hemoptysis occurred in 4 of 13 patients who had squamous histology versus 2 of 54 patients who had adenocarcinoma, and
the overall incidence of fatal pulmonary hemorrhage was
9.1%.84 This observation led to the exclusion of patients
who had squamous cell carcinoma, cavitation, or hemoptysis from receiving bevacizumab in the subsequent phase
3 studies. With these exclusion criteria, in a study that
evaluated the addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin and
paclitaxel, the incidence of life-threatening pulmonary
hemorrhage decreased to 1.9%, and the incidence of fatal
hemorrhage was 1.2%.81
In another phase 3 trial patients, with advanced,
nonsquamous NSCLC were assigned randomly to receive
either cisplatin/gemcitabine plus low-dose bevacizumab
(7.5 mg/kg), high-dose bevacizumab (15 mg/kg), or placebo.86 Grade 3 or greater pulmonary hemorrhage was
observed in 2 patients in the placebo arm (0.6%), 5

NSCLC Treatment and Lung Toxicity/Sanctis et al

patients in the low-dose bevacizumab arm (1.5%), and 3
patients in the high-dose bevacizumab arm (0.9%). Four
of those 10 events occurred in patients who had centrally
located tumors.85
The incidence of thromboembolic complications
reported for bevacizumab differs among studies84,86; in
the above-mentioned Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group 4599 trial, a risk for thrombosis/embolism of 5%
was reported in the bevacizumab arm versus 3% in the
control arm, and 1 death secondary to pulmonary embolism was documented in the bevacizumab arm.81 In the
cisplatin and gemcitabine study with either placebo or
bevacizumab, no increase in the incidence of arterial or venous thromboembolic events was reported.85
The concomitant risk of bleeding and thrombosis
can be explained by the endothelial perturbations induced
by the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor,
which causes abnormal apoptosis and loss of integrity of
endothelial cells (hemorrhage) and also a decrease in the
platelet inhibitors prostaglandin I-2 and nitric oxide
(thrombosis).86 Recently, a retrospective study in colorectal
cancer that investigated the prophylactic use of acetylsalycilic acid during treatment with bevacizumab indicated
that there was no increase in hemorrhagic risk.87 Further
assessments are needed to prove the efficacy of acetylsalycilic acid in reducing the risk of thrombosis in NSCLC
patients treated with bevacizumab.86

The efficacy and safety of multiple vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such
as sunitinib and sorafenib, still is under evaluation. In a
recent phase 3 study that compared the carboplatin/paclitaxel doublet alone or with sorafenib, no significant difference in the rates of dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, or
pulmonary hemorrhage were observed in either arm,
whereas only the risk of bleeding was significantly greater
in the sorafenib arm.88

DISCUSSION
Assessing the true incidence of DIPT is quite challenging
because of the complexity of its diagnosis and the limited
number of cases reported. A recent study assessed the incidence of severe DIPT in approximately 3% to 5% of
patients with lung cancer,89 but it rates as high as 10%
have been reported in studies of combined chemotherapy
and radiotherapy.1
Cancer

To add complexity, the incidence of pulmonary complications related to some agents can vary according to ethnicity, particularly for the incidence of diffuse ILD among
Japanese patients compared with the rest of the world after
treatment with EGFR inhibitors. The reasons for this significantly higher incidence among Japanese patients remain
unknown.90 Suggested risk factors for the development of
DIPT related to each agent are reported in Table 3.
The analysis of possible predictive factors for DIPT
suggests that vascular lung damage may be detected by
increased plasma levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE). This hypothesis is based on the finding that ACE is
localized on the plasma membrane of pulmonary endothelial cells, and, when the membrane is damaged, ACE may
be released into circulation. However, experiments on animals that were exposed to pneumotoxic agents (ie, paraquat, bleomycin) revealed inconsistent patterns of serum
changes in ACE levels91; thus, at the moment, ACE cannot
be considered a valid predictive factor of DIPT.

There also are conflicting data about the value of the
serial assessment of diffusing lung capacity (DLCO) during
chemotherapy: On 1 hand, it offers the opportunity of an
early diagnosis and an early withdrawal of the antineoplastic agent; whereas, conversely, it has been noted that a
decrease in the DLCO value it rarely correlated to clinically
relevant lung disease, and it may improve at the end of the
chemotherapy.92 The relatively small number of studies
and these contrasting results do not validate the use of
DLCO measurements for predicting DIPT, and further
prospective studies are needed to establish their reliability.
Symptoms often are nonspecific, including dry
cough, dyspnea, fever, and chest pain. In patients with
immunosuppression secondary to chemotherapy, a differential diagnosis should be made with viral, bacterial, and
fungal pneumonia and also with cancer progression, radiation-related injury, cardiovascular causes (fluid overload,
heart failure), pulmonary embolism, idiopathic interstitial
pneumonia, and collagen vascular disease.93
The onset of symptoms sometimes is acute (immediately after drug administration) and may help in suspecting DIPT; however, the onset often may be delayed
and may be related mainly to the total cumulative dose of
the administered agent. This should be taken into account
to avoid the risk of underestimating the possibility of
DIPT. In most cases, HR and hypersensitivity-like
inflammatory interstitial pneumonias have an early onset
(days to weeks), whereas interstitial pneumonitis with
fibrosis has a late-stage occurrence (months to years).
At the time when a patient is becoming symptomatic, a chest x-ray may be negative (ie, docetaxel); and,
in these patients, a thoracic HRCT is highly recommended to make an early diagnosis of DIPT because of its
greater sensitivity for detecting parenchymal abnormalities.94 When diffuse parenchymal lung disease is suspected, the use of clinical criteria and HRCT has a
sensitivity of 72% to 77%, whereas its specificity is higher
(72%-84%) as a result of the ability to exclude other diseases.95 In 1 study that compared the efficacy of HRCT
versus chest-x-rays in detecting DIPT, abnormal findings
were detected in 74% of patients on chest x-rays and in
100% of patients on HRCT scans.96
However, because clinical and radiologic criteria are
not always sufficient to diagnose DIPT, further investigations are needed to make a differential diagnosis. Blood
cultures, sputum analysis, and urinalysis are recommended to exclude infections; echocardiography, blood
natriuretic peptide levels, and response to diuretics can
assess the cardiac origin of pulmonary edema.95

In this context, the histologic findings, even if they
are not always conclusive, can help the clinician to exclude
other pathologic conditions (ie, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, vasculitis, pneumonia) and to support the diagnosis. A
definitive diagnosis can be reached with lung biopsy, but
this approach is not always possible, because it depends on

the general conditions of the patient and on the invasiveness of the procedure. The clinical utility of fiberoptic
bronchoscopy with BAL and transbronchial lung biopsy
remains to be determined; however, it is less risky, and it
may allow the collection of useful information. In particular, BAL can assess the presence of infections, malignant
cells (suggestive of lymphangitic carcinomatosis), and AH.
A single antineoplastic agent can generate different
clinical, radiologic, and histologic patterns of DIPT, as
reported on Table 4, and ILD represents the most frequent complication (70%).90 Once other etiologies are
excluded, and when radiologic and histologic findings are
suggestive, the probability of DIPT is very high. The identification of the drug that caused the toxicity is sometimes
complicated by the coadministration of multiple agents,
sometimes concomitant with radiotherapy; thus, it can be
hard to detect the specific agent that is responsible for
DIPT. Moreover, in some patients, the association of 2
drugs enhances the pulmonary toxicity of the single agent
(ie, paclitaxel, vinca alkaloids).
Readministration of the suspected drug with recurrence of symptoms may be the only potential approach to
establish a diagnosis, but it is not recommended, because
it can induce severe DIPT. In these patients, the recommendation is to withhold all antineoplastic drugs that
have the potential for lung toxicity.
There are no recommended guidelines for the treatment of DIPT, and the usual approach consists of withdrawal of the suspected drug and the prompt
administration of high-dose of corticosteroids. For less
severe cases of pneumonitis, the administration of methylprednisolone 60 mg every 6 hours has been proposed;
however, if severe respiratory failure occurs, then methylprednisolone 1 g daily commonly is given for 3 days with
gradual dose reduction.97,98 In patients with HR who have

Cancer

hypoxia, hypotension, and circulatory collapse, mechanical ventilation, bronchodilators, epinephrine, vasopressors,
and intravenous fluid administration are indicated.3,6 The
response to corticosteroids is the key to confirming the suspected diagnosis of DIPT, although even this treatment
sometimes is not sufficient to avoid progressive pulmonary
impairment or death (ie, mitomycin, docetaxel).
In conclusion, there is no single diagnostic procedure that can result in a clear diagnosis of DIPT. A relatively high level of clinical suspicion may be obtained
when all results from clinical assessment and instrumental
diagnostic procedures are globally considered, because
DIPT is a diagnosis of exclusion. To help clinicians with
this challenge, we propose a ‘‘step-by-step’’ diagnostic
procedure (Table 5). Scientifically recognized databases of
DIPT already are available on the web (ie, www.pneumotox.fr accessed September 2010) and represent a useful
diagnostic tool for the clinician, especially if online
updates are pursued consistently.
