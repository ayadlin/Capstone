ABSTRACT
HER2-overexpression in tumor tissue is observed in 6 to 23% of advanced gastric
cancer (GC) cases, and trastuzumab is an active molecular drug for these patients.
There are no data available on whether serum levels of ligands are associated with
the response and resistance to trastuzumab in HER2-positive patients with metastatic
GC. HER2 screening of 502 patients with advanced gastric cancer was performed in
our institution. Among these patients, 84 patients (16.8%) were diagnosed as HER2positive, and those who were treated with trastuzumab and met the inclusion criteria
were enrolled in the present study. Serum levels of ligands that affect the HER2 signal
pathway were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Forty-six HER2positive patients were enrolled in this study, and 26 patients (56.5%) achieved a
partial response to treatment with trastuzumab. Among several ligands, the serum
level of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was significantly lower in responders
compared with that in non-responders (p = 0.014). Multivariate analyses showed
that a high level of serum HGF was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival
(OS) compared with low levels of HGF (adjusted HR: 3.857, 95% CI: 1.309–11.361,
p = 0.014). Among 25 patients without initial disease progression on the treatment
with trastuzumab, the mean value of serum HGF at disease progression was
significantly higher than that at pre-treatment (p = 0.041). As novel findings, our
study indicated that serum level of HGF was associated with tumor shrinkage and
time to progression of trastuzumab in HER2-positive patients with metastatic GC.

INTRODUCTION

high frequency of recurrence and distant metastasis [2].
Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)
belongs to the human epidermal growth factor receptor
family encoded by a gene located on the long arm of
chromosome 17 [3]. The frequency of HER2 amplification
in patients with gastric cancer was previously reported
as 6% to 23% [4–6]. Several retrospective studies have
reported that HER2 positivity is a prognostic factor
associated with increased risk of invasion, metastasis,

Gastric cancer (GC) is a common cancer and
a leading cause of death from cancer in the East Asian
countries [1]. Survival of patients with metastatic GC has
been moderately improved because new molecular target
drugs have been developed during the last decades. On
the other hand, many patients are often diagnosed at an
advanced stage which there is a poor prognosis due to the

and worse survival [7–9]. Trastuzumab is a humanized
monoclonal antibody that induces antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity and inhibits HER2-mediated
signaling and prevents cleavage of the extracellular
domain of HER2. The ToGA trial revealed that addition of
trastuzumab to a fluoropyrimidine plus cisplatin regimen as
first-line chemotherapy improved outcomes compared with
chemotherapy alone in HER2-positive patients with gastric
or gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma
[10]. Furthermore, phase II trials of oral S-1 plus cisplatin
with trastuzumab as first-line chemotherapy and a
combination of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab as secondline chemotherapy in trastuzumab naïve patients with
HER2-positive metastatic GC were performed in Japan
[11, 12]. These studies showed promising outcomes and
well-tolerable profiles. International phase III trials of
HER2-target agents such as pertuzumab and trastuzumab
emtansine for HER2-positive patients with advanced
gastric or GEJ cancer are now in progress [13].
Ligands of transmembrane receptor tyrsine kinases
play important roles in cell proliferation, survival,
migration and differentiation in tumor cells. Ligands of
the HER family in humans comprise epidermal growth
factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha), heparin binding-EGF (HB-EGF), betacellulin,
amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), epigen and
neuregulin (NRG) [14]. Other than these ligands of the
HER family, up-regulation of the HGF/ MET pathways
has been described as potential mechanisms of signal
escape in solid tumors during molecular-target therapy
of EGFR or HER2 [15–18]. In breast cancer, activation
of HGF/MET/PI3K pathway drives tumor formation,
metastasis, and drug resistance because of the crosstalk
between MET and other oncogenic pathways [19].
Previous report indicated that HGF level is associated
with epithelial to mesenchymal transition in patients with
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and high level of serum
HGF were associated with low response to treatment
and poor prognosis in stage IV SCLC patients [20].
In addition, increasing signaling of the insulin growth
factor-1 (IGF-1)/ IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway was
previously reported as one of the mechanism of resistance
to trastuzumab in HER2-postive tumors [21–23]. Few
reports have investigated the role of ligands as biomarkers
in the treatment with trastuzumab in patients with
metastatic GC. In the present study, we evaluated the roles
of serum ligands in predicting the efficacy of and acquired
resistance to trastuzumab in HER2-positive patients with
metastatic GC.

the intestinal (71.7%) and diffuse types (28.3%). The
HER2 status comprised IHC 3+ (84.8%) and IHC2+/FISH
(15.2%). Thirty-one patients received some subsequent
treatment after failure of trastuzumab. The median number
of cycles of trastuzumab treatment was 6 (range: 2–28).
Six patients continued to receive the treatment with
trastuzumab at the time of analysis of the present study.
Serum samples from 46 patients were used
to measure the concentrations of ligands. The pretreatment serum levels of ligands are shown by graphical
representations in Figure 1. Serum levels of EREG,
NRG, HGF and IGF-1 were within detectable range of
ELISA for all patients. On the other hand, serum levels
of some samples of EGF (n = 8), TGF-alpha (n = 35)
and AREG (n = 26) were less than the lower limit of
the detectable range of ELISA. The median serum
levels of EGF, EREG, NRG, HGF and IGF-1 were 94.9
pg/ml (range: < 0.001 – 1167 pg/ml), 1,307.3 pg/ml
(791.2 – 3841.3 pg/ml), 95.9 ng/ml (20.1 – 347.6 ng/ml),
1,747.1 pg/ml (984.9 – 5340.7 pg/ml) and 96.6 ng/ml
(33.1 – 178.6 ng/ml), respectively. For evaluation of the
potential prognostic roles of these ligands, cut-off values
to divide into high and low levels of serum ligands were
determined as the median value for each ligand. Serum
levels of TGF-alpha (range: < 0.001 – 44.86 pg/ml) and
AREG (< 0.001 – 227.8 pg/ml) in more than half of
patients were less than the lower limits of the detectable
range. Therefore, cut-off values of serum TGF-alpha
and AREG were determined as the lower limits of the
measurable range.

Comparison of serum levels of ligands between
responders and non-responders
Among 46 of HER2-positive patients who were
enrolled in this study, 26 patients (56.5%) achieved PR
by the treatment with trastuzumab and these patients were
defined as responders. On the other hand, 12 patients
(26.1%) achieved SD, and 8 patients (17.4%) were
diagnosed as PD in the treatment with trastuzumab. These
patients were defined as non-responders. We compared
the serum levels of ligands between responders and nonresponders, and the results are shown in Figure 2. Among
several ligands, serum levels of HGF were significantly
lower in responders compared with non-responders
(p = 0.014). On the other hand, there were no significant
differences statistically in serum levels of other ligands
between responders and non-responders.

significantly associated with worse OS. Other serum
ligands were not significantly associated with survival
of HER2-positive patients treated with trastuzumab.
Multivariate analyses showed that peritoneal dissemination

HGF (HR: 3.857, 95%CI: 1.309–11.361, p = 0.014) were
significant prognostic factors in OS.
A comparison of patients’ backgrounds and
histological findings between subgroups of high/low levels
of serum HGF and EREG are shown in Supplementary
Material 3. There were no significant differences in patient
characteristics between subgroups of high/low levels of
serum HGF, but liver metastasis was frequently observed
in patients with high levels of serum HGF compared to
those with low levels of HGF. In terms of EREG, there
were no significant differences in patient characteristics
regardless of serum level of EREG, but peritoneal
dissemination was more frequently observed in patients
with high levels of serum EREG compared to those with
low EREG.

serum HGF was set at 2,422.3 pg/ml, and we divided the
patients into two groups, those with high HGF (n = 8) and
those with low HGF (n = 38). There were significant better
ORR in patients with low HGF compared to those with
high HGF (ORR: 65.8 vs 12.5%, p = 0.014). In the present
study, combinations of fluoropyrimidine and cisplatin with
trastuzumab as first-line chemotherapy and paclitaxel with
trastuzumab as second/third-line chemotherapy were the
main chemotherapeutic regimens. Among patients who
received fluoropyrimidine plus cisplatin with trastuzumab,
those with high levels of serum HGF had significantly
shorter PFS (median PFS: 1.1 months vs 7.5 months,
p = 0.002) and median OS (3.3 months vs 18.0 months,
p < 0.001) compared to those with low HGF. Among
patients receiving paclitaxel with trastuzumab, those
with high levels of serum HGF had significantly shorter
PFS (median PFS: 1.6 months vs 6.8 months, p = 0.03)
and median OS (21.2 months vs 2.6 months, p = 0.015)
compared to those with low HGF. These results are shown
in Figure 3.

order to evaluate the role of serum HGF in developing
resistance to trastuzumab. Among 25 patients who
achieved PR or SD as the initial response to treatment
with trastuzumab, the mean value of serum HGF at
progressive disease was significantly higher than that at
pre-treatment (2038.7 ± 793.6 pg/ml vs 1758.8 ± 536.9
pg/ml, p = 0.041). In addition, serum levels of HGF at
progressive disease were elevated from the pre-treatment
levels in 72% of HER2-positive patients. These results are
shown in Figure 4.

levels of HGF by HER2 expression were summarized
in Supplementary Data 4. The median of serum HGF by
HER2 expression were 1,089.6 pg/ml (IHC0, n = 23),
1,055.4 pg/ml (IHC1+, n = 12), 1,157.9 pg/ml (IHC2+,

pathway, PTEN loss, and FcγRIIIa polymorphisms as
immune mechanism of antibody-dependent cytotoxicity
[25–27]. To our knowledge, no reports have been
published that evaluate the clinical roles of serum levels
of ligands that activate the ErbB family, cMET and
IGF-1R pathways on the treatment with trastuzumab in
HER2-positive patients with metastatic GC. In metastatic
colorectal cancer, we previously investigated the clinical
role of serum ligands in predicting the prognosis of antiEGFR antibody treatment [28]. Similar to the result of the
present study, high levels of serum HGF was associated
with poor prognosis in KRAS wild-type patients with
metastatic colorectal cancer. This indicated that serum
HGF may be a potent marker to predict resistance to
molecular-target agents that inhibit the receptors tyrosine
kinase (RTKs) of the ErbB-family in gastrointestinal
cancers.
In the present study, we also evaluated the change
of the serum level of HGF at trastuzumab failure
during treatment to evaluate the role of serum HGF in
inducing acquired resistance to trastuzumab. The mean
value of the serum level of HGF at disease progression
was significantly higher than that at pre-treatment in
metastatic GC patients who were treated with trastuzumab.
As previous reports, Kyoury H et al [29] indicated that
physiological signals downstream from the HGF/Met
receptor synergize with ErbB2/Neu to enhance the

HGF. Among these patients, serum levels of HGF before
treatment in patients who achieved PR (mean: 979.7 pg/ml,
n = 7) were lower than those who achieved PD (mean:
1,634.0 pg/ml, n = 2).

DISCUSSION
We investigated whether serum levels of ligands
are associated with the efficacy of chemotherapy plus
trastuzumab in HER2-positive patients with metastatic
GC. As novel findings, a low level of serum HGF at
pretreatment was significantly associated with a positive
response to the treatment and a high level of serum
HGF was a poor prognostic factor on the treatment with
trastuzumab. At the failure of trastuzumab, serum level
of HGF was frequently elevated compared with that
at pretreatment. Other ligands were not significantly
associated with the response to the treatment with
trastuzumab or with the prognosis for the disease.
The mechanism of resistance to trastuzumab and
anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) have been
mainly investigated in breast cancer. Resistance to antiHER2 treatment is caused by genetic or environmental
alterations of receptors tyrosine kinase (RTKs) and
downstream signals such as enzymatic cleavage of HER2
extradomain (ECD), constitutive activation of p95HER2,
genetic alteration of the PI3K/AKT pathway and MARK

malignant phenotype, promoting the breakdown of cellcell junctions and enhanced cell invasion. Overexpression
and increased gene copy numbers of HGF and MET in
tumor tissues were associated with the resistance to and
failure of trastuzumab treatment in HER2-postive breast
cancer [30, 31]. These findings support that there is crosstalk of signal pathways between members of the ErbB
family and HGF/Met pathway on the treatment with
trastuzumab.
In our study, serum levels of HGF were different
by HER2 expression of gastric cancer tissues. This
indicated that activation of HGF/MET pathway may be
different between HER2-positive and HER2-negative
patients. Zhang et al. identified that some RTKs pathway
including HGF/MET pathway caused unresponsiveness
to HER2 inhibitor (lapatinib) by pre-clinical model of
gastric cancer [32]. In this study, adding HGF to lapatinib
treatment in MET-overexpressed HER2 gastric cancer
cells not only activated MET, but also led to restimulation
of downstream effectors AKT and ERK1/2 even in the
presence of lapatinib, although phosphorylation of HER2
and EGFR continued to be suppressed. Furthermore,
addition of MET inhibitor to treatment of lapatinib plus
HGF inhibited HGF-induced MET phosphorylation and
AKT, ERK1/2 activation. These findings demonstrated
that MET activation confers lapatinib resistance through
restimulating the MAPK and AKT signaling pathways
in MET/HER2 overexpressed gastric cancer cells. In
addition, MET/p-MET expression was significantly
observed in HER2-positive gastric cancer tissues.
Taken together, activation of HGF/MET pathway were
strongly associated with the resistance to HER2 inhibitor
and this mechanism were more frequently observed in
HER2-positve gastric cancer patients compared with
HER2 negative patients.
There is few report that described the relationship
between serum HGF and HER2 in gastric cancer. In
preclinical study, previous report indicated that HGF
activation of MET receptors rescued HER2-amplifed
gastric cancer cells from lapatinib-induced growth
inhibition by re-stimulating the downstream pathways and
restoring normal cell-cycle progression [33]. A report has
been published that evaluated the clinical roles of serum
HGF as a prognostic factor in advanced GC. Park do J
et al. measured serum levels of VEGF-A, HGF, fibroblast
growth factor 2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor
(EGF) and evaluated the prognostic role of these ligands
in advanced GC patients who underwent gastrectomy [34].
In this study, patients with high level of HGF had shorter
survival compared with those with low HGF by a log-rank
test, and serum HGF also was had positively correlated
with disease progression, stage and tumor metastasis.
Similar to overexpression or gene amplification of MET,
these findings support our results that HGF induce the
resistance to HER2-target drug in HER2-posotive gastric

In locally advanced gastric cancer, the prognostic
values of HGF/MET expression in tumor tissue has also
been investigated and found to be a poor prognostic factor
in patients who were treated by surgical resection or
chemotherapy [35–41]. The prevalence of amplification of
the MET gene was rare (less than 5%), and overexpression
(more than IHC2+) of MET protein in tumor tissues were
observed by IHC in 9–20% of advanced GC patients who
previously underwent gastrectomy. High expressions
of mRNA of HGF and MET in tumor tissues were also
associated with poor prognosis in advanced GC patients
who underwent gastrectomy [38]. It was concluded from
these studies that activation of the HGF/MET pathway in
tumor tissue plays significant roles in tumor progression
and prognosis of locally advanced GC.
Prognostic value of HER2 status in metastatic
GC patients was previously investigated worldwide.
In Western countries, previous reports evaluated the
prognostic role of HER2 status in patients who were
enrolled in first-line prospective trials [42]. HER2-positive
patients had longer survival compared with HER2negative patients, but multivariate analyses showed that
HER2 was not independently prognostic factor. In our
institution, prognostic role of HER2 status in metastatic
GC patients was previously evaluated [43, 44]. There was
no significant difference in OS between HER2-positve
patients and HER2-negative patients. These results
suggested that HER2 status was not a prognostic factor in
metastatic GC patients.
Therapeutic agents of the HGF/MET pathway, antiHGF or anti-MET antibodies such as rilotumumab and
onartuzumab have been developed for use in unresectable
GC patients. As potential predictive markers of moleculartarget therapy involving the HGF/MET pathway,
amplification and copy number of the MET gene, mRNA
expression of MET and HGF, and immunohistochemistry
(IHC) of HGF/c-MET have been investigated in GC. In a
randomized placebo-controlled phase II study, the efficacy
of the anti-HGF antibody rilotumumab was evaluated in
combination with platinum-based chemotherapy as firstline treatment in patients with advanced gastric or GEJ
adenocarcinoma [45]. The combination of rilotumumab
plus chemotherapy marginally improved both PFS and
OS in the intention-to-treat population. A MET-positive
subgroup (IHC ≥ 1+) achieved longer OS compared with
MET-negative patients by chemotherapy plus rilotumumab
(HR 0.29, p = 0.012). In contrast, there was no clinical
benefit of adding rilotumumab to chemotherapy in METnegative patients. According to this study, MET-positivity
by IHC in tumor tissues is considered a predictive marker
for efficacy of anti-HGF antibody in metastatic GC
patients. Recently, two large-scale randomized phase III
trials (RILOMET-1 study: rilotumumab, MetGastric study:
onarutuzumab) evaluated the efficacy of adding HGF/
MET inhibitor to first-line chemotherapy in MET-positive
patients with unresectable gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma

[46, 47]. Unfortunately, these drugs did not provide
additional efficacy to first-line chemotherapy in these
phase III trials. In a search for an explanation of the
negative results of HGF/MET inhibitors, it was considered
whether MET expression by IHC is a true indicator of the
efficacy of MET/HGF inhibitors and whether there is
heterogeneity of MET expression in GC tissues. Biomarker
analyses, including the MET expression in these phase III
trials, will clarify the role of MET expression by IHC,
and further research on other predictive markers of HGF/
MET inhibitors, including the serum level of HGF, are
required in advanced GC patients. In addition, positive
effect of low dose of rapamycin on survival of caner-prone
HER-2/neu mice have been reported [48]. Strategy to use
rapamycin in combination with anticancer drugs may be
better for HER2-overespressed patients with activation of
MET/PI3K pathway and mTOR signaling.
There is some limitations in the present study. First,
we excluded some unresectable HER2-positive patients
who were treated with trastuzumab. For example, those
whose serum samples were not stocked for performing
the ELISA and those without some tumor target lesions
and could not be evaluated for a response to the treatment
by RECIST criteria. Second, the sample size of HER2positive patients in the present study is small, so further
evaluation in larger-scale analyses of prospective study are
needed to confirm whether our findings are reproducible.
In conclusion, this is the first analysis to evaluate
the clinical roles of serum ligands in the treatment with
trastuzumab in HER2-positive patients with metastatic
GC. The serum level of HGF at pre-treatment is a potent
biomarker to predict the initial response to treatment
and prognosis on the treatment with trastuzumab in
HER2-positive GC patients. In addition, elevation of
the serum level of HGF at disease progression was
observed as acquired resistance in about three-quarters
of patients without early failure of trastuzumab. Timedependent changes of serum HGF during the treatment
with trastuzumab may provide significant information
in terms of an individual doctor’s decisions to select the
most appropriate treatment as personalized medicine and
the serum markers are less invasive compared with the
biopsy or surgical resection of tumor tissues for metastatic
stage of GC patients. Further larger-scale analyses of
prospective study are required to validate our findings of
the present study.

National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo. Among 504
patients who underwent HER2 screening, 84 patients
(16.7%) were diagnosed as HER2-positive. Finally, we
enrolled 46 HER2-positive patients in this study, and
the inclusion criteria was as follows: Histologically
confirmed as adenocarcinoma of gastric or GEJ cancer,
positive HER2 status, unresectable stage (stage IV or
recurrence), received treatment with trastuzumab (at
least 2 cycles), age ≥ 20 years Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0–2,
adequate hematological and organ functions, at least one
measurable target lesion, no metastasis to brain or central
nervous system, no concomitant cancer except for gastric
or GEJ adenocarcinoma, sufficient serum samples at pretreatment and patient’s consent to the use of clinical data
and materials. A summarizing diagram of the present study
is presented in Supplementary Material 1.
Blood samples in our study were obtained from
residual blood samples of previous laboratory tests.
Separated serum samples were immediately stored
at –20°C in the Biobank of the division of clinical
laboratories in the National Cancer Center Hospital until
use. We collected serum samples from these patients
within a month before initiation of the treatment with
trastuzumab. In addition, serum samples were collected
from 30 of 46 patients during progression of their
disease during trastuzumab treatment. Patients continued
to receive the treatment until disease progression or
intolerable toxicity from chemotherapy intervened. The
response to the treatment was evaluated by contrastenhanced CT every 2 to 3 months. This study was
undertaken after approval by the institutional review
boards.

Treatment with trastuzumab
All patients received trastuzumab in combination
with cytotoxic agents. Trastuzumab was administered
at 6 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 4 mg/kg every
3 weeks. Chemotherapeutic regimens with trastuzumab
were fluoropyrimidine plus cisplatin (n = 24, 52.2%),
monotherapy of S-1 (n = 2, 4.3%), paclitaxel (n = 20,
43.5%). Trastuzumab was administered in combination with
the following chemotherapy regimens: Fluoropyrimidine
plus cisplatin consisted of capecitabine plus cisplatin
(n = 15), S-1 plus cisplatin (n = 7) and 5-FU plus cisplatin
(n = 2). Twenty-five (54.3%) patients were treated as firstline chemotherapy, and 21 patients (45.7%) were treated as
second- or third-line chemotherapy. Schedules and doses
of cytotoxic agents of the chemotherapeutic regimens were
referred to in previous reports of clinical trials [4, 11, 12].
Dose reduction or drug withdrawal was appropriately
performed according to each doctor’s decision. There were
no restrictions of subsequent treatment after failure of the
treatment with trastuzumab.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and sample collection
Between August 2008 and August 2014, HER2
screening was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded samples from endoscopic biopsy or surgical

patients whose best response was a CR, a PR, or SD.
Response to treatment with trastuzumab was evaluated in
all patients who were enrolled in this study.
Prognostic analyses were performed in patients
who received fluoropyrimidine plus cisplatin with
trastuzumab and paclitaxel plus trastuzumab. Progressionfree survival (PFS) was defined as the interval from
initiation of trastuzumab to the occurrence of disease
progression or death without evidence of progression.
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval from
initiation of trastuzumab to death or last follow-up.
Survival curves for PFS and OS were estimated using the
Kaplan–Meier method, and differences were evaluated
with the log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a Cox
proportional hazards model. HRs of univariate analyses
were calculated by covariates of performance status (0
vs 1–2), gender (male vs female), age (younger vs older,
cut-off; median), primary site (proximal vs distal), stage
(stage IV vs recurrence), histological type (intestinal type
vs diffuse type), HER2 status (IHC2+/DISH+ vs IHC3+),
prior gastrectomy (yes vs no), number of metastatic sites
(1 vs 2 or more), peritoneal dissemination (yes vs no), liver
metastasis (yes vs no), treatment (fluoropyrimidine plus
cisplatin with trastuzumab as first-line chemotherapy vs
paclitaxel with trastuzumab as second-line chemotherapy),
serum levels of ligands (high vs low, cut-off level:
median). HRs of multivariate analyses were calculated by
covariates of treatment, serum level of ligands and patient
characteristics, which were calculated as p-value < 0.1 by
univariate analyses.
Differences in the distributions of two variables
were evaluated using Fisher exact test or χ2 test, as
appropriate. Differences in distributions of more than
two variables were evaluated by the Kruskal–Wallis
test. For continuous variables, differences of medians
between two groups were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney
U test and differences of mean values between two groups
were evaluated by the student t test in the present study.
Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis
was performed to determine the optimal cut-off values
for serum ligands as continuous variables. All tests were
two-sided and a p-value < 0.05 was defined as statistically
significant. We performed statistical analyses by SPSS
statistical software, version 19 (IBM, Tokyo, Japan).

Tumor specimens were taken by endoscopic
biopsy or from resected primary lesions and tested for
HER2 status with IHC (Hercep Test, Dako, Denmark);
expression of HER2 was evaluated using the criteria as
described in a previous report [24]. Pathological diagnosis
was confirmed by two pathologists. Pathologist Staining
for HER2 was graded on a scale of 0–3, with 0 = no
reactivity or membranous reactivity in 10% of cells;
1+ = faint/barely perceptible membranous reactivity in
10% of cells or reactivity detected in only part of the
cell membrane; 2+ = weak to moderate complete or
basolateral membranous reactivity in 10% of tumor cells;
and 3+ = strong complete or basolateral membranous
reactivity in 10% of tumor cells. In specimens with IHC
scores of 2+, DISH (Ventana INFORM HER2 Dual Color
ISH, Roche®) was also performed. HER2 IHC3+ or
IHC2 +/DISH-positive (HER2:CEP17 ratio 2) specimens
were defined as HER2-positive. The others were defined
as HER2 negative.

ELISA
We selected the ligands, such as EGF, TGF-alpha,
AREG, EREG, NRG, HGF and IGF-1, that had previously
been reported to be associated with activation or crosstalk of the downstream signal pathway of the ErbB family
in solid tumors. We used ELISA kits to measure serum
levels of ligands as follows: Human HGF Quantikine
ELISA Kit (DHG00, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA), Human epiregulin ELISA kit (CSB-EL007779HU,
CUSABIO, Wuhan, Hubei, China), Human amphiregulin
ELISA kit (E90006Hu, Uscn Life Science, Wuhan, Hubei,
China), Human EGF Quantikine ELISA kit (DEG00,
R & D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA), Human TGFalpha Quantikine ELISA kit (DTGA00, R & D System,
Minneapolis, MN, USA), Human Neureglin-1 ELISA
kit (CSB-E17153 h, CUSABIO, Wuhan, Hubei, China)
and Human IGF-1 Quantikine ELISA kit (DG00, R & D
System, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Protocols for ELISA of
these ligands are summarized in Supplementary Material
