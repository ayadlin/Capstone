Abstract
Ingenol-3-angelate (Ing3A), extracted from Euphorbia peplus, is currently in clinical trials for eradicating
basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ by topical application.
Although structurally related to phorbol esters and a protein kinase C activator, topical Ing3A, but not
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors derived from
PAM212 (mouse SCC) and B16 (mouse melanoma). Ing3A and PMA both induced acute neutrophilic inflammation on mouse skin, but only Ing3A caused subcutaneous hemorrhage and vascular damage. Both
Ing3A and PMA activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in epidermis, but Ing3A also
activated ERK1/2 in skin dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Pretreatment with topical cyclosporin A
(CsA), verapamil, or XR9576, modulators of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), prevented Ing3A-induced hemorrhage
but not neutrophil infiltration. CsA also impaired the anticancer activity of Ing3A, whereas the antiinflammatory dexamethasone did not. Ing3A, but not PMA, blocked photoaffinity labeling of human P-gp with
[125I]iodoaryazidoprazosin and inhibited P-gp–mediated drug resistance to HCT-15 cells. The intracellular
levels of Ing3A were significantly lower in P-gp–expressing cells, and treatment with XR9576 increased the
levels to those of cells that do not express P-gp, showing that Ing3A binds to and is transported by P-gp.
Taken together, our results suggest that P-gp–mediated absorptive transport, dermal penetration, and vascular damage contribute to the anticancer activity of Ing3A in vivo. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4509–19. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), primarily basal cell
carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), is
the most prevalent cancer in the Caucasian population.
Although rarely lethal in the northern hemisphere, in warmer climates or in immunosuppressed patients it can metastasize and cause death (1). Under all circumstances, its
treatment constitutes an important component of health
care costs. Traditionally, treatment for NMSC involves surgical intervention and consequent esthetic deformity due to
the common location on exposed surfaces on which these
sun-induced lesions are most frequently found. Treatments
for the much more prevalent precancerous actinic keratosis

skin neoplasms are often scarifying as well, adding to the
personal and financial expense associated with skin cancer
diagnosis and therapy. Thus, the discovery of nondeforming
but curative medical therapies is a high priority for these
conditions.
With advances in cutaneous biology research, understanding the molecular pathology of skin cancer development has
expanded. The cause of the great majority of BCC involves
alterations in components of the sonic hedgehog pathway
(2), and targeted drugs are in clinical trials (3). The mechanism for the less common but more aggressive SCC has been
more difficult to delineate, although considerable insight has
been achieved (4).
The discovery that protein kinase C (PKC) δ was a proximal regulator of keratinocyte viability (5) and was catalytically inactivated or downregulated in cutaneous squamous
cell tumors presented a druggable target for tumor therapy
(6–9). Ingenol-3-angelate (Ing3A), an active component
extracted from Euphorbia peplus, is a PKC agonist with selectivity for PKCδ (10–12). This molecule had been reported to
be a strong irritant but has weak tumor-promoting activity
for mouse skin (13). Ing3A has antitumor activity when applied topically on mouse skin overlying subcutaneous mouse
and human tumor xenografts (14). A mechanism whereby
topical skin treatment could inhibit subcutaneous tumor
growth was unclear, but the compound has been pursued

as a potential skin cancer treatment by Peplin, Inc. (drug
name, PEP005) and is now in clinical trials with promising
results (15). Topical Ing3A elicits a strong inflammatory response subcutaneously, and the subsequent tumor killing
was considered a necrotic response to a marked microenvironmental inflammation (16).
Ing3A is structurally similar to phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (PMA), the classic mouse skin tumor promoter,
and elicits similar responses as PMA in cultured human cancer cells and isolated cell membranes or lipid vesicles (12).
Because the two compounds have not been tested side by
side in vivo, and PMA is equally proinflammatory, we focused
on defining a unique activity of Ing3A that may contribute to
its antitumor properties. We now show that Ing3A, like PMA,
engages the epidermis but then traverses through the epidermis by absorptive transport as a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate and reaches the subepidermal and subcutaneous
environment to engage and damage the tumor vasculature.
This property is essential to its antitumor activity and provides a novel paradigm for cutaneous drug therapy.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and antibodies
Ing3A was kindly provided by Peplin. PMA and cyclosporin
A (CsA) were purchased from LC Laboratories. Dexamethasone, indomethacin, and verapamil were purchased from
Sigma. XR9576 (tariquidar) was a gift of Xenova Research.
Anti-PKCα, PKCδ, PKCε, PKC-pan, and mitogen-activated
protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase
(MEK) 1/2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Anti-phospho–PKC-pan (P-PKC-pan), phospho-PKCδ

Tumor grafts and topical treatment of mice
Athymic NCr-nu/nu and BALB/cAnNCr-nu/nu mice were
obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI)–Frederick
(Frederick, MD), and SKH1 mice were purchased from
Charles River Laboratory. PAM212 tumors were established
by s.c. injection of 5 million cells on the flank of the BALB/
cAnNCr-nu/nu mice. B16 tumors were obtained by s.c. injection of 250,000 cells on the flank of athymic NCr-nu/nu mice.
For topical treatment of the mice, Ing3A, PMA, or other
reagents were dissolved in acetone. All mouse experiments
were performed under a protocol approved by the NCI
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Immunoblotting
Cell lysates were collected in lysis buffer from Cell Signaling and then processed for immunoblotting. For detection of
mdr1 in mouse skin and liver and human skin equivalents,
the frozen tissues were first mechanically disrupted; placed
into a buffer containing 25 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150
mmol/L NaCl, 250 mmol/L sucrose, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
1 mmol/L EGTA, and 100 μmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and then sonicated. The particulate fractions of the tissue extracts were isolated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g
for 1 hour and then subjected to immunoblotting using anti–
P-gp antibody. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated goat antirabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies were used as secondary
antibodies (Cell Signaling). The immunoblots were visualized
by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).
Multiplex bead array assay for cytokines/chemokines
Skin samples were collected from mice after treatment
and then homogenized in PBS. The supernatants were
collected after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 minutes.
The level of multiple cytokines/chemokines in the skin extracts was detected using a multiplex kit (Mouse Cytokine/
Chemokine 22 Plex kit, Linco) according to the manufacturer's instruction and carried out using BioPlex (Bio-Rad).
Reverse transcription-PCR
The expression of mouse tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)
RNA by PAM212 cells was detected by reverse transcription
followed by PCR using primers described previously (22). The
PCR products were resolved by 2% agarose gel. The expression of the mouse mdr1 transcript Abcba1a (primer set from
SuperArray) from the skin and liver of nude mice and human
ABCB1 from skin equivalents was detected by reverse transcription followed by quantitative competitive reverse transcription-PCR (Bio-Rad) and normalized to the level of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in each sample.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Tissue samples were fixed in 4% formalin (Fisher, Inc.).
Tissue sections were stained with H&E. Immunohistochemistry for myeloperoxidase (Dako), CD31 (PECAM-1; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), CD3 (Dako), F4/80 (Caltag), and
CD45R/B220 (BD) was performed to detect neutrophils, endothelial cells, T lymphocytes, macrophages, and B lymphocytes, respectively.

Transport of Ing3A by P-gp Targets Vasculature

Labeling and detection of vasculature in mouse skin
To reveal the blood vessels in mouse skin, control or treated
mice were anesthetized and then injected with FITC-lectin
(Vector Laboratories) via tail vein. After 2 minutes, the mice
were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde via the left ventricle
(23). Skin sections (100 μm) were mounted with mounting
medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector
Laboratories) for visualization by confocal microscopy (Zeiss
NLO510). A series of images were taken and projected in three
dimensions using ZeissLSM Image Browser.

Briefly, crude membranes from Hifive cells overexpressing human P-gp were incubated with Ing3A, PMA, or CsA for 5 minutes, after which 3 to 5 nmol/L [125I]iodoaryazidoprazosin
(IAAP; 2,200 Ci/mmol; Perkin-Elmer) in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5) was added. After exposure to UV light for 10 minutes
at room temperature, the samples were separated by electrophoresis, followed by drying and exposing to Bio-Max MR film
(Eastman-Kodak). Alternatively, the dried gel was scanned by
STORM 860 phosphor-imager system (Molecular Dynamics)
and then quantified by the ImageQuant software.

Photolabeling of P-gp with [125I]iodoaryazidoprazosin
The interaction of Ing3A with P-gp was assessed by an
in vitro photo labeling assay as previously described (24).

Efflux assay for P-gp–mediated transport
Inhibition of P-gp–mediated transport by Ing3A or PMA
was determined by flow cytometry using P-gp–expressing

and PMA activate PKC similarly in PAM212 cells, Ing3A is
more potent in eliciting those responses. Nevertheless, Ing3A
and PMA inhibited the growth of PAM212 cells at equivalent
doses (Supplementary Fig. S1D). These results indicate that
Ing3A, similar to PMA, activates a common PKC pathway in
both mouse skin and cultured mouse squamous cancer cells,
and both agents have similar direct effects on the cancer
cells.

Results
Ing3A activates PKC in mouse keratinocytes and
mouse skin
Ing3A directly binds and activates PKC in vitro (12). A single dose of 25 nmol of Ing3A or PMA applied topically onto
the back skin of nude mice induced phosphorylation of PKC
isoforms and MEK1/2 (Fig. 1A and B), suggesting that Ing3A,
like PMA, activates PKC in mouse skin. Figure 1C shows that
the induction of TNFα by both Ing3A and PMA was similar
in mouse skin. SCC in situ is one target for Ing3A therapy,
and Ing3A, similar to PMA, induced a rapid and dose-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2, PKC-pan, and PKCδ; downregulated PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCε; and elevated TNFα
transcripts in cultures of the mouse squamous cancer cell
line PAM212 (Supplementary Fig. S1A–C). Although Ing3A

Topical application of Ing3A induces cutaneous
inflammation and hemorrhage
The effects of Ing3A and PMA on the skin of nude mice,
the strain that has been the recipient of tumor xenografts in
preclinical studies, were compared. Three hours after initial
treatment, topical administration of Ing3A in either the clinical gel formulation or dissolved in acetone caused skin hemorrhage without actual breakage of the skin, but PMA did not
cause visible change in the treated area (Fig. 2A). H&E staining showed that Ing3A and PMA induced some common inflammatory changes, including edema and inflammatory cell
infiltration, by 3 to 6 hours, but only Ing3A induced red cell
extravasation in the dermis and subcutis of the skin (Fig. 2A).
Myeloperoxidase staining revealed that the predominant
infiltrating cells are neutrophils in both treatment groups

(Fig. 2B) as shown previously for Ing3A (16). Ing3A also induced subepidermal hemorrhage when applied to immunocompetent mice of the hairless SKH1 strain, indicating that
immunodeficiency was not responsible for the unique
response. Ing3A did not increase B lymphocyte, T lymphocyte, or macrophage infiltration in the skin of SKH1 mice
when examined at 5 hours after treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S2); however, both Ing3A and PMA activated mast cells
similarly (Supplementary Fig. S3). To investigate the pathways that mediate Ing3A-induced inflammatory responses
including the hemorrhage, various pathway specific inhibitors were tested by applying the inhibitors 15 to 30 minutes

before the application of Ing3A and examining the nude mice
5 hours later. As shown in Fig. 2C, dexamethasone and indomethacin successfully blocked Ing3A-induced neutrophil infiltration but not hemorrhage. Both dexamethasone and
indomethacin are known to inhibit PMA-induced inflammation and inflammatory mediators (25, 26). In contrast, CsA
blocked hemorrhage but not neutrophil infiltration in
Ing3A-treated mice. These results suggest that Ing3Ainduced hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration are
two independent events that are mediated by distinct pathways. In contrast, Ing3A- and PMA-induced inflammatory
cell infiltration is similar. A multiplex assay was used to

and 3). B, human skin equivalents were treated with Ing3A or PMA (25 nmol each) on the air surface for 30 min. Tissue sections were subjected to

determine the level of 22 cytokines/chemokines in skin extracts collected from mice treated with either Ing3A or
PMA. Eighteen of 21 detected cytokines/chemokines were
induced by both Ing3A and PMA treatment, and the induction of each cytokine/chemokine was similar by either inducer (Supplementary Table S1). These results indicate that a
unique pattern of Ing3A-induced cytokine/chemokine secretion in skin is not observed and could not be responsible for
Ing3A-induced hemorrhage.
Ing3A penetrates beyond the epidermis in skin and
damages blood vessels in vivo
We hypothesized that Ing3A-induced hemorrhage may be
caused by Ing3A directly targeting the blood vessels in the
skin. It has been reported previously that activation of
PKC in monolayer cultured endothelial cells induces endothelial cell activation but not cell death (27). To test Ing3A
in three-dimensional culture conditions, mouse 3B11 endothelial cells were plated on Matrigel, where they formed a
network of capillary-like structures composed of tubes and
branches (Fig. 3A). Addition of Ing3A or PMA caused disaggregation of the endothelial tube and outward migration of
single endothelial cells. Pretreatment with CsA did not block
the effect of Ing3A or PMA in vitro, suggesting that CsA does
not directly protect endothelial cells when Ing3A is applied
after CsA in vivo. Figure 3B shows FITC-lectin–labeled blood
vessels from control- and PMA-treated mice displayed continuous green fluorescence. However, loss of continuous
FITC-lectin staining in Ing3A-treated mice is detected
40 minutes after initial treatment, well before the appear-

ance of hemorrhage on the treated skin. To better visualize
the three-dimensional images of FITC-lectin–labeled blood
vessels, a surface rendering technique (Imaris 6.1 software)
was used. The reconstructed FITC-lectin–labeled vessels
are markedly damaged by Ing3A treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S4), leading to discontinuous patterns appearing as
“holes.” Damage was detected well into the deep dermis in
the large- or medium-sized blood vessels in the skin. Immunohistochemistry for CD31 expression and electron microscopy also revealed the loss of the structural integrity of
the cutaneous blood vessels after topical Ing3A treatment
(Fig. 3C). Disruption of basement membrane of venules, endothelial cell activation in arterioles, and loss of junctions
between endothelial cells were documented by electron microscopy (Fig. 3C; data not shown). Disrupted extracellular
matrix, RBC extravasation, and hemolysis in the blood vessels were also observed in skin from Ing3A-treated mice. Because Ing3A and PMA had similar effects on endothelial cell
tubes in vitro, we asked if PMA would mimic Ing3A if it were
delivered more directly to endothelial cells in skin. Hemorrhage was observed in mice injected s.c. with either Ing3A or
PMA as early as 1 to 3 hours (Supplementary Fig. S5). These
results indicate that skin hemorrhage could also be induced
by PMA if it is placed closer to the cutaneous blood vessels.
To test if topical Ing3A penetrates more deeply in skin than
PMA to reach the blood vessels in the dermis and subcutis,
P-ERK1/2 immunohistochemistry was performed on skin
sections obtained from nude mice treated topically with
either Ing3A or PMA. Figure 4A shows that phosphorylation
of ERK1/2 induced by Ing3A and PMA in epidermis occurs as

early as 30 minutes. In the dermis and subcutis of skin,
Ing3A induced P-ERK1/2 in fibroblasts and endothelial cells
to a much greater extent than PMA. Pretreatment with CsA
reduced Ing3A-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the dermis and subcutis of
skin but not in epidermis. These results suggest that, via a
CsA-dependent mechanism, Ing3A penetrates into the subepidermal compartment of skin rapidly and activates PKC
in multiple compartments, whereas PMA elicits most responses in the epidermis. Because mouse epidermis is relatively thin, we repeated these experiments by topically
treating human skin organotypic raft cultures that reproduce

the morphology of human skin, including a stratum corneum
(Fig. 4B). As seen for mouse skin in vivo, P-ERK1/2 was stimulated extensively in the reconstructed epidermis by both
PMA and Ing3A, but widespread and deep dermal fibroblast
stimulation was seen only with Ing3A.

with Ing3A, five tumors were either eliminated or reduced,
whereas two tumors were initially reduced and then had
resurgent growth between the two measurements. In contrast, the majority of acetone control–treated and PMAtreated PAM212 tumors maintained their size or showed
limited growth during the two measurement intervals on
days 13 and 23, whereas several showed enhanced growth
without treatment. Mice grafted with B16 cells were treated
3 days after injection of tumor cells, and tumor measurements were taken 10 days later due to the rapid growth
of B16 tumors. Ing3A treatment eliminated the B16 tumor
at five of the eight treated sites (Fig. 5B). In contrast,

Blocking neutrophil infiltration by dexamethasone had no
effect on Ing3A-induced tumor reduction. However, blocking hemorrhage by CsA partially reversed Ing3A-mediated
anticancer activity (Supplementary Table S2). B16 tumors
were also collected 1 or 5 days after initial Ing3A treatment.
As shown in Fig. 5C, 1 day after Ing3A treatment, severe
hemorrhage is observed at the tumor periphery. Tumor
cells in the upper part of the tumor are necrotic and blood
vessels are engorged with cells (Fig. 5C, b and insets B and
C), but cells in the deeper tumor mass (Fig. 5C, inset D)
seem viable. Five days after initial treatment, the entire tumor mass was necrotic (Fig. 5C, c and inset E). These results suggest that topical Ing3A treatment penetrates
through the epidermis into the dermis and subcutaneous

Transport of Ing3A by P-gp Targets Vasculature

region and initially targets blood vessel in the tumor periphery, eventually damaging the blood supply to the tumor
and causing tumor necrosis.
Ing3A, but not PMA, binds to and inhibits P-gp function
The inhibitory effect of CsA on Ing3A-mediated anticancer
activity is not likely to result from the involvement of the calcineurin/NFAt pathway because both Ing3A and PMA induced similar levels of interleukin (IL)-2 (Supplementary
Table S1). In addition, other phosphatase inhibitors did not
block Ing3A-induced hemorrhage (data not shown). CsA is
known to target and inhibit the drug transport activities of
P-gp, which is linked to the development of multidrug resistance in cancer cells (28). The expression of mdr1/P-gp has
been reported in keratinocytes of neonatal and adult mouse
skin (29, 30). We also detected the expression of mouse
mdr1/P-gp protein and transcript (Abcb1a) in skin extracts
from adult nude mice and from extracts of human skin organotypic raft cultures (Fig. 6A). To confirm the involvement of
P-gp in Ing3A-induced hemorrhage, other modulators of P-gp,
verapamil (31) and XR9576 (32), were applied to the back
of nude mice before the application of Ing3A. As shown
in Fig. 6B, all three compounds successfully blocked Ing3Ainduced hemorrhage. Because CsA, verapamil, and XR9576
are specific but structurally unrelated modulators for P-gp,
our results suggested that P-gp contributed to Ing3A-induced
hemorrhage in skin. In addition, Ing3A, but not PMA, successfully competed with radiolabeled photoaffinity substrate
IAAP for direct binding to P-gp (Fig. 6D, top). At nontoxic
concentration, Ing3A, but not PMA, also reversed the resistance to doxorubicin in human P-gp–expressing HCT-15 cells
(Fig. 6C). Furthermore, Ing3A was more potent than PMA
in blocking calcein AM efflux in human P-gp–expressing
KB-V1 cells (Fig. 6D, middle). These results show that Ing3A
binds to and inhibits the function of human P-gp. The cellassociated Ing3A was significantly less in P-gp–overexpressing
KB-V1 cells than its parental line KB-31, and this was reversed by P-gp inhibitor XR9576 (Fig. 6D, bottom), showing
that Ing3A is a transport substrate for P-gp. Based on these
findings and the other data presented, we suggest that, as a
substrate for P-gp, topically applied Ing3A is transported
from the epidermis to the subepidermal cutaneous tissue
and causes direct damage on the blood vessels in the dermis
and subcutis; in contrast, topically applied PMA is more restricted to the epidermis of skin and does not directly damage the vasculature in the subepidermal compartments.

Discussion
Inhibition of both tumor blood flow and neoangiogenesis
has been considered a promising approach to cancer therapy. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor, is currently approved as
monotherapy or in conjunction with a traditional chemotherapy regimen for colorectal and lung cancers (33). This
approach has not been considered for common skin cancers,
as the cost is prohibitive and surgical therapies are available.

The sensitivity of endothelial cells and endothelial tubes to
disruption by PKC activation has been documented in the
past (27), and Ing3A may provide a topical approach to penetrate into invading tumor tissue with an agent that targets
intrinsic tumor blood vessels through the PKC pathway.
A previous study of topical Ing3A and placebo on mouse
skin clearly showed the importance of the neutrophilic infiltrate to mediate the necrotic response of the tumor and prevent tumor recurrence (16). PKC-mediated neutrophilic
cutaneous infiltrates are the response to the upregulation
of specific chemokines from activated keratinocytes (34, 35),
and both topical Ing3A and PMA induced similar chemokine/cytokine profiles in treated skin and the inflammatory
response was inhibited by dexamethasone and indomethacin, the same anti-inflammatory agents shown previously
to block PKC-mediated inflammation (26, 36, 37). Inhibitor
studies indicated that blocking the Ing3A-induced inflammation was not by itself sufficient to alter the antitumor response, whereas blocking the associated hemorrhage
reduced antitumor activity. Irritant activity of Ing3A likely
accounts for the weak tumor-promoting response on mouse
skin (13), but experiments show that irritant activity predominates in eradicating tumors (13). By restricting topical exposure to lesional areas in the therapeutic setting, the irritant
activity should not impede efficacy.
The unique finding that CsA inhibited Ing3A-mediated
hemorrhage and reduced the antitumor activity without altering the inflammatory response suggested that disruption
of tumor vasculature and induction of skin hemorrhage are
principal actions for Ing3A to be an effective anticancer drug
on skin. Both Ing3A and PMA exerted the identical disruptive
effect on cultured endothelial tubes that would be consistent
with in vivo vascular leakage, but in vivo, activated endothelial cells were only detected in the dermis and subcutis after
Ing3A treatment of intact skin. Previous studies on ex vivo
endothelial cells confirmed that Ing3A treatment activated
endothelial cells in a PKC-dependent response, upregulating
E-selectin, ICAM1, and IL-8 and leading to neutrophil adhesion and migration (38). In our in vivo study, electron microscopy, light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and in vivo
lectin labeling indicated that only Ing3A disrupted the vasculature below the epidermis and in grafted tumors. However,
PMA could also induce hemorrhage if it was delivered to bypass the epidermis. Together, these data indicate that a
unique property of Ing3A is its ability to penetrate beyond
the epidermis and into the dermis and subcutis where the
vasculature resides. Our results indicate that Ing3A, but not
PMA, binds to and is a transport substrate for P-gp, that P-gp
is expressed in the skin, that multiple disparate modulators
of P-gp prevent Ing3A-induced hemorrhage, and that CsA reduces the antitumor activity of Ing3A. Together, we conclude
that active transport of Ing3A through the ABC transporter,
ABCB1, provides the unique activity of Ing3A, once it has
penetrated into the epidermal layer, to be actively transported
to the subepidermal compartments. The antitumor benefit of
Ing3A thus is provided through an action on deeply embedded tumor cells where it may be directly cytotoxic or growth
inhibitory (Supplementary Fig. S1D; ref. 39), inflammation

provoking, and disruptive of the tumor vasculature through
PKC activation of endothelial cells.
P-gp has traditionally been associated with resistance to
a variety of natural product anticancer drugs due to its
function as the drug efflux pump and decreased drug accumulation in cancer cells. However, P-gp is present in the
membranes of many normal cell types, including epithelial
cells, where it may function to transport environmental toxins and toxic metabolites out of cells to protect the host.
Skin is largely protected from environmental toxins through
the formation of the lipid barrier encompassed in the stratum corneum (40). Drug penetration through this barrier
and the consequent complex metabolic enzymes of the epidermis complicate this site as a therapeutic portal (41).
Mouse and human epidermis and keratinocytes express
the mdr1a and mdr1b/MDR1 (ABCB1) gene, and the functional activity of human cutaneous P-gp has been shown
by studies of rhodamine 123 transport and inhibition by verapamil and other P-gp inhibitors (30, 42). Furthermore, the
expression and activity of P-gp in human skin keratinocytes
is increased by inflammatory mediators that would be
found in a tumor microenvironment (43). The functioning
of cutaneous P-gp in “absorptive” transport, carrying drugs
from the skin surface to the dermis and subcutis, was aptly
shown by the elegant studies of Ito and colleagues (29). Using genetic approaches, these authors showed that P-gp is
essential for the efficient delivery of drugs across the epidermis and into the dermis and hypodermis of mouse skin.
Further, they showed by pharmacologic experiments that
inhibition of P-gp prevented absorptive drug transport.
Our studies now indicate that the biological effectiveness
of Ing3A, an anticancer agent that can pass the stratum
corneum barrier and traffics to and functions in the dermis
and hypodermis, is through P-gp–mediated absorptive drug
transport. Whereas our biological conclusions are drawn

from mouse preclinical models and known P-gp inhibitors,
our studies shown in Fig. 4 indicate that Ing3A penetrates
into the dermis of human skin organotypic reconstructions
and in Fig. 6 indicate that Ing3A is a substrate for human
P-gp. Given this mechanism of action for Ing3A and potentially other topical therapeutics, the documented polymorphisms in the human MDR1 (ABCB1) gene (28, 44)
could be another determinant of therapeutic efficacy for individual patients. The skin is increasingly considered an advantageous site for drug delivery (45). The prospect of
individual variation in absorptive drug transport may need
to be investigated to predict therapeutic potential through
this portal.
