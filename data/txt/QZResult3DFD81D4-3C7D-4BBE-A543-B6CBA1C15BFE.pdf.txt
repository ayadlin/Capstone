Abstract
‘‘Mitocans’’ from the vitamin E group of selective anticancer
drugs, A-tocopheryl succinate (A-TOS) and its ether analogue
A-TEA, triggered apoptosis in proliferating but not arrested
endothelial cells. Angiogenic endothelial cells exposed to the
vitamin E analogues, unlike their arrested counterparts,
readily accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) by interfering with the mitochondrial redox chain and activating
the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The vitamin E analogues
inhibited angiogenesis in vitro as assessed using the ‘‘woundhealing’’ and ‘‘tube-forming’’ models. Endothelial cells deficient in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were resistant to the
vitamin E analogues, both in ROS accumulation and apoptosis
induction, maintaining their angiogenic potential. A-TOS
inhibited angiogenesis in a mouse cancer model, as documented by ultrasound imaging. We conclude that vitamin E
analogues selectively kill angiogenic endothelial cells, suppressing tumor growth, which has intriguing clinical implications. [Cancer Res 2007;67(24):11906–13]

Introduction
Under physiologic conditions, endothelial cells are suspended in
G0 and proliferate only in response to endothelial injury. In growing
tumors, malignant cells secrete a cocktail of mitogens, such as
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth
factor 2 (FGF2), which diffuse from the tumor cell and interact with
cognate receptors on preexisting endothelial cells, triggering their
proliferation (1). A prerequisite for tumor progression beyond a
small initial carcinoma is formation of new blood vessels, a process
known as angiogenesis. The stage at which tumor growth
stimulates the ‘‘switch-to-the-angiogenic-phenotype’’ is not known.
It has been assumed that this occurs at the stage when the
diffusion of oxygen and nutrients across the cells is hampered so
that a hypoxic core within the growing tumor is formed (2, 3).
Because angiogenesis is essential for tumor progression, its

inhibition makes a plausible anticancer strategy (4–6). Several
approaches have been used to inhibit tumor angiogenesis and
prevent tumor progression, including gene therapy, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy (7–9).
A novel approach to inhibit angiogenesis is selective induction of
apoptosis in endothelial cells (10). Hogg and colleagues (11)
recently observed that targeting angiogenic endothelial cells by an
arsenic derivative efficiently suppressed their proliferation and
drove them into apoptosis. This translated to suppression of tumor
progression and regression of tissue vascularization (10, 11). The
authors showed that the drug interfered with the function of the
adenine nucleotide translocator within the mitochondrial inner
membrane. This is consistent with the notion that mitochondria
are emerging as novel targets for cancer therapy (11–13).
We have defined a class of compounds, mitocans, which
suppresses cancer by inducing apoptosis via targeting mitochondria (13). These drugs include a number of cytotoxic agents, such
as the above-mentioned arsenic derivative, as well as a group of
vitamin E analogues, epitomized by the redox-silent a-tocopheryl
succinate (a-TOS), a selective inducer of apoptosis in cancer cells
and a potent anticancer agent (14–20). a-TOS and its analogues
have been shown to efficiently induce apoptosis by targeting
mitochondria, a process involving generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS; refs. 16–19), which also suppresses cancer cell
proliferation (18). Recently, we have shown that a-TOS causes ROS
generation in cancer cells by displacing ubiquinone in its binding
sites on complex II (13). This activity of vitamin E analogues
translates to cancer suppression in a variety of preclinical models
(15, 20–23).
We observed earlier that a-TOS specifically caused apoptosis in
proliferating endothelial cells, being nontoxic to arrested endothelial cells, although the mechanism was not resolved (24). Because
this finding is suggestive of selective toxicity of a-TOS for
angiogenic endothelial cells, we explored this phenomenon in
more detail. Here we present data on the mechanism of greater
susceptibility of angiogenic endothelial cells to a-TOS as well as to
the ether analogue and link this efficacy to inhibition of tumor
angiogenesis in vivo in a preclinical model of breast cancer using
mice with spontaneous breast carcinomas.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatment. The endothelial-like EAhy926 cells (25)
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 100 Amol/L hypoxanthine,
0.4 Amol/L aminopterin, and 16 Amol/L thymidine. These cells retain
properties of endothelial cells, including expression of factor VIII (25),

tube-forming activity, and the propensity to persist in confluent cultures (7).
EAhy926 cells deficient in mtDNA (U0 phenotype) were prepared as detailed
elsewhere (16). Acquisition of the U0 phenotype was confirmed by lack of
expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II but not subunit IV (data not
shown).
The cells were treated under conditions of high, medium, or nil
proliferation (40–50%, f70%, and 100% confluency, respectively). The drugs
used (Supplementary Scheme 1) were a-tocopherol (a-TOH), the ester
analogue a-TOS (both Sigma), and the orally applicable ether analogue
2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2R-(4R,8R,12-trimethyltridecyl)-chroman-6-yloxyacetic
acid (a-tocopheryloxyacetic acid, a-TEA; ref. 22).
Assessment of apoptosis and mitochondrial potential. Apoptosis was
estimated routinely by the Annexin V binding method based on phosphatidyl serine externalization at the relatively early phases of programmed
cell death, essentially as described elsewhere (16).
Mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential (DW m) was estimated
using the polychromatic probe 5,5¶,6,6‘-tetrachloro-1,1’,3,3¶-tetraethylbenzimidoazolyl-carbocyanino iodide (JC-1; Molecular Probes) as detailed
elsewhere (16).
Evaluation of ROS accumulation, cell proliferation, and cell cycle
distribution. Cellular ROS were detected indirectly by flow cytometry using
dihydroethidinium (DHE; Molecular Probes; ref. 18) and directly by electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (16), after treatment of cells
with a-TOS or a-TEA. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated for
1 h with 2 Amol/L mitochondrially targeted coenzyme Q (MitoQ; ref. 26) or
coincubated with superoxide dismutase [polyethylene glycol-superoxide
dismutase (PEG-SOD); Sigma S4636] at 750 units/mL.
Cell proliferation was determined using an ELISA colorimetric kit
(Roche) to determine the number of cells in S phase of the cell cycle, based
on DNA incorporation of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) using the
manufacturer’s protocol. For cell cycle analysis, cells were plated in 24-well
plates so that they reached f50%, 70%, and 100% confluency after
24-h recuperation. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in buffer
containing sodium citrate (1%), Triton X-100 (0.1%), RNase A (0.05 Ag/mL),
and propidium iodide at 5 Ag/mL, incubated in the dark for 30 min at 4jC
and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Assessment of complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) activity.
Solutions of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT; Sigma) were prepared before use by dissolving 2.5 mg/mL of MTT in
PBS containing 20 mmol/L succinic acid (pH 7.4) as the sole substrate.
Stock solutions of thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA; Sigma) in DMSO, and
a-TOS and MitoQ in ethanol were prepared. The drugs were tested on
EAhy926 cells in the exponential growth phase in 96-well microtiter plates
using four to eight replicate wells per drug dilution assayed. To assess the
ability of MitoQ to restore MTT reduction, cells were preincubated for
3 h with 3 Amol/L MitoQ. Cells were allowed to reduce MTT for 2 h at 37jC,
and absorbance was measured at 570 nm.
Wound-healing and tube-forming activity assessment. Endothelial
cells were seeded and cultured to complete confluence. The central region
of a monolayer of cells was ‘‘wounded’’ by scraping away cells, generating
a denuded 0.5-mm wide stripe. Regrowth of cells was assessed by
following the kinetics of filling the gap, visualized under a microscope
equipped with a grid in the eyepiece. The healing rate was expressed in
Am/h.
For the tube-forming activity of endothelial cells, formation of capillarylike structures in a three-dimensional setting was assessed, essentially as
described elsewhere (7). In brief, 300 AL of cold Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
per well were transferred with a cold tip using a 24-well plate. Matrigel was
overlaid with a suspension of EAhy926 cells, so that a total of 200 AL of
complete medium with 5  105 cells were added to each well. After 6 h in
the incubator, the polygonal structures, made by a network of EAhy926
capillaries was established. The cells were treated and tube-forming activity
was estimated by counting the number of complete capillaries connecting
individual points of the polygonal structures in a light microscope 24 h after
transferring the cells to Matrigel. Three fields in the central area were
chosen randomly in every well. The number of capillaries in control cultures
was considered 100%.

Cell transfections. EAhy926 cells were transfected with a plasmid
harboring the Bcl-xL-EGFP gene (27) as described elsewhere (16). The cells
were maintained in the selection medium for at least five passages, after
which they were assessed for expression of the protein by inspection for
green fluorescence using a fluorescence microscope or by Western blotting,
revealing >95% transfected cells (data not shown).
VE-cadherin expression. Western blotting was performed as reported
earlier (16) using anti–VE-cadherin IgG (Santa Cruz). For immunofluorescence microscopy, EAhy926 cells at f40% or 100% confluence were
incubated with anti–VE-cadherin IgG, followed by secondary FITCconjugated IgG and mounting with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole–containing
Vectashield. The cells were inspected in the Leica DMIRE2 fluorescence
microscope fitted with deconvolution software.
In vivo experiments. A colony of transgenic FVB/N202 c-neu mice
carrying the rat HER-2/neu proto-oncogene driven by the mouse mammary
tumor virus promoter on the H-2q FVB/N background (28) was established
at the Griffith University Animal Facility and maintained under strict
inbreeding conditions. Approximately 70% of the female mice develop
spontaneous mammary carcinomas with a mean latency of f7 months.
Formation of tumors was monitored by ultrasound imaging using the
Vevo770 instrument (VisualSonics) equipped with the VisualSonics RMV704
scan head (mean frequency, 60 MHz; resolution, 40 Am), allowing
noninvasive scanning of tumor tissue and tumor volume quantification.
Scanning was performed on mice anesthetized using isoflurane with
continuous monitoring of the heart rate as reported elsewhere (23). As soon
as tumors were detected, the mice were treated by i.p. administration every
3 days of a-TOS dissolved in corn oil/4% ethanol (15 Amol a-TOS per
injection per mouse). The kinetics of tumor growth was followed by
ultrasound imaging every 3rd day.
The Vevo770 ultrasound imaging device is equipped with the Power
Doppler function, which makes it possible to follow circulation in blood
vessels. This was applied to assess the extent of angiogenesis in the FVB/N
c-neu mice carcinomas. The control and treated mice were assessed by
ultrasound imaging using the same respiratory gating, and the volume of
blood vessels within tumors was expressed as percentage of vascularization
of individual tumors.

Results
We first exposed EAhy926 cells at different levels of proliferation
to a-TOS and a-TEA. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, endothelial cells at
the lowest confluency were most susceptible to apoptosis, whereas
arrested endothelial cells showed much greater resistance. Proliferating endothelial cells neither accumulated ROS nor underwent
apoptosis when exposed to the redox-active a-TOH (Supplementary
Table S1). Both a-TOS and a-TEA also suppressed proliferation of
endothelial cells (Fig. 1C and D). The differences in proliferation of
endothelial cells were assessed by cell cycle distribution (Supplementary Fig. S1A) revealing only a small S phase subpopulation in
the arrested cells, whereas a high number of cells in S phase were
found for the 50% proliferating cultures. Supplementary Fig. S1B
documents high levels of expression in the confluent endothelial
cells of the cell surface protein VE-cadherin involved in cell-cell
contact of endothelial cells.
The fact that angiogenic endothelial cells are susceptible to the
mitocans a-TOS and a-TEA raises the question of the role of
mitochondria in apoptosis induced by vitamin E analogues, with
a-TOS known to cause accumulation of ROS in cancer cells. We
therefore assessed endothelial cells under conditions of proliferation and arrest for ROS generation as a response to a-TOS or
a-TEA. Indeed, proliferating but not arrested endothelial cells
responded to the challenge by early accumulation of high levels of
ROS, as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2A and B) and EPR
spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. S2). MitoQ and SOD suppressed

ROS generation and apoptosis induction by the vitamin E
analogues in angiogenic endothelial cells (Fig. 2C and D).
Next, the role of mitochondria in apoptosis of endothelial cells
exposed to a-TOS and a-TEA was investigated. Supplementary
Fig. S3A shows that the majority (>97%) of control cells had high
DW m, whereas exposing proliferating endothelial cells to either
agent resulted in early (within 24 h) dissipation of DW m, occurring
in 15% to 20% of the population. Mitochondrial destabilization is
generally followed by caspase activation. Supplementary Fig. S3B
reveals that caspases were activated in apoptosis induced by the
two vitamin E analogues because the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk efficiently inhibited apoptosis in proliferating endothelial cells.
We also show here that overexpression in endothelial cells of the
antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL protected the cells from a-TOS– and
a-TEA–induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
We have shown that vitamin E analogues cause generation of
ROS with ensuing induction of apoptosis in cancer cells by interfering with coenzyme Q binding in the mitochondrial complex II.
We therefore tested the possibility that a-TOS triggers ROS
generation in endothelial cells by interfering with the complex II
SDH activity. Table 1 documents that a-TOS and a-TEA inhibited
SDH activity similarly, as shown for TTFA, a compound known
to displace coenzyme Q in complex II. Inhibition of SDH activity
by a-TOS, a-TEA, or TTFA was rescued by MitoQ, which is known
to interact with complex II. These data strongly suggest that
a-TOS and a-TEA act by interfering with ubiquinone binding of
complex II.
We next asked the question whether the propensity of
angiogenic endothelial cells to undergo apoptosis, when challenged with vitamin E analogues, translates to inhibition of
angiogenesis. We used two experimental approaches to assess
angiogenesis in vitro, based on the wound-healing and the tubeforming activity assays. In the wound-healing assay, cells were
grown to complete confluence and then a central strip of cells
was removed, after which regrowth into the cleared space was
evaluated (Supplementary Fig. S4). Figure 3A and B show that the
healing rate was f20 Am/h for control cells, f8 and f3 Am/h for
cells exposed to 25 and 37.5 Amol/L a-TOS, respectively. No
regrowth was observed at 50 Amol/L a-TOS. A dose-dependent
inhibition of wound healing was also observed for a-TEA (Fig. 3C
and D). Importantly, inhibition of wound healing by the vitamin E
analogues was associated with extensive apoptosis induction in
the wound zone of the endothelium (Fig. 3B and D). Next, a dosedependent inhibitory effect on endothelial cell tube-forming
activity was observed for a-TOS and a-TEA (Fig. 4). The vitamin E
analogues suppressed the tube-forming activity of the endothelial
cells by way of apoptosis induction, as found by assessing the cells
for apoptosis after their treatment and analysis after retrieval from
the Matrigel cultures.
The role of mitochondria in susceptibility of angiogenic
endothelial cells to a-TOS was confirmed in experiments in which
mtDNA-deficient endothelial cells were exposed to the vitamin E
analogue and assessed for ROS accumulation and apoptosis
induction by flow cytometry. As documented in Fig. 5A, dividing
populations of U0 cells, unlike their parental counterparts, showed
reduced levels of ROS. The subconfluent U0 endothelial cells also
failed to undergo efficient apoptosis when exposed to a-TOS
(Fig. 5B). We were interested whether endothelial cells deficient in
mtDNA maintain their wound-healing and tube-forming activity,
and, if so, how this is affected by a-TOS. Figure 5C and D reveal
that endothelial cells deficient in mtDNA are capable of wound

increasing periods of time and assessed for apoptosis induction by the Annexin V

healing and tube formation, although at a slower rate than the
parental cells. Importantly, the U0 cells maintained the two features
of in vitro angiogenesis (wound healing and tube formation) even
in the presence of a-TOS. These results strongly suggest the
importance of normal mitochondrial function for susceptibility of
angiogenic endothelial cells to vitamin E analogues.
We next tested whether the inhibitory activity of a-TOS on
angiogenesis in vitro translates to an in vivo situation. Hence, we
used the transgenic FVB/N c-neu mice that form spontaneous
breast ductal carcinomas at the age of f7 months due to
mammary tissue–specific overexpression of the receptor tyrosine
kinase erbB2 (HER2). In particular, we studied the effect of i.p.
administered a-TOS on the kinetics of the tumor growth and

Figure 2. Vitamin E analogues cause
accumulation of mitochondria-derived superoxide
in angiogenic endothelial cells. EAhy926 cells
were seeded at two different densities to achieve
f50% and 100% confluent cells, at which stage
they were exposed to a-TOS (A ) or a-TEA (B )
at 25 and 50 Amol/L for increasing periods of
time. Generation of ROS was assessed after
incubating the cells with DHE and estimating
mean fluorescence intensity (MFI ) using flow
cytometry. Proliferating EAHy926 cells were
pretreated for 10 min with PEG-SOD (25 units/mL)
or 2 h with 3 Amol/L MitoQ and assessed
for ROS accumulation using flow cytometry after
3 h (C ) or for apoptosis induction using the

vascularization of the carcinomas. This was performed using the
Power Doppler function of the ultrasound instrument that allows
for noninvasive and very precise quantification of the tumor
volume and percentage tumor vascularization. Figure 6 documents
that a-TOS suppressed growth of the tumor, decreasing the volume
of the carcinomas by f30%. Importantly, the extent of tumor
vascularization increased with time in the control mice, whereas it
decreased significantly when the animals were treated with the
vitamin E analogue. These data link the antitumor efficacy of
a-TOS with its propensity to act as an antiangiogenic agent in vivo.

Discussion
Our earlier data showed that proliferating endothelial cells,
unlike their confluent counterparts, were susceptible to apoptosis
induction when exposed to a-TOS (24), but the molecular
mechanism had not been resolved. Recent data by Don et al. (10)

are consistent with our findings because they showed that
proliferating endothelial cells were susceptible to the mitocan
arsenide, whereas growth arrested cells were resistant to the drug,
although the reasons for protection of the growth-arrested
endothelial cells were not identified.
Our major interest was to understand the molecular mechanism
of differential sensitivity of endothelial cells to the clinically
interesting vitamin E analogues in relation to their proliferative
status. Because in vivo endothelial cells in tumors show a high
proliferative rate, whereas endothelial cells of normal blood vessels
feature a very long half-life before dividing, it can be expected that
vitamin E analogues will kill angiogenic endothelial cells in tumors
but not endothelial cells of the normal vasculature. Similarly, as
shown by Don et al. (10), we also found that proliferating
endothelial cells responded to exposure to apoptogenic vitamin E
analogues by accumulation of relatively high levels of ROS. In the
case of agents such as a-TOS, the mechanism of generation of ROS

in cancer cells is most likely due to displacement by the vitamin E
analogue of ubiquinone in one or both of its binding pockets
within the mitochondrial complex II (13). It is therefore probable
that the absence of the electron acceptor, ubiquinone, will result
in recombination of electrons with molecular oxygen to form
superoxide. It has been shown that the absence of complex II
[more specifically, the cytochrome B-large, CybL, or the SDH
subunit C (SDHC)] due to mutations in SDHC results in lower
levels of ROS generation when the cells are exposed to a-TOS or

several unrelated inducers of apoptosis, and this is reflected by low
levels of apoptosis induction (13, 29). We also assessed the possible
role of complex II in apoptosis induction by vitamin E analogues in
endothelial cells and found that a-TOS and a-TEA inhibited SDH
activity, and that it was restored in the presence of the complex
II–interacting MitoQ (30), similarly, as also observed for TTFA,
an agent that displaces coenzyme Q in complex II (31). Our data
suggest a general mechanism of ROS-mediated induction of apoptosis by vitamin E analogues in both cancer cells and proliferating

Vitamin E Analogues Inhibit Angiogenesis

Figure 5. EAhy926 cells deficient in mtDNA are
resistant to a-TOS. Proliferating parental or
mtDNA-deficient (q0 ) EAhy926 cells were exposed
to a-TOS at 25 Amol/L or as shown and assessed
for ROS accumulation using DHE (A) and for
apoptosis induction using the Annexin V binding
method (B). Parental and mtDNA-deficient
endothelial cells were seeded in Petri dishes, allowed
to reach confluency, and the endothelium wounded.
Regrowth was followed in the absence or presence
of 25 Amol/L a-TOS at 24 h and evaluated as detailed
in Materials and Methods (C). Parental and

endothelial cells, which is based on displacement of coenzyme Q
in its binding pocket(s) in the mitochondrial complex II, which
results in generation of superoxide. We propose that this site is
also likely to be responsible for the antiangiogenic effect of vitamin E analogues by way of binding of vitamin E analogues that
displace the natural electron acceptor, resulting in generation of
apoptosis-inducing ROS levels.
Not only does the selectivity of vitamin E analogues as agents
inducing apoptosis in angiogenic endothelial cells have significant
clinical relevance in helping to arrest tumor progression, but also
the molecular mechanism as defined here is of major interest and
importance. Don et al. (10) reported on selective killing of
proliferating endothelial cells by an arsenic derivative. They
showed that the angiogenic cells accumulated high levels of ROS,
unlike their arrested counterparts. We also observed this in
angiogenic endothelial cells exposed to a-TOS and a-TEA. These
differences in accumulation of ROS seem central to the susceptibility or resistance of the endothelial cells to apoptosis because
eliminating ROS accumulation, such as by coexposure to
antioxidants, also suppresses the extent of apoptosis. Numerous
compounds have been reported to inhibit angiogenesis by way of
killing proliferating endothelial cells or causing their cytostasis.
These include anticancer drugs paclitaxel (32, 33) or vinblastine
(34), the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 (35), the vasculartargeting compound ZD6126 (36), or the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib (37). Although these agents have been shown to reduce
tumors in experimental animals, neither of them has been reported
for selective toxicity toward proliferating while being nontoxic to
arrested endothelial cells. To the best of our knowledge, this
intriguing paradigm has only been shown for the mitocans

selectivity of apoptosis induction in angiogenic endothelial cells
by vitamin E analogues is particularly interesting because vitamin
E analogues have shown promise as anticancer agents in several
animal models. This is further fueled by our clinical outcome from
a mesothelioma patient who has been treated with transdermally
applied a-TOS. The data reveal a significant clinical benefit with
a-TOS therapy, causing a reduction in tumor volume and improved
well-being of our subject who previously was suffering from a lethal
neoplastic pathology (38, 39).
The molecular mechanism for the very low levels of ROS
accumulation in arrested endothelial cells exposed to vitamin E
analogues is not known at present. We can suggest at least two
possibilities that could explain this. First, the arrested cells may
respond to the stress imposed by vitamin E analogues by
generating lower levels of ROS due to a difference in the cellular
systems that cause formation of radicals. The other, probably more
plausible possibility, is due to potential up-regulation of the
antioxidant systems in the resistant, arrested endothelial cells. One
enzyme that may be up-regulated is manganese superoxide
dismutase (MnSOD). This idea is consistent with reports showing
that cells deficient in mtDNA are resistant to apoptosis and show
increased expression of MnSOD (40–42). We have also found
elevated expression of MnSOD in arrested endothelial cells,7
possibly related to higher levels of p53 (43, 44). The molecular
mechanism of regulation of MnSOD expression in endothelial cells
in relation to their proliferative status is the subject of ongoing
studies.

Because killing of angiogenic endothelial cells by a-TOS and
a-TEA suggests that vitamin E analogues may possess antiangiogenic activity, thereby suppressing tumor progression, we studied
the effect of the two agents on angiogenesis in vitro. In these
experiments, we used the immortalized EAhy926 cells because
these cells, unlike the primary endothelial cells with limited life
span (usually four to five cell cycle transitions), can be used for up
to 100 doublings, while preserving properties of primary endothelial cells including expression of von Willebrand factor or P selectin,
as well as formation of tubes in a three-dimensional setting and
persistent arrest (7, 25). Our results clearly document the efficacy of
a-TOS and a-TEA in inhibiting angiogenesis in vitro, as assessed by
both the wound-healing and tube-forming approach. Importantly,
inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro was associated with the
induction of apoptosis in the proliferating endothelial cells, which
suggests a link between the efficacy of vitamin E analogues to
induce apoptosis in proliferating endothelial cells with their
antiangiogenic activity.
We also assessed endothelial cells deficient in mtDNA for their
susceptibility to a-TOS because U0 cancer cells are resistant to
apoptosis (16, 19, 40, 45) and feature an impaired mitochondrial
electron redox chain, a major source of ROS generation (46, 47).
We found that U0 endothelial cells were relatively resistant to
a-TOS–induced apoptosis. We also observed that U0 endothelial
cells retained the propensity of normal endothelial cells to undergo
wound healing after injury as well as tube forming in Matrigel, and
that neither the wound-healing nor the tube-forming activities were

impaired by a-TOS. These are important findings that further
support the importance of fully functional mitochondria to make
angiogenic endothelial cells susceptible to apoptosis induction by
vitamin E analogues.
Lastly, we evaluated the effect of a-TOS on angiogenesis in vivo.
To do this, we used the transgenic FVB/N c-neu mice with
spontaneous development of breast carcinomas (28). We have
observed recently that analogues of vitamin E coupled to peptides
binding the HER2 receptor suppressed progression of these tumors
(23). The Vevo770 ultrasound device allows us to visualize and
quantify blood vessels so that noninvasive assessment of the
kinetics of angiogenesis in tumors treated with a potential inhibitor
of angiogenesis can be assessed directly in real time in vivo. We
found that a-TOS significantly suppressed tumor progression,
consistent with our recent report (23), and that this was
accompanied by inhibition of angiogenesis. Ultrasound imaging
revealed that the percentage of the tumor mass occupied by blood
vessels increased in control animals by as much as f8-fold over the
3 weeks of the experiment in the control animals, whereas it was
suppressed by f50% in mice treated with a-TOS. These data
unequivocally document the antiangiogenic property of a-TOS. This
result is of clinical relevance because HER2-positive breast cancer is
resistant to therapy (48) and because breast cancer accounts for
>25% of female cancer patients in the USA, with almost 200,000 new
cases and >40,000 deaths predicted for 2007 (49).
Our in vitro results suggest that apoptosis is a plausible factor
by which vitamin E analogues inhibit angiogenesis. However, we

Vitamin E Analogues Inhibit Angiogenesis

cannot rule out other possibilities that may contribute to the
overall antiangiogenic activity of the drugs. These include, in
particular, the effect of a-TOS on expression of genes by which
tumor cells promote angiogenesis, such as VEGF, as shown for
breast cancer cells (50), and FGF2, as reported for mesothelioma
cells (18, 51). Notwithstanding, apoptosis seems to be an
important mechanism by which vitamin E analogues inhibit
angiogenesis, thereby inhibiting tumor progression, which is
clinically intriguing.
