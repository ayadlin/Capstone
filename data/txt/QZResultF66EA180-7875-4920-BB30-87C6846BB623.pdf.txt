Abstract

Author Manuscript

Emerging evidence has linked photoreceptor cell-specific nuclear receptor (PNR/NR2E3), an
orphan nuclear hormone receptor, to human breast cancer. PNR was shown to be a transcriptional
activator of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) in ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines and high-level
expression of PNR correlates with favorable response of ERα-positive breast cancer patients to
tamoxifen. Interestingly, gene expression microarray study shows that PNR regulates distinct
genes from those regulated by ERα, suggesting that PNR could have ERα-independent functions.
Herein, we investigated the function of PNR in ERα-negative breast cancer cells. Our results
showed that PNR-induced cell migration and metastasis of ERα-negative breast cancer cells both
in vitro and in vivo, and the effect was attributed to the upregulation of interleukin (IL)-13Rα2, a
high-affinity receptor for IL-13 that regulates tumor growth, invasion and metastasis of various
human cancers. Mechanistically, PNR activated transcription of IL-13Rα2 through direct
recruitment to IL-13Rα2 promoter. Upon stimulation with IL-13, IL-13Rα2 increased the
extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 phosphorylation, which led to breast cancer
migration and metastasis. The IL-13 triggered signal cascade was specific to IL-13Rα2, as the
closely related IL-13Rα1 was not regulated by PNR. IL-13Rα2 is a novel tumor antigen that is
overexpressed in a variety of solid tumor types. This study presents the first evidence that PNR
could promote ERα-negative breast cancer metastasis through activation of IL-13Rα2-mediated
signaling pathway.

Photoreceptor cell-specific nuclear receptor (PNR), an orphan nuclear receptor, is highly
expressed in retinal cells and has crucial roles in photoreceptor development, differentiation
and survival.1–3 Emerging evidence implicate roles of PNR in breast cancer.4,5 Breast
cancers are biochemically classified into three subtypes: estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-positive,
Her2-positive and triple-negative breast cancers that lack the expression of ERα,

to the promoter region of ERα and increases ERα expression.4 By knocking down PNR or
ERα individually in MCF7 cells, gene networks shared between PNR and ERα were
identified using DNA microarray analysis.4 Although 525 target genes were shared between
PNR and ERα in MCF7 cells, 1847 target genes were solely regulated by PNR independent
of ERα, indicating that PNR may have functions regardless of ERα expression (for example,
in ERα-negative breast cancer).4 In another study, the expression of all human nuclear
receptors was examined in 116 human breast samples containing both normal and neoplastic
breast tumors. PNR was found expressed in ERα-negative breast cancer.5 Thus far, the role
of PNR in ERα-negative breast cancer has not been investigated.

Interleukin-13 (IL-13), a TH2 cytokine, has crucial roles not only in cancers but also in the
autoimmune diseases.6,7 IL-13 interacts with two membrane receptors, a heterodimeric
receptor composed of IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1 and monomeric IL-13Rα2 receptor. IL-13Rα1
reacts with both IL-4 and IL-13 and signals through activation of insulin receptor substratephosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6
pathways in macrophages.8 IL-13Rα2, on the other hand, only reacts with IL-13 at high
affinity. IL-13 has been shown to enhance extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2
(ERK1/2), activator protein 1 (AP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities though
IL-13Rα2 in ovarian cancer cells and regulate invasion and metastasis.9–11 IL-13Rα2 has
also been shown to mediate invasion and metastasis in pancreatic10 and colorectal9 cancers.
Depending on cell types, the activation of IL-13Rα2 by IL-13 induced various downstream
signaling pathways including ERK/AP-1, transforming growth factor-β1,
phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase, AKT and Src activation.7,9–11 AP-1 complex and signal
transducer and activator of transcription 6 were reported as upstream transcriptional factors
for IL-13Rα2 in glioma and keratinocytes, respectively.12,13 IL-13Rα2 is highly expressed
in various solid tumors and regarded as a novel tumor antigen.14 Minn et al.15 reported a
positive correlation between IL-13Rα2 expression and breast cancer metastasis to lung.
However, the function and regulation of IL-13Rα2 in breast cancer have not been fully
elucidated.

In this study, we attempted to elucidate the role of PNR in ERα-negative breast cancer and
unexpectedly discovered a novel functional crosstalk between PNR and IL-13/IL-13Rα2 in
regulating tumor migration and metastasis. Although PNR did not affect cell proliferation in
vitro, it enhanced migration and metastasis of ERα-negative cells in vitro and in vivo. PNR
transcriptionally activated IL-13Rα2 by binding to the proximal promoter region of
IL-13Rα2, which led to upregulation of IL-13Rα2 and activation of ERK1/2. Both PNR
overexpression and IL-13 treatment increased cell migration, which could be abrogated by
IL-13Rα2 knockdown. Moreover, IL-13 expression level inversely correlated with the
overall survival of human breast cancer patients. Collectively, we have demonstrated that
IL-13/IL-13Rα2 signaling has a pivotal role in breast cancer migration and metastasis, and
this pathway is significantly enhanced by PNR in ERα-negative cells. Our results suggest
that targeting IL-13 signaling in combination with inhibiting the activity of PNR may
impose synergistic beneficial effects on triple-negative breast cancer patients.

RESULTS
PNR enhances the migration and colony formation ability of LM2 cells
To investigate the function of PNR in ERα-negative breast cancer cells, we stably expressed
either full-length PNR or FLAG-tagged full-length PNR (FLAG-PNR) in ERα-negative
MDA-MB-231 and LM2 cell lines (Figure 1a). LM2 cell line was derived from MDAMB-231 by in vivo bioluminescence selection with high tendency for lung metastasis.15 As
controls, we also generated ERα-positive MCF7 and T47D cell lines stably expressing PNR
(Supplementary Figure S1A). FLAG-PNR exhibited nuclear localization by immunofluorescence using an α-FLAG antibody, in conforming to its role as a transcriptional factor
(Figure 1b).4,16–19 Further, we found that PNR overexpression did not alter the cell
morphology of MDA-MB-231 and LM2 cell lines (Figure 1c), nor did it significantly affect
cell proliferation in vitro (Figure 1d).

In order to examine the effect of PNR on cell migration, wound-healing assay was
performed and quantified. Although PNR overexpression had no effect on migration of
MCF7, T47D (Supplementary Figure S1B) and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2a), it induced
rapid wound closure in LM2 cells (Figure 2a). To quantitatively measure the increase of
migration, Boyden chamber transwell assay was used where PNR overexpression was
shown to increase migration of LM2 cells by ~1.6-fold (Figure 2b). Conversely, knocking
down PNR by small interfering RNA reduced the endogenous PNR expression by 60% and
decreased migration of LM2 cells (Figure 2c). Overexpression of PNR also increased the
colony formation ability of LM2 cells under low-density seeding (Figure 2d), whereas it did
not seem to alter cell adhesion as no obvious difference could be detected between green
fluorescent protein (GFP) control cells and PNR-overexpressing cells with regards to their
binding to fibronectin, laminin or collagen in the adhesion assay (Figure 2e). Collectively,
PNR increased the migration and colony formation ability of LM2 cells, two parameters
often measured in vitro that are indicative of metastatic potential in vivo.20–22
PNR promotes metastasis in the xenograft mouse models

As PNR enhanced migration of LM2 cells, we further investigated the role of PNR in
tumorigenesis using the mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model. LM2 cells were
retrovirally infected with GFP or PNR and injected into the inguinal mammary fat pads of
nude mice. The tumor growth was measured with digital caliper over the course of
experiment for 40 days. The mice injected with PNR-overexpressing LM2 cells developed
tumors at a greater rate than the non-PNR-expressing control (Figures 3a and b). To verify
that PNR remained to be expressed in tumors at the end of the study, the
immunohistochemistry staining of PNR was performed. The strong nuclear staining of PNR
remained to be detected after 40 days of in vivo tumor growth (Figure 3c). Pre-incubation of
blocking peptides with anti-PNR antibody markedly diminished the nuclear staining,
demonstrating that PNR antibody is target specific (Figure 3c). When the mice were
dissected for histologically analysis, lung metastasis was detected in the PNRoverexpressing group (20%) but not in the GFP control group (0%). Hematoxylin and eosin
staining showed that, in contrast to the GFP control group with no infiltrated tumor cells,
lung of PNR group was heavily infiltrated with tumor cells (Figure 3d). To exclude the

possibility of inflammation, we performed immunohistochemistry using antibodies against
human Ki67 and firefly luciferase because LM2 cells stably express firefly luciferase when
they were selected in vivo.15 The nuclear staining of human Ki67 confirmed the human
origin of the cells and the cytoplasmic staining of firefly luciferase verified the identity of
LM2 cells15 (Figure 3d).
IL-13Rα2 mediates PNR-induced migration of LM2 cells

Author Manuscript

The primary tumor outgrowths of breast cancer and lung metastasis are a multiple generegulated event.23,24 The LM2 cell line was originally isolated from a lung metastasis of the
parental MDA-MB-231 cell line and is known for its high tendency to metastasize to lung.15
This prompted us to investigate whether PNR regulates genes involved in lung metastasis
that may account for PNR-mediated migration and metastasis of LM2 cells. We first
examined whether the expression of lung metastasis-related genes15 was altered by
overexpressing PNR. Among the 10 reported metastasis genes being examined, IL-13Rα2
mRNA level was strongly increased by PNR overexpression in MDA-MB-231 and LM2
cells (Figure 4). The upregulation of the expression of IL-13Rα2 mRNA by PNR was also
observed in two additional triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-468 and
BT549 (data not shown). Although several other genes such as MMP1 and EFEMP-1 were
also upregulated by PNR overexpression in LM2 cells (Figure 4b), the fold of activation was
not as significant as IL-13Rα2 and the upregulation was only found in LM2 but not in the
parental MDA-MB-231 cells.

As PNR overexpression increases IL-13Rα2 mRNA level in cell lines, we next investigated
whether the expression of PNR and IL-13Rα2 positively correlates with each other in
human breast tumors. First, a positive correlation between PNR and IL-13Rα2 mRNA levels
(r = 0.24, P<0.0001; Figure 5a) was observed using the bc-GenExMiner database with a
collection of 3161 breast cancer patients.25 The correlation coefficient is comparable to that
of PNR and ERα (n = 2872, r = 0.26, P<0.0001) (Supplementary Figure S2A), which has
been shown to have positive correlation.4 IL-13 signals through two membrane-bound
receptors, IL-13Rα1 and IL-13Rα2.8,26,27 IL-13Rα1, only upon heterodimerization with
IL-4Rα, binds to IL-13 with relatively high affinity,28–30 whereas IL-13Rα2 binds to IL-13
with ~ 50-fold higher affinity than IL-13Rα1.31,32 No correlation at the mRNA levels could
be found between PNR and IL-13Rα1 or with IL-4R (Supplementary Figure S2B).
Consistently, IL-13Rα1 mRNA was found not regulated by PNR (Supplementary Figure
S2C). Interestingly, positive correlation could be observed between PNR and IL-13 at the
mRNA level (Supplementary Figure S2B). When the endogenous PNR was knocked down
by small interfering RNA (Figure 2c), IL-13Rα2 mRNA level was decreased by ~ 60%,
whereas IL-13Rα1 mRNA was not affected (Figure 5b). Notably, MMP1 mRNA level was
also decreased by knocking down PNR (Figure 5b). This was most likely due to a secondary
effect resulted from the decrease of IL-13Rα2 mRNA because IL-13Rα2 was shown to
affect MMP family gene expression11 and knockdown of IL-13Rα2 also caused the
reduction of MMP1 mRNA levels (data not shown). Next, the role of IL-13Rα2 in
regulating migration of breast cancer cells was analyzed. IL-13Rα2 was knocked down by
two short hairpin RNAs expressing lentivirus specific for IL-13Rα2, A11 and E4, in LM2
cells. These short hairpin RNAs could effectively knockdown IL-13Rα2 as detected at both

mRNA and protein levels (Figure 5c), while not affecting IL-13Rα1 mRNA level
(Supplementary Figure S2D). Although silencing of IL-13Rα2 in LM2 cells has no effect on
cell proliferation (Figure 5d), it decreased migration as shown in the transwell assay (Figure
5e), which is opposite to the effect of PNR overexpression. Finally, to demonstrate whether
PNR-induced cell migration is mediated through IL-13Rα2, we overexpressed PNR in LM2
cells, while simultaneously silencing IL-13Rα2. Knockdown of IL-13Rα2 abrogated the
PNR-enhanced cell migration (Figure 5f). Together, these results suggest that PNR promotes
the migration of LM2 cells via activation of IL-13Rα2 signaling.
IL-13 enhances ERK1/2 phosphorylation and regulates migration of LM2 cells in IL-13Rα2dependent manner

IL-13 is a high-affinity ligand for IL-13Rα2 and IL-13 signaling has been implicated in
tumor malignancy of pancreatic, ovarian and colorectal cancers.6,9–11 To examine whether
IL-13 regulates breast cancer cell migration and metastasis, we treated the control and PNRoverexpressing LM2 cells with IL-13 and performed transwell migration assay. Figure 6a
showed that IL-13 treatment alone enhanced the migration ability of LM2 cells, to a level
equivalent to PNR overexpression. Treatment of IL-13 on PNR overexpressed cells only had
slight additive effects, probably due to the saturation of migrated cells in this system (Figure
6a). Next, we measured ERK1/2 phosphorylation to indicate the downstream activation of
IL-13Rα2. The results showed that IL-13 could stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Supplementary Figure S3A) and this effect was mediated by IL-13Rα2 because the
increase of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was abrogated by IL-13Rα2 knockdown (Figure 6b).
U0126, the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor similarly abolished the migration of both control and
PNR-overexpressing LM2 cells (Figure 6c). Correspondingly, knockdown of IL-13Rα2
decreased (Figure 6b), whereas overexpression of PNR increased phosphorylation of
ERK1/2 level (Figure 6). These results collectively suggest that both IL-13 and PNR
induced the migration of LM2 in an IL-13Rα2-dependent manner and that ERK activation
was downstream of PNR and IL-13Rα2-mediated migration of breast cancer cells.
PNR directly regulates IL-13Rα2 gene expression

Author Manuscript

As a nuclear receptor, PNR regulates gene expression by directly binding to the promoter
region of target genes including cyclin D1 and TBX2 in Y79 retinoblastoma cell line19 and
ERα in MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines, respectively.4 As IL-13Rα2 mRNA is
increased by PNR overexpression, we hypothesized that PNR may regulate IL-13Rα2
mRNA stability or regulate IL-13Rα2 gene expression by direct association with the
IL-13Rα2 promoter. Our result that PNR overexpression did not affect IL-13Rα2 transcript
stability after actinomycin D treatment excluded the first probability (Supplementary Figure
S3B). We went on to predict the potential binding sites of PNR on IL-13Rα2 promoter using
the MatInspector software (MatInspector, Genomatix, München, Germany).33 The PNRbinding sites were predicted not at the distal promoter but at the proximal promoter (data not
shown). IL-13 had been reported to increase IL-13Rα2 gene expression by regulating the
distal promoter.13 However, the regulation of distal promoter does not seem to be the main
mechanism in breast cancer cells because IL-13 treatment alone failed to increase IL-13Rα2
mRNA level in both MDA-MB-231 and LM2 cells (Supplementary Figure S3C). This
notion was further supported by the IL-13Rα2 distal promoter-driven luciferase reporter

assay where PNR was unable to increase the luciferase activity (data not shown). To
examine whether PNR influenced the proximal promoter of IL-13Rα2, we performed the
luciferase reporter assay by generating the reporters driven by the terminally deleted
IL-13Rα2 promoter constructs in HEK293T cells (Figure 7a). Two regions of IL-13Rα2
promoter were highly regulated in transcriptional activation assay (Figure 7a). The first
region from −209 to the transcriptional start site contains an AP-1-binding site. A previous
study had shown that AP-1 is a transcriptional factor of IL-13Rα2.12 The second region
from −1200 to −545 contains a putative PNR-binding site shown in Figure 7d as predicted
by the MatInspector software and this also agrees with the formerly identified PNR
consensus sequence.1,34 PNR expression could further enhance the transcriptional activation
of the full-length promoter reporter construct (−1690 to +229) but not the truncated one
(−209 to +229) (Figure 7b). Mutations of PNR in the conserved DNA binding domain were
previously observed in enhanced S-cone syndrome35,36 and affect its homodimerization,
interaction with cofactors and DNA binding.37 Thus, we tested whether PNR mutations
would affect the activation of IL-13Rα2 promoter. The two mutations, R76W and G88W in
the DNA binding domain abolished the activation (Figure 7c), suggesting that the physical
interaction of PNR with IL-13Rα2 promoter is required for IL-13Rα2 activation. In keeping
with this finding, mutation of the consensus PNR-binding site on IL-13Rα2 promoter also
abolished the activation (Figure 7d).

Further, we designed specific primers encompassing these two regions for chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. The ChIP results showed that PNR was indeed
associated with IL-13Rα2 promoter (−834 to −323 bp), which was consistent with the result
of luciferase reporter assay, whereas no PNR could be detected at the AP-1-binding site
(−249 to +229 bp) (Figure 8a). c-Jun is a member of the AP-1 family.38 Using α-c-Jun
antibody for ChIP, we confirmed c-Jun binding at the AP-1 site but not at the PNR-binding
site (Figure 8a). The co-immunoprecipitation experiment revealed no direct interaction
between PNR and c-Jun (data not shown). To further validate that IL-13Rα2 is
transcriptionally activated by PNR, we examined RNA Pol II binding, the acetyl-histone H3
level and H3K4me3 level, which are indicators of transcriptionally active genes39 at
IL-13Rα2 promoter region. The results showed that acetyl-histone H3 levels are elevated
throughout the entire region (P1–P3) and Pol II binding and H3K4me3 level were elevated
by overexpressing PNR at PNR-binding site, which coincide with the activation of
IL-13Rα2 gene (Figures 8b and d). Taken together, our results indicate that PNR regulates
transcription of IL-13Rα2 by direct association with the promoter. Figure 9 summarizes our
findings that PNR directly regulates IL-13Rα2 gene expression to enhance the IL-13Rα2mediated downstream ERK activation. The IL-13/IL--13Rα2-mediated signal transduction
has critical roles in migration and metastasis of ERα-negative cells. The IL-13 stimulation
also has an important role in breast cancer cell migration and metastasis based on our in
vitro functional assays, which is supported by the positive correlation between high IL-13
mRNA level with the poor overall survival of breast cancer (Supplementary Figure S4).

DISCUSSION
Emerging evidence suggest that PNR has a role in breast cancer, in particular in ERαpositive breast cancer. In ERα-positive cells, PNR activates ERα target gene expression and

increases the proliferation rate of MCF7 and T47D cells. We found that in ERα-negative
cells, PNR activates IL-13Rα2 gene expression (Figures 4 and 5) that leads to the increase
of migration and metastasis of LM2 cells (Figures 2 and 3). Interestingly, PNR does not
regulate the expression of IL-13Rα1, nor a positive correlation could be detected between
the expression of PNR and IL-13Rα1 in primary human breast cancer (Supplementary
Figure S2). These pieces of evidence suggest that PNR regulation of IL-13 signaling is
specified through the membrane-bound IL-13Rα2 that activates downstream ERK1/2
signaling cascades to promote metastasis. Thus inhibiting PNR activity would represent a
significant means to inhibit metastasis in breast cancer cells.

Existing literatures reported controversial roles of IL-13Rα2 in breast cancer. One study
showed that overexpression of IL-13Rα2 inhibits growth of human breast and pancreatic
tumors in the immunodefficient mice but has no effect on cell growth in vitro.40 The antitumorigenic activity of IL-13Rα2 may not recapitulate the bona fide function of IL-13Rα2
because of overexpression and variability derived from single clones. In another study, Dr
Massagué’s group demonstrated that IL-13Rα2 did not affect the primary tumor outgrowth
but served as a biomarker and potent mediator of breast cancer lung metastasis.15,23,24,41 In
concordance with previous study that IL-13Rα2 behaves as a signaling receptor rather than a
decoy receptor to intercept IL-13,7 our study underscores the significance of IL-13/
IL-13Rα2-mediated signaling in potentiating breast cancer cell migration (Figure 6) and the
PNR-induced gene activation (Figures 4 and 7). It is believed that the expression level of
IL-13Rα2 affects the receptor distribution and IL-13 signaling.42 Interestingly, despite LM2
was derived from MDA-MB-231 cells, PNR only increased migration of LM2 cells but not
of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 2). The difference could be attributed to activation of
additional metastasis-related genes other than IL-13Rα2 in LM2 cells but not in MDAMB-231 cells (Figure 4). This result also implicated that IL-13Rα2 expression level alone
was insufficient to determine the invasiveness potential of MDA-MB-231 cells. Notably, we
found that IL-13Rα2 and IL-13Rα1 were reversely expressed in LM2 and MDA-MB-231
cells (Supplementary Figure S5). Although IL-13Rα2 was much highly expressed in LM2
cells as compared with MDA-MB-231 cell, IL-13Rα1 showed the opposite trend. Hence, the
two IL-13 receptors may form a negative regulatory loop and the ratio of IL-13Rα2 to
IL-13Rα1 may be indicative of metastasis potential of cancer cells. A previous study15
showed that the lung metastasis frequency of a subclone (4175) of LM2 cells in the nude
mice was 7/13 when injecting into the mammary fat pad and surgically removed the tumors
when the size reached 300 mm3. Our results showed a much lower incidence of lung
metastasis. The discrepancy may be due to the difference in experimental procedures and
cell population. In our experiment, the tumors were allowed to grow but not surgically
removed. Moreover, the LM2 cell line we used was a pool of different clones. Although
some studies used tail vein injection as a model to monitor lung metastasis, we chose to use
orthotropic xenograft model because this model better recapitulates the multi-step
metastasis. Importantly, we could observe significant difference with regards to the tendency
for lung metastasis of LM2 cells overexpressing PNR vs the control group.
PNR does not affect cell proliferation in vitro (Figure 1d), while promoting tumor growth in
vivo (Figure 3). A key difference between these two systems is the tumor microenvironment

that may display features of Th2 inflammation,43 which promotes tumor development.
Studies have shown that thymic stromal lymphopoietin, an inflammatory cytokine either
expressed by breast cancer cells or cancer-associated fibroblasts of prostate cancer, lead to
the production of IL-13 by Th2 cells to promote tumor growth.43–45 Although multiple lines
of evidence have implicated the role of IL-13 signaling in breast cancer development, the
mechanism by which IL-13 promotes breast tumor growth remains elusive. Here we showed
that IL-13 stimulates tumor growth and migration via IL-13Rα2 and the effect was
potentiated by PNR. Interestingly, overexpression of PNR strongly enhances thymic stromal
lymphopoietin expression upon stimulation by PMA and ionomycin (Supplementary Figure
S6), suggesting that PNR may be the central regulator of IL-13-IL-13Rα2 signaling in vivo
via regulating both IL-13 secretion and IL-13Rα2 expression. This model could explain that
IL-13 regulates breast tumor growth by activating IL-13Rα2 and this effect could be
amplified by PNR. The regulation of thymic stromal lymphopoietin by PNR adds another
layer of complexity, indicating that the communication between cancer cells and immune
cells in the tumor microenvironment may have important roles in tumor metastasis in vivo.

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 and AP-1 complex were known to regulate
IL-13Rα2 transcription by binding to the distal and proximal promoters on IL-13Rα212,13 in
keratinocytes and glioma cells, respectively. However, how IL-13Rα2 is transcriptionally
regulated in breast cancer remains unknown. Our study suggests that PNR and c-Jun may
have independent or synergistic effects on IL-13Rα2 regulation. PNR could either activate
or repress gene expression.46 In this study, PNR acts as a transcriptional activator probably
by binding to the unidentified physiological agonists, leading to the recruitment of cofactors
such as NRL, CRX, Reverbα and PIAS3.3,4,16,18,47 The recently resolved crystal structure
of PNR supports that PNR could accommodate 13-cis retinoic acid as an agonist.48 The
molecular mechanism by which PNR regulates IL-13Rα2 gene expression warrants further
investigations.

It is well known that nuclear receptor and epithelial cell growth factor could have functional
crosstalk that has clinical implication in breast cancer.49 We have demonstrated that PNR,
an orphan nuclear receptor, transcriptionally activates IL-13Rα2, and further transduces
downstream signals via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (Figure 6), leading to
breast cancer migration and metastasis. The cell-based observation needs to be validated in
human tumor and serum samples. Secreted IL-13 protein levels in serum should also be
measured to provide basis for evaluation whether IL-13 signaling contributes to the crosstalk
between tumor cells and microenvironment. Although the physiological ligands of PNR
have not been identified, numerous efforts have been made to identify small molecule
agonist of PNR for treatment of retinal-related disease.50–53 As PNR activates ERα in ERαpositive breast cancer cells4 and regulates IL-13Rα2 in ERα-negative cells to promote
tumor metastasis, we believe that small molecule inhibitors of PNR may exert clinical
benefit to breast cancer patients. The crystal structure of PNR ligand-binding domain has
recently been resolved,48 which provides structural basis for in silico screening of small
molecules that either activate PNR for the treatment of retinal-related diseases or inhibit
PNR for the treatment of breast cancer. Given that IL-13Rα2 is overexpressed in various
solid tumor tissues and recently shown to be a novel tumor antigen that could be targeted for

immunotherapy,14 a recombinant fusion IL-13 cytotoxin termed IL-13-PE38QQR has been
developed and elicited potent anti-tumor activity in various human tumor graft murine
models and several phase I/II clinical trials14,54,55 to treat patients with malignant brain
tumors.14 This cytotoxin, however, has not yet applied to human breast cancer. On the basis
of our finding that PNR regulates tumor metastasis via activation of IL-13Rα2 pathway,
modulating the activity of PNR in conjunction with inhibiting the IL-13Rα2-mediated
signaling pathway may elicit synergistic therapeutic effects on breast cancer, in particular on
ERα-negative breast cancers whose current treatment is limited to chemotherapy.

LM2 cell line15 is a kind gift from Dr Joan Massagué. All of the other cell lines were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). HEK293T,
MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and LM2 breast cancer cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal

PNR activates transcription of IL-13Rα2 in the luciferase reporter assays. (a) The truncated
constructs of IL-13Rα2 promoter were transfected into HEK293T cells for luciferase
reporter assay. (b) Vector control (VT) or HA-PNR was co-transfected with IL-13Rα2
promoters (−1690 to +299 or −209 to +229) for luciferase reporter assay. (c) Wild-type PNR
but not DNA-binding mutants activates IL-13Rα2 promoter in reporter assay. (d) Mutation
of the consensus PNR-binding site in IL-13Rα2 promoter results in abrogation of IL-13Rα2
in the reporter assay. **P<0.01; ***P<0.001.

PNR activates the transcription of IL-13Rα2 via direct association with IL-13Rα2 promoter.
(a) PNR and c-Jun were detected at discrete sites on the IL-13Rα2 promoter by ChIP assay
in MDA-MB-231 cells overexpressing FLAG-PNR. ChIP assays were performed with antiFLAG or anti-c-Jun antibodies with anti-IgG as a negative control. PCR amplified products
were shown on agarose gel (bottom). Increased acetylation of histone H3 (b) in the entire
transcription factor-binding region (P1–P3), Pol II binding (c) and H3K4me3 (d) to P3 were
detected on the IL-13Rα2 promoter by ChIP assay using indicated antibodies. P1, P2 and P3
correspond to (−249 to +229), (−545 to −119) and (−834 to −232) on IL-13Rα2 promoter,
respectively.

The proposed mechanism of PNR-induced, IL-13Rα2-mediated breast cancer cell migration
and metastasis. PNR directly binds to the promoter region of IL-13Rα2 to activate its
transcription. The increase of IL-13Rα2 protein level in conjunction with IL-13 treatment
activate downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ERK pathway, which leads
to breast cancer cell migration and metastasis.
