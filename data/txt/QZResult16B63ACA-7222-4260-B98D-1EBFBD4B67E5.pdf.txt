ABSTRACT
PIM protein family, short-lived serine/threonine kinases (PIM1, PIM2 and
PIM3), are weak oncogenes but contribute to tumorigenesis as cancer targets.
Thus, design of a novel pan-PIM inhibitor is still a challenge for current cancer drug
discovery. Herein, we used a Naïve Bayesian model to construct the PIM network
and identified Bad and Hsp90 to interact with PIMs. Then, we screened a series of
candidate small-molecule compounds targeting PIMs, and subsequently synthesized
a novel small-molecule compound PI003 with remarkable anti-proliferative activities
in cervical cancer cells. Moreover, we found that PI003 induced apoptosis via the
death-receptor and mitochondrial pathways by targeting PIMs and affecting Bad and
Hsp90. Combined with microRNA microarray analyses, we demonstrated that some
microRNAs such as miR-1296 and miR-1299 could affect PIM1-STAT3 pathway in
PI003-induced apoptosis. Finally, we reported that PI003 had remarkable anti-tumor
activity and apoptosis-inducing effect in in vivo mouse model. In conclusion, these
results demonstrate that PI003, as a novel synthesized pan-PIM inhibitor, induces
the death-receptor and mitochondrial apoptosis involved in microRNA regulation,
and also possessed remarkable anti-tumor activity and apoptosis-inducing effect
in vivo. Thus, these findings would shed light on discovering more potential new
small-molecule pan-PIM inhibitors in future cervical cancer therapy.

regulated at the level of transcription, translation, and even
proteasomal degradation [4].
PIM family members are weak oncogenes but can
contribute to tumorigenesis by selectively enhancing
tumorigenic capabilities [5]. This effect appears to depend
on the tissue and the nature of the pathways activated by
the molecularly cooperating oncogenes [6]. PIM kinases
represent interesting drug targets because they are often
overexpressed in many cancers and are involved in
cancer-specific pathways, such as cell survival, cell cycle
progression and cell migration. For instance, blocking
PIM1 function via the introduction of a dominant-negative
PIM1 sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to apoptosis
induced by glucose deprivation. Moreover, dominantnegative PIM1 reduces tumorigenicity in pancreatic

INTRODUCTION
PIM proteins are a family of short-lived serine/
threonine kinases that are highly evolutionarily conserved
in multicellular organisms [1]. PIM kinase family is
composed of three members, PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3,
which are highly homologous at the amino acid level
(PIM1 and PIM3 are 71% identical, whereas PIM1 and
PIM2 share 61% homology), but differ partially in their
tissue distributions [2]. Unlike other kinase activities,
the activity of PIM kinases is not primarily regulated
by phosphorylation; instead, PIM kinases are mainly
regulated by transcription. And, PIM kinases do not
have a regulatory domain and are constitutively active
when expressed [3]. Thus, PIM kinases can appear to be

The emerging importance of PIM kinases in human
tumorigenesis has increased interest in developing small
molecule inhibitors targeting these proteins. Different
classes of PIM inhibitors have recently been reported
[9–11], but only a few of them have been tested in cellbased assays or animal models to demonstrate their anticancer activities. In addition, only a few of these inhibitors
are effective against all PIM family kinases because most
of them have been focused on PIM1 [12, 13]. Due to
functional redundancy, simultaneous targeting of all PIM
kinases can be advantageous in treating cancer patients.
Thus, it will led to the design and synthesis of more new
pan-PIM inhibitors for current and future cancer therapy.
In this study, we reported herein that PI003, as a
novel synthesized pan-PIM inhibitor, could induce the
death-receptor and mitochondrial apoptosis involved
in some microRNA regulation, and also possessed
remarkable anti-tumor activity and apoptosis-inducing
effect in vivo.

are selected out. From them we chose 20 drugs for
further experimentally screening, which were P1-P20
(Supplementary Table S1). P1-P20 are varies from each
other in the structure, that means the structural diversity
is considered. The MTT assay for P1-P20 showed that
P1, P4, P9 and P20 had remarkable inhibitory effects
of HeLa cells. Then, we selected out the best one, P9
(Chlorpromazine) (Drugbank number: DB00477) for its
best inhibitory effect and capability for further chemical
modifications. (Figure 1D).
The synthesis of compound PI003 was shown
(Figure 2). 5-(benzyloxy)-2-iodophenol was treated
with
4-(benzyloxy)-1-fluoro-2-nitrobenzene
and
then the reaction was triggered by K2CO3 to obtain
the intermediate 4-(benzyloxy)-1-(5-(benzyloxy)-2iodophenoxy)-2-nitrobenzene in a total yield of 68%.
After hydrogenation catalyzed by the Fe/HCl (yield almost
100% without additional purification), the nitro group
was reduced into amino. The intermediate 5-(benzyloxy)2-(5-(benzyloxy)-2-iodophenoxy) aniline was further
reacted by K2CO3 and DMEDA to afford the product 2,
8-bis(benzyloxy)-10H-phenoxazine (yield 79%). Then
benzyl 4-chlorobutanoate was added to the reaction
mixture in present of K2CO3, after final hydrogenation
catalyzed by the H2 and Pd-C(yield almost 100%), the
compound PI003 was obtained. The high degree of
symmetry in these molecules enabled facile confirmation
by NMR techniques. The purity of all compounds was
above 97.0% determined by HPLC normalization method.
Furthermore, the structures of these compounds were
further verified by ESI-MS. All the spectra displayed a
very prominent peak corresponding to the compounds

RESULTS
In silico analysis of the PIM kinase family
network
Four heterogeneous types of evidence were
integrated and the likelihood ratios were used as
the reliability of individual dataset to infer PPIs by using
the Naïve Bayesian theorem (Figure 1A). We then used the
ROC curve to evaluate the performances of predictions. A
protein pair is predicted to be positive when its likelihood
ratio is above a particular cutoff, to be negative otherwise
(Figure 1B). To get an appropriate composite LR cutoff,
we plot the ratio of true positive to false positive (TP/FP)
as the function of the cutoff of likelihood ratio. We further
modified the globe human PPI into the PIM kinases PPI
(Figure 1C). 36 proteins were predicted to interact with
PIM1. Such as BMX, CDNIA, MDM2, STAT3 and PTPA
are all apoptotic proteins. 14 proteins interacted with
PIM2, like apoptotic protein NEMO and all PIM kinases
interacted with H90SB and BAD, which were involved in
apoptosis. BAD, affecting the level of heterodimerization
of Bcl-X(L), Bcl-2 and Bcl-W with BAX, were reported
been suppressed Ser112 phosphorylation by PIM kinases.
The results showed the creditability of our network. And
the PPI network was built for further research of miRNAPIM-other gene/protein pathways.

Molecular docking and MD simulations of PIM
kinases /PI003 complex
PI003 binds to the PIM kinases much better than P9
(Figure 3A). Of note, PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3 are highly
homologous at the amino acid level. There is a long and
narrow gap in the deep of the active pocket, which is the
key side of PIM kinases. PI003 as a “tail” with carboxyl
having Hydrogen bonding in the gap. To increase the
stability, two hydroxies are added to binding with oxygen
atoms outside of the gap. The hydroxies act like the key
to the active pocket that brings the good result of MD
simulations. As a pan-PIM inhibitor, the docking showed
that PI003 target PIM1 better and it can binding to PIM2
and PIM3.

As shown in Figure 3B, the MD simulations
were carried out for 10 ns for the three inhibitor-PIM
complexes. The RMSD values of PIM1, PIM2 and
PIM3 backbone atoms involving the initial minimized
structure, which plotted in Figure 3B, were calculated
through the phase of the simulation to evaluate the
reliable stability of the MD trajectories and the difference
of the stabilities in the MD simulations. All of inhibitorPIM complexes were found to reach equilibrium after
1 ns of the simulation phase. As showed in Figure 3,
the RMSD values read 1.2, 1.4 and 1.3 Å for the PIM1,
PIM2 and PIM3-inhibitor complexes, respectively, with
lower than 0.5 Å deviation. The study demonstrated
that the trajectories of the MD simulations were stable
after 1 ns for the three complexes, then the binding free
energy calculation and free energy decomposition could
be carried out on base of the snapshots extracted from
1 to 10 ns.
The binding free energies had been calculated
through the MM/GBSA method with the aid of the
single trajectory protocol. For analysis of the binding
free energy, the 450 snapshots were extracted at a time
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

interval of 20 ps from the 1 to 10 ns of MD trajectories.
The calculated binding free energies and components
were shown (Table 1). It showed that the binding free
energies of PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3-inhibitor complexes
were −43.69, −38.81 and −42.12 kcal/mol, respectively.
From Table 1, the intermolecular van der Waals and the
electrostatics interactions both play an important role
in binding, but polar salvation terms act oppositely.
Nonpolar solvation terms, corresponding to the burial of
SASA upon binding, are moderately favorable. In order
to further investigate the influence of the configuration on
the hydrogen bonding network, the visible percentage of
hydrogen bonds during the MD simulations was calculated
and the results was displayed (Table 1 and Table 2). The
inhibitory ratio of HeLa and C4-I cells treated with PI003
and P9 were carried out by MTT analysis and the effect
of PI003 gained remarkably both in HeLa and C4-I cells
(Figure 3C). The IC50 of PI003 were 3.23 μM and 5.38
μM in HeLa and C4-I cells, respectively. And the IC50 of
P9 were 6.34 μM and 10.97 μM. The inhibitory ratio of
HeLa cells is higher than C4-I cells, thereby HeLa cells
were selected for further studies.

PI003 induces apoptosis via the death-receptor
and mitochondrial pathways in HeLa cells

Moreover, we examined PI003 induced HeLa cell
apoptosis via both death-receptor and mitochondrial
pathways by western blot analysis (Figure 5). After
treatment with PI003, the levels of Fas, Fas L and FADD
were increased. For caspase family, pro-caspase 8 and
pro-caspase 3 were decreased, whereas the levels of
caspase 8 and caspase 3 were increased. PARP, substrate
of caspase 3, was observed a time-dependent cleaving
in PI003-treated HeLa cells. Then, we investigated the
involvements of Bax, pro-caspase 9 and caspase 9 in
PI003-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that
PI003 induces HeLa cell apoptosis via the death-receptor
and mitochondrial pathways. Interestingly, in the good
agreement with above-mentioned prediction (Figure 1C),
we found that p-Bad and Hsp90 were both decreased in
PI003-treated HeLa cells, indicating that PI003 may be
targeting PIM1/2/3-p-Bad/Hsp30 pathway in cancer cells.

Meanwhile, typical characteristics of apoptosis
were also observed in PI02-treated HeLa cells. These
apoptotic characteristic changes included chromatin
condensation and margination at the nuclear periphery
(Figure 4A). Hoechst 33342 staining also showed a higher
degree of apoptosis in the HeLa cells created with PI003
compared with the negative control (Figure 4B). When
PI003 was added, the change of subcellular localization
of phosphatidylserine was observed under fluorescence
microscope, which is a typical apoptotic feature
(Figure 4C). With remarkable reduce of DNA content, the
percentage increasing of HeLa cells death also measured
by flow cytometry (Figure 4D). Under the microscope,
typical apoptotic manifestation are observed.

PI003-induced apoptotic mechanism is mainly
dependent on PIM-1, but partially dependent on
PIM-2 and PIM-3

Based on the differentially expressed miRNAs, a SAM
analysis was used to compare the expression data of two
treated samples and two normal samples (Figure 7B). A
total of 35 upregulated and 2 downregulated miRNAs
were identified with statistical significance in the treated
samples.
Seven high conforming predicted miRNAs were
selected out, Combined with apoptic proteins in the PPI
of PIM kinases, the potential miRNA-PIM-gene pathways
were predicted. MiR-1273a, miR-1296, miR-1299 and
miR-664a-3p for PIM1 and miR-1273a, miR-1296, miR1299, miR-664a-3p, miR-1285–3p, miR-1226–3p and
miR-1224–3p for PIM2 were selected. And the interacted
genes which may play a role in PI003-induced apoptosis
and miRNA-PIM-gene/protein pathways were selected
(Figure 7C). Such as GSK3B, which has pro-apoptotic
effect through phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic
protein MCL1, may control cell apoptosis in response
to growth factors deprivation. To further study miRNA
involvements, we found that miR-1296 mimetic and miR1299 mimetic could remarkably decrease the expressions
of PIM1, suggesting that they negatively regulates
PIM1 and induces apoptosis in HeLa cells (Figure 8).
In addition, in PI003-treated HeLa cells, we found that

As a pan-PIM inhibitor, PI003 may target PIM1,
PIM2 and PIM3. To our best knowledge, PIM1 takes
the main effect of PIM kinases in cancer. So the PI003
was designed to target PIM1 mainly (Figure 6A). When
treated with PI003, caspase 3, 8 and 9 level showed
remarkable increasing and the level of PIM1 decreased.
But when PIM-1 siRNA added, PI003 cannot increase
the level of caspase 3, 8 and 9. When adding PIM-2
siRNA (Figure 6B) and PIM-3 siRNA (Figure 6C), PI003
partially increased caspase 3, 8 and 9. Thus, these results
suggest that PI003-induced apoptotic mechanism is mainly
dependent on PIM-1, but partially dependent on PIM-2
and PIM-3.

MiR-1296/miR-1299 could affect PIM1 and
STAT3 in PI003-indcued apoptosis
We utilized a miRNA microarray analysis to identify
miRNAs that were expressed in HeLa cells when treated
with PI003 and 70 miRNAs were identified (Figure 7A).

were affected by different doses of PI003 (P < 0.05), the
decrease of liver and kidney weights were not obvious. We
obtained identical results by directly measuring the tumor
volumes. In the three PI003 groups, the tumor volumes
were much smaller than the control group in all three doses
groups (Figure 9B). In according to the balance between
anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity, the median dose was used
as the optimum dose for treatment of tumor growth. In
addition, PI003 administration resulted in a statistically
significant increase in number of apoptotic bodies in the
tumor as visualized by TUNEL assay, suggesting that
PI003-induced tumor cell proliferation inhibition by
apoptosis (Figure 9C).

miR-1296 and miR-1299 mimetics could remarkably
decrease the expression of p-STAT3, which has been
predicted to interact with PIM1 Figure 8. Thus, these
results indicate that the two miRNAs can target PIM1mediated apoptotic pathway in HeLa cells.

effect of PI003 in vivo
Based on the anti-proliferative efficacy of PI003 on
HeLa cells in vivo, we proceeded to assess its efficacy on
inhibiting tumor growth in an orthotopic xenograft mouse
model of cervical cancer. In this experiment, we used three
different doses of PI003. Compared with the control group,
median and high doses of PI003 can induce the significant
body weight loss in nude mice in a dose dependent manner
(P < 0.001), while the toxicity of low dose PI003 was not
obvious (Figure 9A). At the end of the experiment, the
tumor weights decreased remarkably in median and high

kinases expression across different cancer types suggests
that PIM inhibitors may be a treatment modality for a
variety of cancer [14]. There no research of PIM inhibitors
for cervical cancer reported to date. It is a challenge to
discover inhibitors of PIM kinases in cervical cancer
therapeutics. When PIM1 was inhibited, PIM2 expression
increased across different cancer types generally, and Pim3 was reported to be aberrantly expressed in colon cancer
[15]. Taken together, designing pan-PIM inhibitor was
necessary for Pim-related cancer therapeutics.
In our study, we developed the Naïve Bayesian
model, which was well-suited to integrate these highthroughput data such as smallest shared biological
processes (SSBP), gene co-expression profiles, domaindomain interaction (DDI) and cross-species interolog
mapping for predicting protein functional connections;
thereby, constructing the PIM kinase network. It is wellknown that Naïve Bayesian model is used for constructing
the global PPI network, suggesting that this mathematics
model is advantageous for elucidating the global PPI
network in model organisms. Compared to previous
studies for the discovery of pan-PIM compounds, the
mechanism of PIM inhibitors induced apoptosis was

further identified. We identified more novel interacted
proteins with PIM kinases (PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3) and
further shed light on more molecular mechanisms of
PIM kinases in cancer. The other notable result is the
binding mode of PI003. Generally, the inhibitors bind to
the active site of AMP (Supplementary Figure S1), while
in PIM1-PI003 complex, PI003 had Pi interaction with
PHE49 and hydrogen bond interaction with GLU89. This
binding mode can be used to aid in the design of specific
inhibitors of PIM inhibitors.
In this study, FDA-approved small-molecule
compounds were screened for candidate drugs and
PI003 was modified from the best one, P9, and more
hydrogen bonds were formatted to increase the stability.
Compared with other pan-PIM inhibitors, such as
7-(4H-1,2,4-Triazol-3-yl)benzo[c] [2, 6] naphthyridines
and pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-based Pim inhibitors
PI003, modified from a FDA-approved drug, had more
druggability [16, 17]. A series of experimental data have
demonstrated that PI003-induced apoptosis was the
death-receptor and mitochondrial pathways in HeLa cells.

PIM kinases. This results were carried out for the first time
and may be experimentally verified in miRNA level. For
instance, PIM2 target miRNA, miR-1226–3p, which was
verified by NGS (http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/), was
in one of our predicted miRNA-PIM-gene pathways. For
instance, we predicted miR-1296/miR-1299-PIM1-STAT3
pathway, and thus validated the two miRNA mimetic to
inhibit the expressions of PIM1 and p-STAT3 in PI003induced apoptosis of the HeLa cells. This work may shed
light on the further research on the combinations of panPIM kinases and miRNA drugs in future cancer therapy.
Moreover, in our study, we also found that PI003 bear the
good anti-tumor activities, and also induced apoptosis
in vivo. It may provide a board perspective for utilizing
PI003 as a potential anti-tumor drug targeting PIMs in the
near future.
In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that
PI003, as a novel synthesized pan-PIM inhibitor, induces
the death-receptor and mitochondrial apoptosis involved
in some microRNA regulation, and also possessed
remarkable anti-tumor activity and apoptosis-inducing

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Network construction
To build the protein-protein interaction (PPI)
network of PIM kinases, we collected a diverse of
datasets from online databases. The globe network data
were from Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD)
[23], Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND)
[24], the Database of Interacting Proteins [25], Munich
Information center for Protein Sequences [26], IntAct
[27] and PrePPI [28]. Then, we applied a Naïve Bayesian
model to integrate diverse data and thus making the final
interaction predictions in a systematic way [29]. Following
the Naïve Bayesian theorem, we compute the posterior
odds given n evidence as follows:
Oposterior =
8030

P(positive|E1, …, En)
P(negative|E1, …, En)
Oncotarget

Where positive means that two proteins are functional
related while negative means not.
P(E1, …, En|positive)
We define LR1E1, …, En2 =
then
P1E1, …, En|negative)
Oposterior = Oprior × LR.

and then10ul of MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to cells in each
well. After 4 h of culture, the medium was removed, and
the blue formazan crystals that had formed were dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide. The absorbency of formazan
generated from MTT was measured at 570 nm (BioRad Model 680, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) [31, 32].
The inhibitory ratio (%) = (OD490, control − OD490,sample)/
(OD490,control − OD490,blank)*100.

As Naive Bayesian model supposes that each
evidence is conditional independent, we can simplify LR as
LR1E1, …, En2 = q LR(Ei)
n

Chemical synthesis

i=1

All reactions requiring anhydrous conditions were
performed under an Ar or N2 atmosphere. Chemicals and
solvents were either A.R. grade or purified by standard
techniques. Thin layer chromatography (TLC): silica gel
plates GF254; compounds were visualized by irradiation
with UV light and/or by treatment with a solution of
phosphomolybdic acid (20% wt. in ethanol) followed
by heating. Column chromatography was performed by
using silica gel with eluent given in parentheses. 1H NMR
analysis was performed using CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 as
a solvent at room temperature. The chemical shifts are
expressed in relative to TMS (=0 ppm) and the coupling
constants J in Hz. The purity of compound screened in
biological assays was determined to be ≧ 97% by HPLC
analysis with a photodiode array detector, An atlantis C18
(150mm × 4.6mm, i.d. 5 μm) (Waters, Milford, Mass,
USA) was used with a gradient elution of methanol and
HPLC-grade water as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/
min [33, 34].

A likelihood ratio (LR) corresponding to a specific
biological evidence (Ei) was used to measure the
predictive power or confidence degree, and calculated
as the ratio of the true positive rate (TPR) to the falsepositive rate (FPR), where TPR = |Ei⊂PRS|/|PRS| and
FPR = |Ei⊂NRS|/|NRS|. In theory, LR (Ei) > 1 indicates
that the biological evidence Ei is capable of identifying
the true positives from a test. The LR was calculated
from four evidences: (A) Interology mapping of 6 model
organisms. (B) Gene co-expression data calculated from
high quality large-scale microarray datasets. (C) Domaindomain interaction data from PrePPI. (D) Smallest shared
biological processes that quantify protein biological
process similarity. Based on these evidences, best
predicted proteins are chosen by preset scores. And a ROC
curve allows us to explore the relationship between the
sensitivity and specificity of a binary classifier system for
a variety of different cut points [30].

Molecular docking

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations

FDA-approved small molecule compounds from
the latest version of DrugBank (http://www.drugbank.
ca/) were downloaded to construct the screening
library for PIM kinases. In addition, we used Accelrys
Discovery Studio version 3.5 (Accelrys Inc., USA) with
CHARMm force-field parameters to dock pre-generated
conformations of drugs into PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3 for
virtually screening potential candidate inhibitors.  
We
performed flexible-ligand docking to a rigid receptor with
grid-based scoring, in which drugs were allowed to be
flexible and structurally rearranged in response to PIM1,
PIM2 and PIM3. The P1-P20 were selected based on their
scores and structures.

MD simulations were performed with GROMACS
(version 4.5.5) software package [35] to monitor the
binding states between PIM kinases and PI003. The
topology parameters of ligands were built by the Dundee
PRODRG server [36]. The topology of PIM kinases was
edited by Amber force field 99SB and the small molecule
was edited by Amber general force field. The complexes
were immersed in a cubic box of simple point charge
(SPC) water molecules. Eight and eleven sodium counterions were added by replacing water molecules to ensure
the overall charge neutrality of the receptors simulated
system, respectively. In this MD process, 1 ns simulations
with a time step of 10 ns were performed, and the resulting
trajectory files were viewed and analyzed using VMD
software [37].

Cell culture and the MTT assay
The HeLa cells and C4-I cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10%
(v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and incubated
in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. HeLa cells and
C4-I cells were transferred to 96-well plates at a density of
approximately 5.0 × 104 cells/mL. Cytotoxicity induced by
the test compounds were measured using the MTT assay
as follows: The HeLa cells and C4-I cells were cultured in
DMEM in the presence of 30 μM test compound for 24 h

Apoptosis detection
The ultrastructure of cell apoptosis was observed
under an electron microscope (Hitachi 7000, Japan).
Hoechst 33342 staining and Annexin V-FITC staining
were performed to detect apoptosis. For Hoechst
33342 staining, A549 cells were washed with PBS and
stained with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/ml in PBS) at room

temperature for 20 min, the fluorescence was observed by
a fluorescence inverted microscopy. For Annexin V-FITC
staining, the treated cells were collected, washed and then
stained with Annexin V-FITC or PI at room temperature
for 15 min. The percentage of apoptotic cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, Franklin
Lakes, NJ) [38–40].

thoroughly rinsed with deionized water to remove any
residual ethanol. Next, the microarray slides were fully
submerged in an abundant amount of pre-hybridization
solution (5X SSPE, 0.1% SDS, and 1% BSA) for
1 hr at 42°C. After 1 hr, slides were transferred to roomtemperature distilled water and washed gently for 2 min.
Slides were spun dry for 2 min and stored in a dry and
dark place until hybridization.
10 μg of cRNA was fragmented by using RNA
Fragmentation Reagent kit (AM#8740, Ambion Inc.,
Austin, Texas, USA), and then denatured in a PCR
machine at 95°C for 5 minutes and held at 60°C.
Fragmented cRNA was hybridized on the rice OneArray®
(Phalanx Biotech Group, Taiwan) at 50°C for 14–16
hrs. After hybridization, the microarrays were washed
sequentially in 2X SSC containing 0.2% SDS solution for
5 min at 42°C, 2X SSC for 5 min at 42°C, and 2X SSC
for 5 min at room temperature. Finally, the microarrays
were spun dry with a centrifuge for at least one minute and
stored dry in the dark until ready for scanning [41].
The significant analysis of microarray (SAM)
method was used to perform the unsupervised calculation.
The statistical technique is based on a t-test for finding
significant miRNAs in a set of microarray experiments
and was proposed [42]. A hierarchical clustering of the
differentially expressed miRNAs was performed with
Cluster 3.0 (http://bonsai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/
cluster/software) version using the average linkage
algorithm. The top scoring pair (TSP) algorithm was
used to perform the supervised calculation [43]. The
basic principle of the k-TSP is to identify miRNA pairs
that are oppositely expressed (one upregulated and one
downregulated) in two classes. All numerical analyses
that are presented were performed using Matlab 7.0
(MathWorks Company, Natick, MA, USA).
Target miRNAs that bound to PIM kinases were
predicted using miRWalk, a database on predicted and
validated microRNA targets, so did the predicted targets
of miRNAs [44]. Data from 9 databases (DIANA-mT
[45], miRanda [46], PICTAR5 [47], miRDB [48], PITA
[49], miRWalk [50], RNA22 [51], RNAhybrid [52]
and TargetScan [53]) was used for identifying the high
conforming predicted miRNAs. The potential miRNAPIM-gene/protein pathways were predicted by the
combining of the predicted targets of conforming miRNAs
and the apoptotic proteins in PPI network of PIM kinases.

Western blot analysis
Cellular proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer
(SolarBio, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl 1%
(v/v) NP-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) containing 1% (v/v) PMSF
(SolarBio), 0.3% (v/v) protease inhibitor (Sigma) and
0.1% (v/v) phosphorylated proteinase inhibitor (Sigma).
Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 15
min and the supernatant was collected for total protein.
A BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) was used to determine
the protein concentration. Equal amounts of protein
(15 μg) was separated on an SDS-PAGE gel (10% (v/v)
polyacrylamide) and transferred onto a PVDF membrane.
Nonspecific binding was blocked using 8% (w/v) milk
in TBS-T for 2 hr at room temperature. The membranes
were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight
at 4°C. After several washes with TBS-T, the membranes
were incubated in HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and
anti-mouse IgG or HRP-conjugated mouse anti-goat
IgG (Abmart, all at a 1:5000 dilution) for 2 hr at room
temperature and then washed. The target proteins were
visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Millipore)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, and
quantified using density analysis normalized against
GAPDH to the manufacturer’s recommendations, and
expressed as the fold-change compared to control.

SiRNA and miRNA transfection
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against human
PIM-1, PIM-2 and PIM-3, and control siRNA were
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). MiR-1296
mimetic and miR-1299 mimetic were purchased from
Sigma. The HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs
at 33 nM final concentration using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For the miRNA transfection, HeLa cells were transfected
with miR-1296 mimetic and miR-1299 mimetic at 100
nM final concentration using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The transfected cells were used for
subsequent experiments 24 h later.

Mouse experiments and tumor xenograft model
The Institutional Animal Care and Treatment
Committee of No.150 Central Hospital of PLA approved
all studies herein. 24 healthy female nude mice (BALB/c,
6–8 weeks of age, non-fertile and 18–20 g each) were
injected subcutaneously with HeLa cells (1 × 107cells/
mouse). When the tumors reached 100 mm3 in volume
(calculated as V = L × W2/2). The mice were divided into
four groups. Three groups were treated with different dose

MicroRNA microarray and SAM analysis
Human OneArray® microarrays were pre-heated at
60°C for 10 min in hybridization oven. Microarray slides
were placed inside a falcon tube containing 100% ethanol,
incubated for approximately 15 sec, shaken for 20 sec, and
