ALK-Positive Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer
Mechanisms of Resistance and Emerging Treatment Options
Conor E. Steuer, MD; and Suresh S. Ramalingam, MD

Targeted therapy has emerged as an effective treatment option for certain molecular subsets of advanced stage non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). The discovery of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4–anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK)
translocation as an oncogenic driver has led to the development of novel therapies with activity in vitro and in the clinic. The first-inclass tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib is effective against ALK-positive NSCLC and is currently used as first-line or salvage therapy
in the setting of advanced disease. However, resistance inevitably develops through a variety of mechanisms, including point mutations affecting the fusion protein, activation of bypass signaling pathways, copy number gain of ALK, and other means. Increased
understanding of these pathways is essential for tailoring treatment choices to improve outcomes and minimize toxicities. Potent
second-generation ALK inhibitors currently in trials are producing encouraging results in ALK-positive NSCLC, even in patients with
acquired resistance to crizotinib. The success in identifying the ALK translocations and rapidly developing targeted drugs to exploit it
paves the way for a better understanding of NSCLC biology and the quest to provide effective, personalized treatment for lung

INTRODUCTION
Decades of research have succeeded in broadening treatment options for those diagnosed with lung cancer. Unfortunately,
the disease remains as the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. The current estimated number of new cases of lung cancer in 2013 is approximately 230,000 in the United States alone, with deaths from the disease estimated at 160,000.1 Since
the 1990s, the treatment of stage IV non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a platinum-based doublet backbone has
remained relatively unchanged.2 Chemotherapy provides modest improvements in survival for advanced NSCLC, but the 5year survival rate is dismal at <5%. Recent advances in the understanding of NSCLC biology and the genetic aberrations
contributing to pathogenesis and resistance to treatment have moved us to an era of targeted therapy. The first such therapy
proven effective in NSCLC was the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which had
significant activity against NSCLC tumors harboring a mutation in EGFR.3 In 2007, Soda and colleagues described a rearrangement in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene in 4% of NSCLCs (Table 1). Inversion in the short arm of chromosome 2 fuses the N-terminal domain of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein like 4 (EML4) to the intracellular
kinase domain of ALK, resulting in a fusion gene that causes constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase, which is implicated
in uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation.4 Patients with EML4-ALK–positive NSCLC tend to be younger and are more
likely to be never smokers than those without the ALK rearrangement. In the study by Kwak et al of 82 patients with EML4ALK NSCLC, the median age was 51 years, and 76% of patients were never smokers.23 Unlike the case with EGFR mutation, the prevalence of ALK gene rearrangement appears to be comparable between Caucasian and Asian patients.
The current gold standard for testing for the EML4-ALK translocation is fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).
However, given the labor-intensive nature and cost of the test, there has been interest in validating other screening and
diagnostic tools. Immunohistochemistry has demonstrated potential in screening for ALK-positive NSCLC but is not yet
standard practice.24 Researchers quickly identified 2 TKIs with activity against the EML4-ALK translocation in NSCLC
cell lines: TAE684 and PF02341066 (Pfizer Inc., New York, NY), of which the latter is approved by the US Food and

Drug Administration (FDA) as crizotinib. In 1 of the first
studies to evaluate such compounds, Koivunen et al examined the effectiveness of TAE684 and evaluated the frequency of the EML4-ALK translocation in primary
NSCLC samples collected from the United States and
Korea. Screening of 83 NSCLC lines for the ALK translocation identified 3 candidate cell lines. Treatment with
TAE684 inhibited growth in only 1 of these cell lines;
however, apoptosis was induced in a second line with the
addition of an EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor. In a survey of
167 tumor samples in patients of Korean origin, 6
patients (3%) had the EML4-ALK fusion gene, whereas
only 2 of 136 patients (1%) in the US cohort were positive
for the ALK translocation.5 Although in vitro inhibition
of EML4-ALK did not produce the same effectiveness
that was observed in early EGFR inhibitor studies, the
study demonstrated the potential for TKI treatment in
the cohort of patients with EML4-ALK translocation.

FDA approval for the treatment of patients with ALKpositive NSCLC. Initially developed as a c-Met inhibitor,
crizotinib is a small molecule that competitively inhibits
the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding domain of
ALK kinase. Its FDA approval was based on impressive
phase 1 clinical data initially published in 2011 by Kwak
et al and later updated by Camidge et al in 2012. In that
study, from August 2008 to June 2011, investigators
recruited 149 patients who had ALK-positive lung cancer
detected by FISH to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
response rates to crizotinib therapy. Equal numbers of
men and women were enrolled; 71% were never-smokers,
85% had received prior treatment, and 88% were relatively fit with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0 or 1. All enrolled patients received
oral crizotinib 250 mg twice daily for 28-day cycles, with
tumor response measured every 2 months using Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The
most recent update reported that, of 143 evaluable
patients, 87 patients (60.8%) had an objective response,
whereas 118 patients achieved disease control. The median time to response was approximately 8 weeks, and the

median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.7 months.
In addition to these impressive response data, crizotinib
was tolerated well with few grade 3 or 4 adverse events.25
The rates of the most prevalent adverse events associated
with crizotinib are provided in Table 2. It should be noted
that, although not reported in these studies, crizotinib has
uniquely been associated with hypogonadism in men.28
Recently, results from the first phase 3 randomized
trial comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy in patients
with the ALK translocation were published by Shaw et al.
In that study, 347 patients who had received frontline
therapy with a platinum-based regimen were randomized
to receive either crizotinib 250 mg twice daily or standard
salvage therapy with either pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 or
docetaxel 75mg/m2, with a primary endpoint of PFS. The
median PFS was 7.7 months with crizotinib versus 3
months with chemotherapy, and the overall response rates
(ORRs) for crizotinib versus chemotherapy were 65% versus 20%, respectively. That study demonstrated clear superiority for crizotinib over salvage chemotherapy as
second-line therapy in ALK-positive NSCLC. It is also
interesting to note that pemetrexed had a better efficacy
profile over docetaxel with an ORR of 29% versus 7%
and a PFS of 4.2 months versus 2.6 months, respectively.26 The increased efficacy of pemetrexed in this molecular subset of patients also was demonstrated in other
retrospective studies.29,30 Clinical trials are currently
ongoing to help define the role of pemetrexed in
2394

ALK-positive NSCLC. One example is an investigation of
the role of pemetrexed in the crizotinib-resistant setting in
a study by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) (Fig.
1). Studies on the mechanism of pemetrexed’s efficacy in
this patient population are ongoing. The current focus is
the effect of pemetrexed on enzymes of nucleotide synthesis in the context of ALK activation, such as thymidylate
synthase or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC).31,32 Nonetheless, in routine clinical
settings, crizotinib is considered the preferred first-line
therapy for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. A phase
3 trial is currently ongoing to compare crizotinib with
platinum-based combination therapy in the first-line setting; however, in the United States, the FDA approval of
crizotinib is not restricted to any specific line of therapy in
patients with advanced-stage disease.
Despite the robust activity of crizotinib in ALKpositive NSCLC, patients eventually develop drug resistance. Currently, the median time to progression on crizotinib is approximately 10 months. Over the last 2 years,
significant advances have been made in determining the
mechanisms of crizotinib resistance. In addition, there
remains the clinical question of how best to treat patients
once they no longer respond to the medication. Several
ongoing trials aim to answer this question with a variety of
newer targeted therapies that appear to be promising for
the future of crizotinib-resistant, EML4-ALK-positive
NSCLC.
Mechanisms of Resistance

The development of resistance to crizotinib has similarities with other targeted therapies. EGFR-mutated lung
cancers develop TKI resistance in approximately the same
time intervals as ALK-rearranged lung cancers. In approximately 50% of patients, EGFR TKI resistance can be
traced to a single point mutation: the substitution of methionine for threonine at amino acid position 790
(T790M).33 This “gatekeeper” mutation appears to confer a preference for binding of mutated EGFR to ATP
instead of gefitinib or other TKIs because of steric hindrance of the small-molecule inhibitor. Chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) is a disease also driven by a specific chromosomal translocation, breakpoint cluster region/Abelson tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL). This oncogenic hybrid
protein can undergo a similar gatekeeper substitution at
its 315 position, T315L.34 However, these represent just
2 mechanistic examples that do not fully account for
acquired resistance in either disease. Likewise, although

In this study, mutations were induced through in vitro mutagenesis screens.

resistance in ALK-positive NSCLC is still in its early stage,
recent studies indicate that the development of crizotinib
resistance is an etiologically diverse process (Table 3 and
Figure 2).
Initial mechanistic insight into crizotinib resistance
was provided in 2010 when Choi et al identified 2 distinct
mutations conferring resistance. Both mutations were
observed in a single patient who was diagnosed with metastatic NSCLC, treated with standard therapy, and later
enrolled in a clinical trial of crizotinib when identified as
ALK-positive. On the trial, the patient responded for
5 months before ultimately progressing. By using deep
sequencing techniques, researchers analyzed sequential
pleural fluid samples collected throughout the trial and
ultimately validated 2 de novo point mutations in EML4ALK: C1156Y and L1196M. Introducing these mutations into the EML4-ALK-positive BA/F3 mouse cell line
induced resistance to crizotinib. Furthermore, protein
structure modeling revealed that L1196M added a new
bulky residue in the ATP-binding domain, sterically hindering TKI binding and, thus, acting as a “gatekeeper” resistance mutation, similar to that caused by T790M in
EGFR and T315L in BCR-ABL. The role of C1156Y in
facilitating resistance was less obvious, but the authors
hypothesized that it could also cause allosteric hindrance
of TKI binding. Discovery of these mutations was encouraging, in that it identified mechanisms of resistance that
could possibly be bypassed, thus providing appealing targets for future drug development.35
However, in 2011, 2 subsequent studies demonstrated that the mechanisms underlying crizotinib resistance involved more factors than just L1196M and
C1156Y. When Sasaki et al performed sequencing on a
tumor sample from a crizotinib-resistant patient, a novel
mutation in EML4-ALK with a leucine to arginine switch
at position 1152 was noted. When the authors introduced
this mutation into the lung cancer cell line H3122 and
2396

BA/F3 cells, it conferred resistance to both crizotinib and
TAE684. However, much like with C1156Y, structural
modeling was not able to fully explain the mechanism
behind L1152R-induced resistance. The investigators
studied this problem further, developing TKI-resistant
H3122 cells by gradually increasing exposure to TAE684
over the course of months. Treatment with crizotinib
demonstrated that the TKI-resistant cells were able to
bypass ALK inhibition by up-regulating EGFR signaling
through the release of EGFR ligands; notably, these cells
were sensitive to crizotinib with concurrent EGFR blockade. Moreover, screening of 50 tumor biopsy samples
from crizotinib-naive patients with ALK-positive NSCLC
revealed EGFR mutations in 3 patients.36 This raises the
pertinent clinical question of whether such patients
should receive treatment with an EGFR inhibitor in addition to ALK inhibition to subvert this resistance mechanism and, if so, then at what time point.
Heuckmann et al further demonstrated the diversity
of mutations that may lead to crizotinib resistance in addition to illustrating that certain resistance mechanisms may
determine response to second-line therapy as well. The
first aspect of their study demonstrated that cells harboring a variety of previously noted mutations that conferred
resistance to crizotinib retained sensitivity to TAE684, a
structurally distinct ALK inhibitor. This suggested that alternative TKIs might prevail over the steric hindrance that
causes crizotinib resistance. Subsequently, the authors
used a mutagenesis screen to create new EML4-ALK resistance mutations that demonstrated various sensitivities
to the 2 small-molecule inhibitors. Then, they used structural modeling to investigate how each mutation could
interact with different ALK inhibitors.37 Although it is
not clear how the engineered mutations may relate to in
vivo crizotinib resistance, these experiments highlight the
point that comprehending mechanisms of resistance will
allow for improved drug design and implementation.

Patients with ALK-positive disease remained on IPI-504 for approximately 7 months.

These studies were crucial in formulating the initial
understanding of the complex processes underlying crizotinib resistance, but they were largely limited to the in
vitro setting and an analysis of a small number of patient
samples. However, more recent work has examined larger
cohorts of TKI-resistant patients in an attempt to characterize resistance patterns. Doebele et al examined 11 biopsies from relapsed patients with ALK-positive tumors; for
most samples, the initial biopsy specimen also was available for comparison. In 4 specimens, an ALK kinase domain mutation was discovered: 2 samples had the
previously described L1196M gatekeeper mutation, and 2
had the novel mutation G1269A. The latter mutation was
validated as conferring resistance when introduced in vitro
and was hypothesized to substitute a bulky amino acid in
the ALK kinase domain based on structural modeling,
thereby likely inhibiting crizotinib binding. It is noteworthy that those authors also reported 3 patients who lost
ALK positivity by FISH. In 1 of those samples, resistance
was mediated by increased EGFR signaling, 1 was mediated through the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and the other had an unidentifiable
mechanism. Another sample also developed alternate activation signaling through a KRAS mutation (G12V). In
addition, 2 patients had ALK gene copy number gain,
which, for 1 of these patients, represented the only identifiable mechanism of resistance. In the final 2 patients, resistance to crizotinib remained unexplained.38
Katayama and colleagues performed a similar study
with tumor samples from 18 patients with advanced
ALK-positive NSCLC that had become resistant to crizotinib. In those samples, the authors were only able to
identify 4 patients who had genetic changes that could
explain TKI resistance. These included the known
L1196M mutation as well as the novel mutations
G1202R, S1206Y, and 1151T insertion. Their results
Cancer

August 15, 2014

demonstrated that the missense mutations likely cause
steric hindrance. However, the 1151T insertion mutation is not located near the binding site for crizotinib.
This off-active site could function in the same manner as
that hypothesized for the C1156Y mutation, potentially
by allosterically regulating the binding site.41 The
authors confirmed that introducing these mutations in
BA/F3 cells imparted resistance to crizotinib, and they
studied those cells’ sensitivity to next-generation ALK
TKIs and the heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor
17AAG, which had demonstrated effectiveness against
EML4-ALK NSCLC. Differential sensitivity was noted to
the various TKIs, and all cell lines were sensitive to the
Hsp90 inhibitor. When examining tumors without an
identifiable EML4-ALK mutation, the authors observed
evidence of bypass signaling pathways involving EGFR
and v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT), a known tyrosine kinase that often
is up-regulated in cancers. However, the extent to which
these alternate pathways contribute to crizotinib resistance
remains unclear.39
Novel Therapies for Crizotinib-Resistant NSCLC

The existing body of work in this field has demonstrated
that, although crizotinib resistance is an eventuality, the
mechanism by which it develops may vary. Whereas the
gatekeeper L1196M is most commonly identified, at
least 7 other ALK genetic alterations have been described
in addition to ALK copy number gain and bypass signaling through EGFR, KIT, and KRAS. With the need
emerging for second-line therapy, several compounds are
now under development and have produced promising
results in early phase clinical trials (Table 4). Because crizotinib was initially developed as a C-Met kinase inhibitor and only later was discovered to have activity against
the EML4-ALK fusion protein,49 it stands to reason that
2397

Review Article

4 of the drugs currently under investigation are TKIs
with more potent activity against EML4-ALK than crizotinib. Hsp90 inhibitors represent another class of drugs
that have been evaluated in the treatment of a variety of
cancers and have demonstrated shown good efficacy
against NSCLC with ALK mutations.
One of the promising new drugs is LDK378 (Novartis Corporation, New York, NY), a small-molecule ALK inhibitor that is currently in phase 2 and 3 trials. Unlike
crizotinib, LDK378 specifically inhibits the ALK fusion
protein and is not active against C-Met. In preclinical studies, LDK378 caused full tumor regression in H228 rat
xenograft models and exhibited a good safety profile.50
These findings led to a phase 1 clinical trial. Shaw and colleagues enrolled 123 adult patients with advanced ALKpositive NSCLC that had progressed on standard therapy.
Those patients were treated with a dose-escalation design,
with 114 evaluable patients receiving daily doses ranging
from 400 mg to 750 mg of study drug. In these patients,
the ORR was 58%, the median response duration was 8.2
months, and PFS was 8.6 months. In the patients who were
known to be resistant to crizotinib (n 5 79), the ORR
remained at 57%. The main side effects were nausea, fatigue, and diarrhea.42 These impressive results led LDK378
to receive breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA in
March 2013 to expedite clinical development. Phase 2 and
3 trials are currently underway to evaluate LDK378 in the
setting of crizotinib-naive and crizotinib-resistant advanced
NSCLC.
CH5424802/RO5424802 (Chugai/Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) is another small-molecule inhibitor of
EML4-ALK that is currently under evaluation. Preclinical
data have demonstrated that CH5424802 specifically
inhibits mutated EML4-ALK at a higher potency than crizotinib. It is noteworthy that this drug has demonstrated
significant activity in Ba/F3 cell lines harboring the most
common mutations known to cause crizotinib resistance,
including L1196M, C1156Y, and F1174L. In addition,
CH5424802 caused marked tumor regression in xenograft models with L1196M-mutated ALK-EML4,
whereas crizotinib remained ineffective.51 Based on these
efficacy data, the compound quickly advanced to clinical
trials. The phase 1 trial—a multicenter, open-label study
conducted in Japan—evaluated a maximum dose of
CH5424802 of 300 mg twice daily in 24 patients with
ALK-positive NSCLC who had received at least 2 prior
chemotherapy regimens. Patients were excluded if they
had received previous ALK inhibition. Overall, the medication was well tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxicity
was noted. Of 20 patients who had measurable tumors,
2398

17 had at least a partial response (PR).43 Thus, 300 mg
twice daily was the dose chosen for the phase 2 trial, which
enrolled 46 crizotinib-naive patients. Of that cohort, 7
patients (15%) had a complete response, and 93.5% of
patients overall had an objective response. It is noteworthy
that all 14 patients who had brain metastasis at baseline
with no prior history of radiation or surgery had at least
stable disease in the central nervous system (CNS). This
finding is especially encouraging, because the CNS is a
common relapse site in patients who receive treatment
with crizotinib. The drug was well tolerated at the chosen
dose, and the most common side effects were dysgeusia,
increased liver enzymes, increased creatinine, and rash.44
To further generalize the use of CH5424802 across populations, a phase 1/2 trial is currently accruing in the
United States.52 In this recently reported study, the phase
1 portion has completed with 45 patients, all of whom
have crizotinib-refractory disease. The side-effect profile
was similar to that in the crizotinib-naive study, and the
recommended phase 2 dose was 600 mg twice daily. In 37
evaluable patients, an ORR of 59% was reported. The
phase 2 study is currently ongoing.45
AP26113 (Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge,
Mass) is another small-molecule inhibitor of EML4-ALK
currently in clinical trials. Although the phase 1/2 study is
still accruing, there is another unique aspect of this drug
that makes it an appealing treatment for EML4-ALK–
mutated tumors. Much like the other second-generation
ALK inhibitors, AP26113 demonstrated potent preclinical efficacy and selectivity against EML4-ALK, even in the
presence crizotinib-resistant mutations.53 However,
AP26113 also has exhibited activity against the activated
EGFR receptor in NSCLC lines and xenograft models.
This inhibitory effect even held in EGFR receptors harboring the T790M TKI-resistance mutation.54 Thus,
AP26113 may serve a dual purpose in treating EML4ALK NSCLC by directly inhibiting the fusion protein in
addition to curbing the EGFR signaling up-regulation
that could lead to treatment resistance. As of April 2013,
55 patients had been enrolled in the study. Increased alanine aminotransferase levels and dyspnea have been noted
as dose-limiting toxicities, and the most common grade 3
and 4 adverse events were pneumonia. Fifteen of 24 evaluable patients with ALK-positive NSCLC demonstrated
objective responses. This was observed in both crizotinibnaive and crizotinib-refractory patients. In addition, 4 of
5 patients with CNS disease at baseline had an improvement in their CNS disease while on treatment with
AP26113. The phase 2 study dose was determined to be
180 mg daily. The trial will examine both crizotinibCancer

with ALK wild-type NSCLC who have EGFR mutations
that are resistant to available TKIs.46
TSR-011 (Tesaro Inc., Waltham, Mass) is an ALK
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is currently very early in development. It has a high affinity for the ALK kinase domain with a Kd of 0.36 nanomolars. Its preclinical data
exhibit strong potency against both crizotinib-naive and
crizotinib-resistant cell lines and xenograft models. It also
reportedly has efficacy against recombinant tropomyosin
receptor kinases (TRK). A phase 1/2a trial is currently
accruing with no data yet available.55
Hs90 Inhibition

Inhibition of Hsp90 represents another novel approach
for treating EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC tumors. Hsp90
Cancer

August 15, 2014

is a molecular chaperone that assists in proper protein
folding, stabilization, and function.56 It has been observed
that many of the proteins to which it binds (known as
“clients”) are involved in signaling pathways required for
oncogenesis, leading to the development and study of
Hsp90 inhibitors in cancer treatment. Hsp90 inhibitors
reportedly have been effective against EML4-ALK
NSCLC, among other molecularly driven tumors. In preclinical data, Hsp90 inhibitors were effective against both
cell lines and xenograft models harboring the EML4-ALK
mutation.57
Initial studies of Hsp90 inhibitors in advanced
NSCLC demonstrated objective responses in patients
with an ALK fusion gene, confirming the preclinical
observations. Sequist et al conducted a phase 2 trial examining IPI-504 (Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge,
2399

Review Article

Mass), a potent inhibitor of Hsp-90, in patients with
advanced NSCLC who had progressed on EGFR inhibitor therapy. Two cohorts of patients were defined based
on the presence or absence of activating mutations in
EGFR. The study recruited 76 patients, and 5 demonstrated a PR to IPI-504. It is noteworthy that 3 patients
were identified who had ALK mutations, and 2 of those
patients had PRs; the third patient had stable disease.47
Similarly, a phase 2 study of the Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib (Synta Pharmaceuticals Corp., Waltham, Mass) also
was not designed to examine efficacy in ALK-translocated
NSCLC, but post-hoc analysis demonstrated significant
activity in this group. The trial enrolled 99 patients with
NSCLC into 3 cohorts based on mutation status: mutant
EGFR, mutant KRAS, or wild type for both. Patients
received 200 mg/m2 ganetespib weekly, with 1 week off
every 5 weeks until disease progression. Eight of 23 patients
in the wild-type cohort subsequently had EML4-ALK
mutations identified. Of this subset, 4 patients demonstrated a PR, 3 had stable disease, and 1 had progressive disease on treatment. Two additional patients were known to
be ALK positive before enrollment and had progressed on
crizotinib. These patients did not respond to ganetespib.48
On the basis of the encouraging subgroup analyses from
these 2 studies, a phase 2 study is currently accruing to
investigate ganetespib in ALK-positive NSCLC.58
Future Perspectives

The discovery of the EML4-ALK translocation and its importance in NSCLC is 1 of the most important advances
in the field over the past decade. The rapid acquisition of
scientific insight and drug development efforts has led to
the development of several novel agents. However, many
uncertainties remain about the future directions of ALKpositive NSCLC. One of these is the question of combination therapy. Crizotinib is currently being used as a single agent, and the second-line TKIs are currently being
studied in a similar fashion. This raises the issue of
whether treating with a multidrug regimen could help
protect against tumor resistance to the TKIs. An illustration of this is the demonstration that EGFR up-regulation
is a mechanism of resistance to crizotinib; and, theoretically, an EGFR inhibitor could help abrogate tumor resistance. This approach did demonstrate merit in several
preclinical studies5,36; and clinical trials using combination therapy, such as dacomitinib with crizotinib and
AUY922 (Hsp90 inhibitor) with LDK378, are currently
underway.59,60 Also, if better ways can be developed to
assess an individual’s mechanism of TKI resistance, then
treatment can be better personalized to the patient.
2400

In addition, when patients have an isolated area of progression but otherwise have good tumor control, local
therapy to the progressing lesion and continuation of crizotinib is a reasonable strategy. CNS metastasis is a common example of this. However, it is not yet known
whether continuing crizotinib after florid disease progression can be beneficial.61 Finally, the importance of the
ALK translocation and its effect on treatment remains
unclear in the setting of early stage disease. At this time,
only tumors in patients with advanced disease are tested
for EML4-ALK, and the potential for ALK smallmolecule inhibitors in early stage disease, such as adjuvant
therapy, has not yet been elucidated. Studies are currently
being developed to address this question, and their proposed study designs are provided in Figures 3 and 4.
Although much work still needs to be done, EML4-ALK
NSCLC is a clear success in the era of targeted therapy.
