ABSTRACT
Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is one of the key molecules to modulate collagen metabolism
in the skin. This study aimed to unravel the relationship between Cav-1 and collagen
levels in the aged skin, and also to evaluate a new role of anti-Cav-1 agent as a
collagen-modulating agent. A negative correlation between Cav-1 and collagen I (COL
I) was detected in chronologically aged skin of humans and mice, which was further
confirmed by Cav-1 knock-down or knock-out experiments. Next, we tested whether
methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) as a chemical Cav-1 inhibitor could be developed as a
collagen-modulating agent in the skin. Testing different conditions of MβCD injection
via the intra-dermal route revealed that 2.5% MβCD administered twice per week for
two months showed a potent COL I-up-regulating activity, leading to the increase of
skin thickness (P < 0.05) without adverse reactions such as skin fibrosis. In human
dermal fibroblasts, MβCD treatment induced up-regulated COL I and down-regulated
Cav-1, supporting the results of mouse experiments. Collectively, MβCD has a COL
I-enhancing activity in chronologically-aged skin, where Cav-1 acts as a brake in COL
I expression, suggesting its potential role for an anti-aging agent.

INTRODUCTION

In the skin, Cav-1 has been implicated in
pathological conditions of abnormal collagen expression.
Cav-1 level was decreased in the skin of scleroderma
or keloid, characterized by up-regulated expression of
dermal collagens [10-12]. Cav-1 was reported to exert
an inhibitory activity by modulating transforming growth
factor- β (TGF-β) signaling through its participation
in TGF-β receptor (TβR) internalization [10]. These
studies suggest that Cav-1 plays a brake role in collagen
expression in the skin or DFs. In contrast, Cav-1 was
reported to play an accelerator role by up-regulating
collagen I (COL I) via the TGF-β pathway in DFs or
Cav-1 transgenic mice [13, 14]. The conflicting results
concerning the expressional relationship between Cav-1
and collagens in the skin prompted us to evaluate Cav-1
level in chronologically-aged skin, which is supposed to
be an ideal model to unravel the relationship between their
expression levels. In relation with skin aging, reduced

Caveolins are principal integral membrane proteins
of caveolae, which comprise at least four proteins –
caveolin-1α, 1β (21–24 kDa), and -2 (20 kDa) – that are
co-expressed to form hetero-oligomeric complex in many
cells, whereas caveolin-3 (18 kDa) is muscle specific [13]. Besides their structural role, caveolins have a gatekeeping role in modulating various signaling molecules
localized to the membrane component [4, 5]. Interestingly,
Cav-1 was reported to play a critical role in the promotion
of cellular senescence [6, 7]. Cav-1 was increased in
senescent dermal fibroblasts (DFs), and over-expression
of Cav-1 induced premature cellular aging [8, 9]. Despite
evidence showing the crucial role of Cav-1 in cellular
senescence, few studies have been performed on the agedependent change of Cav-1 in the human and mouse skin
in vivo.

TGF-β/TβRs signaling is supposed to be critical for the
loss of COL I expression in chronologically-aged skin
[15]. Among the collagen families, COL I is the major
component to determine the total bulk of collagens and
tensile strength of the skin. With these backgrounds, we
focused on the modulation of COL I in studying a new
candidate molecule to modulate collagen levels in the skin.
Methyl-β-cyclodexrin
(MβCD),
which
is
synthesized by random methylation of β-cyclodextrin (CD), is a cholesterol-depleting agent that disrupts caveolae
by virtue of anti-Cav-1 activity [16]. CDs have been
widely used for foods, in drug delivery, in cosmetics, and
in chemicals, as well as agriculture and environmental
engineering, as they are very safe molecules to our body
[17]. The most common CDs are -α-CD, β-CD, and

γ-CD, having six, seven, and eight anhydroglucose units
in their ring structure, respectively [18, 19]. This study
evaluated whether MβCD has a potential to modulate COL
I level by its anti-Cav-1 activity in the skin, especially
chronologically-aged skin.

Figure 1: Cav-1 expression is negatively related with COL I expression in chronologically-aged human and mouse
skin. To compare the age-dependent change of Cav-1 and COL I, skin tissues were excised from the young humans (Y, n=4) and more

elderly persons (O, n=4). (A) RT-PCR, (B) real time-PCR, and (C) Western blot analysis followed by densitometric analysis (D) of Cav-1
and COL I proteins in the skin was performed. Next, age-dependent changes of mRNA levels checked by (E) RT-PCR and (F) real-time
PCR, and protein levels checked by (G) Western blot analysis followed by densitometric analysis (H) of Cav-1 and COL I proteins were
also studied in hairless mice from different age-groups of 6-months-old (6 Mo), 12-months-old (12 Mo), and 18-months-old (18 Mo),
respectively (n=4 for each age group). Statistical significance between age groups was analyzed using a t-test for human and a one-way
ANOVA for mouse, respectively. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. N.S.: no significant difference.

RESULTS

on experimental conditions, 3rd band could be detected
as a partial degradation product of COL I. In RT-PCR/
real-time PCR and Western blot analyses, Cav-1 was upregulated, but COL I was down-regulated, in the old-aged
group (n=4) compared to the young-aged group (n=4)
with statistical significance (Figure 1A-D). These agedependent changes in Cav-1 and COL I levels in humans
prompted a comparison of the levels in skin from mice
6-, 12-, and 18-months-of-age (n=4 for each age group),
respectively. The RT-PCR/real-time PCR and Western
blot analyses revealed up-regulation of Cav-1 and downregulation of COL I in skin from 12- and 18-month-old
mice, with the changes being more pronounced (but not
significantly different) in the latter (Figure 1E-H).

Cav-1 is up-regulated, but COL I is downregulated, in chronologically-aged skin of human
and mouse
To unravel the age-related changes in Cav-1 and
collagen levels in the skin, we compared the expression
levels of Cav-1 and COL I in the human skin from youngand old-aged groups. To quantify the relative mRNA
levels of Cav-1 and COL I, RT-PCR and real-time PCR
(RT-PCR/real-time PCR) were performed with the same
samples. Western blot analyses could detect two chains
of COL I protein bands (α1 and α2 chains). Depending

MβCD up-regulates COL I expression and

mice

Transfection with the Cav-1 small interfering
(si) RNA induced marked suppression of Cav-1 mRNA
expression up to 48 h after transfection, compared to nontransfected control human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs).
Under the same condition, COL I was up-regulated in the
Cav-1 siRNA transfected HDFs, showing the negative
correlation between Cav-1 and COL I in HDFs (Figures
2A and B). Next, Cav-1 knock-out experiment was
performed to confirm the result of Cav-1 knock-down
experiment. Cav-1 expression was completely abolished,
but COL I level was markedly up-regulated, in Cav-1 (-/-)
knock-out mice (n=4) compared to Cav-1 (+/+) littermates
(n=4) with a statistical significance (P < 0.001) (Figure
2C and D). A marked histological increase of dermal
thickness in H & E stained samples (Figure 2E) and upregulated collagen expression from Masson’s trichrome
stain (Figure 2E, arrow) were observed in the dermis of

The finding of a negative correlation between Cav-1
and COL I levels in chronologically-aged skin prompted
the examination of whether COL I expression could be upregulated in vivo by MBCD-mediated inhibition of Cav-1
expression. Twelve-month-old mice were used, based on
the results shown in Figure 1. To test the dose-dependency
of MBCD activity, hairless mice were divided into two
dose-groups of 1.25% MβCD and 2.5% MβCD, based on
preliminary optimal dose studies (data not shown), with
twice-weekly injections for two months. Determination of
mRNA levels revealed that 2.5% MβCD was more potent
than 1.25% MβCD in modulating activities of Cav-1 and
COL I expression (n=3 for each group) (Figure 3A and
B). Control mice (0) were injected with saline instead of
MβCD.

To find the optimal COL I-up-regulating activity
of 2.5% MβCD, different experimental conditions of
administration were tested by adjusting the duration or
frequency of injection. For duration testing, mice were
injected twice weekly for 1-3 months. Modulation of
Cav-1 and COL I mRNA was more prominent in the 2.5%
MβCD-injected group for 2-3 months, compared to control
or 2.5% MβCD-injected group for 1 month (n= 3 for each
group). There was no significant difference between two
months and three months of injection-duration in terms
of Cav-1 and COL I levels (Figure 3C and D). Next, to
ascertain the optimal injection-frequency, mice were
divided into three groups, which were injected with 2.5%
MβCD once a week (1x/W), twice a week (2x/W), and
three times a week (3x/W) for two months. Modulation of
Cav-1 and COL I mRNA was more remarkable with 2-3
injections each week (n=3 for each group) (Figure 3E and
F). There was no significant difference between injection
frequencies of two and three times weekly. Next, downregulated production of Cav-1 protein and up-regulated
production of COL I protein were evident, supporting

the mRNA results (Figure 4A and B). Marked histologic
increase of dermal thickness was observed in mice injected
with 2.5% MβCD for two months, compared to salineinjected control (n=3 for both groups, H & E stain) (Figure
4C, upper panel). The dermal layer was filled with blue
staining materials corresponding to collagens (n=3 for
both groups, Masson’s trichrome stain) (Figure 4C, lower
panel). In measuring skin thickness by a dial thickness
gauge, mice injected twice-weekly with 2.5% MβCD for
two months displayed an 25% increase in skin thickness
(125.0 ± 6.3%), compared to control mice (100.0 ± 10.4%)
(n=3 for each group, P < 0.05) (Figure 4D). The results
indicated that twice-weekly intra-dermal injection of 2.5%
MβCD for two months produced the optimal conditions as
an anti-aging activity of MβCD.

study, four MβCD-injected mice showed no abnormal
tissue fibrosis from H & E stain (Figures 5B) and no
increase of collagen expression from Masson’s trichrome
stain (Figure 5C). There was no change in skin texture
suggesting skin fibrosis, showing as a velvet as normal
skin upon palpation in MβCD-injected mice.

To rule out the possibility that intra-dermal injection
of MβCD could deleteriously modulate collagen levels in
systemic organs, we checked expression levels of Cav-1
and COL I in major internal organs of mice injected twiceweekly with 2.5% MβCD for three months (n=4). Control
mice were injected with sterile saline (n=4). MβCD did
not modulate mRNA levels of Cav-1 and COL I in liver,

MβCD-induced anti-aging activity persists for
several months after last injection in mouse skin

the COL I-up-regulating activity of MβCD in mouse
skin. RT-PCR/real-time PCR revealed up-regulated COL
I and down-regulated Cav-1 by MβCD treatment at 0.52.0 mM concentrations (Figures 6A and B). In enzyme
immunoassays for COL I, MβCD was revealed to upregulate COL I protein levels with a statistical significance
at 1.0-2.0 mM of MβCD (Figure 6C).

From the above results, MβCD can be developed
a novel anti-aging agent by up-regulating COL I level in
chronologically-aged skin. Thus, we tested the durability
of COL I-up-regulating activity as well as the possibility
of irreversible skin fibrosis, in MβCD-injected skin. To
test the durability of COL I-up-regulating activity of
MβCD, 2.5% MβCD was intra-dermally injected twiceweekly into mouse skin (n=3) for two months, and the
mice were kept for another two and four months after the

last injection. RT-PCR/real-time PCR demonstrated that
down-regulated Cav-1 expression as well as up-regulated
COL I expression were induced by MβCD injection for
two months. The MβCD-modulated Cav-1 and COL I
expressions were also observed at two months after the last
injection, but became less prominent as time lapsed after
the last injection, ruling out the possibility of irreversible
skin fibrosis (Figures 7A and B).

Skin aging is characterized by the gradual thinning
due to decreased total volume of the skin, and agedependent change of skin volume is mainly determined
by collagen levels in the dermis. In general, collagen
volume decreases around 30-years-of-age in the dermis
of humans. Therefore, anti-aging techniques should be
focused on enhancing skin volume by up-regulating
collagen expression in the dermis. In this study, MβCD has
a potential to be developed as a novel anti-aging agent by
up-regulating COL I expression level in HDFs or mouse
skin. The optimal COL I-enhancing activity of MβCD was
obtained by intra-dermal injection of 2.5% MβCD twice
weekly for at least two months in mice.
A variety of approaches to improve skin texture in
aged skin have been continuously developed. Replacement
of deficient collagens in chronologically-aged skin with
mammalian collagen products or synthetic collagen-mimic
agents has been applied, but unfortunately, this results in
allergic reaction due to the non-human materials [21, 22].
Hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal fillers have been used for
the aged skin, as they are biocompatible and safe, despite
being of non-biological origin. There are several forms of
HA dermal fillers depending on cross-linkers for HA to

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that decreased COL I
level in chronologically-aged skin is closely related with
elevated Cav-1 level. There was a negative correlation
between expression levels of Cav-1 and COL I in
chronologically-aged human and mouse skin in vivo. COL
I expression could be artificially up-regulated in Cav-1
siRNA transfected HDFs or Cav-1 knock-out mice, which
supports the previous reports on knock-down or knockout experiments [10, 20]. These results support the notion
that Cav-1 plays a brake role in COL I expression in the
skin. Consistently, Cav-1 was reported to be related with
cellular senescence of lung fibroblasts [7].

2.5% MβCD injection for 2 months, Cav-1 and COL I expression levels in the skin of hairless mice (2.5% MβCD, 2 Mo, n=3) were checked
by (A) RT-PCR and (B) real-time PCR. Also, Cav-1 and COL I levels were checked at time-lapse of 2 months (2 Mo after MβCD, n=3) and
4 months (4 Mo after MβCD, n=3) after the last injection of 2.5% MβCD, respectively. Statistical significance was analyzed using a oneway ANOVA, followed by post-hoc comparisons of group means using Tukey’s test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. N.S.: no significant difference.

prolong the durability of the filler [23], but they also have
limits for long-term maintenance as anti-aging agents.
Considering the average life-expectancy of mice (2 years)
compared to humans (80 years), MβCD is expected to
be a promising anti-agent agent with long-durability,
judging from our result that MβCD persists anti-aging
activity at least for two months in mice. As a potential
anti-aging agent, MβCD might be a more ideal agent
with several advantages. First, collagen synthesis can be
stimulated in the skin by inhibiting the action of Cav-1,
which is highly up-regulated in the chronologically-aged,
normal human skin. Second, foreign body reactions that
are frequently related with non-human collagens or fillers
can be avoided. Third, collagen (or HA) degradation by
collagenases (or hyaluronidases), which could be induced
by artificial collagens or HA dermal fillers, is not induced
by MβCD. Fourth, collagen expression level in the skin
can be controlled by adjusting injection-dose, injectionfrequency, and injection-duration of MβCD.	
CDs are relatively safe molecules for the skin and
systemic organs [17, 18, 24]. We did not observe any
remarkable adverse reactions including fibrosis in the skin
or systemic organs by intra-dermal injection of MβCD.
Considering that the average life expectancy of hairless
mice is approximately two years, three months of MβCD
injection may be long enough to verify the long-term
safety of MβCD in the body. The 2.5% MβCD used in this
study represents approximately 80 mg/kg/day, which is
considered to be fairly low dose in comparing with another
study [18]. In a standard battery of genotoxicity tests, none
of the tested CDs were genotoxic or mutagenic [18]. Our
results together with the safety profiles of studied CDs
indicate that MβCD as a CD derivative might be very safe
as a new anti-aging agent in human skin.
The COL I-up-regulating activity of MβCD exerted
as partly dose-dependent manners in relation with the
injection dose, duration, and frequency. However, the
MβCD-induced COL I-up-regulating activity was not
further enhanced by injection more than twice per
week or duration of injection longer than two months,
suggesting that the MβCD activity reaches a plateau
in the skin. Similar findings were observed in agedependent changes of Cav-1 and COL I levels, in that
there were no significant changes in Cav-1 and COL I
levels of mouse skin between 12- and 18-months-of-age.
We expect that COL I-up-regulating activity of MβCD
is more physiological than existing available anti-aging
techniques, such as administering fillers or botulinum
toxin [23, 25]. Development of anti-agent agents by
modulating collagen expression should be done with
caution, however, since the same mechanism might play
a crucial role in skin fibrosis [26]. Fortunately, MβCD is
supposed not to induce skin fibrosis or fibrosis of major
systemic organs of heart, lung, liver, and kidney from
our RT-PCR and H & E results. Physical examination
demonstrated that skin texture of MβCD-injected mice
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was normally velvety-smooth, implying that skin fibrosis
might not be induced by MβCD-injection. Furthermore,
our result that the COL I-up-regulating activity of MβCD
in mouse skin was decreased as time lapsed after last
injection of MβCD verifies that the COL I-enhancing
activity of MβCD is reversible.
In conclusion, MβCD is found to be a safe COL
I-up-regulating agent without serious adverse reactions
including skin fibrosis. Our results suggest that MβCD
can be developed as a novel anti-aging agent in the skin.
Further studies on long-term safety as well as durability
of anti-aging activity of MβCD in humans are warranted.
Inhibition of Cav-1 expression through anti-Cav-1 decoys
or skin-permeable anti-Cav-1 peptides instead of chemical
inhibitors can be a new strategy in developing anti-aging
agents in the skin [17].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experiments in humans and mice
Human samples from the abdomen were obtained
after informed consent according to the guidelines
of the local ethics committee of our hospital and the
Declaration of Helsinki Principles (IRB No.: 1-200911-136). For the old-aged skin, samples were obtained
from two individuals in their 70s and two individuals in
their 80s. For the young-aged skin, four teen-agers were
enrolled. For mouse experiments, official permission to
handle mice was obtained from the animal committee of
our university. SKH1 hairless mice were purchased from
the Orient Bio (Iksan, Korea). For experiments to study
age-dependent changes in Cav-1 and COL I levels, mice
were bred up to 6-, 12-, and 18-months-of-age. Anti-aging
activity of MβCD was studied in mice of 12-months-ofage. For knock-out experiments, female C57BL mice
target-mutated for Cav-1 were purchased from the Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).

Preparation of MβCD solution
MβCD was purchased from Tokyo Chemical
Industry (Tokyo, Japan). MβCD solution was prepared by
dissolving the chemical in sterile saline and injected into
the dermis of hairless mice using a 27-gauge needle to
deliver 100 µl of MβCD solution per injection (daily dose:
1.25-5.0 mg per mouse).

Preparation of protein and total RNA extracts
from the skin and HDFs

Transfection was carried using Oligofectamine
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) transfection reagent. Small
interfering RNA (siRNA) was designed against the
coding sequence of Cav-1 cDNA using software by
scitools (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville,
IA). CAV-1 siRNA sequence primers were forward,
5’-GCAUUAAGAGCUUCCUGAUUGAGAT-3’
and
reverse,
5’-AUCUCAAUCAGGAAGCUCUUAAUGCAU-3’.
Cells in 6-well plates at 50-60% confluency were
incubated with 3 ml of culture media lacking antibiotics
and containing 30 µl of Oligofectamine in the absence
and presence (30 μM) of Cav-1 siRNA. After 6 h, the
cells were washed in 1X PBS, and were cultured in new
DMEM lacking fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated
at 37oC in a CO2 incubator for 48 h until ready to assay for
gene knockdown.

The excised skin samples were immediately frozen
by liquid nitrogen and stored at -70oC until required for
experiments. Protein extracts and total RNAs from the
skin samples and HDFs were prepared as described before
[27].

Western blotting for Cav-1 and COL I
Western blotting was performed as described
previously [28]. The protein bands were probed with the
antibodies (human and mouse) to anti-Cav-1 (ab28947,
1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), COL1A2 (Y-18,
1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and
anti-β-actin (ab-6276, 1:5,000; Abcam) overnight at 4oC.
Densitometric analyses were performed by using the Multi
Gauge V3.0 software (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).

Quantitative measurement of COL I by ELISA
Expression levels of COL I protein were determined by
the commercially available Procollagen type I C-peptide
enzyme immunoassay kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan), and
absorbance was determined at 450 nm with a microplate
reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).

5’-cggaaggccatgccagtgagctt-3’). Annealing temperatures
were 55oC for human COL I; 58 oC for mouse Cav1,
mouse Col I and mouse β-actin; and 60 oC for human
CAV1 and human GAPDH. Expression levels were
normalized to an endogenous β-actin or GAPDH levels.
For experiments to measure mRNA levels, RT-PCR/realtime PCRs were performed with the same primer sets
for target genes. Real-time PCR was done in triplicate
with the HOT FIREPol EvaGreen® qPCR Mix Plus
(Solis BioDyne, Tartu, Estonia) using a RotorGene 3000
(Corbett Research, Cambridge, U.K.). The thermal cycling
condition was 15 min at 95oC, followed by 40 cycles of
95oC for 10 sec, 55-60oC for 20 sec, and 72oC for 30 sec.
The relative abundance of a given transcript was estimated
using the 2−ΔΔCt method, following normalization to β-actin
or GAPDH.

Measurement of skin thickness
Skin thickness was measured with a dial thickness
gauge (Peacock, Scotts Valley, CA). After hairless mouse
was killed by neck dissection, skin flap containing the
epidermis and dermis was immediately obtained by
dissecting skin layer from the underlying muscle with
iris scissors. Then, the skin flap was inserted between
the contact points of dial thickness gauge. For accurate
measurement, we prepared relatively large-sized skin flap,
measuring at least 3 cm in diameter.

Statistics
Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). Statistical analyses were performed by independent
t-test or by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
post hoc Tukey’s test using SPSS v13.0 (SPSS, Chicago,
IL), when multiple comparisons were made. P < 0.05
was considered indicative of a statistically significant
difference.
