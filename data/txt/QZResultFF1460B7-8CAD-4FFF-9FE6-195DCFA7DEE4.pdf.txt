Correction: Resveratrol Inhibits DrugInduced Apoptosis in Human Leukemia
Cells by Creating an Intracellular Milieu
Nonpermissive for Death Execution
In this article (Cancer Res 2004;64:1452–9), which was published in the February 15,
2004, issue of Cancer Research (1), the authors did not cite a previously published
poster presented at a symposium on "Apoptosis: From Signaling Pathways to
Therapeutic Tools," held in Luxembourg in January 2003 and published as conference proceedings (2), even though parts of the text were similar. Figures 1 and 3 from
the previous article were also reused in the Cancer Research article. To correct the
academic record, reference is now given to that prior publication.
