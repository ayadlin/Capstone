Abstract
Human glypican 3 (GPC3) is preferentially expressed in the
tumor tissues of liver cancer patients. In this study, we
obtained a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the COOHterminal part of GPC3, which induced antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The mAb, designated GC33,
exhibited marked tumor growth inhibition of s.c. transplanted
Hep G2 and HuH-7 xenografts that expressed GPC3 but did not
inhibit growth of the SK-HEP-1 that was negative for GPC3.
GC33 was efficacious even in an orthotopic model; it markedly
reduced the blood A-fetoprotein levels of mice intrahepatically transplanted with Hep G2 cells. Humanized GC33
(hGC33) was as efficacious as GC33 against the Hep G2
xenograft, but hGC33 lacking carbohydrate moieties caused
neither ADCC nor tumor growth inhibition. Depletion of
CD56+ cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
markedly abrogated the ADCC caused by hGC33. The results
show that the antitumor activity of hGC33 is mainly
attributable to ADCC, and in human, natural killer cell–
mediated ADCC is one possible mechanism of the antitumor
effects by GC33. hGC33 will provide a novel treatment option
for liver cancer patients with GPC3-positive tumors. [Cancer

Introduction
Glypican 3 (GPC3) is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan and locates
on the cell surface by a mechanism involving the glycerophosphatidylinositol anchor (1). Loss-of-function mutation of GPC3 was
identified in patients of Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS),
an X-linked disorder characterized by prenatal and postnatal
overgrowth with visceral and skeletal abnormalities, indicative of
the GPC3 gene as the causative gene for SGBS (2). Patients of SGBS
have an increased risk of embryonal tumors, including Wilms’
tumors. Mice carrying the homozygous deletion of the GPC3 gene
exhibited clinical features similar to SGBS, such as developmental
overgrowth, perinatal death, cystic and dysplastic kidneys, and
abnormal lung development (3).
GPC3 protein is expressed in a wide variety of tissues during
development, but its expression in most adult tissues is suppressed,
at least in part, by the methylation of DNA within the promoter

region (4). GPC3 regulates cell growth positively and negatively
depending on the cell type. Overgrowth of SGBS and GPC3 in
knockout mice suggests a negative regulation of cell growth by
GPC3. In fact, ectopic expression of GPC3 inhibited the growth of
mesothelium, breast, ovary, and lung cancer cells (5–8) and
induced apoptosis in a cell line–specific manner (9). Because
GPC3 is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, it may function as a
coreceptor for fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and GPC3 has
been shown to bind to FGF2 (10). In addition, GPC3 is required for
the stimulation of the noncanonical Wnt pathway in some cell
types; GPC3 stimulates the noncanonical Wnt pathway, which in
turn suppresses canonical Wnt signaling in embryos and in
mesothelioma cells (11). Furthermore, on insulin stimulation, GPC3
is physically associated with GLUT4 on the cell surface and
enhances insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (12).
On the other hand, GPC3 is highly expressed in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) cells and tissues (13–18) and stimulates the
growth of HCC cells by increasing autocrine/paracrine canonical
Wnt signaling (19). Overexpression of the GPC3 protein in tumor
tissues has been confirmed by immunohistochemistry in f70% of
HCC patients (17). In addition, GPC3 negatively regulates BMP7, a
negative regulator of cell growth (16). GPC3 is processed by a furinlike convertase and the processing occurs in the cysteine-rich
domain located in the middle of the protein (20). Curiously, neither
heparin sulfate chains nor processing of GPC3 is required for
binding to Wnts, stimulation of Wnt signaling, or growth of HCC
cells in vitro and in vivo (19, 21). Furthermore, requirement of
SULF2 for GPC3-mediated FGF2 signaling was also recently
reported (22).
In this study, we show that a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against
the COOH-terminal region of GPC3 induced antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and elicited antitumor activity in an
antigen-dependent manner. Marked inhibition of tumor growth by
the anti-GPC3 mAb was observed in both ectopic and orthotopic
tumor xenograft models. Experiments using a humanized antiGPC3 mAb suggest that, in human, natural killer (NK) cells serve as
major effectors for ADCC.

Materials and Methods
Cells. Human HCC cell lines SK-HEP-1 and HuH-7 were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and Health Science Research
Resources Bank Japan, respectively. These cells were cultured in DMEM
(Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The human
hepatoblastoma cell line Hep G2 was obtained from ATCC, and the cells
were cultured in Eagle’s MEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS,
nonessential amino acids, and 1.0 mmol/L sodium pyruvate. The cell
surface expression of the human GPC3 was confirmed by flow cytometry
and quantified using a QIFI-Kit (DakoCytomation).

SK-03 xenograft models. A and B, expression of GPC3
in SK-HEP-1 (A) and SK-03 (B) cells. Cell surface

transfection of the human GPC3 cDNA. C and D, antitumor
activity of GC33 against SK-HEP-1 (C ) and SK-03 (D )

cells of SK-HEP-1 or SK-03. When tumors reached an
average volume of 180 mm3, mice were administered
1 mg/kg GC33 (E), 5 mg/kg GC33 (n), or only PBS (o).
GC33 and PBS were administered once a week for 3 wk.
Points, mean of six animals; bars, SD. Tumor volume
(top ) and body weight (bottom ) are indicated. Arrows, the
days on which GC33 was administered.

Antibody and drugs. MRL/lpr mice were immunized with a GPC3
fragment containing the COOH-terminal region (amino acid positions
between 524 and 563). The hybridoma clone that produced the mAb with
the strongest binding to the antigen was selected for further characterization, and the mAb was designated GC33 (IgG2a, n). Details of the generation
of GC33 will be described in a separate article.6 The murine antibody was
collected from the culture medium of the hybridoma, and the humanized
antibody was produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The
antibodies were purified by protein A affinity column chromatography
(20) and diluted with PBS before use. Doxorubicin and mitoxantrone were
obtained from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
Ltd., respectively, and were diluted with PBS before administration.
Sorafenib was synthesized by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and was
diluted with 10% ethanol and 10% Cremophor EL in water before
administration.
Transfection of DNA. The entire region of the human GPC3 cDNA (15)
was cloned at the EcoRI sites of the pCXND2 expression vector, which is a
derivative of pCXN (23) containing a CAG promoter and neomycin-resistant
gene. The resulting plasmid, pCXND2, in which the human GPC3 cDNA was
linked to the CAG promoter, was designated pCXND2/hGPC3(FL). To
generate a cell line that stably overexpressed the human GPC3, SK-HEP-1
cells were transfected with pCXND2/hGPC3(FL) using FuGENE 6 (Roche
Diagnostics Corp.) and selected with 1 mg/mL Geneticin (Invitrogen). Cells
that grew even in the presence of G418 were collected, and the colonies
were isolated by limiting dilution. One of the clones, SK-03, which expressed
f2.1  106 molecules per cell of the human GPC3, was selected and used
for the experiments.

Animals and drug administration. Six-week-old male CB-17 severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were purchased from CLEA Japan,
Inc. Just before tumor transplantation, the mice were i.p. injected with
200 Ag of anti-asialo GM1 antibody (Wako). The mice were then s.c.
inoculated with 5  106 cells of SK-03, SK-HEP-1, Hep G2, or HuH-7
suspended in 50% Matrigel (Becton Dickinson). When the tumor volume
reached approximately 170 to 400 mm3, the mice were i.v. administered the
indicated doses of the anti-GPC3 antibody (GC33) once a week for 3 wk. The
control mice received the same volume (10 mL/kg) of PBS. Day 0 represents
the day of the first administration. For combination therapy with sorafenib,
sorafenib was orally administrated 5 d a week for 3 wk. For combination
therapy with doxorubicin and mitoxantrone, drugs were administered i.v.
once a week for 3 wk starting day 0. Control mice were administrated with
the vehicle, which was PBS( ) for GC33 and 10% ethanol and 10%
Cremophor EL in water for sorafenib. Tumor volume was estimated using
the equation V = ab 2/2, where a and b are tumor length and width,
respectively.
An orthotopic tumor model was created by intrahepatically injecting
5  106 Hep G2 cells into 5-wk-old male BALB/c nu/nu (Charles River Japan,
Inc.). Twenty-one days after tumor transplantation, mice whose serum
a-fetoprotein (AFP) levels had reached between 10 and 100 ng/mL were i.v.
administered 5 mg/kg anti-GPC3 antibody (GC33) or vehicle (PBS) 21 and
28 d after tumor transplantation.
Determination of the serum levels of AFP. AFP concentrations in sera
were determined by ELISA using an Enzyme Immunoassay kit (Hope
Laboratories, Inc.). Whole blood samples were collected from mice 21 and
35 d after tumor transplantation, and the concentration of AFP in the sera
was determined according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Preparation of mouse and human effector cells. Mouse bone marrow
cells (BMC) were obtained from the femurs of 6-wk-old male CB-17 SCID
mice. After washing twice, the BMCs were cultured in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen),
50 ng/mL of recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2; PeproTech, Inc.),

and 10 ng/mL of recombinant mouse granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF; PeproTech) for 5 d at 37jC and used as effector
cells. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were purified
from whole blood samples of healthy volunteers by density gradient
centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) and were resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mmol/L EDTA.
CD14+ and CD56+ cells were depleted by MACS using CD14 and CD56
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec), respectively. The resulting PBMCs depleted of
CD14+ or CD56+ were washed with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and used
as human effector cells.
Determination of ADCC. 51Cr-labeled Hep G2 cells were plated onto a
96-well plate and incubated with serial dilutions of antibodies in the
presence of effector cells at an E:T ratio of 50:1. After incubation at 37jC for
4 h, the supernatants were collected, and radioactivities in the supernatants
were counted with a gamma counter. Specific cell cytotoxicity was
calculated according to the following formula: cell cytotoxicity (%) =
(A
C)/(B
C), in which A, B, and C represent the radioactivity of the
target cells in the supernatant incubated with antibody and effector cells,
lysed with 1% NP40, and cultured without antibody or effector cells,
respectively.
Preparation of the humanized GC33. The humanized GC33 (hGC33)
was generated by complementarity-determining region grafting as described (24). Details of the generation of the humanization of GC33 will be
reported in a separate article. The cDNA for the heavy chain variable region
(VH) of the hGC33 was cloned at the EcoRI-NheI sites in pBluescript KS (+)
(Toyobo) carrying the constant region of human IgG1. The cDNA for the
light chain variable region (VL) of the hGC33 was cloned at the XhoI-BsiWI
sites in pBluescript KS (+) harboring the constant region of the human n
chain. cDNAs for the hGC33 were cloned in pCXND, and the resulting

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

plasmid DNA was transfected into CHO cells by electroporation. Transformants were selected by G418 and mAbs were purified by protein
G-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purified antibodies were dialyzed
against and diluted with PBS before use. cDNA for the aglycosylated form of
the hGC33 was generated by alanine substitution for asparagine at 297
within the Fc region that serves as the glycosylation by site-directed
mutagenesis (25).

Results
Antitumor activity of the anti-GPC3 mAb. Mouse and human
GPC3 protein are highly homologous (94% sequence identity) and
human GPC3 might not be quite antigenic in mice. Therefore, we
used MRL/lpr mice, which develop an autoimmune syndrome for
immunization. Immunization of the MRL/lpr mice with the COOHterminal region of GPC3 yielded a mAb that bound to CHO cells
expressing the human GPC3.6 This mAb, designated GC33, also
induced ADCC in GPC3-expressing CHO cells but not in the
parental CHO cells.6 This prompted us to examine the antitumor
activity of GC33 in human hepatoma xenograft models. GC33 was
not efficacious against the SK-HEP-1 that did not express GPC3
even at 5 mg/kg (Fig. 1). Transfection of the human GPC3 cDNA
into SK-HEP-1 cells resulted in the expression of the GPC3 protein
as revealed by flow cytometry, and the clone designated SK-03, in
which the amount of cell surface GPC3 protein was estimated to be
f2.1  106 molecules per cell, was used for testing the antitumor
activity of GC33. Administration of 1 mg/kg GC33 markedly

Figure 3. Efficacy of GC33 in an orthotopic Hep G2 xenograft model. Nude
mice were intrahepatically inoculated 5  106 cells of Hep G2. Twenty-one days
after the tumor inoculation, the serum AFP concentrations reached between
10 to 100 ng/mL and mice were divided into two groups: an anti-GC33 antibody
group in which mice were administered 5 mg/kg GC33 and a vehicle group in
which mice were administrated PBS (Vehicle ). Each group consisted of five
animals. PBS and GC33 were administered 21 and 28 d after the tumor
inoculation. The serum AFP levels of each animal 21 and 35 d after tumor
inoculation are shown. Horizontal bars, mean AFP level in each group.

inhibited the growth of the SK-03 xenograft, and the antitumor
effect from GC33 became more profound at higher doses; GC33 at
5 mg/kg caused tumor remission (Fig. 1).
Next, we examined whether GC33 caused tumor growth
inhibition in xenografts that expressed endogenous GPC3. Hep
G2 and HuH-7 were selected because of the amount of GPC3
expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 2). The estimated amount of cell
surface GPC3 protein was 1.5  106 molecules per cell in Hep G2
and 4.0  104 molecules per cell in HuH-7 cells (Fig. 2A and B).
GC33 was efficacious against both Hep G2 and HuH-7 xenografts;
at 5 mg/kg, GC33 strongly inhibited the growth of the HuH-7
xenograft and caused tumor remission in the Hep G2 xenograft
model (Fig. 2). The antitumor effect of GC33 also attenuated body
weight loss caused by the Hep G2 xenograft. In mice carrying the

Hep G2 xenograft, body weight decreased as the tumor grew (after
day 35), whereas it remained constant (f25 g) when mice were
administered 5 mg/kg GC33 (Fig. 2D). The degree of tumor growth
inhibition from GC33 seems to correlate with the level of cell
surface antigens because the amount of cell surface GPC3 protein
was highest in SK-03 and lowest in HuH-7 cells among SK-03, Hep
G2, and HuH-7 (Figs. 1 and 2). We also confirmed that control
human IgG had no significant effect on the growth of the tumor
xenografts.
The above results clearly show the antitumor activity of GC33 in
human hepatoma xenograft models, in which tumors were
transplanted s.c. Accordingly, we asked whether GC33 elicits
antitumor activity even when tumors have been transplanted
orthotopically. After intrahepatic injection of Hep G2, serum AFP
levels reached between 10 and 100 ng/mL 21 days after tumor
transplantation (Fig. 3). Administration of GC33 caused marked
decrease of serum AFP; serum AFP levels were <1 ng/mL in mice
administered 5 mg/kg GC33, whereas the level of serum AFP
continued to increase in mice that received only vehicle (PBS;
Fig. 3). On day 35, there were no visible tumors in mice
administered GC33, but multiple tumors were observed in
vehicle-treated mice. All these results show that GC33 is efficacious
even against the Hep G2 xenograft growing in the liver.
Antitumor activity in combination with the anti-GPC3 mAb
and chemotherapeutic agents. Although not quite efficacious,
chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, cisplatinum, and 5-fluorouracil have been used for the treatment of
liver cancers. Recently, sorafenib, which preferably inhibits the
tyrosine kinase activities of c-Raf, vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, VEGFR-3, and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor-h, was shown to prolong the survival of HCC
patients (26). Therefore, we examined the antitumor activity of
GC33 in combination with sorafenib. When administrated as single
agents, GC33 at 1 mg/kg and sorafenib at the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) of 80 mg/kg inhibited the growth of Hep G2
xenografts, and tumor growth inhibition became more profound
when mice received both GC33 and sorafenib (Fig. 4). Tumor

Mode of action of the anti-GPC3 mAb. Because GC33 induced
ADCC in GPC3-positive hepatoma cells, tumor growth inhibition
by GC33 might be attributable to ADCC. To confirm this possibility,
we generated an aglycosylated mutant that lacked carbohydrates,
thereby losing the ability to induce ADCC. In addition, a
humanized antibody is appropriate for clinical application because
of reduced antigenicity in human. Therefore, we generated hGC33
and then substituted alanine for asparagine at 297, which serves as
the carbohydrate attachment site within the human IgG Fc region
(25). Although the ADCC of hGC33 with mouse effector cells was
somewhat weaker than that of GC33 at antibody concentrations
higher than 0.1 mg/mL (Fig. 5A), hGC33 was highly efficacious
against the Hep G2 xenograft and caused tumor remission at
the dose of 5 mg/kg (Fig. 5B and C). An aglycosylated mutant of
hGC33 had the same antigen-binding activity as GC33 did (K d =
0.67 nmol/L) but failed to induce ADCC in the presence of mouse
effector cells (Fig. 5A). The antitumor activity of the aglycosylated
mutant of hGC33 was nearly completely diminished (Fig. 5B and
C), showing that the antitumor activity of hGC33 is largely
attributable to ADCC.
Next, we asked which effector cells are important for the ADCC
activity of hGC33 in human. The human PBMCs used in this study
contained 15.9% CD14+ cells and 16.3% CD56+ cells, and 99.3% of
the CD56+ cells and 99.9% of the CD14+ cells were eliminated by
MACS using anti-CD56 mAb beads and anti-CD14 mAb beads,
respectively (data not shown). hGC33 strongly induced ADCC
against Hep G2 cells in the presence of human PBMCs (Fig. 6).
Depletion of CD56+ cells from human PBMC markedly diminished
the ADCC from hGC33 but depletion of CD14+ cells only slightly
attenuated the activity (Fig. 6). Because a large majority of CD56+
cells and CD14+ cells were NK cells and monocytes, respectively,
NK cells may play an important role as effector cells for the ADCC
of hGC33 in human.

Discussion

Hep G2 cells that had been labeled with 51Cr and mouse BMCs that had been

administered once a week for 3 wk. Tumor volume (B) and tumor weight 68 d

growth inhibition by the combination of 1 mg/kg GC33 and
80 mg/kg sorafenib was stronger than that attained by the same
doses of each drug (Fig. 4A). In addition, GC33 significantly
reduced the body weight loss caused by sorafenib (Fig. 4A). An
additive effect on antitumor activity was also observed by the
combination of GC33 with the MTD of doxorubicin (1 mg/kg) in
the doxorubicin-sensitive HuH-7 xenograft model (Fig. 4B) and
with the MTD of mitoxantrone (1 mg/kg) in the mitoxantronesensitive Hep G2 xenograft model (data not shown). These results
support the possibility that GC33 can be safely combined with
chemotherapeutic agents to elicit additive effects.

GC33 is dependent on the antigen expression on the cell surface;
GC33 strongly inhibited the growth of GPC3-positive tumors but
did not affect the growth of GPC3-negative tumors. Furthermore,
the degree of tumor growth inhibition by GC33 roughly correlated
with the levels of cell surface antigens, suggesting that clinical
efficacy may also correlate with the antigen expression levels
within the tumor tissue. GC33 also restored body weight in mice
bearing the Hep G2 xenograft. The reason for body weight loss by
Hep G2 is not clear but Hep G2 might secrete cytokines that cause
cachectic symptoms. It is possible that GC33 inhibits cytokine
secretion from Hep G2. Although the sequences of GPC3 proteins
are highly conserved among species, GC33 showed a similar
binding activity to monkey GPC3 but did not react with mouse
GPC3. Therefore, we administered GC33 to cynomolgus monkeys
to assess the safety profile. Even after repeated administrations at a
dose higher than 100 mg/kg, there were no abnormal clinical or
pathologic signs in all the major tissues tested, including heart,
lung, liver, and kidney. Nevertheless, adverse events should be
carefully evaluated in clinical studies. Further details of the toxicity
profile of GC33 will be published separately.
Although the ADCC from hGC33 in the presence of mouse
effector cells was weaker than that from GC33, hGC33 was as
efficacious as GC33 in Hep G2 xenograft models. Substitution of an
alanine for asparagine at 297 almost completely diminished the
ability to induce ADCC, presumably due to a lack of carbohydrate
moieties. Consequently, the aglycosylated mutant of the hGC33 did
not show antitumor activity in vivo. Furthermore, depletion of
CD56+ NK cell–rich cell fractions from human PBMC markedly
decreased ADCC. On the other hand, the chimera GC33 carrying
the Fc region derived from the human IgG1n induced complementdependent cellular toxicity (CDC) in CHO cells expressing the
human GPC3 but not in Hep G2 and HuH-7 in the presence of
human serum.6 Although the reason why the chimera GC33 could
not induce CDC against Hep G2 and HuH-7 remains unclear, these
results suggest that the antitumor activity of hGC33 is largely
attributable to ADCC and that NK cell–mediated ADCC is one
possible mechanism of the antitumor effects in human. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that Fc-mediated
mechanisms other than ADCC are also involved in the antitumor
activity of hGC33.
GPC3 expression is up-regulated in the majority of the HCC,
colorectal carcinomas, and embryonal tumors, such as neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and Wilms’ tumors. On the other hand, it
is suppressed in other types of tumors and cells, such as breast
cancer cells, ovarian cancer cells, and malignant mesothelioma

cells, presumably due to the hypermethylation of DNA in its
promoter region (5–7, 27). In addition, overexpression of GPC3 in
certain cell types, such as human breast and ovarian cancer cell
lines, causes apoptosis (5, 6, 9). Thus, GPC3 may positively and
negatively modulate cell proliferation in a cell type–dependent
manner. De Cat and colleagues (20) reported that GPC3 underwent
endoproteolytic cleavage within the cysteine-rich domain, and this
processing was essential for the apoptosis caused by the GPC3
overexpression. On the other hand, although SK-03 cells, a SK-HEP1 derivative line transfected with human GPC3 cDNA, expressed a
certain amount of GPC3 as determined by flow cytometry, their
growth was not significantly different from that of the parent
SK-HEP-1 cells. Because the NH2-terminal region of GPC3 was
detected under reduced conditions both in the culture supernatants of these cells and in the blood of the mice transplanted
with these tumors (14, 28),7 GPC3 protein seems to be processed
also in SK-03, HuH-7, and Hep G2 cells. Further studies are
necessary to understand the growth regulation of these cells from
GPC3.
Recently, GPC3 was shown to be involved in atypical multidrug
resistance in gastric cancer cells. Although the overexpression of
GPC3 alone was not sufficient to confer resistance to mitoxantrone,
gastric cells that became resistant to mitoxantrone expressed an
increased level of GPC3, and suppression of GPC3 expression by an
anti-GPC3 ribozyme not only restored sensitivity to mitoxantrone
but also attenuated cross-resistance to etoposide (29). Furthermore, the degree of drug resistance correlated with the level of
GPC3 mRNA. Although the molecular mechanism of atypical
multidrug resistance by GPC3 remains unclear, the above facts
raise the possibility that impairment of the GPC3 function by an
anti-GPC3 antibody may also increase the susceptibility of liver
cancers to chemotherapeutic agents. Additive antitumor effects
from the combination of the anti-GPC3 antibody with doxorubicin,
mitoxantrone, and sorafenib may also be a consequence of an
increase in the susceptibility of cells to these drugs from the antiGPC3 antibody.
