Abstract
Ionizing radiation (IR) is an effective anticancer treatment, although failures still occur. To improve radiotherapy, tumor-targeted strategies are needed to increase radiosensitivity of tumor cells, without influencing
normal tissue radiosensitivity. Base excision repair (BER) and single-strand break repair (SSBR) contribute to
the determination of sensitivity to IR. A crucial protein in BER/SSBR is DNA polymerase β (polβ). Aberrant
polβ expression is commonly found in human tumors and leads to inhibition of BER. Here, we show that
truncated polβ variant (polβ-Δ)–expressing cells depend on homologous recombination (HR) for survival after IR, indicating that a considerable fraction of polβ-Δ–induced lesions are subject to repair by HR. Increased
sensitization was found not to result from involvement in DNA-dependent protein kinase–dependent nonhomologous end joining, the other major double-strand break repair pathway. Caffeine and the ATM inhibitor
Ku55933 cause polβ-Δ–dependent radiosensitization. Consistent with the observed HR dependence and the
known HR-modulating activity of ATM, polβ-Δ–expressing cells showed increased radiosensitization after
BRCA2 knockdown that is absent under ATM-inhibited conditions. Our data suggest that treatment with
HR modulators is a promising therapeutic strategy for exploiting defects in the BER/SSBR pathway in human
tumors. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8706–14. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
One of the primary treatments for many types of cancer is
ionizing radiation (IR), either as a single modality or in combination with other therapies. Local tumor control, however,
is strongly determined by intrinsic tumor radioresistance and
normal tissue radiosensitivity, which can both limit success.
To improve radiotherapy, tumor-targeted strategies are
needed that exploit tumor-specific characteristics and consequently spare normal tissue. Here, we present a novel tumordirected radiosensitization strategy, exploiting DNA repair
deficiencies commonly found in tumors.
Base excision repair (BER) is the major repair system responsible for removing and repairing the majority of lesions
caused by IR, namely single-strand breaks (SSB) and base damages. Repair is initiated by DNA glycosylases that excise the
damaged base, followed by AP-endonuclease (APE1) generating SSB intermediates (1, 2). Direct radiation-induced SSBs
require some end processing by enzymes such as PNK and

APE1 (3, 4). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is recruited to SSB sites and is thought to facilitate recruitment
of repair proteins. Further repair occurs through either
short-patch repair or long-patch repair (LP-BER), resulting
in different numbers of incorporated nucleotides. DNA polymerase β (polβ) is one of the key players in BER and SSB
repair (SSBR), although the replicative polymerases polδ/ε
are also implicated in LP-BER (5). Ligase complexes complete
the repair.
Polβ deficiency leads to diminished BER efficiency and
causes cells to become hypersensitive to killing by alkylating
agents (6). We previously showed a role for polβ in repair of
radiation-induced DNA damage in both G0 and G1 cells, underlining the importance of polβ in BER after IR (7, 8). These
data also implied that there are strong backup repair processes in S-phase cells that promote survival after IR in cells
lacking polβ.
Polβ has been found to be altered in a considerable number of human tumors (reviewed in ref. 9) of which most
alterations were derived from single mutations and truncations. Aberrant expression was frequently confined to the
polymerase domain, resulting in either error-prone synthesis
or abolition of polymerase activity. Expression of several proteins, such as aberrant polβ, has been shown to inhibit BER
and can result in cellular transformation (10, 11). Interestingly, aberrant polβ can act in a dominant-negative manner
over concomitantly expressed wild-type (WT) polβ (12, 13).
Interference in BER of radiation-induced DNA damage
was shown by expression of such an aberrant polβ variant
containing the DNA-binding properties but lacking the

Radiosensitization of polβ Variant–Expressing Cells

polymerase domain (14–16). In cells expressing this truncated protein (polβ-Δ), we observed increased induction of
chromosome and chromatid-type aberrations after IR, indicating formation of secondary DSBs (17). Our data indicated
that these arose partly during repair of IR-specific clustered
damage and partly during replication. Unrepaired BER intermediates can cause the replication fork to stall and to form
a DSB. These replication-associated DSBs are thought to
depend mainly on repair by homologous recombination
(HR; refs. 18, 19).
We therefore hypothesized that replication-associated
DBS formed after radiation, resulting from interference by
polβ-Δ, will be repaired by HR. Because most would be repaired successfully, these would have little influence on cell
killing. However, if cells are deficient in HR, this will result in
unrepaired DSBs, leading to increased cell killing. Here, we
show that cells expressing polβ-Δ indeed depend on HR
for survival after IR. Because a significant fraction of human
tumors express such aberrant polβ proteins, this could be
therapeutically exploited by targeting HR. We show here
the feasibility of such a tumor-targeted strategy.

were plated and irradiated 14 to 15 hours later. When inhibitors were used, they were added 1 hour before irradiation,
and the medium was replaced by a fresh medium 23 hours
later. Colonies were fixed and stained, and those consisting
of 50 cells or more were counted. Survival was calculated
relative to the plating efficiency of unirradiated controls. Hamster cell colonies were counted using the ColCount (Oxford
Optronics) colony counter, and A549 cells were counted by
eye under an inverted dissecting microscope. Each experiment
was carried out at least three times. Dose enhancement factors
(DEF) values were calculated as the ratio of doses to produce
37% survival (DEF37). Average DEF37 for drug-induced sensitization were calculated from second-order polynomial curve
fits through the dose-response data (log survival versus radiation dose) of the individual experiments. Errors on DEF37 are
SD. For the analysis of the genetically modified cells, means of
the 37% survival values and SD from three or more separate
experiments were calculated for each cell line and condition.
To derive errors on the DEF, errors on the DEF37 values for the
two groups being compared were combined using the root
mean squares of the fractional errors. Sensitization factors
at a given inhibitor concentration were calculated as the ratio
of surviving fractions at 2 Gy versus 0 Gy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, cell culture, and transfection
Human lung carcinoma cells (A549) were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection and transduced with a
truncated variant of polβ-containing LZRS-MS-EGFP expression vector (polβ-Δ) or empty vector control (LZRS; ref. 20).
Cells were grown in DMEM. Chinese hamster cells V79B
(WT), CLV4B (deficient in RAD51C), and CLV4B+ (complemented with full-length human RAD51 cDNA) were previously described (21, 22) and kindly provided by M.Z. Zdzienicka
and B.C. Godthelp (Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden,
the Netherlands) and grown in HAM-F10 medium. All cell
lines were used within 20 passages before returning to the
original frozen stock. Karyotype, radiosensitivity, and gene
expression were regularly tested and remained constant in
all cell lines. All cells were grown under standard conditions
at 37°C with 5% CO2 in medium supplemented with 10% FCS
and antibiotics and tested regularly for Mycoplasma. All
hamster cell lines were transfected with polβ-Δ and LZRS
by using FuGene6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. Cells were harvested 48 hours after transfection
and placed under puromycin selection. Cells were sorted
on green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression by FACScan
flow cytometry (FACScan, BD).
Gamma- and UV-C irradiation
Gamma irradiation experiments were performed using a
137
Cs irradiation unit with a dose rate of 0.66 Gy/min, and
UV-C irradiation was performed using a Stratagene UV-C
X-linker (254 nm).
Clonogenic survival assays
Cell survival was assessed by colony formation. All hamster
cells were irradiated 6 hours after plating. Human A549 cells

Drugs
Drugs used were the DNA-dependent protein kinase
(DNA-PK) inhibitor NU7026 and the ATM-kinase inhibitor
Ku55933, both purchased from Calbiochem (an affiliate of
Merck KGaA). In knockdown experiments, an ATM inhibitor
purchased from Tocris Biosciences was used. ATM and DNAPK inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO. Controls without
inhibitors were treated with the respective solvent concentrations. Caffeine (Sigma-Aldrich) was freshly dissolved in
double-distilled water before use.
Immunohistochemistry for RAD51 foci
For RAD51 foci scoring, experiments were performed as
described in ref. (23) by using a rabbit anti-Rad51 (polyclonal,
H-92; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and FITC-conjugated antirabbit antibody (Sigma). Cells were counterstained with 4′,6diamidino-2-phenylindole for 10 minutes before coverslips
were mounted. RAD51 foci were counted blind by using a
Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 100M) equipped
with a CCD camera (MAC 200A, Photometrics). One hundred
cells were counted per point and dose. Each experiment was
repeated three times.
siRNA transfection and quantitative real-time-PCR
A549-LZRS and polβ-Δ cells were transfected with 25
nmol/L Hs_BRCA_7 or AllStars Negative Control siRNA from
Qiagen using Hiperfect (Qiagen) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocols. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, cells were plated for colony assays. Cell samples
of each experiment were harvested to assess knockdown efficiency by real-time-PCR (RT-PCR) after cDNA synthesis
(with SuperScriptII Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen) on
RNA prepared with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to
standard protocols. RT-PCR analysis was performed with

SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and the
QuantiTect primers Hs_BRCA2_1_SG and Hs_B2M_1_SG
(Qiagen) using the Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast-Real-Time
system equipment. Only data from experiments with a knockdown efficiency above 75% were included.
Statistics
The Student's t test was used to test for significant differences between the average DEF induced by small-molecule
inhibitors. A P value of <0.05 was used throughout as the
level of significance.

Results
Polβ-Δ expression leads to a transient increase in
γH2AX foci and SCEs after IR
We have previously shown that expression of the dominantnegative polβ-Δ protein interferes with BER after IR and
results in increased formation of residual double-strand
breaks (DSB) as indicated by an increase in chromosome
and chromatid aberrations (17). Here, we analyzed γH2AX foci
induction at earlier time points after radiation. We treated
cells with 2 Gy of irradiation and observed elevated levels of
γH2AX foci at 6 and 10 hours in A549–polβ-Δ–expressing
compared with vector controls (Supplementary Fig. S1).
γH2AX foci numbers in the polβ-Δ–expressing cells
reached control levels at later time points, indicating
removal by repair.
We therefore analyzed sister chromatid exchanges (SCE),
which represent “successful” repair events. A549–polβ-Δ or
A549-LZRS was irradiated, and metaphases were collected
8 hours later (including 2 hours colcemid). Metaphases therefore represented cells irradiated in the S phase. Spontaneous
SCE induction was not significantly different in the two cell
lines. However, we observed increased amounts of SCE after
2 Gy in polβ-Δ–expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S2),
which we concluded to result from additional but repaired
DNA lesions in polβ-Δ–expressing cells. Because we hypothesized that those lesions could have resulted from replication
attempts at polβ-Δ–induced BER intermediates, we also
expected these lesions to arise after treatment with DNAdamaging agents creating damage similar to IR (oxidative
base damage, SSB) and requiring BER activity; one such agent
is H 2 O 2 . A549–polβ-Δ cells showed an increase in SCE
induction compared with control cells after H2O2 treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S2), which was significant at a dose of
200 μmol/L H 2 O 2 . This indicates increased formation of
DNA lesions after treatment with H2O2 as well as after IR.
Radiosensitization does not result from polβ-Δ
interference in DNA-PK–driven processes
Polβ-Δ interference in BER has been previously documented (14, 15). Nevertheless, the observed increase in DSBs after
IR could also be caused by interference of polβ-Δ in the DSB
repair process itself. To test for a possible polβ-Δ involvement in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), one of the
major DSB repair pathways, we used Chinese hamster ovary
cells either WT or deficient in DNA-PK. These cells were

8708

Cancer Res; 70(21) November 1, 2010

transiently transfected with the human polβ-Δ protein or
the empty vector LZRS. Western blot analyses showed that
polβ-Δ expression was similar in the two lines (Supplementary Fig. S3). DNA-PK–deficient cells, due to their deficiency
in DSB repair, are significantly more radiosensitive than their
parental control cells. Expressing polβ-Δ in both DNA-PK–
deficient as well as DNA-PK–proficient cell lines, however,
resulted in equal increases in radiosensitivity with average
DEFs at 37% survival (DEF 37 ) of 1.18 (±0.21) and 1.16
(±0.11), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4A). This indicates
that polβ-Δ–induced radiosensitization was independent of
DNA-PK expression. We further confirmed this by using human glioma cell lines deficient and complemented with
DNA-PK (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Here, we also observed
similar increases in radiosensitivity after expression of
polβ-Δ and independent of NHEJ capacity, with DEF37 values
of 1.05 for the DNA-PK–deficient and 1.11 for the DNA-PK–
complemented cells, respectively.
Polβ-Δ–induced radiosensitization in these cell lines was
small; thus, to support these findings, we also chemically inhibited NHEJ by using the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026. This
inhibitor was previously shown to effectively inhibit NHEJ
and sensitize cells to IR (24, 25). As previously shown (17,
20), A549–polβ-Δ was more radiosensitive compared with
A549-LZRS. Incubation with NU7026 for 24 hours did not
result in significant toxicity: Exposure to 5 μmol/L NU7026
resulted in an average of 83% and 91% survival compared
with untreated A549-LZRS and A549–polβ-Δ cells, respectively. The radiation dose-response curves in Fig. 1 of
A549–polβ-Δ or A549-LZRS show that inhibition of DNAPK with NU7026 increased radiosensitivity of both cell lines
with a drug-induced DEF37 of 2.23 ± 0.76 and 1.89 ± 0.34 for
LZRS and polβ-Δ–expressing cells, respectively. Taken together, the similar radiosensitization in DNA-PK–proficient

and DNA-PK–deficient cells shows that polβ-Δ–induced
radiosensitization does not result from interference with
DNA-PK–dependent repair processes. In addition, due to
the lack of a greater increase in radiosensitization in the
DNA-PK–inhibited or DNA-PK–deficient cells, these data
also indicate that NHEJ is not used as the main repair
mechanism of potentially lethal lesion induced by polβ-Δ
interference.
Survival of polβ-Δ–expressing cells after radiation is
dependent on HR
HR is the other main pathway used for repairing DSBs after IR. In addition, it provides critical support for replication
by resolving stalled or blocked replication forks. Because
SCEs represent mainly HR events and are dependent on
HR processes (26), increased SCE induction by the expression
of polβ-Δ would indicate participation in such processes. To
exclude involvement of polβ-Δ in HR, we used cells complemented or deficient in Rad51C, a crucial protein for HR.
Expression of polβ-Δ in RAD51C-complemented or WT cells
resulted in a modest increase in radiosensitivity (polβ-Δ–
induced DEF37 of 1.05 ± 0.09 and 1.06 ± 0.15, respectively;
Fig. 2A). In Rad51C-deficient cells, however, expression of
polβ-Δ resulted in a significantly greater radiosensitization
(DEF 37 1.67 ± 0.46). This shows that, first, the polβ-Δ–
induced radiosensitization is not a result of inhibition of
Rad51C-driven HR processes, and second, that survival of
polβ-Δ–expressing cells after irradiation strongly depends
on Rad51C expression. This therefore indicates that polβ-Δ
not only does not affect repair by HR, but that HR is an important backup pathway for repair of potential lethal lesions
that have occurred due to expression of polβ-Δ.
Because radiosensitization by polβ-Δ was increased in
HR-deficient cells, we hypothesized that inhibiting HR processes in polβ-Δ–expressing cells would lead to increased
cell killing after IR. To test this hypothesis, we investigated
the magnitude of radiosensitization caused by caffeine.
Caffeine-induced radiosensitization has previously been
shown to depend on HR status because caffeine failed to
induce radiosensitization in HR-deficient cells (27, 28) and
inhibited HR on SceI-induced DSBs. A549–polβ-Δ or A549LZRS was treated with 2.5 mmol/L caffeine. Inhibition of
HR by caffeine resulted in increased radiosensitivity of both
cell lines but had a greater radiosensitizing effect on polβ-Δ–
expressing cells (drug-induced DEF37 of 1.56 ± 0.35 and 1.81 ±
0.34, respectively; Fig. 2B). This increased radiosensitivity was
not a result of increased killing by caffeine alone in the polβΔ–expressing cells, which had a survival of 81% compared
with 40% in the controls. In contrast to IR, UV-induced
DNA lesions are not repaired by BER. UV-C irradiation to
3 J/m2 resulted in a similar surviving fraction of A549 cells
as after 2 Gy. Moreover, as described previously, both cell
lines were equally sensitive to UV-C radiation (20). Adding
caffeine increased the UV sensitivity of both cell lines similarly
(Fig. 2C), thereby excluding any BER-independent changes.
These studies with caffeine further support a role for HR as
an important backup pathway for survival after IR in cells
expressing polβ-Δ.

with A549-LZRS 1 hour after irradiation (Fig. 3). Increased
formation of RAD51 foci in cells expressing polβ-Δ was also
confirmed in hamster AA8 cells expressing polβ-Δ (Supplementary Fig. S5). Together with the increased dependence on
HR, we interpret this increase in RAD51 foci to represent
increased HR events and use in polβ-Δ–expressing cells. This
supports the hypothesis of increased HR incidence due to increased BER intermediate levels and underlines the importance of HR in polβ-Δ–expressing cells after IR.

polβ-Δ–expressing cells show increased RAD51 foci
formation after IR
Based on the results described above, we predicted an
increase in HR events in polβ-Δ cells compared with their
controls after IR. Nuclear foci containing RAD51 are thought
to represent sites of HR and thereby can be used to indicate
HR events in the cell. As anticipated, A549–polβ-Δ cells
showed significantly increased levels of RAD51 foci compared

Chemical inhibition of HR leads to polβ-Δ–specific
radiosensitization
The polβ-Δ variant used in these studies and other tumorspecific polβ variants have been found to inhibit BER. Our
findings could therefore have potential clinical relevance
and indicate that BER-deficient tumors could specifically
be targeted by inhibiting their backup repair pathways,
which we hypothesized to be HR. However, no specific HR
inhibitor has been reported to date. Bryant and Helleday
(29) reported that ATM inhibition prevented PARP inhibitor
induced HR as determined by hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase recombination frequencies. We
therefore tested the ATM kinase inhibitor Ku55933 for radiosensitization potential in the polβ-Δ–expressing cells. Exposure to Ku55933 resulted in a small reduction of the plating
efficiencies of A549-LZRS and A549–polβ-Δ by 27% and 9%,
respectively. Incubation with Ku55933 for 24 hours combined
with radiation resulted in decreased survival of A549-LZRS
cells (DEF 1.69 ± 0.13; Fig. 4A). However, the radiosensitizing
effect of this ATM inhibitor was significantly greater on
polβ-Δ–expressing cells (DEF37 2.29 ± 0.38).

Radiosensitization of polβ Variant–Expressing Cells

We next questioned if ATM inhibition resulted in the inhibition of HR-dependent processes crucial to the survival of
the polβ-Δ–expressing cells. We transfected the cells with
siRNA to BRCA2 and exposed the cells to 3 Gy with and without the ATM inhibitor Ku55933. Knockdown efficiencies
were comparable in both cell lines, polβ-Δ and LZRS controls, with 84 ± 10% and 82 ± 6%, respectively. Consistent
with the previous observation in Rad51C-deficient cells, reduction in HR resulted in increased radiosensitization in
the A549 polβ-Δ cells compared with their controls (factor
of 2.2 versus 1.3 in the LZRS; Fig. 4B). However, this increase
in the polβ-Δ was absent under ATM-inhibited conditions,
showing that ATM influences polβ-Δ–driven and BRCA2dependent radiosensitization. The lack of BRCA2-dependent
radiosensitization is consistent with the idea that HR modulation resulting from ATM inhibition causes increased radiosensitization in polβ-Δ–expressing cells.
Drug dose–dependent sensitization of
polβ-Δ–expressing cells
We next investigated the optimum inhibitor concentration
at a clinically relevant radiation dose of 2 Gy. Irradiated cells
incubated for 24 hours with varying concentrations of caffeine or the ATM inhibitor showed an increased radiosensitization in A549–polβ-Δ compared with vector controls,
starting at concentrations above 1 mmol/L for caffeine
(Fig. 5A) and above 1 μmol/L for the ATM inhibitor (Fig. 5B).
In particular, the ATM inhibitor greatly increased the sensitization factor for A549–polβ-Δ compared with control cells
(by 1.6- to 2.0-fold at 2.5–10 μmol/L).
Surprisingly, radiosensitization of polβ-Δ–expressing cells
was evident at lower drug concentrations compared with the
controls. This is possibly due to the increased number of lesions, thereby increasing vulnerability to inhibition of backup
repair. In terms of clinical applicability, the data show a window of drug dose that increases radiosensitivity in the polβ
variant–expressing cells while leaving WT cells unaffected. As
a control, we also tested the DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026 at
concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μmol/L and observed
that inhibiting DNA-PK at any of the given concentrations
does not result in polβ-Δ–dependent radiosensitization.
The sensitization factor increased with increasing DNA-PK
inhibitor concentration although to similar extent in both
cell lines (Fig. 5C), consistent with the radiation doseresponse data described above.
In summary, two compounds, caffeine and an ATM inhibitor, caused greater radiosensitization in BER-deficient cells,
demonstrating the feasibility of a tumor-targeted radiosensitization strategy.

Discussion
From the results of this study, we propose a new tumortargeted strategy in which inhibitors affecting HR could be
used to increase radiosensitization of tumors displaying
BER deficiencies. The data presented here show that cells
expressing a truncated DNA polymerase β (polβ-Δ) depend
on HR for survival after IR. Moreover, we show that polβ-Δ–

induced radiosensitization is not affected by DNA-PK–driven
NHEJ. The data therefore strongly indicate that HR is used as
the major backup pathway for repair of secondary DSBs or
collapsed replication forks that were induced by expression
of this truncated polβ. As judged from the radiosensitization
in the DSB repair mutant cells, polβ-Δ expression does not
affect DSB repair and therefore cannot be the cause of the
radiosensitization observed in these cells.
To improve radiotherapy, strategies are being developed
that involve the identification of molecular targets responsible for the radioresistance of cancer cells. The archetypal
example to date is targeted radiosensitization through inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/RAS,
phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and related signaling pathways
in EGFR-overexpressing tumors (30, 31). Here, we propose a
strategy that exploits differences in dealing with radiation
damage in tumors compared with normal tissue, thereby realizing tumor-targeted radiosensitization. By targeting the
backup pathway (HR) that is predominantly engaged in
BER-deficient cells after radiation, we achieved increased
radiosensitization. BER-proficient cells, such as those in normal tissues, by contrast, are capable of sufficiently repairing
damage by BER, thereby reducing the formation of secondarily formed and potentially lethal lesions.
This is analogous to the use of inhibitors of PARP, a key
protein in BER/SSBR, which successfully and specifically
targets HR-deficient cells (BRCA1 and BRCA 2; refs. 32, 33).
PARP inhibition is thus a useful therapeutic strategy for
tumors displaying defects in the BRCA genes (34, 35). These
studies underline the potential and impact of tumortargeted strategies that exploit DNA repair deficiencies of
tumor cells. Here, we show the reverse: Inhibitors affecting
HR are more effective sensitizers on cells deficient in BER/
SSBR. This is of potential clinical relevance because ∼30% of
human tumors of different origins have been reported to
contain mutations and/or truncations of polβ (9). Aberrant
expression was found concomitant with WT polβ expression
and often observed in the tumors only. Interestingly, clear
cell renal carcinomas arising in kidney or cell lines did not
exhibit POLB mutations (COSMIC database; ref. 36). In
contrast, POLB somatic mutations in prostate cancer are
hypothesized by the authors to contribute to tumorigenesis
by driving mutagenesis (37). In addition to genomic mutations, altered expression can be a result of aberrant splicing,
commonly observed in tumors (38). Expression of several of
these polβ variants has been shown to lead to decreased
BER efficiency.
This prompted us to test the proposed novel tumortargeted radiosensitization strategy. We hypothesized that
in polβ-Δ–expressing cells, HR inhibitors could be used for
specific sensitization given their dependence on HR for survival. To test this, we first studied the effects of caffeine, which
inhibits both ATM and ATR kinases, thereby inhibiting repair
and abrogating proper DNA damage checkpoint responses after IR (39). From a lack of radiosensitization in HR-deficient
cells, Wang and colleagues showed that caffeine exerts
its radiosensitizing effect through HR (27, 28). Caffeine was also shown to inhibit HR, as measured by an I-SceI–induced

8712

Cancer Res; 70(21) November 1, 2010

GFP-based DSB repair assay (40). Together with changes in
Rad51 foci formation, these data strongly suggest that caffeine inhibits HR-directed repair processes. Our results with
caffeine therefore support the HR dependence of polβ-Δ–
expressing cells.
In addition to caffeine, in an attempt to show feasibility by
chemical inhibition, we also tested drugs that have been
reported to indirectly affect HR. One such drug is an ATM
kinase inhibitor. ATM is the main transducer of response
to DSBs, and its activation triggers phosphorylation of several downstream targets that modulate cell cycle arrest and
DNA repair. ATM has also been shown to regulate HR to a
greater extent than NHEJ (40). Recent data from Beucher and
colleagues (41) confirmed the role of ATM in HR of radiationinduced DSBs in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Specific ATM
inhibitors have been developed that increased sensitivity to
radiation (42). In particular, ATM inhibition prevented PARP
inhibitor–induced HR (29). This indicated that ATM is also
required for triggering HR to resolve collapsed replication
forks after encountering SSBs and BER intermediates caused
by the inhibition of PARP, hence the use of the ATM inhibitor
here. Indeed, we found that ATM inhibition increased radiosensitization of polβ-Δ–expressing cells. Despite the fact
that targeting ATM will result in a broad inhibition spectrum, and although not specifically inhibiting HR, these data
underline the potential of such a strategy and indicate that
use of such drugs represents a feasible approach to increase
sensitization of polβ-Δ–expressing tumors to IR.
A lack of polymerase activity is a common feature of
tumor-specific polβ variants. In our studies, we therefore
used such a truncated variant of polβ, deprived of its polymerase activity. We previously showed that the expression of
this variant leads to increased radiosensitization due to
interference in BER since polβ-Δ did not radiosensitize
XRCC1-deficient cells (15). We and others further showed inhibition of BER by in vitro assays either after alkylating or
radiation damage (12–14, 20, 43). Mutations or alterations
in other proteins can also result in BER deficiency, which
should lead to accumulation of similar unrepaired intermediates, hence an increased dependence to HR. The targeted radiosensitization approach as presented here may
therefore be applicable to a broad spectrum of tumors
with BER deficiencies.
The magnitude of the increased sensitivity to radiation
with the drugs used here is less than that often seen when
comparing drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines. In
contrast to drug-induced kill, many genetic and drug studies
show that modifying radiation response will not exceed a
sensitization factor of around 3. The differential radiosensitization observed here is favorable and significant compared
with current radiosensitizing drugs such as AKT or PARP
inhibitors. It should also be noted that based on the slopes
of dose-response curves for local tumor control of clinical
tumors treated with radiotherapy alone, the degree of radiosensitization seen here could translate into significant therapeutic gains. For squamous cell carcinomas of the head and
neck, the reported γ50 slope values (percent gain in tumor
control for each percent increase in dose) typically range

between 1.5 and 2.5 (44); thus, even a small increase of
cellular radiosensitization of 10% (DEF 1.1) would result
in an additional 15% to 25% local control. Our data with
the ATM inhibitor showed a 1.5-fold increased DEF37 in
polβ-Δ–expressing versus control cells, therefore anticipating a larger effect. If applied to tumors expressing such
truncated polβ variants, this could translate to significant
increases in tumor control and, due to the discrimination
of normal and cancerous cells, to a widening of the therapeutic window.
In conclusion, the data presented here suggest that treatment with small-molecule inhibitors, which at least partially
affect HR, represent a promising new therapeutic strategy for
exploiting defects in the BER/SSBR pathway such as tumors
expressing polβ variants like those used in this study. This
would ultimately lead to greater tumor-specific cell kill,
thereby increasing the therapeutic ratio.
