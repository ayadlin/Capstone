ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinomas are well-vascularized tumors; the endothelial cells
in these tumors have a specific phenotype. Our aim was to develop a new approach
for tumor-specific drug delivery with monoclonal antibody targeting of endothelial
ligands. CD146, a molecule expressed on the endothelial surface of hepatocellular
carcinoma, was identified as a promising candidate for targeting. In the present study,
endothelial cells immediately captured circulating anti-CD146 (ME-9F1) antibody,
while antibody binding in tumors was significantly higher than in hepatic endothelium.
Macroscopically, after intravenous injection, there were no differences in the mean
accumulation of anti-CD146 antibody in tumor compared to liver tissue , due to a
compensating higher blood vessel density in the liver tissue. Additional blockade of
nontumoral epitopes and intra-arterial administration, improved selective antibody
capture in the tumor microvasculature and largely prevented antibody distribution
in the lung and liver. The potential practical use of this approach was demonstrated
by imaging of radionuclide-labeled ME-9F1 antibody, which showed excellent tumorselective uptake. Our results provide a promising principle for the use of endothelial
markers for intratumoral drug delivery. Tumor endothelium–based access might offer
new opportunities for the imaging and therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma and other
liver malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

vessels; instead, the tumor vascular system is used for
imaging and tumor-specific drug delivery [3].
The phenotype of endothelial cells in HCC differs
from the cell-surface expression profile of hepatic
endothelial cells [5;6]. One of the molecules overexpressed
on tumor endothelial cells (TECs) is CD146 [7], a celladhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily
[8]. The functions of CD146 remain relatively unexplored.
CD146 is known to participate in angiogenesis [9] and
to promote leukocyte adhesion to endothelium [10].
In the present study, we demonstrated that CD146 is
overexpressed on TECs in mouse tumors and in a fraction
of human HCCs. The expression of CD146 on tumor
endothelium was utilized in a new approach for improved
HCC-specific drug delivery and could potentially be
applied to the imaging and therapy of liver tumors.

The growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
strongly depends on the continuous development of blood
vessels to form a tumor vascular system [1]. The tumor
vasculature connects the tumor with the host and supplies
the tumor with oxygen and nutrients. Further, it drains
away metabolic and other tumor products [2]. Because
of its important biological role in tumor progression, the
tumor vascular system represents a potential diagnostic
and therapeutic target [3]. There are two types of vascularbased strategies. Anti-angiogenic therapy is directed
against the formation of new tumor blood vessels and has
been established as the therapy of choice against several
solid tumors [4]. Vascular-targeted therapy includes
different strategies that do not directly attack tumor blood

vessels (Fig. 1A). The overexpression was independent
of tumor size and was observed even in microscopic
tumors (200–500 µm). Hepatic sinusoidal blood vessels
showed a low reactivity to anti-CD146 mAb, but Lyve-1
was highly expressed (Fig. 1A, B). In liver tissue, high
expression of CD146 was mainly present in Lyve-1–
negative blood vessels in periportal fields and in zone 1 of
the liver acinus (Fig. 1A, B). Quantitative analysis using
fluorescence-based imaging demonstrated a significantly

(Fig. 1C). Double staining of Lyve-1/CD146 allowed
us to distinguish between Lyve-1(-)CD146high tumor
blood vessels in HCC and Lyve-1(+)CD146low tissue in
peritumoral liver (Fig. 1A).
Gene expression levels and the exact concentration
of CD146 protein were measured in isolated hepatic
and tumor endothelial cells. Both gene expression (Fig.
1D) and CD146 protein concentration (Fig. 1E, F) were
significantly higher in TECs compared to HECs (P=0.05).
CD146 expression was also studied in formalinfixed and frozen human HCC and normal liver specimens.
Immunohistological staining of frozen tissue revealed the
presence of CD146high and CD146low blood vessels (Fig.
1D), whereas only CD146high blood vessels were stained
in formalin-fixed tissue. Identical to what we observed
in mouse tissue, human sinusoidal blood vessels showed
low CD146 expression levels. Endothelial expression of
CD146 in human HCCs was heterogeneous: the majority
of tumor samples showed complete (49%) or incomplete
(37%) high expression, whereas 15% of samples had
low expression of CD146 (Fig. 1G, H). Cirrhosis did not
change CD146 expression in sinusoidal blood vessels, but
fibrotic connective tissue shows CD146-positive blood
vessels (Fig. 1G). There was no relationship between
differentiation grade and CD146 expression (Table 1).

The epitope for ME-9F1 mAb was thus accesible on the
intraluminal surface of endothelium.
Fluorimetric analysis of tissue homogenates showed
that the concentration of captured mAb in HCC, as well
as the “tumor:liver” ratio, were significantly higher after
intra-arterial compared to intravenous injection (Fig. 2C,
E). In contrast to tumor tissue, the mean mAb fluorescence
in lung tissue was significantly higher after intravenous
compared to intra-arterial mAb application (Fig. 2D).

Negative impact of hepatic blood vessel density on
tumor:liver ratio of captured ME-9F1 mAb
The mean blood vessel density in the liver was
significantly higher than in tumor tissue (Fig. 3F, G).
Although binding of ME-9F1 mAb on TECs was
significantly higher than in HECs (Fig. 1E,F), the mAb
content per gram of tissue was not significantly different
between liver and HCC tissue after intravenous injection
(Fig. 3B). Furthermore, PE-labeled ME-9F1 mAb bound
to endothelial cells in other tissues, such as lung, intestinal
villi, and pancreas (Fig. 3E). No binding of isotype mAb
to endothelium was found.

To study blood vessels with differential connections
to the arterial and portal venous blood supply, Alexa
Fluor 488– or PE-labeled ME-9F1 mAbs were injected
during alternate clamping of either the hepatic artery or
portal vein. mAb binding was analyzed by LSCM. Almost
all blood vessels in the liver, as well as in small tumors
(<5 mm) were labeled by both Alexa Fluor 488 and PE,
demonstrating their connection to both arterial and portal
blood supply. All microvessels in larger tumors (>5 mm)
were labeled by Alexa Fluor 488; only a few blood vessels
were labeled by PE-mAb. This demonstrates that tumor
microvessels in larger tumors were perfused only when the
hepatic artery was not clamped (Fig. 3A).

To study ME-9F1 affinity ex vivo, we analyzed
the CD146-specific MFI in histological sections,
which depended upon the addition of different mAb
concentrations and a subsequent standardized incubation
time. A 5 s exposure to 2–4 µg/ml PE-conjugated ME9F1 mAb was sufficient to achieve substantial staining of
tumor blood vessels, whereas staining of blood vessels in
the liver was significantly lower (Fig. 2A). Furthermore,
intravenous injection of PE-labeled ME-9F1 mAb
immediately stained tumor blood vessels in AlbTag,
Hep55.1C, and Panc02 tumor models in vivo (Fig. 2B).

Blocked bioavailability of nontumoral epitopes
or/and intra-arterial application of ME-9F1 mAb
provides selective access to the tumor

from the circulation within several minutes if the injected
mAb dose did not exceed 500 ng/g BW (Supplementary
Fig. 1A). Injection of mAb in doses of >500 ng/g BW
exceeded the endothelial capacity to clear the antibody
from the blood and resulted in high concentrations of
circulating mAb (Supplementary Fig. 1A).
Application of unlabeled ME-9F1 mAb occupied
free CD146 epitopes on endothelium and prevented
binding of the subsequently injected fluorescent mAb

Intravenously injected PE-labeled ME-9F1
bound to endothelium in liver and tumor tissue, but
the mean surface-bound mAb concentrations were not
significantly different (Fig. 3B). The capture of mAb due
to endothelium binding resulted in rapid mAb clearance

clamping of the hepatic artery prevented occupation of
tumor endothelial epitopes by unconjugated mAb and
improved selective binding of conjugated mAb to tumor
endothelium after removal of the clamp and subsequent

injection of fluorescence labeled ME-9F1(Fig. 3B, E).
Direct mAb injection into the hepatic artery
significantly increased the capture of mAb in the tumor

increases in intratumoral mAb binding (Fig. 3C). mAb
concentrations in the liver were increased 5 h after
intravenous injection (Supplementary Fig. 1B). This was
accompanied by high nonvascular fluorescence of liver

weak signal (Fig. 4C). Only low emission was measured
in tumor-free liver tissue after the same procedure (Fig.
4D). Intraportal injection of 125I-conjugated ME-9F1 mAb
without pretreatment produced a strong scintigraphic
signal in the liver (Fig. 4E).

DISCUSSION
The present investigation validated a new approach
to access liver tumors. This approach utilizes the binding of
specific ligands, such as antibodies, to markers expressed
on the intraluminal surface of tumor endothelium. CD146
was approximately 2.6-fold overexpressed on mouse
tumor endothelial cells compared to liver endothelial cells.
The lower difference (1.2-fold) at gene expression level
can be explained by posttranslational regulation of protein

The combination of a reduction in the nontumoral
epitope bioavailability and administration of PEconjugated ME-9F1 into the hepatic artery resulted in
preferential accumulation of labeled mAb in tumor vessels
(Fig. 4A-B). The mean tumor:liver ratio was increased
from 1.1 without block to 8.4 after blocking approach
(Fig. 4B).

synthesis. This high overexpression of CD146 in tumor
endothelium occurred in two HCC models and in mouse
pancreatic cancer inoculated in the liver. Our findings
regarding CD146 overexpression in mouse models are
likely to be relevant to humans, since the majority of
human HCCs overexpress CD146 on endothelium. Indeed,
CD146 represents only one potential molecule for use in
further translational studies. Other endothelial markers
with higher tumor specificity may be identified. So-called
“tumor endothelial markers” (TEMs) could represent
alternatives to CD146 [7;11]. However, the association
between tumors and TEMs is relative, since TEMs are not
restricted to tumor tissue and can also be found in different
organs and cell types [12]. Furthermore, TEMs may be
expressed only in a fraction of tumor blood vessels [11]
and may not provide the homogeneity required by the
present approach.
The present study also demonstrated that
endothelium-directed mAbs such as ME-9F1 bound
immediately to their epitope; this resulted in excellent
labeling of tumor blood vessels at the microscopic
level. Interestingly, the high tumor:liver ratio of antiCD146 mAb binding at the level of single endothelial
cells disappeared at the macroscopic level. This can be
explained by the higher blood vessel density in the liver,
which increased the density of mAb binding in the liver
at the macroscopic level and decreased the microscopic
contrast of mAb bound to tumor endothelium.
mAb capture in the lung after intravenous
administration was higher than after intra-arterial
injection, whereas the opposite relationship was found in
tumor tissue. This difference was due to the elimination of
mAb during the first passage through the next vascularized
organ. This organ is the lung after intravenous injection
and the tumor after intra-arterial injection. The mAb
captured in the successive organ may result in decreased
concentrations of mAb reaching subsequent organs. In
this case, mAb capture in the lung and in the tumor after
intravenous and intra-arterial administration, respectively,
follows the principle in which concentrations of the drug
at the site of intake is higher than its concentration at
the site of outcome. In pharmacokinetics, this principle
is commonly known as the “first-pass effect,” and it has
been described for the intrahepatic capture and elimination
of several drugs, such as opioids and nitroglycerin [13].
In the current study, intravenous administration also led
to reduced mAb bioavailability in the effector organ, not
through enzymatic metabolism, but through direct epitope
binding to the vasculature. Taking this principle into
consideration will help to decrease the drug load in lung
tissue and enhance tumoral drug bioavailability by directly
injecting the drug into the tumor-feeding artery.
In the present study, we used anti-CD146
immunoglobulin G (IgG). Other molecule types, such as
IgG fragments, natural soluble receptors, and peptides
with high binding affinity to the intraluminal endothelial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

surface represent promising alternatives to conventional
IgG. For example, there are two natural ligands/receptors
to CD146 that could be investigated as alternatives
to mAb: laminin-411 [14] and VEGFR2 [15]. Their
functionality should be evaluated in further studies.
As mentioned above, CD146 is a ubiquitous
endothelial marker that is expressed in other organotypic
endothelial cells. Therefore, high binding of PEconjugated ME-9F1 mAb in the lung, intestinal villi, and
pancreas was detected after systemic mAb administration.
The liver vasculature is connected to both the portal vein
and hepatic artery, whereas the artery usually supplies
HCCs [16]. As shown in the present study, temporary
clamping of the hepatic artery only interrupted blood
supply in the tumor microvasculature, demonstrating the
exclusive arterial blood supply of the tumor. Furthermore,
to achieve selective mAb binding in the tumor, the labeled
mAb was injected into the hepatic artery; alternatively,
the bioavailability of nontumoral epitopes was blocked
prior to injection of the targeting mAb. Both tools may
be relevant for translation to a clinical setting. Arterial
access to the HCC is routinely performed in transarterial
chemo- or radioembolization [17;18] and in continuous
transarterial chemotherapy [19]. Temporal clamping
of the hepatic artery is a familiar practice and is widely
used in Pringle’s maneuver (portal triad clamping) during
liver surgery [20]. The blocking procedure does not limit
the potential widespread use of the antibody. The dose
of blocking antibody is only 500ng/g BW (=0.5mg/kg)
in the case of anti-CD146. This dose is substantially
lower than the dose of established therapeutic antibodies.
For example, the single dose of antibodies such as
anti-VEGF-A [21;22], anti-HER2 [21] or “checkpoint
blocking” antibodies [23] can reach 15, 8 or 10mg/kg,
respectively.
The results of the present study show that the
intrahepatic mAb accumulation had increased several
hours after injection; this indicates that transhepatic mAb
metabolization was occurring, which had a negative
impact on the tumor:liver ratio. The use of alternative
substances or drug-bearing nanocarriers that bind to tumor
vasculature but are not metabolized in the liver would
prevent the later intrahepatic drug accumulation.
The novel targeting approach described herein has
high clinical relevance, but it requires further development
before it can be translated to therapeutic strategies. The
present study demonstrated that the use of radionuclideconjugated mAbs allows tumors to be imaged by clinically
established techniques. Administration of 125I-mAb into
the liver isolated from the circulatory system corresponds
to the basic principle used in hepatic vascular exclusion
or chemosaturation of liver tumors [24;25]. The highquality scintigraphic imaging that accompanied the use
of radionuclide-labeled mAbs supports the use of this
technique for tumor-specific drug delivery and provides a
rationale for the proposed approach.

The approach can also represent a very promising
tool for tumor therapy. However, therapeutic evaluation
is very difficult in murine models, since repeated surgery
on hepatic artery (clamping, arterial injection) would be
required. Intra-arterial application of carriers based on
tumor–endothelium targeting for imaging and therapy is
the focus of ongoing experiments.
In summary, the present study describes a new
approach for tumor specific drug delivery in HCC
and liver tumors. This approach utilizes the binding
of specific ligand to endothelial markers expressed on
the intraluminal surface of tumor endothelium. In the
present study, its technical feasibility was examplified
using monoclonal antibody binding to endothelial marker
CD146. The tumor-specific bioavailability of CD146
can be substantially increased by use of additional
methods such as blockade of nontumoral epitopes and by
intraarterial application.

Image-based
quantitative
analysis
of
immunofluorescence staining and blood vessel
density
Bound fluorescent mAb was visualized with
fluorescence microscopy (Observer.Z1; Zeiss, Jena,
Germany). The mean integrated density at three areas per
power field containing at least five vessels was measured
by immunofluorescence imaging and ImageJ software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland,
USA) [27]. Each value was corrected for background and
expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Tumor
tissue, peritumoral liver (<500 µm distance from tumor)
and normal liver were analyzed (n=6 for each).
To calculate blood vessel density, tumor or liver
slides were stained with anti-CD146 or anti-CD105,
respectively (n=11). The number of blood vessels was
counted with Histo Software (Dr. Groβ, University of
Heidelberg) and expressed per mm2.
To stain endothelial cells in vivo, PE-conjugated aniCD146 (50 ng/g body weight [BW]) and anti-Lyve-1 (200
ng/g BW) mAbs were injected intravenously in tumor-free
(n=2) or tumor-bearing mice. The tissue was dissected 15
min after injection and analyzed with the Nikon A1Rsi
confocal laser scanning system (LSCM; Nikon Europe,
Dusseldorf, Germany) as whole-mount tissue.

METHODS
Mouse tumor models
AlbTag mice expressing the oncogene SV40 large
T antigen under the control of the albumin promoter
were used at the stage of spontaneous HCC development
[26]. Hep55.1C (HCC) or Panc02 (pancreatic cancer)
cells (5×104 cells) were inoculated into the livers of
transplantable model mice (C57/Bl6). The tumor study
was performed 18–20 d after inoculation. All animal
experiments were approved by the local committee for
animal care.

Endothelial cell isolation, qRT-PCR, and ELISA
Tumor-bearing AlbTag or normal C3Heb/F mice
(11–12 weeks old) were used. Hepatic endothelial cells
(HECs) or tumor endothelial cells (TECs) were isolated by
collagenase digestion and magnetic separation with antiCD31–coated magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch
Gladbach, Germany), as previously described [5]. Isolated
cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated ME9F1.
For real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR),
total RNA from endothelial cells was isolated with the
RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR analysis was
performed with the QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR
kit and QuantiTect Primer (Qiagen). Standardization of
samples was achieved by dividing the Ct of the target gene
by that of the endogenous reference genes β-actin and
GAPDH (Qiagen). For each experiment, melting-curve
analysis and gel electrophoresis of PCR products were
performed to exclude primer dimers. Data were analyzed
by the comparative Ct method.
For ELISA, lysates from isolated endothelial cells
were used. CD146 protein concentration was determined
with the mouse MCAM-ELISA kit (USCN, Wuhan,

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Human tissue samples were provided by the tissue

committee of the University of Heidelberg. Snap-frozen
samples of eight HCCs, three normal and five cirrhotic
livers as well as formalin-fixed samples of 41 HCCs and
three livers were used.
The following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
were used: unconjugated phycoerythrin (PE)- or Alexa
Fluor 488–conjugated anti-mouse CD146 (ME-9F1),
PE-conjugated anti-CD105 (FIT-22), Alexa Fluor
488–conjugated Lyve-1 (ALY7), and Alexa Fluor 488–
conjugated anti-human CD146 (SHM-57) (all mAbs
from Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA). Anti-human
CD146 mAb was purchased from Epitomics (Burlingame,
CA, USA). Tissue slides (7 µm thickness) were stained

Fluorimetry of tissue homogenates

In six animals, bioavailability of non-tumoral
epitopes was blocked with 1000ng/g BW for 5min as
described above. Animals were sacrificed and 1ml of PElabeled ME-9F1 mAb solution (4µg/ml) was perfused
through the hepatic artery for 2min. Unbound mAb
was removed by extensive intraarterial and intraportal
perfusion of saline.
ME-9F1 mAb was conjugated with 125I, as
previously described [28]. Tumor-bearing AlbTag and
tumor-free animals were sacrificed. The blocking of
nontumoral epitopes was performed by intraportal
perfusion with 10 µg of ME-9F1 mAb diluted in 0.5 ml
of saline for 15 min. Subsequently, 5 µg of 125I-conjugated
ME-9F1 mAb diluted in 500 µl of saline was perfused
through the hepatic artery for 5 min. Finally, unbound mAb
was removed by intraarterial and intraportal perfusion
of saline. In tumor-free mice, intraportal perfusion with
125
I-mAb was performed without pretreatment with ME9F1 mAb. The animal or the dissected tumor/liver tissue
were placed on a gamma imager (Biospace Lab, Paris,
France) equipped with a high-energy collimator, and
images were recorded over 10 min. Each experiment was
performed twice.

Mice were anesthetized with 40 mg/kg ketamine
(Pfizer, Berlin, Germany) and 10 mg/kg xylazine (Bayer,
Leverkusen, Germany). Antibodies were injected
through the jugular vein or into the hepatic artery. To
access the hepatic artery, a 34G needle (Hamilton,
Bonaduz, Switzerland) was inserted into the superior
pancreaticoduodenal artery and moved forward into the
hepatic artery. To prevent blood loss from the puncture
site, the needle was fixed in the pancreaticoduodenal artery
with 10.0 thread (Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). For
temporary discontinuation of hepatic artery blood flow, the
hepatic artery was clamped with a microclip (Fine Science
Tools, Heidelberg, Germany). To block the bioavailability
of nontumoral epitopes, 500 ng/g BW unconjugated ME9F1 mAb was injected intravenously. Five minutes later,
10 ng/g BW PE-conjugated ME-9F1 mAb (100 µl) was
injected intravenously or into the hepatic artery within
5–10 s. The microclip was removed 1 min after injection.
Five minutes later, the mouse was sacrificed. Blood from
the liver was removed by intraportal perfusion with 5 ml
of saline. The tissue sample (liver, tumor, or lung) was
dissected, weighed, diluted with phosphate-buffered
saline solution (1:1), and homogenized with a manual
grinder (neoLab, Heidelberg, Germany). The content
of PE-conjugated mAb in the tissue homogenates was
determined in 384-well plates (Greiner, Frickenhausen,
Germany) in a fluorimeter (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg,
Germany). Preliminary analyses showed that PE
fluorescence was not affected after dilution in liver and
tumor homogenates, but it was strongly reduced in the
lung homogenate. Therefore, mAb concentrations in the
liver and tumor were calculated in ng/g using a calibration
curve, whereas the mAb concentration in lung homogenate
was used as a raw MFI value. Three mice per group were
used.
To study the differential connection of tumor and
liver tissue to arterial or portal venous blood supplies, 500
ng/g BW Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated ME-9F1 mAb was
injected intravenously, while the portal vein was clamped.
After 5 min, the portal vein perfusion was opened, but
the hepatic artery was clamped and PE-labeled ME-9F1
mAb (20 ng/g BW) was injected intravenously. Five
minutes later, the tumor and liver tissue were dissected
and analyzed by LSCM (Nikon). Microvessels perfused
through the hepatic artery were thus labeled with Alexa
Fluor 488, whereas blood vessels were labeled with PE,
which indicated a connection to the portal vein. PEconjugated rat IgG2a (cloneRTK2758, Biolegend) was
used as isotype control mAb.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS
software (IBM, New York, NY, USA). Data are shown
as mean ± standard deviation (SD). To study differences
between the groups, analysis of variance or Mann-Whitney
U-test were used, as appropriate. P<0.05 was considered
significant.
