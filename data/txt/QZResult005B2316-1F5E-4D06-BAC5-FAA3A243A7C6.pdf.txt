ABSTRACT
The interplay between oxidative stress and autophagy is critical for determining
the fate of cancer cells exposed to redox-active and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
agents. Mitoquinone (MitoQ), a mitochondrially-targeted redox-active ubiquinone
conjugate, selectively kills breast cancer cells over healthy mammary epithelial
cells. We reported previously that MitoQ, although a derivative of the antioxidant
ubiquinone, can generate excess ROS and trigger the Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant
response in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Following MitoQ treatment, a greater number
of cells underwent autophagy than apoptosis. However, the relationship between
MitoQ-induced oxidative stress and autophagy as a primary cellular response was
unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that MitoQ induces autophagy related gene
7 (Atg7)-dependent, yet Beclin-1-independent, autophagy marked by an increase in
LC3-II. Both the ATG7-deficient human MDA-MB-231 cells and Atg7-knockout mouse
embryonic fibroblasts exhibited lower levels of autophagy following MitoQ treatment
than their respective wild-type counterparts. Increased apoptosis was confirmed
in these autophagy-deficient isogenic cell line pairs, indicating that autophagy was
attempted for survival in wild type cell lines. Furthermore, we observed higher levels of
ROS in Atg7-deficient cells, as measured by hydroethidine oxidation. In Atg7-deficient
cells, redox-sensitive Keap1 degradation was decreased, suggesting autophagyand Atg7-dependent degradation of Keap1. Conversely, downregulation of Keap1
decreased autophagy levels, increased Nrf2 activation, upregulated cytoprotective
antioxidant gene expression, and caused accumulation of p62, suggesting a feedback
loop between ROS-regulated Keap1-Nrf2 and Atg7-regulated autophagy. Our data
indicate that excessive ROS causes the upregulation of autophagy, and autophagy
acts as an antioxidant feedback response triggered by cytotoxic levels of MitoQ.

INTRODUCTION

and DNA are oxidized and autophagy is induced [1].
Cancer cells have been reported to have higher levels of
ROS than normal cells due to mitochondrial and metabolic
dysfunction. While it might suppress tumor development,
in these circumstances autophagy can support cancer
progression by helping cells to survive in the stressful
environment [2, 3].
Beclin-1 and its binding partner class III
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) are required for the
formation of autophagosomes [4]. During autophagosome
maturation, microtubule-associated protein lightchain 3 (LC3-I) is cleaved and then conjugated with

Autophagy is a conserved lysosomal degradation
pathway that ensures quality control of the cytoplasmic
contents. In the normal cell, autophagy is present at
low levels; damaged cellular organelles and protein
aggregates are engulfed in autophagosomes to be degraded
and recycled. However, under toxic stimuli, excessive
autophagy can remove essential cellular components and
may lead to cell death. During oxidative stress, when the
amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) exceeds the
capacity of the antioxidant machinery, proteins, lipids,

phosphatidylethanolamine into LC3-II, a process mediated
by the autophagy-related (Atg) proteins Atg7 and Atg3 [5].
Lipidated LC3-II is bound to the membrane of the
autophagosome until fusion with the lysosome is complete.
Thus, LC3-II acts as a biochemical marker for autophagy
[6]. LC3-II is bound directly by the p62/SQSTM1 protein
(hereafter referred to as p62), an autophagy substrate that
serves as a cargo receptor for autophagic degradation
of ubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated substrate [7, 8].
Reduced levels of p62 can be used to confirm autophagic
flux while accumulation of p62 is an indication of potential
autophagy impairment [9]. Despite what is known about
the mechanism of autophagy induction in normal cells, it
remains unclear how Beclin-1, Atg7, and p62 signal for
autophagy under excessive ROS conditions.
The Keap1–Nrf2 pathway senses free radicals
and protects the cell during excessive oxidative and
electrophilic conditions [10]. Keap1 regulates Nrf2
activity by binding and consequently mediating its
polyubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation
under non-stressed conditions. Under stressful conditions,
Nrf2 is released and accumulates in the nucleus where it
binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) sequence
and induces the expression of cytoprotective antioxidant
genes. In the absence of autophagy, p62 can accumulate
and compete with Nrf2 to bind with Keap1. The association
of p62 with Keap1 allows Nrf2 to activate antioxidant gene
expression [11]. In addition, the P62 gene contains the ARE
promoter region, allowing Nrf2 to induce expression of P62
under stressful conditions. This leads to a positive feedback
loop where p62 activates Nrf2; constant Nrf2 activation
stimulates P62 expression under prolonged cellular stress.
However, p62 is not required for initial activation of
Nrf2 [12]. Keap1 mutation or p62 accumulation leads to a
constitutively active Nrf2, which contributes to the growth
of cancer cells [13-17]. Mutations that constitutively
activate Nrf2 may contribute to tumorigenesis and
chemoresistance in solid tumors [18]. Because absence of
Keap1 leads to protein aggregation, it has been proposed
that Keap1 plays a role in ubiquitin aggregate clearance via
autophagy through association with LC3-II and p62 [19].
Furthermore, Keap1 accumulates in the absence
of Atg7 or p62, indicating that autophagy and p62 are
required for degradation of Keap1 [12, 20]. The p62 protein
is phosphorylated during autophagy, which increases its
affinity for Keap1 [17]. This increase in affinity causes the
sequestration of Keap1 and p62 on autophagic cargos and
their subsequent degradation [17, 21].
Excessive production of ROS via the mitochondrial
electron transport chain can lead to oxidative damage if
there is an imbalance between ROS and the antioxidant
defense mechanism. Therefore, targeting an antioxidant
directly to the mitochondria may decrease oxidative
damage and protect the cells [22]. Our earlier work
showed that Mitoquinone (MitoQ), a synthetic derivative
of the antioxidant ubiquinone (CoQ10), induces oxidative
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stress and activates the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway [23, 24].
Although originally developed as an antioxidant, MitoQ
has been reported to undergo redox cycling, produce ROS,
and disrupt the inner mitochondrial membrane potential
[23, 25]. Additionally, MitoQ exhibits selective anticancer
activity and is more cytotoxic to cancer cells than healthy
cells [23, 26]. In this report, we examined how Keap1
signals for an antioxidant response in the absence of
autophagy and demonstrate that cross-talk between
Atg7- and Keap1- dependent autophagy is a cell survival
mechanism in response to MitoQ-induced oxidative stress.

RESULTS
MitoQ induces Beclin-1-independent and Atg7dependent autophagy
To better understand the role of Beclin-1 or Atg7 in
MDA-MB-231 cells exposed to MitoQ, we first optimized
conditions for the downregulation of Beclin-1 or Atg7
protein using 10 nM siRNA oligonucleotides for 48 hr
(Figure 1A and Figure 1B, respectively). We observed
90% knockdown of both proteins under these conditions.
Non-targeting pool (NTP) siRNA oligonucleotides were
used as controls. Cells transfected with control NTP
siRNA as well as Beclin-1 siRNA showed an increase in
LC3-II protein levels by Western blot following treatment
with 1 µM or 5 µM MitoQ for 24 hr (Figure 1C).
Downregulation of Beclin-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells had
no significant effect upon the MitoQ-induced increase in
autophagy. This indicates that MitoQ-induced autophagy
is independent of Beclin-1 in MDA-MB-231 cells.
However, in Atg7 siRNA-transfected cells, treatment
with 5 µM MitoQ induced significantly lower levels
of LC3-II compared to NTP siRNA transfected cells
(Figure 1D). Rapamycin (10 µM) served as a positive
control in each experiment. To confirm this observation,
MDA-MB-231 cells were immunostained with anti-LC3II antibody [27]. Consistent with Western blot analysis,
cells treated with Atg7 siRNA showed lower LC3-II
intensity per cell following treatment with 5 µM MitoQ
for 24 hr (Figure 1E) as indicated by comparing the
fluorescence intensities between control and Atg7 siRNA
cells (Figure 1F).
To confirm that Atg7 is required for MitoQ-induced
autophagy, we measured LC3-II levels in isogenic MEFs,
wild type Atg7+/+ or Atg7−/−, exposed to either 1 µM or
5 µM MitoQ for 24 hr (Figure 2B). Following treatment
with 5 µM MitoQ, MEF Atg7+/+ cells showed an increase
in LC3-II with respect to control while LC3-II was not
detectable in MEF Atg7−/− control or treated cells. In
particular, a higher concentration of MitoQ (5 µM) was
required to induce autophagy in MEF Atg7+/+ than in
breast cancer cells, which is consistent with previous
observations [23, 26].

To establish whether autophagy protects cells
from MitoQ-induced cell death, we measured annexin
V-PI positive staining. A significant increase in annexin
V-PI positive staining was observed in Atg7−/− MEF
cells compared to Atg7+/+ MEF cells following 24 and
48 hr of MitoQ treatment (Figure 2C). Vp16 (10 µM), a
positive control for apoptosis, also caused a significant
increase in annexinV-PI positive staining in Atg7−/− after
48 hr treatment. Lack of Atg7 enhanced MitoQ-induced
apoptosis, which suggests that autophagy protects cells
from MitoQ-induced cell death.

an increase in one-electron oxidation of HE, possibly
due to increased ROS formation, and that autophagy
is required to decrease MitoQ-induced ROS. Due to
increased level of diethidium, which is a specific marker
of one-electron oxidation of the probe, the increased
level of 2-OH-E+ may be interpreted not only in view of
increased production of superoxide radical anion, but also
increased one-electron oxidant(s), or both.
To determine the impact of autophagic signaling on
oxidative stress-induced gene expression, we measured
the expression levels of antioxidant genes in autophagy
deficient Atg7−/− or wild type Atg7+/+ MEFs. Deletion of
Atg7 induced downregulation of basal expression levels
of cytoprotective genes, including heme oxygenase-1
(Hmox1), and peroxiredoxin 2 (Prdx2) (Supplemental
Table 1). Conversely, treatment with 5 µM MitoQ for
24 hr upregulated the expression of the Nrf2-targeted
genes, Hmox1, and P62 in autophagy deficient Atg7−/−
and wild type Atg7+/+MEFs. Drug-induced upregulation
of Hmox1 and P62 was higher in wild type cells than
in autophagy deficient cells, indicative of an autophagic
antioxidant role by triggering antioxidant gene expression.
These data are also in agreement with the increased oneelectron oxidation of hydroethidine in autophagy-deficient
cells following MitoQ treatment (Figure 3B).

Autophagy reduces MitoQ-induced ROS levels
To determine whether autophagy can modulate
MitoQ-induced ROS, ROS production was measured in
autophagy-deficient cells using an HPLC-based assay
to identify hydroethidine (HE) oxidation products in
autophagy deficient Atg7−/− or wild type Atg7+/+ MEFs
following treatment with 5 µM MitoQ for 0.5, 2, 6, or
24 hr (Figure 3A). Increase in HE oxidation product
2-hydroxyethidium (2-OH-E+) was statistically significant
in Atg7+/+ cells following 0.5 and 1hr of MitoQ treatment,
and in Atg7−/− cells following 6hr of MitoQ treatment
(Figure 3B). Statistically significant changes of ethidium
(E+) were only observed in Atg7−/− cells following 24 hr of
MitoQ treatment. Moreover, 2-OH-E+, E+, and diethidium
(E+-E+) were increased in autophagy-deficient cells to a
greater extent than autophagy-proficient cells following
treatment with 5 µM MitoQ for 24 hr. 2-OH-E+ levels
were higher in Atg7+/+ following 6 hr of MitoQ treatment.
However, statistically significant changes were only
observed for E+ levels following 24 hr of 5 µM MitoQ
treatment. The increased levels of 2-OH-E+, E+, and E+-E+
in autophagy-deficient cells after MitoQ treatment indicate

autophagic flux, we inhibited the degradation of LC3-II
by using pepstatin A and E64d [6]. Stabilization of LC3-II
resulted in increased levels in NTP- and Keap1- siRNA
transfected cells following MitoQ exposure (Figure 5C).
We then hypothesized that the difference in
autophagy response observed in Keap1 deficient cells
could be due to the fact that the antioxidant transcription
factor Nrf2 is constitutively active, therefore excess free
radicals are better scavenged and autophagy is not trigged.
We analyzed the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 following
MitoQ exposure. Basal levels of Nrf2 transcriptional
activity increased in Keap1 siRNA- transfected cells, as
did activity in NTP- and Keap1 siRNA- transfected cells
following MitoQ exposure (Figure 5D). Significantly
higher Nrf2 transcriptional activity was measured in
Keap1 siRNA- than NTP siRNA- transfected cells
following MitoQ treatment. To determine whether
depletion of Keap1 had an effect on Nrf2-regulated
gene expression, we measured the expression levels of
antioxidant genes. Silencing Keap1 induced higher basal

Depletion of Keap1 reduces MitoQ-induced

To establish whether a feedback loop helps Keap1
regulate autophagy, we assayed LC3-II levels by Western
blot in MDA-MB-231 cells with siRNA downregulation
of Keap1. Optimal conditions for Keap1 knockdown
were determined to be 10 nM siRNA oligonucleotides
for 24 hr (Figure 5A). We observed MitoQ induced
autophagy following 24 hr exposure; however, induction
of autophagy was lower in Keap1 siRNA transfected cells
compared to the control cells transfected with NTP siRNA
(Figure 5B). Downregulation of Keap1 also decreased the
basal levels of autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells. These
data suggest that in the absence of Keap1, autophagy
response is diminished. To confirm that the increase in

Figure 5: Depletion of Keap1 reduces MitoQ-induced autophagy and increases transcriptional activity of the
antioxidant Nrf2. (A) MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of siRNA oligonucleotides for 24 hr to optimize
the downregulation of Keap1. Cells were treated with 10 nM Keap1 siRNA or control NTP siRNA for 24 hr before being treated with
MitoQ (1 or 5 µM) for 24 hr. (B) LC3-II protein was used as an autophagy marker. Rapamycin (10 µM) was used as a positive control.
(C) Autophagic flux was determined by treating cells with the lysosomal protease inhibitors Pepstatin A (10 µg/ml) and E64d (10 µg/ml)
in the presence or absence of MitoQ (1 or 5 µM) for 24 hr. (D) The transcriptional activity of Nrf2 was measured with an assay with
immobilized oligonucleotide containing the ARE consensus binding site. tBHQ (20 µM) was used as a positive control. Error bars represent
S.D. *statistical significance compared with NTP siRNA cells. (E) Autophagy impairment was measured by observing levels of the

levels of Nrf2 regulated genes such as HMOX1, NQO1,
and P62 than from NTP siRNA (Supplemental Table 2).
However, drug-induced upregulation of HMOX1, NQO1,
and P62 was diminished in response to MitoQ in Keap1
siRNA cells when compared to NTP siRNA cells.
As our data showed that the absence of Keap1
upregulates P62 gene expression, we tested whether
p62 protein level increases in the absence of Keap1.
Downregulation of Keap1 induced greater p62
accumulation, independent of MitoQ (Figure 5E).
Together, these data showed that absence of Keap1
induces p62 protein accumulation.

induces autophagy independent of Beclin-1 and dependent
on Atg7; ii) deletion of Atg7 increases ROS levels in
response to MitoQ treatment; iii) Atg7 is required for
Keap1 degradation; and iv) knockdown of Keap1 increases
Nrf2 transcriptional activity, upregulates antioxidant genes
expression, and decreases autophagy.
Based on these findings, we propose that MitoQ
increases ROS levels, resulting in induction of autophagy,
which in turn exhibits a feedback antioxidant function (see
model in Figure 6). MitoQ-induced ROS causes Keap1
oxidation followed by degradation via autophagy, and as a
result, activation of Nrf2 [23, 29]. Nrf2 activation induces
the expression of the antioxidant genes and P62. The p62
protein in turn associates with Keap1 and activates Nrf2,
resulting in a positive feedback loop. We hypothesize that
degradation of Keap1, the subsequent activation of Nrf2,
and the expression of the antioxidant genes including
p62, will decrease oxidative damage and consequently
inhibit autophagy. It is possible that the induced levels
of p62 gene expression by Keap1/Nrf2 are independent

DISCUSSION
Autophagy can promote cell survival in response to
stress [28]. In this study, we investigated the mechanism
by which MitoQ induces autophagy via the cellular
oxidative stress response. We demonstrated that: i) MitoQ

of Atg7-dependent autophagy because the levels of p62
expression were comparable in the Atg7 deficient and
proficient cell lines.
Our data demonstrate that MitoQ-induced autophagy
depends on Atg7 but not on Beclin-1. From previous
studies it appears that Beclin-1-independent autophagy can
occur in cancer cells as well as neurons following treatment
with agents that induce cell death [30-32]. Therefore, a
non-canonical pathway that does not require Beclin-1 or
another redundant protein might be performing the same
function to promote cell survival or cell death following
drug treatment [33, 34]. As has been reported in hepatic
cells [10], Atg7 is required for Keap1 degradation in two
different model systems: MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell
lines and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The kinetics of
degradation was more prominent in MDA-MB-231 Atg7
siRNA cells than Atg7 knock-out MEFs. The reason for
this might be the partial depletion of Atg7 using siRNA
conditions versus an absence of Atg7 in knock-out cells.
Additionally, Keap1 is almost completely degraded in
MDA-MB-231 cells by 24 hr but not in MEFs, which
might also be due to the presence of low levels of Atg7
in the siRNA MDA-MB-231 cells. These observations
confirm that Keap1 is, at least partially, degraded via
autophagy [29]. Moreover, we showed an increase in
one-electron oxidation in autophagy deficient cells, which
could be due to increase in superoxide and/or peroxidaselike activity [35, 36]. In addition, MitoQ decreased the
ratio of reduced to oxidized (GSH/GSSG) glutathione
in autophagy deficient cells, which demonstrates a more
oxidized intracellular environment in the absence of
autophagy (data not shown). Increase in cell death via
apoptosis and upregulation of cytoprotective genes in
Atg7-deficient cells following MitoQ treatment indicates
that autophagy is a cytoprotective response to rescue MEF
cells from stress-induced death. Downregulation of basal
levels of cytoprotective genes in the absence of autophagy/
Atg7 demonstrated that expression of cytoprotective genes
is dependent on MitoQ treatment/ROS. Moreover, higher
expression of cytoprotective genes in the presence of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

autophagy confirmed that autophagy may be required to
degrade Keap1, activate Nrf2, and express Nrf2-regulated
genes. We demonstrate that lack of Keap1 decreases
autophagy as well as increases Nrf2 transcriptional activity
and antioxidant gene expression. In the absence of Keap1,
basal expression levels of antioxidant genes are higher than
the MitoQ-inducible levels, which are diminished. Previous
work from our group suggested that Keap1 is a redox sensor
and its oxidation targets it for degradation and subsequent
Nrf2 activation [23]. The observed differences between
basal levels and inducible levels of gene expression may
be a consequence of Nrf2 being constitutively active.
However it is also possible that another redox sensor is
required to upregulate genes expression following MitoQ
treatment. MitoQ-induced autophagy increases in the
absence of Nrf2 [23]. We propose that autophagy decreases
in the absence of Keap1 because there are lower levels of
ROS following increased Nrf2 activation. Nrf2 could be
activated either by degradation of Keap1 via autophagy,
or by association of phosphorylated p62 with Keap1 [11,
15, 17, 37]. The accumulation of p62 when Keap1 was
downregulated is consistent with Nrf2-mediated p62
upregulation and the positive feedback loop that they form
[12]. However, it is also possible that Keap1 is required
for p62 degradation because autophagosome formation is
defective in Keap1 knockout cells [19]. Our findings are
also in concordance with previous reports relating the role
of p62 in the regulation of Nrf2 activity and expression
of Nqo1 to maintain mitochondrial quality control [38].
Therefore, autophagy has an antioxidant role by degrading
Keap1 to allow the release and activation of Nrf2 and the
expression of cytoprotective antioxidant genes. It is likely
that autophagy may be just one of different pathways
involved in Keap1 degradation. Since Keap1degradation
following MitoQ treatment was not completely abrogated
in the absence of Atg7, it is possible that Keap1 is degraded
by more than one pathway, including an Atg7-independent
pathway [39].
Our present study demonstrates that MitoQ induces
ROS, triggering the autophagy pathway which induces
1533

a cytoprotective antioxidant response. Treatment with
an exogenous antioxidant (glutathione monoethyl
ester) protected cells from MitoQ-induced autophagy
(data not shown), confirming the role of excess ROS in
signaling for autophagy. Previous studies have shown
that ROS stimulates autophagy by modifying autophagy
related proteins [40, 41]. Here we showed that ROSinduced autophagy degrades Keap1 and induces Nrf2
activation. The purpose of MitoQ-induced autophagy
in cancer cells is to activate the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway
and reduce oxidative stress. Further study is required to
determine whether autophagy directly interferes with
mitochondrial ROS production and other targets of free
radical damage by eliminating damaged mitochondria
through mitophagy. Further analysis is also necessary
to understand the regulation of the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway
in cancer treatment with autophagy inducers or
inhibitors. Inhibition of autophagy would also lead to
p62 accumulation and constitutive activation of Nrf2,
offering tumor cells a defense against oxidative stressinducing agents supporting the development of Nrf2
inhibitors as a therapeutic tool to enhance the function of
chemotherapeutic drugs.

or 24 hr (for Keap1 siRNA) at 37°C in 5% CO2 before
treating cells with drugs in fresh media.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

MDA-MB-231 cells were plated and transfected
with siRNA on chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockville, MD). Following drug treatment, cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and subsequently
permeabilized with 100 µg/mL digitonin in PBS. Cell
were treated with 1% BSA and incubated with anti-LC3II (MBL, Woburn, MA), followed by secondary antibody
conjugated with Alexa dyes (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA). Slides were mounted with cover-slips with DAPIcontaining mounting solution (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA). Digital images were acquired with
a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal system using a 63X oilimmersion objective.

Western blotting
Cell and tissue lysate were prepared as described
previously [23] and quantified by BCA assay. Total protein
(~20-30 µg) was loaded and resolved in a Novex 4-12%
Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Protein
was transferred to an Immobilon-P PVDF membrane
(Millipore, Billerica, MA) and probed with anti-LC3-II
(Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), anti-Beclin-1 (Novus
Biologicals, Littleton, CO), anti-Atg7 (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO), anti-p62 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) or anti-Keap1
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies.
Anti-α–tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA)
or anti-GAPDH (Imgenex, San Diego, CA) were used as
loading controls. Protein levels were quantified using
densitometric scanning and normalized to loading control
levels.

Immunohistochemistry

Chemicals
MitoQ was synthesized as described previously
[23]. tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), Etoposide (Vp-16),
Rapamycin, Pepstatin A, and E64d were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Cell culture
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained
from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in
DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate (Mediatech, Manassas, VA). Mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) with Atg7+/+ and Atg7−/−genotypes were
generously provided by Dr. Masaaki Komatsu (Tokyo
Metropolitan Institute) and cultured in DMEM containing
10% FBS, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate.
Cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2.

Annexin-V staining
For apoptosis analysis, post-treatment and control
MEF cells were collected and stained using an Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit II (BD Pharmingen, San
Jose, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Stained cells
were analyzed by a FACSCaliber flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
