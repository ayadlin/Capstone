Abstract
We investigated the regulatory effect of insulin receptor
substrate-1 (IRS-1) on transforming growth factor-B1 (TGFB1)–induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
TGF-B1–induced EMT and cell migration in A549 cells are
associated with a decrease in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation
and protein levels. Tissue microarray analysis of human lung
carcinoma shows a correlation between IRS-1 protein levels
and E-cadherin protein levels. High IRS-1 levels coexist with
high E-cadherin levels, whereas low IRS-1 levels coexist with
low E-cadherin levels, implying a possibility that IRS-1 protein
levels may be linked with EMT. Surprisingly, overexpression
of IRS-1 in A549 cells completely blocked TGF-B1–induced
EMT and cell migration, inhibited TGF-B1–mediated expression of snail and slug genes, and abolished TGF-B1–mediated
repression of E-cadherin promoter activity. In contrast, IRS-1
knockdown by RNAi increased the expression of snail and
slug genes and induced EMT. Inhibition of protein tyrosine
phosphatase with sodium vanadate, which greatly increased
the levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1, suppressed
TGF-B1–induced actin remodeling and cell morphologic
changes. These results show for the first time that TGF-B1
induces EMT through mechanisms involving the modulation
of IRS-1 signaling, and that IRS-1 functions as a critical EMT
suppressor that suppresses TGF-B1–induced EMT via inhibition of snail and slug expression. [Cancer Res 2009;69(18):7180–7]

Introduction
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a tightly controlled
process that is critical for various biological events such as embryomorphogenesis, fibrotic diseases, tumor metastasis, etc. EMT
gives cells the ability of migration and invasion, and reflects most
typically the plasticity of epithelial cells (1–5). In embryonic
development, EMT is a temporally and spatially highly controlled
and coordinated process. The migratory cells from EMT automatically lose their high mobility when they reach their destination,
which is required for morphogenesis and organogenesis. In
contrast, as one of the major causes of tumor progression (6),
EMT is dysregulated in cancer cells. In tumor metastasis,
carcinoma cells acquire a mesenchymal phenotype, leading to
enhanced motility and the acquirement of the ability to evade

apoptosis; these changes allow tumor cells to metastasize and
establish secondary tumors at distant sites.
Increasing numbers of signaling molecules implicated in the
control of EMT during embryogenesis and cancer progression are
emerging (7). Members of multipotent cytokine transforming
growth factor (TGF)-h superfamily play important roles in the
control of cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and aging.
TGF-h1 is also the most widely used inducer of EMT for in vitro
studies. Snail and slug zinc-finger transcriptional factors are
known as repressors of E-cadherin gene, which act as the
inducers of EMT, and play critical roles in TGF-h1–induced
EMT (8, 9). TGF-h1–induced simultaneously occurring EMT
and apoptosis has been shown to be cell cycle state–dependent
events (10, 11). Although a number of molecules involved in
TGF-h1–mediated EMT have been identified, the mechanisms
need to be further investigated.
Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a member of the insulin
receptor substrate family and is an important mediator in insulinlike growth factor-I/insulin signaling (12). IRS-1 functions as an
adaptor molecule in signal transduction and was regulated by
some cytokines. IRS-1 does not have kinase activity but it can be
phosphorylated by growth factors and other stimuli (13). Activation
or inactivation of IRS-1 is highly correlated with the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of IRS-1 tyrosine residues. Decrease in
the tyrosine phosphorylation or protein levels of IRS-1 was
reportedly associated with growth arrest or apoptosis of cancer
cells induced by certain stimuli (14–17). The role of IRS-1 in tumor
progression or metastasis has been extensively characterized in
recent years. The decreased IRS-1 level was shown to be correlated
with the progression of breast cancer (18), and the loss of IRS-1 has
been considered as an early event in the non–small cell lung cancer
development (19). IRS-1 seems to function as a suppressor for
tumor metastasis (20–22). Knockout of IRS-1 promotes human
mammary tumor metastasis, and ectopic expression of IRS-1 in
LNCaP (human prostate cancer cells) increases cell adhesion and
decreases cell motility. It has been reported that overexpression of
IRS-1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells blocks TGF-h1–
induced apoptosis (23). IRS-1 has also been shown to play an
important role in adipocyte differentiation (24, 25) and in selfrenewal of murine embryonic stem cells (26). Inhibition of serine
phosphorylation and the increase in protein levels of IRS-1 have
been shown to be associated with rapamycin-induced vascular
smooth muscle cell differentiation (27).
Although it is known that IRS-1 activity can be regulated by
many stimuli, it is not clear whether IRS-1 plays a role in EMT and
whether IRS-1 is a target of TGF-h1 signaling. The relationship
between IRS-1 and snail or slug also remains unidentified. In this
study, we investigated the regulation of IRS-1 by TGF-h1 and its
role in the control of EMT. We also determined whether snail and
slug are targets of IRS-1 signaling.

become very pronounced after 48 hours. The time effect of cell
morphologic changes suggests that EMT process is a progressive
multistep event (Fig. 1A). TGF-h1 also significantly reduced the
E-cadherin, but increased the vimentin levels (Fig. 1B). TGF-h1–
induced EMT was associated with increased cell migration as
shown by the cell scratch and the transwell assays (Fig. 1C, top and
bottom), indicating that EMT increased the cell mobility. Although
TGF-h1 can induce EMT, it has no obvious inhibitory effect on the
proliferation of A549 cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that growth arrest
may not be required for TGF-h1–induced EMT in these cells.
Alterations of IRS-1 in TGF-B1–induced EMT and in human
lung carcinoma specimens. Because the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 reflects its activity, we detected the effect of TGF-h1
treatment on the phosphorylated-IRS-1 levels. As shown in Fig. 2A,
after the immunoprecipitation with IRS-1 antibody, the reduced
IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation levels were observed by immunoblotting with the phospho-tyrosine–specific antibody p-tyr-102 (top
left). The results showed that decreased phosphorylated IRS-1 level
in response to TGF-h1 can be detected by immunoblotting after
the immunoprecipitation with p-tyr-102 antibody (top right). TGFh1–induced down-regulation of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation
was also detected through IRS-1 immunoprecipitation followed by
immunoblotting with p-tyr-102 phospho-tyrosine antibody (middle). Using antibody against phosphorylated tyr612 of IRS-1/2,
TGF-h1–induced decrease in the amount of IRS-1 phosphorylated

at tyr612 in A549 cells was observed (bottom). IRS-1 protein levels
have been shown to be down-regulated by some stimuli, such as
insulin, dexamethasone, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(TPA; refs. 30–32). Here, we examined whether the changes of IRS-1
protein levels are associated with TGF-h1–mediated EMT. As
shown in Fig. 2B, there is a decrease in IRS-1 protein levels after
TGF-h1 treatment (top). A decrease in IRS-1 mRNA levels was also
detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR; middle and
bottom). In addition, we compared the IRS-1 and the E-cadherin
levels in tissues microarray of well-differentiated squamous cell
lung carcinoma by immunofluorescence analysis. As shown in
Fig. 2C, concurrent high- or low-expression levels of IRS-1 and
E-cadherin were observed in different specimens of human lung
carcinoma. These results were also observed by double immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 2D). Of the 30 lung cancer samples
examined, 24 specimens displayed a strong correlation between the
levels of IRS-1 and E-cadherin. Among these 24 specimens,
7 carcinomas showed a concurrent down-regulation of E-cadherin
and IRS-1 expression, and 17 carcinomas exhibited higher
expression of both IRS-1 and E-cadherin (P = 0.004, calculated by
Fisher’s exact test). The data further confirmed that modulation of
IRS-1 is an important event in the control of EMT.
IRS-1 overexpression blocks TGF-B1–induced EMT and cell
migration. The regulation of IRS-1 by TGF-h1 suggests that IRS-1
play a role in TGF-h1–induced EMT. Thus, we performed

additional experiments to verify this role. Wild-type IRS-1 was
overexpressed in A549 cells through stable transfection (Fig. 3A,
top). Interestingly, the overexpression of IRS-1 increased both basal
protein and tyrosine phosphorylation levels (Fig. 3A, bottom). To

our surprise, the overexpression of IRS-1 abolished TGF-h1–
induced EMT, as shown by the changes in cell morphology
(Fig. 3B, top) and the vimentin and E-cadherin levels (Fig. 3B,
middle). IRS-1 overexpression also inhibited TGF-h1–induced cell

migration (Fig. 3B, bottom). Because the IRS-1 overexpression
increased both basal protein and tyrosine phosphorylation levels,
we attempted to look into the effect of the status of IRS-1 tyrosine
phosphorylation on EMT. Treatment of cells with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate markedly increased the tyrosinephosphorylated IRS-1 levels and blocked TGF-h1–induced IRS-1
tyrosine dephosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Noticeably, sodium vanadate
treatment suppressed TGF-h1–induced cell morphologic changes
(Fig. 3D, top) and the actin remodeling (Fig. 3D, bottom).
To confirm the role of IRS-1 in EMT process, similar experiments
were performed in Mv1Lu cell line. As shown in Fig. 4A, TGF-h1 also
induced EMT in Mv1Lu cells, as seen by cell morphologic changes,
decreased E-cadherin and increased vimentin and fibronectin levels,
and increased cell migration. We also observed a decrease in the
levels of IRS-1 in TGF-h1–induced EMT in this cell line. In IRS-1
stably transfected cell clones (Fig. 4B), TGF-h1–induced EMT was
also suppressed, as shown by the cell morphologic phenotype, the
levels of protein markers, and the cell migration status (Fig. 4C).
Because TGF-h1 also strongly inhibits the proliferation of Mv1Lu
cells (Fig. 4D, top), we examined the role of IRS-1 on TGF-h1–
induced growth arrest, and found that the overexpression of
IRS-1 partially abolished the growth-inhibitory effect of TGF-h1
(4D, bottom). These results indicate that IRS-1 is critical in
suppressing the TGF-h1–induced EMT and cell migration.
IRS-1 knockdown by RNAi induces EMT and cell migration.
To further confirm the role of IRS-1 in EMT, IRS-1 in A549 cells was
knocked down by RNAi, and two IRS-1 RNAi clones were selected
and examined (Fig. 5A). IRS-1 down-regulation by RNAi induced
strikingly a mesenchymal phenotype and significantly enhanced
TGF-h1–induced morphologic alterations of EMT (Fig. 5B, top),

www.aacrjournals.org

supporting the conclusion that IRS-1 functions as an EMT
suppressor. Further experiments showed that respective changes
in the levels of E-cadherin and vimentin occurred in IRS-1 RNAi
cells (Fig. 5B, bottom). Consistent with the above results, IRS-1
down-regulation by RNAi also increased TGF-h1–induced cell
migration (Fig. 5C). Transient transfection of cells with IRS-1 siRNA
also resulted in distinct morphologic changes (Fig. 5D, top) and the
E-cadherin down-regulation (Fig. 5D, bottom). These results show
that IRS-1 is critical in maintaining the epithelial phenotype and in
suppressing the EMT of A549 cells.
IRS-1 modulates snail and slug expression levels and
E-cadherin transcriptional activities. We also observed that
TGF-h1 treatment induced an increase in the mRNA (Fig. 6A, top)
and protein (Fig. 6A, middle and bottom) levels of snail and slug in
A549 cells. Down-regulation of IRS-1 by RNAi increased the basal
mRNA (Fig. 6B, top) and protein (Fig. 6B, middle and bottom) levels
of snail and slug. In sharp contrast, stable transfection of wild-type
IRS-1 suppressed TGF-h1–induced snail and slug gene expressions
(Fig. 6C). Because IRS-1 regulates snail and slug mRNA level, we
examined whether IRS-1 overexpression modulate E-cadherin
transcription. As it was shown in Fig. 6D, transient transfection
of IRS-1 abrogated the TGF-h1–mediated repression of E-cadherin
promoter activity in A549 cells. These data indicate for the first
time that IRS-1 is an EMT suppressor, which functions via a
mechanism involving the inhibition of snail and slug expression.

Discussion
To study the underlying mechanism of TGF-h1–induced EMT,
we examined the role of IRS-1. The tyrosine phosphorylation of

IRS-1 has been widely considered to be a hallmark for its
activation. A decrease in tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 can
generally be considered as an inhibition of IRS-1 activity induced
by TGF-h1. In addition, IRS-1 can be phosphorylated at different
serine/threonine sites by various protein kinases (13). Thus far, no
evidence has been reported showing the serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by TGF-h1. Although the IRS-1 protein levels
can be down-regulated by insulin, dexamethasone, and TPA (30–32),
the regulation of IRS-1 by TGF-h1 has not been examined and
reported. In the presented study, we observed that TGF-h1
treatment induced a decrease in the IRS-1 protein and phosphorylation levels, implying a potential role of IRS-1 in TGF-h1–
mediated biological functions.
Although IRS-1 has been reported to be involved in many
physiologic processes, its role in EMT remained uncharacterized.
The findings on the regulation of IRS-1 in TGF-h1–induced EMT
provided evidence on the new biological function of IRS-1. Our data
showed that IRS-1 is critical for maintaining the epithelial
phenotype of A549 cells and it acts as a suppressor of EMT. The
cell morphologic changes of EMT takes place around 24 hours after
TGF-h1 treatment, and the most typical mesenchymal phenotype
are generally observed after 36 to 48 hours. The decrease in

tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 can be detected 4 hours after TGFh1 treatment, suggesting that the regulation of IRS-1 tyrosine
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is an early signaling event
implicated in TGF-h1–induced EMT. In association with the EMT
process, there is a gradual decrease in the levels of IRS-1 proteins.
We also observed the correlation between IRS-1 and E-cadherin
expression in human lung carcinoma specimens. Although the
down-regulation of IRS-1 by TGF-h1 is not an early event, it is
required for EMT, as shown by IRS-1 overexpression and
knockdown experiments. Ectopic expression of wild-type IRS-1 in
Mv1Lu cells also inhibited TGF-h1–induced EMT, which provides
further experimental evidence supporting a role of IRS-1 in the
suppression of EMT.
In A549 cells overexpressing IRS-1, TGF-h1 still induced the
dephosphorylation of IRS-1, but the tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1
levels in cells treated with TGF-h1 still remained higher than that
in vector-transfected control cells, indicating that increased IRS-1
and its activated form played a role in suppressing the EMT. IRS-1
overexpression elevated not only the basal IRS-1 protein levels but
also the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 levels; these evidence
suggest that there is a basal IRS-1 phosphorylation activity that
accounts for increased IRS-1 phosphorylation. In contrast,

Modulation of EMT by IRS-1

treatment of cells with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium
vanadate greatly increased the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and
blocked TGF-h1–induced morphologic phenotype of EMT, suggesting that there is also a basal phosphatase activity that can
dephosphorylate the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1. The balance
between the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation sustains a
relatively high IRS-1 phosphorylation level, which is required for
maintaining the epithelial phenotype of the cells. The disruption of
this balance by TGF-h1 plays at least partly a role in the induction
of EMT. Because sodium vanadate also increased phosphorylatedtyrosine levels of other proteins, we cannot conclude that increased
IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation accounts for its inhibitory effect on
TGF-h1–induced EMT. Considering the facts that changes in either
the protein levels or the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of IRS-1
pronouncedly affected EMT, we propose that both the dephosphorylation and the protein down-regulation of IRS-1 are
important in TGF-h1–induced EMT. Because changes in the
protein levels correspondingly changed the IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation levels but the reverse is not the case, the relative
contribution of IRS-1 protein down-regulation can be regarded as a
primary factor, and the dephosphorylation a secondary one. The
dephosphorylation and the down-regulation of IRS-1 also may be
unseparable events in EMT.
Snail and slug are recognized as key EMT inducers for their
ability to repress the E-cadherin transcription. Our study showed
for the first time that IRS-1 can repress snail and slug gene

transcription to suppress EMT. As an adaptor protein, IRS-1
probably cannot bind directly to snail and slug gene promoters; it
may function indirectly by unknown mechanism to regulate the
expression of these genes.
The role of IRS-1 in tumor formation and progression has been a
focus in the research field of IRS-1. It has been reported that the
IRS-1 protein levels are increased in some tumors, and IRS-1 was
phosphorylated and constitutively active in some tumors (33). The
findings that knockdown of IRS-1 induced spontaneously the EMT
and overexpression of IRS-1 blocked TGF-h1–induced EMT in A549
cells (human lung cancer cell line) also support the hypothesis that
IRS-1 may functions as a suppressor for tumor metastasis.
