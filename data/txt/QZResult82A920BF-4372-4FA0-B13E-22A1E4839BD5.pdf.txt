ABSTRACT
Patients with glioblastoma have one of the lowest overall survival rates among
patients with cancer. Standard of care for patients with glioblastoma includes
temozolomide and radiation therapy, yet 30% of patients do not respond to these
treatments and nearly all glioblastoma tumors become resistant. Chlorpromazine is
a United States Food and Drug Administration-approved phenothiazine widely used
as a psychotropic in clinical practice. Recently, experimental evidence revealed the
anti-proliferative activity of chlorpromazine against colon and brain tumors. Here, we
used chemoresistant patient-derived glioma stem cells and chemoresistant human
glioma cell lines to investigate the effects of chlorpromazine against chemoresistant
glioma. Chlorpromazine selectively and significantly inhibited proliferation in
chemoresistant glioma cells and glioma stem cells. Mechanistically, chlorpromazine
inhibited cytochrome c oxidase (CcO, complex IV) activity from chemoresistant but
not chemosensitive cells, without affecting other mitochondrial complexes. Notably,
our previous studies revealed that the switch to chemoresistance in glioma cells is
accompanied by a switch from the expression of CcO subunit 4 isoform 2 (COX4-2) to
COX4-1. In this study, chlorpromazine induced cell cycle arrest selectively in glioma
cells expressing COX4-1, and computer-simulated docking studies indicated that
chlorpromazine binds more tightly to CcO expressing COX4-1 than to CcO expressing
COX4-2. In orthotopic mouse brain tumor models, chlorpromazine treatment
significantly increased the median overall survival of mice harboring chemoresistant
tumors. These data indicate that chlorpromazine selectively inhibits the growth and
proliferation of chemoresistant glioma cells expressing COX4-1. The feasibility of
repositioning chlorpromazine for selectively treating chemoresistant glioma tumors
should be further explored.

INTRODUCTION

the most challenging barrier in the successful treatment
of cancer and is the principal reason for chemotherapy
failure and one of the main reasons underlying the failure
to demonstrate a sustainable beneficial clinical outcome
for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) [1, 2].
Differentiated bulk tumor cells commonly use less
efficient glycolysis for the production of ATP (Warburg
effect) [3]. However, tumors also contain cancer stem cells
(CSCs), a subset of cancer cells that have the ability to

Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent that
has shown significant initial benefit in the treatment
of high-grade gliomas, especially when combined
with radiotherapy, is commonly used in the adjunctive
treatment of gliomas. However, TMZ chemotherapy
eventually becomes impaired by the development of
chemoresistance. Indeed, this phenomenon presents

repopulate the entire tumor and thus lead to recurrence.
Distinct metabolic phenotypes have been described for
CSCs, depending on the cancer type [4]. The concept
of glycolysis-driven CSCs has been demonstrated in
breast cancer [5], nasopharyngeal carcinoma [6], and
hepatocellular carcinoma [7]. Conversely, CSCs driven
by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)
have been identified in lung cancer [8, 9], glioma [10–12],
pancreatic cancer [13], and leukemia stem cells [14].
Regardless of the primary metabolic phenotype, however,
mitochondrial function appears to be critical for CSC
functionality, and elimination of highly chemoresistant
CSCs via inhibition of mitochondrial function may
prevent relapse from disease and thus improve patients’
long-term outcome [4].
Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the terminal enzyme
of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (electron transport
chain, ETC) that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from
cytochrome c (cyt c) to oxygen (O2). Mammalian CcO
is a complex enzyme that comprises three mitochondrial
DNA-encoded subunits that perform the catalytic function
and 10 nuclear-encoded subunits that regulate the catalytic
activity [15, 16]. CcO activity governs the electron flux
capacity of the ETC, thus controlling the efficiency of
mitochondrial coupling and thereby the production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) [12, 17–19].
Several studies have focused on the biological
functions of CcO subunits in the development of tumors.
Chen et al. reported that knockdown of CcO subunit 5a
(COX5a) expression substantially suppresses the migration
and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer cells through
inhibition of metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 [20].
Moreover, elevated COX5a expression is associated with
higher N stage (a parameter that indicates cancer spread to
the nearby lymph nodes) and poorer prognosis of patients
with lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, COX5b is
involved in the metastatic potential of colorectal carcinoma
cells [21]. Notably, CcO subunit isoform expression can
vary by tissue and developmental stage [22] and may also
regulate CcO activity. In GBM, increased CcO activity
and increased expression of CcO subunit 4 isoform 1
(COX4-1) have been associated with acquisition of TMZ
chemoresistance [12] as well as shorter progression-free and
overall survival of patients [23].
COX4 performs an essential regulatory role in CcO
by binding ATP (allosteric inhibitor) and ADP (allosteric
activator), thereby adjusting energy production to energy
demand [24–27]. These alterations are likely to facilitate
adaptive chemoresistance through the suppression of
apoptotic signaling [28]. Indeed, inhibition of CcO
activity or decreased expression of COX4-1 reverses
chemoresistance to TMZ [12, 17], supporting a close
correlation between acquired chemoresistance and
changes in cellular metabolic machinery at the level of
the mitochondrion. Thus, a mechanism to therapeutically
target CcO activity may provide substantial benefit to
patients with GBM.

Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is one of the oldest drugs
developed as an antipsychotic agent [29–31], but
interest in this drug has been revived as the anti-cancer
activity of CPZ has been demonstrated experimentally
in many cancers, including glioma [32–38]. However,
the specificity of CPZ as an agent against chemoresistant
glioma has never been tested. Remarkably, it was
reported ˃ 50 years ago that CPZ affects mitochondrial
function by blocking CcO activity [39, 40], but the
therapeutic relevance of mitochondrial activity, and thus
of this finding, was not apparent at the time. Therefore, the
mechanisms by which CPZ blocks CcO activity as well as
the therapeutic potential of this effect remain unknown. To
obtain insight into the action of CPZ in the regulation of
CcO and the anti-glioma properties of CPZ against TMZresistant cells, we analyzed CcO activity, cell cycle control,
and long-term clonogenic survival in glioma cells after
CPZ treatment. We found that CPZ specifically inhibits
CcO activity in chemoresistant glioma cells, including
glioma stem cells (GSCs) derived from patient xenolines.

RESULTS
CPZ inhibits proliferation in chemoresistant
glioma and GSCs
Because we hypothesized that CPZ has an antiproliferative effect on chemoresistant glioma, the effect
of CPZ on cell survival and growth was examined.
We first used the TMZ-sensitive human glioma cell
line U251 and a U251-derived TMZ-resistant cell line
(UTMZ) previously described [11]. Treatment with CPZ
induced inhibition of cell proliferation in UTMZ cells
with an IC50 of 13.12 ±  2.8 µM. In contrast, CPZ did
not affect cell proliferation of TMZ-sensitive U251 cells
at concentrations up to 30 µM and with treatment times
up to 96 h (Figure 1A). CPZ also significantly inhibited
anchorage-independent growth of UTMZ cells (p < 0.001)
in soft agar growth assays (Figure 1B). Because CPZ
blocked cell proliferation specifically in chemoresistant
glioma cells, we investigated whether CPZ blocks cell
proliferation in the proportion of TMZ-resistant cells that
have GSC properties. As illustrated in Figure 1C, when
cultured in serum-free culture medium supplemented
with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF), TMZ-resistant UTMZ cells formed
neurospheres ranging from 0.1 to 1 mm in diameter.
However, when UTMZ cells were cultured in the presence
of CPZ, smaller and fewer neurospheres developed,
ranging from 2.5 to 10 µm in diameter. When cells were
plated in an in vitro limiting dilution assay, CPZ also
inhibited the formation of tumor neurospheres in a dosedependent manner (Figure 1D).

CPZ inhibits CcO activity
CPZ has been reported to target mitochondrial
function [39, 40], thus we tested whether CPZ targets

the mitochondrial ETC complexes. The activities of
complexes I, II–III, IV (CcO) and V (ATP synthase)
were measured in mitochondrial extracts from TMZsensitive U251 and TMZ-resistant UTMZ cells in the
presence of differing CPZ concentrations (Figure 2).
Although CPZ did not affect complexes I, II–III, or
V (Figure  2A,  2B  and  2D), it significantly decreased
CcO activity in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2C)

specifically in UTMZ cells. We next investigated the
kinetic mechanism of CPZ inhibition of CcO. CPZ
lowered the Vmax (870 ± 57 to 375 ± 24 pmol/sec/mg) but
not the Km for cyt c. Figure 2E shows the representative
Michaelis-Menten graph, and Figure 2F shows the
representative Lineweaver–Burk double-reciprocal plots
indicating a non-competitive inhibition of cyt c, with a
50% decrease in Vmax at 2 μM CPZ.

Because we previously demonstrated that the
expression of COX4-1, rather than COX4-2, is in part
responsible for the expansion of GSCs [11], the cells
implicated in tumor recurrence and resistance to therapy in
patients with glioblastoma, we tested the effect of CPZ in
U251 glioma cells transfected with FLAG-epitope-tagged
COX4-1 (U251-TgCOX4-1) or FLAG-epitope-tagged
COX4-2 (U251-TgCOX4-2). U251 cells express the
COX4-2 isoform, thus the vectors were transfected into
U251 cells stably depleted of endogenous COX4-2 [11].
As illustrated in Figure 3, CPZ inhibited CcO activity
and decreased the proliferation of cells that expressed the
COX4-1 isoform, with an IC50 of 1.04 μM (Figure 3B).
To provide evidence that cell treatment with CPZ
inhibits O2 consumption, we investigated the cellular
bioenergetic response to CPZ by high-resolution
respirometry. A comparison of different parameters
in COX4-1– and COX4-2–expressing glioma cells is
provided in Figure 3. Under basal conditions, CPZ-

treated COX4-1 glioma cells had markedly lower basal
mitochondrial respiration than untreated COX4-1–
expressing cells had (Figure 3C, 3D). This mitochondrial
respiration is composed of two components: the
O2  consumption related to ATP synthesis and the
O2 consumption due to the proton leak across the inner
mitochondrial membrane. The addition of oligomycin,
an ATP synthase inhibitor, allowed the differentiation
of these two parameters. While there was no significant
difference in proton leak, the ATP-linked respiration was
significantly reduced in COX4-1 cells pretreated with
CPZ (Figure 3C, 3D). The addition of the uncoupler
FCCP allowed the determination of the potential maximal
respiratory capacity of the cells. COX4-1–expressing cells
pretreated with CPZ had a markedly lower maximum
respiratory rate than untreated COX4-1-expressing cells
had (Figure 3C, 3D). Compared with COX4-1–expressing
glioma cells, COX4-2–expressing glioma cells have
a reduced respiratory capacity. Notably, CPZ did not

induce significant differences in basal, ATP-linked, or
maximal respiration in glioma cells expressing COX4-2,
suggesting that the lack of COX4-1 isoform makes the
cells insensitive to CPZ (data not shown).
When cells overexpressing COX4-1 were plated
in an in vitro limiting dilution assay, CPZ inhibited the
formation of tumor neurospheres and the frequency
of self-renewing cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3E, 3F). The detection of CPZ-mediated inhibition
of CcO activity only when the COX4-1 subunit was
expressed suggests that COX4 isoform-specific differences
in CcO structure may control the effects of CPZ on CcO.
We next investigated the effect of CPZ on
mitochondrial extracts from GSCs derived from J × 12 and
J × 39 human tissue. Western blot analysis of the COX4
subunits showed that both human GSC types expressed

significantly higher levels of COX4-1 than of COX4-2
(Figure 4A and 4B). CPZ also decreased CcO activity
in GSCs derived from both J × 12 and J × 39 xenolines
(Figure 4C and 4D). Similarly, CPZ significantly
decreased the stem cell frequency and the frequency of
self-renewing cells in a dose-dependent manner in both
xenolines (Figure 4E and 4F).

CPZ induces cell cycle arrest in TMZ-resistant
glioma cells
To evaluate the inhibitory effect of CPZ on cell
proliferation, we measured cell-cycle progression using
flow cytometry. TMZ-sensitive U251 and TMZ-resistant
UTMZ cells were treated with 10 or 20 μM of CPZ, and
the percentage of cells in each stage of the cell cycle

was determined 24 h after treatment, as described in the
materials and methods section.
In agreement with the results of the proliferation
studies (Figure 1A), CPZ treatment of U251 cells did not
affect the percentage of cells in the G1 phase (Figure 5A).
However, CPZ treatment of UTMZ cells led to G1 phase
accumulation that reached 70.4% (p < 0.0001) and 73.1%
(p = 0.0028) after treatment with 10 and 20  μM CPZ,
respectively, whereas only 52.6% of control vehicle-treated
UTMZ cells were in G1 (Figure 5B). Concomitantly,
12.1% of UTMZ cells in the 20 μM CPZ group were in
the S phase fraction compared with 22.7% of the cells in
the control group. Similarly, 12.2% of UTMZ cells in the

20 μM CPZ group were in the G2/M fraction compared
with 23.6% of cells in the control group. These results
indicate that CPZ causes inhibition of cell proliferation in
TMZ-resistant cells by G1 cell cycle arrest.
Because CPZ blocks CcO activity and cell
proliferation when COX4-1 is expressed, we next
compared the effect of CPZ on cell cycle progression
in glioma cells transfected with COX4-1 (U251TgCOX4-1) or with COX4-2 (U251-TgCOX4-2). As
shown in Figure  5C and 5D, CPZ triggered cell cycle
arrest only when cells expressed COX4-1. Indeed, the
percentage of glioma cells transfected with TgCOX4-1
accumulated in the G1 phase increased from 52.8% in

than the levels of COX4-2 (Figure 7B). In contrast, the
TMZ-sensitive cell line (U251) expressed mostly the
COX4-2 isoform. After tumor inoculation, the mice
were randomly allocated into three groups of 10  mice
each and treated with saline or CPZ at 5 or 7 mg/kg,
injected intraperitoneally three times a week for 2 weeks
and 5 days after tumor implantation. Median survival of
mice was 18.5 days in the saline group and increased to
22.5 days in the 5 mg/kg CPZ group (p = 0.01) and 25.0
days in the 7 mg/kg CPZ group (p = 0.0007) (Figure 7C).
In contrast, CPZ treatment of mice bearing U251 glioma
cells provided no benefit in median survival as determined
by log-rank test (Figure 7D). No differences in behavior
or weight were observed between saline-treated and CPZtreated mice (data not shown).

CPZ inhibits CcO activity from bovine heart
Because CPZ was tested using mitochondrial
extracts from glioma cells, we assessed the possibility
that the resulting CcO inhibition was an indirect effect
due to binding to other mitochondrial components by
evaluating the effect of CPZ on CcO purified from bovine
heart. When evaluated by SDS-PAGE, the purified CcO
enzymes produced multiple bands of apparent molecular
mass ranging from 12 to 45 kDa (Figure 6A). Western blot
analysis demonstrated that COX4-1 was the most abundant
COX4 isoform expressed (Figure 6B), with expression
levels about 20-fold higher than the levels of COX4-2
(Figure 6C). CPZ significantly decreased the activity of
purified CcO in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6D),
with an IC50 of 25.82 ± 3.75 µM (Figure 6E). These results
demonstrate a direct interaction of CPZ with CcO.

CPZ likely binds to a hydrophobic pocket
formed by COX4 and COX1
To explore the potential mechanism of CPZ/CcO
binding, we constructed human CcO homology models
and conducted structural analysis and molecular docking
studies. CcO is a large protein complex with 13 different
subunits (Figure 8A). Homology models of human CcO
were built based on a crystal structure of mouse CcO.
The residues in the mouse CcO COX4 subunit are 82%
identical to and 96% homologous to the residues of human
COX4-1 and 46% identical to and 64% homologous to
the residues in human COX4-2. As a comparison, the
residues in human COX4-1 are 45% identical to and 58%
homologous to residues in human COX4-2. Modeling

CPZ prolongs the survival time of mice bearing
TMZ-resistant glioma cells
To study whether CPZ is effective in an orthotopic
mouse models, we stereotactically injected TMZ-sensitive
U251 and TMZ-resistant UTMZ tumor cells into the right
caudate/putamen of nude mice. Western blot analysis
demonstrated that COX4-1 was the most abundant COX4
isoform expressed in the TMZ-resistant cell line (UTMZ)
(Figure 7A), with expression levels about 10-fold higher

showed that the COX4 subunit adopts a structure with
a long helical middle fragment and two partly folded
but mostly unstructured terminal ends (Figure 8B). Our
structural mapping analysis indicated that the COX4 alone
does not provide proper sites for ligand binding, but the
CcO complex contains several potential binding sites
that involve COX4 residues. Analysis of CPZ docking
revealed one site as the most likely binding site for CPZ
(Figure 8A and 8B). This identified site, which we named
siteA, is mainly a hydrophobic pocket and is formed by
residues from the central helical region of COX4 and two
other transmembrane helices of COX1 that are close to
the HEME binding site. SiteA has an excellent SiteScore
of 0.92 (a SiteScore value of 0.80 has been found to
accurately distinguish between drug-binding and nondrug-binding sites [41]) and consists of residues that differ
between COX4-1 and COX4-2, including Leu129/Lys131,
Lys122/Arg124, Met119/Trp121, and Tyr126/Phe128 from
COX4-1/COX4-2, respectively. The docked CPZ-COX4-1
model score (-6.0 kcal/mol) was significantly better than
the score of the docked CPZ-COX4-2 model (-5.3 kcal/
mol), suggesting CPZ binds more tightly to CcO with
COX4-1 than to CcO with COX4-2. Such a result can
be well explained by the different residues at siteA. The
hydrophobic Leu129 makes the siteA of COX4-1 a partly
closed pocket that is a more comfortable environment for
CPZ binding; as a result, CPZ is able to form an H-bond
with Lys122 and π-π stacking interaction with the phenol
ring of Tyr126 (Figure 8C). In contrast, the highly polar
Lys131 of COX4-2 opens up the siteA, which makes
the mainly hydrophobic CPZ molecule move toward
the inner part of the pocket, and the relatively smaller
sidechain of Phe128 (compared with Tyr126 of COX4-1)
further permits such a movement. Additionally, the flat
amide end of Arg124 (compared with Lys122 of COX4-1)
impedes the formation of the H-bond, thus both the
H-bond and the π-π stacking interaction are lost in the
docked COX4-2 model (Figure 8D). Interestingly, in the
CcO complex, COX11 locates very close to siteA, and
in the docked COX4-1 model, the dimethylamine end of
CPZ overlapped with residues of COX11 (Figure 8E).
Therefore, CPZ binding would likely generate a steric
hindrance that blocks the interactions between COX11 and
the rest of the CcO complex, while the deeply buried CPZ
identified in the COX4-2 model would not have such an
effect (Figure 8E).

Furthermore, we reported that a subclass of glioma cells
that utilize glycolysis preferentially can also switch from
aerobic glycolysis to OxPhos under limiting glucose
conditions, as has been observed in cervical cancer cells,
breast carcinoma cells, hepatoma cells, and pancreatic
cancer cells as well [45–47]. Furthermore, a recent study
demonstrated that mitochondrial ROS promote glioma
progression [48]. Thus, targeting mitochondria could
provide therapeutic opportunities.
In a retrospective clinical trial in patients with newly
diagnosed primary GBM, we identified a subset of patients
(25–30% of the study population) with an extremely
low overall survival (6 months) and high resistance to
therapy [23]. Tumors in this population are characterized
by less heterogeneity, OxPhos-dependent metabolism,
elevated CcO activity, and enrichment in GSCs. Similar
results from another research group identified patients with
GBM characterized by low overall survival and tumors
with upregulated expression levels of metabolic enzymes,
including CcO [49]. We have also demonstrated that during
tumor regrowth (recurrence), a switch from glycolytic
to OxPhos metabolism may occur with a concomitant
increase of CcO activity [12, 17]. Additionally, we showed
that genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of CcO activity
suppresses tumor growth and depletes GSCs in gliomas,
providing a strategic opportunity to improve therapeutic
outcomes in patients with GBM [12, 17, 50]. With respect
to this concept, we recently identified and characterized
a novel small molecule inhibitor of CcO (ADDA 5) [50].
ADDA 5 inhibits the proliferation of glioma cells, without
toxicity against non-cancer cells, and treatment with
ADDA 5 significantly inhibits tumor growth in flank
xenograft mouse models. Importantly, ADDA 5 inhibits
CcO activity and blocks cell proliferation and neurosphere
formation of GSCs [50].
However, while ADDA 5 is a promising compound
for the treatment of GBM, clinical translation of this
compound may take years. The repositioning of existing
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs can
bypass or shorten critical steps of drug development, such
as chemical optimization and toxicology testing, thereby
resulting in a shorter time frame for clinical translation and
patient benefits. We propose that FDA-approved agents
that cross the blood brain barrier, such as CPZ, can be
repurposed for use in the treatment of chemoresistant GBM.
Although CPZ-mediated blockade of CcO activity
was described ˃ 50 years ago [39], the effects of CPZ on
mitochondrial ETC complexes specifically in glioma cells
were not examined. Our study of these effects revealed
that CPZ does not affect complexes I, II–III, or V. Notably,
CPZ did significantly decrease CcO activity, but only in
TMZ-resistant glioma cells. We previously showed that
acquisition of TMZ-resistance is associated with a switch
in the regulatory subunit of CcO such that the COX4-1
isoform, rather than the COX4-2 isoform, is mainly
expressed [12]. To determine if the expression of COX4-1

DISCUSSION
The Warburg effect, in which cells exhibit
increases in glucose uptake, glycolytic capacity, and
lactate production and the absence of respiration despite
a high oxygen concentration, is often detected in tumor
cells [3]. However, we and other groups have identified
several glioma cell lines that are highly dependent on the
mitochondrial OxPhos pathway to produce ATP [42–47].

underlies the specificity of CPZ for TMZ-resistant cells,
we compared the effects of CPZ on CcO from glioma
cells expressing COX4-1 and from cells expressing
COX4-2 [11]. CPZ inhibited CcO activity only when the
COX4-1 subunit was expressed, suggesting that the COX4
isoform-specific differences in CcO structure control the
interaction with CPZ.
Analysis of the mechanism of inhibition showed that
CPZ is a non-competitive inhibitor of CcO with respect
to the cyt c substrate, providing strong evidence that CPZ
binds to an allosteric site rather than to the active site of
cyt c. Of note, it was previously shown that CPZ blocks
CcO activity by a competitive mechanism that blocks
the interaction with cyt c [39, 40]. The discrepancy with
our results may be due to cell type-specific responses,
differences in normal and cancer cells, or variations in
experimental conditions. Specifically, the results reported
by Dawkins et al. [39] reflect the effect of CPZ on the
activity of CcO from normal liver mitochondria, whereas
our study characterized the effect of CPZ on CcO from
human brain cancer cells. Furthermore, the concentrations
of CPZ which they found necessary to inhibit CcO activity
were significantly higher than the one reported here

(150–200 µM vs 10–30 µM), which may be a consequence
of the high concentrations of cyt c tested in their system
(30–200 µM).
Our computer modeling studies suggested that
CPZ binds to a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues
from the central helical region of COX4 and two other
transmembrane helices of COX1 that are close to the
HEME binding site. Our docking studies also suggested
that CPZ binds more favorably to CcO with COX4-1
than with COX4-2, and may affect CcO function through
direct interactions with COX1 residues that are close to the
HEME center, by preventing the recruitment of COX11, or
through a combination of these mechanisms.
In vitro, CPZ inhibited cell proliferation and
anchorage-independent growth in chemoresistant but
not chemosensitive glioma cells. CPZ also inhibited cell
proliferation of GSCs. These data suggest that CPZ would
be effective in minimizing recurrence that may result from
the proliferation and differentiation of GSCs.
Our results showed that the growth inhibition
is achieved at a concentration of CPZ between 1 and
15 µM. Since we evaluated different cellular processes

MATERIALS AND METHODS

cell  growth), it is absolutely possible that both
processes are differentially affected by CPZ. Indeed, the
concentration necessary to block CcO activity in vitro is
significantly higher (IC50 = 30 µM). It is possible that the
mitochondrial membrane potential can increase uptake
and/or prolong retention of CPZ within the mitochondria,
reducing the IC50 in intact cells.
Notably, CPZ treatment substantially increased the
survival of mice bearing intracranial TMZ-resistant glioma
cells, without any noticeable adverse effects such as
change in animal weight or behavior, implying a potential
therapeutic application for CPZ.
CcO is widely expressed in mitochondria of
eukaryotes, which raises concern about systemic
inhibition of CcO. However, mitochondria have emerged
recently as effective targets for novel anti-cancer
drugs with high specificity for cancer cells [50–63].
Indeed, we have identified the molecular mechanisms
that permit the malignant cell-selectivity of inhibitors
of CcO. Normal mammalian cells have a relatively
large excess (3- to 10-fold) of CcO activity compared
with that in primary and recurrent GBM [64–69].
In normal brain cells, therefore, the CcO activity could
be decreased by approximately 70% before major
changes in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis
occur [64, 65], whereas a 7–22% decrease in CcO
activity is sufficient to promote the alteration of energy
homeostasis in malignant cells [12, 69]. Thus, the higher
CcO activity and threshold in respiration in normal cells
offers a window for the therapeutic use of CcO-specific
inhibitors, since the doses necessary to effectively
decrease CcO activity in malignant cells should not
affect the overall capability of CcO to maintain energy
homeostasis in normal cells.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that CPZ blocks
proliferation of chemoresistant gliomas. Interestingly,
cell cycle analyses showed that the decreased
proliferative activity is due to cell cycle arrest, rather
than increased apoptosis. Indeed, we detected few
apoptotic cells and the number did not significantly
increase throughout CPZ treatment (data not shown).
CPZ has also been shown to inhibit cell-cycle
progression in rat glioma C6 cells by inducing p21Waf/
Cip1/Egr1 expression [36] and to induce autophagic cell
death by inhibiting the AKT/mTOR pathway in human
glioma U87-MG cells [37]. In addition, CPZ enhanced
therapeutic efficacy in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer
cells [38] and in colorectal cancer [34], suggesting this
drug as a potential agent for improving the efficacy of
cancer chemotherapy.
In conclusion, our study provides new insight
into the repositioning of CPZ for the treatment of
chemoresistant gliomas. Future studies should investigate
the potential interactions between CPZ and other
conventional anti-GBM therapies.

Cell culture
TMZ-sensitive U251 cells and TMZ-resistant cells
derived from U251 cells (UTMZ) were grown in DMEM
F-12 medium plus l-glutamine supplemented with 7%
heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin as we
previously described [11, 12, 17, 42, 50, 55, 70, 71]. The
resistant cell line was obtained by progressive adaptation
of the parental sensitive cells (U251) to increasing
concentrations of TMZ [12]. FLAG-epitope-tagged
COX4-2 and COX4-1 were generated and transfected into
U251 cells stably depleted of the endogenously expressed
COX4-2, as previously described [11].
Cell lines are grown continuously up to 10 passages,
and then we start a new culture from frozen seed
stocks. Cell lines are regularly tested for mycoplasma
contamination using the Universal Mycoplasma Detection
kit (ATCC® 30-1012KTM) and authenticated by the ATCC
authentication service utilizing short tandem repeat (STR)
profiling.

Cell proliferation assay
For cell proliferation, glioma cells were seeded into
24-well plates (3 × 104 cells/well), and cell number was
counted every 24 h for 4 days as previously described [11].

Soft agar growth assay
A bottom layer of 0.4% agarose and DMEM/
F12 with 10% FBS was poured and allowed to solidify.
Additional agarose was allowed to reach 42°C and then
7.5 × 103 tumor cells were added to the agarose/media
solution and poured onto the bottom layer. Appropriate
concentrations of CPZ were added to both agarose/
media layers. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 4 weeks
to form colonies, followed by staining with 0.005%
crystal violet. The colonies were imaged and quantified
using the Gel Dock imager and Quantity One software
(BioRad).

In vitro limiting dilution assay
In vitro dilution assays were performed as
previously described [11]. Briefly, single-cell suspensions
were plated at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 cells per well in
96-well plates in neurobasal medium containing EGF and
FGF. Ten days after plating, the number of neurospheres
in each well and the percentage of positive wells were
quantified by manual counting. Extreme limiting dilution
assay analyses were performed on the data as previously
described [11, 44, 45].

sucrose buffer (MSB; 0.525 mM mannitol, 175 mM
sucrose, 12.5 mM EDTA, 12.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and
centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris.
The supernatant was further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for
20 min. The mitochondrial pellets were then digested with
DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 30 min to digest
nuclear DNA. After digestion, the mitochondrial pellets
were washed three times with MSB, deep-frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at −80°C.
Mitochondrial complex activities and kinetic
parameters for CcO activity were determined as previously
described [50]. Purified CcO from bovine heart was
acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog # C5499, lot #
036M4111V). The purity and the identity of each band
was confirmed by MS-based analysis [50, 77].

The establishment and maintenance of the Mayo
GBM xenograft lines J × 12 and J × 39 has been described
[12, 17, 72–76]. J × 12 and J × 39 are classical subtype
patient-derived GBM xenograft cell lines (xenolines) that
were established in immunocompromised athymic nude
mice from surgical resection waste specimens obtained
from consented patients undergoing surgical therapy for
primary GBM. All animal studies were approved by the
UAB Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Intracranial tumors
All surgical and experimental procedures and animal
care were performed in accordance and compliance with
the policies approved by the University of Alabama
at Birmingham Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (APN 131209529) as we previously described
(11). Briefly, intracranial gliomas were generated using
3 × 105 U251 or UTMZ human glioma cells suspended in
5% methylcellulose in serum-free medium. The cells were
drawn into a 250-μl Hamilton gas-tight syringe mounted in
a Chaney repeating dispenser and fitted with a 30G ½-inch
needle with a calibrated depth of 2.5 mm from the middle
of the bevel opening. Under an operating microscope, the
fascia on the skull of the anesthetized mouse was scraped
off and a 0.5-mm burr hole was made 2 mm to the right
of the midline suture and 1 mm caudal to the coronal
suture. The syringe was inserted into a Kopf stereotactic
electrode clamp mounting bracket attached to an electrode
manipulator (David Kopf Instruments; Tujinga, CA)
mounted on a Kopf stereotactic frame electrode A-P
zeroing bar (#1450). Each mouse was positioned on the
stereotactic frame and the needle inserted to the depth
marker in the right cerebral hemisphere. Approximately
90–120 sec after injection of 5 μl, the needle was slowly
withdrawn over the next 1 min. The burr hole was plugged
with sterile bone wax and skin was closed with Tissumend
surgical adhesive (Stryker Orthopedics; Kalamazoo, MI).
The major endpoint in this study was animal survival;
moribund animals that became unresponsive to mild
external stimuli were euthanized and this date was used as
an estimate of the date of death.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as we
previously described (11, 12). The following antibodies
were used: anti-citrate synthase (1:1000 dilution, 161311-AP, ProteinTech Group, Chicago, IL); anti-COX4-1
(1:1000 dilution, ab14744, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and
anti-COX4-2 (1:1000 dilution, 11463-1-AP, ProteinTech
Group). Anti-COX4-1 and anti-COX4-2 antibodies were
tested for specificity, and no cross-reactivity between
isoforms was detected.

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed as we previously
described (45). Briefly, glioma cells were cultured in 6-well
plates and synchronized for 48 h in normal DMEM/F12
serum-free medium. After 48 h, serum-free medium was
replaced by DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 7%
serum with or without graded concentrations of CPZ for
24 h. Then, cells were collected and pellets resuspended in
70% cold ethanol for up to 18 h. Fixed cells were pelleted
by centrifugation and treated (20 min, room temperature)
with 100 U of DNase-free RNase A/106 cells. Nuclei were
stained with 500 µl of propidium iodide (20 µg/ml) before
nuclear DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry
using a BD Accuri™ C6 flow cytometer. All data were
acquired and analyzed using FlowJo software.

Structural model generation and molecular docking
studies were conducted using the programs of the
Schrödinger Suite 2015 (Schrödinger, LLC, New York,
NY, 2015). Based on the crystal structures of mouse
CcO (Protein Data Bank ID: 2Y69) [78], two human
CcO homology models were constructed for COX4-1
and COX4-2 using the Prime program. Potential ligand
binding sites were identified based on structural analysis
of the CcO models using the SiteMap program. The three-

Mitochondria were prepared according to Higuchi
and Linn (42). Briefly, cells were washed twice in PBS.
The pellet was resuspended in magnesium resuspension
buffer (MgRSB; 10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), incubated at 4°C for 10 min, and
then disrupted with a Dounce glass homogenizer. The

dimensional structure of CPZ was prepared using the
LigPrep program and the docking studies were conducted
with the Glide program. Specifically, the induced-fitdocking (IFD) protocol [79], which is capable of sampling
dramatic side-chain conformational changes as well as
minor changes in protein backbone structure, was applied
to explore the modes of CPZ binding at different binding
sites. Residues within 5 Å of the docked CPZ were
allowed to be flexible and the docked results were scored
using the extra-precision (XP) mode of Glide.
