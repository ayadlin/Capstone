Abstract:
Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) continues to have a poor patient prognosis
despite optimal standard of care. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have been implicated
as the presumed cause of tumor recurrence and resistance to therapy. With this
in mind, we screened a diverse chemical library of 2,000 compounds to identify
therapeutic agents that inhibit GSC proliferation and therefore have the potential
to extend patient survival. High-throughput screens (HTS) identified 78 compounds
that repeatedly inhibited cellular proliferation, of which 47 are clinically approved
for other indications and 31 are experimental drugs. Several compounds (such as
digitoxin, deguelin, patulin and phenethyl caffeate) exhibited high cytotoxicity,
with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) in the low nanomolar range. In
particular, the FDA approved drug for the treatment of alcoholism, disulfiram (DSF),
was significantly potent across multiple patient samples (IC50 of 31.1 nM). The activity
of DSF was potentiated by copper (Cu), which markedly increased GSC death. DSF–Cu
inhibited the chymotrypsin-like proteasomal activity in cultured GSCs, consistent with
inactivation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the subsequent induction of
tumor cell death. Given that DSF is a relatively non-toxic drug that can penetrate the
blood-brain barrier, we suggest that DSF should be tested (as either a monotherapy
or as an adjuvant) in pre-clinical models of human GBM. Data also support targeting of
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as a therapeutic approach in the treatment of GBM.

Introduction

to replicate (self-renewal) and generate all, or most, of the
diverse cell types found within the mature recurrent tumor.
The GSC population has been shown to be resistant to
standard therapy, either because of distinct biophysical and
genetic properties, or possibly due to migration outside of
the treatment field [4, 5]. Recent reports in the literature
support the importance of targeting cancer stem cells as an
additional strategy to improve overall response to cancer
therapy [6-10]. In GBM, targeting cancer stem cells as the
potential cause of tumor recurrence clearly represents an
opportunity to improve patient prognosis.
With this in mind, we performed high-throughput
chemical screens (HTS) to identify compounds with the
potential to prevent tumor recurrence by inhibiting GSC
proliferation. We screened the MicroSource Spectrum

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common
primary brain tumor in adults, remains an incurable and
rapidly fatal disease [1]. After primary therapy, consisting
of surgical resection followed by concurrent radiation and
chemotherapy, the average time to recurrence is only 9
months and once the tumor recurs, average survival is
limited to 6 months [2]. According to the hierarchical
model of tumorigenesis, the presumed cause of tumor
recurrence is the sub-population of tumor-initiating cells or
glioma stem cells (GSCs) that persist after primary therapy
[3]. Although the relationship between the GSC population
and bulk tumor remains controversial, accumulating
evidence supports the notion that GSCs have the ability

collection; a 2,000 compound library consisting of FDA
approved drugs, compounds that have reached late-phase
clinical trials, experimental drugs, and natural products.
This collection was selected based on the structural and
biological diversity it provides for HTS. Furthermore, the
identification of drug candidates that are already approved
for another indication should have a rapid route into the
clinic, whereas the identification of new agents provides
a much needed platform for drug development. Because
commercially available immortalized cancer cell lines do
not account for the genetic diversity between individual
patients or the cellular heterogeneity of the tumors from
which they are derived, we used patient-specific cell
cultures for HTS which contain heterogeneous tumor
cell populations and, more importantly, preserve the GSC
phenotype [11]. The inherent heterogeneity of GBM
is reflected in GSCs, which differ in their proliferative
potential, tumor-initiating ability and therapeutic
responses, and more closely resemble the parent tumor
both genotypically and phenotypically [12].
We report the half maximal inhibitory concentrations
(IC50) for several drug candidates with the potential to
inhibit GSC proliferation. From these we have identified
disulfiram (tetraethylthiuram disulfide, Antabuse®, DSF),
a clinically approved drug for the treatment of alcoholism
[13], as a potent inhibitor of multiple patient-derived
GSCs. We demonstrate that the anti-tumor effects of DSF
are a result of proteasome inhibition and the subsequent
induction of tumor cell death. In addition, we show that
DSF activity is dependent on the presence of copper ions
(Cu), consistent with the formation of a thiocarbamatecopper complex that functions as a proteasome inhibitor.
Accumulating evidence suggests that proteasomal activity
contributes to tumorigenesis by promoting tumor cell
proliferation, down regulating apoptosis, and increasing
angiogenesis. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is
therefore considered an important target in cancer
therapy [14]. Combined with the fact that proteasome
inhibitors are emerging as promising therapeutic agents
against glioma [15], treatment with a relatively nontoxic
proteasome inhibitor such as DSF could be an attractive
approach to test in clinical trials for GBM patients.

Institute research steering committee. All participants
provided written informed consent according to IRB
guidelines prior to participation in this study.

Patient samples and cell lines
Tumors were obtained from surgeries performed
at Swedish Medical Center (Seattle, WA) according to
institutional guidelines. Patient samples used in this
study were diagnosed as WHO grade IV glioblastoma
multiforme (Table S1).
GSC cultures were established from freshly resected
tumor tissues and maintained in NeuroCult® NSA
medium (Stem Cell Technologies) with B-27 serum-free
supplement (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth
factor (EGF) and 20 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor
(FGF-2) as described [11]. In brief, tissue samples were
minced into 1 mm3 fragments and digested with Accutase
(Sigma) at 37 oC for 15-20 minutes. NSA medium was
added to quench Accutase activity and cell suspensions
were passed through 70 µm nylon mesh. The suspensions
were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes, resuspended
in fresh NSA, and plated into T75 flasks pre-coated with
laminin (1:100 in PBS; Sigma). To evaluate neurosphere
formation ability of GSCs (Figure S1), single cell
suspensions were plated directly into ultra low attachment
dishes (Corning) and maintained in NSA medium.
Human neural stem cells (NSCs) and G144 GSCs
were obtained from Celprogen (San Pedro, CA) and
the BioRep Cell Repository (Milan, Italy), respectively.
SKBR3 cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and grown in McCoy’s
5A medium with 10% FBS. Commerically available cell
lines were authenticated by the corresponding vendor by
Short Tandem Repeat (STR) and used within six months.
GSCs have not been authenticated due to lack of reference
STR. With the exception of G144 (which was provided by
the vendor at passage 22), cells were used at ≤ passage 5.
Bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCPS), copper
(II) sulfate (CuSO4), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
tetraethylthiuram disulfide (disulfiram, DSF) were
purchased from Sigma. Zinc gluconate was from MP

investigating the effect of metal ions on cell viability,
GSCs were treated with DSF combined with either copper
sulfate or zinc gluconate (at a 1:1 molar ratio). Prior to
taking proliferation measurements, ToxCount reagents
were incubated with GSCs for 30 minutes at 37 oC. The
conversion of calcein AM to green fluorescent calcein in
viable cells was measured using the IsoCyte (BlueShift
Biotechnologies) with a 510/540 nm band pass filter.
Percentage cell viability is reported as the mean and SD
(of six replicate measurements) relative to DMSO control.

CD44, GFAP, TUJ-1 and O4 (1:50) were from R&D
Systems. Goat secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa
dyes (1:500) were from Invitrogen. DAPI (Sigma) was
used as the nuclear counterstain, and images were acquired
using a Nikon Ti-U inverted fluorescence microscope
liked to a DS-U2 camera.

Compound library
The library used was the MicroSource Spectrum
collection (MicroSource Discovery Inc.). A library of
2,000 compounds composed primarily of FDA approved
compounds (50%), natural products (30%), and other
bioactive components (20%). The compounds were
supplied by the vendor as 10 mM solutions in DMSO at
> 95% purity.

Proteasomal chymotrypsin-like activity assays
The chymotrypsin (CT)-like activity was
measured in GSCs using Proteasome-Glo assays per
the manufacturer’s recommendations (Promega). GSCs
were plated in laminin coated 96-well plates at a density
of 2,000 cells per well, allowed to attach overnight, and
treated with DMSO, DSF or DSF–Cu (1 or 10 µM),
for 96 hours at 37oC. After incubation, Proteasome-Glo
Reagent containing the proteasome substrate for CTlike activity (Succinyl-leucine-leucine-valine-tyrosineaminoluciferin) was added to each well. Plates were mixed
on an orbital shaker for 2 minutes and then incubated at
room temperature for 15 minutes. Luminescence was
read on a Perkin Elmer EnVision and measurements were
corrected for background luminescence. Percentage (CT)like proteasomal activity is reported as the mean and SD
(of six replicate measurements) relative to DMSO control.

High-throughput chemical screens with GSCs
Cells were added to laminin coated 384-well plates
at a density of 800 cells per well using a Thermo Scientific
Matrix WellMate, and incubated overnight to allow
attachment. Compounds were added (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10
µM) to GSCs using the CyBi-Well vario and incubated at
37 oC for 96 hours. CellTiter-Glo (Promega) was added
to individual wells and, following 20 minutes incubation
on an orbital shaker, luminescence was measured on
a Perkin Elmer EnVision. HTS was performed on five
patient-derived cultures (SN143, SN175, SN179, SN186
and G144) in duplicate. Measurements were corrected
for background luminescence. Percentage cell viability is
reported as the mean and standard deviation (SD) relative
to DMSO control.

Aldefluor analysis and flow cytometry
Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity
was determined using the Aldefluor assay per the
manufacturer’s instructions (Stem Cell Technologies).
Cells (1 x 106) were treated with either DMSO or DSF–
Cu (1 µM for 24 hours) and resuspended in Aldefluor
assay buffer containing the ALDH substrate, bodipyaminoacetaldehyde (BAAA; 5 µM), for 45 minutes at 37
o
C. As a negative control for each treatment condition, cells
were incubated with 15 µM diethylaminobenzaldehyde
(DEAB), a specific ALDH inhibitor. Fluorescence
activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed using a BD
Influx. Aldefluor fluorescence was excited at 488 nm
and emission was detected using a standard fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) 530/40 nm band-pass filter. The
ALDH+ population was determined relative to the
corresponding DEAB treated control. Data was acquired
using Spigot 6.1.4 and analyzed with FlowJo 7.6.5.

Dose response curves and IC50 calculations
The potency of active compounds was quantified
by generating 8-point dose response curves. Experimental
conditions were identical to those described for the initial
screen. Dose response data were also obtained for NSCs,
for the comparison of drug potency on normal versus
malignant cells. Test compounds were added to cell
lines at concentrations ranging from 0.005 – 10 µM. IC50
values were calculated by fitting data to the standard fourparameter sigmoidal dose response curve. Curve fitting
was performed with GraFit software.

ToxCount cell viability assays
Cell viability was measured using ToxCount
assays per the manufacturer’s recommendations (Active
Motif). GSCs were plated in laminin coated 96-well
plates at a density of 2,000 cells per well, allowed to
attach overnight, and treated with either DMSO or

were cytotoxic at 10 µM, cell viability was 100% at the
lower concentration range (0.1 – 1 µM) indicating a
lack of concentration dependence. The remaining 133
compounds (6.6%) showed some cytotoxicity at both
1 and 10 µM. From these positive hits, 78 compounds
repeatedly inhibited GSC growth across the five samples
tested (Table S2). The remaining 55 compounds were
not common inhibitors but did inhibit the proliferation of
specific patient-derived GSCs (Table S3). The compounds
identified represent multiple classes of drugs and natural
products, including antineoplastics, cardiotonics,
antihelminthics, and others, as indicated in Table 1. The
total number of active agents, for each class of drug per
GSC line, was determined (Table 1). The common GSC
inhibitors were further evaluated for potency.

Animal work was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at The
University of Florida. To verify tumor initiating ability,
non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient
(NOD/SCID) female mice 8-10 weeks of age were
anesthetized and received a flank subcutaneous injection
of GSCs (1 x 106) in 200 µl of medium and 100 µl of
Matrigel (BD). The animals were divided into equal
groups based on receipt of GSC line (n = 5), monitored for
tumor growth, and euthanized once tumors reached ~2000
mm3 in size. Tumor volume is reported as the mean and
standard error of the mean (SEM).

Results

Half maximal inhibitory concentrations
inhibitors of GSC proliferation

Initial characterization of patient-derived GSC
cultures

Dose response curves were generated for
compounds identified from the initial screen to determine
the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for
each compound and GSC line (Table S4). It has recently
been reported that commonly used chemotherapy agents
(cisplatin and TMZ) inhibit NSC rather than GSC
proliferation in vitro [17], and we observed similar effects
with several compounds (e.g. amsacrine, camptothecin,
deguelin, salinomycin; Table S4). Taking the effects of
TMZ on cultured NSCs into consideration, we chose not
to evaluate compounds based on their toxicity for normal
versus malignant cells. The IC50 values for GSCs varied
considerably from low nanomolar to high micromolar,
and in some cases, for the same drug across the different
patient samples (e.g. 0.28 – 5.62 µM and 0.39 – 18.82
µM for etoposide and fluvastatin, respectively). Results
presented herein confirm the heterogeneity of response to
drugs between patients.
Examples of dose response curves for each
pharmacological class are shown in Figure 1A-F. Due to
the large variation observed across patient samples (Table
S4), average IC50 values where determined to evaluate the
general potency of individual compounds against GSCs
(Figure 2). The average IC50 for antineoplastics varied
considerably from 0.004 – 1.749 µM for vinblastine
and etoposide, respectively (Table S4). Antibacterials,
antihelminthics, cardiotonics, and compounds with
undetermined activity had IC50 values that were generally
less than 1 µM (Figure 2B-E, respectively). The other
pharmacological classes (alcohol antagonist, antifungals,
antihyperlipidermics, anti-infective and antigout agent)
showed large variation in potency (Figure 2F, Table S4).
As a crude estimate of which candidates were most
likely to be active in the central nervous system (CNS),
we compared their drug-like properties according to
Lipinski’s Rule of 5 and molecular polar surface area

A cancer stem cell is defined as an undifferentiated
cell with the ability to self-renew, differentiate to
multiple lineages, and initiate tumors that resemble the
parent tumor [3]. CD133, A2B5 and SSEA-1 have been
identified as potential GSC markers, however, the limits
of using surface markers to isolate pure tumor-initiating
populations of GBM are well recognized [16]. We
therefore adopted a cell culture model that preserves the
GSC population from human GBM samples [11], and has
the ability to produce the large number of cells required
for HTS.
GSCs were confirmed in patient-derived
cultures by functional assays of self-renewal (serial
neurosphere formation), differentiation potential, and
tumor propagation in vivo. GSCs formed neurospheres,
expressed neural stem cell markers (nestin, vimentin and
CD44; consistent with previous reports of tumorigenic
adherent GSCs [11]), and differentiated into cell lineages
expressing makers for astrocytes (GFAP+), neurons
(TUJ1+) and oligodendrocytes (O2+). Furthermore,
tumors formed in NOD/SCID mice approximately 6-8
weeks post injection confirming the presence of the GSC
phenotype (Figure S1).

The Spectrum collection was initially screened
against five GSC cultures (SN143, SN175, SN179,
SN186, and the commercially available G144) to identify

compounds showed less than 50% cell death and were
not pursued further. Although several of these compounds

reduce tumor growth in vivo (PSA ≤ 70 Å2; Table S5).
However, many newly identified drugs tested in research or
pre-clinical settings are common apoptosis inducers with
unclear mechanisms of action (e.g. gambogic acid [22];
Figure 1D), which limits their transition from research
to clinical applications. The advantages of a clinically
approved drug, such as DSF, are several-fold since the
pharmokinetics are already well-established. Furthermore,
it is known that DSF is rapidly reduced in the bloodstream
to an active metabolite, diethyldithiocarbamate (DTTC) or
methyl diethylcarbamodithioate (Me-DTTC), which can
readily penetrate the BBB (PSA = 35.22 and 60.63 Å2,
respectively) [13]. Data therefore suggest that DSF is a
lead candidate for further studies.

(PSA), predictors of orally active drugs [17] and bloodbrain barrier (BBB) penetration [18], respectively. With
the exception of some pharmacological classes, such as
antibacterials and cardiotonics, the Rule of 5 states that
most drug-like molecules have a molecular weight of 500
kDa or less, an octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) of
5 or less, up to 5 hydrogen bond donors (OH + NH count),
and up to 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (O + N atoms) [18].
Compounds with a PSA of less than 70 Å2 usually have a
higher probability of penetrating the BBB [19].
Several clinically approved drugs (e.g.
antibacterials, dactinomycin and vincristine) are known
to have poor BBB permeability (Table S5). The CNSactive antihelminthic, mebendazole, is cytotoxic to
GSCs (Figure 1E) and has recently been shown to be
active in GBM xenografts [20]. We identified a more
potent antihelminthic, pyrvinium pamoate (Figure 1F);
however, this drug is poorly absorbed in humans and
therefore unlikely to have a significant effect in vivo
[21]. The cardiotonics or cardiac glycosides represent
the pharmacological class most active against GSCs
(Table 1, Figure 1C). The ability of digitalis to inhibit the
proliferation of malignant cells has been established for
some time, but its use in cancer treatment has been widely
debated due to concerns of serious adverse effects in
humans [22]. Of the remaining clinically approved drugs,
disulfiram (DSF), which is currently used for alcohol
aversion therapy [13] was identified as a potent inhibitor
of GSC proliferation. Several experimental compounds
identified from the Spectrum collection (e.g. deguelin,
patulin and phenethyl caffeate) may have the potential to

DSF–Cu inhibits the proliferation of GSCs
derived from multiple GBM patients by inhibiting
proteasome activity
Our in vitro data suggest DSF markedly inhibits
the proliferation of patient-derived GSCs (average IC50 of
34.1 ± 6 nM). Given the inherent heterogeneity of GBM,
and the large variation in IC50 values observed for several
other compounds (Table S4), we tested additional patient
samples. IC50 values remained in the low nanomolar range
(12.1 – 56.3 nM; average 31.1 ± 12.9 nM) across the total
patient population (Figure 3, Table S6).
DSF (Figure 4A) is a member of the dithiocarbamate
family, compounds that have the ability to complex metal
ions and form a proteasomal inhibitory complex that
1128

induces apoptosis [24]. To explore this mechanism of
action in GSCs, cell viability was measured after treatment
with either DSF or a 1:1 molar ratio of DSF and copper
(Cu). Growth inhibition was significantly enhanced in
GSCs treated with DSF–Cu (Figure 4B). The inhibitory
effect observed in the absence of added copper (Figure
3) is therefore attributed to the presence of endogenous
copper, which is generally added to media to promote
cell survival. To confirm this, GSCs were cultured with
DSF and the Cu2+ chelator bathocuproinedisulfonic acid
(BCPS). As anticipated, the addition of BCPS reversed the
anti-proliferative effect of DSF–Cu, and more importantly,

reversed the inhibitory activity of DSF alone (Figure
4B). The inhibition of GSC proliferation was specific to
DSF–Cu as cells treated with DSF and zinc (Zn) were
not inhibited (Figure 4C). The DSF–Cu complex was
highly potent above 0.75 µM and time course experiments
revealed similar inhibitory effects at 24 versus 96 hours
(Figure 4D).
It has been reported that inhibition of chymotrypsin
(CT)-like proteasomal activity is associated with the
induction of apoptosis in tumor cells [25]. To further
evaluate the hypothesis that DSF inhibits proteasome
function in GSCs, cells were assayed directly for CT-

like activity. As a positive control cells were treated
with epoxomicin (10 µM), a potent inhibitor of CTlike proteasomal activity [26]. DSF alone (1 or 10 µM)
inhibited CT-like activity by ~10%, which can be attributed
to the activity of DSF complexed with endogenous copper.
The CT-like activity was significantly inhibited (by 88%)
in GSCs treated with 1 µM DSF–Cu and completely
abolished with 10 µM DSF–Cu (Figure 4E). Interestingly,
treatment with DSF–Cu inhibited proteasomal activity to
the same degree as epoxomicin (Figure 4E), confirming

that DSF–Cu is a potent inhibitor of CT-like proteasomal
activity. Taken together, results suggest that inhibition of
GSC proliferation by DSF is dependent on the formation
of a thiocarbamate-copper complex, which functions as an
inhibitor of the CT-like proteasomal activity in GSCs and
induces tumor cell death.

The effect of DSF–Cu on aldehyde dehydrogenase
activity in GSCs

as to which isoforms are detected by the Aldefluor assay
[32, 33].
Another potent ALDH inhibitor, chloramphenicol
[34], showed negligible activity against GSCs during
the initial HTS (Figure S2). This suggests that
chloramphenicol is not a general treatment option for
GBM patients as hypothesized by others [35].

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is believed to
be a functional marker of cancer stem cells and involved
in maintaining the progenitor cell phenotype [27, 28]. As
DSF is an irreversible inhibitor of ALDH [29], we tested
whether DSF–Cu treatment inhibited ALDH activity in
GSCs. ALDH was quantified by flow cytometry using
Aldefluor; a fluorescent reagent used to detect ALDH
in human cells. SKBR3 breast cancer cells, which are
known to express ALDH, were used as a positive control
[30]. An ALDH+ population of 16.8% was detected in
DMSO treated SKBR3 cells (Figure 5B), which was
diminished in cells that had been treated with the ALDH
inhibitor DEAB (Figure 5A). Treatment of SKBR3 cells
with DSF–Cu (1 µM for 24 hours) reduced the ALDH+
population to 6.2% (Figure 5C). In DMSO treated GSCs,
an ALDH+ population of 8.4% was detected relative to
the matched DEAB treated sample (Figure 5D, E), which
was reduced to 3.9% in DSF–Cu treated cells (Figure 5F).
Although data obtained here suggest that DSF–Cu may
inhibit ALDH positive populations, further studies are
needed (across a range of patient samples) to establish
the extent of ALDH activity in GBM, and to evaluate the
contribution of ALDH inhibition to GSC death. The value
of ALDH as a universal cancer stem cell marker remains
controversial as some evidence suggests that high ALDH
activity does not correlate with increased tumor initiating
capacity [31]. It should also be noted that several isoforms
of ALDH exist, different isoforms have been identified in
stem cell populations [32], and there is ongoing debate

Discussion
GBM is associated with one of the worst 5–year
survival rates of all human cancers, with an average
survival time after diagnosis of only 12–14 months.
Long-term survivors (defined as patients that survive for
more than 36 months) represent only 3–5 % of the total
patient population [36]. With the completion of large-scale
genomic sequencing projects [37] and the development of
improved transgenic mouse models [38] there has been
considerable progress in the identification of genes and
pathways which represent potential drug targets in GBM
[39-44]. Here, we report a complementary approach
using an unbiased HTS strategy for the screening of large
chemical libraries and the identification of compounds
active against patient-derived GSCs (Tables 1, S2 and
S3). Our goal was to identify therapeutic agents with
the potential to target the stem cell population, prevent
tumor recurrence, and subsequently extend survival in
GBM patients. In particular, we sought to identify agents
already approved by regulatory agencies for human use,
since existing drugs have well-established pharmokinetics
and can be rapidly tested in phase II clinical trials. Dose
response curves (Figure 1, Table S4) and average IC50
values (Figure 2) were used to evaluate drug potency.
Of the multiple candidates identified, we chose to pursue
the clinically approved drug DSF; a relatively non-toxic
compound that can readily penetrate the BBB [13].
Although the anti-cancer properties of DSF have
been known for over 40 years [45], very little is known
about the activity of this drug on brain tumors. Our in
vitro data clearly show that DSF can potently inhibit GSC
proliferation across a range of patient samples (average
IC50 = 31.1 nM; Figure 3, Table S6). The activities of
dithiocarbamates have been attributed to their ability to
form active complexes with metals (in particular copper)
which have proteasomal inhibitory and apoptosis inducing
capabilities [24]. This mechanism of action has been
demonstrated for DSF in human breast, colon and prostate
cancers [46, 47]. To explore this mechanism in GBM, we
compared cell viability and proteasomal CT-like activity
in GSCs following treatment with DSF or DSF–Cu. The
anti-proliferative activity of DSF was dependent on Cu,
and reversed in the presence of the Cu2+ chelator BCPS
(Figure 4B). The inhibition of proteasomal CT-like activity
was also potentiated by Cu (Figure 4E) and comparable to
percentage cell survival (Figure 4B), confirming that DSF–
Cu inhibits proteasome activity and induces cell death in

Figure 3: Dose response curves for GSCs treated with
DSF. For clarity, three of ten cell lines are shown corresponding

to NSCs and GSCs with the lowest and highest IC50. Data

cultured GSCs. We also observed that DSF–Cu has the
ability to inhibit ALDH activity in vitro (Figure 5). ALDH
promotes cell survival by protecting DNA from genotoxic
damage and providing resistance to a wide range of anticancer drugs [28, 48]. The inhibition of ALDH is therefore

considered an attractive approach for sensitizing resistant
cell populations to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy
agents [32, 33, 49].
Combined treatment with DSF and zinc gluconate
has been reported to have induced >50% reduction in

for 96 hours, followed by ToxCount cell viability assays. (C) The anti-proliferative effect of DSF–Cu versus DSF–Zn. SN186 cells were
treated with various concentrations of DSF–Cu or DSF–Zn (1:1 molar ratio), ranging from 0 – 10 µM, for 96 hours. Neither Cu nor Zn alone
(10 µM) affected cell viability (presented as zero DSF). (D) Time course of GSC growth inhibition by the DSF–Cu complex. SN186 cells
were treated with various concentrations of DSF–Cu (0 – 10 µM). Cell viability was measured after 24, 48, 72 or 96 hours (closed circles,
open circles, closed squares and open squares, respectively). The inhibition of GSC proliferation was identical at 24 hours versus 96 hours,
and the greatest degree of inhibition was observed at concentrations of 0.75 µM or higher. (E) Inhibition of the chymotrypsin (CT)-like
proteasomal activity by DSF–Cu. SN186 GSCs were treated with DMSO, Cu (10 µM), epoxomicin (10 µM), DSF (1 µM), DSF (10 µM),
DSF–Cu (1 µM) or DSF–Cu (10 µM), respectively, for 96 hours. CT-like activity was measured using Proteasome-Glo luminescent assays.

hepatic metastases and produced clinical remission in a
patient with stage IV metastatic ocular melanoma [50].
With this in mind, we compared the anti-tumor activity of
DSF–Zn relative to DSF–Cu. GSC proliferation was not
affected by DSF–Zn (Figure 4C), suggesting that the DSF–
Cu complex specifically inhibits proteasome activity in
GSCs. It is generally believed that cancer cells and tissues,
which contain elevated levels of copper and are dependent
on proteasome activity for their survival, should be more
sensitive to treatment with proteasome inhibitors than
normal cells and tissues [14]. Selectivity of the DSF–Cu
complex for malignant cells has been reported by others
[51], and we also observed greater selectivity for GSCs
than NSCs (IC50 31.1 nM versus 282.5 nM, respectively).
As many other anti-cancer agents are unable to distinguish
between malignant and normal cell populations (which
contributes to their toxicity in vivo), proteasome inhibitors
are considered to be promising therapeutic agents for the
treatment of cancer patients [14].
There are several proposed mechanisms by which
proteasome inhibitors mediate anti-cancer effects. One
mechanism is inhibition of the transcription factor Nuclear
Factor kappa B (NF-kB), which is critical in tumorigenesis
and over active in GBM [52]. NF-kB supports disease
progression by increasing the proliferation of tumor cells,
inducing the transcription of anti-apoptotic genes as well
as genes involved in DNA damage responses, and by

promoting angiogenesis [14]. Inhibition of proteasomal
activity promotes accumulation of the NF-kB inhibitor,
I-kB, which prevents NF-kB activation and subsequently
down regulates factors related to cancer progression
[14]. DSF, its monomer DDTC, and their derivatives are
widely recognized as inhibitors of the NF-kB pathway
[53, 54], and it is well-established that NF-kB inhibition
sensitizes tumor cells to commonly used chemotherapeutic
agents [55]. Proteasome inhibitors (including DSF) are
therefore known for their ability to potentiate the activity
of other anti-cancer drugs [55, 56]. DSF has the added
capability to decrease multidrug resistance by inhibiting
the P-glycoprotein extrusion pump [57], further supporting
its use as an adjuvant in cancer therapy.
DSF has also been reported to increase intracellular
oxidative stress and induce apoptosis in melanoma cells
[58], as well as inhibit angiogenesis and significantly
reduce Lewis lung metastatic growth and C6 glioma
development in vivo [59]. Another study has suggested
that DSF is a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, capable
of demethylating gene promoters and reactivating the
expression of epigenetically silenced genes in prostate
cancer [60]. Consistent with the multiple effects of DSF,
many studies have shown that the underlying mechanism
of action of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is
complex, and that the drug affects a range of cellular
functions [14].

Studies with breast cancer xenografts suggest that
DSF reduces tumor progression in vivo [46, 61]. High
levels of copper have been reported in patients with brain
tumors [62], and DSF is systemically absorbed as its
bis(diethyldithiocarbamato) copper complex after passage
through the acidic environment of the stomach [13], which
implies that the DSF–Cu complex can be readily formed
in vivo. It is also important to note that DSF has been
used in the clinic long-term with generally only mild side
effects [63]. Furthermore, DSF has been administered
(at 500 mg/daily for 3 months followed by 250 mg/daily
for another 50 months) to produce clinical remission
in a 64 year old female with stage IV metastatic ocular
melanoma metastatic to the liver. The average survival
of patients with this type of cancer is approximately 7
months, suggesting that treatment with DSF substantially
increased the patient’s survival (by > 46 months) [50].
Further studies are needed to determine the effect of DSF
in human GBM xenografts.
DSF is clearly a potential anti-cancer drug with the
ability to suppress tumor progression through multiple
mechanisms. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
(Velcade) is FDA approved for the treatment of multiple
myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, and is showing
positive results in clinical trials of recurrent glioma [15].
However, the main drawbacks of this drug include limited
brain penetrance and its overall toxicity in humans. The
development of proteasome inhibitors that overcome
these limitations, such as DSF, could be of greater
clinical significance in the treatment of solid tumors.
Here, we show that DSF can inhibit the proliferation of
GSCs, suggesting that this drug may have the potential to
improve prognosis in GBM patients. These observations,
combined with the ability to administer DSF long-term,
justify clinical trials of DSF either as a monotherapy or as
an adjuvant with other agents.
