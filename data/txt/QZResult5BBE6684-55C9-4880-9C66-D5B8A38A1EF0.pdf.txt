Abstract
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with distinct
molecular subtypes characterized by differential response to
targeted and chemotherapeutic agents. Enhanced understanding of the genetic alterations characteristic of different
subtypes is needed to pave the way for more personalized
administration of therapeutic agents. We have taken a
functional genomics approach using a well-characterized
panel of breast cancer cell lines to identify putative
biomarkers of resistance to antimitotic agents such as
paclitaxel and monomethyl-auristatin-E (MMAE). In vitro
studies revealed a striking difference in sensitivity to these
agents between cell lines from different subtypes, with basallike cell lines being significantly more sensitive to both
agents than luminal or HER2-amplified cell lines. Genomewide association studies using copy number data from
Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism arrays identified
amplification of the chromosome 17q21 region as being
highly associated with resistance to both paclitaxel and
MMAE. An unbiased approach consisting of RNA interference
and high content analysis was used to show that amplification
and concomitant overexpression of the gene encoding the
ABCC3 drug transporter is responsible for conferring in vitro
resistance to paclitaxel and MMAE. We also show that
amplification of ABCC3 is present in primary breast tumors
and that it occurs predominantly in HER2-amplified and
luminal tumors, and we report on development of a specific
fluorescence in situ hybridization assay that may have utility
as a predictive biomarker of taxane resistance in breast
cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5380–9]

Introduction
A key goal of modern molecular oncology is identifying the
underlying genetic and genomic abnormalities that characterize a
given tumor so that the patient can receive targeted and
chemotherapeutic agents likely to provide the most benefit. Breast
cancer is the most common form of cancer among women in the
Western World, with an estimated 1 million new diagnoses and
400,000 deaths per year worldwide (1). The advent of targeted

therapies such as tamoxifen for estrogen receptor (ER)–positive
cancer (2) and Herceptin for tumors harboring amplification of
the HER2 oncogene (3) has had significant effect on patient
survival; yet, various chemotherapy regimens still form an
important component of breast cancer treatment (4). Although
chemotherapy is a successful treatment regimen in many cases, an
estimated 50% of patients fail to benefit due to intrinsic or acquired
multidrug resistance (MDR; ref. 1). MDR refers to the resistance of
cancer cells to multiple classes of chemotherapeutic drugs that can
be structurally and mechanistically unrelated and is related to the
overexpression of a variety of proteins that act as ATP-dependent
efflux pumps (5). Understanding the molecular alterations that
contribute to MDR in breast cancer will be a crucial first step in
enabling the development of diagnostic tests capable of predicting
resistance to a given therapy and rationally selecting more
efficacious therapeutic agents.
One means of elucidating the relationship between genomic
features and therapeutic response is through pharmacogenomics,
or the study of how inherited and spontaneous genetic variation
affects sensitivity to pharmacologic agents (6). Efforts have been
directed at identifying pharmacogenomic correlates of MDR in
tumor cell lines, notably in the 60 cancer cell lines used by the
National Cancer Institute to screen for anticancer activity (the
NCI-60). At least 100,000 compounds have been screened through
the NCI-60 over the past 15 years (7), including a recent study that
profiled mRNA expression of the 48 known human ABC transporters in the NCI-60 and correlated the results with the growthinhibitory profiles of 1,429 candidate anticancer drugs. This study
identified several candidate transporters likely to confer resistance
to specific agents (8) and provided insights into the general
mechanisms of resistance across different tumor types, paving the
way for follow-up studies to investigate mechanisms specific to
individual tumor types.
Pharmacogenomic studies must also be carried out in the
context of the emerging picture of breast cancer as a heterogeneous disease with distinct molecular subtypes. A number of
studies over the past several years have shown that primary breast
tumors may be classified into at least three major subtypes by
gene expression profiling and that the subtypes have different
prognostic outcomes in terms of patient survival (9). Luminal
breast cancers are typically ER positive and characterized by
coordinate expression of a number of epithelial specific genes, a
relatively good prognosis, and good response rates to targeted
hormonal therapies. HER2-positive breast cancers are characterized by high-level gene amplification of the HER2 oncogene,
relatively poor prognosis if untreated, and significant clinical
benefit from the HER2-targeting monoclonal antibody trastuzumab
(Herceptin, Genentech; ref. 3). Basal-like breast cancers typically
lack expression of HER2, ER, and progesterone receptor (PR) and
hence are sometimes referred to as ‘‘triple-negative’’ tumors (10).

ABCC3 Amplification and Taxane Resistance

Basal-like breast cancers have a relatively poor prognosis and
currently have not been shown to respond to any targeted therapy
(11). It has recently been shown that the subtypes display
differential response to preoperative chemotherapy regimens (12);
however, for the most part, the drug resistance mechanisms
underlying these differences have yet to be determined.
Recent studies have revealed that large collections of breast
cancer cell lines reflect many of the genetic and genomic changes
characteristic of human breast tumors and hence may serve as a
model system for a population of molecularly heterogeneous
breast cancers (13). For instance, cells may be classified into basallike and luminal subtypes based on gene expression profiling
signatures and they retain most of the high-level amplifications
and deletions that are associated with poor outcome in primary
tumors (13, 14). We have used a panel of 31 breast cancer cell
lines that we have molecularly characterized as a model for
pharmacogenomic analysis to identify resistance mechanisms and
subtype differences in response to two antimitotic-based therapeutics, monomethyl-auristatin-E (MMAE) and paclitaxel. MMAE
is structurally related to dolastatin 10, a pentapeptide natural
product that has been the subject of several human clinical trials
for cancer therapy, and exhibits potent antitumor activities by
inhibiting tubulin polymerization and thus destabilize cellular
microtubules (15). Auristatin-monoclonal antibody conjugates
have been developed with the rationale that targeted delivery of
the drug through specific antigen recognition by the antibody
will lead to enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy while sparing
nontarget-expressing tissues from toxicity (15). Paclitaxel and the
related compound docetaxel are anticancer cytotoxic drugs that
stabilize microtubules and are widely used in the treatment of
breast cancer (16).
Although most in vitro profiling efforts directed at understanding drug resistance to date have focused on gene expression
analyses, here we sought to identify DNA copy number alterations
that were associated with altered drug sensitivity through analyses
of Affymetrix high-density SNP array profiles. Recent studies have
shown that high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays, in addition to their intended application in genotyping, can
be used to detect genome-wide DNA copy number changes and
loss of heterozygosity in human cancers (17). These arrays have
been shown to have applications in the identification of tumor
suppressor and oncogene loci by pinpointing recurrently deleted
or amplified chromosomal regions (18); we show here that they can
be used to identify amplified regions harboring genes that may
modulate the activity of therapeutic drugs.
The major finding of this study is that amplification of a region
of chromosome 17 (17q21) is strongly associated with in vitro
resistance to taxanes and auristatins. The region of amplification
harbors at least 100 genes; therefore, to identify the relevant gene,
we used an unbiased approach consisting of RNA interference
(RNAi) and high content analysis. These studies show that
amplification and concomitant overexpression of the ABCC3 gene
is most likely responsible for conferring resistance to paclitaxel and
MMAE. We also show that this amplicon is present in primary
breast tumors, that it occurs predominantly in HER2-amplified
tumors, and we report on development of a specific fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) assay that may have utility as a
biomarker of taxane response in breast cancer. The results also
suggest that genome-wide copy number changes assessed by SNP
arrays are a valuable tool for preclinical biomarker discovery when
used in conjunction with pharmacologic data.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines and Viability Experiments
Breast cancer cell lines AU565, BT-474, BT-549, CAMA-1, DU4475,
HCC1143, HCC1419, HCC1428, HCC2218, HCC70, Hs578T, KPL-1, MCF-7,
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-435S, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-453,
MDA-MB-468, T-47D, UACC-812, ZR-75-1, and ZR-75-30 were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines CAL-120, CAL-51,
CAL-85-1, EFM-19, EFM-192A, EVSA-T, and MT-3 were obtained from the
Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH. All
cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 or DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Sigma), nonessential amino acids, and 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine. Although annotated as breast lines, MDA-MB-435S may
actually be of melanoma origin and MT-3 of colorectal origin based on
molecular and genetic criteria (19, 20). These findings do not affect the
conclusions of this study. For MMAE and paclitaxel IC50 determination,
cells were plated in quadruplicate at a density of 3,000 per well in 384-well
plates in normal growth medium and allowed to adhere overnight.
Paclitaxel (Sigma) or MMAE (Seattle Genetics) were added in 10 concentrations based on a 3-fold dilution series (1 Amol/L maximal paclitaxel or
0.1 Amol/L maximal for MMAE). Cell viability was measured 72 h later
using the Celltiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). The
concentration of drug resulting in the 50% inhibition of cell viability (IC50)
was calculated from a four-parameter curve analysis (XLfit, IDBS software)
and was determined from a minimum of three experiments. Cell lines that
did not show 50% reduction in cell viability in response to drug treatment in
the majority of experiments conducted were considered to not have reached
an IC50 by definition and are listed as having an IC50 of >100 nmol/L
(MMAE) or >1,000 nmol/L (paclitaxel). For ABCC3-overexpressing clones of
the EVSA-T cell line that did not achieve IC50, we calculated the halfmaximal effect concentration, or EC50, in GraphPad Prism software
(GraphPad Software, Inc.).

Breast Tumor Samples
Primary breast tumors from 145 independent breast cancer patients were
used to make genomic DNA for Agilent Array comparative genomic
hybridization analysis (aCGH; ref. 21). All the tumors were fresh frozen and
found to have >70% tumor content, and all were classified as infiltrating
ductal carcinoma. ABCC3 FISH studies were conducted on 61 additional
independent primary breast tumor samples from the Genentech tumor
bank.

Gene Expression Microarray Studies
Gene expression analysis of breast cancer cell lines was carried out on
RNA extracted from subconfluent cell cultures using Qiagen RNAeasy kits.
RNA quality was verified by running samples on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100
and samples of sufficient quality were profiled on Affymetrix HGU133Plus_2.0 chips. Preparation of complementary RNA, array hybridizations,
scanning, and subsequent array image data analysis were done using the
manufacturer’s specified protocol.
For overall unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of breast cancer
cell lines, gene expression data were filtered to remove probe sets that
showed little variation across the cell lines. Briefly, probes that did not show
at least a 5-fold variation across the samples (max/min >10) and an absolute
intensity difference of at least 250 (max-min >250) were excluded from
hierarchical clustering analysis. Data preprocessing involved log-transforming and median-centering gene expression values, after which average
linkage clustering was carried out using Cluster and TreeView software (22).

SNP Array and Agilent aCGH Copy Number Studies
Cell line copy number analysis was carried out on genomic DNA
extracted from subconfluent cell cultures using Qiagen DNAeasy kits. For
each cell line, 500 ng of genomic DNA were hybridized to Genechip 100 K
mapping arrays (Affymetrix, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. These arrays contain probe sets for >116,000 SNP loci derived
from all human chromosomes (except the Y chromosome), with a mean
marker distance of 26 kb (23). SNP calls and signal quantification were
obtained with Gene Chip Operating System. Agilent Human Genome 244A

Cancer Research
CGH microarrays and Agilent feature extraction software were run
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and genome-smoothed
analysis DNA copy number (GSA_CN) was calculated based on the
hybridization intensity (the sum of both allele intensities) for each SNP
probe with the Affymetrix Chromosome Copy Number Analysis Tool 3.0
(CNAT 3.0). Copy number data were segmented with the GLAD
segmentation algorithm (24). Genome-wide analysis of copy number gains
and losses shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 were determined using the
Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer algorithm (25).
Associations between GSA_CN copy number and drug sensitivity were
identified with Matlab software (The MathWorks, Inc.) using a version of
the maxT procedure (26). For each drug, a test statistic was calculated for
each SNP reflecting the difference between log-transformed copy number in
sensitive and resistant cell lines. The statistic was calculated as the absolute
value of a standard t statistic (two sample, unequal variance), except that it
was set to zero for those SNPs with <1.75-fold difference in mean copy
number between sensitive and resistant classes. Then, the null distribution
of maximum test statistics across all SNPs was estimated in 10,000 random
permutations of the sensitivity labels. The P value for each SNP was
calculated as the fraction of permutations in which the maximum test
statistic was greater than or equal to the observed statistic for that SNP. The
resulting P values control the family-wise error rate and take into account
the number of SNPs tested.

HER2 Copy Number Determination by Quantitative Reverse
Transcription-PCR
Quantitative PCR was done using ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems) on genomic DNA prepared as described
above. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) was done using
primers CACTGTCTGCACCTTGCTTTG and GCTCTGCAGCTATTGAAAGAACAA for HER2 and AAAGCCGCTCAACTACATGG and TGCTTTGAATGCGTCCCAGAG for line-1 repetitive elements. Line-1 is a repetitive
element with similar copy numbers per haploid genome between human
normal and neoplastic cells (27). Quantification was based on standard
curves from a serial dilution of human normal genomic DNA. The
relative target copy number level was also normalized to normal human
genomic DNA as calibrator. Copy number change of target gene relative
to the line-1 and the calibrator were determined using the formula

as described by Kindich
and colleagues (28). Conditions for quantitative PCR reaction were as
described in the Invitrogen Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG
w/ROX package insert.

Fluorescence In situ Hybridization Analysis
Probes. A bacterial artificial chromosome contig comprising of two
overlapping clones, RP11-2605A1 and CTD-3006C13, covering the entire
ABCC3 loci and adjoining areas (based on the UCSS Genome Browser
March 2006 assembly) were used as a probe for the FISH experiments.
Commercially available probes for HER2/CEP17 (Pathvysion, Vysis/Abbott
Laboratories) and CEP17 (Vysis/Abbott Laboratories) were also used for the
FISH experiments.
FISH analysis. Cell lines were prepared for cytogenetic analysis by
incubation with 0.1 Ag/mL colcemid (Invitrogen) for 30 min, followed by
osmotic swelling in KCl (0.075 mol/L) and fixation in methanol/acetic acid
(3:1), as previously described (29). DNA from the bacterial artificial
chromosome clones was extracted by standard methods. The extracted
bacterial artificial chromosome DNA was directly labeled with Spectrum
Orange or Spectrum Green (Vysis/Abbott Laboratories) by nick translation
using the Vysis Nick Translation Kit (Vysis/Abbott Laboratories) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. FISH to normal human metaphases
(Abbott Laboratories) confirmed the genomic location of the bacterial
artificial chromosome clones. Approximately 300 ng of labeled probes were
precipitated in excess Human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen) and sonicated
salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) and resuspended in a 50% formamide, 10%
dextran sulfate, and 2 SSC hybridization buffer (Vysis/Abbott Laboratories) for the FISH experiments. FISH on cytogenetic preparations and
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was performed as described

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

previously (30), with some modifications. After an overnight incubation at
56jC, the slides were deparaffinized in three washes of CitroSolv for 5 min
each, followed by two washes in alcohol. After air drying, the slides were
incubated in a 1 mol/L solution of sodium sulfocyanate for 30 min at 80jC
and then were treated with pepsin before additional washes in water and a
series of ethanol. Dried slides were then codenatured (76jC for 6 min) with
the probe and were hybridized overnight at 37jC (ThermoBrite; Vysis).
Posthybridization washes and counterstaining were done in a manner
similar to those previously described. The slides were visualized using an
Olympus BX61 microscope and analyzed using FISHView software (Applied
Spectral Imaging). The copy number analysis and ratio of HER2/ABCC3 to
CEP17 was performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

Functional Validation Experiments
High-content screening assays were carried out on an Arrayscan VTI
(Cellomics, Inc.). Cells were transfected in 96-well format using small
interfering RNA (siRNA) ‘‘Smartpool’’ oligonucleotides purchased from
Dharmacon, Inc., and Oligofectamine transfection reagents. To prioritize
genes for functional studies, two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests using the R
programming language4 were done to identify genes with a significant
difference in gene expression in cell lines with >4 copies compared with
those with <4 copies of the 17q21.3 amplicon. This analysis combined with
availability of reagents for RNA interference experiments led to the selection
of the following 24 genes for functional studies in the EFM-192A cell line:
ABCC3, COL1A1, CROP, EAP, EPN3, FLJ13855, FLJ20920, HOXB7, LOC201191,
ITGB3, KIAA0924, KPNB1, LOC400604, LOC81558, MGC11242, MGC15396,
NDP52, PDK2, PHB, PP1R9B, SLC35B1, SPOP, TOB1, and WNT3. Follow-up
studies with ABCC3 siRNA were conducted in the additional cell lines
ZR75-30, MDAMB-453, and HCC-1428. A nontargeting control siRNA that
does not show significant homology to any sequence in the human genome
was used as a negative control in all RNAi experiments (as described in
technical notes online).5 After 48 or 72 h incubation at 37jC, cells were fixed
in 3.7% formaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by
labeling with a 1:500 dilution of anti–phospho-histone H3 (pH3, Upstate)
and subsequent 1:250 dilution of Alexa-fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Cells were counterstained with Hoechst33258 to allow identification of nuclei and the percentage of cells positive
for nuclear pH3 immunofluorescence, also known as the mitotic index (31),
was then quantitated for at least 1,000 cells per well using Cellomics Target
Activation software. All experiments were repeated at least thrice. qRT-PCR
to assess ABCC3 transcript levels after siRNA transfection was performed
using ABCC3-specific primers (5¶ primer GATTCCAGCCGCTTCAGTT, 3¶
primer CCTGGCTGTGCTCTACACCT).
For ABCC3 overexpression experiments, a full-length ABCC3 cDNA
cloned in the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter containing vector pCMV5
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was verified by sequencing the entire coding
sequence. The construct was transfected into EVSA-T cells and stable clones
were selected by growth in 1 mg/mL geneticin (Invitrogen). Overexpression
of ABCC3 in stable clones was confirmed by qRT-PCR on cDNA derived
from lines containing pCMV5-ABCC3, pCMV5 vector alone, or the parental
EVSA-T strain.

Results
Molecular characterization of cell lines. Affymetrix gene
expression profiling was performed on cDNA prepared from total
mRNA and Affymetrix 100 K SNP array profiling was done on DNA
from 44 breast cancer cell lines. Unsupervised analysis with the
11,000 most differentially expressed genes across the cell line panel
was used to classify the cell lines into luminal and basal-like
subtypes based on gene expression (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cell

lines classified as luminal expressed high levels of ERa and many
of the target genes regulated by ER, including GATA3, HNF3A,
IGF-IR , and XBP1. Cell lines classified as basal-like expressed high
levels of some or all of the well-described basal markers vimentin,
caveolin, MFGE8, and the basal cytokeratins such as KRT5
(Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 32). Because amplification of the
HER2 oncogene clearly defines a separate disease subtype that is
not apparent from overall gene expression classification in cell
lines (13), we determined HER2 copy number by qRT-PCR on
genomic DNA and normalization to line 1 repetitive elements for
all cell lines (Supplementary Table S1). The molecular subtype in
Fig. 1 is a classification derived from both the overall gene
expression results as well as the HER2 copy number analysis. Our
findings agree with previous reports (13) and suggest that this
collection of breast cancer cell lines reflects to some degree the
major transcriptional distinctions that define breast cancer
subtypes and to some extent are representative as models of
subtypes as luminal, basal-like, and HER2-amplified tumors.
Genome-wide patterns of copy number gain and loss in the cell
line panel show that the breast cancer cell lines harbor most of
the major copy number alterations (e.g., MYC, CCND1, HER2 gain
p16, PTEN loss) that have been described in tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2). Subtype-specific differences exist and are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2 as well as discussed in detail by Hu and

colleagues,6 but a finding relevant to this study is that amplification
at 17q21.3 is common in HER2-amplified and luminal cell lines but
not in basal-like cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2).
In vitro sensitivity to antimitotic drugs. We screened 31
breast cancer cell lines for in vitro sensitivity to paclitaxel and
MMAE as assessed by the IC50 value for each compound in a
standard luciferin-based viability assay (Supplementary Table S1;
Supplementary Fig. S3). Notably, there was significant correlation
between the relative sensitivity to each agent across the panel of
cell lines (Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient, r s = 0.55).
In addition, Fig. 1 shows that cell lines with the basal-like gene
expression signature had lower average IC50 values and were more
sensitive to each agent than luminal or HER2-amplified cell lines as
determined by Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test (P = 0.002 for MMAE,
P = 0.005 for paclitaxel).
Identification of genomic alterations that correlate with
in vitro sensitivity. We next sought to identify regions of
chromosomal gain or loss that correlated with sensitivity to
paclitaxel or MMAE through supervised analysis of SNP array
copy number data. First, cell lines were classified into either
sensitive (IC50 <10 nmol/L) or resistant (MMAE IC50 >100 nmol/L,
paclitaxel IC50 >1,000 nmol/L) groups based on the sensitivity data.
We then used the maxT algorithm (26) to analyze data from
f115,000 SNPs and identify individual SNPs where the mean copy
number differed between sensitive and resistant classes with
genome-wide significance. In the case of paclitaxel, a group of
SNPs on chromosome 17 starting at chromosome position
44,303,217 and ending at position 44,724,301 (17q21.21 to
17q21.23) showed statistically significant copy number differences
between sensitive and resistant classes (P for rs2411377 = 0.04). The
same group of markers also showed significant association between
copy number and MMAE sensitivity (P for rs2411377 = 0.05).
Figure 2 shows the relationship between paclitaxel sensitivity and
genomic DNA copy number in this part of chromosome 17 and that
a significant number of cell lines (8 of 14) that showed resistance to
paclitaxel have at least four gene copies within the region.
Identification of candidate genes in the interval. The
chromosomal region from 17q21.31 to 17q21.33 encodes f100
expressed transcripts according to the University of California
Santa Cruz Genome Browser.7 Based on the principle that
functionally relevant genes in regions of amplification should
exhibit a concomitant increase in mRNA expression, we filtered this
list down to 24 genes that showed significant overexpression upon
amplification and had reagents available to conduct RNAi studies.
An example of significantly higher expression of the candidate gene
ABCC3 in amplified cell lines compared with nonamplified cell lines
is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4. These 24 genes were selected for
subsequent functional analysis to identify the locus responsible for
conferring resistance to taxanes and auristatins.
Functional validation of ABCC3 by RNA interference. We
used an RNA interference strategy to identify the gene responsible
for mediating resistance to taxanes and auristatins in amplified cell
lines. The assay utilized made use of the fact that treatment of cells
with paclitaxel or MMAE results in a block of cell cycle progression
at the M phase that can be assayed by the presence of the mitotic

marker pH3 (33). Phosphorylation at Ser10 of histone H3 is tightly
correlated with chromosome condensation during the M phase,
and the percentage of cells that are positive for pH3 staining, or
mitotic index, can be determined through an immunofluorescence
assay. We reasoned that cellular knockdown of the gene-mediating
resistance should increase sensitivity of cell lines harboring the
amplification to paclitaxel and MMAE and hence result in an
accumulation of arrested cells and a higher mitotic index relative
to control-treated cells at a given drug concentration. Higher
mitotic index correlates with reduction in viability and proliferation determined by other assays8 but is a more specific readout of
the antimitotic effects of these drugs. We found that RNAi of 23 of
the 24 candidate genes did not reproducibly result in accumulation
of arrested cells and increased mitotic index in EFM-192A cells
(data not shown), but that RNAi of ABCC3/MRP3 resulted in a 2- to
3-fold increase in mitotic index relative to control treatment with a
nontargeting control siRNA in the cell lines EFM-192A and ZR75-30
(Fig. 3A and B). In contrast, ABCC3 RNAi did not appreciably alter

transcript level was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Supplementary
Fig. S5). Similar results were obtained with MMAE (data not
shown). ABCC3/MRP3 (henceforth referred to as ABCC3) is a
member of the MDR-associated protein (MRP) subfamily of ATPdependent drug efflux pumps (34).
Overexpression of ABCC3 causes in vitro MDR. Given that
ABCC3 knockdown increased sensitivity to paclitaxel and MMAE,
we tested whether ABCC3 overexpression in taxane- and MMAEsensitive cells with low levels of ABCC3 would render cells resistant
to these agents. EVSA-T cells were selected as a model to generate
ABCC3-overexpressing lines because they do not show ABCC3
amplification and express low levels of ABCC3 transcripts. Three
independently derived lines were confirmed to overexpress ABCC3
transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S5) and screened for in vitro
sensitivity to paclitaxel and MMAE using an ATP-based luminescence assay. All three overexpressing cell lines were at least 20-fold
less sensitive to paclitaxel and MMAE based on EC50 values and
also showed markedly less inhibition of cell growth compared with
a vector-alone control stable cell line in an ATP-based luminescence assay (Fig. 4).

ABCC3 Amplification and Taxane Resistance

Amplification of ABCC3 occurs in breast tumors. Analysis of
the region of chromosome 17 encompassing HER2 and ABCC3
in the cell line 100K SNP array data suggested that the ABCC3
amplicon was most commonly associated with the HER2-amplified
subtypes and was not seen in the cell lines classified as luminal or
basal-like (Fig. 5, top two panels).
To ensure that ABCC3 amplification was not a cell line–specific
phenomenon, we also characterized copy number data at the
ABCC3 locus using Agilent aCGH arrays on DNA from 145 primary
breast tumors. These tumor samples were also classified into
luminal, basal-like, and HER2 subtypes using a predictor based on
expression levels of ER, PR, and HER2 as described by Hu and
colleagues.6 ABCC3 copy number gains (>3.5 copies) are present in
25% of HER2-amplified and 11% of luminal tumors but were not
present in basal-like tumors (Fig. 5, bottom two panels).
Finally, to confirm the cytogenetic basis of the apparent copy
number gains observed by SNP and aCGH arrays, we developed a
FISH assay using a bacterial artificial chromosome clone (see
Materials and Methods) spanning the ABCC3 locus and performed
FISH analysis on select cell lines and 61 primary tumors that had
been classified as overexpressing HER2 based on the HerceptTest
(immunohistochemistry assay, reviewed in ref. 35; data not shown).
The FISH results from cell lines corroborated the data obtained
from the SNP array and qPCR analyses. As depicted in Fig. 6A,
cell line EFM-192A predicted from SNP arrays to have elevated
ABBC3 copy number indeed exhibited a high-level amplification of
ABCC3, which is manifested as homogeneously staining regions

with single or multiple integration into various chromosomes
while maintaining single copies of HER2 and ABCC3 on
chromosome 17 (Fig. 6A and B). Cell lines predicted to be diploid
for ABCC3 based on SNP array analysis were confirmed to be
diploid based on FISH analysis with CEP17 and ABCC3 (data not
shown). FISH analysis of the 61 HER2-positive primary tumors
that were screened for ABCC3 amplification confirmed that
elevated copy number at ABCC3 is common in HER2-positive
breast tumors (Fig. 6C and D; Supplementary Table S2). High-level
gene amplification (>2.2 ratio of ABCC3/CEP17; see Fig. 6C) was
seen in 25% of the tumors, whereas an additional 11% of the
tumors showed moderate increases for ABCC3 (3–7 copies of
ABCC3, see Fig. 6D) for ABCC3. Interestingly, a number of tumors
show evidence of heterogeneity and exhibit cells with both very
high-level amplification of ABCC3 alongside cells with diploid copy
number of ABCC3.

Discussion
Molecular classification of breast cancers into subtypes with
shared features and similar prognostic outcomes provides a
framework to begin efforts to individualize cancer therapy. We
have shown here that a large collection of breast cancer cell lines
reflects many of the genetic and genomic alterations characteristic
of human breast tumors and that subtypes show clear differences
in response to antimitotic agents, with the basal-like subtype
being the most sensitive. We present functional evidence that one

four different cell lines after ABCC3 or control siRNA treatment. A and B, ZR-75-30 and EFM-192A cells have amplification and overexpression of ABCC3 and display
enhanced sensitivity (increased mitotic index) after knockdown. C and D , HCC-1428 and MDA-MB-453 have low copy number and expression and do not show
increased sensitivity upon ABCC3 knockdown.

Figure 4. Stable overexpression of ABCC3 results in
in vitro resistance to paclitaxel and MMAE. Stable cell
lines derived from single cell clones that overexpress
ABCC3 from the CMV promoter or a control line with
empty vector were assayed for growth-inhibitory
effects of paclitaxel (A ) or MMAE (B ). Treatment of
ABCC3-overexpressing clones did not result in 50%
reduction of cell viability in a 3 d assay so the fold
change in sensitivity was assessed by calculating the
concentration that resulted in half-maximal response,
or EC50. Specifically, the EC50 for the vector control
treated with paclitaxel was 0.2 nmol/L, whereas the
EC50 values for the ABCC3-expressing lines were 5, 10,
and 80 nmol/L, respectively. The EC50 for the vector
control–treated with MMAE was 0.05 nmol/L, whereas
the EC50 values for the ABCC3-expressing lines were
1.5, 12, and 90nmol/L, respectively. The vector control
cell line was clonally derived from EVSA-T and unlike
the parental cell line exhibited an IC50 in response to
paclitaxel and MMAE in the experiment shown.

mechanism for this differential response is amplification of the
ABCC3 drug efflux pump in a subset of luminal and HER2amplified cell lines but not in basal-like cell lines. Future functional
genomic efforts in this cell line panel should help identify targeted
agents likely to specifically show efficacy in one or more of the
subtypes, a particularly pressing need for the basal-like or triplenegative class of tumors. The detailed understanding of the
molecular alterations in the cell lines also raises the likelihood of
identifying biomarkers of efficacy that are not only correlated with
response but also linked to the biology of the target pathway being
modulated.
ABCC3 overexpression has been implicated in acquired MDR
in cancer cell lines in previous studies. For instance, Liu and
colleagues report 459-fold overexpression of ABCC3 relative to the
parental in a cell line, MCF-7/AdVp3000, that was derived by
selection for growth in the presence of doxorubicin (36). In
addition, it has recently been shown that treatment of carcinoma
cell lines with vincristine results in significant up-regulation of
ABCC2 and ABCC3 transcripts in these cells (37). The closely
related pumps ABCC2 (MRP2) and ABCC10 (MRP7) have both
been shown to confer paclitaxel resistance when overexpressed
(37, 38), and moreover ABCC2 has been shown to be an important
determinant of paclitaxel pharmacokinetics in vivo in mouse
models (39). Paclitaxel has not been previously shown to be a
substrate for ABCC3 and indeed studies of ectopic overexpression
of ABCC3 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells or NIH-3T3 cells
have failed to show increased resistance to paclitaxel (40, 41).
Notably, one of these studies also found (40) that ABCC3

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

overexpression does not confer resistance to doxorubicin in longterm assays despite other published reports of functional studies
suggesting a role for ABCC3 in transporting this agent (36). Taken
together, these findings suggests that either the ability of ABCC3
to transport paclitaxel is context or cell type dependent, or that
differences in assay format or duration account for the apparent
role for ABCC3 in transporting paclitaxel in breast cancer
suggested by our studies.
An unusual aspect of our findings is that resistance may be
derived from an amplification event present in the primary tumor
independent of prior selection due to drug treatment because a
number of the samples profiled are mostly either primary tumors
or cell lines derived from such tumors or pleural effusions collected
at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, it may be postulated that
Chr17q21.31-21.33 amplification is selected as part of tumor
evolution/homeostasis and that ABCC3 amplification is coamplified as a passenger gene that confers serendipitous chemotherapy
resistance. As such, ABCC3 amplification may represent a
mechanism of intrinsic resistance present in the tumor due to
amplification of adjacent sequences that are presumably being
selected for during the process of tumorigenesis. One possible
candidate for such selection of Chr17q21.31-21.33 amplification is
the nearby gene Myst2, which encodes a histone acetyltransferase
that has been shown by Hu and colleagues6 to result in
transformation in soft agar when overexpressed in cell lines that
do not normally have amplification or overexpression of Myst2.
Other examples of amplification of ABC transporters have been
reported, but usually in the context of the tumor-evolving

ABCC3 Amplification and Taxane Resistance

resistance. For instance, resistant variants of the T-cell leukemia
cell line CCRF-CEM selected by growth in increasing levels of the
anthracycline epirubicin were shown to have acquired amplification of the ABCC1/MRP1 gene (42).
Other studies have also addressed resistance mechanisms to
paclitaxel in breast cancer and have hinted at a multiplicity of
mechanisms. For instance, a recent report suggested that in
primary cell cultures derived from breast carcinomas, expression of
PR was negatively correlated with response to paclitaxel in the
adjuvant setting (43). This finding is consistent with the
observation here that basal-like breast cancer cell lines are more
sensitive to paclitaxel on average than luminal or HER2-amplified
lines. Another potential mechanism that has been identified is
paclitaxel-triggered phosphorylation of the protein caveolin-1,
which has been shown to sensitize cells to apoptosis by regulating
cell cycle progression and activation of the apoptotic signaling
molecules p53 and p21 (44). Because caveolin-1 expression is
highest in basal-like breast cancers (45), this is another potential
mechanism to explain the differential antimitotic response
observed across subtypes. Finally, gene expression studies on
biopsies obtained before adjuvant chemotherapy followed by
functional studies in vitro have suggested that low expression of
the microtubule-binding protein tau is a potential biomarker for
pathologic response to paclitaxel-containing regimens (46). The
results described in this article affirm that even well-defined

subtypes such as HER2-positive breast cancer may harbor
unexpected heterogeneity that may affect response to therapeutics,
in this case amplification of the ABCC3 transporter in 25% to 35%
of primary HER2-amplified breast tumors. All of these results taken
together highlight the fact that breast cancer is a heterogeneous
disease that can evade chemotherapy through multiple mechanisms and highlight the need for panels of biomarkers that can be
used to predict response in individual tumors.
The results presented here also illustrate the utility of highdensity SNP arrays for biomarker discovery when used in
conjunction with pharmacologic data in cell lines. A key advantage
of this approach is that gene amplification events are relatively
stable and can ultimately be assayed by FISH on archival samples
from clinical trials. FISH assays are already part of routine clinical
practice in the diagnosis of HER2-positive MBC (47) A recent
retrospective analysis of 1,500 women with node-positive breast
cancer showed that expression or amplification HER2 in a breast
cancer is associated with enhanced clinical benefit from the
addition of paclitaxel after adjuvant treatment with doxorubicin
compared with patients with HER2-negative, ER-positive, and
node-positive breast cancer (48). However, a significant fraction
of women with HER2-positive tumors failed to show a survival
benefit in this study, suggesting the possibility that paclitaxel
resistance mechanisms are also present in a proportion of HER2positive breast tumors. Utilizing a FISH assay to stratify patients by

indicative of very high level amplification in this tumor.
The tumor sample in D shows evidence of multiple
copies of ABCC3 and polysomy for chromosome 17 as
indicated by multiple copies of CEP17 in each nucleus.

ABCC3 amplification status in this setting would allow determination as to whether ABCC3 amplification correlates with lack of
clinical benefit from taxane-containing regimens and hence
whether ABCC3 amplification could serve as a biomarker to
identify patients who should receive other chemotherapeutic
agents in addition to taxanes.
Future studies with this large panel of well-characterized cell
lines should help to identify additional genomic alterations that
predict response to chemotherapeutics as well as novel targeted
agents and lead to the development of companion diagnostic tests
that can be validated in clinical studies and ultimately to match
patients with appropriate therapies.
