Abstract
Pattern recognition receptors allow the innate immune system to perceive the presence of microbial products and to
launch the ﬁrst steps of the defense response. Some pattern
recognition receptors also sense endogenous ligands that are
released from uninfected dying cells, thereby activating
immune responses against dead-cell antigens. This applies to
toll-like receptors 3 and 4 (TLR3, TLR4), which sense doublestranded RNA and high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1),
respectively, as well as to formyl peptide receptor-1 (FPR1),
which interacts with Annexin A1 (ANXA1) from dead cells.
Breast cancer patients who bear loss-of-function alleles in TLR3,

TLR4, and FPR1 exhibit a reduced metastasis-free and overall
survival after treatment with anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. These genetic defects are epistatic with respect to
each other, suggesting that they act on the same pathway,
linking chemotherapy to a therapeutically relevant anticancer
immune response. Loss-of-function alleles in TLR4 and FPR1
also affect the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients treated
with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Altogether, these results
support the idea that conventional anticancer treatments rely
on stimulation of anticancer immune responses to become
fully efﬁcient. Cancer Res; 76(11); 3122–6. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

profound effect on local immune responses against tumor-associated antigens that, if favorable, contributes to positive treatment
outcome (6). More and more specialists in the ﬁeld embrace the
idea that successful cancer treatments achieve their long-term
efﬁcacy by the reinstatement of an active phase of immunosurveillance (7, 8).
In evolutionary terms, the immune system has not been
designed to eliminate (pre)malignant cells. Rather, it has to
maintain the precarious equilibrium between the quasi-sterile
interior of our cells and the intercellular space and continuous
attempts of viral or bacterial pathogens to trespass epithelial
barriers and to invade their host. In the middle of this arduous
multitask, the immune system must elude the recognition and
destruction of normal cells to avoid autoinﬂammatory processes
and autoimmune disease. The distinction of harmless self and
microbial foes is greatly facilitated by so-called "pathogen recognition receptors" (PRR), which sense the undue presence of viral
or bacterial products within the intra- and extracellular compartments (9). PRRs are also dubbed as "pattern recognition receptor"
because they detect common molecular patterns of viruses, bacteria, and their products. Once engaged, such receptors signal to
activate innate immune responses that subsequently may trigger
more elaborate, acquired responses involving T or B lymphocytes.
Prominent PRRs include toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), which senses
double-stranded RNAs from viruses, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),
which detects bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and formyl
peptide receptor-1 (FPR1), which binds peptides with a posttranslational modiﬁcation (formylation of methionine) that is
rather speciﬁc for bacteria. Importantly, such PRRs have alternative host genome–encoded ligands that usually cannot be perceived because they are located intracellularly, yet are detected
when they are released from dying cells. Such ligands are collectively referred to as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP;

The spectacular clinical success of the so-called checkpoint
blockers against previously intractable malignant diseases has
convinced clinicians as well as anticancer drug developers about
the reality of immunosurveillance (1). However, well before
immunotherapy has become en vogue, a large body of evidence
in favor of the clinical importance of immunosurveillance has
been generated by scientists and largely ignored by clinicians and
pharmacologists. For over a decade, there has been no doubt that
the density, distribution, composition, and functional state of the
anticancer immune inﬁltrate, as found at the stage of diagnosis,
has a major impact on the natural course of malignant diseases
(2, 3), as well as on treatment responses to chemotherapeutic
agents or so-called "targeted" therapeutics (4, 5). Indeed, classical
chemotherapeutics (and to some extent radiotherapies) have a

Pattern Recognition Receptors in Anticancer Chemotherapy

ref. 10) or cell death–associated molecules (CDAM; ref. 11). Thus,
(i) TLR3 can respond to the aberrant presence of extracellular RNA
and RNA/DNA complexes released from cells that have succumbed to anthracycline-based chemotherapy; (ii) TLR4 interacts
with the most abundant non-histone chromatin-binding protein,
high mobility group B1 (HMGB1), when it has extruded from
the nuclei of dead cells and appears in the extracellular space; and
(iii) FPR1 can bind a normally cytosolic protein, Annexin A1
(ANXA1), once it has been released from dying or dead cells. This
means that chemotherapeutic agents that induce stress and death
of cancer cells can orchestrate a local tissue response that resembles the one observed after microbial infection in the sense that it
leads to the concerted activation of multiple PRRs (12). Remarkably, distinct chemotherapeutics may differ in their capacity to
trigger the release of pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMP)/CDAMs from cancer cells, a phenomenon that is likely
tied to their capacity to elicit premortem stress responses in
malignant cells (7, 8). Many of the cytotoxic anticancer agents
employed for the treatment of breast cancer, such as anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and taxanes, are particularly efﬁcient
in triggering PAMP/CDAM release and hence to stimulate an
immune response (7, 8).
As cancer cells are antigenically different from normal cells,
the ensuing innate immune response can culminate in the recognition of tumor-associated antigens and the recognition/
destruction of malignant cells by speciﬁc T lymphocytes. Hence,
successful chemotherapies hijack innate and cognate immune
responses by a mechanism that may be referred to as "viral
mimicry" (12). By stressing and killing malignant cells in a way
that resembles viral infection (and that even leads to the activation
of a type I IFN response), anthracyclines and oxaliplatin stimulate
an anticancer immune response.

Defects in Immune Responses against
Cancer
The aforementioned concept can be rephrased in the following
way. The immunogenicity of cancer cells results from a combination of signals, namely (i) antigenicity, that is, the presence of
tumor-associated antigens, mostly resulting from mutations
(neoantigens) and the undue transcription of genes that usually
are only expressed in the placenta or in the testis (carcinoembryonic antigens) and (ii) adjuvanticity, that is, the presence of
ligands that can bind to, and signal through, PRRs.
Seen in this way, there are multiple mechanisms that may
explain the failure of immunosurveillance against cancers. First,
the tumor may lose their speciﬁc antigens (through "immunoselection" by immune effectors resulting into "immunoediting"
of the tumor and hence the emergence of antigen loss variants) or
simply hide them (for instance due to the downregulation of
MHC class I molecules required to present antigenic peptides;
ref. 1). On the side of the host, "holes" in the T-cell repertoire may
contribute to the emergence of cancer cell variants that express
unrecognizable tumor antigens. Second, the molecular pathways
required for signaling adjuvanticity can be disrupted, either at the
level of PRRs or at the level of their ligands. Thus, cancers can lose
the expression of PAMPs/CDAMs. For example, the expression of
HMGB1 diminishes during breast cancer progression (13), and its
absence has a negative prognostic impact (14), coupled with a
general reduction of the local immune inﬁltrate (15). Similarly,
the expression of ANXA1 is lost in a large majority of breast

www.aacrjournals.org

cancers (16), although the impact of this loss on local immune
responses has not been studied. Importantly, genetic defects in
PRRs recognizing PAMPs/CDAMs may cause a general state of
immunodeﬁciency that compromises cancer immunosurveillance and negatively affects patient prognosis (Fig. 1A).
Loss-of-function polymorphism in TLR3
A SNP, rs3775291(1234 C>T), in TLR3 causing a single amino
acid exchange (L412F) in the RNA-binding region of this receptor
negatively inﬂuences the fate of patients with triple-negative or
Her2þ breast cancer (17) and colorectal carcinoma (18), as it
increases or decreases natural resistance to infection by multiple
viruses, including cytomegalovirus, human immunodeﬁciency
virus-1, hepatitis C virus, and herpes simplex. rs3775291 reduces
the expression and signaling function of TLR3 (19). Experiments
in mice indicate that the absence of TLR3 expression by cancer
cells (but not by the host immune system) has a negative impact
on the efﬁcacy of anthracycline-based chemotherapies (20, 21). In
a hypothetical scenario, anthracyclines kill a fraction of cancer
cells, releasing RNA and DNA/RNA complexes that act on TLR3
expressed by residual cancer cells to stimulate the production of
type I IFNs. Through an autocrine or paracrine mechanism, type I
IFNs then stimulate the common type I IFNa/b receptor (IFNAR),
hence eliciting the transcription of type I IFN response genes
(IRG), including C-X-C motif chemokine (CXCL) 10, which acts
on the chemokine receptor CXCL3 to attract T lymphocytes into
the tumor bed (12, 20).
Loss-of-function polymorphism in TLR4
The SNP rs4986790 (896A>G) in TLR4 causes the amino acid
exchange (D299G) that is in strong linkage disequilibrium with
another substitution (1196C/T, T399I), both affecting the ectodomain of the receptor and reducing its function. Persons with
this TLR4 haplotype are less responsive to LPS and have an
increased risk of severe infection by gram-negative bacteria
(22), as well as of chronic inﬂammatory bowel disease (23).
rs4986790 may protect against malaria (24), yet increases the
global cancer risk (25). In addition, breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy, as well as colorectal cancer patients receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy,
exhibit a comparatively short overall (OS) and progression-free
survival (PFS) if they bear rs4986790 (26, 27). In mice, the
absence of TLR4 expression by immune cells results in the incapacity of anthracyclines, oxaliplatin, and radiotherapy to reduce
tumor growth (26). This therapeutic failure has been explained
by the requirement of HMGB1 leaking out from dead cancer
cells to stimulate TLR4 expressed on myeloid cells. The stimulation of TLR4 on dendritic cells (DC) is indispensable for their
capacity to cross-present tumor antigens and hence to stimulate a
protective anticancer immune response mediated by speciﬁc
CD8þ T lymphocytes (21).
Loss-of-function polymorphism in FPR1
The SNP rs867228 (1037A>C) in FPR1 provokes an amino acid
substitution (G346A) in the intracellular C-terminus of the protein, thereby abolishing its dimerization, which is required for
signaling. Breast cancer patients bearing the rs867228 loss-offunction allele of FPR1 in homozygosis (FPR1AA) or heterozygosis
(FPR1CA) have reduced metastasis-free survival and OS after
adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy. In addition, FPR1AA

Pattern Recognition Receptors in Anticancer Chemotherapy

FPR1CAdonors. FPR1 is mostly expressed by myeloid cells, rarely
by malignant cells. Accordingly, knockout of Fpr1 from several
transplantable cancer cell lines did not affect their response to
chemotherapy in vivo. However, knockout of Fpr1 in the host
immune system compromised chemotherapy-induced antitumor
immunity and hence led to treatment failure (28). Indeed, while
anthracyclines and oxaliplatin reduced the growth of several
transplantable cancer cells in immunocompetent mice, they lost
their therapeutic potential when the same cancer types evolved in
Fpr1/ mice or wild-type mice bearing an Fpr1/ hematopoietic
system (28). Functionally relevant FPR1 was mostly expressed by
DC precursors recruited into the tumor postchemotherapy. In
response to ANXA1 released from dying cancer cells, such FPR1þ
-DCs migrated into the immediate vicinity of the dead cells,
allowing them to take up portions of the malignant cells and to
cross-present their antigens (28). In the absence of functional
FPR1, DCs were still attracted into the tumor postchemotherapy.
However, they failed to approach dead cancer cells, resulting in a
consequent defect in antigen presentation and T cell–mediated
tumor growth control (28). The deﬁciency in antigen presentation
could be detected indirectly by gene expression analyses, revealing
the requirement of FPR1 for the induction of numerous immunorelevant genes. Such genes apparently are also important for the
fate of breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, meaning that low expression correlates with poor therapeutic outcome (28).
Epistatic analyses simultaneously evaluating the effects of SNPs
in FPR1, TLR3, and TLR4 (with a minor allele frequency in
Caucasians of 0.21, 0.23, and 0.06, respectively) on breast cancer
patient survival lend strong support to the idea that the three
polymorphisms act on the same, presumably immune-related
pathway (Fig. 1B). Thus, among patients bearing one deﬁcient
TLR3 or TLR4 allele, who have a tendency toward poor prognosis
(as compared with patients with normal TLR3 and TLR4 alleles),
the FPR1 genotype does not further inﬂuence patient survival. In
other words, for a breast cancer patient, it is sufﬁcient to be
heterozygous in one among the three loss-of-function SNPs to
have a bad prognosis, while it is necessary to be homozygous for
functional alleles of all three genes to have a good prognosis (28).

Implications and Future Directions
The idea that genetically determined immune defects increase
the susceptibility of patients to infectious disease has been examined in too much detail, leading to the concept that many cases of
lethal or debilitating infection are due to monogenic inborn errors
of immunity (29). It is noteworthy that the common variants in
TLR3 and TLR4 that worsen the prognosis of breast cancer patients
also affect the susceptibility to a variety of infectious disease. As a
possibility, human populations who are heterogeneous in the
function of these PRRs might have the evolutionary advantage

that portions of them are protected against lethal or chronic
infection by speciﬁc microorganisms (22–24), explaining why
SNPs affecting major PRRs have been maintained over evolution.
To our knowledge, no study has linked rs867228 in FPR1 to a
particular disease. However, other SNPs in FPR1 predispose to the
development of aggressive periodontitis (30), suggesting that
FPR1 mutations may follow a similar logic in their population
distribution, as do mutations in toll-like receptors. Nonetheless,
the speciﬁc infectious diseases that are inﬂuenced by rs867228 in
FPR1 remain to be identiﬁed.
As explained above, cancers may suppress the expression of
DAMPs/CDAMs interacting with PRRs to avoid immunosurveillance. It will be important to determine the expression of DAMPs/
CDAMs by cancer cells, as well as the genetic defects in the
corresponding PRRs, on the same large cohort of patients and to
correlate these parameters with an extensive analysis of the
immune inﬁltrate. This approach could explore the articulation
between DAMPs/CDAMs, PRRs, and local immune responses in
the clinical setting. For example, it can be predicted that loss of
HMGB1 and ANXA1 would be less frequent in patients that bear
loss-of-function mutations in TLR4 and FPR1, respectively, if the
driving force leading to the suppression of HMGB1 and ANXA1
was immunosurveillance (rather than a cancer cell–intrinsic process). Taken together, all these parameters should improve risk
stratiﬁcation of cancer patients. Moreover, well beyond these
considerations, it may be worthwhile to launch an unbiased
search for genetically determined immune defects that may predispose to oncogenesis or tumor progression due to attenuated
anticancer immunosurveillance.
