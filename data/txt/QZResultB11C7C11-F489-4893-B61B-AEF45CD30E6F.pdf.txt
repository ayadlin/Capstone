ABSTRACT
MiRNAs may promote or inhibit tumor recurrence and drug resistance.
MiR-139-5p is reportedly downregulated in colorectal cancer patient samples, but it is
unknown whether and how miR-139-5p regulates drug resistance. Cancer stem cells
(CSCs) are postulated to be important promoters of multiple drug resistance (MDR).
In this study, we established a MDR cell model which strongly expressed the CSCassociated biomarkers CD44 and CD133. MiR-139-5p expression was reduced in MDR cell
lines, while overexpression of miR-139-5p reversed CD44+/CD133+-associated MDR.
We also identified NOTCH1, an important protein for stem cell maintenance and
function, as a direct target of miR-139-5p, both in vitro and in a knockout mouse
model. Notch1 expression was upregulated in tumor samples and inversely correlated
with expression of miR-139-5p. Silencing NOTCH1 exerted an effect similar to
overexpression of miR-139-5p by inhibiting the CD44+ and CD133+ population and
reversing the drug-resistant phenotype. In conclusion, miR-139-5p downregulated
NOTCH1 signaling to reverse CD44+/CD133+-associated MDR in colorectal cancer
cells. Given this insight into the miRNA regulation of MDR, miR-139-5p could be a
promising therapeutic target for colorectal cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

correlate with MDR [7–9]. CSCs can be defined by their
high expression of CD44 [10] and CD133, and this unique
phenotype allows the identification of colorectal CSCs as a
distinct population from the bulk tumor cells. This CD44+/
CD133+ cell population is thought to initiate and sustain
tumor growth, and thus is an obvious target for therapeutic
treatment [11]. The CD133+/CD44+ population, which
comprises the cancer initiating cells (CICs) [12], may be
the best biomarker for the early detection of CRC [13–15].
As miRNAs may promote or suppress tumorigenesis
by binding to various targets, there has been intensive
research into miRNAs as cancer biomarkers and
treatment targets [16]. We previously reported that
miR-139-5p expression was frequently lower in CRC

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cause of cancer-related death, but treatment of CRC often
fails to eradicate all of the tumor cells because the cells
have intrinsic or acquired drug resistance [1, 2]. The
mechanisms by which cells develop multidrug resistance
(MDR) have been extensively studied, yet the cause of
MDR is still unknown [3]. Therefore, understanding
the mechanism of MDR in CRC cells is crucial for the
optimization of current therapeutic techniques.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are thought to be key
promoters of drug resistance [4–6], particularly to
chemotherapeutic drugs [4, 7, 8]. In CRC, CSCs may

patient samples than in normal colorectal tissues, and
correlated significantly with advanced clinical stages [17].
MiR-139-5p has also been validated as tumor suppressor
in other cancers, including gastric carcinoma [18], breast
carcinoma [19], and hepatocellular carcinoma [20, 21].
In this study, we used oxaliplatin (L-OHP; a
platinum anticancer drug for the treatment of CRC) and
vincristine (VCR; a broad-spectrum anticancer drug) to
establish a drug-resistant cell model, and explored the
involvement of CSCs, miR-139-5p, and its potential target
(NOTCH1) in CRC drug resistance.

CD133+ cells were also confirmed by Western blotting
(Figure 2B). We then treated these cells with different
anticancer drugs, and found that the IC50 values of VCR,
L-OHP, 5-FU or Mit were significantly higher in CD44+/
CD133+ cells than in the parental cells (Figure 2C).
The above studies illustrated that CD44+/CD133+ cells
have both CSC-like characteristics and MDR capacities,
indicating that MDR correlates with CSC properties.

RESULTS

We next performed qRT-PCR to evaluate
miR-139-5p expression in CD44+/CD133+ cells. MiR139-5p expression was approximately 50% lower
(p < 0.01) in CD44+/CD133+ cells than in the parental
group (Figure 3A). When we transfected these cells
with miR-139-5p mimics and/or treated them with
various anticancer drugs, forced miR-139-5p expression
significantly enhanced the sensitivity of CD44+/CD133+
cells to VCR, L-OHP, 5-FU and Mit, and significantly
reduced their IC50 (Figure 3B). Increased expression
of miR-139-5p also suppressed colony formation
(Figure  3C). Because the induction of apoptosis is an
important indicator of the chemotherapeutic sensitivity
of cancer cells, we used flow cytometry to detect the
apoptotic capacity of miR-139-5p/control cells in the
presence of L-OHP at the IC50. After 24-hour treatment,
miR-139-5p-transfected cells displayed greater sensitivity
towards these chemotherapeutic agents, as more cells
underwent apoptosis after the treatment (Figure 3D).
We also subcutaneously implanted tumors derived
from the vector- and miR-139-5p-transfected HCT116
CD44+/CD133+ cells into mice. In vivo, CD44+/CD133+
HCT116 cells had a stronger tumorigenic potential than
cells treated with miR-139-5p, L-OHP, or miR-1395p+L-OHP (Figure 3E). Thus, miR-139-5p increased the
sensitivity of CD44+/CD133+ cells to antitumor drugs,
suggesting that miR-139-5p could reverse CD44+/
CD133+-associated MDR.

MiR-139-5p reverses CD44+/CD133+-associated
MDR

MiR-139-5p function is associated with MDR
We established L-OHP- or VCR-resistant human
CRC cell lines (HCT116/L-OHP and HCT8/VCR,
respectively) by repeatedly exposing cells to these drugs.
The cells also displayed significant cross-resistance to
fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C (Mit) (Figure 1A).
To evaluate the relationship of miRNA with MDR, we
used qRT-PCR to examine the expression of miR-139-5p
in drug-resistant cells. MiR-139-5p expression was
approximately 30–40% lower (p < 0.01) in drug-resistant
cancer cells than in the parental stains (Figure 1B). Thus,
miR-139-5p expression may inversely correlate with MDR.
With this in mind, we next transfected cells with miR-1395p mimics, and confirmed the re-expression of mature miR139-5p by qRT-PCR. Intriguingly, increased expression of
miR-139-5p suppressed colony formation (Figure 1C).
Notably, forced miR-139-5p expression significantly
enhanced the sensitivity of HCT116/L-OHP and HCT8/
VCR to VCR, L-OHP, 5-FU and Mit, and significantly
reduced their half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
(Figure 1D). As miR-139-5p increased the sensitivity of
drug-resistant strains to antitumor drugs, miR-139-5p may
be able to reverse MDR.

MDR correlates with CSC properties

MiRNA-139-5p directly binds to and
functionally suppresses NOTCH1

We speculated that drug-resistant cells may have
cancer stem cell-like characteristics, which can be
detected by the CSC surface markers CD44 and CD133.
Flow cytometry of control and drug-resistant HCT116 and
HCT8 cells revealed that the expression of these surface
markers increased, especially CD133 (~90%, Figure 2A),
with the emergence of the resistant phenotype. This
increase in CD44 and CD133 expression demonstrated
that a drug-resistance phenotype could correlate with CSC
properties. To confirm this hypothesis, we established
HCT116 CD44+/CD133+ and HCT8 CD44+/CD133+ cell
lines by sorting HCT116 and HCT8 cells. The percentage
of CD44+/CD133+ cells in this sorted population could
be maintained around 95%. The high levels of CD44 and
CD133 in HCT116 CD44+/CD133+ and HCT8 CD44+/

Bioinformatic approaches have identified multiple
mRNAs as direct targets of miR-139-5p. Among the
predicted targets, we chose to further investigate NOTCH1
because of its importance in tumorigenesis, tumor
progression [22, 23] and stem cell maintenance [24].
MiRNA target searches with Targetscan and Miranda
confirmed that NOTCH1 has a putative miR-139-5p
binding site within its 3′-UTR (Figure 4A). To investigate
whether miR-139-5p could up- or downregulate NOTCH1,
we assessed NOTCH1 mRNA and protein expression in
miR-139-5p mimic-transfected cells. MiR-139-5p mimics
significantly suppressed NOTCH1 mRNA and protein

expression (Figure 4B). These results suggested that miR139-5p may downregulate NOTCH1 expression at both the
transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
To investigate the possible interaction between
miR-139-5p and NOTCH1, we introduced mutations into
the putative miR-139-5a binding sites in the NOTCH1

3′-UTR, generated luciferase reporter constructs with the
wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) 3′-UTRs of NOTCH1,
and co-transfected these constructs into CD44+/CD133+
cells with the miR-139-5a mimics or control vectors. The
ectopic expression of miR-139-5a significantly reduced
the luciferase activity of the WT NOTCH1 3′-UTR, but

(Figure 4C).
We further validated the association between
miR-139-5p and NOTCH1 expression in 66 CRC
specimens, and found that high miR-139-5p expression
was always associated with low NOTCH1 expression.
A Pearson Chi-square test confirmed that miR-139-5p
expression inversely correlated with NOTCH1 expression
(p < 0.001) (Figure 4D). Importantly, tumors from miR139-5p knockout mice exhibited stronger Notch1 staining
than those from control mice (Figure 4E). These results
suggested that NOTCH1 is indeed a target of miR-139-5p.

CD133+-associated MDR, we first compared miR-139-5p
and NOTCH1 expression in CD44+/CD133+ cells and
their parental cells. As shown in Figures 3A and 5A, miR139-5p expression was significantly lower, and NOTCH1
protein expression was greater, in CD44+/CD133+ cells
than in parental cells.
We then transfected miR-139-5p mimics or
NOTCH1 siRNA into drug-resistant or CD44+/CD133+
cells. A CCK-8 assay demonstrated that NOTCH1 siRNA
treatment reversed CD44+/CD133+-associated MDR, with
the same efficiency as miR-139-5p treatment (Figure 5B).
These results suggested that miR-139-5p reverses CD44+/
CD133+-associated MDR by downregulating NOTCH1.
To further investigate the efficiency of miR-139-5p
mimics and NOTCH1 siRNA in destroying CSCs, we
quantified the number of cells with the CSC markers
(CD44 and CD133) by flow cytometry. Seventy-two
hours after transfection, the percentage of CD44+ and
CD133+ cells had significantly decreased in both the
miR-139-5p mimic group and the NOTCH1 siRNA group
(Figure 5C and 5D). Our data confirmed that miR-139-5p
reversed the CD44+/CD133+-associated MDR, at least
partly, by downregulating NOTCH1.

MiR-139-5p reverses CD44+/CD133+associated MDR, partly by downregulating

The presence of CSCs is one of the most important
reasons for MDR [25–27]. As NOTCH1 promotes
the maintenance of CSCs, we hypothesized that
miR-139-5p
reverses
CD44+/CD133+-associated
MDR by downregulating NOTCH1. To examine the
involvement of miR-139-5p/NOTCH1 in CD44+/

DISCUSSION

miR-139-5p overexpression (Figure 6B and 6C). An
in vivo study also demonstrated that overexpression of
NOTCH1 ablated the inhibitory effects of miR-139-5p
on tumor growth (Figure 6D). All these results provided
further evidence that NOTCH1 expression is inhibited by
miR-139-5p, and that the downregulation of miR-139-5p
is a key promoter of CD44+/CD133+-associated colorectal
drug resistance because it potentiates NOTCH1 expression.

Even when CRC is diagnosed early and treated with
advanced surgical strategies, a considerable proportion
of CRC patients develop recurrence or metastasis within
5 years of surgical treatment [28]. In many cases of tumor
recurrence, the cancer cells are resistant to conventional
chemotherapy. CSCs are postulated to be important

promoters of MDR [29]. Although medicines such as
5-FU and L-OHP are available for CRC treatment, drug
resistance limits their clinical application.
Considering the clinical significance of drug
resistance and the ineffectiveness of chemotherapy in
removing CSCs, we evaluated the correlation of chemoresistance with the CSC phenotype. Consistent with
reports that chemo-resistant CRC cells are enriched for
CSCs, we discovered that the expression of CD44 and
CD133 increased in drug-resistant cells.
NOTCH1, as the target gene of miR-139-5p, has key
functions in miR-139-5p- induced cell migration, invasion
[30], apoptosis and drug re-sensitization [31]. We further
confirmed that NOTCH1 is a direct target of miR-139-5p
in CRC cells, and showed that miR-139-5p suppresses
tumor growth by downregulating NOTCH1 expression.
Notch signaling has also been suggested to determine
cell fate, for instance, by promoting the self-renewal of
stem cells and cell differentiation [32]. Furthermore, the
Notch pathway is a key promoter of cell survival and cell
proliferation. Dysregulated expression of Notch receptors
has been found in different neoplastic lesions, indicating
that Notch may act as an oncogene [33]. High expression
of NOTCH1 is related to poorer overall survival in
patients. NOTCH1 is also regarded as a diagnostic and
prognostic biomarker in clinical diagnosis and treatment.
Our study first found that miR-139-5p reversed
CD44+/CD133+-associated
MDR,
partly
by
downregulating NOTCH1 in vitro. Compared with the
parental cells, higher expression of NOTCH1 was found
in drug-resistant or CD44+/CD133+ cells, which expressed
lower levels of miR-139-5p (Figure 5A). Overexpression
of miR-139-5p increased drug sensitivity and suppressed
the CD44+/CD133+ population in drug-resistant and
CD44+/CD133+ cells by downregulating NOTCH1. In
CRC samples and miR139-5p knockout mice, miR-139-5p
expression inversely correlated with NOTCH1 expression.
This suggested that miR-139-5p downregulation promotes
CD44+/CD133+-associated colorectal drug resistance by
disinhibiting NOTCH1.
This deeper study of miR-139-5p has expanded our
understanding of CRC. MiR-139-5p could be a clinically
feasible target for drug design, either if a single stimulatory
agent is developed specifically for miR-139-5p,
or if treatments targeting miR-139-5p are combined
with classical chemotherapeutic drugs. Such therapies
could enhance chemosensitivity by directly or indirectly
reducing the expression of resistance-associated proteins,
as well as by inhibiting the cell cycle and promoting
apoptosis in CRC cells.
Biological characterization of colorectal CSCs may
help clinicians reduce tumor recurrence and improve the
diagnosis and treatment of CRC. Since the first description
of CSCs, significant advances have been made in our
understanding of their function in hematopoietic and solid
tumors - they are now known to contribute significantly
to tumorigenesis and the recurrence of malignancies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by causing drug resistance and promoting cancer
progression. Therefore, suppressing CSCs is an efficient
therapeutic method for treating various cancers. In this
study, we investigated the function of miRNA in CSCs,
and found that the downregulation of miR-139-5p caused
drug resistance and cancer progression. Thus, our data
are applicable to the development of novel therapeutic
strategies to stimulate or inhibit miRNAs in CSCs to better
treat cancer patients.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated
that in CD44+/ CD133+ CSC-like cells, miR-139-5p
could reverse MDR by downregulating NOTCH1. These
findings suggest the potential feasibility of miR-139-5p as
a biomarker and novel anti-cancer drug target, and provide
a full-scale theoretical basis and new strategy for CRC
diagnosis, targeted therapy and prognosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and plasmids
Human CRC cell lines (HCT116, HCT8) were
purchased from the Cell Bank of the Type Culture Collection
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). All
cells were cultured in a monolayer at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air in Rosewell Park
Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. The plasmid used in the
experiments was designed as previously reported [17].
Transfection of the cells was performed with Lipofectamine™
2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Patient samples
Human CRC samples and corresponding
nontumorous colorectal samples were collected at the
time of surgical resection from consenting patients, with
ethical approval from the research ethics committees of
Putuo Hospital. Samples were immediately snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The experiments were
conducted with the understanding and written consent of
each subject, and the study methodologies accorded with
the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki.

RNA purification and qRT-PCR analyses
Total RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen
Corporation, Carlsbad, California, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was
performed with a One Step PrimeScript miRNA cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Dalian, China). qRT-PCR
was performed with a miR-139-5p MiRNA TaqMan Assay
(Applied Biosystems) on an iCycler thermal cycler (BioRad, Hercules, USA). U6 RNA was used as a miRNA
internal control. The primer used for qRT-PCR for miR139-5p was: 5′-TCT ACA GTG CAC GTG TCT CCA G-3′.

Proliferation assays

For cell cycle analysis, the harvested cells were
suspended in chilled PBS, fixed with cold 70% ethanol
and incubated at 4°C for 10 minutes. Then, cells were
incubated with 50 µL RNase for 30 min at 37°C. Finally,
cells were incubated with propidium iodide for 10 min
in the dark at 4°C. The cell cycle distribution was then
examined by flow cytometry.

The proliferation of cells was evaluated with
the CCK-8 assay (Kumamoto, Japan) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were plated in
96-well plates at a density of 2 × 103 cells/well. Cells
were transfected with miRNA mimics 24 h later, and
were cultured for 48 h before the addition of 10 mL of
CCK-8 to each well. After another 4 h of incubation at
37OC, the optical density of each well was examined
with a Thermomax Microplate Reader at 450 nm. Each
experiment was performed three times.

Subcutaneous xenografts
For subcutaneous xenografts, the experiment was
performed as previously described [17].

Colony formation assay

Mouse model

Cells (0.5 × 103) were seeded into a six-well plate
and cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C for 14 days.
All samples were washed with PBS, fixed in 75% ethanol,
stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and counted.

Predicted target sites of miR-139-5p in NOTCH1
were cloned into the Xho I and Not I sites of the psiCheck2
Luciferase vector, as were the mutated miR-139-5p target
sites. Cells were co-transfected with 50 ng of psiCheck2NOTCH1-WT or psiCheck2-NOTCH1-Mut constructs
and miR-139-5p mimics or negative control mimics.
Luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-transfection
with a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega
Corporation, WI, USA). Firefly luciferase activity was
normalized to renilla luciferase activity in each transfected
well. Three independent experiments were undertaken in
triplicate and independently repeated at least twice.

MiR-139-5p knockout mice and littermate controls,
all on the C57BL/6 background, were originally purchased
from the Genetically Modified Animal Center (East China
Normal University at Shanghai). The miR-139-5p gene
was knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 in the whole body as
described previously [35]. MiR-139-5p knockout mice
were then backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background for
10 generations. All mice were 6–8 weeks old and bred
in-house to generate comparable groups.
Colitis-associated tumorigenesis was induced
according to a previously reported protocol [36]. Briefly,
mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg
azoxymethane (Sigma–Aldrich), and were treated 5 days
later with 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium in their drinking
water for 7 days, followed by 14 days of regular water.
After two additional cycles of this treatment, the mice
were sacrificed at the end of the DSS cycle. Body weights
were recorded daily. Mice were sacrificed at the indicated
time intervals, and the numbers and sizes of tumors were
measured in a blinded fashion.

Western blot analysis

Histological analysis

Cellular proteins were extracted and separated
on SDS/PAGE gels, and Western blot analyses were
performed according to standard procedures, as previously
described [34]. β-actin was used as a loading control.

Paraffin-embedded colorectal tissues were
longitudinally cut into 4-m sections and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin solution. Immunohistochemical
staining was performed as described previously [37].
A NOTCH1 rabbit anti-human antibody was used at a
dilution of 1:100 (Epitomics, USA); PBS was used as a
negative control. Every section was evaluated and scored
independently by two pathologists. A semi-quantitative
scoring system was used in this trial [37, 38].

Luciferase assay to validate predicted binding
sites

Flow cytometry
For apoptosis, an Annexin V-FITC apoptosis
detection kit (Invitrogen, USA) was used according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. For cell sorting, after
non-specific binding was excluded, approximately 1×106
cells were labeled with conjugated anti-human CD133PE (eBioscience, USA) and anti-human CD44-FITC
(eBioscience, USA). Cells were resuspended in PBS
buffer with 2% FBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell
sorting was conducted under sterile conditions, and the
sorted cells were cultured as described above.
