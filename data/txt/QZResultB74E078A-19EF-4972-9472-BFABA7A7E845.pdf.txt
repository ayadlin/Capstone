Abstract

Author Manuscript

Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species are found in most oncogenically transformed cells and
are proposed to promote cellular transformation through mechanisms such as inhibition of
phosphatases. BCR-ABL, the oncoprotein associated with the majority of chronic myelogenous
leukemias, induces accumulation of intracellular ROS causing enhanced signaling downstream of
PI3K. Previously we have shown that the transcription factor NF-κB is activated by BCR-ABL
expression and is required for BCR-ABL-mediated cellular transformation. Inhibition of IKKβ and
NF-κB leads to cell death through an unknown mechanism. Here, we analyze the potential
involvement of NF-κB in moderating BCR-ABL-induced ROS levels to protect from death in
response to cell stress. The data confirm that BCR-ABL promotes ROS levels and demonstrate
that NF-κB prevents excessive ROS levels. Inhibition of NF-κB leads to an increase in ROS levels
and to cell death controlled through ROS-induced JNK activity. The data demonstrate that one
function for NF-κB in oncogenesis is the suppression of oncoprotein-induced ROS levels and that
inhibition of NF-κB in some cancers, including CML, will increase ROS levels and promote cell
death.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Chronic myeloid leukemia is a malignant clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells that
results in increased and deregulated growth of myeloid cells (Sawyers, 1999).
Approximately 95% of CML cases arise from the formation of the Philadelphia (Ph)
chromosome, a product of a chromosomal translocation that brings together the c-abl gene
on chromosome 9 and the bcr gene on chromosome 22. This translocation results in the
creation of the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase
(Sawyers, 1999). As a consequence of increased tyrosine kinase activity, BCR-ABL
phosphorylates substrates including Grb2, Crkl and Shc, and activates signaling cascades,
such as the Ras pathway, PI3K/Akt and Stat5, affecting the growth and differentiation of
myeloid cells (Diaz-Blanco et al., 2007).

NF-κB is a transcription factor comprised of five family members: p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel,
p50/p105 (NF-κB1) and p52/p100 (NF-κB2). These proteins share a conserved Rel
homology domain, which controls DNA binding, dimerization and interaction with
inhibitory IκB proteins (Bassères and Baldwin, 2006; Courtois and Gilmore, 2006). NF-κB
activation typically occurs through one of two distinct pathways. In the classical pathway,
the p50-p65(RelA) heterodimer is activated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which
contains two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ. IKK
phosphorylates IκBα, an inhibitory protein that normally sequesters p50-p65 in the
cytoplasm, causing it to become ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded, allowing NF-κB
to accumulate in the nucleus. In the alternative pathway, IKKα homodimers are activated
and subsequently phosphorylate p100. This results in the proteolytic processing of p100 to
p52 and allows p52-RelB dimers to translocate to the nucleus (Hayden and Ghosh, 2004).
Once in the nucleus, NF-κB is known to regulate the expression of a variety of genes,
including those encoding cytokines and cytokine receptors, inflammatory mediators, and
antiapoptotic proteins (Bassères and Baldwin, 2006).
NF-κB is activated in many solid tumors (Basséres and Baldwin, 2006) and hematologic
malignancies, including CML (Braun et al., 2006), where it provides proliferative and cell
survival mechanisms. NF-κB is activated by BCR-ABL and is required for cellular
transformation and tumor formation induced by this oncoprotein (Hamdane et al., 1997;
Reuther et al. 1998). Inhibition of IKK in BCR-ABL-expressing cells induces death (Cilloni
et al., 2006; Duncan et al., 2008). Interestingly, Imatinib- and/or Dasatinib-resistant cells
were shown to be susceptible to IKKβ inhibition (Duncan et al, 2008), suggesting a novel
therapeutic option for CML. However, the mechanism whereby IKKβ inhibition induces
death of BCR-ABL-expressing cells has not been determined.

c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), is a
member of the MAPK family and is involved in the regulation of c-jun, a component of the
AP-1 family of transcription factors (Leppä and Bohmann, 1999). JNK is predominately
activated by cellular stress mechanisms, including increased levels of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), but can also be activated by other stimuli including cytokines and oncogenic
transformation. JNK is actived by MAPKKs through the phosphorylation of threonine 183
and tyrosine 185. JNK then phosphorylates c-Jun at serines 63 and 73 causing an increase in
c-Jun transcriptional activity (Gupta et al., 1996). c-Jun activity is implicated in cell
transformation, proliferation and death downstream of JNK (Leppä and Bohmann, 1999;
Vogt, 2001). Interestingly, both c-jun and JNK are required for transformation of
hematopoietic cells by BCR-ABL (Raitano et al., 1995) as well as their survival after
transformation (Hess et al., 2002). However, under stimuli that induce cell stress, JNK
activation can lead to death (Shen and Liu, 2006; Dhanasekaran and Reddy, 2008). JNK
becomes activated by stimuli in a constitutive manner through increased intracellular ROS
and activates apoptotic and necrotic death pathways (Tang et al, 2002; Pham et al, 2004;
Ventura et al., 2004; Kamata et al, 2005).
It has been demonstrated that oncogenic transformation results in increased levels of
intracellular ROS, which are used as secondary signaling molecules to increase proliferation
and to promote the oncogenic potential of transformed cells (Pelicano et al., 2004; Benhar et

al., 2002). For example, oncogenic Ras leads to increased levels of ROS, which are
important in oncogenic transformation and proliferation (Irani et al., 1997). Previous reports
have shown that hematopoietic cell lines transformed with BCR-ABL have increased levels
of intracellular ROS (Sattler et al, 2000; Kim et al, 2005; Naughton et al., 2009). ROS
promotes PI3K-induced signaling downstream of BCR-ABL by inhibiting phosphatases
which normally limit signal transduction cascades (Naughton et al., 2009), thereby
increasing tumorigenicity.

Here we have explored the potential involvement of NF-κB in moderating intracellular ROS
levels downstream of BCR-ABL. The results indicate that NF-κB activity functions to
suppress BCR-ABL-induced ROS levels. Additionally, inhibition of IKK or NF-κB leads to
enhanced ROS levels and elevated JNK activity to promote cell death. The experiments
reveal a key pro-oncogenic mechanism and demonstrate a mechanism whereby inhibition of
NF-κB activity promotes cytotoxicity of certain cancer cells.

Results
Inhibition of IKKβ results in apoptosis of BCR-ABL-expressing cells

Author Manuscript

Recently, we and others have shown that IKKβ activity is required for survival of BCRABL-expressing myeloid cells, including cells with mutations resistant to the commonly
used BCR-ABL inhibitors Imatinib and Dasatinib (Duncan et al., 2008, Cilloni et al., 2006).
That data showed the importance of IKKβ in BCR-ABL-induced oncogenesis. However a
mechanism mediating IKK inhibitor-induced cell death and involvement of NF-κB in cell
survival was not shown. As analyzed before, cell viability was measured to determine the
effect of IKKβ inhibition using Compound A (a well validated IKKβ inhibitor, Ziegelbauer
et al., 2005) in parental 32D cells and in 32D cells stably expressing BCR-ABL p185 (32D/
p185). Compound A treatment resulted in decreased cell viability similar to treatment with
Imatinib, while Compound C, an inactive analog of Compound A, did not affect the viability

of 32D/p185 cells (Fig. 1A and see Duncan et al., 2008). The decrease in cell viability with
Compound A treatment corresponds with cleavage of caspase 3, a marker of apoptosis (Fig.
1B). Similar results were seen in parental BaF3 pro-B cells and BaF3 cells expressing BCRABL (Fig. S1). Co-incubation with ZVAD-FMK, an inhibitor of caspase activation, potently
blocks Compound A-induced cell death. These results show that IKKβ activity is required to
block apoptosis in cells expressing BCR-ABL (Fig. 1B and Duncan et al, 2008).
NF-κB activity is required for the survival of BCR-ABL-expressing cells

Author Manuscript

Although IKKβ is known to activate NF-κB through the phosphorylation-mediated
ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα, it also has other targets (Hu et al., 2004; Lee et al.,
2007). Therefore, to determine if NF-κB is necessary for the survival of BCR-ABLexpressing cells downstream of IKKβ, and to rule out off target effects of Compound A, NFκB activity was blocked by expressing IκBα super-repressor (IκBα-SR), a form of IκBα
containing serine to alanine mutations at residues 32 and 36 that prevent its phosphorylation
and degradation, thereby sequestering NF-κB in the cytoplasm of the cell. Expression of
IκBα-SR led to apoptosis in BCR-ABL-expressing 32D cells over time as measured by
Annexin V/PI staining (Fig. 2A) and expression of cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 2B) while the
viability of cells transduced with empty vector were not affected. Taken together, these
results show a requirement for NF-κB activity downstream of IKKβ in hematopoietic cells
expressing BCR-ABL to prevent apoptosis.
IKKβ inhibition in BCR-ABL-expressing cells results in the accumulation of intracellular
oxygen species

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

While the inhibition of both IKKβ and NF-κB in BCR-ABL-expressing cells results in
apoptosis, the mechanism that precedes cell death remains unclear. Cells that have
undergone oncogenic transformation, including those overexpressing Ras, c-myc and BCRABL, have increased levels of intracellular ROS (Irani et al., 1997, Vafa et al. 2002, Sattler
et al., 2000). Transformed cells utilize increased ROS as secondary signaling molecules to
enhance proliferation and tumor development. However, because transformed cells harbor
higher levels of ROS, a further increase in free radicals can result in apoptosis or necrosis
(Pelicano et al, 2004). As BCR-ABL expression is known to enhance reactive oxygen
species production in hematopoietic cells (Sattler et al, 2000; Kim et al, 2005; Naughton et
al, 2009) and NF-κB can regulate antioxidant gene expression (Tang et al, 2002; Pham et al,
2004; Kamata et al, 2005), we asked if IKKβ inhibition with Compound A results in altered
ROS levels leading to cell death. Relative ROS levels were measured in 32D/p185 cells
treated with Imatinib or Compound A over time. Treatment with the BCR-ABL inhibitor
Imatinib decreased intracellular ROS levels (Fig. 3A) as previously reported (Sattler et al.,
2000), while IKKβ inhibition using Compound A caused an increase in intracellular ROS as
measured by DCF-DA staining. Cells treated for 12 to 16 hours showed an accumulation of
ROS (Fig. 3) while cells treated for 1 hour did not (data not shown), suggesting that an
indirect mechanism leads to the accumulation of ROS in these cells. The accumulation of
ROS upon treatment with Compound A is reversed through the addition of antioxidants nacetyl-cysteine (NAC) or butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) (Fig. 3B). These data indicate
that IKKβ inhibition leads to significantly enhanced levels of ROS, over those induced by
BCR-ABL.

NF-κB inhibits the activation of JNK downstream of BCR-ABL to promote cell survival

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

At high levels, ROS have been shown to activate AP-1, resulting in cell death (Shen and
Liu, 2006). Interestingly, NF-κB is important for the regulation of JNK, an upstream
effector of AP-1, to block death under cell stress conditions (Tang et al., 2002; Pham et al,
2004; Kamata et al, 2005). Given the correlation between increased intracellular ROS and
apoptosis in BCR-ABL-expressing cells after Compound A treatment, we asked if NF-κB
activation is important for the regulation of intracellular ROS and inhibition of JNK
downstream of BCR-ABL. A time course in which 32D/p185 cells were treated with
Compound A shows that both the phosphorylation of JNK, its downstream target c-jun, and
caspase-3 cleavage occur 6 hours after treatment (Fig. 4A). 32D/p185 cells were transduced
with empty vector or IκBα-SR to examine the effect of NF-κB inhibition on JNK activation
and apoptosis downstream of BCR-ABL. Cells harvested 36 hours post-transduction showed
increased phosphorylation of JNK, c-jun and the cleavage of caspase 3 (Fig. 4B). Parental
32D cells expressing IκBα-SR were not affected to the same extent as 32D/p185 cells,
although some apoptosis is apparent as measured by cleavage of caspase 3 (Fig. 4C). This
low level of cell death can be attributed to moderate activation of NF-κB in these cells due
to their dependence on IL-3 for survival (Reuther et al., 1998). While IL-3 is also known to
activate JNK (Yu et al., 2004), expression of IκBα-SR did affect JNK phosphorylation in
these cells. Together, these data show that NF-κB actively regulates the level of intracellular
ROS and also inhibits the activation of JNK downstream of BCR-ABL to inhibit cells from
undergoing apoptosis.
IKKβ inhibition leads to downregulation of transcription of antioxidant genes

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our results show that NF-κB activity is important for the regulation of intracellular ROS and
JNK activity downstream of BCR-ABL to prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis. NF-κB
is known to regulate the expression of genes encoding proteins with antioxidant properties
(Kamata et al., 2005; Pham et al, 2004). Due to the increase in intracellular ROS upon
inhibition of IKKβ, we asked if NF-κB transcriptionally regulates genes known to clear
excess ROS from the cell. BCR-ABL-expressing cells were treated with vehicle or
Compound A and quantitative real-time PCR was used to screen NF-κB target genes known
to have antioxidant properties. 32D/p185 cells treated with Compound A for 12 hours
showed decreased levels of both Sod2 and Fth1 mRNAs (Fig. 5A), corresponding with the
phosphorylation of JNK and apoptosis (Fig. 4A). This result indicates that blocking IKKβ
activity results in decreased production of two known ROS scavengers, possibly resulting in
accumulation of intracellular ROS and apoptosis. To rule out potential off target effects of
Compound A, IκBα-SR was overexpressed to block NF-κB activity in 32D/p185 cells.
Similar to the results obtained using Compound A treatment, cells expressing IκBα-SR (Fig.
5C) also showed decreased mRNA levels of Sod2 and Fth1 (Fig. 5B), correlating with
apoptosis as measured by cleavage of caspase 3. Overexpression of Sod2 and Fth1 did not
rescue the cell death response induced by IKKβ inhibition (data not shown), suggesting that
multiple mechanisms controlled by IKK and NF-κB contribute to the control of ROS levels
in oncogenically transformed cells.

JNK inhibition rescues BCR-ABL+ cells from apoptosis after Compound A treatment

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our results show that NF-κB activity regulates intracellular ROS levels and JNK activation
in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. To determine the importance of JNK activity in the death of
BCR-ABL-expressing cells after inhibition of NF-κB, we blocked JNK using a specific
inhibitor, SP600125, and treated 32D/p185 cells with Compound A. Cells that were treated
with SP600125 and Compound A showed decreased apoptosis as indicated by caspase 3
cleavage (Fig. 6A) and FACS analysis (Fig. 6B). However, cells treated with high
concentrations of SP600125 (≥25μM) underwent apoptosis without IKKβ inhibition,
indicating that BCR-ABL-expressing cells also require low levels of JNK activity for
survival as previously shown (Raitano et al, 1995; Hess et al., 2002). Similar results were
obtained from 32D/p185 cells that were treated with SP600125 upon expression of IκBα-SR
(Fig. 6C). These data show that increased JNK activity is required for cell death in BCRABL-expressing cells when NF-κB is inhibited. These data further suggest an important role
for JNK regulation and evasion of apoptosis by NF-κB downstream of BCR-ABL.
Inhibition of ROS prevents death due to IKKβ inhibition in BCR-ABL+ cells

Author Manuscript

The increase in intracellular ROS in transformed cells enhances proliferation and
tumorigenicity. However, these cells are also sensitive to further increases in intracellular
ROS, which may lead to apoptosis (Pelicano et al, 2004). Our data show that inhibition of
NF-κB leads to a further increase in intracellular ROS, activation of JNK and apoptosis
downstream of BCR-ABL. To better understand the role of NF-κB in the regulation of
intracellular ROS in cells expressing BCR-ABL, we inhibited ROS and measured cell death
after Compound A treatment. Interestingly, 32D/p185 cells incubated with n-acetyl-cysteine
(NAC) or butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) in conjunction with Compound A treatment
showed a pronounced decrease in phosphorylated JNK and were resistant to apoptosis (Fig.
7A and 7B). Similar results were obtained in Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL (Fig. S2).
Cells were also coincubated with bovine catalase and Compound A, resulting in decreased
JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis (Fig. 7C). Lastly, 32D/p185 cells were incubated with
NAC upon expression of IκBα-SR as determined by GFP expression. JNK activation and
apoptosis induced by the overexpression of IκBα-SR were also inhibited by NAC treatment
(Fig. 7D). These results show that NF-κB activity is required to regulate increased
intracellular ROS following transformation with BCR-ABL. Upon inhibition of NF-κB, the
accumulation of ROS in the cell leads to the activation of JNK and apoptosis (Fig. 7E).

Discussion
Author Manuscript

Increased ROS has been documented in several cell types after oncogenic transformation
and in various cancers (Benhar et al., 2002, Pelicano et al., 2004). It was first discovered that
human tumor cells produce increased amounts of hydrogen peroxide (Szatrowski and
Nathan, 1991), leading to the hypothesis that cancer cells are subject to persistent oxidative
stress, possibly explaining characteristics of cancer including genomic instability and
increased proliferation (Toyokuni et al., 1995). Indeed, several reports have shown an
increase in reactive oxygen species in primary human tumors, including brain (Iida et al.,
2001), colorectal carcinoma (Toyokuni et al., 1999), and ovarian cancer (Senthil et al.,
2004). Additionally, reports showed that oncogenic transformation by Ras, c-myc and BCR-

ABL lead to increased ROS which important for increased proliferation and tumorigenic
potential (Irani et al., 1997; Felsher et al., 1999; Vafa et al., 2002, Sattler et al., 2000; Kim et
al, 2005; Naughton et al, 2009).

Author Manuscript

Relative to oncogenic Ras expression, increased ROS levels were shown to be required for
cellular transformation (Irani et al., 1997). In this regard, ROS generated from the Qo site of
mitochondrial complex III is required for anchorage-independent growth of Ras-transformed
cells (Weinberg et al, 2010). Overexpression of Nox1, a superoxide generator, in NIH3T3
results in elevated production of ROS and a transformed phenotype with increased
proliferation (Suh et al., 1999). Interestingly, Nox1 knockdown blocks Ras-transformed
phenotypes including anchorage independent growth in vitro and in vivo (Mitsushita et al.,
2004). Relative to our study, ROS levels are increased downstream of BCR-ABL which
leads to increased PI3K/Akt-dependent signaling through inhibition of the phosphatase PP1a
(Naughton et al., 2009).
Cells transformed with BCR-ABL have increased ROS (Sattler et al, 2000; Kim et al, 2005;
Naughton et al, 2009) (and see Fig. 3A ) thus increasing the sensitivity of these cells to a
further increase in ROS. Treatment with agents that cause an increase in ROS in BCR-ABLexpressing cells causes to death (Zhou et al, 2003; Chandra et al., 2006; Trachootham et al.,
2006; Zhang et al., 2008; Mao et al, 2010). One such agent, phenethyl isothiocyanate
(PEITC) results in increased ROS and subsequent apoptosis in cells expressing both wildtype (Trachootham et al., 2006) and Imatinib- and Dasatinib-resistant (Zhang et al., 2008)
forms of BCR-ABL. However, the mechanism by which these compounds cause increased
ROS and cell death is largely unknown.

Author Manuscript

Data described above indicate that the maintenance of moderate levels of ROS are necessary
for increased proliferative capacity and tumorigenic potential while avoiding death in
response to excessive accumulation of free radicals (Schimmel and Bauer., 2002; Benhar et
al., 2002; Pelicano et al., 2004). Due to excessive strain on ROS clearing mechanisms that
maintain a moderate balance of ROS, a further increase in ROS in transformed cells may
result in cancer cell death (Benhar et al., 2002; Pelicano et al. 2004), offering a novel
approach to target cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

Potential therapeutic targets to increase ROS specifically in cancer cells include
transcription factors that control the expression of both antiapoptotic and antioxidant genes.
One such transcription factor, NF-κB, has been shown to regulate the transcription of genes
with antioxidant properties, such as ferritin heavy chain (Pham et al., 2004) and superoxide
dismutates (Kamata et al., 2005). NF-κB also inhibits JNK activation downstream of ROS
through transcription of genes such as Gadd45 (De Smaele et al., 2001) and XIAP (Tang et
al., 2001) and through the inhibition of MAPK (Kamata et al., 2005) and tyrosine
phosphatases (Sattler et al., 2000).
Our results show an important role for NF-κB activity in the maintenance of intracellular
ROS and the inhibition of JNK activity downstream of BCR-ABL to prevent cell death after
oncogenic transformation. Inhibition of IKKβ using a chemical inhibitor, Compound A,
results in apoptosis (Fig. 1), along with the accumulation of intracellular ROS and the

activation of JNK in BCR-ABL-expressing cells (Fig. 3). Likewise, expression of IκBα-SR,
which blocks NF-κB activity, induces JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis (Fig. 4B). These
data correlate with previous reports in which NF-κB plays an important role in JNK
inhibition when ROS levels increase (Sakon et al., 2003; Pham et al., 2004; Kamata et al.,
2005).

Author Manuscript

Treatment with Compound A or expression of IκBα-SR also results in decreased expression
of two NF-κB target genes with antioxidant properties, Fth1 and Sod2 (Fig. 5). These genes
have been documented in response to TNFα stimulation in which TNFα-induced ROS was
scavenged thereby protecting cells from TNFα induced death in the absence of NF-κB
(Pham et al., 2004, Kamata et al., 2005). While inhibition of NF-κB results in decreased
antioxidant gene expression (Fth1 and Sod2), our preliminary data indicates that
overexpression of either FTH1 or SOD2 in BCR-ABL-expressing cells is not sufficient to
inhibit apoptosis in the absence of NF-κB activity. This is not surprising, as many cellular
processes control the levels of ROS, indicating that other NF-κB-dependent genes and
buffering systems are likely involved in this process.

Author Manuscript

Our data also show that JNK activity is involved in the initiation of apoptosis in the absence
of NF-κB. Blocking JNK activity with a chemical inhibitor, SP600125, results in a decrease
in cell death upon Compound A treatment downstream of BCR-ABL (Fig. 6). However,
cells expressing BCR-ABL appear to require JNK activity, as the inhibitor alone results in
induction of apoptosis in 32D/p185 cells. Importantly, JNK activation by ROS is required
for the initiation of apoptosis in the absence of NF-κB activity (Fig. 7). However, inhibition
of ROS with antioxidants offers more complete protection from Compound A-induced
apoptosis that inhibition of JNK with SP600125. This could simply be due to the efficiency
of inhibition by these compounds, or the differences in survival could indicate a more
involved role for increased ROS in apoptosis after inhibition of NF-κB. It is probable that
ROS activate JNK as well as other proteins in the cell to initiate apoptosis in response to
unfavorable conditions, and that inhibiting JNK only partially blocks the effect of increased
ROS on cell survival.
These data show that NF-κB is required to maintain moderate levels of ROS and inhibit
JNK activation downstream of BCR-ABL-induced ROS to inhibit the induction of apoptosis
in a model of chronic myeloid leukemia. As increased ROS is common among transformed
cells, it is likely that NF-κB plays an essential role in the regulation of ROS to prevent
death, illustrating the potential use for IKKβ inhibitors as a therapeutic in CML and possibly
other cancers.
