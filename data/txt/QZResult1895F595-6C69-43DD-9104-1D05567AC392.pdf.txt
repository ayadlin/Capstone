ABSTRACT
Analysis of cell-free DNA using next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful
tool for the detection/monitoring of alterations present in circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA). Plasma extracted from 171 patients with a variety of cancers was analyzed
for ctDNA (54 genes and copy number variants (CNVs) in three genes (EGFR,
ERBB2 and MET)). The most represented cancers were lung (23%), breast (23%),
and glioblastoma (19%). Ninety-nine patients (58%) had at least one detectable
alteration. The most frequent alterations were TP53 (29.8%), followed by EGFR
(17.5%), MET (10.5%), PIK3CA (7%), and NOTCH1 (5.8%). In contrast, of 222
healthy volunteers, only one had an aberration (TP53). Ninety patients with nonbrain tumors had a discernible aberration (65% of 138 patients; in 70% of nonbrain tumor patients with an alteration, the anomaly was potentially actionable).
Interestingly, nine of 33 patients (27%) with glioblastoma had an alteration (6/33
(18%) potentially actionable). Overall, sixty-nine patients had potentially actionable
alterations (40% of total; 69.7% of patients (69/99) with alterations); 68 patients
(40% of total; 69% of patients with alterations), by a Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved drug. In summary, 65% of diverse cancers (as well as 27% of
glioblastomas) had detectable ctDNA aberration(s), with the majority theoretically
actionable by an approved agent.

not provide a recent picture of the molecular background
of the tumor. In addition, patients with metastatic disease
often have multiple involved sites, but usually have only
one tumor biopsied and interrogated. While the testing
might provide information about the genomic landscape
of this particular site, it may not reflect the full genomic
make-up of the cancer, as it has been shown that metastatic
disease exhibits considerable heterogeneity [13–15].
Furthermore, it has been established that the portfolio of
alterations found in tumors evolve with time. For instance,
patients with non-small cell lung cancers treated with an
EGFR inhibitor to target an EGFR mutation nearly always
develop resistance, due to secondary mutations [16–18].
Therefore, molecular assays that detect these genomic
changes without repeat invasive tissue biopsies are
needed. One approach that could be useful is to investigate
circulating tumor cell DNA (cell-free DNA) shed into the

INTRODUCTION
The detection and investigation of molecular
alterations has increased our knowledge of oncogenic
mechanisms, and led to the use of targeted cancer therapies
matched to patients’ specific molecular aberrations [1–7].
Specific examples include the use of EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
with an EGFR mutation [8], BRAF inhibitors in melanoma
harboring BRAF mutations [9,10], or imatinib for chronic
myelogenous leukemia [11,12]. Currently, most of the
molecular tests are performed on archived tissues at a
single time point, which is often a limiting factor. These
invasive biopsies involve risks for patients, they are costly,
time consuming, and may pose related complications of
tissue acquisition. Samples used for testing are often from
archived tissue that is several months old [1,2], which may

circulation or released when cancer cells die [19]. This
technology has emerged rapidly, with detection of the
small amounts of tumor DNA present in the blood being
virtually impossible even a few years ago. More recently,
circulating cell-free tumor DNA has been successfully
analyzed for single gene aberrations [20–22]. Cell-free
DNA assays analyzing complete exons in multiple genes
via next-generation sequencing (NGS) are now becoming
feasible. Here we report the results of liquid biopsies in
171 patients whose blood was analyzed for 54 genes via
NGS in circulating tumor, cell-free DNA.

(9/33 of glioblastoma cases). Specifically, 26% of patients
had one alteration, and 32% had at least two alterations.
Patients had a median of one alteration (average 1.4,
range 0-19), Figure 2A. Gastrointestinal, lung, breast,
and genitourinary cancers harbored the most alterations,
with 83%, 60%, 45%, and 40% of cases bearing at
least two alterations, respectively. Interestingly, while
the majority of patients with glioblastoma (73%) did
not harbor a discernible alteration, 27% (N=9/33) had
an alteration (Figure 2B), most commonly TP53 and
NOTCH1 anomalies (detected in four and three patients,
respectively).
When examining the tumor types comprising the
most patients (lung and breast cancers, each n=40), we
found that the most frequent alterations reported were
TP53 (32.5%), HER1/2 (27.5%), and PIK3CA (25%) in
breast cancer cases (Figure 3A). In lung cancer cases,
TP53 alterations were detected in 50% of the cases,
followed by EGFR (27.5%) and MET (17.5%) alterations
(Figure 3B).

RESULTS
Analysis of control samples from healthy persons
During the technology development process, 79
healthy normal controls (source: AllCells, http://www.
allcells.com) were tested and, in those, a single TP53
R248Q mutation (heavy smoker, but no history of cancer)
was seen, typical of a somatic mutation. During patient
testing, samples from an additional 143 healthy persons
were analyzed as controls (not blinded). These controls
comprised about 60% male, with age ranging from 2050 years old. None of these individuals had a detectable
somatic mutation in the 54 gene panel (single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) were commonly seen but these are
ascertained as germline SNPs because they occur at close to
50% or 100% mutant allele frequencies in cell-free DNA).

Actionability of the detected alterations
Of the total of 171 analyzed patients, 69 had
potentially actionable alterations (40% of total, 70% of
the patients with alterations detected). Indeed, all these
69 patients had at least one matched experimental drug
available in clinical trials. Among these 69 patients, 68
patients (99% of 69 or 40% of total patients) also had
a least one matched FDA- approved drug (n=9 patients
with on-label use), Figure 4 and Table 2. Of note, the
majority of patients with gastrointestinal, lung, and
breast cancers had actionable alterations (83%, 60%, and
52.5%, respectively)—in all the cases with an actionable
aberration, the alteration could be matched to an FDAapproved drug, Figure 4B.
On the other hand, 102 patients (60%) had no
actionable alterations. In 72 of the 102 patients (70.6%)
(or 42% of the total of 171 patients), there was no
alteration detected. In addition, some patients (n=30,
17.5% of the 171 patients) had alterations, but they were
not theoretically actionable with currently available drugs,
either approved or investigational (Figure 4).

Patient characteristics
Our population comprised 171 patients with diverse
cancers who had a biopsy-free next-generation sequencing
ctDNA test performed on their blood. Patient’s median age
was 57 years old (range 19-87). There was a predominance
of women over men (n=104 (61%): n=67 (39%)), and the
most commonly represented cancers were lung (23%),
breast (23%), and glioblastoma (19%) Table 1.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing
results
The median time from sample receipt by the
testing laboratory to results was 13 days (95%CI 1213 days; range 6-27 days). In our 171 tested patients,
238 alterations were identified, with the majority being
mutations (n=211, 89%). Eleven percent of the identified
alterations were amplifications (27/238), although only
3 genes were tested for copy numbers (ERBB2, EGFR,
and MET). The most frequent alterations identified were
TP53 (29.8%), followed by EGFR (17.5%), MET (10.5%),
PIK3CA (7%), and NOTCH1 (5.8%) (Figure 1).
Of the total, 99 patients (58%) had at least one
detectable alteration(s). This includes 65% (90/138) of
patients with cancers other than glioblastoma, and 27%

DISCUSSION
Herein, we studied the molecular alterations
identified in 171 patients with diverse cancers using
targeted next-generation sequencing that analyzed
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) extracted from plasma.
We found that 58% of our patients demonstrated at least
one molecular alteration, and 32% had two or more
alterations. The most frequent alterations were TP53
mutations, detected in nearly 30% of our patients, similar
to previous reports wherein tissue was interrogated
[23]. Of interest, the frequency of some alterations,

such as MET in breast and lung tumors, was higher than
previously reported, though the rates reported vary widely
by study [24–27]. The higher rates of MET anomalies in
our study could be due to the advanced state of the patients
who usually undergo ctDNA testing, the relatively small
number of patients with each disease type in our study, or
the propensity for DNA bearing MET-related alterations to
be shed into the blood.
Forty percent of patients had a potentially actionable
alteration. Among the 99 patients with alterations
detected, 70% had a potentially actionable alteration.

Of note, three recent actionability studies performed on
tumor samples [28–30] (not ctDNA) report that 83-90%
percent of patients had at least one actionable alteration,
which is higher than in earlier reports, perhaps because
more comprehensive panels are now in use for tissues,
and more targeted drugs have been approved and entered
clinical trials. The ctDNA assay’s actionability was
based on a panel of 54 genes (point mutations tested
for all genes and copy numbers assessed in three of the
54 genes) (other genomic alterations such as indels and
fusions were not included at that time). In contrast, the

previous publications on tissue-based studies utilized
larger panels of about 200 genes assessed by NGS [28–
30]. Furthermore, the patient populations examined, as
well as the sensitivity of ctDNA versus tissue assays may
be other factors that account for these differences. Indeed,
in our study, 42% of patients did not have any detectable
alteration. This was most prominent for glioblastoma,

where 73% of patients (N = 33 total tested) had no
discernible alteration in their ctDNA. Of interest in this
regard, Bettegowda et al. [31] demonstrated the ability to
detect any ctDNA (albeit without sequencing the genes
in the ctDNA) in over 75% of 640 patients with various
cancer types, but in less than 50% of primary brain, renal,
prostate, or thyroid cancers, suggesting that physical

the PTEN/PI3K/mTOR axis (with several mTor inhibitors
approved, including everolimus, which is on-label for
breast cancer) or in the HER pathway.
There were several limitations to this study. First, it
included a limited number of patients in each histology.
Second, clinical annotation was not available since
the database was de-identified. Third, the definition of
“actionable” and the level of evidence needed for such
a determination is a matter of debate and in constant
evolution [34]. Fourth, the use of tissue-based next
generation sequencing as a comparison to establish clinical
utility was not accessible for this group of de-identified
patients. However, because many of our patients were
on treatment, it is important to note that concordance to
tissue-based NGS is challenged by the fact that ctDNA
is a dynamic measure and the original oncogenic driver
mutations may become undetectable in the plasma of
patients that are responding, or conversely, new resistance
mutations may arise in ctDNA that were not seen in the
original tissue biopsy [35–37]. Further, ctDNA tests may
measure shed DNA from multiple metastases. On the other
hand, ctDNA tests may not be sensitive enough to detect
some tissue NGS alterations. Additional studies will need
to perform in-depth analyses of the concordance between
tissue and ctDNA molecular results to better understand
the observations from each test. Finally, whether or not
the patients would have responded to these drugs could
not be addressed in this study, and will require further
investigation.
In conclusion, “liquid biopsies” are noninvasive, and have several advantages compared to
tissue biopsies. Most importantly, they require only

obstacles such as the blood-brain barrier and mucin could
prevent ctDNA from entering the circulation [32]. For
patients with primary brain cancers, cerebral spinal fluid
may serve as an alternative “liquid biopsy” by enabling a
more direct measurement of circulating DNA [33]. On the
other hand, it is interesting that 27% of our patients with
glioblastoma did have a discernible aberration on ctDNA
testing, suggesting the possibility that, as this technology
improves and incorporates highly prevalent alterations
such as EGFR vIII indels, it may become usable for even
higher percentages of these patients.
Overall, 65% of patients with malignancies other
than brain tumors had at least one identifiable anomaly in
their ctDNA. Sixty-eight patients (40%) had abnormalities
that could be prosecuted by at least one drug that was
approved for another disease (off-label use); and 9 patients
(5%) had at least one approved agent in their disease (onlabel use). Overall, 70% of patients with alteration(s) had
an aberration potentially actionable by an experimental
agent in clinical trials or by an approved agent. Previous
experience suggests that patient eligibility for these
clinical trials or their conduct at a limited number of
enrolling sites, as well as difficulty obtaining coverage for
off-label drug use, might limit patients’ access to cognate
medications [2].
Actionability by drugs that were FDA-approved was
common in breast (52.5%) and lung cancers (60%). For
lung cancers, EGFR alterations were frequent alterations;
they are actionable with approved drugs (since several
EGFR inhibitors are approved, including erlotinib, which
is authorized for lung cancer). For breast cancers, most of
the alterations actionable with an approved drug were in

a small amount of blood, rather than a biopsy that
can be invasive, painful, and, in some cases, have
complications. Evaluation of ctDNA obtained from
liquid biopsies is therefore also amenable to repeat
sampling. Furthermore, obtaining a blood sample is
efficient and inexpensive compared to obtaining a tissue
biopsy. Indeed, biopsies often cost thousands of dollars;
transthoracic and transbronchial lung needle biopsies
have been reported to cost over $14,000 on average,
based on a population-based national Medicare sample
[38]. Finally, it is now known that there is molecular
heterogeneity within and between tumors in the same
patient [14]. Therefore, theoretically, ctDNA results
may reflect genomic aberrations in DNA shed from
multiple metastatic sites. Our observations suggest
that, in our population, 40% of patients (69/171)
carried potentially actionable aberrations; almost all
of them had an aberration that could be targeted by an
approved drug (n = 68/69). However, only a minority
of individuals (9 patients) had aberrations that could
be targeted by drugs approved for their type of cancer
(on-label). This biopsy-free test has intrinsic clinical
utility by obviating the need for repeat invasivetissue biopsies at the time of progression of a visceral
malignancy. In cases where the ctDNA-based NGS
panel detects no genomic alterations, an invasive
tissue biopsy could then be considered to evaluate the
genomic status of the tumor. The rate of actionability
for the NGS test described here may further increase
with more comprehensive panels. To extend evidence
of clinical utility, the value of ctDNA-based, multipanel gene assays, such as those used in this study,
in monitoring patients and predicting tumor response
merits investigation in prospective trials.

com/guardant360/), a Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments (CLIA)-certified and College of American
Pathologists (CAP)-accredited clinical laboratory
(Guardant Health, Inc.). At the time of this study, this
test identifies potential tumor-related genomic alterations
via complete exon sequencing of 54 cancer-related genes
including amplifications in ERBB2, EGFR, and MET
through analysis of cell-free DNA extracted from plasma
(extracted from two blood tubes), Supplementary Table
S1. This circulating tumor DNA assay has high analytic
sensitivity (detects single molecules of somatic tumor
DNA in 10 mL blood samples), high clinical sensitivity
(detects 85%+ of the single nucleotide variants detected
in tissue in advanced cancer patients) (for stage III and
IV solid cancers) and analytic specificity (>99.9999%)
(Sensitivity was determined by comparing 165 sequential
matched plasma and tissue samples (Guardant Health,
data on file). Specificity >99.9999% represents the
analytic specificity, calculated from a controlled study of
20 samples comparing to exome sequencing of basepair
calls for all 78,000 base pairs in the panel (genomic
DNA analyzed by an independent CLIA-licensed and
CAP-accredited clinical laboratory). A high degree of
specificity is critical to eliminate the false positives (noise)
that otherwise accompany sequencing DNA at very low
concentrations over long targeted regions (in this case
~78,000 base pairs per sample). All cell-free DNA is
sequenced, including the germline cell-free DNA that
is derived from leukocyte lysis and the somatic ctDNA.
Single nucleotide variants are quantitated as mutant allele
fraction (MAF) which is the number of ctDNA fragments
divided by the number of wild type DNA fragments that
overlap the same mutated nucleotide base position. Gene
amplifications are reported as absolute gene copy number
in plasma. In each sequencing run, a normal control
sample is included (Guardant360 digital sequencing panel,
Guardant Health Inc, data on file).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Definition of actionability

We retrospectively reviewed the liquid biopsy results
of 171 consecutive de-identified patients with diverse
cancers who were seen at UC San Diego Moores Cancer
Center. Blood samples were collected between June, 2014
and January 2015. Analysis was performed per UCSD IRB
exempt approval for study of pre-existing de-identified
data. Analysis of usage patterns of liquid biopsies at our
institution indicates that about 95% of patients who have
had these tests performed have advanced or metastatic
disease. In addition, two series of healthy volunteers were
tested as controls (N = 79 followed by N = 143) (source:
AllCells, http://www.allcells.com).

Actionability implies that the protein product of
a genomic abnormality can be impacted by a specific
targeted drug. An actionable alteration was defined
as an alteration that was either the direct target (such
as an EGFR inhibitor targeting an EGFR mutation),
or a pathway component (such as an mTOR inhibitor
for a PIK3CA mutation (since mTor is downstream of
PIK3CA)) that could be targeted by at least one approved
(by the Food and Drug Administration) or investigational
drug in a clinical trial. (Actionability determination was
based on the ability of drugs that are small molecule
inhibitors to impact the aberration, with low IC50 against
the product of the aberration or effectors not more than
four signals removed from the gene aberration or its
product; if an altered gene product could be targeted by
an antibody whose primary target was the altered gene

Data extraction and analysis
Demographic information such as gender, age,
primary tumor site, as well as the dates of sample reception,
dates of results, list of alterations and actionability data
(included: number of actionable alterations, and more
specifically, the number of alterations with an approved
drug available in the disease (on-label use), the number of
alterations with an approved drug in another disease (offlabel use), and the number of alterations with experimental
drug(s) available (clinical trials)) were extracted from the
reports and analyzed.
Most of the statistical analysis was descriptive in
nature. When appropriate, median and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI) or range were reported. The sample
size was determined by the available patients with genetic
testing information. Analysis performed by author MS
