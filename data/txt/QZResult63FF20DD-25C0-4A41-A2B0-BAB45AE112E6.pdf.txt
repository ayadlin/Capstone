BACKGROUND: Cancer pain initiatives recommend using the personalized pain goal to tailor pain management. This
study was conducted to examine the feasibility and stability of personalized pain goal, and how it compares to
the clinical pain response criteria. METHODS: Records of 465 consecutive cancer patients seen in consultation at the
Supportive Care Clinic were reviewed. Pain relief was assessed as clinical response (30% or 2 point pain reduction)
and personalized pain goal response (pain  personalized pain goal). RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two (34%),
95 (21%), and 163 (37%) patients presented with mild (1-4), moderate (5-6), and severe (7-10) pain, respectively.
Median age (59 years), males (52%), and advanced cancer status (84%) did not differ by pain category. Median
personalized pain goal at initial clinic consult was 3 (interquartile range, 2-3), was similar across pain groups, and
remained unchanged (P ¼ .57) at follow-up (median, 14 days). Clinical response was higher among patients with
severe pain (60%) as compared with moderate (40%) and mild pain (33%, P < .001). Personalized pain goal response
was higher among patients with mild pain (63%) as compared with moderate (44%) and severe pain (27%, P < .001).
By using personalized pain goal response as the gold standard for pain relief, the sensitivity of clinical response was
highest (98%) among patients with severe pain, but it had low specificity (54%). In patients with mild pain, clinical
response was most specific for pain relief (98%), but had low sensitivity (52%). CONCLUSIONS: Personalized pain
goal is a simple patient-reported outcome for pain goals. The majority of patients were capable of stating
their desired level for pain relief. The median personalized pain goal was 3, and it was highly stable at follow-up

INTRODUCTION
Pain is among the most frequent, feared, and burdensome of symptoms in cancer patients and negatively impacts
quality of life.1-5 Pain intensity is recognized as the dominant factor that determines the effect of pain on the patient and
the urgency of the treatment process,6,7 and in most circumstances, its assessment relies primarily on the patient’s selfreport, which is considered the gold standard.
Pain control is a major outcome of quality improvement (QI) initiatives. An important part of current recommendations is the frequent assessment of pain intensity, prompt analgesic interventions for pain relief, and the reassessment of
patient’s response to such treatments.8-12 The frequent assessment for the presence and intensity of pain is now considered
standard of care in US health care facilities. However, measures to capture the various multidimensional attributes of quality pain management and what constitutes meaningful improvement of pain to an individual patient have not been clearly
defined. Studies suggest a low level of correlation between patient satisfaction with pain management and reported intensity of pain and/or pain relief,13-20 although higher satisfaction appears to be related to good communication between the
health care team and the patient, and to patients being treated as informed partners and being involved in the management

of their pain.13,15 The most frequently reported outcome
of cancer pain relief, used mainly in clinical trials of analgesic drugs, is the ‘‘clinically significant’’ reduction in pain
intensity or clinical response; in acute cancer pain, it is
suggested to be 2 points reduction on a 0 to 10 scale, or
a 33% overall reduction in pain intensity.21 However,
such reductions may not represent meaningful pain relief
to the patient. As an example, in a patient reporting severe
pain of 9-10, a pain reduction by 2 points would still leave
the patient with a pain of 7, which would still be considered as severe pain, and although meaningful, the degree
of pain relief may be insufficient for overall patient
comfort.
One way of addressing how pain management goals
can be set to individualize care is the personal pain goal,
which relies on the patients’ own criteria for meaningful
pain relief. Similar to how the pain intensity is assessed,
patients are asked to describe, on a 0 to 10 scale, the level/
intensity of pain that will allow the patient to achieve
comfort in physical, functional, and psychosocial
domains. The personalized pain goal can convey to the
medical provider the patients’ desire and expectations of
what his/her pain should be. The assessment of personalized pain goal along with the pain intensity is routinely
done in the outpatient and inpatient settings at our
institution.
The main objective of the present study was to
examine the feasibility and stability of the self-reported
personalized pain goal in cancer patients being treated at
the outpatient Supportive Care Clinic. Our secondary
objective was to compare pain response as determined by
personalized pain goal versus traditional pain response
criteria.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Subjects
This study was approved by our institutional review board
with waiver of informed consent. Consecutive patients
with advanced cancer who were seen for the first time in
consultation in the outpatient Supportive Care Clinic
over a 15-month period (from June 1, 2008 to August 31,
2009) were identified. In this study, advanced cancer was
defined as locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease for solid tumors, and relapsed or refractory disease for
hematologic malignancies. Patients who were unable or
unwilling to receive curative-intent therapies for any reason or referred for phase 1 treatments were also considered
to have advanced cancer. Only those patients who had

their first follow-up visit in the clinic within 1 to 6 weeks
of initial consultation were included in the analysis.
The time period of 1 to 6 weeks was chosen in an effort to
evaluate the response to the Supportive Care Clinic
intervention with minimal impact from other factors such
as increased pain from tumor growth.
The Supportive Care Clinic conducts assessment and
management of cancer patients by a sophisticated team of
board-certified palliative care physicians, nurses, and other
psychosocial disciplines. All patients undergo comprehensive symptom assessments and management during each of
their visits. All physicians follow a uniform set of standards
for assessment and treatment interventions.
Data Collection
Patient’s medical records were reviewed for information
pertinent to patient demographics (age at the first consult
visit, sex, ethnicity, and marital status); cancer diagnosis
(type, location, and stage); dates of advanced cancer diagnosis, first consultation, and follow-up visit; symptoms
such as pain, fatigue, nausea, and others (ascertained from
the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale [ESAS]) and
overall symptom burden; personalized pain goal; current
use and dosage of opioids (calculation of morphine
equivalent daily dose [MEDD]); screening test for history
of alcohol dependence (cut down, annoy, guilt, eyeopener [CAGE]); Zubrod performance status; and
cognitive status (Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale
[MDAS]).
ESAS, CAGE score, Zubrod status, MDAS, and
personalized pain goal are standard assessments that are
used by our team at all consultations as well as all followup visits and are further described. The ESAS is a validated, self-report tool that assesses the intensity of the
most common 10 individual symptoms (pain, fatigue,
drowsiness, nausea, anxiety, depression, appetite, dyspnea, sense of well-being, and insomnia) on a 0 to 10
numerical scale (0 ¼ best, 10 ¼ worst) in patients with
advanced incurable illness.22,23 Pain and other symptoms
on the ESAS were rated based on the average score in the
previous 24-hour period. The ESAS has been found to be
valid, reliable, and responsive when using this anchoring.24 Overall symptom burden was calculated as the total
symptom distress score from summation of the 10 symptom item scores on the ESAS, giving values between 0
and 100.22 Personalized pain goal is defined as ‘‘the verbal
or written goal stated by the patient describing the
desired level/intensity of pain that will allow the patient to
achieve comfort in physical, functional, and psychosocial

domains.’’ The personalized pain goal was assessed by the
outpatient palliative care nurse. Patients are asked to identify the maximal intensity of pain on a scale of 0 to 10 that
would still be considered comfortable. Because of the
nature of personalized pain goal, it was asked as a general
question rather than an anchoring to any particular period
of time.
The CAGE alcohol questionnaire is frequently used
as a brief screening tool for alcohol abuse.25 A positive
CAGE score of 2 has been shown to be of prognostic
value in the opioid management of cancer pain.26 At each
consultation visit, all patients complete the CAGE questionnaire. At each follow-up visit, the nurse confirms that
a CAGE questionnaire has been previously completed. If
not, patients are asked to complete questionnaire at the
subsequent visits. The Zubrod score assesses patient
functionality (performance status) and ranges from 0 to
5 (0 ¼ fully active; 1 ¼ restricted in strenuous activity; 2
¼ ambulatory, capable of self-care but not work; 3 ¼ bedridden 50% of the time, limited self-care; 4 ¼ totally
bedridden and disabled, no self-care; and 5 ¼ dead).27
Zubrod scores of 0 to 2 denote good functional status;
scores of 3 and 4 denote poor functional status. The
Zubrod score is calculated by the nurse, and confirmed by
the physician at each visit. The MDAS is a validated tool
to quantify the severity of delirium symptoms, and integrates objective cognitive testing and evaluation of behavioral symptoms.28 The MDAS yields a global score
ranging from 0 to 30, with a suggested cutoff score of 7
for delirium. The MDAS is completed by the nurse, and
confirmed by the physician at each visit.
The data collection team consisted of the principal
investigator (S.D.) who is a palliative care specialist, a
palliative care specialty fellow (L.N.), 2 research nurses,
and the departmental data management team.

Assessment of Pain and Pain Relief
Pain score was obtained from the ESAS. Pain was considered to be mild if pain score was 1 to 4, moderate if 5 to 6,
and severe if 7 to 10.29,30 Pain response was determined at
the first follow-up visit via 2 methods: clinical pain
response and personalized pain goal response. Patients
were considered to have achieved a clinical pain response
if there was reduction in pain score by 2 points or a
reduction by 30% from their baseline pain score.31
Patients were considered to have achieved a personalized
pain goal response if their follow-up pain score was less
than their personalized pain goal.

Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics, including median and interquartile
range (IQR), were used to summarize patient demographics, disease-related characteristics, symptom scores,
and personalized pain goal. To evaluate the feasibility of
personalized pain goal assessment, we assessed the proportion of charts containing a personalized pain goal score at
the consultation visit. To assess the stability of the personalized pain goal score, we assessed the proportion of charts
at follow-up that had a personalized pain goal score that
was equal to or within 1 point of the baseline personalized
pain goal score. Frequencies and proportions were used to
summarize achievement of personalized pain goal and
clinical pain response at follow-up visits. On the basis of
the sample size of 300, the 95% confidence interval for
the true rate of personalized pain goal achievement would
be no wider than 5.7%.
We used predefined cutpoints to classify patients
into 3 pain categories (mild, moderate, or severe) based
on their baseline pain scores on the ESAS. Differences
between pain category groups were analyzed using the
Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and the chisquare test for categorical variables. A P value <.05 was
considered statistically significant.
To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the
clinical pain response criteria, we used the patient personalized pain goal as the gold standard. A 2  2 table was
constructed with responses versus nonresponses of personalized pain goal and clinical responses.32 Sensitivity was
defined as the number of patients who achieved a clinical
response divided by all the patients who achieved a personalized pain goal response. Specificity was defined as
the number of patients who did not achieve a clinical
response divided by all the patients who did not achieve a
personalized pain goal response. Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (version 17; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill) was
used for statistical analyses.

RESULTS
Of the 944 cancer patients identified to have an outpatient Supportive Care consultation, 465 (49%) patients
met the time to follow-up inclusion criteria (1-6 weeks
from consultation visit) in the defined 15-month period
of study (Fig. 1).
Twenty (4.5%) of the eligible 465 patients had no
available personalized pain goal data and were excluded
from analysis. The median age of 445 patients was 59
years (range, 16-89 years), and majorities were male

(52%), Caucasian (69%), and married (66%), and had
advanced cancers (84%). The most common malignancies were gastrointestinal, lung, and head and neck. At
baseline, 35 (8%) patients reported no pain. Pain was in
the mild category in 152 (34%) patients, moderate in 95
(21%) patient, and severe in 163 (37%) patients. Patient
characteristics by pain category are presented in Table 1.
There were no significant differences between pain groups
with regard to ethnicity, marital status, or type of cancer
(P > .5).

Figure 1. Patient selection process over a 15-month period is
shown, illustrating eligible and ineligible patients.

At baseline, patients with severe pain had higher
Zubrod scores (median 2 vs 1, P ¼ .001) and were on
higher opioid dosage (median MEDD, 60 mg vs 0; P <
.001) than all other pain categories. There were more
CAGE-positive patients among patients reporting no pain
versus those patients with any type of pain (P < .001).
At follow-up (median, 14 days; IQR, 11-25 days),
we observed a significant decrease in pain and overall
symptom burden. As shown in Table 2, pain decreased
from a median of 5 (IQR, 3-8) to 4 (IQR, 2-7; P < .001),
and ESAS symptom distress score from a median of 39
(IQR, 29-50) to 34 (IQR, 23-48; P < .001).
We observed no significant difference in baseline
demographics, such as sex (P ¼ .6), age, ethnicity, and
advanced cancer status (P > .1), between patients who
were not eligible for the current study (Fig. 1, 479
patients) and patients who met the eligibility criteria (data
not shown). However, with regard to baseline symptoms,
patients who returned for follow-up in <1 week had
higher pain (median, 6 vs 5; P < .001) and overall

variation (52% patients) or being within 1 baseline personalized pain goal value in 85% patients. The Spearman
correlation between baseline and follow-up personalized
pain goal was 0.469 (P < .001).

Personalized Pain Goal
The median baseline personalized pain goal was 3 (IQR,
2-3). Despite significant differences in pain intensity
among the 3 baseline pain categories, median personalized
pain goal remained consistent at 3 (Table 2). However,
patients with no baseline pain reported a small, albeit
significantly different baseline personalized pain goal
(median personalized pain goal, 2; IQR, 0-3; P < .001) as
compared with patients with any pain. Baseline personalized pain goal value was 0 in only 8 of 410 patients (2%)
with pain 1, and in 16 of 35 (46%) patients with no
baseline pain (P < .001). Baseline personalized pain goal
was 1 in 23 (5%), 2 in 111 (25 %), 3 in 201 (45%), and
4 in 66 (15%) patients overall.
At follow-up visit, the overall median personalized
pain goal remained unchanged (P ¼ .57). Figure 2 illustrates that for the vast majority of patients, personalized
pain goal at follow-up was quite stable, either showing no

Assessment of Pain Response
Pain response was assessed as the proportion of patients
who achieved a personalized pain goal response and clinical pain response. Figure 3 illustrates the breakdown of
pain responses by baseline pain category and for all
patients. Overall, personalized pain goal response and
clinical response were achieved in 207 (47%) and 184
(41 %) patients, respectively. Figure 3 clearly shows that
clinical response was significantly higher among patients
with baseline severe pain (60%), as compared with
patients who had moderate (40%) and mild (33%) pain
(P < .001). Conversely, personalized pain goal response
showed the opposite results, and was achieved more often
among patients with mild pain (63%) as compared with
patients with moderate (44%) and severe pain (27%)
(P < .001). One area where clinical response and personalized pain goal response appeared to behave similarly was
among those patients with moderate pain (40% and 44%,
respectively). Table 2 demonstrates the epidemiological
performance of clinical response, when using the achievement of personalized pain goal as the gold standard for
pain relief. The sensitivity of clinical response was highest
(98%) among patients with severe baseline pain, but in
these patients its specificity was lowest (54%), resulting in
a large number of false-positive responses (46%). In
patients with mild pain, the opposite was true. Among
these patients, clinical response was quite specific for pain
relief (98%), but had low sensitivity (52%), resulting in a
large number of false negatives (48%). Among patients

DISCUSSION
Pain control is vital to the quality of life of cancer patients,
and is a major outcome of QI initiatives. In the past few
decades, several professional organizations have advocated
for cancer pain relief by calling for improvements in pain
education, health care policies, and institutional commitment to pain-related QI initiatives.9,12,33-43 An important
part of current recommendations is the frequent assessment of pain intensity, prompt interventions for pain
relief, and reassessment of the patient’s response to such
treatments.9,44-46 QI initiatives thus far have predominantly been focused on documentation of pain assessment
at frequent intervals, with much less emphasis on individual pain outcomes such as effectiveness of prescribed medications. This may be in part because as of yet methods to
best determine the effectiveness of cancer pain management are still lacking, and what constitutes meaningful
pain relief to an individual patient is not clear. As pain is
inherently subjective and personal, greater patient
involvement in decision making about pain management
options is now increasingly advocated, with recommendations that pain treatments and goals be tailored to the
needs, desires, and circumstances of individual
patients.9,11 One method adopted by our institution
recently is to use the patients’ own criteria for meaningful
pain relief, the personalized pain goal, which is included
as part of the comprehensive pain assessment in the outpatient and inpatient settings. A pain score that is equal to or
less than the personalized pain goal score could immediately relay to the provider that pain is adequately controlled to the patient’s satisfaction. The present study was
conducted to examine: 1) the feasibility and stability of

3874

personalized pain goal; and 2) to compare personalized
pain goal response to the traditional clinical pain response
criteria.
We found that the vast majority (445 of 465
patients; 95%) of eligible cancer patients seen in our outpatient Supportive Care Clinic had documentation of
personalized pain goal scores. This suggests that this simple assessment is feasible in a busy outpatient setting, and
that patients are capable of stating their desired value (personalized pain goal) for pain relief on a 0 to 10 scale, and
that the majority considered a value of 3 to be very reasonable, which is consistent with literature suggesting that
pain in the mild category is an achievable patient outcome.6,7 The median personalized pain goal score of 3
was consistent among the 3 pain groups, suggesting that
patients do not decide their personalized pain goal based
on their pain intensity at a given time. Furthermore, at the
follow-up visit, patient’s personalized pain goal score
either remained the same or was within 1 point in 52%
and 85% of patients, respectively, thereby suggesting that
individual patients are able to be consistent in their
desired goal for pain relief. Because the use of the scale is
subjective, there were some patients who had extreme variation depending on how they interpreted their personalized pain goal. For instance, 30% of patients had
personalized pain goal scores of 2, and 15% of patients
had scores of 4. This suggests that rather than using 3 as
a gold standard for all patients, an individualized pain
goal (the personalized pain goal) is more appropriate for
the treatment plan and for quality assurance. Of surprise
to us was that only a small minority (2%) of patients with
pain reported a personalized pain goal value of 0. This
may suggest that cancer patients with pain are realistic
regarding what can be achieved in the management of
their pain, and that complete elimination of their pain is
very unlikely.
When we compared the 2 pain responses, we found
that the overall rate of personalized pain goal response and
clinical response criteria were not different. However, as
demonstrated in Figure 3, we observed significant differences between the 3 pain categories. Patients with severe
pain at baseline were more likely to achieve a clinical
response (60% of patients), as compared with patients
with moderate (40%) or mild (33%) pain. Conversely,
patients with severe pain were less likely to achieve a personalized pain goal response (27%), as compared with
patients with moderate (44%) or mild pain (63%). Our
findings with personalized pain goal response by pain category are also much more consistent with what would be

expected in the clinical care of these patients. Patients
with mild to moderate pain would be expected to achieve
a more acceptable level of analgesia than those patients
who complain of moderate to severe pain, and in this population the use of clinical response criteria resulted in
appropriate results. When using achievement of personalized pain goal as the gold standard for pain relief, the sensitivity of clinical response was highest (98%) among
patients with severe baseline pain, but in these patients its
specificity was lowest (54%), resulting in a large number
of false-positive responses (46%). Because patient’s overall
impression of the estimation of their pain control as compared with their expectations is the proposed goal for clinical care and quality assurance, our results suggest that
using clinical response criteria for pain relief has variable
sensitivity and specificity, and comparing pain intensity
over time with the patient’s personalized pain goal may be
the more useful and simple outcome. Thus, the personalized pain goal may be the way to operationalize the recommended outcome suggested by the American Pain Society
and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for
cancer pain management. Studies have shown that higher
satisfaction in pain management appeared to be related to
good communication between the health care team and
the patient, and to patients being treated as informed partners and involved in the management of their pain.13,15
Although clinical response might be useful in clinical trials comparing different analgesic treatments, the
inclusion of personalized pain goal response might be
more useful in determining which patients have achieved
satisfactory pain control. Our results reflect the importance of obtaining a personalized pain goal, because a
drop in pain intensity by 2 points is much easier to achieve
in patients with severe pain, and that can falsely suggest
that these patients achieved acceptable analgesia. For
example, in our cohort, follow-up pain improved
clinically and statistically (from median pain score of 8 to
6, P < .001); however, according to the personalized pain
goal response criteria, the majority (53%) of our patients
did not achieve their personalized pain goal. These findings suggest that although the interventions at our clinic
successfully reduced pain by the clinical response criteria
in the first follow-up visit, they were not lowered enough
to the personalized pain goal level for a majority of
patients. This suggests that perhaps other interventions
such as earlier follow-up intervals, phone calls, or aggressive pharmacological treatment at the first consult might
be more appropriate for some patients. The presence of
several factors such as neuropathic pain, breakthrough

pain, pain intensity, history of chemical coping or addiction, psychological distress, and cognitive failure have
been shown to be associated with the complexity of cancer
pain management.6,26,47-50 Most of these risk factors have
been incorporated into the recently developed and validated cancer pain classification system, the Edmonton
Classification System for Cancer Pain,51 and they also
bring to light that cancer patients may have diverse interpretations of their pain experience, and an individualized
approach to pain management and assessment of pain
relief should be implemented. We plan to conduct further
research into identifying factors associated with nonachievement of personalized pain goal response. In our
study, the overall frequency of CAGE positivity was 11%.
Previous studies by our group and others have shown frequency of CAGE positivity in cancer patients referred to a
palliative care service to range from 11% to 38%.26,52-55
Most of these studies were conducted in patients who did
report cancer pain, and CAGE positivity was associated
with higher levels of pain expression, opioid use, or longer
time to achieve stable pain control. Our results regarding
higher frequency of CAGE positivity in patients with no
reported pain are surprising and may be explained by the
very small number of patients in this category. More
research is necessary to better characterize the role of
CAGE status on both personalized pain goal and pain
intensity reporting.
Our study has several limitations, including issues
related to the retrospective design such as missing data.
Our eligibility criteria restricted our analysis to only those
patients who had their first follow-up visit in the clinic
within 1 to 6 weeks of initial consultation, thereby excluding approximately half the patients who were initially seen
in outpatient consultation. However, this time frame was
chosen in an effort to evaluate the response to the
Supportive Care Clinic interventions. Patients returning
<1 week after initial visit have minimal time to allow the
recommended interventions to be fully effective. Conversely, patients returning after >6 weeks had a higher
risk of complications related to tumor progression that
may not have been present during the initial visit. Furthermore, our study was conducted in a highly specialized
comprehensive cancer center, and the type of care delivered in the supportive care clinic may have affected the
response (eg, pharmacological management, psychosocial
management of other symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and fatigue, or family care). Further studies are
required to better characterize the multiple different interventions on both the personalized pain goal and pain

intensity reporting, and to determine whether our findings are generalizable to other settings.
Conclusions
Our preliminary study suggests that the vast majority of
cancer patients with pain were capable of stating their
desired level for pain relief on a 0 to 10 scale. The median
personalized pain goal was 3, and was highly stable over
our follow-up period. Personalized pain goal represents a
novel target for pain response. Regular documentation of
personalized pain goal can potentially facilitate personalized pain management.
