Abstract
EBV-associated gastric carcinoma is a distinct subset of
gastric carcinoma infected with EBV, which shows latency I
type expression of EBV latent genes (EBNA1, EBER, BARF0, and
LMP2A). To clarify the role of EBV in this type of gastric
carcinoma, the cell biological characteristics (growth, apoptosis, and migration) were evaluated in gastric carcinoma
cell lines (MKN-1, TMK1, MKN-74 and MKN-7) with and
without infection of recombinant EBV harboring the neomycin resistance gene. The infection reiterated the latency I type
infection, and the only difference observed in EBV-infected
gastric carcinoma cell lines was the resistance to serum
deprivation–induced apoptosis. Comparative analyses of transcripts of apoptosis-associated genes in MKN-1 and EBV–
MKN-1 and subsequent quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
analysis showed up-regulation of the cellular survivin gene in
EBV-infected gastric carcinoma cell lines. Small interfering
RNA–mediated knockdown of survivin increased apoptosis in
EBV–MKN-1 to the level of the original MKN-1 cells. Transfection of EBV-latent genes into MKN-1 showed that LMP2A,
but not EBNA1, EBER, or BARF0, up-regulated survivin gene
expression. LMP2A-mediated survivin up-regulation in gastric
carcinoma cells was inhibited with a nuclear factor-KB
(NF-KB) inhibitor, Bay 11-7082. In parallel with these findings
in vitro, survivin expression was frequent in carcinoma tissues
of gastric carcinoma by immunohistochemistry, and significantly more in EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (12 of 13)
than in EBV-negative gastric carcinoma in the advanced stage
(P = 0.0307). Thus, EBV uses its latent protein, LMP2A, to
activate the NF-KB–survivin pathway to rescue EBV-infected
epithelial cells from serum deprivation, and up-regulation of
survivin may play a role in the progression of this specific
type of gastric carcinoma infected with EBV. [Cancer Res
2008;68(5):1427–35]

Introduction
EBV-associated gastric carcinoma is a distinct subset of gastric
carcinoma, accounting for 10% or less of total gastric carcinoma
(1, 2). A causal role of EBV in gastric carcinoma has been suggested
on the basis of the clonal nature of EBV in neoplastic cells (3), the
presence of EBV in all cancer cells, and the absence of EBV in
noncancerous mucosa (4); however, the exact role of EBV in the
development and progression of this specific type of gastric

carcinoma has not been clarified. EBV-associated malignant
neoplasms are classified into three types, latency I, II, and III,
according to the expression profile of EBV-latent genes (5). EBVassociated gastric carcinoma, as well as Burkitt’s lymphoma,
belongs to latency I, in which the expression of viral latent genes
is restricted to EBV-determined nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1),
EBV-encoded poly(A) RNAs (EBER), latent membrane protein 2A
(LMP2A), and transcripts from the BamHI A region (BARF0;
refs. 6–8). Latency II neoplasm includes nasopharyngeal carcinoma
and Hodgkin’s lymphoma and is characterized by the expression of
LMP1 (9), a transmembrane protein with transforming capacity for
rodent fibroblasts. EBNA2 (10), EBNA3A, and EBNA3C, essential for
immortalizing resting B-lymphocytes, are additionally expressed
due to the lack of effective immune mechanisms in patients
with latency III neoplasms, such as lymphomas in AIDS or organ
transplant patients (11, 12). Because latency I neoplasms arise in
nonimmunodeficient patients without the expression of LMP1 or
EBNA2, the question has been raised about the role of EBV in these
neoplasms. In the case of Burkitt’s lymphoma, however, loss of EBV
from the EBV-positive lymphoma cell line, Akata, abolishes colonyforming capacity in soft agar and tumorigenicity in nude mice,
demonstrating that EBV contributes to the tumorous growth of
latency I–type neoplasms (13, 14).
One crucial problem to investigate this issue in EBV-associated
gastric carcinoma is the lack of an ideal experimental model, like
the Akata cell line in Burkitt’s lymphoma. It is well known that
EBV is hardly maintained in epithelial cells in culture; therefore,
to reiterate the role of EBV infection in EBV-associated gastric
carcinoma in vitro, we have systematically compared the cell biological characteristics (growth, apoptosis, and migration) of gastric
carcinoma cell lines with and without infection of recombinant
EBV. In this screening, we observed that resistance to serum
deprivation–induced apoptosis is characteristic of EBV-infected
gastric carcinoma cell lines. Subsequent analyses showed that upregulation of the cellular survivin gene, by viral latent protein
LMP2A, is responsible for the survival advantage of EBV-infected
cells. Survivin is the smallest member of a family of proteins,
known as inhibitors of apoptosis protein (IAP; ref. 15), which plays
a key role in the regulation of apoptosis and cell division. Using
immunohistochemistry, we also showed that survivin expression
was significantly high in the advanced stage of EBV-associated
gastric carcinoma in vivo.
LMP2A is a viral protein that is expressed as a transmembrane
protein in latently infected cells of latency I, II, and III. LMP2A
functions to inhibit normal B-cell signal transduction by mimicking
an activated B-cell receptor, but simultaneously activates the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway for cell survival in
latently infected B-cells (16). The expression of LMP2A induces
alterations in gene transcription similar to those observed in ReedSternberg cells of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. On the other hand, the

function of LMP2A and its modulation of the signal pathway have
not yet been fully clarified in epithelial cells, especially stomach
epithelial cells. The present study will provide an insight into the
mechanisms of the development of a representative latency I
epithelial cell malignancy (i.e., EBV-associated gastric carcinoma).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, culture, and reagents. The gastric carcinoma cell lines used
in the study were MKN-7, MKN-74, TMK1, and MKN-1 (17–19), which
were originally derived from gastric carcinoma with histologic features of
well, moderately, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma, respectively. The gastric carcinoma cell lines were
maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FCS
(MP Biomedicals), penicillin (40 units/mL), and streptomycin (50 Ag/mL) at
37jC in a 5% CO2 incubator.
For inhibitor studies, the NF-nB inhibitor Bay 11-7082 (Calbiochem) was
used to block the specific signaling pathway.
EBV infection. Each gastric carcinoma cell line was infected with
recombinant EBV using the cell-to-cell contact method (20). A Burkitt’s
lymphoma cell line, Akata, was modified to produce recombinant EBV, in
which the neomycin resistance gene (Neor ) is inserted into BXLF1 (21) and
was used as a source of the virus in the present study. Establishment of EBV
infection was confirmed by EBER in situ hybridization (ISH), which was
applied to gastric carcinoma cells grown on plastic slides after fixation with
10% formalin.
After selection with G418 (700 Ag/mL; Sigma), EBV-infected cells were
maintained in bulk, but G418 in the medium for EBV-infected gastric
carcinoma cell lines was removed 24 h before the experiment. For serum
depletion experiments, exponentially growing cells cultured in complete
medium were centrifuged, washed twice with serum-free medium, and
incubated in RPMI 1640.
Cell growth assay. The cell growth rate was determined using Cell
Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo). Cells were seeded on 96-well plates at 5  103/
100 AL per well and cultured with 10% FCS. After 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h
incubation, 10 AL of Cell Counting Kit-8 solution were added to each well
and absorbance was measured at 655 nm as a reference.
Terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase–mediated nick-end labeling assay. Cells were grown on the four-chamber slide well (BD
Biosciences) until 70% confluence. After fixing the cells with 10% formalin,
terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase–mediated nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) reactions were performed using BD ApoAlert DNA Fragmentation
Assay Kit (BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
TUNEL labeling index was calculated by counting positive cells per 1,000
under a fluorescence microscope. All experiments were performed in
triplicate.
Cell migration assay. The in vitro wound-healing method was used.
Cells were grown to confluence in six-well plates and then the monolayer
was wounded with a plastic pipette tip. The wound area was photographed
under a microscope and >15 h thereafter. The distance that cells had moved
into the denuded area was determined using computer-driven image
analysis at three distinct points in the wound, and the mean was used for
analysis. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Reverse transcription-PCR of EBV-latent genes. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of EBV latent genes (BARF0, EBER1, EBNA1,
EBNA2, LMP1, and LMP2A and LMP2B) was performed in gastric
carcinoma cell lines (MKN-1, TMK-1, MKN-74, and MKN-7) with and
without EBV infection. Total RNA was extracted from the original and EBVinfected gastric carcinoma cell lines by the acid guanidium/phenol/
chloroform method using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was used
to evaluate the expression of EBV-latent genes, as previously reported (15).
PCR reaction was performed using a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied
Biosystems). Ten microliters of each PCR product were then separated on
2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed under a
UV transilluminator. An EBV-infected Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line, Raji,
was used as a positive control for the RT-PCR analysis of BARF0, EBER1,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (5). March 1, 2008

EBNA1, EBNA2, LMP1, and LMP2B, and the Akata cell line was used for
LMP2A.
Oligonucleotide microarray analysis. One representative gastric
carcinoma cell line (MKN-1) and MKN-1 with EBV infection (EBV–
MKN-1), incubated for 96 h under 0% FCS condition, were subjected to
oligonucleotide microarray analysis. After the total RNA was isolated by
the acid guanidium/phenol/chloroform method using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen), oligonucleotide microarray analysis (GeneChip; Affymetrix)
was carried out as described previously (22), according to the instructions
from the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. In
Affymetrix U133plus2.0 array used here, signals from one transcript (= probe
set) were measured by 11 probes, which allowed statistical evaluation for
signal difference between comparative two objects. The intensities (Table 1)
indicate the summed signals from 11 probes and are calculated as described
in the Web site.3 Briefly, to assess the significance of the intensity, the onesided Wilcoxon’s signed rank test was used where the signals from almost
11 probes needed to be different. When there was little difference in the
intensities from several probes among all 11 probes for a particular gene,
the gene expression difference between these two samples were regarded as
‘‘not statistically significant,’’ even if the summed signals seemed to be
different.
Quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA (3 Ag) was reverse transcribed using
the SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen).
PCR amplification was carried out using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR
SuperMix DUG (Invitrogen). The following primers were used for PCR:
survivin primer ( forward) 5¶-TGCCTGGCAGCCCTTTC-3¶ (reverse), 5¶-CCTCCAAGAAGGGCCAGTTC-3¶; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH; forward) 5¶-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3¶, (reverse) 5¶-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTC-3¶. Analysis was performed in triplicate. To ensure
the mRNA stability during the serum deprivation, agarose gel electrophoresis (1%) was performed using each sample of total RNA (3 Ag) at 0, 24, 48,
72, and 94 h after serum deprivation.
Western blot analysis. Cells were washed briefly in PBS, centrifuged,
and lysed in a lysis buffer consisting of 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1%NP40, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L
Ma3VO4, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protein inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma). For normalization of gel loading, protein extracts were
assayed with the ABC method (Pierce Laboratories), and, typically, 20 Ag of
the protein per lane were loaded. The following primary antibodies were
used: antisurvivin (mouse monoclonal, clone: 60.11, Novus Biologicals;
dilution 1:100), and anti-cIAP1 and anti-cIAP2 (rabbit polyclonal, R&D
Systems; 1:1,000), phosphorylated Akt (rabbit polyclonal, Cell Signaling
Technology; 1:50), Akt (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200),
P65 antibody (mouse polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:200), and antiHistone H1 antibody (mouse monoclonal, clone: AE-4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100). The filters were incubated with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
antibodies. The antigen was then detected using enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Small interfering RNAs. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences
directed to survivin (SVV-A: 5¶-GCCAAGAACAAAAUUGCAAAG-3¶, SVV-B:
5¶-GAAAGUGCGCCGUGCCAUCdTdT-3¶), and psiGL3B, a control vector
expressing siRNA against the firefly luciferase transcript (5¶-GUGCGCUGCUGGUGCCAACdTdT-3¶) were designed by siDirect4 (RNAi Co., Ltd.) and
manufactured by Proligo LLC. MKN-1 with or without EBV infection were
transfected by transfection reagent RNAiFect (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Protein was collected at 72 h posttransfection
under serum-deprived conditions.
Plasmids and transfection. Each EBV-latent gene, EBNA1, BARF0,
EBERs, or LMP2A, was cloned into pcDNA3 containing FLAG-tag. MKN-1
was transfected with each expression vector by lipofection. The expression
of each gene was confirmed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining

with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). To further confirm LMP2A-mediated
survivin expression in EBV-infected gastric carcinoma cell lines, TMK1 and
MKN7 were transfected with the LMP2A expression vector.
Effect of Bay 11-7082 on the LMP2A-mediated survivin expression.
A total of 7.5  105 per well gastric carcinoma cells (MKN-1, TMK1, and
MKN7) expressing LMP2A or FLAG (control) were incubated in RPMI 1640
with 10% FCS overnight. Cells were then maintained by 1% FCS medium for
60 h. Fresh medium containing 5 Amol/L Bay 11-7082 or vehicle control,
DMSO (Sigma), was added to the cells, which were further incubated for
12 h. The inhibitory effects of 5 Amol/L Bay 11-7082 on gastric carcinoma
cells expressing LMP2A or FLAG were evaluated by Western blotting
analysis. Nuclear proteins were extracted by the standard protocol and
blotted with P65 antibody. Histone H1 served as a loading control of nuclear
extracts. Total RNA (2 Ag) was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III
First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and assessed by quantitative
real-time RT-PCR for survivin.
Immunohistochemistry and ISH. The survivin protein expression
was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in gastric carcinoma tissues
in vivo, which were resected for the treatment of gastric cancer at
Tokyo University Hospital between 1993 and 1997. TMA was constructed
from 10% formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded blocks of gastric
carcinoma. All cases of gastric carcinoma were histologically diagnosed

www.aacrjournals.org

according to the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma (23) and
Lauren’s classification (24).
The presence of EBV in carcinoma tissues was evaluated by ISH targeting
EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER-ISH) with an EBER-PNA probe (DakoCytomation). Immunohistochemical analysis of survivin was applied to
TMA sections using an LSAB2 Kit (Dako) with a mouse monoclonal
antisurvivin antibody at a dilution of 1:500. To obtain negative controls,
the primary antibody was omitted. As criteria to evaluate survivin
expression, >10% positivity in carcinoma cells was considered as overexpression.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were appropriately performed
using the m2 test or t test. Differences were considered significant at
P < 0.05.

Results
Establishment of EBV-infected gastric carcinoma cell lines
showing type I latency. EBV-infected gastric carcinoma cell lines
were established after G418 selection, and stable infection was
confirmed by EBER1-ISH. These cells showed the same cytologic
appearance as the original cells. RT-PCR analysis confirmed that all
gastric carcinoma cell lines infected with EBV belonged to latency I,

not EBNA2 or LMP1 (Fig. 1A).
Resistance to serum deprivation–induced apoptosis is one
of the characteristics of EBV-infected gastric carcinoma cells.
To explore the changes closely associated with EBV infection of
gastric carcinoma epithelial cells, comparative studies were
performed on the growth rate (Fig. 1B), apoptosis (data not
shown), and cell migration (Fig. 1C) of gastric carcinoma cell lines
with and without EBV infection under the condition of 10% FCS.
There were no significant differences observed in any gastric
carcinoma cell lines with and without EBV infection. Because
apoptosis is induced by serum deprivation, we evaluated the

apoptotic profile under serum-free conditions. Apoptosis increased
over time, and became marked 72 h after the cells were placed
under 0% serum. The apoptotic index at 96 h after serum
deprivation (Fig. 1D) was significantly lower in three of four EBVinfected gastric carcinoma cell lines compared with the respective
original, such as in MKN-1 (71.2 F 6 versus 17.4 F 14, P = 0.003),
TMK1 (54.3 F 4 versus 5.9 F 9, P = 0.015), and MKN-74 (47.8 F 10
versus 24.8 F 7, P = 0.042).

conditions, using oligonucleotide microarray analysis (Table 1).
In Affymetrix U133plus2.0 array used here, the signal from one
transcript was measured by 11 probes, which allowed statistical
evaluation for signal difference between comparative two objects.
Among antiapoptotic IAP family proteins, only signals from
survivin gene were significantly different and the survivin probe
signals in EBV–MKN-1 were statistically higher than that in
MKN-1. With respect to other apoptosis-related genes, the levels of
caspase-3/9 mRNA did not show any changes. The expression of
Bcl-2 family members showed no difference between MKN-1
gastric carcinoma cell lines with and without EBV infection.
The time course of survivin mRNA expression, determined by
quantitative RT-PCR, confirmed the increased level in EBV-MKN1
at 72 and 96 h after serum deprivation (Fig. 2A), which was in
parallel with the decreased frequency of apoptotic cells. On the
other hand, survivin mRNA expression of the original MKN-1
decreased gradually, and, as a result, the differences were marked
at 72 and 96 h after serum deprivation. Agarose gel electrophoresis
showed preservation of 28S and 18S RNA in both MKN-1 and EBV–

MKN-1 throughout the period of serum starvation (Fig. 2A). Twoto 3-fold increase of survivin mRNA expression was similarly
observed in EBV-TMK-1 and EBV-MKN-74 at 72 h after serum
deprivation, both of which showed resistance to apoptosis (Fig. 2B).
Western blot analysis of IAP family proteins was performed to
confirm the increase of protein expression of survivin after serum
deprivation (Fig. 2C). Survivin protein expression was high in EBV–
MKN-1, but barely observed in MKN-1, under the condition of FCS
0% at 72 h of incubation. On the other hand, no increase was
observed in the protein expression of cIAP1 or cIAP2 in both
gastric carcinoma cell lines.

gastric carcinoma cell lines were placed under serum starvation
for 72 h. Transfection of SVV-B caused a slight decrease of the
protein level of survivin in MKN1 cells, but transfection of SVV-A
greatly decreased the protein level (Fig. 2D). When apoptotic cells

were evaluated by TUNEL, apoptotic cells dramatically increased
with SVV-A, but only slightly with SVV-B at 72 h after serum
deprivation. Importantly, the percentage of apoptosis in EBV–
MKN-1 with SVV-A was close to that in MKN-1 under comparable
conditions.
LMP2A as a responsible viral molecule for up-regulation of
survivin. As the first step to evaluate the mechanisms underlying
survivin up-regulation in EBV–MKN-1, the expression pattern of
EBV-latent genes was evaluated along the time course of serum
deprivation. The intensities of the amplified band of RT-PCR of
EBER, BARF0, and LMP2A RNAs were nearly equal during 72 h
under serum deprivation (Fig. 3A).
To identify the EBV gene responsible for survivin up-regulation,
vectors containing the LMP2A, EBER, EBNA1, or BARF0 gene were
transfected into MKN-1, and each stable gastric carcinoma cell line
was obtained with G418 selection. The expression level of each

gene in transfected MKN-1 cells was comparable with that in
EBV–MKN-1 by semiquantitative RT-PCR, respectively (Fig. 3A).
Survivin mRNA expression in each latent gene–transfected MKN1
cells was then evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR after 0, 24, 48,
and 72 h incubation under serum-deprived conditions (Fig. 3B).
Survivin mRNA expression increased in LMP2A-transfected MKN-1,
whereas it was stable in EBER–, EBNA1–, and BARF0–MKN-1
during serum deprivation (Fig. 3B).
To further confirm LMP2A as a responsible viral molecule for
the up-regulation of survivin in gastric carcinoma cells, we transfected LMP2A expression vector or control FLAG vector to TMK1
and MKN-7. EBV-infected TMK1 showed resistance to serum
deprivation–induced apoptosis, whereas EBV-infected MKN-7 did
not show any differences in apoptotic cell number under serum
deprivation. The increase of survivin mRNA expression after serum
deprivation (72 h) was observed in LMP2A-transfected TMK1

LMP2A-transfected MKN-7.

(2.40 F 0.5–fold relative to FLAG-transfected TMK1). On the other
hand, survivin mRNA expression was not different in LMP2Atrasfected MKN-7 (0.93 F 0.5–fold) compared with that in FLAGtransfected MKN-7.
LMP2A-mediated up-regulation of survivin. To obtain an
insight into the signal transduction pathway from viral LMP2A to
the up-regulation of cellular survivin, we first focused on the
expression profile data of EBV-MKN1 under serum deprivation
(Table 1). There was a significant increase of the mRNA expression
of p65 (Rel A) and Rel B, whereas there was no change in mRNA
of Akt1-3. In parallel with this finding, there was no increase in
Akt phosphorylation by Western blotting along the time course of
serum deprivation in EBV-MKN1, compared with Akt phosphorylation in MKN1 cells (Fig. 3C).
To evaluate the possible involvement of the NF-nB pathway in
LMP2A-mediated survivin up-regulation, the NF-nB inhibitor Bay
11-7082 was applied to MKN-1 gastric carcinoma cell lines
transfected with LMP2A vector (LMP2A-transfected MKN-1) and
control FLAG vector (FLAG-transfected MKN1). Because Bay
11-7082 was apparently toxic to EBV–MKN-1 for 24 h, we adopted
the condition of 1% of serum starvation and incubation of Bay
11-7082 in the last 12 h of the 72-h incubation under serum starvation. Under this condition, 5 Amol/L of Bay 11-7082 decreased
the p65 protein level and reduced the up-regulation of survivin
mRNA expression in LMP2A-transfected MKN1 (Fig. 3D). Incubation with Bay 11-7082 similarly reduced the up-regulation of
survivin mRNA expression in LMP2A-transfected TMK1 but not in
LMP2A-transfected MKN7.
Survivin expression in carcinoma tissues of surgically
resected gastric carcinoma. To clarify the clinical significance
of survivin expression in EBV-associated gastric carcinoma, immunohistochemical staining of survivin was applied to the tissue
microarray of gastric carcinoma; the results are summarized in
Table 2. Positive staining for survivin was predominantly observed
in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A) in 80 of 117 tumor tissue specimens
of gastric carcinoma (68.4%), 21 of 27 EBV-associated gastric
carcinomas (77.8%), and 59 of 90 EBV-negative gastric carcinomas
(65.6%). The nuclear staining of survivin (Fig. 4B) was observed in
8 of 80 cases showing survivin expression, 1 EBV-associated gastric
carcinoma, and 7 EBV-negative gastric carcinomas.
As for the clinicopathologic factors affecting the survivin expression in gastric carcinoma, the frequency of survivin expression was
significantly higher in EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (12 of 13)
than in EBV-negative gastric carcinoma (31 of 50) at the advanced
stage of gastric carcinoma (P < 0.0307). Positive ratio of survivin
expression was similarly high in intestinal and diffuse-type
histology in EBV-associated gastric carcinoma, but the ratio was
relatively lower in the diffuse type of EBV-negative gastric carcinoma (P = 0.1339). All of the gastric carcinoma cases showing
nuclear staining of survivin were diffuse type in histology, although
there was no morphologic difference between carcinoma cells with
or without nuclear staining.

Discussion
EBV infection in stomach epithelial cells in vitro invariably
showed the latency I type of EBV-latent gene expression similar to
the neoplastic cells of EBV-associated gastric carcinoma in vivo
(22). EBV-infected gastric carcinoma cells expressed EBNA1,
EBERs, LMP2A, and BARF0, but not EBNA2 or LMP1. In this
experimental condition, we showed that three of four gastric

carcinoma cells of latency I EBV infection showed resistance to
serum deprivation–induced apoptosis, although the growth rate
and cell mobility analyses did not show any differences. Serum
deprivation, mimicking the microenvironment of cancer tissue
in vivo, is a strong inducer of apoptosis through the intrinsic
pathway. Interestingly, a lower rate of apoptosis has also been well
documented in EBV-associated gastric carcinoma in vivo (25);
therefore, the mechanisms of resistance to apoptosis may be
important in this type of gastric carcinoma and should be further
investigated in relation to EBV infection.
Subsequent oligonucleotide array analysis of apoptosisassociated genes of the representative gastric carcinoma cell line,
MKN-1, with and without EBV infection has identified survivin as
a candidate for this resistance, among seven members of IAPs—
NAIP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, XIAP, survivin, livin, and ILP2 (26–28). RTPCR in other gastric carcinoma cell lines and Western blotting of
EBV–MKN-1 cells validated the array data. Knockdown of the
endogenous survivin level by siRNA-mediated RNA interference
(RNAi) in EBV–MKN-1 cells increased apoptosis to the level of the
original MKN-1 cells. These results indicate that increased survivin
expression causes resistance to serum deprivation–induced
apoptosis in EBV-infected gastric carcinoma cell lines. In parallel
with the results in vitro, survivin was highly expressed in nearly
all EBV-associated gastric carcinomas in the advanced stage
(12 of 13), and the frequency was significantly higher than that in
EBV-negative gastric carcinomas (31 of 51). Recently, Shi et al.
(29) showed the role of survivin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by
demonstrating its overexpression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
biopsies and the increase of irradiation-induced apoptosis by
siRNA treatment of survivin in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma
model C666-1 cell line. This nasopharyngeal carcinoma result is in
accordance with the results in the present study of gastric
carcinoma.

Figure 4. Immunohistochemistry of survivin in carcinoma tissues of gastric
carcinoma. Carcinoma tissues from patients’ stomachs were fixed in formalin
and embedded in paraffin, and their sections were subjected to survivin
immunostaining. A, cytoplasmic survivin expression in neoplastic epithelial cells
of EBV-associated gastric carcinoma. B, nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin
expression in neoplastic epithelial cells of EBV-associated gastric carcinoma.
C, negative expression of survivin in EBV-negative gastric carcinoma.

Survivin is abundantly expressed during development, but it is
undetectable in nonproliferating adult tissue (15). Its up-regulation
has been observed in various carcinomas with or without the
association of viral infection, but the mechanisms of survivin
overexpression are only partially understood. In normal ovaries,
survivin exon I is silenced by methylation, but it becomes
demethylated and transcriptionally active in ovarian carcinomas.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (5). March 1, 2008

We also evaluated exon I methylation of survivin according to
Hattori et al. (30), but the CpG sites remained unmethylated in
gastric carcinoma cell lines with EBV infection (data not shown).
On the other hand, in the present study of EBV-associated gastric
carcinoma, we identified the viral protein LMP2A that up-regulates
survivin, leading to apoptosis resistance. Various viral proteins are
known to up-regulate survivin expression in human neoplasms.
T-cell leukemia virus type I tax has the potential of transcriptional
activation of survivin through the NF-nB pathway (31). The
oncoprotein E6 of human papilloma virus type 16 up-regulates
survivin expression through interaction with p53. Survivin, upregulated by hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx), forms complexes
with HBx-interacting protein and binds pro-caspase-9, preventing
its recruitment to Apaf1 in hepatoma cells. Thus, survivin upregulation by viral protein may be a common denominator in the
mechanisms of human viral oncogenesis.
LMP2A is capable of transforming human keratinocyte cell line
HaCaT (32, 33) through the activation of Akt. Fukuda and
Longnecker (34) have shown that LMP2A inhibits transforming
growth factor-h1–mediated apoptosis by activating the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in the gastric cancer cell line
Hsc-39; however, the induction of Akt phosphorylation under
serum deprivation was not remarkable in EBV-MKN1 compared
with that in MKN-1 cells. Alternatively, the expression level of p65,
a subunit of NF-nB, in EBV–MKN-1 was significantly higher than
that in MKN-1. We showed that LMP2A-mediated survivin upregulation was inhibited by a NF-nB inhibitor in both MKN-1 and
TMK1. On the other hand, the up-regulation was not observed or
inhibited with a NF-nB inhibitor in MKN-7, in which EBV-infection
did not inhibit apoptosis after serum deprivation. These facts
indicate that LMP2A-NFkB pathway plays a primary role for
survivin up-regulation in EBV-associated gastric carcinoma and
also suggest that there are some prerequisites inherent in the
parental cells for the activation of this pathway. Because LMP2A is
constitutively expressed in EBV–MKN-1 cells, serum deprivation
may activate or elicit the LMP2A-NFkB pathway after the priming
period of 48 h, resulting in the up-regulation of survivin. Recently,
Stewart et al. (35) reported that LMP2A modulated NF-nB activity
in a nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line, HONE-1, although the
effect was reportedly inhibitory. Further studies are necessary to
investigate the interaction of LMP2A with the NF-nB pathway as a
possible mechanism for resistance to apoptosis.
In conclusion, up-regulation of survivin, induced by LMP2A,
confers resistance to serum deprivation–induced apoptosis in
EBV-infected gastric carcinoma cells and may play a role in the
progression of EBV-associated gastric carcinoma in vivo. EBV
uses its latent protein, LMP2A, to activate the NF-nB–survivin
pathway to rescue EBV-infected epithelial cells from apoptotic
threatening of serum deprivation. Further studies are necessary
to clarify the function of LMP2A and its downstream pathway for
therapeutic intervention in this specific type of gastric carcinoma
infected with EBV.
