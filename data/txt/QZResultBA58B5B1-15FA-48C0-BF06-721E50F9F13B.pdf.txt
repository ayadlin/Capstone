BACKGROUND. Despite decreased perioperative morbidity and mortality and clinical trials suggesting improved outcomes with adjuvant therapy, national practice
patterns in the management of pancreatic cancer remain poorly defined. The
purpose of the current study was to evaluate multimodality therapy utilization
and outcomes relative to hospital type and volume.

METHODS. Using the National Cancer Data Base, stage-specific treatment patterns were analyzed for 301,033 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Logistic regression was used to evaluate treatment utilization. Cox proportional

ancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in
the U.S. For 2007, the American Cancer Society estimates that
nearly 34,000 patients will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and
over 32,000 will die of the disease.1 Patients with pancreatic cancer
have a particularly dismal prognosis due to multiple factors including insidious presentation, aggressive tumor biology, technically
challenging surgical management, and lack of effective systemic
therapies.

However, over the last 20 years, significant
advances in preoperative evaluation, surgical techniques, and postoperative care have reduced the perioperative morbidity and mortality associated with
pancreatic surgery.2–6 Mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy has dropped from approximately 25% in
the 1960s to < 3% in some high-volume centers 4,5,7–10
Surgery remains the only potentially curative treatment for localized pancreatic cancer.6 Furthermore,
several multiinstitutional randomized clinical trials
have demonstrated the efficacy of multimodality
therapy.11–14
Despite improved morbidity and mortality after
pancreatectomy and clinical trials demonstrating
increased survival with adjuvant therapy, national
practice patterns in the management of pancreatic
cancer remain poorly defined and may vary widely.
The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate treatment trends in pancreatic adenocarcinoma over the
last 20 years, 2) identify hospital characteristics that
predicted whether patients received surgery with or
without adjuvant therapy, and 3) assess the impact
of surgery and adjuvant therapy on survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Data Acquisition
The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) is a program
of the American College of Surgeons and is recognized as the world’s largest clinical registry.15 The
NCDB captures newly diagnosed malignancies from
more than 1440 hospitals in the U.S., all of which are
approved by the Commission on Cancer (CoC).
These hospitals account for approximately 75% of all
new cancers in the U.S. each year. The NCDB collects
data regarding patient demographics, socioeconomic
status, tumor variables, preoperative and postoperative staging, treatment details, recurrence, survival,
and health systems/
provider information. Currently, there are more than
1440 hospitals reporting to the NCDB, which account
for approximately 73% of all new pancreatic cancers
diagnosed in the U.S.1 This study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern University. Results reported are in compliance with the
privacy requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as reported in
the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable
Health Information; Final Rule (45 CFR Parts 160 and
164).
Patients admitted between 1985 and 2003 with
2nd and 3rd edition International Classification of
Disease – Oncology (ICD-O-2 and ICD-O-3) codes
specific for the pancreas were selected (C25.0, C25.1,

FIGURE 1. Treatment trends by modality in the management of localized
(stages I and II) pancreatic adenocarcinoma from the National Cancer Data
Base, 1985–2003 (n 5 66,663).

C25.2, C25.3, C25.7, C25.8, and C25.9).5,16 Patients
were limited by ICD-O codes for histologies consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, yielding
301,033 patients from 1667 institutions. Patients were
divided into 2 groups (1985–1994 and 1995–2003) for
comparison. These intervals were selected based on
preliminary data demonstrating a change in pancreatic cancer treatment in 1995 (Fig. 1). Patients were
grouped by treatment combination received: surgery
alone, surgery and radiation, surgery and chemotherapy, surgery and chemoradiation, radiation alone,
chemotherapy alone, and chemoradiation alone.
Surgery is defined as a cancer-directed resection
including pancreaticoduodenectomy (with or without
pylorus preservation), distal pancreatectomy, total
pancreatectomy, and pancreatectomy not otherwise
specified.17,18 Palliative procedures and exploratory
surgery without a cancer-directed resection are not
included in our analysis. If a patient is reported by
more than 1 hospital, the less complete of the duplicate records is eliminated to ensure that patients are
not represented twice in the dataset.

Hospital Classification
Hospitals in the NCDB are classified into academic
and community cancer centers based on case volume and services offered.19 Academic hospitals must
be affiliated with teaching and research institutions,
meet annual case-volume requirements, and fulfill
criteria regarding the ability to provide a wide range
of cancer-specific services. For analysis, Community
and Comprehensive Community Cancer Centers
were grouped together and compared with Teaching/
Research/Academic Hospitals. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) is a consortium of
19 major adult comprehensive cancer centers in the
U.S. One of their primary goals is to develop treat-

Multimodality Therapy for Pancreatic CA/Bilimoria et al.

ment guidelines for all body sites including pancreatic cancer.20 The NCDB contains 17 of the 19 NCCN
hospitals. In addition, the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) designates cancer centers, and the NCDB contains 33 of the 61 NCI centers. NCCN and NCI hospitals were combined for the analysis. Hospitals were
characterized as being in metropolitan versus urban/
rural locations. Urban and rural were combined due
to the small number of rural hospitals that report to
the NCDB. Metropolitan, urban, and rural were
defined by county population and proximity to major
cities per the 2003 Urban-Rural Continuum Codes.21
Hospital volume was based on the annual volume of all pancreatic cancer cases (analytic cases)
reported to the NCDB annually, including surgical
and nonsurgical patients. Quartiles were determined
based on having equal numbers of hospitals within
each quartile. However, this led to 49.9% of the pancreatic cancer cases being seen at institutions in the
top quartile, with case volume ranging from 13 to
300 patients per year within that top quartile. Thus,
quartiles were recalculated based on having equal
numbers of cases per quartile. This led to a more
even distribution where the top quartile consisted of
38 hospitals that saw 25% of cases annually and volume ranged from 82 to 300 patients per year in this
top quartile. All analyses were performed with both
quartile determinations, but as the results were
similar, only the latter method is presented. We
define ‘high-volume’ centers as the top quartile hospitals with patients are evenly distributed within
quartiles.

Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were compared with the chisquare test. The Bonferroni correction was used for
multiple comparisons. Graphs and tables were used
as needed to examine the distribution of each variable. Binary logistic regression models were used to
identify hospital factors predicting treatment type
while adjusting for gender, age (<55 years, 55–64
years, 65–74 years, and 75 years), race (white,
black, Asian, Hispanic, and other), extent of surgery
(pancreaticoduodenectomy, distal pancreatectomy,
and total pancreatectomy), AJCC 6th edition stage
(I vs II), and year of diagnosis (1985–1989, 1990–
1995, 1996–1999, and 2000–2003). Five-year overall
survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method
and modalities were compared using the log-rank
test.22 Cox proportional hazards modeling was utilized to assess the impact of surgery and adjuvant
therapy on survival while controlling for gender,
age (<55 years, 55–64 years, 65–74 years, and 75
years), race (white, black, Asian, Hispanic, an

were confirmed graphically. The level of statistical
significance was set to P < .001. All P values
reported are 2-tailed. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 14; SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
For the diagnoses years 1985 through 2003, the
NCDB contained data regading 306,796 pancreatic
cancer patients, of whom 301,033 had histologies
that were consistent with adenocarcinoma. Patients
were divided into 2 groups for statistical comparison:
1985 through 1994 (n 5 126,891 patients) and 1995
through 2003 (n 5 174,142 patients). Patient demographics and tumor variables did not change significantly between the 2 time periods (Table 1).
Moreover, the stage of presentation did not differ
considerably over time.

From 1985 through 1994 to 1995 through 2003,
the percentage of all patients receiving treatment for
pancreatic cancer increased from 45.1% to 51.8%
(P < .001). Cancer-directed therapy was evaluated for
patients presenting with localized disease (stage I
and stage II). Pancreatectomy for localized disease
increased from 37.2% to 49.7% (P < .001) (Fig. 1,
Table 2). This increase was observed in conjunction
with adjuvant therapy as the use of surgery alone
decreased from 62.1% to 49.9% (P < .001) of resected

patients. Of those patients who underwent curative
resection, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy alone
increased from 4.1% to 5.7% (P < .001). However, the
use of adjuvant radiation alone decreased from 7.0%
to 4.6% (P < .001). Adjuvant chemoradiation use
increased from 26.8% to 38.7% (P < .001).
In all patients with localized pancreatic cancer
(n 5 66,663), the total proportion of patients receiving adjuvant therapy in any combination increased
from 1985 through 1994 to 1995 through 2003; the
use of chemotherapy increased from 31.0% to 40.4%
(P < .001) and the use of radiation therapy increased
from 32.5% to 36.4% (P < .001) (Fig. 2).
The impact of hospital type and volume on utilization was analyzed separately for surgery and adjuvant therapy. Patients with localized pancreatic
cancer were more likely to undergo pancreatectomy
at academic compared with community institutions
(54.5% vs 39.5%; P < .001) (Table 3). Patients with
localized pancreatic cancer were also more likely to
receive adjuvant chemoradiation at academic compared with community institutions (18.4% vs 15.3%;
P < .001) (Table 4). Multimodality therapy was
employed more often at higher-volume centers
(P < .001). Patients treated at NCCN/NCI hospitals
underwent surgery and received adjuvant therapy
more often than patients treated at other academic
or community centers (P < .001). Facilities in metropolitan areas were more likely to utilize surgery and

adjuvant therapy than those hospitals in urban/rural
settings (P < .001). Geographic location demonstrated significant differences in the utilization of
surgery and adjuvant therapy. Patients in the Great
Lakes and Northeast census regions were more likely
to receive multimodality therapy for localized pancreatic cancer (P < .001). Multivariate analysis controlling for stage and age demonstrated that facility
type and volume (academic centers, NCCN/NCI
centers, high-volume hospitals) were independent
predictors of increased utilization of surgery and adjuvant therapy (P < .001).
Finally, we sought to investigate the impact of
surgery and adjuvant therapy on survival. The unadjusted 5-year survival rate was 16.3% for patients
who underwent surgery alone (median survival, 13.1
months) (Fig. 3) (Table 5). The 5-year survival rate
for patients treated with surgery combined with
adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy was

alone, or no treatment. Survival between all 3 groups is highly significant
(P < .0001 for all pairwise comparisons).

18.8% (median survival, 17.0 months). For patients
who did not undergo surgery, the 5-year survival was
3.5% (median survival, 6.5 months). Cox proportional
hazards modeling controlling for patient, tumor, and
hospital characteristics demonstrated that survival
was better with surgery and adjuvant therapy
(hazards ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0.42–0.47) and surgery alone (HR, 0.54;
95% CI, 0.52–0.57) compared with those who were
not selected to undergo surgical treatment. Moreover,
patients who underwent surgery with adjuvant therapy had better adjusted survival than patients who
underwent surgery alone (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79–0.88
[P < 0.001]).

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic cancer is a formidable disease, and identifying factors that affect outcomes is critical to
improving cancer care and the delivery of stage-specific treatments. To our knowledge, the current
study is the largest study regarding pancreatic cancer performed to date and the first to investigate
the utilization of multimodality therapy by hospital
type. This study demonstrates that over the past 20
years there has been an increase in the utilization of
surgery and adjuvant therapy for localized pancreatic cancer, particularly at academic centers, highvolume hospitals, and NCCN/NCI-designated cancer centers.

Treatment Utilization
Reports from numerous institutions have demonstrated that pancreatectomy can be performed safely
and results in improved outcomes in properly
selected patients.2,4,5,8–10 A previous report from the
NCDB examined treatment utilization in patients
diagnosed between 1985 and 1995 and found that
pancreatectomy was utilized in 21.9%.24 Recent studies have demonstrated increased utilization of surgery over time.25,26 Our results also demonstrate a
gradual increase in surgery from 1985 to 2003. However, the use of surgery alone has decreased; thus,
the increase in utilization of surgery is observed in
conjunction with an increase in adjuvant therapy.
Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated
the improved efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy
treatment.11–14 Prior studies utilizing the NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program have not been able to investigate chemotherapy
utilization because SEER does not report information regarding systemic therapies.25,26 We found that
adjuvant chemotherapy utilization has increased
over time, particularly in conjunction with adjuvant
radiation therapy.
Baxter et al.25 utilized SEER to evaluate adjuvant
radiation therapy use and found that utilization
increased over time. When examined with information on chemotherapy utilization, we found that use
of radiation alone actually decreased over time and
that the increase in adjuvant radiation has been considered to be multimodality therapy, in which chemotherapy and radiation are used together.
Together, these results indicate that surgery and
multimodality therapy are being used with increasing
frequency for localized pancreatic cancer. This may
be attributable to the numerous studies demonstrating improved perioperative morbidity and long-term
survival after resection.2–6,8–10 Similarly, the increased
utilization of adjuvant therapy may be the result of
multiple randomized clinical trials demonstrating a
survival benefit.11–14,27

Hospital Type
Numerous studies have demonstrated a volume/outcome relation for perioperative mortality and longterm survival after surgery for pancreatic cancer.28–32
However, less is known regarding factors contributing
to the volume/outcome relationship. To our knowledge, no prior studies have examined pancreatectomy and adjuvant therapy utilization by hospital
type. We found that pancreatectomy was used more
often at high-volume centers, academic institutions,
and NCCN/NCI-designated cancer centers. These
findings may suggest that more frequent utilization
of surgery and adjuvant treatments at these specialized centers underlie the improved outcomes at
these hospitals.
Survival
Due to the poor prognosis and relative absence of
long-term survivors, many have questioned the utility of multimodality therapy for pancreatic cancer.6,33
However, surgical resection and adjuvant chemoradiation have been shown to be powerful predictors
of survival.6,34 Similarly, we found that survival was
significantly better for patients treated with surgery
compared with those who were not selected to
undergo resection. Moreover, patients selected to
undergo multimodality therapy demonstrated better
survival than those patients who underwent resection alone. Thus, surgery and adjuvant therapy are
effective stage-specific treatments associated with
improved outcomes.
Limitations
Our study has several potential limitations. Underreporting is a systematic bias associated with registry
data.35–38 Underreporting may lead to underestimation of the percentage of patients receiving adjuvant
therapies, particularly because these treatments may
be administered on an outpatient basis months after
surgery.37 Studies attempting to quantify the reporting disparity by comparing registry data to patient

Multimodality Therapy for Pancreatic CA/Bilimoria et al.

charts and Medicare claims have shown that the
underreporting ranges from 5% to 12% for chemotherapy and radiation depending on the cancer
site.35,37,39,40 However, we excluded unknowns and
evaluated proportions of patients receiving surgery
and adjuvant treatments to demonstrate trends in
treatment over time. Adjuvant therapy may be underreported if a patient receives treatment at multiple
hospitals. However, if a patient undergoes surgery at
Hospital A and chemotherapy at Hospital B, the
Institution A cancer registrar accesses information
from Hospital B or the physician’s office record. An
additional limitation is that the NCDB started collecting data describing secondary diagnoses (comorbidities) in 2003. As a result, we were unable to riskadjust for specific comorbidities in this study.41–43
Our logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards
models controlled for numerous factors including
age, race, stage, and facility type. Prior studies concerning pancreatic cancer using administrative data
have reported that high-volume, academic centers
are more likely to see patients with worse coexisting
illnesses (based on higher Charlson Comorbidity
Index scores) than low-volume or community hospitals.29,44–47 Thus, the finding that patients seen at
high-volume, academic institutions receive surgery
more frequently would likely be more pronounced
with risk adjustment for comorbidities. A further limitation of this study is that we were only able to
study cancer-directed surgery (ie, pancreatectomy)
because information regarding palliative surgery and
exploration without resection is limited in cancer
registries. Thus, we focused on patients undergoing
cancer-directed surgery for localized disease (stages I
and II) with curative intent. In addition, the NCDB
collects data from hospitals that are approved by the
CoC, which may introduce a patient selection bias
because smaller hospitals may not be CoC-approved.
Low-volume, community hospitals in the NCDB may
have a higher level of specialization compared with
hospitals in the U.S. that are not approved by the
CoC. This may decrease the differences observed in
the current study between high-volume, academic
hospitals in comparison to low-volume, community
hospitals; however, at the national level, this would
only further the findings that there are differences in
treatment utilization between hospital types. Furthermore, differences in utilization by facility type may
be due in part to regionalization of pancreatic cancer
care. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the
impact of regionalization on utilization of pancreatectomy in the U.S. Finally, we compared survival in
patients who underwent surgery with those who
received adjuvant therapy, surgery alone, and no sur-

1233

gery. These comparisons are retrospective and suffer
from a selection bias. They offer some insight into
the issue, but further evaluation in prospective studies is required.

Conclusions
As a result of multiple institutional studies over the
past 20 years demonstrating the increased safety and
efficacy of pancreatic surgery, the utilization of curative resection for localized pancreatic cancer is on the
rise. Furthermore, multiple randomized clinical trials
have advocated the employment of adjuvant chemoradiation, and the results of the current study demonstrate that multimodality therapy utilization is
increasing as well. Patients receiving surgery and adjuvant therapy also had better outcomes. Despite
these favorable findings, a large percentage of patients
with early-stage disease are not receiving appropriate,
stage-specific treatments. Thus, there is an opportunity to improve cancer care by offering stage-specific
treatment to appropriate pancreatic cancer patients.
Adhering to national consensus guidelines such as
those put forth by the NCCN may improve the utilization of treatment for pancreatic cancer.20 Alternatively, the regionalization of pancreatic cancer care to
centers of excellence may be warranted. Further
investigation is needed to characterize this underutilization of treatment in the U.S.
