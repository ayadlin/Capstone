BACKGROUND. Central venous catheter (CVC) placement increases the risk of
thrombosis and subsequent death in patients with cancer. The objective of this
systematic review was to determine the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation in
reducing mortality and thromboembolic events in cancer patients with a CVC.

METHODS. The authors searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ISI the Web of Science databases.
They included randomized controlled trials in patients with cancer comparing
unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), vitamin K
antagonists, fondaparinux, or ximelagatran with no intervention, placebo, or each

venous thrombosis (DVT) (relative risk (RR), 0.43; 95% confidence interval (95%
CI), 0.18–1.06), but there was no statistically significant effect on mortality (RR,
0.74; 95% CI, 0.40–1.36), infection (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.36–2.28), major bleeding
(RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.10–4.78), or thrombocytopenia (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.49–1.46).
The effect of warfarin on symptomatic DVT also was not statistically significant
(RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.30–1.27).

CONCLUSIONS. The balance of benefits and downsides of thromboprophylaxis in
cancer patients with CVC are uncertain. Clinicians together with their patients
must weigh these factors carefully when making decisions regarding thrombopro-

P

atients with cancer often require a long-term
central venous catheter (CVC) to receive chemotherapy, transfusions, parenteral nutrition, and antibiotics. Although patients with cancer have a 4- to 6fold increased risk of thrombosis compared with the
general population,1–4 the placement of a CVC further increases this risk.2 Cancer treatments, including
surgery, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy, also
increase the risk of thrombosis.5 Consequently, the
incidence of clinically overt, CVC-related deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with cancer can
be as high as 28%.6 The incidence of clinically overt
pulmonary embolism (PE) in cancer patients with
CVC-related DVT varies between 15% and 25%.6
Thromboembolic complications in patients with
cancer can lead to significant morbidity and mortality.7 Indeed, in patients with cancer, venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with a 2-fold
increase in mortality.8 In addition, patients with cancer who are treated for VTE have higher thrombosis
recurrence rates and more hemorrhagic complications compared with patients without cancer who
are treated for VTE.9,10 In a study of patients with
VTE on anticoagulation, both recurrence and bleeding were related to cancer status and to cancer severity but could not be explained by under- or overanticoagulation.10 In addition, thrombosis often
necessitates the removal of the CVC, resulting in significant treatment delays.11
A 2003 systematic review of thromboprophylaxis
in patients with CVC identified 2 randomized clinical
trials (RCTs) that were conducted in patients with cancer.12 In the first study, Bern et al. demonstrated that,
compared with placebo, warfarin reduced the risk
thrombosis in patients who were receiving chemotherapy for either hematologic or solid malignancies (relative risk [RR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],
0.11–0.88).13 In the second study, Monreal et al.
reported that, compared with no prophylaxis, dalteparin prophylaxis reduced the risk of thrombosis in
patients with solid tumors (RR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.02–
1.22).14 Although those 2 studies together strongly
favored thromboprophylaxis, since their publication,
several additional RCTs addressing this question have
been published.15-18 Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to determine the efficacy and safety of
anticoagulation in reducing mortality and thromboembolism in patients with cancer and with a CVC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Searching
We electronically searched the following databases:
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials

(CENTRAL; Issue 1, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 onward;
accessed through OVID), EMBASE (1980 onward;
accessed through OVID), and ISI the Web of Science.
We combined terms for cancer with terms for anticoagulation by using the Boolian operator AND and
applied a filter for RCTs (strategy available from the
authors). The search date was January 2007.
We also hand searched the conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,
starting with its first volumein 1982, and of the
American Society of Hematology (ASH) (starting with
the 2003 issue). We reviewed the reference lists of
articles resulting from the above searches and used
the related article feature in PubMed to identify additional articles. We used no language restrictions.

Selection
Two reviewers independently screened the titles and
abstracts of identified articles for eligibility. We
retrieved the full texts of articles that were judged
potentially eligible by at least 1 reviewer. Two
reviewers then independently screened the full text
articles for eligibility by using a standardized form
and resolved their disagreements by discussion or by
consulting a third reviewer. We included abstracts
only if authors supplied us with the necessary information regarding their methods and results.
We included studies that were RCTs in patients
with cancer and had a CVC but no clinical evidence
of VTE at enrollment. We excluded observational studies, reviews, editorials, and letters. The RCT had to
assess 1 of 5 classes of anticoagulants: unfractionated
heparin
(UFH),
low-molecular-weight
heparin
(LMWH), vitamin K antagonists (VKA), fondaparinux,
and ximelagatran. Outcomes included all-cause mortality (primary outcome), premature CVC removal,
catheter-related bacteremia, catheter exit-site infection (we did not consider catheter colonization), CVC
site DVT, non-CVC site DVT, PE, major bleeding,
minor bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT). We included
catheter-related infection as an outcome because of
the potential beneficial effect of anticoagulation.19

Validity Assessment
We assessed the following methodologic quality criteria: allocation concealment, blinding (patient, provider, outcome assessor, data analyst), whether there
was a priori sample size calculation, whether the
analysis followed the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, whether the study was stopped early for benefit
or harm, and the percentage of follow-up.

Data Abstraction
We developed and used a standardized data-extraction form. Two reviewers independently extracted the
data from each included study and resolved their disagreements by discussion or by consulting a third
reviewer. We contacted the trial authors for incompletely reported data.
Study Characteristics
Our objective was to collect, in addition to the methodologic quality criteria, the characteristics of participants (number of patients in each study arm,
population characteristics, history of VTE prerandomization, and cancer characteristics), CVC (type, site,
placement side, type of medication/fluids infused,
specialty of physician placing the CVC, antibiotic
coverage with placement and antiseptic technique),
interventions (type of anticoagulant, the comparison,
dose of anticoagulant, initiation of treatment relative
to time of CVC insertion, and treatment duration),
and outcomes. We extracted the outcome data necessary to conduct ITT analyses. Our aim was to report
outcome data at 3 months and 6 months, but we
extracted data at any time point they were reported.
Diagnoses of catheter-related bacteremia and
catheter exit-site infection had to be based on predefined criteria. The diagnosis of CVC-related thrombosis could be made either from screening or based on
clinical suspicion with subsequent confirmation by 1
of the described tests. DVT and PE events had to be
diagnosed by using objective diagnostic tests. For the
evaluation of bleeding complications and thrombocytopenia, we accepted the trial authors’ definitions
as long as they were included.
Quantitative Data Synthesis
We calculated the agreement between reviewers for
the assessment of trial eligibility by using the k statistic. Applying the ITT principle, we calculated the
RR of outcomes of interest separately for each trial.
We measured homogeneity across trial results by
using the I2 statistic, which describes the percentage
of total variation across studies that is caused by heterogeneity rather than chance.20 We considered the
following classification of heterogeneity based on the
value of I2: 0 to 30, low; 30 to 60, moderate and worthy of investigation; 60 to 90, severe and worthy of
understanding; 90 to 100, allowing aggregation only
with major caution (unpublished data). We used the
random effects to pool the results within each of the
5 classes of drugs. We created inverted funnel plots
to evaluate possible publication bias. Finally, we calculated the optimal information size (sample size
needed to reliably detect a plausible treatment effect)

2485

assuming a control event rate and an RR reduction
for venous thrombosis equal to those of the results
of the meta-analysis with 80% power and a 2-sided
a 5 .05.
When heterogeneity was greater than moderate,
we attempted to explain it by conducting subgroup
analyses. The a priori factors to explain heterogeneity
were the characteristics of participants (adult vs pediatric, solid vs hematologic cancer, type of catheter),
outcomes (symptomatic vs screening-detected DVT,
early vs late DVT) and methodologic quality (allocation concealment and blinding). Finally, we conducted a post-hoc analysis by combining all studies
that compared any type of anticoagulation (LMWH,
UFH, or warfarin) with no anticoagulation in adults.

RESULTS
Trial Flow
Figure 1 shows the trial flow. Agreement between
reviewers for study eligibility was excellent (k 5
0.94). The search strategy identified 3986 citations,
including 322 duplicates. The title and abstract
screening of the 3664 unique citations identified 42
as potentially eligible. The full text screening of the
42 studies identified 17 potentially eligible RCTs and
excluded the other 25 studies for the following reasons: 1 RCT was published as an abstract but had a
follow-up rate of 77% (<80% was the predefined cutoff)21; in 1 RCT, patients were followed for 3 months
after catheter removal, resulting in a differential follow-up relative to randomization (63 days for the
warfarin group and 84 days for the placebo group)16;
13 studies were not RCTs; 4 reports were reviews; 2
reports were editorials or letters to the editor; in 2
studies, the intervention used was not relevant; and,
in 2 studies, the intervention was compared with
urokinase.
Of the 17 potentially eligible reports, we included
9 RCTs in the systematic review13–15,17,18,22–25 and
excluded the remaining 8 reports for the following
reasons: 3 studies were published as abstracts for
which we were not able to obtain the needed data
from the authors26–28; 1 study in which patients with
cancer constituted a subgroup for which we were not
able to obtain the needed data from the authors29; 3
studies were published as abstracts and later as full
reports that we included in this review30–32; and 1
was a secondary publication33 of an already included
RCT.15
Study Characteristics
The 9 studies randomized a total of 2083 participants
and reported follow-up data on 1966 patients (Table 1).

FIGURE 1. The trial flow. RCT indicates randomized clinical trial.
Three studies assessed LMWH,14,17,24 1 study
assessed UFH,15 4 studies assessed warfarin,13,22,23,25
and 1 study compared LMWH with warfarin.18 None
of the RCTs that were included assessed fondaparinux or ximelagatran as the intervention. Most studies
administered treatments for a fixed period or until
CVC removal or thrombosis diagnosis. Studies varied
in the thromboembolic outcomes they assessed (eg,
whether thrombosis was symptomatic or not, at the
site of the catheter or not, related to CVC or not) and
in the definitions of CVC-related infection.
The methodologic quality varied. All but 2 studies adequately concealed allocation.14,24 All but 1
study18 reported a priori sample size calculation.
Three studies blinded patients and caregivers,15,17,24
1 study blinded caregivers,23 7 studies blinded outcome assessors,13–15,17,18,23,24 and 4 studies blinded
data analysts.14,15,18,22 The percentage of follow-up
varied but generally was high (range, 85%-100%). All
but 2 studies13,14 conducted ITT analyses.

Quantitative Data Synthesis
The heterogeneity across trial results was low to
moderate. The relatively small number of trials precluded subgroup analyses other than those based on
anticoagulant type. However, variability in these trials
could account for some of the observed heterogeneity in the findings. The inverted plot funnel for
symptomatic DVT did not suggest publication bias
(Fig. 2).

Heparin
Based on pooled estimates from 4 RCTs,14,15,17,24 heparin (LMWH or UFH) was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in death (RR, 0.74; 95%
CI, 0.40–1.36 [I2 5 0%]), symptomatic DVT (RR, 0.43;
95% CI, 0.18–1.06 [I2 5 23%]) (Fig. 3), asymptomatic
DVT (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.51–1.32 [I2 5 0%]), thrombocytopenia (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.49–1.46 [I2 5 0%]), or
infection (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.36–2.28 [I2 5 0%]).
None of the included studies evaluated HIT. In total,
12 major bleeding events were reported in 2 of the 4
RCTs that tested heparin,15,17 demonstrating no
increase in major bleeding (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.10–
4.78 [I2 5 0%]). The optimal information size
(assuming a control event rate of 6% and an RR of
0.43 for symptomatic DVT) was 1100 patients. Data
for 852 patients were available for this meta-analysis.
After excluding the study that evaluated UFH,15
the pooled estimates from the 3 RCTs that evaluated
LMWH compared either with placebo or with no
intervention also demonstrated no statistically significant reduction in the rates of death (RR, 0.73; 95%
CI, 0.39-1.36 [I2 5 0%]), symptomatic DVT (RR, 0.49;
95% CI, 0.17–1.39 [I2 5 33%]), or asymptomatic DVT
(RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.52–1.36 [I2 5 0%]).
VKA
We did not include the study by Ruud et al. in the metaanalysis given its focus on the pediatric population.23
That study was stopped early because of a higher incidence of ultrasound-detected VTE in the warfarin group
(15 of 31 patients vs 17 of 42 patients; P 5 .36). There
was only 1 symptomatic VTE event in each group.
The pooled estimate from the 3 studies that evaluated a fixed, 1-mg daily dose of warfarin in
adults13,22,25 demonstrated no statistically significant
reduction in symptomatic DVT (RR, 0.62; 95% CI,
0.30–1.27 [I2 5 34%]) (Fig. 4). The optimal information size (assuming a control event rate of 9.4% and
an RR of 0.62 for symptomatic DVT) was 1730
patients in total. Data for 1007 patients were available for this meta-analysis. No data were available
for the mortality outcome.
VKA Versus Heparin
The RCT that compared fixed low-dose warfarin (1
mg daily) with nadroparin (prophylactic dose)18
demonstrated no statistically significant difference
between the 2 agents for death at 90 days (RR, 0.64;
95% CI, 0.20–2.05), death at 6 months (RR, 0.48; 95%
CI, 0.19–1.24), CVC removal (RR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.07–
15.21), VTE at 90 days (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.18–3.05),
bleeding (RR, 0.32; 95% 0.01–7.61), or thrombocytopenia (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.05–5.05).

Any Anticoagulant
In the post-hoc analysis that combined all 7 adult
studies comparing any type of anticoagulation
(LMWH, UFH, or warfarin) with no anticoagulation,13–15,17,22,24,25 a statistically significant reduction
was observed in symptomatic DVT (RR, 0.56; 95% CI,
0.34–0.92 [I2 5 19%]) (Fig. 5). However, there were
no statistically significant differences reported
between anticoagulation and no anticoagulation for
the outcomes of death (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.40–1.36
[I2 5 0%]), asymptomatic DVT (RR, 0.82; 95% CI,
0.51–1.32 [I2 5 0%]), infection (RR, 1.11; 95% CI,
0.73–1.68 [I2 5 0%]), or major bleeding (RR, 1.83;
95% CI, 0.34–9.87 [I2 5 27%]).
When all studies were considered, there was a
noticeable decrease in the baseline risk of symptomatic DVT by year of publication: The control group
risk decreased from earlier studies (24% in the study
by Bern et al.13; 39% in the study by Monreal et al.14)

DISCUSSION
In this systematic review, we observed that the use of
heparin in cancer patients with a CVC was associated
with a trend toward lower rates of symptomatic DVT.
However, there were no differences in the rates of
death, infection, bleeding, or thrombocytopenia. The
effect of warfarin on symptomatic DVT was not statistically significant. When all studies that assessed
different types of anticoagulants were pooled together, symptomatic DVT rates were significantly
lower with an RR of 0.56. We did not identify any
RCTs that evaluated fondaparinux or ximelagatran as
the anticoagulant.
Our systematic approach to searching, study
selection, and data extraction followed that of the
Cochrane Collaboration. The overall methodologic
quality of the studies that were included can be
judged as acceptable. Our systematic approach, the
acceptable overall methodologic quality, combined
with the consistency of the results (lack of significant
heterogeneity) and the low likelihood of publication
bias, increase the confidence in the internal validity
of our findings. One limitation of this study is that
the lack of effect may be related to the small number
of RCTs, the small number of studied patients and
events, and the absence of a true effect. Another
limitation related to the small number of RCTs is our
inability to conduct subgroup analyses exploring the
impact of the characteristics of participants (adult vs
pediatric, solid vs hematologic cancer, type of catheter), outcomes (symptomatic vs screening-detected
DVT, early vs late DVT), and methodologic quality
criteria (allocation concealment and blinding) on the
treatment effect.

The decrease in the baseline risk of symptomatic
DVT by year of publication is very interesting. This
decline may reflect technological advances in CVC
material and design, better CVC management strategies (eg, port flushing), and advances in clinical care
in general (eg, early mobilization of patients).
There also was a progressive decrease in the
effect size by year of publication, particularly in studies of heparin therapy. A similar decrease in effect
size was observed in studies of mental health as
more trials of the same topics were published.34 The
smaller size of earlier studies13,14 provides a possible
explanation for this phenomenon in our review,
because it has been reported that small trials exaggerate intervention effects compared with large
trials.35 Another potentially contributing explanation
is the early stopping of the study by Monreal et al.14
for benefit; Montori et al. have demonstrated that
RCTs that are stopped early for benefit show implausibly large treatment effects.36 In either case, the existence of these small trials limits our confidence in
the effect estimates.
A systematic review of thrombosis prophylaxis in
populations with CVC (search date, May 2002) examined the population of patients with cancer.12 That
review identified 2 of the RCTs included in the current review13,14 and concluded that low-dose warfarin and LMWH significantly reduce the incidence of
catheter-related thrombosis. There are several possible explanations for the discrepancy between the
conclusions of the 2 reviews. First, patients with DVT
in those 2 studies included patients with screeningdetected, asymptomatic DVT; after restricting the
analysis to patients with symptomatic DVT, the effect
estimates in these 2 studies decrease and become
nonsignificant for the study by Monreal et al.14 Second, higher numbers of participants and smaller
effect sizes in more recently published studies may

Cancer and Catheter Thromboprophylaxis/Akl et al.

have decreased the pooled effect size compared with
the 2 initial studies (as discussed above).
In a systematic review of the benefits of heparin
in patients with CVCs not restricted to cancer (search
date, October 1995), Randolph et al. demonstrated
that prophylactic heparin decreases CVC-related venous thrombosis (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23–0.78) and
bacterial colonization of CVC (RR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06–
0.60) and may decrease catheter-related bacteremia
(RR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07–1.03).37 Those authors did not
report any bleeding outcomes. Although their
reported reduction in venous thrombosis was compatible with the findings in the current review,
patients with cancer are different from other patients
in terms of comorbidities, response to anticoagulation, and the purpose and duration of use of CVCs.
At the same time, there is evidence suggesting that
both heparin and warfarin may offer a survival benefit in subgroups of patients with cancer independent
of their thrombosis-related therapeutic effect.38,39
Furthermore, although we did not detect a statistically significant increase in bleeding risk, there is little doubt that anticoagulation increases hemorrhagic
risk in most populations.
In accordance with the Seventh American College of Chest Physicians Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy,40 our findings suggest
that clinicians do not routinely use thromboprophylaxis in patients with cancer and CVCs (grade 2B; ie,
a weak recommendation). The physicians who make
decisions regarding anticoagulation for patients with
CVCs have to keep in mind that, despite the absence
of a statistically significant result, the plausible range
of the effect of heparin therapy on symptomatic DVT
based on the 95% CI ranges from an RR of 0.18 to
1.06 with the point estimate of RR, 0.43 reflecting the
best estimate. Thus, either an RR reduction as high
as 82% or a slight RR increase of 6% may be
expected. Accordingly, a patient may opt against prophylactic anticoagulation because he is bleeding
averse, anticoagulants (eg, daily subcutaneous injections) would be a burden for him, or he is uncomfortable with the uncertainty of benefit. Another patient
may opt for prophylactic anticoagulation because
she has a low aversion to bleeding, she does not consider anticoagulation a burden, and she has a high
preference for avoidance of thrombosis (and the
associated increased risk of a pulmonary embolism,
a premature CVC removal, and the need to start
relatively long therapeutic anticoagulation). Decision makers need to take this uncertainty into
account. At the same time, they need to consider the
finding that the results are consistent across the 3
types of anticoagulants.

Future studies should explore the effects of
anticoagulants further, including the newer drugs,
such as fondaparinux and ximelagatran, in cancer
patients with CVCs. Reaching the optimal information size of 1100 patients for evaluating the effect of
heparin on the prevention of symptomatic DVT
would require the next RCT to include at least 248
patients, because data for 852 patients were available
for this meta-analysis. Studies also should adhere to
high methodologic quality and should be powered
properly to assess patient-important outcomes, such
as death, premature CVC removal, symptomatic
thrombosis, and bleeding. Studies also should use
standardized definitions for major and minor bleeding and for catheter-related infections. Research
should demonstrate a definite benefit of anticoagulation before additional studies are conducted comparing the effects of different anticoagulants.
