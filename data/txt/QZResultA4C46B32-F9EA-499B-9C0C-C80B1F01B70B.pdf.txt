Abstract
Smac mimetic compounds targeting the inhibitor of apoptosis
proteins (IAP) baculoviral IAP repeat-3 domain are presumed
to reduce the threshold for apoptotic cell death by alleviating
caspase-9 repression. We explored this tenet in an unbiased
manner by searching for small interfering RNAs that are able
to confer resistance to the Smac mimetic compound LBW242.
Among the screening hits were multiple components of the
tumor necrosis factor A (TNFA) signaling pathway as well as
X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) itself. Here, we show
that in a subset of highly sensitive tumor cell lines, activity of
LBW242 is dependent on TNFA signaling. Mechanistic studies
indicate that in this context, XIAP is a positive modulator of
TNFA induction whereas cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
protein 1 negatively regulates TNFA-mediated apoptosis.

Introduction
Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) are overexpressed in human
cancers where they are thought to antagonize apoptotic cell death
by interacting with and repressing caspase-3, caspase-7, and
caspase-9. The interaction between the baculoviral IAP repeat-3
(BIR3) domain of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) and
caspase-9 is of therapeutic interest because this interaction is
inhibited by the NH2-terminal seven-amino-acid residues of Smac,
a naturally occurring antagonist of IAPs (1). Moreover, the
hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions anchoring the amino
terminus of Smac into the BIR3 binding groove are colinear within
a four-residue motif (AVPI; ref. 1). We and others have generated
small-molecule Smac mimetics anticipating efficacy in cancer
based on reinstitution of apoptotic signaling (2–4). The available
data suggest that there is significant similarity in the structural and
biochemical activities of the current generation of Smac mimetic
small molecules (2, 3, 5). As these compounds enter human clinical
trials, it is critical that we understand the mechanism of activity of
such molecules and develop hypotheses for selecting the appropriate patients or tumor types. Toward this end, a series of studies
were done to explore the mechanism through which a Smac

mimetic compound, LBW242 (Supplementary Fig. S1), induces
apoptosis in tumor cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Recombinant human tumor
necrosis factor a (TNFa), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL),
and soluble TRAIL receptor (sTRAIL-R) were from R&D Systems. For rescue
experiments, cells were pretreated with 1 Ag/mL sTRAIL-R, 1 Ag/mL
etanercept (Amgen/Wyeth), or 1 Ag/mL anti-TNFa antibody (BD PharMingen) 30 min before treatment with LBW242. To evaluate whether
degradation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) was
proteosome dependent, cells were pretreated for 2 h with the proteosome
inhibitor MG132 (6 Amol/L; Calbiochem). The stable nuclear factor-nB
(NF-nB) reporter variant of A549 cells was established with pNFnB-luc
(Panomics) and maintained in 100 Ag/mL hygromycin B. Luciferase was
quantified using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega). Cell viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo (Promega).
RNA interference reagents. For transient knockdown, small interfering
RNAs (siRNA) were obtained from Dharmacon Technologies. Stable
knockdown of XIAP in SKOV-3 cells (XIAP-KD) was achieved by retroviral
transduction of a shRNA using the pCGll vector (core sequence,
5¶-gtcattactttcaagcaaa-3¶).
RNA interference screen. The apoptosis siRNA library was composed of
318 siRNA Smart pool reagents targeting apoptosis-related genes (Dharmacon) as 6.25 pmol of lyophilized siRNA per well in 96-well plates.
Dharmafect2 at 0.28 AL (Dharmacon) diluted in 25-AL DCCR (Dharmacon)
was added per well. MKSTYX (Dharmacon) and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (Dharmacon) siRNAs were added to additional
wells, serving as positive and negative controls, respectively. SKOV-3 cells
(6,000 per well) were plated on the siRNA/lipid reagent complexes (6). After
24 h, cells were treated with LBW242 (20 Amol/L) or vehicle for 72 h and cell
viability was measured as described above.
Validation of RNA interference screen results. SKOV-3 cells were
transfected with original siRNA pools and four individual siRNA duplexes
for selected genes, and viability after LBW242 treatment was assessed as
above [RelA, green fluorescent protein (GFP), XIAP-1, XIAP-2, XIAP-3,
XIAP-4, and XIAP-sp used at 50 nmol/L final concentration; all from
Dharmacon]. Knockdown of mRNA was assessed by reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR). mRNA was isolated using the RNeasy96 kit (Qiagen), treated
with DNase 1, and cDNA was generated using the High Capacity cDNA
Archive kit (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA was quantified using customdesigned primers (Sigma Genosys) and Syber Green on an Applied
Biosystems 7900HT. Changes in TNFa mRNA following compound
treatment were normalized to h-actin and calculated as described (7).
Western blotting. Primary antibodies for immunoblot analyses were
anti-cIAP1 (R&D systems), anti-XIAP (BD Biosciences), anti–proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti–h-actin (Sigma).
Cytokine analysis. TNFa protein was measured using a multiplexed
sandwich ELISA at Endogen Searchlight services (Pierce).

Figure 1. Response to Smac mimetic, LBW242, requires extrinsic apoptosis signaling genes. A, RNAi knockdown of caspase-8 (n; 83% mRNA knockdown; data not
shown) but not caspase-9 (E; 86% mRNA knockdown; data not shown) profoundly rescued SKOV-3 cells from LBW242-induced cell killing compared with cells
transfected with nontargeting siRNA (o). Shown is SKOV-3 cell viability after LBW242 treatment (48 h) relative to untreated cells (viability, percent of control).
B, caspase-8 (top ) and caspase-9 (bottom ) cleavage was assessed by Western blot following treatment with 500 nmol/L LBW242 for the indicated time points.
C and D, to identify additional siRNAs that rescue from LBW242-induced cell death, cells were transfected with a collection of 319 siRNA pools targeting an apoptosisrelated gene set. Changes in growth of cells in replicate wells following treatment (72 h) with either vehicle (C ) or LBW242 (20 Amol/L; D ) were assessed (cell
viability, arbitrary units). Plate means and 2 SDs are indicated with bold and fine lines, respectively.

Results
It is presumed that Smac mimetics activate cell death by
releasing caspase-9 from repression mediated by the BIR3 domain
of XIAP. We and others have observed that the SKOV-3 ovarian
carcinoma and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cell lines are highly
sensitive (IC50, <1 Amol/L) to Smac mimetics (2, 3), yet the SKOV-3
ovarian carcinoma cell line is reported to have one or more defects
in the intrinsic apoptosis signaling arm (8). LBW242 is a Smac
mimetic compound (Supplementary Fig. S1) with IC50 values of
200 and 5 nmol/L versus XIAP and cIAP1, respectively, as
measured in a Smac peptide competitive ELISA (9). By multiple
criteria including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, DNA
fragmentation, and rescue with zVAD, LBW242 was shown to
induce apoptosis in vitro (9). Interestingly, RNA interference
(RNAi) knockdown of caspase-9 had minimal effect on the
response of SKOV-3 cells to LBW242, whereas RNAi knockdown

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

of caspase-8 profoundly rescued SKOV-3 cells from LBW242mediated cell killing (Fig. 1A). Western blot analyses confirmed
that LBW242 treatment of SKOV-3 cells resulted in far more
complete conversion of caspase-8 to its activated form than
caspase-9 (Fig. 1B). Although IAPs do not directly inhibit caspase8 (10), these results suggest that the extrinsic apoptosis signaling
arm is equally, if not more, important than the intrinsic apoptosis
signaling arm in Smac mimetic–mediated cell killing.
To elucidate the mechanism of action underlying the response to
LBW242, we carried out a synthetic rescue screen in which siRNAs
targeting 319 apoptosis-related genes were assayed for the ability to
restore cell viability during exposure to LBW242. SKOV-3 cells were
plated in 96-well plates and transfected with arrayed siRNA pools.
Twenty-four hours later, replicate wells for each siRNA pool were
treated with vehicle (DMSO) or LBW242 (20 Amol/L, representing
the LD90) and incubated for 72 h. With the exception of CFLAR,

Smac Mimetic–Induced Apoptosis Requires TNFa

no siRNA pools significantly affected viability in vehicle-treated
wells (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Table S1). Treatment with LBW242
resulted in significant cell killing, largely unaffected by the
majority of siRNAs tested (compare Fig. 1C and D). MKSTYX, a
phosphatase-like protein required for cell death induced by a broad
range of stimuli including Taxol, cisplatin, and etoposide (11),
served as a positive control for the screen. In addition to MKSTYX,
a handful of additional siRNA pools permitted survival equivalent
to that observed in untreated cells (Fig. 1D).
Consistent with earlier observations, siRNAs targeting caspase8 but not caspase-9 rescued SKOV-3 cells from LBW242 treatment
(Fig. 1D). Knockdown of 35 candidate genes rescued viability as
well as, or better than, caspase-8, many by >2 SDs above the plate
mean. These candidate genes were subjected to further validation.
Hits were considered valid when knockdown of the target mRNA
(>70%) by two or more individual siRNAs was concordant with the
ability to confer cell viability in the presence of LBW242. Ten genes
met this criterion (Supplementary Figs. S2–S4). Unexpectedly, hits

included multiple members of the TNFa signaling pathway (TNFa,
TNFRI, and RIPK1) and XIAP, the presumed target of LBW242.
To determine whether Smac mimetic cellular activity was linked
to TNFa signaling, we investigated whether TNFa expression was
induced by LBW242 treatment in either sensitive or insensitive
tumor cell lines. SKOV-3, MDA-MB-231, SK-MEL5, HCT116, A549,
and C32 represent a range of sensitivities to LBW242 from most to
least sensitive (Fig. 2A). LBW242 treatment induced TNFa mRNA
expression 30- and 50-fold above background in SKOV-3 and
MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively (Fig. 2B). In contrast, TNFa
expression was induced <4-fold in three LBW242 insensitive (IC50,
>25 Amol/L) tumor cell lines (HCT116, A549, and C32). SK-MEL5,
a cell line with moderate sensitivity (IC50, 1 Amol/L), displayed
f10-fold TNFa induction and thus had an intermediate phenotype.
TNFa induction was unaffected by the addition of zVAD-fmk (data
not shown), suggesting that this event occurred before the onset
of caspase activation. No TNFa induction was observed in any cell
lines using LCJ787, a structurally related (Supplementary Fig. S1)

Figure 2. Sensitivity to Smac mimetic, LBW242, correlates with TNFa induction. A, cancer cell viability was measured following treatment with LBW242 (72 h),
and LBW242 EC50 values (mean, n = 3) were plotted. B, TNFa mRNA expression following LBW242 treatment (6 and 24 h) was measured by RT-PCR. TNFa
mRNA induction was determined by comparing LBW242-treated and vehicle-treated cells in three independent experiments and the maximum mean fold change
is plotted. TNFa is required for Smac mimetic (LBW242)–induced cell death. SKOV-3 (C ) and MDA-MB-231 (D ) cancer cell lines were treated with LBW242 alone
(0.1 and 1.0 Amol/L, respectively), LBW242 plus sTRAIL-R (1 Ag/mL), or LBW242 plus TNFa-neutralizing agent, etanercept (1 Ag/mL). Columns, mean percent

Figure 3. LBW242 fails to kill SKOV-3 cells lacking XIAP but profoundly sensitizes them to TNFa. SKOV-3 (A) and XIAP-KD (B) cells were treated with LBW242
in the presence (n) or absence (5) of 10 ng/mL TNFa. Shown is cell viability at 96 h (viability, percent of control). Western blot indicates loss of XIAP protein in XIAP-KD
cells (B, inset ). C, TNFa induction in SKOV-3 cells requires XIAP. SKOV-3 (solid columns ) and XIAP-KD (open columns ) cells were treated with vehicle or LBW242
(20 Amol/L) for 24 h, and secreted TNFa protein (C ) was measured. D, A549 cells stably expressing a NF-nB-luciferase reporter were transfected with the siRNAs
indicated; luciferase was quantified following 72 h culture in the presence (solid columns ) or absence (open columns ) of 10 ng/mL TNFa.

but non–IAP-binding analogue (data not shown). These data
strongly suggest that sensitivity to the Smac mimetic LBW242 is
linked to compound-mediated induction of TNFa.
TNFa is paradoxically able to initiate both survival signaling, via
NF-nB, and apoptosis signaling, via caspase-8 (12). To determine
whether nascent TNFa protein production was required for
initiating apoptosis, SKOV-3 cells were treated with LBW242 in
the presence or absence of the TNFa antagonist etanercept.
Etanercept inhibited LBW242-induced cell killing in all three
sensitive cell lines (Fig. 2C and D, and data not shown). Similar
data were obtained using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody
recognizing TNFa (Supplementary Fig. S6). This effect was specific
for TNFa-neutralizing agents because sTRAIL-R did not affect
LBW242 action in any of the sensitive lines tested (Fig. 2C and D).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

These results indicate that Smac mimetic–induced cell death
requires induction of TNFa expression and activation of the
extrinsic apoptosis pathway.
Although XIAP was thought to be the primary target of Smac
mimetics, it was one of the top siRNA rescue hits identified in our
screen, a result that was completely unanticipated. To further
explore the role of XIAP in mediating sensitivity to Smac mimetics,
a cell line was derived from SKOV-3 (XIAP-KD) in which XIAP
levels were stably reduced with a shRNA (Fig. 3B, inset). Consistent
with the results from the rescue screen, XIAP-KD cells were
resistant to LBW242 (compare Fig. 3A and B).
Because we observed that TNFa seems to be required for Smac
mimetic–induced cell death, we hypothesized that XIAP might be
required for TNFa production. To explore this possibility, we

Smac Mimetic–Induced Apoptosis Requires TNFa

measured TNFa protein in SKOV-3 and XIAP-KD cells in the
presence and absence of LBW242 (Fig. 3C). Indeed, loss of XIAP not
only disrupted LBW242-triggered TNFa induction but also led to
decreased basal TNFa levels. XIAP seems to regulate TNFa
induction at the transcriptional level because LBW242-mediated
induction of TNFa mRNA was ablated in the XIAP-KD cells
(Supplementary Fig. S5).
Because TNFa is a known transcriptional target of NF-nB, we
next asked whether XIAP was required for transcriptional
activation of a NF-nB reporter. A549 cells stably expressing a
NF-nB-luciferase reporter were stimulated with TNFa following
transfection with siRNAs against RelA, GFP, or XIAP. As expected,
knockdown of the NF-nB subunit RelA, but not GFP, significantly
diminished TNFa-stimulated reporter activity (Fig. 3D). Like RelA,
knockdown of XIAP abrogated NF-nB transcriptional activation
(Fig. 3D). Together with recent findings from Lu et al. (13), these
data show a requirement for XIAP in modulating certain NF-nB
transcriptional programs.
If loss of XIAP expression conferred resistance to LBW242
because XIAP was required for compound-induced TNFa production, one would predict that XIAP-KD cells would be resensitized to

LBW242 by the addition of exogenous TNFa. As shown in Fig. 3A
and B, respectively, both SKOV-3 and XIAP-KD cells were resistant
to exogenous TNFa alone. Addition of exogenous TNFa did not
further increase the sensitivity of SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 3A) but
dramatically sensitized XIAP-KD cells to LBW242 (Fig. 3B). The
dose-dependent TNFa-hypersensitizing effect of LBW242 in cells
lacking XIAP argued against the notion that XIAP is the principal
target of Smac mimetics and raised the possibility that an
alternative protein, which normally represses TNFa-mediated
apoptosis, is targeted.
cIAP1 has been reported to negatively regulate TNFa-mediated
apoptosis (14–16). Because a peptide derived from Smac was
shown to facilitate proteosome-mediated degradation of
cIAP1 (17), we asked whether the Smac mimetic LBW242 might
behave similarly. Indeed, LBW242 treatment resulted in the
disappearance of cIAP1 protein but not XIAP (Fig. 4A). This
effect required binding of LBW242 to the BIR3 domain of cIAP1
because LCJ787, a nonbinding analogue (Supplementary Fig. S1),
was inactive in this assay (Fig. 4A). Loss of cIAP1 protein occurred
through a proteosome-mediated process because preincubation
with MG132 completely inhibited degradation (Fig. 4A). To
determine whether cIAP1 loss was requisite for TNFa mediated
cell death in the absence of LBW242, siRNA-mediated knockdowns
of cIAP1 or GFP were done in XIAP-KD cells. Knockdown of cIAP1
had almost no effect on the viability of XIAP-KD cells in the
absence of TNFa (Fig. 4B). In contrast, loss of cIAP1 in the
presence of exogenous TNFa resulted in apoptosis similar to that
observed following LBW242 treatment. This TNFa protective role
seems to be specific for cIAP1 because knockdown of cIAP2 in the
same system did not sensitize to TNFa (data not shown). Because
knockdown of cIAP1 expression combined with exogenous TNFa
phenocopied LBW242 treatment, we propose that cIAP1 loss is
necessary, but not sufficient, for compound action. Together, the
aggregate data argue for a model in which Smac mimetics act by
eliminating cIAP1, an event that is lethal when accompanied by an
XIAP-dependent increase in TNFa production.

Discussion

siRNAs targeting cIAP1 (76% mRNA knockdown; Supplementary Fig. S7) or

Our data support a mechanistic model in which XIAP and cIAP1
play distinct roles in mediating cellular response to Smac mimetics.
XIAP participates in a signaling cascade that positively regulates
TNFa transcription, whereas cIAP1 acts to protect cells from
TNFa-mediated apoptosis. Smac mimetic–mediated destruction of
cIAP1 renders the cells sensitive to TNFa. Whereas TNFa is clearly
a critical driver of Smac mimetic–induced killing, we cannot rule
out whether additional cytokines may be involved.
We speculate that the requirement for XIAP in LBW242mediated killing of SKOV-3 cells stems from the role of XIAP in
NF-nB signaling and TNFa induction. Our observation that XIAP
was required for activation of a NF-nB reporter as well as for
transcription of endogenous TNFa is in agreement with the data of
Lu et al. (13), which showed that the XIAP-TAB1 complex positively
regulates TAK1 kinase activity. This functionality seems to be
conserved evolutionarily because the Drosophila IAP homologue
DIAP2 is required for Imd signaling, a TNFa-like pathway that
modulates innate immunity (18).
Whereas the role of cIAP1 seems to be analogous to the
caspase-8 inhibitor CFLAR, the mechanism through which cIAP1
antagonizes TNFa-mediated apoptosis remains unclear. cIAP1 does
not directly inhibit either caspase-3, caspase-7, or caspase-8 (10, 19).

cIAP1 has been mapped to the TNFa death-induced signaling
complex (DISC) via a direct interaction with TNF receptor–
associated factor 2 (20). Other than cIAP1 itself, we have not
observed significant changes in the total cellular levels of other
DISC components following treatment with LBW242 (data not
shown). It remains possible that through the destruction of cIAP1,
LBW242 modulates the constellation of proteins recruited to
the DISC and consequently affects its function.
Because TNFa induction was not observed when cIAP1 degradation was inhibited by MG132 (data not shown), we suspect that
cIAP1 loss is necessary for TNFa induction. This does not seem to
be sufficient, however, because cIAP1 elimination, but not TNF induction, occurs in IAP antagonist–resistant cells (data not shown).
In summary, we have identified unanticipated roles for cIAP1
and XIAP in TNFa signaling and unveiled cIAP1 as the primary
