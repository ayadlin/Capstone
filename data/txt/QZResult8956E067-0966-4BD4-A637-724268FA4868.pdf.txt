Abstract
p53 mutations are rarely detected in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC), but, paradoxically, these tumors remain highly
resistant to chemotherapy and death receptor–induced death.
Here, we show that the accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α), a critical oncogenic event in CCRCC following
the loss of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein,
leads to Hdm2-mediated suppression of p53. Primary CCRCC
specimens exhibiting strong hypoxic signatures show increased levels of activated nuclear phospho-Hdm2(Ser 166),
which is concomitant with low p53 expression. The abrogation
of Hdm2-p53 interaction using the small-molecule Hdm2
inhibitor nutlin-3 or the downregulation of HIF2α via HIF2αspecific short hairpin RNA or wild-type VHL reconstitution
restores p53 function and reverses the resistance of CCRCC
cells to Fas-mediated and chemotherapy-induced cell death.
These findings unveil a mechanistic link between HIF2α and
p53 and provide a rationale for combining Hdm2 antagonists
with chemotherapy for the treatment of CCRCC. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 3% of all
malignancies, and patients with metastatic RCC have a median
survival of 13 months. The most common form (75%) of kidney
cancer is of the clear cell histology [clear cell renal cell carcinoma
(CCRCC)], which is highly aggressive and unresponsive to radiation
or chemotherapy (1). Surgery by radical or partial nephrectomy is
the most effective treatment option for localized disease. However,
in one third of patients, tumors recur postoperatively as distant
metastases, and only 4% to 6% of these tumors respond to chemotherapy. The standard nonsurgical treatment for advanced CCRCC
has been the administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2). However, a
high-dose IL-2 regimen has a response rate of only 21% and causes
significant toxicities (1). Recently, clinical trials of receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor-2 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor-β

inhibitors sorafenib (Nexavar) and sunitinib (Sutent), have yielded
promising results in clinical trials by prolonging progression-free
survival in ∼70% of patients with metastatic CCRCC. However,
neither drug has had a significant effect on overall patient survival
(1, 2).
The efficacy of most chemotherapies is dependent on a successful execution of p53-mediated apoptosis to override the survival signals acquired by cancer cells (3, 4). Consequently, tumors harboring
p53 mutations are associated with chemoresistance and, in general,
predict a considerably worse patient prognosis in comparison with
malignancies with wild-type p53 (5). Intriguingly, p53 mutations are
infrequently detected in CCRCC (6, 7), but nevertheless, these tumors are very resistant to chemotherapy. Although there is no general consensus, several models have been proposed to explain the
resistance of CCRCC to apoptosis, which may contribute to chemoresistance. For example, CCRCC cells devoid of von HippelLindau (VHL) are resistant to death receptor tumor necrosis factor
receptor–mediated cell death due, at least in part, to the increased
activity of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and downstream NFκB-mediated expression of antiapoptotic proteins (8). Yang and colleagues
showed that VHL acts as an adaptor molecule that binds and promotes the inhibitory phosphorylation of the NFκB agonist Card9 by
casein kinase 2 in a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)–independent
manner. Downregulation of Card9 in VHL−/− CCRCC normalized
NFκB activity and sensitivity to cytokine-induced cell death and attenuated the tumorigenic potential of CCRCC cells (9). The effect of
the other major death receptor Fas-mediated signaling in CCRCC is
unknown. There are limited and conflicting reports about the significance of p53 in CCRCC. In particular, Gurova and colleagues
suggest that p53 is inactive via unknown dominant-negative mechanisms independent of Hdm2 (7, 10), whereas Warburton and
colleagues showed that p53 in several CCRCC cell lines can respond
to UV radiation and is negatively regulated by Hdm2 (10, 11). Furthermore, Hdm2 positivity was found significantly more frequently
in CCRCC tumors of higher grade (12). The presence of a specific
single nucleotide polymorphism in the Hdm2 promoter (SNP309),
which results in elevated Hdm2 transcription and expression (13),
has also been identified to be predictive of poor prognosis and survival in RCC (14). These findings suggest a possible oncogenic involvement of Hdm2 in CCRCC.
Approximately 80% of sporadic CCRCC arise due to the biallelic
inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor protein. In addition,
individuals who inherit one faulty copy of VHL develop a rare
multisystemic VHL cancer syndrome characterized by the development of retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastoma and pheochromocytoma, as well as CCRCC, on loss of the remaining wild-type VHL

allele in a susceptible cell. VHL is the substrate-specifying component of the multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase ECV (elongins B
and C/cullin 2/VHL) that catalyzes the polyubiquitylation of prolyl-hydroxylated HIFα for subsequent destruction via the 26S
proteasome. HIFα is hydroxylated on conserved proline residues
by prolyl-hydroxylase domain–containing enzymes in an oxygendependent manner. Under hypoxia, the unhydroxylated HIFα escapes recognition by VHL and thereby escapes ECV-mediated
degradation. Stabilized HIFα associates with the constitutively
stable partner HIFβ to form an active heterodimeric HIF transcription factor, which binds to hypoxia-responsive elements
located in the promoter/enhancer regions of numerous hypox-

ia-inducible genes to initiate the various adaptive responses
to hypoxia, such as anaerobic metabolism, erythropoiesis, and
angiogenesis (15, 16).
Several lines of evidence have strengthened the notion that
HIF2α stabilization is critical for CCRCC progression. For example,
the inhibition of HIF2α, but not of HIF1α, in CCRCC cells was sufficient to abolish the tumorigenic potential of CCRCC cells in a
mouse xenograft assay (17, 18). Conversely, the stable expression
of nondegradable HIF2α in VHL-reconstituted CCRCC cells overcame the tumor-suppressive role of VHL (17). Moreover, a subset
of CCRCC is caused by an inactivation of TSC1/2 tumor suppressor
complex. The loss-of-function mutations in TSC1/2 result in

increased translation of HIFα via mammalian target of rapamycin–
dependent and –independent mechanisms (19). In the Eker rat
renal tumor model, HIF2α was shown to be upregulated in RCC
with a loss of TSC2 (20). Recently, VHL-null CCRCC exclusively
expressing HIF2α showed elevated c-Myc activity associated with
enhanced proliferation and resistance to replication stress in comparison with CCRCC overexpressing both HIF1α and HIF2α (21).
These observations suggest that whereas HIF1α antagonizes
c-Myc, HIF2α promotes c-Myc activity associated with increased
disease aggressiveness (21). Although these findings further support a critical role of HIF2α in the progression of CCRCC, the role
of HIF2α in chemoresistance is unknown.
Here, we show that HIF2α suppresses p53 expression and function via Hdm2. In patient CCRCC samples, we show an increased
accumulation of nuclear phospho-Hdm2(Ser166) and, correspondingly, negligible levels of p53, and provide evidence that HIF2αdependent Hdm2-mediated suppression of p53 contributes to the
resistance of CCRCC cells to Fas-mediated or chemotherapyinduced cell death. Importantly, CCRCC cells can be rendered
highly sensitive to apoptotic stimuli by restoring p53 function via
pharmacologic Hdm2 inhibitors. These findings provide the first
mechanistic link between HIF2α and p53-dependent resistance
to apoptosis in CCRCC, and support the notion that CCRCC can
be successfully sensitized to conventional chemotherapy if
combined with modalities designed to reactivate p53.

Results
The acquisition of mechanisms promoting resistance to apoptosis is a common feature of all transformed cells. The significance
and deregulation of the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway has been
observed in several cancer types including ovarian (32) and prostate (33) cancers, as well as T-cell leukemia (34). However, the status of Fas-mediated apoptosis in CCRCC is unknown.
Activation of HIF2α is associated with resistance to Fasmediated apoptosis. 786-O (VHL−/−, HIF1α−/−) CCRCC cells ectopically expressing empty plasmid (786-MOCK) or HA-VHL(WT)
(786-VHL) were treated with the agonistic anti–Fas receptor antibody CH-11. 786-VHL(WT) cells were sensitive to CH-11 and
showed high levels of cleaved caspase-3 and 86-kDa PARP cleavage
product, as measures of apoptosis (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1).
In contrast, 786-MOCK cells exhibited very low levels of cleaved
PARP and caspase-3 (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1). As expected,
PARP cleavage inversely correlated with cell viability as measured
by trypan blue exclusion assay (Fig. 1A, graph). Similar results were
obtained using another CCRCC cell line system (RCC4-MOCK and
RCC4-VHL; Supplementary Fig. S2).
VHL promotes the destruction of HIFα via the ubiquitinproteasome pathway. Thus, we asked whether the resistance to
Fas-mediated apoptosis in CCRCC is HIF dependent. 786-O cells
stably reconstituted with wild-type VHL or disease-causing VHL
mutants possessing varying abilities to degrade HIF2α were treated with CH-11 and monitored for cleaved PARP. Similar to 786MOCK, 786-VHL(C162F) (high HIF2α) showed negligible PARP
cleavage on CH-11 treatment (Fig. 1B). However, in response to
CH-11 treatment, 786-VHL(L188V) (low HIF2α) showed significant levels of cleaved PARP, comparable to levels observed in
786-VHL(WT) cells (Fig. 1B). In addition, CH-11 treatment of
786-O cells with stable integration of retrovirus encoding
HIF2α-specific shRNA (786-RetroshHIF2α) showed significantly
higher levels of cleaved PARP in otherwise CH-11–resistant parental 786-O or 786-RetroEMPTY cells (Fig. 1C; data not shown).
Similarly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF2α markedly increased the sensitivity of CCRCC cell lines A498 (VHL −/− ,
HIF1α−/−) and RCC4-MOCK (VHL−/−), the latter of which overexpresses both HIF1α and HIF2α, to CH-11–induced apoptosis
(Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the stabilization of HIF2α
contributes to the resistance of CCRCC to Fas-mediated apoptosis irrespective of HIF1α status. Consistent with this notion,

HIF2α Promotes Chemoresistance of RCC

ectopic expression of HIF2α likewise increased the resistance of
MCF7 breast carcinoma cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis is p53 dependent. p53
influences Fas-mediated apoptosis (35, 36). We asked whether the
HIF2α-dependent sensitivity of CCRCC cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis is dependent on p53 by first determining the levels of p53
and p53 target gene products in 786-MOCK and 786-VHL cells.
786-MOCK cells possess significantly reduced levels of p53 and
p53-regulated gene products PUMA and Noxa in comparison with
786-O cells reconstituted with VHL (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the
loss of VHL leads to the suppression of p53 expression and activity.
Importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous wild-type
p53 in 786-VHL(WT) cells resulted in the diminution of PARP
cleavage on CH-11 treatment (Fig. 2B). In addition, the 786-VHL
isogenic subclone harboring a sporadic inactivating p53(R248W)
mutation (24) exhibited considerable resistance to CH-11–induced
apoptosis similar to 786-MOCK cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that VHL-mediated restoration of p53 activity is required for
Fas-induced apoptosis.
HIF2α suppresses p53 via Akt-mediated activation of Hdm2.
Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hdm2 on
Ser166 or Ser186 leads to nuclear localization of Hdm2 and enhanced
degradation of p53 (37, 38). The activation of Akt is triggered on
Ser473 phosphorylation, which represents a well-established survival
signaling event downstream of growth factor receptors, many of
which, including epidermal growth factor receptor and PDGF receptor, have been shown to be hyperstimulated in response to HIF2αmediated production of secreted growth factors (39–41). Thus, the
overexpression of HIF2α on loss or inactivation of VHL could lead
to downregulation of p53 activity via the Akt/Hdm2 pathway
(see Fig. 3A, left). Consistent with this model, 786-MOCK cells that
overexpress HIF2α showed elevated levels of phospho-Akt(Ser473)
and phospho-Hdm2(Ser166) accompanied by a significant reduction
in p53 levels in comparison with 786-VHL(WT) cells (Fig. 3A, right).
In keeping with the notion that Ser166 phosphorylation promotes
Hdm2 nuclear localization, 786-MOCK cells showed greater levels
of nuclear Hdm2 than 786-VHL cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). To directly assess the contribution of Hdm2 in regulating p53 expression
and function, 786-MOCK cells were treated with nutlin-3, a smallmolecule inhibitor of Hdm2-p53 interaction. Nutlin-3 treatment
resulted in a marked increase in p53 levels and p53 transcriptional

activity as detected by upregulation of the p53 target gene product
PUMA (Fig. 3B). Nutlin-3 treatment likewise increased p53 expression in A498 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). Furthermore, treatment
of 786-MOCK cells with LY294002, a small-molecule negative regulator of Akt (42), resulted in decreased level of phospho-Akt(Ser473),
concomitant with attenuation of phospho-Hdm2(Ser166) level, predictably resulting in increased p53 and PUMA levels (Fig. 3C, left).
Notably, total Hdm2 levels also decreased in the presence of
LY294002 (Fig. 3C), which is consistent with the notion that
Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Hdm2 leads to increased Hdm2
stability (43). To determine whether hypoxia- or HIF2α-dependent
production of growth factors was responsible, at least in part, for the
activation of Akt as evidenced by increased levels of phospho-Akt
(Ser473) in 786-MOCK cells (see Fig. 3A, right), we maintained 786VHL(WT) cells in various conditioned media and subsequently measured phospho-Akt(Ser473) levels (Fig. 3C, right). The treatment of
786-VHL(WT) cells with 786-MOCK (i.e., high HIF2α)–conditioned
media as well as with conditioned medium from 786-VHL(WT) cells
grown under hypoxia (i.e., high HIF2α) resulted in increased levels of
phospho-Akt(Ser473) (Fig. 3C, right). In contrast, treatment with conditioned medium from 786-VHL(WT) cells grown under normoxia
(i.e., low HIF2α) had a comparably negligible effect on phosphoAkt(Ser473) levels (Fig. 3C, right). These results support the notion
that the activation of Akt in CCRCC cells devoid of VHL is driven,
at least in part, by receptor-mediated signaling initiated by
HIF2α-dependent secretion of growth factors. In addition, 786-RetroshHIF2α cells infected with retrovirus-driving shRNA specifically
targeting HIF2α showed a significant reduction in nuclear Hdm2 levels, indicative of reduced phospho-Hdm2(Ser166) levels (Supplementary Fig. S6), and restoration of p53 expression in comparison
with 786-RetroEMPTY cells (Fig. 3D). Similarly, siRNA-mediated
HIF2α knockdown in A498 cells increased p53 levels (Supplementary Fig. S6). These results support a novel link between HIF2α and
p53, in which the stabilization of HIF2α in CCRCC leads to the
suppression of p53 activity via the Akt/Hdm2 pathway.
Primary CCRCC samples exhibit increased phospho-Hdm2
(Ser166) expression and low p53 expression. High levels of intense membranous staining and positive cytoplasmic staining of
a well-established HIF target, CAIX, were observed in CCRCC tumor
cells from all 10 nephrectomy specimens, whereas normal
renal cortex showed an absence of CAIX staining in the glomerulus
and a moderate cytoplasmic staining in the adjacent proximal

convoluted tubules (Fig. 4A). We next assessed phospho-Hdm2
(Ser166) levels and showed that the normal renal cortex displayed
negative nuclear staining of phospho-Hdm2(Ser166) in proximal
convoluted tubular epithelium along with positive nuclear staining
in scattered glomerular epithelial cells and mesangial cells (Fig. 4B,
left). However, tumor cells in 9 of 10 CCRCC nephrectomy samples
exhibited intense nuclear phospho-Hdm2(Ser166) staining patterns
(Fig. 4B, right), showing for the first time an increased nuclear staining of the activated phospho-Hdm2(Ser166) in CCRCC. Normal renal
cortex showed weak nuclear p53 staining in glomerular cells and
tubular epithelium (Fig. 4C, left). Tumor cells in all 10 CCRCC nephrectomy samples showed negative nuclear p53 staining (Fig. 4C,
top right; data not shown). A breast carcinoma specimen served as a
positive control for anti-p53(DO-1) antibody (Fig. 4C, bottom right).
Previous studies have shown that VHL status invariably correlates
with HIF2α expression (21, 44). For example, Turner and colleagues
showed that 94% of VHL-negative tumors overexpress HIF2α (21, 44),

whereas Gordan and colleagues showed that 100% of VHL-negative
tumors overexpress HIF2α (21, 44). Thus, VHL negativity implies
HIF2α overexpression. Therefore, we examined phospho-Hdm2
and p53 status in the context of VHL status on tissue microarray
consisting of 56 quadruplicate representatives of needle-core
CCRCC biopsies (Fig. 4D). Consistent with the above nephrectomy
specimens, the majority (82%) of CCRCCs exhibited negative
p53 staining and the majority (73%) of p53-negative tumors with
known VHL status, as determined by immunohistochemistry and
direct DNA sequencing because subtle mutations could give “falsepositive” VHL immunostaining, was determined to be VHL negative
(Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the majority of phospho-Hdm2(Ser166)–
positive samples showed negative VHL (69%) and negative p53
(63%) profiles (Fig. 4D). These results collectively support the notion
that p53 expression is influenced by VHL/HIF2α via Hdm2.
Suppression of HIF2α restores p53 activity and reverses
chemoresistance of CCRCC. We asked whether the restoration

sensitive to CH-11 treatment in combination with nutlin-3 as
evidenced by a dramatic induction of cleaved PARP (Fig. 5A, lane 4).
Notably, nutlin-3 treatment alone was not sufficient to cause death
in CCRCC cells, as the apoptotic stimulus provided by CH-11 was

required to execute the apoptotic process in the presence of restored p53 expression (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 3 and 4). These results show that the restoration of p53 activity can sensitize
CCRCC devoid of VHL to apoptotic signals.
We therefore asked whether the HIF2α-dependent suppression of
p53 contributes to the chemoresistance of CCRCC because the efficacy of most chemotherapies is highly dependent on p53-mediated

apoptosis to override the survival signals acquired by cancer cells
(3, 4). CCRCC is one of most resistant tumors to conventional chemotherapy (1). Consistent with this view, 786-MOCK cells compared
with their wild-type VHL-reconstituted counterparts displayed considerable resistance to doxorubicin (Fig. 5B, left), a DNA-damaging
agent currently used in the clinic for the treatment of various tumors
such as breast and ovarian cancers (45, 46). If the chemoresistance of

CCRCC is indeed attributed to the impairment of p53 function via
HIF2α overexpression, one prediction is that the suppression of
HIF2α, or restoring the activity of p53 activity via nutlin-3 treatment,
would reverse the chemoresistance of 786-MOCK cells to doxorubicin-induced death. Suppression of HIF2α via HIF2α-specific shRNA
caused derepression of p53 expression via the inactivation of Hdm2
(see Fig. 3D), and as predicted, 786-RetroshHIF2α cells showed

HIF2α Promotes Chemoresistance of RCC

increased sensitivity to doxorubicin-induced cell death (Fig. 5B,
right). In accord, HIF2α knockdown enhanced p53 expression in
A498 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7) and led to enhanced sensitivity
to etoposide-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S8). 786-MOCK
and A498 cells treated with nutlin-3 increased the levels of p53 and
were dramatically sensitized to doxorubicin-induced, as well as etoposide-induced, cell death (Fig. 5C). Notably, such a treatment strategy has been adopted in preclinical trials against a variety of cancers
including leukemias, lung cancer, and neuroblastoma (47–49). These
results show that a death-inducing stimulus (i.e., DNA-damaging
agent or death receptor activation) is required in addition to the restoration of p53 activity, via nutlin-3 or HIF2α suppression, to promote the death of CCRCC cells.
Neocarzinostatin is a DNA-damaging radiomimetic drug known
to induce sequence-specific single-strand and double-strand
breaks, as well as phosphoinositide-3-kinase–dependent Hdm2
autoubiquitylation that results in Hdm2 destabilization and consequential accumulation of p53 (50, 51). One prediction is that, unlike conventional DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents
including cisplatin, Taxol, and 5-fluorouracil, which are unable to
destabilize Hdm2 or induce apoptosis in 786-MOCK cells (Supplementary Fig. S9), neocarzinostatin treatment alone would induce
786-MOCK cell death because neocarzinostatin induces both
DNA damage and p53 expression by destabilizing Hdm2. Notably,
similar low doses of cisplatin, Taxol, and 5-fluorouracil sufficiently
killed several other tumor cell lines, including H1299 lung carcinoma, SW480 colorectal adenocarcinoma, HCT-116 colorectal, and
SCC-9 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (data
not shown). As expected, 786-MOCK cells treated with neocarzinostatin rapidly decreased Hdm2 levels as early as 1 hour posttreatment and sustained this effect up to 24 hours (Fig. 5D, left;
Supplementary Fig. S10). Importantly, neocarzinostatin treatment
significantly increased p53 protein levels and PARP cleavage
(Fig. 5D, right, lane 3), whereas CH-11 treatment alone resulted
in an insignificant induction of PARP cleavage (Fig. 5D, right, lane 2;
see also Figs. 1, 2, and 5A). These results support the notion that
CCRCC cells could be rendered highly sensitive to chemotherapyinduced cell death by first restoring p53 function.

Discussion
Among urologic malignancies, CCRCC is the most lethal, with
more than one third of the patients succumbing to this disease.
Approximately one quarter of the patients present with metastatic
disease and one third of patients who have been treated by surgery
for clinically localized CCRCC eventually develop metastases.
Patients with metastatic CCRCC have a median survival of 13
months with a chemotherapy response rate of only 4% to 6% (1).
The majority of human cancers have compromised p53-induced
apoptotic pathways due to mutations in p53, which is tightly cor-

related with poor treatment response (5). CCRCC is arguably one
of the most chemoresistant tumors despite rarely harboring the
p53 gene mutations (6, 7). This paradox suggests that p53 may
be inactivated via nonmutational mechanisms. In support of this
notion, Gurova and colleagues showed that despite normal p53
status, p53-dependent transactivation in CCRCC cells is repressed
via unknown mechanisms (10). Galban and colleagues showed that
the reintroduction of VHL in CCRCC cells results in p53 accumulation, in part by enhanced binding of the RNA-stabilizing protein
HuR to the 3′-untranslated region of p53 mRNA (52). Recently,
Roe and colleagues reported that VHL stabilizes p53 via direct
protein-protein interaction (53). However, p53 expression level
and activity in VHL−/− CCRCC cells could be restored on shRNAmediated attenuation of HIF2α (see Fig. 3D), which argues that
VHL-dependent upregulation of p53 is indirect via HIF2α. Moreover, we did not observe any appreciable binding between VHL
and p53 (Supplementary Fig. S11).
Accumulation of HIF2α is regarded as a critical oncogenic event
in CCRCC (17). Here, we show that HIF2α induces Akt-mediated
phosphorylation of Hdm2(Ser166), which activates and promotes
the nuclear localization of Hdm2, resulting in the downregulation
of p53. In support, multiple patient-derived CCRCC tumor samples
almost invariably exhibited both strong nuclear phospho-Hdm2
(Ser166) and membranous expression of CAIX, a classic marker of
hypoxia and a reliable indicator of HIF activity. Consistent with increased nuclear phospho-Hdm2(Ser166) expression, the level of nuclear p53 was negligible in virtually all CCRCC tumor samples tested,
providing in vivo support for the link between aberrant HIF2 activity
and inactivation of p53 in kidney cancer. These results provide a
mechanistic explanation of why CCRCC cells are resistant to apoptosis triggered via Fas death receptor or DNA damage, and support
a rationale for combining conventional chemotherapy drugs, such
as doxorubicin or etoposide, with modalities that disarm Hdm2
such as nutlin-3 for the treatment of CCRCC.
