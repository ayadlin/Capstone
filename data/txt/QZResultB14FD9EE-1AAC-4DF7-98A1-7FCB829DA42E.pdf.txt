candidates. Importantly, given the significant challenge
of distinguishing between altered genes which are drivers
(i.e. genes that contribute to tumorigenesis) and those
that are merely passengers (i.e. genes that accumulate
alterations during tumor development but are not
biologically relevant), preliminary studies of the potential
functional significance of the candidate genes have been
conducted.
Recurrent focal deletions at 1p36, previously
reported in numerous cancers including GBM, were
found by Duncan et al. in their cohort of GBMs and
validated using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) project. Two distinct minimal deleted regions
were identified, with the most commonly-deleted region
containing a single gene, ERRFI1. ERRFI1 expression
was also found to be downregulated in ~34% of GBM
samples analyzed, and functional studies of a cell line
with a homozygous deletion of ERRFI1 revealed impaired
wound-healing and a lower rate of trans-well migration
after transfection with a vector containing ERRFI1,
suggesting ERRFI1 as a potential tumor suppressor gene
in GBMs. Similarly, focal gains at 4p16, most commonly
involving TACC3, and overexpression of TACC3 were
found in tumor samples, raising the possibility of TACC3
as a potential GBM oncogene.
Both of these genes are biologically-plausible as
GBM-related candidates. ERRFI1 acts as a negative
regulator of EGFR and the ERbB family, while
dysregulation of TACC (transforming acidic coiled
coil) genes, components of the centrosome, has been
implicated in cancer development. Significant work
remains, however, in order to confirm the relevance of
these genes for the pathogenesis of GBM and identify
them as potential targets of molecular therapeutics. In
particular, additional functional data firmly establishing
the genes as “drivers” and demonstrating their specific
biological role in GBM development are required. In
addition, clarification of how these genomic data fit in
with the evolving picture of the molecular classification of

Survival rates for patients with glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM), the most common malignant brain
tumor, remain dismal despite decades of basic and clinical
research. New treatment strategies are desperately needed.
Consequently, the high-throughput genomic technologies
developed to facilitate examination of cancer genomes
have recently been focused on GBM, with goals of
identifying novel molecular targets and developing a
clinically-relevant biological classification of this deadly
cancer.
These genomic analyses have provided an
unprecedented view of the complex genetic landscape
of GBM, confirming the central role of both wellestablished and previously-unsuspected genes in the
development of these tumors [1,2]. In addition, despite
the plethora of genes found to be altered in GBMs, these
data have allowed a semblance of order to be applied to
these tumors through the identification of a small number
of core pathways critical to GBM pathogenesis and the
elucidation of discrete molecular subgroups of GBM [3].
The list of biologically-relevant GBM genes remains
incomplete, however, due in large part to the logistical
challenge of establishing the functional significance
of the numerous genes found to be infrequently altered
(between 1 and 5%) in these cancers.
The detection of focal regions of recurrent copy
number gain or loss (amplifications or homozygous
deletions) can be a useful tool for the identification of
candidate cancer genes. Using such a high-resolution
genomic approach, Duncan et al. have identified two
genes as potentially relevant to the emerging picture of
the GBM genome, ERRFI1 (located at chr1p36) and
TACC3 (located at chr4p16) [4]. Genomic alterations
in these two regions have been reported in a number of
human cancers, but the specific target genes of these
copy number alterations are not known. The Digital
Karotyping and SNP array data provided by Duncan et
al. have provided initial evidence for two reasonable

GBM will be illuminating: for example, are alterations of
ERRFI1 specifically identified in the subgroup of GBMs
with downstream evidence of EGFR activation that lack
EGFR amplification or mutation [3]? Further research
building on the foundation of this intriguing genomic data
will surely add to our evolving picture of the glioblastoma
genome. Hopefully it will also contribute to the improved
care of our patients with these deadly cancers.
