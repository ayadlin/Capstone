ABSTRACT
Paclitaxel (PTX) is a chemotherapeutic agent that is used to treat a variety of
cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the emergence of
drug resistance limits the utility of PTX. This study determined the signaling pathway
that contributes to PTX resistance. We first established PTX resistant cell lines
(H460/R and 226B/R) using a dose-escalating maintenance of PTX. We found that
p38 MAPK and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were constitutively activated
in these cell lines. The inhibition of p38 MAPK activity by SB203580 treatment or
the transfection of dominant-negative p38 MAPK sensitized both cell lines to PTX
treatment. Erlotinib, an EGFR inhibitor, also increased PTX-induced apoptosis in PTX
resistant cells, which suggests a role for p38 MAPK and EGFR in the development of
PTX resistance. We demonstrated that p38 MAPK enhanced EGFR expression via the
induction of the rapid degradation of mouse double-minute 2 homolog (MDM2)
and the consequent stabilization of p53, a transcription factor of EGFR. These
results suggest for the first time that the p38 MAPK/p53/EGFR axis is crucial for
the facilitation of PTX resistance in NSCLCs. We also propose a mechanism for
the role of the tumor-suppressor p53 in drug resistance. These results provide a
foundation for the future development of potential therapeutic strategies to regulate
the p38 MAPK/p53/EGFR pathway for the treatment of lung cancer patients with
PTX resistance.

the mitotic checkpoint [10], a hypothesis that p53 is an
important determinant of cellular sensitivity to PTX
has been suggested. For example, the activation of p53
promotes apoptosis in PTX resistant cancer cells, and
the loss of functional p53 facilitates acquired resistance
to PTX [11,12]. In contrast, other researchers have
demonstrated that the loss of p53 function sensitizes
murine fibroblasts and cancer cells to PTX [13,14], which
leaves the controversial role of p53 in PTX resistance.
These studies only focused on primary PTX resistance,
Therefore, the role of p53 in acquired PTX resistance is
largely unknown.
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)

activated by a wide range of environmental stresses. It
is most frequently associated with a tumor-suppressor
function because it negatively regulates cell survival

INTRODUCTION
Paclitaxel (PTX) is a tubulin-disrupting agent that
remains a first line chemotherapy in the management
of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [1].
However, the development of intrinsic or acquired
resistance limits the utility of PTX [2,3]. Therefore,
investigations of the underlying mechanisms are needed
to devise novel strategies to overcome chemoresistance.
Various mechanisms, including the overexpression
of drug efflux pumps [4,5], mutations in TUBB [6,7],
and aberrations in the molecular pathways of cell cycle
control [8], confer PTX resistance. PTX sensitivity is
dependent on molecules related to functional spindle
assembly checkpoints [9]. p53 is a tumor suppressor
protein that leads to cell growth arrest or apoptosis in
response to DNA damage. As p53 is also implicated in

and proliferation [15]. PTX also induces apoptosis
through a p38 MAPK-mediated pathway [16,17]. In
contrast, the role of p38 MAPK as a contributor to drug
resistance was recently suggested. The inhibition of
p38 MAPK diminished chemoresistance against drugs
such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and vincristine
by abrogation  of the activity or expression of the
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) protein [18–20]. A constitutive
increase in phosphorylated p38 MAPK was found in
drug-resistant cells. Notably, p38 MAPK also conferred
PTX resistance to ovarian cancer cells, but the precise
molecular mechanism has not been determined [12,21].
These conflicting roles of p38 MAPK in PTX resistance
suggest that the different downstream effectors that lead
to the dual functions of p38 MAPK should be further
elucidated.
Previous studies have demonstrated the mechanism
of regulation of p53 stability. The most recognized player
for mediating p53 protein degradation is mouse doubleminute 2 homolog (MDM2). MDM2 serves as a typical E3
ubiquitin ligase of p53 and is also one of p53 target genes
[22]. p38 MAPK-induced phosphorylation of p53 leads
to its disassociation from MDM2 and consequent evasion
of ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation [23]. p38 MAPK is
also known to regulate MDM2 expression by unknown
mechanism, suggesting the critical role of p38 MAPK in
the modulation of MDM2 and p53 expression in a posttranslational manner [24–27]. Although previous reports
have demonstrated that MDM2 overexpression confers
drug resistance through suppression of p53-mediated
apoptosis [28,29], its function as a negative regulator of
chemoresistance remains unexplored.
This study determined the signaling molecules that
contributed to PTX resistance. We found that p38 MAPK
played a critical role in PTX resistance via the p53mediated regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) expression. We propose a novel mechanism for
p38 MAPK modulation of the EGFR pathway and the final
facilitation of PTX resistance based on these observations.
We also provide an explanation for the role of the tumor
suppressor p53 in PTX resistance.

(Figure 1A). We performed trypan blue exclusion
and anchorage-dependent colony formation assays to
determine whether PTX resistance was well established
in these cell lines. The results demonstrated that the
survival rates and colony forming ability of PTX resistant
cells were significantly higher than those of the parental
cells following PTX treatment (P < 0.001) (Figure 1,
B and C). We conducted cell cycle analyses using flow
cytometry to verify whether the resistant phenotypes were
associated with reduced apoptosis. H460 and H226B cells
exhibited a marked increase in sub-G1 phase populations
compared with H460/R and 226B/R cells treated with
PTX (P < 0.001) (Figure 1D). Similar results were
obtained when apoptosis was monitored using DAPI
staining. Apoptotic cells, identified by highly condensed
and fragmented nuclear DNA, were increased in the
parental cells following PTX treatment. In contrast, PTXtreated resistant cells exhibited a homogeneous staining
of intact nuclei, similar to that of untreated control cells
(Figure 1E). Taken together, these results demonstrated
that H460/R and 226B/R cells acquired a PTX resistant
phenotype.

Identification of up-regulated signaling pathways
in PTX resistant cells
We investigated constitutively activated signaling
pathways in PTX resistant cells to identify the mechanisms
that conferred PTX resistance. We focused on receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including IGFR and EGFR, and
their downstream signaling mediators, including Ras/Raf/
MAPK and PI3K/AKT. These molecules are aberrantly
activated due to overexpression or mutation in various
human cancers, and they play crucial roles in cancer cell
proliferation, anti-apoptotic behavior, and anticancer
drug resistance [30–35]. Among these candidates, EGFR,
AKT, JNK and p38 MAPK exhibited higher activities
in H460/R cells compared with H460 cells (P < 0.001).
Especially, EGFR and p38 MAPK were commonly
activated in H226B/R and H460/R cells compared with
their respective parental cells (Figure 2A). These results
suggest that p38 MAPK and EGFR play an important role
in PTX resistance.
MAPK is generally activated by signals that are
transmitted by receptors located in the cell membrane.
Therefore, we hypothesized that EGFR would be upstream
of p38 MAPK. However, we found that the inhibition of
EGFR by erlotinib hardly affected phosphorylated p38
(p-p38) levels, in contrast to our hypothesis (Figure 2B).
Rather, an inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB203580, reduced
the expression of phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR) and
total EGFR (t-EGFR) (Figure 2C). The mRNA expression
of EGFR also decreased following SB203580 treatment,
which suggests that the p38 MAPK-mediated regulation
of EGFR expression occurs at the transcriptional level
(Figure 2D).

RESULTS
Establishment of PTX resistant lung cancer
cell lines
We treated H460 and 226B cells with 4 nM PTX,
as a starting concentration, to generate PTX resistant
sublines. The medium was changed to fresh medium that
contained PTX every 3 days until the cells were confluent
on the plates. The cells were incubated with gradually
increasing PTX concentrations. This cycle was repeated
for 6 months until the stable PTX resistant sublines,
referred to as H460/R and H226B/R, were established

We assessed the transcription level of EGFR in
PTX resistant cells. Real-time PCR and RT-PCR analyses
revealed elevated EGFR mRNA levels in H460/R and
H226B/R cells compared with their corresponding
parental cells (P < 0.001) (Figure 2E). Transfection with
a dominant-negative mutant of p38 MAPK (p38 DN)

reversed the up-regulation of EGFR mRNA and EGFR
protein levels in PTX resistant cells (Figure 2F), which
suggests that p38 MAPK functions upstream of EGFR.
Collectively, these observations indicated that activation
of the p38 MAPK/EGFR axis is associated with PTX
resistance.

Association of p38 MAPK with PTX resistance

we examined whether erlotinib treatment sensitizes
MKK6EE-overexpressing cells to PTX. The results
clearly showed that the combined treatment of PTX
with erlotinib markedly reduced the colony formation in
MKK6EE cells compared with erlotinib single treatment
(P < 0.001) (Figure 4E). These observations suggest that
p38 MAPK confers PTX resistance through modulation
of the EGFR pathway.
To investigate whether p38 MAPK regulates EGFR
pathway in parental cells as well, we examined whether
blockade of p38 MAPK can inhibit the expression
of p-EGFR and t-EGFR in H460 and H226B cells.
As shown in Supplementary Figure 1A, SB203580
slightly reduced (H460 cells) or even increased (H226B
cells) p-EGFR expression without alteration of total
EGFR (t-EGFR) expression levels. In addition, neither
SB203580 nor erlotinib enhanced the effect of PTX in
these naïve cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1, B and
C). These results suggest that regulation of EGFR by p38
MAPK suppression sensitizes only NSCLC cells carrying
acquired PTX resistance, but not parental cells, to the
drug treatment.
Next, we assessed whether inhibition of AKT or
JNK could sensitize H460/R cells to PTX treatment,
because they were up-regulated in H460/R cells
compared with H460 cells (P < 0.001) (Figure 2A). We
observed that neither LY294002, a PI3K/Akt inhibitor,
nor SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, sensitized H460/R cells
to PTX treatment (Supplementary Figure 2, A and B).
These results clearly suggest that activation of AKT
and JNK in H460/R cells is not associated with PTX
resistance.
As previous reports showed that p38 MAPK
is responsible for drug resistance through regulation
of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene [18,19], we
examined whether p38 MAPK-mediated development of
PTX resistance is also related with up-regulation of drug
efflux pumps. First, we investigated whether MDR genes
are up-regulated in PTX resistant cells. We particularly
focused on MDR1/ABCB1 and ABCB4 genes according
to the previous report demonstrating increase in these two
genes in the most in H460-PTX resistant cells compared
with parental cells [36]. Through real-time quantitative
reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), we observed
that both ABCB1 and ABCB4 increased in H460/R and
H226B/R cells compared with their respective parental
cells (P < 0.001) (Supplementary Figure 3, A and B).
These results are in agreement with the previous reports
which indicated the overexpression of drug efflux pumps
as a mechanism of PTX resistance [4,5]. To investigate
whether these genes are regulated by p38 MAPK as
reported in the earlier studies [18,19], we treated the PTX
resistant cells with SB203580 and examined the changes
in mRNA expression of ABCB1 and ABCB4 using qRTPCR. Contrary to the previous reports, our results showed
that ABCB1 gene was even increased by SB203580

We verified whether p38 MAPK activity was
responsible for PTX resistance. SB203580 treatment
sensitized H460/R and H226B/R cells to PTX, as shown
in the MTT (Figure 3A) and soft agar colony-forming
(Figure 3B) assays. Co-treatment with SB203580 and
PTX also enhanced apoptosis, as evaluated by increase
of Annexin V-positive populations and up-regulation
of cleaved-PARP and cleaved-caspase-3 expressions,
compared with single treatment with PTX (Figure 3,
C and D). We used a genetic approach by introducing
p38 DN into H460/R cells to exclude the effects of offtarget activity of SB203580. Cells expressing p38 DN
exhibited more significant decreases in cell viability
and colony-forming ability compared with control
cells following treatment with PTX (50 nM; P < 0.001)
(Figure 3, E and F). PTX treatment also markedly
increased the protein levels of cleaved PARP and
cleaved caspase-3 compared with empty vector (EV)transfected cells (Figure 3G). These results demonstrate
that p38 MAPK plays a critical role in the generation of
PTX resistance.
A constitutively active mutant of MAP kinase kinase
6 (MKK6EE), which directly phosphorylates p38 MAPK,
was introduced in H460 parental cells to clarify whether
p38 MAPK activity by itself was sufficient to create PTX
resistance. We observed that transfection with MKK6EE
rescued cell viability and colony-forming ability following
PTX treatment (Figure 3, H and I). PTX-induced
apoptosis, evaluated by cleaved PARP and cleaved
caspase-3 expressions, was also decreased by MKK6EE
transfection than mock transfection (Figure 3J), which
indicates that p38 MAPK can confer PTX resistance.

Effects of EGFR inhibition on PTX resistance
Our data indicate that EGFR is downstream of
p38 MAPK, and we postulated that targeting the EGFR
pathway would be an effective strategy to overcome
PTX resistance. Erlotinib treatment sensitized H460/R
and H226B/R cells to PTX treatment. The combined
treatment with PTX and erlotinib exhibited significant
decrease in the cell viability and colony-forming ability
than erlotinib single treatment in these two resistant
sublines (P < 0.001) (Figure 4A and 4B). In addition, we
observed that treatment with PTX alone did not cause
apoptotic cell death, whereas combinatorial treatment
with erlotinib markedly restored PTX-induced apoptosis,
as determined by increases in annexin V-positive cell
population (P < 0.001), in H460/R cells (Figure 4C).
The expression of cleaved-PARP and cleaved-caspase-3
was also increased by co-treatment with PTX and
erlotinib in PTX resistant cells (Figure 4D).

resistance is mediated by the EGFR signaling pathway,

Involvement of p53 in the p38 MAPK-mediated
regulation of EGFR expression

treatment in H460/R and H226B/R cells. The expression
of ABCB4 gene was not affected by SB203580 treatment
in H226B/R cells. Even though SB203580 treatment
reduced the expression of ABCB4 in H460/R cells, the
extent of fold increase in ABCB4 was quite low compared
with that of ABCB1, suggesting that their contribution to
PTX resistance would be marginal (Supplementary Figure
3, A and B). Collectively, these results suggest that p38
MAPK/p53-mediated PTX resistance is not related to the
regulation of MDR genes, highlighting our findings as an
additional novel mechanism of PTX resistance.

We investigated the transcription factors for EGFR
gene expression to determine the mechanisms of the p38
MAPK regulation of EGFR expression. We focused on
p53 as a target factor based on previous studies for the
following reasons: (i) wild-type p53 transcriptionally
regulates the EGFR gene via direct DNA binding [37–
39]; (ii) p38 MAPK enhances p53 protein stability
and transcriptional activity via the phosphorylation of

N-terminal residues [40,41]; (iii) co-overexpression of
p53 protein and EGFR correlated with poor prognosis
and advanced pathological stage in papillary thyroid
carcinomas and NSCLC [42,43] ; and (iv) the p38 MAPK/
p53/p21 signaling axis confers primary resistance to PTX
in prostate cancer cells [44]. We investigated whether
p53 mediated the p38 MAPK-induced EGFR expression.
We assessed the nuclear localization of p53 in H460/R
cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that nuclear
and cytosolic p53 expression was greater in H460/R cells
than in H460 cells (Figure 5A). To validate the role of
p53 in EGFR expression, we analyzed EGFR expression
in H460R and H226B/R cells, in which p53 expression
was knocked-down by siRNA against TP53. Silencing of
the TP53 gene decreased EGFR expression. One siRNA
(siTP53 #1), which failed to silence p53 expression, did
not influence EGFR expression (Figure 5B). Notably,
p53 protein levels were elevated, but TP53 mRNA levels
were slightly lower in H460/R cells than in H460 cells
(Figure 5C). As it is reported that p38 MAPK controls
the stability of p53 [23,40], we hypothesized that p38
MAPK would mediate p53 stabilization. We analyzed the
half-life of the p53 protein and found that the half-life
of p53 in H460/R cells was longer than in H460 cells
(Figure 5D). Next, we assessed MDM2 expression in
PTX resistant cells. MDM2 mRNA levels were greater
in H460/R cells than in H460 cells. However, MDM2
protein levels were greater in H460 cells than in H460/R
cells (Figure 5C). Moreover, the half-life of MDM2 in
H460/R cells was shorter than that in H460 cells (Figure
5D). MDM2 expression in H460/R cells was restored
following treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which indicates a ubiquitin-proteasomal pathwaymediated degradation of the MDM2 protein in H460/R
cells (Figure 5E). These findings suggested that p53
and MDM2 proteins are under the post-translational
regulation that occurs in H460/R cells.
We assessed whether p38 MAPK was involved
in the post-translational regulation of p53 and MDM2
proteins in H460/R cells. H460/R cells, in which p38
MAPK was inactivated by transfection with dominantnegative p38 MAPK (p38 DN), exhibited decreased
p53 protein and increased MDM2 protein levels and no
changes in their mRNA expression levels (Figure 5F).
The inactivation of p38 MAPK also decreased nuclear
and cytosolic p53 protein levels (Figure 5G). p38 MAPK
inactivation decreased p53 half-life but prolonged MDM2
half-life, which is consistent with our expectations (Figure
5H). In addition, MG-132 treatment thoroughly recovered
the reduction of p53 protein expression (Figure 5I).
These results indicated that the regulation of p53 stability
by p38 MAPK was dependent on the MDM2-mediated
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Application of the specific
inhibitor of p38 MAPK SB203580 suppressed p53
expression but induced a simultaneous up-regulation of
the MDM2 protein in H460/R and H226B/R cells (Figure
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

5J). Collectively, these data suggest that p38 MAPK
protects p53 from the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation
via induction of the rapid destruction of MDM2, which
ultimately leads to the up-regulation of its target genes,
including EGFR (summarized in Figure 6).

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrated novel insight
into the mechanism underlying acquired resistance to
PTX. We identified the p38 MAPK/p53/EGFR axis as a
pivotal signaling pathway that confers PTX resistance.
p38 MAPK functions as a tumor suppressor, and we
provided evidence that p38 MAPK contributed to
chemoresistance via regulation of the EGFR pathway in
a p53-dependent mechanism. One of the most significant
advancements of this study is that the novel bidirectional
modulation of MDM2 and p53 mediated by p38 MAPK
is involved in the development of PTX resistance. We
suggest that cells exposed to continuous stress utilize
p38 MAPK and p53 to repair the accumulated cellular
damage.
The role of the EGFR family in the emergence of PTX
resistance was suggested in a series of studies: (i) gefitinib
and lapatinib reversed PTX resistance in prostate, breast,
and ovarian cancer cells via the direct inhibition of P-gp
and drug efflux [45–47]; (ii) the expression of constitutively
active EGFR and HER2 induces PTX resistance via
increases in class IVa and IVb β-tubulin [48]; (iii) the
overexpression of ErbB2 inhibits PTX-induced apoptosis
via p21-dependent mechanisms [49,50]; and (iv) ErbB3
contributes to PTX resistance via PI3K/Akt-mediated upregulation of survivin [51]. Strategies to block the EGFR
family enhanced the response to PTX in clinical trials. For
example, trastuzumab significantly improved the response
of breast cancer patients to PTX [52]. Our results also
demonstrated that the EGFR pathway was activated in
NSCLC cells sublines with acquired PTX resistance and that
the PTX resistance was dramatically reduced when erlotinib
was treated in combination with PTX. On the contrary,
PTX plus erlotinib combination exhibited no synergy
in parental cells. A phase III trial also demonstrated that
combination therapy of gefitinib and PTX in chemotherapynaïve patients with advanced NSCLC revealed no clinical
benefit compared with standard chemotherapy alone [53].
These results highlight the importance of EGFR in the
development of PTX resistance and suggest that EGFR
expression is a critical issue to determine the sensitivity to
PTX-based therapy.
In the current study, we found that the
activation of p38 MAPK was related with the EGFR
expression. The role of p38 MAPK in resistance to
various chemotherapeutic drugs including PTX has
been suggested in several studies [12,18–21]. The
present study demonstrated the following results: 1)
p38 MAPK activation and transcriptional increases

in EGFR expression in PTX resistant cells; 2)
reduced EGFR transcription following treatment
with SB203580 or transfection with p38 DN; and 3)
significant attenuation of MKK6EE-induced PTX
resistance by erlotinib treatment. These results clearly
indicate that p38 MAPK induced PTX resistance
via a transcriptional increase in EGFR expression.
Several studies demonstrated that stress-induced
activation of p38 MAPK enhances the cytotoxic effect
of chemotherapy by transphosphorylation of EGFR at
multiple serine and threonine residues and subsequent
receptor internalization [54]. In contrast, our results
demonstrated that p38 MAPK induced PTX resistance
by phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine 1068, an
autophosphorylation site. Mathay et al. reported that
oxidative stress-induced p38 MAPK activation increased

heparin-binding (HB)-EGF expression [55]. Ectodomain
shedding of EGFR ligands including transforming
growth factor-alpha (TGF-α) and pro-HB-EGF following
p38 MAPK activation was also reported [56,57]. These
ligands resulted in subsequent EGFR activation and
evasion of chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis in
tumor cells [57]. Thus, the modulation of EGFR ligand
bioavailability is another possible mechanism through
which p38 MAPK mediates EGFR pathway activation.
Taken together, these findings suggest the importance
of the p38 MAPK/EGFR pathway in chemotherapy
tolerance and the development of drug resistance.
We elucidated the mechanisms underlying the
p38 MAPK-mediated transcriptional increase in EGFR
expression and found that p53 is the transcription
factor for EGFR expression. Conflicting roles of p53

A. The nuclear translocation of p53 was examined using nuclear/cytosol extraction in H460 and H460/R cells. PARP and β-tubulin were used
as markers of nuclear and cytosolic fractions, respectively. B. H460/R and H226B/R cells were transfected with scrambled (SC) or TP53
siRNAs (#1 or #2). At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were collected and assessed for western blot analysis to investigate the influence of p53
on the expression of EGFR. C. The basal expression level of p53 and MDM2 in H460 and H460/R cells was investigated using western blot
(left) and RT-PCR (right) analyses. D. Cycloheximide (CHX) was added to the medium to stop protein translation. Cells were taken at the
indicated time-points, and the protein turnover of p53 and MDM2 was determined using western blot analysis. The relative abundance of p53
and MDM2 compared with the untreated controls was calculated based on band intensity using ImageJ software. E. The cells were treated with
MG-132 (MG; 10 µM) for 4 h, and the protein levels of p53 and MDM2 were determined using western blot analysis. F-I. H460/R cells were
stably transfected with empty (EV) or p38 DN expression vectors. F. The protein level (left) and mRNA expression (right) of p53 and MDM2,
G. the nuclear localization of p53, H. the protein turnover of p53 and MDM2 following CHX treatment, and I. the recovery of the amount of
p53 and MDM2 protein following MG-132 treatment were assessed. J. H460/R and H226B/R cells were treated with SB203580 (SB; 50 µM)
in a time-dependent manner. The expression changes in p53 and MDM2 were detected using western blot analysis.

in PTX resistance were suggested in several studies.
Most studies describe p53 as a mediator of PTXinduced apoptosis. However, some research suggests
that the function of p53 in response to PTX is cell
type-dependent. Notably, p38 MAPK and p53 were upregulated in response to cellular damage, and cells that
survived the prolonged treatment with PTX developed
PTX resistance via the activation of stress-dependent
pathways, including p38 MAPK and p53, to repair the
accumulated cellular damage. Several studies suggested

a mechanism for the p38 MAPK-based regulation of
p53 expression. The most recognized mechanism is p38
MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of p53 at N-terminal
serine residues, which results in disassociation from
MDM2 and consequent evasion of MDM2-mediated
ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation [23]. p38 MAPK is
also associated with growth arrest and DNA damageinducible 45α (GADD45α) proteins, and it promotes
their interaction with p53, which further increases
p53 stability [41,58]. We found a rapid degradation of

Figure 6: A schematic model of the p38 MAPK/p53/EGFR pathway that leads to PTX resistance. Schematic diagram

for the proposed model of the PTX resistance in NSCLC cells. Continuous exposure of cancer cells to PTX activates a stress-induced
kinase p38 MAPK to develop PTX resistance. In chemo-naïve cells, p53 is generally degraded by its E3 ligase, MDM2, conferring the
high sensitivity to PTX. However, the constitutively activated p38 MAPK in PTX-resistant cells induces the rapid degradation of MDM2
through the classical ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the consequent stabilization of p53. The stabilized p53 translocates to the nucleus
and regulates the expression of its target genes, including EGFR, which finally leads to the generation of acquired resistance to PTX.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

MDM2 and enhanced p53 stability in PTX resistant
cells. This phenomenon was completely reversed by
p38 MAPK inhibition, which suggests that p38 MAPK
controlled the stability of MDM2 and p53 (Figure 5).
Several studies reported the p38 MAPK-mediated
regulation of MDM2 [24–27], but most of these studies
provided no explanation of the underlying mechanism.
Notably, Elias et al. reported that p38 MAPK markedly
decreased steady-state levels of MDM2 through an
indirect mechanism [27]. It seems that prolonged cellular
stress induced by PTX treatment activates p38 MAPK
stress kinase, which regulates p53 and MDM2. Lu et al.
also demonstrated that docetaxel treatment reduced
MDM2 expression and increased p53 stability, which is
consistent with our results [44].
The current study did not address how p38 MAPK
mediates the degradation of MDM2. It is likely that p38
MAPK directly phosphorylates MDM2, which leads
to its degradation through the proteasome pathway.
Alternatively, p38 MAPK may interact with other
molecules to regulate MDM2 stability. DNA-dependent
protein kinase (DNA-PK), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated
(ATM) kinase, AKT, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
are implicated in MDM2 phosphorylation which induces
autoubiquitination of MDM2 [26]. Notably, ATM kinase
is involved in the cellular response to genotoxic stress,
and it exhibits reciprocal effects on MDM2 and p53 like
p38 MAPK [26]. These results suggest that p38 MAPK
might crosstalk with these molecules. We did not assess
whether p38 MAPK directly phosphorylates p53 in
PTX resistant cells, but our findings suggest that the p38
MAPK-mediated degradation of MDM2 plays a critical
role in p53 stabilization.
In conclusion, we propose a paradoxical
scenario in which the tumor-suppressor p53 confers
PTX resistance. We suggest that the prolonged stress
associated with PTX treatment stimulates the p38
MAPK/p53 network and induces EGFR transcription,
which activates the EGFR pathway and PTX resistance
in NSCLC. Our results also demonstrated significantly
enhanced antitumor activities by co-treatment with
SB203580 and PTX in NSCLC cells with acquired
PTX resistance. These results suggest that targeting p38
MAPK, p53, or EGFR could be a therapeutic strategy to
overcome PTX resistance. In support of our suggestion,
a recent clinical trial demonstrates that the combinatorial
treatment with an EGFR inhibitor and PTX improves
the response of breast cancer patients to PTX [52].
In addition, development of various p38 MAPK
inhibitors as anticancer therapeutics is ongoing [59],
and a recent study demonstrates that a p38α inhibitor
BIRB 796 enhances antitumor effects of anticancer
therapies for multiple myeloma such as bortezomib
and dexamethasone [60]. Further studies are warranted
to evaluate the effectiveness of these combinatorial
strategies in additional preclinical and clinical settings.

Cell culture
H460 cells were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA).
H226B cells were kindly provided by Jack A. Roth (MD
Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA). Cells were
grown at 37°C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and antibiotics (all from WelGENE). Cells were
sub-cultured every 2-3 days at approximately 80–90%
confluency.

Trypan blue exclusion assay
Cells were seeded in 12-well plastic culture dishes at
a density of 1×104 cells per well and incubated overnight.
The medium was then replaced with complete media
containing different concentrations of PTX. After 3 days,
cells were collected and diluted 1:1 using a 0.4% trypan
blue solution. As non-viable cells are stained as blue color,
the number of viable cells was evaluated by counting
unstained cells using a hemocytometer.

with or without erlotinib or SB203580 and incubated for 3
days. The MTT solution (final 0.4 mg/ml) was added and
incubated for 3 h. The media were aspirated and 100 μl of
DMSO were added to each well to dissolve the formazan
product. After shaking for 30 min, the absorbance was
measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader.

For Annexin V/PI double staining, cells were seeded
onto 6-well plate at a density of 1.5×105 cells per well.
Then cells were challenged with PTX and erlotinib or
SB203580 for 72 h. Apoptotic cells were quantitatively
identified with the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection
Kit I (BD Biosciences PharMingen, San Diego, CA,
USA), following protocols provided by the manufacturer.

Anchorage-dependent and -independent colony
formation assay

Nuclear staining with DAPI
3×105 cells were seeded onto cover glass in 6-well
plate and treated with PTX the next day. After 48 h, cells
were harvested, washed once with PBS, and then fixed with
3.7% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at room
temperature. The fixed cells were washed three times with
PBS, and stained with DAPI solution (2.5 μg/ml) for 20 min
at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS
and mounted with a mounting solution (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA). The morphologic changes in the
nucleus were analyzed by Nuance fluorescence microscope
(Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA).

The anchorage-dependent colony formation assay
was conducted by seeding cells onto 12-well plates at a
low density (2×102 cells per well). Cells were treated with
different concentrations of PTX with or without erlotinib
and incubated for 10-14 days at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2 until visable colonies were
formed. During the period, the medium was changed every
3 days. The colonies were fixed with 100% methanol for
5 min and stained with hematoxylin for 30 min at room
temperature. After washing several times with distilled
water (DW), the number of visable colonies was counted.
For the anchorage-independent colony formation
assay, 4% low-melting agarose (Lonza, Rockland,
ME) solution was prepared in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) as a stock solution. 1 ml of 1% bottom
agar solution was added to each well in a 24-well cell
culture plate and left to solidify at room temperature.
Then 0.5-1×103 cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of top
agar solution (final 0.4%) and plated. The plate was
kept at room temperature until the top agar solidified
and then incubated for 10-14 days in the growth
medium containing different concentrations of PTX
with or without erlotinib or SB203580. The medium was
changed every 3 days during this period. The colonies
were stained with the MTT solution (final 0.5 mg/ml) for
2 h at 37°C. After the medium containing MTT solution
was changed with PBS, the colonies were photographed,
and the number of visable colonies was counted.

Western blotting analysis
To prepare whole cell lysate, cells were
lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer [1% NP-40, 0.25%
sodium  deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl,
50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10%
Glycerol] including a complete protease inhibitor cocktail
tablet (Roche diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and
phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM Na3VO4, 100 mM NaF, and
10 mM NaPP). After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4°C
for 30 min, the supernatants were collected and protein
concentration was determined using a biochinconinic
acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology,
Rockford, IL, USA) as described in the manufacturer’s
protocol. Equivalent amounts of protein were resolved by
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–polyacrylamide gels and
transferred to a polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membrane.
After the membrane was blocked with 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA, GenDEPOT, Barker, TX, USA)
in TBST [Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1%
Tween 20] for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane
was incubated with primary antibody at the appropriate
dilution in 3% BSA overnight at 4°C. The membrane was
then washed multiple times with TBST and incubated
with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The
protein–antibody complexes were detected by SuperSignal
West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo
Scientific Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s recommended protocol.

Flow cytometry analysis
For measurement of cell population in the sub-G1
phase, cells were seeded in 60-mm culture dish at a density
of 5×105 cells per dish. After overnight incubation, cells
were treated with different concentrations of PTX for 72 h.
Adherent and floating cells were collected, washed twice
with PBS, and fixed with cold 80% ethanol for more than 1
h at 4°C. After centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 3 min, cells
were resuspended in 500 μl of PI/PBS staining solution
which contains 450 μl of PBS, 50 μl of 0.5 mg/ml PI, and
1.5 μl of 10 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A (Sigma) to stain
DNA, and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
Flow cytometric analyses were performed using a flow
cytometer (FACS Caliber, Becton Dickinson), and the
relative DNA content in each phase of the cell cycle was
determined by CellQuest software. The population in the
sub-G1 phase was determined as apoptotic cells.
