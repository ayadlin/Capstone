ABSTRACT
KRAS is the most commonly mutated oncogene, frequently associated with some
of the deadliest forms of cancer. However, the need for potent and specific KRAS
inhibitors remains unmet. Here, we evaluated the effects of selected cytotoxic agents
on oncogenic KRAS signaling and drug response. The data provided new insights into
the functional interaction between the KRAS and MYC pathways and revealed key
differences between WT and mutant KRAS expressing cells. Systematic investigation
of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines revealed that KRAS mutation can paradoxically
increase the sensitivity of cells to cytotoxic agents. We identify MYC as a key regulator
of the cellular stress responses and tumor cell viability as MYC expression was
suppressed in drug-sensitive but not resistant cells. Furthermore, this suppression
was driven by hyperactive KRAS/MAPK signaling. Our findings support a direct link
between MYC and cancer cell viability, and raise the possibility that inactivation of
MYC may be an effective therapeutic strategy for KRAS mutant tumors across various
cancer types.

[2, 3]. Mutations in other genes, such as ERBB2, MET,
BRAF, MAP2K1 and NF1, are almost always mutually
exclusive with KRAS or PIKC3A mutations; however,
the frequencies of these mutations are low. To put these
data in context, mutations that result in increased RAS
or PI3K activity are present in ~50% of NSCLCs. From
a therapeutic standpoint, such tumors are more likely to
be amenable to targeted therapies than tumors with rare
combinations of mutations but no identifiable oncogene. In
turn, targeted therapies are expected to be more effective
than chemotherapy and radiation, the mainstays of cancer
treatment today. Recent discoveries have unveiled an
impressive list of the RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT
pathway inhibitors, offering a new treatment paradigm for
cancer patients. However, despite the initial promise, most
of the responses to these pathway inhibitors have been
partial and short lived.
The presence of oncogenic KRAS mutations has
become widely accepted as a negative predictor for
treatment outcome. Resistance and off target toxicity are
major challenges in the development of clinically suitable
drugs [4]. Cancer cells frequently respond to standard

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide, accounting for ~1.6 million deaths
annually. Lung cancers are generally divided into two
main categories: small cell carcinoma and non-small cell
carcinoma (NSCLC). The NSCLCs account for nearly
80% of all lung cancers and can be subdivided into
adenocarcinoma (ADC; 50% of all cases), squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC; 40%) and large cell carcinoma (10%).
Recent advances in whole genome sequencing have
further delineated NSCLCs as a group of distinct diseases
with genetic and cellular heterogeneity. It is now evident
that NSCLCs harbor large numbers (>200) of mutations,
although as few as three driver gene mutations may be
sufficient for the appearance of terminal cancer [1]. Most
lung cancers either lack an identifiable oncogene, or
tend to affect genes that can be clustered into a smaller
number of signaling pathways and processes. Among
these, mutations in KRAS (>30%), EGFR (~15%) and
ALK (~5%) prevail in lung ADCs, whereas mutations
affecting the PI3K pathway (~50%) prevail in lung SCCs

treatments by readjustment of signaling networks or
through acquisition of bidirectional conversions between
KRAS-dependent (drug-sensitive) and independent
(drug-resistant) cell states [4, 5]. There is demand for
novel approaches to identify mechanisms responsible
for KRAS-mediated drug resistance and determine
which signaling nodes are suitable for treatment, as
well as which targets to select within these nodes.
Arguably, the role of the proto-oncogene MYC in drug
resistance is one of the biggest unanswered questions
concerning KRAS-driven cancers. Current models posit
that MYC is essential for KRAS-driven cancer [6]; RAS
activation stabilizes MYC [7]; in turn, MYC renders
cells vulnerable to DNA damage and apoptosis [8].
Clearly, these models appear to contradict one another.
Perhaps the most obvious contradiction is that the degree
and duration of oncogenic RAS activation would have
profound effects on MYC protein accumulation and
thus enhance rather than decrease tumor sensitivity to
chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Also, while most early
studies utilized the activated form of HRAS (generally
referred to as RAS), each RAS isoform (HRAS, KRAS
and NRAS) has a distinct biological function, and KRAS
mutations are much more common in human cancers
than NRAS and HRAS mutations.
To resolve these apparent contradictions, we
evaluated the effects of selected cytotoxic agents on
the inhibition of oncogenic KRAS signaling and drug
response. Systematic investigation of NSCLC cell
lines revealed that KRAS mutation can paradoxically
increase the sensitivity of cells to cytotoxic agents.
We reveal functional separation between resistance
mechanisms and KRAS mutation status and
demonstrate that drug-induced cytotoxicity of KRAS
mutant cancer cells is contingent on MYC inhibition.
MYC is suppressed in drug-sensitive cells, and this
suppression is mediated by increased and prolonged
activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. Our results
provide new insight into the complex nature of KRASMYC interactions, the majority of which do not fall into
easily recognizable within-pathway relationships. This
more comprehensive understanding of KRAS-MYC
relationships will inevitably be informative for the goal
of manipulating KRAS signal activity for therapeutic
purposes.

[9]. The basis of this remains unclear but is thought to
be influenced by the mutational complexity of tumors.
To identify the particular vulnerabilities of KRAS mutant
cancer cells, we have developed a panel of primary lung
epithelial cells that carry a conditional mutant allele of
the KRAS gene (KRAS G12D) on a p53-null genetic
background. These cells can be clonally expanded in
culture and produce tumors in mice, consistent with the
role of KRAS in lung carcinogenesis [10]. As signaling
through the RAS/MAPK and PI3K pathways is required to
sustain KRAS-induced lung tumorigenesis [11], we sought
to assess the efficacy of combined targeting of these
pathways in our cell system. To that end, we screened our
KRAS G12D cell lines for growth inhibition and induction
of cell death after exposure to chemical inhibitors of MEK
(PD0325901 and GSK1120212), PI3K (BEZ235 and
GDC0941) and IGF1R (OSI-906 and GSK1904529A).
Of these, Trametinib (GSK1120212) is FDA-approved for
melanoma; BEZ235 is a dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitor,
while GDC0941 is an inhibitor of class I PI3K (http://
www.cancer.gov). Recent data suggest that insulin-like
growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) exerts dominant control
over PI3K signaling in human KRAS mutant cancers
[12, 13]. All these MEK/PI3K inhibitor combinations
exhibited marked downregulation of MAPK and PI3K
signaling, as assessed by the levels of activated ERK
and AKT (Figure 1A). However, there was no significant
cytotoxicity against tumor cells (Supplementary Figure
1A, B). We and others have recently reported that drugtolerant cells can be ablated via co-targeting the MAPK
and PI3K pathways and histone deacetylase (HDAC)
inhibition [14, 15]. We also demonstrated that targeting
MEK and PI3K in combination with HDACs reduces the
self-renewal of PDAC cells harboring the mutant KRAS
allele (KRAS G12D) and blocks cancer metastasis in vivo
[15]. Applying this treatment regimen to the KRAS G12D
lung cancer cell lines likewise resulted in acute sensitivity
to MEK/PI3K/HDAC inhibitor combination. The strongest
cytotoxic effects were obtained with GSK1120212,
BEZ235 and trichostatin A (TSA), a classical inhibitor of
class I and II HDACs (Figure 1B). Short-term use of the
BEZ/GSK/TSA drug combination (hereafter referred to
as BGT) caused growth inhibition and cell death of up
to 90% of KRAS mutant cancer cells (Supplementary
Figure 1A, 1B). At low concentrations (below 0.2μM),
these drugs were relatively non-toxic to normal lung cells
(Supplementary Figure 1C). Thus, targeting of KRAS by
combing MEK, PI3K inhibitors and TSA overcomes drug
resistance in lung cancer cells.

these cell lines have activating KRAS mutations (G12A,
G12C, G12S, G12V or Q61H), while other cell lines
contain wild-type RAS alleles (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS)
and are not RAS-activated (Supplementary Table 1). All of
the cell lines were sensitive to MEK and PI3K inhibition,
as assessed by the activation status of ERK and AKT
(examples are shown in Figure 1A). Consistent with the
above result, combinations of MEK and PI3K inhibitors
exhibited marked cytostatic but not cytotoxic effects on all
cell lines tested (Supplementary Figure 1B). The combined
MEK/PI3K and HDAC inhibition greatly improved the
outcomes. The highest viability reduction (~80%) was
seen in KRAS mutant cells, whereas the lowest reduction
(~20%) was found in KRAS WT cells (Figure 1C, 1D).
To directly test whether expression of oncogenic KRAS is
sufficient to confer drug resistance, cells were maintained
in medium containing different concentrations of serum,
ranging from 5% to 0%, and their drug responses were
assessed after treating with cytotoxic compounds (Figure
1C, 1D). Tumor cell viability in serum-depleted media

did not change for up to 6 days. However, we observed
a further decrease of the viability of BGT-treated cells
in the low range of serum concentrations, with ~98%
of KRAS mutant cells succumbing to cell death after 3
days of treatment (Figure 1C). Hence, factors present in
serum, rather than KRAS alone, provide protection from
the cytotoxic effects of these drugs (further discussed
below). It is interesting to note that KRAS WT cell
lines were found to have varying levels of sensitivity
and resistance to BGT treatment (Figure 1D). Whether
this reflects additional mutations that can affect RAS
signaling is presently unclear. Extending our analysis,
we tested the impact of MEK/PI3K/HDAC inhibition
on a panel of colorectal (CRC) cells carrying single and
compound KRAS, BRAF and PI3K mutations (Table
1). We observed a relatively uniform response across all
cell lines tested, as the BGT inhibitor combination had a
measurable cytotoxic activity against KRAS/PI3K mutants
and BRAF/PI3K mutants, as well as those without dual
mutations (Supplementary Figure 1D). Overexpression

of exogenous mutant KRAS likewise conferred enhanced
drug sensitivity on NSCLC cell lines with WT RAS
alleles (Supplementary Figure 2C). Direct comparison
showed that low doses of BGT (0.2 μM) were more
effective than considerably higher concentrations (10
μM) of the currently accepted gemcitabine and cisplatinbased combinations (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure
2E). We therefore used this drug combination, alongside
gemcitabine and cisplatin (hereafter referred to as GC),
as a tool to identify the resistance mechanism(s) of lung
cancer cells and reveal targetable pathways to overcome
this resistance.

of primary lung cancers and NCI60 cell lines also did not
identify direct interactions involving RAS and MYC [21,
22]. Likewise, the genes that were up- or downregulated
in the NFkB module were distinct from those regulated
by either KRAS or MYC (Figure 2D). Thus, the genes
belonging to each of the three modules (KRAS, MYC and
NFkB) in KRAS-induced ADCs are regulated separately
and control different aspects of the malignant phenotype.
While surprisingly small overlap was observed between
the KRAS/AO and NFkB/AO modules, we found a
modest but statistically significant overlap between the
MYC/AO and MYC/TSA modules (55 and 46 genes,
respectively; p values of <0.0001 for each), suggesting
a possible component of drug-induced cell death (Figure
2C). The obtained prediction of antipodal effects of KRAS
and MYC induction on the drug sensitivity of cancer cells
was then tested experimentally.

Functional separation between resistance
mechanisms and KRAS mutation status
To better understand how the mutation status of
KRAS influences survival signaling in cancer cells, we
utilized data obtained from gene expression profiling of
mouse KRAS G12D-induced lung adenocarcinomas and
control untransformed cells, which we previously reported
[10]. The number of genes whose expression was changed
more than four- or twofold in KRAS-transformed cells
compared with controls was ~500 and 5000, respectively.
Relying on publicly available data sets (http://www.
broadinstitute.org), we defined gene expression modules
for KRAS, MYC, NFkB, TSA, and the onset of apoptosis
(AO) based on retrieved human cancer gene sets. Our
rationale for choosing these modules as relevant to the
KRAS pathway in cancer was as follows: it has been
demonstrated that MYC integrates RAS and PI3K signals
and that both under- and overexpression of MYC can
lead to cancer cell death [16, 17]. Likewise, the genetic
or pharmacological inhibition of NFkB enhances druginduced apoptosis in lung cancer mouse models [18, 19].
Although drug-induced apoptosis is often associated with
activation of JNK-AP1 signaling, the recruitment of AP1
(activator protein-1) is viewed as a consequence, rather
than a cause, of drug-induced cell death [20]. We found
that other candidate gene expression modules that could
potentially influence the cell death pathways, such as the
E2F, SRF (serum response factor), STAT3 and TGFB/
SMAD, were not consistently activated by KRAS G12D
in lung ADC (Supplementary Figure 3). Using these
module definitions, we then calculated mean module
activities for the control and tumor-derived KRAS G12D
cells (Figure 2A, 2B). As shown in Figure 2B, the KRAS
and MYC signatures are similar in ADC1 and ADC2 as
opposed to untransformed controls. However, although the
KRAS module is made up of >400 genes that are either
upregulated (44%) or downregulated (56%) in the tumor
cells, while the MYC module is comprised of >800 genes
that are upregulated (54%) or downregulated (46%), we
found that for each module, the up- and downregulated
genes are different. Only a small proportion (<2%) of these
genes overlap (Figure 2C). Earlier pathway-based analyses

Constitutive activation of KRAS does not sustain
high levels of MYC
MYC is an early response gene, not expressed in
growth arrested cells but rapidly induced in response to
growth factor stimulation [23]. Tissue-specific knockout
studies revealed that MYC functions in cell proliferation,
metabolism and maintenance of self-renewal in several
types of stem cells [9]. Suppression of MYC in cancer
cell lines reduces cell viability [24]. The current model
posits that RAS signaling affects MYC by two basic
mechanisms: PI3K inhibits phosphorylation of MYC
at T58, which blocks its proteolysis by the ubiquitin
proteasome system, while activated ERK phosphorylates
MYC at S62, which increases its stability [25, 7]. We
confirmed that growth factor-induced signaling mediates
the induction of MYC expression in cells bearing
constitutively active KRAS (Figure 3A). We also
confirmed that the potent inhibitors of MEK and PI3K
block tumor cell growth and MYC protein expression
(Figure 3B). Somewhat surprisingly, we found that the
steady state levels of MYC vary in NSCLC cell lines
regardless of the presence or absence of oncogenic
KRAS mutations, ranging from the levels seen in
normal cells (e.g. NIH3T3 and IMR90 cells, around or
less than 5,000 molecules per cell) to the levels seen in
many tumor cells (e.g. HeLa cells, >30,000 molecules
per cell) [26, 27]. For instance, high levels of MYC
were detected in HCC366 and H23 cell lines, which
have previously been reported to contain amplified myc
locus (Figure 3C). Other NSCLC cells, as well as KRAS
mutant CRC and PDAC cells, frequently showed a lower,
physiological level of MYC expression (Figure 3C and
Supplementary Figure 4A). Phosphorylation of MYC at
T58 and S62 was consistently present in all tumor cells
(Supplementary Figure 4B). We therefore sought to
examine whether MYC expression correlates with RAS
activation status in primary and cancer cell lines.

To that end, we analyzed primary LSL KRAS G12D
p53KO (inactive KRAS G12D allele) and KRAS G12D
p53KO (active KRAS G12D allele) lung epithelial cells
or tumors derived from these cells. We found that MYC
levels remained unchanged regardless of whether cells
expressed the KRAS G12D oncogene (Supplementary
Figure 4C). We generated human NSCLC cell lines
stably transduced with either activated or wild-type
RAS isoforms (HRAS, KRAS or NRAS) (Figure 3D).
We compared the three most common KRAS mutations
in lung ADC, namely G12C (42% of total KRAS
mutations), G12V (20%) and G12D (17%). Each of
these mutations generates a distinct signaling output, as
KRAS G12C signals primarily through RAL and KRAS

G12D signals primarily through PI3K as opposed to other
downstream effectors [28]. The analysis revealed that
two pools of MYC exist in KRAS-transformed cells (the
unstable, T58-phosphorylated pool, and the more stable,
non-phosphorylated pool), in agreement with previous
reports [29]. The expression of activated RAS mutants,
in the background of wild-type RAS alleles, caused a
decrease in phospho-T58 MYC without having a major
stabilizing effect on basal levels of MYC, possibly with
the exception of HRAS G12V (Figure 3D). Moreover,
ectopic expression of KRAS G12C, as opposed to KRAS
G12D and KRAS G12V mutants, induced reduction of
MYC levels in ~50% of all cell lines examined (Figure
3E). Ectopic expression of WT RAS isoforms also caused

a decrease in phospho-T58 MYC, implying that overactive
RAS signaling can either suppress the phosphorylation of
MYC at T58 or enhance the degradation process (Figure
3D). These data imply that the constitutive activation
of KRAS alone does not sustain high levels of MYC.
Supporting this notion, endogenous mutant KRAS was
inefficient in inducing MYC expression in A549 cells
maintained in media without serum (Figure 3A) or growth
arrested following treatment with MEK/PI3K inhibitors
(Figure 3E). Furthermore, the MYC T58A mutant that
cannot be phosphorylated on T58 was only moderately
more stable than endogenous MYC in KRAS mutant A549
cells (Figure 3E). That is, although MYC T58A is more
stable than WT MYC, it does not accumulate appreciably
in the context of mutant KRAS.
On the other hand, expression of constitutively
active PIK3CA H1047R and Myr-PDK1 mutants
stabilized MYC by ~2-fold, apparently by blocking
its phosphorylation-dependent degradation rather than
phosphorylation on the T58 or S62 sites per se, since
there was an increase in overall MYC levels, as well as
in the unstable, phosphorylated form of MYC (Figure
3E). Likewise, stable expression of BRAF V600E
confirmed a direct link between the V600E mutation
(and hence the activation of MAPK/ERK pathway) and
MYC stabilization (Figure 3F). Expression of the cancerderived EGFR mutant, commonly known as EGFRvIII,
also caused an increase in MYC above background
levels (Figure 3F). Of note, both BRAF V600E and
EGFRvIII promoted the stability of MYC either singly
phosphorylated at T58 or doubly phosphorylated at T58
and S62 (Figure 3F). In contrast, expression of activated
RALA, the third best characterized effector of RAS
signaling in cancer, had no effect on MYC accumulation
and phosphorylation (Figure 3F). The implication of these
findings is that KRAS signaling controls the basal levels,
but not the induced levels, of MYC (shown schematically
in Figure 3G). Although growth factor receptor systems,
such as those for EGF, are known to signal upstream of
RAS, they nonetheless account for differential expression
of MYC in KRAS-transformed cells. This may explain
why the development of KRAS-driven cancers is strongly
aided by elements of the tumor microenvironment,
including growth factors and cytokines [30, 31, 32].
Moreover, wild-type, but not oncogenic, RAS regulates
signaling from upstream RTKs [33].
We therefore sought to determine which of the
known KRAS effector pathways may act to limit the
accumulation of MYC protein. Logical candidates
include RHO family members RAC1 and CDC42,
which control pathways downstream of RAS [34, 35].
Both RAC1 and CDC42 exert their effects in part by
negatively regulating MYC through PAK-mediated
phosphorylation and degradation [36, 37]. RHO
signaling has also been implicated in the regulation of
GSK3-mediated MYC T58/S62 degradation pathway
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[38]. The expression of active RAC1 G12V and
CDC42 Q61L indeed caused a profound and sustained
decrease in the levels of MYC, even in the presence
of FBS (Figure 3F). The addition of the proteasome
inhibitor MG132 restored MYC levels (Supplementary
Figure 4D), confirming that MYC is regulated at
posttranslational levels through RAC1/CDC42 and
their effector pathways. In addition, serum-induced
expression of MYC was severely impaired, at both
the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, by
pharmacological inhibition of RAF (with AZ628), MEK
(GSK1120212), AKT (MKK2206), PLK1 (BI2536) and
CHK1 (AZD7762) (Figures 3H and 3I), highlighting the
redundancy of signaling mechanisms that control MYC
expression. The cytotoxic activity of gemcitabine alone
or in combination with cisplatin (GC) or GSK1120212
(GEMC/GSK) also caused a sustained downregulation
of MYC expression regardless of the presence of mutant
KRAS (Figure 3H and Supplementary Figure 4E).

Suppression of MYC enhances the sensitivity of
cancer cells to cytotoxic agents
The observed variability in MYC expression levels
among tumor cell lines with KRAS mutations prompted
us to investigate whether MYC plays a role in anticancer
drug resistance. To that end, we compared the effects of
gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC regimen) and BEZ/GSK/
TSA treatment (BGT regimen) on NSCLC and CRC cell
lines carrying wild-type or mutant KRAS alleles. We
reasoned that the use of two different drug combinations
can more readily identify key drug resistance pathways
than each regimen separately. Among cell lines with WT
KRAS (such as those in Figure 3C), there was a strong
positive correlation between the expression of MYC
and drug resistance (Figure 4A). In contrast, no such
correlation was found for KRAS mutant cell lines (Figure
4A). At face value, these data suggested that MYC is not
essential for treatment response in KRAS mutant tumor
cells. However, closer examination revealed that MYC
was suppressed in drug-treated cells and this suppression
was more pronounced in cells harboring KRAS
mutations (Figure 4B, 4C). We observed that the levels
of GTP-bound (active) RAS as well as total RAS were
consistently increased in cells exposed to either BGT or
GC treatment, while MYC levels declined (Figure 4B,
4C). The suppression of MYC by these drugs appeared
to be specific, since expression of other early response
genes, such as FOS, FOSB, JUN, JUND, and MYCN,
was either not affected or increased (Supplementary
Figure 5A). Overall, drug sensitive cell lines (such as
A549 or H727) could be distinguished from the resistant
cell lines (such as HOP62 or KRAS/PIK3CA double
mutants H460) based on a greater degree of MYC
suppression (Figure 4C, 4D).

Drug-induced cytotoxicity of KRAS mutant
cancer cells is contingent on MYC inhibition

and significantly in KRAS mutant than KRAS wild-type
cell lines (Figure 5D and Supplementary Figure 5B).
Because MYC induces genes involved in mitochondrial
energy metabolism, while its depletion can aggravate the
energy collapse [39], we evaluated the growth and survival
of KRAS mutant NSCLC and CRC cell lines transduced
with wild-type MYC or the MYCΔMBII mutant. This
mutant lacks the MBII domain of MYC, which is required
for transcriptional regulation by MYC family proteins
[40]. Ectopic expression of either wild-type or mutant
MYC did not affect the growth rate in any of the cell lines
(data not shown). However, expression of wild-type but
not mutant MYC attenuated drug-induced effects, such as
ATP depletion and induction of BIM upon GC treatment
(~2 fold, Figure 5D, 5E). Furthermore, while expression
of WT MYC conferred resistance on drug-treated cells
(Figure 5F), expression of MYCΔMBII or depletion of
MYC to approximately 30-50% using retrovirus-delivered
shRNAs reduced the resistance of cells (Supplementary
Figure 5C). It is noteworthy that drug treatment reduced

The inhibition of MYC expression in both treatment
conditions occurred prior to the induction of cell death
(Figure 5A, 5B). Both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant
cell lines arrested in G1 phase (BGT regimen) and G1/S
phase (GC regimen) of the cell cycle (examples are shown
in Figure 5C). However, cell cycle arrest did not confer
any protective effect on cell survival, as MYC suppression
with either concurrent ERK inhibition (BGT regimen)
or ERK activation (GC regimen) induced an increase
in the levels of pro-apoptotic BIM and the release of
cytochrome c (CYCS) from mitochondria (Figure 4B).
The ATP content (a marker of mitochondrial dysfunction
and energy crisis) in drug-treated cells fell accordingly
(Figure 5D and Supplementary Figure 5B). Moreover,
while mutant versus wild-type KRAS had no effect on
ATP production in untreated cells, and ATP levels in
both cell types dropped, they did so more precipitously

LTR-driven MYC expression to a lesser extent compared
with the suppression of endogenous MYC (Supplementary
Figure 6A). However, enforced MYC expression did not
induce apoptosis in epithelial cancer cells upon growth
factor withdrawal (Supplementary Figure 6A). Treatment
of serum-starved cells was accompanied by a proportional
reduction in the levels of both endogenous and ectopic

MYC proteins and subsequent growth arrest, thus
preventing the cell from entering mitosis (Supplementary
Figure 6B, 6C). Therefore, the induction of cell death is
not a stress response of the cells due to myc deregulation.
This may reflect the fact that the majority of human lung
and colon cancer cell lines (>80%) do not contain WT
TP53 alleles (Supplementary Table 1).

Activation of ERK facilitates MYC suppression
under drug induced stress conditions

The analysis revealed the following themes: 1) compared
with GC regimen, BGT treatment was less effective at
suppressing MYC expression, despite its potent inhibition
of ERK activation; 2) the extent of MYC suppression
in cell lines expressing the KRAS G12C or KRAS
G12V mutants was stronger than that in cells with the
KRAS G12D mutant; 3) in contrast, the constitutively
active mutant PIK3CA H1047R dramatically reduced
phosphorylation of ERK, but no detrimental effect on
MYC expression was detected (Figure 6A). Likewise,
mutations in EGFR, BRAF or CRAF did not alter

To explore systematically the apparent antagonism
between KRAS and MYC pathways and understand how
cytotoxic drugs alter MYC expression and cancer cell
viability, we measured their effects in isogenic NSCLC
cell lines with stable expression of exogenous KRAS
mutants (G12C, G12D and G12V) as well as upstream
(EGFR) and downstream (PIK3CA, BRAF, CRAF,
RALA) components of the RAS pathway (Figure 6A).

the extent of change in MYC (Figure 6A). Due to the
overall small number of NSCLC and CRC cell lines with
G12D mutation, we explored a panel of PDAC cell lines
(AsPC1, HPAFII, PANC1) carrying the KRAS G12D
alleles (Supplementary Table 1). Among the various
KRAS mutations, the G12D mutant has been reported to
be a stronger inducer of PI3K than RAF/MEK/ERK [28].
Pancreatic cell lines were indeed less sensitive to BGT
and GC treatment than cell lines carrying the KRAS G12C
or G12V mutation, as they exhibited only a modest (30%50%) reduction in MYC expression (Figure 4C). Together,
these data imply that either the activation status of MAPK/
ERK pathway has no bearing on MYC expression under
drug induced stress conditions, or that excess levels of
activated ERK facilitate this suppression.
To discriminate between these possibilities, we
examined NSCLC cells treated with gemcitabine/cisplatin
in combination with MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 (GC/G
regimen) and ERK inhibitor SCH772984 (GC/S regimen).
Under these conditions, blocking ERK activity indeed
caused an increase in MYC mRNA and protein levels
(Figure 6B, 6C). To confirm these unexpected results, we
examined the sensitivity of NSCLC cells toward GC/G
and GC/S treatment in the context of gain of function
mutations in the MAPK/ERK pathway. Notably, NSCLC
cells carrying KRAS G12D or BRAF V600E mutants
were more sensitive to MEK inhibition than control
GFP-transduced cells, as evidenced by partly restored
MYC expression upon GC/G treatment compared to GC
alone (Figure 6B, C). In contrast, NSCLC cells carrying
activating mutations in MEK1 (C121S) or ERK2 (R67S
D321N) failed to restore MYC expression (Figure 6B).
Prior studies have shown that MEK1 C121S or functionally
similar mutations confer resistance to MEK inhibition in
vitro [41, 42]. A distinctive feature of sustained MAPK/
ERK signaling is thus the dual role in MYC regulation
under normal and stress conditions. In cells with DNA
damage, hyperactivation of ERK blocks MYC expression
and prevents cell division. This can be achieved through
several mechanisms, including the phosphorylation and
activation of DNA damage response (DDR) factors,
decreased gene transcription and modulation of posttranscriptional processes. Thus, in addition to their
various functions during transcriptional activation, ERK
kinases are known to interact with the RNA polymerase II
C-terminal domain (RNAPII CTD) and to phosphorylate
S5 in RNAPII CTD, thus establishing a stalled form
of RNAPII [43, 44]. Conversely, inhibition of ERK
activation partly relieves this block (shown schematically
in Figure 6D). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found
that combining GC treatment with MEK/ERK inhibition
reduces cell death and increases the resistance of cells
to chemotherapy in vitro (Supplementary Figure 6D).
This increase, moreover, appears to be dependent on
re-expression of MYC. It is noteworthy that isogenic
cell lines carrying PIK3CA H1047R mutation did not
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

respond to MEK/ERK inhibition, as in these cells MYC
levels remained largely unchanged (Figure 6B). Thus,
PIK3CA controls MYC expression in a MAPK/ERKindependent or possibly parallel manner under both
normal and stress conditions. This may explain marginal
effects of the combination treatment using PI3K inhibitors
(BEZ235 and GDC0941), PDK1 inhibitor (OSU03012)
and AKT inhibitor (MKK2206) on KRAS mutant cells
in comparison with GC treatment alone (Supplementary
Figure 6). These results affirm the importance of MYC
dependency in the context of mutant KRAS and suggest
novel mechanisms of resistance to anticancer agents that
may have important clinical implications.

DISCUSSION
Until recently, there has been a general consensus
that MYC plays a key role in the development of many
human cancers, even though enhanced cell growth caused
by MYC is countered by higher rates of apoptosis [9].
Whether MYC is also required for tumor maintenance
and whether tumor cells become addicted to MYC was
previously unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated
that blocking MYC function may be sufficient to stop
tumor growth and induce tumor regression in the wellcharacterized LSL KRAS G12D mouse models of NSCLC
and PDAC [45, 46, 47]. Inhibition of MYC overcomes
drug resistance in BRAF-driven melanoma and other
human cancers [48, 49, 50]. These studies have endorsed
MYC as a compelling therapeutic target. Given the
challenge of inhibiting KRAS directly and the role of
MYC in various aspects of cancer progression, therapy
for treating KRAS-driven cancers may also be expected to
depend on MYC. Our data support the notion that KRAS
mutant cancer cells depend on the continued expression
of MYC and drug-induced cytotoxicity of KRAS mutant
cells is contingent on MYC inhibition. We sought to
assess the role of oncogenic KRAS in the regulation
of MYC expression in cell lines derived from lung and
colorectal tumors and the effects of MYC on cellular
cytotoxicity and drug sensitivity according to KRAS
mutation status. To that end, we performed a large scale
analysis of NSCLC and CRC cell lines carrying single
and compound mutations in the KRAS, BRAF and PI3K
genes. We evaluated the cytotoxic effects of the currently
accepted therapeutic agents (gemcitabine plus cisplatin)
and novel targeted compounds (MEK, PI3K and HDAC
inhibitors) on the drug sensitivity versus resistance of
KRAS mutant and KRAS wild-type cancer cells. There are
several important findings in our results. First, systematic
investigation of NSCLC and CRC cell lines revealed that
KRAS mutation paradoxically enhances the sensitivity
of cells to cytotoxic agents. We identify MYC as a key
component of this process and show that MYC plays an
essential cell-intrinsic role in maintaining the survival of
KRAS mutant cancer cells. Second, we demonstrate that
18005

Oncotarget

constitutive activation of KRAS does not sustain high
levels of MYC. Moreover, MYC is strongly suppressed
in drug-sensitive cells and this suppression is facilitated
by the presence of oncogenic KRAS mutations. Third, we
find that activation of ERK potentiates the cytotoxicity
of gemcitabine and cisplatin in NSCLC cell lines by
suppressing MYC expression. Conversely, MEK/ERK
inhibition reduces the effectiveness of gemcitabine and
cisplatin treatment and increases the resistance of cells
to chemotherapy in vitro. Our findings support the idea
that treatment of KRAS-driven NSCLC and CRC, and
potentially the other mutant KRAS driven cancers, may
benefit from the concurrent inhibition of KRAS signaling
and MYC. In sum, although MYC has traditionally been
regarded to be a pro-apoptotic protein, drug-induced
cytotoxicity of KRAS mutant cancer cells appears to
depend on MYC inhibition.
MYC expression is regulated at multiple levels,
including transcription, translation and protein stability
[6]. Despite clear evidence that MYC deregulation
contributes to cancer, the overall MYC expression in
several common malignancies, such as lung, colorectal and
pancreatic cancer, remains within the normal range [3, 51,
52]. For instance, MYC genes (MYC, MYCN and MYCL)
are amplified and/or overexpressed in 15–30% of small
cell lung cancer (SCLC) but less frequently in NSCLC
[53]. Recent data show that KRAS mutation alone does
not cause activation of the MYC gene at the transcriptional
level [10, 54]. This raises questions about how KRAS and
other signaling proteins can stabilize MYC expression
through a post-transcriptional mechanism. The prevailing
model holds that the activated form of HRAS (historically
referred to as RAS) enhances the accumulation of MYC
activity by stabilizing the MYC protein. According to this
model, PI3K inhibits phosphorylation of MYC at T58,
which blocks its ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, while
ERK phosphorylates MYC at S62, which increases its
stability [25, 7]. It follows that the oncogenicity of HRAS
(typically referred to as RAS V12) will further augment
MYC levels and activity, and therefore the signaling
pathways and mechanisms used by these genes are hard
to separate. In the context of MYC-driven cell cycle
progression, this seems to fit with the observations that
the expression of MYC in mid-G1 phase is associated with
sustained RAS activity[55]. In addition, MEFs devoid of
all three RAS isoforms (RAS-less MEFs) display cell
cycle arrest and the repression of a series of cell cyclerelated genes, including MYC [56]. However, while this
model may account for the differences in MYC protein
expression in normal cells, our data demonstrate that the
interactions between oncogenic KRAS and MYC do not
fall into easily recognizable within-pathway relationships
that are commonly associated with oncogenic HRAS.
Although MYC is clearly required for the maintenance
of KRAS-driven cancer, our data imply that the KRAS
oncogene is inefficient in sustaining expression of MYC in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the absence of growth factors or in response to anticancer
drug treatment. We therefore infer that KRAS and MYC
are regulated separately and control different aspects of the
malignant phenotype. Moreover, with MYC expression
data obtained before rather than during treatment, KRAS
WT but not KRAS mutant cancer cells can be classified
in terms of whether they would be sensitive or resistant
to cytotoxic drugs. Among RAS genes, KRAS is the most
frequently mutated gene in cancer (85% of RAS-driven
cancers), while HRAS is the least frequently mutated
gene (3%) (COSMIC). Why KRAS mutations prevail in
colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancer, while NRAS or
BRAF are mutated more frequently in skin melanoma,
and HRAS mutations are predominant in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma is not yet clear. Likewise, it is
unclear why oncogenic mutations of PI3K are common in
a broader variety of human tumors. Further investigation
of these cancer driver genes will be required to reveal
novel insights into MYC biology and answer the question
whether MYC or MYC’s target genes can be targeted for
cancer therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mammalian cells and reagents
We used previously described pretumor and tumorderived KRAS G12D p53KO lung epithelial cell lines [10].
These cells were grown on gelatinized plates in CnT-17
medium (CellnTec). Human cell lines were obtained from
the ATCC or from individual scientists and were not further
authenticated. Cell lines were cultured in RPMI or DMEM
media supplemented with 5% FBS and 1x antibiotic/
antimycotic, as recommended by ATCC, unless otherwise
specified. For long-term cell proliferation assays, cells were
seeded into 6-well plates (4x105 cells per well) and cultured
both in the absence and presence of serum and drugs as
indicated below. Inhibitors targeting MEK (PD0325901
and GSK1120212), PI3K (BEZ235 and GDC0941), HDAC
(SAHA and TSA) (all from Selleckchem.com) were prepared
as 100 μM stocks in DMSO. Cells were treated with various
concentrations of the compounds for 3 days, followed by a
1 day drug-free recovery period, and their proliferation was
determined by Coulter counter. For intermittent inhibition,
cells were subjected to three rounds of 3 day treatment, each
followed by a 3 day drug-free period, over the course of
18 days. Cell viability was measured using propidium iodide
(PI) staining. ATP content was measured using CellTiter-Glo
kit (Promega). Retroviral vectors encoding HRAS, KRAS,
