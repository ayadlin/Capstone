BACKGROUND: Bortezomib is active for newly diagnosed and relapsed multiple myeloma, and it has synergistic activity with melphalan. The authors of this report conducted a randomized trial to determine the safety and efficacy of
adding bortezomib to a preparative regimen of arsenic trioxide (ATO), ascorbic acid (AA), and melphalan. METHODS:
Among 60 patients who enrolled between October 2006 and September 2007, 58 patients underwent autologous
transplantation with a preparative regimen of melphalan 200 mg/m2 intravenously, AA 1000 mg daily intravenously
for 7 days, and ATO 0.25 mg/kg intravenously for 7 days. Patients were randomized to receive no bortezomib (Group
1), bortezomib 1 mg/m2  3 doses (Group 2), and bortezomib 1.5 mg/m2  3 doses (Group 3). Primary endpoints
were complete response (CR), grade IV toxicity, and 90-day treatment-related mortality (TRM). Secondary endpoints
were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The median follow-up of all surviving
patients was 36 months (range, 20-43 months). The CR rates in Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 20%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. Grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities and TRM were comparable. The median OS was not reached in the
groups, whereas the median PFS in Groups 1, 2, and 3 was 17.8 months, 17.4 months, and 20.7 months, respectively.
PFS and OS were significantly shorter in patients who had high-risk cytogenetics (P ¼ .016 and P ¼ .0001, respectively) and relapsed disease (P ¼ .0001 and P ¼ .0001, respectively) regardless of the treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Adding bortezomib to a preparative regimen of ATO, AA, and high-dose melphalan was safe and well
tolerated in patients with multiple myeloma. There was no significant improvement in the CR rate, PFS, or OS in the

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy and is responsible for approximately
1% of all cancer-related deaths in Western countries.1 Current treatment options include induction therapy followed by
consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HCT) in eligible patients.2 At least 2 randomized trials have demonstrated that auto-HCT results in a significantly prolonged event-free
survival and overall survival (OS) compared with conventional chemotherapy in patients with MM.3,4 Although autoHCT is safe with a transplantation-related mortality (TRM) rate of <2%, it is associated with a continuing risk of disease
relapse.5 Attempts at improving outcomes with more intensive regimens have not been successful.5-8 Thus, further exploration of novel preparative regimens is warranted.
Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, is an active agent in newly diagnosed as well as relapsed and refractory MM.
Several large clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of bortezomib in MM.9-11 In vitro exposure of

melphalan-resistant myeloma cell lines to noncytotoxic
concentrations of bortezomib increased sensitivity to melphalan.12,13 In 1 preclinical study, subtoxic concentrations of bortezomib potently sensitized MM cell lines and
patient cells to the DNA-damaging activity of melphalan,
including cells that were resistant to melphalan.13 In addition, combining bortezomib with oral melphalan produced acceptable toxicity and encouraging responses in
patients who were resistant to either agent alone.14
Bortezomib has been used in combination with
high-dose melphalan as part of conditioning regimens in
at least 2 clinical trials.14,15 We previously demonstrated
the feasibility of combining arsenic trioxide (ATO) with
ascorbic acid (AA) and high-dose melphalan in patients
with relapsed MM.16 This combination was well tolerated
and resulted in a response rate of 87%. On the basis of
these data, we conducted a randomized phase 2 clinical
trial assessing the safety and efficacy of bortezomib in
combination with high-dose melphalan, AA, and ATO.
We postulated that the combination of these antimyeloma
drugs would improve the complete response (CR) rate,
which is a surrogate for improved disease-free survival and
OS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were enrolled from October 2006 to September
2007. The inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of MM, age
75 years, Zubrod performance status <2, left ventricular ejection fraction >40% with no uncontrolled arrhythmia or unstable cardiac disease, a corrected QT interval
<470 milliseconds, adequate pulmonary function test
results with no symptomatic pulmonary disease, serum
bilirubin <2 times the upper limit of normal, and serum
glutamic pyruvic transaminase <4 times the upper limit
of normal with no evidence of chronic active hepatitis or
cirrhosis. Other inclusion criteria were the absence of effusions or ascites >1 L before drainage, negative human immunodeficiency virus testing, a negative pregnancy test in
a woman with child-bearing potential, and the willingness
of the patient or guardian to provide informed consent.
Treatment Plan
Peripheral blood stem cells were mobilized and collected
after granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor (G-CSF)
alone or chemotherapy plus G-CSF according to standard
institutional guidelines. Patients were randomized to 1 of
the 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Table 1 depicts

the treatment schema. All patients received ATO 0.25
mg/kg intravenously on days 9 to 3 over 2 hours, AA
1000 mg intravenously on days 9 to 3 over 30
minutes, and melphalan 100 mg/m2 intravenously on
days 4 and 3 over 30 minutes. The dose of ATO was
administered after melphalan in all patients. Group 1 did
not receive bortezomib and served as a control. Patients
received supportive care according to established departmental guidelines. Patients received G-CSF 5 lg/kg daily
from day þ1 until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
was 0.5  109/L for 2 consecutive days. Oral levofloxacin,
acyclovir, and fluconazole were given for the duration of
neutropenia. Blood products were given for hemoglobin
levels <8 g/dL and platelet counts <20  109/L.
Response Criteria
The primary endpoints were CR, time to grade IV toxicity, and death. The secondary endpoints were response
rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and OS. Toxicity
was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (version 3.1; Bethesda, Md).
Engraftment was defined as an ANC of 0.5  109/L for 2
consecutive days. Response was defined according to the
criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group.17
PFS was calculated from the date of auto-HCT to the date
of disease progression or the time last known alive. OS
was calculated from the date of auto-HCT to the date of
death or time last known alive.
Prognostic Factors
High-risk cytogenetics and molecular characteristics were
defined as: deletion 13 (del13) or hypodiploidy on

conventional cytogenetics; and as translocation t(4;14),
t(14;16), or del(17p) on conventional cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization.18
Statistical Analyses
Patient characteristics were summarized using the mean
and standard deviation for numerical valued variables and
frequencies with percentages for categorical variables. Differences in the distributions of patient characteristics
between the 3 treatment groups and associations between
variables were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test for
numerical variables19 or generalized Fisher exact tests20,21
for categorical variables. Unadjusted probabilities of OS
and PFS were estimated using the method of Kaplan and
Meier.22 The log-rank test23 was used to compare unadjusted OS and PFS between subgroups. Bayesian regression models24 were fit to assess the joint effects of patient
covariates and treatment arms on both OS and PFS, and
the best fitting model was chosen for each outcome from
the exponential, Weibull, log-logistic, log-normal, and
gamma distributions using Bayesian Information Criterion.25 In each multivariate regression model, the covariates included treatment arm, sex, race, age, disease stage,
diagnostic status (defined by the 3 subgroups: first remission consolidation without progressive disease [PD] as a
baseline group, no first remission consolidation without
PD, and PD), cytogenetics (high risk or standard risk),26
and prior response category (PD, partial response/very
good partial response [PR/VGPR], stable disease). For
each model fit, we assumed that each parameter in the linear term followed a noninformative, normal prior with
mean of 0 and variance of 10,000. All frequentist statistical analyses were carried out in R (The R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and Bayesian
computations in Open BUGS version 3.1.2 (Mathstat,
Helsinki, Finland).27

RESULTS
Patients
From October 2006 to September 2007, 60 patients were
assigned randomly to 3 treatment groups with 20 patients
enrolled in each group. Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of the 60 patients enrolled in this study, including
58 patients who eventually underwent auto-HCT. One
patient in treatment Group 3 developed deep venous
thrombosis before completing the preparative regimen
and was withdrawn from the study. A second patient in
Group 1 developed pneumonia and sepsis before receiv-

ing high-dose melphalan and died 2 months later of multiorgan failure. The mean age (standard deviation) of
patients at the time of transplantation was 60 years (6.5
years), 57 years (6.1 years), and 63 years (7.9 years) in
treatment Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The patients
were well matched clinically, whereas high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities were present in 1 patient (5%) in
Group 1, 4 patients (15%) in Group 2, and 4 patients
(20%) in Group 3. Fifteen patients (25%) developed
recurrent disease before auto-HCT (6 patients in Group
1, 6 patients in Group 3, and 3 patients in Group 3), and
6 patients had undergone previous auto-HCT. The median interval between diagnosis and auto-HCT was 12
months, 9 months, and 10 months in Groups 1, 2, and 3,
respectively. Sixteen patients (6 patients in Group 1, 6
patients in Group 2, and 4 patients in Group 3) had
>10% plasma cells in the bone marrow at the time they
underwent auto-HCT.
Stem Cell Mobilization and Engraftment
Forty-nine patients (81%) were mobilized with G-CSF
10 lg/kg daily or with pegylated G-CSF alone given subcutaneously. Eleven patients (18%) with high tumor burden received chemotherapy and G-CSF 10 lg/kg daily
using the modified CVAD regimen (cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) to achieve
cytoreduction and mobilization.28 The median CD34 cell
dose in Groups 1, 2, and 3 was 4.2  106/kg, 4.1  106/
kg, and 3.6  106/kg, respectively. All patients were
engrafted with a median time to neutrophil engraftment
(ANC >500/dL) of 10 days in each group, and there were
no engraftment failures or delays in any of the 3 cohorts.
The median time to a platelet count of >20  109/L was
10 days (range, 7-17 days), 11 days (range, 7-31 days),
and 10 days (range 5-17 days), respectively, for the 3
groups.
Induction Therapy
In the 45 newly diagnosed patients who proceeded to
auto-HCT to consolidate the initial response, the following induction regimens were used: thalidomide plus
dexamethasone (14 patients), lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (12 patients), bortezomib plus dexamethasone (14 patients; 10 received had thalidomide, and 2
received lenalidomide added to the combination), and
other (5 patients). None of the patients were in CR
before auto-HCT because of the existing institutional
practice of delaying the auto-HCT until a relapse
occurred in patients who achieved a CR to induction. In

groups (P ¼ 1.0). Grade 3-4 toxicities were similar and
were observed in 10 patients (50%) in Group 1 (mucositis
in 3, tachycardia in 2, chest pain in 1, venous thrombosis
in 1, dyspnea in 1, acute renal failure in 1, and pleural
effusion in 1), 10 patients (50%) in Group 2 (mucositis in
2, tachycardia in 1, hypotension in 1, pneumonia in 1,
and pulmonary edema in 1), and 12 patients (60%) in
Group 3 (left ventricular dysfunction in 1, chest pain in 1,
hypertension in 1, pulmonary edema in 2, pleural effusion
in 1,dyspnea in 1, mucositis in 1, intestinal obstruction in
1, and elevated transaminases in 1) (Table 3). The most
common adverse events were fluid retention (78%), nausea (65%), and diarrhea (63%). Grade 1 and 2 weight
gain because of fluid retention was observed in 75%,
70%, and 90% of patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3,

disease at auto-HCT emerged as predictors of poor outcome (Table 4). Fifty-one patients had standard-risk cytogenetics, and 9 patients had high-risk cytogenetics based
on published criteria.26 The median PFS for patients with
high-risk cytogenetics versus patients with standard-risk
cytogenetics was 5.7 months versus 21.8 months (P ¼
.016), and the median OS for patients with high-risk cytogenetics versus patients with standard-risk cytogenetics
was 15.9 months (P ¼ .0001) (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the
median PFS (P ¼ .0001) and the median OS (P ¼ .0001)
were significantly shorter in patients with recurrent disease (Fig. 3). There was no significant difference in terms
of response rate or PFS between growth factor versus
chemotherapy plus growth factor mobilization. Thirty-5
of the 60 patients had received bortezomib as part of their
induction or salvage therapy. There was no significant difference in CR þ VGPR, PFS, or OS between those who
received bortezomib before auto-HCT versus those who
did not.

DISCUSSION
We report here the results of the first randomized phase 2
trial incorporating the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
into the conditioning regimen for auto-HCT in MM.
Melphalan 200 mg/m2 is considered the standard conditioning regimen. Attempts to intensify this regimen have
not been successful because of increased toxicity.5-8,16 On
the basis of antimyeloma activity exhibited by bortezomib
in combination with alkylating agents, we designed this
randomized phase 2 trial to test the safety and efficacy of
bortezomib in combination with high-dose melphalan.1215,29
Patients in the 3 randomized groups were compara-

ble. There were no patients in CR at the time of autoHCT, although 80% had at least a PR. There was no difference in the time to neutrophil or platelet engraftment,
and comparable grade III and IV toxicities were observed
between the 3 treatment groups. The TRM rate was 1.6%
with only 1 death in Group 1. At a median follow-up of
36 months, the primary endpoint of CR was achieved in
20%, 10%, and 10% of patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3,
respectively. There was no significant improvement in
median PFS or OS in the groups that received bortezomib. Patients with relapsed disease and high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities had significantly shorter PFS and OS.
Historic data from our institution suggest a median
PFS of 21 months after auto-HCT performed immediately after induction therapy.6 The PFS in relapsed
patients who undergo auto-HCT at our institution is
approximately 12 months.30 The lack of benefit in the
bortezomib-treated groups in the current study may be
attributed to several factors, such as the possibility that
concomitant administration of AA may have compromised the efficacy of bortezomib, as reported by several
investigators.31,32 Also, the inclusion of a large proportion
of patients (25%) with relapsed disease who are known to
have worse outcome most likely also contributed.30
We identified 2 previous clinical trials that studied
the incorporation of bortezomib into a melphan-based
conditioning regimen for myeloma.15,29 The first study
was a single-arm trial by the French Myeloma Intergroup
(IFM) that used a matched historic control design.15 The
conditioning regimen included bortezomib 1 mg/m2
given on days 6, 3, þ1, and þ4, and melphalan 200
mg/m2 given on day 2, and autologous cell reinfusion
on day 0. Fifty-four patients (median age, 58 years; range,

40-65 years) were treated on that trial. Fifty-four percent
of patients received induction therapy with combined vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone; 33% received
induction therapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone;
and 13% received >2 lines of therapy. After auto-HCT
with the bortezomib-melphalan conditioning, 32%
achieved a CR, and 70% were had a CR þ VGPR at 3
months after autologous stem cell transplantation. In a
matched control analysis with patients from the IFM
2005-01 trial of high-dose melphalan only, the CR rate
was higher in the bortezomib-melphalan group versus the

melphalan only group (35% vs 11%; P ¼ .001), regardless of induction therapy. Compared with the IFM study,
more patients (25%) in our trial had relapsed disease, and
no patient was in CR at the time of auto-HCT. Although
the CR rate was lower in our study, perhaps because we
included patients with more advanced disease, the CR þ
VGPR rate of >60% was not much different from the
70% rate reported in the IFM trial. Although the IFM
study did report cytogenetic abnormalities, no information was available regarding the outcome of high-risk
patients.

Original Article

The second study evaluated the synergy between bortezomib and melphalan in the high-dose setting, the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib in combination with
melphalan, and the timing bortezomib administration
(before or after melphalan).29 Only patients with <VGPR
after 1 or more induction regimens were enrolled and were
randomized to receive a single escalating dose of bortezomib
(1.0 mg/m2, 1.3 mg/m2, or 1.6 mg/m2) either 24 hours
before or 24 hours after high-dose melphalan. Bone marrow
was collected before the initiation of therapy and at the time
of transplantation to evaluate the sequence associated with
maximal plasma cell apoptosis. Among 39 randomized
patients, 19 received bortezomib before melphalan, and 20
patients received bortezomib after melphalan. Toxicity and
post-transplantation hematopoietic recovery were similar in
both arms. The overall response rate was 87%, and 51% of
patients achieved a VGPR or better. Pharmacodynamic
studies revealed greater plasma cell apoptosis among
patients who received bortezomib after melphalan. Unlike
the IFM study, patients aged >65 years were included;
patients were heavily pretreated, including with prior autologous transplantation; and no patients were in CR or
VGPR at the time of auto-HCT. The TRM rate was 5%,
and there was 1 death from severe ileus and another from
Para influenza virus infection. The median time to engraftment of neutrophils and platelets was 12 days and 16 days,
respectively. At a median follow-up of 17.3 months, the
overall response rate was 87%, and with 72% of patients
achieved a >VGPR post-transplantation. Among the
patients who had previous exposure to bortezomib, 57%
achieved >VGPR post-transplantation. Although the dose
and frequency of bortezomib in that trial were different
from ours, the patient population was relatively comparable. Like our study, the trial by Lonial et al also included
heavily pretreated patients, none of whom was in CR before
transplantation. The CR þ VGPR rates were comparable
to our trial. Even with the inclusion of patients who had
advanced disease, the PFS was 15.3 months, which was
comparable to the PFS of 17 to 20 months in our trial.
We conclude that adding bortezomib to a preparative regimen of ATO, AA, and high-dose melphalan is
safe and well tolerated in patients with MM with no
increase in grade III and IV toxicity or TRM. However,
there was no significant improvement in CR, PFS, or OS
at either dose level (1 mg/m2 or 1.5 mg/m2) in this group
of patients. A prospective study of bortezomib and highdose melphalan without AA and ATO that excludes
patients with relapsed disease may better define the role of
bortezomib in this setting.
