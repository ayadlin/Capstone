Abstract
Bit1 is a proapoptotic mitochondrial protein associated with anoikis. Upon cell detachment, Bit1 is released
into the cytoplasm and triggers caspase-independent cell death. Bit1 consists of 179 amino acids; for the
C-terminal, two thirds of the molecule functions as a peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, whereas the N-terminus contains a
mitochondrial localization signal. Here, we localize the cell death domain (CDD) to the N-terminal 62 amino acids
of Bit1 by transfecting cells with truncated Bit1 cDNA constructs. CDD was more potent in killing cells than the
full-length Bit1 protein when equivalent amounts of cDNA were transfected. To develop Bit1 CDD into a cancer
therapeutic, we engineered a recombinant protein consisting of the CDD fused to iRGD, which is a tumor-speciﬁc
peptide with unique tumor-penetrating and cell-internalizing properties. iRGD-CDD internalized into cultured
tumor cells through a neuropilin-1–activated pathway and triggered cell death. Importantly, iRGD-CDD spread
extensively within the tumor when injected intratumorally into orthotopically implanted breast tumors in mice.
Repeated treatment with iRGD-CDD strongly inhibited tumor growth, resulting in an average reduction of 77%
in tumor volume and eradication of some tumors. The caspase independence of Bit1-induced cell death makes
CDD a potentially attractive anticancer agent, because tumor resistance to the main mechanisms of apoptosis
is circumvented. Using iRGD to facilitate the spreading of a therapeutic agent throughout the tumor mass may
be a useful adjunct to local therapy for tumors that are surgically inoperable or difﬁcult to treat systemically.

Introduction
Cell–matrix interactions are important for cell survival and
failure of cells to adhere to the extracellular matrix results in
anoikis (1). Bit1 is a mitochondrial peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase
that causes cell death when released into the cytoplasm or
experimentally expressed there (2). Bit1 release occurs upon
loss of cell attachment, resulting in cell death (2). Bit1 negatively regulates extracellular signal–regulated kinase (Erk)
activation, revealing a possible molecular pathway for the
anoikis regulation (3, 4). Cytosolic Bit1 interacts with the
Groucho family transcriptional coregulator amino-terminal
enhancer of split (AES) to induce caspase-independent cell
death (2). These activities and the ability of Bit1 to counteract

transducin-like enhancer of split 1 (TLE1), which is an antiapoptotic oncoprotein, suggest a tumor suppressor role for
Bit1 (2, 5, 6). A unique property of Bit1 is that cell attachment
through certain integrins can prevent cell death induced by
cytoplasmic Bit1, whereas various antiapoptotic signaling
molecules, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, PI-3K, and Akt, can prevent
the release of Bit1 from mitochondria but are unable to rescue
the cell death caused by cytoplasmic Bit1 (2).
Bit1 is a 179-amino acid protein in which amino acids 63 to
179 at the C-terminus of the molecule constitute the catalytic,
peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase 2 (Pth2) domain, and the N-terminus
serves as a mitochondrial localization signal (2, 7). It is also
known that the N-terminal domain is needed for the apoptotic
activity (2, 7), but the active site has not been mapped in detail
and the mechanism whereby Bit1 causes cell death is not fully
understood. We undertook this study to deﬁne the cell death
domain (CDD) of Bit1, delineate its mechanism of action, and
explore its use as an antitumor drug. To deliver Bit1 CDD
protein into tumor cells and deal with the problem of poor
penetration of anticancer drugs in solid tumors (8, 9), we used
so-called C-end Rule or CendR peptides. These peptides contain a CendR motif (R/KXXR/K), which binds to neuropilin-1
(NRP-1) triggering a cell internalization and tissue penetration
pathway (10, 11). The CendR motif has to be at the C-terminus
of the peptide to be active. The iRGD peptide contains a cryptic
CendR motif (sequence: CRGDKGPDC; CendR motif underlined). This peptide activates the CendR pathway speciﬁcally in
tumors because it ﬁrst binds to avb3 and avb5 integrins, which

are expressed in tumor vessels and various types of other cells
within tumors but not in normal tissues. Having bound to the
integrins in a tumor, iRGD is proteolytically cleaved to generate
a fragment with a C-terminal CendR motif that binds to NRP-1
and activates the CendR pathway (10).

Materials and Methods
Reagents, cell lines, and tumors
Mouse anti-human NRP-1 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Miltenyi Biotec Inc; rabbit anti-Ki-67 polyclonal
antibody was from Abcam; mouse anti-b-actin monoclonal
antibody was from Sigma-Aldrich; the secondary antibodies
used were Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat immunoglobulin
G (IgG; Invitrogen Life Technologies). Full-length cDNA for
Bit1 in the mammalian expression vector pCMV-myc were
generated previously in the laboratory (2). QuikChange
Mutagenesis Kit for Bit1 mutagenesis was purchased from
Agilent Technologies. In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit for
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) and FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent
for overexpression was purchased from Roche Applied Science. MTT for cell viability assay was from Invitrogen Life
Technologies.
Cell lines of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, prostate
cancer PPC1, and mouse breast cancer 4T1 were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Human
tumor cell line M21 was a gift from Dr. David Cheresh at
University of California, San Diego (San Diego, CA). Human
breast cancer cell line MCF-10CA1a was obtained from the
Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI). All the
human cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with glutamine containing 10% FBS,
penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 C and 5% CO2. The mouse
4T1 cell line was maintained in Iscove's Modiﬁed Dulbecco's
Medium with glutamine containing 10% FBS, penicillin, and
streptomycin. The HEK 293T and 4T1 cells were recently
purchased from the ATCC and did not require further authentication. Seventeen short tandem repeat (STR) proﬁling by
ATCC Cell Authentication Service authenticated the MCF10CA1a and PPC1 (PC3) cells lines. The M21 showed similarity
to the HTB-129 (MDA-MB-435S) line in this analysis. The origin
of these cells is not critical for our purposes because we only
used these cells to represent NRP-1-deﬁcient, av integrinpositive cells.
To produce orthotopic tumors, 1 million of tumor cells in
100 mL of PBS were injected into the mammary fat pad of mice.
Athymic nude mice (Harlan Laboratories) were used for MCF10CA1a cells and normal Balb/C mice (Charles River) for 4T1
cells. All animal procedures were carried out in compliance
with the guidelines approved by the Animal Research Committee at the University of California, Santa Barbara (Santa
Barbara, CA).
Construction and production of recombinant CDD
proteins
Recombinant CDD proteins were prepared as follows:
the CDD sequence was cloned into the bacterial expression
vector pRSET containing a hexahistidine tag (Invitrogen Life

www.aacrjournals.org

Technologies). Because CDD harbors a mitochondrial signal
peptide, a myc-tag was placed at the N-terminus of CDD to
prevent the fusion protein from localizing to mitochondria. To
generate cell- and tissue-penetrating CDD proteins, oligonucleotides encoding the CendR peptides, RPARPAR (11) or iRGD
(sequence: CRGDKGPDC; ref. 10) were synthesized and ligated
to the downstream of oligonucleotides encoding the CDD, with
a glycine–serine linker placed in between (Supplementary Fig.
S1A). All construct sequences were conﬁrmed by DNA
sequencing. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21
(DE3) plysS strain (Novagen) after induction at 30 C for 24
hours using MagicMedia E. coli Expression Medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The recombinant proteins were puriﬁed using
nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid afﬁnity chromatography under
€
native conditions by using AKTA
fast protein liquid chromatography system. The bound proteins were eluted with 20
mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer containing 300 mmol/L
imidazole, pH 8.0. The eluates were dialyzed against PBS pH
7.4 containing an additional 360 mmol/L NaCl. In some
experiments, the his-tag was removed using enterokinase
(Invitrogen Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bit1 CDD proteins migrated as major
bands at 13 kDa (CDD) and 16 kDa (RPARPAR-CDD and
iRGD-CDD) in Coomassie blue–stained 4% to 20% SDSPAGE. The protein identities were conﬁrmed by immunoblotting using antibodies against his-tag or myc-tag (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Labeled recombinant proteins were
prepared by conjugating with a Dylight 550 NHS ester dye
(Dy550; Pierce Biotechnology) at amine groups. The labeled
protein was dialyzed and ﬁltered (0.22 mm). Absorbance
measurement was used to determine the dye concentration
and degree of labeling, which was somewhat less than an
average of 1 dye group per protein molecule.
Cell internalization of the recombinant proteins
Subconﬂuent tumor cells on chamber slides (Nalge Nunc
International) were incubated with 3 mmol/L Dy550-labeled
protein between 30 minutes and 24 hours. The cells were then
washed 3 times with PBS and ﬁxed with ice-cold methanol for
10 minutes. The specimens were mounted with 40 ,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI)-containing Vectashield media (Vector
Laboratories) and analyzed under a confocal microscope,
Olympus Fluoview 500.
Peptide-conjugated dextran was used to inhibit peptideCDD protein for cell internalization. A thiol-reactive dextran
conjugate was prepared by modifying amino-dextran 10 kDa
(5.1 amines per strand, Invitrogen Life Technologies) with
N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate (SPDP), and
dialyzed using Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassettes 3,500 molecular
weight cut off (Pierce Biotechnology). To the SPDP-dextran,
an excess Cys-peptide was added, followed by extensive dialysis. Each dextran molecule contained, on average, 5 copies
of peptide. Inhibition assays were carried out by incubating
3 mmol/L dextran-conjugated peptide and 3 mmol/L Dy550labeled CDD protein with PPC1 cells for 1 hour at 37 C. The
cells were then washed, ﬁxed, and analyzed by confocal microscopy as described earlier.

Tumor tissue penetration ex vivo and in vivo
Protein penetration in tumors was studied ex vivo using fresh
explants of MCF-10CA1a tumors. Excised tumors were cut into
pieces and incubated at 37 C with 20 mmol/L Dy550-labeled
proteins in DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin.
Binding and entry of proteins to the cut surface were examined
by confocal microscopy (Olympus Fluoview 500). In vivo protein
penetration was analyzed using orthotopic MCF-10CA1a tumor
xenografts in mice. Dy550-labeled protein (20 mL of 35 mmol/L
solution; approximately 10 mg protein per tumor) was injected
into the center of tumor (60–80 mm3) with spheroic shape
using 31-gauge needle, and 4 hours later, entire tumors were
dissected and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Five-mm serial
sections from entire tumors were stained with DAPI and
scanned using ScanScope FL 6114 (Aperio Technologies, Inc).
Tumor treatment
Tumor-bearing mice were assigned to 3 treatment groups
approximately 4 weeks after the inoculation of MCF-10CA1a
cells and 9 days after the inoculation of 4T1 cells. The
assignment was based on tumor size to ensure there was
no statistically signiﬁcant difference in tumor volume
among the groups at the time the treatment began. Tumor
volume was calculated from 2 diameter measurements
using a digital vernier caliper and the formula: tumor volume
¼ (length  width2)/2. Proteins were diluted in PBS at
0.3 mg/mL and injected intratumorally. The injected volume
was one third of the tumor volume (0.33 mL of solution per
mm3 of the tumor; ref. 12). The tip of the needle was
advanced to the center of the tumor and the protein solution
was injected over the course of 30 seconds. The injections
were given every 3 days (a total of 4 injections in the MCF10CA1a and 3 in the 4T1 model).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by Student t test, one-way ANOVA, and
two-way ANOVA followed by a suitable post hoc test using
GraphPad Prism 5 software (Graphy Pad Software).

Results
Localization of Bit 1 cell death domain
Forced expression in the cytoplasm of full-length Bit1 has
been shown to induce caspase-independent cell death, whereas the C-terminal catalytic domain lacks this activity (2).
Hence, we focused our analysis on the N-terminal domain. To
identify the CDD, we expressed a panel of N-terminally myctagged Bit1 fragments in HEK 293T cells, because the Nterminal tag prevents mitochondrial localization of Bit1 (2).
Transient transfection of full-length Bit1 and the N-terminal 1
to 62 amino acids (F1-62) caused signiﬁcant cell death, whereas
various shorter fragments from the N-terminal domain showed
lesser or no activity (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2A). The
catalytic Pth2 domain did not induce cell death, but instead
caused a modest increase in cell viability, providing a possible
explanation for the higher activity of F1-62 than full-length Bit1
(Fig. 1). The vector control had no effect on cell viability. On the
basis of these results, we deﬁned the F1-62 fragment as a Bit1
CDD.

Figure 1. N-terminal fragment of Bit1 causes cell death. HEK 293T cells
were transiently transfected with N-terminally myc-tagged Bit1, its Nterminal fragment F1-62, and C-terminal fragment Pth2 using FuGENE6
Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction. The
vector without Bit1 fragment served as a control. The percentage of cell
viability was determined 24 hours posttransfection by MTT assay and
normalized to vector control. Error bars denote mean  SEM of 3
separate experiments carried out in triplicate of each Bit1 fragment
indicated. One-way ANOVA and Student t test were used for statistical
analysis. The comparison shown is to the vector control, or between Bit1
and F1-62.   , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001; ns, not signiﬁcant.

The Bit1 CDD includes a conserved transmembrane segment at residues 14 to 33 (PSTLGLAVGVACGMCLGWSL) in
the human Bit1 sequence (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Deleting
these residues (D14–33) resulted in cytosolic and nuclear
expression, whereas the ﬁrst 13 residues were not required
for the mitochondrial localization (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
These ﬁndings are consistent with the enzymatic Pth2 domain
exposed to the cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2E).
Internalization of CendR-modiﬁed Bit1 CDD protein into
cells
To deliver Bit1 CDD into cells and potentially into their cytoplasm, we fused CDD to a tumor-penetrating peptide iRGD.
For comparison, we also used RPARPAR, a peptide in which the
CendR motif is constitutively active. Bit1 CDD with no CendR
peptide showed negligible binding to PPC1 cells, a cell line that
expresses high levels of NRP-1 (Fig. 2A, a). In contrast, both
RPARPAR-CDD and iRGD-CDD effectively bound to and were
taken up into these cells (Fig. 2A, b and c). CDD and RPARPARCDD did not bind to or internalize into the NRP-1–deﬁcient M21
cells (ref. 11; Fig 2A, d and e). iRGD-CDD bound to the surface
of the M21 cells but was only weakly internalized (Fig. 2A, e),
consistent with M21 cells expressing high levels of the relevant
integrins (13). Cell entry of RPARPAR-CDD was rapid; after
30-minute incubation, the protein was detectable in PPC1 cells,
colocalizing with NRP-1 (Fig. 2B). The amount of internalized
RPARPAR-CDD peaked around 3 hours and much of the protein
was found in perinuclear vesicles. Consistent with the 3-step cell
entry process, internalization of iRGD-CDD was slower than

(CRGEKGPDC), which does not bind to integrins showed no
inhibition of the iRGD-CDD interaction with cells (Fig. 2D).
These controls clearly establish the speciﬁcity of the CendR
peptide-modiﬁed CDDs.
Reduction of cell viability by CendR-modiﬁed CDD
proteins
Treatment of cultured breast cancer cells MCF-10CA1a and
4T1 with iRGD-CDD or RPARPAR-CDD signiﬁcantly reduced
cell viability, whereas nonmodiﬁed CDD protein had a modest
effect at the highest concentrations or no effect at all (Fig. 3A).
RPARPAR-CDD was no more cytotoxic to NRP-1–deﬁcient
M21 cells than unmodiﬁed CDD protein at the highest concentration used (3 mmol/L), indicating that the marginal
toxicity at this concentration was not related to the CendR
targeting. iRGD-CDD decreased M21 cell viability more than
the other 2 CDD proteins, possibly because of integrin-mediated internalization, but the difference to RPARPAR-CDD and
CDD was not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 3A). These results
show that the expression NRP-1, in addition to av integrins, is
needed for the effect of full cytotoxic effect of iRGD-CDD.
Because cells in normal tissues do not express av integrins, and
express lower levels of NRP-1 than most tumors (14), iRGDCDD is expected to selectively accumulate in tumors in vivo.
Histidine has been shown to enhance endosomal escape,
explained in part by a cationic transition at low pH (15–18).

recognition sequence (19), which is positioned in our construct

1356

Cancer Res; 73(4) February 15, 2013

CDD was cleaved and removed using enterokinase and nickelnitrilotriacetic acid afﬁnity chromatography puriﬁcation. The
removal of the his-tag in the resulting iRGD-CDD was conﬁrmed
by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). Cytotoxicity tests in MCF-10CA1a cells
showed that the his-tag effect on construct toxicity was not
signiﬁcant (Fig. 3C). Thus, the his-tag plays only a minor role, if
any, in the endosomal escape of the iRGD-CDD protein.
Penetration of iRGD-CDD into tumor tissue
The iRGD peptide extravasates and penetrates into extravascular tumor tissue when intravenously injected into tumorbearing mice (10). We analyzed the penetration ability of the
CDD proteins by using fresh MCF-10CA1a tumor explants.
CDD showed modest binding to the cut surface of tumor tissue.
iRGD-CDD, however, bound strongly and even penetrated
several cell layers into the tumor tissue (Fig. 4A).
The tumor penetration activity was also apparent when
ﬂuorescently labeled iRGD-CDD was intratumorally injected
into MCF-10CA1a tumors in mice. The strong iRGD-CDD
signal was detectable in all sections from an entire tumor (Fig.
4B). It exhibited a web-like pattern resembling ﬁbrotic stromal
morphology (Fig. 4B, panel 5, inset a). Fibrosis is one of the
major barriers that prevent drug distribution within tumor
tissue. The ability of iRGD to penetrate ﬁbrotic areas in
tumors should help overcome this issue and improve local
chemotherapy. The wide positive areas along the tumor
periphery were presumably caused by outside-in penetration
of iRGD-CDD that overﬂowed during the injection and the
signals were not detectable outside of tumor rim (Fig. 4B,

panel 5, inset b). Sporadic localized iRGD-CDD signals were
detectable throughout the tumor suggesting protein penetration by active transport (Fig. 4B, panel 7, inset). When
CDD was injected, signiﬁcant intratumoral signals were only
present near the injection site (Fig. 4C, panels 3 and 4). The
CDD protein that overﬂowed during the injection remained
outside the tumor rim (Fig. 4C, panels 1–6, and inset), and
showed minimal penetration into the tumor tissue (Fig. 4C).
The total signal of the CDD protein was lower than that of
the iRGD-CDD, possibly because there is no ligand for CDD
protein on tumor cells, allowing the protein to be exported
from the tumor. These data support the notion that iRGD
mediates active tumor penetration of the CDD protein using
the NRP-1–dependent CendR pathway.

Inhibitory effect of iRGD-CDD on tumor growth in mice
Two aggressive breast tumor models MCFA-10CA1a and
4T1 were used for evaluation of antitumor effect by the iRGDCDD protein. Etoposide, a topoisomerase inhibitor that
induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in cancer cells (20), was
capable of activating caspase-3 in 4T1 cells but failed in MCF10CA1a cells, suggesting an impaired caspase cascade signaling in the MCF-10CA1a cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). This lack
of correlation between CDD activity and caspase independence agrees with the previously documented caspase independence of cell death induced by the full length of Bit1
protein.
We next sought to determine whether tumor-targeted Bit1
CDD could be used as a therapeutic agent. We initially

administered iRGD-CDD or CDD intravenously at 10 mg/kg of
mouse body weight every other day. The initial results suggested an antitumor effect by iRGD-CDD that was not seen
with CDD, but symptom of the severe toxicity required euthanasia intervention (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, we turned
our attention to local treatment. The MCF-10CA1a tumors
grew rapidly in mice treated with intratumoral injections of the
PBS or CDD. In the iRGD-CDD treated mice, inhibition of
tumor growth was evident as early as 3 days after the treatment
began. At the end of treatment on day 12, the tumor volume
was reduced by about 77% compared with the PBS and CDD
controls (Fig. 5A). Tumor weights at the end of the experiments
were in agreement with the size measurements; the mean
weight of the tumors in the iRGD-CDD group was 30% of that in
the control groups (Fig. 5B). None of the mice locally treated
with iRGD-CDD or CDD alone showed any body weight loss.
Notably, 2 of 8 mice (25%) in the iRGD-CDD–treated group had
too small tumors to be excised after 12 days of treatment. The

small nodules at the tumor inoculation site in these 2 mice
disappeared during the following several weeks without any
further treatment. No skin abnormalities were observed
around the injection sites, suggesting the tumor-speciﬁc penetration of iRGD-CDD (Fig. 5C). The mice were healthy and had
no signs of tumor metastasis during 6 months of observation.
The treatment results in the 4T1 tumor model were also
positive but reﬂected the greater aggressiveness of these
tumors than the MCF-10CA1a tumors. Tumor volume in
iRGD-CDD group was about 40% and tumor weight about
50% smaller than in the PBS and CDD control groups (Fig. 5D
and E).
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained tumor sections did
not show differences among tumors treated with iRGD-CDD,
CDD, or PBS (Fig. 6A). Tumors from the iRGD-CDD groups,
however, showed signiﬁcantly stronger TUNEL staining than
tumors treated with PBS or CDD, indicating substantial cell
death in the iRGD-CDD–treated tumors (Fig. 6B). In agreement

proliferation was signiﬁcantly lower in the iRGD-CDD–treated
tumors than in the PBS or CDD controls (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
In this work, we deﬁne the Bit1 CDD, localize it to the
presumed membrane-embedded domain of the protein and
show that CDD is more potent than full-length Bit1 in causing
cell death when tested by cDNA transfection. We also show
that the CDD protein is highly active when introduced into
tumor cells using protein transduction mediated by the tumorpenetrating and cell-internalizing peptide iRGD, and that
the fusion protein is a promising antitumor agent capable of
spreading within tumor tissue from an intratumoral injection.

Our results place the CDD of Bit1 in the N-terminal domain,
which contains the 20-amino acid hydrophobic sequence
thought to anchor Bit1 to the mitochondrial outer membrane.
Targeting of polypeptides encoded in the nucleus to
mitochondria requires the presence of a signal sequence for
mitochondrial localization. Most of these sequences contain
positively charged amphipathic a-helical stretch at the Nterminus, followed by a stretch of hydrophobic residues
(21). The Bit1 N-terminus fulﬁlls these criteria (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). The mitochondrial signal sequences can direct a
protein through both of the mitochondrial membranes to the
interior of mitochondria, to the space between the outer and
inner membranes, or anchor a protein to the outer membrane
(22–24). Our results show that Bit1 is available for protease

digestion at the surface of intact mitochondria (Supplementary
Fig. S2D). Thus, Bit1 membrane-embedded domain likely
attaches the protein to the outer mitochondrial membrane
without mediating transfer through the membrane.
Recent results provide clues to the mechanisms underlying
Bit1 and Bit1 CDD-mediated cell death. Bit 1, when translocated to the cytoplasm from the mitochondria, interacts with
the Groucho/TLE family member AES, suggesting that Bit1
may regulate the activities of the antiapoptotic and oncogenic
TLE proteins (2, 6, 25). Other results show that disrupting Bit1
expression with short hairpin RNA confers weakly malignant
MCF7 cells enhanced anoikis resistance and increased migratory potential. These changes correlated with an increase in
active Erk levels and a decrease in Erk-directed phosphatase
activity (26), providing another possible mechanism for the
reduced viability of cells with increased Bit1 activity.
We showed the CDD activity and speciﬁcity using 2 methods, cDNA transfection and protein transduction. As CDD
is thought to act in the cytoplasm and the effects of the protein
transduction and cDNA transfection were similar, we infer
that the CendR peptides delivered CDD into the cytoplasm.
This is the ﬁrst demonstration that peptides using the CendR
pathway can be active in protein transduction.
Traditional cell-penetrating peptides have been used to
deliver recombinant proteins to mammalian cells (27, 28), but
these peptides are nonselective; they promote entry into all
cells. The prototype of these peptides, Tat, resembles our
peptides in that it contains several CendR (R/KXXR/K) motifs
(11). However, Tat is active whether fused to the N- or Cterminus of a protein, whereas the activity of CendR peptides is
position-dependent in that the CendR motif must be exposed
at the C-terminus to be active (11). Hence, activation of
peptides with cryptic CendR motifs in a target tissue can be
used in tissue-speciﬁc delivery of payloads. Indeed, our tumorhoming CendR peptides, such as iRGD and LyP-1 are speciﬁc
for tumors, whereas the Tat-type peptides are not speciﬁc for
any cell type or tissue (10, 29). Thus, the tumor-speciﬁc CendR
peptides offer new opportunities for cell type–speciﬁc and
tissue-speciﬁc protein transduction.
The iRGD peptide selectively activates the CendR transtissue transport pathway in tumor, taking payloads as large as
nanoparticles with it (10, 14, 30, 31). Here, we show that these
peptides can provide a protein with an anticancer activity and
the ability to penetrate into tumor tissue from a local site
without affecting the surrounding normal tissue.
We made use of the tumor penetration activity of iRGD-CDD
in a new anticancer treatment. Treating-tumor bearing mice
with iRGD-CDD effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo,
causing nearly 80% reduction in tumor volume of the MCF10CA1a tumors and 40% reduction in 4T1 tumors. Importantly,
25% of the MCF-10CA1a tumors were eradicated by the iRGDCDD treatment. Targeting caspase independency for tumor

therapeutics is a promising strategy to eliminate cancer cells
because tumor cells often develop resistance to antitumor
agents by developing defects in caspase activation. Activating a
caspase-independent cell death pathway with Bit1 CDD may
be an effective way of attacking tumor cells resistant to
apoptosis. Caspase activation is blocked in the MCF-10CA1a
cells, whereas this pathway is intact in the 4T1 cells. The greater
inhibitory effect of Bit1 CDD in the MCF-10CA1a tumor than in
the 4T1 tumor suggests an inverse correlation between the
activities of the caspase-dependent cell death pathways (32).
Intratumoral treatment may be particularly useful for
tumors that are difﬁcult to remove surgically or treated
systemically. Advanced tumors in vital organs can be unresectable, and some tumors are protected from systemic chemotherapy by the blood–brain barrier and ﬁbrotic stroma.
Indeed, adjuvant local chemotherapy has been applied to
malignant glioma and tested in advanced tumors localizing
in the lungs, pancreas, and esophagus (33–37). However, poor
drug spreading within the tumor tissue has been a limiting
factor for successful local tumor therapies (38, 39). iRGD-CDD,
the novel tumor-penetrating cell death protein, may signiﬁcantly advance local tumor therapies and offer new treatment
options to cancer with locally advanced tumors.
