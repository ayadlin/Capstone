ABSTRACT:
Over the past few years, significant advances have occurred in both our
understanding of the complexity of signal transduction pathways as well as the
isolation of specific inhibitors which target key components in those pathways.
Furthermore critical information is being accrued regarding how genetic mutations
can affect the sensitivity of various types of patients to targeted therapy. Finally,
genetic mechanisms responsible for the development of resistance after targeted
therapy are being discovered which may allow the creation of alternative therapies
to overcome resistance. This review will discuss some of the highlights over the past
few years on the roles of key signaling pathways in various diseases, the targeting
of signal transduction pathways and the genetic mechanisms governing sensitivity
and resistance to targeted therapies.

Mutations Alter the Activity of the Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways.

Novel Targets Interacting with the Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK Pathway.

The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTOR pathways are often activated by mutations within
individual components of these pathways, as well as the
aberrant activation of upstream growth factor receptors.
The genetic basis of sensitivity and resistance to various
small molecule inhibitors which target these pathways as
well a comprehensive list of small molecule inhibitors
as a well as their use in clinical trials have recently been
published [1-7].

Novel upstream Shc regulators such as the multiple
copies in T-cell malignancy 1 (MCT-1) gene have been
recently described which may become an important
therapeutic target as MCT-1 is co-activated with Shc gene
in human carcinomas and knockdown of MCT-1 enhances
apoptotic cell death [14].
The CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 1B
(CKS1B) gene is involved in multiple myeloma (MM).
There is an inverse correlation between CKS1B expression
and survival and it may be a novel therapeutic target
[15]. Recently it was shown that CKS1B activates both
the Raf/MEK/ERK and STAT3 pathways and promotes
drug resistance [16]. Targeting CKS1B may be a novel
approach to treat certain cancers.

Predicting
Inhibitors.

Sensitivity

to

Small

Molecule

Extensive panels of human cell lines have been
examined for mutations in genes implicated in cancer
as well as for their sensitivity to various inhibitors and
chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used to treat cancers
[8,9].
The cell lines were intensively interrogated by
expression profiling, chromosome copy number, deep
sequencing, biostatistical and systems analyses. Both
studies indicated that sensitivity to inhibitors was often
linked with genetic mutations at key elements in the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and some
other pathways. Sensitivity to MEK and Raf inhibitors
was often investigated in these studies. Sensitivity to the
B-Raf inhibitor PLX4720 was highly associated with
particular mutations at BRAF (V600E). Sensitivity to
MEK inhibitors was shown to be associated with BRAF,
NRAS as well as PTEN, PTPN5, SPRY2, DUSP4, DUSP6
mutations and to a lesser extent mutations at KRAS.
Sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in NRAS mutant lines was
linked with aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) expression
[9].
Mutation of BRAF or RAS can contribute to the
pathogenesis of many cancers, including, melanoma and
colo-rectal cancer [10]. BRAF mutations have also been
implicated in the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid cancer
[11].
Mutation of BRAF and KRAS can result in aberrant
c-Myc and SIRT1 protein deacetylase expression in the
colorectal cancer [12]. Mutations at KRAS which result in
increased mutant Ras activity can interact with increased
Wnt expression in lung cancer and lead to a worse
prognosis as the tumors arise at an increased incidence
and tumors which are also larger [13]. Interesting it was
observed that in those tumors where there was increased
KRAS and Wnt activities they had a distinct phenotype
which was similar to embryonic progenitors found in the
developing lung, consistent with the previously described
effects of the Wnt pathway on developmental processes.

Advances in Our Understanding and Targeting of
the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/mTOR
Pathways.
Effective inhibitors specific for many of the key
components of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/MNK, Ras/PI3K/
PTEN/mTOR and other pathways have been developed.
These pathways are often implicated in therapeutic
resistance and interact with many pathways. [17-23].
Ras inhibitors have been examined in many studies
including clinical trials. However the results so far have
not been encouraging. Salirasib (Farnesythiosalycilic acid,
FTS) is a Ras inhibitor. It has recently been demonstrated
that FTS treatment of immuno-competent mice with
subcutaneous or intracranial brain tumors resulted in
a favorable antitumor environment [24]. The authors
observed an increase in regulatory T-cells which altered
the tumor microenviroment and preventing the resistance
of the tumor cells to destruction by the immune system.
BRAF inhibitors have been shown to be effective
in the treatment of melanomas. One of the first described
Raf inhibitors, Sorafenib, has been shown to inhibit
many targets, including VEGFR, PDGFR and Raf. It is
approved for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
where there are few effective therapeutic approaches
[25]. The mechanism of actions of sorafenib have been
further elucidated and it has been determined to alter the
expression of many genes in HCC [26]. A recent genomic
analysis indicated that sorafenib significantly altered
expression levels of 826 and 2011 transcripts in HepG2
and Huh7 cells, respectively. The affected genes whose
expression were upregulated in response to sorafenib
treatment were determined to be involved in angiogenesis,
apoptosis, transcription regulation, signal transduction,
protein biosynthesis and modification, In contrast,
genes which were determined to be downregulated after
sorafenib treatment were involved in cell cycle control,

Rationale for Targeting Multiple Points in Ras/
Raf/MEK ERK Pathway or Multiple Pathways.

DNA replication recombination and repair, cell adhesion,
metabolism and transport. Each sorafenib-treated HCC
cell line displayed specificity in the expression and activity
of crucial factors involved in hepatocarcinogenesis.
The p21-activated protein kinase 1 (PAK1) kinase
also interacts with the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascades. PAK signaling molecules
are downstream effectors of Rho family GTPase and
interact with both Raf and Akt. PAK inhibitors have
been developed [27]. Interestingly, IPA3 inhibits the
proliferation of melanoma and colorectal cancer cells with
mutations at KRAS or NRAS better, than those containing
mutations at BRAF. Treatment of cells with IPA3 or
ectopic expression of DN PAK1 sensitized cell with RAS
mutations to the B-Raf inhibitor GDC-0897 or the MEK
inhibitor ZD6244.
Neurofibromin is a GTP-ase activating protein
(GAP) which is mutated in neurofibromatosis patients and
is considered a tumor suppressor. Neurofibromin normally
can regulate cell motility often via the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
cascade by an interaction of the Ras GTPase-activating
protein-related domain (GRD) present on Neurofibromin.
Neurofibromin can also regulate Rho-dependent (Rasindependent) event by activating LIM kinase 2 (LIMK2).
LIMK2 can phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin (a
key protein involved in actin-depolymerization factor).
Finally, the pre-GRD domain present on Neurofibromin
can interact with Rac1 GTPase, which activate the P21
activated kinase 1 (PAK1)-LIMK1-cofilin pathway.
T56-LIMKi is a novel inhibitor that was isolated by
molecular modeling that suppressed LIMK1/2 kinase
activities which blocked the phosphorylation of cofilin and
disrupted actin structure and prevented effects associated
with tumorigenicity. The combined effect of the Ras
inhibitor Salirasib and T56-LIMKi on cell proliferation
were examined and synergistic effects were observed [28].
The PIM kinases can also interact with the EGFR/
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and certain PIM kinase
inhibitors will induce the MIG6 gene which encodes
a suppressor of EGFR signaling. These PIM specific
inhibitors (M-110 and SGI-1776) suppress ERK activation
in prostate cancer cells. Moreover synergistic effects were
observed when the PIM inhibitors were combined with
the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib. These results indicate that
the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors may be improved by PIM
inhibitors [29].
Ras and other transformed cells often become
addicted to autophagy. Targeting certain Ras-addicted cells
with autophagy inhibitors (chloroquine and the derivative
hydroxychloroquine) may prove to be an effective
therapeutic approach [30].

An emerging concept in cancer therapy is the
targeting of multiple points in a single signaling pathway.
It has been proposed that targeting of both Raf and MEK
or Raf and ERK may be useful in certain cancer therapies
[31]. The concept of targeting both Raf and MEK is
especially true with BRAF inhibitors and melanoma which
contain mutations at BRAFV600E due to the negative
feedback elicited by downstream ERK which suppresses
the sensitivity of the cells to signaling induced by growth
factors and Ras activity is low [32]. In these cells the
mutant BRAF protein functions as a monomer. The Raf
inhibitors suppress the activity of the BRAF monomers
but not dimers. Inhibiting the BRAFV600E protein by the
BRAF inhibitors inhibits the BRAFV600E protein which
suppresses the normal negative ERK-mediated feedback
of this pathway. However, this results in reactivation of
ligand-dependent signal transduction and increased Ras
activity and induces generation of Raf-inhibitor resistant
Raf dimers and activation of MEK and downstream ERK.
Thus combined Raf and MEK inhibitor treatment may
become effective anti-cancer approach. Targeting both
MEK and mTOR is a method to target melanoma which
often have mutations at BRAF and increased activation of
the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathway [33]. The Ras/
Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1 pathways
are regulated by extensive crosstalk, occurring at different
levels. In cancer, transactivation of the alternate pathway
is a frequent “escape” mechanism. Thus combined
inhibition of both pathways may achieve synergistic
antitumor activity. In the M14 melanoma model,
simultaneous inhibition of both MEK and mTORC1
achieved synergistic effects at suboptimal concentrations.

Advances in Targeting Anti-Apoptotic Molecules
which are Regulated by Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathways.
The effects of combining MEK and Bcl-2 inhibitors
on AML cells has been investigated [34]. Anti-apoptotic
proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 are key
therapeutic targets in human cancer. The mechanisms of
actions the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 have been further
elucidated [35]. This Bcl-2 inhibitor suppresses Bcl-2
and Bcl-XL but not Mcl-1. ABT-737 treatment results in
activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade and downstream
Mcl-1 in AML cells. The MEK inhibitor PD0325901
suppresses Mcl-1 expression. Combining PD0325901 with
ABT-737 resulted in synergistic killing of AML-derived
cell lines, primary AML blasts and the CD34+, CD38, CD123+ population which is enriched in progenitor/
stem cells. These studies suggest a novel and effective
therapeutic strategy for patients with AML.
1507

Oncotarget2012;3:123456-1521

Treatment of AML cells with ABT-737 and PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors (BEZ235 or PI-103) resulted in a
synergistic response in AML cells, but importantly not
in normal CD34+ cells [36]. This synergy was shown
to result from inhibition of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and the
effects of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors were shown to be
GSK-3 and Bim dependent. The PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
downregulated Mcl-1 but increased Bim binding to Bcl2/Bcl-XL. Knock-down of GSK-3alpha/beta prevented
Mcl-1 downregulation and decreased apoptosis induced
by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Combining PI3K/Akt/mTOR
inhibitors with BH3-mimetics may be an approach to
treat AML especially in those patients who exhibit Akt
activation [37].

induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
SMAD5, suggesting a novel interplay between Aurora-A
and SMAD5 signaling pathways which may be important
in the development of EMT, stemness and ultimately
tumor progression. Pharmacologic or molecular inhibition
of Aurora-A kinase activity restored a CD24+ epithelial
phenotype. This phenotype was associated with restored
ERalpha expression, down-regulation of HER-2/Neu,
inhibition of EMT and impaired self-renewal ability and
suppression of metastases. Thus mitotic kinase Aurora-A
is a promising therapeutic target to selectively eliminate
highly invasive cancer cells.

Advances in Elucidation of Roles of the PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathway in Oncogenesis.

Advances in Targeting Cancer Initiating Cells.

The PI3K pathway has recently been shown
to be important in c-Myc expression in Burkitt’s
lymphomagenesis in germinal center B cells [40]. The
PI3K pathway is also an emerging target for mantle cell
lymphoma as this cascade is upregulated in this cancer
[41]. Disruption of PTEN and p53 activity specifically in
the thyroid has recently been shown to result in murine
models of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas [42]. These
models could be important for the development of
approaches to target human thyroid carcinomas. The PI3K
pathway is important in many cancer including gliomas
often due to aberrant PTEN expression. Recently it was
show that reduction of PIK3CA or PIK3RA expression
impeded proliferation, migration, and invasion in
glioblastoma multiforme cells [43]. In contrast to PI3Kalpha, PI3K-beta is oncogenic in its WT configuration
if it is overexpressed. PI3K-beta acts like an oncogenic
mutant of PI3K-alpha [44]. PI3K-delta has been shown
to have roles in BCR-ABL-mediated chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) by suppressing BCR signaling [45].
Elevated PI3K signaling has been detected in certain
breast cancer subtypes and is believed to drive their
abnormal proliferation [46]. Novel lipid phosphatases
have been shown to be important in regulation of this
pathway. Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II
(INPP4B), is tumor suppressor in implicated in many
cancers such as prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers
and also potentially in leukemia [47]. Akt has recently
been shown to be an important molecule in regulation
of homologous recombination and genetic stability in
hereditary and sporadic breast cancers [48].

The
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK,
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTOR, Wnt/beta-catenin, Notch, Hedgehog and other
pathways are being shown to play key roles in cancer
initiating cells (CICs) and leukemia initiating cells (LIC).
Deregulated expression of oncogenes such as Raf-1
have been associated with drug resistance, epithelial to
mesenchymal transition and CIC survival [38]. Following
metastatic dissemination, cancer cells often re-activate
certain epithelial properties through mesenchymal to
epithelial transition (MET) to establish neoplastic lesions
at secondary sites. The molecular mechanisms regulating
MET remain elusive. Recently MET has been examined in
estrogen-receptor alpha positive (ERalpha+) MCF-7 breast
cancer cells which overexpress activated Raf-1 and are
more resistant to the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin
than parental MCF-7 cells. Constitutive expression of
activated Raf-1 induced HER-2/Neu overexpression and
lead to distant metastases in xenografts. The development
of distant metastases in xenograft models was linked to
activation of the MET pathway as the cells expressed
reduced expression of EMT inducer genes (TGFB2,
TWIST1 and FOXC1) and overexpression of BMB7,
CXCR7 and early growth response (EGR) family of
transcription factors.
The mitotic kinase Aurora-A promotes metastases
by inducing EMT transition in ERalpha+ MCF-7 breast
cancer cells which expressed constitutively-active Raf1 [39]. Constitutive expression of activated Raf-1 in
MCF-7 cells induced stabilization and accumulation
of Aurora-A mitotic kinase. This drove the transition
from an epithelial to a highly invasive mesenchymal
phenotype. This transition resulted in reduced expression
of ERalpha, HER-2/Neu over-expression, and loss
of CD24 surface receptor (CD24-/low). Importantly,
expression of key EMT markers and upregulation of the
stemness gene SOX2 was linked to acquisition of stem
cell-like properties. The cells had an increased ability to
form mammospheres in vitro and tumor self-renewal in
vivo. Moreover, the aberrant Aurora-A kinase activity

Advances in Targeting the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTOR Pathway.
The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway is also
involved in drug resistance, sensitivity to therapy and
metastasis [49-58]. PIK3CA mutations may act as driver
mutations in certain cancers responsible for metastasis
1508

Oncotarget2012;3:123456-1521

[59]. Novel PI3K-alpha inhibitors have been isolated and
they inhibit metastasis [60]. Most PI3K inhibitors are
cytostatic rather than cytotoxic and it has been questioned
whether treatment with a single PI3K inhibitor will be
effective [61].
There have been many recent advances in the
development of inhibitors which target this pathway. One
of the key developments is in dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia proliferates, in part, in
response to aberrant PI3K/Akt activity. The dual PI3K/
Akt inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 suppresses the growth of the
Waldenstrom’s anemia cells as well as has effects on the
tumor microenvironment [62].
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling network is activated
in acute leukemias of both myelogenous and lymphoid
lineage, where it correlates with poor prognosis and
enhanced drug-resistance. Treatment of AML and ALL
with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors has been shown to be
more effective than treatment with rapamycin which
blocks mTORC1 but not mTORC2 [63]. The dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors suppressed the rapamycin-resistant
phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding
protein 1. The novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVPBEZ235, an orally bioavailable imidazoquinoline
derivative, has entered clinical trials. Moreover in
both T-ALL cell lines and patient samples. NVPBEZ235 was cytotoxic to a panel of T-ALL cell lines as
determined by MTT assays. NVP-BEZ235 induced cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis. A dose- and time-dependent
dephosphorylation of Akt and mTORC1 downstream
targets was observed after NVP-BEZ235 treatment.
NVP-BEZ235 targeted the side population of both T-ALL
cell lines and patient lymphoblasts, which is enriched
in leukemia initiating cells (LIC), and synergized with
chemotherapeutic agents (cyclophosphamide, cytarabine,
dexamethasone) which are used currently for treating
T-ALL patients. NVP-BEZ235 reduced chemoresistance
to vincristine induced in Jurkat T cells upon coculturing
with MS-5 stromal cells, which mimics the bone marrow
microenvironment. NVP-BEZ235 was cytotoxic to T-ALL
patient lymphoblasts displaying pathway activation, where
the drug dephosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor
4E-binding protein 1, in contrast rapamycin did not elicit
such changes. Longitudinal inhibition at two nodes of
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR network with NVP-BEZ235, either
alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs,
may be an efficient treatment of those T-ALLs that have
aberrant upregulation of this signaling pathway for their
proliferation and survival [64].
The dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235
has also been shown recently to synergize with a panhistone deacetylase inhibitor in suppressing the growth of
pancreatic cancer [65].
Effective Akt inhibitors have been recently
developed. The Akt inhibitor MK-2206 has been shown
to be effective in suppressing the growth of many cancers
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

including leukemias. This Akt inhibitor is currently in
many clinical trials with cancer patients have diverse
diseases either as a single or combined agent with an
additional signal transduction inhibitor or chemo- or
endocrine therapy [65]. The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1
pathway is frequently upregulated in T-ALL, The effects
of the novel allosteric Akt inhibitor, MK-2206, on a panel
of human T-ALL cell lines and primary cells from T-ALL
patients were examined. MK-2206 decreased cell viability
by blocking leukemic cells in G0/G1 and induced apoptosis
as well as autophagy and a concentration-dependent
dephosphorylation of Akt and its downstream targets,
GSK-3alpha/beta and FOXO3A. MK-2206 was cytotoxic
to primary T-ALL cells and importantly induced apoptosis
in the T-ALL patient cell subset (CD34+, CD4-, CD7-),
which are enriched in LICs. Akt inhibition may represent
a potential therapeutic strategy in T-ALL.
Alkylphospholipids and alkylphosphocholines
(APCs) are promising antitumor agents, which target
the plasma membrane and affect multiple signal
transduction networks including Akt. The therapeutic
potential of erucylphosphohomocholine (ErPC3), the first
intravenously applicable APC, on human AML cells was
determined. At short (6-12 h) incubation times, ErPC3
blocked cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle, whereas,
at longer incubation times, it decreased survival and
induced apoptotic cell death. ErPC3 induced JNK 1/2
activation while stimulating ERK 1/2 dephosphorylation.
Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-3 or a JNK 1/2
inhibitor peptide reduced ErPC3 cytotoxicity. Protein
phosphatase 2A downregulation by siRNA inhibited ERK
1/2 dephosphorylation and blunted the cytotoxic effects of
ErPC3. ErPC3 was also cytotoxic to AML primary cells
and importantly reduced the clonogenic activity of CD34+
leukemic cells. ErPC3 treatment induced apoptosis in the
(CD34+ , CD38(Low/-), CD123+) compartment which is
enriched in putative LICs. ErPC3 induced cytotoxicity
on AML blasts which expressed high levels of aldehyde
dehydrogenase activity and on the side population of
AML cell lines and blasts in which the LIC populations
are believed to reside. Thus ErPC3 might be a promising
therapeutic agent for the treatment of AML patients [66].

Advances in Understanding the Pleiotropic
Effects of mTOR.
The importance of mTOR and its inhibition in
various conditions, including cancer, diabetes, aging and
others has been further elucidated. Recently mTOR has
been shown to be cell cycle regulated [67,68]. mTOR has
been referred to as the gatekeeper of autophagy. mTOR
plays important roles in many biological processes,
including; autophagy [69] energy control [70-72],
insulin resistance [73], diabetes [74,75], seizures [76,77],
protein homeostasis [78], regulation of tRNA expression
1509

[79,80], cell cycle arrest [81], cell differentiation [82,83],
cell migration [84,85], follicle development [86],
DNA damage checkpoint [87], DNA replication stress
[88],cellular quiescence/senescence [89-107] progeria
[108], age-related retinal diseases [109], obesity [110],
stem cells [111], cancer [112,113] , aging [114-134],
Alzheimer’s disease [135] and Parkinson’s disease [136].
mTORC1 is a critical repressor of autophagy, a
lysosome-dependent degradation pathway which allows
cells to recycle damaged or unnecessary cytoplasmic
content, such as lipids, proteins, and organelles [138-156].
As a consequence, cells produce metabolic precursors for
macromolecular biosynthesis or ATP generation. In cancer
cells, autophagy fulfills a dual role, as it has both tumorpromoting and tumor-suppressing properties. Functional
autophagy prevents necrosis and inflammation, which
can lead to genetic instability. However, autophagy is
important for tumor progression by providing energy
through its recycling mechanism during unfavorable
metabolic circumstances, which frequently occurs in
certain tumors [138-156].
A model was proposed recently by Dr. Michael
P. Lisanti and colleagues which is called the reverse
Warburg Effect. This model proposes that the aerobic
glycolysis occurring in the tumor associated fibroblasts
and not in the actual epithelial tumor cells [142,146-150].
This results in the transfer of high-energy metabolites
(lactate and pyruvate) to adjacent epithelial cancer cells
which fuel the cancer cells allowing them to invade and
metastasize. In addition, oxidative stress generated by the
cancer cells induces autophagy of the tumor associated
fibroblasts which the cancer cells then recycle and use
to fuel their growth. Anti-oxidants (N-acetyl cysteine,
NAC), quercetin and the anti-diabetes drug metformin)
or autophagy inhibitors (chloroquine) will suppress
the destruction of caveolin-1 in stromal fibroblasts and
inhibit cancer growth. Caveolin-1 is a key protein at the
cell membrane which serves to organize other important
signaling molecules into signaling complexes (e.g., Fak,
Src). Decreased expression of caveolin-1 is associated
with a poorer prognosis of breast and other cancers.
Autophagy is also important in blood cancers
[151-153]. Autophagy can be regulated by epigenetic
mechanisms [154]. Autophagy may also become defective
in certain drug resistant cells [155]. Defective autophagy
may be controlled by the p53 rheostat in cancer [156].
Clearly autophagy is a very important survival process
which is regulated in part by mTORC1.
The mTORC1 blocker rapamycin may be useful in
the treatment of many diseases including HIV and HCV
infections [157,158].

mTOR is present in two complexes, mTORC1 and
mTORC2. Both of these complexes play critical roles
in signal transduction pathways and regulate cell growth
and many other physiological processes. Rapamycin
and rapalogs only inhibit (block) mTORC1. Allosteric
inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin had only modest
effects in T-ALL. ATP-competitive inhibitors specific for
the mTOR kinase active site have been developed recently.
The therapeutic potential of active-site mTOR inhibitors
in suppressing growth in T-ALL cell lines and primary
samples from T-ALL patients which had activation of
mTORC1 and mTORC2 was examined. The inhibitors
affected T-ALL cell viability by inducing G0/G1 cell cycle
arrest, apoptosis and autophagy. Decreased levels of
the mTORC2 target Ser 473 Akt were detected as well
as dephosphorylation of mTORC1 downstream targets.
Unlike rapamycin, marked inhibition of mRNA translation
in T-ALL cell lines treated was observed with active-site
mTOR inhibitors. The mTOR inhibitors synergized with
both vincristine and the Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT-263. The
mTOR inhibitors targeted a putative LIC sub-population
(CD34+, CD7-, CD4-) in the ALL patient samples. The
mTOR inhibitors displayed remarkable anti-leukemic
activity, and could become clinical candidates for T-ALL
therapy [160].

Advances in Targeting the NF-kappaB Pathway.
Targeting the NF-kappaB pathway has been shown
to be a potential therapeutic approach in leukemia and
other therapies. The NF-kappaB pathway is regulated in
part by PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway. The IkappaB
kinase (IKK)/NF-kappaB axis is required for viability of
leukemic cells and is a predictor of relapse in T-ALL. It
turns out that many anticancer agents induce NF-kappaB
nuclear translocation. This results in activation of NFkappaB target genes, which can alter the sensitivity to
chemotherapeutic drugs. The I-kappaB kinase inhibitor
is the target of BMS-345541 [161]. The anti-proliferative
effects of BMS-345541 in three Notch1-mutated T-ALL
cell lines and in T-ALL primary cells from pediatric
patients were investigated. BMS-345541 induced
apoptosis and accumulation of cells in the G 2/M phase
of the cell cycle. T-ALL cells treated with BMS-345541
displayed nuclear translocation of FOXO3a as well as
downstream p21Cip1 expression. FOXO3a subcellular
re-distribution was independent of AKT and ERK 1/2
signaling, suggesting that in T-ALL, the loss of FOXO3a
tumor suppressor function could be due to deregulation
of IKK. FOXO3a mutations are not frequently found in
human tumors. Thus therapeutics activating FOXO3a may
be more effective than others. BMS-345541 could be used
alone or in combination with traditional therapies in the
treatment of T-ALL.

apoptosis through reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production in hepatoma cells. Cox-2 inhibition is an
additional approach to inhibit hepatoma cell growth [163].
Celecoxib can also synergize with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 and suppress the growth of hepatocellular
carcinoma [164]. Subsequently DHMEQ was determined
to synergize with the Cox-2 inhibitor celecoxib in
hepatoma cells, again via a ROS-dependent mechanism
[165]. DHMEQ cooperated with celecoxib (CLX) to
decrease NF-kappaB DNA binding and inhibited cell
proliferation more effectively than treatment with these
single agents alone. DHMEQ-CLX combination resulted
in ROS production which in turn induced the expression
of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.
Silencing TRB3 mRNA, which is associated with ER
stress, significantly decreased DHMEQ-CLX-induced
cell growth inhibition. The DHMEQ-CLX combined
treatment was associated with induction of PARP cleavage
and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2,
Mcl-1 and survivin, as well as activated Akt. CD95 and
CD95 ligand expression increased synergistically in the
combined treatment, which was reversed in the presence
of NAC. Knockdown of CD95 mRNA expression
decreased DHMEQ-CLX-induced growth inhibition in
HCC cell lines. Thus the DHMEQ-CLX combination
killed hepatoma cells via ROS production, ER stress
response and the activation of intrinsic and extrinsic
apoptotic pathways.

inhibitor (KU63794).
Often signal transduction inhibitors are cytostatic
as opposed to cytotoxic. This is especially true with
rapamycin. The effects of combining targeted therapy
with chemotherapy is an emerging concept and is also
being examined by clinical trials [169]. The therapeutic
potential of a combination of temsirolimus [an allosteric
mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibitor] with clofarabine,
a nucleoside analogue with potent inhibitory effects on
both ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase was
examined in AML cell lines and clinical specimens. The
drug combination (CLO-TOR) displayed synergistic
cytotoxic effects against a panel of AML cell lines and
in primary cells from AML patients. The CLO-TOR
treatment induced arrest at the G0/G1 phase of the cell
cycle, apoptosis, and autophagy. CLO-TOR combination
was pro-apoptotic in an AML patient blast subset (CD34+,
CD38-, CD123+), which is enriched in putative LICs. The
CLO-TOR combination could represent a novel valuable
treatment for AML patients, also in light of its efficacy
against LICs.

Activation of Liver Kinase B1/AMP Activated
Protein Kinase Pathway as an Anti-Cancer
Therapy.
The liver kinase B1/AMP activated protein kinase
(LMPK) pathway has been determined to be a key
pathway in metabolism (diabetes) as well as cancer and
other diseases [170]. The LKB1/AMPK network remains
functional in a wide range of cancers and can be stimulated
by drugs, such as N,N-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic
diamide (metformin) or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR). LKB1/AMPK signaling
induces cell cycle arrest, caspase-dependent apoptosis
or autophagy in various tumors. Metformin inhibits
mTORC1-controlled oncogenetic protein translation,
which does not occur with allosteric mTORC1 inhibitors,
such as rapamycin and its derivatives. Metformin also
targets LICs and CICs, the critical target for leukemia
eradication. Thus the LKB1/AMPK pathway is critically
involved in regulating proliferation and survival of
malignant cells. Drugs activating LKB1/AMPK may be
both a novel and less toxic treatment option for certain
malignancies [171-174].
The effects of metformin against T-ALL cell
lines and primary samples from T-ALL patients
displaying mTORC1 activation. Metformin inhibited
T-ALL cell viability by inducing autophagy and
apoptosis. Importantly, it was much less toxic against
proliferating CD4+ T-lymphocytes from healthy donors.
Dephosphorylation of downstream targets of mTORC1
were detected. A marked inhibition of mRNA translation
in T-ALL cells treated with metformin, in contrast such an
inhibition of translation was not observed after rapamycin

Advances in Targeting Multiple Points in PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway.
An emerging concept in cancer therapy is the
targeting of multiple points in the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
and other pathways. The expression of the PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTOR pathway is often upregulated in melanomas.
The dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 inhibited
melanoma growth regardless of BRAF mutation status.
Rapamycin enhanced the activity of the dual PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 in inhibiting the growth
of melanoma [166]. Furthermore addition of the MEK
inhibitor AZD6244 synergized with the dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 in suppressing melanoma growth.
The effects of targeting different levels of the PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway has also been examined in
various leukemias [167]. The efficacy of co-targeting
of different components of the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
pathway with a novel dual PI3K/Akt inhibitor has been
investigated in T-ALL. [168]. The dual PI3K/PDK1
inhibitor NVP-BAG956 was determined in one study to
exert the most powerful cytotoxic affects against T-ALL
cell lines and primary patients samples, in comparison
to a pan class I PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941), an allosteric
Akt inhibitor (MK-2206), an mTORC1 allosteric inhibitor
(RAD-001), or an ATP-competitive mTORC1/mTORC2

treated. Remarkably, metformin targeted the side
population of T-ALL cell lines as well as a putative LIC
subpopulation (CD34+, CD7-, CD4-) in primary patient
samples. Metformin displayed a remarkable anti-leukemic
activity, which emphasizes future development of LKB1/
AMPK activators as clinical candidates for therapy of
T-ALL [175]. AMPK has also been shown to be important
in BCR-ABL-induced CML and AMPK activators may
prove useful as supplemental drugs for this disease [176].
AMPK can also be activated by rapamycin [177].
The plant natural product berberine has recently
been shown to inhibit the growth of drug resistant breast
cancer cells whereas the parental drug sensitive line
was not as growth inhibited [178]. Berberine may also
target LKB1/AMPK. Breast cancer cells overexpressing
neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) were
more sensitive to berberine than parental cells which did
not over express NGAL [178].

p53 has also been shown to be a target for lowering
associated toxicity of normal cells after chemotherapy.
The protection of normal cells from cell cycle-specific
chemotherapeutic agents such as mitotic inhibitors (MI)
was examined after a 3-day exposure to MI (paclitaxel and
nocodazole) by colony formation. In three normal human
cell types with WT-p53 (RPE, NKE, WI-38t cells) but
not in cancer cells with mutant p53, pre-treatment with
Nutlin-3a, caused G1 and/or G2 arrest, thus preventing
lethal mitotic arrest normally induced by MIs and
allowing normal cells to recover after removal of the MIs.
Rapamycin potentiated the protective effects of Nutlin-3a
in the p53-WT cells. Also, a combination of rapamycin
and metformin, induced G1 and G2 arrest selectively in
p53-WT cells and thereby protected them from the MIs. A
combination of metformin and rapamycin also protected
p53-WT cells in low glucose conditions, whereas it was
cytotoxic for p53 mutant cells. A rational combination of
metformin and rapamycin may potentiate chemotherapy
with MIs, while protecting normal cells thus therapyinduced toxicities [180-181].

Advances in Understanding the p53 Pathway and
Targeting.

Advances in Roles of Androgen Receptor, BetaCatenin, and Akt in Androgen Responsiveness of
Prostate Cancer.

Both the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK pathways can interact with the p53 pathway at
various levels. Functional p53 gene status was determined
to be important in the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells
to chemotherapeutic drugs, radiation treatment and the
small molecule MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin 3A. [179]. The
p53 transcription factor is a critical element in the ability
of the cell to regulate the cell cycle and its response to
DNA damage. Mutations within the DNA-binding
domain of p53 are common in human cancers and allow
the formation of tetramers; however, these alterations
prevent this protein complex from associating with
appropriate target gene promoters. The effects of p53
functionality in prostate cancer cells that harbored WT
or mutant forms of the protein in response to commonly
used chemotherapeutic drugs were examined. The
androgen receptor positive 22Rv-1 and LNCaP prostate
cancer cell lines carry WT p53 and were demonstrated
to have a decrease in chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity
when transfected with a dominant-negative (DN) p53
gene. Conversely, expression of a WT p53 gene in the
p53-mutated and more advanced DU145 prostate cancer
cell line significantly increased its overall sensitivity to
anti-neoplastic drugs. Analysis of colony formation in
soft agar revealed that the functional status of p53 in each
cell line altered the ability to proliferate in an anchorageindependent fashion. Prostate cancer colony growth
was more prevalent when p53 transcriptional activity
was decreased, whereas growth was more limited in the
presence of functional p53. Thus the functional status of
the tumor suppressor p53 is important in the progression
of prostate cancer and dictates the overall effectiveness a
given drug would have on disease treatment.

The effects of silencing androgen receptor (AR),
beta-catenin and Akt expression in prostate cancer growth
and migration were examined [182]. The mechanisms
responsible for the conversion of prostate cancer from
androgen-sensitive (AS) to androgen-insensitive (AI) are
not well understood. AR signaling involves cross-talk
with the other signaling pathways, and other proteins,
such as beta-catenin. To further elucidate some of the
biochemical changes that occur during the switch from
AS to AI form, AR, Akt and β-catenin expression were
knocked-down with respective siRNAs. Treatment of AR+
LNCaP prostate cells with siRNA for AR significantly
reduced proliferation (45-70%), expression of nuclear
β-catenin, cyclin-D1, cyclin-G1, c-Myc as well as
activity of metalloproteinases (MMPs) -2,-7,-9 and cell
migration. After longer periods of AR silencing (over 72
hrs) in LNCaP cells, elevated levels of activated Akt were
detected and enhanced proliferation as well as expression
of nuclear beta-catenin, cyclin-D1, c-Myc and activity of
MMPs were observed. Such effects were not observed in
either AI, AR-, PC-3 or DU145 cells. However, silencing
of Akt and /or beta-catenin in those as well as in AS, AR+
LNCaP cells led to decreased proliferation and migration.
These studies indicate that either AR or Akt signaling
prevails, depending on their initial androgen sensitivity
as well as its availability. In AI prostate cancer cells, Akt
takes over the role of AR and more effectively contributes
through the same signaling molecule, beta-catenin, to
AI cancer progression. Thus Akt can be a key target in

bacterial siderophores and preventing bacterial iron
sequestration to roles in cancer invasion, EMT, and
metastasis [187]. NGAL is believed to play roles in
promoting survival, growth, invasion and metastasis.
In addition NGAL may also have roles in sequestration
of iron resulting in cell survival and tumorigeneis.
Upregulated NGAL expression in often upregulated in
advanced tumors and is easily detected in urine. Clearly
NGAL may represent an important marker for certain
cancers.
Recently the role of NGAL in sensitivity to targeted
therapy has been investigated in breast cancer cells.
Ecotopic expression of NGAL does not increase the
resistance of cancer cells to doxorubicin [188]. In contrast,
ectopic expression of NGAL did alter the sensitivity of
MCF-7 breast cancer cells to targeted therapy [178]
MCF-7/NGAL were more sensitive to EGFR, Bcl-2
and calmodulin kinase inhibitors as well as the natural
plant product berberine than MCF-7 cells infected with
the empty retroviral vector pLXSN. These results are
important as the expression of NGAL is often detected at
elevated levels after chemotherapy [189]. Furthermore the
expression of NGAL increases in more advanced cancers.

Advances in NO-Modified Drugs and Inhibitors.
Recently the effect on nitric oxide (NO)-modified
inhibitors and drugs has been examined in various
cancer settings [183-185]. The NO-modified form of
HIV protease inhibitor Saquinavir (Saq) is a potent
antitumoral agent efficient against numerous tumor cell
lines in vitro and in vivo. Saq-NO was determined to
sensitize certain types of cells to tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated cell
death. Saq-NO inhibited both the growth of LNCaP cells
in vitro and in xenograft models. Suppression of tumor
growth was accompanied with cell cycle arrest in G0/G1
phase. Permanent abrogation of S6 phosphorylation was
observed. Diminished S6 phosphorylation was associated
with re-established sensitivity to TRAIL and reduction
of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). NO
modification of Saq led to a new chemical entity with
stronger and more pleiotropic antitumor activity than the
parental drug.
The effects of the NO-modified anti-inflammatory
drug (S,R)-3-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxasole acetic acid
(VGX-1027) named GIT-27NO or the NO-modified
antiviral drug saquinavir (Saq) named Saq-NO were
examined on colon cancer cell lines, murine CT26CL25
and human HCT116. Both agents suppressed the growth
of colon cancer cells in vitro. The efficacy of the drugs
was evaluated in vivo in BALB/c mice injected with
CT26CL25 cells. Both agents suppressed reduced
tumor volume in syngeneic BALB/c mice. However,
their mechanisms of action were different as GIT-27NO
released larger amounts of nitrite than Saq-NO in vitro
and its antitumor action depended on the intracellular
NO release. In contrast, Saq-NO released barely
detectable amounts of NO and its antitumor action was
NO-independent. Cotreatment with an NO-peroxynitrite
scavenger revealed that GIT-27NO but not Saq-NO
acts through peroxynitrite-mediated cell destruction.
GIT-27NO predominately induced proapoptotic signals
followed by caspase-dependent apoptosis. While SaqNO blocked cell proliferation, changed their adhesive,
migratory, and invasive properties, and decreased their
metastatic potential in vivo. In conclusion, differences in
NO release and oxidative stress generation between GIT27NO and Saq-NO resulted in different mechanisms that
resulted in cell death [186].

SUMMARY
In this review, we have discussed some of the
recent advances in targeting certain signal transduction
pathways. Although there have been many advances in
our understanding of other key pathways involved in
cancer such as Wnt/beta-catenin [190], Notch [191] and
hedgehog [192], we have primarily focused on the Ras/
Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways due
to space considerations. Clearly as we learn more about
these pathways, we find that they have not only complex
interactions with other pathways, but the importance of
genetics and biochemistry in the sensitivity and resistance
to targeted therapy. Further elucidation of these and other
signaling pathways may allow more effective therapies to
be developed for cancer and other diseases.
