SUMMARY
Multiple somatic rearrangements are often found in cancer genomes. However, the underlying
processes of rearrangement and their contribution to cancer development are poorly characterised.
Here, we employed a paired-end sequencing strategy to identify somatic rearrangements in breast
cancer genomes. There are more rearrangements in some breast cancers than previously
appreciated. Rearrangements are more frequent over gene footprints and most are
intrachromosomal. Multiple architectures of rearrangement are present, but tandem duplications
are common in some cancers, perhaps reflecting a specific defect in DNA maintenance. Short
overlapping sequences at most rearrangement junctions suggest that these have been mediated by
non-homologous end-joining DNA repair, although varying sequence patterns indicate that
multiple processes of this type are operative. Several expressed in-frame fusion genes were
identified but none were recurrent. The study provides a new perspective on cancer genomes,
highlighting the diversity of somatic rearrangements and their potential contribution to cancer
development.

INTRODUCTION

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cytogenetic studies over several decades have shown that somatic rearrangements, in
particular chromosomal translocations, occur in many human cancer genomes1-3. The
prevalence of rearrangements is, however, variable with some cancer genomes exhibiting
few and others, including the genomes of many common adult epithelial cancers, showing
many.
Somatic rearrangement is a common mechanism for the conversion of normal genes into
cancer genes1-5. Indeed, of the ~400 genes that are currently known to be somatically
mutated and implicated in cancer development, most are altered by genomic rearrangement
(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/). These rearrangements usually result in the
formation of a fusion gene, derived from two disrupted normal genes, from which a fusion
transcript and protein is generated. In some instances, however, rearrangements place an
intact gene under the control of new regulatory elements or cause internal reorganisation of
a gene. These events usually result in activation of the protein to contribute to oncogenesis,
as in the paradigm of the BCR-ABL fusion gene in chronic myeloid leukaemia6.
Most of the currently known fusion genes are operative in leukaemias, lymphomas and
sarcomas1,3 although similar cancer-causing rearrangements in RET, NTRK1, NTRK3,
BRAF and TFE3 were reported in rare epithelial cancers many years ago (http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/). Activated fusion genes in common adult
epithelial cancers such as those of the ETS transcription factor family in prostate cancer7
and the ALK gene in lung adenocarcinoma8 were discovered only recently and not through
the conventional strategy of positional cloning of cytogenetically ascertained chromosomal
breakpoints. Their late emergence primarily reflects the complexity of cytogenetically
visible rearrangement patterns in the genomes of many adult epithelial cancers and the
consequent difficulty in prior selection of driver rearrangements for further study among the
many likely passenger changes9. Rearrangements also constitute a subset of mutational
events that result in inactivation of recessive cancer genes (tumour suppressor genes) and
underlie genomic amplifications that result in increased copy number of cancer genes10-12.

In recent years, the diversity of prevalence and pattern of point mutations and copy number
changes in cancer genomes have been elucidated by systematic PCR-based resequencing
studies and by application of high resolution copy number arrays respectively13-16.
Understanding of the basic patterns of rearrangement in most cancers, however, remains
rudimentary. We recently demonstrated that second generation sequencing of both ends of
large numbers of DNA fragments generated from cancer genomes allows comprehensive
characterisation of rearrangements17. Here we apply this approach to a series of breast
cancers to explore patterns of rearrangement and their potential contribution to cancer
development.

RESULTS
Landscapes of rearrangement
Twenty four breast cancers were investigated by sequencing both ends of ~65,000,000
randomly generated ~500bp DNA fragments from each cancer on Illumina GAII Genome
Analysers (Supplementary Figure 1). The series included primary tumours and immortal
cancer cell lines, examples of the commonest phenotypically defined subtypes and cases
with high risk germline predisposition mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53 (Table 1).
Rearrangements were initially identified as discordant paired-end reads which did not map
back to the reference human genome in the correct orientation with respect to each other

and/or within ~500bp of each other. These were subsequently confirmed and evaluated for
somatic or germline origin.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

2,166 confirmed somatic rearrangements were identified among the 24 cancers
(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The presence of multiple read pairs spanning each
rearrangement (Supplementary Table 1), easily detectable copy number changes associated
with many and targeted FISH studies on a subset indicate that most rearrangements are in
cells of the dominant cancer clone and not in minority cell populations. By investigating
whether rearrangements were found for 200 changes in genomic copy number, we estimate
that ~50% rearrangements have been detected.
Some cancers carried many rearrangements. For example the breast cancer cell line HCC38
has at least 238 (Figure 1), many more than could have been predicted from cytogenetic
studies (http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/~pawefish/BreastCellLineDescriptions/HCC38.html).
However, there is substantial variation in prevalence, with some primary breast cancers
carrying only a single rearrangement (Figure 1, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2,
Supplementary Figure 2). Overall, breast cancer cell lines showed more rearrangements
(median 101, range 58-245) than primary cancers (median 38, range 1-231). This difference
may be due to the acquisition of additional rearrangements during in vitro culture. However,
it may also reflect less sensitive detection of rearrangements in primary cancers due to
contaminating normal tissue or the relative propensity of some subclasses of breast cancer,
for example metastases generating pleural effusions, to become established in culture. In
some cancers rearrangements are evenly distributed through the genome. By contrast, in
others they cluster in and connect genomic regions showing amplification. The
rearrangement architecture in such amplicons is often highly complex10,11.
Architectures of rearrangement

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The orientations and relative chromosomal locations of the two genomic segments forming
each rearrangement can be used as the basis of a rearrangement classification system. This
may be further elaborated using information from copy number and other analyses that
allow reconstruction of the genomic architecture associated with each rearrangement. For
the purposes of this report, we have derived a simplified version of this system, classifying
each rearrangement according to a) whether it is in an amplicon or not, b) if not in an
amplicon whether it is interchromosomal or intrachromosomal and c) if intrachromosomal
whether it results in a deletion, tandem duplication, or rearrangement of inverted orientation
(Figure 1b).
There were 1,311 intrachromosomal and 239 interchromosomal rearrangements (excluding
rearrangements within amplicons of which 397 were intrachromosomal compared to 219
interchromosomal) (Table 2, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Thus intrachromosomal
rearrangements substantially outnumber interchromosomal rearrangements in breast cancer
genomes. The breakpoints of 1574 out of 1708 intrachromosomal rearrangements were
within 2Mb of each other. These patterns are presumably attributable to the greater
likelihood of physical interaction between two positions on the same chromosome compared
to positions on different chromosomes, perhaps due to individual chromosomes occupying
domains in the nucleus, and between two locations that are in close proximity on the same
chromosome. The predominance of intrachromosomal rearrangements has not previously
been appreciated because of the limited resolution of cytogenetic studies and because FISH
based approaches, such as spectral karyotyping, generally employ a single fluorescence
colour per chromosome.
The most commonly observed architecture of rearrangement was tandem duplication (there
were 739 tandem duplications, 357 deletions and 215 rearrangements with inverted

orientation, Table 2, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The evidence that these are truly
tandem insertions derives from the structure of the genomic rearrangement itself supported
by cDNA and FISH studies (Tables 3 and 4, Supplementary Figures 3 and 4). The
duplicated segments ranged in size from 3kb to greater than 1Mb (Supplementary Table 1).
Despite being the commonest class of rearrangement in breast cancer, tandem duplications
have previously been overlooked because they are intrachromosomal and involve small
chromosomal segments beyond the resolution of cytogenetics or previous generations of
copy number arrays.
There were major differences between individual breast cancers in the number of tandem
duplications (Figure 1b, Supplementary Figure 5). Some exhibited more than one hundred
while others showed few or none. The mechanistic basis for these differences is unknown,
but may be due to a defective DNA maintenance process which confers a “mutator
phenotype”. This would be similar, in principle, to the defects in DNA mismatch repair that
are responsible for microsatellite instability in some cancers. This putative mutator
phenotype is unlikely to be directly related to deficiencies in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mediated
DNA repair as some cancers arising in individuals with germline mutations in these genes
have few tandem duplications. Large numbers of tandem duplications were generally
observed, however, in cancers that do not express estrogen and progesterone receptors.
Sequences at rearrangement junctions
DNA sequence across the rearrangement junction was obtained from 1,821 (3,642
breakpoints) of the 2,166 confirmed rearrangements (Supplementary Table 3). The
sequences 100bp either side of each breakpoint were examined for the presence of motifs
and sequence content. No striking signatures were observed, although there was a slight
deficit of C:G base pairs compared to the genome as a whole (p<0.001) and modest
enrichment of some motifs (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). However, no single motif was
commonly found in any class of rearrangement.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The sequences either side of each rearrangement junction were then compared to each other.
In most instances the two contributing DNA segments showed a short stretch of identical
sequence, known as an overlapping microhomology, immediately adjacent to the
rearrangement junction which was present only once in the rearranged DNA (Figure 1c,
Table 2, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 6). Approximately 15%
rearrangements showed non-templated sequence at the rearrangement junction (Table 2,
Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figure 7). In many, this is only a few base pairs
long, although the longest segment of this type was 154bp. A further 3.8% of
rearrangements included one or more small fragments of DNA (<500bp) from elsewhere in
the genome interposed between the rearrangement breakpoints identified by the paired end
sequencing. We have previously termed these small DNA fragments “genomic shards”10,17.
Overlapping microhomologies and non-templated sequences at rearrangement junctions are
often considered to be signatures of a non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA double
strand break repair process18-21. The segments of overlapping microhomology are believed
to mediate alignment of the two DNA fragments that are joined. It has, however, recently
been proposed that complex germline rearrangements with genomic shards and overlapping
microhomology might be due to replicative mechanisms21. The small proportion of complex
rearrangements with genomic shards may indicate that this mechanism is relatively
infrequently operative in breast cancer.
It has previously been suggested that there exist multiple NHEJ repair processes which may
be characterised by different lengths of overlapping microhomology at rearrangement
junctions21,22. To investigate this possibility we examined the distribution of

microhomology lengths in each breast cancer (Figure 1c, Supplementary Figure 6). In some
breast cancers, rearrangements with zero base pairs of microhomology were most frequent,
whilst in others rearrangements with two or more base pairs were the commonest class.
Rearrangements with zero base pairs of microhomology were most common in amplicons,
in contrast to all other classes of rearrangement in which the modal class of microhomology
was 2bp (Figure 2). These differences are unlikely to be due to chance (p<0.001) and
suggest that there are at least two classes of NHEJ repair which are operative to different
extents in different breast cancers21.
Because the analysis of paired-end sequences requires alignment to the reference human
genome and because sequences within repetitive elements are more likely to misalign it is
conceivable that we have missed classes of rearrangement mediated by repeats. To
investigate this possibility further we constructed libraries from the breast cancer cell line
HCC1187 in which the sequenced ends were 3kb rather than 500bp apart. The 3kb paired
ends will flank the majority of common repeats and thus allow detection of rearrangements
mediated by them. Although additional rearrangements were detected, a distinct class of
repeat mediated rearrangement was not found (data not shown).
Rearrangements of protein coding genes
Fifty per cent of rearrangements fell within the footprint of a protein coding gene compared
to 40% expected by chance (p<10−7). The reasons for this striking enrichment of
rearrangements in genic regions are not clear. Since rearrangements that confer selective
advantage on a cancer clone are a priori more likely to be located in genes it is conceivable
that some of this effect is due to selection and that a subset of rearrangements is implicated
in cancer development. However, it may be more plausible that there are structural
properties of genic regions that increase the likelihood of a DNA double strand break
occurring, perhaps dependent on active transcription or chromatin configuration.

Twenty-nine rearrangements were predicted to generate in-frame gene fusions. Using exonexon RT-PCR, rearranged transcripts from 19/22 in-frame fusion genes in non-amplified
regions and from 2/6 (1 not determined) in amplified regions were found (Table 3). Thus
most in-frame rearranged genes from non-amplified regions have the requisite 5′ and 3′
DNA sequences for transcript formation and stability. Conversely most from amplified
regions do not and these rearrangements probably represent fragments of one or both genes
reflecting the high density of rearrangements often present in these regions10. Sixty-six inframe internally rearranged genes were also identified. 39/58 assessed showed rearranged
transcripts (Table 4). In some cancers multiple in-frame rearranged and expressed genes are
present (Tables 3 and 4, Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).
Several in-frame fusion genes are potentially of biological interest as candidates for new
cancer genes. Notably, two were members of the ETS family of transcription factors. ETV6
is rearranged to form cancer genes with multiple different fusion partners in leukaemias23,
congenital fibrosarcoma24 and myelodysplastic syndrome. It also forms a rearranged cancer
gene with NTRK3 in the rare subclass of secretory breast cancer25. Here, ETV6 was fused
to ITPR2 (Figure 3) through an inversion involving intron 2, a site previously reported in
other cancers23, and was rearranged in a further breast cancer without clearly forming an inframe fusion gene. ITPR2 encodes Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor Type 2 which is
involved in signal transduction and regulation of cellular calcium fluxes. The second
rearrangement fused EHF, which has not been previously implicated in cancer development,
to NFIA a transcription factor involved in adenovirus replication (Supplementary Figure 3).
Fusion genes implicated in cancer development are likely to be recurrent. However, none of
the novel fusion genes we identified was present in more than one out of the 24 cancers

screened. Three expressed, in-frame fusion genes were examined by FISH (ETV6-ITPR2,
NFIA-EHF and SLC26A6-PRKAR2A) and 20 by RT-PCR across the rearranged exon-exon
junction in 288 additional breast cancer cases. No further examples were found indicating
that they are either passenger events or that they contribute infrequently to breast cancer
development.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Rearrangements were found in several known cancer genes including BRAF, PAX3, PAX5,
NSD1, PBX1, MSI2 and ETV6 (see above). Each of these is a partner in a fusion gene in
other classes of human cancer and was rearranged in two of the 24 samples analysed,
although in many cases an in-frame fusion gene was not obviously generated
(Supplementary Table 8). Rearrangements found in RB, APC, FBXW7 and other recessive
cancer genes may have resulted in gene inactivation to contribute to cancer development.
Several other genes were rearranged in multiple cancers (Supplementary Table 9). Some are
in amplified regions surrounding ERBB2 (for example ACCN1 which is rearranged in four
out of the 24 breast cancers) or other known targets of genomic amplification in breast
cancer. It is likely that these are recurrently rearranged because of the high density of
rearrangements associated with these regions of recurrent genomic amplification. Others,
however, are not in regions of genomic amplification. For example, SHANK2 was
rearranged in five of the 24 breast cancers, while IGF1R, GRHL2, EFNA5, and MACROD2
were each rearranged in four. These recurrently rearranged genes generally have large
genomic footprints and may simply represent bigger targets for randomly positioned
rearrangements (Supplementary Table 9). For some, however, an elevated local rate of DNA
double strand breakage (“fragility”) may also contribute to the clustering of rearrangements.

DISCUSSION

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

This study has generated the most comprehensive insight thus far into patterns of somatic
rearrangement in cancer genomes. Most rearrangements in breast cancer are
intrachromosomal. Tandem duplications appear to be the most common subclass and are
known to form activated cancer genes in other cancer types2627. The high prevalence of
tandem duplications in a subset of cancers suggests the presence of a defect in DNA
maintenance which generates this particular class of rearrangement. The underlying
abnormality responsible for this phenotype is unknown. It may reside in the licensing
mechanisms responsible for defining, priming and monitoring origins of DNA replication28.
Breast cancers are highly heterogeneous and are subclassified on the basis of estrogen
receptor, progesterone receptor and ERBB2 expression and by mRNA expression
profiles29,30. Subclasses defined in these ways show correlations with patterns of genomic
alteration31,32. Breast cancers with many tandem duplications are usually estrogen and
progesterone receptor negative and classified by expression profile as basal-like. In contrast,
cancers with few rearrangements or with rearrangements within amplicons (other than those
involving ERBB2) are usually estrogen receptor positive and classified as Luminal A and
Luminal B types respectively.
Many novel in-frame fusion genes or internally rearranged genes were identified, most of
which were expressed. None, however, were found to be recurrent. Approximately 2%
rearrangements would be expected to generate an in-frame fusion gene by chance, compared
to 1.6% observed. It is therefore likely that most are passenger events. Nevertheless, as
previously suggested for somatic point mutations13,14 it may be that multiple, infrequently
rearranged cancer genes are operative in breast cancer as they are in leukaemia2.
Furthermore, detailed analysis of rearrangement breakpoints will be necessary to investigate
the possibility of fusions between promoters/regulatory elements and intact genes that result

in deregulation of expression. Much larger series will be required to investigate
comprehensively the possibility of recurrent cancer-causing rearrangements in breast cancer.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Exhaustive sequencing of substantial numbers of cancer genomes to yield complete
catalogues of all classes of somatic mutations will gather pace over the next few years. The
current study offers insight into the complexity of rearrangement patterns that will be
encountered in solid tumour genomes, demonstrates the potential for generation of active
rearranged genes that may be implicated in cancer development and illustrates the types of
information that will emerge on mutational processes that have been operative during the
development of individual cancers.

Methods
Library construction and paired-end sequencing

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Genomic libraries from nine breast cancer cell lines and fifteen primary breast cancers were
generated using 5μg of total genomic DNA17. Briefly, 5μg of genomic DNA was randomly
fragmented to between 200 and 700bp by focused acoustic shearing (Covaris Inc.). These
fragments were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel wherefrom the 450-550bp fraction was
excised and extracted using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (with gel dissolution in chaotropic
buffer at room temperature to ensure recovery of AT rich sequences). The size fractionated
DNA was end repaired using T4 DNA polymerase, Klenow polymerase and T4
polynucleotide kinase. The resulting blunt ended fragments were A-tailed using a 3′-5′
exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragment and ligated to Illumina paired-end adaptor
oligonucleotides in a ‘TA’ ligation at room temperature for 15 minutes. The ligation mixture
was electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and size-selected by removing a 2 mm horizontal
slice of gel at ~600bp using a sterile scalpel blade. DNA was extracted from the agarose as
above. 10ng of the resulting DNA was PCR amplified for 18 cycles using 2 units of Phusion
polymerase. PCR cleanup was performed using AMPure beads (Agencourt BioSciences
Corporation) following the manufacturer’s protocol. We prepared Genome Analyzer pairedend flow cells on the supplied Illumina cluster station and generated 37bp paired-end
sequence reads on the Illumina Genome Analyser platform following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Images from the Genome Analyzer were processed using the manufacturer’s
software to generate FASTQ sequence files. These were aligned to the human genome
(NCBI build 36.2) using the MAQ algorithm v0.4.333.
Reads removed from structural variant analysis
Reads which failed to align in the expected orientation or distance apart were further
evaluated using the SSAHA algorithm34 to remove mapping errors in repetitive regions of
the genome. In addition, during the PCR enrichment step, multiple PCR products derived
from the same genomic template can occasionally be sequenced. To remove these, reads
where both ends mapped to identical genomic locations (plus or minus a single nucleotide),
were considered PCR duplicates, and only the read pair with the highest mapping quality
retained. Further, erroneous mapping of reads originating from DNA present in sequence
gaps in NCBI build 36.2 were removed by excluding the highly repetitive regions within
1Mb of a centromeric or telomeric sequence gap. Additional read pairs, where both ends
mapped to within less than 500bp of one another, but in the incorrect orientation were
excluded from analysis, unless support for a putative rearrangement was indicated by
additional read pairs. The majority of these singleton read pairs are likely to be artifacts
resulting from either intramolecular rearrangements generated during library amplification
or mispriming of the sequencing oligonucleotide within the bridge amplified cluster. Finally,
read pairs where both ends mapped to within 500bp of a previously identified germline

structural variant were removed from further analysis, as these were likely to represent the
same germline allele.
Generation of genome wide copy number plots

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Full methods for generation of high resolution, genome wide copy number information can
be found in reference17. Briefly, the human reference genome was divided into bins of
~15kb of mappable sequence and high quality, correctly mapping read pairs, with a MAQ
alternative mapping quality ≥35, were assigned to their correct bin and plotted. A binary
circular segmentation algorithm originally developed for genomic hybridisation microarray
data35 was applied to these raw plots to identify change-points in copy number by iterative
binary segmentation.
PCR confirmation of putative rearrangements
The following criteria were used to determine which incorrectly mapping reads pairs were
evaluated by confirmatory PCR: (i) Reads mapping ≥10kb apart spanned by ≥2 read
independent read pairs (where at least one read pair had an alternative mapping quality ≥35);
(ii) Reads mapping ≥10kb apart spanned by 1 read pair (with an alternative mapping quality
≥35), with both ends mapping to within 100kb of a change-point in copy number identified
by the segmentation algorithm; iii) Reads mapping ≥600bp apart spanned by ≥2 read
independent read pairs (where at least one read pair had an alternative mapping quality ≥35)
with both ends mapping to within 100kb of a change-point in copy number identified by the
segmentation algorithm; iv) Selected read pairs mapping between 600bp and 10kb apart
spanned by ≥2 read independent read pairs (where at least one read pair had an alternative
mapping quality ≥35).

Primers were designed to span the possible breakpoint by locating them in the 1 kb outside
region the paired-end reads, for a maximum product size of 1kb. PCR reactions were
performed on tumor and normal genomic DNA for each set of primers at least twice, using
the following thermocycling parameters: 95°C x 15min (95°C x 30s, 60°C x 30s, 72°C x
30s) for 30 cycles, 72°C x 10min. Products giving a band were sequenced by conventional
Sanger capillary methods and compared to the reference sequence to identify breakpoints.
Somatically acquired rearrangements were defined as those generating a reproducible band
in the tumor DNA with no band in the normal DNA following PCR amplification, together
with unambiguously mapping sequence data suggesting a rearrangement.
RT-PCR and cloning
Total RNA (100ng) from the tumor and matched constitutional DNA/lymphoblastoid cell
lines was reverse transcribed into single stranded cDNAs using Reverse Transcriptase II
(Invitrogen) and Oligo (dT)12-18 (Invitrogen) in 20μl reaction at 25 °C for 10 min, 42°C for
50min, 72°C for 15min. The cDNA was then diluted with 30μl of distilled water before
subsequent PCR amplification. Resulting bands were sequenced to confirm the specificity of
the reaction and the presence of the aberrant transcript. To detect fusion transcripts, we used
forward primers in the putative 5′ partner gene and reverse primers from the 3′ partner. To
detect rearranged transcripts, we used forward primers and reverse primers corresponding to
the predicted exons fused. When multiple bands, possibly suggestive of splice variants were
detected, all bands were excised from the gel and capillary sequenced separately.
DNA probes and Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)
FISH based on the split apart or fusion probe strategy was used to validate NFIA-EHF gene
aberrations. For the NFIA-EHF fusion probe, BAC clones (http://www.ensembl.org/,

was labelled with either biotin or digoxygenin-l I-dUTP (Roche) using the Bioprime kit
(Invitrogen) and FISH was performed as described previously36. Biotinylated probes were
detected with Cy5–Streptavidin (Invitrogen, Zymed Laboratories) and digoxigenin-labeled
BACs, with anti-digoxigenin-fluorescein, Roche (green). Nuclei and chromosomes were
counterstained with DAPI. Images were captured with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope
equipped with a CCD camera (Applied Imaging Diagnostic Instruments) and Cytovision
software, version 2.81 (Applied Imaging). Only morphologically intact and non-overlapping
nuclei were analyzed.
Breakpoint analysis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

All 1832 breakpoints defined to the basepair level were used in the analysis of breakpoint
sequence context, excluding shards and overlapping regions. Analysis was performed on all
breakpoints together, and also on subsets divided into deletions, tandem duplications,
amplicons, other intrachromosomal events, and all interchromosomal events. 10bp and
100bp on either side of the breakpoint sites were extracted for analysis. As a control, for
each real breakpoint, 100 sequences of the same length were extracted from the regions
extending from 10,000 to 20,000bp away from either side of the break. These matched
control sequences were used as a comparison in the analysis to account for any regional
differences such as large variations in GC or repeat content. The length of nucleotide tracts
(polynucleotide, polypurine/polypurimidine, and alternating polypyrimidine/polypurine)
were compared in the breakpoint and control regions using a one-tailed Mann-Whitney U
test and the average GC content and presence of known motifs associated with DNA
breaks37 were compared using a Fisher exact test.
Enrichment of breakpoints in genes
To determine whether breakpoints were enriched in genic regions, we compared the number
of breakpoints falling within genes to an empirically-derived expected proportion. We
classified breakpoints as genic or intergenic based on if their coordinates fell within a gene
as annotated by Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/, Ensembl release 54). To account for the
fact that some areas of the genome will be difficult to sequence align to with short reads, we
derived the expected proportion of breakpoints that should fall within a gene from the actual
proportion of read pairs that aligned to genic regions. Treating each breakpoint of a
rearrangement independently, we then compared the number of breakpoints falling within a
gene to this expected proportion using a Chi-squared test to obtain a p-value for the
overrepresentation of breakpoints in genes.

Inter-individual heterogeneity in the patterns of microhomology
Comparison of microhomology and non-templated sequence distributions across individual
samples was performed using Scholz and Stephens’ k-sample generalisation of the
Anderson-Darling goodness-of-fit test, with 10,000 data permutations to generate the
statistic’s null distribution38.
