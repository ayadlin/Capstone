Abstract
Histone deacetylases (HDAC) modify the architecture of
chromatin, leading to decreased gene expression, an effect
that is reversed by HDAC inhibition. The balance between
deacetylation and acetylation is central to many biological
events including the regulation of cell proliferation and cancer
but also the differentiation of immune T cells. The effects of
HDAC inhibition on the interaction between antitumor
effector T cells and tumor cells are not known. Here, we
studied presentation of a universal self-tumor antigen,
telomerase reverse transcriptase, in human tumor cells during
HDAC inhibition. We found that HDAC inhibition with
trichostatin A was associated with a decreased presentation
and diminished killing of tumor cells by CTLs. Using gene array
analysis, we found that HDAC inhibition resulted in a decrease
of genes coding for proteasome catalytic proteins and for
tapasin, an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein involved
in the MHC class I pathway of endogenous antigen presentation. Our findings indicate that epigenetic changes in
tumor cells decrease self-tumor antigen presentation and
contribute to reduced recognition and killing of tumor cells
by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This mechanism could contribute
to tumor escape from immune surveillance. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Epigenetic modifications influence gene activity without altering
DNA sequences from the transcriptional activity of selected genes
to the individual’s susceptibility to disease (1), and include both
transient modifications and stable heritable changes (2). Acetylation and deacetylation of histones impart modification on the
architecture of chromatin (3), which reflect on increased or
decreased gene expression through the opposing activities of
histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDAC).
Acetylation plays a critical role in the regulation of cell proliferation
(4) and transcriptional silencing associated with a generalized loss
of acetylation has been found in cancer (5). Levels of acetylation
also play a role in the differentiation of T cells (6, 7) and in the
expression of ligands for natural killer (NK) cells (8). Although
mouse tumor cells treated with high dose HDAC inhibitors are
immunogenic and confer partial protection from tumor growth
in vivo (9), little is known on whether epigenetic changes of

chromatin structure influence antigen presentation in human
tumor cells.
Here, we studied the effect of HDAC inhibiton on the
presentation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TRT), a bona fide
universal antigen in human cancer cells (10, 11) using trichostatin
A (TSA), a natural product hydroximate with high affinity for the
catalytic site of class I and II HDAC (12). We monitored the surface
density of complexes formed between the major histocompatibility/Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A2 molecule and two highaffinity 9mer hTRT peptides: 540ILAKFLHWL548 (p540) and
865
RLVDDFLLV873 (p865; ref. 11). Because telomerase is expressed
in >85% of human cancers (13) and CD8 T cells specific for p540
are found in the blood of cancer patients at high frequency (14),
the model system studied herein is relevant to better understanding the relation between cancer cells and the antitumor immune
response in humans. Our findings show a reduction of HLA-A2/
hTRT peptide complexes at the cell surface of TSA-treated human
tumor cells. More importantly, using a highly specific human
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone, we found that TSA-treated
cancer cell killing was reduced compared with untreated cells.
This finding may be relevant to understand how immunosurvelliance of cancer cells can be affected in vivo.

Rosenberg, Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD), and
TAP-deficient T2 cells (the kind gift of Dr. P. Creswell, Yale University, New
Haven, CT) were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS). TSA, Lactacystin, Sodium butyrate, and BFA were
purchased from Sigma.

Immunochemical Detection of hTRT, HLA-A2/hTRT
Complexes, and HLA-A2
Detection of HLA-A2/hTRT complexes at the cell surface. HLA-A2/
p540 and HLA-A2/p865 complexes were detected with the human Fab 4A9
and 3H2 (15), respectively. Briefly, cells were treated with TSA (1 Ag/mL),
BFA (10 Ag/mL), or lactacystin (10 Amol/mL). After washing, cells were
incubated with human Fab 4A9 or 3H2 (2 Ag per reaction) for 1.5 h at +4jC.
After washing, cells were counterstained with FITC-conjugated goat
antibody to human Fab (Jackson Laboratories) for 45 min. Surface staining
for HLA-A2 was performed using monoclonal antibody BB7.2 (ATTC)
followed by a FITC-conjugated goat antibody to mouse IgG (eBioscience).
Cells were analyzed in a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) using the BD

Institutional Review Board protocol. HTERT-specific human CTL lines were
generated according to published procedure (11). Briefly, peripheral blood
mononuclear cells were stimulated with hTERT peptides in vitro in 24-well
plates using autologous irradiated adherents cells as antigen-presenting cells
and interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-7. After three to four rounds of culture, CTLs
were screened in a standard 51Cr-release assay. The cold target inhibition
assay (11) was performed to ensure the specificity of the CTL clone. T2 cells
were pulsed with either p540 or the HIV p17 gag 77-85 peptide as a control.
An adaptation of this assay was used to investigate killing inhibition where
51
Cr-labeled targets treated with TSA were used (Fig. 6C and D). In these
experiments, the E:T ratio was kept constant at 20:1, whereas the cold/hot
inhibitor ratio varied as indicated in the legend to the figure.

Proteasome Activity Assay
JY cells were treated with TSA (1 Ag/mL), Sodium Butyrate (20 Ag/mL),
Lactacystin (3.8 Ag/mL), or 5 AL of DMSO (untreated) in RPMI supplemented
with 5% FBS for 18 h. Sodium Butyrate was used as a control based on the
fact that to the best of our knowledge it is the only HDAC inhibitor reported
to reduce proteasome activity beside TSA (16). Lactacystin served as a
generic inhibitor of proteasome function. Cells were harvested, washed, and
resuspended in complete medium. Proteasome activity assay was performed
using the cell-based luminescent assay Proteasome-Glo (Promega) in white
flat-bottomed 96-well plates (Costar) with 20,000 cells per well. Luminescence was measured in a plate reader Infinite M200 (TECAN). Assays were
done in triplicate and repeated twice with similar results.

Deconvolution and Fluorescence Microscopy
Cells treated with TSA and immunostained as described above were also
used for deconvolution microscopy studies. Briefly, after staining with
antibodies, cells were incubated with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-HCl for
15 min, and then cytospun onto glass slides. Slides were air dried and
mounted in glycerol using coverslips (Fisher Scientific). The slides were
examined by epifluorescence microscopy (Nikon T200 microscope)
mounted on Delta Vision deconvolution microscope (Applied Precision,
LLC). In some cases, where indicated, deconvolution was performed on the
resultant image stacks using SoftWorx as supplied by the manufacturer
(Applied Precision, LLC). Images shown in Figs. 2 and 3 were volume
projections of several consecutive optical sections taken from the center of
the image stacks after deconvolution. In experiments where comparative
quantitation of fluorescence was performed, samples to be compared were
stained under identical conditions with the same reagents at the same time.
Samples were imaged under identical conditions. Camera exposure time
was identical and pixel intensities were kept within the linear range of the
camera (CoolSnap HQ; Princeton Instruments). Quantitation was performed on volume projections composed of several consecutive optical
sections. The resultant volume projections were scaled identically.
Quantitation was performed using SoftWorx at Data Inspector.

Reverse Transcriptase-PCR
hTRT mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis.
Briefly, 106 cells were treated with TSA (1 Ag/mL) for the indicated time,
and total RNA was isolated using the RNAeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The
RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA by RT-Omniscript (Qiagen) for 1 h
at 37jC. cDNA amplification was induced using specific primers (forward
5¶-ACCAAGAAGTTCATCTCCCTGG-3¶ and reverse 5¶-GCTCATCTTCCACGTCAGCTC-3¶). Amplification of the glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA served as a control for RNA extraction.

Quantitative RT-PCR
cDNA was generated from 200 ng of total RNA using Omniscript Reverse
Transcriptase (Qiagen). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out
using the Taqman method on a LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system
(Roche) and analyzed by efficiency-corrected relative quantification method.
Sequences for probes and primers were as follows: tapasin (NM_003190.3):
Forward, CCAGAGCCTCAGCAGGAG; Reverse, GGGTGAGGACAGTCAGTACCA; Universal ProbeLibrary probe #9 (Roche Applied Science): GADPH,
Forward AGCCACATCGCTGAGACA; Reverse, GCCCAATACGACCAAATCC;
Universal ProbeLibrary probe #60 (Roche Applied Science). Results were
expressed as fold change compared with untreated cells.

DNA Microarray
Biotinylated cRNA was prepared using the Illumina RNA Amplification
kit (Ambion, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s directions starting with
250 ng total RNA. The labeling approach uses a modified Eberwine
protocol (17) by which mRNA is converted to cDNA, followed by an
amplification/labeling step mediated by T7 DNA polymerase. The cDNA
and cRNA filter cartridges (Ambion) were used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions for RT and IVT cleanup, respectively. For
microarray analysis, the Illumina Human Expression BeadChip was used
(Illumina). Hybridization of labeled cRNA to the BeadChip, and washing
and scanning were performed according to the Illumina BeadStation 500
manual. Essentially, the amplified, biotin-labeled human cRNA samples
were resuspended in a solution of Hyb E1 buffer (Illumina) and 25% (v/v)
formamide at a final concentration of 25 ng/AL. cRNA (1.5 Ag of each)
were hybridized. Hybridization was allowed to proceed at 55 C, for
18 h after which, the bead array matrix was washed for 10 min with
1 High temperature buffer (Illumina), followed by a subsequent 10-min
wash in Wash E1BC buffer. The arrays were then washed with 100%
ethanol for 10 min to strip off any remaining adhesive on the chip. A
2-min E1BC wash was performed to remove residual ethanol. The arrays
were blocked for 5 min with 1% (w/v) casein-PBS (Pierce). The array
signal was developed via 10-min incubation with Streptavidin-Cy3 at a
final concentration of 1 Ag/mL solution of (GE Healthcare) in 1% caseinPBS blocking solution. The Human Expression BeadChip was washed a
final time in Wash E1BC buffer for 5 min and subsequently dried via
centrifugation for 4 min at a setting of 275 rcf. The arrays were scanned
on the Illumina BeadArray Reader, a confocal-type imaging system with
532 (Cye3) nm laser illumination. The bead signals were computed with
weighted averages of pixel intensities, and local background is subtracted.
Sequence-type signal was calculated by averaging corresponding bead
signals with outliers removed (using median absolute deviation).
Preliminary data analysis and QC was carried out using the BeadStudio
software (Illumina). Simultaneous normalization of multiple microarrays
was done using the mloess method (18).

Results
HDAC inhibition down-regulates hTRT presentation. Previously, it was shown that TSA treatment increases the transcription
and expression of hTRT in normal (19, 20) and cancer (21) cells.
Consistent with this report, we found that treatment with TSA
induced an increase in the transcriptional activity of the hTRT gene
in the HLA-A2+/hTRT+ lymphoblastoid JY cell line. In repeated
independent experiments, specific mRNA amplification was
consistently visible after 30 minutes, peaked at 18 hours, and
persisted for an additional 24 hours after TSA removal (data not
shown). We reasoned that the increase in hTRT transcription could
yield an increase in the number of HLA-A2/hTRT peptide
complexes displayed at the cell surface (antigen presentation).
Therefore, we investigated complex formation between the HLA-A2
molecule and two high affinity (f4 nmol/L) hTRT peptides, p540
and p865. Detection of the two complexes was performed using
two human recombinant Fab antibodies, 4A9, which is specific for
the HLA-A2/p540 complex, and 3H2, which is specific for the HLAA2/p865 complex (15). Notably, each antibody only recognized the
complex formed with the homologous hTRT peptide. Complexes
with hybrid peptides comprising 5 amino acids residues of the
homologous peptide and 4 amino acid residues from a different
hTRT peptide did not mediate binding (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, in
several independent flow cytometry analyses, surface staining by
either 4A9 or 3H2 was substantially reduced (Fig. 1B) in TSAtreated JY cells compared with untreated cells. Diminished surface
expression of the HLA-A2/hTRT peptide complex persisted for
24 h after TSA removal (data not shown). Surface expression of

of 4A9 and 3H2 antibodies for HLA-A2/hTRT complexes. Left, 4A9 antibody (2 Ag) in 100 AL was used to stain unpulsed TAP-deficient T2 cells or cells pulsed with
10 Ag/mL of p540 or the hybrid peptides p540/p865 (ILAKFFLLV) and p540/p49 (ILAKFRRRV). Right, 3H2 antibody was similarly used to stain unpulsed TAP-deficient
T2 cells or cells pulsed with p865 or the hybrid peptides p865/p540 (RLLVDDLHWL) and p865/p49 (RLVDDRRRV). B, flow cytometry analysis of surface staining
for the HLA-A2/p540 and HLA-A2/p865 complex in TSA-treated JY cells and stained by either antibody 4A9 or 3H2 (2 Ag per reaction). JY cells were treated for 8 or
18 h as indicated. Analyses were performed as detailed in Materials and Methods. C, flow cytometry analysis of surface staining for the HLA-A2 in TSA-treated JY cells.
Analyses were performed as detailed in Materials and Methods. Results are representative of multiple independent experiments.

HLA-A2 molecules was similar in treated and untreated cells (Fig.
1C), although in 3 of 10 experiments, a decrease (10–20%) in mean
fluorescence intensity was observed after TSA treatment.
To better visualize the reduction in antigen presentation, we
used deconvolution microscopy focusing on the HLA-A2/p540
complex because this has a longer half-life (f6 hours) than the
HLA-A2/p865 complex (11). In untreated JY cells, HLA-A2/p540
complexes were visible with a bright surface granular staining
(Fig. 2A, left). However, fewer complexes were seen in TSA-treated
versus untreated cells (Fig. 2A, right). A comparative, quantitative
analysis of the corresponding images showed a 3-fold decrease in
the intensity of complex staining in TSA-treated cells (Fig. 2B). The
same quantitative difference was documented in three indepen-

dent experiments. A higher magnification of single cells further
shows this phenomenon (Fig. 2C).
Decreased antigen presentation was not unique to JY cells
because TSA treatment (18 hours) of the HLA-A2+/hTRT +
melanoma cell line 629.38 resulted again in transcriptional
activation of hTRT (Fig. 3A) and, importantly, in diminished surface
expression of the complex (Fig. 3B). TSA treatment increased
somewhat the detection of HLA-A2 molecules at the cell surface
(Fig. 3C). Collectively, whereas a decrease in presentation is not
supported by a decrease in surface expression of HLA-A2 molecules,
the data show that chromatin changes after HDAC inhibition by
TSA promote hTRT transcription but decrease presentation of MHC
complexes formed with high affinity hTRT peptides.

Gene profiling analysis. MHC I/peptide complexes originate in
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where nascent MHC I molecules
are loaded with peptides that are generated in the proteasome and
are translocated into the ER by the transporter associated with
antigen processing (TAP). Because the MHC I/peptide cargo in the
ER is a function of peptide input from the cytosol and the local
synthesis of MHC I molecules, we reasoned that the 3-fold lower
antigen presentation concomitant with an increase in antigen
expression in the cytosol could have several explanations. For
instance, TSA could inhibit the proteasome and/or TAP, hence
diminishing assembly of MHC I/peptide complexes in the ER. To
this end, we tested TAP expression levels by flow cytometry in
TSA-treated cells and found no change. This lead to the further
possibility that proteasome, or events in the ER-Golgi, could impair

peptide generation, MHC I/peptide complex maturation, and/or
egress from the ER. To this end, the effect of TSA on surface
expression of the HLA-A2/p540 complex was compared with that
of lactacystin, a selective inhibitor of the proteasome, and BFA, an
ER ! Golgi transport inhibitor that also inhibits MHC I/peptide
complex presentation. Lactacystin, markedly reduced presentation
compared with untreated as well as TSA-treated JY cells (Fig. 4A).
BFA (18-hour treatment) blocked completely surface expression of
the complex (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, BFA treatment for 4 hours did
not affect the cell surface expression of the MHC/peptide complex
(data not shown), in agreement with the half-life (f6 hours) of the
complex. This suggests that the diminished presentation associated
with HDAC inhibition by TSA could be due to either a partial defect
of the proteasome, a defect in ER ! Golgi transport, or both.

expression was assessed by flow cytometry.

To distinguish between these possibilities, a genome-wide
expression profiling of TSA-treated (18 hours) JY cells was
performed to see which gene pathway(s) might be involved in
reducing antigen presentation by HDAC inhibition. Proteasome
genes. Peptides for the MHC I are generated mainly by the
proteasome and other cytoplasmic proteases. The 26S proteasome
that is responsible for the degradation of poly-ubiquinated proteins
is composed of outer structural a-subunits and inner proteolytic
h-subunits that are encoded by different genes. The microarray
analysis of the proteasome in TSA-treated JY cells showed an
overall down-regulation of h-subunit genes (Fig. 4B), with
h-subunits 8 (PSMB8) and 10 (PSMB10) being down-regulated
the most. Of note, gene expression of the cytoplasmic peptidase
TPPII was unchanged (data not shown), suggesting that the downmodulation of the h-subunits of the proteasome could be
responsible, in part, for a downstream diminished loading of
peptides (i.e., p540 and p865) onto the MHC I molecules in the ER.
ER stress genes. ER stress responsive genes, such as DNA damage–
inducible transcript 3 (Ddit3), PP1RS15A (Gadd34), Heat shock
protein 5 (Grp78, Bip), Wolfram syndrome 1 (Wfs), activating
transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and calreticulin, were all upregulated (Fig. 4B). This indicates that a downstream effect of
HDAC inhibition is the induction of ER stress. This is not surprising
because TSA is known to transcriptionally modulate many (2%)

www.aacrjournals.org

genes in malignant human cells (22), and supports the notion that
TSA-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells may be mediated by ER
stress. Consistent with the induction of ER stress is the
transcriptional activation of proinflammatory genes such as tumor
necrosis factor-a (7) and IL-23 p19 (4; data not shown), which
are up-regulated during ER stress (23). ER and Golgi resident and
trafficking related genes. Analysis of these genes showed an overall
minor increase in ER!Golgi trafficking genes indicating that the
diminished presentation of HLA-A2/p540 complexes by TSA
treatment is unlikely to be due to a decrease in ER!Golgi
trafficking. MHC I antigen presentation–related genes. Transcriptional analysis of the MHC I pathway was performed to identify
changes that could explain the diminished surface expression of
the HLA-A2/p540 complex. Overall, MHC I genes were unchanged,
although a slight negative trend was observed (Fig. 4B). The
increase in Bap31 (an ER resident type II transmembrane protein
exerting quality control on MHC I/peptide complexes) and the
decrease in Der1 (an ER retrotranslocation transmembrane
protein) suggest a program to conserve MHC I molecules. In
contrast, tapasin, a key regulator of TAP and MHC I peptide
binding, and a gatekeeper of MHC I/peptide complex stability (24),
was markedly diminished. Consistently, transcription of the
tapasin-like gene, which shares similarity at the tridimensional
level with tapasin, was also markedly down-regulated. Finally,
additional members of the peptide loading complex and MHC I
maturation (TAP1, TAP2, calnexin, and ERp57) showed little
change, if any, with the exception of calreticulin (2 increase).
HDAC inhibition affects the proteasome and tapasin. Gene
profiling analysis proved of key value in assessing the possible
downstream targets of TSA with respect self-tumor antigen
presentation. First, we noted that wide spectrum HDAC inhibition
down-regulated transcription of most genes of the proteasome
complex corresponding to a global decrease in proteasome activity
of f30% (Fig. 5A). Because hTRT proteolysis requires ubiquination
and is mediated by the proteasome (25), the decrease in
proteasome activity by HDAC inhibition is consistent with the
decrease in presentation of hTRT. Because peptide generation in
the proteasome is the first step in antigen processing, the observed
diminished presentation of hTRT may reflect in part an effect on
the proteasome. Second, HDAC inhibition promoted ER stress,
something not observed previously after TSA treatment. Several
considerations suggest that ER stress may not play a crucial and
direct role in diminishing presentation of hTRT because (a) hTRT
transcription increases after TSA treatment, whereas the unfolded
protein response (ER stress) in general diminish transcription (26),
and (b) treatment with thapsigargin (an inhibitor of the Ca2+ pump
and inducer of ER stress) did not diminish the surface expression of
the MHC I/peptide complex (data not shown). Third, a defect in
ER!Golgi transport of MHC I/peptide complexes is also unlike
because most genes involved in transport and trafficking
underwent discrete up-regulation upon TSA treatment, ruling out
defects in ER!Golgi transport. Finally, selected changes in the
MHC I–related genes were observed with tapasin being markedly
down-regulated. Tapasin down-regulation observed in the array
analysis (Fig. 4B) was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 5B). Tapasin is
involved in optimal loading of MHC I molecules with peptide and
in retaining unstable MHC I/peptide complexes in the ER, whereas
favoring egress of stable, high-affinity complexes (27), and in the
retrieval of COPI vesicles containing MHC I molecules loaded with
unstable peptides (28). Thus, its down-regulation can explain the
diminished antigen presentation. Because other genes related to

MHC I/peptide complex biogenesis, such as calreticulin, Grp78/
Bip, and COPI, were all moderately up-regulated, it seems as if the
down-regulation of tapasin affected the quality control and sorting
of MHC I/peptide complexes in and from the ER, hence playing a
central role in the diminished presentation of high affinity HLA-A2/
hTRT complexes.
Reduced killing of TSA-treated tumor cells by CD8 T cells.
Recognition of the MHC I/peptide complex is the structural basis
for specific killing of tumor cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. To
assess whether the decreased presentation by TSA treatment had
an effect on tumor target recognition and lysis, we performed
killing assays using three different HLA-A2+/hTRT+ cancer cells
(JY, Mel629.38, and LnCap) as targets and in vitro generated human

p540-specific CTL as the effectors. The percent lysis of TSA-treated
T2 cells pulsed with p540 was similar to that of untreated targets
(Fig. 6A), suggesting that TSA does not interfere with cell surface
MHC loading with peptide, nor does it change the susceptibility to
lysis of these tumor cells. Interestingly, after TSA treatment the
lysis of all three tumor cells was markedly diminished compared
with untreated cells (Fig. 6A). The specificity of the CTL clone for
the HLA-A2/p540 complex was shown by a canonical cold target
inhibition assay (11). As shown, the lysis of JY cells was specifically
and completely competed for by T2 cells pulsed with p540 but
not T2 cells pulsed with the control HIV gag peptide (Fig. 6B).
To further prove the functional relevance of HDAC inhibition–
induced reduced presentation of p540, new cold target inhibition

genes; and MHC I–related genes. The fold changes are noted on the respective color scales. Two independent experiments were performed and shown.

presentation of the HLA-A2/p540 complex rendering cells less
susceptible to lysis by CTL, inhibition by cold targets pulsed with
p540 would be more effective diminishing killing of hot targets. As
shown, killing of TSA-treated targets was markedly reduced in the
presence of p540-pulsed cold inhibitors compared with control
cold inhibitors (Fig. 6C and D). Of note, this effect was dose
dependent and almost complete at the highest cold/hot ratio.
Collectively, these results show that HDAC inhibition decreases
presentation, and this negatively affects killing by specific CTL.

Discussion
We show that HDAC inhibition in human cancer cells diminishes
the presentation of high affinity peptides of telomerase reverse
transcriptase, a self-tumor antigen. HDAC inhibition also downregulates proteasome genes and tapasin, a key ER-associated gene
of the class I pathway. Importantly, we show that subsequent to
these changes, tumor cells are killed less efficiently by cytotoxic T
lymphocytes. Collectively, our data suggest that epigenetic
modifications of tumor cells can affect self-tumor antigens
presentation.
Although HDAC inhibitors alter 2% to 5% of the genome
depending on the cell type and the inhibitor (22, 29), we could
identify transcriptional changes that directly relate to the MHC I
pathway of antigen presentation provisionally excluding defects in
transport along the secretory pathway. In light of our findings, we
propose that modifications associated with HDAC inhibition by
TSA modulate hTRT presentation involving (a) down-regulation
of proteasome’s genes with diminished proteasome function
(f30%) and (b) down-regulation (f80%) of tapasin. Because
tapasin impairs the quality control and sorting mechanisms for
high-affinity peptide complexes, a decrease in its expression and
function would effect on the MHC I peptide repertoire, favoring the
egress of MHC I molecules bound to unstable (low affinity)
peptides. Several facts favor this hypothesis. Tapasin-deficient mice
have defective immune responses with an altered MHC I/peptide
repertoire (30). Deficiency of tapasin in mice results in the

recognition of epitopes associated with impaired peptide processing (31). MHC I/peptide presentation in tapasin (/) human
cells is subverted qualitatively and quantitatively (32). Thus, by
altering the composition of the MHC I/peptide complexes in favor
of low affinity peptide complexes, and by decreasing antigen
presentation, HDAC inhibition reduces presentation of highaffinity self-antigen peptides in tumor cells. This scenario assumes
that the abundance of hTRT relative to other ubiquinated
proteins remains the same before and after HDAC inhibition.
Furthermore, although the main effect of TSA at the transcriptional level is through histone acetylation, a direct effect on
tapasin by acetylation of the double lysine motif at the COOH
terminus (33) cannot be ruled out.
That HDAC inhibition decreases the presentation of a self-tumor
antigen is new and at variance with recent findings that mouse
tumor cell lines treated with TSA undergo the up-regulation of
genes of the MHC Class I pathway, including TAP and tapasin
(34). A discrepancy between the present report and the studies
in mouse cells is unclear and may reflect species differences. Of
note, however, antigen presentation in mouse tumor cells was
not studied with the aid of an anticomplex antibody as it was
done here. Finally, the down-regulation of tapasin documented
here is surprising in light of the mouse data. Because HDAC
inhibition opens the chromatin and transcriptionally activates
many genes, down-regulation of tapasin may be the indirect
effect of genes not yet identified. Future studies will need to
address this issue.
hTRT is a self-antigen in human cancer cells (35) and it may be
involved in immune surveillance because cancer patients, but not
normal individuals, carry hTRT-specific CD8 T cells in their blood
(14). Here, chromatin acetylation by HDAC inhibition leads
unexpectedly to decreased antigen presentation of hTRT and
diminished killing by human CTL (Fig. 6A), suggesting that this
may be yet another mechanism of immune evasion. Because
previous studies in normal human cells showed that hTRT plays an
important role in resetting chromatin architecture during DNA
replication (36), the finding that HDAC inhibition diminishes hTRT
presentation suggests that changes in the equilibrium between
hTRT and chromatin that is normally in place to preserve the DNA

damage response (37), is a fail-safe mechanism to oppose
recognition of tumor cells by adaptive cellular T-cell responses,
which are the main effector immune defense against cancer.
Taken together, the above considerations suggest that HDAC
inhibition in tumor cells could lead to evasion of immune
surveillance (38). Several reports indicate that tapasin is downregulated in tumors (39–44), implying that its down-regulation may
somehow be linked with poor presentation of tumor antigens as
well as poor tumor protection by T cells in vivo. Interestingly,
impaired tapasin expression in tumor cells can be reversed by IFNg
(42), excluding genetic alterations as the underlying molecular
mechanism of such deficiency. Because IFNg may impart

epigenetic modifications to chromatin, it seems as if epigenetic
changes are at the origin of this type of immune evasion by cancer
cells. The above considerations on potential evasion of immune
surveillance need, however, to be seen in the broader context of the
reported increase in expression of ligands for the NKG2D receptor
on human NK cells by HDAC inhibitors (45, 46). Higher expression
of these ligands would increase susceptibility to killing by NK cells,
hence counterbalancing the diminished killing by cytotoxic T cells.
Whether or not the epigenetic regulation of hTRT presentation
reported herein applies to other self-tumor antigens remains
untested. Of interest, however, TSA activates the transcription of
the melanoma-associated MAGE A1, A2, A3, and A12 genes in a

that epigenetic changes by HDAC inhibition affect the presentation
of hTRT, a universal self-tumor antigen, suggests a potentially
important new link between epigenetic regulation of cancer cells
and immune surveillance (38).
