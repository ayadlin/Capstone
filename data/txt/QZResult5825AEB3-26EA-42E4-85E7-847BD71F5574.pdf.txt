Abstract
To determine whether platinum-DNA adducts and/or mRNA
expression of the excision nuclease excision repair crosscomplementation group 1 (ERCC1) from peripheral blood
leukocytes (PBL) were associated with clinical outcome in
women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), participants that
had previously untreated, optimally resected, stage III EOC
were randomized to paclitaxel plus cisplatin or carboplatin.
DNA and RNA were extracted from PBLs collected 20 to
28 h post–drug infusion. DNA adducts were measured by
atomic absorption spectroscopy. ERCC1 expression was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR. There were 170 cases fully
evaluable for DNA adducts and ERCC1 mRNA expression.
Adduct levels ranged from 0.43 to 131 fmol platinum/Mg
DNA in 140 samples; and adducts were not detectable in 30
samples. ERCC1 mRNA was detectable in 132 samples and
undetectable in 38. ERCC1 mRNA expression in PBLs was
not associated with any clinical end point measured. The presence of detectable versus undetectable adducts was associated with longer median progression-free survival (20.4
versus 15.6 months; P = 0.084) and overall survival (60.3 versus
36.3 months; P = 0.029), respectively. Unadjusted Cox
regression modeling indicated a trend toward a reduced risk
of disease progression [hazard ratio (HR), 0.686; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.447–1.054; P = 0.086] and a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death (HR, 0.607;
95% CI, 0.385–0.958; P = 0.032) for women with detectable
versus undetectable adducts. After adjusting for clinicopathologic variables, detectable adducts were not an independent
predictor of progression-free survival or overall survival. The
presence of platinum-DNA adducts, but not ERCC1 mRNA
expression, in PBLs was associated with better survival, but
was not an independent predictor of clinical outcome in
optimal advanced EOC. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4474–81]

ovarian cancer in this country in 2007 (1). Currently, 68% of ovarian
cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and women with this
diagnosis have a 5-year survival rate of 29% (1). Staging laparotomy
with cytoreduction followed by platinum-taxane chemotherapy is
currently the standard of care for women with previously untreated,
advanced-stage disease in the United States (2–7). Although we
currently lack useful means of predicting which ovarian cancer
patients are most likely to benefit from platinum-plus-taxane–
based chemotherapy, such a capability could theoretically allow us
to selectively treat patients, depending on their likelihood to have a
favorable clinical response and long-term survival, thus bringing
novel treatments up front and avoiding unnecessary adverse effects
in those unlikely to respond to standard therapy.
Research on the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that
underlie resistance to platinum agents and their biological effect
suggests the possibility of defining which patients are at increased
risk for responding or not responding to platinum-based
chemotherapy by measuring platinum-DNA adduct levels in
peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). The level of platinum-DNA
adducts in PBL has been shown either to be positively correlated
with disease response in a number of cancers, including testicular,
breast, colon, lung, esophageal, and ovarian cancer (8–14), or with
the degree of myelosuppression in children with cancer receiving
cisplatin therapy (15), to be negatively correlated with disease
response in advanced germ cell cancer (16) or to not be associated
with disease response in patients with testicular, ovarian, or breast
cancer (12, 17, 18). Furthermore, a positive association has not only
been shown between platinum-DNA adducts in buccal cells and
disease response in a variety of cancers, including testicular, breast,
ovarian, and colon cancer (19), but also between platinum-DNA
adducts in buccal cells and better OS in non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC; ref. 20) and between platinum-DNA adducts in tumor
tissue and better progression-free survival (PFS) in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC; ref. 21).
Given the evidence that was available in 1997, the Gynecologic
Oncology Group (GOG) amended the randomized phase III trial it
was conducting at the time, GOG protocol 158 (GOG-0158), to
prospectively test the hypothesis that higher adduct levels are
associated with better clinical outcome in women with epithelial
ovarian cancer (EOC). Participants had previously untreated, stage
III, optimally debulked EOC and were randomized to paclitaxel and
either cisplatin or carboplatin. The end points in this trial included
the assessment of PFS and overall survival (OS). Second-look
laparotomy (SLL) was not required for this protocol, but was
allowed when declared at the time of protocol enrollment as an
option to assess disease status. Tumor response could not be
evaluated in this study because the participants in this trial were
not permitted to have residual tumor >1.0 cm following staging

repair (NER) is responsible for the repair of DNA damaged by
platinum agents, including cisplatin and carboplatin (24, 25).
Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) is an
excision nuclease that works in the repairosome responsible
for excision of the covalent bulky damage to the DNA, the ratelimiting step in the NER process (26, 27). Studies in a variety of
cancers including ovarian cancer have shown that ERCC1 expression correlates directly with resistance to platinum-based treatment,
and that high ERCC1 expression (mRNA or protein) in tumor tissue
was either associated with worse disease response, relapse-free
survival, or OS (28–32), associated with a reduced risk of death (33),
or was not associated with disease response (31, 33). More recently,
a polymorphism in codon 118 of ERCC1 was shown to be an
independent predictor of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer but
was not associated with OS (34). In a study of 783 individuals with
completely resected NSCLC, patients with ERCC1-negative tumors,
but not those with ERCC1-positive tumors, seemed to benefit from
adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy and experience prolonged
PFS as well as OS (35). Although platinum-DNA adducts in PBL have
been shown to be an effective surrogate for platinum-DNA adduct
assessments in tumor tissue (26), similar studies have yet to evaluate
whether or not ERCC1 in PBL is a surrogate for ERCC1 assessments
in tumor. ERCC1 expression was examined in RNA extracted from
the PBL used to measure platinum-DNA adduct levels. Tumor tissue
was not available from the women who participated in this protocol,
which precluded an evaluation of tumor expression of ERCC1.
Analyses were conducted to determine whether mRNA expression of
ERCC1 in PBL collected 20 to 28 h after starting the first cycle of
chemotherapy was associated with worse PFS and OS, and an
increased risk of finding disease during SLL.

Eligibility criteria. Women entered on the phase III treatment trial,
GOG-0158 from April 1, 1997, to January 26, 1998, were eligible to
participate in this translational research study. Participants were required
to have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of EOC, stage III (optimal with
V1 cm residual disease); an appropriate staging laparotomy with
cytoreduction; adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function; and
an initial GOG performance score of 0, 1, or 2. The eligibility criteria also

components of this trial were published in separate reports (22, 23).
Specifically, treatment with paclitaxel plus carboplatin was shown
to be less toxic, easier to administer, and not inferior when
compared with paclitaxel plus cisplatin chemotherapy in women
with optimally resected, stage III EOC (22), and the performance of
SLL did not seem to be associated with better survival (23).

required a suitable PBL (buffy-coat) specimen for testing, and written
informed consent consistent with all federal, state, and local requirements
to participate in the clinical and translational research components of this
protocol. Eligibility was further contingent upon histologic confirmation of

diagnosis by GOG Pathology Committee central review. The trial was done
in accordance with the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki, and annual
Institutional Review Board approval for this protocol was required for each
of the GOG participating institutions and the testing laboratory.
Stratification and treatment. Patients on GOG-0158 were stratified by
macroscopic residual disease status after their initial staging surgery, and a
declaration of whether a reassessment (second-look) laparotomy would be
done. Following enrollment on GOG-0158, women were randomly allocated
to receive six cycles of 135 mg/m2 i.v. paclitaxel over 24 h starting on day
1 every 21 days, followed by 75 mg/m2 i.v. cisplatin on day 2 every 21 days or
six cycles of 175 mg/m2 i.v. paclitaxel over 3 h on day 1 every 21 days, followed
by a carboplatin area-under-the-curve (AUC) 7.5 i.v. on day 1 every 21 days.
Specimen collection, shipping, and storage. The protocol required the
collection of a PBL (buffy-coat) specimen from each patient after initial
staging laparotomy with cytoreduction and 24 h post–initial platinum
infusion. In each case, f40 to 50 mL peripheral whole blood was collected
in a purple-top Vacutainer tube with EDTA, a green-top Vacutainer tube
with heparin, or a heparin syringe. The blood was drawn within 20 to 28 h of
starting the initial platinum infusion during cycle 1. Recovered PBL were
kept frozen less than 70jC during shipment to the GOG Tissue Bank and
then to Dr. Reed’s laboratory and storage before testing.

centrifugation and analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a
Perkin-Elmer Zeeman 3030 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer with
HGA 600 Graphite Furnace equipped with a platinum hallow cathode as
described by Reed et al. (36). Serial aqueous dilutions from a stock solution
of platinum (H2PtCl3H2O) were used to generate a standard curve for
comparison. The detection limit for this method is 10 fmol Pt/Ag DNA and
requires as little as 70 Ag of DNA for testing.
RNA extraction and quantitation of ERCC1 expression. Total cellular
RNA was extracted as previously described (37). cDNAs were generated using
oligodeoxy-TMP primers from 5 Ag total RNA per specimen. PCR was done
for 35 cycles with cDNAs and appropriate primers using AmpliTag DNA
polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). ERCC1 primers amplified a 239-bp segment
from 394 to 633 bp of the ERCC1 cDNA. Primers for h-actin amplified a
731-bp segment extending from 269 to 1,535 bp of the coding region of the
h-actin gene. Amplified DNAs were electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose
gel, transferred to a Hybond N+ membrane, hybridized to fluorescently
labeled probes for ERCC1 and h-actin, and visualized using an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system. ERCC1 expression was quantified
using the IPLab-Gel software (Scanalytics, Inc.), corrected based on h-actin
expression, and presented as relative expression as compared with a human
T-lymphocyte cell line control as reported previously (28, 29).
Statistical methods and end points. Biomarker and clinical data were
analyzed using SPSS version 10.0 and SAS version 9.0. Estimates of the

survival probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method (38);
the logrank test (39) was used to test the null hypothesis of equality in
survival distributions among patient groups categorized by platinum-DNA
adducts or ERCC1 expression. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional
hazards regression analyses (40) were done to model the association
between platinum-DNA adducts or corrected ERCC1 expression expressed
as continuous or categorized variables and either PFS or OS. The likelihood
ratio test was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of each of the overall Cox
models, and the Wald test was employed to assess the association between
the individual covariates and outcome. Patients were followed quarterly for
2 years, semiannually for the next 3 years, and then annually until death.
PFS was calculated as the time in months from enrollment on the GOG0158 to disease progression or death for noncensored events, or to the date
of last contact for censored events, that is, for patients alive with no
evidence of disease progression. OS was calculated as the time from
enrollment to death for noncensored events or to the date of last contact for
censored events, that is, for patients alive, regardless of disease status.
Cause of death was reported when available. As of August 23, 2006, 30
women were alive with no evidence of disease, 27 women were alive with
disease progression, and 113 women died. Among those who died, 91.4% of
the deaths were attributed to disease progression, whereas 1.9% of the
deaths were due to treatment, 2.9% were due to a cause other than disease
or treatment, and 3.8% were due to an unknown cause.

Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses (41) were
conducted to examine the association between platinum-DNA adducts
and the results of SSL. Disease status was classified as negative when there
was no evidence of disease or positive when microscopic or macroscopic
evidence of disease was observed during SLL.

Results
There were 316 women enrolled in GOG-0158 from April 1, 1997,
to study closure on January 26, 1998, that were eligible to
participate in this translational research study. Of these, there
were 23 treatment protocol exclusions, including wrong tumor site,
stage, or histologic subtype, EOC with low malignant potential, a
previous invasive malignancy, and inadequate or improper surgery.
There were an additional 93 cases that were excluded due to a
problem associated with obtaining a suitable buffy-coat specimen
for testing. Of these, the PBL (buffy-coat) specimen either was not
collected, was improperly prepared, was received in unsatisfactory
condition, or yielded insufficient DNA, poor-quality DNA, or
insufficient high-quality RNA for testing. There were 170 cases
with sufficient high-quality DNA and RNA for testing, and all
provided evaluable results.
Among the 170 women who were evaluated for both platinumDNA adducts and corrected ERCC1 expression, the median age at
enrollment was 58 years, 88% were Caucasian, 73% had serous
adenocarcinoma, 61% were poorly differentiated, and 61% had
macroscopic gross residual disease following optimal cytoreductive
surgery (Table 1). Detectable adducts were observed in 140 (82.4%)
women, and levels ranged from 0.43 to 131 fmol platinum/Ag DNA.
Adducts were not detected in 30 (17.6%) cases. ERCC1 expression
was detected in 132 (77.6%) women, and corrected levels ranged
from 0.01 to 2.75. ERCC1 expression was not detected in 38 (22.4%)
women. There was no evidence of a correlation between the level of
corrected ERCC1 expression and platinum-DNA adducts (Fig. 1).
In addition, categorized ERCC1 expression was not associated with
categorized platinum-DNA adducts (Table 2).
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to model the time to disease
progression or death in women categorized by the presence of
platinum-DNA adducts or ERCC1 expression (Fig. 2). A trend
suggesting a 4.8-month longer median PFS was observed in women
with detectable compared with undetectable platinum-DNA
adducts (P = 0.084; Fig. 2A). Moreover, median survival was 23.8
months longer in women with detectable compared with undetectable adducts (P = 0.029; Fig. 2B). In contrast, there was no
evidence to suggest a difference in PFS (P = 0.993; Fig. 2C) or OS (P =
0.809; Fig. 2D) in women exhibiting positive compared with negative
ERCC1 expression.
Unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression modeling was done to
determine whether platinum-DNA adduct level or corrected ERCC1
expression was associated with PFS or OS. When expressed as a
continuous variable, neither platinum-DNA adduct level nor
corrected ERCC1 expression was associated with a change in the
risk of disease progression or death (Table 3) in this cohort.
Unadjusted Cox regression modeling indicated a trend toward a
reduced risk of disease progression [hazard ratio (HR), 0.686; 95%
confidence interval (95% CI), 0.447–1.054; P = 0.086] and a 39%
reduction in the risk of death (95% CI, 0.385–0.958; P = 0.032) for
women with detectable compared with undetectable platinumDNA adducts. In contrast, positive compared with negative ERCC1
expression was not associated with an altered risk of disease
progression (HR, 0.978; 95% CI, 0.655–1.461; P = 0.915) or death
(HR, 1.026; 95% CI, 0.648–1.626; P = 0.912).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

Cox regression analyses were then done with adjustments for
clinicopathologic factors with prognostic and/or historical value in
this patient population, including patient age, performance status,
tumor grade, histologic subtype, residual disease status, and/or type
of chemotherapy. The purpose of the first approach was to develop
a reduced (parsimonious) Cox regression model for PFS or OS
(Table 3) using a stepwise method to limit the clinicopathologic
factors included in the model to those with prognostic value in this
patient cohort. Variable inclusion was set at 0.1, with variable
exclusion set at 0.15. The prognostic covariates were included
during the first step, and the two biomarkers were added during the
second step of model development. Residual disease status was the
only clinicopathologic factor that satisfied the selection criteria for
the reduced Cox regression model for PFS, whereas performance
status, tumor grade, histologic subtype, and residual disease status
were incorporated into the reduced model for OS. After adjusting
for prognostic factors, the presence of platinum-DNA adducts and
ERCC1 expression in peripheral leukocytes collected 20 to 28 h after
the initiation of first-line combination chemotherapy were not
independent predictors of PFS or OS in women with optimally
debulked, advanced EOC (Table 3). A full Cox regression model was
also developed with patient age, performance status, tumor grade,
histologic subtype, residual disease status, and type of chemotherapy entered during the first step and both platinum-DNA adducts
and corrected ERCC1 added during the second step. Similar results
were obtained after adjusting for the full set of clinicopathologic
factors. Neither categorized platinum-DNA adducts nor corrected
ERCC1 expression added prognostic value to the full adjusted Cox
regression model for PFS or OS (data not shown).
SLL was not required for this protocol, but was allowed when
declared at the time of protocol enrollment as an option to assess
disease status. Of the 170 women in this cohort, 75 elected to
undergo SLL at enrollment. Ten women refused to undergo the
procedure, and another five experienced disease progression before
the scheduled SLL. Of the 60 women who underwent SLL, 34 (56.7%)
showed no evidence of disease, and 26 (43.3%) exhibited microscopic or macroscopic evidence of disease. Unadjusted and adjusted
logistic regression analyses were done to examine the association
between platinum-DNA adducts or ERCC1 expression in PBL
collected 20 to 28 h after starting cycle 1 of chemotherapy and the
results of SLL. This modeling revealed that neither the level nor the
presence of either platinum-DNA adducts or corrected ERCC1 expression was associated with a significant change in the estimated
odds of observing evidence of disease during SLL as the confidence
intervals surrounding these odds ratios overlapped 1.0 (Table 4).

Discussion
This is the first prospective study to evaluate the relationship
between platinum-DNA adducts and either PFS or OS in a large
cohort of women with ovarian cancer. This study was incorporated
into a phase III treatment trial (GOG-0158; refs. 22, 23), and
participants were enrolled by 32 parent and 48 affiliate GOG
institutions. Platinum-DNA adducts were assessed in peripheral
leukocytes 20 to 28 h post–initial infusion of the platinum agent
during cycle 1 of chemotherapy using atomic absorbance
spectroscopy. The participants had previously untreated, optimally
debulked, stage III EOC and were randomized to chemotherapy
with paclitaxel and cisplatin or paclitaxel and carboplatin. Women
were required to have <1.0 cm of residual disease following surgical
staging with cytoreduction, and as such, tumor response was not

an end point in this trial. Previous studies evaluated the
relationship between platinum-DNA adducts in peripheral leukocytes and disease response but not PFS or OS in a variety of cancers
including ovarian cancer (8–14, 16–18) or between platinum-DNA
adducts in either buccal cells or tumor and disease response in
a variety of cancers (19), OS in NSCLC (20), or with PFS and OS
in HNSCC (21). In these studies, platinum-DNA adducts were
assessed using an ELISA (8–12, 14) atomic absorbance spectroscopy (12–14, 16, 17), inductively coupled plasma–mass spectroscopy (18), immunocytochemistry (19, 20), or 32P postlabeling (21).
This study showed that the presence of platinum-DNA adducts
in PBL 20 to 28 h after the first cycle of chemotherapy was
associated with better OS, but not with PFS or the results of SLL.
After adjusting for clinicopathologic factors, detectable compared
with undetectable platinum-DNA adducts was not an independent
predictor of clinical outcome in women with optimally debulked
stage III EOC treated with platinum-taxane–based chemotherapy.
When expressed as a continuous variable, the levels of platinumDNA adducts was not associated with PFS, OS, or the results of SLL
in this cohort. In contrast, the level of platinum-DNA adducts in
buccal cells was shown to be an independent predictor of better OS
in NSCLC (20), and the level of platinum-DNA adducts in tumor
tissue was shown to be an independent predictor of better PFS but
not OS in HNSCC (21). A number of differences exist between these
studies that likely contribute, at least in part, to the disparity in
results, including the patient population (EOC versus NSCLC
versus HNSCC), method for detecting platinum-DNA adducts

(atomic absorbance spectroscopy versus immunocytochemistry
assay versus 32P postlabeling), type of sample (PBL versus buccal
cells versus tumor tissue), time point for specimen collection (20 to
28 h after the start of the first cycle versus 1 h after the fifth cycle
versus 23 h after the end of the first cycle), sample size (170 cases
versus 27 cases versus 35 cases), and the type of treatment
(paclitaxel plus cisplatin or carboplatin versus concurrent cisplatin
radiation versus concurrent cisplatin radiation) in that described
herein by van de Vaart et al. and by Hoebers et al., respectively.
Although tumor response was not an end point in the study
reported herein, SLL was allowed when declared at the time of
protocol enrollment and provided an opportunity to evaluate
disease status in this population with optimally debulked stage III
EOC. There was no apparent evidence to suggest an association
between either the level or the presence of platinum-DNA adducts
and the estimated odds of observing evidence of disease during
SLL. Based on the limited sample size for this assessment, this
study was only powered to detect a rather large change in the
estimated odds of observing evidence of disease during SLL. A
larger study is therefore needed to definitively evaluate whether or
not a relationship exists between platinum-DNA adduct levels and
disease status following primary treatment with paclitaxel plus
cisplatin or carboplatin in women with optimally debulked stage
III EOC. Previous studies in a variety of cancers including ovarian
cancer have shown a positive relationship between platinum-DNA
adducts and disease response (8–14), no association between
platinum-DNA adducts and disease response (12, 17, 18), or an

inverse relationship between adducts and disease response (16).
Based on these contradictory findings, a large prospective study is
still needed in cancer patients with measurable disease treated
with platinum-based therapy, including ovarian cancer, to
definitively determine whether platinum-DNA adduct levels in
peripheral leukocytes are significantly associated with disease
response.
A number of studies have evaluated the relationship between
tumor expression ERCC1 and disease response, relapse-free survival
or OS in ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, and colon cancer (28–33).
The present study evaluated whether mRNA expression of ERCC1 in
PBL collected 20 to 28 h after starting the first cycle of chemotherapy
is associated with worse PFS and OS and an increased risk of finding
disease during SLL. High ERCC1 expression (mRNA or protein) in
tumor tissue was previously shown to be associated with resistance
to platinum-based therapy (28–30, 32) or to not be associated with
disease response (31, 33). In addition, the high expression of ERCC1
in tumor has been shown to be associated with shorter survival
(30, 31) and a reduced risk of death (33). The study reported herein
showed that neither the level nor the presence of ERCC1 in RNA
extracted from PBL collected 20 to 28 h after starting the first cycle
of chemotherapy was associated with worse PFS and OS, or an
increased risk of finding disease during SLL. Unfortunately, tumor
tissue was not available from the women who participated in this
clinical trial, and it was not possible to determine whether or not
ERCC1 in PBL is a surrogate for ERCC1 in tumor tissue.
This study of molecular correlates of clinical outcome in EOC
was conducted in the setting of a prospective randomized clinical
trial. The data generated for ERCC1 mRNA levels suggest that
leukocytes cannot be used to obtain clinically relevant information on ERCC1 mRNA in this setting. This is in contrast to studies
of ERCC1 mRNA in tumor tissues (28–32, 35). We did not assess
leukocytes for genomic polymorphisms such as ERCC1 codon 118,
which has been associated with platinum sensitivity in lung
cancer (42), colon cancer (43), and ovarian cancer (34). The data
generated in this study for platinum-DNA adduct are consistent

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

with previously published data in ovarian cancer (8, 9, 11, 12); in
some studies of testicular cancer (8, 10); and in studies where
platinum was used as the only chemotherapy (11, 13). As
suggested in earlier studies, these data suggest that platinumDNA adduct may go up or down concurrently in leukocytes and
in malignant tissues in the same individuals. In addition, the
positive correlation between adduct level and clinical outcome
provides molecular support for the long-held clinical observation
that platinum compounds may constitute the mainstay of
treatment in EOC.
