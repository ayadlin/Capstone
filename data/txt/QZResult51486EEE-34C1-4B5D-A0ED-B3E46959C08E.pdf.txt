ABSTRACT
Doxazosin is an α1 adrenergic receptor blocker that also exerts antitumor effects.
However, the underlying mechanisms by which it modulates PI3K/Akt intracellular
signaling are poorly understood. In this study, we reveal that doxazosin functions as
a novel antiangiogenic agent by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)induced cell migration and proliferation. It also inhibited VEGF-induced capillarylike structure tube formation in vitro. Doxazosin inhibited the phosphorylation
of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and downstream signaling, including PI3K, Akt,
3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α). However, it had no effect
on VEGF-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation.
Furthermore, doxazosin reduced tumor growth and suppressed tumor vascularization
in a xenograft human ovarian cancer model. These results provide evidence that
doxazosin functions in the endothelial cell system to modulate angiogenesis by
inhibiting Akt and mTOR phosphorylation and interacting with VEGFR-2.

INTRODUCTION

factor (FGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β),
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF is
a major modulator of endothelial cell function, such as
blood vessel formation during embryonic development,
and plays a vital role in the proliferation, migration, and
invasion of vascular endothelial cells [3]. Angiogenesis
is initiated by growth factors such as VEGF and is a
potential treatment for vascular injuries [4-6]. During
cancer, endothelial cell activity plays an essential
role in modulating various vascular physiological and
pathological functions. Although VEGF receptor 1
(VEGFR-1) and VEGFR-2 are structurally very similar,
they have different biological roles. For example,

Angiogenesis is an important but complex process
that occurs during endothelial cell development, growth,
and movement, as well as wound healing and endothelial
cell-mediated degradation of the extracellular matrix.
Multistep angiogenesis is vital for cell division and
metastasis in most solid tumors. Angiogenesis, the
constitution of new blood vessels forming from preexisting vessels, occurs during embryonic development
as well as invasive tumor growth and tumor pathogenesis
[1, 2]. Angiogenesis is activated by various signaling
molecules and growth factors, including fibroblast growth

RESULTS

VEGFR-1 negatively regulates embryonic vasculogenesis
and stimulates tumor angiogenesis by activating
macrophages, whereas VEGFR-2 is predominantly
responsible for both tumor angiogenesis and embryonic
vasculogenesis [7-10]. VEGFR-2 also plays a pivotal
role in the activation of downstream components that
are responsible for proliferation, including endothelial
cell invasion, migration, differentiation, and embryonic
angiogenesis [11-13]; in contrast, VEGFR-1 has no role
in endothelial cell proliferation [14].
Doxazosin
(1-[4-amino-6,7-dimethoxy-2quinazolinyl]-4-[1,4-benzodioxan-2-ylcarbonyl]
piperazine methanesulfonate), a quinazoline compound,
functions as an α1 adrenergic receptor blocker [15]. It is
used to treat patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, a
noncancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, because
α1-blockers relax the smooth muscles surrounding the
prostate, easing urine flow and decreasing bladder outlet
obstruction [16, 17]. Some previous studies also reported
that α1-adrenoceptor antagonists stimulate apoptotic cell
death via TGF-β1 signaling and the activation of clear
factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells
inhibitor-alpha (IκBα) in prostate tumor cells [16, 18].
Doxazosin also stimulates apoptotic cell death in response
to abnormal cell-matrix interactions [19]. In a recent study,
Garrison and Kyprianou reported that specific caspase-8
inhibitors could block doxazosin-induced apoptotic cell
death in benign prostate cells (BPH) [20]. Caspase-8 is
activated by its interaction with Fas-associated death
domain (FADD) and their subsequent recruitment by
Fas ligand. Nevertheless, the biological roles of these
doxazosin-regulated processes, as well as molecular
mechanism behind the antiangiogenic effects of doxazosin,
remain poorly understood. Endothelial cells play a vital
role in regulating various vascular biological effects and
related diseases, including tumor growth and maintenance.
However, the effects of doxazosin in endothelial cells
during ovarian tumor growth are unknown.
Most studies on angiogenesis have focused on
endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and capillarylike tubule formation. In the current study, we investigated
the antiangiogenic effects of doxazosin in tumors using
in vitro human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC)
and in vivo mouse model systems. We also identified the
molecular pathways responsible for Akt- and mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent endothelial cell
growth during tumorigenesis. Doxazosin inhibited the
phosphorylation of signaling modulators downstream
of phosphatidylinositol-3’-kinase (PI3K) including Akt,
phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1),
and mTOR by interacting directly with VEGFR-2.
Therefore, this interaction results in potent antiangiogenic
and antitumor effects. The current findings suggest
that doxazosin plays a vital role in regulating cellular
angiogenesis.

Doxazosin suppresses VEGF-induced cell
migration, proliferation, and capillary-like tubule
formation significantly in HUVECs
The migration of endothelial cells is essential during
angiogenesis. Therefore, we explored whether doxazosin
modulated the effects of VEGF on cell migration using a
modified Boyden Transwell chamber system in HUVECs.
As expected, VEGF promoted the migration of doxazosintreated cells compared to control cells. Doxazosin
inhibited migration in a dose-dependent manner, and the
maximal effect was seen at a concentration of 20 µM (Fig.
1A). No migration was observed after 24 h of treatment
with increasing concentrations (0-25 µM) of doxazosin
(data not shown). These results suggest that VEGFstimulated endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis
might be inhibited specifically by doxazosin.
The in vitro antiangiogenic activity of doxazosin
was analyzed by assessing its effects on the VEGFstimulated proliferation of endothelial cells using [3H]
thymidine incorporation. Doxazosin inhibited VEGFinduced HUVEC DNA synthesis significantly (Fig. 1B).
This antiproliferative effect was not due to the cytotoxicity
of doxazosin in endothelial cells, since doxazosin had
no effect on the viability of HUVECs, as assessed
using Trypan Blue exclusion (data not shown). These
results suggest that doxazosin regulates angiostasis and
potently inhibits VEGF-induced pivotal events during
angiogenesis, including endothelial cell proliferation and
migration in vitro.
We next assessed the antiangiogenic effects of
doxazosin on VEGF-induced capillary-like tubule
formation using HUVECs grown on Matrigel in vitro.
As shown in Fig. 1C, treatment with VEGF increased
the formation of extended, strong capillary-like tubular
structures compared with control cells. In contrast,
doxazosin treatment abrogated VEGF-induced capillarylike tubule formation. Collectively, these results strongly
suggest that doxazosin specifically regulates VEGFinduced angiogenesis in vitro.

Doxazosin
suppresses
PI3K
and
Akt
phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent
manner
PI3K/Akt signaling plays a key role during tumor
angiogenesis. Therefore, we evaluated whether doxazosin
decreased the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt in SKOV3 and OVCAR-3 (data not shown) ovarian carcinoma
cells. Lysates from SKOV-3 cells treated with various
concentrations (0-25 μM) of doxazosin were analyzed by
4936

Western blotting, which revealed that VEGF induced the
phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt. As shown in Fig. 2A,
the activity of PI3K treated with various concentrations
of doxazosin inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, the
maximum effect was observed with 20 µM. Consistent
with this result, 20 µM doxazosin also decreased
PI3K phosphorylation significantly. Akt is an essential
downstream component of PI3K signaling. As expected,
doxazosin gradually reduced Akt phosphorylation in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Similarly, doxazosin
also lowered Akt phosphorylation in HUVECs (data not
shown). Collectively, these results suggest that PI3K/Aktdependent signaling cascades play important roles in the
effects of doxazosin in endothelial cells. The magnitude
of the observed effects was comparable to those exerted
by well-known PI3K and mTOR inhibitors such as
wortmannin and rapamycin, respectively.
In addition to Akt, doxazosin also decreased the
phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) (Tyr37/46) (Fig. 2C) and
PDK1 (Ser241) (Fig. 2D), one of the best-characterized
targets of mTOR. When cells were co-treated with
doxazosin and rapamycin, p-4E-BP1 was inactivated.
These results provide evidence to support our hypothesis
that doxazosin inhibits PI3K/Akt activity.
We next assessed the effects of doxazosin on

downstream mediators of the PI3K/Akt pathways.
Doxazosin dramatically diminished the phosphorylation of
mTOR at Ser-2448 and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K)
at Thr-421 (Fig. 2D). Therefore, we next determined
whether doxazosin led to VEGF-induced activation of the
Akt/PDK1/mTOR complex. As shown in Fig. 3, doxazosin
decreased the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt
(Ser-473 and Thr-308), PDK1 (Ser-241), and mTOR
(Ser-2448), but had no effect on the phosphorylation of
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). These
results strongly suggest that doxazosin decreases VEGFdependent Akt, PDK1, and mTOR phosphorylation.
PI3K/Akt signaling not only mediates VEGFinduced cell proliferation and migration, but also the
expression of VEGF and HIF-1α [17]. Consistent with
these findings, doxazosin treatment abrogated VEGF and
HIF-1α expression completely. These results suggest that
VEGF-induced protein activation is inhibited specifically
by doxazosin in HUVECs (left panel) and ovarian
carcinoma cells (right panel) (Fig. 4). Collectively,
these observations suggest that doxazosin inhibits the
autocrine effects of VEGF in endothelial cells, exerts
direct antiangiogenic effects, and inhibits tumor growth
and metastasis.

We next determined whether doxazosin has direct
effects on angiogenesis and tumor cell growth in vivo.
SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells were injected subcutaneously
into nude mice (10/group), and the tumors were allowed
to grow for 12 days until they reached a mean volume
of 100 mm3. The mice were treated orally with control
or doxazosin, and tumor growth and morphology was
evaluated every 3 days for 24 days. Doxazosin-treated
tumors weighed ~75% less than those from control mice
(Fig. 6A, left panel).
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed that
tumors in the control group were high-grade carcinoma
with an irregular cell distribution. In contrast, doxazosintreated tumors exhibited large areas of late-apoptotic or
necrotic cells (Fig. 6A, right panel). In addition, tumors
treated with doxazosin had significantly reduced cell
proliferation and enhanced apoptotic cell death, as
determined by immunohistochemistry for PCNA and
PARP, respectively (Fig. 6B). Moreover, anti-CD31
(PECAM-1) staining in the endothelial cells of doxazosintreated mice revealed a ~2.5-fold reduced number of
blood vessels compared to the control (Fig. 6C). These

We next assessed the effect of doxazosin on VEGFinduced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in SKOV-3 cells and
HUVECs (data not shown) to assess the biological and
functional relevance of the direct relationship between
VEGFR-2 and doxazosin. VEGFR-2 is a key signal
transducer during VEGF-induced endothelial cell vascular
development and pathological angiogenesis. As shown in
Fig. 5A, treatment with doxazosin suppressed VEGFinduced VEGFR-2 phosphorylation in SKOV-3 carcinoma
cells. The effect of doxazosin on VEGFR-2 transcription
was then evaluated using a luciferase reporter assay
system and a construct containing the VEGFR-2 promoter
fused to luciferase. Luciferase activity decreased in
response to treatment with doxazosin in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 5B), suggesting that doxazosin regulates
VEGFR-2 activity. These results suggest that treatment
with doxazosin decreases VEGFR-2 transcriptional
activity.

with tumor progression and a poor prognosis [18-21].
However, the current study revealed that doxazosin could
decrease both HIF-1α and VEGF expression during
angiogenesis (Figs. 2D and 4). Treatment with doxazosin
also suppressed VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation
significantly compared to the VEGF-treated control
(Fig. 1A). Subsequently, we confirmed that doxazosin
dramatically reduced the phosphorylation of PI3K and
mTOR, as well as VEGFR-2 protein expression (Figs.
2A, 2D, and 5A). These results clearly suggest that
doxazosin inhibits endothelial cell angiogenesis during
tumorigenesis.
PI3K/Akt signaling plays a vital role in the
biological functions of human malignant tumors. Recent
studies have reported that suppressing PI3K might be
beneficial to inhibit tumor angiogenesis [17, 22-24]. PI3K
also regulates the signaling pathways that are involved in
cell growth and/or apoptotic cell death [21]. Therefore,
the anti-apoptotic events that are modulated by Akt begin
with PI3K. Akt is activated by PI3K, which recruits Akt
to the cell membrane and allows its phosphorylation by
PDK1 [25]. The current study revealed that doxazosin
decreased the phosphorylation of both PDK1 and Akt
(Fig. 2). In addition, doxazosin downregulated the VEGFinduced phosphorylation of the mTOR signaling mediators

DISCUSSION
In this study, we identified a novel biological
function of doxazosin as a powerful antiangiogenic
modulator that functions via the Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway. Quinazoline-derived α1-adrenoceptor antagonists
exert anticancer activity in prostate cancer. In addition,
the induction of apoptotic cell death and inhibition of
angiogenesis by doxazosin have been reported widely [1216]. Nevertheless, its precise molecular effects have not
yet been reported in ovarian cancer. The phosphorylation
of VEGFR-2 plays an important role in promoting VEGFinduced tumor angiogenesis. During cancer progression,
angiogenesis is typically regulated by two key factors:
VEGF, and HIF transcription factors. HIF proteins
commonly enhance the expression of VEGF, whereas HIF1α expression is enhanced during hypoxia [12]. Activated
HIF-1α promotes the proliferation, migration, and
invasion of endothelial cells, as well as tube formation in
malignant cancer. The upregulation of VEGF is commonly
seen in most aggressive solid tumors, including ovarian,
colon, lung, and uterine tumors; it is closely associated

p70S6K and 4E-BP1. In contrast, VEGF-induced ERK1/2
phosphorylation was unaffected by doxazosin (Fig. 3).
Collectively, these results suggest that doxazosin could
block VEGFR-2 transcriptional activity by suppressing
VEGFR-2 phosphorylation via VEGF-dependent Akt/
mTOR signaling.
In summary, our data demonstrate that doxazosin
could suppress endothelial cell functions, including cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and capillary-like tubule
formation, by suppressing VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and
inhibiting Akt/mTOR signaling. It also suppresses the
expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in ovarian carcinoma
cells. These data supply additional evidence to support a
role for doxazosin as a potent modulator of the biological
and physiological mechanisms relevant to angiogenesis.
The potential of doxazosin as an ovarian cancer treatment
should be assessed in future studies.

were rinsed twice with M199 and then incubated in M199
containing 1% FBS for 6 h. Cells were first incubated
with doxazosin, and were then induced with VEGF (10
ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 24 h in
M199 containing 1% FBS. [3H]-Thymidine (0.5 µCi/ml;
Amersham, Arlington, IL) was added 4 h prior to analysis.
High-molecular-mass compounds with [3H]-radioactivity
were then precipitated using 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1
h at 4°C. Cells were solubilized in 0.2 N NaOH containing
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and [3H] thymidine
incorporation was calculated using a liquid scintillation
counter (Beckman Coulter, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Cell migration analysis
Twenty-four well Transwell chambers (8.0 μm
pore size; Costar, New York, NY) were used to assay
migration and invasion [26, 27]. For migration analyses,
the lower surface of a filter was coated with 10 µg/ml of
gelatin overnight. M199 containing 1% FBS and 10 ng/ml
VEGF was added to the lower wells. Cells were harvested
by trypsinization and washed. Next, 1.3 × 105 cells were
resuspended in 100 μl of fresh DMEM, added to the upper
chamber, and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Cells that had
migrated to the lower chamber were fixed with methanol,
and stained with 10 mg/ml H&E. Cells that remained on
the surface of the upper filter were removed by wiping
with a cotton swab. Cell migration was then quantified by
counting the number of stained cells in five random areas
of each membrane.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, chemical, and antibodies
Human ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV-3 and
OVCAR-3) were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). They were
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM;
Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin/
streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.
Primary HUVECs (Clonetics, San Diego, CA) were grown
on 0.3% gelatin-coated dishes (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) in EGM-2 BulletKit medium (Clonetics). Rapamycin
was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
MA). Doxazosin and all other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. The following primary antibodies
were used: anti-phospho-VEGFR-2 (Y1175), antiVEGFR-2, anti-phospho-PI3K, anti-PI3K, anti-phosphoAkt, anti-Akt, anti-HIF-1α, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, antiERK1/2 (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA), anti-phospho-PDK1, anti-PDK1, anti-phospho-4EBP1, anti-4E-BP1, anti-phospho-mTOR, anti-mTOR,
anti-phospho-p70S6K, anti-p70S6K, PCNA, cyclin D1,
survivin (all from Cell Signaling Technology), antiCD31 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-VEGF165 (Ab-1;
Oncogene, Cambridge, MA), and anti-β-actin (SigmaAldrich).

In vitro tube formation assay
Growth factor-reduced Matrigel was added to a
24-well plate and polymerized for 30 min at 37°C [27].
Untreated, mock-treated, or doxazosin-treated HUVECs
(3.3 × 105 cells/well) were then added to the surface of the
Matrigel. The seeded cells were incubated for 48 h with or
without 10 ng/ml of VEGF in M199 containing 1% FBS.
Images were then captured at 40× magnification after
washing. The length of the formed tubes was measured
using an inverted microscope equipped with a digital CCD
camera and ImageLab software (MCM Design, Hillerød,
Denmark). The control sample (VEGF-induced control)
was defined as 100% tube formation, and the percent
increase or decrease in tube formation relative to the
control was measured for each sample.

the removal of insoluble materials by centrifugation, the

performed using an Axiophot 2 apparatus (Carl Zeiss
MicroImaging Inc., Thornwood, NY).

Statistical analysis
Results were analyzed statistically using Student’s

Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer supplied with protease inhibitors. The
concentration of protein samples was then evaluated
using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 8-12%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels
and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking, the membranes
were incubated at room temperature with primary
antibodies for 1 h. They were then rinsed three times in
wash buffer, followed by incubation with the appropriate
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary
antibodies. The protein bands were developed using an
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system.

Tumor samples were collected from mouse
xenografts and fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin
(Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were then stained using H&E
(Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For immunoblotting, protein lysates were
prepared by homogenizing the frozen tumor tissues.
Protein quantitation and immunoblotting were then
performed as described above with 30-μg protein/
sample. For immunohistochemistry, paraffin-embedded
ovarian tumor tissues were serially sectioned into 5-µm
slices. The prepared slides were then deparaffinized,
rehydrated in xylene and graded alcohols, and then rinsed
in PBS. The slides were also incubated in 5% hydrogen
peroxide in methanol for 20 min to block endogenous
peroxidase activity. Sections were incubated with a
saturating concentration of anti-mouse CD31 (plateletderived endothelial cell adhesion molecule; PECAM-1)
(Abcam) antibody overnight at 4°C, followed by a
streptavidin-peroxidase complex at room temperature
