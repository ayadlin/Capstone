Abstract
Treating bone cancer pain continues to be a clinical challenge and underlying mechanisms of bone cancer pain
remain elusive. Here, we report that EphB1 receptor forward signaling in the spinal cord is critical to the
development of bone cancer pain and morphine tolerance in treating bone cancer pain. Tibia bone cavity tumor
cell implantation (TCI) produces bone cancer–related thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia, spontaneous
and movement-evoked pain behaviors, and bone destruction. Production and persistence of these pain behaviors
are well correlated with TCI-induced upregulation of EphB1 receptor and its ligand ephrinB2 in the dorsal horn
and primary sensory neurons. Spinal administration of an EphB1 receptor blocking reagent EphB2-Fc prevents
and reverses bone cancer pain behaviors and the associated induction of c-Fos and activation of astrocytes and
microglial cells, NR1 and NR2B receptors, Src within the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex, and the
subsequent Ca2þ-dependent signals. The exogenous ligand ephrinB2-Fc upregulates level of phosphorylation of
NR1 and NR2B receptors depending on the activation of EphB1 receptor. Spinal administration of EphB2-Fc and
ephrinB2-Fc induces downregulation of EphB1 and ephrinB2, respectively, accompanied with increased activity of
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9. Blocking MMP-2 or MMP-9 reverses EphB1-Fc treatment–induced downregulation of EphB1 receptor. In addition, spinal blocking or targeted mutation of EphB1 receptor reverses
morphine tolerance in treating bone cancer pain in rats and defensive pain in mice. These findings show a critical
mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of bone cancer pain and suggest a potential target for treating bone
cancer pain and improving analgesic effect of morphine clinically. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4392–402. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Bone cancer pain is one of the most common symptoms
presented by patients with primary bone sarcomas and predominantly occurs as distant metastases of non-bone primary
tumors, notably those in breast, prostate, and lung (1, 2).
Tumor cells act to cause pain in many ways. Production of
prostaglandin and other molecules by tumors, tumorAuthors' Affiliations: 1Departments of Neurobiology, Parker University

associated macrophages, and other host cells stimulate osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Nociceptors in bone are
stimulated via activation of transient receptors potential
vanilloid type-1, endothelin A, and TrkA receptor. Activation
is directed by acid microenvironment, endothelin-1, and nerve
growth factor, respectively (2). Mechanisms of bone cancer
pain are complex and may involve a combination of inflammatory and neuropathic pain (2, 3) with unique characteristics. For instance, bone cancer pain markedly increases
expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; ref. 4),
but not substance P and calcitonin gene–regulated peptide
(CGRP) in the dorsal horn (DH) of the spinal cord or galanin
and neuropeptides Y in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons
(2). Despite decades of thorough study, the specific cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying bone cancer pain
remain elusive and the clinical approaches for treating bone
cancer pain are limited.
Eph receptors, named for its expression in an erythropoietinproducing human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, consist
of the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which play
vital roles in transmitting external signals to the interior of
many types of cells. EphB receptors and their ligands ephrinBs
are critical cues in regulating cell shape, adhesion/repulsion,
migration, and positioning during developmental processes
(5–7). Alteration of mechanisms controlling adhesion and

EphB1 Receptor Is Critical to Bone Cancer Pain

motility has a central role in promoting tumor invasion and
angiogenesis (8–10). Altered expression of ephrins and/or
Eph receptors has been implicated in tumor progression in a
number of human malignancies (11–13). Recently, we have
found that ephrinB–EphB receptor signaling is involved in
pain after nerve injury or opiate withdrawal (14–16). We
hypothesized that the ephrinB–EphB receptor signaling
might play an important yet unknown role in development
of bone cancer pain. EphrinB–EphB interaction is well
known to lead bidirectional signals, the forward and the
reverse signaling (17). There is no clear evidence if either the
forward or the reverse signaling or both is necessary for
production and/or persistence of any pain status. Here, we
show that the forward but not the reverse signaling of EphB1
receptor in the spinal cord is critical to development of bone
cancer pain. Spinal inhibition of EphB1 receptor can relieve
bone cancer pain and rescue analgesic effect of morphine in
treating bone cancer pain.

Materials and Methods
Animals, anesthesia, drugs, and administration
All animals were used in accordance with the regulations of
the ethics committee of the International Association for the
Study of Pain and all protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees. Adult, male, and SpragueDawley rats; adult, male, and female CD-1 mice (Charles River
Laboratories); and the EphB1/ and EphB1þ/þ mice (Henkemeyer Laboratory at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center, Dallas, Texas) were used in this study. All
surgeries were done under anesthesia with pentobarbital
[Sigma, 50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)]. An EphB1 receptor
blocking reagent EphB2-Fc and an EphB1 receptor activator
ephrinB2-Fc were used to determine the possible roles of
EphB1 receptor in tumor cell implantation (TCI)-induced
pain–like behaviors and the associated neurochemical alterations. EphB2-Fc can combine with the endogenous ephrinBs,
and thus EphB1 is substituted and cleaved. This may result in
inhibition of the downstream signals of EphB1. EphrinB2-Fc
can combine with EphB1 receptor activate EphB1 receptor
and the downstream signals. Inhibitors for MMP-2 (matrix
metalloproteinase; MMP2i) and MMP-9 (FN439) were used to
determine possible roles of MMP-2/9 in modulation of EphB1.
Each of the drugs used was dissolved in PBS or dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and then injected intrathecally (i.t., 10 mL for
mice and 20 mL for rats) by means of lumbar puncture at the
intervertebral space of L4–5 and L5–6 for multiple injections.
These drugs and their final concentrations were: EphB2-Fc
(2 or 5 mg), ephrinB2-Fc (2 mg), FN439 (100 mg), MMP2i (10 mg),
DMSO (1%; Sigma-Aldrich), and immunoglobulin (Ig) G-Fc
(2 or 5 mg, Jackson Laboratories).
Model of bone cancer pain
Tumor cells were extracted from ascitic fluid of rats that
received Walker-256 rat mammary gland carcinoma cells. TCI
was mimicked by injecting the cells (1  105 cells/mL, 5 mL)
into the intramedullary space of the right tibia to induce bone
cancer in rats (18).

Assessment of bone cancer–related pain behaviors
Thermal hyperalgesia was determined by the significant
shortened latency of foot withdrawal in response to heat
stimulation. Mechanical allodynia was indicated by a significant decrease in the threshold of paw withdrawal to mechanical indentation of the plantar surface of each hindpaw. The
protocols were similar to those described previously (19, 20).
Western blotting
Protein precipitation procedures in conjunction with Western blots were employed to identify temporal expression of
EphB1, ephrinB2 protein, and their phosphorylation. Protocols were similar to those described previously (14, 21). EphB1
and ephrinB2 were immunoprecipitated from 2 mg total
protein/mL tissue lysate by using an anti-EphB1 antibody
[2 mg; Santa Cruz Technology (SCT)] complex with protine Gagarose (Invitrogen) and wheat germ agglutinin linked to
agarose (Sigma), respectively. EphrinB2 and its phosphorylation were detected by anti-ephrinB2 (C20, SCT) and antiphosphotyrosine antibody PY99 (SCT), respectively (22). EphB1
and its phosphorylation were detected by anti-EphB1 antibody (Q20, SCT) and phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate
Biotechnology), respectively (23). NR2A immunoprecipitation
was done by anti-NR2A antibody followed by adsorption to
protein G-agarose. Whole-cell protein extracts lysates were
used to identify temporal expression of the phosphorylated
protein levels of NR1(pNR1), NR2B(pNR2B), Src(pSrc), extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK; pERK), CaMKII(pCaMKII), cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB;
pCREB), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH). The primary antibodies were used including
pNR1(Ser897), 1:800 (Millipore); pNR2B(Tyr1472), 1:300 (Chemicon); pSrc(Tyr418), 1:800 (Abcam); pERK1/2(Thr202/
Tyr204), 1:500; pCaMKII(Thr286), 1:1,000 (Cell Signaling Technology); GAPDH, 1:1,000 (Sigma); and GFAP and pCREB
(Ser133)(SCT). The filters were then developed by enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents (Perkinelmer) with secondary
antibodies (Chemicon). Data were analyzed with a Molecular
Imager (Gel DocTM XR, 170-8170) and the associated software
Quantity One-4.6.5 (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Immunohistochemistry
Sections of the spinal cord or DRG tissues were incubated
with polyclonal rabbit antibodies of anti-EphB1 (1:20) and
anti-ephrinB2 (1:20; SCT) and mouse monoclonal antineuronal nuclear protein (NeuN; 1:100; Alexa Fluor-488 conjugated,
MAB377X; Chemicon). Rabbit IgG (1:200; Vector Laboratories)
was used as an isotype control. Morphologic details were
examined with a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2, Germany). The protocols were similar to those described previously (14, 21).
Morphine tolerance tests
Each of CD-1, EphB1þ/þ, or EphB1/ mice were placed on a

55 C hot plate apparatus and the latency to lick a paw was
measured following s.c. morphine injection. Protocol for
testing acute tolerance (Mor100-10): the latency to lick a
paw was measured at 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 hours following the

second dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.) administrated 24 hours after the
first dose of morphine (100 mg/kg). Protocol for testing
chronic tolerance (Mor10): morphine (10 mg/kg) was injected
daily for 7 days, and the analgesic effect was measured 30
minutes after each injection. To examine the role of EphB
receptor in morphine tolerance, EphB2-Fc (2 mg, i.t.), or its Fc
control was administrated 30 minutes prior to the morphine
at 100 mg/kg in acute tolerance or each of the morphine
injection at 10 mg/kg in the chronic tolerance in CD-1 mice.
Statistical analyses
SPSS Rel 15 was used to conduct all the statistical analyses.
Alteration of expression of the proteins detected and the
behavioral responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli over
time among groups were tested with 1-way and 2-way ANOVA
with repeated measures followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests,
respectively. All data are presented as meansSEM. Statistical
results are considered significant if P < 0.05.

Results
Activity and distribution of EphB1 and ephrinB2 in the
spinal cord following TCI
Level of protein expression and phosphorylation of EphB1
receptor and its ligand ephrinB2 in the spinal cord was
increased significantly in a time-dependent manner after
TCI, whereas they were at low levels in naive rats (Fig. 1A
and B). Phosphorylation of EphB1 was slightly decreased on
the postoperative 21 days, but not altered during postoperative 3 to 14 days because ratio of EphB1 and pEphB1 was
remained the same. The increased EphB1 and ephrinB2
immunoreactivity was distributed predominately in the superficial DH ipsilateral to TCI (Fig. 1C). EphB1 immunoreactivity
was colocalized primarily with neurons (Fig. 1D) and astrocytes, while only a small amount with microglia (Supplementary Fig. S1A). EphrinB2 immunoreactivity was colocalized
primarily with neurons (Fig. 1D) and astrocytes, but not with

Blocking EphB1 receptor activation prevents and
suppresses behavioral and neurochemical signs of bone
cancer pain
Rats that received TCI exhibited thermal hyperalgesia and
mechanical allodynia (Fig. 2). They also exhibited spontaneous
pain manifested as guarding and movement-evoked pain
manifested as guarding, flinching, and reduced limb use
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Production and persistence of these
pain-related behaviors were greatly delayed and suppressed by
an EphB1 receptor inhibitor EphB2-Fc administrated (each
5 mg, i.t., once a day) at postoperative 3, 4, and 5 days (Fig. 2A
and C) and postoperative 7, 8, and 9 days (Fig. 2B and D and
Supplementary Fig. S2), respectively. Normal pain sensation
was not altered. In addition, TCI caused induction of c-Fos
and activation of astrocytes and microglial cell in the DH
ipsilateral to TCI. These alterations were inhibited by repetitive treatments with EphB2-Fc (Supplementary Fig. S3). These
results suggest that ephrinB–EphB receptor signaling may
play an important role in production and persistence of bone
cancer pain. In addition, pathological observations (X-ray and
hematoxylin-eosin staining) showed that bone destruction

ephrinB2 immunoreactivity was colocalized with peptidergic
CGRP, but not the nonpeptidergic IB4 fibers and cells (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D). These results show that TCI can
cause an upregulation of EphB1 and ephrinB2 expression in
the neurons and astrocytes within the DH; the ephrinB2 may
originate, at least partly, from the peptidergic CGRP-nociceptive neurons.

Blocking EphB1 receptor activation suppresses
TCI-induced increase of level of pNR1, pNR2B, pSrc,
pERK, pCaMKII, and pCREB in the spinal cord
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) have a welldeveloped role in neural plasticity and various pain states.
Src family kinases can enhance NMDAR function (24–26) and
ephrinB2 may activate NR2B receptor via Src during inflammatory hyperalgesia (27). TCI treatment significantly increased
levels of pNR1, pNR2B, pSrc (Tyr418; Fig. 3A), pERK, pCaMKII,
and pCREB (Fig. 3B). Timing patterns of upregulation of these
phosphorylated molecules were well matched with that of bone
cancer pain–related behaviors (see Fig. 2). Repetitive treatment
with EphB2-Fc (each 5 mg, i.t., once a day on postoperative 7, 8,
and 9 days, respectively) inhibited the expression of these
molecules (Fig. 3). Expression of pNR2A was neither altered
by TCI nor EphB2-Fc treatment (Fig. 3A). These results suggest
that TCI-induced activation of NR1 and NR2B receptors, Src,
and the subsequent Ca2þ-dependent signals may be secondary
to activation of the ephrinB–EphB receptor signaling.
EphB2-Fc inhibits TCI-induced increase in expression
of EphB1 but not ephrinB2
EphrinB–EphB interaction is well known to lead bidirectional signals, the forward and the reverse signaling (17). There
is no evidence if either the forward or the reverse signaling or
both are necessary for production and maintenance of any
pain status. Here, we showed that TCI-induced upregulation

Figure 3. Blocking EphB receptor activation suppresses TCI-induced upregulation of pNR1, pNR2B, pSrc(Tyr418), pERK1/2, pCaMKII, and pCREB
in the spinal cord. EphB2-Fc (5 mg, i.t., daily) was administrated at postoperative 7, 8, and 9 days, respectively. Four samples were included in each of pNR1,
pNR2B, and pSrc(Tyr418) groups and 3 in the other groups. *, P < 0.05 and **, P < 0.01 indicate significant differences compared to the control (Sham and

of expression of EphB1 receptor was cancelled by EphB2-Fc
(5 mg, i.t.) in a single dose on the postoperative 7 day (Fig. 4A)
or repetitive doses on postoperative 7, 8, and 9 days, respectively (Fig. 4B). Inhibition occurred within 2 hours and persisted for at least a week. EphB2-Fc treatment did not affect
TCI-induced increase of expression of ephrinB2 and PY99
(Fig. 4C). These results, together with those shown in Figure
3, indicate that EphB1 downregulation may contribute to
inhibition of pNR1, pNR2B, pSrc(Tyr418), pERK1/2, pCaMKII,
and pCREB and reduction of bone cancer pain behaviors
following EphB2-Fc treatment; whereas continuous activation
of ephrinB2 is unable to maintain activation of these signals
and the pain status.
EphrinB2-Fc activates NR1 and NR2B and induces
thermal hyperalgesia on the condition of EphB1
receptor activation in naive rats
Spinal administration of an exogenous EphB1 receptor
activator ephrinB2-Fc (2 mg) increased the level of pEphB1,
but not the overall receptor expression of EphB1 (Fig. 5A), and
upregulated levels of pNR1 and pNR2B (Fig. 5B). It also
decreased ephrinB2 expression, but not its phosphorylation
PY99, because the ratio ephrinB2/PY99 was maintained at
the same level (Supplementary Fig. S5A) and resulted in

thermal hypersensitivity (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Repetitive ephrinB2-Fc (2 mg, i.t., once a day for 3 consecutive days)
produced similar effects on phosphorylation or expression of
these molecules and thermal hypersensitivity (Supplementary Fig. S6). We further examined whether ephrinB2-Fc–
induced activation of NR1 and NR2B and thermal hypersensitivity would be dependent on activation of the EphB1
receptor. TCI-induced upregulation of EphB1 was inhibited
by EphB2-Fc treatment (see Fig. 4). In naive rats, EphB2-Fc
treatment (5 mg, for 3 consecutive days) greatly inhibited
expression of EphB1 and its phosphorylation (Fig. 5C).
Under this condition, ephrinB2-Fc (2 mg) failed to activate
or rescue EphB1 (Fig. 5C), NR1, and NR2B (Fig. 5D), but
continued to downregulate ephrinB2 (Supplementary
Fig. S7A). In addition, ephrinB2-Fc treatment caused thermal hypersensitivity in naive rats, but failed to do so when
coadministrated with EphB2-Fc (Supplementary Fig. S7B).
These results indicate that activation of EphB1 receptor is
required for ephrinB2-Fc to activate NR1 and NR2B and
further induce thermal hypersensitivity, suggesting that
EphB1 and NR1/2 activation is necessary for the development of thermal hyperalgesia. Downregulation of ephrinB2
is not sufficient or unnecessary for ephrinB2-Fc–induced
thermal hypersensitivity.

Inhibition of MMP-2 or MMP-9 activation prevents
EphB2-Fc–induced downregulation of EphB1 in naive
and TCI rats
Spinal administration of EphB2-Fc results in downregulation of EphB1 protein, in addition to inhibition of TCIinduced pain–like behaviors and neurochemical alterations.
Since EphB–ephrinB interactions can be broken by MMPs,
which cleaves EphB receptors (28–30), we examined possible
roles of spinal MMP-9/2 in EphB2-Fc–induced EphB1 downregulation. With EphB2-Fc administration, levels of EphB1
and pEphB1 were further downregulated from already low
levels in naive rats (Fig. 6A) and TCI rats, back to control
(Sham) levels from greatly increased levels (Fig. 6B), respectively. The EphB2-Fc–induced downregulation of EphB1 was
completely prevented by blocking MMP-2 with MMP2i (10
mg) or MMP-9 with FN439 (100 mg; Fig. 6A and B) and the level
of EphB1 was brought back to levels originally seen in (i) naive
and (ii) TCI (B), respectively. However, without EphB2-Fc
treatment, blocking MMP-2 or MMP-9 inhibited TCI-induced
upregulation of EphB1 and brought the upregulated EphB1
back to control (Sham) levels (Fig. 6C, left), while keeping
EphB1 at its physiological levels in naive rats (Fig. 6C, right).
Administration of exogenous MMP-2 or MMP-9 caused an
increase rather than a decline in the activation (phosphorylation) of EphB1 without altering the expression of EphB1
protein in naive rats (Fig. 6D, left) and did not significantly
alter increased levels of EphB1 in TCI rats (Fig. 6D, right).

MMP-2 was greatly increased following EphB2-Fc or
ephrinB2-Fc treatment (Supplementary Fig. S8). These
results indicate that MMP-2/9 have different roles, with
and without EphB2-Fc treatment, in the modulation of
EphB1. With EphB2-Fc treatment, they held EphB1 back to
the reference levels which are relatively low in naive rats and
greatly increased in TCI rats. Without EphB2-Fc treatment,
they may upregulate the EphB1 level.
Blocking EphB1 receptor activation rescues analgesic
effect of morphine in treating bone cancer pain
Morphine has been used in reducing cancer pain, particularly in advanced and terminal patients, but its tolerance
following repeated use has limited its clinical use. Given that
EphB1 receptor may be a potential target for treating bone
cancer pain, we extended our experiments to examine
whether morphine tolerance in treating bone cancer pain
would be involved in the activation of ephrinB–EphB signaling. Injection of morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c., twice a day, 12 hours
intervals) significantly suppressed thermal hyperalgesia in TCI
rats. Such an analgesic effect decreased and then disappeared
(tolerance) 6 to 7 days after repeated use of morphine (Fig. 7A).
Coadministration of EphB2-Fc at lower doses (each 2 mg
accompanied with morphine), which alone was not enough
to reduce the hyperalgesia, successfully rescued the analgesic
effect of morphine (prevented morphine tolerance) in treating
bone cancer hyperalgesia (Fig. 7A). Meanwhile, increased level
of phosphorylation and expression of EphB1 following TCI

and morphine treatment were inhibited by repetitive EphB2Fc treatment (Fig. 7B).
We further investigated the role of EphB1 receptor in
morphine tolerance by using standard protocols for testing
acute and chronic morphine tolerance in naive and EphB1
receptor knock out (EphB1/) mice. Both acute (Fig. 7C) and
chronic (Fig. 7D) morphine tolerance were reduced by coadministration of EphB2-Fc (each 2 mg, i.t.) with morphine or by
targeted mutation of EphB1. Meanwhile, acute (Supplementary Fig. S9A and B) and chronic (Supplementary Fig. S9C)
morphine treatment significantly increased the expression of
EphB1 and its phosphorylation, and this effect was inhibited
by EphB2-Fc (Supplementary Fig. S9B and C). These results
indicate that the EphB1 receptor is involved in development of
morphine tolerance.

Discussion
Our study reveals a critical role for the ephrinB–EphB
receptor signaling in bone cancer pain and morphine tolerance in treating bone cancer pain. TCI greatly activates spinal
ephrinB2–EphB1 receptor signaling, which then induces activation of NR1 and NR2B receptors and the downstream
pathways, resulting in bone cancer pain. EphB1 is required
for the production and persistence of bone cancer pain and
the functional link among the ephrinB–EphB receptor signaling, NR1 and NR2B receptors, and downstream responses.
Cleavage of EphB1 receptor may be mediated by MMP-2 and
MMP-9. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying
the pathogenesis of bone cancer pain. EphB1 receptor is also
required for the development of morphine tolerance. Thus,
EphB1 receptor may be a potential target for treating bone

cancer pain and reducing opioid tolerance in treating bone
cancer pain clinically.
EphB receptors and their ligands, ephrinBs, are critical cues
in regulating cell shape, adhesion/repulsion, migration, and
positioning during developmental processes (5–7, 31). Alteration of mechanisms controlling adhesion and motility has a
central role in promoting tumor invasion and angiogenesis (8–
10). Here, we show that TCI-induced activation of EphB1
receptor and its ligand ephrinB2 are well correlated with
the timing patterns of TCI-induced bone cancer pain behaviors. The increased EphB1 receptor and ephrinB2 are predominantly localized with neurons and some astrocytes in the
DH, an essential area for the generation and processing of pain
signals. EphrinB2 in the peripheral nociceptors may be transported and redistributed along the CGRP fibers, to the presynaptic membranes of their central terminals, where it
triggers a series of postsynaptic effects. EphB receptors regulate synaptic plasticity by interaction with NMDARs (32–34).
NMDARs have a well-developed role in neural plasticity and
various pain states. Within the NMDAR complex, the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src, provides dynamic gain control of
NMDAR function via balancing its activity with striatal
enriched tyrosine (24–27, 35). We also show that blocking
EphB1 receptor activation largely diminished TCI-induced
phosphorylation of NR1 and NR2B receptors, Src(Tyr418),
and subsequent activation of various Ca2þ-dependent signaling enzymes, CREB, induction of c-Fos, and bone cancer–
related pain behaviors. Therefore, we hypothesize that peripheral nerve damage due to cancer cell invasion leads to
upregulation of the presynaptic ephrinB2 ligand and postsynaptic EphB1 receptor molecules in primary neurons and
the DH. Such an increased expression of ephrinB–EphB

signaling then leads to postsynaptic EphB1 receptor forward
signaling clustering and reciprocal phosphorylation on multiple tyrosine residues (32, 36). Thus, downstream signaling
proteins containing SH2 domains, including Src family kinases
(36, 37), which are physically associated with EphB receptors
and NMDARs, and phosphorylate NMDARs on tyrosines (38)
may be recruited. This results in the subsequent activation of
Ca2þ-dependent signaling pathways and behavioral manifestations.
We noted the fact that ephrinB2-Fc treatment and TCIinduced thermal hyperalgesia may involve EphB1 receptor,
probably via 2 different mechanisms. EphrinB2-Fc treatment

www.aacrjournals.org

may induce true EphB1 receptor activation, because it does
not affect overall receptor expression, but increases the level
of phosphorylation of EphB1. EphrinB2-Fc treatment also
downregulates the expression of both ephrinB2 and PY99.
On the contrary, TCI induces an upregulation of both EphB1
and pEphB1, and ephrinB2 and PY99.
EphrinB–EphB interaction is well known to lead bidirectional signals which are propagated into the ephrinB-expressing cells (reverse signaling) and the EphB-expressing cells
(forward signaling). It is unknown if either of the forward or
reverse signaling or both are important in pain processing.
Our findings in this bone cancer model may support that

EphB1 receptor forward signaling is critical to the development and maintenance of pain and activation of NR1 and
NR2B receptors and subsequent Ca2þ-dependent signals.
When EphB1 is inhibited, pain behaviors and NMDARs activation are inhibited even though the ephrinB2 continues to be
active. When EphB1 receptor is activated, NMDARs are activated and pain is induced even though ephrinB2 is downregulated. A recent study, by deleting ephrinB2 in Nav1.8þ
nociceptive sensory neurons, indicates that presynaptic
ephrinB2 expression may play a role in regulating inflammatory pain and some types of neuropathic pain through the
regulation of synaptic plasticity in the DH (39).
Another interesting phenomenon is that EphB2-Fc treatment results in downregulation of EphB1 protein accompa-

nied with increased activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the
spinal cord. Such EphB1 downregulation can be prevented or
rescued by blocking MMP-2 or MMP-9. We hypothesize that
during EphB2-Fc treatment, EphB2-Fc combines with endogenous ephrinB2 and thus EphB1 is substituted and cleaved
(downregulation) mediated by MMP-2 and/or MMP-9. This
results in inhibition of the downstream signals of the EphB1.
In contrast, without EphB2-Fc treatment, exogenous
ephrinB2-Fc or TCI-induced increased ephrinB2 combines
with EphB1 and results in upregulation of EphB1 and activation of the downstream signals. In this process, neither
ephrinB2-Fc nor ephrinB2 causes downregulation of EphB1
although it induces activation of MMP-2 and MMP-9; thus,
blocking MMP-2 or MMP-9 does not cause downregulation of

EphB1 Receptor Is Critical to Bone Cancer Pain

EphB1. In summary, MMP-2/9 may mediate EphB1 cleavage
during EphB-Fc treatment and thus enhance the inhibitory
effect of EphB2-Fc on EphB1 signaling; whereas MMP-2/9
alone may activate rather than cleave EphB1. Interactions
between EphB1 and MMPs need to be further examined and
they are beyond the scope of this article.
Cancer pain posses a major challenge clinically. Opioid
drugs, with or without coanalgesics/adjuvant analgesics, are
used to treat moderate to severe pain. However, the effective
use of morphine as a treatment on such pain is limited by
morphine tolerance and concerns related to addiction and
opioid administration–associated severe, sometimes debilitating side effects (40–43). This study shows that pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of EphB1 receptor can
prevent morphine tolerance in treating bone cancer pain
and defensive pain, respectively. In addition, we have recently
found that inhibition of EphB1 receptor can prevent or largely

diminish morphine physical dependence (14). Thus, blocking
EphB1 receptor may be a potential pharmaceutical therapy
that cannot only relieve bone cancer pain, but also facilitate
the clinical utility of opioid drugs in treating bone cancer pain.
