ABSTRACT
The human sulfatase 1 (hSulf-1) gene encodes an endosulfatase that functions
to inhibit the heparin-binding growth factor signaling, including the basic fibroblast
growth factor (bFGF)-mediated pathway, by desulfating the cell surface heparan
sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). bFGF could stimulate cell cycle progression and inhibit
cell apoptosis, this biological effect can be reversed by hSulf-1. However, molecular
mechanisms have not been fully reported. In the current study, by reactivation of
hSulf-1 expression and function in the hSulf-1-negative hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) cell lines and HCC xenograft tumors, we found that hSulf-1 blocked the bFGF
effect on the promotion of cell cycle and inhibition of apoptosis. The bFGF-stimulated
activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
pathways was suppressed by hSulf-1, which led to a decreased expression of the
target genes Cyclin D1 and Survivin, then finally induced cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in HCC cells. Our data suggested that hSulf-1 may be a suitable target for
cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

rapamycin (mTOR), that are involved in cancer cell
survival via interactions with their specific receptors and
then maintain the malignant growth of tumors [9]. The
sulfation of N-acetylglucosamine residues of heparan
sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on cell surface mediates
the interaction or binding of growth factors and their
receptors [10], which is a critical link for the cascade
activation of signal pathways. The human sulfatase 1
(hSulf-1) is a heparin-degrading endosulfatase, which can
desulfate HSPGs and block the binding of growth factors
and their receptors, and finally inhibit the activation of
growth factor signaling pathways [11,12]. The expression
of hSulf-1 protein is positive in normal tissue, but negative
or weak positive in majority of various human cancers
[11]. Re-expression of hSulf-1 in cancer cells can inhibit

Survival of cancer cells depends on the activation of
a series of signaling pathways. In most of cancers, various
growth factors and their receptors are overexpressed,
such as the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [13], epidermal growth factor (EGF) [4], platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF) [5,6], hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF) [3,7] and vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) [8]. The factors activate the relative signaling
pathways, such as the Ras/Raf/mitogen-extracellular
activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/ extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphatidylinositol-3kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted
on chromosome ten (PTEN)/Akt/mammalian target of

cancer cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth [13].
Therefore, the hSulf-1 can be regarded as an inhibitory
factor in cancers and a potential target for cancer therapy.
Loss of cell cycle control and inhibition of cell
apoptosis lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumor
progression in majority of cancers. bFGF is considered to
play an important role in stimulating the proliferation of
various cancer cells. It can induce cancer cell proliferation
by activating or expressing G1-S phase proteins, including
E2F-1, cdks and cyclins, through the reactive oxygen
species/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase
B (AKT) pathway in colon cancer [14,15]. bFGF also can
sustain CD44(+)/CD24(-) cell proliferation and promote
cell progression through G0/G1 to G2/S phase transition
[16]. Inhibition of bFGF mitogenic activity with bFGFbinding peptide may reverse the effects of bFGF and lead
to suppression of proliferation, cell cycle arrest at G0/G1
phase, reduction of phospho-ERK1/2 levels in the bFGFstimulated cells of colon cancer [17], leukemia [18] and
melanoma [19].
Since hSulf-1 plays a negative regulatory role
in bFGF signaling pathways, and bFGF functions to
promote cell cycle progression in human cancers as
aforementioned, it is supposed that hSulf-1 can regulate
cancer cell cycle and control cancer programmed cell

death, such as apoptosis. However, there is no enough
evidence to clarify the relationship between hSulf-1
function and cell cycle regulation. In this study, bFGF
was used to stimulate the cell cycle progression in HCC
cell lines, hSulf-1 was re-expressed by adenoviral vector
to block the bFGF-mediated signaling pathways, and the
regulatory effects and mechanisms of hSulf-1 on HCC cell
cycle control were investigated in the in vitro experiments.
The antitumor efficacy of hSulf-1 involved in cell cycle
control was also validated in HCC cancer xenografts in
nude mice. This study gave a new insight into the function
of hSulf-1 as a negative regulator of cell cycle, which will
help to design a novel strategy of hSulf-1 gene therapy in
HCC target treatment.

of hSulf-1 was positive in the normal hepatocyte WRL68 and L02 cell lines, weak positive in the MHCC97L
and BEL-7404 cell lines, and completely negative in
the MHCC97H and SMMC-7721 cell lines (Fig. 1A,
hSulf-1). The cell cycle and cell apoptosis were measured
by PI-staining and Annexin V/PI-staining flow cytometry
(FCM), respectively, at 48 h later. Compared with the
parental cells without bFGF culture, the percentages
of G0/G1-phase were decreased and the percentages of
S-phase were increased (Fig. 1B), correspondingly, the
percentages of cell apoptosis were decreased (Fig. 1C),
in the 4 bFGF-stimulated HCC cell lines, particularly in
hSulf-1-negative MHCC97H and SMMC-7721 cell lines.
Whereas, the changes in cell cycle and apoptosis had no
significant difference in the WRL-68, L02, MHCC97L and
BEL-7404 cell lines (Table 1).
Cells cultured in media containing bFGF were
infected with adenovirus Ad5-hSulf1. The expression
of hSulf-1 was increasingly positive in the 4 HCC cell
lines and did not changed in the normal hepatocyte lines
(Fig. 1A, Ad5-hSulf1). Correspondingly, compared
with the cells cultured in media containing bFGF,

the percentages of G0/G1-phase and G2-phase were
increased, the percentages of S-phase were decreased, and
the percentages of apoptosis were increased in the Ad5hSulf1-infected HCC cells (Fig. 1B-C). This tendency
was also observed in the normal hepatocyte lines but there
were no statistically differences between cells infected
with and without adenovirus Ad5-hSulf1 (Table 1). The
negative control adenovirus Ad5-EGFP did not show any
changes on cell cycle and apoptosis.

hSulf-1 inhibits the activity of bFGF-induced
AKT and ERK signaling in HCC cells
As aforementioned, the expression of hSulf-1
can inhibit bFGF-stimulated cell cycle progression and
induces cell apoptosis in HCC cells. The activity of
downstream signaling was examined and found that bFGF
increased the phosphorylation levels of AKT and ERK in
the MHCC97H and SMMC-7721 cell lines. After infected
with Ad5-hSulf1 and the HCC cells expressed hSulf-1, the
phosphorylation levels of AKT and ERK were markedly
decreased (Fig. 2).

Figure 1: hSulf-1 reactivation reversed the bFGF-stimulated cell cycle progression and apoptosis inhibition in HCC
cells. (A) SMMC-7721 cells were cultured in 6-well plates at 1×106 cells/well with or without bFGF, and infected with adenovirus Ad5-

hSulf1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 pfu/cell. Forty-eight h later, the parental cells, cells cultured in media containing bFGF
and cells infected with adenovirus were harvested and the cell lysates were prepared. The expression of hSulf-1 was examined by Western
blot. Glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the loading control. (B, C) The harvested cells were stained by
propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V/PI, cell cycle (B) and apoptosis (C) were examined by flow cytometry. The data of all cell lines were

hSulf-1 downregulates Cyclin D1 and Survivin in
HCC cells

Expression of Cyclin D1 and Survivin was
regulated by AKT and ERK signaling in HCC
cells

Cyclin D1 and Survivin were positively expressed
in HCC cells. Under the condition of bFGF culture, the
expression of Cyclin D1 and Survivin was particularly
increased in the hSulf-1-negative MHCC97H and SMMC7721 cell lines. After infected with Ad5-hSulf1, the
expression of Cyclin D1 and Survivin was significantly
decreased (Fig. 3). The results demonstrated that the effect
of bFGF and hSulf-1 on cell cycle and apoptosis was
mediated by the target factors of Cyclin D1 and Survivin.

To confirm the superior-subordinate relationship of
hSulf-1-mediated inhibition of Cyclin D1 and Survivin,
the expression of AKT and ERK was silenced by their
specific siRNAs. After transfected with AKT-siRNA, the
expression of Cyclin D1 and Survivin was decreased in the
MHCC97H and SMMC-7721 cell lines. After transfected
with ERK-siRNA, the expression of Cyclin D1 and
Survivin was also decreased in HCC cell lines. Cyclin D1
was markedly decreased after silencing AKT expression,

and Survivin was markedly decreased after silencing
ERK expression (Fig. 4). The results demonstrated that

the expression of Cyclin D1 and Survivin was controlled
under the AKT and ERK signaling pathways.

5.55) % at rapamycin concentration of 1,000 nmol/L (Fig.
5A). The parental and preconditioned SMMC-7721 cells
were detected for the expression of AKT, ERK, Cyclin

antitumor efficacy by downregulating Cyclin D1
and Survivin in HCC xenografts in nude mice

of G0/G1-phase and the percentages of cell apoptosis
were decreased and the percentages of S-phase were
increased in the HCC cell lines, but the changes in cell
cycle and apoptosis had no significant difference in the
normal hepatocyte cell lines. By reactivation of hSulf-1
expression and function in hSulf-1-negative HCC cell
lines, the effect of bFGF on cell cycle progression and
apoptosis was reversed, demonstrating that there is a
relationship between hSulf-1 and bFGF functions.
To further investigate the molecular mechanism of
hSulf-1 effect on cancer cell cycle and apoptosis, we found
that the reactivation of hSulf-1 expression and function
in hSulf-1-negative HCC cell lines can downregulate
the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK and inhibit the
activity of bFGF-induced AKT and ERK signaling in
HCC cells, then finally led to cell cycle arrest and cell
apoptosis by suppressing the expression of Cyclin D1.
This phenomenon was approved in HCC xenograft tumor
in nude mice. Cyclin D1 is the key and initial regulator in
cell cycle control [27-29]. By binding to CDK4/6, Cyclin
D1 activates CDK4/6 and promotes the phosphorylation of
Rb protein, which makes a release of E2F-1 transcription
factor from Rb-E2F-1 complex. The released E2F-1
activates the transcription of many important cell cycle
regulatory genes to accelerate cell cycle progression
[30,31]. Silencing Cyclin D1 expression by miR-17/20
can induce G1/S cell cycle arrest and inhibit cancer cell
proliferation [32]. Cyclin D1 is considered as an oncogene
because of its overexpression with high activity in most
human cancers [33,34].
Moreover, the study also demonstrated that
inhibition of AKT and ERK signaling by hSulf-1 led to
a decrease of Survivin expression in HCC cell lines and
xenograft tumors. The overexpression of Cyclin D1 also
increases Survivin expression [35]. Because Survivin
plays an important role in maintaining cancer cell survival,
therefore, Survivin is a crucial target for cancer therapy
[36]. The activity of AKT/mTOR signaling is frequently
shown to be aberrantly up-regulated in HCC. The
allosteric AKT inhibitor, MK-2206, and γ-tocotrienol can
down-regulate AKT/mTOR signaling activity, then induce
cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, cause
apoptosis and reduce tumor growth [37,38]. There was
evidence that the inhibition of AKT signaling can reduce
Survivin expression in HCC cancer cells [39]. Survivin
belongs to the family of apoptosis inhibitors (IAPs) and
is highly expressed in majority of cancers, which makes
it an attractive target for cancer intervention and therapy
[40]. Given that the hSulf-1-mediated decrease of Cyclin
D1 and Survivin in HCC cancer cells, it is concluded that
the molecular mechanism by which the hSulf-1 expression
reverses the bFGF-mediated cell cycle progression and
cell apoptosis inhibition may be through the modification
of AKT- and ERK-regulated Cyclin D1 and Survivin
signaling pathways. Since AKT/mTOR appears to play a
central role in signaling caused by many growth factors

The xenograft tumor models were established
with both the parental SMMC-7721 cells and the bFGFcultured SMMC-7721 cells. Apparently, the bFGFcultured SMMC-7721 model had characteristics of earlier
tumor formation and quicker growth than the parental
SMMC-7721 model. After treated with Ad5-hSulf1, the
tumor inhibitory rates were 43.43 % and 53.92 % in the
parental SMMC-7721 model and the bFGF-cultured
SMMC-7721 model, respectively, demonstrating that
the tumor growth suppression of Ad5-hSulf1 was more
effective in the bFGF-cultured SMMC-7721 model (Fig.
6A). There was no difference between the Ad5-EGFPtreated group and the blank control group.
The xenograft tumors of the bFGF-cultured SMMC7721 model were examined immunohistochemically. The
expression of hSulf-1 and the percentage of apoptosis
were increased. The expression of Cyclin D1 and Survivin
was decreased in the Ad5-hSulf1-treated group, compared
with the blank control group (Fig. 6B; Table 2).

DISCUSSION
The hSulf-1 expression can diminish the cascade
phosphorylation of a series of kinases including the
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and serine/
threonine kinase (AKT), and followed by inactivation of
downstream signaling pathways. This mechanism plays a
distinct part in the inhibition of malignant transformation
and cancer growth [20-24]. Our previous study showed
that hSulf-1 is inactivated in majority of human cancers
including hepatocellular, breast, gastric, renal and colon
cancers, compared with their adjacent normal tissues,
and reactivation of hSulf-1 can suppress cancer cell
proliferation and xenograft tumor growth by inhibiting
the activity of ERK and AKT signaling pathways [11,12].
The bFGF expression can promote cancer cell
proliferation by activating the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/
ERK pathways in cancer [14,15]. bFGF binds its receptor
on cell surface and activates the downstream signaling
pathways, then functions the mitogenic activity and
promotes cancer cell cycle progression [16-19]. Since
hSulf-1 can desulfate cell surface HSPGs and block
the bFGF-mediated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling
[25,26], there is a strong reason to suppose that hSulf-1
can regulate cancer cell cycle and apoptosis. However, this
function and its molecular mechanism have been rarely
reported and not been well known yet.
The current study found that the bFGF product
promotes cell cycle progression and inhibits cell apoptosis
in hSulf-1-negative HCC cell lines and HCC xenograft
tumors, the outstanding feature was that the percentages

to regulate cell proliferation and survival, some mTOR
inhibitors, such as rapamycin and CCI-779, are tested
as anti-cancer agents [37,41,42]. We also examined
the killing effect of rapamycin with or without hSulf1
expression in SMMC-7721 cells, and the expression of
p-AKT, p-ERK, Cyclin D1 and Survivin, and further
demonstrated that hSulf-1 enhances the inhibitory effect
of rapamycin on cell survival signaling and produces
a synergic killing effect on HCC cells combined with
rapamycin.
To conclude, this study gave a convincing evidence
to demonstrate that hSulf-1 is a sulfatase and can reverse
the effect of bFGF on cell cycle and cell apoptosis by
inhibiting bFGF-mediated receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling and decreasing the expression of Cyclin D1
and Survivin. Therefore, the current study suggested that
hSulf-1 plays an important role in the regulation of cell
cycle and apoptosis and may be considered as a potential
target in HCC therapy.

The siRNAs of AKT and ERK were synthesized
(Biotechnology Co., Wuhan, China). The Akt-siRNA
targets the sequence 1338-1360 bp (21 bp target + 2
bp overhang: gactacctgcactcggagaagaa) of Akt1 gene
(NM_005163.2). The ERK-siRNA targets the sequence
903-925 bp (acctgaattgtatcatcaacat) of ERK1 gene
(NM_002746.2). A mock control siRNA (Ctrl-siRNA,
gacttcataaggcgcatgctgtc) was synchronously synthesized.
Totally 106 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and
transfected with siRNAs at a concentration of 10 μg/well
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Casbad, CA).
Cells were harvested at 48 h later after transfection and
examined for the indicated factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell preparation
The HCC cell lines, MHCC97H, MHCC97L,
SMMC-7721, BEL-7404, and the normal hepatocyte lines,
WRL-68 and L02, were purchased from the Shanghai Cell
Bank (Shanghai Institute for Biological Science, Chinese
Academy of Science, Shanghai, China). All cell lines were
cultured in media according to the provider’s instruction.
The preconditioned cells used in the in vitro experiments
were cultured in media containing 20 ng/ml bFGF (SigmaAldrich, Shanghai, China), or in media containing 0 to
1,000 nmol/L rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai,
China). Cells were also preconditioned by infection of
adenovirus (Ad5-hSulf1, Ad5-EGFP) [13] at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 100 pfu/cell. All the parental and
preconditioned cells were cultured for 48 h, and harvested.

Cell viability experiment
The parental and preconditioned cells were cultured
in 96-well plates at 1×104 cells/well for 48 h, and
measured by Cell Proliferation Kit I (Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Germany) to determine the cell viability according
to the kit protocol.

Animal models and in vivo experiments
The animal study was approved by the animal
ethics committee of Second Military Medical University
(Shanghai, China). All animal study procedures were
performed in compliance with the Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals of the US Department of
Health and Human Services.
The xenograft tumor models were established by
subcutaneously injecting the parental SMMC-7721 cells
and the bFGF-cultured SMMC-7721 cells (106 cells per
mouse), respectively, into the right flanks of 30 BALB/c
(nu/nu) mice (Shanghai Experimental Animal Center,
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China). The
xenograft tumors were about 0.5 cm in diameters after
two weeks later in the bFGF-cultured SMMC-7721 model
and after three weeks later in the parental SMMC-7721
model. Mice in every model were separated randomly

Analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis by flow
cytometry (FCM)
Cells were cultured in 6-well plates at 1×106 cells/
well and harvested. The procedures of propidium iodide
(PI) staining, Annexin V/PI staining, and the examinations
of cell cycle and apoptosis by flow cytometer (FACS420,
BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were operated as described
previously [43].

Examination of gene expression by Western blot
The expression of indicated factors was examined by
Western blot, with the primary antibodies including rabbit

into 3 groups: the Ad5-hSulf1-treated group, Ad5-EGFPtreated group and control groups, 5 mice per group. The
Ad5-hSulf1 and Ad5-EGFP groups were intratumorally
injected with 2×108 pfu viruses, one injection every other
day and totally 5 injections with total dose of 109 pfu
viruses per mouse. Mice in the control group were injected
with the same volume of viral preservation solution (10
mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 4 % sucrose, 2 mmol/L MgCl2).
Tumor volume was measured according to the previously
reported method and formula [13,39]. The observation
was stopped 35 days later after treatments, when the tumor
volume in any group was over the standard (2000 mm3)
approved by the animal ethics committee.
All mice were painlessly killed, and the tumors were
collected from the bFGF-cultured SMMC-7721 model.
The expression of hSulf-1, Cyclin D1 and Survivin was
examined by immunohistochemistry, and cell apoptosis
was detected by the TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) according to reference [44]. The percentages of
positive cells were counted in each section under 5 highpower fields (objective lens: 40×).

Statistical analysis
The experimental data from 3 times of independent
in vitro experiments, as well as in vivo experimental
data from 5 mice per group, were presented as ‘mean
± standard deviation (SD)’, and analyzed by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). When the data were
statistically different among the multiple groups, the
SNK-q test was used to conduct the multiple comparison.
The statistical analysis software package PASW Statistics
18 was used. P values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
