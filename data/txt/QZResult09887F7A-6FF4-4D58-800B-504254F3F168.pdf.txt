Abstract
Bromo and extra terminal (BET) proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT) are transcriptional regulators
required for efﬁcient expression of several growth promoting and antiapoptotic genes as well as for cell-cycle
progression. BET proteins are recruited on transcriptionally active chromatin via their two N-terminal bromodomains (BRD), a protein interaction module that speciﬁcally recognizes acetylated lysine residues in histones
H3 and H4. Inhibition of the BET–histone interaction results in transcriptional downregulation of a number of
oncogenes, providing a novel pharmacologic strategy for the treatment of cancer. Here, we present a potent and
highly selective dihydroquinazoline-2-one inhibitor, PFI-1, which efﬁciently blocks the interaction of BET BRDs
with acetylated histone tails. Cocrystal structures showed that PFI-1 acts as an acetyl-lysine (Kac) mimetic inhibitor
efﬁciently occupying the Kac binding site in BRD4 and BRD2. PFI-1 has antiproliferative effects on leukemic cell
lines and efﬁciently abrogates their clonogenic growth. Exposure of sensitive cell lines with PFI-1 results in G1 cellcycle arrest, downregulation of MYC expression, as well as induction of apoptosis and induces differentiation of
primary leukemic blasts. Intriguingly, cells exposed to PFI-1 showed signiﬁcant downregulation of Aurora B
kinase, thus attenuating phosphorylation of the Aurora substrate H3S10, providing an alternative strategy for
the speciﬁc inhibition of this well-established oncology target. Cancer Res; 73(11); 3336–46. 2013 AACR.

that regulate gene transcription and chromatin organization
and play a key function recruiting these protein complexes to
acetylated chromatin. Dysfunction of BRD-containing proteins
has been linked to the development of diverse diseases in
particular to the development of cancer (3).
Bromodomains are highly sequence diverse but they share a
conserved fold that comprises a left-handed bundle of 4 alpha
helices (aZ, aA, aB, aC; ref. 4). The acetyl-lysine side chain is
typically anchored by a hydrogen bond to a conserved asparagine residue and water-mediated interactions with a conserved tyrosine (2, 5). Crystal structures of bromo and extra
terminal (BET) complexes with di-acetylated histone 4 tail
peptides showed that the ﬁrst BRDs of BRD4 and BRDT may
accommodate 2 acetyl-lysines in a single binding site (2, 6).
The BET family of BRD proteins comprises 4 members in
mammals (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT) each containing 2
conserved N-terminal BRDs. BET proteins play critical roles in
cellular proliferation and cell-cycle progression (7). Genetic
rearrangement of the BRD4 and BRD3 locus in which in-frame
chimeric proteins of the N-terminal BRDs of BRD4 or BRD3
with the protein NUT (nuclear protein in testis) give rise to the
development of NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), an incurable
uniformly fatal subtype of squamous carcinoma (8). BRD4 has
been shown to be critical for survival of a number of diverse
tumors due to its function promoting transcription of growth
promoting and antiapoptotic genes (9) which prompted the
development of potent and selective protein interaction inhibitors targeting BET BRDs. The potent pan-BET inhibitors
(þ)-JQ1 and GSK1210151A (I-BET151) have shown signiﬁcant
antitumor activity in murine models of NMC (10), multiple

myeloma (11), acute myeloid leukemia (AML; ref. 12), and
mixed lineage leukemia (MLL; ref. 13). Genetic knockdown by
RNAi or exposure of cells with BET inhibitors resulted in a
signiﬁcant transcriptional downregulation of MYC (11).
In contrast to most transcriptional regulators that dissociate
from chromatin during mitosis, BRD4 preferentially associates
with mitotic chromosomes (14) "bookmarking" G1 and growthassociated genes for efﬁcient postmitotic transcription, providing a mechanism for transcriptional memory during cell
division (15). BRD4 knockdown in primary human keratinocytes by RNAi results in severe cytokinesis defects and downregulation of Aurora B expression. Aurora kinases (A, B, and C)
are essential for mitotic entry and progression (16). The A and B
isoforms play distinct roles during mitosis: Aurora A is required
for mitotic spindle assembly during pro and metaphase, whereas Aurora B is part of the mitotic passenger complex mediating
chromosome segregation by ensuring proper biorientation of
sister chromatids during meta and anaphase (17, 18). Both
Aurora isoforms are highly expressed in cancer, augment Rasinduced transformation, and have therefore emerged as attractive therapeutic targets (19, 20). Interestingly, transcription of
Aurora A and B is strongly upregulated by the BRD4 target
gene Myc, whereas, in turn, Aurora kinases also have a critical
function in regulating c-Myc turnover by regulating protein
stability, suggesting that activity of these growth promoting
proteins is tightly regulated by a feedback loop (21).
Here, we describe a novel highly potent inhibitor PFI-1 that
selectively targets BET BRDs. PFI-1 binds to BET BRDs with
low nanomole potency and is chemically distinct from previously reported BET inhibitors. Exposure of leukemia cells to
PFI-1 results in induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis,
differentiation, and in downregulation of the Aurora B kinase.
This highly selective chemical probe provides a versatile tool
for further validation of BRD4 in cancer and other diseases and
suggests synergism between 2 major oncogenes, c-Myc and
Aurora B that can be simultaneously targeted by selective BET
inhibition.

Materials and Methods

In a screen for putative acetyl-lysine mimetic compounds,
we identiﬁed the simple fragment 6-bromo-3-methyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-one as a BRD4 and CREBBP BRD inhibitor.
This inhibitor displaced tetra-acetylated histone 4 peptides in
ALPHA (ampliﬁed luminescent proximity homogeneous
assay) screen assays with an IC50 value of approximately 50
mmol/L for the ﬁrst domain of BRD4 [BRD4(1)]. Expansion of
this scaffold resulted in a series of highly potent and speciﬁc
benzenesulfonamide-quinazolin-2-one BET inhibitors. PFI-1
was selected as one of the most potent and selective compounds of about 300 inhibitors proﬁled in ALPHA screen
assays (Fig. 1A). The inhibitor was synthesized as outlined in
Supplementary Fig. S1. Structure–activity relationship of this
class of compounds will be described elsewhere (23).

BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, BRDT, and CREBBP BRDs were cloned,
expressed, and puriﬁed as previously described (10). For biotin
labeling, CREBBP (R1081-G1198) and BRD2 (K71-N195) were
subcloned into pNIC-BIO1 (Gene Bank: EF198106) and
expressed in BL21 (DE3)-R3-BirA. D-Biotine was dissolved
into 10 mmol/L bicine pH 8.3 and added to the culture at
500 mmol/L ﬁnal. Biotinylated protein was immobilized on
Super Streptavidin Biosensors using 50 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.4,
100 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.01% Tween.
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), temperature shift
assays, and ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching were
carried out as previously described (22). All cell lines were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma) containing
10% FBS. In vitro cytotoxicity assays were conducted in triplicate using either Cell-Titer-Glo reagent (Promega) or WST-1
(Roche) according to instructions provided by the vendor.

peripheral blood of healthy patients, were plated in methyl-

NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rg null (NOG) mice were engrafted with
B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) primary blasts
t(1, 19)þ using a sample obtained from a 9-year-old child
with high-risk B-ALL. The engraftment process was monitored
by staining peripheral blood samples for human CD45 and
mouse CD45. At 5 weeks, hCD45 was at least 1% and a treatment cycle was initiated by injection of 50 mg/kg JQ1 4 times
per week into the peritoneum (IP) for 3 weeks. Bone marrow
was extracted from the femur of JQ1 and vehicle [dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)]–treated mice, ﬁxed in 10% formalin, and
mounted in parafﬁn blocks.
Fixation, immunostaining, and confocal microscopy
Approximately 5  104 cells were used for each cytospot.
Cells were centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 minutes using a
Cytospin 3 SHANDON cytocentrifuge. Fixation of the cells was
carried out with 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS. Incubation was conducted for 16 hours at 4 C in 0.3% Triton X-100,
0.5% BSA, and the indicated primary antibody. After washing,
the cells were incubated with the secondary antibody for 2
hours. The cells were washed and a coverslip was placed on top
by adding a droplet of mounting solution (Clear-Mount, Invitrogen). Confocal ﬂuorescence images were obtained by a
LSM710 microscope (Zeiss).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were conducted using the EZ-ChIP Kit by Millpore according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Results were quantiﬁed both by
semiquantitative and quantitative PCR, conducted using Terra
qPCR Direct SYBR Premix (Clonetech) on an ABI 7900HT.

for BRD4(1) and 98 nmol/L for BRD2(2). The tight interaction
of PFI-1 with BET acetyl-lysine–binding sites was conﬁrmed by
ITC, which revealed dissociation constants (KD) of PFI-1 of 47.4
 2.5 nmol/L [BRD4(1)] and 194.9  6 nmol/L [BRD4(2)] for the
2 BRDs present in BRD4. ITC titrations against BRDs of the BET
family showed that PFI-1 bound with similar afﬁnities (Fig. 1B
and Supplementary Table S1). Binding of PFI-1 was strongly
driven by large negative binding enthalpy change, suggesting
that polar interactions of PFI-1 with BET BRDs are highly
favorable. Interestingly, binding enthalpies (DH) were between
4 and 7 kcal/mol larger for N-terminal BET BRDs. However,
this large difference in favorable binding enthalpy was almost
completely compensated by unfavorable changes in binding
entropy (DS) resulting in similar binding constants. The largest
difference in binding afﬁnity (about 4 fold) was observed for the
2 BRDs of BRD4.
Comprehensive screening of PFI-1 against 42 human BRDs
using temperature shift assays (10, 24) have shown high
speciﬁcity of PFI-1 for the BET family of BRDs (Fig. 1C and
Supplementary Table S2). The largest DTm shift observed
outside the BET family was 2.6 C for BRDs present in the

histone acetyl transferases CBP/EP300. The interaction with
CBP was too weak for determination of an accurate IC50 value
using ALPHA screen assays. However, we estimated an afﬁnity
of PFI-1 for CBP of approximately 11 mmol/L using Bio-Layer
Interferometry (BLI; Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 25), suggesting
more than 300-fold selectivity over the 2 BRDs that showed the
largest DTm shift outside the BET BRD family. In comparison,
BLI determined an afﬁnity of 111 nmol/L for BRD2(1) in
agreement with ITC and ALPHA screen data. We also assessed
activity of PFI-1 outside the BRD family. Screening against 38
protein kinases revealed no signiﬁcant inhibitory activity of
PFI-1. Similarly, no signiﬁcant activity was observed screening
PFI-1 against 40 human kinases and 14 human membrane
receptors (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).

inhibitor with the BRD acetyl-lysine–binding site. Details on
data collection and reﬁnement are summarized in Supplementary Table S5. The overall structure of the PFI-1 in complex
with BRD4(1) revealed the typical helical fold and structural
elements of BRDs (Fig. 2A) and comparison with the apostructure (PDB-ID:2OSS) showed only minor structural
rearrangements in the ZA-loop regions. The inhibitor and
coordinating residues and water molecules were well deﬁned
by electron density (Fig. 2B). PFI-1 showed an extraordinary
shape complementarity with the Kac binding site. The quinazolinone carbonyl and nitrogen acted as a hydrogen bond
donor/acceptor pair that interacted with the conserved asparagine N140. The quinazolinone carbonyl also formed a second
water-mediated hydrogen bond with the conserved residue
Y97. The network of 5 tightly bound water molecules that are
typically found at the base of BRD acetyl-lysine–binding pocket
was also conserved in the BRD4(1) PFI-1 complex. Comparison
to BRD4(1) structures of diacetylated peptide complexes (2)
conﬁrmed the acetyl-lysine mimetic binding mode of PFI-1
(Fig. 2C). The carbonyl moieties of the quinazolinone and the

acetyl-lysine are in similar position and mediate the same
interactions in superimposition of both BRD4(1) ligand complexes. Superimposition with the BRD4(1)/(þ)-JQ1 complex
revealed a largely diverse binding mode. However, both complexes form an acetyl-lysine mimetic hydrogen bond to N140 as
well as aromatic stacking and hydrophobic interactions with
W81 and the shelf region of the acetyl-lysine–binding site.
ITC data showed a signiﬁcantly smaller binding enthalpy
change to second BRDs of BET family members and we were
interested if the cocrystal structure of PFI-1 with a second BRD
would explain these striking differences in the observed binding thermodynamics. Comparison of the structure of the PFI-1
complex of BRD4(1) and BRD2(2) showed that polar interaction of the inhibitor with BRD2(2) are less optimal (Fig. 2D and
E). The hydrogen bond between the quinazolinone NH with the
conserved asparagine residue [N140 in BRD4(1) and N429 in
BRD2(2)] is less favorable (distance of 3.3 Å) in the case of BRD2
(2) when compared with BRD4(1; distance of 2.9 Å). In addition,
the water-mediated hydrogen bond between the sulfonamide
NH function and the ZA loop backbone carbonyl observed in

the BRD4(1) complex (3.2 Å) is further away from the bridging
water molecule which was, however, still observed in the BRD2
(2) cocrystal structure (3.8 Å). Interestingly, in contrast to
(þ)-JQ1 BRD complexes, H433 reoriented and ﬂipped into the
acetyl-lysine–binding site to interact with the methoxybenzyl
moiety of PFI-1. This large structural rearrangement may
provide an explanation for the large difference in DS upon
binding of PFI-1 to the ﬁrst and second BRDs. H433 is conserved in all second BRDs, whereas in N-terminal BET BRDs,
this residue is always an aspartate [D144 in BRD4(1)]. This
difference in Kac site composition may be explored for the
development of inhibitors that preferentially recognize either
the ﬁrst or second BRD.
PFI-1 displaces BRD4 from chromatin
To establish whether PFI-1 dissociates full-length BRD4
from acetylated chromatin in cells, we developed ﬂuorescence
recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP) experiments in human
osteosarcoma cells (U2OS) transfected with GFP–BRD4. The
use of FRAP in assessing the diffusion of BRD-containing
proteins tagged with ﬂuorescent fusion partners and therefore
providing evidence of the level of chromatin association has
been previously established (22), and we have successfully used
this method to show the on-target effect of the BET inhibitor
JQ1 in BRD4-dependent NMC cell lines (10). Cells treated with 1
and 5 mmol/L PFI-1 showed signiﬁcantly faster ﬂuorescent

recovery times when compared with cells that have not been
exposed to this inhibitor, suggesting that full-length BRD4 was
displaced from chromatin in PFI-1–treated cells (Fig. 3). Differences in ﬂuorescent recovery time of PFI-1–treated cells
were comparable with effects observed for the biochemically
active (þ)-JQ1 stereoisomer.
PFI-1 inhibits proliferation of a subset of leukemic cells
We used a luminescent ATP-based cytotoxicity assay to
examine the sensitivity of a panel of established leukemia cell
lines to PFI-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Table 1). In
agreement with earlier studies, we found that cell lines carrying
oncogenic rearrangements in the MLL locus (26) such as
MV4;11 (MLL-AF4), NOMO-1 (MLL-AF9), SEMKH2 (MLL-AF4)
RS4;11 (MLL-AF4), or THP-1 (MLL-AF9) were highly sensitive
to BET inhibition (12, 13, 27). Comparable activity was also
observed for the AML1–ETO fusion oncogenes bearing AML
cell line Kasumi. Signiﬁcantly less sensitive (5–10 mmol/L) was
the ALL-derived cell line KOCL-45 despite its MLL–AF4
rearrangement and the human histiocytic lymphoma cell
line U937. No signiﬁcant activity was detected for K-562
[BCR-ABL–positive blast crisis chronic myelogenous leukemia
(CML)] and PL-21 (AML) showing that the growth inhibition
observed in certain leukemia cell lines is not due to a
general cytotoxicity of PFI-1. However, the activity of PFI-1
on cell proliferation of leukemia cell lines was between 5- and

10-fold weaker than that observed for the pan-BET inhibitor
(þ)-JQ1.
We also investigated the efﬁciency of PFI-1 to suppress the
clonogenic growth of leukemic cells in methylcellulose. In
agreement with the cytotoxicity assays in liquid culture, we
observed strong ablation of clonogenic growth in the PFI-1–
sensitive cell lines MV4;11 and THP-1 (Fig. 4). However,
clonogenic growth of human CD34-positive human hematopoietic stem cells from 2 different healthy donors was also
signiﬁcantly impaired. Interestingly, colony formation of the
PFI-1 insensitive cell line K562 was not affected, but exposure
to PFI-1 did signiﬁcantly reduce cell numbers, suggesting that
growth is still compromised in this cell line. This effect was also
observed using (þ)-JQ1 (Fig. 4C–E). The sensitivity of cell lines
to BET-dependent growth inhibition was independent of BRD4
mRNA expression levels. We conducted quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments quantifying the levels of the 2
main BRD4 isoforms [long (GI:19718731) and short
(GI:7657218)]. We found comparable levels of the short BRD4
isoforms in all cell lines. mRNA expression levels of the long
isoform were particularly high in K-562 and THP-1 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3).
PFI-1 induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in sensitive
cell lines
Annexin V staining combined with FACS analysis established strong induction of apoptosis by BRD4 knockdown or
chemical inhibition of BET proteins (12, 13, 27). Here, we were
interested to characterize the mechanism of PFI-1–induced
apoptosis using Western blot analysis of proteins known to
play key roles in apoptosis. In the BET inhibitor–sensitive cell
line MV4;11, we observed strong induction of PARP1 and
procaspase 7 cleavage after 24-hour exposure with PFI-1,
whereas protein levels as well as the phosphorylation state of
the proapoptotic protein BAD were unaffected. In contrast,
neither PARP1 nor procaspase 7 cleavage was observed in the

www.aacrjournals.org

PFI-1 insensitive cell line K-562 (Fig. 5). In agreement with
earlier studies using (þ)-JQ1, we also detected signiﬁcantly
lower c-Myc protein levels in PFI-1–treated MV4;11 cells, but
only a minor reduction in c-Myc levels was observed in K-562
cells (12, 27). This analysis shows that the canonical caspaseinduced apoptotic pathway is activated in cell lines that are
sensitive to BET BRD inhibition by low molecular weight
inhibitors. As predicted from RNAi knock down studies and
studies on (þ)-JQ1 (10) that have shown a key role of BRD4 in
cell-cycle progression, we found that exposure of cells sensitive
to PFI-1 cause cell-cycle arrest. In contrast, the cell cycle in PFI1–insensitive cell lines (K-562) was not affected as shown by
ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S4). Because c-Myc drives
expression of a number of genes that are essential for cell-cycle
progression (e.g., E2Fs, CDC25A, CDK2, CDK4, and Rb), the
observed G1–S arrest might be a consequence of c-Myc depletion in sensitive MV4;11 but not K-562 cells (28–31).

BRD4 is one of the few transcriptional regulators that are
recruited to chromatin during mitosis providing a mechanism
for transcriptional memory during cell division (14, 15, 22).
Mitotic entry and progression are principally regulated by
serine/threonine kinases of the Aurora family (16). Aurora
kinases are highly expressed in diverse cancer types and are
also frequently upregulated in leukemia (32, 33). In addition,
Aurora B expression levels are modulated by BRD4 and
are stimulated by c-Myc, whereas c-Myc stability is regulated
by Aurora kinase–dependent degradation (21). We were
therefore interested to study whether inhibition of BET BRDs
by the inhibitors PFI-1 and (þ)-JQ1 would affect Aurora B
protein levels resulting in indirect inhibition of the Aurora B
oncogene.
We found high expression levels in Western blots using
Aurora B-speciﬁc antibodies in both MV4;11 and K-562 cells

(Fig. 6A). Aurora B often appeared as a double band possibly
due to different phosphorylation states of the protein. Exposure of these cells to PFI-1 and (þ)-JQ1 resulted in signiﬁcant
reduction of Aurora B protein levels after 8-hour exposure in
the BET inhibitor–sensitive cell line MV4;11. In K-562 cells, a
reduction of Aurora B has been observed after 4 hours but the
protein levels were increased again after 8 hours. This is likely
due to differences of BET inhibitors on Aurora B mRNA
expression and Aurora B degradation in these 2 cell lines. As
a consequence of Aurora B downregulation, we observed
signiﬁcantly reduced phosphorylation of the Aurora substrate
histone 3 S10 (H3S10) in cells stained with H3S10p-speciﬁc
antibodies (Fig. 6B); H3S10 phosphorylation was completely
ablated in Western blots (Fig. 6C) in MV4;11 cells. Immunocytochemistry and Western blots showed that reduction of
H3S10 phosphorylation levels were signiﬁcantly less dramatic
in K-562 cells than observed in MV4;11 cells. In conclusion,
BRD4 inhibition results in signiﬁcant Aurora B inactivation

offering an alternative strategy for inhibition of this attractive
kinase target.
Synthetic lethality of BET and Aurora kinase inhibition
As efﬁcacious killing of tumor cells by Aurora inhibitors is
often constrained by dose-limiting toxicity, we were interested
if dual inhibition of BET proteins and Aurora kinases would be
synergistic. We selected for these studies the potent and
reversible small-molecule Aurora inhibitor VX-680 (MK0457) that inhibits all 3 Aurora kinase isoforms with low
nanomole potency (0.6, 18, and 4.6 nmol/L for Aurora A, Aurora
B, and Aurora C, respectively). This inhibitor has shown in vivo
efﬁcacy in xenograft models in human AML and other cancers
and has entered clinical testing (34–37). Aurora kinases interact with many key regulators of the cell cycle and cell survival,
including p53, cyclin B, and Cdc2. As a consequence, inhibition
of Aurora kinases affects different stages of the cell cycle:
Aurora A inhibition has been associated with G2–M phase

level of hCD45 was at least 1% and mice were treated for 3
weeks with 50 mg/kg (þ)-JQ1 as described (10). Bone marrow
was extracted from the femur of tumor-bearing mice and
stained with speciﬁc antibodies for Aurora B and c-Myc. The
immunoﬂuorescent images revealed strong downregulation of
both Aurora B as well as c-Myc (Fig. 7B) showing that BET

arrest, whereas Aurora B inhibition leads to failure in cell
division, abnormal exit from mitosis, polyploidy cells, and
ultimately induction of apoptosis. We observed at low inhibitor
concentration (lower than 20 nmol/L) cell-cycle arrest in G2–M
phase consisted with Aurora A inhibition. A higher concentration, VX680, caused predominantly G0–G1 arrest. Apoptosis
was observed at concentrations higher than 160 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly, combination PFI-1 or
(þ)-JQ1 and VX-680 at concentration that do not cause
observable toxicity as single agents led to strong cancer cell
toxicity (Fig. 7A). Intriguingly, the optimal concentration of
VX-680 was 40 nmol/L for both BET inhibitors tested. At this
concentration, the G2–M arrest observed at lower VX-680 is
released leading to sensitization of the tested cell lines to dual
Aurora and BET inhibition. At higher VX-680 concentration,
however, this synergistic effect is lost. It is therefore likely that
the strong induction of apoptosis at 40 nmol/L VX-680 with
both BET inhibitors is highly dependent on differences in BETdependent gene expression and cell-cycle effects induced by
Aurora kinase inhibitors. No synergy between VX-680 and BET
inhibitors was observed in K-562 cells that are insensitive to
BET inhibition (data not shown).
BET inhibition causes downregulation of Aurora B
in vivo
To study downregulation of Aurora B in vivo, we established
a xenograft model of high-risk primary childhood B-cell ALL.
Pharmacokinetics studies in mice suggested that the necessary
effective dose of PFI-1 cannot be obtained in vivo (23) which
prevented us from using PFI-1 for long-term in vivo studies in
mice and (þ)-JQ1 was therefore used. Engraftment was monitored by staining peripheral blood samples for human and
mouse CD45. After 5 weeks of engraftment in NOG mice, the

inhibition signiﬁcantly reduces Aurora B levels in this in vivo
model.
PFI-1 and JQ1 dissociate BRD4 from HOXA9 and
promotes differentiation
Evolutionarily conserved HOX genes are transcription factors that play an important role during hematopoiesis in
regulating apoptosis, receptor signaling, differentiation, motility, and angiogenesis. Aberrant expression of HOX genes has
been implicated in the development of leukemia and other
cancers (38–40). During hematopoietic cell development,
clusters of HOX genes are highly expressed in primitive
hematopoietic cells and in poorly differentiated leukemic cells,
whereas they are largely downregulated in differentiated cells.
In particular, HOXA9 has been identiﬁed as a marker of poor
prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (41), and

3344

Cancer Res; 73(11) June 1, 2013

overexpression of HOXA9 leads to immortalization of bone
marrow cells and development of leukemia in mice (42). We
were therefore interested to know whether BRD4 inhibition
directly inﬂuences HOXA9 expression and induces differentiation of primary leukemic blasts. ChIP assays showed that both
(þ)-JQ1 as well as PFI-1 displace BRD4 from the HOXA9
promoter region (Fig. 7C, Supplementary Fig. S6). Quantitative
PCR showed that HOXA9 mRNA is upregulated after 4 hours
but strongly downregulated after incubation times of 8 and 24
hours in PFI-1–treated MV4;11 cells but not in BET inhibitor–
insensitive K-562 cells that follow, however, the same biphasic
pattern of the detected mRNA levels (Fig. 7D). The delayed
response of HOXA9 transcriptional downregulation suggests
an indirect mechanism that is possibly regulated by reduced
c-Myc levels. As PFI-1 inhibits all BET family members, differences in BET protein levels or levels of the target genes may

result in the different overall response of HOXA9 expression in
these 2 cell lines. In agreement with the known key function of
HOXA9 in suppressing differentiation, murine MLL-AF9 leukemic blasts treated with PFI-1 showed rapid differentiation
into cells with polymorphonuclear neutrophil–like appearances (Fig. 7E).

Discussion
This study presents a chemically diverse BET inhibitor PFI-1
with high potency and selectivity for this subfamily of BRDcontaining proteins. Here, we used PFI-1 to study the role of BET
proteins in acute leukemia and in regulating HOXA9 expression
as well as Aurora B kinase activity. Inhibition of BET BRDs
results in the change of transcription of diverse target genes,
many of them linked to cellular proliferation and prevention of
apoptosis. The set of BET-regulated target genes is highly
correlated in sensitive cell lines. For instance, in the study by
Dawson and colleagues (13), the top 100 genes that were found to
be decreased in the sensitive MLL cell lines MOLM-13 and
MV4;11 overlapped and contained many known MLL target
genes such as key regulators of proliferation (MYC, CDK6) and
antiapoptotic genes (BCL2), suggesting that BET proteins are
required for efﬁcient expression of genes driven by oncogenic
MLL-fusion proteins. Expression of these genes was less affected
in inhibitor insensitive K-562 cells expressing the BCR-ABL
fusion gene product. A recent study by Mertz and colleagues
has shown that MYC expression was affected by BET inhibition
only in the context of natural, chromosomally translocated or
ampliﬁed gene loci, but not if expression is driven by nonendogenous promoters or viral insertions providing a possibility
for stratiﬁcation for BET-sensitive cancer types (27).
In this study, we have also shown that BET inhibition results
in signiﬁcant downregulation of Aurora B kinase in vitro as well
as in vivo. However, whether Aurora B expression is directly
mediated by BET or indirectly through downregulation of MYC
expression remains to be shown. A recent report showed that
knockdown of the BET family member BRD4 results in downregulation of Aurora B expression, whereas exogenous overexpression of BRD4 increases Aurora B protein levels (43). In
synchronized cells, Aurora B protein levels have been significantly reduced during mitosis after RNAi knockdown of BRD4
(43) and abnormal chromosomal segregation has been
observed in BRD4-depleted primary human foreskin keratinocytes leading to high frequency of binuclear tetraploid and
octoploid nuclei (43). Aurora B activity is also tightly linked
to c-Myc function. Yang and colleagues have recently shown
that the pan-Aurora inhibitor VX-680 preferentially kills cells
that overexpress c-Myc (44) and that both oncogenes are
frequently ampliﬁed in colorectal carcinomas and medulloblastomas (45, 46). Here, we showed that VX-680 inhibition
is strongly synergistic with BET inhibition showing effective

induction of apoptosis at concentration that did not show
any cytotoxic effects of the single agents. Interestingly,
synergism of VX-680 has also been observed with the HDAC
inhibitor vorinostat as a result of reactivated proapoptotic
genes and enhanced cancer cell death. It is likely that
suppression of antiapoptotic and reactivation of preapoptotic genes that have been reported for BET inhibitors (13)
leads to the strong induction of apoptosis that have been
observed in our synergy study.
The 8 BRDs present in the 4 human BET family members
share high sequence similarity in their acetyl-lysine–binding
sites making the design of target selective inhibitors a challenging task. Although we believe that it will be difﬁcult to
achieve high selectivity for any of the isoforms, we observed
that all ﬁrst and second BRDs contain a set of diverse residues.
These differences could be explored for the development of
subdomain-speciﬁc inhibitors, which is an ongoing research
activity in our laboratory.
