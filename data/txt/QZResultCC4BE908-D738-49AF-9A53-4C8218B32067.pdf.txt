ABSTRACT
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) may represent targets for carcinogenic initiation by
chemical and environmental agents. Recent studies have raised a concern over the
potential carcinogenicity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), one of the most commonly used
engineered nanomaterials with asbestos-like properties. Here, we show that chronic
(6-month) exposure of human lung epithelial cells to single-walled (SW) CNTs at the
workplace-relevant concentration induced an emergence of lung CSCs, as indicated
by the induction of CSC tumor spheres and side population (SP). These CSCs, which
were found to overexpress tumor promoter caveolin-1 (Cav-1), displayed aggressive
cancer phenotypes of apoptosis resistance and enhanced cell invasion and migration
compared with their non-CSC counterpart. Using gene manipulation strategies, we
reveal for the first time that Cav-1 plays an essential role in CSC regulation and
aggressiveness of SWCNT-transformed cells partly through p53 dysregulation,
consistent with their suggested role by microarray and gene ontology analysis. Cav1 not only promoted tumorigenesis in a xenograft mouse model but also metastasis
of the transformed cells to neighboring tissues. Since CSCs are crucial to the initiation
and early development of carcinogenesis, our findings on CSC induction by SWCNTs
and Cav-1 could aid in the early detection and risk assessment of the disease.

INTRODUCTION

extensively studied [7−9], relatively little has been carried
out or known about the cancer risk caused by nanomaterial
exposure, notably carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which share
similar properties with asbestos fibers, a known human
carcinogen [10−13]. Identifying CSC induction and its
regulation by CNTs might lead to a better understanding
of CNT carcinogenesis.
Typical developmental period for fiber-induced lung
cancer in humans is 30-40 years [14]. The present study
was undertaken to investigate whether chronic exposure of
human lung epithelial cells to CNTs can induce CSCs, and
if so by what mechanisms. Recently, a number of proteins
have been identified to have a high prognostic correlation
with lung cancer. Among these, a plasma membraneassociated protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1) has gained a

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
death, and environmental and occupational exposure
is a major cause of most cases [1,2]. Evolving research
in stem cells and cancer biology have provided strong
evidence for the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in
various human solid tumors, including brain, breast, bone
marrow, prostrate, colon, and lung [3,4]. These CSCs are
potential driving force of tumor initiation and progression
due to their self-renewal and tumorigenic properties
[5,6]. Induction of CSCs from non-tumorigenic cells may
initiate carcinogenesis. While carcinogenesis induced by
various chemicals and environmental agents including
cigarette smoke, air pollution, and heavy metals has been

considerable attention, since its expression has been
linked to the advanced stages of squamous and non-small
cell lung cancers [15−17]. Poor prognosis and reduced
disease-free and overall survival were observed in Cav1-positive patients [16]. Experimentally, an up-regulation
of Cav-1 was shown to potentiate various steps in tumor
progression, metastasis and chemoresistance [18,19],
anchorage-independent growth (anoikis resistance)
[20,21], and cell migration and invasion [22,23].
Here, we demonstrate that single-walled (SW)
CNTs can trigger lung epithelial cells to initiate CSCs,
which exhibit aggressive cancer behaviors of apoptosis
resistance and enhanced cell motility. These CNT-derived
CSCs overexpressed Cav-1 which was investigated in this

study for its role in CSC regulation and tumorigenesis
using gene manipulation and murine xenograft strategies.
Our results indicate a novel role of Cav-1-p53 axis
in CSC regulation, which could be important in lung
tumorigenesis and metastasis.

RESULTS
Chronic SWCNT exposure induces CSCs
We have previously shown that chronic exposure of
human lung epithelial cells to non-cytotoxic concentration
of SWCNTs induced malignant transformation as
assessed by soft-agar colony formation, a common
measure of anchorage-independent growth, and mouse
xenograft tumorigenesis assays [12]. However, the
fundamental understanding and regulatory mechanisms
of tumorigenesis are not well understood. In this study,
we first showed that SWCNT-induced malignant

then cultured in SWCNT-free medium for more than 20 passages,
and designated as BSW cells. After which they were analyzed
for soft agar colony formation (A) and tumor sphere formation
(B). Passage-matched control BC cells were grown in the same
background level of dispersant. (C) Analysis of side population

transformation was irreversible, since cells that were
propagated for more than 20 passages in the absence of
SWCNTs still maintained the ability to grow on soft agar
(Figure 1A). We next tested whether chronic SWCNT
exposure can induce CSCs, a subpopulation that may drive
tumor initiation and progression. Fundamental properties
of CSCs are their ability to self-renew and generate
differentiated progeny [24,25]. Tumor sphere assay under
non-attached and serum-starved conditions was used to

determine the CSC self-renewal capability. Figure 1B
shows that while passage-control BC cells minimally
survived, chronic SWCNT-exposed BSW cells formed
large floating spherical colonies. These results suggest
the existence of cells that possess the characteristics of
CSCs and their acquisition from non-tumorigenic lung
epithelial cells by SWCNTs. The BSW cells that were
passaged from first-generation tumor spheres preserved
the ability to form second-generation spheres (not shown),
thus confirming their renewal and repopulation capability.
The ability to efflux Hoechst dye via the multidrug
resistance transporter ATP-binding cassette sub-family
G member 2 (ABCG2) as identified by side population
(SP) has proven to be a valuable marker for CSCs from
various solid tumors and cancer cell lines [4,24,26].
Chronic SWCNT-exposed BSW cells and passagecontrol BC cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 in the
presence or absence of fumitremorgin C (FTC), a specific
inhibitor of ABCG2 transporter. SP cells, which disappear
in the presence of FTC, were identified by FACS and

calculated as a proportion (percentage) of the pool
population. The results show that the SP fraction of BSW
cells was substantially higher than that of the BC cells
(~15% vs. 3%), and was comparable to that of the wellestablished non-small cell lung carcinoma H460 cells,
which served as a positive control in this study (Figure
1C). As an additional measure to substantiate the existence
of CSCs, we determined CD 133 expression, one of the
key biomarkers of lung CSCs [27,28], in BC, BSW, and
H460 cells. Figure 1D shows that CD133 expression
was high in BSW and H460 cells, but not in BC cells.
Altogether, these results supported the notion that BSW
cells were enriched with CSCs.

FACS enables the isolation of CSCs from their
parental cells based on their SP phenotype. To first ensure
the basis of SP analysis, we determined the expression
level of ABCG2 transporter in BSW cells in comparison
with control BC cells. As depicted in Figure 2A, ABCG2
expression was highly upregulated in BSW cells. We then
isolated CSCs and their non-CSC counterpart from BSW
cells using FACS and designated them as SP and non-SP
(NSP) cells, respectively. To validate the stem phenotype
of the isolated cells, we assessed their Hoechst dye uptake
characteristic using fluorescence microscopy. Figure 2B
shows that Hoechst fluorescence intensity was less in the
SP compared to NSP cells. We also observed a staining

pattern that we called ring-shape pattern in the SP cells
(Figure 2B-arrows), in which the Hoechst dye cannot
completely stain SP nuclei, indicating their ability to
efflux the dye. We next subjected freshly isolated SP and
NSP cells to tumor sphere and soft agar assays, the gold
standards for assessing CSC and malignant properties. The
results indicated that the SP cells formed larger and greater
number of spheres and colonies than the NSP cells (Figure
2C and D), indicating their CSC features and validity of

the CSC isolation. The observation that the NSP cells
which accounted for the vast majority of sorted cells but
lacked substantial ability to form tumor colonies suggested
the role of SP cells (CSCs) as tumor-initiating cells. The
greater tumorigenicity of SP cells was subsequently
confirmed in vivo using a xenograft mouse model, where
they exhibited greater tumor incidence, size, and volume
(Figure 3A and B).

SP cells display an aggressive cancer behavior
The aggressive neoplastic behavior of CSCs was
assessed by cell migration, invasion, and apoptosis
assays. Freshly isolated SP and NSP cells were seeded
onto Transwell chambers with control inserts (migration)
or Matrigel-coated inserts (invasion) and incubated for 48
hours. The results showed that the SP cells exhibited a
significant increase in migration and invasion activities as
compared to NSP cells (Figure 4A and B). This increase
in cellular activities was not due to the difference in cell
growth since the growth rate of SP and NSP cells was
comparable at 48 hours as determined by MTT assay (data

not shown). We next compared the apoptosis resistance
of SP and NSP cells in response to TNF-α, a known
apoptosis inducer of BC cells [12]. Figure 4C shows that
TNF-α induced less apoptosis in the SP than NSP cells as
demonstrated by their reduced nuclear condensation and
fragmentation. These results indicate that CSCs acquired
enhanced cell motility and apoptosis resistance, which are
important in tumorigenesis and metastasis.

transcription profiles of BSW cells and their passagecontrol BC cells using microarray analysis. We identified
1932 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between
BSW and BC cells with fold change ≥ 2 and p-value ≤
0.05, of which 693 genes were upregulated and 1239
genes were downregulated, as shown as red points in the
volcano plot (Figure 5A). Gene ontology analysis using
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Qiagen, Redwood City,
CA) revealed cancer as a top-ranked disease, cell growth/
proliferation as a top-ranked cellular function, and TP53,
the most frequently altered gene in human cancers [29],
as a top-ranked upstream regulator (Figure 5B). These
results are consistent with our functional assays showing
that BSW cells possess aggressive tumorigenic properties.
To determine the potential regulator(s) of
tumorigenesis and metastasis, which are important
features of CSCs, we performed IPA functional analysis
of tumorigenesis (p-value 8.74×10-4) and metastasis of
lung cells (p-value 8.00×10-4) based on their DEG profiles.
Figure 6A shows that CAV1, with an approximately 2.5fold increase in BSW cells, is a dominant molecule for
both networks. Tumorigenesis and metastasis-promoting
gene signaling network (GSN) showed that CAV1
occupied a focal position of the GSN, while other hub
genes with first order linkage to CAV1 include MYC,
CCND1, IL6, and FN1 (Figure 6B). These findings
indicate the importance of CAV1 in BSW tumorigenesis
and metastasis, which may be associated with the CSCs.
Oxidative stress, the second top-ranked toxicological
responses on the IPA (p-value 2.53×10-5), has been shown
to be induced in the tumor microenvironment [30,31] and
has been suggested to play a vital role in tumorigenesis
and metastasis [32,33]. Here we show that treatment of
the cells with SWCNTs (0-0.15 μg/cm2) induced a doseand time-dependent increase in cellular DCF fluorescence,
an indicator of cellular ROS generation and oxidative
stress, in BC cells (Figure 7A). An addition of antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 5mM) inhibited the oxidative
effect of SWCNTs (0.15 μg/cm2) (Figure 7A-left), thus
confirming the induction of ROS by SWCNTs.

Gene profiling identifies Cav-1 as an important
regulator of tumorigenesis and metastasis
To gain a better insight into the mechanisms
underlying the phenotypic changes of chronic SWCNTexposed BSW cells, we compared the genome-wide

To understand the underlying mechanisms of CSC
induction by SWCNTs, we investigated the potential
role of p53 and Cav-1 since they are known regulators of
lung carcinogenesis [34,35] and are key targets of ROS
[21,22,36]. Their potential role in BSW tumorigenesis
was also suggested by IPA. Figure 7B shows that p53 was
strikingly downregulated in SP cells with the rank order
of expression being BC > NSP > SP. In contrast, Cav-1
expression was highest in the SP cells followed by NSP
and BC cells (SP > NSP > BC). To further investigate
the functional role of p53 and Cav-1 in CSC induction,
we manipulated their expression by gene transfection in
chronic SWCNT-exposed BSW cells and studied their

effect on SP phenotype. Stably transfected cells were
stained with Hoechst 33342 in the presence or absence of
ABCG2 inhibitor FTC, and SP fractions were determined
as earlier described. Figure 7C shows that overexpression
of p53 significantly inhibited SP, whereas overexpression
of Cav-1 promoted SP as compared to parental BSW cells.
These results indicate the involvement of p53 and Cav-1 in
the CSC acquisition of SWCNT-treated cells.
To confirm the role of p53 and Cav-1 in CSC
regulation, tumor sphere formation assays were performed
on the genetically manipulated cells. Figure 8A shows that
the p53-overexpressing cells formed smaller and fewer
number of tumor spheres, while the Cav-1-overexpressing
cells exhibited larger and greater number of tumor spheres
as compared to vector-transfected BSW control cells, thus
validating the inhibitory role of p53 and the promoting
role of Cav-1 in the CSC induction by SWCNTs.

To confirm the role of Cav-1 in the tumorigenicity
of BSW cells, we assessed tumor growth and progression
in vivo using a xenograft mouse model. To link Cav-1 to
CSC regulation, we transfected the parental BSW cells,
which express a low level of Cav-1 relative to their CSC
subpopulation, with Cav-1 or control plasmid. Cav-1overexpressing and control-transfected cells were then
genetically labeled with luciferase (Capital Biosciences,
Rockville, MD) and subcutaneously injected into NSG
mice at 3×105 cells/flank. Injection of the control BC cells
at the same (3×105 cells) or higher (1×106 cells) doses
did not induce tumor formation in NSG mice (data not
shown). Tumor growth was monitored weekly by using
IVIS® bioluminescence imaging. By three weeks postinjection, the tumor luminescence was strikingly higher
in mice bearing Cav-1-overexpressing cells as compared
to control cells (Figure 9A), indicating the positive
regulatory role of Cav-1 on tumor growth. Quantitative
analysis of the tumor luminescence signals over time
was shown in Figure 9B. For comparison, these signals
were normalized to their initial signals at the time of
inoculation (week 0). Figure 9C shows that the tumor
signals were significantly higher in mice bearing Cav-1overexpressing cells at 3 and 4 weeks post-injection. The
maximum of approximately 4-fold tumor induction was
observed with Cav-1-overexpressing cells over control
cells, substantiating the tumor promoting role of Cav-1. At
the end of the experiment (week 5), subcutaneous tumors
were dissected and tumor weight was compared between
groups. The greater weight of Cav-1-overexpressing
tumors further supported Cav-1 as a positive regulator
of tumorigenesis (Figure 9D). Histological analysis of
subcutaneous Cav-1-overexpressing tumors by H&E
staining showed a classical cancer cell morphology
including the condensation of heterochromatin and the
presence of multinucleated cells, an indicator of mitotic
dysfunction (Figure 9E-b).
Interestingly, we observed a remarkable tumor
bioluminescence in mice bearing Cav-1-overexpressing
cells after the dissection of subcutaneous tumors (Figure
9E-a). Histological analysis of neighboring muscle tissues
showed metastatic cells in the muscle tissues of mice
bearing Cav-1-overexpressing cells (Figure 9E-c). This
result indicates metastasis of Cav-1-overpressing cells to
neighboring tissues, which is consistent with the in vitro
result showing the increased aggressiveness of cells by
Cav-1 (Figure 8B), and suggests an important role of Cav1 in tumor metastasis.

Role of p53 and Cav-1 in cell aggressiveness
Having shown that the CSCs acquired aggressive
cancer phenotypes, we determined whether overexpression
of p53 and Cav-1 affect cell aggressiveness by analyzing
cell migration using Transwell migration assay. Figure
8B shows that cell migration was substantially reduced
in p53-overexpressing cells as compared to vectortransfected control cells, while Cav-1-overexpressing
cells exhibited increased migratory activity. These results
indicate the role of p53 and Cav-1 in cell aggressiveness
and strengthen their role in CSC regulation.

Regulation of p53 by Cav-1 in SWCNT-treated
cells
Previous studies showed that an increased
expression of Cav-1 abrogated p53 activation in breast
cancer cells induced by cell detachment through an upregulation of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) receptor
[37]. In this study, we similarly observed the inverse
correlation between Cav-1 and p53 in SP and NSP cells
(Figure 7B). To test the potential regulatory axis of the
two molecular regulators in controlling CSC induction,
we genetically altered Cav-1 expression in BSW cells
by stable gene transfection and studied its effect on p53
expression. Figure 8C shows that an overexpression
of Cav-1 resulted in a decrease in p53 expression as
compared to control-transfected cells. To confirm the
above finding, gene knockdown experiments were
conducted in BSW cells. The cells were transfected with
Cav-1 shRNA viral particles and analyzed for Cav-1 and
p53 expression. Figure 8D shows that as compared to
control-transfected cells, the shCav-1-transfected cells
exhibited substantially higher p53 expression. Together,
these results indicate Cav-1 as a negative regulator of p53
in BSW cells.

linkage to CAV1 (Figure 6B). Cav-1 overexpression
and inhibition have previously shown to mediate c-Myc
level in prostate cancer cell lines through the interaction
between Cav-1 and low-density lipoprotein receptorrelated protein 6 (LRP6) [46]. Likewise, c-Myc is a
known downstream target of p53 at the transcriptional and
posttranscriptional levels [47,48]. With its unique structure
of lipid microdomains, Cav-1 interacts with multidrug
resistance ABCG2 transporter protein and regulates its
transporting activity [49,50]. As SP phenotype of CSCs is
attributed to the expression of ABCG2, it is plausible that
Cav-1 might also regulate CSCs through ABCG2 protein.
Having demonstrated that Cav-1 contributed to CSC
regulation and malignancy induced by chronic SWCNT
exposure in vitro, we determined the role of Cav-1 in
tumor growth and progression in vivo. Our data showed
that Cav-1 not only promoted tumor formation but also
metastasis of the tumor cells to neighboring tissues (Figure
9). The tumor-promoting effect of Cav-1 in SWCNTtransformed cells is similar to that observed in human
lung cancer cell lines [51], indicating a potential shared
mechanism between laboratory SWCNT-driven tumors
and human lung cancer.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that
SWCNTs are capable of inducing CSCs and tumorigenesis
in a xenograft mouse model. This study also unveiled
the positive regulatory role of Cav-1 in the tumorigenic
process. This protein is overexpressed in chronic SWCNTexposed lung cells, particularly in the CSC subpopulation,
and is a key contributing factor to the malignant and
aggressive properties of the cells. Cav-1 acts upstream of
p53 resulting in its inactivation, the event that is common
in most human cancers [27]. By linking Cav-1, CSCs and
tumorigenesis, we documented a novel mechanism of
Cav-1 that drives SWCNT tumorigenesis possibly through
CSC acquisition. As induction of CSCs is an early event
in carcinogen-induced pre-malignancy [38], detection of
Cav-1 might aid in the early diagnosis and prevention of
CNT-induced lung carcinogenesis.

associated with chronic pulmonary exposure to CNTs.
We report here that chronic exposure of non-tumorigenic
human lung epithelial cells to SWCNTs, a major form of
engineered CNTs, can directly initiate the formation of
lung CSCs, as indicated by tumor sphere and SP assays
(Figure 1). The acquisition of these CSCs is important
for their malignant and aggressive properties. This
conclusion is based on the observations that the isolated
CSCs (SP cells) formed much larger colonies and spheres
under soft agar and tumor sphere assays (Figure 2), had
greater tumor-initiating capability in vivo (Figure 3), and
possessed increased migratory and invasive activities as
well as apoptosis resistance phenotype as compared to
non-CSCs (NSP cells) (Figure 4). Consistent with this
finding, a recent study similarly reported the acquisition
of stem-like properties by lung epithelial cells chronically
exposed to tobacco and arsenic carcinogens [38,39] with
enhanced cell motility [38]. Thus, these results may
reflect common cellular responses to chronic carcinogen
exposure.
ROS are known to play a key role in tumor
development as they may cause damage to DNA,
RNA and proteins, leading to changes in chromosome
instability, gene mutation and altered gene expression
[32]. SWCNTs induced a significant level of ROS, the
effect of which inhibited by antioxidant NAC (Figure 7A).
In response to chronic SWCNT exposure, we observed the
striking alterations of tumor regulators and ROS targeted
proteins, including downregulation of tumor suppressor
p53 and upregulation of tumor promoter Cav-1 (Figure
7B), consistent with their suggested role by IPA gene
ontology analysis. Using gene manipulation, we revealed
for the first time the involvement of p53 and Cav-1 in CSC
acquisition and cell aggressiveness induced by SWCNTs
(Figure 7C, 8A and B). It has been recently demonstrated
that wild-type p53 positively regulated cell differentiation
in breast cancer cells and loss of p53 favored CSC growth
[40,41]. However, the functional role of Cav-1 in CSC
induction is not known. Our study provides the first
initial evidence for the tumor promoting activity of Cav-1
through CSC regulation. Furthermore, we found that Cav1 acts upstream of p53 in mediating the effect (Figure 8C
and D). Overexpression of Cav-1 leads to p53 inactivation
in the tested cell system, consistent with the earlier finding
in breast cancer cells [35]. By contrast, p53 was activated
upon Cav-1 inhibition by shRNA knockdown. In addition
to the regulatory role of ROS in Cav-1 expression [22],
the feedback antioxidant function of Cav-1 was reported
in human lung cancer cells [42]. As p53 activation is
generally triggered by ROS [34], it is plausible that the
observed p53 inactivation may result from the antioxidant

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CNT characterization and preparation
SWCNTs
were
obtained
from
Carbon
Nanotechnology (CNI, Houston, Texas) and were
purified by acid treatment to remove metal contaminates.
Elemental analysis by nitric acid dissolution and inductive
coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICPAES) showed that the purified SWCNT contained 99%
elemental carbon and less than 1% of contaminants. The
metal residues were mostly iron (Fe) at 0.23% by weight.
The surface area, length, and width of individual dry
SWCNT were 400-1040 m2/g, 0.6 ± 0.5 μm, and 1 ± 0.2

nm (W), respectively [52]. SWCNTs were dispersed by
using acetone/sonication method as previously described
[12].

AGTCAATCTTGACCACGTCTTTTT-3’) and control
nontarget sequence(5’-CCGGCAACAAGATGAAGAGC
ACCAACTCGAGTTGGTGCTCTTCATCTTGTTGTTT
TT-3’) were used to knockdown Cav-1 expression in BSW
cells. The viral vectors were obtained commercially from
Sigma (accession numbers NM_001753 and SHC002V)
and were used according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates (5×105/well)
and incubated with Cav-1 shRNA lentiviral particles
at the multiplicity of infection of 1.5 in the presence
of hexadimethrine bromide (8 μg/mL) for 36 hours.
Transfected cells were analyzed for Cav-1 by Western
blotting prior to use.

Chemicals and reagents
Hoechst 33342, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC),
dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA), and
antibody against β-actin were obtained from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). TNF-α was obtained from
EMD Biosciences (La Jolla, CA). Antibody against Cav1 and p53 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against peroxidase-labeled
secondary antibody were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology (Boston, MA).

Chronic CNT exposure and derivation of CNTtransformed cells

Cell culture

Non-tumorigenic human lung epithelial BEAS2B cells were continuously exposed to non-cytotoxic
SWCNTs at 0.02 μg/cm2 in culture for 6 months. This
dose, which is equivalent to a human lung burden for 8
hours/day over a month at 400 μg/m3 (high CNT level
reported in a research facility) [53] or about 3 years at
10 μg/m3 (average CNT level in U.S. facilities) [54], was
calculated from the lowest dose which induced positive
in vivo biological response (10 μg/mouse lung). The cells
were passaged weekly at preconfluent densities using a
solution containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.5 mM EDTA
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). SWCNT-exposed BEAS2B cells were designated as BSW cells. Parallel cultures
grown in CNT-free medium with the same background
level of dispersant provided passage-matched control and
were designated as BC cells. After 6 months of exposure,
the cells were cultured in normal complete medium,
and their cancer and CSC phenotypes were assessed as
described below.

Human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC;
Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with
5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100
units/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco,
Gaithersburg, MA). Non-small cell lung cancer H460
cells were obtained from ATCC and were cultured in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 2 mM
L-glutamine, and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin.
Both cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2 at 37 °C.

Plasmid and transfection
Cav-1, p53, and control GFP plasmids were obtained
from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Cells were transfected
with Cav-1, p53, or GFP plasmid by nucleofection using
Nucleofector® (Amexa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
cells were suspended in 100 μL of nucleofection solution
with 2 μg of plasmid and nucleofected using the device
program T020. The cells were then resuspended in
500 μL of complete medium and seeded in 60-mm cell
culture dishes. Cells were allowed to recover for 48 hours
before each experiment and were cultured for 28 days in
G418-containing medium (800 μg/mL). The pool stable
transfectant was identified by Western blotting of Cav-1
and p53 and was cultured in the G418-free medium for at
least three passages before each experiment.

Soft agar colony formation assay
Passage-control BC and chronic SWCNT-exposed
BSW cells (3×104 cells) were mixed with culture medium
containing 0.5% agar to a final agar concentration of
0.33%. Cell suspensions were immediately plated onto
dishes coated with 0.5% agar in culture medium. Colonies
were examined under a light microscope after 2 weeks
of culture. In order to assess the self-renewing property
of cells, spheres were collected by gentle centrifugation,
dissociated into single cell suspensions, filtered and
cultured under conditions described above (second
spheres).

Tumor sphere assay

invading cells were removed from the inside of the insert
with a cotton swab. Cells that migrated or invaded to the
underside of the membrane were fixed and stained with
10 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 for 30 minutes. Inserts were
visualized and scored under a fluorescence microscope
(Leica DM, IL). Cell migration and invasion was
expressed as the ratio of migrated or invaded cells from
the treated and control sample (relative level).

Tumor sphere assay was performed under nonadherent and serum-free conditions as previously
described as stem cell-selective conditions [24,25].
Briefly, cells were resuspended in 0.8% methylcellulose
(MC)-based serum-free medium (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, Canada) supplemented with 20 ng/mL
epidermal growth factor (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA), basic fibroblast growth factor and 4 mg/mL insulin
(Sigma) and plated at 5×103 cells. Cells were then cultured
for two weeks.

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was determined by DNA condensation/
fragmentation assay using Hoechst 33342 dye. Cells were
incubated with 10 μg/mL of Hoechst 33342 for 30 minutes
and visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL). Cells having intensely
condensed and/or fragmented nuclei were considered
apoptotic. Approximately 1000 nuclei from 10 random
fields were analyzed for each sample. The apoptotic index
was calculated as the percentage of cells with apoptotic
nuclei over total number of cells.

Side population analysis and isolation
Cells were detached by trypsinization and 1×106
cells were labeled with 5 μg/mL of Hoechst 33342 in
DMEM-F12 medium containing 2% FBS in the presence
or absence of 25 μM ABCG2 inhibitor fumitremorgin C
(FTC; EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) at 37 °C for 90
minutes. The cells were then centrifuged and resuspended
in ice-cold Hank’s buffer salt solution (HBSS). Side
population (SP) analysis and sorting were performed using
BD FACSAria fluorescence-activating (flow cytometry)based cell sorter (FACS; BD Biosciences). The Hoechst
dye was excited with a UV laser and its fluorescence was
measured with both a 450/20 filter (Hoechst Blue) and 675
LP filter (Hoechst Red). SP fraction was calculated based
on the disappearance of SP cells in the presence of FTC
using the formula: SP percentage in the absence of FTC −
SP percentage in the presence of FTC.

Whole genome expression microarray and gene
ontology analysis
Whole genome expression was determined using
high-throughput mRNA microarray analysis following
MIAME guidelines as described previously [48]. Briefly,
cells (1×106 in 6-cm plate) were lysed in triplicate using
TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY),
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and shipped overnight to
ArrayStar (Rockville, MD). Total RNA was isolated,
purified and quantified using Nanodrop ND-1000 (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL). RNA was tested for purity
and DNA contamination using A260/A280 ration and
standard denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. Gene
expression profiling was performed using NimbleGen
Human 12×135k Gene Expression Array using the
NimbleGen Hybridization System (Roche NimbleGen,
Madison, WI). The slides were scanned with Axon
GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Molecular Devices
Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). Raw data intensities were
extracted from the aligned scanned images and normalized
through quantile normalization and Robust Multichip
Average method in NimbleGen v2.5. Gene level files
were imported into Agilent GeneSpring GX (v12.1) for
analysis. Genes with < 50.0 intensity were removed from
further analysis. Volcano plots were constructed using
two sample t-tests (p ≤ 0.05) and ± 2-fold change filter
criteria to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
in chronic SWCNT-exposed BSW cells compare to
control BC cells. All gene expression data were deposited
to NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus and is accessible
via accession number (GenBank ID: GSE56104). Gene
ontology, gene network, and upstream prediction analysis

Hoechst uptake
Cells were directly stained with 5 μg/mL of Hoechst
33342 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in the culture
plates at 37°C for 30 minutes. Hoechst 33342 blue uptake
was analyzed by fluorescence microscope using a 350-nm
excitation and 450-nm emission beam.

Cell migration and invasion assays
In vitro cell migration and invasion were determined
using a 24-well Transwell® unit with polycarbonate
(PVDF) filters (8-μm pore size). The membrane was
coated with Matrigel® (BD Biosciences, NJ) for the
invasion assay, while control inserts were used for the
migration assay. Briefly, cells at the density of 3×104 cells
per well (invasion) or 1.5×104 cells per well (migration)
were seeded into the upper chamber of the Transwell®
unit in serum-free medium. The lower chamber of the
unit was filled with a normal growth medium containing
5% FBS. Chambers were incubated at 37 °C in a 5%
CO2 atmosphere for 48 hours. The non-migrating or nonwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Qiagen, Redwood City, CA).

ROS generation was determined fluorometrically
using H2DCF-DA as a fluorescent probe. Briefly, cells
were incubated with the probe (10 μM) for 30 min at 37°C,
after which they were washed and resuspended in PBS,
followed by analysis of cellular fluorescence intensity by
a fluorescence plate reader at the excitation and emission
wavelengths of 485 and 538 nm, respectively.

signs of distress such as weight loss, hunching, failure to
groom, and red discharge from the eyes. Tumor growth
of luciferase-labeled cells was monitored weekly by
using in vivo IVIS® imaging. At the end of experiments,
mice were euthanized and tumors were dissected and
weighted. Tumor specimens were cut into 5-μm sections
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to confirm
the cancer-specific morphology and cellular structure.
Tumor metastasis to neighbor tissues was analyzed by
IVIS® imaging after removal of primary SC tumors. All
tissue sectioning and staining were performed at the West
Virginia University Pathology Laboratory for Translational
Medicine.

Western blot analysis

Statistical analysis

After specific treatments, cells were incubated
in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5),
1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM
Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, and a commercial protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) at 4 °C
for 20 minutes. The lysate was collected and determined
for protein content using the Bradford method (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Proteins (40 μg) were
resolved under denaturing conditions by 7.5-12% sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
(Bio-Rad). The transferred membranes were blocked for
1 hour in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (25 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.4, 125 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated
with the appropriate primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight.
Membranes were washed twice with TBST for 10 minutes
and incubated with HRP-coupled isotype-specific
secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature.
The immune complexes were detected by an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system and quantified using
analyst/PC densitometry software.

The data represent means ± SD from three or more
independent experiments as indicated. Statistical analysis
was performed by Student’s t test at a significance level
of p < 0.05.
