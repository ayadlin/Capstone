of Therapy-Resistant Cancer?

Summary
A series of recent reports has suggested PGC1α-driven upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation as a selective vulnerability of drug-resistant cancers. Accordingly, chemical
inhibitors of respiration led to selective eradication of such cancer cells due to their preferential
sensitivity to mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species. These novel insights create a
timely opportunity for a biomarker guided application of already existing and newly emerging
mitochondrial inhibitors in recurrent drug resistant cancer, including lymphomas, melanomas, and
other malignant diseases marked by increased mitochondrial respiration.

Therapy-Selected Quiescence (TSQ)
Author Manuscript

Current cancer therapeutics have extraordinary efficiency and selectivity, often killing
essentially 100% of malignant cells in a culture dish at a dose where normal cells are spared.
In vivo, it appears that induction of cell death is never complete. Surviving cells may no
longer proliferate but persist in a quiescent or slow-cycling state for years. This phenotype
may have either preexisted in a subset of cells from the heterogeneous tumor mass (e.g.
“cancer stem cells”) or may have been acquired as a consequence of the cytotoxic treatment.
Either way, it is now well established that the very same therapeutic regimen, whether
cytotoxic or “targeted”, can drive both apoptotic cell death and selection of therapy resistant
quiescent or slow cycling cells, a process I will refer to as therapy-selected quiescence
(TSQ). Cells undergoing TSQ may be thought of as “cancer memory cells” that build a
reservoir to fuel cancer recurrence (Fig. 1A).

Author Manuscript

One well established form of TSQ is therapy-induced senescence (TIS). Common therapies
such as radiation and genotoxic chemotherapy trigger either apoptosis or TIS with the
specific response being determined by the dose. High doses cause cell death whereas lower
doses induce TIS. The heterogeneity of the tumor environment may lead to gradients in drug
exposure that enable the co-existence of both therapeutic responses. Senescence is mediated
and maintained by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors - p16Ink4a (CDKN2A), p21WAF1,CIP1
(CDKN1A), and p27KIP1 (CDKN1B) - that are induced downstream of tumor suppressor

pathways including p53- and RB1-related proteins (Schmitt et al., 2002). However, TIS also
occurs in the absence of these tumor suppressor pathways because they are frequently
defective in cancer cells that undergo TIS (Ewald et al., 2010). TIS may be a double-edged
sword: On the upside, cellular senescence constitutes a barrier against malignant
progression. On the downside, the long-term persistence of senescent cancer cells carries
liabilities associated with their pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype (Coppé et al., 2010)
and risks such as their resistance to apoptosis and their potential for re-entering the cell cycle
(Roberson et al., 2005). Melanomas arising from nevi are good examples for escape of
oncogene-driven cells from senescence (Dhomen et al., 2009). A related paradigm is slowcycling stem-like cancer cells. Like TIS cells, slow cycling cells are drug resistant (Dean et
al., 2005) and can therefore be selected with various cytotoxic agents ((Roesch et al., 2013)
and sections below). Reactivation of therapy-selected quiescent tumor cells might therefore
contribute to a significant portion of relapses after therapy.

Author Manuscript

Eradicating cancer cells escaping drug-induced apoptosis by entering a TSQ state would
therefore appear an important goal in cancer therapy. This ambition hardly meshes with our
limited knowledge of specific vulnerabilities of quiescent/slow-cycling tumor cells that
could be targeted for therapy. Several recent reports have presented data that strongly
suggest mitochondrial respiration as a specific vulnerability of TSQ cells, which when
exploited should be synthetically lethal with established cytotoxic therapies (Corazao-Rozas
et al., 2013; Dörr et al., 2013; Haq et al., 2013; Roesch et al., 2013).

Increased Mitochondrial Activity in Quiescent/Slow Cycling Cancer Cells

Author Manuscript

As originally discovered by Otto Warburg, rapidly proliferating cancer cells are typically
marked by high rates of aerobic glycolysis, a metabolic change that is exploited today in
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of tumors. This property is a universal
hallmark shared by all rapidly dividing eukaryotic cells including single celled yeasts.
Quiescent cells, in contrast, appear to rely on complete oxidation of pyruvate to CO2 to meet
their ATP demands. Aerobic glycolysis, in addition to other metabolic changes, may serve
to optimally support the anabolic requirements of proliferating cancer cells (Lunt and
Vander Heiden, 2011; Ward and Thompson, 2012). It enables cancer cells to divert glucose
carbon from mitochondrial ATP production to the synthesis of biomolecules needed for
biomass accumulation and cell division. In the simplest scenario, one might predict that the
metabolism of TSQ cells resembles that of resting normal cells (i.e. high rate of
mitochondrial respiration) rather than that of the proliferating tumor cells from which they
were selected (anaerobic glycolysis). Recent studies have shown that this is true – at least
for some TSQ cells.

Author Manuscript

Lymphoma cells undergoing TIS were found to be metabolically hyperactive, a remarkable
finding in light of their non-proliferative state (Dörr et al., 2013). Eμ-myc lymphoma cells
rendered incompetent for apoptosis by overexpression of BCL2, responded to treatment with
cyclophosphamide or adriamycin by uniformly undergoing TIS as indicated by decreased
BrdU incorporation and positivity for senescence-associated β-galactosidase (Dörr et al.,
2013). Consistent with their TIS phenotype, these tumors are quiescent in vivo as shown by
undetectable signals in [18F] fluorothymidine PET. Unexpectedly, however, these drug-

treated TIS tumors exhibit a stronger signal than untreated tumors in [18F]
fluorodeoxyglucose PET, indicating that they have increased glucose uptake. In vitro, the
Eμ-myc;BCL2 lymphoma cells also show increased glucose uptake and metabolism to
pyruvate and lactate. At first sight, it thus appears that TIS reinforces the Warburg effect.

Author Manuscript

However, Eμ-myc;BCL2 lymphoma cells undergoing TIS also showed several signs
untypical of the Warburg effect: (i.) They not only accumulated lactate but also citrate,
indicating that TIS cells also increased flux into the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle; (ii.)
They upregulated isoform 1 of pyruvate kinase (PKM1) thus providing abundant fuel for the
TCA cycle; and (iii.) They activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling,
suggesting that their energy demand is greater than what can be met through anaerobic
glycolysis. All three findings indicated that unlike with proliferating cancer cells, increased
glucose utilization of TIS cells drives the TCA cycle that feeds into mitochondrial
respiration. Consistent with this interpretation are the observations that mitochondrial
oxygen consumption rate and intracellular ATP levels were strongly increased in Eμmyc;BCL2 lymphoma cells undergoing TIS. These cells display a hybrid form of energy
metabolism, marked by high levels of glucose utilization, mitochondrial respiration and fatty
acid oxidation, apparently geared toward maximizing ATP production.

Author Manuscript

Similar upregulation of mitochondrial respiration was found in drug selected slow-cycling
cancer cells which are required for continuous maintenance of melanomas (Roesch et al.,
2010). JARID1B/KDM5B is a histone 3 K4 demethylase that is highly expressed in benign
nevi which undergo oncogene-induced senescence (Dhomen et al., 2009); but it is
downregulated in primary and metastatic melanomas (Roesch et al., 2005). Due to tumor
heterogeneity, a small portion of melanoma cells typically retains JARID1B expression,
however. Even subpopulations of cultured melanoma cell lines switch to a JARID1Bhigh
phenotype in an apparently stochastic fashion (Gupta et al., 2011; Roesch et al., 2010).
These JARID1Bhigh cells cycle very slowly but have increased self-renewal capacity, stem
cell-like properties, and are required for melanoma maintenance in vitro and in vivo (Roesch
et al., 2010). Like TIS cells, slow cycling JARID1Bhigh cells are drug resistant and can
therefore be selected with various cytotoxic agents (cisplatin, bortezomib, vemurafenib,
temozolomide etc.) (Roesch et al., 2013). Proteomic profiling of these cells revealed a
striking upregulation of proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration (OXPHOS),
including subunits of complexes I, III, IV, and ATP synthase (Roesch et al., 2013). This
resulted in increased oxygen consumption, increased mitochondrial ATP levels, and
increased production of H2O2.

Author Manuscript

In summary, an unexpected common denominator of these scenarios of therapy-selected
quiescence is metabolic re-programming to upregulate OXPHOS genes and increase oxygen
consumption and ATP production (Dörr et al., 2013; Roesch et al., 2013).

Increased Energy Demand of Cancer Cells Undergoing Therapy-Induced
Senescence
Why is the energy demand of seemingly quiescent cancer cells so high that it cannot be met
without upregulating mitochondrial activity? It turns out that the TIS cells studied by Dörr et

al. have ramped up three highly energy consuming pathways: Protein synthesis and folding,
protein ubiquitylation, and proteasomal degradation.

Author Manuscript

Various forms of senescence are known to coincide with the so-called senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP), a NFκB driven program to synthesize copious amounts of
secretory proteins (Chien et al., 2011; Coppé et al., 2010; Freund et al., 2011). Increased
protein synthesis and flux through the secretory pathway put high demands on the protein
folding capacity of chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When this capacity is
exhausted, ER stress will result, which leads to induction of the unfolded protein response
(UPR) (Cao and Kaufman, 2012; Walter and Ron, 2011). Eμ-myc;BCL2 lymphoma cells
undergoing TIS show a strong induction of the UPR. UPR signaling sets into motion a
program that directs either adaptation or cell death (Kim et al., 2008; Tabas and Ron, 2011).
The adaptive response is geared toward increasing the ER protein folding capacity through
induction of chaperones and the removal of unfolded proteins by upregulating ER-associated
degradation through the proteasome and autophagy pathways. The apoptotic response,
which may be a consequence of sustained, irreparable ER stress, involves several
mitochondria-dependent and independent pathways (Kim et al., 2008; Tabas and Ron,
2011). Of particular importance are the UPR-induced transcription factors ATF4 and CHOP,
which stimulate protein synthesis, causing ATP depletion, oxidative stress, and apoptotic
cell death (Han et al., 2013).

Author Manuscript

Despite UPR activation and strong induction of ATF4 and CHOP, Eμ-myc:BCL2 lymphoma
cells in TIS do not undergo apoptosis. This could be due to a combination of factors such as
overexpression of BCL2, induction of NFκB (as a result of SASP), and maintenance of high
ATP levels due to upregulation of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Instead of
inducing apoptosis, UPR signaling may reinforce or even drive the quiescent state of TIS
cells in the absence of functional p53 and RB1 tumor suppressor pathways. For example, the
UPR is known to suppress cyclin D1 synthesis via phosphorylation of eIF2α (Brewer et al.,
1999). Nevertheless, it is likely that TIS cells live on the edge with respect to pro-apoptotic
signaling.
Whether the increased mitochondrial respiration occurring in drug-resistant slow cycling
stem-like cancer cells (Roesch et al., 2013) sustains a similar anabolic secretory program as
found in TIS cells is currently unknown as is the status of UPR signaling in these cells. It is
noteworthy, however, that just like TIS cells, stem-like cancer cells are known to display
increased NFκB activity, which could potentially drive a secretory program (Fulda, 2013).

How is OXPHOS Upregulated in Response to Therapy?
Author Manuscript

Yet another recent example of drug-induced OXPHOS, again in melanoma, has shed light
on this important question. Upregulation of OXPHOS genes and an increase in
mitochondrial biogenesis and ATP levels was found to coincide with BRAF(V600E) mutant
melanomas acquiring resistance to BRAF inhibitors (Haq et al., 2013). OXPHOS
upregulation was found to occur via microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF),
a melanocyte-lineage transcription factor and bona de melanoma oncogene (Garraway et al.,
2005). MITF directly drives the expression of proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)

coactivator-1α (PGC1α, PPARGC1A) (Fig. 1b), a known master regulator of mitochondrial
biogenesis (Scarpulla et al., 2012). In fact, 10% of human melanomas overexpress MITF
and PGC1α and OXPHOS genes and have increased respiration even without BRAF
inhibitor treatment (Vazquez et al., 2013). Genetic evidence demonstrates that such tumors
depend on PGC1α for survival and tumor progression. In addition, MITF/PGC1α-dependent
OXPHOS upregulation confers resistance to cancer drugs whose mechanism-of-action
involves apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Vazquez et al., 2013).

Author Manuscript

It is tempting to speculate that TIS and slow cycling stem-like cancer cells also invoke
PGC1α induction to upregulate mitochondrial respiration. For example, Eμ-myc lymphoma
cells undergoing TIS show phosphorylation of adenosine mono-phosphate (AMP)-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) (Dörr et al., 2013), a known activator of PGC1α (Scarpulla et al.,
2012). However, not all melanomas resistant to BRAF inhibition upregulate OXPHOS via
PGC1α (Corazao-Rozas et al., 2013). The remaining tumors may utilize some of the other
transcriptional pathways known to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, for example NRF1
(Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1) and NRF2 and/or MYC (Scarpulla et al., 2012). It is also
noteworthy that the small fraction of melanomas that are intrinsically resistant to BRAF
inhibition (as opposed to acquiring resistance in response to BRAF inhibition) are marked
by low rather than high MITF expression (Konieczkowski et al., 2014). Overall, the MITFPGC1α interplay is complex due to mutual feed-forward regulation (Ronai, 2013).

Reliance on Mitochondrial Respiration as a Cancer Selective Vulnerability

Author Manuscript

Exploiting the altered metabolism of cancer cells for therapy has become a widely accepted
concept (Schulze and Harris, 2012). The studies discussed here strongly suggest that
reliance on mitochondrial respiration may represent a previously unexpected “druggable”
vulnerability of (multi-)drug-resistant cancers. Minimally, this would apply to lymphomas
undergoing TIS in response to cytotoxic therapy (Dörr et al., 2013), to slow cycling
melanoma cells selected for a JARID1Bhigh phenotype by cytotoxic agents (Roesch et al.,
2013), and to BRAF-mutant melanomas escaping therapy with BRAF inhibitors (Haq et al.,
2013). These examples make a strong case for inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration to
combat drug-resistant cancer, especially melanomas and lymphomas.

Author Manuscript

Experimental support for this proposition is provided by the anti-tumor activity of genetic
ablation of OXPHOS components in melanomas (Vazquez et al., 2013). In addition, various
chemical inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration were able to overcome resistance to widely
used targeted and cytotoxic treatments (Table 1). Thus, mitochondrial inhibitors proved
effective for synthetic lethal targeting of drug resistant cancer cells marked by high
OXPHOS activity.
Whereas most of the mitochondrial inhibitors and decouplers employed in the above studies
have narrow therapeutic indices and are for laboratory use only, there is a sizeable collection
of clinically used drugs that inhibit the electron transport chain (ETC). These include, for
example, tamoxifen and metformin which inhibit complex I, resveratrol - a complex III
antagonist, and the complex V inhibitor 3,3-diindolylmethane (reviewed in (Rohlena et al.,
2011; Toogood, 2008). Metformin, in particular, was found highly effective against stem-

like cancer cells and to synergize with chemotherapeutics in the mouse (Hirsch et al., 2009;
Iliopoulos et al., 2011). In addition, there are a number of emerging mitochondrial inhibitors
that have been successfully used in rodent tumor studies with manageable toxicity, at least in
the short-term (Corazao-Rozas et al., 2013; Rico-Bautista et al., 2013; Rohlena et al., 2011).
These substances may merit future development into clinical candidates.

Mechanism of Action of Mitochondrial Inhibitors as Anti-cancer Agents

Author Manuscript

ATP levels may not be limiting for cancer cells (Scholnick et al., 1973). To the contrary,
some cancer cells engage various modes of dissipating ATP levels in order to alleviate
negative feedback inhibition on glycolysis, a mechanism required for efficient flux of
glucose carbon into macromolecular synthesis pathways (Fang et al., 2010; Heiden et al.,
2010). It is therefore unlikely that the cytotoxicity of OXPHOS inhibitors in the described
drug resistant settings arises from ATP depletion. Rather, cell death appears to result from
the deleterious effects of ROS. Indeed the pro-apoptotic activity of mitochondrial inhibitors
can be reversed by antioxidants (e.g. (Rico-Bautista et al., 2013; Sundberg et al., 2009;
Watabe and Nakaki, 2007), suggesting that oxidative stress rather than ATP depletion is the
primary trigger of apoptosis in response to ETC inhibition. At the same time, inhibition of
ROS detoxifying systems such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione or thioredoxins
would seem to bear potential in combination with mitochondrial inhibitors. Several
inhibitors of ROS detoxification are under development (Wondrak, 2009).

Author Manuscript

With regards to mechanism of action, it is well established that inhibition of ETC complexes
causes major leakage of electrons and subsequent superoxide and hydrogen peroxide
generation (reviewed in (Rohlena et al., 2011)). This is especially true for cancer cells that
have upregulated mitochondrial respiration (Corazao-Rozas et al., 2013; Vazquez et al.,
2013). Although small increases in ROS can be pro-tumorigenic due to damage to
macromolecules, high levels of ROS induce apoptosis through various mechanisms,
including permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane and cytochrome C release
(Madesh and Hajnóczky, 2001) as well as induction of the UPR (Rico-Bautista et al., 2013)
(Fig. 1B), which is known to engage in a self-reinforcing cycle with oxidative stress
(Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007). This “threshold concept” of ROS activity and the
preferential sensitivity of cancer cells toward apoptosis induced by high levels of ROS is
now widely established and provides a solid basis for cancer selectivity of mitochondrial
inhibitors (reviewed in (Kong et al., 2000; Luo et al., 2009; Trachootham et al., 2009;
Watson, 2013; Wondrak, 2009).

Which Cancer Patients Might Benefit from Mitochondrial Inhibitors?
Author Manuscript

If these concepts are well established in the basic science literature, why have mitochondrial
inhibitors been slow in coming in the clinic? One reason may be that it has been challenging
to predict which patients would benefit from such therapies. Several recent clinical trials
failed to show benefits. For example, the mitochondrial inhibitor elesclomol in combination
with paclitaxel did not increase progression-free survival in a phase III melanoma trial
(O’Day et al., 2013). Likewise, retrospective studies of the effects of metformin, at antidiabetic doses, on prostate cancer mortality have delivered contradictory results that

dampened overall enthusiasm (Azvolinsky, 2014). Although the effectiveness of metformin
is more appropriately tested in randomized prospective trials which are now underway, even
those may fail if performed in an unselected patient cohort. Notably, the “flopped”
elesclomol trial actually did reveal a statistically signi cant improvement in median
progression-free survival for the elesclomol/paclitaxel combination in a subgroup of patients
with normal as opposed to increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (O’Day et al.,
2013). High levels of this metabolic enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to
lactate, may stimulate anaerobic glycolysis thereby enabling escape from mitochondrial
inhibition.

Considering the points above, clinical testing of mitochondrial inhibitors stands to win as
much from effective biomarkers as any other form of new therapy. One main significance of
the new studies summarized in this article (Corazao-Rozas et al., 2013; Dörr et al., 2013;
Haq et al., 2013; Roesch et al., 2013; Vazquez et al., 2013) may lie with their opening of a
treasure trove of potential biomarkers for patient stratification in future clinical trials (Table
2). Chief among these would be OXPHOS components, such as complex I – V subunits and
oxidative stress defenders such as hemeoxigenase 1 (HMOX1), SOD and catalase (CAT),
genes, which were repeatedly found upregulated in drug resistant cancers. Upstream
regulators of OXPHOS gene expression such as PCG1α and NRF2 would also seem
promising candidate biomarkers. While nuclear accumulation of NRF2 mediates an adaptive
response to oxidative stress and is thus typically thought of as an indicator of
chemoresistance (Villeneuve et al., 2010), recent evidence implicated the transcription factor
in a threshold-dependent feed-forward loop of ROS generation cumulating in cell death
(Zucker et al., 2014). In addition, prostate cancer cells with constitutively nuclear NRF2 are
exquisitely sensitive to the mitochondrial inhibitor SMIP004 (Rico-Bautista et al., 2013). It
is thus possible that high levels of nuclear NRF2 in advanced cancers correspond with
sensitivity to inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration, although more detailed validation is
required. AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) may also be a surrogate marker for energy stress
in drug-resistant cancer with increased mitochondrial activity (Dörr et al., 2013). More
classical indicators of redox and energy status such as the levels of reduced glutathione,
ROS, and ATP as well as oxygen consumption might also be considered, although these are
less practical to measure, at least in fixed clinical material.
It is anticipated that mitochondrial inhibitors could be used either as second-line treatment of
drug resistant cancers or even as first-line treatment in combination with standard-of-care
cytotoxic or targeted therapies (Fig. 1B). Biomarker-guided clinical trials will be necessary
to rigorously assess these options.

Potential Limitations
Despite these promises, some important unknowns remain that will require further research
to be resolved. For example, it is too early to say how pervasive the switch to oxidative
metabolism in TSQ cells is. Is it limited to the lymphoma and melanoma models discussed
here or is it a general characteristic of quiescent cells as has been proposed (reviewed in
(Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011; Ward and Thompson, 2012)? Once again, molecular
profiling – e.g. for the signatures outlined in Table 2 - of other cancer models and patient

samples may assists in answering this question. The important factor here is not necessarily
the actual fraction of drug-resistant cancers that show the respiration phenotype but rather
the sensitivity and specificity with which biomarkers can identify this fraction.

Author Manuscript

Likewise, the concept emerging from the observations summarized here proposing that
disruption of mitochondrial respiration affords a level of selectivity for cancer cells that is
required for a successful therapeutic approach has not yet been conclusively established.
This uncertainty is especially worrisome for normal cells with a high demand of
mitochondrial ATP such as cardiomyocytes or with limited ability to withstand oxidative
stress (cardiomyocytes, dopaminergic neurons etc.). Further research is required to assess
whether the selective upregulation of mitochondrial respiration observed in drug-resistant
cancers creates enough of a therapeutic window to effectively and safely intervene with
mitochondrial inhibitors. This being said, it should not be forgotten that several
mitochondrial inhibitors have been in safe clinical use for decades. It is also worth noting
that toxicity associated with mitochondrial inhibitors can be off-target effects. For example,
the neurotoxicity of rotenone and MPP+ is not a result of their activity in inhibiting complex
I but rather to their off-target activity of disrupting microtubules (Choi et al., 2011).
Piericidin, another complex I inhibitor that does not disrupt microtubules is not neurotoxic.
This example illustrates that neurotoxicity is not an obligatory adverse effect of
mitochondrial inhibitors.

Author Manuscript

As noted above, a main issue with agents such as metformin and elesclomol in clinic trials
has not been toxicity, but rather lack of efficacy. These failures may indicate either
ineffective selection of patients most likely to benefit from mitochondrial inhibitors based
on biomarkers or rapid development of resistance to this therapeutic approach. It has been
established for decades that eukaryotic cells can be adapted to ρ0 cells, which lack
mitochondrial DNA, demonstrating that respiration activity is not strictly essential for
survival, at least under nutrient rich conditions. In addition, a recent study demonstrated that
increased glycolysis can compensate for inhibition of mitochondrial respiration effected by
downregulating PGC1α in melanoma cells (Lim et al., 2014). The escape was due to ROSmediated stabilization of HIF1α, which in turn upregulated glycolytic genes. Although it
remains to be seen whether pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial respiration would
lead to a similar adaptation, these findings suggest that, as with many other cancer therapies,
the real potential of mitochondrial inhibitors may lie with combining them with inhibitors of
other metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, glutamine utilization, or ROS detoxification.

Figure 1. Models of therapy-induced quiescence leading to upregulation of mitochondrial
respiration and effect of mitochondrial inhibitors

Author Manuscript

(A) Drug treatment leads to apoptotic cell death in the bulk of the tumor mass. A minority of
cells escape into a quiescent/senescent state with upregulated mitochondrial respiration.
When these “cancer memory cells” escape quiescence, they give rise to relapse.
(B) Based on the reports summarized in this article, drug treatment would select for slow
cycling therapy-resistant cancer cells in which transcriptional pathways are upregulated that
induce ETC proteins and mitochondrial respiration. OXPHOS upregulation is expected to
selectively sensitize drug selected cells to mitochondrial inhibitors (depicted in purple),
resulting in ROS formation and downstream events that cumulate in synthetic lethality of the
drug-resistant cancer.
