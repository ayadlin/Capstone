SUMMARY
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mutations in KRAS are prevalent in human cancers and universally predictive of resistance to anticancer therapeutics. Although it is widely accepted that acquisition of an activating mutation
endows RAS genes with functional autonomy, recent studies suggest that the wild-type forms of
Ras may contribute to mutant Ras-driven tumorigenesis. Here we show that downregulation of
wild-type H-Ras or N-Ras in mutant K-Ras cancer cells leads to hyperactivation of the Erk/
p90RSK and PI3K/Akt pathways, and consequently, the phosphorylation of Chk1 at an inhibitory
site, Ser 280. The resulting inhibition of ATR/Chk1 signaling abrogates the activation of the G2
DNA damage checkpoint and confers specific sensitization of mutant K-Ras cancer cells to DNA
damage chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In mammals three closely related RAS oncogenes, HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS, have been
identified. These genes encode small GTPases that function as molecular switches
governing the activation of a vast network of signaling pathways. Growth factor signaling
activates Ras by recruiting guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that catalyze the
exchange of GDP for GTP (Bos et al., 2007). In turn, Ras activity is terminated through
GTP hydrolysis which is greatly enhanced by GTPase accelerating proteins (GAPs).
Hyperactivation of Ras, which largely occurs through the acquisition of mutations that
hinder GTP hydrolysis, has been implicated in the etiology of a wide number of human
cancers. Overall, mutations in the RAS genes have been associated with ~30% of all human

tumors. Such mutations are generally limited to one of the RAS genes, with KRAS being the
most frequently mutated and with the highest incidence in adenocarcinomas of the pancreas
(57%), colon (33%), and lung (17%) (Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2011).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The critical role of oncogenic K-Ras as a driving mutation in the pathogenesis of cancer is
supported by several genetically engineered mouse models. Accordingly, expression of
mutant K-Ras alone is sufficient to drive malignant progression, whereas its elimination
from established tumors leads to tumor regression (Chin et al., 1999; Fisher et al., 2001;
Haigis et al., 2008; Jackson et al., 2001; Li et al., 2011; Ying et al., 2012). Because of its
capacity to constitutively engage downstream effector pathways, oncogenic K-Ras was
initially thought to drive the tumorigenic process independently of the wild-type forms.
However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the biological outputs of oncogenic K-Ras
are subject to a complex and context-dependent modulation by wild-type Ras proteins.
Studies in chemically-induced models of lung or skin tumorigenesis have demonstrated that
the acquisition of an activating mutation in a KRas or HRas allele is associated with allelic
loss of the KRas wild-type or HRas wild-type allele, respectively (Bremner and Balmain,
1990; Hegi et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 2001). Zhang et al. further demonstrated that loss of
the wild-type KRas allele enhanced mutant K-Ras driven tumorigenesis (Zhang et al., 2001).
Together these results suggest a tumor suppressive effect of the wild-type Ras allele.
Conversely, a recent study reported that in mutant K-Ras-driven colorectal cancer, wild-type
K-Ras plays a tumor promoting role through counteracting mutant K-Ras-induced apoptosis
by mediating signaling from mutant K-Ras-dependent autocrine-activated EGFR
(Matallanas et al., 2011).
Mutant K-Ras-driven cancers also retain the wild-type products of the remaining RAS genes,
H- and NRAS, which appear to synergize with mutant K-Ras in tumors of various tissues.
For example, enhanced levels of GTP-bound H-Ras and N-Ras, due to mutant K-Ras
dependent nitrosylation of wild-type H- and N-Ras, were shown to be required for the
proliferation of mutant K-Ras cancer cells (Lim et al., 2008). A role for wild-type H-Ras and
N-Ras proteins in mediating RTK signaling and proliferation of cancer cells that harbor
mutant K-Ras has also been demonstrated (Young et al., 2012). Moreover, SON OF
SEVENLESS (SOS), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ras and Rho GTPases
has been implicated in mutant Ras-driven tumorigenesis (Jeng et al., 2012).

In the current study we sought to determine the mechanisms by which wild-type H-Ras and
N-Ras proteins promote the mutant K-Ras-driven tumorigenic phenotype.

RESULTS
Mutant K-Ras cancer cells require wild-type H-Ras for proliferation and progression
through mitosis
To investigate the functional relationship between mutant K-Ras and wild-type (WT) H/NRas, we took the approach of specifically suppressing the expression of WT-H-Ras and/or
WT-N-Ras, in cancer cells positive or negative for mutant K-Ras. To this end, we initially
employed the isogenic colon cancer cells DLD-1 K-RasWT/G12D (DLD1 K-RasMut) and
DLD1 K-RasWT/- (DLD1 K-RasKO) where the K-RASG12D allele has been knocked out by

homologous recombination (Luo et al., 2009a; Shirasawa et al., 1993). These cell lines were
engineered to harbor doxycycline (Dox)-inducible shRNAs directed at H-Ras, N-Ras, or
both H- and N-Ras. Accordingly, doxycycline treatment specifically suppressed expression
and activity of the targeted isoforms, with no effect on the remaining isoforms (Figure
1A-1B and Figure S1A). As shown in Figure 1C individual knockdown of WT-H-Ras or
WT-N-Ras in DLD1 K-RasMut cells led to slower growth. Of note, no synergy was observed
upon knockdown of both WT-H-Ras and WT-N-Ras suggesting that the two WT-isoforms
converge on the same signaling module that regulates growth of DLD1 K-RasMut cells
(Figure 1C). In contrast, knockdown of either WT-H-Ras or WT-N-Ras, or the two
combined, in DLD1 K-RasKO cells, had no effect on cell growth indicating that the
dependence on WT-H- and/or N-Ras for cell growth is a unique property of mutant K-Ras
cancer cells (Figure 1D and Figure S1A).

We next investigated whether the attenuated cell growth observed upon WT-H-Ras and/or
N-Ras knockdown in DLD1 K-RasMut cells could be the result of a slower progression
through the cell cycle. Initially, we examined the cell cycle progression of WT-H-Rassuppressed DLD1 K-RasMut cells that were synchronized at the G1/S border by double
thymidine treatment. Six hours after release, both WT-H-Ras-suppressed (+Dox) and WTH-Ras-intact (-Dox) DLD1 K-RasMut cells had completed replication and were
predominantly in G2 as determined by the accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content
(Figure 1E-1F and Figure S1B). However, whereas the majority of WT-H-Ras-intact cells
completed mitosis and cell division and reached G1 over the next 4 hours, WT-H-Rassuppressed cells showed a delayed transition through G2/M, as evident by the persistence of
cells with 4N DNA content (Figure 1E, arrows). FACS analysis of phospho-histone H3
positive cells revealed an increased mitotic index of WT-H-Ras-suppressed cells relative to
control (7 hr - 11 hr), suggesting that the elevated fraction of 4N DNA content cells
associated with WT-H-Ras knockdown was due to a mitotic delay (Figure 1E-1F).
Consistent with this interpretation, WT-H-Ras-suppressed DLD1 K-RasMut cells showed
mitotic defects that would preclude the timely satifaction of the spindle checkpoint including
misaligned and damaged chromosomes (Figure 1G). To quantitatively measure the mitotic
delay within individual cells and rule out the possibility that the observed mitotic aberrations
were due to the synchronization technique, we analyzed the duration of mitosis in
asynchronous cells by time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy. We observed that WT-H-Ras
knockdown delayed mitotic progression in DLD1 K-RasMut cells (duration of mitosis was
~2 times longer compared to control) but not in DLD1 K-RasKO cells (Figure 1H and Figure
S1C-S1D). Similar results were obtained when this analysis was extended to the pancreatic
cell line pair Panc-1 (K-Ras mutant) and BxPC-3 (K-Ras WT) (Figure 1H, Movie S1, Movie
S2, and Figure S1C-S1D). Taken together these data indicate that K-Ras mutant cells
specifically require WT-H-Ras for the timely progression of mitosis.
Wild-type H/N-Ras knockdown enhance DNA damage in mutant K-Ras cancer cells
In principle, the delay in mitosis and damaged chromosomes, induced by WT-H-Ras
knockdown, can be explained by misregulation of the DNA damage response (DDR)
(Rieder and Maiato, 2004; Brown and Baltimore, 2000; Lam et al., 2004; Loffler et al.,
2006; Zachos and Gillespie, 2007). A defective DDR would compromise the ability of the

cell to repair DNA damage thereby leading to an enhancement in the levels of DNA strand
breaks (Syljuasen et al., 2005; Toledo et al., 2011b). Evaluation of DNA strand breaks by
monitoring γH2AX staining revealed a significant accumulation of γH2AX-positive cells
upon knockdown of WT-H-Ras in the DLD1-K-RasMut cells and a panel of K-Ras mutant
(Mut) pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1, AsPC-1, PL45, MIA PaCa-2) (Figure 2A-2C). In
contrast, γH2AX levels remain unaltered when WT-H-Ras was knocked down in the DLD1K-RasKO and K-Ras WT pancreatic cancer cell lines (BxPC-3 and Hs-700T), consistent
with K-Ras Mut cancer cells being uniquely dependent on WT-H-Ras for modulating DNA
damage and cell cycle progression (Figure 2A-2C). A similar dependency was observed
upon knockdown of WT-N-Ras, and no synergistic effect was observed when both WT-HRas and WT-N-Ras were knocked down (Figure S2A-S2C). The elevated γH2AX levels
were not due to an accumulation of cells in S-phase because there was no significant
difference in the S-phase profiles between control and WT-H-Ras, WT-N-Ras, or WT-Hand N-Ras-suppressed cells (Figure 2A and Figure S2B). Of note, we have observed no
correlation between enhanced γH2AX levels due to WT-H- and/or N-Ras knockdown and
the proliferative rate or basal γH2AX levels of the cancer cells analyzed (Figure S1D and
data not shown). This suggests that the elevated DNA damage induced by WT-H- and/or NRas knockdown is not due to a faster proliferation rate or higher basal DNA damage of KRas mutant cells, but instead is a consequence of a perturbed DDR. Moreover, knockdown
of WT-H-Ras in melanoma cells that harbor an activating N-Ras mutation (NRas Q61L)
also enhanced γH2AX levels, indicating that WT-Ras could be required for the regulation of
the basal levels of DNA damage in cancer cells with activating mutations in any of the Ras
isoforms (Figure S2E).
Dependence of mutant K-Ras cancer cells on wild-type H/N-Ras for the activation of the G2
DNA damage checkpoint

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To directly evaluate whether WT-H-Ras knockdown impacted the activation of the DNA
damage checkpoint, we subjected K-Ras Mut cells to UV-C irradiation and monitored
mitotic entry at 1, 2, and 3 hr intervals after UV-C induced damage. Panc-1 and DLD1-KRasMut cells expressing scramble shRNA displayed a block in mitotic entry in response to
UV-C-induced DNA damage indicating a functional G2 DNA damage checkpoint (Figure
3A-3B and Figure S3A). In contrast, progression into mitosis following UV-C treatment was
unperturbed in Panc-1 and DLD1-K-RasMut cells depleted of WT-H-Ras, indicating a
defective G2 DNA damage checkpoint (Figure 3A-3B). This defect was not specific to UVC-induced damage as Panc-1 (Figure 3C) and DLD1-K-RasMut cells (Figure S3B) depleted
of WT-H-Ras failed to initiate and maintain cell cycle arrest in response to the
topoisomerase I inhibitor SN38. A similar defect was observed in Panc-1 cells depleted of
WT-N-Ras (Figure S3C).
A predictable outcome of a defective G2 DNA damage checkpoint is entry into mitosis with
unresolved DNA breaks following damage (Jiang et al., 2009). In agreement with this
prediction, a significant fraction of WT-H- and/or N-Ras depleted Panc-1 and DLD1-KRasMut cancer cells that entered mitosis following UV-C exposure, also stained positive for
γH2AX (Figure 3D-3E and Figure S3D). Notably, no such differences were observed in KRas WT cancer cell lines (Figure 3E and Figure S3D). These data demonstrate that WT-H-

and/or N-Ras are critical for the establishment of a functional G2 DNA damage checkpoint

Wild-type H/N-Ras knockdown impairs Chk1 activation in K-Ras mutant cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To gain insight into the molecular basis for the perturbation of the G2 DNA damage
checkpoint by WT-H/N-Ras knockdown, we examined the DNA-damage specific activation
of ATR/Chk1 and ATM/Chk2 in response to SN38 or UV-C treatment (Bartek and Lukas,
2003; Zhou and Elledge, 2000). Notably, WT-H-Ras knockdown was accompanied by a
defective Chk1 activation in response to either SN38 or UV-C treatment in K-Ras Mut cell
lines Panc-1 and DLD1-K-RasMut (Figure 3F and Figure S3E-S3F), and MIA PaCa-2
(Figure S4A) as evidenced by impaired phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser 317 and Ser 345.
The requirement for WT H-Ras for ATR/Chk1 activation was a specific property of K-Ras
mutant cells as WT-H-Ras knockdown had no effect on Chk1 activation in the K-Ras WT
cell lines BxPC-3 and DLD1-K-RasKO (Figure 3F and Figure S3E-S3F). The defect in Chk1
activation upon WT H-Ras knockdown in K-Ras mutant cells was also reflected in the
impaired inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 at Tyr 15 (Figure 3F and Figure S3E). By
comparison, Chk2 activation, as monitored by phosphorylation of Chk2 at threonine 68
(Thr68), was not affected by WT-H-Ras knockdown in either K-Ras Mut (Panc-1) or K-Ras
WT (BxPC-3) cancer cell lines (Figure 3F and Figure S3E); Of note, Chk2 protein levels in
DLD1 cells were too low to reliably measure its activation status. WT-N-Ras knockdown
also led to a selective and similar impairment of ATR/Chk1 activation in K-Ras mutant cells
(Figure 4). Taken together, these results indicate that the defective G2 DNA damage
checkpoint caused by WT-H/N-Ras knockdown in K-Ras mutant cells is due to the failure to
properly activate Chk1.
Wild-type H/N-Ras negatively regulate MAPK and Akt signaling to control Chk1
phosphorylation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The Ras effector signaling pathways, Raf/Erk and PI3K/Akt, have been shown to play a key
role in Chk1 activation and the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. PI3K/Akt was reported to
override DNA-damage-induced G2 arrest through repression of Chk1 activation via Aktmediated inhibitory phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser 280 (King et al., 2004; Puc and Parsons,
2005; Shtivelman et al., 2002). More recently, the Raf/MAPK pathway has been shown to
impair Chk1 activity through Chk1 Ser 280 phosphorylation by MAPK-activated protein
kinase RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) (Li et al., 2012; Ray-David et al., 2012). As wildtype Ras proteins have been reported to antagonize Ras effector signaling output in cancer
cells that harbor mutant Ras (Young et al., 2012), we next investigated whether impaired
Chk1 activation upon WT-H- or N-Ras knockdown was due to enhanced activation of Ras
effector pathways. Knockdown of WT-H- or N-Ras in mutant K-Ras cancer cells was
associated with elevated Erk/p90RSK and Akt activation, which correlated with enhanced
inhibitory phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser 280 both in the basal state and following SN38induced DNA damage (Figure 4A-4B). Conversely, suppression of Erk or Akt signaling via
treatment with MAPK or Akt inhibitors overturned the hyperphosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser
280 in WT-H- or N-Ras-depleted mutant K-Ras cancer cells. Importantly, under these
conditions, the activation of Chk1 in response to SN38-induced DNA damage was restored
as shown by Chk1 Ser 317 phosphorylation (Figure 4C). Altogether these results support a

model whereby in K-Ras mutant cells, the downregulation WT-H/N-Ras leads to the
enhancement of Erk/p90RSK and Akt signaling, which in turn represses Chk1 activation
through Chk1 Ser 280 phosphorylation.
To rule out the possibility that WT-H/N-Ras may also specifically prevent Chk1 Ser 280
phosphorylation, we generated an isogenic derivative of the DLD1-K-RasMut cell line that
can inducibly express GFP-H-RasG12V upon doxycycline administration (DLD1-K-RasMut
Flip-IN TREX GFP-H-RasV12) (Girdler et al., 2006). As illustrated in Figure 4D,
expression of GFP-H-RasG12V at sub-endogenous levels led to a concomitant increase in
Erk and AKT signaling despite the presence of WT-H/N-Ras in these cells. Moreover, this
was accompanied by the phosphorylation of Chk1 at the inhibitory site Ser 280, and an
impairment of Chk1 phosphorylation at the activation sites Ser 317 and Ser 345 (Figure 4D).
Altogether, our data are consistent with a model in which the enhanced phosphorylation of
Chk1 at Ser 280 and inhibition of Chk1 activity observed under conditions of WT-H-Ras
deficiency in mutant K-Ras cells is a consequence of an increase in Erk/Akt signaling.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

If the activation of Chk1 is directly linked to the presence of mutant K-Ras, then the acute
expression of mutant K-Ras in an otherwise K-Ras wild-type cancer cell line should render
Chk1 activation in these cells dependent on WT-H/N-Ras. To test this idea, we silenced
WT-H-Ras in BxPC-3 cells (K-Ras WT) that had been engineered to inducibly express KRasG12V (BxPC-3 K-RasV12) (Figure S4C). Whereas, knockdown of WT-H-Ras in the
parental BxPC-3 cell line had no effect on Chk1 Ser280 phosphorylation and Chk1
activation (Figure S4B and Figure 3F), knockdown of WT-H-Ras in BxPC-3 cells induced
to express K-RasG12V led to elevated Erk activation, induction of Chk1 Ser 280
phosphorylation and impairment of Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser 317 (Figure S4D). These
results suggest that the hyperactivation of Erk/Akt pathways, the enhancement of Chk1 Ser
280 phosphorylation and the impairment of Chk1 activation induced by WT-H-Ras
knockdown represent a set of responses that are specifically dictated by the mutational status
of K-Ras.
Mutant K-Ras cancer cells depleted of wild-type H/N-Ras are highly sensitive to DNA
damage-inducing agents

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The underlying premise for the therapeutic use of DNA damaging agents is that
susceptibility of cancer cells is linked to the lack of G1/S and G2 checkpoints (Ma et al.,
2011; Zhou and Bartek, 2004). Therefore, we reasoned that the abrogation of the ATR/
Chk1-induced DNA damage checkpoint in K-Ras mutant cells by WT-H- and/or N-Ras
knockdown could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of DNA damaging agents. Assessment of
cell viability following treatment with SN38 indicated that the K-Ras mutant cells DLD1 KRasMut and Panc-1 expressing shRNAs targeting H-Ras, were on average ~90-fold and ~50fold more sensitive to SN38 respectively, as compared to DLD1 K-RasMut and Panc-1 cells
expressing scramble shRNA (Figure 5A). Similarly, WT-H-Ras knockdown sensitized these
cells (~13-fold for DLD1 K-RasMut and ~25 fold for Panc-1) to the DNA intrastrand
crosslinker oxaliplatin (Figure 5B). Notably, knockdown of WT-H-Ras or N-Ras in K-Ras
WT cancer cells did not lead to a sensitization to SN38 or oxaliplatin treatment (Figure
5A-5B). Analysis of the apoptotic index, as measured by FACS detection of cleaved caspase

3-positive cells, demonstrates an exacerbation of cell death by WT-H-Ras knockdown in
response to SN38 treatment (Figure 5C-5D). Knockdown of WT-N-Ras also sensitized these
cells to SN38 and oxaliplatin (Figure S5). Together, these results show that WT-H-Ras or NRas knockdown specifically sensitizes K-Ras Mut cancer cells to DNA damaging agents. A
similar sensitization pattern was observed upon the treatment of cells with the Chk1/Chk2
inhibitor AZD7726 (Figure 6A-6B and Figure S6), supporting the hypothesis that WT-H/NRas downregulation selectively sensitizes K-Ras mutant cells to DNA damage-inducing
agents by abrogating Chk1 activity.
Knockdown of wild-type H-Ras sensitizes K-Ras mutant tumors to DNA damage-inducing
chemotherapy and leads to tumor regression

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test the in vivo effects of WT-H-Ras knockdown on the sensitivity of K-Ras mutant
tumors to DNA damaging agents, we established xenografts of DLD1-K-Ras mutant cells
that inducibly express WT-H-Ras shRNA upon exposure to doxycycline in athymic nu/nu
mice. Administration of doxycycline or vehicle was initiated after tumors had reached
~100mm3. Seven days post-induction (tumor size ~ 250 mm3), efficient knockdown of WTH-Ras was confirmed in the established tumors and treatment with irinotecan (CPT), a
topoisomerase I inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer, was
initiated (Figure S7A). In the absence of treatment with irinotecan, tumors arising from the
WT-H-Ras-suppressed cells grew similarly to those arising from uninduced control cells
(Figure 7A-7B). Thus, distinct from our in vitro studies, WT-H-Ras knockdown in vivo was
not associated with any delay in growth or mitotic progression under these conditions
(Figure 7A and Figure 7D-7E). However, similar to our observations in the synchronization
studies, we did note an elevation in aberrant mitotic figures (chromosome misalignment and
lagging chromosomes), which is an indication of perturbed mitosis (Figure 1G and data not
shown). Hence, the lack of a higher mitotic index despite aberrant mitosis, may reflect
clearance of the aberrant mitotic cells in the in vivo setting. In agreement with previously
reported studies, treatment with irinotecan alone resulted in a reduction of tumor growth
(Figure 7A-7B) (Harris et al., 2005; Zabludoff et al., 2008). Notably, five days following the
termination of irinotecan administration, WT-H-Ras-suppressed tumors had undergone
regression, which was maintained for the duration of the study, up to 18 days post treatment
(Figure 7A-7B). In contrast, the control irinotecan-treated tumors showed in large part a
modest growth over the same time period (Figure S7B). Consistent with our cell-based
studies, abrogation of WT-H-Ras in mutant K-Ras tumors led to Erk and Akt
hyperactivation and the inhibition of Chk1 activation, as reflected by an elevated Chk1 Ser
280 phosphorylation and an impaired Chk1 Ser 317 phosphorylation in both mock and
irinotecan-treated tumors (Figure 7C). Assessment of the extent of apoptosis revealed that
the combination of WT-H-Ras knockdown and irinotecan treatment induced a significant
increase in tumor cell apoptosis compared to WT-H-Ras knockdown or irinotecan treatment
alone (Figure 7D-7E). Importantly, irinotecan treatment failed to induce cell cycle arrest of
WT-H-Ras-suppressed tumors as evident by the significant increase in the number of cells
staining positive for phosphorylated histone H3 compared to WT-H-Ras-intact tumors
(Figure 7D-7E). These results indicate that WT-H-Ras knockdown in K-Ras mutant cells
compromises the DNA damage checkpoint-mediated cell cycle arrest in vivo.

To further substantiate the in vivo analyses of the consequences of WT-H-Ras knockdown,
we administered irinotecan or vehicle to xenograft tumors derived from either MIA PaCa-2
(K-Ras Mutant) or BxPC-3 (K-Ras WT) cells that were engineered to inducibly (+Dox)
express WT-H-Ras shRNA (Figure S7C-S7D). Similar to DLD1-K-RasMut xenografts,
combination of WT-H-Ras knockdown and irinotecan treatment led to MIA PaCa-2 tumor
regression, whereas irinotecan alone led to a growth delay and WT-H-Ras knockdown alone
had no effect (Figure S7C). Importantly, we found no synergy between WT-H-Ras
knockdown and irinotecan treatment in BxPC-3 xenograft tumors (Figure S7D).
Collectively, these observations establish a role for WT-H-Ras in maintaining a functional
Chk1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint in established K-Ras mutant tumors.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Effective targeting of oncogenic K-Ras-driven tumors has remained a major challenge in
cancer therapy. Considerable evidence indicates that cancer cells develop dependencies on
normal functions of certain genes that can potentially be exploited to improve therapeutic
strategies (De Raedt et al., 2011; Kumar et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2009a; Luo et al., 2009b). In
the present study we demonstrate that K-Ras mutant cancers display a dependency on WTH/N-Ras for the activation of the ATR/Chk1 mediated DNA damage response (DDR) and
therefore can be sensitized to DNA damaging chemotherapeutics through the suppression of
WT-H/N-Ras. The activation of DDR has been shown to play distinct context-dependent
roles in the course of malignant transformation (Toledo et al., 2011a). In premalignant
lesions DDR activation is triggered by oncogenic stress and commonly leads to cell death or
senescence thereby functioning as an intrinsic barrier to malignancy (Bartkova et al., 2005;
Gilad et al., 2010; Schoppy et al., 2012). Full malignant transformation, however, is
accompanied by a weakening of the DDR barrier through the selective acquisition of
mutations within critical DDR signaling modules (for example p53 mutations and
abrogation of ATM/Chk2/p53 signaling). As such, advanced tumors become highly reliant
on the remaining functional DDR pathway (ATR/Chk1) for coping with the high levels of
oncogene-induced genotoxic stress. In this context, the role of WT-H/N-Ras in coordinating
the activation of ATR/Chk1 is critical for supporting the tumorigenic phenotype of K-Ras
mutant tumors by preventing catastrophic DNA damage and enhancing tumorigenic fitness
and survival. Consistent with this model, wild-type Ras has been shown to play a tumorpromoting role in cell lines from established tumors (Young et al., 2012).
Our results identify a role for WT-H/N-Ras in facilitating Chk1 activation by suppressing
the Erk/p90RSK and PI3K/Akt pathways that inhibit Chk1 via Ser 280 phosphorylation. The
capacity of WT-Ras to negatively regulate effector pathway signaling in mutant Ras cancer
cells is consistent with earlier reports showing that the levels of WT-Ras proteins in mutant
Ras cancer cell lines are inversely correlated to the activation status of Ras-effector
molecules (Young et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2001). It is noteworthy that the knockdown of
either wild-type isoform alone is sufficient to hyperactivate Erk and Akt and inhibit Chk1
activity and checkpoint function. This suggests a tightly controlled threshold for the WTH/N-Ras-mediated attenuation of Ras-effector signaling in mutant K-Ras cancers. The
mechanisms underlying the WT-H/N-Ras-mediated antagonism of Ras effector signaling in
mutant K-Ras cancers remain to be delineated. Of potential relevance to this question are the

seemingly contradictory observations that while the knockdown of WT-H/N-Ras in mutant
K-Ras cancer cells induces Erk and Akt hyperactivation, the knockdown of Sos1, a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor for Ras GTPases, instead impairs Erk and Akt activity (Jeng et
al., 2012). A fundamental difference between these two scenarios is that whereas Sos
knockdown would affect the levels of GTP-bound Ras, the knockdown of WT-H/N-Ras
would inevitably lessen both GDP and GTP-bound Ras levels. Since the WT-isoforms exist
predominantly in the GDP-bound form, knockdown of WT-H/N-Ras is likely to
significantly alter the stoichiometry of GDP- to GTP-Ras molecules. This may provide a
plausible explanation for the observed hyperactivation of Erk and Akt, as GDP-bound Ras
molecules have been suggested to play an inhibitory role in Ras signaling (Singh et al.,
2005). Furthermore, in the case of Raf, activation depends on Ras-mediated homo- and/or
heterodimerization of Raf proteins, which likely require at least two Ras-GTP molecules
(Heidorn et al., 2010; Inouye et al., 2000; Poulikakos et al., 2011; Rushworth et al., 2006;
Weber et al., 2001). Since Ras dimerization appears to be constitutive and non-selective for
GDP or GTP-bound Ras, depletion of GDP-bound Ras, as in the case of knockdown of WTH-Ras or N-Ras, would stoichiometrically favor Ras-GTP dimer formation and
consequently lead to Raf hyperactivation (Heidorn et al., 2010; Inouye et al., 2000).

There is now a large body of pre-clinical evidence showing that inhibition of the ATR/Chk1
pathway enhances the efficacy of standard chemotherapy. Indeed, several Chk1 inhibitors
are being tested in clinical trials (Ma, 2012). As such, the ability of WT-H/N-Ras to
determine Chk1 activation in mutant K-Ras tumors may warrant further exploration into the
development of a therapeutic approach that utilizes inhibition of wild-type Ras-ATR/Chk1
signaling in combination with DNA damaging agents for the selective targeting of K-Ras
driven cancers.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell culture and lentiviral transduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Human pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1, PL45, AsPC-1, CFPAC-1, MIA PaCa-2,
BxPC-3, and Hs700T were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The isogenic
colon cancer cells DLD1-K-RasMut and DLD1-K-RasKO were a kind gift from Dr. Mark
Philips. Lentiviral particles were generated according to standard protocols. For knockdown
experiments cells were transduced with lentiviral particles (multiplicity of infections (MOI)
for Hs700T, 15; all other cell lines, 7) containing pTripz scramble shRNA, H-Ras shRNA,
or N-Ras shRNA, and selected with puromycin (Calbiochem; for AsPC-1, 4 μg/ml; for all
others, 2 μg/ml) for 3 days. Unless otherwise indicated all experiments were performed on
day 4 of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) induction. DLD1 K-RasMut Flip-IN TREX GFP-H-RasV12
cells were generated through Flp recombinase mediated homologous recombination between
the FRT sites in the DLD1 K-RasMut cell line and the pcDNA3/FRT/TO/GFP-HRasG12V
expression vector. To generate BxPC-3-K-RasV12 cells, BxPC-3 cells were transduced with
a TET inducible lentiviral vector to express K-RasG12V, pLenti-TO-K-RasG12V (MOI=1).
Following puromycin selection, cells that had efficiently integrated the K-RasG12V
lentiviral construct (BxPC-3-K-RasV12) were expanded and subsequently transduced with a
pTRIPZ-H-Ras sh construct. As both vectors are Dox inducible, induction of the expression

of K-RasV12 also induces the knockdown of WT-H-Ras. Following a 48 hr induction,
BxPC-3-K-RasV12 cells that also expressed the H-Ras sh were obtained by fluorescent
sorting (RFP: pTRIPZ-H-Ras sh also expresses RFP upon Dox induction). The obtained
cells were then cultured for an additional 48h in the presence of Dox and assayed for Chk1
activation upon treatment with SN38.
Cell viability assays
For viability assays, cells were treated with doxycycline to induce shRNA expression for 4
days and then seeded at a density of 4000 cells/well in a 96-well plate in doxycycline
containing media. 24 hours post plating, either SN-38 (Tocris Biosciences), or oxaliplatin
(Tocris Biosciences), or vehicle was added. Following a 72h treatment, cell viability was
assessed by the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide;
Sigma-Aldrich) assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Viable fraction is expressed
as the percentage of vehicle treated control cells. EC50 was calculated using Graphpad
Prism v4.0 software.
Cell synchronization and flow cytometry

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were synchronized at the G1/S transition by a double thymidine block. Cells were
treated with 2 mM thymidine for 22 hours, and released from thymidine block by washing
twice with PBS followed by incubation in fresh medium. 14 hours after release, thymidine
was added for another 20 hours. Induction of H-Ras shRNA expression was initiated with
the first thymidine block. For the G2/M checkpoint analysis in response to UV-C, cells were
irradiated with UV-C (25 J/m2) during the exponential growth phase. Cells were harvested 1
hr, 2 hr, and 3 hr later, fixed with ice-cold 80% ethanol/PBS, and incubated overnight at
−20°C. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100/PBS
on ice for 10 min. Cells were stained with anti-phospho histone H3 to detect mitotic cells
and TO-PRO 3 for DNA content. For G2/M checkpoint activation in response to SN-38,
cells were treated with 4 nM SN-38 and fixed at the indicated time points. Staining for
cleaved caspase 3 positive cells was performed using the Nucview-488 Caspase 3 Kit
(Biotium). Flow cytometry was performed on an LSRII (BD Biosciences) at NYU School of
Medicine Flow Cytometry Core Facility, and data were analyzed using FlowJo software.

Animal Studies
For xenograft studies we subcutaneously implanted 2 × 106 DLD1 K-RasMut, MIA PaCa-2,
or BxPC-3 cells stable for pTripz-H-Ras shRNA (1:1 in Matrigel, BD Biosciences) in both
flanks of 8-week-old female athymic nude (NCRNU, Taconic) mice. When tumor size
reached ~100 mm3 mice were given drinking water containing either doxycycline (0.2 mg/
ml) / 0.5% sucrose or 0.5% sucrose alone. Water was replaced every 3 days. Tumor volume
was determined using electronic calipers to measure length (l), width (w), and the formula
(w2 × l)/2. Tumor volume was measured twice a week. We treated mice bearing H-Ras
depleted (dox/sucrose) or H-Ras intact (sucrose) DLD1 K-RasMut tumors with either
irinotecan or vehicle, once tumors reached 250 mm3. Irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT)
powder was dissolved into solution as previously described (Harris et al., 2005; Zabludoff et
al., 2008). This solution was diluted with 5% dextrose for intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at a
dose of 50 mg/kg every other day for 3 rounds of treatment (q2dx3). Irinotecan, or the

combinatorial H-Ras knockdown and irinotecan treatments, were well tolerated as no weight
loss above 10% body mass was observed. Body mass was measured using an electronic
scale every 2 days. The percent change in tumor volume from day 0 of irinotecan treatment
to tumor volume five days after the last dose of irinotecan administration was measured.
Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide-induced narcosis. To prepare lysates tumor tissue
was homogenized in RIPA buffer and sonicated to shear genomic DNA. All animal work
was approved by New York University Langone Medical Center Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed by the Graphpad Prism built-in test (unpaired, two-tailed), and results
were considered significant at P<0.05.

SIGNIFICANCE

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

This study defines a functional dependence of K-Ras driven tumors on wild-type H- and
N-Ras for the DNA damage response and reveals a promising therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of mutant K-Ras tumors. We demonstrate that mutant K-Ras cancer cells
require wild-type H-Ras and N-Ras for the activation of the ATR-Chk1 mediated DNA
damage checkpoint, and that this dependence can be exploited to specifically sensitize KRas-driven cancers to DNA damage-inducing agents.

in the presence or absence of the MAPK inhibitor (U0126, 10 μM) or the PI3K inhibitor
(LY294002, 5 μM). WCLs were analyzed to determine ERK/p90RSK or Akt inhibition and
their respective effect on Chk1 phosphorylation and activation status.
(D) Isogenic derivatives of DLD1 K-RasMut cells engineered to inducibly express GFP-HRasG12V (DLD1 K-RasMut Flp-IN TREX GFP-H-RasV12) upon addition of doxycycline
were induced for 0, 2, 4 hr and subjected to SN38 (8 nM) for 2 hr (for the 2 hr Dox
induction, Dox and SN38 were added simultaneously; for the 4 hr Dox induction, SN38 was
added 2 hr post induction and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 hr).
Representative immunoblots for the indicated proteins are shown. Arrowhead indicates
GFP-H-RasG12V and * indicates endogenous H-Ras. See also Figure S4.
