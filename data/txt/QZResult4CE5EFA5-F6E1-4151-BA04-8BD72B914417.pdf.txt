Abstract
We present a light scattering study using angle-resolved low
coherence interferometry (a/LCI) to assess nuclear morphology and subcellular structure within MCF-7 cells at several
time points after treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.
Although the nuclear diameter and eccentricity are not
observed to change, the light scattering signal reveals a
change in the organization of subcellular structures that we
interpret using fractal dimension (FD). The FD of subcellular
structures in cells treated with paclitaxel and doxorubicin is
observed to increase significantly compared with that of
control cells as early as 1.5 and 3 hours after application,
respectively. The FD is then found to decrease slightly at 6
hours postapplication for both agents only to increase again
from 12 to 24 hours posttreatment when the observations
ceased. The changes in structure appear over two time scales,
suggesting that multiple mechanisms are evident in these
early apoptotic stages. Indeed, quantitative image analysis of
fluorescence micrographs of cells undergoing apoptosis
verifies that the FD of 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole–stained
nuclear structures does not change significantly in cells until
12 hours after treatment, whereas that of MitoTracker stained
mitochondria is seen to modulate as early as 3 hours after
treatment. In contrast, cells receiving an increased dose of
paclitaxel that induced G2-M arrest, but not apoptosis, only
exhibited the early change in subcellular structure but did not
show the later change associated with changes in nuclear
substructure. These results suggest that a/LCI may have utility
in detecting early apoptotic events for both clinical and basic
science applications. [Cancer Res 2009;69(3):1199–204]

Introduction
Dysregulation of programmed cell death, apoptosis, has
important implications in normal development and disease. A
key step in cancer initiation and progression is escape from normal
apoptotic controls that lead to the elimination of cancer cells (1).
In addition, defective apoptotic signaling results in cancer cells that
may be resistant to, or become resistant to, chemotherapeutic
treatments. Extensive research has been done and is currently
under way to understand apoptotic signaling pathways and how
these pathways are perturbed in cancer and other diseases (2).

Additional efforts are being put forth to develop technologies to
detect apoptosis in vivo (3). Noninvasive in vivo detection of
apoptosis has great potential to enhance our ability to monitor
patients undergoing cancer therapy and could provide rapid
feedback on whether a patient is responding to current
conventional therapies or newly developed drugs. Currently, many
noninvasive imaging techniques require radioactive labels and
contrast agents (3). We aim to develop an optical technology that
uses endogenous contrast to detect early structural changes
characteristic of apoptosis.
Two distinct modes of apoptosis have been described, extrinsic
and intrinsic. Extrinsic activation of apoptosis is dependent on
activation of death receptors (i.e., TNFR family), whereas intrinsic
apoptosis activation results from disruption of intracellular
homeostasis (DNA damage, cellular stress). Taxanes and anthracylines, such as paclitaxel and doxorubicin, respectively, are used to
treat a variety of types of cancer and lead to the activation of
intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Paclitaxel enhances microtubule
stability, resulting in G2-M arrest and apoptosis. Doxorubicin is a
topoisomerase II inhibitor and inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis.
Although these two chemotherapy agents have different mechanisms of action, both have been shown to induce apoptosis in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells (4, 5). We aim to determine if similar
changes in subcellular structure after drug treatment can be
detected using light scattering methods.
Intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis both result in a highly ordered
apoptotic process that is characterized by specific morphologic
and biochemical changes. Morphologic changes include chromatin
condensation, cell shrinkage, and membrane blebbing (2). Common biochemical events include translocation of phosphotidylserine to the outer plasma membrane, caspase activation, and DNA
fragmentation (2). These common morphologic and biochemical
characteristics have directed the study of molecular events
associated with apoptosis and resistance to apoptotic stimuli. For
example, there are numerous assays available to identify DNA
fragmentation, an end result of apoptosis. These include flow
cytometry approaches in which DNA from fixed cells is labeled
with an exogenous dye, such as propidium iodide, 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI), or Hoescht, and then cellular DNA content is
examined on a cell by cell basis (6). Additionally, there are assays
for caspase activation, which involve incubating live cells or a
cellular lysate with a caspase cleavage site conjugated to an
exogenous fluorophore (chromophore) that fluoresces (absorbs)
once cleaved (7). Assays that differentiate early and late apoptotic
events use Annexin V fluorescent conjugates, which bind to the
exposed phosphotidylserine, in combination with dyes (i.e., propiduim iodide, 7-AAD) that only enter cells after loss of membrane
integrity (6). Although more recent data indicates that additional
subcellular structural and functional changes commonly occur
during early apoptosis (8–10), techniques that provide early, noninvasive detection of apoptosis have been previously unavailable.

In the present study, we applied angle-resolved low coherence
interferometry (a/LCI; refs. 11, 12), a noninvasive light scattering
technique that is highly sensitive to changes in subcellular
structure, to the study of apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
The a/LCI technique provides an alternative to imaging for
probing subcellular morphology. With this method, the change in
momentum of photons due to interaction with a sample is
examined to quantitatively probe its structure (13). The main
advantage of a/LCI is that it is a nonperturbative optical modality,
i.e., it uses light in the spectral region known as the ‘‘therapeutic
window’’ for optical imaging (near IR wavelengths; ref. 14). The
optical therapeutic window is especially important for in vivo
diagnostic techniques because major tissue chromophores, such as
water, hemoglobin, and melanin, do not absorb light at these
wavelengths. We show that, by using a/LCI to measure the fractal
dimension (FD) of structures within MCF-7 cells treated with
paclitaxel and doxorubicin, we can sensitively distinguish between
control cells and cells undergoing apoptosis within three hours of
treatment.
The a/LCI method has been developed to detect neoplasia in
animal models by measuring changes in nuclear morphology
(15, 16) and, more recently, has been applied to assess nuclear deformation in studies of cellular response to environmental stimuli
(17). A/LCI and other light scattering techniques have shown the
ability to assess FD in biological samples (13, 15, 18, 19). Moreover,
light scattering techniques, including a/LCI, have been used to
assess apoptosis in vivo (15) and in cell studies (20–23). The
present study extends this previous work by sensitively detecting
early changes in response to apoptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic
drugs. Additionally, the present study points to FD as an important
indicator of structural changes in cells specifically related to
apoptosis. Finally, mechanisms for structural changes that affect
the FD are quantified and explored to better understand the
rubric of FD and its potential for indicating apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
a/LCI. a/LCI, which is outlined in detail in references (11, 12), obtains
depth-resolved measurements of the far-field diffraction of a biological
sample, which corresponds to a cell monolayer in the present study. Low
coherence interferometry permits the rejection of multiply scattered light
that can cause noise artifacts in the signal. The signal resulting from an
a/LCI measurement is processed to isolate the scattering from individual
cell nuclei and all smaller organelles in the ensemble while eliminating
contributions from long range correlations within the monolayer (24). The
processed nuclear scattering profile is then analyzed using an inverse
light scattering analysis (ILSA) algorithm to determine the properties of
the nucleus (shape, size, etc.). Traditional ILSA algorithms for analyzing
scattering from biological samples have generally used Mie theory, a model
of spherical scatterers; however, in the present study, the ILSA algorithm
uses a T-matrix light scattering model (25), which predicts scattering from
spheroidal scatterers. The T matrix–based ILSA algorithm has been shown
to yield accurate measurements of the average equal volume diameter,
EVD, and the average aspect ratio, q, of stretched microspheres in tissue
phantoms (26) and cell nuclei in monolayers (27).
The predicted nuclear scattering profile can now be subtracted from the
original data, which comprises nuclear scattering plus scattering due to
smaller organelles, to isolate the slowly varying background in the
scattering signal, which corresponds to smaller organelles (smaller than
f2 Am). This residual scattering signal is Fourier transformed to yield the
two-point density correlation function of small organelles, which generally
exhibits a power law function. Density correlations that obey a power law
indicate self-similarity in a distribution (28); in the cellular materials

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (3). February 1, 2009

investigated in the present study, the power law form held over one to two
orders of magnitude of size scale (13). The exponent of the power law can
be physically interpreted as representing a mass fractal in three dimensions,
and can be used to deduce the mass FD.
The T-matrix database used for the ILSA algorithm computed scattering
from spheroidal particles with EVD ranging from 7.8 to 12.2 Am, q ranging
from 0.56 to 0.9, size distributions of 7% and 10%, background index of
refraction from 1.35 to 1.36, and scattering refractive index from 1.42 to 1.43.
These ranges of values are based on quantitative image analysis of MCF-7
cell samples and published values for cellular refractive indices (29). A leastsquares fitting of the processed scattering data were used in the ILSA
algorithm to determine the most probable scattering configuration from the
database. For more extensive details concerning a/LCI optics, processing of
the a/LCI signal, the ILSA algorithm, and the statistical techniques, please
see Supplementary Methods.
Cell culture. MCF-7 breast cancer cells, obtained from the Duke
University Cell Culture facility, were maintained in minimal essential
medium a (Invitrogen), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 mmol/
L HEPES (Invitrogen), 1 nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1 sodium
pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1 Ag/mL insulin (Invitrogen), 1 Ag/mL hydrocortisone
(Sigma), and 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (Sigma). For a/LCI measurements, MCF-7 cells were plated at 2.5  105 cells per well in 2-well
chamber slides and incubated over night at 37jC, 5% CO2. For all treated
samples, 5 or 50 nmol/L paclitaxel (sigma), or 5 Amol/L doxorubicin (EMD
biosciences) was added to growth medium and then the cellular medium
was replaced. The medium for the control (untreated) cells was changed at
the beginning of the experiment as well.
Flow cytometry. MCF-7 cells were plated at 2.5  105 cells per well in
6-well plates and treated in triplicate with either vehicle control (DMSO),
5 nmol/L, or 50 nmol/L paclitaxel for indicated times. Cell were trypsinized,
pelleted by centrifugation, and then fixed with 80% ethanol. Samples were
placed at 20jC until the day of analysis. On the day of analysis, cell pellets
were washed twice with PBS and then resuspended in 300 AL of
fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (1.37 mol/L NaCl, 27 mmol/L
KCl, 43 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 14.7 mmol/L KH2PO4, 1 mg/mL RNase A,
0.5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mg/mL propidium iodide).
Samples were analyzed by the Duke University Flow Cytometry facility for
DNA content.
Quantitative image analysis. MCF-7 cells were plated at 1  105 cells
per well in 4-well chamber slides and treated as described above. All
treatment groups were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and nuclei were
stained with DAPI (Sigma Aldrich). Samples were thoroughly washed with
PBS and mounted onto glass coverslips with Vectashield (Vector
Laboratories) before images were obtained with fluorescence microscopy
(Fig. 4A and B). Each sample was imaged (40) at 3 to 4 separate regions at
T = 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. These images were analyzed using ImageJ NIH image
processing software. Reported nuclear diameters are based on size
determinations for n = 70 cells. To compute box counting FD (box FD),
distinct cell nuclei were individually isolated and analyzed for a total of
f40 cell nuclei for each posttreatment time point. Each isolated nucleus
was converted to a binary image and the box FD was computed using
the built-in FD function in ImageJ. Box sizes of 2,3,4,6,8,12,16,32,64 pixels
were used. An important distinction exists between the box FD, which is
computed from two-dimensional images, and the mass FD, which is computed from the a/LCI data as a three-dimensional mass fractal (13). At all
times in the text, FD as computed by quantitative image analysis (QIA) will
be called box FD, and FD as computed by a/LCI will be called mass FD.
For MitoTracker experiments, MCF-7 cells were plated at 2.5  105 cells
per dish in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek) and incubated overnight at
37jC, 5% CO2. The following day, MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 nmol/L
paclitaxel for 3, 6, and 12 h. For control samples, the growth medium was
changed and cells were incubated in parallel to paclitaxel treated samples.
One hour before imaging, 100 nmol/L MitoTracker FM Green was added to
all samples. MitoTracker images were acquired using a Leica SP5 confocal
microscope (Duke University Light Microscopy Core Facility). MitoTracker
FM Green was excited at 488 nm and emission spectra were collected from
510 to 580 nm. Three to 4 images were taken per plate, 2 plates per

Statistical methods. All P values were calculated by using a rank sum

Results
Paclitaxel induces apoptosis and G2-M arrest in MCF-7 cells.
To determine the optimal concentration of paclitaxel to induce
apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of paclitaxel (0, 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 nmol/L) for
24 hours. Cells were fixed and stained with propidium iodide.
Flow cytometry cell cycle analysis showed that compared with
control cells (6.48% F 1.23%), 1 and 5 nmol/L concentrations of
paclitaxel induced a significant increase in the percentage of cells
with a sub-G1 content of DNA, 18.26% F 1.27% and 21.03% F
2.55%, respectively (Fig. 1). Furthermore, higher concentrations of
paclitaxel (10, 25, and 50 nmol/L), only induced an increase in cells
arrested in G2-M and not apoptosis (Fig. 1). To determine the
optimal time of exposure, MCF-7 cells were either left untreated or
treated with 5 nmol/L paclitaxel for 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours and fixed

and stained with propidium iodide for cell cycle analysis. As shown
in Fig. 2, 5 nmol/L paclitaxel induced a significant increase in cells
with sub-G1 content of DNA within 6 hours, 3.0 F 0.42 in control
cells to 5.07 F 0.25 in paclitaxel-treated cells. By 24 hours, f30% of
the paclitaxel-treated cells were apoptotic. A similar set of
experiments were performed with doxorubicin. We determined
that the optimal concentration of doxorubicin to induce apoptosis
in MCF-7 cells was 5 Amol/L, and, similar to paclitaxel-treated
MCF-7 cells, an increase in apoptotic cells was observed within 6
hours of treatment (data not shown).
a/LCI FD. Using T-matrix theory-based ILSA, the size and shape
of the MCF-7 cell nuclei (EVD) was found to agree with the results
of QIA of DAPI-stained samples to a high degree of accuracy
(Supplementary Fig. S3). We found no significant changes in
nucleus EVD or aspect ratio for treated or control cells throughout
the observation window, using either the a/LCI technique or QIA.
No discernible pattern was observed for the mass FD of the
paclitaxel-treated MCF-7 cells when using Mie theory–based ILSA
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, the T matrix–based ILSA
algorithm described above was instead used to determine the mass
FD of control MCF-7 cells and cells treated with 5 nmol/L
paclitaxel. These results show an increase in mass FD from
D = 1.63 F 0.44 (in the form of mean F SD) to D = 2.13 F 0.13
from t = 0 to 3 hours but then regressed slightly at t = 6 hours to
1.95 F 0.17. The mass FD increased to 2.00 F 0.24 and 2.02 F 0.14
at 12 and 24 hours, respectively. The mass FD of control cells
ranges from 1.50 to 1.70 with SD ranging from 0.20 to 0.40. The
mass FD of treated cells at t = 3, 12, and 24 hours shows statistically
significant differences from both control cells and treated cells at
t = 0 hours. The difference between the mass FD of treated cells at
t = 6 hours and control cells at the same time point are also
statistically significant, but at this time point, there is not a
statistical significance between treated cells at t = 0. All results
from treated and control groups are shown in Fig. 3A, which also
indicates where results are statistically significant.
To determine if the paclitaxel-induced changes in FD are specific
to taxane-based chemotherapy treatments, MCF-7 cells were
treated with doxorubicin, an anthracyline that inhibits topoisomerase II and inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. MCF-7 cells

were either left untreated (control) or treated with doxorubicin for
3, 6, 12, and 24 hours. In doxorubicin-treated MCF-7 cells, the mass
FD increased from D = 1.76 F 0.17 at t = 0 hours to D = 1.98 F 0.21
at t = 3 hours and then regressed slightly to D = 1.92 F 0.21 at t = 6
hours. The mass FD increased to 2.00 F 0.16 at t = 12 hours and to
2.06 F 0.09 at 24 hours. The mass FD of control cells range from
1.50 to 1.75 with SDs ranging from 0.15 to 0.40. The mass FD of
treated cells at t = 3, 12, and 24 hours represents statistically
significant differences from control cells and treated cells at t = 0
hours (Fig. 3B) with again no statistically significant differences
seen between the t = 0-hour and the t = 6-hour time point.
To investigate if changes could be detected at earlier time points,
MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 nmol/L paclitaxel and compared
with control cells at t = 1.5 hours posttreatment. The T matrix–
based ILSA algorithm determines the mass FD to be D = 2.05 F
0.20 at this time point, compared with D = 1.59 F 0.26 for the
control cells, a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The
mass FD of treated cells at t = 1.5 hours represents a highly
statistically significant difference from control cells and treated
cells at t = 0 hours (Fig. 3C).
MCF-7 cells treated with 50 nmol/L paclitaxel arrest in the G2-M
phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 1). Therefore, to determine if the a/LCI
mass FD results are indicative of apoptosis, MCF-7 cells were either
left control or treated with 50 nmol/L paclitaxel for 3, 6, 12, and
24 hours (Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly, there is a significant
difference between the mass FD of treated cells and control cells at
t = 3 hours, after which point the mass FD recovered to the same
as control cells; no statistically significant differences exist beyond
3 hours.
QIA box counting FD of cell nuclei. The box FD was computed
by QIA of images (Fig. 4A and B) taken from DAPI-stained MCF-7
cells either left untreated or treated with 5 nmol/L paclitaxel.
The FD of treated cells increased from 1.62 F 0.08 at t = 3 hours to
1.64 F 0.05 at t = 6 hours to 1.71 F 0.08 at t = 12 hours and t = 24
hours. The box FD of control cells was between 1.60 and 1.62 with a
SD of 0.05 at all time points. The differences between FD of treated
and control cells are statistically significant at t = 12 and 24 hours.

a/LCI Detects Early Structural Changes

5 nmol/L Paclitaxel for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h or 3, 6, and 12 h, respectively. For
nuclei, box FD is assessed by QIA of DAPI-stained images using fluorescence
microscopy. For mitochondria, box FD is assessed by QIA of MitoTracker FM
Green-stained images using confocal fluorescence microscopy.

t = 12 hours was 1.63 F 0.06, whereas the box FD of control cells at
t = 12 h was 1.59 F 0.07. At each time point, the difference in box
FD between treated and control cells is statistically significant
(P < 0.05), and the difference at t = 3 hours and t = 12 hours is highly
significant (P < 0.001). See Fig. 5B for summary of results.

Discussion
Fractal dimension is a measure of the texture of an object: as a
mass distribution transitions from a fine, smooth structure to a
coarser, grainer structure, the FD increases. We have shown that
the mass FD of MCF-7 cells, assessed through the angular light
scattering profile, provides an early and sensitive indication of
apoptosis. More specifically, in both doxorubicin- and paclitaxeltreated cells, the mass FD increases dramatically, with an increase
of up to 30% soon after treatment, and remains at an elevated level
as the cells undergo apoptosis. Differences for both types of
treatment are statistically significant shortly after treatment (1.5–3
hours posttreatment) as well as at later time points, when the cells
present more traditional markers of apoptosis induction (12 and
24 hours posttreatment). The fact that statistically significant
changes in FD are seen for both treatments indicates that the
changes are not drug specific.
We hypothesized that the mass FD would change as the
cells underwent apoptosis due to nuclear fragmentation and/or
condensation. Analysis of DAPI-stained images indicated that the
box FD did increase to elevated levels at 12 and 24 hours, which

www.aacrjournals.org

could explain the elevated mass FD assessed by a/LCI at those time
points. More surprising, and more significant, was the finding of
early changes in mass FD, as early as 1.5 hours in 5 nmol/L
paclitaxel-treated cells. It is probable that this change occurs due
to structural changes in another organelle. Due to the sensitivity
of light scattering to mitochondrial morphology (30, 31), we
hypothesized that these organelles were largely responsible for the
early, and possibly, later observed changes in mass FD. Our analysis
of MitoTracker FM Green–stained cells supports this hypothesis.
We see significant changes in box FD after 3 hours of treatment
with 5 nmol/L of paclitaxel in the mitochondria images. We note
that there is an important distinction between computing box FD
using fluorescence images and mass FD using a/LCI. Namely,
although microscopic imaging is subject to the diffraction limit
(f400 nm), a/LCI is sensitive to changes in structure well below
the diffraction limit. With this in mind, we acknowledge that there
are a number of other organelles that could experience structural
changes due to apoptosis-related events soon after treatment. Mass
FD would be sensitive to any changes in subcellular organization,
even those not necessarily detectable by image analysis, provided
that the affected organelles undergo topological changes that result
in changes in scattered light. However, our data supports the
hypothesis that the nucleus and mitochondria are both, at least
partly, responsible for the changes in FD.
Two other noteworthy results are the trends in mass FD for both
doxorubicin-treated and 5 nmol/L paclitaxel-treated cells, and the
differences in mass FD between 50 nmol/L and 5 nmol/L
paclitaxel-treated cells. First, for both 5 nmol/L paclitaxel- and
doxorubicin-treated cells, there is an increase in mass FD up to
3 hours, and then a slight reversal at 6 hours followed by a steady
increase through 24 hours. Although these trends are not
statistically significant, they do manifest in both treatments.
The presence of these trends in both treatments lends credence
to the possibility that there are at least two distinct mechanisms
responsible for the changes in mass FD, which occur in two
different temporal windows posttreatment. Additionally, the
presence of the trend for both apoptosis-inducing treatments
indicates that these two distinct mechanisms are inherent to
structural changes that occur during, or leading up to, apoptosis.
As previously stated, our analysis indicates that mitochondrial
structural changes are partly responsible for at least the early
changes in mass FD, whereas nuclear substructure changes are at
least partly responsible for later changes in mass FD.
The second noteworthy finding was that 50 nmol/L paclitaxel
treatment caused early changes in mass FD, which then reverted
to nearly the mass FD of control cells at later time points. The
differences between the mass FD of 50 nmol/L paclitaxel-treated
cells and control cells are not statistically significant after 3 hours.
This finding is important because the 50 nmol/L paclitaxel
treatment did not result in apoptosis within the observation
window. This indicates that the early changes seen in mass FD are
not necessarily related to apoptosis but rather to general structural
changes in cellular organelles due to events that may lead to
apoptosis. For example, mitochondrial changes that occur in
response to cellular stress include mitochondrial swelling, and
mitochondrial fission and fusion (2, 8, 9, 32). One model of
apoptosis suggests that mitochondrial fission is required for and
precedes the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential during
apoptosis. However, there are reports that inhibition of mitochondrial fission does not block Bax/Bak-dependent apoptosis (32). Our
results lend further support to the notion that later changes in

FD are related to nuclear fragmentation and apoptosis, but early
changes are caused by a different cellular event that may involve
mitochondrial fission.
Previous light scattering studies have explored using FD for
detecting apoptosis and dysplasia, but the present study shows
stark and statistically significant differences early in treatment, and
across multiple treatments. The primary advance that yielded the
high degree of sensitivity showed in this study is the use of a T
matrix–based ILSA model that accounts for nuclear asphericity.
This is in contrast to previous techniques that relied on light
scattering model, which assumed spherical cell nuclei and
organelles. By removing the uncertainty that arises from incompatibility between the shape of the nucleus and the light scattering
models previously used in ILSA, we find that the determination of
subcellular structures is more accurate and sensitive. Future
applications of light scattering can exploit this increase in
sensitivity by using a T matrix–based ILSA algorithm (or another
light scattering model appropriate for nuclear shapes) for assessing
mass FD. As a general quantitative assessment of changes in cell
structure and organization, mass FD presents a potential new
avenue for assessing changes in cell function including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and others.
In conclusion, noninvasive, high-throughput light scattering
methods such as a/LCI, are a sensitive indicator of subcellular
structure. In the present study, we have used a/LCI to measure FD

of subcellular structures to distinguish between cells treated with
apoptosis-inducing drugs and control cells. Moreover, the mass FD
of treated and control cells presents significant differences very
soon after treatment. Our studies with image analysis of
fluorescently tagged organelles indicates that changes in mitochondrial morphology are partly responsible for early changes in
FD, whereas changes in nuclear structure are largely responsible for
later changes in FD. These findings suggest that light scattering can
be a powerful noninvasive tool for monitoring apoptosis in both
basic research experiments and clinical treatments.
