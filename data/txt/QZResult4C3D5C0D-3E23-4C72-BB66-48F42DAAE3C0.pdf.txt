Abstract
Ewing Sarcoma (ES) shows several deregulated autocrine
loops mediating cell survival and proliferation. Therefore,
their blockade is a promising therapeutic approach. We
previously reported the in vitro effect of insulin-like growth
factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)/KIT pathway blockade on ES cell
lines, and we now extend our observations to changes induced
by this treatment in interacting proteins/networks. A proteomic analysis revealed that Heat Shock Protein (HSP)90 was
differentially expressed between ES cell lines sensitive and
resistant to specific IGF1R/KIT inhibitors. We therefore inhibited HSP90 with 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin
(17-AAG) and siRNA, and observed that ES cell line growth and
survival were reduced, especially in the resistant cell lines.
Conversely, HSP90 induced–expression conferred resistance
to anti-IGF1R/KIT treatment in the sensitive cell lines. 17-AAG
treatment induced HSP90 client protein degradation, including
AKT, KIT, or IGF1R, by inhibiting their physical interaction with
HSP90. Xenograft models developed with A673 ES cell line
confirmed that HSP90 inhibition, alone or combined with
IGF1R inhibition, significantly reduced tumor growth and
expression of client proteins. Remarkably, using two independent clinical sample sets, we have found that nearly half of
IGF1R-positive tumors also show HSP90 overexpression. This
delineates a subset of patients that could benefit from
combination of anti-HSP90 agents when considering IGF1Rtargeting therapies. Importantly, sensitivity to drugs such as
ADW/IMA depends not only on the levels of expression and
basal activation of IGF1R/KIT, but also, and for the first
time reported in ES, on the development of the stress
response mechanism. Accordingly, HSP90 expression could be
a predictive factor of response to IGF1R-targeting therapies.

Introduction

pathogenesis. Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and KIT
are transmembrane receptors that mediate two of these loops
(3–13). In vitro studies showed promising results on inhibiting
IGF1R, and, arguably, KIT, (5, 9, 12–14), suggesting possible uses in
clinical therapy.
Drug sensitivity depends on several molecular mechanisms,
including response to stress. Key molecules involved in response
to stress are Heat Shock Proteins (HSP). These are chaperone
proteins that help to maintain protein stability, renature unfolded
proteins, or target their degradation (15–17). Several of their
client proteins are involved in signal transduction pathways that
lead to proliferation, apoptosis, or cell cycle progression in several
cancers (18, 19), and therefore, HSP inhibition became a new
therapeutic strategy to inhibit multiple receptor pathways. Stressprotective HSP are often overexpressed in neoplastic tissues and
cancer cell lines (18–22). In addition to their protein refolding
activity, they are involved in apoptosis regulation, cell growth
regulation, and anticancer drug resistance, and a correlation
between elevated HSP levels and cancer progression has been
shown (19). Among HSP, HSP90 is one of the major chaperones
whose expression is increased in stress situations, having AKT,
HIF, p53, ErbB2, or Raf-1 as client proteins (20–22). Currently,
several specific HSP90 inhibitors are available, such as Geldanamycin or its derivate the 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin
(17-AAG), the last one already being used in clinical trials with good
results (23–27).
Based on our previous results (14), we performed a proteomic
analysis of ES cell lines under drug blockade of IGF1R and/or KIT
pathways to further study the following: (a) sensitivity differences
to IGF1R/KIT inhibition among ES cell lines, (b) affected networks
at the proteome level, and (c) to find and validate new possible
therapy targets. Our results showed that HSP90 was the protein
showing consistently the highest expression changes, raising the
possibility that targeting HSP90 might be of therapeutic value in
ES, especially in cases of previous resistance to IGF1R/KIT pathway
blockade.

Ewing Sarcoma (ES) is a neoplasm affecting children and young
adults, in which 5-year survival rates remain around 70% (1, 2). ES
expresses several deregulated autocrine loops that contribute to its

EWS-FLI type 3 fusion, and TTC466 has a EWS-ERG fusion, as previously
reported (28–31).3
Clinical samples. Two sets of clinical samples collected before
treatment were used. The first one, including 23 samples from ES
(n = 10) and other sarcomas used as controls, belongs to the consultation
files of one of the authors (EA). The second one, used to confirm data
in an independent set of samples [sections from two tissue arrays
(TMA) including samples from 44 ES patients] was provided by other
author’s files (C. Poremba). Both sets corresponded to patients with
similar clinicopathologic features, belonging to 23 men and 18 women,
with an average age of 26 years old (18 in the ES cases). Fifty percent of
the ES cases were localized in the lower extremities (20.8% in the tibia
and 16% in the femur), 12.5% in the upper extremities, and 21% in the
pelvis. Metastasis in the lung, bones, or medulla at the moment of
diagnosis was detected in 42% of them. Institutional Review Board
approval was obtained in both institutions. Clinical data were not
available in 26 cases.
Drugs. ADW742(ADW), AEW541(AEW), and Imatinib (Gleevec-Glivec,
IMA) were kindly provided by Novartis Pharma AG. 17-AAG was purchased
from Alexis Biochemicals. All these compounds were resuspended in DMSO
(10 mmol/L) and aliquoted at the desired working concentrations.
Two-dimensional electrophoresis. Cell lines were treated with
0.1 Amol/L ADW742 and/or 10 Amol/L Imatinib, for 24 and 72 h.
Afterwards, cell lysates were obtained by scraping treated cells on ice with
500 AL of lysis buffer [1% NP40, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L EDTA, 10%
glycerol, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7), protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche),
50 mmol/L NaF and 2 mmol/L Na3VO4]. Proteins were precipitated with
trichloroacetic acid/acetone and solubilized in a buffer containing 7 mol/L
Urea, 2 mol/L Thiourea, 2% CHAPS, and protease inhibitors.
Total protein [100 Ag; estimated using the PlusOne Quant kit (GE
Healthcare)] was loaded in 250 AL of rehydratation solution [8 mol/L
Urea, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.2% (w/v) DTT, 0.5% (v/v) IPG Buffer, and
0.002% bromophenol blue] and then used to reswell a 13-cm IPG strip pH
3-11 (GE Healthcare) for at least 12 h. Isoelectrofocusing was performed in
an Ettan IPGphor apparatus (GE Healthcare) at 30,000 V.h at 20jC.
Reduction, and alkylation were accomplished following manufacturer’s
instructions (Bio-Rad). Second-dimension SDS-PAGE gels (10% or 12%)
were stained with silver nitrate. Differentially expressed protein spots
were trypsinized and processed for MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry
analysis. Proteins were identified by matching their peptide-mass fingerprintings against the Swiss-Prot nonredundant human database (minimal
score change cutoff was set to 65). At least three independent experiments
were performed. The results obtained represent the average of three
experiments.
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems) was performed to
display the most relevant networks that changed with treatment.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Studies were performed
to assess inhibition of HSP90 client protein expression after 17-AAG
treatment, the technique being performed as previously reported (14).
Immunoprecipitation (IP) studies were carried out to detect physical
interaction of HSP90 with its client proteins. The total protein extract
(1.5 mg) was immunoprecipitated with anti-HSP90, anti-AKT, anti-KIT and
anti-IGF1R antibodies, and protein G-sepharose beads for 6 h at 4jC and
then washed 4 with lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted into loading buffer
by heating for 5 min at 95jC. Immunoblotting was then performed. Two to
three independent experiments were performed, and the final data
presented as the average of all replicates.
The antibodies used were as follows: anti-HSP90 (Alexis Biochemicals),
anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam), anti-IGF1R
(Santa Cruz Biotech), anti-CD117 (Dako), and anti-AKT, anti-pAKT
(Ser473), anti–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), anti–p-mTOR
(Ser2448), anti–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)42/44, and anti–p-

MAPK42/44 (Thr202/Tyr204; all from Cell Signaling). Anti-HSP90 was a
monoclonal-specific antibody, and anti-GAPDH, IGF1R, CD117, Akt, p-AKT,
mTOR, p-mTOR, MAPK42/44, and p-MAPK42/44, were polyclonal antibodies. All of them have previously analyzed for antigen specificity in our
laboratory, being all conditions optimized for specific antigen detection,
with elimination of nonspecific reactivity.
Proliferation studies. First, dose-response proliferation of the cell lines
under 17-AAG treatment was analyzed to determine the IC50 of
proliferation. Second, the percentage of proliferation inhibition was
evaluated in cell lines treated with 17-AAG combined with ADW742 or
Imatinib. Four to six independent experiments were performed, being final
data presented as the average of all replicates.
To determine the rate of proliferation, we used the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, as previously described (14).
Apoptosis. Apoptosis was measured after treatment with 17-AAG alone
or with ADW or IMA for 72 h. Apoptotic and necrotic index were assessed
by flow cytometry, as previously described (14). Three to five independent
experiments were performed, being the final data presented as the average
of all replicates.
siRNA. HSP90 validated siRNA and Silencer-negative control siRNA
were purchased from Ambion. Briefly, A673 and TTC466 cell lines were
cultured as above described. Cells in log-phase growth were harvested
by centrifugation at 1,500 g for 5 min; resuspended in 200 AL of
medium with 75 nmol/L HSP90siRNA, 5 AL NaCl 1.5 mol/L, and 20 Ag of
DNA carrier; and transferred to a Bio-Rad 0.4-cm electroporation
cuvette. Electroporation was done with a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at
126 V/800 AF. Cells were transferred to 10 mL of culture medium and
allowed to grow 24 h before drug treatment. Cells were grown using the
same conditions described above. Proliferation and apoptosis induction
were analyzed by the MTT and flow cytometry methods, respectively
(as described).
HSP90 transfection. HSP90 clone was obtained from Invitrogen
Ultimate ORF clones resource, and efficiently transferred to a Gateway
Destination Vector (Invitrogen PCDNA3.1(+), catalog nj V790-20), previously ligated with RfcassetteA from the Invitrogen Gateway Vector
Conversion System (catalog nj 11828-029), using the Gateway LR Clonase
Enzyme mix (catalog nj 11791-019), according to manufacturer’s instructions. The Gateway Destination Vector containing the HSP90 clone or the
Vector Alone (Mock; 15 Ag) were transfected in A4573, SK-ES-1, and TC71
cell lines, by electroporation, as above described. Proliferation and
apoptosis induction were analyzed by the MTT and flow cytometry
methods, respectively.
In vivo studies. Four- to 5-wk-old female NOD/scid mice (supplied by
Charles River’s Lab) were used, following the Spanish and European Union
guidelines (RD 1201/05 and 86/609/CEE, respectively). A673 ES cells in midlog growth phase were used to induce tumors because it was the most
representative cell line of drug resistance to ADW/IMA treatment. Cell
suspensions [5  106 cells in 0.2 mL 1:1 cellular medium:Matrigel Matrix
(ref. Nj 35624; BD Bioscience)] were injected s.c. into the right flank mice.
Mice were randomized into controls and treated groups 1 wk after tumor
started to be measurable (2–3 wk after injection; day 0 of treatment), and
mice with tumor volume higher than 1 cm3 were excluded from analysis.
Treatment were as follows: vehicle 1 (25 mmol/L tartaric acid, p.o., twice
daily, 7 d/wk for 2 wk); vehicle 2 (PBS Tween 80 0.05% DMSO 10%, i.p., twice
daily, 5 d/wk, for 2 wk); 17-AAG (alone, i.p., twice daily, 80 mg/kg/d, on days
0–5 and 8–12); AEW541 (alone, p.o., twice daily, 50 mg/kg/, 7 d/wk for 2 wk),
or 17-AAG (same conditions) plus AEW541 (same conditions). The tumors
were measured every 2 to 3 d with a caliper, and the diameters were
recorded. Tumor volume was calculated by the formula a 2bk/6 where a is
the smallest diameter and b the biggest one. At the end of the experiment,
mice were sacrificed by anesthesia overdosing and tumors were collected
for histopathology analysis.
Pathologic analysis. In the case of mice models, tissues were sampled in
<15 min after mice sacrifice and representative areas were (a) formalin fixed
(12 h) and paraffin embedded, and (b) snap frozen and stored at 80jC. In
the case of the clinical samples, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections

were used. All sections were stained with H&E and prepared for
immunohistochemical (IHC) study.
We used two sets of clinical samples of ES collected before treatment for
confirmation of the in vitro/in vivo results.
For IHC, 2 cell conditioning periods of 8 min at 95jC and 4 min at 100jC
on hot plate using buffer TRIS-EDTA (pH 8.0) buffer [except for IGF1R, in
which citrate buffer (pH 6.0) was used] were performed on previously
dewaxed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. Sections were then
incubated at 37jC for 1 h with antibody anti HSP90 (Alexis Biochemicals
ALX 804; dilution 1/500), IGF1R (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; dilution 1/50),
anti AKT (Cell Signaling Technologies #9272; dilution 1/500), anti-mTOR

(Cell Signaling Technologies #2972; dilution 1/50), and c-kit (Dako
Cytomation A4502; dilution 1/200). Staining was performed with the IHC
3,3¶-diaminobenzidine MAP system (Ventana Medical Systems). Results
were evaluated blinded to clinicopathologic and molecular data. The
number and intensity of immunoreactive cells were evaluated in three
randomly selected fields. Number was expressed as the percentage of
reactive cells. Intensity of staining was scored + to +++ (+, faint staining
intensity; +++, strong staining intensity). We considered immunoreactivity
>50% of cells as diffuse staining.
Statistical analysis. One-way ANOVA for independent samples was
performed, using the VassarStats web site for statistical computation.

Results
ADW742 and/or Imatinib treatment induce changes at the
proteome level in ES cell lines. Because we previously reported
on the effects of IGF1R/KIT circuit inhibition on ES proliferation,
survival, and pathway inhibition, and found synergistic effects
between several drugs (14), we now planned to perform an overall
study of ES cell proteome to have a general view of ADW742/
Imatinib effects. With this study, we aimed to assess the expression
changes of several relevant proteins that we could test as possible
targets/surrogate markers in ES.
We first treated ES cell lines A673 and A4573 (cell lines that, in
our experience, deeply differ on their sensitivity to treatment) with
0.1 mmol/L ADW742 and/or 10 Amol/L Imatinib, for 24 and
72 hours. Cell extracts were prepared and protein expression levels
were scrutinized for differences by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (see Fig. 1A).
A panel of proteins with different levels of expression was
compiled, as seen in Table 1. The proteins obtained were involved
in relevant cellular processes such as the regulation of proliferation
(EBP1, RhoA), apoptosis (Set, 14-3-3T), and stress-induced
responses (GRP75, HSP90, and HSP70; Fig. 1B). Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis was then performed to analyze the most relevant
networks altered with treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1D),
selecting a more reduced panel of relevant proteins [the ones that

www.aacrjournals.org

are marked with an asterisk (*) in Table 1], including HSP90, to
confirm the results obtained at protein and mRNA levels.
qRT-PCR and Western blotting (WB) showed that almost all of
the ‘‘selected proteins’’ had actually changed their mRNA and
protein expression levels with treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2D)
and confirmed that results are not just due to unspecific particular
cellular background. There were significant differences between
24- and 72-hour treatments, mainly showing the initial triggering of
cellular stress responses at 24 hours. At 72 hours, effects observed
were cell line specific and drug specific. There were significant
differences between the cell lines studied. We globally observed that
drug treatment alone had similar effects (with ADW742 or Imatinib)
and was less effective than the combination of both drugs. In
general, the overexpressed proteins were related to apoptosis, and
the ones that were underexpressed were related with proliferation
and stress-induced responses (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
HSP90 expression levels dramatically change with ADW742/
Imatinib treatment. Based on the above-mentioned results,
on the availability of HSP90-specific inhibitors, and its wellcharacterized involvement in cancer, we decided to study HSP90
role in the response to stress of ES cell lines.
Initially, we confirmed HSP90 expression changes after ADW
and/or IMA treatment, for 24 and 72 hours, in a panel of 5 ES cell
lines with different EWS-ETS fusion types (28–31).

As shown in Fig. 1C, HSP90 expression changed with treatment
in all cell lines and depended on each cell line. Globally, HSP90
expression increased at 24 hours of treatment in A673 and TTC466
cell lines and decreased in the others. HSP90 expression decreased
at 72 hours of treatment in all cell lines, especially in A673 cell line.
HSP90 blockade by 17-AAG inhibits ES cell proliferation and
survival by reducing activation of key HSP90 client proteins.
After confirming the expression changes of HSP90 in ES, we
decided to study its role on cell proliferation and survival by
performing specific inhibition using the geldanamycin derivate, the
17-AAG, in the same panel of ES cell lines.
All cell lines showed a dose-dependent inhibition of growth
(Supplementary Fig. S3D), at 24 and 72 hours of treatment, ranging
the IC50 at 24 hours from 1.01 to 1.62 Amol/L and at 72 hours of
treatment from 0.42 to 0.72 Amol/L (Fig. 2A).
The effects of 17-AAG treatment on apoptosis induction
depended on the ES cell lines treated. As depicted in Fig. 2B and
C and Supplementary Fig. S4D, induction ranged between 30% and
25% in TTC466 and A673 cell line, and 8% to 20% in the others,
with a much higher effect in the late apoptosis/necrosis levels than
in early apoptosis.
These results were explained, at least in part, by 17-AAG
treatment effects on HSP90 client protein expression. We observed
that 17-AAG per se (Fig. 3A) inhibited IGF1R, KIT, and AKT
expression, which, in turn, reduced phosphorylation levels of AKT,
mTOR, and MAPK42/44. These effects were more evident in A673
cell line than in A4573, in which there was nonsignificant
degradation of IGF1R or c-kit. The IP studies showed that IGF1R,
KIT, and AKT had their physical interaction with HSP90 reduced by
17-AAG treatment. Once again, we observed that the interaction
between HSP90 and IGF1R or KIT was much weaker in sensitive
cell lines to ADW/IMA (A4573, SK-ES-1, and TC71) than in A673
and TTC466 cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5D; Fig. 3B).
HSP90 blockade by 17-AAG sensitizes ES cell lines resistant
to ADW742 or Imatinib treatment. Because 17-AAG treatment
alone seemed to be actually effective in A673 and TTC466 cell lines
(which are cell lines that in our experience were highly insensitive
to ADW or IMA treatment; ref. 14) and this treatment reduces
p-AKT, p-mTOR, and p-MAPK42/44, we decided to assess the
combination of this drug with IMA or ADW and study their effects
on proliferation and apoptosis induction.
We observed that combinations of 17-AAG with ADW or IMA
resulted in an additional decrease of 15% to 50% in the proliferative
rate, depending on the sensitivity of each cell line (Supplementary
Fig. S6D). Drug combination with ADW was synergistic in almost
all cell lines [combination index (CI range, 0.35–0.9)] with the
exception of A4573 cell line. In the case of 17-AAG combination
with IMA, we observed synergistic effects in A673 and TTC466 cell
lines (A673: CI range, 0.53–0.9; TTC466: CI range, 0.44–0.796).
We then performed apoptosis studies and observed a dosedependent induction of apoptosis by ADW/IMA treatment. The
effect of combining 17-AAG with ADW or IMA resulted in an
additional increase of 10% to 50% in apoptosis depending on the
cell line (Supplementary Fig. S4D; Fig. 2B and C). We mainly
observed additive effects but, again, we detected synergistic effects
(CI range, 0.5–0.7) in A673 and TTC466 cell lines when combining
17 AAG+ADW or IMA, reaching levels of survival of only 25%
(Supplementary Fig. S4D; Fig. 2B and C). Once again [as previously
described (14) at the level of apoptosis induction], the differences
of sensitivity to treatment of each cell line were more evident in
combined treatments. Although we could observe that A673 and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

TTC466 were more resistant to single treatment than the other
cell lines.
HSP90 levels are determinant of the response of ES cell lines
to ADW/IMA treatment. To confirm that the inhibition obtained
with 17-AAG treatment was due to HSP90 blockade, we performed
an additional study based on a siRNA approach, in which we
reduced HSP90 expression in the cell lines resistant to ADW/IMA
treatment. Conversely, to prove our hypothesis that HSP90 high
expression could be conferring resistance to ADW and/or IMA
treatment, we studied the effect of HSP90 overexpression in cell
lines sensitive to ADW/IMA treatment.
As expected, HSP90siRNA (that reduced HSP90 expression in
35–65%, as depicted in Fig. 4A) improved ADW or IMA effects in
inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis; the results being
very similar to those obtained with 17-AAG (Supplementary
Fig. S7D; Fig. 4B). We observed a decrease of 20% to 30% in the
proliferative rate and 15% to 40% in the apoptosis induction of cell
lines treated with HSP90siRNA, when compared with the notreatment or HSP90siRNA-negative control conditions. These
results confirmed not only our hypothesis but also that the results
obtained with 17-AAG treatment are specific to HSP90 inhibition
and not due to alternative effects of this drug.
Our hypothesis was also confirmed with the HSP90 overexpression studies. We obtained HSP90 overexpression in control
conditions, and expression levels increased during ADW/IMA drug
treatment (Fig. 4C). As depicted in Fig. 4D and Supplementary
Fig. S8D, HSP90 overexpression increased proliferation, conferring
resistance to apoptosis induction by ADW/IMA treatment in all
cell lines analyzed. Apoptosis induction was drastically blocked
(no >20% of apoptosis induction in all treatment conditions, values
almost equal to control) and proliferation was induced, having
values above nontreatment control. All conditions had proliferation
values above 75%, much more than the nontransfected conditions.
These results were not simple transfection effects because
transfection with Mock did not affect neither HSP90 expression
(data not shown), nor proliferation or apoptosis of the cell lines.
HSP90 inhibition, alone or combined with IGF1R inhibition,
reduces tumor growth in vivo. After the in vitro studies, we tested
17-AAG treatment effects, alone or combined with AEW541 in a
xenograft model using A673, an IMA/ADW-resistant cell line. This
drug is an ADW742 analogue that has the same IGF1R inhibition
mechanism but is much more specific for IGF1R showing less toxic
effects, the latter being important for ethical reasons (32).
This in vivo study confirmed our in vitro results. Although the
control group showed an increase in median tumor size of 340% at
the end of the study and of 270% in AEW group, the increase was
only of 74% in the 17-AAG group, and 38% in the combination
group (Fig. 5A). Animals treated with AEW alone showed a similar
behavior to the control group, whereas animals treated with
17-AAG alone did not show a tumor growth reduction but a
slowing down during the 2 weeks of treatment, compared with the
control group. However, animals treated with drug combination
(AEW+17-AGG) not only experimented a slowing down of growth
but a marked reduction in the median tumor size, next to 40%
(Fig. 5A). The effect of drug combination was even higher in those
animals that had initially tumor volumes below average tumor size,
in which tumor size reduction reached 66%.
Histopathology studies showed that tumors treated with drug
combination were not only smaller, but also showed more
extensive necrotic areas (as depicted in Fig. 5B). Interestingly,
expression of total IGF1R and AKT diminished in the tumors

treated with 17-AAG, alone or in combination with AEW, with
respect to their untreated controls, in agreement to their role as
HSP90-client proteins. In contrast, expression of total mTOR did
not change with 17-AAG treatment (Fig. 5D).
A subset of IGF1R-positive clinical samples also shows
expression of HSP90. HSP90, IGF1R, and KIT expression was
analyzed in both ES clinical sample sets. Prevalence of expression of
these three molecules was similar between both series of samples.
IGF1R expression was cytoplasmic and relatively uniform among
tumor samples, in both sets of samples (5 of 10, 50% in EA samples;
33 of 44, 75% in the TMA). Intensity was moderate to intense. HSP90
expression was cytoplasmic, sometimes with a dot-like pattern, and
uniform within the tumor (3 of 10, 30% in EA samples; 19 of 44, 43%,
in the TMA). Intensity was weak to moderate. KIT expression was
detected at the cellular membrane, with a heterogeneous signal
among tumor samples (7 of 11, 64% in EA samples; 21 of 44, 48% in
the TMA). Intensity was also moderate to intense.
Interestingly, when comparing IGF1R and HSP90 expression, we
found that almost half of IGF1R+ samples were also HSP90+.
Conversely, almost 80% of the HSP90+ samples had also IGF1R
expression (see Table S1 in Supplementary Data). KIT expression
showed a clear overlap with IGF1R expression.

Discussion
Search for new therapeutic approaches is an urgent need in
sarcomas. IGF1R blockade (12, 13) is a promising approach in the

therapy of ES (14, 32–38). Having this in mind, and considering our
previous experience on the synergistic effects of in vitro
combination of IGF1R/KIT pathway blockade with vincristine
and doxorubicin on ES cell lines (14), we studied the global
proteomic changes induced by treatment with these drugs and
perform a molecular validation of possible drug target candidates.
We assume that stress response is important in ES because drug
treatment provoked changes in several proteins involved in different
levels of chaperoning complex formation. Drug treatment changed
the expression levels of HSP70 and 90, which are involved in the
formation of the early and intermediate stress response complex (22),
respectively, but also those of p23, a protein that is involved in the
mature stress response complex formation. Changes in the expression
patterns largely depended on the cell line used, not correlating to the
translocation type or additional abnormalities previously reported,
such as p16/INK4 loss or p53 mutation (28–31, 39–41).
Based on the results obtained, we had four evidences that
pointed to a possible HSP90 involvement in ES:
1. The major group of proteins with expression changes (Fig. 1B)
was related with stress responses;
2. HSP90 appeared four times (Supplementary Fig. S1D) connecting several networks in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis;
3. HSP90 was one of the proteins whose expression changed
in both cell lines studied (A673 and A4573), both at the mRNA
and protein levels, suggesting a common cellular response
mechanism; and

Figure 3. 17-AAG effects on HSP90 client protein expression
and phosphorylation in ET cell lines. A, A673 and A4573
cell lines were treated with 0.25 Amol/L 17-AAG for 24 and
72 h, IGF1 was stimulated for 10 min, and proteins were
extracted. Drug treatment resulted in degradation of IGF1R,
c-kit, and AKT, and in decreased AKT, mTOR, and MAPK42/44
phosphorylation. The levels of degradation largely depended
on the cell line used, A673 being much more sensitive to
treatment than A4573, in which we only saw weak degradation
of IGF1R and KIT. B, 17-AAG effects on physical interaction of
HSP90 with some client proteins. A673 cell line was treated
with 0.1 Amol/L 17-AAG for 72 h, IP against HSP90, c-kit, AKT,
and IGF1R was performed, and proteins were extracted. All
studied proteins are present in Total Extract (TE ; first lane
from left ) and c-kit, AKT, and IGF1R are coimmunoprecipitated
with HSP90 (eighth lane from left ). 17-AAG treatment
resulted in loss of interaction of IGF1R, c-kit, or AKT
with HSP90 (ninth lane from left ). Client proteins do not
‘‘crossimunoprecipitate’’ with each other (in each blot, we do
not observe any other client protein signal than the one
specifically being imunoprecipitated, together with the HSP90
signal) because HSP90 only can be interacting with one client
protein at a time, IP signal only being observed for the client
protein to whom it is chaperoning.

Figure 4. Induced HSP90 expression changes effects in ES cell lines. A, HSP90siRNA effects on HSP90 expression of A673 and TTC466 cell lines. Subconfluent
cells were transfected with HSP90siRNA (75 nmol/L), grown for 24 h, and then HSP90 expression was analyzed. HSP90siRNA reduced HSP90 expression in 35% to
65%, whereas negative control siRNA (siRNAneg control ) had no effects. B, antiproliferative effects of HSP90siRNA combined with ADW/IMA. Subconfluent cells
were transfected with HSP90siRNA (75 nmol/L), grown for 24 h, and then treated with ADW742 (0.1–0.5 Amol/L) or Imatinib (5–15 Amol/L Imatinib) for an additional 72
h, and proliferation was analyzed by MTT. HSP90siRNA inhibited proliferation, results very similar to those obtained with 17-AAG, with a decrease of 20% to 30% in
the proliferative rate when compared with the no-treatment control or negative control siRNA conditions. C, time course of HSP90clon transfection effects on
HSP90 expression. Subconfluent cells were transfected with HSP90clon (15 Ag), grown for 96 h, and then HSP90 expression was analyzed. HSP90clon effectively
induced HSP90 overexpression, and these levels of expression were increased during drug treatment. A4573 cell line was the one with higher HSP90 overexpression.
D, HSP90clon transfection combined with ADW/IMA effects on proliferation. Subconfluent cells were transfected with HSP90clon (15 Ag), grown for 24 h, and then
treated with ADW742 (0.1–0.5 Amol/L) or Imatinib (5–15 Imatinib) for an additional 72 h, and proliferation was analyzed by MTT. HSP90 overexpression increased
proliferation in all the studied cell lines having values above nontreatment control. All conditions had proliferation values above 75%, much more than the nontransfected
conditions. *, P < 0.05, determined with one-way ANOVA for independent samples.

Therefore, we decided to check HSP90 expression in a larger
panel of ES cell lines, including five cell lines with different fusion
types. HSP90 protein expression dramatically increased in A673
and TTC466 cell lines (both insensitive to ADW/IMA, as we
previously reported; ref. 14) at 24 hours of treatment, whereas it
was slightly reduced in the other cell lines. We hypothesized that
this finding could explain, at least in part, the insensitivity of A673

growth slowing down, and animals treated with drug combination (AEW+17AGG) had a marked reduction in the median tumor size, next to 40% (*, P < 0.05; *, 17-AAG

HSP90 Blockage in Ewing Sarcoma

and TTC466 to KIT/IGF1R inhibiting drugs. We suggest that these
cell lines have a well-developed mechanism of stress-induced
response that helps it to counterbalance drug treatment effects,
being triggered at the early phases of treatment (up to 24 hours),
and making it more resistant than the other cell lines. We then
studied the effects of HSP90-specific inhibition, using the
geldanamycin derivative 17-AAG in the same panel of 5 ES cell
lines. This drug inhibited ES cell line proliferation and survival in
a dose-dependent manner. There was a strong induction of
apoptosis in A673 and TTC466 cell lines, which we showed to be
resistant to ADW/IMA treatment but not in the other cell lines.
We suggest that this is due to the fact that A673 and TTC466 do
have a well-developed HSP90 stress response mechanism. It could
be argued that A673 cell line would be more dependent on HSP90
inhibition because it has a BRAF mutation (39); however, TTC466
cell line has a similar behavior but lacks mutations in that
particular gene, and there is no evidence for other genetic
changes [such as p53 mutation (40) or p16/INK4 loss (41)] that
could explain these results, suggesting independence on genetic
abnormalities of these cell lines. We consider that these results
are also transcript independent because TTC466 has a different
fusion type than A673 and has similar behavior, whereas TC-71,
that also has a EWS-FLI1 fusion type1, has a different behavior
than A673.
We have shown that 17-AAG treatment down-regulated IGF1R,
KIT, and AKT expression by reducing their physical interaction
with HSP90. Phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, and MAPK42/44 was
also diminished, and therefore, inhibition of proliferation and
apoptosis induction took place, at least, through inhibition of these
signaling pathways. Direct physical interaction of HSP90 with KIT
and AKT has already been reported (22, 43); our results being
expected because AKT has been extensively described as a HSP90
client, and it has been reported that 17-AAG down-regulates KIT
protein level (44). Although receptor tyrosine kinase or hormone
receptors (19, 21–23, 45, 46) are HSP90 client proteins, and several
groups have shown IGF1R inhibition by treatment with HSP90
inhibitors (47–49), as far as we are aware, IGF1R has not been
previously reported to be a client protein of HSP90. In this case, we
showed physical interaction by IP, although in future, a detailed
thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of the HSP90-IGF1R
interaction should be performed. This is an interesting finding, as
IGF1R signaling pathway is very relevant in sarcoma pathogenesis
(6–10, 14). We can suggest two possible ways of resistance
mechanisms: (a) IGF1R function is maintained after treatment
because of its interaction with HSP90 and (b) HSP90 is also
conferring resistance through other pathways related with
proliferation and apoptosis by stabilizing client proteins such as
AKT or KIT.
Using the siRNA technology in cell lines resistant to ADW/IMA,
we confirmed that the results obtained with 17-AAG treatment
were in fact due to HSP90, transforming these cell lines into
sensitive ones. On the other hand, with the reverse approach,
inducing HSP90 overexpression in the ADW/IMA treatment–
sensitive cell lines, we managed to increase their resistance to
treatment, reaching levels of complete apoptosis blockade and
proliferation high stimulation, confirming our hypothesis that
stress-response development is a mechanism of resistance to
treatment in ES.
Because malignant tumors are the cumulative result of
multiple oncogenic changes, monotherapy is readily bypassed
via collateral pathways. Therefore, inhibition of HSP can be used

www.aacrjournals.org

in combination with other drugs to reduce acquired resistance
from cells during malignant progression to conventional treatment. We raise the possibility that 17-AAG treatment could
improve ES cell susceptibility to ADW/IMA treatment, disrupting
several survival and resistance signaling proteins, specifically
A673 and TTC466, which were largely insensitive to both drugs.
For that reason, we decided to test the effects of combining
17-AAG+ ADW or IMA on ES cell lines proliferation and
apoptosis induction. Our results confirmed this assumption and
further showed that the design of drug combinations can be very
efficient, and that drugs must be combined in a tissue/
cell-specific manner. KIT relevance in ES is questionable (5).
Nevertheless, our results suggest that combination of imatinib
and 17-AAG might find a therapeutic application beyond ES,
especially in some cases of imatinib-resistant GIST or dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, by inhibiting HSP90 action.
Although our hypothesis was confirmed in vitro by several
approaches, we also tested it in xenograft models. Here, we have
found that A673 tumor cells (resistant to ADW/IMA treatment)
respond very well to 17-AAG treatment, alone or combined with
AEW541 (an ADW742 analogue, more specific and less toxic).
Accordingly, the IHC studies showed degradation of HSP90-client
proteins upon treatment, which explains our observations of a
slowing-down effect in tumor size evolution, as previously
described (50). In the case of drug combination, HSP90 inhibition
not only stopped growth but also reduced tumor size during the
experiment, confirming our suggested approach of combining
HSP90+IGF1R inhibition in ES treatment.
Analogously to what we have shown in ES cell lines, a
significant subgroup of clinical samples also showed diffuse
HSP90 expression. This was obviously not related to stress
induced by drugs because biopsies were taken before treatment.
This result, however, suggests that stress-response mechanisms
are already active in some ES patients at diagnosis. In these
patients, HSP90 overexpression could be a marker of resistance to
IGF1R blocking agents. Remarkably, using two independent
sample sets, we have found that nearly half of IGF1R positive
tumors also show HSP90 overexpression. This delineates a subset
of patients that potentially would benefit from combination of
anti-HSP90 agents when considering IGF1R-targeting therapies.
This underscores once again the need to study HSP90 expression
levels in samples of patients enrolled in clinical trials using IGF1R
blocking agents.
In summary, we have shown through in vitro and in vivo
studies that HSP90 is a potential therapeutic target in ES. In vitro
inhibition of HSP90 with 17-AAG or HSP90 siRNA targets several
signaling pathways relevant to sarcomas, being especially useful
in cell lines insensitive to Imatinib or ADW742 and in vivo HSP90
inhibition, alone or combined with IGF1R inhibition, reduces
tumor growth. We therefore suggest new mechanisms of
resistance to treatment not yet described in ES. HSP90 inhibition
also showed to be synergistic with ADW/IMA treatment, and
therefore could be of therapeutic value in ES. Lastly, in view of
the recent launch of clinical trials using IGF1R inhibition in ES,
HSP90 expression could be evaluated as a predictive factor of
response to treatment.
