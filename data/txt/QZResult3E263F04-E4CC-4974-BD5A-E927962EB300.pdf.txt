ABSTRACT
Vinegar-baked Radix Bupleuri (VBRB) is reportedly used to treat liver cancer
when combined with traditional chemotherapy and data show that this combination
may modify drug transport. We isolated clerosterol from VBRB and studied its effect on
drug transporters in normal or transporter-overexpressing cells. Transporter activity
was assayed using cellular substrate concentration and transporter expression with
Western blot and RT-qPCR. Clerosterol decreased cisplatin uptake in BRL cells mainly
through increasing Mrp2 gene expression. Clerosterol also decreased the uptake of
colchicine in HEK 293 cells by increasing both Pgp and Mrp1 activity; in detail, it could
increase Pgp protein but had marginal effects on Mrp1 protein and gene expression.
Further study showed clerosterol increased OCT2 activity in HEK293-Pgp cells by
increasing OCT2 protein and mRNA. Clerosterol could suppress Pgp overexpression
but not by regulating protein and gene expression. And clerosterol had marginal
effects on Mrp2 and Mrp1 activity in Mrp2- and Mrp1-overexpressing HEK293 cells.
Thus, Clerosterol may be an active constituent of VBRB and may work against cancer
multidrug resistance by inhibiting Pgp activity.

(a VBRB representative) with chemotherapy, such as
cyclophosphamide (CTX) or cisplatin, improves the
quality of life in animals as well as inhibits cell growth
and promotes hepatic tumor apoptosis [4, 5]; however,
the effective constituents in VBRB and its mechanism of
action are unclear.
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the main cause
of decreasing chemotherapeutic tumoricidal activity.
Overexpression of ABC transporters is related to MDR,
and the main transporters are P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and
multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRPs/Mrps)
[6, 7]. Radix Bupleuri was reported to reverse multidrug
resistance in liver cancer [8, 9], so modulating transporter
expression may explain increasing antitumor efficacy.
OCT2/Oct2 is an influx transporter that moves cationic
compounds, and it may be an ideal target for reducing
ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity of chemotherapeutics
[10, 11]. Thus, we studied P-gp, Mrp1, Mrp2, and
OCT2 transporters and underlying mechanisms of their
modulation.

INTRODUCTION
Liver cancer is often fatal, as patients are often
diagnosed at late stages of the disease. For those who
can be treated, surgical resection is often the first-line
treatment, frequently accompanied by chemotherapy
[1]. Drugs used to treat hepatic cancers have many side
effects and inter-individual therapeutic efficacy, and drug
resistance is an increasing problem. Thus, a method for
increasing treatment efficacy is desired.
Often, drug combinations offer more therapeutic
potential than single agents, and smaller doses may be
used of each to reduce side effects. Radix Bupleuri, the
dry radix of Bupleurum Chinese DC and Bupleurum
scozonerifolium, is a widely applied Traditional Chinese
Medicine, used to treat fever and other diseases. It has
been used to treat liver-related diseases after being
baked with vinegar. Clinically, VBRB with traditional
chemotherapy may be promising as a novel treatment
for liver cancer [2, 3]. Data show that Xiao Caihu Tang

Clerosterol had marginal effects on BRL and
HEK293 cell viability

Our previous work indicated that ethyl acetate and
n-butanol fractions were active constituents of VBRB.
The n-butanol fraction mainly contains saikosaponins and
several investigations about the effect of saikosaponins
on liver cancer and mechanisms behind this activity
have been published [12–14]; however, the ethyl acetate
fraction has not been studied much. Thus, we investigated
effective compounds of the ethyl acetate fraction and
mechanisms of such activity.

Viability was assessed in BRL and HEK293 cells
treated with clerosterol (0.24–243.0 μM) and data showed
no inhibitory effects of clerosterol treatment on BRL cells
up to 24.3 μM and in HEK293 cells up to 121.5 μM, so
these thresholds were used for additional experiments.

Identification of HEK293-OCT2, HEK293Mrp2, and HEK293-Pgp stable cell lines

RESULTS

After screening G418 for 8 weeks, transfection
efficiency of HEK293-OCT2, HEK293-Mrp2, HEK293Pgp, and HEK293-vector cells (transfected with
pCMV6-AC-GFP plasmid cells) were measured with
flow cytometry (Figure 2) and the data were as follows:
76%, 69%, 66%, and 82%. Western blot confirmed that
stable transfected HEK293-OCT2, HEK293-Mrp2, and
HEK293-Pgp cells overexpressed OCT2, Mrp2, and Pgp
proteins, and vector cells hardly expressed OCT2, Mrp2,
or Pgp proteins. RT-qPCR data confirmed that compared to
the vector cells, OCT2, Mrp2, and Pgp mRNA expression
in HEK293-OCT2, HEK293-Mrp2, and HEK293Pgp cells was increased by 3.21, 4.07, and 2.99 times,
respectively (Figure 3). Thus, HEK293-OCT2, HEK293Mrp2, and HEK293-Pgp cells were stably transfected.

Clerosterol characterization
Compound 1 was obtained as a white needle-like
crystal. EI-MS showed a quasi-molecular ion at m/z 413
[M-H]-, so the molecular formula was assigned as C29H48O
combined with 13C NMR data (C × 29). 1H NMR and 13C
NMR spectra showed signals as follows: 1H NMR (500
MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.35 (1H, brd, J = 5.2 Hz, H-6), 4.72
(1H, dd, J = 1.4, 2.5 Hz, H-27b), 4.64 (1H, d, J = 2.5 Hz,

H-1b, H-22), 1.00 (3H, s, H-18), 0.90 (3H, d, J = 6.6 Hz,
H-21), 0.80 (3H, t, J = 7.4 Hz, H-29), 0.67 (3H, s, H-19).

17.9 (q, C-26), 12.2 (q, C-18), and 12.0 (q, C-29). NMR
data agreed with the literature [15], so compound 1 was
identified as clerosterol (Figure 1B), representing the first
isolation from Radix Bupleuri.

Effect of clerosterol on activity and Oct2 and
Mrp2 in BRL cell protein and mRNA expression
After clerosterol treatment (24.3 μM) of BRL cells
for 24 h, cisplatin uptake decreased by 53.0% (P < 0.05)
(Figure 4A). Western blot data confirmed that clerosterol
increased protein expression Oct2 by 11.6% (Figure 4B)
and Mrp2 by 23.2% (Figure 4D). RT-qPCR data show that
clerosterol increased mRNA expression of Oct2 by 78.7%
(P < 0.05) (Figure 4C) and Mrp2 by 207.5% (P < 0.01)
(Figure 4E). Thus, clerosterol decreased cisplatin uptake
via increased Mrp2 expression.

Effect of clerosterol on Pgp and Mrp1 activity,
mRNA, and protein in HEK293 cells

Clerosterol increased OCT2 activity in HEK293OCT2 cells

Treatment with clerosterol (121.5 μM) for 48
h decreased colchicine uptake by 43.6% (P < 0.01)
(Figure 5A). In order to distinguish the contribution of
Pgp or MRP1 on colchicine uptake, we used MK571
or verapamil as Mrp1 or Pgp inhibitors, respectively.
For 48 h in HEK293 cells, colchicine uptake increased
in both suggesting that both transporters contributed
to colchicine efflux (the second bar of Figure 5B and
5C). Clerosterol had no significant effect on colchicine
uptake when compared to the MK571-control group
or verapamil-control group, but showed a tendency of
decreasing colchicine uptake (the third bar of Figure 5B
and 5C). These indicated that colchicine uptake decrease
is based on the co-effect of promoting both Pgp and MRP1
activity. Clerosterol increased Pgp protein expression by
102.8% (P < 0.05) (Figure 5D) and had no significant
effect on Mrp1 protein expression (Figure 5F). RT-qPCR
data suggested that either of these changes were not
biologically significant (Figure 5E and 5G). Thus, our
data suggested that clerosterol increased Pgp activity by
altering Pgp protein expression, but for Mrp1, not through
translational regulation.

Transporter expression is typically enhanced or
inhibited in disease states, so we measured the effects
of clerosterol on OCT2 activity in HEK293-OCT2
cells and noted that after 24 h, clerosterol (121.5 μM)
treatment increased cisplatin uptake by 53.2% (P < 0.05)
(Figure  6A). Western blot confirmed that clerosterol
tended to increase OCT2 protein expression (Figure 6B)
and RT-qPCR showed that OCT2 mRNA expression was
increased by 132.4% (P < 0.05) (Figure 6C).

Clerosterol had marginal effects on MRP2
activity in HEK293- MRP2 cells
Clerosterol treatment of HEK293-MRP2 cells for 24
h produced no significant effect on cisplatin uptake (Figure
7A). MRP2 gene and protein data were in agreement with
these findings (Figure 7B and 7C).

Clerosterol inhibited Pgp activity in HEK293Pgp cells

substrate) uptake after Pgp transfection. Clerosterol or

verapamil (Pgp inhibitor) treatment of transfected cells
for 24 h caused increased rhodamine B uptake by 31.0%
and 20.5% (P < 0.01). Western blot and RT- q PCR data
indicated that clerosterol had no effect on Pgp protein
and mRNA expression in HEK293-Pgp cells after 24
h compared to the controls (Figure 8B and 8C). Thus,

uptake decreased and Mrp1 protein and gene expression
increased significantly compared to the controls (the
second bar of Figure 9A, 9B, and 9C). After MK571
(Mrp1 inhibitor) treatment, colchicine increased and Mrp1
protein and gene expression decreased compared with
the glutathione controls (the forth bar of Figure 9A, 9B,
and 9C). Thus, the Mrp1 activity enhancing model was
successful. Clerosterol did not change colchicine uptake
in glutathione-stimulated HEK293 cells, but it decreased
protein and mRNA expression compared to the glutathione
controls (the third bar of Figure 9A, 9B, and 9C). These
results indicated that clerosterol affected the protein and
mRNA expression of MRP1, but it did not affect MRP1
function.

at the VBRB-induced herb-drug interaction, therefore, we
investigated ethyl acetate parts of VBRB, and clerosterol
was found in VBRB for the first time.
Drug transporters are critical for therapeutic
efficacy and toxicity as well as herb-drug interactions [7,
17, 18]. VBRB may improve chemotherapeutic efficacy
and decrease toxicity and these actions may occur via

VBRB is usually used in liver cancer therapy as a

MATERIALS AND METHODS

drug transporters. Therefore, the effect of clerosterol on
transporters in normal and disease states was studied.
Cisplatin was used as both an Oct2 and Mrp2
substrate. Increased Oct2 transport activity increased
cisplatin uptake and increased Mrp2 transport activity
promoted cisplatin efflux, so we studied the effect of
clerosterol on the Oct2 and Mrp2 activity in normal
BRL cells by measuring cisplatin accumulation. Our
results showed clerosterol decreased cisplatin uptake.
In further protein and mRNA studies, we confirmed
that this effect is mainly through increasing Mrp2 gene
expression. Colchicine is a substrate for Pgp and Mrp1
so the effects of clerosterol on Pgp and Mrp1 activity in
normal HEK 293 cells were studied with colchicine as a
probe. Clerosterol decreased colchicine uptake, and this
effect was co-contributed by both Pgp and Mrp1. Cisplatin
and colchicine are common chemotherapy medicines, but
both are limited by toxicity and resistance. Our results
suggested that clerosterol might decrease the toxicity of
cisplatin and colchicines in normal cells by inhibiting their
uptake.
Multidrug resistance is an important problem in
chemotherapy. Overexpressing multidrug resistance
transporters is the main mechanism of drug resistance
[19, 20, 21] so we next studied the clerosterol effect on
transporters in transporter-overexpressing HEK293 cells.
Clerosterol inhibited Pgp expression in HEK293Pgp cells significantly when Pgp is overexpressed in
cancer cells, giving rise to multi-drug resistance and
chemotherapeutic failure. Pgp is reported to be found
in most organs, but its hepatic expression is in abundant,
suggesting that clerosterol may safely inhibit hepatic
Pgp [18].
MRPs are transporters that normally protect tissues
against exogenous compounds, and in disease states may
cause therapeutic failure [22]. Clerosterol’s effect on
Mrp1 and Mrp2 differs: clerosterol had marginal effects
on normal or enhanced Mrp1 activity and clerosterol
enhanced typical Mrp2 in BRL 3A cells, but had marginal
effects on overexpressed Mrp2 in HEK 293 cells. Thus,
clerosterol may not be useful for MRP-induced multi-drug
resistance. Mrp2 contributes to bile acid and bilirubin
transport, and decreased Mrp2 activity causes cholestasis,
which may be amenable to clerosterol treatment by
increasing Mrp2 activity.
OCT2 is an influx transporter that moves cationic
compounds and clerosterol enhanced OCT2 activity in
physilogical and pathological states. OCT2 contributes
to renal toxicity and ototoxicity of cisplatin [23, 24], so
clerosterol should likely not be co-administered with
cisplatin.
Collectively, clerosterol isolated from VBRB may
be an active constituent of the herb and may work against
cancer multidrug resistance by inhibiting the activity of
multidrug resistance transporters, especially Pgp.

Plant materials and clerosterol isolation
Decoction pieces of VBRB were purchased from
Kangmei Medical Company (Guangzhou, China),
and authenticated by Professor Rhizhi, Zhao (Second
Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou University of Chinese
Medicine). A voucher sample (120100341) was deposited
in the Laboratory of Chinese Medicine Preparation, at
the Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou University
of Chinese Medicine. Decoction pieces (10 kg) were
extracted with 80% ethanol 3 times (2 h each time). The
ethanol extract was filtered and concentrated using a
rotary evaporator. Crude extract was dissolved with ethyl
acetate (3,000 mL) and concentrated. The ethyl acetate
soluble fraction (178.6 g) was dissolved in ethyl acetate
and subjected to silica gel column chromatography using
petroleum ether-ethyl acetate (20:1-1:1) as the eluent. The
sub-fraction (petroleum ether-ethyl acetate, 10:1) yielded
a white crystal. Final purification was accomplished
by recrystallization with ethyl acetate to afford a white
needle-like crystal (compound 1, Figure 1A). The structure
of compound 1 was elucidated using NMR and MS.
Compound 1 (>98%) was evaluated with HPLC.

Viability assays

Colchicine uptake assay

Cell viability was measured using MTT assay.
Briefly, BRL and HEK 293 cells were seeded onto 96well plates (2 × 103 cells/well and 4 × 103 cells/well-1,
respectively). After incubation for 24 h at 37°C and 5%
CO2, 150 μL of clerosterol solution (243.0, 121.5, 48.6,
24.3, 12.1, 2.43, and 0.24 μM) was added and co-cultured
for 48 h. Then, 20 μL of MTT (50 g/L) was added to
each well for another 4 h and formazan formation and
dissolution in 150 μL of DMSO were performed. Optical
density was measured at 570 nm and control optical
density was considered 100% viability.

Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated
at 37°C until reaching a logarithmic growth phase.
Clerosterol and MK571 or verapamil were added and cocultured for 48 h. Then, cells were treated with 50 μM
of colchicine for another 60 min and harvested. After
freezing and thawing harvested cells with redistilled water
and centrifuging at 15,000 x g for 15 min, the supernatant
was collected. Then, 175 μL of sample was added with
3 volume of methanol and vortexed for 1 min. The
supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and evaporated
to dryness after centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min.
The obtained residue was dissolved in 175 μL of mobile
phase and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for another 15 min.
The supernatant was taken and injected (25 μL volume)
into HPLC. Separation was conducted using a Diamonsil
C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase was
water-methanol (45:55) with a flow rate of 1mL·min-1. The
column temperature was kept at 25°C and the detection
wavelength was 353 nm. Colchicine uptake was expressed
as colchicine/mg protein.

Stable HEK293 cells overexpressing OCT2,

HEK293 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and
grown to 80% confluency, then OCT2-pCMV6-AC-GFP,
Mrp2-pCMV6-AC-GFP, ABCB1-pCMV6-AC-GFP, and
pCMV6-AC-GFP plasmids were transfected with plasmid
DNA with a green fluorescent protein reporter gene. Genes
were introduced into HEK293 cells with MegaTran 1.0.
72 h after transfection, and HEK293 cells overexpressing
OCT2, Mrp2, and Pgp (HEK293-OCT2, HEK293-Mrp2,
and HEK293-Pgp) were established with aminoglycoside

efficiency was confirmed with flow cytometry, and
Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to measure protein
and mRNA, respectively.

Rhodamine B uptake assay
Fluorescent intensity of intracellular rhodamine B
was measured with flow cytometry. Cells at a logarithmic
growth phase were treated with clerosterol in 6-well
plates for 24 h, then the supernatant was removed and the
cells were washed with PBS. Subsequently, rhodamine
B was added. After being co-cultured in the dark for 30
min, cells were harvested and washed with PBS. Relative
fluorescence of intracellular rhodamine B was quantified
with flow cytometry (10,000 cells/experiment) for 3
independent experiments.

Cisplatin uptake assay
Cisplatin is a co-substrate of OCT2 and Mrp2 and
cisplatin uptake was expressed as cisplatin/mg protein.
Cells were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated at
37°C until reaching a logarithmic growth phase. Then,
clerosterol (24.3 μM in BRL cells, 121.5 μM in HEK293
-OCT2 or -Mrp2 cells) was added for 24 h. Subsequently,
cells were treated with 50 μg/mL of cisplatin for another
4 h and harvested. After freezing and thawing harvested
cells 3 times with cell lysate solution (Tris 100 mM,
EDTA 5 mM, NaCl 200 mM, SDS 0.2%, at pH 8), cell
lysate was centrifuged and supernatant was collected. A
175 μL sample after ultrafiltration or a 175 μL of cisplatin
standard solution was obtained and 10 μg of NiCl2 and 20
μL of DDTC solution (0.25 M) were added to each. The
mixture was vortexed for 1 min and incubated at 37°C in a
water bath for 15 min. Finally, 175 μL of chloroform was
added and the samples were centrifuged for 5 min after
vortexing for 1 min. The final solution was injected (10 μL

Western blot analysis
Cells were treated with clerosterol for 24 h and
harvesting, then lysed in RIPA cell buffer with protease
inhibitor on ice and vortexed 10 min, 3 times each. Then
cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 15 min
and supernatant was collected for protein measurement.
Protein samples were boiled in loading buffer for 5 min,
and separated by SDS PAGE. Proteins were transferred
to PVDF membranes at 100 V for 2 h, and membranes
were blocked for 1 h in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20
and 5% (w/v) dry skimmed milk powder. Membranes
were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies
to OCT2 (1:500), Mrp1 (1:1,000), Mrp2 (1:500), or Pgp

(1:1,000). Membranes were washed with TBS containing
0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with secondary
antibody. Protein bands were developed with ECL and
exposed on X-ray film. Developed blots were scanned and
quantified using a Gel Doc XR Image Analyzer (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Berkeley, CA). Densitometric assessment
of the target protein on blots compared to the reference
proteins was used to quantify the protein.

Fishers Least Significant Difference (LSD) test, and
Dunnett’s T3 was used for variance heterogeneity (p <
0.05 or p < 0.01 was regarded as statistically significant).

Quantitative real-time PCR experiments
Cells were treated with clerosterol for 24 h, and
then the total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1 μg of total RNA was
used as a template for each reverse transcriptase (RT)mediated PCR using a RevertAid First Strand cDNA
synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA),
as described in the manufacturer’s instructions. Realtime PCR was performed in 96-well plates using an
ABI 7500 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems,
UK). Primers were as follows: rat Oct2, forward
5’-CCGAGAATATGCAGAGGCCAA-3’ and reverse
5’-AAGTCAGCTCCAGCAGCA
