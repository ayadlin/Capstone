Abstract
By using LNCaP and its derivative cell lines, we first observed an association between tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) resistance and hormone independence. Moreover,
we found that the expression of tumor necrosis factor
receptor–associated death domain (TRADD) was reduced
in androgen deprivation–independent cells compared with
that in androgen deprivation–dependent cells. TRADD is a
crucial transducer for TNF-α–induced nuclear factor-κB
(NF-κB) activation. Knocking down TRADD expression in
LNCaP cells impaired TNF-α–induced NF-κB activation and
androgen receptor repression, whereas overexpression of
TRADD in C4-2B cells restored their sensitivity to TNF-α.
Finally, we found that androgen deprivation reduces TRADD
expression in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that androgen
deprivation therapy may promote the development of TNF-α
resistance by reducing TRADD expression during prostate
cancer progression. [Cancer Res 2009;69(24):9448–56]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and one of the
leading causes of cancer death in North American men. Initially,
most prostate cancers are responsive to androgen deprivation
therapy, which is achieved by chemical or surgical castration. However, these cancers relapse eventually and ultimately progress to
castration-recurrent disease that is resistant to not only hormone
deprivation therapy but also other systemic chemotherapy (1, 2).
Nonetheless, androgen receptor (AR) signaling remains critical
for castration-recurrent prostate cancers (3, 4).
The tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) pathway is also aberrantly
regulated during prostate cancer progression (5). TNF-α is a pleiotropic cytokine that exerts a variety of functions in inflammation,
immunity, cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and, paradoxically,
cell death (6). TNF-α is primarily produced by immune cells. However, it is also produced by numerous other cell types, including
epithelial cells of human prostate cancer (7). TNF-α binds to the
TNF-α receptor (TNFR1), leading to phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasome-mediated degradation of the inhibitor of
κB (IκB), which binds to and inhibits nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
activation by forming a complex in the cytoplasm. Degradation
of IκB results in the release of NF-κB, which then translocates to

the nucleus. In the nucleus, NF-κB regulates the transcription of
target genes, which promote cell proliferation or inflammatory responses. In most cells, TNF-α activates caspase-8 and induces apoptosis only when NF-κB activation is hampered (8). However, in
prostate cancer LNCaP cells, even if NF-κB signaling is activated,
TNF-α can still induce cell death in a dose-dependent manner (9).
This apparent discrepancy may be explained by the negative regulation of AR expression and activity by NF-κB (10, 11). Interestingly, androgen deprivation–independent (AI) prostate cancer cells
are mostly resistant to TNF-α, whereas androgen deprivation–
dependent (AD) cells are sensitive to it, suggesting an association
between androgen deprivation and TNF-α susceptibility (12). However, it remains unclear how prostate cancer cells lose their sensitivity to TNF-α as they progress.
Tumor necrosis factor receptor–associated death domain
(TRADD) was one of the first identified TNF-R1–associated proteins (13). TRADD contains a COOH-terminal death domain that
is 23% identical to the death domain of TNFR1 and can directly
interact with TNFR1 (13). The NH2 terminus of TRADD interacts
with the TNFR-associated factors TRAF1 (14), TRAF2 (15), and
TRAF3 (16). Thus, TRADD mediates TNF-R1–induced apoptosis
as well as NF-κB activation (13). Recent knockout studies also revealed TRADD-mediated functions in Toll-like receptor signaling
and antiviral immune responses (17, 18).
In this article, we report an association between reduced
TRADD expression and TNF-α resistance in AI prostate cancer cell
lines. Our data show that TRADD is critical for TNF-α–induced
NF-κB activation and AR suppression in prostate cancer. Furthermore, we show that androgen deprivation decreases TRADD expression in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that prostate cancer
cells may lose their TNF-α sensitivity after androgen deprivation
therapy.

TRADD Expression during Prostate Cancer Progression
Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from Chemicon. Dutasteride
was obtained from GlaxoSmithKline. Methyltrienolone (R1881) was purchased from DuPont.
RNA isolation, amplification, and quantitative reverse transcriptasePCR. Total RNA from cultured cells was isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared from
5 μg total RNA using the SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Tissues obtained at prostatectomy were frozen in optimal cutting temperature (OCT; Tissue Tek OCT, Sakura Finetek). Frozen prostate samples
embedded in OCT were used for separate laser capture microdissection of
stroma, benign and malignant epithelium as indicated. Approximately
2,000 to 3,000 cells per sample were collected using the Arcturus Veritas
LCM System and used for isolation of total RNA followed by two rounds
of linear amplification as we have previously described (19, 20). Primers
specific for genes of interest were designed using the National Center for
Biotechnology Information Web-based primer design tool Primer-BLAST.5
First-strand cDNA templates were generated from 1 μg of amplified RNA
using 1 μg of random primers (Invitrogen) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).
Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed with
SYBR green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems System Sequence Detector 7700HT. All reactions were assessed for
quality by examination of both amplification and dissociation curves. Samples were normalized using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) or RPL13A.
Primer sequences used in this study are the following: AR Fwd, GGAACAGCAACCTTCACAGC; AR Rev, CTTTAAGGTCAGCGGAGCAG; TRADD
Fwd, CGCATACCTGTTTGTGGAGTC; TRADD Rev, CGGTGGATCTTCAGCAATCTG; RPL13A Fwd, CCTGGAGGAGAAGAGGAAAGAGA; RPL13A
Rev TTGAGGACCTCTGTGTATTTGTCAA. Human GAPDH primers were
purchased from Applied Biosystems.
Cell lysate preparation and Western blotting assays. Whole-cell lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Nuclear and
cytoplasmic protein fractions were prepared with a Nuclear Extraction kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore). Equal amounts of
protein (30–80 μg) were loaded onto 10% NuPage Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen),
and electrophoresis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots
were probed with antibodies to evaluate protein expression.
Transfection and luciferase assay. Transfections by electroporation
were performed as described previously (21). For luciferase assays, cells
were harvested and lysed 2 to 3 d after transfections. Firefly luciferase
and Renilla luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined using a dual
luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Relative luciferase units were calculated as indicators of transcriptional activity.
Cell viability assay. Cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at
a density of 3,000 or 5,000 per well and treated as indicated. Cell viability
was assessed with the Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One solution cell proliferation
assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Clinical protocols. All procedures involving human subjects were approved by institutional review boards of participating institutions; all subjects signed written informed consent. Prostate tissue samples were
obtained from a clinical trial evaluating dutasteride (GlaxoSmithKline) before radical prostatectomy as previously described (22). Eighty-one men
ages 45 to 80 y with clinically localized prostate cancer (T1c-T2b), Gleason
scores of <7, and serum PSA of 2.5 to 10 ng/dL were randomized to immediate radical prostatectomy (n = 25) or 4 mo of 0.5 mg (n = 26) or 3.5 mg
(n = 24) of dutasteride orally daily preceding radical prostatectomy. Prostate tissue samples were also obtained from a recently completed clinical
trial of neoadjuvant castration therapy before prostatectomy. Fifteen men
ages 18 y or older with clinically localized prostate cancer (T1c-T2b),
Gleason scores of <7, and serum PSA of <20 ng/dL were randomized to

3 wk of castration with either leuprolide and bicalutamide (7.5 mg injection
and 50 mg orally daily, respectively; n = 7) or castration with transdermal
estradiol (E2; 0.6 mg every 3 d; n = 8). Untreated prostate tissue samples
were obtained from men undergoing standard radical prostatectomy as
described previously (23).
Prostate cancer xenograft tumors and immunohistochemistry
staining. AD and AI versions of LuCaP 23.1 and LuCaP 35 prostate cancer
xenografts were generously provided by Dr. Robert L. Vessella (University
of Washington, Seattle, WA). Tumors were propagated in severe combined
immunodeficient mice as described (24). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissues were cut into 5-μm sections, deparaffinized, and rehydrated in a
graded series of ethanol dilutions. Immunohistochemistry was performed
with the IHC Select Immunoperoxidase Secondary Detection System
(Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Results
TNF-α reduces prostate cancer cell viability through inhibition of AR expression and activity. Although elevated TNF-α
has been documented in prostate cancers (7), the effects of TNF-α
on prostate cancer cells still mainly remain unclear. Thus, we investigated the effect of TNF-α on the viability of LNCaP cells. The
results showed that TNF-α reduced LNCaP cell viability in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1A). Given the fact that TNF-α activates
NF-κB in LNCaP cells, it is paradoxical that TNF-α reduces LNCaP
cell viability. Mizokami and colleagues (7) first reported that TNF-α
represses AR expression in LNCaP cells and suggested that this
might be the underlying mechanism by which TNF-α inhibits prostate cancer cell growth and survival. To confirm the effect of TNF-α
on AR expression, we examined AR expression by Western blotting
after treating LNCaP cells with different doses of TNF-α. As expected, TNF-α reduced AR and PSA expression in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1B). To confirm that AR reduction was indeed caused
by TNF-α, we used a TNF-α–specific antibody to neutralize TNF-α.
TNF-α–neutralizing antibody totally abolished the TNF-α–induced
reduction of IκBα, AR, and PSA expression (Fig. 1C, left). Real-time
qRT-PCR also showed that the TNF-α–neutralizing antibody
blocked the TNF-α–induced reduction of AR at mRNA level
(Fig. 1C, right). To assess whether TNF-α–induced downregulation
of AR leads to a suppression of AR transcriptional activity, we used
a PSA promoter–driven luciferase reporter to monitor AR transcriptional activity. R1881, a synthetic androgen, greatly induced
AR transcriptional activity but cotreatment with TNF-α significantly suppressed androgen-induced AR transactivation (Fig. 1D),
indicating that TNF-α negatively regulates AR transcriptional
activity.
TNF-α–induced AR repression requires NF-κB activation.
Because NF-κB has been suggested to mediate TNF-α–induced
AR repression (11), we blocked NF-κB activation with an IκBα
super-suppressor (pcDNA-IκBαSS/AA-HA) to test whether TNFα–induced AR suppression requires NF-κB activation (25). TNFα–induced reduction of AR and PSA expression was totally
blocked by an IκBα super-suppressor (Supplementary Fig. S1),
suggesting that NF-κB is required for TNF-α–induced downregulation AR expression and activity.
AD and AI prostate cancer cells deferentially respond to
TNF-α. To determine whether TNF sensitivity is altered during
prostate cancer progression, we used a prostate cancer cell line
progression model. The model is composed of LNCaP, C4, C4-2,
and C4-2B cell lines (26–28). LNCaP cells are sensitive to androgen deprivation and have limited metastatic ability. On the other
hand, C4, C4-2, and C4-2B are resistant to androgen deprivation

and display more aggressive phenotypes. In many respects, the
development of these AI cell lines recapitulates the progression
of prostate cancer in vivo. Consistent with previous reports (9,
11), C4-2 and C4-2B are mostly resistant to TNF-α (Fig. 2A). In
contrast to a nearly 50% reduction in LNCaP cells, TNF-α only
reduced C4-2 and C4-2B cell viability by <20%, suggesting that
prostate cancers may develop TNF-α resistance as they progress.
We then asked whether TNF-α–induced AR suppression is absent or limited in AI cell lines. We treated LNCaP and C4-2 cells
with or without 20 ng/mL TNF-α and evaluated the expression of
AR and PSA. In contrast to that in LNCaP cells, TNF-α–induced
AR and PSA reduction was almost absent in C4-2 cells (Fig. 2B,
left). A TNF-α dose-response assay indicated that even as high as
50 ng/mL, TNF-α still did not significantly reduce AR or PSA
expression in C4-2B cells (Fig. 2B, right), confirming the resistance
to TNF-α in AI cells. Given the critical role of NF-κB in TNF-α–
induced AR repression, we speculated that NF-κB activation
induced by TNF-α might be blocked or reduced in AI cells. Therefore, we compared the phosphorylation levels of IκBα in LNCaP and
C4-2B cells after 1 hour of treatment with 20 ng/mL TNF-α. Consistent with the results of the NF-κB luciferase assay, TNF-α–induced

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (24). December 15, 2009

phosphorylation of IκBα at serine 32 and serine 36 was significantly
decreased (59%) in C4-2B cells compared with that in LNCaP cells
(Fig. 2C). Accordingly, the reduction of total IκBα in LNCaP cells
(51%, second lane versus first lane) was higher than that in C4-2B
cells (34%, fourth lane versus third lane). We then compared TNFα–induced NF-κB activity between these cell lines by a reporter
luciferase assay. Consistent with the results of IκBα phosphorylation, TNF-α strongly induces NF-κB activation in LNCaP cells. Although TNF-α–induced NF-κB activation was not totally blocked
in C4-2 and C4-2B cells, the amplitude of NF-κB activation was
much lower than that in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2D), suggesting that
TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway is impaired in AI cells. Collectively,
these studies indicate that the TNF-α resistance in AI cells might be
due to the impairment of the TNF-α/NF-κB signaling pathway.
TRADD expression level is correlated with TNF-α sensitivity
in AD and AI prostate cancer cells. To explore the underlying
mechanism by which AI cells develop increased resistance to
TNF-α, we next examined the expression of TNFR1 in AD and
AI cells. Consistent with previous studies (11, 29), TNFR1 expression was comparable at the protein level in all these cell lines
(Fig. 3A). We then examined the expression of other important

TRADD Expression during Prostate Cancer Progression

signal transducers in the TNF-α signaling pathway, including
TRADD, FADD, and RIP1. Interestingly, TRADD expression was
significantly decreased in C4-2 and C4-2B cells compared with
LNCaP cells, whereas RIP1 and FAS-associated death domain
levels were comparable (Fig. 3A). To evaluate the mRNA level of
TRADD, we designed a pair of TRADD-specific primers for realtime qRT-PCR assays. As shown in Fig. 3B, overexpressing TRADD
increased both protein and mRNA levels of TRADD, whereas
knocking down TRADD reduced both, suggesting that these primers are specific for TRADD. Using these primers, we then compared TRADD mRNA levels among these cell lines. Consistent
with the protein level, the mRNA level of TRADD declined from
LNCaP to C4-2B (Fig. 3C), suggesting a transcriptional regulation
on TRADD during prostate cancer progression.
TRADD is critical for TNF-α–induced NF-κB activation and
AR suppression. To test whether TRADD plays a critical role in
TNF-α–induced NF-κB activation and AR suppression, we knocked
down TRADD expression by TRADD siRNA in LNCaP cells. In
TRADD-competent LNCaP cells, TNF-α treatment resulted in a
strong IκBα phosphorylation, which consequentially reduced its
expression (Figs. 2C and 4A). However, in TRADD knocked down
cells, the TNF-induced IκBα phosphorylation was inhibited significantly (56% reduction). Accordingly, the total IκBα reduction was
not as significant as that in TRADD-competent cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that NF-κB activation is impaired in TRADD-deficient cells.
To further confirm the role of TRADD in TNF-α–induced NF-κB

activation, we evaluated NF-κB activity with a luciferase reporter
assay. As shown in Fig. 4B, TNF-α–induced NF-κB activity was
greatly inhibited in TRADD-deficient cells, demonstrating that
TRADD is important for TNF-α–induced NF-κB activation.
However, knocking down TRADD did not completely block TNFα–induced IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. It might
be due to the limited efficiency of TRADD siRNA. More importantly, recent studies on TRADD knockout mice suggest that a
strict dependence on TRADD for TNF-α–induced NF-κB activation
is cell type specific (30). In cells with very low levels of RIP1, such
as fibroblasts, TRADD deficiency almost completely abolishes
TNFR1-mediated signaling. However, in cells with abundant RIP1
expression, such as macrophages, RIP1 is sufficient to mediate
TNFR1 signaling in the absence of TRADD (17, 18). As shown in
Fig. 3A, prostate cancer cells express abundant RIP1. Therefore,
it is likely that RIP1 enables TNF-α to activate NF-κB at some level
even in the absence of TRADD.
To determine whether TRADD is critical for the effects of TNF-α
on AR suppression, we next evaluated the AR expression and activity after knocking down TRADD in LNCaP cells. As expected,
knocking down TRADD almost abolished the AR reduction induced by TNF-α (Fig. 4C). Accordingly, PSA reduction was also
abolished in TRADD-deficient cells. Furthermore, we evaluated
the nuclear AR levels in TRADD-competent and TRADD-deficient
cells. LNCaP were cultured in medium containing 9% charcoalstripped serum (CSS) and treated with or without androgens and

TNF-α. Nuclear AR levels were assessed as indicators for AR activity. As expected, androgens greatly increased nuclear AR levels in
cells transfected with control siRNA, but cotreatment with TNF-α
significantly reduced the nuclear AR accumulation induced by
androgens (Fig. 4D). However, in cells transfected with TRADD
siRNA, TNF-α did not significantly reduce nuclear AR levels. To
further confirm that TRADD is important for TNF-α–induced AR
suppression, we performed immunofluorescence staining with an
AR-specific monoclonal antibody to visualize AR expression and
localization. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, AR was localized
primarily within the cytoplasm in the absence of androgens.
Androgen treatment resulted in increased AR expression and
also translocation of AR into the nucleus. Cotreatment with
TNF-α significantly suppressed androgen-induced AR translocation in TRADD-competent cells but not in TRADD-deficient cells,
which is consistent with what we observed by nuclear AR Western blotting.
Collectively, these data suggest that TRADD plays a critical role
in TNF-α–induced NF-κB activation and AR suppression. Interestingly, the TNF-α response pattern in TRADD knockdown LNCaP
cells was very similar to that in C42B cells, implying that TNF-α
resistance in AI cells may be due to loss of TRADD expression.
Ectopic expression of TRADD restores the TNF-α–induced
AR repression in AI cells. To confirm that the reduced TRADD
expression in AI cells contributes to the resistance to TNF-α–
induced AR repression, we tested whether overexpression of
TRADD in C4-2B cells could restore their TNF-α sensitivity.
Because TRADD signals not only NF-κB activation but also cell
apoptosis (13), we used two different TRADD constructs: wtTRADD and TRADDΔ301. In the latter construct, 12 amino acids

at the COOH-terminal end were deleted (31). Deletion of the
COOH-terminal 12 amino acids abolishes its apoptosis-inducing
ability but does not abolish the ability to activate NF-κB (13). As
expected, overexpression of either wt-TRADD or TRADDΔ301 in
C4-2B cells potentiated TNF-α to activate NF-κB (Fig. 5A), confirming that TRADD-mediated activation is independent of apoptosis. Similarly, ectopic expression of either wt-TRADD or
TRADDΔ301 both enabled TNF-α to repress AR and PSA expression (Fig. 5B), suggesting that NF-κB activation, instead of apoptotic signals, mediates TNF-α–induced AR repression. Furthermore,
ectopic expression of either wt-TRADD or TRADDΔ301 both resensitized C4-2B cells to TNF-α treatment (Fig. 5C). Because
TRADDΔ301 lost its ability to directly induce apoptosis (31), the
reduction of cell viability is most likely due to AR repression instead of TNF-α–induced apoptosis.
Androgen deprivation suppresses TRADD expression
in vitro and in vivo. The next issue we addressed is to determine
the mechanism underlying the reduced TRADD expression in AI
cell lines. Because these cell lines were developed under selective
pressure of androgen deprivation, we questioned whether androgen deprivation affects TRADD expression. We investigated
TRADD expression in cells cultured in hormone-free medium
and found that removal of hormone significantly reduced TRADD
expression in LNCaP cells. Likewise, treatment with the antiandrogen bicalutamide or the SRD5A inhibitor dutasteride also significantly decreased TRADD expression (Fig. 6A, left), suggesting
that androgens are required to maintain a high level of TRADD
expression. Conversely, treatment with 1 nmol/L R1881 for
48 hours greatly increased TRADD expression, which could be
blocked by bicalutamide (Fig. 6A, right).

TRADD Expression during Prostate Cancer Progression

To determine whether TRADD expression is affected by androgen deprivation in vivo, we evaluated TRADD expression in
prostate tissue samples from a neoadjuvant clinical trial of dutasteride. As expected, following 4 months of dutasteride treatment, tissue dihydrotestosterone levels were significantly lower
than that found in untreated prostates, with concomitant increases in tissue testosterone. However, TRADD transcript levels
were not significantly different between prostate epithelial cells
acquired from untreated and dutasteride-treated prostate tissue
samples (Supplementary Fig. S3). As documented previously, although dutasteride lowers dihydrotestosterone levels, there are
concomitant higher levels of testosterone. Thus, the lack of a
dutasteride effect on TRADD in vivo might be due to high levels
of testosterone. We next measured TRADD expression in radical
prostatectomy samples resected from men treated with standard

androgen deprivation therapy with the LHRH agonist luprolide
and the antiandrogen bicalutamide, or with high doses of E2.
Compared with transcript levels measured in benign untreated
prostate epithelium, TRADD transcript levels in both benign
(P < 0.001) and neoplastic epithelium (P < 0.04) treated with luprolide + bicalutamide or E2 were significantly lower than
TRADD levels in untreated benign epithelium (Fig. 6B), confirming
a critical role of androgen on TRADD expression. Interestingly, we
also observed that in either the luprolide + bicalutamide or the E2
group, levels of TRADD transcripts in benign epithelium was lower
than that in neoplastic epithelium (Fig. 6B), suggesting that
TRADD is differentially expressed between normal and cancerous

TRADD expression is decreased during prostate cancer progression in vivo, we used the LuCaP 23.1 and LuCaP 35 prostate cancer
xenograft models. LuCaP 23.1 and LuCap 35 tumors grow in intact
immunocompromised mice and serve as a model for prostate cancer progression (32, 33). Both original LuCaP 23.1 and LuCaP 35
tumors regressed after castration but eventually recurred and became AI tumors. TRADD immunohistochemistry staining show
that the original LuCaP 23.1 and LuCaP 35 tumors (AD tumors)
express relatively high levels of TRADD, but castration-recurrent
LuCaP 23.1 AI and LuCaP 35 AI tumors express very little TRADD
(data not shown; Fig. 6D). Thus, both cell line and xenograft models strongly suggest that TRADD expression might be reduced as
prostate cancer progresses.

Discussion

suppression in AI cells. A, C4-2B cells transfected with pcDNA3.1,
pcDNA–wt-TRADD, or pcDNA-TRADDΔ301 were subjected to NF-κB-luc
luciferase reporter assay after 10 ng/mL TNF-α treatment for 24 h. Columns,
mean values from samples in triplicate; bars, SD. B, Western blotting evaluating
AR and PSA levels in C4-2B cells overexpressed wt-TRADD or TRADDΔ301

in human prostate cancers, we used laser capture microdissection
to acquire benign and cancerous prostate epithelial cells from 14 individuals with localized prostate adenocarcinoma. We quantitated
TRADD transcripts by qRT-PCR using the RPL13 mRNA as a reference control. Compared with benign epithelium, the expression of
TRADD was significantly lower in cancerous epithelium (P = 0.0138;
Fig. 6C).
Data from LNCaP cell line model suggested that TRADD expression might be altered as prostate cancers progress. To test whether

It is well established that both androgen/AR and TNF-α/NF-κB
signaling pathways are important for prostate cancer growth. The
mutual inhibition between these two pathways has been documented (34–36). Consistent with these studies, we showed that TNF-α
induces AR suppression in prostate cancer cells through NF-κB,
which may mediate TNF-α–induced reduction in cell viability. Unlike in many other cell types, activation of NF-κB by TNF-α in prostate cells does not promote cell proliferation. Conversely, it has a
proapoptotic effect (37). The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are largely unknown. One potential mechanism is that NF-κB
induces DR4 expression, which promotes TNF-related apoptosis
inducing ligand (TRAIL)–induced cell death in prostate cancer
cells (38). Our data suggest that TNF-α–induced AR suppression
may be another important underlying mechanism.
In contrast to our finding, some other studies suggested that AR
and NF-κB might enhance each other's activity (39, 40). In a recent
report, Jin and colleagues (41) observed that constitutive activation
of NF-κB in prostate cancer xenografts (in which IκBα was
knocked down) is correlated with increased AR expression, and
their data implied that NF-κB RelA increases AR expression and
contributes to prostate cancer progression. Chen and Sawyers
(42) identified four NF-κB binding sites in the PSA core enhancer
and showed that these sites are directly bound by NF-κB and activate PSA expression in the absence of androgen, suggesting that
constitutively active NF-κB might contribute to prostate cancer
progression. However, Cinar and colleagues (43) soon reported a
fifth NF-κB binding site in the core of the PSA promoter, which
is suppressive to AR transcriptional activity. Binding of p65, but
not p50, to this site represses, instead of activates, AR-mediated
PSA transcription. Collectively, the precise effect of TNF-α/NFκB on AR activity still remains unclear and it is likely dependent
on the specific cellular milieu.
The correlation between androgen deprivation resistance and
TNF-α resistance in prostate cells has been documented (11,
12). Ko and colleagues (11) reported that increased B-Myb
(a NF-κB coregulator) expression in AI cells affects the inhibitory
effect of NF-κB on the AR promoter, providing a potential mechanism for TNF-α resistance in AI prostate cancer cells. In our
study, we found an association between reduced TRADD expression and TNF-α resistance in prostate cancer cell lines. We also
showed that TRADD plays an important role in mediating TNFα–inducing AR suppression and that loss of TRADD expression is
associated with TNF-α resistance. Finally, we provided evidence
that androgen deprivation leads to a reduction of TRADD both
in vivo and in vitro. Considering the critical role of TRADD in

TNF-α–mediated signaling, we speculate that androgen deprivation therapy contributes to the development of TNF-α resistance
during prostate cancer progression. Therefore, our findings provide a potential mechanism by which prostate cancer develops
TNF-α resistance after androgen deprivation therapy.
