BACKGROUND. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ligand expression is
frequently seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A phase 2 study was performed with cetuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds specifically
to EGFR, in patients with advanced HCC.

METHODS. Eligibility criteria included unresectable or metastatic measurable
HCC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2, Cancer of
the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score 3, and adequate organ functions. The initial dose of cetuximab was 400 mg/m2 given intravenously followed by weekly intravenous infusions at 250 mg/m2. Each cycle was defined as 6 consecutive
weekly treatments. EGFR expression was assayed by immunohistochemistry and
trough serum concentrations of cetuximab were determined during the first
cycle.

RESULTS. Thirty patients were enrolled and assessable for efficacy and toxicity.

orldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer-related
death.1 In the U.S., 18,510 new cancers of the liver and intrahepatic
bile duct are expected to be diagnosed in 2006, with an estimated
16,200 deaths.2 Unresectable or metastatic HCC carries a poor prognosis and systemic therapy with cytotoxic agents provides marginal
benefit.3,4

alpha (TGF-a) in hepatocarcinogenesis. The expression of several EGF family members, specifically EGF,
TGF-a, and heparin binding-epidermal growth factor,
as well as the EGFR, has been described in several
HCC cell lines and in tissue.5–11 Recent data from 2
clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and modest efficacy of erlotinib, an oral EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, in advanced HCC.12,13 In the study by Philip
et al.,12 3 of 38 patients (9%) achieved partial responses
and 12 of 38 patients (32%) were free of disease
progression at 6 months. In another preliminary report
by Thomas et al.,13 8 of 25 patients (32%) achieved progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 months.
Cetuximab (IMC-C225, ERBITUX) is a chimeric
immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody that
binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumor cells. Cetuximab blocks the binding of EGF or
TGF-a to EGFR on the cell surface and inhibits ligandinduced receptor phosphorylation.14 Many studies
have demonstrated that cetuximab treatment alone
effectively inhibits proliferation of EGFR-positive
tumor cells in vitro and tumor growth in xenograft
models.14–16 Several clinical studies have demonstrated its activity as a single agent or in combination
with chemotherapeutic agents in refractory colorectal
cancer, head and neck cancer, and others.17–19 Cetuximab could inhibit the growth of HepG2 HCC cells in
a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner.20
Cetuximab may mediate its antitumor activity through
its effects on many important downstream signaling
pathways including apoptosis, cell cycle control, and
angiogenesis.21,22
The poor treatment outcome of systemic chemotherapy in HCC, the increased expression of EGFR in
HCC, the preliminary encouraging results with erlotinib in HCC, and the in vitro growth inhibition of HCC
cells by cetuximab prompted us to perform the current
phase 2 study to examine the efficacy and tolerability
of cetuximab in unresectable or metastatic HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
The protocol for this clinical trial was reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Review Board at DanaFarber/Harvard Cancer Center. All patients were
required to provide written informed consent before
study participation according to institutional and
federal guidelines. Eligibility criteria included histologically proven and measurable locally advanced,
recurrent, or metastatic HCC and no more than 2
prior systemic chemotherapy regimens. Prior chemoembolization therapy was permitted if performed
more than 4 weeks before study entry and measura-

ble disease was present outside of the prior chemoembolization field. Patients who had received
prior treatments were required to have documented
progressive disease before study entry. Patients were
also required to be at least 18 years of age; have an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0–2; Cancer of the Liver Italian
Program (CLIP) score 323; and adequate hepatic, renal, and bone marrow functions (serum bilirubin
3.0 mg/dL, aspartate transaminase 7 times the
institutional upper limit of normal, serum creatinine
2.0 mg/dL, absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 1.0
3 109/L, and a platelet count of 75 3 109/L).
Patients were required to have tumor tissue available
for assessment of EGFR status by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on diagnostic tissue. Exclusion criteria included a concurrent malignancy; significant
medical comorbidities; clinically significant cardiovascular disease including uncontrolled hypertension, myocardial infarction, and unstable angina;
major surgery within 28 days before the initiation of
study treatment; pregnancy or lactation; prior treatment with cetuximab or other therapy that specifically and directly targets the EGF pathway; prior
allergic reaction to chimerized or murine monoclonal
antibody therapy; known central nervous system
metastases; or an inability to give written informed
consent.

Treatment Protocol
The initial dose of cetuximab was 400 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 120 minutes, followed by
weekly infusions at 250 mg/m2 intravenously over 60
minutes. Each cycle consisted of 6 weekly treatments. All patients were premedicated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride at a dose of 50 mg (or an
equivalent antihistamine) intravenously 30 to 60
minutes before treatment.
Before study entry, all patients provided a complete medical history and underwent a physical
examination, including an assessment of ECOG performance status, weight, height, and concurrent nonmalignant disease and therapy. Laboratory studies
included a complete blood count, differential count,
platelet count, biochemistry (sodium, potassium,
chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, magnesium, and calcium),
hepatic and renal function tests, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Required radiologic studies included a
chest and abdominopelvic computed tomography
(CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scan. Serum hepatitis B and C serology were also
determined before treatment. A pregnancy test was

Cetuximab in Hepatocellular Carcinoma/Zhu et al.

obtained from all women of childbearing potential
within 7 days before the initiation of therapy.
During treatment, patients were monitored
weekly during the first cycle and once every 2 weeks
for the subsequent cycles for a brief history, physical examination, assessment of ECOG performance
status and toxicity, and laboratory evaluation. AFP
was performed before the beginning of each cycle.
CT or MRI scans were performed at the end of each
cycle. Response and disease progression were evaluated using the international criteria proposed by
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) Committee.24 Treatment was continued
until 1 of the following criteria was met: disease progression per RECIST criteria, unacceptable toxicity,
patient refusal, or the need to delay therapy more
than 3 weeks.

Toxicity Evaluation and Dose Modification
Toxicity was evaluated according to the National
Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (version 3.0) and cetuximab dose
modifications were performed as specified in the
protocol. If the patient experienced a mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) infusion reaction, the infusion rate
was permanently slowed by 50%. Cetuximab was immediately and permanently discontinued in patients
who experienced severe (grade 3 or 4) infusion reactions. If a patient experienced severe acneiform rash
(grade 3), cetuximab treatment adjustments were
made according to the following scheme: for the first
occurrence, cetuximab was withheld for up to 2
weeks and resumed at the same dosage when the
rash decreased to grade 2; for the second occurrence, cetuximab was withheld for up to 2 weeks and
resumed at 200 mg/m2 when the rash decreased to
grade 2; if there was no improvement in the rash
while withholding the treatment within 2 weeks,
cetuximab was discontinued. Rash was treated with
topical and/or oral antibiotics. For all other grade 3/
4 nonhematologic treatment-related toxicities, cetuximab was resumed when the toxicities resolved to
grade 2.

Immunohistochemistry of EGFR
Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were obtained at
the time of tissue biopsy and assessment of EGFR
status by IHC was performed as described previously.25 EGFR expression was recorded as negative
(0), weakly positive (11), positive (21), or strongly
positive (31). Results were interpreted as blinded
from patients’ identity and clinical outcomes data.

Pharmacokinetic Study
One venous blood sample (approximately 5 mL) was
collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of
trough (Cmin) serum cetuximab concentrations at
00:00 (predose) immediately before the start of the
infusion of cetuximab, beginning with the second
dose of cetuximab, and was continued for 5 weekly
doses (Weeks 2-6) in Cycle 1. Serum cetuximab
concentrations were determined using a validated
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by PPD (Richmond, Va). Recombinant human EGFR (full-length
receptor; ImClone Systems, Somerville, NJ) was used
as the capture reagent. Bound cetuximab was
detected using a peroxidase-conjugated, rabbit antihuman, IgG Fcg fragment specific antibody and
TMB-peroxide substrate. Serum was diluted at least
1000-fold with buffer (phosphate-buffered saline
containing 1% bovine serum albumin [BSA] and
0.05% Tween-20). The range of quantitation (at
1:1000 dilution) was 1.0 to 32.0 mg/mL. Linearity of
dilution was validated to a total dilution of 100,000fold, which extended the upper limit of quantitation
to 3200 mg/mL. From prestudy validation the withinassay and between-assay precision (%CV) was within
8.5% and 9.2%, respectively. The accuracy (percent of
nominal) was within 6.3%. Summary statistics were
derived from all measurable, observed individual
Cmin values at each study week using Microsoft
Excel 2002.

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of this phase 2 study was PFS.
The planned accrual was for 30 evaluable patients. If
the lower 80% confidence bound estimate for the
proportion of patients alive with no disease progression by 3 months exceeded 0.50 the regimen would
be considered for further investigation. The lower
80% confidence bound would exceed 0.50 if 18 or
more of 30 patients were alive with no progression at
3 months. If the true rate of PFS at 3 months was 0.7
(a median PFS of 5.8 months), the probability of
observing 18 patients with no disease progression
at 3 months would be 90%. If the true rate of PFS at
3 months was 0.50, this probability would be
18%. The secondary endpoints were to define toxicity profiles, response rate, and overall survival. Overall survival was defined as time from study entry
until death from any cause. Overall survival and PFS
were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and
confidence limits for survival estimates were calculated using the Greenwood formula. All categories of
toxicity and complications of the treatment were
recorded.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between February 2005 and October 2005, 30
patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC were
entered into this trial. No patients had fibrolamellar
or hepatocholangiocarcinoma histology. All patients
were evaluable for toxicity and response. Baseline
patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1
There were 23 men (77%) and 7 women (23%), with
a median age of 58 years (range, 33–82 years).
Median ECOG performance status for the population
was 0 (range, 0–2). The median CLIP score was 2
(range, 0–3), and of these 2, 9, 14, and 5 patients had
CLIP scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Eighteen
patients had Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) A disease
and 12 had CTP B disease. Fifteen patients (50%)
had extrahepatic metastasis. Seven patients (23%)
had received 1 previous systemic therapy. Twentyfive patients (83%) had an elevated AFP level at the
time of entry.
Clinical Efficacy
Among all patients, 45 cycles of treatments were
administered. A median of 1 cycle was administered
to each patient (range, 1–3). The median dosage of

cetuximab received per patient was 250 mg/m2
Twenty-four patients (80%) withdrew from therapy
due to disease progression, 1 patient (3%) withdrew
as a result of nontreatment-related toxicity, and 5
patients (17%) withdrew consent during treatment.
All patients came off study and 20 patients had died
at the time of last follow-up. The median follow-up
time was 7.4 months (range, 1–14.6 months).
No patient achieved a complete response (CR) or
partial response (PR). Five patients (17%) had stable
disease (SD) as their best response with a median
duration of 4.2 months (range, 2.8–4.2 months). The
response or progression was based on RECIST criteria and not on AFP levels. No patients were taken off
study based on rising AFP levels alone. However, of
the 25 patients who had baseline elevated AFP levels,
5 patients had decreased AFP levels and 2 patients
had a [50% decrease in AFP levels.
The median overall survival time was 9.6 months
(95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3–12.1 months) and
median PFS time was 1.4 months (95% CI, 1.2–2.6
months) (Fig. 1A and 1B); the PFS rate at 3 months
and 6 months was 23% and 3%, respectively.

Toxicity
Data on toxicity for all 30 patients are provided in
Table 2 The toxicities recorded represent the maximum grade toxicity observed for a given patient for
the entire course of therapy. Cetuximab was generally
well tolerated. There were no treatment-related
deaths or discontinuations. No patients required a
dose reduction. Nine patients had cetuximab withheld during treatment. Nine patients received fewer
than 6 doses of cetuximab and 8 of them had progressive disease before the 6 doses were completed.
No grade 4 treatment-related toxicity was noted
in this study. No infusion reactions were observed.
Grade 3 AST, hypomagnesemia, and fever without
neutropenia were seen in 1 patient (3.3%) each.
Twenty-five patients (83.3%) had grade 1-2 skin rash;
however, no patients developed grade 3 rash. The
incidence of toxicity was similar in patients with normal and impaired hepatic function (data not shown).
EGFR Expression
In this study, patients were required to have tissue
blocks available for EGFR testing but not for initiation of therapy. Of the 30 patients enrolled in the
study, 22 patients had adequate tissue blocks available for IHC testing for EGFR. The rest of the
patients had inadequate tissue materials on further
examination for EGFR testing. Of the 22 patients
with evaluable blocks, 18 (82%) tested positive (10
patients with 31 and 4 patients with 21 positive)

correlation between EGFR expression and clinical
efficacy was observed (data not shown).

Pharmacokinetics Study
Trough (Cmin) serum cetuximab concentrations
were determined from blood samples obtained just
before dosing on Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 in Cycle 1.
Subjects were divided into the following groups:
l) CTP A and CTP B; 2) baseline serum bilirubin
values equal or less than the upper limit of normal

for the subject’s study site (normal) and values
greater than the upper limit of normal (elevated).
Figure 2A shows the mean (SD) cetuximab
trough concentrations versus time for subjects classified as CTP A and CTP B. The total number of subjects with measurable concentrations, and the
subjects from that total for whom there were 5, 4, 3,
2, or 1 week(s) of measurable trough samples available were 17 (11, 2, 2, 1, and 1) and 11 (8, 2, 1, 0,
and 0) for CTP A and CTP B subjects, respectively.
On Week 6 (the time of maximum observed exposure), for the CTP A (n 5 11) and CTP B (n 5 10)
groups, respectively, arithmetic mean serum concentrations were 47.6 mcg/mL and 66.9 mcg/mL, geometric mean concentrations were 40.9 mcg/mL and
57.7 mcg/mL, standard deviations were 26.7 and
32.8, coefficients of variation (percent) were 56.1
and 49.0, median concentrations were 40.9 mcg/mL
and 72.2 mcg/mL, minimum concentrations were
11.0 mcg/mL and 19.3 mcg/mL, and maximum concentrations were 107.0 mcg/mL and 122.0 mcg/mL.

Treatments After Progression on Cetuximab
Due to the short PFS observed, we examined the
subsequent treatment regimens these patients
received upon progression on cetuximab. Fourteen
patients received subsequent treatments, as detailed
in Table 3 Some patients received [1 regimen after
developing disease progression while receiving cetuximab. Five patients were treated on a combination
regimen of gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab based on our earlier phase 2 experience26 and 3
patients had disease control for [4 months. In addition, 3 patients had stable disease for [4 months on
phase 1 studies or other empiric therapies.

DISCUSSION
The prognosis for locally advanced and metastatic
HCC is dismal, with a median survival of \8 months
and the development of an effective systemic therapy
for HCC remains a major challenge. We postulated
that cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that can bind
EGFR and block ligand binding to EGFR, might have
direct anti-HCC activity. Unfortunately, our results
demonstrated lack of antitumor activity of cetuximab
in this population. In this study, no responses were
observed and 80% of patients received only 1 cycle
of treatment due to rapid progression of disease. The
median PFS was only 1.4 months.
Cetuximab proved to be well tolerated in our
study. No grade 4 treatment-related toxicity occurred

and grade 3 toxicity was noted in only 3 patients.
Interestingly, although 25 patients (83.3%) had grade
1-2 skin rash, no patients developed grade 3 rash.
This is likely due to the close observation and aggressive early intervention of rash management. In addition, the short duration of cetuximab treatment most
patients received might be another contributing
factor.
Although cetuximab has not been reported to
undergo hepatic metabolism, the possibility of large
pharmacokinetic perturbations due to hepatic dysfunction could be possible, such as via altered apparent volume of distribution as a result of fluid shifts.
To screen for macroscopic changes in cetuximab
pharmacokinetics, trough drug concentrations values
were collected. The trough is the least variable point
in the dosing interval because it is obtained immediately predose when there has been maximal time for
redistribution. Trough values are routinely used for
the purpose of therapeutic drug monitoring as a
method to screen for large and, therefore, potentially
clinically relevant, pharmacokinetic differences. The
intent of the current study was to screen for such
large deviations and thereby determine whether further study is warranted, rather than to conduct a definitive study of a moderately impaired hepatic
versus a control population powered to discriminate
statistical relevance.
In earlier studies, after administration of an initial dose of 400 mg/m2 and subsequent weekly doses
of 250 mg/m2 in patients, trough concentrations
were reported to approximate steady-state conditions
by the third weekly infusion, with arithmetic mean
trough concentrations across studies ranging from 41
mcg/mL to 85 mcg/mL.27 A population pharmacokinetic analysis was also performed that explored the
potential effects of hepatic function as a covariate.
No impact on the pharmacokinetics of cetuximab
was found.27 In the present study, there appeared to
be a trend toward modestly higher trough serum
concentrations and delayed achievement of steadystate conditions in patients with mild to moderate
hepatic impairment. However, arithmetic mean

trough values between groups were generally close to
or within 1 SD of each other. It is interesting to note
that the arithmetic mean trough concentrations for
patients with hepatic impairment over the 6-week
period studied were similar to those reported earlier
in other patient populations. Therefore, the results of
this study emphasize the general importance of careful monitoring, but do not support a need for routine
cetuximab dosing modifications in patients who
have mild to moderate hepatic impairment. In addition, the results indicate that a larger and more definitive investigation of the influence of moderate
hepatic disease on cetuximab pharmacokinetics is
not likely to be clinically useful. We also failed to
observe any correlation between serum trough concentrations of cetuximab and the incidence of skin
rash and other toxicities.
Multiple strategies to target EGFR signaling pathways have been developed and 2 classes of antiEGFR agents have established clinical activity in cancer: monoclonal antibodies that competitively inhibit
extracellular endogenous ligand binding and small
molecules that inhibit the intracellular TK domain.28,29 The relative benefit of EGFR inhibition by
tyrosine kinase inhibitors as compared with monoclonal antibodies varies in different malignancies.
Table 4 summarizes the current clinical trials of
EGFR inhibitors in HCC. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to use the EGFR-directed
monoclonal antibody in advanced HCC. In contrast
to 2 previous reports with erlotinib,12,13 cetuximab
failed to demonstrate any antitumor activity against
HCC in this study. We did observe an AFP decrease
in 5 patients, with 2 patients having greater than a
50% decrease after cetuximab treatment. However,
given the short duration on treatment and the transient nature of AFP decrease in these patients, it is
difficult to assess the significance of AFP decrease in
our study. Further studies are needed to define the
AFP response and to assess if AFP decrease correlates
with improved clinical outcome in HCC patients on
treatment. Lapatinib, a selective dual inhibitor of
both EGFR and HER-2/NEU tyrosine kinases, also

demonstrated modest activity in HCC in a preliminary report.30 Evidence from other tumor types suggests that different classes of EGFR inhibitors may
have different antitumor activity. Although both
EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors and EGFR-directed
monoclonal antibodies appear to have single-agent
activity in advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer,31–34
single-agent activity in metastatic colorectal cancer
appears largely restricted to antibody therapy.17,18
The lack of activity of cetuximab in HCC in the current study raises additional unanswered questions
regarding the role of EGFR inhibition in HCC. Do
other monoclonal antibodies against EGFR have any
potential activity in advanced HCC? Does combined
EGFR blockade with both cetuximab or other monoclonal antibodies and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have additive or synergistic antitumor activity in
HCC? Does cetuximab have improved efficacy when
combined with chemotherapy? It is worth noting
that EGFR exon 18-21 mutations have not been identified in HCC.35 Although dose escalation of cetuximab based on rash has been explored in other tumor
types, the aggressive nature of HCC and the lack of
any activity of cetuximab seen in our study would
make this strategy difficult. Therefore, the definitive
benefits of any EGFR inhibitors in HCC and the optimal combination, if any, require further studies. As
an initial attempt to test the optimized cetuximab
based treatment regimens in vitro, Huether et al.20
demonstrated that cetuximab inhibited growth of
p53 wild-type HepG2 HCC cells in a time- and dosedependent manner. In this study, cetuximab treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest in the G1/G0 phase.
Combining cetuximab with erlotinib or doxorubicin
resulted in synergistic antiproliferative effects in
these HCC cells.
We observed very short PFS (1.4 months) and
relatively long overall survival (9.6 months) in our
study. Although we could not fully interpret this discrepancy, 2 potential reasons might account for this.
First, some of the patients on study may have relatively indolent disease. This is reflected by the fact
that 47% of patients received additional treatments
upon progression on cetuximab. Second, some of
these patients may have received clinical benefits
from additional treatment upon progression on
cetuximab. In our study, 6 patients had disease control for more than 4 months from additional lines of
therapy. Our study also reflects the limitation and
controversy over the use of primary endpoints in
HCC phase 2 study design. Although overall survival
should be considered the primary endpoint in phase
3 studies, it may be less informative in small phase 2
studies due to the heterogeneity of the disease and

patient selection bias. Using response criteria suffers
from the inherent difficulty of consistently imaging
HCC lesions and the variable pattern of HCC growth.
In addition, molecularly targeted agents like cetuximab may be cytostatic instead of cytotoxic. PFS has
the advantage of assessing overall tumor-modifying
effects of a particular agent/regimen and may be
most informative in HCC phase 2 studies. Unfortunately, PFS is dependant on using RECIST criteria to
evaluate progression and, as outlined above, this is
often problematic for HCC due to the difficulties in
obtaining directly comparable images. To demonstrate the disease-modifying effects of cytostatic
agents, it would be desirable to know the natural history of the study cohort and documented disease
progression before study entry. In our study only 7
patients had prior systemic therapy, making it difficult to assess if cetuximab truly has tumor-modifying
effects. Future HCC trials should consider the use of
a randomized phase 2 design to assess the potential
disease-modifying effects of investigational agents.
In conclusion, the results of the current study
demonstrated a lack of antitumor activity of cetuximab in patients with advanced HCC in this phase 2
study. Cetuximab could be safely administered with
tolerable safety profiles in this population. Cetuximab trough concentrations were not found to be
notably altered in patients with mild to moderate
hepatic dysfunction. Given the preclinical data for
cetuximab activity and preliminary efficacy of other
anti-EGFR agents against HCC, further studies are
warranted to assess the role of cetuximab when combined with other targeted agents or chemotherapy in
advanced HCC.
