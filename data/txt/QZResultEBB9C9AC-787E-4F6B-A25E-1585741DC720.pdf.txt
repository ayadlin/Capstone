Abstract
Autofluorescence spectroscopy is a powerful imaging technique that exploits endogenous fluorophores. The
endogenous fluorophores NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) are two of the principal electron donors and acceptors in cellular metabolism, respectively. The optical oxidation-reduction (redox) ratio is a measure of cellular metabolism and can be determined by the ratio of NADH/FAD. We hypothesized that there
would be a significant difference in the optical redox ratio of normal mammary epithelial cells compared with
breast tumor cell lines and that estrogen receptor (ER)–positive cells would have a higher redox ratio than
ER-negative cells. To test our hypothesis, the optical redox ratio was determined by collecting the fluorescence
emission for NADH and FAD via confocal microscopy. We observed a statistically significant increase in the
optical redox ratio of cancer compared with normal cell lines (P < 0.05). Additionally, we observed a statistically significant increase in the optical redox ratio of ER(+) breast cancer cell lines. The level of ESR1 expression, determined by real-time PCR, directly correlated with the optical redox ratio (Pearson's correlation
coefficient = 0.8122, P = 0.0024). Furthermore, treatment with tamoxifen and ICI 182,870 statistically decreased
the optical redox ratio of only ER(+) breast cancer cell lines. The results of this study raise the important
possibility that fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to identify subtypes of breast cancer based on receptor
status, monitor response to therapy, or potentially predict response to therapy. This source of optical contrast
could be a potentially useful tool for drug screening in preclinical models. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4759–66. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Fluorescence microscopy is a useful tool to characterize
the metabolic properties of normal and cancerous cells and
tissue (1, 2). The primary oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions in cells to generate energy in the form of ATP are the
conversion of NAD+ to its reduced form NAD(P)H (henceforth referred to as NADH) and the oxidation of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to FADH2 , a process known as
oxidative phosphorylation. Both NADH and FAD are autofluorescent and have distinct excitation and emission maxima. The optical redox ratio can be determined by calculating
the ratio of the measured fluorescence intensities of NADH
and FAD (NADH/FAD; ref. 3).
Alterations in cellular metabolism are an important hallmark of carcinogenesis (4). Cancer cell metabolism is often
shifted from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis
as the primary generator of cellular ATP. Although the exact

mechanisms for the switch to aerobic glycolysis and altered
cellular metabolism are variable and complex (4, 5), it presents clear advantages for tumor growth. These advantages
include resistance to fluctuations in the local oxygen concentration (6) and alterations in the tumor microenvironment
that support tumor cell migration and invasion (7, 8). This
shift, which gives rise to enhanced production of lactate in
the presence of high oxygen, has long been known as the
“Warburg effect” (9). In aerobic glycolysis, glucose is metabolized into two pyruvate molecules, which are then converted into lactate. This results in the production of two
molecules of ATP and two NADH. During oxidative phosphorylation, one molecule of glucose is converted to carbon
dioxide and water, resulting in the production of 30 to
36 ATP molecules and the oxidation of 10 NADH molecules
to NAD+. Thus, the switch from oxidative phosphorylation to
aerobic glycolysis results in a net increase in NADH.
Estrogens and estrogen receptors (ER) have been shown to
play a role in numerous aspects of cellular metabolism in a
number of organ systems, including the liver, pancreas, brain,
muscle, and breast (10, 11). Estrogens/ER have been shown
to increase glucose transport and glycolysis (12–15). For example, estrogen exposure has been shown to increase the
expression of a number of glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins (12, 15, 16). Estrogen (but not the ER antagonist tamoxifen) increased glucose uptake and lactate production in
MCF-7 xenografts as measured by C13 nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (13). Additionally, estrogens/ER regulate

gene expression of proteins involved in the citric acid cycle
and oxidative phosphorylation (10). Although not specifically
studied in the breast, estrogen/ER have been shown to regulate citrate synthase, aconitase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase
(17–20). Notably, isocitrate dehydrogense activity results in
the reduction of NAD+ to NADH, which is expected to cause
an increase in the optical redox ratio. Furthermore, ER has
been shown to localize to the mitochondria in a variety of
cell types (10), and it has been proposed that mitochondrial
localization of ER is important for the transcriptional regulation of numerous mitochondrial DNA–encoded genes.
Previous studies have shown that the optical redox ratio is
statistically different between cancer and normal epithelial
cells, with cancer cells exhibiting higher redox ratios (2, 3,
21, 22). For example, in a study comparing normal keratinocytes to human papillomavirus (HPV)–transformed cells, the
authors found that HPV-transformed cells had a higher overall intensity of NADH and a lower overall intensity of FAD,
which resulted in a statistically significant difference in the
optical redox ratio (22). However, the optical redox ratio of
NADH to FAD has not been quantified for different biological
subtypes of breast cancer, nor has its relationship to breast
cancer ER status been assessed.
Based on previously published reports in the literature, our
primary hypotheses tested in this study were that the optical
redox ratio can differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant breast cells and between ER(+) and ER(−) breast cancer cell lines. A secondary hypothesis is that the optical redox
ratio can specifically monitor response to antiestrogen therapies. To test our hypotheses, we determined the optical redox
ratio using a confocal microscopy approach. NADH and FAD
intensities were acquired from a panel of normal mammary
epithelial and breast cancer cell lines following excitation at
351 and 488 nm, respectively. The optical redox ratio differentiated normal mammary epithelial cells from breast cancer
cells and also stratified breast cancer cell lines based on ER
expression, which was associated with an increased optical
redox ratio. Further, treatment of ER(+) breast cancer cell
lines with antiestrogens resulted in a decrease in the optical
redox ratio. This effect was not observed in ER(−) cell lines.
ER has proved to be a successful target of antitumor therapy in ER(+) breast tumors. However, resistance to antiestrogen therapies is a serious clinical problem for the treatment
of breast cancer. Whereas ER expression is a good predictor
of response to antiestrogen therapies, not all ER(+) tumors
respond to therapy and some develop resistance after initially
responding to therapy. Therefore, the optical redox ratio may
serve as an important biomarker to differentially identify ER
(+) breast cancers and monitor response to antiestrogen therapy, with applications in drug discovery and screening as well
as clinical assessment of response to antiestrogen therapies.

Duke Cell Culture Facility. Primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were obtained from Lonza and transduced
with a retrovirus encoding human telomerase catalytic subunit (hTERT). Cells that incorporated hTERT were selected
with puromycin and resistant cells were pooled and used
for subsequent experiments. All cell lines except MCF-10A
and HMEC were cultured in minimal essential medium α
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum,
10 mmol/L HEPES (Invitrogen), 1× nonessential amino acids
(Invitrogen), 1× sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 1 μg/mL insulin (Invitrogen), 1 μg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma Aldrich),
and 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma Aldrich).
MCF-10A and HMEC were cultured in MEBM (Lonza) containing insulin, EGF, hydrocortisone, and bovine pituitary
extract. All cell lines were tested for Mycoplasma contamination at the time of purchase and all experiments were done
within 6 months of purchasing cell lines.
Confocal microscopy
For all experiments testing the optical redox ratio, cells
were plated at 1 × 10 5 per 35-mm glass-bottomed dish
(MatTek Corporation). For the panel of normal mammary
epithelial cells and breast cancer cell lines, cell images were
obtained approximately 48 hours later on a Zeiss LSM 410
confocal microscope (Duke University Light Microscopy Core
Facility). NADH intensity images were obtained by excitation
at 351 nm with a Coherent Enterprise II UV laser and the
emission collected with a 400-nm LP filter. FAD intensity
images were obtained by excitation at 488 nm with an
Omnichrome KrAr laser and the emission collected with a
505-nm LP filter. Settings for NADH were gain = 9,611, offset =
411, and for FAD, gain = 9,555, offset = 490; the pinhole was
set at 1,488 μm for both NADH and FAD. The pinhole, gain,
and offset remained the same for every experiment. A model
cell line, MCF-10A, was imaged during each experiment to
confirm that the laser power and instrument settings were
comparable from day to day (internal control). For cells treated with the antiestrogens tamoxifen (Tam) or ICI 182,780
(ICI; Sigma Aldrich), cells were plated as described above,
and then approximately 24 hours later, cells were treated
with 2 μmol/L Tam, 100 nmol/L ICI, or vehicle control
(ethanol or DMSO). Images were acquired approximately
48 hours following treatment. Each cell line was imaged on
at least 2 separate days. For each imaging session, there were
two plates of each cell line and two fields of view (320 μm ×
320 μm) for both NADH and FAD. All images were acquired
with a 40× oil objective. Each image was line averaged
16 times, and image acquisition took approximately
16 seconds. Following data collection, the NADH/FAD ratio
(a measure of the reduction-oxidation ratio) was calculated
for every cell in each image. For each acquired NADH and
FAD image, ImageJ software (NIH, ref. 23) was used to obtain
the integrated intensity of NADH and FAD for each cell in the
image after the background fluorescence was subtracted.
NADH values were divided by the FAD value for each cell
in an image and the average NADH/FAD was calculated for
the entire image (n = 1). All images (n ≥ 8) were then averaged to determine the optical redox ratio.

To test for ESR1 expression, total RNA from normal
mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cell lines
(two independent cultures from each cell line) was isolated
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. On-column DNase digestions were

done to eliminate any genomic DNA contamination using
the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen). Total RNA quantity
and quality were determined using the NanoDrop ND-1,000
full-spectrum UV/Vis spectrophotometer V3.1.2. All of the
RNA that was used in this study had a 260:280 ratio between
2.1 and 2.2. RNA integrity was analyzed using the Experion
RNA HighSens Analysis Kit (Bio-Rad), which confirmed the

presence of intact 18S and 28S rRNA. First-strand cDNA
was synthesized from total RNA using the SuperScript III
First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
cDNA was amplified using the QuantiTect SYBR Green
PCR master mix (Qiagen) on a Bio-Rad iCycler MyiQ
Single-Color Real-time PCR Detection System. ESR1 amplification conditions were 95°C for 15 minutes, followed by
40 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 58°C for 30 seconds, and
72°C for 30 seconds. 18S amplification conditions were identical except for an annealing temperature of 53°C. ESR1 primer sequences were generated using VectorNTI software
(Invitrogen): ESR1-F, 5′-CAGCTGTCGCCTTTCCTGCA-3′;
ESR1-R, 5′-CACCCTGGCGTCGATTATCT-3′; 18S primers
were purchased from Qiagen (QT00199367). Temperature
gradients were performed to ensure that the annealing temperature for each gene was optimal. Melting curve analysis
was done at the end of the PCR reaction to confirm that only
one amplified product was detected. PCR amplification data
were analyzed with the MyiQ Optical System Software version 1.0 (Bio-Rad). The baseline cycles and threshold were
automatically calculated by the software. Because the standards were defined for each of the experimental runs, the
software adjusted the threshold to attain the highest possible
correlation coefficient value for the PCR standard curve.
Quantitative RT-PCR was done at least twice on each cDNA
from two independent RNA samples from each cell line.
Cell cycle analysis
To confirm that Tam treatment of MCF-7 cells resulted in
cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, MCF-7 cells were plated at
2.5 × 105 per well in a six-well plate. Twenty-four hours after
plating cells, triplicate wells were treated in with 2 μmol/L
Tam or vehicle control for 48 hours. Cells were collected

following trypsinization, washed twice with 1× PBS, and then
fixed in 75% ethanol overnight. Before staining, ethanol-fixed
cells were washed twice with 1× PBS. Samples were then
incubated in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) staining buffer containing 1× PBS, 1 mg/mL RNase A, 0.5 μmol/L
EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 100 μg/mL propidium iodide
before FACS cell cycle analysis. Each experiment was repeated at least twice.

Results
Optical redox ratio differentiates breast cancer from
normal cell lines
A number of previous reports suggested that the optical
redox ratio (NADH/FAD) could be used to differentiate
breast cancer cell lines from normal mammary epithelial
cells (24, 25). To further test this hypothesis, we examined
a panel of nine breast cancer cell lines and two cell line models of normal mammary epithelial cells. As described in Materials and Methods, each cell line was imaged on at least
2 separate days, two plates per cell line and two images
per plate, for a minimum n = 8 (Table 1). MCF-10A cells, a
model of normal mammary epithelial cells, were imaged each
day and had a very consistent redox ratio with a small SE.
Qualitatively, NADH intensity was lower and FAD intensity
was higher in normal mammary epithelial cells compared
with ER(−) and ER(+) breast cancer cell lines. As shown
in Fig. 1A, the NADH intensity dramatically increased in ER(+)
BT-474 and MCF-7 cells compared with HMEC, MDA-231,
and MDA-468 cells, and FAD intensity decreased in MDA231, MDA-468, BT-474, and MCF-7 cells compared with
HMEC. Furthermore, when the NADH images were divided
pixel by pixel by the FAD images, there was a dramatic increase in the NADH/FAD signal in ER(+) BT-474 and MCF-7

cells compared with HMEC, MDA-231, and MDA-468 cells
(Fig. 1B).
Following ImageJ analysis, all data for each cell line were
averaged, and the results are shown in Fig. 2A. We found that
the optical redox ratios of MCF-10A and HMEC lines, models
of normal mammary epithelial cells, were not statistically different from each other (Student's t test, P > 0.05), but both
MCF10A and HMEC lines had statistically different optical
redox ratios when compared individually to all cancer cell
lines (Student's test, P < 0.05). Additionally, all of the ER(+)
cells had higher optical redox ratios relative to all of the ER
(−) breast cancer cell lines. A Tukey-Kramer test was done to
account for multiple comparisons and unequal group sizes
and indicated that ER(−) and ER(+) cell lines were significantly different when data were grouped as normal mammary epithelial cells, ER(−), or ER(+).
Optical redox ratio correlates with ESR1 expression
The results from the data presented in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that the optical redox ratio is associated with ER expression in the breast cancer cell lines. Therefore, the ER mRNA
(ESR1) expression levels were tested by quantitative RT-PCR
to determine the association between ESR1 expression and
the optical redox ratio. Total RNA was harvested from each
cell line and cDNA was prepared. Quantitative RT-PCR was
then performed with primers specific to ESR1 and 18S. All
ESR1 data were normalized to 18S. As shown in Fig. 3A, very
low expression of ESR1 was observed in both normal mammary epithelial cell lines and all four breast cancer cell lines
previously reported to be ER(−), whereas all five breast cancer cell lines previously reported as ER(+) expressed significant amounts of ESR1. Interestingly, we observed low ESR1
expression in MDA-468 and BT-20 breast cancer cell lines.
These two ER(−) breast cancer cell lines had statistically significant higher redox ratios than the other two ER(−) breast

cancer cell lines (MDA-231 and MDA-435; Student's t test,
P < 0.05). To determine if ESR1 expression positively correlated
with the optical redox ratio, a Pearson's correlation test was
performed. We found that ESR1 expression and the optical
redox ratio were positively correlated (Pearson's correlation
coefficient = 0.8122, P = 0.0024), further suggesting that ER
expression has an effect on the optical redox ratio.
Antiestrogens modulate the optical redox ratio
Because ER expression positively correlated with the optical redox ratio, the next logical step was to test the effects of
the antiestrogens Tam and ICI on the optical redox ratio.
First, the effects of Tam treatment were tested by cell cycle
analysis. Tam (2 μmol/L) or vehicle control was added to the
normal growth medium of triplicate cultures of MCF-7 for 48
hours. MCF-7 cells were then trypsinized and fixed in 75%
ethanol overnight. Samples were then stained with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry for cell cycle
distribution. After 48 hours of Tam treatment, there was a
statistically significant increase in MCF-7 cells with sub-G1
content of DNA (3.6% to 7.0%; P < 0.0001), indicative of apoptosis, an increase in cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle
(53% to 64%; P = 0.0007), and a decrease in cells in S-phase
and G2-M (S-phase: 25% to 17%, P = 0.0007; G2-M: 19% to
13%, P = 0.0017) as shown in Fig. 4A. The cell cycle analysis
indicated that 2 μmol/L Tam has a significant effect on the
proliferation and cell cycle distribution of MCF-7 cells. Similar results were also obtained for MCF-7 cells treated with
100 nmol/L ICI (data not shown).
To test for Tam-induced changes in the optical redox ratio,
ER(+) MCF-7 and T47D cells were treated for 48 hours with
2 μmol/L Tam or vehicle control, and NADH and FAD autofluorescence were measured as described above. Tam treatment resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the
optical redox ratio in both MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer

cell lines (Student's t test, P < 0.05; Fig. 4B). Next, the effects
of Tam and ICI on ER(+) MCF-7 and ER(−) MDA-231 cells
were tested. The underlying hypothesis was that if the optical
redox ratio is dependent on ER signaling, then the optical
redox ratio of MCF-7 cells treated with Tam or ICI would decrease. However, the optical redox ratio of ER(−) MDA-231
cells would remain unchanged. Indeed, both Tam and ICI
had a statistically significant effect on the optical redox ratio
of MCF-7 cells (Student's t test, P < 0.05), but not MDA-231
breast cancer cells, as shown in Fig. 4C.
An MCF-7 variant cell line, LCC9, was also acquired from
Robert Clarke at Georgetown University (26). The LCC9 cells
are ER(+) but resistant to Tam and ICI. Parental MCF-7 and
LCC9 cells were treated with either vehicle control or 100
nmol/L ICI for 48 hours. ICI-treated parental MCF-7 cells
had a statistically significant lower optical redox ratio compared with vehicle control–treated MCF-7 cells (Student's
t test, P < 0.05), whereas the optical redox ratio of LCC9 cells
was not significantly affected by ICI treatment (Fig. 4D). Together, the data in Fig. 4 suggest that ER antagonists reduce
the optical redox ratio in ER(+) breast cancer cells, but not in
ER(−) or antiestrogen-resistant cell lines.

Discussion
Our study shows that the optical redox ratio (a) differentiates normal mammary epithelial cells from a panel of breast
cancer cell lines (Fig. 2), (b) positively correlates with ER expression (Fig. 3), and (c) can be used to monitor response to
antiestrogen therapy (Fig. 4).

This is the first study to examine the optical redox ratio in
a panel of cell lines that includes both normal mammary epithelial cells and ER(+) and ER(−) breast cancer cell lines.
Similar to our findings (Fig. 1A), a number of studies have
found that NADH intensity is higher in cancer cells and
high-grade dysplasia compared with normal tissue or cell
lines (24, 25, 27). In a study of 35 suspected cervical lesions
and 7 cases of Barrett's esophagus, higher NADH fluorescence
was observed in high-grade dysplastic lesions compared with
nondysplastic tissue (27). Another study, which compared
one breast cancer cell line and one normal mammary epithelial cell line, found that NADH intensity was 1.8-fold higher in
the breast cancer cell line (25). Interestingly, a third study
found that whereas breast cancer tissue had elevated NADH
compared with normal tissue, the opposite was true for oral
cancers (24), suggesting that transformation-induced changes
in the optical redox ratio may be specific to organ site.
Contrary to the results presented here, in a previous study
by our group, NADH and FAD intensities were examined independently in MCF-10A, T47D, MDA-231, and in control
and R-Ras transformed cell lines (28). This study used fluorescence spectroscopy of cell suspensions, and a statistically
significant difference in NADH or FAD intensity between malignant and nonmalignant cells was not observed. One explanation for the differences in findings between our current
monolayer and previous cell suspension studies is likely
due to the fact that fluorescence intensity of cells in suspension is prone to random error not present in monolayer studies. Specifically, the effects of scattering from cell suspended
in media can randomly attenuate or increase the fluorescence. Further, whereas NADH and FAD intensity values

provide a measure of the metabolic state, the ratio of NADH
and FAD is a more robust measurement in that it provides
an internal control for cell density and instrument throughput variations.
The effect of ER expression on the optical redox ratio is
not surprising. As stated above, estrogens and ERs have been
shown to play a role in numerous aspects of cellular metabolism (10). The results presented here further indicate the
importance of estrogen/ER in cancer cell metabolism. Based
on previous reports (12–15), the dramatic increase in the
optical redox ratio is likely due to an increase in glucose
transport and aerobic glycolysis, which results in an increase
in NADH. Considering the plethora of metabolic pathways
estrogens/ERs have been shown to participate in, this is likely not the whole story. Future cell culture studies may provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying
estrogen/ER–induced effects on the optical redox ratio.
Although our study is the first to demonstrate that the optical redox ratio can be used to monitor response to antiestrogen therapy, our results are consistent with a previous study
which showed that the optical redox ratio is modulated in response to the chemoprevention agent N-4-(hydroxyphenol)retinamide (4HPR) in bladder and ovarian cancer cell lines
(21). In the study by Kirkpatrick and colleagues, fluorescence
spectroscopy was used to measure NADH and FAD intensities.
Samples were excited from 270 to 700 nm to generate excitation-emission matrices from cells in suspension. NADH intensity was calculated from the excitation at 350 nm with emission
wavelengths 445 to 455 nm. FAD intensity was calculated from
the excitation at 450 nm with emission wavelengths 530 to
540 nm. This study, which measured the optical redox ratio as
FAD/(FAD+NADH), showed a dose-dependent increase in the
optical redox ratio of cells treated with 4HPR, which correlated
with a significant decrease in NADH intensity. Furthermore,
cell lines that exhibited a greater response to 4HPR, as assessed
by cell cycle analysis, also showed an increase in the optical redox ratio. Together, our studies suggest that the optical redox
ratio is a good biomarker to differentially identify ER(+) breast
cancer cells and to monitor response to antiestrogen therapies.
Additional studies in cell lines will allow us to further test the

mechanism of ER-induced effects on the optical redox ratio. A
better understanding of how ER regulates cellular metabolism
may lead to additional targets for more effective therapies and
for prevention of resistance to antiestrogens.
If, as our data suggest, ER has a profound effect on the
optical redox ratio, our cell line data should be recapitulated
in mouse models in vivo. We have already begun to implement fiber-optic based fluorescence spectroscopy to measure
optical redox ratios in small animal models. In a recent
study, we noninvasively measured hemoglobin saturation
and the optical redox ratio in response to carbogen breathing
in a mouse tumor model (29). Quantitative optical spectroscopy measurements of hemoglobin saturation were consistent with invasive measurements of pO2 using an OxyLite
partial oxygen pressure sensor, suggesting that noninvasive
optical techniques have the potential to reliably measure
changes in tumor physiology. Importantly, in individual
animals there was a strong linear correlation between hemoglobin saturation and the redox ratio following the administration of carbogen, reflecting the expected relationship
between redox ratio and hemoglobin saturation (oxygen
demand and supply). In conclusion, optical technologies
are available to measure the optical redox ratio as well as
other relevant parameters, such as hemoglobin oxygenation,
in vivo. Thus, this parameter, which has been shown to have
significance in our cell study, can be translated to measurements in small animal models and ultimately in patients.
