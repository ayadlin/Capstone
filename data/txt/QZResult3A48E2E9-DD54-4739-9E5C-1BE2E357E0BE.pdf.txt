ABSTRACT:
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains an incurable malignancy, urging for
the identification of new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. CLL cells rely
on overexpression and hyperactivation of the ubiquitous serine/threonine protein
kinase CK2 for their viability in vitro. CIGB-300 is a cell-permeable selective CK2
inhibitor peptide undergoing clinical trials for several cancers. Here, we show that
CIGB-300 promotes activation of the tumor suppressor PTEN and abrogates PI3Kmediated downstream signaling in CLL cells. In accordance, CIGB-300 decreases the
viability and proliferation of CLL cell lines, promotes apoptosis of primary leukemia
cells and displays antitumor efficacy in a xenograft mouse model of human CLL. Our
studies provide pre-clinical support for the testing and possible inclusion of CK2
inhibitors in the clinical arsenal against CLL.

INTRODUCTION

stimulated the quest for new classes of CK2 antagonists
[17] and drove the development of CK2 inhibitors for
clinical application in cancer [18, 19]. CIGB-300 is a cellpermeable peptide that modulates CK2 activity by binding
to the phosphoacceptor site on CK2 targets [18]. CIGB300 demonstrated a dose-dependent antiproliferative and
proapoptotic effect in a variety of tumor cells [20]. In
vivo, both local and systemic administration of CIGB-300
elicited significant antitumor effects in murine syngeneic
cancers and human tumors xenografted in nude mice [21].
Most importantly, phase I clinical trials in cervical cancer
showed tumor reduction, and CIGB-300 was safe and well
tolerated [22].
In the studies reported here, we used for the first
time CIGB-300 to pre-clinically evaluate the potential of
CK2 inhibition in CLL treatment.

Despite significant improvements in treatment
outcome in recent years [1, 2], chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) – the most common leukemia in the
Western world – remains incurable [3, 4]. In addition,
a significant fraction of patients does not tolerate the
aggressive protocols that may prolong overall survival
[5]. Thus, further understanding of CLL biology and
pathophysiology are mandatory for the identification of
new molecular targets and the development of rational,
more efficient therapies against this malignancy.
The ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase CK2
is frequently overexpressed in cancer, including several
hematological neoplasms [6-10]. Recently, we and others
have shown that leukemia cells from CLL patients display
higher CK2 expression and activity than normal B cells,
leading to inhibition of PTEN and activation of PI3K
signaling pathway [9, 10], which is required for CLL cell
survival [11-13].

commonly rely on CK2 for their maintenance [14-16]

downregulated S380 PTEN phosphorylation, particularly
in the MO1043 CLL cell line (Figure 1A) and also, albeit
to a lesser extent, in primary CLL cells (Figure 1B).
Decreased PTEN phospho-S380 is a reliable indicator of
augmented PTEN lipid phosphatase activity [8, 25] and
consequent decrease in PI3K signaling pathway activation.
Accordingly, phosphorylation of PI3K downstream targets
Akt/PKB and GSK-3β decreased after treatment with
CIGB-300 (Figure 1A,B).

CIGB-300 activates PTEN and inhibits PI3K
signaling pathway in CLL cells
Based on previous data showing that PI3K-mediated
signals are required for survival of CLL cells in vitro [11,
13, 23], and that CK2 positively regulates PI3K pathway in
CLL [9-11], we started by evaluating the impact of CIGB300 on the interplay between CK2 and PI3K signaling.
First, we confirmed that the peptide efficiently prevented
phosphorylation of the direct CK2 target residue S129
on Akt/PKB (which leads to increased catalytic activity
of already activated Akt) [24] in the MO1043 CLL cell
line (Figure 1A) and in primary CLL cells (Figure 1B).
Then, in accordance with results of other CK2 inhibitors,
we found that incubation of CLL cells with CIGB-300

CIGB-300 decreases the viability and proliferation
of CLL cells and overcomes stromal support
Next, we sought to evaluate whether these molecular
observations translated into functional impact on CLL
cell viability and proliferation. The CLL cell lines MEC1,
WaC3CD5, JVM3 and MO1043 were cultured with
increasing concentrations of CIGB-300 and cytotoxicity
was analyzed at 72h by Alamar blue assay. The IC50 of
CIGB-300 on these cells ranged between 27 and 38µM,
which is comparable to that of solid tumor cell lines
displaying sensitivity to the inhibitor in vivo [18] (Figure
2A). A more detailed analysis revealed that both viability
and proliferation of CLL cell lines decreased in a time(not shown) and dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B,C
and data not shown). The dose- and time-dependent
impact of CIGB-300 extended to primary CLL samples
collected from the peripheral blood of patients (Fig. 3A).
Notably, 12.5µM CIGB-300 were sufficient to induce a
dramatic decrease in viability in all CLL patient samples
analyzed, even in poor prognosis cases such as those
with 11q deletion (Fig. 3B and Table 1). To better define
the therapeutic potential of the drug, we next assessed
whether the effect of CIGB-300 on primary CLL cells is
counteracted by stromal support. Culture with the murine
stromal cell line OP9 enhanced the viability of primary
CLL cells, as expected, but it did not reverse the proapoptotic effect of CIGB-300 in any of the CLL samples
analyzed (Figure 3C).

CIGB-300 delays CLL growth in vivo

DISCUSSION

To further evaluate the clinical potential of CIGB300, we xenotransplanted MO1043 cells subcutaneously
into nude mice as described in the ‘Methods’. CIGB300-treated mice presented a significant delay in tumor
growth compared with the control group. The difference
between groups was evident after approximately 1 week
of treatment and became more significant with time
(P<0.001, two-way ANOVA, Figure 4). Importantly, none
of the mice showed weight loss or other toxicity-related
symptoms throughout the experiment (not shown). These
results suggest that targeting CK2 using CIGB-300 may be
a valid therapeutic strategy in CLL.

We and others previously showed that CK2 is a
critical regulator of CLL cell viability [9-11]. However,
those studies were conducted either after silencing of
CK2 or using drugs that are not appropriate for in vivo
administration [9-11] and therefore have limited clinical
relevance. By contrast, in the present studies we explored
for the first time the pre-clinical value of CIGB-300, a
CK2 inhibitor that has already undergone clinical trials
for other cancers and has demonstrated to be safe when
used at clinically effective concentrations, with only mild
to moderate toxicities [20].
We showed that treatment with CIGB-300 inhibited
the viability and proliferation of CLL cell lines with

4945 [28], constitute strong evidence for the therapeutic
potential of CK2 inhibition in the context of CLL and pave
the way towards the clinical evaluation of these and other
CK2 antagonists in this malignancy.

METHODS
Patient samples.
Peripheral blood (PB) samples from CLL patients
were collected in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki after informed consent and ethical approval of
Instituto Português de Oncologia (Lisbon, Portugal). Table
1 summarizes the clinical and biological characteristics
of the patients analyzed. CLL cells were isolated from
PB using RosetteSep human B cell enrichment cocktail
(StemCell Technologies) as indicated by the manufacturer.
The purity of CLL cells was always higher than 90%, as
evaluated by staining with anti-CD5, CD3 and CD19
fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (eBioscience)
followed by flow cytometry analysis using a FACSCanto
cytometer (Becton Dickinson).

Figure 4: CK2 inhibition with CIGB-300 delays tumor
growth in a subcutaneous CLL mouse model. Previously
irradiated Swiss nude mice were injected subcutaneously in the
right flank with 5 x 106 MO1043 cells. Three days after cell
injection, mice were randomly distributed in 2 groups (n=6 per
group): vehicle (control) and CIGB-300 (20mg/Kg, ip, 5 days +
2 days rest, every week, for 3 weeks). Tumor volume determined
after treatment started. Statistical differences were evaluated
using a two-way ANOVA test. * P<0.05 and ***P<0.001.

IC50 values that are within a clinically suitable range.
Moreover, CIGB-300 promoted apoptosis in all the
primary CLL samples we analyzed, in a dose and timedependent manner. Although anecdotal, it is noteworthy
that this effect was evident even in one CLL case that
presented del11q, which associates with poor prognosis
and resistance to chemotherapy [26, 27]. Importantly,
we also noted that stromal support by OP9 cells did not
confer resistance against CK2 inhibition to primary CLL
cells. These observations are in line with the in vivo
effects of CIGB-300, which showed a clear delay in tumor
development. Whether combination of CK2 inhibitors may
synergize with novel targeted therapies [4] and contribute
to the eradication of CLL is an exciting possibility that
warrants further investigation.
Primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [8] and
CLL [9] cells display high levels of phosphorylation of
PTEN (indicative of PTEN posttranslational inactivation)
mediated by CK2. We found that CIGB-300 promoted
PTEN activation and decreased the phosphorylation of Akt,
a major PI3K downstream target. This notwithstanding,
it should be underlined that PI3K signaling abrogation
is probably just one of the mechanisms, albeit of critical
importance, by which inhibition of CK2, a pleiotropic
kinase that regulates numerous functions, may contribute
to apoptosis of CLL cells. In fact, the pleiotropy of CK2
may be a fundamental cause for the addiction to CK2
activity displayed by tumor cells, and it is a key reason
why, given the observations that CK2 inhibition does not
result in intolerable side-effects, CK2 is a very promising
therapeutic target in the context of cancer in general and
CLL in particular.
In summary, our current data using CIGB-300,
together with our parallel study demonstrating the preclinical efficacy of the CK2 small molecule inhibitor CXwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cell culture and viability analysis.
CLL cells were cultured as described [9, 28], and
treated with CIGB-300 where specified. Viability was
determined by flow cytometry after staining with Annexin
V-APC (eBioscience) and 7-AAD (Becton Dickinson) [9].
Cytotoxicity was determined using AlamarBlue assay.
Briefly, cell lines were seeded in flat bottom 96-wells
plates under the culture conditions described above
and indicated concentrations of CIGB-300 were added.
Following 3 days of incubation with CIGB-300, Alamar
Blue (Life Technologies) was added to cell cultures in
an amount equal to 10% of the culture volume. Cells
were further incubated at 37ºC, 5% CO2 for 2-4 hours.
Fluorescence was measured at wavelengths of 530nm
excitation and 580nm emission in an Infinite M200 plate
reader (Tecan).

In vivo experiments.
Eight week-old swiss nude mice, full-body irradiated
with 600cGy the day before, were injected subcutaneously
in the right flank with 5x106 MO1043 cells resuspended
in 100µL of 50% Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) in PBS. At
day 3, all mice presented palpable tumors (100-150mm3)
and were randomly assigned into two groups (n=6 per
group) to receive CIGB-300 intraperitoneal (ip) at 20 mg/
kg or vehicle, once a day, for 5 consecutive days every
week, for a total of 3 weeks. Mice were monitored daily
and weighed frequently to determine possible treatment261

induced toxicities. Tumors were measured every other
day with a caliper and tumor volume was calculated
(volume = length x width2 /2). Mice were sacrificed when
tumor reached 1500mm3. Housing and treatment was in
accordance with EU guidelines and institutional ethics
committee approval.
