BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of antineoplastic therapy on dental development
and saliva function in recipients of childhood antineoplastic therapy. METHODS: Patients attending the long-term follow-up clinic at Children’s Hospital at Westmead, NSW, Australia, were included if they had received treatment prior
to 16 years of age and were in remission for more than 5 years. A dental examination and saliva test were performed
for each participant. Holtta’s Defect Index (HDI) was used to assess tooth aplasia, microdontia, and root-crown ratio
on an orthopantomogram (OPG). Multivariable-adjusted regression analyses were used to estimate the association of
patient characteristics and treatment modalities with dental outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred six participants (61%
male) were recruited (response rate ¼ 88%). The mean HDI score was 24.7  17.8. A cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide >7500 mg/m2 increased the HDI score by 13.06 (P ¼ .01). Recipients of cyclophosphamide also had significantly increased odds of exhibiting very low saliva flow (<0.7 mL/min) (odds ratio ¼ 12.43; 95% confidence interval,
2.08-74.35; P ¼ .006). CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents who received high doses of cyclophosphamide were
at increased risk of dental disturbances. Cyclophosphamide recipients were also at greater risk of exhibiting very low
saliva flow. This study applied the HDI to patients receiving all forms of antineoplastic treatment and highlights the
dose-dependent relation between cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide and dental disturbances. Cancer 2011;117:

The overall survival rates of childhood and adolescent cancer have increased to 75% since the advent of modern antineoplastic therapy in the 1970s.1 Well-established long-term effects of antineoplastic treatment include dental disturbances
such as microdontia,2 atypical root formation,3,4 and tooth aplasia.5-14 Other effects include hyposalivation,15-17 dental
immaturity and disturbances in dental eruption, as well as trismus and osteoradionecrosis.18 However, it is difficult to attribute these effects to any single agent or treatment modality, as multimodal therapy is employed in almost all childhood
cancers.4
The use of certain chemotherapeutic agents, including the immunosuppressant cyclophosphamide, has been
expanded to treat benign conditions in children such as nephrotic syndrome,19 juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,20 and systemic lupus erythematosus.21 Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating nitrogen-mustard derivative capable of cross-linking
intra- and interstrand DNA and DNA proteins, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and inducing apoptosis.22 Adverse
effects of cyclophosphamide such as haemorrhagic cystitis, cardiomyopathy, and hepatic veno-occlusion are well known,
although the biologic mechanisms behind such effects are not completely understood.22 However, few clinical studies
have been conducted to examine the impact of specific chemotherapeutic agents on oral health outcomes in children.23,24
In our cohort of patients, we assessed the effect of antineoplastic therapy on dental development and salivary gland

function in a cohort of recipients of childhood antineoplastic therapy. The current study focuses on the
association of chemotherapeutic agents, particularly
cyclophosphamide, with dental development and saliva
function.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
All patients who attended the Long-Term Follow-up
Clinic at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead, NSW,
Australia, between September 2007 and April 2009 were
considered for inclusion in the study. Exclusion criteria
were diagnosis with any condition that may have affected
dental development or saliva function before antineoplastic therapy; diagnosis with any condition characterized by
dental defects and/or saliva dysfunction; or unwillingness
or inability to cooperate for dental examination, radiography, or saliva testing. Of the 121 participants contacted
over the 2-year recruitment period, 106 participants
(treated between 1988 and 2003) were enrolled in the
study (response rate ¼ 88%). Informed consent was
obtained from each participant and/or guardian. Ethical
approval for the project was obtained from the Children’s
Hospital at Westmead Human Research Ethics Committee (ethics approval number: 2007/065).
Clinical Assessment for Dental Caries and
Salivary Gland Function
A single examiner (S.G.H.) conducted detailed oral health
assessments on all participants. The intraoral soft tissues
and periodontium were examined visually for any abnormalities. Each tooth was dried using compressed air and
examined for dental caries using a mouth mirror. Teeth
with a frank cavity, undermined enamel, or a softened
floor or wall were recorded as carious, according to the
1997 World Health Organization guidelines.25 The
patients’ dental caries scores were recorded using the
decayed, missing, and filled tooth (DMFT/dmft) index
separately for primary and permanent teeth.26
Saliva testing was performed first to prevent additional saliva gland stimulation. Stimulated whole saliva
was collected while the patient chewed on a piece of paraffin wax for 5 minutes. The flow rate of stimulated whole
saliva was categorized as very low (<0.7 mL/min), low
(0.7-1.0 mL/min), or average (1.0 mL/min). In adults, a
paraffin-stimulated flow rate <0.7 mL is considered
hyposalivation.27 The buffering capacity of stimulated
whole saliva was measured using commercial test strips

2220

(Saliva-CheckV kit, GC, Tokyo, Japan). The interaction
between saliva and the acid-impregnated pH-indicator
test strips resulted in color changes indicative of the buffering capacity, which was categorized into 3 groups: very
low, low, or normal.
R

Holtta’s Defect Index
Holtta’s Defect Index (HDI) was used to assess overall
disturbances in dental development for each patient.7 The
HDI was developed in 2002 by Holtta et al7 to assess
dental defects in recipients of childhood bone marrow
transplantation (BMT). The method uses an orthopantomogram (OPG) to assess each tooth systematically, and
expresses, using a single figure, the total defects of the
permanent dentition. The HDI comprises 3 components:
tooth aplasia, microdontia, and root/crown ratios.
In the current study, an OPG was taken for each
R
patient using the OrthophosV XG Plus Ceph (Sirona,
Bensheim, Germany) unit at the Oral Imaging Department, Children’s Hospital, under supervision of the
primary author (S.G.H.). OPGs were printed on photo
paper (Everyday Picture Paper, Kodak, Rochester, NY),
and compared against the original radiograph to ensure
no distortion had occurred during printing. A tooth was
deemed missing if a second premolar or molar was not
visible on the OPG by age 6 years (the development of
incisors and canines begins 5 to 6 months in utero). Third
molars were excluded due to the great variability in morphology and presence in the general population.
Tooth dimensions were measured in millimeters on
printed OPGs using a clear plastic ruler (least count 1
mm). A tooth was labeled microdontic if the crown width
was less than half of that of a tooth of the same type in the
contralateral quadrant (for example, a first molar could be
compared with a first or second molar). For any tooth
with a closed apex, the root/crown ratio was determined
by dividing root length over crown height. A tooth was labeled not determined if it was poorly visible or had open
apices. Figure 1 shows the typical appearance of microdontia, tooth aplasia, and root shortening in OPGs as
observed in this study. Once each tooth on an OPG had
been labeled, it was assigned defect points based on the severity of the defect. An individual tooth may be assigned
points ranging from 1 to 5 (Table 1). The most severe
defect, tooth aplasia, was assigned 5 points. The least
severe defect was a root/crown ratio ranging from 1.2 to
1.6, which was assigned 1 defect point. The defect points
for each tooth were added to give the total HDI score for
that individual. A total HDI score of 0 indicated a healthy

Statistical Analysis
The distribution of each variable was examined to identify
extreme data points. Bivariate comparisons were undertaken to examine participant characteristics within categories of HDI scores and 2-sided P-values <.05 were
considered statistically significant. Multivariable-adjusted
regression models were estimated to study the association
of different variables with the outcomes of interest. The
main predictor variables of interest were sex (males vs
females), age at start of treatment (years), treatment modality (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy), cyclophosphamide dose (0, >0 to <7500, 7500 mg/m2),
doxorubicin dose (0, >0 to <300, 300 mg/m2), actinomycin-D (no vs yes), and vincristine (no vs yes). The association of vinblastine exposure with dental development
could not be investigated in detail as only 5 patients had
been exposed to this drug. The study also considered the
effect of diagnosis (leukemia vs solid tumors), but this
variable was not a significant predictor and did not affect
the association between chemotherapeutic agents and oral
health parameters, so it was excluded from the final
model. The main outcome variables that were the focus of
this study included HDI scores (continuous variable),
occurrence of microdontia or tooth aplasia (yes vs no),
and whole saliva flow (<3.5, 3.5 to 5 or >5 mL), buffering capacity (very low, low, or normal), and DMFT scores
(treated as a dichotomous outcome; 0 vs 1 DMFT). For
intra-examiner reliability, the HDI scores of 20 patients
were reassessed 2 weeks after the initial assessment by the
same examiner (S.G.H.). Kappa statistic for intra-examiner reliability for determining HDI scores was greater

than 80% for all components of the HDI. All statistical
analysis was performed in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Participant characteristics are detailed in Table 2 and
Figure 2. The mean ( standard deviation [SD]) age of
the participants at enrollment was 15.8 (5.1) years and
that at commencement of antineoplastic therapy was 4.9
(3.6) years. A majority of participants were male (61%).
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Wilms tumor
were the most common neoplasms for which treatment
was given. The most common non-neoplastic conditions
included aplastic anemia and sideroblastic anemia.
Participants received varying combinations of radiotherapy, surgery, and hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT). All received chemotherapy with the
exception of 1 child. Of the participants, 28% of children
underwent HPCT, 38% received some form of radiotherapy, and 10% had surgery. A majority of children received
intravenous cyclophosphamide with 22% receiving a dose
of 7500 mg/m2 or higher. Approximately half the children received doxorubicin with 16% receiving higher
doses (300 mg/m2).
HDI Scores, Microdontia, and Tooth Aplasia
It was possible to calculate HDI scores for 100 of the 106
participants. Scores could not be obtained for the other 6
participants because they were either unable to cooperate
or declined to have radiographs taken. The mean (SD)
HDI score of the participants was 24.7 (17.8), with a
range of 0 to 74.
Age at the start of treatment and treatment that
included total body irradiation (TBI), head and neck irradiation, and HCPT were significant predictors of HDI

scores (data presented elsewhere). The distribution of
HDI scores within different categories of cyclophosphamide cumulative dose is shown in Figure 3. HDI scores
increased with greater doses of cyclophosphamide, and
participants receiving 7500 mg/m2 or more had significantly higher HDI scores than patients not receiving this

2222

drug. This association persisted in multivariable-adjusted
linear regression models that adjusted for participant characteristics, age at start of treatment, and other therapies
received (Table 3). On average, participants who had
received 7500 mg/m2 or more cyclophosphamide experienced an increase of approximately 13 points in HDI
score when compared with those who had not used this
drug (P ¼ .01). Other chemotherapeutic agents including
doxorubicin, actinomycin-D, vinblastine, and vincristine
were not associated with HDI scores. The final linear
regression model predicted 61.9% (R2 ¼ 0.619; P <
.0001) of the variation in HDI scores.
To further elucidate the observed association
between cyclophosphamide use and HDI scores, separate
multivariate models were estimated for each component
of the HDI index (root-crown ratio, tooth aplasia, and
microdontia). The proportion of teeth with root-crown
ratio below normal (1.6) was 21% higher in those taking
any dosage of cyclophosphamide when compared with
those who had not taken this drug (P ¼ .02). Similarly,
the odds ratio for having microdontia was 3.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73-14.99; P ¼ .12) and for tooth
aplasia was 7.80 (95% CI, 0.90-67.80; P ¼ .06) in
patients on this drug when compared with those who
were not administered cyclophosphamide. However, this
finding was statistically insignificant.
Salivary Gland Function and Dental Caries
Stimulated whole saliva was collected for 104 participants;
the remaining 2 children were unable to cooperate. Low
saliva flow (0.7-1.0 mL/min) was prevalent in 18.3% (n
¼ 19) of the participants, and very low saliva flow (<0.7
mL/min) was prevalent in 27.9% (n ¼ 29). Prevalence of
low and very low saliva flow rates did not vary significantly with sex or age at the start of treatment. In the total
body irradiation group, the highest proportion of children
(37.5%) had very low salivary flow rates. Average salivary
flow rates were most prevalent in children who did not
receive irradiation (60.9%). In a multivariable-adjusted
logistic regression analysis, participants who had received
cyclophosphamide had 12.4 times the odds of having very
low salivary flow in contrast to those who had not taken
this drug (95% CI, 2.08-74.35; P ¼ .006) (Table 4).
Other chemotherapeutic drugs were not significantly
associated with salivary flow. Cyclophosphamide use was
not significantly associated with salivary buffering
capacity or dental caries scores. In fact, no substantial
differences were observed in the DMFT scores between
participants and an age-matched Australian cohort (data

observed between the DMFT scores and any treatment
variable.

DISCUSSION
Our results highlight the potentially adverse effects of cyclophosphamide use on dental development and saliva
production in recipients of childhood antineoplastic therapy. In 100 patients, cumulative cyclophosphamide doses
of 7500 mg/m2 or more were significantly associated with
increased severity of dental developmental defects, measCancer

ured using a previously validated index. This finding is
consistent with that of the Childhood Cancer Survivor
study by Kaste et al, which found that individuals who
received high cumulative doses of alkylating agents were
more likely to self-report a dental abnormality.23 In the
current study, recipients of cyclophosphamide also had
significantly increased odds of having very low saliva flow.
Furthermore, younger age at the start of treatment,
HPCT, TBI, and head and neck irradiation were also significantly associated with increased dental disturbances.
These findings were consistent with previous studies.5-13
Dental development is a complex and prolonged
process. The development of permanent teeth is initiated
between 5 months in utero and 9 months postnatally
(excluding third molars), and the initial calcification process (excluding third molars) occurs between 3 months
and 3 years of age and continues until coronal development is complete around 8 years of age.29 The end of dental development is marked by the completion of root
formation, which occurs on average at 16 years of age for
second molars.29 Hence, there is a prolonged window of
susceptibility when crown and root development is
subject to many external influences such as irradiation and
internal influences including chemotherapy.30 Furthermore, teeth do not remodel and hence serve as permanent
records of disturbances during development; however, the
first signs of defects may not be observed until 1 to 2 years

after treatment due to the protracted nature of
odontogenesis.31
Tooth formation arises as a result of reciprocal interactions between the stomadeal ectoderm and neural crestderived mesenchyme. A number of critical signalling
pathways direct these interactions and any disturbance
may result in dental defects. Several animal models and in
vitro studies have demonstrated dose-dependent dental
disturbances caused by cyclophosphamide, primarily on
the continually growing rat incisor.32-42 Cyclophosphamide administered in growing rats resulted in shortened
roots and reduced crown size of molars. It was shown that
the roots of the rat molars rarely reached two-thirds of the
normal root length, accompanied by closure of root apices.35 It was suggested that cyclophosphamide induced
root shortening by disturbing the cells in Hertwig’s root
sheath and that early apical closure occurred due to formation of osteodentin.36
Clinical demonstrations of the dental effects of cyclophosphamide (or chemotherapy alone) are scarce.24 In

phosphamide and busulfan, short roots and microdontia
were reported.44 The total duration of treatment was 10
days, and no other chemotherapeutic agents were given.
In the current study, children who received cyclophosphamide doses of 7500 mg/m2 or more had an increase in
HDI scores of 13 points (P ¼ .01). This increase is equivalent to an individual having at least 2 missing teeth or 3
microdontic teeth. Other agents demonstrated in animal
models to cause dental defects are doxorubicin,43,45-47
vinblastine,5 and vincristine,5,39 but this was not observed
in our study.
Participants exposed to cyclophosphamide showed
reduced saliva flow in the current study. Although there
are few studies on the long-term effects of antineoplastic
therapy on the salivary flow of children, studies of adult
patients show that both stimulated and unstimulated saliva flow decrease during chemotherapy.48 Salivary flow is
reduced in adults by chemotherapeutic agents cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, bleomycin, methotrexate, doxorubicin, and vinblastine.49-52 However, chemotherapy
appears to cause less acute damage alone than in combination with cranial irradiation or total body irradiation.16,53,54 It has also been suggested that the
administration of anticholinergic anti-emetics during
early phases of chemotherapy may also reduce salivary
flow.48 Autopsies on adult recipients of doxorubicin and

cyclophosphamide showed histopathologic changes, such
as ductal dilatation, cyst formation, acinar degeneration,
and infiltration in inflammatory cells in salivary gland tissue,48 which may, at least partly, explain the findings
observed in our participants.
The effect on salivary flow after cessation of chemotherapy is not well known. A study that included 12 children who had HPCT and high-dose chemotherapy
reported that whole saliva flow decreased from 0.8 mL/
min to 0.6 mL/min 3 months after treatment. Flow rates
increased to baseline level 12 months after treatment.15
However, the results of our study showed that recipients
of cyclophosphamide had 12.4 times the odds (95% CI,
2.08-74.35; P ¼ .006) of having very low salivary flow of
less than 0.07 mL/min 5 or more years after the completion of antineoplastic treatment. It is difficult to compare
the results of this study with previous studies, due to variations in population sample, inclusion criteria (eg, time in
remission), and definition of low stimulated saliva flow.
There are currently no recognized figures for low stimulated saliva flow in children. A factor that may also contribute to low saliva flow in this study population is
prolonged immunodeficiency from medications such as
steroids and chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD).
However, Dahllof et al reported similar salivary secretion
rates of children diagnosed with cGVHD compared with
those without cGVHD.15
Despite the observed association of cyclophosphamide exposure with low stimulated saliva flow, no significant association could be demonstrated with an increased
DMFT score. Reports on the correlation between caries
prevalence and chemotherapy exposure in other studies
have been inconsistent.24,55 It is possible that participants
attending our long-term follow-up clinic, particularly
those who received cyclophosphamide and/or HPCT,
were generally a more carefully monitored group of
patients due to their increased risk of developing other
conditions. Therefore, this group of patients were more
likely to receive appropriate dental education and early
intervention, thus minimizing the risk of dental caries. In
cases where low stimulated saliva flow is associated with
patient discomfort (eg, during chewing or swallowing),
salivary substitutes may be beneficial.
The limitations of the current study include the
measurement of dental development and salivary gland
function at one point in time. Salivary protein concentrations were not measured, which would have allowed a
more comprehensive assessment of salivary gland function. Although we adjusted for other covariates in our sta-

tistical analysis, including age at start of treatment and
other chemotherapeutic agents, unmeasured or mismeasured confounders may affect the association of cyclophosphamide with HDI and salivary flow. We classified a
tooth as being microdontic based on comparisons with a
contralateral tooth. Although this may introduce bias if
the comparator tooth was also microdontic (leading us to
misclassify an affected tooth as normal), it would only
lead to an underestimation of the association between cyclophosphamide and HDI scores. The current study is
amongst the largest studies on the topic and is strengthened by the use of detailed clinical and radiographic
measurements. The use of a validated index of dental developmental defects (the HDI) allows the results presented here to be compared with other studies. It may
have been beneficial to modify the parameters used in the
HDI for an Australian population, however, such data are
currently not available.
Overall, the results presented will contribute to the
evidence base for clinicians assessing and/or treating the
increasing numbers of survivors of childhood antineoplastic therapy. Further prospective studies in children receiving cyclophosphamide as well as investigations into the
biologic mechanisms behind this agent’s effects on dental
development and saliva function are required.
