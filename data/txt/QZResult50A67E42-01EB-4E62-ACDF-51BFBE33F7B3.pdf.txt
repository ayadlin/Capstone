Abstract
Gastroesophageal reflux disease complicated by Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a major risk factor for esophageal
adenocarcinoma (EA). However, the mechanisms of the progression from BE to EA are not fully understood.
Besides acid reflux, bile acid reflux may also play an important role in the progression from BE to EA. In this
study, we examined the role of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and a novel NADPH oxidase NOX5-S in bile acid–induced increase in cell proliferation. We found that taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA)
significantly increased NOX5-S expression, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, and cell proliferation in EA
cells. The TDCA-induced increase in cell proliferation was significantly reduced by U73122, an inhibitor of PIPLC. PI-PLCβ1, PI-PLCβ3, PI-PLCβ4, PI-PLCγ1, and PI-PLCγ2, but not PI-PLCβ2 and PI-PLCδ1, were detectable
in FLO cells by Western blot analysis. Knockdown of PI-PLCγ2 or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2
mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase with small interfering RNAs (siRNA) significantly decreased TDCAinduced NOX5-S expression, H2O2 production, and cell proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of PI-PLCβ1,
PI-PLCβ3, PI-PLCβ4, PI-PLCγ1, or ERK1 MAP kinase had no significant effect. TDCA significantly increased
ERK2 phosphorylation, an increase that was reduced by U73122 or PI-PLCγ2 siRNA. We conclude that TDCAinduced increase in NOX5-S expression and cell proliferation may depend on sequential activation of PI-PLCγ2
and ERK2 MAP kinase in EA cells. It is possible that bile acid reflux present in patients with BE may increase
reactive oxygen species production and cell proliferation via activation of PI-PLCγ2, ERK2 MAP kinase, and
NADPH oxidase NOX5-S, thereby contributing to the development of EA. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1247–55. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) has increased by more than 6-fold in the past 3 decades (1). Gastroesophageal reflux disease complicated by Barrett's
esophagus (BE) is a major risk factor for EA (2). The mechanisms of the progression from BE to EA are not known. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play an important role in the
development of EA because levels of ROS are increased in BE
(3) and EA (4, 5). ROS may cause damage to DNA, RNA, lipids, and proteins, which may result in increased mutation

and altered functions of enzyme and proteins (e.g., activation
of oncogene products and/or inhibition of tumor suppressor
proteins; refs. 4, 6). However, the sources of ROS in these conditions have not been well defined.
Low levels of ROS, seen in nonphagocytic cells, were
thought to be byproducts of aerobic metabolism. More recently, however, superoxide-generating homologues of
phagocytic NADPH oxidase catalytic subunit gp91 phox
(NOX1, NOX3–NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2) and homologues
of other subunits (p41phox or NOXO1 and p51phox or NOXA1)
have been found in several cell types (7, 8), suggesting that
ROS generated in these cells may have distinctive cellular
functions related to immunity, signal transduction, and modification of the extracellular matrix. NOX5 has five isoforms:
α, β, δ, γ, and NOX5-S (9, 10). NOX5 α, β, δ, and γ have EFhand motifs at its NH2 terminus (9), whereas NOX5-S does
not (11). We have shown that the NADPH oxidase isoform
NOX5-S is present in EA FLO cells (12) and that levels of
NOX5-S are significantly increased in Barrett's esophageal
mucosa with high-grade dysplasia (13).
Bile acids may also play an important role in the progression from BE to EA (14, 15) because (a) in animal models
diversion of duodenal contents into the lower esophagus
leads to EA (16, 17), (b) bile acids are known to induce oxidative stress and DNA damage (18, 19), (c) bile salts may induce upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 and c-myc expression

(20, 21) and activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase
and NF-κB pathways (22, 23), thereby increasing cell proliferation and decreasing cell apoptosis. However, mechanisms
whereby bile acids promote the development of EA are not
known.
We have shown that bile acid taurodeoxycholic acid
(TDCA)–induced upregulation of NOX5-S expression and increase in cell proliferation depend on activation of TGR5 receptor (a bile acid receptor) and Gαq protein in EA cells (12).
Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) has
been reported to be activated by the Gαq protein family
(24, 25). Gαq proteins are involved in TDCA-induced
NOX5-S expression and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Whether PI-PLC plays a role in TDCA-induced NOX5
expression, H2O2 production, and cell proliferation has not
been established. We now show that TDCA-induced increase
in cell proliferation and upregulation of NOX5-S expression is
mediated by activation of PI-PLCγ2 and extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) 2 MAP kinase in EA cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and TDCA treatment. Human EA cell line
FLO was derived from human EA (26) and generously provided by Dr. David Beer in 2004 (University of Michigan Medical
School, Ann Arbor, MI). FLO cells matched the genotype of
the progenitor tumor cells from the patient's tumor tissue
block. Cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37°C with 5% CO2 humidified
atmosphere.
Human EA cell line OE33 was cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The cell lines
were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.
For TDCA treatment, FLO cells were incubated with 10−11
mol/L TDCA for 24 h. For use of inhibitors, cells were pretreated with U73122 (10−6 mol/L), PD98059 (10−5 mol/L), or
culture medium (control) for 1 h and cultured in fresh medium (pH 7.2; without phenol red) without TDCA and inhibitors (control), with TDCA (10−11 mol/L), or with TDCA and
the above inhibitors for an additional 24 h. Finally, the culture medium and cells were collected for measurements.
Small interfering RNA and plasmid transfection. Twentyfour hours before transfection at 70% to 80% confluence, cells
were trypsinized and diluted 1:5 with fresh medium without
antibiotics (1–3 × 105/mL) and transferred to 12-well plates
(1 mL/well). Transfection of small interfering RNAs (siRNA)
was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Per well, 75 pmol of
siRNA duplex of PI-PLCγ1, PI-PLCγ2, PI-PLCβ1, PI-PLCβ3,
PI-PLCβ4, ERK1, ERK2, or control siRNA formulated into
liposomes were applied; the final volume was 1.2 mL/well.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with
or without TDCA in culture medium (pH 7.2; without phenol
red) for 24 h, and then the culture medium and cells were
collected for measurements. Transfection efficiencies were
determined by fluorescence microscopy after transfection
of BLOCK-iT fluorescent oligonucleotide (Invitrogen) and
were ∼70% at 48 h.

Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted
by Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) for the cultured cells and purified by the total RNA purification system (Invitrogen). According to the protocols of the manufacturers, 1.5 μg of
total RNAs from cultured cells were reversely transcribed
by using a SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen).
Quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time
PCR was carried out on a Stratagene Mx4000 multiplex
quantitative PCR system. The primers used were as
follows: NOX5-S, 5′-AAGACTCCATCACGGGGCTGCA-3′
(sense) 5′-CCTTCAGCACCTTGGCCAGA-3′ (antisense);
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH),
5′-CATGACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′AGGTCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (antisense). All reactions were performed in triplicate in a 25 μL total volume
containing a 1× concentration of Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR
Master Mix (Stratagene), and the concentration of each sense
and antisense primer was 100 nmol/L, 1 μL cDNA, and 30
nmol/L reference dyes. Reactions were carried out in a Stratagene Mx4000 multiplex quantitative PCR system for 1 cycle at
94°C for 5 min; 40 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 59°C for 30 s, and 72°C
for 30 s; 1 cycle at 94°C for 1 min; and 1 cycle at 55°C for 30 s.
Fluorescence values of SYBR Green I dye, representing the
amount of product amplified at that point in the reaction,
were recorded in real time at both the annealing step and
the extension step of each cycle. The Ct, defined as the point
at which the fluorescence signal was statistically significant
above background, was calculated for each amplicon in each
experimental sample using Stratagene Mx4000 software. This
value was then used to determine the relative amount of
amplification in each sample by interpolating from the standard curve. The transcript level of each specific gene was
normalized to GAPDH amplification.
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer. The suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5
min, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was
determined. Western blot was done as described previously
(27). Briefly, after these supernatants were subjected to SDSPAGE, the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 1 h. The
nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk
and then incubated with appropriate primary antibodies
followed by 60-min incubation in horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences).
Detection was achieved with an enhanced chemiluminescence agent (Amersham Biosciences).
Primary antibodies used were as follows: PI-PLCγ1 and PIPLCγ2 antibody (1:1,000), PI-PLCβ1 antibody (1:1,000), PIPLCβ3 and PI-PLCβ4 antibody (1:1,000), phospho–MAP
kinase antibody (1:1,000), ERK2 antibody (1:1,000), and
GAPDH antibody (1:2,000). NOX5 antibody was prepared
against a mixture of unique NOX5 peptides (NH 2 -YESFKASDPLGRG‐SKRC-COOH and NH 2 -YRHQKRKHTCPSCOOH) and used at a dilution of 1:1,000.

Figure 1. Effect of U73122 on
TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression.
A, a typical example of Western
blot analysis and summarized data
showed that PI-PLC inhibitor
U73122 significantly decreased
TDCA-induced NOX5-S protein
expression. B, U73122 significantly
reduced TDCA-induced H2O2
production. C, U73122 significantly
reduced TDCA-induced thymidine
incorporation. The data suggest that
TDCA-induced increase in NOX5-S
expression, H2O2 production, and
cell proliferation may depend on
activation of PI-PLC. D, a typical
example of Western blot analysis of
three experiments showed that
PI-PLCβ1, PI-PLCβ3, PI-PLCβ4,
PI-PLCγ1, and PI-PLCγ2, but not
PI-PLCβ2 or PI-PLCδ1, were
detectable in human EA cells FLO.
For TDCA treatment, FLO cells were
pretreated with U73122 (10−6 mol/L)
or culture medium (control) for 1
h and then treated with TDCA
(10−11 mol/L) or TDCA + U73122 for
24 h. The culture medium was

PI-PLCβ4, ERK1, ERK2, or control, cells were treated with or
without TDCA for 24 h and then incubated with [methyl-3H]
thymidine (0.05 μCi/mL) for 4 h. After washing thrice with
PBS to remove unincorporated radioactivity, cells were collected and homogenized with a lysis buffer containing (pH 7.4) 50
mmol/L HEPES, 50 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% NP40,
0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1
mmol/L DTT. [Methyl-3H]thymidine uptake was measured in
a scintillation counter. The level of protein in the homogenates
was also determined, and the level of [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation was normalized to protein content.
Amplex Red H2O2 fluorescent assay. Levels of H2O2 in culture medium were determined by using the Amplex Red
H2O2 assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc.). This assay uses the
Amplex Red reagent (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine) to
detect H2O2. In the presence of peroxidase, the Amplex Red
reagent reacts with H2O2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce
the red fluorescent oxidation product resorufin. Fluorescence
is then measured with a fluorescence microplate reader using excitation at 550 nm and emission detection at 590 nm.
Protein measurement. The amount of protein was determined by colorimetric analysis (Bio-Rad) according to the
method of Bradford (28).

Results
PI-PLC involved in TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression
in FLO cells. In this study, we found that low dose of TDCA
(10−11 mol/L, 24 hours) caused 4-fold increase in NOX5-S

Figure 2. Role of PI-PLCγ2 in TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression. A, a typical example of Western blot analysis and summarized data showed that
transfection with PI-PLCγ2 siRNA significantly decreased PI-PLCγ2 protein expression in FLO EA cells, indicating that PI-PLCγ2 siRNA effectively knocked
down PI-PLCγ2 protein expression (n = 3). B, a typical example of Western blot analysis and summarized data showed that knockdown of PI-PLCγ2
protein significantly decreased TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression. C, knockdown of PI-PLCγ2 protein significantly decreased TDCA-induced H2O2
production. D, knockdown of PI-PLCγ2 protein significantly decreased TDCA-induced thymidine incorporation in both FLO and OE33 cells. The data
suggest that PI-PLCγ2 protein may contribute to TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression, H2O2 production, and cell proliferation in EA cells. Transfection of
siRNA was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000. Per well, 75 pmol of siRNA duplex of PI-PLCγ2 or control siRNA formulated into liposomes were applied.
After a 4-h transfection, the transfection medium was replaced with regular medium. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with low
dose of TDCA for 24 h, and then culture medium and cells were collected for measurements (n = 3). *, P < 0.02, ANOVA, compared with control group

increase in cell proliferation in FLO cells when compared
with control (Fig. 1A–C). These changes were statistically significant. We also found that the PI-PLC inhibitor U73122 (29)
decreased TDCA-induced NOX5-S protein expression from
395.1 ± 87.1% to 135.1 ± 11.3% control (P < 0.02; Fig. 1A),
H2O2 production from 155.1 ± 3.5% to 63.2 ± 1.9% control
(P < 0.001; Fig. 1B), and thymidine incorporation from
202.4 ± 38.0% to 127.7 ± 13.2% control (P < 0.02; Fig. 1C) in
FLO cells. These data suggest that PI-PLC may be involved
in TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression and H2O2 production
in FLO cells.
Seven major PI-PLC isoforms have been identified thus far
(30). To further determine which PI-PLC isoforms mediate
TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression, we used Western blot
analysis to examine which PI-PLC isoforms are present in
FLO cells. Isoforms of PI-PLC (β1, β3, β4, γ1, and γ2, but
not β2 and δ1) were detectable in FLO cells (Fig. 1D). To examine whether these isoforms of PI-PLC regulate TDCAinduced NOX5-S in FLO cells, we used PI-PLCβ1, PI-PLCβ3,
PI-PLCβ4, PI-PLCγ1, and PI-PLCγ2 siRNA to knock down expression of these proteins. PI-PLCγ2 siRNA significantly decreased its protein expression (Fig. 2A) 48 hours after
transfection. Knockdown of PI-PLCγ2 protein expression
with PLCγ2 siRNA decreased TDCA-induced NOX5-S expres-

sion from 339.7 ± 50.2% to 136.7 ± 32.4% control (P < 0.001;
Fig. 2B), H2O2 production from 131.5 ± 2.6% to 106.7 ± 9.7%
control (P < 0.001; Fig. 2C), and thymidine incorporation
from 162.5 ± 19.4% to 103.6 ± 8.8% control (P < 0.001; Fig. 2D)
in FLO cells. Knockdown of PI-PLCγ2 protein also remarkably
decreased TDCA-induced cell proliferation in OE33 EA cells
(Fig. 2D). However, knockdown of PI-PLCβ1, PI-PLCβ3, PIPLCβ4, or PI-PLCγ1 protein expression did not affect
TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression (Supplementary Figs. S1
and S2). The data suggest that TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression may depend on activation of PI-PLCγ2 protein, but not
PI-PLCβ1, PI-PLCβ3, PI-PLCβ4, or PI-PLCγ1 protein.
Role of ERK MAP kinases in TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression. Activation of PI-PLC produces inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol has been shown to
activate the protein kinase C–MAP kinase pathway (31).
Therefore, we examined whether ERK MAP kinases mediate
TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression. The MAP kinase kinase
inhibitor PD98059 (32) decreased TDCA-induced NOX5-S
mRNA expression from 131.4 ± 3.9% to 59.8 ± 7.6% control
(P < 0.001; Fig. 3A), H 2 O 2 production from 155.1 ± 3.5%
to 71.1 ± 5.2% control (P < 0.001; Fig. 3B), and thymidine
incorporation from 202.9 ± 33.7% to 135.6 ± 16.4% control
(P < 0.01; Fig. 3C), indicating that TDCA-induced increase

We used ERK1 and ERK2 siRNA to knock down ERK1 and
ERK2 expression, respectively. ERK1 and ERK2 siRNA signifi-

Figure 5. Role of ERK1 MAP kinase in TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression. A, a typical example of Western blot analysis and summarized data showed that
transfection with ERK1 MAP kinase siRNA significantly decreased ERK1 protein expression in FLO EA cells, indicating that ERK1 siRNA effectively
knocked down ERK1 protein expression. B, a typical example of Western blot analysis and summarized data showed that knockdown of ERK1 MAP kinase
protein did not significantly affect TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression. The data suggest that TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression may not be mediated
by activation of ERK1 in FLO EA cells. Transfection of siRNA was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000. Per well, 75 pmol of siRNA duplex of ERK1 or control

1.7% control (P < 0.05; Fig. 4C), and thymidine incorporation
from 173.8 ± 7.4% to 103.7 ± 2.9% control (Fig. 4D) in FLO cells.
Knockdown of ERK2 protein expression with ERK2 siRNA also
significantly decreased thymidine incorporation in response to
TDCA treatment in OE33 cells. Conversely, knockdown of
ERK1 protein expression had no statistically significant effect
on NOX5-S expression induced by TDCA stimulation (Fig. 5B).
The data suggest that TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression, H2O2
production, and cell proliferation may be mediated by activation of ERK2 MAP kinases, but not ERK1.
To further confirm the role of ERK2 MAP kinases, we examined ERK2 phosphorylation in FLO cells. We found that
TDCA significantly increased ERK2 phosphorylation by 4.5fold (Fig. 6A), indicating that ERK2 may be activated by
TDCA in FLO cells. In addition, TDCA-induced ERK2 phosphorylation was significantly reduced by U73122 (Fig. 6A),
suggesting that activation of ERK2 may depend on activation
of PI-PLC. Knockdown of PI-PLCγ2 expression significantly
decreased TDCA-induced ERK2 phosphorylation from 571 ±
167.9% to 179.3 ± 67.9% control (P < 0.05; Fig. 6B). The data
suggest that TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression may depend
on sequential activation of PI-PLCγ2 and ERK2 MAP kinase.

Discussion
Bile acids have been shown to contribute to the development of EA in a rat model of BE (17). Therefore, we examined
whether bile acids upregulate NOX5-S expression and increase ROS production, thereby increasing cell proliferation
and contributing to the development of EA. Bile acids, a
group of structurally diverse molecules that are primarily
synthesized in the liver, are the major components of bile.
Besides their well-established roles in dietary lipid absorption and cholesterol homeostasis, it has recently emerged
that bile acids are also signaling molecules in cell metabolism and signal transduction (33, 34). TDCA has been reported to be one of the major bile acids in the refluxate of
patients with BE (35) and is more toxic than primary bile
acids; thus, we used TDCA in our studies. Although reflux
episodes are usually in terms of minutes or hours, particularly in long-segment BE and in the supine position, percent total time pH <4 ranges from 10.0 to 46.0 in BE patients (35);
that is, esophageal mucosa is exposed to the refluxate for 2.4
to 11.0 hours per day. It is possible that low concentration of
bile acids is present in the mucus layer that covers the surface of metaplastic cells for a much longer time after reflux

episodes. In addition, it has been reported that short-term
bile acid treatment does not alter cell proliferation in BART cells (36). Therefore, 24-hour treatment with TDCA was
used in our studies. The concentrations of bile acids in micromolar range are commonly found in the refluxate of BE
patients (35), but metaplastic cells may be exposed to a much
lower concentrations of bile acids due to the mucus layer
that covers the surface of these cells. This notion is implicated by an in vivo study showing that the interstitial pH is conserved in normal rat esophagus when luminal pH is reduced
to 1.0 (37). In addition, we have previously shown that 10−11
mol/L TDCA, but not higher doses, increases cell proliferation (12). Therefore, 10−11 mol/L TDCA was used in the
present study. We found that TDCA increased NOX5-S expression, H2O2 production, and cell proliferation.
The mechanisms of bile acid–induced increase in cell proliferation are poorly understood. We have found that TDCAinduced increase in NOX5-S expression and cell proliferation
is mediated by activation of the TGR5 receptor and Gαq protein in FLO EA cells (12). It has been reported that Gαq protein family may activate PI-PLC (24, 25). Because Gαq
proteins are involved in TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression
and H2O2 production, we examined the role of PI-PLC in bile
acid–induced NOX5-S expression in FLO cells. Based on comparison of the sequences and structural studies, PI-PLC has
three kinds of eukaryotic isozymes: PI-PLCβ, PI-PLCγ, and

PI-PLCδ (30, 38). We found that TDCA-induced increase in
NOX5-S expression and H2O2 production may depend on activation of PI-PLCγ2 protein because (a) TDCA-induced increase in NOX5-S expression and H2 O 2 production was
significantly reduced by the PI-PLC inhibitor U73122; (b)
knockdown of PI-PLCγ2 protein significantly reduced
NOX5-S expression, H2O2 production, and cell proliferation
in response to TDCA treatment in FLO and/or OE33 cells;
(c) knockdown of PI-PLCβ1, PI-PLCβ3, PI-PLCβ4, and PIPLCγ1 protein had no significant effect on TDCA-induced
NOX5-S expression (Supplementary Data). The mechanisms
whereby Gαq proteins activate PI-PLCγ2 are not clear. It is
possible that Gαq first activates tyrosine kinase (39, 40) and
then activates PI-PLCγ isoforms (41–43).
PI-PLC has been shown to regulate ERK2 phosphorylation
in osteoblasts and macrophages (44, 45). ERK MAP kinases
are key kinases in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation
(46, 47). In addition, we have shown that activation of ERK
MAP kinases contributed to platelet-activating factor–
induced NOX5-S expression (48). Therefore, we examined
whether ERK MAP kinase plays a role in TDCA-induced
NOX5-S expression and H2O2 production. We found that
TDCA-induced increase in NOX5-S expression, H2O2 production, and cell proliferation was significantly reduced by the
MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that ERK MAP kinase is involved in TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression and

Figure 6. ERK2 phosphorylation in FLO EA cells. A, a typical example of Western blot analysis and summarized data showed that TDCA significantly
increased ERK2 MAP kinase phosphorylation, an increase that was significantly reduced by U73122. The data suggest that TDCA-induced ERK2
activation may depend on activation of PI-PLC. B, a typical example of Western blot analysis and summarized data showed that TDCA-induced ERK2
phosphorylation was significantly reduced by knockdown of PI-PLCγ2 protein, suggesting that TDCA-induced ERK2 activation may depend on activation
of PI-PLCγ2 in FLO EA cells. Transfection of siRNA was carried out with Lipofectamine 2000. Per well, 75 pmol of siRNA duplex of ERK2 or control
siRNA formulated into liposomes were applied. After a 4-h transfection, the transfection medium was replaced with regular medium. Twenty-four hours
after transfection, cells were treated with TDCA (10−9 mol/L) for 10 min, and then cells were collected for measurements (n = 3). *, P < 0.001, ANOVA,

H2O2 production. ERK MAP kinase has two isoforms: ERK1
and ERK2. These two isoforms can be activated respectively
or together in different cell biological process (49, 50). To examine which isoform(s) of ERK MAP kinases participates in
TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression and H2O2 production,
ERK1 and ERK2 protein expression were downregulated with
their siRNAs, respectively. Knockdown of ERK2 protein significantly reduced TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression, H2O2
production, and cell proliferation. Conversely, knockdown
of ERK1 protein did not have significant effect. The data suggest that TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression may depend on
activation of ERK2 MAP kinase, but not ERK1. To further
confirm the role of ERK2, we examined ERK2 phosphorylation after TDCA simulation. We found that TDCA significantly increased ERK2 phosphorylation, which was significantly
reduced by U73122 and by knockdown of PI-PLCγ2 protein,
suggesting that TDCA-induced activation of ERK2 MAP kinase may depend on activation of PI-PLCγ2. The data suggest that TDCA-induced NOX5-S expression may depend
on sequential activation of PI-PLC and ERK2 MAP kinase.
In conclusion, TDCA may induce increase in NOX5-S
expression, H2O2 production, and cell proliferation in EA

cells. This increase may depend on sequential activation of
PI-PLCγ2 and ERK2 MAP kinase. It is possible that bile acid
reflux present in patients with BE may increase ROS production and cell proliferation via activation of PI-PLCγ2, ERK2
MAP kinase, and NADPH oxidase NOX5-S, thereby causing
DNA damage and gene mutation, which contribute to the
development of EA. Our data may provide potential targets
to prevent and/or treat Barrett's EA.
