BACKGROUND: This phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00548093) assessed the efficacy, safety, and impact on health-related quality of life of dacomitinib (PF-00299804), an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of human epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR)/
HER1, HER2, and HER4, in patients with KRAS wild-type non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Patients with advanced NSCLC,
progression on 1 or 2 regimens of chemotherapy and erlotinib, KRAS wild-type or known EGFR-sensitizing mutant tumor, and Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 received 45 mg of dacomitinib once daily continuously in 21-day cycles.
RESULTS: A total of 66 patients enrolled (adenocarcinoma, n 5 50; those without adenocarcinoma [nonadenocarcinoma], n 5 16). The
objective response rate (ORR) for patients with adenocarcinoma (primary endpoint) was 5% (2 partial responses; 1-sided P 5.372 for
null hypothesis [H0]: ORR  5%) and 6% (1 partial response) for patients with nonadenocarcinoma. Responders included: 2 of 25
EGFR mutation-positive tumors; 1 of 3 EGFR wild-type with HER2 amplification. Median progression-free survival was 12 weeks overall
(n 5 66) and 18 weeks (n 5 26) for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors. Common treatment-related adverse events were of
grade 1 or 2 severity, manageable with standard supportive care, and included diarrhea (grade 3 [G3], 12%), acneiform dermatitis (G3,
6%), exfoliative rash (G3, 3%), dry skin (G3, 0%), fatigue (G3, 3%), and stomatitis (G3, 2%). Six patients (9%) discontinued due to
treatment-related adverse events. By patient report, NSCLC symptoms of dyspnea, cough, and pain (chest, arm/shoulder) showed
improvement first observed after 3 weeks on therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Dacomitinib demonstrated preliminary activity and acceptable
tolerability in heavily pretreated patients, and may offer benefit in molecularly defined patient subsets. Cancer 2014;120:1145–54.

INTRODUCTION
Following failure of chemotherapy and erlotinib, treatment options are limited for patients with advanced non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). Reversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as
erlotinib and gefitinib, selectively target EGFR/HER1, one of the members of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family, and are most effective in cancers harboring EGFR mutations. The remaining members of the HER family comprise HER2 and HER4 tyrosine kinases, and the kinase-null HER3.1 HER family members act together via
hetero- and homodimerization to enable downstream signaling pathways modulating a range of cellular activities, including growth, proliferation, differentiation, and migration.1 In contrast to patients with EGFR-mutation-positive tumors,

patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC are unlikely to
respond to gefitinib or erlotinib and do not have an
improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with
those who have placebo following erlotinib therapy.2
Dacomitinib (PF-00299804) is a potent, irreversible, oral small-molecule inhibitor of HER1/EGFR,
HER2, and HER4 tyrosine kinases with antitumor activity in both gefitinib-sensitive and gefitinib-resistant,
including EGFR T790M, preclinical NSCLC models.3,4
Dacomitinib demonstrated encouraging antitumor activity
against NSCLC in Western and Japanese patients in phase
1 studies,5,6 further supported by preliminary data from
phase 2 NSCLC studies conducted in Asian patients with
KRAS wild-type refractory disease7; unselected patients previously treated with chemotherapy8; and patients with
EGFR-mutant disease (first-line treatment).9 This phase 2
trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00548093) assessed
the efficacy, safety, and impact on health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) of dacomitinib in patients with KRAS wildtype NSCLC who progressed after 1 or 2 chemotherapy
regimens and erlotinib.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population

Main inclusion criteria were age 18 years, histologically
or cytologically confirmed advanced NSCLC, progression
on erlotinib and 1 or 2 regimens of chemotherapy, confirmation of KRAS wild-type tumor or known EGFR exon
19 deletion or EGFR exon 21 mutation (previously documented EGFR mutation was accepted when insufficient
tissue was available for KRAS testing), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)
of 0 to 2. Exclusion criteria included chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, biological or investigational agents, or surgery within 4 weeks of study entry; EGFR inhibitors
within 2 weeks of study entry; intolerance to erlotinib;
prior investigational EGFR-targeted therapy without
written agreement of the study sponsor; and uncontrolled
or significant cardiovascular disease.
Trial Design and Treatment

This was a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 trial. To
address differences in the expected response rates between
tumors of different histologies,10,11 2 cohorts, comprising
patients with adenocarcinoma and those without adenocarcinoma (nonadenocarcinoma), were enrolled. Patients
received 45 mg of dacomitinib once daily on an empty
stomach (2 hours before or after dacomitinib intake) on a
continuous basis during a 21-day cycle. Dose interruptions of <2 weeks without discontinuation from the study
1146

were allowed for toxicity; 2 dose attenuation levels of
30 mg and then 20 mg were allowed. Treatment was discontinued for disease progression, intolerance (grade 3 or
4 toxicity or intolerable grade 2 toxicity that does not
resolve to grade 1 or baseline after 2 weeks’ interruption),
global deterioration of health-related symptoms, protocol
noncompliance, or patient withdrawal.
The primary endpoint was best overall response
(BOR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) version 1.012 for patients with tumors
of adenocarcinoma histology. Secondary efficacy endpoints included: BOR in patients with tumors of nonadenocarcinoma histology, duration of objective response,
PFS, PFS at 6 months (PFS6M), overall survival (OS), and
OS at 6 (OS6M) and 12 (OS12M) months. Other secondary endpoints were safety; patient-reported outcomes
(PROs) of HRQoL; disease- and treatment-related symptoms; pharmacokinetics (PK); pre- and posttreatment
concentrations of the extracellular domains of HER2 and
EGFR in serum; and genetic variation in HER family and
KRAS genes from free tumor DNA in blood.
This trial was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the International Conference
on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines protocol, and was approved by the Institutional Review Boards
and/or Independent Ethics Committees at each of the participating investigational centers. All patients provided
written, informed consent prior to study participation.
Evaluation of Antitumor Activity

Evaluation of antitumor activity per RECIST version 1.012
was by investigator review. Tumor assessments were performed at baseline and at the end of every even-numbered
cycle or when progressive disease was suspected.
Evaluation of Safety and Tolerability

Safety and tolerability were assessed by standard methods
from initiation of study treatment until 28 days after the
last dose of study drug. Adverse events (AEs) were graded
by National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.
Pharmacokinetic Analyses, Biomarker
Determination, and Pharmacodynamic Analyses

Blood samples for PK analyses were collected up to 24
hours after dose on day 1 of cycle 1, before dose on days
2, 7, and 14 of cycle 1, and day 1 of cycle 2. PK parameters for dacomitinib, including the maximum concentration (Cmax), the time to Cmax (Tmax), and the area under
the plasma concentration curve from 0 to 24 hours
(AUC0-24), were analyzed using a noncompartmental

approach. Tumor tissue from new biopsies obtained at
enrollment or archival samples (which may have been
pre- or post-erlotinib) was analyzed for EGFR and KRAS
gene mutation status using Qiagen Scorpion ARMS
(Amplified Refractory Mutation System) allele-specific
polymerase chain reaction assay; HER2 mutation status
was determined by DNA sequencing. EGFR and HER2
gene amplification were assessed by fluorescence in situ
hybridization. EGFR amplification was defined as >15
copies of EGFR gene signals in >10% of analyzed cells;
HER2 amplification was defined as a HER2 gene/centromere of chromosome 17 ratio of >2. Blood samples for
biomarker analysis were collected at baseline and prior to
dosing on day 1 of each cycle. Concentrations of HER2
and EGFR extracellular domains were determined by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Patient-Reported Outcomes

PROs of HRQoL, disease symptoms specific to lung cancer, and side effects of treatment were assessed using the
30-question European Organisation for Research and
Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire core
module (EORTC QLQ-C30),13 which includes functional, symptom, side effects, and global health status
scales, and the 13-item Lung Cancer symptom-specific
module (QLQ-LC13).14 The impact of dacomitinib on
patients’ skin condition was assessed using the 10-item
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire.
Statistical Design and Analyses

The trial used a Fleming single-stage design for each
patient population (adenocarcinoma and nonadenocarcinoma, respectively). The primary objective of this study
was to test the null hypothesis (H0) at the 0.05 significance level with 80% power that the objective response
rate (ORR) in patients with adenocarcinoma did not
exceed 5%. At the end of the study, if there were at least 6
objective responders in 44 response-evaluable patients,
then the null hypothesis would be rejected, demonstrating
that treatment with dacomitinib is associated with a true
response rate that exceeds 5%. A secondary objective was
to test the H0 at the 0.05 significance level with 80%
power that the ORR in patients with nonadenocarcinoma
did not exceed 1%. At least 2 objective responders among
22 response-evaluable patients were required to reject the
null hypothesis and conclude that treatment with dacomitinib demonstrates a true response rate that exceeds 1%.
Target enrollment of 49 and 25 patients with adenocarcinoma and nonadenocarcinoma, respectively, was
required and accounted for a rate of nonevaluability for
Cancer

response of up to 10%. Baseline characteristics, PFS, PFS6M,
OS, OS6M, and OS12M were evaluated in the intent-to-treat
population, safety in the as-treated population, and response
was assessed in response-evaluable patients.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Disposition

Sixty-six patients were enrolled between April 2008 and
November 2009, 50 with adenocarcinoma and 16 with
nonadenocarcinoma. Patient disposition is shown in Fig. 1.
Enrollment of the nonadenocarcinoma arm was closed prior
to reaching the planned target of 25 due to few nonadenocarcinoma patients identified with prior erlotinib treatment.
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The majority of patients had received 2 or 3 prior treatment regimens (n 5 26 [39%] each). In addition to erlotinib prior
EGFR-directed therapies comprised gefitinib (n 5 4),
cetuximab (n 5 3), and neratinib (n 5 1). Fifty-five percent
of the enrolled population were current or former smokers.
Wild-type KRAS NSCLC was either directly confirmed
(n 5 54) or assumed from a known EGFR mutation
(n 5 12; EGFR mutation status was known for a total of 26
patients). Mutation and gene amplification data were collected from EGFR and HER2 according to availability of
sufficient tissue for analysis (Table 1). Six patients had
EGFR T790M resistance mutation identified after treatment with erlotinib (Supporting Table 1; see online supporting information). T790M status was unknown in 54
patients who had biopsies taken prior to progression on
erlotinib. Overall, 74% of patients started dacomitinib
within 3 months of discontinuing erlotinib. Of the 26
patients who had EGFR-mutant tumors at baseline, the
interval from discontinuing erlotinib to starting dacomitinib ranged from 15 to 544 days, with 69% starting dacomitinib within 3 months of discontinuing erlotinib.
Efficacy
Best Overall Response

In the overall population, the ORR for responseevaluable patients was 5.2% (3 partial responses [PRs] of
durations 12, 24, and 66 weeks). The ORR for patients
with adenocarcinoma was 4.8% (2 PRs; 1-sided
P 5 .372). For patients with nonadenocarcinoma, the
ORR was 6.3% (1 PR). The 25 response-evaluable
patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors (from
both arms) achieved an ORR of 8% (2 PRs) and 17
(68%) achieved a BOR of stable disease (SD) 6 weeks
(Table 2). Further details of the patients with PRs are
presented in Supporting Table 2. Six patients had known
EGFR T790M; of these, 3 had SD 6 weeks (9, 12, and

weeks based on 26 patients, with 21 (81%) achieving
PFS events; this median was longer than that seen in the
overall population. The 6 patients with documented
T790M had a median PFS of 7 weeks, which was similar
to that of patients with EGFR wild-type tumors
(8 weeks).
Overall Survival

At the time of data cutoff, 47 patients (71%) had died and
median OS was 37 weeks in the overall population,
45 weeks in patients with adenocarcinoma, and 27 weeks
in patients with nonadenocarcinoma (Fig. 3B). Of the
26 patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors (both
arms), median OS was 57 weeks, OS6M was 81%, and
OS12M was 59%.
Safety and Tolerability

The majority of treatment-related AEs were of grade 1 or
2 severity (Table 3) and were manageable with standard
supportive care. Common events included diarrhea
(85%), dermatitis acneiform (68%), dry skin (38%), fatigue (38%), exfoliative rash (24%), stomatitis (24%),
decreased appetite (23%), and pruritus (23%). One
patient experienced treatment-related grade 4 AEs of
dyspnea and pulmonary embolism considered by the investigator to be possibly related to study drug; 18 patients
(27%) experienced treatment-related AEs with a maximum severity of grade 3. The majority of patients
(n 5 44, 67%) did not require a dose reduction, and
interruption of daily dosing was seen in 33% for evaluation and management of AEs. Of the 22 patients who did

require dose reduction, 17 patients had 1 dose reduction
and 5 had 2 dose reductions. AEs resulting in dose modification were predominantly dermatologic or gastrointestinal. Six patients permanently discontinued dacomitinib
due to treatment-related AEs, which included grade 4
dyspnea (day 8) and grade 4 pulmonary embolism (day 9)
(both in a single patient); grade 3 fatigue (day 14); grade 3
exfoliative rash (day 134); grade 2 allergic dermatitis
(day 3); grade 2 fatigue (day 85); and grade 1 fatigue (day
43). Twelve deaths occurred within 28 days following the
last dose of dacomitinib and were reported as serious AEs;
none was considered to be treatment-related.
Patient-Reported Outcomes

Completion rates for the EORTC QLQ-C30/-LC13 and
DLQI questionnaires were high throughout the study (generally >90% of patients answered at least one question).
Patients with radiographic disease control reported
improvement in lung cancer symptoms of dyspnea,

cough, pain in chest, and pain in arm/shoulder relative to
baseline scores, first observed after 3 weeks on therapy
(Supporting Fig. 1A). Diarrhea was the most commonly
reported class-related AE; diarrhea peaked at cycle 3, day
1 (week 6) and remained stable over time (Supporting
Fig. 1B). With a score of 0 5 no symptoms and
100 5 most symptoms, patients on dacomitinib reported
scores that were at the midpoint in the range at their
worst. The impact of dacomitinib on PRO for NSCLC
symptoms and dermatologic toxicity has been previously
presented, and will be subsequently reported in full
(Campbell AK et al; unpublished data).
Pharmacokinetics

PK parameters (overall and by histology) following a single
dose (cycle 1 day 1), and mean Ctrough values after multiple
doses for dose-compliant patients (Supporting Table 3)
were consistent with those previously reported.5,15
Pharmacodynamics

Soluble HER2 and EGFR levels were slightly decreased
on day 1 of most cycles compared with baseline for most
patients. One patient with nonadenocarcinoma demonstrating HER2 amplification had elevated baseline soluble
1152

HER2 that significantly declined to population normal
baseline levels upon treatment with dacomitinib. This
patient’s tumor also demonstrated a PR.16,17
DISCUSSION
In this phase 2 trial, dacomitinib demonstrated an overall
response rate of 5% but the primary endpoint of this study
was not met. Three PRs were observed, 2 in patients with
EGFR mutation-positive tumors and 1 in a patient whose
tumor was EGFR wild-type with HER2 amplification.16,17
In contrast, patients with known EGFR T790M did not
respond to dacomitinib therapy despite efficacy in preclinical models. These observations could be due to the presence
of concurrent drug resistance mechanisms (such as MET
amplification),18 or to the inability of dacomitinib to fully
inhibit EGFR in tumors harboring EGFR T790M at the
doses currently under clinical investigation.5 Strategies to
improve EGFR inhibition in EGFR T790M cancers
include the combination of irreversible EGFR inhibitors
with the EGFR-directed antibody cetuximab (as reported
for afatinib plus cetuximab)19; the development of more
potent and specific inhibitors of EGFR T790M20,21; and
the use of intermittent but high doses of existing irreversible
EGFR inhibitors.18 In contrast, where resistance is

mediated by compensatory signaling pathways, or tumors
harbor more than one concomitant drug resistance mechanism, combination strategies with targeted agents in appropriately selected patients will be necessary to treat such
cancers (eg, inhibition of the MET pathway).
In the absence of a known oncogene addiction, patients
with wild-type EGFR may still benefit from EGFR-directed
therapy in the absence of a RECIST-defined radiographic
response; endpoints such as PFS, and patient report of HRQoL
and symptom relief have become increasingly important in a
noncurative setting.22 This is demonstrated in the BR21 trial of
erlotinib versus placebo, where the ORR was low and yet was
associated with improvements versus placebo in OS and
NSCLC symptoms.10,23 In the current study in refractory
NSCLC, 10 of 36 patients with SD as BOR derived prolonged clinical benefit (SD  6 months) with dacomitinib;
patients also reported a rapid onset of improvement in key
lung cancer symptoms, with symptomatic improvements
remaining durable over the course of therapy. Common
AEs were typically gastrointestinal or dermatologic and
consistent with targeting EGFR.24,25 By patient report,
both gastrointestinal and dermatologic symptoms peaked
early in treatment and stabilized or improved over time
(Campbell AK et al; unpublished data).
The benefits seen in this study may reflect dacomitinib’s broader mode of action in targeting all kinase-active
HER family members, irreversible binding to the tyrosine
kinase domain, retreatment in some of those patients with
an EGFR-driven tumor following a period off treatment
after a prior selective EGFR TKI, or other as yet to be
determined factors. Data from this and other phase 1 and
2 studies in post-EGFR TKI settings,5,7 and from a headto-head trial comparing dacomitinib with erlotinib in the
second-line setting,8 suggest that dacomitinib has clinically relevant activity in patients with NSCLC who do not
harbor KRAS mutations. However, in the absence of a
control arm, it remains unclear if this degree of benefit
seen here could be due to patient selection or favorable
prognostic factors. A phase 3 trial is underway to determine the efficacy and safety of dacomitinib compared
with erlotinib in patients with KRAS wild-type NSCLC
for whom first-line chemotherapy has failed (ARCHER
1009; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01360554).
