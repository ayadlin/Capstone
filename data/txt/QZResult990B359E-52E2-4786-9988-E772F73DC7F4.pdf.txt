Bevacizumab-Induced Vessel Normalization Hampers Tumor Uptake
of Antibodies—Response
€ der, and Elisabeth G.E. de Vries

We would like to reply to the letter by Huang and colleagues
on the impact of vascular changes induced by antiangiogenic
therapy on tumor uptake of other drugs in relation to our
ﬁndings of reduced antibody uptake after bevacizumab treatment (1). Their comments focus on the bevacizumab dose used
and whether vessel normalization was demonstrated.
They consider the bevacizumab dose we used high and
suggest that this resulted in "inadequate" rather than "normalized" tumor vessels. The concept of too high bevacizumab
dosing is interesting and might have a major impact if translated to the clinic. Huang and colleagues reported on ﬁndings
in a preclinical study with 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg of the mouse
anti-VEGFR2 antibody DC101 where the highest dose resulted
neither in vessel normalization nor improved efﬁcacy of
immunotherapy (2). It is unclear whether these ﬁndings with
anti-VEGFR2 antibody can be translated directly to our results
with bevacizumab, which binds VEGF-A, affecting both VEGR1
and VEGFR2 signaling.
In our mouse model, one modest dose of 5 mg/kg bevacizumab reduced the tumor uptake of radiolabeled trastuzumab
and aspeciﬁc control immunoglobulin G (IgG) by 38% and 27%,
respectively, after only 2 days. On day 6, after three 5 mg/kg
bevacizumab doses, this decrease was even more pronounced
for radiolabeled trastuzumab, bevacizumab, and IgG (1). Moreover, these decreases are all within the described vascular
normalization time window (3). We found increased pericyte
coverage after bevacizumab treatment, indicating structural
vessel normalization. This may not prove functional vessel
normalization. However, tumor histology showed no difference in already low percentages of necrosis, tumor viability, or
proliferation index between animals receiving bevacizumab or
placebo. This is not in line with inadequate vasculature caused
by high-dose antiangiogenic therapy (3).

Our ﬁndings of reduced uptake of antibodies after antiangiogenic therapy are supported by two preclinical studies. One
10 mg/kg dose of the cross-reactive anti-VEGF antibody B204.1 decreased tumor trastuzumab uptake by 50% after 2 days
(4) and 10 mg/kg bevacizumab decreased tumor cetuximab
uptake by 40% after 4 days (5). Importantly, our ﬁndings are
also supported in the clinical setting, as a study in patients with
renal cell carcinoma showed 47% decrease of 89Zr-bevacizumab tumor uptake after 10 mg/kg bevacizumab (6). Furthermore, large phase III trials showed only modest effects of
bevacizumab combined with trastuzumab in HER2-positive
breast cancer and negative effects when combined with cetuximab or panitumumab in colorectal cancer.
Combining bevacizumab with chemotherapy, in a dosage
that is high according to Huang and colleagues, showed also
disappointing results, as it did not improve overall survival in
breast and ovarian cancer. Nonetheless, chemotherapy with a
relatively low dose of 5 mg/kg bevacizumab in metastatic
colorectal and a high dose of 15 mg/kg in non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) every 2 weeks improved overall survival (7, 8).
Jain (3) suggested that the reduced tumor uptake of radiolabeled docetaxel in patients with NSCLC may be the consequence of a too high bevacizumab dose of 15 mg/kg (9).
However, also 24 hours after 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab, radiolabeled 5-ﬂuorouracil uptake decreased 20% in liver metastases of patients with colorectal cancer (10).
This illustrates that many aspects of the interplay between
vessel normalization, antiangiogenic therapy dosing, and combination with other anticancer drugs still need to be clariﬁed.
Like Huang and colleagues, we are interested in using imaging
for this purpose. Small exploratory studies could visualize
effects of antiangiogenic drugs on distribution of other labeled
drugs, provide serial information on whole body drug distribution, and guide rational trial design for large combinatorial
studies. The ultimate goal is optimal drug delivery to individual
tumors.
