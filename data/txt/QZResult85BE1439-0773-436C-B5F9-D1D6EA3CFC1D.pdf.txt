Abstract
Electrochemotherapy represents a strategy to enhance chemotherapeutic drug uptake by delivering electrical
pulses which exceed the dielectric strength of the cell membrane, causing transient formation of structures that
enhance permeabilization. Here we show that brain tumors in a rat model can be eliminated by electrochemotherapy with a novel electrode device developed for use in the brain. By using this method, the cytotoxicity
of bleomycin can be augmented more than 300-fold because of increased permeabilization and more direct
passage of drug to the cytosol, enabling highly efficient local tumor treatment. Bleomycin was injected
intracranially into male rats inoculated with rat glia-derived tumor cells 2 weeks before the application of
the electrical field (32 pulses, 100 V, 0.1 ms, and 1 Hz). In this model, where presence of tumor was confirmed by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before treatment, we found that 9 of 13 rats (69%) receiving electrochemotherapy displayed a complete elimination of tumor, in contrast to control rats treated with bleomycin
only, pulses only, or untreated where tumor progression occurred in each case. Necrosis induced by electrochemotherapy was restricted to the treated area, which MRI and histology showed to contain a fluid-filled cavity.
In a long-range survival study, treatment side effects seemed to be minimal, with normal rat behavior observed
after electrochemotherapy. Our findings suggest that electrochemotherapy may offer a safe and effective new
tool to treat primary brain tumors and brain metastases. Cancer Res; 71(11); 3753–62. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Primary and secondary malignant tumors of the brain
constitute a significant challenge in cancer treatment. Surgery,
radiotherapy, and medical treatment are advancing, but the
prognosis is still grim and morbidity considerable (1, 2).
Electroporation-based treatments may be a new contributor in inhibiting tumor recurrence, while giving rise to limited
side effects (3–7). Electroporation—permeabilization of membranes by electrical pulses—has become an expanding
research field, both within nonthermal irreversible electroporation from which cell membranes do not recover and cell
death ensues (3, 4, 7–9), and within reversible electroporation
where cell membranes do reseal and only transiently allow
drugs (10, 11) or genes (12–20) to enter the otherwise intact
cell.

Electrochemotherapy designates the use of electroporation
to enhance local uptake of chemotherapeutic agents (21–24),
enabling an increase in cytotoxicity of a staggering 300-fold in
the case of bleomycin. What is well known is that electrochemotherapy with its high efficiency may be used as a onceonly treatment, and that no treated cancer histology has yet
been unresponsive to the treatment (25). Both these factors are
an advantage for tumors in internal organs, including intracranial tumors. Electroporation-based treatments in internal
organs are ongoing (www.clinicaltrials.gov; refs. 26, 27).
Bleomycin is well known in oncology and is used in standard
treatment regimens; for example, its use in testicular cancer
(28) and intracerebral use are well described (29). The choice of
bleomycin as the cytotoxic agent for electrochemotherapy has
been previously described (5, 6, 22, 25, 30–32) and has a solid
scientific base; thus, bleomycin acts as an enzyme creating 10
to 15 DNA strand breaks per molecule (33), which is a far more
efficient rate than any other chemotherapeutic agent. Bleomycin is large, charged, and hydrophilic, and the cell membrane
will under normal circumstances keep it from the actual target
of the drug, namely DNA. Electroporation offers direct access
over the cell membrane in the area encompassed by the
electrodes, allowing bleomycin to exert its cytotoxic potential
much more efficiently. Bleomycin as a single drug has been
tried in the treatment of brain tumors before, with acceptable
toxicity but limited efficacy (29). Only one previous study, by
Salford and colleagues (34), investigated the use of reversible
electroporation in a rat brain tumor model facilitating the

uptake of bleomycin (electrochemotherapy) by using 2 acupuncture needles inserted into rat brains inoculated with
tumor cells. In this study, survival was improved by a few
days; however, the electrical field between 2 single needles is of
limited extension.
We have now developed an electrode device, which can be
inserted through a single burr hole, with electrodes that may
be subsequently deployed in a cone-shaped formation to treat
a target area much larger than the burr hole. Electrochemotherapy, encompassing intracranial injection of bleomycin
followed by pulses, was carried out in normal and tumorbearing rats in short- and long-term studies with the use of
this novel brain electroporation device to explore electrochemotherapy as a new treatment modality for brain tumors.

of infection. The N32 rat glioma cells have been shown to grow
readily in in vitro systems, as well as intracerebrally to develop
tumors, and are only weakly immunogenic (35). A cell culture
sample from stock solution was prepared 2 to 3 weeks before
inoculation, and 3,000 N32 cells were inoculated (5 mL). The
skull area around bregma was accessed with scalpel and a burr
hole (5 mm diameter) made by trepan drill. Injection was at 4mm depth at the stereotaxic coordinates X ¼ 2, Y ¼ 1, Z ¼ 4
(Kopf 962 Dual Ultra Precise Small Animal Stereotaxic Instrument). Micrometer positioning ensured gentle needle passage
(Neoflon 24GA or Spinal Needle 27GA; Becton Dickinson and
company) into the brain tissue, and a pump (Univentor U-802
Syringe Pump; AgnTho's AB) was used to inject cells. The burr
hole was covered by bone wax (B|Braun) and the skin sutured.

Materials and Methods

Electrochemotherapy
In experimental setup 1, an initial prototype with only 4
electrodes as well as an improved 8-electrode device were
developed (Sonion A/S; Fig. 1); after this only the 8-electrode
device was used. Electrochemotherapy was carried out by
initial intracranial injection of 42 IU of bleomycin contained in
14 mL (freeze-dried 15,000 IU Bleomycin, Baxter A/S, dissolved
in 5 mL isotonic NaCl; X ¼ 2, Y ¼ 1, Z ¼ -4), by using a pump,
and leaving the needle in the tissue for 5 minutes before
retraction. The 8-electrode device was deployed through the
burr hole to treatment depth at 5 mm (X ¼ 2, Y ¼ 1, Z ¼ 5),
and 32 pulses (4  8 pulses; Fig. 1), each of 100 V, 0.1 ms
duration, 1 Hz were applied. This electrode gave rise to an
electrical field of at least 280 V/cm in an area of 100 mm3. The
4-electrode device was used for 8 pulses (Fig. 1). Pulses were
delivered by a square pulse generator (Cliniporator; IGEA),
and polarity of the electrodes was switched after each pulse by
using a switch box (Sonion A/S). All treatments were carried
out as "once only" in each rat, and no rats received more than
one treatment modality.

Study design
Three experimental designs, each conducted through 2 to 4
independent experiments, were carried out in rats.
Experimental setup 1 (n ¼ 60): What are the appropriate
brain electrodes and parameters for electrochemotherapy in
the rat brain? Tumor cells were inoculated in the rat brain, and
after 1 to 2 weeks electrochemotherapy, electroporation only,
bleomycin only, or NaCl were injected followed by electroporation by using a 4- or 8-electrode device, respectively. After
treatment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out
repeatedly and animals were observed for 1.5 weeks.
Experimental setup 2 (n ¼ 25): Could electrochemotherapy eliminate rat brain tumors? Tumor cells were inoculated
and only after MRI verification of tumor, rats were treated by
electrochemotherapy, electroporation alone, or bleomycin
alone by using the 8-electrode device. After treatment, MRI
was carried out repeatedly and the animals were observed for
up to 3 weeks, with prior termination if symptoms or MRI
indicated too large tumor size.
Experimental setup 3 (n ¼ 15): What is the long-term effect
of electrochemotherapy in the rat brain? The long-term effects
of electrochemotherapy by the 8-electrode device in healthy
brain tissue were studied with repeated MRI, and observation
for 8 weeks.
Animals
Male rats [Fischer (F344/SCA), Scanbur AB (#1), and Sprague Dawley, Taconic (#2 and #3)], were 7 to 11 months old and
were kept at Glostrup Research Institute. Protocol was
approved by The Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate.
Anesthesia for surgery or MR scanning was by s.c. injection
of Hypnorm (VetaPharma Ltd.) with Midazolam (Hameln
Pharmaceuticals GmbH) or Dormicum (Roche, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG,). Analgesia was administered twice over
48 hours with Rimadyl (50 mg/mL, Pfizer Aps.).
Inoculation of N32 glioma-derived cells
N32 cells were kindly provided by Leif Salford (Lund University, Sweden; ref. 30) in 2008. They were maintained and
prepared as previously described (36) and tested by rapid
MAP-27 panel (Taconic) last in November 2010 without signs

MRI
A human 3 Tesla MRI system was used (Achieva, Philips).
The head of the sedated rat was placed in a 50-mm 4-channel
phased array animal coil (Animal Coil; Shanghai Chenguang
Medical Technologies). Both T2-weighted turbo spin echo
sequences (TR/TE: 4847/100; FOV/matrix: 50/248; 1-mm
slices and scan time: 5:58 minutes), and T1-weighted sagittal
gradient echo sequences (TR/TE/FA: 31/10/30; FOV/matrix:
50/500; 1 mm slices and scan time: 7:21 minutes) before
and after i.v. contrast agent administration by tail vein
(0.3 mmol/kg Dotarem; Guerbet) were carried out, supplemented by a postcontrast transverse T1-weighted gradient
echo (TR/TE/FA: 31:10:30, FOV/matrix: 50:625, 1-mm slices,
scan time 13:37 minutes). Blankets and heating pads were
used.

Termination
Rats were terminated by anesthesia followed by lethal
pentobarbital injection. Animals were perfused with isotonic
NaCl followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and kept at 5 C for at
least 24 hours before further procedures.

Results

Histology
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), PAS, and immunohistochemical staining were done according to standard protocols.
Immunohistochemical staining of neurofilaments (NF) was
done with monoclonal mouse anti-human, 2F11 (Dako), and
for glial filament (GFAP) polyclonal rabbit anti-GFAP (Dako)
was used. The following characteristics were listed and graded
by an experienced pathologist, blinded with respect to treatment status: presence of (i) tumor or tumor cells, (ii) necrotic
tissue, (iii) macrophages, (iv) erythrocyte traces, and (v) condensed or lacking NF or glial filaments shown by immunohistochemical staining, all graded 0 to 3. The score 0 was given
for the normal situation, whereas a score of 3 indicated a
highly abnormal situation in the area of interest. We used an
Olympus BX50 microscope (Olympus lenses, plan objective
2), Olympus color view 1 camera (Tubus, UTV, 0.5xG3), and
Olympus soft imaging system (analySIS getIT; Olympus).
Statistical analysis

Brain tumor response to treatment
Electrochemotherapy induced regression and elimination
of tumor in the targeted brain areas in 9 of 13 rats over 2 to 3
weeks, whereas 8 control rats showed tumor progression as
shown in Fig. 2 (experimental setup 2, 8-electrode device),
where tumor volume measured on MRI is shown (Fig. 2A)
along with a survival curve (Fig. 2B) indicating when rats were
euthanized due to large tumor size. Tumors were verified
before treatment by MRI and had a mean size of 7 mm3
(range, 1–34).
Immediately after electrochemotherapy or electroporation and lasting for up to 1 week, treatment effects appeared
as similar sized areas (low SEM) with a diffused transition
zone between contrast and noncontrast-enhanced brain
tissue. Images from 6 consecutive MRI scans of a rat that
had received electrochemotherapy are shown in Fig. 3. In
general, we observed that this short-term treatment effect
on contrast enhancement is not clearly distinguishable from
contrast enhancement reflecting a tumor, and the measurements listed in Fig. 2A include the entire contrast enhancement observed.
Among the 13 rats treated with electrochemotherapy, 9 rats
(69%) showed regression of tumor and then no tumor, and 4
rats (31%) showed tumor progression. Of the 4 rats showing
progression, 1 had tumor cell remains outside the treatment
target area, and 3 rats were characterized by having the 3

largest initial tumors before treatment. There were 8 rats in
the control treatment group, represented by untreated rats
(n ¼ 4), rats treated with electroporation only (n ¼ 2), or with
bleomycin only (n ¼ 2). All control rats had statistically
significantly increased tumor size (contrast enhancement)
already within 1 week after tumor appeared on MRI (P <
0.01), as well as after 2 weeks (P < 0.01), compared with rats
given electrochemotherapy; all control rats needed to be
terminated prior to the end of experiment because of tumor
progression, and none showed any sign of treatment effect.
The statistical tests are based on results including treatment
effect seen within the first week. The Kaplan–Meier survival
curve (Fig. 2B) reflects termination because of tumor progression, and the difference between the 2 groups was significant

tissue showing contrast enhancement similar to tumor
(1 rat), and small tumors on MRI not later confirmed (2 rats).
Histologic analyses showed consistency with the end-stage
MRI confirming presence or absence of tumors (Fig. 4). The
initial sizes of the tumors are similar for the 2 rats in Fig. 4, but
the rat receiving electrochemotherapy had no tumor or tumor
cell remains at termination (30 days). The rat receiving
electroporation only had a tumor with characteristics also
seen in human glioblastoma multiforme (intratumoral necrosis, pseudo-palisading necrosis) at termination (24 days).
In total, 9 of 13 rats (69%), with MRI-confirmed tumor
that were given electrochemotherapy had no tumor on termination, and all of 8 rats receiving no treatment (n ¼ 4),
bleomycin (n ¼ 2), or pulses only (n ¼ 2) had tumor progression and early termination was necessary.

Rat brain tissue reactions to treatment
In experimental setup 1, the effect of electrochemotherapy
for the initial 4-electrode device prototype and the improved
8-electrode device showed dose–response, with the 8-electrode device having the highest impact on brain tissue both
visually (Fig. 5) and quantitatively (Fig. 6). Electrochemotherapy is characterized by impacting rat brain tissue in the
targeted area only (Fig. 5) corresponding to and restricted
by the electrical field distribution (Fig. 1). The 8-electrode
device was significantly superior to the 4-electrode device,
showing more severe morphologic changes with extensive
necrosis, macrophage invasion, bleeding spots, loss of neurons
and astrocytes (represented by their filaments), and no presence of tumors or tumor cell remains shown by H&E, NF, and
GFAP staining (Fig. 6). These effects of electrochemotherapy
are easily distinguishable from brain tissue reaction to plain
electroporation, bleomycin, or NaCl, where only macrophage
invasion could match the effect found with electrochemotherapy, except for bleomycin, which also showed moderate
impact on astrocytes (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).
Long-term effect of electrochemotherapy in healthy rat
brain tissue
Experimental setup 3 pursued the long-term effect of
electrochemotherapy (n ¼ 8), bleomycin, or electroporation
(n ¼ 7) in healthy rat brain tissue, with no prior inoculation of
tumor cells. We found no long-term effect of either bleomycin
or electroporation. For the rats treated with electrochemotherapy, repeated MRI (data not shown) suggests an
ongoing process toward increased tissue degradation and
increased presence of tissue fluid other than blood (e.g.,
cerebrospinal fluid) in the treated area at in vivo follow-up
by MRI for 8 weeks. The targeted area gradually lost contrast
enhancement and gradually increased appearance of dark
areas (on T1-weighted scans), suggesting an emerging fluidfilled space, as shown in Fig. 7A1 and B1. At termination, all
these brains showed substantial loss of tissue in targeted
areas. Histologic analyses showed healthy brain tissue in
proximity to clearly distinguishable cavities at the location
of the targeted area of the brain for all 8 rats after electrochemotherapy (Fig. 7A2 and B2). We found no histologic

evidence of remains of necrotic cells or bleeding but occasional presence of very few macrophages in bordering healthy
tissue. Histologic analyses of control rats showed no sign of
cavity formations, but minor traces after intrusion with intracranially bleomycin injection were observed.
Tolerability
On the basis of our records from the pilot project as well as
from the reported experiments, the anesthesia and analgesia
were in general well tolerated by the rats. Incidence of rupture
of superior sagittal sinus during the surgical procedure (drilling) was less than 5%. All rats recovering from analgesia
regained normal rat behavior within 48 hours with no
observed characteristic or adverse behavior related to treatment status. Posttreatment mortality was observed in less
than 1% of the treated rats. Long-term effect of electrochemotherapy revealed loss of tissue corresponding to the targeted area, but basic normal rat behaviors were maintained
until termination date. We did not observe any obvious
difference in basic behavior between rats receiving different
treatments in the short-term studies. Specifically, no abnormalities in terms of motor function or behavior were observed,
and the treated and control groups responded similarly to
sedation and experimental procedures.

Discussion
The use of electrical pulses to create transient permeabilization in the cell membrane (electroporation) is well
characterized (21, 23, 24), and so is the combination with
a cytotoxic agent to enhance the efficacy of this agent by
creating direct access to the cell cytosol (5, 6, 12, 22, 25, 30–
32). This study is the first report of electrochemotherapy of
experimental brain tumors in rats with a novel expandable

electrode, and we have shown that this treatment method is
highly effective with complete resolution of 69% of treated
tumors after once-only treatment. Furthermore, treatment
effects are localized to the target area, and the toxicity
profile is favorable, with no apparent influence on rat
behavior or morbidity.
A grim prognosis and substantial morbidity continue to be
associated with both primary and secondary (metastatic)
brain tumors (1, 2). From previous experience with electrochemotherapy of superficial tumors (5, 6, 25, 30, 32), it is
known that this treatment modality has proven highly efficient regardless of tumor histology and as a once-only treatment also after previous radio- or chemotherapy (5, 6, 25, 38).
Furthermore, electrical pulses may be delivered in a few
seconds, enabling intraoperative treatment. We therefore
decided to test a novel electrode device for electroporation
of brain tumors in the hope that the encouraging preclinical
results in this study could be translated to treatment of
primary and secondary brain tumors in the clinic.
Development of electrodes
Only one previous study reports the use of electrochemotherapy in an animal model of brain cancer, dating back
to 1993 (34). Here, the investigators used 2 opposing acupuncture needles to apply the electrical field, giving rise to a
rather small treatment area. In this study, we have tested an
electrode which may enter through a burr hole and expand to
cover an area larger than the insertion (39, 40). Furthermore,
pulse sequencing has been developed, to ensure sufficient
coverage of the treatment area (Fig. 1).
Electrochemotherapy of brain tumors
Having the electrode device it was possible to move on to
the first and fundamental question: Does the electrode device

work? In experimental setup 1, 4- and 8-electrode devices were
tested, and it was found that areas of necrosis after electrochemotherapy corresponded to the configuration of the
2 electrode devices. Furthermore, the combination of drug
and pulses gave rise to necrosis in the treatment area
whereas only pulses or only drug did not, as previously
described (38, 41).
The second very important pair of questions was as
follows: Can we determine presence of established tumors
on MRI before treatment, and what is the success rate of
electrochemotherapy when macroscopic tumors are present? We found that tumors could be seen on MRI, but also
that we could see the overlay of the treatment area as an
extended zone of contrast enhancement around the tumor
itself. The initial increase in volume, also for tumors that
later disappeared, could be caused by a treatment-related
effect around the tumor. We could not distinguish the
boundary between the actual tumor and treatment effects
on MRI; however, the latter subsided within a week. Recent
research indicates that in the future diffusion-weighted MRI
may give additional information on the treatment volume
(42).
The complete disappearance of 69% of treated tumors was
highly encouraging, but not necessarily unexpected. Thus, in
the treatment of cutaneous tumors complete remission rates
have been reported to be between 60% and 90% (25, 41, 43). In
our animal model, we treated an area measuring approximately 100 mm3 and observed a 69% remission. It has been
shown that in larger tumors the success rate is lower (43), in

concordance with the fact that every part of the tumor must
be covered by the electrical field to achieve success (42, 44–46).
It is noteworthy that 3 of the 4 rats that were not successfully
treated in the study had the largest tumors when treated,
indicating that it is likely that the success rate is very high
when the tumor is encompassed by the electrode. The electrode used in this study is a prototype for use in rats, and it was
only placed once. We are anticipating use of an electrode
device for treatment in humans, but this will be with a larger
electrode device (39), that can be sequentially deployed to
cover a larger tumor volume.
To respond to the third very important question—is brain
electrochemotherapy safe?—the next step of the study was
to subject healthy rats to electrochemotherapy. By not
inoculating the rats with brain tumor cells, possible interference from tumor growth could be avoided. MRI scans and
behavioral assessments were carried out, as well as histology
at the end of the observation period.
Again, histologic sections revealed far more pronounced
effects after electrochemotherapy than after pulses or drug
alone. This was also evident from MRI scans, and as shown in
Fig. 7, the treatment area was subjected to necrosis and
subsequent resolution, revealing a fluid-filled cavity not unlike
radiological findings after stroke.
The behavioral observations included basic motor ability
and orientation behavior (i.e., neurologic dysfunction and
hemiparesis), and no obvious effects on these were found,
despite the marked findings on MRI. Although treatmentrelated effects were present at MRI (Fig. 3), this did not seem

to affect rat behavior, probably because it was limited to part
of the brain.
What is known from previous studies of electrochemotherapy with bleomycin is that the number of molecules
internalized may influence the type of cell death that ensues
(33). A window of opportunity exists in which normal tissue
may be spared whereas tumor tissue will be severely affected
(25). As described in this article, intratumoral injections of
bleomycin were carried out in our study. This regimen
tends to give a high number of molecules internalized,
leading to necrosis of both tumor tissue and normal tissue
(47). From clinical studies, we know that normal tissue may
be spared whereas efficient tumor cell kill is obtained with
i.v. administration (25), because i.v. administration gives a
lower and more evenly distributed tissue dose, and this may
allow treatment within a therapeutic window. Further

experiments on lowering bleomycin tissue dose, including
i.v. administration may further elucidate the question of how
to obtain complete tumor regression while preserving normal tissue in the brain.
Several studies have documented an antivascular effect of
both electrical pulses and the combination of electrical pulses
and bleomycin (electrochemotherapy; refs. 3, 48). Thus, in
addition to electrical pulses affecting perfusion and endothelial cells, bleomycin also has known activity against endothelial cells and has been used in treatment of vascular
malformations (49). This antivascular effect may in fact be
very important in the tumor response seen with both
irreversible electroporation and electrochemotherapy (3, 4,
8, 48, 50).
Recently published studies on irreversible electroporation
(3, 4, 7–9) have shown encouraging results in tumor treatment

in canine models, as well as evidence of normal tissue preservation (9). When combining electrical pulses with bleomycin, a lower field strength can be used, as shown in this study.
The overall, and highly encouraging conclusion, is that a novel
treatment paradigm with the use of electrical pulses in cancer
treatment may lead to efficient ablation with limited side
effects, and that further research may expand the use of this
technology even further.
An electroporation device has been developed for the clinic,
namely a 13-electrode device which will be able to encompass
a larger treatment area (www.clinicaltrials.gov ref. 42).

Potential side effects to electrochemotherapy in the human
brain encompass risk of anesthetic complication, hemorrhage,
and infection. Relaxation to prevent peripheral motor
response during the electrochemotherapy procedure and
general anesthesia will be necessary. However, the electrochemotherapy procedure can be short because the electrical
pulses are quickly delivered. Edema will ensue, but focally
where the electrochemotherapy has been carried out, as has
indeed been seen at the MRI studies in the present study.
Steroids may ameliorate edema.

Conclusions
The data presented here represent the first study on brain
electrochemotherapy with the use of an expandable electrode device, enabling treatment of larger brain tumors
through a burr hole. Results are highly encouraging, showing
a high level of efficacy with a 69% complete response rate
and limited toxicity. The results are similar to what has been
shown in clinical trials of electrochemotherapy for skin
metastases, and this would lead to optimism regarding
the possibilities for electrochemotherapy to be of benefit
to patients suffering from primary or secondary cancers of
the brain.
