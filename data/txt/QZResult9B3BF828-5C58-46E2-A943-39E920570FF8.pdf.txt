ABSTRACT
High levels of arsenic in drinking water, soil, and air are associated with the
higher incidences of several kinds of cancers worldwide, but the mechanism is yet
to be fully discovered. Recently, a number of evidences show that dysregulation
of microRNAs (miRNAs) induces carcinogenesis. In this study, we found miR-222
was upregulated in arsenic-transformed human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells
(As-T cells). Anti-miR-222 inhibitor treatment decreased cell proliferation, migration,
tube formation, and induced apoptosis. In addition, anti-miR-222 inhibitor expression
decreased tumor growth in vivo. We also found that inhibition of miR-222 induced the
expression of its direct targets ARID1A and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
on chromosome 10 (PTEN), and activated apoptosis of As-T cells in part through
ARID1A downregulation. These results indicate that miR-222 plays an important role
in arsenic-induced tumor growth.

INTRODUCTION

reported that miR-222 is an oncogene that is upregulated
in many cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma,
cervical cancer, and gastric carcinoma. miR-222 can
increase migration and proliferation of tumor cell, and
inhibit apoptosis by regulating different targets such as
PTEN [9], p27 [10], and TIMP3 [11]. Overexpression
of miR-222 is correlated with the poor prognosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer (MSCLC) and miR-122 may be
used as a biomarker for selecting the Tube formation assay
patients who require especial attention [12].
Recently, arsenic has been found to regulate
expression of some miRNAs. It was reported that several
miRNAs were upregulated; while miR-199a, miR-200b,
miR-164, and miR-171 were downregulated in response
to arsenic treatment [13, 14]. It was also reported that
miR-21 is upregulated by arsenic to induce angiogenesis

Long-term exposure to arsenic can result in skin,
liver, lung, and other types of cancer [1–3]. Arsenic
was identified as an environmental carcinogen by the
International Center for Research on Cancer in 1987 and
the USA Environmental Protection Agency in the 1990s
[4]. But new molecular mechanisms of arsenic-induced
carcinogenesis remain to be elucidated.
A number of studies have shown a close relationship
between microRNA (miRNA) and the occurrence
of cancers [5, 6]. MiRNAs may play roles as tumor
suppressors or oncogenes through their targets. The
abnormal expression of miRNAs exists widely in tumor
tissues. MiR-199a and miR-145 are commonly regarded
as tumor suppressor genes in many cancers [7, 8]. It is

Treatment of cells using anti-miR-222 inhibitor
decreases cell proliferation, migration, tube
formation, and tumor growth

and to enhance the invasive potential of transformed cells
[15, 16]. Our previous study showed that miR-199a is
downregulated in arsenic-transformed (As-T) cells, and
arsenic inhibited miR-199a expression for decreasing
angiogenesis [17]. But the roles and mechanisms of
miRNAs in arsenic-induced tumor growth are not fully
elucidated.
The present study addresses the following questions:
(1) the expression and the role of miR-222 in cell
proliferation, migration and tube formation in cells; (2) the
role of miR-222 in tumor growth; and (3) the functional
relevant target(s) of miR-222 in As-T cells.

To study the potential biological function of
miR-222 in As-T cells, the cells stably overexpressing
miR-222 inhibitor (As-T/Anti-miR-222) or negative
control (As-T/Anti-miR-NC) were established, confirming
the successful establishment of the stable cells (Figure 2A).
The proliferation rates of As-T cells with forced
expression of anti-miR-222 inhibitor were significantly
decreased after 72 h post cell seeding compared
with the control cells (Figure 2B). Similarly, antimiR-222 inhibitor treatment significantly decreased cell
proliferation of NSCLC A549 cells, whereas miR-222
precursor significantly increased cell proliferation of
BEAS-2B, the immortal normal bronchial epithelial
cells (Figure 2C and 2D). Cell migration was analyzed
using Transwell assay. The result showed that cell
migration was decreased by more than 2-fold in As-T
cells transfected with anti-miR-222 inhibitor (Figure 2E).
The tube formation was also significantly decreased by
anti-miR-222 inhibitor treatment (Figure 2F). Finally, to
further investigate the role of miR-222 in tumor growth

RESULTS
miR-222 expression is upregulated in As-T cells
Abnormal expression of miRNAs in tumors is
an important feature of tumor development. Our result
showed that miR-222 expression was upregulated the most
in As-T cells using miRNA microarray analysis (data not
shown). Similar results were confirmed using RT-PCR
and RT-qPCR analysis, showing 4-fold higher levels of
miR-222 in As-T cells than in B2B cells (Figure 1A and 1B).

Figure 1: miR-222 expression is upregulated in As-T cells. The expression levels of miR-222 were determined using RT-PCR

(A) and RT-qPCR (B) in As-T cells and BEAS-2B (B2B) cells. The expression levels of miR-222 were normalized to U6 snRNA levels.

miR-222 directly targets PTEN for inhibiting its
expression

in vivo, ectopic transplantation model of As-T cells in
nude mice was employed. Stable cell lines, As-T/AntimiR-NC and As-T/Anti-miR-222 cells were obtained and
subcutaneously injected into posterior blanks of BALB/c
nude mice, respectively. Each group includes ten mice.
Tumor volumes were monitored twice per week when
the tumors are visible. Compared to the control group,
the tumor volume of anti-miR-222 inhibitor group was
significantly smaller by Week 2 (P < 0.05, Figure 3A).
Nude mice were sacrificed four weeks after implantation,
and xenografts were trimmed out. The tumor sizes of antimiR-222 inhibitor group were much smaller than that of
control group (Figure 3B, top). Consistent with tumor
size, the tumor weight of anti-miR-222 inhibitor group
was decreased to 30% of control group (Figure 6B, tmiR222 levels in As-T cells is sufficient to attenuate tumor
growth in vivo.

It has been reported that PTEN is a target of miR-122
[9]. To verify whether miR-222 directly targets PTEN,
PTEN 3′-UTR sequences containing putative binding
sites of wild type (WT) or the mutant one (mut) were
cloned into pMIR-REPORTER vector. As-T cells were
cotransfected with reporter plasmid (PTEN-WT or
PTEN-mut) and miR-222 precursor or negative control
(miR-NC). Luciferase assay showed that the luciferase
activities of wild type PTEN 3′-UTR reporter were
inhibited by 35% in As-T cells over-expressing miR-222.
On the opposite, inhibition of miR-222 by its inhibitor
increased the luciferase activities of wild type reporter
by nearly 50% in As-T cells (Figure 4A and 4B). Neither
miR-222 nor miR-222 inhibitor affected the luciferase
activities of mutant reporters. This result suggests

that miR-222 inhibits PTEN expression through the
seed sequence at its 3′-UTR region. Further study by
immunoblotting assay showed that forced expression of
miR-222 greatly inhibited the expression levels of PTEN,
while blockade of endogenous expression of miR-222
upregulated PTEN levels for decreasing downstream
signaling molecule activation of PTEN: p-AKT, p-ERK,
and VEGF levels (Figure 4C).

both As-T and A549 cells (Figure 5D and 5E).
We found that As-T cells have much lower levels of
ARID1A protein compared to BEAS-2B cells (Figure 6A).
To test the effect of miR-222 in affecting ARID1A
protein expression, we showed that miR-222 mimics
markedly reduced ARID1A protein levels in both As-T
cells and BEAS-2B cells using Western blotting analysis
(Figure 6B and 6C), while anti-miR-222 inhibitor greatly
increased ARID1A protein expression in both cells
(Figures 6D and 5E).

Furthermore, we used software to predict
the potential targets of miR-222 and found that
ARID1A was one of the putative targets of miR-222.
The seed sequence of miR-222 matched 3′-UTR
region of ARID1A. We constructed luciferase reporter
plasmids containing the putative wild-type binding
sites (WT) and seed sequence mutant sites (mut)
at 3′-UTR of ARID1A (Figure 5A) and verified
by sequencing. Mimics of miR-222 significantly
inhibited the luciferase activity of wild-type ARID1A
3′-UTR reporter in As-T cells and BEAS-2B cells,
but did not affect that of ARID1A 3’-UTR mutant
reporter with the mutant binding site (Figure 5B
and 5C). In the parallel experiment, inhibition of
miR-222 using anti-miR-222 inhibitor increased the

AKT is a known anti-apoptosis protein. As-T
cells were transfected using anti-miR-222 inhibitor with
or without ARID1A siRNAs. AKT activation (p-AKT
level) is inhibited by anti-miR-222 inhibitor (Figure 7A).
The ARID1A siRNAs restored p-AKT level which was
reduced by anti-miR-222 inhibitor (Figure 7A). AntimiR-222 inhibitor treatment significantly induced apoptosis,
while the knockdown of ARID1A using the siRNAs reversed
the effect of anti-miR-222 inhibitor in the cells (Figure 7B).

DISCUSSION

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Arsenic induces human cancers including lung
cancer [19]. Recent studies have focused on arsenicinduced genetic changes, reactive oxygen species, and
epigenetic alterations [20–24]. It was reported that arsenic
affects the expression of certain miRNAs [15]. Increasing
evidences indicate that abnormal expression of miRNAs is
associated with carcinogenesis [25, 26]. In this study, we
focus on the role and mechanism of miR-222 in mediating
tumorigenesis using transformed cells through chronic
arsenite exposure.
It was reported that the reduction of miR-222
expression inhibited cell proliferation and induced
mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis of A549 lung cancer
and MCF-7 breast cancer cells [27]. As an oncogene, miR222 increased cell migration and invasion of hepatocellular
carcinoma [28]. The results of the present study found that
miR-222 inhibitor inhibited cell proliferation, migration,
and tumor growth, indicating that miR-222 plays an
important role in tumor development.
It was found that miR-222 induced gastric
carcinoma cell proliferation and radioresistance by
targeting PTEN [9]. The tumor suppressor PTEN is a
phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phosphatase that regulates
the activation of AKT via PtdIns 3 kinase (PI3K) to
regulate cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis
[29–31]. Upregulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
is involved in the tumorigenesis of ovarian clear cell
carcinoma [32], vulvar cancer [33], and other cancers
particularly through mutations and inactivation of PTEN.
In this study, we found that miR-222 directly targets
PTEN for inducing the activation of its downstream
molecules AKT and ERK in arsenic-transformed cells. In
addition, we found that ARID1A is a new direct target
of miR-222. ARID1A is a subunit of the SWItch/sucrose
nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling
complex. It has been found that low expression of the
ARID1A protein occurs in high frequency in many
cancers and considered as a bona fide tumor suppressor
[32, 34]. Loss of ARID1A protein expression is frequently
associated with PI3K/AKT pathway activation by
which to promote the development of cancer, especially
endometriosis-associated ovarian cancers [35]. In this
study, we found anti-miR-222 inhibitor treatment in cells
suppressed AKT activation and induced apoptosis through
ARID1A expression in As-T cells. These results indicate
that miR-222 and its novel target ARID1A play an
important role in tumor growth and apoptosis, which will
be helpful for understanding new mechanism of arsenic in
inducing carcinogenesis and for developing new treatment
option for cancer(s).

Cell culture and generation of stable cell lines

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B (BEAS-2B)
cells were transformed into arsenic-transformed cells
(As-T) by exposing BEAS-2B cells to 1 µM sodium
arsenic for 26 weeks as we previously described [17].
BEAS-2B cells were cultured for 26 weeks as passagematched cells (named as B2B). BEAS-2B and arsenic
transformed (As-T) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC,
purchased from ATCC, USA) were cultured in endothelial
basal medium-2 complete medium. As-T cells stably
overexpressing miR-222 inhibitor or anti-miR-control
were generated by infecting As-T cells with lentivirus
carrying miR-222 inhibitor and green fluorescence
protein (GFP) or a negative control miRNA precursor and
GFP (purchased from Shanghai Genechem Co., China),
followed by the selection with puromycin.

Isolation of total RNAs, RT-PCR, and qRT-PCR
analysis
Total RNAs were extracted from cultured cells using TRIzol
reagent (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. To measure the expression levels of
miR-222, total RNAs were transcribed by stem-loop reverse
transcription (RT) primer using PrimeScript RT Reagent
Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed using
PCR Mix (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and SYBR Premix DimerEraser (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) on Bio-Rad PTC-200
and ABI 7900HT system using the protocol provided by TaKaRa. U6 levels were used as an internal control. The primers are listed as followed: miR-222-StemLoop-RT primers,
5′-GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACGAGACC-3′; miR-222 qPCR primers: sense, 5′-AGCTACATCTGG CTACTGG-3′, antisense:

5′-AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT-3′; U6 qPCR primers: Sense, 5′-CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA-3′, antisense,
5′-TGGTGTCGTGGAGTCG-3′.

Cell proliferation assay
Cells at 1000 per well were seeded onto a 96-well
plate and incubated at 37°C in 10% Cell Counting Kit-8
(Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) diluted in DMEM. Cell
proliferation rates were determined at 12, 24, 48, 72, 96,
and 120 h after transplantation.

Tube formation assay

ase activities were normalized to firefly luciferase activities for transfection efficiency 48 h after the transfection.

Tube formation assay (angiogenesis assay in vitro)
was performed as we previously described [17].

Western blotting analysis

Transwell migration assay

The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS
buffer, and total protein lysates were prepared using
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with
protease inhibitors (Beyotime, Nantong, China). Aliquots
of protein lysates (30 μg) were electrophoresed on 8% (for
ARID1A) or 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gels (for other proteins), and transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane (Roche, Switzerland). Next, the membranes
were incubated with primary antibodies purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA) overnight
at 4°C, then with the appropriate horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactivity signals
were visualized using chemiluminescence detection
reagent and imaged.

Transwell chambers (BD Biosciences, Bedford,
MA) with 8-µM pore size PET membrane were inserted
into 24-well plates. About 5 × 104 cells per well in
DMEM without serum were seeded onto each upper
well of transwell chambers, while the medium with
10% FBS as a chemoattractant was added to the lower
chamber. Following incubation for 24 h at 37°C, cells
that did not migrate through the membrane were removed
using a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated through the
membrane were fixed with 20% methanol and stained
with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA),
imaged, and counted.

Tumor formation experiment

Apoptosis assay by flow cytometry

Ten 5- to 6-week-old BALB/c nude mice per group
were subcutaneously injected with 5 × 106 As-T cells
infected with lentiviruses carrying miR-NC or miR-222
inhibitor in special pathogen-free conditions. Tumor sizes
were measured twice every week using Vernier caliper
after they were visible. Tumor volumes were calculated
according to the formula 0.5 × length × width2 [18].

Apoptosis of cells was assessed using Annexin
V-FITC apoptosis kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (BD Pharmingen, USA). The cells were
then analyzed using flow cytometer (FACSCanto II, BD
Biosciences) after the cells were stained with anti-Annexin
V-FITC antibody. The data were analyzed using FlowJo
software. Three experiments were performed in triplicate.

[9]. The 3′-UTR region of AT-rich interactive domain 1A
(ARID1A) was amplified using PCR from cDNAs derived
from As-T cells, and inserted into pMIR-REPORTER
vector (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Primers
for wild-type or mutant reporter constructs are listed as

24-well plates for 12 h before the transfection. As-T cells
were transiently cotransfected with 300 ng of wild type
or mutant PTEN-3′-UTR reporter, or 300 ng of wild type
or mutant ARID1A-3′-UTR reporter, 100 ng pGl4.74, and
20 nM miR-222 mimic or anti-miR-222 inhibitor using
