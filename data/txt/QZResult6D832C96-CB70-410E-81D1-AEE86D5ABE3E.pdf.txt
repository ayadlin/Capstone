BACKGROUND. This study investigated the role of magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) in evaluation of pathologically complete response and residual tumors in
patients who were receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for both positive
and negative HER-2 breast cancer.
METHODS. Fifty-one individuals, comprised of 25 HER-2 positive and 26 HER-2
negative patients, were included in the study. Serial MRI studies were acquired
before, during, and after NAC. On the basis of the final MRI, response was determined to be a clinically complete response ([CCR], no enhancement), probable
CCR (residual enhancement equal to or less than that of glandular tissue), or re-

RESULTS. Complete clinical response as seen through MRI, including CCR and
probable CCR, was identified in 35 (35 of 51, 69%) patients. MRI correctly diagnosed pCR in 26 (26 of 35, 74%) patients, including 18 of 19 (95%) patients in the
HER-2 positive group and 8 of 16 (50%) patients in the HER-2 negative group
(P < .005). The accuracy of MRI in identifying pCR varied according to the chemotherapy agent that was administered. MRI was more accurate in identifying pCR
in patients who were receiving trastuzumab and less accurate in patients receiving bevacizumab. The high false-negative rate found in HER-2 negative patients
was associated with residual disease that presented as scattered cells or small
foci. In cases with residual bulk tumor, the lesion size, determined by MRI, correlated highly with that found in histopathological measurements (r 5 0.93).

CONCLUSIONS. MRI may predict pCR with high accuracy in HER-2 positive
patients, but it has a high false-negative rate in HER-2 negative patients, particularly in patients who are receiving antiangiogenic agents. Results indicate that
the chemotherapy agent should be taken into consideration when using MRI to
interpret therapeutic outcomes. More studies are needed to establish the role of

he traditional clinical role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is
to down-stage inoperable cancers to render them operable or to
facilitate improved outcomes in breast conservation surgery.1,2 With
evidence of improved survival for patients who achieved a pathologically complete response (pCR) after NAC,3 NAC has received attention as a treatment option for management of breast cancer.

Pathologically complete response (pCR) rates have
varied widely according to chemotherapy regimens;
eg, 13% of patients treated with an anthracyclinebased regimen (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide),1
and 26% of patients who in addition received the second-line regimen of partially noncross-resistant
agents such as taxane had a pCR.2 There was a statistically significant correlation between pathologically
complete response and both overall survival and disease-free survival.4–8 Therefore, for patients who are
receiving NAC, pCR is the most relevant prognostic
factor.
Noting this emerging development, the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) organized a conference entitled
‘‘Preoperative Therapy in Invasive Breast Cancer,’’
from March 26–27, 2007, to discuss critical research
into the potential role of NAC in managing breast
cancer. Breast imaging, especially MRI, is identified as
one such research area. Although the role of MRI for
preoperative surgical planning and high-risk screening is well established,9–15 MRI application in the setting of NAC remains to be investigated.
The advantage of MRI over other modalities,
including mammography, ultrasound, and palpation
for monitoring response after NAC has been widely
reported.16–18 Mammography involves radiation, and,
therefore, frequently repeating mammograms during
NAC for monitoring responses is not acceptable. Previous MRI studies have focused on bulk residual disease, showing that dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
(DCE-MRI) can provide clear tumor delineation and
is the most accurate imaging modality to predict residual tumor size after NAC.16–22 However, with the
more aggressive NAC protocol, a higher rate of pCR
(no invasive cancer) and minimum tumor burden
(no bulk tumor) has been found. Therefore, for
patients who are receiving an aggressive NAC protocol, the use of MRI to predict pCR and residual minimum disease should be investigated.
At our institute, we have been conducting clinical
trials that use a protocol comprised of first-line
anthracycline-based and second-line taxane-based
chemotherapy regimens that have proven to achieve a
high pCR rate relative to other published results.23
HER-2 positive cancer is aggressive and, in the past,
has been considered an unfavorable prognostic biomarker. However, with the availability and effectiveness of trastuzumab (Herceptin), a targeted treatment,
HER-2 has become a favorable biomarker.24 Our
second-line regimen for HER-2 positive cancer also
contained trastuzumab, another drug that has been
proven to achieve a high pCR rate. For HER-2 negative
cancer, the pCR rate is much lower. Yet, because of the
promising efficacy of the antiangiogenic agent bevaci-

zumab (Avastin) for lung and metastatic breast cancer,
we added this drug to the second-line taxane regimen
for HER-2 negative patients. Because bevacizumab
acts on blood vessels, it may impede the delivery of
MR contrast agent and, thereby, limit the ability of
DCE-MRI to detect residual disease.
The objective of this study was to investigate the
role of breast MRI in the evaluation of NAC outcome
by correlating MR imaging findings with histopathology at post-NAC surgery. We were particularly interested in comparing the predictive accuracy of pCR
with that of minimal residual disease when no residual tumor was detected on MRI. This may provide
useful information for establishing the future clinical
role of MRI in surgical planning after NAC. Our analysis was also categorized by HER-2 positive and negative status and by different chemotherapy regimens.
Because it is known that pCR is less likely to be
achieved in HER-2 negative patients compared with
HER-2 positive patients, the predictive accuracy in
these 2 groups was evaluated separately. Lastly, we
also investigated the predictive accuracy in patients
who also received bevacizumab, because the agent
may possibly compromise DCE-MRI detection of residual disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Fifty-one patients enrolled from July 2003 to April
2006 were included in this study. Selection criteria
allowed patients who were enrolled into the treatment trial with biopsy-proven invasive cancer, who
also had received serial MRI studies before and during therapy, and who had had their last MRI performed before surgery. They had lesions either >5
cm or <5 cm and also had lymph node involvement
clinically documented by palpation. Twenty-five
patients were HER-2 positive with an age range of 32
to 77 years old (mean, 51 years). Twenty-six patients
were HER-2 negative, with an age range of 31 to 69
years old (mean, 48 years; P 5 .142). The pretreatment tumor size ranged from 0.9 cm to 8.5 cm (median, 2.4 cm). The clinical stages were stage II
(n 5 19), stage III (n 5 18), and stage IV (n 5 14).
Three patients had infiltrating lobular carcinoma (1
HER-2 positive and 2 HER-2 negative); the other 48
patients had invasive ductal carcinoma. The duration
from last MRI to surgery was 6–90 days (mean, 38
days) in HER-2 positive patients and 20–64 days
(mean, 40 days) in HER-2 negative patients (P 5 .65).
This study was approved by an institutional
review board and complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). All

patients gave written informed consent for NAC
treatment, MRI, and participation in this study.

Treatment Protocol and MRI Follow-up
All patients received biweekly doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cyclophosphamide (AC) as their first-line
regimen. After the first 2 cycles, an oncologist evaluated patient response using all information available
at that time (clinical examination, patient’s tolerance,
sonography, etc), and the oncologist decided whether
the patient should continue to receive 2 additional
cycles of AC or should be switched to a taxane-based
regimen. The second-line taxane-based regimen comprised paclitaxel (Taxol-T) or Nab-paclitaxel (AbraxaneAb, a new formulation of albumin-bound nanoparticle of paclitaxel), combined with carboplatin(Ca).
HER-2 positive patients also received trastuzumab
(Herceptin-H). Some HER-2 negative patients also
received bevacizumab (Avastin-Av). Table 1 summarizes these different regimens and the number of
patients in each group.
All patients had pretreatment baseline breast MRI
exams, at least 2 follow-up examinations during the
course of therapy, and a final examination after completion of the therapy protocol. After NAC, a definitive
surgery was performed. Twenty-five patients received
lumpectomy, and 26 received mastectomy. The type
of surgery was decided on the basis of the surgeon’s
recommendation and the patient’s personal choice.
Pathological Examination
Surgical specimens were cut into 5 mm slices, fixed in
10% neutral-buffered formalin, and processed for histological examination. If gross tumor was evident,
each paraffin block containing the tumor was sliced
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for
evaluation. If no gross tumor was found, the tissue
marker left in the breast was identified, and slides
from the block containing the marker as well as the
adjacent blocks were examined. Residual disease

post-NAC was recorded into 1 of 3 categories, 1) no
residual malignancy, no sign of cancer cells; 2) no residual invasive cancer, DCIS present; 3) residual invasive cancer. Defined as no invasive cancer present,
pCR included categories 1 and 2. This definition is
used at M. D. Anderson (Houston, Tx)25 and also at
the NCI March 26–27, 2007 conference entitled ‘‘Preoperative Therapy in Invasive Breast Cancer’’. In cases
with residual invasive cancer, the pathological size
was determined as the longest dimension, either the
longest dimension on 1 H&E-stained slide or from the
number of blocks (each 5 mm) where the malignant
invasive tumor was detected, whichever was greater.

MRI Acquisition
The MRI examination was performed by a 1.5 Tesla
MR scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, Oh)
with a dedicated 4-channel, phased-array, breast coil
(manufactured by USA Instruments, Aurora, Oh). The
imaging protocol consisted of high-resolution precontrast imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced
imaging. After a scout scan, sagittal, unilateral T1weighted, precontrast images were acquired. After
this, a 3D Spoiled Gradient Recalled (SPGR) pulse
sequence with 16 frames, including 4 precontrast
and 12 postcontrast sets, was prescribed for axial,
bilateral, dynamic imaging (TR 5 8.1 ms, TE 5 4.0
ms, flip angle 5 208, slice thickness 5 4 mm, matrix
size 5 256 by 128, field of view [FOV] 5 32–38 cm).
The scan time was 42 seconds per acquisition. Gadodiamide (Omniscan; GE, Fairfield, Conn, doing business as General Electric Healthcare, headquartered in
the UK) contrast agent was injected (1 cc/10 lbs
body weight) at the beginning of the fifth acquisition
followed by 10 cc saline for flushing.
Interpretation of MRI
After the study was completed, all images were transferred to a personal computer for processing and
interpretation. Subtraction images were obtained by

is shown. Top left to right shows MIP pretreatment, second follow-up, and postNAC MRI studies. Bottom row shows color-coded images of MRI studies. Note
the gradual shrinkage of the tumor and eventual disappearance on the final MRI (not visible on MIP). MRI diagnosis was complete clinical response (CCR). Final
pathological examination did not reveal any malignancy; thus a pathologically complete response (pCR) was realized.

treatment is shown. Top row shows MIP pretreatment, second follow-up, and the postNAC final MRI. Bottom row shows color-coded images in these MRI studies. Note the large heterogeneously enhanced tumor in the left breast before treatment and the subsequent marked shrinkage of tumor. There was notable
enhancement of the cancer site on MIP, but the post-treatment intensity was only comparable to that of glandular tissues elsewhere. As a result, this case was
designated as a probable CCR. Final pathology did not reveal any malignancy; thus pCR was achieved.

subtracting the precontrast images acquired in
Frame 3 from the 1-minute postcontrast enhanced
images acquired in Frame 6, and then maximum intensity projections (MIPs) were generated from these
subtraction images. The subtraction images were
also color coded, representing different degrees of
enhancement. Examples from 4 patients demonstrating MIPs and color-coded images before, during, and
after NAC are shown in Figures 1–4. On the basis of
the computer-generated MIP, 1 radiologist (J.C.), with
2 years of experience in interpreting breast MRI, performed the size measurement. Two lines were drawn
(the longest dimension and the longest perpendicular dimension) to obtain the 2-dimensional sizes.
When the enhancement was low on MIP, the corresponding color-enhanced subtraction images were
used. The shape of the tumor may change depending
on how the breast is positioned within the coil. In
one study, the tumor may be round, and in another
study, it may be elongated. Therefore, the 2-dimensional size was measured and then converted to 1
dimension (by calculating the square root of the

area), and this was used to correlate with pathological size.
The tumor size of each patient in all serial MRI
studies (pretreatment and all follow-up) was analyzed in one sitting by the radiologist to ensure consistent determination of the tumor boundary. The
radiologist was blinded to the pathology results. If
the 1-dimenional size reduction after completing
NAC was <30% compared with the pretreatment
size, the case was classified as a nonresponder (NR).
When residual tumor was present with >30% size reduction, the case was classified as a partial response
(PR). Cases in which no enhanced tissues were visible were classified as clinically complete responses
(CCRs). When minimal enhancement was found at
the previous lesion site with weaker or comparable
enhancement relative to normal glandular tissue (ipsilateral or contralateral), the case was classified as
probable CCR. Both CCR and probable CCR were
considered to be a complete response determined by
MRI (noted as MR-CR) and MR-CR was used to evaluate the accuracy of MRI in prediction of pCR.

Top row shows MIP from pretreatment, second follow-up, and the final post-NAC MRI. Bottom row shows colorcoded images of these serial MRI studies. Note that after being treated with the first-line regimen, the tumor did not appear to shrink on the first follow-up
MRI but appeared to respond after switching to the second-line regimen. One 4-mm enhancing lesion was detected by MRI and was diagnosed as residual disease. However, histopathology showed DCIS, which is considered pCR by definition. Thus, this is a false-positive case by MRI.

Statistical Analysis
A Fisher exact test was performed to compare pCR
rates between groups. A 2-tailed chi-square test was
used for comparison of lymph node status. A 2-tailed
Student t test was used to compare difference of age
and duration from the last MRI to surgery between
HER2 groups. A Pearson correlation was used for
comparing MRI-determined residual tumor size and
pathological size. P < .05 was considered significant.

RESULTS
Surgical Types Between HER-2 Positive and HER-2
Negative Patients
In the HER-2 positive group, 13 patients received
mastectomy, and 12 had lumpectomy. In the HER-2
negative group, 12 patients received mastectomy, 13
had lumpectomy, and 1 patient had initial lumpectomy followed by mastectomy. The choice of lumpectomy in these 2 groups was not statistically
different (12 of 25 vs 13 of 26; P 5 1).

MR-CR and pCR in Patients Receiving Different
Chemotherapy Regimens
The MR prediction accuracy of pCR in different drug
groups is summarized in Table 1. Overall, there was
no significant difference for MRI-determined complete response (MR-CR) in different groups. The pCR
prediction accuracy in HER-2 positive patients was
93% (13 of 14) in the Taxol, Carboplatin, Herceptin
(TCaH) group and 100% (5 of 5) in the Abraxane,
Carboplatin, Herceptin (AbCaH) group, which was
higher than that of 58% (7 of 12) in the Taxol, Carboplatin (TCa) group and 25% (1 of 4) in the Abraxane,
Carboplatin, Avastin (AbCaAv) group of HER-2 negative patients. It was noted that the pCR rate was the
lowest in the group receiving bevacizumab (Avastin),
only 25%.

in Table 2. A pathologically complete response was
achieved in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Of these, 22
patients showed no evidence of malignant cells, and
6 (4 HER-2 positive and 2 HER-2 negative) patients
showed DCIS without an invasive component. The
overall pCR rate was higher, 19 of 25 (76%), in the
HER-2 positive group compared with 9 of 26 (35%)
in the HER-2 negative group (P < .005). MRI diagnosed complete clinical response (MR-CR) in 35 of
51 (69%) patients, including 28 patients without any
enhanced lesions (CCR) and 7 patients with very
mild enhancements defined as probable CCR.

Diagnostic Accuracy of MRI
The diagnostic accuracy of MRI, including true-negative (ie, accurate prediction of pCR), true-positive,
false-negative, and false-positive rates are summarized in Table 3. Of the 35 MR-CR cases, MRI correctly
diagnosed 74% (26 of 35) pCR. Among these, pCR prediction accuracy was much higher, 95% (18 of 19), in
the HER-2 positive group compared with 50% (8 of
16) in the HER-2 negative group (P < .005). Figure 1
demonstrates 1 patient diagnosed by MRI as CCR,
who had confirmed pCR. Of the 7 probable CCRs,
71% (5 of 7) were proven to have pCR, and 29% (2 of
7) had residual invasive cancer. Figure 2 shows images
from 1 patient who had confirmed pCR that was diagnosed by MRI as probable CCR. MRI showed a falsenegative diagnosis in 26% (9 of 35) patients, 8 in the
HER-2 negative group and 1 in the HER-2 positive
group. Figure 3 shows images from 1 patient who was
diagnosed by MRI as CCR but who also had residual
invasive cancer presenting as 3 small foci of 1.5 mm.
Lastly, MRI showed a false-positive diagnosis in 2
patients, 1 HER-2 positive and 1 HER-2 negative. Figure 4 presents images from 1 patient who had a
4-mm residual tumor on MRI with DCIS on pathology. This case is considered pCR by definition, and it
is, thereby, a false-positive case.
The 9 false-negative cases (1 HER-2 positive and 8
HER-2 negative) were likely due to residual disease

present as scattered invasive cancer cells or foci smaller than 3 mm in size. Our MRI did not detect such
residual enhancement, and it did not provide a correct
diagnosis. In our study, this pattern of residual disease
occurred more frequently in HER-2 negative patients.
In addition to false-negative cases, we had 2
false-positive cases. One had MRI enhancement in a
region of DCIS (Fig. 4). The other false-positive MRI
showed a 1-cm enhanced lesion, but pathological examination of the mastectomy specimen did not find
any evidence of malignancy. As the specimen has
since been discarded, the corresponding area could
not be examined to verify the histopathology finding.

Correlation of Residual Tumor Size Determined on MRI
Versus Pathology
Sixteen cases of residual cancer detected by MRI
included 15 partial responders and 1 nonresponder,
as shown in Table 2. MRI residual-lesion size was in
the range of 0.4 cm to 3.7 cm, and the pathological
size was 0.4 cm to 6.0 cm. A Pearson linear regression was used to correlate MRI and pathological size
after we excluded 1 outlier. On MRI, a patient with
lobular cancer had a 0.5-cm residual tumor, but this
patient actually had scattered residual cancer cells
distributed throughout a 6.0-cm region by histopathology. This case, again, demonstrates the limitation
of MRI in detecting scattered cancer cells. After
excluding this case, the remaining 15 cases correlating MRI and pathological size showed a Pearson correlation coefficient of r 5 0.93; P < .000001.
Axillary Lymph Node Status
Axillary lymph node dissection was performed in 16
of 25 HER-2 positive patients and in 17 of 26 HER-2
negative patients. The pathological examination
found positive lymph nodes in 4 of 16 HER-2 positive
patients and in 9 of 17 HER-2 negative patients, a
finding that was not statistically different (P 5 .15).
Of the 4 HER-2 positive patients, 1 was pCR, and 3
did not achieve pCR. Of the 9 HER-2 negative
patients, 2 were pCR, and 7 were non-pCR.

DISCUSSION
The final outcome after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
was evaluated on the basis of pathological findings.
Achieving pathologically complete response (pCR) is
considered the ultimate goal for a favorable prognosis.3–8 Factors that are significant predictors of
pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
include mitotic index, histological grade, HER-2, Ki67,
p53, S-phase fraction, and hormone-receptor status.26–28 High rates of pathologically complete remission were associated with absence of estrogenreceptor and progesterone-receptor expression.29
Because of the small number of cases in this study,
we could not perform a multivariate analysis to evaluate all these biomarkers. By using trastuzumab (Herceptin) as a targeted therapy for HER-2, we found a
statistically significantly higher pCR rate in HER-2
positive patients. Nineteen of 25 (76%) HER-2 positive
patients and 9 of 26 (35%) HER-2 negative patients
achieved pCR. Therefore, HER-2 positive breast cancer has become a favorable response predictor. In
evaluating patients who were receiving anthracyclinebased neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we found the pCR
rate to be very low, ranging from 3% to 28%, in published reports.28,30,31 With this chemotherapy regimen, overexpression of HER-2 was not predictive of
pathological response. This contradiction was likely
due to the finding that trastuzumab was not yet available at that time.
The success of trastuzumab in treatment of HER2 positive breast cancer has led to its widespread use,
and it is becoming the current clinical standard. The
combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy has
been found to be significantly superior to chemotherapy alone in terms of both response rate and survival.32 In addition, the combination of trastuzumab,
which targets the HER-2 positive cells, and anthracycline, which targets topoisomerase alpha II coamplified cancer cells, has been shown to be synergistic.33
The NAC treatment protocol described in this study
has been used at our institution since 2003. Although
it achieved a high pCR rate in HER-2 positive patients,
it had a much lower pCR in HER-2 negative
patients.23 In late 2005, with the intention to improve
the pCR, bevacizumab (Avastin-Av) was added to the
treatment regimen of HER-2 negative patients. Bevacizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody that
binds and inactivates all isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to inhibit angiogenesis as
well as tumor growth and proliferation. In animal
models, administration of bevacizumab blocked the
growth of human tumor xenografts and reduced both
the size and number of metastases.34 Bevacizumab
exerts its effect through several potential mechan-

23

isms, including inhibition and regression of new tumor vessel growth, alteration of vascular function and
tumor blood flow (‘‘normalization’’), and direct
impact upon tumor cells.35 Although the efficacy of
bevacizumab in breast cancer needs further evaluation, preliminary results from a large, randomized,
clinical trial for patients with previously untreated
recurrent or metastatic breast carcinoma conducted
by a network of researchers led by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) has shown that those
patients who received bevacizumab in combination
with standard chemotherapy had a longer tumor-free
period than patients who received the same chemotherapy without bevacizumab.
Although research on the accuracy of MR imaging
in predicting pCR has been previously published, prediction rates related to HER-2 status have not
addressed.21,22,36,37 In this study, MRI correctly
detected 74% (26 of 35) pCR, including 95% (18 of 19)
in the HER-2 positive group and 50% (8 of 16) in the
HER-2 negative group (P < .005). MRI had false-negative diagnoses in 26% (9 of 35) of patients (1 HER-2
positive and 8 HER-2 negative), and false-positive
diagnoses in 2 patients (1 HER-2 positive and 1 HER-2
negative). The overall accuracy was higher for HER-2
positive patients. The large number of false-negatives
in HER-2 negative patients was due to presentation
of residual disease as scattered cells or small foci
(<3 mm), which made MRI diagnosis very difficult,
and these lesions were missed on MRI because of the
lack of enhancement. This finding suggests that interpretation of residual disease on MRI may need to be
more conservative for HER-2 negative patients.
We also found that the predictive accuracy of
pCR by MRI in patients who received bevacizumab
(Avastin) was the lowest of all treatment-regimen
groups. The predictive accuracy in the bevacizumabcontaining group (AbCaAv) was only 25% (1 of 4),
which was significantly lower compared with 93%
(13 of 14) for TCaH (P < .01) or 100% (5 of 5) for
AbCaH (P < .025), lower but not statistically significant compared with 58% (7 of 12) for TCa. This was
probably because of the reduced tumor vascularity
associated with bevacizumab treatment and decreased enhancement of residual cancer.
Regarding the role of MRI for evaluating residual
tumor size, our result was in accordance with other
studies,38–41 showing agreement of MRI and histopathology (r 5 0.93). In our study, 1 lobular cancer was
an outlier, showing a 0.5-cm residual lesion on MRI
but a 6-cm region of scattered cancer cells on pathology. This case suffered from the same limitation
of MRI as other false-negative cases, reflecting the
difficulty of MRI in detecting this pattern of residual

cancer after NAC. If conservative surgery had been
recommended on the basis of the MRI that showed
0.5-cm residual disease, the patient would have had
positive margins and inadequate treatment. As more
studies become available, the detection of residual
cancer by MRI after NAC may be helpful in creating
guidelines for surgical planning as identified as critically needed research at the March 2007 NCI conference. The current standard of care includes a
definitive surgery after NAC. Our findings may suggest that 1) a complete response on MRI in HER-2
positive patients is very reliable; thus MRI can be
used for planning a lumpectomy; 2) when bulk residual disease is detected, an appropriate surgery can
be planned on the basis of the detected tumor size;
and 3) for HER-2 negative patients with minimal residual disease shown on MRI, lumpectomy can be
planned, but margins need to be carefully examined.
In addition to the response of a primary tumor,
we also investigated the lymph node status in
patients who received axillary lymph node dissection.42 The pathological response of both primary tumor and lymph nodes has been shown to have a
significant impact on prognosis and long-term outcome in patients with locally advanced breast carcinoma.7,42 Even if pCR of the primary tumor is
achieved, lymph node metastasis indicates a substantial risk of cancer recurrence.7,8 Positive lymph
nodes were found in 4 of 16 HER-2 positive patients
who received axillary lymph node dissection. Of
these 4 (of 16 dissections), 1 achieved pCR in the primary tumor, and 3 did not achieve pCR. Positive
nodes were found in 9 (2 pCR and 7 non-pCR) of 17
HER-2 negative patients. Therefore, HER-2 negative
patients were more likely to have positive nodes
compared with their HER-2 positive cohort; and
non-pCR patients were more likely to have positive
nodes compared with pCR patients. Because of the
small number of cases, the comparison did not reach
the significance level. Further studies are needed to
evaluate the association of HER-2 status and primary
pCR with lymph node response.
Several grading classifications are used to assess
pathological responses after NAC. The most debatable issue is whether DCIS should be considered as
pCR. Because of a lack of universally accepted pathological response criteria, the definition of pCR should
be noted when comparing results of post-NAC published studies.3 A study at the M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center (Houston, Tx) showed that, with a median
follow-up of 61 months, there was no statistical difference in disease-free survival in those with DCIS
only and in those with no residual invasive or in situ
disease. There was also no significant difference in

5-year overall survival between these 2 groups of
patients.25 This inclusion of DCIS in the pCR group
was the consensus of the NCI conference, March
2007. However, although the impact of DCIS may be
negligible with regard to prognosis, it may be an important risk factor for local recurrence after breast
conservation therapy.43 With the cases in this study,
we will be able to separately follow patients with and
without DCIS in the future.
Several limitations existed in our study. Only
patients receiving the chemotherapy regimens of our
particular clinical trial that including anthracycline
and taxane-based regimens were studied. Because
different chemotherapy regimens may affect tumor
detection by MRI, results may not be generalizable.
The spatial resolution of the MRI images used in this
study was suboptimal, which limited the ability to
detect small tumor foci. The relatively low spatial resolution was selected in 2002 to cover the whole
breast and also to have a temporal resolution of 42
seconds, which was critical in the analysis of our
enhancement kinetics (not presented in this study).
Even with an MRI system upgrade, we chose to alter
the protocol so that results would be comparable.
We have moved the study to a 3.0-Tesla scanner, and
our current protocol has improved spatial resolution
as well as fat suppression. Postcontrast enhanced
images can now be directly evaluated without subtraction, and they are, thus, less prone to motion
problems. One major difficulty in breast MRI is to
spatially correlate MRI findings with pathological
findings. Although MRI-guided biopsy has become
available, it is much more complicated compared
with mammography or ultrasound-guided biopsy;
thus it is not widely used. Furthermore, a biopsy after NAC before definitive surgery may not be clinically justified. In this study, we took advantage of
serial MRI studies to follow gradual tumor response.
It would be very difficult to evaluate the final MRI by
referencing only the pretreatment study without the
intermediate follow-up studies.

Conclusion
In this study, we investigated the role of MRI in evaluating breast cancer response after NAC. Complete
response determined by MRI was highly correlated
to pCR in HER-2 positive patients, but complete
response had a high false-negative rate in HER-2
negative patients. The major difficulty was detecting
minimal residual disease that presented as scattered
cells or small foci, particularly in patients who were
receiving antiangiogenic agents. Conversely, in cases
with bulk disease, the tumor size determined on MRI
was highly correlated with pathological size. Our

MRI of Breast Cancer After NAC/Chen et al.

results suggest that detection of minimal residual
disease is difficult, especially in HER-2 negative
patients. More studies and long-term treatment outcomes are needed to establish the role of MRI in the
management of patients who are receiving NAC.
