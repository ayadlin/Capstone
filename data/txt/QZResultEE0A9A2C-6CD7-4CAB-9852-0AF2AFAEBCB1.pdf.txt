ABSTRACT
Biphasic malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the second most common
histotype of MPM. It is histologically characterized by the concomitant presence of
epithelioid and sarcomatoid features, the latter associated with worse prognosis.
In this report we describe that silencing of AKT1 in spindle-shaped biphasic MPM
cells promotes the shift toward an epithelioid phenotype. Furthermore, AKT1 silencing
resulted in decreased expression of the lactate/H+ symporter MCT4 and its chaperone
CD147/Basigin, and in the induction of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) expression. We
provide evidence that ERβ expression is induced by increased intracellular lactate
concentration. Spheroid culturing and tumor growth of ERβ negative biphasic MPM in
nude mice resulted in the induction of ERβ expression and response to the selective
agonist KB9520. In both models, the treatment with the ERβ agonist results in reduced
cell proliferation, decreased expression of MCT4 and CD147/Basigin and increased
acetylation and inactivation of AKT1. Collectively, in response to metabolic changes,
ERβ expression is induced and exerts an anti-tumor effect through selective agonist
activation. The possibility to reverse the more aggressive biphasic mesothelioma
histotype by targeting ERβ with a selective agonist could represent a new effective
treatment strategy.

on the ratio of epithelial to sarcomatoid cells. A tumor
composed mostly of epithelioid cells grows more slowly
and responds better to treatment [8, 9].
MPM is highly resistant to therapy and the
preferred treatments are surgery (at early stages) and/
or combinatorial treatments with radiotherapy and
chemotherapy [10]. Conventional therapy with cisplatin
and pemetrexed allows only palliation for the majority
of patients and the average survival time after diagnosis
remains poor [11–13]. There is, therefore, a pressing
need for advancement in the understanding of the disease
pathobiology and progression, and in the development of
more effective therapies.
The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is aberrantly active
and has an important biologic impact in MPM progression

INTRODUCTION
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly
aggressive cancer associated with asbestos exposure
[1–3]. More than 120 million people are estimated to be
exposed to asbestos worldwide and the incidence rate is
on average 0.1–3.3 per 100,000 individuals, with locally
higher incidence rates (5.8 per 100,000) [4–6].
MPM is divided into three histological categories
including epithelioid, biphasic and sarcomatoid.
Biphasic tumors are a mix of cube-like epithelial
cells and spindle-shaped sarcomatoid cells [7]. These
two cell types typically reside in separate areas of the
tumor, but they can also develop close together. How
well a biphasic tumor responds to treatment depends

and chemo-resistance [14–17]. Once activated, PI3K and its
downstream effector AKT1 not only provide strong growth
and survival signals to tumor cells, but also exert profound
effects on their metabolism [18].
In addition to intracellular signaling pathways, the
abnormal tumor microenvironment, characterized by
limited nutrient and oxygen supply, have a major role in
determining the metabolic phenotype of tumor cells. The
importance of metabolic restriction in cancer has often
been masked, due to the use of cell culture conditions in
which both oxygen and nutrients are always in excess. In
solid tumors, functionally abnormal vasculature combined
with altered tumor cell metabolism, creates spatial and
temporal heterogeneity in oxygenation, acidity and
concentration of metabolites. These extreme conditions
induce a collection of cellular stress responses that further
modulate the metabolic phenotype of tumor cells and
influence tumor progression [18].
It is well known that tumor hypoxia in some cases
promotes malignant progression, invasion and acquisition
of resistance to chemotherapy and radiation whereas
in other cases it inhibits cell proliferation and induces
differentiation, apoptosis or necrosis [19].
Under hypoxia, cancer cells develop an adaptive
metabolic response, activating glucose uptake and
glycolysis to produce pyruvate, which is subsequently
converted into lactate.
Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), also called
the solute carrier family 16 (SLC16), especially MCT1
(SLC16A1) and MCT4 (SLC16A3) and their chaperone
Basigin (also named CD147 and EMMPRIN) are crucial
in regulating lactate entry or export across the plasma
membrane and to decrease high intracellular lactate
levels resultant from glycolytic activity [20]. There
are controversial data on MCTs regulation by hypoxia,
some evidence points at hypoxia-mediated increase of
MCT4, but not MCT1, whereas other data indicate that
both MCT isoforms are regulated by hypoxia [21, 22].
Marked increases in the levels of MCT1 and/or MCT4 are
hallmarks of several human malignancies, and high levels
of these transporters connote poor outcome [23–26].
Low oxygen tension modulates cancer cell metabolism
through stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α
subunits (HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and HIF-3α) that in turn
translocate to the nucleus where they heterodimerize with
the constitutive HIF1-β, also referred to as aryl hydrocarbon
receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), and the recruitment
of cofactors [27]. The recruitment of ARNT is critical for the
HIF complex to bind to hypoxia-responsive elements (HRE)
on target genes and activation of their transcription. ARNT
has also been claimed to directly interact with estrogen
receptors (ERs) and has been shown to co-activate ERdependent gene expression [28]. It has been reported that
ERβ inhibits HIF-1α-mediated transcription by targeting
ARNT, via ubiquitination processes, which may in part
account for the tumor suppressive function of ERβ [29, 30].

Our group has recently demonstrated that ERβ
exerts a key role as a tumor-suppressor gene in MPM
[31]. We reported that MPM cell proliferation and tumor
growth can be effectively suppressed by selective agonist
activation of ERβ and that the growth inhibitory efficacy
is related to the level of ERβ expressed. Furthermore,
we recently described that activation of ERβ with the
selective agonist KB9520 increased the sensitivity of
MPM tumors to the cisplatin/pemetrexed combination,
providing evidence that drugs that selectively activate
ERβ might prove promising in the development of novel,
targeted therapies for the clinical management of human
MPM [32].
In the present study, we describe a role for lactate,
accumulated in hypoxic conditions, in the modulation of
ERβ expression in ERβ-null cells originally derived from
a patient with biphasic MPM. Moreover, we explore the
efficacy of the selective ERβ agonist KB9520 to suppress
biphasic malignant cell proliferation in vitro and tumor
growth in vivo.

RESULTS
AKT1 modulation in MPM cells affects ERβ
expression and cell metabolism
We recently published that MPM derived cell
lines express AKT1 and AKT3 but not AKT2 [17].
In this study we investigated the AKT1 isoformspecific functions in two MPM derived cell lines. We
transiently silenced AKT1 expression in MSTO-211H
(high expresser) and transiently overexpressed it in
REN (low expresser) cells. AKT1 silencing in MSTO211H cells resulted in an increase in intracellular lactate
content and a morphological shift toward an epithelioid
phenotype compared to cells transfected with nonspecific siRNAs (Figure 1A). In contrast, overexpressing
AKT1 in REN cells induced a more spindle-like
phenotype (Figure  1B). As shown in Figure 1C, ERβ
was significantly induced both at mRNA and protein
levels in AKT1 silenced MSTO-211H cells, whereas
ERβ expression was significantly inhibited by AKT1
overexpression in REN cells (Figure 1D). We recently
described the metabolic impact of ERβ expression and
agonist activation in MPM cells [33, 34]. In present
study, we observed that also AKT1 plays an important
role in the modulation of different genes coding for
proteins involved in metabolic pathways. In particular,
the expression of the SLC16A3 and CD147 genes was
significantly down-regulated in AKT1 silenced MSTO211H cells and significantly up-regulated in REN cells
overexpressing AKT1 (Figure 1E, 1F). No significant
change in SLC16A1 expression was observed (Figure
1E, 1F). Moreover, consistent with morphological
changes, we observed the modulation of CDH1 and VIM
expression (Figure 1E, and Supplementary Figure S1).

Increased intracellular lactate induces ERβ
expression

analysis, we observed a transient induction of ERβ
expression between the third and fifth day of spheroid
growth, that was sustained until the ninth day only in
those treated with KB9520 (Figure 4C). Furthermore,
treatment of spheroids with KB9520 for nine days resulted
in a significant growth inhibition and lactate accumulation
(Figure 4D). By RT-PCR, we documented that at the end
of the KB9520 treatment the expression of the EPAS1,
SLC16A3, CD147 genes were down-regulated, whereas
SLC16A1 expression remained unaffected (Figure 4E).

To examine if the observed increase in intracellular
lactate could be involved in the induction of ERβ
expression, we silenced the SLC16A3 gene, coding for
the lactate exporter MCT4, in the ERβ-null MSTO-211H
cells cultivated at normoxic conditions. As expected,
the functional consequence of SLC16A3 silencing was
an increase (more than five times) in the content of
intracellular lactate (Figure 2A, 2B). As shown in Figure
2C and 2D, this resulted, in turn, in the induction of
ERβ expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. In
addition, silencing of SLC16A3 in normoxic MSTO-211H
cells induced similar epithelioid-like phenotype as AKT1
silencing (see Figure 2A and 1A). To further explore
the role of lactate in the stimulation of ERβ expression,
MSTO-211H cells were treated with 30 mM lactate,
which in parallel to an increase in intracellular lactate also
lead to the induction of ERβ expression (Figure 2E, 2F).
Moreover, MSTO-211H cells cultured under hypoxic
conditions for 48 hours showed increased intracellular
levels of lactate, which was associated with an epithelioid
phenotype (Figure 3A) and increased expression of the
HIF-2 (EPAS1), E-Cadherin (CDH1) (Figure 3B) and ERβ
(ESR2) coding genes (Figure 3C, 3D). Further support for
the role of lactate in the modulation of ERβ expression,
the SLC16A1 gene, coding for the lactate importer MCT1,
was silenced in MSTO-211H cells cultured at hypoxic
conditions. SLC16A1 silencing resulted in changed cellular
phenotype from epithelioid to spindle-like (Figure 3E, 3F),
decreased intracellular lactate content (Figure 3E), and
decreased ERβ expression (Figure 3G, 3H).

The ERβ selective agonist KB9520 promotes
ERβ expression and reduces MSTO-211H
tumor growth in vivo
Based on the in vitro results, we decided to test if
ERβ expression was induced and if the selective ERβ
agonist could affect MSTO-211H tumor growth in an
in vivo mouse model. Six weeks old CD1 nude male mice
were inoculated intra peritoneum with 1 × 106 MSTO-211H
cells (2 groups, 8 animals per group). Prior to inoculation,
the MSTO-211H cells were transduced with a lentivirus
vector carrying the luciferase gene, to allow imaging
in live mice. Treatment of the animals was initiated 15
days after cell inoculation when tumor take-rate in the
peritoneal cavity was 100% in the two animal groups.
The ERβ-selective agonist KB9520 was administered on
day 15 through 40 by subcutaneous injection at 10 mg/
kg/day. Untreated animals were subcutaneously dosed
with empty vehicle. Tumor size was assessed by IVIS
imaging performed every 4–5 days. Starting from 10 days
of treatment, we observed a reduction in tumor growth in
the group treated with KB9520 as compared to the vehicle
treated animals, an effect that was maintained until the end
of the experiment (Figure 5A). Treatment with KB9520
was not toxic as assessed by monitoring changes of mice
body weights during drug administration (data not shown).
40 days after MPM cell inoculation, all animals were
sacrificed and tumors were dissected and immediately
frozen. By RT-PCR of tumor samples, we documented
that KB9520 treatment decreased the expression of the
SLC16A3 and CD147 genes and increased the expression
of the CDH1 gene. The expression of the SLC16A1 gene
remained, as in earlier experiments, unaffected (Figure
5B). By RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, we also
observed that tumor samples from mice treated with
KB9520 had increased ERβ expression both at mRNA
and protein levels compared to vehicle treated animals
(Figure 5C, 5D). Moreover, the level of phosphorylated
AKT was significantly lower in tumor cells from KB9520
treated mice compared to vehicle animals (Figure 5E).
In contrast, there was an increase in AKT1 acetylation
(Figure 5F). As recently described, acetylated AKT, due
to SIRT1 inactivation, prevents its correct localization and
phosphorylation [35]. We therefore decided to analyze the
expression of SIRT1 in MSTO-211H tumors recovered

MSTO-211H cells cultured at hypoxic conditions
or as spheroids acquire sensitivity to the ERβ
selective agonist KB9520
MSTO-211H cells cultured at normoxia do not
express ERβ and subsequently, and as previously reported,
do not respond to KB9520 [34]. However, since MSTO211H cells do express ERβ when cultured in hypoxic
conditions, we tested their response to the selective ERβ
agonist KB9520. As expected and in agreement with
previously published data [32], KB9520 significantly
reduced the cell growth of MSTO-211H cells cultivated
in hypoxic conditions (Figure 4A, 4B). Similar sensitivity
and growth inhibitory effect of KB9520 was also observed
in MSTO-211H cells, silenced for SLC16A3 gene
expression in normoxia (data not shown). ERβ expression
and response to the selective agonist KB9520 was also
evaluated in packed MSTO-211H spheroids. Multicellular
spheroids, differently from monolayer cultures, represent a
useful in vitro model that mimics spatial oxygen, glucose,
and lactate gradients present in in vivo under-vascularized
tumors. Interestingly, by RT-PCR and Western blot

from mice; SIRT1 expression was reduced in tumors from
KB9520 treated mice (Figure 5B). Similar AKT1 posttranslational modifications and SIRT1 down-regulation
were also observed in KB9520 treated MSTO-211H
cells cultivated in hypoxic conditions (Supplementary
Figure S2).

AKT is one of the most frequently hyperactivated kinase in
human MPM, isoform specificity remains to be explored.
We recently published that MPM derived cell lines express
AKT1 and AKT3 but not AKT2 [17]. In the present study,
we explored the effects of AKT1 modulation in MPM
derived cell lines representative of the epithelioid and
the biphasic histotype, characterized by different levels
of basal AKT1 expression. AKT1 modulation in vitro led
to marked changes in the cell morphology and, consistent
with this, in CDH1 expression, suggesting a role for the
AKT1 isoform in epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and in the reciprocal mesenchymal-epithelial
transition (MET). Interestingly, the observed changes
in cell morphology in response to AKT1 modulation
resembled those previously reported following ERβ
expression modulation in the same cell types [33]. Results
presented in this report suggest that AKT1 is involved in
the modulation of ERβ expression. In our previous studies,
we documented the role of ERβ as tumor suppressor and
positive prognostic factor in patients diagnosed with

DISCUSSION
The serine-threonine kinases family AKT (also
known as PKB) consists of three highly homologous
isoforms: AKT1 (PKBα), AKT2 (PKBβ) and AKT3
(PKBγ), encoded by different genes [36]. Findings from
AKT isoform-specific knockout mice suggest that the
functions of the different AKT kinases are not completely
overlapping and that isoform-specific signaling contributes
to the diversity of AKT activities [37]. There is evidence
for hyperactivation of specific AKT isoforms in certain
tumors, suggesting that in some cases there is an AKT
isoform-specificity to cell transformation [38]. Although

development patterns of in vivo avascular tumor nodules
in terms of morphology and growth kinetic properties [44].
When we cultured the ERβ negative MSTO-211H cells as
spheroids in vitro, ERβ was rapidly induced and then lost.
We believe that this transient expression of ERβ is best
explained by the uptake and rapid conversion of lactate
to pyruvate, by the peripheral normoxic cells in metabolic
symbiosis with hypoxic cells of the spheroid core, thereby
preventing intracellular accumulation of lactate. In
contrast, when ERβ was activated by its selective agonist
KB9520, its expression was maintained and cell growth
significantly inhibited. In spheroids treated with KB9520,
SLC16A3 and CD147 expression were down-regulated,
causing an increase in intracellular lactate that could in
part explain the maintenance of ERβ expression.
We also explored ERβ expression and response
to KB9520 in an in vivo MSTO-211H mouse model.
After an initial phase of latency in which tumors
transiently expressed ERβ, probably due to changes
of environmental conditions, we observed reduced
tumor growth in mice treated with KB9520. Similar
to observations in spheroids, ERβ expression was
maintained and SLC16A3 and CD147 gene expression
were down-modulated in tumor samples recovered
from KB9520 treated mice. Moreover, both in vitro and
in vivo we observed that activated ERβ significantly
inhibited AKT phosphorylation/activation, which
could represent another mechanism that explains its
sustained expression and tumor suppressive activity. A
possible explanation for the reduced phosphorylation
of AKT is the observed increase in its acetylation. It
has been reported that acetylation blocks binding of
AKT and PDK1 to PIP(3) [35], thereby preventing its
membrane localization and phosphorylation whereas
deacetylation by SIRT1 promotes AKT activation.
Mice injected with cells expressing a mutated AKT
that mimicked a constitutively acetylated form of
AKT, developed smaller tumors than those injected
with cells expressing wild-type AKT [35]. Consistent
with decreased expression of SIRT1 in vitro and
in vivo we observed increased AKT1 acetylation. The
reduced activation of AKT, along with the reduction
in expression of SLC16A3 and CD147, could be the
explanation for the reduced tumor growth. Collectively,
the presented data suggest that metabolic changes can
promote, via epigenetic modulations, ERβ expression
in ER negative cells and that its expression and tumor
suppressive function are maintained by its selective
ligand activation (Figure 6). The prognosis for patients
diagnosed with biphasic mesothelioma is less favorable
than those diagnosed with epithelioid mesothelioma
and depends on the ratio of sarcomatoid and epithelioid
cells in the biphasic tissue. The possibility to reverse the
more aggressive biphasic cell phenotype by targeting
ERβ with a selective agonist could represent a new
strategy to effectively treat this histological subtype of
mesothelioma.

MPM and described that one of the mechanisms by
which activated ERβ exerts tumor suppressive function
is the alteration of aerobic energy metabolism, impairing
mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and forcing
cells to depend on glycolysis [34]. The regulation of
metabolism in cancer by the AKT kinases is a very active
area of research, but there is a limited understanding about
the role of the AKT family members. Here we describe
that, in MPM cells, AKT1 modulates the expression of
SLC16A3 and CD147, coding for the two proteins MCT4
and Basigin, which are involved in metabolic pathways.
MCTs are proteins that facilitate the transmembrane
transport of short-chain fatty acids, such as lactate,
coupled with a proton. The release of lactate occurs mainly
through MCT4, whereas its uptake occurs through MCT1
[39]. Of note, the MCTs (primarily the MCT1 and MCT4)
and Basigin are overexpressed in most tumors, including
MPM [40]. Basigin has been described to associate with
the MCT transporter isoforms MCT1 and MCT4, acting as
a chaperone and facilitating their cell surface expression
and/or appropriate insertion and location. Targeting MCTs/
Basigin complexes was reported to impair the in vitro and
in vivo growth of pancreatic tumor cells, Ras-transformed
fibroblasts, colon adenocarcinoma, and Myc-induced
human malignancies, suggesting that blocking lactic acid
export provides an efficient metabolic therapy to limit
tumor cell growth [41]. Lactate was originally thought to
be an acidic molecule, which must be exported to prevent
deleterious intracellular acidification. Recently, different
roles of lactate export/import have been implicated in
tumor growth [42]. For example, it has been described that
lactate exerts a transcriptional effect acting like a histone
deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, linking the metabolic state
of the cell to gene transcription. Lactate is a relatively
weak inhibitor, compared to the established HDAC
inhibitors, but the repertoire of genes regulated overlap
[43]. Here we provide data that the increase in intracellular
lactate content induced ERβ expression in MSTO-211H
cells, as evidenced by addition of lactate to the growth
medium, or its increase due to knock-down of MCT4
expression or by culturing cells in hypoxic condition.
Based on the results following treatment of MSTO211H cells with the established HDAC inhibitor SAHA
(Supplementary Figure S3) we find the role of lactate
as HDAC inhibitor to be the most plausible mechanistic
explanation behind the increased expression of ERβ in the
MSTO-211H cells.
We used the 3-dimensional tumor cell model of
spheroids to further explore the role of lactate and/or
hypoxia in ERβ modulation. Since the cells in spheroids
are not grown in a monolayer, they are exposed to varying
degrees of oxygenation and nutrient availability based on
their spatial distribution. Moreover, the spheroid system
circumvents a major problem of tumor analysis in vivo,
which is the difficulty of distinguishing between local
environmental effects and differences due to cellular
heterogeneity; multicellular tumor spheroids mimic the

10 μg/ml penicillin at 37°C in a humidified environment
containing 5% CO2. Cell cultures under hypoxic conditions
were performed in 1% O2 gas mixture using a modulator
incubator chamber. Mycoplasma infection was excluded
by the use of Mycoplasma PlusTM PCR Primer Set kit

RNA, DNA isolation and quantitative
real-time PCR

from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA). Cells grown to
80% confluence in tissue culture dishes were transiently
transfected with the pcDNA3 AKT1-HA plasmid (Addgene,
Cambridge, MA, USA) using LipofectAMINE reagent as
described by the manufacturer. Gene silencing was achieved
by specific siRNAs from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany).

Total RNA was extracted using the guanidinium
thyocianate method. Starting from equal amounts of
RNA, cDNA used as template for amplification in the
real-time PCR (5 μg), was synthesized by the reverse
transcription reaction using RevertAid Minus First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit from Fermentas-Thermo Scientific
(Burlington, ON, Canada), using random hexamers as
primers, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
primers sequences are reported in Supplementary Figure S4.
The real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was
performed using the double- stranded DNA-binding
dye SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Fermentas-Thermo
Scientific) on an ABI GeneAmp 7000 Sequence Detection
System machine, as described by the manufacturer. The
instrument, for each gene tested, obtained graphical Cycle
threshold (Ct) values automatically. Triplicate reactions
were performed for each marker and the melting curves
were constructed using Dissociation Curves Software
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), to ensure that
only a single product was amplified.

Proliferation assays
Cells were seeded at a density of 10 × 104 cells/well
in 6-well plates in RPMI medium supplemented with 10%
FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 10 μg/ml penicillin and
incubated over-night at 37°C in a humidified environment
containing 5% CO2 to allow adherence. Following
treatment cells were trypsinized and stained with Trypan
blue. The number of cells considered viable (unstained
cells) was counted in a Bürker haemocytometer within 5
minutes after staining.

Detection of intracellular lactate content
The intracellular lactate amount was analyzed
using the Lactate Assay Kit from Sigma Aldrich (St
Louis, MO, USA). Cells were trypsinized, washed with
PBS and homogenized in 4 volumes of the Lactate Assay
Buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 13.000 g for 10
minutes to remove insoluble material, and then stored at
–80°C to inhibit lactate dehydrogenases activity. Lactate
concentration was determined by an enzymatic assay,
which results in a colorimetric (absorbance at 570 nm)
product, proportional to the lactate present. For each
assay performed, a standard curve was generated using
lactate standards provided in the kit. Lactate concentration
of samples was determined by plotting samples on the
standard curve. Intracellular lactate was normalized to
protein concentration of the sample.

Multicellular spheroids
Multicellular spheroids were generated in nonadsorbent round-bottomed 96-well plates, as described
[47]. The 96-well plates were coated with a 1:24 dilution
of polyHEMA (120 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) in 95% ethanol and dried at 37°C for 24 h. Before
use, plates were sterilized by UV light for 30 min. For
generation of multicellular spheroids, 103 cells were
added into each well of polyHEMA-coated 96-well plate
in medium added with 2.5% Matrigel and placed in a 37°C
humidified incubator with 5% CO2. After an initiation
interval of 24 hours, 50% of supernatant was replaced with
fresh medium ± KB9520 (at final concentration of 10 nM)
every 24 hours.

Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot
Cells were extracted with 1% NP-40 lysis buffer
(1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5
mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 0.4 mM
Na3VO4) with freshly added protease inhibitors (10 μg/
ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin and 0.1 Unit/ml aprotinin).
Lysates were centrifuged at 13.000 × g for 10 minutes
at 4°C and the supernatants were collected and assayed
for protein concentration with the Bio-Rad protein assay
method. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 2 mg of
extracted protein for each treatment were incubated with
specific antibodies for 1 hour at 4°C and 50 μl protein
A-Sepharose beads. Proteins were separated by SDSPAGE under reducing conditions. Following SDS-PAGE,
proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, reacted with
specific antibodies and then detected with peroxidaseconjugate secondary antibodies and chemioluminescent
ECL reagent. Densitometric analysis was performed using
the GS 250 Molecular Image (Bio-Rad).

In vivo experiments
Animals
CD1 nude mice (males, 6 weeks old; Charles River,
Calco, Italy) received intra- peritoneal (i.p.) injections of
1 × 106 luciferase transduced MSTO-211H cells in 0.5 mL
of RPMI medium. After anesthetization and i.p. injections
of 0.3 mL of 15 mg/mL D-luciferin, tumor dimension and
localization of luminescent cells was monitored using the In
Vivo Imaging System (IVIS®) system 100 series (Xenogen
Corporation, Hopkinton, MA, USA). Regions of interest
were identified around the tumor sites and were quantified
as total photon counts using Living Image software
(Xenogen Corporation). To evaluate treatment toxicity,
mice were weighed at the start and end of treatments. Mice
were killed and necropsied after 25 days of treatment.
In vivo experiments were approved by Istituto Scientifico
25131

An elapse of 15 days was allowed for the
formation of detectable tumor nodules, assessed by
IVIS® imaging. Mice were then weighed and stratified
into treatment groups of ten animals. Treatment
protocols were done from the 15th day to the 40th
day, and mice were analyzed every 4–5 days by IVIS®
imaging to assess tumor growth. One dose of KB9520
was used (10 mg/kg/day). KB9520 was dissolved in
the vehicle (5% DMSO/40% PEG 400/55% water) and
administrated once daily (days 15–40) by sub-cutaneous
administration. Untreated animals were dosed with
empty vehicle. At day 40 mice from the two groups
were euthanized and necropsied. Tumors growing in
the peritoneum were excised, and one part of the tumor
tissues was immediately frozen and stored at –80°C for
subsequent analysis.
