Abstract
Coordination of the multiple processes underlying DNA
replication is key for maintaining genome stability and preventing tumorigenesis. CLASPIN, a critical player in replication
fork stabilization and checkpoint responses, must be tightly
regulated during the cell cycle to prevent the accumulation of
DNA damage. In this study, we used a quantitative proteomics
approach and identiﬁed USP9X as a novel CLASPIN-interacting
protein. USP9X is a deubiquitinase involved in multiple signaling and survival pathways whose tumor suppressor or
oncogenic activity is highly context dependent. We found that
USP9X regulated the expression and stability of CLASPIN in an
S-phase–speciﬁc manner. USP9X depletion profoundly impairs

the progression of DNA replication forks, causing unscheduled
termination events with a frequency similar to CLASPIN depletion, resulting in excessive endogenous DNA damage. Importantly, restoration of CLASPIN expression in USP9X-depleted
cells partially suppressed the accumulation of DNA damage.
Furthermore, USP9X depletion compromised CHK1 activation
in response to hydroxyurea and UV, thus promoting hypersensitivity to drug-induced replication stress. Taken together, our
results reveal a novel role for USP9X in the maintenance of
genomic stability during DNA replication and provide potential mechanistic insights into its tumor suppressor role in
certain malignancies. Cancer Res; 76(8); 2384–93. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

CLASPIN, critical for both DNA synthesis and for signaling the
presence of replication stress, is a ring-shaped protein that,
together with the TIPIN–TIM1 complex, physically links DNA
polymerases and DNA helicase (4–6); this is important for
stabilization of replication forks, both during normal replication
and upon prolonged arrest (1, 2, 7). CLASPIN also plays an
important role in the replication stress response pathway (3, 8,
9), as ATR activation of CHK1 is favored by the binding of CHK1
to CLASPIN (2, 10–13).
Several kinases have been reported to phosphorylate CLASPIN
and promote CHK1 activation, including CHK1 itself (4–6, 14),
casein kinase 1 gamma 1 (CK1g1; ref. 15), and CDC7 (16, 17).
Phosphorylation of CLASPIN at its N-terminus by PLK1 can also
contribute to switching off CHK1 once the damage is repaired,
thus allowing cells to progress in the cell cycle (18, 19). Mechanistically, PLK1 phosphorylation of CLASPIN creates a phosphodegron domain recognized by the SCF-bTrCP ubiquitin ligase,
leading to proteasome degradation (18, 19).
Ubiquitinylation regulates CLASPIN levels not only during
checkpoint recovery but also during other phases of the cell cycle.
For example in G1, CLASPIN degradation is promoted by the
APC/C Cdh1-mediated K48-linked polyubiquitinylation (20).
Several deubiquitinylating enzymes (DUB) have been shown to
counteract proteosomal degradation of CLASPIN: USP28 was
reported to reverse the APC/C Cdh1-dependent degradation
(20, 21), whereas USP7 and more recently USP29 have been
shown to stabilize CLASPIN degradation mediated by SCF-bTrCP
(22, 23). Two concurrent reports have recently identiﬁed USP20
as a fourth DUB, which regulates CLASPIN stability with a
particular relevance during replication stress (24, 25). USP20

The timely and precise duplication of DNA in S-phase of the
cell cycle is critical to maintaining genome stability and preventing tumorigenesis (1, 2). Indeed, genome duplication is a
tightly coordinated process where mechanisms that regulate
replication origin activation lead to the assembly of new
replication forks in a deﬁned spatiotemporal program (3).
During S-phase, cells are extremely vulnerable to exogenous
and endogenous sources of DNA damage that impede the
progression of replication forks thus causing replication stress.
Importantly, cellular surveillance mechanisms that overlap
with the DNA damage response pathways detect, stabilize,
and resolve stalled replication forks to help preserve genome
stability (2).

USP9X Role in Genome Stability

itself is regulated by ATR-dependent phosphorylation, resulting in
its disassociation from the E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2 and in its
stabilization (24, 25).
The regulation of the DNA damage response by ubiquitinylation and deubiquitinylation is well established, with many DUBs
involved in genome stability (26) often regulating multiple
proteins involved in the same pathway. For example, USP7 not
only regulates CLASPIN levels, but also directly deubiquitinylates
CHK1 and RNF168 (27, 28), whereas USP28 controls the levels of
53BP1 and CHK2 (20).
We have identiﬁed USP9X as a novel DUB that binds CLASPIN
and regulates its levels. USP9X is one of the largest ubiquitinspeciﬁc proteases (USP) and it has been implicated in a number of
essential cellular processes, and knockout of this gene is embryonic lethal in mice (29). USP9X is involved in the regulation of cell
adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin, chromosome segregation, NOTCH, and TGFb signaling as well as apoptosis (comprehensively reviewed in ref. 30).
In different cancers, USP9X can act as an oncogene or as a tumor
suppressor gene in a context-dependent manner: USP9X is overexpressed in multiple carcinomas including lymphomas, non–
small cell lung and breast cancer (30). The best described oncogenic
function of USP9X derives from its role in promoting the deubiquitinylation and stabilization of antiapoptotic protein MCL1.
Furthermore, elevated expression of MCL1 is found in numerous
cancers and is associated with resistance to chemotherapy (31).
On the contrary, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, USP9X
acts as tumor suppressor with low expression associated with poor
patient outcome and widespread metastasis (32). However, little
is known at the molecular level about USP9X tumor suppression
function. The ubiquitin ligase ITCH is a USP9X substrate and may
be involved in this role, as ITCH was partially responsible for the
ability of USP9X to promote anoikis and suppress colony formation (32). Also in ERa-positive breast cancers, USP9X downregulation can promote resistance to tamoxifen, as ERa is stabilized on chromatin, driving the activation of ERa-responsive
genes (33).
In this work, we uncover a novel role of USP9X in the maintenance of genome stability. We show that USP9X interacts with
CLASPIN and that its downregulation destabilizes CLASPIN in an
S-phase–speciﬁc manner. We also demonstrate that USP9X depletion impacts CLASPIN function in both replication fork dynamics
and the DNA damage response, resulting in the accumulation of
DNA damage.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
U2OS osteosarcoma cells were obtained from Noel Lowndes
laboratory (National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland) in 2011 and were ﬁrst authenticated by short tandem repeat
analysis and subsequently certiﬁed in 2015 by transposon proﬁling. Flp-In T-REx 293 cells (purchased from Life Technologies
and validated by ATCC in 2011) conditionally expressing CLASPIN tagged with a dual C-terminal Flag/OneSTrEP tag were
generated in this study (Supplementary Materials and Methods).
Cells were cultured at 37 C, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented
with 1% penicillin–streptomycin and heat-inactivated 10% FBS
(Sigma-Aldrich).
Plasmids expressing full-length USP9X or a catalytically inactive mutant (C1566A) were described previously (34) and

www.aacrjournals.org

obtained from MRC PPU Reagents - University of Dundee
(https://mrcppureagents.dundee.ac.uk). Transfections were performed using jetPRIME (Polyplus) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Drug treatments and UV irradiation
Doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 1 mg/mL to induce the
expression of CLASPIN, hydroxyurea (HU; Sigma-Aldrich) was
used at 2 mmol/L, MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 10 mmol/L, nocodazole (Noc; Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 mmol/L, cyclohexamide (Chx;
Sigma-Aldrich) at 10 1 mmol/L, and WP1130 (SelleckChem) at
5 mmol/L. For experiments using UV, cells were irradiated with
20 J/m2 using a UV lamp (UVItec).
siRNA
siRNAs were previously described and purchased from SigmaAldrich: siUSP9X(i) - AGAAAUCGCUGGUAUAAAUUU (35),
siUSP9X(ii) - GCAGUGAGUGGCUGGAAGUTT (36), siClaspin
- GCACAUACAUGAUAAAGAA (37), siHERC2 - GCGGAAGCCUCAUUAGAAA (25), siUSP20 - CCAUAGGAGAGGUGACCAA
(25), siUSP7 - ACCCUUGGACAAUAUUCCU (38). As control,
the Ambion negative control #1 (Ambion) was used. Cells were
transfected with 100 nmol/L of all siRNAs for 48 hours using
jetPRIME (Polyplus).
Protein manipulation
Whole-cell extracts were prepared in buffer A (50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1%
Triton-X) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors
(Sigma-Aldrich) For immunoblotting, proteins were resolved
by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
prior to overnight incubation with primary antibodies and
infrared-labeled secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands
were visualized and quantiﬁed using Odyssey Infrared Imaging
Systems (Li-COR Biosciences).
For immunoprecipitation experiments, precleared protein
extracts were incubated with antibodies that were prebound to
protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For Strep-afﬁnity
puriﬁcations, precleared extracts were incubated with Strep-Tactin
Sepharose resin (IBA). Following extensive washes in buffer A,
bound proteins were recovered by eluting in buffer A containing
10 mmol/L biotin (Sigma-Aldrich) or by boiling the beads in
Laemmli buffer.
SILAC and mass spectrometry
Empty vector and Strep-CLASPIN expressing cells were grown
for 5 passages in medium (R6K4) or light (R0K0) SILAC medium
(Dundee Cell Products, catalog no. LM016 and LM014), respectively. Protein extracts were prepared as above and loaded onto
individually preequilibrated Strep-Tactin Sepharose columns
(IBA). Proteins were recovered by biotin competition, mixed at
1:1 ratio, concentrated on an Amicon centrifugal ﬁlter (10 kDa
cutoff), and resolved on a 4% to 12% precast gel (Bio-Rad). Gels
were stained by Coomassie Colloidal Blue (Sigma-Aldrich) and
lanes were cut into 10 slices, each of which was subject to
reduction, alkylation, and trypsin digestion as described previously (39). Peptides were separated and analyzed on an UHPLC
(Easy-nLC 1000, Proxeon) connected to a QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Detailed protocol is available
in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Flow cytometry
For the analysis of DNA damage, cells were ﬁxed with 1%
formaldehyde/PBS and permeabilized with PBS containing
0.05% saponin and 1% BSA. Cells were then stained with primary
rabbit anti-pSer139 Histone H2A.X antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology, catalog no. 9718s) and mouse anti-Strep antibody
(Qiagen, catalog no. 34850) followed by incubation with secondary Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen)
and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen),
respectively. DNA was stained with 1 mg/mL DAPI (SigmaAldrich). Data were acquired on a BD FACSCanto II cytometer
(BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software v10. Statistical analysis of three independent experiments was performed
using Prism (GraphPad Software).
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
Cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with PBS-TX (PBS 0.1% Triton X-100). Primary rabbit antipSer139 Histone H2A.X antibody (Cell Signaling Technology,
catalog no. 9718s) was used together with mouse anti-Strep
antibody (Qiagen, catalog no. 34850). Secondary antibodies were
Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit antibody and Alexa Fluor 488
goat anti-mouse antibody (Invitrogen). Cells were examined
using an IX71 Olympus microscope with a 40 oil immersion
objective.

Results
CLASPIN-interacting proteins
To obtain further insights into CLASPIN function and regulation, we aimed to identify CLASPIN-interacting proteins. To this
end, we generated a Flp-In T-Rex HEK-293 cell line in which a
tagged-CLASPIN (Strep-CLASPIN) fusion protein is conditionally
expressed from a TET-controlled promoter upon the addition of
doxycycline to the culture medium. The levels of CLASPIN in these

cells increased by approximately 5-fold following induction with
doxycycline and the fusion protein was easily detected with either
anti-Strep or anti-CLASPIN antibodies (Fig. 1A). Strep-CLASPIN
did not affect cell proliferation for at least 3 days, nor did it affect
the distribution of cells within the different phases of the cell cycle.
Furthermore, Strep-CLASPIN protein levels ﬂuctuated during the
cell cycle with maximum expression during the S-phase (Supplementary Fig. S1).
By exploiting the Strep–tag at the C-terminus of the protein,
we devised an afﬁnity puriﬁcation protocol to enrich for StrepCLASPIN and potential interacting proteins. After 24 hours of
induction with doxycycline, empty vector or Strep-CLASPIN
cells were lysed in a 300 mmol/L NaCl containing buffer, as
this is sufﬁcient to extract most of the protein from chromatin
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Protein extracts were loaded onto
Strep-Tactin columns and, after extensive washing, bound
proteins were eluted by addition of biotin. By immunoblotting, we conﬁrmed that Strep-CLASPIN protein was highly
enriched in the partially puriﬁed fractions, and that a known
CLASPIN-interacting protein, CDC45, was also speciﬁcally
found only in the fractions obtained from the Strep-CLASPIN
cells (Fig. 1B).
Notably, by staining these fractions with silver, we observed
that many more proteins were present in the eluate derived from
Strep-CLASPIN cells compared with the control, suggesting
that several different proteins could potentially bind to CLASPIN
(Fig. 1C). To determine the identity of these proteins, we used a
SILAC proteomic approach, where empty vector and Strep-CLASPIN cells were grown on media containing unlabeled or labeled
amino acids. Protein extracts were prepared as above and loaded
onto individually preequilibrated Strep-Tactin columns prior to
washing and biotin-mediated elution. Eluates from empty vector
and Strep-CLASPIN afﬁnity puriﬁcations were mixed 1:1,
concentrated, and proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE prior

vector or Strep-CLASPIN cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Strep and anti-CDC45 antibodies, GAPDH was used as loading control and as a control
for the puriﬁcation procedure. C, partially puriﬁed fractions shown in B were separated on a 10% SDS–PAGE gel and the gel was stained with silver.

USP9X Role in Genome Stability

to in-gel digestion and quantitative mass spectrometry analysis.
We were able to identify and quantify 334 proteins, excluding
potential contaminants and reverse hits; these show a distribution
markedly skewed toward the bait, indicating that the negative
control is relatively clean and that most of the proteins are
potential CLASPIN interactors. Indeed, together with the bait
Strep-CLASPIN, we found that several known CLASPIN interactors were detected, including MCM2-3-6 subunits of the MCM
complex. Notably, among the enriched proteins, we observed a
large number of proteasome subunits and enzymes involved in
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, including the deubiquitinase
USP9X (Supplementary Table S1).
USP9X interacts with CLASPIN
The identiﬁcation of USP9X was particularly intriguing as
several deubiquitinases have recently been shown to be involved
in regulating CLASPIN including USP28, USP7, USP20, and
USP29 (20, 22–25).
To assess whether USP9X interacts with CLASPIN, we ﬁrst
repeated the afﬁnity puriﬁcation of Strep-CLASPIN protein on
a smaller scale, and analyzed the eluted proteins by immunoblotting. Indeed, USP9X was speciﬁcally detected in the fractions
derived from Strep-CLASPIN–expressing cells and not in the
control (Fig. 2A). By performing reciprocal immunoprecipitation
experiments using USP9X antibodies or IgG control and extracts
from Strep-CLASPIN–expressing cells, we detected an anti-Strep
immunoreactive band in the USP9X immunoprecipitated material (Fig. 2B). More importantly, by immunoprecipitating USP9X
from extracts prepared from U2OS cells, we recovered endogenous CLASPIN (Fig. 2C). Altogether, these data indicate that
USP9X, either directly or indirectly, associates with both endogenous and ectopically expressed CLASPIN.
USP9X stabilizes CLASPIN in S-phase
To begin exploring the relationship between USP9X and
CLASPIN, we performed siRNA-mediated depletion of USP9X in
HEK-293 cells using two different siRNAs targeting USP9X mRNA,
that have been extensively validated in several studies (35, 36).
We observed that both USP9X siRNAs efﬁciently reduce USP9X
protein levels when measured 48 hours posttransfection (Fig. 3A).
Interestingly, depletion of USP9X also correlated with an obvious

decrease of CLASPIN, although the depletion was not as pronounced as by a speciﬁc siRNA that directly targets CLASPIN
mRNA (Fig. 3A). The effect of USP9X depletion on CLASPIN levels
was not only found in HEK-293 cells but also observed in U2OS
cells (Fig. 3B). Growth and distribution of cells within the cell
cycle was not grossly affected by USP9X depletion in either cell
line (Supplementary Fig. S3).
These observations suggested the possibility that USP9X, being
an ubiquitin-speciﬁc peptidase, may regulate CLASPIN levels by
affecting its turnover, possibly through the proteasome. If this is
the case, then proteasome inhibition would be expected to
rescue CLASPIN levels and indeed upon treatment with MG132,
CLASPIN levels were stable in the presence of USP9X depletion, in
a manner similar to p21, a CDK inhibitor and well-known
substrate of the proteasome (Fig. 3C; ref. 40). The level of USP9X
itself was increased by MG132 treatment in cells transfected with
control siRNA but not in cells transfected with USP9X-targeting
siRNA. Thus, the decrease of CLASPIN observed upon USP9X
depletion is most likely caused by accelerated proteasomemediated degradation. To test this hypothesis, U2OS cells were
transfected with either control or USP9X-targeting siRNA.
Cycloheximide was added to prevent further protein synthesis,
samples were harvested at different time points, and protein
levels analyzed by semiquantitative immunoblotting. Although
in USP9X-depleted cells, CLASPIN levels were already reduced
at the beginning of the experiments, its level rapidly decreased
to become almost undetectable after 6 hours, whereas in
control cells, CLASPIN levels decline with a slower kinetics
(Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S4).
As multiple mechanisms have been shown to control
CLASPIN degradation in different phases of the cell cycle and
to obtain better insights into the role of USP9X in CLASPIN
stability, we used the Strep-CLASPIN cells. These were grown in
doxycycline-containing medium, arrested in either S-phase
with HU or in mitosis with nocodazole, and the rate of
degradation of Strep-CLASPIN protein analyzed as above. First,
we observed that the Strep-CLASPIN protein, similarly to
endogenous CLASPIN is stabilized in S-phase compared with
mitosis (Fig. 3E) and second, we found that the treatment with
the small-molecule WP1130, a deubiquitinase inhibitor that
shows some speciﬁcity for USP9X (41), destabilizes the protein

Figure 2.
USP9X interacts with CLASPIN. A, proteins were pulled down using Strep-Tactin resin from extracts prepared from empty vector (EV) cells or cells expressing
Strep-CLASPIN. Whole cell extracts (WCE) and pulled down material (PD) were probed with either anti-Strep or with anti-USP9X antibodies. B, immunoprecipitated
proteins with anti-USP9X antibodies or control IgG from extracts prepared from cells expressing Strep-CLASPIN were analyzed by immunoblotting.
Tagged CLASPIN interacting with USP9X was detected with an anti-Strep antibody. C, as in B, but extracts were prepared from U2OS cells and endogenous CLASPIN
interacting with USP9X was detected using an anti-CLASPIN antibody.

USP9X controls CLASPIN levels. A, HEK-293 were transfected with either a siRNA targeting CLASPIN, two different siRNAs targeting USP9X, or a control siRNA. After
48 hours, cells were harvested and proteins analyzed by immunoblotting. B, HEK-293 and U2OS were transfected with either USP9X or control siRNAs. Proteins
were then analyzed after 48 hours as above. C, U2OS cells were transfected with either USP9X or control siRNA; 45 hours posttransfection, MG132 was added as
indicated; cells were then collected 3 hours later and protein analyzed. D, U2OS cells were transfected with either control or USP9X siRNA. After 48 hours,
cycloheximide (Chx) was added and cells harvested at the indicated time points. Protein samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. E, HEK-293 cells expressing
Strep-CLASPIN were ﬁrst arrested in S-phase with HU or in mitosis with nocodazole. Cycloheximide was then added to prevent further protein synthesis in the
presence or absence of the USP9X inhibitor WP1130 and samples were harvested at the indicated times. A sample from the same cell line uninduced (U) was loaded as
control. F, empty vector (EV)– or Strep-CLASPIN–expressing cells were transfected with a plasmid-expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin and arrested in S-phase with HU.
Pull downs were performed with Strep-Tactin resin and samples were analyzed with anti-Strep antibody and anti-HA antibody to detect ubiquitinylated
protein. G, U2OS were transfected with constructs expressing either functional (WT) or catalytically dead C1566A (CD) USP9X. After 24 hours, cells were either
collected (lanes 1–3) or treated with cycloheximide for a further 6 hours (lanes 4–6). Protein extracts were then prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting.

only in S-phase cells. We then looked at ubiquitinylation levels
of the Strep-CLASPIN protein in S-phase. For these experiments, Strep-CLASPIN–expressing cells were transfected with
a construct expressing HA-tagged ubiquitin, arrested in S-phase
by HU, and treated with WP1130 in the presence of MG132;
ubiquitinylation was then assessed by Strep-afﬁnity puriﬁcation and anti-HA immunoblotting. Figure 3F shows that in
untreated cells, the levels of CLASPIN ubiquitinylation are
hardly detectable over background (Fig. 3F, lane 1–2). As

2388 Cancer Res; 76(8) April 15, 2016

expected, MG132 caused an increase in ubiquitinylated
CLASPIN and addition of WP1130 further enhanced accumulation of ubiquitinylated forms (Fig. 3F, lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that USP9X could contribute to the removal of ubiquitin chains from CLASPIN. The role of USP9X in protecting
CLASPIN from proteasome-dependent degradation was then
further assessed by overexpressing either wild type or a catalytically dead version of USP9X carrying a single amino
acid change in its active site (C1566A; ref. 34) in U2OS cells.

USP9X Role in Genome Stability

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cycloheximide was added
for 6 hours to the culture and the residual levels of CLASPIN
assessed by Western blotting. Figure 3G and Supplementary
Fig. S5 show that overexpression of USP9X indeed prevents the
CLASPIN degradation, whereas the C1566A-mutant proteins
fails to stabilize CLASPIN, indicating that the catalytic activity
of USP9X is required.
USP9X depletion does not affect the levels of other DUBs
involved in preventing CLASPIN degradation and USP9X levels
are unaffected by their depletion
To gain insight into the mechanism by which USP9X protects CLASPIN, we ﬁrst explored the relationship between
USP9X and other DUBs that contribute to CLASPIN stabilization during S-phase, namely, USP29, USP7, and USP20. U2OS
cells were transfected with siRNA targeting these DUBs and
protein levels assessed by immunoblotting 48 hours later. As
USP20 itself is stabilized by the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase, a
HERC2-targeting siRNA was also used in these experiments.
First, we found that depletion of USP9X did not affect the
levels of any of these DUBs (Fig. 4). We then asked the
reciprocal question of whether depletion of USP7, USP20,
and USP29 regulates USP9X abundance. We observed that
neither USP7 nor USP20 depletion affected the levels of
USP9X (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 5). Similarly HERC2 depletion did
not change USP9X levels although, as reported previously
(25), promoted USP20 stabilization (Fig. 4). In these experiments, we also noticed that USP20 depletion correlated with

Figure 5.
USP9X depletion impairs DNA replication fork stability. A, U2OS cells were
transfected with either control (black bars), USP9X (gray bars), or CLASPIN
(white bars) targeting siRNA; after 48 hours, cells were labeled with
consecutive pulses of IdUrd and CldU. Replication intermediates were

a decrease in USP29, suggesting a functional cross-talk
between the two DUBs (Fig. 4). Our repeated attempts to
downregulate USP29 by siRNAs did not result in a convincing depletion of the protein, thus we could not assess
whether USP29 directly affects USP9X levels.

Altogether these data suggest that USP9X may act in an independent manner from the previously reported USPs that control
CLASPIN stability in S-phase.
USP9X depletion causes DNA replication fork instability and
defective replication checkpoint responses
The ﬁnding that USP9X controls CLASPIN levels in S-phase
prompted us to test the hypothesis that DNA replication
dynamics could be affected. In particular, we investigated
whether USP9X depletion would affect ongoing replication
forks and origin ﬁring using a DNA ﬁber labeling technique
(42–44). U2OS cells were transfected with control, USP9X, or
CLASPIN siRNAs, and after 48 hours nascent DNA was sequentially labeled for 30 minutes with the nucleotide analogue
iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) followed by washing for 30 minutes
with chloro-deoxyuridine (CldU). Cells were then lysed, DNA
ﬁbers prepared, and nascent DNA analyzed by ﬂuorescence
microscopy, with IdUrd-containing DNA visualized with
TRITC-conjugated antibodies (red) and CldU-containing DNA
with FITC-conjugated antibodies (green). Strikingly, we
observed that in the USP9X-depleted cells, the percentage of
termination events and stalled forks, scored as red only tracks,
was greatly increased compared with siRNA control–transfected
cells and was at a similar level to that seen by CLASPIN
depletion (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, and similar to what has
already been reported for CLASPIN depletion (7), the amount
of DNA synthesized during the second labeling period was
severely reduced as observed by short green tracks in the
USP9X-depleted cells. In our experiments, neither USP9X nor
CLASPIN depletion appeared to have a signiﬁcant impact on
the origin ﬁring (green only tracks).
Using a different labeling strategy, we asked whether USP9X
depletion could affect replication fork restart after forks have
been blocked by treating cells with ribonucleotide inhibitor
HU. In these experiments, cells were ﬁrst labeled for 30 minutes
with IdUrd, then IdUrd was removed and HU was added, and
after two further hours, the drug was washed away and CldU
was added to label replication products. Again, compared with
controls, in both USP9X- and CLASPIN-depleted cells, we
observed an increase in the number of red only tracks indicative
of replication forks that collapsed or were unable to restart after
HU removal (Fig. 5B).
The role of CLASPIN in mediating ATR-dependent phosphorylation of CHK1 in the response to DNA replication blockade
or DNA damage has been widely documented, thus we predicted that lower CLASPIN levels may also impact on ATR
signaling. To verify this hypothesis, U2OS cells transfected with
either control or USP9X-speciﬁc siRNAs were treated with HU,
samples were collected throughout a 2-hour time course experiment, and protein analyzed. Figure 6A and Supplementary Fig.
S6A show that CHK1 phosphorylation at Ser317 is severely
reduced in USP9X-depleted cells compared with the control.
Low CLASPIN levels and defective phosphorylation of CHK1
upon HU treatment were also observed in USP9X-depleted
hTERT-immortalized retinal pigment epithelial RPE1 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6B). To assess whether defective checkpoint signaling in USP9X-depleted cells was not limited to HU,
but a more general response to replication stress, U2OS cells
were irradiated with 20 J/m2 of UV light and samples collected
30 minutes and 2 hours after irradiation. Figure 6B shows that
again the levels of CHK1 phosphorylation at Ser317 were

USP9X Role in Genome Stability

Figure 7.
USP9X depletion results in the accumulation of DNA damage. A, empty vector or Strep-CLASPIN expressing HEK-293 cells were transfected with USP9X or control
siRNA. Cells were stained with anti-g-H2AX antibody detecting H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139 and anti-Strep-antibody detecting the expression of
Strep-CLASPIN protein in individual cells. B, analysis of g-H2AX by ﬂow cytometry. Bars indicate the average percentage of g-H2AX–positive cells in each

reduced. We then assessed the effects of prolonged replication
stress in USP9X-depleted cells using a colony-forming assay. In
these experiments after transfection with control and USP9X
siRNAs, U2OS cells were incubated for 18 hours with increasing
amounts of HU, plated and the number of colonies scored after
10 days. We noticed that in this cell line, USP9X depletion
caused a substantial decrease in plating efﬁciency without any
added replication stress; however, upon HU treatment, the
decrease in colony formation is further enhanced in USP9Xdepleted cells when compared with control cells at all doses
tested (Fig. 6B). The loss of clonogenic potential upon depletion of USP9X could indicate the inherent problems with
ongoing replication upon depletion of USP9X in a normal cell
cycle, but clearly the decrease in survival observed upon HU
treatment reveals that USP9X plays an important role in dealing
with replication stress.
CLASPIN-dependent DNA damage in USP9X-depleted cells
The observations that USP9X depletion affects replication
fork stability and that USP9X contributes to efﬁcient induction
of the DNA replication checkpoint, suggested that depletion of
USP9X would lead to accumulation of DNA damage. As
expected, a large number of nuclei of USP9X-depleted cells
stained positive for phosphorylated H2AX at serine 139
(g-H2AX). The g-H2AX staining pattern was very heterogeneous, with some cells showing only punctuate staining and
others with very bright pan nuclear staining, these features are
reminiscent of the phenotype we observe upon CLASPIN
depletion (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Fig. S6C; ref. 45). DNA
damage upon USP9X depletion was observed in a different cell
line and with two independent USP9X-targeting siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S6C).
Importantly, the addition of doxycycline, causing ectopic
expression of Strep-CLASPIN protein, signiﬁcantly reduced the
percentage of cells with damaged DNA (Fig. 7A and B).

www.aacrjournals.org

Altogether, these data show that reduced levels of CLASPIN, as a
result of USP9X depletion, are among the primary contributing
factors causing DNA damage.

Discussion
In this work, we provide evidence that USP9X is critical for
efﬁcient DNA replication. USP9X depletion causes spontaneous
replication fork stalling and increased sensitivity to HU. We also
show that USP9X controls CLASPIN levels, most likely through
counteracting its ubiquitinylation in S-phase. Strikingly, the effect
of USP9X depletion on DNA replication is almost indistinguishable from the direct downregulation of CLASPIN itself, suggesting
that CLASPIN is the main target of USP9X in the process of DNA
replication. This idea is further reinforced by the fact that the
amount of DNA damage in USP9X-depleted cells, likely accumulating because of fork instability, is partially rescued by ectopic
expression of CLASPIN.
Our experiments demonstrate that USP9X depletion decreases
levels of endogenous CLASPIN in a proteasome-dependent manner and increases the rate of CLASPIN degradation. Furthermore,
we ﬁnd that the two proteins can be coimmunoprecipitated, and
that CLASPIN stabilization requires the catalytic activity of
USP9X, suggesting that CLASPIN is very likely a bona ﬁde in vivo
substrate of USP9X. USP9X is mostly a cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein (30); however, a small fraction has been
reported to be nuclear (46). We reconﬁrmed these ﬁndings by
immunoﬂuorescence experiments and we found that some
USP9X can accumulate in the nucleus of U2OS cells when nuclear
export is inhibited (Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8). It is tempting
to speculate that some USP9X activity may play a direct role at
replication forks and in agreement with this idea a proteomic
study reported that USP9X, such as CLASPIN, is preferentially
found associated with nascent chromatin compared with mature
postreplicative chromatin (47).

McGarry et al.

It is intriguing that four different deubiquitinases, USP7,
USP29, USP20, and USP9X target the same protein in a nonredundant manner. As depletion of USP9X does not alter the
protein levels of any of these DUBs and vice versa, it is possible
that each DUB may be involved in limiting CLASPIN ubiquitinylation at different speciﬁc sites on the protein thus allowing
multiple layers of regulation to be independently imposed on
CLASPIN.
Consistent with a dual role for CLASPIN at replication forks and
as a mediator of checkpoint signaling, USP9X depletion decreases,
but does not abolish CHK1 activation in response to HU and UV
and leads to hypersensitivity to drug-induced replication stress.
Increased DNA damage and a diminished ability to promote
efﬁcient checkpoint signaling may also be the reason for the
hypersensitivity to other genotoxic agents such 5-ﬂuorouracil in
USP9X-deﬁcient colorectal cancer cells (48).
Inhibition of USP9X either as single agent or in combination
with other drugs has been suggested as therapeutic strategy for
several leukemias and solid tumors, however, most of the studies
focused on the role of USP9X in the stabilization of the antiapoptotic protein MCL1 (35) and on the increased rate of apoptosis. In our study, we did not observe an obvious increase in
apoptotic cell death by siRNA-mediated USP9X depletion and the
additive effects of USP9X depletion with HU were only revealed
with clonogenic assays that have long-term endpoints. This highlights the possibility that excessive genome instability may be the
main reason of the loss of the proliferative capability in our
cellular models.
Interestingly, in pancreatic cancer USP9X acts as a tumor
suppressor by limiting K-RAS induced cellular transformation
and by suppressing tumor aggressiveness by a mechanism that
still requires further understanding (32). It is tempting to speculate that the protection of replication forks and protection from
DNA damage could be an important factor in the tumor suppressor role of USP9X.
In conclusion, we propose that USP9X, by regulating CLASPIN,
is a novel player in the replication of the genome, in the DNA
damage/replication checkpoint and its function is important for
the maintenance of genomic stability. Further studies in systems

that more closely recapitulate human cancers, both in vitro and in
vivo, will be required to understand how this novel function of
USP9X contributes to either cancer development or to the outcome of treatments targeting the DNA replication process and/or
the integrity of DNA.
