Abstract
Genomic alterations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene play a crucial role in pathogenesis of
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By systematic analysis of GBM genomic data, we have identiﬁed and
characterized a novel exon 27 deletion mutation occurring within the EGFR carboxyl-terminus domain (CTD),
in addition to identifying additional examples of previously reported deletion mutations in this region. We show
that the GBM-derived EGFR CTD deletion mutants are able to induce cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo in
the absence of ligand and receptor autophosphorylation. Treatment with the EGFR-targeted monoclonal
antibody, cetuximab, or the small molecule EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, effectively impaired tumorigenicity of
oncogenic EGFR CTD deletion mutants. Cetuximab in particular prolonged the survival of intracranially
xenografted mice with oncogenic EGFR CTD deletion mutants, compared with untreated control mice. Therefore,
we propose that erlotinib and, especially, cetuximab treatment may be a promising therapeutic strategy in GBM
patients harboring EGFR CTD deletion mutants. Cancer Res; 71(24); 7587–96. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common type
of malignant brain tumors. There are approximately 9,000 new
cases diagnosed every year in the United States (1, 2). Due to the
resistant nature of GBM to available therapeutic modalities,
such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, the median
survival of patients diagnosed with GBM is only about 14
months (3, 4). Thus, it is critical to develop new effective

therapeutic approaches to treat patients with this devastating
disease.
Numerous studies, including recent large-scale genomic
analyses, have identiﬁed epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine
kinases, as a common genetically altered gene in primary GBM
(5–10). Different classes of EGFR somatic mutations have been
identiﬁed in GBM. These include the exon 2 to 7 deletion, which
is known as variant III (EGFRvIII), and point mutations within
the extracellular domain of EGFR (11–14). These genetic
alterations have been shown to lead to oncogenic activation
of the mutant receptor independent of ligand stimulation and,
consequently, induce cellular transformation (14–16). In addition, various exon deletion mutations including exon 25 to 27
and exon 25 to 28 deletion mutations, which result in the
truncation of the C-terminal domain of EGFR, have been
identiﬁed in GBM patients, although their oncogenic potential
has not yet been characterized (17, 18). Furthermore, EGFR
gene ampliﬁcation and/or EGFR protein overexpression commonly occur in approximately 50% of GBM patients, suggesting
that an increased abundance of the EGFR may also be responsible for tumorigenesis in primary GBM (7, 19). Interestingly,
somatic mutations within the EGFR kinase domain, which are
frequently identiﬁed in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
have only rarely been identiﬁed in GBM (8, 14, 20).
Given that abnormal regulation of downstream signaling
pathways such as PI3K/Akt, Ras/Erk, and/or STAT5 originating from mutant EGFR seem to play a crucial role in pathogenesis of GBM, targeting oncogenic EGFR with small molecule kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies (mAb) has
been tested as a therapeutic approach (21–23). Clinical trials

with either erlotinib or geﬁtinib as a single agent therapy reveal
that these drugs do not have additional clinical beneﬁt over
standard treatment regimens in unselected patients who have
not been characterized for genomic alterations of EGFR (24,
25). Interestingly, a retrospective genetic analysis study with
GBM patient tumor samples indicates that the clinical
response to erlotinib is closely associated with coexpression
of EGFRvIII and PTEN (26). This is consistent with the consensus that genetic factors in tumors may determine their
clinical response, and identifying these genetic biomarkers is
the key for successful targeted therapy with EGFR small
molecule inhibitors. Cetuximab, a humanized mAb, has been
shown to be effective against GBM cell lines and in vivo
xenograft mouse model as monotherapy or in combination
with radiation or chemotherapy (27–29). However, only a
single case study has reported the clinical effectiveness of
cetuximab among GBM patients (30).
In this study, through genomic analysis of primary GBM
patient samples collected under The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), we have conﬁrmed deletion mutations within the Cterminal domain of EGFR and have further identiﬁed novel Cterminal deletion mutations. In addition, we showed that the
resulting C-terminal deletion mutants of EGFR are oncogenic
in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we showed that erlotinib and
cetuximab inhibited the growth of tumors driven by C-terminal
deletion EGFR mutants, indicating that both small molecule
inhibitors and anti-EGFR mAbs may be promising therapeutic
approaches in treating GBM patients with tumors harboring
such deletions.

Materials and Methods
Exon and copy number array analysis
RMA data from Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays and
segmented and level 2 copy number data from SNP 6.0 arrays
were batch-downloaded from the TCGA data portal (http://
tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaCancerDetails.jsp?diseaseType
¼glioblastoma%multiforme). Exon expression data from
tumor-derived RNA were normalized to exon expression data
from total brain control RNA, and probes interrogating expression of EGFR exons 25 through 28 were compared with the
average of those for EGFR exons 17 through 20. Segmented
data were searched for tumor DNA copy number proﬁles with
EGFR ampliﬁcations that contain segmentation breaks
between exons 24 and 27 (chromosome 7 55269049 to
55270209), in which the copy number of the 30 segment was
lower than that of the 50 segment. With level 2 copy number
data, the copy number probe closest to exon 27 (CN_1227312)
was compared with probes both 50 and 30 of exons 17 and exon
20. For more details, see Supplementary Information Materials
and Methods.
Expression constructs
pBabe-puro plasmids encoding CT982NT, CT1054NT, and
CT Del1 EGFR mutants were generated using the QuikChange
site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with wild-type EGFR
as a template (31). The expression construct for the EGFRvIII
mutant was previously described (32).

Cell culture and generation of cell lines by viral
transduction
All EGFR mutant expressing cell lines (Ba/F3, NIH-3T3, and
LN443 cells) used in the study were established by retroviral
infections, pooled and maintained as described previously
(31, 33, 34). EGFR CT Del1 mutant were identiﬁed in the
wild-type EGFR expressing Ba/F3 cell clone that grew after
IL-3 withdrawal (see text for more detail).
Cell growth inhibition assay
For growth inhibition assays, Ba/F3 cells (10,000 cells) were
plated in 180 mL media in 96-well ﬂat-bottom plates (Corning).
Twenty-four hours after plating, cell culture media was
replaced with medium with and without either erlotinib or
cetuximab. The concentrations of erlotinib and cetuximab
used for the assay ranged from 3.3 to 10 mmol/L or from 33
ng/mL to 100 mg/mL, respectively. The cells were incubated for
another 72 hours and the viable cell numbers were measured
using Cell Counting Kit-8 solution (Dojindo). Absorbance was
measured at 450 nm after 3 hours. Data are expressed as
percentage of growth relative to that of untreated control cells.
Immunoblotting and antibodies
Cells were lysed in immunoblotting (31) buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem) and subjected to immunoblotting. AntiEGFR (Ab-5) antibody was purchased from NeoMarker.
Anti–phospho-tyrosine antibody (4G10) and anti-actin were
from Millipore and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively.
Ab against phospho-Stat5 (Y705) was from Cell Signaling
Biotechnology.
Generation of xenografted mice, erlotinib and
cetuximab treatment
Animal [severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice (SCID)
mice] studies done in accordance with UCSD IACUC protocols.
For subcutaneous studies, cells were resuspended in PBS and 1
to 2 million cells were injected in the ﬂanks of mice, and both
cetuximab and erlotinib administration was initiated approximately 20 days after tumor cell inoculation, when the tumors
had reached a diameter of 50 to 70 mm3. For intracranial
studies, cells were resuspended in PBS at concentration of 2 
105 viable cells/5 mL and implanted into right striatum, as
previously described, using stereotactic apparatus, and the
drug administration was initiated after 1 week (35). Cetuximab
and erlotinib were obtained from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute pharmacy. For the cetuximab-treated mice, we administered 1 mg per mouse of cetuximab by intra-peritoneal injection to the mice 3 times per week, and for the erlotinib-treated
mice, we orally administered 1 mg per mouse of erlotinib 3
times per week. Mice were sacriﬁced when morbid and the date
was recorded for survival analysis.
Pathology and immunohistochemistry analysis
All orthotopic xenograft tissue was ﬁxed by host perfusion
with phosphate buffered 4% formalin, followed by additional
ﬁxation in formalin after brain removal, dehydration by graded
ethanols, and embedding in wax (Paraplast Plus; McCormick

Results
Identiﬁcation and validation of EGFR C-terminal
deletion mutants by exon array analysis in human GBM
patients
On the basis of reports of somatic genome rearrangements
in the region encoding the EGFR C-terminal domain (CTD) in
GBM (17, 18), we examined the region of chromosome 7 from
55.268 to 55.276 Mb (hg19) systematically by analyzing
SNP 6.0 array copy number and exon array expression data
(http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaCancerDetails.jsp?
diseaseType¼glioblastoma%multiforme) from GBM patient
samples in the TCGA database (5, 8). We identiﬁed candidate
deletions by the presence of either (i) copy number segment
boundaries following EGFR exon 24, in which the segmented
copy number of the 30 segment was at least 1.5 normalized
copies lower than that of the 50 segment, or (ii) expression
values for 1 or more of EGFR exons 25 through 28 that was less
than one-half the average expression value of EGFR exons
17 through 20. Where this approach identiﬁed deletions
based on expression but not segmented copy number data,
we analyzed raw single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array
data for the presence of a reduction in copy number of at least
1.5 normalized copies on probe CN_1227312, the copy number probe closest to exon 27 (see Supplementary Materials
and Methods).
By these analyses, we found a total of 8 samples of 469
analyzed (7 of 435 samples from exon array analysis and 6 of
447 samples from SNP array analysis) showing evidence of
EGFR C-terminal exonic deletions (Supplementary Table S1).
The 8 samples with candidate EGFR C-terminal deletions can
be divided into 4 categories, including previously reported
exon 25 to 27 deletions, previously reported exon 25 to 28
deletions (18), hitherto unreported exon 27 deletions, and
hitherto unreported exon 27 to 28 deletions.
To conﬁrm candidate events, we carried out quantitative
PCR (qPCR) analysis of genomic DNA using speciﬁc primers
targeting exon 23 to 28 on 5 of the 8 samples for which
sufﬁcient DNA was available. These assays conﬁrmed exon
25 to 28 deletions in 3 samples (TCGA 06-0216, TCGA 08-0511,
and TCGA 08-0356), an exon 25 to 27 deletion in 1 sample
(TCGA 02-0043), and an exon 27 deletion in 1 sample (TCGA 02-

0102; Fig. 1A). By PCR ampliﬁcation with intronic primers from
genomic DNA followed by amplicon sequencing, we further
validated the exon 27 and exon 25 to 27 deletions in the relevant
samples and mapped the breakpoints of these deletions (Fig.
1B). Because the deletion of exon 27 has not been previously
reported, we sequenced cDNA from sample TCGA 02-0102 and
conﬁrmed that the EGFR exon 27 deletion results in the
transcription of an aberrant mRNA, consistent with a splice
between exon 26 and exon 28 (Fig. 1B). However, we could not
validate Ex25–28 deletion mutants using the same approach
because we were unable to determine the 30 breakpoint of these
deletion mutants. Instead, we mapped the 50 breakpoint of
Ex25–28 deletion mutants (TCGA 08-0511 and TCGA 08-0356)
approximately within intron 24 using qPCR based analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Thus, we believe that mutants
harboring deletions within intron 24 likely result in aberrant
transcripts missing Ex25–28 and containing a newly generated
stop codon within exon 24, leading to an EGFR CTD deletion
protein (Fig 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1C).
In summary, we validated C-terminal EGFR deletions in the 5
tested GBM samples including a novel exon 27 deletion, as well
as the previously identiﬁed exon 25 to 27 and exon 25 to 28
deletions (Fig. 1C).
GBM-derived CT982NT and CT1054NT mutants are
oncogenic
To explore the functional signiﬁcance of GBM-derived EGFR
CTD deletion mutants, we ﬁrst generated retroviral vectors to
express cDNA encoding the protein products of 3 EGFR
mutants, CT982NT, CT1054NT, and Ex25–28 deletion. These
mutants were stably introduced into Ba/F3 cells by retroviral
infection, along with the highly prevalent oncogenic EGFRvIII
mutant as a positive control. We used the Ba/F3 pro-B cell line
as a model system for 2 reasons. First, the survival and
proliferation of Ba/F3 cells are strictly dependent on IL-3, but
ectopic oncogene expression relieves this dependency; thus, we
can not only determine the oncogenic activity of the EGFR CTD
deletion mutants by assessing whether the forced expression of
these mutants in Ba/F3 cells can functionally replace IL-3
dependency but can also use these cells as an efﬁcient system
to test drug sensitivity, which has been highly predictive for
clinical efﬁcacy of speciﬁc EGFR mutants (36). Second, as Ba/
F3 cells are known to express low to undetectable levels of
endogenous ErbB proteins (37), the biological consequences of
EGFR expression in the engineered Ba/F3 cells are likely due to
the isogenically expressed EGFR mutants.
Ba/F3 cells expressing the CT982NT, CT1054NT, vIII
mutants, or Ex25–28 deletion of EGFR were able to grow in
the absence of IL-3, whereas the control parental Ba/F3 cell line
failed to grow under the same conditions (Fig. 2A and data not
shown). The IL-3–independent cell growth ability of Ba/F3
cells expressing the CT982NT mutant is comparable with that
induced by oncogenic EGFRvIII mutant and higher than that of
CT1054NT. Furthermore, although the EGFRvIII mutant
underwent constitutive phosphorylation, we did not observe
any detectable level of phosphorylation for the C-terminal
deletion mutants, which is unsurprising as these mutants have
deleted the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of EGFR

early termination (red solid arrow). Deletion of exons 25 to 27 also resulted in the addition of N and T after amino acid 982 followed by a stop codon (red solid

(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1B). Consistent with the
results in Ba/F3 cells, NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing either
CT982NT or CT1054NT mutants, but not vector-infected cells,
were able to grow in an anchorage-independent manner in soft
agar, a hallmark of cellular transformation, in the absence of
ligands (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Taken together, we concluded that GBM patient–derived
CT982NT and CT1054NT EGFR mutants are oncogenic in vitro
and are able to induce cellular transformation.
Tumors induced by EGFR CTD deletion mutants are
sensitive to EGFR inhibitors
The clinical effectiveness of anti-EGFR–targeted therapy
with small molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors, such as erlotinib,
or mAbs, such as cetuximab, have been successfully proven in a
subset of cancer types including NSCLC and colorectal cancer
(38, 39). Therefore, we sought to determine the efﬁcacy of these

7590

drugs against the oncogenic EGFR CTD deletion mutants. Both
erlotinib and cetuximab were able to effectively suppress the
growth of Ba/F3 cells transformed by either the CT982NT or
CT1054NT or Ex25–28 deletion EGFR mutants in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3A and B and Supplementary Fig.
S1C). In contrast, the same drugs showed no inhibitory effects
on the parental Ba/F3 cells in the presence of IL-3. Consistent
with this result, erlotinib and cetuximab decreased the constitutive phosphorylation of Stat5 in both CT982NT and
CT1054NT expressing Ba/F3 cell lines, but not in the parental
cells, suggesting that these drugs speciﬁcally target the EGFR
CTD deletion mutants and effectively inhibit their oncogenic
activity (Supplementary Fig. S2B and data not shown).
To further investigate the in vivo efﬁcacy of erlotinib and
cetuximab, we extended our study to xenografted mice generated by subcutaneous injection of nontumorigenic LN443 glioma cell lines engineered to stably express either wild-type

amino acids 1,010 to 1,152. This mutation was discovered in
an IL-3–independent clone that grew from a pool of Ba/F3 cells
in which wild-type EGFR, which normally does not transform
Ba/F3 cell, was introduced by retroviral infection (Supplementary Fig. S3A; ref. 33). EGFR was sequenced from the transformed Ba/F3 clone and found to have undergone an intragenic deletion. Reexpression of the cDNA encoding this mutant
EGFR (CT Del1) transformed the parental Ba/F3 cell line as
well as NIH-3T3 cells in the absence of ligand (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). These results conﬁrmed that the oncogenic activation of EGFR is most likely induced by a deletion occurring
within the CTD of the ectopically introduced EGFR in the cells
and may be a direct cause of clonal selection from IL-3
withdrawal. As for the CT982NT and CT1054NT EGFR
mutants, both IL-3–independent cell proliferation and the
growth of mouse tumors driven by the oncogenic CT Del1
EGFR mutant are signiﬁcantly suppressed by cetuximab or
erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D). Taken together,
these results showed that similar to GBM-derived CT982NT
and CT1054NT mutants, the CT Del1 mutant is oncogenically
activated by EGFR CTD deletion, and its oncogenic activity is
effectively suppressed by either cetuximab or erlotinib.

(34). Consistent with the results of the in vitro studies, we found
that tumors were formed in xenografted mice harboring LN443
cells expressing either CT982NT or CT1054NT mutants. The
sizes of the resulting tumors were signiﬁcantly reduced in mice
treated with either erlotinib or cetuximab, compared with
tumor size in untreated mice (Fig. 3C and D). No tumors were
observed in the mice injected with wild-type EGFR expressing
cells (data not shown). These results showed that GBM-derived
EGFR CTD deletion mutants are tumorigenic and that tumors
driven by these mutants exhibit a signiﬁcant response to
erlotinib and cetuximab treatment.

CTD deletion mutant harboring an intragenic deletion of

Antitumor effect of cetuximab and erlotinib against
orthotopic xenografted brain tumors driven by EGFR
CTD deletion mutants
Next, we wanted to further investigate the efﬁcacy of cetuximab and erlotinib treatment as therapeutic approaches in
treating GBM patients harboring EGFR CTD deletion mutants.
To this end, we ﬁrst generated orthotopic mouse models by
intracranially implanting LN443 cells stably expressing oncogenic CT Del1, EGFRvIII mutants, or wild-type EGFR. We chose
the CT Del1 mutant as a representative of various oncogenic
EGFR CTD deletion mutants for in vivo mouse study because
unlike the CT982NT or CT1054NT mutants, CT Del1 mutant
undergoes detectable constitutive phosphorylation at 2 tyrosine residues, Tyr1172 and Tyr1196, within the residual Cterminal segment of the mutant protein (Supplementary Fig.
S4). Therefore, we can determine whether the enzymatic
activation of the ectopically introduced EGFR CT Del1 mutant
is responsible for tumorigenesis by monitoring its phosphorylation in tumors of the xenografted mice.
One week after tumor cell implantation, we assigned the
xenografted mice to 3 different groups—no treatment, cetuximab treatment, and erlotinib treatment (Fig. 4A). For the
cetuximab-treated mice, we administered 1 mg per mouse of
cetuximab by intraperitoneal injection to the mice 3 times per
week, and for the erlotinib-treated mice, we administered 1 mg
per mouse of erlotinib by gavage 3 times per week. Consistent
with the results from the subcutaneously xenografted mouse
model and the in vitro study, whereas all mice subject to
intracranial xenografts of LN443 cells expressing wild-type
EGFR survived, the mice xenografted with LN443 cells expressing EGFRvIII or CT Del1 died early because of tumor formation in the brain (Fig. 4B). Immunohistochemical analysis
revealed that both total and phosphorylated EGFR were speciﬁcally detected in brain tumors from EGFRvIII and CT Del1
mutant mice, showing that these tumors were indeed induced

Figure 3. CT982NT and CT1054NT oncogenic EGFR mutants are sensitive to erlotinib or cetuximab in vivo and in vitro. A and B, growth of Ba/F3
cells transformed with either CT982NT or CT1054NT EGFR mutant, but not the parental line with IL-3, was suppressed by either erlotinib (A) or cetuximab (B).
Cells were treated with either erlotinib or cetuximab at the concentrations indicated for 72 hours and assayed for cell viability. The results are indicated as
mean  SD of 3 independent experiments. C and D, growth of mouse tumors driven by CT982NT and CT1054NT EGFR mutants are signiﬁcantly
suppressed by either erlotinib or cetuximab. LN443 cells expressing CT982NT (C) and CT1054NT (D) mutants were subcutaneously injected in the ﬂanks of
3
SCID mice (5 mice per group and 3 sites per each mouse). Twenty days after cell injection, when tumors reached a size around 50 to 70 mm , either erlotinib
(50 mg/kg, gavage) or cetuximab (50 mg/kg, IP) was administered 3 times per week for 13 weeks. Tumor size was measured once a week, and volume was
determined according to the formula (W2  L)/2. IP, intraperitoneal.

by constitutive enzymatic activation of ectopically expressed
EGFRvIII or CT Del1 mutants (Fig. 4C).
We then tested the effects of cetuximab and erlotinib on
survival of mice xenografted with LN443 cells expressing the
various forms of EGFR. Given the lack of tumorigenicity by
LN443 cells expressing wild-type EGFR, there was no decrease
in survival for mice xenografted with these cells (Fig. 4D),
although the mice xenografted with LN443 cells expressing the
EGFR mutants exhibited diminished survival, with a median of
79.5 days for the EGFRvIII and 55.5 days for the EGFR CT Del1
deletion (Fig. 4E and F).
With the tested dose of cetuximab, 90% (17 of 19) of the
cetuximab-treated xenograft mice with oncogenic EGFR
mutants survived for the 92-day duration of the treatment
(Fig. 4E and F). These results showed that cetuximab exerted
strong pharmacologic effects against brain tumors driven by
oncogenic CT Del1 mutant as well as EGFRvIII mutant. In
contrast to cetuximab, we observed that erlotinib had no
statistically signiﬁcant effect on survival of mice engrafted
with LN443 cells expressing the EGFRvIII mutant, with median
survival of 84 days for erlotinib treatment versus 79.5 days for
untreated control mice engrafted with the same cells, respectively (P ¼ 0.63; Fig. 4E) and only modestly improved the
survival of the mice xenografted with LN443 cells expressing
the EGFR CT Del1 mutant (55.5 vs. 60.5 days, P ¼ 0.04; Fig. 4F).
These results showed that cetuximab is more potent in vivo
than erlotinib at the tested concentrations for preventing
growth of tumors driven by EGFR CTD deletions.

Given that there was a signiﬁcant antitumor effect in the
cetuximab-treated xenograft mice with the EGFR CTD deletion
mutants, we wanted to further study the long-term antitumor
response of cetuximab in these mice. To this end, we divided
the cetuximab-treated xenograft mice harboring CT Del1
mutant into 2 groups—in one group (5 mice), we discontinued
cetuximab treatment for 60 days after the initial cetuximab
treatment of 92 days, whereas in the other group (5 mice), we
continued to administer the same dose of cetuximab as
described above. Interestingly, the cetuximab-treated mice
continued to survive for more than 60 days after the discontinuation of cetuximab treatment. Upon further investigation,
we observed that none of the mice in either group had any sign
of a brain tumor, suggesting that cetuximab may eradicate the
tumors or prevent initial tumor formation after xenografting
(data not shown).

Discussion
We here report both previously described (17, 18) and novel
C-terminal deletion mutations of EGFR in GBM specimens.
Furthermore, we showed that LN443 cells expressing an EGFR
C-terminal deletion mutant form brain tumors in an intracranial mouse model. The survival of these xenografted mice was
signiﬁcantly prolonged by treatment with erlotinib or more
potently by cetuximab. On the basis of our preclinical studies,
we concluded that therapeutic targeting of EGFR with cetuximab may be a promising clinical approach to treat GBM

Figure 4. Anti-EGFR therapy is effective against brain tumors induced by oncogenic EGFR CTD deletion mutants. A, schematic to show the generation
of the intracranial xenograft mouse model and the timing of anti-EGFR drug treatment. The indicated numbers of SCID mice were implanted intracranially with
LN443 cells stably expressing either wild-type EGFR, EGFRvIII, or CT Del1 mutants. After 1 week, each mutant group of xenografted mice was
assigned to receive either no treatment or erlotinib or cetuximab 3 times per week with the dose indicated in the schematic. B, representative images of excised
brains from the untreated group of mice xenografted with LN443 cells expressing wild-type EGFR or the EGFRvIII or CT Del1 mutants, respectively.
C, EGFRvIII and CT Del1 mutants are expressed and active in brain tumors originated from xenografted mice, whereas wild-type EGFR is neither detected nor
active. Brain tumor sections prepared from no treatment group of xenograft mice of wild-type EGFR or EGFRvIII or CT Del1 mutants were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E; top) stain or antibodies to total EGFR (middle) or phospho-EGFR (Tyr1197; bottom). D–F, cetuximab treatment prolongs
survival of xenografted mice with oncogenic EGFR CT Del1 mutant as well as EGFRvIII mutant. The survival of treated or nontreated groups of xenografted
mice described in (A) were monitored and depicted as a Kaplan–Meier curve (M.S, median survival). P values were calculated between nontreated and
drug-treated mouse groups.

patients harboring tumors with EGFR C-terminal deletion
mutants. In addition, identiﬁcation of EGFR C-terminal deletions is likely to be an important biomarker for selection of
targeted therapy for GBM patients.
Compared with the previous reports (17, 18), a relatively
lower frequency of EGFR CTD deletion mutations was detected
among GBM tumors in this study. One possible reason for this
discrepancy is the use of distinct experimental approaches to
achieve different study goals. We sought to identify any potential novel CT deletion mutation in addition to previous known
mutations by systematic analysis of the preexisting TCGA
genomic data sets. Thus, we applied stringent analytic parameters for selecting the potential CTD deletion mutations.
Expanding upon previous ﬁndings, we were able to identify the

www.aacrjournals.org

novel Ex27 deletions among GBM tumors and pursued further
functional characterization of the mutants using in vivo and in
vitro models. It is noted that 4 of 5 tumors (TCGA 02-0102, 020043, 06-02511, and 08-0356) with mutant EGFR genes harboring CTD deletion exhibit high ampliﬁcation at EGFR and do not
harbor any other EGFR mutation (data not shown).
The detailed molecular mechanism underlying cellular
transformation by EGFR C-terminal deletion mutants is currently unknown. Ligand-independent heterodimerization of
EGFR CTD deletion mutants with other endogenous ErbB
family members and/or Met receptors is unlikely to contribute
to oncogenic activity of these mutants, as we did not observe
detectable levels of total or phosphorylated forms of ErbB2,
ErbB3, ErbB4, or Met in cells transformed by EGFR CTD

deletion mutants (data not shown). In contrast to wild-type
EGFR, we found that degradation of EGFRvIII mutant and
EGFR CTD deletion mutants in response to EGF stimulation
was diminished (Supplementary Fig. S5). As suggested in
previous studies, this observation could be due to a low level
of receptor internalization of EGFR CTD deletion mutant and/
or lack of Y1069 phosphorylation on the mutant EGFR, which is
required for Cbl-mediated receptor proteolysis (40, 41). Therefore, dysregulation of receptor degradation could be one of the
possible oncogenic mechanisms of EGFR CTD deletion mutant,
which is consistent with previous reports (42, 43). In addition,
the CTD deletion mutants may have altered EGFR substrate
speciﬁcity/receptor degradation or no longer bind regulatory
proteins including Mig6, which has been found to negatively
regulate EGFR kinase activity by blocking the activating dimer
interface (44–46). Further experiments are needed to test these
possibilities and to characterize a detailed mechanism of
oncogenic activation of EGFR CTD deletion mutants.
We found that the levels of phosphorylation of the major
EGFR downstream signaling mediators including STAT3,
STAT5, Shc, and Akt were increased in the cells expressing
EGF-stimulated EGFR CTD deletion mutants, suggesting that
the enzymatic activity of these mutants are able to be further
enhanced by ligand, unlike EGFRvIII mutant in the absence of
autophosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S6). Interestingly,
the robust induction of phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5,
and Shc were observed speciﬁcally among EGFR CTD deletion
mutants, whereas high levels of Src phosphorylation were
detected on the EGFRvIII mutant (Supplementary Fig. S6),
suggesting that the EGFR CTD deletion mutants may activate
different downstream signaling pathways compared with
EGFRvIII and wild-type EGFR. Further investigation will be
needed to validate this possibility. Given that both CT1054NT
and CT Del1 mutants are oncogenic, we hypothesized that the
region between amino acids 1,055 and 1,152 may play an
important role in inhibiting ligand-independent activation of
EGFR. This hypothesis is further supported by recent reports
that EGFR CTD modulates kinase domain dimer formation
required for enzymatic activation of EGFR (47, 48).
Our in vivo studies showed that erlotinib and, more potently,
cetuximab affected the tumorigenicity of the oncogenic EGFR
CTD deletion mutants in mouse xenograft models. However, it
is not clear whether the prolonged survival of mice observed in
the intracranial mouse model is derived from direct antitumor

effect of the drug against established mouse tumors or blockage of initial tumor formation. Given that the results using our
subcutaneous mouse model clearly showed that both drugs
effectively diminished growth of established tumors, we believe
that eradication of mouse brain tumors in cetuximab-treated
intracranial mice is likely due to the direct killing effect of drug
on tumor cells formed by oncogenic EGFR mutants. Considering the translational impact of this distinction for potential
clinical utility, it should be more clearly addressed by additional in vivo experiments in future.
Previous studies have suggested that cetuximab may exert
antitumor effects via immune responses, promoting receptor
degradation, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(49). In addition, prevention of receptor activation by directly
blocking ligand binding and/or indirectly blocking the receptor
dimerization was proposed as a possible pharmacologic mechanism of cetuximab (50). Given that the degradation of CTD
deletion mutants is impaired (42, 43), we believe that receptor
degradation may not be a major mechanistic role of dramatic
antitumor effects of cetuximab against EGFR CT deletion
mutants in our model systems. The relative contribution of
each mechanism is currently under investigation.
