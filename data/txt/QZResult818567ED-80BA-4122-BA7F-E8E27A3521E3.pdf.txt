Abstract

Author Manuscript

Resveratrol (RSV) is reported to extend life span1,2 and provide cardio-neuro-protective3, antidiabetic4, and anti-cancer effects3,5 by initiating a stress response2 that induces survival genes.
Because human tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) translocates to the nucleus under stress
conditions6, we considered the possibility that the tyrosine-like phenolic ring of RSV might fit into
the active site pocket to effect a nuclear role. Here we present a 2.1Å co-crystal structure of RSV
bound to the active site of TyrRS. RSV nullified the catalytic activity and redirected TyrRS to a
nuclear function, stimulating NAD+-dependent auto-poly-ADP-ribosylation of PARP-1.
Downstream activation of key stress signaling pathways were causally connected to TyrRSPARP-1-NAD+ collaboration. This collaboration was also demonstrated in the mouse, and was
specifically blocked in vivo by a RSV-displacing tyrosyl adenylate analog. In contrast to
functionally diverse tRNA synthetase catalytic nulls created by alternative splicing events that
ablate active sites7, here a non-spliced TyrRS catalytic null reveals a new PARP-1- and NAD+dependent dimension to the physiological mechanism of RSV.

Human TyrRS is a homodimer of a 528 amino acid polypeptide that harbors an appended
eukaryote-specific C-terminal EMAP-II domain (Fig. 1a)8,9. High-resolution structures of
the catalytic unit of Hs TyrRS, known as mini-TyrRS, and the C-domain have been
determined10,11. We found RSV strongly inhibited TyrRS with a Ki-value of 22 μM
(Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). Crystallization of Hs mini-TyrRS with RSV and, separately,
with tyrosine yielded co-crystal structures (at 2.1Å) (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b

RSV forces a local structural change near the linker to the C-domain (Fig. 1b, Extended
Data Fig. 2a). An RSV-promoted conformational change in TyrRS may drive the
predominant trans RSV (in solution) into a cis conformation. (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d).

Author Manuscript

Associated with a previous study12, a distinct TyrRS-PARP-1 interaction was observed.
PARP-1 is a major modulator of NAD+ metabolism and its related signaling13. Because
RSV acts through NAD+-dependent proteins14, the TyrRS-PARP-1 interaction was further
studied. Given that RSV treatment elicits a stress response2, serum starvation (SS) was used
to mimic a general ‘stand-alone’ stress condition so that common signaling pathways, if any,
between RSV treatment and a general stress condition, could be compared ex-vivo. Either
serum starvation or RSV treatment promoted nuclear translocation of endogenous TyrRS in
HeLa cells (Fig. 1c). Translocation was observed under different stress conditions (heat
shock and ER stress, Extended Data Fig. 3a), suggesting that TyrRS is a general stress
transducer. Nuclear translocation of endogenous TyrRS was concomitant with strong autoPARylation of PARP-1 (PARP-1PAR) (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3a).
Ex-vivo RSV also strongly promoted association of TyrRS with PARP-1, and robust autopoly-ADP-ribosylation of PARP-1 (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Effects of RSV were blocked
by a Tyr-AMP analog (Tyr-SA (5′-O-[N-(9L-tyrosyl) sulfamoyl] adenosine)), but not by
Gly-SA (a control targeting GlyRS) (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Similar, but less pronounced,
PARylation was seen with serum starvation. Enhanced PARylation correlated with increased
amounts of TyrRS in the nucleus, which occurred upon serum starvation. Thus, both serum
starvation and RSV promoted nuclear translocation of TyrRS and activation of PARP-1.

Author Manuscript

Cell lysates treated with the PARG hydrolyase and its hydrolase-inactive mutant supported
that TyrRS preferentially bound to non-PARylated PARP-1 (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e).
TyrRS interacted specifically with the C-domain of PARP-1 (CT-PARP-1) (Extended Data
Fig. 3f). Neither mini-TyrRS nor the TyrRS C-domain interacted with PARP-1; only fulllength native TyrRS bound PARP-1 (Extended Data Fig. 3g,h). In the absence of RSV,
concentration-dependent activation of PARP-1 by TyrRS was observed in vitro (Fig. 2a, top,
Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). RSV enhanced in-vitro auto-PARylation with the half-maximal
effect at roughly 10 nM (Fig. 2a, middle), well below the Ki (about 22 μM) in Extended
Data Figure 1a–c. Thus, PARP-1 may alter the apparent affinity of RSV for TyrRS. Also,
concentration-dependent quenching of PARylation of PARP-1 by Tyr-SA was evident (Fig.
2a, bottom). Lastly, while broken DNA normally activates PARP-113, Tyr-SA did not
interfere with this DNA-dependent-pathway of PARP-1 activation in vitro (Extended Data
Fig. 4c). Therefore, TyrRS-RSV activation of PARP-1 is distinct.

Author Manuscript

Ectopically expressed TyrRS in HeLa cells for 0–24 h caused progressive increase in
cellular concentrations of the synthetase (Fig. 2b, top) and a correlated progressive increase
in PARP-1PAR (Fig. 2b, top). A TyrRS mutant (TyrRS-dNLS), with reduced nuclear
localization6, reduced activation of PARP-1 (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Effects of RSV exvivo at various concentrations (Fig. 2b, middle) and of Tyr-SA (Fig. 2b, bottom) mirrored
those seen in vitro (Fig. 2a, middle and bottom).

RSV and L-tyrosine produce different bound conformations of TyrRS, seen locally in the
high-resolution structures of the two co-crystals (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a). These
differences could affect the disposition of the C-domain needed for the interaction of TyrRS
with PARP-1. This domain is tethered to the mini-TyrRS catalytic unit by a flexible linker
(Fig. 2c, left). By breaking the Y341 OH--H-bond to a backbone carbonyl oxygen, a Y341A
mutation releases tight tethering of the C-domain to the catalytic domain15 and its
reorientation16 (Fig. 2c, right).

Author Manuscript

In the absence of RSV, Y341A-TyrRS showed robust interaction with and activation of
PARP-1 in vitro (Fig. 2d). If Y341A is shifted more towards a conformation needed to bind
to PARP-1, then it would be more sensitive than WT TyrRS to low concentrations of RSV.
This expectation was fulfilled (Extended Data Fig. 4e). TyrRS-Tyr may thus have a
conformation that prevents interaction with PARP-1, while TyrRS-RSV has a distinct
conformation that binds PARP-1. In the absence of either ligand, a dynamic equilibrium
populates both forms (Fig. 2c).

Author Manuscript

A working model of downstream signaling markers was developed as detailed in Methods
(Fig. 3a). Effects from serum starvation and RSV administration involve cascades through
protein acetylation and phosphorylation effects of serum starvation and of RSV, which have
not been linked to TyrRS nor activation of PARP-1. Under conditions of serum starvation or
RSV administration, the response in HeLa cells of PARylated and acetylated proteins,
together with the aforementioned cell-signaling proteins, was monitored for up to 1h. Either
RSV or serum-starvation promoted production of AcK-Tip60 and AcK-ATM (Fig. 3b). In a
temporal response from 0 to 8 h, either or both of serum starvation or 1 μM RSV promoted
increased levels of whole cell acetylated proteins, Hsp72, AcK382-p53, p-AMPK, pSer36H2B, p21, FOXO3A, 14-3-3, HO-1, NAMPT, SIRT1 and SIRT6 (Fig. 3c,d). Also, RSV
activated acetylation of Tip60 ex-vivo in a concentration-dependent manner (Extended Data
Fig. 5a). As expected from previous reports that acetylation of p53 is indispensible for its
activation17, a transient increase in acetylation of p53 (AcK382)1 was evident (Fig. 3c,d),
possibly through a transient inhibition of SIRT1 by the nicotinamide18 being produced.
Consistently, at 15 min, a RSV concentration-dependent reduction in total NAD+ with
concomitant production of nicotinamide and ADP-ribose was observed (Extended Data Fig.
5b,c). Thus, serum starvation and RSV rapidly increased all monitored proteins in a way that
is dependent on having active PARylation. This rapid increase is consistent with work
showing rapid upregulation of PARP-1 target genes19,20, possibly due to a broader effect of
PARP-1 on transcription and associated stress signaling13,21.

Author Manuscript

At longer times, and continuing at low concentrations (≤ 10 μM) of RSV, similarity between
responses to RSV and serum starvation was ostensibly seen. By 1h, low concentrations of
RSV elevated the NAD+ levels similar to those of serum-starvation conditions (Extended
Data Fig. 5d). Responses of key stress-signaling markers in a more extended period of 8–24
hours at 5 μM RSV were mostly similar to those of serum starvation (Extended Data Fig.
5e,f). At 5 μM RSV, levels of PARP-1PAR were sustained longer when compared with what
was observed at 1 μM RSV (compare 2, 8 h time points in Figure 3d with Extended Data
Fig. 5f) and we thus continued further studies at 5 μM RSV.

An si-RNA directed against PARP-1 (siRNAPARP-1) effectively abrogated the RSVstimulated expression of Hsp72, p-AMPK, SIRT1, FOXO3A, SESN2, NAMPT, PUMA and
SIRT6 (Fig. 4a). Also, 5 μM RSV promoted induction of BRAC1 and p14ARF (whose
genes are directly regulated by PARP-122,23). Consistently, the RSV-stimulated induction of
BRCA1 and p14ARF were prevented by siRNAPARP-1(Fig. 4a), further showing
involvement of PARP-1 in RSV-mediated induction of these proteins.
In figure 4a, RSV treatment led to enhanced activation of p53. However, in the absence of
RSV, knockdown of PARP-1 resulted in a background increase in the products of these p53regulated genes. Possibly p53 was activated by the knockdown of PARP-1, because removal
of PARP-1 would enhance background levels of DNA damage. Indeed, activation of p53, as
seen by enhanced acetylation and phosphorylation of p53, was observed (Fig. 4a).

Author Manuscript

siRNATyrRS-knockdown at 5 μM RSV eliminated induction of, and dramatically reduced
amounts of, PARylated PARP-1, of whole acetylated proteins, and of AcK382-p53, AcK16H4 (Tip60 activation), p-AMPK, and pSer36-H2B (AMPK activation) (Fig. 4b).
(Separately, RSV (5 μM) addition did not affect the viability of HeLa cells expressing either
siRNATyrRS or siRNAPARP-1 (Extended Data Fig. 6)). In contrast, siRNASIRT1-knockdown
did not affect RSV (5 μM)-mediated production of whole acetylated proteins or, among
other downstream markers, activation of PARP-1 and induction of SIRT6, FOXO3A,
NAMPT, AcK16-H4, p-AMPK24, and pSer36-H2B (Extended Data Fig. 7). Collectively,
figures 4a, b showed that ex-vivo TyrRS and PARP-1 collaborate to activate RSV- and
serum-starvation responses.

Author Manuscript

Although the RSV-TyrRS-PARP-1 axis initially consumes NAD+, at low RSV (5 μM),
NAD+ levels are transiently raised after 1 h due to NAMPT activation (Extended Data Fig.
5d). At 1 h at low RSV, induction of NAD+ levels was abolished with either siRNATyrRS or
siRNAPARP-1 (Extended Data Fig. 8). NAD+ depletion by NAMPT inhibition abolished
RSV-mediated induction of BRCA1, FOXO3A, NAMPT, SESN2 and SIRT6 (Fig. 4c).
These results are consistent with those using inhibitors against PLC-γ and the ryanodine
receptor25, which inhibit PARP-1 activation26 and ADP-ribose-mediated calcium
signaling25,27, and which prevented RSV-mediated AMPK activation. Similarly, a PARP-1
inhibitor prevented LKB1 activation by RSV28.

Mice were injected through tail vein-IV with 100 μl of 10 μM RSV and, after 30 min, were
sacrificed. Compared to the PBS IV-injected control, PARylated and acetylated proteins,
along with AcK16-H4 and pSer36-H2B, were significantly increased in skeletal muscle
(Extended Data Fig. 9a,b). Results in cardiac tissue were similar (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d).
In addition, PARP-1 activation diminished back to normal by 24 h (Extended Data Fig. 9e).
Consistent with ex-vivo assays, tissue samples from RSV-injected mice showed higher
levels of TyrRS-PARP-1 interaction together with increased auto-PARylation (Extended
Data Fig. 9f).
Tyr-SA (5 μM) was added to the IV-injection with RSV. No interaction of TyrRS with
PARP-1 could be detected in skeletal or cardiac muscle and levels of PARylated and
acetylated proteins did not increase. In contrast, co-injection of Gly-SA or cycloheximide

(CHX, protein synthesis inhibitor) did not block RSV/TyrRS-mediated activation of
PARP-1 and its downstream signals (Fig. 4d (muscle), Extended Data Fig. 9g,h (cardiac)).
Consistent with ex-vivo assays, immuno-precipitation of PARP-1 (from harvested muscle
tissue) pulled-down TyrRS, and immuno-precipitation of p53 showed its increased
acetylation. Pulldown of TyrRS and p53 acetylation were blocked in mice that had coinjections of Tyr-SA or the AG14361 (SelleckChem) PARP-1 inhibitor, but not of Gly-SA
or cycloheximide (Fig. 4e). These responses in vivo parallel ex-vivo assays, and support that
TyrRS is a major effector target for RSV that acts through PARP-1 as described in figure 3a.

Author Manuscript

The mechanism of action of RSV and of the stress response are both linked here to the
activation of PARP-1 through TyrRS and NAD+. The interaction of RSV with TyrRS could
be viewed as an example of xenohormesis through interactions of a natural ligand with a
protein target29. In this instance, the natural ligand blocks the active site to create a tRNA
synthetase catalytic null with a new, orthogonal function. This kind of catalytic null is in
contradistinction to those created by alternative splicing events that specifically remove the
active site7. The RSV-TyrRS activation of PARP-1 is readily observable in a functional in
vitro assay even at sub-micromolar concentrations (e.g., 10 – 20 nM, Fig. 2a middle). Thus,
TyrRS-RSV-induced PARP-1 activation appears at significantly lower RSV concentrations
than seen with RSV functional binding to other targets1,25,30. As a consequence, the direct
effects of RSV binding to these targets of RSV are layered over a pre-existing foundation
that comes from the TyrRS-RSV-PARP-1-NAD+ connection.

METHODS
Construction of the working model as illustrated in figure 3a

Because both RSV and serum starvation activate PARP-1 leading to the metabolic
breakdown of NAD+ into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose, downstream signaling markers
associated with the NAD+ metabolic flux were investigated. Targets were selected if they
were activated and/or inhibited under conditions of RSV-treatment, stress or NAD+
metabolic byproduct-treatment (nicotinamide and ADP-ribose). For example, nicotinamide
activates Tip6031 through SIRT1 inhibition18 and Tip60 activates ATM32, the p53 kinase.
p53 is a master regulator of NRF2 through p21 induction33 and inducible expression of
survival genes like SIRT634, SIRT135, Sestrins36, and FOXO3A37. (SIRT6 promotes DNA
repair under stress by activating PARP-138 and SIRT1 down-regulates the over-activation of
PARP-139). Similarly, ADP-ribose (metabolic byproduct of NAD+ and an inhibitor of
SIRT140) is a potent Ca2+ channel opener27,41 and a substrate for AMP production42 and
hence an indispensible component for AMPK activation by resveratrol43 and the stress
response by phosphorylating H2B44. AMPK is known to upregulate NAMPT expression45,
the major regulator of NAD+ levels in the cell46. NAD+ is major substrate for sirtuins
(deacetylation or mono-ADP-ribosylation38,47,48) and PARPs ((mono/poly)-ADPribosylation13,49). Although not depicted, p38 and NF-kB (major transducers of stress
signaling) are also regulated by TAK1 in a PARP-1/ATM dependent manner50,51.

Cell culture, transfection and resveratrol treatment

Author Manuscript

Author Manuscript

HeLa cells (from ATCC, mycoplasma free) were cultured in a humidified incubator with 5%
CO2 in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Invitrogen) and 1x penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were transfected with pcDNA6TyrRS-V5 (wild type), or pcDNA3.1-ZZ-PARP-1 using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen).
Resveratrol (SantaCruz Biotechnologies), at a series of concentrations from 0 to 50 μM were
used to treat HeLa cells 0–24 h in experiments described. As the effects of RSV are strongly
influenced by the background level of PARP-1 activity, the experiments were done only
after checking to verify that background PARP-1 activation was low. Our criterion was to
see PARP-1 activation upon serum starvation, along with Hsp72 induction52. When serum
starvation induces PARP-1 activation with Hsp72 induction within 30–45 min (from the
same batch of a split of HeLa cells), we consistently see PARP-1 activation at lower
concentrations of RSV (1μM). Cell culture medium was supplemented with Tyr-SA or GlySA (RNA-TEC, Coralville, IA) where mentioned. Silencer® Select Pre-designed siRNA
against PARP-1 (siRNA ID#: s1099, 5′-GCAGCUUCAUAACCGAAGAtt-3′), SIRT1
(siRNA ID#: s23770, 5′-GGCUUGAUGGUAAUCAGUAtt-3′) and TyrRS (siRNA ID#:
s443, 5′-GGACUUUGCUGCUGAGGUUtt-3′) were purchased from Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA and was transfected into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen).
NAMPT, the rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD+ salvage pathway, was inhibited using
STF-11880453 according to manufactures’ protocol (SelleckChem). The effect of a
concomitant increase in nicotinamide production with a reduction of NAD+ concentration
(leading to SIRT1 inhibition) was monitored by immunoblotting with α-AcK382-p53, an
acetylation site known to be specifically targeted by SIRT11. α-pSer15-p53 monitoring
indicated if enhanced acetylation preceded the phosphorylation event54. Total p53 was
blotted with α-p53. Transactivation of p53 was determined by monitoring its known targets,
such as p21, PUMA, 14-3-3, FOXO3A, SESN2 and SIRT6. Activation of NRF2 was further
confirmed by following HO-1 expression, using the cognate antibodies. Activation of
AMPK (Thr172-phosphorylation) mediated through AMP and Ca2+ influx25 was monitored
using α-pThr172-AMPK. Activation of AMPK on its targets was further determined by both
α-pSer36-H2B and by the expression level of NAMPT.

10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1x penicillin/streptomycin.
Preparation of cell fractions

Author Manuscript

Protocol for cell fractionation was followed as described previously12. Briefly, for whole
cell lysate preparation, HeLa cells were dissolved in 1xSDS-PAGE loading buffer
containing 300 mM NaCl. For cytoplasmic fraction preparation, HeLa cells were suspended
in 0.1 ml of swelling buffer for 6 min on ice, and then incubated with 0.1 ml of plasma
membrane lysis buffer for 5 min on ice. The cells were immediately passed through a 21-G
needle 10 times and centrifuged for 10 min at 3220g, 4°C. The supernatant was harvested,
while the pellets were used for the preparation of nuclear fractions. For this purpose, the
pellet (nuclei) was incubated for 30 min at 4°C with 0.2 ml nuclear extraction buffer.
Whenever required, PARP-1 (AG14361) and PARG inhibitors (ADP-HPD, Millipore) were
added to the cell lysis buffer to ensure unwanted PARylation and removal of PAR chains
with PARG.
Immuno-precipitation and Ni-NTA pull-down assays

Author Manuscript

Protocol for immuno-precipitation was followed as described previously12. Briefly, the
supernatants were pre-cleared by incubation with protein G beads. The pre-cleared cell
lysates were incubated at 4°C for 1 h with either α-PARP-1, α-ATM, α-DNA-PKcs, αTyrRS, α-Tip60 or non-immune IgG, at a concentration of 5 μg/ml followed by incubation
with 30 μl Protein G-beads (pretreated with 10 mg/ml BSA) at 4°C for 1h with rotation.
PARP-1 (AG14361) and PARG inhibitors (ADP-HPD, Millipore) were added to the cell
lysis buffer to ensure unwanted PARylation and removal of PAR chains with PARG.
Immuno-precipitates were washed three times, subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted
with specific antibodies. Whenever mentioned, the ZZ domain allowed immunoprecipitation of ectopically expressed ZZ-PARP-1, using anti-IgG. Whenever Ni-NTA pulldown was performed, proteins with a 6X-His tag were overexpressed in E. coli. Cells were
lysed and the supernatant fractions containing the soluble proteins were mixed with HeLa
cell lysates. For Ni-NTA pull-downs, normal procedures for immunoprecipitation were
followed with 15–20 mM imidazole in the washing buffer.
Animal experiments

Author Manuscript

All experiments were approved by the Scripps Research Institute, IACUC (protocol number
13-0002) and conducted by the mice facility at The Scripps Research Institute. BALB/cByJ
mice were originally purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Six week old male mice were
kept with a 12 h light-dark cycle with free access to food and water for 3 days before
conducting the experiment. For all studies, mice were dosed once and collected sample after
either at 30 min or at 24 h. Briefly, activation of PARP-1 in mouse tissues treated with
resveratrol was performed by the intravenous (IV) injection of a 100 μl sample of resveratrol
(10 μM) in PBS into 8 mouse tails (0.012 mg/kg). A 100 μl PBS injection was used as a
control in 6 mice. Tissue samples were collected from 4 resveratrol treated mice and 3
control mice after 30 min treatment. Tissue samples from the remaining mice were collected
after 24h. In a different experiment, blocking of resveratrol mediated activation of PARP-1

by Tyr-SA was analyzed with 5 groups of two mice each, a 100 μl sample of resveratrol (10
μM ) in PBS alone and, separately, with Tyr-SA (5 μM), Gly-SA (5 μM), cycloheximide (5
μM) or the AG14361 PARP-1 inhibitor (10 μM) was IV-injected. A 100 μl PBS injection
with Tyr-SA was used in a control group (2 mice) as indicated. Tissue samples were
collected after 30 min treatment. Muscle or heart tissues samples were homogenized and
analyzed by immunoblotting for the status of poly-ADP-ribosylation and associated
signaling events.
Recombinant protein purification

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Human TyrRS and PARP-1 and their variants were purified as previously described10,12.
Briefly, DNA encoding either full-length TyrRS (aa 1-528), mini-TyrRS (aa 1-341), dNTyrRS (aa 237-528), CT-TyrRS (aa 324-528), was cloned into Nde-I/Hind-III sites of
pET-20b vector (Novagen, Gibstown, NJ). The expressed proteins include a 6-His tag from
the vector sequence. The full-length PARP-1 and its variants (N-terminal domain (NTD) and
C-terminal domain (CTD)) were cloned into pET 20b vector. All proteins having a Cterminal His-tag were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) by induction for 4h with 1 mM
isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Proteins were purified from the supernatants of lysed
cells using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) column chromatography according
to the manufacturer’s instruction. We also included an additional high salt 2-column wash
(1-1.5 M NaCl), to remove the endogenous DNA/RNA associated with the purified protein.
The NaCl concentration was increased to 1.5M in increments and returned to final elution
buffer having 250 mM NaCl in decrements. All the proteins were subjected to a gelfiltration (S-200) chromatography and collected the protein peak corresponding to
homogenous protein. As endotoxin associated with purified protein interfered with the
inhibitory/activating effect of RSV on TyrRS/PARP-1, the complete protein purification
included an additional endotoxin removal step. The purified protein was further passed
through a column containing Detoxi-Gel™ (Pierce-Thermo Scientific, IL, USA) and
followed the manufactures instructions. The final endotoxin level (0.5 EU/mg/ml) was
measured using The EndosafeR-PTS kit (Charles River Laboratories, Charleston, SC). The
quality of each protein purification was validated by SDS-PAGE analysis.
Protein crystallization and data collection

Author Manuscript

All the steps were followed as mentioned in the previously report for mini-TyrRS
crystallization10. Briefly, mini-TyrRS was mixed with either 1 mM RSV or 2 mM Tyrosine
and incubated at 4°C for 16h. Before setting up the crystallization trials, the protein samples
were subjected to high-speed centrifugation (13000 rpm for 15 min) to remove all the
precipitants and transferred the clear soluble fraction to a new tube. The crystallization trials
were done using 2.1 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M NaH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 6–8), and 2% acetone at
room temperature. Although, mini-TyrRS crystals with L-tyrosine were grown in 3 days
(data collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource), crystals with RSV were
grown only after 3–4 months at around pH 7. X-ray data were collected at 2.1A° using the
in-house x-ray diffraction facility (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla). Data were
integrated and scaled using HKL2000. The electron density was refined by molecular
replacement (CNS and CCP4/REFMAC suite and Coot) using the known structure of mini-

ATP-PPi exchange assay

Tyrosyl adenylate synthesis was measured by using the tyrosine-dependent ATPpyrophosphate (PPi) exchange assay. A mixture containing 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 20 mM
KCl, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM NaPPi, 2 mM DTT, 250–500 μM L-tyrosine, 10 mM MgCl2, and
0.01 mCi/ml Na[32P]PPi was added to 50–100 nM purified TyrRS (endotoxin free,
0.5EU/mg/ml), pre-incubated with 0–1mM RSV at 4°C for 30 min. The ATP-PPi exchange
reaction was incubated at room temperature, and aliquots were removed at specified time
intervals and quenched in a mixture containing 40 mM NaPPi, 1.4% HClO4, 0.4% HCl, and
8% (wt/vol) of activated charcoal. After thoroughly mixing, the charcoal was filtered and
washed with a solution of 7% HClO4 and 200 mM NaPPi using Spin-X Centrifuge Filters
(Corning, Corning, NY) containing 0.45-μm pore-size cellulose acetate filters. After drying,
the charcoal was punched into scintillation vials and the radioactivity of the ATP bound to
the charcoal mixture was measured by scintillation counting.

Protocol followed as described previously12. Briefly, 5 μl recombinant PARP-1 (2μg ) was
mixed with 5 μl recombinant TyrRS (0–50 μM) and depending on the experiment either
RSV, TyrSA, DNA or AG14361 were also added (5 μl) and adjusted the volume to 25 μl.
This mixture was incubated at 4°C for 15 min, then incubated with 25 μl 2x PAR assay
cocktail (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM
EDTA, 40 nM NAD and 1 μCi [32P]-NAD (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA)) at 30°C for 30
min. [RSV] used in figure 2a middle is 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60 and 80 nM and in figure 2a
bottom is 40 nM. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50μl 2x SDS sample buffer (5%
SDS,) and heated at 95°C for 1 min. The [32P]-PARylated PARP-1 was separated from free
[32P]-NAD on SDS-PAGE, vacuum-dried and the poly-ADP-ribosylation activity of
PARP-1 was analyzed using visualized by a phosphorimager (Typhoon™ FLA 7000, GE

a, Both heat shock (42°C for 30 min) and tunicamycin-treatment (10 μg/ml, ER stress)
facilitated the nuclear translocation of TyrRS and activation of PARP-1. b, Resveratrol or
serum starvation facilitate TyrRS interaction with PARP-1 and Tyr-SA prevents this
interaction. ZZ-PARP-1 was immunoprecipiated with IgG from HeLa cells treated with
RSV or serum starvation alone or in combination with Tyr-SA. c, Resveratrol or serum
starvation mediated PARP-1 activation is blocked only by Tyr-SA and not by Gly-SA. d,
TyrRS interacts directly with PARP-1. HeLa cell lysate after RSV treatment (5 μM, 30 min)
was divided into three parts and treated with PARG and catalytically inactive PARG-MT.
PARP-1 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed for TyrRS interaction. e. Model illustrating

Figure 4. Resveratrol treatment activates TyrRS-PARP-1 driven signaling events in mouse
tissues

Author Manuscript

a, siRNA of PARP-1 or (b) siRNA of TyrRS abrogates resveratrol-mediated downstream
signaling events. HeLa cells were treated with siRNAPARP-1 or siRNATyrRS for 60 h to
knockdown PARP-1 or TyrRS expression levels by ~70–80%. Knockdown efficiency was
monitored by with α-PARP-1 or α-TyrRS. For, siRNATyrRS HeLa cells were treated with
either serum starvation or resveratrol (5, 10 25 and 50 μM) for 45 minutes. The dashed line
in figure 4a represents the demarcation between siRNACon and siRNAPARP-1; all the
samples were run on the same gel. c, NAMPT inhibition abrogates resveratrol-mediated
downstream signaling events. HeLa cells were pre-treated with STF-118804 (100 nM), a
NAMPT inhibitor, for 16 h and then treated with resveratrol (5 μM), with samples collected
at intervals as indicated. Various signaling events, as depicted, were monitored using
appropriate antibodies. Acetylation status was monitored using α-acetyl-lysine. The dashed
line separates results without and with the inhibitor. d, Resveratrol mediated activation of
PARP-1 is blocked by Tyr-SA. Activation of Tip60 and AMPK were monitored by using αAcK16-H4 and α-pSer36-H2B, respectively. e, Resveratrol-mediated interaction of TyrRS
with PARP-1 and acetylation of p53 are blocked by Tyr-SA. Immunoprecipitation of
PARP-1 and p53 from muscle tissue demonstrated RSV-mediated TyrRS-PARP-1
interaction and p53 acetylation.
