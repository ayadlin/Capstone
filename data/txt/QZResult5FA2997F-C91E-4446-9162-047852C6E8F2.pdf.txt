Abstract
Current cancer management aims to integrate molecular signatures into the design of personalized therapies.
Recent advances in "omics'' done on tumor specimens have led to the identification of factors that either
recognize cancers of dismal prognosis or pinpoint "druggable'' signaling pathways, which can be interrupted by
targeted therapies. However, accumulating evidence underscores the biological and clinical significance of
immune predictors in several compartments (blood, serum, tumor) in a variety of malignancies. An additional
aspect that has been overlooked is the bidirectional, tumor-host interaction during therapeutic intervention,
suggesting that dynamic molecular, biochemical, and metabolic signatures should be developed in the future.
We review immune parameters of prognostic or predictive value during cancer therapy, and highlight existing
"descriptive-prognostic'' and "functional-therapeutic'' molecular signatures, with the hindsight of designing
appropriate compensatory therapies. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9538–43. 2010 AACR.

The host immune response can have an impact on cancer
incidence, cancer growth, prognosis, and response to therapy.
The development and progression of cancer may be counteracted by innate immune effectors [such as dendritic cells (DC)
or natural killer (NK) cells] and cognate immune responses
(mediated by antibodies or tumor-specific CD4þ and CD8þ T
lymphocytes) in three phases: elimination, equilibrium, and
evasion (1–3). During the oncogenic process, dedifferentiation
can induce (a) overexpression of tumor-associated antigens or
neomutations that elicit specific T-cell responses, (b) exposure
of stress-induced danger signals (such as ligands of the NK
receptor NKG2D) that elicit anticancer immunosurveillance
through critical receptors expressed by immune effectors,
and/or (3) tumor cell death and/or senescence pathways that
are associated with the production of chemokines and consequent attraction leukocytes. In specific cases, chemotherapeutic agents restore the immunologic equilibrium or even
the elimination phase of tumors that have escaped from
immunosurveillance, either by "debulking'' tumor burdens

Immune Predictors Negatively Influencing
Clinical Outcome in Cancer
Lymphopenia is clearly associated with poor survival in
various malignancies (Supplementary Table S1). Moreover,
expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells has a negative impact on
overall survival in clear-cell renal cell, breast, esophageal,
pancreatic, non–small cell lung (NSCLC), and hepatocellular
(HCC) carcinomas (Supplementary Table S1). PD-L1 expression was inversely correlated with the number of tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), specifically CD8þ T cells, and
positively associated with infiltration by Foxp3þTregs. Blocking PD-L1 together with gemcitabine could restore T-cell
infiltrates and promote tumor regression in preclinical models
of pancreatic cancer (5). By reducing the surface expression of
human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I molecules, tumor cells
can evade immunosurveillance by cytotoxic T cells (which
recognize tumor antigens presented by HLA class I), yet
become ultimately recognizable by NK cells (which recognize
the absence of HLA class I). Therefore, changes in the expression of HLA class I molecules have a major impact on patient
prognosis (Supplementary Table S1). Defects in HLA class I
expression are caused by multiple mechanisms including loss
of heterozygosity at chromosome 6p, b2 microglobulin, HLAclass I mutations, or defective expression of components of
the antigen-processing machinery (6, 7). By regulating HLA
class II and cochaperone expression, interferon-g (IFN-g),
whose expression is often linked with TIL infiltrates, plays
a prognostic role, as shown in several cancers. Thus, patients

with breast cancers with a particular HLA expression pattern
(DRþIiþDM) have markedly decreased recurrence-free and
disease-specific survival as compared with DRþIiþDMþ
tumors [which contain increased levels of IFN-g, interleukin
(IL)-2, and IL-12 mRNA]. HLA-DRþ/cochaperone expression is
associated with high CD3þ, CD4þ, and CD8þ T-cell infiltrates
(but not B cells) and constitutes an independent predictor of
survival in breast cancer (8), whereas IFN-g expression is an
independent prognostic factor in ovarian cancers (9). Total
loss of HLA class I by breast cancer cells independently
predicted improved patient survival (10), suggesting a potential role of NK cells in the control of breast cancer (11).

Immune Predictors Positively Influencing
Clinical Outcome in Cancer
Although controversial for decades, the notion that the
quality and contexture of immune infiltrates invading tumors
can influence prognosis has become increasingly accepted, as
reviewed in (12) and summarized in Supplementary Table S2.
Infiltration by cytotoxic memory effector cells (positive for
CD3, CD8, granzyme B, and CD45RO) around and within the
cancerous lesions predicted lower recurrence risk in colorectal cancer (CRC; ref. 13). Although many CRC tumors
express IFN-gR, some (72 out of 402) with good prognosis
exhibit a nuclear localization of STAT1, correlating with TIL
infiltration. Expression of MICA, a ligand for NKG2D, TIL
infiltration, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class I expression, also constitutes independent positive prognostic markers in CRC (14–17). Together, these examples
illustrate the potential utility of immune parameters as prognostic biomarkers.

Large-scale Screening for the Identification
of Immune Biomarkers
Numerous systematic studies relying on the use of mRNA
expression arrays and systematic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses have led to the identification of
immune parameters that can influence the prognosis of
cancer patients.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
The number of karyotypic abnormalities correlates with
dismal prognosis in follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (FNHL).
However, gene expression signatures of nonmalignant tumorinfiltrating immune cells (including T cells, macrophages, and
DCs) appeared as the strongest predictors of survival in FNHL
(18–20). Good prognosis of FNHL was associated with the
expression of genes encoding T-cell–relevant proteins (such as
CD7 and CD8b1, but not CD4 or CD2), whereas bad prognosis
was marked by the expression of genes specific for myeloid cells
(19). Confirming the immune control of FNHL, gene polymorphisms (14 SNPs) in cytokine genes and related immune
regulation genes can influence the fate of FNHL patients.
Cerhan and colleagues (21) identified SNPs in four genes
(IL-8, IL-2, IL-12B, and IL1RN coding for the IL-1R antagonist)
that influenced patient survival individually, but even more so
when combined into a common carrier model that summed

www.aacrjournals.org

the number of deleterious genotypes. Combining the SNPs with
clinical and demographic factors increased the predictive
ability of the model (21). Similarly, evaluation of the multiSNP risk score in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL) led to
the identification of an IL-10 haplotype as well as four SNP
genotypes [in IL-1A, IL-8RB, IL-4R, and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)] that were deleterious for patient survival in univariate
and multivariate analyses. Patients with four deleterious genotypes were six times more likely to die compared with patients
with zero deleterious genotypes (22).
Hepatocarcinoma
A 17-gene signature of noncancerous hepatic tissues predicted both survival and local recurrence of HCC, and was
superior to other clinical variables in the multivariate Cox
regression model (23). The metastases-inclined microenvironment (MIM) expression profile, which was associated with a
7.9-increased risk of recurrence (either by venous metastasis or
local recurrence), was associated with a Th2 cytokine switch
(elevated IL-4, 5, 8, 10) and increased expression of MHC class
I–related genes as well as platelet proteoglycan (PRG1) and
annexin A1 (ANXA1), correlating with elevated hepatocyte and
serum CSF1 (23). Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the
metastases-averse microenvironment (MAM), which is antinomic to MIM, was associated with reduced infiltration by
HLA-DRþ and CD68þ cells [antigen-presenting cell (APC)
other than Kuppfer cells], induction of inflammatory cytokines
(such as IFN-g and TNF-a), elevated expression of the inflammatory marker NOS2 by noncancerous hepatocytes, and an
increased proportion of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells (23). Other
studies have corroborated that molecular signatures of noncancerous liver tissues predict late recurrence of HCC (24, 25).
An innate inflammatory signature (composed of TNF-a, IL-6,
and CCL2) was found to correlate with patient survival in 61
HCC patients, TNF being an independent predictor of survival
in multivariate analyses. NK (characterized by the expression
of the NCR3 gene and by CD3CD56þ infiltrates in immunohistochemistry) and CD8þ T-cell infiltrates correlated with
tumor apoptosis and were the main proliferating lymphocytes
in tumors of favorable prognosis (24, 25).
Colorectal cancers
Galon and colleagues (13) showed, for CRC, that good
prognosis was associated with CD3z, CD8, granulysin, granzyme B, as well as the expression of T helper 1 (Th1)–
associated genes such as T-box transcription factor 21, interferon regulatory factor 1, and IFN-g. Applying the same
immune signature to small retrospective cohorts of patients
with different kinds of cancer, Hsu and colleagues (26) found
that the Th1 adaptive immunity-related pattern was associated with good prognosis in prostate cancers, in early
diagnosed breast cancers, but not in NSCLC. Surprisingly,
inflammation- and immunosuppression-related clusters were
associated with favorable clinical outcome in lymphoma
patients. In glioblastoma multiforme, the inflammationrelated genes dictated a more favorable prognosis (26). Unfortunately, in this study (26), none of these signatures was
analyzed using the multivariate Cox regression model.

Stage IV cutaneous melanoma
An unsupervised hierarchical clustering of global gene
expression data from 57 stage IV melanomas led to the
identification of four subgroups of patients with distinct
prognosis: the high immune responses (HIR), proliferative,
pigmentation, and normal-like subgroups (27). As compared
with the other subgroups, HIR was associated with overexpression of LCK, IFNGR1, HLA class I and II, CXCL12,
and IL1R1, as well as a brisk infiltration of CD3þ T lymphocytes, determined by immunohistochemistry, hypermethylation of the p16INK4A gene, and gains in CGH arrays. The HIR
subgroup also exhibited prolonged overall survival under
dacarbazine therapy (DTIC; ref. 27). This subgroup classification has been validated, to some extent, on publicly available
melanoma microarray databases (such as the GO:0002429
database), confirming the idea that tumors associated with
a low expression of immune-relevant genes have a dismal
prognosis (27). These data corroborate previous correlations
between favorable prognosis and infiltration by mature DCs
and activated T cells in primary cutaneous melanoma (28, 29).
Breast cancer
The prognostic impact of lymphocyte infiltration (LI) in
breast cancer is being debated (Supplementary Table S2).
Microarray analyses done on whole-tumor specimens suggested several immunologically relevant genes (such as genes
encoding interferons or markers relevant to B- or T-lymphocyte functions). However, gene expression analyses done on
breast cancer cell lines of the basal cell subtype can express
such immune response–related genes (30, 31), shedding
doubts on the possibility that these profiles, indeed, reflect
an immune response. However, laser-captured microdissection of stromal components led to the identification of a
signature associated with Th1 immune responses that predicted favorable clinical outcome (32).
Numerous prognostic molecular signatures have been
reported to predict the clinical outcome of breast cancer
(33). In particular, these signatures identify a subgroup of
favorable prognosis, that is, the low-proliferating estrogen
receptor (ER)þ tumors (34), whereas the signatures tend to
assign a bad prognosis to all of the ER tumors and the
highly proliferating ERþ tumors. Importantly, the LCK metagene, which is thought to reflect the abundance of T cells,
may separate the ER group into two subgroups with
opposite clinical outcome (35). Rody and colleagues (35)
identified several clusters of immune response–related
metagenes by large-scale microarray analysis and found that
the level of expression of the LCK metagene (T cells) and the
IgG metagene (B cells) correlated among each other, suggesting a parallel recruitment or intratumor proliferation of
B and T lymphocytes. High expression of the LCK metagene
predicted improved disease-free survival of patients with
ER, as well as in HER2-overexpressing ERþ, cancers and
outperformed all standard parameters in multivariate analysis (35). This finding contrasts with another report, in
which the IgG metagene outperformed the LCK metagene
as a favorable prognostic factor in highly proliferating specimens, as determined on a series of 200 lymph node–negative

breast cancers treated by surgical resection only (36).
Another study identified an immune response–related signature that correlated with TIL (verified by hematoxylin and
eosin staining) and predicted favorable clinical outcome
among HER2-overexpressing breast cancers (37). Teschendorff and colleagues (38) analyzed three microarray data sets
and identified a cluster of ER breast cancers displaying a
high expression of six immune response–related genes that
was associated with improved prognosis (38). On the basis of
a previously published 368-gene expression signature, Sabatier and colleagues (39) reported that immune response–
related genes are predictors identifying a subgroup of basal
cell carcinomas [breast cancers (mostly ER)] with favorable
prognosis (39). Accordingly, a meta-analysis of breast cancer–related molecular signatures strongly indicated that
including immune modules ameliorated the prognostic performance of microarray signatures (40).
Together, the inclusion of immune response–related genes
into microarray analyses may refine the prognostic stratification of ER or HER2-overexpressing ERþ tumors that were
traditionally considered as a homogeneous group with bad
prognosis. It should be noted that this may hold true for other
tumor types as well. Thus, a 23-prognostic gene classifier
(encoding 21 genes related to cellular proliferation plus two
immune response–related genes including IFN-gR1) has been
validated for its prognostic impact in 17 out of 20 independent
tumor cohorts across several solid tumor types of various
grades (41).

Integrating the Host-Tumor Interaction
in Predictive Models
Recent investigations have aimed at analyzing the predictive value of immune parameters including TIL, the ratio
between regulatory versus effector T lymphocytes, Th1
profiles, functional T- or NK-cell assays, loss of function
SNPs, microarray-based gene profiling, or serum autoantibody responses (Supplementary Table S3). How may the
immune system influence the therapeutic response? One
response to this question may reside in how tumor cells die
in response to cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. Preclinical
studies indicate that, when cancer cells succumb to an
immunogenic cell death modality, they may elicit a therapeutic anticancer immune response, which then contributes to the eradication of residual tumor cells (42).
Conversely, when cancer cells succumb to a nonimmunogenic death modality, they fail to elicit such a protective
immune response (4, 43, 44). One form of immunogenic cell
death is characterized by the early cell surface exposure of
chaperones including calreticulin (CRT) and/or heat shock
proteins, which determine the uptake of tumor antigens
and/or affect DC maturation. The later release of the protein
high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which acts on Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4) on the surface of DCs, is required for
optimal presentation of antigens from dying tumor cells.
Moreover, ATP secreted from dying tumor cells stimulates
purinergic P2RX7 receptors on the surface of DCs to stimulate the production of essential cytokines. Hence, CRT,

Molecular Pathways Triggered by Chemotherapy

Extension of the key-lock concept to other tumor
subtypes
A variety of different agents including anthracyclines,
oxaliplatin, ionizing irradiation (45), and vinblastine elicit
immunogenic cell death (49). We analyzed whether the lossof-function SNP in the tlr4 gene (rs4986790) would predict
time to progression in oxaliplatin-treated colon cancers. In
the FFCD 2000 to 2005 randomized trial, 334 patients with
metastatic colon cancer were treated with 5-fluorouracil and
folinic acid (FuFol) until failure, followed by combination of
FuFol þ oxaliplatin versus FuFol alone. In this cohort,
patients with at least one tlr4 loss-of-function allele
(16.5%) did not differ from those carrying two normal tlr
alleles with respect to age, sex, number of disease sites, the
World Health Organization classification, alkaline phosphatase serum levels, or other laboratory parameters. However,
CRC patients bearing the tlr4 Asp299Gly polymorphism had

Conclusions
To provide accurate and standardized treatment recommendations, clinicians will be guided in the future by
increasingly sophisticated logarithms that integrate clinical,
histopathologic, and molecular parameters (Fig. 1). So far,
algorithms or nomograms aimed at predicting therapeutic
responses have integrated mostly tumor cell–intrinsic parameters, yet have neglected stromal or immune parameters.
We believe that the host-tumor equilibrium is modified
during the course of successful chemotherapies according
to the "key-lock paradigm,'' and that the stigmata of this
paradigm should be considered as candidate biomarkers to
detect "nonresponders,'' which would be candidates for
compensatory immune stimulation. Prospective studies
examining the added value of such new immune predictors
for the clinical outcome, as well as randomized trials aimed
at compensating immunologic defects, will confirm or invalidate these predictions.

Pre-therapy

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in TLR4 and P2RX7
as predictors in breast cancer therapy
As shown in preclinical models, the dialogue between
dying cells and immune effectors (according to the "keylock paradigm'') involves two receptors present on DCs,
namely TLR4 and P2RX7, which recognize two soluble
molecules released from the dying tumor cells, HMGB1
and ATP, respectively. In the absence of TLR4 or P2RX7,
the immune system fails to mount an antitumor immune
response after chemotherapy, and tumors implanted in
TLR4/ or P2RX7/ mice fail to respond to anticancer
therapy in conditions in which tumors growing on wild-type
mice can be controlled by chemotherapy (46, 47). Similarly, a
loss-of-function SNP in tlr4 (rs4986790) has been associated
with poor prognosis in breast cancer treated with anthracyclines (46). We investigated the prognostic value of a lossof-function SNP, p2rx7 (rs3751143), that reduces the affinity
of P2RX7 to ATP and reduces the ATP-dependent IL-1b
release from monocytes (48). We analyzed 225 sporadic
breast cancer patients, all with the normal TLR4 allele,
which were stratified according to their P2  7 genotype
[normal (64%) versus variant (36%) P2  7]. Although no
significant differences in classical prognostic factors
between normal and variant groups of patients were found,
the P2  7 loss-of-function allele had a significant negative
prognostic impact on metastatic disease-free survival (Log
rank test; P ¼ 0.02). A multivariate Cox regression model
confirmed a significant effect for tumor grade and for P2  7
genotype (47). Together, these data suggest that selective
immune defects can compromise the response to anticancer
radiotherapy and chemotherapy, at least in Nþ breast cancer
treated with adjuvant anthracyclines.

a shorter time to progression than patients with normal tlr4
alleles. In stark contrast, the tlr4 genotype had no influence
on progression-free or disease-free survival of a cohort of
stage II CRC patients (n ¼ 258) who were treated by surgical
removal of the primary tumor without any adjuvant chemotherapy. This result suggests that tlr4Asp299Gly is not a
prognostic but rather a predictive factor of the response to
oxaliplatin (50).
Together, these results provide a preliminary validation of
the concept that immune parameters can influence the efficacy of anticancer chemotherapies (51–54). It will be important to investigate the possibility to predict therapeutic
outcome by assessing dynamic variables such as changes in
the frequency, composition, activation status and repertoire of
TIL, the expression of immune-relevant metagenes (in
repeated lymph node biopsies), or the generation of tumorspecific antibodies (in patient sera) after chemotherapy.

HMGB1, and ATP compose some of the "dents'' of the "key''
that unlocks the immune response (4, 45). On the basis of
these premises, it can be speculated that anticancer therapies can modify the host-tumor interaction, which, in turn,
may affect the therapeutic success. Optimal molecular predictors should hence integrate factors that affect the hosttumor dialogue during the cytotoxic insult.
