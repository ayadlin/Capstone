Abstract
The Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) evolved to cope with pathogens, but it is expressed in a variety of tumors for
reasons that are unclear. In this study, we report that neuroblastoma (NB) cells express functional TLR9.
Liposome-complexed CpG oligonucleotides inhibited the proliferation of TLR9-expressing NB cells and
induced caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death. Inhibitory oligonucleotides (iODNs) abrogated these
effects. RNA interference reduced TLR9 expression but not to the level where functional responses to
CpG were abolished. Compared with free CpG, liposomal formulations of NB-targeted CpG (TL-CpG)
significantly prolonged the survival of mice bearing NB tumor xenografts. While CpG alone lacked antitumor
efficacy in NOD/SCID/IL2rg/ mice, TL-CpG retained significant efficacy related to direct effects on tumor
cells. TLR9 expression in primary human NB specimens was found to correlate inversely with disease stage.
Our findings establish functional expression of TLR9 in NB and suggest that TLR9 may represent a novel
theranostic target in this disease. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9816–26. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a family of highly
conserved pattern recognition receptors, evolved by the
immune system to recognize extracellular pathogen-associated motifs known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (1). These are expressed predominantly by dendritic
cells, macrophages, NK, and B cells. Recently, it has been
reported that epithelial and endothelial cells (2, 3) as well
various tumors, such as melanoma, colon, breast, prostate,
and lung cancer (4, 5), can express TLRs. Although understanding of the functional impact of TLRs expression on
tumor cells warrants further investigation, current evidence
indicates that TLRs on cancer cells can either promote or
inhibit tumor progression (4).
TLR9 recognizes unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, very
common in bacterial DNA but not in vertebrate genome in
which CpG are often methylated (6). Differently from most TLR

members, expressed at the cell surface, TLR9 has cytoplasmic
localization and resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of
resting cells (6, 7). It has been shown that CpG DNA binds
directly to TLR9. After internalization of CpG DNA into a
subcellular lysosomal compartment, TLR9 translocates from
ER to this CpG DNA–containing lysosomal compartment
where TLR9/CpG DNA binding occurs and signal transduction
is initiated (7). Synthetic CpG oligonucleotides (CpG ODNs)
can be generated with specific CpG sequence motifs, as well as
with backbone modifications. So far, 3 different classes of CpG
ODN have been synthesized, differing each other in their ability
to stimulate and activate different immune cell populations (8).
Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid
tumor of childhood; despite aggressive treatment approaches,
the outcome for high-risk, NB-affected patients remains poor
(9, 10). Thus, the identification of new molecular candidates to
be developed as novel therapeutic targets represents a priority
area of research.
We previously reported that the administration of liposomes targeted to NB cells via disialoganglioside GD2 and
encapsulating CpG-containing c-myb–specific antisense
ODNs led to long-term survival of NB-bearing mice (11, 12).
On the basis of previous studies on the expression of TLRs on
tumor cells of different lineages, including melanoma that shares
the neuroectodermal origin with NB, we hypothesized that NB
cells could express TLR9 and, consequently, respond to treatment with CpG DNA. Herein, we investigated the expression of
TLR9 on a wide panel of NB cell lines and primary NB specimens
and also assessed its functionality and mechanism of action.
This study shows for the first time, to our knowledge, the
functional expression of TLR9 in NB and suggests that TLR9
may represent a novel prognostic and/or therapeutic target.

Expression and Functionality of TLR9 in Neuroblastoma

Materials and Methods
Liposomes preparation
Anti-GD2–targeted CpG-entrapping liposomal formulation
was prepared using the method already described by us for the
tumor selective delivery of antisense ODNs (11, 13–15).
Cell lines and culture conditions
The human NB cell lines IMR-32, SH-SY5Y, SK-NSH, SKNMC, SK-NAS, SK-NF-I, SK-NBE(2), and SK-NBE(2c) and the
malignant B-cell line Raji were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); the HTLA-230 cell
line was a gift of Dr. E. Bogenmann (16) (Los Angeles Children's Hospital, CA); the other human NB cell lines GI-LI-N,
GI-ME-N, ACN, LAN-1, LAN-5, and IMR-5 were obtained from
the Biological Bank and Cell Factory (National Cancer Institute, Genoa, Italy). All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma
contamination and characterized by cell proliferation, morphology evaluation, and multiplex short tandem repeat profiling test, both after thawing and within 8 passages in culture
and used in this time frame.
Cells were grown in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified
Eagle medium; Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gibco-Invitrogen S.r.l., Carlsbad, CA) and 50 IU/mL of
sodium penicillin G, 50 mg/mL of streptomycin sulfate, and
2 mmol/L of L-glutamine (all reagents from Sigma), as already
described (17).
RNA isolation and gene expression analysis
The isolation of total RNA from cell lines was performed by
chemical extraction in combination with a silica-based membrane immobilization, using QIAzol and RNeasy mini and
micro kit (Qiagen, S.p.A., Milan, Italy). The mRNA expression
levels of TLR9 target genes and the GAPDH-positive control
were analyzed by a 2-step real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
using a random priming-based reverse-transcription (High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit; Applied Biosystems,
Austin, TX) and SYBR Green I binding dye (Platinum
SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG; Invitrogen S.r.l.), and data
were normalized as previously reported (18).
The comparative Ct method was used for relative quantification of gene expression in wild-type and transfected cell lines.
Analysis of the data was performed by qGene software (Biotechniques; ref. 19). (For details, see Supplementary Material.)
Cell proliferation assay
NB cells were plated, in quadruplicate for each treatment, in
96-well plates in complete medium, cultured for 24 hours, and
then treated with CpG at a concentration of 4 mg/mL. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were treated
immediately after isolation. CpG were administered to the
cells either free or complexed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (0.3 mL/well; Invitrogen S.r.l.) for additional 24 hours.
Lipofectamine and CpG were complexed according to manufacturer's instruction. Hereafter, complexes formed by CpG
and Lipofectamine RNA-iMAX will be referred to as L-CpG.
As controls, the cells were also treated with L-ODN-scrambled
(L-ODN-scr) at the same concentration of L-CpG and

www.aacrjournals.org

Lipofectamine alone. 3H-Thymidine incorporation was quantified as described (20).
Cell viability assay
NB cells were cultured for 24 hours and then treated with
CpG and L-CpG, as described previously, for additional
48 hours. At the end of treatment, the cells were harvested
by scraping, washed with complete medium, and incubated
with 0.4% trypan blue (1:1; Invitrogen) for 1 minute at 37 C.
The cells were then counted using the Countess automated
cell counter (Invitrogen S.r.l.) as reported (18, 20).
Apoptosis assays
Phosphatidyl serine detection. NB cells were plated and
treated for 24 hours, as described earlier. Annexin V positivity
was detected by the use of a human Annexin V-FITC kit
(Bender MedSystems, Vienna, Austria), according to manufacturer's instructions (18, 20).
Caspase 3/7 activation. For the detection of caspase 3
and 7 cleavage activity, the Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase
3–7 Assay was used (Promega, Madison, WI), according to
manufacturer's instructions.
Mitochondrial membrane potential assay. The mitochondrial permeability transition event was evaluated
using a MitoPT kit (Immunochemistry Technologies, LLC,
Bloomington, MN) according to manufacturer's instructions
as described (20). (For details, see Supplementary Material.)
Inhibition of TLR9 functionality
SH-SY5Y and GI-LI-N cells were seeded in 96-well plate [(7–
9)  103 cells/well)]. Class 2 inhibitory oligonucleotides
(iODNs) [iODN (ttaggg)4 (TLRgrade), Alexis Biochemicals)]
were used to block TLR9 functionality. The cells were treated
simultaneously with CpG (4 mg/mL) and iODN (20 mg/mL).
In both cases, the administration was performed via
Lipofectamine RNA-iMAX. The cells were observed after
48 hours, using a contrast-phase microscope (Olympus Optical Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) to define morphologic changes, and
were photographed. Treated cells were also subjected to
evaluation of cell proliferation at 24 hours, as described earlier.
Silencing of TLR9
NB and Raji cells were seeded in 6-well plate in complete
medium. The day after, the cells were transfected with
siRNA specific for TLR9 (Select Pre-Designed siRNA; Applied
Biosystems/Ambion) for 14 hours in a serum-free medium.
Three different sequences of Select Pre-designed siRNA were
tested in silencing experiments; they will be referred hereafter as siRNA1-TLR9, siRNA2-TLR9, and siRNA3-TLR9. A
siRNA specific for the housekeeping gene GAPDH (siRNA
Custom; Applied Biosystems) and 1 siRNA negative control
(Silencer Negative Control #1; Applied Biosystems) were also
tested. For details on transfection and evaluation of efficiency of gene silencing, see Supplementary Material.
Western blot analysis
Protein lysates were prepared from various NB cell lines
(GI-LI-N, SK-NAS, IMR-32, SH-SY5Y, HTLA-230, LAN-5, and

GI-ME-N) and from either untreated or treated siRNAs against
TLR9, GI-LI-N, and HTLA-230 cells, as described (13). (For
details, see Supplementary Material.)
In vivo therapeutic studies
All experiments involving animals were reviewed and
approved by the licensing and ethical committee of the
National Cancer Research Institute, Genoa, Italy, and by the
Italian Ministry of Health. Five-week-old female, athymic
(nude–nude), SCID-bg mice were purchased from Harlan
Laboratories S.r.l. (S Pietro al Natisone, Italy). NOD/SCID/
IL2rg/ lacking the gene for the common gamma chain, a
component of the receptor for IL2, and related cytokines were
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
Mice were intravenously injected with 2.5  106 HTLA-230, as
previously described (11). HTLA-230 NB cell lines have been
chosen because they present high levels of both GD2 and TLR9
and thus can be considered as a good target for in vivo studies.
Mice were given intravenously injected with CpG (50 mg),
either free or encapsulated within NB-targeted liposomes (TLCpG). Control mice received HEPES-buffered saline. Treatment started 4 hours after cell challenge and continued for
2 weeks, 2 days per week, with a 3-day interval between
courses. Mice were monitored and sacrificed when signs of
poor health, such as abdominal dilatation, dehydration, or
paraplegia, became evident.
Patients and collection of tumor samples
Fifty NB specimens at the onset, collected from 1987 to
2000, were retrieved from the Italian Neuroblastoma Tissue
Bank by the Ethical Committee of the G. Gaslini Children's
Hospital. All patients or their parents gave informed consent.
Tumor cell content was consistently at least 80%, as assessed
by histologic analysis. Disease extension was classified according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System criteria (21). The specimens were from 10 patients with stage 1–
2, age <12 months, 10 patients with stage 1–2, age >12 months,
10 patients with stage 4S, and 20 patients with stage 4 tumors
(10 with no MYCN amplified and 10 MYCN amplified).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses were performed
using a staining method for sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on the Bond automated system (Vision
BioSystems, Leica, Germany), as detailed in Supplementary
Material.
Statistical analyses
All in vitro data are from at least 3 independent experiments. All the in vivo experiments were performed at least
twice with similar results.
Results are expressed as mean 95% confidence interval
values for quantitative variables and as numbers and percentages for qualitative ones. For continuous variables, the statistical significance of differential findings between the
experimental and control groups was determined by ANOVA
with the Tukey multiple comparisons test. The association
between categorical variables was assessed by the Fisher exact

9818

test. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan–Meier
method and compared by the Peto log-rank test. Both ANOVA
and log-rank tests were carried out using Graph-Pad Prism 3.0
software (Graph-Pad Software, Inc., El Camino Real, San
Diego, CA). The remaining analyses were performed by Stata
for Windows statistical package (release 9.2, Stata Corporation, College Station, TX). All tests were 2-sided and a value of
P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

Results
Effects of CpG on cell proliferation, cell death,
and apoptosis
Data in Figure 1 show that NB cells express TLR9 at both
mRNA and protein levels as assessed by real-time qPCR, flow
cytometry, and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A, B, and C,
respectively).
Thus, to investigate the functionality of TLR9 in NB cells,
PBMNC and NB cells were treated with CpG ODNs, at a
concentration (4 mg/mL) already shown to be stimulatory on
immunocompetent cells (22). CpG was delivered to cells either
free (CpG) or via Lipofectamine RNA-iMAX (L-CpG), here
used to allow the uptake of CpG into NB cells (23). Figure 2A
shows that L-CpG stimulated cell proliferation of PBMNC but
inhibited that of GI-LI-N NB cells. Free CpG showed activity
only on PBMNC, likely due to the different membrane permeability of ODNs presented by cells of hematopoietic origin with
respect to solid tumor-derived cells (23, 24). Furthermore, the
effect of L-CpG was specific: indeed, either Lipofectamine alone
or L-ODN-scr did not affect cell proliferation.
We then investigated whether L-CpG could also induce cell
death. As shown in Figure 2B, only treatment with L-CpG
induced GI-LI-N cell death whereas (L-CpG vs. control, P <
0.001) Lipofectamine or L-ODN-scr were not effective.
Cells treated with L-CpG displayed rounding up, retraction
of pseudopods, reduction of cellular volume, and blebbing of
the plasma membrane (Fig. 2C, left panel). All of these changes
are hallmarks of apoptotic cells. The apoptotic cell death was
further confirmed by an Annexin-V assay, in which Annexin-V
binds to externalized phosphatidyl serine on the surface of
apoptotic cells. As shown in Figure 2C, right panel, L-CpG–
treated GI-LI-N contained a significantly higher percentage of
Annexin Vþ apoptotic cells than control (L-CpG vs. control,
P < 0.001). The addition of a pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VADFMK) almost completely reverted the L-CpG–induced cell
apoptosis (L-CpG vs. Z-VAD-FMK þ L-CpG, P < 0.01), indicating the involvement of a caspase-dependent mechanism of
programmed cell death. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the
results obtained by treating IMR-32, GI-ME-N, HTLA-230, and
LAN-5, as described earlier. As confirmed by the Annexin-V
assay, all the cell lines tested responded to the treatment with
L-CpG undergoing apoptosis.
We next investigated whether the administration of L-CpG
induced cleavage of caspases 3 and 7. As clearly shown in
Figure 2D, left panel, the treatment of GI-LI-N cells with L-CpG
for 24 hours results in caspase 3 and 7 activation by cleavage.
The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib was used as the positive
control (20). Pretreatment of NB cells with Z-VAD-FMK

completely prevented CpG-induced caspase 3 and 7 cleavage.
However, pretreatment of NB cells with the antioxidant Nacetyl-cysteine (NAC), an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species
generation, was not effective in inhibiting caspase 3 and 7
cleavage.
Recently, caspases 3 and 7 have been reported to be key
mediators of some mitochondrial events of apoptosis (25).
Thus, we investigated whether the treatment of NB cells with
L-CpG was associated with the activation of the intrinsic

apoptotic signaling pathway. Treatment of GI-LI-N cells with
L-CpG caused a statistically significant decrease in mitochondria membrane potential with respect to the control (LCpG vs. control, P < 0.01; Fig. 2D, right panel). Pretreatment
with either Z-VAD-FMK or NAC increased the percentage of
cells with polarized mitochondria to the level of control.
These results indicate that TLR9 triggering with CpG ODNs
inhibits NB cell proliferation and induces cell death by
apoptosis.

TLR9 silencing and functionality
To show that the abrogation of TLR9 protein results in
CpG ODN loss of efficacy, we tested iODNs. Class 2 iODNs
used here are entirely composed of TTAGGG multimers
designed both to block the colocalization of CpG ODNs
with TLR9 within endosomal vesicles and to abrogate the
signaling cascade downstream to TLR9 (26, 27). This suppressive activity correlates with the ability of TTAGGG
motifs to form G-tetrads (26); these iODNs have been
initially synthesized with the aim to block the activation
of immune cells by CpG ODNs (28). They exert the inhibitory
effect when administered in molar excess with respect to
CpG ODNs. A 5-fold molar excess of iODN, with respect to LCpG, could almost completely revert the antiproliferative
effect obtained by the use of L-CpG on SH-SY5Y NB cells
(iODN þ L-CpG vs. L-CpG, P < 0.01; Fig. 3A). The iODN
administered alone, as control, did not affect cell growth.
Similar results were obtained for GI-LI-N cells (data not
shown). These results are further supported by the findings
shown in Figure 3B. Indeed, while SH-SY5Y cells treated with
L-CpG underwent apoptotic cell death, cells cotreated with
iODN, in molar excess with respect to L-CpG, had a morphologic aspect similar to untreated control cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

Silencing experiments were also performed first on Raji cell to
identify the more efficient TLR9-specific siRNA sequence and to
determine the time point at which the highest TLR9 silencing
was reached. As shown in Figure 3C, left panel, the GAPDH
housekeeping gene was drastically silenced, in a time-dependent
manner, reaching its maximum effect at 72 hours. Similarly,
TLR9 silencing was time dependent. Nevertheless, a high silencing efficiency was not obtained for all the siRNA sequences
used. Then, the 3 siRNA sequences were used to test their
efficiency on a panel of NB cell lines. Also, in this case, the
GAPDH gene was almost completely silenced at 72 hours
(Fig. 3C, right panel), whereas the best sequence of siRNA against
TLR9 (number 1) reduced TLR9 expression to about 60%. The
silencing efficiency was further investigated by Western blot
analysis. GI-LI-N and HTLA-230 cells were transfected with
siRNA1-TLR9 and siRNA2-TLR9 and harvested at 72 hours.
Both siRNA sequences failed to completely shutdown the
expression of the expected full-length TLR9 protein (140 kDa;
Fig. 3D), as well as of the cleaved isoforms (roughly 70–90 kDa).
These last proteins have been reported recently to be functional
also in macrophages (29). The expression of these low-molecular-weight isoforms has been confirmed in NB cells by a
different antibody (Ab) against TLR9 (data not shown).

(n ¼ 7). Mice were injected with HTLA-230 NB cells into the tail vein
and treated as reported in the Materials and Methods section.

Furthermore, as shown in Figure 3E, we showed that the
amount of TLR9 protein remaining after silencing was still
functional and sufficient to respond to L-CpG. Indeed, transfection of GI-LI-N cells for 72 hours with siRNA1-TLR9 only
marginally reverted the inhibition of cell proliferation induced
by a 24-hour treatment protocol with L-CpG.
These results clearly show that low-level expression of TLR9
in NB cells is sufficient to allow full functionality of this receptor.
In vivo effects of CpG
We next investigated whether CpG had antitumor activity
in a biologically and clinically relevant pseudometastatic
mouse model of human NB cell (11). The in vitro delivery
of ODNs to solid tumor-derived cells is usually accomplished
by carriers such as lipidic vesicles and cationic polymers (23,
24), whose utilization, in turn, can lead to in vivo limitations
due mostly to the lack of specificity for target cells and some
systemic toxicity (30, 31).
We have previously developed a standardized method to
efficiently deliver ODNs to neuroectodermal tumors via dis-

9822

Cancer Res; 70(23) December 1, 2010

ialoganglioside, GD2 (13), which is abundantly expressed at the
cell surface of NB cells whereas its expression in normal tissues
is very limited (32). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recognizing
GD2 bind to NB cells with high affinity and specificity and are
rapidly internalized after binding, thus becoming an excellent
tool for liposome-mediated tumor targeting (33). We therefore
decided to use GD2-targeted liposomes as vehicles for the
in vivo intracellular delivery of CpG into GD2þ human NB cells.
The high selectivity of this approach is guaranteed by the lack
of GD2 expression in any mouse tissue (34).
NB-targeted liposomes containing CpG (TL-CpG) were thus
administered in vivo for therapeutic purposes. As shown in
Figure 4A, both CpG and TL-CpG significantly prolonged
the survival of tumor-bearing Nude mice (P < 0.0001). Interestingly, mice treated with TL-CpG lived longer than those
treated with CpG (P ¼ 0.0154), being all animals cured 6 months
after NB-cell inoculation. This impressive antitumor effect
obtained with TL-CpG is likely due to a dual attack of tumor
cells. First, liposomal formulations containing CpG ODNs
activate the host immune system to kill NB cells through a
NK cell–dependent mechanism (11). Second, TL-CpG acts
directly on NB cells binding to TLR9 and causes their apoptosis.
In SCID-bg mice, lacking B and NK cells (11), similar results
were unexpectedly obtained. Indeed, at 6 months after tumor
challenge, animals treated with TL-CpG were all alive (TL-CpG
vs. control, P ¼ 0.0004) whereas about 40% of long-term
survival was obtained for those treated with free CpG
(Fig. 4B; TL-CpG vs. CpG, P ¼ 0.023). Although in our previous
work (11), administration of liposomal CpG-containing antisense ODNs to tumor-bearing SCID-bg mice lost its antitumor
effectiveness, the present finding is in agreement with other
studies showing that, upon activation with CpG, macrophages
acquired cytotoxic potential against tumor cells (35). To definitively overcome the influence of the immune system in our
therapeutic results, and to distinguish the direct effects of TLCpG on tumor cells, we thus used NOD/SCID/IL2rg/ mice.
This mouse model lacks B and NK cells and presents macrophages with an impaired functionality (36). In this mouse
model, treatment with CpG alone was completely ineffective
with respect to control animals while TL-CpG treatment still
maintained antitumor efficacy leading to an increased life span
with respect to controls (Fig. 4C, P ¼ 0.0002).
TLR9 expression in primary NB tumors
We analyzed 50 NB specimens at different stages by IHC
analysis, as detailed in the Material and Methods section. NB
specimens were scored as negative, weak, moderate, or strong
with respect to the expression of TLR9.
Figure 5A,a and A,b shows a negative control stained with
an isotype-matched irrelevant antibody and a TLR9-positive
control, respectively, both from a pulmonary adenocarcinoma
specimen. TLR9 positivity was graded by the intensity of
cytoplasmic staining. Panels A,c to A,f show representative
micrographs of TLR9 expression in NB specimens. Specifically,
panel A,c is negative for TLR9 expression and representative of
a stage 4, MYCN-amplified tumor. Panel A,e shows weak TLR9
expression in a stage 4, MYCN nonamplified tumor. Panel A,f
shows moderate TLR9 expression in a stage 4S patient and,

finally, panel A,d represents strong TLR9 expression from a
stage 1 tumor.
Histogram representation (Fig. 5B) gives a semiquantitative
scoring of the immunostaining, assessed by the Quick Score
method, adapted from commonly used method for breast
carcinomas (37). This panel clearly shows that the expression
of TLR9 is inversely related to the stage of the disease. Indeed,
the highest expression of TLR9 is present in stage 1–2 and
stage 4S NB patients whereas about 50% of stage 4 patients are
completely negative. The association between TLR9 and clinicopathologic features is also illustrated in Table 1. High TLR9
expression was prevalent in stage 1–2 (100%) and stage 4S
(80%) patients, whereas much lower TLR9 expression was
observed in the stage 4 group (85%, P < 0.0001). Furthermore,
high TLR9 expression was associated with low age at diagnosis
(P ¼ 0.018) and normal MYCN status (P ¼ 0.030).

Discussion
The significance of TLR9 expression and its biological
impact in tumor cells is yet to be completely understood.

The aim of this study was to investigate expression, functionality, and biological relevance of TLR9 in NB. Here, we showed,
for the first time to our knowledge, that NB cells express TLR9,
both at the mRNA and protein levels. In this respect, a
previous report showed that human NB cells also express
an intracellular form of TLR4 (38).
Previous reports indicate that triggering of TLR9 expressed
by different malignant cells could lead to opposite effects, that
is, stimulation of tumor progression or inhibition of tumor
growth (4). Indeed, in TLR9-expressing human prostate cancer
cells (39), treatment with CpG damped tumor growth and
proliferation and induced apoptosis whereas it prolonged the
survival of glioma-bearing mice (40). Moreover, Ren et al. (41)
showed that human lung cancer cells expressed functional
TLR9 and its stimulation enhanced their metastatic potential.
In this article, we show that TLR9 expression has a functional
impact on NB cell growth, as stimulation of this receptor with
CpG triggered tumor cell death. The latter was attributable
to apoptosis, as shown by the involvement of caspases 3 and
7. Because apoptosis may occur through the activation of
a different and independent pathway, we also investigated

mitochondrial cell death. Indeed, the treatment of NB cells with
CpG resulted in the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential; this event is thought to contribute to cell death
through the disruption of the normal function of mitochondria
(42). Although caspases 3 and 7 have been so far considered as
effector caspases downstream to mitochondrial related apoptosis, it was recently reported that these caspases are crucial for
apoptotic cell death (25). We found that pretreatment of NB
cells with a pan-caspase inhibitor prevented CpG-induced
caspase 3 and 7 cleavage activation as well as the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. Nevertheless, the
use of the antioxidant NAC prevented mitochondrial membrane depolarization but not caspase 3 and 7 activation. These
findings are consistent with a previous report (25) showing that
caspases 3 and 7 work upstream of the mitochondrial pathway
and suggest that free radicals could be one of the intermediate
in this pathway of apoptosis.
The functionality of TLR9 in NB was further proved with
experiments in which iODNs abrogated CpG-mediated apoptosis. Silencing experiments were also performed to support
this finding. However, none of the 3 TLR9-specific siRNA
sequences completely abrogated TLR9 expression. This finding
is consistent with a recent report in which investigators, by
using RNA interference, downregulated only partially the
expression of TLR9 in dendritic cells. Nevertheless, such downregulation was sufficient to abrogate the effects of CpG ODNs in
the induction of dendritic cells maturation (43). In contrast, we
observed that all NB-cell lines transfected with siRNA against
TLR9 retained the ability to respond to CpG, undergoing
apoptosis. Thus, also NB cells expressing very low amount of
TLR9 may be responsive to treatment with CpG ODNs. This
conclusion is supported by the lack of correlation between

TLR9 expression and apoptotic response to L-CpG observed in
the various NB cell lines, further underlining that a very little
TLR9 seems to be needed for maximal CpG responses.
In vivo experiments were performed in a biologically and
clinically relevant mouse model of human NB (11). Because the
most frequently used DNA carriers lack specificity to target
cells, we have generated tumor-targeted delivery of CpG ODNs,
specific for NB cells via anti-GD2–targeted stealth liposomes
(herein called TL-CpG), which have been shown to be the most
efficient and safe envelop packaged way to transfer nucleic acid
into neuroectodermal tumors cells (11, 13).
TL-CpG showed higher antitumor effect in NB animal models than CpG, becoming a candidate for further clinical development. In the last few years, nanomedicine has turned into a
rapid growth research area, particularly for anticancer applications. Several nanomedicines, primarily lipid-based drug carriers such as DOXIL/Caelyx (Ortho Biotech; Janssen
Pharmaceutical Companies), have received clinical approval
and several lipid-based and polymeric carriers are undergoing
clinical evaluation (44). A logical extension of this success is to
further improve the antitumor effects of liposomal nanomedicines in a more selective manner through the use of ``activetargeting moieties'' coupled to their external surface. Receptormediated internalization of nanomedicines into tumor cells is
mandatory for improved therapeutic efficacy of targeted liposomal drugs (45). In this regard, the disialoganglioside GD2 is an
internalizing receptor selectively expressed by neuroectoderma-derived tumor cells only of human origin (32–34, 46,
47), including the HTLA-230 cell line used in this study. Our
results indicated that liposomal CpG could enter into the NB
cells when targeted via the anti-GD2 mAb coupled at the
external surface of the nanoparticles but not in the absence

of the targeting agent, as already shown for antisense ODNs and
different antitumor drugs (11, 13). These results support the
direct effect of CpG on TLR9 expressed by NB cells.
TL-CpG triggered long-term survival of NB-bearing Nude
mice, which was significantly superior to that achieved by
administering CpG alone. This result could be due to a dual
mechanism of action of TL-CpG. Indeed, liposomes containing
CpG ODNs can also work as activators of the immune system,
giving rise to a cascade of events that culminate in the
activation of NK cells and consequent tumor cells killing
carried out by NK cells themselves (11). Furthermore, CpG
and TL-CpG both showed efficacy in SCID-bg mice, even if at
different extent, confirming the implication of the immune
system in the antitumor result. Because SCID-bg mice lack B
and NK cells, our data could be explained by macrophage
intervention upon activation with CpG (35). The definitive
abrogation of immune system implication in therapeutic
results was obtained by the use of NOD/SCID/IL2rg/, which
besides NK- and B-cell deficiency further presents the myeloid
lineage with an impaired functionality (48). Indeed, it has been
suggested that macrophages in NOD mice are functionally
immature. As expected, the only effective treatment in this
model was TL-CpG, which led to an increased life span. Thus,
the potent antitumor effect of TL-CpG also seems to be due to
a direct antitumor effect of CpG on NB cells, which, as shown
in this study, express TLR9 as a functional intracellular ``death
receptor.''
Investigations of TLR9 expression in NB patients have
highlighted an inverse correlation between the stage of the
disease and the levels of TLR9 expression (P < 0.0001). Low
stages of NB disease are indeed characterized by moderate-tostrong TLR9 expression, whereas high stages are either negative or weakly/moderately positive. The strong expression of

TLR9 in stage 4S and stage 1–2 tumors from patients younger
than 12 months may hypothesize that TLR9 could be one of
the molecules involved in transdifferentiation, apoptosis, and/
or spontaneous regression of low-stage NB (9, 10). This
hypothesis may be supported by the correlation between high
TLR9 expression and age younger than 12 months (P ¼ 0.018).
In contrast, NB cells lacking TLR9 (advanced stages) may be
prone to tumor progression.
Studies are ongoing to verify, in larger cohort of NB patients,
whether the expression of TLR9 correlates also with the
outcome of the disease. In such case, TLR9 could become a
new prognostic marker for NB.
In conclusion, this study showed for the first time that TLR9
is expressed by NB, is functional, and has a biological impact
on tumor growth, thus suggesting that TLR9 can be considered as a new molecular target for NB treatment.
