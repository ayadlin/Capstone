Abstract:
Gene-based anticancer therapies delivered by adenoviruses are limited by the
poor viral distribution into the tumor. In the current work we have explored the
feasibility of targeting pancreatic tumors through a loco-regional route.
We have taken advantage of the ductal network in the pancreas to retrogradelly
inject adenoviruses through the common bile duct in two different mouse models of
pancreatic carcinogenesis: The transgenic Ela-myc mice that develop mixed neoplasms
displaying both acinar-like and duct-like neoplastic cells affecting the whole pancreas;
and mice bearing PANC-1 and BxPC-3 orthotopic xenografts that constitute a model
of localized human neoplastic tumors. We studied tumor targeting and the anticancer
effects of newly thymidine kinase-engineered adenoviruses both in vitro and in vivo,
and conducted comparative studies between intraductal or intravenous administration.
Our data indicate that the intraductal delivery of adenovirus efficiently targets
pancreatic tumors in the two mouse models. The in vivo application of AduPARTKT plus
ganciclovir (GCV) treatment induced tumor regression in Ela-myc mice. Moreover, the
intraductal injection of ICOVIR15-TKT oncolytic adenoviruses significantly improved
mean survival of mice bearing PANC-1 and BxPC-3 pancreatic xenografts from 30 to
52 days and from 20 to 68 days respectively (p<0.0001) when combined with GCV.
Of notice, both AduPARTKT and ICOVIR15-TKT antitumoral responses were stronger
by ductal viral application than intravenously, in line with the 38-fold increase in
pancreas transduction observed upon ductal administration.
In summary our data show that cytotoxic adenoviruses retrogradelly injected to
the pancreas can be a feasible approach to treat localized pancreatic tumors.

INTRODUCTION

with a median survival of 6 months and a 5-year survival
of less than 5%. Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed
at late stages and only 10-15% of patients present with
operable disease. About 25% of unresectable PDACs
are locally advanced and the rest are metastatic. The
only potentially curative treatment is complete surgical
resection of the tumor. Currently, the survival of non-

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the
predominant form of pancreatic cancer and is one of the
most aggressive and devastating human malignancies
in developed countries. It is the fourth leading cause of
cancer related deaths and has an extremely poor prognosis,

resected patients is not fundamentally altered by any
particular general therapy [1].
Gene therapy and virotherapy represent promising
new therapeutic modalities for cancer. Among them,
oncolytic adenoviruses are at the front line of anticancer
agents. They are engineered to specifically target,
replicate in and destroy cancer cells [2-4]. The possibility
to arm the viruses with transgenes has resulted in
improved antitumoral agents. However, the efficacy
of these therapies is highly dependent on the capacity
of adenoviruses to enter tumor cells and to distribute
throughout the tumor. Commonly, they are applied in
vivo through intratumoral injections or by systemic
delivery. However, both intratumoral and intravenous
administrations result in reduced spread of the viruses
throughout the tumor limiting their therapeutic impact [5].
The exocrine pancreas is a secretory organ from
which cells release digestive enzymes or ions through
a complex network of ducts. Such network is well
organized in a ductal tree that branches from the main
duct to small interlobular ducts, generating intralobular
and intercalated ducts [6]. In the present study we have
taken advantage of such ductal network to address the
feasibility to target pancreatic tumors by the retrograde
delivery of adenoviruses into the common bile duct.
This technique is similar to the endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography, which has been established
as a safe procedure in humans [7] and previous studies
have shown that adenovirus and adeno-associated virus
can be efficiently delivered to the mouse pancreas by
this approach [8, 9]. We have analyzed adenoviral tumor
targeting in the transgenic Ela-myc mouse model of
pancreatic tumorogenesis and in pancreatic orthotopic
xenografts. Ela-myc mice express oncogene c-myc under
the elastase promoter and develop mixed acinar-ductal
tumors in a ductal architecture that resembles PDAC [10,
11] which makes them an interesting model to evaluate
the potential of the intraductal delivery route; however,
the study of adenoviral therapies is limited to the use of
recombinant adenovirus because mouse cells are poorly
permissive to human adenovirus replication [12]. Thus,
to evaluate the potential therapeutic value of oncolytic
adenoviruses when applied intraductally, human orthotopic
xenografts have been used as a model. Antitumoral effects
have been evaluated by administering TK-engineered
adenoviruses: the recombinant AduPARTKT and the
oncolytic adenovirus ICOVIR15-TKT. Our data shows
that intraductal administration is an effective delivery
route to target tumors with adenoviruses and ICOVIR15TKT is a potent oncolytic adenovirus that provides with
antitumor efficacy when combined with GCV. Noticeable
significantly enhanced anticancer effects were obtained,
upon intraductal administration compared to systemic
injection. We propose the intraductal delivery as a novel
route to administer adenoviruses to pancreatic cancer
patients.

Intraductal delivery of reporter adenoviruses
targets pancreatic tumors in transgenic Ela-myc
mice
AdCMVGFPLuc reporter adenovirus was injected
into the common bile duct of 11-weeks-old transgenic Elamyc and wild type (wt) mice. At this age all transgenic
mice exhibited acinar neoplasms and 77% displayed a
mixed acinar-ductal phenotype with tumor nodules ranging
from 2-7 mm in diameter (Supplementary Fig. S1) [10].
Bioluminiscence imaging revealed luciferase expression
restricted to the pancreas (Fig. 1A). Quantification
of luciferase activity in tissue extracts showed higher
activity in the pancreas of wt animals at all the time-points
analyzed, that peaked at day 4 in both wt and Ela-myc
mice (Fig. 1B). To enhance tumor selectivity AduPARLuc
adenovirus was intraductally injected, previous data from
our group has shown that AduPARLuc was highly active
in tumor cells with reduced expression in normal tissue
[13]. Taking advantage of the double cassette (CMVp/
GFP and uPARp/Luc) in the AduPARluc virus, in the
current study we show that AduPARLuc intraductally
administered, broadly reaches the pancreas (strong
GFP immunoreactivity) while uPAR promoter limits
luciferase expression (weak luciferase signal) in normal
pancreas (Fig. 1C, left panel). In line with these results,
luciferase activity in the AduPARLuc injected pancreas
was 2-log reduced when compared to AdCMVGFPLuc
(Fig. 1C, right panel). Pancreatic tumor selectivity was
confirmed in AduPARLuc injected animals showing a
significantly higher (8,34-fold, p=0.016) cancer-specific
index (established as a tumor to pancreas ratio) (Fig. 1D).
This was in line with the observation that the uPAR gene
was highly expressed in Ela-myc tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S2). High intratumoral activity of uPAR controlled
adenovirus was also evident from the analysis of antiluciferase immunohistochemistry in Ela-myc tumors
intraductally injected with AduPARLuc. Strong positive
staining of acinar hyperplasic regions (Fig. 1E, left panel)
and extensive areas of ductal-like tumor masses with dense
stroma were observed (Fig. 1E, middle and right panels).

Intraductally delivered AduPARTKT adenovirus
followed by GCV treatment triggers an
antitumoral response in Ela-myc mice
To evaluate the potential of adenoviral-based
therapies to induce antitumoral effects upon application of
this newly proposed route of virus administration, first we
generated recombinant adenovirus expressing a modified
form of the TK gene (TKT) under the control of the uPAR

of the AduPARTKT/GCV suicide gene therapy, we first

tumors. These cell lines expressed ductal markers as well

pancreatic cancer cells. To this end cells were transduced
with increasing doses of AduPARTKT and cell viability
was analyzed after 3 days in culture in the presence of the
prodrug GCV. MTT assays showed that the AduPARTKT/
GCV treatment was able to induce cytotoxicity in Emyc
cells to a larger extent than in PANC-1 or BxPC-3 cells, as
evidenced by a shift to the left in the dose-response curve
and by displaying the lowest ID50 value, indicating higher
sensitivity to the treatment (Fig. 2A). To further analyze
the cytotoxicity of the AduPARTKT/GCV system in
Emyc cells, we evaluated for the presence of a bystander
effect and compared it to that of PANC-1 cells, a cell line
reported to have a moderate TK/GCV bystander effect
[14]. Cells were transduced with AdTK at a viral dose
corresponding to its ID90, and designated as TK+ positive
cells. Cocultures of 50% TK+ and 50% TK- cells were
established at high confluence and treated with GCV for 3
days. Under these conditions the presence of a bystander
effect would be detected when viability reached values
below 55%. MTT analysis revealed that the survival of
the Emyc-3 cocultures (15%) was significantly lower than
that of PANC-1 (28%) (Fig. 2B, left panel). The enhanced
effect in Emyc-3 cells could be, at least partially explained
by the expression of connexin-43, a well-known mediator
of the TK/GCV bystander effect (Fig. 2B, right panel)
[14].
To analyze whether the cytotoxic effects of
AduPARTKT/GCV would translate into an antitumor
response, 11-weeks-old Ela-myc mice were randomly
distributed into five groups. Mice received intraductal
injections of PBS, AduPARTKT (5x1010 vp) or
AduPARTKT (1011vp); three days later, when stated, a
daily dose of GCV (100 mg/Kg) was administered for
6 consecutive days and six weeks after viral injection
antitumor effects were determined. Given the fact that
at 17-weeks of age the whole pancreas of Ela-myc mice
displays carcinogenic lesions, the measure of pancreatic
volume was used as an indicator of treatment effects.
The three control groups that received PBS, GCV or
AduPARTKT alone showed large pancreatic volumes (1.8fold over the pancreas of wild type mice). By contrast,
animals treated with AduPARTKT and GCV presented
pancreatic volumes significantly smaller and similar to
those of wild type animals. No differences were observed
between the two viral doses (Fig. 2C). Of note, in a group
of mice, tumor nodules observed at surgery completely
regressed by treatment.
We reasoned that the presence of a large tumor in
the pancreas could alter normal pancreatic function. In
this line we assessed the levels of the pancreatic enzymes
amylase and lipase in the serum of untreated Ela-myc
mice. At 12-weeks of age Ela-myc mice already presented
amylase levels above the reference range that dramatically
increased by week 17. Lipase activity gradually increased
over-time, reaching a 2.7-fold increase on the reference
values by week 17 (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, AduPARTKT/

GCV treatment resulted in normalization of the serum
pancreatic enzymes (Fig. 2D).
These findings reveal that the intraductal delivery of
AduPARTKT followed by GCV reduces tumor progression
and ameliorates pancreatic dysfunction in Ela-myc mice.

adenoviruses expressing the TK gene when combined
with GCV present enhanced antitumoral response and
can be traced in vivo by PET imaging [15]. However, the
limited genome encapsidation capacity of adenoviruses
results in packaging problems when the TK gene is
inserted. Interestingly a constrained genome size in an
ICOVIR-15 backbone has been reported to allow for
efficient transgene expression and oncolytic potency
[16]. In this regard, we generated the ICOVIR15-TKT by
inserting the TK gene into the ICOVIR15 genome (Fig.
3A). Tumor selectivity of ICOVIR-15 was achieved by
inserting eight E2F-binding sites and one Sp1-binding
site in the E1A endogenous promoter. The TK gene was
inserted downstream of the fiber gene under the control of
the Major Late Promoter as previously reported [17]. The
oncolytic potency of ICOVIR15-TKT plus GCV was first

tumors in the pancreas and E1A expression was evaluated
in tumor sections. Strong E1A immunoreactivity was
detected throughout the tumor (Fig. 3C). The antitumoral
efficacy of ICOVIR15-TKT was studied in the presence
and the absence of GCV and compared to that of the
parental oncolytic virus ICOVIR-15. Pancreatic xenograts
from PANC-1-Luc and BxPC-3-Luc cells were treated
with a single dose of saline, ICOVIR-15 or ICOVIR15TKT at 5x1010 vp/mouse administered intraductally. Mice
injected with ICOVIR15-TKT were split in two groups,
one receiving intraperitoneal GCV (100 mg/Kg) at the
time points indicated in the scheme, while the other
group received saline solution (Fig. 3D). Treatment with
ICOVIR-15 and ICOVIR15-TKT improved survival in the
two xenograft models. Interestingly an enhanced effect
was observed with the combined treatment of ICOVIR15TKT+GCV. Median overall survival increased from 30
days to 35 for ICOVIR15-TKT; to 42 for ICOVIR-15
and to 52 for ICOVIR15-TKT+GCV in the PANC-1Luc model. Similarly, in the BxPC-3-Luc model overall
survival increased from 20 days for untreated mice to
29 for ICOVIR15-TKT; 30 for ICOVIR-15 and to 68 for
ICOVIR15-TKT+ GCV (Fig. 3D). Thus, the ICOVIR15TKT in combination with GCV resulted the most effective
treatment in the two pancreatic xenograft models.

intraductal delivery suggesting that adenoviruses reached
more efficiently pancreatic tumors (Fig. 4B). Furthermore
the enhanced tumor/liver ratio is an indication that through
this route adenoviral-induced liver damage effects could
be minimized.
To compare the antitumor efficacy of cytotoxic
adenoviruses following intravenous or intraductal
administration, AduPARTKT were injected i.v. or i.d to
Ela-myc mice and 3 days later they received GCV for
six consecutive days. Six weeks after viral administration
mice were sacrificed and the pancreatic volume was
measured. Saline injected animals presented a large
pancreas, indicative of tumor progression, whereas
both i.v. and i.d injected mice showed reduced volume
demonstrating antitumor efficacy. The major effect was
observed in mice that received the virus intraductally (Fig.
4C).
To further determine the therapeutic potential of
i.d. delivery, antitumor efficacy was also evaluated by
applying 5x 1010 vp of oncolytic ICOVIR15-TKT i.v. or
i.d followed by GCV treatment in BxPC-3-Luc pancreatic
xenografts, as scheduled in Fig. 3D. Tumor progression
was analyzed by measuring luciferase expression. An
exponential increase in luciferase activity was detected
in the control group. By contrast, ICOVIR15-TKT i.v
delivered showed a slight increase on luciferase activity
over time indicating limited tumor growth; interestingly
the intraductal delivery of ICOVIR15-TKT resulted
in similar luciferase activity at all the time-points
analyzed indicative of no tumor growth (Fig. 4D, left
panel). Furthermore, ICOVIR15-TKT+GCV prolonged
mouse survival after both intravenous and intraductal
administration, although a remarkable increased survival
was observed through intraductal delivery. The median
survival in mice bearing BxPC3-Luc tumors was of 20
days for the mock group and of 38 days for the i.v. treated
group and of 68 days for the i.d. treated group (Fig. 4D,
right panel).
In summary, these results indicate that the
intraductal delivery of adenoviruses is more successful
than the intravenous delivery to target pancreatic tumors
and induces stronger antitumoral effects.

Intraductal delivery of cytotoxic adenoviruses
triggers a significantly higher antitumoral
response than intravenous administration
Anticancer adenoviral based therapies are often
applied through intravenous delivery. This route of
administration is necessary to target disseminated cancer,
however its hepatotoxic related effects encourage the use
of alternative routes for the treatment of localized tumors.
We sought to perform a comparative study between
the intraductal (i.d) and intravenous (i.v) delivery of
adenoviruses and assess tumor targeting efficiency and
therapeutic response. First, 5x 1010 viral particles of
AdCMVGFPLuc were injected into the tail vein or the
common bile duct of wild type and Ela-myc mice. Four
days later animals were sacrificed and bioluminescence
was measured and quantified in the pancreas and the liver
of injected animals. As shown in figure 4A following
intravenous injection the strongest signal was detected in
the liver at similar levels in both wild type and Ela-myc
mice, whereas lower luciferase expression was detected
in the pancreas. On the contrary, intraductal injection
resulted in elevated luciferase activity in the pancreas
and much lower values were detected in the liver (Fig.
4A). Noticeably, adenoviruses reached the pancreas both
in wt and Ela-myc mice more efficiently upon intraductal
delivery than following intravenous injection (38-fold
and 5-fold respectively). Moreover, in Ela-myc mice the
pancreas to liver ratio was significantly higher following

DISCUSSION
One of the major hurdles to meaningful treatment
of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by adenoviral-based
therapies, is their relatively limited ability to spread
throughout the tumor. In the present study we have
explored the feasibility to achieve antitumoral effects by
delivering adenoviruses by retrograde injection into the
common bile duct with the aim to spread the virus into
the tumor throughout the complex network of pancreatic
ducts. We have tested this strategy in two different
experimental models of pancreatic tumorogenesis, the
transgenic Ela-myc mice that develop autochthonous

tumors in the pancreas and a human cell transplantation
model of orthotopic pancreatic xenografts. Our results
show that in both models adenovirus, when delivered
intraductally, are able to target the tumors generated in
the pancreas as it can be visualized by the expression of
luciferase in the pancreatic tumor nodules of transgenic
mice and the immunodetection of E1A protein in the
xenografted tumors. It has been proposed that tumor cells
arising in situ in the native organ are distinct from cells
engrafted into an immunocompromised mouse [18]. In this
regard, tumors generated in the transgenic mice provide a
more adequate tumor context for therapeutic evaluation.
However, mouse cells are not permissive to human
adenoviral replication thus, the study of antitumor effects
of therapeutic adenoviruses in transgenic mice upon
intraductal delivery was limited to the use of recombinant
adenovirus expressing the suicide gene thymidine kinase
(AduPARTKT) in combination with GCV. With this
approach we observed a significant anticancer response
at the two viral doses tested resulting in a pancreas size at
week 6 after treatment similar to that of wild type animals,
whereas control groups doubled the pancreatic mass.
This good response was probably the result of a good
sensitivity of the Ela-myc tumor cells to the TK/GCV
cytotoxicity, as shown in the in vitro data, as well as to the
spread of the virus into the tumor mass as a consequence
of the intraductal adenoviral delivery. Furthermore, the
strong activity of the uPAR promoter in the tumor tissue
also represents a relevant contributing factor.
Oncolytic adenoviruses are promising agents for the
treatment of cancer and the possibility to arm the virus
with toxic transgenes further provides with enhanced
potency. The potential of the intraductal delivery as a
route for pancreatic cancer treatment with oncolytic
adenoviruses was evaluated in orthotopic xenografts
models. We have previously shown some of the advantages
of the combined therapy of adenoviral replication and TK/
GCV cytotoxicity: i) the improvement of the antitumoral
response under a defined regimen of virus and GCV and
ii) the possibility to monitor viral activity non-invasively
by PET imaging based on TK expression [15, 17]. Here
we report that GCV increases the cellular killing effect
of the minimal RB responsive-based selective adenovirus
armed with the TK gene (ICOVIR15-TKT), inducing
significantly higher antitumor response than the potent
oncolytic ICOVIR15 upon intraductal delivery in two
different xenograft models of human pancreatic cancer
BxPC-3-Luc and PANC-1-Luc. These data are in contrast
to what is observed in vitro where ICOVIR15 is more
active than ICOVIR15-TKT. The compromised activity
of ICOVIR15-TKT might be probably related to the
limitations that adenoviruses have to efficiently package
large genomes. ICOVIR15-TKT has a 1.2Kb genome
larger than ICOVIR15 what makes the virus less efficient
in replication. The addition of GCV, which triggers the
cell killing effect mediated by ganciclovir metabolites in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ICOVIR15-TKT +GCV treated cells fully compensates
for this effect in BxPC-3-Luc cells, but only partially in
the PANC-1-Luc model. The differences between cell
lines may obey to their different sensitivity to cell death
mediated by oncolysis or through TK/GCV cytotoxicity.
However in vivo, viral replication does not seem to be
a limiting factor, probably because there are many other
tumor barriers that affect similarly to all the viruses.
Interestingly, in vivo the treatment with ICOVIR15-TKT
+GCV produces a major antitumoral effect, probably
because GCV toxic metabolites can spread to noninfected neighbouring tumoral or stromal cells increasing
tumor cell destruction [19, 20]. The intraductal delivery
of ICOVIR15-TKT followed by GCV treatment induced
a significantly higher antitumoral response than the same
treatment when the virus was administered systemically.
The improved anticancer response of intraductal
compared to intravenous delivery was also observed in
the AduPARTKT/GCV therapy in transgenic Ela-myc
mice. This improved response was most probably related
to an increased presence of adenoviral particles in the
tumor upon intraductal delivery as suggested by the higher
expression of luciferase in Ela-myc tumors after reporter
virus injection. These results suggest that the spreading of
the viral particles throughout the tumor mass is facilitated
by the ductal network favoring tumor cell transduction.
However it is important to note that the presence of the
tumor stroma might impair a complete antitumor response.
It is well known that the composition and structure of the
extracellular matrix (ECM) can slow down the movement
of molecules within the tumor [21]. In this line it could be
speculated that the incorporation of an enzymatic agent
that degrades ECM components could further facilitate
viral tumor biodistribution and further extend survival.
Recent reports have shown that the co-administration
of hyaluronidase and an oncolytic adenovirus or the
expression of hyaluronidase in an armed oncolytic virus
improves the spread of the virus throughout the tumor [22,
23]. The benefits of hyaluronidase as an adjuvant regimen
has also been shown to enhance gemcitabine anticancer
effects [24, 25]. Therefore it would be worth to test the
effects of co-treatment with hyaluronidase in adenoviral
intraductal administrations.
The injection through the common bile duct or
intraductal administration employed in the present study
is an adaptation of the human ERCP technique. Although
it is considered a safe technique, in around 10% of cases
leads to a complication of acute pancreatitis which can be
significantly reduced by administration of indomethacin
[7, 26]. Transgenic Ela-myc mice already present signs
of pancreatitis as shown by the elevated serum amylase
and lipase levels. Although we can not discard that the
intraductal delivery of adenovirus could induce additional
pancreatitis at early stages, our data shows that since
the initial phases of the treatment, AduPARTKT/GCV
normalizes amylase and lipase serum levels. Another
101

important aspect related to the safety of the delivery route
is its minimal impact in other organs, as it is demonstrated
by the higher ratio pancreas/liver achieved upon intraductal
delivery when compared to intravenous administration in
transgenic Ela-myc mice. This selectivity could minimize
the liver-related toxicity associated to adenoviral systemic
delivery [27]. Another major advantage of the intraductal
delivery versus systemic administration is the potential
to apply repeatable administrations. It is well known that
readministration of an adenovirus of the same serotype is
not indicated upon systemic delivery because it triggers
the formation of neutralizing antibodies. Although we
have not directly evaluated the feasibility of repeated
administrations, Tominaga and collaborators showed with
a very similar approach that readministration of adenoviral
particles into the common bile duct of wild type mice
resulted in efficient transgene expression without the need
of any immunosuppressive strategies [28].
In summary, we have shown that retrograde
intraductal adenoviral administration can be a feasible
approach to efficiently and selectively target pancreatic
tumors. Moreover the intraductal application of
AduPARTKT and ICOVIR-15TKT in combination with
GCV elicits significantly higher antitumor responses than
the systemic delivery. These data highlight the potential of
intraductal adenoviral delivery for the treatment of nonmetastatic pancreatic neoplasms.

Thymidine Kinase (HSV-TK) under the control of a CMV
promoter. In the present work we have generated the
recombinant adenovirus AduPARTKT and the oncolytic
virus ICOVIR15-TKT. The AduPARTKT recombinant
adenovirus was generated by inserting the 1.2 kb sequence
of the Tat8TK gene, a modified TK with enhanced
cytotoxicity [33], into the NotI/XhoI sites of the pShuttle
vector (Stratagene). Next, the SV40 polyA tail was cloned
into the XhoI/XbaI sites of the previously generated
plasmid, and the uPAR promoter (450 bp fragment)
was inserted into the NotI site. Next, homologous
recombination of the resulting pShuttle vector with the
adenoviral genome was carried following a standard
protocol. Viral particles were obtained and propagated in
HEK293 cells. Oncolytic ICOVIR15-TKT adenovirus was
constructed by first generating the plasmid pICOVIR15TKT. This plasmid was constructed by homologuos
recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [34] using
SpeI-digested pICOVIR15 plasmid [16] as acceptor
vector, and the SalI-PacI right end adenovirus genome
fragment from plasmid pICOVIR5-TK-L [15] as donor
insert. pICOIVR15-TKT was cut with PacI and transfected
in HEK293 cells to generate ICOVIR15-TKT, which was
plaque isolated and propagated in A549 cells. All viruses
were purified by standard cesium chloride banding and the
physical particle concentration (vp/ml) was determined by
optical density reading (OD260).

METHODS

Western blot analysis
Western blots were performed as previously
described [14] and imaged on a LAS-3000 image analyzer
(Fuji PhotoFilm Co.). Anti-Connexin43 (MAB3068,
Chemicon International) and anti-α-tubulin (T9026,
Sigma-Aldrich) were used as primary antibodies.

Cell lines
HEK293 cells and the human pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cell lines PANC-1, BxPC-3, were
obtained from the American Type Cancer Collection
(ATCC). PANC-1-Luc and BxPC-3-Luc were obtained
and maintained as described previously [13, 29]. Emyc
cells were established in our laboratory from pancreatic
tumors of Ela-myc mice as described in Supplementary
Methods. Cell lines were expanded as previously
described [30]. Every 2 months, cells were plated from a
frozen vial of the original batch but were not authenticated
by the authors. Interspecies contamination was tested by
PCR routinely.

In vitro cytotoxicity assays
PANC-1, PANC-1-Luc, BxPC-3, BxPC-3-Luc
and Emyc-3 cells were transduced with AduPARTKT,
ICOVIR15 or ICOVIR15-TKT viruses, and cultured in
the presence or absence of GCV (10 mg/ml, Cymevene)
for 3 or 4 days. Cell viability was measured by an MTT
colorimetric assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).
ID50 values were estimated from dose-response curves
by standard non-linear regression, using an adapted Hill
Equation (Prism, version 5; GraphPad Software).
The TK/GCV bystander effect was measured
by determining the viability of a mixed cell population
composed of different percentages of TK+ (100 or
50%) and TK- (0 or 50%) cells, cultured for 3 days in
the presence of GCV (10 µg/ml, Cymevene; Roche).
The TK positive (TK+) cells were generated 24 h before
establishing the cocultures by transduction with the
recombinant adenovirus AdTK.

Adenovirus construction
Construction of AdCMVGFPLuc, AduPARLuc,
AdTK and ICOVIR-15 have been previously described
[3, 13, 16, 31, 32]. AdCMVGFPLuc and AduPARLuc
express the enhanced GFP gene under the control of
CMV promoter and the firefly luciferase gene under
the control of CMV or uPAR promoter, respectively.

saline intraductally. AduPARTKT group received 1011 vp
of AduPARTKT. Three days later, GCV treatment (100 mg/
Kg) was i.p administered for 6 days. Six weeks after virus
administration, animals were sacrificed and the pancreas/
tumor was removed (Fig. 2D). Pancreatic volume was
measured and calculated according to the following
formula: V(mm3) = a × b × c /2, where a = length, b=
width, c = height of pancreas.
To evaluate the antitumoral efficacy of ICOVIR15TKT, orthotopic PANC-1-Luc (n=8-10 per grup) and
BxPC-3-Luc (n=8-9 per grup) pancreatic tumors were
established. When tumors reached 106-107 photons/s
measured by in vivo bioluminescence, which corresponds
to approximately 100 mm3, animals were randomly
divided into saline, ICOVIR-15, ICOVIR15-TKT
and ICOVIR15-TKT+GCV, and were intraductally or
intravenously injected with 5x1010 vp of the corresponding
adenovirus. Three days later GCV (100 mg/Kg) treatment
was initiated, according to the protocol described in
Fig.3D. Tumor growth was monitored by bioluminescence
analysis. Survival studies were performed and animals
were sacrificed according to ethical guidelines.

Animal procedures met the guidelines of European
Community Directive 86/609/EEC and were approved
by the Local Ethical Committee. Transgenic Ela-myc
and wt C57Bl6 mice of 11-17 weeks of age were used.
Male athymic nu/nu mice (6-8 weeks old, Harlan Iberica)
were used to generate orthotopic pancreatic tumors. Elamyc mice were genotyped by multiplex PCR analysis as
described in Supplementary Methods. Transgenic mice
and wild type littermates were used in this study.
PANC-1-Luc and BxPC-3-Luc orthotopic tumors
were generated by injecting 5x105 cells into the pancreas
of athymic nude mice, in a final volume of 50 µl, as
previously described [29].

Intraductal injection
Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of
isofluorane and oxygen, and a mixture of buprenorphine
(0.1 mg/Kg) and meloxicam (2 mg/Kg) was used as
analgesic. A laparotomy of 2 cm was performed through
a midline abdominal incision. Then the duodenum was
exposed and the common bile duct was clamped close to
the liver. A 30G needle was inserted into the duct from the
duodenum through the ampulla of Vater, next the needle
was clamped and 50 µl of virus were slowly injected
(approximately 10 µl every 10 s). One minute later clamps
were removed and the wound on the ampulla was closed
with Histoacryl® (B.Braun). Abdominal muscle layer was
closed with interrupted suture and the overlying skin was
closed using Autoclips® (Stoelting Europe).

Immunohistochemistry
Paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues
and frozen tumor sections were prepared as previously
described [29]. Five-micrometer paraffin-embedded
sections were treated with 10 mM citrate buffer (pH
6.0) for antigen retrieval and incubated overnight at 4°C
with anti-luciferase (L0159, Sigma) or with anti-GFP
(A6455, Invitrogene) antibodies. Bound antibodies were
detected with LSAB+ system-HRP (K0679, Dako). Tissue
sections were counterstained with Harris’s hematoxylin
and mounted with EUKITT® (Sigma-Aldrich). Images
were captured with a microscope (Leica DM6000 B) and
digital camera (Leica DFC300 FX; Leica Microsystems)
and processed with Leica Application Suite software.
Immunofluorescence was performed in OCT-embedded
sections by incubating with anti-adenovirus E1A (clone
sc-430, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Alexa Fluor 488 goat
anti-rat antibody (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies™)
was used as a secondary antibody. Nucleus were
counterstained with 5 µg/ml bis-benzimide (Hoechst
33342; Sigma) and visualized under a fluorescent
microscope (Observer/Z1; Zeiss). The fluorescent images
were captured using a digital camera (AxioCamMRm;
Zeiss).

Bioluminescence assay and quantification of
luciferase expression
In vivo and ex vivo luciferase activity was visualized
and quantified using an in vivo bioluminescent system
(IVIS50; Xenogen; Caliper Life Sciences) and Living
Image 2.20.1 Software overlay on Igor Pro4.06A software
(Wavematrics) as previously described [35]. Luciferase
transgene expression in tissue extracts was quantified
using the reporter Luciferase Assay System (Promega) as
previously described [13].

Antitumoral efficacy
To evaluate the antitumoral capacity of
AduPARTKT/GCV therapy, Ela-myc mice of 11 weeks of
age were randomly divided in PBS (n=9), GCV (n=11),
AduPARTKT (n=9), AduPARTKTHigh+GCV (n=9) and
AduPARTKTLow+GCV (n=7) groups and were intraductally
injected with 5x1010 vp or 1011 vp of AduPARTKT (Low
and High, respectively). PBS and GCV groups received

Pancreas toxicity study
Untreated 11-week-old Ela-myc mice or treated
by intraductal injections of AduPARTKT (5x1010 vp)
followed by six doses of GCV (daily dose of 100 mg/Kg)
were used for toxicology. Blood samples were collected

Results are expressed as mean ± SEM of at least
three independent experiments. Statistical differences
were determined using Prism (version 5; GraphPad
software) and were considered significant for P values
less than 0.05. A Mann-Whitney nonparametric test
was used for the statistical analysis (2-tailed) of in vitro
studies. Regular two-way ANOVA was used to compare
differences between the TK/GCV bystander effect in
tumoral cell lines. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used
to compare time-dependent differences among groups
(pancreas toxicity study and ICOVIR15-TK tumor growth
curves). Kruskal-Wallis test with Mann-Whitney U test
for post hoc analyses was used to compare differences
among AduPARTKT treatment groups. Survival studies
were performed to analyze time-to-event probability.
The survival curves (Kaplan-Meier curves) obtained
were compared for the different treatments. Animals that
were alive at the end of the experiment were included as
right censored information. A log-rank test was used to
determine the statistical significance of the differences in
time-to-event.
