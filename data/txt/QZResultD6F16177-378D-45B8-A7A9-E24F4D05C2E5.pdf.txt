ABSTRACT
Previous studies have associated the overexpression of histone deacetylase
2 (HDAC2) and the presence of TP53 mutations with the progression to advanced
stage drug resistant colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanistic link between
HDAC2 expression and the TP53 mutational status has remained unexplored. Here,
we investigated the function of HDAC2 in drug resistance by assessing the synergistic
effects of DNA-targeted chemotherapeutic agents and HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) on two
TP53-mutated colorectal adenocarcinoma CRC cell lines (SW480 and HT-29) and on the
TP53-wild type carcinoma cell line (HCT116 p53+/+) and its TP53 deficient sub-line
(HCT116 p53-/-). We showed that in the untreated SW480 and HT-29 cells the steadystate level of HDAC2 was low compared to a TP53-wild type carcinoma cell line (HCT116
p53+/+). Increased expression of HDAC2 correlated with drug resistance, and depletion
by shRNA sensitised the multi-drug resistance cell line HT-29 to CRC chemotherapeutic
drugs such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (Oxa). Combined treatment with the
HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid plus 5-FU or Oxa reduced the level of HDAC2
expression, modified chromatin structure and induced mitotic cell death in HT-29 cells.
Non-invasive bioluminescence imaging revealed significant reductions in xenograft
tumour growth with HDAC2 expression level reduced to <50% in treated animals.
Elevated levels of histone acetylation on residues H3K9, H4K12 and H4K16 were also
found to be associated with resistance to VPA/Dox or SAHA/Dox treatment. Our results
suggest that HDAC2 expression rather than the p53 mutation status influences the
outcome of combined treatment with a HDACi and DNA-damaging agents in CRC.

damaging agents in many cancer types, possibly through
the activation of non-histone proteins required for DNA
stability and higher-order chromatin organisation [4].
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common
gastrointestinal malignancy and the second most common
cause of cancer-related deaths in the Western world
[5]. Patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) have poor
prognosis [6] and both adjuvant and standard cancer
therapies remain sub-optimal in a significant number
of cases due to treatment resistance [7]. Genetic and
epigenetic alterations are evident in CRC initiation,
progression and in resistance to conventional drugs [7,
8]. The tumour suppressor gene TP53 is often inactivated
by loss of function mutations in CRC [9], although other
genetic (APC and RAS) or epigenetic alterations (e.g. DNA
methylation promoter silencing) may compromise TP53
response to DNA damage [10].
Aberrant expression patterns of HDAC2 are found
in a number of cancers including CRC [11]. Overexpression of HDAC2 occurs early at the premalignant
polyp stage of CRC [12] and correlates with a poor
prognosis in advanced stage disease [13]. The presence of
HDAC2 frame shift mutation in cancers from individuals
with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome
caused a loss of HDAC2 protein expression and enzymatic
activity and rendered tumour cells more resistant to
trichostatin A, a pan-HDACi [14].
The relationship between the mutational status of
P53 and HDAC2 overexpression is not well understood
in CRC drug response and the underlying molecular
mechanisms of HDACis remain poorly explored [15].
HDACis are effective therapeutic anticancer agents
via multiple mechanisms, which make them very
attractive agents not only for monotherapy but also for
combination therapy with other anticancer modalities.
HDACis can modulate cellular responses to DNA
damaging agents including ionising and ultraviolet
radiation, and chemotherapeutic drugs [16]. Many
HDACi / DNA damaging agent combination strategies
are both effective and synergistic whereas others are
ineffective or antagonistic with unclear mechanistic
reasons for these effects [17]. Hence, understanding
the mechanisms of HDACi resistance is crucial to
develop more effective combination strategies for the
future [18].
The aim of our study was to investigate the role
of HDAC2 in drug resistance and to assess its impact on
CRC cell lines with varied TP53 mutation states, (wildtype, null and mutated) in response to the combined
treatment with DNA-targeted chemotherapeutics agents
and HDACis. Our results suggest that HDAC2 expression
rather than the p53 mutation status influences the outcome
of combined treatment with a HDAC inhibitor and DNAdamaging agents in CRC. Furthermore, elevated levels
of histone acetylation were found to be associated with

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drug resistance in our cellular models. This is particularly
significant as we show that HDAC2 expression is
increased in moderately differentiated human metastatic
colorectal carcinomas in the liver compared with
normal tissues. Taken together, our results demonstrate
the potential of using HDAC2 expression levels as a
biomarker in understanding the effectiveness of combined
treatment.

RESULTS
The response of wild type, null, and mutated
TP53 CRC cell lines to DNA damaging agents
Mutations in TP53 tumour suppressor gene
are well-known events, which take place in the most
aggressive cancers. However, the significance of
mutated TP53 in drug resistance is controversial in many
cancers. In this study, we investigated the role of p53
in the induction of CRC cell death by DNA damaging
agents in the presence or absence of wild-type p53.
The wild type (WT) TP53 cell line HCT116 (HCT116
p53+/+) was treated with increasing concentrations
(0.1-3 μM) of the DNA damaging agent doxorubicin
(Dox), a topoisomerase II inhibitor. Incubation of
HCT116 p53+/+ cells with 0.5μM Dox was sufficient
to phosphorylate multiple p53 serine residues
(Ser15, Ser37, and Ser20). These post-translational
modifications (PTM) led to p53 accumulation in cells
(Figure 1A). Dox was able to induce apoptosis in
concentration-dependent manner as shown by PARP
cleavage (PARPc) (Figure 1A). Acetylation of p53
at residue K382 as contributor of its activation was
observed after exposure to 1-3μM Dox followed by
substantial increase of PARPc (Figure 1A). Therefore,
we sought to determine the role of p53 in controlling
the sensitivity to Dox. The TP53 WT (HCT116 p53+/+)
and null isogenic TP53 (HCT116 p53-/-) cell lines
were treated with 1μM Dox and assessed for PARPc
by immunoblotting (Figure 1B). HCT116 p53-/- cells
were less sensitive to 1μM Dox treatment and showed
less cell death in comparison with HCT116 p53+/+
suggesting that in absence of p53, the cells were less
sensitive to Dox treatment compared to HCT116 p53+/+
cells (Figure 1A and 1B). To confirm the importance of
the TP53 gene in regulating DNA damage responses,
SW480 and HT29 cells with TP53 mutations were used.
SW480 has two mutations in TP53: one is similar to that
in HT-29 (mutation in TP53 DNA-binding site, codon
273; and the second is located in the P53 oligomerisation
domain, codon 309). The Dox sensitivity of the two
mutated cell lines were compared to HCT116 p53+/+
and HCT116 p53-/- cell lines. HT-29 cells were treated
with 0.5 μM, 1μM and 2 μM Dox which all failed to
induce PARPc (Figure 1C). Surprisingly, PARPc

cells

was observed in SW480 treated with much lower 0.5
μM and 1μM concentrations of Dox (Figure 1C and
1D). To determine if the difference in sensitivity was
Dox specific, additional drugs were tested including
cisplatin and camptothecin, and also 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and Oxaliplatin (Oxa) both of which are first-line
chemotherapeutic agents used to treat patients with
Dukes’ B and C CRC. Low and high concentrations were
selected for each drug treatment. As HT-29 exhibited
more resistance to Dox compared to the other cell lines,
only the high concentrations of selected drugs were
used. HT-29 cells exhibited extreme resistance to all
drugs tested compared to the other cell lines, HCT116
p53+/+ and HCT116 p53-/-, as demonstrated by PARPc
(hallmark of apoptosis) (Figure 1E and 1F).

To characterise whether HDACis work
synergistically in combination with DNA damaging
agents; three HDAC inhibitors were used,
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA or vorinostat),
as an example of a pan HDACi active against class I
and class II HDACs; the short-chain fatty acid sodium
butyrate (NaB) and valproic acid (VPA), a class I
and class IIa HDAC inhibitor. To determine whether
any synergistic effects, low concentrations of DNA
damaging agents were selected and combined with the

by βactin and normalized uncleaved PARP. (Fold changes are the average of three independent of three independent experiments (n=3)).

and this supports the results western blot for these treatments (no PARPc). In all the western blotting experiments βactin was used as a

HDACis. HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53-/- were
treated with a single treatment of Dox (0.5μM) and
Camptothecin-11 (CPT-11) (5μM) or combined with
VPA (1 mM), SAHA (0.5μM), and NaB (1 mM) for 24
h and then analysed for cell death by flow cytometry.
Significant cell death was observed following SAHA
and NaB as a single treatment in HCT116 p53+/+ but
only a slight increase in HCT116 p53-/- (Figure 2A).
The combined treatments in HCT116 p53+/+ induced
a synergistic effect on cell death in comparison with
the single treatment, whereas HCT116 p53-/- showed
a synergistic effect only with Dox/SAHA (Figure 2A).
However, in HCT116 p53-/- cells an antagonistic effect
on cell death was observed with the Dox/VPA and CPT/
NaB combinations. Antagonistic effects on HT-29 cell
death were observed with Dox at 0.5 μM and 2 μM
combined with SAHA and CPT/SAHA (Figure 2B).
Interestingly, only the combined treatments, SAHA/5FU and SAHA/Oxa showed synergistic effects on HT-29
cell death (Figure 2B).

However, null p53, SW480 and HT-29 showed a marked
increase of HDAC2 following single or combined
treatments, which correlated with resistance to the
treatment (Figure 3C and 3D).
HDAC2 mRNA levels were also affected by the
drugs treatments. In HCT 116 p53+/+ cells, HDAC2
mRNA was reduced significantly (P < 0.001) following
Dox or VPA as single treatment or combined. In contrast
HT-29 cells exhibited a significantly increased HDAC2
mRNA expression (P < 0.001) upon the combined
treatment Dox/VPA (Figure 3E).
At the 24 hour time point, responses to the applied
treatments were classified in terms of sensitivity along the
following scale: HCT116 p53+/+ was the most sensitive,
then SW480, HCT116 p53-/-, and finally HT-29 (Figure
4A). HDAC2 expression levels increased significantly
(P<0.001) with treatment, which correlated with drug
resistance (Figure 4A-4B). As HDAC1 and HDAC2 could
play compensatory functions in regulating apoptosis, we
tested HDAC1 expression level. Our data showed no clear
correlation of HDAC1 with cell death in any cell lines
(Figure 4A).
To substantiate the importance of HDAC2 in CRC
drug resistance, exogenous WT P53 was transfected
into HT-29 cells and into HT-29-ShRNA-HDAC2
cells followed by Oxa treatment (Figure 4C). Notably,
the introduction of WT P53 did not induce cell death
following treatment as examined by the apoptotic endpoint of PARP cleavage. Combined treatments were also
investigated through the use of Oxa/SAHA in both HT29
and HT-29-ShRNA-HDAC2 cell lines and UV was used as
a positive control. Cell death analysis via flow cytometry
showed that exogenous WT P53 alone did not sensitise
HT-29 to Oxa treatment, rather WT p53 in combination
with shRNA-mediated HDAC2 induced treatment
sensitivity (Figure 4C and 4D).
Functional p53 is crucial for cancer chemosensitivity
and associated mutations lead to drug resistance and
shorter patient survival in different cancers. Thus, we
investigated the significance of p53 mutations in response
to the DNA damaging agent Dox. Several stable cell lines
with crucial p53 mutations were generated using both null
P53 HCT 116 and HT-29 cells. All generated p53 mutants’
cells were treated with 0.5μM Dox and cell death was
measured by PI staining and flow cytometry analysis.
Our data showed that TP53 WT P53 does not sensitise
HT-29 to Dox. Surprisingly, mutations (S15A, K120R,
K373R and K381R; Figure 5A-5C) were able to sensitise
significantly HT-29 cells to Dox (P<0.001).
However, HDAC2 depletion was sufficient to
sensitize HCT116 p53-/- cells to Dox and induce cell
death (P<0.001) (Figure 6A). Furthermore, transient
HDAC2 over-expression in both drug sensitive cell lines
HCT 116 p53+/+ (Figure 6B) and mutated TP53 SW480
cells (Figure 6C) increased the resistance against single
and combined treatments significantly (P<0.001).

HDAC2 expression after drug treatment with
DNA damaging agents singly or combined with
HDACis
HDAC2 overexpression and p53 mutations are
significantly associated with advanced stages and
poor prognosis in CRC patients [13]. However, the
relationship between HDAC2 and p53 status is not
completely understood nor the role and regulation
of HDAC2 expression level upon drug treatments.
Therefore, we investigated the relationship between
HDAC2 expression level and the effect of DNA
damaging agents as single treatments or combined with
HDACis in CRC cells lines. Cells were exposed for 24
h to increasing concentrations of Dox, Oxa and 5-FU
followed by the assessment of HDAC2 and PARPc
protein level by immunoblotting. We observed a dosedependent decrease in HDAC2 protein expression
(P<0.001), which was inversely proportional to PARPc
increase in HCT116 P53+/+ cells (Figure 3A and 3B).
In contrast, upon exposure to different concentrations of
the drugs, HT-29 cells exhibited extreme resistance to
PARPc induction and a significant increase in HDAC2
protein expression (P<0.001) (Figure 3A and 3B).
The effect of combined treatment on HDAC2
protein levels was investigated in the four CRC cell
lines with different TP53 mutational status: HCT116
p53+/+, HCT116 p53 -/-, SW480, and HT-29. All cell
lines were treated for 6 and 24 hours with the different
combinations of the drugs. At 6 hours, the p53+/+ cell
line exhibited sensitivity to the VPA/Dox and SAHA/
Dox combinations, but not to the single treatment as
measured by PARPc (Figure 3C). In HCT116 p53+/+
cell death correlated with a significant decrease in
HDAC2 expression (P<0.001) (Figure 3C and 3D).

significant response to cell death when 5-FU or Oxa
was combined with SAHA. Surprisingly, no PARPc was

by phosphorylated histone 3 (a mitotic cell marker)
(Figure 7A-7C), Interestingly no cell cycle arrest was
observed (data not shown).
To investigate the role of HDAC2 in MCD, shRNAmediated knockdown of HDAC2 was achieved in HT-29
cells. These were then treated with 5-FU, Oxa and SAHA
and compared to their parental cells following measurement
of both PARPc and MCD (Figure 7D and 7E). HDAC2
knockdown was sufficient to sensitise HT-29 cells to

5-FU or Oxa treatment and only the combined treatments
were able to reduce HDAC2 expression as detected by
immunohistochemistry similar to HDAC2 knockdown
effect (Figure 7F). We noticed that the combined treatment
Oxa/SAHA induced chromatin relaxation as assessed by
micrococcal nuclease (MNase) assay (Figure 7G). Oxa
combined with shRNA-HDAC2 disturbed the higher
order chromatin structure in a similar manner to the Oxa
combination with SAHA (Figure 7F, Zeta Stack).

Doxorubicin combined with SAHA or VPA
triggers a decrease in histone acetylation

(1μM) induced significant cell death in HCT116 p53+/+,
SW480, HCT116 p53-/- and with no effect on HT-29.
Therefore, the effect of combined treatment on histone
acetylation was compared using this concentration.
Interestingly, Dox combined with SAHA or VPA
triggered a decrease in histone acetylation in the poorly
differentiated and sensitive CRC cells, but not in the
resistant and well-differentiated HT-29 cells. In HT29 cells, the H3K9ac, H4K12ac and H4K16ac levels
remained high after the combined treatments compared
to the other cell lines (Figure 10).

To determine if there was a correlation between
histone acetylation and the sensitivity of CRC cell
lines to combined treatment. The levels of histone
acetylation in HCT116 p53+/+, HCT116 p53-/- (poorly
differentiated) and SW480 (poorly differentiated and

cell line HT-29. All cell lines were exposed to Dox,
VPA, and SAHA as a single or combined treatment
and the changes in histone acetylation established. Dox

The combined treatment effect was compared with the
single treatment alone. All combined treatments tested
were found to exert a synergistic effect on cell death in
CRC WT p53 cells, whereas cell death induced in null p53
cells shifted from synergistic with Dox/SAHA and CPT/
SAHA combinations to antagonistic with Dox/VPA and

We have shown that reduction in HDAC2
expression level plays an essential role in CRC response to
DNA damaging agents alone or combined with HDACis.
We demonstrated that mutated TP53 HT-29 cells exhibit
extreme resistance to drugs, whilst mutated TP53 SW480

CPT/NaB combinations. These results point to a limited
role for TP53 in response to Dox/SAHA combination
therapy since Dox/SAHA exerted a synergistic effect on
cell death in wild type and null p53 cells. In addition,
reconstitution of p53 protein in HCT 116 p53-/- and HT29 cells was not able to increase their sensitivity to drug
treatment and, surprisingly, mutated p53 (S15A, K120R,
K373R and K381R) sensitised null p53 or HT-29 to Dox.
Reintroducing WTp53 into drug-resistant CRC
mutated P53 HT-29 cells does not sensitise cells to
conventional CRC treatments Oxa and 5-FU. WTp53
overexpression is considered as a pro-apoptotic protein
and several studies showed this is possible when the
WTp53 is introduced in functional p53 cancer cells.
However, it is not always the case when cancer cells
have non functional P53 [20–22], which suggests
that the function of mutant P53 could not be rescued
when exogenous WTp53 is introduced. Another study
demonstrated that the p53 protein expressed in H1299
with no endogenous p53 cells does not seem to function
as normal WTp53 despite the fact that DNA damaging
agents allow the protein to stabilise and accumulate in the
cell [20]. Hence, H1299 cell may have switched to other
mechanisms for dealing with DNA damage, since there
is no p53 protein expression in H1299 [20]. Therefore,
the reconstitution of WTp53 alone is not sufficient to
substantially alter the sensitivity of cancer cells to a
given chemotherapeutic agent [20–22]. Thus, for the drug
regimens used here, TP53 mutational status may be of less
significance in CRC drug resistance.
Previous studies have reported variation in cancer
cell death among cells with differing p53 mutational status
[22]. For example cells with WT p53, are able to activate
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protect
cancer cells from autophagy to counteract the cytotoxicity
caused by the DNA-damaging agent. Conversely, nonfunctional p53 (mutated) is unable to activate AMPK and
cause autophagic cell death [23]. Additionally, PARPc is
involved in the molecular mechanisms of various forms of
cell death (including apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy)
[24]. The appearance of PARPc in the Dox treated mutated
cells could cause a similar cell death pathway.
In WT p53, null p53 and mutated p53 (SW480) cell
lines treated with SAHA or VPA combined with Dox, a
significant decrease in the expression level of HDAC2
is observed when apoptosis is induced, as shown by
PARPc or propidium iodide uptake. On the contrary,
treatment with the same combinations, MT p53 (HT29) cell line showed an increase in HDAC2 protein
expression with resistance to cell death. Furthermore,
HDAC2 overexpression in MT p53 SW480 cells confers
resistance to the combined treatment. This suggests that
TP53 mutations in CRC do not confer as much protection
against the effect of SAHA or VPA combined with Dox
as one would expect, rather it is the HDAC2 protein
levels that appear to confer a protective phenotype. Like
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HDAC2 expression, HDAC1 also seems to be upregulated
in CRC [25]. Whilst HDAC2 expression level increased
significantly with resistance to treatment, HDAC1
expression had no clear correlation across all cell lines.
We also established an in vivo model to verify HDAC2
expression levels and to evaluate the response to combined
treatments. Liposomal-encapsulated Dox/SAHA was used
to treat human CRC xenografts mice as an innovative
delivery strategy for toxicity reduction. We found that
the combined treatment induced a proportional and
significant decrease in HDAC2 expression level, which
were associated with tumour shrinkage as measured by
tumour size and luciferase activity. Similarly, combined
treatment led to a reduction in tumours from both WT p53
and a null p53 cells, again suggesting that p53 is a poor
prognostic marker compared to HDAC2 expression.
Deletion of HDAC2 without drug treatment is not
sufficient to induce cell death [26]. Here we show that,
although HDAC2 depletion is not sufficient for cell death
it leads to perturbations in the higher order chromatin
structure similar to the effects of HDACis and increased
HT-29 sensitivity to 5-FU and Oxa leading to MCD.
Whilst the mechanism of HDAC2 inactivation and druginduced cell death remains largely unknown, recent
microarray analysis of HDAC2 inactivation in human
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) identified a large number
of mitotic gene elements including the up-regulation
of cell cycle inhibitors and down-regulation of cyclin
target genes [27]. The increase of HDAC2 expression
has been found in CRC patients at mRNA and protein
level indicating that HDAC2 overexpression is due to
transcriptional activation [11]. This overexpression of
HDAC2 appears to be implicated in cancer through its
aberrant recruitment to promoter of tumour suppressor
genes leading to gene silencing [28]. HDAC2 transcription
is regulated by β-catenin-TCF signalling pathway that is
deregulated in CRC. Histone acetyltransferase p300/
CREB-binding protein (CBP) is a crucial coactivator for
β-catenin-TCF-mediated survivin transcription [28] and
the complex regulation of survivin transcription involves
enhancement by β-catenin and repression by p53 [29]. As
the relationship between survivin and HDAC2 has not
been explored in the combinatorial treatment of CRC we
investigated this in mice xenograft tumours. Treatment
with SAHA/Dox gave a significant reduction in protein
expression for both HDAC2 and survivin. Also, we found
increased levels of HDAC2 and survivin expression in
human CRC metastatic liver tissues.
Compact chromatin is crucial for the protection
against agents causing DNA breaks and oxidative DNA
damage and this protection is reduced following chromatin
relaxation [30]. Using a chromatin relaxation assay, we
demonstrated that mutated p53 HT-29 cell line showed
relaxed chromatin only after combined Oxa/SAHA
treatment. This supports our previous finding, where in
the absence of functional p53, SIRT1 (HDAC class III)

conventional CRC drugs.

expression level is a critical parameter in trichostatin A
or VPA-mediated sensitisation of several multidrugresistant cancer cells to the topoisomerase II inhibitor
etoposide [2]. HDACis allow for increased histone
acetylation and the subsequent chromatin relaxation that
occurs may render DNA more susceptible to a number of
DNA-damaging agents [31] and increase the binding of
transcription factors that regulate genes involved in cell
death. Interestingly, it has been suggested that p53 has the
biochemical potential for promoting chromatin relaxation,
since it can recruit the histone acetyltransferase (HAT)
p300 to chromatin. This could facilitate histone acetylation
[32] and hence induce chromatin accessibility to enable
the efficient detection of lesions [33–35].
Recent studies have shown that the acetylation of
H3 or H4 is decreased in poorly differentiated cancer
cells while the global expression in moderate to well
differentiated cancer cells is increased [36]. However, it is
unclear whether such differences in steady state acetylation
levels could be indicative of resistance to drugs used
singly or combined with HDACis. With this perspective
in mind, we demonstrated that Dox combined with SAHA
or VPA triggers a decrease in histone acetylation in
poorly differentiated and sensitive CRC cells, including
SW480 cells, but not in well-differentiated and resistant
HT-29 cells. Therefore, in HT-29 the H3K9ac, H4K12ac
and H4K16ac levels remain elevated after the combined
treatments compared to the other cells. Our results are in
agreement with the elevated level of lysine 9-acetylated
histone H3 that occurs at the multi-resistance protein
1 (MDR1) promoter in multidrug-resistant cells [37].
Therefore, the association of histone acetylation levels
with CRC resistance is of particular importance if the level
of acetylation predicts combinatorial therapy outcomes.
The level of histone acetylation, however appears to be
independent of the deacetylating role of HDAC2 and
possibly HDAC2 expression represses transcription
factors activation which controls cancer cell death and
promotes drug resistance.
It is highly likely that the overall response to
conventional treatment may be less robust in patients
that strongly express HDAC2 in their cancer cells.
Hence, HDAC2 expression in a given tumour might
be of prognostic value and also predict the response to
combinatorial (HDACis/drug) therapy. Identification of
HDAC2 expression as a sensitive “epigenetic biomarker”
associated with HDACis/DNA damaging agent’s
resistance may also lead to a new molecular target for
CRC therapy and could help to improve treatment of the
disease and provide a more robust mechanistic rationale
for the use of HDACis. Further work could present an
opportunity to maximise treatment efficacy by pharmacoepigenetic selection of CRC patients treated with HDAC
inhibitors combined with DNA-damaging therapies.

Preparation of liposomes

Generation of stable cell lines

Liposomes for in vivo therapeutic application were
prepared in organic solvent of N1-cholesteryloxycarbonyl3,7-diazanonane-1,9-diamine (CDAN), 1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), cholesterol and
1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-Nmethoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000 (DSPE-PEG2000)
using a spontaneous vesicle formation procedure (19).
The solvent was then removed in vacuo to ensure
production of an even lipid. The film was re-hydrated
and remotely loaded with either 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (4 mM, NaCl
135 mM, pH 6.5) or with Doxorubicin and SAHA. The
total lipid concentration in the suspension was 2.88 mg/
mL. The concentration of doxorubicin and SAHA was
selected to approximate a 20g/ mouse receiving liposomal
doxorubicin at a dosage of 10 mg/kg and a liposomal
dosage of SAHA to be 50 mg/kg. The thin- film of
nanoparticle liposome was obtained by hydration and by
sonication method for 1hour at 30°C, in order to form the
required uniform PEGylated liposome, and buffered to
a pH of 7.0. The liposomal solution was dialyzed for 18
hours using the Float-A-Lyzer G2 device (Fisher scientific,
UK) to remove any un-encapsulated materials (19). The
particles had a component molar ratio of 32/24/8/30
(CDAN/DOPC/DSPE-PEG
PEG2000/cholesterol).
Particle size and zeta potential were determined using

Stable cell lines were generated after transfection of
p53-null HCT 116 P53-/- or HT-29 cells with wild type
P53 plasmid (Origene, UK) or mutant p53 expression
plasmids generated by using the QuikChange II sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the
manufacturer. The mutated plasmid were sequenced and
verified by using NCB Blast: Nucleotide Sequence. After
transfection, the cells that incorporate the plasmids were
selected by grown them in medium containing 2.5 μg/ml
of puromycin for 2 weeks. The resulting colonies were
then pooled and used for further assays than used for
experiments.

MNase sensitivity assay
Cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (ce-cold NP40 lysis buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 10 mM NaCl, 3
mM MgCl2, 0.5% NP-40, 0.15 mM spermine, 0.5 mM
spermidine) and incubated on ice for 5 minutes.). Nuclei
were resuspended in Micrococal nuclease (MNase)
digestion buffer(10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM CaCl2).
A total of 0.06 units of MNase (Sigma-Aldrich, UK)
was added to each sample and incubated at 15-20°C for
5 minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of
MNase digestion buffer, MNase stop buffer ((0.5 ml) 5% SDS; 250 mM EDTA), proteinase K and 20% SDS
followed by overnight incubation. DNA was extracted
by standard phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol
precipitation.

callipers. The volume estimated was measured assuming
an ellipsoid shape using the following equation:
Volume= length x width x depth x π/6. Animals
were sacrificed and the tumours were carefully excised
to minimize any surrounding normal tissue. Tumors were
weighed, portioned and placed in phosphate-buffered
