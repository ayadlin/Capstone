ABSTRACT
EGFR, HER2, and HER3 contribute to the initiation and progression of human
cancers, and are therapeutic targets for monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase
inhibitors. An important source of resistance to these agents arises from functional
redundancy among EGFR, HER2, and HER3. EGFR family members contain conserved
extracellular structures that are stabilized by disulfide bonds. Compounds that disrupt
extracellular disulfide bonds could inactivate EGFR, HER2, and HER3 in unison. Here we
describe the identification of compounds that kill breast cancer cells that overexpress
EGFR or HER2. Cell death parallels downregulation of EGFR, HER2, and HER3. These
compounds disrupt disulfide bonds and are termed Disulfide Bond Disrupting Agents
(DDAs). DDA RBF3 exhibits anticancer efficacy in vivo at 40 mg/kg without evidence
of toxicity. DDAs may complement existing EGFR-, HER2-, and HER3-targeted agents
that function through alternate mechanisms of action, and combination regimens with
these existing drugs may overcome therapeutic resistance.

(Herceptin) and Pertuzumab, and HER2/EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors such as Lapatinib, has revolutionized the
treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Unfortunately,
66–88% of HER2-positive tumors exhibit primary
resistance to Trastuzumab as a monotherapy [5–7].
Further, standard Trastuzumab-centered regimens include
either a Taxane or an Anthracycline to provide acceptable
anti-cancer efficacy, but 15% of patients acquire resistance
to these combination therapies as well [8]. These regimens
are associated with significant side effects including
cardiotoxicity and anaphylaxis [9]. Clearly, additional
therapies are needed to reduce the toxicity of these
combination therapies and to overcome drug resistance.
A large number of resistance mechanisms to
Trastuzumab and Lapatinib have been described (reviewed
in [10–13]). Many of these mechanisms involve the ability
of these three proteins to function in a partially redundant
manner. For example when Trastuzumab inactivates

INTRODUCTION
The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
family members EGFR, Human Epidermal growth factor
Receptor-2 (HER2), and Human Epidermal growth factor
Receptor-3 (HER3) are well established as proto-oncogenes
that play key roles in the initiation and progression of human
cancers (reviewed in [1–3]). EGFR is frequently mutationally
activated in lung cancer and is the target of the FDAapproved drugs Cetuximab, Panitumumab, and Erlotinib.
Although EGFR is rarely mutated in breast cancers, the wild
type protein is frequently overexpressed in breast tumors,
and EGFR has been suggested to be a therapeutic target in
triple-negative (Estrogen Receptor-, Progesterone Receptor-,
and HER2-negative) breast cancers [4].
HER2 overexpression in breast cancer is
associated with poor prognosis, but the production
of HER2-targeted antibodies such as Trastuzumab

conformation. In the structure of the EGF (or TGFα)
ligand-bound, un-tethered, active conformation of the
EGFR extracellular domain, a homodimeric structure is
formed in which all of the contacts that maintain the dimer
involve the cysteine rich domain II of each monomer.
Thus, both the inactive and active conformations
are maintained by contacts involving cysteine rich
domains II and IV or domain II alone, respectively.
According to the data tabulated on the UniProt
website (http://www.uniprotorg/uniprot/P00533) EGFR
contains 25 intrachain disulfide bonds spanning distances
of from four to 30 amino acids in the primary sequence.
The loops generated by six pairs of these disulfide bonds
are overlapping (e.g. loops corresponding to amino
acids 190–199, 194–207; 215–223, 219–231; 232–240,
236–248; 506–515, 510–523; 558–571, 562–579;
620–628, 624–636). Given the intricate and extensive
network of disulfide bonding in these receptors that
is critical for their proper folding and function, we
hypothesized that compounds able to disrupt disulfide
bonds might preferentially inactivate HER-family receptor
tyrosine kinases and that this might explain the pattern of
cancer cell line responsiveness to these agents.

HER2, EGFR and HER3 can still heterodimerize and
drive mitogenic and survival signaling [14]. Likewise,
Pertuzumab blocks HER2 dimerization with EGFR or
HER3, but this does not preclude EGFR/HER3 dimerization
and signaling. Lapatinib blocks the kinase activity of
both HER2 and EGFR, but while HER3 has very little
intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity [15, 16], it can serve as a
substrate for c-Met and activate PI3K-dependent signaling
in the absence of EGFR and HER2 function [17–19].
Therefore, an improved agent for the treatment of
HER2-dependent breast cancer would inactivate EGFR,
HER2, and HER3 in parallel, be effective in the treatment
of cancer as a single agent, and be mechanistically
complementary with the HER2-targeted monoclonal
antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Herein we
describe the identification of a series of molecules that
fulfill these criteria.

RESULTS
Extracellular EGFR, HER2, and HER3 disulfide
bonds as a potential drug target
The anticancer effects of the Disulfide bond Disrupting
Agents (DDAs) were discovered serendipitously. Our initial
goal was to employ molecular docking and a homology
model of the CUB Domain-Containing Protein 1 (CDCP1)
to identify compounds that would modulate CDCP1 tyrosine
phosphorylation. During this screening, we noticed that
compound NSC624205 killed the MDA-MB-468 cells used
in the screen when administered at 20 μM for 24 h, while
none of the other structurally unrelated compounds tested
had this effect. Another cell line used in the initial screens,
the BxPC3 pancreatic cell line, was unaffected by the same
treatment. Therefore we were intrigued by the selective actions
of NSC624205 against MDA-MB-468 cells, but not BxPC3
cells, and endeavored to identify the underlying molecular
basis. NSC624205 (structure shown in Figure 4C) contains a
sulfinic acid moiety, and the sulfur atom in sulfinic acids can
act as a nucleophile with the potential to break disulfide bonds.
EGFR, HER2, and HER3 share evolutionarily
conserved extracellular domains stabilized by disulfide bonds
(Figure 1A) [20–23]. The HER family of receptors is unique
among receptor tyrosine kinases in having four extracellular
domains, two of which, domains II and IV are cysteine
rich (reviewed in [24]). The Insulin receptor subfamily
and the Ret tyrosine kinases each contain a single cysteine
rich repeat, while none of the remaining 16 subfamilies of
receptor tyrosine kinases have a cysteine rich domain.
Structural studies indicate a key role for the cysteine
rich repeats in the folding and activation of HER-family
receptors. In particular, the ligand-induced conformational
change of the extracellular domain of EGFR has been
studied extensively (reviewed in [25]). In the structure
of the ligand-free EGFR extracellular domain, cysteine
rich domain II forms contacts with cysteine rich domain
IV to maintain the receptor in the “tethered”, inactive

Sulfinate-containing compounds kill breast
cancer cells that overexpress EGFR or HER2
and block Akt phosphorylation
We obtained several sulfinate-containing compounds
from the National Cancer Institute’s Developmental
Therapeutics Program (NCI/DTP) and in a second screen
examined their ability to decrease the viability of various
human cancer cell lines. As expected, NSC624205 was
lethal to MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, but had little
effect on BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells, indicating that
NSC624205 is not a general cytotoxic agent (Figure 1B).
NSC624205 and two related compounds, NSC624203 and
NSC624204, decreased cell viability by 50% in the range
of 3.7–33 μM (Figure 1C). Over a period of 24 hr, 10 μM
NSC624205 killed MDA-MB-468 and SKBR3 cells,
which overexpress EGFR and HER2 respectively, but had
little effect on the basal-like/triple-negative MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cell line, which does not overexpress either
EGFR or HER2 (Figure 1D). Comparison of the ability
of NSC624203 to inhibit the proliferation of MDAMB-468 cells with that of a commercial EGFR/HER2
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Calbiochem, Cat. # 324673)
revealed that NSC624203 more effectively suppressed
the proliferation of both cell lines when used at the same
concentration (Figure 1E). Examination of the effects of
NSC624205 on cell signaling in a small panel of human
cancer cell lines demonstrated variable effects depending
on the cell line, inhibiting Akt phosphorylation in SKBR3
cells, and Erk phosphorylation in SKBR3, HCC1954,
and T47D cells (Figure 1F). Overall, cell killing by the
sulfinate compounds correlated most closely with loss of
Akt phosphorylation on Thr308.

Sulfinate compounds induce cell death that
correlates with EGFR dephosphorylation, PARP
cleavage, and reduced ligand-dependent EGFR
tyrosine phosphorylation

Structure/activity relationships among sulfinatecontaining compounds
We next screened a panel of sulfinate-containing
compounds that are structurally similar to NSC624203
and NSC624205 in order to identify more effective
compounds. Analysis of the effects of additional NSC
compounds on cell viability (Figure 4A) or EGFR
and Akt phosphorylation (Figure 4B) demonstrated
that NSC333839 has activity similar to NSC624205.
NSC606968 had a partial effect on EGFR electrophoretic
mobility, but only a weak effect on Akt phosphorylation.
An overall evaluation of these results indicated that all
active compounds possess a sulfinate group separated
from a disulfide bond by four carbons (Figure 4C, left,
boxed). Additional compounds, termed the RBF series,
were synthesized to determine whether compounds could
be produced that had enhanced activity over the NSC
compounds examined initially and to determine whether
the sulfinate moiety is required for compound activity. The
synthesis of RBF1 was achieved with some modifications
of the previously described procedure of Boldyrev and
Luzhetskaya [26]. The syntheses of DTDO, RBF2, and
RBF3 were previously described by Harpp, et al. [27]
and Field and colleagues [28, 29] and could be easily
reproduced with minor modifications. Barbee and Field
[30] reported the oxidation of a disulfinate to a disulfonate
species using H2O2. Optimization of the reaction time
using this oxidant allowed the successful preparation
of the disulfonates RBF4 and RBF6 from RBF1 and
RBF3, respectively. Oxidation of RBF2 to RBF5 led to
the desired compound (as observed by HRMS), however
the pure compound could not be separated from other byproducts. A summary of the compounds tested and their
activity against cancer cells is presented in Figure 4C. Of
the RBF series, RBF3 was the most effective and produced
a 50% decrease in the viability of MDA-MB-468 cells and
the HER2 overexpressing BT474 cells between 5–10 μM
(Figure 4D). RBF3 effects on cell proliferation were
observed as low as 2 μM, a concentration at which RBF3
had no effect on the proliferation of immortalized human
mammary epithelial cells (Figure 4E).
Examination of the biochemical effects of RBF3
on MDA-MB-468 (Figure 4F), SKBR3 (Figure 4G), and
BT474 (Figure 4H) cells revealed that RBF3 decreased
the levels of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 in parallel. Two
independent preparations of RBF3 (i.e., RBF3.1 and
RBF3.2) were more effective than NSC624203 at
downregulating EGFR and upregulating PARP cleavage
in side-by-side comparisons in MDA-MB-468 cells.
Therefore, RBF3 was considered to be the most promising
lead compound. In contrast to the high activity of RBF1
and RBF3, derivatives of these compounds in which the
sulfinate groups had been oxidized to sulfonate groups,
RBF4 and RBF6, did not downregulate EGFR, HER2,
or HER3 in MDA-MB-468 cells, did not increase

As mentioned above, we initially hypothesized that
sulfinate compounds may be useful in destabilizing EGFRfamily members; therefore, we examined the effects of
NSC624205 on the levels and phosphorylation of EGFR in
MDA-MB-468 cells. NSC624205 induced a concentrationdependent increase in EGFR electrophoretic mobility
that correlated with a decrease in EGFR phosphorylation
detected using a phospho-specific antibody (Figure 2A).
NSC624205 also caused a concentration-dependent
increase in PARP cleavage, consistent with the induction
of apoptosis (Figure 2B). To examine the reversibility of
NSC624205 actions, MDA-MB-468 cells were treated
for 24 hours with NSC624205 and then the compound
was washed out and the cells were allowed to recover for
various periods of time. This experiment revealed that at
24 hours post-treatment, EGFR electrophoretic mobility
was restored to near control levels, indicating that the
effects of this compound are slowly reversible (Figure 2C).
To examine whether NSC624205 can suppress cellular
responses to EGF, cells were stimulated with EGF in
the presence or absence of NSC624205. NSC624205
decreased both overall EGF-induced cellular tyrosine
phosphorylation and EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation
on Tyr845 (Figure 2D). Comparison of NSC624203 with
AG490 or an EGFR/HER2 kinase inhibitor (Calbiochem
#324673) showed that NSC624203 was more effective
at decreasing Akt phosphorylation, increasing PARP
cleavage and reducing EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation
and overall levels of cellular tyrosine phosphorylation
(Figure 2E). Interestingly, combining NSC624203 with
the EGFR/HER2 inhibitor blocked Erk phosphorylation
more effectively than either drug alone.

Overexpression of EGFR is sufficient to render
breast cancer cells responsive to sulfinate
compound-induced toxicity
T47D cells are not killed by NSC624205, therefore
we examined whether this is because these cells do
not overexpress EGFR. Interestingly, T47D cells with
enforced EGFR expression underwent cell death in
response to NSC624205, but vector control cells did not
(Figure 3A). As observed above, NSC624205-mediated
cell death correlated with an EGFR electrophoretic
mobility shift, and decreased Akt phosphorylation
(Figure 3B). Cell proliferation assays showed that
similarly, EGFR overexpressing T47D cells were more
sensitive to NSC624203 than the control cells (Figure 3C).
However, no difference between the two cell lines was
observed when proliferation was suppressed using PI3kinase inhibitor LY294002.

Proposed mechanism of action of sulfinate

agents (DDAs)

PARP cleavage, and did not reduce Akt phosphorylation
(Figure 4F). These observations indicate that the sulfinate
groups present in these compounds are essential for their
activity against cancer cells. Our interpretation of these
data is that oxidation of the sulfinate groups to sulfonate
causes loss of activity because unlike the sulfinate sulfur,
the sulfonate sulfur does not behave as a nucleophile and
therefore cannot disrupt the extracellular disulfide bonds
in EGFR, HER2, and HER3 and destabilize these proteins.

We hypothesize that RBF3 and the other
pharmacophore-containing compounds function through
the mechanism outlined in Figure 5A, in which the sulfinate
sulfur atom mounts a nucleophilic attack on a sulfur atom
in a disulfide bond. This would result in disruption of the

disulfide bond, the formation of a thiosulfonate group
connecting the disulfide bond disrupting agent (DDA) to
a Cysteine side chain, and would leave a free thiol group.
In a second reaction (pathways a and b), the disulfide bond
within the pharmacophore could react with a free thiol
on the protein. Either scenario will result in the insertion
of the DDA into a disulfide bond and alteration of the
disulfide bond connectivity in the protein, perhaps altering
the secondary structure of the protein. A final mechanistic
possibility invokes DTDO, a cyclic intermediate accessible
from DDAs with appropriate spacing between the sulfinate
and disulfide functions (vide infra). Reaction between
DTDO and a free thiol on the protein (pathway c) could
then disrupt the protein disulfide infrastructure through
(potentially transient) DTDO incorporation.
In support of this mechanistic hypothesis,
electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometric analysis
of reactions between RBF3, RBF6, or DTDO and
glutathione in both the oxidized (GSSG) and reduced
form (GSH) were performed in order to identify products
from the reaction of DDAs with a biological thiol or
disulfide (Figures 5B-E). Reaction of RBF3 with GSH
led to two product masses (m/z = 458 and m/z = 550)
from incorporation of structural segments of RBF3 to
glutathione (Figure 5B). While the precise structure
(i.e., with respect to X and Y in the figure) cannot be
assigned by ESI-MS, the result suggests that free thiols
can react with the disulfide bonds within the RBF3
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

structure. Although decomposition of RBF3 to DTDO
is possible [29], the formation of a product featuring
incorporation of both the pharmacophore and the two
carbon linker (m/z = 550, Figure 5B) suggests that the free
thiols present in solution can directly attack the disulfide
bonds of RBF3. Reaction of RBF3 with GSSG (Figure 5C)
led to the same ensemble of products observed for the
combination of RBF3 and GSH, indicating cleavage of the
disulfide bond in GSSG. In fact, formation of GSH was
observed when GSSG was exposed to RBF3 (Figure 5C).
This result is consistent with the hypothesis that the
nucleophilic sulfinate groups of RBF3 can attack disulfide
bonds, releasing a thiolate and incorporating RBF3
to a biomolecule. Formation of an ion with m/z = 489
was also observed and its exact mass agrees with the
structure assigned in Figure 5C. Its formation is possible
through the disruption of the disulfide bonds within the
RBF3 structure by the sulfinate groups. A control study
where a solution of RBF3 itself was exposed to the
same conditions led to the identification of the same ion,
indicating that this species is not produced from reactions
between RBF3 and glutathione. DTDO was also studied
in such reactions. As expected, reaction of DTDO with
GSH led to incorporation of the pharmacophore to
glutathione (m/z = 458, Figure 5D, akin to pathway c in
Figure 5A) while reaction with GSSG gave no reaction
(Supplemental Data, Figure S1). Reaction of RBF6 with
GSH (Figure 5E) led to the incorporation of segments

from BT474 cells (Figure 6A). In contrast, in vehicle
(water) treated animals the tumors grew rapidly. During
the treatment period the weights of the animals were
not significantly affected by drug treatment (Figure 6B).
Examination of the histology of the remnants of RBF3
treated tumors revealed that most of the tumor tissue was
necrotic or fibrotic, and that only a small fraction of these
tumors was composed of viable cancer cells (Figure 6C).
In separate experiments, we treated tumor-bearing mice
with RBF3 at dosages of up to 160 mg/kg/day. Under these
conditions, no evidence of toxicity was observed based
on histological examination of kidney and liver tissue
(Supplemental Data, Figure S1). In contrast, tumor tissues
from RBF3-treated animals exhibited a high frequency of
cancer cell death.

from RBF6 to glutathione (m/z = 474 and 566). On the
other hand, reaction of RBF6 with GSSG (Supplemental
Data, Figure S2) did not result in the formation of any
products. These results are consistent with the hypothesis
that the thiol group of GSH may attack the disulfide bonds
within the structure of the DDAs and suggests that the
nucleophilic sulfinate moiety is required to disrupt the
disulfide bonds within a biomolecule.
To summarize, the biochemical functions of RBF3
require two chemical moieties, the sulfinate group, which
may function as a nucleophile to break disulfide bonds,
and a disulfide bond that is susceptible to nucleophilic
attack. Further, this donor/acceptor combination must be
separated by four intervening carbon atoms, suggesting
that DTDO may function as an intermediate that is capable
of functioning as a target of thiolate nucleophilic attack.

DISCUSSION

DDAs exhibit anti-cancer activity in vivo without
evidence of toxicity

Conventional drugs that act on HER2, EGFR, and
HER3 include monoclonal antibodies or tyrosine kinase
inhibitors. DDAs represent a new way of inactivating
these oncogenes by protein downregulation. To our
knowledge this approach has not previously been taken
with receptor tyrosine kinases, but there is precedence for
related approaches for other drug targets. The breast cancer

Given the promising negative impact of RBF3 on the
viability of HER2 and EGFR overexpressing breast cancer
cell lines, we examined whether RBF3 had activity against
xenografts of human breast cancer. Strikingly, 40 mg/kg
RBF3 strongly suppressed the growth of tumors derived

drug Fulvestrant functions in part by downregulating the
Estrogen Receptor [31]. Further, we previously described
a new class of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK) inhibitors
that inhibit cell proliferation by inducing CDK aggregation
and degradation via aggresomes [32]. The mechanisms
by which DDAs downregulate EGFR family members
are currently under investigation, and could involve
proteasomal or lysosomal degradation, and aggresomes
or autophagosomes, respectively. The conserved
disulfide bonding pattern in the extracellular domains
of EGFR family members may provide an additional,
complementary approach for targeting these oncogenes.
The first DDAs that we investigated, NSC624203
and NSC624205, were originally designed as part of an
effort to produce compounds that were protective against
radiotoxicity [28, 33]. In these studies, these and similar
sulfur-rich compounds were administered to mice at very
high dosages before toxicity was observed.
Our results showing that activity against cancer
cells requires compounds with a sulfinate group attached
to a disulfide bond by four intervening carbon atoms
indicate that this pharmacophore has biological activity
distinct from radioprotection. The precise spacing required
between the disulfide and sulfinate groups, and the fact
that a sulfonate group cannot substitute for the sulfinate
group, suggest that the DDA pharmacophore may require
the formation of a cyclic intermediate for its activity.
Alternately, the requirement for precise spacing may result
from the distances between the repetitive disulfide bonded
structures in the extracellular domains of EGFR, HER2,
and HER3 (see Figure 1A).
This class of compounds has previously been
shown to react intramolecularly to form DTDO [29].
Thus, although a previous report suggested that RBF3
does not form significant amounts of DTDO in a 16 hour
period [29], it is possible that both reductive cleavage of
disulfide bonds by the sulfinate group and DTDO formation
contribute to the anticancer actions of RBF3. DTDO and
related compounds were previously shown to exhibit
activity against human immunodeficiency virus type I
through chemical modification of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid
zinc finger protein NCp7, resulting in ejection of the bound
zinc ligand from the protein [34]. DTDO formation might
likewise inactivate cellular zinc finger proteins or enzymes
with essential cysteine residues at their active sites.
It is clear however that the sulfinate group is
essential for the downregulation of EGFR, HER2, and
HER3 because DTDO does not downregulate these
proteins in cell culture. Further, DTDO can react with a
free thiol (e.g. GSH, Figure 5D), but is unable to react with
disulfide bonds in vitro (e.g. GSSG, Supplemental Data
Figure S2). The importance of DTDO formation in the
anticancer actions of RBF3 is currently being investigated.
It is possible that one of the reasons that RBF3 and
similar compounds have little observable toxicity is due
to the two charged sulfinic acid groups. This may render

these molecules poorly membrane permeable and restrict
their effects primarily to extracellular proteins and the
extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins, without
altering the activity of intracellular proteins. Further work
is required to optimize these agents with respect to their
absorption and stability in vivo.
In summary, DDAs show impressive anticancer
activity without obvious toxicity in mice. This class of
agents might be useful in the treatment of HER2- and
EGFR-dependent breast tumors and may be effective for
the treatment of cancers that have acquired resistance
to monoclonal antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors
targeting these enzymes. The DDA pharmacophore may
also find more widespread use in drug development
beyond the treatment of HER2- and EGFR-driven
human cancers. The presence of two sulfur–containing
moieties within the pharmacophore structure generates
a combined transiency of their oxidation states (sulfinate
to thiosulfonate and disulfide to thiol) that makes these
molecules interesting and unique. This intramolecular
chemical diversity may have broad applications in
medicinal chemistry.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Compound synthesis, purification, and analysis
General methods
Reagents and solvents were purchased from
commercial sources and used without further
purification unless otherwise specified. 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded using commercially-obtained
(Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) deuterated solvents
on Varian Inova-500 (1H at 500 MHz; 13C at 125 MHz)
or Mercury-300 (1H at 300 MHz; 13C at 75 MHz)
spectrometers. Chemical shifts (δ) are given in parts per
million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) and
referenced to residual protonated solvent (CDCl3: δ H
7.26 ppm, δ C 77.23 ppm; D2O: δ H 4.79 ppm). Coupling
constants are given in Hz. Spin multiplicities are presented
by the following symbols: s (singlet), bs (broad singlet),
d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), p (pentet), and m
(multiplet). Electrospray ionization (ESI) high resolution
mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on an Agilent 6200
ESI-TOF instrument operating in positive or negative ion
mode as stated, with methanol as the carrier solvent. NMR
spectra of synthesized compounds are shown in Figure S3.
1, 2-Dithiane-1, 1-dioxide (DTDO)
DTDO was prepared using a procedure reported by
Harpp, et al. with some modifications [27]. A solution of
1,4-butanedithiol (24.7 mmol, 2.90 mL) in AcOH (25 mL)
was cooled in an ice bath and a 30% aqueous H2O2 solution
(8.8 mL) was added slowly such that the temperature did
not rise above 35°C. After stirring for 18 h, the solvent
was removed under vacuum, and the residue was diluted

Optimization of reaction time for oxidation of RBF1
to sodium 4-({4-[(sodiooxy)sulfonyl]butyl}disulfanyl)
butane-1-sulfonate (RBF4)

with water (25 mL), neutralized with NaHCO3, and
extracted with toluene (4 × 50 mL). The organic extract
was dried with MgSO4, and the solvent was removed
under vacuum. The resulting solid was recrystallized three
times from Et2O to afford 1.55 g (10.2 mmol, 41% yield)
of the product as a white solid. mp 55–58°C (lit. [27] mp
54–56°C); 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ2.03 (2H, m),
2.37 (2H, m), 3.35 (4H, m) ppm; 13C NMR (CDCl3,
125 Hz): δ 25.1, 26.2, 35.2, 59.7 ppm.

To a solution of RBF1 (0.102 g, 0.292 mmol) in DI
water (4.3 mL) with stirring at rt, a solution of H2O2 (72
μL of a 30% aqueous H2O2 solution in 1.05 mL of DI
water) was added dropwise. After different reaction periods
(i.e., immediately after addition, 30 min, and 1, 2, 7, 24,
or 48 h), the water was evaporated under vacuum and the
resulting solid was analyzed by 1H NMR. The absence
of peaks related to the starting material and appearance
of peaks associated with the desired oxidation product in
every reaction period indicated fast conversion. Additional
peaks were observed after 2 hours and total degradation of
the desired product to an overoxidized species, butane-1,
4-disulfinate, was observed after 48 h. An optimized reaction
time of 15 min was selected to avoid both the presence of
unreacted starting material and degradation products.

Sodium

temperature (rt) under argon atmosphere, a solution of
NaOMe (prepared from 58.9 mg of Na0 in 5.1 mL of
anhydrous MeOH) was added dropwise. The mixture
was kept stirring for 5 h. After this period, the reaction
mixture was concentrated under vacuum until a precipitate
was formed and acetone was added to complete the
precipitation. The solid was filtered, washed with acetone
(3 × 10 mL), and dried under reduced pressure to afford
0.272 g (0.775 mmol, 61% yield) of the product as a white

Cell culture, cell extraction, and
immunoblot analysis

In vivo tumor studies and histochemical analysis
of tumor tissue

Cancer cell lines were purchased from ATCC,
Manassas, VA. Human Mammary Epithelial cells
immortalized by telomerase expression (tert-HMEC) have
been described previously [35]. Cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. Cell extracts were prepared as
described previously [36] and immunoblot analysis was
carried out with the following antibodies: EGFR (#4267),
phospho-EGFR[Y845] (#6963), PARP (#9532), phosphoAkt[T308] (#9275), Akt (#4691), phospho-Erk (#9101),
HER2 (#2165), HER3 (#4754), phospho-HER2[Y877]
(#2241), and phospho-S6 (#2211) from Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA; Erk (sc-93), phosphoTyrosine (sc-7020), and Actin (sc-1616) from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; phospho-Tyrosine
(4G-10, 05–321) from Millipore, Temecula, CA; E-cadherin
(610182) from BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA.

All experimental protocols were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the University of Florida. Tumors were initiated by
the injection of 2 × 106 BT474 cells into the mammary
fat pads of female NSG mice (005557, The Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) in sterile saline. Mice
with palpable tumors were randomly assigned to
vehicle (water) or 40 mg/kg RBF3 treatment groups for
tumor growth studies. Treatments were administered
Monday through Friday by intraperitoneal injection.
Tumor volumes were estimated using the formula:
Volume = (L*L*W)/2, where tumor length, L > tumor
width, W. Tumors and other tissues were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Tissues
were paraffin embedded and sections were cut and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) by the University
of Florida Molecular Pathology Core (http://molecular.
pathology.ufl.edu/).

Construction of stable cell lines
Analysis of DDA chemical reactivity by mass
spectrometry

T47D cells stably overexpressing EGFR were
constructed using the previously described retroviral
vector [37] purchased from Addgene (Plasmid #11011),
Cambridge, MA. Retrovirus was produced using the
amphotropic Phoenix cell line [38] and transduced cultures
were selected with 5 μg/ml puromycin.

Incubation of RBF3
A solution of RBF3 (8.9 mg, 2.0 × 10− 2 mmol) in
1.98 mL of DI water with 20 μL of 0.10 M phosphate
buffer (pH = 7.4) was stirred for 24 hours at 37°C (in an
oil bath) in a capped vial. After this period, the solution
was cooled to rt and an aliquot was collected and analyzed
by MS.

Cell proliferation and viability assays
Cell proliferation was measured by thymidine
incorporation as described previously [36]. Briefly, unless
otherwise stated cells were treated for 24 hours with
various compounds and cellular DNA was labeled with
3
H-thymidine for three hours. Cell viability was assessed
using either crystal violet staining or the MTT (3-(4,
5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide) assay. Crystal violet assays were carried out
according to an online protocol (http://www.whitelabs.org/)
and crystal violet binding to cells was quantified by elution
with methanol and measuring absorption at 590 nm. MTT
assays were carried out according to the Manufacturer’s
instructions (kit CGD1, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
