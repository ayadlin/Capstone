ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain cancer in adults.
Radiotherapy (RT) is the most effective post-operative treatment for the patients
even though GBM is one of the most radio-resistant tumors. Dead or dying cells within
the tumor are thought to promote resistance to treatment through mechanisms that
are very poorly understood. We have evaluated the role of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2),
a versatile bioactive lipid, in GBM radio-resistance. We used an in vitro approach
using 3D primary cultures derived from representative GBM patients. We show
that irradiated glioma cells produced and released PGE2 in important quantities
independently of the induction of cell death. We demonstrate that the addition of
PGE2 enhances cell survival and proliferation though its ability to trans-activate the
Epithelial Growth Factor receptor (EGFR) and to activate β-catenin. Indeed, PGE2 can
substitute for EGF to promote primary cultures survival and growth in vitro and the
effect is likely to occur though the Prostaglandin E2 receptor EP2.

Recent results have shown that RT induced a
mitogenic signal that could originate from dying tumor and
stromal cells [10]. Huang et al. [11] further demonstrated
that after caspase activation dying cells released the
bioactive lipid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which in turn
was capable of triggering tumor repopulation. The ability
of PGE2 to stimulate the proliferation of numerous types
of cells has been shown both in vivo and in vitro and
enzymes implicated in the synthesis of this prostanoid,
such as cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2), have been considered
as a major target for anti-cancer therapies [10]. PGE2
is implicated in numerous mechanisms including the
induction of cell migration to inflammation that can affect
in cancer progression in various different ways. PGE2 has
been shown to induce the synthesis of Bcl-2, a major antiapoptotic protein in colon cancer and as such could directly
control apoptosis [12]. On the other hand, we have shown

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most
common form of brain cancer in the adult and its prognosis
remains poor. Standard therapy includes surgery followed
by external beam radiotherapy (RT) and/or chemotherapy,
principally temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA alkylating/
methylating agent [1]. However, the effect of TMZ is
beneficiary only to a subset of patients that do not express
O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a
DNA repair enzyme [2]. GBM appear to be intrinsically
extremely radio-resistant and this has been linked to the
presence of cancer stem cells (CSC), which are efficient
in repairing DNA damage [3]. Radiation resistance has
also been linked to glioma heterogeneity [4], the lack of
apoptosis [5] or activation of Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, EGF
receptors and kinase signaling pathways [6–9].

that intracellular PGE2 triggers Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein,
activation and as such would participate in the induction of
apoptosis in both glioma and colon cancer [13–15]. These
results suggest that PGE2 may play multiple and somewhat
contradictory roles during cancer progression.
In the present study, we addressed the question of the
role PGE2 on tumor progression and survival, using primary
cultures derived from human GBM grown in 3D-cultures.

associated the induction of caspase activity in cancer cells to
the production of PGE2 upon irradiation of cancer cells [11,
13–15]. We then assessed the viability of the cells under our
conditions and found that only the high dose of irradiation
(10 Gy) provoked a cell growth arrest and subsequent cell
death after 48 h (Figure 1B, 1C). To determine whether the
cell death was caspase 3 dependent, the number of active
caspase 3 cells was quantified. As seen in Figure 1D,
there was a close correlation between the percent of cell
death and the percent of active caspase 3 cells. To evaluate
the implication of caspase in the production of PGE2,
we knocked down the expression of Bax, a central proapoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, in U251 cells. As
illustrated in Figure 1D, we observed a significant decrease
in the induction of caspase 3 activity in the absence of Bax
after γ-irradiation at 10 Gy. However, quite surprisingly, the
knock down of Bax appeared to promote the production
of PGE2 in untreated U251 cells and the amount of PGE2
is maintained upon irradiation (Figure 1E), as previously
observed in primary cultures of GBM [14]. Of note, the

RESULTS
Irradiation of the human glioma cell line
U251 induces the production of PGE2 without
activation of caspase 3 or apoptosis
The accumulation of PGE2 was measured 24 h after
γ-irradiation of the human glioma cell line U251 at different
intensities (i.e. 0, 5 and 10 Gy). As shown in Figure 1A,
the amount of PGE2 found in the culture supernatant was
proportional to the dose of radiation. Recent results have

Figure 1: Release of PGE2 from γ-irradiated cells. U251 cells were irradiated in serum-free medium at the indicated dose. PGE2

secretion was measured in supernatants after 24 h. The concentration of PGE2 (pg/ml) released from irradiated U251 cells was determined
using an ELISA (see materials and methods) (A). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion using the Countess automatic
cell counter (Life Technologies), 24 h after irradiation of U251 cells (B). Cell death was estimated as above at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h postirradiation (C). U251 cells were transduced with shRNA encoding viral particles [either encoding for a non-relevant shRNA (scr) or shRNA
directed against Bax mRNA]. Cells were irradiated in serum-free medium at 10 Gy; harvested at the indicated time points, fixed and labeled
with active caspase 3 antibody coupled to a fluorescent secondary antibody. The percentage of labeled cells was assessed by flow cytometry
(D). The corresponding PGE2 secretion was measured in supernatants during 48 h after irradiation at 5 Gy (E). Please note that in the latter
experiments, the secretion of PGE2 was decreased in scr-treated U251 compared to untreated cells (compare A and E).

induction of PGE2 in control cells reached a peak 8 h after a
10 Gy irradiation to returned to normal at 16 h (Figure 1E).
We conclude from these results that PGE2 could be
produced upon irradiation even in the absence of caspase
activation.

(Supplementary Figure S1 and Oliver et al. in preparation).
Primary cultures in defined medium grow as spheres or as
spheres and adherent cells whereas in serum complemented
medium all primary cultures were adherent (Figure 2A). In
all except one (15/16) primary culture we did not observed
activation of caspase upon irradiation as similar low caspase
3 activities were observed in irradiated and untreated primary
cultures. In Figure 2B, 3 primary cultures are given as an
example (1/16 with high caspase activity, 3/16 with medium
activity and 12/16 with low or no activity). Of note, the GBM
cultures were able to undergo caspase dependent apoptosis
as shown by their response to etoposide (Supplementary
Figure S2). However, since a similar production of PGE2
was observed in all cells (data not shown), we conclude that
it was independent of caspase activity and of the classes of
GBM. Next we examined the expression of members of
the BCL-2 family commonly found in GBM [17], in the
different primary cultures. We observed an almost complete
absence in the expression of Bcl-2 in 4/5 mesenchymal
primary cultures while the other primary cultures expressed

Irradiation, apoptosis and the expression of key
members of the BCL-2 family in GBM primary
cultures
To examine the biological consequence of the release
of PGE2 by GBM, we used primary cultures derived from
resected tumors. Cells dissociated from these tumors were
capable of growing as neurospheres and/or as adherent
cells in almost 80% of the cases. We were able to derive
primary cultures, which correspond to proneural (young
adults with a better prognosis but unresponsive to treatment),
classical, neural and mesenchymal (older adults with a
worse prognosis) classification of GBM corresponding
to the molecular subtypes defined by Verhaak et al. [16]

(left) and serum-supplemented (right) media. Depending on the type of GBMs and/or culture conditions, cells can grow as spheres and/or
as adherent cells (C = classical and M = mesenchymal subtypes) (A). Caspase induction was measured in primary cultures after irradiation
(10 Gy). The induction of caspase was observed in a single tumor. The cut-off for caspase 3 activation resulting in cell death was defined
at 50 AU/mg protein (B). The expression of key proteins of apoptosis was examined in primary cultures and illustrated in representative of
the different subtype (PN = proneural, N = neural, C = classical and M = mesenchymal) (C). The expression of the receptors of PGE2 (EP
1–4) was determined by western blots in the different representative primary cultures (D, E).

Bcl-2 in varying concentrations. The other proteins of the
BCL-2 family such as Bcl-Xl, Bax, Bak or Bad were present
in all the primary cultures at different levels (Figure 2C).
The expression of these proteins has been linked to
PGE2 signaling pathways [12]. As shown in Figure 2D, EP2
was expressed in the four different types of GBM in vitro at
similar level. Next, we examined the expression of the other
PGE2 receptors in vitro (Figure 2E), we found that EP1,
EP3 and EP4 receptors, which are also expressed in the
brain [18], had a variable expression in primary cultures.

of irradiated cell culture media (ICCM). As shown in
Figure 3A, cell proliferation was significantly increased upon
incubation of primary cultures with ICCM. This effect was
abolished after the immuno-depletion of PGE2. Note that the
addition of PGE2 in immuno-depleted ICCM was sufficient
to restore the effect on cell proliferation (Figure 3B).
Next we used the 3D co-culture in soft agar system to
determine the effects of the released PGE2 on the growth
and survival of primary cultures. Under these experimental
conditions U251 cells were irradiated with 5 Gy and 24 h
later primary cultures were overlaid in soft agar and
cultured for a further 3 weeks, as described in the methods
section. Our first observation was the complete absence of
large colonies in primary cultures overlaid over irradiated
U251 cells as compared to control dishes (Figure 3C).
However, the number of colonies in the co-cultures (primary
cultures + irradiated U251 cells) was significan­tly increased.
Next, we examined the expression of the different PGE2

Response of GBM primary cultures to PGE2
Similar to U251, γ-irradiated primary cultures
produced PGE2 although this production was heterogeneous
and most of PGE2 remained associated to the spheres rather
than released into the culture medium (data not shown).
Primary GBM were cultivated in the presence of supernatant

Effect of PGE2 on the number and size of
neurospheres in the presence or in the absence
of EGF

receptors in the primary cultures: first the expression of EP2
as it is the most widely expressed prostaglandin receptor
in the brain and it is functionally coupled to anti-apoptotic
and protective functions in neurons and in secondary
neurotoxicity during inflammation [18, 19].
We did not observe any significant differences either
on the cell cycle and apoptosis upon incubation with
10 μM PGE2 for 72 h between the different GBM cultures
(Figure 4A) or on cell viability (Figure 4B).
It has been suggested that PGE2 liberated from dead
or dying cells could regulate stem cells homeostasis and
differentiation [20]. As our culture conditions support the
survival and the proliferation of CSC [3], we examined
if PGE2 could induce a change in the proportion of CSCs
by analyzing the expression of stemness markers upon
long-term exposure to the bioactive lipid. As shown
in Figure 4C, the expression of stemness markers were
markedly different in the different types of GBM primary
cultures: some expressed markers for all types of neural
cells (i.e. Olig2, GFAP and β-tubulin), and others
expressing limited amount of neural markers (i.e. the
neuronal β-tubulin) while others expressed high level of
nestin and β-tubulin and low level of Olig2 and GFAP. In
all cases incubation with PGE2 did not affect the nature
and/or the level of these markers.

PGE2 has been shown to trans-activate EGFR
through its rapid phosphorylation [21, 22]. Since, GBM
primary cultures are cultivated in the presence of EGF,
we examined the effect of PGE2 in the absence or in
the presence of this growth factor. We found that GBM
primary cultures grew similarly in the presence or in the
absence of PGE2 when EGF was present (Figure  5A).
However, in absence of EGF, the addition of PGE2
increased both the size and the number of spheres, which
reached in size, but not in numbers, a level similar to that
observed in the presence of EGF (Figure 5A). Note that
the addition of PGE2 alone did not have the same effect
as PGE2 released from irradiated U251 cells. This could
be due to the fact that the biolipid is very labile and has
a very short half-life or to the presence of other factors.
Possibly the continual release of PGE2 by dying cells has
a more dramatic effect or the effect observed could be due
to a combination of factors released.
Next we used agonists against EP2 and EP4 to
determine the PGE2 receptor implicated in this effect.
Results obtained in 3D cultures showed that Butaprost, an

(A) and cell viability (B) was observed over a period of 72 h. We also analyzed the effect of PGE2 on the expression of stemness markers
under similar conditions and as illustrated in (C), the expression of these markers was not affected by the treatment.

Figure 5: PGE2 and the EGF signaling pathway. We examined the effect of PGE2 on both the amount of the sizes of spheres in

the presence (top) or in the absence (bottom) of EGF. Primary cultures were grown in 3D cultures in the absence (black lines) or in the
presence of 10 μM PGE2 for 3 weeks and the colonies formed were quantified using MetaMorph soft-ware (A) The data presented are
representative of 3 independent experiments. Primary cultures were grown in soft agar in the absence or presence of agonist against EP2
(50 nM Butaprost) and EP4 (1 nM L902,688). After 3 weeks the number and size of neurospheres were determined (B). PGE2 (10 μM)
induces transactivation of EGFR. Proximity ligation in situ assay (P-LISA) adapted from the O-link protocol was used to monitor the
phosphorylation of EGFR after addition of 10 mM PGE2 in the cells. Each red dot indicates a close proximity between EGFR (rabbit
monoclonal) and pEGFR (mouse monoclonal). Graph represents the statistical analysis of the number of interactions versus time. The data
presented are the mean of 2 experiments done in triplicate (C).

agonist of EP2 and not L902,688, an EP4 ligand, trigger a
PGE2 like effect in the absence of EGF (Figure 5B). These
results suggest that EGFR signaling could be implicated in
the effect of PGE2 in primary cultures. EGFR was expressed
in almost all primary cultures and basal phosphorylation
monitored by immunoblot indicated that the receptor
was phosphorylated under our conditions (Supplementary
Figure S3). Incubation of primary cultures with PGE2 for 72
h did not show any significant activation of EGFR through
increased phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S3). Next
we look at a short-term activation of EGFR by PGE2 using
the OLINK technique [23]. As illustrated in Figure 5C,
PGE2 induced a strong but transient phosphorylation of the
receptor after 5 min incubation.
EGFR triggered the extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK)-mitogenic activated protein kinase (ERK/
MAPK) signaling in many cells lines, an important

component of radiation-induced hormesis [24] and
glioma radio-resistance [25]. Primary cultures were
treated with PGE2 and then the phosphorylation of ERK
was quantified using a total phosphoERK1/2 ELISA. As
shown in Figure  6A, the addition of PGE2 triggered a
phosphorylation of ERK in primary cultures after 48 hours.
In colon cancer, PGE2 has been implicated in the
induction of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and as such to
potentially play a critical role in carcinogenesis [26]. We
analyze the activation of this pathway under our conditions
by incubating primary cultures with 10 mM PGE2 for
48 h. Cells were than analyzed for β-catenin activation
by immunohistochemistry (Figure 6B). The activation
of β-catenin by PGE2 was compared to that induced by
lithium and as shown in Figure 6B, both treatments led
to the activation of β-catenin while on the other hand no
effect on its phosphorylation was observed. We observed

control (B). We also analyzed the effect of PGE2 on EGFR and activeβ-catenin in the presence or in the absence of EGF (C).

presence and in the absence of EGF, although the induction
was more important in the latter case (Figure 6C).

proliferation signal could be generated by PGE2 produced
upon activation of caspase 3, an enzyme essential for the
completion of apoptosis, by radiotherapy [11]. We have
shown that apoptosis is accompanied by an increase
in the production of intracellular PGE2 in glioma and
colon cancer but that this increase was upstream of the
activation of caspase 3 [13–15]. We have observed that
some GBM express high amounts of m-PGES1, the
enzyme responsible for the synthesis of PGE2 from PGH,
the product of COX2 [13]. Interestingly, the expression
of m-PGES was associated with apoptosis and in vitro
analyses indicated that this apoptosis was strictly Bax
dependent [13–15]. We found that the production of PGE2
was triggered by most apoptotic inducers and that cells
resistant to apoptosis accumulated and released abundant
level of the lipid through MRP4, a PGE2 transporter both
in glioma and colon cancer cells [13–15]. In the present
work, we show that radiation can trigger PGE2 synthesis
in glioma without inducing caspase activity. This PGE2
liberated participated in the survival and proliferation of
surviving cancer cells by activating several pathways,
including EGFR and β-catenin. Indeed, our results suggest
that PGE2 can substitute for EGF to promote survival of

DISCUSSION
Glioma are resistant to chemo-therapy induced
apoptosis [27]. Radio-therapy is the most effective
therapy in GBM although these tumors remain largely
refractory to the treatment. Mechanisms implicated in
GBM radio-resistance are not well-known and unraveling
them could provide new indications for better treatment
strategies. Fractional/partial killing by radiation has
been associated with a more rapid proliferation of the
surviving cells and repopulation has been viewed over
the longtime, as a major therapeutic challenge [28, 29].
This effect has been linked to the radiation-induced
release of mitogenic factors by normal and/or cancer cells
(30), the stimulation of radio-resistant tumor initiating
cells [3, 31]. Recently, one potential mechanism, called
“Phoenix Rising”, has been proposed to explain this effect
[11, 20]. Huang et al. elegantly demonstrated that the

irradiated cells. This observation is in agreement with
numerous studies showing that accelerated repopulation
during radiotherapy could be linked to the activation of
EGFR and the subsequent activation of ERK/MAP kinase
mitogenic pathways [28]. However, our results show also
that PGE2 under our conditions is a pro-survival factor and
that irradiated cells released pro-proliferative factors that
remain to be identified.
PGE2 has also been shown to specifically reactivate
the repopulation of normal cells by stimulating normal
stem cells [32]. However, in our hands, we did not
observed any change in the expression of stemness
markers upon PGE2 treatment in glioma primary cultures
regardless of the molecular sub-class of GBM and
independently of the proportion of CD133+ cells.
The roles of PGE2 in non targeted and targeted
effects of ionizing radiations, especially in the
inflammatory context [33], or on stem cells homeostasis
[32] are not fully understood. Recently, COX2 and PGE2
have been implicated in cancer progression but mixed
results were obtained with COX2 inhibitors and radiosensitization [34, 35]. Our results provide a molecular
mechanism, by which PGE2 can sustain tumor growth
and proliferation after tumor irradiation and support new
alternative targets, such as EP2, to potentiate the effect of
radiotherapy.

Quantity of phosphorylated and total protein was
measured using the InstantOne ELISA kit (eBioscience)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, cells
were lysed with 50 μL lysis buffer and incubated 1 h at
room temperature with 50 μL antibody cocktail containing
antibodies against total or phosphorylated forms and the
peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. Colorimetric
detection reagent (100 μl) was added and the reaction read
at 450 nm.

Protein lysates, immunoblotting and caspase

Total proteins were extracted in (25 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 1% Na-deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitors.
Protein concentration was determined using BCA
protein assay (Sigma). Proteins were separated by SDSPAGE, transferred onto PVDF membrane (Millipore,
St Quentin-Yvelines, France) and revealed with ECL
(Millipore). Antibodies that recognize actin (Millipore),
Bax (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA), Bcl-2
(BD Pharmingen), EGFR and pEGFR (Cell Signaling

Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz CA, USA), GFAP (Calbiochem,
Darmstadt, Germany), nestin (Millipore, Temecula, CA,
USA), olig2 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and β-tubulin
(Sigma–Aldrich) were used. HRP-conjugated secondary
antibodies were from BioRad. The ImageJ64 software was
used to quantify Western blot bands. Caspase 3 activity
was determined using the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVDAMC, as described in [14]. Note, for all the assays the cutoff limit of caspase 3 activation that induces cell death was
determined at > 50 AU/mg protein.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Unless stated otherwise, all cell culture material was
obtained from Life Technologies (Cergy Pontoise, France)
and chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA).

Cell culture
Human primary cultures were grown in defined
medium (DMEM/HAM-F12, 2 mM L-glutamine, N2 and
B27 supplement, 2 μg/ml heparin, 20 ng/ml EGF and 25 ng/
ml bFGF, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin
and the U251-MG cell line was cultured in DMEM (4.5 g/L
glucose), 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/
mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in an atmosphere
of 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.

PGE2 assay and immunodepletion
U251 cells (×105) were seeded in 6 well plates.
Complete medium was replaced by serum-free medium
24 h later and cells were γ-irradiated at the indicated
intensity. Conditioned medium was recovered at indicated
time points for PGE2 measurement. PGE2 assay was done
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham,
GE Healthcare Europe, Velizy-Villacoublay, Fr). Cells
were harvested and either assayed for cell viability or fixed
and probed for active caspase 3 by flow cytometry (BD
Pharmingen; 0.25 μg/106 cells). When indicated, conditioned
medium was depleted of PGE2 by filtration through PGE2
affinity column according to the manufacturer (Cayman).

3D-culture
Primary GBM cells (2.5 × 103) resuspended in 0.35%
soft agar containing different compounds were layered on
0.5% agar. The soft agar layer was covered with media
containing the compound to be tested. After 3 weeks, the
cultures were scanned using a Leica DMI6000B and the
Metamorph program. γ-irradiation was carried out in a
Faxitron CP160 irradiator (Faxitron X-ray Corporation) at
a dose rate of 1.48 Gy/min.
