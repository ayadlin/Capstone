Abstract
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is implicated widely in cancer pathophysiology. Dual
inhibition of the mTOR kinase complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 decreases tumor xenograft growth in vivo and
VEGF secretion in vitro, but the relationship between these two effects are unclear. In this study, we examined
the effects of mTORC1/2 dual inhibition on VEGF production, tumor angiogenesis, vascular regression, and
vascular regrowth, and we compared the effects of dual inhibition to mTORC1 inhibition alone. ATP-competitive
inhibitors OSI-027 and OXA-01 targeted both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in vitro and in vivo, unlike
rapamycin that only inhibited mTORC1 signaling. OXA-01 reduced VEGF production in tumors in a manner
associated with decreased vessel sprouting but little vascular regression. In contrast, rapamycin exerted less
effect on tumoral production of VEGF. Treatment with the selective VEGFR inhibitor OSI-930 reduced vessel
sprouting and caused substantial vascular regression in tumors. However, following discontinuation of OSI-930
administration tumor regrowth could be slowed by OXA-01 treatment. Combining dual inhibitors of mTORC1
and mTORC2 with a VEGFR2 inhibitor decreased tumor growth more than either inhibitor alone. Together,
these results indicate that dual inhibition of mTORC1/2 exerts antiangiogenic and antitumoral effects that are
even more efficacious when combined with a VEGFR antagonist. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1573–83. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/
threonine kinase, integrates multiple signaling pathways,
including cell growth and survival. mTOR exists in 2 complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 activation controls
cell growth by regulating translation, ribosome biogenesis,
autophagy, and metabolism (1). mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt,
SGK1, and PKC to control multiple functions including cell
survival and cytoskeletal organization (2).
Many mTOR activators and effectors are overexpressed or
mutated in cancer (3). Rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs)
are allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1 that are clinically effective
in some tumors (3, 4). mTORC1 inhibition, however, activates
mTORC2 signaling via p70S6K-IRS1 negative feedback, thus
limiting the efficacy of rapalogs (5–7). Recent evidence indiAuthors' Affiliations: 1Cardiovascular Research Institute, Comprehensive

cates broader and more robust anticancer effects are achieved
by inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 (8–11). Furthermore, mTOR catalytic site inhibitors elicit greater inhibition of
mTORC1 activity. Consistent with mTORC2 regulation of Akt,
these studies show greater reductions in Akt signaling and
tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting both mTORC1 and
mTORC2 compared with just mTORC1 (8–11). mTORC1/
mTORC2 inhibition also reduces HIF1-alpha expression,
VEGF secretion, and tumor angiogenesis (10, 11).
VEGF inhibitors reduce angiogenesis, cause tumor vessel
regression, slow tumor growth, and may improve drug delivery
(12–15). Despite the well-documented role for VEGF in tumor
angiogenesis and growth (16), current approaches block the
VEGF ligand or receptor. Little is known about the effects on
the tumor vasculature of reducing VEGF production. Although
VEGF inhibitors can destroy as much as 80% of the tumor
vasculature, most tumor vessels grow back after the treatment
ends (17). This vessel regrowth is likely due to continued VEGF
production because inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases or
type IV collagen cryptic sites does not slow revascularization (17).
Previous studies examined mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition
on VEGF secretion in vitro (11) or rapamycin on tumor vessels
in vivo (10, 18, 19). However, mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition on
tumor vessels and VEGF production in vivo has not been
studied. We hypothesized that dual mTORC1 and mTORC2
inhibition would provide superior inhibition of Akt signaling
and VEGF production and greater effects on tumor cells and
tumor vasculature than inhibition of mTORC1 alone. To study

this, we used small molecule ATP-competitive inhibitors,
OXA-01 and OSI-027. These drugs selectively inhibit both
mTORC1 and mTORC2. We compared the effects of these
molecules with rapamycin, an allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor.
Moreover, we determined if combining mTORC1/mTORC2
and VEGFR inhibition had greater antitumor effects than
either inhibitor alone. Our findings indicate that mTORC1/
mTORC2 inhibition impacted tumors through 2 mechanisms:
first, direct effects on tumor cells decreased proliferation and
increased apoptosis; and second, antivasculature effects were
more pronounced than after mTORC1 inhibition alone. When
dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition was combined with
VEGFR inhibition, effects on tumor cell proliferation and
apoptosis and on tumor growth were even greater. Together,
these results support the use of mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors
as monotherapy, as monotherapy alternating with an
antiangiogenic agent, or as combination therapy given concurrently with an antiangiogenic agent.

Materials and Methods

Immunohistochemistry and protein array
Following treatment, RIP-Tag2 mice were fixed by vascular
perfusion, tumors were processed for immunohistochemistry,
and 60–80 mm sections were stained as described (13, 24).
Endothelial cells, basement membrane, VEGF, erythrocytes,
proliferating and apoptotic cells, and phosphorylated S6K, Akt
and 4E-BP1 were identified by immunohistochemistry as
described in the Supplementary Methods. VEGF in tumor
lysates was carried out using mouse angiogenesis arrays (R&D
Systems) according to manufacturer's directions.

Biochemical and cellular selectivity assays
mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibition was assayed using native
enzyme complex immunoprecipitated from HeLa lysates at
1mM ATP as described (20). The HTRF assay was used for the
PI3K assay (Millipore) and DNA-PK activity was measured
using human recombinant p53 protein (Axxora) and phosphop53 (S15) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies). Both
assays used 100 mmol/L ATP. Panels of additional kinases
were assessed for OXA-01 and OSI- 027 selectivity as described
in the supplemental methods.

Microscopy and image analysis
Stained sections of RIP-Tag2 pancreas were examined with
Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence and LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscopes. Area densities were calculated from fluorescence images with ImageJ software (25) using an empirically
determined threshold of 30–50 as previously described (13, 17,
23). Fluorescence intensity was determined as previously
described (17) and outlined in detail in the Supplemental
Methods. Endothelial sprouts were examined as previously
described (24, 26).

Cell culture
H292 cells from ATCC were cultured as directed. Ovcar-5
cells, a generous gift of Dr. T. Frederick, were cultured in RPMI
plus 10% serum and 1% L-glutamine.

Statistical analysis
Values expressed as SEM reflect 3–8 mice per group. Significance of differences was determined using ANOVA followed by the Fisher PLSD post hoc test. For in vivo efficacy
studies, rank ANOVA with Dunnett's comparison was used.
P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

In vivo antitumor efficacy studies
For xenograft models, cells were harvested, implanted s.c. in
the right flank of nu/nu CD-1 mice and tumor growth was
analyzed as described (21, 22). Tumor growth inhibition and
regression calculations are included in supplemental methods. Tumor samples were collected and snap frozen at specified time points. Tumor lysates were prepared by
homogenization (Precellys-24 homogenizer) in lysis buffer
(1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 10
mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4 and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma)). Phosphorylated and total 4EBP1, Akt or S6 were quantified by Western blot using MultiGauge software (FujiFilm).
RIP-Tag2 mouse studies
RIP-Tag2 mice were used as described (13, 17, 23). At 9–10
weeks of age, RIP-Tag2 mice were treated for up to 7 days with
vehicle (Labrifil or water); 75 mg/kg OXA-01 BID by gavage;
200 mg/kg OSI-930 QD by gavage; or 20 mg/kg rapamycin QD
by ip injection. For vascular regrowth studies, 10-week-old

RIP-Tag2 mice were treated with: (a) vehicle for 11 days; (b)
OSI-930 for 7 days; (c) OSI-930 for 7 days followed by vehicle
for 4 days; (d) OSI-930 for 7 days followed by OXA-01 for 4 days;
(e) OSI-930 for 7 days followed by rapamycin for 4 days. Mice
used for drug combination studies were treated at doses of 100
mg/kg for OSI-930, 100 mg/kg for OXA-01, and 20 mg/kg for
rapamycin, QD for 4 days. During treatments, body weights
were monitored daily. If mice lost more than 10% of initial
body weight, supplemental fluids were given.

Results
Selectivity of OXA-01 and OSI-027
The goal of this study was to compare dual mTORC1/
mTORC2 inhibition on VEGF production, tumor blood vessels,
and tumor growth to mTORC1 inhibition alone by rapamycin.
To study mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition, we used selective, ATP
competitive inhibitors of the mTOR kinase, OXA-01 and OSI027. Because these compounds inhibited mTOR kinase activity,
each targeted mTORC1 and mTORC2. The IC50 for OXA-01 and
OSI-027 was 11 nmol/L and 4 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1).
Immunoprecipitation with anti-Raptor antibodies (mTORC1
activity) or anti-Rictor (mTORC2 activity) showed these compounds potently inhibited both mTOR complexes. Greater than
100-fold selectivity was observed for mTOR relative to other
PIKK-related kinases in biochemical assays. We also examined
OXA-01 and OSI-027 specificity in cell-based assays. OXA-01
and OSI-027 inhibited mTOR signaling of phospho-4E-BP1 with
an IC50 of 1.1 mmol/L and 1mmol/L respectively (Fig. 1). Greater

OSI-027, but not rapamycin, dose-dependently attenuated
Akt phosphorylation at the mTORC2-specific Ser473 site and
the downstream substrate of Akt, PRAS40 (Supplemental
Fig. 1A). OXA-01 and OSI-027 inhibited 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at Ser37/46, which are typically rapamycin insensitive.
Rapamycin failed to inhibit Akt, PRAS40, or 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at these sites, and induced phospho-Akt. Both
the mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors and rapamycin-inhibited
S6Kinase and its substrate S6, consistent with mTORC1
regulation of these effectors. Effects of OXA-01, OSI-027,
and rapamycin on Akt, 4E-BP1, and S6K phosphorylation
were quantified (Supplemental Figure 1B).

than 100-fold selectivity against 37 other protein kinases from
tyrosine and serine/threonine families was observed (data not
shown). In an assessment of OXA-01 and OSI-027 activity
against 98 purified protein kinases, these compounds fully
inhibited mTOR. Only 3 kinases were inhibited greater than
90% by OXA-01 and OSI-027: PI3Kd, PI3Kg, and RET. JNK3 and
MEK2, were inhibited by OXA-01, whereas PIP5Kg was significantly inhibited by OSI-027 (data not shown). Both OSI-027
and OXA-01 were inactive against PDK1.

In vivo effect of OSI-027, OXA-01, and rapamycin on
mTORC1/ mTORC2 signaling and tumor growth
We hypothesized that mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibition
together would slow tumor growth more than mTORC1
inhibition by rapamycin. Effects on GEO colorectal xenograft growth treated with rapamycin (Fig. 2A) or OSI-027
(Fig. 2B) for 12 days were consistent with our in vitro
experiments. Treatment with rapamycin (20 mg/kg) inhibited phospho-S6 and phospho-4E-BP1, whereas Akt phosphorylation was increased by 29% (Fig. 2A). In contrast,
OSI-027 (65 mg/kg) inhibited both mTORC1 and mTORC2
effectors. After 2 hours, decreased 4E-BP1, Akt, and S6
phosphorylation was observed and inhibition of S6 and
Akt was sustained for 24 hours (Fig. 2B). The plasma drug
concentration of OSI-027 inversely correlated with these
effects on mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling, and similar
pharmacokinetic profiles were observed for OXA-01 (data
not shown). The median plasma drug concentration with
OSI-027 was 21.3 mmol/L at 2 hours and 14.9 mmol/L at
8 hours. The median plasma concentration of OXA-01 was
25.6 mmol/L at 1 hour and 13.2 mmol/L at 8 hours (data not
shown). Consistent with their inhibition of mTORC1 and
mTORC2, both OSI-027 (Fig. 2C) and OXA-01 (Fig. 2D)
slowed tumor growth more than did rapamycin.
The effects of mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition were further
compared with mTORC1 inhibition in RIP-Tag2 pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors. Similar to earlier observations,
OXA-01 decreased Akt and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, while
rapamycin-mediated inhibition of either effector was not
observed (Fig. 3A, B). In contrast, both OXA-01 and rapamycin
treatment inhibited phopsho-S6K, relative to control (Supplemental figure 2). As indicated by reduced tumor growth
in xenograft models, OXA-01 treatment decreased cellular
proliferation determined by phospho-histone H3 (Fig. 3C)
and increased apoptosis measured by activated-caspase-3
(Fig. 3D).
Comparison of OXA-01 or rapamycin on VEGF in RIPTag2 tumors
Reduced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at residues T37, T46, S65,
and T70 decreases cap-dependent protein translation (27).
Because OXA-01 and OSI-027 inhibited rapamycin-resistant
sites on 4E-BP1, we hypothesized that OXA-01 treatment
would reduce VEGF production more than rapamycin. RIPTag2 tumors have high VEGF expression, and the vasculature

is sensitive to VEGF inhibition (13), making the model suitable
to evaluate the effects of mTOR inhibition on VEGF production
and downstream changes in tumor vessels. After treatment
with vehicle for 7 days, tumor cells and tumor vessels had
intense and roughly equal levels of VEGF immunoreactivity
(Fig. 4A and B). VEGF staining in tumor vessels had a diffuse
component and a punctate component. VEGF immunofluorescence was conspicuously less in both tumor cells and vessels
after OXA-01 for 7 days, but the reduction in tumor cells was
greater, as evidenced by the persisting pattern of vascular
staining (Fig. 4A–B). After rapamycin, VEGF staining was
slightly less than baseline, and the reduction was more in
tumor cells than in vessels (Fig. 4A-B). Overall VEGF fluorescence of entire tumors was reduced by 12%, 48%, and 45% after
OXA-01 for 1, 4, or 7 days and only 21% after rapamycin for
7 days (Fig. 4C, left). VEGF fluorescence intensity associated
with tumor cells was reduced by 65% after OXA-01 for 7 days
and was reduced only 34% after rapamycin. VEGF fluorescence
associated with tumor vessels was reduced by 48% after OXA01 but only by 20% after rapamycin (Fig. 4C, right).
VEGF expression was also measured in RIP-Tag2 tumors
using a multiplex antibody array. Densitometric analysis
showed 72% less VEGF-A after OXA-01, but no significant
reduction after rapamycin (Fig. 4D). VEGF-B expression was
unchanged by either treatment (data not shown). The differences in VEGF reductions identified by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4C) and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4D)
likely reflect the sensitivity of the assays, but both assays
showed significantly less VEGF after OXA-01 than after
rapamycin.

Effect of OXA-01, rapamycin, and OSI-930 on the tumor
vasculature
Because VEGF is important for tumor angiogenesis, we
determined whether the decrease in VEGF after OXA-01 or
rapamycin reduced RIP-Tag2 tumor vascularity and compared the effect with a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
OSI-930 (28). CD31-positive tumor blood vessels were abundant in untreated RIP-Tag2 tumors (Fig. 5A). Treatment with
OXA-01 for 7 days reduced tumor blood vessels slightly.
Rapamycin did not noticeably reduce tumor vascularity,
but OSI-930 for 7 days was associated with a large reduction.
After OXA-01, tumor vascularity was not detectably reduced at
1, 2, or 4 days but was reduced by 23% at 7 days, compared
with baseline. Tumor vascularity was not significantly reduced
after rapamycin, but was reduced by 61% after OSI-930 for
7 days (Fig. 5B). After VEGF signaling inhibition in tumors,
empty basement membrane sleeves can be used as an indication of vessel regression (17, 26). Basement membrane sleeves
were not apparent after vehicle, OXA-01, or rapamycin, but
were numerous after OSI-930 for 7 days (Fig. 5C). As an
indication of effect on angiogenesis in tumors, the number
of vascular sprouts was reduced by 54% after OXA-01, 21%
after rapamycin, and 61% after OSI-930, in comparison to
untreated tumors (Fig. 5D).
Effect of OXA-01 and rapamycin on vascular regrowth
VEGF inhibition causes tumor vessel regression, but vessel
regrowth occurs rapidly after treatment ends (17). Because
OXA-01 reduced VEGF and vascular sprouting, we asked
whether OXA-01 or rapamycin could prevent vascular

regrowth after cessation of VEGFR inhibition by OSI-930. RIPTag2 mice were treated with OSI-930 for 7 days, followed by
4 days of treatment with vehicle, OXA-01, or rapamycin. The 4day time point was chosen because after OXA-01 for 4 days,
VEGF was significantly reduced but tumor vascularity was
unchanged (Figs. 4C and 5B). OSI-930 for 7 days reduced
tumor vascularity by 63%, consistent with our previous observations. Four days after cessation of OSI-930, tumors treated
with vehicle exhibited only an 18% decrease in vessel density.
Tumors treated with OXA-01 for 4 days after withdrawal of
OSI-930 had 40% fewer tumor vessels, but tumors treated with
rapamycin were equivalent to vehicle-treated controls (15%
reduction) (Fig. 6A). Tumors treated with OXA-01 for 1 day
after withdrawal of OSI-930, however, had no significant
decrease in tumor vessel regrowth, which fit with our finding
that OXA-01 for 1 day was insufficient to reduce VEGF (data
not shown).
Because VEGF promotes tumor angiogenesis and vascular
leakage, we asked whether reductions in VEGF with OXA-01
or rapamycin affected intratumoral hemorrhage assessed by
an erythrocyte marker, TER-119. Treatment with OSI-930 for
7 days reduced TER-119 immunoreactivity in RIP-Tag2
tumors by 72%, indicative of a reduction in hemorrhage
(Fig. 6B). However, 4 days after cessation of OSI-930, TER-

www.aacrjournals.org

119 levels were within 28% of baseline. In contrast, TER-119
levels in tumors treated with OXA-01 or rapamycin
after discontinuation of OSI-930 were 50% or 48% less than
baseline.
Effects of mTORC1/2 inhibition in combination with
VEGFR inhibition
We hypothesized that combining OSI-930 and OXA-01
would reduce tumor growth to a greater extent than either
inhibitor alone through additive effects of targeting tumor
vessels with OSI-930 and tumor cells with OXA-01. To evaluate
this, we examined OSI-930 plus OXA-01 or rapamycin on
proliferation (phospho-histone H3) and apoptosis (activated
caspase-3). OSI-930 plus OXA-01 reduced phospho-histone H3
more than OSI-930 plus rapamycin (Fig. 7A). In addition, OSI930 combined with OXA-01 was accompanied by a 700%
increase in activated caspase-3, but rapamycin plus OSI-930
had no significant effect (Fig. 7B).
The RIP-Tag2 model is useful for evaluating the tumor
vasculature, but provides a challenging platform for measuring tumor growth kinetics. To confirm the effects of VEGF
inhibition combined with mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition,
we used human tumor xenograft models. Because VEGF
inhibitors combined with mTOR catalytic site inhibitors could

be an option for clinical trials, we used sunitinib, a multitargeted VEGFR2 inhibitor approved for use in the clinic, with
OSI-027, which is in clinical trials. Sunitinib has similar
selectivity profiles and equivalent potency for VEGFR2 as
OSI-930. Both OSI-930 and sunitinib have a biochemical
IC50 for VEGFR2 of 9 nM (28–30). Furthermore, OXA-01 plus
OSI-930 was not well-tolerated in rodent models for long-term
treatment, but no toxicity was found with the OSI-027 and
sunitinib combination. The in vivo efficacy of OSI-027 plus
sunitinib was tested in H292 human lung and Ovcar-5 human
ovarian xenograft tumors. H292 tumors, treated with OSI-027

with sunitinib, however, had a median TGI of 100% with 59%

maximal tumor regression (Fig. 7C), a statistically significant
improvement over either agent alone. Ovcar-5 xenograft
tumors treated with OSI-027 or sunitinib had a 55% and
68% median TGI, respectively. OSI-027 administered with
sunitinib had a significantly better median TGI of 100% with
38% maximal tumor regression (Fig. 7D).

Discussion
Differential effects of dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition
versus mTORC1 inhibition on tumor cells and tumor vessels
were examined in this study. Consistent with previous reports,
we found that mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibition reduced
tumor cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, reduced
p-S6K, p-Akt and p-4E-BP1 signaling, and decreased tumor

growth compared to vehicle or rapamycin treatment (8–11).
Thus, mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition with OSI-027 or OXA-01
provided greater control of tumor cell proliferation and
induction of apoptosis than rapamycin. Dual inhibition of
mTORC1 and mTORC2 also had greater antiangiogenic effects
than mTORC1 inhibition. OXA-01 reduced VEGF production
in RIP-Tag2 tumors more than rapamycin. The reduction in
VEGF production was associated with decreased tumor angiogenesis but not tumor vessel regression. OXA-01 also reduced
vascular regrowth following cessation VEGFR2 inhibition with
OSI-930. Finally, combining VEGFR inhibition with mTORC1/
mTORC2 inhibition reduced tumor cell proliferation, stimulated tumor cell apoptosis and reduced tumor growth.
Together, these results provide support for clinical development of mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitors to be used as single

agents, in concurrent combination with antiangiogenic therapeutics or intercalated with antiangiogenic therapies in an
alternating schedule.
Rapalogs are efficacious in some tumors, but feedback
activation may limit clinical usefulness (7, 31). We reasoned
that inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 together would have
greater efficacy than mTORC1 inhibition alone. For these
studies we used rapamycin as a selective allosteric inhibitor
of mTORC1. Although rapalogs (everolimus and temsirolimus)
are more frequently used cancer therapeutics, these drugs
are mechanistically similar to rapamycin and rapamycin is a
well-characterized preclinical tool compound. Compared to
rapamycin, we found that mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition with
OXA-01 or OSI-027 produced greater reductions in downstream signaling effectors and had greater antitumor efficacy

in vivo. The reduction in tumor growth probably resulted from
reduction in tumor cell proliferation, but increased apoptosis
may contribute to this effect. These results are consistent with
greater reductions in cell proliferation after mTORC1/
mTORC2 inhibition (8–11) and increased apoptosis in a subset
of cell lines (11).
Although rapamycin inhibits mTORC1, with prolonged
treatment mTORC2 signaling is reduced in select cell lines,
presumably through depletion of mTOR from the Rictor
complex (32). However, in this study inhibition of the
mTORC2 effector Akt or the rapamycin-insensitive sites on
4E-BP1(37/46) after rapamycin treatment in vivo was not
observed. Furthermore, in these studies the maximum tolerable dose of rapamycin (20 mg/kg) was used, which is considerably higher than the correlative clinically relevant dose in
humans (33).

OXA-01 treatment of RIP-Tag2 tumors decreased VEGF
content and tumor vessel growth. Previous in vitro studies
showed decreased VEGF secretion with rapamycin or dual
mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition (11), suggesting VEGF production is dependent on mTORC1. In our in vivo studies, rapamycin modestly reduced VEGF, whereas a greater reduction
was achieved with OXA-01. VEGF production is controlled by
cap-dependent and -independent translation (34). Although
rapamycin represses phosphorylation of S6K and certain
sites on 4E-BP1, other 4E-BP1 sites (Thr37 and Thr46) are
rapamycin-resistant (35). Therefore, mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition may more completely inhibit cap-dependent translation to maximize the reduction of VEGF in vivo (11). Because
VEGF is dependent on translational regulation, reductions in
VEGF content is likely from decreased protein synthesis,
however, reduced storage and secretion are possible.

VEGF was reduced in both tumor cells and in clusters
associated with the tumor vasculature. This clustered pattern
of VEGF immunofluorescence likely represents internalization
of VEGF and VEGFR complexes into endothelial cells, as
previously described (36–38). Intracellular VEGF complexes
are dependent on Akt activation (37). Thus, decreased VEGF
internalization with mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition may be
from both reduced VEGF production and Akt signaling.
Inhibitors of the VEGF receptor (e.g., OSI-930, sunitinib,
axitinib) or ligand (e.g. bevacizumab) stop tumor vessel
growth and prune existing vessels (39). Here, we show reduced
VEGF production with mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition
decreases tumor blood vessel growth, but does not cause
vessel regression. In a previous study, tumor blood vessels
were reduced when mice were pretreated with a mTORC1/
mTORC2 inhibitor prior to injection of tumor cells (10),
consistent with the idea that mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition
targets tumor vessel growth. Additional studies showed conditional expression of activated-Akt in endothelial cells leads
to large and leaky vessels (18, 40). In those studies, rapamycininhibited tumor vessel growth, possibly indicating different

www.aacrjournals.org

thresholds for rapamycin sensitivity depending on Akt
activity.
Interestingly, small reductions in VEGF with rapamycin
reduced the reappearance of tumor hemorrhage after cessation of VEGFR inhibition, consistent with rapamycinmediated reductions in vessel leakiness (18). However, larger
reductions in VEGF with OXA-01 treatment, reduced the
reappearance of both tumor hemorrhage and tumor vessels.
Hemorrhage is an indication of tumor vessel leakiness and
blood lakes caused by hemorrhage are a conspicuous feature
of RIP-Tag2 pancreatic tumors (41, 42). Together, these data
suggest small reductions in VEGF prevent tumor vessel leakiness, but greater reductions are necessary to slow blood vessel
growth. This defines differential responses of tumor blood
vessels dependent on the VEGF concentrations in tumors.
Our data support the use of mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors,
such as OSI-027 and OXA-01, to treat cancer as a single agent
or in combination with antiangiogenic agents. Sunitinib, an
approved multitargeted kinase inhibitor with potent antiVEGFR2 activity, has a toxicity profile necessitating a drug
holiday between dosing regimens. Vascular regrowth can

occur following cessation of VEGFR inhibition during drug
holidays (17). Our data indicate that OXA-01 treatment slowed
vessel regrowth after discontinuation of VEGFR inhibition.
Concurrent treatment of tumor xenografts with OSI-930 and
OXA-01 also resulted in significant downregulation of tumor
cell proliferation and upregulation of apoptosis. Furthermore,
combining sunitinib and OSI-027, provides greater inhibition
of tumor growth than either single agent. In human xenografts, a schedule of alternating sunitinib and OSI-027 treatment was tolerable, but did not provide better efficacy than
continuous single agent administration. Together, these
observations suggest that VEGFR2 and mTORC1/mTORC2
coinhibition targets both the tumor cells and vasculature,
resulting in significant tumor growth inhibition. Although the
precise mechanism is not clear, we hypothesize that increased
hypoxia resulting from VEGFR2 antagonism sensitizes tumor
cells to mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibition. Previous studies
showed hypoxia-induced VEGF production is attenuated by
Akt inhibition but not by rapamycin, suggesting mTORC2/Akt
signaling axis as a key effector under hypoxic conditions (43).
In addition, hypoxia activation of the mTORC2 effector, Akt,
protects cells from apoptosis (44–46). Our data indicates OXA01 but not rapamycin significantly inhibited Akt, and is a likely
mechanism for increased apoptosis and decreased tumor
growth following combined VEGFR2 and mTORC1/mTORC1
inhibition.
Rapalogs are approved for treatment of advanced renal cell
carcinoma. This study indicates that dual inhibition of

mTORC1/mTORC2 has more robust antitumor and antivascular effects compared to mTORC1 inhibition. Together, these
results indicate unique, therapeutically relevant properties of
OXA-01 and OSI-027 that are applicable for clinical development of these drugs for cancer treatment.
