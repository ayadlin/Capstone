ABSTRACT
Glioma cells release glutamate through expression of system xc-, which exchanges
intracellular glutamate for extracellular cysteine. Lack of the excitatory amino acid
transporter 2 (EAAT2) expression maintains high extracellular glutamate levels in the
glioma microenvironment, causing excitotoxicity to surrounding parenchyma. Not only
does this contribute to the survival and proliferation of glioma cells, but is involved in
the pathophysiology of tumour-associated epilepsy (TAE). We investigated the role of
the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist pioglitazone
in modulating EAAT2 expression in glioma cells. We found that EAAT2 expression
was increased in a dose dependent manner in both U87MG and U251MG glioma cells.
Extracellular glutamate levels were reduced with the addition of pioglitazone, where
statistical significance was reached in both U87MG and U251MG cells at a concentration
of ≥ 30 μM pioglitazone (p < 0.05). The PPARγ antagonist GW9662 inhibited the effect
of pioglitazone on extracellular glutamate levels, indicating PPARγ dependence. In
addition, pioglitazone significantly reduced cell viability of U87MG and U251MG cells
at ≥ 30 μM and 100 μM (p < 0.05) respectively. GW9662 also significantly reduced
viability of U87MG and U251MG cells with 10 μM and 30 μM (p < 0.05) respectively.
The effect on viability was partially dependent on PPARγ activation in U87MG cells but
not U251MG cells, whereby PPARγ blockade with GW9662 had a synergistic effect.
We conclude that PPARγ agonists may be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment
of gliomas and furthermore suggest a novel role for these agents in the treatment of
tumour associated seizures through the reduction in extracellular glutamate.

cysteine. [3] Intracellular uptake of cysteine via system
xc- permits glioma cell survival through glutathione
formation. Excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2)
is one of 5 subtypes of sodium dependent plasma
membrane glutamate transporters that accounts for up to
90% of extracellular glutamate uptake, with Glutamate
Aspartate Transporter (GLAST-1) accounting for the
largest remaining proportion. [4, 5] Glioma cell lines

INTRODUCTION
Glutamate is the most abundant neurotransmitter in
the mammalian central nervous system and mediates its
excitatory physiological effect by binding to ionotropic
and metabotropic receptors. [1, 2] Glioma cells release

lack expression of both EAAT2 and GLAST-1, which is
associated with impaired glutamate uptake. [3, 6] Together,
these features result in abnormally high extracellular
glutamate concentrations resulting in excitotoxicity,
causing necrosis of the adjacent parenchyma, which
creates space permitting proliferation. [7, 8] Additionally,
cysteine uptake provides a precursor for the formation
of glutathione, which is protective against endogenous
reactive oxygen species and further promotes glioma
growth. [7] Furthermore, deranged glutamate transport
has been associated with the pathogenesis of glial tumour
associated epilepsy (TAE). [9, 10]
PPARγ is a ligand-dependent transcription factor
that responds to both physiological and chemical stimuli,
including the cyclopentatone prostaglandin, 15-deoxy∆12, 14
prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and thiazolidinediones
(TDZ) respectively. [11] Expression of PPARγ in the
brain has been found in multiple cell types including
microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. It
has been shown in rat cortical cultures incubated with the
commercially available PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone, that
this drug increases the expression levels of EAAT2 at both
the protein and mRNA levels. [12] Furthermore, reduction
in the infarct volume after administration of rosiglitazone
in rats with middle cerebral artery occlusion demonstrated
in this study strongly supports the clinical evidence of
better neurological outcomes found in a small casematched controlled study investigating stroke recovery
with TDZ drugs. [12, 13]
Increased PPARγ expression has been associated
with beneficial effects in cancers including breast and
colon, including a reduction in cell proliferation and
improved patient prognoses. [14–17] In comparison to
other cancer cell lines, it has been observed that glioma
cells express lower endogenous levels of PPARγ. [18]
Nevertheless, there is a growing body of evidence that
demonstrates several mechanisms by which PPARγ
agonists elicit anti-neoplastic effects in gliomas.
Pioglitazone has been shown to reduce the expression
of β-catenin independently of PPARγ. [19] Others have
observed that the PPARγ agonist citaglitazone mediates
glioma cell apoptosis independently of PPARγ through
the reduction of Akt and induction of mitochondrial
membrane potential loss. [18] Citaglitazone has also been
shown to inhibit proliferation of brain tumour stem cells
and expression of stemness genes in de-differentiated
glioma cell lines. [20] Most recently, Grommes and
colleagues demonstrated the efficacy of pioglitazone in
reducing tumour growth with a human glioma xenograft
model, highlighting the ability of pioglitazone to cross the
blood brain barrier. [21]
Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) is a serine/
threonine protein kinase, which was first characterised in
1980 and is inactivated by phosphorylation at serine 21 in
GSK-3α or serine 9 in GSK3-β. [22, 23] PPARγ agonists
are known to be GSK3 inhibitors, which has been shown
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to have a neuroprotective role in stroke models through
the promotion of cell survival. [24, 25] Although active
GSK3 has been known to inhibit survival pathways, the
inhibition of GSK3 has been paradoxically shown to
be effective against several neoplasms. [26, 27] GSK3
inhibition in glioma stem cells has also been observed to
induce differentiation and regulate proliferation by Korur
and colleagues. [28]
As glioma cells express some PPARγ, we were
interested in the potential of PPARγ agonists in increasing
the expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT2.
Herein, we describe a novel mechanism of the PPARγ
agonist, pioglitazone, in which we demonstrate its
ability to increase EAAT2 expression and consequently
extracellular glutamate levels in glioma cells. In addition
we show that this agent alters cellular morphology, whilst
also reducing the viability of human glioblastoma cell
lines. These results warrant further investigation into the
potential role of this class of agents in both anti-neoplastic
and anti-convulsant therapy in gliomas.

RESULTS
Human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
cell lines express low levels of the glutamate
transporters EAAT2 and GLAST-1
We established the baseline expression of the
glutamate transporters EAAT2 and GLAST-1 (EAAT1)
in a number of glioma cell lines (U87MG, U251MG
and GSC #35) relative to rodent normal brain tissue as
a control. EAAT2 and GLAST-1 were expressed in low
levels in these cell lines in comparison to the rat brain
cortex and thalamus control tissues (Figure 1). This was
in keeping with previous literature results with respect to
EAAT2 and GLAST-1 basal expression levels observed
in U251MG and U87MG cells respectively. [6, 29]
Interestingly, we detected higher basal levels of PPARγ
in the glioma cells compared to the normal brain tissue
controls (Figure 1).

Pioglitazone increases expression of EAAT2
and PPARγ but not GLAST-1 in U87MG and
U251MG cells
To determine whether glutamate transporters in
glioma cells could be modulated with PPARγ agonists as
with astrocytes, we treated glioma cells with increasing
concentrations of pioglitazone. Incubating U87MG
and U251MG cell lines with pioglitazone resulted in a
dose dependent activation of EAAT2 and PPARγ but
not GLAST-1 protein expression (Figure 2). PPARγ
protein expression was also increased in this manner. We
confirmed that EAAT2 expression is unchanged in GSC
#35 by pioglitazone (Figure 3).

diminished when co-incubated with GW9662 at a
concentration of 10 μM or above (Figure 5(a)). Earlier
we showed that GW9662 alone significantly reduced
U87MG cell viability at the same concentrations, but
in combination with pioglitazone there was a reduced
effect compared to pioglitazone alone. U251MG cells
demonstrated an opposing phenomenon whereby
increasing doses of GW9662 resulted in a significant dose
dependent reduction in cellular viability (Figure 5(b)).

Concentrations of pioglitazone of 30 μM or above
resulted in a significant reduction in cell viability of
U87MG cells (Figure 4(a)). In U251MG glioma cells, a
significant reduction in cell viability was only observed
at a pioglitazone concentration of 100 μM (Figure 4(b)).
However, pioglitazone was not found to elicit cytotoxicity
in GSC #35 (Figure 6(a-h)).

Pioglitazone reduces extracellular glutamate
release from glioma cells

GW9662 reduces viability of GBM cell lines
U87MG cell viability was reduced significantly
when exposed to 10 μM or above of the PPARγ blocker
GW9662 (Figure 4(c)), whereas a reduction in U251MG
cell viability was observed at concentrations of 30 μM or
above (Figure 4(d)). GSC #35 did not demonstrate such
sensitivity to GW9662 (Figure 6(b–d)).

In order to elucidate whether glutamate uptake in
glioma cells is increased by any potential reduction in
glutamate transporters, we measured glutamate levels
in the glioma culture media. As the glioma cell lines
U87MG and U251MG were cultured in media containing
5% FCS, a high glutamate background was expected
as has been previously reported. [30] We determined
the background glutamate concentration in culture
medium was 34.16 μM ± 12.08 (data not shown). In
U87MG cells we observed a significant dose-dependent
reduction in extracellular glutamate levels with increasing
concentrations of pioglitazone ≥ 30 μM at 72 hours
(Figure 7(a)). A similar observation was made with

in protein expression, where increased EAAT2 expression
was highest at pioglitazone concentrations of 30 μM and
10 μM in U87MG and U251MG respectively (Figure
2(a) & (b)). These results suggest that pioglitazoneinduced upregulation of EAAT2 leads to increased
uptake of extracellular glutamate. These results were not
corroborated in GSC #35, where no significant change
in extracellular glutamate was elucidated (Figure 9(a)).
Although GW9662 was associated with a significant
reduction in glutamate in U87MG and U251MG cells at

these concentrations were associated with a significant
reduction in cell viability (Figure 4(c) & (d)).

Pioglitazone mediated reduction in extracellular
glutamate is PPARγ dependent
To confirm whether EAAT2 modulation in glioma
cells using pioglitazone was PPARγ dependent, the U87MG
and U251MG glioma cell lines were treated with GW9662
alone and co-administration of pioglitazone and GW9662.

compromised ability to form astrocytic processes (Figure 10).

a pioglitazone concentration of 100 μM (Figure 10). Glioma

reduced with the pioglitazone treatment but sphere size was

observations correlates well with viability results (Figure 12).

that ciglitazone treatment results in reduced phosphorylation
of Akt (Thr308), which is not altered by the presence of
the PPARγ inhibitor, GW9662. [18] We observed that in
U87MG cells treated with pioglitazone there was increased
expression of both phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated
GSK-3β with no change in the levels of total Akt or GSK3β (Figure 13(a)). In contrast, when treating U251MG cells
with pioglitazone, we did not detect a significant change
in the phosphorylation status of GSK-3β, although total
Akt protein levels were marginally reduced with 100 µM
pioglitazone (Figure 13(b)). This suggests that pioglitazone
operates through a different mechanism of apoptotic cell
death in glioma cells compared to ciglitazone.

Pioglitazone may alter Akt and GSK-3β activity
In order to understand how pioglitazone may reduce
cell viability in glioblastoma cell lines, we sought to
measure the expression of pertinent oncogenic signalling
cascades. Lee and colleagues have previously demonstrated

DISCUSSION

shown), indicating inactivation of GSK-3β. However, we
did not observe a correlation between Akt mediated GSK3β inactivating phosphorylation as reported by Atkins and
colleagues. [34] This implies that PPARγ agonists may
inactivate GSK-3β through other upstream mediators
alongside or independently through direct inhibition. [25]
The more noticeable reduction in astrocytic processes
formation in U251MG over U87MG cells may not
implicate GSK-3β inhibition as a downstream target of
PPARγ agonists, which has been previously shown with
lithium chloride of U87MG cells. [35] We also did not
detect an association of pioglitazone mediated EAAT2
expression or the activation state of GSK-3β. In addition
GSK3 inhibition by pioglitazone may also prevent the
formation of neurospheres (Figures 11 & 12), corroborating
previous findings by Korur and colleagues. [28] Wan and
colleagues previously demonstrated that pioglitazone
significantly reduces viability of U87MG and U251MG
cells at concentrations of 100 μM and 200 μM beyond 72
hours. [19] Our results demonstrate that pioglitazone may
be more potent in this role as we observed a significant
reduction in cell viability at concentrations of ≥ 30 μM
in U87MG and 100 μM in U251MG as early as 24 hours.
In order to determine whether the observed effects
on viability and EAAT2 modulation relied on PPARγ
activation, the inhibitor GW9662 was used as previously
described in studies utilising breast tumours and glioma
cell lines. [18, 36] In our current study, GW9662 alone
reduced cell viability of U87MG and U251MG cells at
concentrations of at least 10 and 30 μM, respectively. A
potential anti-neoplastic pathway for GW9662 is through
the reduced expression of Fatty Acid Binding Protein 7
(FABP7), which has been implicated as a target gene for
PPAR. [37] Authors of this study demonstrated a reduction
in cellular migration after siRNA knockdown of FABP7
and the PPAR antagonist treatment of GSCs with and
without irradiation. This potentially contradicts previous
findings that PPARγ agonists induce apoptosis in GSCs,
however the effect of PPARγ agonists on FABP7 has yet
to be thoroughly investigated. [38] Furthermore, these two
studies differ in the use of primary and enriched long-term
GSC lines, which may explain the differences to previous
studies.
We observed no change in EAAT2 expression in
glioma stem cell line #035 with pioglitazone exposure,
which may be in keeping with a lineage specific GSC
as shown by Pollard and Colleagues. [39] Extracellular
glutamate levels were not raised in the culture medium
from GSC #35 and pioglitazone treatment did not augment
this (Figure 9). Interestingly, Gilley and colleagues found
that neural stem cells derived from the hippocampal
dentate gyrus exhibited raised EAAT2 expression in
hypoxic-ischaemic and traumatic brain injury rodent
models. [40] Furthermore, these authors showed that
siRNA knockdown of EAAT1 and EAAT2 resulted in
an increase in neurosphere formation and proliferation,

Our study provides evidence that the PPARγ
agonist pioglitazone increases the functional expression
of the glutamate transporter EAAT2 in glioma cells. This
represents a potential novel mechanism for treatment of
glioma associated seizures, whereby excess extracellular
glutamate is transported back into glioma cells and also
by normal astrocytes at the peritumoural edge. This is a
potentially therapeutic approach by preventing glutamate
mediated seizures and excitotoxic damage. In light of
the findings by Romera and colleagues that PPARγ
agonists increase astrocytic EAAT2 and subsequently
reduce extracellular glutamate, which we show that
PPARγ-mediated EAAT2 modulation is also applicable
to glioma cells. [32] We did not carry out a glutamate
uptake assay, which would be important to confirm true
functional upregulation. [6] However, cell viability was
not significantly reduced at the effective concentration of
30 μM of pioglitazone in U251MG glioma cells reported
here, providing a surrogate for EAAT2 function. Whether
pioglitazone also affects glutamate release, glutamate
uptake or both requires further investigation.
De Groot and colleagues previously demonstrated that
overexpression of EAAT2 in glioma cell lines, including
U87MG and U251MG glioma cells, resulted in a reduced
ability to form tumours and also caused in vivo and in vitro
apoptosis. [29] Pioglitazone induced EAAT2 upregulation
may play a role in reducing glioma cell viability via
multiple mechanisms, particularly through the activation of
caspase-3, which has been shown in both overexpression
studies and cellular apoptosis assays. [29, 33]
Deactivation of oncogenic mediators such as Akt
and β-catenin has been implicated as possible PPARγ
independent mechanisms for PPARγ agonists. [18, 19]
We observed a reduction in total Akt protein expression
levels in U251MG glioma cells following treatment with
50 and 100 μM of pioglitazone. This was in contrast to the
increase in Akt protein expression detected in U87MG cells,
where Akt phosphorylation at the threonine 473 (thr308)
residue was unchanged in U251MG cells but increased in
U87MG cells (Figure 13). Lee and colleagues observed
that a concentration of 30 μM pioglitazone effectively
reduced total Akt activity and phosphorylation at threonine
308 (thr308) residue, but not ser473 in T98G cells after 48
hours. [18] The increased phosphorylation of Akt thr308 was
not seen to significantly reduce cell viability when cells
were incubated with pioglitazone. Reduction in Akt activity
is desirable to counteract mutations in RTK/PTEN/PI3K in
gliomas that lead to increased Akt activity downstream,
resulting in uncontrolled proliferation.
We discovered that GSK-3β expression levels were
decreased with a corresponding increase in GSK-3α
and GSK-3β phosphorylation on ser21 and ser9 residues,
respectively, in U87MG cells treated with pioglitazone
(Figure 13) but not in U251MG after 72 hours (data not

whereas overexpression had the converse effect. This
mirrors our findings, which showed that GSC #035 does
not express EAAT1 or 2 and there was reduced formation
of glioma stem-like neurospheres with increasing
concentrations of pioglitazone. This raises important
questions about how GSCs survive in a microenvironment
that is rich in glutamate. It could be the case that this
alters their proliferative ability, which may ultimately be
involved in selecting a subpopulation of GSCs. Our data
from one GSC line suggests that such cells can release low
levels of glutamate around 10 μM (data not shown).
The morphological effects of pioglitazone on glioma
cells has not been previously reported. Herein we have
shown that pioglitazone treatment alters the morphology
of U87MG, U251MG glioma cells and a primary GSC
line in a concentration dependent manner. However, the
observed changes in cell morphology did not correlate with
cell viability. U87MG morphology notably changed in the
presence of 100 μM pioglitazone but cell viability was
significantly reduced at concentrations of 30 μM and above.
GW9662, an inhibitor of PPARγ demonstrated opposing
effects in combination with a cytostatic dose of pioglitazone,
which may be due to PPARγ independent effects of the two
drugs working synergistically as reported elsewhere. [13].
Bright and colleagues previously demonstrated the
efficacy of the more potent PPARγ agonist ciglitazone
on CD133+ U87MG and T98G neurospheres. [38] A
cytotoxicity assay on our GSC line #35 with increasing
concentrations of pioglitazone did not corroborate these
findings (Figure 6(a)–6(h)). However, our GSC line was
not de-differentiated from established cell lines, rather
isolated from a primary resection. Furthermore, there
may be unexplored PPARγ-independent mechanistic
differences between pioglitazone and ciglitazone that are
not accounted by the class effect of these drugs.
Owing to the established association between
glutamate and tumour associated epilepsy, there may also
exist a novel role for PPARγ agonists. [9, 10] Notably,
we chose the U251MG cell line since Buckingham and
colleagues previously utilised this in establishing a tumour
associated epilepsy model in rodents. [10] Although
pioglitazone is associated with a minor risk of bladder
cancer, it is otherwise a relatively safe drug that could be
considered for clinical trials. [41] Alternatively, 293 agents
that upregulate EAAT2 protein expression in primary
astrocytes have been identified with high throughput
screening, providing a new family of candidate drugs that
are available to be tested for this treatment strategy. [42]
Currently, the only promising drug candidate for
tumour associated epilepsy has been sulfasalazine. [10]
Extensive clinical trials have yet to follow, but a previous
clinical trial suggests potential challenges with this agent.
[43] Sattler and colleagues have recently demonstrated
that thiamphenicol, through its upregulation of EAAT2
in peritumoural tissue, may be similarly beneficial. [44]
PPARγ agonists may constitute an additional agent that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activates glutamate transport within tumour cells and
peritumourally. These agents could be considered for
adjunct treatment in current regimens and in combination
therapy for dual mechanistic efficacy in sub therapeutic
doses to avoid associated adverse effects.

on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), transferred onto
polyvinyldene fluoride membrane and probed with the
indicated primary antibodies. The signal was visualised
using the ECL chemilluminescence detection kit (GE
Healthcare, Rydelmere, N.S.W., Australia) following
incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies.

Preparation of rodent brain samples
Non-epileptic control Wistar rats were used for
control samples and were obtained from our own breeding
colony (Biological Resource Facility, RMH Academic
Centre). All procedures were approved by the University
of Melbourne Animal Ethics Committee (AEC #1111944)
and performed in accordance with the guidelines published
by the Australian NHMRC for use of animals in research.
Seven day old Wistar rat pups were culled and
samples of cortex and thalamus were stored on dry ice.
Whole cell lysates were prepared in erythrocyte lysis
buffer (ELB) (500 mM NaCl, 100 mM HEPES, and 10
mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton X100, 20 mM NaF, 2 mM NaV, 2
μg/mL aprotonin). The whole cell lysates were clarified by
centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4oC for 10 minutes.

High performance liquid chromatography
Glutamate analysis in cell culture media was performed
using the isocratic HPLC method which utilises naphthalene-2,
3-dicarboxyaldehyde derivatisation (NDA) and subsequent
fluorescence detection as previously described. [46]

Statistics
All statistical analysis and graph generation was
performed using the software package GraphPad Prism
5.0, La Jolla, CA, USA. The unpaired Student’s t-test was
used to compare groups and statistical significance was
considered to be p ≤ 0.05.

Photomicroscopy and quantification of cell
morphology

CONCLUSIONS

ImageJ (ver. 1. 48, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland) was
utilised to measure cellularity, formation of astrocytic
processes, and neurosphere formation and size. Cellularity
was measured by converting images to a binary format and
using processing tools to demarcate cells for automated
counting. Average area of neurospheres was used to estimate
the size of neurosphere formation. Astrocytic processes were
measured manually using binary processes in ImageJ.

The PPARγ agonist pioglitazone increases functional
EAAT2 expression and reduces extracellular glutamate levels
in both U87MG and U251MG glioma cells. Pioglitazone alters
the cell morphology and reduces cell viability of the glioma
cell lines, U87MG and U251MG. Pioglitazone and other
PPARγ agonists may offer a novel treatment paradigm for
the treatment of TAE through the promotion of extracellular
glutamate clearance at both the glioma cell level and
surrounding astrocytes. Further work is required to definitively
elucidate the mechanisms of this therapeutic strategy.

Drug treatment of cell lines
Pioglitazone hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) and GW9662 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) were
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at –20oC
until use. Glioma cells were treated at a number of drug
concentrations and times as indicated in the results section.
