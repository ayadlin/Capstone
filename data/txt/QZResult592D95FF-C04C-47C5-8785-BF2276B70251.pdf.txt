ABSTRACT
We previously reported that Sildenafil enhances apoptosis and antitumor efficacy
of doxorubicin (DOX) while attenuating its cardiotoxic effect in prostate cancer. In
the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which sildenafil sensitizes
DOX in killing of prostate cancer (PCa) cells, DU145. The death receptor Fas (APO-1
or CD95) induces apoptosis in many carcinoma cells, which is negatively regulated
by anti-apoptotic molecules such as FLIP (Fas-associated death domain (FADD)
interleukin-1-converting enzyme (FLICE)-like inhibitory protein). Co-treatment of
PCa cells with sildenafil and DOX for 48 hours showed reduced expression of both
long and short forms of FLIP (FLIP-L and -S) as compared to individual drug treatment.
Over-expression of FLIP-s with an adenoviral vector attentuated the enhanced cellkilling effect of DOX and sildenafil. Colony formation assays also confirmed that FLIP-S
over-expression inhibited the DOX and sildenafil-induced synergistic killing effect as
compared to the cells infected with an empty vector. Moreover, siRNA knock-down
of CD95 abolished the effect of sildenafil in enhancing DOX lethality in cells, but had
no effect on cell killing after treatment with a single agent. Sildenafil co-treatment
with DOX inhibited DOX-induced NF-κB activity by reducing phosphorylation of IκB
and nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit, in addition to down regulation of FAP1 (Fas associated phosphatase-1, a known inhibitor of CD95-mediated apoptosis)
expression. This data provides evidence that the CD95 is a key regulator of sildenafil
and DOX mediated enhanced cell death in prostate cancer.

cells lines in culture, including colonic adenocarcinoma
(SW480, HCT116, HT29, T84), breast cancer (HTB26, MCF-7), lung cancer, bladder and prostate cancer
(LNCAP, PC-3), and leukemia [6–8]. All forms of
prostate cancer therapy cause significant risk of ED due
to trauma sustained by the cavernosal nerves [9]. PDE5
inhibitors have been shown to improve erectile function
post-radical prostatectomy [10–13]. Our laboratory first
demonstrated that co-treatment with sildenafil potentiates
antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX) in prostate
cancer, which was mediated by enhanced generation of
ROS, up-regulation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities,
reduced expression of Bcl-xL, and phosphorylation of Bad

INTRODUCTION
Sildenafil citrate (Viagra), a highly selective
inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5
(PDE5), is used clinically for treating erectile dysfunction
(ED) and pulmonary hypertension. Several studies have
shown that PDE5 expression is increased in multiple
human carcinomas including metastatic breast cancers,
colon adenocarcinoma, bladder squamous carcinoma,
and lung cancers as compared to adjacent normal tissues
[1–6], suggesting its potential role in controlling tumor
cell growth and death. PDE5 was also detected as a
predominant isoform of cGMP-PDEs in many carcinoma

[14]. Sildenafil also potentiated DOX-induced killing of
androgen independent human prostate cancer cells and
inhibited tumor growth in mice bearing prostate tumor
xenografts [14].
Despite its clinical efficacy, the use of DOX is
limited by a dose-dependent delayed and progressive
cardiomyopathy often observed several years after
cessation of treatment [15;16]. A great deal of effort has
been expended in preventing or mitigating the cardiotoxic
side effects of DOX without reducing the antitumor
efficacy or causing additional toxic effects. Our study in
mice bearing prostate tumor xenografts also confirmed
that sildenafil and DOX combination ameliorated DOXinduced cardiac dysfunction, which is consistent with
our previous study showing improved left ventricular
(LV) function with PDE5 inhibitors in DOX-treated mice
[17;18].
Recent studies suggest that Fas/Apo-1/CD95, a
member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor
superfamily, is a potential anti-cancer factor as it can
induce apoptosis in tumor cells [19]. Prior studies
from our laboratories have demonstrated that sildenafil
enhances the cytotoxicities of multiple well-established
chemotherapeutic drugs [14;20-22]. Sildenafil potentiated
chemotherapy killing through activation of the CD95
death receptor pathway, generation of reactive oxygen
species, and mitochondrial dysfunction in gastrointestinal/
genitourinary cancers, hepatoma, colorectal cancer,
glioblastoma, medulloblastoma cells and breast cancer
cells [20–22]. However, the role of CD95 in sildenafilinduced enhanced toxicity of DOX in prostate cancer is
not known. In addition, despite the fact that Fas/CD95
is expressed in many cancer cells, some tumors, such as
prostate cancer, display resistance to Fas-induce apoptosis
due to the decreased expression of Fas in a large fraction
of prostate cancer [23]. By contrast, the expression of
FLIP (FLICE-like inhibitory protein), an inhibitor of Fasmediated apoptosis, was strong in most cases of prostate
cancer [23]. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to
identify the central mechanism of sildenafil-induced
enhanced chemotherapeutic efficacy of DOX in prostate
cancer. We hypothesized that CD95/FLIP may be the
key regulators in sildenafil and DOX mediated killing of
prostate cancer cells.

FLIP-L and -S compared to control and DOX alone.
Immunohistochemistry also confirmed the reduction of
the expression of FLIP following sildenafil and DOX cotreatment (Figure 2).

Role of FLIP in synergistic killing effect of
sildenafil and DOX co-treatment
FLIP-s was overexpressed in DU145 cells by
adenoviral infection (Figure 3 upper panel). cell death
assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay confirmed that
sildenafil potentiated DOX-induced cell killing in cells
infected with control virus (Ad-CMV). The overexpression
of FLIP-s inhibited the additive cell killing effect of
sildenafil as compared to DOX alone (Figure 3). DOXinduced cell death was increased with sildenafil cotreatment from 19.4±2.3% to 43.1±3.5% in adeno-CMV
infected cells (P<0.05). In cells overexpressing FLIP-s,
sildenafil co-treatment also increased DOX-induced cell
death from 18.2±1.1% to 26.5±1.6% although said increase
was not as high as adeno-CMV infected cells. Colony
formation assays performed using median dose effect
isobologram analysis also showed the overexpression
of FLIP-s inhibited the DOX and sildenafil-induced
synergistic killing of DU145 cells (Table 1) with CI >1.

CD95 knock-down abolishes the enhanced cell
killing effect of DOX and sildenafil co-treatment
Immunohistochemistry showed enhanced cell surface
localization of CD95 protein in DU145 cells following
DOX treatment (Figure 4). Sildenafil co-treatment further
enhanced the cell surface localization of CD95. Since the
loss of CD95 expression is common in tumors from patients
with metastatic/advanced cancer, we examined whether
sildenafil could enhance DOX-toxicity in DU145 cells
with reduced CD95 function. Western blot confirmed the
knock-down of CD95 expression in DU145 cells by siRNA
CD95 (Figure 5 upper panel). Cell death assessed by trypan
blue exclusion assay confirmed that sildenafil potentiated
DOX-induced cell killing in scramble siRNA transfected
DU145 cells; however, knock-down of CD95 abolished the
simulated cell killing effect of sildenafil compared to DOX
alone (Figure 5). DOX-induced cell death was increased
with sildenafil co-treatment from 39.2±2.4 to 68.6±3.8% in
scramble siRNA transfected cells (P<0.05). Sildenafil cotreatment did not significantly increase DOX-induced cell
death in DU145 cells transfected with siRNA CD95, i.e.,
from 34.8±3.2% to 40.9±2.0%.

DOX further stimulated the active form of caspase-8

DOX significantly increased NFκB activity compared
to control and sildenafil alone (Figure 8A). However,
sildenafil co-treatment with DOX significantly reduced
NFκB activity as compared to DOX alone. DOX also
induced the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit
from cytosol compared to control (Figure 8B).
Sildenafil co-treatment with DOX reduced p65 nuclear
translocation as compared to DOX alone. Moreover,
nuclear translocation of p50 was slightly enhanced by
DOX, which was blocked with sildenafil co-treatment.
Phosphorylation of IκB was also induced with DOX
treatment which was reduced by sildenafil co-treatment
(Figure 8C).

DISCUSSION

cardioprotective benefits [14]. In bladder cancer cells, as
well as pancreatic cancer cells, we showed that sildenafil
enhanced the lethality of mitomycin C, doxorubicin,
cisplatin, and gemcitabine via activation of CD95 [20].
In the present study, we further investigated the molecular
events of CD95-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer
cells following combination therapy with DOX and
sildenafil. Our results show that CD95 plays a critical role
in enhancing apoptosis by combination treatment with
sildenafil and DOX in prostate cancer cells, DU145.
One major regulator of CD95-mediated apoptosis
at the DISC level is c-FLIP [29]. Multiple splice variants
of c-FLIP have been reported but so far only a 26 kDa
short form (c-FLIPs), a 24 kDa form (c-FLIPR) and a 55
kDa long form (c-FLIPL) could be detected at protein
level [30;31]. The inhibition of apoptosis by c-FLIPL has
been shown to be through recruitment to and cleavage

The death receptor Fas (APO-1/CD95) induces
apoptosis in many tissues upon cross-linking by its ligand
(FasL), but a number of cancer cells exhibit resistance
to Fas induced apoptosis. In fact, prostate cancer is
resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis despite high levels
of Fas surface expression and no mutation in the Fas
gene [24–26]. Suppression of apoptotic signaling seems
to be one of the hallmarks of cancer that is regulated by
specific genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, including the
down-regulation of Fas death receptor [27;28]. Therefore,
it is clinically important to understand the underlying
mechanisms by which cancer cells acquire such resistance.
Our previous study demonstrated a potential utility of
sildenafil in enhancing the chemotherapeutic efficacy of
DOX in prostate cancer while simultaneously providing

in the DISC, because c-FLIPL induces a conformation
of procaspase-8 that allows partial but not complete
proteolytical processing of the caspase-8 molecule.
Recruitment of c-FLIPS to the DISC prevents caspase-8
cleavage completely [32]. Several studies reported that
high expression of FLIP promotes tumor growth and

facilitates immune escape of tumors [30;33]. Ectopic
overexpression of c-FLIP accelerated progression to
androgen independent growth by inhibiting apoptosis
in LNCaP prostate tumors implanted in nude mice [34].
Down-regulation of FLIP confers not only sensitivity to
Fas-induced apoptosis but also to chemotherapy-induced

apoptosis in various tumor models [35;36]. In addition,
down-regulation of FLIP has been shown to sensitize
breast cancer cells to DOX-induced apoptosis [37]. Our
prior studies showed that overexpression of BCL-xL
and c-FLIP-s suppressed synergetic effect of sildenafil
and other chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g. vincristine/
etoposide/cisplatin) in medulloblastoma cells [22]. In
the present study, we observed that the expression of
c-FLIPL and c-FLIPs were reduced in DU145 cells with
sildenafil and DOX co-treatment as compared to DOX
alone and control. Moreover, overexpression of c-FLIPs
blocked the enhanced cell killing effect of sildenafil with
DOX co-treatment as compared to DOX alone. A colony

forming assay forming assay further confirmed that
overexpression of c-FLIPs blocked the synergistic effect of
sildenafil and DOX in enhancing cell killing. Our results
suggest that the reduction of c-FLIP by combination
treatment with sildenafil and DOX could be a potential
molecular intervention in induction of apoptotic cell death
in prostate cancer.
The level of cell surface expression of CD95 is a
critical parameter in determining the capability cells to
undergo apoptosis. CD95 tyrosine phosphorylation is an
essential step for CD95-activation, subsequent membrane
targeting and apoptosis induction [38]. In the present
study, CD95 cell surface localization was increased

after DOX treatment, and sildenafil co-treatment further
enhanced this effect. Moreover, the knock-down of CD95
with siRNA abolished the simulated cell killing effect of
sildenafil as compared to DOX alone. Taken together,
this data indicates a potential role of CD95 in enhanced
cytotoxicity of prostate cancer cells by co-treatment with
sildenafil and DOX. These results are consistent with a
previous study showing significantly reduced synergistic
effect of sildenafil and COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib in
human glioma cell with over-expression of c-FLIP-s or
knock down of CD95/FADD [21].
CD95 stimulation leads to the formation of
death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) on the cell
membrane through recruitment of Fas-associated death
domain-containing protein (FADD) to the intracellular
death domain (DD) of CD95 receptor [39]. In DISC, the
death effector domain (DED) of FADD interacts with
the N-terminal tandem DEDs of procaspases-8, -10,
and c-FLIP, which leads to autoproteolytical cleavage
and activation of caspase-8 [40]. In the cleavage steps
of procaspase-8, the active enzyme subunits p18, p10,
and the prodomains p26/p24 are produced. Finally the
active caspase-8 heterotetramer p102-p182 is released
into the cytosol to stimulate the apoptotic signal. In the
present study, through immunoprecipitation of protein
with CD95 and immunoblotting with caspase-8, we
confirmed that the active formats of caspase 8 (p26/p24
and p18) are increased after sildenafil co-treatment with
DOX compared to control and DOX alone. This data
suggests that co-treatment of sildenafil and DOX induces
caspase-8 activation by stimulating CD95 in prostate
cancer cells.

The protein-tyrosine phosphatase FAP-1/PTP-Bas/
PTPN13 interacts with human Fas protein (CD95) and
prevents its export from the cytoplasm to the cell surface
in cancer cells [41–43]. FAP-1 has been reported to
dephosphorylate CD95 on Tyr291- a site important for the
receptor to internalize and to signal apoptosis [28;41;4447] while also rendering cells resistant to CD95-mediated
apoptosis [42;48]. FAP-1 overexpression correlates with
the resistance of some human malignant cells to Fasmediated apoptosis [41]. Ivanov et al. (2006) demonstrated
that FAP-1 expression is transcriptionally up-regulated
by NF-κB, a major antiapoptotic transcription factor that
restricts Fas protein trafficking to the cell surface thereby,
facilitating the survival of cancer cells [28]. The presence
of the putative NF-κB-binding elements are recognized
in the promoter region of the FAP-1 gene [49;50]. NFκB dependent regulation of the Fas gene is also well
established [51;52]. It has been reported that some
chemotherapeutic agents, including DOX, induce the
activation of NF-κB in cancer cells that inhibits apoptosis
and promotes cancer growth and are also responsible in
part for drug resistance in cancer cells [53–55]. Therefore,
targeted inactivation of NF-κB without systemic toxicity
in combination with chemotherapeutic agents may
increase the efficacy of cancer cell killing. Interestingly,
IκBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB, is also a substrate for FAP1, which dephosphorylates IκBα at Tyr 42, and renders
subsequent phosphorylation and its ubiquitination [56],
which in turn, allows the p65 subunit translocation to
nucleus and NF-κB activation. In head and neck cancer,
treatment with phosphatase inhibitor or silencing of FAP1 abolishes their resistance to apoptosis, suggesting that

to immunoprecipitated with rabbit CD95 antibody. The amount of co-immunoprecipitating caspase 8 was determined after SDS-PAGE and

FAP-1 activity could be responsible for NF-κB activation
and resistance of cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis [57].
The present study also showed that sildenafil cotreatment with DOX reduced the expression of FAP-1 in
DU145 cells. DOX significantly increased the activity of
NF-κB by inducing nuclear translocation of p65 subunit
in DU145 cells. However, DOX-induced activation of
NF-κB and nuclear translocation of p65 are inhibited
following sildenafil co-treatment with DOX. Moreover,

IκBα phosphorylation is also reduced which leads to a
reduction of nuclear translocation of p65 and p50. Previous
studies show that NF-κB transcriptionally up-regulates the
expression of c-FLIP, which inhibits caspase-8 activation
and the Bcl-2 family of proteins, including Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and
Bcl-xL, and counteract the action of pro-apoptotic proteins
including Bid, Bad, and Bax the action of pro-apoptotic
proteins including Bid, Bad, and Bax [58–60]. Therefore, we
suggest that sildenafil abolishes DOX–induced activation of

MATERIALS AND METHODS

NF-κB, which also down-regulates FAP-1 and c-FLIP and
stimulates CD95-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.
Decreased expression or functional mutation of Fas
has been found in various malignant tumors, which impairs
apoptotic signal transduction and leads to progression of
cancer [61;62]. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms
have been identified in the promoter region of the FAS
gene, including the substitution of A to G at position
−670 (FAS −670A/G) [63]. A recent meta-analysis study
identified a significant association among Fas-670 A/G
polymorphism with the risk of prostate cancer as well as the
impairment of tumor cells sensitivity to apoptosis signaling
[64;65]. The present study identified the essential role of
CD95 in enhancing apoptosis by combination therapy with
sildenafil and DOX in prostate cancer cells. Therefore,
prostate cancer patients with Fas-670 A/G polymorphism
may be resistant to this combination therapy.
In conclusion, the present study has identified
a novel mechanism of synergistic cell death with
sildenafil and DOX in prostate cancer cells which
involves increased surface localization of CD95, with
concomitant inactivation of NF-κB and suppression
of FLIP and FAP-1 expression (Figure 9). These
mechanistic studies may contribute to the expanding
use of PDE5 inhibitors in enhancing chemotherapeutic
efficacy in prostate cancer, but not in tumors lacking
CD95 expression.

Treatment of prostate cancer cells
Human prostate carcinoma (PCa) cells, DU145
(American Type Culture Collection), were grown in
Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium with 10 % FBS
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2 atmosphere
at 37oC. Cell were treated with DOX (0.5 µM) and /or
sildenafil (10 µM) in complete growth medium.

Cell death assay
Cells were treated with DOX and/or sildenafil for 24
hr in 6-well plate. After trypsinization, cell were stained
with trypan blue and counted under microscope (Nikon
Eclipse Ti-S).

Knockdown of CD95 and overexpression of
FLIP-s
Cells were transfected with scramble RNA (siSCR
as control) or siRNA to knockdown CD95 (purchased from
Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or infected with adenoviral vector
to overexpress FLIP-s (Vector Biolabs, Philadelphia, PA).
After knockdown of CD95 or overexpression of FLIP-s
(24 hr), cells were treated with sildenaifl and/or DOX.

Synergy of cell killing

Following treatment with DOX and/or sildenafil,
cells on slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells
were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells
were blocked with 2% goat serum in PBS and incubated
with anti-rabbit CD95 or rabbit FLIP-s and mouse tubulin
antibodies for 2 hr at RT. Slides were rinsed with PBS
and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit
IgG (Molecular Probes) and Alexa 555-conjugated antimouse IgG (Molecular Probes), then examined by Nikon
D-Eclipse C1 confocal microscope.

The synergy of killing by sildenafil and DOX was
analyzed by colony formation assays using median dose
effect isobologram analysis [14]. Briefly, DU145 cells
were plated as single cells (250–1,500 cells/well) in
sextuplicate. The cells were infected with an Ad.CMV
or Ad.c-FLIPs adenovirus after 18 hours of plating. After
24 hours, cells were treated with doxorubicin (DOX,
0.5–1.5 μM), or/ with sildenafil (5–15 uM), at a fixed
concentration ratio to perform median dose effect analyses
for the determination of synergy. After drug exposure

co-treatment with doxorubicin (DOX) inhibited DOX-induced enhanced expression of FLIP and activation of NFκB, which led to inhibition
of FAP-1, activation of CD95 and the formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) on the cell membrane through recruitment of
Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) to the intracellular death domain (DD) of CD95 receptor. FADD contains another
protein–protein interaction domain, termed the death effector domain (DED), which is required for the recruitment of caspases to the DISC.

Total soluble protein was extracted from treated cells
with cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15
min under 4oC and the supernatant was recovered. Fifty
micrograms of protein from each sample were separated
by SDS/PAGE and transferred on to a nitrocellulose
membrane. The membrane was incubated with various
primary antibodies against different proteins (CD95, FLIP,
FAP-1, pIκB or IκB, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers
MA, or Actin, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, TX)
at a dilution of 1:1,000. The membrane was washed and
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody (1:2,000 dilutions). The blots were developed
using a chemiluminescent system (Amersham ECL Plus;
GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Pittsburgh, PA). Subcellular
localization of p65 and p50 were determined by separating
nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins from DU145 cells after
48 h of treatment with DOX (0.5 µM) and/or Sild (10
µM) using nuclear extraction kits (Abcam, MA). Proteins
were then separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred on to
a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated
with p65 and p50 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers MA).

Immunoprecipitation
Total protein was extracted from treated cells with
RIPA buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 g for
15 min under 4oC and the supernatant was recovered. Total
protein (400 µg) was subjected to immunoprecipitation by a
rabbit CD95 antibody. The amount of co-immunoprecipitating
caspase-8 was determined after SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting with mouse caspase-8 (active format) and FADD
antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers MA)
