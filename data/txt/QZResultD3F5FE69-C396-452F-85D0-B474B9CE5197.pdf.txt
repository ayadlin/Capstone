Abstract
Leukemia encompasses several hematological malignancies with shared
phenotypes that include rapid proliferation, abnormal leukocyte self-renewal, and
subsequent disruption of normal hematopoiesis. While communication between
leukemia cells and the surrounding stroma supports tumor survival and expansion, the
mechanisms underlying direct leukemia cell-cell communication and its contribution
to tumor growth are undefined. Gap junctions are specialized intercellular connections
composed of connexin proteins that allow free diffusion of small molecules and ions
directly between the cytoplasm of adjacent cells. To characterize homotypic leukemia
cell communication, we employed in vitro models for both acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and measured gap junction function
through dye transfer assays. Additionally, clinically relevant gap junction inhibitors,
carbenoxolone (CBX) and 1-octanol, were utilized to uncouple the communicative
capability of leukemia cells. Furthermore, a qRT-PCR screen revealed several connexins
with higher expression in leukemia cells compared with normal hematopoietic stem
cells. Cx25 was identified as a promising adjuvant therapeutic target, and Cx25 but
not Cx43 reduction via RNA interference reduced intercellular communication and
sensitized cells to chemotherapy. Taken together, our data demonstrate the presence
of homotypic communication in leukemia through a Cx25-dependent gap junction
mechanism that can be exploited for the development of anti-leukemia therapies.

Introduction

among children, accounting for almost 1 out of 3 pediatric
cancers [1]. Additionally, while the term “leukemia” is
used to describe the four major types of leukemia, acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML), these diseases share several
defining features such as uncontrolled proliferation and
self-renewal of immature lymphoblasts or myeloblasts

Leukemia consists of a broad diagnostic category of
hematological malignancies that are estimated to account
for over 52,000 new cancer diagnoses in the United States,
resulting in over 24,000 deaths annually [1]. Leukemia
mainly affects the adult population, with a median age
of 66 at diagnosis, but is also the most common cancer

one connexin. Six individual connexin proteins may
co-oligomerize with the same (homomeric) or mixed
(heteromeric) connexins into connexons, or hemichannels,
although only certain combinations are possible [16]. Two
hemichannels are then able to come together, forming
homotypic or heterotypic gap junction channels between
contacting cells, depending on connexon isotype, that
facilitate cell-cell communication through the direct
transfer of small molecules up to 1 kDa such as Ca2+,
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and inositol
triphosphate (IP3) [17].
The importance and variable nature of cell-cell
communication in cancer has only recently begun to be
carefully investigated, and as a result, current clinical
models do not fully appreciate or take into account the
effects this may have on the tumor phenotype. Given
that many advanced cancers such as breast, prostate, and
leukemia often present as histologically dense entities,
it is reasonable to consider that cell-cell communication
occurs and is able to confer a survival advantage to tumor
cells. Additionally, while current therapies are effective
at eradicating rapidly dividing cells, they have no way
of distinguishing friend from foe, and many of the sideeffects associated with treatment are the direct result of
normal cell death. Therefore, the identification of tumorspecific gap junction function is paramount to develop
effective, complimentary anti-tumor therapies aimed at
removing malignant tissue while sparing normal healthy
tissue. In the current study, we demonstrate that direct
cell-cell communication between leukemia cells occurs,
in part due to a Cx25-dependent mechanism that enables
enhanced tumor cell proliferation and allows for the
identification of additional potential specific gap junction
protein functions as targets for anti-tumor therapy.

that subsequently interfere with normal hematopoiesis.
Clinically, patients present with symptoms such as
anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, which are
dominant throughout treatment. The standard of care for
leukemia includes chemotherapy, radiation, or both in
combination often followed by autologous or allogenic
stem cell transplantation [2]. While progress has been
made in recent years toward understanding the underlying
molecular mechanisms of leukemia, the average five-year
survival rate is 57% in the United States and is largely
dependent on the patient’s age at diagnosis, gender, race,
and type of leukemia [3].
The hematopoietic microenvironment is critical in
the initiation and progression of leukemia [4]. The bone
marrow niche comprises a heterogeneous population of
hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic stromal cells as well
as their extracellular products and cytokines. These cells
produce a variety of different extracellular matrix (ECM)
molecules including numerous interstitial and basal lamina
collagens. In the close confines of the bone marrow, cellcell and cell-ECM communication plays a large role in
promoting hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) survival,
expansion, and differentiation [5]. These interactions are
also thought to be essential for the tumorigenesis and
progression of leukemia. Recently, evidence has shown
that direct contact of leukemia cells with the surrounding
stroma inhibits their apoptosis and enhances their survival
following chemotherapy [6]. Leukemia cells have also
been shown to communicate with endothelial cells via
exosomal miRNA [7] and may contribute to the angiogenic
activity of endothelial cells, suggesting that cytoplasmic
signals originating in one cell type are capable of entering
another while impacting the phenotype in the recipient
cell. However, there has been little evidence for the
mechanism of direct homotypic communication between
individual leukemia cells themselves and the implications
this may cause for clinical treatment.
A common means for intercellular signals to quickly
travel between two adjacent cells is through gap junctionmediated mechanisms. Gap junction communication
is present in virtually all solid tissues and has been
demonstrated to be essential for normal embryonic
development [8], electric coupling in cardiac muscle
[9], and neurons [10], and for normal hematopoiesis
[11]. Additionally, connexin expression in non-excitable
tissues has key roles in organ development [12], skeletal
development and function [13], and growth control
[14]. Gap junctions are defined as cell-cell junctions at
which two plasma membranes from adjacent cells link.
Gap junctions are specialized intercellular connections
formed by a family of at least 24 human proteins called
connexins that allow for the diffusion of small molecules
and ions directly between the cytoplasm of adjoining
cells [15]. Individual connexins show tissue-, cell-type-,
or developmental stage-specific expression, and most
organs as well as many cell types express more than

To assess whether direct cell-cell communication
was present in leukemia cells, we used several cell lines
to model both ALL and AML (Figure 1A-1D). After
Calcein AM- and DiI-labeled Jurkat cells were mixed
and incubated for 1 hr, flow cytometry analysis detected
4.1±0.4% Calcein transfer from Calcein-labeled cells to
DiI-labeled cells (Figure 1B). Increasing the length of
time that cells were allowed to mix permitted the Calcein
to spread to more cells, indicative that dye transfer is a
passive, on-going process. After 3 hr of co-incubation, dye
transfer increased to 90.6±3.6%, confirming that connexin
channels are functional in Jurkat cells (Figure 1B). The
increase in Calcein transfer over time was further validated
by the increase of fluorescence intensity over time (Figure
31509

1C). This suggests that as cells interact with each other for
increased lengths of time, Calcein transfers to a greater
number of cells, thus amplifying the intensity of the signal.
To better represent cell-cell communication in leukemia,
dye transfer was also measured in a primary patientderived AML cell line as well as in two characterized
human AML cell lines, MV4-11 and THP1. The direct
percentage of dye transfer was variable among all tested
cell lines but confirmed that direct cell-cell communication
is conserved among leukemia cells (Figure 1D).
Additionally, to test whether the detected dye
transfer was mediated by direct physical contact between
cells and was not a result of Calcein uptake from the cell
culture media itself, we performed dye transfer assays with
0.4 μm Transwell inserts, thereby keeping the two groups
of cells from making contact (Supplemental Figure 1A).
After 1 and 3 hr of incubation, the control wells without

inserts with physical cell-cell contact had a higher relative
percentage of dye transfer than those that were separated
by the Transwell inserts (Supplemental Figure 1B). In
addition, to demonstrate that Calcein does not leak out of
cells and into the surrounding media, flow cytometry was
utilized to measure Calcein signal at 1, 2, and 3 hr. Indeed,
leukemia cells did not lose intensity during the time course
used for our experiments, arguing that dye uptake requires
cell-cell contact. It should be noted that the percentage
of transfer was highly variable among the four cell lines
used (20-98% after 3 hr) and was dependent on several
factors including cell type and the stochastic nature of
cell-cell interactions in vitro, as we cannot control which
individual cells form gap junction channels. However,
taken together, these data demonstrate that functional and
quantifiable cell-cell communication exists in leukemia
and is dependent on physical cell-cell contact.

Effects of gap junction inhibition on dye transfer

this time point, indicating that slower compensatory
communication mechanisms likely exist in leukemia cells
when gap junctions are inhibited. These data demonstrate
that homotypic cell-cell communication relies on
functional gap junctions and may be blocked through
pharmacological inhibition of connexin subunits.

To evaluate whether the observed cell-cell
communication was gap junction dependent, two clinically
relevant pan-gap junction inhibitors, CBX and 1-octanol,
were used to inhibit gap junctions in leukemia cells.
CBX is currently approved for the clinical treatment of
esophageal and mouth ulcers in the United Kingdom
[22], while 1-octanol is currently being investigated for
the treatment of essential tremor [23]. Cells were stained
with Calcein AM and DiI as previously described, treated
with each inhibitor, and allowed to incubate for either 1
or 3 hr, after which the percent of Calcein dye transfer
to DiI-labeled cells was measured using flow cytometry.
After 1 hr of co-incubation, Jurkat cells showed a 6.1%
transfer, with MV4-11 cells showing an 18.5% transfer.
However, when co-incubated in the presence of 100 µM
CBX or 1 mM 1-octanol, both Jurkat and MV4-11 cells
exhibited reduced dye transfer percentages compared
with their vehicle controls (Figure 2). Furthermore, after
3 hr of co-incubation with CBX and 1-octanol, Jurkat
and THP1 cells continued to show a reduced percentage
of dye transfer (Supplemental Figure 2), while MV4-11
cells did not demonstrate a reduction in dye transfer at

qRT-PCR screen of connexins in AML and
JURKAT cells versus HSCs
To identify whether specific connexins are expressed
in leukemia, a qRT-PCR screen of known connexin
subunits was employed. Normal hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs) were probed to identify tumor-specific
connexins important in leukemia cells but not healthy
controls. Three connexins were found to be increased in
all leukemia cell lines tested: Cx25, Cx40, and Cx31.9
(Figure 3). Bioinformatics data using RNA-seq were
subsequently generated to narrow down those connexins
that were detected in the Cancer Genome Atlas AML
dataset [20]. Samples were organized by the French
American British (FAB) morphological categories, with
the group expressing high Cx25/GJB7 consisting of M3
AML. Consequently, Cx25 and Cx31.9 were found to

on cell membranes (Supplemental Figure 4C). To further
confirm the role of Cx25 in leukemia, we utilized a genetic
approach to disrupt Cx25 by RNA interference (RNAi).
We obtained two independent short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
constructs to knock down Cx25 expression (knockdown
13 (KD 13) and knockdown 36 (KD 36)) in Jurkat cells.
Compared with a nontargeting (NT) control, both Cx25
knockdown constructs reduced Cx25 expression as
evaluated by immunoblotting and qRT-PCR (Figure 4B).
Dye transfer assays were subsequently utilized to measure
whether cell-cell communication was disrupted after Cx25
knockdown. A decrease in dye transfer was observed in
Cx25 knockdown cells after 1 hr of incubation (11% dye
transfer in KD 13 cells and 76% dye transfer in KD 36
cells) versus the NT control (87% dye transfer) (Figure
4C). However, after 3 hr of incubation, the percent of
transfer was similar in all three groups, indicating the
presence of additional compensatory communication
mechanisms not dependent on Cx25.

Cx25 knockdown inhibits leukemia cell-cell
communication
By PCR-based analysis, Cx25 and Cx40 were
identified as potential tumor-promoting connexin subunits
expressed in both primary AML cells and Jurkat cells,
while Cx31.9 was expressed by primary AML cell
lines. To validate our observation at the protein level,
immunoblot analysis of Cx25 and Cx31.9 was utilized.
Cx25 protein expression was found in all leukemia
cell lines tested (Figure 4A, Supplemental Figure 4A),
although Cx31.9 protein expression was undetectable (data
not shown). In addition, Cx25 expression was visualized
in both Jurkat and THP1 cells using immunofluorescence
as both Jurkat and THP1 cells were found to express Cx25

normal HSCs, Jurkat cells, two primary patient-derived AML cell specimens, and two AML cell lines, MV4-11 and THP1. Two connexins
were found to be more highly expressed in all leukemia cells versus normal HSCs, Cx25 and Cx40, while primary AML cell lines expressed
higher levels of Cx31.9 compared with HSCs.

demonstrated a reduced capability to proliferate compared
with their NT counterparts when incubated with 15 nM
Ara-C (Figure 5A), suggesting that gap junction inhibition
in combination with chemotherapy may be a potentially
viable treatment strategy. These results indicate that Cx25
knockdown sensitizes leukemia cells to chemotherapeutics
in vitro and may justify gap junction inhibition as an
addition to current standard-of-care regimens. Although

Following Cx25 knockdown, the proliferative
capability of leukemia cells was interrogated but did
not show a reduction compared with NT controls
(Supplemental Figure 4B), indicating that the disruption

apoptosis. Interestingly, when Cx25 knockdown cells were

knockdown, the disruption of cell-cell communication
suggests a therapeutic potential for the targeting of gap
junction function in leukemia. To that end, we further
interrogated the phenotype of Cx25 knockdown in Jurkat
and MV4-11 cells. We hypothesized that inhibition of
Cx25 may sensitize leukemia cells to chemotherapeutics,
as they would respond less rapidly to cellular damage.
Indeed, when Cx25 was knocked down in Jurkat and MV411 cells, both constructs decreased proliferation in the
presence of 15 nM Ara-C (also known as arabinofuranosyl
cytidine), a common chemotherapeutic agent used for the
treatment of AML and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Figure
5A). To test whether this phenomenon was specific for
Cx25, we similarly knocked down Cx43 with two shRNA
constructs previously described in prostate cancer [19].
The decision to focus on Cx43 as a control rather than the
other connexin subunits identified in the qRT-PCR screen
was mediated by the fact that Cx43 is heavily studied in
a wide variety of normal and pathophysiological contexts

and would allow for a phenotypic comparison following
shRNA disruption of either subunit. After confirming
Cx43 knockdown with qRT-PCR (Supplemental Figure
5A), we treated Jurkat cells with 15 nM Ara-C and
found that Cx43 inhibition did not sensitize the cells to
chemotherapy (Supplemental Figure 5B). In addition,
we performed dye transfer assays with Cx43-knockdown
Jurkat cells and found that dye transfer was not affected
at any time point (Supplemental Figure 6), indicating that
Cx25 rather than Cx43 plays an important role in leukemia
cell communication and chemosensitivity. Finally, we
wanted to elucidate whether pharmacological inhibition
of connexins is a feasible strategy for the development
of future therapeutics. All four cell lines tested showed a
decreased rate of proliferation following treatment with
100 μM CBX (Figure 5B). However, 1-octanol was less
effective at decreasing proliferation, as treatment with
several concentrations did not affect Jurkat cell growth
(Supplemental Figure 7). These data demonstrate that

to chemosensitize both Jurkat and MV4-11 cells.

relevant, as one of the major challenges in the treatment
of leukemia is the tolerability of current anti-leukemia
agents. Children, the elderly, and those in general poor
health are particularly susceptible to the side-effects of
chemotherapy and are often unable to be treated. Future
studies should be aimed at determining if Cx25 is linked
to leukemia patient survival across multiple leukemia
subtypes. However, this may be challenging as many
databases do not contain Cx25 and these data may need to
be generated. To further translate our findings, leukemia
cell were treated with clinically relevant gap junction
inhibitors, CBX and 1-octanol, at pharmacologically
relevant concentrations [22, 23], and cell-cell transfer
of Calcein decreased. However, only CBX was found to
be effective at reducing leukemia cell proliferation. The
inhibition of gap junction communication in leukemia
cells followed by treatment with chemotherapeutics may
allow for a much lower chemotherapy dose to be used,
achieving the desired results while sparing patients from
the harmful effects inherent to cancer treatment. However
additional in vitro and in vivo studies are critical to
determine the exact mechanisms behind gap junctionmediated cellular communication in leukemia. A wider
screen of chemotherapeutics would also be necessary
to investigate which combinatorial adjuvants best
complement each other in pre-clinical models of leukemia.
Physical contact between cells was also found
to be necessary for functional gap junction activity, as
prohibiting this interaction did not allow for Calcein
transfer. The ability of leukemia cells to communicate
with each other and their surrounding microenvironment
through gap junctions has the potential to affect the
malignancy of leukemia. Cells are better able to respond
to external stimuli and escape damage from sources
such as chemotherapeutics and radiation by exchanging
information amongst themselves. In addition, gap
junctions may allow for the release of potentially lethal
intercellular components such as reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in response to cell damage or may facilitate the
uptake of molecules that protect from ROS-induced DNA
damage [27]. Recent work on gap junctions in HSCs has
confirmed that Cx43-deficient HSCs and HPCs displayed
decreased survival and increased senescence mediated
by their inability to transfer ROS to the hematopoietic
microenvironment following myeloablation [28]. These
results demonstrate that Cx43 plays a protective role
during stressful conditions such as hematopoietic recovery.
Targeting gap junction-mediated communication
in leukemia and other cancers is emerging as an exciting
prospective strategy with easily translatable results
[29,19]. Specifically, the additive survival advantage that
gap junction inhibition in combination with chemotherapy
confers in animal models of glioblastoma is particularly
promising [30]. However, several caveats remain to be
addressed regarding both CBX and 1-octanol before
clinical trials are implemented. Both agents demonstrate

Cx25 is highly expressed in leukemia cell lines
compared with other tumors
We have shown in vitro that inhibition of Cx25
can sensitize leukemia cells to chemotherapy; however,
there is limited information as to the role of Cx25 in
leukemia in vivo. We interrogated Cx25 expression
across multiple tumor cell lines and found significantly
higher expression in leukemia cell lines as compared
with other tumors (Figure 6). This was not observed with
other highly expressed connexins identified in Figure 3
(Cx40 and Cx31.9) and Cx43. Taken together, these data
demonstrate that Cx25 may have a unique role in leukemia
cell communication and may serve as an attractive target
for the development of future adjuvant therapeutics.

Discussion
The cellular microenvironment plays a major role in
tumorigenesis by providing nutrients and survival signals
to cancer cells [25]. Additionally, the microenvironment
may protect tumor cells from normal immune responses
and promote resistance to therapeutic treatment regimens.
Evidence in ALL has demonstrated that osteoblasts secrete
an ECM molecule, osteopontin (OPN), that plays an
important role in anchoring leukemia blasts in anatomic
microenvironmental locations that support tumor cell
dormancy and protect them from cytotoxic chemotherapy
[26]. In other cases, tumor cells are even able to co-opt
their microenvironment by crowding out normal cells,
subsequently fashioning their milieu to provide them
with a competitive survival advantage [4]. However, in
many instances, the direct mechanisms by which tumor
cells utilize their surroundings is poorly understood. While
tumor cells may secrete various stimulatory growth factors
and cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, TGF-β, and IL-10 to
avoid immunosurveillance and create a pro-tumorigenic
environment, little is yet understood about how direct cellcell communication between the tumor cells, rather than
tumor-stroma interactions, influences malignancy.
Here, we have shown that leukemia cells directly
communicate with each other through at least one
specific connexin, Cx25, which is increased in primary
patient AML cells compared with normal hematopoietic
cells. Likewise, Cx25 expression was also detected in
Jurkat cells, a model for ALL, as well as in MV4-11
and THP1 cells, both models for AML. Using RNAi
strategies to disrupt Cx25 in Jurkat and MV4-11 cells,
we found that the communicative ability of the cells was
reduced, which translated to increased chemosensitivity
following treatment with Ara-C. This finding is clinically

importance is the development of novel mimetic peptides
or agents capable of disrupting individual connexin
subunits to minimize the harm to normal tissue in the
course of treatment. Cancer therapy as a whole is moving
away from a “one-size-fits-all” paradigm and toward a
more individualized model. Targeting specific connexin
subunits, depending on tumor subtype, is therefore
complementary to the emerging trends regarding cancer
care and should be considered for further attention.
Following radiation therapy, gap junctions also
play an important role in the “bystander effect,” in which
cells that are not directly exposed to radiation but are
in the vicinity also respond to the exposure and display
increased levels of genetic change and lethality. Recent
work using genetic approaches to downregulate Cx43
demonstrated that gap junction-mediated communication
is crucial for the transmission of radiation, causing
tumor responses in the distal CNS in areas not exposed
to direct radiation therapy. Surprisingly, Cx43 was also
found to be upregulated in nontargeted tissue following
irradiation, which may allow for the transduction of
potentially oncogenic signals to remote tissue through
the bystander effect [35]. An attractive additional strategy
for radiotherapy would be the identification of tumorspecific gap junctions through which “death signals” may
be transferred into the extracellular microenvironment to
affect adjacent tumor cells that may have been protected
from radiation. Alternatively, tumor-specific antigens
may be released through gap junctions after radiotherapy
or chemotherapy, priming the innate immune response
to identify and eradicate unaffected tumor cells. This
underlines the need to study gap junctions in the context
of cancer and develop novel connexin inhibitors for
pharmacological use [36].
Additional work is needed to determine the
molecular mechanisms of gap junction signaling to gain
a better understanding of the downstream signaling
components behind connexin activation or inhibition. We
have taken the first steps toward characterizing connexin
function in leukemia, although many hurdles remain
before gap junction inhibition will become an important
clinical tool for cancer therapy. However, our results are
an important proof-of-principle example, demonstrating
the value in exploring and exploiting novel concepts in
the fight against cancer.

remarkable efficacy for inhibiting gap junctions and tumor
cell growth in vitro and in vivo. However, their mechanism
of action is poorly understood. In particular, it should be
noted that these compounds do not specifically block
individual connexin subunits or gap junctions. Rather,
they are pan-gap junction inhibitors, ostensibly blocking
the function of all connexins and making it difficult to
study the particular connexin subunits that are involved in
tumor biology. It is also important to remember that these
inhibitors are capable of blocking additional hemichannels,
such as pannexins, necessating careful examination of the
molecular signaling pathways behind the mechanisms of
CBX and 1-octanol function, as current reports remain
contradictory. Less is known about connexin hemichannel
activity, although both CBX and 1-octanol have been
shown to be capable of disrupting hemichannels in
keratinocytes [31] and spinal cord astrocytes [32],
inhibiting ATP and chemokine release, respectively.
Functional connexin and pannexin hemichannels have
also been described to play a role in leukocyte adhesion
[33], as demonstrated by decreased adhesion to venular
endothelium after treatment with CBX. However, a
contradictory study reported that reducing Cx40 levels
instead increased leukocyte adhesion to mouse endothelial
cells [34]. These contrasting conclusions are likely a result
of the tissue-specific function of connexins in vivo and
highlight the complexity of connexin function. It is also
important to note that blocking all gap junctions may have
unintended off-target effects that need to be addressed
before considering clinical trials. Additionally, the exact
method by which the agents inhibit connexin function is
an ongoing area of investigation. It has been hypothesized
that both CBX and 1-octanol act on cell membranes to
alter fluidity and disrupt the transmembrane domains of
connexin proteins, rendering them inert. However, this
explanation has yet to be fully investigated and remains
speculative.
The ablation of highly expressed connexins is not
sufficient to target and destroy leukemia cells, nor is it
sufficient to completely prevent cell-cell communication.
Targeting specific connexins may also have secondary
effects or cause a concomitant increase in the expression
of other connexin proteins, leading to unintended
phenotypic consequences. It is prudent to consider that
connexins may possess additional functions that have yet
to be fully described. To this end, cytoplasmic partners
capable of interacting with the intracellular domains
of connexin proteins may provide a potential means of
specifically targeting individual subunits. The ablation of
one universal connexin may have unintended secondary
effects or no effects at all, as compensatory mechanisms
likely exist among various connexin proteins. Rather, gap
junction inhibition strategies should be contextualized
in light of the overall tumor or, even more effectively, in
light of the cell-of-origin of the tumor, to target the root
of the malignancy rather than the branches. Of paramount

and 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 20% oxygen and 5% CO2. The
primary AML cells used in this study (AML1, AML2)
have previously been described [18] and were obtained
from patients with relapsed/refractory AML according
to approved Cleveland Clinic IRB protocols. These cells
had a myelomonocytic morphology (M4) and multiple
chromosomal abnormalities including t(8;18)(q22:q23)
and t(11;13)(q21:q12). Primary AML cells were cultured
in IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS and 10 ng/ml of
the following human cytokines: stem cell factor (SCF),
FLT3 ligand, thrombopoietin, interleukin-3 (IL-3), and
interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Life Technologies). The THP1 and
MV4-11 cell lines were cultured in RPMI supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Sigma), penicillin, streptomycin, and L-glutamine.

then mixed at a 1:1 ratio; incubated for 1, 2, or 3 hr;
and analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Fortessa to
quantify the percentage of transfer of green calcein to DiIlabeled cells. Single DiI- and Calcein-stained control cells
were used to verify the efficacy of the dyes and to set flow
cytometry gates. After functional gap junction activity
was confirmed, cells were incubated in the same manner
as above in the presence or absence of the gap junction
inhibitors carbenoxolone (CBX) and 1-octanol and
likewise analyzed using flow cytometry. Flow cytometry
experiments analyzed four different biological samples
(Jurkat cells, one primary patient-derived AML specimen,
and two different AML lines, MV4-11 and THP1). For
the dye transfer assay, 20, 000 events were collected from
a total of five groups of 1.0x106 cells of each biological
sample (one vehicle control and two carbenoxolone and
two 1-octanol concentrations).

Isolation of CD34+ HSCs

To confirm that dye transfer required direct cell-cell
contact, cells were divided into two equal groups. One
group was pre-loaded with Calcein AM while the other
was pre-loaded with DiI.
Cells were subsequently incubated for 1, 2, or 3 hr
in 6-well dishes with 12 mm Transwell Inserts containing
a 0.4 μM pore (Corning) used to keep the two groups
physically separated (Schematic provided in Supplemental
Figure 1A). While in culture, the Calcein group was
incubated in the apical chamber of the insert to ensure
that if dye was released into the media, the donor DiIlabeled cells in the basolateral chamber would be capable
of taking it up and subsequently fluorescing green. After
incubation, both cell populations were mixed, and dye
transfer was quantified using flow cytometry as described
above.

Transwell assay

CD34+ cells from bone marrow aspirates were
immunopositively purified using a magnetic cell
sorting system (Miltenyi Biotec) per the manufacturer’s
instructions and used as a negative control. Briefly,
bone marrow aspirates were gathered and frozen in
10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and FBS. Cells were
stored in liquid nitrogen until needed. After thawing,
cells were purified using a magnetic cell sorting system
(CD34 MicroBead Kit #130-046-702, Miltenyl Biotec
Inc., Auburn, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. CD34+ cells were considered normal HSCs
and were cultured in IMDM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/ml of the following human
cytokines: stem cell factor, FLT3 ligand, thrombopoietin,
IL-3, and IL-6.

Proliferation assay

Dye transfer assay

To quantify leukemia cell proliferation, a CellTiterGloTM proliferation assay (Promega) was utilized. Briefly,
cells were plated in clear-bottom 96-well plates at a
density of 1000 cells per well in 100 µL of culture media.
In addition, to test whether Cx25 knockdown was capable
of sensitizing leukemia cells to chemotherapy, cells were
incubated in the presence or absence of arabinofuranosyl
cytidine (Ara-C), also known as cytarabine, and
proliferation was measured at Day 0 and Day 3. Cells
were allowed to recover for at least 2 hr before the first
measurement was taken, which served as a loading
control. The luminescence intensity of each well was
measured using a luminometer (PerkinElmer) at several
time points after plating. Each sample was run in triplicate
to evaluate variablility. To prepare relative growth curves,
the data were normalized to day 0 to account for any

For dye transfer assessments, cells were divided into
two groups. One group was labeled with 1 mM Calcein
AM (Life Technologies), a cell-permeable dye in its parent
form that is converted to the green-fluorescent Calcein
after acetoxymethyl ester hydrolysis by intracellular
esterases, after which it is no longer cell permeable and
only able to leave the cell via gap junctions, hemichannels,
or exocytosis. The other group of cells was labeled with 3
μM DiI (Life Technologies), a lipophilic membrane stain
that diffuses laterally to stain the entire cell and does not
leave the cell membrane. In both cases, cells were labeled
for 45 minutes with either Calcein AM or DiI according
to the manufacturer’s instructions before centrifugation
to remove excess dye. These two groups of cells were

variation during preparation.

Quantitative real-time PCR

Cx25 inhibition was accomplished by shRNA in
Jurkat cells. In short, plasmid DNA was isolated from
glycerol stocks of bacteria containing shRNA plasmid
DNA (Sigma MISSION shRNA) specific to Cx25
(TRCN0000222613 (KD13) and TRCN0000074136 (KD
36)) or a nontargeting control (NT) and used to produce
virus. These shRNA plasmids were chosen from a group of
five total plasmids as they were shown to reliably reduce
the levels of Cx25, as demonstrated by immunoblotting
and qRT-PCR. Additional shRNA constructs against
Cx43 were also purified from bacterial glycerol stocks
(TRCN0000059775 (KD 75) and TRCN0000059776 (KD
76) and were likewise used to inhibit Cx43 expression
in Jurkat cells as demonstrated by qRT-PCR. Bacterial
stocks were expanded, and plasmid DNA was purified
using PureLink HiPure Plasmid Maxiprep Kit (Life
Technologies) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
293T cells were cotransfected with the packaging vectors
pMD2.G and psPAX2 (Addgene) and shRNA constructs.
Media on the 293T cell cultures were changed 18 hr
after transfection, and viral supernatants were collected
24, 36, and 48 hr later and filtered for immediate use or
concentrated with polyethylene glycol precipitation and
stored at -80oC for future use. Jurkat cells and MV4-11
cells were subsequently infected with lentiviral particles
using the Sigma MISSION shRNA Spinoculation protocol,
and transduced cells were selected after incubation with
puromycin.

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA synthesis and amplification from 1 μg
mRNA via PCR was performed using the qScriptTM cDNA
Supermix (Quanta Biosciences) with an Eppendorf Vapo
Protect Mastercycler Pro (Eppendorf). This kit contains
both oligo(dT) and random primers. Gene expression
was measured by real-time PCR using the RT2 SYBR
Green ROXTM qPCR Mastermix Kit (SABiosciences).
Connexin primers were utilized for 20 different
connexins as previously described [19] and validated by
verification of single-peak melt curves. The PCR product
for Cx25 was further validated by the verification of
a single band on an agarose gel. The PCR reaction and
detection were performed with the ABI 7000 Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems). To minimize
variability due to single housekeeping gene adjustment,
individual connexin expression levels were normalized
to multiple housekeeping genes (β-actin and GAPDH).
After adjustment to housekeeping genes, the difference
in cycle numbers for each individual connexin was
further normalized to that of HSCs. The fold change was
subsequently calculated by squaring the cycle difference
between each tumor cell type and HSCs, and each
technical replicate was performed in triplicate. The cycle
number for each connexin subunit after adjustment to
housekeeping genes is provided in Supplemental Table 1.

Cx25 immunofluorescence

Detection of Cx25 by immunoblotting

To visualize Cx25 expression and localization in
leukemia cells, Jurkat and THP1 cells were centrifuged
onto glass slides using a Cytospin protocol. Cells were
fixed with 4% PFA for 10 minutes and washed three times
with 0.1% PBST (PBS/Triton X-100) for 5 minutes. After
washing, cells were blocked with 10% normal goat serum
for 30 minutes. Rabbit polyclonal anti-Cx25 (Sigma,
SAB4501629, 1:100) was used to stain cells overnight
at 4°C. The following day, cells were washed 3 times
with 0.1% PBST, and the appropriate secondary antibody
was applied for 2 hr at room temperature (goat antirabbit IgG Alexa Flour 488, Life Technologies, 1:2000).
After secondary antibody incubation, cells were washed
three times with 0.1% PBST and counterstained with
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 minutes.
Afterwards, cells were washed three additional times with
0.1% PBST, and coverslips were mounted using FluorSave
Reagent (VWR International). Cells were imaged with a
Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope, and images were
prepared in figure form using Adobe Photoshop.

Immunoblot analysis was performed on the wholecell extracts of primary AML specimens, Jurkat cells, and
primary GBM cells used as a control. Cells were lysed in
10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4; 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (weight/
volume); 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 2 mM sodium
orthovanadate; 1 mM PMSF; and a 1:100 dilution of
protease inhibitor cocktail for mammalian cells (P8340
Sigma), followed by protein determination using a Pierce
BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Protein
(20 μg) from cells was separated by SDS-PAGE using
a 12% gel and then transferred to a PVDF membrane.
After blocking the membrane with 5% milk in TBST,
total Cx25 was detected using rabbit polyclonal antiCx25 (Sigma, SAB4501629), then incubated with the
secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase. The
immunoreactive bands were visualized by Pierce ECL
2 Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific). Blots
were washed and reprobed with an anti-actin antibody
(Santa Cruz) and developed in an identical manner to
assess β-actin protein levels to ensure even loading.
