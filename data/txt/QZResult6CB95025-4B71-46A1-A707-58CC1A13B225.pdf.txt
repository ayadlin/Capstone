ABSTRACT:
Tumor blood vessels are leaky and immature, which causes inadequate blood
supply to tumor tissues resulting in hypoxic microenvironment and promotes
metastasis. Here we have explored tumor vessel modulating activity of Sac-1004,
a recently developed molecule in our lab, which directly potentiates VE-cadherinmediated endothelial cell junction. Sac-1004 could enhance vascular junction
integrity in tumor vessels and thereby inhibit vascular leakage and enhance vascular
perfusion. Improved perfusion enabled Sac-1004 to have synergistic anti-tumor
effect on cisplatin-mediated apoptosis of tumor cells. Interestingly, characteristics
of normalized blood vessels namely reduced hypoxia, improved pericyte coverage
and decreased basement membrane thickness were readily observed in tumors
treated with Sac-1004. Remarkably, Sac-1004 was also able to inhibit lung and lymph
node metastasis in MMTV and B16BL6 tumor models. This was in correlation with a
reduction in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of tumor cells with considerable
diminution in expression of related transcription factors. Moreover, cancer stem cell
population dropped substantially in Sac-1004 treated tumor tissues. Taken together,
our results showed that direct restoration of vascular junction could be a significant
strategy to induce normalization of tumor blood vessels and reduce metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

morphology [3]. Leaky blood vessels result in hemorrhage
that increases interstitial fluid pressure and limits
vascular perfusion, leading to a hypoxic and acidotic
microenvironment [1, 3, 4]. In this microenvironment,
cancer, endothelial, and stromal cells secrete various
growth factors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor
[VEGF], angiopoietin [Ang]2, platelet derived growth

Tumor angiogenesis features leaky, dilated,
saccular, and tortuous blood vessels; the extent and
type of abnormality varies with tumor type and location
[1-3]. Tumors commonly exhibit an abnormally thick
basement membrane and perivascular cells with abnormal

factor (PDGF), placental growth factor, transforming
growth factor (TGF)-alpha, and hepatocyte growth
factor), establishing an endless loop of non-productive
angiogenesis [2, 3]. In addition, hypoxia and hypoxia
inducible factor (HIF)-1 triggers a series of events known
as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which
not only promotes primary growth but also metastasis of
tumor [5, 6].
Previous studies showed that tumor therapies
targeting angiogenic growth factors are much effective
when given in combination with cytotoxic (chemo and
radio) agents [1]. It was suggested that anti-angiogenic
therapy, to some extent, corrects the flaw in structure
and function of tumor blood vessels. This normalization
of vessels decreases leakiness and improves perfusion
resulting in enhanced delivery and efficacy of cytotoxic
agents [7-9]. Though highly effective, the efficiency of
combination therapy is restrained by the limited duration
of normalization window [8]. Other studies reported
that increased expression of Ang1 was able to stabilize
blood vessels [10-12]. Similarly, inhibition of Ang2 was
shown to improve endothelial cell-cell junction, induce
tumor vessel normalization [13], and inhibit metastasis
[14]. Various other investigators have extensively
studied the tumor vascular normalization phenomenon
[4, 15], and the importance of vascular junction in tumor
microenvironment modulation is irrefutable. Nevertheless,
the effects of direct potentiation of endothelial junction on
tumor vascular normalization and metastasis has not been
clearly demonstrated.
Recently we developed a vascular-leakage-blocking
molecule Sac-1004, which promisingly reduced VEGFinduced endothelial permeability in cell-based assays [16,
17]. Sac-1004 was found to reorganize actin cytoskeleton
at endothelial cell-cell junction to form cortical actin ring
via cAMP/Rac/Cortactin pathway. This cortical actin
ring enhanced cell-cell junction integrity by upregulation
of junction proteins such as vascular endothelial (VE)cadherin. Interestingly, in addition to VEGF, Sac-1004
could dampen other agonists (thrombin and histamine)induced vascular hyperpermeability too via similar
mechanism [18].
Here, we found that Sac-1004 could substantially
inhibit vascular leakage in pathological conditions like
diabetic retina and tumor. This provided an effective way
to study the correlation between vascular permeability
and tumor behavior. Remarkably, significant vascular
normalization was observed in Sac-1004 treated tumors.
Additionally, reduced hypoxia together with increased
vascular stability seemingly reduced the extent of
metastasis in treated tumor models. This coincided with
down-regulation of various EMT-regulating transcription
factors, along with a drop in cancer stem cell (CSC)
population, in Sac-1004 treated tumors. Altogether, our
study demonstrates that direct inhibition of vascular
leakage by molecules like Sac-1004 could provide a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

novel strategy to induce vessel normalization and inhibit
metastasis.

RESULTS
Sac-1004 is capable of decreasing tumor vascular
leakage
Since vascular hyperpermeability is a long
recognized hallmark of tumors [19], we evaluated the
effect of Sac-1004 on vascular leakage in vivo. VEGF is
one of the prominent molecules responsible for leakiness
of tumor vessels [20-22]; thus we initially investigated
the effect of Sac-1004 in retinas of VEGF-treated and
diabetic mice [23, 24]. Sac-1004 significantly attenuated
VEGF-induced retinal vascular leakage (Supplementary
Figure S2A,B). Likewise, retinal hyperpermeability
in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice was inhibited
by intravitreous/intravenous injections of Sac-1004
(Supplementary Figure S2C-G). Since Sac-1004 was
shown to stabilize junction protein VE-cadherin in vitro
[18], we analyzed junction protein levels in diabetic mice
retina. Sac-1004 treatment restored the expressions of VEcadherin and occludin in diabetic retinas (Supplementary
Figure S2H,I).
Next we treated B16F10 and LLC tumors, grown
subcutaneously in mice, with Sac-1004 and examined
leakage using Evans blue dye and FITC-dextran (Figure
1A). We found that Sac-1004 treatment significantly
reduced tumor vessel leakiness (Figure 1B-D and
Supplementary Figure S4B,C); however, tumor growth
was not affected in either tumor (Supplementary Figure
S3B,S4A). Interestingly, significantly increased number
of VE-cadherin-positive vessels were observed in B16F10
tumors receiving Sac-1004 (Figure 1E,F). Additionally,
VE-cadherin lining was discontinuous in the control group
but continuous in the treatment groups (Figure 1E). Sac1004-treated LLC tumors also exhibited similar continuous
lining of VE-cadherin and ZO-1 (Supplementary Figure
S4D and Figure 1G). Increase in VE-cadherin level was
confirmed by Western blot of tumor proteins (Figure 1I,J).
Angiopoietins are well known regulators of vascular
stability [25] and Ang2 serves as a promoter of vascular
junction destabilization [14, 26]. Immunostaining of
B16F10 tumor sections showed substantially reduced
Ang2 expression in Sac-1004 group (Supplementary
Figure S3H,I). Also reduction in Ang2 expression in Sac1004-treated HUVECs was observed in time-dependent
manner (Supplementary Figure S4H,I).
Sac-1004, by itself, did not exert any cytotoxic
effects on various tumor cells in vitro (Supplementary
Figure S3A), nor did it have significant effect on EC
proliferation, apoptosis, and necrosis (Supplementary
Figure S3C-E). These results suggest that Sac-1004 can

growth and deterioration of tumor endothelial cells.

We found that Sac-1004 treatment increased the ratio
of perfused blood vessels as shown by Hoechst staining
(Figure 2C,F and Supplementary Figure S5A) and by
tomato lectin (Figure 2A,B and Supplementary Figure
S4F,G).
Also, Sac-1004 treatment significantly reduced
hypoxia in both tumors (Figure 2C,E and Supplementary

Sac-1004 (Figure 2G and Supplementary Figure S3G).
Interestingly, we observed that vascular density in periand intratumoral regions of B16F10 tumor was decreased
by Sac-1004 treatment (Figure 2C,D); however, such a
change was not evident in LLC tumors (Supplementary
Figure S5A). The intrinsic characteristics and response to
therapeutic agents may differ among tumor types. Overall,
these findings indicate that Sac-1004-induced vascularpermeability-reduction increases patency and results in
diminution of hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

cisplatin alone; however, the growth inhibition was
significantly augmented in combination group (Figure
3A). Consequently, survival of tumor-bearing mice was
substantially increased in the combination group (Figure
3B). Similar patterns were found in LLC tumors treated
with Sac-1004 and cisplatin (Figure 3E,F). Consistently,
TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were markedly increased
in B16F10 and LLC tumors of combination treatment
group (Figure 3C,D,G,H). These results suggest that Sac1004 could enhance the access of cytotoxic drugs to tumor
cells and thereby improve therapeutic response.

Tumor Blood Vessels

Sac-1004 Mediates Reduction of Lung Metastasis
in MMTV-PyMT Mice

We further evaluated B16F10 and LLC tumor
sections for basement membrane thickness and pericyte
coverage; signatures of normalized tumor vessels [4].
Both the tumor vessels exhibited abnormally thickened
basement membranes when stained for Collagen IV.
Upon treatment with Sac-1004, this abnormal thickness
was significantly alleviated (Figure 2H (up),I and
Supplementary Figure S5D,E). Immunostaining of
B16F10 tumor sections for laminin also revealed detached
basement membrane structures, which was prevented by
Sac-1004 treatment (Figure 2H (down)); however, LLC
tumor sections didnât exhibit any significant difference
(Supplementary Figure S5C).
Staining of LLC tumor sections for pericyte marker
NG2 and desmin revealed pericyte coverage deficiency, as
previously noted [27]. However, Sac-1004-treated tumors
exhibited marked increase in extent and fraction of NG2
and desmin-positive pericyte covered vessels (Figure 2J
and Supplementary Figure S5F,G). Unlike LLC tumors,
B16F10 tumor blood vessels are covered with pericytes
as noted previously [28] and Sac-1004 treatment did not
induce any further change (Supplementary Figure S5H).
Extravasation of plasma components via leaky
vessels creates an inflammatory environment, recruiting
macrophages. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)
release several growth factors which further escalate tumor
growth [2] and is also associated with poor prognosis in
cancer therapy [29, 30]. Examination of B16F10 tumor
showed that Sac-1004 treatment significantly reduced
F4/80+ TAM population (Supplementary Figure S5I,J).
Altogether, above results indicate that Sac-1004-mediated
leakage reduction could alter abnormal tumor vessels to
normalized forms.

Vascular-Leakage-Inhibition
Chemosensitivity of Tumor

We also investigated the effect of vascular-leakage
inhibition on spontaneously growing breast tumor as in
MMTV-PyMT mice (Figure 4A). MMTV mice receiving
Sac-1004 displayed reduction in tumor-vascular-leakage
in coherence with B16F10 and LLC tumors (Figure
4C,D). Though no significant change was observed in
tumor weight of control and drug-treated mice tumors
(Figure 4B), Sac-1004 treatment did increase vascular
perfusion (Figure 4E,F) and reduced HIF-1Î± expression
(Figure 4G,H). Interestingly, Sac-1004 caused reduction
in invasive tumor fraction in breast tumors (Figure 4I,J).
This was confirmed by an increase in the expression of
perilipin-1, a marker for fat cells (Figure 4K,L).
In concordance with B16F10 and LLC tumors,
MMTV tumors also exhibited increased VE-cadherin
and reduced Ang2 expression in blood vessels upon Sac1004 treatment (Supplementary Figure S6A-D). Intensive
pericyte coverage, thinned basement membrane, and
reduced macrophage population were evident in Sac-1004treated MMTV tumor sections (Supplementary Figure
S6E-I). Noticeably, Sac-1004 treated MMTV mice showed
significant reduction in number, size, and distribution of
lung-metastatic colonies (Figure 5B-E). Numerous, bigsized metastatic nodules were observed in control lungs;
however, fewer and small nodules were present in treated
ones (Figure 5B). Mice receiving long-term treatment
(8-14 weeks) also displayed similar reduction in lung
metastasis (Figure 5F-I). Surprisingly, the weight of breast
tumors was also reduced in mice receiving long-term or
late (12-14 week) treatment of Sac-1004 (Figure 5J);
however, no change in tumor cell apoptosis was observed.
Thus, Sac-1004 was able not only to normalize the blood
vessels in spontaneously growing tumor, but also to
prevent metastasis to a great extent.

Sac-1004 Reduces EMT in Tumor Cells

cells into the right footpad of mice, from where they
metastasize to lymph nodes and lungs [31]. In consistence
with MMTV tumor metastasis, B16BL6 tumor-bearing
mice receiving Sac-1004 (Figure 6A), exhibited reduced
number and size of lung metastatic colonies (Figure 6BD). In addition, there was a sharp drop in cytokeratin-18
positive cells migrating to popliteal lymph nodes (Figure
6F,G). Real-time-PCR analysis of inguinal lymph nodes
for tyrosinase-related-protein-1 (melanocyte marker)
also confirmed decreased lymph node metastasis in Sac1004 treated mice (Figure 6E); however, lymphatic vessel
number or structure seemed unaffected (Supplementary
Figure S6J). Hence, Sac-1004 was able to reduce distant
and regional metastasis in B16BL6 mice model.

Tumor cells fostered under hypoxic and acidotic
tumor environment undergo EMT and contribute to
metastasis [5, 6]. So we sought to analyze the expression
of E-cadherin (epithelial marker) and vimentin
(mesenchyme marker) in MMTV tumors. MMTV tumor
sections exhibited patchy staining pattern of E-cadherin in
control, while Sac-1004 group showed uniform E-cadherin
staining (Figure 7A). Also numerous vimentin positive
cells were seen in control tumor sections, the number of
which decreased sharply in Sac-1004 group (Figure 7B).
These findings were also confirmed by Western blotting of

its target transcription factors Snai1, Snai2, and Zeb2 were
significantly reduced in Sac-1004 treated MMTV tumors
(Figure 7D). Transcription of other genes involved in
EMT and metastasis namely Klf8, Aldh1, FoxC1, Mmp14,
Ccr5, and Cxcl12 was also found to be decreased by Sac-

tumor proteins (Figure 7C).
Hypoxia and HIF-1Î± have been shown to play key
role in promoting tumor growth and fueling EMT via
various pathways (Notch, hedgehog, Wnt, and TGF-Î²) [5,
6, 32]. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that Tgf-Î²1 and

1004 treatment (Figure 7E). These results suggest that
Sac-1004-mediated leakage inhibition is correlated with
reduction in metastasis and this involves downregulation
of EMT in tumor cells.
EMT is also responsible for cancer cells acquiring
stem cells like properties. These CSCs are critical for
promoting tumor growth and contributing to metastasis
[5, 32]. Since we observed reduced tumor mass (Figure
5J) and metastasis inhibition upon Sac-1004 treatment,
we sought to analyze CSC population in MMTV tumor
sections. Immunostaining of MMTV tumor samples for
CD133 revealed that nearly 20% of the cell population
possessed stem cell character in control tumors; however,
the number was reduced to approximately 10% upon
Sac-1004 treatment (Figure 7F,G). FACS analysis of
tumor cells from MMTV mice (long-term treatment) for
CD44+Sca1+ cell population also confirmed that CSC
population was substantially decreased after Sac-1004
treatment (Figure 7H,I). Conclusively, Sac-1004-induced
junction potentiation proved to be an efficient way to curb
EMT, which might have contributed to the decrease in
metastasis and induced-CSCs population of tumor.

affect the endothelial lining and vessel maturation via HIFdriven upregulation of soluble VEGFR-1 and VE-cadherin
[37]. It has also been reported that loss of regulator
of G-protein signaling 5 (Rgs5) could induce pericyte
maturation, vascular normalization, and marked reduction
in hypoxia and vessel leakiness [38]. Nonetheless, the
relation between vascular integrity and normalization still
remains elusive. Interestingly, studies with angiopoietins
show that Ang1 could enhance endothelial cell junction
integrity at the growing front [8, 10, 13] and inhibition
of Ang2 could normalize tumor blood vessels. These
reports suggest that junction tightening might be involved
in tumor vascular normalization. In the present study,
we directly stabilized the tumor endothelial junction by
reorganization of actin cytoskeleton with Sac-1004, and
this effectively resulted in increased perfusion, reduced
hypoxia and vascular normalization. We speculate that
hypoxia reduction by Sac-1004 might have affected certain
growth factors responsible for the interaction of ECs and
pericytes; and this would have caused enhanced pericyte
coverage. Hypoxia might also affect the activity of
matrix metalloproteases [2] which are responsible for the
thickness of basement membrane. Further investigation is
required to clarify these issues. Taken together, our study
has clearly shown that vascular junction integrity could be
a crucial factor for the induction of normalization in tumor
blood vessels.
Anomaly in vascular perfusion results in hypoxic
tumor microenvironment [2]. Cancer epithelial cells,
normally bound to underlying basement membrane,
undergo various change in their gene expression resulting
in altered adhesive, polarity and migratory properties
upon exposure to hypoxia. In the present study, Sac-1004
decreased both distant and regional metastasis in two
different mice models: i) MMTV-PyMT and ii) B16BL6
injected mice. This observation is correlated with a
previous study that showed inhibition of VE-cadherindependent junction disassembly can prevent distant
metastasis of cancer cells [39]. Metastasis inhibition
by Sac-1004 also coincided with the result that several
transcription factors (Snail, Twist, and Zeb) associated
with EMT were transcriptionally downregulated in
Sac-1004-treated tumors. Another component affecting
tumor metastasis is cancer stem cell population, which
is also responsible for tumor malignancy [40, 41]. We
found that Sac-1004 was able to delay the progression of
spontaneous breast tumor from hyperplasia to carcinoma
stage (Figure 4I). Consistently, a drop in CSC (CD133+;
CD44+Sca1+) population was observed in MMTV tumors
treated with Sac-1004. We also observed that long-term/
late treatment of MMTV mice with Sac-1004 was able to
reduce the tumor mass, even though the survival of tumor
cells was not found to be affected. We speculate that Sac1004-mediated decrease in CSC population at transition
stage of MMTV tumor (hyperplasia to carcinoma; Figure
7F and H) might contribute to such reducttion [41-43],

DISCUSSION
Tumor blood vessels are abnormal in structural and
functional aspect. Chaotic and non-uniform blood flow
give rise to a hostile hypoxic environment where tumor
cells bathe in variety of growth promoting factors. Poor
perfusion and leaky blood vessels limit the delivery of
cytotoxic agents to tumor and thereby decreases chemo/
radio therapeutic efficacy. This results in incomplete
therapy and subsequent recurrence of tumor. Further yet,
tumor cells that are educated in hypoxic environment
are often more viable and resistant to chemo/radio
therapy. These cells usually are more aggressive and
have a tendency to form metastases [3, 33]. Here, we
have demonstrated that direct potentiation of endothelial
junction integrity by a small molecule, Sac-1004, is a
reliable means to normalize blood vessels, soothe tumor
microenvironment, increase the efficacy of cytotoxic
agent, and reduce metastasis of tumor cells.
In the recent years, a number of studies have
reported the involvement of various factors in tumor
vascular normalization [1]. VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling
is involved in rapid proliferation of cells and induction
of hyperpermeability in blood vessels. Downregulation
of this signaling increases tumor oxygenation, increases
pericyte coverage, and improves pathologically thickened
basement membranes, at least during a time window [8,
34]; Semaphorin3A improves pericyte coverage of blood
vessels and restores normoxia [35]; Vasohibin-1 blocks
sprouting angiogenesis resulting in mature vessels covered
by mural cells [36]. In these cases, normalization seems to
be induced by curbing rapid growth of tumor blood vessels.
Alternatively, PHD2 haplodeficiency has been shown to

though further investigation awaits. Altogether, our study
suggests that vascular junction potentiation could increase
vascular perfusion and reduce hypoxia; which seems to be
an efficient way to reduce tumor malignancy by curbing
EMT and induced-CSC formation.
The structural feature of tumor blood vessels and
tumor microenvironment changes readily with type
and stage of tumor. Also various factors, in addition to
VEGF, are involved in tumor blood vessel abnormality;
the expression of which alters during therapeutic
period. This presses an extra degree of difficulty on
therapies that target a single factor to control tumor
growth. We found that Sac-1004 treatment was able to
induce vascular normalization in different tumors types:
B16F10 (VEGF sensitive melanoma), LLC (VEGF
insensitive lung carcinoma), and MMTV (spontaneous
tumor). Also, even when administered at different stage
of tumor growth in MMTV mice (8, 10, and 12 week),
Sac-1004 was able to reduce vascular hyperpermeability
and normalize blood vessels. These phenomena could be
correlated with the characteristics of Sac-1004 to affect
the common mechanism involved in junction stability,
which is converting actin stress fibers to cortical actin ring
structure. Thus, unlikely to anti-angiogenic therapies, Sac1004 could significantly extend the normalization window
duration, during which the co-treatment of cytotoxic
therapy is known to have additive/ synergistic effect.
These results suggest that it might be possible to use Sac1004, in combination with other therapies, to target various
tumor types. Systemic toxicity is another important factor
to be considered while developing a new drug. Antiangiogenic therapies, though highly effective, might
also affect normal blood vessels. They are reported to be
associated with, in some cases, increased risk of arterial
thromboembolic events, hypertension, renal side effects,
and impaired wound healing [44, 45]. Considering the
endothelial cell protecting and junction stabilizing activity
of Sac-1004 [18], it might have relatively less side-effects
on normal blood vessels. Indeed, we have not observed
any adverse effect on host vasculature, organ functioning,
and immune response (CD4, CD8 cell population) in
mice receiving Sac-1004 treatment so far (Supplementary
Figure S1D-F and Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore,
considering the vascular leakage inhibiting activity of Sac1004 in pathological conditions and its activity against
different agonists (VEGF, thrombin, histamine etc.), Sac1004 could probably be applied for other vascular leakage
related diseases such as ischemia/ reperfusion injury,
stroke, acute lung injury, acute and chronic inflammation,
diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration etc.
In conclusion, our study establishes that direct
inhibition of vascular leakage can be significant to soothe
tumor vasculature and limit metastatic spread of tumor
cells. This strategy, besides anti-angiogenic therapy, could
provide another way to effectively manipulate tumor
vessels and microenvironment for therapeutic as well as

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards and according to the Declaration of
Helsinki and according to national and international
guidelines and has been approved by the authorsâ
institutional review board.

Drugs
Sac-1004 was synthesized as described previously
[18]. Working solution of Sac-1004 was prepared
by diluting stock (in dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO) in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cisplatin was kindly
donated by Prof. Cho Byong Cheol (Severance Cancer
Hospital, Korea).

Pharmacokinetic analysis
Sac-1004 (50 mg/kg) was intravenously injected to
eight-week-old male C57BL6 mice. Blood samples were
taken from the tail vein at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 4,
6, and 8 h. An aliquot of each sample (30 Âµl) was mixed
with verapamil (internal standard) solution (5 Âµl, 500 ng/
ml) and after vortexing briefly, 150 ÂµL of cold methanol
was added to each sample. The samples were vortexed
again for 1 min and centrifuged for 4 min at 13000 rpm.
Supernatant obtained was injected into the HPLC system
(80 Âµl) equipped with an Agilent 6460 triple quadruple
MS/MS system and the peak area was recorded.

Mice
C57BL6 male mice (5/7 weeks old) were purchased
from Daehan Biolink (Seoul, Korea) and MMTV-PyMT
mice were generously obtained from Prof. Han Woong
Lee (Yonsei University, Korea). All the mice were
maintained in a laminar airflow cabinet under specific
pathogen-free conditions. The facilities were approved
by the Association of Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care, and animal experiments were
conducted under the institutional guidelines established
for the Animal Core Facility at Yonsei University College
of Medicine with approval of the institutional care and use
committee.

Diabetic retinopathy model

(Sigma, 75 mg/kg), injected intravenously 2 min before the
mice were sacrificed; and with biotinylated Lycopersicon
esculentum (tomato) lectin [46], (0.1 mg/mouse; Vector
Laboratories) injected 10 min before excision of tumor.

The mouse model of diabetic retinopathy was
generated as previously described [23]. Briefly, 8-weekold C57BL/6 male mice were injected intraperitoneally for
4 consecutive days with 90 mg/kg streptozotocin (Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) prepared in 0.1M sodium citrate
buffer (pH 4.5). Mice were considered diabetic when
the blood glucose concentration exceeded 300 mg/dl as
measured with a blood glucose test meter (Gluco Dr, All
Medicus Co. Ltd., Korea).
To evaluate the effect of Sac-1004 on vessel
leakage in diabetic retinopathy, the mice received a 2
Âµl intravitreal injection of Sac-1004 (1, 5, or 10 Âµg) in
one eye and the vehicle control in the contralateral eye.
After 24 h, vascular leakage was quantified by fluorescein
angiography. Briefly, 3 mg of 40-kDa FITC-dextran was
injected into the left ventricle in a volume of 100 Âµl and
allowed to circulate for 5 min. The eyes were enucleated
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and the
retinas were dissected out and cut in a Maltese cross
configuration. Leakage was viewed under a fluorescence
microscope (Carl Zeiss, USA) and quantified.

Histology and immunostaining
To evaluate tumor histology, tumors were excised
after perfusing the mice with 1% paraformaldehyde
and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde briefly. After an
overnight incubation in 15% and 30% sucrose each, the
specimens were embedded in optimal cutting temperature
compound and sectioned at 30 Î¼m thickness. Staining
was performed as previously described [8] by incubating
with one of the following antibodies: goat anti-VEcadherin (1:100; Santa Cruz), rat anti-CD31 (1:100; BD
Pharmingen, Korea), rabbit anti-perilipin (1:100; Abcam),
goat anti-ZO-1 (1:100; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-ColIV
(1:100; Chemicon International, Korea), rabbit anti-NG2
(1:500; Millipore, Korea), rabbit anti-desmin (1:100;
Abcam), rat anti-F4/80 (1:100; Abcam, Korea), goat antiAng1 (1:100; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Ang2 (1:100; Santa
Cruz), rabbit anti-laminin (1:1000; Thermo Scientific),
mouse anti-hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1Î± (1:100;
Thermo Scientific), rabbit anti-E-cadherin (1:100; Abcam),
rabbit anti-vimentin (1:100; Abcam), rat anti-CD133
(1:500; Millipore), rat anti-LYVE-1 (1:200; eBioscience),
mouse anti-cytokeratin-18 (1:100; Abcam), or mouse antiKi67 (1:100; BD Pharmingen). The sections were then
incubated in Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Nuclear staining was performed with 4â, 6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI, 1ng/ml), and apoptotic ECs were
detected using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) kit (Roche, Korea).
Sections were then photographed with a confocal
microscope (Zeiss LSM 510). Tumor necrosis was
determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining.
Hypoxia was detected by pimonidazole adduct
formation caused by an intravenous injection of 75 mg/
kg pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe-1, Chemicon) 1 h before
capture of tumor. Adducts were stained with a monoclonal
antibody directed against pimonidazole (Hypoxyprobe-1
kit, Chemicon).

Tumor model and treatment regime
B16F10 and LLC cells (5Ã105 cells/100 Âµl) were
subcutaneously implanted on the lateral flank of 8-weekold C57BL6 mice. B16BL6 cells (3Ã105 cells/50 Âµl) were
subcutaneously injected in the right footpad of 5-week-old
C57BL6 mice. These tumor models and MMTV female
mice were injected intravenously with Sac-1004 (50 mg/
kg) or an equivalent volume of DMSO (in PBS; 100 Âµl)
as indicated. Mice receiving combination therapy were
injected intraperitoneally with cisplatin (2.5 mg/kg) every
third day for 2 weeks. Tumor volume was measured with
calipers and calculated as width2ÃlengthÃ0.523.

Tumor permeability and vascular perfusion
Tumor permeability was assessed by the Evans
blue and the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran
as previously described [19]. Evans blue (50 mg/kg)
was injected intravenously and tumors were excised 30
min later. They were dried at 60 ÂºC for 16 h and then dye
was extracted with 1 ml formamide at 55 ÂºC for 16 h.
Absorbance was taken at 620 nm.
Vascular leakage visualization with FITC-dextran
was achieved by an intravenous injection of 3 mg/mouse
FITC-dextran (40-kDa; Sigma Aldrich) 10 min before
capture of tumor. Tumors were then fixed briefly in 4%
paraformaldehyde and cryosections were made to observe
vascular leakage under fluorescence microscope.
Vessel perfusion was assessed with Hoechst dye
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Assessment of lung metastasis
Lungs from MMTV mice or B16BL6-injected mice
were captured after tracheal perfusion with PBS and
Tellyesniczkyâs fluid (100 ml 32% formalin and 50 ml
acetic acid; total volume 1 liter with 70% ethanol) [47]
and were placed in Tellyesniczkyâs fluid for 48 h. Then
the lungs were photographed and embedded in optimal
cutting temperature compound. Sections of 10 Âµm
thickness separated by a thickness of 100 Âµm were made
to cover whole lung and hematoxylin and eosin staining

occludin antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Korea),
rabbit anti-E-cadherin (1:1000; Abcam), rabbit antivimentin (1:1000; Abcam), and rabbit anti-Ang2 antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from
ThermoScientific (Rockford, IL). Protein bands were
detected with ECL Western blotting detection kit
(Amersham Biosciences, San Francisco, CA) according
to the manufacturerâs instructions.

Cell culture
The human cancer cell lines MCF-7 and HeLa were
obtained from Prof. Han-Woong Lee (Yonsei University,
Korea). The human cell line A549 and the mouse cancer
cell lines B16F10 and LLC were purchased from American
Type Cell Culture, B16BL6 cell line was purchased from
Korean cell line bank (80006), and human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated from human
umbilical cords according to the established protocol [48].
Tumor cells (B16F10, B16BL6, LLC, MCF-7, HeLa) were
cultured in Dulbeccoâs modified Eagle medium (DMEM;
Gibco 11995) containing 4.5 g/L glucose, and A549 cells
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco 11875).
Both media were suppleÂ­mented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; HyClone SH30919.03) and 1% penicillin
streptomycin (Gibco 15140). HUVECs were cultured
in 2% gelatin-coated dishes with endothelial cell basal
medium (CC-3156) supplemented with EGM-2 kit (CC4176; Clonetics, Lonza Walkersville) and 20% FBS;
these cells were used through passage 7. All cells were
maintained in a 37Â°C incubator with 5% carbon dioxide.

Real time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from MMTV breast tumor
samples using RNeasy Plus Universal kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturerâs instructions. cDNA
was synthesized and real time PCR was performed on a
pikoreal 96 machine (Thermo Scientific) using Maxima
SYBR green qPCR master mix (Thermo Scientific).
Gene-specific primers were used at a final concentration
of 0.5 ÂµM and their sequences are listed in Supplementary
Table S2. All qPCR assays were performed in triplicates
in at least three independent experiments using 2 different
samples.

FACS

Cell proliferation assay

Fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS) of
mammary tumor cells was performed as described
previously [6]. Briefly, mammary gland tumors were
harvested from 14-week old MMTV mice and chopped.
Tumor tissues were digested with collagenase type 4 (1mg/
ml; Worthington) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%
FBS and DNase (0.01mg/ml; Sigma) for 20 min at 37â.
The cell suspension was then passed through a 35 Âµm filter
and the flow-through was adjusted to a cell density of 1.5
million cells/ml. Cells were then stained with PE/Cy7anti-CD44 (IM7; eBiosciences) and PE-anti-Sca-1 (D7;
BioLegend) antibodies and subjected to sorting. Live/
Dead fixable dead cell Stain kit (Invitrogen) was used
to remove the dead cell population. Flow cytometry was
performed by FACSCanto II (BD Bioscience) and data
was analyzed using Flowjo software (Tree Star).

Cell proliferation was determined with the
colorimetric
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as previously
described [49]. Briefly, B16F10, MCF7, HeLa, and A549
cells were seeded into 24 well plates (2Ã104 cells/well)
in 0.5 ml DMEM containing 10% FBS. The medium was
replaced the next day with serum-free DMEM containing
Sac-1004 (0.1â40 Âµg/ml) or the vehicle control (DMSO).
After 48 h, 10 Âµl MTT (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to the
medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 4
h. Finally, the medium was removed, and the formazan
crystals were dissolved in 200 Âµl DMSO: ethanol (1:1).
Absorbance was measured at 570 nm.

Western blot

Statistical analysis

Western blot analysis was carried out as previously
described [17]. Retina or cell samples were homogenized
in RIPA buffer using a sonicator and the lysates were
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min to collect the
supernatant. For tumor specimens, 1 mm3 tissue was
homogenized in RIPA buffer and centrifuged. Proteins
obtained from the supernatants were electrophoresed
on 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The primary
antibodies used to visualize protein bands were goat antiVE-cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit antiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

All statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism (version 5.0; GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, CA). Tests for statistical significance were
two-sided, and probability values less than 0.05 were
considered significant. The Studentâs t-test or ANOVA was
used to compare mean values, and results are presented as
mean Â± SEM or SD.
