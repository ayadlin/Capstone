Autologous Ectopic Grafting of Cryopreserved Testicular
Tissue Preserves the Fertility of Prepubescent Monkeys That
Receive Sterilizing Cytotoxic Therapy

Abstract
Boys faced with future sterility as a result of the need of a sterilizing cancer therapy might avoid this fate by
engraftment of cryopreserved immature testicular tissue after therapy is completed. Efforts to address this
important survivorship issue have been encouraged by reports of the long-term survival and proliferation of
human spermatogonia after xenotransplant of cryopreserved immature testicular tissue into immunocompromised murine hosts. However, spermatogenic arrest at the pachytene spermatocyte stage that occurs in this
situation has been associated with a failure in sperm production. In this study, we used a prepubescent simian
model to address the possibility that testicular tissue engraftment is insufÔ¨Åciently supported in the model to allow
suitable maturation of germ cells. BrieÔ¨Çy, we carried out autologous orthotopic grafting of cryopreserved
testicular tissue from four prepubescent monkeys and one pubescent rhesus monkey after testicular irradiation
and castration of the host animal. Five months after implantation of scrotal grafts, we determined that 3% to 7% of
the autografts could be recovered with spermatogenesis proceeding through spermatozoa formation in 13% to
17% of the seminiferous tubules formed in the grafts. In contrast, Sertoli cell-only tubules were detected in parallel
xenografts transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Our results show that cryopreservation of testicular
tissue from prepubescent primates can maintain the fully functional capacity of spermatogonia to produce
sperm, but that host conditions are critical for spermatogenic maturation. Furthermore, our results establish an
initial perspective on the quantity of cryopreserved material needed to ensure success in preserving fertility
through testicular tissue grafts. Cancer Res; 72(20); 5174‚Äì8. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Prepubertal boys facing a sterilizing cancer therapy cannot
beneÔ¨Åt from sperm banking. A potential alternative strategy
for preserving their fertility involves cryopreservation of immature testicular tissue (1‚Äì3). Studies with nonhuman primates
have revealed that fresh prepubertal testicular tissue survives
well when xenografted into nude mice, and is able to differentiate to full spermatogenesis (4, 5). The testicular tissue can
be removed from the grafting site, and sperm can be retrieved
from the tissue. Xenogenic rhesus sperm generated in host

mice have shown to be fertilization competent, allowing in vitro
embryo development (4). This is contrary to adult testicular
tissue that undergoes almost complete degeneration after
grafting (6, 7).
Successful long-term survival and proliferation of human
spermatogonia has been reported after xenografting of cryopreserved immature testicular tissue (8‚Äì10). However, these
studies have failed to conÔ¨Årm the preservation of the functionality of spermatogonial stem cells in the cryopreserved
tissues. Spermatogenic arrest at the pachytene spermatocyte
stage occurred in cryopreserved testicular tissue for both
humans and rhesus monkeys after xenotransplantation into
an immunodeÔ¨Åcient murine host (1, 9). Maximal preservation
of spermatogonial stem cells in functional testicular tissue and
an adequate transplantation or xenografting procedure are key
factors to guarantee success of future fertility preservation
approaches using testicular tissue transplantation and xenografting. In the terms of fertility preservation, all previous
grafting strategies may be considered unsuccessful.
The reasons why the outcome after grafting of cryopreserved
human and monkey xenografts has been poor, so far, remain
unknown. It is possible that the cryopreservation protocols
were not optimal and that the xenografting is leading to
incomplete germ cell maturation due to differences between
host and donor gonadotropic hormones (11), local testosterone levels within xenografts, or incompatibilities between the

primate germ cells and the murine-supporting Sertoli cells
(4, 12). Many, thus far, unexplored factors may affect success of
germ differentiation in xenografted primate testis tissues. The
effects of cold and warm ischemia before the reestablishment
of blood supply to the grafts may also have relevant impact and
to be explored would have required short-term studies. Warm
ischemia may well depend on the site of grafting due to
different degrees of vascularization at various grafting sites.
To evaluate if autologous grafting might serve as a fertility
preservation method after testicular irradation and (hemi)
castration, ectopic autologous grafting of cryopreserved testicular tissues from prepubertal and pubertal rhesus monkeys
was used. Spermatogenic differentiation in autologous grafts
was compared with that in xenografts in immunodeÔ¨Åcient
mouse host.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Five male rhesus monkeys aged 30 to 49 months (Macaca
mulatta) from the University of Pittsburgh Plum Boro primate
facility (Pittsburgh, PA) were used for the study. All animal
experiments were approved by and carried out under the
guidance of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. This study is
a continuation of an irradiation study reported earlier (3).
Testicular biopsy and graft cryopreservation
One of the testes in each animal was biopsied under general
anesthesia using isoÔ¨Çurane. In one monkey (#3199), unilateral
orchidectomy was carried out. At the time of tissue collection,
the testicular tissue from donor monkeys #3199, #3082, #3213,
and #3117 consisted of seminiferous cords with preleptotene
spermatocytes as the most advanced germ cell type and donor
monkey #3212 showed full spermatogenesis as described earlier (3). The collected testicular tissue was dissected into small
fragments (1 mm3). Altogether, 140 tissue fragments from
monkey #3199; 10 fragments from monkeys #3082, #3212, and
#3213; and 5 fragments from monkey #3117 were cryopreserved for tissue grafting experiment. Tissue fragments were
kept in Dulbecco's ModiÔ¨Åed Eagle's Medium high glucose
(4 g/L) containing 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino
acids, and antibiotics on ice. Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was
added dropwise to the suspension to a Ô¨Ånal concentration of
1.4 mol/L. The tissue fragments were then transferred into
cryovials and submitted to a slow-freezing protocol (1).
Six weeks later, in March 2006, testicular irradiation was
carried out at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
Presbyterian Hospital. The animals were castrated in March
and April 2008, except monkey #3117, which was castrated in
October 2008.
Autologous grafting
In June 2008, the testicular grafts were thawed in 37 C water
bath for 2 minutes and were washed in fresh ice-cold medium.
By using cancer implant G13 needle (Popper Precision Instruments), 5 testicular fragments were placed subcutaneously
into the left side of the scrotum, and 5 under the skin on the left

shoulder for monkeys #3082, #3212, and #3213. In monkey
#3199, 30 testicular fragments were placed into the left side of
the scrotum and 30 into the right side. Also 30 grafts each were
placed subcutaneously on the shoulder and left arm. In monkey
#3117, 5 grafts were placed subcutaneously on the left shoulder
only. Five months later, in October 2008, monkeys were fully
anesthetized again, and the grafts were dissected from under
the skin and Ô¨Åxed in Bouins solution overnight.
Xenografting
Three adult (10‚Äì15 weeks old) immunodeÔ¨Åcient male nude
mice (Crl:Nu/Nu-nuBR; Charles River Laboratories) were used
as recipients. Mice were castrated and 6 testicular fragments
from monkey #3199 were placed in each mouse under the
dorsal skin on either side of the dorsal midline by using cancer
implant G13 needle (Popper Precision Instruments). Five
months later, the mice were anesthetized and killed by exsanguination. The back skin was removed and grafts were dissected from the skin and Ô¨Åxed in Bouins solution.
Histology
The grafts were Ô¨Åxed for 18 to 24 hours and, washed and
stored in 70% ethanol, and embedded in parafÔ¨Ån for serial
sectioning at 4 mm throughout the entire graft. Tissue
sections were stained with periodic acid-Schiff's reagent
and Gill's hematoxylin and examined under the light microscope. Graft survival was deÔ¨Åned by light microscopic
observation of seminiferous tubules with Sertoli cells in the
retrieved graft. The serial section showing best tissue survival was selected for analysis. The tubular diameter, fertility
index (FI; percentage proportion of tubules containing spermatogonia), spermatogenic repopulation index (percentage
proportion of tubules containing B-spermatogonia ore more
advanced germ cell types), most advanced germ cell type,
and percentage of tubules with the most advanced germ cell
type were recorded in 50 tubular cross sections selected for
analysis by random systematic sampling. All cross sections
of seminiferous tubules were analyzed from smaller grafts,
which did not contain 50 tubular cross sections. The identiÔ¨Åcation of type A dark (Ad) and A pale (Ap) spermatogonia
followed the scheme of Clermont and Leblond (13). The light
microscopic determinations were conducted by one observer (K. Jahnukainen).

Results
Graft survival
Five months after autologous grafting, 5% (8/155) of the
cryopreserved grafts were recovered. No difference in graft
survival was detected between different grafting sites. Altogether, 7% grafts (5/75) from scrotal, 4% (2/50) from shoulder,
and 3% (1/30) from arm contained active testicular tissue.
Survival of xenografts in the back skin of immunodeÔ¨Åcient
mice was 6% (1/18) for the same time period.
Histologic evaluation of spermatogenic recovery
Five months after autologous grafting in the scrotum, 2 of 5
recovered grafts showed fully matured spermatogenesis (Fig.

spermatids and pachytene spermatocytes as the most
advanced germ cell stages. Each graft that was recovered from
other locations than from scrotal skin showed some germ cell
maturation. However, maturation in these grafts did not reach
beyond pachytene spermatocyte stage. The surviving xenograft
that was recovered from immunodeÔ¨Åcient mouse showed
Sertoli cell-only (SCO) pattern and no germ cells. Table 1
summarizes the basic morphometric data of the recovered
grafts.
In all autologous grafts, a morphologically normal interstitium with blood vessels, macrophages, peritubular, and Leydig

cells was detected (Fig. 1A). The recovered xenograft showed
interstitial inÔ¨Åltration with macrophages (Fig. 1C).

Discussion
The present results provide Ô¨Årst unequivocal evidence that
cryopreservation of prepubertal primate testicular tissue
maintains the functional capacity of spermatogonia and testicular tissue to produce sperm after grafting. Spermatogenesis
up to level of spermatozoa was detected in the cryopreserved
grafts autologously grafted into scrotal skin of the rhesus
monkey. Testicular tissue that produced sperm was cryopreserved at the time when the donor has still been prepubertal

Sperm Production in Cryopreserved Primate Autograft

(3). Grafting was carried out 2 years later when the donor was
adult, but sterile, because of the effects of testicular irradiation
and bilateral castration. Transferring our experimental scenario into a clinical setting, 2 subcutaneous testicular grafts
containing seminiferous tubules with spermatozoa would have
easily enabled assisted reproductive technology specialists to
obtain sperm by testicular sperm extraction and to conduct
intracellular sperm injection. Therefore, our study reveals a
proof-of-principle for fertility preservation via grafting of testicular tissue in a sterile patient.
A major factor that guaranteed successful outcome by
autologous grafting was the large number of cryopreserved
grafts available in monkey #3199. Survival of the grafted tissue
was low (3%‚Äì7%) independent of the site where the grafts were
placed. Only the removal of one entire testis by hemicastration
provided sufÔ¨Åcient material to collect sperm. Altogether, 110
testicular fragments were cryopreserved from this single prepubertal testis. From the other 5 donors, small biopsies (20‚Äì40
mg of tissue) were collected and only 5 to 10 tissue fragments
were cryopreserved. One of these donors had surviving testicular grafts but these did not contain fully matured sperm. No
grafts were recovered from the donor that had shown intiation
of puberty and spermarche before the cryopreservation of
grafts (3). Present observations are in accordance with a
previous autologous grafting experiment with marmoset using
a low number of autologous grafts (14). None of the 7 cryopreserved grafts retransplanted in each marmoset were recovered after a 10-month period. A large amount of testicular
tissue is therefore a critical factor to guarantee success of future
fertility preservation with testicular tissue transplantation.
In this study, spermatogenic maturation beyond meiosis
was seen only when ectopic autologous grafting was carried
out into the scrotum. This was observed in all 3 grafts with
good germ cell survival (FI, 43%‚Äì50%). Two other scrotal grafts
with lower spermatogonial survival (FI, 2%‚Äì6%) had germ cell
development up to the pachytene spermatocyte stage. All
subcutaneous grafts from other locations showed some degree
of spermatogenic recovery but did not develop beyond meiosis.
This was despite good survival of spermatogonia (FI, 26%‚Äì
44%). Our observations are in accordance with the previous
autologous grafting study where grafting under the back skin
was shown to contribute to spermatogenetic arrest but grafting into the scrotum allowed maturation (14). As previously
hypothesized hyperthermia in back skin may be one of the
factors responsible for the detected spermatogenic arrest. In
this study, no autologous graft with Sertoli cell-only pattern
was recovered and in most of the grafts, the spermatogenetic
repopulation index was high (20%‚Äì70%). Thus, a signiÔ¨Åcant
part of surviving grafts showed potential to support spermatogenesis and more SCO tubules would most probably be repopulated with increased grafting time. Our results reveal that
cryopreserved autografts survive with an all or nothing pattern.
The loss of grafts seems to be the only limiting factor for fertility
preservation procedures.
Further studies are needed to explore the reasons for graft
disappearance that could be related to the cryopreservation
protocol, the ectopic grafting site, graft rejection, or inÔ¨Çammation-like responses eventually induced by ischemia-induced

death of cells in the grafts. Cryopreservation of testicular tissue
requires adequate penetration of cryoprotectants through the
seminiferous tubular membranes and barriers. A slow-cooling
protocol using DMSO supplemented with sucrose and human
serum albumin enabled survival of human xenografts in a
short-term study (15). Improved survival of primate autografts will require further research on optimal protein support
and concentrations of cryoprotectants in freezing solution as
well as methods for adequate thawing, comparable to studies
with ovarian tissue (16, 17). New grafting techniques that
promote a fast and efÔ¨Åcient graft revascularization will also
be required. Orthotopic transplantation into an intratesticular location offers potentially intensive circulation and hormonal support to the testicular grafts (18). Also, other wellvascularized grafting locations such as muscle or kidney
capsule could be selected to decrease posttransplantation
anoxia as shown in the studies with ovarian grafts (19). It is
also possible that host or gonadal grafts will be treated with
hormones, growth factors, or biologic substances (such as
vascular endothelial growth factor) to enhance graft vascularization (20).
Cryopreserved testicular grafts from rhesus monkey (#3199)
showed very poor survival as xenograft. Only Sertoli cell-only
tubules were detected in 1 surviving graft out of 18. The
observed graft survival rate of 6% in immunocompromised
mice is low compared with 73% previously reported using
similar testicular material, freezing program, cryopreservation
media, and follow-up time (1). Interstitial inÔ¨Åltration of macrophages was detected suggesting that the host immunoreaction
may have affected graft survival and caused death of germ cells.
Macrophage activation in the nude mice must be regarded as a
factor that potentially affects the probability of spermatogenesis in primate testicular grafts. Macrophage activation can
potentially be avoided by using more immunocompromised
severe combined immunodeÔ¨Åcient mice in future studies. In
the present experimental setting, xenografting presented inferior potential for fertility preservation for this particular sterilized donor.
In conclusion, we were able to provide the proof-of-principle that cryopreserved primate spermatogonial stem cells
and prepubertal testicular tissue have full functional capacity
to mature to sperm after grafting. Optimal transplantation
conditions were shown to be critical for maturation capacity.
In this study, this was provided by autologous grafting of
cryopreserved tissue into the scrotum. The observations
provide valuable evidence that spermatogenic arrest
reported previously in human testicular tissue (8‚Äì10) might
be more associated to the xenografting method used than to
the lack of spermatogenetic potential in the cryopreserved
human tissue. We expect that an improvement of grafting
strategies will open scenarios for clinical use of testicular
tissue transplantation (1, 21, 22). The most promising
approach will most probably involve autologous grafting of
immature testicular tissue, stored before gonadotoxic therapy for nonmalignant pathologies or cautiously nonhematologic and nonmetastasizing cancers (1, 21, 22). For the other
patients, testicular samples should be cryobanked after careful counseling.
