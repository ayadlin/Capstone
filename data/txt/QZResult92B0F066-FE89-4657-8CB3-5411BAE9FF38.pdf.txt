alterations, such as endonuclease-mediated DNA fragmentation
and externalization of phosphatidylserine, underlie the phenotypic
changes. Considered a ‘‘physiologic cell suicide’’ program, apoptosis
is involved in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and
immune system function. Disturbances in apoptosis contribute to
numerous diseases, including cancer (9–11).
Mediated by a family of cysteine proteases known as caspases, two
distinct pathways characterize apoptotic processes. The extrinsic
pathway that is triggered by death receptors, such as FAS or the
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor with their respective ligands,
results in caspase-8 activation. In response to growth factor
withdrawal, hypoxia, or DNA damage, the intrinsic pathway is
initiated, resulting in cytochrome c release, loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential (7), and the apoptosome formation, a complex
consisting of cytochrome c, apoptotic protease-activating factor-1
(Apaf-1), and procaspase-9 (9, 12). Both pathways converge at the
level of caspase-3, an effector caspase that leads to the typical
morphologic and biochemical changes of the apoptotic cell. Tumor
cells express several proteins that suppress apoptosis. Functional
interactions of those proteins in apoptosis pathways are therefore of
particular interest. Among them, the antiapoptotic members of the
Bcl-2 protein family, members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein
family, and heat shock proteins (Hsp) play a major role (9, 13).
Hsps are a protein family with a highly conserved structure. They
are present in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and act in
fundamental cellular processes. Originally, they were discovered in
cells after exposure to elevated temperatures and thus were called
Hsps. But other cellular stress factors, such as hypoxia, sodium
arsenite, and virus transformation, can also induce synthesis of
Hsps. Because stress proteins associate with denatured or partially
unfolded proteins and protect them from further denaturation,
they belong to the superfamily of chaperones (14). Based on their
molecular weight and sequence homology, Hsps are classified into
different families. A very prominent and well-characterized
subgroup of Hsps is the Hsp70 family. It encompasses isoforms
ranging from 66 to 78 kDa that are encoded by a multigene family
consisting of at least 11 distinct genes in humans (15, 16).
Eukaryotic Hsp70s contain two functional domains: an NH2terminal ATP-binding domain and a COOH-terminal substratebinding domain. Both domains act interdependently (17, 18).
A subset of the Hsp70 family, the heat shock cognate proteins
(Hsc70, also known as Hsp73), is constitutively expressed under
normal physiologic conditions and found within all the major
intracellular compartments. Another isoform is stress inducible
(also called Hsp72) and distributed predominantly in the
cytoplasm, nucleus, and plasma membrane of various tumor cells
(19, 20). Besides its essential role in cell survival under stressful
conditions, Hsp72 is involved in numerous pathologic conditions,
such as neurodegenerative diseases and ischemia (21), inflammatory processes, and immunogenicity (22).

Abstract
Pancreatic carcinoma is a malignant disease that responds
poorly to chemotherapy because of its resistance to apoptosis.
Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are not only cytoprotective but also
interfere with the apoptotic cascade. Here, we investigated the
role of Hsp70 in regulating apoptosis in pancreatic cancer
cells. Hsp70 expression was increased in pancreatic cancer
cells compared with normal pancreatic ductal cells. This was
confirmed by increased mRNA levels for Hsp70 in human
pancreatic cancer tissue compared with neighboring normal
tissue from the same patient. Depletion of Hsp70 by quercetin
decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis in cancer
cells but not in normal pancreatic ductal cells. To show that
this is a specific effect of Hsp70 on apoptosis, levels of Hsp70
were knocked down by short interfering RNA treatment,
which also induced apoptosis in cancer cells as indicated by
Annexin V staining and caspase activation. Daily administration of quercetin to nude mice decreased tumor size as well
as Hsp70 levels in tumor tissue. These findings indicate that
Hsp70 plays an important role in apoptosis and that selective
Hsp70 knockdown can be used to induce apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(2):616–25]

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common malignant
diseases in the Western world and has the lowest 5-year survival
rate of any cancer (1, 2). Ten percent to 15% of patients undergo
potentially curative pancreatic surgery; however, radical surgery
does not substantially improve survival (3). Nearly 90% of
pancreatic neoplasms are adenocarcinomas arising from the
exocrine ductal system (4). It is generally believed that cancer
cells have an altered cell physiology comprising abundance of
growth signals, insensitivity to all cycle arrest signals, and evasion
from programmed cell death (apoptosis). Unresponsiveness to
apoptotic stimuli can result in tumor progression and resistance to
most oncologic therapies (5).
Cell death can occur in two main forms, apoptosis and necrosis,
each with its own morphologic and biochemical manifestations
(6–8). Apoptosis is formally defined by the appearance of distinct
morphologic changes, including membrane blebbing, chromatin
condensation, and fragmentation of the nucleus. Biochemical

tissue from the same patient using real-time quantitative PCR. RNA from
normal and tumor tissue from patients undergoing a pancreatoduodenectomy were obtained from Dr. Hiroomi Tada (University of Massachusetts
Medical School, Worcester, MA). RNA was treated with DNase I. Total
cellular RNA (1 Ag) was reverse transcribed. Predeveloped Taqman gene
expression assays (primers and probe labeled with FAM) were used to
quantitate the amount of Hsp70. The Taqman endogenous control was a
predesigned probe and primer set for human 18S, which was labeled with
VIC. All data were normalized to 18S expression.
Immunolocalization of Hsp70. Pancreatic tumor cells were plated on
chamber slides and kept overnight. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 30 min and then washed twice with PBS. Immunostaining for Hsp70 was
then done as described previously (26).
Transfection of siRNA. Double-stranded Hsp72 siRNA duplex was
dissolved in a buffer [20 mmol/L KCl, 6 mmol/L HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5),
0.2 mmol/L MgCl2] to a final concentration of 75 mmol/L. The sense strand
(siRNA #1) was 5¶-GGACAUCAGCCAGAACAAGdTdT-3¶ and the antisense
strand was 5¶-CUUGUUCUGGCUGAUGUCCdTdT-3¶ (27). An additional
siRNA sequence (siRNA #2) for Hsp70 was used to rule out any ‘‘off-target’’
effects (sense strand, 5¶-GCGAGAGGGUGUCAGCCAAUU-3¶; antisense
strand, 5¶-UUGGCUGACACCCUCUCGCUU-3¶). Scrambled nonsilencing
siRNA [5¶-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUdTdT-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAdTdT-3¶ (antisense) from Qiagen] bearing no relevant
homology with any relevant human gene served as a control.
For transfection, 105 cells were plated into 24-well plates and incubated
overnight. LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (10 AL) was added to 250 AL OptiMEM I medium and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Hsp72 or
control siRNA (100 nmol/L) was added and incubated for another 20 min.
A third set of transfections was done without any siRNA (mock
transfection). The transfection reagent/siRNA complex was added to the
wells containing 2 mL DMEM with 10% FBS and incubated for 5 h at 37jC
until medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. Assays were
done at 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection.
Determination of cell viability. Cell viability was determined by the
Dojindo Cell Counting Kit-8. Cells were split into a 96-well plate at 104 per
well and allowed to adhere overnight. After treatment with quercetin and
dihydroquercetin at various concentrations for 24 h, 10 AL of the tetrazolium
substrate were inoculated to each well of the plate. Plates were incubated at
37jC for 2 h and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. All experiments
were done in triplicate and repeated at least twice.
To determine the effect of Hsp70-specific siRNA on pancreatic cancer cell
viability, the cells were transfected as described above, and 12 h after
transfection, the cells were passaged with equal number of cells (104) per
well of a 96-well plate. After 72 h post transfection, 10 AL of the tetrazolium
substrate was added to each well and absorbance was measured as
described above.
Caspase activity assays. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities were
measured by a fluorometric assay in whole-cell lysates using Ac-DEVDMCA substrate for caspase-3 and Ac-LEHD-MCA substrate for caspase-9.
A total of 5  105 cells for caspase-3 assay and 106 cells for caspase-9 assay
was lysed and sonicated in a buffer composed of 250 mmol/L sucrose,
5 mmol/L MOPS (pH 6.5), and 1 mmol/L MgSO4. Fluorescence was measured in 1 mL of assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris base (pH 8.1), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L CaCl2, 10 mmol/L DTT, and 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum
albumin] supplemented with 100 AL of protein lysates and incubated with
100 AL of caspase substrate (200 nmol/L). Cleavage of caspase substrate
results in the release of methylcholanthrene, which emits a fluorescent
signal with wavelengths of 380 nm excitation and 440 nm emission.
Measurement of Annexin V–positive cells. Phosphatidylserine externalization was analyzed using the Guava Nexin kit. Briefly, 5  105 cells
were washed with PBS and adjusted in 1 binding buffer to a concentration
of 5  105/mL. To 40 AL of cell suspension, 5 AL of Annexin V-phycoerythrin
and 5 AL 7-aminoactinomycin D were added and incubated for 20 min at
room temperature. Samples were analyzed (2,000 events) on a Guava PCA
flow cytometer.

We have shown in the past that inducible Hsp70 is critically
involved in the protection against cellular injury in pancreatic
acinar cells (23, 24). In the present study, we have studied whether
Hsp70 is involved in the resistance to apoptosis of pancreatic
cancer cells, a cell type resembling pancreatic duct cells rather than
acinar cells. Our approach was to assess the expression of Hsp70 in
pancreatic tumor cells and compare it to nontumorous pancreatic
ductal cells. Based on those findings, we show induction of
apoptosis after inhibition of Hsp70 in tumor cells by quercetin and
no apoptosis when the inactive analogue dihydroquercetin is used.
Hsp72-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) also induced
apoptosis via a selective down-regulation of the inducible form of
Hsp70. These findings identify an essential role of Hsp70 in the
resistance to apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells.

siRNA was from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). All other reagents were
from Sigma. Pancreatic cancer cells were a kind gift from Dr. Edward E.
Whang (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston,
MA). Mouse pancreatic ductal cells (primary isolates) were a kind gift from
Dr. Anil K. Rustgi (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA).
Cell culture. Pancreatic cancer cells were cultured in DMEM containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Mouse
pancreatic ductal cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) with 5 mg/L
D-glucose, 0.1 mg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor type I, 5 mL/L insulin,
transferrin, and selenium, 25 Ag/mL bovine pituitary extract, 5 nmol/L
3,3¶,5-triiodo-L-thyronine, 1 Amol/L dexamethasone, 1.22 mg/mL nicotinamide, 5% Nu-Serum, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. All cells were maintained at 37jC in a humidified air
atmosphere with 5% CO2.
Quercetin and dihydroquercetin treatment. Cells were plated in a sixwell plate at a density of 5  105 and kept overnight. For detecting cell
viability, cells were split into 96-well plates using 104 per well. Quercetin
or dihydroquercetin (an inactive analogue of quercetin) was dissolved in
DMSO and added to the medium with final concentrations from 25 to
200 Amol/L. Cells were incubated at 37jC for 24 h. Cells treated with DMSO
alone [<0.2% (ref. 25)] served as controls.
Measurement of Hsp70 levels by Western blotting. Cell lysates were
prepared by resuspending cells in lysis buffer [65 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP40, 1% sodium deoxycholate,
1 Ag/mL aprotinin, 100 Ag/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride] for 30 min at
4jC and cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000  g. Supernatants
were collected and stored at 80jC until used. Total protein concentration
was determined using Trace/DMA Microprotein kit. Western blotting for
Hsp70 was done as previously described using a monoclonal antibody
(mAb) from Stressgen, which binds to the epitope corresponding to the
common amino acid residues 436 to 503 of the human and mouse protein
(26). Equal protein loading was confirmed by staining with Ponceau S [0.1%
Ponceau S (w/v) in 5% acetic acid (v/v)]. Actin expression was used as an
internal control.

cells were cultured on chamber slides. Cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 25jC. Permeabilization of
cells was achieved by incubation with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium
citrate for 2 min on ice. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was then carried out
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche). Signal conversion was
achieved using an anti-fluorescein antibody conjugated with alkaline
phosphatase, and methyl green was used as a counterstain.
Induction of s.c. tumors in nude mice. To determine the effect of
quercetin on pancreatic tumor growth in vivo, 4  106 MiaPaCa-2 cells were
injected s.c. into the right mediodorsal flank of 6-week-old male nude mice.
Once the tumors reached a measurable size, animals were randomized into
a control group (daily injection of vehicle; DMSO in PBS) and quercetin
group (daily injection of 50 mg/kg quercetin). Animals were killed with
carbon dioxide after 18 days. The tumor size was determined with a caliper,
and the tumor volume was calculated by using the formula (a  b  c) / 2,
where a and b are the shorter and longer diameter of the tumors and c is
the depth. Tumor growth was calculated as percentage increase of initial
tumor volume before the start of the treatment. Tumors were removed and
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were then homogenized, and total
proteins were extracted for analysis of Hsp70 by Western blot as outlined
above. All experiments with animals were approved by the animal care and
use committee at the University of Massachusetts.

Hsp70 is elevated in pancreatic cancer cells. Using a mAb for
the inducible form of Hsp70, we showed the expression of Hsp70 in
all tested pancreatic cancer cell lines. Compared with normal
nonmalignant pancreatic ductal cells, the levels in all cancer cells
were notably higher (Fig. 1A). Actin expression was used to ensure
equal protein loading. Real-time PCR confirmed the Western blot
data showing increased Hsp70 mRNA expression in Panc-1 cells
compared with normal pancreatic duct cells (data not shown). The
normalizing gene 18S was similar for both cell types.
Immunocytochemical staining of BxPC-3 cells and normal
pancreatic ductal cells revealed higher cytosolic expression of
Hsp70 in the tumor cell line (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained
with the other pancreatic cancer cell lines MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1
(data not shown). Hsp70-positive staining was already detectable
under the 10 objective in BxPC-3 cells. The 40 objective
revealed Hsp70 expression in the cytosol and indicated moderate
staining of nuclei. No significant staining was detected in healthy
pancreatic ductal cells or negative controls. In addition, the above
data were supported by the fact that Hsp70 mRNA levels were

Hsp70 and Pancreatic Cancer

Figure 2. Quercetin decreases Hsp70 expression in pancreatic cancer
cells resulting in decreased cell viability. MiaPaCa-2 (A ), Panc-1 (B ),
and normal pancreatic duct cells (C) cells were incubated with various
concentrations of quercetin/dihydroquercetin. Top, Western blots for
Hsp70; bottom, cell viability data. Protein lysate (10 Ag) was used for
Western blotting. Equal protein loading was confirmed by staining
membranes with Ponceau S and reprobing for actin. DMSO served
as a vehicle for quercetin and dihydroquercetin. Final concentrations of
DMSO never exceeded 0.2%. Cell viability was assessed by measuring
absorbance at 450 nm on a 96-well plate reader. Decreased viability was
found after treatment with quercetin for 24 h. Dihydroquercetin did not show
any alterations in cell viability. Normal pancreatic duct cells (C ) did not
show any alterations in cell viability by either flavonoid.

resulted in no change in Hsp70 in any of the examined pancreatic
cancer cell lines (Fig. 2A and B). This leads us to conclude that
dihydroquercetin does not down-regulate Hsp70 expression in
pancreatic tumor cells.
Next, the effect of quercetin and dihydroquercetin on cell
viability was assessed. In all tested tumor cells, the presence of
quercetin reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner,
whereas dihydroquercetin (which does not inhibit Hsp70 expression) had no effect (Fig. 2). Supplementation of medium with 0.2%
DMSO had no effect on cell proliferation. Interestingly, both Panc-1
and MiaPaCa-2 had decreased viability by >50% when incubated
with 100 Amol/L quercetin. Incubation of normal pancreatic ductal
cells with either quercetin or dihydroquercetin had no effect on
cell viability (Fig. 2C). Given that normal pancreatic ductal cells
had much lower Hsp70 levels when compared with the tumor cells
(Fig. 1A), this confirms that quercetin promoted cell death by
inhibiting Hsp70 levels.
Hsp70 inhibition stimulates apoptosis in pancreatic cancer
cells. Apoptosis can be assessed by using several characteristic
features of programmed cell death. One variable of apoptosis is
phosphatidylserine externalization, which can be measured by

significantly higher in human pancreatic tumor tissue compared
with normal tissue from the same patients (Fig. 1C).
Hsp70 down-regulation by quercetin decreases proliferation
of pancreatic cancer cells. Incubation of pancreatic cancer cells in
medium supplemented with various concentrations of the flavonoid
quercetin led to a dose-dependent reduction of Hsp70 expression,
whereas tumor cells exposed to dihydroquercetin did not show any
alterations. Figure 2A and B shows a decrease of Hsp70 levels in
MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells after treatment with different concentrations of quercetin for 24 h. Figure 2C shows that treatment of
normal pancreatic duct cells with either quercetin or dihydroquercetin had no effect on Hsp70 levels. Incubation of cells with 0.2%
DMSO, used as a vehicle, had no effect on Hsp70 expression.
In our experiments, incubation of Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells
with at least 50 Amol/L quercetin led to a notable reduction of at
least 50% of Hsp70 as assessed by Western blot (Fig. 2A and B). In
BxPC-3 cells, Hsp70 levels were also reduced (data not shown). The
higher concentrations of quercetin (i.e., 100 and 200 Amol/L)
inhibited Hsp70 expression to a greater extent than the lower concentrations, suggesting a dose-dependent effect on Hsp70 expression. In contrast, incubation with dihydroquercetin (25–200 Amol/L)

repeated the experiment with an additional Hsp70-specific siRNA
(siRNA #2), which confirmed that Hsp70 expression in MiaPaCa-2
cells was inhibited to a similar extent after 72 h (Fig. 6E).
Next, we assessed the effect of Hsp70-specific siRNA on cell
viability. Inhibition of Hsp70 using siRNA (siRNA #1) significantly
decreased cell viability in both MiaPaCa-2 (% of mock: 57.4 F 2.3)
and Panc-1 (% of mock: 54.1 F 3.1) cells. A similar result was also
found with an additional siRNA (siRNA #2) in MiaPaCa-2 (Fig. 6E).
We assessed the extent of apoptosis at 24, 48, and 72 h after
incubation with siRNA by Annexin V staining and caspase
measurement. Transfection of MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells with
Hsp70 siRNA after 48 and 72 h significantly increased Annexin V–
positive cells (Fig. 5B and C ). In contrast, only a slight
enhancement in the number of Annexin V–positive cells was
detected after the first 24 h after transfection (at a time when
Hsp70 expression had decreased only slightly). An f2.5-fold
increase in Annexin V–positive cells resulted after 72 h of
treatment with siRNA specific for Hsp70 in both MiaPaCa-2 and
Panc-1 cells. Transfections with scrambled siRNA serving as a
control did not show any alterations in Annexin V–stained cells,
thus showing that Hsp70 siRNA was responsible for initiating
apoptosis in pancreatic tumor cells. To rule out any ‘‘off-target’’
effects of the siRNA, we repeated this experiment with an
additional Hsp70-specific siRNA sequence (siRNA #2) with
MiaPaCa-2 cells and found similar results (Fig. 6E). This increase
in apoptosis was accompanied by increased activity of caspases.
Hsp70 siRNA induced a notable increase in caspase-3 activity in

The effect of quercetin and dihydroquercetin on caspase-3
(effector caspase) and caspase-9 (initiator caspase) activation was
examined. Quercetin increased caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities
in both MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells, whereas dihydroquercetin had
no effect on caspases (Fig. 4). Treatment of Panc-1 cells with
50 Amol/L quercetin for 24 h led to a >4-fold increase in caspase-3
and a 2-fold increase in caspase-9. MiaPaCa-2 cells incubated with
quercetin resulted in a 6.9-fold elevation of caspase-3 and a 3.6-fold
increase in caspase-9 compared with incubation with dihydroquercetin. Elevated caspase levels were already apparent after
12 h of treatment with quercetin. The above data suggest that
quercetin, which decreases Hsp70 expression, is capable of
initiating apoptotic cell death in pancreatic cancer cells.
Hsp70-specific siRNA promotes apoptosis in pancreatic
cancer cells. To confirm the effects of Hsp70 expression on
apoptosis and exclude any non-Hsp70-related effects of flavonoids,
we transfected pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells with doublestranded siRNA oligonucleotides. Cells were harvested at 24, 48,
and 72 h after transfection, and Hsp70 expression was analyzed by
Western blot (Fig. 5A). Whereas Hsp70-specific siRNA (siRNA #1)
suppressed Hsp70 synthesis almost completely, control (scrambled)
siRNA had no effect on Hsp70 expression. A set of cells transfected

synthesis. Actin expression was unaffected by treatment with either

Figure 5. A, representative Western blot for Hsp70 after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment with Hsp70-specific siRNA or control siRNA. Additionally, a mock transfection
was done with buffer to exclude any nonspecific effects of the transfection reagent. Hsp70 siRNA induced marked suppression of Hsp70 expression in MiaPaCa-2 and
Panc-1, whereas actin expression was not affected. All experiments were done with 100 nmol/L final concentration of siRNA. Results are typical of three separate
experiments. B, Hsp70 siRNA enhances rate of apoptotic cells in MiaPaCa-2 and (C ) Panc-1. Cells were transfected with Hsp70 siRNA, control siRNA, or buffer
(mock), and rate of Annexin V–positive cells was measured after 24, 48, and 72 h. A final concentration of 100 nmol/L of siRNA was used for transfection, and 2,000
events were counted by flow cytometry. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SE. *, P < 0.05, compared with control siRNA was considered as statistically significant.

Inhibition of Hsp70 with both quercetin and siRNA resulted in
increased apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. In addition,
in vivo administration of quercetin decreased tumor size in a
xenograft nude mouse model of pancreatic cancer. This decrease in
tumor size was also associated with decreased Hsp70 levels in the
tumor.
The finding that pancreatic cancer cells expressed significantly
higher Hsp70 levels compared with nonmalignant ductal cells is an
important one because it suggests that Hsp70 plays a role in tumor
cell resistance to apoptosis. This in vitro finding is in accordance
with a report by Gress et al. (28) showing increased Hsp70 mRNA
levels in human pancreatic carcinomas (assessed by Northern blot
and in situ hybridization). In the present study, real-time PCR
confirmed these previous findings, showing increased Hsp70
expression in cancer tissue versus normal tissue from the same
pancreatic cancer patient. These findings agree with several reports
in the literature showing increased Hsp70 expression in a variety of
malignant tumors, such as colorectal, breast, and gastric cancer.
The importance of these findings is illustrated by the fact that high
levels of Hsp70 expression have been correlated with increased
drug resistance in human breast cancer specimens (29), colon
cancer cells (30), and human breast cancer cell lines (31).
Quercetin has been reported to inhibit Hsp70 expression by
blocking heat shock transcription factor (HSF) 1 and HSF2 and

MiaPaCa-2 cells starting at 24 h and in Panc-1 cells at 48 h after
transfection (Fig. 6A and B). The highest levels of caspase-3 activity
were observed in MiaPaCa-2 cells. Similar results were obtained
with an additional siRNA (siRNA #2) in MiaPaca-2 (Fig. 6E).
Caspase-9 also showed significant activation during the examined
time course (Fig. 6C and D). Application of control siRNA altered
neither caspase-3 nor caspase-9 activity compared with mocktransfected cells. Both Annexin V and caspase expression profiles
showed that Hsp70-specific oligonucleotides were able to initiate
apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro.
Inhibition of Hsp70 expression decreases in vivo tumor
growth in nude mice. Tumors developed in all animals injected s.c.
with MiaPaCa-2 cells. After daily injection of quercetin (50 mg/kg)
for 18 consecutive days, the tumor volume was significantly
reduced (Fig. 7) compared with controls (injected with DMSO
vehicle alone). Western blotting for Hsp70 revealed that these
tumors also had decreased Hsp70 following quercetin injection.
This confirms our in vitro observation that quercetin induces
pancreatic cancer cell apoptosis via decreasing Hsp70.

Discussion
This study has shown that pancreatic cancer cells overexpress
Hsp70 when compared with normal pancreatic ductal cells.

for increased expression of Hsp70 in cancer cells and thus causing
the cells to die.
To confirm that the quercetin effect on cell viability was
specifically due to inhibition of Hsp70 expression, we used the
inactive analogue dihydroquercetin, which does not inhibit Hsp70
(37). As a control, dihydroquercetin did not alter cell viability of any
tumor cell line. Therefore, the effect observed with quercetin can
be ascribed to the reduction in Hsp70. Measurements of lactate
dehydrogenase activity in cell culture medium after 12 and 24 h of
treatment with quercetin or dihydroquercetin did not reveal any
significant increase, indicating that necrosis was not the underlying
mechanism for decreasing cell viability with quercetin (data not
shown). In contrast, both caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities in
MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells were significantly increased following
incubation with quercetin, strongly suggesting that the apoptotic

reducing Hsp70 mRNA accumulation (32, 33). Quercetin has been
used to down-regulate Hsp70 synthesis in various carcinoma cell
lines (25, 34–36). In the present study, inhibition of Hsp70 with
quercetin significantly decreased pancreatic cancer cell viability
(BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2, and Panc-1) but did not affect that of normal
ductal cells, which do not have high levels of endogenous Hsp70. In
accordance with quercetin having no effect on cell viability of
normal pancreatic ductal cells, quercetin did not influence Hsp70
expression levels in these cells. This shows the complexity of this
pathway in normal versus tumor cells. The signaling pathways
responsible for up-regulation of Hsp70 in pancreatic tumor cells
are unclear. Our additional data show that quercetin does not
affect the basal levels of Hsp70 in normal pancreatic duct cells but
inhibits the increased levels expressed in cancer cells. This suggests
that quercetin is possibly interacting with the pathways responsible

cytochrome c, the cytoplasmic Apaf-1, and procaspase-9. Both
pathways converge to the activation of downstream effector
caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7 (7, 12, 39).
Hsps are highly conserved proteins that play a role in
fundamental cellular processes. Hsp70 is one of the main Hsps
consisting of both constitutively expressed and stress-inducible
members, and it is a molecular chaperone that protects the
organism from stress-induced cell injury. Secondly, it has been
reported to act on several steps of the apoptotic cascade. The
detailed mechanism of the antiapoptotic effect of Hsp70 is yet to be
determined. However, it seems to be cell type specific. In a study
done by Li et al. (40), overexpression of Hsp70 in U937 lymphoma
cells clearly prevented caspase-3 activation, poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase cleavage, and DNA laddering, although cytochrome c
release was not blocked. This suggested that Hsp70 may inhibit
apoptosis downstream of cytochrome c release and upstream of
caspase-3 activation. Another study by Jaattela et al. (13)
hypothesized that Hsp70 exerts its antiapoptotic function downstream of caspase-3-like proteases, but it inhibits cytosolic
phospholipase A2 activation and causes changes in nuclear
morphology that are considered to be late caspase-dependent
events. A functional target protein for Hsp70 has been suggested
with Apaf-1. After release of cytochrome c from mitochondria,
Apaf-1 forms an oligomeric complex with cytochrome c in an ATP/
dATP manner. This step is critical for autoproteolytic cleavage of
procaspase-9 and subsequent caspase cascade activation. Saleh
et al. (41) suggest that Hsp70 is able to bind to Apaf-1 on its
caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and competes with procaspase-9 for binding to this domain. After binding of Hsp70 to Apaf-1,
a possible conformational change of the complex results in
inhibition of Apaf-1 oligomerization. Following this, recruitment
of procaspase-9 and subsequently caspase processing is stopped.
On the other hand, Beere et al. (42) propose that, after binding of
Hsp70, Apaf-1 fails to do a conformational change that would
expose CARD for recruitment of procaspase-9. Still, both models
show that caspase-9 cannot get activated. The association of
cytochrome c and Apaf-1 is still allowed by Hsp70 (41, 42). In
addition to Hsp70 interfering with the apoptotic pathway
downstream of the mitochondria, several studies have shown that
it can also prevent permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial
membrane and thus affect the release of cytochrome c.
In this study, we have shown that depletion of Hsp70 in the
pancreatic tumor cell lines MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 caused
activation of caspase-9. These results are consistent with the
observations that Hsp70 can prevent caspase-9 recruitment by its
ability to interfere with Apaf-1 and to block apoptosome formation.
Those data also suggest that, in pancreatic tumor cells, Hsp70 can
block apoptosis via the intrinsic branch of the apoptotic cascade
because caspase-9 is part of the mitochondrial pathway. Secondly,
we showed that Hsp70 acts on its antiapoptotic function upstream
of caspase-3. Activity of caspase-9, which triggers the maturation of
procaspase-3, was enhanced after Hsp70 knockout done by either
quercetin or siRNA. Elevated caspase-3 levels were measured in
both MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1 cells. From our data, we conclude that,
in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, Hsp70 also plays a major role in
caspase-dependent apoptosis and that Hsp70 acts upstream of
caspase-3.
However, the connection between Hsp70 and the oncogenic
potential of tumor cells is likely to be more complex than described
above. Apoptosis also occurs by caspase-independent mechanisms
in which Hsp70 may interact (43, 44). Presumably, one of the

with s.c. MiaPaCa-2 tumors were given daily quercetin injections (50 mg/kg)
for 18 consecutive days. Tumor growth was significantly (n = 5 control animals
and n = 7 animals treated with quercetin) reduced compared with controls

pathway is responsible for quercetin-induced cell death. In support
of this observation, Annexin V labeling and TUNEL staining
(markers of apoptosis) were significantly increased following
inhibition of Hsp70 in the cancer cell lines. Our data concur with
a study by Pandol et al. (38) showing that quercetin increased
apoptosis and caspase-3 in MiaPaCa-2 cells.
To rule out any quercetin effect unrelated to Hsp70 inhibition,
we used RNA interference for a selective knockout of Hsp70 and
assessed apoptosis using the same methodologic approach. In
accordance with the above data for quercetin, we were able to
show that Hsp70 siRNA resulted in increased apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer cell lines, marked by caspase-3 and caspase-9
activation, as well as Annexin V staining. These results clearly
support the fact that inhibition of Hsp70 expression results in
apoptotic cell death in pancreatic cancer cells and that quercetininduced cell death is mediated via its effect on Hsp70. However,
because the extent of apoptosis is somewhat more with quercetin
compared with Hsp70 siRNA, it is possible that quercetin may
affect viability by other mechanisms in addition to inhibition
of Hsp70. But we believe that one of the major effects of quercetin
is mediated via inhibition of Hsp70 due to the following reasons:
(a) quercetin significantly decreased Hsp70 in all cell lines
tested, (b) quercetin induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells,
(c) quercetin inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model, and
(d) dihydroquercetin (inactive analogue of quercetin, which does
not inhibit Hsp70) had no effect on Hsp70 and did not induce cell
apoptosis.
Apoptosis can occur via two main pathways. The extrinsic
pathway is characterized by the activation of death receptors on
the cell surface belonging to the TNF/nerve growth factor receptor
superfamily and recruitment of the initiator caspases-8 and
caspase-10. The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway is independent
of death receptor signaling and involves the release of cytochrome
c from the mitochondria with the formation of a complex of

studies suggest that the bioflavonoid quercetin and other pharmaceuticals that inhibit Hsp70 are possible therapeutic agents in the
treatment of pancreatic cancer. Taken together, these results serve to
reinforce our belief that further in vivo and in vitro experiments need
to be done using quercetin and/or Hsp70 siRNA in combination with
chemotherapeutic drugs. Agents that can down-regulate Hsp70
expression may allow new strategies in cancer therapy and may
improve the dismal prognosis of pancreatic cancer.

targeted proteins is the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which is
also released from the mitochondria but triggers apoptosis
independently of caspases. To this end, Ravagnan et al. (44) have
shown that Hsp70 was able to antagonize the apoptogenic effects
of AIF both in a cell-free system and in intact cells.
We have also examined the effect of quercetin on pancreatic
cancer growth using a nude mouse model of pancreatic cancer
derived from the highly malignant pancreatic cancer cell line
MiaPaCa-2. Daily quercetin administration decreased pancreatic
tumor growth in vivo, confirming a previous report by Mouria et al.
(38). However, ours is the first study to show that this decrease in
tumor size was associated with decreased Hsp70 expression in
tumor tissue, thereby confirming that quercetin decreases
pancreatic tumor cell viability via lowering Hsp70.
In conclusion, we have identified a major role of Hsp70 in the
resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to apoptosis. Furthermore, our
