ABSTRACT
Background: While recent data show that crizotinib is highly effective in patients
with ROS1 rearrangement, few data is available about the prognostic impact, the
predictive value for different treatments, and the genetic heterogeneity of ROS1positive patients.
Patients and Methods: 1137 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung were
analyzed regarding their ROS1 status. In positive cases, next-generation sequencing
(NGS) was performed. Clinical characteristics, treatments and outcome of these
patients were assessed. Overall survival (OS) was compared with genetically defined
subgroups of ROS1-negative patients.

Results: 19 patients of 1035 evaluable (1.8%) had ROS1-rearrangement. The
median OS has not been reached. Stage IV patients with ROS1-rearrangement had
the best OS of all subgroups (36.7 months, p < 0.001). 9 of 14 (64.2%) patients had
at least one response to chemotherapy. Estimated mean OS for patients receiving
chemotherapy and crizotinib was 5.3 years. Ten patients with ROS1-rearrangement
(52.6%) harbored additional aberrations.
Conclusion: ROS1-rearangement is not only a predictive marker for response
to crizotinib, but also seems to be the one of the best prognostic molecular markers
in NSCLC reported so far. In stage IV patients, response to chemotherapy was
remarkable high and overall survival was significantly better compared to other
subgroups including EGFR-mutated and ALK-fusion-positive NSCLC.

analyze specific features of ROS1 rearrangement detection

co-occurring mutations measured by high-standard
techniques (next-generation sequencing [NGS]), and to

INTRODUCTION
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still the
leading cause of cancer-related death in the western world
[1]. Nevertheless, the identification of therapeutically
targetable oncogenic driver aberrations has led to an
improvement on the clinical outcome of genetically
defined subgroups of patients, like those harboring a
sensitizing mutation within the epidermal growth factor
receptor gene (EGFR) treated with EGFR-directed
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or with rearrangements
of the ALK oncogene treated with specific TKIs [2–6].
Additionally, improved molecular diagnostics led to a
genomics-based classifications of NSCLC [7].
Chromosomal rearrangements involving the ROS1
gene (c-ros oncogene 1) have recently been identified
and described in 1–2% of patients with lung cancer [8,
9]. ROS1 (chromosome 6q22) encodes a receptor tyrosine
kinase which belongs to the insulin receptor family, with
downstream signaling via the MAPK pathway through
phosphorylation of RAS [10]. In lung cancer, ROS1 fusion
partners include FIG, CD74, SLC34A2 and SDC4, which
lead to oncogenic transformation and constitutive kinase
activity in cell culture and/or in vivo [8, 11, 12]. So far, no
ligand for the ROS1 tyrosine kinase has been identified.
Preclinical data suggest that ROS1 can be targeted
by ALK inhibitors due to highly similar tyrosine kinase
domains [13]. These findings together with the clinical
notion that the cohort of ROS1-rearranged patients share
features with ALK-rearranged patients led to the discovery
that crizotinib is an effective treatment option with high
response rates [9]. Nevertheless, few is known about the
prognostic value, the clinical presentation, the predictive
value for different therapy regimens, and the genetic
heterogeneity in terms of multiplex-sequencing of patients
harboring ROS1 rearrangement.
We set out this study in order to genetically and
phenotypically identify patients with ROS1-rearranegments
as part of an international, oligocentric prospective phase
II trial to assess the response rates of patients with ROS1rearrangement treated with crizotinib (clinicaltrials.gov,
NCT02183870), within a molecular screening network.
The aim of this study was to detect the prevalence and

RESULTS
ROS1-rearrangement patterns
The majority of the samples were biopsy specimens
(i.e. core needle biopsies, ultrasound-guided transbronchial
biopsies and cytology specimens). Of all ROS1-rearranged
cases, only 1 sample was material from total tumor
resection lobectomy. None of the ROS1 rearranged cases
was a cytology specimen (i.e. blocked material from fine
needle aspiration).
ROS1 status was evaluable in 1035 out of 1137
(91.0%) patients, whereof 19 patients (1.8%) had a ROS1
rearrangement. ROS1 signals were homogeneously distri­
buted in all analyzed tumors. The amount of cells showing
aberrant signals ranged between 23% and 100% (mean
66%, median 67%). In all rearranged cases we observed an
even signal distribution over the entire tumor with no “hot
spot” areas. However, among different rearranged tumors,
we observed a certain variation in the signal patterns. Some
tumors showed only additional 3’ signals with no or few split
signals, indicating an unbalanced translocation. In contrast,
other tumors showed a homogenous split signal pattern in all
tumor cells (see Figure 1).

Clinical presentation
10 patients were male and 9 patients female.
A  summary of the clinical characterization is given in
Table 1. The median age at diagnosis was 60 years (range,
26–87). In one patient, there were partially neuroendocrine
patterns in the tumor. The majority of patients presented
with stage IV disease at diagnosis (n = 14). 13 patients

missense mutation (K57N). Of the P72R patients,
one had an EGFR mutation in exon 21 (P848L). All
TP53 alterations were either known polymorphisms or
inactivating and truncating mutations.
2 out of 17 patients analyzed with NGS or by Sanger
sequencing (11.8%) had BRAF mutations (G469S and
an intron mutation c.1742–1 G > T, p.? which has not
been described yet). One patient (6.7%) showed a MET
mutation (R988C), located within the juxtamembrane
region. Taken together, in 10 of 15 (66.7%) patients
analyzed by NGS, further genetic aberrations were
detected (see Table 2). Both BRAF mutations occurred in
patients with a smoking history.

(68.4%) were never-smokers, whereas 3 were active
smokers and 3 patients had a smoking history. Patients
with smoking history had a median of 40 pack-years
(range, 30–45). The clinical and pathological presentation
of each patient is listed in Table 2.

Co-occurring mutations detected by NGS
15 of the 19 (78.9%) detected patients could
further be analyzed by NGS. In 7 (46.7%), aberrations
within the TP53 gene were detected: 5 patients (33.3%)
had the P72R-polymorphism, whereof one patient
had also a E204* mutation, and one patient had a
K305* as the only additional aberration. One patient

Treatment outcomes

In all four patients without NGS analysis the ALK
status analysis was performed using FISH. None of them
harbored a translocation. RET status was negative in the
two patients analyzed. Sanger sequencing did not reveal
any other genetic aberrations.

Of the 14 stage IV patients, 12 were evaluable
for outcome analysis (one had an individual treatment
approach with combining systemic therapy with local
procedures, one was lost to follow-up after irradiation of
cerebral metastasis). Two stage IIIB patients were taken
into analysis. The 14 patients received between one and 8
chemotherapy lines respectively (median = 1, see Table 2).
Of them, 9 patients (64.3%) had at least one radiological
response to chemotherapy, 3 (21.4%) had stable disease
as best outcome and 2 (14.3%) did not respond to
chemotherapy (see Supplementary Figure 3A). Table 2
shows the different outcomes of the patients. Both patients
not responding to treatment had additional truncating TP53
mutations, possibly indicating that p53 inactivation might
be a surrogate marker for chemoresistance of ROS1-positive
tumors. Due to the small number of patients without benefit
from chemotherapy, we did not check for a correlation
of the percentage of translocated tumor cells and clinical
outcome.
Supplementary Table 1 lists the used regimen and
their outcomes. Noteworthy, while platinum/pemetrexed
combinations showed high response rates with four
out of five times used, the commonly used first-line
therapy of platinum/paclitaxel only led to one response
in six applications (see Supplementary Figure 3B and
Supplementary Table 1). In all cases, treatment with
erlotinib led to primary progression (n = 3). In three cases,
progression developed under bevacizumab maintenance
therapy after initial response (data not shown).
Five patients received crizotinib treatment; all of them
responded impressively to monotherapy (see Figure 2C).
So far only one patient died under therapy, whereas the
remaining four are still ongoing under therapy.

Survival analysis
Median follow-up time (see supplementary data)
was 16.6 months (95% CI, 9.3–23.9 months). For patients
with ROS1-rearrangement, the median OS was not
reached (see Figure 2A). The estimated mean survival
time was 51.1 months (95% CI, 32.1–70.0 months).
Patients with stage IV (n = 14) were further
compared with 115 stage IV patients comprising 38
patients with EGFR mutation treated with erlotinib and/or
gefitinib and/or afatinib (+/− cetuximab), 13 patients with
ALK rearrangement treated with crizotinib and/or ceritinib,
32 patients with KRAS mutations and 32 patients with
squamous-cell carcinoma and FGFR1 amplification (see
Supplementary Figure 1). Survival for the ROS1-positive
patients was significantly better than in the comparison
group (36.7 months vs 17.5 months, p = 0.005). Median
overall survival for the ROS1-patients who did not receive
crizotinib treatment (n = 9) was 36.7 months, whereas
the median for the five patients receiving crizotinib has
not been reached (estimated mean OS, 65.9 months [95%
CI, 44.3 – 87.5 months], see Supplementary Figure 2).
Due to the small sample-size and the low prevalence of
events, no statistical significance between ROS1 stage IV
patients with or without crizotinib treatment (p = 0.279,
see supplement) could be found.
Compared with genetically predefined subgroups,
patients with ROS1-rearrangement had the best OS (p ≤
0.001, see Figure 2B and Table 3). OS was significantly
prolonged compared to EGFR-mutated patients (36.7 vs.
25.3 months, p = 0.047) and to ALK-rearranged patients
(36.7 vs. 23.9 months, p = 0.026), both treated with targetspecific therapy. Taken both, EGFR-positive and ALKpositive patients together, their OS was 24.2 months (95%
CI, 20.9–27.5 months) and remained significantly shorter
than for ROS1-rearranged patients (p = 0.033).

when compared to targeted-treated EGFR-mutated and/
or ALK-rearranged patients. Further, this analysis suggests
a potential benefit of chemotherapy for this subgroup of
NSCLC patients regarding OS and response and stays in line
with recent reports of the high efficacy of crizotinib treatment
for these patients [9, 14–17]. Taken together, due to high
response rates under both “classic” cytotoxic therapy and
targeted therapy with crizotinib for stage IV patients ROS1rearrangement seems to repesent one of the best prognostic
factors in NSCLC reported so far. Estimated mean survival
times for all patients are in the range of years, and until
today, no median OS has been reached, neither for the entire
population nor for the stage IV patients receiving crizotinib.
Due to its exploratory character, this analysis suffers
some limitations: The number of patients described is small,
and no power calculation has been performed a priori. By
nature, all the analyses presented here were retrospective,
and pooling the treatment regimens and the resulting
response rates is not comparable to outcomes in prospective
clinical trials. Nevertheless, given the low frequency of 1.8%
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in 1035 screened patients and the very recent discovery of
this aberration, such retrospective analyses are needed to
gain more insights in the clinical course of these patients.
Clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of crizotinb treatment
prospectivly for patients with ROS1-rearrangement are
ongoing, and these data will be available in the near future.
Importantly and in some contrast to published
literature [9], our data show that ROS1-rearrangements
are not mutually exclusive with other transformationassociated genetic aberrations, as the majority of the
patients presented with additional mutations. Beside
mutations in BRAF, MET, and MAP2K1, we found
a large variety of mutations affecting TP53. In two
cases, truncating mutations of TP53 co-occurred with
progressive disease under chemotherapy, whereof one
patient, a 26-year old female patient, also presented with a
partial neuroendocrine histology. Analysis of larger series
of ROS1 positive patients in the future will elucidate
whether these additional aberrations might play a role in
the development of resistance.

In ALK-rearaanged patients, pemetrexed is an
efficient treatment choice [18]. While the efficacy
of crizotinib in ROS1-rearranged patients has been
recently shown [16], our dataset also suggests a benefit
for pemetrexed-containing regimens in these patients.
Therefore, drug development comprises both genetic
subgroups [19]. Surprisingly, paclitaxel-containing
platinum therapy seems to underperform in this patient
group. Although the interpretation of this observation
clearly is limited by the low patient number, it will be
interesting to see if the choice of the primary platinumbased chemotherapy regimen has an impact on outcome.
Taken together, ROS1-rearranged patients represent
a unique subgroup of NSCLC patients, with a relatively
good prognosis, a remarkable good outcome under different
regimens of chemotherapy and dramatic responses under
crizotinib. Future analysis will reveal more insights
regarding the role of additional genetic aberrations in
acquired resistance and differences in the efficacy of distinct
chemotherapeutic regimens.

with at least one therapy-line with TKIs (i. e., erlotinib,
gefitinib, afatinib, AZD9291 for EGFR, crizotinib and/or
ceritinib for EML4-ALK), representing the subgroups of
NSCLC patients so far with the best overall survival (OS)
in stage IV NSCLC [7]. We also analyzed patients with
KRAS mutations to provide a group without any targeted
therapy option, and FGFR1-amplified squamous-cell
carcinoma patients as a comparator smoking associated
lung cancer [21].

Samples and immunohistochemistry

METHODS

Tumor tissue was fixed in buffered formalin and
embedded in paraffin blocks. All primary diagnoses
were reviewed by two experienced pathologists.
Morphologic features, e.g. size of nuclei, nucleus/
cytoplasm ratio and chromatin structure were evaluated
on haematoxylin-eosin slides. To confirm the diagnosis
ancillary immunohistochemical stainings were made, e.g.
cytokeratins (CK5/6, CK7, p40) as well as TTF1 (thyroid
transcription factor 1). Tumor diagnoses were made in
accordance to the current WHO classification system [22].

Patients

FISH assay

This study was performed within a collaborative
health care provider network for comprehensive
molecular diagnostics of lung cancer in Cologne, Germany
(Network Genomic Medicine [NGM], based at the Center
for Integrated Oncology Köln-Bonn [CIO], Cologne,
Germany), where samples of 1024 patients were analyzed,
and in Barcelona, Spain, where 113 samples were screened
for ROS1-status. The screening process was performed
in order to detect patients who might participate in the
aforementioned clinical trial. The trial has been approved
by local auhorities and the responsible ethics committees.
Screening procedures were conducted in concordance
with the local ethical guidelines and were reviewed by the
institutional ethics committee. All patients consented to
be contacted after diagnosis and to provide information
about the clinical history and outcome. Insight into their
medical records was obtained. The present study covers
a timeframe from August 2012 to April 2014. There was
no preselection of patients regarding stage or clinical
presentation.
Within the same timeframe, we collected data from
patients without ROS1-rearrangement, who provided
written informed consent to have their data analyzed, but
with other defined aberrations. As ROS1-rearrangement
most probably occurs in patients without smoking
history [9], and given the fact that NSCLC in neversmokers differs heavily from those of smokers in terms of
mutational variability [20], we chose ALK-rearranged and
EGFR-mutated patients with similar smoking habits as the
best fitting control group. For both groups, patients were
only taken into analysis if they had received treatment

For FISH, three to four μm tissue sections were
mounted on sialinized slides and hybridized overnight
with the ZytoLight© SPEC ROS1 Dual Color Break Apart
Probe (ZytoVision, Bremerhaven, Germany). The 3` ROS1
probe was labeled with ZyGreen™ and the 5` ROS1 probe
was labeled with ZyOrange™. An exact protocol about the
procedures is given in the supplementary file.
Tumors were defined as ROS1 rearranged when
having ≥ 20% of tumor cells harboring aberrant signals.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS)
A more detailed protocol of tissue preparation for
NGS is added as a supplementary file. Targeted next
generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on all FFPE
samples. Isolated DNA (< 0.5 – 200 ng/μl) was amplified
with an in-house specified, customized Ion AmpliSeq
Primer Pool (Lifetechnologies, Carlsbad, USA). The
panel comprises 102 amplicons of 14 different genes.
PCR products were ligated to adapters and enriched
for target regions using the Ion AmpliSeq PanelTM
Library kit according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Lifetechnologies). The generated libraries were pooled
equimolarly for amplicon sequencing to a concentration
of 3 nM of each sample to counterbalance differences in
sample quality. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina
MiSeq benchtop sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, USA).
Results were visualized in the Integrative Genomics
Viewer (IGV) and then manually analyzed. A 5% cutoff
for variant calls was used and results were only interpreted
if the coverage was > 200.

mutations. J Clin Oncol. 2013; 31:3327–3334.

Age, gender, and tumor stage at diagnosis
according to the UICC classification were assessed.
Smoking status, medical history regarding past cancer
therapies, and outcome to treatments were analyzed.
For smoking status, pack-years were annotated. The
following qualitative attribution was assessed: Patients
with less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime were
considered as never smokers, patients with more than
100 cigarettes, who quit smoking at least one year before
first diagnosis of lung cancer were considered former
smokers, and patients with a smoking history of more
than one pack-year who continued smoking for a period
shorter than one year before diagnosis were considered
current smokers.

Statistics
Qualitative variables were summarized by count
and percentage, quantitative variables (i.e. age) by mean,
standard deviation, median and range. Distribution
of time to event was described by the Kaplan-Meier
curve and compared between groups by the log-rank
test, giving the 95% confidence interval (95% CI).
Association of qualitative variables was tested for by chisquare or Fisher’s exact test, contingent on distributional
assumptions. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the
time period from the date of first diagnosis until death.
Patients who were still alive at the data cut-off were
censored.
