BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endothelial growth factor and is approved for the treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Previous authors have reported differential response to bevacizumab on an individual basis. Bevacizumab-induced hypertension is a well-documented side effect, and some reports have suggested this occurrence
to be related to treatment outcome in other cancers. In the current study, the authors analyzed patients with recurrent GBM who
were treated with bevacizumab based on whether the patients developed drug-induced hypertension. METHODS: All patients with
GBM treated within the Emory Healthcare system from 2007 through 2012 were reviewed. A total of 82 patients were identified who
received bevacizumab for the treatment of recurrent GBM and were included in the current study. Patients were classified as normotensive or hypertensive depending on whether hypertension developed that was attributable to therapy. Progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) were graphed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed
using the Cox proportional hazards method. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 19.7 months. Of the 82 patients with recurrent GBM
who were treated with bevacizumab, 30 developed drug-induced hypertension. The median time to the development of hypertension
was 21 days. The median PFS for the normotensive and hypertensive groups were 2.5 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI],
1.6-3.0 months) and 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.6-10.0 months), respectively (P<.001). The median OS times for the normotensive and hypertensive groups were 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.4-6.8 months) and 11.7 months (95% CI, 9.0-20.5 months), respectively (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with recurrent GBM who developed bevacizumab-induced hypertension demonstrated significantly better
PFS and OS compared with normotensive individuals. Bevacizumab-induced hypertension may be a physiologic marker of outcome

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a malignant primary brain tumor that presents mainly in adults and carries a poor prognosis, with
a median survival of slightly >1 year after surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ).1 Similarly, patients with recurrent disease have been described to have median survivals in the range of
3 to 9 months with a variety of salvage therapies administered.2,3 Given these poor outcomes, improved treatment strategies are clearly needed.
Bevacizumab is a recombinant human monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody that selectively binds to and neutralizes the human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).4 Because GBM is known to be highly vascular and express
high levels of VEGF, selective neutralization of this pathway can potentially reduce tumor vascularization and growth.3,5
In 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration approved bevacizumab as a single-agent therapy for previously treated
patients with GBM after two phase 2 studies demonstrated patient benefit, with median response durations of 3.9 to 4.2
months.4,6,7
Similar to other conventional antitumor agents, bevacizumab has efficacy and toxicity that vary from patient to
patient. Prior authors have attempted to identify biomarkers for the prediction of drug efficacy, including histologic factors such microvessel density and genetic factors such as perturbations in p53 or mutations in Ras, without significant success.8,9 Schneider et al demonstrated that select VEGF genotypes are associated with overall survival (OS) benefits in

patients with metastatic breast cancer and that these genotypes are associated with bevacizumab-induced hypertension, a well-documented side effect of this therapy.9
Accordingly, several other published series have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in metastatic breast,10
colorectal,11-14 non-small cell lung,12 ovarian,12 and renal
cell carcinoma15 for those patients who develop hypertension secondary to bevacizumab treatment. However, to
the best of our knowledge, there has been no reported series to date investigating differential drug effects for
patients who develop hypertension secondary to receiving
bevacizumab for the treatment of recurrent GBM.
The objective of the current study was to determine
whether patients who developed hypertension as a side
effect of bevacizumab therapy for recurrent GBM demonstrate differential response to this targeted therapy agent.
Herein, we describe a single-institution, retrospective,
clinical outcomes analysis of patients treated with bevacizumab for recurrent GBM and the development of druginduced hypertension.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

All patients treated in the Emory Healthcare system from
2007 to 2012 with a histologic diagnosis of GBM were analyzed with Institutional Review Board approval. Only
those patients who were initially treated with the standard
of care (surgical resection, radiotherapy, and TMZ) who
developed recurrent disease (radiographical evidence of disease recurrence/progression) and were subsequently treated
with bevacizumab were included in the current study. The
patient’s surgery was categorized a macroscopic total resection, subtotal resection, or biopsy. The radiation dose
administered for the initial treatment of GBM was 60 gray
over 6 weeks. O-6 methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) status was determined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay16 as a send-out test (performed
by The Center for Advanced Molecular Diagnostics in the
Department of Pathology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts).
Chemotherapy

Patients in the current study were treated with either
single-agent bevacizumab, bevacizumab with irinotecan,
or bevacizumab with TMZ. Bevacizumab was administered at a dose of either 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of actual
body weight intravenously once every 14 days, based on
the recommendation of the patient’s neurooncologist. Irinotecan, when used, was given at a dose of 125 mg/m2
intravenously every 2 weeks. For patients treated with
Cancer

combined bevacizumab and TMZ, additional TMZ was
given at a dose of 150 mg/m2 to 200 mg/m2 on days 1 to
5 of a 28-day cycle (standard adjuvant TMZ regimen1) or
daily metronomic administrations of 50 mg/m2.
Study Design

Patients were categorized into “normotensive” or
“hypertensive” groups. The criteria for the hypertensive
group included initiation of an antihypertensive medication by their neurooncologist or primary care physician
after the start of treatment with bevacizumab, an increase
in a preexisting antihypertensive medication or the addition of a new antihypertensive agent while receiving therapy, or at least 2 consecutive documented blood pressure
measurements of systolic >140 mm Hg or diastolic
>90 mm Hg after the initiation of therapy in patients
with no prior record of hypertension. Patients who had a
documented history of hypertension who did not require
an increase in antihypertensive agents were not included
in the “hypertensive” group. Patients with hypertension
that was assessed as being secondary to corticosteroid use
were not included in the hypertensive group. Blood pressure was measured at every clinic visit. Drug-induced
hypertension was graded based on the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 4).17
Statistical Analysis

Disease progression was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging was contraindicated for 1 patient, and a computed tomography scan
was used for this individual. The progression-free survival
(PFS) was calculated from the initiation of bevacizumab
therapy to the time of disease progression or death, whichever came earlier. OS was calculated from the time of the
initiation of bevacizumab therapy to the date of death due
to any cause. Patients who did not demonstrate disease
progression or who were still alive at the time of last
follow-up were censored. PFS and OS curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical analysis
was conducted using SAS statistical software (version 9.3;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and only P values <.05 were
considered to be statistically significant.
Univariate analysis of the hypertensive group was
performed using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test for
categorical covariates when appropriate, and analysis of
variance for numerical covariates. For each covariate, the
univariate and multivariable associations with OS and
PFS were conducted using the Cox proportional hazards
model. The variables shown in the univariate analysis with

a P value <.2 were entered in the multivariable model. The
conditional landmark analysis method was used to account
for possible guarantee-time bias.18 The purpose of the landmark analysis was to adjust for possible bias from falsely
categorizing patients in the normotensive group if they had
died or stopped taking bevacizumab before experiencing
the hypertensive side effect. In addition, this analysis also
adjusted for the possibility of including patients who developed spurious hypertension long after bevacizumab exposure, which is not truly representative of drug-induced
hypertension. The landmark time was determined to be the
95th percentile time for the development of hypertension.
Accordingly, patients who died or stopped taking bevacizumab before the landmark time were excluded from analysis
in the guarantee-time bias adjustment, and patients who
did not develop hypertension by the landmark time were
not included in the hypertensive group. The start time
point for this analysis was reset at the landmark date, which
was found to be 2.5 months.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

A total of 82 patients were treated in the Emory Healthcare system between 2007 and 2012. The median followup was 19.7 months. The median age of all patients was
57 years. There were 52 patients (63%) in the normotensive group and 30 patients (37%) in the hypertensive
group. The median time to the development of druginduced hypertension was 21 days. Of the 30 patients
who developed hypertension, 17 (57%) were classified as
having Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
1458

Events grade 2 hypertension, and 13 (43%) were classified
with grade 3. No significant differences with regard to
age, sex, Karnofsky performance status, MGMT status,
type of surgery performed, time to initial disease recurrence, or number of disease recurrences were found
between the normotensive and hypertensive groups (Table 1). The majority of patients (55%) underwent initial
subtotal surgical resections of their tumors, followed by
30% of patients who underwent macroscopic total resections and 15% who underwent tumor biopsies. The median time between initial surgery and treatment with
bevacizumab was 7.1 months. In addition, the majority of
patients (88%) were treated with bevacizumab for their
first disease recurrence, whereas 12% were treated for their
second recurrence. Three patients received bevacizumab
at a dose of 5 mg/kg, and the remaining patients (n 5 79)
received a dose of 10 mg/kg.
Relationship Between Hypertension and
Clinical Outcomes

The median PFS for all patients was 3.3 months. The PFS
was found to be significantly different between the 2
groups, with a median time of 2.5 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.6-3.0 months) for the normotensive patients and 6.7 months (95% CI, 4.6-10.0
months) for the hypertensive patients (P<.001) (Fig. 1).
The median OS for all patients was 7.1 months. Again,
OS was significantly longer in the hypertensive group,
with a median OS of 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.4-6.8
months) reported in the normotensive patients and a median OS of 11.7 months (95% CI, 9.0-20.5 months)

noted in the hypertensive patients (P<.001) (Fig. 2). No
significant difference was found with regard to the type of
systemic therapy regimen received (P 5 .31) or MGMT
methylation status (P 5 .09) among the 2 groups (Table
1). The hypertensive group did receive significantly more
doses of bevacizumab compared with the normotensive
group (median of 15 doses [95% CI, 13.3-22.2 doses] vs
6 doses [95% CI, 5.2-8.5 doses], respectively [P<.01]),
most likely due to better responses to therapy among the
hypertensive patients.

landmark time of 2.5 months (Fig. 4). The adjusted hazards ratio for PFS and OS for the group with druginduced hypertension was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.13–0.41) and
0.25 (95% CI, 0.15-0.44), respectively (Fig. 3).

Univariate and Multivariate Analysis

Univariate analysis with PFS and OS as endpoints for
potential prognostic factors is summarized in Table 2.
Multivariate progression and survival analysis was conducted for those variables with P values <.2 on univariate
analysis, and hazards ratios are shown in Figure 3. For
both PFS and OS, the drug-induced hypertension status
was found to be significant on both univariate and multivariate analysis. In addition, as expected, methylated
MGMT status also was found to be independently predictive of improved OS on both univariate and multivariate
analysis.
Conditional Landmark Analysis

The conditional landmark analysis method was used to
account for possible guarantee-time bias.18 The landmark
time was chosen to be 2.5 months (95th percentile of time
to development of hypertension). After adjusting for possible guarantee-time bias, the median OS times for the
normotensive and hypertensive groups were found to be
3.6 months (95% CI, 2.3-4.7 months) and 9.2 months
(95% CI, 6-22.3 months), respectively (P<.001) past the

DISCUSSION
GBM is the most common primary malignant brain tumor diagnosed in adults. Despite improvements in treatment strategies, the OS of these patients is still quite poor,
with very few individuals surviving >5 years.1 Consequently, novel therapeutic strategies are still needed to
combat this disease. Given that angiogenesis is a prominent feature of GBM, approaches aimed at reducing vascular proliferation appear to be a promising strategy. The
majority of the angiogenesis noted in these tumors has
been attributed to expression of VEGF-A.19,20 Indeed,
treatment with bevacizumab among patients with recurrent GBM demonstrated clinical promise, with a significant percentage of objective radiographic responses noted,
prompting the US Food and Drug Administration to
accelerate approval in 2009.6,7 Recently, two phase 3 clinical trials demonstrated that the addition of bevacizumab
to standard radiotherapy with TMZ chemotherapy for
patients with newly diagnosed GBM resulted in improved
PFS but not OS.21,22 Therefore, bevacizumab is currently
not commonly used in the initial treatment of patients
with GBM.
Regarding the use of bevacizumab in patients with
recurrent GBM, the results of the current study clearly
demonstrate a differential response, not only with disease
control but also with OS, to bevacizumab on an individual basis based on whether hypertension developed as a

the possibility that patients died before displaying the

knowledge that accounts for such a bias in patients dis1460

playing differential survival based on drug-induced hypertension from bevacizumab for all tumors. The current
study data also demonstrate that the differences in tumor
control and survival were not attributable to differences in
age, Karnofsky performance status, MGMT methylation
status, or type of surgery between the 2 groups. These data

verify that methylated MGMT status independently confers an OS benefit for all patients treated with TMZ.23
Although a recent randomized study suggested a differential response to bevacizumab therapy for patients with
recurrent glioblastoma based on MGMT methylation,24
the percentage of patients with methylated MGMT promoters in the current series was essentially the same in the
normotensive and hypertensive groups. Thus, we believe
that the differential response to bevacizumab treatment
observed in the current study cannot be attributed to
MGMT methylation status.
Other researchers have reported differences in clinical outcomes in other malignancies, including metastatic
breast cancer,10 metastatic colorectal cancer,11-14 nonsmall cell lung cancer,12 and ovarian cancer,12 depending
on whether patients develop hypertension as a drug side
effect. Although hypertension is a well-documented side
effect of bevacizumab, to our knowledge the underlying
physiology for this effect is not completely understood. It
is hypothesized to be secondary to inhibition of the
VEGF signaling pathway, which normally leads to a
reduction in systemic vascular resistance from the
increased production of nitric oxide via activation of
VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) in endothelial cells25 and
prostacyclin (also called prostaglandin I2 or PGI2) via
activation of heterodimers of VEGFR receptor-1
(VEGFR-1) and VEGFR-2.13
Although the data from the current study clearly
demonstrates a clinical benefit for patients who develop
hypertension during therapy, we speculate as to whether
these findings could be used to change the clinical management of patients with recurrent GBM. Although the
majority of patients who develop hypertension while
receiving bevacizumab will be monitored and managed
pharmacologically, severe cases that may have previously
prompted discontinuation of treatment may now warrant
more aggressive attempts to control blood pressure than
before. Mir et al reported the incidence of hypertension
secondary to bevacizumab in patients with metastatic
colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and ovarian
cancer and found that patients who developed hypertension received significantly higher doses of drug (median
dose, 50 mg/kg vs 30 mg/kg; P 5 .001).12 Therefore, bevacizumab dosing may be titratable to blood pressure
response. We speculate that this strategy may be used to
find the “ideal” dose (within certain limits) of bevacizumab for individual patients to increase responses and
improve overall outcomes. Alternatively, patients who do
not develop hypertension from bevacizumab may be considered for intensification of therapy with the addition of

another agent. However, these approaches must be validated in clinical trials before they are implemented.
It is possible that development of hypertension is a
phenotypic marker of particular genotypes that are associated with better responses to bevacizumab. In this setting,
titrating bevacizumab dosing may not be as effective
because patients who are more resistant to drug-induced
hypertension may have tumor genotypes that are naturally
more resistant to this agent despite adequate drug levels.
Certain genotypes have been associated with both tumor
response and the development of hypertension from bevacizumab. Lambrechts et al evaluated patients on 2
randomized phase 3 trials for metastatic pancreatic and renal cell cancers and found that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the VEGFR-1 locus was associated
with increased VEGFR-1 expression and worse patient
outcomes.26 These authors also demonstrated that 6 different SNPs at loci involving the VEGF-A pathway,
including VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, EPAS1, and
EGLN3, were associated with the development of
bevacizumab-induced hypertension.27 Schneider et al
have evaluated SNPs at the VEGF-A locus in patients
with metastatic breast cancer and their association with
outcome and the development of hypertension.9 Specifically, they found that 2 VEGF promoter SNP alleles,
VEGF-2578AA and VEGF-1154A, were associated with
better OS whereas 2 additional VEGF promoter SNP alleles, VEGF-634CC and VEGF-1498TT, were protective
against hypertension. It is interesting to note that the advantageous haplotype alleles, VEGF-2578A and VEGF1154A, were not found to be associated with SNP alleles
that were protective against hypertension (VEGF-634C
and VEGF-1498T). If these specific SNPs at VEGF-A
and other loci are also found to be predictive of outcome
and the development of hypertension in the patient
cohort in the current study, then a genetic test may be
used alternatively to predict the responsiveness of recurrent GBM to bevacizumab. Although beyond the scope of
the current study, it may be worthwhile to evaluate
whether these VEGF promoter SNPs are prognostically
significant in patients with recurrent GBM.
The results of the current study demonstrate a profound improvement in tumor control and OS in patients
who develop bevacizumab-induced hypertension: a >6month improvement in OS, independent of MGMT
methylation status. Although the current study is a report
of a single-institution, retrospective study with all the limitations associated with such an approach, to the best of
our knowledge it is the only series in the literature that has
examined and reports a differential survival for patients
