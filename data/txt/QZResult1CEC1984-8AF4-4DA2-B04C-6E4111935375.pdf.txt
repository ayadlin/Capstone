ABSTRACT
Resistance to chemotherapy and a high relapse rate highlight the importance of
finding new therapeutic options for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACIs) are a promising class of drugs
for the treatment of AML. HDACIs have limited single-agent clinical activities, but
when combined with conventional or investigational drugs they have demonstrated
favorable outcomes. Previous studies have shown that decreasing expression of
important DNA damage repair proteins enhances standard chemotherapy drugs.
In our recent studies, the pan-HDACI panobinostat has been shown to enhance
conventional chemotherapy drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin in AML cells by
decreasing the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51. In this study, we utilized
class- and isoform-specific HDACIs and shRNA knockdown of individual HDACs to
determine which HDACs are responsible for decreased expression of BRCA1, CHK1,
and RAD51 following pan-HDACI treatment in AML cells. We found that inhibition of
both HDAC1 and HDAC2 was necessary to decrease the expression of BRCA1, CHK1,
and RAD51, enhance cytarabine- or daunorubicin-induced DNA damage and apoptosis,
and abrogate cytarabine- or daunorubicin-induced cell cycle checkpoint activation
in AML cells. These findings may aid in the development of rationally designed drug
combinations for the treatment of AML.

INTRODUCTION

urgently needed to improve treatment outcome of AML
patients.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACIs)
are a class of antileukemic agents of particular promise
due to their effects on cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest,
and apoptosis in human leukemic cells, but less so in
normal cells [1, 4, 5]. However, the pleiotropic spectrum
of pan-HDACIs makes it difficult to investigate the
specific function of individual HDACs which contribute
to the antileukemic effect. Although HDACIs have
limited single-agent clinical activities [6–10], they have

The standard treatment for most acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) patients, consisting of cytarabine
(ara-C) and an anthracycline [e.g., daunorubicin (DNR)],
has been used for the past four decades. Though a high
percentage of patients respond to induction therapy, a
majority relapse [1]. AML is typically diagnosed in elderly
individuals (median age 60–65 years); this population
has higher rates of therapy-related relapse and decreased
efficacy [2, 3]. Therefore, more effective therapies are

demonstrated promising results when combined with
conventional and investigational drugs for the treatment
of AML [11–13]. We previously demonstrated that
panobinostat (a pan-HDACI) suppressed the expression
of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 which play critical roles
in the DNA damage response (DDR), leading to induction
of DNA DSBs and apoptosis, and abrogation of the
activation of the cell cycle checkpoints induced by ara-C
or DNR in AML cells [14]. However, it is still unknown
which HDAC isoforms play a key role in regulating the
expression of these proteins.
In this study, we demonstrate that together HDAC1
and HDAC2 activities are responsible for the decreased
expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 following
class I- or pan-HDACI treatment in AML cells. By
treating THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cell lines with class-,
subclass-, and isoform-selective HDACIs, we found that
simultaneous inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 caused
decreased expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51.
Inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 enhanced DNA DSBs
and apoptosis induced by ara-C or DNR. Furthermore,
it abrogated the activation of the S and G2 cell cycle
checkpoints induced by ara-C or DNR in AML cell lines.
These findings provide a better therapeutic strategy for the
development of new HDACIs for the treatment of AML.

these results demonstrate that Class II HDACs do not
disrupt BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 expression in AML
cells.

Inhibiting HDACs 1, 2, and 3 decreases the
transcript and protein levels of BRCA1, CHK1,
and RAD51 and induces apoptosis in AML cell
lines
To determine if Class I HDACs affect the transcript
and protein levels of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 genes,
we treated THP-1 cells with variable concentrations
of MGCD0103 (a class I HDACI) for 48 h and then
measured the enzymatic activities of HDACs 1, 2, 3, and
8 following immunoprecipitation. MGCD0103 caused
significant inhibition of HDACs 1, 2, and 3 activities,
but did not affect HDAC8 activity (Figure 2A). Then we
measured BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 transcript levels by
real-time RT-PCR and protein levels by Western blotting
in the cell lines post MGCD0103 treatment. There was
a concentration-dependent decrease of BRCA1, CHK1,
and RAD51 transcript and protein levels in THP-1
cells (Figure 2B and 2C). Meanwhile, MGCD0103
caused concentration-dependent increase of acetylatedhistone H4, while having no effect on acetylation of
alpha-tubulin and total histone H4 levels (Figure 2C).
Similar results were also obtained in OCI-AML3 cells
(Figure 2D–2F). Interestingly, downregulation of these
DDR genes by MGCD0103 treatment was accompanied
by concentration-dependent induction of apoptosis
in both cell lines (Figure 2F). Together, these results
demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of HDACs 1, 2,
and 3 by MGCD0103 suppresses the transcript and protein
expression levels of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 in AML
cell lines.

RESULTS
Class II HDACs are irrelevant with respect to
the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 in
AML cells
In our previous study, we demonstrated that
the most potent pan-HDACI panobinostat induced
apoptosis by suppressing the expression of DNA
repair proteins BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 in AML
cells [14]. Further, we found that inhibition of both
HDACs 1 and 6 was critical for enhancing ara-C-induced
apoptosis in pediatric AML cells [15]. To investigate
which specific HDAC isoforms play critical roles in
this process in AML cells, first we focused on Class
II HDACs. We treated THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cell
lines with variable concentrations of MC1568 (a Class
IIa-selective HDACI) for 48 h and then subjected
whole cell lysates to Western blotting. As shown in
Figure 1A and 1B, MC1568 treatment resulted in
increased expression of ac-H4, but had no obvious
impact on the expression of ac-tubulin. Interestingly,
the expression levels of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51
in the AML cell lines remained largely unchanged,
demonstrating that class IIa HDACs are not involved in
the expression of these DDR genes (Figure 1A and 1B).
Similar results were obtained when THP-1 and
OCI-AML3 cells were treated with variable
concentrations of Tubastatin A (a HDAC6-selective
inhibitor) for 48 h (Figure 1C and 1D). Taken together,

Inhibiting HDACs 1, 2, and 3 enhances the
antileukemic activities of ara-C and DNR against
AML cells
To determine if inhibiting HDAC1, HDAC2, and
HDAC3 enhances the antileukemic activity of ara-C
or DNR, we treated THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cells with
MGCD0103 and ara-C or DNR, alone or combined, for
48 h and then subjected the cells to Annexin V/propidium
iodide (PI) staining, and flow cytometry. Consistent
with panobinostat, MGCD0103 enhanced ara-C- and
DNR-induced apoptosis in THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cells
(Figure 3A and 3C), which was accompanied by increased
DNA DSBs, as reflected by the induction of γH2AX (an
established biomarker for DNA double-strand breaks [16],
Figure 3B and 3D). In the combined treatment, we
detected decreased expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and
RAD51 compared to ara-C or DNR alone in both cell
lines (Figure 3B and 3D). MGCD0103 treatment alone
resulted in increased G0/G1 phase cells, suggesting

G0/G1 arrest and ara-C treatment resulted in increased
S and G2/M phase cells, suggesting S and G2/M arrest
in both cell lines. In THP-1 cells, ara-C-induced increase
of S phase cells was reduced, while in OCI-AML3 cells
ara-C-induced increase of G2/M phase cells was decreased
by the addition of MGCD0103 (Figure 3E and 3F). DNR
treatment resulted in increased G2/M phase cells, which
was reduced by co-administration of MGCD0103 in both
cell lines (Figure 3E and 3F). These results suggest that
inhibition of HDACs 1, 2, and 3 enhances the antileukemic
activity of ara-C and DNR through suppressing the
expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 in AML cells.

THP-1 AML cells. Next we treated THP-1/HDAC1 cells
and THP-1/HDAC2 cells with variable concentrations of
RGFP966, an HDAC3-selective inhibitor, for 48 h, and
then subjected the cells to Western blotting. As shown in
Figure 4D and 4E, RGFP966 treatment had no impact on
the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 compared
to no drug treated control or the no drug treated NTC
cells. These results suggest that simultaneous inhibition
of HDAC1 and HDAC3 or HDAC2 and HDAC3 is
not sufficient to reduce BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51
expression. Then we treated THP-1 and OCI-AML3
cells with variable concentrations of FK228 (an HDAC1
and HDAC2 inhibitor) for 48 h. Suppression of BRCA1,
CHK1, and RAD51 transcript and protein expression
was detected after cells were treated with 5 nM FK228,
which was accompanied by apoptosis (Figure 5). These
results revealed that HDAC1 and HDAC2 cooperate in
regulating BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 transcript and
protein expression in AML cells.

HDACs 1 and 2 cooperate in regulating the
expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 in
AML cells
To further investigate which HDAC isoforms,
among HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, play important
roles in regulating expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and
RAD51 in AML cells, we individually knocked down
HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 in THP-1 cells (Figure
4A, designated THP-1/HDAC1, THP-1/HDAC2, and
THP-1/HDAC3, respectively; Western blot verification
of knockdown was previously published [15]). Then we
determined BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 transcript and
protein levels in these cells by real-time RT-PCR and
Western blotting, respectively. As show in Figure 4B and
4C, HDAC1, HDAC2 or HDAC3 knockdown did not affect
BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 transcript and protein levels in

Simultaneous inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2
enhances the antileukemic activities of ara-C and
DNR against AML cells
To determine the effects of HDAC1 and HDAC2 on
the antileukemic activity of ara-C and DNR, we treated
THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cells with FK228 and ara-C or
DNR, alone or in combination, for 48 h. The cells were
then subjected to flow cytometry analyses for apoptosis
and cell cycle progression. The results revealed that

in THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cells (Figure 6A and 6C),
accompanied by reduced expression of BRCA1, CHK1,

cell lines (Figure 6E and 6F). These results are similar to
those following MGCD0103 treatment, suggesting that
inhibiting HDAC1 and HDAC2 has the same effect of
decreasing the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51,
as inhibiting HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 together.

enhancing ara-C-induced apoptosis in pediatric AML
cells [15]. However, which HDAC isoforms participate in
regulating the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51
in AML cells remains unknown. Solving this problem
could help us better understand the specific function of
individual HDACs, which is essential for the development
of new therapies, as well as for rationally designing
combination therapies for the treatment of AML.
Treatment with a Class II HDACI, MC1568
or Tubastatin A, had no effect on BRCA1, CHK1, or

DISSCUSSION
In our previous study, we demonstrated that
panobinostat (pan-HDACI) suppresses the expression of
three critical DDR proteins, BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51,
leading to enhancement of DNA DSBs, abrogation of cell
cycle checkpoints, and enhanced induction of apoptosis
by ara-C or DNR in AML cells [14]. We also found
that inhibition of both HDACs 1 and 6 was critical in

transcript levels for BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 in
THP-1 and OCI-AML3 cells. MGCD0103 enhanced
DNA DSBs and apoptosis induced by ara-C or DNR, and
it also abrogated S and/or G2/M checkpoint activation
induced by ara-C or DNR in these cells (Figure 3). These
results are consistent with our previous findings using
panobinostat [14], suggesting that HDAC1, HDAC2,
and HDAC3 participate in the regulation of BRCA1,
CHK1, and RAD51 expression and play important roles
in the antileukemic activities of ara-C or DNR in AML
cells.
While individual knockdown of HDAC1, HDAC2
or HDAC3 did not alter BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51
expression, combined inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2
decreased their expression. Our results were consistent
with Miller et al. who demonstrated that HDAC1 and
HDAC2 promote double-strand break repair [17], though
the mechanism was not determined. It has been reported
that inhibition of HDAC2 causes downregulation of
RAD51 in melanoma cells [18]. Thurn and colleagues
have reported that inhibition or siRNA knockdown of
both HDAC1 and HDAC2 not only resulted in decreased
BRCA1 transcript levels, but also ATM transcript and

protein levels as well [19]. Although we did not investigate
ATM levels, HDAC1 and HDAC2 inhibition caused
decreased transcript and protein levels of BRCA1, CHK1,
and RAD51 in AML cells.
In summary, our study demonstrates that
simultaneous inhibition of both HDAC1 and HDAC2
decreases the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51,
induces DNA DSBs and apoptosis, and abrogates cell cycle
checkpoint activation induced by ara-C or DNR in AML
cells. pan-HDACIs have been shown to decrease BRCA1,
CHK1, and RAD51 expression through transcriptional
regulation, of which E2F1 plays a critical role [14, 20],
and post-translational mechanisms [21]. In addition, in
AML cells it has been shown that inhibition of HDAC1
and HDAC2 causes upregulation of miR-182 which
directly targets RAD51, resulting in decrease of RAD51
expression [22]. These studies indicate that HDAC1 and
HDAC2 regulate the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and
RAD51 through both transcriptional and post-translational
mechanisms. Our data support combining a class I HDACI
with DNA damaging agents for the treatment of AML and
provide guidance for the further development of HDAC
selective inhibitors.

Apoptosis

GRANT SUPPORT

AML cells were treated with the indicated drugs
for 48 h and then subjected to flow cytometry analysis
to determine drug-induced apoptosis using an Annexin
V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/PI apoptosis Kit
(Beckman Coulter; Brea, CA, USA), as previously
described [24, 28]. Experiments were performed 3
independent times in triplicates. Results from one
representative experiment are shown.

This study was supported by grants from the
National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC
31271477 and NSFC 31471295, China Scholarship
Council, Hyundai Hope on Wheels, LaFontaine Family/U
Can-Cer Vive Foundation, Kids Without Cancer, Children’s
Hospital of Michigan Foundation, Decerchio/Guisewite
Family, Justin’s Gift, Elana Fund, Ginopolis/Karmanos
Endowment and the Ring Screw Textron Endowed Chair
for Pediatric Cancer Research. The funders had no role in
study design, data collection, analysis and interpretation of
data, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

Cell cycle progression
Cells were treated with the indicated drugs for 48 h.
The cells were harvested and fixed with ice-cold 80% (v/v)
