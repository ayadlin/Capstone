BACKGROUND. The authors conducted a phase 2 trial of the antiepidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody cetuximab in combination with the
gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) regimen in patients with documented progressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

METHODS. Forty-five untreated patients with advanced-stage progressive HCC
were prospectively enrolled. Treatment consisted of cetuximab at a dose of 400
mg/m2 initially then 250 mg/m2 weekly, plus gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2
on Day 1 and oxaliplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Day 2, every 2 weeks. Treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal.

RESULTS. Overall, 306 cycles were administered. Grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity
consisted of thrombocytopenia (24%), neutropenia (20%), and anemia (4%).

Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors system
(RECIST).6,7 However, the natural history of HCC is
highly variable, and the conventional RECIST system
is probably unsuitable in a proportion of patients.8
In particular, slow-growing tumors are far from rare
in this setting, and this complicates the interpretation of disease stabilization rates in clinical trials.9,10
One way to reliably test the disease-modifying effects
of a new treatment in a phase 2 study is to enroll
only patients with progressive disease at baseline.
During the past 3 years encouraging preliminary
results have been obtained with new targeted therapies in HCC.9–17 However, despite the highly vascularized character of these tumors and the role of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in HCC
neovascularization,18 bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF
monoclonal antibody, appears to have good tolerability but only modest clinical efficacy when given
alone16 or in combination with the GEMOX regimen17 to carefully selected patients. Recently, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-inhibiting agents
such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) erlotinib
and gefitinib, and the chimeric immunoglobulin (Ig)
G1 monoclonal antibody cetuximab, have been registered for the treatment of various neoplasms. The
use of anti-EGFR therapies in HCC is based on the
importance of EGFR and its ligands EGF and transforming growth factor (TGF–a) in hepatocarcinogenesis19 and on EGFR expression by HCC cell lines and
tissue.20,21 Anti-EGFR monotherapy in HCC patients,
using either TKI11,12 or monoclonal antibodies,13 has
so far given disappointing results. However, although
cetuximab has been shown to be more effective in
combination with chemotherapy in colorectal cancer,22 to our knowledge this combination has never
been tested in HCC patients.
This phase 2 trial was designed to evaluate the
efficacy and tolerability of the combination of
GEMOX and cetuximab combination in patients with
progressive advanced stage HCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were eligible if they had advanced stage
HCC not amenable to curative treatment. HCC had
to be pathologically documented, regardless of EGFR
expression status, or to meet the following criteria:
a-fetoprotein (AFP) level over 400 ng/mL, together
with a hypervascular liver tumor and cirrhosis. Other
inclusion criteria were as follows: measurable disease
according to the RECIST system,8 with at least 1
lesion measuring at least 2 cm on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

performed <20 days before accrual; documented
progressive disease on 2 consecutive CT scans and/
or MRI performed at a 2-month interval, or clinical
progression according to RECIST; compensated
Child-Pugh stage A or B cirrhosis, score <9; no previous systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy for HCC;
age at least 18 years; and World Health Organization
(WHO) performance status (PS) of 0 to 2. The
patients had to have adequate blood cell counts
(neutrophils >1.5 3 109/L and platelets >100 3 109/L)
and renal function (creatinine <120 lmol/L) within
the 2 weeks before study entry. Exclusion criteria
included known central nervous system metastases;
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; an
interval shorter than 8 weeks since transarterial chemoembolization (if performed); a history of sensory
peripheral neuropathy; and alkaline phosphatase >5
times the upper normal limit (UNL), prothrombin
time <60%, serum albumin <30 g/L, and bilirubin
1.5 UNL.
Pretreatment investigations included a complete
medical history and physical examination, AFP assay,
electrocardiogram, hematologic and biochemical
profiles, abdominal CT or MRI, and thoracic CT in
case of suspected lung metastases. Body weight, PS,
and clinical manifestations were recorded before the
outset of therapy. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices and was
approved by the Pitié-Salpétrière Ethics Committee.
All patients provided written informed consent.

Treatment Protocol and Dose Modification
Cetuximab (Erbitux, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
was administered intravenously at an initial dose of
400 mg/m2 infused over 120 minutes on the first day
of chemotherapy, followed by weekly infusions of 250
mg/m2 over 60 minutes. Premedication consisted of
antihistamine administration. In case of grade 3 skin
toxicity, cetuximab infusion could be delayed for up
to 2 consecutive weeks. At the second or third occurrence of grade 3 skin toxicity, cetuximab infusion
was again delayed for up to 2 consecutive weeks,
with concomitant dose reductions to 200 and 150
mg/m2, respectively. Patients were to discontinue
cetuximab if more than 2 consecutive infusions were
withheld or if grade 3 skin toxicity occurred a fourth
time despite appropriate dose reduction. Topical
and/or oral antibiotics were permitted to facilitate
recovery from cutaneous toxicity. Cetuximab was discontinued in the case of any grade 3 or 4 infusionrelated reaction.
Chemotherapy consisted of gemcitabine at a
dose of 1000 mg/m2 as a fixed-dose-rate intravenous
infusion of 10 mg/m2/minute on Day 1 followed by

GEMOX Plus Cetuximab in HCC/Asnacios et al.

oxaliplatin at a dose of 100 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on Day 2. Treatment was repeated every 2
weeks. If grade 3/4 (non-neurosensory) toxicity
occurred the subsequent cycle was postponed until
recovery to grade <2; the gemcitabine dose was then
reduced to 800 mg/m2 and the oxaliplatin dose to 80
mg/m2. If grade 3 (oxaliplatin-specific scale23) cumulative sensory peripheral neuropathy occurred, oxaliplatin was discontinued and gemcitabine was
administered alone as initially scheduled. Preventive
calcium and magnesium infusions were used.24
Antiemetic prophylaxis was recommended. Treatment was continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal, or until
chemotherapy had to be delayed for more than 3
weeks because of toxicity.

Response Assessment
It must be stressed that only patients with documented progressive HCC were eligible for this study. The
primary endpoint for efficacy was the objective
response rate (ORR), defined as the sum of complete
and partial responses based on the RECIST system.8
Tumor responses were assessed by means of helicoidal CT every 2 months (after 4 cycles), or earlier in
patients with suspected disease progression. Complete responses (CR) were defined as complete disappearance of all assessable disease. Partial responses
(PR) were defined by a decrease of >30% in the sum
of the largest dimensions of target lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined as a decrease of <30% or an
increase of <20% in measurable lesions. Progressive
disease (PD) was defined as an increase of at least
20% in measurable lesions or the appearance of new
malignant lesions. A second CT scan was performed
4 and 8 weeks after the first to confirm CR and PR.
All CT scans of patients with disease response were
reviewed by an external response review committee
(ERRC), composed of 2 independent radiologists not
involved in the study. Secondary endpoints for efficacy included progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times. AFP levels were measured every 2
months. Body weight, PS, and symptoms were
recorded before each cycle.
Toxicity Assessment
Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer
Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (NCI-CTCAE; version 3.0, December 2003),
based on clinical and biologic findings before each
treatment cycle (weekly for hematologic and biochemical toxicities), then at the end of treatment and
1 month later. The patients were interviewed before
each session, focusing on pain, nausea, vomiting,

2735

mucositis, diarrhea, asthenia, weight loss, and dermatologic and neurologic disorders. The oxaliplatinspecific scale was used to assess oxaliplatin-induced
neurotoxicity.23 All patients who received at least 1
dose of study treatment were evaluated for toxicity.

Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was the ORR, as assessed by
the ERRC, and its exact 95% confidence interval
(95% CI). The 1-sample multiple testing procedure
for phase 2 clinical trials was used to calculate the
sample size.25 On the basis of an anticipated ORR of
25% for GEMOX plus cetuximab, and the best rates
obtained in recent trials (approximately 10%), a total
of 42 patients were required with a 5 5% and b 5
20%. The secondary efficacy endpoints were the disease control rate (DCR: CR 1 PR 1 SD), changes in
the AFP plasma level, and PFS and OS. The toxicity
analysis was based on the worst grade in each
patient during any chemotherapy cycle. All analyses
were performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis.
The results were expressed as the mean  standard
deviation, or range, as appropriate. Follow-up started
at the first dose of study treatment. The censoring
event for responses was the onset of disease progression. The censoring event for survival was the date of
death. Survival curves were plotted with NCSS 2001
software (Number Cruncher Statistical Systems,
Kaysville, Utah) using the Kaplan-Meier method.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between November 2005 and October 2006, 45
patients with unresectable or metastatic HCC were
enrolled and treated at 4 French centers. All the
patients had documented progressive HCC at study
entry. The median age was 63 years and 89% of the
patients were men. The median WHO PS was 1 and
the median CLIP (Cancer of the Liver Italian Program) score was 2. Thirteen patients (29%) had extrahepatic metastases. Underlying cirrhosis was present
in 80% of patients (Table 1).
Efficacy
In the ITT population (n 5 45), the ORR after ERRC
review was 20% (95% CI, 0.11-0.34) with 9 partial
responses (Table 2). The responses lasted from 2 to
14 months. Stable disease was observed in 40% (95%
CI, 0.27–0.55) of patients, giving a DCR of 60% (95%
CI, 0.45–0.73). In assessable patients who had at least
1 postbaseline tumor assessment (n 5 39) the disease control rate was 69% (PR, 23% and SD, 46%).
One patient with PR underwent secondary resection

but the differences were not statistically significant
(disease control rate 71% vs 47% [P 5 .13]; median
PFS of 8.3 vs 3.9 months [P 5 .20]).

Treatment Exposure
Overall, 306 cycles of treatment were administered to
the 45 patients, with a mean of 6 cycles per patient
(range, 1-27 cycles). The relative dose intensities
were 89.5% for cetuximab, 88% for gemcitabine, and
84% for oxaliplatin. The chemotherapy dosage was
reduced in 19 patients (42%), because of hematologic
toxicity (n 5 14) or grade 2 oxaliplatin-induced neurosensory toxicity (n 5 5), after a mean of 12 weeks
(range, 1-22 cycles) on full treatment. The cetuximab
dose was reduced in only 1 patient, for recurrent
grade 3 skin toxicity, and cetuximab therapy was discontinued in another patient because of a recurrent
allergic reaction. At the time of last follow–up. treatment had been discontinued in 41 patients because
of surgery (n 5 1), disease progression (n 5 23),

adverse events (n 5 9), patient refusal to continue
(n 5 4), or death (n 5 4). Death occurred more than
4 weeks after the last treatment infusion in 3 patients
and 1 died from a car accident. All were then not
considered as related to the study treatment.

Toxicity
Myelosuppression, skin toxicity, and neurotoxicity
were the most frequent adverse effects (Table 3).
Only 2 grade 4 events were observed (thrombocytopenia and neutropenia). Grade 3 adverse events
occurred in 22 patients (49%). Hematologic grade 3
toxicity consisted of thrombocytopenia (no bleeding
events) in 10 patients (22%), neutropenia in 8
patients (20%; no febrile neutropenia), and anemia
in 2 patients (4%). Nonhematologic grade 3 toxicity
consisted of skin rash in 7 patients (16%), neurotoxicity in 5 patients (11%), and nausea/vomiting in 1
patient. Three grade 2 allergic reactions were
observed. No treatment-related deaths occurred.
Subsequent Treatments
Sixteen patients received subsequent treatments.
Seven patients received tamoxifen. Chemoembolization; oxaliplatin plus mangafodipir; docetaxel; and
the combination of epirubicin, capecitabine, and cisplatin were each administered to 2 patients. One
patient received sorafenib.

DISCUSSION
In recent randomized trials using the RECIST system,
the disease remained stable after 2 months in as
many as 30% to 47% of patients who received no
active treatment.9,10 We therefore decided to enroll
only HCC patients with documented disease progres-

2737

sion in this phase 2 trial of the GEMOX-cetuximab
combination.
The EGFR pathway is involved in hepatic carcinogenesis,26 HCC growth, and HCC dissemination.
Approximately 70% of human HCCs express this receptor.20 Anti-EGFR therapies have been shown to
prevent HCC development in animals19 and to inhibit the growth of human HepG2 HCC cells in a
time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner.21 Cetuximab was recently evaluated in HCC
patients who had previously received 1 or 2 systemic
chemotherapy regimens.13 Cetuximab was well tolerated, and trough concentrations were not notably
affected by these patients’ mild to moderate hepatic
dysfunction. However, there were no tumor
responses, and the median PFS was only 1.4 months.
The authors advocated trials of cetuximab-chemotherapy combinations as first-line treatment. Indeed,
cetuximab is more effective when combined with
chemotherapy in other settings,22 and such combinations have synergistic antiproliferative activity on
HepG2 cells in vitro.21 To our knowledge, ours is the
first trial of cetuximab plus chemotherapy as firstline treatment for patients with advanced-stage HCC.
The results are promising. Cetuximab plus chemotherapy was associated with a confirmed ORR of
20% and a DCR of 60%, whereas the median PFS and
OS times were 4.7 months and 9.5 months, respectively. No major differences between the assessments
of the investigators and those of the external review
committee were observed. Only 1 of 10 responses
was downgraded (to stable disease) by the ERCC.
Although these results are very similar to those of our
previous trials of GEMOX chemotherapy alone (DCR
of 70%, median PFS of 5.6 months),6,7 these studies
are not comparable. Indeed, the patients included in
the present study had documented disease progression at study entry, and thus a poorer prognosis, than
those enrolled in the 2 previous GEMOX trials. More
relevant, a retrospective review of patients with documented HCC progression (over 2 months), hospitalized in our unit between 2000 and 2001 (n 5 37) and
treated with tamoxifen, an ineffective drug in this setting, showed median PFS and OS times of 1.8 months
and 4.3 months, underlining the particularly poor
prognosis of this rapidly progressive population.
Moreover, half the patients in the present study had a
CLIP score of 3, approximately one-third had metastatic disease, and one-quarter had Child B cirrhosis.
Despite the very poor prognosis of our study population, the results of GEMOX plus cetuximab therapy
compare favorably with those of other anti-EGFR
treatments tested in HCC patients. Small molecules
that inhibit the EGFR intracellular TK domain have

2738

been evaluated in 3 phase 2 trials,11,12,15 2 with erlotinib11,12 and 1 with lapatinib.15 Both drugs proved safe
and modestly effective. The response rates ranged
from 0% to 9%, and 32% of patients were free of disease progression at 4 months and 6 months in the
studies conducted by Thomas et al.12 and Philip
et al,11 respectively. Many antiangiogenic agents have
also been tested, alone or combined with chemotherapy, because of the hypervascular nature of HCC.
Bevacizumab,16,17 thalidomide,27,28 and sunitinib29,30
showed modest clinical efficacy, with an ORR of 0%
to 8% and a median PFS of 1.4 to 6.4 months in
patients without documented progression at study
entry. More recently, a large randomized phase 3 trial
demonstrated that sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor
with antiangiogenic properties, was more effective
than a placebo (increased median PFS and OS times)
as first-line treatment for advanced HCC in Child A
patients.10
A cetuximab-related rash is predictive of antitumoral efficacy in a variety of other settings,22,31–33
possibly because it reflects adequate receptor saturation by the antibody. Recently, the EVEREST trial33 in
colorectal cancer patients has even shown that
increasing the dose of cetuximab in patients who did
not initially manifest a rash may add benefit. In our
study the efficacy of the GEMOX-cetuximab combination tended to be higher in patients with cutaneous toxicity, but the population was most likely too
small to detect a significant difference. An ancillary
study of factors predictive of treatment efficacy,
including EGFR amplification and K-Ras and BRAF
mutational status, is currently ongoing in this same
population.
The GEMOX-cetuximab combination had an acceptable safety profile in these patients with progressive, advanced-stage HCC, most of whom also had
cirrhosis. With monitoring and dose modification,
patients with disease response and stable disease
were able to continue treatment for protracted periods. The frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events
was similar to that observed with GEMOX alone,
except for cetuximab-related skin toxicity and mild
to moderate infusion-related reactions, which
occurred in 16% and 4% of patients, respectively. No
toxic deaths occurred. Symptomatic treatment always
successfully reduced the severity of grade 3 skin
reactions to grade 2 or less.
In conclusion, the GEMOX-cetuximab combination appears to be relatively active and well tolerated
in HCC patients with advanced-stage progressive disease. The relative good disease control rate (60%)
and progression-free survival time (4.7 months) can
be confidently attributed to the experimental treat-

ment. A randomized trial comparing GEMOX alone
with the GEMOX-cetuximab combination is currently
in preparation.
