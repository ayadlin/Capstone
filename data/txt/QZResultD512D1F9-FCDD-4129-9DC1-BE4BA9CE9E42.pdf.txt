BACKGROUND: Using phase 3 trial data for sunitinib versus interferon (IFN)-a in treatment-naive patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, retrospective analyses characterized sunitinib-associated fatigue and its impact on patient-reported health-related quality of
life (HRQoL). METHODS: Patients received sunitinib at a dose of 50 mg/day on a schedule of 4 weeks on/2 weeks off (375 patients) or
IFN-a at a dose of 9 MU subcutaneously 3 times per week (360 patients). HRQoL was self-assessed using the Functional Assessment of
Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index–15-item (FKSI-15) questionnaire, with fatigue assessed using its Disease-Related Symptoms
subscale. Fatigue was also assessed by providers using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). A repeatedmeasures model (M1) and random intercept-slope model (M2) characterized sunitinib-associated fatigue over time. Another repeatedmeasures model examined the relationship between HRQoL scores and CTCAE fatigue grade. RESULTS: M1 demonstrated that the initial
increase in patient-reported fatigue with sunitinib was worst during cycle 1, with mean values numerically better at subsequent cycles;
most pairwise comparisons of consecutive CTCAE fatigue cycle means were not found to be statistically significant. M2 demonstrated
that the overall trend (slope) for patient-reported and CTCAE fatigue with sunitinib was not statistically different from 0. The relationship
between most HRQoL scores and CTCAE fatigue was close to linear regardless of treatment, with lower scores (worse HRQoL) corresponding to higher fatigue grade. The majority of HRQoL scores were better with sunitinib versus IFN-a for the same CTCAE fatigue
grade. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported worse fatigue during the first sunitinib cycle. However, in subsequent consecutive cycles, less
fatigue was reported with no statistically significant worsening. CTCAE fatigue assessment may not fully capture patient treatment exC 2014 The Authors. Cancer published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Cancer Sociperience. Cancer 2014;120:1871-80. V

INTRODUCTION
In patients with advanced cancer, fatigue is frequently a priority symptom1 and may adversely impact quality of life
because of its effects on physical functioning, social functioning, activity level, and emotional well-being. Fatigue is also a
common adverse event (AE) associated with treatments of advanced cancer, including interferon (IFN) and targeted therapies (such as those approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma [RCC]), as well as tyrosine kinase and mammalian target of
rapamycin inhibitors.2-4 For example, fatigue has been reported as an AE in approximately 40% to 70% of patients with
advanced RCC treated in clinical trials with sunitinib malate.5-8 Sunitinib is an orally administered multitargeted inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptors, and other receptor tyrosine kinases, and is approved globally for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC; imatinib-resistant/imatinib-intolerant
gastrointestinal stromal tumors; and progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
In oncology trials, the severity of AEs is usually assessed by the treating physician using the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE).9 Because this assessment is performed by an outside
observer and not the patient, it has generally been considered an “objective” measure of treatment impact. However,
provider-reported ratings may not accurately or consistently depict the full effect of an AE on a patient, particularly when
the AE is subjective, such as with fatigue, nausea, or pain.10-13 Furthermore, reporting of AEs from clinical trials is typically based on overall frequency, neglecting the time course (ie, when AEs develop during treatment, whether they persist

Study Design and Treatment

A total of 750 patients with treatment-naive metastatic
RCC were randomized 1:1 to receive sunitinib at a dose
of 50 mg/day for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks off treatment (schedule 4/2), in repeated 6-week cycles, or IFN-a
as a subcutaneous injection on 3 nonconsecutive days per
week at a dose of 3 million units (MU) for the first week,
6 MU for the second week, and 9 MU thereafter. In both
treatment arms, dose modifications were allowed to manage toxicity. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.

or resolve, etc). In contrast, relative to CTCAE assessment, patient-reported outcomes may provide a more
detailed understanding of symptom data and their effects
on functioning and well-being, including their development and impact over time.13
Using data from a pivotal phase 3 trial of sunitinib
versus IFN-a in treatment-naive patients with metastatic RCC,6,7 2 independent but complementary retrospective analyses were conducted to characterize the
patient fatigue experience while undergoing sunitinib
treatment and to investigate the subsequent impact of
fatigue on patient-reported health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). The latter analysis was conducted because
patients may not experience fatigue uniformly across
treatments and HRQoL assessment has the potential to
provide a more holistic picture. In brief, a better understanding of these issues may allow for more timely and
effective intervention to help manage fatigue and thus
optimize clinical benefit with sunitinib in patients with
advanced RCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

The current study enrolled patients aged  18 years with
histologically confirmed metastatic RCC with clear cell
histology. Key eligibility criteria included6,7: no previous

HRQoL Outcomes

As previously reported,6,14 HRQoL was assessed during
the study using 3 psychometrically tested patient selfreported questionnaires: the Functional Assessment of
Cancer Therapy-Kidney Symptom Index–15-item
(FKSI-15) (Fig. 1),15 the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G),16 and the EuroQoL
Group’s 5-dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire.17 Patients
completed the questionnaires on days 1 and 28 of each
treatment cycle (reflecting sunitinib’s intermittent treatment schedule) to measure HRQoL across the full course
of therapy, both during active treatment and after a treatment break, and at the end of treatment or study withdrawal. HRQoL scores were averaged for each patient by
cycle.
HRQoL outcomes evaluated in the current analysis were scored as follows. The FKSI-15 total score
ranged from 0 (most severe symptoms and concerns) to
60 (no symptoms and concerns). The 9-item FKSI–
Disease-Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS) subscale had a
potential total score of 0 (all most severe symptoms) to
36 (no symptoms), with the 15 individual items of the
FKSI each scored on a range from 0 to 4. The total
FACT-G score ranged from 0 (worst cancer-related
QoL) to 108 (best cancer-related QoL), in which each
question of the FACT-G Physical Well-Being, Social/
Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being, and Functional Well-Being subscores ranged from 0 to 4. The
EQ-5D–weighted health index score included scores of
1, 0, or < 0, denoting that the corresponding health
state is valued by the population as equivalent to full
health, death, or worse than death, respectively. The
EQ-visual analog scale or health state thermometer

score ranged from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to
100 (best imaginable health state).
Fatigue Assessment

Fatigue was self-assessed by patients as part of the FKSIDRS subscale, scoring the item “I feel fatigued” from 0
(very much) to 4 (not at all). As with other AEs (when applicable), fatigue was also provider-assessed, monitored
throughout the study, and graded on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 4 (highest) by treating physicians using NCI
CTCAE (version 3.0),18 in which grade 1 is defined as
mild fatigue over baseline, grade 2 as moderate or causing
difficulty performing some activities of daily living, grade
3 as severe fatigue interfering with activities of daily living,
and grade 4 as disabling fatigue. Fatigue could be spontaneously reported as an AE at different time points because
it occurred within and across cycles (with no baseline
value, unlike HRQoL assessment) and at different grades.
In this retrospective assessment, reported severity grades
for AE fatigue were averaged by cycle for each patient. A
value of 0 was assigned if a patient did not report fatigue
as an AE during a given cycle.
Statistical Analysis

Two types of models were used to investigate the time
course of patient-reported fatigue and provider-assessed AE
fatigue across cycles with sunitinib treatment: a repeatedmeasures model and a random intercept-slope model.19,20
They included all available longitudinal data on the outcome variable for every patient from the sunitinib treatment arm and considered the FKSI-DRS item “I feel
fatigued” and the AE fatigue as outcome (dependent) variables in separate models with time as a predictor. In the
models with the FKSI-DRS fatigue item as the outcome,
its baseline score was also included as a covariate. In the
repeated-measures model, time was represented by a cycle
and taken as a categorical predictor, indicating that no
functional relationship was imposed between outcome and
time. To account for repeated measurements on an individual, the covariance of the residual (error) terms over time
was based on a first-order autoregressive structure. In this
model, FKSI scores were averaged for each patient by cycle.
Because of the small number of observations at later cycles,
data from cycles 22 to 30 were collapsed and represented as
1 (mean) value per patient, which is consistent with the analytical approach used for previous analyses of HRQoL
data from this trial.21 In the random intercept-slope model,
time was used as a continuous predictor, with a linear
relationship imposed between outcome and time. The
Cancer

June 15, 2014

covariance structure of the random effects (intercepts and
slopes) was unstructured.
In a complementary analysis, another repeatedmeasures mixed-effects model was used to examine the
relationship between provider-assessed AE fatigue and
patient-reported HRQoL to determine whether patients
with the same grade of fatigue severity have the same
HRQoL while receiving 2 different treatments (sunitinib
and IFN-a). All available longitudinal data regarding
each HRQoL outcome variable for every patient from
both treatment arms were used. Averaged fatigue grades
for each patient by cycle were rounded into original metric values (eg, 0, 1, or 2). The AE-fatigue-grade-bytreatment interaction term was used as the predictor.
Because AE fatigue grade was used as a categorical variable, no functional relationship between HRQoL scores
and fatigue grade was imposed. Because there were no
reports of CTCAE grade 5 fatigue and only very few cases
of grade 4 fatigue reported, data for grade 4 fatigue were
collapsed together with those for grade 3. Therefore, the
AE fatigue was represented only by grades 0, 1, 2, and 3 in
the analyses. Again, because of the small number of observations, data from cycles 22 to 30 were averaged together.
To account for repeated measurements on the same individual, the covariance of the residual (error) terms over
time was based on a first-order autoregressive structure.
Because the analysis itself did acknowledge and account
for the longitudinal structure of data, estimated relationships between the AE fatigue and HRQoL scores can be
applied at any time point.
Finally, for each modeled outcome, we used residual
diagnostics to assess the adequacy of the fitted model. Residual plots were studied (scaled residuals vs predicted
means and scaled residuals vs theoretical normal quantiles).
RESULTS
Patients

As previously reported,6,14 there were no significant differences noted with regard to the baseline characteristics of the
patients randomized to sunitinib or IFN-a, including baseline QoL scores, which were in the moderate range (eg,
baseline FKSI-DRS scores [mean 6 standard deviation]
were 29.74 6 5.24 and 29.55 6 5.03, respectively, for
patients on the sunitinib and IFN-a treatment arms).
Fit of Models

For each modeled outcome, scaled residuals versus theoretical normal quantiles formed a straight line for the vast majority of the observations; scaled residuals versus predicted
means did not demonstrate any systematic patterns and

Modeling the Time Course of Patient-Reported
Fatigue

Results from the repeated-measures model with the FKSIDRS item “I feel fatigued” (Fig. 2) demonstrated that the
initial increase in patient-reported fatigue was worst during the first cycle of sunitinib (from a mean of 2.91 at
baseline to a least-squares mean of 2.29 at cycle 1, corresponding to an estimated effect size of 0.58 for the change
in fatigue). In addition, mean fatigue values for subsequent cycles were numerically better than (and for most
comparisons, also statistically different from) the value in
the first cycle (Table 1).
Results from the random intercept-slope model also
demonstrated that fatigue was stable over time (after the
initial increase in fatigue during the first cycle to a leastsquares mean of 2.55, corresponding to an estimated
effect size of 0.34 for the change in fatigue). The overall

Results from the repeated-measures model demonstrated
some fluctuations in AE fatigue over time with sunitinib

most pairwise comparisons of the cycle mean values (with
the exception of one value) were not statistically significant, indicating that the mean values at every cycle were
actually not different from one another.
Results from the random intercept-slope model

fatigue (ie, grade 0), scores for all outcomes were numerically superior with sunitinib compared with IFN-a. In
most instances, these differences were also statistically significant (P < .05). For fatigue grades 1 and 2, differences
in all outcomes but one (the FKSI item “I have pain”)
numerically favored sunitinib and the majority of differences were statistically significant. A similar pattern for
grade 3 fatigue also favored sunitinib, but only a few
results were found to be statistically significant, potentially due to the smaller sample size.

CTCAE fatigue was close to linear in both treatment
groups, with lower (worse) HRQoL scores on most measures corresponding to a higher mean fatigue grade (Figs. 4
and 5), except for HRQoL measures not directly linked
with fatigue (ie, the FACT-G Social/Family Well-Being
subscore and the FKSI items “I have bone pain,” “I have
been coughing,” “I am sleeping well,” “I worry that my
condition will get worse,” and “I am bothered by fevers”).
For nearly all outcomes (FKSI, FKSI-DRS, FACT-G, and
EQ-5D [data not shown]), regardless of whether they were
aggregated or single items, patients treated with sunitinib
had noticeably better HRQoL scores than patients in the
IFN-a group for the same CTCAE severity of fatigue. For
example, the FKSI-DRS subscale and FKSI items “I have a
lack of energy” and “I feel fatigued” scores were both higher
with sunitinib than with IFN-a at each CTCAE grade of
fatigue (Figs. 4A-4C). The same pattern was observed for
the relationship between the total FACT-G score and the
FACT-G Physical Well-Being and Social/Family WellBeing subscores (Figs. 5A-5C).

DISCUSSION
The purpose of these unique retrospective analyses was to
characterize the patient fatigue experience while receiving
sunitinib treatment and to investigate its expected adverse
impact on patient-reported HRQoL. The results demonstrated that patients with metastatic RCC reported worse
fatigue during the first cycle of sunitinib treatment compared with baseline; however, no significant worsening of
fatigue was reported in all consecutive treatment cycles.
The overall trend was stable, demonstrating no significant
increase in reported fatigue after the first follow-up assessment in cycle 2. More specifically, based on the estimated
effect size for the random intercept-slope model, the magnitude of change in fatigue during the first cycle can be
characterized as a small-to-medium change22,23 that continued during subsequent cycles, whereas according to the
repeated-measures model, the magnitude of change in fatigue during the first cycle can be described as a medium
change22,23 that recovered to the effect levels of the random intercept-slope model at subsequent cycles. Similarly, provider-assessed fatigue, using the NCI CTCAE
grading system, suggested no significant change in the AE
fatigue over time for patients treated with sunitinib, even
though subjective symptoms such as fatigue are often not
uniformly reported between clinicians and patients.24
Findings similar to those of the current study may have
been reported anecdotally by some clinicians, given their
experience with sunitinib, but to the best of our knowledge the current study is the first formal analysis to confirm and quantify this observation.
It is interesting to note that patients treated with
sunitinib who experienced the same CTCAE grade of fatigue as patients treated with IFN-a generally had more
favorable HRQoL scores, as measured by the FKSI-15,
FKSI-DRS, FACT-G, and EQ-5D questionnaires. As
expected, fatigue had a negative impact on HRQoL outcomes, except when assessed by HRQoL measures not
directly linked with fatigue (such as the FKSI item “I have
been coughing”). The relationship between most HRQoL

quality of life or fewer symptoms).

outcomes and fatigue was close to linear in both treatment
groups, with lower HRQoL scores (representing worsening HRQoL) generally corresponding to a higher mean fatigue grade. These findings are consistent with previous
studies across a range of cancer diagnoses in which the
degree of patient-reported fatigue was inversely correlated
with physical functioning, performance of everyday activities, and HRQoL.25-27
The finding that HRQoL scores were superior with
sunitinib compared with IFN-a is also consistent with
previous reports of HRQoL data from this trial, in which
within-treatment decreases for FKSI-15 and FKSI-DRS
scores after the first cycle of treatment were also reported
(although more pronounced for IFN-a).14,21 HRQoL
1876

scores may have been influenced by other AEs and
disease-relieving symptoms that favored sunitinib over
IFN-a (eg, its superior efficacy as measured by
progression-free survival).6 For example, it was previously
reported that patients receiving sunitinib had less experience with lack of energy, breathlessness, weight loss, and
fever as well as less fatigue than patients treated with IFNa in this trial.21 Patients treated with sunitinib were also
significantly more likely to report being able to sleep well,
enjoy life, and have a good appetite, all of which would
impact on their overall QoL.21 Other factors that may
have affected HRQoL scores were the timing and frequency of fatigue, the dosing schemes used (schedule 4/2
for sunitinib vs continuous treatment for IFN-a), and/or

the timing of HRQoL assessment; further research on this
topic is warranted. It is interesting to note that the incidence of treatment-related CTCAE (version 3) fatigue of
any grade reported in the current trial was similar for the
sunitinib and IFN-a treatment groups (54% and 52%,
respectively) and the incidence of grade 3/4 fatigue did
not significantly differ between treatments (11% and
13%, respectively).7 Hence, relying on frequency estimates of AEs from clinical trials may provide an inaccurate and/or incomplete understanding of differences in
tolerability between treatments (eg, lack of information
regarding onset of AEs), which is an important concern in
comparative efficacy trials in which provider-rated
CTCAE assessment is relied on to determine differences
in patient experience.
Cancer

Although the results of the current analyses are consistent with those of previous studies, some limitations are
recognized. First, because clinician reporting of AEs
depends on what the patient conveys, the severity of AE
reporting can be influenced by patient and provider characteristics that influence communication, such as assertiveness, stoicism, and clinician bias. In addition, there
was the potential for variability in how physicians chose to
manage fatigue, from “doing nothing” to dose modification to possible active treatment (eg, methylphenidate).
There may also be more specific or “endorsed” tools for
assessing fatigue than those used here (eg, the Brief Fatigue Inventory or the Functional Assessment of Chronic
Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale).28,29 The possible influences of dose reduction and/or patient dropout after the first

for IFN-a. Note that all statistically significant between-treatment differences favored sunitinib over IFN-a. FACT-G indicates

cycle were also not examined, although the latter was
investigated previously for between-treatment HRQoL
results in this trial, using a pattern mixture model as a sensitivity analysis.21 According to the results of the pattern
mixture model, patient dropout did not notably influence
the results. In addition, the possible role of a “response
shift” effect,30 in which health changes lead to shifts in internal standards, values, and conceptualization of HRQoL
by patients, was not investigated or taken into account.
Finally, in exploratory studies such as this, in which data
are collected with an objective but not with a prespecified
hypothesis, multiplicity of data, hypotheses, and analyses
can result in errors of inference, requiring the use of multiplicity corrections.31 However, no adjustment was made
for multiple testing in the current study. Therefore,
1878

“significant” results (P < .05) based on these retrospective
analyses must be qualified as having resulted from retrospective data, and any corresponding hypotheses must be
tested in confirmatory studies.
In conclusion, the finding that sunitinib-related fatigue occurs early can be used to enhance education and
preparedness among patients who have been prescribed
sunitinib for the treatment of advanced RCC. It also
highlights the importance of setting upfront expectations
regarding the fatigue experience so that patients do not
prematurely withdraw from treatment, thereby failing to
take advantage of the potential clinical benefit of sunitinib.32,33 For example, retrospective analyses of pooled
clinical trial data for sunitinib in patients with metastatic
RCC have preliminarily identified treatment-associated
Cancer

fatigue as a potential biomarker of sunitinib efficacy.34
In addition, the results of the current study may lead to
improved implementation of fatigue-specific coping
strategies35 by both the patient and those involved with
his/her care, thereby helping to motivate the patient to
remain on therapy and adapt to this potentially disabling
AE over the course of treatment. That CTCAE assessment of fatigue does not fully capture the patient’s treatment experience indicates that a more comprehensive
measure is needed, one that includes the patient’s perspective in addition to the physician’s assessment (which
neither version 3 or the most recent update, version 4, of
the NCI CTCAE do)36; however, the contribution of
insufficient grade level options to the inadequacy of
CTCAE assessment cannot be excluded as a possible factor (in addition to inappropriate physician reporting). In
addition, the impact of fatigue severity must be understood in the context of the treatment being received,
including other toxicities. Use of HRQoL measures can
be an important tool for the treating physician in this
regard, complementing CTCAE assessment. Such measures can provide a better understanding of more subjective AEs such as fatigue, which are reported sporadically,
and take into account the entire treatment experience
over time, ultimately leading to improved patient
management.
