ABSTRACT
Hexamethylene bisacetamide-inducible protein 1 (HEXIM1) is best known as
the inhibitor of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and is recently
identified as a novel positive regulator of p53. We previously showed the basic region
(BR) of HEXIM1 mediates the binding of HEXIM1 to a nucleolar protein, nucleophosmin
(NPM), and can be ubiquitinated by human double minute 2 protein. Here we identify a
cytotoxic peptide derived from the BR of HEXIM1. When fused with a cell-penetrating
peptide, the HEXIM1 BR peptide triggers rapid cytotoxic effect independent of p53.
Similarly, when the BR peptide is linked with a breast cancer cell targeting peptide,
LTV, the LTV-BR fusion peptide exhibits specific killing of breast cancer cells, which
is not observed with the commonly used cytotoxic peptide, KLA. Importantly, the BR
peptide fails to enter cells by itself and does not induce any cytotoxic effects when
it is not guided by any cell-penetrating or cancer targeting peptides. We showed
that HEXIM1 BR peptide depolarizes mitochondrial membrane potential in a p53dependent manner and its cell-killing activity is not suppressed by caspase inhibition.
Furthermore, we observed an accumulation of the internalized BR peptide in the
nucleoli of treated cells and an altered localization of NPM. These results illustrate
a novel mechanism which the BR peptide induces cell death and can potentially be
used as a novel therapeutic strategy against breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

associate with estrogen receptor α (ERα), which is widely
targeted in breast cancer therapy. HEXIM1 exhibits
its anti-cancer effects through the inhibition of the
ERα-dependent gene expression [8]. Our previous
studies have demonstrated the functional interactions
between HEXIM1 and other critical proteins involved
in cancer, including the tumor suppressor p53, human
double minute-2 protein (HDM2), and nucleophosmin
(NPM). HEXIM1 directly binds to p53 and stabilizes p53
by blocking the HDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53.
Furthermore, HEXIM1 is required for p53 activation
induced by anti-cancer drugs/compounds [9, 10]. We
have earlier identified six lysine residues located within
the BR of HEXIM1 (i.e. Lys-150-152 and Lys 159-161)
as the major sites for HDM2 ubiquitination. The HDM2ubiquitinated HEXIM1 exhibits a stronger inhibition

HEXIM1 was originally identified from vascular
smooth muscle cells treated with hexamethylene
bisacetamide (HMBA), an anti-proliferation compound
[1]. To date, HEXIM1 is best known as the inhibitor of
positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which
controls the elongation phase of RNA polymerase II
transcription and is required for transcriptional regulation
of human immunodeficiency virus [2, 3]. HEXIM1 blocks
the activity of P-TEFb only when associated with the 7SK
small nuclear RNA (snRNA) through its basic region
(BR), while neither 7SK snRNA nor HEXIM1 alone
instigates any effects [4–7].
The potential involvement of HEXIM1 in cancers
was first reported in 2003. HEXIM1 was found to

in P-TEFb-dependent transcription [11]. HEXIM1 also
binds to NPM [12], a nucleolar protein which serves an
important factor in ribosome biogenesis [13, 14] and has
been implicated in DNA replication, transcription and
repair [15]. About 35% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
patients carry the cytoplasmic-misallocated mutant form
of NPM, NPMc+ [16]. NPMc+ is found to interact and
sequester a portion of HEXIM1 in the cytoplasm of the
NPMc+ AML cell line and activates P-TEFb-dependent
transcription, suggesting the involvement of HEXIM1 in
tumorigenesis of AML [17].
A commercially available p53 activating peptide,
which contains a cell-penetrating peptide fused with a
p53 peptide, which contains the HDM2-ubiquitinated
sites (i.e. a.a. 361–382), is reported to induce apoptosis in
mutant and wild-type p53-bearing human cell lines [18].
The internalized p53 peptide is likely to compete with the
endogenous p53 protein in binding to HDM2 and protect
the endogenous p53 from HDM2-mediated ubiquitination,
resulting in stabilization and activation of p53. We reason
that the HEXIM1 BR may exhibit similar function by
disrupting the p53-HDM2 interaction. In this study, we
evaluate the potential use of the HEXIM1 BR peptide as
the therapeutic peptide against breast cancer. Interestingly,
we find that the HEXIM1 BR peptide induces potent
and rapid cytotoxicity through a novel p53-independent
mechanism. Our results show that HEXIM1 BR peptide
exhibits specific cell killing when directed by a breast
cancer targeting peptide, suggesting the use of the BR
peptide in anti-tumor strategies.

cytotoxicity on both cell lines, raising the possibility that
the cell killing mediated by FGF-BR might not depend on
p53 (Figure 1C). Similar result was obtained for human
cervical cancer cells, HeLa cells, when treated with
FGF-BR peptide (Figure 1C). Comparable cytotoxicity
was also observed in normal cells, including HEK293
cells and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) (Figure 1C),
suggesting the cytotoxic effect of BR peptide occurs to all
cell types once it is internalized into cells.
We tested the effects of FGF-BR peptide on
HCT116 (p53 KO) cells and HCT116 (p53 WT) was used
as a control cell line. FGF-BR induced cell death in both
cell lines with similar potency, while the negative control
peptide, FGF-X13, did not reduce cell viability in both
cell lines (Figure 1D). We next generated a fusion peptide,
FGF-BR-RRR12, in which all six HDM2 ubiquitinating
lysine residues were mutated to arginine and could
no longer be ubiquitinated by HDM2 (Figure 1B). If
BR peptide induces cell death through the HDM2-p53
regulatory pathway, BR-RRR12 mutant is expected to
lose its cytotoxic effects since HDM2 will continue to
ubiquitinate p53 for degradation and inhibit cell death.
Interestingly, the data suggests that FGF-BR-RRR12
peptide demonstrated stronger cellular toxicity when
compared to the wild-type FGF-BR peptide (Figure 1D).
Furthermore, we observed that the status of p53 had
no effects on the potency of FGF-BR-RRR12 peptide,
providing more evidence that the cell death caused by the
BR peptide was not p53-dependent.
HEXIM1 is known as a negative regulator of
P-TEFb through the association with 7SK snRNA [4]. The
7SK snRNA binding motif, KHRR, is present within the
cytotoxic BR peptide. When KHRR was mutated to ILAA
(Figure 1B), the mutant HEXIM1 could not associate with
7SK snRNA or inhibit P-TEFb activity [4]. We found that
FGF-BR-ILAA peptide maintained its killing capacity
in both HCT116 (p53 WT) and HCT116 (p53 KO) cell
lines, indicating that P-TEFb might not be involved in the
HEXIM1 BR-mediated cell killing (Figure 1D).
We next investigated the mechanism of cell death
induced by the HEXIM1 BR peptide. To monitor the
real-time changes to the cells upon treatment with BR
peptide, we examined the effect of FGF-BR on HCT116
(p53 WT) and HCT116 (p53 KO) cells in a live cell
imaging setting. Cells treated with FGF peptide were
included as a control. Within minutes, FGF-BR peptide
rapidly induced drastic changes to the cell morphology
with rupturing of the plasma membrane accompanied
with damages to the nuclear membrane and abnormalities
to the nucleolus in both cell types (Figures 2A and S1).
No effects were detected when cells were treated with
FGF peptide (Figure 2A). Similar observations were seen
for MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with LTV-tagged
BR peptide, which BR peptide is conjugated to a breast
cancer-targeting peptide, LTV (data not shown). We rule
out the possibility that HEXIM1-BR leads to apoptosis. In
our study, BR-induced cytotoxicity occurred in minutes,

RESULTS
HEXIM1 BR peptide induces cell death
independently of p53, P-TEFb, and apoptosis
in vitro
Since HDM2 can ubiquitinate both p53 and
HEXIM1, we sought to determine the sequence similarity
in HDM2 ubiquitination sites between p53 and HEXIM1.
The high sequence similarity in location of the six lysine
residues suggests that HEXIM1 peptide may activate p53,
resulting in p53-dependent cell cycle arrest or cell death
(Figure 1A). It is known that a commercial p53 activating
peptide, FGF-p53, contains the p53 ubiquitination sites
(a.a. 361–382) conjugated to a hydrophobic cell-membrane
translocating peptide derived from Kaposi fibroblast
growth factor (FGF) [19]. We generated a FGF-BR fusion
peptide, in which the cell-penetrating FGF peptide was
fused with HEXIM1 BR peptide containing the HDM2
ubiquitination residues (a.a. 147–164) (Figure 1B). We
treated two acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines,
AML2 and AML3, with FGF-BR peptide to determine the
effects of the peptide on cell viability. It has been reported
that the p53 level in AML2 is significantly higher than that
in AML3 [17] . Despite this, FGF-BR exhibited similar

whereas the duration of apoptosis is estimated from
12 to 24 hours [20]. In addition, the induction of cell death
in LTV-BR-treated MCF7 cells could not be inhibited by a
pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-Fmk (100 µM) (Figure 2B),
indicating that HEXIM1-BR induced cell death is
independent of apoptosis.

residues. We observed that FGF-BR-treated HCT116 (p53
WT) cells experienced rapid mitochondrial depolarization
within three minutes (Figure 3A), which is similar to the
time frame that morphological changes occurred upon
addition of the FGF-BR peptide (Figure 2A). It is known
that p53 translocates to the mitochondria and results in
reduction of MMP in p53-mediated apoptosis [23]. Our
study showed that the MMP of FGF-BR-treated HCT116
(p53 KO) cells did not decrease (Figure 3B) although these
cells encountered rapid cytotoxicity similar to HCT116
(p53 WT) as mentioned earlier (Figure 2A). We reasoned
that the depolarization of MMP induced by FGF-BR might
not be essential to trigger rapid cell death. Collectively,
our data supports that HEXIM1 BR peptide is likely to
induce cell killing though an alternative pathway that acts
independently of p53 and apoptosis.

HEXIM1 BR peptide induces rapid
depolarization of mitochondrial membrane
potential in a p53-dependent manner
It has been reported that a commonly used cytotoxic
basic peptide, KLA, initiates apoptotic cell death by
disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
[21, 22]. It is possible that HEXIM1 BR utilizes similar
approach to kill cells as it also contains many basic

HEXIM1 BR peptide alters subcellular localization
of NPM and reduces its protein expression

of basic residues found in the BR peptide sequence. These
truncated peptides were fused to LTV and introduced to
MDA-MB-231 cells. The results suggest that only the
region encompassing the second and third stretch of basic
residues (HRRRPSKKKRHW) is more critical in exerting
cytotoxic activity as compared to the first stretch of basic
residues (Figure S2). We proceeded to replace stretches of
basic residues to alanine residues in the active region of BR
and obtained similar conclusion on the importance of the
same stretches of basic residues (HRRRPSKKKRHW) as
essential for inducing cytotoxicity (Figure S3). Nonetheless,
all three stretches of basic residues are required to exhibit
the maximum cytotoxic effect against MDA-MB-231 cells.
KLA peptide, a cytotoxic peptide, was often fused
with a cancer-targeting peptide or conjugated to antibodies
recognizing cancer cells to exert cell-killing effect in anticancer therapy [27, 28]. We generated LTV-KLA peptide
and compared its effect to that of LTV-BR peptides.
LTV-KLA exhibited stronger inhibition on the viability
of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5B). However, we found
that the untagged KLA peptide alone showed non-specific
killing on MDA-MB-231 cells, while BR- or BR-RRR12treated cells remained highly viable (Figure 5D). LTV-KLA
exhibited non-specific cell killing on non-breast cancer
cell lines, CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) and OPM-2
(multiple myeloma) cells, while little or no effects were
observed in the LTV-BR-treated cells (Figure S4A and S4B).
Similar observations were seen for normal human
fibroblasts HFF and WI-38, indicating the specificity of
LTV-BR towards breast cancer cell lines but not LTV-KLA
(Figure S4C and S4D). Thus, the use of KLA as the toxic
load in anti-cancer therapy is likely to be questioned on its
specificity. As untagged HEXIM1 BR peptide is unable
to kill cells when it is not fused with any cell-penetrating
or targeting peptides, our data suggest that HEXIM1 BR
peptide may be a safer alternative as compared to KLA,
for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics.
The HEXIM1 BR peptide did not cause any cytotoxic
effect when it was not fused with a cell-penetrating
(i.e. FGF) or cancer cell targeting (i.e. LTV) peptide. It is
possible that the untagged HEXIM1 BR peptide may fail
to internalize into cells by itself without specific guidance.
To test this hypothesis, we treated MCF7 cells with
fluorescent-labeled BR, LTV-BR, KLA, and LTV-KLA
peptides and examined the intracellular distribution of
these peptides using confocal microscopy. No fluorescent
signal was detected in the DMSO vehicle control as well as
BR peptide (Figure 6A). LTV-BR was readily internalized
into MCF7 cells and distributed in cytoplasm and nuclei
(Figure 6A). It was noted that its strong fluorescent signals
were primarily localized in the nucleoli (Figure 6A,
LTV-BR-FITC). Detection of fluorescent signals
in KLA-treated cells helps to explain the nonspecific cytotoxicity induced by KLA peptide
(Figure 6A), while no fluorescent signal was
observed in HEXIM1 BR-treated cells, indicating

NPM is an abundantly expressed nucleolar protein
and a key regulator in ribosome biogenesis [13, 14]. The
BR domain of HEXIM1 is known to contain a nucleolar
localization signal. When BR was fused with yellow
fluorescent protein (YFP), the BR-YFP was localized to
the nucleolus [24]. In our previous study, we had identified
NPM as a HEXIM1 binding protein partner and that the
BR domain of HEXIM1 was required for NPM binding
[12]. To investigate the effect of BR peptide on NPM,
FGF-BR-treated HCT116 (p53 WT) and HCT116 (p53
KO) cells were immunostained with an anti-NPM antibody
to examine the sub-cellular distribution of NPM. Normal
nucleolar localization of NPM was observed in control
experiments [Figure 4A, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
FGF-X13], but mislocalization of NPM was detected when
cells were incubated with FGF-BR (Figure 4A, FGF-BR)
in both cell types. Furthermore, we observed a reduction
in NPM protein level in the FGF-BR treated HCT116
(p53 WT) and HCT116 (p53 KO) cells as compared
to controls (Figure 4B). Various post-translational
modifications of p53, namely phosphorylation and
acetylation, have been shown to stabilize and activate p53
in response to cellular stress [25, 26]. We then determined
the expression levels of phosphorylation of p53 on Ser15
and acetylation of p53 on Lys382 and found that they
remained unchanged in HCT116 (p53 WT) cells when
treated with FGF-BR peptide (data not shown), suggesting
a p53-independent pathway to trigger cell death. These
results demonstrate that the BR peptide may interfere with
protein translation/ribosome biosynthesis by disrupting
sub-cellular localization of NPM and decreasing its
expression, hence compromising its normal function.

LTV-BR fusion peptide kills breast cancer cells
selectively
To explore the potential use of the cytotoxic
HEXIM1 BR peptide in cancer therapy, we fused a
breast cancer targeting peptide LTV, to HEXIM1 BR and
BR-RRR12 to generate the fusion peptides namely,
LTV-BR and LTV-BR-RRR12. Both peptides exhibited
anti-proliferative effects against two breast cancer cell
lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, while cells remained
viable when treated with LTV-X13 control peptide
(Figure 5A and 5B). Although MDA-MB-231 cells
are triple-negative with the absence of expression of
oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2,
LTV-BR and LTV-BR-RRR12 elicited similar anti-cancer
activity as compared to MCF7 cells (Figure 5B). In
addition, untagged control X13 and the two BR peptides
had no effect on cell viability (Figure 5C and 5D). To
define the active region of the BR peptide, we generated
a series of truncated BR peptides based on the stretches

DISCUSSION

that the BR peptide could not enter the cells by itself
(Figure 6A, BR-FITC). Cells treated with LTV-KLA
demonstrated that the sub-cellular localization of the
peptide was observed mainly in the cytoplasm (Figure 6A).
The different distribution of LTV-BR and LTV-KLA
suggests that BR and KLA may utilize different
mechanisms for cell killing. Flow cytometric analysis
was also performed to quantify the amount of internalized
fluorescent peptide in MCF7 cells. LTV peptide directed
the uptake of almost 100% of LTV-fused peptides
(i.e. LTV-BR and LTV-KLA) into the breast cancer cell
line (Figure 6B). Approximately 65% of KLA-FITCtreated MCF7 cells internalized KLA-FITC, whereas there
was no entry of BR-FITC into MCF7 cells (Figure 6B).
These results clearly demonstrate the safety feature of
HEXIM1 BR peptide when compared to the non-specific
cytotoxic KLA peptide. LTV assisted in the cellular
internalization of HEXIM1 BR peptide into its target cells
and the nucleolar localization of the fusion peptide might
be subsequently guided by BR peptide.

In this study, we report the potential use of a novel
cytotoxic peptide derived from the BR of HEXIM1. When
fused with a cell-penetrating (FGF) or a breast cancertargeting (LTV) peptide, the HEXIM1 BR fusion peptide
induces rapid cell death in vitro through an apoptosis- and
p53-independent mechanism. This is accompanied with
the disruption of sub-cellular localization and reduction
in the protein level of NPM, which compromise ribosome
biogenesis and limit protein synthesis. In addition to its
role in protein translation, NPM is required to maintain
DNA integrity in cells. Knockout of NPM results in
accumulation of DNA damage, which clearly indicates
the essential role of NPM in cell proliferation and survival
[29]. We showed that HEXIM1 BR rapidly depolarizes
MMP only in presence of p53. This is unlikely a major
factor leading to cell death as cells without p53 are
also subjected to cytotoxicity induced by HEXIM1 BR
peptide. Since HEXIM1 BR peptide severely damages

the fundamental biological function essential to all cell
types, we reason that the peptide could be utilized in the
development of novel treatment against drug-resistant
cancer guided by a specific cancer targeting peptide.
In addition, cancer cells tend to evade apoptosis
by overexpressing anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2
[30, 31] or down regulating pro-apoptotic proteins [32].
The duration of apoptosis is estimated between 12 to
24 hours [20]. In our study, we demonstrated that treatment
with FGF-BR peptide rapidly induces cell death in minutes
(Figure 2A). Moreover, the morphological changes seen
in FGF-BR treated HCT116 cells (Figure S1) do not
resemble the characteristics of cells dying by apoptosis
which include membrane blebbing and formation of
apoptotic bodies [33]. Cell swelling and subsequent
rupturing of the plasma membrane followed by rapid lysis
of the cells observed were descriptive of necrosis instead

(Figures 2A and S1) [34]. It is unlikely that the conjugated
HEXIM1-BR peptide triggered apoptosis in the treated
cells based on the time frame observed for inducing cell
death and the ability to kill cells despite the presence of
the caspase inhibitor (Figure 2B). Hence, using this BR
peptide provides an attractive approach to eliminate cancer
cells that have a defective apoptotic pathway.
Interestingly, we showed that the BR peptide alone
did not reduce cell viability, as compared to the KLA
peptide (Figure 5D). The effect of adding KLA peptide has
been shown to induce significant non-specific cell death in
several cell lines [27, 28, 35]. Our data also suggested that
KLA alone could be internalized into cells and decrease
cell viability (Figure 6A). Therefore, KLA peptide may
not be an ideal toxin used to generate a therapeutic
fusion peptide due to its non-specific toxicity. The use of
toxic peptides in generation of antibody-drug conjugate

Immunoblotting analysis

(ADC) has been shown previously with the use of KLA
[27, 36]. It is predictable that a portion of the ADCs will
be broken down before reaching the target cancer cells,
even though non-cleavable linkers may be used to generate
these conjugates. As such, KLA peptides may be released
from the conjugates, resulting in an off-target killing of
normal cells/tissues. Treating cells with HEXIM1 BR alone
had minimal effects to the cells as the peptide could not
be internalized by itself (Figure 6A). We believe that the
BR peptide can provide a better choice than KLA peptide
in the generation of a safer ADC in anti-cancer treatment
and efforts to conjugate the BR peptides to other potential
monoclonal antibodies targeting against cancer are ongoing.
Taken together, we demonstrate the potential use of
the HEXIM1 BR peptide in cancer therapy. Importantly,
our data show the safety aspect of HEXIM1 BR peptide
compared to other cytotoxic peptides. The HEXIM1
peptide induces rapid and potent cytotoxicity only when the
peptide is internalized within the cells, which supports its
further consideration as a promising therapeutic approach
in treatment of any forms of cancers by fusing to different
targeting peptides which recognize specific cancer cells.

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl,
(pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, Protease Inhibitor tablet (Roche)] and used
for western blotting. Western blotting was carried out as
previously mentioned [9]. The primary antibodies used in
this study included anti-NPM (Invitrogen) and anti-actin
(Millipore). The film of western blot was scanned, and the
protein bands were quantified by the GS-800 densitometer
(Bio-Rad). The protein level of NPM was quantified after
normalizing with the loading control, actin.

Cell viability and cytotoxicity assays
Cells were plated in clear-bottomed white walled
96-well plates (Corning) and incubated overnight.
Cells were treated with indicated peptides in 1% FBScontaining media for overnight or indicated timings at
37°C. Cell viability was measured with CellTiter-Glo
reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For cytotoxicity assay, cells were plated
in black walled 96-well plates (Corning) to allow
them to adhere overnight. Upon treatment with a pancaspase inhibitor, z-VAD-Fmk (100 μM) (Sigma)
and subsequent treatment with LTV-tagged peptides,
cytotoxicity induced was determined by CellTox
cytotoxicity assay (Promega) 30 minutes after addition
of peptides according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Luminescence was determined using an Infinite 200
multiplate reader (Tecan).

MDA-MB-231 and OPM-2 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (Gibco) containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. All cells were routinely maintained in a
37°C incubator with 5% CO2.

Measurement of MMP
The cationic fluorescent dye 1, 1′, 3,
3′-tetraethylbenzamidazolocarbocyanin iodide (JC-1)
(Invitrogen) was utilized for MMP measurement. JC-1
was dissolved in DMSO (200 μM). Peptide-treated cells in
96-well deep sided, clear bottom, dark sided microplates
were incubated with media containing JC-1 for 30 min
at 37°C and then washed twice with warm PBS.
Changes in MMP were determined using a multiplate
spectrofluorometer (Tecan) [excitation: 475 nm; emission:
530 nm (green); emission: 590 nm (red)]. The decrease
in the ratio of red to green fluorescence was used to
determine relative mitochondrial depolarization.

Peptide synthesis

Flow cytometry

All peptides used in this study were chemically
synthesized and purified by high performance liquid
chromatography with > 98% purity (First Base,
Singapore). Their sequences are available in the Table S1.
Stock solutions were obtained by reconstituting the
powder in sterile water or 50% DMSO and stored
at −80°C.

MCF7 cells were plated on 6-cm culture dish to
allow overnight adherence. FITC-labeled peptides (30 μM)
were added to the cells, incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and
subsequently washed three times with PBS. The cells were
then trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and finally
resuspended in 500 μl ice-cold 2% FBS-containing PBS
for flow cytometry analysis.

REFERENCES

For staining with anti-NPM, cultured cells were
fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma) for
10 min, and then in methanol for 10 min, washed in PBS
and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.5%
bovine serum albumin) for 1 hour prior to incubation with
a mouse anti-NPM antibody (Invitrogen) in blocking
buffer for overnight at 4°C. Cells were then incubated with
Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson
Immuno Research Laboratories) for 1 hour, washed three
times with PBS and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) -containing mounting solution
(Vectashield). Stained cells were examined with a
LSM 510 confocal microscope using a 63 × objective
lens (Zeiss).
To determine the ability of FITC-labeled peptides to
enter the cells and to visualize intracellular distribution of
the peptides, MCF7 cells were plated on 4-chamber glass
cover slides (Lab-Tek) to adhere overnight, incubated with
FITC-labeled peptides (30 µM) for 30 min, and then washed
three times with PBS before being fixed and mounted with
DAPI-containing mounting solution (Vectashield). Images
were acquired using a Nikon A1R confocal laser scanning
microscope equipped with a 60 × oil-immersion objective
lens (SBIC-Nikon Imaging Centre).
