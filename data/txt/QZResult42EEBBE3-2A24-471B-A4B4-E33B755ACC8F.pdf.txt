Abstract:

The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib has been identified as a potent
enhancer of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in several human cancers. However, the
identification of the underlying molecular mechanisms of this synergistic cell
death induction has been ongoing over the last years. A recent study identifies
a new mechanism of action for the synergism of TRAIL and Bortezomib.

molecular mechanisms that are responsible for this
synergistic induction of apoptosis has been the subject of
intensive investigations over the last years.
A recent study identifies a novel mechanism of
action that underlies the synergistic cooperation of
TRAIL and Bortezomib by demonstrating for the first
time that Bortezomib enhances the stability of TRAILderived tBid, the cleaved form of Bid [8]. Bid is a
pro-apoptotic BH3-only domain protein of the Bcl-2
family [9]. Upon stimulation of death receptors such as
TRAIL receptors or CD95, activation of caspase-8 at
the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) results in
the proteolytic processing of Bid into tBid [2]. tBid in
turn translocates to mitochondria to promote activation
of Bax and Bak, cytochrome c release into the cytosol
and caspase activation, thus connecting the extrinsic to
the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis [2]. The novelty of the
current study resides in the demonstration that TRAIL
and Bortezomib act together to cause the accumulation
of tBid at the mitochondria [8]. To this end, tBid was
found to accumulate at higher levels in cells that were
treated with the combination of Bortezomib and TRAIL
compared to cells that were exposed to TRAIL alone [8].
Since tBid has been reported to be prone to proteasomal
degradation upon its ubiquitination [10], proteasome
inhibition by Bortezomib prevents the degradation of tBid
that is newly generated upon stimulation with TRAIL
via TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation, leading to the
accumulation of tBid. This conclusion is supported by
data showing that cells, which were treated with TRAIL to
trigger the cleavage of Bid to its truncated form tBid, then
washed to remove the remaining TRAIL and incubated in

Evasion of apoptosis (programmed cell death)
belongs to the hallmarks of cancers and contributes
to tumor progression and treatment resistance [1].
There are two major apoptosis signaling pathways that
culminate in the activation of caspases, i.e. the death
receptor (extrinsic) pathway, which is triggered by the
ligation of death receptors at the cell surface, and the
mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway, which involves the
release of apoptogenic proteins from mitochondria into
the cytosol to initiate caspase activation [2]. In principle,
agents that trigger agonistic TRAIL receptors such as
TRAIL receptor antibodies or recombinant soluble
TRAIL present promising cancer therapeutics, since they
can directly initiate the apoptotic machinery in cancer
cells [3]. However, many human cancers have developed
mechanisms to escape the induction of apoptosis upon
treatment with TRAIL [4]. This underscores the need to
identify and validate novel agents that could be used in
combination protocols with TRAIL receptor targeting
agents to potentiate the antitumor activity of TRAILbased regimens.
Inhibition of the proteasome presents one such
strategy to enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells towards
TRAIL. For example, Bortezomib (PS-341, VELCADE)
is a dipeptidyl boronic acid compound that reversibly
blocks the proteolytic activity of the proteasome and
is a FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of multiple
myeloma [5]. While Bortezomib has been shown to
increase the sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in
several human cancers as single agent and in combination
protocols [6, 7], the identification of the underlying

the presence of the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.
fmk to prevent any further processing of Bid by activated
caspases, harboured markedly increased levels of tBid
compared to cells, which were incubated in the absence
of Bortezomib after the initial stimulation with TRAIL
[8]. Since no tBid is produced any longer after removal
of TRAIL and in the presence of the caspase inhibitor
zVAD.fmk, neither by ongoing TRAIL stimulation
(since TRAIL was removed by a washing step) nor by
continued caspase activity (due to the addition of the
wide-range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk), tBid levels
under these experimental conditions are largely controlled
by its degradation rate. Thus, the breakdown of tBid
after TRAIL stimulation was substantially delayed in
the presence of Bortezomib compared to cells that were
incubated in the absence of Bortezomib after exposure
to TRAIL. These findings support the conclusion that
treatment with TRAIL results in cleavage of Bid into tBid,
while the addition of Bortezomib markedly increases the
stability of tBid that is produced by TRAIL-stimulated
proteolytic cleavage. The functional relevance of tBid in
the Bortezomib-conferred sensitization of neuroblastoma
cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was demonstrated by
RNA interference experiments showing that silencing of
Bid also significantly reduced apoptosis in cells co-treated
with TRAIL and Bortezomib [8]. Together, these results
demonstrate that Bortezomib primes for TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis at least in part by stabilizing tBid.
Various mechanisms of action have been proposed to
mediate the cooperative action of TRAIL and Bortezomib
in the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells, involving
Fig. 1 of both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathway
modulation
of apoptosis. As far as the intrinsic apoptosis signaling
pathway is concerned, Bortezomib has been reported to
stimulate upregulation of the BH3-only domain proteins

Bim and/or Bik [11, 12], to block the degradation of
Bax [13] or to promote the release of Smac from the
mitochondria into the cytosol [14]. Also, Bortezomib
alone or in combination with TRAIL has been shown to
downregulate or cleave anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such
as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL or Mcl-1 [15, 16]. It is interesting to note
that Noxa turned out in the current study to determine
only the kinetic of apoptosis induction, while it became
dispensable for apoptosis upon prolonged exposure
to Bortezomib and TRAIL [8]. In contrast, Noxa has
been shown to be a critical mediator of apoptosis upon
monotherapy with Bortezomib [17-19], pointing to
differences in the role of Noxa between single agent and
combination therapy with Bortezomib.
Bortezomib-mediated modulation of the extrinsic
pathway of apoptosis has been attributed to upregulation
of the agonistic TRAIL receptors TRAIL-R1 and/or
TRAIL-R2 in several studies [16, 20-26], to promote
the formation of the TRAIL DISC [27], to downregulate
c-FLIP expression [27-29] or to block the degradation
of caspase-8 [30]. Also, reduced expression of XIAP
has been linked to Bortezomib-mediated sensitization to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis [31-33] as well as inhibition of
NF-κB by Bortezomib [24, 34].
In addition to providing new mechanistic insights
into the synergistic interaction of Bortezomib and TRAIL
the present study is the first demonstration that Bortezomib
acts in concert with TRAIL in a childhood cancer, i.e.
neuroblastoma. Previous studies on the combination of
TRAIL and Bortezomib were performed in adult tumors.
As single agent, Bortezomib has been reported to suppress
neuroblastoma growth in preclinical studies [35-38],
also in chemoresistant or metastatic disease [39-41]. By
comparison, Bortezomib showed limited in vitro or in
vivo activity as monotherapy when it was tested against

Figure 1: Scheme of the role of Bid for the synergistic interaction of TRAIL and Bortezomib. TRAIL induces cleavage of
Bid into tBid, while Bortezomib increases the stabilization of tBid by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of
tBid at mitochondrial membranes. This in turn promotes activation of Bax/Bak, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol,
caspase-3 activation and caspase-dependent apoptosis.

preclinical testing program that includes models for
neuroblastoma [42]. In phase I clinical trials in children
with refractory solid tumors or leukemia Bortezomib
proved to be well tolerated, although little single agent
activity was reported [43, 44]. Together with our findings
showing that Bortezomib sensitizes neuroblastoma cells
towards TRAIL, the currently available data indicate
that Bortezomib represents an interesting experimental
agent for the treatment of neuroblastoma especially
in combination protocols, which warrants further
investigation.
