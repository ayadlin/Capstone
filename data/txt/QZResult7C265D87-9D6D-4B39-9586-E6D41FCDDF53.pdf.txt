BACKGROUND. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor cetuximab
is active in recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head
and neck (SCCHN). The activity of cetuximab was compared with that of commonly used treatments in this setting.

METHODS. All patients had recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN and had progressed on cisplatin- or carboplatin-based chemotherapy. Efficacy data from 3 pro-

spective studies (n 5 278 patients) that administered cetuximab as a single agent
(n 5 103 patients) or combined with either cisplatin/carboplatin (n 5 96 patients)
or cisplatin (n 5 79 patients) were compared with the results from a retrospective
study of patients who received various second-line treatments (all treatments
including best supportive care only, n 5 151 patients; chemotherapy, n 5 43
patients). Safety data considered were only those from the cetuximab studies.

RESULTS. Over the 3 cetuximab trials, overall response rates from 10% to 13%
and disease control rates from 46% to 56% were observed. The median time to
disease progression ranged between 2.2 months and 2.8 months, and the median
overall survival ranged between 5.2 months and 6.1 months. No patients who
progressed on cetuximab alone responded to additional platinum. These survival
data compared favorably with those from the retrospective study (median survival, 3.4 months [n 5 151 patients] and 3.6 months [n 5 43 patients]). Cetuximab-based treatments generally were tolerated well, and cetuximab did not
increase the side effects associated with platinum therapy.

CONCLUSIONS. Cetuximab has the potential to prolong survival in patients with
recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN who fail on platinum therapy compared with
various second-line therapies. Cetuximab did not increase the toxicities associated with chemotherapy. The results obtained by treatment with cetuximab
alone after platinum failure did not appear to differ from the results obtained by
reintroducing platinum in combination with cetuximab. Cancer 2008;112:2710–9.

noses and >300,000 deaths attributed to this disease.1 Most head and neck cancers, approximately
90% in Western societies, are squamous cell carcinomas (SCCHN). The prognosis depends primarily on
disease stage and performance status at the time of
diagnosis.2,3
The currently available treatment options for
recurrent and/or metastatic disease are limited.
Depending on the extent of disease and the performance status of the patient, they are reirradiation, salvage surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy plus
chemotherapy (chemoradiotherapy), and best supportive care (BSC). Chemotherapy is generally the
treatment of choice when reirradiation is no longer
possible. Methotrexate and cisplatin are used commonly in this setting. Patients who receive first-line
platinum-based regimens for recurrent and/or metastatic disease generally have a survival of 6 months
to 9 months.4,5 In patients who have progressive disease (PD) while they are receiving platinum-based
regimens, the projected median survival falls to
approximately 3.5 months.6,7 Further active therapies, such as taxane- and vinorelbine-based regimens, may be considered in patients with recurrent
and/or metastatic disease who have a good performance status.8–10 However, at this point, many patients
will receive only BSC.
Because current treatment options are so limited,
there is a clear need for new therapies for patients
with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN. Moleculartargeted therapies have attracted attention as potential candidates for the treatment of head and neck
cancers. Among such agents are those that target the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).11 EGFR
generally is expressed at high levels in SCCHN12–14
and is associated with a poor prognosis in terms of
disease-free survival and overall survival.13,15
Cetuximab (Erbitux; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany) is an immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal
antibody that was designed specifically to block
human EGFR signaling by binding irreversibly, and
with higher affinity than its natural ligands, to the
extracellular domain of the receptor.16 This binding
stimulates EGFR internalization and degradation,
which results in receptor down-regulation. Furthermore, occlusion of the ligand-binding site by cetuximab competitively inhibits endogenous ligand
binding, thereby preventing dimerization and subsequent activation of the intrinsic receptor tyrosine
kinase activity.17–20
In combination with radiotherapy, cetuximab has
demonstrated important activity in patients with
locally advanced SCCHN.21,22 In a randomized Phase
III study, the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy

2711

significantly prolonged overall survival by nearly 20
months versus radiotherapy alone (49 months vs 29.3
months; P 5 .03).22 The hazard ratio was 0.74, representing a 26% reduction in the risk of death. In addition, the risk of locoregional recurrence was reduced
by 32% in the cetuximab plus radiotherapy arm.
Cetuximab also has demonstrated activity
against recurrent and/or metastatic disease in the
first-line setting when given in combination with cisplatin23 and with cisplatin or carboplatin plus 5fluororacil.24,25 When initial platinum-based therapy
has failed, encouraging results have been reported in
patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN for
cetuximab both as monotherapy26,27 and in combination with either cisplatin or carboplatin.28–31
The objective of the analysis reported here was
to determine more precisely the scope of cetuximab
activity in recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN in
patients who progressed on platinum-based therapy
by comparing the intention-to-treat efficacy data
from 3 Phase II cetuximab studies with a retrospective study of a similar group of patients who were
receiving various types of treatment outside an investigational setting.6,7,26–31

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Designs
This analysis compared data from 3 prospective
Phase II studies with cetuximab in patients with
recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN who progressed
on platinum-based therapy,27,28,30 all of which followed an open, multicenter design, with data from a
retrospective study of various second-line treatments
in a similar group of patients.6,7 The 3 prospective
studies were designed to investigate the efficacy and
safety of either cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin.
The principles of the study designs and their key
inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in
Table 1; full details are available in the respective
publications. Criteria for platinum resistance in each
of the studies are shown in Table 2.
With respect to the 3 prospective studies, the
individual protocols and amendments were approved
by independent ethics committees in each country.
The studies were conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki (1996), and all patients provided written informed consent. In the case of the
retrospective study, because data were collected retrospectively in an anonymous fashion from patient
files, neither informed consent nor ethical approval
was necessary. However, an independent ethics committee in Italy approved the protocol.

The analysis described here, which originally was
presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (2005), was conducted
before the availability in the literature of full details
for all studies. At the time this report was written, all

of the studies had been published. In this current
report, the most recent publications of the studies
were used in addition to the original presentation to
provide information on the designs, patient eligibility, and other relevant information. However, most of

the data are presented according to the original analysis: When data were derived from a different source,
this is clearly indicated in the text.

Treatments Administered
The cetuximab monotherapy study had a 2-phase
design.27 First, patients received cetuximab monotherapy at an initial dose of 400 mg/m2 followed by
subsequent weekly 1-hour infusions of 250 mg/m2
until PD. Patients who progressed on cetuximab
monotherapy were offered salvage therapy with
cetuximab plus platinum and entered a second combination-therapy phase of the study.
In the studies of cetuximab in combination with
platinum, patients received cetuximab at the same
schedule that was used in the monotherapy study,
but this was followed by platinum chemotherapy
either at the same dose and schedule at which PD had
been documented before entry into the study28,29 or
at a dose of 75 mg/m2or 100 mg/m2 (cisplatin).30,31
Patients received a minimum of 2 cycles28,29 or 4
cycles30,31 of therapy, at which point all patients with
at least stable disease (SD) continued either until
they developed PD or until the occurrence of unacceptable side effects with either the same combination regimen28,29 or with cetuximab alone.30,31
In the retrospective study, 68 patients (45%)
patients received BSC, 43 patients (28%) received
chemotherapy, 25 patients (17%) received radiotherapy, and 15 patients (10%) received chemoradiotherapy. In total, therefore, 58 patients received secondline chemotherapy either alone (n 5 43) or in combination with radiotherapy (n 5 15). Of these 58
patients, 13 patients (22%) received single-agent
chemotherapy, mostly methotrexate and gemcitabine, and 45 patients (78%) received combination
chemotherapy (either platinum-based; combined
methotrexate, cisplatin, and bleomycin; or taxanebased). Overall, 40 of 58 patients (69%) received
some form of platinum-based chemotherapy. All
drugs used were available commercially.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint in all the prospective studies
was response to treatment, which was defined as the
best confirmed response. Response was assessed by
using modified World Health Organization (WHO)
criteria and is described briefly as follows: a complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all index lesions (or, for nonindex lesions, no
new lesions); a partial response (PR) was defined as
a reduction 50% in the sum of the products of the
greatest dimensions (SOPD) of index lesions compared with baseline SOPD with no evidence of PD;

2713

SD was defined as no sufficient decrease or increase
in index lesions to qualify for PR or PD, respectively;
and PD was defined as an increase 25% in the
SOPD of index lesions compared with the smallest
SOPD recorded for the study period (global nadir
SOPD) or the appearance of 1 or more new lesion(s)
and/or unequivocal progression of existing nonindex
lesions. PD status at study entry and subsequent tumor response were assessed independently by either
a blinded review committee26–29 or a radiologist.30,31
Secondary endpoints, which varied between the
prospective studies, included overall survival, disease
control rate (percentage of patients with CR,
1 PR 1 SD), time and duration of response, time to
progression (TTP), quality of life, change in Karnofsky performance status (KPS) from baseline, and
symptomatic changes. In the retrospective study,6,7
only 83 of 151 patients (55%) could be evaluated for
response, as because nearly half (45%) received only
BSC; thus, a response could not be expected in these
patients. Consequently, survival was the most reliable
endpoint against which valid and clinically meaningful comparisons can be made.

Pretreatment and On-study Evaluations
Pretreatment screening procedures and on-study
evaluation protocols have been described previously.6,7,27–31 Within each of the prospective studies, adverse events were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria
(NCI-CTC) version 2 and were described by using
the Coding Symbols for a Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms (1995) dictionary. Safety was not analyzed
in the retrospective study.7
Statistical Analyses
The findings reported here represent a descriptive
analysis of data from 3 prospective studies and 1 retrospective study. These data were not subject to any
formal statistical analysis.
Within individual studies, continuous variables
were summarized by using descriptive statistics.
Qualitative variables were summarized by using
counts and percentages. Two-sided confidence intervals were calculated for response and disease control
rates. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used for time-toevent endpoints.32
In the 3 prospective studies,27–31 the primary
population for efficacy and safety analyses was the
intention-to-treat (ITT) population (defined as all
patients enrolled into the study who received cetuximab). Safety analyses were conducted on the ITT
population. Details of statistical analyses are provided in the individual study reports.

RESULTS
The patient and disease characteristics were similar
in the 3 prospective cetuximab studies and were typical of those expected in a population of patients
with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN (Table 3).
The median KPS was 80%, and tumor EGFR expression was detected in 94% to 100% of all tested
patients. Patients in the retrospective study had
patient and disease characteristic profiles similar to
those in the prospective studies. The exception was
the median KPS, which, at 70%, was lower in the retrospective study than in the prospective studies,
although data were available for only 81% of
patients.

Response to Treatment
In total, 278 patients with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN who progressed on platinum-based

therapy subsequently were treated with either cetuximab alone (N 5 103) or in combination with platinum (N 5 175). The efficacy results of the 3
prospective studies with cetuximab are summarized
in Table 4.33 Response rates ranged between 10% and
13%, disease control rates ranged between 46% and
56%, and the median TTP ranged between 2.2
months and 2.8 months. The median survival in the
cetuximab monotherapy study was 5.9 months compared with 6.1 months and 5.2 months in the cetuximab plus cisplatin/carboplatin and cetuximab plus
cisplatin studies, respectively. Thus, the efficacy of
cetuximab therapy clearly was superior to that of the
various treatments used in the retrospective study, in
which the median survival was 3.4 months (3.6
months in patients who received chemotherapy
alone). Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival for all 4
studies are shown in Figure 1. In Figure 2, the survival curve for patients in the retrospective study

SD and PD were each reported in 26% of patients.
In 47% of patients, however, responses were not

Safety and Tolerability
Over all studies reported, cetuximab was tolerated
well either as monotherapy or in combination with
cisplatin or carboplatin. Relevant cetuximab-related
grade 3/4 adverse events that were reported in the
cetuximab studies are summarized in Table 5.27,28,30
There was a low incidence of grade 3/4 side effects,
which included fatigue, fever/chills, nausea and
vomiting, acne-like rash, diarrhea, and infusionrelated reactions. Acne-like rash is observed commonly with EGFR inhibitor use and generally is easy
to manage.34,35 In the 3 studies, there were only 9
reports (3%) of grade 3/4 rash. Infusion-related reactions are characteristic of treatment with monoclonal
antibodies and generally occur with a low incidence
with cetuximab. In the cetuximab monotherapy
study, there was 1 treatment-related death because
of an infusion-related reaction. No cetuximab-related
deaths were reported in the 2 other cetuximab studies. Data from the cetuximab plus platinum studies
suggested that cetuximab most likely did not
increase the side effects associated with the use of
platinum therapy.
The development and/or severity of acne-like
rash has been identified as a predictor of response to
treatment with cetuximab in a range of tumor
types.36 According to the published report from 1 of
the studies in this analysis, there appeared to be a
relation between skin reactions and response in
patients who were receiving cetuximab plus cisplatin.
A higher response rate was observed in patients who
developed grade 1 (13%) or grade 2 and 3 (15%) skin

DISCUSSION
Until relatively recently, there was little evidence
to support the use of second-line chemotherapy
in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic
SCCHN.37,38 Patients who have progressed on cisplatin-containing therapy not only have exhausted the
most active, current, first-line treatment, they also
often are a, or near their limit of chemotherapy tolerability. Consequently, no regimen has been approved
to date for use in patients with recurrent and/
or metastatic SCCHN who fail on platinum-based
therapy. Although experimental second-line chemotherapy with third-generation cytotoxic agents (vinorelbine, docetaxel, or paclitaxel given alone or in
combination) has been investigated in several small
studies, it has not been possible to draw definitive
conclusions on their clinical benefit.8,9,39,40 The dismal outlook for patients with PD was confirmed by
the retrospective study that was included in this
analysis, which showed a median survival of only 3.6
months for patients who received chemotherapy.6,7
The objective of this analysis was to view, within
the limitations of a comparison with retrospectively
gathered data, the results of cetuximab treatment in
the context of what can be expected with commonly

Cetuximab in SCCHN Failing Platinum/Vermorken et al.

used treatment approaches in the clinical setting.
The 4 studies in the analysis generally were matched
well in terms of patient and disease characteristics.
In the 3 cetuximab studies, the use of an independent review committee or radiologist to confirm disease progression before treatment ensured the
selection of patients who had disease that no longer
responded to platinum therapy.
Response rates and disease control rates across
the 3 cetuximab studies were consistent (10%–13%
and 46%–56%, respectively), and the robustness of
these results was underscored by the independent
assessment of response data. Meaningful comparison
of response data between the cetuximab studies and
the retrospective study was precluded by the absence
of response criteria for the retrospective study. A
more representative comparison of the different
treatments can be achieved by comparing survival
data. The median survival of 5.9 months in the
cetuximab monotherapy study was outstanding in
this disease setting and represents an increase in median survival of 2.5 months over patients in the retrospective study who were receiving a variety of
second-line treatments. Of the 151 patients in the
retrospective study, 45% received BSC, reflecting a
possibly less favorable physical condition but, conversely, underscoring the lack of established therapeutic options in this setting. When the results from
the cetuximab monotherapy study were compared
with the more closely matched subset of patients in
the retrospective study (who received chemotherapy
only), there still was a clinically significant increase
of 2.3 months in survival. The cetuximab monotherapy data also indicated a survival benefit of 1.4
months compared with published data from a small
Phase II study with vinorelbine, bleomycin, and
methotrexate as second-line treatment (5.9 months
vs 4.5 months).9 Although the current analysis was
based on information that was available before the
publication of full details for all studies that we
included, the data are consistent with those reported
in the subsequently published reports, confirming
the findings of the analysis.
The median survival achieved with cetuximab
monotherapy was similar to that reported with
cetuximab in combination with platinum therapy
(6.1 months and 5.2 months, respectively),33 suggesting that there is no obvious benefit of a combined
use of platinum plus cetuximab over cetuximab
alone in patients who fail on platinum-based therapy. The usefulness of cetuximab in patients with
recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN who progress on
platinum therapy, based on efficacy findings, is supported by its safety profile. There were no unex-

2717

pected side effects, and the profile of grade 3/4
cetuximab-related adverse events in the cetuximab
monotherapy study was in keeping with what has
been reported for cetuximab in colorectal cancer.41
In addition, adding cetuximab to platinum therapy
did not increase the expected side effects. Skin reactions, particularly an acne-like rash, are observed
commonly with EGFR inhibitors, including both
monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and generally are easy to manage.35 Skin reactions have been suggested as a potential predictive
marker for response to cetuximab, and data from 1
of the studies in the current analysis (combining
cetuximab and cisplatin) confirmed this.30 However,
because we know that patients who do not develop a
rash also can respond to cetuximab, the utility of
skin reactions as a predictive marker requires further
investigation.
In conclusion, this analysis demonstrated that
cetuximab is effective as monotherapy in patients
with recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN who progress on platinum-based therapy and is associated
with a clinically meaningful increase in survival of
2.5 months compared with a retrospective study of
patients who received a variety of second-line therapies. On the basis of the analysis presented, and
recognizing the limitations of comparison with a retrospective study, cetuximab monotherapy can be
considered a real therapeutic option for these
patients with a poor prognosis.
