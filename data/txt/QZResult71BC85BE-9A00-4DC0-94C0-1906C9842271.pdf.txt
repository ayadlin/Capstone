Abstract
Most non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) display elevated expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but response to EGFR kinase inhibitors is predominantly limited to NSCLC harboring
EGFR-activating mutations. These mutations are associated with increased activity of survival pathways,
including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/5. We
report that EGFR-activating mutations also surprisingly lead to decreased ability to activate extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) compared with wild-type EGFR. In NSCLC cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing mutant EGFR, this effect on ERK correlates with decreased EGFR internalization and
reduced phosphorylation of SHP2, a tyrosine phosphatase required for the full activation of ERK. We further show that ERK activation levels affect cellular response to gefitinib. NSCLC cells with EGFR mutation
display reduced gefitinib sensitivity when ERK activation is augmented by expression of constitutively active mutants of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK). Conversely, in a NSCLC cell line expressing wild-type EGFR, gefitinib treatment along with or following MEK inhibition increases death
response compared with treatment with gefitinib alone. Our results show that EGFR-activating mutations
may promote some survival pathways but simultaneously impair others. This multivariate alteration of the
network governing cellular response to gefitinib, which we term “oncogene imbalance,” portends a potentially broader ability to treat gefitinib-resistant NSCLC. Cancer Res; 70(9); 3843–50. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Up to 80% of non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) display
elevated expression of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR; ref. 1), but response to EGFR kinase inhibitors is
predominantly limited to the 10% to 20% of tumors that harbor somatic EGFR-activating mutations (2–6). Consistent
with patient response data, NSCLC cell lines bearing EGFRAuthors' Affiliations: Departments of 1 Biological Engineering and

activating mutations display enhanced sensitivity to gefitinib
and erlotinib in culture (3, 6–8). Studies of these cell lines
show increased basal phosphorylation of EGFR and increased activity of survival-associated signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3/5 (STAT3/5; refs.
3, 7, 9). Exposure of mutant-bearing NSCLC cells to EGF
results in more protracted increases in EGFR phosphorylation than for NSCLC cells expressing wild-type EGFR (3),
consistent with the reduced endocytosis of EGFR mutants
(10, 11). Elevated expression of ERBB3 has been observed
in some gefitinib-sensitive cells, including those lacking
EGFR mutation (7, 12). ERBB3 phosphorylation is apparently
promoted by EGFR in these cells and is the primary mediator
of PI3K/AKT activity (7).
EGFR-activating mutations also perturb gefitinib and
ATP binding and promote receptor inhibition at lower gefitinib concentrations (3, 13, 14). This effect propagates to
multiple signaling pathways and in some cases may involve
differential inhibition of ERBB3. For example, the phosphorylation of AKT and ERBB3 is equally or more responsive to
gefitinib than EGFR phosphorylation in certain gefitinibsensitive cell lines (7). Activating mutations may also result
in signaling after EGFR inhibition that favors apoptosis
over survival (15). Each of these features may partially

explain increased sensitivity to gefitinib of cells with EGFRactivating mutations.
In tumors that are initially responsive to gefitinib or erlotinib, resistance mechanisms may arise that abrogate inhibition of survival signaling. In ∼50% of acquired resistance
cases, a secondary T790M mutation arises that disfavors
the binding of gefitinib to EGFR (14, 16, 17). In other cases,
MET amplification maintains ERBB3/PI3K/AKT activity after
treatment with gefitinib (12). Mutations of BRAF and KRAS
also correlate with primary resistance to gefitinib (18–21).
Because these mutations increase EGFR kinase activity
(22), the finding that the activities of some downstream survival pathways are elevated is not surprising. These alterations apparently lead to cellular dependence on EGFR, or
EGFR “oncogene addiction,” as shown by the finding that
EGFR inhibition or knockdown leads to apoptosis in NSCLC
cells expressing mutant, but not wild-type, EGFR. How elevated survival signaling leads to EGFR dependence, however,
remains poorly understood.
We report that activation of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) is impaired by the expression of EGFR mutants
compared with wild-type. Reduced EGF-elicited activation of
ERK in mutant EGFR-bearing cells correlates with diminished EGFR internalization and reduced phosphorylation of
the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, a positive regulator
of ERK activity (23). Moreover, the effect on SHP2 phosphorylation is linked to defective EGFR internalization. We further show that ERK activity affects cellular sensitivity to
gefitinib. NSCLC cells expressing an EGFR mutant exhibit reduced death response to gefitinib when ERK activation is
augmented by constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK). Conversely, NSCLC cells expressing wild-type EGFR are more sensitive to gefitinib
when cotreated or pretreated with the MEK inhibitor U0126.
Our results suggest that EGFR-activating mutations are associated with enhancement of some survival signals but impairment of others, with the integrated effects influencing cellular
response to gefitinib.

type or K44A dynamin (Dr. Sandra Schmid, Scripps Research
Institute, La Jolla, CA; functionally characterized as described
herein) were cultured as described elsewhere (24, 25). Primary
MEFs and Shp2fl/− MEFs were grown in DMEM. All media
contained 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin,
1 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Shp2fl/− MEFs were cultured in 1 μmol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(4-OHT) for 24 hours to induce Shp2 deletion and returned
to media without 4-OHT for 36 hours before experiments.
Otherwise, cells were plated in six-well dishes and grown
for 24 to 48 hours before serum starving (in media containing 0.1% FBS for 12–16 h) or treatment with inhibitors.
Egfr expression. Wild-type and L858R Egfr cDNA was generated from mRNA isolated from EgfrWT/WT and EgfrL858R/L858R
mouse lines, respectively, and inserted into pMSCV expression vectors with puromycin or hygromycin resistance.
Plasmids were transfected into ecotropic Phoenix cells
(Dr. Gary Nolan, Stanford University, Stanford, CA), and viral
supernatants were used to infect EgfrWT/WT and Shp2fl/− MEFs.
Target cells were selected in 2 μg/mL puromycin or 200 μg/mL
hygromycin.
MEKDD expression. VSV-G pseudotyped retrovirus was
produced by transfecting HEK 293FT cells with pBABEpuro-MEK1DD (26) or pBABEpuro-MEK2DD (27) and the
packaging plasmids pMD-G and pMD-g/p. Virus was harvested 48 and 72 hours after transfection, concentrated by
ultracentrifugation, and used to infect H3255 cells. Target
cells were selected in 2 μg/mL puromycin.
Immunoblotting. Lysates were prepared in a standard
buffer containing detergents, buffer salts, and protease
and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4°C and 13,200 rpm for 10 minutes, and protein
concentration was determined by micro–bicinchoninic acid
assay. Denatured and reduced protein was loaded on 10%
polyacrylamide gels (20 μg per lane) and transferred to
0.2-μm nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in Odyssey
blocking buffer (LI-COR), and all antibodies were used
according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Where
needed, blots were stripped with 0.2 N NaOH.
Antibodies. Antibodies for EGFR, EGFR pY1068, ERK,
ERK pT202/Y204, AKT pS473, SHP2 pY542, SHP2 pY580,
MEK1/2, and MEK1/2 pS217/S221 were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies for human and
mouse Shp2 were purchased from Epitomics and Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody was purchased from
Calbiochem. IR dye–conjugated secondary antibodies were
purchased from Rockland Immunochemicals.
Other reagents. Gefitinib and U0126 were purchased from
WuXi Pharmatech and Promega, respectively. Human EGF and
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) were purchased from
PeproTech. Puromycin, propidium iodide (PI), and 4-OHT were
purchased from Sigma. Hygromycin B was purchased from
Clontech. FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, L-glutamine, geneticin,
and all media were purchased from Invitrogen.
EGFR internalization assay. Rate constants for the
endocytosis of 125I-EGF (ke) were measured as described
previously (28, 29).

EGFR-Activating Mutations Reduce ERK Activity

PI permeability. Cells were plated in six-well dishes,
grown for 24 to 72 hours, and switched to complete media
containing appropriate concentrations of gefitinib, U0126,
and DMSO. After an additional 3 to 6 days, adherent and
floating cells were pooled and resuspended in PBS-PI. Flow
cytometry data were acquired on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur and analyzed using FlowJo.

Results
Previous data show that ERK phosphorylation may be reduced in cells expressing EGFR mutants compared with
counterparts expressing wild-type EGFR (EGFRWT; refs. 3,
30), but subsequent studies have focused mainly on the enhancement of pathways including PI3K/AKT and STAT3/5
(3, 7, 9). To explore the possibility that ERK phosphorylation
is reduced in the context of EGFR-activating mutations relative to EGFRWT, we compared the phosphorylation of EGFR,
ERK, and AKT in the human NSCLC cell lines H1666
(EGFRWT) and H3255 (EGFRL858R) stimulated with 10 ng/mL
EGF for up to 1 hour. We chose H3255 for comparison because it is exquisitely sensitive to gefitinib (3, 7) and because
it carries EGFR L858R , one of the most common NSCLCassociated EGFR mutations (6, 31–33). Western blot analysis
is shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1. As expected,
EGFR phosphorylation, monitored at Y1068, was basally elevated and prolonged in response to EGF in H3255 cells compared with H1666. Consistent with previous observations
(3, 7), the phosphorylation of AKT at S473 was basally elevated in H3255 cells, and AKT phosphorylation actually
decreased in response to EGF. In H1666 cells, AKT phosphorylation increased in response to EGF and returned to baseline levels within 60 minutes. The phosphorylation of ERK at
T202/Y204 was uniformly lower in H3255 cells than in H1666
cells, with lower basal levels and delayed increases in response to EGF.
H1666 and H3255 lysates were also probed for phosphorylation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 at Y542
(Fig. 1). SHP2 is required for complete ERK activation
(23), and its phosphorylation at Y542 is required for its normal activity downstream of several growth factor receptors
(34). SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation was induced in H1666
cells in response to EGF by 5 minutes, but its phosphorylation was not induced in H3255 cells at any time point. Samples were also probed for SHP2 phosphorylation at Y580, a
site of secondary importance for SHP2 regulation (34). An
EGF-inducible band at the appropriate molecular weight
was observed for H1666 cells but not for H3255 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). EGF-induced SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation
was modest in a number of other NSCLC cell lines with
EGFR-activating mutations, including PC9, HCC827, and
H1975 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The mutant-bearing,
PTEN-null cell line H1650 did exhibit inducible SHP2 Y542
phosphorylation. Experiments using MDA-468 cells, which
are PTEN null, with and without PTEN reconstitution,
showed no general effect of PTEN status on SHP2 Y542
phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Figure 1. SHP2 and ERK phosphorylation is reduced, whereas EGFR and
AKT phosphorylation is increased, in H3255 cells compared with
H1666. Cells were treated with 10 ng/mL EGF for up to 1 h, and
lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against
indicated proteins. Images are representative of three sets of biological
replicates. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

To determine how ERK activity affects H3255 sensitivity to
gefitinib, we created H3255 cells expressing constitutively active mutants of MEK, MEK1DD (26), or MEK2DD (27). Interestingly, MEKDD expression slightly decreased basal ERK
phosphorylation below that observed in controls (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Treatment with 1 and 10 μmol/L gefitinib
for 10 minutes, however, resulted in complete inhibition of
ERK phosphorylation in control cells but only partial inhibition in MEKDD-transduced cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting that
both MEKDDs were active. To examine the effect of sustained ERK phosphorylation on H3255 sensitivity to gefitinib,
we measured cell permeability to PI 72 hours after treatment
with gefitinib (Fig. 2B). At 1 μmol/L gefitinib, the fraction of
dead (Fig. 2B) and floating (Supplementary Fig. S4B) cells increased significantly above baseline for control cells but not
for either MEKDD-expressing line. At higher gefitinib concentrations, PI permeability of control cells increased monotonically but remained at approximately baseline levels for
MEKDD-expressing cells. Although proliferation was obviously impeded by gefitinib in MEKDD-expressing cells, significant numbers of those cells remained adherent even at
10 μmol/L gefitinib.
To assess the potential for increasing cellular sensitivity of
NSCLC cells expressing wild-type EGFR to gefitinib through
the manipulation of ERK phosphorylation, we measured the
response of H1666 cells to treatment with gefitinib alone
or in combination with the MEK inhibitor U0126. Thirtyminute exposure of H1666 cells to concentrations of U0126
(≥1 μmol/L) resulted in complete inhibition of ERK phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Treatment of H1666
cells with gefitinib alone (1 or 10 μmol/L) for 5 and 6 days
resulted in little to no increase in the fraction of PI-positive
cells versus treatment with DMSO. Response to 10 μmol/L
U0126 was similarly modest (Fig. 3A and B). When gefitinib
was combined with U0126, PI permeability 5 and 6 days after
treatment increased beyond that observed for treatment with

gefitinib or U0126 alone, especially for 10 μmol/L gefitinib
(Fig. 3A and B). Microscopy revealed a high percentage of
floating cells for combination treatments (Supplementary
Fig. S5B). To attempt to mimic the condition of chronic
low-level ERK phosphorylation encountered in H3255 cells,
H1666 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of
10 μmol/L U0126 for 3 weeks and subsequently treated for
72 hours with DMSO, 1 μmol/L gefitinib, 10 μmol/L U0126,
or 1 μmol/L gefitinib and 10 μmol/L U0126 in combination
(Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S5C). Control cells that had been
maintained in DMSO showed no increase in PI permeability
in response to 1 μmol/L gefitinib alone and only a modest
increase in response to 1 μmol/L gefitinib in combination
with 10 μmol/L U0126. In contrast, for cells that had been
cultured in 10 μmol/L U0126, PI permeability increased >2fold above control for treatment with 1 μmol/L gefitinib and
>5-fold above control for treatment with 1 μmol/L gefitinib
and 10 μmol/L U0126.
We attempted to recapitulate the ERK and SHP2 phosphorylation trends observed in NSCLC lines in primary
MEFs. EgfrWT/WT MEFs expressing similar levels of murine
wild-type and L858R Egfr were stimulated with 10 ng/mL
EGF for up to 1 hour and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 4A
and B; Supplementary Fig. S6A). Phosphorylation of Shp2
Y542 and Erk T202/Y204 was more modest in cells expressing

EgfrL858R than in cells expressing EgfrWT, but the differences
were not as pronounced as in H1666 and H3255 cells. In contrast to what has been observed in NSCLC cells, Akt phosphorylation was not enhanced in cells expressing EgfrL858R
and was actually decreased compared with cells expressing
EgfrWT at 60 minutes (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
The correlation between SHP2 and ERK phosphorylation
levels in NSCLC cells and MEFs expressing EGFRL858R suggests, but does not guarantee, that SHP2 may be less active
in these cells (34). We investigated the functional role of Shp2
in promoting Erk phosphorylation by expressing EgfrWT or
EgfrL858R in Shp2fl/− 3T3-immortalized MEFs and probing
for response to EGF for up to 1 hour (Fig. 4C and D; Supplementary Fig. S7A). Shp2 fl/− MEFs constitutively express
CreER and contain only one intact Shp2 allele, which has a
portion of exon 11 flanked by LoxP recombination sites.
As described in Materials and Methods, treatment of these
cells with 4-OHT results in loss of Shp2 and its product.
For Shp2fl/− cells not treated with 4-OHT (i.e., cells retaining
one functional Shp2 allele), Erk phosphorylation was induced
more gradually (similar to vector-transduced control cells) in
cells expressing EgfrL858R compared with EgfrWT. When this
panel of cells was treated with 4-OHT, induction of Erk phosphorylation was decreased for all three cell types, with the
largest deviations from baseline (without 4-OHT treatment)
observed for cells transduced with vector and EgfrWT. These

EGFR-Activating Mutations Reduce ERK Activity

Figure 4. Compared with expression of EgfrWT, expression of
EgfrL858R in MEFs results in decreased EGF-mediated Shp2 and Erk
phosphorylation and diminished effect of Shp2 deletion on Erk
phosphorylation. EgfrWT/WT primary MEFs (A and B) and Shp2fl/− MEFs
(C and D) transduced with vectors encoding for EgfrWT or EgfrL858R
were stimulated with 10 ng/mL EGF, and lysates were analyzed by

findings suggest that Shp2 plays a more prominent role in
promoting Erk phosphorylation downstream of EgfrWT than
EgfrL858R. Interestingly, Shp2fl/− cells became more responsive
to gefitinib after treatment with 4-OHT (Supplementary
Fig. S7B), suggesting that impairment of Shp2 activity may
promote cellular sensitivity to gefitinib.
Reduced phosphorylation of ERK downstream of EGFRL858R
may be linked to the previously established relationship between EGFR endocytosis and ERK activation (25) given that activating mutations of EGFR are endocytosis impaired (10, 11).
Rate constants for the endocytosis of 125I-EGF (ke) measured
using a well-established technique (28, 29) were previously reported for the NSCLC cell lines A549 (EGFRWT, gefitinib resistant) and PC9 (EGFRdelE746-A750, gefitinib sensitive) as 0.14 and
0.04 minutes−1, respectively (10). Using the same technique, we
measured ke values for H1666 and H3255 of 0.21 and 0.02, respectively (Fig. 5A). We found that this trend was reproduced
in a panel of EgfrWT/WT, EgfrWT/L858R, and EgfrL858R/L858R primary
MEFs, where ke decreased monotonically with increasing
relative abundance of the mutant allele (Fig. 5B). Reductions
in ke relative to control were also observed when EgfrWT and
EgfrL858R were expressed in the EgfrWT/WT background, with
the greatest reduction observed for Egfr L858R expression
(Fig. 5C). These results indicate that both receptor expression
level and mutational status play a role in determining ke. For
Shp2fl/− cells (without 4-OHT treatment), ke for vector control

www.aacrjournals.org

cells was significantly lower than in the EgfrWT/WT background,
but increased Egfr expression resulted in further reduced ke
values, with the lowest observed ke for EgfrL858R expression
(Fig. 5D). No change was observed in the measured ke for
Shp2fl/− cells treated with 4-OHT (Supplementary Fig. S7C).
To determine if SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation depends on
EGFR endocytosis, we investigated SHP2 phosphorylation
in HeLa cells with inducible expression of wild-type and
dominant-negative K44A dynamin (DynWT and DynK44A,
respectively; ref. 25). Dynamin is a GTPase involved in
clathrin-mediated endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases,
and its ectopic expression is induced in the HeLa cells we
used in the absence of tetracycline. DynK44A expression has
been previously shown to reduce rates of EGFR endocytosis
compared with DynWT (25), a phenotype we confirmed with
the 125I-EGF–based assay (Supplementary Fig. S8A). Western
blot analysis of these cells treated with 10 ng/mL EGF for
up to 1 hour is shown in Fig. 6A and B and Supplementary
Fig. S8B. Phosphorylation of EGFR Y1068 was prolonged
(Supplementary Fig. S8B) and that of ERK was impaired
(Fig. 6B) in cells expressing DynK44A compared with DynWT.
Slight reduction in AKT phosphorylation at S473 was also
observed with DynK44A expression (Supplementary Fig. S8B).
DynK44A expression also resulted in reduced SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A), but the effect was more modest than
observed in NSCLC lines. Interestingly, a similar SHP2 Y542
phosphorylation trend was observed after stimulation with

Discussion
Our study shows that the EGFRL858R mutant promotes
ERK activity less effectively than EGFRWT in human NSCLC
cells and MEFs and that this effect is associated with impaired endocytosis of EGFR mutants and concomitant reduction in SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation. Although previous data
support the notion that NSCLC-associated EGFR mutants
may not promote ERK activity as efficiently as wild-type EGFR
(3, 30), this effect had not been pursued. Moreover, although a
connection between EGFR internalization and ERK activation
had been established (25), a link between this effect and the
impairment of mutant EGFR internalization (10, 11) had not
been raised. To the best of our knowledge, our present study
also represents a first report of differences in the role of
SHP2 in promoting ERK activity downstream of wild-type
and mutant EGFR.

downstream of some, but not all, growth factors. For example, Shp2 Y542 phosphorylation has been found to be less
important for mediating Erk activation downstream of Egfr
than downstream of Fgfr or Pdgfr in mouse fibroblasts (34).
Those studies did not explore the effects of receptor expression levels, however, and it has been argued that such effects may alter the occurrence and relevance of SHP2
Y542 phosphorylation in response to EGF (34). In addition
to our finding of differential SHP2 phosphorylation, the
finding that Shp2 deletion in MEFs leads to less relative impairment of EGF-mediated Erk activity downstream of
EgfrL858R than EgfrWT suggests that Shp2 activity may be
less efficiently promoted by EgfrL858R. Thus, ERK activity
may be reduced downstream of mutant EGFR expression
because of defects in receptor trafficking and the functional
role (but possibly not phosphatase activity) of SHP2. Data
from HeLa cells with inducible DynWT or DynK44A expression indicate that EGFR trafficking and SHP2 phosphorylation are linked.
Further studies indicated that, beyond the apparent link to
receptor internalization, the mechanism underlying differential SHP2 involvement is beyond the scope of our investigation. Studies of GAB1 phosphorylation at Y627, a site
involved in the binding and activation of SHP2, revealed
constitutive phosphorylation in H3255 cells compared with
ligand-induced phosphorylation in H1666 cells (Supplementary Fig. S9), suggesting that differential SHP2 involvement
may not result from an inability to complex with GAB1. Still,
another marker of defective SHP2 activity [i.e., impaired phosphorylation of SRC at Y418 (35)] was identified in H3255 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S9).
We note that we were not able to fully recapitulate the differential phosphorylation of SHP2 and ERK observed in H1666
and H3255 cells in the model systems we explored. Whereas
EGF-induced SHP2 Y542 phosphorylation was not detectable
in H3255 cells, Shp2 Y542 phosphorylation increased in response to EGF in EgfrWT/WT cells infected with retroviruses encoding EgfrL858R and HeLa cells expressing DynK44A. Those
increases were more modest, however, than those observed
in EgfrWT/WT cells infected with retroviruses encoding EgfrWT
and HeLa cells expressing DynWT, respectively. Similarly, relative reductions or delays in ERK phosphorylation observed
in these systems with the expression of EgfrL858R or DynK44A
were less substantial than the difference observed between
H1666 and H3255. However, H1666 and H3255 are not isogenic, so differences in the expression of proteins other than
EGFR may affect SHP2 and ERK phosphorylation. Elevated
ERBB3 expression in H3255 (and other gefitinib-sensitive
NSCLC cell lines), for example, may play a role in modulating
SHP2 and ERK phosphorylation dynamics. H1666 cells also
carry an uncommon BRAF mutation (G465V), although the
implication for altered BRAF or ERK activity in H1666 cells
is unclear (36). EGFR expression level can also influence receptor trafficking and signal persistence; we find that EGFR expression in H3255 exceeds that in H1666, in agreement with
reports of relative EGFR copy number in these cell lines (30).

EGFR-Activating Mutations Reduce ERK Activity

Finally, differences in cell background (lung epithelium versus
other types) may also affect the extent to which EGFR mutants
alter SHP2 and ERK phosphorylation.
The failure of MEKDD expression to increase ERK phosphorylation in H3255 cells raises the possibility that additional factors may suppress ERK activity. We explored the
possibility that MEKDD expression might increase the activity of MEK phosphatases by probing for MEK phosphorylation at S217/S221. Because both MEKDD isoforms
have been mutated at these sites, any reduction in total
MEK activity should manifest within the pool of endogenous MEK. We observed no reduction in MEK phosphorylation with MEKDD expression (Supplementary Fig. S10).
Interestingly, recent studies showed that transcript levels
of MKP3, considered a principal ERK phosphatase, increased more in human bronchial epithelial cells expressing the E746-A750 deletion and L858R EGFR mutants
than in those expressing similar levels of wild-type EGFR
(37). Thus, the role of MKP3 in determining ERK activity
in NSCLC cells with or without EGFR mutation should be
explored.
Our findings show an important role for ERK in determining cellular response to gefitinib. The observation that
MEKDD expression reduced the death response of H3255
cells to gefitinib suggests that even low ERK activity may promote resistance to EGFR kinase inhibition. This is consistent
with reports that primary mutations of BRAF and KRAS that
increase ERK activity are associated with gefitinib resistance
(18). That cotreatment of H1666 cells with gefitinib and
U0126 promoted more cell death than treatment with gefitinib alone also suggests a role for ERK activity levels in determining cellular death response to gefitinib. Our finding that
prolonged exposure to U0126 before gefitinib administration
resulted in further enhanced cell death response may suggest
scheduling strategies for the therapeutic combination of
MEK and EGFR inhibitors.
Our results also raise the notion that the effects of EGFRactivating mutations might be most appropriately characterized as “oncogene imbalance” because the ERK pathway

is altered in converse direction to AKT and STAT. This idea
resonates with a proposal holding that EGFR mutant expression results in transient prodeath imbalance of survival
and apoptotic signaling in response to EGFR inhibition (15).
Whereas NSCLC cells expressing EGFR mutants may have
abundant PI3K/AKT and STAT activity, they may be put
into an especially precarious state by simultaneous impairment of ERK because this pathway can consequently be
reduced below critical threshold more easily.
