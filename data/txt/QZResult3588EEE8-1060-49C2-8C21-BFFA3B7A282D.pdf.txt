ABSTRACT
Background: In this study, we established patient-derived tumor cell (PDC)
models using tissues collected from patients with metastatic cancer and assessed
whether these models could be used as a tool for genome-based cancer treatment.
Methods: PDCs were isolated and cultured from malignant effusions including
ascites and pleural fluid. Pathological examination, immunohistochemical analysis,
and genomic profiling were performed to compare the histological and genomic
features of primary tumors, PDCs. An exploratory gene expression profiling assay
was performed to further characterize PDCs.
Results: From January 2012 to May 2013, 176 samples from patients with metastatic
cancer were collected. PDC models were successfully established in 130 (73.6%) samples.
The median time from specimen collection to passage 1 (P1) was 3 weeks (range,
0.5–4 weeks), while that from P1 to P2 was 2.5 weeks (range, 0.5–5 weeks). Sixteen
paired samples of genomic alterations were highly concordant between each primary
tumor and progeny PDCs, with an average variant allele frequency (VAF) correlation of
0.878. We compared genomic profiles of the primary tumor (P0), P1 cells, P2 cells, and
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) derived from P2 cells and found that three samples (P0,
P1, and P2 cells) were highly correlated (0.99–1.00). Moreover, PDXs showed more than
100 variants, with correlations of only 0.6–0.8 for the other samples. Drug responses of
PDCs were reflective of the clinical response to targeted agents in selected patient PDC lines.
Conclusion(s): Our results provided evidence that our PDC model was a promising
model for preclinical experiments and closely resembled the patient tumor genome
and clinical response.

INTRODUCTION

MATERIALS AND METHODS

With rapid advances in molecular oncology, the
availability of preclinical in vitro cell models and in vivo
animal models with specific genomic aberrations is
critical for improved prediction of clinical outcomes in
cancer patients. One of the most widely used preclinical
models is conventional cell lines, such as the NCI-60
panel of cell lines [1]; these cell lines are widely used
in preclinical testing for novel targeted drugs, partially
owing to the low expense and reduced labor associated
with cell culture compared with other preclinical models,
such as animal xenografts. However, recent studies
have shown that accumulation of genetic aberrations in
cancer cell lines occurs with increasing passage number.
These models also lack the heterogeneity of tumors and
do not exhibit a proper microenvironment, highlighting
the limitations of cell-based models [2–5]. Consistent
with this, Johnson et al. demonstrated that in vivo
activities of the cell lines within the NCI-60 panel
did not closely correlate with corresponding human
cancers [6].
Therefore, to better preserve the genomic integrity
and tumor heterogeneity observed in patients, patientderived xenograft (PDX) models are being used
more frequently [7–9]. PDX is generated by directly
transplanting freshly resected patient tumors into
immunocompromised murine hosts with or without an
intermediate in vitro culture step [10]. This PDX model
is an improvement over cell lines because it can provide
both an appropriate tumor microenvironment and
heterogeneity of tumor cells. However, the engraftment
success rates and growth rates of implanted tumors
are highly variable depending on the tumor type,
possibly due to insufficient numbers of hematopoietic
cells and/or ineffective microenvironmental cues in
the mouse stroma [11, 12]. The extent to which tumor
cells from freshly resected tumors are able to withstand
mechanical stresses and xenotransplantation barriers is
also unclear [13]. Furthermore, the use of PDX models
for application in clinical oncology is limited owing to
the time required for PDX establishment (> 4 months)
since most patients with refractory cancer live less than
1 year. Recently, PDC line models have been suggested
as an alternative preclinical model [14] to be used as a
prediction tool for preclinical drug sensitivity.
Therefore, in this study, we aimed to overcome
these potential barriers of pre-existing models by
examining the capacity of PDC line models to
recapitulate the histological and genomic features
of primary patient tumors. In selected cases, we
screened drug sensitivity in vitro using PDC lines and
compared the results with real-life clinical treatment
outcomes.

Patient consent and study inclusion

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Between April 2012 and August 2014, patients with
metastatic cancer were enrolled in the SMC Oncology
Biomarker study (NCT#01831609,http://clinicaltrials.gov).
Briefly, the inclusion criteria were as follows: age ≥ 18
years; pathologically confirmed solid cancer; presence of
metastatic lesion(s) not amenable to surgical treatment and
having malignant effusion in the body cavity which needed
to be drained by percutaneous methods for therapeutic
purpose. Effusions were obtained for therapeutic
purposes after obtaining written informed consent, and
all procedures were carried out according to guidelines
from the Declaration of Helsinki. The Institutional
Review Board at the Samsung Medical Center approved
the protocol. Of the 200 patients who had given written
informed consent, 24 patients retracted their consent during
the course of the study. Thus, the processes described
below were performed for the remaining 176 patients.

Primary cultures of human effusions
Malignant ascites, pleural effusions, or pericardial
effusions were collected from patients with metastatic
cancer. Collected effusions (1–5 L) were divided into
50-mL tubes, centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min, and
washed twice with PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended
in culture medium and plated into 75-cm2 culture flasks.
Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco BRL, Paisley, UK)
and 1% antibiotic-anti-mycotic solution (Gibco BRL).
The medium was changed every 3 days, and cells were
maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.
PDCs were passaged using TrypLE Express (Gibco BRL)
to detach cells when the cells reached 80–90% confluence.

Cryopreservation of PDCs
Cells at 80–90% confluence were washed, detached
using TrypLE Express, and incubated for 3 min at 37°C
with 5% CO2. Following detachment, 4 mL of complete
culture media was added to block trypsin activity, and
cells were transferred to a 15-mL sterile centrifuge tube.
After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 1 mL of
freezing medium (Cellbanker, Zenoaq, Japan), transferred
into cryovials (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL, USA), and
frozen at –80°C overnight.

DNA/RNA extractions
Cultured primary human cells (passage 1 to 4,
Supplementary Table 1) were harvested with TrypLE
Express. Genomic DNA was isolated using a QIAamp

25620

Oncotarget

DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, GmBH, Hilden, Germany),
and total RNA was isolated with an RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
concentrations of genomic DNA and RNA were measured
using a NanoDrop ND-100 (Nano Drop Technologies,
Wilmington, DE, USA). Genomic DNA and RNA were
stored at –80°C.

The sequencing reads were aligned to the human genome
reference sequence (hg19) using BWA-mem (v0.7.5),
SAMTOOLS (v0.1.18), Picard (v1.93), and GATK
(v3.1.1) for sorting SAM/BAM files, duplicate marking,
and local realignment, respectively. Local realignment and
base recalibration were carried out based on dbSNP137,
Mills indels, HapMap, and Omni. SNVs and InDels were
identified using Mutect (v1.1.4) and Pindel (v0.2.4),
respectively. ANNOVAR was used to annotate the
detected variants. Only variants with over 1% of allele
frequency were included in the results. The correlation
coefficient was calculated based on variants that were
detected in both cells.

Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2
We used the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2 (Life
Technologies, USA) to detect common somatic mutations
as previously described [15]. This panel was used to assay
2, 855 mutations in 50 commonly mutated oncogenes
and tumor suppressor genes (Supplementary Table 2).
DNA samples were subjected to single-tube, multiplex
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using the
Ion AmpliSeqCancer Primer Pool and Ion AmpliSeqKit
reagents (Life Technologies). Treatment of the resulting
amplicons with the FuPa Reagent partially digested
the primers and phosphorylated the amplicons. The
phosphorylated amplicons were ligated to Ion Adapters and
purified. For barcoded library preparation, we substituted
barcoded adapters from the Ion Xpress Barcode Adapters
1–96 Kit for the non-barcoded adapter mix supplied in the
Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit. Ligated DNA was subjected
to nick-translation and amplification to complete the
linkage between adapters and amplicons and to generate
a sufficient material for downstream template preparation.
Two rounds of Agencourt AMPure XP Reagent binding
at 0.6 and 1.2 bead-to-sample volume ratios were used to
remove input DNA and unincorporated primers from the
amplicon-containing solution. The final size of the library
molecules was approximately 125–300 bp. We transferred
the libraries to the Ion OneTouch System for automated
template preparation. Sequencing was performed on
an Ion PGM sequencer according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. We used IonTorrent Software for automated
data analysis.
A new pipeline was designed for highly sensitive
identification of Single nucleotide variations (SNVs) for
passages 0, 1, and 2 (P0, P1, and P2, respectively) and
xenografts. Varscan2 SNP calling was performed with the
following options: min-coverage, 50; min-var-freq, 0.01;
and p-value, 0.1. Variants around the insertions/deletions
(InDels) were filtered out [16]. Variants were annotated
using Oncotator [17].

nCounter Copy Number Variation CodeSets
For detection of copy number variations (CNVs),
300 ng of purified genomic DNA extracted from PDCs
was analyzed using nCounter Copy Number Variation
CodeSets. DNA was fragmented by AluI digestion and
denatured at 95°C. Fragmented DNA was hybridized with
the codeset of 86 genes in the nCounter Cancer CN Assay
Kit (Nanostring Technologies, Seattle, WA, USA) for 18 h
at 65°C and processed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. An nCounter Digital Analyzer was used to
detect and tabulate the signals of the reporter probes.
Average count numbers of greater than 3 were called and
confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent in
situ hybridization (FISH), or real-time PCR. Validation of
nCounter results has been published previously [15].

NanoString 522-kinase panel
The nCounter GX Human Kinase Kit (NanoString
Technologies) was used for targeted gene expression
analyses of PDCs. Purified RNA (100 ng) was hybridized
with the available 522 gene code set for 18 h at 65°C and
processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions [18].

PDX models established from PDCs
PDCs were transferred to OncoTest, Germany as
frozen vials. On site, the cells were thawed, the freezing
medium was removed, and the cells were resuspended
and transferred into T75 flasks. Cells were grown for
3–7 days in RPMI/10% FBS until the culture reached
around 80% confluence. Cells were collected and counted,
and 5,106 cells were injected into the hind flanks of NOD
scid gamma (NSG) mice (Jackson Laboratories). Tumors
developed within 25–85 days after injection; these tumors
were explanted, and viable portions of the tumors were
cut into pieces and implanted subcutaneously into female
NMRI nu/nu mice (Harlan Laboratories). This process
was repeated in order to serially passage the respective
models. From each passage, formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) blocks were prepared, and tumor
slices were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

Targeted sequencing
In order to genomically compare PDCs to primary
tumor specimens, we performed targeted deep sequencing
in 16 primary tumor-PDC paired samples. Genomic DNA
was extracted, and a SureSelect customized kit (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used for
capturing 381 cancer-related genes. Illumina HiSeq 2500
was used for sequencing with 100 bp paired-end reads.

two passages. Cells from all patients were stained with
either H&E or Papanicolaou, and micrographs were
prospectively stored in our internal database. The most
common reasons for culture failure were bacterial
contamination (26 cases, 56.5%; Figure 1), followed
by failure of the cells to grow in culture (16 cases,
34.8%); in 4 cases (8.7%), no cells were found in the
collected effusion. Of 130 PDC models, 14 cases that
were inadequate for genomic profiling were excluded.
Therefore, genomic analyses, including Ion Ampliseq,
nCounter CNV Assay, and Nanostring-based targeted
gene expression profiling were performed in 116 cases
(Supplementary Table 1).
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of
the patients (N = 116). The most common cancer type
was GC (N = 58; 50.0%), followed by colorectal cancer
(N = 25; 21.6%) and then hepatocellular carcinoma (N = 8;
6.9%). PDCs were collected most commonly from ascites
(N = 101; 87.1%), followed by pleural effusions (N = 12;
10.3%), pericardial effusion (N = 1; 0.9%), and other
sources (Table 1). The maximum passage number of cells
was 10 (range, 6–14), and passage numbers at the time
of analysis ranged from 1 to 4 (Supplementary Table 1).
All PDCs were grown in flasks as attached monolayers.
Details of growth properties of established PDCs are
described in Supplementary Table 1. With our culture
conditions, the median time between primary tumors and
P2 for this model was 4 weeks (average 28.6 days). In all
cells, the median time from specimen collection to P1 was
3 weeks (range, 0.5–4 weeks), while that for growth from
P1 to P2 was 2.5 weeks (range, 0.5–5 weeks). The median
doubling time was 119.5 h.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was designed to reduce the
potential for false-positive calls from the mutation analysis
by the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2. The variants were
filtered by coverage (>100×), quality score (>30), and
variant frequency of each sample (>1%). We also discarded
germline variants specific to Koreans, such as rs1042522
in TP53 and rs1870377 in KDR. Nonsynonymous and
frame shift mutations were included for further analysis.
We used the MyCancerGenome database (http://www
.mycancergenome.org/) and Therapeutic Target Database
(http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/group/TTD/ttd.asp) to address
clinically actionable mutations.
For expression analysis, high-throughput gene
expression analyses were carried out for TCGA gastric
cancer (GC; N = 307), ACRG (N = 300), and our
PDCs (N = 109) [19, 20]. The TCGA STAD dataset
was analyzed using gene reads per kilobase per million
mapped reads (RPKM) estimated by the TCGA pipeline
with the Illumina GA and HiSeq 2000 platforms. ACRG
was analyzed using the log10-transformed RMA signal
intensity with the Affymetrix Human Genome U133
Plus 2.0 Array. Before integrating multiple datasets, our
PDC gene expression data were normalized by nSolver
and adjusted for removing outliers using the R package
‘outliers’ (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/outliers/
index. html). Next, platform effects of the three datasets
were eliminated by meta-analysis using ComBat [21].
Finally, a gene expression matrix of 485 genes and
716 samples was used for future analysis.
In order to investigate gene expression concordance
in PDCs, we performed correlation analyses between
different cohorts, PCA analysis, sample hierarchical
clustering (Euclidean distance and average method), and
Turkey’s honest significant difference test for interesting
genes and five groups. All future analysis was performed
using R language.

Genomic landscape of the PDCs
Of the 130 PDCs, we successfully obtained
genomic profiling in 116 PDCs. We identified
181 mutations in 50 genes using Ion Ampliseq 2.0;
most of these mutations were nonsynonymous point
mutations. In addition to the point mutations, one
truncation mutation was found in APC, and two and
one frameshift mutations were found in TP53 and VHL,
respectively. The most commonly detected molecular
aberrations were found in HRAS, SMARCB1, STK11,
PTEN, CDKN2A, TP53, MLH1, PIK3CA, BRAF, EGFR,
and KRAS (Figure 2). We used the MyCancerGenome
database (http://www.mycancergenome.org/) and
Therapeutic Target Database (http://bidd.nus.edu.sg/
group/TTD/ttd.asp) to evaluate clinically actionable
mutations. Actionable mutations were identified in 76 of
116 PDCs screened in this study. Using CNV assays, we
identified 16 amplifications in 11 genes: three in MCL1;
two each in BRACA2, MET, and RAS; and one each in
ZNF217, FGFR1, CDKN1A, AURKA, CRKL, CCND1,
and WHSC1L1 (Figure 2).

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
From January 2012 to May 2013, 176 patient
samples were collected for this study, and PDC models
were successfully established in 130 (73.6%) of these
samples. Successful PDCs were defined as those cells that
were cytologically confirmed by a designated pathologist
(M.H. or I.D.) and those that maintained growth following

PDCs were reflective of genomic alterations
in parent tumors and clinical phenotypes in
response to targeted agents

to vemurafenib. The clinical response to vemurafenib
(resistance) and sensitivity of PDCs generated from this
patient correlated very well, with an IC50 of more than
10 μM for vemurafenib. PDC#042 was generated from
the sample collected from a patient with HCC, who was
resistant to sorafenib and had an IC50 for vemurafenib of
more than 2.0 μM. PDC#51 and PCD#74 were generated
from samples collected before sorafenib treatment in
patients with HCC who later showed stable disease after
sorafenib treatment for more than 4 months. The IC50 values
for sorafenib in these two HCC PDCs were below 2.0 μM,
although a larger cohort will be needed to define the cut-off
value for prediction of the actual clinical response.

Next, we evaluated whether PDCs maintained the
genetic and histological features of their parent tumors in
16 pairs of PDCs and primary tumors from synchronous
patients with metastatic cancer. Synchronous samples
were defined as those collected less than 6 months apart
based on the date of the primary tumor procurement. Deep
sequencing of 16 paired samples revealed that genomic
alterations were highly concordant between primary
tumors and the progeny PDCs (Figure 3 and Table 2), with
an average VAF correlation of 0.878.
Next, we examined whether the drug response
profiles of PDCs were reflective of the clinical response
to targeted agents in selected patients who had such
information available. PDC#001 was generated from
the sample collected from a patient with GC who was
sensitive to lapatinib treatment, which was reflected in
the corresponding PDC, with a half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) of 1.1 μM (Table 3). PDC#014
was generated from the sample collected from a patient
with BRAFV600E (+) melanoma, who was resistant

As a proof-of-concept study, we characterized
ascite-derived PDCs from a patient with RAS-amplified
GC. Primary tumor cells and PDCs generated from
ascites maintained histologic features in H&E, CK7,
and CK20 staining (Figure 4A). We implanted these
PDCs in NSG mice to evaluate whether PDCs could
be converted to a PDX model. This PDC-PDX model

BRAF, PDGFA, and ZHX2 were detected in only P0.
A dbSNP (rs55932048) was detected in ZHX2, with a
frequency of 0.6. BRAF harbored an intronic variant
(chr7. hg19:g.140481514A>G) discovered in COSMIC
(stomach = 11, large intestine = 6953), and PDGFA
possessed a missense mutation (p.I670V) in COSMIC
(stomach = 32, large intestine = 26). As presented in
Figure 4E, variants of BRAF and PDGFA had low
allele frequencies (approximately 0.15), making them
difficult to identify. Additionally, when investigating the
position status of BRAF and PDGFA for all samples,
variant allele frequencies seemed to be lower in P2 than
in P0 (Figure 4E). For instance, PDGFA p.I670V, which
was present in P0, was not identified in P2. Moreover,
variants in BRAF and PDGFA were not identified
in PDXs.

exhibited histological features and IHC findings
similar to those of the primary tumor (Figure 4B).
To confirm the genomic features of various tumor
cells, we compared variant allele frequency results of
the primary tumor (P0), P1 cells, P2 cells, and PDXs
derived from P2 cells (Supplementary Table 3). Three
samples (P0, P1, and P2) were highly correlated
(0.99–1), and the numbers of identified variants were
similar (from 20 to 27). PDXs showed many variants
(over 100), and low correlation was observed with the
other samples (0.6–0.8; Figure 4C). All 14 positions
shown in Figure 4D from the intersection of four
samples were known positions of dbSNPs, and the mean
allele frequency was 0.77. The number of intersection
variants from P0 to P2 was 17. CDKN2B, PTEN1, and
SMARCB1 were also included with genes of 14 variants.

Comparison of gene expression between GC
PDC and the TCGA/ACRG cohort

differential expression of four major known oncogenes in
GC, we found that MET (p = 0.00) and ERBB2 (p = 0.00)
were differentially expressed between normal and tumor
tissues (Figure 5E). Taken together, gene expression
profiling of the GC PDC cohort correlated well with the
large genome cohorts TCGA and ACRG.

In order to investigate the relevance of changes in
gene expression in PDCs, we integrated three different
datasets (TCGA GC, Asian Cancer Research Group
[ACRG] GC, and our PDC cohort) [19, 20]. ACRG and
GC PDC samples were from Korean patients, while
samples in the TCGA dataset were collected from
multiple ethnic groups. TCGA was the only dataset to
include normal samples (N = 33). For cross-platform gene
expression comparison, meta-analysis was performed
using the workflow shown in Figure 5A. Between-tumor
cohort similarity was inferred from sample correlations
between different cohorts. Correlation distributions are
shown in Figure 5B. All sample correlations between
cohorts were quite similar. The mean correlation between
ACRG and TCGA was 0.69, while that between ACRG
and PDC GC was 0.73 and that between ACRG and PDC
except GC was 0.7. Heterogeneity of GC was present in
TCGA GC samples (Figure 5C). PDC GC samples were
clustered well with both TCGA GC and ACRG GC cohorts
(Figure 5D). Korean patient samples of ACRG and PDC
GC were centralized in the PDC plot core and seemed to
be less diverse than the TCGA cohort. When investigating

DISCUSSION
Accurate prediction of antitumor efficacy for targeted
agents before clinical trial design and implementation in
patients with metastatic cancer is essential to improve
treatment outcomes. Ideal preclinical models should
closely resemble actual tumors in terms of molecular
profiles and clinical behaviors. In this study, we developed
a PDC model that exhibited histological features, genomic
profiles, and functional behaviors similar to those of real
tumors in patients with metastatic cancer. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a high
success rate of PDC establishment from a large number of
samples from patients with cancer. In addition, we showed
that the most useful source of PDCs was malignant ascites.
The median time from specimen collection to P1 was
3 weeks (range, 0.5–4 weeks), and that from P1 to P2 was
2.5 weeks (range, 0.5–5 weeks). The targeted sequencing

results of paired primary tumor/PDCs were highly
concordant. Thus, these data have important implications
in the development of appropriate model systems for drug
discovery and screening.
We profiled the genomes of 116 PDCs using
next-generation sequencing (NGS), targeted gene
expression profiling, and nCounter CNV assays.
Given the current widespread use of NGS to identify
rare genetic aberrations that can also be targeted with
specific drugs, there is a great need to increase the
availability to preclinical models for genomic profiling.
Several molecules that directly target cancer driver
genes have been shown to have unprecedented activities
in preclinical studies; however, many compounds fall
short of their expectations once tested in clinical trials
[6]. To improve the relevance of preclinical models,
several factors must be considered, including faithful
reproduction of the biological features and clinical
courses of patients’ primary tumors, the ability to rapidly
establish a disease model, affordability, and simplified
handling methods. While conventional cell lines
are convenient and easy to use, they often have poor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

predictive power [22]. Although PDX models retain
important biological properties that are also observed
in primary tumors, these models are time consuming
and difficult to generate [23, 24]. Furthermore, PDX
models are limited by their cost, labor requirements,
and ethical issues concerning research using animals
[25]. Considering these limitations, we attempted to
demonstrate the advantages of our PDC model in this
study. First, we found that PDC models faithfully
recapitulated primary patient tumors, retaining the
molecular and gross phenotypic characteristics of the
primary tumor. Second, the median time from specimen
collection to PDC P1 was only 3 weeks, which is more
feasible for clinical application than PDX models, which
take more than 3–4 months. Third, the success rate was
very high (>70% of attempted cases), and the maximum
passage number was 10. Fourth, although tested in
selected cases only, we demonstrated that PDCs could
be successfully engrafted into immunocompromised
mice; thus, PDCs can be used both in vitro and as a cell
source for further in vivo analyses. The variant calling
allele frequencies of P0–P2 were concordant; however,

PDXs varied more from the primary tumor in terms of
genomics and were less concordant with the primary
tumor when compared with the concordance rates
of P0–P2 cells. Thus, these data supported that PDC
lines may be a valid alternative model to PDXs to
test the efficacy of preclinical compounds for specific
molecular targets. However, more extensive study using
conversion of PDCs to PDXs should be performed to
assess the accurate take-rate of cultured PDCs in animal
models. In addition, direct comparison experiments of
antitumor efficacy of molecularly targeted agents in
PDCs versus PDXs are currently underway.
As an exploratory analysis, we tested whether
the drug response profiles of PDCs were concordant
with the actual clinical responses to targeted agents in
selected cases. Based on our previous work, genomically
characterized PDCs can be used as a useful tool to
demonstrate antitumor efficacy of specific targeted agents,
such as CCNE1-amplified (+) PDCs [26], HER2 (+)
MET (+) GC PDCs [27], and MerTK (+) GC PDCs [28].
In this study, we demonstrated that GC PDCs derived from
a patient with lapatinib-sensitive cancer were sensitive
to lapatinib in vitro. Similarly, PDCs generated from
pleural fluid in a patient with vemurafenib resistance were
resistant to vemurafenib in vitro. We plan to generate more
extensive data integrating genomic, PDC-sensitivity, and
clinical outcome results. This integrative genome/PDC
sensitivity/clinical outcome mapping may greatly enhance
our knowledge to better predict clinical outcomes at the
preclinical stage.
There are several limitations to the current study.
Because PDC models do not reflect all aspects of the
tumor environment, such as the presence of immunocytes
and mesenchymal cells, this model may not reflect the
actual treatment scenario in patients who are treated with
a specific agent [29, 30]. In order to overcome this pitfall,
we are currently modifying the two-dimensional PDC
culture method to three-dimensional organoid cultures,
with or without matrices.
In conclusion, we described a PDC model that
could be applied as a useful tool for the identification
of rational therapeutic strategies to be tested in clinical
trials. This model is expected to aid in the discovery of
additional therapeutic approaches and the identification of
biomarkers in response to therapy.
