ABSTRACT:
The far-upstream element-binding protein-interacting repressor (FIR) is a c-myc
transcriptional suppressor. FIR is alternatively spliced to lack the transcriptional
repression domain within exon 2 (FIRΔexon2) in colorectal cancers. FIR and
FIRΔexon2 form homo- or heterodimers that complex with SAP155. SAP155, a subunit
of the essential splicing factor 3b subcomplex in the spliceosome, is required for
proper P27Kip1 pre-mRNA splicing, and P27Kip1 arrests cells at G1. In contrast,
FIR was co-immunoprecipitated with Ku86 and DNA-PKcs. siRNA against Ku86/Ku70
decreased FIR and P27Kip1 expression, whereas siRNA against FIR decreased Ku86/
XRCC5 and P27Kip1 expression. Thus the mechanical interaction of FIR/FIRΔexon2/
SAP155 bridges c-myc and P27Kip1 expression, potentially integrates cell-cycle
progression and c-myc transcription in cell.
Bleomycin (BLM) is an anticancer agent that introduces DNA breaks. Because
DNA breaks generate the recruitment of Ku86/Ku70 to bind to the broken DNA ends,
the possible involvement of FIR and Ku86/Ku70 interaction in the BLM-induced DNA
damage repair response was investigated in this study. First, BLM treatment reduced
SAP155 expression and increased FIR and FIRΔexon2 mRNA expression as well as
the ratio of FIRΔexon2:FIR in hepatoblastoma cells (HLE and HLF). Second, FIR or
FIRΔexon2 adenovirus vectors (Ad-FIR or Ad-FIRΔexon2) increased Ku86/Ku70
and P27Kip1 expression in vitro. Third, BLM decreased P27Kip1 protein expression,
whereas increased P27Kip1 and γH2AX expression with Ad-FIRΔexon2. Together, the
interaction of FIR/SAP155 modulates FIR splicing and involves in cell-cycle control
or cell fate via P27Kip1 and c-myc in BLM-induced DNA damage pathway. This novel
function of FIR splicing will contribute to clinical studies of cancer management
through elucidating the mechanical interaction of FIR/FIRΔexon2/SAP155 as a
potential target for cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this study was to reveal FIR’s novel
potential role in DNA damage repair pathway by studying
how FIR coordinates, integrates or orchestrates BLMinduced DNA-damage responses. The results we obtained
indicated that FIR and Ku86/Ku70 potentially form
complexes and participate in BLM-induced DNA-damage
repair machinery. The possible interactions of FIR/
FIRΔexon2/SAP155 and Ku86/Ku70/DNA-PKcs may
provide new insight into DNA damage response pathway
of cells. The importance of the FIR/FIRΔexon2/SAP155
interaction is discussed as a novel modulator of c-myc/
cell-cycle checkpoint regulator in cancer development or
future clinical applications [25].

The far-upstream element (FUSE) is a sequence
required for proper transcriptional regulation of the human
c-myc gene [1,2]. FUSE is located 1.5-kb upstream of
the c-myc promoter P1 and is recognized by the FUSEbinding protein (FBP). FBP is a transcription factor that
stimulates c-myc expression through FUSE [2,3]. FBP and
the FUSE-binding protein-interacting repressor (FIR) have
been reported to be a sensor of DNA melting of c-myc
promoter, and regulate c-myc transcription through the
general transcription factor TFIIH [2,4-8]. Yeast twohybrid analysis has demonstrated that FBP binds to FIR,
and FIR represses c-myc transcription by suppressing
the TFIIH/P89/XPB helicase (P89)[4,8]. Cells from
Type B and Type D xeroderma pigmentosum patients
are defective in FIR repression, which suggests that P89
mutations impair c-myc transcriptional regulation by FIR
and contribute to tumor development [5]. Expression of
FIRΔexon2, an FIR splice variant that lacks exon 2, may
promote tumor development by disabling FIR repression
of c-myc [9].
Splicing factor 3b (SF3b) is a subcomplex of the
U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein in the spliceosome
[10]. SAP155 (subunit of SF3b) is required for proper
FIR expression and vice versa, and SAP155 knockdown
or SF3b inhibition disrupts alternative splicing of FIR
pre-mRNA and generates FIRΔexon2 [11]. Therefore,
a complex formation of SAP155 with FIR/FIRΔexon2
disturbs well-established functions of SAP155 and FIR,
serving as a molecular switch for c-myc gene expression
[11]. In cancers, cell-cycle arrest for complete DNA
damage repair is highly inefficient because expression
of the Cip/Kip family is decreased; thus, cell-cycle
progression is accelerated [12,13]. Together, interaction
between FIR/FIRΔexon2 and SAP155 bridges c-myc/
c-Myc expression and cell cycling. Because FIR/
FIRΔexon2/SAP155 interaction connects c-myc and cellcycle regulation by integrating the expression of P89/FIR/
FIRΔexon2 or P27/cdk2/cyclinE [14], FIR potentially
plays some role in DNA-damage responses [14,15].
Bleomycin (BLM) produces much higher levels of DNA
double strand breaks (DSBs) with relatively uniform and
simple DNA ends [16,17]. Single-strand DNA breaks
(SSDs) lead to DSBs that occur in close proximity and
are produced with higher concentrations of BLM [18-20].
DSBs are one of the most severe types of DNA damage
and they promote genomic instability that is lethal to the
cell if left unrepaired [21,22]. Several different DNA repair
pathways combat DSBs, with nonhomologous end joining
(NHEJ) being one of the major pathways in mammalian
cells [21,23]. The core components of mammalian NHEJ
are the catalytic subunit of DNA protein kinase (DNAPKcs), Ku70/Ku80, Artemis, XRCC4, and DNA ligase
IV [21]. End bridging occurs via interactions between
the DNA-PKcs molecules, leading to DSB repair [24].

RESULTS
FIR/FIRΔexon2/SAP155, Ku86/XRCC5, and
DNA-PKcs potentially form a complex.
If FIR plays some role in the DNA-damage
response, FIR potentially forms a complex with DNAdamage repair proteins such as DNA-PKcs or Ku86/
Ku70. Under this hypothesis, we prepared FIR–FLAG,
FIRΔexon2–FLAG or PUF60–FLAG stably expressing
HeLa cells (cancer cells) or 293T cells (non-cancer cells),
and pull-down assays were performed to examine whether
FIR, DNA-PKcs and Ku86 interacted. Consequently,
DNA-PKcs was co-immunoprecipitated in stably
expressing FIR–FLAG, but not in those expressing
FIRΔexon2–FLAG (Figure 1A). Ku86 has been reported
to form a complex with DNA-PKcs/PARP1 to participate
in NHEJ of DNA DSB repair [26]. Indeed, Ku86 was coimmunoprecipitated with FIR from HeLa cells but not
from 293T cells (Figure 1B). Therefore, pull-down assays
indicated that FIR possibly interacts with DNA-PKcs and
Ku86 in Hela cells (Supplementary Table 1; Figure 1C).
Because SAP155 was co-immunoprecipitated with FIR
(Figure 1B) and SAP155 affects proper FIR pre-mRNA
splicing [11], the interaction between SAP155 and DNAPKcs was further investigated. SiRNA against SAP155
significantly suppressed DNA-PKcs and activated c-myc
(Figure 1C). Together, these results indicate that FIR/
SAP155 potentially interacts with Ku86/Ku70/DNA-PKcs
or forms complex at least in HeLa cells.

Total FIRs, SAP155 and Ku86 were upregulated
in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
tissues.
Given FIR/SAP155 forms a complex with Ku86,
their expression levels should be coordinately regulated in
the same direction. Expectedly, FIR, SAP155 (Figure 2A),
and Ku86 (Figure 2B) were significantly upregulated in

excised human HCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancer tissues (Figure 2C). Notably, Ku86 was upregulated
at protein level in HCC [27]. FIR has been reported to
be engaged in cell-cycle regulation through P27Kip1
expression by affecting SAP155 function [14]. These
results indicate that FIR, SAP155, and Ku86 also form
a complex in vivo (in tissues) and disturb DNA-damage
repair in HCC. Therefore, we examined whether altered
FIR expression potentially influenced the expression
levels of DNA repair proteins and BLM-induced DNAdamage repair.

Given that FIR engages in DNA-damage repair,
BLM treatment should affect FIR expression at their
mRNA or protein levels. This study showed that the
expression levels of SAP155 and P27Kip1 decreased
whereas that of γH2AX drastically increased after BLM
treatment in dose-dependent manner (Figures 5A, arrows).
More importantly, dose-dependent BLM treatment
drastically increased FIR and FIRΔexon2 mRNA
expression, as well as the ratio of FIRΔexon2:FIR mRNAs
in HLE and HLF (Figures 5B). These results strongly
suggest that BLM inhibited SAP155 or FIR function or

Altered FIR/FIRΔexon2 expression changes DNAdamage repair protein Ku86 and vice versa.
siRNA against Ku86/Ku70 decreased FIR
expression in HCT116 cells (Figure 3A, arrows).
Additionally, total FIR expression was significantly
suppressed by siRNA against Ku86 in HCT116, HepG2,
and HLE cell lines (Figure 3B, arrows). Further, P27Kip1
was significantly suppressed by siRNA against Ku86
(Figure 3C, arrows). Moreover, both Ku86 and P27Kip1
were significantly suppressed by siRNA against FIR, and
P27Kip1 was significantly suppressed by BLM-treatment
alone (Figure 3D, arrows). Together, siRNA against Ku86
decreased FIR and P27Kip1, whereas siRNA against FIR
decreased Ku86 and P27Kip1 protein expression. Note
that P27* is an alternative splicing variant of authentic
P27Kip1 [28], and P27* was also observed with siFIR
(Figure 3D, arrowheads). These results indicated that
FIR potentially interacts with Ku86, directly or indirectly,
hence modifies P27Kip1 expression in cell-cycle control.
BLM induced apoptosis in HeLa, HLE, and HLF cells at a
concentration of 30μg/ml (Figures 4A, B). BLM treatment
decreased Ku86/Ku70 and P27Kip1 proteins, whereas it
increased γH2AX and cyclinE proteins (Figure 4C, Figure
5A, Figure 6D). Total FIR expression was suppressed by
Ku86 siRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4D,
arrows). These results indicated that sustained Ku86/Ku70
expression requires at least partly for FIR expression,
accordingly FIR potentially has direct or indirect roles in
DNA-damage repair. Furthermore, SAP155 expression
was not significantly affected by siRNA against Ku86
(Figure 3A, Figure 4D). Thus, the effects on P27Kip1
and FIR expression were not directly related to Ku86
expression level, indicating that the mechanical or physical
interaction of the SAP155/FIR/FIRΔexon2 complex may
be essential for sustained expression of both Ku86 and
P27Kip1.

mechanical interaction of FIR/SAP155 that is important
for both P27Kip1 and FIR pre-mRNA splicing [11]. Since
the extent of DNA damage is critical to cell fate, FIR,
Ku86 and P27Kip1 should be coordinately regulated in
response to the DNA damage pathway.

and HLF cells (Figure 6B, arrows). Thus, the alteration
of the FIR:FIRΔexon2 ratio was influenced as DNAdamage repair response. Note Ad-FIRΔexon2 did not

C). Prominently, co-treated with BLM, Ad-FIRΔexon2
drastically suppressed Ku86/XRCC5 but increased
P27Kip1 expression, and thus enhanced BLM-induced
γH2AX expression (Figure 6D, arrows). These results
also supported that altered P27Kip1 and Ku86 expression
by FIRΔexon2 was related to mechanistic interaction
among FIR/FIRΔexon2/SAP155 rather than simply an
ectopic effect of FIRΔexon2 overexpression. Because
FIR sustained Ku86 and vice versa, our results strongly
suggest that alteration of the ratio FIR:FIRΔexon2 engages

damage. Actually, Ad-FIR or Ad-FIRΔexon2 enhanced
BLM-induced DNA damage by potentially interfering
with Ku86/Ku70 (Figure 7A, compare lanes 4 and 5 to
3; Figure 7B, compare lanes 3 and 4 to 2, arrows). BLMinduced DNA damage affects the mechanical interaction
of FIR/FIRΔexon2/SAP155 and monitors P27Kip1
expression for the evaluation of the extent of DNA damage
(Figure 7C).

BLM induces FIR in Mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs) cells from wild-type control mice but not
from FIR-hetero knockout mice.

FIR/FIRΔexon2 engages in BLM-induced DNA
damage repair by interfering with Ku86/Ku70
and P27Kip1 expression.

If FIR is important for DNA-damage repair pathway,
bleomycin-treatment should affect FIR expression. To
examine this hypothesis, MEFs were prepared from FIR
hetero-knockout mice (Supplementary Figure 1) and
littermate control mice and treated with BLM. BLM
increased FIR in the MEFs from wild-type C57BL/6
mice (W3) but not in those from FIR-hetero knockout
C57BL/6 mice (H1) (Figure 8A, arrows). These results
support that BLM activates transcription of FIR as well as
its alternative splicing (Figure 5B). BLM-treatment (100
µg/mL for 48h) apparently increased γH2AX, a marker of
DNA damage (Figure 8B) and increased the expression
of FIR and HP1α (Figure 8C). Moreover Ad-FIRΔexon2
significantly enhanced BLM-induced DNA damage
indicated by γH2AX and P27Kip1 expression (Figure 8D),
coincide with the result stated above (Figure 6D).

Conversely, we examined whether Ad-FIRΔexon2
affects the ratio of FIRΔexon2:FIR, Ku86/Ku70, or
P27Kip1 expression altered by BLM-induced DNA
damage in HLE and HLF cells. P27Kip1 was significantly
suppressed by BLM treatment (Figures 7A, B), and this
suppression was rescued by Ad-FIRΔexon2 (Figure 7A,
lanes 4, lanes 10 and 11; Figure 7B, lanes 3 and 4). BLM
increased expression of γH2AX, a DNA-damage marker,
and this expression was significantly increased further
by Ad-FIRΔexon2 rather than by Ad-FIR (Figure 7A,
B compare arrows). Ku86 and P27Kip1 were sustained
their expression by Ad-FIR or Ad-FIRΔexon2 (Figure 7A,
lanes 6 and 7). Together, these results indicate that FIR and
FIRΔexon2 monitors or act as a molecular sensor of DNA-

If mechanical or physical interaction between
SAP155 and FIR is critical for cell survival against DNA
damage, SAP155/FIR should interact with DNA-damage
repair proteins. To examine the hypothetical network
of nuclear protein pathways activated in DNA damage
respose, nuclear proteins were extracted from HLE and
HLF cells. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed and
identified by in-gel tryptic digestion followed by liquid
chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (GeLC–MS)
[35]. A total of 199 (53+146) and 419 (273+146) proteins
were identified in HLE and HLF cell. 146 proteins were
identified in both cells. 75 (19+56) and 148 (92+56)
proteins were identified in HLE and HLF cell respectively,
in the case of the restricting localization to nucleus. 56
proteins which were identified in both HLE and HLF cell
nucleus (Supplementary Figure2A) were further analyzed
for potential protein interaction network with transcription
factors, including c-myc, HNF4-alpha, p53, and FKHR.
Ku86/Ku70 forms a putative protein network controlled by
c-myc (Supplementary Figure 2B). Proteins marked with
red circles in Supplementary Figure 2B were identified
in this study. These results indicated that DDX17, c-myc,
and Ku70/86 were hypothetical SAP155/FIR-interacting
proteins (Supplementary Table1).

DISCUSSION
The present study indicated that the nuclear signaling
of BLM-induced DNA-damage repair was transferred
to the FIR/FIRΔexon2/SAP155 complex formation to
regulate c-myc and p27Kip1 expression (Figure 10):
(1) FIR/FIRΔexon2 potentially formed a complex with
Ku86/Ku70, and both FIR/FIRΔexon2 and Ku86 were
upregulated in human HCC tissues; (2) knockdown of
FIR/FIRΔexon2 by siRNA decreased Ku86/Ku70 and
vice versa; (3) BLM treatment significantly increased
the expression of FIR and FIRΔexon2 mRNA, and AdFIRΔexon2 increased c-myc, Ku86, and P27Kip1 in HCC
cells; (4) Ad-FIR/Ad-FIRΔexon2 delayed or increased
BLM-induced DNA-damage repair by interfering with
Ku86/Ku70 and, thus, increased P27Kip1 arrest of the
cell cycle in HCC cells; and (5) FIR/FIRΔexon2/SAP155
formed a complex and disturbed c-myc regulation and P27
pre-mRNA splicing. In addition, BLM decreased P27Kip1;
however, BLM and Ad-FIRΔexon2 co-treatment increased
P27Kip1 protein expression. Co-treatment also increased
γH2AX expression compared with BLM treatment alone,
indicating that FIR/FIRΔexon2 adenovirus infection
delayed BLM-induced DNA-damage repair by, at least in
part, disturbing P27Kip1 pre-mRNA splicing (Figure 10).
The physical association of FIR, FIRΔexon2, and

Ku86/Ku70, FIR, and PARP-1 protein
expression is significantly decreased in cells with
chromosomal instability (CIN) compared to those
with microsatellite instability (MIN).
Eight human colorectal cancer cell lines and a
human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) were characterized
for CIN, MIN status according to previous publications
[29-34]. The expression of Ku86/Ku70, FIR, and PARP-1
was significantly decreased in CIN (HeLa, HT29, CaCO2,
SW480, and SW837) cells compared with MIN (RKO,
SW48, HCT116, and DLD1) cells (Figure 9). This result
strongly supports the hypothesis that FIR expression is
related to chromosomal instability due to its DNA-repair
function. In summary, FIR/SAP155 complex accumulates
at the break ends of BLM-induced DNA-damage sites,
then alters c-myc and p27Kip1 expression (Figure 10).

SAP155; the antagonized effects of FIR and FIRΔexon2
on c-myc transcription because FIRΔexon2 compete with
FIR for FUSE binding site at c-myc promoter [11]. Further,
the effects of SAP155/FIR/ FIRΔexon2 on the expression
of P27, cdk2/cyclinE, and P89 provided novel information
on a regulatory circuit that is important for cell growth and
cancer progression [14]. Accordingly, FIR/FIRΔexon2/
SAP155 complex formation potently disturbs alternative
splicing of FIR pre-mRNA, and thus is a novel, bona
fide molecular switch for c-myc gene expression [14]. In
BLM-treatment, the increase of FIR/FIRΔexon2 mRNA
and the ratio of FIRΔexon2:FIR was not correspond with
that of total FIR protein in HLE and HLF cells (Figure 5).
How should we explain this phenomenon? One possible
reason is the time-lag of stability between FIR/FIRΔexon2
mRNA and total FIR protein. The other reason is due to
the unveiled degradation pathway of total FIR protein.
FIR potentially interacts with poly-ubiquitin ligase FBW7
(F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7) (unpublished
data). FBW7 has been characterized as an onco-suppressor
protein in human cancers [36]. Further study is required
to reveal the stability and degradation pathway of total
FIR proteins. Ku86, the 86-kDa subunit of Ku encoded
by human XRCC5, is a critical factor in the NHEJ DNA
repair pathway [37]. Ku86 is overexpressed in HCC tissues
and anti-Ku86/Ku70 autoantibodies in patient serum are a
candidate biomarker for detecting early-stage hepatitis C
virus-related HCC [27,38]. Previous studies also suggested
that Ku86 variants may play a role in determining HCC
susceptibility [39]. Ku86/Ku70 coimmunoprecipitated
with PARP-1 [40] whereas PARP-1 and DNA-PKcs were
identified by GeLC-MS as potent FIR-binding proteins
(Supplementary Table 1). These results suggest that FIR
has some direct or indirect roles in DNA-damage repair
with Ku86. FIR/FIRΔexon2 adenovirus vectors increased
expression of the DNA repair proteins Ku86/Ku70 and the
cell-cycle regulator protein P27Kip1 (Figures 6 and 7).
Genetic instability include two major categories,
one is microsatellite instability (MIN) which involves
subtle changes in DNA sequences (faulty DNA repair),
and the other is chromosomal instability (CIN) which is
characterized by gains and losses of whole or parts of
chromosomes and CIN is considered a driving force for
tumorigenesis [30,41]. Single-stranded or double-stranded
DNA breaks increase the susceptibility of chromosomal
gross structural alterations which lead to CIN [30]. CIN
is closely associated with intrinsic multidrug resistance of
cancers [31]. In our study, FIR, Ku86/Ku70 and PARP1 were significantly decreased in CIN cells compared
with MIN cells (Figure 9). This result strongly supports
the notion that FIR expression is closely related to
chromosomal instability through engaging in DNA-repair
mechanism.
SAP155 is associated with cyclinE and is efficiently
phosphorylated in vitro by cyclinE–cdk2, a critical
regulator of cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phases,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggesting a possible link between pre-mRNA splicing
and cell-cycle progression in mammalian cells [42]. It
has been demonstrated that SAP155 serves as a substrate
for cyclinE–cdk2 in vitro and that its phosphorylation in
the cyclinE complex can be inhibited by the cdk-specific
inhibitor p21 [43,44]. Overexpression of p21 inhibits
proliferation in mammalian cells and has been found to
inhibit all cyclin–CDK complexes. Similar to p21, p27
inhibits cyclin–CDK complexes in G0/G1 [45].
This study indicated that the FIR/FIRΔexon2/
SAP155 complex or mechanical interaction of these
proteins is involved in DNA-damage repair pathway.
The interactions of FIR/FIRΔexon2 and Ku86/Ku70
may provide new insight into the potential function of
FIR/FIRΔexon2 in BLM-induced DNA-damage repair.
This novel function of alternative splicing of FIR will
contribute to further clinical studies for cancer treatment
[46].
In summary, FIR/SAP155 complex accumulates
at the break ends of BLM-induced DNA-damage sites,
then alters c-myc and p27Kip1 expression (Figure 10).
Altogether, our study indicated that the alternative splicing
of FIR coordinates c-myc, P27Kip1/cyclinE and Ku86/
XRCC5 expression and thus FIR is a novel bona fide
molecular sensor for DNA damage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human tissues and cancer cell lines
Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues
from 15 patients were obtained at the occasions of tumor
resection in the Department of General Surgery, Chiba
University Hospital, Chiba, Japan. The clinical features
of these 15 cases are summarized in Table 1. Written
informed consent was obtained from each patient before
surgery. All excised tissues were immediately placed in
liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until analysis. Human
hepatoblastoma cell lines (HLE, HLF, HepG2), human
cervical cancer cell line HeLa, human colorectal cancer
cell lines (HCT116, HT29, Caco2, SW480, SW837,
RKO, SW48, DLD1) and human kidney embryonic
cell line 293T cells were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and stored in liquid
nitrogen until use. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
cell lines were prepared from FIR hetero-knockout
C57BL/6 mice (H1) and littermate control wild-type
C57BL/6 mice (W3) (Supplementary Figure 1), then were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS; Invitrogen,
Tokyo, Japan) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. HLE
and HLF cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS. HepG2 cells were cultured in Iscove’s
Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM) supplemented

with 10% FBS. Remaining cell lines were cultured in
IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–
streptomycin. Cells were grown at 37°C in a 5%-CO2
incubator.

adenovirus

vector

Recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing fulllength FIR proteins were constructed by homologous
recombination in Escherichia coli using the AdEasy
XL system (Stratagene). Preparation of the FIR and
FIRΔexon2 adenovirus vectors were as previously
described [11].

Western blotting and antibodies
Culture medium was removed, and the cells were
washed twice with cold (4°C) PBS, lysed with 1:20
β-mercaptoethanol and 2X sample buffer, and incubated
at 100°C for 5 min. Whole-cell lysates were assayed for
protein content (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and 10
μg of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5%
or 10%–20% XV PANTERA gels and transferred onto
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes using a tank transfer
apparatus. The membranes were blocked with 0.5% skim
milk in PBS overnight at 4°C. Antigens on the membranes
were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence detection
reagents (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK).
Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 1
h at room temperature, followed by three 10-min washes
with 1XPBS/0.01% Tween 20. Membranes were then
incubated with commercial secondary antibodies, followed
by three 15-min washes with 1XPBS/0.01% Tween 20.
The primary mouse monoclonal antibody against FIR
C-terminus (Total FIRs 6B4) was prepared by Dr Nozaki
[47] and preparation detail was described previously [11].
Details of other antibodies used in this study are listed in
Supplementary Table 2.

Bleomycin (BLM) treatment
The DNA-damaging agent, bleomycin sulfate
powder from Streptomyces verticillus, was purchased
from Sigma–Aldrich (Tokyo, Japan; Lot no.BCBG6499V;
PCode, 101203713), dissolved in distilled H2O at a
concentration of 5 mg/ml, and stored at −20°C. HLE,
HLF, HeLa, MEFs (H1 and W3) cells were seeded in
6-well plates at a density of 1–4 × 106 cells/well in 2 ml of
culture medium. The cells were incubated at 37°C/5% CO2
until confluence (approximately 24h). Immediately before
drug treatment, the incubation medium was removed and
replaced with fresh culture medium. Cells were treated
with 1, 10, 30, 100 and 200μg/ml of BLM and/or 5 MOI
(1.88 × 108 VP/ml), 10 MOI (3.761 × 109 VP/ml), 20 MOI
(7.52 × 109 VP/ml), 50 MOI (1.88 × 109 VP/ml) of AdGFP, Ad-FIR, Ad-FIRΔexon2.

Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR

Stable transfection
Total RNA was extracted from cancer cells, organs
and peripheral blood of sacrificed MEF wild-type or
FIR hetero-knockout mice using QIAgene Miniprep
Kit or PAXgene Blood RNA Kit (Qiagene, Tokyo,
Japan). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using a
First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-PCR (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany). FIR cDNA was amplified using
the cDNA as a template and the following forward and
reverse primer pair: ATGGGCTTTGGAGATCCTCT
and GTCCAATGTTGCTGGGTCTT, respectively.
LightCyclerTM software version 3.3 (Roche) was used for
real-time RT-PCR analysis. Reagents and PCR conditions
were according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as
described previously [25].

Cells were transfected with plasmids using
Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Gibco BRL, MA, USA).
For stable transfection, 5 × 104 cells were transfected
with FIR–FLAG or pcDNA3.1–FIRΔexon2 plasmids [11]
and transferred to 10-cm dishes 48 h after transfection.
The complete medium contained 400 µg/ml geneticin,
10% FBS, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin in IMDM.
The complete medium was replaced every 4 days until
geneticin-resistant colonies appeared. At least 30 clones
were screened by immunoblotting and immunostaining
with anti-FLAG and anti-FIR(6B4) antibodies to identify
clones stably expressing FIR–FLAG or with anti-c-myc
antibody to identify c-myc expression in cells stably
expressing FIRΔexon2.

was solubilized in 10 volumes of RIPA buffer (50 mM
Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid
sodium salt, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitor cocktail)
and sonicated twice for 10 s. The nuclear fraction (400
μl) was immunoreacted with anti-Ku86 antibody and antimouse IgG antibody (Supplementary Table 2) conjugated
to Dynabeads (100 μl) at 4°C overnight. The Dynabeads
were then washed five times with RIPA buffer (500 μl)
and eluted with 100 mM glycine (40 μl; pH 2.0; WAKO
Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan) at 4°C for
10 min. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by GeLCMS [29]. Fifty-six proteins were identified as potential
Ku86-binding nuclear proteins in both HLE and HLF
cells (NCBI annotation) (Supplementary Figure 2A).
The highest probability protein network was analyzed
with the protein pathway software MetacoreTM by adding
transcription factors such as c-myc, HNF4-alpha, p53, and
FKHR (Supplementary Figure 2B).

Apoptosis assay
HLE, HLF, and HeLa cells were cultured at a
density of 2 to 5 × 104 cells per well in flat-bottomed, 96well plates for approximately 24 h before drug treatment.
BLM or Ad-FIR/Ad-FIRΔexon2 was added to each
well separately. After 48 h of culture, cell viability was
determined using an APOPercentage Apoptosis AssayTM
Kit (Funakoshi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 100 μl of 0.4%
gelatin was added to each well and allowed to settle for
at least 10 min. Wells were seeded with 2–5 × 104 cells
in 200 μl of culture medium. The cells were incubated at
37°C/5% CO2 until confluence (approximately 24 h). The
incubation medium and gelatin were removed, the cells
were rinsed with fresh medium, 100 μl of fresh culture
medium containing 5 μl of APOPercentage Dye and the
apoptotic inducer/inhibitor was added to the center of each
well, and the incubation was continued for 30 min. The
culture medium/dye mixture was removed with a syringe,
and the cells were gently washed twice with 200 μl of
PBS/well. The cells were immediately observed under an
inverted microscope, and at least three photomicrographs
of a representative area of each well were obtained.

MEFs of FIR hetero-knockout mice
FIR hetero-knockout [FBP interacting repressor
(Puf60) floxed] mice were established, registered, and
made available at the National Institute of Biomedical
Innovation (http://animal.nibio.go.jp/j_fir.html) and the
experimental animal division of the RIKEN Bioresource
Center, Japan (RBRC No. RBRC05542; http://www2.brc.
riken.jp/lab/animal/search.php). Briefly, two loxP sites
were inserted upstream of FIR exon 3 and downstream
of exon 5, and a PGK-neo cassette and loxP site were
inserted downstream of exon 5. Conditional FIR-deficient
mice could be generated by crossing with tissue-specific
Cre mice to give Mus musculus C57BL/6-Puf60<tm1>/
CU(Supplementary Figure 1).

siRNAs against FIR, SAP155, Ku86, and Ku70
FIR, SAP155, Ku86, and Ku70 siRNA duplexes
were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. Transient
transfection of siRNAs was performed using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The transfected cells were
cultured for 48 h at 37°C in a CO2 incubator. The target
sequences for the siRNAs are listed in Supplementary
Table 3.

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of the differences in
numerical data were assessed by the the Student’s t-test
and the Wilcoxon test.
