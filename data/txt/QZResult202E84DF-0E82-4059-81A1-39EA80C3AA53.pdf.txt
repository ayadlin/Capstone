Abstract
Signaling through the type 1 insulin-like growth factor
receptor (IGF-1R) occurs in many human cancers, including
childhood sarcomas. As a consequence, targeting the IGF-1R
has become a focus for cancer drug development. We
examined the antitumor activity of CP-751,871, a human
antibody that blocks IGF-1R ligand binding, alone and in
combination with rapamycin against sarcoma cell lines
in vitro and xenograft models in vivo. In Ewing sarcoma
(EWS) cell lines, CP751,871 inhibited growth poorly (<50%),
but prevented rapamycin-induced hyperphosphorylation of
AKT(Ser473) and induced greater than additive apoptosis.
Rapamycin treatment also increased secretion of IGF-1
resulting in phosphorylation of IGF-1R (Tyr1131) that was
blocked by CP751,871. In vivo CP-751,871, rapamycin, or the
combination were evaluated against EWS, osteosarcoma, and
rhabdomyosarcoma xenografts. CP751871 induced significant
growth inhibition [EFS(T/C) >2] in four models. Rapamycin
induced significant growth inhibition [EFS(T/C) >2] in nine
models. Although neither agent given alone caused tumor
regressions, in combination, these agents had greater than
additive activity against 5 of 13 xenografts and induced
complete remissions in one model each of rhabdomyosarcoma
and EWS, and in three of four osteosarcoma models.
CP751,871 caused complete IGF-1R down-regulation, suppression of AKT phosphorylation, and dramatically suppressed
tumor-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in
some sarcoma xenografts. Rapamycin treatment did not
markedly suppress VEGF in tumors and synergized only in
tumor lines where VEGF was dramatically inhibited by
CP751,871. These data suggest a model in which blockade of
IGF-1R suppresses tumor-derived VEGF to a level where
rapamycin can effectively suppress the response in vascular
endothelial cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(19):7662–71]

tumors and offers an important molecular target for developmental therapeutics. For example, the alveolar subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is associated with increased IGF-1R (1). For the
embryonal RMS, the loss of imprinting at the IGF-2 locus may be a
primary genetic event for embryonal RMS (2, 3). IGF-1R is a potent
mediator of autocrine growth in Ewing sarcoma (EWS; refs. 4, 5),
and EWS-FLI1 silencing leads to increased levels of insulin-like
growth factor binding protein 3 gene, a major regulator of IGF-1
(6). Additionally, IGF-1 is a mitogen for osteosarcoma (OS; refs. 7–9),
neuroblastoma (10, 11), brain tumors [including glioblastoma
(12, 13), astrocytoma (14), and medulloblastoma (15)], Wilms
tumor (16), and hepatocellular carcinoma (17).
IGF-1R has become a major focus for cancer therapeutics
development with at least five fully human antibodies in adult
phase I to III clinical trials (18–24). These agents show specificity
for the IGF-1R, although they may also inhibit chimeric receptors
formed through heterodimerization with the insulin receptor. In
preclinical cancer models, antibody-mediated down-regulation of
IGF-1R significantly retards growth of many tumors (25) and
induces regressions when combined with cytotoxic agents (19, 26).
These results are consistent with the significant literature that
implicates IGF-1 signaling in survival of cells exposed to different
cellular stresses (22).
The macrocyclic lactone antibiotic, rapamycin (sirolimus), is a
highly specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR), a conserved serine/threonine kinase. The role of mTOR
Complex 1 (mTORC1) in tumorigenesis and survival has become
apparent (27, 28). Rapamycin inhibits the proliferation of many
tumor cell lines in vitro including cell lines derived from childhood
cancers (29), and shows significant antitumor activity against
syngeneic tumor models (30), and against childhood cancer
xenografts (31). Rapamycin induced significant differences in event
free survival (EFS) distribution in 33 of 44 (75%) solid pediatric
tumor xenografts, showing particular activity against sarcoma and
leukemia models (31).
We have tested the strategy of combining rapamycin with a
human IGF-1 receptor–targeting antibody, CP-751,871, against cell
lines and a comprehensive panel of more advanced stage xenograft
models derived from childhood sarcomas. Rather surprisingly, our
data show that in some sarcoma xenografts, IGF-1R significantly
regulates the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
and its transcription, whereas inhibition of mTORC1 has a minor
effect on the level of VEGF in these sarcomas.

xenografts have been described previously (32, 33). Cell lines were cultured
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.
In vitro growth inhibition studies. For prolonged serum-free experiments, EWS cells were cultured in modified N2E medium (34), and allowed
to attach overnight. On the next day, 1 or 5 Ag/mL of CP-751,871 was added
to the fresh media. After 4 d of incubation, cell viability was assessed by
Alamar Blue staining (Biosource).
Western blotting. Tumor tissue samples were pulverized under liquid
N2, and extracted as described previously (35). Immunoblotting procedures
have been previously reported (35, 36). We used primary antibodies to
h-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6), phospho-rpS6 (Ser235/236),
AKT, phospho-AKT(Ser473), IGF-1R, and pIGF-1R (Tyr1131, Cell Signaling).
Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using SuperSignal Chemiluminiscence substrate (Pierce) and Biomax MR and XAR film (Eastman
Kodak Co.).
ELISA assays. VEGF levels in culture were determined by ELISA as
previously described (36). For determining IGFs and VEGFs in tumor tissue,
tumor sample lysates were prepared from tumor tissue pulverized under

liquid N2. Protein (2 Ag/mL) was used to run ELISA assay according to
manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems).
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was
extracted using TRI Reagent (Ambion) and purified to remove contaminating DNA (DNA free kit, Ambion). Total RNA (1 Ag) was reverse
transcribed with hexamer primers and M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase
(Clontech). Gene expression of human VEGF and GAPDH was quantified on
a Taqman 7900HT Thermal Cycler using Taqman Gene Expression Assays
and Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix with no AmpErase UNG (Applied
Biosystems). Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) singleplex
reactions, final volume of 50 AL per 3 AL cDNA were diluted in RNasefree water, 25 AL Universal Master Mix, and 2.5 AL of 20 Gene Expression
Assay Mix. Amplification conditions were set up to 10 min at 95jC followed
by 40 PCR cycles (15 s at 95jC, 1 min at 60jC). The quantity of cDNA used
in each reaction was normalized to GAPDH and expressed as a ratio of
sample cDNA to GAPDH cDNA.
Immunohistochemical studies. Tumor tissue was immediately fixed in
formalin and processed using standard histologic procedures. Sections were
stained with H&E and immunostained with mouse monoclocal Ki-67 antigen

antigen retrieval. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed on the deparaffinized 4-Am
sections using the Promega Dead End kit (ProMega).
In vivo tumor growth inhibition studies. CB17SC-M scid / female
mice (Taconic Farms) were used to propagate s.c. implanted sarcomas. All
mice were maintained under barrier conditions and experiments were
conducted using protocols and conditions approved by the institutional

animal care and use committee. Tumor volumes (cm3) and tumor responses
were determined as previously described (see Supplemental response
definitions; ref. 37).
Statistical methods. The exact log-rank test, as implemented using Proc
StatXact for SAS, was used to compare EFS distributions between treatment
and control groups and between combinations and respective single-agent
treatment groups. P values were two sided and both unadjusted and
Bonferroni-adjusted P values were presented for multiple comparisons.

Simultaneous Targeting of IGF-1R and mTOR in Sarcomas
Drugs and formulation. Rapamycin was purchased from LC Laboratories, and CP-751,871 was generously provided by Bruce Cohen and James
Christensen (Pfizer, Groton, CT and San Diego, CA). Mice received
rapamycin (5 mg/kg) daily 5 i.p. per week for up to 12 consecutive wk.
CP-751,871 was administered by i.p. injection at 0.5 or 0.25 mg per mouse
twice weekly for up to 4 wk.

Results
In vitro studies with EWS cells. Maximum growth inhibition of
EWS cell lines growing in serum-containing medium was achieved
at 1 Ag/mL CP-751,871, a monoclonal antibody that targets the
human IGF-1R to prevent ligand binding (19). Maximum inhibition
of growth was 50% (ES-1 cells), whereas under these growth
conditions, ES-7 and ES-8 cell lines were essentially resistant to
CP-751,871 (Fig. 1A). Previously, we reported that inhibition of
mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin-induced apoptosis in sarcoma

cells in serum-free medium (34). To determine whether concomitant inhibition of IGF-1R and mTORC1 signaling enhanced cell
death compared with rapamycin alone, EWS cells were grown
under serum-free conditions with or without rapamycin, CP751,871, or with the combination of these agents. Apoptosis was
determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis as
previously described (34). CP-751,871 alone induced apoptosis in
only ES-8 cells, whereas f32% of EW-8 cells were determined to be
apoptotic after 4 days of rapamycin treatment. Combined
treatment with rapamycin and CP-751,871 was supra-additive in
each EWS cell line examined, increasing the nonviable fraction in
all cell lines tested (Supplementary Table S1).
Several studies have shown rapamycin-induced hyperphosphorylation of AKT (Ser473). The putative mechanism is through
inhibition of S6K1, downstream of mTORC1, and relief of the
negative feedback on IRS-1 (36, 38, 39). As shown in Fig. 1B,

rapamycin induced a robust increase in AKT(Ser473) phosphorylation in EWS cells and this was blocked by CP-751,871. Rapamycin
also induced hyperphosphorylation of IGF-1R(Tyr1131), suggesting
receptor activation by ligand. For all Ewing cell lines, rapamycin
significantly increased IGF-1 secreted into the medium, suggesting
that cells compensate for mTORC1 inhibition by inducing this
survival factor (Fig. 1C). CP-751,871 alone increased IGF-1 in ES-1
and ES-2 cell lines only, whereas the combination of CP-751,871
with rapamycin was additive in ES-1, ES-8, and EW-8 lines.
Combined inhibition of IGF-1R and mTORC1 inhibits VEGF.
Combined inhibition of AKT and mTORC1 synergistically suppresses VEGF secretion by RMS and neuroblastoma cells in culture
(36). To determine whether simultaneous blockade of IGF-1R and
mTORC1 could achieve similar effects on VEGF, cells were
incubated for 24 hours under normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1%
O2) without or with CP-751,871, rapamycin, or both agents. At the
end of the incubation period, medium was harvested and VEGF/
106 cells were determined. As shown in Fig. 1D under normoxic
conditions, the combination of inhibitors was essentially additive
in reducing VEGF levels in most EWS and RMS cells, whereas CP751,871 did not enhance the effect of rapamycin in reducing VEGF
levels in ES-7 or Rh36 cells. Similar results were obtained under
hypoxic conditions where the combination significantly reduced
hypoxia-driven increases in levels of VEGF.
In vivo antitumor activity. To determine whether this
combination was therapeutically useful, we examined the antitumor activity of the individual agents and the combination of
CP-751,871 with rapamycin in a series of xenograft models
representing EWS (n = 6; Fig. 2A), OS (n = 4; Fig. 2B), and RMS
(n = 2). A complete summary of results is shown in Supplementary
Table S2. CP-751,871 was administered i.p. twice weekly for a
planned 4 weeks only, whereas rapamycin was administered daily
for 5 days per week for up to 12 consecutive weeks. CP-751,871
administered at 0.5 mg per mouse or 0.25 mg per mouse had
essentially identical antitumor activity (Supplementary Table S2).
Rapamycin, CP-751,871, or the combination had low or intermediate antitumor activity against ES-1, ES-7, or EW-8 xenografts
(Supplementary Table S3). Of note, the combination of rapamycin
and CP-751,871 induced complete regressions (CR) of EW-5
xenografts (18 of 18 CRs; Supplementary Table S2). Kaplan-Meier
EFS estimates and tumor growth curves for the EWS models are
shown in Fig. 2. Against the OS models, CP-751,871 induced
regressions of OS-1, and significantly retarded growth of OS-9 but
was less effective against OS-2 or OS-17 xenografts (Supplementary
Table S2; Fig. 2B). Rapamycin was most active against OS-2 and
OS-17 xenografts. However, the combination induced CR in all
but OS-17 tumors where it significantly inhibited growth over the
12-week period of observation.
Although rapamycin significantly inhibited growth of Rh18 RMS
xenografts, it caused few regressions (2 of 10 CR), whereas the
combination induced CR in 9 of 10 mice (Supplementary Table S2).
The combination had essentially additive activity against Rh30
tumors, but induced no regressions, consistent with the data of Cao
and colleagues (40).
Pharmacodynamic and morphologic studies. Downstream
substrates for IGF-1R [pAKT(Ser473)] and mTORC1 [pS6(Ser235/6)]
were examined in tumor tissues 25 and 169 hours after initiating
therapy with CP-751,871, rapamycin, or the combination. Tumors
were harvested 1 hour after the final dose of rapamycin.
EWS xenografts. Three tumors (ES-1, ES-7, and EW-8) showed
progressive growth, and were considered as failing each therapy

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

(Fig. 3A). Three other EWS models showed some sensitivity to
rapamycin (ES-2 and ES-8) or both agents (EW-5; Fig. 3B). For
example, in the ES-1 model, neither single agent significantly
retarded growth, whereas the combination was somewhat more
effective over the first 7 days of treatment (mean 44% growth
inhibition). For all ES tumors, failure to respond to CP-751,871 was
characterized by a failure to down-regulate IGF-1R, to suppress
pAKT levels, or to completely suppress pS6. In contrast, EW-5
xenografts were growth inhibited (f94% by day 7), and showed
dramatic down-regulation of IGF-1R, decreased pAKT, and
diminished pS6 over this time period.
Synergistic antitumor activity of CP-751,871 combined with
rapamycin in EW-5 was not paralleled by a significant change in
the pharmacodynamic markers over those seen with each
agent individually. Morphologic examination of EW-5 tumors at
169 hours showed a dramatic loss of tumor cells and subtotal
replacement of the tumor implantation bed by adipose tissue. This
was due to both cessation of proliferation (f10-fold decrease of
percentage of Ki67-positive tumor cells), and induction of apoptosis
(as confirmed by TUNEL assay) in combination-treated tumors
(Fig. 3C).
Osteosarcoma xenografts. Compared with either single agent,
the combination of CP-751,871 with rapamycin extended EFS in all
OS tumor models and increased the fraction of mice that were in
CR at week 12 (Supplementary Table S2). CP-751,871 alone induced
regressions of some OS-1 xenografts and retarded the growth of
OS-2 and OS-9 tumors. CP751,871 caused down-regulation of IGF1R in OS-1 and OS-2 models, but suppressed p-AKT in OS-1, OS-2,
and OS-9 tumors, despite failing to down-regulate IGF-1R in the
latter model (Fig. 4). Antibody treatment effectively suppressed
rapamycin-induced hyperphosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) in all
OS models except OS-17.
Similar pharmacodynamic changes in OS-1 tumors were
obtained with the combined treatment with rapamycin and CP751,871, although the combination was more efficacious with 11 of
13 mice being in CR compared with 2 of 20 CP-751,871–treated
mice at the end of the observation period (12 weeks). Similar
pharmacodynamic effects were detected in OS-2 tumors treated
with CP-751,871, although these xenografts progressed during the
first 7 days of treatment. OS-2 tumors treated with the combination
of CP-751,871 and rapamycin regressed, but changes in pharmacodynamic parameters did not distinguish between the effects of
CP-751,871, rapamycin, or the combination treatment (Fig. 4).
However, by immunohistochemical staining, the combination of
CP-751,871 and rapamycin had greater than additive activity in
reducing proliferation in OS-9 xenografts, as determined by Ki-67
staining, (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Therapy-induced changes in tumor-derived VEGF. As shown
in Fig. 1, rapamycin and CP-751,871 each reduced secretion of
VEGF by EWS cells in vitro. To determine whether changes of
tumor-derived VEGF correlated with the antitumor effect of each
agent, alone, or in combination, levels were determined by a
human-specific VEGF ELISA.
EWS xenografts. Drug-induced changes in VEGF are shown for
EWS (Fig. 5A). In contrast to the relatively modest effect measured
in vitro, CP-751,871 significantly and markedly suppressed VEGF
levels within 25 hours in ES-1, EW-5, and EW-8 models (P < 0.002).
Of note, levels of VEGF in control tumors had increased by day 7,
probably reflecting their increase in mass and increased hypoxic
regions within these larger tumors. On day 7 of treatment, levels of
VEGF were significantly decreased from controls in ES-1, EW-5,

and EW-8 xenograft models, with extremely low levels (<10 ng/mL)
detected in EW-5 tumors. In contrast to CP751,871, rapamycin
treatment had a small effect on decreasing VEGF at 25 hours
reaching significance in only ES-2, EW-5, and EW-8 xenografts
(P < 0.05). On day 7, treatment with rapamycin only decreased
VEGF significantly in ES-8 tumors, whereas rapamycin stimulated
tumor-associated VEGF in ES-1 at both examined time points.
Osteosarcoma xenografts. The basal level of tumor-associated
VEGF was low in OS-1, OS-2, and OS-9 tumors, being 31, 0.33, and
51 ng/mg protein, respectively, whereas the basal level of VEGF
associated with OS-17 xenografts was 251 ng/mg protein.
CP751,871 treatment significantly decreased VEGF levels in OS-1
and OS-9 xenografts (P < 0.002), whereas VEGF was not detected in
OS-2 tumors at 25 hours. In contrast, CP751,871 increased VEGF
associated with OS-17 tumors (P = 0.05) at this time point. At
169 hours of treatment, CP751,871 completely suppressed VEGF
in OS-1, OS-2, and OS-9 xenografts, whereas the levels in OS-17
were significantly reduced from that in control tumors (P < 0.0001);
Fig. 5B. Rapamycin treatment did not significantly decrease tumorassociated VEGF levels at 25 or 169 hours in any OS tumor line.

However, at 169 hours, rapamycin treatment was associated with
significantly elevated levels of VEGF in OS-1 (P = 0.036) and OS-17
(P = 0.0001) xenografts. Treatment with the combination of
CP751,871 and rapamycin significantly decreased tumor-associated
VEGF at both time points examined in all models (P < 0.0001)
except OS-17 where the decrease did not reach statistical
significance (P = 0.0503) at the 25-hour determination.
CP-751,871 rapidly suppresses VEGF transcription. To
determine the mechanism by which CP-751,871 suppressed
tumor-derived VEGF, RNA was extracted from control or CP751,871–treated tumors and VEGF transcripts were determined
by quantitative RT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods.
Tumors from the 25-hour time point were used, rather than
169 hours into treatment, as marked tumor regression had
occurred at the latter time. Three CP-751,871 nonresponding
tumors (ES-7, ES-8, and OS-17) and two responding tumors
(EW-5 and OS-1) were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6, decreased
VEGF transcripts determined by RT-PCR paralleled decreased
levels of VEGF determined by ELISA 25 hours after the first
dose of CP-751,871.

Discussion
Panels of childhood cancer xenografts (32) accurately recapitulate the expression profiles of their respective clinical histotypes
(41, 42). Reference to this Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program
Affymetrix database4 revealed that expression of IGF-1R was upregulated in most EWS, OS, and RMS models, as was expression of
either IGF-1 or IGF-2. Relative secretion of IGF-1 or IGF-2 was
confirmed in cell lines using an ELISA, showing that EWS lines
secrete more IGF-1, whereas RMS secrete far higher levels of IGF-2
than IGF-1 (data not shown). However, inhibition of proliferation
for EWS or RMS (data not shown) cells in vitro was relatively
modest when cells were exposed to CP-751,871. Similar results were

reported for another IGF-1R–targeting antibody, SCH717454 (43).
As reported previously (36, 38, 39), rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of AKT(Ser473) in the sarcoma cell lines was studied. In
part, increased activation of AKT is a consequence of IRS-1
stabilization when mTORC1 signaling is attenuated. However,
rapamycin also increased phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and
increased secretion of IGF-1 in EWS cell lines. CP-751,871 blocked
IGF-mediated rescue and enhanced rapamycin-induced apoptosis
in all EWS and RMS cell lines under serum-free conditions. Further,
inhibition of two points in this signaling cascade was found to be
additive in suppressing secretion of VEGF (36). Consistent with
these observations, combining rapamycin and CP-751,871 decreased secretion of VEGF in most EWS cell lines.
The antitumor activity of rapamycin, CP-751,871 and the
combination of agents was tested against 12 sarcoma models

Simultaneous Targeting of IGF-1R and mTOR in Sarcomas

using response criteria developed for the Pediatric Preclinical
Testing Program (supplemental response definitions). As a single
agent CP-751,871 exhibited intermediate activity using EFS
[EFS(T/C) z 2.0] in EW-5, OS-1, and OS-9 xenografts only. For
EWS xenografts, the highest level of IGF-1R was in the most
sensitive line (EW-5; Supplementary Fig. S2); however, there was no
strict correlation between IGF-1R levels and CP-751,871–induced
growth inhibition. CP-751,871 induced similar growth inhibition
against Rh30, Rh18, and OS-17 xenografts [EFS(T/C), 1.4–1.6] that
have quite different receptor levels. Hence, the correlation reported
for sarcoma cell lines determined in vitro (40) seems less robust
in vivo.
The combination of CP-751,871 with rapamycin was supraadditive against EW-5 and OS-9 models. In addition, for OS-1 OS,
the combination induced 10 of 10 CRs, whereas the CP-751,871
alone induced 4 of 9 CRs, and in OS-2, the combination resulted in
partial regression or CR for all tumors compared with progressive
disease in the single-agent groups. CP-751,871 significantly
inhibited Rh18 xenografts [EFS(T/C), 1.6; P = 0.0015]; however,
although the combination inhibited growth similar to that of single
agent rapamycin [EFS(T/C) > 15.5], it induced 9 of 10 CRs

compared with only 2 of 10 for rapamycin alone. For Rh30
xenografts, the combination EFS(T/C) was essentially additive for
the two individual agents, with no tumor regressions. Using
objective response criteria, combining CP-751,871 with rapamycin
clearly increased the objective response rate in EW-5, OS-1, OS-2,
OS-9, and Rh18 xenograft models compared with either monotherapy.
Identifying pharmacodynamic markers of tumor response to
rapalogs has proven to be difficult in clinical trials (44). Specifically,
markers of decreased mTORC1 signaling tend to be inhibited
irrespective of tumor response. We attempted to identify
pharmacodynamic markers in tumor tissue that ‘‘tracked’’ with
the antitumor activity of both single agents and the combination.
The effect of CP-751,871 on down-regulating IGF-1R was highly
tumor specific. Rapid loss of receptor was found for EW-5, OS-1,
and OS-2 xenografts, whereas IGF-1R was not diminished in many
other tumors (ES-7, EW-8, ES-8, and OS-9). However, immunoblotting, as used here, does not distinguish between membraneassociated receptor or internalized receptor that has not been
degraded. Tumors where the combination of CP-751,871 and
rapamycin was highly effective at causing tumor regression (OS-1,

combination. Tumors were harvested 1 h after the last dose of rapamycin, and snap-frozen in liquid N2. Extracts were prepared from tumors and VEGF determined by a
human-specific ELISA as described in Materials and Methods. For each condition (control, CP-751,871, rapamycin, or the combination), six to nine independent
determinations were used at each time point. *, significantly different from controls (P < 0.05). A, EWS xenografts. B, OS xenografts.

Figure 6. VEGF gene expression in control and CP-751,871–treated tumor
xenografts. Total RNA was extracted from the tumors 25 h after administration of
CP-751871, reverse transcribed to cDNA, and further quantified by real-time
RT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods. The quantity of cDNA in each
reaction was normalized to GAPDH and calculated as a ratio of sample cDNA
to GAPDH cDNA. Each column represents an average value for duplicate
determinations from three independent tumors (FSEM). Sample values were
plotted in the histogram as per cent of control tumors (untreated). Control levels

OS-2, OS-9, EW-5, and Rh18) showed complete suppression of pS6
and marked reduction in IGF-1R levels at 169 hours. The role for
pAKT(Ser473) is less clear, as phosphorylation at 169 hours had
returned to control levels in EW-5 and OS-2 tumors, despite these
xenografts regressing on combination treatment. Rapamycin
induced hyperphosphorylation of AKT(Ser473) at 25 and 169 hours
in most tumor models, suggesting that irrespective of continued
treatment with rapamycin that blocked mTORC1 signaling,
mTORC2 signaling remained intact during this period. Notably,
CP-751,871 blocked completely (ES-8, EW-5, OS-1, and OS-9) or
partially (OS-2 and OS-17) rapamycin-induced hyperphosphorylation of AKT(Ser473). However, CP-751,871 also partially blocked
rapamycin-induced pAKT(Ser473) in the ES-1 xenograft line that
was poorly responsive to any therapy [EFS(T/C) < 2.0]. Combination treatment also significantly decreased Ki67 staining in EW-5
and OS-9 xenografts, but increased the frequency of TUNELpositive cells in EW-5 only.
Inhibition of mTORC1 signaling may have direct effect on cell
proliferation and survival, or an indirect effect via inhibition of
HIF-1a, thus reducing tumor-elicited VEGF. Conversely, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling can induce tumor angiogenesis by
regulating VEGF. This regulation occurs at both the mRNA and
protein levels, and its regulation of VEGF mRNA seems to occur by
both HIF-1a–dependent and HIF-1a–independent mechanisms
(45). Rapamycin may also exert direct effect on vascular endothelial
cells, or vascular smooth muscle cells (46, 47). Guba and colleagues
(48) concluded that the antitumor activity of rapamycin was due to
its antiangiogenic activity as rapamycin decreased production of
VEGF and markedly inhibited response of vascular endothelial cells
to stimulation by VEGF. In our study, the pharmacodynamic

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

markers for supra-additive activity for the combination were
significant down-regulation of IGF-1R and complete suppression of
phospho-S6 for up to 169 hours. Most notably, within 25 hours of
administration, CP-751,871 induced a very marked decrease in
VEGF in EW-5, OS-1, OS-2, and OS-9 xenografts, and suppression
of VEGF was maintained at 169 hours. Consistent with decreased
VEGF in tumor tissue, levels of VEGF transcripts were reduced only
in tumors where CP-751,871 suppressed levels of VEGF within
25 hours of treatment. In contrast to treatment with CP-751,871,
rapamycin treatment stimulated tumor-derived VEGF levels above
control tumor levels at 25 hours (ES-1) or 169 hours of treatment
(ES-1, ES-7, and OS-9), and partly antagonized the suppression of
VEGF by CP-751,871 in ES-1, EW-8, and Rh30 xenografts.
Importantly, suppression of tumor-derived VEGF correlated with
marked down-regulation of IGF-1R and decreased pAKT induced
by CP-751,871. Of note, only in these tumors (EW-5, OS-1, OS-2, and
OS-9) was there a marked increase in the frequency of objective
tumor responses and maintained CRs when CP-751,871 was
combined with rapamycin.
Our results suggests that under conditions of tumor growth
in vivo, IGF-1R signaling significantly regulates VEGF production
despite continued evidence of mTORC1 activity (as shown by
maintained phospho-S6). Synergy of the rapamycin-CP-751,871
combination occurred in tumors with low endogenous VEGF
(<13 ng/mg protein; EW-5, Rh18, and OS-2) or where CP-751,871
dramatically decreased VEGF (OS-1 and OS-9). In contrast to
CP-751,871, rapamycin had less effect on tumor-derived VEGF, and
partially antagonized CP-751,871, despite the combination demonstrating synergistic antitumor activity. Thus, suppression of tumorderived VEGF is only part of the mechanism, as CP-751,871 alone
did not cause tumor regressions, except in OS-1 xenografts. This
suggests a model in which one agent (CP-751,871) predominantly
suppresses the ability of tumors to synthesize VEGF, which in itself
is insufficient to completely suppress tumor growth, whereas the
other agent (rapamycin) blocks the response to VEGF in cells of
the vascular compartment. This model predicts that tumors with
the lowest basal levels of VEGF would be the most sensitive to
rapamycin. Indeed, the two most rapamycin-sensitive xenograft
lines, Rh18 and OS-2 [EFS (T/C) >15.5 and >6.6, respectively], had
the lowest basal levels of VEGF, although OS-17 tumors were
somewhat rapamycin-sensitive [EFS (T/C) = 5.5] but had extremely
high VEGF levels. Based on these data, it seems essential to reduce
tumor levels of VEGF to a very low level through inhibiting IGF-1R
for rapamycin to effectively synergize. If this model is correct,
IGF-1R blockade (to reduce VEGF levels) in combination with small
molecule inhibitor of VEGF receptors or bevacizumab, may also be
an effective strategy for treatment of these sarcomas.
