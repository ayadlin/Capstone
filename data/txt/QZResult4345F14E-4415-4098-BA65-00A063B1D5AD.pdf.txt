Abstract
Bioactive compounds from edible plants have limited efficacy in treating advanced
cancers, but they have potential to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs in
a combined treatment. An aqueous extract of berries of Pimenta dioica (Allspice)
shows promise as one such candidate for combination therapy or chemoprevention.
An aqueous extract of Allspice (AAE) was tested against human breast cancer (BrCa)
cells in vitro and in vivo. AAE reduced the viability and clonogenic growth of several
types of BrCa cells (IC50 ≤ 100 μg/ml) with limited toxicity in non-tumorigenic,
quiescent cells (IC50 >200 μg/ml). AAE induced cytotoxicity in BrCa was inconsistent
with apoptosis, but was associated with increased levels of autophagy markers
LC3B and LC3B-positive puncta. Silencing the expression of autophagy related genes
(ATGs) prevented AAE-induced cell death. Further, AAE caused inhibition of Akt/
mTOR signaling, and showed enhanced cytotoxicity when combined with rapamycin, a
chemotherapy drug and an inhibitor of mTOR signaling. Oral administration (gavage)
of AAE into athymic mice implanted with MDA-MB231 tumors inhibited tumor growth
slightly but not significantly (mean decrease ~ 14%, p ≥ 0.20) if mice were gavaged
post-tumor implant. Tumor growth showed a significant delay (38%) in tumor
palpability and growth rate (time to reach tumor volume ≥ 1,000 mm3) when mice
were pre-dosed with AAE for two weeks. Analysis of tumor tissues showed increased
levels of LC3B in AAE treated tumors, indicating elevated autophagic tumor cell death
in vivo in treated mice. These results demonstrate antitumor and chemo-preventive
activity of AAE against BrCa and potential for adjuvant to mTOR inhibition.

Introduction

significantly [2]. For women with metastatic breast cancer,
chemotherapy is usually necessary but is often a palliative
treatment [3].
Most cytotoxic, chemotherapeutic drugs used
against solid tumors induce tumor cell death by one
or more of the three common mechanisms: cell cycle
arrest by inhibiting DNA synthesis, necrotic cell death,
and/or direct apoptosis [4, 5]. Since these drugs also

Breast cancer (BrCa), the most common cancer
among women cancer survivors, is expected to be the
first in incidence in the United States within a decade [1].

cause irreversible cardiac, hepatic, hematopoietic and
neuromuscular damages, their use is often limited as the
salvage therapy or as the last therapeutic option that are
increasingly regarded as palliative rather than curative
intent. Recently, more targeted therapeutics that block
cell survival pathways such as mTOR mediated pathway
have emerged [6]. Although, this class of drugs such as
rapamycin and its derivatives called rapalogs have been
well tolerated, their efficacy is limited [7]. Increasing
the efficacy of this “new” classes of drugs with natural
therapeutics, which generally show limited normal tissue
toxicity, could significantly enhance BrCa therapy. Since
many of the natural products act as chemo preventive
agents by diminishing the aggressiveness of tumor cells,
they may provide ideal adjuvants, or neo adjuvants to
more aggressive tumors.
Inactivation of mTOR activity can suppress cell
growth to reduce energy demand and induces autophagy
for stress adaptation [8]. Autophagy is an evolutionarily
conserved process that cell engulfs cytoplasmic material
within a vacuole and delivers it to the lysosome for
degradation. This process not only eliminates damaged
organelles or misfolded proteins as a quality control
mechanism, but also generates amino acids and small
molecules that are shuttled back for reuse as building
blocks for proteins and nucleic acids. It contributes to
basal cellular and tissue homeostasis, developmental
regulations [9] and further helps cells to cope with
metabolic stress such as nutrition deprivation, hypoxia
or pathogen infection [10]. Autophagy appears to serve
as a prosurvival mechanism under many conditions [11,
12]. However, the finding that defects in the autophagic
machinery accelerate oncogenesis indicated the potential
oncosuppressive role of autophagy. Recent evidence has
pointed out an anti-survival, thus tumor suppressive role of
autophagy [13, 14]. More recent reports suggest autophagy
as a tumor-suppressing mechanism by restricting Rasinduced oncogenesis [15], negatively regulating cancer
invasiveness [16] and suppressing renal tumorigenesis
[17]. However, this mechanism is still unsettled in cancer
therapy as increased, irreversible autophagy may indeed
be a novel mechanism to kill tumor cells. A dietary
compound induced autophagy of tumor cells might help
enhance mTOR inhibitors to accelerate tumor cell killing
and thus herald a novel cancer therapy.
Earlier we reported the identification of the
Aqueous Allspice Extract (AAE) as an anti-cancer
formulation against prostate cancer and identified a potent
novel anti-proliferative compound Ericifolin (Eugenol
5-O-β-galloylglucopyranoside) from AAE that inhibits
transcription of androgen receptor mRNA [18]. An attempt
to extend this finding to breast cancer was undertaken to
identify AAE or Ericifolin as a potential anti-BrCa agent.
Since both prostate and breast cancers are hormone
driven diseases with similar progression pattern (hormone
dependence, hormone independent-progression etc.) we
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

hypothesized that AAE/Ericifolin should inhibit BrCa cell
proliferation and prevent tumor incidence/growth.
In this article, we show potent cytotoxic and antitumor activities of AAE in BrCa cells but the mechanisms
by which tumor cells are killed and tumor growth is halted
are completely different from that observed in prostate
cancer models treated with AAE or Ericifolin. Evidence
is presented to show that the tumor cell death is due to
induction of autophagy and a lack of apoptosis or cell
cycle arrest as a basis of its antitumor activity. Further, we
demonstrate both chemo-preventive and antitumor activity
of orally administered (gavage) AAE in the MDA-MB231
(MB231) BrCa model in athymic mice. Importantly,
these effects, unlike the known drug-induced anticancer
mechanisms, such as cell cycle arrest or apoptosis that we
found in prostate cancer, were driven by autophagy both
in vitro and in vivo BrCa models and further, we show that
Ericifolin has limited activity against BrCa cells.

Results
AAE is cytotoxic to BrCa cells but does not affect
cell cycle
We observed a significant decrease in population of
established BrCa cells (MCF7, SKBR3, MDA-MB231,
T47D and BT474) incubated with AAE over a 72h
period. As shown in Figure 1A, the 50 % inhibition dose
calculated from the MTT assay, varied from 50 μg/ml to
100 μg/ml among the BrCa cell lines tested. AAE induced
cytotoxicity was also dependent on duration of incubation
suggesting a continuous cytotoxicity on susceptible cells
(Figure 1B). As compared to other BrCa cell lines, the
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and
HER2 non-expressing (Triple negative) MB231 cells
showed more sensitivity to AAE. Exposing two nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells (MCF10A and MCF12A) to AAE did not significantly affect
their viability, indicating a lack of cytotoxicity of AAE
in normal breast epithelial cells (Figure 1C, Figure S1A).
Furthermore, viability was unaltered when AAE was
tested on a human lung fibroblast cell line made quiescent
by serum-starvation (Figure 1D).
The ability of AAE to render BrCa cells without
proliferative (clonogenic or colony -forming) potential,
was examined by colony-formation assay. Dosedependent inhibition of colony formation indicated that
AAE significantly diminishes clonogenic potential of
BrCa cells. Colony assays also demonstrated MB231 cells
are more sensitive to AAE than MCF7 cells, with 50 %
inhibition of colony formation at 25μg/ml and 50 µg/ml,
respectively (Figure 1E).
We tested whether AAE induced cytotoxicity is
due to its alteration of cell cycle phase-progression by

significant alteration in mitochondrial depolarization or

we assayed the activation of cell death related caspases
using a caspase 3/7 activity kit. As shown in Figure 2A
& 2B, we were unable to detect significant change in the
levels of active caspase 3/7 in two BrCa cell lines tested,
namely, T47D (ER-positive) and MB231 upon exposure
to AAE up to 72h. Since caspase-mediated apoptosis in
MCF7 cells is mediated by unusual caspase repertoire,

AAE-induced cell death is not associated with
characteristics of apoptotic pathway in BrCa cells
Since apoptosis is the most common type of cell
death induced by antitumor agents, we examined the
characteristics of apoptosis in AAE treated BrCa cells.
To detect early apoptosis, we determined the binding
of EGFP-annexin-V to externalized plasma membrane

AAE-induced cell death is associated with the
activation of the autophagy pathway in BrCa cells

we used T47D and MB231 BrCa cells to test potential
caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway induced by AAE
in BrCa [20]. Further, AAE did not induce the cleavage
of PARP in BrCa cells compared to that induced by
staurosporine [21] (Figure 2C).
DNA fragmentation is a key feature during the
late stages of apoptosis, and is usually detected by
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick-End
Labeling (TUNEL) assay [22]. As shown in Figure 2D
& 2E, fragmented DNA that has been end labeled with
fluorescent nucleotide (appears as green fluorescent nuclei)
was only observed in cultures treated with staurosporine
(1µM) but not in cultures treated with AAE. These data
suggested that AAE-induced cell death is not likely due
to apoptosis.

As described above, AAE-induced cell death was
not linked to either apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, we
investigated whether cytotoxicity was associated with
autophagy. Morphological changes in AAE-treated
MB231 cells observed under a phase-contrast microscope
showed high level of vacuolation after incubating cells
with AAE (75µg/ml, 24h) as compared to untreated cells.
This vacuolation was comparable to that observed in cells
incubated with 50 nM Rapamycin for 24h (Figure 3A).
To corroborate this observation further, we next analyzed
the levels of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light
chain 3B (LC3B), a protein associated with both the size
and numbers of autophagosomes, thus a reliable marker
for detecting autophagy [23]. As shown in Figure 3B,

each, for MCF-7 cells and 0.5 µg/ml for MB231 cells) and/or AAE (100 µg/ml) for 24h. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting for
LC3BII (LC3B) levels, to distinguish between autophagy induction and inhibition of autophagosome turnover.

AAE treatment of both MCF7 and MB231 cell cultures
caused a significant increase in the expression of LC3B.
Immunofluorescence assay to visualize the endogenous
LC3B in AAE treated groups showed significantly
increased LC3B puncta [Figure 3C (i)]. This increase in
number of LC3B containing puncta was significant at two
concentrations of AAE tested [Figure 3C(ii)].
A key step of autophagic process is the formation of
autolysosome. We utilized a selective in situ fluorescencequench assay [24]. MCF7 cells were transfected with
the mCherry-GFP-LC3B plasmid construct which
contains cDNA for LC3B in tandem with red and green
flourescence proteins mCherry and GFP, respectively.
When treated with an autophagy inducing agent, increased
autophagic flux results in localization of LC3B in acidic
autolysosomes that quench GFP. This results in increased
numbers of mCherry-positive autolysosomes. We
observed increased mCherry positive but GFP-negative
puncta in AAE treated BrCa cells (Figure 3D) . In order
to differentiate between increase of autophagic flux and
deficiency in LC3B turnover, we used lysosomal inhibitors
Pepstain-A and E64d to inhibit the downstream lysosomal
degradation of LC3B [25]. Further increase in levels
of LC3B in cells treated with both, AAE and lysosome
inhibitors, indicated significant increase of AAE inducedautophagic flux (Figure 3E).

(p < 0.05) in both BrCa cells tested. The combined
efficacy, termed combination index (CI) caculated using
Compusyn software showed that AAE and rapamycin
work in a synergestic manner (CI < 1) as per the Chou
TC and Talalay P isobologram analysis; (synergism (CI
< 1), additive effect (CI = 1), and antagonism (CI > 1)
[27]. The analysis performed with the tested-concentration
with Fa (effect factor, cytotoxicity percentage) between
(0.5,0.9) means 50 %-90 % cell viability inhibition (Figure
4F). These results suggest autophagy plays a central role
in AAE induced cell death in BrCa cell lines.

AAE down-regulates the activity of AKT-mTOR
signaling pathway
As shown in Figure 4F, AAE synergistically works
with rapamycin resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity in BrCa
cells potentially by increased autophagy. Mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of
signals involved with protein synthesis, cell growth and
metabolism. Rapamycin is a potent mTOR Complex1
(mTORC1) inhibitor [28] and studies have shown
that inhibition of mTORC1 is sufficient for autophagy
induction [8]. Moreover, mTORC1 negatively regulates
autophagy in a transcription-independent manner,
downstream of AKT, where phosphorylated AKT at
Thr308 (pAkt-T308) is needed [29, 30].Therefore, we
examined whether AAE induces autophagy by inhibition
of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. As shown in Figure
5A, incubation with AAE caused significant decrease of
pAkt-T308 in both MCF7 and MB231 cells. This inhibition
was comparable with that caused by treating cells with
SH-5, a synthetic AKT inhibitor [31]. In addition, AAE
almost abolished the phosphorylation of p-AKTSer473,
which is another important sites for the activity of AKT
[32]. Accordingly, mTOR phosphorylation (p-mTOR
Ser2448
) was greatly attenuated by AAE treatment,
comparable to that observed upon treatment with
rapamycin (Figure 5B). In parallel, AAE inhibited the
activity of p70 S6 ribosomal protein and 4EBP1, which
are the downstream effectors of mTOR [33]. These
results are shown as decrease in p70S6 phosphorylation
(Thr389) and increase in p-4EBP1 at Thr37/46 (Figure
5B). Among several proteins downstream of mTORC,
the serine/threonine kinase, Atg1/ULK plays a key role in
the formation of the autophagosome [34]. Recent studies
have shown that mTOR regulates autophagy through
direct phosphorylation of ULK1 and a complex composed
of ULK1, ATG13 and FIP2000 is essential for autophagy
[35, 36]. We measured the ULK1 and ATG13 expression
after AAE treatment. We found marked decrease in the
inactive p-ULK1 (Ser757) in MCF7 cells but no change
in MB231 cells, and an increase in ATG13 in MB231 cells
but no change in MCF7 cells after AAE treatment. These

AAE induced autophagy is rescued by depletion
of ATG 5 or ATG7
To confirm the key role of autophagy in AAEinduced cell death, we investigagted whether inhibition of
autophagy is able to rescue cell death. Given the important
role of autophagy-related-genes (ATGs) in regulating the
autophagy process [26], we transiently silenced two key
ATG genes, ATG7 and ATG5, in MCF7 and MB231 cells
to inhibit autophagy . As shown in Figure 4A & 4B, in
on-target siRNA transfected groups, the AAE induced
cytotoxicity was rescued by 80 % in MCF7 cells and 50 %
in MB231 cells as compared to that of siCTL transfected
group. These observations indicated that inhibiting ATG7
can significantly rescue AAE induced cytotoxicity (p ≤
0.05). Similar results were obtained following the ATG5
downregulation with 35 % and 38 % rescued cell death
in MCF7 and MB231 cells respectively (Figure 4C &
4D). Further, since rapamycin is an established inducer
of autophagy we tested the combination of AAE with
rapamycin to further decrease in viability that is greater
than either agents alone. We treated MCF7 and MB231
cells with several concentrations of AAE (25-75µl/ml)
and rapamycin (10-50nM) separately and in combination
for up to 72h, and cytotoxicity was determined by MTT
assay. As shown in Figure 4E, combination treatment
was significantly more cytotoxic than either agent alone

results suggest that inactivation of AKT/mTOR pathway
by AAE treatment may be responsible for suppression of
survival pathway driven by AKT.

As shown in Figure 6B & 6C, fraction No.174 showed
minimal cytotoxicity in BrCa cells and it was not dose
dependent. In addition, Ericifolin was confirmed to not
induce apoptosis or apoptosis in BrCa cells (Figure 6D).
Lack of activity of Ericifolin on BrCa cells indicated
unique compounds in AAE other than Ericifolin that might
be involved in autophagy driven cytotoxicity.

The biological activity of AAE in BrCa cells is not
due to Ericifolin
Previously we showed AAE exerted its anti-cancer
effect in several prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and
LNCaP tumors in vivo, and identified a compound with
anti-proliferative and anti-androgen receptor functions:
Ericifolin, [Eugenol 5-O-β-(6’-galloylglucopyranoside)],
from AAE [18]. We reported that this is the only cytotoxic
compound identified from AAE against prostate cancer
cells [18]. Using the same HPLC based purification
method [18], we identified 10 fractions with absorption
maxima at 254 nm and tested their cytotoxicity on MCF7
cells. The initial cytotoxicity test shown in Figure 6A
indicated that Ericifolin (peak No.7 active in LNCaP
cells) is not cytotoxic in MCF7 cells. We also tested
highly purified Ericifolin in both MCF7 and MB231
cells, no significant cytotoxicity was found (Figure S2A).
We next tested preparations of Ericifolin independently
purified from a different laboratory (labelled as Fraction
174) with NMR validated structures (Figure S2B & 2C).

AAE inhibits growth of MB231 tumors in athymic

We determined the oral bioavailability of AAE in
vivo by gavage and intraperitoneal injection of AAE and
sampling sera from mice. A group of mice were given
AAE by IP injection of 300mg/kg for a duration of one
to 24h and the total polyphenol contents of sera from
treated mice were determined by Folin’s method [58]. As
shown in Figure S3, the serum polyphenol was highest
at 24h after injection. The bioavailability of AAE by oral
gavage was determined by dosing the mice for 2 weeks
with dose escalation of AAE (100-300mg/kg) yielded
similar levels in sera. The highest serum intake of AAE
(estimated by total polyphenol) was found in 300mg/kg
group, indicating good bioavailability of AAE by oral
gavage. Later, 150mg/kg AAE was given to the mice in

intake of AAE at this concentration was comparable to
that with the highest dose (Figure S3) and further, as a
measure of non-toxic dose, body weight was steadily

female athymic Balb/C mice grafted with a 50:50 mix
of matrigel and MB231 cells (2x 106) on their posterior
flank. Treatment strategy is shown in Table 1. Mice were
randomly assigned to control (group-1) and AAE gavage
groups (group-2).The day after tumor cell injection, mice
in group-2 were gavaged daily with AAE (150mg/kg).
As shown in Figure 7A and Table 1, analysis based on
weekly measurement of tumor volumes, and estimating
the growth time required by the tumors to grow into a
tumor volume of 1,000 mm3 showed some tumor growth
inhibition in AAE-gavaged animals (~14 %) but not
significant. Similarly, there was no significant (p = 0.18)
increase in mean palpable tumor incidence between two
groups. No significant body weight loss was observed
in treatment compared to control group (Figure 7B). In
an independent experiment, we tested the potential of
AAE to prevent tumor incidence or potential delay in
the appearance of palpable tumor (group-3). A group
of athymic mice received 2 weeks of AAE gavage (150
mg/kg, 7days/week) before we injected MB231 cells
and gavage with AAE continued until the termination
of treatment (8 weeks). Tumor growth in group-3 was
significantly reduced compared to group-2 (Figure 7A,
Table1). AAE pre-gavage also delayed the appearance
of palpable tumor (volume of ≥ 40 mm3) (Figure 7C,
Table 1). In group-3, palpable tumor detection occurred
at 7h week after cell injection compared with 6th weeks
from group-2, and 4.5 weeks in control group (Figure 7C,
Table 1). Among the groups where we pretreated the BrCa
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells before injection, we observed a significant decrease
in tumor burden with AAE gavage (Figure 7A, Table
1). As shown in Figure 7C and Table 1, in group-4, the
palpable tumor detection time is 7 weeks (48 days), while
addition with AAE gavage further prolonged the mean
tumor palpable growth to 58 days. None of the animals
in group-5 developed tumors which reached the end-point
to euthanize during the duration of the experiment. The
overall survival curve showed a clear pattern indicating
that AAE gavage, especially in combination with pre-AAE
treatment, yield significant survival benefit in the human
tumor xenografts (Figure 7C & 7D).
To investigate the mechanism of AAE-induced
tumor growth inhibition in vivo, tumor tissues collected
at necropsy were analyzed by western blot for apoptosis
and autophagy (LC3B). Consistent with in vitro findings,
increased LC3B expressions were detected in AAE
gavage/AAE pre-gavage/AAE pretreated cells groups
compared to vehicle control group (Figure 7E). But no
PARP cleavage was detected in either group (Figure 7F).

Discussion
The above results established that AAE has cytotoxic
activities against human BrCa cells in vitro and against
a triple negative BrCa (TNBC) MB231 model in vivo.
Moreover, we demonstrated that AAE induced cell death is
associated with features of autophagy, but not apoptosis, a
common cell death mechanism exerted by most anticancer
drugs, including some diet-derived compounds, such as
curcumin and capsaicin [37, 38]. Our results also suggest
that the induction of autophagy by AAE is related to the
inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling. Most importantly, AAE
was shown to be effective in decreasing the growth of
MB231 tumors by oral administration, and this effect was
even greater when the mice were pretreated with AAE, as

a cancer chemo-preventive agent.
The cytotoxicity and colony forming assays showed
that well-characterized TNBC model, MB231 tumor cells,
exhibit the highest sensitivity to AAE among all BrCa
cells tested. MB231 cells are highly metastatic and faster
growing than luminal type MCF7 cells. However, the cell
cycle studies showed no significant effect of AAE on both

cell types, indicating, the DNA replicating difference does
not weigh in explaining the difference in sensitivity to
AAE. We noticed that MB231 and SKBr3 cells, which are
both ER negative (although differing in ERBB2 expression
levels), respond to AAE better than the ER positive cells.
We think AAE is more effective on fast growing cells
without affecting cell cycle distribution. The high efficacy

of AAE on TNBC cells suggests potential clinical benefit.
TNBC patients generally do well if pathologic complete
response is achieved following chemotherapy however,
if residual disease exists and progresses to metastasis,
the prognosis is worse among the different breast cancer
subtypes.
We observed a close association of increased
autophagy with increased cytotoxicity of AAE.
Furthermore, the inhibition of autophagy decreased
AAE cytotoxicity. Autophagy was originally known for
its cytoprotective role by its ability to recycle nutrients
and maintain cellular homeostasis. However, recent
evidence suggests that autophagy can act as a cell death
mechanism [39, 40]. Although there is no clear consensus,
it is generally recognized that autophagy plays dual-role
in cell survival and death. There’s no clear definition of
the features of autophagic cell death (ACD), and the term
itself raised considerable discussion about its accuracy
[41, 42]. Recently, the Nomenclature Committee on Cell
Death (NCCD) proposed the criteria that the use of the
term ‘autophagic cell death’ should only come from a
functional perspective and limited to cases where cell
death is delayed by inhibition of the autophagic machinery
[43]. Although cautious, we base our assertion on the set
of criteria defining autophagy as a cell death mechanism
[40]: (i) cell death occurs without the involvement of
apoptosis; although apoptosis and autophagy are shown to
have cross-talks, they are not mutually exclusive and do
coincide [44]. We did not observe any sign of apoptosis
during AAE-induced cell death in BrCa cells. We saw no
sign of apoptosis in AAE induced cell death including,
no change in mitochondrial membrane potential, lack
of apoptosis associated caspases activation, and the
characteristic DNA fragmentation. Autophagy has been
mentioned as one type of caspase-independent cell
death [45]. Moreover, the fact that lack of ATP depletion
up to 24h after AAE treatment (data not shown) makes
necrotic cell death unlikely. (ii) There was an increase of
autophagic flux; autophagy is a dynamic process that can
be modulated both positively and negatively. The increase
in the detected marker (LC3B protein or fluorescent-LC3B
puncta) may reflect increased autophagosome formation
due to increases in autophagy, or to reduced turnover of
autophagosomes [24]. In this study, a combination of
AAE with lysosomal inhibitors that inhibit downstream
lysosomal degradation, increased LC3B level compared to
treatment with AAE or inhibitors alone. (iii) Suppression
of autophagy via both pharmacological inhibitors and
genetic approaches was able to rescue BrCa cells from cell
death. Our functional study which inhibited autophagy by
silencing ATG7 and ATG5 (key players in autophagosomes
formation) rescued BrCa cells from cell death, indicating
the pro-cytotoxic role of autophagy in AAE induced cell
death. In contrast, chemical autophagy inhibitors such as
3-methyladenine (3-MA) have also been shown to rescue
cell death in other systems, but not in our studies.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Interestingly, we found combination of 3-MA and
AAE resulted in an increased cell death in BrCa cells.
This might be due to the dual role of 3-MA on autophagy,
for instance, 3-MA is shown to promote autophagy when
cells are treated in serum containing medium [46], or due
to the low specificity of autophagy inhibitors: 3-MA was
found to have different temporal roles on class I and III
PI3K, and the autophagy inhibitory role was based on its
inhibition of class III PI3K [46].
Many studies have shown that the AKT/mTOR
pathway is critical in the regulation autophagy. AAE
greatly inhibited AKT phosphorylation as well as
mTOR phosphorylation. Noticeably, AAE not only
down-regulated the phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308,
which is involved with mTORC1 activation, but also
on the Ser473 site which is shown to be phosphorylated
by mTORC2 [47]. There has been evidence showing
that selective mTORC1 inhibition can elicit increased
AKT S473 phosphorylation and attenuates the signaling
effect on tumor cell proliferation [48, 49]. In this case,
AAE significantly decreased both sites of AKT which are
responsible for the activity of AKT [32] but also overcome
the potential re-activation of AKT at Ser473 by mTORC1
inhibition [50]. This inhibition effect was accompanied by
the decrease in phosphorylation of S6K and increase in
p-4EBP1, the downstream substrates of mTORC1 and key
regulators in cell growth, proliferation and survival [6].
In addition, we showed that down regulation of mTOR
pathway by AAE may explain the autophagy induction.
The ULK1(mammalian homologue of ATG1), ATG13,
FIP200 complex was shown to be the node for integrating
autophagy signals into autophagosome biogenesis [36] and
the direct phosphorylation of mTOR and AMPK on ULK1
was shown to regulate autophagy [35]. Consistently, we
found a decrease in phosphorylation of ULK1 Ser757,
which indicated ULK1 activation in AAE treated MCF7
cells, however, no such change was observed in MB231
cells. This might be because of the activation of ULK1
results from changes in different phosphorylation sites.
Furthermore Ser757, Ser317 and Ser777 of ULK1 are also
shown to be the direct phosphorylation sites for AMPK
whose increase indicates the activation of autophagy
under glucose deprivation. Although no change in
phosphorylation of ULK1 was found in MB231 cells,
we did observe the increase of ATG13, which is another
player in the complex bridging mTOR and autophagy.
We think both changes from ULK1 and ATG13 served
as evidence implying the role of Akt/mTOR cascades in
AAE mediated autophagy induction in BrCa cells. The
change of cellular energy status sensed by AMPK is a
well-known major upstream candidate for the mTOR
mediated autophagy induction, however, we did not detect
the activation of AMPK or ATP depletion in AAE treated
BrCa cells (data not shown), suggesting intracellular
metabolic stress is not the cause for autophagy induction.
Thus, our study suggests that the down regulation of Akt
16390

by AAE treatment caused mTOR inhibition which led to
autophagy induction.
We are aware that many of the activities on tumor
cell cytotoxicity of AAE may or may not be only due to
one single compound present abundantly in AAE. AAE
is a rich source of many glycoside-containing complex
polyphenols, including Ericifolin, gallyol pedunculagin,
penta-O-galloyl-β-glucose, simple polyphenol such as
gallic acid, elegiac acid, Eugenol, and many others,
some of which are not well characterized [51-53]. Our
preliminary attempts to reproduce autophagic cell death
in BrCa cells using compounds either commercially
available, or prepared in our laboratory were not
successful. Many of the known compounds mentioned
above induce apoptosis of BrCa cells, but no evidence of
autophagy. It is also possible that a combination of one
or more of already known compounds present in AAE
might induce the cytotoxic effect by activating autophagy.
Identification of active compound (s) that is cytotoxic to
BrCa cells by induction of autophagy is ongoing in the
authors’ laboratory (data not shown).
The antitumor and chemo-preventive activity of
AAE by oral gavage in MB231 model suggests a potential
clinical application of AAE. Oral gavage of AAE alone
showed significant antitumor activity, which was enhanced
when host-mice or tumor cells were pretreated with AAE
before injection, resulting in a more significant reduction
in tumor formation and growth. Importantly, we were
unable to detect any overt toxicity of AAE throughout
treatment at 150 mg/kg. In the group of pre-treatment
(chemoprevention) plus continuous AAE gavage, most
mice (4/6) showed smaller than palpable tumors (<40mm3)
throughout the duration of the experiment. The mechanism
of antitumor activity correlated with in vitro observations
and was attributed to autophagy, without any detectable
evidence of apoptosis.
It is to be noted that the results presented in this
report suggest potential synergy of AAE with rapamycin
(Figure 4F). Rapamycin has been shown to be both
chemo-preventive and anti-senescence compound when
taken daily at a low, non-immune compromising dose
[54, 55]. The main mechanism of rapamycin even at
low concentration is inhibition of mTOR. Therefore,
a combination dose of AAE and rapamycin daily may
contribute to longer delay in tumor recurrence of BrCa
patients and might suggest novel therapeutic avenue for
prevention of cancer and aging. However, considering
the poorly defined composition of AAE used in our
experiments, present a significant challenge to any
definitive suggestion for their human use at present.
Allspice is widely used in the Central American
cuisines as a seasoning spice for meat cooking or dessert
making. Although used as folk medicine in the Caribbean
and South America for a long time, few studies have
looked into the anticancer potential of Allspice [56]. No
epidemiological evidence for Allspice consumption with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer risk reduction exists. Previous work on prostate
cancer reported by us perhaps, the only such study, showed
berries of Pimenta dioica show anti-cancer property [18].
It should be noted however, the mechanism of anticancer
activity reported in the previous study pertains to unique
phenotype of prostate cancer, and the cytotoxicity was
clearly due to induction of apoptosis and inhibition of
androgen receptor transcription. Unique yet different
mechanism of anticancer activities of AAE on two major
human diseases, prostate and breast cancers promises
AAE to possess great potential as a dietary supplement
for cancer chemoprevention.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of AAE
A water extract of Certified-organic Pimenta
Dioica berries (Oregon Spice Company, Portland, OR)
were prepared as reported [18] and used in all studies
presented here. Briefly, a water extract of berries or
powdered Allspice prepared by boiling for 10 min at 10
% w/w, filtering the extract through Whatman #1 paper,
concentrating by lyophilization and re-dissolving the
freeze-dried sample at suitable concentration for studies
reported here. AAE thus extracted has been consistently
found to contain polyphenols at 38 %, carbohydrates (15
%), amino acids (1 %) etc., as detailed elsewhere [18].

Cell lines and reagents
All human BrCa cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB231,
SKBr3, BT474, and T47D) and non-malignant breast
epithelial cell lines MCF-10A and MCF-12A were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
(Corning Inc., New York) and supplemented with 10 %
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 20 μg/ml gentamicin at 37˚C
and 5 % CO2. MCF10A cells were cultured in a mammary
epithelial basal medium (MEBM, Invitrogen Inc.,
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with growth factor cocktail
SingleQuots™ Kit (LONZA Group, Switzerland). All cell
lines used in this study were authenticated for their origin
and genetic composition (Genetica DNA Laboratories Inc.
Cincinnati, OH). All cell cultures were routinely tested
against potential mycoplasma contamination and only
mycoplasma-free cultures were used in all experiments.

Cell proliferation and clonogenic assay
Cell viability was assessed by the methyl thiozolyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction assay and by cell
counting with trypan-blue exclusion. MCF10-A cells were
16391

Oncotarget

cultured in MEBM supplemented with 0.1 % BSA for 24h
of starvation, then exposed to various concentrations of
AAE for 72 h in both basal and growth-factor containing
medium for cell viability test. For clonogenic survival
assays, BrCa cells were plated at low density (500 -1,000
cells/35mm dish) following treatment with several
concentrations of AAE for 24h, washed, and replace
with fresh complete medium and then allowed to form
individual colonies. Colonies were stained and fixed in
1 % crystal violet after 10-12 days of culture and were
manually counted with colony criteria as described before
[18].

Group Inc. (Chicago IL). Equal loading of cell lysates
in western blots were ensured by loading equal amounts
of total cell proteins or cell equivalents by performing
either cell counts prior to solubilization with SDS-PAGE
gel sample buffer or by comparing the band densities of
specific proteins with that of β-actin. In blots that have
molecular mass close to that of β-actin, identical gel was
run with same cell lysates and immunoblotted for β-actin.

Analysis of cell morphology
MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in four-well LabTek Chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 106
cells/ml for 24h. Cultures were then incubated with AAE
(25-75µg/ml) or 100 nM rapamycin (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.,
St Louis, MO) for 24h. Cells were washed with PBS and
mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories., Burlingame, CA) and imaged under a
phase-contrast microscope.

Transfection
siRNA transfection: siRNA ATG7, siRNA ATG5,
and siRNA control were purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc. MB231 and MCF7 and MDA-MB231 cells
were seeded (1*105 cells per well) in 6-well plate RMPI
1640 supplemented with 10 % FBS without antibiotic and
left to attach for 24h, and were transfected with 25nM
siRNAs (Dharmafect On-target Plus) using Dharmafect 2
transfection reagents (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
Massachusetts, MA, USA). Transfected cells were
harvested and used for subsequent experiments 48h later.

Fluorescence confocal microscopy
BrCa cells were treated with AAE for 24h and the
detection of LC3B expression was conducted as described
[57]. The pattern of endogenous and induced expression of
Green Fluorescence-LC3 was observed using AxioVision
microscopy software (Zeiss Inc. NY).
For autolysosome detection by mCherry-GFP-LC3
transfection: 48h after plasmid transfection, cells were
treated with AAE for 12h and changed with fresh medium.
Then cells were washed and mounted with Vectashield
mounting medium with DAPI and visualized suing Carl
Zeiss Scanning Confocal microscopy (Zeiss Inc. NY).

Plasmid (mCherry-GFP-LC3B) DNA transfection
The mCheery-GFP-LC3B plasmid (AddGene
Inc., Cambridge, MA) was transfected into MCF7 cells
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Lipofectamin
2000 for MCF7, Life Technologies). About 4 x 104
cells/250µl were plated into 8-chambered glass slide
(LabTek Inc.) and incubated for 24h before 0.8μg of
plasmid diluted with Lipofectamin 2000 reagent (1:1 ratio)
was transfected into the cells. Transfection efficiency was
evaluated under microscopy for GFP signal after 12h, and
transfected cells were used for subsequent experiments
48hs later.

24 C57-B6 mice (Harlan Labs, Indianapolis, IN)
were randomly assigned to 2 groups. First group of mice
received IP injection of 300mg/kg AAE for several time
points (1, 3, 6, 8, and 24h). Second set with two mice
each received gavages of AAE (100, 150,200, and 300
mg/kg) daily for 2 weeks. Blood was drawn at the end of
treatment, centrifuged at 15,000g for 15min. and 10µl of
serum was taken and mixed with Methanol at 1:2 ratio.
This solution was mixed for 1 min in a vortex mixer,
centrifuged at 1,100X g for 15min and the supernatant was
used for polyphenol estimation [58]. Briefly, gallic acid
(10mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) was used as a standard
to estimate the total polyphenol in serum using 1:1 FolinDenis’ reagent (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) and 7.5 % sodium
carbonate. Samples were incubated at room temperature
for 30min and 0.1 ml was transferred into wells of 96-well
clusters and read at 765nm (Benchmark Plus Plate Reader,

Immunoblotting
Lysates from AAE-treated and AAE-untreated
cultures were prepared with cell lysis buffer, fractionated
and analyzed by immunoblotting [18]. Polyclonal

Grant Support

All experiments were carried out using an
institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC)
approved protocol. Number of animals per treatment
group was determined by power analysis as described
before (18). Six to eight week-old athymic female mice
(Harlan Labs, Indianapolis, IN,USA) were injected with
a suspension of MB-231 cells (2X106 cells/200μl/mouse)
mixed with solubilized basement membrane extract
(pathogen-clear BME, Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) at
1:1 ratio, at a subcutaneous site on the upper left flank.
Mice were gavaged daily with a solution of AAE in water
(150mg/kg). For testing the chemoprevention potential of
AAE, mice were gavaged AAE daily for 15 days before
injecting tumor cells. We pretreated the MB231 cells with
AAE in vitro for 48h and injected approximately same
number of viable cells (2 x 106) into mice. The mice were
then randomized to a control (group-4) or continuous AAE
gavage (150 mg/kg) group [group-5]. Tumor growth was
monitored over time by measuring tumor volume twice a
week with a hand held caliper and volume estimated as
described before (18). Tumors were considered palpable
if a firm nodule was palpable but was <3mm in diameter.
Mice were weighed weekly to identify any potential
systemic toxicity of AAE or changes due to tumor growth.
Systemic toxicity was also monitored by histologic
appearance of any abnormality in liver, lung, heart, and
kidney harvested at the time of necropsy.
