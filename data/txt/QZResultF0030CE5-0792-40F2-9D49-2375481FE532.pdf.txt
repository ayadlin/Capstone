Abstract

Author Manuscript

Development of targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major challenge.
We have recently identified an elevated expression of the fifth subunit of COP9 signalosome
(CSN5) in early HCC as compared to dysplastic stage. In the present study, we explored the
possibility of CSN5 being a potential therapeutic target for HCC. Our results show that CSN5
knockdown by small interfering (si) RNA caused a strong induction of apoptosis and inhibition of
cell cycle progression in HCC cells in vitro. The downregulation of CSN5 was sufficient to
interfere with CSN function as evidenced by the accumulation of neddylated Cullin1 and changes
in the protein levels of CSN controlled substrates SKP2, p53, p27 and NF-kB, albeit to a different
degree depending on the HCC cell line, which could account for the CSN5 knockdown phenotype.
The transcriptomic analysis of CSN5 knockdown signature showed that the anti-proliferative
effect was driven by a common subset of molecular alterations including downregulation of CDK6
and ITGB1, which were functionally interconnected with key oncogenic regulators MYC and
TGFβ1 involved in the control of proliferation, apoptotic cell death and HCC progression.
Consistent with microarray analysis, western blotting revealed that CSN5 depletion increased
phosphorylation of Smad 2/3, key mediators of TGFβ1 signaling, decreased the protein levels of
ITGB1, CDK6, and cyclin D1 and caused reduced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 while
elevating the levels of pro-apoptotic Bak. A chemically modified variant of CSN5 siRNA was
then selected for in vivo application based on the growth inhibitory effect and minimal induction
of unwanted immune response. Systemic delivery of the CSN5 3/8 variant by stable-nucleic-acidlipid-particles (SNALP) significantly suppressed the tumor growth in Huh7-luc+ orthotopic

Introduction

Author Manuscript

HCC is the third most lethal neoplasm causing an estimated 600,000 deaths annually due to
late diagnosis underlying liver disease and lack of effective treatment options (Parkin et al.,
2005; Llovet and Bruix, 2008; Bruix and Sherman, 2005; Llovet et al., 2008). However,
recent advances in the understanding the complex molecular pathways driving HCC indicate
that the early stages of HCC development are characterized by selection of certain common
traits (Thorgeirsson and Grisham, 2002). The progressive accumulation of genomic and
epigenetic alterations during the course of chronic liver disease affects numerous regulatory
pathways resulting in gradual loss of differentiation (Avila et al., 2000; Okabe et al., 2001;
Berasain et al., 2003) and selection of clones characterized by unrestrained proliferation and
resistance to cell death (Rust and Gores, 2000; Feitelson et al., 2002; Lee and Thorgeirsson,
2004; Arsura and Cavin, 2005). The comprehensive analysis of genomic changes during the
process of hepatocarcinogenesis may reveal suitable targets for preventing and treating HCC
through targeted therapy (Roberts and Gores, 2005).

Our previous microarray analysis revealed a consistent up-regulation of CSN5 gene in the
early HCC implying that CSN5 may be one of the early markers of malignant conversion
(Kaposi-Novak et al., 2009). CSN5, also known as JAB1 or COPS5, is the catalytic center
of COP9 signalosome (CSN), an evolutionary conserved multi-protein complex involved in
the control of proteolysis via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, transcription, protein
phosphorylation, and intracellular distribution (Wei et al., 2008; Kato and Yoneda-Kato,
2009; Chamovitz, 2009; Shackleford and Claret, 2010). Although the precise molecular
mechanisms remain to be elucidated, the most studied function of the CSN is the regulation
of protein degradation, which occurs primarily through the removal of NEDD8 (a ubiquitinlike modifier) from cullin-RING-E3 ligases (CRL), thereby regulating ligase activity.
Among the 8 CSN subunits (CSN1 to CSN8), CSN5 plays a central role in this
deneddylation activity and controls the stability of a great variety of key intracellular
regulators of survival and/or apoptotic programs, such as MYC, TGFβ1, MIF, c-Jun, HIF1α,
p27, E2F1, and p53, and may function either as a monomer or as the fifth component of
CSN complex. In addition to controlling the stability of proteins, the CSN also mediates
transcriptional regulation by mechanisms that are not yet clearly defined. In particular,
CSN5 seems to act as a transcriptional coactivator for MYC, which is essential for the
transcriptional activation of genes involved in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and cell
invasion (Claret et al., 1996; Bae et al., 2002; Adler et al., 2006). CSN5 activities positively
and negatively affect a number of pathways, including integrin signaling, cell cycle control,
and apoptosis. Given the diversity of functions and a large number of effector molecules
controlled by CSN5, we hypothesized that the inactivation of the overexpressed CSN5 gene

could result in reestablishment of numerous anti-oncogenic programs involved in the control
of cell proliferation and apoptosis and whereby be effective as an anti-cancer strategy.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a cellular mechanism for silencing gene expression which
triggers a sequence-specific degradation of target mRNA (Fire et al., 1998; Elbashir et al.,
2001). The double-stranded RNA substrates are enzymatically cleaved into siRNA and
mediate the suppression of target gene expression through a phylogenetically conserved
intrinsic pathway of multi-step processes (Sijen et al., 2001; Zamore, 2001). The
mechanistic insight raised the hope that RNAi could be harnessed for the development of
new drugs targeting all classes of pathological proteins (Hannon and Rossi, 2004; Bumcrot
et al., 2006). We have previously described the development of SNALP as an effective
systemic delivery vehicle for targeting siRNA to murine and primate liver as well as solid
tumors and have demonstrated robust therapeutic silencing of endogenous hepatocyte, tumor
or viral gene transcripts in the absence of any measurable immune response (Jeffs et al.,
2005; Morrissey and Blanchard et al., 2005; Zimmermann et al., 2006; Judge et al., 2009).

Here we report that siRNA-mediated CSN5 knockdown inhibits cell cycle progression and
greatly increases the rate of apoptosis in HCC cells in vitro. High-throughput transcriptomic
analysis of CSN5 knockdown signature revealed a common subset of molecular alterations
underlying the therapeutic responses, including down regulation of TGFβ1 and MYC-target
genes, such as integrin β1 (ITGB1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6). At the protein
level, CSN5 depletion in HCC cells increased the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and
expression of Bak with a concomitant down-regulation of NF-κB, CDK6, cyclin D1 and
Bcl-2, leading to apoptotic cell death. Finally, systemic delivery of the modified
CSN5siRNA encapsulated in SNALP remarkably inhibited hepatic tumor growth in an
orthotopic xenograft model of human liver cancer. These results demonstrate the important
role for CSN5 in liver cancer progression and suggest targeting CSN5 as a promising novel
tool for anti-cancer therapy.

Results
The biological effects of CSN5 knockdown in human HCC cells in vitro

Author Manuscript

To address the functions of CSN5, the HCC cell lines Huh7 and HepG2 cells were
transfected with three variants of CSN5-specific siRNA (CSN5-1-3) for 2 d, and efficiency
of CSN5 silencing was determined by analysis of the steady-state levels of CSN5 mRNA
and protein. The CSN5-2siRNA was the most effective in reducing CSN5 mRNA, and the
downregulation was correlated with a remarkable decrease in target protein (Figures 1a and
b). Consistent with these changes, CSN5-2siRNA caused a greater suppression of HCC cell
growth and therefore was selected for further studies (Figure 1c–e). In two examined cell
lines, Huh7 and HepG2, treatment with 15 nM CSN5-2siRNA resulted in 68% and 77%
growth inhibition, respectively. Transfection with negative control (NC) siRNA did not
affect cell growth. The growth inhibition in CSN5-depeleted HCC cells could be attributed
in part to the defective cell cycle progression. FACS analysis revealed accumulation of
G0/G1-phase cells and a concomitant decrease in the S-phase cells in both examined HCC
cell lines two days after treatment with CSN5-2siRNA (Figure 2a). However, the most
significant effect of CSN5 knockdown was a strong induction of apoptosis as measured by

an assay detecting the denatured single-stranded DNA formed in apoptotic cells but not in
the necrotic cells or cells with DNA breaks (Figure 2b). The result was reproduced in two
additional HCC cell lines Huh1 and PLC/PRF/5 which showed a similar reduction in growth
rate as a consequence of CSN5 silencing (Figure 2c). These data demonstrate that siRNAmediated knockdown of CSN5 in human HCC cells inhibit cell cycle progression and
increases predisposition to undergo apoptotic cell death.
The molecular mechanisms underlying the growth inhibitory effects of CSN5 knockdown

Author Manuscript

To identify the molecular targets and common mechanisms underlying the growth inhibitory
effects caused by CSN5 silencing, Huh7 and HepG2 cells were treated with either
NCsiRNA or CSN5-2siRNA for 48 h and subjected to transcriptomic analysis using gene
expression microarrays. In both cell lines, we achieved a strong (> 8-fold) CSN5-specific
inhibition (Figure 3a). The number of differentially expressed genes which displayed more
than a 2-fold change was 768 (402 up- and 366 down-regulated genes) and 349 (127 up- and
222 down-regulated genes) in Huh7 and HepG2 cells, respectively, using permuted
Bootstrap t-test (P < 0.05) (Supplementary Figures 1a and 2a). Given involvement of CSN5
gene in liver cancer progression, we then focused on the expressions of genes functionally
interconnected with its principal regulators, MYC and TGFβ1. Consistent with the reported
functional relationships (Wei et al., 2008; Kato and Yoneda-Kato, 2009), numerous genes
affected by CSN5 inactivation in HCC cells were known/putative targets of MYC or TGFβ1
(Supplementary Figures 1b and c and Supplementary Figures 2b and c).

To further explore the molecular mechanisms of CSN5 response, we have generated a
common CSN5 knockdown signature consisting of 127 deregulated genes (Figure 3b and
Supplementary Table 1). Using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software, we
identified common statistically significant pathway networks (score >22), suggesting that
molecular alterations in the diverse oncogenic pathways may cooperatively result in the
growth inhibition of HCC cells in response to CSN5 inactivation. The pattern of gene
expression and the top biological functions in each network are shown in Supplementary
Table 2. A PathwayStudio analysis illustrates that despite a limited gene to gene overlap, the
expressions of twelve genes, known to be associated with MYC and/or TGFβ1 pathway,
such as CDK6, BRCA1, ATF3, EIF2S1, SLC2A1, ITGB1, MMP11, GSN, TIMP2, PDGFβ,
FSTL3 and LPL, were commonly deregulated (Figure 3c and d). Consisting with phenotypic
changes, expressions of genes that are functionally involved in pro-apoptotic activity and
tumor suppression (ATF3, MPM11, GSN, TIMP2, and FSTL3) were upregulated.
Conversely, genes involved in anti-apoptosis, cell cycle progression, survival and metastasis
(CDK6, EIF2S1, SLC2A1, ITGB1, and LPL) were downregulated. In particular, the cell
cycle promoting function of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) which associates with cyclin
D and targets the retinoblastoma protein to allow passage through the G1/S phase restriction
point has been shown to have functional relationships with TGFβ1 and MYC (Mateyak et al.,
1999; Tsubari et al., 1999).
To gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking growth suppression in
HCC cells to the CSN5 deletion, we performed an extensive Western blot analysis of CSN
components and selected CSN-controlled substrates. Supporting CSN5-specific inhibition

on mRNA levels (Figure 3a), we found a significant reduction only in CSN5 protein levels
while other CSN subunits (e.g. CSN1, CSN3 and CSN8) showed little or no change (Figure
4a). siRNA-mediated CSN5 silencing was sufficient to disrupt the CSN complex, and
induced Cullin 1 hyperneddylation which was paralleled by a decrease in free NEDD8
(Figure 4a). Concomitant with a loss of CSN5 function, both examined HCC cell lines
showed a decrease in the protein level of SKP2, a substrate-targeting subunit of the ubiquitin
ligase complex that regulates entry into S phase by inducing the degradation of the cyclindependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 (Bashir et al., 2004). Interestingly, MYC, another
candidate substrate of CSN-controlled ubiquitin ligases which could account for CSN5
knockdown phenotype, showed no obvious changes in the protein levels while accumulation
of p53 as well as p27, a target of SKP2, was found only in HepG2 cell line characterized by
wild type p53, but not in the p53 mutant Huh7 cells, reflecting cell type-specific differences
(Figure 4a). However, in agreement with microarray data, and consistent with inhibition of
cell cycle progression by CSN5 inactivation (Figure 1 and 2), both cell lines showed
reduction in protein levels of cyclin D1, CDK6, and ITGB1 involved in the control of cell
cycle progression although the expression of cyclin E, another regulator of G1 phase, as well
as CDK2 and cyclin A, implicated in S and G2/M transition, were unaffected
(Supplementary Figure 3). In support of the microarray analysis, CSN5 silencing caused
increased phosphorylation of Smad 2 and 3, key mediators in TGFβ1 signaling, involved in
the control of apoptotic cell death (Figure 4b). In addition, we found a significantly
reduction in the NF-kB p65 level in both examined cell lines and a concomitant
downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 reflecting defective NF-kB activation in agreement
with recent data linking CSN function to IkB-α regulation (Panattoni et al., 2008). In
contrast, the levels of proapoptotic Bak were increased suggesting that activation of TGFβ1
signaling and/or inhibition of NF-κB pathway may be common mechanisms of growth
inhibition and apoptotic induction following CSN5 inactivation.
Importantly, CSN5 knockdown also caused a compensatory upregulation of platelet-derived
growth factor beta (PDGFβ), and decreased the expression of tumor suppressor BRCA1,
reflecting a complex molecular dynamics caused by targeted inactivation of a single gene.
When we blocked PDGFβ expression by siRNA, we found a significant reduction in
survival and increased caspase-3-mediated apoptosis (Figure 4d and e) suggesting that a
combined inactivation of several putative targets can amplify the therapeutic effect of CSN5
deletion in HCC cells. Taken together, these results show that siRNA depletion of a single
gene may coordinately impact diverse oncogenic pathways acting in concert to drive liver
cancer progression and provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of CSN5.

Systemic delivery of CSN5 siRNA by SNALP suppresses orthotopic liver tumor growth
The next step was to validate if systemic silencing of CSN5 could suppress liver tumor
growth. To prevent immune activation and enhance siRNA stability in vivo, native
CSN5-2siRNA was chemically modified by selective incorporation of 2′-O-methyl (2′OMe)
uridine or guanosine nucleosides into one strand of the siRNA duplex, and encapsulated into
SNALP. A modified siRNA was then screened for in vivo application in terms of Huh7-luc+
cell growth and cytokine induction using murine Flt3L dendricytes isolated from mouse
bone marrow. Among the variants tested, CSN5 3/8 sequence was the most effective in

inhibiting tumor cell growth (about 80%) (Figure 5a). In addition, the modified sequence
caused a minimal induction of IL-6 as compared to the treatment with native CSN5-2siRNA
while injection of empty SNALP had little effect on IL-6 levels (Figure 5b).

Author Manuscript

To test the therapeutic efficacy of CSN5 gene targeting we used an orthotopic mouse model
of hepatocarcinoma and bioluminescence imaging (BLI) as a method of monitoring the
kinetics of tumor growth. Mice with liver tumors derived from Huh7-luc+ cells were
randomly assigned either to treatment or control group before starting siRNA therapy
(Figure 6). The results showed that in control group treated with SNALP-βgal478 targeting
β-galactosidase, tumors grew very rapidly and at the end point of the study (28 days)
occupied a significant portion of liver parenchyma. In addition, the majority of mice
developed ascites reflecting impairment of liver function characteristic for the end stage of
liver cancer disease. In striking contrast, SNALP-CSN5 3/8 effectively inhibited the hepatic
tumor growth formed by Huh7-luc+ cells and significantly improved well being of animals
(Figure 6a and b). Consistent with this, mice receiving siRNA therapy showed a better
histology with single and much smaller tumors as well as reduction in liver-to-body ratios as
reflection of the reduced tumor burden (Figure 6c and d). These results indicate that CSN5 is
an important regulator of HCC growth and may represent a promising target for systemic
therapy of human HCC.

Discussion

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Hepatocarcinogenesis is a multi-step process driven by the accumulation of multiple genetic
and epigenetic alterations (Thorgeirsson and Grisham, 2002). Previously, we have identified
MYC as one of the driver genes for malignant conversion from the dysplastic stage to early
HCC (Kaposi-Novak et al., 2009). Notably, the presence of the MYC signature significantly
correlated with increased expression of CSN5, as well as with a higher overall transcription
rate of genes located in the 8q chromosome region. However, the significance of CSN5
upregulation in liver cancer has remained undetermined. In this study, we demonstrate that
siRNA-mediated knockdown of CSN5 caused a consistent and strong induction of apoptotic
cell death and delayed cell cycle progression in the examined human HCC cells. These
results suggest that overexpression of CSN5 may contribute to both cell survival and
proliferation and thus represent a prognostic marker for malignant conversion in liver
cancer. CSN5 overexpression has been also found in breast, thyroid, skin, ovarian, lung and
pancreatic cancer (Sui et al., 2001; Esteva et al., 2003; Ito et al., 2003; Kouvaraki et al.,
2003; Fukumoto et al., 2004; Goto et al., 2004; Ivan et al., 2004; Adler et al., 2008),
implying that CSN5 targeting may be an effective therapeutic strategy against various
cancer types. Consistent with this, depletion of CSN5 has been shown to result in growth
inhibition of pancreatic cell line (Fukumoto et al., 2006).
The massive apoptosis and defective cell cycle progression in CSN5-depleted HCC cells
was paralleled by coordinated dysregulation of numerous gene expression programs acting
downstream of CSN5-regulated transcription factors. As shown in Figure 3, at
transcriptional level, CSN5 knockdown-mediated downregulation of CDK6, a key regulator
in G1/S phase transition, was functionally associated with both MYC and TGFβ1, and
correlated with the increased expression of proapoptotic effectors (e.g. ATF3, activating

transcription factor 3) (Kashiwakura et al., 2008), or activator of metastasis (e.g. MMP11,
matrix metalloproteinase 11) (Brasse et al., 2010). In this study we also found that the
decreased levels of CDK6 and cyclin D1 proteins were correlated with the activation of
TGFβ1 and inhibition of NF-κB pathways (Figure 4b). These observations may provide the
molecular mechanism(s) underlying the phenotypic changes triggered by siRNA silencing of
CSN5 expression, such as inhibition of G1/S transition and induction of apoptosis.

Among the important findings of the study is the demonstration of high efficiency of CSN5
targeting in a mouse xenograft model of human liver cancer. The primary obstacle for
therapeutic application of RNAi is a successful delivery to targeted cell type in vivo (Pai et
al., 2006; Hokaiwado et al., 2008). The SNALP-based technology has unique technical
advantages for a systemic siRNA delivery to liver (Rossi, 2006; Whitehead et al., 2009).
First, target siRNA modified and incorporated into SNALP is protected from both
glomerular filtration and serum nucleases whereby increasing the half-life of the circulating
siRNA. In particular, 2′OMe-modification of siRNA utilized in this study mediated potent
silencing of target mRNA without cytokine induction, toxicity or off-target effects
associated with unmodified siRNA (Judge and Robbins et al., 2005; Judge and Sood et al.,
2005). Second, the use of SNALP technology allowed reducing the dosing regimen up to 3
mg/kg, which is 10-fold less as compared to the standard dose of siRNA without a carrier
(Morrissey and Blanchard et al., 2005). In our study, treatment with a moderate dose of 2
mg/kg was sufficient for the effective suppression of liver tumor growth in vivo (Figure 6).
Finally, SNALP formulated target siRNA injected intravenously primarily traffics to liver
and spleen with little accumulation in other organs. Although more work is needed to
optimize the therapeutic dose of SNALP-target siRNA for different stages of HCC disease,
our work demonstrates the potency of systemic RNAi targeting of CSN5 without an overt
toxicity in a mouse model of orthotopic transplantation of human HCC cells and suggests its
clinical utility for treatment of HCC disease.

Pathway Analysis tool (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA). The significance of
each network was estimated by scoring system provided by Ingenuity. The scores were
determined by the number of differentially expressed genes within each network and the
strength of the associations among the network members. Once over-represented and
functionally relevant genes were identified, their functional association was validated by
independent pathway analysis tool PathwayStudio (Ariadne Genomics, Rockville, MD,
USA).
Generation of HCC reporter cell line expressing luciferase

Author Manuscript

Huh7 cells were transfected with pGL4.17 vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) expressing
firefly luciferase and neomycin resistance gene using Lipofectamine 2000. To enhance the
expression of luciferase gene, β-actin promoter from pCAGEN plasmid (Addgene,
Cambridge, MA, USA) was subcloned into multicloning site of pGL4.17. Cells were
selected for antibiotic resistance with Geneticin (Invitrogen), and surviving colonies were
amplified and screened for bioluminescence in complete media supplemented with 150
μg/ml D-luciferin (Biosynth International, Itasca, IL, USA) by in vitro imaging (IVIS

Systemic administration of SNALP-formulated siRNA and BLI in vivo

Author Manuscript

Six-week-old male SCID/Beige mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA)
were anesthetized by inhalation of 5% isoflorane in oxygen. Cells (5 × 105 in 50 μL
phosphate-buffered saline) were injected into the splenic pulp using a 27-gauge needle.
Spleen was removed 30 sec after injection and wound was closed in two layers using 3-0
silk suture and surgical clips. Body and liver weights were recorded at death. Animals were
housed in an AAALAC facility and cared for in accordance with the guidelines from the
Animal Care and Use Committee at the US National Cancer Institute, NIH. Mice with liver
tumors derived from Huh7-luc+ cells were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups
based on bioluminescence imaging before initiation of siRNA-therapy. SNALP-formulated
siRNAs (2 mg/kg) were injected into the lateral tail vein four times with a 3-day interval.
Tumor growth was monitored by BLI for 4-weeks with 3–4 day intervals using an IVIS
Imaging System. Images and measurements of luciferase signals were analyzed using Living
Image Software (Xenogen). Ten minutes prior to in vivo imaging, mice were anesthesized
with 1–3% isoflurane (Abbott Laboratories) and given an i.p. injection luciferin (Biosynth
International) at 150 mg/kg in DPBS. Regions of interest (ROI) from displayed images were
drawn around the tumor sites and quantified as photons/second using the software.
