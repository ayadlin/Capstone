Abstract
Despite the presence of known mutagens and carcinogens in
cigarette smoke, there is currently no evidence to show that
smoking, or exposure to cigarette smoke, can result in
heritable genetic mutation. We show that male mice exposed
to mainstream tobacco smoke (MTS) exhibit a significant
increase in germ-line mutation frequency in spermatogonial
stem cells. We exposed mature male mice to MTS for 6 or
12 weeks and investigated mutations arising in exposed
spermatogonial stem cells at the expanded simple tandem
repeat locus Ms6-hm. A generalized score test showed a
significant treatment effect (P = 0.0214). Ms6-hm mutation
frequency was 1.4 and 1.7 times higher in mice exposed to MTS
for 6 and 12 weeks, respectively, compared with sham
controls. The data suggest that mutations accumulate in the
spermatogonial stem cells with extended exposures. Mutation
spectra were identical between exposed and sham individuals,
supporting the hypothesis that tandem repeat mutations arise
through indirect mechanisms of mutation. Mutations in sperm
that are passed on to offspring cause permanent, irreversible
changes in genetic composition and can persist in future
generations. Our research suggests that the consequences of
smoking extend beyond the smoker to their nonsmoking
descendents. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5103–6]

Introduction
It has been estimated that half a billion smokers will die of
smoking-associated disease (1). Despite this, over a billion people
worldwide continue to smoke. Unarguably, it is a major public
health concern, and deterrents are greatly needed to encourage
individuals to reduce or discontinue smoking. Mainstream tobacco
smoke (MTS) contains more than 4,000 chemicals, many of which
are genotoxic, and is considered the most extreme example of a
human systemic mutagen (2). The mechanisms by which exposure
to tobacco smoke causes cancers have been studied extensively
over the past 20 years. One mechanism thought to result in cancer
operates through the mutagenic activity of components of tobacco
smoke (reviewed in ref. 2). Exposure to cigarette smoke condensate
in vitro is mutagenic in the Ames and SOS bacterial assays and
induces mutation in the Tk +/ locus in mouse lymphoma cells
and Hprt mutations in Chinese hamster ovary cells (reviewed in

refs. 2, 3). Many studies have shown that exposure to cigarette
smoke condensate and MTS can cause DNA damage (strand breaks
and micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations) in somatic cells
in vitro and in vivo in animal models (4). Human smokers show
increased numbers of DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes, buccal
cells, and urothelial cells; higher HPRT mutation frequency in
peripheral blood lymphocytes; and enhanced urinary mutagenicity
(reviewed in ref. 2). The results of these studies show that tobacco
smoke is clearly a mammalian somatic cell mutagen.
In addition to cancer and mutation, exposure to MTS is also
known to cause reproductive effects such as infertility (5). DNA
strand breaks, DNA adducts, chromosomal aberrations, and
aneuploidy arise in human sperm as a result of exposure to MTS
and provide indirect support that MTS is a human germ cell
mutagen (2). However, structural and numerical anomalies, such as
breaks and aneuploidies, are the result of exposure to clastogens
and are likely to be lethal to the developing embryo (6). There are no
data showing that exposure to MTS causes heritable DNA sequence
mutation in humans or in any animal model. The implications of
increased heritable DNA sequence mutation include potential
changes in the incidence of genetic diseases (including cancer)
among the non-exposed descendents of smokers. In this study, we
investigate DNA sequence mutation at expanded simple tandem
repeat (ESTR) DNA in sperm samples from mature male mice
exposed to MTS for 6 or 12 weeks. ESTRs are highly unstable in the
germ-line and provide the most sensitive marker available today for
the measurement of induced germ-line mutation (7, 8).

Materials and Methods
Animal care and husbandry. Twenty mature (8–10 weeks old) male
C57BL/6  CBA F1 hybrid mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were used in this
study. Mice were housed in a 12-h light-dark cycle with food and water
ad libitum. Cages, food, and bedding were autoclaved. To control for
handling, groups of mice were placed simultaneously in restrainers only
(sham exposure). Mice were exposed to MTS in a smoke exposure system that
was initially developed for guinea pigs (9) and has since been adapted for
mice (10). Mice were placed in individual exposure chambers (9  3  3 cm3)
and were exposed to two cigarettes daily (1R3 reference cigarettes; Tobacco
and Health Research Institute, University of Kentucky). Cigarette smoke was
delivered into the exposure chambers at a rate of 0.08 L/min, 1 puff (20 mL)
per 52 s. In an initial 2-week lead up period, mice were exposed to one
cigarette in the 1st week and to two cigarettes in the 2nd week. Animals were
then exposed 5 days/wk for a total of 6 weeks, or 12 weeks, including the
2-week lead-up period. Both exposure groups (alongside matched sham
controls) were housed for an additional 6 weeks following the final cigarette
to allow for the maturation of spermatogonial stem cells. Animals were
euthanized, and caudal epidydimus was collected and stored at 80jC. All
animal procedures were carried out under the guidelines of the Canadian
Council on Animal Care and procedures approved by the McMaster
University Animal Research Ethics Board.

Isolation of DNA for mutational analysis. All isolations and
manipulations before gel electrophoresis were carried out in a laminar flow
hood in a different laboratory room to minimize the risk of contamination of
the PCR templates. The methods used were similar to those described in
Yauk et al. (11). Caudal epidydimus DNA was finely chopped in PBS, filtered,
and centrifuged. The sperm pellet was resuspended in 1  SSC, and the
somatic cells were lysed in 0.15% SDS. The lysate was removed by
centrifugation, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 0.2  SSC, 1%
SDS, 1 mol/L 2-mercaptoethanol and digested with Proteinase K.
Elimination of somatic cells was confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy.
DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction. Five micrograms of
DNA were digested using MseI (10 units at 37jC overnight). The DNA was
then diluted in buffer [5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8)] supplemented with
5 ng/AL carrier Herring Sperm DNA before PCR amplification.
Detection of mutants. Template DNA was diluted in the PCR to
concentrations that allowed f40% to 60% of amplifications to produce
observable products. The Ms6-hm locus (accession no. S69706) was
amplified with 0.5 Amol/L flanking primers HM1 forward (5¶-AGAGTTTCTAGTTGCTGTGA-3¶) and HM1 reverse (5¶-GAGAGTCAGTTCTAAGGC-3¶)
using a PTC-225 DNA Engine Tetrad Thermocycler unit (MJ Research). PCR
products were visualized by gel electrophoresis, Southern blotting and
hybridization with a32P radiolabeled Ms6-hm probe. Positive PCR amplicons
of the CBA 1.7-kb Ms6-hm allele were run on 40-cm, 0.7% agarose gels at 230
V in cooled chambers (15jC) for 20 to 24 h. Gels were Southern blotted onto
nylon membranes and hybridized with Ms6-hm probe for visualization using

a phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics, Storm 860). The image sizes of the
blots were normalized to achieve 4.5-cm spacing between the 4- and 5-kbp
bands of an in-lane DNA standard (50 ng per well of 1-kbp INVITROGEN
ladder). All gels were scored blindly by two individuals, without prior
knowledge of sample identities. The Ms6-hm alleles were sized relative to the
in-lane standard. The distance of each Ms6-hm band was measured from the
internal lane standards to determine size. Bands were classified as mutants if
their size differed from the progenitor allele by more than 4 repeat units. This
is a conservative estimate of mutation, but allows high confidence in the
measured amplicon length change. With the assumption that each mutant
allele scored represents just one template molecule, the mutation frequency
becomes the ratio of the number of mutant bands to template molecules.
The total number of template molecules per 96-well PCR plate was
estimated using a statistical approximation (see below).
Statistical analysis. The number of progenitor PCR template molecules
was determined from the number of positive PCR products using the
Poisson distribution, estimated within technical replicates of samples. The
rate variable was estimated by taking the natural log of the observed
number of PCR wells with no product to the total number of PCR wells run.
The ratio of the exposed to control mutation frequencies was estimated by
back-transforming results from the Wald statistic with the empirical
covariance matrix using the GENMOD Procedure in the SAS/STAT
software, version 8.2 of the SAS System for Windows (1999–2001 SAS
Institute, Inc.). A generalized score test was used to examine treatment
effect in SAS.

Results and Discussion
Analysis of replicates of spermatogonial DNA from individual
sham males yielded a mean Ms6-hm mutation frequency of 3.7%
(range, 2.2–6.9%) and a significant bias towards gain mutations
(generalized score test, P = 0.005; Fig. 1A and B) in keeping with
published data (11, 12). There was no significant difference in
mutation frequencies between 6- and 12-week sham samples. Mean
Ms6-hm mutation frequencies were 5.1% (range, 3.9–6.9%) and 6.3%
(range, 4.6–9.6%) following exposure to MTS for 6 or 12 weeks
(Table 1). A significant increase in mutation frequency was found
following exposure to MTS for 12 weeks (P = 0.044). A generalized
score test showed a significant treatment effect (P = 0.021) and a
50% increase in overall mutation frequency for the combined
exposures (Table 1).
We show that exposure to MTS for 12 weeks caused DNA
sequence mutation in spermatogonial stem cells in mature mice.
These data provide the first evidence that smoking causes
paternal germ-line DNA sequence mutation in any mammal.
Our previous work showed that Ms6-hm mutation frequencies
measured in sperm DNA were indistinguishable from those
measured in offspring using conventional pedigree analysis (11).
Therefore, paternal Ms6-hm mutations arising in sperm may be
inherited by progeny. These mutations are thought not to result
from direct damage to the DNA at the site of mutation but rather
result from an indirect process attributed to factors elsewhere in
the paternal germ-line (8, 11). In keeping with this hypothesis, the
spectra of mutations (defined in this case as the frequency distribution of size mutants) were identical between MTS- and shamexposed mice (generalized score test, P = 0.19; Fig. 1A and B).
One hypothesis for indirect induced mutation is DNA damage
elsewhere in the genome (non-targeted DNA damage, another
cellular signal, or possibly epigenetic signals) causes DNA
polymerases to pause to repair damage. If a pause in a polymerase
crossing an ESTR locus occurs, hairpins may result that are
transformed into mutations upon replication re-initiation. It is
hypothesized that the pausing of replication facilitates replication
slippage events that result from the formation of secondary

www.aacrjournals.org

structures among repeat sequences in the ESTR arrays (13, 14).
Our data suggest that cigarette smoke exposure interferes with
normal DNA metabolism, or replication, through similar processes
and results in de novo DNA sequence mutation. Increased germline DNA mutation may affect the incidence of genetic disease in
the offspring of fathers who smoked before conception. The
findings indicate that the repercussions of smoking may extend
beyond cancer and mutation in exposed individuals, to their
unexposed descendents, and potentially contribute to the
population burden of genetic disease.
MTS exposure caused a 1.4- and 1.7-fold increase in ESTR
mutation frequency over sham-exposed males after 6 and 12 weeks
of exposure, respectively (Table 1). As mutation frequencies were
higher in the longer-exposure (12 weeks) group, the data further
indicate that mutations may accumulate in the spermatogonial
stem cells. Therefore, the longer the exposure, the higher the
potential risk for heritable mutation. Further work is necessary to
confirm this prediction.
Previous analyses have shown that ESTR loci are sensitive to
both chronic and acute high- and low-LET radiation (12), specific
highly mutagenic chemicals (15), and heavily contaminated
industrial air particulate pollution (16, 17). ESTR mutations arise
through an indirect mechanism that results in genetic instability at
repeat loci in the germ line (8, 18) but correlate with DNA sequence
mutation at other endogenous protein-coding loci (19). However, a
clear relationship between tandem repeat instability and mutation
induction at protein coding loci is currently unknown. Nevertheless, size changes at many tandem repeats have important
functional consequences, such as those at the triplet repeat disease
loci (20). There may be a larger number of loci at which more
subtle functional effects remain to be discovered. Therefore, the
consequences of increased tandem repeat mutation should not be
dismissed as unimportant (20). Accordingly, it would be prudent
for men who smoke to curtail such activity before reproduction.
Further studies should investigate the persistence of instability
following MTS exposure to determine the minimum recommended
cessation period before reproduction.
