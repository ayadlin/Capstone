ABSTRACT
Identifying druggable targets in the Wnt-signaling pathway can optimize
colorectal cancer treatment. Recent studies have identified a member of the RNA
helicase family DDX3 (DDX3X) as a multilevel activator of Wnt signaling in cells
without activating mutations in the Wnt-signaling pathway. In this study, we
evaluated whether DDX3 plays a role in the constitutively active Wnt pathway that
drives colorectal cancer.
We determined DDX3 expression levels in 303 colorectal cancers by
immunohistochemistry. 39% of tumors overexpressed DDX3. High cytoplasmic DDX3
expression correlated with nuclear β-catenin expression, a marker of activated Wnt
signaling. Functionally, we validated this finding in vitro and found that inhibition of
DDX3 with siRNA resulted in reduced TCF4-reporter activity and lowered the mRNA
expression levels of downstream TCF4-regulated genes. In addition, DDX3 knockdown
in colorectal cancer cell lines reduced proliferation and caused a G1 arrest, supporting
a potential oncogenic role of DDX3 in colorectal cancer.
RK-33 is a small molecule inhibitor designed to bind to the ATP-binding site of
DDX3. Treatment of colorectal cancer cell lines and patient-derived 3D cultures with
RK-33 inhibited growth and promoted cell death with IC50 values ranging from 2.5 to
8 μM. The highest RK-33 sensitivity was observed in tumors with wild-type APC-status
and a mutation in CTNNB1.
Based on these results, we conclude that DDX3 has an oncogenic role in colorectal
cancer. Inhibition of DDX3 with the small molecule inhibitor RK-33 causes inhibition
of Wnt signaling and may therefore be a promising future treatment strategy for a
subset of colorectal cancers.

INTRODUCTION

player in the constitutionally activated Wnt signaling that
drives colorectal cancer and to assess whether DDX3
inhibition by the small molecule RK-33 is a suitable
therapeutic strategy in this cancer type.

Although significant advancements have been made
in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer, this
disease still ranks third on the list of causes of cancer
related deaths in the United States, which underlines
the need for development of new targeted therapies in
this field. [1] On a genomic level colorectal cancer is
frequently characterized by loss of the tumor suppressor
gene p53 and activation of the RAS-RAF signaling
pathway, alterations that are common in a multitude of
solid tumors. In addition, activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway is prevailing and more specific to the
colorectal cancer setting, where genetic aberrations in this
pathway are found in over 90 percent of cases. The most
common alteration is inactivation of the APC gene (>70%).
Activating mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding for
β-catenin, are less prevalent (5–10%). [2] Thus, identifying
druggable targets in this pathway would be beneficial for
optimizing colorectal cancer treatment.
Within this context, we identified a member of
the RNA helicase gene family, DDX3, which exhibits
oncogenic properties in breast and lung carcinomas.
[3, 4] In order to therapeutically exploit the benefits of
abrogating DDX3 activity in these cancers, we developed
a small molecule inhibitor, RK-33, designed to bind
to the ATP-binding domain of DDX3 and inhibit its
RNA-helicase activity. [4] Potent anti-cancer activity
was observed in lung cancer mouse models after DDX3
inhibition by RK-33.
Recent studies indicate that DDX3 is a multilevel
activator of the Wnt-signaling pathway. DDX3 was
identified as an allosteric activator of CK1ɛ and hereby
promotes phosphorylation of the scaffold protein
dishevelled, which activates Wnt signaling during
Caenorhabditis elegans and Xenopus development and in
mammalian HEK293t cells. This function of DDX3 was
independent of its RNA-helicase activity. [5] In addition,
DDX3 was found to regulate the stability of β-catenin
protein expression in a helicase-dependent manner
through translational regulation of Rac1. [6] In addition,
our group identified a direct interaction between DDX3
and β-catenin and its functional role in regulating TCF-4
mediated transcriptional activity in lung cancer cell lines.
[4] Notably, DDX3 activity has also been linked to Wntsignaling activity by the identification of coinciding
CTNNB1 and DDX3X activating mutations in Wnt-type
medulloblastomas. [7–9]
These mechanistic studies all indicate an important
role of DDX3 in Wnt signaling in both normal and
transformed cells, but focus on a situation without
activating mutations in the Wnt-signaling pathway.
It  remains to be determined whether colorectal cancer
cells, which usually harbor activating mutations in the
Wnt-signaling pathway, are dependent on DDX3 as well.
In this study, we aimed to evaluate DDX3 as a potential

RESULTS
DDX3 inhibition results in growth inhibition in
colorectal cancer cell lines
To assess DDX3 dependency, we used siRNA to
knock down DDX3 expression in the colorectal cell lines
HCT116 and HT29 (Figure 1A). DDX3 knockdown
resulted in a reduction of cell proliferation in both cell
lines (Figure 1B). To evaluate whether the reduction of
viable cells was the result of reduced proliferation or
increased cell death, we performed cell cycle analysis
by flow cytometry on these cell lines after treatment
with siDDX3. As seen in Figure 1C, cell cycle analysis
indicated a clear G1 arrest in HCT116 cells with a 15.8%
increase in G1-phase (p = 0.02) and a 17.0% decrease of
cells in S-phase (p = 0.01). In addition, a slight decrease
in S-phase was observed in HT29 (3.4%; p = 0.05).
These results indicate that these colorectal cell lines are
dependent on DDX3 for cell cycle progression.

DDX3 expression in colorectal cancer patient
samples
To evaluate whether DDX3 is also expressed in
colorectal cancers, we immunohistochemically stained
303 colorectal cancer specimens for DDX3 (Figure 2).
High cytoplasmic DDX3 expression was present in
124 samples (40.9%). Corresponding normal mucosa
was available for 59 cases. Intratumoral expression was
higher in 23 patients (39.0%; Figure 2A-2D), similar in
32 patients (54.2%; Figure 2E-2F) and lower in 4 patients
(6.8%; Figure 2G-2H), when compared to the surrounding
morphologically normal mucosa.
Next, we compared DDX3 expression to other
known clinicopathological characteristics (Table 1). Within
this cohort of samples, DDX3 expression did not correlate
with any of the other clinicopathological variables.

High DDX3 expression correlates with nuclear
β-catenin
Given the activating role of DDX3 in Wnt signaling
in other settings, [4] we wanted to determine whether
high DDX3 expression is associated with activated Wnt
signaling in colorectal cancer patient samples as reflected
by an increased cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin
pool (Figure 3). We separately scored the membranous,
cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of β-catenin in
tumors with low and high DDX3 expression, which is
shown in Table 2. Nuclear β-catenin expression was
28313

significantly more prevalent in the DDX3 high group
(59.3%) when compared to the DDX3 low group (33.5%;
RR = 1.77; 95%  CI = 1.36–2.31; p = 2.47 ×  10−5),
indicating a connection between DDX3 levels and nuclear
β-catenin accumulation. In addition, a trend was observed
for more frequent overexpression of cytoplasmic β-catenin
in DDX3 high tumors (73% vs 63%; RR  =  1.16;  95% 
CI  =  0.99–1.36; p = 0.08), which often coincides with
nuclear β-catenin expression as shown in Figure 3D.

The differences in cell cycle distribution were more
profound than the increase in apoptotic cells, indicating that
the primary effect of DDX3 inhibition is a G1 arrest, which
ultimately can result in apoptosis.
Both adherent cell lines and spheroids could be
separated into two groups; a sensitive group of cell lines
with an IC50 value <  3 μM (HCT116, CRC29, HT29)
and a group with a 2–3 fold higher IC50 value ranging
from 5–9 μM (CR9, DLD-1, CRC47, SW480, Colo205,
L145). Next, we assessed the functional role of DDX3
in the cell lines that were less sensitive to RK-33,
by knocking down DDX3 with siDDX3 (Figure 4G).
Unlike the RK-33 sensitive cell lines HCT116 and HT29,
proliferation in DLD-1 and SW480 was not affected by
DDX3 knockdown (Figure 4H) and only a moderate drop
in S-phase was observed in SW480 (3.7%; p = 0.02).
No effect on cell cycle was seen in DLD-1 (Figure 4I).

Sensitivity of colorectal cancers to RK-33,
a small molecule inhibitor of DDX3
Considering the fact that DDX3 is overexpressed in
colorectal cancers, we evaluated the in vitro sensitivity of
colorectal cancer cells to DDX3 inhibition by RK-33, a small
molecule inhibitor of DDX3. Five colorectal cancer cell lines
(HCT116, HT29, DLD-1, SW480 and Colo205) were treated
with RK-33 and cell viability was assessed by an MTS assay
(Figure 4A-4B). All cell lines had an IC50 value in the low
micromolar range (3–7 μM). To assess whether RK-33 also
showed cytotoxicity in 3D cultures, we expanded our panel
with four patient-derived colorectal cancer spheroid cell
lines. Spheroid viability after RK-33 exposure was evaluated
with an arrayscan (Figure 4C-4E). The spheroids displayed
comparable sensitivity to RK-33 as the adherent cell lines
(IC50 value range 3–9 μM). Treatment with RK-33 resulted
in a G1 arrest in a dose-dependent manner in both HCT116
and HT29 (Figure 4F). An increase in the percentage of
apoptotic cells could also be observed in HCT116 after
DDX3 inhibition, but not in HT29 (Supplementary Figure 1).

Molecular predictors of DDX3 dependency
Centered on our finding of differential sensitivity
to RK-33, we hypothesized that sensitivity to RK-33 in
colorectal cancer cells may also be associated with other
genomic drivers of cellular transformation. Almost all
colorectal cell lines and spheroids expressed DDX3 protein
(Figure 4A and 4C), but no direct correlation between
RK-33 sensitivity and DDX3 expression levels was
observed. Next, we assessed the most commonly occurring
mutations in our cell line panel by next generation
sequencing (Table 3). Interestingly, we found that two
of the three RK-33 sensitive cell lines had wild-type

RK-33 sensitivity in relation to different
mutations in the Wnt-signaling pathway

APC and TP53, whereas the less sensitive group had
mutations in these genes.
To further determine if TP53 mutations in cell
lines alters sensitivity to RK-33, we compared RK-33
sensitivity in isogenic cell lines with wild-type TP53
(HCT116-p53+/+) and without TP53 (HCT116-p53−/−;
Figure 5A). Both cell lines were equally sensitive to DDX3
inhibition with RK-33 (IC50 2.52 vs 2.58 μM; Figure 5B).
In addition, similar to the parental cell line that expresses
p53 (Figure 1C), knockdown of DDX3 resulted in a G1
arrest (13.9% increase; p = 0.04) and a decrease of cells
in S-phase (4.8%; p = 0.11; Figure 5C-5D). This indicates
that within our experimental setting the sensitivity of
RK-33 is independent of p53 status.

Although DDX3 is thought to play a role in Wnt
signaling, cells that harbor an APC mutation were less
sensitive to RK-33 than cells with wild-type APC. Since
CTNNB1 and DDX3X mutations co-occur in Wnt-type
medulloblastomas [7–9], we hypothesized that DDX3
dependency may be higher in cells with other genetic
aberrations in the Wnt-signaling pathway, like mutations
in the gene encoding β-catenin. We used HCT116
cells with  either the wild-type allele deleted (HCT116
CTNNB1Δ45/−) or the mutant β-catenin allele deleted
(HCT116 CTNNB1−/wt) to study the contribution of each

BIRC5A. As seen in Figure 6C and Supplementary Table 1,
DDX3 knockdown resulted in reduced expression of
AXIN2, CCND1 and BIRC5A in HCT116. Similarly, a
decrease was observed in CCND1, c-MYC and BIRC5A
expression in HT29. RK-33 treatment also significantly
reduced the amount of transcripts of c-MYC, AXIN2,
CCND1 and BIRC5A in HCT116 (Figure 6D). Again this
result was slightly less profound in HT29, where RK-33
caused a reduction in AXIN2, CCND1 and BIRC5A.
Overall, inhibition of DDX3 results in decreased Wnt
signaling in HCT116 and to a lesser extent in HT29, which
corresponds to their relative dependence on DDX3 for cell
cycle progression.

allele to RK-33 sensitivity. Interestingly, we found that
cells with mutant β-catenin were slightly more sensitive
(IC50 2.68 μM) than those with only a wild-type allele
(IC50 3.71 μM) and that DDX3 expression is slightly
higher in HCT116 β-cateninΔ45/− cells (Figure 5D-5E).
These results indicate that APC wild-type colorectal
cancers harboring an activating CTNNB1 mutation may
be more sensitive to RK-33 treatment.

Inhibition of DDX3 results in reduced Wnt
signaling
To evaluate whether the observed proliferation
inhibition is the result of interference with oncogenic Wnt
signaling, we tested whether DDX3 inhibition causes a
reduction in TCF4-promoter activity with a reporter assay.
Knockdown of DDX3 resulted in a significant decrease in
Wnt signaling in HCT116 (42%, p = 0.001) and a small
decrease in HT29 (17%, p = 0.23; Figure 6A). RK-33
treatment resulted in an even greater inhibition of TCF4reporter activity of 74% in HCT116 (p = 0.0008) and of
44% in HT29 (p = 0.03; Figure 6B). To validate whether
the reduced TCF4-reporter activity also resulted in reduced
mRNA expression of TCF4-regulated genes, we quantified
transcript expression for c-MYC, AXIN2, CCND1 and

RK-33 treatment reduces DDX5 protein levels
Since DDX5 and DDX17 are known mediators of
Wnt signaling in colorectal cancer [10, 11] and DDX3
and DDX5 have been found to interact [12], we evaluated
whether RK-33 treatment also influences DDX5 and
DDX17 protein levels. Although we found earlier that
RK-33 does not bind directly to DDX5 [4], exposure to
RK-33 resulted in decreased DDX5 protein levels, but did
not affect DDX17 expression (Figure 7). This indicates
that the observed reduction in Wnt signaling could be

targeting DDX3 by RK-33 promotes cell death. [3, 4]
This requirement for DDX3 can in part be explained by its
involvement in Wnt signaling, as was shown previously by
our group and others. [4–6] As the majority of colorectal
cancers is driven by mutations in the Wnt-signaling
pathway, we explored the possible contribution of DDX3
to Wnt-associated colorectal cancer oncogenesis. In the
present study, we showed that DDX3 is overexpressed in

39% of colorectal cancers and that inhibition of DDX3
results in reduced Wnt signaling and a G1 arrest, making
DDX3 an attractive therapeutic target in these cancers.
The clinical relevance of the development of
Wnt signaling inhibitors which work in a constitutively
activated setting is tremendous, since mutations in the
Wnt-signaling pathway are not only the first genetic
alterations in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, but
advanced colorectal cancers with mutations in APC or
CTNNB1 remain dependent on upstream Wnt signaling
activity. [13, 14] Especially colorectal cancer stem cells
rely on Wnt signaling, and potent inhibition may therefore
specifically inhibit the resistant tumor initiating cell
population. [15] This potential is also reflected by the
cytotoxic effect of RK-33 on 3D cultures of colorectal
cancer stem cells in our study. Colorectal cancer drug
development is currently limited by a lack of pathway
specific targets, potential redundancy of pathway
components and toxicity. [16] In this study we show
that DDX3 is an integral component of Wnt signaling,
and targeting DDX3 by RK-33 is a potential therapeutic
option. Although previous mouse studies showed no
RK-33-related toxicity [4], future studies will need to
validate the anti-cancer activity of DDX3 inhibition in
in vivo models of colorectal cancer.
Apart from several studies finding an oncogenic
role of DDX3 in cancer [3, 4, 6, 17–22], others have
suggested that DDX3 may also have a tumor suppressive
role in certain cancers. [23–26] Although it is difficult to
explain these discrepancies by the molecular backgrounds
of different cancer types, it is possible that DDX3 levels
can differ between different subsets of patients within
a particular cancer. For example, we found high DDX3
expression to be associated with worse prognosis in
smoking patients with head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas, [27] whereas the opposite was observed in
non-smoking patients. [28] DDX3 inhibition resulted
in a reduction of proliferation in several colorectal cell
lines and all of the colorectal cancer cell lines used in this
study were susceptible to RK-33, pleading for reliance
of colorectal cancer cells on DDX3 for their survival and
arguing against a tumor suppressive role in this particular
setting. Interestingly, within our cohort of colorectal
cancer cell lines, we observed differential sensitivity to
RK-33, indicating that other genetic factors may contribute
to oncogenic addiction to DDX3 in neoplastic cells.
Personalized cancer therapy, in which the treatment
is adjusted to specific molecular characteristics of a
tumor, is of great promise for future cancer treatment.
The sensitivity to DDX3 inhibition with both RK-33
and siDDX3 was greatest in HCT116, closely followed
by HT29. SW480 and DLD-1 were less sensitive to
RK-33 and not affected by siDDX3 treatment. Within
our experimental setting, DDX3 dependency was
not necessarily reflected by absolute DDX3 protein
expression levels. This could be due to the fact that the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

levels of DDX3 essential to maintain cellular homeostasis
are variable in different colorectal cancer cells. Another
possibility is that in conjunction with DDX3, there could
be an association with other specific genetic alterations
that promotes RK-33 sensitivity. DDX3 dependency
seemed to be greater in the presence of wild-type APCstatus and activating mutations in CTNNB1. This finding
is in line with the co-occurrence of DDX3X and CTNNB1
mutations in medulloblastomas [7–9] and provides a
potential explanation for the fact that HT29, which harbors
a mutation in APC, does not show a clear G1 arrest upon
DDX3 knockdown. However, both our sample size and
the differences in RK-33 sensitivity were too small to be
able to make any definite claims with regard to predictors
of DDX3 dependency.
Different levels of interference have been suggested
for DDX3 in the Wnt-signaling pathway. In contrast with
our findings, Cruciat, et al. found that DDX3 inhibition
had no effect on Wnt signaling activity after induction
with β-catenin overexpression and that the involvement
of DDX3 in this pathway was independent of its helicase
activity. [5] It is possible that other mechanisms by which
DDX3 is involved in Wnt signaling, like stabilization
of β-catenin indirectly through Rac1-signaling [6] or
DDX5, or through a direct interaction with DDX3 [4]
are more prominent in colorectal cancers. Unfortunately,
only a minority of colorectal cancers (23%) falls into the
wild-type APC group. However, mutations in CTNNB1
are highly prevalent in hepatocellular carcinoma
(24%), sarcoma (44%) and testicular cancer(24%)
[29], suggesting that these cancers may potentially
have increased sensitivity to RK-33. In contrast to Sun
et al. who found DDX3 to be pro-apoptotic in a p53wildtype breast cancer cell line and anti-apoptotic in cell
lines harboring a p53-mutation [30], we found DDX3
dependency not to differ in the presence or absence of p53.
Overall, we conclude that a subset of colorectal
cancers is addicted to DDX3 expression. In these more
often APC-wild-type cancers, inhibition of DDX3 causes
a potent reduction of Wnt signaling and a G1 arrest.
DDX3 inhibition with the small molecule inhibitor
RK-33 is therefore a promising future treatment strategy
in colorectal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
HCT116, HT29, Colo205, SW480 and DLD-1
were a kind gift of Professor Fred Bunz (Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, MD, USA). The HCT116 p53 [31]
and β-catenin [32] knockout cell lines were kindly
provided by Professor Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins
University). All adherent colorectal cancer cell lines
were grown in McCoy’s 5A supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were routinely tested
28322

Oncotarget

for mycoplasma contamination by a PCR kit (30–1012K,
ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA).
The colosphere cultures CR9, CRC29, CRC47
and L145 were a kind gift from Professor Onno
Kranenburg (University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht,
The  Netherlands). These cell lines were established
from tumor specimens of primary colorectal cancers
(CR9, CRC29, CRC47) and colorectal cancer liver
metastases (L145). A detailed description of how these
colospheres were isolated and maintained has been
provided previously. [33] These specimens were obtained
in accordance with the ethical committee on human
experimentation and informed consent was obtained
from all patients. [33] Next generation sequencing was
performed to assess the mutation status of 50 commonly
mutated genes in these spheroids using the AmpliSeq
Cancer Hotpot Panel v2 (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) on an Ion PGM platform. Publicly available
mutation data of the adherent colorectal cancer cell
lines were accessed through the canSAR platform. [34]
Clinical information of these cell lines is summarized in
Supplementary Table 2.
DDX3 knockdown cell lines were generated by
transfecting cells with jetPrime transfection reagent
(Polyplus, New York, NY, USA) and 50 nM sicontrol
(non-targeting pool) or siDDX3 sequences (ONTARGETplus, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA).

per well in a 96-well plate. The amount of viable cells
per well was estimated every 24 hours by an MTS-assay
(CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution, Promega, Madison,
WI, USA). For this, the cells were incubated with MTS
reagent for 2 hours, after which absorbance was measured
at 490  nm with a Victor3V plate reader (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, USA).
For the cytotoxicity assays with adherent colorectal
cancer cell lines 2–5 × 103 cells were plated per well in
a 96-well plate. The following day RK-33 was added.
DMSO was added as a vehicle control. Read out occurred
after 72 hours of drug exposure with an MTS assay.
The cytotoxicity assays on colosphere cultures have
been described extensively elsewhere. [36] Briefly, 80–100
spheroids were plated per well in a 96-well plate with RK33 or DMSO. After 72 hours of drug exposure the total
cell population was labelled with DRAQ5™ (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) and live cells were labelled with Calcein
Green AM (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Fluorescence was measured using a Cellomics Arrayscan
VTI HCS Reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA).
The percentage of dead cells was calculated by normalizing
the levels of intensity to and expressed as a relative
percentage of the plate-averaged vehicle treated control.

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed as was
described previously. [37] In short, for siDDX3
experiments 5–15 × 104 cells were plated per well in a
6-well plate. The following day cells were transfected
with sicontrol or siDDX3 and incubated for 72 hours.
For experiments with RK-33 4–7.5 × 105 cells were
plated in a 6-well plate. The following day cells were
incubated for 24 hours with RK-33. Subsequently, cells
were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at
−20°C. Fixed  cells were incubated in DNA staining
solution (5 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.5mg/ml RNAse
A) for 1 hour. Cell cycle acquisition was performed on a
FACScan I or FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA). Data was analyzed using FlowJo
software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). Statistical
significance was assessed with a student’s t-test.

Immunoblotting
All cells were harvested at 50–70% confluency.
For DDX3 knockdown experiments cells were harvested
72 hours after transfection. For RK-33 experiments
cells were harvested after 24 hours exposure to the drug
or vehicle control. For whole cellular protein extracts
cells were lysed in SDS-extraction buffer (100nM TrisHCl, 2% SDS, 12% glycerol, 10mM EDTA, pH6.7)
and sonicated on ice. 30 μg protein was loaded on 10%
SDS-PAGE gels. After gel-electrophoresis proteins were
transferred onto PVDF membranes, blocked with 5% milk
and probed overnight with primary antibodies against
DDX3 (1:1000,  mAb AO196) [35], Actin (1:10000,
A5441, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), DDX5
(1:1000, pab204, EMD Millipore, Billarica, MA, USA),
DDX17 (1:1000, Bethyl, Montgomery, TX, USA) and p53
(1:1000, DO-1, Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX,
USA) and followed by appropriate secondary antibodies.
The blots were developed with clarity western ECL (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and imaged with G:BOX Chemi
XR5 (Syngene, Frederick, MD, USA).

TCF-reporter assays
Transcriptional activity of TCF4 was measured
using the dual luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For
this, cells were transfected with 500 ng TOP-FLASH or
FOP-FLASH constructs [38] and 50 ng phRL Renilla
constructs as transfection controls, using jetPrime
transfection reagent (Polyplus, New York, NY, USA).
Luminescence was measured using a luminometer
(Berthold Sirius, Oak Ridge, TN, USA).
For the experiments with RK-33 3–4 × 104 HCT116
and HT29 cells were plated in a 24-well plate. After

Proliferation assay and cytotoxicity assays
For the proliferation assays 4–10 × 104 cells were
plated in a 24-well plate. The following day the cells were
transfected with siDDX3 or sicontrol as described earlier.
48 hours after transfection 2–5 × 103 cells were plated

24 hours the cells were transfected with the TOP/FOP
constructs. 7 hours after transfection 2.5 μM RK-33 or
DMSO was added for 12–24 hours after which the cells
were lysed. For the DDX3 knockdown experiments
12.5–15  ×  103 HCT116 and HT29 cells were plated in
a 24-well plate. In the evening of the following day the
cells were transfected with 50 nM siDDX3 as described
earlier. The following morning the cells were transfected
with the TOP/FOP constructs and incubated for another
48 hours after which the cells were lysed for the luciferase
assay. Relative TCF4-promotor activity was calculated by
normalizing TOP-FLASH and FOP-FLASH readings for
Renilla luciferase readings and dividing normalized TOPFLASH readings by normalized FOP-FLASH readings.
Statistical significance was evaluated by a paired t-test.

approval is required according to Dutch legislation. [41]
Anonymous or coded use of redundant tissue for research
purposes is part of the standard treatment agreement with
patients in our hospitals. [42]

Immunohistochemistry
4 μm sections were cut, mounted on SuperFrost
slides (Menzel&Glaeser, Brunswick, Germany),
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in decreasing
ethanol dilutions. For DDX3 staining, endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked with 1.5% hydrogen
peroxide buffer for 15 minutes and was followed by
antigen retrieval by boiling for 20 minutes in 10 mM
citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Slides were subsequently incubated
in a humidified chamber for 1 hour with anti-DDX3
(1:1000, pAb r647). [35] After washing with PBS, slides
were incubated with poly-HRP-anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG
(Brightvision, Immunologic, Duiven, The Netherlands) as
a secondary antibody for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Peroxidase activity was developed with diaminobenzidine
and hydrogen peroxide substrate solution for 10 minutes.
The slides were lightly counterstained with haematoxylin
and mounted. Positive controls (tonsil) were used
throughout. Negative controls were obtained by omission
of the primary antibodies from the staining procedure.
β-catenin staining was performed automatically
with the Leica BOND RX (Leica Microsystems,
Rijswijk, The Netherlands). Antigens were retrieved
with Epitope Retrieval Solution 2. The primary antibody
against β-catenin (clone 17C2, Novocastra, Eindhoven,
The Netherlands) was used in a 1:20 concentration.
Scoring was performed by consensus of two
observers (M.H.v.V., P.v.D.). Intensity of cytoplasmic
DDX3 expression was scored semi-quantitatively as
being absent, low, moderate or strong. The TMAs
included multiple cores per patient; the highest score was
used for further analysis. Cases with absent to moderate
scores were classified as having low DDX3 expression
and evaluated against cases with strong expression.
Intratumoral DDX3 expression was compared to that
of the surrounding normal tissue in case the latter was
available for comparison.
β-catenin expression was scored separately for each
subcellular compartment. Membrane expression was
scored as complete, partial or lost. Cytoplasmic expression
was scored as normal or overexpressed. The percentage of
positive nuclei was scored. A cut-off of lower or higher
than 10% was used for analysis.
Clinicopathological characteristics were compared
between DDX3 low and high expressing tumors. Discrete
variables were compared by χ2 or Fisher’s exact test and
odds ratios (OR) were calculated with 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI). Statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS version 20.0.

Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction
HCT116 and HT29 cells were harvested after 12–24
hour exposure to RK-33 or 72 hours after transfection with
50 nM siDDX3. RNA was extracted with an RNeasy kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and cDNA was manufactured
using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA), followed by qPCR using SYBR green (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) on an CFX96 Real-Time
PCR detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Amplification of 36B4, a housekeeping gene, was used for
normalizing gene expression values. Primer sequences:
DDX3 F 5′-GGAGGAAGTACAGCCAGCAAAG-3′,
DDX3 R 5′-CTGCCAATGCCATCGTAATCACTC-3′,
AXIN2 F 5‘-TCAAGTGCAAACTTTCGCCAACC-3′,
AXIN2 R 5′-TAGCCAGAACCTATGTGATAAGG-3′,

CCND1 R 5′-TGGCACAGAGGGCAACGA-3′, BIRC5A
F 5′-CCACCGCATCTCTACATTCA-3′, BIRC5A R
5′-TATGTTCCTCTATGGGGTCG-3′. Fold changes in
mRNA expression were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCT method.
Statistical significance was calculated by performing
a paired student’s t-test on the ΔCT values. [39]

Patient samples
A tissue microarray (TMA’s) with samples from
72 colorectal cancer patients from the Academic Medical
Center, Amsterdam was kindly provided by professor
Johan Offerhaus (University Medical Center Utrecht).
This TMA also included one punch of surrounding normal
mucosa per patient. The construction of this TMA has been
reported in detail elsewhere. [40] An additional TMA with
292 colorectal cancer samples from Paderborn, Germany
was provided by prof. Horst Bürger.
