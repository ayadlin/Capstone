BACKGROUND: Patients aged >10 years with rhabdomyosarcoma have an inferior outcome compared with patients
ages 1 to 9 years, which may be explained by toxicities (adverse events [AEs]) that result in chemotherapy dose
reductions. METHODS: AEs observed during 1 of 3 randomized chemotherapy regimens (vincristine, dactinomycin,
and cyclophosphamide [VAC]; vincristine, dactinomycin, and ifosfamide [VAI]; or vincristine, ifosfamide, and etoposide [VIE]) in the Fourth Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study were recorded. The incidence of toxicities by age and
treatment regimen was determined. The odds of developing AEs in a particular age group (ages 5-9 years, 10-14
years, and 15-20 years) were compared with the odds in the control group of patients ages 1 to 4 years. RESULTS: In
total, 657 patients were eligible for analysis. The estimated 5-year event-free survival rates were 78%, 83%, 67%, and
58% for the groups ages 1 to 4 years, 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, and 15 to 20 years, respectively. Patients ages 15 to
20 years experienced less neutropenia (odds ratio [OR], 0.43; P < .0001), thrombocytopenia (OR, 0.41; P < .0001),
anemia (OR, 0.34; P < .0001), and infection (OR, 0.41; P < .0001) compared with younger patients, although they
received similar amounts of chemotherapy. In contrast, peripheral nervous system toxicity was higher in adolescents
aged >10 years (OR, 4.18; P < .0001). Females experienced more neutropenia (OR, 1.28; P ¼ .05) and thrombocytopenia (OR, 1.26; P ¼ .06) compared with males. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents who received treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma experienced significantly less hematologic toxicity and more peripheral nervous system toxicity compared with
younger children despite receiving similar amounts of chemotherapy. Although outcomes were inferior in adolescents, it was unclear whether the differences in toxicity observed in the current study had an impact on outcome.
The authors concluded that future studies examining the age-related and sex-related differences in pharmacokinetics

INTRODUCTION

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and adolescents. The cure

rates for patients with nonmetastatic RMS have improved significantly from an estimated 25% in 1970 to 75% today.1
This improvement in outcome is largely because of the systematic use of multimodal therapy, including surgery, radiation
therapy, and chemotherapy, administered within the context of large cooperative group trials.1-4 In the setting of modern
therapy, age at diagnosis is an important, independent prognostic factor, and patients aged >10 years fare worse compared
with patients between ages 1 years and 10 years.5,6 A recent analysis from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results

Toxicity of IRS Therapy by Age/Gupta et al

Figure 1. The treatment plan for the Fourth Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study is illustrated. Patients received sodium mercaptoethanesulfonate at 360 mg/m2 per dose 15 minutes before ifosfamide (I) or at 450 mg/m2 per dose before cyclophosphamide (C) and every 3 hours for 3 days after each I or C administration. Chemotherapy doses were reduced by 50% in patients
aged <1 year, if tolerated (nadir absolute neutrophil count, <500 neutrophils/mL; platelet count, >50,000 platelets/mL), and
were increased to 75% and then to 100%. VAC indicates vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide; VAI, vincristine, dactinomycin, and ifosfamide; VIE, vincristine, ifosfamide, and etoposide; V, vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 (2-mg maximum); A, dactinomycin

(SEER) registry confirmed the poor outcome of adults
(aged >19 years) with nonpleomorphic RMS compared
with children.7 Furthermore, adolescents and young adult
patients with other cancers also reportedly have inferior
clinical outcomes compared with younger pediatric
patients.8,9 The reasons for these differences are not
known, although they probably are multifactorial (for
review, see Veal et al10). One possible reason for the inferior outcome observed in adolescents with RMS may be a
higher incidence of adverse events (AEs), resulting in dose
modifications and consequently less total delivered therapy. To address this hypothesis, we evaluated the total
chemotherapy delivered and AEs in patients with RMS
ages 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, and 15 to 20 years compared with younger children ages 1 to 4 years who were
treated on the Fourth Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma
Study (IRS-IV).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We reviewed toxicity data from 657 patients who were
treated on IRS-IV; the details of their treatment and outcomes have been published previously.4 Most patients

ease were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 chemotherapy regimens delivered over the initial 28 weeks: 1) vincristine,
dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC); 2) vincristine, dactinomycin, and ifosfamide (VAI); or 3) vincristine, ifosfamide, and etoposide (VIE). All patients
received VAC for an additional 14 weeks. (Fig. 1) The
doses of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide were 2.2 g/m2
for 1 day per cycle and 1.8 g/m2 daily for 5 days, respectively, both given with sodium mercaptoethanesulfonate.
The dose of dactinomycin was 0.015 mg/kg daily for 5
days intravenously (maximum dose, 0.5 mg), and the
dose of vincristine was 1.5 mg/m2 intravenously (maximum dose, 2 mg). Patients with pre-existing renal abnormalities that predisposed them to potential
nephrotoxicity (hydronephrosis, single kidney, or abovenormal serum creatinine for age) were assigned nonrandomly to VAC to avoid exposure to potential ifosfamideinduced nephrotoxicity, and these patients were excluded
from the current analysis. For patients on the VAI or VIE
treatment regimens, the total dose of ifosfamide was limited to 72 g/m2 to reduce renal toxicity. Patients received
radiation therapy according to their IRS group, most often at week 9 of the protocol. The use of granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor (G-CSF) was encouraged but was
not mandatory and, accordingly, was not systematically

recorded. The total dose of chemotherapy delivered in
milligrams was calculated as a percentage of the dose prescribed by the protocol for each reporting period.
Statistical Considerations
The rate of various AEs was modeled as a function of
patient age (in 4 categories: ages 1-4 years, 5-9 years, 1014 years, and 15-20 years), sex, and treatment/reporting
periods (3 treatments [VAC, VAI, VIE] and 4 reporting
periods [protocol weeks 0-8, 9-19, 20-28 and 29-47]; 12
categories) using generalized estimating equations and
accounting appropriately for the correlation of the occurrence of specific AEs in the same patient over the 4 reporting periods. The 4 age categories were chosen because the
outcomes differ between these 4 cohorts. From the modeling results, estimates of the odds of experiencing the AE in
various age categories (compared with the baseline age
group [ages 1-4 years]), by sex, and in various reporting
periods (compared with the baseline [first] reporting period [protocol weeks 0-8]) could be calculated. We were
also able to assess differences in the risk of experiencing an
AE in a specific reporting period by treatment (VAC,
VAI, VIE).
Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time
from study entry to the first occurrence of progression,
relapse after response, or death from any cause. Patients
who did not experience an event were censored at their
last follow-up. EFS distributions were estimated using
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis11 and were compared
using the log-rank test.12 A Cox proportional hazards

of various factors to the risk of experiencing a protocol

RESULTS
Patient Demographics
The demographics of patients included in this analysis are
summarized in Table 1. The total dose of each chemotherapy agent (calculated as the percentage of total dose
delivered in milligrams per dose intended) was similar
across age groups, treatment regimens, specific agents,
and reporting periods. However, there were lower median
doses of vincristine in the fourth reporting period for
patients aged >10 years. Table 2 lists the absolute incidence of AEs in each of the 4 reporting periods.

Adverse Events
Neutropenia

Lower rates of neutropenia were observed in the second and third reporting periods for all patients compared
with the first reporting period (Table 2). In the first 3
reporting periods, less neutropenia was observed with the
VAI and VIE regimens compared that observed with the
VAC regimen for all age groups. Patients ages 10 to 15
years and ages 15 to 20 years had lower levels of neutropenia compared with other age groups (Table 3). Female
patients experienced more neutropenia (odds ratio [OR],
1.28; P ¼ .05) compared with male patients, and this difference was independent of age category.

Anemia

Lower rates of anemia were observed in the second,
third, and fourth reporting periods compared with the
first reporting period (Table 2). Significantly lower rates
of anemia were observed for patients ages 10 to 14 years
and ages 15 to 20 years (Table 3). Somewhat more anemia
was observed with the VAI and VIE regimens in the first
reporting period, and somewhat more anemia was
observed among these patients in the fourth reporting period when they received VAC. There was no difference in
the rate of anemia between male and female patients.
To summarize, less neutropenia and anemia were
observed in the second, third, and fourth reporting periods, whereas more thrombocytopenia was observed in
these periods. Patients aged >10 years and male patients
generally experienced less hematologic toxicity.
Infection

Infection rates did not vary over the 4 reporting periods (Table 2). Patients ages 10 to 14 years and ages 15 to
20 years had statistically significantly lower rates of infections (Table 3). Lower rates of infections were observed
for the VAI and VIE regimens in the third reporting period compared with the rates observed for the VAC regimen in all age groups.
Peripheral nervous system toxicity

Significantly more peripheral nervous system (PNS)
toxicity was observed in the second and third reporting
periods (Table 2). Rates of PNS toxicity were higher in
patients ages 5 to 9 years and were much higher in those
ages 10 to 14 years and ages 15 to 20 years (Table 3). Significantly higher rates of PNS toxicity were observed for
all patients who were randomized to the VAI and VIE regimens in the forth reporting period when they received
VAC.
Mucositis

Thrombocytopenia

Statistically significantly higher rates of thrombocytopenia were observed in the third and fourth reporting
periods (Table 2) for all patients. Similar to neutropenia,
lower rates of thrombocytopenia were observed with the
VAI and VIE regimens in reporting periods 1 through 3
compared with the VAC regimen for all groups. Patients
ages 15 to 20 years had lower levels of thrombocytopenia
compared with other age groups (Table 3). Female
patients experienced more thrombocytopenia (OR, 1.26;
P ¼ .06) compared with male patients.
Cancer

February 15, 2012

Lower rates of mucositis were experienced in the second, third, and fourth reporting periods compared with
the first reporting period (Table 2). Significantly higher
rates of mucositis were experienced by older patients ages
5 to 9 years and ages 10 to 14 years compared with children ages 1 to 4 years (Table 3). Treatment with VIE
appeared to cause less mucositis than VAC and VAI in the
first 3 reporting periods.
Outcome
At a median follow-up of 7.7 years, the estimated EFS
for all IRS-IV randomized patients was 75% (95%

1133

Original Article

confidence interval [CI], 72%-78%). Factors that predicted EFS in univariate analysis included age (P < .001),
stage (P < .001), IRS group (P < .001), pathologic subtype (P < .001), and primary disease site (P < .001).
Because almost all patients received the prescribed chemotherapy dose, this was not included as a variable in the
analysis of EFS. In multivariate analysis, age, stage, IRS
group, and pathologic subtype retained statistically significant associations with EFS. The estimated 5-year EFS by
age was 78% for ages 1 to 4 years, 83% for ages 5 to 9
years, 67% for ages 10 to 14 years, and 58% for age 15
years. There was no difference in EFS by sex (data not
shown).

DISCUSSION
Adolescents with RMS had inferior disease-related outcomes and different patterns of chemotherapy-induced
toxicity compared with younger children. Adolescents
aged >10 years experienced significantly less myelosuppression and more peripheral nervous system toxicity
compared with children aged <10 years. Age is a well
known and robust prognostic factor in childhood RMS,
and adolescents consistently fare worse than younger children irrespective of histology or tumor site.5,6 We examined whether the tolerance to prescribed therapy, as
measured by AEs and the percentage of planned chemotherapy dose delivered, could explain the observed difference in outcome. Surprisingly, adolescents experienced
significantly less hematologic toxicity compared with
younger children despite receiving a comparable cumulative chemotherapy dose. Therefore, dose modifications in
response to toxicity do not explain the age-related difference in outcome. Rather, the lower degree of hematologic
toxicity observed in adolescents may reflect relatively
lower systemic exposure to chemotherapy.
Dosing guidelines for anticancer therapy often are
guided by a balance of efficacy and toxicity profiles; and,
for cytotoxic agents, the dose often is escalated until an acceptable level of myelosuppression is achieved. It has been
demonstrated that the degree of myelosuppression after
chemotherapy is correlated with outcome in certain diseases and may be sex-specific. An analysis of the EUROEwing 99 protocol, which included 851 children and
adults with Ewing sarcoma who received vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (VIDE) chemotherapy,
demonstrated that increasing age was associated with significantly less toxicity.13 The same study also indicated
that male sex was associated with less toxicity. In a recent

1134

exploratory analysis of the national Australian cancer registry, it was reported that the relapse-free survival of adolescents and young adults with cancer was sex-specific, with
males faring worse than females among patients with
Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma,
and this difference was correlated with the degree of myelosuppression.14 Females with Ewing sarcoma achieved a
lower nadir in neutrophil count compared with males after
the first cycle of combined ifosfamide, vincristine, actinomycin D/VAC chemotherapy (0.94  0.64 cells/mm3 vs
2.24  1.08 cells/mm3, respectively). Similar sex-specific
patterns were not observed in RMS or in children aged
<15 years.14 In a large retrospective analysis from the
German Hodgkin Study Group, a higher prevalence of
severe leukopenia (grade 3/4) during chemotherapy was
correlated with better survival among female patients.15
Furthermore, the few male patients who also experienced
severe leukopenia had a better outcome than their counterparts without severe leukopenia.15 In a cohort of women
who received combined cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
and 5-fluorouracil for breast cancer, those who experienced at least 1 episode of grade 3/4 neutropenia had a
better survival outcome compared with those who did not
(P ¼ .006).16 Furthermore, myelosuppression remained
significant (P ¼ .05) even when analyzed in a multivariate
Cox proportional model with other known prognostic factors. In our analysis, female patients were more likely to
experience neutropenia; however, sex did not influence
EFS. It is conceivable that the minimal myelosuppression
observed in adolescents in the IRS-IV study reflects a relative inadequacy of alkylating agent, possibly contributing
to an inferior outcome in this age group.
On the basis of these observations, it is possible that
escalating the dose of alkylating agent in adolescents with
intermediate-risk RMS would improve survival; however,
data to date do not support this hypothesis. The dose of
cyclophosphamide has increased significantly in successive IRS/Children’s Oncology Group (COG) trials from
approximately 0.9 g/m2 per course during IRS-III17 to
2.2 g/m2 per course during IRS-IV to achieve equivalent
hematologic toxicity with the ifosfamide-containing
arms: VAI and VIE.4 The total cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide was 26.4 g/m2 for those randomized to
VAC alone. However, no improvement in failure-free survival (FFS) for either intermediate-risk embryonal RMS
(3-year FFS: 74% on IRS-III vs 75% on IRS-IV; P ¼ .47)
or intermediate-risk alveolar RMS (3-year FFS: 70% on
IRS-III vs 64% on IRS-IV; P ¼ .35) was observed despite
the escalation of cyclophosphamide cumulative dose and

dose intensity.4,18 The same cyclophosphamide dose per
course (2.2 g/m2) was maintained during COG study
D9803.19 The total dose of cyclophosphamide on the
VAC regimen in D9803 was 30.8 g/m2 compared with
25.1 g/m2 on the VAC/vincristine, topotecan, and cyclophosphamide (VTC) regimen, and the VAC/VTC regimen contained 20% less cyclophosphamide. Despite the
lower total cyclophosphamide dose on the VAC/VTC
regimen, the outcome of patients was similar to that on
IRS-IV and on the VAC regimen in the current study.
Furthermore, cyclophosphamide dose escalation may be
implicated in the severe hepatopathy observed in very
young children during both IRS-IV and D9803.20,21 In
all of these studies, the impact of cyclophosphamide dose
on FFS was not specifically analyzed by age in patients
ages >10 years to 15 years.
Because of the aforementioned short-term toxicity
of alkylating agent, long-term gonadotoxicity, and the
lack of improvement in FFS with higher doses, the current
series of COG RMS studies used a cyclophosphamide
dose of 1.2 g/m2 per course for all patients. The experimental arm of the current COG intermediate-risk RMS
trial (ARST0531) replaces half of the VAC courses with
vincristine and irinotecan cycles, resulting in a total cumulative dose of 8.4 g/m2 of cyclophosphamide compared
with 16.4 g/m2 in the VAC arm. We will await the results
from that study to determine whether the addition of irinotecan is sufficient to rescue adolescents from this
reduced dose of cyclophosphamide.
The dose of alkylating agent has been escalated
unsuccessfully in other sarcoma studies. For example,
increasing cyclophosphamide dose intensification from
1.2 g/m2 per dose daily for 3 days to 1.8 g/m2 per dose (a
64% increase to 3.6 g/m2 per cycle) in patients with intermediate-risk RMS did not improve survival.22 However,
of 91 patients who received treatment, there were only 20
patients (22%) aged >10 years, and outcome was not analyzed by age in that study. A German study examined the
replacement of cyclophosphamide with ifosfamide and
etoposide in standard chemotherapy for high-risk, localized RMS and observed no improvement in survival,
although the comparison was with nonrandomized historical controls.23 A randomized study in localized Ewing
sarcoma also failed to demonstrate a benefit of escalating
the dose intensity of alkylating agent.24
Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug that undergoes a
complicated process of metabolic activation and inactivation.25 In a population of pediatric patients with neuroblastoma, considerable interpatient variability was

Cancer

February 15, 2012

observed in the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide
and 2 of its metabolites, hydroxycyclophosphamide and
carboxyethylphosphoramide mustard.26 In a study of
adult patients who underwent allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation, it also was observed that cyclophosphamide metabolism varied and was age dependent, but it
was not correlated with disease-related outcome.27 It is
noteworthy that a recent study examined the personalized
administration of cyclophosphamide for pretransplantation conditioning based on kinetics of an initial dose;
patients with individualized dosing experienced less nephrotoxicity and no difference in disease-related outcome.28
Examination of pharmacokinetic differences in alkylating
agent metabolism by age, and possibly by sex, in patients
with RMS is worth considering.
Lower rates of mucositis were experienced in the second, third, and fourth reporting periods compared with
the first reporting period, probably because of early radiation therapy administered to the majority of patients
(63%) with parameningeal tumors in the first reporting
period.29 Mucositis was relatively more common in children aged >5 years, which may reflect under-reporting of
this symptom in young children.30,31
Adolescents had significantly worse PNS toxicity
compared with younger children, which is in keeping with
differential drug clearance based on size.32 Vincristine and
vinorelbine clearance is more rapid in children than in
adults, in which these agents have a greater than 2-fold longer terminal half-life.33 However, a more recent study
failed to demonstrate a difference in vincristine pharmacokinetics between children and adolescents ages 1.3 to 17.3
years.34 Weekly vincristine has been the backbone of IRS
therapy for RMS and is based on impressive response rates
to single agents observed both historically and in preclinical
models.35 To our knowledge, the relative importance of
weekly vincristine in the context of modern therapy, which
includes aggressive local control measures for all ages and
histologies of RMS, has not been addressed. From our
data, we were unable to determine the exact dose modifications for vincristine in older adolescents; however, the total
cumulative delivered dose did not differ significantly compared with that received by younger children. It is worth
noting that, because of capping of vincristine as dictated by
the protocol, all patients with a body surface area >1.3 m2
received 2 mg of vincristine. Effectively, this results in relative under dosing of larger adolescents compared with
younger children. The International Society of Pediatric
Oncology Malignant Mesenchymal Tumor study MMT89 does not include weekly vincristine as part of therapy,

and the overall survival results have been somewhat similar
to those reported in IRS-IV, albeit with other major differences in therapy.36,37 A recent analysis from the COG confirms that, despite lower total cumulative dose by body size
(because of dose capping at 2 mg), adolescents experience
greater vincristine-related neurotoxicity compared with
younger children.38
Our analysis is limited by the nonstandarized use of
G-CSF, which may have contributed to differences in
myelosuppression observed, because not all patients
received the drug. However, there is no reason to believe
that the receipt of G-CSF was age-dependent. Furthermore, anemia and thrombocytopenia rates also were lower
in the older patients, suggesting that variable use of GCSF is unlikely to explain the lower frequency of hematologic toxicity in older patients. Radiation-related toxicities
were not compared by age, which may be especially important with the variation of histology and primary tumor
site in adolescence; this could be addressed in a future confirmatory study. To address these limitations, a similar
toxicity analysis currently is underway for patients treated
on the more recent intermediate-risk RMS study, D9803,
to confirm the IRS-IV findings.
We have demonstrated that adolescents with RMS
experienced significantly less hematologic toxicity compared with younger children on IRS-IV, although they
received a similar cumulative dose of drug. Thus, differences in drug handling may contribute to their poor outcome, which may be affected by sex and/or age. COG soft
tissue sarcoma investigators currently are studying the
age-dependent pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide.
Therapeutic strategies that may be reasonable for younger
children may not be extrapolated directly to adolescents.
Future study designs should focus on individualizing the
dose of alkylating agent based on differences in drug handling to improve the survival of adolescents with RMS.
