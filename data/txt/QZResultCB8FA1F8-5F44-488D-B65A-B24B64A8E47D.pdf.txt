ABSTRACT:
Genetic and epigenetic events within a cell which promote a block in normal
development or differentiation coupled with unregulated proliferation are hallmarks
of neoplastic transformation. Differentiation therapy involves the use of agents with
the ability to induce differentiation in cells that have lost this ability, i.e. cancer
cells. The promise of differentiation-based therapy as a viable treatment modality
is perhaps best characterized by the addition of retinoids in the treatment of acute
promyelocytic leukemia (APML) revolutionizing the management of APML and
dramatically improving survival. However, interest and application of differentiationbased therapy for the treatment of solid malignancies have lagged due to deficiencies
in our understanding of differentiation pathways in solid malignancies. Over the past
decade, a differentiation-based developmental model for solid tumors has emerged
providing insights into the biology of various solid tumors as well as identification
of targetable pathways capable of re-activating blocked terminal differentiation
programs. Furthermore, a variety of agents including retinoids, histone deacetylase
inhibitors (HDACI), PPARγ agonists, and others, currently in use for a variety of
malignancies, have been shown to induce differentiation in solid tumors. Herein we
discuss the relevancy of differentiation-based therapies in solid tumors, using soft
tissue sarcomas (STS) as a biologic and clinical model, and review the preclinical data
to support its role as a promising modality of therapy for the treatment of solid tumors.

INTRODUCTION

long standing drawback of differentiation therapy has been
its practical and theoretical disadvantage as compared
to novel and even conventional cytotoxic approaches.
Cytotoxic chemotherapy aims directly at cancer cell death
while differentiation therapy alludes to a more complex
and more nebulous process of cancer to normal tissue
transitioning.
However, if there is one thing we have learned
over the last 50 years of treating cancer patients, it is that
conventional approaches (e.g., conventional cytotoxic
agents, targeted antibodies or small molecule inhibitors)
are not sufficient in effecting cures for a significant
proportion of cancer patients. According to the American
Cancer Society register, this year more than 500,000
Americans will die of cancer accounting for nearly 1 of
every 4 deaths [3]. And, while the 5-year survival rate for
all patients diagnosed with cancer in the last ten years is

Differentiation therapy is a therapeutic modality
aimed at re-activating endogenous differentiation
programs in cancer cells with subsequent tumor cellular
maturation and concurrent loss of the tumor phenotype. In
modern literature, one can trace the conceptual origins of
differentiation therapy to the work of G. Barry Pierce who
posited that malignant cells could differentiate into nonmalignant cells [1, 2]. Although a theoretically attractive
option, differentiation therapy has historically been greatly
hampered by both our practical lack of understanding of
the biology of normal differentiation pathways as well as
by our theoretical inability to envision a methodology that
could restore or supersede a tumor’s immutable genetic
level mutations which result in the lineage specific block
to differentiation and subsequent tumorigenesis. Another

66%, up from the 50% rate of the 1970s [3], that means,
as of today, one out of every three patients diagnosed with
cancer will not be alive five years later. Clearly there is
reason to pursue all potential therapeutic options.
However, is differentiation therapy a “realistic”
potential therapeutic option? Is it really possible to
make cancer – “normal”? In the era before retinoic acidbased differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic
leukemia (APML), through the use of various cytotoxic
chemotherapies the remission rates had progressively
improved from 50 to 80%, of which only about 35% could
expect to be long term survivals. However, now with the
use of retinoic acid and chemotherapy more than 90% of
patients with newly diagnosed APML patients can achieve
complete remission and about 75% can be cured [4-13].
Mechanistically, APML cells in the vast majority of
patients have a characteristic chromosomal translocation
t(15;17) that produces the fusion gene consisting of the
promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and retinoic acid receptor
α (RARα) genes. PML-RARα retains critical domains of
PML and RARα, and plays a key role in the pathogenesis
of APML by recruiting transcriptional repressors, histone
deacetylases (HDACs), and DNA methyltransferases.
Pharmacological doses of ATRA trigger dissociation of
PML-RARα/HDAC complexes resulting in degradation
of PML-RARα and resumption of myeloid differentiation
in APML cells [14]. Explained in the above manner – the
use of retinoic acid to “relieve” the differentiation block
makes complete sense.
So why aren’t there more examples of differentiation
therapy? For hematopoietic malignancies it has been
argued that APML represents an isolated example of a
“simple karyotype” disease that is both addicted to the
characteristic fusion gene for tumorigenicity and has
minimal other genetic abnormalities. Thus, the reversal
of one pathway is sufficient to reverse the tumorigenicity
of APML and place it back on the road to normal
differentiation, something that is unlikely to be true for
other hematopoietic malignancies. For solid tumors, the
application of differentiation therapy has been further
compounded by the absence of developmental models
of cancer progression that correlate cancer subtypes to
stages of normal development. Models such as those
proposed by Pierce and colleagues have been historically
minimized in favor of the more common notions of solid
tumorigenesis which hypothesize that mutations occurring
in “normal” tissue results in gradual dedifferentiation to
cancer cells harboring features of normal tissue reflecting
varying degrees of differentiation – a feature invariably
linked to cancer aggressiveness [15]. Therefore, even the
consideration of differentiation-based therapy in solid
tumors has been hampered by the lack of developmentalbased classifications of solid tumors.
In this review, we discuss how recent advances in
the developmental-based classification of solid tumors are
paving the way and leading to novel differentiation-based

therapies for solid tumors.

Differentiation-based classification models of
cancer
Similar to other solid tumors, sarcomas have been
historically classified based on histopathological features
reflecting the degree to which these tumors resemble
normal tissue. However, unlike other solid tumors, the
existence of a connective tissue (mesenchymal) stem cell,
along with in vitro methodologies to differentiate them into
mature tissues, have allowed us, for the first time, to query
whether sarcoma subtypes arise as a result of cellular
transformation at discrete stages of differentiation [16].
Through gene clustering and distance correlation analyses,
our group was able to correlate the expression signatures
of each liposarcoma subtype to a corresponding point
along the adipocytic differentiation time course providing
evidence that the dedifferentiated and pleomorphic
liposarcoma subtypes represent cells arrested at an early
point in differentiation compared to myxoid/round-cell
and well-differentiated cells which arrest at later and
more mature stages of development. Furthermore, our
analysis of differentially expressed genes identified genes
marking discrete stages of adipocytic differentiation
and discriminating these genes from markers that may
be involved in malignant transformation and potentially
amenable to therapeutic targeting. Picking up on this
theme, and using significantly advanced computational
methodologies, Riester and colleagues recently developed
a statistical algorithm utilizing gene expression data from
different cancers (including AML, breast carcinoma
and liposarcoma) to construct phylogenetic trees which
objectively and systematically categorized cancer
subtypes based on degrees of maturation and relative
to their corresponding cells of origin (e.g. hMSC for
liposarcomas) [17]. The algorithm proposed successfully
classified: (1) the AML subtypes in accord with the FAB
classification schema (e.g. M0 subtype was arrayed closest
to stem cells); (2) breast carcinoma based on estrogen
receptor (ER) status; and (3) confirmed our initial findings
in liposarcomas as described above. This developmentalbased approach represents not only a new method for
reclassifying solid tumors, but also provides fundamental
insight into solid tumor etiology.

Targeting of differentiation pathways
Along with the changing classification systems
that now plot solid tumors onto developmental maps,
we are getting better at understanding how to activate
differentiation pathways in cancers so as to progress
them along their developmental paths. Using this
rationale, we have previously shown that mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) are the progenitors of malignant

fibrous histiocytoma (MFH; now termed high grade
undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma [HGUPS], a
commonly diagnosed mesenchymal tumor) and that
increased levels of DKK1, a Wnt developmental pathway
inhibitor, mediate the transition from the MSC state to
the MFH state [18]. Perhaps, more importantly, we have
been able to demonstrate that MFH cells in which Wnt
signaling is re-established to mirror the MSC-state become
amenable to differentiation into mature connective tissue
lineages with concurrent loss of tumor cell properties [18].
Although a novel finding at the time, if one looks closely
enough, there are many agents already in clinical practice
that may function as differentiation agents.

differentiation following treatment with the histone
deacetylase inihibitor (HDACI), trichostatin A [27].
Rephaeli and colleagues showed that treatment of mice
with established 22Rv1 prostate tumors with AN-7,
a prodrug of butyric acid, resulted in AN-7-treated
tumors being uniformly positive for PSA -indicative
of differentiation [28]. Martirosyan and colleagues
showed that five quinoline compounds based compounds
inhibited HDAC activity in vitro and stimulated cell
differentiation at growth inhibitory concentrations in
MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells in vitro [29]. Munster
and colleagues showed that treatment with SAHA
(suberoylanilide  hydroxamic acid or vorinostat),
resulted in significant changes in the morphology of
MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells suggestive of epithelial
mammary differentiation [30]. Sakimura and colleagues
[31] observed that intraperitoneal administration
of depsipeptide to chondrosarcomas xenografted in
nude mice resulted in down-regulated the synthesis
of glycosaminoglycans and an elevation of alkaline
phosphatase activity; both consistent with chondrosarcoma
differentiation.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors
Epigenetic modifications which affect the chromatin
architecture have been implicated in malignant progression
and transformation [19]. Histone deacetylation, mediated
by histone deacetylases (HDACs), leading to chromatin
compaction is associated with transcriptional repression of
tumor suppressors involved in regulating cell growth and
differentiation in different cancers including sarcomas [20,
21]. Hence, there has been considerable interest in HDAC
inhibitors (HDACIs) and preclinical data to suggest a
differentiation indcuing effect of HDACIs in a variety of
solid tumor and sarcoma models [22-26].
Platta and colleagues showed that a small
cell lung carcinoma cell line, DMS53, underwent
dramatic morphological changes suggestive of cellular

Retinoids
Retinoids are a class of compounds derived from
vitamin A that have demonstrated the ability to regulate
cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in normal
and cancer cells [32]. Retinoids are believed to exert their
effects by binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) that

exist as 3 isoforms (RAR-α/- ß /-γ).
Treatment of osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma
cell lines with ATRA have resulted in reversible growth
inhibition and a decrease in colony formation [33, 34].
Further in vitro studies have showed that retinoic acid
treatment results in hypophosphorylation of RARα
inhibiting cellular proliferation and inducing osteoblastic
differentiation which may provide a potential mechanism
to explain the clinical effects observed [35]. A similar antiproliferation and pro-differentiation effect has also been
described for rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) treated with
retinoids. Use of retinoids in a variety of RMS cell lines
derived from either alveolar or embryonal RMS displayed
a reduction of cell proliferation along with a concomitant
induction of myogenic differentiation [36-39]. Knockdown
of XAB2, believed to be a component of the RAR
corepressor complex, is able to increase ATRA-induced
differentiation in RMS, APML and an ATRA-resistant
neuroblastoma cell lines. Xenografted cells did exhibit
a reduction of proliferation and morphologic evidence
of muscle differentiation following ATRA treatment in
vitro. Levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors
(CDKIs) p18, p21 and p27 were shown to be increased
in all treated RMS cell lines but no CDK4 inhibition or
hypophosphorylation of the Rb protein suggesting that
ATRA-induced differentiation was not sufficient to induce
cell cycle arrest in RMS cells. However, it is important to
note that although ATRA did not reduce the time to relapse,
the tumors obtained from ATRA-treated mice showed
evidence of enhanced muscle differentiation (increased
expression of the terminal muscle differentiation marker
myosin heavy chain). Despite the variable outcomes
following retinoid treatment of sarcoma cells, there
continues to be a significant body of research to support
further investigations into the anti-tumorigenic effects of
retinoid-based differentiation of sarcomas, particularly for
osteosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.

the PPARγ agonist troglitazone resulted in the induction of
the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p18 and
p21 allowing for withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle
and initiation of terminal adipogenic differentiation [42].
Development of knockout mouse models of PPARγ have
revealed its importance in the development of adipose,
placental and cardiac tissue as the null-PPARγ phenotype
is embryonic lethal [43]. Activation of PPARγ with either
endogenous PPARγ agonists (e.g. 15d-PGJ2) or synthetic
agonists (e.g. RSG) have been effective in inducing
cell cycle exit followed by terminal differentiation of
preadipocytes and fibroblast cells implicating PPARγ
activation in the regulation of lipid homeostasis [42, 44,
45].
Cellular differentiation has also been observed
in cancer cell lines. Elstner and colleagues treated
the breast cancer cell line MCF7 with the PPARγ
agonist troglitazone (TGZ) and observed the inhibition
of proliferation along with lipid accumulation. The
combination of TGZ with the RXR agonist, ATRA, had a
synergistic effect in irreversibly inhibiting MCF7 growth,
reduction of BCL2 expression, and apoptosis of cells [46].
Relatedly, Sarraf and colleagues treated colon carcinoma
cells with TGZ and demonstrated an increase in the
levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a marker of
differentiation in colon carcinoma cell lines [47]. Perhaps
one of the more pronounced effects of PPARγ activation
is seen with PPARγ agonist treatment of liposarcoma.
Tontonoz and colleagues were able to show that primary
human liposarcoma (LPS) cells were effectively induced
to undergo terminal adipocytic differentiation following
treatment with the PPARγ agonist, pioglitazone [48].
Furthermore, they demonstrated additive effects in
inducing adipocytic differentiation when LPS cells were
treated with a combination of pioglitazone and an RXRαspecific ligand, LG268. These promising preclinical
results regarding the differentiative effects of PPARγ
agonist treatment in liposarcoma have been subsequently
pursued in a clinical phase II trial utilizing the PPARγ
agonist rosiglitazone [49].

PPARγ Agonists
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor - γ
(PPARγ) has been shown to be an important regulator of
cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in a variety
of cell types including hepatocytes, fibroblasts, myoblasts
and adipocytes [40, 41]. The biological effects of PPARγ
have been found to be related to cell type and the specific
ligand binding to PPARγ. Endogenous ligands of PPARγ
include several unsaturated fatty acids and metabolites of
arachidonic acid such as 15-deoxy-Δ 12,14-prostagladin
J2 (15d-PGJ2). Synthetic ligands of PPARγ have been
developed and include the thiazolidinediones (e.g.
troglitazone, rosiglitazone), oral agents used in the
management of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g. indomethacin).

Trabectedin
Trabectedin (ecteinascidin-743 or ET-743; Yondelis)
is a compound derived from the Caribbean tunicate
Ecteinascidia turbinata and was discovered to have
anti-tumor activity in the early 1970s through a survey
of pharmacologic activity in plant- and marine-derived
materials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute [50].
Binding of trabectedin to the DNA minor groove at the N2
position of guanine is believed to result in conformational
changes of the DNA double helix disrupting the binding
of transcription factors and potentially underlying its
anti-tumor effects in select cancers [51-54]. Forni and
colleagues evaluated the effects of trabectedin treatment
in myxoid liposarcoma cell lines and found that
562

trabectedin induces the dissociation of TLS-CHOP from
target promoter sequences based on a series of chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiments [55]. RT-PCR and
Western immunoblot analyses of TLS-CHOP revealed
stable expression levels suggesting that trabectedin
does not result in the downregulation of TLS-CHOP
expression. The dissociation of TLS-CHOP from target
promoters results in the downregulation of TLS-CHOP
target genes (e.g. CHOP, PTX3, FN1), but consequently
induces an adipogenic differentiation program involving
re-expression of the CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/
EBP) transcription factor family of genes which play key
roles in regulating adipogenic differentiation. In MLS,
TLS-CHOP is believed to sequester C/EBPß preventing
binding to its promoter and blocking progression of the
adipogenic differentiation program. Trabectedin disrupts
the association of TLS-CHOP and C/EBPß allowing C/
EBPß activation of C/EBPα resulting in the initiation
of terminal adipogenic differentiation. The novel
mechanism of action of trabectedin coupled with its
demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models either singly
or in combination with converntional chemotherapy drugs
makes it a promising candidate for continued investigation
in formal clinical trials of patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

LPS was observed. However, such responses could not be
validated in a subsequent trial [49].
In our own clinical experience we have observed
the potent and rapid adipogenic differentiation effects
of trabectedin on one patient with a myxoid round cell
liposarcoma (MRCLS) [54] confirming previous reports
of such rare differentiation-based responses in this
sarcoma sub-type to trabectedin treatment [58]. As we
have recently reported, a heavily pre-treated and locally
recurrent large MRCLS (i.e., tumor displacement of the
diaphragm and liver with complete extention into the
pelvis) underwent a significant change in density from
soft-tissue to fat corresponding to a 10 kg weight loss
following several cycles of single-agent trabectedin. The
patient also exhibited significant clinical improvement,
but without radiological evidence of changes in tumor size
measurements (i.e., stable disease as defined by RECIST
criteria) [54]. The patient, whose disease was rapidly
progressing at the time of trabectedin treatment, lived
another two years without the need for surgical resection.
At the time of our publication [54], he had begun to
progress with areas of high grade sarcoma reasserting
itself in the areas of well-differentiated fat. However, we
are happy to report that he recently underwent aggressive
surgical resection which removed a 55 pound mostly
well-differentiated tumor/fat mass. Thus, review of the
available literature on the potential of trabectedin and
PPARγ agonists coupled with case reports on the efficacy
of these agents in solid tumors highlights the relevancy
and future promise of differentiation-based therapy as a
novel treatment strategy for sarcoma patients warranting
further investigation.

Differentiation-based therapy in patients.
To this point it could be argued that the differentiation
effects described have been limited to cell lines and/or
observed primarily under in vitro conditions. However, we
would contend that differentiation as an in vivo or even a
clinical end point has never been primarily sought out and
thus rarely examined. We now provide clinical examples
to support the preclinical data cited above.
NCI6338 evaluated the HDACI depsipeptide in
patients with progressive recurrent and/or metastatic nonmedullary radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory thyroid
cancer. This trial also evaluated the ability of depsipeptide
to promote differentiation via assessment of increased RAI
avidity in these tumors. Importantly, in a proof of principle
event, clinically observed differentiation of thyroid tumor
cells was observed with significant restoration of RAI
avidity in two patients [56].
Demetri and colleagues conducted a small clinical
trial of the PPARγ agonist troglitazone (TGZ) in patients
with liposarcoma [57]. Serial biopsy results on 3 patients
treated with TGZ revealed histologic changes consistent
with increased lipid accumulation in tumor biopsy samples
as well as marked increases in tumor triglycerides and
phosphatidylcholine levels, and decreases in Ki-67 cell
proliferation marker expression. Interestingly, the degree
of adipocytic differentiation based on tumor triglyceride
levels induced by TGZ treatment was most pronounced
in a patient with the myxoid/round cell LPS variant.
Furthermore, increases in fat density signal based on
serial MRI examination of one patient with pleomorphic

Elucidating the mechanisms behind rare clinical
observations
It is easy to relegate the above examples of clinical
solid tumor differentiation therapy as anectodes and/or
“fascinomas” of clinical medicine. In our own experience
only one of 7 patients with MRCLS responded in such
a manner to trabectedin. One could then ask, “Why?”
If trabectedin works (as described above) via the
reversal of TLS-CHOP-mediated sequestration of proadipogenic transcription factors resulting in re-initiation
of the adipogenic program, why did only one of 7 patients
experience the differentiation effect? Our recent work
identified that this patient had one specific sub-type of
TLS-CHOP (type II) and that this was also the only patient
who possessed a mutated form of p53 [54]. Knowing
this, we were able to generate an MRCLS mouse model
that not only recapitulated MRCLS histopathology, but
also its differentiation-based response to trabectedin.
Perhaps more importantly we were able to use this
model to demonstrate two important points: (a) ET-743
(trabectedin) downregulates TLS-CHOP expression post563

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 559-567

transcriptionally; and (b) once adipocytic differentiation
has been re-initiated via the actions of trabectedin, PPARγ
agonists can then accelerate the differentiation process.
We propose that once the biology of a cancer is better
understood, differentiation therapy loses its mysticism. In
short, as we, as a scientific-medical community, uncover
both the developmental origins of cancer as well as
the differentiation pathways that promote the normal
maturation of cells, the re-institution of the latter (i.e.,
normal differentiation) into the former (i.e., cancer cells)
will become more and more routine. As a result, we will
undoubtedly look back at these days of one-fit-for-all
cytotoxic chemotherapies as not only overly simplistic but
literally, not just figuratively, off-target.

fatal cancer into one more amenable to management or to
treatment using conventional therapeutic approaches. For
differentiation therapy to be successful, it does not need
to eliminate all the cancer cells or even differentiate them
all to “normal” mature cells. If successful, the change in
pathological status alone (e.g., from high grade to low
grade or poorly to well differentiated), accomplished using
differentiation therapy, will change the prognosis of most
patients with cancer by decades.

Going forward with differentiation therapy
In this review, we have provided pre-clinical, clinical
and mechanistic evidence for solid tumor differentiation
therapy. But to imply that all differentiation therapy is
going to be the same would be to simplify what is likely
an extremely complicated phenomenon. We now present
three ways in which cancer differentiation therapy
can theoretically occur (Figure 1): 1) cancer directed
differentiation; 2) cancer reverted differentiation; and
3) cancer diverted differentiation. In cancer directed
differentiation, differentiation pathways are activated
without correcting the underlying oncogenic mechanisms
that have resulted in the initial differentiation block.
In cancer reverted differentiation, correction of the
underlying oncogenic mechanism results in natural
restoration of endogenous differentiation pathways.
Lastly, in cancer diverted differentiation, the cancer cell
is redirected to an earlier stage of differentiation where
access to alternative differentiation routes may be feasible.
Thus, the cancer cell may then differentiate along an
alternative lineage towards one in which its differentiation
was not blocked.
Although it is tempting to ascribe the previously
presented examples of differentiation therapy to the
various mechanistic models of differentiation therapy just
described, we will not do so here as such an assignment
would imply that we completely understand the means
in which differentiation is achieved in these cancer cells.
Finally, we believe that there is great plasticity to these
processes and differentiation therapy is likely to follow a
spectrum of possibilities that may ultimately, at best, be
only approximated by the models described above.
The general end point for cancer therapeutics has
revolved around the idea of a complete eradication of
cancer cells. Although adoption of a differentiation-based
approach to this tenet of medical therapy may seem like
a consolation, the potential for reversion of the malignant
cancer phenotype to a more benign, or at the very least
a lower grade of biologic aggressiveness, may serve as
a critical clinical and biologic transition of a uniformly
