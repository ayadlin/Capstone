Abstract
Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a hypoxia and HIF-1–inducible protein that regulates intra- and extracellular
pH under hypoxic conditions and promotes tumor cell survival and invasion in hypoxic microenvironments.
Interrogation of 3,630 human breast cancers provided definitive evidence of CAIX as an independent poor
prognostic biomarker for distant metastases and survival. shRNA-mediated depletion of CAIX expression in 4T1
mouse metastatic breast cancer cells capable of inducing CAIX in hypoxia resulted in regression of orthotopic
mammary tumors and inhibition of spontaneous lung metastasis formation. Stable depletion of CAIX in MDAMB-231 human breast cancer xenografts also resulted in attenuation of primary tumor growth. CAIX depletion
in the 4T1 cells led to caspase-independent cell death and reversal of extracellular acidosis under hypoxic
conditions in vitro. Treatment of mice harboring CAIX-positive 4T1 mammary tumors with novel CAIX-specific
small molecule inhibitors that mimicked the effects of CAIX depletion in vitro resulted in significant inhibition of
tumor growth and metastasis formation in both spontaneous and experimental models of metastasis, without
inhibitory effects on CAIX-negative tumors. Similar inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth were observed in
mice harboring orthotopic tumors comprised of lung metatstatic MDA-MB-231 LM2-4Lucþ cells. Our findings
show that CAIX is vital for growth and metastasis of hypoxic breast tumors and is a specific, targetable
biomarker for breast cancer metastasis. Cancer Res; 71(9); 3364–76. 2011 AACR.

breast cancer metastasis (4, 5). Furthermore, there is now
growing evidence that altered tumor metabolism and hypoxiainducible factor 1a (HIF-1a)-regulated enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and CAXII may be vital to the
process of tumor progression to metastasis (2, 6).
CAIX is a dimeric membrane-bound enzyme that efficiently
catalyzes the reversible hydration of CO2 (7, 8). CAIX is
selectively expressed in hypoxic tumors, including breast
malignancies (9, 10), and its presence is a poor prognostic
marker for patients with breast cancer (11, 12). The tumorspecific expression of CAIX and its association with cancer
progression and poor treatment outcome has led to interest in
targeting this enzyme for cancer therapy (8). Studies have
focused on the utilization of CAIX as a biomarker of hypoxic
tumors, spurring the development of specific antibodies and
sulfonamide-based small molecules for imaging CAIX in vivo
(13–17). However, the relevance of CAIX function to the
biology of tumors has only recently come into focus. Evidence
suggests that together with the activity of proteins, such as the
Naþ/Hþ exchanger NHE1, Naþ-HCO3 cotransporters, and
monocarboxylate transporters MCT-1 and MCT-4 (18, 19), the
activity of CAIX plays an important role in the survival of
tumor cells in hypoxic regions of tumors (18, 20) through the
regulation of tumor pH (18, 20). The HCO3 produced at the

Black plate (3365,1)

extracellular surface by CAIX is transported into the cytosol to
control an intracellular pH (pHi) that is challenged by the
abnormally acidic extracellular pH (pHe) produced in hypoxia
(18, 20–22). The protons derived from CAIX activity further
contribute to the decrease in pHe, thereby potentiating extracellular matrix breakdown and cell invasion (6, 19). Therefore,
CAIX may increase metastatic potential by allowing aggressive
tumor cells to survive the hostile environment imposed by
hypoxia, and may further function to potentiate extracellular
acidosis, facilitating growth and invasion of surviving cells (18,
20–22).
Although targeting CAIX for the treatment of cancer has
garnered much scientific and clinical interest, appropriate
carbonic anhydrase-relevant cell and animal models of tumor
hypoxia for testing novel, CAIX-active compounds have only
recently become available (23). To date, studies have focused
on the role of CAIX in the regulation of primary tumor growth
(22, 24). Importantly, neither the functional requirement of
CAIX in breast tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, nor the
benefit of therapeutic targeting this enzyme in aggressive
breast cancer has been addressed.
In this study, we provide definitive evidence, using a large
(>3,600) cohort of human breast cancer samples, that CAIX is
a poor prognostic marker for distant metastasis and survival.
Furthermore, using a combination of gene depletion strategies
and pharmacologic inhibition with novel small molecule
inhibitors, we show a functional requirement of CAIX in
the growth and metastasis of mouse and human breast
tumors in several preclinical models. Our findings establish
CAIX as a therapeutic target for the treatment of CAIXpositive breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and hypoxic exposure
The acquisition, generation, and culture of the luciferase
expressing mouse breast cancer cell lines 4T1, 66cl4, and 67NR
have been described previously (25). The MDA-MB-231 human
breast cancer cell line was obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and was maintained as described previously (26). The MDA-MB-231 LM2-4Lucþ cell line was provided by Dr. Robert Kerbel (University of Toronto, Canada) in
July, 2010 and cells were cultured as described previously (27).
For in vitro studies, cell lines were passaged for a maximum of
3 months, after which fresh seed stocks were thawed for
experimental use. All cells were incubated at 37 C with 5%
CO2 in a humidified incubator (normoxia). For culture in
hypoxia, cells were maintained in 1% O2 and 5% CO2 balanced
with N2 at 37 C in a humidified incubator in a sealed anaerobic workstation. Cell lines were evaluated routinely for
morphology, hypoxia-induced CAIX expression, and in vivo
tumor growth.
Generation of transfected and transduced cells
shRNAmir vectors targeting mouse CAIX and a nonsilencing
sequence (Open Biosystems) were transfected into 4T1 cells by
LipofectAMINE-PLUS (Invitrogen Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were

www.aacrjournals.org

selected by using hygromycin. Stable shCAIX clones were
derived by limited dilution cloning. For (re)introduction of
CAIX, human CAIX (gift from Dr. Jacques Pouyssegur,
University of Nice, Nice, France) was transfected into 4T1 cells
stably expressing mouse shCAIX, and Zeocin was used for
selection.
For stable depletion of human CAIX in the MDA-MB-231
cells, 2 different shRNAmir constructs (Open Biosystems)
were transduced into cells by using lentivirus as per the
manufacturer's instructions. Transduced cells were selected
by using puromycin.
All transfected and transduced cell lines were selected,
propagated, and frozen as seed stocks at early passage. For
in vivo studies, cells were thawed from frozen stocks, passaged
1–2 times to expand the culture, and implanted in mice. Cell
lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination by a commercial testing facility prior to implantation in mice.
Measurement of extracellular pH
Changes in pHe were assessed by using procedures published previously (28–30). In brief, cells were plated and
allowed to recover overnight. A standard volume of 3 mL
of fresh media/dish was then added and cells were incubated
in normoxia or hypoxia for 72 hours. Care was taken to ensure
that cultures grown in normoxia and hypoxia were subconfluent and contained similar cell numbers. Media was collected and pH was measured immediately by a digital pH
meter.
Pharmacological inhibitors
The chemical properties of the sulfonamide, CAI17, have
been described previously (8, 30). For in vitro studies, CAI17
was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, stored at 80 C and
diluted into culture medium prior to application. Subconfluent cells were incubated with CAI17 for 72 hours, washed 3
times in PBS, and imaged by a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence
microscope. For in vivo studies, CAI17, ureido-sulfonamide U104, and glycosyl coumarins GC-204 and GC-205 were solubilized in 37.5% PEG400/12.5% ethanol/50% saline prior to
injection. Drug aliquots were made fresh daily or were prepared, frozen at 80 C in single-use aliquots, and thawed
prior to administration. Drugs were administered by i.p.
injection, except for CAI17, in which the first 2 doses were
administered by i.v. injection, followed by i.p. injection of the
remaining doses. Specific dosing schedules are described in
the appropriate figures.
Analysis of protein expression
Cells or flash-frozen tumor tissues were lysed as described
previously (26). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on SDSPAGE gels. Western blots were carried out as described previously (26) by using mouse CAIX (1:500), human CAIX (1:1,000;
R&D Systems), caspase 3 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), PARP-1
(1:1,000; Cell Signaling), and b-actin (1:10,000, Sigma) antibodies.
Mouse tumor models
All animal studies and procedures were done in accordance
with protocols approved by the Institution Animal Care

Syngeneic orthotopic tumors and spontaneous
metastasis
4T1 cells (1  106) or 67NR cells (2  106) were orthotopically implanted into the fourth mammary fat pad of 7- to 9week-old female BALB/c mice as described previously (25).
Primary tumor growth rates were calculated from caliper
measurements by using the modified ellipsoid formula,
(L  W2)/2 (L, length; W, width). Tumor formation and
metastasis progression was monitored and quantified by
bioluminescent imaging as previously described (25, 27).
Experimental metastasis assays
For studies involving genetic depletion of CAIX, 4T1 or
67NR cells (5  105) were injected directly into the tail vein of
7- to 9-week-old female BALB/c mice. Mice were imaged once
per week to follow the growth of metastases. Mice were
euthanized 20 days postinjection and lungs were resected
for further analysis. Tumor burden in the lung was quantified
by manually counting nodules visible on the lung surface. For
studies by U-104, 4T1 cells (1  105) were injected as described
earlier in the text, whereas 2  105 cells were used for studies
with GC-204 and GC-205.
Human xenograft tumors
For studies involving CAIX depletion, 1  107 MDA-MB-231
cells suspended in a 50% Matrigel/PBS solution were
implanted subcutaneously in 6- to 8-week-old female NOD.
CB17-prkdcscid/J mice. For primary breast tumor xenografts
by the MDA-MB-231 LM2-4Lucþ variant, cells were implanted
orthotopically in mice as described earlier in the text. Therapy
was initiated when the tumor volumes reached 200 mm3.
For both models, tumor growth was monitored by caliper
measurement.
Immunohistochemistry
Two hours before tumor excision, mice were injected i.p.
with a saline solution containing 1,500 mg/kg bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma) and 60 mg/kg Pimonidazole (Chemicon), and i.v.
5 minutes before with DiOC7(3) (70 mL, 0.6 mg/mL; Molecular
Probes). Tumors were then harvested and analyzed for vasculature, perfusion, hypoxia, apoptosis, proliferation, and
necrosis as described previously (31, 32). Paraffin-embedded
tumor sections were also stained for CAIX (1:50 for lung
metastases; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as previously
described (25).
Apoptosis assay
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL; Roche Applied Science) was
employed for analysis of apoptosis according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, subconfluent cells grown on
coverslips were incubated for 48 hours in normoxia or hypoxia
in 1% serum, fixed, and analyzed for TUNEL-positive cells.
Quantification was achieved by counting the number of

magnification.
Clinical analysis
The methods used to create the tumor tissue microarrays
(TMA) have been described (33). A total of 3,630 cases had
adequate tumor and staining results for assessment of all
biomarkers. Immunohistochemistry for ER, PR, HER2, CK 5/6,
EGFR, and Ki67 was carried out concurrently on serial sections and scored as described previously (33). CAIX expression
was assessed by using a murine monoclonal antibody (M75;
1:50; ref. 34). Scoring of CAIX expression was either 0 (no
staining) or 1 (any staining) and done independently and
blindly by 2 pathologists. This scoring system has been
developed and validated for this very large TMA, and has
been used previously to show prognostic significance for
breast cancer biomarkers such as HER-2 and Ki67 (33, 35).
The stained images of the complete tissue core set are available at the publicly accessible website http://bliss.gpec.ubc.ca.
Prior approval of the study was obtained from the Ethics
Committee of the University of British Columbia.
Statistical analysis
Results were subjected to statistical analysis by the Data
Analysis ToolPack in Excel software. Two-tailed P values were
calculated by Student's t-test. Data were considered significant for P < 0.05. Statistical analysis for the clinical outcomes
was carried out by SPSS 13.0, S-Plus 6.2, and R 2.1.1 (http://
www.r-project.org). In univariate analysis, BCSS (date of diagnosis of primary breast cancer to date of death with breast
cancer as the primary or underlying cause), RFS (date of
diagnosis of primary breast cancer to the date of a local,
regional, or distant recurrence), and distant RFS (date of
diagnosis of primary breast cancer to the date of a distant
recurrence) were estimated by Kaplan–Meier curves. Log-rank
test was used to estimate the survival differences. For multivariate analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used
to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios and significance. To
assess the violations of proportional hazard models, smoothed
plots of weighted Schoenfeld residuals were used.

Results and Discussion
CAIX is a poor prognostic marker in a large cohort of
breast cancer patients
Although previous studies have reported that CAIX expression in several types of cancer, including breast cancer,
correlates with poor patient prognosis (11, 34, 36, 37), the
sample sizes have been relatively small and adjuvant treatments not uniform. To provide definitive evidence for CAIX as
an important breast cancer prognostic marker, we analyzed
the expression of CAIX in a primary breast TMA containing
more than 3,600 patient samples subjected to standardized
treatment with a median follow-up of 10.5 years (Supplementary Table S1). Previously, we showed prognostic significance
of CAIX in a cohort of 103 breast cancers in which CAIX
expression was examined both as a continuous and a categorical variable (11). We found that even 1% staining was

significantly prognostic. For the large cohort of patients
examined here, a simplified scoring system (present vs.
absent) allows for less analytical variability, an issue which
plagues immunohistochemical testing for hormone receptors
and the HER-2 receptor in breast cancer. CAIX expression was
seen in 15.6% of assessable tumors and CAIX was differentially
expressed among the biological subtypes, with the highest
correlation in the basal breast cancers (51%) and the lowest
proportion in the luminal A subtype (8%; Supplementary
Table S2).
In Kaplan–Meier analyses, CAIX expression was significantly associated with worse relapse-free survival (Fig. 1A),
distant relapse-free survival (Fig. 1B), and breast cancer–
specific survival (Fig. 1C), achieving very high levels of

statistical significance. The 10-year distant relapse-free survival and breast cancer specific survival rates in the CAIXpositive versus CAIX-negative groups were 57% compared
with 73%, and 62% compared with 78%, respectively. In
multivariate analyses, including all standard prognostic
variables and biological subtypes, CAIX expression remained
a strong independent poor prognostic factor with a hazard
ratio of 1.4 (Supplementary Table S3). These data confirm
and extend the results of previous studies, and show a clear
link between CAIX expression and a higher rate of distant
metastasis for breast cancer. Our data substantiate previous
studies that have also shown CAIX as a poor prognostic
marker of breast cancer (11, 12). In addition, other studies
have shown a clear correlation between the expression of
CAIX, hypoxia-induced HIF-1a, and altered metabolic proteins such as GLUT-1 (4, 9, 38), although HIF-1a is a more
labile protein, and thus more susceptible to preanalytical
variables.
Preclinical models for interrogating the requirement of
hypoxia-induced CAIX expression in breast cancer
Tumor hypoxia is linked both to the expression of CAIX and
to the selection of tumor cells that are better able to metastasize. However, although a few studies have investigated the
role of CAIX in the regulation of primary tumor growth (22,
24), the relationship between CAIX expression and metastatic
potential has not been investigated. Therefore, to interrogate
the functional role of CAIX in metastatic breast cancer, we
were interested in selecting tumor models that exhibit both
hypoxic microenvironments and the ability to metastasize. We
have shown previously that the highly metastatic 4T1 mouse
mammary tumor (39) overexpresses CAIX (25). Further characterization of this model revealed that it is poorly vascularized and contains large regions of hypoxia and necrosis
(Fig. 2A). Indeed, tumors formed by 4T1 cells have significantly
less blood vessels, and significantly higher amounts of
hypoxia, necrosis, and apoptosis compared with tumors
formed by isogenic, nonmetastatic (25) 67NR cells (Fig. 2A
and B). Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis of differential
gene expression data (25) identified several hypoxia-regulated
genes, including CAIX, that are expressed at higher levels in
the 4T1 tumors relative to the 67NR tumors (Fig. 2C). These
attributes make the 4T1 mouse mammary tumor a robust
model for examining the effects of manipulating CAIX expression and activity on the progression of breast cancer.
In addition to this syngeneic mouse model, we selected the
MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cell line, as previous
studies have shown this model to be hypoxic and to have
hypoxia-inducible levels of CAIX (40, 41). We confirmed the
effect of hypoxia on CAIX expression in these cell lines to
validate them as appropriate models for subsequent in vivo
studies. In keeping with previously published findings (25, 41),
we found that both cell lines induced CAIX expression in
hypoxia (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S1A), in contrast to the
absence of hypoxia-induced CAIX in the 67NR cells (Fig. 2D;
Supplementary Fig. S1A). These models reflect the clinical
findings shown in Figure 1 and in other studies (11, 12) of
hypoxia-induced upregulation of CAIX expression.

Depletion of CAIX in 4T1 cells inhibits cell survival and
alters pHe
Next, we silenced CAIX gene expression in the 4T1 cells
(Fig. 3A) and the MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3B) by stably
expressing CAIX short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs.
4T1 cells expressing a nonsilencing control shRNA (shNS)
upregulated expression of CAIX in hypoxia as expected,
whereas hypoxia-induced CAIX expression was markedly
attenuated in 2 independent clones expressing a single, identical shRNA targeting mouse CAIX (shCAIX; Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Similarly, for the MDA-MB-231 cell line, 2
distinct shRNA sequences targeting human CAIX were trans-

duced and hypoxia-induced CAIX expression was analyzed.
Only one of the transduced shRNA constructs was found to
effectively deplete CAIX expression (Fig. 3B; Supplementary
Fig. S1C). The cell line expressing the "nonsilencing" CAIX
shRNA sequence was used as a control in subsequent in vivo
experiments.
Recent data suggest that the regulation of pH by CAIX may
be important for cell survival in conditions of hypoxic stress
(22, 42) and previous studies have shown a reduction in
clonogenic survival in hypoxia of MDA-MB-231 cells treated
with siRNA to CAIX (41). To examine whether depletion of
CAIX may be influencing cell survival in the 4T1 system, we

cultured control and CAIX-depleted 4T1 cells in hypoxia and
assessed the amount of cell death by using a TUNEL assay. 4T1
shCAIX cells showed a significant increase in cell death
compared shNS cells (Fig. 3C). To determine whether the
increase in TUNEL-positive cells was because of an increase in
apoptosis, we analyzed the levels of active caspase-3 and
PARP. No clear evidence of increased caspase-3 cleavage
(Supplementary Fig. S2A) or PARP cleavage (Supplementary
Fig. S2B) was observed, suggesting that cell death in the CAIXdepleted cells may be occurring by a caspase-independent
mechanism, possibly related to depletion of the intracellular
ATP concentration (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Although
the decrease in ATP concentration was modest, it was sta-

tistically significant and similar in magnitude to data reported
previously (43).
CAIX is functionally linked to the control of tumor pH (18,
22, 42), and hypoxia-induced, extracellular acidosis is a measure of the biological activity of CAIX in cultured cells (30).
Therefore, we examined the effect of CAIX depletion on pHe in
hypoxia. Acidification of the extracellular medium in hypoxia
was inhibited in the shCAIX-expressing 4T1 clones relative to
the parental and shNS-expressing 4T1 cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting that silencing CAIX gene expression induces functional
inhibition of pHe regulation in this cell line.
Depletion of CAIX expression results in regression or
growth inhibition of mouse and human breast tumors
Having evaluated the biological response of 4T1 cells to
CAIX depletion in vitro, we next tested the impact of silencing
CAIX expression on the growth of these tumors in vivo. We
observed that whereas control 4T1 cells formed tumors that
grew steadily over 30 days, tumors established from CAIXdepleted cells regressed significantly after initial tumor
growth (Fig. 4A). The regression of the tumors seemed to
be stable, as there were only 2 mice with primary tumor
recurrence appearing toward the end of the study (Supplementary Table S4). Examination of the primary tumors confirmed downregulation of CAIX expression in the tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The reduction of CAIX expression
had a dramatic effect on the overall survival of the mice
(Fig. 4B). Although the animals bearing tumors that express
CAIX did not survive, the survival rate of animals inoculated
with CAIX-depleted 4T1 cells remained at 100% over the
course of the study.
To validate the observed in vivo effects of CAIX depletion on
primary human breast tumor growth, we conducted similar
experiments by using the MDA-MB-231 cells expressing
human shCAIX (Fig. 3B). Depletion of CAIX significantly
attenuated tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts
(Fig. 4C). Importantly, both the parental cells and the cells
expressing the nonsilencing construct (shCAIX 1 NS) formed
tumors at a similar rate (Fig. 4C), showing the specificity of the
effect of CAIX depletion on tumor growth. These data provide
strong evidence for an important functional role of CAIX in
the growth of hypoxic primary breast tumors.
To show that the tumor regression seen with the 4T1
shCAIX cells was dependent specifically on CAIX, we
attempted to rescue the tumor growth by introducing human
CAIX (resistant to mouse CAIX shRNA) into 4T1 cells expressing mouse-specific shCAIX. Human CAIX expression was
readily detectable on the cell surface, together with stable
expression of mouse shCAIX (Fig. 4D). Cell cultures expressing
human CAIX in tandem with shRNA to mouse CAIX showed
low numbers of TUNEL-positive cells (Supplementary Fig. S4),
similar to control 4T1 cells (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the mammary tumors established from these cells grew at rates similar
to those of the parental 4T1 tumors (Fig. 4D), confirming the
specificity of CAIX-targeting in the regression of the 4T1
tumors.

in the regulation of tumor growth (22). In this model, shRNAmediated depletion of CAIX expression resulted in a partial
reduction in tumor growth and compensatory upregulation of
CAXII, whereas depletion of expression of both proteins
resulted in greater inhibition of tumor growth (22). Our
current findings suggest that, in breast cancer, CAIX alone
is important for the growth of breast tumors. Our data
showing that overriding CAIX depletion by constitutive
expression of human CAIX can rescue tumor growth strongly
implicates the dependency of these metastatic tumors on
CAIX function. In addition, CAIX depletion in MDA-MB-231
human breast cancer cells, a cell line which is deficient in

3370

Cancer Res; 71(9) May 1, 2011

CAXII expression (44), also significantly reduced tumor
growth. The reasons for the lack of CAXII dependence in
these models are not known, but it is possible that the relative
expression of CAIX versus CAXII in different cell types may be
an important factor.
Inhibition of CAIX inhibits metastasis of 4T1 breast
tumors
Although a reduction in colon tumor growth in response
to CAIX depletion has been shown previously (22) and
CAIX has been shown to influence cell migration in vitro
(45), CAIX has not been previously linked to metastasis

in vivo. Given the metastatic potential of the 4T1 cells, in
particular, we were interested in determining whether inhibition of CAIX expression or activity also inhibited breast
tumor metastasis. To investigate the effects of CAIX depletion on spontaneous metastasis of primary breast tumors
in vivo, we employed bioluminescent imaging to detect
metastases arising from control (parental and shNS) and
CAIX-depleted 4T1 tumors (Fig. 5A). Whereas the mice
implanted with control cells showed clear evidence of
metastasis to several organs, (In Vivo Imaging System)
IVIS-detectable metastases were not observed in mice that
had been implanted with the CAIX-depleted cells.

To show that the observed effects on the formation of
metastases were not simply because of primary tumor
regression, we injected the various 4T1 tumor cell lines
intravenously and assessed the ability of the cells to form
lung metastases (Fig. 5B). We found that, whereas the shNS
cells formed robust lung metastases, cells depleted of CAIX
showed almost no visible metastasis to the lungs. 67NR cells
also showed little evidence of experimental metastasis
(Fig. 5B). Quantification of bioluminescent signal at 2 and
3 weeks postinjection showed a significant increase in signal
in the shNS group, but not in the shCAIX and 67NR groups
(Fig. 5B). Examination of the gross lungs revealed that

animals injected with shNS cells exhibited large number of
lung surface nodules, whereas nodules were largely absent in
mice injected with shCAIX cells or 67NR cells (Fig. 5C).
Quantification of surface nodules showed that mice harboring shNS cells had significantly higher counts than mice
harboring shCAIX or 67NR cells (Fig. 5C). Membrane-localized CAIX expression was also evident in some of the
metatstatic foci in histologic sections taken from control
animals, but not from mice inoculated with CAIX-depleted
cells (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data suggest that CAIX

may be required for colonization and growth of metastatic
cells at secondary sites.
Pharmacologic inhibition of CAIX reduces the growth
and metastasis of mouse and human tumors
Our data showing the requirement of CAIX expression for
survival and eventual metastasis of primary breast tumor
cells suggested that targeting the activity of CAIX with
specific pharmacologic inhibitors may be useful for inhibiting disease progression. In previous studies, treatment of

renal clear cell carcinoma xenografts with fluorescein- and
albumin-based membrane-impermeant derivatives of acetazolamide, a general carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, resulted
in inhibition of tumor growth compared with vehicle-treated
controls (24). These data have provided initial proof of
principle for sulfonamide-based antitumor effects, but acetazolamide lacks specificity for CAIX. First, we investigated
the ability of the metastatic and nonmetastatic cells to bind
to a previously described, highly selective sulfonamide-based
inhibitor of CAIX (CAI17) with a Kiin vitro of 24 nmol/L (8).
This fluorescent inhibitor (Fig. 6A) interacts only with active
CAIX in hypoxic conditions (8) and has been used successfully to image hypoxic xenografts (15). Similar to findings in
MDCK cells expressing CAIX (30), we observed that the
inhibitor was not able to bind appreciably 4T1 or 67NR
cells in normoxia (Fig. 6A). In contrast, CAI17 bound to the
cell surfaces of metastatic, CAIX-expressing 4T1 cells cultured in hypoxia, but not the nonmetastatic, CAIX-negative
67NR cells cultured in similar conditions (Fig. 6A). We next
tested the effect of CAI17 on hypoxia-induced changes in
pHe in these 2 cell types. In the absence of the inhibitor, the
pHe of cultured 4T1 cells decreased significantly in hypoxia,
but remained unchanged in the 67NR cultures (Fig. 6A).
Treatment of the 4T1 cells with CAI17 reversed the hypoxiainduced decline of pHe, indicating functional inhibition of
CAIX activity (Fig. 6A).
To evaluate the effect of pharmacologic inhibition of CAIX
activity in vivo, we treated mice harboring established 4T1
tumors with CAI17. We observed significant inhibition of
tumor growth in mice treated with the inhibitor, compared
with vehicle controls (Fig. 6B). To test for the possibility of
nonspecific cytotoxic activity of CAI17, we took advantage of
the 67NR tumor model as a negative control. We treated 67NR
cell-derived tumors by using a dosing schedule and concentrations of CAI17 identical to those used for the 4T1 model
(Fig. 6C). There was no effect of the CAI17 compound relative
to the vehicle control, even at the highest concentration of the
inhibitor (Fig. 6C). The inhibitor concentrations and the
dosing schedule were well tolerated, and no significant weight
reduction was noted in any of the treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B). In addition to CAI17, we tested the effect
of a novel ureido-sulfonamide inhibitor of CAIX, U-104
(Fig. 6D; Table 1), on primary breast tumor growth by using

www.aacrjournals.org

a highly metastatic variant of the MDA-MB-231 cell line (27).
These cells were observed to robustly induce CAIX in hypoxia
(Fig. 6D, inset). Tumor volume measurements showed significant inhibition of primary tumor growth in the mice
treated with the U-104 compound compared with vehicle
controls (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these data suggest the
ability of sulfonamide-based CAIX inhibitors to specifically
target CAIX-expressing tumors.
Having shown that selective sulfonamide-based compounds inhibit the growth of primary breast tumors, we next
tested U-104 for its ability to inhibit metastasis formation in
the 4T1 experimental metastasis model. Intravenous injection
of 4T1 cells into mice and subsequent daily treatment of these
animals beginning 24 hours postinjection with U-104 resulted
in inhibition of metastases formation (Fig. 7A). Quantification
of the bioluminescent signal revealed a statistically significant
decrease in the formation of metastases in the treated mice
(Fig. 7A), suggesting that CAIX-specific inhibition may be
useful in treating metastatic disease in breast cancer. Further
structure/function analyses for the ureido-sulfonamide compounds will be described elsewhere (46).
Finally, we also tested the ability of 2 additional selective
inhibitors of CAIX, GC-204, and GC-205 (Fig. 7B; Table 1), to
inhibit metastasis in the same model. These 2 novel compounds are glycosyl coumarins and are representatives of
the coumarin class of CAIX inhibitors. GC-204 and GC-205
were effective in limiting colonization in the lungs (Fig. 7B).
Quantification of the bioluminescent signal revealed a statistically significant decrease in the formation of metastases
in the treated mice (Fig. 7C), with GC-205 being particularly
efficacious at 15 mg/kg (Fig. 7C). Collectively, these pharmacologic studies provide strong "proof of principle" data
for the therapeutic inhibition of CAIX activity for breast
tumor growth and metastasis formation. Moreover, our
results suggest that perturbation of CAIX function reduces
metastasis both by inhibiting cell survival in hypoxia and
perhaps also by preventing migration and invasion, as
inhibition of CAIX reduced the metastatic burden in models
of experimental metastasis.
In conclusion, our results not only solidify CAIX as a poor
prognostic biomarker for human breast cancer, but also show
it to be a promising therapeutic target for breast tumor
growth and metastasis. Our data show that CAIX is an
essential factor in the survival of tumor cells in hypoxic
regions of breast tumors and, in addition, its activity contributes to metastasis in breast cancer. Its use would allow for
the identification and selection of patients whose tumors are
likely to metastasize, and for treatment with CAIX inhibitors
to prevent this deadly process. Although CAIX expression is
elevated in approximately 16% of breast cancer patients, this
percentage falls in with the frequency of upregulation of Her-2
and of basal breast cancers which have the highest expression
of CAIX (Supplementary Table S2). Because these subgroups
of breast cancers are the most difficult to treat and are also the
most aggressive in terms of metastatic potential, we suggest
that CAIX inhibitors, such as those described here, should be
used to treat hypoxic breast tumors with elevated CAIX
expression. The development of small molecule inhibitors
