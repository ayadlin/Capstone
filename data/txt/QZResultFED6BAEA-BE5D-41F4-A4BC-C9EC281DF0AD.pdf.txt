The MAPK Pathway Across Different
Malignancies: A New Perspective

Elise C. Kohn, MD1,2

The mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated (MAPK/ERK) pathway is activated by upstream genomic events
and/or activation of multiple signaling events in which information coalesces at this important nodal pathway point. This pathway is
tightly regulated under normal conditions by phosphatases and bidirectional communication with other pathways, like the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/m-TOR) pathway. Recent evidence indicates that the MAPK/ERK signaling node can
function as a tumor suppressor as well as the more common pro-oncogenic signal. The effect that predominates depends on the intensity of the signal and the context or tissue in which the signal is aberrantly activated. Genomic profiling of tumors has revealed
common mutations in MAPK/ERK pathway components, such as v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF). Currently
approved for the treatment of melanoma, inhibitors of BRAF kinase are being studied alone and in combination with inhibitors of the
MAPK and other pathways to optimize the treatment of many tumor types. Therapies targeted toward MAPK/ERK components have
various response rates when used in different solid tumors, such as colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer. Understanding the differential nature of activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in each tumor type is critical in developing single and combination regimens,
because different tumors have unique mechanisms of primary and secondary signaling and subsequent sensitivity to drugs. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Great advances have been made toward understanding the genomic characterization of solid and hematologic malignancies. Collaborative projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),1 have revealed the molecular complexity of
tumors and also the challenges inherent in data interpretation and clinical application. Differentiation of targetable driver
mutations from genetic and genomic noise and passenger mutations is 1 of the most important goals of genome and epigenome analysis.2,3 Driver mutations lead to dysregulation of signaling pathways, increasing malignant behavior.4 It has
been demonstrated that many of these gain-of-function driver mutations are druggable, leading to the development of
small molecules and antibodies that target specific events, such as the ligand-binding site of the receptor or the adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) binding site in the kinase domain of specific kinase proteins.
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a critical pathway for human cancer cell survival, dissemination, and resistance to drug therapy.5 The MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is a convergent
signaling node that receives input from numerous stimuli, including internal metabolic stress and DNA damage pathways
and altered protein concentrations, as well as through signaling from external growth factors, cell-matrix interactions, and
communication from other cells.6 Mutated genes responsible for the regulation of cell fate, genome integrity, and survival
can lead to increased protein amplification and alter the tumor microenvironment, thus overactivating the pathway.7
These mutations can occur upstream in membrane receptor genes, such as epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR),8 in
signal transducers (RAS),9 regulatory partners (Sprouty),10 and downstream kinases that belong to the MAPK/ERK pathway itself (BRAF) (Fig. 1).11,12 Several mutations involving the MAPK/ERK pathway have been identified in human cancers and are ripe for targeting. Current and future drug-development efforts will need to alter and regulate tumor
signaling in this complex network of codependent pathways.

Tissue-Specific MAPK Signaling/Burotto et al

The MAPK Pathway and its Regulation

There are 4 independent MAPK pathways composed of 4
signaling families: the MAPK/ERK family or classical
pathway and the Big MAP kinase-1 (BMK-1), c-Jun Nterminal kinase (JNK), and p38 signaling families.13
These families share a basic organization composed of 2
serine/threonine kinases and 1 double-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinase.14 Generically, these kinases are designated from upstream to downstream, closer to the
nucleus, as MAPK kinase-kinase (MAPKKK), MAPK kinase (MAPKK) and MAPK (Fig. 1).5 The canonical
MAPK/ERK pathway is composed of 3 types of
MAPKKK: A-RAF, B-RAF, and RAF-1 or C-RAF kinases. BRAF is the gene most commonly mutated at this
level in human cancer. One level below are the MAPKKs,
which are composed of MEK1 and MEK2. Finally, further downstream are ERK1 and ERK2, which are the final
effectors of the MAPK pathway.15
ERK phosphorylation results in the activation of
multiple substrates that are responsible for the stimulation
of cell proliferation. Spatial localization of ERK determines target substrates and later effects within the cell.6
When located in the cytoplasm, ERK phosphorylates
cytoskeletal proteins that affect cell movement and trafficking,16 metabolism, cell adhesion, and nodal regulation
of other pathways.17 Cytoplasmic substrates include ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs), which regulate the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) involved in metabolism, and L1
adhesion molecule, a protein of neural origin that participates in cell adhesion.18,19 Minutes after MAPK/ERK
activation, ERK detaches from cytoplasmic anchoring
proteins and translocates to the nucleus to exert its transcriptional regulation.20 Active ERK in the nucleus causes
phosphorylation and activation of various transcription
factors, such as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II (CPS
II) linking with synthesis of DNA or p90RSK and promoting cell cycle progression. These 2 events are integral
in MEK/ERK stimulation of cell proliferation.21,22 In
immune cells, activated ERK is also a component of the
innate response in different steps of the inflammatory cascade, increasing the expression of tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-a) and inducible nitric oxide synthase
(iNOS).23
In addition to spatial activation, the final effect of
the MAPK/ERK pathway is modulated by timing, duration, and intensity of its signal. Winters et al examined the
MAPK/ERK cascade at different times points in colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines under the combination of
carboxyamido-triazole, an intracellular calcium regulator,
plus the selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor celecoxib.

Suppression of ERK activation occurred in the first hour
of treatment, in contrast to the sustained ERK phosphorylation after 9 days of treatment.24 Indeed, cells interpret
and respond differently to small changes in the levels of
MAPK/ERK activation. As described by Murphy et al, cFOS, an early gene product of MAPK/ERK activation,
works as a sensor of the duration of ERK stimulation.
When the MAPK/ERK signal is transient, c-FOS is unstable and degraded in the nucleus; but, if the signal is sustained, then c-FOS is phosphorylated, and specific
domains are exposed, promoting more ERK activation.25
The procarcinogenic or proapoptotic signaling of this
pathway depends on the timing and duration of MAPK/
ERK activation.
Specific proteins, such as kinase suppressor Ras-1
(KSR1), work as the main scaffold for proteins related to
MAPK/ERK pathway activation. Cytoplasmic proteins,
Sprouty and Spred, directly inhibit the pathway26 by
removing activating phosphate groups from ERK, thereby
decreasing its ability to phosphorylate its substrates.12
Thus, there are regulatory events in both the cytoplasm
and the nucleus, along with spatial and temporal regulation, that fine tune the output of the MAPK/ERK
pathway.
Overactivated and Oncogenic Drivers of the
MAPK Pathway as Therapeutic Targets

Cellular proliferation is driven by an intricate network of
regulated, interdependent signals. The complexity of the
MAPK pathway is not random; it allows for the periodic
environmental adaptation necessary for activation and
regulation of the coordinated events critical for cell survival.27 MAPK/ERK pathway activation and subsequent
interactions are highly regulated processes that are deregulated in cancer cells. Stimulation of growth factor receptors in the cell membrane leads to activation of 2 different
but interconnected, pivotal pathways: the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signal, which causes activation of
protein kinase B (AKT) and its downstream substrates,
and the MAPK/ERK pathway (Fig. 1). Both drive cell
proliferation, survival, and dissemination. The PI3K/
AKT pathway also promotes anabolism; whereas the
MAPK/ERK pathway is more active in proliferation and
invasion.5 Up-regulation of MAPK/ERK signaling occurs
as a result of overexpression or aberrant activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or their immediate downstream targets: PI3K, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein
kinase Src (SRC), and RAS.
Normal MAPK/ERK function is also responsible for
tumor suppression through the induction of senescence

Figure 1. This is a model of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway. After membrane receptor activation, adaptor proteins recruit RAS proteins to activate steps that conclude with ERK activation.
Successive steps of phosphorylation amplify the signal, Raf!MAPK kinase (MEK)!ERK, until ERK activates its cytoplasmic and/
or nuclear targets. Regulatory phosphatases, Sprouty and Spred, modulate the intensity of the signal. The phosphatidylinositol-3kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway interacts with the MAPK/ERK node under normal conditions and in the cancer cell.
Target cytoplasmic proteins include ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and adhesion molecule L1
(LI). Additional proteins in the nucleus include copalyl diphosphate synthase 2 (CPS2) and 90-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase

and the ubiquitinization and degradation of proteins necessary for cell cycle activity and survival.28 Senescence
involves the inhibition of cell proliferation through terminal cell cycle arrest.29 Abnormal activation of MAPK/
ERK by RAS causes degradation of proteins required for
both migration and progression through the cell cycle, as
demonstrated in a model of normal fibroblasts and validated in benign prostate tumors. In those tumors, high
levels of phosphorylated (phospho)-ERK were coexpressed with markers of senescent p16INK4a and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), a marker of protein
degradation.28 In addition, a screening study using a panel
of silencing RNAs (shRNAs) against MEK1 increased
lymphoma genesis in MYC-expressing lymphoid cells,

demonstrating that MEK1 has tumor suppressor properties and that the function of MEK1 kinase is contextdependent.30
Genetic mutations can dysregulate kinase activity
and hyperactivate the MAPK pathway during induction
and progression of tumorigenesis. Many oncogenic driver
mutations have been identified in genes upstream of
MAPK/ERK, varying across cancer types, as indicated in
Table 1. These may include exon 21 mutations in EGFR
or del19EGFR, mutations in v-Ki-ras Kirsten rat sarcoma
viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), and the classic valine to
glutamic acid (V600E) BRAF mutation. These mutated
genes lead to downstream overactivation of the MAPK/
ERK pathway. In general, mutations affecting the

MAPK/ERK pathway are singular, independent events.
Infrequently, 2 mutations can be identified in the RAS/
RAF/MEK/ERK pathway within the same tumor, demonstrating tumoral molecular heterogeneity.48 The sensitivity of mutation detection depends on the dominant
population of cells represented in the tumor sample that is
tested and, thus, may not be illustrative of the tumor as a
whole.49
Discovery of specific oncogene mutations that activate the MAPK pathway has spurred the development of
targeted therapies that apply to multiple tumor types.
Studies in tumor cells with mutant V600EBRAF have
demonstrated that RAF kinase inhibitors prevent ERK
signaling.50 The selective MEK inhibitor PD0325901
decreased cyclin D1 protein expression, thereby decreasing cell proliferation in BRAF-mutant melanoma xenograft models.51 High plasma concentrations of the RAF
inhibitor vemurafenib are associated with strong ERK
pathway inhibition. Patients with advanced-stage,
V600EBRAF-mutated, metastatic melanoma receiving
vemurafenib treatment who achieved >80% inhibition of
cytoplasmic ERK phosphorylation, as observed in paired
pretreatment and on-treatment biopsy samples, demonstrated clinical evidence of partial remission.52 Recently,
the immunomodulatory effects of BRAF inhibition were
examined, and it was demonstrated that these effects
explained part of the efficacy of vemurafenib in melanoma. BRAF and MEK inhibition increased the expression of melanoma antigens in melanoma cell lines. This
could increase T-cell recognition of the tumor, leading to
a successful immunotherapeutic approach.53
The next proteins downstream, MEK1 and MEK2,
have now been successfully targeted. Selumetinib

exhibited some activity in metastatic biliary cancers in a
study of 28 patients, yielding a response rate of 12% and a
progression-free survival of 3.7 months. Only 2 patients
had RAS mutations, and neither responded to therapy.54
Selumetinib was also studied in 24 patients who had metastatic papillary or poorly differentiated thyroid cancer
that was refractory to radioiodine treatment. Selumetinib
increased the iodine-124 uptake in 12 patients, and 5 of 8
patients had responses to radioiodine. Mutations were
detected in 7 of the 8 patient treated; responses were
reported in 4 patients who had neuroblastoma RAS viral
oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutations and in 1 patient
who had a BRAF mutation.55 Docetaxel with or without
selumetinib was studied in a randomized phase 2 trial of
87 patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
who had KRAS mutations. The response rate was 37% in
the experimental arm versus 0% in the arm without selumetinib (P<.0001), and the progression-free survival was
5.3 months versus 2.1 months, respectively (P5.014).56
Currently, many ongoing phase 2 clinical trials are exploring the use of agents targeting BRAF (Table 2) and MEK
kinases (Table 3). Many of those trials apply mutational
analyses for study eligibility to enrich for patients who
may be most likely to benefit. Data suggest that this pathway behavior is not consistent in all settings, which makes
targeting the addictive oncogenic pathway a challenge
across different tumor types.
The MAPK/ERK pathway is a double-edged sword.
Generally, therapeutic inhibition of elements within this
pathway has yielded some benefit. However, small molecule inhibitor therapy aimed at specific protein targets
within the MAPK/ERK pathway has resulted in the development of secondary malignancies. RAF inhibitors, as a

class, may cause abnormal skin cell proliferation, leading
to keratoacanthomas or squamous cell cancers in approximately 10% to 20% of patients.57-59 The development of
these lesions is caused by paradoxical activation of the normal MAPK/ERK pathway in the genomically normal skin
keratinocytes.59 The combination of BRAF and MEK
inhibitors in metastatic melanoma resulted in improved
treatment safety by counterbalancing activation of the
normal MAPK/ERK pathway, yielding a marked reduction in the frequency of the paradoxical oncogenic skin
changes.60,61 The combination of dabrafenib (a BRAF kinase inhibitor) with trametinib (an MEK inhibitor)
caused keratoacanthomas in 7% of patients along with
rare squamous cell skin cancers compared with a frequency of 19% for dabrafenib alone.60 This safer combination is now under evaluation in numerous other
cancers.
MAPK/ERK Pathway Susceptibility Varies by
Tumor Type

Different morphomolecular human tumors have demonstrated unexpected differential responses to signal interruption and may develop unique mechanisms of primary
and secondary resistance (Table 4).82-84 CRC and lowgrade serous ovarian cancers harbor the same mutations
that are observed in melanoma, KRAS and BRAF, but
have very different responses to inhibition of the
3450

MAPK/ERK pathway (Fig. 2). Thus, the relative importance of MAPK/ERK in cancer cells depends on the cell
and/or tissue of origin, the magnitude of addictive dependence on the pathway, and the mechanisms of escape
or alternative signaling.
Melanoma

The success of RAF kinase inhibition was a turning point
in the treatment of melanoma. However, as with other
agents, resistance to treatment occurred and was mapped
to the MAPK/ERK pathway. Primary resistance to
vemurafenib in V600EBRAF melanomas can occur
through increased cellular proliferation in response to loss
of function of tumor suppressors or dysregulation of
mechanisms that prevent apoptosis. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deficiency is a major mechanism
through which the prosurvival AKT signaling pathway
becomes constitutively activated. This was observed in
melanoma cell lines treated with vemurafenib. This
PTEN deficiency was accompanied by loss of induction
of the proapoptotic BIM/BCL2L11 protein and resulted
in primary resistance in these cell lines.71 Selective cytoplasmic redistribution of the transcription factor
FOXO3a led to decreased transcription of proapoptotic
proteins.85,86 These findings, coupled with the reality that
not every mutation-positive tumor will respond to B-RAF
inhibitor therapy despite activating mutations in BRAF,
underscores the need for future research into mechanisms
of primary resistance.
It has been observed that tumors with oncogenic
driver mutations in the MAPK/ERK pathway progress despite an initial response to targeted intervention (secondary resistance). Multiple secondary mechanisms of
resistance have been identified in melanoma, including
new activating mutations in MAPK/ERK pathway genes87
and NRAS,73 increased dimers of splice variants of wildtype BRAF,50,74,88 amplification of wild-type BRAF and
MEK,72 and increased CRAF.89 New studies have demonstrated that C-RAF activates the MAPK/ERK pathway
through the acquisition of secondary mutations that
increase its half-life, avoiding degradation and allowing
heterodimerization with B-RAF.90 Many of these mechanisms result in paradoxical hyperactivation of ERK.13
Intratumoral heterogeneity allows multiple mechanisms
to be identified within a single patient’s tumor, such as
unique mutations in NRAS and an alternative splice variant of BRAF.91 These findings support the concept that
tumors demonstrate clonal evolution and plasticity over
time, adapting to microenvironment and pharmacologic
exposures.92

CRC

Targeted kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that have been beneficial in melanoma have not yielded similar activity in
patients with CRC. RAF signaling is downstream of RAS
in the MAPK/ERK pathway, such that the presence of
BRAF and KRAS mutations in CRC should lead to sensitivity to RAF-targeted agents and circumvent the inhibition of upstream signals, such as those emanating from
receptor kinases. Consistent with the latter expectation,
investigators demonstrated that BRAF and KRAS mutations were negative predictors of deriving a benefit from
cetuximab and panitumumab (EGFR inhibitor therapy)
in phase 3 clinical trials.93,94 Those patients were not

predisposed to susceptibility to inhibitor therapy like
patients with melanoma. It is now routine clinical practice
to test for KRAS mutation before the initiation of EGFR
inhibitors. Thus, rather than functioning as therapeutic
targets in CRC, these genomic events in the MAPK/ERK
pathway are validated negative predictive biomarkers for
EGFR inhibitor intervention.
CRC resistance to B-RAF inhibition has been attributed to differential activation of EGFR in the cell membrane, reinforcing the differential relevance of EGFR
expression across tumor types. Treatment of BRAF-mutant CRC cell lines with vemurafenib resulted in a strong
increase in 1068Y-EGFR phosphorylation and receptor
activation through inhibition of cell division cycle 25C
(CDC25C) phosphatase, which regulates 1068Y-EGFR
phosphorylation. Blockade of MAPK/ERK by BRAF or
MEK inhibitors prevented CDC25C activation, resulting
in increased 1068Y-EGFR and subsequent activation of
other downstream pathways, such AKT. EGFR suppression combined with vemurafenib markedly inhibited proliferation in CRC cells and may be a mechanism to
increase clinical activity.76
Cross-communication between the MAPK/ERK
pathway and parallel pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT
and wingless-type/calcium (Wnt-Ca21) pathways, is critical to abnormal proliferation and therapy resistance.
These parallel pathways are activated when the MAPK/
ERK pathway is attenuated, and they drive cellular proliferation. The inhibition of PI3K or AKT or the use of
hypomethylating agents that secondarily block AKT signaling can overcome this mechanism of resistance in
vitro.78 Understanding of mechanisms of induction of
parallel signaling is needed to guide development of combination therapies. Recently, Spreafico et al demonstrated
a potential role of the noncanonical Wnt/Ca21 signaling
pathway in overcoming resistance of CRC to MEK inhibitors using cyclosporine (a Wnt/Ca11 modulator) in a
model of patient-derived tumor xenografts.79 Those models demonstrated that drug combinations blocking both a
targeted pathway and its associated counter-regulatory
signal can effectively abrogate resistance of CRC to BRAF
or MEK inhibitors.
Ovarian cancer

Ovarian cancers can be classified into distinct types, some
of which are characterized by genetic mutations that may
involve the MAPK/ERK pathway. Type II ovarian cancers
include high-grade serous tumors, and defects in DNA
repair through the loss of normal p53 regulation are
observed in almost all tumors.95,96 Type I ovarian tumors

include low-grade serous and endometrioid, clear cell,
mucinous, and borderline tumors (BOTs); low-grade serous tumors have mutations in KRAS (27%-36%), BRAF
(33%-50%), and PIK3CA; whereas nearly all mucinous
tumors may have KRAS mutations.41,42,97 One study
reported that 57% of BOTs or low-grade serous tumors
3452

had V600BRAF or KRAS codon 12 mutations. It is interesting to note that, in 1 study, patients who had BRAF
mutations had no recurrence after a median follow-up of
3.6 years.98 Ho et al observed KRAS or BRAF mutations
in 86% of cystadenomas adjacent to BOTs, and 88% of
BOTs had mutations.99 There is a loss of frequency of

BRAF and KRAS mutations in the transition from nonmalignant to malignant disease, from cystadenoma or BOT,
to invasive low-grade serous cancer. The mechanism of
this selective process, in which there is loss of an otherwise
recognized oncogenic mutation during the process of acquisition of an invasive phenotype, is unknown. This is
the only example we identified in which there was such
loss of a perceived gain-of-function mutation.
The identification of these mutations led to the logical hypothesis that such ovarian neoplasms were a new
frontier for experimentation with targeted BRAF and
MEK inhibitor therapy. Gynecologic Oncology Group
Study 239, which was a phase 2 trial of the MEK inhibitor
selumetinib in 52 previously treated patients with
low-grade serous ovarian tumors, yielded a 15% overall
response rate and a median progression-free survival of 11
months. This was compared with an historical
progression-free survival of 7 months. Mutational analyses were performed in tumors from 34 patients, and KRAS
and BRAF mutations were found in 41% and 6%, respectively, although mutations did not correlate with response
or longer progression-free survival.100 These examples
argue against a preponderant role of the MAPK/ERK
pathway as a targeting oncogenic driver in these tumors
despite the presence of mutations. Studies of sorafenib
predominantly in patients with recurrent, high-grade
serous ovarian cancer did not demonstrate biochemical
activity of reduced ERK activation pretreatment or ontreatment, perhaps consistent with the lack of genomic
events in the MAPK/ERK pathway in those tumors.101
Interactions between the MAPK/ERK pathway and
estrogen receptor-a (ERa) have also been identified in
preclinical studies. MEK inhibition caused an increase in
ERa expression independent of AKT signaling in ovarian cell lines that were positive for ERa. The addition of
the ER inhibitor fulvestrant caused synergistic suppression of tumor growth in vitro and in an in vivo model.81
This may be a direction for clinical study using modulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway to secondarily regulate
a parallel pathway. This reinforces how ovarian cancer is
a challenging environment in which to study the tumorspecific effects of MAPK/ERK pathway activation. Its
broad range of cellular diversity and complexity of pathway activation lends itself to combination therapy, necessitating greater understanding of the interaction of the
pathways.
Conclusion

The downstream MAPK/ERK signaling node, which is
activated predominantly by upstream SRC/RAS/RAF
Cancer

signaling, is also regulated by modulation through parallel
pathways. This creates a complexity within and between
tumors that impedes the ability to translate therapeutic
findings across tumors. Tissue and subtype specificity in
signaling adds a level of complexity to the application of
novel targeted agents, even against an otherwise dominant
pathway. The MAPK/ERK pathway stimulates cellular
proliferation and invasion; however, its activation also can
increase cellular apoptosis or antagonize pro-oncogenic
input from other signals. The MAPK/ERK pathway demonstrates both oncogene and tumor suppressor, effects
depending on the tissue-specific tumor microenvironment. Although cancers share common mutations, different cell types have developed unique responses to the
mutations. These mutations may behave as oncogenic
drivers, passenger mutations, or regulatory events. The
role of the MAPK/ERK pathway in the tumor microenvironment has long been recognized. This pathway is critical in the process of physiologic and malignant invasion
and angiogenesis; and, most recently, a clear role for
MAPK/ERK has been demonstrated in tumor-immune
system interactions. Hence, MAPK/ERK activation is a
multifaceted target under varied regulatory bodies. Regulatory mechanisms may lead to the activation of alternative pathways and paradoxical hyperactivation of the
normal MAPK/ERK pathway. One unintended and
unexpected consequence of KRAS/BRAF inhibitor drug
therapy is increased activity of the normal MAPK/ERK
pathway, which can lead to the development of secondary
malignancies. Some novel combination therapies have
demonstrated increased treatment efficacy by addressing
both a specific target and its counter-regulatory effect in
the complex milieu of cellular signaling. In shaping future
approaches toward personalized medicine, the challenge is
clear: we must strike a delicate balance between exploiting
shared genetic targets and acknowledging the unique features of human cancers.
