Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cancer cells elude anti-tumour immunity through multiple mechanisms, including upregulated
expression of ligands for inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors1,2. Phagocytosis by
macrophages plays a critical role in cancer control3–6. Therapeutic blockade of signal regulatory
protein (SIRP)-α, an inhibitory receptor on macrophages, or of its ligand CD47 expressed on
tumour cells, improves tumour cell elimination in vitro and in vivo7–10, suggesting that blockade
of the SIRPα–CD47 checkpoint could be useful in treating human cancer11–14. However, the
prophagocytic receptor(s) responsible for tumour cell phagocytosis is(are) largely unknown. Here
we find that macrophages are much more efficient at phagocytosis of haematopoietic tumour cells,
compared with non-haematopoietic tumour cells, in response to SIRPα–CD47 blockade. Using a
mouse lacking the signalling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) family of homotypic
haematopoietic cell-specific receptors, we determined that phagocytosis of haematopoietic tumour
cells during SIRPα–CD47 blockade was strictly dependent on SLAM family receptors in vitro and
in vivo. In both mouse and human cells, this function required a single SLAM family member,
SLAMF7 (also known as CRACC, CS1, CD319), expressed on macrophages and tumour cell
targets. In contrast to most SLAM receptor functions15–17, SLAMF7-mediated phagocytosis was
independent of signalling lymphocyte activation molecule-associated protein (SAP) adaptors.
Instead, it depended on the ability of SLAMF7 to interact with integrin Mac-1 (refs 18–20) and
utilize signals involving immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs21,22. These findings
elucidate the mechanism by which macrophages engulf and destroy haematopoietic tumour cells.
They also reveal a novel SAP adaptor-independent function for a SLAM receptor. Lastly, they
suggest that patients with tumours expressing SLAMF7 are more likely to respond to SIRPα–
CD47 blockade therapy.

Bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were tested for phagocytosis of various
target cells, with blocking anti-CD47 antibodies or control immunoglobulin-G (IgG), using
several assays (Fig. 1a – c and Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). Augmented phagocytosis was seen
with mouse B-cell lineage and myeloid tumour cell lines L1210, CB17–3A8, SP2/0, P815,
and WEHI-3, treated with anti-CD47 antibodies compared with control IgG (Fig. 1d). This
was seen with intact antibodies or F(ab′ )2 fragments of antibodies, implying that it was Fc
receptor (FcR)-independent (Fig. 1e). Similar results were obtained with peritoneal
macrophages (Fig. 1f). Anti-CD47 antibodies had no direct effect on tumour cells (Extended
Data Fig. 1c – f). No effect of anti-CD47 on phagocytosis was seen with T-cell tumour lines,
the mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cell line, and non-haematopoietic cell lines, even though
they expressed CD47 (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 2a). Increased phagocytosis by antihuman CD47 antibodies was also seen with human B-cell tumour cell lines Raji and Daudi,
but not with several non-haematopoietic human tumour cells (Fig. 1h). F(ab′ )2 fragments of
mouse-originated anti-human CD47 antibodies were used to avoid triggering mouse FcRs.
Non-transformed activated mouse T cells bearing the CD4 molecule on their surface (CD4+
T cells), but not thymocytes, freshly isolated CD4+ T cells and B cells, and activated B cells,
also displayed increased phagocytosis in response to anti-CD47 antibodies (Fig. 1i). Thus,
some, but not all, haematopoietic tumour cells and normal cells displayed enhanced
phagocytosis during SIRPα–CD47 blockade, in an FcR-independent manner.

Phagocytosis of tumour cells in response to SIRPα–CD47 blockade was proposed to be
mediated by the LRP-1 receptor, which can recognize calreticulin on tumour cells23.
However, phagocytosis of L1210 and P815 cells was equivalent in control and LRP-1
knockout (KO) macrophages, implying an alternative mechanism (Extended Data Fig. 2b,
c). Since CD47 antibody blockade had the greatest effect on haematopoietic targets, we
tested the involvement of SLAM family receptors (SFRs), a group of homotypic receptors
expressed solely on haematopoietic cells15–17. Macrophages from a mouse lacking all SFRs
(SFR KO mouse) had normal differentiation markers (Extended Data Fig. 3a). However,
they failed to display increased phagocytosis with anti-CD47 antibodies, either intact or as
F(ab′ )2 fragments (Fig. 2a – c and Extended Data Fig. 3b, c). This defect was seen with
mouse and human targets, and with BMDMs and peritoneal macrophages. SFR KO
macrophages also displayed a marked defect in phagocytosis of CD47 KO L1210 cells,
compared with wild-type (WT) macrophages, in the absence of added anti-CD47 antibodies
(Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3d). SFR KO macrophages exhibited normal phagocytosis
of several other types of target, including IgG-opsonized L1210 cells (Extended Data Fig. 3e
– g).

Author Manuscript

Treatment of WT mice with anti-CD47 antibodies, but not control IgG, also resulted in
elimination of L1210 cells introduced in the peritoneal cavity (Fig. 2e). This effect was not
seen in SFR KO mice (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). L1210 clearance was
abrogated by clodronate, implying that it was macrophage-mediated (Fig. 2f and Extended
Data Fig. 4c–e). Additionally, when L1210 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in RAG-1
(recombination-activating gene-1) KO mice, anti-CD47 antibodies significantly reduced
tumour growth, compared with control IgG (Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 4f, g). The antiCD47 antibody-dependent effects were absent in RAG-1 SFR double (d)KO mice (Fig. 2g
and Extended Data Fig. 4f, g). Hence, SFRs were necessary for macrophages to eliminate
tumour cells in response to SIRPα–CD47 blockade in vitro and in vivo. Anti-CD47
antibodies delayed, but did not abolish, tumour growth in mice (Fig. 2g), suggesting that, as
single agent, these antibodies cannot completely control tumour growth in vivo.

Author Manuscript

Five of the six SFRs, namely SLAMF1, 2B4, SLAMF7, Ly-9, and CD84, are expressed on
macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 3a). SLAMF7 single KO macrophages, but not SLAMF1,
2B4, Ly-9, or CD84 single KO macrophages, had a defect in phagocytosis, nearly
comparable to that of SFR KO macrophages (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 5a, b).
Moreover, the defect in phagocytosis of SFR KO macrophages was rescued by re-expression
of mouse Slamf7 using transgenesis (Fig. 3b, c and Extended Data Fig. 5c, d). As SLAMF7
is a homotypic receptor (that is, self-ligand)15–17,24, we also asked whether target cells
susceptible to enhanced phagocytosis in response to anti-CD47 antibodies expressed
SLAMF7. All susceptible target cells expressed SLAMF7 (Fig. 3d). In contrast, none of the
non-susceptible target cells, except normal B cells, did (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Susceptible
targets also expressed other SFR ligands, but macrophages lacking these SFRs showed no
defect in phagocytosis (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 6b). We also found that, unlike WT
activated CD4+ T cells, SLAMF7 KO activated CD4+ T cells did not display increased
phagocytosis by WT macrophages with anti-CD47 antibodies (Fig. 3e). Likewise, when
injected intravenously in WT mice, SLAMF7 KO CD4+ T cells were less efficiently cleared
from the blood in response to anti-CD47 antibodies, compared with WT CD4+ T cells (Fig.

3f). As human target cells were susceptible to phagocytosis by mouse macrophages (Fig.
1h), we also expressed human SLAMF7 in SFR KO macrophages. Expression of human
SLAMF7 conferred an enhanced phagocytosis response during CD47 antibody blockade
(Extended Data Fig. 6c). Lastly, anti-mouse SLAMF7 antibodies 4G2, but not control
antibodies, interfered with anti-CD47 antibody-enhanced engulfment of L1210 cells
(Extended Data Fig. 6d). Similarly, anti-human SLAMF7 antibody 162 blocked the
augmented capacity of human blood-derived macrophages to engulf Raji cells in response to
anti-CD47 antibodies (Fig. 3g). Therefore, SLAMF7 expression on macrophages and
tumour cells was required to endow mouse and human macrophages with the capacity to
phagocytose haematopoietic cells in the presence of anti-CD47 antibodies.

Author Manuscript

SLAMF7 might augment adhesion between macrophages and target cells. However, there
was no defect in conjugate formation between SFR KO macrophages and L1210 cells in the
presence of anti-CD47 antibodies, although a phagocytosis defect was seen at a later time
point (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 7a). SLAMF7 might also promote signals triggering
phagocytosis. In confocal microscopy studies of conjugates in the presence of anti-CD47
antibodies, actin polarization towards target cells, a key step during phagocytosis, was
markedly reduced in SFR KO macrophages (Fig. 4b). Hence, SLAMF7 did not detectably
enhance adhesion to targets, but did stimulate cytoskeletal reorganization required for
phagocytosis.

Author Manuscript

To elucidate how SLAMF7 mediated these effects, we first expressed SLAMF7 in which
three intra-cytoplasmic tyrosines (Y) were mutated to phenylalanines (F) (Y→ F mutations)
in SFR KO macrophages (Fig. 4c). These tyrosines couple SLAMF7 to effectors, including
the SAP adaptor EAT-2 (refs 15–17, 25). The Y→ F mutations had no impact on
phagocytosis (Fig. 4c). In agreement, phagocytosis was unaffected in EAT-2 KO
macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Therefore, SLAMF7 promoted phagocytosis by a
novel SAP adaptor-independent mechanism. We analysed the contributions of various
signalling effectors in SLAMF7-dependent phagocytosis. Pharmacological inhibitors of
three classes of kinases6,21, namely the Src family, Syk, and Btk kinases, abrogated the
enhanced phagocytosis in response to anti-CD47 antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 7c). The
enhanced phagocytosis of L1210 cells with anti-CD47 antibodies was also abrogated in Syk
KO macrophages (Fig. 4d), and reduced in macrophages from mice with X-linked
immunodeficiency26, which carry a loss-of-function mutation in Btk (Fig. 4e). Loss of Syk
or the X-linked immunodeficiency mutation had no impact on macrophage markers,
although they caused defects in phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized targets, as expected22
(Extended Data Fig. 7d, e). Hence, SLAMF7-dependent phagocytosis required Src, Syk, and
Btk kinases, and this effect was macrophage-intrinsic for at least Syk and Btk.

Author Manuscript

These findings suggested that SLAMF7 might promote phagocytosis by using
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing proteins, which mediate
immune cell activation via Src, Syk, and Btk kinases21,22. Macrophages express two ITAMcontaining proteins, DAP12 (DNAX-activation protein of 12 kDa) and FcR-associated-γ
(FcRγ)22. Whereas no defect in anti-CD47-dependent phagocytosis of L1210 was seen in
DAP12 KO macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b), a partial defect was seen in FcRγ KO
macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 8c, d). Macrophages lacking both FcRγ and DAP12

displayed a complete defect (Fig. 5a). Absence of DAP12 and FcRγ had no impact on
macrophage markers, with the exception of FcRs CD64 and CD16, which were absent in
FcRγ KO macrophages, as described27 (Extended Data Fig. 8b, d, e). Defects in FcRmediated phagocytosis were also seen in macrophages lacking FcRγ22 (Extended Data Fig.
8d, e). Thus, SLAMF7-dependent phagocytosis was dependent on contributions from FcRγ
and DAP12.

Author Manuscript

ITAM-containing proteins are typically associated with transmembrane receptors, which
recognize extracellular ligands21,22. SLAMF7 lacks a charged transmembrane domain
residue that is needed to bind ITAM-containing subunits. To assess if SLAMF7 might
interact with FcRγ and DAP12 through other receptors, SLAMF7 was immunoprecipitated
from WT macrophages, and associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry.
SLAMF7 immunoprecipitates contained two integrin proteins, α-subunit CD11b (αM) and
β-subunit CD18 (β2), which constitute Mac-1 (refs 18–20) (Extended Data Fig. 9a). SIRPα
was also identified as a SLAMF7-associated protein. Mac-1 and SIRPα were absent from
anti-SLAMF7 immunoprecipitates from SFR KO macrophages. Conversely, SLAMF7 was
identified in anti-CD11b immunoprecipitates from WT, but not CD11b KO, macrophages
(Extended Data Fig. 9b). Anti-CD11b immunoprecipitates from WT macrophages also
contained other receptors, but no other SFRs. As the other receptors found in CD11b
immunoprecipitates were not seen in SLAMF7 immunoprecipitates, the complexes of
CD11b with SLAMF7 or these other receptors were presumably independent. CD64 and
CD16 were equally present in anti-CD11b immunoprecipitates from WT and CD11b KO
macrophages, implying that these co-immunoprecipitations were non-specific (Extended
Data Fig. 9c).

Author Manuscript

Mac-1 is known to interact with FcRγ and DAP12 (refs 21, 22). It has multiple broadly
expressed ligands such as ICAM-1 and promotes phagocytosis of various types of target,
including pathogens. It is also known as complement receptor 3 (CR3), owing to its ability
to bind targets opsonized by inactive C3b complement (C3bi)18–20,28. The association
between SLAMF7 and CD11b and their co-localization on the cell surface were confirmed
by immunoblot (Fig. 5b) and confocal microscopy (Fig. 5c), respectively, using the
macrophage cell line RAW264.7 expressing Flag-tagged SLAMF7 (Extended Data Fig. 9d).
Co-localization of SLAMF7 with CD11b was especially dense at areas of cell–cell contact
and associated with foci of SLAMF7 accumulation (Fig. 5c).

Author Manuscript

Antibody blockade of CD11b or CD18, but not of integrins CD11a (αL; LFA-1), CD11c
(αX), CD29 (β1), or CD61 (β3), significantly attenuated the enhancement of L1210
phagocytosis by anti-CD47 antibodies (Fig. 5d). Anti-CD47 antibody-induction of L1210
cell phagocytosis was also severely compromised in CD11b KO macrophages, but not in
CD11a KO macrophages (Fig. 5e and Extended Data Fig. 9e, f). In keeping with the ability
of Mac-1 to bind C3bi28, CD11b KO macrophages displayed reduced anti-CD47 antibodyinduced phagocytosis of C3bi-opsonized, but not of IgG-opsonized, L1210 cells (Extended
Data Fig. 9g). SFR KO macrophages did not display a defect in phagocytosis of C3biopsonized L1210 cells in the presence of anti-CD47 (Extended Data Fig. 9h). Therefore,
Mac-1 expression on macrophages was required for SLAMF7-dependent phagocytosis of

tumour cells, but Mac-1 did not display a reciprocal requirement of SLAMF7 for
phagocytosis of C3bi-opsonized targets.

To ascertain which human haematological tumours may be susceptible to SLAMF7dependent phagocytosis during SIRPα–CD47 blockade therapy, expression datasets of
primary human haematological malignancies were extracted for SLAMF7 and CD47. Acute
myelogenous leukaemia, acute lymphocytic leukaemia, and chronic myelogenous leukaemia
expressed lower median levels of SLAMF7, although some individual samples had higher
levels (Extended Data Fig. 10a, b). In contrast, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,
myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma had
higher levels of SLAMF7 (Extended Data Fig. 10a – c). CD47 was uniformly expressed at
high levels in all tumour types, including samples displaying higher levels of SLAMF7
(Extended Data Fig. 10a – d). Thus, some haematological cancers, in particular chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, multiple myeloma, and diffuse large Bcell lymphoma, frequently co-expressed high levels of SLAMF7 and CD47.

Author Manuscript

The mechanisms by which therapeutic agents opposing immune tolerance mediate their antitumour effect remain poorly understood1,2,11,12,14. Here we show that macrophages
selectively phagocytosed haematopoietic tumour cells in response to SIRPα–CD47
checkpoint blockade, in an FcR-independent manner. Phagocytosis was mediated by the
homotypic, haematopoietic cell-specific receptor SLAMF7 (refs 15–17, 24, 25). It also
required expression of integrin Mac-1, and of ITAM-containing subunits FcRγ and DAP12
(refs 21, 22). Our finding that Mac-1-blocking antibodies prevented phagocytosis of
haematopoietic tumour cells implies that, like SLAMF7, Mac-1 plays a direct role in target
cell recognition, although the ligands of Mac-1 in this setting are unidentified. Thus, we
propose that SLAMF7 synergizes with Mac-1 both to recognize ligands on target cells and
to generate signals leading to phagocytosis. Normal B cells, which highly express SLAMF7
and CD47, are not susceptible to enhanced phagocytosis during SIRPα–CD47 blockade.
This is possibly due to lack of relevant ligands for Mac-1, or expression of ligands for
inhibitory receptors other than SIRPα.

Author Manuscript

Given the broad tissue distribution and wide range of Mac-1 ligands, the more narrowly
expressed SLAMF7 probably determines which tumour cells are engulfed by phagocytes in
response to SIRPα–CD47 blockade. Hence, patients with SLAMF7-positive malignancies
may benefit more from SIRPα–CD47 blockade therapy. Our analyses of public datasets and
other published data (reviewed in ref. 24) show that SLAMF7 is more expressed in
haematological cancers such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome,
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Clinical trials testing the impact of
SIRPα–CD47 blockade in some of these malignancies are underway (https://
clinicaltrials.gov).

METHODS

elsewhere29. In essence, SFR KO mice were created by deletion of the entire 400 kilobase

(kb) Slam locus in Bruce 4 C57BL/6 embryonic stem cells. Mice were subsequently
backcrossed to the C57BL/6 background for six to ten generations. To produce mice lacking
SLAMF1 (Slamf1−/−), DNA fragments encoding SLAMF1 were amplified by PCR from a
BAC clone derived from 129S1/Sv mice. The 5′ and 3′ genomic fragments were then
cloned on either side of neo in the vector pJA1617. DNA was then transfected into the 129
mouse embryonic stem-cell line R1, and cells were selected with G418. After removal of the
neo cassette by transient transfection of the Flpe recombinase, positive clones were injected
into blastocysts. The resulting chimaeric mice were crossed with 129S1/Sv mice. Slamf7
BAC transgenic mice (SLAMF7 BAC Tg) were generated using the BAC clone RP23–
145F9. The BAC clone was modified using DNA recombineering, to eliminate the Slamf1
gene and introduce a stop codon in Slamf2, the gene coding for CD48 (Extended Data Fig.
5c). It was then injected into B6-C3H F1 fertilized oocytes to generate SLAMF7 BAC Tg
mice. Mice were then bred with SFR KO mice to create SFR KO-SLAMF7 BAC Tg mice.
Mice lacking Ly-9 (Slamf3−/−) in the 129S1/Sv background, and mice lacking EAT-2
(Sh2d1b1−/−) in the C57BL/6 back-ground, were described previously30,31. The following
mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA): CD84 KO
(Slamf5−/−); CD11b KO (Itgam−/−); CD11a KO (Itgal−/−), CD47 KO (Cd47−/−); LRP-1
conditional KO (Lrp1fl/fl); Lyz2-Cre; RAG-1 KO (Rag1−/−); NRG
(NOD;Rag1−/−IL2Rγc−/−), which are NOD congenic mice lacking T cells, B cells, and
natural killer (NK) cells; X-linked immunodeficient mice (in the CBA/CaHN background),
which carry a loss-of-function point mutation in Btk26; and T-cell-deficient mice (B6.129P2Tcrbtm1Mom Tcrdtm1Mom/J). Mice lacking Syk in bone marrow cells were generated by
transplantation of fetal liver from Syk−/− mice into irradiated RAG-deficient mice32. Mice
lacking FcRγ (Fcer1g−/−) were obtained from Taconics (Hudson, New York, USA). Mice
lacking DAP12 (Tyrobp−/−) were provided by T. Takai33. Mice devoid of FcRγ and DAP12
(Fcer1g−/−;Tyrobp−/−) were reported elsewhere34. All mice were maintained in the C57BL/6
background, unless specified. They were also kept in a specific pathogen-free environment.
Either males or females were used, typically 8–12 weeks of age. Littermates were used as
controls in all experiments, except for the studies involving Syk KO, FcRγ KO, FcRγ–
DAP12 dKO, and X-linked immunodeficient mice, where WT syngeneic mice were used.
Animal experimentation was approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Institut de
recherches cliniques de Montréal and performed as defined by the Canadian Council of
Animal Care (A.V.), or by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of California at San Francisco, in accordance with the recommendations in the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health
(C.A.L.). For experiments with mice, sample size was chosen on the basis of previous
studies in this field and to achieve statistical significance. No randomization or blinding was
performed. No animals were excluded from the analyses.
Cells and retroviral infection
Mouse BMDMs were produced as described elsewhere35. In brief, femora and tibiae were
flushed with tissue culture medium and propagated in bacterial Petri dishes for ~7 days, in
medium supplemented with 30% (v/v) L929 cell-conditioned medium as a source of colonystimulating factor 1. Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were generated as
outlined elsewhere35. In our initial studies, we used L1210 (B-cell lymphocytic leukaemia),

YAC-1 (thymoma), B16 (melanoma), CMT-93 (rectal carcinoma), RAW264.7 (v-Abltransformed monocyte/ macrophage), and L929 (immortalized fibroblast) from stocks
described previously30,35–38. Moreover, Raji (B-cell lymphoma) and Daudi (B-cell
lymphoma) were provided by J. Di Noia, whereas Colo205 (colon carcinoma), SW480
(colon carcinoma), and SW620 (colon carcinoma) were provided by N. Rivard. Cells were
sporadically tested for mycoplasma and found to be negative. Haematopoietic cells were
authenticated by flow cytometry. Subsequently, L1210 (CCL-219), P815 (TIB-64), WEHI-3
(TIB-68), SP2/0 (CRL-1581), BW5147.3 (TIB-47), EL-4 (TIB-39), YAC-1 (TIB-160), B16
(CRL-6475), CMT-93 (CCL-223), L929 (CCL-1), Raji (CCL-86), Daudi (CCL-213),
Colo205 (CCL-222), SW480 (CCL-228), and SW620 (CCL-227) were freshly obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Virginia, USA), while MEL (96121718)
and RAW264.7 (91062702) were freshly obtained from the European Collection of
Authenticated Cell Cultures (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA). The American Type
Culture Collection and the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures authenticated
these cell lines and showed that they were negative for mycoplasma. RMA-S was obtained
from the institute that initially generated this cell line (provided through B. Chambers). They
were mycoplasma-negative. No cell lines used in this paper are listed in the database of
commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by the International Cell Line Authentication
Committee. CD47 KO L1210 cells were generated using CRISPR–Cas-mediated genome
editing, using the guide RNA sequences CACCGAGCAACAGCGCCGCCGCCAA and
CACCGTTGGCGGCGGCGCTGTTGCT. Thymocytes and freshly isolated CD4+ T cells
were isolated as detailed previously36. Activated CD4+ T cells were obtained by stimulating
purified splenic CD4+ T cells with concanavalin A (4 µg ml−1; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 days,
followed by IL-2 (50 U ml−1) for 3 days. Unstimulated B cells were obtained by isolating
total splenocytes from T-cell-deficient mice, whereas activated B cells were obtained by
stimulating purified B cells with lipopolysaccharide (5µ g ml−1) for 5 days. Purity of T cells
and B cells was greater than 90%. BMDMs or RAW264.7 cells were infected with
retroviruses (using the vector pFB–GFP) encoding various SLAMF7 proteins, in
combination with GFP. Retroviruses encoding GFP alone were used as control. For
BMDMs, GFP-positive cells were purified by cell sorting 48 h after infection and
propagated for an additional 48 h in growth medium, before experimentation. For
RAW264.7, GFP-positive cells were isolated by cell sorting, when sufficient numbers of
cells were available. The constructs encoding mouse SLAMF7 Y→ F mutant
(Y261F;Y266F;Y281F) and Flag-tagged mouse SLAMF7 were created by PCR. L1210
derivatives expressing Tac (CD25) were generated by transfection, using a plasmid (pSRαpuro) encoding a cytoplasmic domain-deleted version of CD25 fused to the transmembrane
domain of 2B4. Transfected cells were selected in medium containing puromycin and
purified by cell sorting. Human blood samples were collected from healthy donors following
informed consent for the McGill University Health Centre Institutional Review Boardapproved research protocol GEN10–256. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were then
isolated using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were seeded for 1–3 h at

fragments of anti-mouse CD47 monoclonal antibody (Miap301), anti-human CD47
monoclonal antibody (B6H12), anti-human SLAMF7 monoclonal antibody (162), and
control IgG were generated using pepsin (Sigma-Aldrich), according to standard protocols.
Purity and integrity of F(ab′)2 fragments were confirmed by protein gel electrophoresis. For
immunoprecipitations and immunoblots, the following antibodies were used: anti-Syk and
anti-SLAMF7 rabbit antisera (generated in our laboratory40,41), anti-β-actin (C4; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California, USA), anti-DAP12 (D7G1X; New England Biolabs,

(monoclonal antibody EPR1344; Abcam), and anti-β-actin (monoclonal antibody AC-74,
Sigma-Aldrich).
In vitro phagocytosis assays

Author Manuscript

For the microscopy-based assay, 5 × 104 macrophages were seeded overnight in a 24-well
tissue culture plate. The next day, target cells were washed and labelled with 2.5 µM of
carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE), using a CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit
(C34554; Life Technologies, Burlington, Ontario, Canada). After incubating macrophages in
serum-free medium for 2 h, 2 × 105 CFSE-labelled target cells were added to the
macrophages, in the presence of anti-CD47 antibodies or control IgG (10 µg ml−1). After
incubation for 2 h at 37°C, macrophages were extensively washed and imaged with an
inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Axiovert S100 TV). The phagocytosis efficiency was
calculated as the number of macrophages containing CFSE+ target cells per 100
macrophages. For the flow cytometry-based assay, macrophages were prepared and then

incubated with Tac-expressing L1210 cells as targets, as detailed for the microscopy assay,
except that targets were labelled with 0.2 µM of CFSE. Once the phagocytosis period was
completed, all cells in the well were collected in the presence of Accutase. Cells were then
stained on ice for 30 min with APC-conjugated anti-human Tac (CD25) and phycoerythrinconjugated monoclonal antibody F4/80, and analysed by flow cytometry. After gating on
F4/80+Tac− cells (which included macrophages but excluded non-phagocytosed Tac-positive
L1210 cells), phagocytosis efficiency was determined as the percentage of F4/80+Tac− cells
containing CFSE-derived green fluorescence (detected in FL1 channel). For the pHrodobased assay, macrophages were prepared and incubated with targets as detailed for the
microscopy assay, except that targets were labelled with 100 ng ml−1 of pHrodo Green AM
Intracellular pH Indicator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. pHrodo dyes are non-fluorescent at neutral pH and
become fluorescent in acidic environments such as phagolysosome. Once the phagocytosis
period was completed, all cells in the well were collected in the presence of Accutase. They
were then stained with APC-conjugated anti-F4/80 and analysed by flow cytometry.
Phagocytosis efficiency was determined as the percentage of F4/80+ cells containing
pHrodo-derived green fluorescence (detected in FL1 channel). For phagocytosis of IgGopsonized tumour cells, L1210 cells expressing Tac (CD25) were opsonized with anti-Tac
monoclonal antibody 7G7 (a mouse IgG2a) for 1 h at 37°C, before the microscopy-based
phagocytosis assay. For phagocytosis of C3bi-opsonized tumour cells, L1210 cells were
incubated with C5-deficient human serum (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37 °C, before the
microscopy-based phagocytosis assay. For phagocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes,
thymocytes (2 × 107 cells per millilitre) from 4- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were treated
at 37 °C for 10 h with 1 µM of dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich), which caused about 70% of
cells to become apoptotic (annexin V-positive). Cells were then labelled with 2.5 µM of
CFSE and incubated with macrophages at a ratio of 20:1 for 30 min at 37 °C. Phagocytosis
was monitored by microscopy. For endocytosis of immune complexes, biotinylated mouse
IgG (eBioscience) was inactivated at 65 °C for 30 min and mixed with phycoerythrincoupled streptavidin (eBioscience) on ice for 30 min, to form immune complexes. Then, IgG
immune complexes were incubated with macrophages at 37 °C for 30 min. A solution of
PBS (pH 2.5) was added to the cell mixture for 1 min at 4 °C, to remove non-endocytosed
immune complexes. Cells were subsequently washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and
analysed by flow cytometry. For phagocytosis of bacteria, GFP-expressing Escherichia coli
(DH5α) were cultured overnight at 37 °C. They were then mixed with macrophages at a
ratio of 100:1 and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min or 30 min. After washing, the mixture was
digested with lysozyme at 37 °C for 30 min, to remove non-phagocytosed bacteria. Then,
cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and analysed by flow cytometry. For
phagocytosis of opsonized sheep red blood cells (sRBCs), sRBCs (MP Biomedicals, Santa
Ana, California, USA) were washed with cold PBS and opsonized with rabbit anti-sRBC
IgG (MP Biomedicals) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. sRBCs were then labelled with PKH26 (SigmaAldrich), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Macrophages and sRBCs were incubated
at a ratio of 1:10 at 37°C for 30 min. After lysing non-phagocytosed sRBCs with RBC lysis
buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), macrophages were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and
analysed by flow cytometry. For phagocytosis of mouse RBCs, freshly isolated mouse RBCs
from WT or CD47 KO mice were labelled with PKH26. After incubating macrophages in

serum-free medium for 2 h, 1 × 106 mouse RBCs were added to the macrophages, as
detailed for the fluorescence microscopy assay. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, nonphagocytosed RBCs were lysed with RBC lysis buffer and macrophages were imaged by
fluorescence microscopy. For experiments with pharmacological inhibitors, macrophages
were incubated with the following pharmacological inhibitors: Btk family kinase inhibitor,
ibrutinib (10 nM; Selleckchem, Burlington, Ontario, Canada); Syk kinase inhibitor, R406
(750 nM; Calbiochem, Burlington, Ontario, Canada); or Src kinase inhibitor, SU6656 (100
nM; 572635; Calbiochem). Inhibitors were added to macrophages 1 h before and during the
phagocytosis assay. They had no deleterious impact on cell viability, as verified by staining
cells with propidium iodide and annexin V (data not shown).
Intraperitoneal tumour clearance assay

Author Manuscript

Mice (6–8 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with 1.5 ml of 4% (w/v) thioglycollate
medium (BD Biosciences). After 4 days, 5 × 106 CFSE-labelled tumour cells (L1210; in 200
µl of PBS) were injected intraperitoneally, in the presence of anti-CD47 or control IgG.
After 24 h, cells in the peritoneal cavity were collected using cold PBS washing buffer
containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 1 mM EDTA. Numbers of remaining CFSE-positive
target cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Numbers of macrophages were also
determined, by staining with anti-F4/80. A fixed number of fluorescent beads (1 × 104; 7.58
µm in diameter; Flow Cytometry Absolute Count Standard, Full Spectrum; Bangs
Laboratories, Fishers, Indiana, USA) was added to one-twentieth of the cell suspension
before flow cytometry. Equivalent numbers of fluorescent beads (2 × 102) were acquired for
standardization of cell numbers. In some experiments, mice were injected intraperitoneally
on days − 1 and 3 with 200 µl of liposomes containing clodronate or PBS (http://
www.clodronateliposomes.com/; Amsterdam, The Netherlands), to deplete macrophages.

Subcutaneous tumour transplantation assay

Author Manuscript

One million L1210 cells (in some cases, expressing GFP) were injected subcutaneously into
the right flank of 6- to 10-week-old RAG-1 KO or RAG-1 SFR dKO mice. RAG-1 KO mice
were used to avoid T-cell-mediated rejection of L1210 cells, which are derived from a mouse
strain (DBA) different from that of SFR KO mice (C57BL/6). Starting on day 4, mice were
injected daily intraperitoneally with 200 µg of control rat IgG2a or rat anti-mouse CD47
(Miap301). Tumour volume was measured every day using a calliper and the formula
(length × width2)/2. Antibody treatment was stopped at day 11 and mice were immediately
killed. Tumour size limit allowed was 1.5 cm in diameter. Experiments were terminated
when or before this size was reached. Tumours were then dissected and weighed. Volumes
were also assessed. Then, tumours were sliced into small pieces and pressed through a
strainer using the plunger end of a syringe. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS with 2%
fetal bovine serum. Total cell numbers were determined, while live cells were enumerated by
staining with trypan blue to exclude dead cells. Tumour cells were detected by flow
cytometry, using the marker GFP, while immune cells were detected by staining with the
relevant antibodies and flow cytometry.

T-cell adoptive transfer

Author Manuscript

Concanavalin A-activated WT and SLAMF7 KO CD4+ T cells were labelled with 5 µM of
CFSE or CellTrace Violet (CTV; Life Technologies), respectively. Then, a 1:1 mixture of
WT and SLAMF7 KO T cells was injected intravenously into WT mice, along with control
IgG or anti-CD47 antibodies. After 24 h, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated
and the presence of CFSE-positive or CTV-positive cells was detected by flow cytometry.
Adhesion assays

Author Manuscript

For the microscopy-based assay, BMDMs (2 × 105) were labelled with CTV and plated
overnight onto cover slips. The next day, target cells (L1210) were labelled with CFSE.
Macrophages and target cells were then mixed at a 1:4 ratio in serum-free culture medium
and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to allow conjugate formation. Cells were subsequently
washed extensively to remove unconjugated cells. Slides were then analysed by LSM 710
laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada).
Conjugates between BMDMs and target cells were counted. For the flow cytometry-based
assay, macrophages were labelled on ice with APC-conjugated anti-F4/80 monoclonal
antibody BM8, while target cells were labelled in a similar way using 0.5 µ M CFSE. After
washing, cells were resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells per millilitre. Conjugate
formation was analysed by mixing macrophages with targets, and by incubating the mixture
for various periods of time at 37 °C, as described31. Conjugates were detected by flow
cytometry.
Stimulation of target cells with anti-CD47 antibodies

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To detect apoptosis, 2 × 105 L1210 or P815 cells were incubated in 24-well plates in the
presence of 10 µg ml−1 of control rat IgG or rat anti-CD47 antibodies. Cells were collected
the next day and cell death was examined by staining with annexin V and propidium iodide,
using an Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit APC (eBioscience). To measure proliferation,
2 × 105 L1210 or P815 cells were labelled with 5 µM CFSE and incubated overnight in cell
culture medium containing 10 µg ml−1 of control rat IgG or rat anti-CD47 antibodies. Cells
were collected the next day and CFSE intensity was analysed by flow cytometry. To probe
calcium flux, L1210 or P815 cells (2 × 106 cells per sample) were loaded with the calcium
indicator dye Indo-1, and then stimulated or not with rat anti-CD47 antibodies and rabbit
anti-rat antibodies. Calcium flux was assessed by flow cytometry, using the FL4/FL5
fluorescence ratio. Ionomycin served as positive control. To study protein tyrosine
phosphorylation, 2 × 106 L1210 or P815 cells were stimulated or not with rat anti-CD47
antibodies plus rabbit anti-rat antibodies. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by
immunoblotting of total cell lysates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (monoclonal
antibody 4G10).
Immunoprecipitations, mass spectrometry, immunoblots
Immunoprecipitations were performed as described42, using Brij99 as detergent in lysis
buffer. Mass spectrometry was performed by the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal
Proteomics Core Facility, as outlined elsewhere43. In brief, immunoprecipitated proteins
were digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) and analysed by liquid

chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a Proxeon nanoelectrospray ion source. A
gradient of 100 min was used for liquid chromatography separation, and standard
proteomics parameters were used for the mass spectrometers. Protein database searching
was performed with Mascot 2.5 (Matrix Science) and data analysis was conducted using
Scaffold (version 3.6). The following criteria were used to select potentially relevant
SLAMF7 interactors: (1) present in SLAMF7 immunoprecipitates from WT, but not from
SFR KO, macrophages; (2) observed in a minimum of four of the five independent SLAMF7
immunoprecipitates from WT macrophages; and (3) a receptor known to regulate
macrophage activation. The following criteria were used to select potentially relevant
CD11b interactors: (1) present in CD11b immunoprecipitates from WT, but not from CD11b
KO, macrophages; (2) observed in a minimum of five of the six independent CD11b
immunoprecipitates from WT macrophages; and (3) a receptor known to regulate
macrophage function. Immunoblots were performed as reported elsewhere44.

RAW264.7 cells expressing Flag–SLAMF7 or GFP alone (3 × 105) were seeded onto glass
cover slips in six-well plates. The next day, cells were fixed in PBS containing 4%
formaldehyde. Subsequently, they were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized for 15
min at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After additional washes, non-specific
staining was prevented by blocking for 30 min in PBS supplemented with 5% bovine serum
albumin. Cells were washed again and incubated for 1 h with anti-CD11b rabbit monoclonal
antibody EPR1344, and anti-Flag mouse monoclonal antibody M2. After further washing,
cells were incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 594-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa
Fluor 488-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After three additional
washes, cover slips were mounted over glass slides using fluorescent mounting medium
(Dako, Markham, Ontario, Canada). Data were acquired using a laser-scanning confocal
microscope LSM-710. To study actin polarization, BMDMs (2 × 105) were stained with
CTV and seeded onto cover slips. The next day, target cells (L1210) were stained with
CFSE. Macrophages and targets were then mixed at a 1:4 ratio in serum-free culture
medium and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to allow conjugate formation. Cells were
subsequently fixed, washed, and permeabilized, and non-specific staining was blocked, as
detailed above for RAW264.7 cells. Then, cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with antiactin mouse monoclonal antibody AC-74 (Sigma-Aldrich). After further washing, they were
incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 594-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Slides were then processed and analysed by confocal microscopy, as detailed
above for RAW264.7 cells. Conjugates with full polarization of actin at the area of contact
between the macrophage and the target cell were quantitated.
Gene expression dataset analyses
Expression of SLAMF7 and CD47 RNA was analysed using public datasets of human
haematological tumours. Normalized data for samples of leukaemia were extracted from the
MILE Study45, whereas normalized data for acute myelogenous leukaemia were obtained
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In both cases, data were downloaded through
Bloodspot46 (http://www.bloodspot.eu). Data for various samples of multiple myeloma were

various samples of acute myelogenous leukaemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were
directly extracted from TCGA, using the ‘TCGAretriever’ R package. Data were plotted and
statistical analyses (unpaired Student’s t-tests (two-tailed)) were performed using the R
software package.
Statistical analyses
Except for the gene expression dataset analyses, unpaired Student’s t-tests (two-tailed) were
performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software). Sample sizes in experiments were chosen on
the basis of sizes reported in this field and to achieve statistical significance.

Extended Data Figure 10. Gene expression analyses of SLAMF7 and CD47

Author Manuscript

Expression of SLAMF7 and CD47 RNA in human haematological tumours. a, RNA levels
of SLAMF7 (top) and CD47 (bottom) in several types and subtypes of leukaemia were
analysed, using data obtained from microarray experiments. Data for only one
oligonucleotide probe are shown. However, similar findings were made with other SLAMF7
and CD47 probes (data not shown). Each symbol represents a different patient sample.
Median expression for a given type or subtype of malignancy is depicted by a horizontal
line. For statistical analysis, Student’s t-tests were performed comparing SLAMF7
expression in the combination of all acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and acute
lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), versus either myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). CML, chronic myelogenous leukaemia. b, Same as a, except
that samples of multiple myeloma (MM) were analysed. c, Same as a, except that samples of
acute myelogenous leukaemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) were studied.
Moreover, RNA expression was quantitated by RNA sequencing. d, Levels of SLAMF7 and
CD47 RNAs for individual samples from selected tumour types, which displayed higher
levels of SLAMF7 RNA, were analysed in parallel using dot plots. ***P < 0.001. The values
of n, from left to right, are (a) MILE Study: 38, 41, 37, 28, 48, 352, 70, 237, 122, 13, 40, 36,
