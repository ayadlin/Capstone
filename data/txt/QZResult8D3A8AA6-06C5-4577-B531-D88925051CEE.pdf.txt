Abstract
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Although aggressive surgery,
radiation, and chemotherapy have improved outcomes, survivors suffer severe long-term side effects, and
many patients still succumb to their disease. For patients whose tumors are driven by mutations in the sonic
hedgehog (SHH) pathway, SHH antagonists offer some hope. However, many SHH-associated medulloblastomas do not respond to these drugs, and those that do may develop resistance. Therefore, more effective
treatment strategies are needed for both SHH and non-SHH–associated medulloblastoma. One such strategy
involves targeting the cells that are critical for maintaining tumor growth, known as tumor-propagating cells
(TPC). We previously identiﬁed a population of TPCs in tumors from patched mutant mice, a model for SHHdependent medulloblastoma. These cells express the surface antigen CD15/SSEA-1 and have elevated levels of
genes associated with the G2–M phases of the cell cycle. Here, we show that CD15þ cells progress more
rapidly through the cell cycle than CD15 cells and contain an increased proportion of cells in G2–M,
suggesting that they might be vulnerable to inhibitors of this phase. Indeed, exposure of tumor cells to
inhibitors of Aurora kinase (Aurk) and Polo-like kinases (Plk), key regulators of G2–M, induces cell-cycle
arrest, apoptosis, and enhanced sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy. Moreover, treatment of tumorbearing mice with these agents signiﬁcantly inhibits tumor progression. Importantly, cells from human
patient-derived medulloblastoma xenografts are also sensitive to Aurk and Plk inhibitors. Our ﬁndings
suggest that targeting G2–M regulators may represent a novel approach for treatment of human medulloblastoma. Cancer Res; 73(20); 6310–22. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric
brain tumor, with the majority of cases occurring in children
under the age of 15 years (1). Patients with medulloblastoma
are commonly treated with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, but survivors suffer severe side effects, including cognitive

and developmental deﬁcits and an increased risk of secondary
tumors later in life (2, 3). Therefore, alternative approaches to
treatment of medulloblastoma are essential.
Recent genomic analyses have identiﬁed four major subtypes
of medulloblastoma that differ from one another in terms of
gene expression, DNA copy number and mutations, epidemiology, and prognosis. Although the genetic drivers of these
subtypes are not fully understood, one group of tumors—
representing approximately 25% of medulloblastoma cases—
is characterized by activation of the sonic hedgehog (SHH)
signaling pathway. In some cases, this activation can be attributed to mutation or ampliﬁcation of known pathway components, including the membrane proteins Patched (PTCH1) and
Smoothened (SMO), the cytoplasmic regulator Suppressor of
Fused (SUFU), and the transcription factors GLI1 and GLI2;
however, in many cases, the basis for SHH pathway activation
remains unclear (4).
Patients with SHH-associated tumors have a variable prognosis, with a subset faring poorly despite aggressive therapy (4).
The development of small-molecule inhibitors of the SHH
pathway has offered some hope for these patients (5, 6). These
agents represent one of the ﬁrst classes of targeted therapies
for medulloblastoma, but they are effective only in patients
with SHH-associated tumors. Importantly, most of these compounds act on SMO and are thus unlikely to be active against

Targeting Aurora and Polo-like Kinases in Medulloblastoma

tumors driven by mutations in downstream components such
as SUFU and GLI (7). Moreover, recent studies in both patients
and animals have shown that PTCH- and SMO-driven tumors
that initially respond to SHH antagonists quickly develop
resistance (6, 8). Thus, more innovative approaches to therapy
are required for SHH-associated medulloblastoma.
One approach for improving treatment of medulloblastoma
may involve targeting tumor-propagating cells (TPC). TPCs,
often called cancer stem cells, are operationally deﬁned as the
cells within a tumor that are capable of regenerating the tumor
upon transplantation into a na€ve host. TPCs have been
identiﬁed in multiple tumor types, including those of the brain,
breast, prostate, colon, pancreas, liver, lung, and skin, among
others (9–16). The ability of TPCs to regenerate tumors has
led to the notion that these cells are responsible for tumor
resistance and recurrence after therapy. Indeed, TPCs have
been shown to display resistance to both chemotherapy and
radiation (17–19). Given this capacity for evading standard
therapies and regenerating tumors, identiﬁcation of therapeutic approaches to target and eliminate these cells could substantially improve patient outcomes.
We recently identiﬁed a population of TPCs in patched
heterozygous mice, a widely studied mouse model of SHHassociated medulloblastoma (20). These cells, which can be
identiﬁed on the basis of their expression of the cell surface
carbohydrate antigen CD15/SSEA-1, are not multipotent and
cannot form neurospheres, but are uniquely capable of propagating tumors following transplantation. When CD15þ cells
are transplanted into the cerebella of na€ve mice, 100% of
recipients develop tumors, whereas CD15 cells never generate
tumors. Expression proﬁling revealed that CD15þ cells display
decreased expression of genes associated with differentiation
and elevated expression of genes associated with proliferation.
CD15 is also found in a subset of human medulloblastomas,
and patients whose tumors express high levels of a CD15associated gene signature have a poorer prognosis.
Because CD15þ cells are critical for tumor propagation, we
hypothesized that further understanding the properties of
these cells might enable us to identify vulnerabilities that could
be targeted by therapeutic intervention. Here, we report that
CD15þ cells from patched mutant tumors display elevated
expression of genes encoding regulators of G2 and M phases of
the cell cycle and a corresponding over-representation of cells
in G2–M phase. Furthermore, inhibition of Aurora kinases
(Aurk) or Polo-like kinases (Plk), important G2–M regulators,
inhibits proliferation in vitro and blocks tumor growth in vivo.
Therefore, targeting TPCs through inhibition of G2–M regulators may represent a novel approach for improving treatment
of patients with this disease.

Materials and Methods
Mice
All animal experiments were done according to protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Duke University (Durham, NC) and the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute (La Jolla, CA). Germline
patched heterozygous mutant mice (21) were maintained by

www.aacrjournals.org

breeding with 1291/SvJ or C57BL/6 mice from The Jackson
Laboratory. Conditional Math1-CreER; Ptcﬂox/ﬂox mice (22)
were treated with 0.8 mg of tamoxifen (T5648; Sigma) in 40 mL
of corn oil at postnatal day 4 to generate tumors 10 to 16 weeks
later. CD-1 Nu/Nu mice were obtained from Charles River
Laboratories, and NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NOD/
scid/gamma; NSG) mice were obtained from The Jackson
Laboratory.
Human tumor isolation and propagation
Human medulloblastoma tissue for patient-derived xenografts was obtained from surgical resection of tumors at Duke
University Medical Center (Durham, NC) or Rady Children's
Hospital (San Diego, CA). All procedures using human tissue
were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the
respective institutions. Upon retrieval, the tissue was mechanically dissociated into a single-cell suspension, then immediately injected into the cerebella of NSG mice. When the mice
became symptomatic, the tumors were again dissociated into
single-cell suspensions and then retransplanted back into the
cerebella of na€ve hosts to establish a propagated line for each
patient-derived xenograft.
Molecular classiﬁcation of human tumors
The tumors were assigned molecular subgroups using a
class prediction algorithm, prediction analysis for microarrays
(PAM; ref. 23), as implemented in the pamr R package (v 1.51).
The RNA expressions of subgroup-speciﬁc markers were measured by a NanoString assay (24) and subsequently used as
features for class prediction. Predicted subgroups with conﬁdence probabilities higher than established thresholds (24)
were considered bona ﬁde subgroup assignments. Principal
component analyses (PCA) plots were generated by PCA on the
training data. The resulting Eigen vectors were used to project
the expression proﬁles of the classiﬁed samples onto the vector
space spanned by the ﬁrst two Eigen vectors of the training
data. The background conﬁdence score gradient was generated using 200 replicates of the training data with Gaussian
noise and subsequently smoothed by Nadaraya-Watson normalization (ﬁelds v6.7.6 R package).
Chemicals
The Aurk inhibitors VX-680, PHA-739358, SNS-314, CYC116,
AT9283, MLN8237, PHA-680602, CCT129202, ENMD-2076, and
AZD1152-HQPA, the Plk inhibitors BI-2536, BI-6727, GSK461364,
and ON-01910, and the chemotherapeutic agents vincristine,
cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide were obtained from Selleck
Chemicals. The SHH antagonist NVP-LDE225 was kindly provided by Novartis.
Tumor cell isolation and culture
Tumors were obtained from germline patched heterozygous or conditional Math1-CreER; Ptcﬂox/ﬂox mice, and each
experiment was done multiple times using cells isolated from
each strain. The complete tumor dissociation procedure has
been described previously (20, 22). Brieﬂy, tumors were digested
in a papain solution to obtain a single-cell suspension, then
centrifuged through a 35% to 65% Percoll gradient. Cells from

the 35% to 65% interface were suspended in Dulbecco's PBS
(DPBS) plus 5% FBS for cell sorting or in NB-NS21 [Neurobasal
with 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and NS-21 supplement (25)] plus 1%
FBS (Invitrogen) for culture. The cells were plated on Growth
Factor–Reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences)–coated plates.
Cell sorting
To obtain CD15þ and CD15 cell populations, cells were
stained with control mouse immunoglobulin M (IgM) or antiCD15 (clone MMA; BD Biosciences) antibodies, followed by
anti-mouse IgM–phycoerythrin (PE; Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cells were then sorted on a FACSVantage or
FACSVantage SE DiVa ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). After
sorting, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in NB-NS21
culture media or frozen until use for expression analysis.
Real-time PCR
Real-time PCR was conducted to examine the mRNA
expression levels of AurkA, AurkB, and Plk1 in the CD15þ and
CD15 populations. mRNA was prepared using an RNeasy kit
(Qiagen, Inc.), and real-time PCR was conducted using the
QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Inc.). Each
reaction consisted of 10 ng of the appropriate RNA, 12.5 mL
of 2 QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR Master Mix, 1.25 mL of
a 10 mmol/L stock of the appropriate forward and reverse
primers, 0.25 mL of QuantiTect RT mix, and RNase-free water
in a total volume of 25 mL. The following primer sequences
were used: AurkA, forward: GTTCCCTTCGGTCCGAAA, reverse: AATCATTTCCGGAGGCTG; AurkB, forward: TCAGAAGGAGAACGCCTACCC, reverse: GACTCTCTGGGACAACGTGTT; Plk1, forward: ACGTCGTAGGCTTCCATGAC, reverse:
CTCGTTCAGGAAGAGGTTGC; and Actin, forward: TATTGGCAACGAGCGGTTCC, reverse: GGCATAGAGGTCTTTACGGATGTC. Duplicate reactions were carried out without the
QuantiTect RT mix to conﬁrm the absence of genomic DNA
contamination. The following reaction conditions were run
on a Bio-Rad C1000 Thermal Cycler and CFX96 Real-time
System (Bio-Rad Laboratories): reverse transcription at 50 C
for 30 minutes, HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase activation at
95 C for 15 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 94 C for 15
seconds, 60 C for 30 seconds, and 72 C for 30 seconds. Each
reaction was analyzed in triplicate using the DCt method to
determine the level of expression of each gene in the CD15þ
population relative to the CD15 population in each tumor.
BrdUrd and cell-cycle analysis
To monitor cell-cycle kinetics, tumor cells were ﬁrst sorted
into CD15þ and CD15 populations as described earlier. After
sorting, 2 million cells per well were plated into 24-well plates
in NB-NS21 culture media. The cells were pulsed with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 30 minutes, then washed with media
to remove any remaining BrdUrd. Cells were collected immediately after the pulse (30 minutes), or 6, 12, or 24 hours later,
then ﬁxed and stained using the ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) BrdU Flow Kit (BD Biosciences) and 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
For cell-cycle analysis of cells that were not labeled with

6312

Cancer Res; 73(20) October 15, 2013

BrdUrd, the same kit was used for ﬁxation, permeabilization,
and 7-AAD staining, but the anti-BrdUrd staining step was
omited. The analysis was conducted using a FACScan
or FACSCanto ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo
v.7.6.4 software (TreeStar, Inc.).
CFSE analysis
As an alternative approach to measure the timing of cell
divisions in CD15þ and CD15 populations, patched mutant
tumor cells were sorted, then labeled with 1 mmol/L carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate (CFSE) at a density of 1  106 cells/mL
using the CellTrace CFSE Cell Proliferation Kit (Invitrogen).
The cells were then cultured for 48, 72, or 96 hours, ﬁxed with
2% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and CFSE ﬂuorescence was analyzed using a FACSCanto ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and
FlowJo v.7.6.4 software (TreeStar, Inc).
Western blotting
To assess the levels of histone H3 phosphorylation following treatment with inhibitors, cells were cultured in 24-well
plates at a density of 2.5 million cells per well in the presence of
the indicated concentrations of DMSO, VX-680, or BI-2536.
Cells were then lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer (Millipore) containing 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
2 mmol/L sodium ﬂuoride (both from Sigma), and complete,
mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied
Science). Proteins (30 mg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen), which
were then probed with antibodies against phospho-histone H3
(Ser 10; Millipore), total histone H3 (Cell Signaling Technology), actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Cell Signaling Technology), followed by goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to
IRdye 680 (Rockland). Proteins were detected using the Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR).
Proliferation and apoptosis assays
To examine the effects of inhibitors on proliferation,
tumor cells from patched mutant mice or patient-derived
xenografts were isolated as described earlier and plated in
96-well plates at a density of 0.2 million cells per well. Cells
were cultured in the presence of the indicated concentrations of inhibitors for 48 hours in triplicate wells, then pulsed
with [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham/GE Healthcare) and
cultured for an additional 16 to 18 hours. Cells were harvested onto ﬁlters using a Mach IIIM Manual Harvester 96
(Tomtec), and incorporated radioactivity was quantiﬁed by
liquid scintillation spectrophotometry on a Wallac MicroBeta
scintillation counter (PerkinElmer).
To measure the effects of inhibitors in combination with
radiation, patched mutant tumor cells were plated in 96-well
plates at a density of 0.2 million cells per well and cultured in
the presence of DMSO, 10 nmol/L BI-2536, or 30 nmol/L
VX-680. After 24 hours, cells were subjected to 0, 0.25, 0.5, or
1 Gy radiation using a Gammacell 40 Exactor (low-dose cesium
137 irradiator; Best Theratronics Ltd.). The cells were then
cultured for an additional 24 hours, and [methyl-3H]thymidine
assays were conducted as described earlier.

Targeting Aurora and Polo-like Kinases in Medulloblastoma

To determine whether Aurk or Plk inhibitors induce apoptosis in vitro, tumor cells from patched mutant mice were
isolated as described earlier and plated in 48-well plates at a
density of 0.5 million cells per well. Cells were cultured in the
presence of the indicated concentrations of inhibitors for 48
hours, then collected and suspended in 100 mL of Annexinbinding buffer containing 5 mL of Annexin V–FITC (BD Biosciences). The cells were incubated at room temperature for
15 minutes, 400 mL of Annexin-binding buffer was added, and
the percentage of Annexin V–FITC–bound cells was analyzed
using a FACSCanto ﬂow cytometer.

gene expression proﬁles to those of CD15 cells from the same
tumors (20). Our analysis revealed that CD15þ cells express
elevated levels of cell-cycle regulators, and in particular, regulators of G2–M. To validate these data, we analyzed expression
of several of these regulators by real-time reverse transcriptase
(RT)-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A–C, expression of AurkA, AurkB,
and Plk1 was signiﬁcantly higher in the CD15þ population
compared with the CD15 population in each tumor examined
(n ¼ 3). These results suggest that CD15þ and CD15 cells can
be distinguished on the basis of their expression of G2–M
regulators.

In vivo drug administration
To assess the effects of Aurk or Plk inhibition on tumor
growth, 8 million cells from patched mutant mice were suspended in 50% NB-NS21/50% Growth Factor–Reduced Matrigel
and subcutaneously injected in a total volume of 100 mL into
the ﬂanks of CD-1 Nu/Nu mice. Tumors were measured using
calipers, and tumor volumes were calculated using the formula
volume ¼ 0.52  length  width2 (26). Drug treatment was
initiated when tumors reached a volume of approximately
150 mm3. Animals were treated with 50 mg/kg BI-2536 (suspended in 0.1 N HCl, then diluted in saline) twice weekly via
tail vein. Animals treated with PHA-739358 (30 mg/kg in 5%
dextrose) were injected intraperitoneally twice daily. The animals were sacriﬁced when the largest tumor volume in the
cohort exceeded 2 cm3. After sacriﬁce, tumors were collected,
weighed, and photographed.
To determine whether Plk inhibition induces apoptosis
in vivo, tumor-bearing mice were treated with a single dose of
vehicle or BI-2536, and tumors were harvested 24 hours later
and ﬁxed overnight in 4% PFA. After ﬁxation, samples were
transferred to a solution of 30% sucrose (Sigma) for 2 days, then
embedded in Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Inc.). Samples were then stored at
80 C until sectioning (12 mm) on a Leica CM3050S Cryostat
(Leica Microsystems, Inc.). For immunostaining, tumor sections
were blocked and permeabilized for 1 hour with PBS containing
0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% normal goat serum, stained with anticleaved caspase-3 (anti-CC3) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 C, and incubated with Alexa Fluor-594
anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) secondary antibodies for 45 minutes at
room temperature. Sections were counterstained with 40 ,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen) and mounted
with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Images were acquired
using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC). Quantitation of apoptosis was conducted by acquiring images of six representative regions from four tumors from
vehicle-treated mice and four tumors from BI-2536–treated
mice and analyzing the number of CC3-positive (CC3þ) cells
relative to the DAPI-occupied area within each image using
Image Pro-Plus 7.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc.).

CD15þ cells are enriched in G2–M
The differential expression of G2–M regulators in CD15þ and
CD15 cells suggested that these populations might differ in
terms of cell-cycle distribution. To examine this, we conducted
cell-cycle analysis on freshly isolated CD15þ and CD15 cells.
Analysis of multiple tumors (n ¼ 6) indicated that compared
with the CD15 population, the CD15þ population contains a
signiﬁcantly higher proportion of cells in G2–M phase; approximately 20% of CD15þ cells reside in G2–M, compared with
approximately 5% of CD15 cells (Fig. 1D and E). A similar, but
less pronounced, enrichment was seen in the proportion of
CD15þ cells in S-phase (data not shown). These data suggest
that the elevated expression of G2–M regulators correlates with
an increased proportion of CD15þ cells in G2–M phase.

Results
CD15þ cells display elevated expression of G2–M
regulators
To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying tumor
propagation by CD15þ cells, we previously compared their

CD15þ cells progress more rapidly through the cell cycle
than CD15 cells
The increased proportion of CD15þ cells in G2–M phase
could be explained by differences in cell-cycle kinetics between
the CD15þ and CD15 populations. To address this possibility,
we pulse-labeled cells with BrdUrd and followed their progression through the cell cycle. CD15þ and CD15 cells from
patched mutant tumors were cultured in the presence of
BrdUrd for 30 minutes, and then washed and collected immediately for cell-cycle analysis or cultured for an additional 6, 12,
or 24 hours. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, BrdUrd was incorporated into both CD15þ and CD15 cells; approximately 27% of
the CD15þ cells incorporated the BrdUrd label, whereas only
7% of the CD15 cells were labeled. These data suggest that the
over-representation of CD15þ cells in G2–M phase may result,
in part, from an increased percentage of cells transiting
through the cycle.
To assess the kinetics with which each population proceeds
through S-phase and into G2–M, we examined the ratio of
BrdUrdþ cells with 4N DNA (G2–M phase) to those with DNA
content >2N and <4N (S-phase) at each time point (Fig. 2C and
Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1E). Thirty minutes after the BrdUrd
pulse, the CD15þ and CD15 populations included similar
proportions of cells in S and G2–M (G2–M:S ratios ¼ 1.05 and
1.07, respectively). However, as early as 6 hours after the
BrdUrd pulse, CD15þ and CD15 cells began to exhibit differences in cell-cycle distribution. In the CD15 population, the
G2–M:S ratio increased slowly to 1.24 at 6 hours, 1.45 at 12
hours, and 1.89 at 24 hours. In contrast, this ratio increased
much more rapidly in the CD15þ population, reaching 1.92 at 6
hours and 2.42 at 12 hours. At 24 hours, the G2–M:S ratio in the

Figure 1. CD15 cells display elevated expression of Aurk and Plk and an increased proportion of cells in G2–M. A–C, real-time RT-PCR analysis of
AurkA (A), AurkB (B), and Plk1 (C) expression in CD15þ cells and CD15 cells from patched mutant tumors (n ¼ 3). D, ﬂow cytometric analysis of DNA
content in CD15þ and CD15 cells from a representative tumor. E, quantitation of the percentage of cells in G2–M phase in the CD15þ and CD15 populations
from six separate tumors.

CD15þ population dropped sharply to 1.3, as many CD15þ cells
exited G2–M and reentered G1. Thus, CD15 cells require 24
hours to accumulate in G2–M phase at levels similar to those
reached by the CD15þ cells within 6 hours. On the basis of these
results, we conclude that CD15þ cells move through the cell
cycle more rapidly than CD15 cells and that this rapid
progression may also contribute to the over-representation of
CD15þ cells in G2–M phase.
As an alternative approach for comparing the cell-cycle
kinetics of CD15þ and CD15 populations, we followed cells
after labeling with CFSE. CFSE is equally distributed between
daughter cells during division, such that a 50% reduction in
ﬂuorescence corresponds to one cell division. Thus, the number of divisions a population of cells has undergone can be
determined by counting the number of CFSE ﬂuorescence
peaks. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1F, CD15þ and
CD15 cells incorporated similar levels of the CFSE label at
t ¼ 0. By comparing the median ﬂuorescence of the last peak
(lowest ﬂuorescence) in the CD15þ and CD15 populations to
the peak with the highest ﬂuorescence in the CD15 population (representing undivided cells) at 48, 72, and 96 hours, we
found that the majority of the CD15þ population had undergone more divisions than the CD15 population at each time
point (Supplementary Fig. S1G–S1I). Furthermore, closer
inspection of the CFSE ﬂuorescence at 96 hours after labeling
revealed that approximately 86% of the CD15þ population had
undergone four cell divisions, suggesting an average cell-cycle
time of 24 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1J–S1L). In contrast,

6314

only 5% of the CD15 population had undergone four divisions,
whereas the remaining cycling cells were relatively equally
distributed between one, two, and three divisions, suggesting
an average cell-cycle time of 60 hours. Therefore, these data
further support the conclusion that the CD15þ population
from patched mutant tumors contain a greater proportion of
cycling cells and that these cells progress through the cell cycle
more rapidly than CD15 cells.
Targeting G2–M regulators blocks progression through
the cell cycle, inhibits proliferation, and induces
apoptosis
The increased proportion of CD15þ cells in G2–M phase led
us to hypothesize that patched mutant tumors might be
sensitive to inhibitors of regulators of G2–M progression. To
address this possibility, we treated tumor cells with the Aurk
inhibitor VX-680 (tozasertib) and the Plk inhibitor BI-2536 and
examined phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10. This
residue is a direct target of AurkB (27, 28), and as shown in
Fig. 3A, the Aurk inhibitor VX-680 potently blocked its phosphorylation. Paradoxically, inhibitors of Plk1 have been reported to promote increased phosphorylation of histone 3 on serine
10 (29, 30); consistent with this, we observed increased levels
of phospho-H3Ser10 and decreased levels of serine 46 phosphorylation of TCTP (translationally controlled tumor protein,
a direct Plk1 substrate) upon treatment with BI-2536 (Fig. 3B
and data not shown). These data suggest that inhibitors of
Aurk and Plk are active in patched mutant tumor cells.

To determine the effects of Aurk and Plk inhibitors on
proliferation, we conducted 3H-thymidine incorporation assays.
As shown in Fig. 3C, treatment with 100 or 500 nmol/L VX-680
or BI-2536 caused nearly complete inhibition of proliferation.
To deﬁne the IC50 values for VX-680 and BI-2536, we treated
cells with increasing concentrations of these compounds (0.15
nmol/L to 1.5 mmol/L) and measured 3H-thymidine incorporation. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B, the IC50
values for VX-680 and BI-2536 were 23 and 4.5 nmol/L, respectively. These values are consistent with previously reported IC50
values for these drugs in other types of tumor cells (28, 29). To
further validate the antiproliferative effects of Aurk and Plk
inhibition, we assessed the sensitivity of patched mutant tumor
cells to additional Aurk or Plk inhibitors. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2C and S2D, multiple Aurk and Plk inhibitors
displayed potent antiproliferative effects. These data conﬁrm
that patched mutant tumor cells are vulnerable to small molecule–mediated inhibition of Aurk or Plk activity.
To assess the effects of these inhibitors on cell-cycle progression, we treated patched mutant tumor cells with VX-680
or BI-2536 for 24 or 48 hours. For comparison, we also treated
cells with the SHH antagonist NVP-LDE225 (LDE-225), which is
currently in clinical trials for the treatment of SHH-associated
medulloblastoma (31). As shown in Fig. 3D and E, exposure to
LDE-225 caused a progressive decrease in the number of cells
in G2–M and a concomitant accumulation of cells in G1. In
contrast, both VX-680 and BI-2536 markedly increased the
number of cells in G2–M, and at the same time, decreased the

www.aacrjournals.org

G1 population (Fig. 3D, F, and G). Treatment with each of these
inhibitors also caused an increase in the proportion of cells
with <2N DNA, most likely representing apoptotic cells. Consistent with this, VX-680 and BI-2536 each increased the
percentage of Annexin V–labeled tumor cells (Fig. 3H). These
data suggest that patched mutant tumor cells are sensitive to
Aurk or Plk inhibition and that the effects of these inhibitors on
the cell cycle are distinct from those induced by inhibitors of
the SHH pathway.
Plk inhibition cooperates with SHH antagonists and
conventional chemotherapy and radiation
Given the distinct effects of LDE-225 and VX-680 or BI-2536
on cell-cycle progression, we hypothesized that these drugs
might exert complementary or cooperative effects. To address
this possibility, we treated tumor cells with increasing concentrations (0.15–1,500 nmol/L) of LDE-225 either with or
without 10 nmol/L BI-2536, a concentration of BI-2536 that
caused minimal inhibition of proliferation on its own. As
shown in Fig. 4A, treatment with LDE-225 alone inhibited
proliferation at concentrations above 15 nmol/L, with an
IC50 of approximately 9 nmol/L. However, concomitant treatment with 10 nmol/L BI-2536 enhanced the inhibition of
proliferation at all concentrations of LDE-225 and caused the
IC50 for LDE-225 to shift to approximately 2 nmol/L, suggesting
that BI-2536 cooperates with LDE-225 to inhibit proliferation.
Similar cooperation was observed between VX-680 and LDE225 (Supplementary Fig. S3A).

To determine whether G2–M inhibitors can also cooperate
with conventional chemotherapeutic agents, we treated
patched mutant tumor cells with 10 nmol/L BI-2536 in combination with vincristine, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide, chemotherapeutic agents that are currently being used to treat
human medulloblastoma (7). Addition of BI-2536 dramatically
increased the sensitivity of the tumor cells to vincristine;
while the IC50 value for vincristine alone was approximately
5 nmol/L, the IC50 value for vincristine combined with BI-2536
was approximately 0.1 nmol/L (Fig. 4B). Similar, but less
dramatic, cooperation was observed with cisplatin (IC50 ¼ 44
nmol/L for cisplatin alone and 34 nmol/L for cisplatin þ BI2536) and with cyclophosphamide (IC50 ¼ 10 mmol/L for
cyclophosphamide alone and 8 mmol/L for cyclophosphamide

we treated patched mutant tumor cells with 10 nmol/L BI-2536
or 30 nmol/L VX-680 in combination with increasing doses (0,
0.25, 0.5, and 1 Gy) of radiation. Both BI-2536 and VX-680
signiﬁcantly enhanced the sensitivity of the cells to radiation
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). These data suggest that the
addition of BI-2536 or VX-680 can lower the concentrations of
chemo- or radiotherapy required for effective inhibition of
tumor cell proliferation.
Inhibition of G2–M regulators blocks tumor growth
in vivo
Given the strong antiproliferative effects of the Aurk and Plk
inhibitors in vitro, we next questioned whether inhibition of
G2–M regulators could affect tumor growth in vivo. Because
the Plk inhibitor BI-2536 has shown promising results in clinical trials completed thus far (32–34), we prioritized this compound for our in vivo studies. patched mutant tumor cells were

were treated twice weekly with vehicle (saline) or 50 mg/kg BI-2536. A–I, twenty-four hours after a single dose of vehicle or BI-2536, tumors were
harvested and stained with CC3 antibodies to detect apoptotic cells and DAPI to detect nuclei. Representative images from four independent vehicleþ

weeks later, mice were treated with either vehicle or BI-2536

tumors from BI-2536–treated animals contained signiﬁcantly
more CC3þ cells compared with tumors from vehicle-treated
animals (106 CC3þ cells/mm2 with BI-2536 vs. 34 CC3þ

with the Plk inhibitor causes apoptosis in vivo.

tumor-bearing mice were treated twice weekly with vehicle or
BI-2536 for 2 weeks. As shown in Fig. 5J and K, BI-2536
dramatically inhibited tumor growth, as measured by tumor
volume over time. Upon harvesting the tumors (2.5 weeks
after starting treatment), marked differences in tumor size and
weight were observed (Fig. 5L and M). Overall, tumors from the
BI-2536–treated mice were signiﬁcantly smaller and weighed
less than tumors from the vehicle-treated mice. The Aurk

100 nmol/L PHA-739358 alone caused inhibition of proliferation, as expected. However, treatment with 100 nmol/L LDE225 together with 100 nmol/L PHA-739358 further inhibited
proliferation beyond that of either compound alone. These
data suggest that, similar to the results observed in cells from
patched mutant tumors, inhibition of G2–M regulators can
cooperate with SHH pathway antagonism to block the growth
of human SHH-associated medulloblastoma.

a reduction in tumor size and weight (Supplementary Fig. S5A–
S5C). Collectively, these data suggest that inhibition of G2–M
regulators can effectively block tumor progression in vivo.
Aurk and Plk inhibitors suppress growth of human SHHassociated medulloblastoma
The studies above focused on tumors from patched mutant
mice. To determine whether G2–M inhibitors might also be
effective against human medulloblastoma, we used cells from
patient-derived xenografts that were molecularly classiﬁed as
SHH-associated medulloblastoma (Supplementary Fig. S6A
and S6B). As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment of cells from the
human SHH-associated medulloblastoma xenograft DMB-012
with BI-2536 caused a marked inhibition of proliferation,
comparable with that seen with the SHH antagonist LDE225. In addition, RCMB-018 cells, derived from a SHH-associated medulloblastoma that is insensitive to LDE-225 (due to
ampliﬁcation of SHH pathway components downstream of
SMO), were also inhibited by BI-2536 (Fig. 6B). These data
suggest that G2–M inhibitors might be useful for treating
human SHH-associated tumors, including those that display
resistance to SHH antagonists.
To address whether Aurk inhibition and SHH pathway
antagonism cooperate in human medulloblastoma, we treated
DMB-012 cells with intermediate concentrations of the Aurk
inhibitor PHA-739358 and the SHH antagonist LDE-225. As

Although treatment of medulloblastoma has signiﬁcantly
improved survival in recent years, patients often suffer severe
side effects, and better treatment strategies are still required.
Targeting medulloblastoma TPCs represents one approach to
improving treatment. Using the patched mutant mouse (a
robust model of SHH-associated medulloblastoma), we have
shown that CD15þ TPCs disproportionately reside in G2–M
phase of the cell cycle and that inhibition of Aurk or Plk using
clinically relevant agents can inhibit tumor growth in vitro
and in vivo. In addition, we have shown that these inhibitors
can block the growth of cells from patient-derived xenografts
of human SHH-associated medulloblastoma, including those
that are resistant to SHH antagonists. Our data suggest that
incorporating Aurk or Plk inhibitors into medulloblastoma
therapy could lead to improvements in treatment outcome
for patients with SHH-associated tumors.

Markant et al.

Our previous studies indicated that CD15þ TPCs from
patched mutant tumors display elevated expression of G2- and
M-phase cell-cycle regulators (20). Here, we conﬁrmed
increased expression of AurkA, AurkB, and Plk1. Each of these
serine/threonine kinases plays a distinct role in G2–M phase
progression (35). AurkA is involved in centrosome duplication,
bipolar spindle assembly, and entry into mitosis, whereas
AurkB functions in chromatin modiﬁcation, microtubule–
kinetochore attachment, spindle assembly checkpoint activation, and cytokinesis. Plk1 is involved in centrosome separation, spindle assembly and maturation, cytokinesis, and exit
from mitosis. Overexpression of each of these kinases has been
associated with poor prognosis in multiple tumor types, leading to the notion that elevated expression of these proteins
might promote tumor growth (36–42). However, given the
elevated expression of multiple G2–M regulators in CD15þ
cells, we hypothesized that the expression proﬁle reﬂected a
general property of the CD15þ population, rather than a
reliance on elevated expression of a single kinase to drive
tumorigenicity. Cell-cycle analysis of CD15þ and CD15 populations from multiple tumors demonstrated an increased
percentage of the CD15þ population residing in G2–M phase
compared with the CD15 population, suggesting that the
elevated expression of G2–M regulators in the CD15þ population is likely a result, rather than a cause, of the increased
percentage of cells residing in G2–M.
Multiple factors could contribute to the accumulation of
CD15þ cells in G2–M. One explanation is that a greater overall
percentage of CD15þ cells transit through the cell cycle,
whereas CD15 cells remain largely stationary in G0–G1 phase.
This notion is supported by the observation that the CD15þ
population also contains a greater fraction of cells in S-phase
than the CD15 population. Another possible explanation for
the accumulation in G2–M could be that the CD15þ cells arrest
in these phases of the cell cycle. To address this possibility,
we performed BrdUrd labeling and cell-cycle analysis to monitor the position of the BrdUrd-labeled cells in the cell cycle
over time. We observed greater incorporation of the BrdUrd
label in CD15þ cells, which again suggested that greater
numbers of CD15þ cells transit through the cell cycle. However,
examination of the BrdUrd-labeled cells over time indicated
that CD15þ cells do not arrest in G2–M, but actually progress
more rapidly through the cell cycle than CD15 cells. Similar
results were observed using CFSE cell division analysis.
Although these data do not exclude the possibility of transient
checkpoint activation and/or cell-cycle arrest, they indicate
that cell-cycle arrest is not a primary contributor to the overrepresentation of CD15þ cells in G2–M phase. Furthermore,
our data suggest that both increased numbers of cycling cells
and an increased pace of progression through the cell cycle
contribute to the over-representation of CD15þ cells in G2–M
phase.
We speculated that the increased residency of CD15þ cells in
G2–M phase could represent a vulnerability of these cells that
could be targeted through inhibition of G2–M regulators.
Because small-molecule inhibitors of the Aurk and Plk have
shown promising efﬁcacy in phase I and II clinical trials for
other tumor types, we selected the Aurk inhibitor VX-680 and

6320

Cancer Res; 73(20) October 15, 2013

the Plk inhibitor BI-2536 for evaluation in our studies (32,
33, 43–45). Our data show that patched mutant tumors are
indeed sensitive to Aurk or Plk inhibition; both VX-680 and BI2536 effectively blocked proliferation in vitro.
One principal aim of this study was to identify approaches
that might enhance current medulloblastoma therapy. SHH
antagonists have recently been developed for treatment of
human SHH-associated medulloblastoma (5). Both patients
and mice who receive these antagonists initially respond to
treatment, but they quickly develop resistance (6, 8, 46). Previous studies have shown that SHH signaling regulates the
transition between the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle (47–50);
consistent with these observations, our data indicate that the
SHH antagonist LDE-225 causes accumulation of cells in G1. In
contrast, the Aurk and Plk inhibitors cause accumulation in
G2–M phase. Given these distinct mechanisms of cell-cycle
inhibition, we speculated that blocking G2–M progression
might represent an additional point of intervention to target
the cells that escape sensitivity to SHH antagonists. Our data
demonstrate that the combination of LDE-225 plus BI-2536
or VX-680 has a greater inhibitory effect than treatment with
any of these compounds alone. These data suggest that clinical
combination of SHH antagonists plus Aurk or Plk inhibitors
might enhance the efﬁcacy of therapy and prevent the acquired
resistance to SHH antagonists.
Although the development of SHH antagonists has provided
additional options for therapy, most patients with medulloblastoma are still treated with conventional chemotherapy and
radiation. However, these treatments are extremely toxic and
cause signiﬁcant side effects (3). We questioned whether
addition of Aurk or Plk inhibitors might allow for a reduction
in the dose of chemo- or radiotherapy, while maintaining the
efﬁcacy of treatment. Our data show that the combination of
BI-2536 or VX-680 with chemotherapeutic agents (vincristine,
cisplatin, or cyclophosphamide) or radiation is more effective
than chemo- or radiotherapy alone. Previous studies have
shown similar effects of combined treatment of established
medulloblastoma cell lines with chemo- or radiotherapy plus
Aurk or Plk inhibitors (51–53). Together, these studies suggest
that incorporating Aurk or Plk inhibitors into medulloblastoma therapy might enable a reduction in the doses of chemotherapy/radiotherapy and thereby reduce the long-term sideeffects associated with these treatments.
The antiproliferative effects of the Aurk and Plk inhibitors in
vitro prompted us to examine the effects of the inhibitors in
vivo. Our data indicate that treatment of mice harboring
subcutaneous allografts of patched mutant tumors with BI2536 promotes apoptosis and blocks tumor growth in vivo.
These data validate the notion that targeting a vulnerability of
the TPC population using inhibitors of G2–M regulators can
block in vivo growth of SHH-associated tumors and suggest
that inhibition of Plk may represent a viable approach for
medulloblastoma treatment.
By examining the TPC population in the patched mutant
mouse model of medulloblastoma, we have identiﬁed an
opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Our data indicate
that cells from patient-derived xenografts of human SHHassociated medulloblastoma are also sensitive to Aurk or Plk

Targeting Aurora and Polo-like Kinases in Medulloblastoma

inhibition. Importantly, tumor cells that are insensitive to
SHH antagonists maintain sensitivity to BI-2536, validating
the notion that treatment with the Plk inhibitor may represent
an approach to overcome therapeutic resistance to SHH
antagonist therapy. In addition, similar to the patched mutant
tumor cells, treatment of human tumor cells with an Aurk
inhibitor plus LDE-225 blocks proliferation more effectively
than either compound alone. These data suggest that mouse
and human SHH-associated medulloblastoma are sensitive
to Aurk or Plk inhibition and that targeting these G2–M
regulators may represent an approach to prevent or overcome
resistance to SHH antagonists. Therefore, our data strongly
support the notion that incorporating Aurk or Plk inhibitors
into therapeutic strategies may improve the outcome of treatment for patients with SHH-associated medulloblastoma.
