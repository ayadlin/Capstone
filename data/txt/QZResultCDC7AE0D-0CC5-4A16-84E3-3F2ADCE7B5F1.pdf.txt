ABSTRACT
Studies have demonstrated that curcumin exerts its tumor suppressor function in
a variety of human cancers including glioma. However, the exact underlying molecular
mechanisms remain obscure. Emerging evidence has revealed that Skp2 (S-phase
kinase associated protein 2) plays an oncogenic role in tumorigenesis. Therefore, we
aim to determine whether curcumin suppresses the Skp2 expression, leading to the
inhibition of cell growth, invasion, induction of apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. To this
end, we conducted multiple methods such as MTT assay, Flow cytometry, Wound
healing assay, invasion assay, RT-PCR, Western blotting, and transfection to explore
the functions and molecular insights of curcumin in glioma cells. We found that
curcumin significantly inhibited cell growth, suppressed cell migration and invasion,
induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in glioma cells. Furthermore, we observed
that overexpression of Skp2 promoted cell growth, migration, and invasion, whereas
depletion of Skp2 suppressed cell growth, migration, and invasion and triggered
apoptosis in glioma cells. Mechanistically, we defined that curcumin markedly downregulated Skp2 expression and subsequently up-regulated p57 expression. Moreover,
our results demonstrated that curcumin exerts its antitumor activity through inhibition
of Skp2 pathway. Collectively, our findings suggest that targeting Skp2 by curcumin
could be a promising therapeutic approach for glioma prevention and therapy.

needs to overcome the blood-brain barrier and drug
resistance. Despite progress in glioma therapy regimens
such as surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or combined
modalities, the prognosis for malignant glioma patients
remains dismal [3]. Thus, it is necessary to discover new
potential therapeutic agents for the clinical studies.
A growing body of evidence implicates that
curcumin, a golden pigment extracted from turmeric,
exhibits pleiotropic activities such as antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial, antidiabetic, and neuroprotective properties [4]. Moreover,
many studies have demonstrated that curcumin exerts its

INTRODUCTION
Glioma is one of the common primary brain
tumors in adults. Due to its aggressive growth and
invasion, the median survival is generally less than one
and half years from the time of diagnosis [1]. Even in
the favorable situations, most patients with glioma die
within two years [1]. This high lethality could be due to
that surgery cannot remove entire tumor without harming
health brain. Standard treatment with temozolomide and
radiotherapy has increased the median overall survival
by 15–20 months [2]. However, chemotherapy treatment

anti-tumor activity in a broad spectrum of human cancers
including glioma [5–8]. For example, it has been reported
that curcumin inhibited cell proliferation via targeting the
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in medulloblastoma [9].
Moreover, Du et al. found that curcumin inhibited SHH
(sonic hedgehog)/Gli1 signaling pathway, leading to
inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis
in vitro and in vivo in glioma [10]. Further study showed
that curcumin exerted its antitumor activity involved in
reactivation of RANK (receptor activator of nuclear
factor κB) and inactivation of STAT3 (signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3) in glioblastoma cells [11].
Notably, curcumin synergistically enhanced paclitaxelmediated cell growth inhibition in glioma cells [12].
Additionally, curcumin was discovered to suppress
the cell growth through inhibition of HADC4 (histone
deacetylase  4) and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-B)
pathways in medulloblastoma cells [13, 14]. Although
many studies have revealed the molecular basis of
curcumin-induced cell growth inhibition, the underlying
molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.
Skp2 (S-phase kinase associated protein 2) as a key
oncoprotein has been characterized to play an oncogenic
role in tumorigenesis [15–19]. Skp2 belongs to the
ubiquitin proteosome system and exerts its oncogenic
functions via degradation of its ubiquitination targets
such as p21 [20], p27 [21], p57 [22], E-cadherin [23],
and FOXO1 (forkhead box O1) [24]. Overexpression
of Skp2 has been identified and is associated with poor
prognosis in various types of human cancers [25, 26].
Lin et al. reported that Akt interacts with and directly
phosphorylates Skp2, leading to promotion of cell
proliferation and tumorigenesis [27]. This group also
found that targeting Skp2 suppressed tumorigenesis
through Arf-p53-independent cellular senescence [28].
Our previous study has shown that Skp2 is acetylated by
p300 and subsequently promoted its cytoplasmic retention,
which enhanced cell migration through degradation of
E-cadherin [23, 29]. Chan et al. reported that the Skp2SCF (Skp, cullin, F-box containing complex) E3 ligase
activated Akt ubiquitination, herceptin sensitivity and
tumorigenesis [30]. This group further identified that
inhibition of Skp2-SCF ubiquitin ligase restricts cancer
stem cell traits and cancer progression [31]. These studies
indicate that inactivation of Skp2 could be a promising
approach for treating human cancers [32].
In the current study, we determined whether
overexpression of Skp2 promoted cell growth, migration
and invasion, but induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest. Moreover, we explored whether curcumin exhibits
its anticancer activity via inactivation of Skp2 in glioma
cells. Our results demonstrated that Skp2 was critically
involved in glioma tumorigenesis and that curcumin
down-regulated the expression of Skp2, resulting in
upregulation of p57 and down-regulation of pAkt, which
could lead to inhibition of tumorigenesis. Our findings

suggest that curcumin could be a potential efficient agent
for the treatment of glioma.

RESULTS
Curcumin inhibited cell proliferation
To detect whether curcumin treatment inhibits cell
growth in glioma cells, MTT assay was used to measure
the growth viability in U251 and SNB19 cells treated
with different concentrations of curcumin for 48 hours
and 72 hours, respectively. As expected, we found that
curcumin significantly inhibited cell growth in time- and
dose-dependent manner in both U251 and SNB19 cells
(Figure 1A). The IC50 that caused 50% inhibition of cell
growth at 72 hours for both glioma cell lines was found
to around 15 μM (Figure 1A). Therefore, we used 15 μM
curcumin in the following studies.

Curcumin induced apoptosis
It has been known that curcumin-mediated cell
growth inhibition could be due to the increased apoptosis.
Thus, we further explored whether curcumin could trigger
apoptosis in glioma cells. To achieve this goal, we detected
the effects of curcumin treatment on apoptotic cell death
using PI-FITC-annexin assay. U251 and SNB19 cells
were treated with 10, 15 μM curcumin for 48 hours. After
treatment, we measured the cell apoptosis and observed
that the induction of cell apoptosis by curcumin treatment
was dose-dependent (Figure 1B), suggesting that curcumin
treatment led to apoptosis in glioma cells.

Curcumin induced cell cycle arrest
To further define the anti-tumor effect of curcumin
on glioma cells, we conducted the cell cycle analysis
by PI staining and flow cytometry in U251 and SNB19
cells treated with 15 μM curcumin for 48 hours. We
identified a typical G2/M arrest pattern from 7% with
control to 24% with curcumin treatment in U251 cells
(Figure 1C). Similarly, curcumin treatment caused G2/M
arrest in SNB19 cells (Figure 1C). These results showed
that curcumin distinctly caused G2/M phase arrest in
glioma cells.

Curcumin inhibited cell migration and invasion
To dissect whether curcumin inhibited the motility
of the cells, we conducted the wound healing assay using
scratch approach and invasion assay using matrigel-coated
membrane. Our wound healing assay demonstrated that
curcumin significantly decreased cell migration in both
U251 and SNB19 cells (Figure 2A and 2B). Consistent with
this result, curcumin treatment led to decreased penetration
of glioma cells via the matrigel-coated membrane compared

glioma cell lines (Figure 4A). Moreover, over-expression
of Skp2 rescued cell growth inhibition by curcumin
treatment in U251 cells and SNB19 cells (Figure 4A),
suggesting that curcumin-mediated cell growth inhibition
could be in part due to down-regulation of Skp2. These
results suggest that curcumin exerts its biological function
via inactivation of Skp2 in glioma cells.

Curcumin decreased Skp2 expression
Emerging evidence has revealed that Skp2 exerts its
oncogenic functions in tumorigenesis. To determine the
molecular mechanism of curcumin-mediated anti-tumor
activities, we measured the expression of Skp2 at mRNA
and protein levels in glioma cells treated with curcumin.
Our real-time RT-PCR analysis results demonstrated that
Skp2 mRNA levels were markedly decreased in U251 and
SNB19 cells after curcumin treatment (Figure 3A). More
importantly, our Western blotting analysis showed that
curcumin also down-regulated the Skp2 protein level in
both glioma cells (Figure 3B and 3C). To further validate
the inactivation of Skp2 by curcumin could impact on
Skp2 downstream target genes such as pAkt and p57, we
detected the expression of pAkt and p57 in glioma cells
with curcumin treatment. We found that curcumin downregulated the expression of pAkt and p57 in both U251
and SNB19 cells (Figure 3B and 3C). Taken together,
curcumin exerts its anti-tumor activity through downregulation of Skp2 signaling pathway.

Over-expression of Skp2 enhanced glioma
cell motility
Next, we explored whether Skp2 could control
cell motility in glioma cell lines. The results from our
wound healing assay showed that over-expression of
Skp2 caused increased numbers of cells migrating across
the wound (Figure 4B). Consistently, our invasion assay
showed that Skp2 promoted cell invasion in both glioma
cells (Figure 4C). Strikingly, over-expression of Skp2
in combination with curcumin treatment led to lower
numbers of migrated and invasive cells compared with
curcumin treatment alone (Figure 4B and 4C). Next, we
found that overexpression of Skp2 abrogated activation
of p57 by curcumin (Figure 5A and 5B). These results
provide evidence that curcumin exhibits anti-tumor
activity through regulation of Skp2 and its target gene p57.

also showed that Skp2 siRNA inhibited pAkt activity

expression was absent or very low in well differentiated
astrocytomas  [33]. In keep of this concept, increased
levels of Skp2 was observed in 31% GBM patients
and was associated with shorter overall survival [35].
Therefore, inactivation of Skp2 could block development
and progression of glioma. Indeed, down-regulation of
Skp2 caused cell growth arrest and apoptosis in T98G
glioblastoma cells [34]. In line with these findings,
our data validated that inhibition of Skp2 retarded the
cell growth, migration, and invasion, but induced cell
apoptosis. Consistently, overexpression of Skp2 enhanced
cell growth and cell motility in U251 and SNB19 cells.
Due to oncogenic function of Skp2 in glioma,
inactivation of Skp2 could be a promising strategy for
the treatment of glioma. To this end, several compounds
have been discovered to inhibit the expression of Skp2. It
has been reported that butylidenephthalide, isolated from
Angelica sinensis, down-regulated Skp2 expression and
subsequently increased p16 and p21 expressions, leading
to cell senescence in human glioblastoma multiform [36].
Additionally, oncostatin M has been found to inhibit
the Skp2 levels in glioblastoma cells [37]. Notably,
Compound A has been discovered to block Skp2 E3 ligase
activity  [38]. It has been reported that Skp2 could be

DISCUSSION
In our present study, we found that curcumin
inhibited cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis in U251 and SNB19 glioma cells. We further
demonstrated that curcumin suppressed cell migration
and invasion in glioma cell. Mechanistically, our findings
demonstrated that curcumin exerts its anti-tumor functions
through down-regulating Skp2 expression in glioma cells.
These results revealed that curcumin could be an effective
agent for treating glioma.
Multiple studies have demonstrated that Skp2
has an essential oncogenic function in the pathogenesis
of glioma [33–35]. For example, Skp2 was diffusely or
focally expressed in most glioblastomas, whereas Skp2

inhibited by caffeic acid phenethyl ester and curcumin in
cancer cell lines [39–42]. Recently, Compound 25, also
known as SZL-P1–41, was developed as a Skp2 inhibitor
and inhibited Akt-mediated glycolysis and induced cellular
senescence [31]. These inhibitors could have side effects
in clinical trials. Due to non-toxic nature, inhibiting Skp2
by nature agents could be a safer approach for treating
glioma. In this study, our results demonstrated that
curcumin inhibited Skp2 expression in glioma cell lines.
We further validated that curcumin exerts its anti-tumor
function partly through down-regulation of Skp2. These
findings indicated that curcumin may be a useful agent for
achieving better treatment of human glioma.
Emerging evidence has shown that Akt can directly
bind to Skp2 and phosphorylate its serine 72, leading to
the translocation of Skp2 from the nucleus to cytoplasm
and activation of oncogenic function of Skp2 [27, 43].
However, one study found that Akt drives Skp2 and FOXO1
to the cytoplasm [44, 45]. Further study demonstrated that
Skp2 triggered Akt activation in human breast cancer [30].
In support of this note, we observed that Skp2 increased
Akt activation in U251 and SNB19 glioma cells. Moreover,
curcumin inhibited Skp2 target gene expression including
Akt and p57. One study has shown that FoxM1 (Forkhead
box protein M1) activated the expression of Skp2 in
glioblastoma [46]. Curcumin was reported to suppress
FoxM1 expression in human acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) [47]. It is possible that curcumin down-regulated
Skp2 expression due to inhibition of FoxM1. However,
further investigation is required to explore this possibility.
It is noteworthy to note that the therapeutic use of curcumin
is hampered because of its rapid metabolism and poor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

absorption. It has been suggested that 2–20 μM curcumin
for cancer cell lines, 50–200 mg/kg curcumin for mouse
treatment, and 8–12 g/day for human trial were utilized
[48–50]. Without a doubt, it is necessary to improve the
bioavailable of curcumin and to overcome the blood-brain
barrier. It is also required to determine whether curcumin
exerts its anti-cancer function through inhibiting Skp2
expression in glioam mouse models in vivo. In conclusion,
our studies provided that the inhibition of cell growth,
induction of cell apotposis and cell cycle arrest, suppression
of cell invasion and migration in glioma cell by curcumin
could be partly through down-regulation of Skp2, suggesting
that inhibiting Skp2 by curcumin could be an potential
effective approach to treat glioma.

(St. Louis, MO). Curcumin was dissolved in DMSO to
make a 30 mM stock solution and was added directly to
the media at different concentrations. Cells were treated
with 0.1% DMSO as the control group.

Briefly, transfected cells were seeded in the upper chamber
with 200 μl serum-free medium and there is 500 μl
complete medium in the under chamber with the same

and then transferred onto a Polyvinylidene Fluoride
(PVDF) membrane, and then incubated with primary
antibody at 4°C overnight. After washed with TBST
for three times and incubated with second antibody at
room temperature for one hour. Then the expression
of protein was detected by electrochemiluminescence
(ECL) assay.

Cell scratch assays
U251 cells and SNB19 cells were cultured in 6-well
plate. After cells converged almost 100%, absorbed the
supernatant and scratched the cells with a yellow pipette
tips. Then washed the cells with PBS and added medium
with curcumin. The scratched area was photographed with
a microscope at 0 h and 20 h, respectively, as described
before [51].

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using
GraphPad Prism 4.0 (Graph Pad Software, La Jolla, CA).
Student’s t-test was performed to evaluate statistical
significance. Results were presented as means ± SD.
