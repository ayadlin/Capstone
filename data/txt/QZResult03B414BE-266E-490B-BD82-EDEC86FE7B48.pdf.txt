ABSTRACT
Overexpression of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 in tumor tissues is considered
a major cause of limited efficacy of anticancer drugs. Gene expression of ABC
transporters is regulated by multiple mechanisms, including changes in the DNA
methylation status. Most of the studies published so far only report promoter
methylation levels for either ABCB1 or ABCG2, and data on the methylation status
for ABCC1 are scarce. Thus, we determined the promoter methylation patterns of
ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 in 19 human cancer cell lines. In order to contribute to
the elucidation of the role of DNA methylation changes in acquisition of a multidrug
resistant (MDR) phenotype, we also analyzed the promoter methylation patterns in
drug-resistant sublines of the cancer cell lines GLC-4, SW1573, KB-3-1 and HL-60. In
addition, we investigated if aberrant promoter methylation levels of ABCB1, ABCC1
and ABCG2 occur in tumor and tumor-surrounding tissues from breast cancer patients.
Our data indicates that hypomethylation of the ABCC1 promoter is not cancer
type-specific but occurs in cancer cell lines of different origins. Promoter methylation
was found to be an important mechanism in gene regulation of ABCB1 in parental
cancer cell lines and their drug-resistant sublines. Overexpression of ABCC1 in MDR
cell models turned out to be mediated by gene amplification, not by changes in the
promoter methylation status of ABCC1. In contrast to the promoters of ABCC1 and
ABCG2, the promoter of ABCB1 was significantly higher methylated in tumor tissues
than in tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant tissues from breast cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

lung cancer, frequently develop resistance after an initial
positive response (acquired resistance) [1]. Multidrug
resistance (MDR), the simultaneous resistance to a broad
range of structurally unrelated drugs with different modes
of action, is a particular challenge in cancer treatment [2].
Chemotherapy resistance can be caused by
mechanisms in the cancer cells and/or by characteristics
of the tumor microenvironment [3]. Microenvironmentrelated factors include the composition of the extracellular

Chemotherapy, surgery and radiation therapy are
today´s main pillars of cancer treatment. The efficacy of
chemotherapy is, however, limited due to drug resistance.
For some types of cancer, e.g. cancers derived from colon,
kidney, adrenal gland, liver and pancreas, resistance
often exists even before chemotherapy started (intrinsic
resistance). Other types of cancer, e.g. breast and small cell

doxorubicin. Hypomethylation of the ABCG2 promoter has
for example been found in ABCG2-overexpressing sublines
of MCF-7, CCRF-CEM, IGROV1 (ovarian carcinoma)
and A549 (non-small cell lung cancer) cells [29]. To our
knowledge, only one study has investigated the promoter
methylation status of ABCC1 [30]. Methylation levels of
ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 have been determined in the
pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 and its drug-resistant
subline SW1990/GZ, obtained by selecting SW1990 for
resistance to gemcitabine. Although expression of the three
ABC transporters was significantly higher in SW1990/GZ
than in SW1990 cells, the promoters of ABCB1, ABCC1
and ABCG2 were found to be hypomethylated, in both,
the MDR subline and the parental cell line [30]. With the
exception of Chen et al. [30] and Oberstadt et al. who
investigated the methylation status of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in
glioblastoma [31], studies reporting DNA methylation levels
in cancer cell lines and/or clinical tumor samples focused on
either ABCB1 [27, 28, 32–40] or ABCG2 [29, 41–43].
In the present study we aimed to enlarge the
database by determining the promoter methylation patterns
of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 in cancer cell lines derived
from different types of cancer, MDR cell models as well
as tumor, tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant tissues from
breast cancer patients. First of all, we were interested if
ABCC1 hypomethylation is cancer type-specific or also
occurs in other types of cancer than pancreatic cancer.
Knowledge of the promoter methylation patterns of
ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 in cancer cell lines will
be helpful, e.g. in selecting an appropriate cell line for
investigating the mode of action and/or testing the efficacy
of potential chemotherapeutic drugs. In MDR sublines of
the small cell lung cancer cell line GLC-4, the non-small
cell lung cancer cell line SW1573, the epidermal cervical
cancer cell line KB-3-1 and the promyelocytic leukemia
cell line HL-60, the promoter methylation patterns of
the three ABC transporters were determined in order to
contribute to elucidation of the role of DNA methylation
changes in acquisition of a MDR phenotype. Data obtained
by array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH),
whole genome gene expression arrays and Western Blots
was used to investigate if the promoter methylation status
is linked to copy number variation and expression at the
gene and/or protein level.
A few papers indicate that hypermethylation of
the ABCB1 promoter is a frequent event in breast cancer
[34, 36, 38], so far, data on promoter methylation of
ABCC1 and ABCG2 has, however, not been published.
Changes in the DNA methylation status are known to be
an early event in carcinogenesis. They have been detected
not only in tumors but also in tumor-adjacent tissue that
appeared histologically normal. The presence of molecular
abnormalities in tumor-surrounding tissues is called
field cancerization or field defect [44]. We determined
the methylation patterns in tumor, tumor-adjacent and
tumor-distant tissues from the same breast cancer patients

matrix, cell-cell interactions and the vasculature [4, 5].
Intracellularly, processes that limit drug uptake or increase
drug inactivation, drug efflux or the repair of DNA
lesions caused by cancer treatment reduce the efficacy of
chemotherapy [6].
By functioning as efflux pumps, ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters play a crucial role in MDR of
cancers. Based on their sequence homology and the number
and location of transmembrane domains, the members of
the human ABC transporter superfamily have been grouped
into seven subfamilies (ABCA - ABCG) [7]. ABCB1,
ABCC1 and ABCG2 are the ABC transporters most
frequently been associated with MDR in cancers [8, 9].
In healthy tissues, ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2
are physiologically relevant because they protect the
body from a variety of toxic endogenous and exogenous
compounds by transporting them across cell membranes,
even against very steep concentration gradients [10–12].
ABCB1 can transport neutral and cationic hydrophobic
compounds [13, 14], whereas ABCC1 predominantly
transports xenobiotic organic anions conjugated with
glutathione, glucuronic acid or sulphate [15]. In addition
to conjugated organic anions, ABCG2 has been reported to
transport phosphorylated nucleosides and nucleotides [16].
Overexpression of ABCB1, ABCC1 and/or ABCG2
in tumor tissues is considered a major cause of limited
efficacy of anticancer drugs. Increased levels of ABCB1
are commonly found in intrinsically resistant cancers [17].
Overexpression of ABCC1 has been linked to MDR in
small cell lung carcinoma, prostate and breast cancer as well
as childhood neuroblastoma [18]. High levels of ABCG2
have been associated with MDR in acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia and non-small cell
lung cancer. Increasing evidence suggests that ABCG2 is
involved in MDR of cancer stem cells [19, 20].
Although the amino acid sequences of ABCB1,
ABCC1 and ABCG2 are quite different, their resistance
profiles are significantly overlapping [21, 22]. Each of the
three ABC transporters confers resistance to anthracyclines
(e.g. doxorubicin and daunorubicin), epipodophyllotoxins
(e.g. etoposide and teniposide) and campothecins.
Cancer cells overexpressing ABCB1 and/or ABCC1 are
also resistant to Vinca alkaloids (e.g. vincristine) and
colchicine. Among the three ABC transporters, ABCB1
is the only one conferring resistance to taxanes (e.g.
paclitaxel and docetaxel) [9].
Gene expression of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 is
regulated by multiple mechanisms at both the transcriptional
and post-transcriptional level [23–25]. In addition,
epigenetic mechanisms including changes in the DNA
methylation status and histone modifications are known
to play a role by regulating the structure of chromatin.
Hypomethylation of the ABCB1 promoter has been detected
e.g. in MDR sublines of the human T-cell leukemia cell line
CCRF-CEM [26] and the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 [27,
28], obtained by selecting the parental cells for resistance to

in order to investigate if aberrant promoter methylation
levels of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 can be used as
indicator for detection of field cancerization in breast
cancer. We also evaluated if there is a correlation between
the promoter methylation status of ABCB1, ABCC1 and
ABCG2 and if the methylation levels are associated with
any of the clinicopathological parameters.

targeted by the bisulfite PSQ method and the sequence
to analyze for ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2. The ABCB1
method allows determining the methylation status of
seven CpGs downstream of the TSS (+524, +526, +554,
+556, +580, +583, +587). The methods for ABCC1 and
ABCG2 target eight CpGs upstream of the TSS (ABCC1:
–214, –208, –201, –193, –180, –176, –174, –170; ABCG2:
–357, –351, –345, –337, –334, –329, –319, –316).
Representative pyrograms are shown in Figure 2. In the
pyrogram for ABCC1, the variable positions (Y = C or T)
appear in the same order as in the sequence to analyze
shown in Figure 1, because the forward strand of the DNA
was used for primer design. Since in case of ABCB1 and
ABCG2, the primers were designed by using the reverse
strand, the sequence reaction was performed in the
opposite direction, as indicated by the numbering of the
CpGs in the sequences to analyze in Figure 1.
Each of the PSQ methods was found to be applicable
to determine the methylation status in cancer cell lines and
biopsy samples from breast cancer patients. The limit of
quantification (LOQ), determined by repeatedly analyzing
bisulfite-treated unmethylated control DNA, was found to
be 5%.

RESULTS
Development and validation of bisulfite
pyrosequencing methods for ABCB1, ABCC1
and ABCG2
Bisulfite pyrosequencing (PSQ) methods for
ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 were developed in-house.
For each method, the concentrations of the forward
and reverse primer and the annealing temperature were
optimized. PCR conditions resulting in the highest amount
of specific PCR product without leading to the formation
of unspecific products are summarized in Table 1. Figure 1

array) and/or the protein level (Western Blotting) had
been determined previously. In SW480 and U2-OS
cells, ABCB1 was expressed at both, the mRNA and the
protein level. In U2-OS cells, ABCB1 was found to be
overexpressed (Figure 4A). Moderate ABCB1 mRNA and
ABCB1 levels were determined in HCT116 cells.
In the cell lines DMS114, HCC827, HCT116,
SW480, A2780 and U2-OS, ABCC1 was found to be
expressed at the mRNA level (Figure 4B). With the
exception of HCC827, mRNA expression was accompanied
with (moderate) expression of ABCC1. In the cell lines
A549, NCI-H520, SW1573, KB-3-1 and MG-63, ABCC1
was expressed at the protein level (expression at the mRNA
level was not determined).
Only few cell lines (DMS114, A549, HCC827 and
MCF-7) were found to express ABCG2 (Figure 4C).
In HCC827 cells, low levels of ABCG2 mRNA were
detected.

The promoter methylation status of ABCB1, ABCC1
and ABCG2 (Figure 1) was determined in 19 cancer cell
lines: the small cell lung carcinoma DMS114 and GLC- 4;
the non-small cell lung carcinoma A549, HCC827,
NCI-H520, NCI-H1703 and SW1573; the colorectal
carcinoma HCT116 and SW480; the breast cancer cell
models MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and ZR- 75– 1; the cervical
cancer cell line KB-3-1; the ovarian carcinoma A2780; the
prostate cancer cell line PC-3; the osteosarcoma MG-63 and
U2-OS; the multiple myeloma U266 and the promyelocytic
leukemia HL- 60. Overall, the cell lines showed big
differences in the extent of promoter methylation of
ABCB1 (Figure 3A). According to their methylation
status, the cancer cell lines could be divided into three
groups. In seven cancer cell lines (GLC-4, DMS114,
A549, NCI-H520, U2-OS, MG-63 and U266), the average
methylation status (across the seven CpGs investigated)
was found to be < 20%, in DMS114 cells it was even
< LOQ (< 5%). In eight cell lines (KB-3-1, HCC827,
SW1573, NCI-H1703, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, PC-3 and
HL-60), the target region was highly methylated (average
methylation status > 75%). Intermediate methylation levels
ranging from 37 to 54% were found for SW480, HCT116,
A2780 and ZR-75-1 cells. In several cancer cell lines, e.g.
ZR-75-1, A549 and A2780, the promoter region of ABCB1
was methylated rather heterogeneously.
In none of the 19 cancer cell lines the average
methylation status of the ABCC1 promoter (across the eight
CpGs investigated) was found to be ≥ 5% (Figure 3B).
Moreover, the average methylation status of the ABCG2
promoter (across the eight CpGs in the sequence to
analyze) was even < LOQ in five cancer cell lines (A2780,
KB-3-1, MDA-MB-231, HCT116 and U266) (Figure 3C).
In four cell lines (PC-3, NCI-H1703, SW1573 and HL-60),
the eight CpGs were highly methylated (methylation status
ranging from 70 to 97%). In the remaining ten cell lines,
the average methylation status was between 5 and 32%.

Promoter methylation patterns of ABCB1,
ABCC1 and ABCG2 in MDR cell models
The promoter methylation status of ABCB1, ABCC1
and ABCG2 (Figure 1) was determined in GLC-4/adr, an
adriamycin-resistant subline of GLC-4, two adriamycinresistant sublines of SW1573, namely SW1573/2R120
and SW1573/2R160, two drug-resistant sublines of KB3-1, KBC-1 (selected against colchicine) and KB-1089
(selected against the thiosemicarbazone KP1089) and two
drug-resistant sublines of HL-60, HL-60/adr (adriamycinselected) and HL-60/vinc (vincristine-selected). In
addition, we analyzed GLC-4/rev, an adriamycin-revertant
subline of GLC-4/adr.
No significant difference was found in the extent of
ABCC1 promoter methylation between GLC-4, GLC-4/adr
and GLC-4/rev cells, with all three cell lines showing an
average methylation status below or slightly higher than
5% (Figure 5A). In contrast, the seven CpGs in the ABCB1
promoter showed a methylation status ≥ LOQ in GLC- 4,
GLC-4/adr and GLC-4/rev cells (with the exception
of CpG5 in GLC-4 cells). In the adriamycin-resistant
subline, CpG1, CpG2 and CpG5 were significantly higher
methylated than in the parental cell line, whereas in the
revertant subline, CpG1, CpG2, CpG6 and CpG7 were
significantly lower methylated than in GLC-4/adr cells.
With the exception of CpG6, no significant difference was
found between the ABCB1 promoter methylation status in
GLC-4/rev and the parental cells. In the ABCG2 promoter,
CpG1, CpG3, CpG4, CpG5 and CpG7 were significantly
higher methylated in GLC-4/adr than in GLC-4 cells. In
contrast to ABCB1, no significant difference was found in
the ABCG2 promoter methylation status between GLC-4/
adr and GLC-4/rev cells. However, for CpG1 and CpG3
significant differences between GLC-4/rev and GLC-4
cells were detected. In addition to the DNA methylation
changes observed for ABCB1 and ABCG2, selection of

in the copy number of ABCB1 and ABCC1 was observed
in HCC827 and GLC-4 cells, respectively.

GLC-4 cells for resistance to adriamycin was associated
with a highly significant decrease (from 89 to 65%,
p < 0.001) in the DNA methylation status of LINE-1 (long
interspersed nuclear element 1), a surrogate marker of
global DNA methylation (data not shown). No significant
difference was found between LINE-1 methylation in
GLC-4/adr and GLC-4/rev cells.
In accordance to the results described above, the
ABCC1 promoter was hypomethylated (average methylation
status < LOQ) in the parental cell line SW1573 and its drugresistant sublines SW1573/2R120 and SW1573/2R160
(Figure 5B). In SW1573/2R160, the ABCB1 promoter
was significantly lower methylated than in the parental
cell line. A lower methylation status was also observed for
SW1573/2R120, in CpG2, CpG3 and CpG6 the difference
(compared to the parental cell line) was statistically
significant. No significant difference was found in the
methylation status of ABCG2 between the parental cell line
and its two adriamycin-resistant sublines.
In the cell line KB-3-1 and its drug-resistant
sublines KBC-1 and KB-1089 (Figure 5C), the promoters
of ABCC1 und ABCG2 were unmethylated (average
methylation status < LOQ). In contrast, a difference was
found in the promoter methylation status of ABCB1.
In KB-3-1 cells, the seven CpGs investigated showed
a methylation status ≥ 65%, whereas in KBC-1 the
methylation status was ≤ 6%. In KB-1089 cells, CpG1CpG5 were significantly lower methylated than in the
parental cell line.
In HL-60 and its drug-resistant cell lines HL60/adr and HL-60/vinc, the promoters of ABCB1 and
ABCG2 were highly methylated, whereas that of ABCC1
was found to be unmethylated (< LOQ) (Figure 5D). No
difference was detected between the parental cell line and
the drug-resistant sublines.

in SW1573/2R160 and SW1573/2R120 cells, respectively.
KBC-1 but not KB-1089 cells showed higher expression
of ABCB1 than the parental cell line KB-3-1. KB-1089
cells, however, overexpressed ABCC1 and ABCG2. In the
drug-resistant sublines HL-60/vinc and HL-60/adr, higher
ABCC1 levels were detected than in the parental cell line
HL-60. In addition, HL-60/vinc overexpressed ABCB1.

Promoter methylation patterns of ABCB1,
ABCC1 and ABCG2 in tumor, tumor-adjacent
and tumor-distant tissues from breast cancer
patients and normal breast tissues from the
healthy control group
Our three bisulfite PSQ methods were applied to
determine the promoter methylation levels of ABCB1,
ABCC1 and ABCG2 (Figure 1) in biopsy samples from
16 breast cancer patients. From each patient, three tissue
specimens were analyzed: tumor tissue, tumor-adjacent
tissue (about 1 cm distance to the tumor) and tumor-distant
tissue (about 3 cm distance to the tumor).
In each of the tumor, tumor-adjacent and tumordistant tissues as well as in breast tissues from healthy
women, the ABCC1 promoter was hypomethylated
(methylation status < LOQ). The seven CpGs in the ABCB1
promoter were found to be methylated (methylation status
≥ 5%) in at least eleven of the 16 tumor tissues (Figure 7A).
In tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant tissues, the target
region was less frequently methylated than in tumor tissues.
In tumor-distant tissues, CpG1-CpG4 and CpG7 showed
less frequently a methylation status ≥ 5% than in tumoradjacent tissues. CpG1 and CpG2 were methylated in three
and CpG4 and CpG6 in one out of four breast tissues from
healthy women. In all normal breast tissues, the methylation
status of CpG3, CpG5 and CpG7 was < 5%. Figure 8
summarizes the methylation levels of the ABCB1 promoter
in tumor (Figure 8A), tumor-adjacent (Figure 8B) and
tumor-distant (Figure 8C) tissues from the 16 breast cancer
patients. In tumor tissues, the average methylation status
(across the seven CpGs investigated) ranged from < LOQ
to 46%. In several patients (patients 1, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 and
14) the target region was methylated heterogeneously. In
all tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant tissues, the average
methylation status was found to be ≤ 10%.
With the exception of CpG7, the CpGs targeted
in the ABCG2 promoter were methylated (methylation
status ≥ 5%) in at least 14 out of the 16 tumor, tumoradjacent and tumor-distant tissues (Figure 7B). In the
breast tissues from healthy women, the eight CpGs were
also found to be methylated, with the exception of CpG7
in one tissue. The methylation levels of ABCG2 obtained
for tumor, tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant tissues are
summarized in Figure 9. In general, the ABCG2 promoter
was methylated more homogenously than the promoter of
ABCB1. In accordance to the results obtained for ABCB1,
tumor tissue of patient 11 showed the highest methylation

Copy number variation of ABCB1, ABCC1 and
ABCG2 in MDR cell models
Compared to GLC-4, GLC-4/adr showed gene
amplification of ABCC1 as well as a gain in copy numbers
of ABCB1 and ABCG2 (Figure 6). ABCB1 and ABCC1
were amplified in both drug-resistant cell lines of SW1573,
SW1573/2R120 and SW1573/2R160. However, ABCB1
was also amplified in the parental cell line. In addition,
gene amplification of ABCC1 was detected in the drugresistant cell lines KB-1089 and HL-60/adr, compared to
their parental cell lines KB-3-1 and HL-60, respectively.

tissues, the average methylation status was ≤ 22%. In most

status was ≤ 20%.

comprising CCND2 (cyclin D2), DAPK1 (death-associated
protein kinase 1), GSTP1 (glutathione S-transferase P1),
HIN-1 (high in normal-1), MGMT (O6-methylguanineDNA methyltransferase) and RASSF1A (Ras association
domain family member 1), in tumor, tumor-adjacent and
tumor-distant tissues from the same breast cancer patients
by methylation-sensitive high resolution melting analysis
[45]. We did not find a statistically significant correlation
between the average methylation status of the ABC
transporters and that of CCND2, DAPK1, GSTP1, HIN-1,
MGMT or RASSF1A.

Correlation between the promoter methylation
levels of different genes
Statistical analyses revealed that in tumor tissues the
average promoter methylation status of ABCB1 (across the
seven CpGs investigated) significantly correlated with the
average promoter methylation status of ABCG2 (across
the eight CpGs investigated) (r = 0.621; p = 0.010). In

analysis, bisulfite PSQ is less costly in terms of money,
labor and time. The bisulfite PSQ methods applied were
developed in-house. Primers for ABCB1, ABCC1 and
ABCG2 were designed to target CpG-rich fragments
of the respective promoters. We were interested in the
DNA methylation status of the main promoters known
to regulate most of the transcriptional activity but not
in that of alternative promoters linked to tissue-specific
gene expression [20, 46]. The method for ABCB1 is
applicable to determine the methylation status of seven
CpGs downstream of the TSS, the methods for ABCC1
and ABCG2 target eight CpGs upstream of the respective
TSS (Figure 1). The functional relevance of the DNA
methylation status of the seven CpGs in the ABCB1
promoter has been discovered recently. A significant
difference was found in the DNA methylation status of
these CpGs between parental SW480 cells and SW480/
tria, a triapine-resistant subline overexpressing ABCB1
[47]. In addition, Reed et al. reported significant
hypomethylation of this region in drug-resistant sublines
of MCF-7 compared to the parental breast cancer cell line
[28]. The sequence to analyze of the ABCB1 promoter has
been predicted to contain binding sites for glucocorticoid
receptor-alpha (GR-α), yin-jang 1 (YY1) and general
transcription factor II-I (TFII-I) [48]. YY1, involved in
regulation of gene transcription and protein modifications,
is assumed to play a proliferative or oncogenic role in
carcinogenesis [49], whereas TFII-I is known to be a
mediator of growth factor signalling. The eight CpGs
targeted by our ABCC1 method are directly upstream of
the CpGs that have been found to be hypomethylated
in the pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 and its drugresistant subline SW1990/GZ [30]. The sequence to
analyze contains a putative binding site for paired box 5
(Pax5) [48], which is assumed to play an oncogenic role
in B cell malignancies [50]. The eight CpGs in the ABCG2
promoter are overlapping with the CpGs targeted by To
et al. [41] or in close distance to the regions investigated
in previous studies [29, 31, 42]. The sequence to analyze
has been predicted to contain a binding site for c-jun, a
well-known proto-oncogene [48].
	 The 19 human cancer cell lines investigated in
the present study were found to differ in the methylation
status of the ABCB1 and ABCG2 promoter. However, in
each of the cell lines, the ABCC1 promoter was found to
be unmethylated (average methylation status across eight
CpGs ≤ 5%). In most cell lines, the ABCB1 promoter
was higher methylated than the ABCG2 promoter, with
the exception of the two small cell lung cancer cell lines
GLC-4 and DMS114, the non-small cell lung cancer cell
line A549 and the prostate cancer cell line PC-3.
Among the small cell lung cancer cell lines, in GLC4 cells the promoters of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 were
found to be higher methylated than in DMS114 cells.
Quite different methylation levels were obtained
for the five non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

investigated. In two cell lines, SW1573 and NCI-H1703,
both the ABCB1 and ABCG2 promoter showed a
methylation status in the range from 70 to 90%. In A549
and NCI-H520 cells, the average methylation status of
the ABCB1 and ABCG2 promoter was ≤ 20% and 32%,
respectively. In contrast, in HCC827 cells, the ABCB1
promoter was found to be highly methylated (average
methylation status 78%), whereas the ABCG2 promoter
only showed an average methylation status of 5%. The
histological type of the lung cancer (adenocarcinoma:
A549, HCC827; squamous: SW1573, NCI-H520,
NCI-H1703) was not found to have an impact on the
methylation status of the ABCB1 and ABCG2 promoters.
Our results are in accordance with a previous study pointing
to differences in the ABCB1 promoter methylation status
between various lung cancer cell lines [43]. In the study of
Bram et al. [29], in A549 cells the ABCG2 promoter (CpGs
from −380 to +6 relative to the TSS) has been found to be
devoid of methylation which is a discrepancy to our results.
In the two colon cancer cell lines, HCT116 and
SW480, the average methylation status of ABCB1 was
about 40%. In SW480 cells the ABCG2 promoter was
higher methylated (18%) than in HCT116 cells (< 5%).
ABCB1 promoter methylation in HCT116 cells has already
been reported previously [51].
In all three breast cancer cell lines investigated, the
ABCB1 promoter was found to be highly methylated. The
ABCG2 promoter was methylated (average methylation
status 13–21%) in the estrogen receptor-positive cell
lines MCF-7 (HER2-negative, Luminal A) and ZR-75-1
(HER2-positive, Luminal B), but was < LOQ in the triple
negative cell line MDA-MB-231. Hypermethylation of the
ABCB1 promoter (CpGs from -164 to about +600 relative
to the TSS) in MCF-7 cells has already been reported by
David et al. [27]. Bram et al. [29] have found MCF-7 cells
to be devoid of ABCG2 promoter methylation (CpGs from
−380 to +6 relative to the TSS).
In the prostate cancer cell line PC-3, both the
ABCB1 (79%) and the ABCG2 (97%) promoter were
highly methylated. Hypermethylation of the ABCB1
promoter has already been reported for several prostate
cancer cell lines including PC-3 [37], DU145 and ND1
cells [32]. In both, the cervix cancer cell line KB-3-1
and the ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780, the ABCB1
promoter was found to be highly methylated, whereas the
ABCG2 promoter was unmethylated. In both osteosarcoma
cell lines investigated, promoter methylation levels of
ABCB1 and ABCG2 were in the range from 10 to 17%. In
the multiple myeloma cell line U266, the ABCB1 promoter
was found to be slightly methylated, that of ABCG2
was < LOQ. In the promyelocytic leukemia HL-60, the
promoters of ABCB1 and ABCG2 were highly methylated.
Extensive ABCB1 promoter methylation in HL-60 cells
has been described previously [52].
Results obtained by whole genome gene expression
array and Western Blot analyses indicate that in the cancer
73362

cell lines investigated, the promoter methylation status
of ABCC1 is not associated with mRNA and/or protein
expression levels. Although in general, the eight CpGs
were unmethylated (methylation status < LOQ), some
cancer cell lines (e.g. DMS114, NCI-H520 and SW1573)
expressed, whereas others (e.g. GLC-4, MCF-7 and
HL- 60) did not express ABCC1.
In cancer cell lines with (weak) expression of
ABCG2 (DMS114, A549, HCC827 and MCF-7), the mean
promoter methylation status of ABCG2 was in the range
from 5 to 32%. Although in e.g. NCI-H520, HCT116
and KB-3-1 cells, the mean promoter methylation status
of ABCG2 was also very low, ABCG2 expression was,
however, not detected. Thus, the promoter methylation
status of the eight CpGs targeted by PSQ is not assumed
to be involved in gene regulation of ABCG2.
In contrast, in some cancer cell lines, promoter
methylation of ABCB1 was found to be inversely
correlated with gene expression at the mRNA and/or
protein level. The cancer cell lines HCC827, SW1573,
KB-3-1 and HL-60, which showed high promoter
methylation status of ABCB1, did not express ABCB1.
In HCT116, SW480 and U2-OS cells, displaying low
to moderate methylation status of the ABCB1 promoter,
ABCB1 was found to be expressed at both the mRNA
and protein level. This finding indicates that promoter
methylation is an important mechanism in gene regulation
of ABCB1.
Copy number variation analyses revealed that the
copy numbers of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 were not
associated with the promoter methylation levels of the
three ABC transporters.
Currently, numerous studies are carried out
attempting to overcome MDR in cancer. The data on the
methylation patterns of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2
provided in the present study will help in selecting
appropriate cancer cell lines for investigating the mode of
action and/or testing the efficacy of (epigenetic) anticancer
drugs.
In order to further elucidate the role of DNA
methylation changes in acquisition of a MDR phenotype,
we determined the methylation patterns of ABCB1,
ABCC1 and ABCG2 in several MDR cell models. In GLC4/adr and GLC-4/rev, an adriamycin-revertant subline of
GLC-4/adr, the ABCC1 promoter showed a methylation
status < LOQ, independent of the ABCC1 expression level
in the cells. Results obtained by array CGH indicate that
overexpression of ABCC1 in GLC-4/adr is mediated by
gene amplification. In GLC-4/adr cells, both the ABCB1
and ABCG2 promoter were higher methylated than in
the parental cell line. The difference in the methylation
status was statistically significant in three and five CpGs,
respectively. In addition, in GLC-4/adr cells we observed
significant lower methylation of LINE-1 compared to the
parental cell line. Our results indicate that acquisition of
the MDR phenotype was associated with a substantial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

decrease in global DNA methylation. Methylation levels
determined for GLC-4/rev suggest that changes in the
promoter methylation status of ABCB1 were, at least
in part, reversed by culturing the MDR subline without
selection pressure.
In the parental cell line SW1573 and its drugresistant sublines SW1573/2R120 and SW1573/2R160,
the ABCC1 promoter was found to be unmethylated
(average methylation status < 5%), independent of the
expression level of ABCC1. Array CGH analysis showed
that the (over)expression of ABCC1 in SW1573/2R120
and SW1573/2R160 cells is based on gene amplification.
As expected, in the ABCB1- and ABCC1-overexpressing
subline SW1573/2R160, the ABCB1 promoter was
significantly lower methylated than in the parental cell
line. Gene amplification of ABCB1 was observed for the
two adriamycin-resistant sublines, but also for the parental
cell line. For ABCG2, no significant difference was found
between the parental cell line and its two adriamycinresistant sublines, neither in the methylation status, nor in
the expression levels or the gene copy numbers.
In KB-3-1 and its drug-resistant sublines KBC-1
and KB-1089, the promoters of ABCC1 and ABCG2 were
unmethylated (methylation status < LOQ). These results
indicate that overexpression of ABCC1 and ABCG2 in
KB-1089 cells is not mediated by DNA methylation. Array
CGH analysis revealed that overexpression of ABCC1
is due to gene amplification. However, overexpression
of ABCG2 seems to be mediated by an alternative
mechanism. Overexpression of ABCB1 in KBC-1 cells
is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the promoter
methylation status of ABCB1. Although KB-1089 cells
were not found to express ABCB1, CpG1-CpG5 were
significantly lower methylated than in the parental cell line.
For none of the ABC transporters, a significant
difference in the methylation status was found between
HL-60 and its two drug-resistant sublines HL-60/vinc and
HL-60/adr, although HL-60/vinc was found to overexpress
ABCB1 and ABCC1 and HL-60/adr overexpresses
ABCC1. Overexpression of ABCC1 in HL-60/adr was
associated with amplification of ABCC1.
Our results are in accordance with previous studies
reporting that the overexpression of ABCB1 in MDR
cancer cells is mediated by a decrease in ABCB1 promoter
methylation [26, 27]. Our data on ABCC1 is consistent
with that of Chen et al. [30] who have not found a
difference in ABCC1 promoter methylation between
the pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 and its ABCC1overexpressing subline SW1990/GZ.
A few papers indicate that hypermethylation of
the ABCB1 promoter is a frequent event in breast cancer
[34, 36, 38], so far data on promoter methylation of ABCC1
and ABCG2 has, however, not been published. Since
changes in the DNA methylation status are known to be an
early event in carcinogenesis, we analyzed tumor, tumoradjacent and tumor-distant tissues from the same breast

accordance with the study of Muggerud et al. [36], Dejeux
et al. [34] have observed a trend for the absence of ABCB1
promoter methylation in basal-like breast tumors.
For each of the seven CpGs in the ABCB1 promoter
investigated, a statistically significant difference was
found between tumor and tumor-adjacent tissue, tumor
and tumor-distant tissue as well as between tumor and
normal breast tissues of the control group. However, no
difference was found between tumor-adjacent and tumordistant tissues. In addition, no difference was found in the
methylation status of the ABCG2 promoter between tumor,
tumor-adjacent, tumor-distant tissues and breast tissues
from healthy women. These results indicate that neither
the ABCB1 nor the ABCG2 promoter methylation status
is applicable as indicator for detecting field cancerization
in breast cancer.
Statistical analyses revealed that in tumor tissues
the average promoter methylation status of ABCB1
significantly correlated with that of ABCG2. However, we
did not find a correlation between the methylation status of
ABCB1 or ABCG2 and that of CCND2, DAPK1, GSTP1,
HIN-1, MGMT or RASSF1A determined previously [45].
In patients with post-menopausal status, the methylation
levels of CpG3-CpG7 in the ABCB1 promoter were
significantly higher than in patients with pre-menopausal
status. In addition, methylation levels of CpG6 and CpG7
were found to positively correlate with the age of the
patients. Tumor-adjacent tissues from patients with tumor
grade 3 showed significantly lower methylation status
of CpG7 than tumor-adjacent tissues from patients with
tumor grade 1 or 2. In addition, positive correlations
were found between MIB-1 and the methylation status of
CpG6 and CpG7 in the ABCG2 promoter in the tumordistant tissues. In a previous study, lower ABCB1 promoter
methylation levels have been reported for Ki67-positive
tumors than for Ki67-negative ones [36].
In conclusion, in-house developed bisulfite
PSQ methods were applied to determine the promoter
methylation status of ABCB1, ABCC1 and ABCG2 in
19 human cancer cell lines, MDR cell models as well as
tumor, tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant tissues from 16
breast cancer patients. In all cancer cell lines, the ABCC1
promoter was found to be unmethylated. However, the
cancer cell lines showed substantial differences in the
promoter methylation status of the ABCB1 and ABCG2
promoters. In some cancer cell lines, promoter methylation
of ABCB1 was found to be inversely correlated with gene
expression at the mRNA and/or protein levels, indicating,
that promoter methylation is an important mechanism
in gene regulation of ABCB1. Analysis of MDR cell
models revealed that overexpression of ABCB1 is linked
to a decrease in ABCB1 promoter methylation, whereas
upregulation of ABCC1 was frequently mediated by
gene amplification. The ABCC1 promoter was found
to be hypomethylated in all tumor, tumor-adjacent and

cancer patients to find out if aberrant DNA methylation
levels even occur in tissues that appear histologically
normal. In contrast to the ABCC1 promoter which was found
to be hypomethylated (methylation status < LOQ) in all
tumor, tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant tissues, the ABCB1
and ABCG2 promoters were found to be methylated very
frequently. Each of the CpGs in the ABCB1 and ABCG2
promoters was methylated in ≥ 75% of the tumor tissues.
In a previous study, ABCB1 promoter methylation has been
detected in 39.3% of 28 small invasive ductal carcinomas
[36]. By investigating several regions of the ABCB1
promoter, Dejeux et al. [34] have observed methylation in
64 – 81% of locally advanced breast tumors. Klajic et al.
[38] have reported ABCB1 promoter methylation in 47.6%
(invasive stage I tumors) to 70% (invasive stage IV tumors)
of a total of 238 breast cancer tissue samples. In contrast to
our results and those published by Muggerud et al. [36] and
Klajic et al. [38], Sharma et al. [35] have found the ABCB1
promoter to be hypomethylated in 47% of tumors from 100
invasive ductal breast carcinoma patients. In the present
study, the ABCB1 promoter was more frequently methylated
in tumor tissues than in tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant
tissues, whereas in case of the ABCG2 promoter, no
difference was found between the three tissue specimens. In
each of the breast tissues from the control group, the ABCC1
promoter showed an average methylation status < 5%. In
three of four normal breast tissues from healthy women, the
ABCB1 promoter was unmethylated, whereas the ABCG2
promoter was found to be methylated (average methylation
status from 6 to 19%) in all breast tissues from the control
group. Our data on ABCB1 promoter methylation in normal
breast tissues is consistent with the study of Muggerud et al.
[36] reporting absence of DNA methylation around the TSS
in normal breast tissue.
In the tumor tissues analyzed in the present study,
the average ABCB1 promoter methylation status ranged
from < LOQ to about 50%, whereas in most tumoradjacent and tumor-distant tissues, the average methylation
status was ≤ 10%. In case of ABCG2, all tumor tissues
except one showed an average methylation status < 25%.
In most tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant tissues, the
average methylation status was ≤ 22%. Strikingly, the
highest methylation status of both the ABCB1 and ABCG2
promoter was obtained for a triple negative breast tumor.
In addition to the triple negative status, the tumor showed
a high proliferative activity (MIB-1: 70%). However, since
it was the only triple negative tumor sample analyzed in
the present study, we cannot draw any conclusions from
our result. As described above, in the triple negative
cell line MDA-MB-231 the ABCB1 promoter was
highly methylated. However, the ABCG2 promoter was
unmethylated (average methylation status < LOQ). In
a previous study, for estrogen receptor-positive tumors
higher ABCB1 promoter methylation levels have been
reported than for estrogen receptor-negative ones [36]. In

tumor-distant tissues from breast cancer patients as well
as in breast tissues from healthy women. In contrast,
the promoters of ABCB1 and ABCG2 were found to be
methylated in ≥ 75% of the tumor tissues. The ABCB1
promoter was more frequently methylated in tumor
tissues than in tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant tissues,
whereas for the ABCG2 promoter, no difference was
found between the three tissue specimens. Statistically
significant differences were found in the ABCB1 promoter
methylation status between tumor and tumor-adjacent
tissue, tumor and tumor-distant tissue as well as between
tumor and normal breast tissues from the control group.

patients, including age, menopausal status, histologic type,
histological grading, B classification, proliferative activity
(MIB-1), status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor
2 (HER2) as well as the molecular subtype. Three biopsy
samples were taken from each patient by ultrasound guided
needle biopsies. The first biopsy sample was taken directly
from the primary breast tumor (“tumor tissue”), the second
one from histologically normal tissue located about 1 cm
from the tumor (“tumor-adjacent tissue”) and the third
one from histologically normal tissue located about 3 cm
from the center of the tumor (“tumor-distant tissue”). Noncancerous breast tissue samples were collected from four
women undergoing breast reduction mammoplasty. The
age of these women ranged from 44 to 60 years (mean:
53 years). Tissues from breast cancer patients and healthy
controls have already been included in a previous study
[45]. Biopsy samples were stored in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) at −80°C until DNA extraction.
When the biopsy samples were drawn, we were
solely interested in DNA methylation analysis. Due to the
specific sample preparation procedure applied, the samples
could not be subjected to gene expression analysis later on.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
The following 19 human cancer cell lines were
used in this study: small cell lung carcinoma cell lines
DMS114 and GLC-4; non-small cell lung carcinoma
cell lines A549, HCC827, NCI-H520, NCI-H1703 and
SW1573; colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines HCT116
and SW480; breast adenocarcinoma cell lines MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231; breast ductal carcinoma cell line
ZR-75-1 derived from metastatic site (ascites); epidermal
cervical cancer cell line KB-3-1; ovarian carcinoma cell
line A2780; prostate cancer cell line PC-3; osteosarcoma
cell lines MG-63 and U2-OS; multiple myeloma
cell line U266; and promyelocytic leukemia cell line
HL-60. The study also included the following drugresistant sublines: GLC-4/adr (and its revertant subline
GLC-4/rev), SW1573/2R120, SW1573/2R160, KBC-1,
KB-1089, HL-60/adr and HL-60/vinc. These cancer cell
lines were selected because they were available in our lab
and originated from a broad variety of tissue types. All
details (tissue origin, disease, growth medium and source)
regarding the different human cancer cell lines used in
this study are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Culture
media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(PAA, Austria). Cell cultures were periodically checked
for mycoplasma contamination. Cell line authentication
was performed by array CGH and/or short tandem repeat
fingerprint.

DNA methylation analysis by bisulfite
pyrosequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from cell lines and
breast tissue samples by using the QIAamp DNA Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer´s
instruction. The extracted DNA was quantified using a
Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific,
USA). Human control DNA (CpGenome Universal
Methylated DNA and EpiTect Control DNA (human),
unmethylated) was obtained from Millipore (USA) and
Qiagen, respectively.
DNA extracted from cancer cell line pellets and
breast tissue samples as well as human control DNA was
converted with sodium bisulfite by using the EpiTect
Fast Bisulfite Conversion Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Bisulfite pyrosequencing methods were developed
in-house. The nucleotide sequences of ABCB1 [GenBank:
NG_011513.1], ABCC1 [GenBank: NG_028268.1] and
ABCG2 [GenBank: NG_032067.2] were taken from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
database [53]. Promoter regions were identified using the
Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED)
[54]. Transcription factor binding sites were predicted on
the PROMO site [48] (ABCB1 and ABCC1: dissimilarity
margins were set ≤ 0%; ABCG2: dissimilarity margin was
set ≤ 3%).
Primers were designed with the PyroMark Assay
Design Software 2.0.1.15 (Qiagen). For each primer set the
annealing temperature (Ta) and the primer concentrations
were optimized. Primer sequences and optimized

Patients and breast tissue samples
Breast tissue samples were collected from 16 breast
cancer patients at diagnosis. The study was approved
by the Ethics Commission of the Medical University of
Vienna (application number EK 2011/1074). All breast
cancer patients gave written informed consent. The age of
the patients ranged from 39 to 76 years (mean: 58 years).
None of the women had a family history of breast cancer.
In addition, none of the patients had received radiotherapy,
chemotherapy or hormonal treatment. Table 2 gives
information on the characteristics of the breast cancer

MIB-1: mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (proliferative activity), IDC: invasive ductal carcinoma, ILC: invasive
lobular carcinoma, ER: estrogen receptor, PR: progesterone receptor, HER2: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, n.s.:
not specified.

conditions are summarized in Table 1. Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was performed using the PyroMark PCR
Kit (Qiagen). The reaction volume per well was 25 µl,
including 12.5 µl PyroMark PCR Master Mix (2×), 2.5 µl
CoralLoad Concentrate (10×), forward and reverse primer,
RNase-free water and 10 ng of bisulfite converted DNA.
Amplification was performed on an iCycler instrument
(Bio-Rad, USA) under the following conditions: initial
activation step at 95°C for 15 min, 50 cycles: 30 s at 94°C,
30 s at the respective annealing temperature (Table 1),
30 s at 72°C and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The
identity and purity of the PCR products were determined
by randomly loading them onto a 2% agarose gel in 1×
TAE buffer. After staining with GelRed (Biotium, USA)
bands were visualized with an UVT-20 M transilluminator
(Herolab, Germany).
Pyrosequencing analyses were performed using
the PyroMark Q24 Advanced instrument (Qiagen) and
PyroMark Q24 Advanced CpG Reagents (Qiagen).
Sample preparation was carried out with the PyroMark
Q24 Vacuum Workstation (Qiagen). In brief, 15 μl
of biotinylated PCR product was mixed with 1 μl
Streptavidin Sepharose High Perfomance (GE Healthcare,
Germany), 40 μl PyroMark Binding Buffer and 24 µl highpurity water (Milli-Q 18.2 MΩ) and agitated for 10 min

on a shaker at 1400 rpm. The double stranded DNA was
denatured, washed and finally transferred into a PyroMark
Q24 Plate (Qiagen) containing 20 µl of 0.375  μM
sequencing primer. The plate was transferred to a preheated (80°C) PyroMark Q24 Plate Holder (Qiagen), hold
at 80°C for 5 min and then transferred into the instrument.
Pyrosequencing data was evaluated with the PyroMark
Q24 Advanced software 3.0.0 (Qiagen).
All samples were analyzed at least twice. A no
template control was included in each run, serving as
control for contamination.

Array comparative genomic hybridization
(array CGH)
Isolation of genomic DNA and array CGH analysis
were performed as described in [55] using 4 × 44K whole
genome oligonucleotide-based arrays (Agilent, Canada).
Labeling and hybridization procedures were performed
according to the instructions provided by Agilent using
the SureTag DNA Labeling Kit. Slides were scanned
with a G2505B Micro Array Scanner (Agilent). Feature
extraction and data analysis were carried out using the
Feature Extraction and Agilent Genomic Workbench
software, respectively.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out with IBM
SPSS Statistics 21.0. When we investigated if the
promoter methylation status of ABCB1, ABCC1 and/
or ABCG2 is associated with clinicopathological
characteristics of the breast cancer patients (Table 2),
methylation data was treated as categorical variable by
dividing the levels into two categories, “methylation
status < LOQ” and “methylation status ≥ LOQ”.
If the methylation status was treated as continuous
variable, methylation levels < LOQ (< 5%) were
substituted with a default value, namely half the LOQ
(2.5%), as proposed previously [58]. Chi-squared
test was used to evaluate if the methylation status of
individual CpGs in the promoter was associated with
any of the clinicopathological parameters. One-way
ANOVA (analysis of variance), followed by posthoc Tukey´s HSD (honest significant difference)
test was applied to test for significant differences in
the DNA methylation status between tumor, tumoradjacent and tumor-distant tissues as well as tissues
from the healthy control group. Pearson´s correlation
coefficient was used to assess the relationship
between two continuous variables. In all cases, a
p value < 0.05 (two-sided) was considered significant.
